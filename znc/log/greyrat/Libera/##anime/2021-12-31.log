[00:56:40] <Ooga> Is this IRC channel secure?
[00:56:43] <Satin> no
[00:56:47] <Satin> but it's fine as is
[00:56:48] <ButterNoodle> irc is not secure
[00:56:51] <Ooga> Oh.
[00:56:57] <Ooga> Well that's reassuring.
[00:57:03] <Bco1981> you are on the internet... and ask if it's secure...
[00:57:04] <KatrinValerie> IRC is basically broadcasting anything you say here to the general public forever
[00:57:05] <Satin> but if you're going to say illegal shit don't expect the feds to not see
[00:57:10] <ButterNoodle> anything u say is logged
[00:57:14] <ButterNoodle> !seen nsa
[00:57:18] <Satin> PERMANANT MESSAGE ON THE IRC BLOCKCHAIN: meow
[00:57:22] <DaPinkOne> the server permits unencrypted comms, they may log themselves, and anyone in a channel may be logging
[00:57:27] <Ooga> The NSA will only get my nuts on display.
[00:57:28] <KatrinValerie> Satin: the feds can go lick my blockchain or something
[00:57:30] <Ooga> That is all.
[00:57:31] <ImoutoBot> ButterNoodle: nsa was last seen in #anime 9 months and 5 days ago: <NSA> Mekely: wrong date?
[00:57:32] <Satin> KatrinValerie: lol
[00:57:33] * ButterNoodle finger popps ImoutoBot
[00:57:38] <KatrinValerie> I am not even in their juristinction
[00:57:44] <Satin> KatrinValerie: xD
[00:57:45] <DaPinkOne> iirc there's a flag to force users to connect over SSL
[00:57:53] <Satin> Ooga: we have a bunch of UK users here
[00:58:00] <KatrinValerie> And I have no intention of visting capitalist imperialistic america
[00:58:00] <Satin> like Jigsy 
[00:58:01] <Omega037> ButterNoodle, hard to use a PC in bed
[00:58:04] <Ooga> Satin: Fellow britons.
[00:58:07] <Ooga> Excellent.
[00:58:07] <Jigsy> I deny everything.
[00:58:13] <Ooga> I can tell them Devon is the best UK county.
[00:58:14] <Jigsy> I have witnesses!
[00:58:20] <MootPoot> Imagine being anything other then canadian - can't relate
[00:58:24] * MootPoot looks down on you all
[00:58:25] <DaPinkOne> KatrinValerie, good. this place is worse than where you are, i'm sure
[00:58:34] <Omega037> I probably will still use my PC at times, since I have tracking setup via anilist
[00:58:40] <Satin> america is ok, has issues but it's ok
[00:58:49] <Jigsy> Issues?
[00:58:52] <Satin> yea
[00:58:54] <Satin> issues.
[00:58:54] * MootPoot chugs maple syrup while riding a moose with a antler-slingshot loaded with a beaver
[00:58:55] <Jigsy> More like an entire fucking subscription.
[00:58:59] <Satin> Jigsy: lol
[00:59:06] <KatrinValerie> DaPinkOne: well, I am in a sort of comfortable position, yet kinda locked in place for the time being :/
[00:59:15] <ButterNoodle> MootPoot: shoot that beaver in my mouth pls
[00:59:19] <KatrinValerie> still got to wait till next year to find out if I can even switch uni
[00:59:24] <Omega037> I also added a 128GB SD card into it, so I can download 10000s of manga chapters for local storage
[00:59:29] <KatrinValerie> and if I cannot, I am back to square one
[00:59:43] <DaPinkOne> KatrinValerie, problems with your degree?
[00:59:56] <Ooga> I use Tachiyomi on my tablet for manga.
[01:00:01] <KatrinValerie> Yeah, I havent been able to properly study since corona started
[01:00:05] <Ooga> But for PC? I dont read manga on PC.
[01:00:05] <Omega037> Ooga, same
[01:00:15] <KatrinValerie> and now I took a vacation semester because of how ruined I am
[01:00:27] <Omega037> This is basically refurbished Kindle Fire HD 8+ and a 128 GB SD card
[01:00:28] <Ooga> Omega037: It's also a major pain in the backside because sometimes some extensions wont update certain manga.
[01:00:31] <DaPinkOne> they only take so many credits here, so either you get the associates before transfer to uni, or you start over
[01:00:37] <Ooga> I'm on like, the 30th chapter of Nagatoro.
[01:00:40] <KatrinValerie> DaPinkOne: don't get me wrong, I am getting better already, the amount of BS I went through these last two years was absurde though.
[01:00:41] <Omega037> I just used Fire Toolbox to remove the Amazon bloat
[01:00:45] <Ooga> Already I need to swap to a different vendor.
[01:00:48] <Omega037> Then installed Tachiyomi
[01:00:48] <Ooga> : l
[01:00:51] *** Quits: ZdrytchX (~ZdrytchX@45.122.218.139.sta.wbroadband.net.au) (Quit: Aaaah!)
[01:01:08] <Ooga> I didnt modify my tablet, just got tachiyomi off F-droid.
[01:01:13] <DaPinkOne> KatrinValerie, you looking at transfering to an online university or something?
[01:01:16] <Satin> I haven't been able to study properly since covid either
[01:01:22] <Satin> but the shooting just added onto that
[01:01:23] <Omega037> You can get a Fire HD 8 for like $60
[01:01:25] <Ooga> Do you use AnimeKisa for anime? Omega037
[01:01:27] <Satin> so i took a year off untinetnionally
[01:01:40] <DaPinkOne> Satin, shooting?
[01:01:43] <Omega037> Ooga, I normally watch stuff on my PC or TV
[01:01:48] <Ooga> Omega037: I got a glorious chinese communist tablet.
[01:01:52] <Ooga> Huwaei M5
[01:01:53] <Omega037> I wouldn't watch shows on a tablet or phone
[01:01:54] <KatrinValerie> DaPinkOne: I moved cities because my former relationship fell apart and I almost got shot by a cop in a swatting and just could not shake of that constant feeling of dread in that city
[01:01:56] <Satin> DaPinkOne: ye, i got shot by carjackers dec 2020
[01:01:59] <Satin> around new years
[01:02:11] <Satin> i was doordashing at the time
[01:02:11] <DaPinkOne> Satin, :O
[01:02:14] <Satin> took in 5 bullets etc
[01:02:18] <Ooga> You could technically store your fave manga on a big ass USB and plug it in your smart TV
[01:02:22] <Ooga> I've done this before.
[01:02:26] <Satin> but yeah i emailed professors from the ICU to tell them i couldn't make it because... reasons
[01:02:28] <Satin> :^)
[01:02:28] <Ooga> But not practical unfortunately.
[01:02:32] <Omega037> I have that already, Ooga
[01:02:35] <Omega037> I have a media server
[01:02:38] <Satin> and was hospitalized for the entireity of jan 2021
[01:02:38] <KatrinValerie> DaPinkOne: and ended up with my ex-es girlfriends ex smh
[01:02:47] <Ooga> A linux media server?
[01:02:51] <Omega037> The Amazon Kindle Fires are basically subsidized tablets
[01:02:53] <DaPinkOne> damn, y'all have had a shitty year
[01:03:05] <Ooga> My year was good.
[01:03:05] <Satin> eh, and i withdrew from all classes for Fall 2021
[01:03:12] <KatrinValerie> DaPinkOne: there is so much more to this story
[01:03:13] <Ooga> I recently got a IT job this October.
[01:03:14] <Satin> because trying to work w/ untreated PTSD is shitty
[01:03:15] <Ooga> : )
[01:03:18] <Satin> but I think I'm settled now
[01:03:22] <Satin> to try Spring 2022
[01:03:26] <Ooga> So I am feeling rather positive about 2022 for my job.
[01:03:28] <Satin> starts in jan now
[01:03:29] <KatrinValerie> Satin: I feel you
[01:03:46] <Ooga> Does Joe Biden have a favourite waifu?
[01:03:49] <Satin> ye i have tremors and stuff, but thankfully i don't have nightmares often and stuff
[01:03:52] <Ooga> That is the question.
[01:03:54] <Satin> Ooga: probably
[01:03:58] <MootPoot> Bide Joeden
[01:04:01] <KatrinValerie> already had ptsd before almost being murdered and then sexually humiliated by cops
[01:04:04] <Ooga> I bet Trump probably likes tomboy waifus.
[01:04:08] <Ooga> Wouldn't put past him.

[01:04:23] <Ooga> What the..
[01:04:27] <Ooga> :o
[01:04:28] <Bco1981> Tomo-chan
[01:04:36] <Ooga> Biden-Sama has very nice wrinkles.
[01:05:13] <KatrinValerie> People should really consider that having a dakii with a design of a real person is kinda creepy
[01:05:21] <KatrinValerie> unless that person is consenting to the existence of that daki
[01:05:37] <DaPinkOne> KatrinValerie, I consider most daki to be a bit creepy, real person or not
[01:05:56] <MootPoot> DaPinkOne: you should leave :<
[01:06:03] <MootPoot>  /s
[01:06:04] <DaPinkOne> MootPoot, :P
[01:06:05] <MootPoot> :3
[01:06:11] <Omega037> I'm hoping we get a decent cost of living increase
[01:06:17] <Satin> MootPoot: sounding like jigs there
[01:06:23] <Omega037> Anything less than 5% is basically a pay cut
[01:06:29] <MootPoot> Satin: I'm channeling his essence while he's not here
[01:06:38] <DaPinkOne> Omega037, inflation \o/
[01:06:38] <Satin> lul
[01:06:54] <Satin> I ran yesterday hmmmmmmm
[01:07:00] <Satin> i can't run today but i'll walk for 30m
[01:07:16] <MootPoot> I cant walk today so I'll sit for 30m
[01:07:17] <Ooga> You cant run from me.
[01:07:22] <Ooga> The Ooga-Booga.
[01:07:26] <DaPinkOne> Satin, it's good to have rest days. muscles need time to rebuild
[01:07:28] <Satin> ooga booga
[01:07:36] <Satin> DaPinkOne:  yeah, and i've had achilles tendonitist before
[01:07:43] <Satin> twice when trying to get into running
[01:07:49] <Satin> but i was also a retard back then and did stuff like hill running
[01:07:51] <Satin> or whatever
[01:07:57] <Satin> without knowing a clue of how damaging that is
[01:08:00] <MootPoot> when you want to get into running, you have to start with lying down
[01:08:03] <Omega037> it is hard for large companies to make big pay raises though
[01:08:09] <MootPoot> I've been practicing for years
[01:08:10] <DaPinkOne> Omega037, bullshit
[01:08:11] <Satin> Omega037: ask google that
[01:08:17] <Omega037> word is our bonus will be like 1.5x the normal amount
[01:08:27] <Satin> i know you work in biotech and not tech directly but still
[01:08:33] <Ooga> My name is Ooga
[01:08:36] <Satin> tech companies... what you said doesn't apply at all
[01:08:38] <Ooga> But I go BOOGA.
[01:08:40] <Omega037> Satin, I am not saying ALL companies
[01:08:46] <Satin> i see
[01:08:54] <Omega037> And I didn't say it was impossible, just hard
[01:08:58] <MootPoot> afaik they can do big raises, but the thing is they dont want to - they only will raise you  based off your current salary even if you're worth like 50% more
[01:09:00] <Ooga> The women say I got a large DOOGA
[01:09:01] <Omega037> It is easier when the company has a ton of cash
[01:09:19] <Ooga> Companies don't need cash.
[01:09:24] <Ooga> We can just give them like..
[01:09:24] <DaPinkOne> Omega037, it's hard because they've decided it's hard. it's internal decisions, not resources.
[01:09:26] <Ooga> socks.
[01:09:29] <Satin> Ooga: that's not how it works
[01:09:29] <Satin> smh
[01:09:30] <Ooga> Everyone needs socks.
[01:09:37] <Omega037> I'm not defending it
[01:09:38] <Ooga> Even big bosses of a major international company.
[01:09:42] <Omega037> I am saying that is how it is
[01:09:56] <Ooga> Omega037: Socks are important to the economy and society abroad.
[01:09:59] <Omega037> Large companies tend to give smaller raises
[01:10:11] <Omega037> Again, not some universal rule
[01:10:23] <Omega037> But an accurate observation
[01:10:25] <Ooga> Speaking of pay.
[01:10:31] <Omega037> It is why I don't expect a huge bump
[01:10:35] <Ooga> For some reason I was only at the job for 2 weeks.
[01:10:43] <Omega037> I would have to jump to another job to get that
[01:10:44] <Ooga> And already I was payed a rather big sum.
[01:11:02] <Ooga> Either because they realized I am the Ooga Booga.
[01:11:16] <Ooga> Or because it was just a nice christmas bonus package.
[01:11:19] <Satin> Omega037: existing pay is already quite a bit, is part of why?
[01:12:34] <Omega037> Not really
[01:12:53] <Omega037> It is partially inertia
[01:13:12] <Omega037> But basically, you get evaluated against your current salary at the same company
[01:13:24] <Omega037> While a new company evaluates you fresh
[01:13:38] <Ooga> Evaluation to see what it takes for you to go up against the Ooga Booga.
[01:14:07] <Ooga> Right you know what? I will stop with these dumb remarks.
[01:14:21] <Omega037> It is also why they suddenly can come up with some more money if you have a competing offer in hand
[01:14:23] <Ooga> Why are you guys discussing about payment and seizing the means of companies ownership etc?
[01:14:38] <Omega037> I was just talking about pay
[01:14:54] <MootPoot> seize the womb of production
[01:14:54] <Ooga> You'll get paid if you talk about how great the Ooga is.
[01:14:56] <Omega037> The end of the fiscal year is when stuff like pay and bonuses are usually decided
[01:15:07] <Ooga> If you dont, then you get a bag of rocks for your birthday.
[01:15:15] <Ooga> That is the way of the Ooga Booga.
[01:15:47] <Ooga> MootPoot: You.
[01:16:03] <Omega037> Ooga, how much money is "a lot"?
[01:16:19] <Ooga> I am not being snooty but.
[01:16:25] <MootPoot> no you -> Ooga 
[01:16:28] <Ooga> I was paid like £450? 500?
[01:16:36] <Omega037> per?
[01:16:51] <Ooga> It was literally on the 23rd of this month.
[01:16:55] <Ooga> Before christmas eve.
[01:16:59] <Omega037> So?
[01:17:07] <Ooga> Well.. My role is an apprentice.
[01:17:19] <ButterNoodle> ?
[01:17:22] <Omega037> Are you salaried?
[01:17:28] <ButterNoodle> is there some kinda global psychosis going on
[01:17:31] <Ooga> Every certain day of the month I am paid.
[01:17:42] <Ooga> But I got paid despite only being there for 2 weeks.
[01:17:51] <Omega037> Maybe it was prorated?
[01:17:56] <Ooga> Probably.
[01:18:05] <Omega037> Their payroll schedule doesnt adapt to your needs
[01:18:06] <ButterNoodle> 3 different irc networks... 3 different active channels... all three with low tier trolling attempts
[01:18:11] <Omega037> Could be tax or insurance related too
[01:18:12] <Ooga> I want to spend it on an Ooga Booga funko pop empire.
[01:18:15] <Ooga> Imagine.
[01:18:22] <Omega037> ButterNoodle, i wanted to talk about many
[01:18:23] <ButterNoodle> can we get an all caps nick in here to start talking shit..
[01:18:24] <Omega037> manga&
[01:18:28] <Ooga> An Ooga in every house hold.
[01:18:41] <ButterNoodle> naaa
[01:18:43] <Omega037> Ooga, is 500 pounds a lot of money?
[01:18:50] <ButterNoodle> I flush that shit Ooga..
[01:18:52] <Ooga> Omega037: To me it sure bloody is.
[01:18:57] <ButterNoodle> sounds like the devils work
[01:19:11] <Ooga> Thats literally half a grand.
[01:19:14] <Ooga> For 2 weeks.
[01:19:20] <ButterNoodle> grand or gram?
[01:19:23] <ButterNoodle> cocaine?
[01:19:30] <DaPinkOne> ButterNoodle, maybe it's just the holidays
[01:19:31] <Ooga> ButterNoodle: I'll sniff you like cocaine sugarbaby.
[01:19:31] <MootPoot> half a grand for 2 weeks?
[01:19:40] <ButterNoodle> Ooga: only off my dick tip pls
[01:19:40] <MootPoot> I get paid like 2x that for a internship
[01:19:41] <MootPoot> lol
[01:19:47] <Ooga> MootPoot: Flex.
[01:19:57] <ButterNoodle> DaPinkOne: probably.. everyone wants to share misery
[01:19:59] <MootPoot> 500 bucks is like a lot of money to someone who dosen't ahve bills
[01:20:04] <Omega037> wait, are we flexing?
[01:20:08] <ButterNoodle> or a job MootPoot
[01:20:13] <ButterNoodle> kek
[01:20:14] <MootPoot> ^
[01:20:18] <ButterNoodle> paycheck flex
[01:20:22] <Ooga> Hey man.
[01:20:24] <Ooga> Money is money.
[01:20:31] <Ooga> I am just glad to be working again is all.
[01:20:32] *** Quits: aHick (~memes@71.219.219.100) (Ping timeout: 268 seconds)

[01:21:16] <MootPoot> gonna beat sablr in 9 min then shower
[01:21:23] <MootPoot> I'm hot, oily and sweaty and not in a good way
[01:21:30] <Ooga> You're oily and sweaty?
[01:21:32] <Omega037> I make about $3700 every 2 weeks, after taxes, insurance, and 8% towards retirement
[01:21:39] <Omega037> not including bonuses and such
[01:21:44] <Ooga> Wow.
[01:21:54] <Ooga> Thats pretty cool.
[01:21:59] <MootPoot> thats like actual money
[01:22:10] <ButterNoodle> Omega037: I thought u had a masters or something
[01:22:13] <Ooga> Actual money
[01:22:19] <Omega037> I also have 3 kids, a mortgage, and my wife and I have 6 figs student loans
[01:22:24] <MootPoot> enough to sustain an apartment, a car, and yourself with some luxuries
[01:22:37] <MootPoot> or well, all the crap Omega037 has
[01:22:39] <Ooga> You're a busy dad eh?
[01:22:45] <Omega037> To put it this way Ooga, I pay $1200-1500 a month in student loan repayment the next 17 years
[01:22:53] <Ooga> Jesus.
[01:22:54] <ButterNoodle> damn
[01:22:58] <Ooga> Yeah no thank you.
[01:23:09] <ButterNoodle> I wont complain about my $250 a month loan

[01:24:21] <ButterNoodle> it was like 1/3rd my salary before tax..
[01:24:41] <Omega037> Not including the 4 year LTI (long term incentive) bonus that I dont see for 4 years, but will be around 20k
[01:25:01] <Omega037> What is funny is that I don't make nearly as much as a lot of my peers
[01:25:18] <Omega037> Since I don't really job hop
[01:25:38] <ButterNoodle> ur what 130K annually?
[01:25:54] <Omega037> at the moment, $137k and change

[01:26:08] <Omega037> 18% annual bonus, 15% LTI
[01:26:18] <Omega037> But bonus is based on company performance

[01:26:30] * MootPoot is at a palrty 30k annually
[01:26:40] <ButterNoodle> mine is based on sales

About $150 for a Bratza Encore will work though if you can afford better do. Some manual grinders might have a better cost/quality but I did not look to much into manual grind

[05:35:02] <Fenderbassist> the desert air out here dries the neck wood, so it shrinks....but the metal frets don't, so you have an Edward Scissorhands experience until you have them filed down lol
[05:35:15] <ButterNoodle> nice what cha get?
[05:35:29] <Fenderbassist> two Fender Player Precision basses
[05:35:51] <Fenderbassist> one in Buttercream with a white pickguard, one in Black with a white pickguard, both with maple fretboards

[05:46:31] <Fenderbassist> I also quit coffee for a while now, been occasionally having tea but daily having tons of water

[05:47:32] <Fenderbassist> hmm never had barley tea, I have a collection of puerh I'm slowly working on while I age it
[05:48:10] <amigojapan> Fenderbassist: barley tea has no caffeine
[05:48:23] <Fenderbassist> it is considered an herbal tea?
[05:48:46] <Fenderbassist> years ago I would occasionally have red clover tea, was supposed to help cleanse the body
[05:48:55] <amigojapan> I guess so. Tho barley is a grain
[05:48:55] <Fenderbassist> that was an "herbal" tea
[05:49:11] <Fenderbassist> like goldenseal, passion flower, etc.
[05:49:50] <Fenderbassist> hey as long as you like it, and it's healthy enough, cool
[05:49:55] <amigojapan> Fenderbassist: it's not bad at all

[06:16:32] <Fenderbassist> whole foods
[06:16:53] <Fenderbassist> alfalfa capsules for minerals as well

[06:20:04] <Fenderbassist> it at least allows the body to do what it can do, won't be a "magic bullet" fix but it's better than junk food and soda full of phosphorus to drive calcium out 
[06:20:21] <amigojapan> I guess at least I want it to degrade as slowly as possible
[06:21:15] <Fenderbassist> a handful of people I know that "lived on Pepsi" (as in 1 to 3 liters a day) all have bone issues
[06:21:18] <amigojapan> Fenderbassist: does seltzer have phosphorus?
[06:21:26] <Fenderbassist> I don't think so
[06:21:29] <Fenderbassist> nor club soda
[06:21:34] <amigojapan> Ah good
[06:21:39] <Fenderbassist> I think it's in the syrup used for colas
[06:21:44] <Fenderbassist> Coke, Pepsi, etc.
[06:21:50] <amigojapan> I see
[06:39:26] <amigojapan> Fenderbassist: I would also like to go to a chiropractor. Unfortunately that is not covered in medical insurance in Japan
[06:40:25] <amigojapan> Fenderbassist: my dad also had back problems and he did not drink soda
[06:40:44] <Fenderbassist> yeah it can be genetic, as in my case
[06:40:57] <amigojapan> Ah ok
[06:41:00] <Fenderbassist> diet is just a small way to cope with it
[06:41:08] <Fenderbassist> to try to get more 'mileage' out of the thing lol
[06:41:17] <amigojapan> Gotcha
[06:41:22] <Fenderbassist> I see a chiropractor and it's been helpful too
[06:41:25] <Fenderbassist> sorry you can't
[06:41:30] <Fenderbassist> but maybe there is something else
[06:41:33] <Fenderbassist> yoga?
[06:41:51] <Fenderbassist> accupuncture maybe, I'm making guesses here
[06:42:06] <Fenderbassist> (needles to help with the pain part of the condition)
[06:42:38] <amigojapan> Fenderbassist: there is something called seikotsuin. Which is literally bone doctor which is covered by insurance I guess. But they don't crack bones
[06:43:06] <amigojapan> I have not gone yet
[06:44:35] <amigojapan> Fenderbassist: my meditation lessons include like an hour of yoga
[06:44:43] <Fenderbassist> so they don't manipulate bones for positioning...but might give you some insight
[06:44:50] <Fenderbassist> that's cool, I hope the yoga, done safely, can help

[07:08:27] <Fenderbassist> I like to be able to sleep at night knowing I don't have to deal with gangs taking out homes routinely in my neighborhood
[07:08:36] <amigojapan> I don't want to need to defend myself against an armed criminal
[07:08:38] <Fenderbassist> and I prep for the possibility it might happen
[07:08:42] <ButterNoodle> they have a job to do, and an appearance to keep up.. but the only one responsible for ur safety ultimately is urself
[07:08:53] <Fenderbassist> agreed, people need to take responsibility
[07:09:04] <ButterNoodle> amigojapan then lay down and die..
[07:09:05] <Fenderbassist> but with no police force at all, you have a much larger problem
[07:09:17] <Fenderbassist> because gangs take over towns
[07:09:22] <ButterNoodle> anyone that threatens ur life over an iphone doesnt value human life
[07:09:26] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: I have not had to ever
[07:09:42] <ButterNoodle> you wont in japan unless u spit on yakuza
[07:10:33] <ButterNoodle> japan is probably a great place for pacifists tbh.. murder rate is low..
[07:11:16] <ButterNoodle> probably more petty crime than anything
[07:12:09] <Fenderbassist> amigojapan: defending yourself isn't fun, but it beats the alternative
[07:12:15] <Fenderbassist> like, I never want to do it ever
[07:12:17] <Fenderbassist> but I'm ready to
[07:12:20] <amigojapan> If they allowed guns in Japan like they do in the US, not only would regular people get arms, so would criminals
[07:12:33] <Fenderbassist> criminals never had a problem getting black market guns ever
[07:12:43] <ButterNoodle> yea Fenderbassist its not the cops fault that things are shit.. bad cops, bad prosecutors, bad sentences, bad justice system.. good cops have a hard time keeping their head above water and maintaining a good relationship w the public
[07:12:43] <Fenderbassist> it's only the law abiding citizens that the laws prevent
[07:12:47] <amigojapan> They do here

[07:13:19] <Fenderbassist> amigojapan: I'm pretty sure criminals there can get their hands on weapons

[07:15:27] <amigojapan> Fenderbassist: monsters rarely bother normal folk unless they get involved

[07:44:08] <Fenderbassist> I've only learned from people like you or animes I've watched like Black Lagoon, etc.
[07:44:45] <amigojapan> Fenderbassist: it represents living a slim but long life
[07:44:56] <Fenderbassist> neat
[07:45:36] <Fenderbassist> fascinating culture
[07:48:29] <amigojapan> Fenderbassist: tho but sure why the Japanese elected to celebrate their new year first during the Chinese calendar over the Japanese one, and now the Gregorian one. Jews never had a problem keeping two calendars going
[07:48:59] <Fenderbassist> I really couldn't tell you, they never consulted with me, I guess I was busy with the Bronze Age at the time :p

[07:55:14] <amigojapan> Fenderbassist: rock bands have such outrageous names
[07:55:41] <Fenderbassist> was the idea, they were punk
[07:55:44] <Fenderbassist> that is the original lineup
[07:55:57] <Fenderbassist> Glen Matlock who did all the bass lines on the albums
[07:56:03] <Fenderbassist> is playing bass there on Letterman
[07:56:42] <Fenderbassist> he did the early gigs, then the band sacked him and got Sid Vicious to sort of play bass until he died from a heroin overdose
[07:56:56] <Fenderbassist> years later, they reunited and that's one video of them
[07:58:34] <Fenderbassist> the Sex Pistols made one album and changed music for a while
[07:58:55] <Fenderbassist> punk was short lived on mainstream
[07:59:12] <amigojapan> Fenderbassist: where is Sid vicious buried?
[07:59:26] <Fenderbassist> I have no idea, I assume somewhere in England
[07:59:32] <Fenderbassist> they were an English band
[08:00:18] <Fenderbassist> dunno if he was buried or creamated
[08:00:24] <Fenderbassist> cremated*
[08:00:26] <amigojapan> Fenderbassist: natsuki went to England looking for his grave and they told him he was buried in America. But not where
[08:01:04] <Fenderbassist> his name was John Simon Ritchie
[08:01:15] <Fenderbassist> he was cremated
[08:01:29] <Fenderbassist> scattered ashes apparently in Philadelphia
[08:01:30] <amigojapan> I see
[08:01:37] <amigojapan> Ah
[08:01:37] <Fenderbassist> on gf's grave

[08:11:48] <SummerSkies> the ht6
[08:11:51] <Fenderbassist> gotcha
[08:12:28] <SummerSkies> with low notes I just look for a good texture with distortion
[08:12:38] <Fenderbassist> looks well made
[08:12:40] <SummerSkies> with high notes I chase this certain sound in tone I can't describe it

[08:13:26] <Fenderbassist> I play P basses with Vintage style pickups/electronics through Fender Rumble gen 3 amps

[08:14:34] <Fenderbassist> save those pennies or buy on credit and pay off
[08:14:42] <SummerSkies> i got a better idea
[08:14:55] <Fenderbassist> I bought two basses on credit, no interest, paying $70 a month
[08:15:05] <SummerSkies> find the exact combined strength of the entire team of guys that's working in a store that sells one
[08:15:14] <SummerSkies> and train day and night to be able to match that strength for the final battle
[08:15:18] <Fenderbassist> rofl
[08:15:24] <Fenderbassist> the police will win in the end
[08:15:29] <SummerSkies> and after besting them in the final match, I will leave with my guitar
[08:15:30] <Fenderbassist> you're better off paying for it
[08:15:38] <Fenderbassist> :D
[08:15:47] <Fenderbassist> stay on the right side of the law
[08:15:52] <Fenderbassist> it's worth it
[08:15:56] <SummerSkies> yes thank you
[08:15:59] <Fenderbassist> lol
[08:16:01] <SummerSkies> stores shouldn't keep guitars from people who deserve them
[08:16:21] <Fenderbassist> then they would have to not pay store workers who deserve a paycheck
[08:16:29] <Fenderbassist> I used to be one
[08:16:51] <amigojapan> Fenderbassist: can you link the David Bowie sing again please? It's way up and tomako woke up
[08:16:52] <Fenderbassist> and they would not have to pay distributors

[09:07:12] <Fenderbassist> I do a multi, it gives you a nice base
[09:07:33] <Fenderbassist> I also take 5000 IU soft gell to get me to about 5500 IU's

[09:12:39] <Fenderbassist> I would recommend you see your doctor and have them do a bloodtest to measure your D level, I did

[09:34:03] <Fenderbassist> electric bass and drum parts are very tied together, especially the kick drum and the bass being synchronized

[09:48:54] <Fenderbassist> so was kind of a clique between them all
[09:49:18] <Fenderbassist> Let's Active name taken from a Japanese t shirt of the time
[09:57:16] <Fenderbassist> I just like music from that era, this example of The Smiths guitar and bass from their first hit is in my opinion impressive for someone 19 years old and possible self taught (never confirmed that)

[09:58:31] <Fenderbassist> it's not "blow your mind" complex like Dream Theater but I like it
[09:59:10] <Fenderbassist> and it was a counterpoint to all the synth stuff going on at the time

[11:02:29] <amigojapan> Right it was great
[11:15:16] <jessedesu_onaph> I wonder if my vba macro works in libreoffice calc
[11:15:36] <jessedesu_onaph> It's mostly the function sendkeys()
[11:16:56] <Fenderbassist> I have no idea, I hope so
[11:17:03] <Fenderbassist> you guys are way way way more technical than I
[11:17:06] <jessedesu_onaph> It's a good macro
[11:17:11] <jessedesu_onaph> My first edit
[11:17:15] <jessedesu_onaph> That works
[11:17:19] <Fenderbassist> I'm a bass player, I count to 4 and repeat :p
[11:17:33] <Fenderbassist> that's my technical limit :)

[11:17:43] <jessedesu_onaph> Or gypsy
[11:17:56] <jessedesu_onaph> Or what's it called
[11:17:59] <Fenderbassist> well yeah it's similar to Latin, there's a lot of root and 5th
[11:18:07] <jessedesu_onaph> 4/3 beat music
[11:18:10] <Fenderbassist> the guitar players are doing all the heavy work
[11:18:15] <Fenderbassist> the bass and drums hold a pattern
[11:18:17] <Fenderbassist> like with most things
[11:18:19] <Fenderbassist> country too
[11:18:32] <Fenderbassist> lots of root and 5th in country
[11:18:41] <jessedesu_onaph> Is it 4/3 or 3/4
[11:18:47] <Fenderbassist> 3/4 is waltz time
[11:18:56] <Fenderbassist> I am not familiar with 4/3 as a time signature
[11:18:57] <jessedesu_onaph> Ah yes
[11:19:13] <Fenderbassist> but then again I'm not conservatory trained, just music store trained
[11:19:38] <jessedesu_onaph> I have art training
[11:19:44] <jessedesu_onaph> Can't say I'm good

[11:31:08] <Fenderbassist> nice
[11:31:56] <PancakeMatsuri> if you have anxiety, they might work wonders for you

[11:33:48] <PancakeMatsuri> oh, did I do anything?
[11:33:48] <Fenderbassist> for me the only anxiety I have is if I can't breathe, because I was an asthmatic baby so it was one of the first fears I learned
[11:34:11] <Fenderbassist> if I control my breathing to slow down my heart, it goes away, but I will keep nootropics in mind
[11:34:33] <PancakeMatsuri> I see, you don't have that much anxiety. I didn't realise my baseline anxiety was very high.

[11:37:41] <Fenderbassist> music keeps you young, as does vitamins....I think....
[11:39:22] <Bco1981> yes to the music.
[11:39:46] <Bco1981> have been on vitamins for the last couple of months. can't feel any difference.
[11:40:00] <Fenderbassist> natural or synthetic?
[11:40:23] <Fenderbassist> ex - Natures Way Alive! brand natural, Centrum synthetic
[11:40:25] <Bco1981> pill form, i guess synthetic
[11:40:39] <Fenderbassist> well most are pill or capsule or liquid form
[11:40:48] <Fenderbassist> can be natural or synthetic
[11:40:51] <ImoutoBot> New episode for: Obey Me! | Episode: 12
[11:40:57] <Fenderbassist> one way to tell is by the vitamin E content
[11:41:27] <Fenderbassist> d-alpha tocopherol is natural (made from soybeans I think), dl-alpha tocopherol is synthetic (made from coal tar I think)
[11:41:33] <Bco1981> 12mg
[11:42:30] <Fenderbassist> synthetic far cheaper, so you can also tell by price
[11:42:39] <Fenderbassist> common in budget formulas
[11:43:02] <Fenderbassist> we took Centrum for years growing up, never could tell a difference tbh
[11:43:21] <Fenderbassist> later in life I switched to Solgar, Twin Labs, Nature's Way, etc.
[11:44:21] <Fenderbassist> good health food store brands
[11:45:30] <Fenderbassist> even as a fossil, I can feel a bit better with the natural ones, only took me decades to start using them lol
[11:46:51] <Fenderbassist> <---- healthy fossil
[11:46:55] <Fenderbassist> somewhat
[11:49:53] <amigojapan> Fenderbassist: having yakitori now
[11:50:06] <Fenderbassist> amigojapan: what is yakitori please?
[11:50:36] <amigojapan> Fenderbassist: just chiken in a skewer
[11:50:40] <Fenderbassist> ah ok
[11:50:45] <Fenderbassist> I had chicken earlier
[11:50:52] <Fenderbassist> chicken and broccoli a fav of mine
[11:50:56] <amigojapan> Fenderbassist: mine has Gallic too
[11:51:07] <Fenderbassist> garlic for flavoring the oil?
[11:51:30] <amigojapan> Like cloves of garlic
[11:51:36] <Fenderbassist> I cook mine in light layer of olive oil, sometimes I flavor the oil with garlic or onions
[11:51:39] <Fenderbassist> yes
[11:51:41] <Fenderbassist> cool
[11:52:15] <Fenderbassist> then salt and pepper and you're golden
[11:53:02] <amigojapan> Pretty much the same thing in a different form factor
[11:53:09] <Fenderbassist> indeed
[11:53:29] <Fenderbassist> chicken a good source of BCAAs (Branched Chain Amino Acids)
[11:53:40] <Fenderbassist> necessary to get through the diet
[11:53:42] <amigojapan> Fenderbassist: you can choose to have them covered in teriyaki sauce. But tomako does not like that
[11:53:59] <Fenderbassist> I skip sauces, too many calories I don't need as a fossil
[11:54:12] <Fenderbassist> spices are very few calories
[11:54:38] <Fenderbassist> but I want the protein
[11:54:51] <Fenderbassist> and some healthy complex carbs and fiber
[11:54:56] <amigojapan> Fenderbassist: have you met omero here yet? He also refers to himself as a "living fossil
[11:54:58] <Fenderbassist> thus broccoli, or lima beans
[11:55:07] <Fenderbassist> we may have said hello
[11:55:17] <Fenderbassist> we'll have to compare our fossilages
[11:55:37] <Fenderbassist> see how many superfoods we have in common
[11:55:43] <amigojapan> I don't think he likes to say his actual age tho
[11:55:47] <Fenderbassist> is fine
[11:55:54] <Fenderbassist> I'll give mine and take his word for his
[11:56:11] <Fenderbassist> am fine with coming in 2nd place lol
[11:57:20] <amigojapan> Fenderbassist: asking people what their first anime was can give us a good idea of age
[11:57:42] <Fenderbassist> as a tot I saw the original Speed Racer in English on American TV
[11:58:01] <Fenderbassist> as a teen I saw G Force and Battleship Yamato also in English
[11:58:13] <Fenderbassist> when I finally got a PC and Internet service I went fully subs
[11:58:31] <amigojapan> omero: loves yamato
[11:58:49] <Fenderbassist> haven't seen it in ages, saw the live action version a few years ago
[11:59:02] <amigojapan> Ah we did too
[11:59:20] <amigojapan> Was that that terrible?
[11:59:23] <Fenderbassist> no
[11:59:26] <Fenderbassist> it was ok
[11:59:30] <Fenderbassist> they did a decent job
[11:59:34] <Fenderbassist> wasn't like the series
[11:59:47] <amigojapan> Ah good to know. An acceptable live action
[11:59:58] <Fenderbassist> kinda like Initial D, I much prefer the anime to the live action but the live action was ok
[12:00:16] <Fenderbassist> I didn't bother with the Dragonball live action ones
[12:00:26] <Fenderbassist> heard they were a disappointment so skipped them
[12:00:49] <amigojapan> I have only played the arcade game for initial D and it is fantastic
[12:01:03] <Fenderbassist> I really enjoyed the series
[12:01:12] <Fenderbassist> felt it was very well done, even with the silly moments
[12:01:34] <Fenderbassist> I raced cars in my 20s so I had that commonality
[12:01:41] <amigojapan> I will eventually watch that
[12:02:02] <Fenderbassist> it's basically "ninja training" for a mountain racer
[12:02:05] <mixfix41> journey to the west is a good foreign flick
[12:02:10] <amigojapan> Fenderbassist: was that like in rebel without a cause?
[12:02:28] <amigojapan> mixfix41: read the book
[12:02:50] <mixfix41> im kinda stuck at reading at the moment tbh
[12:02:58] <Fenderbassist> mixfix41: cool haven't seen it
[12:03:00] <mixfix41> i have paperback books that im intending to finish
[12:03:06] <mixfix41> scifi
[12:03:16] <Fenderbassist> amigojapan: I think Rebel Without A Cause was a bit different
[12:03:20] <Fenderbassist> but still a classic
[12:03:23] <Fenderbassist> James Dean
[12:03:35] <amigojapan> Fenderbassist: it's the story that dragon Ball uses for its basis
[12:03:49] <Fenderbassist> Initial D is about a racer who was trained by his father without his knowledge as a car driver
[12:03:58] <amigojapan> Fenderbassist: I mean the car racing you did
[12:04:03] <Fenderbassist> I watched it 3x and will rewatch it again
[12:04:14] <Fenderbassist> oh no that was about growing up with friends that liked muscle cars
[12:04:35] <Fenderbassist> I had a 67 GTO with a 400 and a dual gate shifter, posi traction rear
[12:04:56] <Fenderbassist> my friends had a 64 1/2 Mustang with a 289, a Fairlane with a 351 I think
[12:05:03] <Fenderbassist> and other muscle cars from the 60s
[12:05:36] <Fenderbassist> we drove like retards on back streets at night comparing cars lol
[12:05:39] <Fenderbassist> :)
[12:05:42] <Fenderbassist> being 17
[12:05:44] <Fenderbassist> such is life
[12:06:17] <Fenderbassist> young and invincible and lucky we didn't crash
[12:06:35] <amigojapan> I see. I did my share of danger in cars. Maybe that's why I am cursed never too drive again
[12:06:53] <Fenderbassist> well you can get by without driving, saves you a ton of money
[12:07:00] <amigojapan> Yup
[12:07:10] <Fenderbassist> I remember doing 130 MPH in my GTO on a highway at 3 in the morning

[12:49:30] <emmeka> zoidberg Horriblesubs didn't actually fansub. They just ripped official services.
[12:49:45] <emmeka> it's Sentai Filmworks' subs that say "meowning"
[12:50:00] <_chroot> My free time is 24/7.
[12:50:05] <zoidberg> I see. 
[12:50:38] <emmeka> Non Non Biyori is like peak slice of life anime, and it's fantastic, you should definitely watch it
[12:50:55] <zoidberg> they said, they will
[12:51:09] <emmeka> speaking of Sentai Filmworks, I'm trying to decide if I want to pay for Hidive, because they have a 50% off annual subscription that ends tonight
[12:51:28] <zoidberg> what's hidive?
[12:52:24] <emmeka> Sentai Filmworks' streaming service. They put their whole catalogue up there. At the moment, they're the only actual competitor to like, Funimation/Crunchyroll, or Netflix. They also rescued all the shit from the jail cell that was Anime Strike on Amazon Prime.
[12:52:41] <_chroot> Please, suggest site for watching anime without non-free javascript.
[12:52:50] <emmeka> _chroot no.
[12:53:17] <_chroot> Sad.
[12:53:21] <emmeka> _chroot linking to pirated content is against Libera policy, nobody will do it for you here.
[12:53:38] <zoidberg> we can't suggest any unofficial or illegal ways to stream anime here and please don't ask either
[12:53:43] <emmeka> find it yourself (but really, don't use streaming sites at all, at least torrent the shit properly)
[12:54:09] <_chroot> I'm not talking about the price.
[12:54:37] <darkwitch> if they break the libera policy, they will suffer for all eternity
[12:55:03] <zoidberg> yes, hell awaits
[12:55:37] <zoidberg> is there something about piracy in Dante's Inferno?
[12:55:41] <darkwitch> you can shorten eternity by finding something better to do than suffering
[12:55:46] <emmeka> zoidberg Hidive is gonna get the new season of Takagi-san, at least. And part of me thinks "good on you for preventing a monopoly, Sentai Filmworks. Here, have $2 a month as anti-monopoly insurance"
[12:56:30] <zoidberg> woah, I like Takagi San. 
[12:57:02] <_chroot> I condemn piracy, I was talking about software freedom.
[12:57:32] <darkwitch> you have no freedom when it comes to things like that
[12:57:35] <zoidberg> ah, I see. So you don't like JS, not much of a surprise there though.
[12:57:55] <_chroot> Yeah.
[12:58:06] <zoidberg> unfortunately I don't think there are any free from clutches of JS

[14:29:34] <amigojapan> 乾杯!
[14:29:56] <darkwitch> yeah, non-alcoholic coffee
[14:30:13] <Sadale> zoidberg, Maybe try selling them to Chinese. Chinese people love to buy lands and apartments.
[14:30:16] <zoidberg> Sadale: btw when people buy properties here, they don't buy it for market price officially, they buy it for government value/price which is lot lot lower than market price
[14:30:47] <zoidberg> Sadale: that way people escape from paying taxes
[14:30:50] <Sadale> zoidberg, oh. What'd qualify you to buy them from the government? Wouldn't everyone be purchasing the land from the governmetn then>?
[14:32:03] <amigojapan> darkwitch: we will count the caffeine
[14:32:05] <zoidberg> Sadale: It's not the government land. Every area here has government price which is like what government values of the land in the area.
[14:32:27] <Sadale> zoidberg, oh. Now that I get what you mean

[14:50:02] <Bco1981> Sadale: women and booze.
[14:50:04] <KatrinValerie> Also usually if you already have money, people are more likely to give you more
[14:50:12] <zoidberg> it's not much of an issue Sadale but the government knows our taxes, all governments do
[14:50:12] <KatrinValerie> proven effect
[14:50:31] <KatrinValerie> People show more solidarity with those that have something already
[14:50:32] <Bco1981> i guess that goes under luxury.
[14:50:39] <zoidberg> it's a shitty world where we're asked to do taxes
[14:50:51] <KatrinValerie> Poor people are often regarded poorly here
[14:51:20] <KatrinValerie> Because our society highly individualises success and failure is pinned entirely to the individual itself.
[14:52:25] <KatrinValerie> zoidberg: if you are fed up with taxes just do a coup
[14:52:26] <zoidberg> KatrinValerie: They kind of, yes. We're still developing nation. The government policies are centre-right or center-left. Not purely capitalist market, there are social, welfare schemes, a lot of them
[14:52:34] <Sadale> zoidberg, I find it funny how many people here don't take tax seriously
[14:52:47] <Sadale> AFAIK tax evasion isn't uncommon here.
[14:53:01] <Sadale> Especially at individual level or at small scale businesses
[14:53:06] <zoidberg> yeah, same here Sadale
[14:53:14] <KatrinValerie> zoidberg: welfare schemes often create dependence and they can be used as a pressureing tool as well.
[14:53:20] <Sadale> Apparently those western people take tax far more seriously, like davic
[14:53:37] <KatrinValerie> When you are dependent on welfare money, the threat of that money being withdrawn is very very dreadful
[14:53:46] <zoidberg> KatrinValerie: it's mostly for votes than helping poor
[14:54:00] <KatrinValerie> Here it is mostly used to push you into minimum wage jobs that have increadibly high turnovers
[14:54:49] <KatrinValerie> We will see what the new gov will do about it, a reform of our welfare system is planned
[14:54:51] <zoidberg> well yeah, no one wants a smart one who can figure out how badly they're getting screwed

[14:58:05] <Sadale> zoidberg, oh
[14:58:40] <zoidberg> Sadale: and also if one hasn't paid, the government kind of lenient saying just pay, they won't ask any question, no jails, cases..
[14:59:11] <KatrinValerie> meow
[14:59:29] <KatrinValerie> I am tired already
[14:59:42] <zoidberg> Sadale: so if someone hasn't paid any taxes till now, they could directly pay taxes for last three years and be completely legal in government sense with good credit score and what not

[15:05:52] <Sadale> zoidberg, I think not paying tax won't affect your benefits here. Technically you'd have to pay back the tax with a high punishment interest rate. In practice tho, AFAIK, the IRS here's rather lenient. I've heard others saying that there's no interest rate or they just waive the tax that you haven't paid if you aren't able to pay for them.
[15:06:07] <amigojapan> KatrinValerie: I mean even in this economy, before UBI welfare is nessesary for certain people
[15:06:48] <Sadale> zoidberg, so once you get caught, the best case scenario is that they'd waive your old tax and you'd have to pay for the tax since the time you get caught.
[15:07:13] <Sadale> As if we get any decent benefits thru tax here tho! xD
[15:07:32] <Sadale> stupid landprice. Better-than-nothing medical welfare. :/
[15:07:38] <zoidberg> Sadale: It used to be like that here too but they realized if they want taxes, they have to lax the norms a bit. They did and surprisingly it works.
[15:08:19] <Sadale> zoidberg, lolololol
[15:08:21] <zoidberg> Sadale: the government here has collected more taxes than before because of slightly relaxed norms
[15:08:33] <Sadale> That's funny
[15:09:30] <NewLondon> what's UBI?
[15:09:51] <amigojapan> NewLondon: universal basic income
[15:10:02] <NewLondon> ah
[15:10:46] <zoidberg> I mean think about it. Penalities, fines, legal issues and all that rot. People would get plainly scared by all this even if they want to pay taxes, Sadale. People need IT filing/taxes for lot of things. They can't get any sort of loan if they don't pay taxes.
[15:11:18] <Sadale> true.
[15:11:22] <zoidberg> and these days everyone owns a car and most of them will buy a flat/apartment in their life
[15:11:25] <amigojapan> KatrinValerie: for a UBI I think what's most important is that it is always adjusted for inflation and also that it is enough to live a basic life
[15:11:29] <Sadale> Same here. tax filling is used for getting loan
[15:11:38] <zoidberg> so they all need to show their income

[15:56:36] <amigojapan> darkwitch: you don't need holidays in my calendar cause you actually get enough time off
[15:59:56] <amigojapan> darkwitch: 2 days every 7 days is way too few. Plus a few holidays. Is basically slavery
[16:00:55] <amigojapan> It should be 50% work days and 50% rest days

[17:19:04] <Satin> how so
[17:19:07] <darkwitch> the only real reason for satanism to exist seems to be because some people want to be anti-christian and not because they care about satan

[17:27:05] <MootPoot> pretty straightforward - people dont change or listen or accomodate you by you whacking them 
[17:27:18] <MootPoot> if anything they move further away almost all the time
[17:28:02] <darkwitch> you can't force people to change what they believe
[17:28:04] <MootPoot> would be more entertaining to see you pretend to be a christian who started to become liberal / athiest slowly in the server

[18:27:16] <JesseDesu2> are those digital cameras ezekielnoob 
[18:27:20] <Ooga> I do like the older Olympus PEN series.

[18:28:46] <Ooga> Cheeky Ooga not paying for things again oops.
[18:28:46] <ezekielnoob> JesseDesu2 i always go with basic corrections first, like exposure / contrast
[18:28:49] *** Quits: amigojapan (uid86330@id-86330.helmsley.irccloud.com) ()
[18:28:56] <ezekielnoob> i kinda edit in a weird way, i always set the contrast to -100
[18:29:05] <JesseDesu2> then what
[18:29:06] <ezekielnoob> Then i dictate the contrast back using tone curve
[18:29:13] <Ooga> Dick-tate.
[18:29:18] <Ooga> You're funny.
[18:29:41] <ezekielnoob> but that's my color style... wherein the 'outlines' or blacks are really blacks and everything else is low contrast
[18:29:49] <basuotoko> Guys, happy new year.
[18:29:50] <Ooga> Not a fan of messing around with saturation.
[18:29:52] <ezekielnoob> and i boost the primaary saturation
[18:30:02] <ezekielnoob> actually instead of saturation u can boost the primaries
[18:30:05] <darkwitch> japan is now in 2022, if you believe in it

[18:31:20] <Ooga> Putting film in is a bitch.
[18:31:21] <JesseDesu2> i'm using raw therapee which is different
[18:31:26] <ezekielnoob> yes so instead of me cranking the 'main saturation' up, i crank the Blue saturation instead
[18:31:30] <JesseDesu2> but meant to simulate light room
[18:31:30] <Ooga> But good results from taking photos makes me happy.
[18:32:45] <JesseDesu2> i'm using a 50mm macro lens on a canon M50 with the smallest aperature (22)
[18:33:07] <JesseDesu2> hand held shots have to be 1/60 second or quicker
[18:33:30] <JesseDesu2> and iso preferrably on auto or the lowest it can go with the above combination
[18:33:34] <ezekielnoob> wait  that's how you process your film?
[18:35:03] <JesseDesu2> i also like the manual focus with edge indicators highlighted
[18:35:09] <JesseDesu2> SO MUCH control
[18:35:38] <JesseDesu2> my galaxy S21+ has it even
[18:35:42] <ezekielnoob> man... i went to a convention yesterday, i miss that thing so much
[18:35:43] <JesseDesu2> under pro mode
[18:35:45] <ezekielnoob> it's been 2 years
[18:37:00] <Ooga> I have difficulty taking photographs indoor and at night.
[18:37:07] <JesseDesu2> i almost went into a photography major but decided on illustration
[18:37:21] <Ooga> Its easy for me to use the aperature mode and shutter speed out in daylight.
[18:38:06] <JesseDesu2> 1/50 or 1/60 is the general rule for a steady shot
[18:38:21] <Ooga> Good for portraits no?
[18:38:22] <JesseDesu2> maybe 1/30 if you hold your breath like a sniper
[18:38:36] <Ooga> What about for zoo animals or dogs?
[18:38:42] <Ooga> 1/125 or more?
[18:38:47] <ezekielnoob> it depends :)
[18:38:56] <JesseDesu2> the speed depends on the speed of the subject
[18:38:58] * Surreal 1 mug filled half with Stroh rum, half with chocolademilk, whipped cream on top with a spoon, as a finishing touch
[18:39:06] <ezekielnoob> 1/125 seems good for medium speed things
[18:39:33] <JesseDesu2> if you want to capture a guitarist playing in a dark venue, 1/60 is not enough to completely freeze their moving arm
[18:39:54] <Ooga> Dark settings are difficult for me in photography.
[18:40:06] <JesseDesu2> well theres always flash
[18:40:07] <JesseDesu2> lol
[18:40:07] <Ooga> Because I get thrown out of the equation on what exposure settings to use.
[18:40:31] <Ooga> JesseDesu2: Do you have sigma lenses any chance?
[18:40:52] <JesseDesu2> largest aperature lens you can afford, highest iso you can get
[18:40:59] <JesseDesu2> nah i have genuine canon lenses
[18:41:11] <Ooga> EF?
[18:41:21] <JesseDesu2> get a 1.4 lens with image stabilizer if you want night shots
[18:41:21] <Ooga> EF-M is the mirrorless version I think.
[18:41:29] <JesseDesu2> yea i have mirrorless
[18:41:36] <Ooga> Would a 2.8 still suffice. JesseDesu2
[18:41:38] <ezekielnoob> they are good lenses
[18:41:44] <ezekielnoob> those Sigma 1.4 primes are really good
[18:41:46] <JesseDesu2> i made the mistake of blowing dust off the lens
[18:41:51] <JesseDesu2> accidentally spat on it
[18:41:53] <JesseDesu2> LOL
[18:42:00] <Ooga> Good god.
[18:42:03] <JesseDesu2> yea
[18:42:15] <JesseDesu2> you're supposed to use a rubber squeeze blower
[18:42:32] <Ooga> Cleaning tools.
[18:42:33] <JesseDesu2> aerosol can air might leave residue
[18:42:54] <JesseDesu2> i dunno
[18:42:55] <Ooga> I remember one of me mates had a pricy fujifilm in his hands.
[18:43:01] <JesseDesu2> i'm sure sigma might be good
[18:43:06] <Ooga> Said one of his tamron lenses had fungi?
[18:43:07] <JesseDesu2> 1.4 is pricey
[18:43:13] <JesseDesu2> 1.2 even pricier
[18:43:16] <JesseDesu2> if theres such a thing
[18:43:30] <ezekielnoob> i used to have a Tamron macro lens for canon
[18:43:38] <ezekielnoob> now i just use M43 system and their 42.5mm

[18:48:31] <JesseDesu2> what kind
[18:48:32] <ezekielnoob> good light + cam phone
[18:48:49] <ezekielnoob> i suppose it's not the 'kind' of light but rather how you use it
[18:48:54] <ezekielnoob> it can be a bulb
[18:48:57] <ezekielnoob> or a speedlite
[18:49:01] <JesseDesu2> i have shitty flourcesent bulb substitutes for incandecent holders
[18:49:02] <ezekielnoob> or an LED panel
[18:49:04] <Ooga> What about the sun.
[18:49:15] <ezekielnoob> yeah i think you can invest with good lighting + backdrop for cleaner shots
[18:49:21] <ezekielnoob> that's not gonna cost a lot of money
[18:49:35] <Ooga> Isnt the backdrop like a background for the subject.
[18:49:41] <ezekielnoob> those look good, are those battery powered?

[18:56:53] <MootPoot> its never been in a fight
[18:56:55] <JesseDesu2> not in actual combat
[18:57:03] <MootPoot> afaik same thing with the f-35
[18:57:03] <JesseDesu2> its been used over syria
[18:57:04] <SummerSkies> too modern I would assume 
[18:57:19] <JesseDesu2> only air to ground missions tho
[18:57:19] <SummerSkies> honestly now that I think about it, it's a good thing they've never been used 
[18:57:20] <ezekielnoob> we really don't want a modern warfare
[18:57:25] <SummerSkies> ezekielnoob: exactly
[18:57:27] <MootPoot> why bother - f22 is trash for air to ground
[18:57:33] <JesseDesu2> back to photo talk
[18:57:33] <SummerSkies> dude how
[18:57:35] <MootPoot> its not a multirole
[18:57:49] <SummerSkies> yeah but it can do so much other stuff besides just that
[18:58:03] <MootPoot> not really - f22 is a pure air to air fighter 
[18:58:06] <JesseDesu2> the only thing that can shoot an F-22 is a camera
[18:58:12] <MootPoot> are you sure you're not talking about a f35
[18:58:26] <ezekielnoob> i don't mind talking about tanks and planesi nstead :p
[18:58:32] <SummerSkies> the F35 was meant to replace the F22 I heard somewhere so I know that they are comparable
[18:58:33] <JesseDesu2> shoot an F-22 with F22
[18:58:37] <SummerSkies> with the F35 possibly having the edge
[18:58:48] <Roey> well now they'r emaking their own fioghter to replace the f22
[18:58:52] <Roey> and it isn't the f35
[18:58:56] <MootPoot> technically it can but like, why bother when there are other ground attack aircraft 
[18:58:58] <SummerSkies> but the F22, described by any military personell who knows a damn about it, is a beast
[18:58:59] <Roey> tlaking about airforce here
[18:59:08] <MootPoot> well, the f35 isen't a f22 replacement in the true sense
[18:59:08] <JesseDesu2> F-35 has the radar cross section of a golfball, the F-22 is a marble
[18:59:09] <SummerSkies> personnel
[18:59:19] <SummerSkies> yeah that looks more right
[18:59:21] <MootPoot> the f35 is a true multirole - f22 is a air to air mainly
[18:59:35] <MootPoot> so f35 was supposed to replace everything else including the f22
[18:59:41] <MootPoot> except...it didint
[18:59:42] <SummerSkies> I see
[18:59:45] <JesseDesu2> also, the F-22 and F-35 for the longest time could not communicate to each other in the same format

[19:00:34] <JesseDesu2> F-22 has a slight edge on F-35 using pure stealth, but the F-35 has more jamming power
[19:00:55] <JesseDesu2> and the Su-57 has whats called "Pac Man" stealth
[19:01:29] <JesseDesu2> its engines arent stealth, so it has a stealth signature that looks like pac man

[19:02:28] <Roey> <JesseDesu2> its engines arent stealth, so it has a stealth signature that looks like pac man <- oh I thought it's because when it sees enemy fighters, it has to run and hide
[19:02:34] <JesseDesu2> F-35 engines are the most expensive but most powerful powerplants weight for thrust
[19:02:54] <JesseDesu2> hah roey maybe
[19:03:11] <JesseDesu2> mootpoot i dont play games anymre
[19:03:21] <MootPoot> well, get back into it
[19:03:22] <Roey> I wonder if we can make ion thrusters as powerful as jet engines
[19:03:31] <JesseDesu2> i had like over a dozen flight sims back in 1997-2003
[19:03:34] <Roey> and then replace helicopter and jet engine propulsion with ion thrusters.

[21:10:54] <JesseDesu2> whats a die grinder
[21:10:58] <JesseDesu2> sounds unpleasant
[21:11:03] <emmeka> a tool that grinds dies
[21:11:19] <JesseDesu2> whats dies in a grinding context
[21:11:26] <JesseDesu2> as an artist i know dies are colors
[21:11:37] <emmeka> dies are molds you use for casting things
[21:11:54] <JesseDesu2> i thought they just call those molds
[21:12:23] <emmeka> but in practice, a dremel is a tool you use when you want make any sort of small detailed cut into steel
[21:12:55] <JesseDesu2> resin molds dont last forever, they have to recast the masters every once in a while
[21:13:04] <JesseDesu2> molds for resin rather
[21:13:10] <JesseDesu2> vulcanizing shit
[21:13:29] <emmeka> JesseDesu2 for some reason in the case of steel and relatively industrial shit, it is a die
[21:13:55] <JesseDesu2> i have a dremel my dad gave me when i was 13
[21:13:57] <JesseDesu2> still works
[21:14:05] <MootPoot> I ordered pizza
[21:14:07] <emmeka> one of those kinds of things.

[21:14:42] <JesseDesu2> i also bought a slow ass dremel type motor tool
[21:15:07] <JesseDesu2> the foam boxes i keep getting every 3 months for refridgerated eczema medicine
[21:15:22] <JesseDesu2> i wanna build a hutch for my desk
[21:15:42] <JesseDesu2> theres a nice slab of 3/4" wood in the garage someone left behind
[21:15:51] <emmeka> making furniture with a sawzall? sounds... unrefined.
[21:16:12] <JesseDesu2> sawzall sounds unrefined
[21:16:17] <JesseDesu2> i like reciprosaw
[21:16:37] <JesseDesu2> more letters but hey
[21:16:38] <emmeka> they don't really make nice straight cuts. They're useful when you need to get through something tough fast and it doesn't matter if it's pretty
