[00:02:59] <river> cuppajoeman, to find Pr[X = x] we counted how many ways you can do a + b = x and divided by 36
[00:03:11] <river> so the problem is to count the number of solutions to a + b = x
[00:03:16] <cuppajoeman> Yeah
[00:03:23] <cuppajoeman> DId you see what I wrote?

[00:03:49] <river> if a + b = x is a solution, b = x - a

[00:04:20] <river> like for Pr[X = 4], a can be 1,2, or 3
[00:04:32] <cuppajoeman> So I pretty much realized this is the same as the following question, let x in {2, ..., 12}, then we have to find the number of y 's of the set {1, ..., 6 } where x - y is in the range { 1, ..., 6}
[00:04:54] <river> oh that sounds like a good approach
[00:04:57] <cuppajoeman> So we need to find how many solutions there are for y as above where 1 <= x - y <= 6
[00:05:06] <river> maybe that was abs will come in

[03:26:20] <[itchyjunk]> because it's easier?
[03:26:29] <[itchyjunk]> can

[03:32:22] <johnkeats6> (it's really called the abel-ruffini theorem)
[03:34:43] <isekaijin> For example, from a Riemannian metric, you get a canonical volume pseudoform, and from a symplectic form, you also get a canonical volume form.
[03:35:06] <subdelusional> hello -- I need help understanding why rational multiplication and addition are different. I tried doing some equations and I've deduced that multiplication is the way it is because of division, but I can't wrap my head around why when you want to add two rationals, say, 0.2 and 0.3 you can't simply do a 0.3+0.3, even though 2*3 would be also 3+3 or 2+2+2
[03:36:22] <isekaijin> Remember that, say, 15.25 actually means 1*10^1 + 5*10^0 + 2*10^(-1) + 5*10^(-2).
[03:36:56] <isekaijin> So you need to add the digits that correspond to the same “place”, i.e., the same power of 10.

[07:13:30] <JimmyRustles> oh that makes sense
[07:13:37] <JimmyRustles> easy way to understand it
[07:13:59] <frelleck> after n moves you tend to be on order n^(1/2) units away
[07:14:10] <JimmyRustles> how did you work that out?
[07:14:20] <frelleck> it's called a random walk, it's basically a branch of math in itself
[07:14:25] <JimmyRustles> oh
[07:14:35] <Nickssen> never doubt frelleck
[07:14:44] <frelleck> stop grovelling
[07:14:48] <JimmyRustles> i'm making a space ship game and that's pretty much how my enemy movement works, i was hoping they'd tend towards their starting position so they don't fly too far awy from the action
[07:15:00] <somiaj> You can even simplify the problem, you have a random walk where you can only walk to integer grid points in R^2. So basically at each point in R^2, you have a 25% probablity to walk to the integer point in one of four directions (must follow grid lines)
[07:15:19] <frelleck> even in 1 dimension you tend to drift away
[07:15:22] <somiaj> In this case you can prove with a probablity of 1 that you will pass through any given point an infinte number of times.
[07:15:32] <frelleck> if you are on a line and you move to the right or left by one unit each time
[07:16:05] <somiaj> But if you extend this to R^3, you will with probability 1 pass through any given point only a finite number of times (though you will still loop around the origin and not drift to any particular direction)
[07:16:24] <JimmyRustles> it's amazing that this stuff can be worked out
[07:17:40] <frelleck> I wonder if it's related to the fact smoke tends to disperse
[07:17:49] <frelleck> do the smoke particles do a random walk

[09:44:20] <rubiksdream> normskal for now reducing your equation to aY = b (mod c) (then later taking a cube root of Y, if one exists), if you aren't in a situation where gcd(a,c) = 1, then writing c = p_1^{a_1}..p_k^{a_k} in prime factorization, and assuming p_1^{b_1}...p_s^{b_s} is gcd(a,c), you should first check if b is divisible by any prime dividing gcd(a,c), in which case your thing holds for literally all x, otherwise you need to solve aY = b (mod p) for every

[09:56:11] <rubiksdream> kobalt maybe the 'tricky' part about this problem is you may be used to just conditioning once, i.e. you ask what happens after assuming the first bit is either 0/1, assuming it is 0 what happens is easy to see, assuming it is 1 one needs to go one step further and condition again
[09:56:28] <rubiksdream> but after conditioning once more, it becomes easy to see again

[10:41:10] <rubiksdream> it is definitely solvable by the graph theory method, he's likely looking for some recurrence relation to solve the problem though
[10:41:21] <nagefire> Still, interesting application of graph theory to such a counting problem
[10:41:30] <rubiksdream> sure
[10:41:52] <kobalt> graph theory means the tree method?
[10:42:01] <nagefire> rubiksdream: you could get the recurrence from the adjacency
[10:42:04] *** Joins: mrdata_ (~mrdata@135-23-182-185.cpe.pppoe.ca)
[10:42:16] <nagefire> it's a function of the real part of roots of unity
[10:42:38] <rubiksdream> no, they are saying the problem is equivalent to finding the number of paths of length 9 on an undirected graph with 5 vertices
[10:42:48] <qergle> a recurrence solution is a_{n+1}=3a_{n-1} a_1=2, a_2=4, and the number youre after is a_10+2a_9
[10:42:49] <rubiksdream> which it quite literally is, because each such path corresponds to a sequence
[10:43:11] <nagefire> rubiksdream: exactly, thank you for providing such an elegant explanation
[10:44:51] <qergle> your {a_n} is: 2, 4, 6, 12, 18, 36, 54, 108, 162, 324, ...
[10:45:44] <rubiksdream> by 'adjacency matrix' they mean a 5x5 matrix with a '1' in the (i,j) entry if there is an edge from vertex i to vertex j (since its undirected this will be symmetric), then to compute the number of length k paths starting from vertex i and ending at j, it turns out all you need to do is look at the (i,j) entry of the kth power of the matrix. So to find the number of length k paths starting from vertex i, you just sum row i of the kth power of the
[10:45:44] <rubiksdream> matrix. Thus to figure out all possible length k paths, you sum all the entries of the kth power of the matrix together

[10:49:01] <rubiksdream> if you're aware of this method to count the number of paths between two vertices of some graph, it is easier to see how it can be applied, all of this basically comes with experience :)
[10:49:26] <kobalt> rubiksdream: yes I have read about it. but how do you find A^{10}. computer?

[19:15:53] *** Quits: texasmusicinstru (~Rheanna@218.78.77.129) (Remote host closed the connection)
[19:17:01] <somiaj> but since vector spaces have basis, if you have a vector space with dimension n, whose bases is {v1, v2, v3, ..., vn}, then every vector can be written in the form a1 v1 + a2 v2 + a3 v3 + .... + an vn, so it is convient to just write the vector as (a1, a2, a3, ..., an), when the basis is known
[19:17:19] <somiaj> hence a tuple can be used to represent a vector, but can also be used for other things in which vector operations are not present.

[19:17:58] <somiaj> though this isn't really different than our base 10 numbers, 142.85 is really 100 + 4*10 + 2 + 8/10 + 5/100, but we choose to write it as 142.85 (basically a list of numbers) for convience

[19:21:18] <cherim> I still see no relevance for "factrization into primes" topic there, however. There is also an intermediate O(nlogn) solutiion where one can cite the prime sieve complexity, but it's far-fetched
[19:21:52] <cherim> The cleanest O(n) uses nextFlag[i] and looping only up to sqrt(n) for K.
[19:21:59] <cherim> What's yours?
[19:22:12] <pyzozord> here is my solution https://app.codility.com/demo/results/trainingSVGW5Q-WTU/
[19:22:39] <pyzozord> it's O(n log n) if n is peaks, but that's O(n) if n is entire trip
[19:23:51] <pyzozord> took me a lot of effort to realize that I cannot simply use distances between neighbour peaks because the peaks I picked don't need to be necessairly neighbours
[19:24:06] <pyzozord> after I realized that fact it took me 30 minutes to write correct solution
[19:24:15] <pyzozord> took me 3 days to realize that fact though

[19:26:13] <pyzozord> the relationship with primes was just the structure of n log n algorithm. Just the idea you can "skip" when looping esentially
[19:26:26] <ppw> is it ever proper to put proofs at the end of some assignment that deals extensively with math, but you don't want to disrupt the flow of the assignment?
[19:26:44] *** Joins: quartz (~quartz@user/quartz)
[19:26:54] <cherim> This is what I mentioned above as "O(nlogn) solutiion where one can cite the prime sieve complexity", since sum_{i} n/i is prime sieve
[19:27:37] <cherim> Note that you can never put more than sqrt(n) flags anyway, there is simply not enough space
[19:27:40] <pyzozord> well I didn't really understand what you said, I don't really understand it now either
[19:28:31] <cherim> And you can test whether you can put k flags in O(k), just applying curr=peaks[curr+k] k times
[19:29:02] <cherim> So you only have to do O(1+2+3+...+sqrt(n))=O(n) work total
[19:29:32] <pyzozord> i don't really follow that, I just simulate where to put flags but skip to the next first legal peak or break

[19:31:04] <pyzozord> but yeah it is 1+2+3...sqrt(n) that's what I concluded as well

[19:35:29] <pyzozord> remember: absolutely no mathematical education
[19:35:44] <cherim> When i < sqrt(n), your j loop takes ~i time
[19:35:54] <cherim> When i > sqrt(n), your j loop takes ~n/i time
[19:36:26] <cherim> In the first case because you exit after i flags set, in the second because you jump by i and do n/i jumps
[19:36:34] <cherim> Agree?
[19:37:05] <pyzozord> i think in the first case i still skip. I don't see the relationship to sqrt(n)
[19:37:36] <pyzozord> so I think it's ~n/i jumps always
[19:38:07] <cherim> There is also break in line 31?
[19:38:26] <cherim> You immediately exit when i flags set, even if i< n/i?
[19:39:02] <pyzozord> no, notice that in line 15 the loop continues until j<A.length
[19:39:24] <pyzozord> break in line 31 is meant as "if you have no more flags to set, stop walking"

[19:40:18] <pyzozord> so it's "walk from start to finishing: instead of walking jump on peaks, plant a flag, if you are out of flags stop walking"
[19:41:46] <cherim> In the sitation where almost everything is a peak, every jump results in flag++
[19:41:51] <cherim> That's the worst case
[19:41:55] <pyzozord> that's all wrapped in the bigger loop "ok we will try walking entire trip with different amounts of flags, start with one flag, end with end with as many flags as meters"
[19:42:13] <cherim> After each flag++, you test if (flags == i) break
[19:42:33] <cherim> There is no way you do more than "flags set" steps if every step results in a new flag

[19:44:36] <pyzozord> it will try N times to make only one step
[19:44:52] <cherim> But the whole point of what I am explaining here is that your code is O(nlogn), if you agree (but for another reason), it's OK
[19:45:41] <pyzozord> I thought it was O(n log n) too
[19:45:49] <cherim> What I say is that you can make the outer i loop not till n, but till sqrt(n)+1 or such, keeping validity
[19:46:00] <cherim> And that will make the code O(n)

[22:19:33] <vckt> here is what i've tried so far

[22:20:27] <vckt> i'm confused as to whether i can conclude in the next step by saying that by the definition of C, we can say:

[22:42:47] <rubiksdream> vckt something that might be useful for these sorts of situations is, given any nonempty set A \subset R, (bounded below or above is irrelevant in fact), x \in [-inf,inf] is equal to inf(A) iff it is a lower bound of A (in the extended sense if x = -infinity), and there is a sequence {a_n} in A whose limit is x
[22:43:16] <rubiksdream> this characterizes infimum, and the analogous statement characterizes supremum

[22:45:31] <riv> I was thinking to use completions, inf A is the minimum element of A^\bar and in terms of the example { 1/n | n in N } we just add 0 to the set to complete it
[22:45:35] <rubiksdream> so to prove it, first you proceed as you did, and say clearly inf(A) + inf(B) <= y for any y \in A + B , and then take some sequence a_n -> inf(A), and b_n -> inf(B) in A,B resp. and then note a_n+b_n -> inf(A) + inf(B)

[22:48:57] <vckt> hmm that makes sense, but i wonder if its also possible without using those sequences
[22:48:58] <riv> it's just a different way to talk about the same thing: a sequence {a_n} in A whose limit is x
[22:48:59] <rubiksdream> you do need completeness to show infimums/supremums actually exist
[22:49:30] <riv> vckt, consider the example A = { 1/n | n in N }, sequences and limits are needed
[22:49:46] <Z-module> vckt: yes, you can prove it using nothing but the direct definition of inf, not using any convergent sequences
[22:50:32] <rubiksdream> but i honestly don't see how you can prove this without at some stage using 'by def of infimum, there are points in the set that can be made arbitrarily close to this number'
[22:50:37] <Z-module> In two steps:  Show that s = inf(A) + inf(B) is *some* lower bound for the set A + B, and then show that nothing > s has that property.
[22:50:49] <vckt> well ig ive shown the first part
[22:50:56] <vckt> and i need to show the second
[22:50:58] <rubiksdream> in your second step, im not sure how you would proceed without using the property I just claimed
[22:51:00] <riv> <riv> So subproblem: Let A be a set bounded below, show that inf A exists

[22:53:23] <rubiksdream> and this is pretty common in analysis courses i think

[22:56:58] <vckt> A_0 would be the set of lower bounds, and from the axiom a_0 <= r so ig r exists(i.e. inf(A) exists)
[22:57:18] <rubiksdream> you dont need completeness to assert that between two real numbers, there is another real number (which is what your thing boils down to)
[22:57:24] <rubiksdream> just take the midpoint
[22:57:36] <riv> well you can complete the set of all lower bounds, or you can just complete the original set
[22:57:43] <riv> either way you get an infimum
[22:58:27] <vckt> hmm what do we mean by "completing a set"
[22:58:27] <riv> actually you do not need to complete the set of all lower bounds, it's already closed

[22:59:20] <rubiksdream> oh.. your r works for all a_0\in A_0, a \in A.., so you're saying A_0 has a supremum by completeness because its bounded above?

[23:17:12] <dila> i came up with this generator test: factor p-1 into primes, for every possible product of the set of factors (2^n total, where n is the number of prime factors), exponentiate and check if g^c=1
[23:17:48] <dila> clarification: p is actually the order of the field extension, not the order of the base field (so not prime)
[23:19:10] <dila> clearly g^(p-1)=1, but this should not hold for any smaller exponent
[23:23:25] *** Quits: Crescendo (~Crescendo@user/crescendo) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[23:25:12] <Z-module> by tradition, the order of a finite field that is not just a prime itself is denoted q  (or p^n )

[23:27:03] <dila> thanks. i notice that my method of listing the prime factors won't work for primes of multiplicity
[23:27:37] <Z-module> and if you have the prime factorization of q - 1, a nice shortcut to test such a g is:  for each prime p dividing q - 1, check that  g^((q - 1)/p) != 1.  That holding for every such prime p is equivalent to g being a generator.

[23:35:31] <mawk> mod p
[23:35:45] <qergle> it's the same thing
[23:35:48] <Z-module> That's because every positive m with g^m = 1 in the group F^* (the nonzero elements under F's multiplication, where F is F_q) is a positive multiple of g's order in F^*, and if this order is not q - 1  (that is, if g is not a generator), then the order is some proper divisor d of q - 1, and in this d, at least one prime factor p of q - 1 will occur to a smaller power than it does in q - 1. So d | (q - 1)/p , so  g^((q - 1)/p) = 1  in

[23:43:32] <dila> Z-module: so you have g^a = 1, then also (g^a)^b = 1, and g^ab = g^m = 1, so you're saying that a divides m

[23:44:08] <dila> where a is the order of g in F^*
[23:45:05] <Z-module> In any finite group such as F^*, the *only* positive integers m giving g^m = 1 are:  g^d, g^(2d), g^(3d), ...   where d is the order of g -- the smallest positive exponent that works.
[23:45:49] <Z-module> and also |F^*| is a multiple of d
[23:45:57] <Z-module> (no matter what element g is)
[23:46:07] <Z-module> (each having some order d, varying with g)
[23:48:14] <Z-module> so you only need to look at divisors of q - 1 as possible orders of g
[23:48:37] <Z-module> since q - 1 = |F^*|

[23:49:28] <dila> Z-module: i understand this much, as a consequence of lagranges theorem
[23:49:32] <Z-module> well, instead of checking all of g^1, g^2, g^3, ..., g^(q - 2)  for being != 1, you only need to check exponents of the form (q - 1)/p  for primes p that divide q - 1.
[23:50:29] <dila> ok. that's the shortcut then, for prime divisors and not just any divisor
[23:50:53] <Z-module> Since some proper divisor d of q - 1 that that *does* give 1 for that means also so will (q - 1)/p for some prime p, namely any prime factor p of q - 1 that occurs in d to a smaller power than it does in q - 1.
[23:51:26] <Z-module> In other words, if d is a proper divisor of q - 1, then some positive multiple of d will have the form (q - 1)/p
[23:51:52] <Z-module> and if d is the order of g, then also you'd get  g^((q - 1)/d) = 1
[23:52:08] <dila> thanks, i understand how to apply the test, but i don't completely see why it works tonight
[23:52:22] <Z-module> It's just basic finite group theory.
[23:53:32] <dila> doesn't it depend on the group being cyclic?
[23:53:43] <Z-module> not at all, amazingly
[23:54:04] <dila> of course only cyclic groups have generators. i guess it's too late for me.
[23:54:08] <Z-module> It's just a test for g *not* being a generator by itself.
[23:54:20] <Z-module> (whether or not any actual such other generator exists)
[23:54:47] <dila> i suppose the test would fail in non-cyclic groups?
[23:55:01] <dila> or how could it even apply?
[23:56:17] <Z-module> In any finite group G at all (cyclic or not, abelian or not), given g in G, then:   G != <g>    iff    some prime p dividing |G| exists with  g^(|G|/p) = e  (the identity of G, which we call 1 in a field's multiplicative group).
[23:56:47] <Z-module> In your case of a finite field F, you do always know that F^* happens to be cyclic.
[23:57:07] <Z-module> So you'll eventually be able to find some g in F^* that does not have that prime p as I was just describing.
[23:57:30] <dila> thanks, i understand. every g sweeps out a cyclic subgroup. and i beleve that G = <g> is actually the definition of a cylic group
[23:57:33] <mh_le> Z-module: query, if you have time :)
[23:58:02] <Z-module> in other words, you'll have   g^((|F| - 1)/p) != 1   for *all* primes p dividing |F| - 1.   This is the case iff g is a generator for F^*.
[23:58:21] <Z-module> dila, yes, the existence of such a g, that is the definition of G being cyclic
