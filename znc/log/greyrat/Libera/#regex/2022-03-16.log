[00:04:01] <regex123> how to match {End}{Article}a\s and ignore {End}{Article}a$
[00:04:42] <regex123> {End}{Article}a, this a is any small letter
[00:14:04] <OnlineCop> Only `a` if it is after {End}{Article} ?
[00:14:35] <OnlineCop> https://regex101.com/r/KE2YPK/2
[00:15:50] <OnlineCop> If the complete letter/word "a" should not match, but "about" or "a[more_letters]" are allowed, use a negative lookahead and use `\b` to force that it will only be "a[word_boundary]" and not 'a' followed by anything else.
[00:16:38] <OnlineCop> If you specifically want to match 'a' except when it's at the end of a line, use (?!a$) instead.

[00:20:51] <regex123> need ignore {End}{Article}a\n and match like {End}{Article}a pair
[00:21:21] <OnlineCop> https://regex101.com/r/KE2YPK/4 ?
[00:21:58] <OnlineCop> Since `$` matches only at the end of lines, `(?!$)` will NOT match when you're at the end of the line.
[00:24:47] <regex123> this https://regex101.com/r/KE2YPK/4 ignore {End}{Article}a but match only [{End}{Article}a] pair
[00:25:18] <regex123> need match any after {End}{Article}a, like {End}{Article}a pair or {End}{Article}a vial
[00:25:36] <regex123> only ignore {End}{Article}a$
[00:26:03] <regex123> and match {End}{Article}a.
[00:42:23] <OnlineCop> Add `.*` to the end.

[01:40:16] <webadmin> lol
[01:41:21] <OnlineCop> convert_quotes(str); # "How's everyone doing?"
[01:43:32] <webadmin> So do different linux OS use different styles of regex?
[01:43:44] <webadmin> Like centos vs redhat?
[01:44:07] <webadmin> regex101 shows so many styles of regex I didn't know existed
[01:45:26] <OnlineCop> They can, but it's usually the applications themselves that determine which flavor they use.
[01:45:56] *** Joins: k8yun (~k8yun@user/k8yun)
[01:46:48] <OnlineCop> FreeBSD grep doesn't support PCRE, so at best it's got ERE (extended regex). GNU grep supports PCRE. Perl... well, is perl. sed and awk are usually BRE (basic regex) or ERE with some flags, but that could be distro-specific.
[01:48:24] <OnlineCop> I think if a beginner were to want to learn regex, the Javascript/ECMAScript flavor has "enough" features that someone could try it out in, say, vscode, and start to fiddle around with things.
[01:49:33] <k8yun> I used to know a website (I think) that I can play game with regex.  I think it was a website.  Does this ring a bell to anyone?
[01:49:52] <OnlineCop> Regex golf, regex crosswords?
[01:50:19] <OnlineCop> Crosswords had the user try to match patterns horizontally and simultaneously vertically.
[01:50:33] <OnlineCop> Golf is "make it as short as possible".
[01:51:42] <OnlineCop> Regex101 has quizzes that build on previous ones to help users get acclimated to new features/patterns.

[20:52:41] <re101-guppy-65> sorry - I think I closed the wrong tab and lost the replace that worked. That search finds the numbers and the : in the middle, but the replace with is what falls down in word. I am not a developer (this is all new territory)

[21:25:10] <re101-guppy-65> thanks :)
[21:25:56] <re101-guppy-65> ahh
[21:26:26] <purplex> okay, i want you to try the regex on a blank document with just 123:123, 4:6, 12346:123.. then what results do you get?
[21:26:49] <re101-guppy-65> ok - from the terms you pasted earlier?
[21:26:59] <purplex> yes, latest regex
[21:27:03] <re101-guppy-65> k
[21:27:26] <purplex> that would be: <([0-9]{1,3}):([0-9]{1,3})> and \1: \2
[21:28:17] <re101-guppy-65> 0 replacements
[21:29:06] <purplex> on my end, i got: "All done, we made 2 replacements"
[21:29:47] <re101-guppy-65> sheesh.... - assuming you have wildcardsenabled - can't imagine it works outside of that
[21:29:56] <purplex> can you just 'Find' the text using the wildcard, if find doesn't work then likely replace won't either
[21:30:02] <re101-guppy-65> ahh -
[21:30:25] <re101-guppy-65> in my testing I had disabled wild cards - made 3 replacements
[21:31:23] <purplex> did you have exact numbers in document as i pasted?
[21:31:38] <re101-guppy-65> sorry - 2 replacements - out of the 123:123 the : is gone and from 4:6 the : is gone too - didn't touch the loinger one bacause I have {1,3} in there
[21:31:49] <re101-guppy-65> yes exact - copy and paste
[21:31:51] <purplex> we are getting there..
[21:32:02] <re101-guppy-65> haha - we are - thanks for your help and patience
[21:33:56] <re101-guppy-65> do you have any other checkboxes checked in the search other than use wildcards ?
[21:35:23] <re101-guppy-65> GOT IT :)
[21:38:57] <re101-guppy-65> feck it - no I didn't - this worked in the tiny sample in the new doc ([0-9]{1,3})([:])([0-9]{1,3}) and \1 \2  \3 - but when used in the book it doesn't work ... it jumbles up numbers

[21:43:18] <re101-guppy-65> one other factor which I didn't think would be an issues is that some of these number are in footnotes
[21:45:12] <re101-guppy-65> just tried regular text and iot works - its the footnotes component that is freaking this out.
[21:45:34] <purplex> is there really a large set of these numbers in your document?

[21:46:05] <re101-guppy-65> it is throwing the extra space after the last number.
[21:46:44] <re101-guppy-65> kinda - 1,587
[21:48:27] <purplex> what does the footnotes component look like?

[21:50:26] <re101-guppy-65> not sure what you mean - for example, the part I'm trying to work on is scripture references so its all things like  . “Let the whole earth be filled with his glory; Amen, and Amen” (Psalm 72:19).
[21:50:27] <re101-guppy-65> “As the waters cover the sea” (Isaiah 11:9).
[21:50:27] <re101-guppy-65>  . “Lift up your eyes, look around and see; All these gather together and come to you” (Isaiah 49:18 NKJV).
[21:50:28] <re101-guppy-65>  . “Then [Jacob] dreamed, and behold, a ladder was set up on the earth, and its top reached to heaven: and there the angels of God were ascending and descending on it” (Genesis 28:12 NKJV).
[21:50:28] <re101-guppy-65> When I past this as regular text in word and not as a footnote it becomes

[21:52:17] <purplex> i pasted all the bible you wrote in my word, and it works pretty well so far with replace
[21:52:32] <re101-guppy-65> it is when they are footnotes
[21:52:44] <re101-guppy-65> as regular text it is fine
[21:53:14] <purplex> what do footnotes look like?

[21:54:15] <purplex> okay so the footnotes are so same as text but footnotes :p
[21:54:58] <purplex> yeah, what you can do is: find 'style' of fonts
[21:55:35] <purplex> if fonts are smaller, word can ignore words with small fonts. its a special kind of 'find'
[21:56:02] <re101-guppy-65> sorry yes - kinda just sub/superscript style - ohh ok
[21:57:40] <purplex> i just tested it, works as expected with wildcards.
[21:59:03] <re101-guppy-65> with the content as footnotes or just in main body content?
[21:59:53] <purplex> with sub/superscript style excluded from search

[22:01:14] <MiguelX413> hello
[22:03:01] <re101-guppy-65> yeah - sorry I thought this would be a simpler answer - I guess its MS Word regex lite wildcards that is the culprit here - well thanks anyhow - I think I'm closer

[22:22:05] <re101-guppy-65> purplex farn and anyone else who tried to help today - much appreciation to you kind people - I just re-created one page and had the text as body content and the same text as its own footnote and it works completely. It seems therefore there is some script strangeness buried in the footnote region of this document, and that is why it falls down.
[22:22:05] <re101-guppy-65> Everything you would have created in a doc from scratch and run your regex on prolly worked fine. My new doc with just one page worked flawlessly with search ([0-9]{1,3})([:])([0-9]{1,3}) replace with \1\2  \3 - Thanks again kind people - have a brilliant week.

[22:44:58] <re101-dusky-48> Hello! I need to extract last two words from string that arent enclosed in brackets. The problem is - I can`t make it ignore the brackets and everything between them. What I`ve made so far: https://regex101.com/r/z54EgP/1  All this is supposed to operate as part of a formula in google sheets.
[22:47:29] <purplex> you basically want everything except (тест) and (article)
[22:48:18] <re101-dusky-48> I want this -> Марина Синенко
[22:48:43] <purplex> are these really last two or, first two?
[22:48:50] <re101-dusky-48> Last two
[22:49:20] <purplex> we can test it on four words long string as well, alright
[22:52:40] *** Joins: awmv (~awmv@mob-194-230-148-95.cgn.sunrise.net)
[22:52:42] <purplex> PCRE acceptable?
[22:55:01] <re101-dusky-48> Google sheets uses RE2, and it says: "It also lists some syntax accepted by PCRE, PERL, and VIM."
[22:55:12] <re101-dusky-48> So probably?

[22:57:56] <purplex> also added /m https://regex101.com/r/z54EgP/3
[23:00:16] <purplex> RE2 may work like this https://regex101.com/r/z54EgP/4

[23:04:05] <re101-dusky-48> Thanks, but it`s not exactly what I wanted. I need only the last pair, all the previous pairs are irrelevant. Maybe there is something like \K that forces the end of the match, not the start?
[23:04:52] <purplex> you can use the group 1, right?

[23:07:13] <re101-dusky-48> I am trying to use REGEXEXTRACT(text, regular_expression), don`t know if there is some function that support groups.
[23:07:29] <re101-dusky-48> Let me check
[23:10:37] <purplex> RE2 is very limited, it won't likely have those things to make it group free.
[23:11:35] <purplex> if you had no brackets at the end, then you could just do: 33[А-я]+ [А-я]+$ probably
[23:12:40] <re101-dusky-48> Yes, if only I had no brackets :)
[23:14:18] <re101-dusky-48> Apparently it is possible to capture groups in google sheets, but I need to write some JS code to do that.
[23:14:46] <purplex> if there's one word in brackets then: 61[А-я]+ [А-я]+ \([A-Za-zА-я]+\)$ you can then run another regex to extract first two word .
[23:15:35] <purplex> but i'd go with groups, there's possibly a function for working with them
[23:17:28] <purplex> its simple and basic regex, to include a full range of cyrillic letters, i recall other regex flavors offer better options
[23:18:44] <re101-dusky-48> Working with groups in GS is problematic at best, and it`s what JS is needed for. Still it`s probably my best bet.
[23:19:05] <re101-dusky-48> Thank you for help everyone.
[23:19:28] <purplex> you can probably use different software to apply regex to your sheets.
[23:19:45] <purplex> welcome!
