[13:02:25] <jybz> disable sasl
[13:02:31] <jybz> you nick have been droped

[13:08:44] <style> same shit Casper
[13:08:49] <style> with my 1.6.6 and inspircd

[13:08:58] <Casper> What shit exactly? The SASL thing?
[13:09:17] <KindOne> sasl has always been annoying with InspIRCd for whatever reasons
[13:09:28] <Casper> KindOne, works perfectly fine on later ZNC versions tbh.
[13:09:29] <style> DarthGandalf... it is, but there is an error somewhere between znc 1.6.6 and inspircd
[13:09:52] <Casper> Time to update. :D
[13:09:57] <style> I noticed this thing when I connected on Casper's network
[13:10:18] <style> Casper... to much work and for sure lots of the new features will not work with the design im using
[13:10:33] <Casper> Ah, right, you were using Firrre's theme, right?
[13:10:38] <style> yep

[13:10:41] <DarthGandalf> [15 июн., 09:40:27] <*sasl> PLAIN mechanism succeeded.
[13:10:46] <DarthGandalf> style: works for me
[13:10:53] <style> DarthGandalf what znc version ?
[13:10:55] <Casper> That's where I came from too, but it required some more modification indeed :P
[13:10:56] <DarthGandalf> git
[13:10:58] <DarthGandalf> 1.9
[13:11:07] <style> im talking about 1.6.6
[13:11:09] <Casper> DarthGandalf, newer ZNC verions work fine, just not 1.6.6 :P 
[13:11:14] <DarthGandalf> mhm
[13:11:15] <Casper> versions*
[13:11:19] <DarthGandalf> well, upgrade then
[13:11:25] <style> can't :D
[13:11:27] <Casper> I think Firrre's theme even has some bugs in it by default.
[13:11:31] <style> I like firrre's theme to much
[13:11:33] <Casper> Can, you just don't want to lose bootstrap. :p
[13:11:44] <style> exactly
[13:11:53] <DarthGandalf> ask firrre to update the theme...
[13:12:01] <style> firrre is ... gone ;D
[13:12:44] <DarthGandalf> style: btw, how did you get the vhost there?

[13:13:21] <DarthGandalf> hm, but @freenode-uigi2c.l7fp.dsim.7dvncl.IP
[13:13:28] <DarthGandalf> oh, you can remove it?
[13:13:29] <style> is a ip mask

[13:13:32] <style> yes
[13:13:35] <style> //mode $me -x
[13:13:38] <DarthGandalf> I see
[13:13:53] <style> and iv added a perform now for -x too
[13:13:54] <style> and thats it.
[13:14:18] <Casper> You might want +x-x tbh
[13:14:27] <Casper> Because if you get @freenode/user/<acc>, you don't have +x
[13:14:41] <Casper> You have to set +x to get the 'default' cloak, then -x to get your rDNS to show.
[13:14:45] <style> im not asking for a cloak
[13:14:56] <style> dont need it.
[13:14:56] <Casper> You GET one when identifying.

[15:46:47] <s7r> DarthGandalf, thanks
[15:47:09] <DarthGandalf> sure
[15:47:15] <s7r> DarthGandalf: so what happens to the history of the registered nicknames? I mean, if someone wanted to check how long one person has been using IRC
[15:47:25] *** Quits: gry (~quassel@botters/gry) (Quit: gone)
[15:47:26] <s7r> like in the legacy network i was registered many many years ago
[15:47:27] <DarthGandalf> I'm mostly staying there to help informing people who didn't get the news yet
[15:47:34] <DarthGandalf> until they kline me for doing that, ofc
[15:47:56] <s7r> you have been of huge help for me. i saw the notifications from the server few weeks ago but i treated it as spam or didn't care
[15:48:21] <s7r> but now if you try to check my registered nickname, it appears that it has been registered today right?
[15:48:30] <bookworm> who cares
[15:48:30] <DarthGandalf> if someone wanted to check how long one person has been using IRC, they shouldn't trust any single nickserv's info

[15:48:50] <DarthGandalf> libera opened only on 19th May
[15:48:58] <DarthGandalf> less than month ago
[15:49:42] <Casper> And any data on freenode-classic will be gone, or at least not transferred to new freenode.
[15:51:12] <gry> gone - no, the guy might decide to sell it
[15:51:24] <gry> not transferred - sounds likely ...
[15:51:34] <s7r> such a mess
[15:51:49] <Casper> Or has there been a policy update right before the new net opened, stating that any info can be logged and sold if wanted? :P
[15:52:10] <Casper> 'By registering an account at new freenode, you declare to be submissive to the crown prince of korea' :^)
