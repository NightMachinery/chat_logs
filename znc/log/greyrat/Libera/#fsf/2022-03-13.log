[07:01:03] <tpefreedom> Is the open watcoom compiler not ideal?
[07:01:15] <tpefreedom> Is it under a free license?
[07:01:28] <tpefreedom> If so is the license GPL compatible?
[07:02:10] <jxself> It's a nonfree compiler.
[07:02:15] <jxself> See https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html#Watcom
[07:04:08] <jxself> Check out #1.4 in https://directory.fsf.org/wiki/License:Watcom-1.0
[07:04:20] <tpefreedom> hmm
[07:04:20] <jxself> "Deploy" means ... any and all internal use ... of Covered Code within Your business or organization
[07:04:57] <tpefreedom> are there any 16 bit x86 compilers that are free/libre and produce good quality code?
[07:05:10] <jxself> https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html
[07:05:28] <jxself> That piece conflicts with certain part of the Free Software Definition.
[07:06:04] <jxself> " The freedom to run the program means the freedom for any kind of person or organization to use it on any kind of computer system, for any kind of overall job and purpose, without being required to communicate about it with the developer or any other specific entity."
[07:06:20] <jxself> "You should also have the freedom to make modifications and use them privately in your own work or play, without even mentioning that they exist. If you do publish your changes, you should not be required to notify anyone in particular, or in any particular way."
[07:07:08] <tpefreedom> Ok, but are there any free/libre compilers that would be good cantidates for a 16 bit x86 compiler?
[07:08:44] <jxself> GCC? I have not examine how good it is for 16-bit stuff though.
[07:09:43] <tpefreedom> Or is it not worth focusing on freedos?
[07:13:14] <damo22> coreboot uses gcc to compile the 16-bit bootblock entry vector.  it should work in theory 
[07:14:27] <jxself> But even if it's not technically as good as the Open Watcom compiler it's at least free software. By that standard it's far better than Open Watcom. :)
[07:14:44] *** Joins: Wh0 (~V@103.86.19.99)
[07:15:00] <tpefreedom> The other problem with freedos is that there is little free software available for it afaik. It seems mostly to be there for running old dos games.
[07:15:34] <damo22> what is the point of freedos other than to play old dos games?
[07:15:45] <damo22> and flash utilities
[07:16:05] <jxself> It's still nonfree software being run in the end.

[07:20:20] <tpefreedom> I do still think it could be a useful platform for hobbyist development. Afaik freedos, ms-dos, etc (all the way back to cp/m) have far fewer moving parts than most modern OSes, which for example have many features for multiuser setups that would not be needed for many smaller projects.
[07:20:40] <tpefreedom> It is also much more lightweight (I think it can run on 1 or 2 MB of ram).
[07:21:20] <damo22> openwrt does too

[07:33:48] <damo22> im not sure if you are correct qrpnxz, but in any case, AGPL is designed for server software that exposes an interface over the network to users

[07:34:32] <damo22> so in that case if you change the source and present an update to users over the network, it is nice that the user can get a copy of the modified source from the site itself
[07:38:34] <qrpnxz> yeah, AGPL very particular. It doesn't care if you use the product of the software through a kiosk or if you send me mail and i run the software to get the result and then mail back the result. It just a complete ad hoc. Tell me, how would a webserver advertise its source code? Does it inject the pages it serve with links? How about a TCP implementation? Does it include a notice on every pack
[07:38:36] <qrpnxz> et?
[07:39:51] <qrpnxz> How would youtubes back-end advertise its source? The front-end might not display it. Youtube could change the location of the notice at any point.
[07:43:06] <qrpnxz> or perhaps that doesn't count as "interaction with users", then basically no back-end has to do anything. Running the application on a remote X server doesn't count, and that's the most obvious example of something that interacts with the user in the conventional sense.
[07:51:19] <qrpnxz> If i go to an ATM, would it be reasonable for me to demand the ATM gave me a link to its source? This sounds really unreasonable to me. It is not my ATM, i'm just using it. If i go to the teller to do the same thing and then she turns around and inputs my data into the terminal to do the exact same thing, it seem even more ridiculous now that i demand to see the source. But if i interact with
[07:51:21] <qrpnxz>  the ATM wirelessly, now the AGPL wants to butt in.

[22:08:19] <qrpnxz> not just a gpl problem, lot of add ons are MPL also and the situation isn't much better then. If the homepage happens to be a github repo you got lucky, but this is not always the case.
