[02:07:54] <HelloShitty> no no, I was just confirming I understood it correctly

[18:25:08] <hexadecimal> you know how much it cost to run 9 nodes?
[18:25:18] <hexadecimal> close to 1000 dollar / month
[18:25:46] <DeanGuss> Sounds like a choice.  Pretty sure I could pull it off for cheaper
[18:25:58] <hexadecimal> no you can't

[18:26:39] <DeanGuss> you also don't need an ssd
[18:27:58] <hexadecimal> you can run bitcoind behind tor from an raspberry but that node will do nothing it will be just on the outer edge of the Bitcoin network
