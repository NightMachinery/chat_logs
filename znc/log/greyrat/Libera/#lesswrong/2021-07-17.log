[00:30:00] <Robomot> PDF (15 pages; 1.6 MB) - CioSy: A Collaborative Blockchain-Based Insurance System (Faiza Loukil, Khouloud Boukadi, Rasheed Hussain and Mourad Abed) - The insurance industry is heavily dependent on several processes executed among multiple entities, such as insurer, insured, and third-party services. The increasingly competitive environment is pushing insurance companies to use advanced technologies to address …
[00:33:39] <dbohdan> 'We generated up to 1000 different insured accounts, and compiled and deployed an InsurancePolicy smart contract for each account. ... We observe that the processing time increases with the number of insured accounts, ranging from 0 to 240 s. Furthermore, Figure 4 shows that the total time required for smart contract interaction is strictly linear to the number of the insured accounts.'
[00:34:03] <Gurkenglas> and theoretically it should be simple enough to throw up a smart contract like "you stake 100$. i pay you 1$ a month for 12 months and if i upload evidence of x$ of damage for x<=100$ I get x or you pay 2$ to $judge to publicly decide where the 100$ goes - all to you if im obviously unreasonable, all to me if im obviously reasonable."

[02:54:14] <Logos01> I meant to write bedroom. Mea culpa.
[02:54:24] <Logos01> But master bath is usually the bathroom attached directly to the master bedroom.
[02:54:42] <kuudes> ah indeed, usa has toilets per each bathroom often

[02:58:04] <Logos01> In the 70's and 80's they were smaller.
[02:58:12] <Logos01> After the 2000's they are usually built larger.

[03:18:03] <kuudes> Betawolf, interest rates are low
[03:19:17] <Betawolf> kuudes: that just means his mortgage will get even more insane 
[03:20:48] <Logos01> Betawolf: It's worth noting that more than half of the value increase has happened in the last six months.
[03:20:55] <kuudes> Betawolf, what do you mean?
[03:21:00] <Logos01> And yes I am aware of how bad this likely is in long-term financial decision terms.
[03:21:13] <Betawolf> Logos01: aren't you worried about- oh okay.
[03:21:52] <Logos01> The last time I bought a house was two years before the housing bubble in 2010.
[03:22:09] <kuudes> hmm, so the interest of the loan is more than the rent? O_O
[03:22:16] <kuudes> I didn't get it the first reading
[03:22:59] <Logos01> kuudes: So the trick behind that statement is the amortization schedule.
[03:23:43] <Betawolf> kuudes: yes, that's the correct face.
[03:24:49] <saturn2> kuudes: in a standard american mortgage there's a fixed monthly payment and interest rate for the whole 30 years
[03:25:02] <Logos01> This is a thing all lenders do. They allocate your payment proportionately towards the interest and principal of the note.
[03:25:38] <kuudes> over here the interest and principal are itemized per payment
[03:26:04] <Logos01> kuudes: Well you can do that by looking at the amortization schedule.
[03:26:13] <kuudes> so you may have, say, 1500 e monthly payment, of which this month 500 e goes to interest and 5 e to fees and 995 to principal
[03:26:14] <Logos01> But I don't *have* that yet because I haven't actually gotten to the part where financing happens.
[03:26:46] <kuudes> so my and presumably Betawolf's curiosity is on if your 500 e of that calc is larger than your previous rent
[03:26:51] <Logos01> kuudes: See in the US your payments in the first few years will be in the order of 70% allocated to interest.
[03:27:40] <Logos01> But in Utah (where I am) the state requires the lender to set up an escrow account to handle homeowner's insurance and real estate tax payments as well, so that gets lumped into the mortgage payment.
[03:28:28] <Logos01> So like ... out of about $2200/mo in "mortgage payment" about 700 will go to principal, 1000 to interest, and the rest split between tax, hoi, and mortgage insurance.
[03:28:52] <Logos01> (mortgage insurance is a surchage on notes that are above 80% of the total value of the property.)
[03:29:02] <kuudes> just how high or long your mortgages are?
[03:29:42] <Logos01> Well the note will be above 390k and below 400k so I've been using 400k as the rounded term for this discussion.
[03:30:00] <Logos01> And it's a 30 year note.
[03:30:33] <Logos01> https://www.bankrate.com/calculators/mortgages/amortization-calculator.aspx <-- plug in 400k and 3.0% and click "show amortization" to show what payments would roughly look like.
[03:30:33] <Robomot> Amortization Schedule Calculator | Bankrate (The mortgage amortization schedule shows how much in principal and interest is paid over time. See how those payments break down over your loan term with our amortization calculator.)
[03:31:58] <Logos01> (Also, this is one of the reasons why especially in the first few years if you can make double-payments on the mortgage, doing so can dramatically reduce the total cost of the mortgage.)
[03:32:22] <Betawolf> we have a balance, with interest applied monthly as subtractions and payments applied monthly as additions. Works out the same as paying X of Y in interest, of course, but sounds different.
[03:32:23] <Logos01> Because aside from the first payment (in full) each month, any others are required by law to be applied directly to the principal.
[03:32:52] <Betawolf> And it sounds like you were talking about what we call overpayments rather than saying you had an interest-only mortgage, which makes more sense.
[03:33:10] <Logos01> "interest-only mortgage"?
[03:33:13] <Logos01> I don't know what that means.

[03:34:20] <Betawolf> Logos01: in an interest-only mortgage, you take out the loan, pay only interest on the loan, and the principal becomes due at the end of the term
[03:34:39] <Betawolf> they were abused a lot a while back, they're terrible for most homeowners 
[03:34:44] <Logos01> Betawolf: Okay so the closest I understand of that in what I'm familiar with is a balloon rider.
[03:35:20] <Logos01> Back when the bubble was growing you'd see a bunch of 5-year Option ARMs with balloon riders.
[03:35:49] <Logos01> (Balloon rider is a rider on a note that declares that the remainder of the note is immediately required upon end of term.)
[03:36:12] <gwern> "5-year Option ARM with balloon rider" "Childhood toy for boys, or advanced financial instrument?"
[03:36:40] <Logos01> People got sold on the 5-year arms on the idea that property values had been going up at a high rate for a long time and that by the time the 5-year term ended your property would be worth so much more that you would could get a dramatically better note to handle the remainder.
[03:36:50] <Betawolf> The idea is you take the money you would've put into the principal and invest it instead into profitable ventures, so at the end of the term you can hand back the principal and keep the difference. In practice, a bunch of people who have no ability to do that just took it as a way to have a lower mortgage payment and got fucked over.
[03:37:10] <Logos01> Like, with the rate things have been going now if I refinace in a year I could, even without overpayments, get enough equity to eliminate the mortgage insurance.
[03:37:26] <Logos01> Just from property value accruals.
[03:37:54] <Logos01> I happen to know that the current rate of growth won't stop for at least another 12-15 months, and almost certainly won't see a rapid decline.
[03:37:57] <saturn2> i believe during the bubble there were even no-payment mortgages where the interest just got added on as an additional loan
[03:38:09] <Logos01> The entire lender industry is reacting with extreme paranoia to repeating what happened in 2010.
[03:38:49] <Logos01> saturn2: I could see that done with like an 80/20 HELOC and automated negotiation on the payment being rolled into the HELOC.
[03:38:56] <Logos01> But that's not a thing anymore either.
[03:39:30] <kuudes> hmm, I guess the real interest rate then is about 4% to you
[03:39:49] <Logos01> kuudes: How do you figure?
[03:40:26] <kuudes> for a 30 year loan where in the first payment interest is about 70%, the interest is about 4% if payment is constant over the time
[03:40:56] <kuudes> regardless of the amounts
[03:41:42] <saturn2> Logos01: it's something that would only make sense for serious real estate developers, but during the bubble it was sold to random poor people because reasons
[03:42:48] <kuudes> sweden still has interest-only housing loans iirc
[03:42:53] <Logos01> kuudes: Amortization schedules slowly swap out how much goes towards interest over the term of the loan.

[03:49:20] <kuudes> oh?
[03:49:25] <Logos01> Found out I was being foreclosed on after the sale was final.
[03:49:31] <Logos01> I had never missed a payment.
[03:50:01] <kuudes> oh, so your creditor terminated the loan early?
[03:50:26] <Logos01> Plot twist: this was after the bubble collapsed, and my ex had quitclaimed completely to me after we broke up so I was at less than half the income I was when I first took out the note.

[03:50:53] <Logos01> This was *ALSO* after Obama had "mandated" a mortgage adjustment program for people whose properties lost more than 50% of their value.
[03:51:00] <Logos01> Mine had gone from 170k to 30k.
[03:51:42] <Logos01> So I had applied for and gotten written full approval of a mortgage adjustment (they rewrite the terms of the note to make the payment lower, usually by taking some other program or whatever to make up the difference.)
[03:52:00] <Logos01> So I did that for two years, and then suddenly didn't have a home anymore.
[03:52:16] <Logos01> They claimed they "never received" the mortgage adjustment application, and had no record of it.
[03:52:35] <Logos01> I had the originals with their signatures on the adjustment paperwork. But it didn't matter, since the sale was already final.
[03:53:31] <Logos01> Long story short, I wound up participating in a class action lawsuit, getting a damages payment of $15,000, the foreclosure erased from my credit history and all the late payments they reported re-stated as "paid as agreed".
[03:53:53] <kuudes> dang
[03:54:22] <Logos01> And that's the story of why you should never do business with First American.
[03:56:04] <Logos01> They pulled this "We lost your paperwork but never sent you any notices of late payment" trick on tens of thousands of people.
[03:57:28] <Logos01> Joke was on them though: in Arizona the real property laws make it clear that any indemnity which is secured by a property, if that property is seized as part of closing the note, is the total sum that the note-holder can pursue the note-signer for.
[03:57:53] <Logos01> I.e.; they had to eat the entirety of the $140k difference on the debt of the house and I walked away clean.

[04:54:45] <gwern> from what I understand from russian/chinese/north-korean expats, pretty much everyone with a brain understands that they're hearing propaganda and a biased viewpoint, but they simply cannot comprehend until they get out just how systematic, skewed, and unrepresentative it is, how simply wrong it is, how much is passed over in utter silence or just outright big lies (like "south korea invaded...
[04:54:51] <gwern> ...north korea")
[04:55:03] <gwern> it's the "fish cannot understand water" joke

[04:55:28] <saturn2> Logos01: what i was saying is "kilowatt-hours per year" is redundant, it would be like citing a distance in "teaspoon-miles per gallon" or something

[04:58:29] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: To tie this back to an earlier discussion: I remember, when I was little, reading books that made reference to people in America living in private houses that they owned, and this to me seemed more or less like some exotic fact about some obscure species in the Amazon or something
[04:58:35] <saturn2> love to live in the land of zero blind spots
[04:58:45] <Obormot\Arcturus> It didn't really translate into "America is a vastly wealthier society in every way"
[04:58:58] <gwern> but there are things like tianamen square or the fact that you can go read in the russian archives stalin signing off on il sung invading south korea which can't be so easily handwaved over as "oh well all countries are morally equivalent and have 'propaganda' in some sense who's to say what is truth"
[04:59:07] <Obormot\Arcturus> These were perfectly ordinary, commonly available books, not banned, restricted, etc., everyone could and did read them
[04:59:09] <Obormot\Arcturus> And yet
[04:59:25] <Logos01> saturn2: kilowatt-hours is a standard unit of energy measurement.
[04:59:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> When the Iron Curtain fell, or when people (like my mother's colleague that I've told the story about) went abroad to the West
[04:59:36] <Logos01> Asserting how much energy someone uses in a year is not a redundant statement.
[04:59:38] <Obormot\Arcturus> It was a huge shock
[05:00:30] <Logos01> Yes, if it was evenly distributed over that entire year it would be a small number of watts, but that's utterly irrelevant to the conversation because unlike watt-seconds or kilowatt-hours, watts are not a unit of energy but a unit of power.

[05:04:17] <feep> thank you tumblr, I now have the rationalist yard sign
[05:04:20] <Logos01> You can't convert directly from watts to joules; you *CAN* convert from watt-hours to joules.
[05:04:27] <feep> > YOU MIGHT BE WRONG
[05:04:29] <feep> > EVEN ABOUT SOMETHING YOU CONSIDER IMPORTANT
[05:04:30] <feep> > IT IS POSSIBLE THAT YOU ARE WRONG ABOUT IT
[05:04:32] <feep> it's a very big sign
[05:05:06] <meowcat> dammit, someone already made the rationalist yard sign??
[05:05:08] <Logos01> Watts are a unit of power: a unit of rate at which energy is consumed.  Without a time component added to the watt declaration, you cannot have any measurement of actual total energy used.
[05:05:25] <Logos01> So no, kilowatt-hours are *NOT* redundant.
[05:05:52] <meowcat> i guess i can still make one with "what is true is already so, believing it doesn't make it worse" and "existence precedes essence" and "let your faith die, bring your wonder"
[05:05:54] <saturn2> Logos01: it's annoying when you confidently state things that are completely wrong
[05:06:42] <feep> meowcat: no like, if I was to make one
[05:06:44] <feep> and had a yard
[05:06:47] <meowcat> "thou shalt not commit anti-epistemology", but that one's a little hinky, could use improvement
[05:06:49] <Logos01> saturn2: You're full of shit at the moment, good sir.
[05:06:51] <feep> and lived in an english speaking country
[05:06:56] <Logos01> Everything I just said is textbook correct.
[05:07:08] <Logos01> And I literally linked to relevant sections *OF* online textbooks to corroborate this.
[05:07:15] <meowcat> if you pooped recently, you are less full of shit
[05:07:52] <meowcat> "beliefs are for updating"
[05:08:08] <feep> Logos01: I think the point was that you said kilowatt hours per year
[05:08:17] <feep> I can't find it in the backlog rn but that's what I remember seeing
[05:08:33] <Logos01> feep: Yes, and that is *STILL* not redundant.
[05:08:42] <Logos01> Because it's a statement of total energy consumption over a 1-year period.
[05:08:43] <saturn2> yes, watt-hours and joules are also redundant, i was objecting to adding another hours per year factor
[05:08:52] <feep> Logos01: yeah but the year period does no work in it…
[05:08:53] <meowcat> "kg of coal burned per year" makes sense
[05:08:59] <meowcat> agreed?
[05:09:17] <feep> meowcat: yes because it's focused on mass
[05:09:26] <feep> not energy
[05:09:29] <Logos01> feep: If you want to know how much energy on average an american spends drying their clothing in one year, it's ~240kWh.
[05:09:31] <feep> er, not work*
[05:09:32] <Logos01> Now.
[05:09:33] <meowcat> if you burn one kg of coal, what unit of energy does it yield?
[05:09:45] <Logos01> How much energy does that same conceptual person use in two years?
[05:09:48] <feep> meowcat: this is a semantic debate, not a units debate
[05:09:52] <Betawolf> one koalagram
[05:10:12] <meowcat> feep: which do you want it to be?
[05:10:13] <Logos01> feep: My question has an answer if and only if you can express the term as energy per year.
[05:10:15] <feep> Logos01: but the point is that doesn't matter if you're comparing consumption.
[05:10:32] <feep> your question doesn't have a *point* if you look at consumption.
[05:11:06] <Logos01> feep: If you want to make a comparison of all energy used regardless of rate over the period of a year, then there's no other way to express it except in terms of "some energy unit" -per-year.
[05:11:08] <feep> like, if what you care about is usage over time, not per a timespan, that already has a unit. watt.
[05:11:13] <Logos01> I used kilowatt-hours as the energy unit.
[05:11:25] <feep> Logos01: yes but that is not the comparison being made, the comparison being made is consumption.
[05:11:38] <Logos01> And how else would you do it sensibly?
[05:11:40] <feep> d/dt.
[05:11:45] <feep> a timeless unit.
[05:11:58] <meowcat> if i eat a burrito, i can bike n miles.
[05:12:20] <Logos01> feep: When discussing electricity consumption that would require me to convert away from kilowatt-hours onto whatever.
[05:12:28] <feep> yes, onto kilowatt.
[05:12:31] <feep> the strictly simpler unit.
[05:12:32] <Logos01> Because kilowatt-hours are literally the default unit for any conversation of consumption of electricity.
[05:12:34] <saturn2> if someone used 24 watts for 2 years thats 48 watt-years
[05:12:37] <Logos01> kilowatts aren't a unit of energy.
[05:12:40] <feep> no, watt is.
[05:12:43] <Logos01> They're a unit of power.
[05:12:51] <feep> yes, which is use of energy over time.
[05:12:54] <Betawolf> the burrito-mile would be a measure of efficiency
[05:13:20] <meowcat> i could go bike to the tasty burrito shop with the cactus mole burritos.
[05:13:24] <Logos01> feep: So I would again have to convert *AWAY* from kilowatt-hours onto the kilowatt, after knowing the amount of time the energy is used over.
[05:13:29] <feep> Logos01: yes.
[05:13:39] <feep> which would leave you in the sensible, normal consumption unit.
[05:13:46] <Logos01> So why the fuck should I *do* that when it's already standardized and plainly sensible?
[05:13:55] <feep> I think this is an argument of what we're used to.
[05:13:58] <feep> I'm used to watt.
[05:13:59] <Logos01> feep: The normal consumption unit is kilowatt-hours.
[05:14:13] <feep> my light uses 20W. my scooter charges with 100W. my watercooker pulls like 1000W.
[05:14:19] <Logos01> Straight up. Anyone used to reading an electricity bill has to read how many kilowatt-hours they used.
[05:14:19] <meowcat> (as a rule, the best vegan food is food that wasn't meant to be vegan, it's just that the culture didn't have much meat on hand when they invented the food in question.)
[05:14:24] <feep> Logos01: no that's the unit for consumption *per process*.
[05:14:25] <Logos01> That's what is metered.
[05:14:33] <Logos01> feep: What "per process".
[05:14:34] <feep> like, per time-extended process.
[05:14:37] <Logos01> No.
[05:14:48] <feep> you use kwh to measure the energy use of making a can of tea,.
[05:14:50] <feep> *.
[05:14:51] <Logos01> The meters literally just increment upwards as energy is used and give you the sum at the end of each billing interval.
[05:15:02] <Logos01> So that's your kilowatt-hours per month.
[05:15:07] <Logos01> This is how this works.
[05:15:10] <feep> which ... *is watt*.
[05:15:13] <feep> it's just watt.
[05:15:25] <meowcat> it's also possible that the meter doesn't measure the thing that's actually expensive. see also peak consumption vs total expenditure.
[05:15:26] <Logos01> Except you have to perform extra math to do that, and it's a gibberish unit of wattage.
[05:15:41] <feep> Logos01 I really think this debate rests on whether you're used to counting consumption in terms of watt or used.
[05:15:43] <feep> or not*
[05:15:48] <feep> I'm used to this, so I prefer it.
[05:16:02] <feep> like, nobody is saying you're *wrong*.
[05:16:07] <Logos01> feep: saturn2 did.
[05:16:20] <catern> is there any kind of survey study of different organizational structures for engineering organizations?
[05:16:22] <feep> Logos01: okay, because you said something plain incorrect
[05:16:30] <Logos01> feep: I did not.
[05:16:38] <catern> software engineering, I mean
[05:16:38] <feep> Logos01: your unit *is* redundant.
[05:16:38] <Logos01> I said that watts are a unit of power not a unit of energy.
[05:16:40] <Logos01> This is a fact.
[05:16:41] <feep> it can be valid, and useful
[05:16:44] <feep> but it's definitionally redundant.
[05:16:53] <feep> it has the same unit in the numerator and denominator. that is what redundancy is.
[05:17:08] <feep> (for units)
[05:17:18] <Logos01> feep: Except it's *NOT* redundant, because expressing total energy used over a period of time can only tell you the mean rate.
[05:17:24] <Logos01> Which isn't the same as the *actual* rate.
[05:17:29] <feep> um
[05:17:31] <catern> i.e. is there something like this meme https://i.redd.it/7ibmzzc3dl931.png except not a joke
[05:17:31] <Robomot> image/png (600x584; 235 KB)
[05:17:32] <saturn2> it requires you to multiply out how many hours there are in a year if you want to convert it into anything else
[05:17:34] <feep> kwh/year also tells you the mean rate.
[05:17:44] <Logos01> feep: Yes, exactly.
[05:17:47] <Logos01> The mean rate is useless.
[05:17:52] <feep> no like...... what
[05:18:09] <feep> they're     
[05:18:11] <feep> this is the 
[05:18:12] <Logos01> It tells you nothing more than the mean rate, such as any other aspects of the usage pattern.
[05:18:18] <feep> logos01 do you think that kwh/year means "over one year"?

[08:32:09] <quanticle> gwern: *Hard* disagree. If it had been Jeff Bezos, they would have been talking about how his warehouses are the new "dark satanic mills" of our era. I see little difference in the attitudes of the Twitterati towards Bezos and Zucc
[08:32:17] * gwern reflects that there's still something faintly magical about being able to punch in a domain name, any domain, into a 'web browser' and being able to go to a wacky site anywhere in the world, hosted by and doing who knows what, and not just being limited to AOL-curated/moderated content listed under an 'AOL keyword'
[08:32:45] <gwern> quanticle: nah, the terminator photo is way more positive, and you can see a lot of bezos defense in the rocket stuff too
[08:32:50] <quanticle> gwern: I meant the Apollo control room dude
[08:32:54] <gwern> ah
[08:33:26] <gwern> yeah, that's pretty sloppy sourcing...
[08:33:44] <quanticle> Which is to say, it shouldn't be impossible to figure out the average age. NASA has published records of who was in the control room at the time of the landing. You can look at e.g. college graduation dates, etc, and come up with some estimates.
[08:34:22] <gwern> I'm sure you could, but unclear if anyone did
[08:36:19] <shawwwn> I do vaguely remember 1997 Internet, but it isn’t clear. One fellow yelled at the neighborhood boy to “take off the caps” and so he took off his hat

[08:38:38] <shawwwn> Prodigy, that’s right
[08:38:56] <shawwwn> But the aol chat rooms were sort of magical
[08:39:15] <shawwwn> I think I lurked there a lot more than the whole OooOoO Internettttt www craze
[08:39:28] <shawwwn> One fellow asked if I was horny, and I thought that was a bad thing, so I said no
[08:39:29] <gwern> they were ok. IRC was where the real action was, but hard to figure out. I'm not sure aol even allowed IRC connections out
[08:39:43] <rmmh> saturn2: there's a visual novel "Digital: A Love Story" that tries to recreate some of the BBS-era internet feel
[08:40:26] <saturn2> aol definitely allowed irc connections out, and it was a nightmare to try to keep those people banned
[08:41:28] <quanticle> AOL didn't allow any connections out unless you had the more expensive account.
[08:41:30] <gwern> saturn2: aol changed a lot of things over time, unsurprisingly. I'm thinking about when I was stuck on AOL... I don't remember the chronology perfectly. I think I might've only gotten on irc once we switched to proper DSL
[08:41:45] <feep> I don't remember anything about the early internet
[08:41:52] <feep> I think gamefaqs was already there?

He also funded small class sizes before it turned out that all of the research "proving" that small class sizes improved educational attainment was, "As sample sizes get smaller sample variance increases"

[11:29:41] <feep> okay, so we're doing liskovy single inheritance with multiple interfaces
[11:29:50] <feep> single inheritance works like so
[11:30:03] <feep> you have class A. class A starts with vtable pointer, then its data.
[11:30:08] <feep> vtable is just method, method, method.
[11:30:22] <feep> class B inherits A, so B starts with vtable pointer, then A's data, then B's data.
[11:30:34] <feep> B's vtable starts with A's vtable, then B's added methods.
[11:30:49] <feep> so far so simple.
[11:30:58] <shawwwn> rmmh: is that real, or one of those new fangled oldtimey deepfake s
[11:31:02] <feep> now we throw in interfaces. an interface is a list of methods.
[11:31:11] <shawwwn> Why did my phone just correct deepfakes to deepfake s
[11:31:17] <feep> interfaces can inherit from many interfaces
[11:31:23] <feep> classes can inherit from one class and many interfaces
[11:31:35] <feep> hence single inheritance with multiple interfaces
[11:31:47] <shawwwn> Sure
[11:31:50] <feep> okay so
[11:32:00] <feep> when you have B : A, I
[11:32:07] <feep> ie. B inherits A and interface I
[11:32:08] <shawwwn> You have AI
[11:32:18] <shawwwn> Yes I got it
[11:32:32] <feep> the layout of B is, A vtable, then A data, then B data, then *I vtable interface pointer*
[11:32:51] <feep> the vtable interface pointer is just a separate vtable pointer into B's vtable
[11:33:17] <feep> the first entrance in the I vtable pointer, is the *base pointer offset*.
[11:33:21] <shawwwn> I think it’s dumb to say that methods aren’t data, but ok
[11:33:26] <rmmh> shawwwn: yes
[11:33:28] <feep> that's the difference between the vtable interface pointer in B and the start of the class B.
[11:33:38] <shawwwn> rmmh: inclusiveor
[11:33:47] <feep> we need this, because when we call an interface method, we have to call it with a pointer **to B**
[11:33:57] <feep> because every method on an interface is always a method on a class
[11:34:01] <feep> because only classes have methods, right?
[11:34:08] <feep> interfaces don't really exist. only classes exist.

[11:34:43] <shawwwn> But sure
[11:34:45] <feep> it cannot.
[11:34:57] <feep> anyway, so we get the pointer to B by grabbing the interface pointer (ie. the pointer *to* the interface vtable pointer) and subtracting the base offset we find in the vtable.

[11:35:33] <feep> well, I mean, it just can't.
[11:35:39] <feep> the interface has no idea how much data is before its interface pointer.
[11:35:42] <feep> that's required by liskov.
[11:35:43] <shawwwn> It can. Anyway…
[11:35:55] <feep> because B : A, and A has no idea about I
[11:35:58] <feep> so B has to start with A
[11:36:01] <feep> and A can be arbitrarily large.
[11:36:16] <feep> and when you are handed a type I, it has no idea how big B is.
[11:36:32] <feep> (or how big A is.)

[11:37:39] <feep> that is interfaces??
[11:37:44] <feep> I is an interface type
[11:37:49] <feep> you can be passed an I as a parameter
[11:38:10] <feep> an interface is just a list of methods
[11:38:11] <shawwwn> Yes, but as you yourself said, interfaces don’t exist. You can’t pass it as a parameter
[11:38:17] <feep> I mean, in the vtable sense
[11:38:17] <shawwwn> You pass instances
[11:38:29] <feep> interfaces do not have a dedicated vtable or a dedicated allocation.
[11:38:44] <feep> or a method implementation.
[11:38:49] <shawwwn> Correct. Hence, you must have access to B or A or whatever the fuck
[11:38:57] <feep> nono, that's not a requirement in my impl
[11:39:01] <feep> you can have a pointer to an interface.
[11:39:12] <shawwwn> Wtf why
[11:39:15] <shawwwn> But ok
[11:39:17] <feep> cause that's how D does it
[11:39:19] <feep> p much
[11:39:24] <shawwwn> D is a bag of ducks
[11:39:26] <feep> lol
[11:39:33] <feep> anyway, that's why we recover the pointer to B using the base offset.
[11:39:51] <feep> anyway, where it gets fun is if you have interface multiple inheritance.
[11:40:02] <feep> it's easy in classes, you just have multiple interface pointers in sequence.
[11:40:23] <feep> well, no, it's not easy in classes either
[11:40:25] <feep> consider
[11:40:30] <feep> interface I1 { } interface I2 { }
[11:40:33] <feep> interface K : I1, I2 { }
[11:40:40] <feep> class A : K { }
[11:40:52] <feep> this is where "interface slots" come in
[11:41:05] <feep> because A now needs *two* interface pointers to satisfy K
[11:41:24] <feep> because K "occupies two slots" - ie. only I1 is satisfied by Liskov.
[11:41:29] *** Quits: Nivim (~Nivim@184.99.18.117) (Ping timeout: 265 seconds)
[11:41:53] <feep> I call I1 the "primary parent" and I2 and so on "secondary parents". They don't fully participate in some stuff like covariance.
[11:43:09] <feep> anyway, so given an interface, we allocate n slots, where n is basically "the number of secondary parents in the interface hierarchy, plus one".
[11:43:22] <shawwwn> I think all of this complexity is offensive
[11:43:32] <feep> sadly, it can only work like this.

[12:05:48] <rmmh> It is frustrating that they lump in any amount of alcohol up to 2 drinks per day as moderate which honestly isn't all that moderate. Still another way to read that is that while alcohol represents a real risk to community health resources you can mitigate 86% of the risk by limiting yourself to ONLY 68 gallons (257 liters) of beer this year. I would not be terribly surprised if most of the
[12:05:50] <rmmh> issues with moderate drinkers concerned users were on the heavy side of "moderate"

[21:01:30] <two2thehead> "Self-criticism has been identified as a key underlying vulnerability that lowers of one’s positive self-regard and pain barriers that prevent individuals from engaging in non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI). Additionally, research suggests that self-compassion may serve as a protective tool in counteracting self-criticism. This study examined the efficacy of a brief online self-compassion training on past year NSSI engagers and ideators in reducin
[21:01:30] <two2thehead> g (a) explicit self-criticism, (b) implicit self-criticism, (c) pain endurance and (d) the inclination to engage in NSSI. ... p. As compared to the control group (n = 33), the training group (n = 30) yielded significantly greater reduction in explicit self-criticism after a single session and significantly greater reduction in self-criticism, pain endurance, as well as the explicit inclination to self-injure after the one-week online training. The 
[21:01:31] <two2thehead> reduction in explicit self-criticism and inclination to self-injure was maintained at the 2-week follow-up. These findings provide novel evidence supporting the efficacy of using a brief online self-compassion intervention to reduce NSSI correlates and symptoms."

[21:06:30] <two2thehead> "The hypothesized effect of self-compassion training on NSSI engagement is based on a combination of the individual effects of the domains of self-compassion on NSSI motives and cognitions, including reducing self-blaming feelings of isolation, and increasing their acceptance of difficult emotions and personal failures (Heath et al., 2016; Neff, 2016; Trompetter et al., 2017). Working together, each of the domains of self-compassion thus generate a 
[21:06:30] <two2thehead> potentially stronger and more protective barrier against NSSI (K. D. Neff, 2016). As self-criticism has been theorised as a key  vulnerability that lowers the barriers to NSSI engagement (Hooley & Franklin, 2018), self-compassion may constitute an important resource toreduce the benefits associated with NSSI and thus re-build the barriers to NSSI engagement."
