[14:29:48] <Orbstheorem> I think my problem is solved!

[14:30:05] <afontain[m]> yay!
[15:15:41] <artectrex[m]> <Orbstheorem> "I think my problem is solved!" <- how? did you just roll the router dice until you got one that worked or?
[15:19:17] <Orbstheorem> The last fiber box I got is very different from the other ones. The firmware codes look nothing alike.
[15:24:25] <Orbstheorem> Fun fact: the old fiber box had ports 2601 and 2602 open; these ports are oftentimes used by quagga routing suite (RIP, OSPF, BGP, ...). Chances are the router was running a routing daemon and for some reason, my workload would get the routing algorithm confused by sending my packages to the wrong upstream.
[15:24:56] <Orbstheorem> Why would you run routing software in an end-user terminal with a single uplink is still anybody's guess.
[15:25:47] <Orbstheorem> A simple guess is that there are cryptographic keys to guarantee a secure connection to their datacenters through the swiss fiber network.
[15:26:24] <Orbstheorem> In fact, hours after my box was delivered, the old box would stop peering over fiber, forcing me to replace the box.
[15:31:35] <artectrex[m]> Maybe they're running some SCION stuff on the fiber box :P
[15:32:27] <typedef[m]1> Roos: 
[15:32:39] <typedef[m]1> Ups
[15:33:16] <typedef[m]1> An error occured during keyboard mashing
[15:37:53] <Orbstheorem> Is anybody up for playing some modded minecraft after the exams?
[15:40:17] <typedef[m]1> I was playing some frustration because some keys on my keyboard seem to be dying
[15:41:20] <Orbstheorem> Hint: Make a custom layout that only uses keys that work and activate it with `setxkbmap` :P
[15:41:59] <typedef[m]1> x)
[16:01:15] <Orbstheorem> If you want an example: https://gitlab.com/roosemberth/dotfiles/-/blob/prereset-2020/.local/etc/xkb/symbols/Systech13 :P
[16:29:48] <artectrex[m]> <Orbstheorem> "Is anybody up for playing some..." <- I wouldn't mind some minetest if you want :)
[16:30:56] <Orbstheorem> There's a modpack I want to play.
[16:31:14] <Orbstheorem> https://github.com/simibubi/Above-and-Beyond
[16:31:29] <Orbstheorem> If it works in minetest I would prefer minetest.
[16:32:16] <Orbstheorem> Also, I'm surprised this modpack loader provides first-class support for Nix: https://github.com/PolyMC/PolyMC <3
[16:54:17] <artectrex[m]> <Orbstheorem> "There's a modpack I want to play..." <- did you go all the way to nuclear reactor in the modpack that's on the gnugen.ch minetest server?
[16:54:46] <artectrex[m]> hmm which doesn't seem to be working :/
[16:54:54] <artectrex[m]> did we turn it off?
[16:57:58] <Orbstheorem> Haven't played in ages.
[17:04:53] <artectrex[m]> I went all the way to the reactor, so much work required to get all of the uranium mining going etc
[17:05:17] <artectrex[m]> not really worth it, no clue what to do with all of that power
[17:06:02] <artectrex[m]> I mean, it is worth it because it's cool and stuff, but not because of what it gives you
[17:06:17] <afontain[m]> artectrex[m]: In factorio you say that at first, and 3 hours later it is all used
[17:06:34] <artectrex[m]> afontain[m]: yeah but in that mod it's the end of the road
[17:06:56] <afontain[m]> I can definitely see how

[17:12:17] <Orbstheorem> I just restarted my matrix server.
[17:12:17] <Orbstheorem> ~22k requests within 2 minutes: About 8k didn't go through and 14k resolved without issues.
[17:12:17] <Orbstheorem> Given that cache was 4k, I'd call that a successful stress test.
[17:12:17] <Orbstheorem> Seems like my connection problems are gone.
