[19:43:20] <NiLon> there's 3 possibilities: 1. samba server refuses the permissions 2. your client refuses the remote permissions 3. your client refuses the local permissions (of the filesystem)
[19:43:41] <NiLon> if unsure best option is maybe not do any checks on the client

[19:47:15] <NiLon> it becomes important if mounted without unix extensions and the driver isn't doing "real disk" mounting, so permissions are not in sync like what they appear in local fs and what they are in the server

[21:05:58] <superkuh> I believe so.
[21:06:07] <Allie> And what makes it "not good"? 
[21:06:20] <superkuh> Sorry, not as good. Not much headroom versus the new variants.
[21:06:54] <superkuh> Plus, it's DNA carried so involves splicing and mis-splices can happen. Whereas with mRNA vaccines you're already passed that and go directly to protein expression... and don't involve a live virus of any kind.
[21:08:23] <superkuh> To be even more clear: all of the adenovirus vector ones I know of are far less efficient in preventing infection, symptoms, and to a lesser extent, serious disease than the two well known mRNA vaccines.
[21:08:34] <Allie> superkuh: can you point me to any literature which says that's a serious concern? 
[21:08:54] <superkuh> Literature which says being less effective is a serious concern? Are you being serious?
[21:10:05] <Allie> Literature that says DNA mis-splices are a serious concern
[21:10:09] <superkuh> Ah, one sec.
[21:10:23] <superkuh> It's one of theories for why the adenovirus ones have some problems in some very few people.
[21:10:39] <superkuh> Mis-splices leading to missing the basic tail and so becoming soluble.
