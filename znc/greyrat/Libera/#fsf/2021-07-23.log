[00:31:02] <ggoes> the step we're discussing today is how to introduce the concept of "free replacements" to someone, and what some of those replacements might be

[00:31:59] *** Joins: msg75 (~jack@user/msg75)
[00:32:01] <GNUtoo> Hi, is there some sumary of what was discussed last time?
[00:32:01] <ggoes> the first part is i think pretty crucial, but also a little tricky. we don't want a bad experience with a free program to keep them from trying another, and also, don't want to put a ton of pressure on someone to switch (if we're talking about 1:1 advocacy)
[00:32:45] <ggoes> GNUtoo: a few notes on https://libreplanet.org/wiki/Group_talk:Freedom_Ladder; i plan to type up some of the stuff from last week's logs and put them there a little later on
[00:33:06] <GNUtoo> ggoes: I think we should keep the pressure on behavior where people force other people to use nonfree software, and instead focus on helping people to switch to free software if they want
[00:33:06] *** Quits: Emulatorman_ (~andre@81.17.31.49) (Ping timeout: 265 seconds)
[00:33:10] <GNUtoo> Thanks
[00:33:12] <zleap> are we assuming said user is currently running mac / safari or Windows / Edge (or what ever they call the browser now)
[00:33:50] <tpefreedom> most people use chrome
[00:33:52] <tpefreedom> these days
[00:33:59] <zleap> ok
[00:34:01] <urza9814> Are we strictly talking local software or should we include something like NextCloud maybe? Any web stuff brings in the possibility of having it still professionally managed, at least to start, just using an open platform on someone else's cloud....
[00:34:08] <ggoes> zleap: yes; we're talking about someone who has heard about the concept, but hasn't made a switch yet
[00:34:28] <ggoes> urza9814: yeah, i didn't think about that. that's a good suggestion
[00:34:44] <zleap> for cloud get a stack of those, there is no cloud - only someone elses computer stickers / posters
[00:34:49] <zleap> to open up the conversation
[00:34:58] <gilq> A table for "replacements" like the one that there is in the free software directory is a good idea in my opinion: people must be aware of what non-free program there are on their machines. 
[00:35:16] <urza9814> I have a stack of those stickers :) But yeah if there's any service with something like Collabora that could be nice as a google docs alternative
[00:35:35] <GNUtoo> For the "FSF's steps", I'm not sure if it's the right point of view, step 1 (Understanding nonfree software) is right,
[00:35:44] <zleap> it opens up the conversation
[00:35:46] <urza9814> (but it's a bit of a pain to set up yourself)
[00:35:54] <gilq> ggoes about urza9814's idea... there is a talk made in Libreplanet 2021 about a free software data fortress (don't remember the exact name), but we could link to that talk...
[00:36:00] <zleap> well disroot is offering lots of services now
[00:36:02] <ggoes> gilq: oh, that's a good idea
[00:36:03] <lxo> jumping from one SaaSS to another is not really progress, though, is it?
[00:36:21] <GNUtoo> But when someone did step 1, I'm thinking more of a mentality where people would try to free themselves,
[00:36:24] <tpefreedom> Just more of the WWWorst apps
[00:36:33] <ggoes> yeah, i was thinking of the purely "syncing" parts of nextcloud, not any of its document writing capabilities
[00:36:34] <zleap> i think if the altertive offers more freedom than it is a step in the right direction
[00:36:37] <ggoes> i'm not incredibly familiar with it
[00:36:39] <gilq> lxo SaaSS is SaaSS as long as you don't control the machine that's running the server code. If you do, then it's non SaaSS
[00:36:39] <arielcostas> zleap: Disroot and Framasoft (creators of PeerTube) are good
[00:36:51] <GNUtoo> And here the steps don't capture that spirit
[00:37:09] <gilq> But I would keep it simple for the beginning, although a lot of the "programs" (read: applications) come from the web nowadays
[00:37:11] <zleap> the debian nextcloud client works really nicely with disroot too
[00:37:19] <ggoes> GNUtoo: how do you feel about "finding your own reason to use free software?" that's the one that we hope will help give them their own personal motivation to start using more and more
[00:37:28] <urza9814> Eh, it's not a perfect solution but it's a lot better than Google IMO,as long as they aren't building their own proprietary plugins or something
[00:37:32] <zleap> maybe control
[00:37:46] <zleap> if you centralise cloud it is more open to being attacked 
[00:37:50] <lxo> gilq, *nod*.  I'm addressing the "on someone else's cloud" part of the initial argument raised by urza9814 
[00:37:59] <zleap> plus google store a lot of other data again bigger target
[00:38:06] <zleap> less data, less to steal 
[00:38:13] <zleap> not that we should be complacent
[00:38:15] <GNUtoo> ggoes: I'm not saying that the steps are wrong, I'm trying to point out that it also needs to capture something else along the way
[00:38:21] <ggoes> right, i see
[00:38:27] *** Quits: quarkyalice (~quarkyali@user/quarkyalice) (Quit: Leaving)
[00:38:28] <gilq> lxo I see now... sorry, I missed that part.
[00:39:18] <arielcostas> zleap: Or encrypt anything before it leaving your machine. If I have to upload something to Google's "cloud" I previously encrypt it with a GnuPG symmetric key and decrypt it on my machine
[00:39:19] <GNUtoo> ggoes: once people realize the issue, it's more a state of mind (which may or may not include steps, and steps could be different from people to people)
[00:39:27] <ggoes> right
[00:39:29] <zleap> yeah
[00:39:55] <zleap> however i tried to upload items to the disroot lufti service, it worked fine may end but the person at the other end sturggled
[00:40:26] <ggoes> i think lxo raised a good point last week, which is that we don't want to get people dependent on something like google docs to help ease their transition to gnu/linux
[00:40:29] <zleap> it was more sensitive documents (for a job) I didn't want to attach to e-mail but ended up doing that, so we are at the mercy of the recipient in some cases
[00:40:40] <ggoes> so ideally the "free replacements" would be local software, nothing saass
[00:40:43] <zleap> ggoes, yeh
[00:40:43] <tpefreedom> GNUtoo, state of mind, ideology, beliefs, etc ae useful, but most of that usefulness comes from when they inspire action.
[00:41:00] <zleap> well nextcloud and libreoffice integrate
[00:41:13] <zleap> maybe emacs / vi et al need to do the same
[00:41:37] <zleap> gdit so there is save, saveAs and save remote (same for opening files)
[00:41:46] <gilq> ggoes exactly. For now I would list only local applications on the list. Maybe this step can have two "sub steps"
[00:41:47] <tpefreedom> maybe emacs would be a good entry point for someone more technically inclined.
[00:41:58] <lxo> GNUtoo, *nod*, realizing the issues is a key component.  knowing of solutions may then enable steps to be taken sooner
[00:41:58] <GNUtoo> ggoes: It's a bit like if a country wanted to be really free and independent after a war of independence for instance, where companies and other countries do want to exploit the free country weaknesses and dependencies for instance
[00:42:15] <zleap> yeah but my point was this is stil 2021,  why not have cloud integration
[00:42:36] <gilq> So that we can focus on the two problems (local non-free programs and on-the-cloud non-free applications) separately
[00:42:46] <zleap> yeah
[00:42:51] <tpefreedom> GNUtoo, lxo, mindsets are not that useful if they don't translate into action.
[00:43:04] <tpefreedom> Awareness is nice, action is even better.
[00:43:05] <ggoes> also, i think the suggestion would be tailored for the individual person. helping them find something rather than just giving them a list of common programs
[00:43:08] <gilq> zleap of course, why not? But we need to make sure that people don't switch to some SaaSS service they don't have full control on.

[00:43:15] <urza9814> I think there's a difference between being dependent on Google Docs vs being dependent on a paid Nextcloud host...some people want "control" but they would still rather pay someone else to do what they want rather than doing it themselves...and in that case is there really that much of a difference between hiring someone to set up a server on-prem vs paying someone for a cloud instance?

[00:43:44] <zleap> there is managed hosting (e.g mastohost) for the fediverse 
[00:43:46] <ggoes> VLC has always been a go-to for me to suggest to people
[00:43:56] <zleap> so you pay someone to set stuff up and do most of the back end stuff
[00:43:58] <urza9814> I think it's free software or not free software, it's freedom to migrate and federate or being locked in to one vendor...that matters far more than cloud vs local
[00:44:31] <mkulko> i think that at least with a saass that hosts an instance of a software that is licensed, for example, under the agpl, you could at least verify that it isn't doing something malicious unlike google/apple/microsoft cloud services
[00:44:41] <GNUtoo> tpefreedom: what I'm pointing out is that if you're in that mindset, once you realize the issue, you'll definitely make a plan to become free and you'll do the most you can to do that as it's strategic for you and specifically your freedom

[00:44:49] <lxo> cloud integration is most often a source of dependencies.  large organizations may perceive their datacenter as their own cloud, but most people won't think of their home or VSP server as "their cloud"
[00:44:50] <urza9814> (although having said all this, I would probably prefer we generally focus on local stuff where possible, I just think cloud is worth a mention at least)
[00:44:57] <zleap> we need more people with the skills to set these services up
[00:45:08] <tpefreedom> how much of a difference is there between hosting your own nextcloud in a vps vs on prem?
[00:45:15] <lxo> and there's no advantage IMHO of framing their own server as "their cloud"
[00:45:21] <zleap> tpefreedom, probably how much work is involved
[00:45:22] <gilq> mkulko actually... that's not really the case. How can I be sure about it? You can run code A but give me code B.
[00:45:25] <zleap> for a start
[00:45:33] <GNUtoo> tpefreedom: just "follow these steps" isn't enough I think, but Alice has this mindset and did these steps might be way better
[00:45:34] <urza9814> Yeah we absolutely need more people with the skills to set these up...I'd love to see neighborhood cloud services on every block xD
[00:45:44] <lxo> we'd probably be better off framing cloud as freedom-depriving, third-party-controlled computing

[00:46:20] <zleap> lets not tar all cloud services with the same brush
[00:46:23] <arielcostas> tpefreedom: If you have your own computer you can run a fully-free GNU/Linux distro and control absolutely anything. A VPS provider can access the drive or install any programs "to help you manage your machine". The FSF runs Trisquel on their servers if I'm not wrong
[00:46:31] <GNUtoo> tpefreedom: and with that kind of mindset you'd go furthurer than just change the OS, you'd want to get everything 100% free including hardware and even change the architecture of free software to improve power relationships
[00:47:01] <arielcostas> gilq: The Affero GPL prevents that
[00:47:13] <ggoes> i think getting into stuff like VPSes etc is a little beyond the scope of this step, as we're still talking about someone who is not much of a power user
[00:47:18] <gilq> arielcostas only legally I think...
[00:47:32] <zleap> GNUtoo, conversation here earlier finding a bios hwere you ca turn off uefi (or what ever it is) is getting harder
[00:47:41] <GNUtoo> (Example of changing the architecture: moving from client-server model to applications on your computer because it gives you more freedom)
[00:47:41] <zleap> where
[00:47:44] <mkulko> gilq: i mean, yeah, that's a possibility with any server that is physically accessed by someone else, but at least it's far better that google docs.
[00:48:01] <tpefreedom> gilq, so basically "it's only illegal if you get caught" or something like that?
[00:48:04] <zleap> you still need to trust the person hosting
[00:48:14] <zleap> ideally needs to be in the same state / country or juristiction
[00:48:17] <GNUtoo> (Other example: enabling people do do computing their way by using standard (like there are tons of mail clients for instance))
[00:48:19] <ggoes> there are other free programs we could get them to use beyond "free replacements," as well. the step might include info on how to find other free programs -- like mentioning the FSD
[00:48:24] <zleap> e.g uk / eu dgpr
[00:48:38] <zleap> gdpr
[00:49:04] <tpefreedom> Maybe recommend a game like super tux kart.
[00:49:08] <gilq> tpefreedom no, but... how can we say that we do not trust non-free software and then trust an AGPL program on which execution we have no control on?
[00:49:41] <zleap> i think you need to take in to account level of technical knolwedge of that user
[00:49:41] <GNUtoo> zleap: it depends on the constraints you set, globally BIOS compatibility is indeed decrasing, but with free boot software like Libreboot or partially-free boot software like Coreboot, you can at least customize the way your computer boots
[00:49:57] <zleap> ok
[00:49:58] <tpefreedom> You can't fully trust them then. You can only trust what you can understand/control.
[00:50:04] <mkulko> yeah, supertuxkart is awesome! would download and play it even if i didn't know what free software even is
[00:50:19] <lxo> urza9814, answering your earlier question, relying on someone else's cloud instance is worse than running non-free software, freedomwise, even if the software running on someone else's cloud instance is free software
[00:50:41] <ggoes> games can be good to recommend, yeah
[00:50:52] <tpefreedom> super tux kart can also show that free/libre software can have incredibly high quality.
[00:51:00] <zleap> i set up next cloud in a docker instance on a spare PC no issue, my big worry is, is that box secure
[00:51:03] <urza9814> tpefreedom: That's gonna take a few decades of study to use any remotely modern computer then... xD  Ultimately you gotta trust *something* if you wanna get any work done at all...
[00:51:18] <tpefreedom> ig
[00:51:38] <tpefreedom> My point is that you don't really know what a network service is doing if you don't control it.
[00:51:43] <gilq> urza9814 trust free software you have control on.
[00:51:56] <urza9814> zleap: Yeah I think security is gonna be a big issue, maybe we need to look at that further...I think a lot of the reason businesses are moving to the cloud is so they can disclaim liability if anything happens (even though it seems to make problems more likely, they can point the finger at someone else, and they like that)
[00:51:56] <lxo> IMHO if we're to mention cloud at all, it should be as a warning about SaaSS and a recommendation to insist on having control over servers you rely on for your computing
[00:52:49] <PCITechie> ^
[00:53:03] <ggoes> yeah, i think the cloud issues are important to address in some way, but mostly just with a warning like that
[00:53:04] <tpefreedom> Should the fsf/libreplanet wiki hsot a guide somewhere on how to host your own instances of "cloud" type software?
[00:53:12] <urza9814> gilq: Yeah but are you actually reading all of that code? Or are you trusting the FSF/your distro/"the community" to ensure it's all actually safe?
[00:53:42] <ggoes> we don't want to go too far out into the weeds with cloud stuff, as the goal is to get them on an FSDG distro, not necessarily self-hosting services
[00:53:56] <GNUtoo> lxo: indeed and if I apply the thinking I had before, people might also want to have the freedom to decide how they do their computing too (on their laptop, on their servers, in an association of people where they decide collectively, etc)
[00:54:02] <gilq> lxo I agree with you, but at the beginning of the ladder we should keep it simpler. If a person does not know what a server you drop a bomb of information and the person will say "no, it's too complicated". So if it should be on the ladder, give at least its own chapter.
[00:54:23] <ggoes> might be something of a "further reading" / "extra credit" section
[00:54:36] <tpefreedom> ggoes: Not necessarily as part of the freedom ladder. It would just be nice to have one unified resource.
[00:55:25] <tpefreedom> for self-hosting
[00:55:31] <Avron> recommending to use a local software instead of something via a web browser is easily understandable I think
[00:55:49] <lxo> gilq, point of the ladder is that each step increases freedom.  jumping to (third-party) cloud will at best be a no-op, and at worst make them worse off
[00:55:55] <ggoes> yeah, i think so Avron
[00:55:58] *** Quits: Armand (~Armand@user/armand) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[00:56:12] <ggoes> lxo: +1
[00:56:29] <GNUtoo> Avron: it probably depends on the use cases, but the power relationship in SASS and things like that is really what we want to avoid
[00:56:30] <Avron> for file synchronization or sharing though, there is not much solution besides running your own server or using someone else's
[00:56:57] <gilq> lxo wait... I agree with you. I said, if we need to mention self-hosting services on machines that we own... well, it's a rather complex topic and it could deserve a "further reading" section as ggoes has said.
[00:57:19] <lxo> Avron, we have to build P2P solutions for this.  there's no reason to have to rely on third party servers
[00:57:48] <GNUtoo> Avron: there is, look at secure scuttlebut
[00:57:51] <mkulko> Avron: but you could just encrypt the files with free software, or use something like onionshare
[00:58:01] <ggoes> syncthing is a p2p file syncing thing, but like i said, that's probably out of the scope of this step. it might merit a small mention when they're actually switching to gnu/linux, but not this early
[00:58:02] <PCITechie> For streaming services, i'd say they are okay to use if libre, especially because most are decentralised and I dont imagine its easy to collect user data from a decentralised network, but SaaSS is just a hard no
[00:58:04] <gilq> Avron, lxo there is also OnionShare which can share encrypted files via Tor.
[00:58:29] <zleap> trust goes 2 ways 1 i need to trust you to set things up properly but then i have some responsibility to run things locally, run updates etc (even on debian for example)
[00:58:40] <GNUtoo> Avron: it's a network that could replace internet (and can also work within internet) and doesn't even require permanent connections
[00:58:45] <Avron> mkulko: I agree, but I hope there would be a desktop client that does this
[00:59:38] * GNUtoo proposes "Being able to do your own computing the way you want without being trapped in SASS"
[00:59:38] <gilq> ggoes yes, let's keep it simple and replace popular non-free programs with free ones in this step, being sure to avoid SaaSS "solutions" (are these solutions to begin with?)
[00:59:50] <ggoes> GIMP & Inkscape are good suggestions for this step, i think
[00:59:59] <zleap> eyeah
[01:00:23] <zleap>  and graphics magic (great for batch processing of lots of files)
[01:00:27] <gilq> but also mention the SaaSS problem. So maybe... and I say maybe... we can, for now, put SaaSS at the same level of a proprietary program (ex. Google Docs = MS word)
[01:00:28] <tpefreedom> ggoes, also krita
[01:00:30] <PCITechie> krita
[01:00:45] <gilq> ggoes Blender
[01:00:48] <urza9814> I'm a big fan of OpenSCAD if we're gonna get as specific as CAD tools...although that's not really a traditional CAD tool either...
[01:00:53] <ggoes> for sure
[01:00:54] <zleap> i would also suggest programs that are easy to spell / pronounce
[01:01:11] <lxo> a GNUnet drive where you could store your (encrypted) files and access them from any of your computers would be nice to have, but...  I think this just goes to show how much of a tangent to the original topic the conversation about cloud is.  shall we refocus on recommendations of software to run on computers under the user's control?
[01:01:26] <tpefreedom> for video editing, shotcut or kdenlive. (I prefer shotcut but a lot of people in the broader community seem to prefer kdenlive.)
[01:01:32] <Avron> GNUtoo: thanks for the suggestion, so far I use seafile on my own machine, it has the benefit of having clients for all commlon desktop and mobile OSs
[01:01:39] <zleap> there is openshot
[01:01:58] <ggoes> also, something that would be useful to focus on in this step is helping the user learn how to *find* free software; the FSD can be a core part of that, and that way, they can follow their own interests. so if they're an engineer etc, they might stumble upon openscad or octave like urza9814 suggests
[01:02:10] <zleap> but kdenlive is a nice package
[01:02:11] <PCITechie> tpefreedom: agreed about shotcut, when I tried kdenlive it was unstable (compared to shotcut, overall it was okay)
[01:02:13] <mkulko> ggoes: yeah, just programs that most people need and that demonstrate that free software is there and it isn't worse than proprietary stuff i think would be good as an introduction
[01:02:21] <ggoes> right
[01:02:33] <urza9814> Yeah definitely need ways to find software, we can't possibly recommend for every niche....
[01:02:34] <zleap> i have older hardware so some programs install fine then refuse to run
[01:02:45] <ggoes> right urza9814
[01:02:48] <gilq> ggoes there are free software repositories like the Trisquel ones... and the FSD is nice.
[01:02:52] <tpefreedom> zleap, an x200?
[01:02:54] <zleap> so like i said last time,  what are the users needs
[01:03:01] <urza9814> Add handbrake for video tools, great for coversion or ripping of DVDs, seems to be fairly easy for new users too
[01:03:07] <lxo> ggoes, +1  empowering users to find their own freedom is a very important part of the solution, even if some common recommendations are probably important and useful to get them started
[01:03:12] <ggoes> it may be worth it to teach them skills on how to find free software for nonfree OSes, and then when they are using gnu/linux, say that the instructions we gave them before are mostly the same, except they're looking within their distro's tools now
[01:03:14] <zleap> well i have intel grapnics so some programs struggle
[01:03:21] <GNUtoo> Here too I think that showing how it could be done and what is achieve is a good idea, giving specific examples, but keeping them as examples
[01:03:35] <ggoes> right GNUtoo
[01:03:41] <zleap> but I know my PC / Hardware and don't assume others understand why soemthing doesn't work isn't always down to the program 
[01:03:54] <GNUtoo> And here we could probably add something, because many people already use free software without knowing it
[01:04:02] <urza9814> Yeah I think it's much harder to find free software on non-free OSes, when you don't have repos to browse and just have to check random websites... :)
[01:04:17] *** Joins: Armand (~Armand@user/armand)
[01:04:27] <PCITechie> also because they wouldnt have heard of the programs names, people could consider them shady and not touch them
[01:04:29] <zleap> i woould guess a lot of people just use the stores now to get software
[01:04:52] <zleap> PCITechie, the fedvierse suffers the same issue
[01:05:00] <ggoes> the ideal progression is, i think, using one free (local) program, plus more, plus more, and then switching over to gnu/linux and using all of the same programs that they grew accustomed to on their nonfree OS. it won't always work out so perfectly, but that would be an easy transition
[01:05:01] <urza9814> Should we recommend something like F-Droid for Android users?
[01:05:15] <zleap> ggoes, +1
[01:05:26] <zleap> urza9814, sure
[01:05:28] <gilq> urza9814 I think this is a topic for the 3rd or 4th freedom ladder meeting
[01:05:42] <gilq> *it's been planned in the 3rd or 4th...
[01:05:57] <lxo> shall we mention repos for mobile OSs?  there's f-droid for one of the popular systems, but the other is so locked down and the app store is so restraining that IIUC it's not even *possible* to make Free Software available as such for that OS
[01:06:01] <zleap> i would still argue however that we need to bare in mind if people need support who is going to provide that, esp if they work full time, have a family and the other person wants something fixed
[01:06:09] <urza9814> gotcha, didn't see that mobile was a separate thing
[01:06:14] <GNUtoo> And if we give examples, we could give very diverse examples, like a free web browser like iceweasel or firefox which also fight backs against Google's control over the web, or Alice who install a program to fill a strategic use case where her work depends on it and she don't want to assure to still be able to use that program in the future
[01:06:35] <ggoes> right lxo, determining what to suggest when it comes to iOS is going to be difficult. but f-droid would be something to suggest for android users
[01:06:40] <GNUtoo> s/don't want/wants/
[01:07:23] <zleap> * they meaning you or I who suggested the software may be expected to support
[01:07:41] <ggoes> we never want to encourage someone to buy new hardware just to *try* something; when they're stable and have settled on freedom, then we can introduce things like that. although in the mobile phone step we'll certainly be mentioning that "true" mobile OS freedom isn't currently possible
[01:07:44] <gilq> ggoes a list of mantained free programs can be built from scratch just for the purpose of the ladder
[01:08:19] <zleap> pine phone,. rep;icant,  with libhandy progress is beingmade
[01:08:29] <GNUtoo> Or we could even give examples for new uses cases, like Zora has just started activism and needs a software to publish a politically oriented fanzine for instance
[01:08:36] <lxo> one issue to keep in mind when recommending free software for non-free OSs is that there are web sites that offer Free Software binaries ridden with malware.  helping users identify and steer away from those, and to seek trustworthy sources instead, is probably an important part of the recommendations
[01:08:41] <mkulko> android also likes to scare users when installing not from google play, so i think we'll also need to say something like "f-droid is safe, you can install it".
[01:09:09] <GNUtoo> mkulko: I turn that backward, "google doesn't check what f-droid does => Good..."
[01:09:16] <zleap> or someone has started a science / maths degree and needs a program to correctly type set formulae etc, (e.g LaTeX)
[01:09:33] <zleap> we can offer a whole package there, software, + support,+ forums etc
[01:09:34] <GNUtoo> lxo: for mobile OS I'm not sure, it's a can of worms,
[01:09:37] <lxo> that's a way to plug free software distros, since lots of useful packages are preinstalled or available from trusthworthy repos
[01:09:39] <zleap> as that structure is there
[01:09:44] <GNUtoo> *for mobile applications
[01:09:48] <urza9814> GNUtoo: I think highlighting the diverse nature of the options is a great idea...to most people IE and Firefox and Chrome are all basically the same thing, we can show that there are browsers (for example) that are really different, and that's interesting at least :)
[01:10:19] *** Joins: OMYasuda (~OMYasuda@177.62.168.87)
[01:10:32] <zleap> urza9814, or one is a backup to the other,   i can't get Scratch 3 to work on Firefox it works on Chrome so having more than 1 browser is kinda handy for that reason
[01:10:37] <GNUtoo> lxo: f-droid is not FSDG compliant and I still need to look if the f-droid client can easily be compiled with only free software
[01:11:08] <lxo> GNUtoo, I was mostly thinking of LibreOffice for Windows.  I've got reports of malware-ridden versions of that in sites often found by web searches
[01:11:27] <GNUtoo> lxo: well, in that case we tell about that, like "be careful"
[01:11:30] <ggoes> yeah lxo, good point. we'll need to be careful about where we send people to look for binaries
[01:11:39] <urza9814> Yeah definitely need to link to the official sites, that'll help with support concerns too probably
[01:11:45] <zleap> https://developer.android.com/license
[01:11:55] <zleap> license for android studio
[01:12:02] <GNUtoo> lxo: that could be a good argument for GNU/Linux, and point the limits with such approach
[01:12:10] <lxo> funny how free software repos are such a solved problem when it comes to gnu/linux, and such a mess for proprietary systems
[01:12:15] *** Quits: RedSoxFan07 (~Thunderbi@d-159-250-218-50.ct.cpe.atlanticbb.net) (Ping timeout: 265 seconds)
[01:12:16] <ggoes> yeah
[01:12:43] <zleap> we ahve more experience
[01:12:46] <urza9814> lxo: Funny how they seem to be getting *un-solved* on gnu/linux lately...but that's a different discussion lol
[01:12:54] <mkulko> lxo: yeah, especially here in russian-speaking countries i've had even my relatives who searched "free office app" or alike and then got ransomware
[01:12:55] <lxo> urza9814, so true :-(
[01:12:57] <zleap> look at debian, repositories where there years before we had the play store etc
[01:13:50] <GNUtoo> Example: Lewis is are not reay yet to switch to free distributions, and he installed Libreoffice to make sure that his document will stay readable with free software, but as windows doesn't check the provenance of the applications he downloaded Libreoffice straight from the libreoffice website
[01:13:55] <zleap> it works as there is a good process to vet software going in,  transparancy as to why it is not going in or going in to the repo
[01:13:58] <GNUtoo> *s/are//
[01:14:35] <ggoes> on the other hand, mentioning that danger is a good plug for gnu/linux. we warn them about that problem, but get to mention that it doesn't happen on gnu/linux distros :)
[01:14:50] <GNUtoo> Though it could be improved a lot as we want to not push people toward having windows / OSX control the applications being run
[01:14:56] <zleap> ggoes, or less likely to happen
[01:15:12] <ggoes> right, not impossible, but much much less likely
[01:15:27] <zleap> partly as a lot of people hse apple / MS 
[01:15:29] <urza9814> GNUtoo: Good text, although I'd also caution that you can't necessarily tell the "official" site just by looking at it...even something dumb like checking Wikipedia is probably a good enough way to go though :)
[01:15:37] <GNUtoo> So maybe "as Lewis doesn't trust windows and third parties, he went straight to the libreoffice website"
[01:15:39] <gilq> zleap and even much less likely to happen in FSDG distributions (we could raise the point about avoiding Ubuntu, for instance)
[01:15:40] *** Joins: labrax (~seabass@user/seabass)
[01:15:47] <zleap> if linux gains bigger desktop / mobile share it will be a target
[01:16:11] <zleap> gilq, but yes,  important not to be complacent
[01:17:56] <zleap> maybe we need to work on more people switching to the fediverse,  there is far less support for MS / APple there
[01:18:10] <GNUtoo> gilq: we could do that by telling the tradeoffs made: Alexander installed Fedora because he had a graphic card that wasn't supported yet by linux-libre, he will try to get a RYF compliant laptop later on
[01:18:19] <zleap> so any promo we do on there, will be seen and not picked up and over ridden by ads for closed products
[01:18:23] <ggoes> yeah, i like that GNUtoo
[01:18:34] <lxo> I wonder if mentioning that trusting third parties, even gnu/linux or official upstream packagers, is something that can be improved on later, with local / reproducible builds and code audits.  just to avoid promoting blind trust, and enable users to see that it's not just a switch from trusting one party to trusting another
[01:18:36] *** Quits: OMYasuda (~OMYasuda@177.62.168.87) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[01:18:51] <tejr> The Fediverse is wonderful and somewhat underrated I feel by free software advocates and those looking for alternative social media
[01:18:54] <mkulko> GNUtoo: or maybe direct people to the FSD and say that links to the free software websites found there can be trusted?
[01:19:04] <GNUtoo> lxo: indeed, trust is a lot about processes in such complicated world
[01:19:13] <zleap> what is needed for the fediverse is a good reason to be there
[01:19:23] <tejr> However it has some glaring problems that are not technical but social
[01:19:23] <GNUtoo> mkulko: indeed that could work too
[01:19:25] <zleap> so provide something that unless you are there, you WILL simply miss out
[01:19:32] <tejr> And are not easily fixed
[01:19:58] <Avron> urza9814: I am using abrowser but I honestly fail to see any difference with Firefox
[01:19:59] <zleap> only sharing a video on peertube will get federated to mastodon for example
[01:20:12] <gilq> GNUtoo I agree on that, but at least recommend non-FSDG distros that separate free and non-free software such as Debian
[01:20:15] <gilq> Or gentoo
[01:20:25] <gilq> Ok, maybe not gentoo
[01:20:40] <PCITechie> yeah no dont recommend gentoo to a new user
[01:20:46] <zleap> i agree there
[01:20:53] <zleap> Mint is beginner friendly
[01:20:54] <tejr> Definitely not
[01:21:00] <Armand> Mint is love. <3
[01:21:18] <gilq> PCITechie sorry, gentoo and debian are the two only distributions that I know that separates free and non-free software in their repositories
[01:21:24] <tpefreedom> I thought we were mostly talking about individual programs. Did I miss something?
[01:21:38] <tejr> WiFi working out of the box remains a huge problem in recommending distros to new people
[01:21:47] <zleap> i agree there
[01:21:48] <GNUtoo> We could even have stories like Sarah tried to switch to gimp 10 years ago, but it didn't work out for her as gimp didn't support 16bit colors that she needed for her work (she's a photograph), and she tried again 5 years ago when they added support for that feature, and now she has managed to get rid of nonfree photo editing software completely
[01:21:58] <PCITechie> tpefreedom: yeah actually, isn't this the last topic we are talking about?
[01:22:06] <ggoes> we definitely want to hype FSDG distros as much as possible. but at the same time, since it's a progression, it's fine for people to use less acceptable gnu/linux distros as a waypoint on their journey to the FSDG distros. as otherwise they might burnout altogether because of a hardware incompatibility
[01:22:23] <mkulko> gliq: Debian is quite hard to install too for a new user that has no idea how to use the gnu utilities or configure everything or what are 'disk partitions' 
[01:22:32] <GNUtoo> Here it would show that the same free software evolves and that it might be interesting to try again later on if it doesn't work
[01:22:42] <ggoes> good point GNUtoo
[01:22:47] <tejr> You can provide them something where the wifi doesnt work, which disappoints them enormously right off the bat, or install e.g. debian with nonfree firmware, which is to many an unacceptablr compromise
[01:22:51] <GNUtoo> We could even have someone who tries the wrong software and then finds the perfect software
[01:23:00] <zleap> I am sure we could find a lot of 'good' examples of people using free software
[01:23:01] <PCITechie> mkulko: isnt that the setup for pretty much all distributions though?
[01:23:19] <lxo> GNUtoo, presenting the ideas as such stories seems like a fine idea

[01:23:37] *** Quits: OMYasuda (~OMYasuda@177.62.168.87) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[01:23:38] <zleap> i think we can find a few stories from our own experiences
[01:23:40] <gilq> mkulko Debian difficult to install?
[01:23:42] <urza9814> I've had to help software engineers get through the WIndows installer....anything is hard if you've never installed an OS before...
[01:23:55] <zleap> agreed
[01:24:08] <ggoes> yeah zleap, funny you mention that, but the start of this project was our collecting a lot of "how i got into free software" stories from people we knew to find common threads
[01:24:11] <lxo> PCITechie, the stories can be fictional; the names stand for personas that users can identify with.  though real stories can be nice too
[01:24:12] <GNUtoo> It gives a lot of advantages: we can show diversity, it's not authoritarian, we can tell why this (real or fake) person did that and what are the drawbacks if any, etc
[01:24:14] <arielcostas> Newbie-friendly distros like mint offer you to set up the partitions for you: you can tell it to dualboot to Losedows and it will partition the disk correctly. Or to just wipe everything and add a root partition for GNU/Linux
[01:24:15] <ggoes> *because the start
[01:24:16] <zleap> or how free software has helped people fix computers
[01:24:20] <zoe> It would be even better if they were real stories, I am sure we can at least find some (hi everyone! I've been multitasking, but catching up on the reading) 
[01:24:29] <ggoes> so i like the idea of having a lot of stories
[01:24:32] <ggoes> fictional or not

[01:24:52] <ggoes> hi zoe
[01:24:54] <tpefreedom> arielcostas, losedows, lol xd
[01:25:10] <ggoes> i only heard "losedows" for the first time comparatively recently
[01:25:17] <tejr> <urza9814> I've had to help software engineers get through the WIndows installer  # I switched my work PC to Debian recently and for the first time since I could remember spent much *less* time setting everything up than I normally have to on a new Windows install
[01:25:20] <zleap> e.g a friend had a problem a few years ago(internet) he was running windows, I booted a kanotix live cd, that works fine,  so it ruled out hardware issues and pointed back to windows,  told tech support the put me on to MS told them the same and they helped fix it
[01:25:25] <mkulko> gilq: i mean with trisquel its simply booting off of a usb and following instructions, in debian it's not the frendliest installer and for example installing the blobs for gpus can be very hard
[01:25:30] * TheBlueWizard notes that the installing the OS requires knowing a few things and understanding a few things, regardless of the OS being installed
[01:25:55] <GNUtoo> TheBlueWizard: install parties can help a lot with that
[01:25:56] <tejr> zleap: The LiveCD test is I feel underrated, it's really important as it tells you so much about what will and won't work, and is a harmless way for people to try stuff out
[01:25:59] <zleap> i think debian is fine for a single install on a hard disk,  dual boot could be more tricky
[01:26:01] <arielcostas> tpefreedom: People that use that OS abbreviate them as "win", but I consider running Microsoft Windows to be a lose instead of a win, so I call it Losedows
[01:26:22] <zleap> tejr, yeah but this is also a good example on how doing that helped fix or dianose a problem
[01:26:37] <tejr> zleap: Right
[01:26:53] <urza9814> Yeah, Live setups are fantastic, and it's a cool trick that you can't easily do with anything else, something most people haven't seen before
[01:27:08] <zleap> We called the ISP up and Microsoft,  both I guess may have been relieved we were user + clue
[01:27:10] <ggoes> yeah, i've found people still get impressed by live USBs even though it's 2021, haha
[01:27:16] <urza9814> I mean technically you can with Windows I think but it's not easy (and possibly a license violation?)
[01:27:18] <tejr> urza9814: If you can show them a browser and an office suite installed automatically, that impresses a lot of people
[01:27:23] * TheBlueWizard notes that there used to be many install parties, but they seem to have vanished....
[01:27:25] <zleap> this was back when MS considered Linux to be a cancer and uber evil
[01:27:29] <gilq> mkulko If the computer does not need any nonfree package, then I found debian pretty easy to install. Besides, the installation is a one-time process and it's not the easiest thing you can think of in any case, so better pointing this out is a good idea.
[01:27:33] <madage> I'm unsure if it's appropriate for today or for the meeting on august, but what do you think about suggesting wine to run nonfree software that the user considers a "must have" but which are not available on GNU?
[01:27:42] <tejr> Especially if they're used LibreOffice before (lots of those; hate Office so using LibreOffice, but not even aware there are other OS options)
[01:27:48] <ggoes> madage: i'm not sure we want to do that
[01:27:56] <PCITechie> I'm sure MS still considers GNU and Linux cancers
[01:27:56] <lxo> urza9814, live systems can also be an impressive feature for users who haven't seen anything like that before
[01:28:02] <ggoes> compromise is one thing, but that might be taking things a little far
[01:28:02] <PCITechie> they are just more subtle about it
[01:28:03] <tpefreedom> I got into using a lot of free software programs not because of the freedom issue initially, which I learned about later, but because they were usually gratis. I only discovered the larger freedom issue later on when I started trying out gnu/linux on a laptop with a failing hdd, which is also where I discovered a passion for IT suff.
[01:28:08] <tpefreedom> *stuff
[01:28:10] <zleap> madage, kinda as some people need some software for workflow, e.g zoom
[01:28:15] <tejr> TheBlueWizard: The good news is I think it's in part because it got a lot easier.  The bad news is that install parties don't work for phones at all, and people use phones much more now
[01:28:18] <mkulko> arielcostas: "compiled with msvc for lose32" :D
[01:28:26] <urza9814> madage: Not sure it's appropirate for this topic, but interesting thing about wine is it's also often able to run older Windows programs that won't run on modern Windows...so that can get people switched over by itself sometimes....
[01:28:40] <madage> I've often found people unwilling to move to GNU because of dependency on some software (work related sometimes) and not because they didn't like free replacements for ordinary tasks
[01:28:45] <zleap> i installed zoom on snap yesterday to join a careers fair, as Firefox + zoonm Web works but didn't display the presenters presentation at all
[01:28:55] <TheBlueWizard> tejr: Point made!
[01:28:56] <arielcostas> mkulko: you can still call it Windows, but you shouldn't abbreviate as "win"
[01:29:21] <lxo> ggoes, perhaps mentioning it at higher steps of the latter, like, when you'd like to switch over to a free distro but think you can't because of some legacy program
[01:29:25] <GNUtoo> madage: here we don't need to suggest that, we could say Bob has switch to GNU/Linux but still uses <that nonfree software that is on the high priority list> for his work and is willing to try any free software replacements and help as he can (he's not a programmer though).
[01:29:29] <tpefreedom> I've also heard winblows
[01:29:31] <ggoes> good point lxo
[01:29:34] <PCITechie> madage: isn't there a tool now that seamlessly integrates MS Windows programs in a VM with your GNU/Linux desktop?
[01:29:41] <zleap> however you can then use Zoom to invite people to big blue button or jitsi
[01:29:42] <gilq> madage but the entire reason to switch to a free OS is... to have freedom. I get that the OS is an important part of a computer, but having nonfree software installed in it would make void all the efforts for freedom
[01:29:42] <PCITechie> can't remember what its called tho
[01:29:54] <tejr> madage: I was excited to read the "freedom ladder" idea because I feel that the FSF being explicit/consistent about doing even a little is a really important and practical message: taking one step, replacing one nonfree program, refusing to use Facebook for a meeting just once, etc
[01:29:57] <zleap> PCITechie, well snaps can do that
[01:30:01] <arielcostas> madage: Adobe and MS Office are usually required (apparently, GIMP, Inkscape, KDEnlive, LibreOffice et al don't exist)
[01:30:14] <tejr> The FSF has an image outside of its loyalists as being obsessive and impractical, quite unfairly
[01:30:22] <ggoes> yeah tejr, i'm excited to be doing it
[01:30:30] *** Joins: OMYasuda (~OMYasuda@177.62.168.87)
[01:30:31] <gilq> The only "compromise" that was mentioned here was the one for nonfree firmwares to avoid striking the user with "you need to change your machine to have freedom and you cannot even try it before!".
[01:30:35] <mkulko> TheBlueWizard: even worse, i have an acer brand laptop where secure boot is forcibly turned on and win 10 home preinstalled, no way to turn it off
[01:30:36] <PCITechie> zleap: they can run Windows programs in a VM and integrate them?
[01:30:49] <zleap> could do
[01:31:03] <TheBlueWizard> mkulko: Ouch!
[01:31:07] <tpefreedom> PCITechie, wine
[01:31:07] <zleap> out of interest on all this, how do we deal with WSL which is Windows subsystemfor linux
[01:31:09] <madage> PCITechie: I don't know, is there ?
[01:31:17] <zleap> so allowing linux apps to run inside windows
[01:31:38] <ggoes> tejr: some recent writings of rms on the same topic https://gnu.org/philosophy/saying-no-even-once.html
[01:31:40] <PCITechie> tpefreedom: I was more referring to programs that need a VM to run, as they don't work under wine
[01:31:46] <zleap> in some ways that removes the need to install a pure linux OS, so makes our job mich harder when that exists
[01:32:10] <PCITechie> madage: there is a program that does it, can't remember its name of the top of my head though, and its 100% not snap
[01:32:12] <lxo> gilq, it's all consistent with taking steps towards freedom.  the trick is to offer awareness and steer towards freedom rather than away from it or presenting compromises as solutions
[01:32:13] <zleap> vm could be overkill as you need to boot the guest OS then run your program
[01:32:15] <GNUtoo> mkulko: so you need to use a distribution that boots with secure boot, and then you can change the microsoft keys with yours if you really want, ideally we could have public keys that distros uses to "disable" secure boot...
[01:32:20] <tpefreedom> zleap, wsl still isn't great for GUIs
[01:32:21] <ggoes> lxo: +1
[01:32:23] <tejr> I think one really big factor here is patience, too.  Because the kind of people who are having this chat love free software, they want the people they like to have that freedom too, but it's really easy to scare people off with something that ultimately doesn't work for them.  One of the reasons the Freedom Ladder idea appeals to me is because the successes I've had in helping people with free software have 
[01:32:23] <urza9814> PCITechie: IIRC, VirtualBox has a "seamless" mode, it still runs a desktop kinda but hides the background and stuff
[01:32:26] <gilq> mkulko OUCH OUCH OUCH! Which model is it? Maybe we could list them all in order to tell the new users "please don't buy this if you're interested in your freedom" (I would do this independently from the ladder)
[01:32:29] <tejr> almost always been solving just one often-small problem they're having with just one proprietary program by replacing it.
[01:32:37] <zleap> PCITechie, playonLinux
[01:32:43] <tejr> ggoes: I love that "saying no even once" article and I wish the FSF stressed that message somewhat more
[01:32:47] <ggoes> mkulko: i've heard that happening recently; a disturbing trend
[01:32:53] <PCITechie> zleap: playonlinux uses wine..
[01:32:56] <ggoes> tejr: yeah, that's what we're aiming to do here
[01:32:56] <zleap> ok
[01:32:59] <ggoes> but i agree
[01:33:01] <zleap> crossover
[01:33:02] <tejr> It seems that even a lot of people who have been interested in free software for a long time don't know about this
[01:33:14] <zleap> yeah there is a distro that is basically linux that runs windows
[01:33:19] <gilq> lxo You aren't talking about the wine option to run nonfree software, aren't you? 
[01:33:21] <madage> arielcostas: if there is a clear cut replacement, I wouldn't suggest it, but I understand sometimes the user is reliant on some features which are missing on the replacement... one software that some user said was a must have was photoshop (adobe)
[01:33:26] <GNUtoo> tejr: + we can show that sometimes it might not work and give possible solutions for that
[01:33:34] <zleap> i know what you mean, just can't remember the name of it (which hits another nail on the head there)
[01:33:35] <tejr> ggoes: I'm really glad to hear it
[01:34:05] <ggoes> madage: i think that's true, but we should still encourage them to try and find out for themselves. the programs improve enough to where that photoshop feature that gimp might not have had in 2012, it does in 2021
[01:34:08] <arielcostas> madage: They are usually required by their companies for the "adobe cloud" thing, and because they are paying it already
[01:34:31] <tejr> GNUtoo: Yes absolutely, and what I mostly mean about patience is that after you've helped them switch to something, *wait*, even in some cases if they're excited too
[01:34:53] <tejr> This takes time
[01:34:57] <mkulko> gilq: It's an Aspire 3, i found a tutorial where you need to set a bios password to enable changing secure boot settings, however i did that and they are still grayed out
[01:35:00] <madage> gilq: yes, that's why I've asked for your opinion, on the other hand, maybe if there is only one such software in the beggining, the experience with free software will in the long run create the aversion/diwgust to keep using it
[01:35:14] <madage> instead of trying to persuade beforehand

[01:35:23] <zleap> PCITechie, https://reactos.org/
[01:35:30] <ggoes> GNUtoo: yeah. that's why we made "learning how to find help" its own step on the ladder. being able to search for solutions for yourself whether in manpages or forums is extremely important to staying with gnu/linux
[01:35:32] <lxo> gilq, I am indeed.  to *keep* on running legacy software is the framing I'm thinking of
[01:35:40] <madage> ggoes: sure thing!
[01:35:46] <lxo> (which would otherwise prevent you from switching to gnu/linux)
[01:35:47] <urza9814> There are some features Photoshop has gotten years after the GIMP already had them too though (Resynthesizer plugin was one IIRC)...so that kind of stuff can go both ways, people need to give the alternative a fair shot and they might find reasons to use it even if it's missing some feature that they think they need...
[01:35:48] <PCITechie> zleap: that can run even less programs than wine and good luck getting it running outside a VM
[01:36:06] <zleap> i am not sure what you were thinking of then
[01:36:11] <GNUtoo> We could even have things like that: Gwendolyn is a programmer that siwtched to GNU/Linux. She never managed to use office suites like Microsoft office or Libreoffice, and at some point she discovered LaTex to write documents
[01:36:24] <GNUtoo> So here you can show that it can take time to find the right software
[01:36:26] <tejr> ggoes: Something I feel is often overlooked in the "search the web for help" thing is that free software people who are used to this often overestimate the ability or willingness of the general public to filter useful information from bad information
[01:36:39] <ggoes> tejr: good point
[01:36:45] <urza9814> tejr: +1
[01:36:52] <GNUtoo> So you decouple the switch to free software with the finding the right software

[01:39:58] <lxo> as for finding help...  it's often useful to have friends/acquaintances whom you can rely on.  there might be a 12-yo gnu/linux hacker in the neighborhood, and they might be glad to help you out.  recommending online communities where you can make acquaintances that can help you out is good; also imparting the understanding that, once you've learned some of this stuff, it's just right for you to stick around and pass it on to the next newbie.  -> don't just 
[01:39:58] <lxo> take from community, help make it better
[01:40:13] <tejr> GNUtoo: It's in part intimidation; I'm not scared of computers because I've been doing this stuff for so long, and computers-for-computers' sake, just because it was cool.  That is not most people's experience
[01:40:16] <ggoes> definitely
[01:40:23] <urza9814> Yeah I didn't *really* learn to use Bash until I took a Unix course in college, even though I had been using Linux for about five years at that point. But didn't know awk, sed, barely even understood shell scripting really....that one class quite literally changed my life haha

[01:40:43] <ggoes> one doesn't even need to be finished with the ladder to help another person get to where they themselves are on it

[01:40:54] <ggoes> peer learning
[01:41:07] <mkulko> GNUtoo: yeah, i installed what i believed to be just 'Linux' at the time only because it seemed cool that i can pick a desktop enviroment and have a package manager and stuff like that
[01:41:23] <zleap> yeah, I am sort of working on peerlearning project for distance learning
[01:41:31] <GNUtoo> tejr: it also depends on the people, for some people it's just a tool and their main interest is not computers, for other you teach them the very basics of the command line to solve a problem and they ask you where to find tutorials to completely learn it
[01:41:34] <tejr> ggoes: If I got a relative to install LibreOffice and they loved it and told five of their friends who also did it, I consider that a far bigger win than trying to get a relative to use Ubuntu and them just getting confused and ignoring it
[01:41:43] <ggoes> i agree
[01:41:57] <tejr> GNUtoo: Both of which are OK, and the latter is how we get new hackers (enormously important)
[01:42:03] <ggoes> what counts is instilling the philosophy / values
[01:42:12] <zleap> i think till this pendemic is over,  we are kinda stuck, so should brainstorm and come up with a really good strategy
[01:42:19] <urza9814> Yeah online communities can be intimidating, a lot of people would rather have someone to ask one-on-one, or would prefer to do it verbally instead of in text, need to make sure we don't imply that forums or something are teh only place to get help, even if it's just "hey, maybe you can try your favorite social network too, maybe there's a local LUG, etc..."
[01:42:27] <GNUtoo> tejr: indeed but in some projects having people who know how to draw is far more important like with wesnoth
[01:42:48] <GNUtoo> tejr: so both might be enormously important
[01:43:07] <tejr> urza9814: Agreed but I'm thinking mostly in terms of not just trusting someone to tell you what *software* both respects your freedom and is useable for your daily tasks, but also trusting someone to tell you *where to get help* (you know, if you're not around...)
[01:43:48] <tejr> "search Google" is just not good enough (quite apart from not being DDG)
[01:43:56] <zleap> this is where local user groups are helpful
[01:44:06] <zleap> tejr, search duckduckgo 
[01:44:15] <tpefreedom> tejr, what about searx, or yacy?
[01:44:16] <tejr> zleap: That's the joke ;)
[01:44:20] <zleap> ok
[01:44:22] <tejr> tpefreedom: Love SearX
[01:44:23] <lxo> *nod*, we don't want people to abide by  such advice as "just enable the non-free repo" without understanding the implications :-)
[01:44:29] <psydroid> I think it also depends to what extent your skills depend on featires of proprietary software when you got into contact with free software
[01:44:35] <urza9814> tejr: Yeah, I was more thinking of how do you find the person to tell you that, although I guess if someone is on the freedom ladder, someone else probably got them there :)
[01:44:45] <zleap> you could explain you have doen that, why and the negatives of that
[01:44:53] <zleap> neccessary evil to get wifi working for example
[01:45:02] <zleap> solution is to lobby for more open hardware
[01:45:03] <tejr> psydroid: Enormously so, yes.  From my own relatives' experience: for graphic designers, it feels nigh-impossible, though it probably isn't.  Massive uphill climb to get out of Adobe's clutches

[01:46:00] <GNUtoo> So understanding the tradeoffs is really important with help and so on
[01:46:00] <tejr> That makes me think of another thing; often, Free Software doesn't come in single giant programs or "suites" to do things, but several different independent programs that can be used more or less in concert with open formats etc
[01:46:04] <zleap> a lot of people HAVE to use them as part of their job,  they would rather not but have no chouce

[01:47:04] <zleap> i think photoshop is more for say photography, so if you understand photography itmakes using photoshop easier due to the vocabulary
[01:47:07] <urza9814> tejr: Yes..."unix philosophy" can apply to more than just shell tools, might be worth explaining in some simplified form about stringing multiple tools together because you have the freedom to do so
[01:47:20] <mkulko> good thing that the only modern hardware component that requires non-free software or blob to function are modern gpus with amd/nvidia duopoly
[01:47:23] <lxo> GNUtoo, heh, that gave me an idea to promote questioning such "common wisdom" in pursuit of freedom: having stories in which someone suggests "common [proprietary] wisdom" and our character clicks on "I disagree" :-)
[01:47:35] <ggoes> haha, i like that
[01:47:41] <lxo> (several of these could make the point)
[01:47:45] <psydroid> I learned Photoshop 5.0 and those skills transferred to GIMP and Krita just fine, but maybe there are features in Photoshop $CURRENT that are really needed and we just don't know about them
[01:47:45] <zleap> mkulko, and wifi on laptops
[01:47:48] <tejr> urza9814: That's true, but the way this manifests in practice is that the user hears about GIMP, installs it, might even like it, but will see the "missing features" that e.g. Inkscape or Darktable or Krita would provide, and assumes they can't do it
[01:47:49] *** Quits: UsL (~UsL@user/usl) (Quit: UsL)
[01:48:05] <GNUtoo> lxo: so it's possible to add that in the stories too, like Countee went to an install party and got ubuntu installed. He though it was fully free software, but he later discovered that it was not. Since then he switched to Trisquel and used free software channels to get help instead.
[01:48:09] <zleap> this is why we perhaps need to observe the current user workflow
[01:48:20] <tejr> And so we have memes like "bro GIMP sucks it can't replace Photoshop", and fair enough, it can't---but add on the other software doing complementary functions and you've got much more of an argument
[01:48:30] <GNUtoo> lxo: I indeed, that would be really funny...

[01:51:03] <lxo> GNUtoo, *nod*, sounds like a nice way to present the frequent undesirable scenarios that those attempting to climb the freedom ladder are likely to run into
[01:51:09] <ggoes> yeah, urza9814. that's worth thinking about, i think. just need to be careful not to overwhelm people with the technical aspects
[01:51:15] <tejr> Pick free software (plural) that replaces what the offending proprietary program does, not just what you would use it for
[01:51:21] <zleap> yeah
[01:51:51] <zleap> at the same time we should try and get local training providers to provide training in free software 
[01:51:55] <GNUtoo> We could also show some absurdity of some situations like Jack wanted to use libreoffice in the company he works for, and that has been a continuos friction. Out of a sudden the company decided to switch to libreoffice after microsoft moved it to SASS. Since then everybody had training on libreoffice and he helped his coworkers solving libreoffice issues.

[01:54:22] <zleap> taking computers and installing free software
[01:54:37] <zleap> but the young people at the school do it as part of a club
[01:54:38] <mkulko> by the way, could we mention that the best hardware to run free software on is not the modern nvidia gpus which restrict users' freedom  (mining limiters) and that new intel cpus contain the intel ME backdoor which cant be uninstalled on most computers?
[01:55:06] <Armand> ME isn't a "backdoor"
[01:55:11] <GNUtoo> lxo: and we could have at least 1 failure where the character moves on to switch again to free software in another situation where it works way better
[01:55:16] <madage> urza9814, psydroid, yeap, the think for me with some programs is simply that I don't know which features the user thinks is a must on the nonfree one they've became addicted and often I do not even use the appropriate free software replacement, so the most I can say is: well you could write a feature request ( and offer help to do so)
[01:55:18] <ggoes> yeah mkulko ; i think we're going to be devoting attention to that further down the ladder. saying you don't have to switch hardware right now, but when your current computer stops working, keep the hardware compatible with free software in mind
[01:55:32] <madage> the thing
[01:55:46] <tejr> mkulko: I suggest we don't mention mining limiters when doing that; I think saying simply that Nvidia actively refuses to make their hardware work at full speed with free software drivers written by a community would be more persuasive
[01:55:51] <tejr> I do agree it could be mentioned
[01:55:58] <tejr> But please don't bring cryptocurrency into it, even obliquely
[01:56:09] <ggoes> we won't, i don't see a reason to do that
[01:56:14] <tejr> Thank you
[01:56:28] <GNUtoo> tejr: we have way better examples of hardware crippled by nonfree software
[01:56:41] <tejr> GNUtoo: What would you suggest?
[01:56:46] <GNUtoo> The ath9k story
[01:57:07] <tejr> I had a friend recently who tried to switch to GNU/Linux on a Surface laptop and I was horrified to see how badly-supported everything ewas
[01:57:26] <Armand> Surface laptops are already a horror story running Windows..
[01:57:34] <tejr> Armand: I can believe it
[01:57:35] <GNUtoo> Where because of the hardware architecture and software freedom you got most of the hard bugs solved first like latency bloat, the group keys security issue, and it got obtimized for mesh as well and so on
[01:57:40] <madage> tejr: thanks for those, I'll add them to a list as I've never heard of them
[01:57:53] <tejr> madage: Ha!  You're welcome
[01:57:56] <GNUtoo> Another way could be CHDK or similar fimrwares
[01:58:02] <GNUtoo> *similar applications
[01:58:05] *** Quits: gilq (~Gimg@user/gimg) (Quit: WeeChat 2.3)
[01:58:08] <GNUtoo> Where it unlocks many possibilties
[01:58:11] <lxo> "Joe asked the community for recommendations of a new computer to install GNU/Linux-libre.  Sophie saw his question and pointed out that a new computer would not respect Joe's freedom as much as an older computer would"
[01:58:30] <urza9814> GNUtoo: Oh man, I haven't heard about CHDK in years, but that is an excellent example IMO :)
[01:58:33] <mkulko> Armand: how can you prove that ME isnt a backdoor when its literally a separate chip that can access your internet, memory, disk, bios. And if it isnt a backdoor then how about intel not install it on home computers that dont need remote management?
[01:58:33] <tejr> lxo: New converts love learning that their old computer may not be as useless as they thought :)
[01:58:48] <Armand> mkulko: False assertions are false.
[01:58:50] <GNUtoo> urza9814: there is also magic lantern which has even been used professionally
[01:59:08] <tejr> I think for new people who are eager to try a new distro, running a second separate computer (much less of an expensive proposition that it was in even the early 2000s) is a good route
[01:59:08] <Armand> mkulko: You'd need to look at how it works and how it was "exploited".
[01:59:09] <GNUtoo> urza9814: in some movies they needed very compact cameras (like to film from within a car for instance)
[01:59:16] * TheBlueWizard . . o O ( what is CHDK? )
[02:00:01] <GNUtoo> mkulko: it's meant to remove your freedom in any case
[02:00:03] <urza9814> TheBlueWizard: alternate firmware for Canon cameras...or at least that's all it was last time I checked (about ten years ago lol)...lets you write scripts, play games, and do other weird stuff lol
[02:00:06] <arielcostas> tejr: And Losedows users with old computers could be shown GNU/Linux as an ethically better alternative that will save them from buying new hardware because Microsoft decides your computer is too old
[02:00:10] <zleap> on the other hand, regarding new hardware , there is a lot of ARM boards that support Linux fully that could be very suited
[02:00:23] <GNUtoo> mkulko: there is DRM in it and so on so it's designed to prevent you from fully controlling your computer
[02:00:24] <tejr> ggoes: I think something good for the Freedom Ladder might be an explicit mention of a computer that is now too old-and-slow to run Windows is probably perfectly useable with GNU/Linux, and that it's an easy way to try things out---maybe in the same list as LiveCDs
[02:00:46] <tejr> ggoes: In my own experience, they love that, and they get interested
[02:00:54] <ggoes> tejr: that's doable. my current computer is the 07 macbook compatible with libreboot ;)
[02:01:02] <GNUtoo> Oh I got a good idea also: show a failure with nonfree software
[02:01:06] <zleap> tejr, yeah U sent zoe a link on using older hardware 
[02:01:11] <GNUtoo> The raspberry PI is a very good idea
[02:01:12] <zleap> I sent
[02:01:23] <urza9814> GNUtoo: Easy, pick any of the hundreds of stories from the Win10 upgrade! lol
[02:01:36] <zleap> there is a propriatory blob with the PI but there are lots of arm boards
[02:01:57] <tejr> I have to get ready for work now folks (NZ), but this has been great, thank you; ggoes I appreciate the FSF's work on this idea (in general always, but in particular this one) very much
[02:02:05] <urza9814> tejr: Yeah I also like a trip to the local thrift store, often that's cheaper and more powerful than a Pi, plus it might keep something out of the dumpster for a bit longer
[02:02:10] <GNUtoo> John bought a Raspberry PI and though that the small GPU firmware was not much of an issue, but he later found out that it was a full blown OS. He now uses an ARM board that can boot with free software.
[02:02:10] <ggoes> no problem tejr, thank you for joining
[02:02:25] <zleap> yeah
[02:02:29] <johnicboom> I think most Windows users have a story about how a poorly timed automatic update caused them trouble 
[02:02:38] <GNUtoo> Lihe you'd show that becuase it's nonfree it might hide a huge issue
[02:02:47] <GNUtoo> And that happens over and over I guess
[02:02:58] <zleap> https://socialcompare.com/en/comparison/arm-boards
[02:03:04] <ggoes> johnicboom: yeah, just a few days ago i heard from a friend who had it happen to them just as they were connecting to give a presentation
[02:03:07] <arielcostas> urza9814: Windows 11 downgrade will leave many people out, they are more likely to want to switch to GNU/Linux
[02:03:07] <ggoes> haha
[02:03:09] <urza9814> johnicboom: Yeah and if you mention that even airports can't always control that stuff...so they realize it's the software, not just that they don't know how to configure it how they want
[02:03:23] <lxo> arielcostas, make that Vista XI
[02:03:24] <zleap> maybe we need to get more behind arm builds
[02:03:28] <Armand> Yes
[02:03:35] <GNUtoo> There is also that: https://www.fsf.org/resources/hw/single-board-computers
[02:03:43] <arielcostas> zleap: Vista was a success... in bringing more users to GNU/Linux
[02:03:44] <mkulko> GNUtoo: yeah i hope separate 'trusted encryption' stuff like TPM and AMD PSP that implements drm and also rsa encryption mechanisms that we are supposed to 'trust' will be gone in the future once users realise that they exist
[02:03:53] <johnicboom> arielcostas: that's a great point, that might be an amazing time to try to push free software to our friends and family.
[02:03:53] <lxo> "xi"" in pt(_BR?) means something like "oh fsck!" :-)
[02:04:02] <GNUtoo> We could also add stories where companies use the power they have to trap users even more
[02:04:18] <ggoes> haha
[02:04:19] <GNUtoo> and the user would have switched when that happened or just before
[02:04:56] <arielcostas> johnicboom: When my friends talked about M$'s annoncement I said I would refuse to run Windows 11, and they shouldn't too because of all the terrible things it will (supposedly) bring
[02:04:59] <ggoes> mkulko: yes. we were toying with the idea of introducing "bad" forms of encryption during the ladder step devoted to encryption, e.g. drm
[02:05:01] <zleap> in theory if I got myself a pi 4 + 8gb ram it would be more powerful than my current desktop 
[02:05:11] <GNUtoo> It could be with a software update that brings more restriction or with "Intel computers" that now have management engines and so on
[02:05:14] <zleap> 4 core vs 2 core,   8g over 4g
[02:05:40] <zleap> i like playing cc&c red alert in snaps though
[02:06:32] <mkulko> actually, talking about TPM, how about we mention that microsoft promised that windows 10 was the last version, then released 11 and added the unnecessary tpm requirement. with free software even if the author imposed some unnecessary restrictions like that they can be easily patched out, but not in windows 11's case.
[02:06:48] <ggoes> mkulko: we have an article coming out about that before too long
[02:06:49] <ggoes> so i agree
[02:06:53] <lxo> a pi can be a step up the freedom latter for a lot of people, but I'm not really comfortable recommending it.  if someone is getting another computer, it would probably be best if it could be one they could take all the way up the ladder
[02:07:01] <ggoes> i agree lxo
[02:07:06] <zleap> With debian if I back up .thunderbird, reinstall debian and then copy .thunderbird back over I can carry on from where i left off
[02:07:26] <lxo> heh latter :-)
[02:07:31] <ggoes> haha
[02:07:36] <PCITechie> lxo: agreed, if you need to buy new hardware may as well get some that you can use all the way
[02:07:40] <GNUtoo> lxo: I'd really like to add a story where the user is making a mistake by thinking that the small nonfree software is not an issue and it turn to be a huge issue
[02:07:43] <zleap> does that work with the same folder from windows so can i back up the config / mail folder on windows, install debian, copy filder to debian and just carry on
[02:08:00] <urza9814> zleap: Yeah I noticed that when I was redoing my media center recently, with Plex (yeah, non-free I think) you just copy a folder to back it up on *nix, but on Windows you've gotta migrate a bunch of registry keys and stuff....looks awful lol

[02:11:17] <GNUtoo> btw, how are we supposed to sumarize all that?

[02:11:29] <lxo> GNUtoo, agreed, not a good idea
[02:12:04] <zleap> GNUtoo, i think these meets have opened a huge can of worms,  we are really passionate about this, have loads of ideas but have also highlighted alot of problems / barriers 
[02:12:25] <GNUtoo> Having stoies looks like a good idea at least
[02:12:31] <GNUtoo> *users stories
[02:12:32] <TheBlueWizard> GNUtoo: For a very long time we have been watching out for insecurities in software. Now we have to watch out for insecurities in hardware (Rowhammer, CPU vulnerabilities, etc.)
[02:12:33] <zleap> urza9814, i think the fact backup / restore is a lot easier under debian could be a major selling point
[02:12:37] <ggoes> yeah GNUtoo
[02:12:42] <GNUtoo> and it enable to solve many issues when framing things
[02:13:01] <GNUtoo> so we could write that down

[02:16:54] * GNUtoo found that also: https://noise.getoto.net/2020/06/10/second-debian-med-covid-19-hackathon/
[02:17:07] <GNUtoo> "A recently shared pre-publication draft paper highlights which
[02:17:07] <GNUtoo> software tools are considered useful “to Accelerate SARS-CoV-2 and
[02:17:07] <GNUtoo> Coronavirus Research”. Many of these tools would benefit from being
[02:17:07] <GNUtoo> packaged in Debian and all the advantages that Debian brings for both
[02:17:07] <GNUtoo> users and upstream alike"
[02:17:08] <zleap> ah yeah
[02:17:38] <lxo> GNUtoo, how about Terry thought upgrading to the latest version of the operating system he runs couldn't possibly be a bad idea, but was surprised that it would no longer run his favorite program, wouldn't allow him to install a newer version of that program, and wouldn't allow him to downgrade or reinstall the previous version of the operating system"
[02:17:40] <GNUtoo> Packaging in Guix probably helps too as it's used in high performance computing too
[02:17:47] <zleap> while what they are doing may seem complex people will relate to covid at least and the fact free software and openness generally has helped fight it
[02:17:59] <GNUtoo> lxo: nice + his hardware doesn't work anymore
[02:17:59] <lxo> (slightly inspired by a play station firmware update that blocked installing gnu/linux)
[02:18:16] <zleap> that was on the ps3 iirc
[02:18:41] <GNUtoo> lxo: Terry bought a cheap computer and thought that upgrading to the latest version of the operating system he runs couldn't possibly be a bad idea [...]
[02:18:48] <lxo> IIRC such things happend on MacOS upgrades too
[02:18:52] <GNUtoo> And here the upgrade fails and so on...
[02:19:24] <zleap> free software may not be perfect in that respect but there are usually fixes
[02:19:26] <GNUtoo> and then he gets it fixed and the free program he depended on didn't work anymore, and his hardware didn't work anymore...

[02:22:07] <lxo> isn't android breaking compatibility with .apk soon?  or is it just the app store?
[02:22:30] <tpefreedom> It would have to be certain phones.
[02:22:35] <GNUtoo> I'm thinking of something like that but where the application is really blocked for some reason (permissions for instance, if it requires a driver)
[02:22:36] <tpefreedom> There is always aosp.
[02:22:51] <GNUtoo> for apk I'm not sure, I think the issue is different
[02:23:08] <lxo> yeah
[02:23:15] <GNUtoo> As I understand application makers will have to use a different format, and that format will enable google play to create a dedicated apk out of it
[02:23:37] <GNUtoo> So the issue is for people not wanting to use f-droid, but then you've also got the issue of Maven central
[02:24:04] <tpefreedom> I've gotten more interested in older/vintage computers. If a task is something you can do on your own computer w/o internet, and it doesn't require powerful hardware, an older computer would probably be better since it would lack stuff like ME.
[02:24:06] <GNUtoo> Where free software depends on artefacts and you don't know if these artefacts have a corresponding free source code somewhere or not and how to build it
[02:24:18] <tpefreedom> maven central?

[02:25:05] <GNUtoo> of the android applications depend on Gradle, and in turn, Maven [...]"
[02:25:10] <lxo> well, any OS upgrade could in theory prevent unsigned / unauthorized (by the OS supplier) apps from running, or even from being installed, but it's still unthinkable to me that an OS supplier would actually do that at a system version bump
[02:25:22] <GNUtoo> [about maven central] "I tried to write some scripts etc. that reconstructs the software from
[02:25:36] <GNUtoo> the incomplete source jars [...] but this failed on all"
[02:25:37] <GNUtoo> but ~10% of java class files
[02:25:51] <GNUtoo> So it's a trap I think, a bit like the java trap
[02:26:03] <GNUtoo> but the difference here is that it's way more subtle
[02:26:04] <tpefreedom> We should have amobile os that isn't reliant on the android codebase.

[02:27:06] <GNUtoo> Here packaging it all in Guix could help
[02:27:29] <tpefreedom> although I'm thinking that in the long run, an os optimized for a single user, low power devices, etc might be better. (the unix tools were originally for multiuser setups.)
[02:27:33] <GNUtoo> Guix has the ability to have abstractions over package manager, so you could build all pacakges for Android if you wanted
[02:29:06] <tpefreedom> Does anyone know of a good cable/port for directly connecting two computers together (not lan/ethernet, a direct connection) for stuff like transferring files?
[02:29:18] <GNUtoo> If we add a new target and a new format and package lots of Android components, and lots of dependencies from source code that are in maven central, we could do that: guix pack --target=arm-android-linux --format=apk silence

[02:29:53] <GNUtoo> It'd probably require some obtimization too for making the apks small
[02:29:57] <zleap> i am sure there used to be cables for that and programs like minicom
[02:30:28] <GNUtoo> tpefreedom: it depends on the context and on the computers
[02:30:47] <zleap> can you still get USB cables for that
[02:30:53] <urza9814> tpefreedom: ...crossover lan wouldn't work?
[02:31:11] <tpefreedom> I just want to be able to connect two.
[02:31:21] <tpefreedom> lan seems to complicated for that.
[02:31:42] <zleap> https://www.wiringo.com/usb-transfer-cable-what-you-need-to-know.html
[02:31:43] <GNUtoo> tpefreedom: the easiest is networking as it handles concurent access / writing to files, you need two network cards and 1 network cable for that
[02:31:44] <tpefreedom> Also, it's likely that I would have one laptop and some old desktop.
[02:32:09] <GNUtoo> tpefreedom: the downside is that you need to configure the software not to enable access to the data to the other networks
[02:32:30] <tpefreedom> Can ethernet connect 2 computers directly w/o a router/switch?
[02:32:35] <urza9814> yes
[02:32:42] <urza9814> but you probably need a crossover cable
[02:32:42] <zleap> cross over

[02:33:10] <zleap> you then set each computer up with a static ip address i think
[02:33:11] <GNUtoo> tpefreedom: yes it can, the downside is that the software you use to share file need to be configured to only be on the private network between the two computers if you want to have security and keep it very simple
[02:33:38] <urza9814> GNUtoo: assuming they both have other internet connections... :)

[02:34:33] <urza9814> FYI, you can turn an ethernet cable into a crossover cable with just a pair of scissors and some electrical tape, I've done it and used that cable for years, but buying a real one works too :P
[02:34:45] <tpefreedom> This is largely hypothetical at this point. It would depend on what machine I use. I wonder if serial->usb adapters would work.
[02:34:48] <TheBlueWizard> it'd be nice to design/build a truly RYF stamped box that can be used as tool to liberate various devices discussed here

[02:38:14] <zleap> hi zoe 
[02:38:28] <GNUtoo> tpefreedom: you then need some protocol to mount a folder from one computer to the other
[02:38:55] <tpefreedom> I've been looking more at some 90s or early-mid 2000s stuff. Since that stuff likely wouldn't have internet, and would be pre-ME, it would be a good environment if I wanted to do some offline task more securely.
[02:38:59] <GNUtoo> zleap: you need special hardware for that, for the program mainly standard tools like modprobe, mount etc will work
[02:39:21] <urza9814> maybe a USB to serial adapter and just cat the files into there directly...? :)
[02:39:22] <zleap> we had 9 pin serial ports back then along with programs like minicom
[02:39:25] <GNUtoo> zleap: USB otg devices can "emulate" things like USB keys and so on but it's painful to use as you would have syncronization issues

[02:42:31] <GNUtoo> The idea was to be able to SSH in the machine from a serial port to be able to reconfigure the network and so on if needed

[05:47:03] <lispmacs[work]> calher: I'm not quite understanding what that means
[05:47:17] <calher> I have a very old copy of my disk (RINGO) dd'd to two other disks (JOHN and PAUL.)  I just want to update them without doing a really long, four-hour dd.
[05:47:58] <calher> Since JOHN and PAUL were exact copies, there is surely a way to rsync it and preserve all file attributes.

[05:48:47] <lispmacs[work]> since rsync only deals with files.

[17:58:06] <jemarch> just make sure that the distribution terms are clearly stated _along_ with each poem

[17:59:30] <jemarch> but yes
[17:59:40] <jemarch> no harm in having a two lines paragraph repeated in 33 text files
[18:00:32] <Guest9095> I currently added the CC BY SA in the poems dir and NOTICE stating the extent of applicability of Apache is that a fine way?

[18:01:24] <jemarch> ok
[18:03:02] <Guest9095> Did not mean to spam this thread. But this was geniune concern and I do not want hassle of including the line for me and my co poets..

[21:30:09] <adfeno> Hi all, hi craigt ;)
[21:30:43] <craigt> We are into hour two of this week's Free Software Directory Meeting. If you are new or just want a refresher, check out the participation guidelines. https://directory.fsf.org/wiki/Free_Software_Directory:Participate We also have the directory-discuss mailing list which you can sign up for at https://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/directory-discuss
[21:30:48] <craigt> adfeno: How's it going?
[21:31:57] <adfeno> Fine, did some home organizing. ;)
[21:32:40] <craigt> adfeno: A good home organizing, that is always satisfying.
[21:33:33] <adfeno> … but I wish I could have done more, I was mostly protecting myself from cold (I hate Winter since I catch colds with ease).
[21:36:03] <adfeno> Next week's forecast marks a temperature raise, so I should be more productive. ;)

[21:42:23] *** Joins: OMYasuda (~OMYasuda@177.62.168.87)
[21:42:34] <mkulko> adfeno: i think it's completely reasonable. gnu/linux is the most popular free operating system, and whats the point of a libre program that only runs on, for example, windows or macos?
[21:43:13] <adfeno> mkulko: So you are in favor of keeping the requirement?
[21:44:15] <mkulko> well, yeah, as long as gnu/linux is the most popular free operating system.
[21:45:32] <adfeno> But that would mean projects such as Replicant won't be able to add entries for the FSD, regarding FSDG-fit applications.
[21:46:06] <johns> seems to me that "free programs that run only on proprietary OS" is better served by a different resource (and in the past we have put some of that info under our Working Together campaign, now it could be in Freedom Ladder maybe) -- otherwise we have needs in conflict (people already on free OSes finding programs they can't use)
[21:46:17] *** Parts: mrkubax10 (~mrkubax10@178.43.224.239.ipv4.supernova.orange.pl) (Leaving.)
[21:46:31] <johns> but -- maybe the approach of "runs on a free OS / endorsed distro" is possible, which would address Replicant
[21:47:03] <ggoes> i would personally be fine with runs on *a* fully free OS
[21:47:31] *** Joins: kompowiec (~kompowiec@89-64-44-227.dynamic.chello.pl)
[21:47:45] <adfeno> Personally, I would remove the "Runs-on" category and focus on FSDG-fit distros.
[21:48:21] <adfeno> Since the FSD is mostly a place for reviews of packages to be included on FSDG-fit distros.
[21:48:39] <johns> that may be what it's currently most useful for, but that's not its mission
[21:49:29] <tpefreedom> ggoes, what are your thoughts on the runs-on categories?
[21:50:28] <adfeno> I mean: the FSD would continue to exist, what I would suggest is just to remove the "Runs-on" category, since FSD has requirements that are similar (if not the same) to the FSDG.
[21:52:25] <tpefreedom> adfeno, does "runs-on" promote nonfree OSes in your opinion?
[21:53:19] *** Joins: skapata (~Skapata@user/skapata)
[21:54:02] *** ChanServ sets mode: -o ggoes
[21:54:02] <craigt> Without the "runs-on" category a proprietary OS user may never get exposure to free software.(well not never, but you know what I mean).
[21:54:09] <ggoes> tpefreedom: runs-on is very useful info imo
[21:54:24] <adfeno> tpefreedom: if you believe that and have arguments and proof of that, then it would be a good point to consider. My personal reson for removal of "Runs-on" is another one.
[21:54:47] <ggoes> it promotes the free programs; it doesn't promote the nonfree OS
[21:55:57] <johns> right, and any program a user finds on the directory while still using a proprietary OS, they will still be able to use when they switch to a free os
[21:55:59] <tpefreedom> adfeno, so you think the FSD should more be for FSDG-compliant distros?
[21:56:09] <adfeno> craigt: for proprietary OSs we have Freedom_Ladder, as johns and McMahon (on the mailing list) pointed out.

[21:57:07] <panosalevro> added guetzli
[21:57:09] <johns> (I also think that programs a user will have to eventually stop using as they climb the ladder are not great steps on the ladder)
[21:57:39] <adfeno> On the other side of the tracks, however, if we do want to merge Freedom_Ladder into FSDG, then I think we should lift "runs on GNU+Linux" requirement.
[21:57:45] <tpefreedom> I still don't see why we need a separate resource for finding free programs for proprietary OSes and the fsd only for fully free oses.
[21:58:14] <ggoes> the ladder is not a resource to find programs; i'm sure it'll end up suggesting a few programs that are on the directory, but its purpose isn't to catalog software
[21:58:59] <johns> tpefreedom: you can also see it in the resource/priority terms. listing all the programs that run on free oses in the directory is already a big job that we are currently nowhere near completing (though we could get a lot closer by finishing the automated import work) -- it's problematic to start adding more purposes
[21:59:22] *** Joins: schumaml3 (~schumaml@dslb-178-002-183-160.178.002.pools.vodafone-ip.de)
[21:59:28] <tpefreedom> but why only gnu/linux distros and not replicant?
[21:59:55] <tpefreedom> I think it might be useful to add replicant sprograms to the directory.
[22:00:04] <ggoes> i think we agree about that
[22:00:07] <johns> well, there is f-droid already. but I don't think I'm opposed to the idea of having the directory be for all free / endorsed distros
[22:00:12] <adfeno> (continuing: other side of the tracks)… merging those and lifting the requirement of "runs on GNU+Linux" would allow for people in currently FSDG-unfit distros to see that they have replacements even on the FSDG-fit distros.
[22:00:18] <johns> I'd still encourage people to prioritize adding gnu/linux programs

[22:07:17] <johns> (because you can host your own repo and configure the client to point to that)

[22:25:11] <bone-baboon> Audacity has new administration. Muse Group now control the Audacity repository. Muse Group plans to add an anti feature (tracking) to Audacity. An overview is here <https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/guix-devel/2021-07/msg00077.html>.
[22:25:21] <bone-baboon> Muse Group's new draft privacy policy for Audacity introduces on by default telemetry and an age restriction. Here is information on the privacy policy. <https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/guix-devel/2021-07/msg00083.html>
[22:25:29] <bone-baboon> It looks like the age restriction interferes with freedom 0.
[22:25:36] <bone-baboon> What do others think of the these changes Muse Group is making to Audacity?

[22:30:07] <adfeno> bone-baboon: Just for completion, please add notes about your findings on [[Talk:Audacity]]

[22:30:32] <ggoes> not a lawyer etc etc
[22:31:23] <craigt> bone-baboon: It would make it non-free, but I understand the telemetry can be disabled (and not require the age restriction).

[23:36:27] <bone-baboon> craigt: Thanks for sharing that link. Looking at 1353 it sounds like the age restriction has been lifted. It also sounds like operating systems building Audacity from source will not have telemetry on by default. However because of Muse Group's many recent missteps with Audacity it is probably a good idea to watch and see what Muse Group actually ends up doing with their first Audacity release.

[23:39:09] <tpefreedom> Basically AROS is meant to be a free implementation of/replacement for the old amiga os (workbench). I'm not involved in the project myself but I do find it interesting.
[23:39:22] <tpefreedom> Has licensing and compliance looked at the aros pulbic license?
