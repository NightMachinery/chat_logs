[05:03:32] <FromGitter> <marekyggdrasil> could someone recommend some most basic tutorial on elisp? Simple things like how to execute those scripts and some simple examples etc, I just need something to get started and rest I will figure out as I play with it

[10:02:55] <dokma> Anyone knows why g f isn't boung to find-file-at-point inside the Help buffer?
[10:03:27] <dokma> For example if I C-h v eshell-aliases-file  I'd like to then just go g f to open that file.
[10:04:12] <dokma> But for some reason, within the Help buffer, g f isn't bound to find-file-at-point while it is bound in other buffers.

[20:04:47] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> I would recommend "An Introduction to Programming in Emacs Lisp". You can read is right inside Spacemacs by typing `SPC h j eintr`. In that way you can run the examples directly from the guide. However, info-mode is not yet Spacemacsey by default, so you'd better run `M-: (evil-collection-info-setup)` to activate the evil collection keybindings (https://github.com/emacs-e
[20:04:47] <FromGitter> ... vil/evil-collection/blob/master/modes/info/evil-collection-info.el).
[20:08:59] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> Besides that there are two important things to know... first all functions unders `SPC h d` and second is `edebug`. Edebug is really simple to use, and can be very helpful and educational. Here (https://develop.spacemacs.org/layers/+lang/emacs-lisp/README.html#debugging)  you find the Spacemacs edebug keybindings. For those you are required to install the `emacs-lisp` layer...
[20:10:09] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> > *<dokma>* Anyone knows why g f isn't boung to find-file-at-point inside the Help buffer? ‚èé  ‚èé You can better use 'ace-jump' by pressing `o`
[20:10:47] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> Well... if you mean the link...
