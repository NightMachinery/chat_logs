[21:18:38] <jensen> I have the file listing url links: https://0x0.st/osHn.txt. How to get started with awk? When passed a script argument for an imgur link e.g. 'https://i.imgur.com/WMJV3J8.png', the script should find this line in the text file and then narrow its scope to everything under the preceding comment line, i.e. `# 2021-12-29_234031`. Then, it counts 'https://i.imgur.com/' lines up to the line in question,
[21:18:40] <jensen> i.e. it is the 2nd link in this section. So then it searches for `https://imgur.com/delete/` links below and counts to the 2nd link, which is the corresponding delete link for that file. It should print this link. Basically, I give the script an imgur link and it gives me the corresponding delete link. After that, optionally request deleting both links from the text file
[21:22:04] *** Joins: tirnanog (~tirnanog@user/tirnanog)
[21:25:19] <earnestly> With some difficulty as this isn't formatted in a way condusive to awk's nature (tabular).  But there is enough information within each line to do this based on line-wise pattern scanning while not needing to store everything
[21:26:33] <earnestly> Actually no, you would have to store
[21:27:07] <earnestly> You would have to maintain an array for each item after each # comment, and if your url is present in that array, iterate through the array and handle the entries accordingly
[21:28:15] <jensen> ty
[21:29:07] <earnestly> jensen: Can you format this file in a different way?
[21:30:05] <earnestly> jensen: In other words, awk would be much better if you repeated the 'heading' for each item instead of storing it like this.
[21:30:51] <earnestly> jensen: E.g. https://0x0.st/osbu.txt
[21:31:08] <earnestly> Hm
[21:31:28] <earnestly> No, this has the same problem, sorry I'm not thinking
[21:33:04] <earnestly> jensen: Yeah, I'd do something like: https://0x0.st/osb1.txt
[21:33:08] <earnestly> Makes it quite simple
[21:34:12] <jensen> Ok yea, I'm just gonna do <link> <delete link>. I didn't like to print it out this way as the contents of this file was printed to stdout and I wanted them to just copy and paste the imgur links without the delete links but i can just print the first column
[21:34:35] <jensen> ty
[21:35:09] <earnestly> I don't quite understand what the format is supposed to be describing, I suppose
[21:35:27] <emanuele6> https://0x0.st/osb_.txt with RS="" and FS="\n"
[21:36:15] <earnestly> Yeah, I might be misunderstanding what this is for though
[21:36:15] <emanuele6> it is basically the same thing, but it is more readable and easier to filter
[21:36:27] <earnestly> Also I keep forgetting about RS=""
[21:36:49] <earnestly> Which, to be fair, is probably due to me not doing anything programming related
[21:37:46] <jensen> i'm just making the data more effort to parse than it needs to be
[21:38:58] <earnestly> Yes
[21:39:19] <earnestly> If you can always try to make the format easier to handle within the nature of the tools you're using
[21:39:46] <earnestly> (Sometimes it's even worthwhile transforming formats that you don't control into something nicer, just to make the subsequent parsing simpler)
