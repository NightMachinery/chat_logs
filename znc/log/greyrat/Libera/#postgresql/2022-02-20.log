[03:11:00] <gajus> Is there any way to speed up `CREATE DATABASE ... TEMPLATE ...`?
[03:13:17] <gajus> I already have fsync=off,synchronous_commit=off,full_page_writes=off
[03:15:57] <xisop> i'm curious as to how long that command is taking you?
[03:17:07] <gajus> over 2 seconds
[03:17:08] <peerce> does your template have lots of tables and data in it ?
[03:17:31] <gajus> little data, lots of tables
[03:18:09] <peerce> so lots of files (data and index for said tables) have to be copied, lots of metadata has to be integrated into the new database schema definition
[03:18:55] <peerce> and wow, 2 seconds, thats gonna break teh bank.   I dunno about you, but for me, databases are something I create once and use for a long time.
[03:20:00] <peerce> hmmm.    on my rather slow server, create database test template 'template0';    is taking 3 seconds.
[03:20:44] <gajus> dammit. fsync=off,synchronous_commit=off,full_page_writes=off was written to a wrong conf file
[03:20:51] <gajus> after these changes it is down to 300ms
[03:21:09] <gajus> peerce: we re-create the entire database for every integration test
[03:21:44] <peerce> rather tahn writing stuff to .conf files, I like using ALTER SYSTEM

[07:24:48] <jdak907> Hi, can someone help? I am trying to install psqlodbc_13_02_0000-x64.msi on Win11 (MacOS Parallels M1). I get this error: "Error installing ODBC driver: PostgreSQL ANSI(x64), ODBC error 13: The setup routines for the PostgreSQL ANSI(x64) ODBC driver could not be loaded due to system error code 193: .. Verify that the file PostgreSQL ANSI(x64) exists and that you can access it."
[07:26:15] <jdak907> I have successfully installed this same version ODBC driver on my native Win10 machine, set up the postgreSQL unicode x64 server and accessed the data through Excel data connection.
[07:27:48] <jdak907> I'm not sure if it is something with the Win 11 operating system. I have installed the latest V C++ runtime environment and rebooted, didn't help.
[07:29:35] <peerce> click start, type odbc, and select the odbc (64 bit) data sources thing that shows up.
[07:29:53] <peerce> is the postgresql driver listed on 'Drivers' ?
[07:30:13] <jdak907> the only one that shows up is 32-bit when I do that.
[07:30:34] <peerce> huh.   my win11 stock laptop config here shows odbc data sources (64-bit)

[07:33:41] <jdak907> When I open that version from the WOW64 folder, it does not show the postgresql driver available... it does show the postgresql driver in the 32-bit version.
[07:33:52] <jdak907> but... I need 64-bit

[09:07:43] <sobel> but that's a bit savage
[09:09:08] <trafficjam> is psql separate from postgresql?
[09:09:31] <peerce> its a client utility, usually bundled with the client libraries, depends on the OS packaging
[09:09:54] <peerce> its part of the postgres source tarball, but really only needs libpq and a few system dependencies

[09:19:13] <segfaultfizzbuzz> is there a way of enforcing a constraint across tables (perhaps within a schema)?
[09:19:26] <segfaultfizzbuzz> for example maybe i want to make sure that my tables always have some kind of access control annotation
[09:21:36] <peerce> there's several types of constraints.  a  unique constraint.  a foreign key constraint, and a check constraint.      what is 'access control annotation' actually ?    some magic values in some fields?   or are you talking about GRANT / DENY sorts of sql level permissions?   or what?
[09:23:51] <segfaultfizzbuzz> well someone could make a naked table with ambiguous access control rights
[09:24:03] <peerce> wqhat sort of access control rights are you talking about ?
[09:24:13] <peerce> do you mean GRANT style privileges to the ttabel itself ?
[09:24:13] <segfaultfizzbuzz> so, it would seem to make sense if someone could say "if you have a table, you must declare what access bucket it goes in"
[09:24:26] <peerce> 'access bucket' is meaningless to postgresql
[09:24:38] <segfaultfizzbuzz> ah yes sorry at the moment a simple example of this would be that all tables must have a specified column
[09:24:55] <segfaultfizzbuzz> and that column could declare what access bucket the row goes into
[09:25:02] <peerce> huh.
[09:25:06] <peerce> ??row level security
[09:25:07] <pg_docbot> Nothing found
[09:25:09] <peerce> ??RLS
[09:25:10] <pg_docbot> https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/ddl-rowsecurity.html
[09:25:18] <peerce> there's a function like that built into postgres
[09:25:27] <peerce> where you can have per row ACLs
[09:25:54] <peerce> and they can either be based on sql roles/users, or on other things.
[09:26:39] <peerce> using sql roles for user permissions doesn't fit real well with web applications, which are sessionless, and any web worker process could be working for any user session at any instant
[09:27:38] <segfaultfizzbuzz> web worker process? sessionless?
[09:28:46] <peerce> http is inherently sessionless, and any web server process could be working for a different client user session at any blink in time, all messed up together, this means, the http worker can't use the sql database connection for end user authentication without going through a bunch of song and dance.
[09:29:21] <peerce> web apps typically have to use a framework to fake their way around this.
[09:29:37] <peerce> those frameworks generally rely on all processes using hte same SQL user
[09:29:57] <segfaultfizzbuzz> yes right
[09:30:34] <peerce> there's nothing in SQL which you can use to enforce that every CREATE TABLE automatically has to have a given field
[09:31:00] <peerce> now for a given table that has this field, you can use a check constraint, or a insert/update trigger to ensure this magic field contains meaningful stuff.

[09:43:04] <peerce> I suppose you could setup a ssh port forward, like ssh -L 5432:rdsserver:5432 user@ec2
[09:43:29] <peerce> then from your local system, psql -h localhost     would be connected via the ec2 system to the rds system
[09:43:36] <peerce> that assumes ec2 allows ssh port forwarding
[09:44:11] <peerce> Actually, if you have postgres running on your local server, then 5432 is in use, so -L 5440:rdsserver:5432
[09:44:33] <peerce> then psql -h localhost -p 5440     would be connected via the ssh tunnel to the rdsserver:5432

[11:30:42] <trafficjam> hey peerce, is postgres accessed over http?
[11:32:39] <peerce> no
[11:33:05] <peerce> its accessed over the postgres protocol as implemented by libpq, on 5432/tcp by default.
[11:33:32] <peerce> libpq is esssentially the reference model for the protocol.
[11:34:02] <trafficjam> ah ok thanks, can see that aws has it listed under its inbound rules
[11:34:27] <peerce> there are implementtations that do not use libpoq,a nd instead emulate it, such as jdbc, and one of the more popular python bindings, they wanted to be language pure and neutral
[11:35:07] <trafficjam> good to know, thanks
[11:35:22] <peerce> so you can ssh to your ec2 'client' system, can't you?
[11:35:25] <trafficjam> in terms of inbound and outbound rules, do i just need 1 inbound rule?
[11:35:31] <trafficjam> i can yeah
[11:35:49] <trafficjam> but it times out when i try to connect to the rds instance
[11:35:58] <trafficjam> so im guessing there's some more security group config stuff i need to work out
[11:36:10] <trafficjam> creating a new sec group atm specifically for my rds instance

[11:37:00] <peerce> then while that ssh is running, in another local command window, try,  psql -h localhost -p 5450  -U pguser -d pgdatabase
[11:37:19] <peerce> isn't that what I just asked you to do?
[11:37:37] <trafficjam> just wanted to be clear
[11:38:09] <trafficjam> is rdsserver the rds endpoint
[11:38:12] <trafficjam> *?
[11:38:17] <peerce> yes
[11:38:20] <peerce> ip or name
[11:38:33] <peerce> as your ec2 client sees/recognizes
[11:39:53] <peerce> ssh supports 'port forwarding'.   and in this case, you are sshing to your EC2 client systemn, and setting up a port forward from localhost:5450 to rdsserver:5432 that the rds server things came from the ec2 client.
[11:40:20] <trafficjam> oh awesome, didn't know that was possible, trying it now

[11:41:11] <peerce> then you setup ssh keys, so yuou don't need to use passwords, and its slick like grease.

[11:42:04] <trafficjam> same thing happened when trying to psql to the endpoint directly
[11:42:37] <peerce> doing the endpoint directly won't work unless you cnfigure the rds firewall to allow connections from your home/office IP range.

[11:44:26] <trafficjam> if i want to allow my laptop access to the instance, that would be an inbound rule right?
[11:45:38] <trafficjam> although thinking about it now, the current rules should allow any other services using that same sg access
[11:46:03] <trafficjam> and that port forwarding technique you just mentioned timed out

[11:50:44] <peerce> a network gateway in the standard sense, is the route to other networks.   the 'default gateway' is the route to all networks not locally known, but you can also have a gateway (aka route) to a specific set of networks via the locally attached IP of the router that can reach those networks.
[11:51:39] <trafficjam> ah ok
[11:51:42] <peerce> there arre various routing protocols that can dynamically update these routes.   most primitive is RIP, BGP is what the internet backbone uses.
[11:52:22] <peerce> RIP was implemented by routed in days of old.
[11:52:58] <peerce> basically, a RIP router anounced the static routes it had to other networks, and learned about the routers to everything else over the same RIP protocol.
[11:53:08] <peerce> broadcast routing announcements.
[11:54:14] <peerce> simple routed/rip didn't handle multiple paths well at all.

[14:03:53] <peerce> as long as it is a compatiabile build of postgres (same major version, same general compiler stuff)

[14:07:53] <mhmd> does pgdump handle characters that might be problematic?
[14:08:29] *** Joins: NCS_One (~NCS_One@bl11-90-133.dsl.telepac.pt)
[14:08:53] <mhmd> I can use pgdump but I'm worried about weird characters that might exist in my data
[14:09:36] <mhmd> once it had null character in it, I removed it before inserting to database, I don't know what else is there
[14:10:14] <Myon> pg_dump can handle all the stuff that is valid in the encoding
[14:10:33] <Myon> so make sure the both databases are utf-8
[14:10:51] <Myon> NUL was never valid in any encoding
[14:12:06] <peerce> except BYTEA
[14:12:41] <mhmd> does postgres (by default) allow insertion of invalid characters?
[14:12:56] <mhmd> because if it doesn't, then I can be sure they're all valid
[14:13:09] <mhmd> because they're all inserted

[20:46:17] <john93> it's telling me `ERROR: operator does not exist: text -> unknown`
[20:46:29] <john93> `messages` is a `jsonb` column
[20:47:13] <john93> my intuition is that messages is an array, and i get the last element through the use of `-1`, and then i retrieve that element's `created_at` field. but no workie for some reason..

[20:52:00] <john93> oh yeah that's a good question. will that even work? because `created_at` is a number, so i want it to sort as if it's a number, not text
[20:52:18] <john93> should i do something like.. `ORDER BY messages->-1->'created_at'::int8;`` or something?

[21:13:28] <dob1> first one is commented out, so I suppose is default #max_pred_locks_per_relation = -2    the second one the same #max_pred_locks_per_page = 2
[21:14:36] <Zr40> okay. I would suggest setting max_pred_locks_per_relation to -4. The other one can remain unchanged
[21:16:34] <dob1> Zr40, thanks I will do this and testing over the time
[21:16:35] <Zr40> this means that once the transaction has obtained (max_pred_locks_per_transaction / 4) predicate locks, it will change the next predicate to cover the whole table so it won't need any more
[21:17:04] <Zr40> your query is accessing 4 tables and max_pred_locks_per_relation is per relation (table)
[21:17:52] <dob1> ok I will try for sure
[21:18:04] <Zr40> also, use of predicate locks indicates you're using serializable isolation. Perhaps that kind of isolation level is not necessary for your use case

[21:21:50] <Kobaz> what would i do, to bump that? what setting is that?
[21:21:55] <Zr40> does it say anything else?
[21:22:02] <Zr40> and what are you trying to do?
[21:22:15] <Kobaz> create a metric crap-ton of functions in one transaction
[21:22:47] <Zr40> right. That'll require a lock for each of them
[21:23:11] <Zr40> max_locks_per_relation applies here but that's not actually the limit, that's max_locks_per_relation * max_connections
[21:23:19] <Kobaz> k
[21:23:25] <Zr40> per_transaction*
[21:24:16] <Kobaz> what's the default ?
[21:24:20] <Kobaz> of increase max_locks_per_transaction ?
[21:25:23] <Zr40> the default is 64, along with the max_connections default of 100 means there can be at most 6400 locks across all currently active transactions
[21:25:33] <Zr40> increase either (or both)
[21:25:37] <Kobaz> k
[21:25:57] <Zr40> if you have no use for more connections, just increase max_locks_per_transaction
