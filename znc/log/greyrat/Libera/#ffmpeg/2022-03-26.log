[02:06:04] <kapaun> Is there any way to change the size of the buffer?
[02:07:34] <durandal_1707> kapaun: with what command?
[02:08:15] <kapaun> Any command that involves converting one file to another format
[02:08:44] <kapaun> ffmpeg -i video.mp4 -o output.avi for example
[02:09:28] <kapaun> Anyways, how do I change the size of the buffer that's flushed to disk?
[02:10:08] <kapaun> I meant ffmpeg -i video.mp4 output.avi
[02:10:41] <kapaun> durandal_1707, hello?
[02:13:10] <durandal_1707> kapaun: ask on user/devel mailing list
[02:13:43] <furq> there's -flush_packets if you want less buffer
[02:14:51] <kapaun> flush packets just writes data to disk immediately
[02:14:56] <kapaun> I want to increase the buffer size

[11:01:58] <iconoclasthero> i expected the laptop would run rings around the server, but they both ended up around 41-43x conversion rate.  is there some max on conversion rate?
[11:02:21] <furq> no
[11:02:31] <furq> those cpus aren't that much different though
[11:03:12] <iconoclasthero> ok, i guess i was hoping for more...
[11:03:35] <furq> also the laptop cpu is only 2c/4t so decoding, encoding and filtering will maybe slow it down a little bit
[11:04:00] <furq> i mean it's pretty impressive that a laptop cpu beats a server cpu even if it is eight generations newer
[11:04:39] <furq> it's using like a quarter of the power
[11:04:47] <iconoclasthero> hang on, the i3 is only 2 core?

[11:07:07] <iconoclasthero> so screenfetch reports the threads not the cores and the boost speed not the normal speed.
[11:07:40] <furq> yeah if it's not turboing because of thermals then that would also help explain it
[11:08:06] <iconoclasthero> i think that was probably why the server ended up pulling ahead
[11:08:16] <iconoclasthero> this machine doesn't have much of a fan...
[11:08:23] <iconoclasthero> 79C is awfully hot
[11:08:37] <furq> the laptop probably has more background stuff going on as well
[11:08:50] <iconoclasthero> oh well, i closed the lid of my previous laptop on a drill bit
[11:09:04] <iconoclasthero> so i got this from the dell outlet for like $210

[16:19:05] <MG2021> JEEB its not open-source anymore: its a PAY-TO-WIN project!
[16:19:07] <JEEB> he's literally the person who's posted the work-in-progress patches (which anyone can continue working on)
[16:20:11] <MG2021> JEEB you guys always add support to the codecs that no one uses
[16:20:32] <JEEB> because it's often literally what someone has an interest to vOv
[16:20:44] <JEEB> welcome to open source
[16:20:55] <MG2021> most youtube videos are video game walkthroughs or game related
[16:20:56] <JEEB> someone fixed the VC-1 decoder because they wanted to watch their starcraft streams
[16:21:18] <MG2021> most of the game fmvs are bink video
[16:21:46] <MG2021> i wonder why the bink 2 still is not supported
[16:22:08] <JEEB> because whomever started the work either lost interest or has IRL things why he cannot prioritize finishing that work.
[16:22:27] <JEEB> at least you have a patch which partially does the job, so anyone can take that over should they care enough?
[16:22:35] <JEEB> like, I don't see the röplem
[16:22:53] <JEEB> if this was closed source you'd have nothing to start off or see that work had been done.
[16:23:54] <klaxa> you wouldn't even get multiple opinions, you would get an automated email saying "thank you for your feedback, it will be reviewed for consideration" and that will be the last you hear of it
[16:23:54] <MG2021> Doesn't the epic game behind the scenes threaten the members of ffmpeg that if they support this format, it will sue them?
[16:24:02] <JEEB> no?
[16:24:06] <JEEB> I mean, try hacking it yourself
[16:24:36] <JEEB> I think so far the only people who've sent any sort of lulz to FFmpeg developers have been Dolby. and that was funny enough for a format has an open specification available at ETSI
[16:26:22] <durandal_1707> MG2021: thank you for your feedback, it will be reviewed for consideration

[16:27:01] <MG2021> i hate dolby
[16:27:33] <JEEB> well the LAV Filters developer is one of the FFmpeg devs :P and yes, he most likely does not have the interest of finishing the decoder himself
[16:27:41] <JEEB> he is busy working on the DShow wrapper
[16:27:44] <JEEB> and his own $dayjob player etc
[16:28:14] <JEEB> and the only reason cash is ever mentioned is because if people cannot focus on something or do not have the interest in doing the tiring work of finishing the last 30-40% or whatever, it's the simplest way to support them. which is why you see people opening patreons or doing bounties where multiple people can chime in.
[16:28:33] <JEEB> you cannot gift people time
[16:29:07] <JEEB> but since it is open source, you have the alternative of just taking the code, taking Bink's stuff and seeing how the rest of the format works
[16:29:17] <JEEB> that's the beauty of it, if you care about the format enough
[16:29:18] <JEEB> :)
[16:29:26] <MG2021> they dont even let the mainconect to add directshow filter file (ax file) of dolby to use outside of the mainconcept products

[16:48:27] <MG2021> for crowdfunding
[16:52:31] <JEEB> alas, I have other interests and things that require my time :) and it in any case would be better if either a known bounty giver (like videolan) or the actual developer handled it. you can ask on #videolan or so if they would be open to adding a bounty for the format on their bounty page.
[16:52:31] <MG2021> JEEB is it possible to implement libplacebo in mpc-hc (clsid fork)
[16:52:47] <JEEB> yes, someone just needs to do the DShow renderer part
[16:53:01] <JEEB> I thought of it for the lulz since I used to do DShow in the past, but since I don't use DShow myself it's meh
[16:53:22] <JEEB> like, what's the fun in hacking on something like that if you're not going to use it yourself :P
[16:54:12] <JEEB> anyways, my priorities are to finish the d3d11 HDR stuff in libplacebo and making libplacebo rendering in mpv ("gpu-next") work on macOS :P
[16:54:28] <MG2021> Thank you for the information you provided and for your kind reply
[16:55:10] <MG2021> My question is why no one welcomes media foundation
[16:58:11] <JEEB> media foundation didn't seem to offer much. you'd have to make a player, then you'd have to make filters. funny enough FFmpeg has capability of doing encoding with media foundation
[16:58:21] <JEEB> you can use GPU HW encoders through MF :D
[16:58:31] <JEEB> too bad there's no direct d3d11 input support yet
[16:59:02] <JEEB> anyways, off for a nice jog outside

[19:10:50] <jokoon> So if I concat several stream and one doesn't have an audiotrack, is it going to "shift" the final audio ?

[19:21:44] <Ram-Z> Trying to convert a bunch of images into video useng `ffmpeg -f image2 -pattern_type glob -i "*.png" out.mkv`, however I get "Could not open file : 2022-03-20T15:57:00.png". The file exists and is readable by my user.
[19:21:49] <Ram-Z> Any ideas?

[19:24:47] <Ram-Z> https://pastesite.org/view/59f2b253
[19:33:14] <klaxa> is it properly a png file?
[19:33:16] <klaxa> >[image2 @ 0x5613b6f6b740] Could not find codec parameters for stream 0 (Video: png, none(pc)): unspecified size
[19:33:30] <klaxa> this sounds like the file magic header doesn't say png
[19:33:49] <klaxa> you can try with: file path/to/image.png
[19:35:08] <Ram-Z> 2022-03-20T15:57:00.png: PNG image data, 2080 x 1104, 8-bit/color RGB, non-interlaced
[19:35:13] <Ram-Z> feh opens it fine.
[19:35:37] <Ram-Z> I think that message is due to the previous "could not open file" error.

[19:43:34] <Ram-Z> Got it.
[19:43:52] <Ram-Z> Turns out ffmpeg does not like : in filenames.
[19:45:24] <Ram-Z> It may parse this as a protocol specifier, i.e. file:image.png or rtp://...
[19:45:41] <Ram-Z> Bit odd that it does this when using glob too.
[19:46:12] <Ram-Z> But anyway, doing `-i "./*.png" seems to force the protocol to file and remove the ambiguity.
[19:47:04] <durandal_1707> Ram-Z: you can escape it with \\\\

[19:47:30] <Ram-Z> I don't pass the colon, it's handled by the glob pattern.
[19:48:44] <Ram-Z> Which is why it's surprising that it causes issue. Since it succesfully globs assuming the pattern works on local files, then forgets that it's meant to be processing files.
[19:51:08] <Ram-Z> Could do some interiesting things by naming your files "udp://example.com" and "tcp://example.com" then using `glob -i "*"`. xD
