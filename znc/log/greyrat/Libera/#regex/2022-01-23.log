[03:34:19] <re101-fish-0> yeah, I was thinking the same,
[03:36:30] <re101-fish-0> looks like there is a case if we search below we might endup finding the other name which belongs to other image :(
[03:44:56] <re101-fish-0> do you know regex for extracting just "image: <>" part when there is comment succeeded by that, Ie; say image: nginx #comment Extracting only till nginx. I'm using image: (.*)
[03:45:34] <re101-fish-0> But it need to stop at optional character or special character '#'

[06:08:44] <digitok> 07mojtaba, do it in 2 steps
[06:10:13] <digitok> https://regex101.com/r/PmqxV2/5 and https://regex101.com/r/PmqxV2/6
[06:10:47] <digitok> step 1 returns the complete tag as the full match, and the tag name as group 1
[06:10:54] <digitok> apply step 2 to the full match
[06:11:06] <digitok> and it returns the attributes in group 1
[06:13:13] <mojtaba> digitok: Should I do that in the code? How can I mix these two together in the regex
[06:14:29] <digitok> you would do it in code, yes
[06:14:32] <digitok> using 2 regex
[06:16:01] <mojtaba> digitok: Thanks. I will try to fix it using 2 regex. But that would be awesome if there would be a way to do it once in a regex.
[06:17:00] *** Joins: pluri (~pluri@user/pluri)
[06:17:59] <digitok> where are you using the regex?
[06:18:25] <mojtaba> Python
[06:18:27] <mojtaba> digitok: 
[06:20:02] <digitok> how do you expect them to be returned?
[06:20:21] <digitok> how would you distinguish a tag from an attribute
[06:22:09] <mojtaba> digitok: a tag starts after < and anything inside is an attribute
[06:22:51] <digitok> i mean in the result
[06:23:14] <mojtaba> digitok: At the end I want a dictionary with the tag as the key and attributes as the list.
[06:24:54] <digitok> yea, the 2 steps would be the easiest route to achieving that
[06:26:10] <mojtaba> digitok: Thanks for your time
[06:27:18] <digitok> loop through the result of the first regex and create the dictionary key from group 1, then apply the second regex to group 0. then loop through the result of that and add group 1 to the dictionary list created in the parent loop
[06:27:23] <digitok> no problem
[06:29:08] <mojtaba> digitok: I am going to do that. :)
[06:29:16] <digitok> :)
[06:35:06] <mojtaba> digitok: In the second round we will end up with something like this:
[06:35:06] <mojtaba> <a atr1=sdflj source=lkjsflsjf another=ljadfljf>
[06:35:20] <digitok> yep
[06:35:34] <mojtaba> (\w+)(?==) this takes all the attributes
[06:35:40] <mojtaba> how can I get the tag at the same time?
[06:35:52] <digitok> you already have the tag
[06:35:56] <digitok> from step 1
[06:36:15] <mojtaba> aha
[06:36:18] <mojtaba> yes
[06:36:50] <digitok> with the second regex, you can use either 07(\w+)= or  \w+(?==)
[06:37:06] <digitok> you do not really need both the group and the lookahead
[06:37:18] <digitok> if you use the latter, the attributes will be in group 0
[06:38:14] <mysticspiral[m]> re101-fish-0: we need to find a pattern
[06:38:37] <mojtaba> digitok: Is it possible to have optional lookahead? just in general
[06:39:25] <digitok> what do you mean by optional
[06:39:35] <digitok> usually if a lookahead is optional, you do not need one :p
[06:40:00] <mojtaba> sometimes you want it be there, sometimes not
[06:41:23] <digitok> then in the first case, you would use one, and in the second case not
[06:41:28] <digitok> i would need an example to say for sure
[06:42:05] <digitok> brb though
[06:42:19] <mojtaba> let say, if we consider the tag attribute example, some of the tags have attributes and some do not.
[06:42:41] <mojtaba> I am just curious to see how to deal with that.
[06:42:45] <mojtaba> digitok: 
[06:43:57] <mysticspiral[m]> re101-fish-0: im thinking about limiting each search to blocks of same indentation. do you think that could work or would be there edge cases?
[06:44:39] <re101-fish-0> yea, possibly, looking at that
[06:46:02] <mysticspiral[m]> i would treat the leading dashes as space
[06:50:02] <re101-fish-0> Yep, If nothing works, I'm thinking to process it line by line
[06:53:48] <mojtaba> digitok: There is a little problem with doing it in two steps, and it is you cannot find out which attributes belong to which tag!
[06:54:10] <mojtaba> We have all the tags in the first run, and all the attributes on the second run.
[06:55:32] <mysticspiral[m]> re101-fish-0: line by line?

[07:03:34] <digitok> an array of arrays, or whatever python gives you
[07:04:09] <digitok> from the first internal array, you create a dictionary with [1] as the key and pass [0] to a second loop to extract the attributes

[14:31:47] <sine> hey folks. back from yesterday. I want to match <Warrior>. When I use regex101.com the [<]Warrior> seems to match perfect, but why?
[14:39:06] <digitok> why not?
[14:39:14] <digitok> the [] is not required
[14:46:47] <purplex> in regex [ and ] aren't literally matched that way as you may think @sine
[15:06:51] <sine> this is an example of some of the working regex that is being used by the c plugin for amxx
[15:06:55] <sine> \bn[e3i1\W_]+g[geal\W_\d]+[rt]s?\b
[15:07:29] <sine>  /<Warrior> Player/gm
[15:07:41] <sine> so when i tried that direct from regex101 its obviously not working
[15:08:22] <sine> I will do the slashes the other way around, but what is the b at the end
[15:09:52] <sine> i also know that [anything in here]
[15:13:30] <sine> ok I have read the top google post on cheatsheet and its all coming back to me

[15:14:10] <sine> i for that after \ the letter is not part of the alphanumerical match
[15:14:46] <sine>  \b (boudaries) n [ e or 3 or i or 1 or underscore ]
[15:15:17] <sine> this is an example to remove racist names btw its not some jokes im pasting
