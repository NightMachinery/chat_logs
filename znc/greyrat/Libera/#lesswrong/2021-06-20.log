[08:12:38] <gwern> sounds like that's the idea. ultra dry, ultra cold, perchlorates and all sorts of nasty gunk which has no liquid water to carry it away or react it with anything...

[08:16:56] <gwern> I was wondering if he's underestimating them. the umlauts etc may be an attempt to screw with the anti-plagiarism. if it worked, he wouldn't necessarily realize it, assuming they plagiarized plausible text
[08:17:31] <gwern> when I think screwing with anti-plagiarism, using variant punctuation, unicode alternatives, nonprinting etc are all things that come to mind to defeat string matches and n-grams

[08:18:34] <spxtr> Any advice on learning how to write well?
[08:19:01] <spxtr> (unrelated, turns out 200mg of caffeine daily is enough for me to get withdrawl 5 days later :( )

[08:39:33] <quanticle> They bring this mixture of milk and water to a rolling boil and... they just pour the tea right into that
[08:39:38] <quanticle> Right into the boiling milk!
[08:39:48] <spxtr> oh yeah I do that when I make spiced chai
[08:40:06] <spxtr> only problem is you can get a milk skin that some people don't like
[08:40:18] <quanticle> I don't like it, but that's not my primary objection

[08:40:54] <spxtr> hah
[08:41:22] <quanticle> Like you want to do that with Red Label CTC whatever fine
[08:41:27] <lizzie> I bring water to a boil (in a mason jar, in a microwave oven), steep the tea, remove the teabag and give it like 20 minutes to cool, and then add milk
[08:41:29] <quanticle> That tea is shit anyway, you can't ruin it more
[08:41:42] <quanticle> lizzie: No, that's fine
[08:41:46] <quanticle> That's just British tea
[08:41:48] <lizzie> yay!
[08:42:08] <spxtr> 20 mins seems excessive though, no? do you like lukewarm tea?
[08:42:08] <lizzie> well a lot of my European friends have hissy fits about me using a microwave instead of owning a proper kettle.
[08:42:22] <quanticle> But why do you add the milk *after* it's cooled? If you add cold milk, that would cool the tea faster and you wouldn't need to wait twenty minutes.
[08:42:26] <lizzie> spxtr: I do like lukewarm tea!  and I add a bunch of milk, so it gets a little chilly even
[08:42:41] <spxtr> slightly blasphemous, but to each their own
[08:42:47] <lizzie> quanticle: by adding cold milk after it has cooled already, I can get it to a lower temperature than it would otherwise cool to
[08:42:56] <quanticle> I mean... boiling water is boiling water; yes, a kettle is more *efficient* at boiling water, but it's not like there's anything magical about water boiled in a kettle as opposed to a microwave.
[08:43:45] <lizzie> I think they are mostly just being traditionalists.  Not many of my friends are superstitious about things like microwaves.
[08:44:58] <lizzie> spxtr: what temperature do you like your tea?
[08:45:25] <spxtr> depends on the tea. Good black/oolong/green tea usually I drink as close to boiling as possible
[08:45:34] <spxtr> Some japanese green teas prefer cooler water
[08:45:54] <quanticle> I'm a fan of lukewarm tea; I cool my tea 15 minutes before I drink it
[08:46:12] <quanticle> Brew tea, add sugar, wait 15 minutes, drink
[08:46:34] <spxtr> For cheap black tea I brew, add sugar, add ~20ml milk to a cup's worth of tea
[08:46:49] <spxtr> still drink hot but it cools a bit from the milk
[08:49:05] <lizzie> I go 50/50 with my tea and milk.  Is that blasphemous yet quanticle?
[08:49:25] <quanticle> I mean, I dunno, I go pretty much 50-50 with milk and coffee when I make coffee
[08:49:31] <lizzie> me too!
[08:49:32] <quanticle> Some of my co-workers find that blasphemous
[08:49:37] <lizzie> many people seem to
[08:49:50] <quanticle> But as a result, I can't really say that what you're doing with tea is blasphemous, if that makes sense?
[08:50:09] <quanticle> Personally I drink tea with just sugar
[08:50:37] <lizzie> sure you can!  The whole point of using religion-words like "blasphemous" is that you don't have to follow any of the rules of rational discourse.  Blasphemy is whatever you say it is (well, actually it's whatever *I* say it is)

[08:51:45] <lizzie> If you call milk in tea blasphemous, I'll call sugar in tea blasphemous.  Deal?
[08:51:59] <spxtr> of course the vast majority of the tea I drink is in super fancy yixing teapots with boiling water and no added milk/sugar, because I'm not some heathen
[08:52:08] <spxtr> (somewhat /s)
[08:52:26] <lizzie> the vast majority of my tea is boxes of store-brand teabags from my local grocery store
[08:52:40] <rmmh> spxtr: how do you feel about high-altitude brewing
[08:52:59] <rmmh> if I set my teapot to 212F it will just boil all the water away, ever yearning for a temperature it cannot reach...
[08:53:12] <lizzie> when I try to get "fancy" tea it's a real crap shoot, because sometimes I really like it, but more often it leaves my mouth confused.  To enjoy fancy tea properly, I'd have to spend significant effort actually finding the teas I like.

[08:53:19] <lizzie> And then I'd just have less money.
[08:53:32] <quanticle> Boil tea at 100¬∫C even at altitude
[08:53:55] <rmmh> that's a decent physics problem
[08:54:00] <quanticle> lizzie: Yeah, I've had that problem
[08:54:24] <quanticle> I ordered this Nepali tea once, which was very highly rated, and brewed to an extremely pretty golden color
[08:54:30] <quanticle> And then when I drank it
[08:54:32] <quanticle> Disappointment
[08:54:43] <quanticle> It wasn't even that it tasted bad... it was just that it was weak
[08:54:55] <quanticle> And when I tried to use more or brewed it longer it got bitter
[08:54:58] <quanticle> le sigh
[08:55:00] <rmmh> You have a pressure cooker with 1L of water at 10PSI and 240F. You vent it, causing water to rapidly evaporate. How much water is left after venting, and what is its temperature?
[08:55:10] <spxtr> rmmh: I visited a tea farmer at 2000m elevation, he unambiguously said that tea tastes worse at altitude
[08:55:21] <spxtr> because the water doesn't get as hot up there

[08:56:19] <lizzie> tell us more!
[08:56:24] <gwern> folk theory is that it's something to do with oxygenation: bubbles forming in direct heating but not when microwaved. sort of like supersaturation
[08:56:49] <lizzie> would that mean that microwaved water de-oxygenates *less*?
[08:57:07] <lizzie> I would call that a win for microwave tea, if so
[08:57:14] <spxtr> at 100 C there is basically no oxygen in the water, I thought?

[08:57:19] <gwern> and I believe it myself because when I went off to college and started making all my tea by nuking a glass travel mug, I immediately noticed it was somehow *off*, and then I went looking online and found out this was widely believed
[08:57:56] <lizzie> okay so it's better with the kettle?
[08:57:59] <gwern> I mean, it sounds kinda bizarre. but you'd say that of putting tea in and then milk vs milk then tea, and, well...
[08:58:12] <lizzie> I need to get ahold of a kettle and experiment on myself
[08:58:21] <gwern> yes, kettle is much better
[08:58:26] <rmmh> experiment on water. it's less painful
[08:58:54] <lizzie> the thing I heard about tea and milk or vice versa seems to relate to the degree to which the lipids in the milk get denatured
[08:59:00] <gwern> I haven't experimented with it myself because it's hard to properly control and get them simultaneously
[08:59:07] <lizzie> so my solution, of letting my tea cool long before I add milk, eliminates that
[08:59:32] <gwern> and I think my electric kettle is faster than microwave anyway so I've had little motivation to try to figure out if it's a real difference and how it can be improved
[08:59:50] <lizzie> I'm sure your electric kettle brings a cup of water to a boil faster than your microwave does :P
[09:00:10] <lizzie> it's inherently more efficient and better at the job
[09:00:18] <spxtr> I've only found 3 sellers in the US that consistently have good tea.
[09:00:23] <rmmh> I wonder if you can get 240V appliance microwaves 
[09:00:50] <lizzie> maybe just some kind of laser
[09:01:05] <spxtr> Floating Leaves in Seattle, The Chinese Tea Shop in Vancouver (counts as US), and some place in LA that I used to buy from but I'm blanking on the name.
[09:01:09] <lizzie> gwern: okay, so is the theory that you *do* want more bubbles to travel through the water?  would microwaving water for longer, and letting it reach a rolling boil, help?
[09:01:27] <lizzie> or even using some kind of agitator to make sure it bubbles better
[09:01:51] <gwern> if you use an agitator, you're running more air/oxygen through it and reoxygenating it, making it not go flat
[09:02:01] <lizzie> Vancouver counts as US? xD
[09:02:27] <lizzie> I don't mean vigorous stirring, just something to bump against the jar to shake bubbles loose
[09:02:37] <gwern> I'm not entirely sure whether it's about the bubbles or if microwave heating extracts more gas somehow by uniform heating - maybe the unevenness of direct heating surfaces is critical?
[09:03:22] <gwern> if the heat is forcing out dissolved gas and that makes the taste difference, then microwaved water would heat uniformly and squeeze it out uniformyl, so by the time the entire water boils simultaneously... this reminds me of the problem of supersplashing microwaved things
[09:03:53] <gwern> ie the liquid seems to not be boiling and to be safe, and then when slightly disturbed, *blam* boiling liquid everywhere
[09:04:13] <lizzie> yeah I am well familiar with that effect
[09:04:27] <lizzie> usually when I make my tea, I carefully drop in the tea bag and stand back, because the water is just a bit superheated and violently boils around the tea bag
[09:04:34] <spxtr> this is a fairly easy thing to do a blind test on
[09:04:36] <lizzie> it entertains me
[09:04:59] <lizzie> to do a blind test on by yourself?
[09:05:06] <spxtr> get a friend to help
[09:05:12] <lizzie> right, that would work
[09:05:16] <lizzie> I wonder if I could talk my dad into it
[09:05:39] <quanticle> spxtr: Three? Who's the third?
[09:06:06] <quanticle> Floating leaves, Upton and... ?
[09:06:34] <quanticle> Ah, Vancouver
[09:06:39] <spxtr> Floating Leaves, The Chinese Tea Shop, and Tea Habitat
[09:07:01] <quanticle> Yeah, that's fair
[09:07:14] <quanticle> Upton has a wide selection but it's up to you to figure out which of their teas are good and which suck
[09:07:24] <spxtr> Upton is a pretty good deal for okay-ish tea, but they don't have anything particularly good
[09:07:35] <spxtr> I use them for bulk black tea orders
[09:07:58] <quanticle> Yeah, they don't have anything like the aged Tie-guan-yin that Floating Leaves does.
[09:11:25] <gwern> upton's has gone a bit downhill over the past 2-3 years. feels like the tea is just not as good, and lots of shortages or stockouts. I wonder if they're having supply problems or something and losing good connects
[09:12:03] <spxtr> Oh I forgot I also like Charaku for Japanese tea. The guy who owns it is super nice as well.

[10:56:37] <Guest9> i want to store data for 2 projects(A & B), data is not so big that it cant be visually impossible to see. around 20 columns -100 rows for each project.  Out of 20 let us says 10+ columns are same across A & B. 5+ columns are slightly different (or can be derived from vice versa) & rest columns(~5) are completely different.  in this case, while
[10:56:37] <Guest9> entering data, i feel Master sheet containing both A & B project data is quite useful. but when data is ready and  i want to send to others, i need to separate them into each file/spreadsheet.so what is best way out?the story doesnt end here. when others suggest me some changes, sometimes it is better to work on INDIVIDUAL sheet (INSTEAD OF
[10:56:37] <Guest9> MASTER). while sometimes (based on type of feedback/comments from others), it is better to work on master sheet so that i can have both project A & B in front of my eyes in a single page. am i making some sense?

[19:31:39] <Robomot> Navy denies student scholarship based on autism diagnosis | wusa9.com (Tory Ridgeway was accepted to Embry-Riddle University on a full NROTC Scholarship in April. In June, that scholarship was rescinded because of his autism diagnosis.)
[19:32:55] <feep> .. how does that make sense
[19:33:10] <two2thehead> policy inertia
[19:33:39] <two2thehead> "
[19:33:39] <two2thehead> The Navy cited Tory's autism diagnosis as a reason for the denial. A diagnosis he was upfront about throughout his entire application. In fact, it was the focus of his admissions essay. 
[19:33:39] <two2thehead> "He talked about how proud he was of all of his accomplishments as a child of autism," said his mom, Vanessa Ridgeway. 
[19:33:39] <two2thehead> The ROTC acceptance letter says the scholarship is contingent on several things, including being medically qualified. After the Navy received his medical records, they denied him, citing his autism. 
[19:33:43] <two2thehead> "It's very difficult to just find something else when you've spend two-thirds of your life going for something and then right when you have it in your hand, it's yanked away from you," said Tory Ridgeway. 
[19:33:46] <two2thehead> "

[19:52:43] <dbohdan> Yes, perfect
[19:53:12] <two2thehead> "The British also blundered while trying to counterfeit enemy Turkish banknotes during WWI. They went to great pains to produce a very good imitation of the genuine note, and then ruined the entire effect by printing some numbers facing in the wrong direction. The story was first reported by Scott Cordry in an article entitled  "World War I counterfeits of German and Turkish notes," Coin World, July 13, 1988." huh
[19:57:14] <two2thehead> "The stamp is an excellent NAZI propaganda production. It implies that the British are fighting the war for the Jews and the Communists and is full of small symbols of Communism and Jewry. The visual image and message are quite striking. There is one problem however, the spelling of the word "Jewish." The forgers left out the "I."
[19:57:15] <two2thehead> There was some talk after the war that this might have been a secret plan by the Jewish forgers to sabotage the design and embarrass the Nazis. I spoke to Bernhard Kr√ºger on several occasions and he told me that it was just "a terrible printing error. The word 'Jewish' had been translated properly but the engraver omitted the letter 'I.' The mistake was spotted and there was an attempt to halt production. However, the SS hierarchy decided to push

[19:59:07] <two2thehead> kuudes, s0ph1a feep : Trading cards are universal both in time and space: "We would be remiss if we did not mention the use of sexual images on leaflets. American policy was generally against such images, but the Axis powers of Germany and Japan used them quite often. The theory is that a lonesome GI thousands of miles from home will find the propaganda leaflet showing a naked female, think of his wife or girlfriend, lose the will to fight, and be 
[19:59:07] <two2thehead> virtually worthless as a soldier. In reality, the result was quite different. Many troops were bored as they waited for the next battle or sat behind the lines in reserve. The sudden appearance of thousands of photographs or drawings of naked women falling from the sky was quite exciting. The Germans often dropped the leaflets in numbered sets of six. As the leaflets fell or lay scattered on the ground, the soldiers would go from leaflet to leaflet, 
[19:59:08] <two2thehead> trying to complete the sets. If a buddy had a leaflet that was needed, a trade would be made, not unlike the old bubblegum or trading cards. In some cases there were reports of cigarettes and other commodities traded for the sex leaflets. The result seems to be that instead of lowering the morale of the troops, the use of sexual leaflets actually raises the morale."

We call this approach GDumb (Greedy Sampler and Dumb Learner). As the name suggest, the two core components of our approach are a greedy sampler and a dumb learner. Given a memory budget, the sampler greedily stores samples from a data-stream while making sure that 
[20:39:48] <lool0> the classes are balanced, and, at inference, the learner (neural network) is trained from scratch (hence dumb) using all the samples stored in the memory. When tested on a variety of scenarios on which various recent works have proposed highly tuned algorithms, GDumb surprisingly provides state-of-the-art results with large margins in almost all the cases. The fact that GDumb, even though not designed to 
[20:39:48] <lool0> handle the intricacies in the challenging CL problems, outperforms recently proposed algorithms in their own experimental set-ups, is alarming.

[23:53:35] <shawwwn> The vague ‚Äúbut AI might hurt‚Äù is all I can seem to find
[23:54:19] <shawwwn> Yes, it might. Or it might not. Your body might also teleport forward one foot in the next ten seconds. Physics allows for that; the probability is not zero
[23:54:35] <shawwwn> But it‚Äôs sufficiently zero that we say it‚Äôs impossible, and we‚Äôre not often wrong
[23:54:50] <spxtr> These models are effectively their IP, they plan to publish more papers using them and they don't want to get scooped.
[23:55:00] <shawwwn> I feel the same way about lesswrong‚Äôs AI concerns as I do towards the teleportation example.
[23:55:15] <shawwwn> spxtr: exactly. Papers have become tech demos
[23:55:27] <shawwwn> It‚Äôs no longer science. It‚Äôs a demo.
[23:55:35] <spxtr> It can be both.
[23:55:54] <shawwwn> I would love it if that were true. But it doesn‚Äôt seem to be.
[23:56:01] <shawwwn> A core tenet of science is that others can verify your results
[23:56:10] <shawwwn> No model release, no verification.
[23:56:35] <spxtr> This is something that's extremely frustrating for me in physics, theorists will publish papers describing models that I can't reproduce because they didn't release the code and their paper has errors.
[23:56:50] <shawwwn> It‚Äôs really that simple. But people seem to dress it up as something else, or dismiss it, or otherwise ignore it
[23:56:51] <spxtr> And they refuse to share the code when asked.
[23:56:55] <shawwwn> Yes.
[23:57:19] <shawwwn> So it‚Äôs like‚Ä¶ is ML just following in the footsteps of physics? Are we crazy for expecting verifiable results?
[23:57:32] <shawwwn> Empirically, physics has the same sorts of problems
[23:57:59] <spxtr> Oh no I don't think anyone is following in anyone's footsteps. Science has just grown hypercompetitive and publication count is all that matters.
[23:58:07] <shawwwn> Mm.
[23:58:26] <spxtr> Roughly the same thing is happening in every field of science as far as I can tell.
[23:59:28] <shawwwn> Then I suppose it must be science
[23:59:36] <shawwwn> Otherwise it would be done differently
