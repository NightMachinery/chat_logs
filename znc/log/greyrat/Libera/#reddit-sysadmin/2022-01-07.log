[03:57:19] <matiss> so, this is fun
[03:57:47] <matiss> I accidentally stumbled on to a something on af.mil that exists, and should not
[03:58:01] <matiss> been looking for how to report it for like an hour now
[03:58:22] <xe0n> just ignore it and move on
[03:59:14] <matiss> now the fun part is, I found this thing called VDP, a vulnerability disclosure program for DoD. But. When you go to contact us, " This link is not to be used to report vulnerabilities on DoD networks and systems."
[03:59:22] <matiss> and no mention where SHOULD it be reported
[04:00:20] <matiss> and the only somewhat relevant link I could find actually leads to hackerone lol
[04:00:45] <matiss> I shit you not, https://www.dc3.mil/Organizations/Vulnerability-Disclosure/Vulnerability-Disclosure-Program-VDP/ there is a button there and it goes to hackerone
[04:02:22] <matiss> and to think these people have access to nukes, I mean

[04:50:16] <Hobadee> Hey - what's the rough spread of what MSPs charge companies?
[04:50:27] <xe0n> that's a broad question lol!
[04:50:41] <Hobadee> xe0n, I know.  I'm looking for a broad answer!
[04:50:55] <xe0n> depends what services they provide, and what costs the msp needs to cover
[04:51:00] <Hobadee> ...related, I put in my 2-weeks notice and my company is shitting bricks and asking me to find an MSP to replace me.
[04:51:13] <xe0n> not your problem lol!
[04:51:42] <Hobadee> Hey, I'm still in their employ for just over 1 more week.  If they want me to find an MSP, I'll do that.
[04:52:27] <Hobadee> I'm finding it hilarious actually.  The look on their face as the gears are turning about what I'm doing, then the slow spread of sheer dread over their face as they realize what my leaving means is priceless.
[04:53:36] <xe0n> msps will charge per workstation\agent\device, possibly how many users they need to manage\costs of providing professional services etc
[04:53:44] <xe0n> and what type of professional services they will need to provide
[04:54:16] <xe0n> onboarding will take more than a week lol
[04:54:27] <xe0n> so the best you can do is put them in touch with someone at an msp, and then let them sort out the details

[06:23:18] <BWMerlin> Have already explained about staff leaving
[06:23:33] <xe0n> part of offboarding should be transfer of ownership

[10:03:52] <JollyRgrs> obviously some ppl
[10:04:01] <JollyRgrs> i've seen it before, but it has been a long while
[10:04:40] <JollyRgrs> ugh, can i just tell spotify not to play coldplay. pls?
[10:04:57] <epony> why are you torturing yourself..
[10:04:57] <JollyRgrs> the offspring, linkin park... then coldplay?
[10:05:03] <JollyRgrs> spotify generated playlist
[10:05:07] <JollyRgrs> mostly pretty good
[10:05:15] <epony> spotty ;-)
[10:05:17] <epony> in patches
[10:05:30] <JollyRgrs> but srsly, just b/c the music came out in the same era, pls don't think that the offspring should be followed up by coldplay
[10:05:44] <SirSceptalot> I think Tidal lets you downvote stuff so it no longer shows in auto-generated playlists
[10:06:00] <JollyRgrs> yeah, almost everything does, cept spotify
[10:06:05] <epony> technically they are 5years apart and incompatible
[10:06:13] <JollyRgrs> i think there's a way to block an artist, but it's a PITA
[10:06:35] <epony> so your complaint is really valid, but is online streaming "any good"?
[10:06:46] <JollyRgrs> ...
[10:06:55] <JollyRgrs> here's epony being dumb again
[10:07:28] <epony> hay, it's not me with the streaming "problem" ;-)
[10:07:34] <JollyRgrs> 5 yrs apart? the offspring was making music before/after coldplay... so there was a time they both were on radio as "current" artists (not same station hopefully)
[10:07:44] <JollyRgrs> and yeah, i like online streaming
[10:07:47] <SirSceptalot> online streaming is convenient
[10:07:52] <epony> duh

[10:07:55] <SirSceptalot> but I do miss buying cd's
[10:07:56] <A-KO> what's up JollyRgrs?
[10:07:59] <JollyRgrs> i have a personal catalog of about 20k songs or so... but i like streaming as well
[10:08:01] <JollyRgrs> hey A-KO 
[10:08:05] <JollyRgrs> SirSceptalot: i do, too
[10:08:23] <SirSceptalot> My biggest gripe is kind of being at the mercy of the streaming services
[10:08:41] <epony> see, "don't be dunb" policy ;-)
[10:08:50] <A-KO> I just think it's funny that we're finally now getting back to "lossless" (CD Audio Quality) music on itunes....
[10:08:55] <SirSceptalot> I discovered a new artist a little while back, added it to a playlist, and the next week spotify said "lol, can't play that anymore"
[10:09:07] * SirSceptalot shudders
[10:09:17] <A-KO> and for most people still isn't lossless because they use bluetooth for everything--which is lossy
[10:09:22] <SirSceptalot> itunes...
[10:09:42] <SirSceptalot> eeeeeeeeeeeeeeh
[10:09:55] <SirSceptalot> I have some good sony earbuds (BT) and it sounds fine
[10:10:05] <A-KO> sure, sounds fine, but is still lossy :P
[10:10:10] <SirSceptalot> and yeah, I know BT doesn't have realy lossless codecs
[10:10:23] <SirSceptalot> but it sounds good
[10:10:42] <epony> remember "it's just a bunch of lists of categories and years with inclusive and exclusive single/multilpe sub-lists"

[10:10:48] <epony> so, not a computer problem

[11:41:32] <sd> 15<P​andaBear> It recommends it only for cold files, is it because the compression reduces performance when opening them

[11:47:40] <lancehead> all that + car would've been like 70K here

[12:08:03] <lancehead> xD
[12:08:12] <CableNinja> by the time you properly upgrade that car from an m3 engine/transmission swap you might as well have bought an M3 and stuck the gas cap from a 318 on it
[12:08:31] <lancehead> lol pretty much. It'll still be a bit cheaper though
[12:08:40] <lancehead> And a cool-ass sleeper build
[12:08:41] <CableNinja> engine and transmission upgrades mean also upgrading brakes and shocks/struts/sway/rollbars, etc
[12:08:56] <CableNinja> after all of that you'll have spent as much as a regular M3
[12:09:10] <lancehead> The uniqueness is a definite factor in me wanting to convert a 318i, and getting experience working on a car
[12:09:20] <lancehead> Will be worth in the end :p
[12:09:29] <CableNinja> Im not sayin dont do it, but just... you know.. money... if moneys tight spending a bunch of it on a swap like that
[12:09:32] <Oliber> if you DIY the work, it's cheaper, if you are paying someone to do it - it's cheaper to buy the M3
[12:09:55] <CableNinja> if you account for your own hourly wage while doing the work, it can end up more expensive :)
[12:10:25] <lancehead> CableNinja: My chances of immediately getting a sys/network admin job out of school are pretty decent where I live, which is what I'm counting on. The civic is my "money is tight" alternative ;) 
[12:10:40] <CableNinja> IE: if the mechanic charges me $40/hour, and I make $30, sure, its cheaper, but if I make more than the mechanic, diy is technically costing me more

[12:12:52] <lancehead> It's still an M3, but cooler
[12:13:44] <SirSceptalot> lol
[12:13:45] <SirSceptalot> yes
[12:14:06] <lancehead> Look up the M3 GTR

[13:45:22] <yuken> Huh. I can't seem to find any standing desks that don't aren't sit-stand.
[13:45:26] <yuken> I just want a cheap desk that doesn't move.
[13:49:50] <nobyk> Just get a table top and some legs at ikea
[13:50:09] <nobyk> Basically my standing desk
[13:50:30] <DrZak> yea
[13:50:35] <DrZak> wait 
[13:50:38] <DrZak> how 
[13:50:45] <DrZak> the regular legs arent high enough
[13:50:59] <SirSceptalot> they will be for yuken DrZak 
[13:51:06] <DrZak> oh, right
[13:51:32] <DrZak> or buy a couple 2x4 and stick them under
[13:51:46] <yuken> lol fuck you SirSceptalot 
[13:51:55] <SirSceptalot> :D
[13:52:25] <DrZak> the ikea adjustable tables have really shit stability
[13:52:32] <yuken> I don't need anything adjustable :P
[13:52:36] <DrZak> tbh. you might simply have a joiner do it
[13:52:40] <yuken> It's for a table in the corner of my room for stuff.
[13:52:41] <DrZak> woodworker
[13:54:03] <DrZak> i mean, ikea tables get to 85-90 cm max
[13:54:34] <DrZak> that's not enough to stand
[13:55:03] <DrZak> perhaps simply screw the table into the wall without legs
[13:55:08] <nobyk> My table goes like.. up to my chest almost
[13:55:26] <DrZak> unless the wall is made out of cardboard
[13:56:09] <nobyk> I did both
[13:56:10] <nobyk> It's great

[13:56:27] <nobyk> It's full of crap tho
[13:56:32] <nobyk> Should uh.. take care of that some day
[13:57:37] <yuken> Can't do that, DrZak.
[13:57:48] <yuken> Surely there are just some prefab standing tables.
[13:58:00] <DrZak> that's what i plan, put in sturdy triangular braces, with piston-like structure, so i dont have to vacuum around the legs like an idiot
[13:58:10] <DrZak> put the monitor on vesa arm bolted to the wall
[13:58:14] <DrZak> job's done
[13:58:45] <DrZak> yuken: i didnt find anything cheap, i was searching for a tall table, and nada
[13:58:55] <DrZak> at least in the regular european stores
[13:58:59] <CoJaBo> So, apparently we run a news agregator. Added a new feature today showing when an article is outdated. The JWST was fully deployed over 107 years ago. Apparently, our date parsing sucks.
[13:59:33] <SirSceptalot> either that or you were really ahead of your time
[13:59:42] <DrZak> maybe they scanned in their old articles?
[13:59:51] <CoJaBo> It's been parsing the first 4-digit number beginning with 19 or 20 as a date :/
[13:59:51] <yuken> DrZak, https://www.amazon.com/Sauder-420042-North-Avenue-Table/dp/B07GG7WJZF might actually work for me.
[13:59:55] <CoJaBo> For years. Wasn't reported til tonight tho
[14:00:34] <CoJaBo> It was less noticable that the date was wrong until we started claiming current events were decades or more old lol
[14:00:36] <DrZak> that seems sorta, thin
[14:01:12] <yuken> I really dgaf about that. It will have no heavy weight on it.

[16:52:41] <yuken> teh_f4ll3n, you can actually buy a tank like that and not have to disarm it here in the US.
[16:52:43] <yuken> Which is pretty pog.
[16:53:04] <yuken> Imagine driving an armed tank to work.
[16:53:19] <Kiernian> armed? pretty sure you can't do *that* part
[16:53:26] <yuken> You can, Kiernian.
[16:53:44] <Kiernian> every one I've ever seen for sale has been de-armed for legal reasons
[16:53:46] <yuken> The cannon is considered a "destructive device" and just need a $200 tax.
[16:53:52] <Kiernian> huh
[16:53:57] <yuken> Kiernian, because that makes it easier to handle. If it's armed, you just need to pay a small tax.
[16:54:03] <yuken> sorry, "tax" (extortion fee)
[16:54:13] <yuken> With it disarmed, you don't need to involve the federal government at all.
[16:54:42] <Kiernian> yeah, okay, that makes sense. I figured it was just "differently legal in some states" so they just went the easy route

[18:20:05] <SirSceptalot> his about 165kg
[18:20:21] <SirSceptalot> so we put 120 on the bar, 10 times each, and just repeated untill someone gave up
[18:20:38] <SirSceptalot> that was not a good idea

[18:22:17] <SirSceptalot> i'm 173cm and just below 90kg

[20:44:44] <CptLuxx> to make an iso
[20:44:45] <CptLuxx> magic
[20:44:50] <int0x1C8> oh
[20:45:33] <Oliber> why do you need to boot from media, if you can install the app and it performs the operation at next boot if it can't do it live? (it probably can do it live as well)
[20:45:57] <int0x1C8> move the system protected recovery partition? no
[20:46:31] <int0x1C8> bootable media? unlock advanced features.
[20:46:49] <CptLuxx> <CptLuxx> aomei? or  minitool?
[20:46:49] <int0x1C8> this is why I asked for ones like gparted, FOSS not this freeware bullshit
[20:47:04] <int0x1C8> aoemei is paid
[20:47:11] <CptLuxx> there is a freeeeee verion
[20:47:24] <int0x1C8> the freeeeeeeeeeeeee version doesn't let me create bootable media
[20:48:16] <CptLuxx> not sure if troll
[20:48:22] <CptLuxx> just for fun i  installed the free version
[20:48:26] <CptLuxx> and just made an iso
[20:48:44] <int0x1C8> aomei or minitool?
[20:48:47] <CptLuxx> ha
[20:48:52] <CptLuxx> it picked up my old license
[20:48:53] <CptLuxx> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[20:50:57] <Oliber> apparently - with minitool, you can move the recovery parition just fine (instructions sound like without bootable media required) - https://www.tenforums.com/general-support/42426-recovery-partition-getting-way-extending-c-partition.html

[21:19:18] <PrincessZoey> I may FINALLY have permissions to actually do stuff at work today

[21:25:46] <PrincessZoey> natively 
[21:25:59] <Kiernian> pc makers have microsoft's permission to install windows on ARM processors all day long
[21:26:02] <Kiernian> YOU just can't do it
[21:26:10] <DrZak> oh
[21:26:24] <PrincessZoey> I'm stuck running windows 11 for ARM in parallels 
[21:26:27] <DrZak> mac and arm
[21:26:38] <DrZak> its so funny
[21:26:46] <PrincessZoey> why? it's stupid fast
[21:27:04] <DrZak> yea
[21:27:18] <PrincessZoey> https://i.imgur.com/5kyVEA5.png
[21:27:34] <DrZak> and of course if you plan on watching movies, browsing web and listening to music, its gwesome
[21:27:49] <Kiernian> I feel like if I had an m1 mac I'd want way more than 16gb of ram
[21:27:55] <Kiernian> 32 at least
[21:27:57] <DrZak> except no software vendor gives two shits about arm
[21:27:58] <DrZak> :)
[21:28:21] <PrincessZoey> doesn't matter DrZak, rosetta means any x86 app runs just fine
[21:28:52] <PrincessZoey> I can't tell this is arm except the first time I ran an intel app
[21:29:41] <Kiernian> that brings up a valid point. how is processor architecture still a thing with this much power under the hood? I mean, I guess the answer is "it's not if you have the right abstraction layer between the hardware and software" but I feel like it should be even less of an issue than it is
[21:29:56] <Kiernian> after all, no developer worth any amount of money bothers to optimize a damn thing anymore
[21:29:59] <PrincessZoey> and Kiernian yeah it's biting me in the ass, lol. I may sell it and get a 32gb one 
[21:30:01] <Kiernian> they just throw more hardware at their code
[21:30:23] <Kiernian> so if that's the going principle, how necessary is direct hardware access anyway?
[21:30:50] <DrZak> coz then things eat a lot of electricity
[21:30:56] <DrZak> but yea, that's the current world
[21:31:10] <DrZak> instead of fixing things, do workarounds
[21:31:23] <DrZak> and cheap tricks
[21:31:49] <DrZak> if vendors released arm versions of software, it would be great

[21:33:07] <Kiernian> right, so the whole reason to care about hardware level access was the sheer level of SPEED and control you got working at low level.
