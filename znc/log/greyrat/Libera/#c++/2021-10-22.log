[00:26:48] <nolyc> Undefined reference is a linker error. It's not a compile error. #includes don't help. You did not define the thing in the error message, you forgot to link the file that defines it, you forgot to link to the library that defines it, or, if it's a static library, you have the wrong order on the linker command line. Check which one. (Note that some linkers call it an unresolved external)

[00:47:59] <cbreak> if you use a singleton, don't hide it

[00:50:07] <tin-> cbreak: hm, i don't think I understand
[00:50:44] <RandomReader> the description implies a user would do:   auto mydb = dbservice();
[00:50:54] <RandomReader> but whatever they do with mydb, underneath it's using a singleton
[00:50:56] <RandomReader> that's unexpected in a bad way
[00:51:23] <RandomReader> it looks like they have their very own "mydb", not like they have a shared master_db

[00:53:06] <cbreak> avoid singletons unless you really need what they offer

[01:56:41] <Raziel> Lenovo, it looks like the C++ stuff itself is basic language stuff, OOP, and boost libs
[01:57:22] <Raziel> as for the financial stuff, it's not exactly my specialty but it seems like relatively basic algorithms whose straightforward implementations wouldn't be anything fancy
[01:58:03] <Raziel> so $1450 seems like quite a lot of money for that :p
[01:58:34] <Lenovo> Raziel: that's what I also though
[01:58:54] <Lenovo> But people in the comment section were really happy with this course
[01:59:09] <Lenovo> That's why I was thinking, maybe I'm wrong
[01:59:37] <Lenovo> But yeah, I think it would be better to find a good practical book about C++ applied to financial engineering
[02:00:18] <Raziel> I mean, it's probably fine? If you have no programming background at all, and need/want the directed and centralized way a course does stuff, instead of looking for lots of different tutorials or books yourself or learning by implementing stuff
[02:00:57] <Lenovo> Raziel: I have programming background, I finished my bsc in CS and I do a msc in Finance
[02:00:58] <Raziel> there's also a certificate at the end apparently, but I have no idea if that has any value whatsoever :p

[22:21:20] <meicceli> given a class Foo, is it possible to add a data member std::unique_ptr<Foo> inside Foo's definition? Like "class Foo {public: std::unique_ptr<Foo> m_child;};"
[22:22:12] <rpav> yes
[22:22:48] <rpav> though you need to be wary of a couple of things especially wrt automatic chained dtors, but it's entirely legal and often useful
[22:23:23] <meicceli> could you elaborate on how? or point to some material on the topic?
[22:25:21] <rpav> {} struct S { unique_ptr<S> s; };
[22:25:21] <geordi>  
[22:27:55] <meicceli> right, i guess my problem is/was declaring" QVector<std::unique_ptr<Foo>> m_children" inside Foo
[22:28:47] <rpav> qt things tend to not be very friendly for incomplete types
[22:30:49] <rpav> you can also do `struct T; struct S { unique_ptr<T> t; };` and it's entirely valid (and very useful), but you need an actual definition for `T` before you can use S, and some code breaks that
[22:31:37] <rpav> also iirc the root of an "impossible to find error" in most compilers, but of course this is #c++ and all compilers are theoretical ;)
