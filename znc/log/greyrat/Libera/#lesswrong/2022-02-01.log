[00:55:30] <zebrask> I am not sure if I should take Adam Rutherford seriously, he seems to be the kind of science popularizer who says stuff in an intriguing "clickbait-y" way that ends up being disappointing when you look into it. I heard him on this Mindscape episode: https://www.preposterousuniverse.com/podcast/2019/05/20/episode-47-adam-rutherford-on-humans-animals-and-life-in-general/
[00:55:32] <Robomot> Episode 47: Adam Rutherford on Humans, Animals, and Life in General ‚Äì Sean Carroll
[00:56:26] <zebrask> At one point he says that "We don‚Äôt see any manifestations of this creative process in any other organism apart from Homo sapiens, with one caveat, which we can talk about in just a minute, and that is weird." ‚Üí referring to people making artistic figures. He never loops back on that and I can't figure out what he's referring to.
[00:57:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: Hah
[00:57:18] <zebrask> He also says "We are obligate tool users, which means we can‚Äôt function without tools, and we now think that around about 1% of animals are obligate tool users, which doesn‚Äôt sound like a lot. It‚Äôs 1 in 100, but that is literally thousands of species. What‚Äôs more interesting than the number, is the range. So lots of mammals do it. We do it. Other primates do it."
[00:58:16] <zebrask> I feel like it's a strong claim to say that 1%  of all species are obligate tool users.
[00:58:39] <gwern> animals
[00:58:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> That sounds blatantly false given how many beetles there are
[00:58:57] <zebrask> Well he sort of equivocates there.
[00:59:25] <zebrask> I think he means 1% of all animal species.
[00:59:57] <Obormot\Arcturus> "The estimated number of animal species on our planet falls somewhere in the vast range of three to 30 million."
[01:00:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> So 1% of that is actually 30 to 300 thousand
[01:00:33] <Obormot\Arcturus> Are 30,000 to 300,000 species of animals obligate tool users?
[01:00:40] <Obormot\Arcturus> Seems obvious the answer is no
[01:01:39] <zebrask> Yeah, hard to know what he meant by that.
[01:01:45] <gwern> I think I would want a definition of 'tool' first. is an ant farming aphids a tool-user? what about termites with their leaf farms? there's a *lot* of ants and termites
[01:01:51] <Betawolf> raw animal numbers would seem more plausible than species, if you have a definition of 'animal' that excludes insects and everything else there's millions of
[01:02:16] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yes the overwhelming majority of those species are insects

[01:03:52] <Obormot\Arcturus> Can't allow that
[01:03:56] <Betawolf> the opposite! We're eating so much that we've created all this wobbly delicious meat-mass.

[01:04:33] <adiabatic> I don't have that much fridge space
[01:04:38] <zebrask> I feel like the claim is pretty dubious by any definition considering that it's unclear if any of the species in this article are obligate tool users: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool_use_by_animals
[01:04:39] <Robomot> Tool use by animals - Wikipedia (Tool use by animals is a phenomenon in which an animal uses any kind of tool in order to achieve a goal such as acquiring food and water, grooming, defense, communication, recreation or construction. Originally thought to be a skill possessed only by humans, some tool use requires a sophisticated level of cognition. There is considerable discussion about the definition of what ‚Ä¶)
[01:05:57] <zebrask> Like maybe some subpopulations need simple tools to do some of their habitual activities, but that's a pretty far cry from humans, who would be hard pressed to do much of anything without tools.
[01:06:09] <Betawolf> I wonder how much of that green mass is deer.
[01:07:37] <gwern> we would die without fire, apparently. you slowly starve and become infertile on a rawfood diet
[01:08:00] <gwern> thus no human population on record has ever sustained itself on only uncooked food
[01:09:34] <zebrask> Plus I think most people think of tools as like... something you fashion. The kinds of tools animals use tend to be like sticks or shells that they find.
[01:09:38] <adiabatic> and if you subsist entirely on steak tartare and raw liver and eggs and such, you risk foodborne ilnesses too much for this to be a proper strategy?
[01:10:43] <zebrask> I don't have high confidence that this example he kept in reserve of an animal doing art is anything special.
[01:10:46] <gwern> adiabatic: yeah, not to mention, where are you getting all that meat and eggs in the first place?
[01:11:16] <Betawolf> everything's a tool if you tool-use hard enough
[01:11:24] <gwern> you're a modern person? the rest of civilization is eating cooked food like grains. you're a hunter-gatherer? you don't have domesticated chickens in the first place
[01:11:35] <zebrask> You might also be hard-pressed to make steak tartare without tools.

[02:45:39] <Obormot\Arcturus> ... so I had an idea: why don't I test the *filling* separately, by treating it as a custard and baking it, sans crust, in ramekins?
[02:45:57] *** Quits: gbear605_ (~gbear605@user/gbear605) (Ping timeout: 250 seconds)
[02:46:02] <feep> at which point does it stop being a camera and start being a telescope lol
[02:46:32] <feep> that was a 200km+ distance shot.
[02:47:04] <Obormot\Arcturus> I have now done this. I report that the filling is good! But too sweet. I think that the 4 oz brown sugar is excessive; I'd cut it in half, at least. Otherwise I approve. Next time I will make this as a pie. But for now, these custards are tasty enough on their own
[02:47:24] <feep> nice
[02:48:13] <feep> good entry burn..
[02:49:16] <Obormot\Arcturus> Hm, I made my way through a whole ramekin of this and I'm no longer sure I will keep the rest of these. It really is far, far too sweet.
[02:49:30] <Obormot\Arcturus> Probably that brown sugar should be wholly omitted.
[02:49:42] <feep> good landing! little bit of a bounce, but touchdown :D
[02:50:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> adiabatic Ralith: ^ possibly relevant to your interests
[02:50:30] <feep> and s2 burn complete.
[02:51:11] <feep> okay, not gonna wait out the 45m to that second burn
[02:51:46] <kuudes> I take they have had little use to falcon heavy?
[02:52:02] <feep> yeah, f9 kinda cannibalized its market with engine upgrades
[02:52:12] <feep> it's mostly fairing size limited now
[02:56:15] <kuudes> could they catch second stages to some parking orbit and later bring them back on earth with spaceship or something?

[02:56:59] <feep> once you have starship, you really have no need for them
[02:57:05] <kuudes> for the same reason as recycling first stages
[02:57:26] <feep> once you can recover them, there's no economic benefit in recovering them by definition
[02:57:39] <kuudes> well could you recover them without starship?
[02:57:43] <feep> no
[02:57:45] *** sh|tmp is now known as sh
[02:57:48] <feep> they would if they could
[02:57:50] <kuudes> with heavy or something
[02:58:01] <feep> heavy is just a f9 with boosters
[02:58:07] <kuudes> yes
[02:58:29] <feep> so what is your "or something" here, cause s2 still can't reenter
[02:58:36] <feep> it doesn't get more able to reenter if you launch it harder
[02:58:55] <feep> which is all fh does
[02:58:56] <kuudes> you could put a payload that collects the objects and reenters with them?
[02:59:19] <feep> that payload would necessarily be larger than the fairing
[02:59:32] <kuudes> couldn't it be an origami?
[02:59:40] <feep> origami heat tiles?
[02:59:51] <kuudes> maybe?
[02:59:51] <feep> like, at some point it becomes cheaper to develop starship.

[03:00:29] <feep> and starlink is launch limited as much as anything, adding a whole second launch on every launch does not help
[03:00:32] <kuudes> or make s2 so that you can make it smaller now that it has no fuel
[03:00:41] <kuudes> and then go there with dragon and fold it into cargo hold
[03:00:45] * Filipepe greets the present, with an emphasis on feep and kuudes
[03:00:49] <kuudes> hi Filipepe
[03:00:49] <feep> you super cannot fold rockets
[03:01:17] <kuudes> cut the sides open?
[03:01:19] <feep> like, you'd need to completely redesign s2 for this from the ground up
[03:01:32] <feep> that defeats the point of recovering it
[03:01:46] <feep> again, you run into the issue of
[03:01:52] <feep> "instead all that, make starship"
[03:02:00] <kuudes> :-/
[03:02:05] <feep> fh was already a mistake
[03:02:30] <feep> but like, starship *is* "a s2 that can reenter".
[03:02:46] <feep> conceptually if not technically
[03:05:05] <feep> I think the key stone is that spacex is engineer time limited as much as anything
[03:05:49] <feep> anything done on s2 recovery, Very Large Parachute, front deployable heatshield, whatever, takes away from Next Big Rocket development, which is important for future launch capability.
[03:06:05] <feep> why would they develop a tech that does what NBR does but worse
[03:07:42] <feep> anyway, heading back to bed~

[04:36:23] <Obormot\Arcturus> Not cinnamon (allergy) but I put in some allspice
[04:36:25] <Obormot\Arcturus> The other stuff yes

[04:37:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> I don't have any mace :\ Does it come in a convenient powdered form or do I have to grate it or w/e
[04:38:46] <Ralith> mace is dried soft plant matter, so you'd grind or pulverize it

[04:47:02] <Ralith> I am not aware of your technique
[04:48:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> What I do is, I take a squash, halve it lengthwise, scoop out seeds and stuff, remove skin with vegetable peeler, remove ends (so that all that's left is 100% flesh). Then I slather it in olive oil, coating completely on all exposed surfaces. Put both halves flat sides down on a foil-lined cookie sheet. Cover each half with another sheet of foil, wrapping it snug, so each half is fully covered and no part exposed.
[04:48:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> Then, 1 hour in 400¬∞F preheated oven.
[04:48:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> Remove, let cool, use immersion blender to puree with like half a tsp salt, put in mason jar
[04:49:01] <Obormot\Arcturus> Works great, better than the canned stuff for sure

[08:49:36] <quanticle> A taste:
[08:49:39] <quanticle> "Lawful evil is a by-the-book Nazi in his snappy uniform; Chaotic evil is the Joker from Batman; Neutral evil ‚Äî uh ‚Äî Hm. What in Hades is neutral evil? By the description, a neutral evil man harms and oppresses and kills others but has a normal respect for authority, without feeling compelled to obey or defy it, and he can be tempted into lying and deception when it suits him. So he kills
[08:49:41] <quanticle> and harms but does not lie. Hm. Logically, this character can only exist if and when he is under a lawful authority who tells him to harm and oppress and kill, and he generally obeys, but not when inconvenient. I am not sure who this could be, aside from a lax flunky to a Dark Lord, or a Commie soldier showing up drunk on parade, and grifting from the quartermaster, but gleefully grinding the
[08:49:43] <quanticle> faces of the proles on demand."
[08:50:07] <quanticle> I dunno, that seems pretty reasonable to me.
[08:51:06] <quanticle> Like, there are lots of evil dictatorships that would be 100x as evil as they are in real life if it weren't for the fact that the low-level bureaucrats, policemen and military officers are all corrupt as all get out and can be bribed into doing or acquiring pretty much whatever you want.
[08:52:45] <adiabatic> "but does not lie" sounds wrong
[08:52:53] <adiabatic> if you're evil, why wouldn't you lie?
[08:53:27] <quanticle> Like, to me, lawful evil = receives order to cause harm, and ruthlessly carries it out without question. Chaotic evil = causes harm on their own even without requiring orders. Neutral evil = recieves order to cause harm, but asks for a bribe before carrying it out
[08:54:42] <quanticle> "I have this order that says I'm supposed to throw you into a concentration camp... but, if you make it my while, I'll tell the Commander the house was empty"
[08:55:17] <quanticle> I suppose it would be more evil if they took the bribe and then told the Commander anyway
[08:59:55] <adiabatic> you're not obligated to be maximally evil

[09:06:42] <Obormot\Arcturus> If not, the whole thing is worthless
[09:06:48] <saturn2> lawful evil does evil by working within the system, chaotic evil does evil by confronting the system, neutral evil goes along with the system and does evil as a side project?

[09:16:11] <PlanckWalk> So more like neutral evil: organization vs individual is irrelevant, only power matters?
[09:17:39] <Obormot\Arcturus> In the two-axis alignment system, law vs. chaos is whether your sense of right and wrong, and your behavior, is oriented toward the individual or toward society
[09:18:08] <Obormot\Arcturus> Good vs. evil is the relative weight you place on causes outside yourself vs. yourself
[09:18:34] <Obormot\Arcturus> The important thing to realize is that, by construction, most ordinary people are neutral
[09:19:16] <PlanckWalk> Yeah, I'd go with that.  To the extent that society matters, it's more an instrumental concern than a terminal one.
[09:19:31] <Obormot\Arcturus> Most people have both individualistic and collectivistic tendencies, and thus are neutral on the Law/Chaos axis
[09:19:52] <Obormot\Arcturus> Likewise, most people have both altruistic and selfish tendencies, and thus are neutral on the Good/Evil axis
[09:20:37] <PlanckWalk> But then terminal vs instrumental isn't Gygaxian
[09:21:04] <Obormot\Arcturus> Neutral Evil thus means that you have little to no regard for anything/anyone outside yourself as a terminal value (Evil on the Good/Evil axis), but you are neither especially individualistic nor especially collectivist
[09:22:14] <quanticle> Obormot\Arcturus: Yes?
[09:22:21] <quanticle> It quotes the D&D manual
[09:22:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> quanticle: The 3rd Edition, note
[09:23:18] <saturn2> how can you be collectivist while having no regard for anyone outside yourself?
[09:23:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> And, on the other axis, Neutral Evil means that you do not have any particular problem with operating in a hierarchy, taking orders, being part of society in general (where a Chaotic Evil person would find these things repellent), nor do you have any unusually strong desire for structure, affinity for power within hierarchies, etc. (as a Lawful Evil person would)
[09:24:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: Treating other people as instrumental cogs within the machine of society, but understanding and experiencing power and ambition as exclusively or almost exclusively situated in social hierarchies
[09:25:19] <saturn2> i see
[09:26:03] <PlanckWalk> Lawful Evil - become emperor of the world, Chaotic Evil - become powerful enough to not have to care about the rest of the world?
[09:26:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> That's one example, sure
[09:27:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> Anyway, re: Neutral Evil, again remember that most people are neutral by construction, and this applies within each axis also: most evil people are going to be Neutral Evil
[09:28:02] <Obormot\Arcturus> Your average criminal, of almost any sort, is Neutral Evil

[10:34:19] <quanticle> Much longer
[10:34:34] <quanticle> Probably more entertaining, but definitely also more in need of an editor.
[10:34:34] <PlanckWalk> Worm didn't piss me off nearly as much.
[10:35:06] <quanticle> Comparing Worm to any _single_ book is a mistake. The point of comparison should be book series.
[10:35:11] <PlanckWalk> True
[10:35:20] <PlanckWalk> Compare to ... sayyyy Wheel of Time?
[10:35:31] <quanticle> Comparing Worm to Atlas Shrugged is a category error; the correct comparison is to something like Wheel of Time.
[10:35:34] <quanticle> Yes.
[10:35:39] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yeah I got a few chapters into Worm and I was like
[10:35:52] <Obormot\Arcturus> "This needs an editor who's not afraid to cut out entire sections or even chapters"
[10:36:01] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Otherwise it's a waste of time"
[10:36:01] <adiabatic> well, AS is probably the biggest physical book I've ever read
[10:36:04] <Obormot\Arcturus> And I stopped reading
[10:36:13] <adiabatic> at least I know how big it is
[10:36:15] <PlanckWalk> Worm was worse than the early book or two of Wheel of Time, but very much better than the rest.
[10:36:22] <adiabatic> with some random long fic on the internet, who knows
[10:36:29] <quanticle> Forget chapters, Wildbow himself admits that, if he had to re-edit Worm he'd cut out entire story arcs.
[10:36:33] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yeah
[10:36:34] <Obormot\Arcturus> Exactly
[10:37:14] <quanticle> Like, the Travelers arc, for example. Just dump it. Hive it off into a side-novel or novella if you like it too much to delete.
[10:37:25] <quanticle> But don't have it in the main storyline.
[10:38:11] <nshepperd2> yeah i got a few chapters in and got bored
[10:38:51] <PlanckWalk> But forget Worm, what about Wandering Inn? ;-)
[10:39:29] <PlanckWalk> Has it hit 10 million words yet?
[10:41:42] <PlanckWalk> Apparently only 9 million.  Sad.
[10:42:17] <adiabatic> damn, I'm still impressed
[10:42:20] <adiabatic> that's a lot of words
[10:42:30] <adiabatic> sure, too many words
[10:42:51] <adiabatic> but I don't think I have that many words in me even if I were to take LSD
[10:43:14] <adiabatic> and I do _not_ have the finest words
[10:43:19] <quanticle> It brings to mind what my brother said, when he was three years old and seeing Niagara Falls for the first time: "Too much water, let's go home"
[10:44:02] <Obormot\Arcturus> lol

[12:02:27] <quanticle> Wait... you actually look at the visualizer?
[12:02:40] <quanticle> Oh, he's not here any more.
[12:03:39] * quanticle always turned off the visualization (unless he was trying to diagnose why something sounded weird, in which case I'd turn on the equalizer graph visualization)
[12:04:34] <quanticle> But I haven't had to do that in a long time. It turns out that you don't need to mess with equalizer settings nearly as much when your headphones & speakers aren't total bargain-basement junk.

[12:19:07] <synthmeat> so, my self-diagnosed atypical astigmatism in the right eye is going away, after no doctor even found and issue, and doctors literally giggling at me when i proposed that it might be because i sleep distinctly on one side and i could get it fixed by, well, sleeping symmetrically
[12:19:23] <Obormot\Arcturus> And is that how you are fixing it?
[12:19:31] <synthmeat> yes
[12:19:38] <Obormot\Arcturus> Nice
[12:19:56] <synthmeat> i'm marking deviation (an arc from a point led) at arms length continuously, and it's shortening
[12:20:13] <synthmeat> "maybe you should eat more fish and dark greens" fuck you
[12:21:21] <PapuaHardyNet> synthmeat: how does that work? how do you get astigmatism by sleeping on one side? is that because of pressure on your eyeball?
[12:21:31] <synthmeat> yes, that's my theory
[12:22:01] <synthmeat> i really dig that side into pillow, frequently even on my arm/hand
[12:22:33] <PapuaHardyNet> I do that too. Perhaps I should sleep like a vampire from now on. Or perhaps my pillow is soft enough
[12:23:11] <synthmeat> if you have no sleep issues with apnea or similar by sleeping on yer back, definitely sleep like a vampire
[12:24:13] <synthmeat> i started sleeping on that side extensively mostly because of gallstones, it helps a lot
[12:25:00] <synthmeat> on that tangent, how the hell are we not able to just - remove the stones and not cut the entire thing out

[12:43:52] <PlanckWalk> Apparently by the time you get any symptoms from gallstones, the whole gall bladder is diseased from repeated inflammation and won't ever work right again.
[12:44:48] <PlanckWalk> Just removing the stones won't do anything useful since they'll just come back worse and worse.
[12:45:19] <PlanckWalk> It would be nice if there was a way to prevent that, though.
[12:50:33] <synthmeat> i'm pretty sure i got them by losing a lot of weight suddenly, multiple times

[21:35:59] *** Quits: gproto23 (~gproto23@user/gproto23) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[21:36:20] <pompolic> and/or belief as attire
[21:36:27] <zebrask> Like, "You should believe all the CDC's recommendations because they know better?"
[21:36:42] <pompolic> for example
[21:38:07] <pompolic> or things like (implicitly) "because the authorities are lying about vaccines, you should propagate that belief to vaccine efficacy"
[21:38:38] <pompolic> broadly, perhaps, deriving beliefs about the territory from other people's maps
[21:38:39] <zebrask> I mean, the concept of having trouble even having a discussion with normies because they don't grok the idea of establishing an epistemological framework for the discussion resonates, but I always see it more as them flailing around in concept-space, not necessarily carving out a little enclave and trying to lure me into it.
[21:38:48] <pompolic> from beliefs about other people's maps*
[21:39:05] <pompolic> it is possible i am needlessly paranoid
[21:39:49] <pompolic> thing is, i encountered people who actually did that, and it kind of fucked me up for a long time, so my mind kind of just goes there
[21:40:29] <pompolic> most people are probably winging it but also probably are puppeted by memeplexes/culture
[21:40:44] <pompolic> so it's kind of like the egregore speaking through them has a quarrel with me
[21:40:44] <zebrask> I suppose it is often true that because they don't seem to be able to do things like isolate a chain of reasoning and agree on it independent of the larger disagreement, I am forced to discuss things at their level.
[21:42:08] <pompolic> i think you could theoretically double crux but a) that requires cooperation/good faith (which, again, i often feel like isn't there, but i could be wrong)
[21:42:11] <zebrask> That's usually an expedient that I only do when their own reasoning has internal contradictions of easy-to-spot absurdities in various edge cases. I can temporarily accept their epistemology for the purposes of showing that their thinking is muddled in some way.
[21:42:17] <pompolic> b) forcing it would be rude
[21:42:59] <pompolic> yeah
[21:43:11] <pompolic> i don't actually care about convincing other people, just minimizing their impact on me
[21:43:38] <pompolic> this is because i don't feel like i *can* convince them if they don't want to be convinced
[21:43:47] <pompolic> and it would be rude/vaguely bad to do so
[21:44:27] <pompolic> _however_ every corner in which their beliefs differ from the territory is an arbitrage opportunity
[21:44:34] <pompolic> from this you get uhh opposed bets i guess
[21:47:05] *** Joins: galambo__ (~galambo@user/galambo)
[21:47:48] <pompolic> but also i expect that this, fully deployed, would essentially mangle the other person's entire belief structure and they would be left with having to pick up the pieces while teetering on the edge of a psychotic break
[21:48:22] <pompolic> this is probably like the spooky powers attributed to Vassar

[23:45:52] <Obormot\Arcturus>  Valenti experienced were gone from NYC!
[23:45:56] <Robomot> Lessons of a ‚ÄòSex Object‚Äô ‚Äì The Patriarch Tree ‚Äì Medium (Her freshman year at Tulane University, Jessica Valenti made the mistake of sleeping with her ex-boyfriend‚Äôs roommate. When the ex-boyfriend (‚ÄúKyle‚Äù in her memoir Sex Object) found out about this, he‚Ä¶)
[23:46:42] <Obormot\Arcturus> The experience she describes was the tail end of the Dinkins era. By the end of Giuliani's first term, all of these things were gone
[23:47:10] <Obormot\Arcturus> So... it turns out that you can fix misogyny by doing quality-of-life policing??
[23:48:09] <Obormot\Arcturus> "I lived in a house where once or twice a week my mom would go outside wearing yellow rubber gloves to clean up the used condoms that littered the sidewalk from the men who parked there with prostitutes." (from the book) ... by late 90s this was no longer a thing
[23:48:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> "The working-class neighborhood where Jessica Valenti grew up was frequented by hookers and their customers" ... ditto
[23:48:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> "when she traveled to school via the subway, she encountered the notorious ‚Äúflashers‚Äù and ‚Äúmashers‚Äù (exhibitionists and frotteurs) who have menaced the city‚Äôs public-transportation system for decades" ... ditto
[23:49:09] <Obormot\Arcturus> Menaced the city's public-transportation system for decades, then mysteriously evaporated forever! Amazing
[23:49:41] <kuudes> Obormot\Arcturus, "you can fix misogyny by doing quality-of-life policing" this sounds good
[23:49:49] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Ms. Valenti doesn‚Äôt seem to understand this as a uniquely urban hazard, unknown to the many millions of Americans smart enough to avoid big cities" ... but also unknown to all New Yorkers from like 1996 onwards

[23:51:21] <kuudes> :+1:

[23:52:20] <Obormot\Arcturus> He extended it! But only by 1 term
[23:52:23] <Obormot\Arcturus> Didn't manage any more
[23:52:33] <Obormot\Arcturus> He did a solid 12 years and it was great
[23:55:09] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Many genuinely despicable behaviors are commonplace in big cities, including violent crime, drug abuse and sexual hedonism" ... did you know that I have never been mugged, assaulted, or even *pickpocketed*, in almost 30 years of living here
[23:55:26] <adiabatic> sounds like you picked the right 30 years
[23:55:33] <Obormot\Arcturus> My mother had her purse snatched once. My grandmother, also same, also once.
[23:55:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> That was the extent of "violent crime in the big city!!!" that my family has experienced
[23:56:02] <Obormot\Arcturus> I dunno, guys, that seems like a pretty good rate to me
[23:56:03] <saturn2> but did mayor bloomberg make scott aaronson want to kill himself? i think not
[23:56:46] <adiabatic> I thought the only Aaronson ______ himself meme was "castrate himself"
[23:57:29] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Of course the violent crime happens. I'm not making some crazy claim that there's no crime in NYC. But, you know, it's a big city. And crime rate maps exist...)
[23:58:09] <pompolic> >Ms. Valenti
[23:58:13] <pompolic> ah, i recognize that name
[23:58:19] * Obormot\Arcturus is once again reminded of how the rationalists decided to rent a group house in one of the most high-crime parts of Brooklyn, then proceeded to get assaulted and raped multiple times over a period of several years
