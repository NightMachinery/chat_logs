[13:15:23] <evolv> how is an op gonna help you
[13:16:08] <Lumine> Morning evolv
[13:16:21] <evolv> g'morning, Lumine
[13:16:26] <evolv> how're you doing?
[13:16:35] <Lumine> Having coffee and going to work later
[13:16:47] <Lumine> (at home)
[13:17:01] <arryana> why don't you just get a better client?
[13:17:02] <evolv> I'm drinking tea and working right now
[13:17:04] * arryana giggles
[13:17:17] <Lumine> Sounds good
[13:17:34] <evolv> would be better if I liked my job
[13:17:40] <Lumine> :/
[13:17:55] <Lumine> I just gave a long Ted talk in another IRC
[13:17:58] <Lumine> channel*
[13:18:01] <Delf> evolv: By answering a few simple questions so I can determine whether or not I should make a request
[13:18:06] <evolv> what wsa the topic, Lumine?
[13:18:27] <evolv> Delf, I don't think the DJ wants any more requests for the chicken dance
[13:18:39] <Delf> Chicken dance?
[13:18:54] <evolv> if you don't know, you are a fortunate person, Delf
[13:19:06] <Lumine> evolv: conscious attention and the problem of information and how we rely on linear input and that it has led to the problem of information explosion, and the only solution to it has been to build more powerful computers
[13:19:07] <Delf> I most likely am but I don't see the relevance
[13:20:28] <Delf> arryana: Did you just make a joke?
[13:21:01] <evolv> Lumine, I'd say the source of the problem is the desire for information
[13:21:17] <Delf> Desire is the source of all problem, no?
[13:21:58] <Lumine> evolv: while that may be the source for the problem, there is no solution that I can see
[13:22:27] <Delf> The solution would require a desire for solution and that in itself is also causing problem
[13:22:29] <evolv> Lumine, maybe not as a social or political movement, no
[13:23:00] <inhahe_> People are just frustrated with desire because their desires are so hard to fulfill in this world. And, because they not only have desires, they form attachments to the objects of their desire. Desire can be purer than that. And, I think, annihilating desire to cease suffering is curing the disease by killing the patient.
[13:23:32] <Delf> Couldn't have said it better myself
[13:24:24] <evolv> inhahe_, what's a desire that can be considered "pure"
[13:24:49] <inhahe_> An expression of love, for example.
[13:25:00] <inhahe_> The desire to express one's love in a certain way at a certain tie
[13:25:02] <inhahe_> time
[13:25:06] <Lumine> inhale_ what about the desire to be free
[13:25:08] <evolv> can you narrow that down
[13:25:18] <evolv> "love" is a broad term
[13:25:37] <inhahe_> lumine: yes i think so
[13:26:25] <Lumine> But I agree with you, if you cut out desire from the picture, you're left with no functioning organism. The desire to be alive is still desire.
[13:26:48] <inhahe_> evolv hmm maybe the desire to compliment someone, or show them affection, or give them something else that would do them well at that moment
[13:27:21] <inhahe_>  but, when i said desire is purer than that, i'm not sure i meant a subset of the things you might desire, but rather any desire where you're not attached to a particular outcome.
[13:27:39] *** Joins: Keter (~Keter@user/keter)
[13:27:40] <inhahe_> although incidentally i do think some desires are purer than others in another sense
[13:28:06] <Delf> The desire to not have a desire is also a desire
[13:28:50] <krb> desire to procreate
[13:29:05] <evolv> I think the most important thing is to learn how to be at peace in solitude
[13:29:25] <evolv> no external stimuli
[13:29:28] <inhahe_> i think it's natural to need communion, we're fundamentally social beings
[13:29:35] <Delf> Why is that the most important thing?
[13:29:57] <evolv> Delf, because no matter what happens, no matter where you are, you can be at peace
[13:30:29] <inhahe_> being at peace in solitude won't prepare you for pain
[13:30:32] <evolv> and it's not an easy thing to do because we practice escapism into our stuff
[13:30:45] <Lumine> Because peace of mind is what everyone ultimately wants. Nobody wants to be anxious. At least I can say that with confidence about myself. Not that I'm at peace all the time, mind you.
[13:30:48] <evolv> shows, movies, books, computers, various hobbies
[13:30:58] <evolv> we never really learn how to enjoy stillness
[13:31:11] <Delf> Being at peace is not a precursor to greatness. The desire to reach that peace itself can pacify you enough to render you totally useless, to yourself and others
[13:31:16] <arryana> what do you think you need an op for. delf?
[13:31:43] <evolv> if you can't be at peace in solitude, is there ever peace outside of it?
[13:31:44] <arryana> haha, speak for yourself, evolv, some of us do just fine with stillness
[13:32:05] * arryana has spent upward of four months with no human contact, apart from reporting one single fire
[13:32:07] <Delf> arryana: I needs to find out if ban list is being imported from other channels, if there can be exceptions and also... why the fuck. Thanks for asking :)
[13:32:53] <arryana> if there is an imported ban list, which i doubt, it would be a trusted channel the ops were also members of and think are valid bans.
[13:33:34] <Delf> Fucking hell... that's problems crossing over through the medium of trust
[13:33:56] <arryana> i said 'if' and that i doubt there is.  also that they'd be members if there were
[13:34:02] <arryana> i don't see a trust issue
[13:34:15] <Delf> Trust is not the issue. Unstable people are
[13:34:25] <arryana> hahah
[13:34:36] <krb> there isnt many people left on irc
[13:34:43] <Delf> Don't piss me off! You know I'm emotionally unstable...! :P
[13:34:45] <arryana> i doubt it's an issue enough to merit all that much being fussed about
[13:34:53] <Lumine> It's true, we're like endangered animals on IRC
[13:34:54] <arryana> you're pissing yourself off, and don't tell me what to do.
[13:35:00] <arryana> i'm not a hostage to your emotional instability
[13:35:13] <arryana> you can /ignore me if you find what i say to be getting your knickers knotted
[13:35:24] <Delf> Actually, it is very much of an issue because there is this guy who seems to be on an imported ban list that should not be on anyone's ban list, except for religious zealots
[13:35:26] <arryana> nothing i'm saying is even the slightest bit unreasonable
[13:35:46] <Delf> Damn right!
[13:35:52] <arryana> i'm sure he's free to approach any op if he feels it's unfair.
[13:35:52] <Delf> That too pisses me off
[13:36:22] <Delf> I will never hold you responsible for my emotions
[13:36:25] * arryana shrugs
[13:36:33] <arryana> it's your problem if you do, not mine.
[13:37:22] <Delf> Anyway, this guy is honorable he has been banned because something he said was interpreted in the worst of ways
[13:37:40] <Delf> We must stick up for him
[13:37:46] <arryana> as i said, i'm sure if that's the case he can approach an op in message and have it dealt with
[13:37:48] <evolv> what's his nick, Delf
[13:37:57] <Delf> His nick is duncecotus
[13:38:11] <arryana> oh lord, he's been banned more than once.
[13:38:12] <evolv> that sounds familiar and someone who has been annoying
[13:38:13] <arryana> and he earned it.

[13:38:51] <pussipupu> Yeah that was a bespoke ban, not mass produced
[13:38:53] <dispersed> I want to know too
[13:38:53] <arryana> but the ban is valid
[13:39:25] <Delf> Hmm... to me, it does matter a lot! Because I did not notice any malicious behavior from what I seen
[13:39:28] <Jong> arryana during the months you spent without human contact, has your mind drifted to a certain memory often? Or a certain period of your life often?
[13:39:45] <Delf> This means I suck shit at determining or that I totally missed it
[13:39:46] <pussipupu> You can see the ban list with "/mode ##philosophy +b" incidentally
[13:39:48] <arryana> the first two weeks were almost nothing but that, jong.
[13:39:56] <Jong> arryana then what happened?
[13:39:59] <arryana> then i got over myself and shut off that internal dialogue
[13:40:17] <arryana> and i realized almost immediately how much more information about the world flows in when you're listening instead of thinking
[13:40:27] <arryana> i never went back, mentally
[13:40:40] <Delf> I'm jealous of you, arryana. I could never be alone... with all the personalities. I struggle understanding the pain of people being alone
[13:41:05] <evolv> being alone is a breeze
[13:41:18] <arryana> of course you could.  people tell themselves 'i could never' to justify not trying.
[13:41:22] <evolv> managing to support yourself being alone is another
[13:41:31] <arryana> haha
[13:41:45] <Delf> What? You do realize I am harboring more than one personality, yes?
[13:41:50] <arryana> that summer i lived mostly on fish, squirrels, huckleberries, and juniper sprig tea
[13:42:13] <Delf> Living off squirrels!? Those are toooo damn cute to eat
[13:42:26] <arryana> not if you're hungry enough. then they're food.
[13:42:36] <evolv> the bills elsewhere have to be paid
[13:42:38] <Delf> Fucking hell, I'd eat trees and their roots
[13:42:43] <Jong> arryana If you could divide your thoughts into thoughts about people, thoughts about events, and thoughts about ideas (math, science, physics, philosophy, AI, calculus, a painting, a song, a cooking recipe, etc), what were the proportions after two weeks?
[13:42:58] <arryana> not for me, i lived in my truck and camper.  all i needed was insurance money and enough gas to get to the next place.
[13:43:17] <arryana> after the first two weeks?
[13:43:28] <arryana> music would by far be the biggest thing still going through my mind.
[13:43:32] <arryana> but mostly, i just listen.
[13:43:53] <arryana> it even shows up on an eeg.  it looks like i'm sleeping until i'm asked a question
[13:44:06] <evolv> I don't think I'd think about any of those listed things for two weeks
[13:44:21] <Delf> pussipupu: I see items on the "Ban List". I'm probably doing it wrong
[13:44:26] <Delf> Three
[13:44:43] <arryana> i think about people when something brings them to mind.  a thing i wish they could see, a thing that reminds me of something we experienced together.
[13:44:52] <arryana> a thought i'd like their perspective on
[13:45:05] <arryana> mathematical thoughts pretty much never occur to me, as i have dyscalculia
[13:45:17] <Jong> arryana woah. So your mind was literally operating language-less ?
[13:45:44] <arryana> still is, most of the time
[13:46:12] <arryana> if i'm answering a question, i'm thinking.  if i have a problem to solve, i'm thinking.  most of the rest of the time i'm just listening.
[13:46:42] <evolv> I think almost entirely visually. If I think verbally, I have to visualize talking to someone in person
[13:46:45] <arryana> listening requires too much attention in a very different way than thinking.
[13:46:46] <Jong> I always thought it was dangerous to shut off language in the mind for that long.
[13:46:51] * arryana shrugs
[13:47:04] <Delf> evolv: Visually?
[13:47:07] <arryana> i spilled my metaphorical froot-loops the first two weeks, absolutely.
[13:47:15] <arryana> then i found some balance.
[13:47:15] <evolv> Delf, like scenes from a film
[13:47:21] <evolv> Delf, or abstractions
[13:47:30] <arryana> all that was thirty years ago, though
[13:47:39] <arryana> it got way easier to live with after the first two years.
[13:48:05] <arryana> learning to hike was a great insulation for that, too
[13:48:23] <arryana> and by that i mean, real long distance hiking, carrying your own stuff
[13:48:31] <Delf> That is indeed very interesting. Where is the significance of the details in those thought, evolv?
[13:48:43] <evolv> Delf, what do you mean?
[13:49:07] <Delf> The scenes, are they crisp clear? Filled with many important details, the environment, setting and the whole scene?
[13:49:40] <evolv> just enough to function as required
[13:50:25] <Jong> arryana I've been alone in my apartment for about 2 weeks now.  Bad childhood have kept surfacing, even though paying attention to them does nothing productive for me now.   I can see that evolution would have it that negative memories mean something threatened survival, and to forget about a threat means one is more likely to die.  Maybe that's what makes these memories so hard to forget
[13:50:31] <Delf> And that would be? A scene with enough relevant details in respect to the abstractions?
[13:50:35] <arryana> you're not alone, you're online.
[13:50:50] <arryana> when i say i was alone, i mean i had no phone, no electricity, no running water, no people.
[13:50:59] <arryana> i had a handful of books, but i had read them all many times.
[13:51:04] <Jong> wow, you went off the grid
[13:51:30] <Jong> Has the experience totally changed you?
[13:51:33] <Delf> I fucking knew it. arryana is a super soldier
[13:51:39] <arryana> my only human contact was the local forest service radio, which had weather and whatever important updates in the morning, and a sign off at night
[13:51:47] <arryana> which amounted to something like three minutes of total speech.
[13:51:48] <Jong> Are you happier? See new meaning in life?
[13:51:52] <arryana> i only used the radio once, myself.
[13:51:53] <evolv> Delf, if the function is to think out some form of thought useful in a social situation, I envision a Starbucks I used to go to in my early to mid 20s sitting outside having a one sided conversation with someone sitting opposite of me at a table
[13:51:55] <arryana> oh hell yes.
[13:52:11] <arryana> and as to bad childhood stuff...
[13:52:16] <evolv> I envision it in third person, I see the side of the building, tables, chairs, some bushes and trees
[13:52:33] <arryana> it was during that time that i realized what your parents do to you until you're 18 is on them.  what you do to yourself after that is on you.
[13:52:50] <arryana> hell yes to it changing me, and hell yes to being happier.
[13:53:08] <Jong> Way to go! That sounds awesome
[13:53:27] <arryana> looking back on childhood shit is like sticking your tongue in a painful tooth cavity
[13:53:34] <arryana> as long as you keep poking that crap it'll never heal
[13:53:38] <Delf> evolv: And then?
[13:53:52] <evolv> Delf, this it's just about the one-sided conversation
[13:53:53] <arryana> the more you make your life about it, the more of your life it takes up.
[13:54:25] <Jong> arryana I actually read online that it's good to write it all down. I think the idea is to write it down and forget, not write it down and reread it every day lol
[13:54:33] * arryana shrugs
[13:54:43] <arryana> if that's what it takes to put it down and walk away from it, sure
[13:54:47] <Delf> evolv: I got lost there @ the last sentence
[13:55:32] <arryana> i don't understand getting stuck on what we were or what happened to us.  it's like still being traumatized over having to be toilet trained.
[13:55:48] <arryana> nobody's life is pleasant and comfortable.  the things that suck often teach us the most.

[13:56:19] <Delf> evolv: Now I'm following
[13:56:41] <evolv> there are times when another person does speak, usually asking questions. That functions usually to question those thoughts or to help organize said thoughts
[13:56:52] <Jong> One line of reasoning that's given me some peace is the idea that evolution necessarily entails evolving from stupidity to intelligence. So all the stupidity I had to deal with was just me being caught in the crossfires of evolution at work.

[14:03:36] <arryana> i got a box from etsy, but i didn't order anything
[14:04:50] <evolv> there's a monastery about 3.5 hours away I want to go to. New people who want to stay there can stay up to two weeks. I keep entertaining the idea
[14:05:05] <evolv> I have to build up my vacation hours
[14:05:27] <Lumine> I almost went to a monastery two years ago
[14:05:29] <evolv> at least 4 weeks else my wife will get mad
[14:05:30] <arryana> i've done a ten day vipassana retreat
[14:05:31] <Lumine> A local one
[14:05:47] <arryana> the one in kaufman texas, id you're curious to look it up for who they are and what it's like
[14:05:48] <Delf> What is the purpose of those?
[14:05:52] <Lumine> I was considering a retreat seriously
[14:06:04] <evolv> I'd rather not do those vipassana ones
[14:06:05] * arryana is deeply touched at the package
[14:06:20] <arryana> they're also no speech, no eye contact, no exercise
[14:06:26] <arryana> no phones, no radios, no journals
[14:06:37] <evolv> the monastery requires physical labor to some degree
[14:06:45] <evolv> help in the kitchen, outside work, etc.
[14:06:53] <evolv> in addition to meditation and such
[14:06:54] <arryana> yeah, this is not that
[14:07:03] <arryana> though people are welcome to volunteer when they're not taking the course
[14:07:21] * arryana discovers a childhood favorite object in the box
[14:07:37] <evolv> yeah, this is more like living like a samana, I believe
[14:08:12] <Lumine> Since then I've learned that if I was going to find what I was looking for, I wouldn't find it in a monastery, instead my own mind would be the key.
[14:08:26] <Lumine> If at all
[14:08:57] <evolv> vipassana retreats are kind of like brute force meditation retreats
[14:09:08] <arryana> it's to learn by deep immersion
[14:09:11] <arryana> thrown in the deep end, as it were
[14:09:27] <arryana> but all it taught me is that i'm not a buddhist.
[14:09:38] <evolv> it's not Buddhist, though
[14:09:41] <arryana> most of the best things in my life stem from attachment.
[14:09:50] <evolv> it's not anti-Buddhist or anything
[14:10:07] <Delf> That's if you're doing it right, attachment to great things
[14:10:11] <evolv> it's just the SN Goenka method laid out for lay people
[14:10:19] <arryana> it's mostly the idea that physical discomfort/pain does not need to be hooked to emotional pain.
[14:10:25] <amigojapan> Hey evolv
[14:10:26] <arryana> and i learned that lesson a long, long time ago.
[14:10:30] <evolv> hi, amigojapan!
[14:10:51] <arryana> they lost me for good with one story.
[14:11:15] <arryana> i think it was the fifth day
[14:11:26] <Delf> What was the story?
[14:12:05] <arryana> it was about a mother whose six year old drowned.  they went on to say that it was her attachment to that child that should be eradicated, that she should love all people as deeply as she loved that child, and then the loss would not have caused her pain.
[14:12:08] <arryana> fuck that action.
[14:12:24] <evolv> that's not Buddhist lol
[14:12:53] <arryana> there are a lot of buddhist premises i don't agree with.
[14:13:02] <arryana> not that other people aren't welcome to them, but it's not my road and never will be.
[14:13:53] <arryana> take the monks who live to chant, and don't walk across a courtyard without sweeping the way so they don't inadvertantly step on an ant or a fly.
[14:14:16] <evolv> chanting is more of a thing for Vajrayana school
[14:14:26] <arryana> from where i sit, they're wasting their lives, and all the good they might be doing anyone else by a self absorbed inertia and idealistic notion that they can exist without harming anything.
[14:14:29] <arryana> they don't help anything either.
[14:14:37] <arryana> they might as well be a rock.
[14:14:39] <evolv> different flavors of Buddhism around, but the Vipassana Retreat thing is more like watered down Buddhism
[14:14:52] <arryana> no buddhism appeals to me.
[14:15:03] <Delf> Same here.. only buddha himself
[14:15:15] <evolv> it doesn't have to, but you don't have to throw shade at them
[14:15:29] <evolv> they don't feel they're wasting their lives
[14:15:30] <arryana> dude found a path that worked for him.  good for him.  but it's silly to think that walking someone else's road will ever bring you to your own truth.
[14:15:38] <arryana> no, they don't.  but i do.
[14:15:47] <arryana> i'm not throwing shade.
[14:15:50] <arryana> i'm calling it how i see it.
[14:15:58] <evolv> you're calling them useless
[14:16:00] <arryana> they're welcome to follow their convictions.
[14:16:13] <arryana> fine.  'to me that life would be useless'.
[14:16:14] <arryana> happy?
[14:16:28] <Delf> It's according her values
[14:16:35] <evolv> I don't understand why you're being divisive

[14:27:30] <evolv> amigojapan, I had an ex who had that from frequently going to loud concerts
[14:27:33] <Delf> evolv: Like she said, to her that life would be useless. This indicates that there is value elsewhere in what they could do. Not that they themselves are useless

[14:39:14] <Lumine> Hello
[14:39:36] <Delf> Lumine: What've you learned? Care to share?
[14:40:06] <Delf> Doesn't matter where I look, I see assholes. Especially in the mirror
[14:40:24] <Ungwelian> thunder, it's classic troll behaviour. Insult others, deny insulting others, gaslight that it's their fault they're insulted. Never admit guilt.
[14:40:40] <thunder> I'm aware
[14:40:55] <thunder> you forgot "suck up to supporters"
[14:41:02] <Ungwelian> Oh yeah.
[14:41:19] <Delf> Shots fired shots fired! I got hit by never admit guilt
[14:41:45] <Lumine> You don't want to know Delf
[14:41:55] <Ungwelian> For some reason, philosophy channels draw these kind of people.
[14:42:02] <Delf> Lumine: Of course I do. What fuck. That's why I'm asking
[14:42:08] <Ungwelian> It was extremely common in the Finnish one.
[14:42:24] <Delf> People who don't admit guilt?

[14:42:50] <Ungwelian> People who troll others and gaslight them for getting angry.
[14:42:58] <Delf> Ahh..
[14:43:14] <Ungwelian> In the Finnish one, the additional problem was that it was done by ops.
[14:43:25] <Ungwelian> Once a person was trolled angry enough, they were banned.

[14:45:02] <Delf> Well if it was a mistake I will try to mend it of course but that does not mean I regret it or that I feel guilty
[14:45:16] <Delf> I have no conscience mate
[14:46:08] <Lumine> I've learned that I'm stuck in a perpetual limbo in this channel. The same dynamic seems to arise every single day. And whether the people involved in it are getting their kicks out of it or just hopeful. Either way, it's ugly. I am of course free to ignore the conversation. But a good chunk of the energy available that would be otherwise freed up to discuss philosophical topics is being spent on correction of what people say or didn't say.
[14:47:41] <amigojapan> Lumine: give us some trivia
[14:48:52] <Delf> Lumine: That's interesting indeed. But this also gives us opportunity to learn from one another, about each other and ourselves, right? We don't have to stop communicating just because we don't share values or agree on everything. We have enough things in common already
[14:48:57] *** plankster_ is now known as plank
[14:49:50] <Delf> That's part of evolving and maturing up, both emotionally and logically
[14:50:53] <Delf> For example, I still have benevolent intentions, despite the hateful feelings I have towards many people in here
[14:52:14] <Lumine> But is it really learning, or repeating the same mistakes. That's what I'm wondering.
[14:52:52] <Delf> Your intention is within your domain. But the intention of other is NOT within your domain so you must only do your part and never try to do the part of others'
[14:53:35] <Delf> Some may have the intention to learn and some will not. This is not fixed. It comes and goes, we must accept it
[14:54:15] <Delf> What do you recon is the actual mistake, Lumine?

[22:55:55] <causative> panpsychism should really be the default assumption.  Everything we see is one "type" of object, namely: qualia, sense data.  On what basis would we assume a second type of object that we've never seen?  The default assumption should be that the things we have not seen are similar to the things we have seen.
[22:56:26] <causative> i.e. that the things we do not experience ourselves are also some form of sensory impressions
[22:57:11] <causative> we literally cannot even imagine an object that lacks any sensory impression - to imagine it is to form a sensory impression of it

[23:01:38] <causative> and we know that higher cognitive faculties are not necessary to simply have subjective experience; in zazen, we set our higher cognitive faculties aside and simply observe, and we remain conscious - more so

[23:02:14] <causative> as well, animals lack the human higher cognitive faculties and few would doubt that at least most animals have subjective experience
[23:08:28] <causative> the main objection I've heard to this is "oh, so you think a rock is conscious?"  This is exactly the fallacy of appeal to the stone:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeal_to_the_stone
[23:08:28] <ro-bot-o> [url] Appeal to the stone - Wikipedia | en.wikipedia.org
[23:09:23] <causative> because the person proposing it takes it as granted that it's absurd to say a stone is conscious, without providing any sound reasoning for why a stone can't be conscious
[23:10:29] <causative> a stone processes information and acts - sound waves, for example, come in to the stone, get mixed around and internally reflected, and are sent back out
[23:11:11] <causative> it would be computationally *very* intensive - technically impossible - to simulate how sound waves reflect inside a stone, in perfectly fine detail
[23:11:39] <evolv> a lens isn't conscious because it refracts light
[23:11:50] <causative> oh, and how is that different from appeal to the stone?
[23:12:02] <causative> it's exactly the same argument
[23:12:04] <evolv> because the term has to be informative
[23:12:10] <causative> and it's wrong for the same reason
[23:12:44] <evolv> which is?
[23:13:07] <causative> the reason I just explained for why it's wrong about the stone
[23:13:12] <causative> it's appeal to the stone
[23:13:28] <evolv> or it has something to do with why words are chosen
[23:13:53] <causative> "the term has to be informative" isn't a valid principle either, suppose the universe is made out of quarks (it probably isn't but suppose).  Would you then say, "this rock is made out of quarks" is then an invalid statement because it's not informative?
[23:14:45] <causative> it is possible for there to be universal properties that apply to everything in the universe
[23:14:55] <evolv> words are constructs. A sign
[23:15:12] <causative> and what is your answer to the question about the quarks?
[23:16:46] <evolv> what is the reference for the word?
[23:17:06] <evolv> without a reference, the word has no meaning
[23:17:14] <causative> quarks, the little things that are supposed to make up a proton
[23:17:25] <causative> and all other fundamental particles
[23:17:48] <evolv> ok, so we have a reference, thus a rock comprises quarks
[23:18:25] <causative> fine, well, we have a reference for consciousness - look around you, it's the "blueness of blue" and so on, the subjective nature of the different sense impressions
[23:19:04] <causative> so it is informative to say a rock has the same thing, when it processes information
[23:19:35] <evolv> it depends on area of interest
[23:20:21] <evolv> consciousness is a broad term in science, broader among laypeople, and generally, but not always, means the six sense bases in Buddhism
[23:21:00] <Delf> Holy shit, looks like something interesting is going on here. Brb
[23:21:16] <evolv> but in all instances there has to be a reference for the word to have meaning
[23:25:38] <evolv> so what is absurd is one a word is too broad as to capture anything meaningful about the phenomenon of interest
[23:26:41] <causative> well, when philosophers talk about the hard problem of consciousness, they aren't restricting themselves to "six sense bases" - they're referring to all and any subjective experience
[23:27:10] <evolv> philosophers will define their terms or reference work where the parameters are defined
[23:28:22] <evolv> and other philosophers will still point out the absurdity of that, as it relies on more words that, too, do not have rigid, universally held or understood definitions
[23:28:47] <causative> so you object to the use of "consciousness" at all when used in the sense of having subjective experiences
[23:28:54] *** Joins: ttree (~ttree0@c-73-169-193-237.hsd1.wa.comcast.net)
[23:29:50] <causative> I can't say that appeals to me - there is something it is *like* to be me, to have my experiences, something not tied to which experiences or what kind of experiences I'm having, but universal to all of them.  And it's meaningful to talk about that.
[23:30:32] <evolv> in this case, the subjective experience would be qualia, I believe
[23:30:50] <causative> yes, that's another word for subjective experiences
[23:31:09] <evolv> they aren't synonyms
[23:31:16] <evolv> not in the context in which qualia is used
[23:31:35] <evolv> and context matters a lot
[23:31:36] <causative> I use them as synonyms; what distinction do you make?
[23:31:39] <evolv> as I have explained above
[23:32:13] <evolv> when someone wants to discuss consciousness with me, I usually ask them what they mean by the term
[23:32:19] <causative> https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qualia/
[23:32:20] <ro-bot-o> [url] Qualia (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy) | plato.stanford.edu
[23:32:38] <causative> I'm using in the first sense, "(1) Qualia as phenomenal character."
[23:33:55] <causative> and consciousness is simply the property of having subjective experiences, i.e. having qualia
[23:34:06] <evolv> so a mental fabrication
[23:34:15] <evolv> and do rocks have mental fabrications?
[23:34:26] <causative> what are you calling a mental fabrication?
[23:36:42] <causative> please be specific what you're referring to, you wanted to be clearer about terms.
[23:36:51] <evolv> this can easily escalate into Buddhism if I go there
[23:37:11] <evolv> and I'm also working, so I can't give full attention
[23:38:00] <Delf> Can it escalate into Buddhism, causative?
[23:38:55] <causative> if it's relevant and justified - I won't take anything as an article of faith, but there is philosophy in Buddhism

[23:39:47] <causative> if evolv was referring to qualia as a mental fabrication - which for some reason he refused to clarify - I don't think that's quite accurate
[23:40:10] <causative> qualia is not something that comes after you have the mind - qualia is something the mind is built out of
[23:40:32] <causative> the mind doesn't fabricate qualia any more than a house fabricates its bricks

[23:41:48] <evolv> and to describe what these terms mean in Buddhism will take time
[23:42:30] <Delf> It doesn't have to be in Buddhism, evolv
[23:43:54] <evolv> Delf, it matters when it gets into certain details
[23:44:22] <Delf> Not saying that it doesn't matter. Just saying it doesn't have to get into Buddhism
[23:44:46] <evolv> but then what does it get into? Dennet's work?

[23:47:14] <causative> yes. if evolv accepts some views of Dennett, then let's talk about those views.  If evolv accepts some views of Buddhism, then let's talk about those views.
