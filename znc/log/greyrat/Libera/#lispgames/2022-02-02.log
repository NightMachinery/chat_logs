[21:45:08] <artchad> Can anyone help me with sdl2+gl related issue? Here is the code: https://paste.debian.net/plain/1229357
[21:45:33] <artchad> I thought that would show me a smiley, but it doesn't.
[21:46:10] <artchad> I'm trying to translate https://3bb.cc/tutorials/cl-opengl/textures.html to sdl2
[21:48:59] <artchad> It's the basic-test from sdl2/examples
[21:49:10] <artchad> with the addition of the texture code.
[21:56:54] <ecraven> no idea about that actual code, however this is *old* GL, using immediate mode, you shouldn't use this for anything. 
[21:57:52] <artchad> Not even for learning?
[21:57:55] <artchad> :D
[21:59:00] <ecraven> no, because in order to write a modern application, you'll have to forget *everything* you learn here ;)
[21:59:09] <ecraven> I'm not even sure this works on all drivers any longer

[22:01:29] <artchad> some are too old, some too new
[22:02:50] <artchad> lol
[22:02:51] <artchad> now it works
[22:02:59] <artchad> I just closed the window and restarted it...

[22:04:16] <artchad> ok, I can work with that. it works. it works
[22:06:27] <artchad> ecraven: You might view my situation from an ivory tower point of view. I'm very grateful for the lispbuilder-sdl tutorials that use old style opengl, because I can use it to get a foot hold in graphics programming.
[22:07:05] <artchad> Once I made one or two simple games with old opengl and familiarized myself a bit. Then I would dare to venture out into the world of modern OpenGL where tutorials are sparse.
[22:07:52] <artchad> at least for lisp that is. Translating c++ examples to lisp is not what I would be comfortable doing right now, if I don't even know how to use the api.
[22:36:53] <ecraven> I'm not sure how the CL opengl api works, but in all other languages I've seen the *C* API translates almost 1:1
[22:37:01] <ecraven> so you have the same function names and parameters.
[22:37:23] <ecraven> you can do whatever you want, just keep in mind that modern opengl is *nothing* like old opengl, so you have to unlearn everything you learn now.. (and I mean *everything* ;)
[22:37:38] <ecraven> you cannot call *any* of the functions you use now, everything works differently
[22:38:11] <ecraven> I've written some opengl code in Scheme, based on various C tutorials, it wasn't very hard to adjust ;)
[22:40:57] <artchad> I don't see it as unlearning. I see it as adding to my set of tools.
