[14:23:13] <Finnix> on client, which perform ping
[14:23:26] <Blondie101010> if the client IP matters, look at your bind config
[14:23:34] <Blondie101010> there are tons of configuration options

[19:08:40] <abrotman> dpkg: debootstrap
[19:08:40] <dpkg> debootstrap can create a basic Debian system from scratch, without apt/dpkg.  Useful for installing in a <chroot>. It is key to installing Debian GNU/Linux from a Unix/Linux system. http://wiki.debian.org/Debootstrap - https://www.debian.org/releases/bullseye/amd64/apds03.en.html

[19:10:34] <hentai> abrotman, Not really. It is just a set of the very base packages, removal of which is usually better done by hand, as the package management might no longer function without them
[19:10:51] <abrotman> hentai: aptitude search ~prequired ~pstandard
[19:10:53] <hentai> Yes, the second answer is one

[19:11:04] <hentai> abrotman, Oh, okay, thanks
[19:11:05] <abrotman> Matches packages whose priority is priority; priority must be extra, important, optional, required, or standard. For instance, ‚Äú?priority(required)‚Äù matches packages whose priority is ‚Äúrequired‚Äù.
[19:11:34] <hentai> So when I run debootstrap, the packages which are downloaded are...?
[19:11:38] <abrotman> hentai: and you can "aptitude install ~pstandard" for example

To prevent that my real IP address leaks when I use my vpn, I always delete this route: "default via 192.168.2.1 dev wlp3s0" So when I disconnect from the VPN, I'm not able to connect to the internet with the network I'm originally connected to and connect to my VPN when I start my computer. Now this always
[20:48:54] <maximilian91> worked, till today. I deleted this route and I'm still able to connect to the internet without VPN nevertheless. But only to specific sites. When I enter ip route in command line I get this: https://pastebin.com/merYH4tk I use Debian11
[20:49:07] <maximilian91> For instance, I just tried to connect to paste.rs. This didn't work, but pastebin.com worked.

[22:39:55] <somiaj> The only thing I found in the changelog was disabling it by default due to non systemd systems, but nothing about what issues it could cause if enabled. Seems even the manual page suggests a unit file (which is what is shipped by debian), it is just just disabled by default.
[22:40:22] <somiaj> https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=977804 is a bug that caused them to disable it by default
[22:40:23] <judd> Bug https://bugs.debian.org/977804 in xscreensaver (open): ¬´xscreensaver: systemd integration conflicts with existing Xsession based activation¬ª; severity: important; opened: 2020-12-21; last modified: 2021-01-10.

[22:59:17] <xx> I have screen blanking after 10 minutes automatically, but *don't* want it to lock. So that xscreensaver option is disabled. There are no other related options in xscreensaver. Then in xfce Power Manager I have "Lock screen when system is going to sleep" checked.
[23:00:03] <jelly> then it's probably not locking because locking is in fact disabled

[23:00:58] <jelly> xfce power manager is probably just using whatever dbus api to ask the screen saver to lock.  If the screen saver is configured not to lock... well.

[23:01:36] <xx> the xscreensaver-systemd binary says it would lock anyway, strange
[23:01:48] <jelly> they you probably need to teach xscreensaver-systemd to store original setting, enable locking, lock, and then restore original setting after resume
[23:02:26] <xx> I'm looking through xscreensaver-systemd.c to see what it does
[23:02:30] <jelly> where does it say that?
[23:02:37] <xx> in that source file
[23:03:06] <xx> https://github.com/mato/xscreensaver-systemd/blob/master/xscreensaver-systemd.c#L21
[23:03:17] <jelly> manual says it runs xscreensaver-command -suspend, and manual for that in turn says it's "like -activate except immediately blanks"

[23:05:56] *** Joins: kadir (~user@88.251.54.110)
[23:09:22] <jelly> xx, one suspects xscreensaver-command -suspend should probably be more like -lock instead of like -activate.  Does "xscreensaver-command -lock" in fact lock, regardless of the setting?
[23:09:58] <xx> yes, that successfully locks, regardless of the setting, so it behaves as the manpage describes
[23:10:23] <xx> I'm looking through the source code and indeed I'd instead expect it to run -lock instead of -suspend but don't know why it does what it does currently
[23:10:32] <xx> maybe because there are people who don't want to lock on suspend?
[23:10:53] <jelly> actual code is https://sources.debian.org/src/xscreensaver/5.45+dfsg1-2/driver/xscreensaver-systemd.c/#L473
[23:11:14] * xx only got to line 339 so far
[23:11:17] <jelly> and the comment there is more precise than the one on top of the file
[23:11:40] * jelly used ^F.  It was very effective!
[23:11:51] <jelly>     /* Tell xscreensaver that we are suspending, and to lock if desired. */
[23:11:57] <xx> oh, 339 is actually the same line as 473, I was just looking at older source code
[23:12:00] <jelly> IF DESIRED
[23:12:36] <xx> so I guess I have to enable locking, and set it to 100000000000000 minutes or something
[23:12:47] <xx> and xscreensaver-command -suspend ignores that time anyway
[23:13:20] <xx> I'll test that soon. If it works, it's a little counterintuitive but is a workaround
[23:13:46] <jelly> silly workaround: replace xscreensaver-command with a wrapper that runs -lock is callee is xscreensaver-systemd and it called -suspend
[23:13:53] <xx> All the stars in the universe will burn out before my computer locks :)

[23:20:57] <jelly> debian made a hasty decision to switch to it after the xscreensaver time bomb
[23:21:58] <xx> I read about that and didn't really like debian's decision.
[23:22:31] <xx> I would have preferred debian to simply upgrade to a newer version of xscreensaver because that tools seems to be very well coded and accounts for all the weird cases
[23:22:53] <xx> I mean, if firefox-esr gets a major upgrade during a suite lifetime, then why not a screenlocker?
[23:23:29] <jelly> debian doesn't deal well with upstreams with big egos
[23:24:17] <xx> true, that person seems to have abit of an ego, but backs it up with actual expertise from what I can tell
[23:24:20] <Cool_Fire> firefox is a far greater security risk than xscreensaver
