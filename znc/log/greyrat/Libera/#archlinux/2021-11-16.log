[03:06:25] <ectospasm> jcbjoe2021: I made the switch from screen to tmux several years ago.  GNU screen is not as orthogonal when it comes to configuration.  Also, I've noticed that GNU screen has memory leaks or something like that.  Over time those screen sessions can really bog down a system.

[04:17:08] <armin> ectospasm: what would you want this to do if not copy what you just selected?
[04:17:27] <ectospasm> In vim it's supposed to decrement the integer under the cursor.  And in Alacritty it works as expected.
[04:17:39] <armin> ah
[04:17:56] <ectospasm> iTerm2 has too many features that I don't use.
[04:18:08] <armin> ok i've never thought of decrementing an integer like this, but you do you
[04:18:24] <armin> it does, but it's still fairly usable 
[04:18:31] <armin> it's not that bad actually
[04:19:02] <ectospasm> I do find iTerm2 better than Terminal.app, but I prefer Alacritty.

[04:43:11] <armin> lol i never noticed
[04:44:11] *** kuroshi is now known as kode54
[04:44:23] <armin> but yea what i'm trying to say: void is grand, no question, artix is great, no question either, both are AWESOME. if arch without systemd is what you want, choose artix. 
[04:44:34] <topcat001> bparker: the engine is the same as chrome, with security patches backported regularly. Most chrome settings also work there. It also has incognito mode.
[04:44:49] <armin> i'm on arch currently nevertheless, not because of preference but just because it somewhat worked.
[04:44:56] <topcat001> I have never used Void.
[04:45:04] <armin> void is excellent.
[04:45:20] <bparker> topcat001: so... not possible then?
[04:45:26] <bparker> because you normally need extensions for that in chromium
[04:45:34] <topcat001> I loved gentoo but got tired of building everything
[04:45:44] <bparker> if so I wouldn't want to use it due to privacy concerns
[04:45:56] <armin> topcat001: lol just use arch or nixos i say

[04:47:00] <armin> well gentoo is fairly great, if you're used to it, if you used it for the last 2-3 years, yeah, then, gentoo is great.
[04:47:10] <armin> for any other human being, arch is far superior.
[04:47:22] <ectospasm> I gave up on Gentoo in 2005, when X.org took a week to compile.
[04:47:52] *** Joins: predmijat (~predmijat@mail.strogopro.com)
[04:47:56] <armin> re-compiling everything locally is just bollocks. nix (and nixos) prove this.
[04:48:07] <topcat001> bparker: there are some things you can do: https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/qutebrowser#Minimize_fingerprinting

[04:48:46] <armin> well arch comes pretty close to what i need
[04:48:59] <armin> topcat001: to what
[04:49:21] <topcat001> Are you referring to my link armin?

[04:50:29] <armin> oh
[04:50:34] <topcat001> not the distro topic
[04:51:02] <armin> i completely missed it, i tried qutebrowser for 2 or 3 times and i failed hard time to use it even

[04:51:24] <armin> it wasn't close to somewhat i consider replacing my everyday browser with so to day
[04:51:33] <armin> what stuff?
[04:51:59] <topcat001> I'm a dyed in the wool vi user - shell, browser, etc so qute suits me perfectly. However it is a very odd ui otherwise.
[04:52:06] <armin> anyways i tried to become comfortable with qutebrowser, i failed super hard time
[04:52:19] <topcat001> armin: I meant the quteb security discussion is very offtopic here.
[04:52:19] <armin> yea
[04:52:26] <topcat001> that stuff :)
[04:52:27] <armin> ah
[04:52:39] <armin> ok i lost track my apologies

[07:00:07] <Hydragyrum> why not grub-pc?
[07:00:10] <Aelius> generally, I make a separate boot partition, but last I was here, someone earnestly insisted that separate boot was not necessary

[07:00:35] <Hydragyrum> it can be quite helpful in many cases, especially if your root is unusual

[14:44:49] <Namarrgon> is the disk already using gpt?
[14:45:01] <avN0> yes

[14:46:13] <lb9di> need to write/generate a config too
[14:46:28] <Namarrgon> right
[14:46:44] <avN0> sry, for me this is included in "installing grub" :D 
[14:47:01] <avN0> but no system changes have to be made?
[14:47:14] <avN0> evtl. installing efibootmgr
[14:47:26] <Namarrgon> that is also part of "installing grub"

[15:18:30] <leana> I tried to add setxkblayout dvorak in ~/.xinitrc but it does nothing
[15:18:55] <Namarrgon> "setxkblayout"?
[15:19:44] <Namarrgon> https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Xorg/Keyboard_configuration#Using_X_configuration_files
[15:19:44] <phrik> Title: Xorg/Keyboard configuration - ArchWiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
[15:20:21] <leana> ah yeah sorry setxkbmap I meant
[15:20:29] <leana> I have to modify xorg.conf then ?
[15:20:37] <Namarrgon> how do you start qtile?
[15:20:57] <leana> I actually have gnome installed too so I launch it with gdm
[15:21:01] <Namarrgon> localectl can edit xorg.conf.d for you or you can write a snippet yourself
[15:21:09] <Namarrgon> gdm doesn't run ~/.xinitrc
[15:21:21] <leana> but the problem is that the password field in gdm is also in qwerty
[15:21:37] <Namarrgon> then change the layout system-wide
[15:22:07] <leana> Namarrgon: I see
[15:22:28] <leana> Change the layout system-wide ? I did it in /etc/vconsole.conf but that only affects tty I guess right

[15:27:32] <Namarrgon> it's only used for ordering of the configs

[15:28:36] <Namarrgon> if you are going to write the snippet manually then pick a different name, localectl is using that one already and you don't accidently overwrite your manual config

[15:31:06] <MacGyver> If it's supposed to override everything.

[15:32:24] <demonicmaniac1> configs are applied in ascending numerical order
[15:32:29] <demonicmaniac1> so 99 just means it happens last

[15:34:22] <leana> or more like 99-synaptics.conf
[15:34:51] <Namarrgon> if the setting you want to change is set by another config file then your config needs to be parsed later
[15:34:57] <MacGyver> Depends on how 70-synaptics.conf was generated, tbh.
[15:35:08] <Namarrgon> if the setting is just a built in default then the order doesn't matter
[15:35:11] <MacGyver> Everything in my /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/ is manual.

[18:27:08] <MacGyver> But it might not work without a working bootloader.
[18:27:30] <MacGyver> At least, that was last time I used it.
[18:28:36] <Khorne> But Grub supposedly is working
[18:29:06] <MacGyver> Uh, yeah, I meant a working windows bootloader on MBR.
[18:29:26] <kesson> os prober doesnt recognize windows
[18:29:30] <kesson> grub is working fine
[18:29:40] <kesson> I can boot arch very well and I am very happy
[18:29:51] <MacGyver> Could try installing ntfs-3g, mount the windows partition, and see if it picks it up then.
[18:30:09] <kesson> problem is, I need bitwig license I do not have, meanwhile I would be happy to make windows in ableton (:
[18:30:16] <MacGyver> I'm not sure why it would matter, but the wiki is adamant you do need to mount it seems.
[18:30:18] <kesson> ok great
[18:30:25] <Khorne> Could alwazs create a manual entry for windows

[18:30:29] <mikebutash> if your C: is intact for windoze, it *should* find it at least to try, unless it got scrambled somehow.
[18:30:30] <MacGyver> Or that, yes.
[18:30:46] <kesson> yep manual entry is good idea also but where to start?

[18:31:12] <mikebutash> well, if windoze can't fix windoze, that's a bigger issue

[18:39:32] <kesson> for making a manual entry
[18:40:07] <kesson> grub could be a bit overwhealming isn'it?
[18:40:24] <mikebutash> you're able to see the windows data on the ntfs partition?
[18:40:27] <MacGyver> What do you mean by "mounted everything to /mnt"?
[18:40:31] <MacGyver> What *exactly* did you do?
[18:40:44] <MacGyver> Because if you're overmounting the partitions of course os-prober is not going to see them.

[22:00:34] <demonicmaniac1> compositors and frameworks supporting hdr formats and tonemapping are a different kettle of fish

[22:01:49] <teraflops> I see, thanks for the into I'll search on the topic
[22:01:52] <demonicmaniac1> just doing 30bpp or 36bpp is much simpler than hdr
