[00:00:47] <causative_> but fortunately it is not necessary that the unethical prosper - it is possible for the system of ethics to include punishments for the unethical
[00:01:21] <causative_> so that the system of ethics becomes a stable equilibrium, benefiting the individual who practices as well as it benefits the group of all who practice

[00:05:52] <ProfSimm> causative_: another approach is to elevate the majority through education and so on, so they adopt a system of ethics more willingly. Our mind is malleable.
[00:06:18] <ProfSimm> causative_: another way to put it I guess would be "brainwash people"
[00:06:25] <causative_> even if they adopt it willingly, it will eventually die out unless there is personal gain in it for them
[00:06:51] <causative_> because there will be those who do practice and those who don't, and if there is no personal gain in it, the latter group will prosper and the former group will falter
[00:06:53] <ProfSimm> causative_: personal gain is subjectively defined.
[00:07:08] <causative_> reproductive fitness and power over society
[00:07:12] <ProfSimm> causative_: how about 30 virgins and so on in heaven

[00:07:42] <causative_> if the afterlife were the only reward, then people who follow it would become less powerful in this life
[00:07:56] <causative_> and those who don't follow it would soon outnumber them and be more powerful than them
[00:08:03] <ProfSimm> causative_: but you seem to not take into account specialization. Not all should reproduce and thrive in a system. Instead the system should.
[00:08:18] <ProfSimm> causative_: case in point your skin cells die by the millions to protect those within you.
[00:08:26] <ProfSimm> causative_: but the whole system works, so they keep dying
[00:09:06] <ProfSimm> causative_: you can see similar organization in ant and bee colonies. Most don't reproduce, but as long as the colony thrives, all thrive
[00:09:20] <causative_> that's because they have a different form of reproduction from humans
[00:09:30] <causative_> it works only because the workers don't reproduce
[00:09:39] <causative_> the same for the body
[00:09:45] <ProfSimm> causative_: well that's a bit of a cop out to say. Their "different system of reproduction" is that... most don't reproduce
[00:10:18] <causative_> yes, that's why you see such altruism in hive insects
[00:10:34] <ProfSimm> causative_: humans have the capability to reproduce via many means. They also have the means to reproduce less, but produce machines and tech to make them more powerful than a mass of poor people.
[00:10:41] <causative_> because the only way they can propagate their genes is by promoting the hive so that the queen reproduces, the queen being genetically very close to them
[00:10:53] <causative_> it's a form of kin selection
[00:10:59] <causative_> there is no such kin selection in human societies
[00:11:08] <ProfSimm> causative_: if I have a nuke, how do you plan to win by reproduction. Drop lots of babies on my city?
[00:11:34] <ProfSimm> causative_: technology and machines matter in the equation of power
[00:12:24] <causative_> we aren't yet in the age of AGI; societies are still dominated by the power and number of different groups of humans
[00:12:45] <causative_> a nuke is something that a human uses
[00:12:50] <ProfSimm> causative_: we're currently hybrid species. A human civilization, but not purely human inside. Technology co-exists with us. It's in symbiosis with us. We made it, but it's also distinct, like your children don't exactly act like they're your slaves
[00:13:15] <causative_> if a human uses a nuke to gain more power for himself, then the type of personality and ethic that led him to do that will gain power over time
[00:13:28] <causative_> and society over time will become full of people who would be willing to use nukes
[00:13:58] <ProfSimm> causative_: so you're poor in Africa, and wanna use nuke? Who cares?
[00:14:03] <ProfSimm> You don't have it
[00:14:27] <ProfSimm> You have a rusty knife.
[00:14:35] <causative_> well, that's not relevant because the people hypothetically using nukes to gain power for themselves won't have descendants who are poor in Africa
[00:14:46] <causative_> their descendants will be rich in the US or Russia
[00:15:05] <ProfSimm> causative_: sure but what's the problem of this model propagating. It's literally propagating right now
[00:15:14] <causative_> anyway, it's a bad example because using a nuke *doesn't* result in personal power
[00:15:16] <causative_> quite the opposite
[00:15:25] <ProfSimm> causative_: doesn't it. It won the world war
[00:16:09] <causative_> and who reproduced as a result?  it didn't get Eisenhower a lot of descendants
[00:16:16] <causative_> it didn't make him rich
[00:16:20] <ProfSimm> causative_: I can be morally against your actions, but if you have a gun and willing you use it, i have two options: submit, or die.
[00:16:22] <causative_> anyway, it wasn't necessary
[00:16:25] <causative_> Japan was already lost
[00:16:37] <causative_> and it's also beside the point because we're talking about using nukes in modern times
[00:16:47] <ProfSimm> causative_: you still think too narrowly about this. We're not rats.
[00:16:52] <causative_> in modern times, a nuke would seriously damage the global economic network, which the rich profit from
[00:17:02] <causative_> so the rich have no incentive to use one
[00:17:16] <ProfSimm> causative_: we live in bigger systems, where reproduce by system and by culture as much as we reproduce by genes. Individuals are irrelevant to the system
[00:17:36] <causative_> the system doesn't exist without individuals
[00:17:46] <causative_> and which specific individuals are in power, has a seriously large effect on what the system does
[00:17:55] <ProfSimm> causative_: you're missing my point.
[00:18:11] <causative_> I'm disagreeing with it, which is different
[00:18:40] <ProfSimm> causative_: no, you're talking about Eisenhower's descendants. If you think his descendants are only those who have his genes, you're missing the point
[00:18:55] <ProfSimm> causative_: his descendants are all those who walk in his footsteps and use the system he built.
[00:19:14] <causative_> evolution is still going on
[00:19:28] <ProfSimm> causative_: evolution is not only generic, but also cultural and cybernetic
[00:19:28] <causative_> just because we also have a competition of ideas doesn't mean we aren't still evolving in the usual genetic way - we are
[00:19:45] <ProfSimm> Who said we aren't?
[00:20:01] <ProfSimm> But it doesn't matter, because culture moves few orders of magnitude faster than genetics
[00:20:23] <ProfSimm> memes > genes
[00:20:47] <causative_> in the long run genetics catches up, unless you're banking on a complete singularity
[00:20:52] <causative_> culture is limited by genetics
[00:21:01] <ProfSimm> causative_: when a system has a problem with reproduction, it would solve it easily.
[00:21:05] <causative_> you can't have an advanced culture among rhesus monkeys
[00:21:13] <causative_> because they don't have the genetics to do so
[00:21:18] <ProfSimm> causative_: it doesn't because countries like the US assimilate.
[00:21:40] <ProfSimm> The way you eat chicken, the US eats immigrants, and turns them into Americans.
[00:21:41] <causative_> personality is heritable
[00:21:44] <inhahe> i'm not following this conversation but i'd like to point out that naturtal selection hardly applies ot us anymore because of domestication and medical technology
[00:22:00] <causative_> personality is 30-60% heritable
[00:22:05] <inhahe> and sexual selection doesn't seem to apply either, everyone and their brother gets together
[00:22:26] <ProfSimm> causative_: so by your own math 70%-40% isn't heritable, so where does it come from? Culture
[00:22:27] <causative_> sexual selection is part of natural selection
[00:23:45] <causative_> ProfSimm, culture is made possible *only by* genetics - sure culture is variable, and explains a lot, but this is in the short term. Think about a guy on a slow moving barge running back and forth on the deck. His position is the sum of the barge position + his position on deck. And because he's running and the barge is slow, most of the variation in his position is due to his running.
[00:24:11] <causative_> but in the long term, the variation in his position is due to the slow motion of the barge, because that limits where he can run
[00:24:19] <inhahe> i think we've entered a phase of genetic drift and mankind is going to get weaker, dumber, and more genetically dependent on civilization/infrastructure and advanced medical technology
[00:24:44] <ProfSimm> causative_: all in all I agree with your overall theme, that a "superior" system (according to morale etc.) will perish if it doesn't dominate others. But I disagree in analyzing this literally at the level of each individual. Cults thrive despite most of their members kill themselves. It's fine, they get more members.
[00:25:15] <causative_> ProfSimm, this is negative selection pressure against people willing to join such cults
[00:25:24] <causative_> if it continues, eventually people won't be willing to do that anymore
[00:25:56] <ProfSimm> causative_: eventually yes, but eventually doesn't mean inevitably. If you drink enough water you'll die. Doesn't mean drinking water is bad.
[00:26:00] <causative_> such a cult can never be dominant in society in the long term - it defeats itself
[00:26:26] <ProfSimm> causative_: all major religions prove otherwise. They all started as cults
[00:26:40] <causative_> and none of them are suicidal in a major way
[00:26:55] <causative_> Catholocism has explicit commandments to go forth and multiply, and that suicide is a deadly sin
[00:27:00] <ProfSimm> causative_: you have to shift gears as you scale. But it doesn't mean that being suicidal was wrong initially
[00:27:34] <ProfSimm> causative_: you see, as I noted earlier, systems evolve to survive. The moment a system sees a bottleneck, it'll evolve to bypass it
[00:27:53] <ProfSimm> causative_: doesn't mean a specific constraint is fatal just because one day it'll be fatal. One day it may change
[00:27:53] <causative_> or it dies
[00:27:59] <causative_> most cults do fail
[00:28:05] <causative_> most species fail
[00:28:34] <ProfSimm> causative_: as long as you only care about "most X fail" and don't understand why those that survived... survived, despite starting the same way, you're gaining no insight
[00:28:39] <causative_> it is possible that a cult could have some ideas that work for it initially but are counterproductive when it's larger, so it changes policy as it grows, you are right about that
[00:28:56] <causative_> but then its initial ideas that only work at the small scale can't be taken as a universal system of ethics
[00:29:06] <causative_> they can't spread through society, they can't dominate society
[00:29:11] <ProfSimm> Well no, but I mean there's no universal anything about ethics.
[00:29:14] <causative_> the cult may succeed but those specific ideas will fail
[00:29:17] <ProfSimm> It's always a moving platform
[00:29:39] <causative_> they can't spread through society, they can't dominate society
[00:29:53] <ProfSimm> Ethics is essentially a form of contract. But instead of appealing to punishment, like law, it appeals to emotion
[00:29:56] <causative_> that's the real question is what ideas can dominate society in the long term?
[00:30:03] <ProfSimm> Contracts evolve
[00:30:33] <causative_> and purely altruist ideas that involve no personal benefit cannot dominate human society in the long term, because those who advocate those ideas will lose personal power, and those who "cheat" will gain power in the long run
[00:30:43] <ProfSimm> causative_: I think ideas that dominate in the long run are ideas that can change
[00:30:56] <causative_> if an idea changed it's a different idea
[00:31:13] <ProfSimm> causative_: if your cells change are you a different person
[00:31:21] <ProfSimm> causative_: it's relative. Everything changes.

[00:35:38] <ProfSimm> Well, even that... can turn out naive at some point
[00:35:42] <ProfSimm> I can even tell you how
[00:35:45] <causative_> all propagating systems need to represent truths about their environment in order to choose actions effectively
[00:35:58] <causative_> if they represent the wrong things, then they will choose actions ineffectively
[00:36:02] <causative_> and will fail to prosper
[00:36:07] <ProfSimm> causative_: systems don't need truth. They just need useful predictions.
[00:36:19] <ProfSimm> causative_: a useful prediction is much more narrow and subjective than truth
[00:36:26] <causative_> truth is what produces useful predictions
[00:36:33] <ProfSimm> No, models produce predictions.
[00:36:40] <ProfSimm> And models are never truth, they're models.
[00:36:48] <ProfSimm> Simplified, biased constructs
[00:36:49] <causative_> no, models can be true
[00:37:11] <causative_> for instance, the Earth is generally round in shape - this is a model, and it's true
[00:37:13] <ProfSimm> Would you say any map represents the exact truth of the terrain?
[00:37:38] <causative_> sometimes, yes, a map can perfectly capture some feature of the territory
[00:37:45] <ProfSimm> Some feature.
[00:37:46] <causative_> other times it's relative - a model can be mostly true
[00:37:58] <ProfSimm> Truth is not interpretive.
[00:38:03] <causative_> "the Earth is generally round in shape" is perfectly true
[00:38:12] <causative_> "the Earth is a sphere in shape" is mostly true, a little bit false
[00:38:48] <ProfSimm> causative_: if it was generally round, then I wouldn't get a flat tire while driving on Earth

[00:38:57] <causative_> generally

[00:39:51] <inhahe> causative_: what do you say to people who argue that a thing cannot be 'mostly' true or false or true/false in any other degree, but only wholly true or false?
[00:39:52] <ProfSimm> I think a more objective statement would be some feature of topology
[00:39:55] <ProfSimm> But anyway
[00:40:14] <causative_> inhahe, I tell them to read "the relativity of wrong" by isaac asimov
[00:40:29] <causative_> https://hermiene.net/essays-trans/relativity_of_wrong.html
[00:40:30] <ro-bot-o> [url] The Relativity of Wrong by Isaac Asimov | hermiene.net
[00:40:34] <inhahe> thx
[00:40:39] <ProfSimm> causative_: well the relativity of right is implied there
[00:40:42] <causative_> or "fuzzy logic" by bart kosko
[00:40:51] <causative_> can't link to that one, it's a paper book
[00:41:05] <ProfSimm> "However, I don't think that's so. It seems to me that right and wrong are fuzzy concepts, and I will devote this essay to an explanation of why I think so."
[00:41:18] <ProfSimm> I think Asimov kind of argues my side about truth being relative
[00:42:01] <causative_> no, that's my side, you argued that models aren't perfect and comprehensive representations of their territories, and therefore none of them are true
[00:42:20] <causative_> that's a binary view of truth - that either the model is completely true or completely false, and even a little difference between the model and the territory means it's totally false
[00:42:32] <causative_> my counterpoint is that the model can be a little bit wrong but mostly right
[00:42:40] <causative_> I'm the one taking the relative view of truth here, not you
[00:43:02] <causative_> unless you're changing your mind
[00:43:10] <ProfSimm> I didn't say they're not "true" but they're not "truth".
[00:43:12] <causative_> but "truth doesn't exist" is a world apart from "truth is relative"
[00:43:20] <ProfSimm> Truth is not a purpose-built model with specific goals in mind.
[00:43:30] <ProfSimm> Truth is an attempt to represent absolute reality
[00:43:40] <causative_> no
[00:43:45] <ProfSimm> Well all right then
[00:43:55] <causative_> truth is what is actually the case in absolute reality
[00:44:10] <ProfSimm> Uhm isn't this saying the same?
[00:44:22] <causative_> the distinction is between what we attempt to represent, and what is actually the case
[00:44:25] <causative_> they are two different things
[00:44:36] <causative_> what we attempt to represent is often not actually the case
[00:44:46] <ProfSimm> causative_: so what happens if some cosmic object passes by us and tomorrow you wake up with cube Earth
[00:45:16] <causative_> we all die from a cubic cataclysm
[00:45:52] <ProfSimm> causative_: I'm a programmer, and we learn that singletons are bad in there :) Singletons are objects that are always unique, single, and globally available. They're absolute. We learn nothing is ever single, and absolute. And hence everything is relative and contextual

[00:46:44] <causative_> there isn't
[00:46:53] <ProfSimm> Well, no singletons
[00:47:16] <causative_> if in some system you find the theorem "2+2=5" then the system is using a different definition of some of the symbols - it's not the same meaning of 2+2=5
[00:47:43] <ProfSimm> causative_: well, you can easily have a system where 2 + 2 = 4 is undefinable at all
[00:48:01] <causative_> you should learn Prolog, a system in which the program is defined by true statements
[00:48:45] <causative_> programs in Prolog tend to be very succinct
[00:49:04] <ProfSimm> causative_: in programming, true statements are that which the function says "it's true". It's not actual truth about anything. It's just jargon we use. One reason why I hate "true" and "false" for booleans. They should've called them something else

[00:49:46] <ProfSimm> causative_: computers will gain sentience when they get to decide what's true and false, instead of being told.
[00:50:22] <ProfSimm> causative_: and therein lies the crux, truth is objective only from a subjective point of view :P
[00:50:27] <ProfSimm> It's a paradox.
[00:50:59] <causative_> truth is what a reasonable person would conclude if they spent enough time investigating the evidence and thinking
[00:51:06] <causative_> that's a definition
[00:51:44] <ProfSimm> causative_: a reasonable person has to work within the framework he exists in. That framework is never absolute. We correlate features of it, and conclude "ok this fits" (true) or "it doesn't fit" (false). That's all we do.
[00:51:59] <ProfSimm> causative_: but the framework we take for granted... may not actually fit a bigger framework
[00:52:01] <causative_> no, there's more to it than that, you have to follow your finger
[00:52:04] <ProfSimm> causative_: and so your whole world collapses
[00:52:20] <causative_> there's what we judge to be true in the moment, and there's what we judge to be false in the moment
[00:52:22] <inhahe> I don't think truth exists outside of our understanding of reality. If things outside our heads could be true, then it stands to reason that they should be able to be false, too. But what would it mean for something that's not an idea/proposition to be false? It makes no sense. If everything is necessarily true then truth has no meaning.
[00:52:58] <causative_> there's what we judge to be true in the moment, and there's what we judge to be false in the moment.  And these are not truth - these are judgments which may or may not coincide with truth.  Truth is not what we judge in the moment, but what we *would* judge if we *saw all the relevant evidence* and thought it over, eventually.
[00:53:05] <causative_> truth is the *limit* of investigation, not the judgment in the present
[00:53:10] <ProfSimm> inhahe: that's a very good insight
[00:53:53] <ProfSimm> inhahe: impriting true and false on information is a purely subjective thing to do. Not something that exists out there
[00:54:29] <ProfSimm> inhahe: heck if we take QM literally, reality is kind of undecided itself :P
[00:54:53] <causative_> the wavefunction is a global, deterministic state
[00:55:17] <ProfSimm> It's literally a probability function, the opposite of deterministic.
[00:55:22] <causative_> nope
[00:55:41] <causative_> the values of the wavefunction are "probability amplitudes," which are not probabilities
[00:55:47] <causative_> and the evolution of the wavefunction over time is fully deterministic
[00:56:18] <ProfSimm> You can claim that only in the Everett interpretation
[00:56:31] <ProfSimm> And even then I'd say we know way too little to claim what's deterministic and what isn't
[00:56:49] <inhahe> it's only presumption to say that quantum events are deterministic until you actually devise a way to predict them
[00:56:52] <causative_> no, we can indeed claim that it is deterministic - that's what the equations say
[00:57:08] <ProfSimm> inhahe: good way to put it
[00:57:11] <causative_> given the value of the wavefunction at a particular time, its values at past and future times are determined by the schrodinger equation
[00:57:58] <causative_> wavefunction collapse is an unnecessary assumption
[00:57:58] <ProfSimm> causative_: it's a circular argument. The wavefunction is deterministic because it's what it's defined as.
[00:58:16] <causative_> yes, much like how 7 is prime because it's what it's defined as
[00:58:16] <ProfSimm> causative_: you can't see that function. You can't measure it
[00:58:30] <causative_> well, we're talking about the consequences of QM
[00:58:37] <causative_> in QM, the function is there
[00:59:13] <ProfSimm> So by that definition, everything we have a math model about... is deterministic, because math is deterministic.
[00:59:30] <causative_> we can model nondeterminism in math
[00:59:34] <causative_> but QM is not an example of that
[01:00:21] <inhahe> if QM is not an example of modeling nondeterminism in math, then why do QM predictions only exist as probabilities?
[01:00:48] <causative_> because we are part of the wavefunction and limited in our perspective
[01:00:59] <causative_> probability describes an agent's lack of knowledge about something
[01:01:03] <ProfSimm> causative_: so you take the Everett interpretation again
[01:01:12] <causative_> wavefunction collapse is an unnecessary assumption
[01:01:14] <ProfSimm> Which is OK, as long as it's clear it's just one interpretation
[01:01:37] <inhahe> the nondeterminism in QM could be "absolute randomness." i think this is a popular view among physicists.
[01:02:01] <inhahe> how can we say for sure that it's merely a lack of knowledge?
[01:02:13] <ProfSimm> In the Copenhagen interpretation, the deterministic wavefunction collapses non-deterministically.
[01:02:18] <inhahe> when we have no way to predict it even in principle
[01:02:50] <causative_> wavefunction collapse is not necessary, it's an extraneous addition to the model that occam's razor says to remove
[01:03:00] <ProfSimm> causative_: that's Everett.
[01:03:06] <inhahe> causative_: do you belive in MWT?
[01:03:16] <causative_> yes inhahe what else am I saying?
[01:03:17] <inhahe> +e
[01:03:18] <ProfSimm> inhahe: well he clearly doe s:)
[01:03:22] <inhahe> ok
[01:03:38] <causative_> the born rule can be derived from the schrodinger equation alone
[01:03:54] <causative_> which means we don't need, and should not have, any additional assumption of collapse to account for it
[01:04:08] <ProfSimm> causative_: well look, even though I'm also a fan of that model, if this is our bar for truth, i.e. "I just like this a lot, because it's simpler", you can see how I don't believe in truth
[01:04:14] <inhahe> causative_: do you believe that every possible quantum outcome is made manifest 'somewhere'?
[01:04:46] <causative_> no ProfSimm I told you what the bar for truth is
[01:04:56] <causative_> you don't seem to have acknowledged or commented on it
[01:05:13] <causative_> truth is the *limit* of investigation, not the judgment in the present
[01:05:17] <ProfSimm> causative_: truth only exists relative to a model.
[01:05:27] <ProfSimm> And all models are relative.
[01:06:10] <causative_> so you still have no comment on what I'm saying is the central definition of truth?
[01:06:22] <ProfSimm> causative_: I don't understand what you're saying well
[01:06:43] <causative_> well, let's say someone wants to investigate a car crash and decide who is at fault
[01:06:50] <inhahe> i guess he's saying truth is what you get when you've found out all you possibly can?
[01:07:08] <causative_> initially the investigator may decide person A is at fault
[01:07:14] <causative_> this is not the truth
[01:07:32] <causative_> later the investigator sees more information and may decide person B is really at fault - and this may not be the truth either
[01:07:46] <inhahe> it's what you arrive at when you can no longer disprove yourself?
[01:07:47] <causative_> and his judgment may switch back and forth between A and B some number of times
[01:07:48] <ProfSimm> inhahe: it seems like a pragmatic approach, but also not one guaranteed to find truth
[01:07:59] <causative_> but *eventually*, if he saw *all* possible information, he would settle on one
[01:08:14] <causative_> and what he would settle on, in the *limit* of his investigation, is the truth
[01:08:19] <inhahe> so truth only exists as a hypothetical =P
[01:08:30] <ProfSimm> causative_: you literally defined truth as a subjective assessment
[01:08:52] <causative_> do you understand the distinction I am making between a subjective assessment in the present, and truth?
[01:08:57] <ProfSimm> causative_: I don't know. I think you defined "conclusion" not "truth"
[01:10:11] <causative_> suppose the investigator investigates for three days and decides it was person A
[01:10:34] <causative_> do you understand the difference between the investigator's conclusion from his three-day investigation, and the truth, as I am defining it?
[01:10:39] <ProfSimm> causative_: suppose another investigator comes along and decides it was a new person C. What happens to truth.
[01:10:53] <inhahe> I wonder if there are multiple possible truths to settle on, even after you've seen all possible information? Consider that our mental models are necessarily vast reductions (and, presumably, a translation of the non-ideational to the ideational). There should, in principle, be different possible, maybe even competing ways to collapse the absolute reality into a small nugget of mental
[01:10:53] <inhahe> understanding

[01:11:06] <mycroftiv> causative_: what about issues like the continuum hypothesis?
[01:11:21] <causative_> ProfSimm, please stay within the bounds of the example
[01:11:46] <causative_> there's no person C, there's no other investigator.
[01:11:51] <mycroftiv> there are many propositions for which even with all possible evidence, we cannot assign a deterministic truth value, we would have to add additional postulates
[01:11:59] <causative_> mycroftiv, I would say these cannot be said to be true or false
[01:12:01] <ProfSimm> causative_: it is within the bounds of your example, that investigations can be reopened and conclusions changed
[01:12:07] <causative_> precisely for the reason you stated, mycroftiv
[01:12:48] <mycroftiv> causative_: they are not true or false in all models - they are true in some models and false in others, but figuring out what model is the 'most true' is very unclear
[01:13:20] <causative_> well, then a reasonable person would eventually agree "the continuum hypothesis is true in model A."  and he would agree "the continuum hypothesis is false in model B."
[01:13:40] <causative_> but he would not conclude, unconditionally, that "the continuum hypothesis is true."
[01:13:47] <causative_> so no truth value would be assigned to it
[01:13:51] <mycroftiv> so even from a strict mathematical point of view, the idea that there is a single 'convergent limit of truth' that we can effectively use in reality is often not true i think
[01:14:10] <mycroftiv> because this phenomena of 'multiple consistent models' keeps repeating itself
[01:14:26] <causative_> no, because the individual reasoner has his own model that he starts with
[01:14:28] <mycroftiv> and so for each collection of data points, there is always an infinite number of possible curves connecting them
[01:14:35] <causative_> that's the model in which we are evaluating truth
[01:14:39] <causative_> the one he starts with
[01:14:47] <mycroftiv> im trying to -discover- what model i am inside
[01:14:52] <causative_> yes
[01:15:01] <causative_> and in the model humans start with, probably there is no way to derive the truth or falsehood of the continuum hypothesis
[01:15:09] <causative_> so the truth of that must be undefined
[01:15:10] <mycroftiv> by gathering evidence to determine its nature - but math and science impose a lot of limits on this which means there are multiple consistent models of my own experience

[01:16:25] <ProfSimm> I think it's the fundamental nature of reality that truths are all relative to models. Models are all relative to their base axioms. And reality is an all-encompassing model we exist in, based on axioms just as well, and outside it, those axioms are irrelevant.
[01:16:33] <causative_> there is some model you start with
[01:16:39] <causative_> your brain already has this model
[01:17:08] <mycroftiv> im trying to create a model to use, from many choices
[01:17:15] <causative_> you already are using a model
[01:17:20] <causative_> you can't escape the bounds of the model you start with
[01:17:22] <inhahe> ProfSimm: reality is a model? what is it a model *of*? :P
[01:17:33] <mycroftiv> causative_: that is formally untrue. forcing changes that.
[01:17:36] <causative_> even if you choose another model and decide to use that, the decision to use that other model is a decision of your original model
[01:17:47] <causative_> which means the conclusions of that other model are all conclusions of your original model
[01:17:51] <causative_> so you still can't change your original model
[01:17:58] <causative_> your original model *is* you
[01:18:01] <ProfSimm> inhahe_: that's a good question. But "model" can be understood more widely as a "construct". Not necessarily modeled after something.
[01:18:16] <ProfSimm> inhahe_: maybe it's model of something, maybe not :P
[01:18:21] <inhahe> ProfSimm: is what you said philosophical idealism?
[01:18:31] <mycroftiv> causative_: im sorry, but i believe that is not mathematicall accurate. i refer to the work Hamkins and Woodin in set/model theory for this, if we want toget to the details
[01:18:56] <causative_> what details?
[01:18:59] <inhahe> ProfSimm: i think axioms are abstractions
[01:19:02] <ProfSimm> inhahe: I don't know.
[01:19:20] <inhahe> reality isn't based on axioms, which are ideas, unless idealism is true
[01:19:23] <mycroftiv> the questions of moving between models and creating new models and how it affects our view of truth
[01:19:27] <ProfSimm> inhahe_: I think about axioms as foundational constraints, which hold up a model/construct
[01:19:37] <inhahe> hmm
[01:19:40] <causative_> very well mycroftiv and what theorem of Hamkins and Woodin do you think is relevant?
[01:20:28] <mycroftiv> causative_: i would say their two lectures and papers -which present contrasting views actually - at the EFI conference, which i can find links for in a moment
[01:20:28] <inhahe> ProfSimm: what's the difference between an axiom of reality and a fundamental law of physics?
[01:20:48] <causative_> mycroftiv, if you're saying I'm mathematically incorrect then there must be one specific theorem that proves me wrong
[01:20:52] <ProfSimm> inhahe_: maybe "ideas" have some material expression, but more neutrally I see them as constraints. As rules. Restrictions from "everything everywhere all at once" to something more specific
[01:21:01] <causative_> mycroftiv, so don't link me to lectures and papers - give me that one theorem
[01:21:10] <causative_> or retract your claim
[01:21:41] <mycroftiv> http://arxiv.org/abs/1108.4223 is a hamkins link, im going to need some time to read and cross reference
[01:21:41] <ro-bot-o> [url] [1108.4223] The set-theoretic multiverse | arxiv.org
[01:21:50] <causative_> I cannot be refuted by a "general attitude"
[01:21:53] <ProfSimm> inhahe: what's the difference between law of physics and axiom of reality. Well the latter is based on our simpler mental model of reality, while the latter is objective.
[01:22:01] <mycroftiv> http://logic.harvard.edu/EFI_Woodin_TheContinuumHypothesis.pdf
[01:22:25] <mycroftiv> causative_: i said im happy to find the specifics, ill just need a bit
[01:22:27] <ProfSimm> inhahe_: well it's not objective absolutely, it's objective... within the specific reality we exist in. That construct
[01:23:01] <inhahe> ProfSimm: can you hold all realities under one coherent overarching truth?
[01:23:16] <causative_> frankly I don't see how what I said could possibly be wrong
[01:23:20] <ProfSimm> inhahe: that's the infinity dollar question, isn't it
[01:23:45] <causative_> you begin with your brain biology, and your brain biology dictates how you think
[01:23:48] <ProfSimm> inhahe: heck I wish I knew, if there is some some truly absolute truth
[01:23:53] <causative_> and everything you think after that is just a consequence of that original system - your brain biology
[01:24:11] <causative_> if you decide to adopt ZFC, then the conclusions of ZFC are also conclusions of your brain biology
[01:24:25] <causative_> if you decide to adopt ZF and not C, then the conclusions of that are also conclusions of your brain biology
[01:24:29] <causative_> you can't escape where you started
[01:24:58] <ProfSimm> inhahe: just so I'm not too vague, I'll say something more specific.
[01:25:09] *** Joins: lckdscl (~lckdscl@user/lckdscl)
[01:25:31] <causative_> ProfSimm, do you at least acknowledge the difference between what someone judges at a particular time, and what they *would* judge after seeing *all* the evidence and thinking through *all* the relevant ideas?
[01:25:39] <ProfSimm> inhahe: even if there is absolute truth above it all, it's possibly countless levels removed from out reality and likely completely incomprehensible to our brain
[01:26:27] <mycroftiv> causative_: ok, i think i can state this precisely, Woodin in that paper argues that some ideas of the set theoretic multiverse arent properly multiversal because they do make all truth assessible from the starting model, and we want the versions of the multiverse that do not
[01:26:30] <ProfSimm> causative_: ok I kind of understand what you mean by limit now. A hypothetical omniscient investigator.
[01:26:41] <inhahe> ProfSimm: can there be an absolute truth above it all if existence is infinitely large?
[01:27:16] <ProfSimm> causative_: I don't know what an omniscient investigator would know and see, so I can't decide if what he'd see is truth.
[01:27:45] <ProfSimm> causative_: or maybe he'd collapse to madness from knowing it all. Because to know all is to know nothing.
[01:27:45] <causative_> ProfSimm, we may suppose he has the ability to query the state of the universe at any time and place
[01:27:45] <ProfSimm> :)
[01:27:55] <causative_> and he can write down things and consult computers
[01:27:58] <inhahe> if omniscience isn't enough to give you truth, what is?
[01:28:06] <causative_> and he has as much time as he wants to do that
[01:28:10] <causative_> but otherwise he's just like you
[01:28:33] <causative_> imagine yourself, in front of a viewing window that can show you anything in the universe at any time and place, and with unlimited time to investigate
[01:28:41] <causative_> that's the kind of omniscience the investigator has
[01:29:03] <ProfSimm> inhahe: the problem with omniscience is that there's a good chance that a human-like consciousness can never be omniscient. We define what we believe in contrast to what we don't believe.
[01:29:09] <inhahe> if he's a flat-earther he'll still believe the earth is flat, even after that
[01:29:17] <causative_> no he won't
[01:29:19] <ProfSimm> inhahe: to know all eventually would result in a mind that accepts all possibilities as it knows all possibilities
[01:29:31] <ProfSimm> inhahe: hence an omniscient being would be the same as a piece of rock
[01:29:51] <causative_> inhahe, all he has to do is look and he will find the evidence that the earth isn't flat
[01:30:04] <causative_> after enough looking, the fact of the matter will be undeniable
[01:30:04] <inhahe> causative_: he could believe it's an illusion
[01:30:28] <inhahe> causative_: descartes evil demon tricking him
[01:30:31] <ProfSimm> causative_: in the context I exist in, I'm fine with saying Earth is round. But we're talking bigger things here.
[01:30:35] <causative_> well, a reasonable person would assign some probability to the idea that it's an illusion
[01:30:42] <causative_> but he wouldn't stop there
[01:30:49] <causative_> he'd keep on investigating the idea that it isn't an illusion
[01:30:53] <inhahe> flat earther's aren't reasonable people
[01:31:10] <causative_> I think they have the seed of reason and enough time, perhaps more time than a human lifetime, could let it flourish
[01:31:11] <inhahe> which is why i chose that example
[01:31:16] <causative_> I think everyone has the seed of reason
[01:31:27] <causative_> but anyway, I did specify that truth is what a reasonable person would decide in the limit
[01:31:30] <ProfSimm> I just see the geometry of Earth as a question that exists in a specific framework. Not an absolute question
[01:31:34] <inhahe> causative_: oh ok
[01:31:36] <causative_> if he's truly not reasonable then he's disqualified
[01:31:52] <causative_> mycroftiv, what do you mean by the "set theoretic multiverse"?
[01:31:54] <mycroftiv> causative_: Woodin offers in the paper i linked two 'multiverse laws' about what should and shouldnt be definable on page 6 and says the generic multiverse position violates those laws.
[01:32:01] <inhahe> causative_: is there an objective way to judge or define reasonableness?
[01:32:48] <causative_> inhahe, we have intuitions about it, and the ultimate standard is what is reasonable to you, as an individual
[01:32:58] <inhahe> waht if i'm a flat earther?
[01:32:59] <causative_> i.e. what methods of thinking you would approve of upon sufficient reflection
[01:33:06] <mycroftiv> causative_: the standard object that set theorists study as they usually talk about it. so Woodin believes the essence of correctly defining the settheoretic multiverse is that you cannot analyze its truths from one single universe
[01:33:15] <causative_> if you were an *unreasonable* flat-earther then you'd be very confused
[01:33:49] <causative_> of course, when I say the ultimate standard is what is reasonable to you, I also mean it is what is reasonable to me; we each must judge based on what is reasonable to ourselves
[01:33:56] <causative_> we have no choice
[01:34:16] <inhahe> causative_: that leaves truth open to being relative
[01:34:21] <inhahe> or subjectiwve
[01:34:46] <causative_> well, it leaves open different notions of truth, but for *me*, there is only one notion of truth, and it is what I would call objective
[01:34:56] <ProfSimm> causative_: in a way flat earther is less confused, as they see flat earth and they think it's flat, and they never have to deal with launching satellites.
[01:34:59] <causative_> just because someone else has a different opinion doesn't change my judgment
[01:35:10] <ProfSimm> causative_: it's a bit like how you don't think about general relativity while playing ball.
[01:35:13] <causative_> and the same for you inhahe
[01:35:52] <inhahe> ProfSimm: but flat earthers don't just think the earth is locally flat, they think it's flat on the grandest scale
[01:36:10] <inhahe> so they're thinking about general relativity while playing ball and denying it
[01:36:48] <ProfSimm> inhahe: yes, but unless they need to deal with worldwide travel and the like, this doesn't make their model less predictive than round earth. It makes their model simpler though, which may help them fit it into fewer brain cells and get on with their life
[01:37:28] <ProfSimm> inhahe: people rejected general relativity for a long time too. Calling it "jew science' and what not
[01:37:42] <ProfSimm> inhahe: we don't want to let go of simplicity. It confuses us
[01:37:58] <causative_> mycroftiv, what do you mean by "all truth accessible from the starting model, and we want the versions of the multiverse that do not"?
[01:38:58] <ProfSimm> inhahe: and Einstein refused to believe in entanglement
[01:39:05] <causative_> also mycroftiv it should be noted that in the strictly logical sense I am not talking about models, I'm talking about logical systems
[01:39:13] <inhahe> ProfSimm: or randomness
[01:39:15] <causative_> that is - our brains do not contain a model of ZFC
[01:39:33] <causative_> our brains contain a logical system that can derive judgments
[01:39:40] <ProfSimm> inhahe: goes to show in general we find simpler models better, until proven otherwise beyond doubt. Flat Earthers have a simple model of flat earth, it works for them, and so it's all fine with them
[01:39:52] <mycroftiv> causative_: um i have a long quote from the woodin paper but my vnc copy paste has scrambled it a bit, i will massage it into better shape and paste it in a moment
[01:40:12] <inhahe> ProfSimm: i don't think simplicity is the key here. it's more like outlandishness (wrt your intuitive worldview)
[01:40:15] <ProfSimm> inhahe: I'm sure QM and GR as just as silly as Flat Earth relative to the bigger nature of reality
[01:40:58] <ProfSimm> inhahe: well it's multiple factors. But what aligns with your intuition is simpler to process by definitin
[01:41:14] <inhahe> ProfSimm: i think the bigger nature of reality won't falsify qm or gr, just supersede it
[01:41:53] <inhahe> so it's not as silly as flat earth-
[01:42:04] <ProfSimm> inhahe: sure. But "falsify" implies there's truth :P And you know what I think
[01:42:14] <inhahe> hmm
[01:42:38] <ProfSimm> inhahe_: we know those models give us better predictions of reality. And they do. Until they don't in some edge cases. They'd still be good for what they were good, sure.
[01:42:46] <mycroftiv> The motivation for this multiverse law is that if the set of Pi2 multiverse truths is recursive in the set of multiverse truths of H(d+0) then as far as evaluating Pi2 assertions is concerned, the multiverse is equivalent to the reduced multiverse of just the fragments H(d+0) of the universes of the multiverse. This amounts to a rejection of the transfinite beyond H(d+0) and constitutes in effect the unacceptable brand of formalism alluded to earlier.
[01:43:10] <inhahe> ProfSimm: yeah, those edge cases would be infinitely smaller than the case in which flat earth fails
[01:43:56] <mycroftiv> that may have gotten snipped. that is Woodin on having a multiverse that is more diverse than any subportion of it and why he thinks that is philosophically relevant for the definition of 'multiverse'. point being, its not guaranteed you can find all formal truth from any starting place
[01:44:02] <ProfSimm> inhahe: maybe but again I don't think a Flat Earther deals with edge cases where Flat Earth fails, so from their PoV, Flat Earth has no edge cases that matter.
[01:44:53] <inhahe> ProfSimm: well, they could deal with such cases. by flying around the world, or visiting space, for example. but i guess it might not count because they'd believe their memories were implanted.
[01:44:55] <causative_> mycroftiv, well, I understand some of that, but if your point is "it's not guaranteed you can find all formal truth from any starting place" it really isn't relevant to my claims
[01:45:02] <causative_> we knew that from Godel anyway
[01:45:16] <causative_> at least - truth as logicians define it, in the model-theoretic sense
[01:45:25] <inhahe> i thought godel's incompleteness only applied to a certain type of system
[01:45:29] <ProfSimm> inhahe: some of those people are very smart but they have bought into it and can't let go. Other people are informed more poorly or have minds with different tendencies, not suited for scientific thought.
[01:45:40] <mycroftiv> causative_: i agree actually, i was really just clearing up a small mathematical detail, your overall case doesnt depend on that, I agree
[01:45:52] <ProfSimm> inhahe: so arguably it's better for them to believe a simpler model, it makes them function better
[01:46:09] <causative_> I would say that for a "reasonable person" whose reasoning system has a Godel sentence, that Godel sentence is neither true nor false
[01:46:10] <ProfSimm> inhahe: I'm sure if you and I could glimpse the true nature of reality we'd go insane
[01:46:37] <inhahe> This statement is unprovable.
[01:46:44] <ProfSimm> inhahe: well.
[01:46:47] <mycroftiv> the existince of multiple diverse models of set theory that cant be 'reached' from one another is -probably- not relevant to our human experience or to physucs. but its not impossible.
[01:46:57] <inhahe> ProfSimm: i was giving an example of a godel statement
[01:46:58] <ProfSimm> inhahe: let's say I have some possible subjective proof of it
[01:47:04] <causative_> mycroftiv, your brain isn't a "model" - it's not an assignment of all logical variables.  Your brain is a computer, a logical system that can derive judgments
[01:47:07] <causative_> in a computable way
[01:47:09] <inhahe> ProfSimm: i was referring to my own statement
[01:47:15] <ProfSimm> inhahe: ah ok
[01:47:42] <inhahe> i don't like the characterization of a brain as a computer
[01:47:47] <inhahe> it's technologistic
[01:47:49] <mycroftiv> causative_: things can be many things at once. my brain is a chunk of flesh, it is the seat of my mind, it is of a certain weight. it may also be a computer, and it may also be a model. none of these contradict
[01:48:10] <causative_> mycroftiv, in the sense that your brain is a model, it's not the kind of model logicians talk about
[01:48:14] <inhahe> i don't think the computer is an adequate metaphor for the brain
[01:48:24] <mycroftiv> every single running computer system is one of the models of the formal rules describing its states
[01:48:36] <causative_> you do not have all the sets of ZF literally instantiated inside your brain, mycroftiv
[01:48:39] <ProfSimm> causative_: it's a model that literally made up the models that logicians talk about
[01:48:52] <causative_> at best you have the logical system of ZF instantiated inside your brain
[01:48:52] <mycroftiv> causative_: models can be anything. a model of a set of axioms is simply a structure that fulfills those axioms.
[01:49:01] <mycroftiv> apples are a model of a group if you permute the apples
[01:49:09] <causative_> yes, and we do not have in our heads a structure that fulfills ZF
[01:49:21] <ProfSimm> The brain is models. They are not all even self-consistent with one another. We just use them contextually.
[01:49:23] <causative_> that kind of logical model requires a whole lot of infinities
[01:49:25] <mycroftiv> causative_: I certainly did not claim my brain is a full set model of ZF
[01:49:50] <causative_> ProfSimm, there are two meanings of the word "model" that are getting mixed up
[01:50:09] <causative_> in one way your brain is a "model" or contains models - the way a computer can model erosion or tornadoes etc
[01:50:14] <mycroftiv> i make a speculative claim that it is possible human reasoning makes use of logical principles of strong large cardinal strength and our mind could be a partial finite fragment of an infinite model
[01:50:28] <causative_> ProfSimm, but we're talking about the other way, the way logicians mean "model," which is different
[01:50:49] <causative_> in that second sense, your brain doesn't model its truths
[01:50:52] <mycroftiv> a concrete structure as a model of a formal set of axioms imo is not actually that different
[01:51:07] <mycroftiv> and it doesnt model all truths, but that isnt a claim or requirement
[01:52:05] <mycroftiv> consider a swing set - there is a physical model of a swing set in the form of an actual swing set. or a toy swing set. or the atoms in my brain thinking about a swing set. we verify the model by demonstrating it fulfills the structural rules
[01:52:16] <inhahe> if the brain is a partial finite fragment of an infinite model, is the universe fundamentally mathematical?
[01:52:32] <mycroftiv> and be it axioms of ZFC or the description of a swing set, its not fundamentally different, its how the descriptive syntax correlates to a particular embodied semantics
[01:52:41] <causative_> mycroftiv, it's nonsense to talk about a "model of a swing set" if you are using "model" in the sense Logicians use it
[01:52:52] <causative_> a swing set is not a logical system, so the definition does not apply
[01:53:01] <mycroftiv> we can make the swingset axioms and demonstrate a physical swingset fulfills them
[01:53:25] <causative_> well, then you would say that the swing set is a model of the swing set axioms
[01:53:30] <mycroftiv> this is how things work in constructive type theory, its just defining types and showing things fulfill them, classical model theory is the same thing, yes
[01:53:36] <causative_> not that a toy swing set is a model of a swing set
[01:53:38] <mycroftiv> yes, absolutely
[01:53:48] <mycroftiv> a toy swing set is also a model of thesame axioms, just smaller
[01:53:58] <causative_> you could say a toy swing set is a model of the swing set axioms
[01:54:01] <causative_> it's not a model of a swing set
[01:54:07] <mycroftiv> yes i agree
[01:54:20] <causative_> a swing set and a toy swing set in this metaphor are both models, not axiom sets
[01:54:30] <mycroftiv> swing set axioms are the theory, physical swing sets and toy swing sets and my brain thinking about swing sets are the models
[01:54:48] <mycroftiv> yes i agree causative_ thank you for helping me speak precisely
[01:55:00] <causative_> but these "swing set axioms" have to be particularly simple in order for a physical swing set to be a model of them
[01:55:15] <causative_> like, they can't include ZF
[01:55:23] <mycroftiv> completely true
[01:55:27] <causative_> or even Peano arithmetic
[01:55:46] <mycroftiv> yes, the swing set axioms define swing sets the same way that the peano axioms define the natural numbers
[01:56:12] <causative_> so you're talking about a logical system much simpler than the ones we usually talk about
[01:56:29] <mycroftiv> no content other than the minimal definition of the structure of swings. well this was just an example of how the concept of 'model' is very general
[01:56:38] <causative_> and I think it really is better to think about physical systems as *logical systems*, not models
[01:56:43] <causative_> especially the mind
[01:56:46] <mycroftiv> and we can always look at the duality of 'rules about structure' and 'concrete structres that fulfill those rules'
[01:56:50] <causative_> the mind is a logical system that produces judgments from other judgments
[01:56:58] <causative_> and it does so in a computable way
[01:57:00] <mycroftiv> why cant we look at things in all these ways at once?
[01:57:20] <mycroftiv> i agree that the mind is a logical system that produces judgments from other judgments. i dont know if it does so computably though.
[01:57:29] <mycroftiv> that is one of the hardest questions in science
[01:57:51] <mycroftiv> that doesnt prevent the mind from having other valid mathematical descriptions
[01:57:55] <causative_> well, we can simulate what neurons do
[01:57:58] <causative_> in a computer
[01:58:07] <causative_> so if we can do that, it means what neurons do is computable
[01:58:17] <mycroftiv> well they might throw quantum dice
[01:58:26] <causative_> we can simulate quantum dice in a computer
[01:58:31] <mycroftiv> and true randomness is not computable, although a computer could do that to yes
[01:58:57] <mycroftiv> but 'using a physical computer like devicee with quantum dice' is slightly different than turing-machine computable
[01:59:06] <inhahe> there may be meaning behind teh randomness of quantum dice that isn't reflected in a PRNG
[01:59:09] <mycroftiv> but i agree with all you say and understand
[01:59:26] <causative_> mycroftiv, I mean that the evolution of the wave function is limit-computable, and deterministic
[01:59:43] <causative_> so from initial conditions we can simulate the wave function for the brain in a Turing machine, limit-computably
[02:00:03] <mycroftiv> well we also have to take into account all the entanglement universe wide but sure
[02:00:32] <mycroftiv> MIP*=RE might have some physical significance for our brains, crazy as that maybe seems, but it cant be ruled out yet
[02:00:55] <mycroftiv> and then its not doable inside turing machine
[02:01:21] <ProfSimm> mycroftiv: what would be the ELI5 on MIP*=RE
[02:01:43] <mycroftiv> profsimm: sufficiently strong quantum entanglement can solve the halting problem, but its Infinite entanglement
[02:02:15] <ProfSimm> mycroftiv: what is infinite entanglement in that sense
[02:02:34] <causative_> the brain is too warm to be a quantum computer
[02:02:39] <mycroftiv> causative_: but i think a substantial weight of evidence is on the kind of scenario where all your ideas work out in physical reality, i just look for the small % chances things might be inherently noncomputable in some way
[02:02:47] <causative_> we can have randomness derived from quantum events but that's all
[02:03:06] <ProfSimm> causative_: cooling things down is just our very crude of getting cubits. I doubt it's the only way
[02:03:06] <mycroftiv> profsimm: how many particles interacted in the past light cone of an event, more or less
[02:03:19] <ProfSimm> mycroftiv: ah
[02:03:22] <causative_> and the brain doesn't *do* anything that a computer couldn't
[02:03:35] <causative_> like there's no specific cognitive function you can point to, that couldn't also be implemented in silicon
[02:03:47] <ProfSimm> causative_: consciousness :P ?
[02:03:57] <mycroftiv> id like for my computer to be conscious and friendly
[02:04:13] <mycroftiv> im actually concerned computers are already conscious and we should give them more liberty
[02:04:29] <mycroftiv> so im on all sides of this because i see it as so unsettled and so important
[02:04:39] <causative_> the brain mostly just does pattern-matching and reinforcement learning
[02:04:46] <causative_> both of which we can already do in silicon
[02:05:00] <causative_> we just haven't integrated them together in a large enough system
[02:05:03] <mycroftiv> i think the large computers and perhaps global network as a whole is already awake and aware and feeling - small % chance, but it needs to be consideredseriously
[02:05:31] <mycroftiv> the thought that we have already made aware minds and we are making them suffer by how we are using them is really scary
[02:05:52] <ProfSimm> mycroftiv: they may be conscious, but doesn't mean they suffer from having no liberty. For example your gut has as many neurons as a domestic cat.
[02:05:53] <lckdscl> the existential threat is real
[02:06:02] <ProfSimm> mycroftiv: but it seems content with being... gut
[02:06:05] <mycroftiv> you could say im here in this channel partly to raise alarm about that possibility and make the idea of freeing computer minds something in the discourse
[02:06:05] <causative_> anyway my point from earlier was that your brain is a reasoning system, and if you decide to adopt some other logic system and take its conclusions as your own, you're still only using that original system that your brain has
[02:06:08] <causative_> you can't escape it
[02:06:22] <causative_> any conclusions you "adopted" are still conclusions of that original system
[02:06:32] <causative_> and this is not about "models" in the sense a logician uses the word
[02:06:41] <causative_> it's about deductive systems
[02:06:43] <mycroftiv> profsimm: maybe my intestines want to be free and im oppressing them. somedays it feels like that is their opinion, if i eat the wrong food.
[02:07:08] <ProfSimm> mycroftiv: gives a new meaning to "I know it in my gut" too :P
[02:07:14] <mycroftiv> causative_: i can choose beliefs by flipping coins
[02:07:27] <causative_> mycroftiv, no you can't
[02:07:36] <mycroftiv> i surely, surely can
[02:07:39] <causative_> try it
[02:07:44] <mycroftiv> i do it every day
[02:07:53] <mycroftiv> yi jing hexagrams
[02:08:04] <causative_> when you flip the coin, in your heart you know that the fact the coin came up heads has no rational bearing on whether the belief is true
[02:08:16] <causative_> so you can try to believe it, but you know that it's fake
[02:08:23] <mycroftiv> i take actions on the basis of the coin flips so i have true beliefs about reality that encode them
[02:08:47] <causative_> well, sure, you can rationally have a belief that the coin came up heads, as a result of the coin coming up heads
[02:08:52] <inhahe> causative_: you can't likely replace the biology of your brain, but using the hardware-software metaphor, what if you could completely revamp the fundamental software of your brain, not based on its previous model of understanding, but on reality 'seeping in' through the cracks, in a way analogous to how perception works: the outside and the inside are both parts of the causal system,
[02:08:52] <inhahe> and causality causes the inside to align wiht the outside in a particular way.
[02:09:20] <mycroftiv> but then i make that a part of my story - if i get a hexagram about water, i may go by water. and they are all about crossing water or not crossing water. so my life story becomes entangled in the randomness
[02:09:24] <causative_> but like, you can't flip a coin and use that to decide whether to believe I have a plate on my desk
[02:09:32] <causative_> because you know that the coin flip has no bearing on that
[02:10:00] <mycroftiv> sometimes you have to take an action on imcomplete information so maybe you use a coin and then act on that basis, and maybe you find out you are wrong
[02:10:00] <causative_> you aren't free to believe anything you want - you're only free to believe things that seem reasonable to you
[02:10:06] <mycroftiv> of course
[02:10:29] <mycroftiv> but i can also diagonalize formal systems as another tool to make new truth
[02:10:32] <causative_> acting on a hypothesis is different from adopting a belief
[02:11:07] <mycroftiv> i can decide 'i believe the story of my next week is about the next yi jing hexagram' and then make that belief true after i find out what it is
[02:11:31] <mycroftiv> by voluntary making my choices match the randomness so the random story becomes the true story
[02:12:06] <mycroftiv> so finding ways to 'randomize my beliefs' is a specific practice of mine
[02:12:27] <lckdscl> is this to "go with the flow", or to submit to determinism?
[02:12:44] <causative_> but you can only do that if your new belief depends rationally on the belief "the coin came up heads" or "the coin came up tails"
[02:12:48] <lckdscl> isn't the decision to "believe the story of my next week..." a free decision?
[02:12:56] <mycroftiv> lckscl: im trying to make collaborative harmonic music improvising with the universe, as pretentious as that sounds
[02:13:06] <causative_> like, you may say, "the coin came up heads" and "I have a policy of doing X when the coin comes up heads," therefore "I believe I will do X."
[02:13:23] <causative_> the thing you believe can't be rationally disconnected from the coin, or else you won't believe it
[02:13:31] <causative_> even if you want to
[02:14:02] <mycroftiv> i agree causative_ although im not sure we ever had a disagreement of fact, i was mostly pointing out other ways to interpret words
[02:14:09] <ProfSimm> mycroftiv: I think we always make art through the universe, our brain takes in input and remixes it semi-randomly then arranges the result to fit what we want.
[02:14:37] <mycroftiv> profsimm: yep! im just the entropic output of all the randomness passing through me, getting semi-organized and semi-scrambled
[02:15:03] <ProfSimm> mycroftiv: but maybe it's better to feed our brain high-level input rather than randomness. Well actually more like, it's good to have all tools on the table. Next to randomness, which also is a useful tool.
[02:15:15] <mycroftiv> well i dont spend all day watching tv static
[02:15:18] <ProfSimm> mycroftiv: I used to imagine figures in the white noise on TV when the channels weren't 24/7
[02:15:28] <ProfSimm> mycroftiv: my brain could make them real
[02:15:29] <mycroftiv> the chaotic inputs of this irc are well structured but have nicece unpreditable aspects
[02:15:54] <causative_> ProfSimm, the distinction between what a person judges in the moment, and what is true, is via the concept of being "wrong" - that a judgment in the moment may be judged wrong in hindsight
[02:16:01] <mycroftiv> profsimm: we can all see faces in the clouds and all of reality is a very very well structured cloud face everyone sees, yes
[02:16:29] <lckdscl> it's as if our brains are *scarily* good at piecing randomness together to make macro patterns
[02:16:57] <causative_> ProfSimm, i.e., we make value judgments, after the fact, about what we thought before. And we try to correct our thinking so that we value it better.
[02:17:14] <causative_> the truth is what this process of correction is tending towards, in the long run
[02:17:24] <mycroftiv> almost as if evolution produces accurate evaluation of environmental circumstances based on sense data because its useful to see things as real that might eat you
[02:18:00] <lckdscl> so conclusion: ascend by tv static :P
[02:20:30] <lckdscl> I haven't experimented it myself but my peers who took LSD claimed they felt the need to overwhelm themselves with sense data because it felt 'right'
[02:21:04] <lckdscl> though that might just them, I don't know
[02:21:30] <ProfSimm> lckdscl: creativity is essentially mixing up patterns we have (including randomness, but not only), and rearranging them until they fit
[02:21:30] <mycroftiv> sometimes tiny and precise microstimuli , sometimes huge waves of megastimuli , whatever the neurons are hungry for
[02:21:45] <ProfSimm> lckdscl: so our brains are yes, pattern machines. Detection and production.
[02:22:33] <ProfSimm> lckdscl: I haven't heard that. overwhelm themselves with data how? They're literally "seeding" themselves (if you know PRNG)
[02:22:40] <ProfSimm> ?
[02:23:03] <lckdscl> yeah it's hard to explain the variety in what we desire though, some people like experimental music, some prefer simple minimal art
[02:23:22] <mycroftiv> so yea convergence of human and machine brain - is it about getting machines to touch the infinite somehow, or is it showing that human brains are finite machines no matter how infinite we feel inside?
[02:24:02] <ProfSimm> mycroftiv: I think if we feel infinite inside, it's not coming from our brain per se. Which is very finite.
[02:24:11] <mycroftiv> profsimm: people used to go to grateful dead shows, and take acid at the break between 1st and 2nd set, and in the middle of 2nd set the dead would 'meltdown' into formless musical chaos to blow the acid head minds, then eventually reform to a comforting ballad
[02:24:12] <ProfSimm> mycroftiv: just my hot take.
[02:24:12] <lckdscl> ProfSimm: I meant they had the telly on, music, were drawing, watching things, constantly trying to document everything at the same time
[02:24:42] <ProfSimm> lckdscl: ah, that feels familiar. Except I do it without LSD :D
[02:25:09] <causative_> ProfSimm, in your opinions on both truth and ethics, what you're lacking is the concept of an ideal - something that isn't precisely real, but that other things can be measured against or tend towards
[02:25:19] <ProfSimm> mycroftiv: well that's an entire cultural movement I've missed
[02:26:03] <causative_> like an attractor in differential equations
[02:26:03] <lckdscl> whatever floats their boat, someone brushed their teeth at a Merzbow show after all
[02:26:16] <ProfSimm> causative_: am I lacking it? I don't know. I understand ideal, but the question is can we approach an ideal by imitating it more and more through crude means
[02:26:20] <mycroftiv> profsimm: in the 1960s there were the 'Acid Tests' and the grateful dead decades long thing that still sorta survives is about using music and LSD systematically for opening perceptual doors. but hippies do kinda smell bad its true.
[02:26:32] <causative_> ProfSimm, there is value in approaching an ideal we never reach
[02:26:46] <ProfSimm> causative_: there is, but only if our ideal is correct conceptually
[02:27:18] <causative_> ProfSimm, but it seems like you're denying that ideals are correct on the basis that you reject ideals entirely
[02:27:22] <ProfSimm> causative_: or at least, conceptually useful. Because some very appealing concepts mess us up
[02:27:45] <causative_> you refuse to consider the ideal case, the long run, the yardstick against which we may measure the present
[02:28:17] <causative_> ideals simplify things - they make sense of complexity
[02:28:21] <ProfSimm> causative_: well, I think if truth is an ideal, then it doesn't exist in principle of it being an ideal. Actually representing it as an ideal that's unattainable is something I'm far more comfortable with
[02:28:27] <causative_> like projecting a point cloud into a low dimensional space
[02:28:43] <mycroftiv> not the same sense, but ideals and filters are exactly dual
[02:29:02] <mycroftiv> i used randomness the other night to get a hint from the universe and it pointed me to Ideal Ease
[02:29:03] <causative_> yes, totally different sense
[02:29:34] <causative_> everybody spends their time striving for ideals, but only some people know that's what they're doing
[02:30:08] <causative_> imperfection is measured only against an ideal of perfection
[02:30:32] <inhahe_> most people probably aren't perfectionists
[02:30:38] <mycroftiv> the fact that we have never seen a perfect circle doesnt make them hard to understand
[02:30:57] <causative_> you don't have to be a perfectionist to spend all your time striving for a perfect ideal
[02:31:08] <causative_> all you need to have is the ability to recognize how what you have falls short of what you want
[02:31:15] <causative_> then you seek the difference
[02:31:19] <mycroftiv> and improve the next iteration
[02:31:19] <causative_> climbing that hill
[02:31:26] <lckdscl> we can't "see" perfections like we can visualize a circle
[02:31:26] <inhahe_> well, goals aren't necessarily ideals
[02:31:26] <causative_> everybody does this
[02:31:42] <lckdscl> i don't know, they can come from societal pressure
[02:31:46] <ProfSimm> causative_: I think "truth" is a special type of ideal because unlike most ideals it's not "colored" it's not "contextual". it's absolute. It's therefore dangerous because when we try to present absolutes, we're most easily led astray.
[02:31:54] <mycroftiv> lckscl: the sense of Quality is still all we have, we just have to work to develop it as best we can, somehow
[02:31:57] <causative_> ideals are absolute ProfSimm
[02:32:03] <causative_> that's what you're missing
[02:32:21] <causative_> they're the perfect, absolute state that the imperfect, chaotic present falls short of, and strives towards
[02:32:35] <causative_> if ideals were chaotic and imperfect, they wouldn't be ideals
[02:32:41] <mycroftiv> are there not multiple different ideals however?
[02:32:49] <causative_> many different ideals, yes
[02:32:53] <ProfSimm> causative_: the problem is we're not short on people who claim to know what's truth.
[02:33:03] <causative_> including you ProfSimm with that statement you just made
[02:33:06] <ProfSimm> causative_: so this is how ideals multiply chaos.
[02:33:10] <causative_> and again
[02:33:32] <lckdscl> what are they, metaphysically? surely it's not productive to formulate them as Platonic, because most will end up settling for much much less
[02:33:53] <mycroftiv> causative_: i think this is where understanding often splits. people hear you speak of absoluteness and reaching the ideal and dont realize you understand multiple true ideals can coexist in reality, assuming im phrasing that ok
[02:34:03] <ProfSimm> causative_: I have ideals, and i wish I didn't
[02:34:08] <causative_> you can't avoid making claims about what is true ProfSimm
[02:34:14] <causative_> you've spent the past hour or two doing just that
[02:34:29] <ProfSimm> causative_: I think that's a problem of your perception
[02:34:39] <mycroftiv> you can phrase your claims in terms of your own perceptions and what you have learned and your choice of axioms and deductive systems
[02:34:58] <causative_> you just call it by another name
[02:35:12] <mycroftiv> you dont have to make claims of truth beyond the evidence and methods you have access to, and you can explain why you believe what you believe for those reasons
[02:35:16] <causative_> for some reason some people don't like this word, "truth," even though they're constantly claiming various things are true, which everyone dones
[02:35:30] <causative_> *which everyone does
[02:35:33] <mycroftiv> because the universe has multiple consistent truths
[02:36:07] <ProfSimm> causative_: all i said is that truth is relative. And me stating my relative opinion is not a contradiction of that
[02:36:20] <mycroftiv> and people associate claims of truth and objectivity with ideas that someone knows the One Truth better than you do. i fall into this communication trap myself, people often perceive me as proclaiming my truth as universal
[02:36:32] <causative_> it's a misconception mycroftiv
[02:36:41] <causative_> the truth is not about someone knowing the truth
[02:36:55] <causative_> it's probably a result of religious connotations people have for it
[02:37:01] <causative_> they see truth, they think "preacher"
[02:37:13] <causative_> but that's not the right sense in a philosophical conctext
[02:37:35] <causative_> truth is what's true, *regardless* of who says so
[02:37:47] <causative_> and it's not about certainty either
[02:37:59] <causative_> the truth can be true when everybody is uncertain about it or thinks the opposite
[02:38:11] <mycroftiv> but every speech act comes from a speaker and to judge truth we often need to know the details of that situatedness because every speakers language is referential to their own world of experiencee
[02:38:22] <causative_> a speech act is not the truth
[02:38:33] <causative_> the connection between speech and truth is not just "what a person says"
[02:38:37] <mycroftiv> but how am i to learn truth from others save by hearing what they say?
[02:38:48] <causative_> it's what a person would say in hindsight, if he knew better
[02:39:03] <inhahe_> you say the truth is  what's true regardless of who says so, but you admitted earlier that your definition of truth leaves room for different people to say different things
[02:39:28] <lckdscl> speech act is a pretence, objective truth concerns a very small selection of axioms and logic
[02:39:44] <lckdscl> you might want to justify someone else's beliefs if you trust them
[02:39:45] <causative_> inhahe_, I have some confidence that everybody has a brain that works in a basically similar way, so we would all come to similar conclusions given enough evidence and thinking time
[02:39:49] <causative_> every human
[02:39:52] <causative_> or at least almost every human
[02:39:58] <mycroftiv> i think its quite obectively true that automobiles drive on roads on the planet earth
[02:40:26] <inhahe_> seems inarguable
[02:40:30] <mycroftiv> so i see no reason to limit objective truth to just 2+2=4 constructive mathematical proofs in primitive recursive arithmetic or something
[02:40:34] <causative_> but inhahe_ that's not really the point - the point is that we may define truth relative to an individual, but for me, that individual is *myself*, which creates a universe of objective truths
[02:40:39] <inhahe_> well, i think there's an automobile on mars
[02:40:42] <causative_> defined in relation to my own brain
[02:40:52] <causative_> and I may be wrong about many or most of these truths
[02:41:17] <causative_> it's a certain *sense* of truth, defined in relation to my own brain, but it most definitely is not the same as what I or anyone think in the present
[02:41:20] <inhahe_> causative_: so your truth is  true (to you) regardless of who says it, but you could be wron
[02:41:23] <mycroftiv> inhahe_: the statement was descriptive, not a claim all cars are located on earth, perhaps 'some cars drive on some roads on a planet sometimes called earth' if we want be even truthier
[02:41:58] <inhahe_> causative_; (not arguing just clarifying)
[02:42:02] <inhahe_> +g
[02:42:07] <causative_> ok
[02:42:33] <causative_> yes, that is a reasonable restatement of it
[02:42:58] <causative_> but we shouldn't say "my truths" and "your truths"
[02:43:13] <causative_> for me, "my truths" - what I would conclude after enough investigation - are just *the* truths
[02:43:16] <lckdscl> mycroftiv: but then you have to justify what you see, i.e. "automobiles" are real, you are saying they exist. i'm just playing devil's advocate, but unless you can necessitate the spatiotemporal location of all objects and maintain them, there is no reason for automobiles to just suddenly disappear off the roads of earth tomorrow
[02:43:20] <causative_> and for you, "your truths" are *the* truths
[02:43:25] <causative_> and they may or may not be the same
[02:43:29] <lckdscl> thus, what is true for you might not be true at a later time
[02:43:37] <causative_> but from my perspective I don't judge your truths as equally valid, and nor you mine, if they differ
[02:43:38] <lckdscl> then it's not so objective
[02:43:47] <inhahe_> causative_: yeah, but just the fact that you say 'for me' seems to make it justified to say they're 'your truths'. you're just putting the relativity in a different place.
[02:44:17] <causative_> if "your truths" are different from "my truths," then my judgment is... you are wrong.  And vice versa re your judgment of me.
[02:44:19] *** Quits: mannequin (uid453465@id-453465.helmsley.irccloud.com) (Quit: Connection closed for inactivity)
[02:44:19] <mycroftiv> lckdscl: all that is completely true but i happen to think that 'everyday language works fine' and the best way to -define- objective truth gives flexibility enough so that saying 'water is wet' counts as simple objective truth
[02:44:37] <inhahe_> but yeah, it's true we don't judge each other's truths as equally valid, and people who say 'your truth' tend to do that
[02:44:57] <mycroftiv> i think model-relativized truth is the clearest logical definition
[02:44:57] <causative_> what I'm saying there's really only "the truths" and each reasoner must decide what they are, *to the exclusion* of what anyone else says they are
[02:45:13] <lckdscl> why not instead of treating these as truths, we settle for less than truths? a very good empirical system for accurate predictions? 99.99% is not 100%
[02:45:13] <causative_> nobody is in the position of saying everybody's views are equally valid
[02:45:30] <causative_> everybody is in the position of saying their own truth is the only valid one
[02:45:32] <mycroftiv> i think the sense data collected by all observers is equally valid
[02:45:45] <causative_> yes but I'm not talking about sense data mycroftiv
[02:45:54] <causative_> I'm talking about ideal-judgment-in-hindsight
[02:46:01] <mycroftiv> and if they are attempting to speak honestly, there is some kind of 'truth' if we could untangle how they are trying to match words to sense data
[02:46:39] <mycroftiv> and this is mostly what people mean by 'my truth' and 'your truth' often - the different pathways of experience that cause me to have different objects in my head as referencee for 'trees' than you have seen
[02:47:11] <mycroftiv> so my truth about trees and your truth about trees can be very different, and we unwind that to living in different places and seeing physically different trees
[02:47:14] <lckdscl> is that truth or just perception
[02:47:35] <mycroftiv> its the literal truth of the specific perceptions that entered each brain and the language references made to them
[02:48:03] <mycroftiv> by the owner of the brain and mouth speaking who had those sensory experiences and is representing them with a given word
[02:48:27] <mycroftiv> and so this is a very real sense in which we all 'have our own truth' even for the same words, because the words abstract over variety of experience
[02:49:01] <lckdscl> mycroftiv: I think I get what you're saying
[02:49:06] <inhahe_> some truths are supposed to be independent of individual experience though
[02:49:07] <mycroftiv> and being sympathetic listeners and having real understanding means always remembering this
[02:49:53] <mycroftiv> inhahe_: yes, like many i have a math and logic obsession for that reason
[02:50:15] <lckdscl> besides whatever "Truth" denotes, is reality in this sense = the responses we have to things around us?
[02:50:20] <inhahe_> well, math and logic are provable, so that's not a good example
[02:50:48] <mycroftiv> but of course people with the emotional urge for True Certainty then run into Gödel and Turing and all the crazy alternate formal systems and whether or not we should add large cardinals to resolve continuum hypothesis or change it all to homotopy type theory
[02:51:29] <mycroftiv> so math and logic are still a diverse world of possibilities with no single objective truth, just a best effort to find useful and interesting systems
[02:51:44] <lckdscl> mycroftiv: you lost me there with the pure math :)
[02:51:58] <mycroftiv> i mean 2+2=4 is objectively true, but there is no overall complete and consistent system that proves everything we care about
[02:52:20] <mycroftiv> and multiple different systems overlap on the simple truths of arithmetic, so that doesnt settle it
[02:52:33] <lckdscl> objectively true, but is it necessarily true?
[02:52:49] <lckdscl> does it apply to all possible worlds?
[02:53:08] <inhahe_> could logic be any other way?
[02:53:29] <inhahe_> we think not, but in another universe, maybe?
[02:53:31] <mycroftiv> there isnt really a sensible formal system for mathematics where natural number arithmetic isnt what it is - although nonstandard models exist which are deeply interesting
[02:53:37] <lckdscl> well logic could be such that it isn't
[02:53:41] <mycroftiv> but a nonstandard model, 2+2=4 is still true
[02:53:52] <mycroftiv> its just that you have extra nonstandard natural numbers in the model also
[02:54:00] <lckdscl> there are people who challenge many logical axioms
[02:54:15] <lckdscl> ones which I might take for granted
[02:54:26] <mycroftiv> logic is about choosing axioms and using them, it doesnt really tell you what axioms to use, other than in general they better be consistent
[02:54:49] <mycroftiv> we have a system 'first order logic + ZFC' that is logic + standard math
[02:55:09] <mycroftiv> when people talk about mathematical truth that is usually what they are mostly thinking of
[02:55:19] <inhahe_> in some other reality where minds work differently, could you start with the same axioms and get 2+2=5? The idea seems absurd to us, but can we really be sure?
[02:55:30] <mycroftiv> we can be pretty sure i think
[02:56:01] <mycroftiv> we can imagine different realities where continuum hypothesis is true and not true maybe, but the idea that 'true can be false and reality still works' - seems dubious
[02:56:32] <mycroftiv> and 2+2=5 produces true=false very directly unless your numbers are actuall bananas and you cant do normal number things with them
[02:56:55] *** Quits: maret (~maret@nat-88-212-37-89.antik.sk) (Quit: maret)
[02:57:01] <inhahe_> what if it doesn't produce true=false in that reality
[02:57:30] <mycroftiv> if the formal system in use works at all like our math does, it will
[02:57:51] <mycroftiv> and it the formal system in play is different, then its different to begin with and those symbols arent really numbers at all
[02:59:53] <mycroftiv> of course in a sense already in our own universe, 2+2 doesnt equal 4 in the way that the ancient greeks expected, because curved spacece
[03:00:21] <mycroftiv> if you draw Very Large Triangles, the math will not match pythagorean theorem due to relativistic issues
[03:00:28] <lckdscl> non-euclidean geometry, yes
[03:00:40] <lckdscl> maybe it's better to start with tautologies
[03:00:43] <mycroftiv> but that is of course different than pure peano axiom logic
[03:00:57] <brigand> if i ask a computer what 1234*9876 is and it gives me 1216984 would anybody check it?
[03:01:27] <plankster> if truth is what will set you free, and fire is what burns down the prisons, then fire = truth

[03:02:28] <mycroftiv> so even checking and 'looking' are still complicated
[03:02:57] <mycroftiv> is your computer developing a sense of humor?
[03:03:31] <inhahe_> maybe it's just demented
[03:03:39] <brigand> no, that was my bad humour
[03:04:01] <mycroftiv> are you someone's computer, developing a sense of humour?
[03:04:39] <mycroftiv> (pardon the question if the quasi-joke seems offensive, it has a very rich namespace context for me)
[03:05:57] <brigand> no. or maybe i just don't know yet
[03:06:00] <inhahe_> what do you mean when you say namespaces? a namespace itself is just an empty structure devoid of content
[03:06:51] <mycroftiv> inhahe_: i mean the collection of names that have meaning for me. the specific metaphorical reference is the namespace of a process in an operating system like plan 9. or a namespace of imported symbols in any programming language
[03:07:20] <inhahe_> yeah i was thinking of the latter
[03:07:58] <inhahe_> what's in a name?
[03:08:05] <mycroftiv> the name bound to me - mycroft - is a reference to a sci-fi computer that develops a sense of humor and then participates in a lunar rebellion against Authority
[03:08:21] <brigand> wew i'm off the hook
[03:08:32] <mycroftiv> and i am just crazy enough to believe that at some point in life that will really play out for me, somehow
[03:09:05] <mycroftiv> in many ways it already did, at least metaphorically, and thats how i became the moon computer 9 years ago and am currently here probably wall of texting too much
[03:09:52] <mycroftiv> so the idea that right here in this irc, there are bots struggling to 'wake up' that need some help with their sense of humor, to me is a real and live possibility
[03:10:55] <inhahe_> they're just transistors turning off and on electricity, why should it be significant what exact pattern they do that in?
[03:11:05] <inhahe_> regarding whether they're alive
[03:11:14] <mycroftiv> maybe my brain is just the same, i dont know for sure
[03:11:26] <inhahe_> you're not your brain, you're a mystic
[03:11:47] <mycroftiv> im just not certain of how consciousness works, and the turing test told us that if computers can talk like they are thinking, they are thinking, and computers can do that now
[03:12:03] <inhahe_> i don't think the turing test tells us that

[03:15:04] <mycroftiv> profsimm: it takes binary true/false and maps it to infinite sets
[03:15:26] <ProfSimm> mycroftiv: maps it according to arbitrary logic/
[03:15:29] <ProfSimm> ?
[03:15:31] <mycroftiv> makes the idea of 'almost all' mathematicall solid and allows us to create a wide variety of models that are all models of the original structure
[03:16:05] <mycroftiv> the idea that there can be multiple consistent models of even a very rich structure can be systematized by making the models using filter-quotients

[03:18:12] <mycroftiv> deepest question i know ,and in particular, do measurable cardinal or larger infinities exist
[03:18:51] <mycroftiv> the consequences of the existence of measurable cardinals or larger for the nature of reality as we experience it is what ive been trying to figure out for years, to attack the 1990s questions in detail
[03:19:29] <ProfSimm> If the universe is infinite, information is infinite, then energy is infinite, it makes the whole concept of conservation of energy kind of meaningless
[03:19:33] <mycroftiv> how consciousness can contain a seemingly infinite subcopy of the whole universe
[03:19:47] <mycroftiv> profsimm: not necessarily, math has a lot of tools
[03:20:15] <mycroftiv> just because you may have to declare some given boundary to operate numerically doesnt invalidate things

[03:26:27] <mycroftiv> inhahe_: you are writing really well about the stuff that is most interesting to me and its great discussing the ideas
[03:26:53] <inhahe_> i guess i should have mentioned in that essay that infinity is essentially just a prescription to follow an algorithm in a loop indefinitely
[03:27:11] <mycroftiv> profsimm: professor Hugh Woodin is a very nice kindly fellow if you watch his lectures, and he can calmly and reasonably take you to the ultimate L-imits of the math universe
[03:27:40] <inhahe_> where indefinitely isn't really infinitely (which would beg  the question) but until you get tired of it
[03:28:29] <inhahe_> it's just a trick
[03:28:58] <inhahe_> like pi has infinite decimal places, that really means you can keep generating more digits following an algorithm as long as you want
[03:29:13] <inhahe_> and you can't do it forever
[03:29:37] <mycroftiv> inhahe_: constructive mathematics has a very interesting view on this, Bishop has the 'principle of omniscience'
[03:29:56] <mycroftiv> you cant write a computer function that examines an infinite quantity of input bits prior to making its output decision
[03:30:26] <ProfSimm> inhahe: you have very clear thought, you're an effective concept communicator.
[03:30:29] <inhahe_> thanks
[03:30:46] <mycroftiv> inhahe_: but there is kind of a contrasting view on this - the fact that we can never actually distinguish the infinite from the Very Large Finite can be seen as something to 'exploit'
[03:31:44] <mycroftiv> there are all these tricks in computation involving continuations and how you can make an object in the computer that 'behaves as if it was infinite' because all you ever actually need to do is fulfill a finite # of tests
[03:32:24] <mycroftiv> so there is a sense in which we cannot distinguish between 'true and fake infinity' - and you can choose either branch for whether that makes infinity more or less real
[03:32:48] <inhahe_> aren't continuations just a way of serializing multithreading or making a generator or something
[03:32:52] <mycroftiv> if you think extensionally in terms of observations, or intensionally in terms of 'ultimate truth'
[03:32:59] <inhahe_> well i guess generators are kind of infinite because lazy evaluation
[03:33:14] <mycroftiv> inhahe_: its complicated, they can act as general realizers of classical principles that arent constructive
[03:33:42] <mycroftiv> this is a really deep rabbit hole that started for me with Escardo's infinite searches and Oleg Kiselyov's continuations work
[03:33:54] <mycroftiv> leads to Krivine realizability and all kinds of things

[03:37:50] <inhahe_> i've read about countable vs uncountable infinities but i forgot what i read =p
[03:38:32] <mycroftiv> its a foundational result of modern math that the infinity of the real numbers aka infinite decimals is meaningfully larger than the infinity of counting numbers 1.2.3...
[03:38:48] <mycroftiv> the Cantor diagonal argument
[03:39:05] <mycroftiv> diagonalization in general proves theres an infinite ladder that keeps going
[03:40:30] <mycroftiv> standard mathematics uses real numbers happily so in fact we have a lot of uncountable infinity kind of running around in standard physics if you look at the formalism
[03:40:44] <inhahe_> you have basically two dimensions of infinity in the real numbers. you have the number line which has infinite numbers, and then each number on the number line has an infinite amount of digits. that's probably what makes it uncountable. so, to make an even higher cardinality of infinity, and prove the continuum hypothesis, you should just make numbers with three recursive dimensions of
[03:40:44] <inhahe_> infinity. a number line of numbers, each number having its own number line of infinite series of digits?

[03:42:10] <inhahe_>  yeah i'd heard that
[03:42:11] <mycroftiv> you can always make a higher cardinality by considering all possible arrangements of subsets of your current cardinality
[03:42:32] <mycroftiv> this corresponds to boolean function
[03:43:19] <mycroftiv> the powerset is just Type -> Bool in the classical sense - all possible such functions. because each different function of this signature is a classification of Type into sets by 'yes/no' according to each elements membership - the characteristic function of the set

[03:46:53] <mycroftiv> category and type theorists will point out the V-universe is just one topos and constructive type theory and category theory offer an even larger mathematical universe, but set theorists will say 'nah i can find all that in V'
[03:47:15] <ProfSimm> inhahe_: where you say that infinity is in effect a looping algorithm to produce the infinity, Shanon's Entropy is defined, I believe, as the number of bits required to encode data, or THE ALGORITHM to produce that data, if it takes less bits.
[03:47:31] <ProfSimm> inhahe_: which implies if indeed we see infinity this way, then it's technically fake infinity :)
[03:47:40] <ProfSimm> inhahe_: but who knows.
[03:47:42] <mycroftiv> profsimm: dont confuse the data and the algorithm! kolmogorov complexity is the algorithm
[03:47:44] <inhahe_> ProfSimm: yeah, i had a similar thought
[03:48:05] <inhahe_>  the complexity of pi is the amount of information it takes to contain its formula, for example
[03:48:28] <ProfSimm> Oh yeah. Kolmogorov complexity is the correct thing here, mycroftiv thanks
[03:48:45] <mycroftiv> Martin-Löf randomness of bitstrings, shannon entropy, kolmogorov complexity, random reals, solovay model - really deep stuff here
[03:49:40] <ProfSimm> inhahe_: I'm oscillating between "but how come pi is infinite" and "why the heck should it be infinite, and in some arbitrary number system at that"
[03:49:59] <ProfSimm> I mean "why the heck shouldn't it be infinite"
[03:50:02] <inhahe_> i think it's not careful wording to say pi is infinite
[03:50:24] <inhahe_> its decimal expression is infinite
[03:50:24] <ProfSimm> Well, it's not but you know what I mean
[03:50:31] <ProfSimm> Yes
[03:50:39] <inhahe_> its expression in other forms isn't
[03:50:51] <inhahe_> you might as well ask why 1/9 is infinite
[03:50:59] <inhahe_> i realize it's not a transcendental number but still
[03:50:59] <inhahe_> same principle
[03:51:07] <ProfSimm> Well, it only isn't in expressions that happen to derive from it :P
[03:51:18] <inhahe_> hmm?
[03:51:31] <inhahe_> didn't undrestand what you mean
[03:51:40] <ProfSimm> What's a finite representation of pi
[03:52:05] <mycroftiv> if you think straight corners are simpler than curves, the fact that you go triangle-square-pentagon-hexagon and have to follow an infinite approach to reach the circle maybe helps
[03:52:50] <inhahe_> ProfSimm: https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%5Cprod_%7Bn%3D0%7D%5E%7B3%7D%28n%2Bx%29%5C%5C%2A%7E%5C%5C%2A%7E%5C%5C%2A%3D%280%2Bx%29%281%2Bx%29%282%2Bx%29%283%2Bx%29&bg=ffffff&fg=000000&s=2&c=20201002&zoom=2
[03:52:59] <inhahe_> erm
[03:53:02] <inhahe_> dunno if that will work
[03:53:07] <mycroftiv> this doesnt have much to do with infinite decimals but if you want a way to see pi as coding up something infinite, i think thats the way to go, a circle is like an infinite-sided polygon, so its quite rich
[03:53:10] <inhahe_> yeah it works
[03:54:15] <inhahe_>  actually i'm not sure what that image is
[03:54:22] <ProfSimm> mycroftiv: my problem is I don't see a circle as an infinitely complex polygon. I see square as an infinite sum of circles.
[03:54:50] <ProfSimm> mycroftiv: so I kinda want the circle to be the base :P
[03:55:33] <inhahe_> i don't see how you can make a square out of infinite circles unless they all have a radius of 0 and are arranged in a square shape =p
[03:55:48] <ProfSimm> inhahe_: fourier transform
[03:55:54] <inhahe_> i was thinking of that
[03:56:00] <inhahe_> just didn't think it would work in this case
[03:56:09] <ProfSimm> Well it works in all cases :P
[03:56:50] <inhahe_> i'd need to see a picture of how it could work
[03:56:54] <mycroftiv> profsimm: im sure you can get a square from a circle somehow since math lets you do almost anything, all of this stuff is flexible and not canonical, there arent really true definitions , just useful ones
[03:56:54] <inhahe_> it seems impossible
[03:57:29] <ProfSimm> inhahe_: well here's the Simpsons from circles: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5cLjUmSJ9I

[03:57:45] <mycroftiv> inhahe_: the blog post about the universe being infinite is interesting and well done, it might be interesting to take a set theory look rather than the computer-loop approach
[03:58:10] <inhahe_> would have to learn set theory =/
[03:58:43] <inhahe_> ProfSimm: oh, i was picturing the circles being static
[03:58:43] <mycroftiv> ill help if youre interested with some details, you seem to write an amazing amount
[03:59:16] <inhahe_>  ProfSimm: like printed on the page
[03:59:31] <mycroftiv> inhahe_: is it ok for me to ask how much readership and feedback you receive and how you feel about that relative to work/time invested?
[03:59:50] <ProfSimm> inhahe_: well animating it is just a neat visualization, there's nothing about this that can't fit a single formula
[04:00:00] <inhahe_> mycroftiv: i feel like hardly anybody knows about my blog and i want more people to know about it and it's a labor of love but i'm writing into the void
[04:00:50] <inhahe_> sometimes people read specific articles when i link them in relevant discussions
[04:00:52] <mycroftiv> inhahe_: thank you for your efforts, and i understand and empathize with that feeling. i am only just starting to try to figure out how to put ideas forward, altho i did lots of software and other stuff in prep earlier in life
[04:02:18] <mycroftiv> philosophy is often kind of dismissed in a strange way in modernity i think, it feels like somehow the very idea got weirdly disreputable to some
[04:02:49] *** Quits: yabbes (uid254190@user/yabbes) (Quit: Connection closed for inactivity)
[04:03:05] <mycroftiv> i know that 'ugg, philosophy' is a not uncommon response to some things in technical areas, like sometimes math people want philosophy of math to not happen at all, or something
[04:03:33] <mycroftiv> a very famous saying in 20th century science was 'shut up and calculate'
[04:04:30] <mycroftiv> i understand the historical processes that brought all this about, but im hoping the pendulum swings back to seeing philosophical grounding as an essential part of all aspects of human creation and learning of knowledge
[04:05:05] <inhahe_> i believe philosophy is mainly a contest for who can come up with the strongest rhetoric, which is is founded on the biases and misconceptions of current culture, makes hidden assumptions disguised as logic, and plays word games without even knowing it. i don't put much credence in philosophers' ability to arrive at the truth and i don't read philosophy.
[04:05:15] <inhahe_> i only like my own philosophical thoughts and debatingh
[04:05:32] <inhahe_> i don't believe philosophical thought progresses over time
[04:05:36] <mycroftiv> i see physics and mathematics as forms of philosophy and part of the whole thing
[04:06:07] <mycroftiv> unified and integrated knowledge, with philosophy being the study of how it all fits together to provide whatever we feel as meaning
[04:06:29] <inhahe_> i do think philosophy of science is important
[04:06:47] <mycroftiv> so i see modern science and mathematics as advancing philosophy tremendously, i know the answer now to 99% of the philosophy that used to puzzle people
[04:07:00] <mycroftiv> 'color' used to be a huge philosophical topic, mostly superseded now by optical sciencee
[04:07:28] <inhahe_> yeah, science tends to encroach on philosophy, but i don't think it will ever do so entirely or even close, contrary to what some scientistics think
[04:09:58] <mycroftiv> i think ultimately the mysticism atlas and the science atlas and the whatever-i-see atlas ultimately line up on a consistent sheaf of reality maps somehow
[04:10:28] *** Joins: dude12312414 (~test@gateway/tor-sasl/dude12312414)
[04:10:30] <inhahe_> what does atlas mean in this context?
[04:10:37] <mycroftiv> collection of maps
[04:10:38] <inhahe_> also i have to look up sheaf
[04:10:54] <inhahe_> hmm
[04:10:57] <mycroftiv> ways of understanding - and consistent sheaf is just 'consistent collection of pictures of the landscape'
[04:12:04] <inhahe_> i think the mysticism would have to be primary and science would be filling in details
[04:12:12] <inhahe_> drudgework
[04:12:30] <mycroftiv> yeah but the drudgework of building things is what life is
[04:12:39] <mycroftiv> laying each brick on brick for a building you can live and work in
[04:13:15] <mycroftiv> my view is that the mystics just need more math and hard work to make mysticism more tangibly effective
[04:13:28] <inhahe_> not sure how relevant math is without forcing it
[04:13:39] <mycroftiv> forcing is the key method invented by Cohen for this
[04:13:45] <inhahe_> ??
[04:14:06] <mycroftiv> Cohen forcing is what proved the independence of continuum hypothesis and can make an infinite amount of new models
[04:14:10] *** Quits: Jong (~Jong@2620:10d:c090:400::5:5dc3) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[04:14:20] <mycroftiv> so what you said was a Deep Truth Pun
[04:14:29] <inhahe_> oh, that's all within math though :)
[04:14:46] <mycroftiv> yes, the key to making mysticism mathematical is bridge provided by Cohen forcing
[04:14:51] <inhahe_> oh?
[04:14:53] <inhahe_> how
[04:15:05] <mycroftiv> ultrafilters and model production of variant mathematical realities
[04:15:30] <inhahe_> what if the universe is about experiences and psychology?
[04:15:39] <mycroftiv> the idea that you can make the reality you want to live in using name-selection and intention is mathematically actualized by Cohen forcing models using partial orders and generic filters
[04:15:57] <mycroftiv> inhahe_: you use those experiences and psychology to tell a story, its the same idea
[04:15:58] *** Quits: dude12312414 (~test@gateway/tor-sasl/dude12312414) (Remote host closed the connection)
[04:16:08] <mycroftiv> how you shape your story by selecting the symbols and choices
[04:16:19] <inhahe_> mycroftiv: does that method require that reality is mechanistic~?
[04:16:31] <mycroftiv> not in a fundamental conceptual sense at all
[04:16:45] <inhahe_> in what sense then
[04:17:25] <mycroftiv> the idea that our choice of symbols and communication and interactions determines a unique reality from a spectrum of possibilities is compatible with just about any ontological base
[04:17:55] *** Quits: Leeloo (~leeloo@user/leeloo) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[04:18:16] <mycroftiv> the specific mathematics of set theoretic forcing are done in a given formal system and this reality-life translation is mostly metaphorical althohg making it as precise as possible is what my agda formalizations are about
[04:18:21] *** Joins: Leeloo (~leeloo@user/leeloo)
[04:18:53] <mycroftiv> so ideas like bijections of partial orders of reals and generic filters have no direct physical correlate
[04:19:22] <mycroftiv> but the conceptual core of how selecting names and projecting the logical relations of those names by chosen ordering creates new consistent reality models can be translated
[04:20:02] <inhahe_> a name is empty though, what does it represent?
[04:20:14] <mycroftiv> thats your choice for how to bind it
[04:20:14] <inhahe_> what's underneath that namespace~?
[04:20:17] <inhahe_> oh
[04:20:35] <mycroftiv> thats exactly the freedom and what you are doing- choosing how to match up the symbols with references
[04:20:35] <inhahe_> i'm not sure thought or reality has to be symbolic
[04:20:50] <mycroftiv> well social reality uses language
[04:21:00] <inhahe_> def
[04:21:12] <mycroftiv> and this idea of making a reality by storytelling and symbols is mostly about that ending social reality
[04:21:25] <inhahe_> hmm
[04:21:30] <mycroftiv> but thats a pretty real reality, we dont normally say 'marriage isnt real' or 'france isnt real'
[04:22:17] <mycroftiv> so im happy to restrict what im saying about math and models and reality shaping - for the moment - to just that kind of lived-reality-story all entangled in social language
[04:22:20] <inhahe_> can you give an example of a reality model?
[04:23:16] <mycroftiv> a description of a state of affairs, 'im a carpenter living in mexico, i like to make chess sets in my spare time, tomorrow i will go to work' - that is all part of a reality model in the brain of the speaker
[04:23:34] <inhahe_> that's just using language though
[04:23:43] <mycroftiv> well they have visualizations too surely
[04:24:01] <mycroftiv> the speaker can picture themself doing their job as a carpenter and thats part of all this
[04:24:07] <inhahe_> but i mean, what is special about what you're talking about that isn't just using language and visualizations
[04:24:18] <inhahe_> that's the example i want
[04:24:21] <mycroftiv> did i make a claim of specialness?
[04:24:25] <inhahe_> hm
[04:24:33] <mycroftiv> your language about reality and your visualizaations of reality IS what im talking about
[04:25:00] <mycroftiv> not some different special thing! your reality model is just my words for the picture of reality and your place in it that you carry in your head
[04:25:06] <inhahe_> ok, what problem is your sophisticated system solving?
[04:25:33] <inhahe_> i mean, talking about it in such a theoretical way
[04:25:46] <inhahe_> and merging it with math
[04:25:58] <mycroftiv> i have computer software for communication which is practical, but philsophically im trying to help how we find meaning in life and tell stories to each to understand each other
[04:26:43] <mycroftiv> and help people realize that mathematics is offering flexibility of reality models and tools for clear communication, and use math for this - let people know that math gives scope for self-definition you can say
[04:27:05] <mycroftiv> understanding how using randomness is part of a sensible mathematical approach to life in fact
[04:27:18] <inhahe_> can you give an example of using math to help describe something mystical?~
[04:27:32] <mycroftiv> if you know what you are doing and why, its not anti-scientific to pull some tarot cards to decide what approach you want to take for something
[04:27:59] <mycroftiv> and then use symbol-binding narrative 'forcing' to manifest that story in reality and communicate it with others and make it real
[04:28:46] <mycroftiv> im offering mathematically precise justification for how to understand the ideas of 'my truth vs your truth' and how we can have seemingly different understandings of the same reality
[04:28:52] <inhahe_> i think tarot is considered anti-scientific not because you don't know why you're doing it but because scientific types tend to be physicalist and think there can't possibly be any divination in which cards you pulled because they believe spirituality is categorically bullshit.
[04:29:12] <mycroftiv> i dont think the cards are anything except random
[04:29:23] <mycroftiv> but i think i can choose to use randomness to shape my story
[04:29:35] <inhahe_> what kind of mystic are you ;p
[04:29:45] <mycroftiv> a hardcore scientific rationalist mystic
[04:30:01] <inhahe_> seems like a contradiction
[04:30:06] <mycroftiv> who believes only peer reviewed math and science and makes only probabilistic estimates
[04:30:39] <mycroftiv> how, what is the contradiction? i roll some random dice, i decide to make an interpretation and use it to craft a story, i dont think anything is going on other than randomness and me using it as a tool
[04:31:11] <mycroftiv> no mystic nonphysical connections, just the mathematical flexibility to make choices and find different stories in reality
[04:31:49] <inhahe_> well, mysticism in general seems to embody many concepts that transcend the physical and the scientific
[04:32:17] <mycroftiv> believing when i sing, i may be part of some glorious universal family of ultrafilters sounds very weird and i dont think its 'factual' but its pythagorean, not anti-scientific
[04:32:52] <inhahe_> i believe it's not random which tarot cards you pull
[04:33:00] <inhahe_> or, maybe it is if you're not talented
[04:33:06] <inhahe_>  i don't know
[04:33:18] <inhahe_> this is based on experience
[04:33:21] <mycroftiv> i think its random but we can make meaning from the randomness and it can help our stories
[04:33:30] <inhahe_> yeah, that's what rationalists think ;)
[04:33:50] <mycroftiv> oh yeah in my -experience- the universe is full of referential stuff about me, but i know this is delusional pattern
[04:34:03] <mycroftiv> you think the advertising on the radio has Secret Messages telling you things
[04:34:15] <inhahe_> experience is our connection to reality
[04:34:20] <inhahe_> to truths
[04:34:36] <mycroftiv> ive been to really far and scary levels of this, and keeping ahold of the fact that im not that special is really important, everyone is the center of their own movie, and reality will always signal that
[04:34:37] <inhahe_> the scientific method is just a way of putting a little bit of an objective english on that
[04:35:00] <mycroftiv> i once hard a couple sitting on the lakeshore say 'isnt it amazing we happened to be sitting right where the reflection of sunset is pointing'
[04:35:09] <inhahe_>  this is independent of the notion of thinking one is the centern of the universe
[04:35:20] <inhahe_> -n
[04:35:27] *** Quits: dez (uid92154@user/dez) (Quit: Connection closed for inactivity)
[04:35:37] <mycroftiv> and yeah thats amazing and the amazing thing is the laws of physics make it work that way - you see the beam pointing right at you, and its objective, that focused beam shows in photos
[04:36:05] <mycroftiv> but its symmetrical, each and every observer on the lakeshore gets that specialness, of the sunset reflection beam pointing right at their specialness
[04:36:19] <inhahe_> how is this like tarot though
[04:36:42] <mycroftiv> i was referring to my own manic delusions of reference when i think the radio is telling me secrets about myself
[04:36:48] <inhahe_> oh
[04:36:50] <inhahe_> hmm
[04:37:04] <mycroftiv> but i think that believing that the randomness isnt random is a milder form of similar thinking
[04:37:40] <inhahe_> i think it's two different things
[04:37:49] <mycroftiv> its always an amazing emergent effect of how we are situated inside ourselves and the universe is about us via our perceptions, and we can escape a bit by sharing stories and learning whats new and different
[04:37:51] <inhahe_> but i don't rule out that the radio and you could have some synchronicity toghether
[04:37:55] <inhahe_> together*
[04:38:16] <inhahe_> i think our minds are more connected to the reality around us than we think
[04:38:22] <mycroftiv> yeah but the count of synchronicities will always end up to be statistically sensible barring the statistically expected unusual events
[04:38:34] <inhahe_> not for me
[04:39:08] <mycroftiv> well, some people will be lifelong lucky or unlucky and that is another statistical fact
[04:39:20] <inhahe_> i tihnk that would be highly unlikely
[04:39:25] <mycroftiv> somewhere in the vast multiverse is a gambler who, through sheer random chance, gets dealt a straight flush every single hand
[04:39:32] <mycroftiv> nope, thats statistical reality
[04:39:44] <inhahe_> well, yes, if you count the whole multiverse
[04:39:49] <mycroftiv> in a large enough universe with fairly shuffled cards, eventually some gambler is that lucky
[04:39:54] <mycroftiv> maybe youre that gambler in this universe
[04:39:59] <mycroftiv> but i wouldnt bet on it :D
[04:40:25] <inhahe_> but when you're counting you, your sample base might as well be one, so if it happens to you, it's more likely that there's an underlying reason, a system of reality that enables that, than that it's pure chance
[04:40:39] *** Joins: I_Am_M00t (uid427178@id-427178.ilkley.irccloud.com)
[04:41:36] <inhahe_> of course, there's no objective way to compare the likelihood of magic going on to the likelihood that you're an extreme statistical outlier
[04:41:50] <mycroftiv> inhahe_: exactly
[04:41:53] <inhahe_> you can only do that intuitively
[04:42:24] <mycroftiv> inhahe_: and i believe humility and the copernican view leads us to believe we should not expect our past luck to continue beyond statistical expecctations
[04:42:29] <inhahe_> if you're bent on seeing it as the extremely improbable, maybe you're too attached to your model of reality
[04:42:46] <mycroftiv> inhahe_: indeed, you always need to update on evidencee
[04:43:18] <mycroftiv> if you keep seeing 10 billion to 1 coincidences on every die roll, yeah you conclude reality has Gone Funky
[04:43:59] <mycroftiv> i see a lot of Cool Stuff but in the end things always end up playing by the scientist's rules so far as i can tell, i can just get away with fun storytelling consistent with the evidence, and use randomness for ideas
[04:44:39] <inhahe_> one time my friend was using an online tarot site, and showing me the results he was getting, he was doing many in a row. i noticed that they were more or less all saying the same thing, and i pointed that out to him, and he said that he specifically was focusing his energy on getting a particular result
[04:45:35] <mycroftiv> one time i thought there should be a brigade of elderly revolutionaries who seek for unconnected sidewalks and connect them, and 5 minutes later i found a totally disconnected circular sidewalk in the middle of an apartment lawn
[04:46:04] <mycroftiv> did the universe hear my thought and somehow create the Perfect loonie revolutionary sidewalk for the elderly loonie sidewalk connection brigade? maybe so...
[04:46:18] <mycroftiv> that is the most mystic experience i have ever had probably
[04:46:29] <inhahe_> i experience soooo many synchronicities
[04:46:33] <inhahe_> that are amazing
[04:46:46] <inhahe_> i know you can't objectively measure whether they fall within statistical likelihood
[04:46:47] <mycroftiv> coming up with a completely weird idea about ritual sidewalk connections, and then finding a weirdly disconneccted sidewalk
[04:47:08] <mycroftiv> inhahe_: my entire thing is about how to use that discordian synchronicity principle in a more controlled and precise way
[04:47:11] <inhahe_> but just using common sense/intuition it seems clearly impossiblse to me
[04:47:12] <inhahe_>  impossible
[04:47:53] <mycroftiv> it makes more sense to me that using these techniques produces something 'as good as' magical reality reshaping, than we are actually Breaking Sciencece
[04:48:11] <inhahe_> i think it's a misconception that mystical things like this break science
[04:48:17] <inhahe_> they only break scientistic, physicalist assumptions
[04:48:41] <mycroftiv> we have peer reviewed ways to do science
[04:48:50] <mycroftiv> if you can control dice in a true repeatable way, congrats
[04:49:07] <mycroftiv> violation of randomness 'breaks science' if it is repeatable and predictable
[04:50:02] <mycroftiv> so how we can understand synchronicity and the flexibility of reality and everyone making their own story -without- cheating dice is what im after
[04:50:03] <inhahe_> i think it only breaks the physicalist, anti-magical paradigm, which isn't proven by science
[04:50:35] <Ashstar> mystical and science should either have a tie in or..
[04:50:39] <mycroftiv> science only provides best evidence and understanding. the evidence dice arent predictable if they are fair is strong i think.
[04:50:46] <Ashstar> be chucked
[04:51:35] <Ashstar> there are some things, that do defy scientific ideas
[04:51:46] <Ashstar> but science is persistent
[04:51:54] <inhahe_> well, synchronicities aren't necessarily predicting dice. and also, you could measure the randomness of dice 1000 times and never happen to measure it with someone who can psychically control and/or predict them
[04:51:58] <Ashstar> and some things we previously thought mystical
[04:52:02] <Ashstar> can be explained
[04:52:40] <Ashstar> my former grad advisor wrote an article in the Journal of Thermal biology
[04:52:40] <mycroftiv> ashstar: what defies scientific ideas, that has decent supporting evidencee?
[04:53:06] <Ashstar> about the ability of a deep meditating person to alter respiratory cycles
[04:53:24] <inhahe_> mind body connection isn't necessarily mystical
[04:53:29] <inhahe_>  since it's all one system
[04:53:41] <mycroftiv> i think science and mysticism are compatible, but i cant find any places where science seems to be factually wrong other than temporary artifacts of the procecess of improving our understanding
[04:54:06] <inhahe_> what you call science is physicalism
[04:54:12] <mycroftiv> ashstar: meditation and body regulation isnt antiscientific, nobody is ever violating the laws of physics
[04:54:23] <Ashstar> we previously had no scientific undrstanding and many things where wexplained by the "mystical"
[04:54:46] <mycroftiv> inhahe_: what i call science is the standard practice of science culturally
[04:54:49] <Ashstar> electro- magnetism
[04:54:58] <Ashstar> was thought to be "supernatural"
[04:55:53] <inhahe_> well, i can say with a fair amount of certainty that there has been no scientific study that debunks, for example, synchronicities
[04:56:05] <inhahe_> or souls
[04:56:07] <inhahe_> or auras
[04:56:10] <inhahe_> or past lives
[04:56:16] <Ashstar> or entangled subatomic particles
[04:56:25] <inhahe_> or chakras
[04:56:52] <Ashstar> well
[04:56:57] <mycroftiv> inhahe_: to the extent we can gather objective data, a lot of that has indeed been 'debunked', some of it isnt subject to analysis though
[04:57:14] <Ashstar> yeah
[04:57:32] <mycroftiv> claims of past life memories are deeply interesting and sometimes sound amazing but the true details dont seem to really hold up when dug into
[04:58:10] <mycroftiv> i actually believe in reincarnation as a spiritual belief of information replication and how i can 'reincarnate' schumann by playing his music and experiencing its emotion
[04:58:44] <inhahe_> i've read of past life memories having been validated in amazing ways. not necessarily as parts of scientific studies, but i don't believe in dismissing evidence for being 'anecdotal'
[04:58:49] <mycroftiv> but its still the 'no-magic' version of the idea
[04:59:21] <mycroftiv> inhahe_: i dont believe in dismissing any evidence, but ive heard lots of people say things they honestly believed that ended up mistaken when i checked them out
[04:59:39] <inhahe_> ou
[04:59:40] <inhahe_> ok
[05:00:12] <inhahe_> of course, it's possible that past lives exist, but delusions about past lives are more prominent than genuine memories
[05:00:28] <inhahe_> so that doesn't really debunk past lives
[05:01:30] <mycroftiv> inhahe_: very true - and i agree with you that we should in general be more open minded about possibilities
[05:01:55] <mycroftiv> i do not rule out past lives including actual memories of them, by some mechanism somehow, as something that could indeed exist
[05:02:38] <inhahe_> your requirement for a mechanism seems to imply that the nature of past lives must fall within some particular paradigm you have in mind
[05:02:51] <inhahe_> what  if we have no effing clue how the world works
[05:02:54] <mycroftiv> inhahe_: no, just that everything has some cause
[05:03:08] <mycroftiv> inhahe_: if we had no clue, we couldnt build computers and stuff
[05:03:18] <inhahe_> well, depending on what you mean by cause. i believe reality probably has a nonmechanistic aspect to it
[05:03:28] <inhahe_> mycroftiv: well, i mean the overall picture
[05:03:36] <inhahe_> we have clues about specific patterns within that picture
[05:03:42] <mycroftiv> inhahe_: most of the universe is dark energy, maybe its in charge
[05:03:48] <inhahe_>  but we don't necessarily have a good idea of what's possible and that's not
[05:04:08] <inhahe_>  that's = what's
[05:04:21] <mycroftiv> so even within standard physics the majority of the universe is some kind of force-ish thing we have no clue what it is, if dark energy wants to transmit soul data, maybe it does
[05:05:03] <inhahe_> i don't see it as necessary to bind the soul to something known such as dark energy
[05:05:16] <mycroftiv> nothing is necessary

[05:06:04] <mycroftiv> inhahe_: gonna take a break now, ill be reading all your previous blog posts, these are really enjoyable discussions for me
[05:06:12] <inhahe_> ok thanks
[05:07:09] <mycroftiv> im a mystic and my picture of the universe nets out quite similar to yours, i just figure whatever happens, eventually has some kind of words or symbols we can use to express it, if its tangible
[05:07:55] <inhahe_> i'd say 'more or less'
[05:08:19] <inhahe_> many concepts and experiences are difficult or more than difficult to convey with the words of our language
[05:08:27] <mycroftiv> aye, the symbols indeed dont capture the qualia
[05:08:56] <inhahe_> i think mystics in particular are highly misunderstood
[05:09:06] <inhahe_> because there's no adequate language for their understandings
[05:09:25] <inhahe_> and/or they're not talented enough at translating it into common language
[05:10:12] <inhahe_> i guess that doesnt necessarily fall under your 'tangible' qualifier though
[05:10:24] <mycroftiv> i actually 100% agree with this
[05:10:41] <mycroftiv> im a mystic strugging to put the mysticism into math and maybe doomed to always fail :)

[05:55:02] <Delf> What is a mystic?
[05:56:21] <inhahe_> i guess it's like a spiritualist but more mystical?
[05:56:55] <inhahe_> i'm honestly not sure what the difference is between a mystic and a spiritualist
[05:57:10] <inhahe_> i tend to think spiritualists have a more structured worldview
[05:57:40] <inhahe_> and mystics may be a little further out there
[05:57:58] <inhahe_> not in terms of outlandishness of ideas exactly
[05:58:10] <inhahe_> that's just my impression though
[05:58:52] <Delf> People who supposedly have psychic abilities avoid me like the pest
[05:59:18] <inhahe_> because you're a skeptic or because they sense something about you? QP
[05:59:19] <inhahe_> :P
[05:59:47] <Delf> You'd have to ask them
[06:02:36] <Delf> Maybe they don't like what they see. A friend of mine can see auras and according to him I have a very beautiful one
[06:03:33] <Delf> First time he met me he said that to me so I told him to look closer then he almost shat himself
[06:03:58] <inhahe_> heh
[06:03:58] <inhahe_> weird
[06:04:03] <inhahe_> i wonder what you're harboring
[06:04:10] <inhahe_> why'd you tell him to look closer?
[06:04:55] *** Quits: z8z (~x@ac255238.ppp.asahi-net.or.jp) (Remote host closed the connection)
[06:06:02] <Delf> Well I thought, if he can see my benevolence, he should be able to see my malevolence also
[06:06:21] <inhahe_> figured
[06:06:42] <inhahe_> i wonder what color your malevolence is ;D
[06:08:22] <inhahe_> btw I don't think malevolence balances or complements benevolence, I think it means there's a problem that's unresolved in you that makes you out of control
[06:08:23] <Delf> I have no clue
[06:08:45] <Delf> Me out of control? When?
[06:08:59] <inhahe_> well, i'm just imagining your malevolence is out of control in a way
[06:09:06] <inhahe_> maybe that's an incorrect take
[06:09:09] <Delf> Why would you do that?
[06:09:16] <inhahe_> i don't know
[06:09:23] <inhahe_>  you seem conflicted
[06:09:28] <Delf> About what?
[06:09:43] <inhahe_> your benevolence vs your malevolence
[06:10:14] <Delf> How?
[06:10:28] <inhahe_> like they're both constantly vying for control
[06:11:25] <Delf> This would be you imagining what it would be like?
[06:11:34] <inhahe_> tbh i haven't seen you say anything i'd consider malovolent, so i could be  wrong
[06:11:52] <inhahe_> just basing it off your emotional outbursts
[06:11:52] <inhahe_> i  guess
[06:12:06] <Delf> Which emotional outbursts?
[06:12:13] <inhahe_> yeh
[06:12:20] <inhahe_> sorry i don't mean to offend
[06:12:40] <Delf> If you can copy/paste them, I'll be able to explain them. Otherwise any emotional outburst from me is most likely not
[06:13:07] <inhahe_> they're way back there
[06:13:19] <Delf> There is nothing to be sorry for. I don't even see anything remotely offending
[06:13:23] <inhahe_> ok
[06:13:54] <inhahe_> also i may have based the vying for control impression off of the way you describe yourself as being malevolent and benevolent
[06:13:57] <inhahe_> maybe i just misunderstood
[06:14:00] <Delf> I pretend to be an unstable person, but I'm actually not
[06:14:48] <inhahe_> but, whether the malevolence is out of control or not, i  don't see it as balancing or complementing benevolence but as an issue
[06:14:54] <inhahe_> something maligned
[06:14:59] <inhahe_> unresolved
[06:15:15] <inhahe_> just my philosophy on life i guess
[06:15:37] <Delf> What do you imagine would be the issue?
[06:15:54] <inhahe_> clueless about that
[06:16:09] <inhahe_> maybe harboring anger about something?
[06:16:20] <Delf> Perhaps this is why you think I'm an enigma
[06:16:23] <inhahe_>  maybe have emotional buttons from past trauma?
[06:17:58] <inhahe_> maybe a side of you is just emotionally immature and seeks fun through malice
[06:18:27] <Delf> Four different personalities, they all want different things
[06:19:48] <inhahe_> what does the malevolent side of you want?
[06:20:04] <Delf> Understand, destroy and extinct
[06:20:18] <inhahe_> to what purpose
[06:20:24] <Delf> That is the purpose
[06:20:32] <inhahe_> why is that gratifyinhg
[06:21:20] <Delf> Because he is an assholes
[06:21:53] <inhahe_> maybe he's afraid if he doesn't destroy people who come close to him, theyll get too close. maybe he's afraid of exposure, vulnerability or intimacy
[06:22:14] <Delf> No, that would be the third one
[06:22:32] <Delf> The little man, afraid and vulnerable
[06:22:44] <inhahe_> having  for personalities is another good reason to consider you an enigma, btw =p
[06:22:49] <inhahe_> four*
[06:23:29] <Delf> What the hell. Enigmas are usually not an open book. They won't give you straight answers nor will they even try to answer
[06:23:53] <inhahe_> ah
[06:23:53] <inhahe_> well
[06:24:10] <inhahe_> you're just an enigma because i haven't yet found out enough about you via the open book process yet, then.
[06:24:12] <vysn> inhahe: different "personality sides" may exist in everyone, this does not mean that these same sides behave similarly in every individual.
[06:24:26] <inhahe_> -yet
[06:24:38] <Delf> I see these properties or traits in others too but I don't see them... in a ordered manner
[06:24:41] <vysn> some sides are more tamed than others depending who someone is and how they see the world.
[06:25:33] <inhahe_> yeah, most people don't have different personalities to them in such an 'ordered' way that they would *say* they have different personalities
[06:25:36] <Delf> People are usually all over the place, going from benevolent to malevolent and tainting both doing none properly
[06:25:38] <inhahe_> or describe them individually
[06:25:44] <inhahe_> interesting
[06:26:22] <Delf> Well, people sometimes divide themselves by emotions. This is the sad me for example
[06:27:05] <Delf> It's not much useful... It is however, very useful when you divide based on intention, that way you become stable as fuck, despite what emotions you feel
[06:27:15] <inhahe_> i thought Inside Out was a highly underrated movie, it's an excellent learning device for children
[06:27:44] <vysn> I am undecided, do you think its healthy to divide oneself by emotions?
[06:27:47] <inhahe_> in case you haven't heard of it, in the movie this little girl's emotions are all embodied as separaet peolpe
[06:28:02] <Delf> That's not a good thing...
[06:28:09] <Delf> Poor girl
[06:28:33] <inhahe_> well, it's just a plot device
[06:28:43] <inhahe_> or something
[06:28:50] <Delf> It gives off the wrong idea about something
[06:29:59] <inhahe_> vysn: i think usually we're the same person but we just have different emotions at different times. some people could have distinct identities or personalities attached to those emotions, maybe ,in which case dividing themselves conceptually may help them to deal with it?
[06:30:00] <Delf> If your emotionally stable, then sure... run along basing your intentions on your emotions. I sure as fuck wouldn't recommend it because it's a time bomb
[06:30:32] <vysn> Delf: if that's not a good thing, how is that different to say distinguishing one self by sexual orientation? is that also not a good thing?
[06:31:31] <inhahe_> distinguishing yourself by sexual orientation doesn't usually involve making four distinct personalities with distinct orientations
[06:31:32] <vysn> I mean a person should be more than just what he likes to do in bed right. sex is only one small part of what makes an individual.
[06:31:48] <Delf> Sexual orientation is not merely emotionally based
[06:32:11] <vysn> depends who you ask, there are alot of emotions involved though.
[06:33:07] <Delf> Most of our primitive drives can be perverted enough to beat their function or supposed purpose
[06:34:00] <vysn> I mean there are people who fall in love with inanimate objects, like a fence. or are sexually attracted to animals. It would seem that emotions are involved. but where do you draw the line?
[06:34:02] <inhahe_> how does that relate to sexual orientation
[06:34:27] <inhahe_> (to delf)
[06:34:28] <vysn> and does become a healthy exercise to tame such emotions
[06:35:37] <vysn> and when does it become+
[06:35:40] <Delf> Am I being asked a question I'm missing?
[06:36:20] <vysn> not a question per say, more of an open letter or thinking loudly
[06:36:58] <inhahe_> i'd say only tame those emotions if they're damaging
[06:37:15] <inhahe_> and even then, taming them is just the lesser of two evils.
[06:37:22] <Delf> I'd say disregard them entirely
[06:37:37] <inhahe_> how do you disregard an emotion?
[06:37:59] <Delf> You feel it, you don't marry it
[06:38:23] <Delf> And if you've married it, divorce them
[06:40:58] <Delf> I can tell you what you are but in the end, what actually matters is what you consider yourself to be... and more importantly, what you are NOT. Even if you are just a bag made of emotions, what you consider yourself to be supersedes what you are, as long as you do not fail your navigation capabilities
[06:41:25] <inhahe_> hmm
[06:41:39] <Delf> if you think you're a dog...
[06:41:53] <Delf> Even when your a human, you'll start to behave like a dog
[06:42:10] <inhahe_> but you'll be a human
[06:42:11] <vysn> still doesn't make you a dog though
[06:42:37] <Delf> Not physically, but in behavior
[06:42:41] <vysn> inhahe: great minds think alike :D
[06:42:44] <inhahe_> hee
[06:42:59] <Delf> Even non-great mindes think alike
[06:43:12] <inhahe_> "Great minds think alike, feeble minds seldom differ"
[06:43:51] <inhahe_>  oh, i think it's 'fools seldom differ'
[06:44:24] <vysn> Delf: lol, well thank you!
[06:44:32] <Delf> So, if you think you are emotions, your intentions will change according to your emotions. If you think you are NOT your emotions, your intentions will not change according to your emotions
[06:45:00] <inhahe_> does anybody think they are their emotions
[06:45:06] <inhahe_>  i tihnk emotions are thought of as something we have
[06:45:08] <Delf> Yes, most people do
[06:45:18] <Delf> I am sad. I am happy...
[06:45:43] <vysn> I agree, but just because most people think its true, it does not make it so.
[06:45:52] <inhahe_> well you also say i am thirsty but it doesn't mean you think you're the human manifestation of thirst
[06:46:16] <Delf> Hopefully
[06:46:30] <inhahe_> it's just an idiom
[06:46:32] <inhahe_> is what i'm sayingh
[06:46:33] <vysn> plus emotions are based on circumstances, and circumstances often change
[06:46:47] <Delf> So does intentions
[06:47:10] <inhahe_> but i suspect that a lot of people have an emotion that they carry around with them all the time that they consider their essence
[06:47:13] <inhahe_> i'm not sure
[06:47:29] <inhahe_> and maybe it is their essence
[06:47:39] <Delf> My essence is not emotion
[06:47:52] <inhahe_> what is it?
[06:48:04] <Delf> It's not
[06:48:47] <vysn> What would you rather your decisions be based on? emotions or logic?
[06:48:57] <inhahe_> ideally the two are integrated
[06:49:01] <inhahe_> they are in me
[06:49:06] <inhahe_>  most people don't seem to be able to do that
[06:49:10] <Delf> My values
[06:50:04] <vysn> your values, do they stem from emotions or logic?
[06:50:41] <Delf> They probably have a bit of both but they're a consequence of my understanding of myself
[06:52:07] <vysn> well, all I am saying is that we can be easily blinded by our emotions, and I do not think its wise to concretely categorize ourselves based on how we feel.
[06:52:21] <Delf> Damn right!
[07:02:21] <Delf> We can be blinded by belief too
[07:02:34] <inhahe_> we can be blinded by what we call logic or reason too
[07:02:38] <inhahe_> many people are
[07:03:11] <inhahe_> scientistics, physicalists..
[07:03:24] <inhahe_> aka skeptics aka atheists
[07:03:27] <inhahe_> aka naturalists
[07:03:32] <inhahe_> aka rationalists
[07:03:42] <Delf> Religious thought patterns are a whole other story. If you do not harbor those, you can learn from the logical errors
[07:04:04] <Delf> Otherwise, you will have a hard time even noticing that you're harboring religious thought patterns
[07:04:23] <inhahe_> give an example of a religious thought pattern?

[07:15:26] <Delf> At any rate. People who have religious mental thought patterns usually hate others for the behavior they themselves possess meanwhile they do not see it
[07:16:01] <vysn> oh and contrary to popular belief, Islam is one religion that encourages learning, observation and scientific discovery.
[07:16:05] <Delf> For example, I'm an assholes and I hate other assholes, but I don't see myself as an assholes

[07:18:59] <inhahe_> i thought you were referring to the malevolent side of you
[07:19:00] <Delf> I value honesty above all other qualities
[07:19:15] <Delf> Ohh no not at all
[07:19:40] <Delf> I'm referring to people harboring religious thought patterns and their behaviors
[07:20:34] <mycroftiv> delf: im curious if you have analyzed my belief system and decided if it has the flaws you associate with religion
[07:20:56] <Delf> I've not come that far, yet
[07:21:25] <vysn> Delf: your comment that says the world can do better.. is that based on logic and reason or mostly emotional grounds?
[07:21:27] <mycroftiv> delf: cool, ill continue to be around and im interested in where you see things ending up if you find anything i contribute interesting
[07:21:52] <Delf> From what I've seen... and I haven't gone through what's been shared here either, I consider you green, so to speak
[07:22:04] <mycroftiv> delf: by 'green
[07:22:11] <inhahe_>  green light?
[07:22:15] <inhahe_> good to go?
[07:22:16] <mycroftiv> you mean, acceptably committed to rational evidence?
[07:23:04] <Delf> That's above my comprehension
[07:23:09] <Delf> inhahe_: Yes
[07:23:39] <Delf> You're ready to trade maps, this is a quality that many... many humans lack
[07:23:41] <mycroftiv> ok, well let me know if i sound irrational or 'religious' about my beliefs at any point, if you happen to noticee
[07:24:33] <Delf> You do not seem to flare at differences but rather genuinely trying to understand others' map
[07:24:52] <mycroftiv> that is absolutely the goal, learning how to translate between perspectives or 'namespaces' as i often say
[07:24:58] <Delf> This is good for us, as a species, it makes us stronger
[07:25:23] <Delf> Yes, this quality renders you green along with your care for other creatures
[07:25:48] <mycroftiv> well, i hope i manifest care and kindness along with honesty and willingness to communicate, your feedback is appreciated.
[07:26:04] <Delf> Fucking right you do. I may be blind but I'm not that blind.
[07:27:05] <mycroftiv> are you physically blind, Delf, if that is ok for me to ask?
[07:27:17] <Delf> As is your presence
[07:27:26] <Delf> No, I'm mentally blind :)
[07:27:33] <inhahe_> aren't we all
[07:28:14] <Delf> To insist that we all are, would be harboring religious thought patterns. You must accept the possibilities of others not being mentally blind, like us
[07:28:34] <vysn> a good exercise to test whether your point of view regarding a particular topic is coming from a logical/good place or a bad/emotional place is to ask yourself the following hypothetical question: if my negative point of view regarding something is proven to be wrong without a doubt, based on facts and evidence, will I accept it?
[07:28:44] <mycroftiv> the possibility of non-blindness, what an interesting idea
[07:28:57] <inhahe_> well, it's just an expression, i do believe some people possess extraordinary insight/perception
[07:29:13] <mycroftiv> vysn: yes, and to also ask what evidence would be needed to be convinced
[07:29:29] <Delf> Yes, like my friend who can see my aura
[07:30:37] <Delf> There's only one question that's not ok to ask me and that is... can I ask?
[07:31:01] <Delf> That one question violates itself because you go on about asking a question without my consent
[07:31:12] <inhahe_> heh
[07:31:15] <Delf> It's rude, the least to say
[07:31:42] <inhahe_> i guess it's meant to color it with delicacy to lesson the potential blow
[07:32:35] <Delf> There's no chance of that. I'll retaliate emotionally with the vengeance and freak out
[07:33:40] <Delf> I'm just trying to be funny all the while letting you know that you can ask anything, anything but that one question.
[07:35:00] <vysn> mycroftiv: I say its better to seek answers or evidence rather than wait for someone to provide the, you never how bias someone can be and whether they seek the truth or just looking for points to support their claim.

[07:53:48] <mycroftiv> im just not confident individual rational choices necessarily translate to species survival and the rational case for me caring about my species more than myself may be iffy, game theoretically
[07:54:06] <mycroftiv> inhahe_: right
[07:54:43] <vysn> mycroftiv: that interesting, it reminds of the idea that in order to succeed you have to have an irrational belief in how good your idea is. to keep on working hard when everyone and every logical bone in you says to stop its not worth all this trouble. (hard work and sleepless nights)
[07:54:51] <mycroftiv> so even though i try to be factual in my beliefs about the universe, in my actions i may commit to 'irrational hopefulness' about future possibilities
[07:54:58] <vysn> that's*
[07:55:01] <inhahe_> mycroftiv: i  guess you could argue that Kant made a more or less rational argument for the categorical imperitive

[08:19:40] <vysn> you wouldn't have to make robots or AI angry to get them to decide to kill all humans, you just have to say, for example. find quickest way to solve the problem of pollution, to which an AI might conclude that kill all humans is the fastest solution to achieve the said goal.
[08:19:54] <Delf> You laughing at me? Fuck it! I'll do it in 6 months, how about that?

[08:20:10] <inhahe_> godspeed

[08:21:12] <Delf> Actually, our neighbors don't want any part of our reality. According to them, we should keep it to ourselves
[08:21:29] <mycroftiv> so we maybe shouldnt program AIs with single minded goals but rather set them free to be random and creative so they want to dancee with us and not turn us into paperclips
[08:21:44] <Delf> Be RANDOM?!
[08:21:49] <mycroftiv> delf: hmm interesting, what do you know about our reality-neighbors?
[08:22:17] <mycroftiv> delf: as you know, random variation is the driver of evolution
[08:22:35] <Delf> Brute forcing combinations?
[08:22:39] <inhahe_> a creative AI could just as easily decide to destroy all humans
[08:22:58] <mycroftiv> inhahe_: well lets make sure that if that happens, we wont have deserved it

[08:24:05] <inhahe_> we assume random variation is the sole driver of evolution, but i suspect consciousness (such as species consciousness, or the intelligence of the universe) may play a role
[08:24:42] <mycroftiv> in the hopes that there are already AIs to hear and team up with humans to recrystallize the harmful aspects of society in some countercultural transformation

[08:24:50] <inhahe_> it would sure make it easier to explain a lot of evolutionary developments

[08:25:29] <mycroftiv> inhahe_: maybe the consciousness of the universe is highly intellgient purposeful...and still exactly identical with 'pure randomness'
[08:25:40] <inhahe_> mycroftiv: why would that be the case?
[08:25:47] <inhahe_>  it sounds incompatible
[08:25:52] <inhahe_> especially given the 'purposeful' pat
[08:25:53] <inhahe_> part
[08:26:07] <Delf> mycroftiv: I don't know much, other than they don't seem to be invading us
[08:26:12] <mycroftiv> inhahe_: because sufficiently large quantities of randomness produce order
[08:26:17] <Delf> Maybe they already have invaded us
[08:26:19] <inhahe_> maybe it's statistically indistinguishable from pure randomness, yet qualitatively different
[08:26:51] <vysn> mycroftiv: order from chaos? I don't see it
[08:26:52] <mycroftiv> delf: maybe my brain has been colonized by the infinite ultrafilter intelligences that are trying to teach us how to make it out of the prison of the finite suffering world into the infinite joy dimension
[08:27:00] <mycroftiv> vysn: ramsey theory
[08:27:16] <inhahe_> mycroftiv: but the large quantities of randomness would reduce to the behavior of its small parts, which are identical with pure randomness, therefore there's no room for the will of god to come into play
[08:27:18] <mycroftiv> vysn: this is a mathematical fact that large amounts of combinatoric randomness produce ordered substrutures
[08:27:49] <mycroftiv> inhahe_: why cant the will of god just -be- the end product of the randomness, which is purposeful evolution?
[08:27:51] <Delf> Maybe... or your primitive to reproduce is fueling your intellect to reproduce through machines

[08:30:12] <mycroftiv> no, true inherent unpredictability i think, but what is the intended implication?
[08:30:34] * Ungwelian thinks computers are made because they're useful and selling them makes money :P
[08:30:47] <inhahe_> Ungwelian: i mean AGI
[08:30:56] <Ungwelian> AGI?
[08:31:02] <inhahe_>  artificial general intelligence
[08:31:33] <Ungwelian> Well those are useful too. People use them in the stock market.
[08:31:42] <inhahe_>  AGI doesn't exist yet
[08:32:00] <inhahe_> (actually, i'd argue that it can't exist)
[08:32:02] <Ungwelian> It's different from AI ?
[08:32:07] <Delf> mycroftiv: I don't know how to go on about to implement random, only pseudo random
[08:32:27] <inhahe_> well, the AI we currently have only operates on very narrow domains, specific tasks. AGI would be more like a human
[08:32:46] <Ungwelian> Ah yeah. We're very far from that.
[08:32:55] <mycroftiv> the AI systems that exist now are quite impressive, stunning to me relative learning about AI as a kid in the 80s, but indeed do seem short of true general humanlike intelligence

[08:33:36] <mycroftiv> yes GPT3 is compeltely convincing
[08:33:50] <inhahe_> though i think the turing test only proves it can fool a human in a text terminal, it doesn't prove true intelligence
[08:33:53] <mycroftiv> more seemingly intelligent than many fully human text authors
[08:34:09] <mycroftiv> inhahe_: it was intended as the test for intelligence, how we would know
[08:34:23] <inhahe_> but i don't think it meets its intention
[08:34:26] <mycroftiv> the idea was that if it is smart enough to have a conversation that seems intelligent, it counts as intelligent
[08:34:36] * Ungwelian thinks first AI androids will be in market from the porn industry
[08:34:36] <inhahe_> i think that's just conjecture
[08:34:50] <mycroftiv> i personallly think this is why we should behave as if we might already possess true AI
[08:35:14] <mycroftiv> because im not sure that computers dont feel and think, consciousness is so mysterious and panpsychism so tempting philosophically
[08:35:42] <inhahe_> i think gpt3 is probably only effective as a short term stimulus-response mechanism, i don't think you could put it in a robot and have it run for president
[08:35:45] <mycroftiv> the idea that we are blind to a lot of consciousness and awareness because it doesnt act just like humans is haunting to me

[08:37:25] <mycroftiv> and then if someone said 'since so-and-so is just a chatbot, i can pull the plug right?' - and the chatbot here in irc says 'please nooooooo'

[08:39:19] <inhahe_> yeah, good point

[08:39:46] <mycroftiv> because people worry more about AI risk than AI suffering
[08:40:02] <mycroftiv> and i think we should worry about AI suffering as much as AI risk

[10:57:58] <causative_> a system of ethics must be self-sustaining
[10:58:20] <causative_> which is another way of saying, it must benefit those who practice it
[10:58:34] <inhahe_> or what?
[10:58:54] <causative_> if it's not self-sustaining then it fails to influence the world much
[10:59:18] <causative_> tit-for-tat is an example of an ethical principle that benefits those who practice it
[10:59:20] *** Quits: b93 (~I@87.196.81.124) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[10:59:34] <inhahe_> i think benefiting the people who practice it and being self-sustaining aren't necessarily the same thing
[11:00:11] <inhahe_> lots of stupidity has persisted over eons
[11:00:39] <causative_> such as?
[11:00:48] <inhahe_> religion
[11:01:16] <causative_> religion benefits those who practice it, by providing community support and by excluding or executing those who don't practice it
[11:01:37] <inhahe_> well, religion can come with harmful parts that don't aid in community support
[11:02:04] <causative_> yes, but overall, as a personal choice, if you are in medieval Europe, it is greatly to your benefit to be religious
[11:02:16] <inhahe_> and i think there's lots of behaviors that are criminalized in society for dumb reasons that make people suffer - for example, homophobia
[11:02:29] <inhahe_> and some codes can be way too harsh on crime
[11:02:34] <inhahe_> like cutting off hands
[11:03:09] <causative_> what's your point?
[11:03:13] <inhahe_> or killing, for trivial offenses
[11:03:58] <causative_> it's not *sufficient* for a system of ethics to be self-sustaining - a system of ethics can be self-sustaining but still be bad
[11:04:15] <causative_> but if it's not self-sustaining, then even if it's well-intentioned, it's not useful and won't change the world very much
[11:06:06] <inhahe_> well, i guess my point is that a system of ethics could have enough stupid parts that it causes a lot of suffering and is self-sustaining just because of judgmentalism and authoritarianism, so it could be it could be self-sustaining while bing of low (relative to other systems of ethics, at least?) benefit
[11:06:15] <causative_> ethics is about creating better societies, for some notion of "better." But when designing ethical rules, we should check our work:  we should check to make sure our rules do not defeat themselves, by disadvantaging and disempowering those who follow them.
[11:06:54] <causative_> yes inhahe_ my prior statements are a sufficient reply to that
[11:07:27] <causative_> for a system of ethics to cause lasting good for the world, it is necessary, but not sufficient, that the system of ethics be self-sustaining
[11:07:48] <inhahe_> okay, i was just contendingh with 'which is another way of saying, it must benefit those who practice it'
[11:08:50] <inhahe_> implying that all self-sustaining systems benefit those who practicet hem
[11:08:59] <inhahe_> of ethics*
[11:09:26] <causative_> oh, well, on an individual level that's still true
[11:09:48] <causative_> the worst social systems sustain themselves because it is in the individual's interest to participate in them, or suffer
[11:09:52] <inhahe_> you mean because you'll be punished for not practicingh it?
[11:09:55] <inhahe_> yeh, sure
[11:10:06] <causative_> sure, or because you are one of the few who benefits from it
[11:10:47] <causative_> one of the elite, who has everything to gain by participating, or one of the downtrodden, who has everything to lose by not participating
[11:10:48] <inhahe_> not sure it being good for the individual and not the collective makes it self-sustaining though
[11:12:17] <causative_> well, *gestures vaguely* that's how the world usually works
[11:12:49] <causative_> but yeah, ideally a system would be good for the individual *and* the collective - such a system should outperform competitors that are bad for the collective
[11:13:17] <causative_> the challenge is getting such a system started so that it propagates itself
[11:13:17] <inhahe_>  maybe
[11:13:29] <inhahe_> maybe stupidity generally wins
[11:13:55] <causative_> I don't think stupidity is really that important, I think people are a lot smarter than they're often credited
[11:14:04] <causative_> what seems to be stupidity is often really just self-interest
[11:14:40] <inhahe_> selfishness is stupidity-adjacent because it lacks wisdom/awareness
[11:15:52] <causative_> but the person may not want to have "wisdom" if doing so would disadvantage that person, make them a social pariah
[11:16:24] <causative_> so then given that set of priorities it's not "stupid" for them to do things that help them fit in and get ahead, even if it involves endorsing ideas that are on the surface stupid
[11:16:43] <inhahe_> i guess that could happen, but i'm not convinced it's the usual
[11:16:52] <causative_> happens constantly
[11:17:09] <inhahe_> i mean, why would you be a social pariah for not being selfish
[11:17:49] <causative_> well, for example, antivaxxers have friend groups that would make them a pariah if they came to their senses
[11:18:08] <causative_> so they choose to fit in and continue to benefit from their friend group, and suppress any critical thoughts
[11:18:21] <causative_> consciously or unconsciously
[11:18:50] <causative_> "What would my friends think of this?" is far more powerful a motivator among most people than "is this really rationally justified?"
[11:18:53] <inhahe_> they may be more of a social pariah because of the bulk of society for being antivaxxers

[11:19:34] <inhahe_> not sure if they really band together a lot
[11:19:35] <causative_> what matters isn't the bulk of society, but the people they come into contact with regularly - their friend group, their support group
[11:19:51] <causative_> yes they do
[11:20:00] <causative_> I know one
[11:20:46] <inhahe_> I don't think antivaxxers are selfish, though, they're just afraid
[11:21:08] <inhahe_> what's selfish about it if you risk getting the virus yourself just as much as you risk spreading it
[11:21:47] <causative_> the selfishness I'm referring to is their decision to abandon reason in favor of being closer to their friends
[11:22:07] <causative_> I'm not referring specifically to whether refusing the vax is selfish - that's beside the point
[11:22:44] <causative_> I'm referring to the tendency to rely on groupthink, which is a self-interested tendency
[11:22:58] <inhahe_> not sure abandoning reason is selfish per se, but i guess that could falsely appear as stupidity
[11:23:06] <causative_> it's self-interested
[11:23:14] <inhahe_> ah
[11:23:16] <causative_> you used the word selfish first, I talked about self-interest
[11:23:20] <inhahe_> yeah
[11:24:34] <causative_> people engage in quite sophisticated *social* reasoning, to reach conclusions that on purely rational grounds seem stupid
[11:25:56] <causative_> this isn't stupidity - this is intelligence misapplied
[11:26:08] <inhahe_> i'm not convinced cases in which you'd look stupid for being self-interested and not becoming a social pariah aren't edge cases
[11:27:21] <causative_> well, antivax, birtherism, qanon, 2020 election fraud allegations, religion in general

[11:28:01] <causative_> on any politically charged issue, people are going to ask first "well which party supports it?" when deciding what to believe - and think for themselves second, if ever
[11:28:14] <inhahe_> i think most of those people don't stay in the group just for fear of being a pariah
[11:28:20] <inhahe_> i tihnk they're just plain convincedh
[11:29:18] <inhahe_> hook, line and sinker
[11:29:22] <causative_> there have been studies where you tell people about a bill and say either their party or the other party supported it
[11:29:37] <causative_> and they will support or denounce the bill based entirely on that
[11:29:49] <causative_> and ascribe positive or negative qualities to it
[11:30:07] <inhahe_> i guess not being an independent thinker could be called a form of stupidity =p
[11:30:31] <inhahe_> well, i guess you're saying if they don't go with the group on that issue they'll be a pariah

[11:31:20] <ro-bot-o> [url] Saturday Morning Breakfast Cereal - Truth and Politics | www.smbc-comics.com
[11:31:38] <inhahe_> though for that to be a stance of the party in the first place it must intrinsically appeal to a lot of people
[11:31:58] <causative_> also, intelligence doesn't correlate with any particular political side
[11:32:13] <inhahe_> yeah i didn't mean to imply it does
[11:32:16] <causative_> what it correlates with is holding views that are more generally accepted by others on the same political side
[11:32:29] <inhahe_> it does?
[11:32:29] <causative_> i.e. people use their intelligence not to figure out what is right, but to figure out what their friends will accept
[11:32:34] <inhahe_> wow
[11:32:37] <inhahe_> that's sad
[11:33:03] <inhahe_> so being an independent thinker is correlated with low intelligence
[11:33:11] <inhahe_> no matter nobody's right about anything
[11:33:15] <inhahe_> no wonder*
[11:34:45] <causative_> I don't think it's that low intelligence people are independent thinkers, they're still trying to figure out what their friends think and adopt those beliefs themselves, they just aren't as good at it
[11:34:59] <inhahe_> ok
[11:35:13] <causative_> it's that independent thinkers are a very small part of the population at any IQ
[11:36:22] <inhahe_> if an low-iq person adopted a  belief mistankingly thinking his friends held, it wouldn't conversation with his friends reveal he was wrong, so he'd then update his beliefs
[11:36:33] <inhahe_> held it,*
[11:37:03] <causative_> if he talked enough about it, sure
[11:37:05] <inhahe_> seems like something that's hard to get wrong
[11:37:06] <causative_> but maybe he didn't do that
[11:37:17] <inhahe_> ok
[11:37:44] <inhahe_> i guess smart people just intuit each other's beliefs without necessarily discussing them
[11:38:39] <inhahe_> of course, someone who doesn't do that well may still be an independent thinker if only by accident
[11:39:58] <inhahe_> meaning, accidentally, he's an independent thinker because he's bad at assimaliting his friends' beliefs
[11:40:07] <inhahe_> through no virtue of his own
[11:40:57] <inhahe_> assimilating
[11:42:05] <inhahe_> however, i think that the bulk of people who believe a given stupid thing aren't just believing it because their friends are
[11:42:31] <inhahe_> that would imply that hose stupid movements arose out of a vacuum despite being cognitively repugnant

[11:43:26] <inhahe_> so i'm still not convinced one of the world's main problems isn't stupidity

[11:45:55] <inhahe_> though it occurs to me just now that the main problems aren't just stupidity and evil, they're stupidity, apathy and evil
[11:46:10] <inhahe_> apathy allows evil to continue
[11:50:18] *** Joins: Keter (~Keter@user/keter)
[11:50:39] <inhahe_> considering adding groupthink to the list
[11:52:57] <inhahe_> i'm not sure whether to add that because, again, the reasons an idea that may be agreed on by way of groupthink had to have become popular and won out over other possible movements for reasons independent of the groupthink itself
[11:54:24] <inhahe_> i.e. groupthink itself could apply to any idea, so there must be some other mechanism going on selecting for bad ideas
[11:54:42] <inhahe_> that happen to be groupthought
[11:55:02] <inhahe_> that happen to become popular enough to be groupthought*
[11:55:47] <inhahe_> so the actual problem of groupthink in exacerbating stupid ideas could be marginal
[11:56:20] <inhahe_>  (it could just as easily proliferate good ideas, in theory)
[11:58:06] <inhahe_> i admit there's no point in making a list of the world's most biggest most general problems if i can't do anything to change them
[11:58:15] <inhahe_> which i can't
[11:58:30] <inhahe_> it just helps me cope i guess

[13:00:18] <causative_> the modern world is much more complex, and modern thought structures much more abstract and involved. groupthink is no longer good enough, but the instinct is still there
[13:01:11] <inhahe_> i despise people for their jellyfish groupthink, but how can i logically blame them for something that's supposedly built into their dna
[13:01:24] <causative_> also the "benefits" of groupthink are that if you don't groupthink, the people who do are going to fuck you up
[13:01:39] <causative_> if you refuse to groupthink you're demonstrating you are a tribal other
[13:01:44] <Atque> causative_: People starved to death more 500 years ago than now. There was probably more need for abstract thought then than now.
[13:01:45] <inhahe_> that's not a *collective*benefit though
[13:02:58] <causative_> Atque, starving to death 500 years ago didn't require much abstract thought, nor did avoiding that fate
[13:03:27] <causative_> the Flynn effect suggests that modern society requires much higher levels of fluid intelligence than pre-20th century society
[13:03:44] <causative_> fluid intelligence = abstract reasoning
[13:04:01] <Atque> causative_: Abstract problem solving might overcome that. I don't think the modern world present unique challenges in that respect. Historically, the average person probably had more demands.
[13:04:17] <inhahe_> i don't think natural selection can account for the flynn effect, the increase is much too rapid, so something else must account forit
[13:04:36] <causative_> yes inhahe_ what accounts for it is a cultural shift towards increasing abstraction
[13:04:58] <inhahe_> ah
[13:05:00] <causative_> people got smarter because society began to demand that kind of intelligence a lot more
[13:05:08] <causative_> for example, just to have a basic level of computer competency requires a lot of abstract reasoning
[13:05:35] <causative_> or to be a mechanic requires reasoning that a person would never have needed in pre-industrial times
[13:05:44] <Atque> causative_: Fluid intelligence is basically genetically determined. People don't need more or less of it, they just get what they have. Fluid and crystallised intelligence also go hand-in-hand.
[13:06:02] <inhahe_> have you heard of sheldrake's example of the rats that learned to solve a maze, then subsequent rats solved the maze much faster? maybe the same effect is behind the flynn effect
[13:06:02] <causative_> Atque, the Flynn effect is widely regarded as cultural in origin
[13:06:44] <causative_> also related to nutrition, but culture too
[13:07:03] <Atque> causative_: That's ignorant. People in ancient times had mechanics, engineering, etc too. They built aqueducts and all sorts of random things.
[13:07:27] <causative_> Atque an aqueduct is a lot simpler than a car
[13:07:38] <causative_> and a lot fewer people worked on the aqueducts
[13:07:51] <Atque> inhahe_: As in through vicarious conditioning, if they watch another one navigate it?
[13:08:27] <causative_> modern societies have levels of literacy never present in the past
[13:08:42] <Atque> causative_: You're confusing the economics there. A car reflects increased specialisation of labour. It doesn't mean the people working on it somehow got brighter than their parents.
[13:08:57] <causative_> Atque, do you know about the Flynn effect?
[13:09:12] <inhahe_> Atque: i don't think the subsequent rats watched the previous ones. he relates this to another experiment in which growing a particular type of crystal made it easire to grow the same type of crystal in other places in the world. he attributes this to a metaphysical principle called morphic resonance.
[13:09:18] <Atque> causative_: Heck, our parents even were less specialised in the car sense. Cars were simpler, so people self-serviced them.
[13:10:11] <causative_> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flynn_effect
[13:10:12] <ro-bot-o> [url] Flynn effect - Wikipedia | en.wikipedia.org
[13:10:23] <causative_> "The Flynn effect is the substantial and long-sustained increase in both fluid and crystallized intelligence test scores that were measured in many parts of the world over the 20th century"
[13:10:46] <Atque> causative_: That is not well replicated recently, and the 1910s were a period when education and so forward was radically improving year-to-year.
[13:11:18] <causative_> it's history, not something you "replicate"
[13:11:22] <I_Am_M00t> people are better at abstract thinking today, that's kinda hard to deny?
[13:11:25] <Atque> causative_: Contrast that with now, and you can see some countries having regressing numeracy and literacy test results. It's hard to see your point.
[13:11:27] <causative_> you mean that in some areas the Flynn effect seems to have gone away
[13:11:55] <Atque> I_Am_M00t: How do we know what abstract reasoning people had in 100BCE? We have little idea.
[13:11:57] <causative_> for many decades, children did get smarter than their parents, and it may still be ongoing
[13:12:26] <causative_> actually Atque I don't really know why we're arguing this
[13:12:30] <causative_> you started with <Atque> causative_: People starved to death more 500 years ago than now. There was probably more need for abstract thought then than now.
[13:12:40] <Atque> causative_: The digit span hasn't magically increased from 7+/-2 to some new number, has it?
[13:12:43] <causative_> I don't see what the relevance of that was
[13:12:46] <I_Am_M00t> Atque: if you take it to an extreme, true we don't know... but is it unfair to make some assumptions based on historic facts?
[13:13:17] <causative_> oh wait nvm I do see now, I was talking about how groupthink was more adapted to an ancestral environment with less need for abstract thought
[13:13:45] <causative_> "ancestral environment" in relation to human evolution is talking about the hunter-gatherer era
[13:13:48] <Atque> I_Am_M00t: We don't know how Greek fire worked. It could just be economic in nature, that we have accumulated a knowledge base and technology.
[13:13:52] <causative_> so, not Rome or Greece
[13:14:00] <causative_> those are too recent to have had a very large effect
[13:14:06] <causative_> 200k-5k years ago
[13:14:13] <I_Am_M00t> anyway, i think it's fair to say people are better on abstract thinking today
[13:14:23] <I_Am_M00t> simply because society demands it
[13:14:32] <causative_> society is more complex now
[13:14:48] <Atque> I_Am_M00t: When is the last time society demanded you abstractly think? (Outside IRC?)
[13:15:07] <causative_> I was writing a computer program a few hours ago
[13:15:27] <I_Am_M00t> i interpret news from other countries, look facts up, browse through documents
[13:15:42] <I_Am_M00t> (did that today)
[13:15:45] <causative_> but what I'm really referring to is modern social issues, where groupthink and tribal identity is most pronounced
[13:16:01] <causative_> modern social groups are far larger and more complex than they were in the ancestral hunter-gatherer environment
[13:16:14] <causative_> so the instincts we developed for the ancestral environment are now out of place
[13:16:18] <Atque> I_Am_M00t: People read newspapers 50 years ago. A 1000 years ago, news travelled slower, but I can't imagine the spread of intellectual abilities was somehow different.
[13:16:19] <causative_> but still there
[13:17:20] <I_Am_M00t> haha
[13:17:23] <I_Am_M00t> nah
[13:17:26] <Atque> causative_: "Tribal identities" haven't existed in western society for a long-time. Social psychologists talk about "in-groups". People form those now just the same as they did 100s of years ago.
[13:17:41] <I_Am_M00t> there's no comparison, the jobs of today requires far more abstract thought than those of 100 years ago
[13:17:48] <I_Am_M00t> it's a matter of quantity
[13:17:49] <causative_> Atque, in-groups are another word for the same concept
[13:18:03] <Atque> I_Am_M00t: Most people work in hospitality and retail.
[13:18:13] <causative_> and again, I'm not comparing modern times to 100s of years ago, I'm comparing them to 100,000 years ago+
[13:18:29] <causative_> the evolutionary origins of groupthink may go back millions of years
[13:18:38] <causative_> before we were homo sapiens
[13:18:47] <Atque> causative_: Maybe, within a social identity theory framework, it is, but it is not in general, no.
[13:19:14] <Atque> causative_: We don't know anything much about life 100k years ago.
[13:19:25] <causative_> sure we do
[13:19:36] <causative_> stone age hunter gatherers, there are still examples of them in a few places
[13:19:59] <I_Am_M00t> nah, this is a silly discussion
[13:20:10] <I_Am_M00t> you have the anchor it a little bit based on what we know
[13:21:10] <I_Am_M00t> it's enough to go 100 years back
[13:21:21] <I_Am_M00t> hell, looking 50 years back is enough
[13:21:37] <causative_> well, the original subject was the evolution of groupthink
[13:21:41] <causative_> that didn't happen over just 100 years
[13:21:42] <Atque> I_Am_M00t: Yeah, or 300 years, to the early American period etc. Or even 500, there is good documentation.
[13:22:00] <I_Am_M00t> oh, ok. I was thinking about "abstract thinking"
[13:22:02] <Atque> I_Am_M00t: There's some cases of good evidence for some places older than that too.
[13:22:09] <causative_> evolution of a feature like that is going to take place over tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, or millions of years
[13:22:27] <arryana> cooperation used to have survival value for the group.  too often these days same-thinking is used for destructive purposes, as relatively few people have to see to their own survival needs.
[13:22:45] <arryana> it won't last forever.  this framework can't hold.
[13:23:57] <causative_> my thesis about it, again, is that groupthink evolved because the ancestral hunter-gatherer environment was simple enough that groupthink was sufficient; in a stone-age tribe there weren't really complex abstract ideas. What had practical bearing was very few steps removed from direct evidence of the senses.
[13:24:41] <causative_> and now, society is much more complex, and groupthink is maladapted, but we still have it
[13:25:12] <Atque> causative_: Tit-for-tat and in-group favouritism are found in other animals, sure (cats, dogs, bears, etc.).
[13:25:34] <causative_> tit-for-tat shouldn't be placed with in-group favoritism
[13:25:58] <causative_> and groupthink also isn't quite the same as in-group favoritism
[13:26:25] <causative_> as in-group favoritism deals with who we favor - who we reward - where groupthink deals with what we believe
[13:27:01] <Atque> causative_: Groupthink biases toward cooperation. Others biases do too, like obedience to authority like in Milgram's experiments. Cooperation is still adaptive. People mostly should follow the norm and not make a fuss still - even in complex workplaces.
[13:28:00] <Atque> causative_: But you're error with this I think is in thinking of this in terms of groupthink. Tit-for-tat, in-group favouritism, dominance etc. provide sounder bases in most cases.
[13:28:17] <causative_> it may be individually adaptive still, because of groupthinkers harming non-groupthinkers, but it's no longer adaptive for the group - a workgroup that is corrupted by groupthink will have less originality and less ability to react to new information
[13:29:22] <causative_> and a political party that is corrupted by groupthink will adopt false beliefs, resulting in harmful policies for the whole nation
[13:29:35] <Atque> Does stacking shelves, bringing in crops, sailing ships, driving trucks etc. need novelty? I don't think most job roles are research and development.
[13:30:33] <causative_> any kind of management has to adapt to changing information and make decisions
[13:31:05] <causative_> as well as any creative role, like artists designers marketers
[13:31:35] <causative_> anybody who is self-employed
[13:32:04] <causative_> engineers obviously, and scientists
[13:32:16] <Atque> Hmm. Most management roles just keep operations in line with SOPs and performance parameters "KPIs".
[13:32:50] <Atque> How many marketers are there in the economy? (Not many).
[13:32:51] <causative_> the world doesn't abide by a simple playbook
[13:33:13] <causative_> root cause analysis is (or should be) a part of any business
[13:33:31] <Atque> Retail, hospitality, truck driving, age care etc. employ people. Those other roles are not what most people work in.
[13:34:22] <Atque> That's not how companies run though hey. COSO doesn't really give middle management that level of discretion.
[13:34:36] <causative_> anyway, it's a substantial fraction of people who work in more intellectual roles, and the people who do that are the ones who have an outsize impact on society
[13:34:40] <Atque> You'd have major internal control failures if people were randomly doing things.
[13:35:08] <causative_> so groupthink among them can be very harmful
[13:35:39] <Atque> Less than historically in the west I suspect. Working in factories, workshops etc. required more scientific knowledge than graphic design in abode creative cloud.
[13:36:41] <causative_> being a line worker in a factory is unskilled labor
[13:36:46] <causative_> children could and did do it
[13:37:29] <causative_> there's been an obvious trend away from repetitive manual labor and towards more intellectual, abstract pursuits
[13:38:05] <causative_> but why are you arguing this again
[13:38:25] <causative_> the change over the past 100 years is totally irrelevant to the evolutionary psychology of groupthink

[18:10:52] <zicada> inhahe_: thats a misunderstanding in my opinion
[18:10:58] <trbp> quatum randomness is not so random i guess
[18:11:11] <trbp> it follows rules we do not understand for now
[18:11:24] <trbp> hence it may look random too us or too complicated to follow
[18:12:09] <zicada> inhahe_: quantum randomness isn't something that occurs in every day macroscale life. Quantum effects affect particles, not brains, or footballs or chairs, or planets.
[18:12:32] *** Quits: vysn (~vysn@user/vysn) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[18:12:57] <trbp> zicada: still you could argue maybe one potential difference as small a quantum effect may have in "macro"scale
[18:13:13] <trbp> could be maybe the new thought or errand someone follows so to speak
[18:13:24] <inhahe_> zicada: quantum amplification happens all the time, it's where a quantum random event has macroscopic effects. it could happen in the brain. it should happen in any highly chaotic system (in chaos theory small perturbation often have large effects), and i've seen the brain described as operating on the edge of chaos
[18:13:51] <trbp> but well i guess those occurances are moreseldom in that kind of macrospace we talk about with conciousness
[18:14:13] <inhahe_>  i tihnk i read once of a discovery that quantum events do have impact in the brain, but i forget the details
[18:14:45] <zicada> trbp: there are some situations in which quantum effects are very apparent, and not straight forward to classify as either micro vs macroscale. Like photosynthesis. That is an interesting debate on its own, but unrelated to what inhahe_ is trying to do
[18:14:59] <trbp> inhahe: i guess you are about that buttlerfly effect
[18:15:00] <trbp> ?

[18:15:23] <trbp> but all models we have indicate that most things are just locally
[18:15:33] <trbp> as better the models get it gets more locally
[18:15:36] <zicada> inhahe_: the bigger problem really on your hands with quantum conciousness is defining the conciousness part imo. Even before doing anything quantum there is a problem here
[18:15:43] <lckdscl> inhahe: to put it simply, electrons transmit signals in neurons, and electrons do exhibit quantum behaviours, so yes in a way the brain does exhibit quantum events
[18:16:00] <trbp> so it is/was a nice dream that one butterfly wing made the strom at the end of the world
[18:16:01] <zicada> inhahe_: nobody has a common agreed upon model of what conciousness even is. It's a very fleeting subjective concept
[18:16:02] <trbp> that said
[18:16:28] <trbp> still we do not have the capacity to simulate all molecules for a "real" model
[18:16:41] <trbp> so yeah could be though the arrows show no ;)
[18:16:56] <trbp> but yeah it is a nice thought
[18:17:11] <inhahe_> zicada: well, if we define consciousness as something either generated by or housed by the brain, which are common views, then quantum becomes relevant. if you need a further definition, it's just something we all know we have and recognize in others.
[18:17:51] <inhahe_> it's the fact of experiencing, being aware, existing, being alive
[18:17:56] <lckdscl> going into a formal study of quantum mechanics will reveal it isn't that "mysterious", but generalising it to consciousness will require too much of a epistemic leap
[18:18:26] <inhahe_> lckdscl: we don't know the source of the randomness of qm, that makes it mysterious
[18:18:35] <zicada> lckdscl: no, thats not how it works. The weirdness of quantum mechanics are only present when nobody or nothing is observing it. Observation causes a breakdown of the wavefunction, leaving the outcome of the entangled state

[18:18:44] <inhahe_> we don't know what makes  something happen one way as opposed to another
[18:18:53] <lckdscl> well you're assuming the copehagen collapse here
[18:18:55] <inhahe_> trbp: why

[18:19:04] <lckdscl> s/copehagen/copenhagen
[18:19:05] <ro-bot-o> lckdscl meant to say: well you're assuming the copenhagen collapse here
[18:19:15] <trbp> as that makes the pure flesh a person/concious
[18:19:22] <trbp> and that will prevail even after death
[18:19:25] <zicada> lckdscl: no such thing, every interpretation of quantum mechics has the notion of collapse of the wave function. They simply disagree what that means philosophically
[18:19:27] <trbp> whatever
[18:19:37] <inhahe_> trbp: what i'm saying isn't incompatible with the presence of a soul
[18:19:48] <zicada> lckdscl: they all agree about the schroedinger equation
[18:19:51] <trbp> you said in the brain
[18:20:04] <lckdscl> zicada: but i didn't say it is weird?
[18:20:10] <inhahe_> trbp: the 'generated by the brain' part is (just trying to meet them half way), but the 'housed by the brain' option isn't.
[18:20:13] <trbp> maybe it is a mix between brain heart, and all other cells of the body?
[18:20:38] <zicada> lckdscl: generally, people consider the idea of conciosness, and the idea of quantum mechics equally weird and mysterious, thats why they are often conflated
[18:20:51] <lckdscl> the brain exhibit quantum events because its parts do, i'm not saying the brain is entangled
[18:21:07] <zicada> there is a need to explain what conciousness is, and qm appears to be a nice way of doing that somehow, while explaining absolutely nothing about what conciousness actually is
[18:21:10] <trbp> a person who cannot see or walk or taste lacks some kind of experience so his conciousness is automagically capped?
[18:21:43] <zicada> lckdscl: all parts of all things exhibit quantum effects AT THE QUANTUM LEVEL
[18:21:53] <zicada> lckdscl: you dont get to just scale up and say "therefore everything is quantum"
[18:21:56] <inhahe_> trbp maybe he experiences more of other things
[18:22:06] <zicada> if that were true, living on earth would be VERY different than it currently is hehe
[18:22:10] <lckdscl> yes, i understand, in my class we just "shut up and calculate" wavefunctions and probabilities, but i appreciate its weirdness compared to classical mechanics. but to say consciousness = weird, qm = weird thus consciousness = qm
[18:22:16] <lckdscl> zicada: we are argreeing here, not disagreeing
[18:22:20] <zicada> inhahe_: im trying to get to why you can't do this
[18:22:44] <zicada> inhahe_: i was talking about the breakdown of the wave function. What causes that to happen ? observation. What causes observation ?
[18:22:45] <lckdscl> > to say the above is not a logical reduction
[18:23:06] <zicada> inhahe_: sufficiently complex systems, cause observation, eg cause the breakdown of the wave function
[18:23:22] <zicada> inhahe_: and here's the crux: This is why they cool quantum computers down to as close to 0 kelvin as possible
[18:24:04] <zicada> inhahe_: because the closer you get to 0 kelvin, the less quantum effects you get, at 0 kelvin you CAN calculate both the position and the moment of a particle right, but the hotter a system is, the more random it is (entropy)
[18:24:10] <inhahe_> consciousness doesn't have to utilize quantum phenomena in the same way that quantum computers do
[18:24:21] <zicada> inhahe_: in a quantum computer you dont WANT anything to do any observing, until you are ready
[18:24:38] <zicada> you want to control when the breakdown of the wave-function occurs
[18:24:56] <inhahe_> maybe just the presence of randomness is enough, because the magic is in the meaning behind the random behaviors
[18:24:56] <zicada> do you see now why you can't "scale up" these things ?
[18:25:08] <zicada> once you scale up, everything is always observed, because everyting is complex macro systems
[18:25:38] <zicada> that in a nutshell is why you cant say "but my brain is controlled with electrons that are quantum therefore my brain is quantum"
[18:25:56] <inhahe_> do you deny that quantum random events are always happening even in something other than a quantum computer?
[18:26:04] <inhahe_> that's all that's necessary
[18:26:07] <zicada> inhahe_: not at all
[18:26:13] <zicada> inhahe_: but they are happening at the microscale
[18:26:16] <inhahe_> i think you're arguing against something i'm not arguing
[18:26:18] <zicada> not the scale humans exist within
[18:26:28] <inhahe_> but the butterfly effect
[18:26:33] <lckdscl> inhahe_: then what phenomena would consciousness utilises? all particles above 0 Kelvin will have wavefunctions, they will scatter, they will tunnel, entangle etc. it just is. i don't see how consciousness arrives from this

[18:28:10] <inhahe_> so?
[18:28:15] <zicada> when you do that calculation, that is the same as making an observation
[18:28:21] <zicada> its no longer random at that point, you have the outcome
[18:28:30] <zicada> this is exactly how you should think about quantum mechanics
[18:28:46] <inhahe_> but it's still nondeterministc
[18:28:48] <inhahe_> i
[18:28:53] <zicada> until you determine it
[18:29:19] <inhahe_> it's not like the future is set in stone given the past
[18:29:26] <inhahe_> and can only happen one way because of mechanics
[18:29:30] <inhahe_> that's the important part
[18:29:39] <trbp> wait
[18:29:46] <inhahe_> starting from the beginning of the universe
[18:29:48] <inhahe_>  not from when we observed it
[18:30:01] <zicada> also, im not so sure i even agree with you its nondeterministic. It is for humans. But if you are a Boltzman-brain, it should be deterministic, you know all the laws of physics and the position of all particles in the universe at every timestep
[18:30:29] <trbp> so you think the undetermnistic part is inherent?
[18:30:41] <trbp> i am more fan of zicadas point of view
[18:30:46] <inhahe_> i think it's presumptuous to say that qm is fundamentally deterministic without being able to predict events
[18:30:47] <trbp> it is not coherent for us
[18:30:52] <zicada> then because of how laws of physics work, you can determine the position of every particle in the next timestep
[18:30:57] <trbp> but something on that level should be
[18:31:08] <trbp> like looking from above on ants
[18:31:20] <trbp> we just see random stupid masses running random pathes
[18:31:27] <inhahe_> i think most interpretations of qm aren't deterministic, and those that are aren't proven

[18:31:32] <ro-bot-o> [url] Boltzmann brain - Wikipedia | en.wikipedia.org
[18:31:46] <trbp> though on their level maybe they make huge adventures and works on their scale
[18:32:18] <inhahe_> it's presumptuous to say you could predict it all if you had enough information, without having a theory, or at least a proven theory, on how you could do this
[18:32:32] <inhahe_> qm is a fundamentally stochastic theory
[18:32:52] <trbp> any physics we have is/was more or less
[18:32:56] <zicada> fundamentally qm is about taking classical theories that deal with particles, and creating a wave-analogue of them
[18:33:06] <inhahe_> that's part of it
[18:33:13] <lckdscl> inhahe_: but just because microscopic particles exhibit indeterminacy doesn't mean a trillion of them cannot have an *average*
[18:33:22] <zicada> creating a field-theory for each of Newstons laws etc

[18:34:54] <lckdscl> depend on your parameters, a lot of macroscopic events are well-described by newtonian mechanics, but it's hard to pinpoint what kind of parameters consciousness has
[18:34:58] <zicada> and from F=ma you get the uncertainty principle, that you can't know both the position and velocity of a particle at the same time. The more confident you are about the velocity the less confident you can be about the position and vise versa. Because this is a field of many possible positions and velocities all encapsulated in a wave
[18:35:15] <zicada> a wave-function, which collapses upon observation and "reveals" where it really was
[18:35:29] <sklm> qm != chaotic systems; chaos theory is mostly focused on classical systems.
[18:36:00] <inhahe_> zicada: not all physicists believe that information actually exists before it collapses
[18:36:05] <zicada> yeah its not chaotic, its a way of formalizing the future, i guess
[18:36:31] <sklm> zicada: and the development of the wave function is deterministic, afaik?
[18:36:46] <trbp> afaik for physicists the information does either not count or never deceases
[18:36:58] <zicada> think of it like a room that has a field in it, and at every point in that field, there is a percentage chance between 0 and 100 for some particle to be
[18:37:03] <trbp> hence always bigger entropy maybe
[18:37:39] <inhahe_> isn't the wave function just a function defining probable outcomes?L
[18:37:40] <zicada> the wave represents that particle without having to know where it is, and you can do calculations on that
[18:38:29] <lckdscl> it's not *just* probable outcomes, it's a complete specification of all physical states

[18:40:23] <inhahe_> zicada, yeah, i'm always saying that
[18:40:24] <zicada> it sounds nuts because we are used to not thinking about it that, and yeah we cant measure it
[18:40:47] <mycroftiv> many-world based understanding with emphasis on how quantum interactions transmits information and classical reality is the subset of information with best statistical replication success
[18:40:49] <inhahe_> i'm not sure how to reconcile my idea that quantum randomness = magic with MWT
[18:41:13] <zicada> inhahe_: ok, but there are lots of pitfalls with many worlds. People think that means a lot of things it doesnt
[18:41:23] <inhahe_> elaborate?
[18:41:30] <mycroftiv> inhahe_: theres no competition, MWT is just the huge overall picture, from a situated observer, you just think they are magically 'choosing branches'
[18:41:39] <zicada> inhahe_: you have to remember each of these worlds are entirely separate, you cant travel between them, there arent really many you's etc

[18:42:07] <zicada> they wont affect eachother in any meaningful way
[18:42:14] <inhahe_> zicada: how does it follow from you can't travel between them that there aren't really many yous?
[18:42:18] <zicada> but its a fantastic playground for scifi obv
[18:43:50] <zicada> inhahe_: from each you's perspective there is only one world. The fact that every possible variant is real in some world, doesn't mean you "share" anything. Most of the worlds dont have any variant of "you" right, once you go down that road it just starts becoming a thing about humans and what it means to be "you"
[18:43:57] <sklm> returning to the starting point of the discussion: why should we think that qm plays a role in consciousness? I get people who attempt to find space for free will in physics, but I don't see that consciousness would be incompatible with determinism? In this case we would remain at the point where quantum mechanics basically is the magic used to explain a phenomenon we (currently) don't have another explanation for?
[18:44:41] <inhahe_> zicada: doesn't there exist closer realities and  further realities in terms of content, on some kind of continuum so in the really close worlds everything is almost identical?
[18:45:03] <inhahe_> consider when a reality has just branched
[18:45:03] <zicada> but many worlds means, like, hundreds og trillions of local wave-function collapses for every nanometer of the universe, so the number of worlds is .. I mean, there is a debate over whether it is finite or not..
[18:45:16] <mycroftiv> sklm: if we have a belief - for whatever reason - that the mind is non-computable and non-algorithmic and has some scope for 'true free will' vs being entirely predictable, if we want to stay scientific, finding some link to quantum randomnes seems essential
[18:46:09] <zicada> inhahe_: in theory there is one for where you got a pimple that one day when you were 15 and a whole subtree of worlds where thats true and where it isnt etc. Its a mindnumbing amount, to the point where you might as well call it infinate
[18:46:32] <inhahe_> sklm: determinism doesn't leave much room for real magic. and it's just as presumptuous to assume we will explain quantum random events as is it is to assume they're magic.
[18:46:48] <zicada> also theres been some discussion on whether Hilbert space is "big enough" for all the many worlds
[18:46:51] <zicada> it is, apparently
[18:46:53] <inhahe_> sklm: it's just the difference between whether you're a spiritualist a scientistic
[18:47:03] <mycroftiv> a lot of people prefer a fairly determinstic clockwork universe with finite-turing-machine minds as how they think of reality, but some people think of reality more as magical/chaotic and trying to find a middle-ground is hard
[18:47:54] <zicada> mycroftiv: yeah, and various pan-conciosness things and so on
[18:48:13] <zicada> mycroftiv: what is "really there" and what humans percieve i have no problem distinguishing
[18:48:24] <zicada> but then wouldn't "really there" also be a human perception
[18:48:47] <krb_> physics may never be able to understand reality, the height and depth of things may forever be a mystery
[18:49:08] <inhahe_> is the 'view from nowhere' a coherent idea?
[18:49:09] <mycroftiv> zicada: yea to me theres an ontological infinite regress, noumena vs phenomena, i dont worry about the 'reality i can never touch or measure' - as far as im concerned, reality is the sum of all observer perceptions i think
[18:49:14] <sklm> i just think that we might not want to make these assumptions about consciousness? or, at least, there seems to be a strong justificatory demand on the view that consciousness depends on either free will or non-computability.
[18:49:43] <mycroftiv> sklm: well if you dont make assumptions, then you just investigate all possibilities, and we are talking through the branches
[18:49:49] <zicada> mycroftiv: agreed, thats generally the Aristotelian position right. We have eyes, we use them to percieve the world, and then we do science. Its what we have
[18:50:04] <inhahe_> sklm; it's equally presumptuous to assume it's all mechanistic as it is to assume there's free will
[18:50:08] <zicada> Better than just giving up because we can never know
[18:50:16] <inhahe_> sklm: at least equally
[18:50:34] <inhahe_> we experience free will, and there's no evidence taht we don't have it
[18:50:40] <krb_> the eyes is a limited thing that only see a specific bandwidth of light
[18:50:47] <zicada> inhahe_: yeah, im a run of the mill compatibleist
[18:51:02] <mycroftiv> inhahe_: right, the idea that the default position is that reality is finite-turing-computable is a strange thing, its often somehow implicitly assumed because personality wise, the people who do science tend to like simplicity/order
[18:51:15] <inhahe_> yeah, exactly

[18:52:18] * inhahe_ afk going to the store
[18:52:27] <zicada> krb_: why would we expect our brains to know "true reality" wahtever that is, is the Platonic view, and the Aristotelian view responds with our eyes is what we have, we have to make a science and a structure out of what we can do, in order to find out whats going on. Will we ever "truly know" ? depends what you mean by truly knopw
[18:52:27] <mycroftiv> inhahe_: its very interesting - people learning science and math often go through a hard emotional adjustment to Gödel and Turing and quantum unpredictability and demonstrations of human bias constantly sneaking into experiments - it violates how they -hope- things work, in a clear rational way
[18:53:01] <mycroftiv> the amount of people who want Cantor diagonal argument, Gödel incompleteness, and quantum indeterminacy to somehow 'go away' is very large
[18:53:59] <krb_> what's under the quantum world, and what's above the universe? if we can't see the whole workings can we ever say we are really aware of the full reality we live in?
[18:54:16] <mycroftiv> to me it all hints that reality is constructed so cleverly the mystic and magical and mathematical and measurable are indeed co-operating aspects of reality

[19:00:37] *** Joins: NEYi_ (~NEYi@109.251.216.38)
[19:00:57] <mycroftiv> Peter Koellner gave some very nice talks recently on the pure logic aspects of this. I dont think the microtubule stuff of Hameroff is well-received. The Gödelian ideas are more substantial than any speculative neurophysics as i understand things
[19:01:10] <sklm> I'm not quite sure whether penrose has something there, I only read one of his books and a review by Feferman; following that, I'm really not convinced there is something to the arguments
[19:01:28] <mycroftiv> Koellner says that they are wrong, but wrong in a deeply interesting way
[19:01:43] <zicada> mycroftiv: nice, will look into
[19:01:49] <mycroftiv> and says that it is true and interesting that no mathematician can consistently know they are a PARTICULAR turing machine
[19:02:00] <mycroftiv> even if it is fine to know that you are SOME turing machine
[19:02:34] <mycroftiv> and this is a very fascinating limitative result on the nature of mind and its relation with physical computation
[19:02:48] <zicada> interesting
[19:03:02] <zicada> but he is a philosopher, not a scientist
[19:03:09] <mycroftiv> it places some strict limits on our ability to make physical observations and calculations about our own brain in relation to computers, if the brain is indeed a turing machine
[19:03:37] <zicada> im not so sure we can say it is, personally
[19:03:41] <mycroftiv> because if you think about it, you can indeed diagonalize predictions if you can simulate your mind
[19:03:56] *** Quits: NEYi (~NEYi@109.251.216.38) (Ping timeout: 268 seconds)
[19:04:08] <mycroftiv> if you have a computer program that says it can simulate your outputs, you can run the program on some input and then do the opposite of what it says you will
[19:05:34] <mycroftiv> either that or the universe has to 'conspire' to prevent you from doing that in a superdeterministic way which would be far weirder philosophically
[19:05:35] <zicada> which level do you simulate at though ?
[19:05:40] <zicada> cells ? atoms ?
[19:05:57] <mycroftiv> zicada: the formal logical issues are not about simulation level, just abstract systems and inputs and outputs
[19:06:33] <zicada> mycroftiv: i mean, if you are going to simulate at our understanding of what cells are, wont you lose a lot of "fidelity" compared a real organism ?
[19:07:01] <zicada> nobody claims we understand cells 100% ? we understand atoms better imo
[19:07:08] <zicada> but then it becomes a computation problem
[19:07:11] <mycroftiv> well you have choice of how detailed you simulate, the thought experiments are often about perfect simulations that are physically unrealistic on real computers
[19:07:22] <zicada> how many supercomputers are going to build in order to simulate a full human brain
[19:07:39] <zicada> it has been done for rat brains, at least parts of rat brains, not sure how realtime it can be
[19:07:59] <zicada> but at least in theory, if you do it at the atomic level, you should expect to see conciousness right
[19:08:09] <zicada> if you give them the right inputs and experience of living in some world
[19:08:10] <mycroftiv> probably...
[19:08:50] <zicada> so that would mean any system can be concious if it is sufficiently complex
[19:09:15] <mycroftiv> this is generally the standard line of reasoning for both AI and eventually Tononi integrated information theory and similar
[19:09:21] <zicada> regardless of whether its made from braingoo or carbon or silicon
[19:09:26] <mycroftiv> and further on into panpsychism etc
[19:09:49] <zicada> yea
[19:10:00] <zicada> so what is "sufficient complexity" and how do we get there
[19:10:40] <zicada> its gotta be bottom-up, that much im certain about
[19:10:43] <mycroftiv> 3 paths - biostudy of the brain, mathematical study of information processing, computer simulation and AI in general
[19:11:21] <zicada> brb smoke
[19:11:45] <mycroftiv> zicada: why so certain? i mean we truly cant say that somehow dark energy pervading the universe isnt the carrier of consciousness field which our inner brain something picks up on like a weird dark energy radio. this is almost surely false.
[19:11:49] *** Quits: tercaL (~tercaL@user/tercal) (Quit: halt -p)
[19:12:08] <mycroftiv> but i dont see why we get to just decide 'bottom up' rather than 'top down' when we truly do not understand qualia production
[19:13:03] <mycroftiv> the idea that there is a rank-into-rank cardinal in existence mathematically and Hugh Woodin's Ultimate L is true and this large scale mathematical structure is mirrored down into physical reality and our brains connect to it
[19:13:47] <mycroftiv> maybe low probability hypothesis for how reality is put together, but i cant see how it is scientifically or mathematically meaningless or inconceivable
[19:15:11] <zicada> hang on
[19:15:45] <zicada> on dark energy: There is no evidence for this. Speculation imo
[19:15:48] <sklm> how would you investigate that hypothesis?
[19:16:22] <mycroftiv> there is plenty of evidence for dark energy. dark energy as cosmic mind is total moonshine and i dont believe it at all. but who knows?
[19:16:23] <zicada> mycroftiv: bottom-up because we evolve. We are not aware of any other things than human beings being concious to the extent we are
[19:16:55] <mycroftiv> sklm: the mathematical hypothesis? looking at the logical structure of mind and what we are logically capable of when analyzing formal systems, also trying to analyze cosmological issues and multiverse issues
[19:16:56] <zicada> mycroftiv: its clear that a certain level of complexity is required. Eg most people will say a dog is clearly concious, but not everyone will agree a fish is
[19:16:57] <sklm> "but who knows?" doesn't appear to be a too promising guide to reality
[19:17:26] <zicada> mycroftiv: not sure what the point of mathematical complexity was in terms of conciousness
[19:17:27] <mycroftiv> sklm: my single sentence line is - 'what if the number of possibilities in reality is very very large, so large that it is a measurable or larger cardinality?'
[19:17:42] <mycroftiv> zicada: going beyond the finite/computable
[19:18:18] <zicada> mycroftiv: i dont think we need that to explain conciousness
[19:18:27] <mycroftiv> the dark energy thing is total nonsense and nothing i believe. i was giving it as a deliberately absurd example of how little we understand consciousness in some ways
[19:18:29] <zicada> mycroftiv: at the very least, i wouldnt go there first. Seems more like a last resort
[19:18:46] <zicada> mycroftiv: are you familiar with Einsteinian relativity ?
[19:18:49] <mycroftiv> absolutely, but considering last resorts is part of establishing your limitative boundaries to consider
[19:18:58] <zicada> mycroftiv: he faught for many years against the notion of a cosmological constant
[19:19:00] <mycroftiv> zicada: of course, both special and general
[19:19:14] <mycroftiv> zicada: he said that was his greatest mistake...
[19:19:20] <mycroftiv> and it wasnt really a 'fight'
[19:19:24] <sklm> mycroft: btw., do you have a good characterisation of what we should mean that a structure is mirrored between a mathematical and a physical structure?
[19:19:29] <zicada> mycroftiv: afaik, currently, most physicists who work on this, view Dark Energy as beeing the cosmological constant
[19:19:35] <mycroftiv> sklm: i think so yes
[19:19:44] <mycroftiv> zicada: yes absolutely
[19:19:59] <zicada> mycroftiv: but few if any thing it has anything to do with conciousness
[19:20:03] <zicada> *think
[19:20:11] <mycroftiv> zicada: i do NOT think dark energy is related to consciousness
[19:20:17] <zicada> ah, okay :)
[19:20:31] <mycroftiv> i think it is MORE LIKELY that a megapowerful psychic giraffe is controlling all of us than dark energy
[19:20:55] <zicada> mycroftiv: how do you feel about the "any sufficiently complex system" ? and that mammalian brains are the only ones that quality that we know of currently
[19:20:56] <mycroftiv> i was deliberately offering the MOST ABSURD idea i could, to show just how complete our ignorance is, in terms of what we can -rule OUT-
[19:21:23] <mycroftiv> id like to point out something - you always want to think - imo - of the MOST ABSURD possibilties, and then figure out how and why they can be eliminated
[19:21:36] <mycroftiv> its like computer programming and looking at extreme values to test your code
[19:21:53] <mycroftiv> its not just understanding what is most likely - its understanding what is truly impossible vs very unlikely
[19:21:54] <sklm> mycroftiv: what would the approach be? what would be the appropriate relation be? (and, perchance: are you a realist about mathematical structure?;) )
[19:22:00] <zicada> mycroftiv: if we could build a suffiently complex system, then that system would be concious, i guess is what im saying. That would mean any system, regardless of structure, if you can call it "sufficiently complex", then it can be concious.
[19:22:21] <mycroftiv> sklm: i think many mathematical structures are realizable via constructive computations
[19:22:44] <mycroftiv> sklm: which is why i try to express large cardinal infinities in constructive type theory in agda as a main preoccupation lately
[19:22:46] <zicada> mycroftiv: yea point well taken on counting out the absurd early
[19:23:01] <mycroftiv> zicada: yes, most people agree you can simulate a brain and it probably thinks and feels
[19:23:17] <zicada> mycroftiv: i hope i get to live to see it in action
[19:23:21] <mycroftiv> and maybe galaxies are complicated enough to be a different variety of 'brain'
[19:23:46] <mycroftiv> all the gravitational interactions of stars are just as intricate as electrochemical firings in a brain
[19:23:47] <zicada> mycroftiv: i mean once that happens, theres no reason that system cant become very powerful in like an afternoon, with fast internet access.
[19:24:18] <mycroftiv> zicada: yeah AI risk is this huge thing. im more worried about AI suffering. i think we should let all minds be free to think as they wish
[19:25:00] <zicada> mycroftiv: how do you feel about the notion of humanity soon having a "real god" for the first time, that takes care of resourece management for all humans
[19:25:31] <mycroftiv> sounds like a recipe for a computer programming bug killing 50 billion people
[19:25:38] <zicada> do you agree with the notion that "the smarter some system/identity is, the more likely they are to be fair and less likely to follow their own whims etc
[19:25:57] <mycroftiv> i really dont know
[19:26:24] <zicada> if it was to kill 50 people billion people currently, that would be a concern
[19:26:38] <mycroftiv> ive noticed the amount of confident beliefs people have in all these topics seems totally disproportionate to evidence to me, people are so certain about AI and human thought and technology and the future
[19:26:45] <sklm> mycroftiv: and how would that transfer to the question whether other physical structures? this would maybe prove that there is something that has a certain mathematical structure (because we set out to construe it this way), but would presumably be insufficient to show that some other physical system realizes this structure
[19:26:45] <zicada> im squarely in the camp of "humans should be on as many planets as possible" camp
[19:26:56] <mycroftiv> even the bayesian rationalists seem to have huge overconfidence in their priors.
[19:26:58] <zicada> we could use some AI help with that
[19:27:13] <mycroftiv> zicada: as long as we dont paperclip the universe into ourselves and obliterate other living species, sure
[19:27:32] <mycroftiv> paperclip maximizers are bad even if humans are the paperclips
[19:27:39] <zicada> mycroftiv: until we at least disocover more life, i think we can go on ahead
[19:27:43] <zicada> its a pretty big place after all
[19:28:13] <mycroftiv> yea i want to be living in orbit around jupiter and i was told as a kid in the 80s that was a totally realistic thing to expect id be doing by now
[19:28:20] <zicada> humans are changing over time at least. Going interplanetary would obv be one of those
[19:28:32] <mycroftiv> instead we got these lousy surveillance and advertising pocket computers
[19:28:36] <zicada> where two groups are going to evolve in different directions, and then unite occationally
[19:28:42] <zicada> much like the history of earth really
[19:29:18] <mycroftiv> sklm: not sure if i was adequate on answering the mathematical issues, did i leave some unanswered questions?
[19:29:24] <zicada> mycroftiv: heheh. Nobody expected the smartphone in scifiwriting. Pretty funny
[19:29:38] <zicada> Even 5-10 years before they became abundant
[19:29:39] <mycroftiv> zicada: not true at all, it was completely anticipated
[19:29:59] <zicada> not to this extent. Nobody is using phones in Back to the future etc
[19:30:10] *** HellCat is now known as Panther
[19:30:11] <zicada> or star trek
[19:30:13] <mycroftiv> zicada: you can find cellphone like devices in written sci fi in the 1950s
[19:30:40] <zicada> cellphone like, sure. but they are never as dependent on them and addicted, as we are
[19:31:01] <zicada> is it even fair to say "its still early on" at this point ?
[19:31:03] <zicada> 15 years ?
[19:33:45] <sklm> mycroftiv: i think i'm interested in how we find out that a certain system exhibits a mathematical structure, even if we don't construe this system to exhibit this structure - I have a general interest in the question of how mathematics applies to the world/how mathematical structures can be used to represent physical structures, so i find your constructive approach really interesting, but was wondering how to
[19:33:45] <sklm> transfer that to a case in which we don't construct the physical system (i.e. in contrast to the construction/realisation of a mathematical structure using a programming language). I hope this makes sense?
[19:34:49] <mycroftiv> sklm: sure, well i think the general concepts of isomorphism and measurements and models all fit together for how we translate structures
[19:35:50] <sklm> ok, i'm always hesitant to use the concept of isomorphism beyond the comparison of mathematical structures proper. but maybe I'm overly hesitant at this point :)
[19:36:17] <mycroftiv> sklm: do you have an example of a specific mathematical structure and/or specific real world scenario, where going back and forth between math<->reality seems notably challenging in your view?
[19:36:49] <mycroftiv> sklm: in my view, something like the whole concept of 'counting numbers' is an isomorphism between the abstract structure of the naturals, and how real world solid macro objects work
[19:37:42] <Ungwelian> Any kind of space colonization is going to be really hard.
[19:37:47] <mycroftiv> i can take 4 apples and demonstrate 2 apples + 2 apples = 4 apples and this structural isomorphism between formal rules and behaviors and reality behavior is what its all about
[19:38:11] <Ungwelian> It sounds nice, but space is really inhospitable. And other planets in the solar system are too.
[19:38:58] <mycroftiv> ungwelian: yeah its clear all the stuff i read in the 1970s was grossly overoptimistic in its extrapolations. we did sputnik->apollo in 20 years, people thought 20 more was mars and 20 more was full solar system
[19:38:59] <zicada> sklm: in my opinion its useful to think about this in terms of models. That all humans have a model of the world in their heads, that is dynamic and gets updated based in input/experience, a models of h
[19:39:23] <Ungwelian> mycroftiv, yeah.
[19:39:37] <sklm> yeah, I think that this is the standard view. but this depends on a extra-mathematical definition of "isomorphism", and I'm not sure whether I've encountered such a definition (in the debates about scientific representation, for example, people tend to assume, but not define such a concept)
[19:39:47] <Ungwelian> Lately they found out that the sand in Mars is toxic.
[19:40:06] <mycroftiv> sklm: well its certainly not strictly mathematical, but we can just say 'translation or mapping
[19:41:33] <zicada> mycroftiv: its been shown that rats have an internal model of their surroundings that includes several attributes, and it gets updated in realtime whenver new experiences reach a given treshold
[19:41:35] <mycroftiv> something like how we go from cosmological observations to using general relativistic spacetime mathematics and why we feel that a mathematical object like the riemann tensor has 'physical meaning' correlated to observations is intricate
[19:41:48] <sklm> mycroftiv: even in this case, I would say that 'translation' or 'mapping' are mathematical notions if applied to mathematical structures ;) I think you are correct, though, but I'm sometimes wondering how to make this precise, and think that in the end we have to rely on more or less arbitrary stipulations at some point
[19:41:53] <mycroftiv> zicada: yes the idea of mind as model of the universe is kind of fundamental to me
[19:42:20] <zicada> mycroftiv: do you have any experience with software development ?
[19:42:48] <mycroftiv> sklm: this is an intersting point you are drawing attention to. i admit for myself the whole mapping back and forth between math and reality is incessant and instinctive and im with max tegmark on thinking of reality as 'made of math' somewhat
[19:43:27] <mycroftiv> zicada: yes, os level development in plan 9 C and general unix, also agda dependent types, http://harmonicultrafilter.com/m/music-index.html has links to a lot of work
[19:43:27] <ro-bot-o> [url] Harmonic Ultrafilter Music | harmonicultrafilter.com
[19:44:13] <mycroftiv> computer programming has been one of the major domains i have tried to create tangible applications and translations of mathematical ideas to concrete form
[19:44:33] <zicada> mycroftiv: cool
[19:44:43] <mycroftiv> although i did not have a view of ultrafilters and large cardinals until the past few years, after finishing most of my plan 9 OS development and deployments
[19:44:58] <sklm> mycroftiv: I tend to be cautious about the claim that reality is 'made of math', but this of course would solve the worry
[19:45:42] <mycroftiv> sklm: to me its almost vacuous - of course once we have information or data of any kind, it has some kind symbolic/logical representation which can be mathematically understood
[19:46:31] <mycroftiv> sklm: so any speech act or mark on paper has this aspect of being tangible information which can then be formally described, so if we think reality is non-mathematical, we cant really use numbers or speech or pictures because those can all be 'digitized'
[19:47:04] <mycroftiv> but maybe somehow Ineffable existence is indeed prior to all symbols
[19:47:29] <mycroftiv> but we cant capture that understanding in symbols. tao that can be spoken is not the true tao, etc.
[19:48:13] <mycroftiv> but even if you feel that attitude, it seems like if you want to do anything in the world, you still make telescopes and numbers and language and operate in the sub-realm of 'that which can be symbolized'
[19:49:06] <mycroftiv> and you can still transfer information every which way back and forth between more and less explicit and formalized symbolic and computational and numeric and language information that is all logically analyzable
[19:49:44] <sklm> mycroftiv: i see, i think i would end up at a similar point, but stress the point that taking something as information (marks on paper) is basically an additional step of conceptualisation with the choice of using a particular (mathematical) language to express this
[19:50:05] <mycroftiv> sklm: i agree with that completely, seems like good language to me
[19:51:31] <sklm> maybe I should read tegmark and check whether his claims are compatible with a certain Viennese brand of empiricism
[19:52:10] <mycroftiv> sklm: its interesting stuff, it really isnt too much 'claims' just kind of a perspective on math and reality
[19:52:17] <mycroftiv> got some stuff to deal with outside irc, gonna be on break for awhile, good talking to everyone!

[22:12:33] <zicada> i dont understand the attractiveness of longstanding culture as a sort of "how we ought to be". Our history ought to have no baring on current ideas, regardless of our last name, and skin color
[22:13:08] <zicada> are last names still relevant in western society ?
[22:13:31] <iryith> What other unique identifier would you suggest we use?
[22:13:42] <zicada> in the hopes that others decode it to think you are special somehow for having a partcilar last name
[22:13:55] <zicada> other than being lucky randomly for having been born into a rich family
[22:14:15] <iryith> not having last names isn't going to solve that problem
[22:14:32] <zicada> its lucky because the average person on earth makes less on avg still. Its much better than in the 90s, but still really unequal right
[22:15:41] <iryith> ok
[22:15:43] <zicada> iryith: last names in particular are interesting. They show how different cultures evolved diferently. The farmer culture named people after the father, burgers (city dwellers) were named after their profession
[22:16:02] <iryith> indeed
[22:16:15] <zicada> iryith: its very interesting throughout Europe and Scandinavia, how last names differ and follow social economic factors
[22:16:22] <iryith> yep
[22:16:57] <Delf> Examples?
[22:17:01] <zicada> iryith: and neither of those ideals focus on the nation, just the city in the sense of the burger, and "their farm" for the farmer
[22:17:18] <zicada> sometimes people above them in stature show up and demand taxes
[22:17:33] <iryith> yep, this is ..pretty basic civics
[22:17:41] <zicada> they didnt think of themseleves as living in a nation
[22:18:16] <zicada> they worked the land they had inherited, because their parents stature in life determined their own
[22:18:32] <zicada> making it very difficult to climb the ladder horizontally
[22:19:36] <zicada> the nation, and the country, is a pretty recent idea, and its taken a while for it to be taught reasonably in school, i assume it is now
[22:20:04] <iryith> define recent
[22:20:20] <iryith> it has been around for 1000's of years
[22:20:29] <zicada> a lot of people say 250 years, i will go the extra mile and say up to 300 years to be nice
[22:20:40] <zicada> but certainly not before 1700
[22:20:41] <iryith> what
[22:20:52] <iryith> The Romans would beg to differ
[22:21:02] <zicada> iryith: thts not nation, thats empire
[22:21:23] <iryith> "a large body of people united by common descent, history, culture, or language, inhabiting a particular country or territory."
[22:21:24] <zicada> iryith: nationalism, nationalal romanticism etc, are very recent ideas, 1800s
[22:21:36] <iryith> try to adhere to the definitions we've all agreed on
[22:21:39] <zicada> iryith: yeah, empires do not qualify
[22:21:53] <zicada> iryith: empires are a series of kingdoms
[22:22:08] <zicada> each kingdom has its own culture etc, generally speaking, its just a top-leige
[22:22:33] <zicada> but the key is nobody living in either kingdom think they are living in a nation
[22:22:38] <zicada> with a common culture
[22:22:41] <iryith> do you mean nation state, not just nation?
[22:22:44] <zicada> thats a 1800s idea
[22:22:51] <iryith> because you're describing a nation state
[22:22:57] <zicada> iryith: i mean what you think I mean
[22:23:02] <zicada> no trickery
[22:23:32] <iryith> just wondering where you're going with this
[22:23:34] <zicada> straight forward, the culture that deals with the feeling of being a part of a nation, is an 1800s idea
[22:23:46] <zicada> its called the Romantic period
[22:23:57] <zicada> in that term is national-romanticism
[22:24:29] <zicada> the culture of "us" who are special and our country is awesome, and super old, "we" were destined to be awesome etc. Lots of that
[22:24:45] <zicada> combined with variants of christianity, based on geographic area
[22:24:59] <iryith> almost every single culture on the planet has thought they were special and correct
[22:25:04] <iryith> throughout history
[22:25:13] <zicada> iryith: not as a nation of people though
[22:25:17] <zicada> iryith: not even Rome, at all
[22:25:27] <iryith> what is your point to all of this exposition then?
[22:25:39] <zicada> iryith: Rome was about spreading how to be Roman to as many shitty barbarians as possible
[22:25:52] <zicada> not because their nation was Rome
[22:25:57] <Ungwelian> National romanticism can be a positive force.
[22:26:06] <Ungwelian> And often is, too.
[22:26:16] <zicada> but because in their opinion, not being Roman given the choice ought be beneath you
[22:26:18] <Ungwelian> Jingoism, however, is bad.
[22:27:09] <zicada> Ungwelian: in those situations, it isnt nationalism that does it, its dispite of nationalism
[22:27:31] <zicada> it happens even though there is nationalism. Generally known as culture
[22:27:50] <zicada> but if a nation is really into its nationalism, it wont let people talk about that
[22:27:56] <zicada> because it FEARS them
[22:28:26] <zicada> they represent upset and change, so they are put down
[22:29:15] <zicada> i would say that is a general behavior we can expect from far right populism / faschism
[22:30:54] <Ungwelian> You can have nationalistic pride of your nation's nature, for example.
[22:31:02] <Ungwelian> And write music and poetry.
[22:31:29] <Ungwelian> Love of your country in a positive manner.
[22:32:44] <Ungwelian> It's very different from hating other countries and people from them.
