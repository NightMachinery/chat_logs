[00:45:59] <gwern> well, now. that also means that if you're trying to investigate, you may get a false negative...
[00:46:33] <ggreer> I assume they used a model s with the same software version. teslas don't auto update

[01:10:14] <ggreer> a miata is much lighter than a BMW sedan. compare cars of similar class
[01:10:14] <spxtr> interesting
[01:10:22] <galambo> miata is obviously a very different car
[01:10:30] *** Quits: src (~src@user/src) (Quit: Leaving)
[01:10:47] <ggreer> the miata has gotten much heavier over the years. safety regulations have forced them to add weight
[01:11:03] <galambo> I think most of the weight of the tesla is in the base so it shouldnt affect handling as badly as the weight sounds
[01:12:44] <ggreer> cyclists should be more worried about EVs because they're quieter (though now they have to make noise at low speeds) and they can accelerate much more quickly than gas cars
[01:13:04] <ggreer> that said, the lack of engine in the front tends to make them better for pedestrian collisions
[01:13:16] <spxtr> they're only quieter at low speeds. past some 25 mph or so the wheel noise is much more important than the engine
[01:13:25] <galambo> ggreer, but then most cars are suvs so more people are getting badly injured
[01:13:30] <ggreer> the front is usually more sloped so you can see better. it also means people won't get trapped underneath
[01:16:07] <spxtr> generally cars in europe are much smaller, so a tesla in europe is much heavier than the average non-tesla car

[04:29:38] <TheWhisper> > In 2010, Chris Voigt, the Executive Director of the Washington State Potatoes Commission, vowed to eat nothing but 20 plain potatoes (and a small amount of cooking oil) for 60 days straight to demonstrate that potatoes are perfectly healthy, and in fact nutritious enough to sustain a person for quite a while. This wasn‚Äôt intended as a weight loss diet ‚Äî in fact, 20 potatoes a day was the amount he calculated he would need to maintain his
[04:29:38] <TheWhisper>  weight (2,200 calories). Despite this, Voigt lost 21 pounds over his sixty-day diet. He even had trouble eating enough ‚Äî he just wasn‚Äôt very hungry.
[04:31:32] <nshepperd2> potatoes truly are the miracle fruit
[04:33:08] <TheWhisper> The more I read about water supply, the more I think it's wild that everyone doesn't have a water filtration system in their home
[04:33:19] <TheWhisper> The government should be handing them out like candy
[04:33:57] <nshepperd2> seems more efficient to have one big water filtration system for everyone
[04:34:07] <TheWhisper> Clearly it doesn't work well
[04:35:14] <TheWhisper> I moved into a new home recently and did a water quality test soon after. Here are the top 10 contaminants: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/gzxne8xoegljzz9/2021-10-21_19-04-45.png

[04:35:25] <TheWhisper> And I get public water from "one big water filtration system"
[04:36:40] <TheWhisper> To be fair, the top three contaminants are actually byproducts of the "big water filtration system". e.g. Bromodichloromethane is formed when chlorine reacts with stuff in the water in the filtration plant

The film made use of many innovative techniques, such as coating a watertight camera's lens with a special submarine periscope cleaner, so the camera could be submerged and lifted out of the water without any drops on the lens or film. At
[06:14:17] <feepbot> one point, more than 1,000 Cuban soldiers were moved to a remote location to shoot one scene‚Äîthis despite the then-ongoing Cuban Missile Crisis. In another scene, the camera follows a flag over a body, held high on a stretcher, along a crowded street. Then it stops and slowly moves upwards for at least four storeys until it is filming the flagged body from above a building.
[06:14:17] <feepbot> Without stopping, it then starts tracking sideways and enters through a window into a cigar factory, then goes straight towards a rear window where the cigar workers are watching the procession. The camera finally passes through the window and appears to float along over the middle of the street between the buildings. These shots were accomplished by the camera operator having the
[06:14:22] <feepbot> camera attached to his vest‚Äîlike an early, crude version of a Steadicam‚Äîand the camera operator also wearing a vest with hooks on the back.

[08:13:00] <PapuaHardyNet> I'll have to read up on this
[08:13:33] <saturn2> nihilism doesn't particularly have anything to do with being fucked
[08:14:24] <PapuaHardyNet> yeah, I just realized it based on a cursory read of IEP
[08:14:59] <PapuaHardyNet> that line of thinking isn't even nietzschean, since the value judgement of "I'm fucked" isn't a part of it.
[08:15:32] <PapuaHardyNet> actually, I don't think any philosophy has the value judgement of "we are fucked" as a part of it. Perhaps Benetar and negative utilitarianism
[08:15:59] <PlanckWalk> Well, negative utilitarianism is "try to be least fucked"
[08:18:43] <saturn2> existentialism is the closest thing i know of to "I'm fucked anyway, let's just do our best"

[09:30:09] <rsaarelm> Practicing psychometricians probably assume you don't really want people to practice for IQ tests, so the setup would have to be a bit perverse to begin with.
[09:30:35] <Gurkenglas> right but when i want to figure out whether something increases iq i need to know how much to expect by default
[09:32:26] <rsaarelm> I guess the Flynn effect stuff would be a starting point, but it feels like nobody has made much sense of the Flynn effect...
[09:32:34] <LeoTal> I mean, "an individual commenter decided‚Ä¶" wouldn't be worth mentioning; I'm sort of amused at the consistency in judgement
[09:33:30] <Gurkenglas> in this case, as https://www.spreeder.com/app.php?intro=1 removes subvocalization I wrote a reddit comment on how one might remove internal monologue by going "They thing the thing with the thing to thing the thing at the thing." without changing the meaning of one's thoughts; and then one should probably do an IQ test before and after.

[14:29:42] <feep[work]> yeah it's a really good concept
[14:29:48] <Obormot\Arcturus> Er, is it actually an asymmetric weapon? The Sword, I mean?
[14:29:57] <Obormot\Arcturus> Isn't it actually explicitly *symmetric*?
[14:30:10] <feep[work]> well, it's opinionated
[14:30:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yes, but its opinions don't actually have anything to do with whether what you're doing has good or bad outcomes
[14:30:43] <feep[work]> but it's not asymmetric in the sense of "asymmetric weapons", no
[14:30:58] <feep[work]> I just use the term because I think the term in itself is *more* descriptively powerful than the way the story portrays it
[14:31:13] <feep[work]> ie. the Sword of Good in "Sword of Good" is imo not actually, per se, a "Sword of Good."
[14:32:13] <feep[work]> Obormot\Arcturus: though to be fair, it's possible that the sword is a sword of good but also so powerful that even with good skewed in, it's not *recognizeably weak* if wielded in the service of evil.
[14:32:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> The whole point of the story is that if you think that what you've got is a Sword of Good, consider that maybe it's actually not that, but instead of a Sword of Being Totally Symmetric With Respect To Actual Good or Bad
[14:32:43] <feep[work]> no because then there's no point to making the *sword have an opinion*.
[14:32:49] <Obormot\Arcturus> Disagree

[17:00:20] <feep[work]> let's call it a high-variance strategy.
[17:00:28] <pompolic> i think that's a fair definition

[17:02:13] <pompolic> another acid-insight: i have a rough sense for when my brain is doing an iterative process. such as turning the crank on a repetitive train of thought. i noticed that without trying to otherwise influence it, on acid it was doing it longer

The antibody responses in the participants given 10 ¬µg doses were comparable to those recorded in a previous Pfizer-BioNTech study in people 16 to 25 years of a
[17:04:24] <two2thehead> ge immunized with 30 ¬µg doses. The 10 ¬µg dose was carefully selected as the preferred dose for safety, tolerability and immunogenicity in children 5 to 11 years of age. These are the first results from a pivotal trial of a COVID-19 vaccine in this age group"

[17:36:19] <feepbot> feep: pompolic left a note 14 minutes, 50 seconds ago: was this the followup post you mentioned? https://nostalgebraist.tumblr.com/post/131760475939/some-comments-after-finishing-the-northern-caves
[17:36:33] <feep> pompolic: I've been thinking about it all the way home, and I have THEORIES
[17:36:58] <feep> pompolic: okay, let me quickly retrace my steps
[17:36:58] <LeoTal> I am learning how to use ffmpeg. I shall use this knowledge exclusively to make deep-fried videos with the text "Buttocks"
[17:37:06] <feep> nice
[17:37:20] <feep> pompolic: first, the obvious comparison is ofc with breakdown of bicameral consciousness
[17:38:08] <feep> note how the jungian shadow is said to be a separate personality to which we attribute parts of ourselves that we don't like; obvious conclusion: attributing parts to selfhood is a process, the process can be disrupted
[17:38:31] <feep> another obvious link, ziz and deliberately induced split-brain states
[17:39:04] <feep> but anyway, to cut half an hour of thinking short, here's my theory: selby is writing from the lived first-person perspective of an unconscious sub-agent
[17:42:13] *** Quits: voltage_ (voltage@user/voltage) (Quit: Leaving)
[17:44:18] *** Joins: voltage_ (voltage@user/voltage)
[17:45:09] <feep> in that view, salbian introspective state is just anti-flow.
[17:46:09] <feep> I'm not sure how a human would get their primary awareness in such a state, maybe it's a thing where motivation and goodness get shadowed off?
[17:46:15] <pompolic> interesting
[17:46:42] <pompolic> i think there's in fact something fucky going on with the self-other boundary with people like Ziz
[17:47:42] <pompolic> "lived first-person perspective of an unconscious sub-agent" is interesting
[17:47:59] <feep> I don't think it fits perfectly, but it's the closest thing I've found yet
[17:48:20] <pompolic> ok so yet another personal anecodte
[17:48:22] <pompolic> anecdote
[17:48:56] <feep> also I've reasoned my way through and I think I'm safe from this.
[17:50:03] <pompolic> i mentioned i had a period of stress, right. it's a bit hard to remember but one of the reasons was that it was very easy to drive me into bouts of anxiety by, hmm, lying?
[17:50:21] <feep> that is very relatable, continue
[17:50:25] <pompolic> well, lying or saying shit from which i concluded the person was not entirely truthful to me
[17:50:38] <feep> <pompolic> USO DA!!!!
[17:51:15] <pompolic> this i conceptualized by something like attempted mind control, but i did not literally believe it was mind control
[17:51:24] <feep> no yeah that makes perfect sense
[17:51:29] <pompolic> more like "oh no i'm being manipulated!!! I'm completely defenseless against manipulation!!!"
[17:51:33] <feep> mind martial arts
[17:51:52] <feep> no actually-- mind control is a good term for it
[17:52:07] <pompolic> if you completely lack boundaries yes
[17:52:10] <pompolic> but you don't
[17:52:13] <feep> I mean
[17:52:27] <LeoTal> I tried the split-brain thing once (well, thrice, but once I just fell asleep and the other I got no results) and I do get amusingly slurring thoughts but no significant personality changes
[17:52:34] *** Joins: adiabatic (~adiabatic@user/adiabatic)
[17:53:00] <pompolic> i had noticed that i had been massively confused about where my boundaries lie (both in the sense of "what i think is okay to do to me" and "what i think is me and not-me")
[17:53:10] <feep> pompolic: purely as a matter of mechanism, like, you take a person as a system and you back-engineer a series of inputs from a desired target state or action
[17:53:20] <pompolic> oh yeah
[17:53:23] <pompolic> that's just twitter
[17:53:30] <feep> right but it's also mind control, just in the sense of control theory
[17:53:33] *** Quits: voltage_ (voltage@user/voltage) (Ping timeout: 265 seconds)
[17:53:40] <feep> mind pid
[17:53:54] <pompolic> less shitpostingly but still shitpostingly, i think a lot of people use language for the effects it has on the target's state
[17:54:02] <feep> I mean, all language use is that way
[17:54:04] <pompolic> fnords are probably relevant
[17:54:13] <pompolic> yeah ok
[17:54:33] <feep> like, if I say "all language use is that way"; I say it so that your brain associates the concepts "language use" and "effect targeting"
[17:54:44] <feep> or rather, so that it constructs a compound concept of the two
[17:55:06] <feep> I do this because I have such a concept in my head and I want to give it to you~
[17:55:11] <pompolic> i think something is missing from that model
[17:55:21] <feep> no I know
[17:55:29] <pompolic> when you think of the shannon-weaver model of communication, i would extend it with message types
[17:55:33] <feep> I think it's first-order and second-order changes
[17:55:36] <pompolic> kind of like uhhhhh
[17:55:41] <pompolic> multiple data planes?
[17:55:45] <feep> I know the model
[17:56:02] <pompolic> e.g. a message may have semantic content, affective content, etc
[17:56:08] <pompolic> i think these are just multiplexed together
[17:56:19] <feep> but like, some of this is absolutely northern caves style mundus, right? part of rationality is ... like, that's why I think it's rationality related
[17:56:27] <feep> there is an objectively right way for concepts to click together
[17:56:29] <pompolic> i think fnords are when a message is almost entirely affective content (aimed at getting the recipient in a desired state)
[17:57:03] <pompolic> what do you mean? i think i went off on a tangent with shannon-weaver
[17:57:13] <feep> I think the focus on affective content makes sense
[17:57:15] <pompolic> i think i still don't quite understand the referent of "mundus"
[17:57:20] <feep> pompolic: like, rationalists cannot agree to disagree, right?
[17:57:27] <pompolic> yes

[17:57:38] <feep> [14:08] <pompolic> https://alisonair.wordpress.com/2020/04/23/the-face-of-obligation/ was the post about northern caves mentioned this? I haven't read it yet, but i fished it out of the collective internet unconscious today
[17:57:39] <Robomot> The Face of Obligation ‚Äì The Light Supernal (The Northern Caves is a 51,787 word original story published on the fiction repository site Archive Of Our Own. It is the second most important text ever written.)
[17:57:42] <feep> this is the followup I meant
[17:57:51] <pompolic> ah, ty
[17:58:05] <feep> but so like, to take aumann seriously, you have to believe that
[17:58:19] <feep> like, there is an objectively correct set of states for two rationalists' heads to be in when they interact, and it is identical
[17:58:25] <pompolic> oh
[17:58:29] <pompolic> yeah, i think so
[17:58:31] <feep> this is fundamentally indistinguishable from the salbian perception
[17:58:40] <pompolic> hmm, hold on
[17:59:10] <pompolic> does it imply that your entire world-model becomes identical? 
[17:59:14] <feep> yes.
[17:59:18] <feep> well, at the limit.
[17:59:37] <pompolic> that seems to be the logical extreme of aumann's agreement theorem, but seems practically infeasible
[17:59:42] <feep> correct.
[17:59:55] <feep> but like, nobody is actually doing this.
[18:00:06] <pompolic> aye
[18:00:06] <feep> I just want to introduce the *concept* of conceptual convergence for later in the talk.
[18:00:15] <feep> I suspect it will be handy.
[18:00:24] <pompolic> yeah i think i've cached the necessary context, go on
[18:00:30] <feep> you were talking I think?
[18:00:38] <feep> okay, hang on
[18:00:41] <feep> lemme backtrack
[18:00:47] <pompolic> no rush
[18:00:52] <feep> I think we went off tangent at mind control
[18:00:57] <pompolic> i think so as well
[18:01:01] <pompolic> let's shelve that
[18:01:04] <feep> right and like ... mind contr-- aaa
[18:01:11] <pompolic> oh? well go on
[18:01:17] <feep> I think the difference is that the goal of mind control is explicitly anti-aumannian
[18:01:37] <pompolic> i think i see what you mean
[18:01:45] <feep> you're constructing a shape in the victim's brain, but the shape is not the convergent shape and not a subset of the convergent shape.
[18:02:01] <pompolic> you don't mutually update your mental models, just update someone else's
[18:02:04] <feep> yes.
[18:02:10] <pompolic> s/mental models/world-models/
[18:02:12] <feep> I think that's the core; affect is just because that's easier.
[18:02:12] <pompolic> that makes sense
[18:02:21] <pompolic> i think so yes
[18:02:40] <feep> okay, um
[18:02:45] <feep> circling back to mundus for a second
[18:02:50] <pompolic> no need to go through the semantic facilities if you have the firmware interface as it were
[18:02:53] <pompolic> sure
[18:02:55] <feep> rationality is constructed so that the convergent shape is also the true shape
[18:03:08] <feep> but like, for the interaction to work, that's not a *necessary* property
[18:03:25] <feep> this is why I brought up the association with antimemetics
[18:03:52] <pompolic> not sure i see the association with antimemetics, but: i think this had been the core of my anxiety about being manipulated
[18:04:06] <feep> like, if you look at the way that the inside of scp-whatshisface looks
[18:04:15] <pompolic> "if i let myself update on shit people say they might deliberately make me update away from the true state of things"
[18:04:18] <feep> these people are talking, they aumann update mutually or something to that effect
[18:04:31] <feep> but their interaction is about a warped subshape of reality
[18:04:44] <feep> something not just embedded, but that has embedded itself in the real structure.
[18:05:29] <feep> and again: the emotional effect of antimemetics works *even if we swap perspectives*; just the content becomes incomprehensible
[18:05:49] <pompolic> i think i lost you with the top 3 lines, but the last one has a familiar ring
[18:06:00] <feep> so back to northern caves, whatever state salby is in, I don't think he has the "link to reality" property of his convergence target.
[18:06:24] *** Joins: voltage_ (voltage@user/voltage)
[18:06:30] * pompolic nods sagely
[18:07:22] <feep> important note that the convergent target of aumann is not *true*.
[18:07:32] <pompolic> similarly: coming off from at least being a bit off in fantasyland while i was highly stressed involved redoubling on efforts to link my beliefs back to reality
[18:07:41] <pompolic> making them pay rent in anticipated experiences etc etc
[18:07:41] <feep> yeah that makes sense
[18:07:56] <feep> hug the data
[18:08:30] * feep tries to backtrack again..
[18:08:36] <pompolic> and i do think that people like Ziz stop doing that while extending their big theory
[18:08:38] <feep> [16:24] <pompolic> i had noticed that i had been massively confused about where my boundaries lie (both in the sense of "what i think is okay to do to me" and "what i think is me and not-me")
[18:08:50] <feep> I think this is the last pop-off point?
[18:08:57] <pompolic> think so
[18:09:06] <feep> pompolic: re ziz, well, I mean, pretty much nobody does it
[18:09:12] <feep> I will provisionally believe that gwern is close to reality.
[18:09:33] <feep> but way too few other people in the movement are gwern-shaped.
[18:09:38] <pompolic> yeah but normal people probably don't even try to make a theory of everything
[18:09:42] <pompolic> ...so yes
[18:10:09] <feep> well, normal people don't like-- okay, um, there's an aspect where, in a weird sense, human beings work really well when they're maybe a little conscious
[18:11:19] <pompolic> "The most merciful thing in the world, I think, is the inability of the human mind to correlate all its contents."
[18:11:25] <feep> right but also tho like
[18:11:29] <feep> we had kant on lesswrong recently
[18:11:47] <feep> and I said, I think, "well, looking at deep learning, we know that understanding concepts *does not require awareness*."
[18:12:04] <feep> you can get concepts as a pure effect of the medium.
[18:12:19] <feep> and then recently there was this research thing that found that brains basically do that distributed backtracking thing from a while back.
[18:12:23] <pompolic> this aligns with my experiences
[18:13:02] <pompolic> /me foos the bar and frobs the bizzlewoozle as an atomic action, then fails to explain what i just did with the code
[18:13:17] <feep> hee
[18:13:25] <feep> well, it should make sense eventually
[18:13:39] <feep> like, the same thing plays out at a higher level in the mind, right?
[18:13:53] <feep> if you routinely observe yourself, you will form concepts of yourself just as a matter of medium.
[18:14:02] <pompolic> yes
[18:14:08] <pompolic> i think i do this
[18:14:20] <feep> I think everyone who has ever used the word "I" in earnest has done this.
[18:14:27] <pompolic> ohhhh, yeah i think this ties back to boundaries
[18:14:52] <feep> other things this explains: parents
[18:14:56] <pompolic> figuring out that confusion wrt boundaries allowed me to translate tacit concepts of how my brain works into human words a little bit better
[18:15:12] <feep> if evolution already has a sense of self at hand, just biomechanically redirect it to point at the child
[18:15:50] <feep> thus explaining helicopter parents and vicarious experience of childhood
[18:16:28] <pompolic> "ah yes <thing> is just what the projection operation feels like"
[18:16:33] <feep> pompolic: old engineer joke: when you have a frog and you take it apart to understand how it works, the first thing you get is a dead frog
[18:16:44] <pompolic> funny you should mention helicopter parents
[18:17:01] <pompolic> because i was going to say that i think my confusion wrt boundaries arose from having a bit too many overbearing authority figures
[18:17:12] <feep> that makes perfect sense
[18:17:28] <feep> selfhood with puncture holes in
[18:17:35] <pompolic> more or less

[18:22:05] <feep> <inner salby> NO IT ISN'T!!
[18:23:32] <nshepperd2> not sure if this northern caves thing is meant to be an SCP or an elaborate way of saying "fuck you"
[18:23:52] <feep> it's definitely an scp
[18:24:12] <pompolic> maybe the real scp was in our lightcones all along
[18:24:29] <feep> it's guidance without content, convergence without truth

[18:25:08] <nshepperd2> the scp is coming from... inside the past light cone!
[18:25:26] <pompolic> oh, i think i'm starting to see
[18:25:45] <feep> and that's why I said it's from a perspective that excludes or shadows critical aspects
[18:25:51] <pompolic> an...attractor? for imperfectly-bayesian agents
[18:25:54] <feep> because there's supposed to be a *loop* there

[18:27:59] <feep> okay, take phoenix song. the thing that hermione has. intuitive, full and luminescent understanding of goodness.
[18:28:01] <feep> there's supposed to be a song there.
[18:28:41] <feep> but it's like someone constructed a committed, feverishly good human, and in the place where that blazing light is supposed to go there's this weird dirt.
[18:29:09] <feep> like, black dirt. at least that's what my synaesthesis says when I tell my brain to model salby
[18:29:11] <pompolic> i think i'm following
[18:29:44] <pompolic> i too understand things as geometric shapes
[18:29:48] <feep> and for some reason it keeps bringing up the concept of the dark sun from scott's post on why my immortal is an alchemical allegory?
[18:29:54] <feep> black sun*
[18:30:29] <feep> and I think it's a thing that's like how I imagine depression.
[18:31:03] <feep> but like... gray is the wrong analogy. past gray into -- there's a way to paint black and white but with contrast and force
[18:31:24] <feep> it's stark in its own sense, its sense just doesn't look like a color.
[18:31:45] <feep> but like-- the *rest* is all there! the mechanism is working
[18:32:06] <feep> there's just *something* blocked that involves like ... the material backreference to the human experience.
[18:32:42] <pompolic> i'm not sure i'm following
[18:32:47] <feep> pompolic: the one interesting thing is that ... for some reason, the nc entity has a preference for things to be orderedly separated?
[18:32:51] <feep> this is the one part I don't understand yet.

[20:52:18] <ggreer> for my GF's birthday yesterday we went to a bar. it was raining so everyone was inside. probably 50 people, standing room only. maybe I'll get covid, maybe I won't :shrug:
[20:53:47] <kuudes> I recommend third doses. but I am not a doctor, which may be why I am able to recommend them :-p
[20:54:18] <ggreer> looks like right now there are ~400 confirmed cases per 100k people in the county. that's 0.4%. assuming a random sampling of 80 people, that's a 70% chance that somebody in that room had covid
[20:54:52] <ggreer> the second dose fucked me up pretty bad. I'm split as to whether I want to get a 3rd dose or not

[20:56:34] <kuudes> personally I am tending toward a shot per quarter. but I think you are more healthy than I am
[20:56:40] <ggreer> 2nd dose was brutal for me. I was bedridden. I couldn't work for 2 days. my running times didn't get back up to pre-dose for a week.
[20:57:42] <kuudes> yeah. with third dose the next day I was feeling quite bad, so I mostly slept

[21:19:09] <kuudes> they would not need any new laws, it is up to executive decision
[21:19:14] <LeoTal> Where's "here"?
[21:19:16] <kuudes> finland
[21:19:21] <LeoTal> Thanks
[21:19:57] <kuudes> the scenario to which the law has been made to when it was made in 2016 (and before) is that if Unknown Terrorists would happen to spread smallpox in finland
[21:20:04] <mjr> Yep, got a law on the books for that, the government could unilaterally decide it (in conditions that are arguably quite satisfied), but it's politically hairy.
[21:20:10] <kuudes> so then we would order mandatory vaccination
[21:20:13] <kuudes> indeed
[21:20:30] <kuudes> but surprisingly there is no legal or constitutional or human rights ambiguity
[21:20:39] <kuudes> as in other regards there has been those quite a lot
[21:21:43] <kuudes> finland found out someone had "Forgot" some millions of doses of smallpox vaccines into a storage in 00s, when it was supposed to be destroyed after eradication of smallpox
[21:22:05] <kuudes> because only russia and usa are allowed to retain samples of smallpox, you know, to make vaccines if needed
[21:23:32] <kuudes> I presume they are now destroyd. maybe they could have been destroyed similarly as old weapons after the war, which were sunk into rivers wrapped in plastic which prevented them getting wet, or buried under buildings or or
[21:24:21] <kuudes> we have paranoid officials, so I presume someone could have stored those still somewhere. but that would be illegal so surely no one would do that
[21:26:27] <kuudes> PapuaHardyNet, like, https://yle.fi/uutiset/osasto/news/thl_recovered_patients_can_receive_second_dose_covid_pass/12156965 the officials have prevented people to get second dose if they have got covid in the past, even when we have doses for 20% of people laying around
[21:26:28] <Robomot> THL: Recovered patients can receive second dose, Covid pass | Yle Uutiset | yle.fi (Patients who have recovered from the virus and have been vaccinated once have not previously been entitled to a second dose.)
[21:26:51] <kuudes> for some reason the health officials opposed of allowing people to get second dose if they have contracted covid in the past
[21:28:59] <mjr> their decisionmaking is pretty much based on the principle of proven benefit, and they're not convinced there's health benefit from it (at least any time real soon)
[21:31:18] <kuudes> ye
[21:31:32] <kuudes> yes, and they seem to disqualify any attempt to stop infections
[21:32:15] <kuudes> I am a bit in a loss on why they dislike stopping infections so much
[21:33:51] <kuudes> mjr, do you have understanding why is it so? or do I misunderstand them?
[21:36:49] <mjr> health care mentality is pretty conservative in general, and there _are_ reasons for generally going that way instead of jumping on the latest fad that hasn't been conclusively proven yet
[21:37:06] <mjr> but then you lose a certain flexibility
[21:39:47] <kuudes> yes
[21:39:55] <kuudes> but why they take different opinion than EMA?
[21:40:17] <kuudes> and well, they indeed themselves also find third doses effective and safe, and still take opinion against them
[21:40:26] <kuudes> also indeed against second doses if you had got covid before

[22:19:03] <pompolic> but to make my case: if by persuasion is meant, a) using content-agnostic persuasion techniques, to b) lead someone to a predetermined conclusion, i do think that's dark arts
[22:19:08] <pompolic> PapuaHardyNet: appreciate the clarification

[23:22:45] <saturn2> if you want it in shell
[23:22:46] <kuudes> thanks mst
[23:22:58] <kuudes> would grep -a be useful in that btw?
[23:23:44] <mst> saturn2: won't that tend to read one word at a time (rather than line) if you don't set IFS
[23:24:04] <saturn2> no, read reads lines
[23:24:19] * mst wonders what he's misremembering
[23:24:31] <mst> ah well, the fact I'm not sure is basically why I reach for 'perl -le' and move on
[23:24:43] <saturn2> perl is fine too
[23:24:55] <[itchyjunk]> "In the second part of the diagram, AlphaFold 2 takes the multiple sequence alignment and the templates, and passes them through a transformer."
[23:24:58] <[itchyjunk]> Found the answer :s
[23:25:09] <saturn2> but it would be a bit silly to learn a whole new language just for this
[23:25:09] <kuudes> mst is correct https://linuxize.com/post/bash-read/
[23:25:10] <Robomot> Bash read Command | Linuxize (read is a bash built-in command that reads a line from the standard input (or from the file descriptor) and split into words. ‚Ä¶)
[23:25:31] <kuudes> read reads a line but puts the part before first space to first var etc
[23:26:04] <kuudes> "read -r var1 var2 <<< "Hello, World!"
[23:26:04] <mst> saturn2: I honestly regard one-liner perl as more 'advanced bash' than anything else
[23:26:04] <kuudes> printf "var1: %s \nvar2: %s\n" "$var1" "$var2""
[23:26:12] <kuudes> "Var1: Hello, 
[23:26:12] <kuudes> Var2: World!"
[23:26:34] <saturn2> kuudes: i don't think you have read the documentation carefully enough
[23:26:44] <kuudes> hmm. "When no argument is provided to the read command, the entire line is assigned to the REPLY variable:"
[23:26:50] <kuudes> "echo "Hello, world!" | (read; echo "$REPLY")"

[23:26:55] <kuudes> "Hello, World!"
[23:27:40] <kuudes> "The default behavior of read is to split the line into words using one or more spaces, tabs, and newline as delimiters."
[23:28:30] *** Joins: two2thehead (~user@27.114.177.23)
[23:28:33] <saturn2> the only problem is that it will collapse multiple spaces into one (if that is a problem)
[23:29:17] <saturn2> but for notify-send it's probably not a problem
[23:30:34] <kuudes> ah! "If there are more words than names, the remaining words and their intervening delimiters are assigned to the last name."

The gradual emergence of some of these analogies is clearly revealed when examining the samples generated by the model as it evolves during the transfer process. Figure 4 shows images obtained for the same latent

In the top row, we can see how human hair gradually evolves into dog ears, and the human nose and mouth gradually evolve into the dog‚Äôs nose and muzzle, while the pose remains mostly unchanged. A similarly smooth transition may be observed when transferring from AFHQ dogs to cats, as shown in the bottom row.'
