[06:58:53] <patchvonbraun[m]> Turns out the I219-LM 1G controller for lappys has very poor performance.  Even 10Msps uhd_fft gets "D" and "O" frequently, even though my CPU is more than keeping up--and i5-6300.   NO amount of futzing with MTU helps much.  One despairs...
[07:01:37] <mcdiarmid[m]> Hey patchvonbraun, I was able to fix frequent buffer overflowing on a demodulator I put together at work by experimenting with manual processor affinity allocation
[07:01:50] <mcdiarmid[m]> Same hardware and software, but the allocation helped a lot
[07:02:45] <patchvonbraun[m]> Can't do that with uhd_fft
[07:07:13] <mcdiarmid[m]> Aaaah darn, sorry about that.  Only other thing I could point towards is the stuff outlined on this page which you've probably seen https://files.ettus.com/manual/page_transport.html (assuming you're using a USRP)
[07:07:17] <patchvonbraun[m]> Poking around the intarweebz indicates that I219-LM is known to have performance issues.
[07:07:46] <patchvonbraun[m]> Yes.  I support USRPs part-time.  Quite familiar with that stuff :)
[07:09:41] <patchvonbraun[m]> My actual goal is to get my app working, but I thought I'd try uhd_fft, which is a fairly "lightweight" app.  It only calls the FFT at 10-20Hz, so most of the time it "does nothing".  Still dropping frames and overruning and generally carrying on like it's working up a sweat.
[07:12:05] <patchvonbraun[m]> And, to be maximally fair, the app ultimately won't be running on my lappy, but a multi-core server, probably XEON.  But since said server is sitting on a table at the CCERA site, in a trailer I can't get at right now...

[17:32:16] <BarryDuggan[m]> jemius: anything else?
[17:34:03] <jemius> BarryDuggan[m], I suspect not.. the issue I am having is that a pilot tone "disappears" when increasing frequency. It seems something is odd with my frequency scaling or my steps, I assume the signal just leaves the area covered by +/- f_N and then gets muffeled by some filter or similar effect
[17:34:51] <jemius> BarryDuggan[m], if I set frequency to 1MHz and have a sample rate of 500 kHz, then I should be able to receive from 750 kHz to 1250 kHz, aye?
[17:35:46] <BarryDuggan[m]> the sample rate is fixed at 192kHz
[17:37:11] <jemius> So what happens when I set f_S in GRC to 13049359943 – it's ignored and the SDR gives data as fast as possible, meaning 192kHz ?
[17:39:03] <BarryDuggan[m]> the FunCube is always 192kHz sample rate, fixed in the design.
[17:39:03] <BarryDuggan[m]> see if you can reproduce the FM receiver and work from there
[17:46:41] <jemius> aye aye

[22:51:06] <patchvonbraun[m]> Yamakaja: This is for a synthesis interferometer project in the summer.  Just doing some of the "can do it in the depths of winter in my office" work ahead of time.
[22:51:30] <Yamakaja[m]> Just wondering, how'd you implement it? Just by hand? I did something like that recently for some DoA work: https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/gr-ofdmradar/blob/master/lib/array_calib_impl.cc#L94-L95
[22:52:29] <patchvonbraun[m]> For radio astronomy you just need to do a complex-conjugate multiply for each baseline.   I did the baseline layout "by hand", but I could in the future write a block that takes N antenna inputs and produces all the possible baseline outputs.   But this works for now.
[22:52:37] <Yamakaja[m]> Wrong file, there: https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/gr-ofdmradar/blob/master/lib/array_corr_impl.cc#L105
[22:52:46] <Yamakaja[m]> s/https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/gr-ofdmradar/blob/master/lib/array_calib_impl.cc#L94-L95/<sinp>/
[22:52:55] <Yamakaja[m]> s/https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/gr-ofdmradar/blob/master/lib/array_calib_impl.cc#L94-L95/<removed>/
[22:53:32] <patchvonbraun[m]> You process the resulting fringe data later from all your baselines (sampled visibilities), and produce an image.
[22:53:58] <Yamakaja[m]> Oh, interesting
[22:54:13] <patchvonbraun[m]> For earth-rotation synthesis, you need several hours of good fringes (to get enough apparent rotation of the baseline wrt the source).
[22:55:32] <patchvonbraun[m]> The book I have on the subject is 500 pages, and "math heavy".  But for the "simple" case of a strict EAST-WEST baseline with multiple spacings, it's actually not that hard in practice...
[22:56:16] <patchvonbraun[m]> With an X310 with TwinRX, you can do 6 baselines at a time.  
[22:56:43] <patchvonbraun[m]> To get decent images (for certain values of "decent") you need 20-25 different baselines
[22:57:43] <patchvonbraun[m]> We'll assemble a "rail" that's about 30m long, and move the antennas along that rail at carefull-marked positions
[23:13:30] <Yamakaja[m]> patchvonbraun: How are you doing 6 baselines at once?
[23:14:03] <muaddib[m]> Yamakaja: where was the source for the graphic? Dani's twitter?
[23:14:36] <muaddib[m]> wanted to read the accompanying info
[23:14:47] <muaddib[m]> s/wanted/want/
[23:15:22] <patchvonbraun[m]> YamaYamakaja 4 antennas gives 6 baselines  N(N-1)/2  if the spacings are unique.

[23:24:03] <patchvonbraun[m]> The designer of those cards is Derek Kozel they're $pendy but excellent.   I'm lucky that as an Ettus part-time person I have some in my collection of stuff.
[23:25:12] <Yamakaja[m]> Neat :D
[23:36:55] <patchvonbraun[m]> It's too bad that X310 doesn't have any dual-1G images by default.  Because I have spare 1G cards, but no 10G infrastructure...
[23:37:27] <Yamakaja[m]> Time to invest in some 10G equipment, it's really become affordable ...
