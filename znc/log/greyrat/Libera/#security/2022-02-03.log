A storm of solar flares have never hit the planet as far as i can find so it's unlikely that even with large solar flares you would need "repeated" hits which is unlikely to happen in any event

[07:30:50] <yippeeka1> I picked the Debian package manager
[07:31:04] <yippeeka1> I shouldn't assume that everyone is running Deb distros. I stand corrected and I realized that.
[07:31:12] <yippeeka1> Duly noted. If he's running Arch that won't work
[07:31:23] <ghostbuster> you shouldn't paste google results as if you've verified that they work

[07:32:44] <ghostbuster> you could always just idle and learn, ie. what most people do
[07:32:57] <labrador> But yeah don't give perrierjouet bad advice he's french and is quite bad at english...so he might actually run what you gave him
[07:33:05] <yippeeka1> OK, shit!
[07:33:07] <yippeeka1> I won't do it again
[07:33:19] <yippeeka1> Ballbusters Inc. here
[07:34:20] <labrador> k
[07:34:27] <yippeeka1> And, actually he did learn because he saw a debate about it ... Probably learned more in the debate or the dissuasion than actually just copying and pasting a command. He learned why he should or should not do something. Though, if he did run some of that, perhaps the conversation would be much worse if the outcome weren't desired
[07:35:56] <yippeeka1> OK, so I'll jump in. Never run the rm -rf/ command
[07:36:11] <labrador> yippeeka1, hey man now you're getting a little annoying...why is it so hard to realize your advice was shit. Its like you're picking up a fight with me.
[07:36:26] <ghostbuster> there are 775 users here and 99% of them are not talking
[07:36:42] <labrador> yippeeka1, also its fine to run that command rm -rf / won't work until rm -rf /* or rm -rf / --no-preserver-root
[07:37:04] <labrador> The first is glob expansion,the second is making rm remove its protections
[07:37:16] <ghostbuster> some channels have a rule against posting destructive commands, even as a joke - but i guess that wouldn't work for #security
[07:38:02] <yippeeka1> So you think telling me "your advice was shit" is somehow adding a sense of calm in the storm. And saying so in front of the 775 users.
[07:38:26] <labrador> Yeah a stupid guy always ends up running it and then cries about it...thats why #linux has that rule ghostbuster
[07:38:43] <ghostbuster> nobody is having a storm except you, just have your storm quietly and then ask security questions
[07:40:07] <yippeeka1> I may understand the intent of this channel. Regardless of whether or not I agree with this, I may be misunderstanding what the houserules are or what people expect here.
[07:40:12] <yippeeka1> That much seems obvious
[07:40:22] <yippeeka1> So, is the main purpose of this for people to just ask questions and get guidance?
[07:40:48] <ajak> and discuss security and whatnot

[07:48:10] <yippeeka1> ... It's not straight-up pure WSL. It's in an isolated virtual env.
[07:48:33] <labrador> yippeeka1, I dunno what kind of interviews you're doing man but if you're securing servers...why would they ask you about powershell?
[07:48:36] <yippeeka1> *in my interviews

[08:14:38] <yippeeka1> Of course, if you're doing a whois on a Linux user or anyone heavy into tech, there's a high chance they're on a VPN so good luck on that.
[08:14:50] <labrador> yippeeka1, you don't need a vpn

[08:15:12] <yippeeka1> Here it goes ... But i want to hear your reasons
[08:15:26] <yippeeka1> OK, so you'll use Tor but not a VPN. I think both are cool
[08:15:30] <labrador> Tor protects...vpns do about nothing
[08:15:37] <yippeeka1> No, Snowden says to use Tor the same way
[08:15:41] <labrador> VPNs aren't useful for what you wanna do
[08:15:43] <yippeeka1> He says a VPN is your one-stop hop to failure
[08:15:44] <jessicara> tor partially protects
[08:15:52] <yippeeka1> I mean, he's probably right. I'm sure he's right
[08:15:56] <labrador> Snowden also says that 'VPNs are a single hop to failure'
[08:15:56] <yippeeka1> But for what I do, a VPN is fine

[08:16:21] <yippeeka1> If you're on a good VPN service, you can change your country in like 15 seconds

[08:16:33] <labrador> WHich is something I don't care about

[08:16:45] <jessicara> in some places it makes sense

[08:20:57] <EdFletcher> labrador: have _you_ read it all?

[08:21:09] <labrador> gnu/linux
[08:21:24] <yippeeka1> And, honestly, I think there are pros and cons to either Windows or Linux. I was being straight up when I said I only use Windows for 365

[08:21:36] <yippeeka1> I am about to order a Raspberry Pi
[08:21:49] <EdFletcher> there are pros and cons to all OSes, as they're just tools and each tool has problems for which it is best at solving.

[08:22:44] <yippeeka1> I'm on this and a Linux channel and everyone is getting me all fired up about Linux again. She bought me a Linux t-shirt for our anniversary
[08:22:49] <jessicara> i am questioning the continual buying of more hard drives
[08:22:49] <EdFletcher> if proprietary OSes had no benefit, then why do they persist and thrive labrador?
[08:23:03] <labrador> EdFletcher, because people do not gaf about freedom
[08:23:06] <labrador> They are lazy
[08:23:08] <labrador> thats why
[08:23:10] <yippeeka1> They thrive because they have monopolies and contracts with vendors
[08:23:11] <EdFletcher> wrong,  and rude
[08:23:21] <jessicara> it's as if there is only growth of data carry around
[08:23:21] <labrador> yippeeka1, that too

[08:23:39] <yippeeka1> I'll take fault for that

[08:24:01] <jessicara> 10 years ago i was happy with what 1tb?
[08:24:13] <jessicara> think i even had a 500gb drive somewhere?
[08:24:18] <labrador> Issues of freedom get my engines running yes...
[08:24:18] <yippeeka1> OK, so here's the deal: you all convince my wife that I need another primary desktop to run Linux and that we need to buy yet another box and I'll get right on that.
[08:24:31] <jessicara> now it's like shove 6tb drives everywhere because are the cheapest tb/currency
[08:24:34] <yippeeka1> And tell my interviewers that they're not looking at the full infrastructure - just the front facing machines
[08:24:42] <EdFletcher> labrador: what do you mean when you say "freedom" in this context? you keep using that word...
[08:24:46] <yippeeka1> That if the servers get a worm, the entire cloud statium could be fucked
[08:24:47] <ghostbuster> jessicara: what do you fill them with

[08:25:49] <EdFletcher> i think so too, but that's not "freedom". that's free as in beer, not free as in speech. and if it's the latter, then _i ask again labrador_: have you read and audited all this free code _for yourself_?

[08:30:37] <labrador> EdFletcher, sure sure...
[08:30:39] <EdFletcher> yippeeka1: you clearly need to read more about him before defending him
[08:30:57] <yippeeka1> Not defending him, dude. Just pointing out the logic.
[08:31:25] <yippeeka1> I like him personally. I have yet to read anything slamming him. But my points have nothing to do with my personal views on hi

[08:32:26] <labrador> EdFletcher, k
[08:32:37] <EdFletcher> LOL ok well then, he founded FSF so clearly is above reproach. case closed.
[08:32:44] <yippeeka1> These things are irrelevant to his views or developments in software.
[08:32:49] <yippeeka1> OK, so let's say he's a seriel killer
[08:32:53] <yippeeka1> Let's just say he is
[08:32:54] <labrador> No he's written a lot of code too
[08:32:59] <labrador> He's just not a talker
[08:33:04] <yippeeka1> He's not but let's say he is. What does that have to do with software?
[08:33:12] <labrador> nothing
[08:33:25] <EdFletcher> yippeeka1: a person's accomplishments do not excuse them from being a terrible human being. and frankly, his accomplishments are overblown anyway. the FSF isn't that great in the first place.

[08:37:29] <yippeeka1> Well, Ubuntu in my mind isn't exactly anti-corporate
[08:37:38] <labrador> I'd rather just buy cd's and play them

[08:38:32] <ajak> those aren't fsf approved though

[08:38:49] <labrador> ajak, sure...and I also don't align with everything the fsf say
[08:39:05] <yippeeka1> My opinions are evolving. I used to slam everyone who uses Windows but now I'm typ8ing on a Windows box
[08:39:08] <labrador> For instance I think the debian way is better of having a non free software repo
[08:39:23] <Affliction> I do find RYF amusing - FIRMWARE BLOBS BAD - unless they're hidden away from the main CPU - then they're fine
[08:39:24] <yippeeka1> After my coworkers gave me so much shit about it. But I was working with entry-level IT employees
[08:39:26] <labrador> Becuz not having one just makes less people use linux
[08:39:34] <yippeeka1> They weren't elite security analysts
[08:39:44] <labrador> And free OS with blobs >>>>> Proprietary OS
[08:39:46] <labrador> imho
[08:40:06] <Affliction> Instead of leaving the blobs where they're visible to all, so someone might at one point, RE and replace them with open firmware

[08:43:03] <yippeeka1> As far as the popularity with Linux in the general public. I thought and still think that Linux is for technical people but not non-technical. I say this referring to stuff that we've been discussing. Though Android is actually a Linux variant.
[08:43:31] <ajak> android is linux
[08:43:31] <yippeeka1> My point is that non-technical people aren't interested in Linux. I tried getting my wife onto it with Ubuntu and got immedate complaints
[08:43:50] <yippeeka1> She didn't understand the GUI. She didn't like the fact that the preferred update method is by way of the CLI
[08:44:04] <ajak> these are obviously solvable problems
[08:44:06] <yippeeka1> My understanding though is that Linux is more popular in Europe. I'm an American though
[08:44:08] <EdFletcher> The wonderful irony that the company that finally brought Linux to the desktop was… Microsoft
[08:44:11] <ajak> but they cannot be solved if linux people don't care
[08:44:16] <Affliction> There are graphical package managers, and you can try different WMs
[08:44:18] <dodo> no-technical people aren't interested in operating systems
[08:44:38] <Affliction> But yeah, linux still has signifcant UX problems for most "normal people"
[08:44:52] <yippeeka1> I guess is sort of irrelevant - talking to technical people about what non-technical people and what they want. Not preaching to the choir
[08:45:01] *** Parts: rock (~rock@user/rock) ()
[08:45:04] <labrador> ajak, I couldn't care less about people coming in without caring about freedom...it causes a lot of problems when they ask you why netflix isn't 1080p
[08:45:08] <Affliction> And, most of them don't want to mess around with trying different ways
[08:45:15] <EdFletcher> Exactly. Hence why proprietary OSes have benefit, the capital put into their development is to smooth out those UX corners
[08:45:17] <labrador> And then you're like 'wait you guys are running netflix?'
[08:45:18] <labrador> Why
[08:45:19] <Affliction> "I had a system that worked, and that I knew. Why change?"
[08:45:27] <yippeeka1> Interestingly, I here nothing on here about Apple products
[08:45:53] <EdFletcher> No one is paid enough to smooth out Linux on the desktop, and no one ever will be. Expect maybe the WSL team at MS.
[08:45:56] <yippeeka1> I agree with EdFletcher on the "exactly ..." comment
[08:46:15] <labrador> EdFletcher, wsl is not freedom
[08:46:19] <Affliction> EdFletcher: You know you're screwed when you're depending on Microsoft to fix Linux, heh
[08:46:21] <labrador> Doesn't matter what they do wth it

[08:50:08] <yippeeka1> Man, you don't like Snowden. Snowden is a fugitive
[08:50:17] <yippeeka1> He gave up his freedom to do what he did
[08:50:24] <yippeeka1> He'll never be able to come back to the U.S.

[23:50:56] <beanbag-> I dunno if I would say the whole country
[23:51:10] <beanbag-> but I think it's fair to be allowed to hack back anyone who tries to freak with you
