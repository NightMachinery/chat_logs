[00:02:41] <riv> am1985: I guess it's similar to the gaussian integral
[00:03:04] <riv> int[-inf,inf] e^(-x^2) dx = sqrt(pi)
[00:03:22] <riv> so if we just apply y = x+i substitution to your integral
[00:04:23] <am1985> Hmm, but then it's an integral over some set of complex numbers right?
[00:04:48] <am1985> Like from -Infinity+i to +Infinity+i
[00:05:06] <riv> yes
[00:05:12] <riv> hmm
[00:05:20] <riv> im not sure how to deal with that
[00:06:15] <riv> maybe -(x+i)^2 = -(x^2 + 2ix - 1) = -x^2 - 2ix + 1

[00:06:38] <riv> so exp(that) = exp(-x^2) exp(-2 i x) exp(1)
[00:12:15] <riv> ah
[00:12:37] <riv> maybe we can use the fact that there are no poles to equate the integral of across the real line with the real + i line
[00:14:59] <biberao> riv: poles or holes?
[00:15:23] <Ethos> Or the first quadrant. Uhm.
[00:15:24] <riv> every poles a hole

[00:27:59] <xaltsc> Without complex analysis, you can also use the fact that \int_-\infty^+infty e^{-(x+i)^2} dx = 2\int_R_+ Re(e^{-(x+i)^2}) = 2\int_R_+ e^{-x^2+1} dx
[00:31:49] <cherim> For R>0 you have the rectangle with corners -R, -R+i, R+i, R. Integral along all rectangle contour is 0 since holomorphic, along [-R, -R+i] it's abs. value bound yields <=e^{-R^2+1}*R, along [R+i, R] it's also <= e^{-R^2+1}*R, take the limit R->inf

[01:06:04] <somiaj> SineConfusesMe: correct, so if the frequency is 256 Hz, then the period is 1/256 seconds, and the wave number is k = 2pi * 256 = 512pi, so the function is sin(512pi t), which will correspond to 256 waves in a single second.

[01:30:54] <cherim> Then the integral is also infinite
[01:31:52] <cherim> If you even integrate e^{-x^2} for clarity, it's bounded away from 0 on this
[01:31:53] <xaltsc> No, y is fixed here, if you want to rewrite the integral, it's \int_R^2 f(x,y) 1_{y=1}(x,y) dxdy

[01:34:45] <xaltsc> Yes, if you change variable, with φ(z)=z-i, then abs(Jac(φ))=1 and φ send R+i to R, so \int_R^2 f(x,y)1_{y=1}(x,y) dxdy = \int_R^2 e^{-x^2} dxdy = \int R .... = \sqrt π

[01:36:15] <xaltsc> R^2 = C
[01:37:08] <greenbagels> SineConfusesMe: try not to get too confused on the dimensionless thing; the idea is that the trigonometric functions take angles (which are dimensionless) as arguments, and output ratios of lengths (hence also dimensionless)
[01:37:14] <xaltsc> And R is seen in C via R -> R[X]/(X^2+1) = C
[01:37:53] <cherim> You do not understand the meaning of what you write :(
[01:37:58] <greenbagels> so if you start to interpret things like the x in sin(kx) as seconds / meters / whatever, the k has to have the inverse dimensions of x (hertz / inverse meters / etc)

[06:53:53] <biberao> guys stupid question
[06:54:19] <biberao> imagine A={1,2,3,...,10} doesnt it mean it continues till 10?
[06:54:26] *** Joins: Guest22 (~textual@216.49.7.141.res-cmts.pnt2.ptd.net)
[06:54:37] <egzema> what continues?
[06:54:46] <biberao> the numbers
[06:54:49] <egzema> It's a set with 10 items
[06:54:54] <biberao> 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10
[06:55:04] <egzema> yes, that's the contents of the set
[06:55:13] <biberao> then
[06:55:34] <biberao> B={2,4,6,...,14}
[06:55:43] <biberao> do i have to assume this is an even set?
[06:56:23] <traxex> it most likely is {2,4,6,8,10,12,14}
[06:56:25] <egzema> even meaning its cardinality is an even integer?
[06:56:41] <biberao> traxex: well true
[06:56:48] <biberao> but we have to assume that?
[06:57:25] <traxex> if it's meant to be something else and context doesn't make that clear, blame the person who wrote it
[06:57:55] <biberao> ok
[06:57:59] <biberao> egzema: what do you mean
[07:01:00] <egzema> I mean |{2,4,6,8,10,12,14}| = 7 is an odd number.
[07:01:24] <biberao> ah
[07:01:31] <biberao> ah no
[07:01:40] <biberao> i meant the even
[07:01:45] <biberao> as even numbers set
[07:01:49] <egzema> the notion of an "even set" is not canonical.

[07:06:04] <biberao> gn and thanks!
[07:06:21] <egzema> you got it
[07:06:26] <traxex> one could write {2*1,2*2,2*3, ..., 2*7} to be very explicit, following advice from https://i.imgur.com/0sVRxPF.png

[16:21:54] <Gurkenglas> Let's say that we have two relations R and L, and RLR=R and LRL=L, to bring this closer to adjunctions
[16:22:20] <int-e> My brain is seeking a link to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galois_connection
[16:22:23] *** Joins: smile (uid510004@user/smi)
[16:22:29] <Gurkenglas> yes galois connections are adjunctions
[16:22:30] <int-e> (but without success)
[16:22:59] <int-e> Anyway, there's some similarities to that. But nothing that suggests a name for this to me.
[16:23:31] <Gurkenglas> that similarity made me go for this property :)
[16:24:06] <int-e> But maybe it is worth noting that R subset R R^-1 R for free.
[16:25:14] <Gurkenglas> yes that sounds like it'll help direct this musing
[16:25:47] <Gurkenglas> the obvious next step is to look at what nlab has to say about generalizing adjunctions *dives*
[16:27:28] <Gurkenglas> nlab wants a notion of 2-morphism between two relations R,R' between A and B. The obvious notion is R subset R'.
[16:27:49] <int-e> Hmm, another idea is that this may have a name in graph theory (viewing the relation as a bipartite graph)
[16:29:42] <Gurkenglas> Then a 2-adjunction in this 2-category is a pair C,D with relations L:C->D,R:D->C and Id subset R-after-L and L-after-R subset Id

So this is *still* functions, except that both L and R are allowed to mention the same (c,d) pair multiple times.

[23:32:33] <Z-module> [-_-]: Cauchy's Integral Theorem is just for the case of the function being analytic on a whole open set that contains the closed contour and all of the region inside it -- no singularities.

[23:40:20] <riv> i was being sarcastic ;;
[23:40:32] <riv> i dont know how to map a torus onto a sphere
[23:40:55] <isekaijin> riv: Use a meromorphic function.
[23:41:01] *** Quits: [-_-] (~fractal@user/---/x-1675478) (Quit: ZZZzzz?)
[23:41:08] <isekaijin> A meromorphic function is literally a map to the Riemann sphere.
[23:41:10] <riv> the weierstrass p?
[23:41:13] <isekaijin> Yeah.
[23:41:33] <riv> ok and the 4 points are the cell
[23:41:39] <isekaijin> Yeah.

[23:42:01] <riv> > And now it's time to come clean: a map the torus to the sphere that's 2-1 and angle-preserving except at 4 points where it's 1-1 is usually called an 𝗲𝗹𝗹𝗶𝗽𝘁𝗶𝗰 𝗳𝘂𝗻𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 on an 𝗲𝗹𝗹𝗶𝗽𝘁𝗶𝗰 𝗰𝘂𝗿𝘃𝗲.   I've just shown you the two most symmetrical ones!
[23:42:13] <riv> hm
[23:42:15] <riv> ok
[23:42:33] <riv> actually its a nice insight to see the weierstrass p function as a twofold map from the torus to the sphere
[23:42:38] <riv> with 4 exceptional points
[23:42:40] <Z-module> Hmm, that reminds me, there is no continuous injection S^1 x S^1 -> S^2 , is there?

[23:49:28] <johnkeats7> Z-module, i think invariance of dimension settles it?
[23:49:38] <johnkeats7> has to be open map
[23:51:54] <Z-module> Yes, then what?
[23:51:54] <isekaijin> Mmm... Are orientable surfaces in some sense “simple enough” that we can understand all continuous maps between them by looking at them as Riemann surfaces and just looking at holomorphic maps?
[23:52:27] <Z-module> (clearly it's not surjective, since those spaces are compact hausdorff and not homeomorphic)
[23:52:34] <johnkeats7> Z-module, well then compactness makes the image closed also, and then connectedness?
[23:53:08] <Z-module> oh right, there you go

[23:54:14] <johnkeats7> don't you know how awful continuous maps are
[23:55:23] <isekaijin> Yeah.
[23:57:40] <johnkeats7> there's a classification of non-compact surfaces and it's hard
[23:57:43] <isekaijin> But what if we only care, e.g., about homotopy classes of maps?
[23:57:48] <isekaijin> Oh, I meant compact surfaces, sorry.
[23:57:54] <isekaijin> Compact orientable surfaces.
[23:58:33] <johnkeats7> well you're getting into that mapping class group stuff territory
[23:58:40] <johnkeats7> i never learned about it
[23:58:48] <johnkeats7> but it's a Big Thing
