[03:38:02] <LjL> eqw, it's not the plural form per se, it just happens to coincide with the plural form nowadays, it used to be just a different mood/tense in older english

[12:48:22] <kurahaupo> superduperdancin: There are people here
[12:50:18] <Voxel> Of course!
[12:50:20] <Voxel> Hey there ^^
[12:50:28] <superduperdancin> Hi :)
[12:51:43] <kurahaupo> "stamping" implies very99,99 heavy footfall. I don't think there are any movements in that video that qualify as that
[12:52:09] <darsie> stomping?
[12:52:13] <kurahaupo> Did you perhaps just mean foot-tapping?
[12:52:23] <darsie> .w stamp
[12:52:25] <tinsoldier> stamp — Noun: 1. An act of stamping the foot, paw or hoof., 2. An indentation, imprint, or mark made by stamping., 3. A device for stamping designs., 4. A small piece of paper bearing a design on one side and adhesive on the other, used to decorate letters or craft work., — Verb: 1. (intransitive) To step quickly and heavily, once or repeatedly., 2.  <https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/stamp>...
[12:53:05] <kurahaupo> superduperdancin: Or do you mean the leg movements why the feet stay on the floor?
[12:53:13] <kurahaupo> *while
[12:55:14] <superduperdancin> yes!
[12:55:27] <superduperdancin> the leg movements why the feet stay on the floor
[12:55:37] <superduperdancin> the leg movements where the feet stay on the floor
[12:55:56] <darsie> Moon dance ;)
[12:58:47] <kurahaupo> She taps her left heel on the floor while keeping her weight on her right foot and her left toes stationary on the floor. Moon dancing usually involves sliding the toes; I think I'd just call it "heel tapping" (be analogy with "toe tapping")
[12:59:25] <kurahaupo> *by analogy
[13:00:16] <superduperdancin> yes now we're getting close!
[13:00:54] <kurahaupo> I don't think I would bother being more specific than "improvised dancing"
[13:01:29] <kurahaupo> the exact leg movements don't seem particularly planned

[13:03:22] <superduperdancin> kurahaupo no i know,

[13:05:31] <superduperdancin> so, heel tapping sounds like the most exact term, but we need the leg shake motion as well., which is mostly the important part of the definition

[18:51:12] <cousteau> You mean this particular case?  Nothing 
[18:52:15] <cousteau> I meant that Wiktionary said it was a British expression, but I've seen it used here in Ireland, so it might be a British/Irish idiom (and probably other English-speaking countries) 
[18:52:22] <StayHungry> cousteau: I'm referring to your years of experience in that part of the world
[18:52:57] <cousteau> Oh.  Well, can't say much because I haven't met many Brits to compare 
[18:54:10] <pussipupu> We're terrible, if that helps

[19:38:18] <cousteau> GuiToris: might be interesting if you could make that thing start only when the phone reaches 100% of charge 
[19:38:39] <huf> ah yes, we must somehow preserve an energy wasting feature in these times
[19:39:40] <GuiToris> cousteau, so it could fully discharge it by the time I need it! :D
[19:40:13] <cousteau> No because if it's plugged it'll continue charging while wasting that extra energy 
[19:40:41] <GuiToris> I know, but that animation is not worth all this pain
[19:40:57] <huf> what's wrong with just a small red led?

[19:43:07] <cousteau> Actually no.  I used to, but I no longer do 
[19:43:17] <huf> they became basically useless once monitors could turn themselves off on idle
[19:43:22] <cousteau> And I have some nice ones available 
[19:43:58] <cousteau> huf: true.  They're now just an indicator that the PC is on.  But there's an LED for that. 
[19:44:07] <huf> not if you tape over it :D
[19:44:19] <huf> I've had problems diagnosing the state of the computer/monitor because of this :D
[19:44:58] <cousteau> (by the way, is it "an LED" (pronounced as L. E. D.) or "a LED" (pronounced as "led")?) 
[19:45:14] <huf> also you dont really need an indicator for that now, the computer is always on anyway :D
[19:45:29] <huf> cousteau: *I* pronounce it like the word "led" but I think they usually spell it out
[19:45:58] <GuiToris> I imagine huf has a nice, white, shiny iPhone with an ugly black duct tape over the leds
[19:46:04] <pussipupu> “an ell ee dee”
[19:46:08] <bin> I disagree... I find the blue LED useful for knowing when a device is on
[19:46:16] <huf> at least make it green
[19:46:19] <huf> that's less terrible
[19:46:23] <cousteau> In Spanish it's "led" but that might be because "led" isn't already a word in Spanish

[19:47:11] <huf> cousteau: eh, they already have "lead", they can stand another
[19:47:14] <cousteau> Yeah, green is more pleasant.  Blue is too bright and red looks like it's signaling danger.

[19:47:28] <huf> yes
[19:47:33] <huf> or just an old device :)
[19:47:46] <cousteau> But, colorblind people may prefer blue/red over green/red. 
[19:48:01] <bin> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[19:48:02] <huf> well then just make it less bright
[19:48:08] <pussipupu> RGB LEDs are cheap, make it user-configurable
[19:48:09] <bin> huf: that i definitely agree with

[19:49:02] <bin> i have a bookshelf stereo in my bedroom and the blue light is SO FRIGGIN BRIGHT but also it tells me i need to hit the pwr button lol
[19:49:08] <huf> :)
[19:49:29] <cousteau> bin: that's not how LEDs work though; I think they're designed to work at a fixed power, and if you want to dim it you need to switch it on and off rapidly 
[19:49:35] <twb> bin: blue LEDs became cheap around 2009, so people put them in everything
[19:49:41] <pussipupu> My phone's power button on the side glows bright white when charging
[19:49:48] <twb> so like "red = off; green = on" became "blue = off; blue = on"
[19:49:49] <cousteau> Or buy an LED with a lower power rating. 
[19:50:04] <twb> And a side effect was that blue LEDs were brighter at the same voltage, so you also had SUPER BRIGHT mofos
[19:50:30] <twb> I recommend you tape over them with black electrician's tape, or dim them by painting over them with a black sharpie
[19:50:57] <GuiToris> you have forgotten to mention the hammer technique
[19:51:56] <pussipupu> Tape over your hammer
[19:52:15] <huf> odd
[19:52:26] <twb> when using LEDs for illumination instead of status reporting, then yeah, dimming requires extra electronics.
[19:53:04] <twb> signalling LEDs are usually a single LED per signal and don't do dimming at all
[19:53:44] <cousteau> Well, you CAN make them do dimming 
[19:53:56] <huf> the manufacturer could tape over it

[19:54:54] <cousteau> I had a USB stick with an indicator LED that would dim on and off.  It did so using a PWM.  My PC's front connector board was so poorly designed that I could actually hear the PWM on my headphones. 
[19:55:19] <huf> I've heard a kindle turn the page 
[19:55:21] <cousteau> (PWM = "switching things on and off very fast")

[23:00:03] <StayHungry> sorry if I have been overly assertive on this topic, not being a native speaker. apparently, I was provoked by our comrade's persistent denial of all sorts of evidence from plaques to the prominent style guide :)

[23:23:43] <StayHungry> blkshp: we're talking about the placement of the AD abbreviation

[23:47:01] <cousteau> I've always heard it as "two thousand AD", ergo 2000AD
[23:47:20] <cousteau> Then again, "two thousand dollars" is "$2000"
[23:47:31] <blkshp> Not in a lot of europe
[23:47:53] *** Joins: Haxxa (~Haxxa@116-255-6-75.ip4.superloop.com)
[23:47:58] <cousteau> All English speaking countries in Europe write it like that 
[23:48:05] <cousteau> Or at least half of them 
[23:48:14] <blkshp> StayHungry: been there.
[23:49:12] <cousteau> I've always assumed it has a lot to do with the language.  Like how English speaking countries typically write 1,000.00 and others write 1.000,00
[23:50:12] <blkshp> Possibly.
[23:50:18] <cousteau> So... AD means "year of the Lord", so you would say "In the year of the Lord of 2021...", or "In AD 2021..."
[23:51:09] <cousteau> I mean, "AD 2021" would make sense.  But I've always seen it written as "2021 AD" 
[23:51:18] <StayHungry> cousteau: looks like you missed everything that was said before :)
[23:51:25] <blkshp> As did I :D
[23:51:36] <cousteau> Oh 
[23:54:53] <cousteau> Anyway, in Spanish we just say "before Christ" (AC) or "after Christ" (DC) so it comes naturally to put it after the number.  And none of this obscure "year of the Lord" nonsense, like what does that even mean?  (Wouldn't all years belong to the Lord anyway?) 
[23:58:04] <StayHungry> cousteau: yes, for secular use there are BCE (before common era) and CE (common era) in English
[23:59:19] <cousteau> I spent a great deal of  my life convinced that it was just BC (before Christ) and AC (after Christ) 
[23:59:50] <cousteau> Never heard of CE though.  I learned something!
