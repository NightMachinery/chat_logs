[04:45:54] <earendel> when you try to access a property of an object, it will be looked upon way down its "prototype chain" until it hits a result or return undefined. the prototype chain itself are just ojects as well. one clue is you can have methods all defined on some prototype while the differentieting values, can be stored in the object itself. allowing to have classes of objects with consistent methods and properties effectively.

[06:39:24] <entuland> gggp, maybe you posted in the wrong channel?
[06:41:16] <sickdyd> how can I use props in a styled component without tempalte literals? `const Something = styled('div')({ something: '1rem' })`
[06:42:02] *** Joins: comatory_ (~ondrejsyn@93.99.127.7)
[06:42:13] <entuland> sickdyd, depends on what styled() does
[06:42:27] <entuland> is that a function you have or is it just a dummy function you made up on the spot?
[06:42:41] <entuland> not sure what you mean with "template literals" either
[06:43:46] <entuland> if you want to add such a declaration and affect all the DIVs, you need to add it to the stylesheet and not attach it as inline style to any element of the DOM
[06:44:04] <entuland> better yet if you do that directly in the CSS file
[06:44:16] <entuland> and only add a class to specific instances you want affected by that rule

[06:44:57] <runicskull> sickdyd, why no templates?
[06:45:24] <earendel> i think styled is a lib to create styled elements with stylesheet tuples. no clue how template literals help with anything, and if they do why would you not use them
[06:45:57] *** Joins: bambanxx (~bambanx@181-163-41-115.baf.movistar.cl)
[06:45:57] <sickdyd> entuland: it's from the `styled-components` library, you can use template literals like styled.div` property: 1rem; ` or styled('div')({ property: 1rem; })
[06:46:16] <sickdyd> both do the same thing, but I know how to access props in the first case, can't figure it out for the second case

[06:46:35] <entuland> ah crap the backtick thingies are called template strings, I forgot about that
[06:46:36] <sickdyd> runicskull: because it's a 100 lines component that would need reformatting :>
[06:46:51] <entuland> can't tell, sickdyd, you should probably check the docs of the styled library
[06:46:54] <runicskull> I mean, a string's a string. You should be able to just use + to concatenate things in.
[06:47:31] <earendel> it's object literals.. and you could have classes like objects and apply them to the style property without any lib.
[06:47:32] <sickdyd> entuland: the docs talk more about `` rather than ('')
[06:48:18] <entuland> is that something that get parsed in some special way? "styled.div` property: 1rem; `" doesn't look like valid JS syntax (the stuff inside the double quotes)
[06:48:40] <earendel> missing quotes.
[06:49:34] <GreenJello> tagged template literals don't always produce a string, and don't have to interpolate like normal template literals
[06:49:59] <earendel> the good part is all styles are just converted to camel case (from snail case? iirc) when accessed through DOM
[06:50:11] <GreenJello> and there are few rules about what you can put inside them, with only ` and \ and ${ being special
[06:50:51] <sickdyd> GreenJello: do you know how I can use props in a tagged template literal?
[06:51:09] *** Joins: comatory_ (~ondrejsyn@93.99.127.7)
[06:51:17] <GreenJello> with styled-components it's like div`x: ${props => props.x}`
[06:51:47] <earendel> u wouldn't have to use quotes in css. but it would be cool if there would be a property-unit property. so one could calculate with the numbers.
[06:51:58] <earendel> maybe you could add such.
[06:52:03] <runicskull> I mean, the benefit of styled components is that a lot of the frameworks that it slides into will programatically scope it to a given component. So your styled.div turns into <div class="ab8Ce9"><div> and all your rules apply to that unique class and the things inside it.
[06:52:22] <sickdyd> I could make that one work, then I meant how to use props in const Element = styled('div')({ props? })
[06:52:34] <earendel> oh. so it generates a stylesheet.
[06:52:51] <runicskull> Yep.
[06:53:32] <runicskull> sickdyd: Like this? https://styled-components.com/docs/basics#styling-any-component
[06:54:05] <earendel> yeah. quite a silly approach. if you ask me it's hacky. i would use apply on the style property with class like collections of stylesheetprops.
[06:54:19] <sickdyd> runicskull: the props example is with backticks :>

[06:55:39] <sickdyd> lol, thanks anyway
[06:55:59] <runicskull> I think styled-components has a solid niche in React work. I wouldn't use it outside of that or an adjacent framework.
[06:56:27] <earendel> there are better ways to dynamically generate stylesheets. however applying plain object styles has it merits.

[07:08:10] <gggp> dom is xml stream
[07:08:40] <runicskull> I mean, no, DOM isn't specific to JS. It's used in scripting languages for plenty of different object-modelable documents (XML, CSV, etc). JS is preferred because it's now packaged in browsers and HTML is the default template language also included in the browser.

[13:34:07] <pycode> hello everybody, i have built an application with django an now i need to create the frontend, it is basically a server side rendered website, but i have a page where i need to show a kind of report, this report has a chart, the problem here is that a financial chart (candlestick) and it has a looot of candles (around 200/300k) so the point is that i cannot load the entire chart with ALL the points, i need to create a kind of
[13:34:07] <pycode> cursor that leave the user to scroll (horizontally) and maybe loading new points when it reachs the boundaries
[13:34:14] <pycode> how to deal with that?
[13:34:23] <pycode> a kind of lazy loading points,
[13:35:02] <pycode> the problem is this...i can load a month of history, then when the user scroll, i should load more points BEFORE it reach the bondaries otherwise it will see a "blocked charts" without candles, so i should load them before
[13:35:15] <pycode> does anyone deal with big charts?
