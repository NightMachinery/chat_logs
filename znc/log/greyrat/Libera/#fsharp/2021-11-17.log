[18:02:22] <MatthiasVance> indomitable: I believe I shared? :D Went very good, then day after I got told to either have my last working day the day after, or spend the rest of the month "being unhappy" (not literal words, but you get the point)
[18:04:39] <biberu> MatthiasVance: wtf, i'm sorry that it didn't work out as you hoped, but it sounds better to get out of that place early...
[18:08:59] <MatthiasVance> Morning of that day was onboarding a new tech partner so ... yeah that was a great "ending" of my day
[18:10:09] <MatthiasVance> Few days later when having fun at new company get together got an e-mail about how I supposedly expressed myself in a surprising manner (nothing concrete in there), reset my laptop to factory defaults and didn't work a full day so they felt they needed to "revisit our financial agreement"
[18:10:45] <MatthiasVance> I thought I was done last tuesday but still end up spending energy on them =/
[18:11:07] <MatthiasVance> Also money wise, they don't stand to gain anything, so it's yet another personal attack, or at least definitely feels that way. :)
[18:12:11] *** Quits: rond_ (~rond_@2a02:a31a:a23c:f480:2fd7:e087:5546:a438) (Quit: Client closed)
[18:12:17] <biberu> maybe the guy is just on some power trip
[18:15:51] <MatthiasVance> That is what I think yeah
[18:16:46] <MatthiasVance> Problem with signed agreements is they only work if you have a way to enforce them :) So now I have to get other people involved in this shit
[18:17:27] <biberu> ouch
[18:17:40] <biberu> are they going after you for something, or the other way around?
[18:19:00] <MatthiasVance> Well if they want to "revisit our financial agreement" and actually proceed with not adhering to our terms (that both parties signed) I will have to get lawyers involved :(
[18:19:47] <biberu> who knows what he meant by that though
[18:21:35] <MatthiasVance> Pretty sure they are only referring to the early exit, because it had a financial component (I don't have to pay back 2.5 vacation days ðŸ˜‚)
[18:23:27] <biberu> jeez, how can it even be worth everyone's time for that kind of money
[18:31:07] <MatthiasVance> My thoughts exactly..
[18:33:00] <biberu> i hope it sorts itself out without too much drama for you
[18:37:05] <biberu> MatthiasVance: inspiration for when the wind blows: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Oak_and_the_Reed
[18:49:18] <MatthiasVance> biberu: Thank you! 
[18:57:33] <MatthiasVance> biberu: Also, when I make that code change we were talking about yesterday, it works in the new compiler but no longer in the old one ðŸ¤¦
[18:59:36] <biberu> fail forward /o/
[18:59:49] <MatthiasVance> And now I am unsure how to proceed lol
[19:00:11] <MatthiasVance> You said it also failed in VS 2019 right?
[19:00:21] <biberu> wait, i'll open it in 2019 again
[19:01:15] <biberu> 2019 builds with licensePlate = Some x.NumberPlate
[19:01:39] <MatthiasVance> Yeah but it's producing the same output as VS 2022 then?
[19:01:48] <MatthiasVance> So also using the latest F# compiler probably?
[19:01:59] <MatthiasVance> Since you have the newer one installed and you can't pick and choose :D
[19:02:03] <biberu> possibly, .net 6 is installed on this system
[19:02:21] <biberu> i think i have another computer with only 2019 around here
[19:02:29] <biberu> i can try it on that one later tonight
[19:02:47] <MatthiasVance> But that means I can't have .NET 6 period
[19:02:59] <MatthiasVance> That's not an option :(
[19:03:17] <biberu> i don't think this one does
[19:03:19] <MatthiasVance> biberu: No need to try that one out, thank you so much though
[19:03:26] <MatthiasVance> biberu: My point exactly
[19:03:35] <MatthiasVance> If it works on your plain VS 2019 machine it won't help :P
[19:03:43] <biberu> oh
[19:03:50] * biberu useless
[19:03:59] <MatthiasVance> I'm looking for the best possible workaround now =/
[19:04:06] <biberu> c#?
[19:04:07] * biberu runs
[19:04:19] <MatthiasVance> Well there was this one person on SO adding those targets, right
[19:04:52] <MatthiasVance> If I do that in a good way so that you can pin the F# version of a project using <FSharpLangVersion> or whatever, that gets then used in such a target, that might work
[19:05:03] <MatthiasVance> But I think at that point I might as well switch to Rider?
[19:05:24] *** Joins: stenno (~stenno@user/stenno)
[19:05:59] <biberu> got to run for a bit :)
[19:06:06] <biberu> for real this time
[19:06:36] <MatthiasVance> Enjoy your run if it's an actual run
[19:06:36] <MatthiasVance> :D
[19:06:40] <MatthiasVance> ðŸ‘‹
[19:07:01] <indomitable> MatthiasVance, always get ANY "special deal" in writing
[19:07:06] <MatthiasVance> I have
[19:07:07] <indomitable> never just agree to things orally
[19:07:11] <MatthiasVance> I never do
[19:07:13] <indomitable> so if tuesday was your last working day
[19:07:15] <indomitable> that should've been in writing
[19:07:19] <MatthiasVance> It is in writing
[19:07:22] <indomitable> good
[19:07:27] <MatthiasVance> :D
[19:07:28] <indomitable> then no "financial action" will be taken
[19:07:45] <indomitable> "make like an acrobat and go fuck yourself" would be my reply to him then
[19:07:50] <MatthiasVance> They can still choose to not comply with said agreement
[19:07:56] <indomitable> how
[19:08:00] <MatthiasVance> By not following it
[19:08:05] <indomitable> they can't
[19:08:06] <MatthiasVance> By just giving me less money than agreed
[19:08:07] <indomitable> they put it in writing
[19:08:11] <indomitable> no they can't
[19:08:19] <MatthiasVance> They literally can
[19:08:19] <indomitable> you live in the netherlands right? not some third world nation
[19:08:20] <akronymus[m]> then the lawyers would practically drool
[19:08:26] <indomitable> yes, this is a VERY bad idea from them
[19:08:31] <MatthiasVance> YES that is true
[19:08:38] <indomitable> call a lawyer
[19:08:39] <indomitable> do it fast
[19:08:42] <MatthiasVance> Already done
[19:08:42] <indomitable> have them send a letter to them right away
[19:08:44] <indomitable> ncie
[19:08:44] <indomitable> !
[19:08:51] <indomitable> \o/
[19:08:57] <indomitable> maybe for xmas you get the tears of your former boss
[19:08:57] <MatthiasVance> My point was more, this puts the pressure on me to respond, which is shitty
[19:09:06] <akronymus[m]> I think you are likely to get it pro bono as well.
[19:09:14] <akronymus[m]> if it is as clear as you represent it
[19:09:14] <MatthiasVance> akronymus[m]: I used my legal insurance for this
[19:09:23] <akronymus[m]> Good
[19:09:26] <MatthiasVance> akronymus[m]: What I quoted was a direct translation
[19:09:44] <akronymus[m]> they're screwed then
[19:10:04] <MatthiasVance> You could argue that I should have worked the agreed upon hours that week / day?
[19:10:26] <MatthiasVance> But who works a full day on their last day in a non-factory setting, you do whatever you can and leave, right? :D
[19:12:24] <akronymus[m]> I dont like accusing people of lying/misrepresentation.
[19:12:50] <akronymus[m]> Just... a current trial is REALLY making me on edge about it.
[19:14:43] <MatthiasVance> shit akronymus[m] :(
[19:18:39] <indomitable> you have a trial akronymus[m] ?
[19:18:39] <indomitable> D:
[19:18:41] <indomitable> what did you do
[19:18:45] <indomitable> did you murder someone for not being monadic
[19:20:21] <akronymus[m]> No, i follow a quite high profile one
[19:20:47] <indomitable> is it the people vs jesus?
[19:21:54] <akronymus[m]> rittenhouse
[19:22:02] <indomitable> didn't he already walk
[19:22:18] <indomitable> didn't you know, putting yourself in dangerous situations while armed to the teeth is not vigilantism, it's freedom now
[19:22:28] <akronymus[m]> No, jury is still talking
[19:22:33] <indomitable> he'll walk
[19:22:34] <akronymus[m]> And thats not what he did
[19:22:42] <akronymus[m]> He will walk though
[19:22:46] <indomitable> what did he do
[19:22:48] <indomitable> if that's not what he did
[19:23:03] <indomitable> he 100% did that, the jury would convict him for vigilantism
[19:23:06] <indomitable> but they didn't charge him with that
[19:23:08] <akronymus[m]> go help his community, while carrying a gun as a deterance
[19:23:08] <indomitable> they charged him with murder
[19:23:15] <indomitable> mmm no
[19:23:18] <indomitable> he's a vigilante
[19:23:35] <indomitable> you don't help your community carrying a loaded AR-15 in a violent crowd
[19:23:35] <akronymus[m]> Clearly you arent folloqinf the actual trial
[19:23:39] <indomitable> that's the job for the *police*
[19:23:56] <indomitable> if your country has people armed to the teeth going to protests, well, you live in a third world country
[19:23:58] <indomitable> and there are no poilce
[19:24:27] <indomitable> I consider it insane that he will walk even on murder, but he will
[19:24:28] <akronymus[m]> Was he dumb to go there? Yeah
[19:24:31] <indomitable> 100% murderer and a sociopath
[19:24:40] <akronymus[m]> was it vigilantism or murder? no
[19:24:47] <indomitable> yes, it 100% was
[19:24:56] <akronymus[m]> Does it have bearing on his guilt? no
[19:25:04] <akronymus[m]> It was a VERY clear cut self defence
[19:25:10] <indomitable> no it wasn't
[19:25:18] <indomitable> self defence doesn't involve putting yourself in a dangerous position on purpose
[19:25:23] <akronymus[m]> Well, are you following the trial?
[19:25:31] <indomitable> yes
[19:25:39] <akronymus[m]> He didnt put himself into danger on purpose
[19:25:44] <indomitable> he 100% did
[19:25:47] <indomitable> he went to a protest fully armed
[19:25:49] <akronymus[m]> Acrual court proceedings?
[19:26:02] <akronymus[m]> Or news/reddit?
[19:26:26] <indomitable> I know the facts are: he didn't live in that state. He went to that state. He acquired a firearm illegally from his friends. He went to a protest armed with said firearm.
[19:26:34] <indomitable> That chain of events ALONE means "self defence" is out of the question
[19:26:50] <akronymus[m]> He lived closer to kenosha than the people that died
[19:27:04] <akronymus[m]> the gun wasnt illwgal under wisconsin law
[19:27:08] <indomitable> Good for him - he still crossed state lines to do it.
[19:27:17] <indomitable> If he went there without a gun, sure, that would've been self defence if he killed someone.
[19:27:25] <akronymus[m]> He was there the night before the riots
[19:27:26] <indomitable> He took a lethal firearm, fully loaded from what I understand, and he killed someone there.
[19:27:33] <indomitable> Whether he feared for his life is not important
[19:27:36] <indomitable> He wasn't supposed to be armed to begin with
[19:27:56] <akronymus[m]> It actually is central whether he feared for his life
[19:28:03] <indomitable> Of course he feared for his fucking life
[19:28:06] <indomitable> That isn't important at all
[19:28:11] <indomitable> IF you take a GUN into a PLACE OF CONFLICT
[19:28:14] <indomitable> you are an INSTIGATOR.
[19:28:17] <indomitable> I dont' care which side of it you're on
[19:28:25] <akronymus[m]> Well, then you are ignorant of the fucking law
[19:28:35] <akronymus[m]> And with that i will disengage
[19:28:43] <indomitable> At least I'm not ignorant of basic logic
[19:28:44] <indomitable> :p
[19:28:49] <indomitable> Laws can be wrong, logic seldom is
[19:29:05] <indomitable> I'm sure he'll walk. But he's a murderer, and probably a white power nationalist.
[19:29:26] <indomitable> You'd think someone in Germany/Austria would oppose that kind of thing, but I guess history is repeating itself
[19:29:40] <stenno> er what?
[19:29:45] <stenno> which history ?
[19:30:13] <indomitable> stenno, resurgence of fascism. It's happening everywhere though.
[19:30:20] <stenno> oh yeah afd
[19:30:35] <indomitable> But in the old days I would have expected Germans/Austrians to be particularly sensitive to such changes
[19:30:41] <indomitable> I'm not sure that's the case for younger generations now
[19:30:44] <stenno> and corona deniers
[19:30:47] <indomitable> Ugh
[19:30:58] <indomitable> Hope I get my third dose soon
[19:31:04] <indomitable> Lots of deniers dying in hospitals at the moment
[19:31:31] <indomitable> Most people who have been vaccinated and get hospitalized are like 70-80 years old. The ones who aren't are on average 50..
[19:31:39] <indomitable> That means a lot of fairly young people are going in because of stupidity
[19:36:51] *** stenno is now known as stenno\OK
[19:39:55] <akronymus[m]> <indomitable> "I'm sure he'll walk. But he's..." <- people still think he killef poc's
[19:40:07] <indomitable> don't care who he killed
[19:40:22] <indomitable> you can be a white nationalist and kill people who are white :s
[19:40:55] <indomitable> it may surprise you that during ww2, a lot of people who died fighting the nazis weren't jews or any of the groups they dislike
[19:52:23] <akronymus[m]> <indomitable> "I know the facts are: he didn'..." <- Your fact source is garbage, then.  
[19:52:46] <indomitable> facts are from the trial 
[19:52:47] <indomitable> sigh
[19:52:55] <indomitable> stick to functions, real life is not for you
[19:53:21] <akronymus[m]> I literally got the facts from the court room feed
[19:56:20] <indomitable> alternative facts maybe
[19:56:25] <indomitable> trumpists often enjoy those
[19:56:53] <indomitable> I've got to go, enjoy what ever right wing fascist thing you're watching
[19:58:48] <akronymus[m]> guess the unedited live feed of zhe court is right wing fascist then. And I dont even like trump
[19:59:07] <akronymus[m]> fucking phone keyboard.
[20:23:04] <Deide> > He wasn't supposed to be armed to begin with
[20:23:04] <Deide> Speaking as a non-American with no experience of weaponry, when is one supposed to be armed?

[20:23:20] <Deide> Speaking as a non-American with no experience of weaponry, when is one supposed to be armed?
[20:23:58] <stenno\OK> err
[20:25:44] <Deide> Does this also mean that having armed security counts as instigation? It's very confusing.
[20:26:59] <akronymus[m]> Accoeding to the logic, armed police called to a stabbing is the instigator.
[20:28:27] <Deide> What if you're a journalist reporting on a genocide in a war-torn country, and are armed for protection?
[20:28:41] <akronymus[m]> Same logic.
[20:28:51] <akronymus[m]> Which, is absurd.
[20:29:17] <akronymus[m]> Hence that logic being an invalid path to go down.
[20:30:22] <akronymus[m]> If you fuck with a HV electric fence you can easily die.
[20:30:41] <akronymus[m]> It is there as a deterrance so you dont fuck with it in the fiest place
[20:30:58] <akronymus[m]> Because under the same logic, it would also be instigation.
[20:32:23] <akronymus[m]> > <@deide:matrix.org> > He wasn't supposed to be armed to begin with
[20:32:23] <akronymus[m]> > 
[20:32:23] <akronymus[m]> > Speaking as a non-American with no experience of weaponry, when is one supposed to be armed?
[20:32:23] <akronymus[m]> Whenever you please, unless in certain cases. Such as being a felon, being on privaze property where the owner said no guns and auch things.
[20:35:14] <akronymus[m]> I am unsure of all the exceptions though. 
[20:36:28] <akronymus[m]> https://www.lawyers.com/legal-info/criminal/the-second-amendment-and-the-right-to-bear-arms.html#:~:text=Restrictions%20on%20Some%20Gun%20Owners&text=people%20who've%20been%20committed,the%20country%20under%20nonimmigrant%20visas
[20:50:21] <Deide> I understand why gun ownership is big in the US, but I've never considered that it means regular people are carrying guns in any instance outside of a threat to you or your family/friends. I just assumed people "keep" guns as part as their cultural heritage (and to dissuade total tyranny).
[20:50:22] <Deide> But then, I guess you can never be certain of when a threat might happen across you in public (I'd say more so here in Europe than in America, ironically), so there's some sense to it, I suppose. I don't think I'm a fan of there being no examination or course though (typically a resulting in a license), even if it was just a culturally-instilled thing.
[20:50:22] <Deide> I guess if all things are well, the parents and the surrounding family/community would take on that responsibility and foster that culture.
[20:51:21] <akronymus[m]> What do you mean examination/course?
[20:51:38] <Deide> Actually, I think I retract that comparison to Europe since I was only thinking in terms of terrorism and nothing else.
[20:51:59] <Deide> A course like a driving test/examination.
[20:52:01] <akronymus[m]> Because to acquire a gun you have to go through a background check and have completed a course in gun safety/handling.
[20:52:52] <Deide> Oh I see. I thought there were a bunch of states where you could just purchase and carry according to the constitution and nothing more.
[20:53:13] <akronymus[m]> Oh, some are. Not sure about wisconsin, actually.
[20:53:33] <akronymus[m]> In most states it isnt easy to get one though.
[20:53:57] <Deide> Makes sense.
[20:54:12] <akronymus[m]> Ok, wisconsin is a right to carry.
[20:54:14] <Deide> Technically you can easily be lethal with a car even
[20:54:35] <akronymus[m]> A skateboard is a deadly weapon as well.
[20:54:49] <akronymus[m]> Even fists count, in a lot of cases.
[20:55:31] <Deide> I'd imagine the metal trucks on a skateboard would hurt quite a lot, yeah
[20:55:57] <akronymus[m]> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_laws_in_Wisconsin
[20:56:34] <akronymus[m]> If you get attacked with a skateboard and shoot in response, would you deem that self defense?
[20:56:40] <Deide> But regarding cars, every now and then when I'm walking down the road and there's a fast-moving car coming opposite, I darkly think to myself "wow, it would be so easy for them to swerve at me and kill me".
[20:56:44] <akronymus[m]> As in, already got hit.

[20:59:18] <Deide> Hm, depends I think. If the skateboard is thrown, I'd say it does not warrant shooting back (maybe shooting in the air as a warning? Or is that actually a dumb thing to do unlike in movies?). If you're in the process of being attacked with the apparent intention of incapacitation, I'd feel like shooting is warranted.
[21:00:13] <akronymus[m]> Warning shots are reckless endangerment and INCREDIBLY illegal
[21:00:15] <stenno\OK> if someone points a _gun_ at me i will do _everything_ to not get shot
[21:00:26] <Deide> The first response should be to get away though, I think
[21:00:33] <stenno\OK> because my _life_ is under immediate threat
[21:00:47] <Deide> Yeah, I'd agree with that
[21:00:50] <akronymus[m]> If you are on your back from being hit by the skateboard?
[21:01:15] <stenno\OK> likewise, if i carry a weapon, i put my own life at risk
[21:01:17] <akronymus[m]> And see a person advancing on you?
[21:01:36] <stenno\OK> because others might perceive that as a threat to their lives
[21:02:11] <Deide> I think what spooks me about a gun is missing and hitting someone else during some close-quarters frantic moment
[21:02:16] <akronymus[m]> That, I disagree with, stenno.
[21:02:30] <stenno\OK> nothing will be better from me carrying a weapon
[21:03:24] <akronymus[m]> Also: the thing I laid out, that was the situation eittenhouse was in.
[21:03:34] <akronymus[m]> rittenhouse*
[21:04:12] <akronymus[m]> He was running away from people advancing on him.
[21:04:20] <Deide> In an ideal world, the person would announce that they're armed to deter violence, rather than using it to escape active violence.
[21:04:23] <stenno\OK> ok?
[21:04:34] <akronymus[m]> Thats what the visible gun is for.
[21:04:49] <Deide> Makes sense
[21:04:54] <akronymus[m]> You have it as deterrence. And hope you dont have to use it
[21:04:56] <stenno\OK> so he would be killed if he didn't have a gun?
[21:05:10] <stenno\OK> its YOUR responsibility with a gun to keep a clear head
[21:06:02] <akronymus[m]> Kyle was trying to disengage.
[21:06:05] <stenno\OK> the risk that someone even only mis-judges the situation and _kills_ someone
[21:06:16] <stenno\OK> disengage
[21:06:27] <akronymus[m]> He got prevented from it by a skateboard to the head.
[21:06:29] <stenno\OK> what would have happened with him if he didn't have a gun?
[21:06:39] <akronymus[m]> Hed probably be dead.
[21:06:50] <stenno\OK> i doubt it
[21:07:09] <akronymus[m]> Because they started chasing/attacking him after rittenhouse put out a dumpsterfire
[21:07:19] <stenno\OK> maybe they were attacking him because they felt that their life was in danger because he was carrying an assault rifle?
[21:07:40] <akronymus[m]> Then they have a duty to retreat
[21:07:47] <akronymus[m]> Same as with rittenhouse
[21:08:06] <akronymus[m]> Which rottenhouse did to the best of his abilities
[21:08:13] <akronymus[m]> ritten*
[21:08:37] <stenno\OK> if some civilian carried a weapon in my vicinity, i would immediately feel under threat
[21:08:49] <stenno\OK> my own life would depend on the calmness of that civilian
[21:08:54] <akronymus[m]> Then get out of that situation
[21:09:22] <stenno\OK> sure but maybe also they just couldn't carry a fucking murder weapon as a civilian
[21:09:31] <Deide> Yeah, I think the normal response is not to attack, but to de-escalate. (that said, I don't know much about that trial or whatever it is)
[21:09:46] <akronymus[m]> The people that got shot had A LOT of oppurtunitiats to leave rather than charge/chase rittenhouse
[21:09:48] <Deide> Attacking would erode any calmness
[21:09:54] <stenno\OK> again, if my life is under threat, i will do anything
[21:10:01] <stenno\OK> i am not calm already in that situation
[21:10:19] <stenno\OK> if a civilian was waving a gun, i cannot at all rely on them being sensible
[21:10:37] <akronymus[m]> If someone has a fun loosely hanging by a chest strap, do yoh feel in danger?
[21:10:44] <akronymus[m]> No hand on the gun
[21:10:54] <stenno\OK> i don't know what a chest strap is
[21:10:58] <Deide> I think running at a person with a gun is probably going to make it more likely you get shot.
[21:11:06] <stenno\OK> any civilian with any gun
[21:11:25] <akronymus[m]> Basically a strap so you can hang it in front of your chest like with a laptop bag
[21:11:34] <Deide> To be honest, I'd feel tension if there was a visible gun (just like I sometimes do with the car)
[21:12:02] <stenno\OK> i was threatened by a police man with a gun once and it was one of the worst experiences in my life
[21:12:22] <stenno\OK> apparently this is just everyday life in other countries
[21:12:26] <akronymus[m]> I'd highly recommend watching the actual trial feed. there are quite a few recoedings of it unedited.
[21:12:36] <Deide> Like with the car, I would not want to leap into the road, hoping I slow it down or stop it. I'd rather stay vigilant and aware of any change in the circumstances.
[21:12:42] <akronymus[m]> Yes, threatening with a gun is bad.
[21:13:14] <akronymus[m]> Having a gun, that alone isnt thrwatening.
[21:13:27] <stenno\OK> but i know that a police person has a long training so they know what they are doing (at least in germany)
[21:13:41] <stenno\OK> i cannot conclude anything from a civilian with a gun
[21:14:00] <stenno\OK> he might be drunk, or he might have mental issues, or anything
[21:14:01] <Deide> Yeah, it's a lot different in Europe
[21:14:08] <akronymus[m]> In the VAST majority of cases, lefal gun owners are very well trained.
[21:14:24] <stenno\OK> akronymus[m]: in the US?
[21:14:29] <stenno\OK> lmao
[21:14:35] <Deide> Arms aren't part of the culture here whatsoever
[21:14:44] <akronymus[m]> And mental issues make you ineligible to carry a gun.
[21:15:19] <stenno\OK> maybe he asked his wife to lend him her gun? who knows
[21:15:32] <akronymus[m]> And afaik being dumb with a gun gets you a felony VERY quickly. Which would make you ineligible as well.
[21:15:40] <Deide> I would imagine that a rifle owner in America is more well trained with the rifle than your average policeman in Europe, but I'm pulling that imagination straight out of my backside, so who knows.
[21:15:41] <akronymus[m]> Then he has it illegally.
[21:15:45] <stenno\OK> that is too late
[21:16:02] <akronymus[m]> Most owners regularily go to the shooting range.
[21:16:22] <stenno\OK> and going to the shooting range emotionally prepares you to act calm under threat?
[21:16:31] <stenno\OK> or does it just make you a more precise shooter
[21:16:41] <akronymus[m]> Both.
[21:17:01] <akronymus[m]> Knowing how it works makes you calmer.
[21:17:02] <stenno\OK> i didn't know there was also psychological advice and evaluations in those gun ranges
[21:17:10] <stenno\OK> i thought you'd just go there with a gun and shoot
[21:17:33] <akronymus[m]> You do.
[21:17:35] <Deide> One exception I know of in Europe is Switzerland. It has a very strong gun culture.
[21:18:09] <stenno\OK> in switzerland, a soldier can take their gun home after service
[21:18:14] <akronymus[m]> But any small mistake in handling the gun safely is bound to get you kicked out/reported
[21:18:28] <Deide> That's pretty cool
[21:18:44] <stenno\OK> a soldier has rigorous training (in germany)
[21:18:52] <stenno\OK> both physically and psychologically
[21:20:35] <Deide> It probably does help to have national service
[21:23:26] <Deide> It's funny, I didn't like the idea of national service at all when I was young, but as I've gotten older, I feel like having that structure and discipline (both mentally and physically as stenno points out) at an early age would be a real boon to most people.
[21:23:26] <Deide> I guess it doesn't necessarily have to be *military* service, but it sure does help if you want to nurture a respectful gun culture.
[21:23:51] <stenno\OK> talking about _gun_ discipline specifically
[21:24:15] <Deide> To be honest, I didn't like the idea of writing software commercially when I was young either
[21:25:09] <stenno\OK> do you mean selling your software? or having a job in which you write software
[21:25:15] <Deide> So much so that I chose an Aerospace course at Uni instead of anything computer science related
[21:25:43] <Deide> I mean having a job in which you write the software that other people want (so, selling it).
[21:26:15] <akronymus[m]> Contracting?
[21:27:02] <stenno\OK> i am happy that i can make money with my hobby 
[21:27:34] <akronymus[m]> tbh, the change in topic is kinda welcome at this point.
[21:27:45] <Deide> Either way. The important part to me was having to build (or learn) software that I wasn't interested in. But like my thoughts on national service, I've grown a more eclectic appreciation for programming in general since then.
[21:27:45] <akronymus[m]> Thanks for having a productive discussion
[21:27:54] <akronymus[m]> stenno\OKand Deide 
[21:28:02] <stenno\OK> agreed
[21:28:54] <akronymus[m]> While there still are certain disagreements you were quite pleasant to talk to.
[21:29:25] <stenno\OK> Deide: i think you have to find your own way even when working as a programmer
[21:29:40] <stenno\OK> you are correct in that you cannot always choose your environment
[21:34:28] <Deide> Yeah, I agree
