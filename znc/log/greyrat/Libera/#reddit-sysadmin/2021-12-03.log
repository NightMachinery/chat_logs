[04:22:12] <CableNinja> well yeah sleep is kind of a requirement
[04:22:29] <sd> 11<t​elgareith> a twitchy doctor can commit you for that
[04:22:31] <CableNinja> shit happens. if it happens often just start making sure you write down what you're doing as you do it somewhere, like a work journal

[04:27:28] <sd> 07<F​lyingsky> I had 30
[04:27:33] <sd> 07<F​lyingsky> I got it down to 19
[04:27:52] <xe0n> your service desk manager is the first person you speak to and ask for assistance
[04:27:55] <CableNinja> smh... I used to crank out 50-90 tickets a week sometimes..
[04:27:59] <xe0n> and if you can't prioritise it yourself, ask him too
[04:28:48] <xe0n> as long as there's sufficient notes in the ticket re: from you, whether that is you reached out to X, no response, make sure that's noted, and set the ticket to pending
[04:29:10] <sd> 07<F​lyingsky> I really want to quit, it's so difficult.
[04:29:10] <sd> 07<F​lyingsky> I know technology and can handle the tech side of things, I can learn quickly and solve things methodically.
[04:29:10] <sd> 07<F​lyingsky> But a work environment makes me perform very badly for some reason
[04:29:27] <sd> 07<F​lyingsky> 50-90 tickets is a lot
[04:29:34] <sd> 11<t​elgareith> depends
[04:29:47] <xe0n> sounds like your department is under resourced
[04:30:38] <CableNinja> that 50-90 tickets was in a web hosting / colo hosting support env as L1/L2 support
[04:31:03] <sd> 07<F​lyingsky> I'm already using a lot of notes in tickets, there's no time where I do not add additional info to the time entries.
[04:31:03] <sd> 07<F​lyingsky> Also I made it so that all mail conversations are recorded in the ticket
[04:31:06] <sd> 11<t​elgareith> yea so a bunch of those took longer to read than fix
[04:32:19] <sd> 07<F​lyingsky> @xe0n, yes... We are like 4 people for over 200 customers and we're basically the ones for everything...
[04:32:28] <CableNinja> even still. it was just me on graveyard shift by myself for 4 years at 2 different companies. that meant also being remote hands for people as well, and doing installs/upgrades,etc
[04:32:37] <sd> 07<F​lyingsky> They just lost 2 employees this month
[04:32:42] <sd> 07<F​lyingsky> I'm about to leave too tbh..
[04:32:52] <sd> 07<F​lyingsky> I slowly have enough of this
[04:32:57] <xe0n> yup under resourced, impossible to have 4 people manage 200 odd customers
[04:33:07] <xe0n> and keep your sanity
[04:33:31] <sd> 07<F​lyingsky> I mean maybe it's a little bit my fault too for communicating too little and not handling things how I should, being a bit lazy at times too
[04:33:44] <sd> 07<F​lyingsky> But I just have no energy anymore
[04:33:59] <xe0n> then take a break and work on your time management?
[04:34:05] <xe0n> and make sure you're communicating all things
[04:34:23] <xe0n> the idea is with tickets you should have enough notes in there so someone else can pickup the ticket and carry on if that needs to happen
[04:35:13] <sd> 07<F​lyingsky> They should be able too, since I document where I left off, what still needed to be done and conversations with customers are there too, so they know what was exchanged
[04:35:25] <xe0n> nice
[04:35:46] <xe0n> either way, sounds like your management need to acknowlege you dont have enough resources, and should hire more people
[04:36:36] <sd> 07<F​lyingsky> They tried to hire more people.
[04:36:36] <sd> 07<F​lyingsky> But 2 of the people that have been hired left this month, just a few months after being hired
[04:37:02] <sd> 11<t​elgareith> then engage idgaf mode
[04:37:03] <sd> 11<t​elgareith> tbh
[04:37:36] <xe0n> yup and that should show management something isn't right
[04:37:40] <sd> 07<F​lyingsky> This all overwhelms me to be honest
[04:37:41] <sd> 07<F​lyingsky> I need to think about time management, take things slower because like this I'm just unnecessarily stressed and worry instead of doing
[04:37:49] <xe0n> yup
[04:38:01] <sd> 11<t​elgareith> yea
[04:39:41] <xe0n> first thing is dont give up sleep, make sure you sleep

[07:02:21] <signalblue> Haven't looked into it
[07:02:23] <Church> Yep

[07:15:59] <signalblue> Is there any ISPs providing a *gigabyte* connection?
[07:16:08] <Hunterkll> sure
[07:16:10] <Hunterkll> it's called 10gig
[07:16:11] <Hunterkll> :D
[07:16:18] <signalblue> I mean fine
[07:16:23] <signalblue> I asked for ISPs
[07:16:37] <sd> 11<t​elgareith> yes...
[07:16:43] <Hunterkll> hurricane electric, century link/level3, comcast, windstream, etc.....
[07:16:52] <signalblue> Ah so not Verizon
[07:16:57] <Hunterkll> oh verizon for sure
[07:17:01] <signalblue> This is for residential use
[07:17:03] <Hunterkll> just not any service you'd be able to afford
[07:17:10] <signalblue> ...........
[07:17:11] <sd> 11<t​elgareith> idk the ISP but I have a canadian friend who has 10gig to his house
[07:17:13] <Hunterkll> that's "pay them to run a leased line to your house" territory 
[07:17:19] <sd> 11<t​elgareith> ^
[07:17:22] <Hunterkll> direct from the CO/exchange
[07:17:27] <signalblue> I can afford it its just that the value isn't there
[07:17:36] <sd> 11<t​elgareith> for my guy it is
[07:17:38] <Hunterkll> highest speed commercial residential service would probably be comcast's 2gig FTTP offering
[07:17:45] <sd> 11<t​elgareith> because he keeps the backups for a video CDN in his basement
[07:17:46] <signalblue> 2gig is slow
[07:17:55] <Hunterkll> but to get 10gig here would be a couple thousand a month plus maybe $20-50k installation fees
[07:18:16] <signalblue> It doesn't cost them that much to make it work
[07:18:19] <signalblue> LOL
[07:18:33] <signalblue> Installation fees = cost to run cable
[07:18:38] <signalblue> Which I can understand
[07:18:43] <Hunterkll> they have to physically run the fiber from the CO/POP to my house, which would be a leased / dedicated line, which includes the permitting, a few miles of cable, etc 
[07:18:51] <Hunterkll> and then the service costs itself 
[07:18:53] <Hunterkll> among other things
[07:19:01] <signalblue> You don't have dark fiber?
[07:19:10] <Hunterkll> i'm in a bloody residential farming valley
[07:19:11] <Hunterkll> lol
[07:19:21] <signalblue> The service costs itself... shouldn't be what they are
[07:19:24] <Hunterkll> we're fucking lucky to have cable internet
[07:19:27] <signalblue> lol
[07:19:50] <Hunterkll> signalblue: 10gig runs about $700-1k/mo inside of a datacenter if you're ri ght where the service provider's pop is 
[07:19:54] <signalblue> Wait so otherwise it's dial up for you?
[07:19:57] <Hunterkll> then there's thi ngs like the router/NID/etc rental
[07:20:03] <Hunterkll> costs
[07:20:06] <Hunterkll> which are built into the service fee
[07:20:13] <signalblue> I own routers/infra
[07:20:19] <signalblue> But yes I get your point
[07:20:21] <Hunterkll> you need to use the ISP provided equipment

[07:23:29] <Church> Cool as fuck but honestly?
[07:23:35] <Church> Most of your kit is probably home bound.
[07:23:39] <Hunterkll> i know in 2003-2005 we were using things like dialup with RRAS router, eventually using ISA on sserver 2003 on a laptop with a verizon air card, before we got cable again

[07:26:55] <Hunterkll> just like cable
[07:27:04] <signalblue> true
[07:27:06] <Hunterkll> you could have 16 users on a 10gig circuit all with "10gig" speeds

[07:27:54] <Hunterkll> the 10gig service i was talking about was straight, dedicated, leased circuit 10/10

[07:30:00] <signalblue> !down 5
[07:30:00] <DoTheNeedful> signalblue: your downvote has been applied to quote #5.
[07:30:16] <Hunterkll> specifically note - Rates and charges set forth below apply to Internet Dedicated Services in the U.S. Mainland under Verizon Business Services II, and do not include local access circuit charges, charges for extended wiring to or at Customer premises, equipment costs, or network application fees.
[07:30:32] <Hunterkll> and of course, it doesn't include things like negotiated feese/discounts/etc
[07:31:17] <Hunterkll> it's an old fee schedule, but yea
[07:31:29] <Hunterkll> it was like triple the price to upgrade our 10mbit circuit at one office to 50mbit
[07:31:33] <signalblue> OC12 monthly is expensive
[07:31:33] <Hunterkll> and that circuit was supporting 150 users
[07:31:34] <Hunterkll> lol
[07:32:50] <fritzwastaken> s/circuit/vag that c1's mom has
[07:32:51] <layer8> Hunterkll meant: "and that vag that c1's mom has was supporting 150 users"
[07:33:02] <signalblue> OC48 even more so
[07:33:06] <Hunterkll> here's a more recent one (2015) with better pricing breakdowns and costs for new jersey - https://www.state.nj.us/treasury/purchase/pdf/T1776/Verizon/Sched_L_Internet_11_20_2015.pdf
[07:33:16] <signalblue> But that's the cost of dedicated fiber
[07:33:31] <signalblue> Who the HECK is paying that? IDK
[07:33:44] <Hunterkll> pretty much any building/office with this type of service
[07:33:46] <Hunterkll> which is a  *lot* 
[07:33:47] <signalblue> Don't want to know either...
[07:33:55] <signalblue> Well of course Hunter
[07:34:15] <signalblue> That's like saying anyone who is paying for this is paying for it
[07:34:27] <signalblue> 1+1 = 1+1
[07:34:29] <Hunterkll> i mean
[07:34:59] <signalblue> We talking $1M/monthly
[07:35:12] <Hunterkll> all our offices and datacenters are using level 3/centurylink (they merged, hilariously, so now it's not really redundant providers), with often last mile connectivity (cable run from PoP) provided by windstream/verizon/AT&T 
[07:35:26] <Hunterkll> that's a few hundred sites right there

[13:07:30] <Hunterkll> the servers haven't been up long enough for that to happen

[13:08:15] <Hunterkll> the others only come into play when servers are *actually* at capacity
[13:08:21] <Hunterkll> to reduce issues, they only process X logins/second 
[13:08:33] <Hunterkll> and only allow a maximum logical DC auth queue of 17k

[16:06:14] <Hunterkll> yea, no
[16:06:18] <rpifan> as a support for the normal medical pros
[16:06:27] <rpifan> the fact is we need more doctors / nurses 
[16:06:35] <rpifan> but we can convince most ppl do that kind of dr as it sucks
[16:06:40] <Hunterkll> no to both of that - you want actual trained medical doctors compiling the data to feed into these AI engines
[16:06:42] <Hunterkll> not IT people
[16:06:43] <Hunterkll> lol
[16:06:50] <Hunterkll> the IT people tell the doctors how to stick in said data

[16:11:06] <Hunterkll> mainly: You have to be able to handle that Skyhawk with an altimiter or something else with a fault just as well as a fully automated landing in a 747 
[16:11:13] <rpifan> eventually after he got better he ran the study and in fact its better to remove them slowly but to this day all medical ppl still just yank them

[16:20:39] <Hunterkll> i'd have to see the aircraft model/report but either way
[16:20:48] <sd> 11<t​elgareith> lemmie try and find it
[16:20:55] <sd> 11<t​elgareith> if you gaf
[16:20:56] <Hunterkll> in a mid-flight scenario i don't care if i'm wasting fuel on an inoperative engine 
[16:21:10] <Hunterkll> in a test scenario, i'd rather not have shit get all funked up
[16:21:11] <Hunterkll> lol
[16:21:31] <Hunterkll> but then again, you should be able to disable the fuel pumps etc as well
[16:21:47] <Hunterkll> via toggle siwtches, but then that'll triger conditions/faults in the flight software that'll do other things, etc
[16:21:52] <sd> 11<t​elgareith> yea this was 100% preventable
[16:21:54] <Hunterkll> so it's kinda meh

[16:23:20] <Hunterkll> heh
[16:23:24] <Hunterkll> well, that's pretty damn bad
[16:23:32] <Hunterkll> but 12 hour shifts aren't a problem
[16:23:33] <Hunterkll> lol
[16:23:37] <rpifan> yes they are
[16:23:42] <rpifan> no one should be working 12 hour shifts
[16:23:46] <rpifan> humans arent designed for that shit
[16:23:52] <Hunterkll> that's total bullshit
[16:23:55] <rpifan> after 8 hours your judgement is like being drunk
[16:24:05] <Hunterkll> that's not even close to true
[16:24:05] <rpifan> Hunterkll, unless you are eating up panzerschokolade
[16:24:17] <Hunterkll> this is a rather well studied phenomenom 
[16:24:19] <Hunterkll> https://www.jstor.org/stable/40966839
[16:24:38] <Hunterkll> if you're sleeping properly/reguarly, it's a non-issue
[16:24:44] <Hunterkll> my mom works 3 12 hour shifts a week and thats it lol 
[16:25:17] <rpifan> yea id rather have a nurse / doctor / medical professiaonl that has only worked 8 hours
[16:25:34] <Hunterkll> wouldn't bother me as long as they're not out partying all night before
[16:25:53] <rpifan> i mean for sure ive had projects where ive sat and worked on them for over 12 hours continously 
[16:25:56] <Hunterkll> now for *night shift*
[16:26:00] <Hunterkll> that's a different perspective
[16:26:03] <Hunterkll> i'm talking morning/day shift crew
[16:26:08] <rpifan> but it gets to a point where you are so focused and so disconnected from that world
[16:26:10] <Hunterkll> those shifts are usually shorter
[16:26:11] <rpifan> its not so great
[16:26:30] <rpifan> well they usually send the jr drs on 12 hour night shifts
[16:26:43] <sd> 11<t​elgareith> its amazing how much better of a mood i'm in not having to deal with work

[16:26:56] <Hunterkll> but 12 hour shifts aren't inherintly bad if done properly 
[16:27:15] <Hunterkll> and you're not constantly changing sleep patterns/schedules
[16:27:24] <CoJaBo> So this is pretty amusing. Last year, someone created a fake Belle Delpine account to mess with us. Apparently it got hacked, as it is now desperately trying to convince me that my dear close friend Ms. Delpine is at Walmart right now needing $200 to fix a flat tire and lost her debt (sic) card and is about to be arrested if she doesn't pay within the next 15 minutes.

[16:27:55] <SirSceptalot> HELP THE POOR GIRL YOU MONSTER
[16:27:59] <Hunterkll> but yea the problem with 12-hour shifts is the people who gte raked over with them, etc 
[16:28:10] <Hunterkll> and when they're abused instead of implemented properly

If you call someone and transmit the CNAM data from your point of origon (aka your telco's database sends it) and they're using a different CNAM database, you might have an entirely different display item show up on their phone without any control other than finding/hassling the CNAM data vendor

[17:54:00] <fritzwastaken> but i did
[17:54:03] <Hunterkll> rpifan: you've been living in europe too long people here dont talk about that sorta thing
[17:54:06] <fritzwastaken> it just turns into a dick sharing competition
[17:54:13] <fritzwastaken> of course some people here dont
[17:54:14] <rpifan> Hunterkll, really? could be
[17:54:15] <fritzwastaken> and some people do
[17:54:29] <fritzwastaken> s/sharing/size
[17:54:30] <Hunterkll> yea discussing pay and pay related things is a social taboo in america
[17:54:30] <layer8> fritzwastaken meant: "it just turns into a dick size competition"
[17:54:38] <fritzwastaken> A lot of people here make a lot of money, and some dont
[17:54:43] <Hunterkll> unlike a lot of europe where it's commonly done to ensure fairness and shit
[17:54:58] <rpifan> well honestly most of the jobs i had in the Us were small thing i only had one or two formal office jobs, ive worked in more formal jobs here
[17:55:02] <rpifan> yea
[17:55:06] <fritzwastaken> Its just not a constructive IRC conversation
[17:55:14] <rpifan> in fact at the momment sine im the HR team i actually see everyones salary

[17:56:15] <Hunterkll> yea it's funny like
[17:56:22] <Hunterkll> a lot of companies have policies of not discussing that shit and like
[17:56:31] <Hunterkll> but it's actually federally illegal to prevent employees from discussing wages
[17:56:37] <Hunterkll> but a lot of companies don't want you to know that
[17:56:41] <Hunterkll> and go out of their way to make sure you don't hear it
[17:56:49] <rpifan> its the american way
[17:56:52] <xe0n> just look at apple, they closed the slack channel!
[17:56:53] <xe0n> lol :P
[17:56:54] <rpifan> like jury nullification

[17:57:52] <PublicWiFi> i can't wait till I get Jury Duty
[17:58:07] <rpifan> i think for severe cases they use two judges at the same time instead of a jury
[17:58:17] <rpifan> PublicWiFi, yes but you cant tell the prosecutor you plan to nullify
[17:58:22] <rpifan> if you do they will remove you from the panel
[17:58:23] <PublicWiFi> you sure cant
[17:58:30] <rpifan> you will get removed
[17:58:39] <PublicWiFi> I have a dream of being that one jury member
[17:58:43] <PublicWiFi> that's holding them all up
[17:58:52] <PublicWiFi> explaining why I'm not gonna give that person a guilty charge
[17:58:55] <rpifan> as my lawyer once told me, we cant pick jurors but we can disqualify them
[17:59:01] <PublicWiFi> ofc unless they did it xD
[17:59:16] <rpifan> PublicWiFi, yea but dont tell that to the person interviewing you
[17:59:20] <PublicWiFi> ofc not
[17:59:23] <rpifan> you will be grilled before you even get to a juror
[18:00:46] <SirSceptalot> jury nullification?
[18:01:02] <PublicWiFi> yeee
[18:01:17] <SirSceptalot> is that one or the other side saying they don't like the face of someone in the jury, and now they can't play?
[18:01:29] <PublicWiFi> aka the jury realizes the person is guilty of a crime, but they think the law is bullshit and so they choose not to convict
[18:01:39] <PublicWiFi> like weed possession laws and etc
[18:01:46] <rpifan> yea but you arent allowed to speak about it all
[18:01:48] <rpifan> you cant mention it
[18:01:50] <PublicWiFi> nope

[18:16:16] <Haise0> not yet lol
[18:16:30] <DrZak> when you go on a plain and your luggage is too heavy, you take some shit out and put it into the carry on
[18:16:34] <DrZak> which goes on the same plane
[18:16:36] <DrZak> ..
[18:16:45] <Hunterkll> DrZak: it's about balance as well as weight
[18:16:55] <PublicWiFi> ^
[18:17:05] <Hunterkll> and yes, there are technically weight limits for carryon
[18:17:05] <Hunterkll> lol
[18:17:12] <PublicWiFi> ive been on a plane once where it was kind of back heavy and they asked people to move up front
[18:17:13] <DrZak> yea i know
[18:17:22] <sintax> haha
[18:17:23] <Hunterkll> if five people move to the back then the pilot has to adjust trim to compensate, lol
[18:17:24] <Hunterkll> yea

[18:20:03] <PublicWiFi> why tf does my vendor want to know my "current os version" when quoting me windows 10 volume licenses
[18:20:04] <PublicWiFi> -.-
[18:20:09] <DrZak> but but but .. YES
[18:20:10] <DrZak> olk
[18:20:14] <sintax> PublicWiFi: because $version
[18:20:18] <PublicWiFi> -.-
[18:20:26] <Hunterkll> PublicWiFi: because volume license for client OS is upgrade only
[18:20:40] <PublicWiFi> wtf does that mean
[18:20:41] <Hunterkll> and if you don't have a qualifying edition (say, you have home and you're trying to buy VL) then you have to buy the base license + VL 
[18:20:44] <PublicWiFi> why can't microsoft be normal
[18:20:45] <sintax> do any of you have the comptia security+ cert?
[18:20:52] <PublicWiFi> sintax: i do 
[18:20:55] <Hunterkll> IE: If you're buying  Win10 Pro, you need to have Win7 Pro (or better) 
[18:20:59] <sintax> PublicWiFi: how'd you study for it?
[18:21:02] <Hunterkll> if you have Win7 Home, then you can't buy VL
[18:21:04] <Hunterkll> it's upgrade only
[18:21:07] <PublicWiFi> so
[18:21:17] <PublicWiFi> what's the best way to just get 5 win10 licenses lol
[18:21:20] <PublicWiFi> fuckin amazon?
[18:21:23] <sintax> PublicWiFi: ebay
[18:21:28] <Hunterkll> PublicWiFi: what's this for?

[18:22:00] <Hunterkll> that's even more fun

[18:22:28] <PublicWiFi> ofc course
[18:22:39] <xe0n> yes my son?
[18:22:44] <Hunterkll> if you build a whitebox, and you want to use Win10 enterprise, you have two options
[18:22:47] <PublicWiFi> xe0n: LOL
[18:22:51] <Hunterkll> buy Win10 Pro retail, and Win10 Enterprise VL
[18:22:56] <Hunterkll> or buy an M365 subscription

[18:23:24] <mistiry> hm
[18:23:28] <DrZak> Microsoft 365
[18:23:35] <DrZak> if you have Office 365 you need windows license
[18:23:35] <PublicWiFi> sintax: I was attending WGU so they provided ITprotv vids and online book :S
[18:23:38] <Hunterkll> it's actually a lower barrier to entry for SMBs to get into the enterprise SKU game
[18:23:52] <xe0n> sku u
[18:23:55] <Hunterkll> then traditional VL
[18:23:57] <sintax> PublicWiFi: well then. thanks. I'll buy the book and i've got linkedin learning videos...
[18:23:59] <sintax> this should be fun
[18:24:01] <PublicWiFi> microsoft licenses is a fucking shitshow lol
[18:24:10] <Hunterkll> this is really easy shit
[18:24:10] <xe0n> this is why your vendor is asking you the question
[18:24:11] <Hunterkll> lol
[18:24:14] <xe0n> so they can do the work for you...

[18:27:36] <SantaGibby> HO HO HO MOTHER FUCKERS
[18:27:48] <Hunterkll> PublicWiFi: now, if you want to do this the EASY way 
[18:27:50] <mistiry> use Azure and the W10 images they have and use that license :D
[18:27:54] <Hunterkll> IE: Not have to manage a shitload of keys
[18:27:54] <xe0n> :DDD
[18:27:58] <xe0n> AVD YOOOO
[18:28:00] <PublicWiFi> awww shit
[18:28:00] <sintax> ubuntu...go with debian
[18:28:01] <mistiry> plus you can get multi-user W10 in Azure
[18:28:03] <sintax> nood

[18:28:23] <xe0n> OH RHELLLYYYY
[18:28:26] <Hunterkll> PublicWiFi: buy all the retail pro licenses you need to cover the home machines, then get *one* copy of Win10 Pro VL
[18:28:26] <sintax> real men use ARCH
[18:28:28] <PublicWiFi> my chest isn't hairy enough for RHEL
[18:28:34] <sintax> haha
[18:28:44] <PublicWiFi> Hunterkll: I need 1 copy to make my WDS setup kosher lol
[18:28:45] <xe0n> "wait she bought chromebooks"
[18:28:46] <Hunterkll> PublicWiFi: then, you can reimage all the Win10 Pro licensed machines using that single VL key 
[18:28:50] <PublicWiFi> :D
[18:28:54] <Hunterkll> reimaging rights ftw
[18:28:57] <PublicWiFi> yup
[18:29:05] <Hunterkll> you're covered for edition and base OS license, so then you're just set to use standard imaging
[18:29:06] <Hunterkll> lol
[18:29:08] <PublicWiFi> im def not compliant with my current imaging setup
[18:29:19] * mistiry calls BSA
[18:29:22] <xe0n> AAAAAAAACKKKKKKSHALLLLYYYYYYYY
[18:29:22] <PublicWiFi> xD
[18:29:35] <sintax> yay mistiry made $200 being a snitch haha
[18:29:37] <xe0n> im on beerOS atm
[18:29:38] <PublicWiFi> I mean the machines are all OEM so they get their license backup via digital activation or whatever
[18:29:44] <PublicWiFi> but I dont have the single VL license to do it "right"
[18:29:50] <PublicWiFi> microsoft is a joke xD

[18:30:42] <mistiry> macos VDI?
[18:30:54] <Hunterkll> mistiry: ya it's something we're fleshing out for a dev team 
[18:30:58] <Hunterkll> it's quite legit/legal 
[18:31:01] <mistiry> since when could you virtualize mac (legally)?
[18:31:05] <sintax> hmm apparently my home lab server with intel v2 cpu' and 384gb of ram is worth $1200 on ebay....
[18:31:11] <Hunterkll> mistiry: on apple hardware
[18:31:12] <sintax> I'll under cut for $1000
[18:31:23] <sintax> and put a down payment on a 3090ti...muah hahahahaha
[18:31:30] <Hunterkll> mistiry: and providing OS instances to people without macs, well now you have to get on their enterprise plans and shit 
[18:31:31] <Hunterkll> lol
[18:31:50] <Hunterkll> but yea we're gonna rack a few mac pro's with ESXi on them
[18:31:58] <Hunterkll> if you're on actual apple hardware, you don't need the "unlocker" hack
[18:31:59] <Hunterkll> it just works
[18:32:13] <Hunterkll> our POC is two mac minis running ESXi
[18:32:14] <Hunterkll> lol
[18:32:31] <mistiry> it doesnt violate their license?
[18:32:53] <Hunterkll> not if you're on apple's enterprise licensing and can actually procure the licenses through that
[18:32:54] <xe0n> too bad vmware is ditching apple lol
[18:33:01] <sintax> whomp whomp
[18:33:18] <mistiry> how do users access it?

[18:34:41] * sintax is woke!
[18:34:47] <mistiry> interesting. never seen anyone actually implement macs in that way. 
[18:34:58] <mistiry> like i said, last i knew, you couldnt legally virtualize it anyways
[18:35:02] <mistiry> had to hackintosh it
[18:35:05] <Hunterkll> oh you always c ould
[18:35:10] <Hunterkll> but only on apple-made hardware
[18:35:16] <xe0n> they updated their t&cs to clarify it awhile back
[18:35:25] <Hunterkll> iirc they added the bit about leasing
[18:35:31] <mistiry> so esxi runs bare metal on mac hardware?
[18:35:33] <Hunterkll> so that people like macstadium
[18:35:34] <Hunterkll> yes

[18:36:27] <Hunterkll> mistiry: xeon
[18:36:29] <mistiry> so does it virtualize the older macos version only?
[18:36:33] <Hunterkll> huh?
[18:36:37] <Hunterkll> latest macos is intel as well...
[18:36:38] <Hunterkll> and m1....
[18:36:44] <Hunterkll> they'll have both platform releases for a while
[18:37:08] <signofzeta> apple hasn't released an Apple Silicon-based Mac Pro yet.  That remains to be seen.  Will they look into fitting multiple M1 Max's, or wait for an M2?  who knows
[18:37:19] <xe0n> we're talking about vmware signofzeta
[18:37:20] <xe0n> lol
[18:37:22] <Hunterkll> but yea even 10.5 
[18:37:24] <Hunterkll> (iii) to install, use and run up to two (2) additional copies or instances of the Apple Software within 
[18:37:24] <Hunterkll> virtual operating system environments on each Mac Computer you own or control that is already 
[18:37:24] <Hunterkll> running the Apple Software
[18:37:29] * signofzeta scrolls up
[18:37:30] <Hunterkll> from like, 2008 
[18:37:33] <xe0n> :P
[18:37:36] <Hunterkll> had virtualization rights in the OS license
[18:38:09] <xe0n> Due to various challenges of COVID-19 and the recent announcement from Apple on their transition away from x86 to Apple Silicon, VMware will no longer pursue hardware certification for the Apple 2019 Mac Pro 7,1 for ESXi.
[18:38:19] <xe0n> ded
[18:38:26] <mistiry> but it says up to 2 _on each Mac you own or control that is already running Apple software_
[18:38:29] <Hunterkll> that..... doesn't say that at all but whatever
[18:38:36] <Hunterkll> mistiry: right, there's other programs and licensing scenarios apple has
[18:38:41] <Hunterkll> that superseed the base OS license
[18:38:51] <mistiry> >superseed
[18:38:53] <mistiry> SUPER SEED
[18:38:56] <Hunterkll> lol 
[18:39:17] <Hunterkll> downside is those programs kick in/only make sense at the 1000 mac or more level in the company
[18:39:31] <Hunterkll> because you have to buy support for 1000 macs minimum
[18:39:36] <mistiry> well, like i said, not a mac expert. if we had users that needed mac, they just got a mac and we were done with it.
[18:39:45] <xe0n> cheaper to just get em a mac mini
[18:39:46] <xe0n> lol
[18:39:48] <xe0n> faster too :P
[18:39:54] <Hunterkll> xe0n: we have more than 1000 macs lol
[18:39:58] <xe0n> okay?
[18:40:01] <Hunterkll> it's just a dragged out discussion because of business units, etc
[18:40:06] <Hunterkll> annoying af 
[18:40:15] <Hunterkll> we're trying to unify all our applecare sh it and get onsite service 
[18:40:16] <Hunterkll> lol
[18:40:23] <mistiry> do you AD join your macs?
[18:40:32] <Hunterkll> depends on scenario, but not as standard practice
[18:40:46] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> wtf I just made a truth table
[18:40:51] <Hunterkll> local account provisioned in a specific way via setup scripts/policies/routines when the user receives the machine shoved down to it via JAMF 
[18:40:55] <xe0n> truth or dare
[18:40:59] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> why am I doing excel work
[18:41:00] <Hunterkll> then the kerberos SSO extension is enabled and they sign into their AD account via that 
[18:41:09] <Hunterkll> so that provides all the network SSO crap etc

[18:41:12] <mistiry>  yeah we didnt have JAMF
[18:41:16] <Hunterkll> intune comes along for the ride for MS account SSO shit
[18:41:17] <mistiry> we only had at most like 30-40 macs
[18:41:30] <Hunterkll> and then they pair the smart card we've issued them to the local account via the same setup process
[18:41:33] <mistiry> mostly marketing and media folks. a couple of devs had them.
[18:41:42] <Hunterkll> so it's smartcard only login with valid kerberos session in the environment, but local account
[18:42:03] <Hunterkll> there's a few rough edges AD join ing would actually solve, but we didn't go a route that included an always on style VPN component to make it work the way i wanted to 
[18:42:12] <Hunterkll> would have had to deplyo cisco/anyconnect just for mac users, basically
[18:42:25] <Hunterkll> or palo alto 
[18:42:39] <mistiry> yeah we AD joined them and that was about it
[18:42:41] <Hunterkll> pulse kept dicking us around with all sorts of BS so 
[18:43:14] <Hunterkll> yea, mostly remote workforce and MFA enforced via smartcard (yubikey) logon makes it have a few other edge cases

[19:35:44] <fritzwastaken> Oh definitely
[19:35:50] <fritzwastaken> xe0n is too good for us
[19:35:54] <nobyk> So I've been using LXC containers now instead of KVMs. And other than technical limitations I don't see any reason not to use a container
[19:35:57] <nobyk> They're soo much lighter
[19:36:16] <nobyk> and the only technical limitation I've come across is wireguard and its kernel headers

[19:38:22] <nobyk> Well I think I have a feeling now.. :D
[19:38:28] <mistiry> instructions unclear, deleted entired script
[19:38:34] <nobyk> I have a lot of containers tho
[19:38:35] * sintax sprays cold water on nobyk
[19:38:50] <nobyk> not all of them a... ay
[19:38:50] <Hunterkll> nobyk: yea in the early 2000s zones were a tech that made people actually excited to chose solaris over linux :P
[19:38:51] <Hunterkll> lol
[19:38:55] <nobyk> what's that for
[19:39:05] <sintax> you caught a feeling
[19:39:23] <Hunterkll> but yea
[19:39:23] <nobyk> Think I'm high on believing now
[19:39:25] <nobyk> in the container
[19:39:33] <Hunterkll> this brief history is quite enlightening as to when things came around: https://blog.aquasec.com/a-brief-history-of-containers-from-1970s-chroot-to-docker-2016
[19:39:39] <nobyk> But like.. every app I want to run.. CONTAINER
[19:39:48] <nobyk> usually I'll see if it fits with the workload of an existing VM
[19:40:09] <nobyk> But it doens't really matter with lxcs
[19:40:11] <Hunterkll> ehhh gotta consider the app and flexibilty you need
[19:40:13] <Hunterkll> among other things
[19:40:26] <Hunterkll> like "do i need to be able to migrate this when i reboot the host, or no?"
[19:40:27] <nobyk> And I think that's the point, to 'containerize' everything
[19:40:40] <Hunterkll> lotta people run container hosts as VMs
[19:40:40] <Hunterkll> :P
[19:40:50] <nobyk> Have to put the disclaimer that this is my basement proxmox box and it's only one node
[19:41:12] <Hunterkll> i completely forgot about VServer
[19:41:31] <Hunterkll> solaris zones just blew away anything that had existed before in any rudimentary form 
[19:41:31] <Hunterkll> lol
[19:41:46] <Hunterkll> back then rootbsd.net was still a "VPS" provider giving you bsd jails

[20:17:14] <sd> 13<g​l0> 
[20:17:14] <sd> 13<g​l0> I've tried the following:
[20:17:14] <sd> 13<g​l0> 
[20:17:15] <sd> 13<g​l0> 1) Checked our fw logs for the MAC Address of machine for a possible IP, which I guess I was hoping I could use the leased IP as some additional info to further my search
[20:17:15] <sd> 13<g​l0> 2) Checked our AV endpoint, which actually helped with another lost machine in the past due to frequent scanning of C:\Users, which gave me a username. 
[20:17:22] <xe0n> holy multiline
[20:17:40] <Hunterkll> so group policy processing is done with the machine account context anyway
[20:17:44] <sd> 13<g​l0> I'm now making my way through our DCs... It's a real pain in the ass
[20:17:46] <Hunterkll> so won't tell you fuck all about a logged in user
[20:18:04] <Hunterkll> because it'll just be MACHINE$ accessed 50 files in \\domain.com\sysvol
[20:18:06] <sd> 13<g​l0> No, I know Hunter, but It's additional info I can possibly use
[20:18:08] <Hunterkll> when it's pulling GPO 
[20:18:14] <sd> 13<g​l0> I'm desperate
[20:18:22] <Hunterkll> but it won't help, and if you're not auditing each file access request over SMB, you have nothing to work with 
[20:18:52] <sd> 13<g​l0> Oh and SMB also
[20:18:58] <sd> 13<g​l0> 😆
[20:19:05] <xe0n> <auditing not enabled>
[20:19:13] <Hunterkll> unless you explicitly configured this absurd level of logging
[20:19:15] <Hunterkll> you don't have it
[20:19:46] <sd> 13<g​l0> So, anything else you can think of? or have I pretty much just wasted time?
[20:20:00] <Hunterkll> and even if you do, you probably never enlarged the default log size/set up rotation so you probably only have the psat like 3 hours of access anyway because of how much access there is
[20:20:30] <Hunterkll> pretty much 
[20:20:42] <Hunterkll> like, why would firewall logs show IP if the missing machine hasn't connected via VPN
[20:20:44] <Hunterkll> etc
[20:21:11] <sd> 13<g​l0> The machine has definitely connected to our firewalls, as the machine was deployed using our main method of deployment.
[20:21:28] <Hunterkll> okay..... but the mac address won't tell you fuck all unless the machine's actually on network somewhere
[20:21:52] <sd> 13<g​l0> I know, but as I said it was more of, find out the IP, look at the time of lease etc

[20:22:02] <xe0n> <1 year ago>

[20:22:08] <Hunterkll> for mac address
[20:22:14] <Hunterkll> then check DHCP logs on your DHCP server/service
[20:22:15] <Hunterkll> lol
[20:22:26] <Hunterkll> if..... they're set up to be retained in any such way.....

[20:28:01] <PublicWiFi> lol
[20:28:16] <PublicWiFi> I'm trying to learn a bit about our setup cause I looked like a jackass in a meeting yesterday
[20:28:31] <PublicWiFi> I should already know this but I never took teh time to document it all and figure it out xD
[20:28:32] <Hunterkll> so the usual daily 
[20:28:35] <PublicWiFi> ^
[20:28:49] <PublicWiFi> just wait till the next meeeting when I tell all the c-levels I want them to start using 2FA
[20:28:53] <PublicWiFi> ill be a huge jackass then
[20:29:37] <Hunterkll> ah yes the unemployment meeting
[20:29:49] <PublicWiFi> we have dedicated fiber. hits the building, fiber hits their hardware, fiber comes out and hits their cisco box of some kind
[20:29:55] <fritzwastaken> "THIS guy is our solo admin?"
[20:29:57] <PublicWiFi> we've got 2 active WAN ports used
[20:30:00] <fritzwastaken> *Collective facepalm*
[20:30:01] <PublicWiFi> fritzwastaken: ++
[20:30:11] <PublicWiFi> but my phone system setup is over my head...
[20:30:20] <PublicWiFi> phone system registered PRI lines
[20:30:24] <PublicWiFi> registers*
[20:30:43] <PublicWiFi> the cisco box has a "t1" output going god knows where, probably the phone system
[20:31:12] <PublicWiFi> so when they split a dedicated fiber to do a dedicated phone connection how does that shit work
[20:31:21] <PublicWiFi> why would the box have "t1" ports
[20:32:02] <Hunterkll> T1 is jsut a bunch of bundled 64k channels basically 
[20:32:13] <PublicWiFi> so is this cisco box emulating t1 or what
[20:32:19] <Hunterkll> it's likely
[20:32:28] <PublicWiFi> maybe my phone system can interface t1 natively? cause there's no t1 card
[20:32:31] <PublicWiFi> or anything inbetween
[20:32:44] <Hunterkll> i'd have to know wtf you're using
[20:32:49] <xe0n> LOL
[20:32:50] <PublicWiFi> avaya ip office xD
[20:32:55] <Hunterkll> for all i know that's an actual T1 coming in and cisco is converting it to voip 
[20:32:58] <PublicWiFi> I'm so lost in this it makes me sad tbh
[20:33:13] <PublicWiFi> it might be but the avaya system definitely don't think its using sip haha
[20:33:16] <Hunterkll> or it could even be leftover fuckin cables 
[20:33:29] <PublicWiFi> nah this has to be the "WAN" for the box
[20:33:34] <PublicWiFi> there's no other connections 
[20:33:47] <PublicWiFi> the other 2 WANs are accounted for and documented
[20:33:48] <fritzwastaken> its not the new phone companies job to clean up old phone systems most times. alot of relics are left beind in telecom closets
[20:34:05] <PublicWiFi> nah this t1 is coming out of our current at&t managed cisco  box
[20:34:11] <Hunterkll> well avaya ip office is pretty mdoernish 
[20:34:13] <PublicWiFi> and ia can see the dedicated fiber coming in
[20:34:17] <fritzwastaken> ill manage your box
[20:34:21] <PublicWiFi> ;D
[20:34:29] <xe0n> why not just ask your service provider? lol
[20:34:45] <PublicWiFi> i did but he's slow to get back
[20:34:47] <Hunterkll> or log into the avaya pbx and see wtf it says your uplink is
[20:34:49] <PublicWiFi> and its on my mind haha
[20:34:50] <mistiry> haha ipoffice
[20:34:53] <xe0n> AY YO HOW DOES OUR PBX WORK, WHAT ARE WE PAYING FOR
[20:35:04] <mistiry> fucking ip office was my nightmare for a few years
[20:35:05] <PublicWiFi> oh we just have a guy that fixes shit
[20:35:08] <PublicWiFi> he doesn't manage any of that crap
[20:35:14] <xe0n> he'd know then!
[20:35:15] <xe0n> LOL
[20:35:19] <fritzwastaken> lul
[20:35:24] <PublicWiFi> tbh when it comes to daily management i'm pretty good at ipoffice
[20:35:26] <fritzwastaken> he just comes in and moved wires around
[20:35:34] <fritzwastaken> no clue what hes doing or how its setup
[20:35:35] <xe0n> has a tone tester, makes the noises
[20:35:38] <xe0n> "yep you're good"
[20:35:38] <Hunterkll> so your avaya system probably has a T1 card
[20:35:41] <PublicWiFi> nah I didn't describe him good enough lol
[20:35:44] <PublicWiFi> he's a remote fella
[20:35:46] <Hunterkll> and AT&T is providing phone service to you over the fiber that's also doing internet
[20:35:52] <PublicWiFi> he just does admin tasks if I can't figure it out, which isn't much anymore
[20:35:56] <Hunterkll> and the AT&T managed box is breaking it out to a T1 run to your avaya box 
[20:36:02] <Hunterkll> so that AT&T doesnt have to run two cables
[20:36:03] <Hunterkll> lol
[20:36:05] <PublicWiFi> okay the avaya box has a "WAN" port that is def active
[20:36:13] <PublicWiFi> but when I tried to trace the cable it was a nightmare
[20:36:20] <PublicWiFi> its fuckin ziptied in a bundle so ill have to cut it lol
[20:36:24] <Hunterkll> log into the avaya a nd look.....
[20:36:35] <PublicWiFi> I'm showing PRI 24
[20:36:42] <Hunterkll> so yes, you hvae a T1 card in there
[20:36:52] <PublicWiFi> hmmm
[20:37:02] <Hunterkll> it should also tell you which slot its in 
[20:37:04] <PublicWiFi> well its not a "card"
[20:37:13] <PublicWiFi> card 1
[20:37:15] <PublicWiFi> ha
[20:37:17] <PublicWiFi> must be internal then
[20:37:20] <fritzwastaken> ...
[20:37:23] <PublicWiFi> you'd think the label wouldn't say "WAN"
[20:37:30] <PublicWiFi> cause if its a t1 card it wouldn't just accept ethernet lol
[20:37:32] <Hunterkll> https://www.metrolinedirect.com/ippri24t1exk.html
[20:37:34] <Hunterkll> it looks like that
[20:37:40] <fritzwastaken> PublicWiFi, im gunna need you go join discort for a little bit, you are in time out
[20:37:54] <PublicWiFi> nah the port on the box is definitely built in
[20:38:08] <PublicWiFi> lemme go double check before I look like an ever bigger dumbass
[20:38:08] <Hunterkll> ..... the card can be mounted internally....
[20:38:13] <Hunterkll> what model is the PBX .....
[20:38:23] <PublicWiFi> sec
[20:38:36] <Hunterkll> the management page should show you that
[20:38:37] <Hunterkll> lol
[20:39:17] <PublicWiFi> yeah thats what im looking at lol
[20:39:19] <PublicWiFi> 1 sec
[20:39:36] <Hunterkll> and the T1 card *wouldn't* be providing that management page
[20:39:41] <Hunterkll> that's probably what the "WAN" port is doing
[20:39:42] <Hunterkll> ;)
[20:40:18] <PublicWiFi> yeah probably
[20:40:26] <PublicWiFi> the "WAN" port has 0 config in that manager though
[20:40:28] <PublicWiFi> which is weird too
[20:40:38] <PublicWiFi> sec
[20:40:42] <Hunterkll> so it's like a vampire's anus
[20:40:46] <Hunterkll> present, but nonfunctional
[20:40:59] <PublicWiFi> lol
[20:41:14] <PublicWiFi> well the box just has a LAN and WAN port active, so the PRi HAS to be coming through the WAN
[20:41:26] <PublicWiFi> there's no other connections to this damn thing unless it plugs in the front cards somewhere lmfao
[20:42:13] <PublicWiFi> IP500 V2
[20:42:15] <PublicWiFi> is the system
[20:42:35] <PublicWiFi> okay it has a universal PRI card ofc, slot 1 so it must be internal
[20:42:42] <PublicWiFi> lemme go double check the ports one more time for fun
[20:42:55] <Hunterkll> its.... not
[20:42:56] <Hunterkll> lol
[20:43:25] <Hunterkll> daughter cards and slots ahoy
[20:43:28] <Hunterkll> that thing has 4 module bays
[20:43:32] <Hunterkll> on the front
[20:43:34] <Hunterkll> it appears
[20:44:32] <PublicWiFi> hmmm
[20:44:35] <PublicWiFi> yeah
[20:44:38] <Hunterkll> so one of the front modules
[20:44:40] <Hunterkll> has the daughter card
[20:44:42] <Hunterkll> slot 1
[20:44:43] <PublicWiFi> and one of the front modules has PRI ports
[20:44:49] <Hunterkll> where the T1 interface is connecting
[20:44:52] <PublicWiFi> with one port active, I think that's the t1
[20:44:55] <Hunterkll> the 'expansion' on the back is for expansion boxes
[20:44:59] <Hunterkll> that add more card slots
[20:45:06] <PublicWiFi> they have a unique cable color and its hte same on the cisco box. i think that's it

[20:45:09] <Hunterkll> lan/wan are for different hookup/interface scenarios
[20:45:10] <Hunterkll> lol
[20:45:18] <PublicWiFi> yeah the WAN is doing nothing I don't think
[20:45:31] <PublicWiFi> okay that helps, the PRI is using the T1 connection I suppose
[20:45:35] <Hunterkll> expansion you're probably not using if you've only got one T1 line, which is up to 24 digital voice PRIs
[20:45:45] <PublicWiFi> yup PRI 24
[20:45:48] <Hunterkll> since that box is overkill
[20:45:49] <PublicWiFi> is what we have configed
[20:45:53] <Hunterkll> with its 4 module slots
[20:46:03] <PublicWiFi> lol we also have an expansion xD
[20:46:11] <Hunterkll> how many fuckin phones you got
[20:46:24] <PublicWiFi> 50ish
[20:46:36] <Hunterkll> weird but okay
[20:46:45] <PublicWiFi> we're half a call center
[20:46:52] <PublicWiFi> half our business model is call center work
[20:47:01] <Hunterkll> sure but you have enough slots to do it without the expansion unit
[20:47:02] <Hunterkll> lol
[20:47:08] <PublicWiFi> nah they are full
[20:47:26] <PublicWiFi> a lot of the cards only do like 8 digital phones or something per card
[20:47:35] <PublicWiFi> and 4 ports of analog or other nonsense like PRI
[20:47:44] <Hunterkll> ah yea i see that for the DS card
[20:47:48] <PublicWiFi> yup
[20:47:54] <PublicWiFi> so teh expansion was needed for the rest

[20:48:38] <PublicWiFi> so now I feel better thanks :D

[20:50:17] <Hunterkll> and what you can actually order
[20:50:28] <Hunterkll> you can also get them to cut actual quotes/negotiate when you do a bit

[21:38:32] <dragonfleas> or compatibility with it i mean
[21:38:35] <Hunterkll> that'd be any X11 app....
[21:38:47] <Hunterkll> that's literally like 70% of the point of X11
[21:39:21] <arlion> easy mode
[21:39:24] <dragonfleas> gedit works but it's not an x11 app???
[21:39:31] <Hunterkll> gedit definitely is lol
[21:39:41] <Hunterkll> it pre-dates any implementations of other display systems
[21:39:43] <Hunterkll> by a long shot
[21:40:08] <Hunterkll> gedit initial release: Feburary 12, 1999 
[21:40:13] <dragonfleas> whew
[21:40:15] <dragonfleas> that's old as fuck
[21:41:01] <Hunterkll> why would you think it's not....
[21:41:19] <Hunterkll> or more to the point, why do you think X11 compatibility is a huge need for wayland
[21:41:19] <Hunterkll> lol
[21:41:31] <dragonfleas> i had a misunderstanding of what an x11 app is
[21:41:33] <Hunterkll> (and why wayland can't effectively replace X11 yet)
[21:41:56] <arlion> x11 is a display api used by linux since the 90s
[21:42:23] <Hunterkll> X11 predates linux
[21:42:49] <dragonfleas> x11 apparently is just the networking protocol
[21:42:59] <Hunterkll> yes and no.... it's a lot more than that
[21:43:05] <arlion> The X Window System (X11, or simply X) is a windowing system for bitmap displays, common on Unix-like operating systems. 
[21:43:06] <Hunterkll> I have a nice 10 book set on it if you'd like? 
[21:43:07] <Hunterkll> lol
[21:43:09] <arlion> X provides the basic framework for a GUI environment: drawing and moving windows on the display device and interacting with a mouse and keyboard. X does not mandate the user interface – this is handled by individual programs. As such, the visual styling of X-based environments varies greatly; different programs may present radically different interfaces. 
[21:43:16] <dragonfleas> yeah send that pdf my way pls
[21:43:17] <arlion> X originated as part of Project Athena at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 1984.[1] The X protocol has been at version 11 (hence "X11") since September 1987. The X.Org Foundation leads the X project, with the current reference implementation, X.Org Server, available as free and open-source software under the MIT License and similar permissive licenses. 
[21:43:24] <arlion> 1987 boi
[21:43:25] <Hunterkll> dragonfleas:  I have it in hardcopy
[21:43:26] <Hunterkll> lol
[21:43:27] <Hunterkll> yes
[21:43:29] <dragonfleas> LOL
[21:43:30] <dragonfleas> nerd
[21:43:36] <Hunterkll> rescued it from an office
[21:43:37] <Hunterkll> lol
[21:43:41] <Hunterkll> linux was "started" as a personal project in 1991
[21:44:03] <arlion> oh i wasn't disputing that part. I was curious when x11 originated. 
[21:44:22] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> o man I would sure love a good X11 arguement.
[21:44:34] <arlion> i knew x11 was old. but i didn't know it was older than i was.
[21:44:36] <Hunterkll> dragonfleas: but essentially, X11 running on your machine is a local "display server" and you co nnect over internal pipes/sockets/etc 
[21:44:51] <Hunterkll> so everything is basically talking to it over :0.0 normally
[21:45:31] <Hunterkll> but it progmatically supplies a fair bit more functionality, though a functional X display server can be had in 600kb of code
[21:45:37] <Hunterkll> and compared to the ones of yesteryear that's huge
[21:45:58] <Hunterkll> but that's with full color(like 65k or 16-bit), touch screen support, decent resolutions, etc
[21:46:17] <dragonfleas> interesting
[21:46:50] <Hunterkll> but there's more to it than just the protocol and supporting your display hardware and i/o hardware, obvoiusly
[21:47:23] <Hunterkll> things like the structures/basic GUI widget functionality/etc

[22:03:29] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> I much rather prefer cube city over offices but only if I get to sit with my team.
[22:03:33] <Hunterkll> so you have to set http, .html, etc instead of just setting "browser"
[22:03:49] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> But it also depends on what you do I suppose.

[22:23:14] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> I think you don't understand how xml namespace works
[22:23:22] <sd> 11<H​otmess> xml is xlink:type
[22:23:26] <sd> 11<H​otmess> html is href
[22:23:26] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> and what XSL is
[22:23:44] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> it's literally the styling language for XML
[22:23:48] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> kind of like CSS is for HTML
[22:24:01] <sd> 11<H​otmess> xlink:href="/images/XQuery.gif" would be the formal xml
[22:24:02] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> except it's more akin to PDF formatting in many ways
[22:24:10] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> ......
[22:24:12] <sd> 11<H​otmess> probably why firefox isnt rendering it
[22:24:30] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> not true
[22:24:44] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> and it's because of security settings in a specific mode
[22:24:49] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> firefox is treating the XSL as remote when it's not
[22:24:52] <sd> 11<H​otmess> <a href="https://www.w3schools.com">Visit W3Schools</a>
[22:24:53] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> because of how it's referenced
[22:25:07] <sd> 11<H​otmess> is the html variant of href
[22:25:24] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> okay well
[22:25:27] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> according to the documetnation
[22:25:32] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> when you specify a style sheet in XML
[22:25:35] <sd> 11<H​otmess> <reference href="https://cyber.mil/%22%3E is whats in=your docment
[22:25:40] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> href is a valid way to do that
[22:25:49] <sd> 11<H​otmess> if it was <reference xlink:href="https://cyber.mil/%22%3E
[22:25:54] <sd> 11<H​otmess> i would probably render

[22:27:01] <sd> 11<H​otmess> is what i am going on
[22:27:13] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> but we're not creating any hyperlinks
[22:27:13] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> at all
[22:27:37] <sd> 11<H​otmess> that also is for imaging ebedding whenyou have a external refence
[22:28:12] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> except that doesn't work for the manner of display that is preferred here (both application and browser based) and XSL is the chosen, by-XML spec defined, way that works
[22:29:24] <sd> 11<H​otmess> whats the link for the actual page?

[22:30:52] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> XCCDF files are XML files that are used by a variety of software, but can also produce nice reference/documentation style materials when combined with proper styling - aka XML's XSL/XSLT functionality - in a browser for manual viewing as well

[22:32:34] <estranger> god i love krisp.ai
[22:32:37] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> so yes, it is all perfectly valid legal XML
[22:33:07] <sd> 11<H​otmess> your better off doing html imo
[22:33:28] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> except then the file can't be easily ingested by said tools that will use the xccdf file for other purposes
[22:33:40] <sd> 11<H​otmess> <xsd:attribute name="href" type="xsd:anyURI" use="required"/>
[22:33:40] <sd> 11<H​otmess> as it seems that schema is defining the href for your file anyway
[22:33:42] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> the XSL is a tiny ass file that makes the XML data easily presentable and only shows what's needed for a readable reference manual

[22:34:19] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> using HTML would defeat the purpose, except adding extra generation steps for the people producing the XCCDF for no reason at all
[22:34:21] <sd> 11<H​otmess> is where i am getting that from
[22:34:42] <sd> 11<H​otmess> html styling is supeior for ease of reading
[22:34:51] <sd> 11<H​otmess> unless your gonna use a screen reader format
[22:34:54] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> except..... this works just as well.....
[22:34:59] <sd> 11<H​otmess> which hoenslty i dont know much about
[22:35:04] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> there's no point in doing the extra effort for zero return
[22:35:18] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> since it needs to be in XCCDF (XML) format *anyway*
[22:35:24] <sd> 11<H​otmess> i mean type it up in word and then just save as html
[22:35:25] <sd> 11<H​otmess> and your done
[22:35:43] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> ..... but again, these are organized publications meant for consumption in various types of applications
[22:35:46] <sd> 11<H​otmess> thats a bare minumum of effort ono the document creatotr
[22:35:49] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> with the convinence of also easily displaying in the browser
[22:35:57] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> these documents are also not created in things like word
[22:35:59] <PublicWiFi> all you can eat pizza buffet for lunch

[22:36:05] <sd> 11<H​otmess> nice public
[22:36:06] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> that deal in these file itypes
[22:36:10] <PublicWiFi> i got the pizza sweats boys
[22:36:19] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> you're going to have to create the xccdf anyway
[22:36:19] <sd> 11<H​otmess> you can still ingest html into anything that can read xml
[22:36:28] <sd> 11<H​otmess> and its a hell of alot easier too
[22:36:31] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> LOL
[22:37:06] <sd> 11<H​otmess> given i can parse the html using whatever language i want using established libaries
[22:37:10] <sd> 11<H​otmess> rather than mess around with xpath
[22:37:13] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> html is generally a fucking nightmare to process because it's so loose
[22:37:14] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> same with XML.....
[22:37:18] <sd> 11<H​otmess> as much as i like xpath

[22:37:43] <sd> 11<H​otmess> word doc is xml thankfully
[22:38:08] <sd> 11<H​otmess> but thats more for achive format status
[22:39:38] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> that and xpath's a syntax, not a library.....
[22:40:40] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> there's such a huge fucking menagerie of XML parsing/processing libraries and systems it's absurd really
[22:40:45] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> in every damn langauge
[22:41:29] <rpifan> yes
[22:42:14] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> anyway, XCCDF is the format the industry uses/is standardized, and to make it easily displayable takes a 13KB CSS-like style sheet that's defined in XML spec, which is standardized and is the same XSL for every XCCDF that at least NIST puts out so there's zero extra work to make it displayable/printable
[22:43:31] <PublicWiFi> what about the kxcd format 
[22:44:09] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> no not docx... I mean the .doc format
[22:44:21] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> which is not XML
[22:44:21] <sd> 11<H​otmess> fair enough
[22:44:33] <sd> 11<H​otmess> there are no other word formats than docx for me 😉
[22:45:18] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> @Hotness and a lot of the stuff in there, like the <xccdf:reference > fields are providing (for teh application that parses the file) references that it can point/pull in for the end user that aren't normally required when reviewing it as a normal documentation for implementation/validation too
