[11:32:14] <acagastya> Hi, I have a large image (both width and heigh extends beyond the window dimension).  I want to display it within the window without needing to scroll either way, and have 5em space around it.  How do I do it?
[11:35:01] <Joc> img {
[11:35:01] <Joc>   width: 100%;
[11:35:01] <Joc>   height: auto;
[11:35:01] <Joc> }
[11:36:07] <acagastya> I did that, Joc, but that makes me scroll in Y.
[11:36:59] <Joc> does inverting the 100% and auto helps?
[11:37:44] <Joc> or maybe both auto
[11:38:23] <acagastya>  does inverting the 100% and auto helps? // Introduces scroll in both direction.
[11:38:44] <acagastya> Same with both auto.
[11:40:13] <acagastya> Should I wrap the `<img>` in div and make it auto/auto?
[11:40:55] <Joc> what about max-height: ??px;
[11:42:50] <acagastya> You mean, literally typing `??px`?  Or something like `max:height: 100vh`?
[11:43:37] <Joc> ?? is the maximum height, assuming you know it
[11:46:00] <acagastya> I could of course check, but Is there a way without knowing?  (I tried `max-width: 100vw; max-height: 100vh; width: auto; height: auto;` which seems to work, but then, for the white space, I might have to do something like `max-width: calc(100vh - 10em);`.
[11:49:29] <Joc> for the 5em, I think setting a padding for the container should do the trick, for example if the image is into a div:  div {   padding: 5px}
[11:52:26] <Joc> I¬¥m not sure about the height. do you have a URL, maybe that will help to understand better
[11:58:26] <acagastya> https://0x0.st/-fFR.html (might have to do view page source) seems to work.
[11:58:30] <acagastya> Thanks, @Joc!
[11:58:39] <Joc> I¬¥ve never seen the unit ¬®vw¬® and ¬®vh¬® before, interesting.
[12:01:17] <acagastya> viewport width, viewport height.
[12:05:14] <Joc> you should be able to set the padding 5em of the viewport, that should give the spacing around the image I believe
[12:07:38] <Joc> your url give a blank page. best to use an online editor
[12:07:44] <acagastya> Yes, that code worked, Joc.  Thanks for that!  Though I don't know why auto auto didn't work -- it works for centering, though.
[12:08:14] <Joc> good!
[12:08:19] <acagastya> I was showing the CSS rules -- the image, well, grabbing any large image should do.

[16:32:59] <acagastya> Well, something like this.  https://jsfiddle.net/umag978p/1/
[16:33:14] <acagastya> Though I don't know why text isn't aligning to the right.
[16:33:46] <entuland> for one, you screwed the class name
[16:39:24] <entuland> acagastya, once you've fixed the class name see if it's doing what you want (cause fixing it myself I _do_ see an overflow, though not sure whether that's what you want)
[16:41:52] <acagastya> I do not want the over flow to be visible.
[16:42:53] <entuland> cutting text on the right while aligning from the left is trivial (you just have to constrain the element width pretty much)
[16:43:09] <entuland> cutting the text on the right while aligning on the right may require an additional wrapper
[16:45:19] <acagastya> https://ibb.co/frL74QH
[16:45:29] <acagastya> For text foobar -- something like that.
[16:45:31] <entuland> yes, I understand what you want
[16:45:51] <entuland> as I mentioned, your case with text aligned to the right and you want the text to cut on the right requires a wrapper likely
[16:46:08] <entuland> because the browser has to know where the element's right edge is, to align the text to it
[16:46:12] <acagastya> I don't mind adding more divs, if needed, but I can't quite imagine which set of rules might be useful.
[16:46:42] <entuland> parent set to 100px, children set to 150px with text "foobar" aligned to the right, parent set to overflow: hidden;
[16:47:10] <entuland> made up numbers of course
[16:47:22] <acagastya> Well, I don't know what the width of the div is going to be.
[16:47:45] <entuland> that's just an example
[16:47:55] <hassoon> you don't need to specify the numbers
[16:47:59] <entuland> yep
[16:48:17] <hassoon> just specify a width for the parent (aka wrapper) entuland told you about
[16:48:20] <entuland> what matters is that you can't have the flex affect the part you want cut directly
[16:48:38] <entuland> so you have flex affect the parent, restraining its width
[16:48:43] <hassoon> and the child's text will get cut as long aas the wrapper's css overflow rule is set to hidden

[16:56:34] <entuland> acagastya, how is the browser supposed to know how much white space to leave on the left hand side?
[16:56:54] <entuland> in order to do that, the element containing the text must be _larger_ than the text itself

[16:59:52] <acagastya> Browser support: ignore ie, Firefox is okay.
[17:00:15] <entuland> we didn't talk about browser support
[17:00:28] <entuland> the above is the closest I can get to this sample of yours: https://ibb.co/frL74QH
[17:00:30] <acagastya> Oh, "supposed" -- not support.
[17:00:35] <entuland> yep :P
[17:00:56] <acagastya> This fiddle seems to be good: https://ghanhass.github.io/myfiddle/324 -- (you have your own fiddle, that is so cool!) let me try putting all the things together, to see if it worked.
[17:00:56] <entuland> in my example you can see I can achieve that whitespace at the beginning, but only because I'm forcing the width of the children to be 300px
[17:01:44] <hassoon> acagastya: the text is aligned to the right, and it's cut somwhere in the middle, what else do you need to achieve ?
[17:01:57] <entuland> not sure if it's working as intended for me: https://i.imgur.com/wSw9MQw.png
[17:02:36] <hassoon> entuland: :o
[17:02:39] <entuland> as I don't see the whitespace on the left as per the above requirement - maybe the whitespace isn't a requirement?
[17:03:00] <hassoon> chrome in ignito mode ?
[17:03:09] <acagastya> hassoon -- that div is a part of -- well -- other things will become its neighbours, so now that it works, I want to see if it works as expected when everything is put together.
[17:03:38] <hassoon> acagastya: well put everything in a fiddle and show us ?
[17:04:12] <entuland> hassoon, no, I can see the technique working, it's the same that I did, the point is the lack of this whitespace which I thought was a requirement: https://i.imgur.com/IrFiDtL.png
[17:04:42] <acagastya> No, that was not a requirement.
[17:04:52] <entuland> okay
[17:05:00] <acagastya> Drawing on trackpad is hard.  So that space.
[17:05:06] <entuland> not sure why you need the text aligned to the right then
[17:05:37] <hassoon> entuland: if i don't set whitespace the text will be broken to new line
[17:05:51] <hassoon> ah unless i set a height for the .t as well
[17:05:58] <entuland> hassoon, I'm not talking about the whitespace property
[17:05:59] <hassoon> acagastya: is whitespace a problem ?
[17:06:03] <hassoon> entuland: then what
[17:06:10] <entuland> I'm talking about the actual empty space that I pointed with red arrows
[17:06:43] <hassoon> entuland: well they wanted the text to be right-aligned, so we will surely have a huge white space in the left side ? won't we ?
[17:07:46] <entuland> the point is that I don't think they need it right-aligned at all, but probably it's just something lost in the definition of the requirements
[17:07:55] <acagastya> hassoon -- no -- there should be no whitespace -- you see, that image was supposed to show how "foobar" was being cut somewhere in between.  The whitespace is just because it is hard to draw.
[17:08:18] <acagastya> I want the text to "flow" out from the right boundary.
[17:08:20] <entuland> acagastya, then you likely don't need the text-align: right at all
[17:08:39] <entuland> the overflow to the right is normal behavior even if the text is aligned to the left
[17:08:54] <hassoon> acagastya: i think you need the element to be absolute-positioned
[17:09:40] <hassoon> acagastya: with right:0;transform:translateX(100%); you'll have your text just out of the div, visually
[17:13:40] <acagastya> Yes, that works, hassoon!
[17:13:53] <acagastya> Just needs a z-index from the neighbour, but it works!
[17:15:18] <hassoon> acagastya: look here https://ghanhass.github.io/myfiddle/325
[17:16:14] <acagastya> I just tweaked 100% to ~20 and that works like a charm, with everything that is to come!
[17:16:18] <acagastya> Thanks a lot for that!
[17:16:55] <hassoon> so that's how you need to show up a part of the text ? rather than using an arbitrary width ?

[17:21:19] <hassoon> alright then
[17:23:15] <entuland> out of curiosity, what's the purpose of this cut?

[17:24:57] <acagastya> To have something like this -- just checking if the √¶thetic looks nice, or not.
[17:26:10] <entuland> is the red line I am adding here going to match with the beginning of the space allocated for "flower"? https://i.imgur.com/iqsQ7Es.png
[17:27:15] <entuland> if so, you don't need any fancy rules or transforms or wrappers or anything
[17:28:15] <entuland> you just need to keep the text left-aligned, maybe just the nowrap whitespace declaration, and let the hidden overflow do its default behavior of cutting on the right

[17:38:29] <entuland> see what does the job with the minimal amount of markup and css, can't estimate precisely myself because of not knowing the surroundings
[17:39:14] <entuland> also, I assume you said "floating" just to describe the behavior and that you're not actually using the float technique - which you shouldn't be using unless you want to have large paragraphs of text wrap around the floated elements

[23:47:51] <entuland> don't think it makes any difference whether the property is set explicitly or not - if you set a span to display: inherit on a plain div with no other CSS affecting the div, the span will be set to be displayed as a block
[23:51:32] <birkoff> well browser dev tools says it is display although it should suppose to inherit something else
[23:51:39] <birkoff> s/display/block
[23:51:47] <birkoff> but setting it to inherit does it
[23:51:59] <hassoon> entuland: meh the div's display property is set by the UA, same story
[23:52:08] <hassoon> which is block
[23:54:03] <birkoff> is there something like justify-content: option that would put the items in a row from start with spacing only after each item, so for examplme two items would be:  [ITEM][ SPACING TO 50%][ITEM][SPACING TO 50%]
[23:55:13] <entuland> is there any element without a display property? I assumed you meant "set display property" as "explicitly set in CSS" or something
[23:56:02] <entuland> birkoff, the computed display property will evaluate to something no matter what, I don't understand what's not working as intended there
[23:56:21] <hassoon> entuland: i meant you inspect the div in the devtools, and see if there is any value set for the display property for the said element, whether that's user-defined or UA-defined
[23:56:21] <birkoff> entuland: I did
[23:57:01] <entuland> I'm still confused by that closest ancestor reference - the property will be inherited from the parent
[23:57:21] <entuland> could you show me a case where the property is not inherited from the parent?
[23:57:25] <birkoff> <div1> <- set in css to display: flex>   <subdiv> <- not set in css to anything. browser shows it is display:block
[23:58:05] <entuland> the elements inside a flex context will be forced to have display: block or flex wouldn't be able to arrange them
[23:58:30] <entuland> in this case it's not inheritance, it's the normal behavior of flex
[23:58:40] <birkoff> shown like: ..., div, ... { display: block; }  (user agent) inline: 104
[23:59:08] <entuland> birkoff, could you screenshot that? I'm still not sure I understand where the problem is
[23:59:24] <birkoff> if so then there is no problem
[23:59:55] <birkoff> though I can still set that nested div to a flex itself too and there would be no problem
[23:59:58] <entuland> also, if by subdiv you mean an actual <DIV>, display: block; is their default display even outside of a flex context
