[12:44:46] <dege> I've worked for 1.5 years at VMware now and yesterday I received the first item of swag .. a t-shirt promoting a conference I'm not attending .. and now I realize I should've posted an unboxing video .. fails all around
[12:46:44] <GodEater> I have many t-shirts for conferences I've never attended.
[12:47:14] <GodEater> my wife has great fun in pointing out my entire wardrobe is either stuff I got for free, or very expensive. There doesn't appear to be a middle ground
[12:51:04] <Piru> genuinely the best company swag I've received, ever: https://sintonen.fi/cloud/index.php/s/3HedNAFo7MARqX9 -- good backpack is priceless, and this one is bloody good

[12:51:50] <Piru> should find out who actually makes those and get some spares while I can :P
[12:52:27] <cart_man> Does the curl lib need compiling before you can use it?  Is there a way to use the source without compiling first?
[12:52:37] <dege> no
[12:52:40] <testuser[m]> how is that supposed to work
[12:53:13] <dege> libcurl isn't written in an interpreted language, it must be compiled
[12:57:48] *** Quits: conicalformation (~conicalfo@172-125-77-83.lightspeed.sntcca.sbcglobal.net) (Quit: This computer has gone to sleep)
[13:00:15] <cart_man> surely you can include the source to your code. If you really wanted to
[13:02:24] <dege> you mean to include an amalgamation of the libcurl code directly into your own C code and compile it all as one codebase?
[13:02:43] <dege> that sounds like a case of "when it breaks you get to keep both pieces"
[13:03:04] <dege> curl 7.79 mentioned in Bulletproof TLS Newsletter 81
[13:04:48] <bagder> hehe, yeah Hanno asked me about the relation between those CVEs and his work on the STARTTLS paper
[13:09:18] <GodEater> is compiling a binary for a system with an older version of libc something I going to regret even thinking about?
[13:09:46] <Piru> compile a static binary and you'll be fine
[13:10:08] <GodEater> oh true
[13:10:53] <Piru> else you'll need to have some environment where you can build against the target system or you'll face trouble and regret
[13:12:13] <Piru> static linking is rather rare these days though, and unfortuantely many things will need major coaxing to get working. just recently I tried to produce a static GDB. It'd just segfault every time. That was not good for my blood pressure
[13:16:08] <testuser[m]> static gdb on glibc ?
[13:16:31] <GodEater> I'm trying to get a copy of fallocate which will run on an older distro that I don't have it packaged for
[13:17:21] <testuser[m]> GodEater:  busybox has it
[13:18:15] <GodEater> I'm not sure how that helps me
[13:26:23] <testuser[m]> Busy box is easy to get static on glibc
[13:29:42] <cart_man> dege: lol
[14:11:10] <Piru> GodEater: it's a kernel syscall. you don't need any glibc in between, but you WILL need a kernel that has it. else you're out of luck regardless of glibc
[14:12:05] <GodEater> I made do with waiting for dd to write a really big file instead ;)
[14:12:27] <GodEater> problem we experienced in production a couple of weeks ago now successfully replicated, no more need to mess around with it
[14:12:38] <Piru> heh ok
[14:13:02] <Piru> anyway, bypassing libc and calling kernel is cool :)
[14:13:32] <GodEater> I'll try and remember that for next time
[14:14:12] <Piru> for example MIPS https://sintonen.fi/src/nanonc/syscallhack.h
[14:14:59] <Piru> libc is for posers ;)

[18:01:52] <Piru> wow. LE has been issuing certs with expiring intermediate cert
[18:01:55] <Piru> I got one
[18:02:10] <Piru> https://sintonen.fi/cloud/index.php/s/MFXgGj76559W3ib/preview
[18:02:27] <Piru> what a fumble
[18:02:37] <bagder> https://twitter.com/Scott_Helme/status/1443293844292919304
[18:02:59] <bagder> its been known for quite some time
[18:03:32] <Piru> that LE is buggy?
[18:03:56] <bagder> no, they changed intermediate
[18:04:05] <bagder> so a client should find another cert chain path
[18:04:10] <bagder> that isn't expired
[18:04:29] <bagder> I believe
[18:04:56] <Piru> well. LE issued fullchain has the expired cert in it
[18:05:01] <Piru> so this is a LE issue
[18:05:51] <Piru> hmmm wait a moment..
[18:06:37] <Piru> hmm weird.
[18:06:46] <Piru> let me check again
[18:09:46] <Piru> hmm. wtf now. the p12 does have the new cert in it..
[18:10:15] <Piru> but browser and curl see the old one. I'm puzzled
[18:13:37] <Piru> ok it's seems jellyfin is at blame. it doesn't server the intermediate cert and thus old one is picked from elsewhere
[18:13:42] <Piru> serve*
[18:14:05] <Piru> I guess I really need to puit some real proxy in between in the end
[18:14:09] <Piru> put*
[18:26:31] <lazyreader> https://twitter.com/saleemrash1d/status/1443568671465504780
[18:27:04] <lazyreader> openssl 1.0.x apparently have some troubles building the correct chain
[18:27:21] <lazyreader> _but_ older android devices don't have the newer root
[18:27:27] <lazyreader> so it's a mess either way

[22:04:08] <Naglfar> maybe it's time to update libressl-3.0.2
[22:08:05] <Piru> well I meant to check the site in question with https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/ -- not run curl on it
[22:08:15] <Piru> but it seems to be a local client side issue
[22:11:03] <Piru> Naglfar: you could try grabbing https://curl.se/ca/cacert.pem and then try curl --cacert cacert.pem ...
[22:20:03] <Naglfar> Piru, this works http://vpaste.net/9u3SA
[22:20:28] <Piru> what works?
[22:21:01] <Naglfar> this:
[22:21:15] <Naglfar> curl --cacert cacert.pem https://curl.se
[22:21:30] <Piru> and does it fail without the --cacert ?
[22:21:38] <Naglfar> exactly
[22:21:58] <Piru> ok, then you have either outdated or broken files in /etc/ssl/certs/
[22:22:40] <Naglfar> nice, I'll try to fix it
[22:22:44] <Naglfar> thank you for help

[22:44:23] <fedorafansuper> hello guys i cot that curl: (60) SSL certificate problem: certificate has expired
[22:44:23] <fedorafansuper> More details here: https://curl.haxx.se/docs/sslcerts.html
[22:45:15] <ajak> works for me
[22:45:31] <ajak> maybe something wrong with your device?
[22:45:40] <fedorafansuper> nothing is wrong with that
[22:45:45] <moparisthebest> apparently all letsencrypt sites have to choose between 1. breaking old android 2. breaking everything using openssl 1.0.x
[22:46:03] <ajak> no, it's not letsencrypt sites
[22:46:15] <moparisthebest> starting a couple hours ago that is, so this channel will probably see a lot of these, at least from sites that chose #2
[22:46:17] <ajak> they don't control what signs the certs they ask to be signed
[22:46:17] -curelbot- [GitHub] PR #2: Storing the URL alongside the downloaded file (https://github.com/curl/curl/pull/2)
[22:46:37] <fedorafansuper> ok
[22:46:57] <ajak> (is curelbot drunk?)
[22:47:25] <fedorafansuper> ajak do you have homebrew?
[22:47:36] <ajak> no, but this isn't a place for homebrew support
[22:47:38] <moparisthebest> ajak, ah, I guess because I said # 2 without the space :P
[22:47:57] <ajak> oh lol, i see
[22:48:10] <fedorafansuper> forget it
[22:48:15] <fedorafansuper> ignored
[22:48:16] <fedorafansuper> wow
