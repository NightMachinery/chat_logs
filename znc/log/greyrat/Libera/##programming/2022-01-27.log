[01:28:59] <KillerWasp> I thought it was a great idea to produce an ordering method with a chain of pointers...

[01:32:41] <bjs> sonny: think about something like Python or Java,  you can create objects and pass them around and store references to them everywhere.  But once you stop using the object you need to detect that.  This is what a "garbage collector" does.

[01:38:14] <sonny> bjs: yeah, so just say all references will be released on X condition
[01:38:30] <bjs> sonny: what is the condition? you can't just force everyone to give up a reference in the middle of your program :P
[01:38:32] <PlanckWalk> sonny: What sort of conditions?
[01:38:45] <sonny> bjs: that's actually what I was thinking
[01:38:51] <epony> you have thrashing on your SSD memory management too, deallocation and reallocation of faulty cells is using cells to store that data

[01:40:11] <sonny> PlanckWalk: I don't have concrete ideas at the moment, but I will think of some
[01:40:30] <epony> filling all your RAM, SSD and HDD space is not a nice thing to do

[01:40:33] <bjs> sonny: and nobody does it this way because it's kind of crazy, like I say it's really much more about tracking the state of the system and not "scheduling" things in time at all
[01:40:49] <sonny> PlanckWalk: yeah, but they seem not to be deterministic
[01:40:52] <PlanckWalk> Such as "this object is unreachable through any references held by the program"
[01:40:54] <epony> garbage collection is like the TLB, it gets stuffed eventually
[01:41:13] <sonny> bjs: yeah it is pretty crazy

[01:42:24] <epony> checking is an option, but it's not what determinism is about
[01:42:34] <PlanckWalk> Since reassigning happens about every second line of code, that would be inefficient.
[01:42:41] <epony> it's about knowing you could check and have the expected result
[01:42:46] <bjs> sonny: a common way to do this is with reference counting, so each object knows how many other objects reference it.  Once no other objects reference it then it can be deleted.  This is deterministic (unless you mean something else), but has nothing to do with "time".
[01:42:47] <PlanckWalk> Yes
[01:42:56] <sonny> epony: thrashing means the addresses are incorrect?
[01:43:13] <epony> it means overloading and not enough capacity to store or process
[01:43:14] <bjs> sonny: note that refcounting has a problem in that if you have cycles of references (A has a reference to B, B has one to C, and C has one to A) then you need something fancier to detect these
[01:43:32] <epony> so is resultant in loss of memory references and disk space and processes etc

[01:43:55] <bjs> sonny: MMUs and TLBs are not very related to memory management in the sense we are describing it here. epony is doing their usual thing of wikipediaing and following keywords and somehow got lost along the way
[01:44:08] <sonny> it makes sense tbh
[01:44:32] * epony is never lost, you will find out ;-)
[01:44:35] <PlanckWalk> At least heap thrashing was relevant
[01:44:44] <PlanckWalk> The rest, yeah, not so much.
[01:45:02] <sonny> well it started since I asked if there was hardware to track addresses
[01:45:13] <bjs> sonny: a more advanced kind of automatic memory management system is a garbage collector,  see things like mark&sweep (tracing garbage collectors).  
[01:45:35] <bjs> sonny: well tracking the addresses isn't the hard part, it's tracking the links between objects.
[01:45:36] <epony> "deters minimism" is the originial joke
[01:45:59] *** BoostedStella is now known as stella
[01:46:11] <sonny> bjs: hmm
[01:46:50] <epony> computers can track beans very well, even if you spill them all the time, you just have to have enough counters
[01:47:12] <sonny> maybe if all objects lived in this special grid where binary or matrix ops could detect links
[01:47:34] <bjs> sonny: because there's a dependency right? if object A refers to object B, you can't free A before you free B. and you cannot free B if A is still being used.  So if you were to do something in hardware to help automatic memory management for languages like Java or whatever, you'd need something that knew about these links/depedencies and walk memory
[01:48:06] <bjs> which is basically what the software is doing already.

[01:50:05] <upp> hmm any lunix image viewers supporting avif yet
[01:50:06] <bjs> ski: oops you are right, I'm not sure what I was trying to say there.  if A stores a reference to B then you can of course free A, it doesn't affect B.

[02:02:54] <jeaye> ProfSimm: It would help for you to understand what you mean by "CLI". bjs and I both assumed you meant a unixy shell, such as bash.
[02:02:55] <bjs> sonny: take a read on garbage collection and refcounting and things. This is how languages like Java and Python know "when" to free some memory: by keeping track of what's happening in the program as it runs, so it can detect 'when' it's safe to remove it.
[02:03:05] <ProfSimm> jeaye: yes correct
[02:03:15] <epony> Pascal was first
[02:03:31] <jeaye> ProfSimm: If you're talking about bash, though, you should say bash so things are clear. CLI doesn't imply any specific tech. Could be cmd.exe on Windows.

[03:05:45] <papercut> i get it, i usually just like solving the problems, i never win lol
[03:05:47] <bjs> sonny: same with the regex.  It's the automata that has transitions, and the null transition (or tau transition or whatever you call it) is a transition which consumes an empty string (i.e. it does not consume any of the input). So there's a clear correspondence
[03:05:53] <bjs> sonny: no the grammar is not a machine,  the machine is a machine

[03:30:02] <bjs> sonny: but this is kind of backwards to how you normally think about things. You don't start with a non-terminal and start expanding randomly you start with a string and start consuming the input
[03:30:22] <sonny> so it's just an arbitrary choice like using eof to tell me to terminate?
[03:30:25] <bjs> sonny: this is how the actual machine works, right? you start at some initial state and slowly consume characters at a time
[03:30:49] <sonny> bjs: why not? I thought grammars are about rewriting

[03:31:34] <sonny> bjs: thanks, I think I sorta get it

[03:37:28] <sonny> yes that's true, the comment is to imply N takes $
[03:37:33] <bjs> but it accepts 103, because you can expand N => DN => DDN => DDDN => DDDempty => ... => 10Dempty => 103empty which is equal to the input string.
[03:37:57] <bjs> sonny: what do you mean?
[03:38:17] <sonny> $ is a termination marker, that's how I will decide to stop
[03:38:33] <sonny> I don't recall these being put in grammars though
[03:38:56] <bjs> sonny: is $ just the regex .*  (i.e. consume all remaining input)

[03:39:20] <sonny> no, it's not a regex, it's just a symbol
[03:40:20] <jensen> an old abandoned project failed to build with its provided build process. someone provided a a quick and dirty patch that got the build to work but there are still warnings about deprecated functions and what not. will the built executable be improved if all the warnings were resolved or is the fact that it's built successfully means it works as advertised despite all the warnings? obviously
[03:40:23] <jensen> it would be better if the build instructions were more up to date, but i was curious if the executable can/might be of lower quality because of poor build instructions

[03:43:39] <bjs> sonny: well you can write a rule `WILDCARD` that matches any terminal, it's just laborious
[03:44:39] <sonny> haskell doesn't use a termination symbol in their syntax. the describe numbers as decimal -> digit{digit} 
[03:44:40] <bjs> but yeah, syntax more designed to actually be used will have something like this builtin
[03:44:56] <epony> ski, more like, Lisp sticks to everything and has no reliability and performance

[03:45:38] <sonny> epony: performance is overrated ;)
[03:45:41] <bjs> sonny: lots of fancy grammars have * built-in so you don't have to do this encoding yourself
[03:46:17] <sonny> I'm taking about a termination character not just *
[03:46:35] <bjs> sonny: digit{digit} is digit digit*  in the Haskell syntax

[03:47:00] <bjs> sonny: it doesn't explicitly write it out in the way we did here because the grammar being defined there is using a shorthand to be practical
[03:47:07] <epony> the Lisp people claim it's the "hardware that betrayed them" and claim "hardware is optimised for algols" while it's their own choice of an inefficient data structure that fails them (and decisions to not use the computer model, but an abstract machine)
[03:47:15] <sonny> yes, they don't account for termination
[03:47:20] <bjs> sonny: what do you mean?
[03:47:27] <bjs> it's exactly the same as going `decimal = digit decimal | empty`
[03:47:40] <epony> which is fine, just their claims on "computation" are indecisive (non-computable)
[03:47:40] <sonny> yeah, so there is still the problem of when to stop
[03:47:41] <bjs> uh except I'm missing a digit :P
[03:48:03] <bjs> sonny: well not really, because your strings are finite. If you see 5 digits you don't expand it 6 times..
[03:48:21] <epony> so, they choose to do the same thing anew, with a different data structure, proving that they can do programming, but can't pick data structures
[03:48:33] <bjs> sonny: but if you decide to just try expand things randomly without looking at the input then yes you could infinitely loop, but that would be a silly thing to do

[03:49:09] <sonny> bjs: yeah so termination is implicit
[03:49:30] <bjs> sonny: well it's more that grammars aren't programs or machines so "termination" isn't really a question
[03:49:34] <flakland> that's typically what high level languages try to acheive, independence from specific machines
[03:49:53] <sonny> oh, ok
[03:51:16] <bjs> sonny: the process of "take a non-terminal and randomly substitute it with one of the options" is a process that might not terminate for many grammars.
[03:51:47] <bjs> sonny: but it's not as interesting as it sounds because "execute a Python program by jumping to a random line each time" also might not ever terminate but it doesn't say much about the program :)
[03:52:12] <epony> it's calculating relations discarding the machine and real machines have real constraints (which one of you already acknowledged as if it was some fundamental limitation that they want to not adhere to) so, is discarded from the machine programming and put into a very high level for theoretic computation modelling

[03:58:21] <bjs> sonny: if you're careful with how you write your grammar you can tell what the next symbol could be so you can choose that way,  in general you may have to try one choice but then "backtrack" to try another
[03:58:27] * epony downgrades flakland to iterator
[03:58:40] <flakland> using a heap-based stack

[04:32:04] <ProfSimm> flakland: I think the point is that arrays as an addressing semantic is just the interface to the data, i.e. abstract. It's not actually a flat array in hardware.
[04:32:15] <epony> flakland, you're irrational and not very coherent either.
[04:32:18] <flakland> there is no point to epony's rantings
[04:32:27] <ProfSimm> It's in fact not even flat array in the interface because of page remapping and so on
[04:32:32] <ProfSimm> But it's ostensibly an array I guess
[04:32:38] <flakland> trying to imagine there is some kind of point is a bad decision
[04:33:08] <epony> flakland, you were called pointless earlier ;-) which is inoriginal repetition at this point so might as well drop it
[04:33:32] <ProfSimm> Well, anyway everything is abstract. Everything is a model of a model of a model. In a million years we'll have disentangled half the universe and we still won't be closer to reality, it's all models.

[07:02:36] <teut> jdbc:postgresql:[//host[:port]/][database][?property1=value1[&property2=value2]...]Â Â Â Â  so this kind of string is parsed by the operating system?
[07:02:50] <PlanckWalk> Probably because it's not necessarily on the stack.
[07:03:04] <PlanckWalk> It's probably going to smash some other segment instead.
[07:03:12] <PlanckWalk> (Wherever string literals are kept)
[07:03:17] <MsFoxyEmilySmith> teut: u need to write your own grammer to parse that
[07:03:23] <MsFoxyEmilySmith> should be easy
[07:03:30] <aklsdf> PlanckWalk: but if i used hello and test, it work error.
[07:04:18] <teut> no, no, I installed mongodb yesterday and wasted few hours in thinking how to use that with a nodejs application
[07:04:25] <abraxis> aklsdf: if assigning a value to a var bleeds into the next var because it's too big, it's stack smashing. The compiler may or may not detect this.

[07:20:25] <abraxis> you said you didn't want to use a connector. running psql gives you direct access to the db
[07:21:07] <PlanckWalk> When it gets a connection string, it looks for drivers that will handle that string (in this case, a JBDC driver for PostgreSQL)
[07:21:39] <teut> and for mongodb?
[07:21:47] <PlanckWalk> Other languages often have their own libraries for handling database connections

[07:26:17] <PlanckWalk> Often databases run in their own process, yes.
[07:26:17] <teut> thanks , that was what I wanted to know
[07:26:29] <PlanckWalk> The command-line tools then communicate with that process.

[07:31:08] <duuude> But the problems with it are same as GPL, just on steroids
[07:31:48] <duuude> vdamewood: Yeah, I am talking about the license. GPL is not compatible with any extra restrictions
[07:32:19] <vdamewood> duuude: the GPLv3 had a short list of extra requirements it allows.

[07:33:15] <oldlaptop> the sqlite documentation itself does speak of "connections", but it doesn't mean any kind of network connection; an sqlite "connection" is just a C struct

[07:37:07] <oldlaptop> It acts kind of like a "connection" in some kind of client/server database library, if you squint at it, but of course some of the things it lets you do (like defining SQL functions that simply call a C function in your application to compute the result) could not be implemented if it were a real network connection, or at least couldn't be implemented very efficiently
[07:38:06] <teut> ok so any C based language like python can access the data structures directly then
[07:38:32] <duuude> not much to do with C-basedness

[14:53:16] <Inst> comparison is FP-type recursion
[14:53:18] <pikapika> Decker, the simplest is to just manually maintain a stack
[14:53:28] <pikapika> ie to convert "recursion" to "iteration"
[14:53:32] <Decker> pikapika fortunatly the mechanics of calling a function takes care of that
[14:53:43] <Decker> yes you can implement your own recursion stack and do a while loop to process it
[14:53:54] <Decker> which is recursion=while=for=goto top
[14:54:03] <pikapika> Exactly
[14:54:12] <Inst> wait, in which languages are for loops mandatorily bounded?
[14:54:13] <pikapika> "jnz" and "jmp" are all you need
[14:54:15] <bjs> Inst: you can always re-write recursive functions into while loops, with an explicit variable to store a stack. For loops in our real languages aren't always bounded. 
[14:54:31] <bjs> So there's some caveats when applying these kind of arguments to "real" languages
[14:54:43] <Inst> what is a unreal language?
[14:54:56] <pikapika> Decker, I mean there are some practical benefits to maintaining your own stack frames
[14:55:05] <pikapika> The main thing is that you avoid stack smashing
[14:55:16] <bjs> Inst: one that is used as an ideal when describing the theory
[14:55:17] <pikapika> for algorithms that might potentially go deep into recursion
[14:55:21] <Decker> certainly - no excess prefix/postfix code for function calling

[15:22:10] <bjs> Inst: I'm not sure about timescales,  but I'm sure that day 1 of your intro to programming in Python course would not have you doing OOP or IO
[15:22:19] <Inst> no, she finished it
[15:22:21] <Inst> it was a winter course
[15:22:39] <Inst> it was bizarre, 3 weeks in the kiddy pool, then all ofa  sudden the instructor inflicts hard algorithmic problems so he can get the grading curve he wants

[15:40:12] <Inst> is it really that hard to teach?

[15:42:36] <bjs> Inst: yes we use OCaml,  it used to be Standard ML
[15:42:37] <Inst> i mean that Haskell is killed off because students getting out of intro Haskell classes decide that Haskell is useless
[15:42:52] <bjs> for new programmers the first language choice doesn't -really- matter so much

[15:43:02] <bjs> so long as it's not piet
[15:43:04] <bjs> or something
[15:43:09] <Guest_2211> haskell is taught for an insight into programming
[15:43:16] <Guest_2211> like [pascal
[15:43:48] <Inst> yeah
[15:44:01] <Inst> intro to FP, you never get to touch the IO monad
[15:44:05] <bjs> Inst: by the time you call yourself a "programmer" you might not even be using the first language you learned anymore, it doesn't make a big difference as once you've learned one or two languages the others become simpler to pick up
[15:44:15] <Inst> if you're uni-trained, of course
[15:44:27] <Inst> python isn't big because MIT ditched Scheme for Javascript for Python

I also installed microk8s which also uss containerd. Both things work. Except both docker and micrk8s seem to have separate containerd instances so I don't see microk8s containers when I do docker ps. Can someone help?

[21:43:49] <Kerr> I have a class (called scene) that I want to have two methods that will get called by the program. One of them is to be called at the beginning of a frame, where it is supposed to populate a std::stack with all the things the scene wants the renderer to draw this frame. The next method is meant to run concurrently to the renderer doing it's work,
[21:43:50] <Kerr> where the scene is supposed to have a chance to modify it's internal state. IE, make a drawing list, then advance the simulation (although I mean for scenes to be more general, a menu is a scene, and so is a whole game)... Maybe this seems silly, but I can't come up with a good *name* for the two methods haha, any suggestions?

[23:37:11] <tomathy> ah yes goto
[23:37:43] <tomathy> i like your idea but can it work
[23:37:46] <Decker> you can use 0 or 1 * a thing to select if it's part of a result
[23:38:12] <flakland> of course it can work, but it wont be usable without ridicule

[23:53:43] <KillerWasp> I had started developing emulators for Atari 2600, TurboGraf, and ARM processor, but there is no clear motivation to continue or finish, so they are dead.
[23:54:10] <tomathy> probably due to the continuously changing nature of modern technology

[23:54:48] <luizfrds> in html / javascript, there is anyway i can trigger an event when i change a property on a div?
