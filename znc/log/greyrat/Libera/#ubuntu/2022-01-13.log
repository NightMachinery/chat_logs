[02:55:42] <anzer> hi jhutchins, i'm using headphones with a mic. Apple Earpods
[02:59:17] <jhutchins> anzer: Any interesting effects depending on how far in the plug goes?  Push it in a little farther, or listen while you slowly move it in and out?
[03:00:08] <anzer> jhutchins, actually yes. It's like the jack is broken or something, but it works great on my iPod. I'm starting to think it is hardware problem.
[03:00:23] <MrCollinsGA> look at the rings. are there two rings? one ring? 3 rings on the hack

[03:09:01] <matsaman> maybe you're mixing ALSA & OSS audio

[05:44:06] <sarnold> okay, next guess -- you may have data hiding "underneath" a mount point
[05:44:34] <Kilroy> found it
[05:44:37] <sarnold> yay?
[05:45:04] <Kilroy> yes I have a script that runs the backups and I guess the backups have been going to the backup folder /backup not the backupdrive /backup
[05:45:09] <sarnold> if that's it, I'd be curious how you found it so quickly ;) the 'best' thing I could think of was to umount the other filesystems...
[05:45:10] <Kilroy> that was 171 GB
[05:45:15] <sarnold> yay :D
[05:45:25] <Kilroy> back down to normal /dev/sda2             196G  5.6G  181G   3% /
[05:45:37] <sarnold> .. and umounting the other filesystems can sometimes be a real chore, or impossible to do short of a reboot, etc
[05:45:41] <sarnold> muuuuch better
[05:45:51] <Kilroy> yea, I forgot to check that
[05:46:19] <Kilroy> b/c I knew it had done that before and forgot about it until you said "hiding "underneath" a mount point"

[07:00:23] <matsaman> Kilroy: let me find you the stats on how many houses burn to the ground specifically from bad electrical
[07:00:35] <Kilroy> something that I can show in my house
[07:00:58] <leftyfb> Kilroy: hire your own electrician and have them come and look at things when they aren't around. Have the electrician tell your parents there's an issue
[07:01:02] <matsaman> Kilroy: a tripped breaker is that
[07:01:10] <matsaman> it's a safety feature, it's the whole purpose of the breaker
[07:01:13] <matsaman> to disable power
[07:01:24] <jhutchins> Scorch/burn marks under the face plates are usually convincing.  You might want to turn the breaker off before you pull the plates and look.
[07:01:40] <Kilroy> face plates of what?
[07:01:52] <matsaman> of a switch or outlet box
[07:01:56] <jhutchins> Kilroy: Switches & outlets.
[07:01:57] <Kilroy> ok
[07:02:04] <matsaman> don't though =P
[07:02:20] <jhutchins> matsaman: ?
[07:02:58] <leftyfb> Kilroy: either way, this is completely offtopic here. I hate to give you the bad news, but it's better than you ignoring it. We can't help beyond telling you to get a licensed electrician in there to diagnose further. Make sure to tell/show the electrician the issues you have come across
[07:03:24] <Kilroy> ok thanks for your helps
[07:03:35] <jhutchins> Kilroy: You can still try the tests we suggested, they're not hazardous.

[07:06:42] <Kilroy> ok, thank you jhutchins
[07:07:38] <matsaman> you can probably get an electrician to come in for slim-to-nothing and tell you if it might be just the breaker needs replacing (for the computer thing), which should be relatively affordable in parts in labor
[07:07:48] <matsaman> the other light switch thing is less good =P
[07:08:37] <matsaman> unless it's just an overcomplicated 3-way setup, which it could still be <shrug>

[07:16:32] <Kilroy> and when that started happning I told my dad that he should get someone out here, and he said that it is fine

I looked around and I can't really find a good reason that it exists and the
[14:37:12] <Guest69> author did not elaborate on this further. So, I guess I'm here to try and understand why someone might include this. What's the point of it?

[14:47:38] <Guest69> Does this also mean that partitions 1,2, and 3 are MBR while partition 5 is GPT?

[14:49:44] <tomreyn> plus you could boot with either system if the respective boot manager is installed.

[14:51:50] <tomreyn> so you can save 2 MB by not hving the EF02 grub bios boot partition
[14:52:21] <Guest69> I feel a bit more confident about the guide now, so I guess I'll continue on and try it. The real hard part, however, is going to be including a few other encrypted PVs into the VG and using only 1 password to unlock everything. :D
[14:52:56] <Guest69> Yeah, I have about 6TB of space to work with, so I don't think I'll ever miss those 2MB
[14:54:32] <Guest69> Thanks for the help :)  I'll let you know if it worked, if you're interested.
[14:55:33] <tomreyn> "a few other encrypted PVs" probably means you will have multiple LUKS (?) encrypted storages, each of which will need to be encrypted and decrypted seperately.
[14:56:23] <Guest69> Yeah, but I think I can set one password and then use keyfiles for the rest and chain them in /etc/crypttab

[17:38:05] <tomreyn> it might be useful then, but note that those messages can also get in yourway, i.e. if you're editing some file and a wall message comes up, that can be annoying since it would overwrite the editor screen.
