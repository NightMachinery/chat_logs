[04:48:27] <manicennui> In Alabama, they give you a gun and a driver's license when you turn 12 if you are a man.
[04:48:44] <manicennui> No test required.
[05:29:13] <quanticle> manicennui: Eh, that map is misleading statistics
[05:29:22] <quanticle> Road deaths per million people isn't a great metric
[05:29:30] <quanticle> A better metric is road deaths per miles driven
[05:29:45] <quanticle> Like, yes, of course the US has more road deaths, because in the US people drive a lot more
[05:30:13] <quanticle> And in places like New Mexico, or Wyoming, they drive a *lot* more
[05:30:19] <quanticle> Because everything is so sparse
[05:30:56] <manicennui> quanticle: It's still hard to explain why the stats line up so well with political affiliation in the US specifically.
[05:31:02] <quanticle> And it seems like it's biased towards Republicans because duh, Republicans live in rural areas
[05:31:13] <manicennui> There are plenty of states with lower deaths where people have to drive everywhere.
[05:31:21] <quanticle> No, I just explained it
[05:31:26] <manicennui> No, you didn't.
[05:31:30] <quanticle> Republicans live in rural areas, rural areas drive more
[05:31:35] <quanticle> No further explanation needed
[05:31:57] <manicennui> There are rural states that are not red or gray.
[05:32:46] <quanticle> Like which? Nebraska? Nebraska has Omaha
[05:32:53] <quanticle> It's not a big city, but it is a city
[05:34:57] <quanticle> And heck, you can look at Minnesota vs. Wisconsin to see exactly what I'm talking about. Minnesota has pretty much all its population squeezed into the Minneapolis-St. Paul, Duluth and Rochester. Hence: road deaths per million people is green. Wisconsin has its population smeared across a bunch of smaller towns, with lots of driving in between. Hence road deaths: yellow
[05:35:36] <quanticle> But I bet if you used road deaths per million miles driven, the states would be about the same
[05:37:33] <manicennui> Someone looked it up. The US is near the bottom (worst).
[05:37:41] <manicennui> But keep going with those mental gynmastics.
[05:38:32] <manicennui> Ignore that there is no reason for AL, MS, SC, KY, and TN to be the worst in the US.
[05:39:30] <companion_cube> I wish these also had pedestrian and bike deaths
[05:39:59] <quanticle> https://www.iihs.org/topics/fatality-statistics/detail/state-by-state
[05:40:01] <buttsbot> State by state
[05:40:08] <quanticle> Yeah, that's a much different breakdown than the map
[05:46:02] <manicennui> Is it?
[05:46:28] <manicennui> Wyoming and Kentucky are still the worst...
[05:46:55] <manicennui> Wow, MS is even worse.
[05:47:01] <manicennui> Keeping their rep as the worst at everything.
[05:52:31] <quanticle> I put the data into a spreadsheet: https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/15n491o08hm1jby8w8iu4/road_death_stats.xlsx?dl=0&rlkey=f783ltpi8y9jbpnzawbp8yho9
[05:52:32] <buttsbot> Dropbox - road_death_stats.xlsx
[05:53:33] <manicennui> To prove yourself wrong?
[05:53:38] <manicennui> I mean, the same trend still exists.
[05:53:43] <manicennui> A few states switched positions.
[05:55:22] <quanticle> Eh, maybe I'm wrong here
[05:56:57] <quanticle> But like, Delaware, for example, jumps up a lot
[05:57:48] <quanticle> Kentucky moves around, but it's still near the top
[05:57:54] <quanticle> Okay, I guess you're right
[05:58:47] <manicennui> I mean, my comment was mostly flippant
[05:59:00] <manicennui> I realize that it's probably correlation with several things.
[05:59:13] <quanticle> Yeah, but like... this was good!
[05:59:18] <manicennui> I would like to point out that AL and MS are the worst at fucking everything.
[05:59:24] <quanticle> Forced me to look at the actual fucking data
[05:59:29] <quanticle> Make a spreadsheet and everything
[05:59:41] <quanticle> Generate a hypothesis, and get proven wrong
[05:59:46] <manicennui> Are people there just miserable as fuck?
[05:59:47] <quanticle> Literally doing science here
[06:04:53] <manicennui> Maybe being the worst at education makes them ignorant of how much better things could be.
[06:05:26] <quanticle> Yeah, I dunno maybe everyone who's actually dissatisfied with their situation leaves
[06:05:59] <quanticle> Like, all those people migrating to California are coming from *somewhere*
[06:06:05] <quanticle> Or Seattle or what have you

[06:47:00] <manicennui> I'll never understand why people donate to random gofundme campaigns.

[06:47:13] <manicennui> There is just no way to know.
[06:47:47] <Xe> manicennui: gofundme is one of the major healthcare financers in the US
[06:47:55] <manicennui> I know.
[06:47:57] <Xe> this is all because of the lack of single payer
[06:48:01] <manicennui> I just don't get why people give to them.

[09:44:43] <HankHill> My issues is that there were more stand alone episodes then ones directly related to the plot... which is a problem since they split the season into two and thus only gave us 12 episodes...

[09:55:36] <manicennui> I know it is popular in Japan, but I'm curious about just how popular it is.
[09:56:25] <manicennui> Even with the MCU doing well here, comic books are still not at all popular, and the MCU is barely about the comics.
[09:56:49] <manicennui> It's more of the typical summer blockbuster schlock that happens to have characters inspired by comic books.
[10:11:31] <bontaq> that star wars visions thing looks cool manicennui, better than the usual star wars themepark news
[10:12:39] <manicennui> Probably helps that it was done by Japanese anime studios.
