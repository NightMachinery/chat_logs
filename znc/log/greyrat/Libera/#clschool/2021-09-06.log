[22:46:35] <lisp123_> It's a recursive path, which doesn't seem to end

[23:09:15] <beach> lisp123_: (cons (car b) (cdr b))?
[23:09:18] <beach> Seriously?
[23:09:52] <thrig> 2 2 'wtf (* ** ***)
[23:10:11] <beach> lisp123_: Also, try using the backquote reader macro.
[23:12:19] <beach> lisp123_: Another possibility is to use LOOP with destructuring.
[23:13:15] <beach> lisp123_: [untested] (loop for (variable form) in bindings collect `(,variable (,variable ,form)))
[23:14:11] <lisp123_> beach: Thanks! Guess I have been struggling writing my first macros, hence the ridiculous fallback to (cons car cdr)
[23:15:04] <lisp123_> I wanted to do it without the extra make-bindforms function (I assume this is what you mean by using the backquote reader macro), but I got confused on how to do  it
[23:15:46] <beach> I meant `(,(car b) ,b) rather than (list (car b) b)
[23:16:14] <pjb> lisp123_: when you write functions to be used by macros, at macroexpansion time, you must ensute that those functions are known to the compiler at macroexpansion time.
[23:16:15] <beach> For code, the backquote macro makes it look more like the resulting code.
[23:16:16] <lisp123_> Ah I see, yes that I can understand
[23:16:35] <beach> Anyway, I'm off to spend time with my (admittedly small) family.
[23:16:41] <lisp123_> Enjoy :)
[23:17:02] <lisp123_> pjb: thanks
[23:17:09] <pjb> lisp123_: this can be done 2 ways: 1- put those functions in a separate file, compile it first, and load it before compiling the files that defines the macro (so that you don't get a warning about undefined funcitons), and compile and load that file containing the macro before the files that use the macro.
[23:17:32] <pjb> lisp123_: 2- wrap the function in an (eval-when (:compile-toplevel :load-toplevel :execute) â€¦) form.
[23:18:49] <pjb> lisp123_:  the first solution is why you may have files named packages.lisp macfun.lisp macros.lisp my-program.lisp  so that you may compile and load them each in turn, since each is needed to load and compile the following.
[23:18:54] <lisp123_> pjb: Thanks, I will use the latter
[23:19:19] <pjb> it's simplier, but sometimes the macro is complex and needs a lot of functions (eg. it could be a whole compiler).
[23:19:43] <thrig> FLET them eat cake
[23:19:43] <lisp123_> And its not possible to simply put the function in the same file, but above?
[23:20:04] <pjb> No, because CL doesn't ask the compiler to load into itself the functions it compiles. 
[23:20:23] <pjb> It only asks the compiler to know that there is such a function, and not issue warning about undefined functions.
[23:20:48] <pjb> To load the function into the compiler, you need to do it explicitely with a load before compile-file, or with eval-when.
[23:21:18] <lisp123_> pjb: Thanks!
[23:21:25] *** Quits: thrig (~thrig@65.113.153.50) (Remote host closed the connection)
[23:22:46] <pjb> lisp123_: (list (car b) (cons (car b) (cdr b))) can be replaced by: (list* (car b) (car b) (cdr b))
[23:23:02] <pjb> list* is like cons, but for lists.
[23:23:12] <pjb> (list* 1 2 3 '(4 5 6)) #| --> (1 2 3 4 5 6) |# 
[23:24:05] <lisp123_> Oh I never knew that, thanks
[23:24:21] <lisp123_> Is it an old function from the predecessors of CL?
[23:24:33] <pjb> Probably.
[23:24:35] <pjb> Note: (with ((+ 1 2) (* 3 4)) (+ + *)) works too ;-)
[23:25:13] <pjb> But + - * and / are declared special so they name dynamic variables.
[23:26:54] <lisp123_> Interesting
[23:27:15] <lisp123_> Because the first + is looked up as a function?
[23:27:29] <lisp123_> According to the evaluation rules?
[23:27:32] <pjb> Another function that work like lisp* is apply: (apply '+ 1 2 3 '(4 5 6)) #| --> 21 |#
[23:27:34] <lisp123_> (this is in the last form)
[23:28:47] <lisp123_> Yep, apply I have used a few times before (probably should use it more)
[23:29:06] <pjb> lisp123_: It's because the rules in 11.2.1.2 explicitely allows you to bind variables named with symbols from CL.
[23:29:23] <pjb> lisp123_: (with ((sin alpha) (cos alpha)) (+ sin cos)) works too ;-)
[23:29:38] <pjb> In this case, sin and cos are lexical variables.
[23:29:42] <lisp123_> That makes sense :)
[23:30:13] <lisp123_> Somewhat the reason for my 'with' macro - to re-use names for both variables & functions
[23:31:20] <lisp123_> I think it makes the language much more readable (but that's just me ;) to reuse symbols
[23:33:24] <lisp123_> Thanks for your help pjb, much appreciated. I've saved down the notes as well for future ref
