[03:57:21] <LeoNerd> Yup. Seems to be in my testing 5.35.10
[03:57:26] <tirnanog> fan-bloody-tastic
[03:57:43] <aquanight> by "gone" do you mean "disabled by feature bundle/use VERSION"
[03:57:44] <LeoNerd> Yet another reason to  use VERSION
[03:57:49] <LeoNerd> Yup
[03:57:51] <aquanight> or do you mean really really gone
[03:58:43] <LeoNerd> It can't *disappear* for a long time yet. But feature bundles 5.35 onwards no longer enable it
[03:59:18] <aquanight> while I agree with 'use VERSION' in principle, in practice a lot of times your 'use VERSION' is going to not necesarily be the newest and greatest
[03:59:34] <aquanight> e.g. I think I mostly target use v5.30;

[04:00:03] <aquanight> if there's one thing I'd like
[04:00:14] <aquanight> and preferably backparted via CPAN feature.pm or something
[04:00:38] <LeoNerd> 5.36 has a lot of niceness. Adds non-experimental signatures, isa; removes smartmatch, switch, indirect
[04:00:52] <aquanight> use feature qw(thing1 thing2 -indirect); ## equivalent to use feature qw(thing1 thing2); no feature qw(indirect);
[04:01:16] <aquanight> I still say smartmatch got a raw deal
[04:01:43] <LeoNerd> Perhaps, but it's still terrible
[04:02:00] <aquanight> some of the comparisons supported by smartmatch I believe still are not relatively easily expressed
[04:02:09] *** Joins: jpn (~jpn@user/jpn)
[04:02:13] <ether> it was a good idea that went too far
[04:02:56] <LeoNerd> Most of smartmatch's craziness is better expressed with `any`
[04:03:14] <LeoNerd> Though admittedly that doesn't work as well in a match/case statement
[04:04:10] <aquanight> ARRAY ~~ ARRAY I believe doesn't have something sufficiently eloquent
[04:04:24] * aquanight checks L:U again
[04:04:28] <LeoNerd> What does that even /mean/ though?
[04:05:02] <ether> is array1 a subset of array2
[04:05:04] <aquanight> ~~ defines it as basically "sequence equality"
[04:05:06] <LeoNerd> Does it find -any- common element? Do they have to be the same length and match piecewise..?
[04:05:37] <LeoNerd> Subset? Sublist?
[04:05:42] <ether> the array and hash matching is fine. it's when it gets into the scalar stuff that it all falls apart, because strings are not numbers are not regexes, and you don't know at compile time what you're going to get so it's hard to predict behaviour.
[04:05:52] <LeoNerd> That'd four different and equally plausible meanings I
[04:05:59] <aquanight> $#$x == $#$y && List::Util::all { $x->[$_] == $y->[$_] } keys @$x
[04:05:59] <LeoNerd> 've just suggested
[04:06:11] <aquanight> I understand it can be interpreted as such
[04:06:13] <LeoNerd> I can therefore guarantee at least 3 of them are wrong
[04:06:15] <aquanight> I'm reading the description in perlop
[04:06:25] <aquanight> and I am saying it's not eloquently expressed currently
[04:07:05] <LeoNerd> It's just too complex an operator.. to have to even remember or think
[04:07:07] <aquanight> but I believe the expression I listed (assuming numeric contents, in practice the element comparison is recursive ~~)

[04:17:11] <aquanight> The fact that you have to *ask* for it, specifically.
[04:17:20] <aquanight> Then again, perl has use strict; so perhaps we should not throw stones.
[04:17:25] <LeoNerd> simcop2387: ON ERROR KEEP CALM AND CARRY ON
[04:17:35] <simcop2387> on error resume next is worse than php
[04:17:37] <comet23> i think python is the greatest language ever made because of the large amounts of libraries at our disposal
[04:17:38] <aquanight> believe it or not
[04:17:51] <simcop2387> comet23: javascript has more libraries
[04:17:56] <aquanight> ON ERROR RESUME NEXT makes actual sense in VBA once you get down to the nitty gritty of what VBA actually is and what's going on
[04:18:02] <aquanight> which is that VBA is a wrapper around COM/OLE
[04:18:09] <aquanight> so what VBA is calling an "error"
[04:18:21] <aquanight> is some COM function returning an HRESULT with the fail bit
[04:18:53] <comet23> simcop2387 more libraries for different subjects like graphics, machine learning, ai, math, etc...???
[04:19:06] <comet23> if that's the case then javascript is the greatest language of all time lol
[04:19:08] <simcop2387> comet23: more libraries at least
[04:19:16] <comet23> but they have to be just as good
[04:19:25] <comet23> quality is important imo
[04:21:03] <aquanight> so OERN allows you to just handle the failed HRESULT inline

[04:22:03] <aquanight> also really libraries aren't what makes a language good
[04:22:10] <aquanight> it just means people were bored and wrote libraries at best
[04:22:15] <aquanight> arguably
[04:22:22] <aquanight> VBA can access every COM/OLE server installed on your system
[04:22:29] <aquanight> if something's made a COM API, VBA can access it
[04:23:20] <simcop2387> embedding com objects in powerpoint was fun during school.  wasn't blocked by the security stuff like vba was
[04:23:54] <x5c30> . o O ( package Midnight::Hour; require More::More::More; with "Rebel::Yell"; More::More::More->more->more->more; )
[04:25:12] <aquanight> I do remember at one point going absolute apeshit trying to find cool COM objects I could play with just from what came installed with the OS
[04:25:18] <simcop2387> eval: Zathras->sing("midnight::hour")->more->more->more
[04:25:19] <perlbot> simcop2387: \"Zathras->sing(midnight::hour)->more->more->more"
[04:25:36] <simcop2387> Zathras is a do everything class
[04:30:31] <aquanight> at one point I got a hold of a very basic standalone VB6 and started trying to do stuff with that
[04:30:43] <aquanight> but it was still very COM-oriented

[04:31:59] <aquanight> it was not a separate process from the program being debugged
[04:32:16] <aquanight> which got you in big hot water if you were not super careful with Win32 API usage
[04:32:37] <aquanight> because "save files before running" was not a default option
[04:33:07] <aquanight> so one whoopsie and 3 hours of splicing together whatever batshittery you were up to was promptly defenstrated
[04:33:33] <aquanight> oh and I did all this under Win98. The OS where if you were epically bad you'd fuck the whole system.
[04:35:13] <xenu> 01:01 < aquanight> it was not a separate process from the program being debugged

[04:36:26] <LeoNerd> Devel::MAT to the rescue ;)
[04:36:37] <aquanight> CORE::dump to the rescue
[04:36:38] <LeoNerd> ... maybe. sometimes. in a few specific scenarios
[04:36:56] <aquanight> listen I'm not saying I'd debug perl by single-stepping with gdb.
[04:37:20] <aquanight> I'd certainly debug xs by singlestepping with gdb.
[04:37:28] <xenu> you aren't a real programmer if you need more than just a memory dump
[04:37:34] <LeoNerd> I do most of my debug by print-to-stderr
[04:37:52] <LeoNerd> Except on 8bit AVRs where it's print-to-blinking-LED
[04:37:58] <xenu> also for xs i prefer windbg
[04:38:01] <xenu> much nicer
[04:38:03] <aquanight> it took me wait too long trying to fix Attribute::Pure by staring at memory dumps
[04:38:09] <xenu> just its command names are insane
[04:38:11] <aquanight> and it was one stupid little typo that
[04:38:13] <LeoNerd> (though actually sometimes I have a serial console even there)
[04:38:42] <LeoNerd> Can still   fprintf(stderr, "D1: x=%02x\n", x);  on one of those :)
[04:38:52] <aquanight> but what if you're debugging the serial driver
[04:39:05] <LeoNerd> That's when I use LEDs
[04:39:14] <xenu> but what if you're debugging leds
[04:39:14] <aquanight> but what if you're debugging the LED driver
[04:39:18] <aquanight> xenu: lol
[04:39:42] <LeoNerd> LEDs are just "set a pin", not a lot can go wrong there
[04:40:32] <aquanight> the places where not a lot can go wrong are exactly the places where everything can go wrong
[04:41:32] <xenu> yeah, the red led doesn't work, you try everything to debug it and it turns out you're colorblind
[04:42:40] <aquanight> if I had a nickel for every time I've wrote a block of code that I was sure couldn't fuck up. Only for it to promptly fuck up.
[04:42:46] <aquanight> Usually because I've misspelt something.
[04:43:22] <aquanight> but then again maybe I'm just bad at this. Whatever.

[04:45:44] <v`> ofc i can't resist regex golf so that's kinda self-inflicted i guess
[04:46:31] <aquanight> my approach is: 1) hackjob together something I think will do what I want. 2) assume I fucked up. 3) guess where I fucked up and start putting STDERR->prints all over. 4) Analyze the memory dump because none of the prints actually fired.
[04:46:59] <aquanight> oh I can't forget
[04:47:13] <aquanight> 1.5) fight with the buildsystem for 7.4 days because perl has too many and I don't understand any of them.
[04:48:59] <xenu> (two)

[23:14:18] <v`> but for things like supermarket i'm like "eh... i guess if they want to aggregate that i like green grapes or whatever then that'll happen..."
[23:16:01] <v`> pulling out my phone and paying with apple or google pay and puting my phone back is so fluid for me its like one fluid motion which i like when its like that
[23:16:28] <lopid> sounds like that'd be awesome to watch
[23:16:50] <v`> you'd should hear the soundtrack that accompanies it
[23:16:53] <v`> it's oscar-worthy
[23:16:55] <lopid> did that guy just pay for groceries or give birth to a rainbow?
[23:17:28] <pragma-> pulling out my chipped card and putting it in the chip reader and then putting it away is fluid enough for me

[23:18:39] <v`> so any supermarket transaction is tug tug f**king thing get out of my pocket
