[11:25:01] <bananahead> Hi all, I'm trying to restrict the updating of a model field, if the model has >=1 children records. Now I know I can do this in the model clean method, but this is triggering even when the data has not changed. What would be the best course of action.
[11:25:26] <bananahead> I have heard it might be best to implement logic in the form, but ideally I dont want my validation logic to be spread in multiple places.
[11:29:54] <GinFuyou> Validation logic is split between model and form generally anyway

[11:49:46] <bananahead> GinFuyou: just wanted to avoid some validations happening in the model, and some in the form.
[11:50:04] <bananahead> Curious if there was a way to do this only on the model.
[11:51:09] <bananahead> The issue is that the field is part of a form with other fields. So if I update any other field but leave the field I really care about untouched, the validation still runs, even though it hasnt been changed.

[14:22:02] <dminuoso> Hi. I have a table that I end up using with some `PROVISION_CHANGE_COUNT = '<span>{{ record.changesets.count }}</span>'` - and as naive as this was, this produces N+1 queries.

[15:25:23] <thefuture> Hello awesome people, I'm trying to combine multiple indexes for a database. What would be the best way to go about this with django? I have already tried multi-column indexing using the default b-tree index. Testing on my local instance shows increased performance. However, testing in production shows that look-up time is worse than before. Is combining multiple indexes a good idea? Any help will be most appreciated. Thank you.
[15:26:47] <nbjoerg> which database?
[15:27:06] <thefuture> I'm using postgres
[15:30:54] <nbjoerg> did you run analyze after creating the indices?

[18:59:16] <mad_moses> Where is the collation setting coming from? Did django create the tables with the wrong collation (in my case) or is this kind of a system default?
[19:00:25] <hylje> django doesn't do anything special for mysql/mariadb, consider something like https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49316327/how-to-set-collation-in-mysql-database-with-django-2-mysqlclient

[19:05:49] <pycode> i would like to add new Items on those Section

I tried proxy models (and overriding get_queryset on the model admin inherited from the original model) but those have the strange side-effect of creating an empty migration. I suppose this is really fine but it just bothers me and I'm wondering if there are any other ways beyond a custom view in admin?
