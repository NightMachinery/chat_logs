[03:17:16] <FunkyBob> that's why there's a t emplate filter to convert newlines to <br>
[03:17:21] <PaulWay[w]> Yes, because that's the way HTML works.
[03:17:21] <FunkyBob> it depends on how you're rendering it...
[03:17:28] <PaulWay[w]> It ignores newline characters.

[03:22:01] <FunkyBob> rannnn8888: HTML ignores all whitespace
[03:22:08] <PaulWay[w]> Yes, because that's the way that HTML works.
[03:22:15] <FunkyBob> so... is it that there's really no newline? or just that HTML ignores it?

[03:25:11] <rannnn8888> Its not me its the pro FunkyBob
[03:26:34] <PaulWay[w]> My static file serving is completely failing for reasons I cannot comprehend.
[03:27:00] <rannnn8888> FunkyBob What about the Israeli guy you told me about already back here?
[03:27:38] <PaulWay[w]> The static directory exists.  STATIC_URL and STATIC_ROOT are set.  I'm using django.views.static.serve.  File and directory permissions are fine.  But it keeps on insisting that none of my static files can be served.
[03:28:44] <PaulWay[w]> But the admin's static content is fine.
[03:31:03] <PaulWay[w]> What else am I missing?
[03:36:43] <FunkyBob> PaulWay[w]: are you sure STATICFILES_DIRS does not contain STATIC_ROOT ?
[03:36:45] <FunkyBob> a common mistake
[03:36:58] <rannnn8888> STATIC_URL = '/static/' STATICFILES_DIRS = [
[03:36:58] <rannnn8888>     os.path.join(BASE_DIR,'static'),
[03:36:59] <rannnn8888> ]
[03:37:00] <FunkyBob> why are you using django.views.static.serve directly?

[03:43:25] <PaulWay[w]> Yes, standard manage.py runserver

[04:29:57] <Rikem> a page on schinckel.net is an immediate hit, one I've visited before it would seem on that very subject

[04:38:15] <Rikem> django-tenant-schema looks nice
[04:44:43] <FunkyBob> the catch is... it requires some manual migration work
[04:44:52] <FunkyBob> though schinckel's work may make it easier
[04:45:25] <FunkyBob> the way I did it in the past is some middleware that calls a "set current user" custom functoin in the DB, setting up the state for the RLS to work from
[04:45:44] <FunkyBob> however, it also required dropping the DB connection after each request, so there's a performance hit

[05:12:11] <PaulWay[w]> Let me download his wisdom!
[05:14:12] <PaulWay[w]> OK, but that doesn't seem to handle the runserver situation.
[05:14:38] <PaulWay[w]> Is there any way for me to debug what's going wrong?  Where it's looking on the FS for the static files?
[05:14:56] <PaulWay[w]> I've tried putting files in project/myapp/static/ - they don't get found there.
[05:15:40] <FunkyBob> no, runserver doesn't use STATIC_ROOT
[05:15:51] <Rikem> PaulWay[w]: Something like https://dpaste.org/xQwe works for me
[05:16:03] <FunkyBob> but if you're using  runserver, you don't need to explicitly invoke the static serve views either, which you said you were doing
[05:16:10] <FunkyBob> did y ou didable DEBUG in settings, perhaps?
[05:16:29] <FunkyBob> you can use "findstatic" to see if/where it will find the file
[05:18:32] <FunkyBob> 22:21 < FunkyBob> why are you using django.views.static.serve directly?
[05:18:54] <FunkyBob> PaulWay[w]: hello?
[05:19:22] <PaulWay[w]> Yes, and when I remove that the same thing happens.
[05:19:31] <PaulWay[w]> I put it in because without it it didn't work.
[05:19:36] <PaulWay[w]> I'm trying everything I can here.
[05:19:43] <FunkyBob> remove which?
[05:19:51] <FunkyBob> static.serve?
[05:20:04] <FunkyBob> you might use that if you want to serve Media in dev... but not static
[05:20:57] <FunkyBob> is the problem that _none_ of your static files show?
[05:20:59] <FunkyBob> or only some of them?
[05:21:02] <PaulWay[w]> Yes, none of them.
[05:21:09] <PaulWay[w]> The admin app static files show.
[05:21:46] <FunkyBob> so not none of them
[05:22:07] <PaulWay[w]> None of my app's static files show.
[05:22:12] <PaulWay[w]> That's none of the ones I want.
[05:22:19] <FunkyBob> always great when someone gives you an answer, then immediately contradicts it
[05:22:30] <FunkyBob> ok... so... your apps are listed in INSTALLED_APS ?
[05:22:33] <FunkyBob> APPS
[05:22:37] <PaulWay[w]> Yes, the app works.
[05:22:47] <FunkyBob> that wasn't my question
[05:23:06] <PaulWay[w]> It works because it's in the list of INSTALLED_APPS.
[05:23:17] <FunkyBob> answer my question, not the one you make up
[05:23:27] <PaulWay[w]> Steady on there FunkyBob :-)
[05:23:40] <FunkyBob> pick a file from your static dir... and use "manage.py findstatic" to see if it finds it
[05:24:07] <PaulWay[w]> I've got the files `project/dictgame/static/game.css` and `project/static/game.css`.
[05:24:29] <PaulWay[w]> I have `STATIC_ROOT = BASE_DIR / 'static/'`
[05:24:32] <PaulWay[w]> set.
[05:24:44] <FunkyBob> right now we don't give a shit about STATIC_ROOT
[05:24:55] <FunkyBob> we want to know if django can find the files
[05:25:08] <FunkyBob> relative to manage.py ... where is this game.css ?
[05:25:09] <PaulWay[w]> And when I do `project/manage.py findstatic dictgame` it says "No matching file found for 'dictgame'."`
[05:25:29] <FunkyBob> is dictgame one of your static files?  looks like an app dir to me
[05:25:36] <PaulWay[w]> dictgame is my app.
[05:25:40] <PaulWay[w]> So, yes.
[05:25:51] <FunkyBob> so asking if the static machinery can find your app, is pointless
[05:25:58] <FunkyBob> try findstatic game.css
[05:26:14] <PaulWay[w]> OK, yes, that's found.
[05:26:19] <PaulWay[w]> In the app's static dir.
[05:26:28] <PaulWay[w]> Let me try reloading the page to see if that's got it now.
[05:26:40] <FunkyBob> but your browser gives a 404 when trying to load it?
[05:26:53] <Rikem> I have the opposite problem whilst following along with this
[05:27:05] <FunkyBob> Rikem: it finds too many static files?
[05:27:34] <Rikem> Oh, wait. I copied it from a production server
[05:27:53] <Rikem> the dirs are all wrong :D
[05:28:25] <PaulWay[w]> OK, I got a 404 from the runserver, so I quit it and restarted and now it gives a 200 for that file.
[05:28:43] <FunkyBob> PaulWay[w]: had you added the file after starting runserver?
[05:28:54] <PaulWay[w]> Yes.
[05:28:58] <PaulWay[w]> So that's a lesson learned.
[05:29:06] <FunkyBob> had you added the whole static dir after starting runserver?
[05:29:39] <PaulWay[w]> Yes - I had the static files in project/static/ and I'm now going to put them in project/dictgame/static/
[05:30:28] <FunkyBob> delete the static root
[05:30:33] <FunkyBob> delete thesetting, too
[05:30:46] <FunkyBob> you don't need them in development, and it will just confuse you
[05:30:50] <PaulWay[w]> Yep.  Ta.
[05:31:06] <FunkyBob> I suspect the static views cache a list of which apps have static dirs
[05:31:07] <PaulWay[w]> You seem aggressive FunkyBob.
[05:31:12] <FunkyBob> and that's where you ran into issues.
[05:31:17] <FunkyBob> do I?
[05:31:27] <PaulWay[w]> You're swearing at me.
[05:31:45] <Rikem> lol wut
[05:33:13] <PaulWay[w]> I can take it, it's just ... a bit odd compared to the FunkyBob I remember from a while back.
[05:34:12] <FunkyBob> you mean this?
[05:34:13] <FunkyBob> 00:09 < FunkyBob> right now we don't give a shit about STATIC_ROOT
[05:34:34] <PaulWay[w]> Yes.
[05:34:49] <PaulWay[w]> I'm really not interested in challenging you on this.
[05:34:50] <FunkyBob> well, the other efforts to get you to see it was irrelevant didn't seem to be getting through to you
[05:34:51] <Rikem> Not so much swearing at you but sweating for impact
[05:35:10] <Rikem> swearing*... the sweating comes with the job
[05:35:47] <PaulWay[w]> So the thing that caused me the problem was that I didn't know that runserver didn't check for the existence of a new static files directory in an app.
[05:35:59] <FunkyBob> yes
[05:36:06] <FunkyBob> once again, caching causes problems
[05:36:18] <PaulWay[w]> I was checking the 404s to see if I'd put the files in the right location.
[05:36:22] <FunkyBob> I'm only supposing that it caches that, but I think I've hit that before
[05:36:57] <FunkyBob> "findstatic" will let you resolve a {% static "name" %} from the CLI
[05:37:07] <FunkyBob> so you can test it that way in future
[05:37:17] <FunkyBob> also can help to explain why you might be getting  the wrong content
[05:37:27] <PaulWay[w]> Yep, thanks.
[05:37:32] <FunkyBob> if that hadn't solved the issue, we'd next move on to see if one of your url patterns was catching the request
[05:39:18] <PaulWay[w]> My big challenge with this game is going to be trying to run a real time interactive web application.
[05:39:32] <PaulWay[w]> That's the thing I've not done before.
[05:39:35] <PaulWay[w]> That and use HTMX.
[05:41:08] <FunkyBob> always interesting to see how different the definition of "realtime" is in web dev versus the rest of CS
[05:41:23] <PaulWay[w]> Yes.
[05:41:35] <PaulWay[w]> Well, web forms are 'interactive'.
[05:42:28] <FunkyBob> buttons and links are, too
[05:44:10] <PaulWay[w]> Yes, but I'm designing a game a bit like those 'trivia quiz' games, where once everyone's picked their answer then they're told the score, and then the next question is released by the compere, etc.
[05:44:35] <PaulWay[w]> I'm assuming I'm going to use web sockets.  Not entirely sure how, but that seems to be the tech :-)
[05:45:10] <FunkyBob> could use DOM-SSE, but WebSockets seem more popular now
[05:45:19] <PaulWay[w]> *nods*
[05:45:29] <FunkyBob> I built a web chat service using DOM-SSE

[05:46:37] <PaulWay[w]> Thanks, will have a look to see how much I can learn from this.
[05:46:50] <FunkyBob> it doesn't use django
[05:47:07] <FunkyBob> though the original did
[06:03:30] <PaulWay[w]> Great Shiznax, the number of online casinos that are sponsoring socket.io... :-)
[06:11:04] <FunkyBob> is that still a thing?
[06:11:23] <PaulWay[w]> Online casinos?  Or Shiznax?
[06:11:26] <PaulWay[w]> ;-)
[06:11:29] <FunkyBob> socket.io
[06:11:35] <PaulWay[w]> Heh.  Touche!
[06:12:03] <FunkyBob> Shiznax is nothing compared to Vectron
[06:12:22] <PaulWay[w]> True.  The Vectron-7 is a feared weapon of war.

[08:13:27] <PaulWay[w]> Not sure that makes sense.  Can you explain a bit more.
[08:13:29] <PaulWay[w]> ?
[08:14:27] <Safa_[A_Boy]> Writer.objects.prefetch_related(Prefetch("posts", Post.objects.order_by('-created_at'), "last_post"))
[08:14:42] <Safa_[A_Boy]> Just need the last post
[08:15:26] <PaulWay[w]> Well, you can slice that queryset, e.g. `Post.objects.order_by('created_at')[:1]`.
[08:15:55] <PaulWay[w]> Sorry, that should be `-created_at` in the order by, because I'm slicing on the first element.
[08:16:35] <PaulWay[w]> I feel like that's a better candidate for an annotation though.'
[08:17:17] <Safa_[A_Boy]> You can't: Cannot filter a query once a slice has been taken.
[08:17:35] <Safa_[A_Boy]> annotation is one column, I need full record
[08:23:42] <PaulWay[w]> Fair point.  I was thinking of say just the post ID.
[08:24:38] <PaulWay[w]> I'm not sure Prefetch is the right mechanism for you then.

[08:27:51] <Safa_[A_Boy]> Then what would a better mechanism be? Just a note, I'm using this for my API (Django REST)
[08:29:10] <PaulWay[w]> So you're using DRF Serializers?

[08:30:26] <Safa_[A_Boy]> Yes
[08:31:25] <PaulWay[w]> I'd make 'last_post' a method of the Writer model, that returns a single Post object for that writer.
[08:31:36] <Safa_[A_Boy]> N+1?
[08:31:44] <PaulWay[w]> Yes, but you've already got that problem.
[08:31:57] <Safa_[A_Boy]> Well, I'm trying to not get it again :P
[08:32:49] <PaulWay[w]> The problem you have is that the Prefetch is not just getting one post.  It's getting the posts related to each of the writers in your queryset.
[08:33:50] <PaulWay[w]> schinckel might have a clever way.  I've run out of ideas.
[08:34:02] <Safa_[A_Boy]> Yeah I know. I'm doing that now, and taking the first record in Python. But querying the db for 10000 posts (10 writers × 1000 posts) and loading into memory then discarding all of that doesn't seem efficient to me
[08:35:34] <PaulWay[w]> Yes, that's quite fair.

[18:43:26] <bananahead> Hey CodenameTim, thanks I was looking at {{ block.super }} but I didn't think it would work for my usecase. However thinking about it again, it just might. I will give it another try.

[18:44:25] <CodenameTim> bananahead: I think I understand what you're trying to do. You might need to adjust your use case to fit django's capabilities. Or define another block that wraps header_content and body_content, then set that in the child template.
[18:44:45] *** Joins: bionade24 (~bionade24@server2.oscloud.info)
[18:46:25] <bananahead> CodenameTim: Yeah. That is what I ultimately ended up doing, it just didnt feel right. In addition it mean I had to define a new block, and go back and refactor a number of templates.

[19:03:59] <theseb> Best open source tool to quickly make a web UI that looks great on desktops and mobile?
[19:06:17] <CodenameTim> theseb, if you're looking for a UI framework there's bootstrap which is pretty opinionated allowing for easier integration, and has been a major power in that market. I don't know if it's the best, but a lot of folks use it.
[19:10:11] <bananahead> Bulma is also a nice option.
[19:11:40] <theseb> thanks!
[19:11:51] <theseb> CodenameTim: does bootstrap work w/ django"
[19:11:53] <theseb> ?
[19:12:17] <theseb> isn't bootstrap just html/css skeletons that you add your content too?

[19:12:35] <theseb> Not saying that isn't useful.  Just trying to remember from last time i checked
[19:13:07] <bananahead> theseb: That's right. When you code your templates using html, you can use the classes that bootstrap gives you to create the layout.
[19:15:28] <theseb> ok awesome
[19:15:48] <CodenameTim> theseb: There's a number of options in the field. There's no clear front runner. Others to check are foundation and tailwind.

This is using the taggit library and I'm getting this when creating migrations: 'circuits.Provider.tags: (fields.E304) Reverse accessor for 'circuits.Provider.tags' clashes with reverse accessor for 'storage.Provider.tags'.'
