[21:39:46] <blkshp> Do they?

[21:39:53] <blkshp> :(
[21:40:13] <arryana> fortunately, it's enough of an allergy that my tongue burns and swells almost immediately, so it's hard to eat enough to hurt myself
[21:40:26] <arryana> but it also means i can't usually eat anything i didn't cook myself
[21:40:29] <blkshp> homemade fries are always better anyway but i see how that being the only option is irritating, is there nothing you can take to make it manageable?

[22:05:11] <arryana> uchi sushi, the snow crab rolls.
[22:05:14] <arryana> just... mm.
[22:05:59] <blkshp> anything with smoked salmon

[22:12:39] <pussipupu> arryana: excellent, bring British bacon and sausages
[22:12:47] <mnemon> yeah, can drive one prolly in most places with major motorsports enthusiasm though
[22:12:49] <arryana> haha, i'll see what i can do
[22:13:06] <pussipupu> blkshp: that's not a problem up be fair, Finnish blood sausage is very similar to black pudding

[22:16:16] <arryana> they all bring single use burners.
[22:17:38] <arryana> ideally you'd be right.  unfortunately, that scene attracts a particular sort of person.
[22:18:46] <mnemon> sure, it's still mostly security industry/white hat convention
