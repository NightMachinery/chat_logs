[12:17:44] <Isotopp> k_sze: to get the stored value of a field, use the hex() funcction
[12:17:53] <Isotopp> note that what you will see then is the value on disk,
[12:18:02] <Isotopp> the value on the wire may go through conversion

[12:25:39] <Isotopp> | รถ                       |
[12:25:59] <Isotopp> That is, I convert 0xf6 into a character of the latin1 charset, which happens to be o-umlaut.
[12:26:44] <Isotopp> this is then a string of the latin1 charset, being sent to my mac over a connection marked utf8 using "set names utf8". That will convert it to 0xc6 b6, the utf8 encoding of the 0xf6 codepoint, an o-umlaut in utf8
[12:27:01] <Isotopp> the client received 0xc3 b6, and renders this correctly as an o-umlaut.

[13:08:33] <lopid> we have replication of multiple databases from one mysql 5.5 server to one mariadb 10.7 server. unfortunately, there are too many writes to the source, and the replica, since it only executes one replicated statement at a time, is lagging behind increasingly. short of updating mysql 5.5 to take advantage of parallel replication, might there be something we're missing to speed it up?

[13:37:27] <Isotopp> No
[13:37:41] <Isotopp> MySQL 5.5 is hopelessly outdated, unsupported and known broken
[13:38:04] <Isotopp> it is also not capable of parallel replication like modern mysql (or maybe MariaDB, i have little experience)
[13:38:36] <Isotopp> I do know that replication from more modern mariadb to MySQL 5.7 is possible only with statement base replication (outdated) and only single threaded.
[13:39:17] <Isotopp> migrating away from mariadb and decommissioning the mariadb for a 120 TB database (don't ask) took around 3 months, also due to replication not catching up properly
[13:39:20] <Isotopp> recommendation:
[13:39:28] <Isotopp> - move to any modern version of mariadb or mysql
[13:39:38] <Isotopp> - make the replication hierarchy homogenous
[13:39:52] <Isotopp> - leverage parallel replication as offered by modern mysql
[13:40:41] <Isotopp> in mysql 8 that would be innodb, rbr, writeset parallel replication, and a sufficient number of applier threads.

[22:31:54] <lopid> you limited it further
[22:32:55] <VectorX> the text is aboyt 5/6 chars, so the key length of 10 is fine
[22:33:29] <lopid> if you remove the length then it'll be "Using index"
[22:36:07] <VectorX> sure buyt, I cant change the schema, so not sure how that would help
[22:39:42] <lopid> i don't know why, but that's the cause
[22:47:36] <Xgc> VectorX: That's because the index is not sufficient to process that logic.  It might even hurt performance.  That's up to the optimizer to decide.
[22:48:35] <Xgc> It doesn't know the actual data falls within the limited length of the index.
[22:51:26] <VectorX> is there a way I can tell it to use it, I need to group by the name and slug both actually
[22:53:14] <Xgc> VectorX: You can try with FORCE INDEX (index_name), but that's just a suggestion.
