[05:32:55] <Fade> sorry, waleee, I got called away. Changing the variable in the makefile didn't produce a binary that used the gtk renderer.
[05:33:04] <Fade> I'm just rerunning the build now.
[05:34:06] <Fade> the new build does use the gtk renderer, but it still crashes the same way.
[05:37:34] <Fade> but if I set WEBKIT_FORCE_SANDBOX successfully it does come up and work as expected.

[18:52:30] <mariari> the day when nyxt doesn't crash when I come back to it after hours of not using it would be a good day
[18:52:58] <mariari> it's always when I spawn a new buffer and do some ! search it just dies due to memory faults
[18:56:20] <mariari> as a revenge plot it decided to crash after sending this message again
[18:59:29] <mariari> is there any way that I can get useful feedback from the crashes of webkit, or way to supply the devs here with enough info to figure out why webkit crashes so often
[18:59:47] <mariari> since it takes the SBCL image, it's impossible for me to get any traces with it

[19:37:57] <jmercouris> mariari: so what Pierre recently added is a stack trace printer on errors
[19:38:08] <jmercouris> I think he set it up to print a complete trafe
[19:38:27] <jmercouris> I don’t know if this is on master or on the 2 series branch, I can’t remember
[19:38:36] <mariari> so even in a memory corruption where sbcl just dies
[19:38:40] <mariari> it'll trace it?
[19:52:07] <jmercouris> Well
[19:52:14] <jmercouris> I believe so
[19:52:20] <jmercouris> I can’t be certain though
[19:59:06] <mariari> that'd be great, we could see what logic is tripping up and causing webkit to kill sbcl and itslef
[19:59:30] <mariari> happens often so as soon as it's in mater I can pull and likely in a day i"ll have many traces
[20:09:18] <mariari> I think a very often crash is
[20:09:30] <mariari> I don't use nyxt for 10 minutes, then come back to it to open a new buffer to search something then it just dies
[20:10:01] <mariari> also don't press C-a in a minibuffer it freaks out the minibuffer
