[17:07:00] <Snuupy> xnaas: do you know if docker-swag support multiple domains and wildcards for those domains?
[17:07:16] <xnaas> Indeed it does.
[17:07:33] <Snuupy> ooo
[17:07:36] <Snuupy> ok I'll look into it
[17:07:44] <xnaas> You can see a lot in https://github.com/xnaas/nginx/blob/master/nginx/nginx.conf
[17:08:05] <Snuupy> thanks
[17:08:15] <Snuupy> what does the docker-compose.yml look like?
[17:08:32] <xnaas> also on github
[17:08:58] <Snuupy> ah there it is
[17:08:58] <xnaas> Though you won't see the environment variables there ðŸ˜…
[17:09:28] <Snuupy> ergh
[17:09:33] <xnaas> sec
[17:09:35] <Snuupy> I'm trying to figure out if it's supposed to look like this:
[17:09:39] <xnaas> only need to redact one piece of info :P
[17:09:49] <Snuupy>       - URL=yourdomain.url
[17:09:49] <Snuupy> -e EXTRA_DOMAINS=	
[17:10:18] <Snuupy> so the secondary domains for wildcards need to use asterisks "*" but the primary one uses "wildcard"
[17:10:22] <xnaas> https://gist.github.com/3e76cb6448c28014b39e1761342655c3
[17:10:25] <Snuupy> primary: Subdomains you'd like the cert to cover (comma separated, no spaces) ie. www,ftp,cloud. For a wildcard cert, set this exactly to wildcard (wildcard cert is available via dns and duckdns validation only)
[17:10:36] <Snuupy> extra domains: *.anotherdomain.org
[17:10:41] <Snuupy> how consistent of them >_>
[17:11:09] <xnaas> Well, you know, something gets done one way before and you're locked in forever for legacy support.
[17:11:10] <xnaas> :P
[17:11:17] <Snuupy> thanks
[17:11:21] <Snuupy> hahahaha oh I see
[17:11:32] <Snuupy> what if someone literally wanted
[17:11:38] <Snuupy> "wildcard.domain.com"
[17:11:47] <Snuupy> but not to implement a wildcard tls cert
[17:12:03] <xnaas> It would be nice to just have one 'domains' field where I could put xnaas.info, *.xnaas.info, actionsack.com, *.actionsack.com and be done with it ðŸ™ƒ
[17:12:10] <xnaas> but Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯
[17:12:10] <Snuupy> yeah exactly
[17:12:31] <Snuupy> then I need to figure out how to do this docker networking reverse proxy stuff
[17:13:11] <xnaas> very carefully 
[17:13:14] <xnaas> ðŸ¤ª
[17:13:28] <Snuupy> lol
[17:13:31] <xnaas> Basically, if something is in the same docker network, you can use the docker container name
[17:13:39] <xnaas> if it's not, you need to use host ip and port
[17:14:03] <xnaas> Anything in the default docker network cannot talk to each other
[17:14:25] <Snuupy> oh shit
[17:15:15] <Snuupy> I put everything in default network lmao
[17:15:22] <xnaas> ðŸ™ƒ
[17:15:31] <Snuupy> time to compose down and compose up -d a few times
[17:15:45] <xnaas> If you don't care about separation to the extent you see in my docker-compose.yml, you can just make one named network
[17:16:17] <Snuupy> I like having separation cus when I down I can down a single app
[17:16:22] <Snuupy> and not the entire thing
[17:16:34] <xnaas> oh, you have many different docker-compose files
[17:16:37] <xnaas> in that case yeah gl idk
[17:16:38] <xnaas> :P
[17:16:58] <Snuupy> lol
[17:17:00] <xnaas> I've never really needed docker-compose down. Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯
[17:17:08] <Snuupy> I need to restart nextcloud sometimes
[17:17:10] <Snuupy> kicking it helps
[17:17:41] <xnaas> I just set all my restart policies to unless-stopped and just docker stop name && docker rm name && docker-compose up -d basically :P
[17:17:58] <xnaas> if something is thatbroken
[17:18:08] <xnaas> most of the time a docker restart name is adequate
[17:18:31] <Snuupy> I can't find a keycloak image on lsio
[17:18:34] <Snuupy> boo
[17:19:33] <Snuupy> oh this would be useful https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-mods/tree/swag-ffmpeg
[17:19:48] <xnaas> that's just too much for me lol
[17:20:00] <xnaas> bare metal ffmpeg + tmux gets the job done ðŸ˜…
[17:20:44] <Snuupy> oh I thought it was nginx mod stream or something
[17:20:49] <Snuupy> nvm I just woke up don't mind me
[17:20:57] <Snuupy> this looks really nice too https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-mods/blob/swag-dashboard/.assets/example.png
[17:21:38] <xnaas> > This mod adds ffmpeg to swag, to be installed/updated during container start.
[17:21:44] <xnaas> that's...not helpful information at all
[17:21:45] <xnaas> lol
[17:21:49] <xnaas> adds it and does what?!
[17:22:00] <Snuupy> it just downloads it
[17:22:03] <Snuupy> like it tells you :P
[17:22:35] <xnaas> useless
[17:22:36] <xnaas> :P
[17:22:49] <Snuupy> ok I'll do this some other day, today is not that day
[17:22:58] <Snuupy> it's quite intricate
[17:23:07] <xnaas> I started fucking with that dashboard stuff once but found documentation for the pieces of it utterly useless.
[17:23:24] <Snuupy> I still have to figure out my gsuite migration plan
[17:23:29] <Snuupy> fucking google killing off standard plans
[17:23:37] <Snuupy> I'm looking at zoho
[17:23:58] <xnaas> I don't know how much data you back up, but for me the $20/mo I'm gonna have to pay now is still just stupid cheap for how much data I'm backing up. :P
[17:24:07] <Snuupy> I'm still on the $12/mo thing
[17:24:17] <Snuupy> the gsuite standard was free until may this year
[17:24:31] <xnaas> Same. It was $10/mo, then $12/mo, now you're gonna have to probably pay $20/mo for the "Enterprise" option.
[17:24:41] <xnaas> But I'm just waiting to see.
[17:24:44] <Snuupy> https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29996432
[17:24:45] <Snuupy> this one
[17:24:47] <xnaas> If I can save a few bucks, I definitely will.
[17:24:55] <Snuupy> yeah prob have to pay 20/mo
[17:25:07] <Snuupy> I'm not upgrading from 12/mo to 20/mo til they tell me to though
[17:25:09] <xnaas> yeah idk I never had free shit
[17:25:14] <xnaas> nor expect anything free to stay free :P
[17:25:23] <Snuupy> standard edition was just 15GB storage
[17:25:30] <Snuupy> many people used it to host email on custom domains
[17:25:33] * xnaas backs up more than 15TB :P
[17:25:40] <Snuupy> yes yes rape the gsuite
[17:25:52] <Snuupy> I'd do the same once I setup my htpc thing
[17:26:11] <xnaas> rclone and encrypted backups ftw
[17:26:22] <Snuupy> ikr :D
[17:26:26] <Snuupy> there's a 100k file limit on shared drives
[17:26:38] <Snuupy> you can combine them with union
[17:26:41] <Snuupy> and then crypt them all
[17:27:03] <xnaas> hmm, never needed a shared drive
[17:27:09] <Snuupy> "combine them" as in, you can combine multiple shared drives together and then union them together
[17:27:18] <xnaas> yeah, I figured
[17:27:19] <Snuupy> shared drives are nice because you can use service workers to access files
[17:27:25] <Snuupy> so you don't get API limited
[17:27:40] <xnaas> never been an issue for me, I guess Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯
[17:27:43] <Snuupy> https://www.uud.me/qiwenzalun/autorclone-gclone-win.html
[17:27:44] <Snuupy> https://github.com/donwa/gclone
[17:28:21] <xnaas> Even when I was restoring like 20TB from Google or whatever, the only real bottleneck was my gigabit WAN connection :P
[17:28:45] <Snuupy> hahahaha well there's that 750GB upload limit per day otherwise
[17:28:54] <xnaas> yeah, also not an issue :P
[17:28:59] <Snuupy> and each individual file has a 750GB limit
[17:29:10] <xnaas> I definitely don't add 750GB even over a weekend (I only do backups on weekdays)
[17:29:31] <xnaas> Gotta leave all that bandwidth open for Plex surges on the weekends ;P
[17:29:36] <Snuupy> lol
[17:29:44] <Snuupy> is your self-hosted setup at home?
[17:29:48] <xnaas> yes
[17:29:49] <Snuupy> no way it's cloud rented right
[17:29:51] <Snuupy> yeah
[17:29:53] <xnaas> fuck the cloud
[17:29:54] <xnaas> :P
[17:30:00] <Snuupy> I don't have an option to right now
[17:30:01] <Snuupy> I keep moving
[17:30:08] <xnaas> If I was home right now and not at work I would kick my server, physically.
[17:30:09] <xnaas> :P
[17:30:14] <Snuupy> have to cloud it, otherwise taking down my rpi every 3 months would be disruptive if people can't access their bitwardens
[17:31:03] <xnaas> Yeah, once I move I think it'll be a "go fuck yourself" to all my users, basically. I don't think I'll be able to afford anywhere with gigabit ever at this point lol
[17:31:13] <Snuupy> lol
[17:31:19] <Snuupy> why not?
[17:31:21] <xnaas> (right now I pay very cheap rent to live at home)
[17:31:28] <xnaas> because fucking everything is fucked in the US
[17:31:30] <Snuupy> tech jobs pay 6 figures
[17:31:31] <xnaas> especially housing costs
[17:31:40] <Snuupy> I mean, I broke it down this way:
[17:31:48] <Snuupy> 150-200k/year softeng in SEA/SFO
[17:31:53] <Snuupy> housing is 40-50k/year
[17:31:56] <Snuupy> taxes is 50k/year
[17:32:15] <Snuupy> food/misc is like 10-20k/year
[17:32:17] * xnaas takes a moment to parse SEA/SFO
[17:32:21] <Snuupy> seattle/san francisco
[17:32:27] <Snuupy> if you aren't there in tech ofc $ is tigheter
[17:32:28] * xnaas got there eventually
[17:32:29] <Snuupy> tighter
[17:32:35] <Snuupy> airport codes lol
[17:32:36] * xnaas isn't moving to the west coast
[17:32:43] <Snuupy> I'm doing it for the $
[17:32:46] <xnaas> Google has tried to get me to move to Cali so many fucking times
[17:32:47] <Snuupy> canada pays shit
[17:32:49] <xnaas> fuck off, Google
[17:32:50] <Snuupy> hahahahaha
[17:33:24] <Snuupy> I was going to say, I'm sure plenty of tech companies would want you
[17:33:47] <Snuupy> so money shouldn't be a problem if you don't mind selling your soul
[17:34:02] <xnaas> Facebook tried to lure me in once too
[17:34:04] <xnaas> but here in Austin
[17:34:12] <xnaas> Couldn't do it. ðŸ˜¬
[17:34:22] <Snuupy> texas is too hot for me unfortunately
[17:34:34] <xnaas> Like, I hate myself and want to die, sure, but I don't want to suffer more. :P
[17:34:37] <Snuupy> lol
[17:34:55] <Snuupy> why yes helping the spread of misinformation is my dream jerb!
[17:34:58] <xnaas> I'm a ðŸ¦Ž. I live for the heat.
[17:35:02] <Snuupy> they have some cool tech though
[17:35:10] <xnaas> Unfortunately, everywhere warm seems to be fucked.
[17:35:25] <xnaas> So I've been looking at jobs in the northeast...
[17:35:26] <xnaas> :/
[17:35:29] <Snuupy> eugh
[17:35:32] <Snuupy> snow
[17:35:35] <xnaas> I fucking despise snow with every piece of my soul.
[17:35:37] <xnaas> but
[17:35:40] <Snuupy> I grew up in toronto
[17:35:43] <xnaas> apparently the sane people all live there only
[17:35:45] <xnaas> ðŸ˜©
[17:35:46] <Snuupy> -30C is common in the winter
[17:35:59] <Snuupy> I really liked Raleigh, NC when I visited there
[17:36:07] <Snuupy> people there were relatively sane but wages weren't as high 
[17:36:19] <xnaas> A few Canadians have tried to lure me to Vancouver...while also complaining about the overpriced bullshit housing there too... ðŸ˜¬
[17:36:28] <Snuupy> I'm currently in vancouver!
[17:36:33] <xnaas> poor bastard
[17:36:35] <Snuupy> yep housing here is retarded
[17:36:35] <xnaas> ðŸ¤ª
[17:36:37] <Snuupy> hahaha
[17:36:40] <Snuupy> weather is better here
[17:36:58] <Snuupy> you know the housing here is fucked because canada doesn't do much to deter foreign investors
[17:37:00] <xnaas> the other thing I'd have to adjust to moving north...is way, way less daylight in the winter
[17:37:03] <Snuupy> so all the foreign investors buy up domestic property
[17:37:04] <Snuupy> it's fucked
[17:37:13] <Snuupy> nooooo sunlight is so nice
[17:37:24] <Snuupy> those artificial SAD lamps don't begin to make up for not having proper real sunlight
[17:37:25] <xnaas> I love my ðŸŒž and my ðŸ”¥ (heat) :P
[17:38:36] <xnaas> But I'll adjust, I suppose.
[17:38:57] <xnaas> I can't afford to live (alone) in Austin and the entire state of Texas is fucked, so.
[17:38:58] <xnaas> Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯
[17:39:05] <Snuupy> why not?
[17:39:16] <Snuupy> austin jerbs payscale is right after SEA/SFO
[17:39:21] <Snuupy> er
[17:39:23] <Snuupy> NY is actually
[17:39:25] <Snuupy> then austin no?
[17:39:27] <xnaas> Because I can't afford to pay fucking $10k over asking in cash
[17:39:30] <xnaas> fucking Californians, man
[17:39:33] <Snuupy> lmao
[17:39:36] <Snuupy> mortgage?
[17:39:43] <xnaas> I fucking hate every god damn cunt from that state :D
[17:40:06] <Snuupy> lol can't blame you
[17:40:35] <xnaas> Anyway, even if I could afford to live here still, it's still not the Austin I grew up in, ya know. :/
[17:41:16] <Snuupy> ah
[17:41:58] <xnaas> It was already becoming very "corpo" when I was growing up and it's gotten exponentially worse in the last decade ðŸ˜¬
[17:42:13] <Snuupy> I didn't know any different when I grew up
[17:42:20] <Snuupy> I don't feel warm feelings towards how it was back then
[17:43:12] <xnaas> Plus with almost no natives left (literally everyone I talk to is from fucking California), I'm now the outcast
[17:43:13] <xnaas> :/
[17:43:29] <Snuupy> oh move away from city center maybe?
[17:43:44] <xnaas> Also the kind of person that chooses to move to Texas from Cali is apparently a total jackass
[17:43:48] <Snuupy> lol
[17:43:50] <xnaas> all rude, self-centered assholes
[17:44:22] <Snuupy> I can see why you'd say that
[17:44:31] <xnaas> Right now I live so far out the land we live on now was a different town until Austin annexed it when our neighborhood was being built (we were the first house out here)
[17:44:32] <xnaas> :P
[17:44:40] <Snuupy> o
[17:45:46] <xnaas> Anyway, it's always nice to meet a rare native Austinite like myself. Can always tell immediately because they're not an asshole from the first word out of their mouth. :D
[17:46:37] <xnaas> All the smart Austinites left in the late 90s/early 2000s. :P
[17:46:53] <Snuupy> well you're always helpful so I 'preciate it
[17:47:03] <Snuupy> lmao
[17:47:04] <xnaas> always is a powerful word!
[17:47:05] <xnaas> ðŸ¤ª
[17:47:30] <xnaas> but yeah, I try â€“ I want anyone who pursues a path after me to suffer less than I did, ya know?
[17:47:42] <xnaas> Apparently a rare mindset these days... :/
[17:47:48] <Snuupy> yeah it's crazy
[17:47:58] <Snuupy> most canadians are passive aggressive as fuck
[17:48:05] <Snuupy> they love to crab bucket mentality
[17:48:09] <Snuupy> it's so toxic
[17:48:11] <xnaas> heh
[17:48:11] <xnaas> rip
[17:48:17] <Snuupy> get me outta hereeeeeee
[17:48:36] <xnaas> You'll welcome to open cuntiness of Californians, then. ðŸ¤ª
[17:48:41] <Snuupy> I mean west coast self-centered-ness I'm prepared for
[17:48:48] * xnaas really slaughtered his English there
[17:48:48] <Snuupy> no I worked in SFO
[17:48:49] <xnaas> jesus
[17:48:50] <Snuupy> never again
[17:48:58] <Snuupy> toxic as fuck
[17:49:01] <xnaas> heh
[17:49:45] <xnaas> tbh, I think my dream job, as weird as that makes me, is to be like the only IT guy for an entire small town or county or something
[17:49:55] <xnaas> get to know everyone real well
[17:49:58] <xnaas> real slow paced
[17:49:58] <Snuupy> no I can see where that comes from
[17:50:06] <Snuupy> no bullshit new framework every week
[17:50:20] <Snuupy> not everyone else is in tech so you're valued cus if you don't do it, no one will
[17:50:27] <xnaas> ^
[17:50:32] <Snuupy> when your neighbor is in tech and your entire building is in tech and the entire company is tech
[17:50:36] <Snuupy> you're not special
[17:50:42] <Snuupy> replacable
[17:50:46] <Snuupy> disposable
[17:50:49] <xnaas> Being needed/wanted is nice.
[17:50:55] <Snuupy> but the $$$$$
[17:51:03] <Snuupy> hard to turn it down lmao
[17:51:06] <xnaas> Feeling like you actually serve a legitimate purpose for dozens of people ðŸ˜­
[17:52:07] <xnaas> I don't mind making pennies, as long as I can actually afford to fuckin' live somewhere
[17:52:08] <xnaas> like jesus

[17:52:40] <Snuupy> I mean I'm sure there are jerbs that pay well AND don't require you to be a mercenary
[17:52:53] <Snuupy> things like EFF/Signal/<open source co here>
[17:53:07] <Snuupy> mozilla, heh
[17:53:35] <xnaas> rip Mozilla
[17:53:46] <Snuupy> yup
[17:53:58] <xnaas> I really wish someone else could take the reigns on Firefox :(
[17:54:11] <xnaas> I don't know who really could other than the Linux Foundation but Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯
[17:54:41] <Snuupy> I was trying to come up with something but I'm not sure
[17:55:19] <xnaas> Ever day I'm waiting to open my feed reader or Reddit and see "Mozilla finally gives up and now Google owns Firefox" or some shit.
[17:55:30] <xnaas> and the web will finally be over
[17:55:32] <xnaas> ðŸ™ƒ
[17:55:35] <Snuupy> rip
[17:56:28] * xnaas says, as he keeps using thelounge, which relies on T H E  W E B
[17:56:29] <xnaas> :P
[17:56:39] <Snuupy> yeah but the open web
[17:56:51] <xnaas> onion-only thelounge when /s
[17:57:49] <xnaas> Every time I use Tor to test something, I'm reminded how grateful I am that I live in a country where I don't have to...
[17:58:14] <xnaas> (it's so damn slow)
[17:58:30] <Snuupy> what you don't like solving 69 captchas to do something?
[17:58:48] <Snuupy> my life goal when I grew up was to sit at my desk and solve captchas!
[18:00:08] <xnaas> heh
[18:00:19] <xnaas> Not even the captchas, just everything is so god damn slow
[18:00:27] <xnaas> feels like I'm on fuckin' dial-up
[18:00:43] * xnaas is exaggerating only slightly
[18:00:43] <xnaas> :P
[18:01:51] <Snuupy> I hope framework laptop doesn't die
[18:03:21] <xnaas> I'd love to get one as soon as they offer a touchscreen, because I'd like to support them
[18:03:54] <xnaas> Replaceable parts are definitely important to me.
[18:04:27] <Snuupy> I'd like to not have to buy lelnono ever again
[18:04:48] <Snuupy> I need a laptop with screen/cpu options though
[18:04:56] <xnaas> I haven't ever bought one personally and don't plan on it.
[18:04:58] <xnaas> Fuck Lenovo.
[18:04:58] <xnaas> :P
[18:05:05] <Snuupy> thonkpads
[18:05:15] <xnaas> Supporting them at all in the Enterprise space taught me that they're all complete pieces of shit
[18:05:19] <xnaas> it's not just bad batches
[18:05:20] <Snuupy> they all are
[18:05:21] <xnaas> they're all fucking bad
[18:05:27] <Snuupy> lelnono, dhell, hp
[18:05:34] <Snuupy> I haven't found a single good corporate vendor
[18:05:59] <xnaas> My experience with Dell has been mostly solid. The few times we've gotten bad batches, they resolved shit quickly and without BS.
[18:06:05] <xnaas> Might help that they're "local" basically.
[18:06:07] <xnaas> Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯
[18:07:06] <Snuupy> I refuse to dell
[18:10:08] <xnaas> For a personal laptop...nothing has been worth buying to me, ever.
[18:10:20] <xnaas> The only laptop I have I got for free because it was going to be recycled at work. :P
[18:12:32] <Snuupy> I keep waiting and waiting for a cm4 NAS carrier board
[18:12:36] <xnaas> It's a mid-2012 MBPr that...clearly has suffered a lot of damage from heat over the years lol
[18:12:45] <Snuupy> but it's all vaporware during chip shortage
[18:12:49] <Snuupy> lol
[18:13:03] <Snuupy> the new macbooks are garbage
[18:13:09] <xnaas> man, I want to move from my server + NAS setup into an all-in-one kinda thing, but everything is fucked on supply and price
[18:13:28] <Snuupy> yeah the server should be the nas for home unless there's something special
[18:13:35] <xnaas> Removing networking from the equation would save me a lot of headaches. :P
[18:14:08] <xnaas> gigabit is just...too slow :P
[18:14:28] <xnaas> and upgrading past that is just $$ I don't want to spend b/c I'm a cheap bastard :D
[18:14:40] <Snuupy> I like that tb3 has 10gbit networking
[18:15:43] <xnaas> https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06Y4N5PCX/ my NAS definitely doesn't support Thunderbolt ðŸ˜œ
[18:17:17] <Snuupy> I don't want to drop $ on a propritary synology
[18:17:27] <Snuupy> I'd rather build my own at this point \=
[18:17:51] <xnaas> That's what I want to do, but supply and pricing right now... :/
[18:18:10] <xnaas> All the pieces I want range from "out of stock" to "triple MSRP" lol
[18:21:13] <Snuupy> except SSDs!
[18:22:19] <xnaas> The only thing I don't need!
[18:22:21] <xnaas> ðŸ˜©
[18:22:22] <Snuupy> hahahaha
[18:23:08] <xnaas> I mean, I suppose a new one couldn't hurt
[18:23:16] <xnaas> all mine are pretty old and have a lot of writes
[18:23:19] <xnaas> but they work so :P
[18:33:11] *** eliocamp3 is now known as eliocamp
[18:33:21] <xnaas> https://gist.github.com/177ebf8575d934826c4fca9019507071
[18:33:39] <xnaas> I love that every stat is old age or pre-fail
[18:33:40] <xnaas> lol
[18:33:59] <Snuupy>   5 Reallocated_Sector_Ct   0x0033   100   100   010    Pre-fail  Always       -       0
[18:33:59] <Snuupy> oh no lol
[18:34:11] <Snuupy> swap the disks!
[18:36:00] <xnaas> well, since they're SSDs, I think Wear_Leveling_Count is probably more relevant
[18:36:09] <xnaas> fuck knows what the numbers mean tho
[18:36:10] <xnaas> :P
[18:36:20] <Snuupy> things are failing is what it means lol
[18:39:51] <xnaas> https://superuser.com/a/1037650
[18:40:18] <xnaas> so 95% life left on one SSD and 74% left on the other
[18:40:20] <xnaas> more or less
[18:40:39] <xnaas> I'm not positive, but I'm pretty sure the one with less life left, sdb, is my boot drive. :P
[18:41:41] <xnaas> yup
[18:41:56] <xnaas> it's fine
[18:42:05] <xnaas> obviously will just use it until it stops booting ;P
[18:44:15] <xnaas> The only data on the drive that matters is my docker data and that's backup up to the other one so Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯
[18:44:23] <xnaas> s/backup/backed
[18:51:18] <Snuupy> what are you using to backup data?
[18:51:23] <Snuupy> I've been looking into kopia
[18:51:35] <Snuupy> I wonder if there's a way to do system image backups but incrementally
[18:51:42] <Snuupy> a lot of the tools are like, you have to specify a folder
[18:51:55] <Snuupy> do you just specify / as the backup target?
[18:52:55] <xnaas> For the case of backuping up one drive to the other in the same system, rsync is fine
[18:53:56] <xnaas> In my crontab: @daily /usr/bin/rsync -avh --delete --exclude=.snapshots/* /home/xnaas /media/data/ Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯
[18:57:55] <bookworm> btrfs has snapshots so that you only send the diff rather than everything and you're way faster than rsync as you can calculate the diff locally
[18:58:27] <Snuupy> ah
[18:58:30] <bookworm> zfs has the same features, but I'm not gonna run an out of tree fs. I'm not that insane
[19:00:39] <Snuupy> first snapshot on another disk will be a complete image, right?
[19:00:48] <Snuupy> first snapshot backing up to another disk*
[19:01:07] <bookworm> sure
[19:01:23] <Snuupy> will look into it, thanks
[19:01:38] <bookworm> but for that src and dst need to be btrfs
[19:02:00] <Snuupy> I'm tempted to convert all my fs to btrfs
[19:02:04] <Snuupy> except windows boxes obv
[19:02:35] <bookworm> also it's on the fs block level, which works rather poorly for some things like databases so you need some additional scripting
[19:02:57] <bookworm> but rsync has a similar problem with dbs, worse actually
[19:03:27] <bookworm> as you can happily corrupt the db data whereas with btrfs it's in a sane state, just inefficient
[19:04:29] <Snuupy> thanks
[19:04:59] <xnaas> the drive my boot drive backs up to is btrfs and I have snapshots going on it
[19:05:05] <xnaas> but my boot drive is ext4 :P
[19:05:17] <bookworm> any particular reason?
[19:06:06] <xnaas> When I imaged this...jeez...5 or 6 years ago? longer? was definitely not a priority to fuck with anything outside of ext4 lol
[19:06:14] <bookworm> ^^
[19:07:14] <xnaas> ah, this iteration was ~4 years ago, actually
[19:07:15] <xnaas> still
[19:08:36] <xnaas> The NAS is...special, though.
[19:08:48] <xnaas> If you want to know too much: https://daltondur.st/syno_btrfs_1/
[19:09:20] <xnaas> BTRFS on top of ext4...basically.
[19:10:56] <bookworm> I'd still advise against raid5
[19:11:19] <xnaas> I went from 8x8TB RAID10 to 8x16TB SHR2 (RAID6 equivalent)
[19:11:38] <xnaas> I miss the speed of the RAID10 sometimes...but damn does giving up half your drives suck lol
[19:12:23] <xnaas> Realistically, since I bought all the drives at once, I might as well have gone RAID0 ;P
[19:13:04] <xnaas> If one drive goes, the rest are probably about to follow any way; but that's what cloud backups are for. Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯
[19:18:57] <xnaas> When I do finally move into having everything in one box, the plan is to go all-in on ZFS, probably.
[19:19:03] <Snuupy> have you used btrfs on root partition of raspberry pis, bookworm?
[19:20:00] <xnaas> Maybe by the time I can build a new box ZFS will finally have merged those patches to add drives to an existing vdev or whatever the fuck they call their groups of drives.
[19:20:07] <Snuupy> some people are saying I have to mess with initramfs but that might be outdated? this blog posts doesn't list anything about initramfs at all https://ferrario.me/ubuntu-on-the-raspberry-pi-part-i-installing-ubuntu-20.04-with-btrfs-on-root/#fnref:2
[19:21:40] <bookworm> I don't do rpis very much, have a few lying around but none are live. I do run btrfs on 3 servers and my laptop as a rootfs though.
[19:22:31] <Snuupy> oh boy okay I should try this on a non-"prod" device then
[19:25:17] <xnaas> BTRFS is pretty cool overall. You get the advantages of ZFS but with flexibility and a little bit of "well there's some issues with RAID" :P
[19:25:43] <bookworm> why do you think it's a problem? btrfs is in core the only thing you might want to do is add the btrfs userspace utilities to the initramfs so that you can troubleshoot if things go south
[19:25:58] <bookworm> only with raid5
[19:26:05] <bookworm> raid1 works just fine
[19:26:06] <Snuupy> I'm not familiar with initramfs at all
[19:26:10] <Snuupy> I'll have to break it and play with it
[19:26:20] <Snuupy> if I break it I don't want to be unable to turn off my lights :P
[19:26:23] <bookworm> it's not an issue with raid, it's an issue with specific raid modes
[19:27:42] <xnaas> I have a buddy who's been using RAID5 or 6 with his BTRFS setup for years now and hasn't had any issues yet (that weren't his own fault).
[19:28:06] <xnaas> It's probably time for some of that info to be re-evaluated. :P
[19:28:20] <xnaas> plus, who cares if your RAID setup sucks; you should have backups anyway :D
[19:28:32] <bookworm> that's quite literally an information from upstream
[19:28:48] <xnaas> That hasn't been updated in like a million years.
[19:29:30] <bookworm> what I'm looking forward to is transparent encryption... that zfs has going for it over btrfs
[19:29:43] <bookworm> btrfs has compression, but no encryption
[19:30:33] <bookworm> zfs on the other hand tends to break on new kernel releases which is an absolute no go considering my distro
[19:34:25] <xnaas> My mistake on a million years (obvious hyperbole). From an article in September 2021: https://xnaas.info/tmp/YzV.webp
[19:35:45] <xnaas> said article: https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/09/examining-btrfs-linuxs-perpetually-half-finished-filesystem/
[19:40:53] <bookworm> rather opinionated
[19:41:05] <xnaas> indeed
[19:41:26] <xnaas> Was really only pulling it up for the note about SUSE merging the comments as recently as March 2021 :P
[19:41:26] <bookworm> Number of times I've seen zfs go south due to kernel: 2. Btrfs: 0
[19:42:23] <bookworm> I mean btrfs is the default on suse and fedora, can't be that bad
[19:42:45] <xnaas> As long as it's not RAID5/6, seems fine, yeah.
[19:42:58] <bookworm> yes, the degraded mount is a tad interesting, then again I wanna know if one of my disc crashed rather than continuing on one leg
[19:43:04] <xnaas> Though aforementioned buddy will say endlessly that RAID5/6 are fine too, since he hasn't had any issues, but Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯
[19:43:12] <bookworm> not booting is a very good way to get my attention ;)
[19:44:06] <xnaas> then there's the extreme: if my RAID array is degraded in my NAS the beeping is...very, very loud lol
[19:44:25] <xnaas> scared the Hell out of me the one and only time it ever happened
[19:44:52] <bookworm> I don't like the hardware raid or synology stuff... I'm always worried that it messes up as you have no control over it
[19:45:32] <Snuupy> I ran ceph on my raspberry pi
[19:45:38] <bookworm> I have a qnap extension bay as my NAS enclosure but I'm definitely not using hardware raid that's on some proprietary microchip
[19:45:44] <Snuupy> call me crazy but https://i.imgur.com/aCrlurs.jpg
[19:45:58] <Snuupy> benchmarks https://pastebin.com/teTCgQ80
[19:46:36] <xnaas> I prefer the "all mircosd cards" RAID array
[19:46:44] <Snuupy> lmao
[19:46:53] <bookworm> your performance must be shit as you are a using usb in the wrong version as well as a rpi which has a garbage bus that's horrible over USB
[19:47:22] <bookworm> at least iirc from the stuff I read about it
[19:47:25] <Snuupy> 216MB/s rand read is fine
[19:48:17] <Snuupy> only 65MB/s write but whatever wifi6 can't do much higher than 500mbps anyway
[19:48:38] <Snuupy> err that's def the usb3 port
[19:48:55] <Snuupy> rpi4 can do 5gbps through that bus now, no longer shared with ethernet port
[19:49:05] <Snuupy> rpi3 and older yes it would be absolute garbage perf
[19:49:13] <bookworm> ah, they fixed it
[19:49:20] <Snuupy> yeah only reason I bought it
[19:49:27] <Snuupy> 100mbps shared between usb bus AND ethernet? god damn
[19:49:32] <Snuupy> well not 100 but something close to that
[19:49:46] <bookworm> didn't the 4th gen had a similar hardware defekt from the get go?
[19:49:54] <Snuupy> it had a usb-c PD fiasco
[19:50:00] <Snuupy> luckily I waited til they fixed it to buy it
[19:50:02] * Snuupy got lucky
[19:50:24] <bookworm> assuming they didn't give you a unit from some intermediate storage ;P
[19:50:41] <Snuupy> yeah you can verify the revisions on the boards
[19:50:51] <Snuupy> annoying but still cost effective
[19:51:36] <xnaas> My Pi4 only sits around to run AdGuard Home ðŸ˜¬
[19:51:53] <Snuupy> lol
[19:52:03] <Snuupy> I run homeassistant and smb share
[19:52:27] <xnaas> The Pi could probably run everything I run except for Plex, but meh
[19:52:33] <bookworm> dns level AdBlock is on my router
[19:52:38] <Snuupy> I bet it could do plex too
[19:52:42] <Snuupy> it even hw transcodes
[19:52:46] <bookworm> no need for an external device
[19:52:49] <xnaas> It absolutely cannot handle 8 transcodes lol
[19:52:53] <Snuupy> not 8
[19:52:53] <Snuupy> maybe 1
[19:52:55] <Snuupy> lo
[19:52:59] <Snuupy> the little pi that could :D
[19:53:15] <xnaas> If I only used Plex myself and guaranteed direct play, then sure
[19:53:18] <xnaas> alas
[19:53:32] <Snuupy> I only do direct play, when do you transcode?
[19:53:45] <xnaas> Me? Only when I'm watching TV in the Tesla at lunch
[19:53:52] <xnaas> My users? All the god damn time
[19:53:53] <xnaas> :P
[19:54:02] <Snuupy> lmao wtf are your users transcoding
[19:54:34] <Snuupy> like which formats
[19:54:44] <xnaas> The more tech savvy folks are able to change Plex's horrible defaults from 2Mbps or 4Mbps 720p to Original Quality every time Plex fuckin' changes your settings
[19:54:48] <xnaas> but the other people...oof
[19:54:58] <xnaas> getting them to change it once was a lot of work, you give up after a while
[19:55:32] <Snuupy> you don't want to just disable transcoding globally huh
[19:55:41] <xnaas> With the hardware transcoder on the i5 though, I care less. It makes their stream looks shittier than software transcoding, so I'm glad they're suffering! :P
[19:56:14] <xnaas> If I disabled it globally, I'd be unable to watch most content in my car
[19:56:19] <xnaas> LTE signal isn't great at work
[19:56:26] <Snuupy> I think they don't even know that they're watching at 240p
[19:56:39] <xnaas> the older folks definitely can't tell the difference
[19:56:42] <xnaas> "yeah, it looks great1'
[19:56:45] <xnaas> but I know it doesn't
[19:56:46] <xnaas> :/
[19:56:47] <Snuupy> ...lol
[19:56:57] <xnaas> but hey
[19:57:00] <xnaas> if they're happy Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯
[19:58:04] <xnaas> Almost all of my users I know have the bandwidth too, it's not a matter of shit internet.
[19:58:14] <xnaas> It's just Plex's awful, awful defaults.
[19:58:15] <xnaas> :(
[19:59:01] <Snuupy> iono if jellyfin is any better
[19:59:17] <xnaas> The problem with Jellyfin (and even Emby) is clients, basically.
[19:59:20] <xnaas> Plex is on everything.
[19:59:31] <xnaas> Every. Thing.
[19:59:33] <xnaas> ðŸ˜±
[20:02:58] <xnaas> The eventual plan is to migrate someday, though.
[20:03:06] <xnaas> Plex isn't FOSS, so it's inherently bad. ;P
[20:03:24] <Snuupy> I'm not even going to start with plex
[20:03:31] <Snuupy> if jellyfin isn't supported on x then so be it
[20:03:39] <Snuupy> I just wonder if jellyfin for android tv has speed controls
[20:05:12] <Snuupy> https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin-androidtv/commit/17ba4828a7e18fb0c96e0c6be0f2d6d80c7b4a77 looks like it
[20:05:32] <xnaas> Just download TV releases; they're pre-sped up!
[20:06:32] <Snuupy> I like to watch stuff at 1.75x
[20:35:34] <bookworm> nothing like having every actor sound like a smurf ðŸ˜›
[20:58:32] <xnaas> Yeah, I watch media to enjoy it, not to get through it as fast as possible. ðŸ˜…
[22:44:11] *** Joins: mcint (mcint@user/mcint)
[22:55:48] <Activ8> Someone made a post on reddit asking how to backup 90TB of plex data lol I was like wtf.
[22:55:54] <Activ8> All that data and no backup plan
[22:56:43] <xnaas> In fairness, movies, TV, etc. are all easily replaceable 
[22:57:05] <Activ8> they are but for how long
[23:01:02] <bookworm> backing up 90TB is not going to be cheap in the cloud
[23:01:23] <bookworm> you can maybe put it on glazier for a reasonable price, but to get the data back out you'll need to sell your soul
[23:01:42] <xnaas> It's cheap from Google.
[23:01:52] <xnaas> $20/mo for 90TB really isn't the worst deal ever.
[23:02:11] <xnaas> Could make it $20/mo for a petabyte if you're a jackass! :P
[23:02:47] <bookworm> considering that data volumes in that range would cost... (/me checks hetzner) roughly ~4870 Euro
[23:02:55] <bookworm> per month
[23:02:58] <xnaas> ouch
[23:03:14] <xnaas> Just store it encrypted and leverage Google's generosity until it's taken away
[23:03:14] <xnaas> ez
[23:03:15] <xnaas> :P
[23:03:27] <xnaas> That plan's been working for me for years!
[23:03:45] <xnaas> Of course, when I started it was only $10/mo. Later went up to $12/mo. Now it looks like they're gonna ask for $20/mo. ðŸ˜¬
[23:03:49] <xnaas> still insanely cheap
[23:05:53] <xnaas> (I have about 30TB backed up at the moment.)
[23:08:37] <Activ8> you would be best with a 10Gbe link from removeable storage and keeping a copy offsite somewhere lol
[23:08:45] <Activ8> that's nuts that is lol
[23:08:47] <bookworm> hm, getting the data out won't be though... google pricing calculator tells me I'd have to pay 3700 $ to get 90TB back out
[23:09:00] <Activ8> ouch!
[23:09:17] <bookworm> which is fine for a failsafe happens once plan, but something to keep in mind
[23:09:26] <xnaas> You're looking at the wrong thing.
[23:09:32] <bookworm> maybe
[23:09:43] <xnaas> I've pulled 24TB down for $0 additional cost. :P
[23:10:05] <bookworm> then what counts as Egress in google speak for a standard storage?
[23:10:17] <bookworm> that's straight out of their pricing calculator: https://cloud.google.com/products/calculator#id=
[23:10:19] <xnaas> They're renaming, G Suite to Workspaces or some shit, but I'm not talking about GCE. :P
[23:10:25] <xnaas> Stop looking at GCE. :D
[23:11:02] <bookworm> ah, you shove everything on gdrive?
[23:11:35] <xnaas> Essentially.
[23:11:37] <xnaas> god bless rclone
[23:11:46] <xnaas> Without rclone, it would be a nightmare, I'm sure.
[23:11:52] <bookworm> via a fuse driver? Or how do you talk to them?
[23:12:04] <xnaas> https://github.com/rclone/rclone/
[23:12:32] <xnaas> (One of the several FOSS projects I donate to monthly/yearly.)
[23:14:18] <bookworm> how do you get 30TB for 12 bucks a month for gdrive?
[23:14:33] <xnaas> The only limits are that you can only upload 750GB/day (so an initial upload can take quite some time) and 10TB/day down.
[23:14:50] <bookworm> "business plus" is 18$/month and only gives you 5TB
[23:14:59] <bookworm> https://workspace.google.com/pricing.html
[23:15:19] <xnaas> The old G Suite standard plan was $12/mo (and $10/mo before that) for 1TB/user, but it's never been enforced.
[23:15:27] <xnaas> But now you'll probably have to do Enterprise for $20/mo
[23:15:39] <xnaas> data from other people doing the same is kinda mixed at the moment
[23:15:46] <xnaas> so I can't give a more definitive answer yet
[23:16:10] <xnaas> In theory Google will forcefully transition my account this month or next :P
[23:16:36] <Activ8> I certainly don't believe shifting that amount of data for home users that's just nuts
[23:17:25] <Activ8> I keep my stuff under 500gb and it's split.  Very important data is on a cloud share externally, not important on two ext hdds.  very Important data only comes to about 25gb so far
[23:25:15] <xnaas> Unrelated: Has anyone fucked with Rocky or Alma Linuxes?
[23:27:38] <bookworm> I'm not much of a distro hopper nowdays, I'm happy with mine
[23:28:03] <bookworm> and the more I learn about debian the happier I am with *not* running debian or a derivative
[23:28:27] <bookworm> last talk was https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qs6zGDZNvZw
[23:29:01] <xnaas> Alternatively: I've been very happy with Debian my whole life :P
[23:29:22] <xnaas> But I am passively interested in checking out other things.
[23:29:38] <bookworm> there's only one version and that's the latest
[23:29:45] <bookworm> I'm not fond of 10 year old bugs
[23:29:57] <xnaas> they're my favorite
[23:29:59] <xnaas> ðŸ¤ª
[23:30:00] <bookworm> tried that, banged my head at a wall sooo many times.
[23:30:34] <bookworm> tmux had fixed a whole bunch of issues, and ubuntu didn't feel the need to give it to me. And tmux is an effing leaf application that's not depended upon
[23:31:02] <bookworm> so yeah, stable distros is something I make a huge detour around
[23:31:16] <bookworm> I have to use CentOS where I work, that's even worse
[23:31:25] <xnaas> lol https://twitter.com/ChrisLAS/status/1460668344156114944
[23:31:35] <bookworm> first order of business was recompiling basically every single tmux dep from scratch to even get a sane shell
[23:32:04] <Activ8> only hannah montana linux xnaas
[23:32:10] <xnaas> fair Activ8
[23:32:12] <xnaas> ðŸ¤ª
[23:32:15] <Activ8> ha ha ha
[23:32:30] <Activ8> I'm fairly sure that's what bookworm codes on
[23:32:39] <bookworm> naturally
[23:32:46] <bookworm> but only when I'm not using suicide linux
[23:32:48] <Activ8> bosh! I knew it!
[23:33:12] <bookworm> (suicide deletes a random file on disc whenever a tool exits with non zero exit status)
[23:33:48] <Activ8> is that classed as suicide coding, built for the hard core of coders who never make mistakes
[23:36:07] <xnaas> oh no
[23:36:14] <xnaas> I'd delete half my install in a day
[23:36:15] <xnaas> :P
[23:44:44] <Activ8> If I did it I would have no code left
[23:48:33] <Activ8> github for the lounge been super quiet since 4.3 release
