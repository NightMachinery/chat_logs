[00:36:22] <goldmund> on a positive note, I just upgraded my site to gatsby 4 since paulcarroty posted. it's rare that a community is this on-the-ball
[00:36:23] <ashnur> no, because most of the time you want to write the url, not read from it

[04:06:03] <FlorianBad> When I do `const sp = p.specs || o.specs || {};` I sometimes get sp undefined, probably because it exists but is undefined... Is there a clean way of falling back to {} in a single line so I don't have to turn it into a var and then put an `if( !sp ) sp = {};`
[04:09:08] <parv> FlorianBad, Do you mean in cases when "sp" exists, then "const sp .. {}" has no effect?
[04:09:35] <FlorianBad> no
[04:10:13] <FlorianBad> if p.specs exists AND is defined it takes that. If not, same thing for o.specs, and if not then it's {}
[04:11:29] <FlorianBad> Me using ||  doesn't seem to work because it will pick p.specs even if it is undefined or false, or something silly, simply because it exists
[04:12:06] <parv> FlorianBad, Ok. That makes your issue much clearer.
[04:12:14] <FlorianBad> silly: looks like a really annoying nickname you picked ;)

[04:18:09] <FlorianBad> sickdyd: I need to test but I think that on an object (like xxx.yyy) it's true when yyy exists in xxx, which means || is a bad idea

[04:19:52] <FlorianBad> sickdyd: sure, but both p and o are defined. You can have yyy existing but being undefined, and || won't continue because that's true
[04:20:31] <FlorianBad> AFAIK on an object it's the EXISTENCE that makes it true, not its value

[04:25:41] <parv> Frankly I was expecting some error (or a warning at least) for trying use "x" after delete'ing it.
[04:26:08] <FlorianBad> you'd have to be in use strict I think

[14:00:15] <thykka> Swahili, JSON.parse and JSON.stringify are complementary to each other. The former converts JSON to JS object, and the latter does the opposite. When BOTH are used, it's usually because the author wants to clone an object, which is otherwise tricky in JS

[15:42:35] <silly> !var @gitesh
[15:42:35] <jellobot> gitesh, `var` defines a variable in the current function-level scope, and should not be used when `const` or `let` are available (see !babel, !const, and !let). Always use a keyword to declare variables, otherwise you will pollute the global scope (a keyword is required in strict mode).
[15:46:02] <gitesh> !tuts
[15:47:06] <silly> you have this.age = age; but age is nowhere defined

[16:21:18] <thykka> REST is not a standard :P

[16:23:08] <silly> what did he do instead of posting json?
[16:23:30] <OnkelTem> yeah, same q
[16:23:32] <velix> silly: He posts the single variables... What's not bad at all, but I didn't expect it :)
[16:23:37] <velix> That's what I've expected: https://bpa.st/raw/SEKA
[16:23:39] <OnkelTem> silly: protocol buffers!!!
[16:23:52] <velix> So I finished my API and he said, he cannot communicate with it ;)

[16:25:57] <velix> DPA: It just was a typo, sorry.
[16:27:03] <velix> OnkelTem: Yeah, he had to send a GeoJSON to me. Now I'm getting: -d id=78913 -d quantity=1 -d price=18 -d geojson="{...}"
[16:27:12] <DPA> And I can understand him, there is a resource 78912, so he probably expects get and post/put (I can never remember which one), to go to /api/json/78912, and sending stuff to /api/json to create a new resource.
[16:27:43] <DPA> Which are common conventions for REST APIs.
[16:27:56] <velix> DPA: Our convention was: JSON communication.
[16:28:55] <silly> i get application/x-www-form-urlencoded with your curl request

[23:09:51] <ljharb> or request/axios/fetch
[23:12:12] <velix> Those websites are pretty nice... but non-free. Ah, I've found an addon for Chrome doing something similar!
[23:12:33] *** Quits: OnkelTem (~OnkelTem@user/onkeltem) (Ping timeout: 268 seconds)
[23:12:56] <ljharb> velix: none of those are websites
[23:12:59] <ljharb> they're all free software tools
[23:13:06] <velix> No? They,re websites.
[23:13:07] <ljharb> velix: why would you use a website to test APIs
[23:13:10] <ljharb> velix: no they are not
[23:13:14] <ljharb> velix: curl is a command line tool
[23:13:20] <ljharb> velix: and request, axios, and node-fetch are npm libraries
[23:13:22] <ljharb> all are free
[23:13:40] <velix> ljharb: https://reqbin.com/req/v0crmky0/rest-api-post-example
[23:13:41] <ljharb> and why would you test an API from inside a web browser? do it from the command line
[23:14:00] <ljharb> what you linked me to is a website
[23:14:02] <velix> Because it's way easier to interface then to scroll to the right position where you'd change a value.
[23:14:10] <velix> ljharb: like I said: a website.
[23:14:15] <ljharb> ok so you WANT a website
[23:14:22] <velix> that's what I said all the time :D
[23:14:22] <ljharb> you said "postman" and "curl" tho, which aren't website
[23:14:31] <ljharb> cURL is "curl"
[23:14:31] <velix> here, postman is a website :D
[23:14:43] <velix> https://www.postman.com/
[23:14:49] <velix> it's completly website based.
[23:14:57] <ljharb> ah ok
[23:15:09] <velix> But okay, I can code this on my own.
[23:15:13] <ljharb> i didn't know what it was then, and "i'm using curl" implied that a CLI tool was an alternative
[23:15:23] <ljharb> you'll be extremely limited doing it as a website
[23:15:28] <ljharb> because web browsers can't make arbitrary requests.
[23:15:32] <velix> ljharb: Actually you can do ANYTHING with this.
[23:15:35] <ljharb> lol
[23:15:37] <velix> (I mean postman)
[23:15:40] <velix> You can set anything curl can
[23:15:42] <ljharb> you can if you have a webserver that does the actual requests
[23:15:51] <ljharb> but then that's just a complex system that wraps a CLI tool with a webpage

[23:16:02] <velix> That's the whole concept behind postman... you can even send raw stuff.
[23:16:02] <ljharb> not sure that's easier than scrolling on a command line command to make a change :-p
[23:16:25] <velix> ljharb: The problem is, it's not for ME, but for a worker of us.
[23:16:29] <velix> He can't get along with shell.
[23:16:31] <velix> Too stupid.
[23:16:51] <velix> But really, I think of coding it on my own. That's what better and it's not complicated.
[23:17:07] <ljharb> lol
[23:17:09] <ljharb> good luck
[23:17:19] <ljharb> but if a tech worker can't use the terminal, find a better tech worker
[23:17:22] <velix> I just could read all the fields from the frontend and run cURL in the backend. so he can test the API.

[23:17:40] <velix> Nah, he's a geographer, like me. We can't afford another techn worker. He just should test the API
[23:17:54] <velix> and we want something unprofessional. more likely to find bugs :)
[23:18:00] <velix> someone*
[23:18:06] <ljharb> lol
[23:18:11] <ljharb> not on an api
[23:18:11] <velix> because unexpected input = good

[23:27:13] <systemfault> Ah, right
