[10:20:39] <AadVersteden[m]> * Rocket Chat (and IRC, because history).
[10:21:03] <AadVersteden[m]> I also thought I saw thread support being merged around newyear but I don't see any client doing anything remotely similar to threading.

[19:20:51] <Edmund[m]> <AadVersteden[m]> "> <@madnificent:matrix.org..." <- I believe spaces are visible now, in Element, by default. When other chat clients will support it, IDK. 
[19:20:51] <Edmund[m]> To setup your own server, you could use EMS(https://element.io/matrix-services I'm currently testing it out, for $10 a month it's hard to get a node on a cloud provider for that cheap)
[19:20:51] <Edmund[m]> That's too bad that rocket chat isn't bridged :(. I don't see other open source chat apps having much of a model in the future. I see them using matrix under the hood, and having different UI takes(which is part of what I love about it, the real difference in chat apps is the UI/UX and not so much the backend. Just like Email)

[19:23:28] <Edmund[m]> I guess personally I'm more interested in pulling all the chat apps together. I'm tired of hoping between slack, discord, and teams, then you have some random group on gitter, and then you're missing the whole IRC crowd.
