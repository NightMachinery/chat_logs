[00:10:30] <technomancy> I was kinda shocked that it worked tbh

[17:34:45] <companion_cube> mTvare[m]: probably easier to support :p
[17:34:59] <companion_cube> (or more hype, who knows)
[17:35:21] <mTvare[m]> Most probably hype
[17:36:02] <mTvare[m]> c++ and c have the same LSP, considering they probably need only LSP for new languages
[17:36:18] <mTvare[m]> so supporting c would mean indirectly supporting c/c++/obj-c/obj-c++
[17:37:25] <mTvare[m]> and even go is added, so probably hype for new languages
[17:39:12] <companion_cube> I don't think they use LSP
[17:39:32] <mTvare[m]> > It’s written in Kotlin mainly, a little bit of Rust for native parts, Skiko (Skija + AWT)
[17:39:32] <mTvare[m]> They have used rust to build this, maybe that might be reason
[17:39:38] <mTvare[m]> * might be the reason
[17:39:38] <companion_cube> they already have intellij plugins for all of these
[17:39:47] <companion_cube> so I think it's just a question of priority
