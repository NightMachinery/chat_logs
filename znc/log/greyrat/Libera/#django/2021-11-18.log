[04:03:47] <T-101> hello. I'm having a weird thing in django, and in a project that has not exhibited this behaviour before
[04:04:17] <T-101> I have a django instance running in an http and only with IP-address
[04:04:49] <T-101> when DEBUG = True, evenything works. when DEBUG = False, login stops working
[04:05:13] <T-101> I enter u/p but after that it just redirects me back to the login screen, without any error
[04:05:55] <T-101> doesnt authenticate. entering a wrong password gives the usual nag
[04:06:26] <T-101> I have the IP in ALLOWED_HOSTS, otherwise nothing would work
[04:07:21] <T-101> usually I run this instance with https and DNS, but this is the first time I've done it without ssl and DNS
[04:08:51] *** Quits: defjam (~eb0t@90.197.82.19) (Ping timeout: 250 seconds)

[04:10:31] <T-101> that would explain a lot, actually. but how do I debug? there's nothing useful in browser debug tools, network
[04:10:53] *** Joins: defjam (~eb0t@90.203.122.187)
[04:11:38] <T-101> I am fairly sure that this will go away once the server has DNS and https. the django project is sound
[04:11:51] *** Quits: GinFuyou (~GinFuyou@reya.cloud.tilaa.com) (Remote host closed the connection)
[04:12:19] <la_croix_> Probably not best practice, but I usually comment out the csrf middleware to see if the problem goes away
[04:12:58] <T-101> let's try that just to see
[04:14:35] <T-101> hmm, didn't go away
[04:18:32] <la_croix_> Maybe have a look at the cookies being stored in your browser?
[04:18:45] <T-101> Django==3.2.7
[04:18:46] <T-101> btw
[04:19:27] <T-101> been trying in incognito and normal browser mode
[04:20:00] <T-101> thing that boggles the mind is that everything works when debug is true, and fails when debug is false
[04:21:01] <T-101> that same repo is running elsewhere and runs fine, the only difference is that this one doesnt have https and has no DNS
[04:21:24] <T-101> the OS and docker versions too
[04:21:37] <T-101> +same
[04:21:49] <la_croix_> What is the value of SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE
[04:22:26] <la_croix_> Because if that's true, the browser might refuse to store the session cookie over HTTP, and therefore drop your successful login, sending you back to the login page
[04:23:09] <T-101> oh god youre right
[04:23:23] <T-101> it is True
[04:24:42] <T-101> BOOM it works
[04:25:02] <T-101> thanks la_croix_ :) lifesaver
[04:25:12] <la_croix_> Nice :) To be fair, it should be True in production. Glad I could help!

[04:26:12] <T-101> but it doesn't account for when the service is running in http instead of https
[04:27:31] <T-101> so now I making that setting to come from ENV from now on
[04:27:48] <T-101> either case, thanks again :) you nailed it and saved my day :)

[04:35:08] <T-101> indeed
[04:35:38] <T-101> I even had a setting for that, but I've always run this repo in localhost or https
[04:36:13] <T-101> now I am running it on http because DNS guys are lagging :)
[04:37:25] <T-101> this would've been fixed automatically with DNS and letsencrypt in place, but good to remind me of that one setting

[05:14:48] <LuxuryMode> I'm looking to upgrade from Django 3.1 to 3.2. which introduces the default type for primary keys of BigAutoField. I am trying to go the route of running some migrations by adding `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD='django.db.models.BigAutoField'` to my settings. But after doing this and running `makemigrations`, Django does not appear to be generating any migrations. What am I doing wrong here?
[05:17:26] <LuxuryMode> The `id` fields are currently `AutoField` which translate to `integer` at the DB column level.

[08:32:05] <kosc> Hello! I'm trying to move the User model from one app in my Django project to another one. Doing that as described here - https://realpython.com/move-django-model/#the-django-way-rename-the-table (the Django way). Stuck on manage.py migrate step, because the model set as AUTH_USER_MODEL and inherited from AbstractUser. So if I'm trying to migrate with old value in AUTH_USER_MODEL - it obviously cannot find
[08:32:11] <kosc> the user model. If I'm trying to set the new one User model - it cannot migrate because migration admin.0001_inital should be done before the User's migration (InconsistentMigrationHistory happens).
[08:32:37] <kosc> Sorry for breaked up messages, maybe it's limitations of the IRC or default irssi's settings.

[13:56:31] <FunkyBob> possibly
[13:56:48] <FunkyBob> injecting a fragment of HTML into your page is easy...
[13:56:53] <FunkyBob> dynamically loading JS is not hard
[13:57:02] <FunkyBob> doing both in the same request?  is less easy
[13:58:01] <pycode> FunkyBob, no no wait i have this simple code: https://bpa.st/TJHQ  a view reply to that call with just the html of the form in need to load inside this model... i am just asking if...loading the form AND a small piece of js inside it...is wrong or not,
[13:58:06] *** Quits: szymon__ (~ugh@185.244.214.60) (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
[13:58:20] <pycode> it is just a GET request where i load html that has the form + js to run the form
[13:58:37] <FunkyBob> wait
[13:58:39] <pycode> then for submit i will do a post to the same view and get the response...and put the response inside the modal body agian
[13:58:42] <pycode> *again
[13:58:43] <FunkyBob> "load inside this model" ... or modal?
[13:58:50] <pycode> modal
[13:58:55] <FunkyBob> "wrong" is not clear here
[13:58:55] <pycode> sorry
[13:59:32] <pycode> FunkyBob, yeah i know but i remember that for some reason you said me that JS should not be loaded that way but should be loaded in the main request and not on the modal call
[13:59:40] <pycode> but...maybe... i do not remember correctly
[13:59:41] <FunkyBob> maybe
[14:00:21] <pycode> i think is ok to load inside that modal the html + js to run that form

[14:02:17] <FunkyBob> you're not making a lot of sense
[14:02:27] <FunkyBob> are you saying use JS to load the HTML and show it in the modal?
[14:02:35] <FunkyBob> or use JS to load HTML _and_ JS ?

[14:04:40] <pycode> no, wait..i have this piece of js inside the main page: https://bpa.st/TJHQ  as you can see that code call another page that load the content of the modal...that content HAS:  1. the html of the form   2. JS code to work with that form
[14:04:45] <pycode> so i am asking if...
[14:05:21] <pycode> i should load html + js on that request...OR....if i should move the JS part inside a global .js file instead of loading it in that call
[14:05:24] <FunkyBob> when you say "call another page"
[14:05:32] <FunkyBob> do you mean fetch from another URL?
[14:05:36] <pycode> FunkyBob, another view another url fetch another url
[14:05:38] <pycode> ues
[14:05:40] <pycode> yes
[14:06:01] <pycode> fetch another url to load the content of the modal from there
[14:06:06] <FunkyBob> there are reasons to go either way...
[14:06:29] <FunkyBob> loading the JS lets you update html+js together, and not need to re-deploy the 'global' JS
[14:07:00] <pycode> exactly...so i think i should leave everything html + js on that view
[14:07:03] <pycode> to load everything
[14:07:04] <pycode> ok
[14:07:15] <pycode> pardon for my no-sense questions :D
[14:07:41] <pycode> i really hate the fact that i am using bootstrap 4 that still has jquery..so i must use jquery for that part
[14:07:55] <FunkyBob> nothing is forcing you to keep using jquery
[14:08:03] <FunkyBob> not for everything, anyway
[14:08:31] <la_croix_> pycode: FWIW, I upgrade a very large project from bootstrap 4 to 5 (via react-bootstrap), it took about fifteen minutes, it's worth doing if you find the time
[14:08:49] <pycode> yes no i am reducing the part with jquery, but for modals i still use it
[14:09:02] <pycode> la_croix_, yeah i have to try it too

[18:10:43] <pycode> hello
[18:10:53] <pycode> how do you deal with ajax call and redirect ?
[18:17:37] <dodo> pycode: can you be more specific?
[18:19:33] <pycode> dodo, i send a post request via $.ajax
[18:19:44] <pycode> the problem is that i have an UPdateView that reply to that request
[18:19:57] <pycode> if the form is valid it redirects to another url
[18:20:15] <pycode> so if i fetch that URL via $.ajax i need to understand if there was a redirect
[18:20:47] <dodo> sounds like a javascript question, just check the return status/location header?
[18:21:08] <bparker> or return something like a json object that you parse in order to see if a redirect is necessary, and then handle that yourself
[18:21:24] <pycode> in success callback? hmm i need to try
[18:21:36] *** Quits: la_croix_ (~la_croix@cpc117350-walt24-2-0-cust237.13-2.cable.virginm.net) (Remote host closed the connection)
[18:21:51] <pycode> bparker, the problem is that i am creating a modal and the modal content is fetched via ajax call so now
[18:21:53] <pycode> the problem is
[18:22:02] <pycode> if the form is invalid i receive an HTML
[18:22:09] <pycode> if the form is good i receive a redirect
[18:22:26] <pycode> so what do you mean exactly? should i try to parse the response
[18:22:27] <pycode> ?
[18:22:40] <pycode> if yes it means that there is an error
[18:22:41] <pycode> ?
[18:23:00] <bparker> you could return json instead in both cases, with a status saying if the reply contains HTML or a URL to redirect to
[18:24:02] <bparker> dodo: can you check location header of an ajax response from javascript?
[18:24:08] <bparker> is that even possible
[18:25:20] <pycode> if i can check the header i think i can go with that
[18:25:28] <pycode> checking
[18:28:34] <pycode> hmm i think "success" is the worng callback
[18:31:30] <dodo> pycode: or return a json response for ajax requests specifically, i'm assuming you also have "regular" requests to that view?
[18:31:51] <dodo> pycode: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/ref/request-response/#django.http.HttpRequest.is_ajax
[18:31:57] <pycode> dodo,  no in that case i just use the view for modal content
[18:32:16] <dodo> oh, then i'd return json, yeah
[18:32:55] <dodo> (maybe, not sure what exactly you're doing)
[18:33:38] <pycode> dodo, i am putting a form inside a modal and i am loading the content fetching a different url, so this form is returned from another url
