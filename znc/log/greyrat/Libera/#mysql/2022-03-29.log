Of course I need a related table with a more "lang" field. But what with main table, "phase"? Do you think it is better to leave "name" and "description" fields there as main language (for example "english" as defualt language) and add other languages in related table?

[17:04:15] <znf> A question about master and replicas. I have master > replica > replica with filter (only on a single db) > replica, in that hierarchy -- as one client wants access to his db on his premises, but we don't want to offer access to the rest of the DBs on that master.
[17:05:08] <znf> Somehow the replica with filter stopped replicating due to a structure change, with the following error message: [ERROR] [MY-010584] [Repl] Slave SQL for channel '': Error 'Table 'locations' already exists' on query. Default database: 'clientdbname'. Query: 'create table locations [...]
[17:05:47] <lopid> and did it?
[17:05:49] <znf> Is there any reason why only the replica with the filter would have stopped in this chain? Trying to understand how to avoid this in the future
[17:05:54] *** Quits: gulzar (~gulzar@49.206.240.149) (Quit: gulzar)
[17:06:14] <znf> lopid, did it already exist? or?
[17:06:19] <lopid> yes
[17:07:08] <lopid> i think with SBR it should have kept replicating. is it RBR?
[17:07:23] <znf> yes, I do believe it did
[17:07:30] <znf> let me double check, I think it's row
[17:09:12] <znf> master has binlog_format=ROW
[17:09:41] <znf> Oh. But the first replica has it commented out
[17:10:10] <znf> But it's ROW, too, checked the running var
[17:10:22] <lopid> better to query the server that assume from config file
[17:10:26] <znf> And so is the replica with the filter
[17:10:39] <znf> I did, it's ROW across all of them
[17:11:22] <lopid> do you know how it came to exist beforehand? i assume it was a CREATE TABLE that tripped it
[17:12:05] <znf> Sadly no, and it's a LONG time since it crashed. We weren't monitoring it because it wasn't part of our setup (as it was just something we quickly whipped out at the request of the client), so it's been out of sync since... August
[17:12:37] <lopid> ah, so it's not important :)
[17:12:47] <znf> Yeah, apparently it's less important that they made it out to be...
[17:13:07] <lopid> were binlogs kept?
[17:13:07] <znf> But I'm still pondering why only the one with the filter would have stopped replicating
[17:13:25] <znf> only relay-bin
[17:13:39] <znf> I mean, the replica with the filter kept all the relay bins and exhausted it's disk space
[17:13:52] <lopid> oh
[17:14:19] <znf> that's how I noticed it, if it weren't about the disk space it would have gone unnoticed
[17:14:57] <znf> the 2 replicas on our hardware are lxc containers and it caught my eye that it used all it's disk space
[17:15:19] <znf> not sure why it's kept all of them tough, I assume because it wasn't able to commit them?
[17:15:22] <lopid> could it be that the client added the table before it had a chance to be created from replication?
[17:16:10] <znf> the client has no access to our replica
[17:16:15] <lopid> if replication ceased back then, the schema on the replica should be how it was before replicating, so there should be no more other changes since then on it. if there are, suspiciousâ€¦
[17:16:19] <lopid> to theirs
[17:16:35] <znf> master (ok) > full replica (ok) > filter replica (failed) > their replica (changes didn't reach there)
[17:16:37] <lopid> *how it was before replication stopped
[17:16:57] <lopid> oh, ok
[17:17:13] <lopid> the filter replica is yours
[17:17:55] <znf> yes, we host a few clients on that DB, and we didn't want them to have any kind of access to the other clients DB, so we added that filter replica in the mid-way
[17:18:01] <znf> s/DB/server/
[17:18:12] <znf> not sure if there was another way to do that
[17:19:43] <lopid> and there are no binlogs or relay logs from the filter replica to the replica? if there are, a statement that created the table might be in one
[17:20:31] <znf> we only log 4 days, I beleve? expire_logs_days = 4
[17:20:54] <znf> but I do assume the statement is around here:
[17:20:54] <lopid> i don't knowâ€¦

[17:27:25] <lopid> comparing the schema as it is now to how it should have looked might help shed some light. if you can
[17:27:35] <znf> I'm trying to make the app guy who run the query to actually remember what query he run
[17:27:54] <znf> I'm just puzzled as why the first replica (with no filter) picked up the changes just fine
[17:29:54] <lopid> an errored query shouldn't get logged, iirc. i'm thinking someone did something extra on the filter replica
[17:30:48] <znf> There's only 2 people that have access to that filter replica, but basically it's just me, and I haven't logged on that since June
[17:32:15] <lopid> do you have the filter replicas binlogs and relaylogs from the time?
[17:32:15] <znf> So nobody has run anything manually on it, it's not even directly accessible on the internet, as it only has a private IP address and we ssh-tunnel towards the end client
[17:33:26] <znf> no, the only relay_logs I have were the ones I listed above (and following after that, obviously)
[17:34:17] <znf> hm, actually, wait, hetzner2bak-relay-bin.000171 contains stuff rom August 10
[17:35:09] <lopid> just thinking you could have compared queries coming in to those going out, to see if there was anything new
