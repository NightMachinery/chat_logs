[01:52:16] <evilgohan2> Not quite the same, but not great either. At least, this time, it wasn't because they had 3 RAID5s in a RAID5.

[01:53:21] <evilgohan2> Also, it's more of a "Hey, we fucked up. Don't do like us" video this time around.
[01:54:13] <evilgohan2> Besides, I can't talk. I had a 8TB fail in a RAID array last week, and two other discs that had their file systems go corrupt on the same day.

[01:55:34] <evilgohan2> Seems sensible. I'm monitoring prices of 14TB HDDs. If they hit $200 USD each again, I'm jumping on it.
[01:56:29] <evilgohan2> Circling back around though, I'm a lone person. Not an entire LLC with dozens of employees that failed to hire or task someone (or, preferably, more than one person) solely to IT Operational Support / Maintenance.
[01:57:47] <evilgohan2> But at the same time, by their own admission, that data wasn't critical. Plus, they'll just parlay it into a new build that they can monetize and recoup any losses in like one video. So... overall, they'll come out ahead.

[02:23:02] <evilgohan2> lol @ the Old_age flags
[02:23:19] <rawktucc> yeah smartctl :)
[02:23:26] <evilgohan2> I had a drive from ~2007 running up until last year. That thing was all but dead though lol
[02:23:43] <evilgohan2> It was in an old C2D machine... that also happened to be my router :S
[02:23:58] <evilgohan2>  SMART(HD Tray No: 1) testing has completed, the result is normal.
[02:24:27] <evilgohan2> These drives are really 8 years old... my goodness.
[02:24:40] <evilgohan2> or ,rather, have been powered up for ~8 years
[02:25:01] <evilgohan2> save for drive 5 which replaced one that was DOA, so it's a few hours younger :D
[02:25:16] <evilgohan2> all show 0 bad sectors though, and SMART data is healthy across the board.
[02:25:39] <evilgohan2> so I might as well just let it keep going. 5x 4TB WD REDs.
[02:26:51] <rawktucc> I have 4x18TB, 4x10TB, 4x8TB
[02:26:55] <rawktucc> so those smaller 8 gotta go
[02:27:23] <evilgohan2> My file server has 10x 4TB HGST NAS drives in it... 8 are in one array, 2 are in a small RAID1.
[02:27:23] <rawktucc> additionally technically 1x18TB and 2x10TB are large consistent parity drives so in theory I may gain more space by moving everything to 18TBs and ZFS
[02:27:34] <rawktucc> but like
[02:27:36] <evilgohan2> Then there's a 4x 1TB cage attached to it in RAID0.
[02:27:43] <evilgohan2> But oh no, that's not the really good one.
[02:28:36] <evilgohan2> The REALLY good one is the Synology DS3615xs I got for free with 10x 2TB WD Enteprise drives in it, and 2x 1TB Samsung 850 EVOs

[02:44:52] <rawktucc> 4GB of ram damn
[02:45:13] <rawktucc> it's funny because easystores are actually more expensive than bare drives

[02:45:59] <rawktucc> it's more expensive than bare toshibas or seagates I linked above, but
[02:46:06] <rawktucc> it would be good to diversify the purchased models
[02:46:06] <evilgohan2> right now, the lowest you're paying for a 14TB WD RED PRO is $329.99 USD via Amazon
[02:46:22] <evilgohan2> at best buy, a 14TB WD easyStore is $329.99

[02:48:46] <rawktucc> ok so this toshiba is shit then
[02:48:50] <evilgohan2> In my experience, most HDDs fail on an extreme bathtub curve at either the start of their lifespan, or at the end of it. Rarely inbetween.
[02:48:50] <rawktucc> it uses 512B sectors?
[02:49:01] <evilgohan2> 2 years should be fine.

[02:51:31] <evilgohan2> Curiosity: in a single array, why would you _want_ to have differing models, rawktucc? Isn't consistency ideal?
[02:51:41] <rawktucc> Yeah it probably would be

[22:17:44] <imMute> as a thirty-something, I feel that.
