[00:00:53] <klaxa> how does it feel that one piece is older than you
[00:00:55] <klaxa> by a lot
[00:01:22] <holorum> So many things are older than me.
[00:01:47] <holorum> I appriciate them. Not for how old they are but that they could pull of many things with the technology of that time
[00:01:51] <emmeka> klaxa why must you make me feel old ;~;
[00:03:04] <berlin36> I feel good, klaxa
[00:03:53] <berlin36> Well not very good tho
[00:04:00] <berlin36> My back is hurting bad
[00:04:03] <berlin36> :C
[00:04:55] <emmeka> though really, berlin36 is probably not older than the western release of One Piece. That was significantly later.
[00:05:03] <emmeka> 2003/2004?
[00:05:08] <berlin36> 2005

[00:05:50] <emmeka> berlin36 it hurts my feelings that I was already reading manga before some current gen weebs were born
[00:06:05] <berlin36> xD
[00:06:16] * emmeka had a Viz Shounen Jump subscription back in 2004 or so, which had the early chapters of One Piece
[00:06:27] <holorum> I mean... by fantranslation is how we got a beautiful Duwang
[00:08:19] <berlin36> It hurts my feelings that i don't fit into my bed 
[00:08:21] <emmeka> I remember watching One Piece on Toonami around the same time, though I was never really a big fan
[00:08:45] <holorum> Didn't they just borked the pacing of the anime?
[00:08:48] <berlin36> I've watched about 200 episodes
[00:08:53] <emmeka> but you didn't get a lot of choice in what anime you watch back then, I guess

[00:20:04] <mexen> I see
[00:20:31] <holorum> Monogatari is pretty well adapted but many things are left out such as half the jokes in the character's thought processes, some of which is flashed in Bake for like two frames per paragraph

[00:21:17] <emmeka> mexen usually reading the source material will just add extra to the adaptations you've already watched, and let you read ahead of the anime
[00:21:27] <holorum> No Game No Life is somewhat different as the anime changed quite a bit in the first arc but that was the idea of the author. Other than that, the LN has 10 volumes 4 of which are adapted. Three for the anime, one for the movie
[00:21:33] <mexen> O-Ke
[00:21:47] <emmeka> and yeah, sometimes animes just outright alter things to fit the runtime
[00:21:56] <holorum> Another's anime adaptation was horrible compared to the LN
[00:23:23] <holorum> Also: Saga of Tanya the Evil is a completely different beast in the anime, a whole other thing in the manga, and another in the LN. They are just so different in thought proces
[00:23:50] <berlin36> I listen to some songs i used to listen to about 6 months ago
[00:24:11] <berlin36> Such a strange feeling of comfort and memories of that time
[00:24:12] <mexen> I just realized that I read a badly translated Tanya LN when the anime came out LOL
[00:24:18] <mexen> Looking for NGNL
[00:24:22] <berlin36> Lol
[00:24:39] <emmeka> mexen that is one problem with reading LNs... you have to be pretty choosy with translations
[00:24:52] <emmeka> a lot of LN fan translations are atrocious. some official releases are also terrible.
[00:24:53] <holorum> I usually buy books. Phisically.
[00:25:08] <berlin36> I pirate 'em books
[00:25:15] <mexen> arrr
[00:25:17] <holorum> emmeka: there are some, but I haven't run into much
[00:25:24] <berlin36> Yes mexen
[00:25:33] <emmeka> holorum I've run into many.
[00:25:39] <holorum> berlin36: how are you able to read on the computer screen and not having your eyes bleed out?
[00:25:56] <holorum> emmeka: I mean official releases
[00:26:23] <berlin36> Well idk, im okay, + i have redshift (makes the screen softer and warmer) 
[00:26:37] <emmeka> there have been some official releases that just butcher everything. look at Tokyopop's attempted release of Kino's Journey, which pissed off the Japanese author so much that they pulled the contract.
[00:26:40] <berlin36> But i'd like to ask, how much do you read?
[00:26:54] <berlin36> I may read for an hour or so
[00:27:10] <berlin36> After that i get tired

[01:25:28] <ButterNoodle> cool to -40 the night before.. you may be able to be somewhat comfortable until noon

[01:29:23] <ButterNoodle> there are
[01:29:30] <theholyduck> ok there should be bigger ones

[01:30:00] <MootPoot> mostly they target people who still have like single pane windows
[01:30:13] <theholyduck> like as a way of improving the energy infrastructure and reduce peak demand 
[01:30:15] <MootPoot> and cheap targets like free replacement off all your indascents with LEDs
[01:30:20] <MootPoot> but thats it

[01:30:33] <MootPoot> they wont help you out with like redoing your entire wall insulation
[01:33:12] <ButterNoodle> I put about a meter of insulation in my attic in the mid 2000's and it was paid for with tax credits
[01:33:13] <theholyduck> https://thebreakthrough.org/blog/treadmill-decarbonization-doesnt-help somebody posted this earlier. apparently california is shedding 2 nuclear reactors that produce more than all the wind turbines in the state

[01:33:20] <theholyduck> or like 40% of the solar in the state
[01:33:33] <theholyduck> such a stupid step backwards
[01:33:33] <ButterNoodle> year after replaced the AC and got a decent credit
[01:33:45] <ButterNoodle> they stopped doing that years ago
[01:33:58] <ButterNoodle> NO NUKES

[01:34:15] <theholyduck> :P 
[01:34:27] <theholyduck> i mean my stance is its fine to get rid of nuclear power plants once you got rid of all the fosil fuel ones
[01:34:27] <theholyduck> first
[01:34:34] <theholyduck> nuclear for all its potential harms 
[01:34:39] <ButterNoodle> pls put one in my back yard
[01:34:40] <theholyduck> is not going to boil the fucking planet
[01:34:59] <ButterNoodle> yea long term risks to env and human health are greater with dino
[01:35:27] <theholyduck> like HONESTLY: a couple of fukushimas is PROBABLY worth it to stop global warming
[01:35:34] <theholyduck> if we wanna do like enviormental impact maths
[01:35:39] <ButterNoodle> wonder how many have died of black lung in the coal mines, or cancer from all the mercury fallout from coal fired plants
[01:35:42] <theholyduck> and nuclear reactors are built safer than that generally
[01:35:58] <MootPoot> theholyduck:  not in my backyard
[01:36:10] <ButterNoodle> I'll take MootPoot's reactor
[01:36:15] <theholyduck> MootPoot:  whole planet is your back yard though
[01:36:15] <theholyduck> :P
[01:36:16] <ButterNoodle> you can put 2 here
[01:36:26] <MootPoot> the NIMBY people aside, we need to btfo of those envirornmenal people who hate on nuclear
[01:36:32] <MootPoot> its the best realsitc option
[01:36:42] <MootPoot> but they resist against it like its the coming of the devil
[01:37:06] <ButterNoodle> yea shut down the fossil fuel power, and run it off of nukes ez
[01:37:12] <Bco1981> enviro-mental people.
[01:37:28] <ButterNoodle> literally money in the bank
[01:38:57] <ButterNoodle> at the individual level.. all I can do is solar
[01:39:10] <ButterNoodle> might as well run an all electric car
[01:39:18] <MootPoot> I want to get a EV at some point
[01:39:25] <theholyduck> ButterNoodle: norway is allready like over 50% all electrc cars
[01:39:26] <MootPoot> I've been eyeing a used nissan leaf
[01:39:27] <theholyduck> for new sales
[01:39:29] <ButterNoodle> *piss in the ocean to try and raise the tide
[01:39:39] <MootPoot> but that battery cost...
[01:39:39] <theholyduck> and plug in hybrids make up most of the rest
[01:39:54] <theholyduck> MootPoot: norways trick is to tax regular cars into oblivion
[01:39:54] <ButterNoodle> theholyduck: yea, if we did that here - ur burning FFs to charge the cars
[01:39:55] <theholyduck> :P
[01:40:16] <MootPoot> theholyduck:  not to mention massive incentives for EVs
[01:40:20] <theholyduck> no
[01:40:22] <theholyduck> thats the incentive
[01:40:30] <MootPoot> you have the most teslas as well
[01:40:31] <theholyduck> you dont pay taxes on your ev
[01:40:32] <SpiritOfSummer> are you fucking kidding me
[01:40:33] <MootPoot> or something like that
[01:40:34] <ButterNoodle> yea there would be riots
[01:40:51] <ButterNoodle> that is a tax incentive tho
[01:40:51] <theholyduck> MootPoot:  like we have no other financial incentive
[01:40:55] <theholyduck> ButterNoodle: sure :P
[01:40:58] <MootPoot> huh
[01:40:59] <theholyduck> but as i said THE incentive
[01:41:01] <ButterNoodle> dont pay taxes
[01:41:04] <theholyduck> is that non EVs get taxed to fuck
[01:41:18] <ButterNoodle> like how much?
[01:41:30] <theholyduck> depends on the car 
[01:41:38] <ButterNoodle> 300 a year for a compact suv?
[01:41:39] <theholyduck> basicly you pay a sum thats calculated based on how heavy the car is
[01:41:41] <theholyduck> how big the engine 
[01:41:46] <theholyduck> ButterNoodle: purchase tax
[01:41:54] <theholyduck> how much the engine polutes
[01:41:54] <ButterNoodle> oh
[01:41:55] <theholyduck> etc.etc
[01:42:16] <ButterNoodle> I paid sales tax on my car, plus an excise tax every year
[01:42:29] <ButterNoodle> as the car gets older the excise tax is less
[01:42:51] <ButterNoodle> but for a 30K shit box its like 3-400 a year
[01:43:27] <theholyduck> ok. so like a ford mustang gt fastback
[01:43:33] <theholyduck> tarts at 36k usd
[01:43:47] <theholyduck> in america
[01:43:55] <theholyduck> same car is 116k usd
[01:43:56] <theholyduck> in norway
[01:44:08] <theholyduck> this is how teslas become "budget" cars"
[01:44:09] <theholyduck> over here
[01:44:21] <theholyduck> you could have a shitty sedan with a small engine. 
[01:44:25] <theholyduck> or you could have a tesla
[01:44:45] <theholyduck> even like a 50k usd tesla is reasonably priced here
[01:44:53] <MootPoot> theholyduck:  what about motorcycles
[01:45:01] <MootPoot> do you get taxed the same for them
[01:45:08] <MootPoot> electric motorcycles are a joke
[01:45:11] <theholyduck> i have no idea how the stuff works for motorbikes. but i ASUME so?

[01:55:49] <theholyduck> so the us comes out real well on the average

[02:01:59] <HeTo> IIRC here you have to pay taxes based on what a similar car in Finland would have cost, or if it's a rare car the customs determine some price and issue taxes based on that

[02:04:21] <theholyduck> as i said. the tax works based on a given set of factors
[02:04:57] <theholyduck> in norway we take a ton of factors into consideration

[05:27:26] <theholyduck> Jigsy: I mean. I already have moral/ethical qualms about deepfakes. Generating convincing naked photos of people and posting them online is not a thing I would defend or applaud
[05:27:59] <theholyduck> And there might need to be legislation on that type of pornography
[05:28:06] <Jigsy> I believe they want to make it a crime to simply generate them.
[05:28:41] <theholyduck> That's not what the article says
[05:28:54] <Jigsy> ...
[05:28:56] <theholyduck> They specifically mention distribution
[05:28:57] <Jigsy> Ooh, Deja Vu.
[05:29:04] <Jigsy> 3>"Parliament needs to have the opportunity to debate whether nude and sexually explicit images generated digitally without consent should be outlawed
[05:29:28] <theholyduck> Yes. The distribution of them is the main thing they are focusing on
[05:29:39] <Jigsy> They're also focusing on what I said, too.
[05:30:05] <Jigsy> I'm guessing this would mean it'd be illegal to draw people naked too.
[05:30:15] <marblesurf> >"If software providers develop this technology, they are complicit in a very serious crime and should be required to design their products to stop this happening."
[05:30:15] <Jigsy> Since the UK considers drawings to be people too legally.
[05:30:39] <marblesurf> the software makers aren't at fault here though i think
[05:30:48] <Jigsy> This is going to be one interesting shitshow.
[05:30:51] <theholyduck> Only the most strict and pessimistic read of what that article says promotes your view. 
[05:31:10] <theholyduck> That quote could just as easily mean to crack down on distribution
[05:31:31] <theholyduck> Which I think is going to be more and more necessary
[05:31:40] <theholyduck> As time goes on
[05:31:48] <Jigsy> Right, but as I said, they want to crack down on generation too.
[05:31:53] <Jigsy> Which... is just one huge can of worms.
[05:32:02] <Jigsy> Like, photoshopping people would suddenly be a crime.
[05:32:04] <theholyduck> Might still be needed to though
[05:32:15] <Jigsy> Also they've done AI nudes in films.
[05:32:20] <Jigsy> Well, not AI.
[05:32:24] <theholyduck> Photoshops require skill though
[05:32:26] <Jigsy> The other thing.

[05:33:12] <theholyduck> The big problem I foresee as this shit gets easier
[05:33:12] <Jigsy> Let's go with Chroma Key because I honestly can't remember the word.
[05:33:50] <theholyduck> Is teenage boys running photos of girls from school through this and passing them around as real
[05:34:02] <Jigsy> ...
[05:34:12] <theholyduck> This is going to create so much trauma
[05:34:13] <Jigsy> So, you're worried about children distributing something that's already illegal?
[05:34:39] <theholyduck> Being able to make it with the press of 2 button yes
[05:34:45] <theholyduck> *1
[05:34:56] <Jigsy> CP is illegal anyway, so that's a moot point.
[05:35:09] <theholyduck> Sure. But this is fictional. 
[05:35:15] <Jigsy> Irrelevant.
[05:35:19] <Jigsy> Moot point.
[05:35:34] <theholyduck> Also there is already a to pandemic of this shit happening in schools
[05:35:54] <theholyduck> As a teacher in training we had to learn to deal with it
[05:35:56] <Jigsy> You mean children who take photos of themselves naked and get hit with CP charges?
[05:36:13] <theholyduck> No. Sharing photos of girls without their consent
[05:36:26] <theholyduck> If you now can just generate those photos from scratch
[05:36:30] <theholyduck> It will be even worse
[05:36:30] <marblesurf> what were you trained to do?
[05:36:34] <marblesurf> yeah
[05:36:51] <theholyduck> Call in counseling and police
[05:37:44] <theholyduck> Like if you are making software to do this with 1 click I think you are partially culpable for all the evil it will be used for
[05:37:55] <Jigsy> By that logic, we should ban cameras.
[05:38:13] <theholyduck> A camera has many legitimate purposes
[05:38:18] <Jigsy> So?
[05:38:28] <Jigsy> No cameras = no CP.
[05:38:40] <Jigsy> Regardless of if it has legitimate purposes.
[05:39:06] <theholyduck> Sure but what's the legitimate purpose of nudity software
[05:39:26] <theholyduck> If you want somebody's nudes get them in a way that person consents to
[05:39:42] <Jigsy> As I mentioned earlier, actors have done "nude scenes" in movies without actually being naked.
[05:39:58] <Jigsy> There's bound to be some angle somewhere.
[05:40:07] <theholyduck> Sure and they often use body doubles
[05:40:15] <theholyduck> But all parties consented

[05:42:42] <klaxa> it doesn't have to have a good
[05:43:00] <klaxa> but it still does have a right to exist since it's also an expression of free speech is it not?
[05:43:09] <theholyduck> Sure it does. If something is mostly or all bag. Societies regulate or ban that thing

[05:43:26] <marblesurf> the people that invented deepfakes probably didn't have revenge porn in mind

[05:43:49] <klaxa> well regulate okay actually
[05:43:57] <klaxa> but how do you regulate a bunch of numbers?
[05:43:59] <Jigsy> Not everything illegal is bad.
[05:44:08] <theholyduck> marblesurf: sure. But that's a more general thing than a website that makes any photo nude
[05:44:09] <klaxa> and not everything bad is illegal
[05:44:14] <Jigsy> Most is just malum prohibitum.
[05:44:19] <theholyduck> Deepfakes have uses but should be regulated
[05:44:35] <klaxa> well yeah it's pretty much the same argument
[05:44:44] <Jigsy> And then what, theholyduck?
[05:44:48] <Jigsy> Make the source code illegal?
[05:45:21] <theholyduck> You make using it without consent.  Especially using it and distributing the be results illegal

[05:45:56] <theholyduck> klaxa: deepfakes are here to stay. But we can regulate the usage
[05:45:59] <Jigsy> But if someone takes a photo of themselves naked, for example, shares it, then claims it was generated by AI and they didn't give consent...
[05:46:03] <Jigsy> ...what then?
[05:46:47] <theholyduck> Evidence is needed for crimes
[05:46:52] <klaxa> that's not even the worst part i'm thinking of, i see a future where deepfakes are banned for the public, but governments and a few private corporations can use them and fabricate all sorts of lies
[05:47:00] <theholyduck> A nude photo and a claim doesn't prove to anything
[05:47:24] <Jigsy> Okay, so how would you prove you didn't consent to the deepfake?
[05:47:46] <theholyduck> The usual way is sending a takedown to whoever is hosting it
[05:48:04] <Jigsy> But what if they did give consent originally?
[05:48:16] <theholyduck> Then there would be be evidence of that
[05:49:30] <theholyduck> Like it's already really hard to get revenge porn dealt with
[05:49:57] <theholyduck> All im saying is you should have at least that is much recourse
[05:50:00] <theholyduck> If not more
[05:50:21] <theholyduck> There needs to be more robust revenge porn laws aswell
[05:51:54] <theholyduck> Jigsy: my point is. If you are actually able to convince a court or the police that you in didn't consent to something. Currently that requires an absurd standard of proof
[05:52:25] <theholyduck> It's why do so many in rapes and what not go unprosecuted or lose in court

[14:06:38] <KatrinValerie> I swear the covid shot is addictive
[14:06:53] <momonoki> I think two is enough for me
[14:07:57] <KatrinValerie> But it seems it works more like flu shots in terms of immunity
[14:08:04] <KatrinValerie> So you need a refresh vaccination
[14:08:14] <berlin36> amigojapan: lemme check it
[14:08:16] <KatrinValerie> And they have to adapt the vaccine to the new variants
[14:08:42] <KatrinValerie> They currently offer some protection against the delta variation, but you can still get infected when fully vaccinated and spread it.
[14:08:44] <momonoki> yes, better wait until they make a new vaccine
[14:09:00] <KatrinValerie> but at a lower rate then unvaccinated folks obviously
[14:09:16] <KatrinValerie> momonoki: It is definitely protective against serious infections
[14:09:27] <KatrinValerie> You will get off with a mild case

[14:23:31] <theholyduck> shounen/seinen/shoujo/shounen are not genres
[14:23:37] <momonoki> theholyduck, whatever it is, amigojapan keeps asking me about recommendations
[14:23:45] <theholyduck> they are classification tags as to what magazine things were published in
[14:23:45] <theholyduck> :P
[14:24:17] <Urchin[emacs]> theholyduck: aren't they target demographics
[14:24:28] <theholyduck> Urchin[emacs]:  only TANGENTIALLY
[14:24:41] <theholyduck> in that a shounen magazine tends to target younger boys
[14:24:49] <theholyduck> and a seinen magaazine tends to target older men
[14:24:50] <amigojapan> theholyduck: I have seen a josei manga for sale, but it was all yonkoma
[14:25:06] <theholyduck> Urchin[emacs]:  and similarly for shoujou and josei
[14:25:15] <theholyduck> Urchin[emacs]:  the point thats important here. is that if a show was never a manga
[14:25:19] <theholyduck> it can never have this tag
[14:25:20] <Urchin[emacs]> theholyduck: not really something to get excited about
[14:25:28] <theholyduck> Urchin[emacs]:  indeed its not
[14:25:34] <theholyduck> its mostly a meaningless tag
[14:25:42] <theholyduck> but. so many websites put it front and center
[14:25:44] <theholyduck> like it means something
[14:25:57] <theholyduck> or invent the tag for shows that dont have one
[14:25:58] <momonoki> "older" seems to mean anyone that's no longer in high school
[14:26:15] <theholyduck> momonoki: sure :P because the STRICT split between seinen and shounen
[14:26:17] <amigojapan> theholyduck: but we can say "an anime that appeals to older women
[14:26:27] <theholyduck> is reading helpers on the kanji
[14:26:34] <theholyduck> momonoki: which kids need
[14:26:35] <momonoki> I don't understand why japan has created this artificial split
[14:26:37] <theholyduck> and not kids shouldnt
[14:26:44] <theholyduck> momonoki:  huh?
[14:26:57] <theholyduck> momonoki:  the split is the reading assistance marks
[14:27:00] <theholyduck> i.e furigana
[14:27:13] <theholyduck> the stuff for children has it the stuff for not children doesnt
[14:27:19] <momonoki> theholyduck, I mean for anime
[14:27:27] <theholyduck> the split never exists for anime
[14:27:36] <theholyduck> the term only means something in regards to manga
[14:28:11] <theholyduck> which is why the only time you can list it is for shows that are manga adaptions (or light novels if you are feeling especially pidgeonholy)

[19:02:51] <Omega037> Generally you use delimiters for storing in a non-human readable form
[19:03:15] <Omega037> If needed, it is rather simple to convert to human-readable when expressed
[19:07:31] <Nanobot> isekaijin: Basically, the reason to escape a character is to toggle whether that character is interpreted as a delimiter. If you now have two characters that could be interpreted as delimiters in this context, you'll have two characters you'll need to escape if you *don't* want them interpreted as delimiters.
