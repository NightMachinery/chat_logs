[04:19:21] <kline> in all honestly, im not even sure its actually really all that good
[04:19:48] <kline> its a single purpose language that just happens to take pretty much all the possible operations one might apply to a matrix and give them a unique sigil
[04:21:27] <imode> yeah, that's what I gathered.
[04:21:47] <imode> "I can write a text editor in four lines of K".
[04:21:48] <ignaloidas> It's really good at working with matrices because of that, and well recently a lot of "high profile prgramming" has been mainly manipulating matrices
[04:22:16] <kline> imode, "yeah cool but its really just like `import texteditor` in python"
[04:24:29] <imode> pretty much, yeah, with the sacrifice on readability.
[04:24:52] <imode> like that import statement's "weight" in characters gets treated as actual code.

[13:12:11] <enterprisey> I stick to what I know, and what I know is compilers and Wikipedia, and those are so fascinating they suck the oxygen away from anything else I might want to learn

[13:13:47] <enterprisey> I'm Enterprisey on Wikipedia, so I have a decent chunk of "internal" (that is, not too interesting if you don't edit a lot) stuff

[13:22:49] <enterprisey> I really, really don't know
[13:23:35] <enterprisey> for the onlookers, the Russian Wikinews project, the "news media" branch of wikimedia (of which wikipedia is the "encyclopedia" branch), managed to... uh... ddos the whole cluster, taking wikipedia down
[13:23:59] <enterprisey> if I recall correctly, they rapidly created 300 thousand articles
[13:24:54] <enterprisey> which, combined with some dreadful unmaintained PHP extension code they run that includes some blood-curdlingly inefficient queries, kept every last PHP worker we had in the servers busy
[13:24:54] <epilys> can't wikimedia governing body... impose sanctions on them?
[13:25:19] <enterprisey> I think the idea is we never actually said they couldn't do that
[13:25:43] <enterprisey> we have this policy where the project contributors should just do whatever and not care about performance, and let the server people handle it
[13:25:48] <epilys> at the very least start rate limiting when a usage hike is detected
[13:26:02] <enterprisey> yeah, so this is the second time this exact failure mode has happened
[13:26:38] <enterprisey> so we're gonna yank the extension (it's called DynamicPageList) - or maybe we've already done it - and then reconsider its usage globally
[13:26:43] <enterprisey> and by "we" I mean people more qualified than me
[13:27:11] <epilys> it's the only rational/pragmatic decision

[17:55:55] <kline> for a sunday brainteaser, i thought id see if i could do fizzbuzz without if or modulo
[17:55:56] <kline> https://paste.debian.net/1206232
[17:56:59] <Church> Okay I'm not grokking this
[17:57:04] <Church> Explanation?
[17:58:02] <kline> Church, ok, so fizzbuzz is about divisibility by 3 and 5, right?
[17:58:09] <Church> Ya
[17:58:17] <kline> what this really means is "every 3rd or 5th number gets special treatment"
[17:58:39] <kline> so i create a pair of generators that return an infinite stream of emptystring or "Fizz"/"Buzz"
[17:59:16] <kline> if both of those generators gave an emptystring, i print the number
[17:59:40] <kline> "buy kline, whats with the weird pattern reversal?"
[17:59:41] <kline> https://paste.debian.net/1206231
[18:00:21] <kline> i need some way of infinitely cycling over a list, that usually means counter%length, but it could also be the case that you keep creating a new clone of the pattern and emptying it
[18:00:36] <Church> Okay, nifty
[18:01:51] <kline> https://paste.debian.net/1206235/
[18:02:03] <kline> of course, its python so you can also just import solution, but thats no fun
[18:04:44] <kline> dead-end path: my embedded background wanted to solve the cyclic counter by masking only into the lower bits (counter%n is the same as counter&m, where m is a log2(n) long series of 1-bits - counter%16 is like counter&0b1111), but it turns out its proven that there is no number that is both a multiple of 3 and a power of two, so there is no way to make that happen :(
[18:17:06] <epilys> generators are so cool
[18:19:41] <riv> you want to cycle through a random permutation of the list?

[19:42:25] <imode> though I guess you'd rather have the tick count and extrapolate from there based on clocks per second...
[19:42:33] <imode> that's more precise.
[19:42:36] <imode> maybe.
[19:42:48] * imode makes a note of that.
[19:42:50] <riv> btw, sounds cool - what kind of timing attack are you doing?
[19:42:55] <rtpg> I think for my use case I'm not even that interested in the count in seconds, just want some reference to compare stuff with
[19:43:35] <riv> https://easyperf.net/blog/2019/08/02/Perf-measurement-environment-on-Linux some of these tips may help reduce noise in your measurements
[19:44:14] <rtpg> thinking of writing a really basic sample program to do the whole "variable time string comparisons for passwords is bad" dance. To be honest I couldn't get a basic example of a python script working, which got me to wondering "is this even a viable attack in The Real World???"

[19:45:48] <rtpg> I'm very allergic to security theater/urban legends like "they can recover your disk if you write all zeros", and like... given how much noise happens over a network and even just in a CPython execution environment.... I imagine it's possible in an extremely constrained environment though
[19:46:02] <riv> "they can recover your disk if you write all zeros", <-- yeah, this one is false, but people still say it
[19:46:31] <riv> i have occasionally seen people saying they did it over the actual internet
[19:46:36] <imode> wonder how much of that is true for SSDs.
[19:46:40] <riv> but it requires hours of logging to reduce the noise down
[19:46:54] <rtpg> Tho tbh this might mostly be dumb guy confidence and like... statistics might work or something
[19:46:56] <riv> if i understand correctly,  you can't overwrite a file on an SSD
[19:47:11] <imode> if that's the case then where's my space going.
[19:47:13] <riv> if you try to, it just writes the new data elsewhere
[19:47:23] <riv> and it points the file to this new location
[19:47:35] <mgdm> Timing attacks across networks do happen, given enough data and stats, there was one in OpenSSH https://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2016/Jul/51
[19:47:37] <riv> the data may eventually be overwritten when you fill the disk completely
[19:47:51] <Brekkjern> Or when trim is done
[19:47:58] <rtpg> just... mathematically if you have "network noise" >>> "string comparison changes" seems hard to separate one from the other
[19:48:10] <imode> that doesn't really make sense, it's trivial to generate enough data to fill a disk twice over.
[19:48:18] <imode> and delete it all.

[19:49:12] <riv> rtpg, yeah, that's why it can take days of averaging - I suppose there are levels where it's not even possible to recovr
[19:49:35] <rtpg> @mgdm that timing attack is for detecting only 1 of 2 states though. You're not in the "oh we are able to reverse the password cuz you used non-const-time string comparisons" stuff that people say is possible
[19:49:42] <imode> really though, what're the odds of forensic analysis recovering deleted data on SSDs when TRIM is done.
[19:50:06] <riv> rtpg, will you memoserv me with an update on this? :D
[19:50:09] <rtpg> thanks for the link though! I like having this kind of reference and I will try to dig around for similar stuff though
[19:50:12] <Brekkjern> Most SSDs have a reserved area to use instead of sectors that are unwriteable. If the data you really want to delete is in those areas that are unwriteable, then you can't actually delete it.
[19:50:54] <riv> btw another really intersting one is power consumption side channel

[19:51:39] <riv> :D
[19:51:44] <Brekkjern> Not joking...
[19:51:44] <imode> that doesn't seem like a fair thing, though.
[19:52:01] <imode> why use SSDs then if security is a factor.
[19:52:38] <Brekkjern> Well, you could always encrypt at rest, and have an easily destructible storage medium for the key
[19:52:57] <Brekkjern> That might be good enough
[19:53:00] <kline> *swaps*
[19:53:00] <mgdm> rtpg: there’s this one too where they recovered an RSA private key across a campus network, which is a relatively controlled environment but it’s enough to make me assume people who really want to do that will be able to https://crypto.stanford.edu/~dabo/papers/ssl-timing.pdf
[19:53:38] <imode> man, security is whack.
[19:53:43] <Brekkjern> Yes
[19:53:46] <riv> i like that idea, separete the FDE header off onto a removable stick
[19:53:51] <riv> then your SSD just has random noise on it
[19:53:51] <mgdm> Where I work secure destruction of SSDs is assumed to involve shredding them to a particular particle size
[19:53:52] <imode> guess I gotta go throw my SSDs into a furnace.
[19:54:02] <wrl> securely wipe an SSD by having used full disk encryption from the beginning
[19:54:05] <Brekkjern> mgdm: That is the way
[19:54:14] <riv> mgdm, using acid?
[19:54:22] <Brekkjern> No, grinder.
[19:54:34] <kline> remember to disable swap if you care about this
[19:54:36] <riv> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLpSapjKcxM this stuff looks good for it
[19:54:39] <Brekkjern> Just gotta ensure the chips that come out the other side are small enoguh to not contain intact NAND cells
[19:54:47] <imode> kline: I've got swap on my SSD.
[19:54:52] <rtpg> oh that ssl timing paper is exactly what I was looking for, thanks mgdm
[19:54:54] <imode> am I boned.
[19:55:01] <kline> having your data encrypted at rest but then decrypted into ram and swapping it back onto the SSD defeats the point
[19:55:16] <letoram> thanks to cloud/iot you have enough options for pivoting networks if the noise between the source and the one you are attacking exceeds the available timing source precision/accuracy if timing attacks are really your pivot of choice ..
[19:55:42] <Brekkjern> kline: Not if you do HW encryption
[19:55:47] <letoram> as to the other practicality of timing attacks, still the first thing I try when I run into a 'protected' jtag or stupid stuff like that
[19:55:48] <Brekkjern> But it's still dumb
[19:56:05] <imode> why the hell are SSDs the "norm" now if any kind of security involving them involves hucking them against a grinder.
[19:56:17] <riv> letoram, oh you're attacking hw directly?
[19:56:18] <chancee> presumeably drilling a matrix of holes through an SSD would make recovery too difficult? Rather than us buying furnaces and vats of acid :)
[19:56:27] <letoram> see also: how the gamecube was broken into
[19:56:30] <kline> Brekkjern, kind of, depends on where you end up storing the key
[19:56:41] <mgdm> riv: a machine of some kind they bring in from time to time. I am not involved in the process, I’m just aware that it exists
[19:56:41] <Brekkjern> Why are we discussing this? What nation states are you trying to protect your data from?
[19:56:48] <imode> idfk.
[19:57:00] <imode> but SSDs seem wasteful. :\
[19:57:21] <Brekkjern> They are more difficult to recycle, so I guess?
[19:57:26] <mgdm> letoram: was that to do with undervolting things? Or am I thinking of something else?
[19:57:31] <letoram> have had several red team victories on side-channel analysis of rdp / vnc .. people only type so fast, when a keypress becomes a packet you can encrypt all you want
[19:57:43] <riv> hehe
[19:57:48] <letoram> mhdm: vcc glitching was a few other platforms, gameboy color rom extraction being a great one
[19:58:01] <kline> chancee, easiest is to nip to your local hardware place and rent a grinder/fixed sander and just feed the m.2 card into it
[19:58:22] <letoram> fill memory with nop sled, jmp at end to your readout code, glitch vcc and reset hoping that the pc randomizes to your sled before bios protected itself
[19:58:36] <mgdm> letoram: ah cool, I remembered it being used on something Nintendo
[20:01:27] <letoram> there's rather recent victories in the arcade emulation scene on even crazier stuff - https://mamedev.emulab.it/haze/2019/11/27/thank-you-morten-kirkegaard/ .. too bad there won't be a technical writeup of it
[20:01:47] <mgdm> imode: I have swap on a couple of machines on SSDs but it’s encrypted the same way as the root FS. Might be wasteful somehow but it does work

[23:26:30] <earthy> 5.25" floppies contained 360K and 3.5" floppies were twice the size, minimum; double that if you had HD, which virtually everyone did.
[23:27:16] <companion_cube> msmith12[m]: boo no generics
[23:27:27] <msmith12[m]> Eaiser to make compiler for
[23:27:34] <msmith12[m]> my friend is thinking of making hare compiler
[23:27:35] <companion_cube> Who cares
[23:28:02] <c355e3b> If you need something simple to compile, Oberon is always there
[23:28:15] <c355e3b> Things need to be usable to be useful
[23:28:20] <c355e3b> and baring that, at least be entertaining
[23:28:24] <klardotsh> looks like the language introduction isn't fleshed out yet so I won't make too many judgements yet. I'll be interested to see how it stacks up to Zig, they seem to be aiming for the same market
[23:28:31] <companion_cube> It's like ditching Linux for your home grown kernel
[23:28:38] <companion_cube> Fun, but not practical
[23:29:00] <companion_cube> klardotsh: I fail to see any way in which hare will be better than zig
[23:29:53] <bsandro> i might be wrong but don't see how is it better than plain old C since same alloc/free
[23:30:04] <companion_cube> Also "lol no hashtable, you can write your own shitty one in 20 lines"
[23:30:37] <epilys> things don't have to be practical, though I agree with the criticisms here. ddevault is always a hipster of his own
[23:30:41] <ngoldbaum> companion_cube: writing your own hash table is the best part of programminh
[23:30:49] <companion_cube> Ddevault is just wanking on some K&R fetish
[23:30:59] <companion_cube> ngoldbaum: assuming you only need one 😂
[23:31:14] <sklv1> i think every project has to start somewhere, drew's done quite a few projects from zero to usable
[23:31:23] <msmith12[m]> Only time can tell
[23:31:32] <sklv1> but yea i really can't get excited about manual memory management
[23:31:35] <epilys> " This project is under active development" and a paragraph later: "It is well-suited to writing operating systems, system tools, compilers, networking software, and other low-level, high performance tasks. "
[23:31:50] <epilys> I guess it is Turing complete then?
[23:31:52] <sklv1> i agree with his criticisms of rust, but surely if you're making a language you'd take the good bits and leave the bad
[23:32:16] <imode> ddevault seems to be a well-hated figure around these parts.
[23:32:34] <ngoldbaum> instead you don’t and then flame people on their projects’ github issues
[23:32:34] <epilys> He's a rant-driven disruptive persona
[23:32:43] <c355e3b> Devault has thrown a lot at lobste.rs
[23:32:44] <earthy> hm. making a systems language in this day and age and *not* being explicit about threading seems silly.
[23:32:51] <imode> neat.
[23:32:56] <companion_cube> epilys: wow very good description
[23:33:02] <imode> carry on. :P
[23:33:04] <sklv1> disruptive?! he's contributed loads of stuff
[23:33:18] <klardotsh> seems to fit into the "it's a slightly improved C" niche well, which was something he pretty publicly appreciated about Go, so I guess it seems about right that this is, so far, reading to me as C with a more modernly-familiar printf, match statements, and a (seemingly) more robust type system
[23:33:24] <imode> do tell.
[23:33:27] <c355e3b> contributions have no bearing on disruptions
[23:33:28] *** Quits: brumbo (~korowiow@89-70-222-177.dynamic.chello.pl) (Quit: Leaving)
[23:33:40] <c355e3b> earthy: you ever look at strand?
[23:33:47] <companion_cube> sklv1: I can see where he dislikes rust, but his dismissal of Zig is just ridiculous
[23:33:53] <sklv1> he's made a window manager, and an alternative to github, which are both very nontrivial
[23:33:54] <msmith12[m]> ddevault is provactive on purpose
[23:33:55] <companion_cube> "oh no generics"
[23:34:04] <ngoldbaum> does sourcehut deal with html email yet?
[23:34:16] <c355e3b> zero control over threads, but a really interesting parallel programing environment (http://www.call-with-current-continuation.org/strand/strand.html)
[23:34:18] <companion_cube> Making sourcehut doesn't mean he has good taste in PL design :)
[23:34:42] <epilys> for what it's worth, I tried self hosting sourcehut and it was a terrible experience setting it up
[23:34:56] <imode> "strand is written in forth" c355e3b, a user after my own heart.
[23:35:09] <ngoldbaum> epilys: better or worse than, say, gitlab or gitea?
[23:35:14] <c355e3b> I'm really wanting to do my own impl of it at some point
[23:35:15] <companion_cube> klardotsh: more modern type system that doesn't have generics is just... No
[23:35:18] <c355e3b> so I can weave in a better debugger
[23:35:19] <sklv1> companion_cube: sure, I think the lang has like no use case, but I am sure grateful he exists, even though I don't agree with lots of things he says
[23:35:21] <epilys> ngoldbaum, gitea is just a static binary
[23:35:34] <companion_cube> He has some good takes outside of PL design :p
[23:35:42] <companion_cube> But he's also often a raging asshole, so...
[23:35:50] <sklv1> ngoldbaum: sourcehut does a lot more than gitea though
[23:36:01] <sklv1> yea i agree the self hosting experience didn't look great
[23:36:09] <imode> that's nuts.
[23:36:20] <sklv1> but then again, the self hosting experience for gitlab for example is also terrible
[23:36:25] <epilys> gitea is rather limited
[23:36:32] <c355e3b> Gitlab does give you a single debain package
[23:36:34] <c355e3b> it just falls over
[23:36:44] <ngoldbaum> this was pretty beyond the pale https://github.com/pyca/cryptography/issues/5771#issuecomment-775972877
[23:36:53] <epilys> gitlab requires javascript for some reason, I find this design decision offputting
[23:36:58] <ngoldbaum> no one should take him seriously after that interaction
[23:37:10] <imode> epilys: gitweb will serve you well.
[23:37:21] <klardotsh> companion_cube: I agree that it's "no" but I mean, again, it's consistent with Go in that regard (which is, IMO, one of the most infuriating design decisions of Go and led me to hate maintaining or building anything in Go pretty quickly)
[23:37:36] <c355e3b> also, who in their right mind supports s390x?
[23:37:38] <klardotsh> companion_cube: so this seems to be exactly the language I'd expect it to be given the author
[23:37:40] <imode> "You're right - I don't take your research seriously?" this dude is a fuck.
[23:37:43] <c355e3b> if you aren't me, you don't need to
[23:37:45] <companion_cube> ngoldbaum: a little while after a blog post "be nice to OSS maintainers"
[23:37:59] <imode> "be nice to me"
[23:38:07] <ngoldbaum> companion_cube: they broke his CI which is a war crime
[23:38:08] <epilys> i.e "give attention"
[23:38:13] <companion_cube> klardotsh: for sure. Not sure why other people are interested though.
[23:38:21] <imode> joy..
[23:38:38] <companion_cube> c355e3b: well you need support for etc passwd in your stdlib
[23:38:46] <companion_cube> More important than hashtables
[23:38:55] <sklv1> if that counts as being "not nice" then I'm at a loss. he's fully entitled to his opinion including not taking someone's research seriously, at worst, he's been brief
[23:39:00] <companion_cube> Same for crazy niche platforms
[23:39:12] <companion_cube> sklv1: he's insulting and entitled
[23:39:17] <imode> and outdated.
[23:39:18] <msmith12[m]> Oh yeah i forgot that it doesnt support windows or mac os
[23:39:21] <companion_cube> Just what he's advocating not to be
[23:39:22] <imode> and I say this as a forth user.
[23:39:27] <msmith12[m]> THe language is dead on arrival unless someone fixes that
[23:39:53] <msmith12[m]> Linux is great, I use it, but literally 90% of people have a windows or mac or iPhone device
[23:40:05] <z3t0> Is gitweb similar to cgit?
[23:40:09] <msmith12[m]> I guess its great for servers and stuff, but theres no way it will be taken seriously for client side apps
[23:40:18] <imode> z3t0: https://git-scm.com/docs/gitweb
[23:40:30] <epilys> imode, what's the most complex stuff you've written in forth? I'm genuinely interested, it's such an unfamiliar PL
[23:40:51] <z3t0> neat!, imode
[23:40:52] <companion_cube> msmith12[m]: but but one floppy disk
[23:41:03] <imode> z3t0: examples of it at https://git.imode.tech
[23:41:14] <rwb>  i can't believe i used to complain this much about other people and the things they do lol
[23:41:34] <epilys> complain is 95% of human experience
[23:41:34] <imode> epilys: the most complex stuff would probably be an operating environment for a medical device.
[23:41:45] <epilys> imode, wow! that sounds great
[23:41:50] <msmith12[m]> Say what you want about the language, it looks intresting to me imho, but it will get nowhere without windows and mac support
[23:42:26] <ngoldbaum> sort of like a code forge operated via email but definitely not html email
[23:42:29] <msmith12[m]> I assume someone will have some unofficial fork that adds win and darwin support, or  he will cave in
[23:43:05] <imode> epilys: it was pretty nice, you could host the dev environment on the actual device, but of course we just had something more minimal by the time it went to mass production.
[23:43:17] <klardotsh> msmith12[m]: wait does the site say it doesn't ever plan to support darwin or does it just not support it for now? I have to imagine he knows it'll be DOA without that...
[23:43:26] <imode> really tiny thing, at that.
[23:43:37] <epilys> imode, oof I want to learn details but I don't want to trouble you :p
[23:43:38] <klardotsh> but I can see punting that to later when you're just getting the start of stuff off the ground. seems like a reasonable thing to delay.
[23:43:48] <msmith12[m]> klardotsh: https://harelang.org/platforms/
[23:43:50] <msmith12[m]> "Hare does not, and will not, support any proprietary operating systems.'
[23:43:51] <imode> epilys: https://www.obimed.com/etfmx/
[23:44:07] <msmith12[m]> Now darwin is unix based so it would be fairly straightforward
[23:44:08] <imode> basically a glorified vibrator.
[23:44:11] <msmith12[m]> But windows support is a must
[23:44:14] <klardotsh> oh lol. yeah, RIP then, Zig will eat the marketshare in that space.
[23:44:23] <ngoldbaum> so it would support macs in the way emacs does: badly
[23:44:27] <epilys> imode, what microcontroller?
[23:44:32] <imode> epilys: some tiny AVR thing.
[23:44:43] <epilys> aah ok the forth makes sense then
[23:44:49] <z3t0> emacs on mac works fine? ngoldbaum
[23:45:04] <z3t0> Or maybe I used a fork/community maintained patch...
[23:45:15] <ngoldbaum> there’s a boatload of patches that fixes a bunch of stuff emacs upstream refuses to take because they’d break darwin or whatever
[23:45:24] <imode> it was useful to have an actual "dev environment" on the MCU (or something similar) because we actually needed to tune the curve.
[23:45:33] <sklv1> companion_cube: entitled maybe (subjective) insulting, I don't buy. I don't see what's wrong with ranting. Moden technology is increasingly user hostile, and calling it out is part of the solution
[23:45:44] <epilys> imode, why not C?
[23:45:47] <imode> so we'd get acceleration values from several fake "feet" with actual bones of varying bone densities.
[23:46:04] <imode> epilys: mostly for fun. secondly because I could reprogram the thing without having a programmer.
[23:46:29] <imode> it was about as "rapid development" as you could get it.
[23:46:30] <epilys> sounds very fun indeed
[23:46:51] <z3t0> ngoldbaum: they refuse to accept patches that would break darwin? Or the patches would fix them? just to make sure i read that right haha
[23:47:03] <imode> you'd take a measurement from an actual tuning fork, plug in some values from the measurement equipment, then test to see whether those values equated to the right curve on your device.
[23:47:38] <epilys> are tuning forks expensive? always wanted one
[23:47:44] <imode> yeah.
[23:47:45] <sklv1> epilys: not really
[23:47:53] <imode> ones used in diagnosing neuropathy are.
[23:48:08] <ngoldbaum> they refuse to take the patches because emacs officially supports darwin, despite ~0 people using darwin
[23:48:14] <epilys> if it's just sensation why would you need something sophisticated?
[23:48:18] <ngoldbaum> so this exists: https://bitbucket.org/mituharu/emacs-mac/src/master/
[23:48:34] <imode> milliseconds matter.
[23:48:34] <sklv1> wait, diagnose neuropathy with a tuning fork?! brb ddg
[23:48:59] <epilys> imode, btw I'm asking with genuine curiosity if that's not clear
[23:49:01] <imode> I didn't think it mattered either, but we also had to machine a special tip.
[23:49:14] <imode> that didn't dampen any of the actual vibrations coming from the motor.
[23:49:42] <z3t0> ah interesting, and darwin=mac? or is darwin something else
[23:49:43] <epilys> So you have to make sure the vibration is actually felt if the patient is able to feel it
[23:49:52] <imode> that's correct, and it has to be at the correct frequency.
[23:49:57] <imode> 128hz and 256hz.
[23:49:57] <ngoldbaum> if you’re using emacs on a mac and aren’t using something based on mituharu’s fork you’ll get a subpar experience and emacs upstream doesn’t gaf for political reasons
[23:49:58] <epilys> makes sense
[23:50:07] <sklv1> looks like $20 for the neuropathy one
[23:50:10] <imode> if you're "out of tune", it doesn't matter much if you're a fraction of a hz off.
[23:50:24] <imode> sklv1: BOM for ours is $3.
[23:50:34] <imode> or the projected one was at their manufacturing scale..
[23:50:47] <imode> man that was almost 8 years ago.
[23:51:19] <z3t0> ngoldbaum ah i see, kinda wish it wasnt the case but oh well
[23:51:41] <ngoldbaum> so like that’s what devault wants for hare
[23:51:52] <ngoldbaum> iconoclast’s gonna iconoclast
[23:52:03] <indigo> Shhh, Hare isn't ready, we can't talk about it
[23:52:27] <imode> what's funny is that the hunk of PCB metal and ICs with a machined tip is cheaper to produce and sell than the one that's all-metal but requires specific machining.
[23:52:34] <imode> you also don't have to tune ours.
[23:52:48] <imode> I say "ours", I haven't worked with O'Brien Medical since I stopped teaching lmao.
[23:52:58] <epilys> https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32796809441.html
[23:53:01] <epilys> this one has different colors
[23:53:13] <imode> I want mine lime green.
[23:53:23] <imode> "sound healing therapy".. yeah that sounds quality.
[23:53:25] <epilys> (the colors are actually the frequency choices)
[23:53:32] <epilys> I wonder how crappy is it
[23:53:43] <imode> I'm tempted to dig out the fake foot and buy one.
[23:53:44] <epilys> medical stuff on aliexpress is always fun to look at
[23:53:56] <imode> still have my "trophy" with the zip-tied accelerometer on the big toe.
[23:54:16] <imode> fun fact: you can't use yourself to test it.
[23:54:19] <imode> like legally.
