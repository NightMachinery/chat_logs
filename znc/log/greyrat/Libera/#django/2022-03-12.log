[04:03:22] <jim> hi, been looking for a point in the corey schafer video tutorial where I lose my form field error messages that come up as a result of submitting some bad values in a form, and I think I found at least one point:
[04:06:29] <jim> there is a place where he has us make a users/forms.py file, and put a form class that inherits from django.contrib.auth.forms.UserCreationForm, to add an email field to the existing username, password1 and password2 ("put same password again") fields, we call that class UserRegisterForm.
[04:07:42] *** Joins: shangxiao (~davids@101.165.217.11)
[04:08:15] <jim> when I use UserCreationForm (the one that comes with django.contrib), I get error messages. when I use UserRegisterForm (the one I defined in users/forms.py), no error messages.
[04:08:37] <jim> what happened? want to see forms.py? views?
[04:16:20] *** Joins: Kalov (~Thunderbi@181.226.96.240)
[04:22:33] <jim> this is weird... when I use values that were present on the form before changing the view to use UserRegisterForm, I get errors... but if I do the GET request to the register page, which makes a blank form, I fill it out with all bad values (unmatching passwords, username having inva, lid username characters, invalid email addresses), I dont get errors at the fields, and the server doesn't show a log of the POST request for the form

[05:37:53] <FunkyBob> jim: in your custom form do you specify a class Meta: for it?
[05:44:46] <jim> yes
[05:45:02] <jim> I'll show it to you, gimme a few secs
[05:49:22] <jim> ok,
[05:50:26] <jim> the repo is at https://github.com/jwlynch/django-vid-coreyshafer.git
[05:52:44] <jim> the new class is in django_project/users/forms.py. the view for that form is the register func in users/views.py
[05:57:27] <FunkyBob> https://github.com/django/django/blob/main/django/contrib/auth/forms.py#L84
[05:57:51] <FunkyBob> so, this is the class you're extending
[05:58:46] <FunkyBob> looking at your view, it looks ok... though convention is to have the if/else the other way, but that's not matter
[05:58:52] <FunkyBob> s/not/no/
[05:59:39] <FunkyBob> jim: https://github.com/jwlynch/django-vid-coreyshafer/blob/master/django_project/users/templates/users/register.html#L4
[05:59:44] <FunkyBob> your form has no action

[06:03:18] <FunkyBob> TIL method="dialog" is a thing https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/form#attr-method
[06:04:51] <FunkyBob> does your browser show it's trying to POST?
[06:05:08] <FunkyBob> if not, _try_ setting an action
[06:05:22] <jim> I dunno how it would show that
[06:05:34] <FunkyBob> inspect element -> select Network tab...
[06:08:36] <jim> here is the path for it: path('register/', user_views.register, name="register")
[06:09:00] <jim> can I figure an action url for it from that?
[06:09:24] <jim> (that's from the root urlConf)
[06:09:40] <FunkyBob> {% url 'register' %}

[06:14:59] <jim> well the form looks ok

[06:17:07] <jim> oh, let me reload the form from the beginning
[06:17:08] *** Joins: Kalov (~Thunderbi@181.226.96.240)
[06:17:16] <FunkyBob> the number of times I've been helping people and they realise they're editing the wrong file...
[06:17:22] <FunkyBob> [or that I've done that myself]
[06:18:32] <FunkyBob> indeed, always hard refresh after a change
[06:21:45] <jim> all reloaded, log doesn't (still) show a POST after I hit the submit
[06:21:53] <FunkyBob> and the browser?
[06:22:56] <FunkyBob> do you know how to access your browsers Inspector?
[06:22:56] <jim> take awhile to look at that
[06:23:09] <jim> I don't
[06:23:29] <jim> so I'll look at a blank form first
[06:23:30] <FunkyBob> most browsers offer an "Inspect Element" in a context menu
[06:23:57] <jim> right click pulldown?
[06:24:01] <FunkyBob> yes
[06:24:22] <FunkyBob> alternatively, Chrome as the ... menu, then More Tools, and in there Developer Tools
[06:25:05] <FunkyBob> once you've opened that (it typically starts on the DOM + CSS view) you can switch to the Network tab
[06:25:05] <jim> in firefox, found the menu item you're talking about (and, still looking at page source of form)
[06:25:43] <FunkyBob> there's a Network tab in FF, too... icon is up/down arrows
[06:25:54] <FunkyBob> once there, press the submit button, see what shows, if anything
[06:25:58] <jim> can I bump the font of that? (and of atom's menus)
[06:26:09] <FunkyBob> probably
[06:26:25] <FunkyBob> ctrl-mousewheel is resizing the font in FF for me...
[06:26:51] <jim> of the inspec ctor stuff?
[06:27:02] <FunkyBob> yes, when it's focused
[06:28:39] <jim> ok, got the network tab
[06:30:15] <jim> network tab says no requests
[06:30:23] <FunkyBob> so, the form isn't submitting for some reason

[10:02:26] <dre> Hey guys, does anyone know how model inheritance works?
[10:03:36] <dre> so I have like, say "album" that has a collection of "assets" like photos, etc,
[10:04:27] <dre> can I make an Asset Model, that has the important things ( title, datetime) --- but then be like Image(Asset) and Video(Asset) and MultiImage(Asset) ?
[10:05:15] <dre> hmm nvm I'll think about it more
[10:13:43] <jim> one thing, what are you looking to do, especially with these three inheriting models?

[10:15:56] <jim> also, if you have the three assets separately available from the Asset model, you might not need the other models, just use Asset, and the code of each thing should be concerned with one asset
[10:26:16] <jim> if you really want the extra classes, to "enforce" just having the one kind of asset, then you need to figure out what method to override, to only provide the one kind of asset named by its class

[10:50:42] <jim> most likely, the method you would override, is the one that provides an enumeration of all the assets... and what the enumerated method does instead, is somehow provide a subset of all the assets, maybe by filtering, or maybe some other way
[10:52:00] <jim> so Asset would define a method that provides a list of all the assets, while each subclass overrides that method, so it provides only the assets of the kind named by its class
[10:53:30] <jim> and so, when you have an Asset or Asset subclass, you don't care, because you just use that method to get whatever assets it decides to give yoiu

[13:50:57] <jim> FunkyBob, here's the form subclass, with the Meta class in it: https://termbin.com/6ulh
[13:55:29] <jim> to anyone else who would like to take a look, this is a subclass of UserCreationForm that adds an email field and specifies an ordering of fields, using a Meta class defined inside the subclass. This is also why I'd like to find a doc to read that explains how a Meta class might influence the class as a whole.

[17:13:02] <yanchai> earlier it was the missing data formmanagement was missing
[17:13:29] <yanchai> now its ok but my declaration form requires user which is the only field in the form and is a foreignkey user_id
[17:14:14] <yanchai> how do i set it or initialize it so that the form will get the current user and declaration_form.is_valid() will return true?
[17:14:46] <yanchai> for now when i submit the form it returns an error user is required
[17:14:53] <GinFuyou> user doesn't have to be set to validate the form
[17:15:16] <yanchai> but the formset i have containes 2 forms declaration and checklist
[17:15:52] <GinFuyou> You should not pass user in POST because it can be forged, so if it's only field in declaration you don't need a form for it at all
[17:15:54] <yanchai> and to have the instance in my checklist i need to pass the declaration form current user field
[17:16:08] <yanchai> checklist = formset(data, request.POST, prefix='question_fs', instance=declaration)
[17:16:46] <yanchai> and i cant set the declaration_form.user = request.user since it returns false in the validation
[17:17:07] <GinFuyou> jsut create declaration manually in the view as you did and remove the form (if there no other fields except user to pass)
[17:18:13] <yanchai> do i need to refactor my formset?
[17:18:21] <yanchai> formset = inlineformset_factory(Declaration, Checklist, form=ChecklistForm, fk_name='declaration')

[17:58:58] <GinFuyou> yanchai, what happens? formset doesn't pass validation? If so, what are errors?
[17:59:29] <yanchai> what happens now is it creates a declaration object but the checklist is ignored or not executed, if i add save(commit=False) it shows an error since i am not using declaration_form
[18:00:15] <yanchai> no error it creates the object and ignore the checklist
[18:00:15] <GinFuyou> I don't think instance.save() has "commit" argument, it's for form.save()
[18:00:36] <yanchai> oh ok
[18:04:18] <yanchai> GinFuyou: and now ManagementForm error is back
[18:04:33] <yanchai> i placed this inside my template declaration = Declaration() declaration.user = request.user
[18:04:42] <yanchai> wrong typo
[18:05:00] <yanchai> i placed this inside my template {{ question_formset.management_form }} and removed the data in my formset

[18:11:56] <yanchai> GinFuyou: on my views?
[18:12:16] <GinFuyou> line 7 sets `question_fs` and line 32 sets `questionS_fs`
[18:12:52] <GinFuyou> that would cause all data on POST to be descarded, since keys do not match

[18:50:40] <yanchai> if i use booleanfield they will just ignore the questions and click submit all will be set to false
[18:51:20] <yanchai> atlease that way the user can't say that they accidentally cliced submit without selecting the answers yes or no
[18:51:23] <GinFuyou> mmm, you mean it prevents empty submits?
[18:51:44] <GinFuyou> pretty sure it can be fixed with boolean field too, but fine I guess
[18:51:46] <yanchai> yes

[18:52:21] <yanchai> even though some of it are yes
