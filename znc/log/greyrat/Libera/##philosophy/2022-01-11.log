[00:00:19] <causative> I don't know what it means to see an object as having essence or self
[00:00:40] *** Joins: CryptoDavid (uid14990@id-14990.uxbridge.irccloud.com)
[00:01:41] <evolv> something that defines a thing, unchanging, stable, that can be eternal or can be annihilated
[00:02:04] <causative> I see objects as being made of mostly atoms, existing as no more or less than a pattern of atoms and particles
[00:02:16] <causative> is this "essence" or "self"?
[00:02:24] <evolv> to put in another way, the biases of our models of reality where we believe the models capture reality as it really is
[00:03:22] <causative> I still don't quite know what you mean
[00:03:57] <evolv> and I am not skilled enough to explain it in a way that is brief and readily understood
[00:04:17] <causative> it sounds like Aristotle's notion of essences
[00:04:21] <causative> which was wrong
[00:04:34] <evolv> something permanent and defining
[00:04:55] <causative> but you said it can be annihilated
[00:04:56] <evolv> and that is rejected in Buddhism because what changes is not something's essence
[00:05:01] <causative> if it's permanent it can't be annihilated
[00:05:09] <evolv> what is permanent may not be eternal
[00:05:18] <evolv> it can be
[00:05:31] <evolv> but the thing is while it exists, it doesn't change
[00:05:46] <evolv> if it no longer exists when it once did, it is annihilated
[00:06:25] <causative> ok, like "the number of current US Presidents" doesn't change, as long as the US has a president
[00:06:37] <causative> is that what you mean?
[00:06:41] <evolv> no
[00:06:50] <causative> in what way is that different from what you mean?
[00:07:09] <evolv> ontology
[00:07:57] <causative> sounds again like you're talking about an Aristotelian worldview where objects exist in their own right with their own separate "essences," which is opposed to a modern reductionist worldview
[00:08:00] <causative> is that what you're saying?
[00:08:38] <causative> like, I would say a glove exists "only as" an arrangement of atoms - Aristotle might say, contradicting me, that the glove has its own essence that defines its existence
[00:09:20] <evolv> yes, exactly that
[00:09:36] <causative> ok, so what about this concept, why are you mentioning it?
[00:11:02] <evolv> it relates back to mental perception of objects you brought up earlier, which I chimed in without having read until later
[00:12:01] <evolv> any perception of an object is due to ignorance of the nature of the object
[00:12:12] <evolv> because objects are empty of essence
[00:12:16] <evolv> "emptiness"
[00:12:29] <evolv> non-essentialism
[00:13:27] <evolv> or if we think of it in the scope of words, how words shape out reality
[00:13:59] <evolv> if we only know the names of a few shades of blue, we cannot perceive the other shades of blue
[00:14:07] <evolv> that gets into blue-ness
[00:14:39] <evolv> but if we see more shades of blue, that is still because of our limited understanding of reality as it is
[00:14:52] <evolv> and I think you were touching on that subject

[00:17:36] <causative> I guess.  Or rather, what I would say about essence is that it doesn't exist as a separate thing - the nature of a thing is as pattern of smaller things, and this "pattern" isn't a fundamental thing itself
[00:17:55] *** Quits: mannequin (uid453465@id-453465.helmsley.irccloud.com) (Quit: Connection closed for inactivity)
[00:18:08] <causative> we could say things have a nature or a definition, but it's not a separate, fundamental physical thing, it's an abstraction
[00:19:31] <evolv> is it smaller things all the way down?
[00:19:46] <causative> there may be a smallest thing
[00:19:51] <causative> quark or string or something
[00:20:01] <evolv> so if something is permanent, unconditioned, that is an essence
[00:20:19] <causative> well, that may be so then
[00:20:27] <causative> for only the fundamental building blocks of reality
[00:21:47] <evolv> this is no longer in the realm of Buddhism, by the way. But something is unconditioned that is permanent, doesn't change, and that is something, like a particle or wave to you
[00:23:07] <causative> well, a particular particle changes its position, a particular wave changes in a lot of ways
[00:23:51] <causative> a wave is more of a composite, abstract object, more like a chair, not a fundamental element
[00:24:29] <causative> "the value of the wavefunction at a particular position" however could be fundamental - though it does change over time
[00:24:59] <evolv> tjeu
[00:25:03] <evolv> they're all abstractions
[00:25:23] <evolv> we don't actually know the most fundamental "stuff"
[00:25:48] <causative> doesn't mean we'll never find it out

[14:18:15] <Lumine> It's about an engineer who lived in the early 1900s, his name was B. Fuller. His main economic success came from the invention of the geodecic dome but more than that, he made some rather interesting remarks and predictions about the development of technology and our place in the world. And he devised this term, 'synergy'.
[14:20:43] <Lumine> What he meant by synergy was this: that any complex organism has as a whole, an intelligent greater than any one of its parts. This was rather a difficult idea to take in, because of the way he applied it to our technology. He was saying that the industrial complex will move on its own in a certain direction, whether we had a say in it or not, and is able to organize our behaviour in a more intelligent way than we can organize it.
[14:22:26] <Lumine> And will by itself cancel the prospects of war. This hasn't happened yet of course, and thus I question the whole premise. Nevertheless, the increasing complexity of the system will leave us feeling like our individual cells feel inside our bodies. This was in essence his prediction.
[14:26:34] <amigojapan> Lumine: nuclear war tho, has not yet happened
[14:28:20] <amigojapan> Survivors bias? Perhaps, on my part
[14:29:32] <Lumine> True, but I wonder the aspect of an organism so great, that the individual will disappear in the end.
[14:30:09] <amigojapan> Ah ok
[14:31:37] <Lumine> This was along the same lines as the concept of the Noosphere, or the global network of information covering the planet. That was De Chardin's idea of a global sphere made of thoughts in essence, that develops on top of the geosphere and biospheres eventually.
[14:32:03] <Lumine> And was the next stage in the planet's evolution

[14:58:09] <thunder> bucky was awesome. he came up with this really interesting engineering principal of "tensegrity". he also had this idea that you can change people's relationship with the world by engineering structures which predispose a certain mode of interaction. basically along the lines of "if you build it they will come", but also they way in which you build it will shape the way people think about their interactions.
[15:00:23] <thunder> the geodesic domes thing was a macroscopic reflection of the his partical physics hypotheses about carbon nano-structures now known as "buckey balls"

[15:44:45] <arryana> i think there should be a percentage cap, as in, the ceo/head of a company can 50 times what their poorest workers do.  but not 150 times or more.
[15:44:59] <arryana> 'spread the success', not 'eat the rich'
[15:45:25] <arryana> can make, that is
[15:46:14] <pussipupu> The most powerful oligarchs need holding up account though, not just taxation but restriction of the ability to wield unaccountable power
[15:46:17] <thunder> we're already seeing that because of the corporate takeover of food production by pharmaceuticals companies. they create the problem by flooding local markets with subsidized produce, then once the traditional farmers have been forced out of the market by inability to sell their produce, they step in with the "solution" in the form of their gmo bullcrap. for example, millet farming in india being replaced with rice farming which is environmentally
[15:46:17] <thunder> and culturally inappropriate to the region, but creates a perfect excuse to sell "golden rice" to make up for the nutritional deficiencies the industrial ag companies and their political cronies created in the first place.
[15:46:37] <arryana> i like your thinking, pussipupu
[15:48:06] <arryana> i also think that vanity projects by the extremely wealthy should have to be equally matched by donations to existing -real- charities.
[15:48:25] <thunder> the system cannot be reformed because our current forms of government are fundamentally based on extortion tactics. so long as that remains true, any pretnse of reform is just lipstick on a pig
[15:48:44] <arryana> if musk wants to spend however many billions going to mars, great.  and to do that he should have to expend an equal amount to do lasting good on earth.
[15:54:03] <pussipupu> Honestly billionaires shouldn't be a thing to start with
[15:54:12] <pussipupu> That much power is corrosive
[15:54:24] <arryana> yeah
[15:55:28] <arryana> you coukldn
[15:55:38] <pussipupu> But short of massive supra- and anti-national solidarity movements and equally massive developments of dual power I don't see any path there
[15:55:41] <arryana> couldn't pay me enough to be a multi-millianaire, as it were
[15:55:59] <arryana> i would never want that much responsiblility
[15:56:02] <pussipupu> and I don't see any plausible path to those things...
[15:56:32] <arryana> unfortunately, historically such imbalances are 'corrected' with the collapse of whatever society supports them

[20:21:44] <evolv> well, maybe not. It all depends on manufacture and disposal of kitty litter
[20:22:37] <evolv> but there are neat kitty litter boxes that reduce smell, and if you want to pay the price, do the sifting and bagging
[20:22:44] <audrey> I´m too much of a neat freak to actually have a pet
[20:22:50] <audrey> Also, they´re expensive and require too much care for me
[20:22:54] <pussipupu> Not if you run the toilet flush on grey water
[20:22:54] <audrey> (this is also why I don´t have kids)
[20:22:58] <pussipupu> not that I do...
[20:23:06] <evolv> the latter is true, audrey, but cats are clean pets
[20:23:18] <evolv> the major issue is them walking on kitchen countertops
[20:24:20] <evolv> other than vet bills, cats aren't expensive
[20:24:22] <audrey> I´m grossed out enough by my own waste, having to clean up after another animal´s waste is not really my idea of fun
[20:24:25] <evolv> cat food and toys are cheap
[20:24:31] <audrey> And veterinarians can be expensive around here. :x
[20:25:03] <evolv> audrey, kitty litter is magic. I'd use it for myself if my wife permitted
[20:25:37] <evolv> keep kitty litter around without a cat. It's great for cleaning (just never use it on carpet)
[20:26:57] <arryana> they dont seem like much work to me
