[06:41:40] <rdrg109> [Q] Given that Emacs is single threaded, would it be wise to define a global variable and use that variable for temporary operations within simple functions? This to avoid memory allocations through "let" within simple functions.
[06:41:55] <aidalgol> rdrg109: That sounds like a terrible idea.

[06:45:13] <rdrg109> aidalgol: So, I'm using org-roam and I have 3740 nodes. When showing the completion list of all the nodes. I use a FILTER-FN with org-roam-node-find to list some nodes that meet a condition. The FILTER-FN has a let, so that let is executed for each node and that increases the running time of org-roam-node-find.
[06:48:11] <rdrg109> FILTER-FN is a lambda. You can see the sexp here: http://0x0.st/-E3N.el

[11:09:05] <e3d3> multiple files
[11:09:54] <thblt> You'll need to unload or eval them all.  
[11:10:06] <e3d3> I guess so
[11:10:51] <thblt> But it also depends on what you've modified. If it's macros, you may need to reload more than you've changed.
[11:11:27] <e3d3> hmm
[11:12:48] <e3d3> when using unload-feature it tells me that treemacs also depends on treemacs.elc. I didn't modify treemacs.el but also thought that if I did, it automatically recompile to the newest version.
[11:12:49] <thblt> Usually when playing with elisp, it's a good idea to eval (C-x C-e or C-M-x) the forms you've changed, so your changes take effect immediately.
[11:13:18] <e3d3> that was exactly what I learned today
[11:13:23] <e3d3> was = is
[11:13:25] <thblt> No it doesn't. 
[11:14:01] *** beaky_ is now known as beaky
[11:14:09] <e3d3> and when I delete/backup the elc files ?
[11:14:12] <thblt> There are packages to recompile automatically though.  With base emacs, the best you can have is ,,dv load-prefer-newer  
[11:14:12] <fsbot> Non-nil means ‘load’ prefers the newest version of a file.
[11:14:12] <fsbot> This applies when a filename suffix is not explicitly specified and
[11:14:12] <fsbot> ‘load’ is trying various possible suffixes (see ‘load-suffixes’ and
[11:14:12] <fsbot> ‘load-file-rep-suffixes’).  Normally, it stops at the first file ;;[ ,more / ,dump]

[12:57:47] <dragestil> hmm ok

[13:15:28] <dragestil> what makes emacs special though in this respect?
[13:15:58] <dragestil> is it because elisp is interpreted, or some other property of the language

[13:18:30] <thblt> Emacs is a single runtime for a dynamic, interpreted language, and it has special built-in facilities to identify the origin of functions and variables.
[13:18:37] <rnkn> dragestil: yes, most software is compiled
[13:18:59] <rnkn> so you can't really make immediate changes the way you can with Emacs
[13:19:10] <thblt> Because its model is Lisp machines, which (IIUC) used the same globally shared interpreter runtime model.
[13:19:20] <dragestil> rnkn: i didn't ask for immediate changes, compiling is fine

[13:20:37] <dragestil> yeah, i can do that with a single program, but i'd like the whole system to be transparent
[13:20:52] <rnkn> I realise you asked for a GNU/linux, but you could also check out the BSDs, which keep their entire source tree altogether
[13:21:09] <dragestil> ok thanks
[13:21:31] <dragestil> thblt: hmm interesting

[18:15:40] <TRS-80> mwnaylor: It's written for Common Lisp but if you never told me that you could easily mistake the examples for Elisp (which is all I know) at least so far.
[18:15:47] <mwnaylor> I have 𝘓𝘢𝘯𝘥 𝘰𝘧 𝘓𝘪𝘴𝘱 hardcopy. It seems more basic.
[18:16:16] <TRS-80> rpav: On Lisp is another one I see recommended even more often, even Let Over Lambda mentions it in fact.
[18:16:27] <mwnaylor> TRS-80: I got the CL focus from the intro. Interested in how it would apply to Elisp or Clojure.
[18:17:16] <TRS-80> mwnaylor: I gather that it is applicable to all Lisps.  As it is about closures and (mainly) macro creation, the "killer feature(s)" of all Lisps.
[18:19:15] <TRS-80> mwnaylor: I kept seeing those 2 books I already mentioned being mentioned by others over and over, so I finally took a look.

[18:27:37] <rpav> but for everything else and most common tasks you really want a real language .. it boggles me how bad like vscode or even atom extensions are and how hard they make adding code
[18:27:53] <TRS-80> Bayes: This may not be applicable to what you are doing, because beancount transactions are separated by newlines which made it easy, but here is an example anyway: https://bpa.st/QBVQ  And that's the next step, start studying similar code, with all the Emacs lookup functionality (on top of a basic understanding) you can very often figure things out.

[18:36:53] <TRS-80> Bayes: BTW that's a very naive function.  For example it only works when point is at beginning of a transaction (or "directive" actually, in Beancount speak).  Also it will eat the transaction if you are at the bottom and try to move it down.  lol  But it's good enough for my own use 99% of the time, and often that's "good enough" for a first pass.

[19:19:07] <dale> If I was starting from nothing today I'd probably use Vertico instead, I bet.  But I'm definitely not starting from nothing.
[19:19:19] <sebboh> Hi.  There is some package altering my 'c-x f' prompt in the minibuffer.  I don't know what it is called.  How may I find out?  I'm using a "distro" of emacs today.  It's called Portacle, and I'm on Windows.  The prompt looks like this: Find file: c:/projects/{project-a/ | project-b | ...}
[19:19:25] <TRS-80> dale: I gather (after watching his videos on the topic) you can achieve most (if not all) the same functionality, but you will need to set it up differently of course and in the process also learn something about native completion along the way
[19:19:52] <dale> sebboh: That smells like ido, try M-x ido-mode RET and see if it says you've disabled ido-mode.  (If it says you enabled it, do M-x ido-mode again.)
[19:20:20] <sebboh> dale: I knew the name of that one and tried disabling it already, but my prompt did not change.
[19:20:27] <dale> TRS-80: I have looked into the mouth of native completion and it brought terror to my soul.
[19:21:07] <dale> sebboh: If you do C-h k C-x C-f, what does help say that C-x C-f is bound to?
[19:21:19] <sebboh> ah good idea

[19:22:20] <codingquark> I am willing to try out Vertico, if it has some appeal
[19:23:00] <codingquark> Ah, a vertical completion UI
[19:24:06] <dale> codingquark: I'm skeptical that Vertico would be any substantial improvement if you've set up Selectrum, but that's just based on me lazily flipping through READMEs.

[20:38:16] <dale> e1f: I think Google Authenticator is notorious for not giving you a way to backup TOTP secrets and I don't recall that having changed in the past... years.  Indeed when you set up 2FA with Google they give you like ten backup codes and tell you to print them out.  If you have something like Gmail app installed you might be able to get a 2FA challenge through that instead of TOTP.
[20:38:35] <dale> ldlework: Yes, I admit, it was a bad joke.  Probably.
[20:38:50] <artefact> you could always backup a picture of the qr code itself?

[20:53:13] <rpav> the issue with backing up 2fa codes is it sortof defeats the point doesn' tit
[20:53:37] <e1f> not if it'a a secure backup
[20:54:26] <technomancy> the point is that stealing your password shouldn't be enough to let someone into your account
[20:55:17] <rpav> right, but at the same time, stealing 2 passwords only differs by a constant factor ;)
[20:55:18] <technomancy> the point isn't that there should be exactly two factors. multi-factor auth is a better word for it.
[20:55:47] <technomancy> the backup codes are single-use so it doesn't work the same
[20:55:54] <rpav> but e.g. i use bitwarden for passwords, but using it also for totp (at least most of the time) would definitely defeat the point 
[20:56:00] <technomancy> like, a key logger stealing a backup code is useless
[20:56:08] <rpav> probably using a separate totp app would at least require 2 breaches
[20:56:24] <rpav> stealing backup codes is definitely not useless
[20:56:40] <rpav> you only need 1 or 2 to reset an account's 2fa generally
[20:56:52] <technomancy> stealing backup codes *using a key logger* is useless
[20:57:00] <technomancy> because by the time you've got them they're already expired
[20:57:15] <rpav> oh, i was assuming the key logger was running when they got saved, too ;)

[20:58:39] <rpav> it's funny how much we use the clipboard to transfer secure data, yet keylogging is a lot harder than clipboard logging
[20:58:48] <TRS-80> and a proper implementation takes care of that, too (or the keyboard on Android, which is I guess how that works, because there is a separate KeePass keyboard to enter your secrets)

[22:08:34] <bremner> technomancy: I'm not sure I agree. I mean, existing surface syntaxes (json, ini, yaml, sexp) are all pretty user hostile (or just dumb in the case of ini). And I'm not convinced having a turing complete config language is a win

[23:01:55] <akk> Hey, I'm getting "package cl is deprecated" when I start emacs, which is apparently coming from the frame-cmds.el and frame-fns.el I downloaded several years ago.
[23:02:09] <TRS-80> I remember it being connected to a monitor
[23:02:17] <akk> Is there a better way to get those two files that might keep them up to date?
[23:02:38] <TRS-80> akk: I think they were renamed to something else, that package probably needs updating maybe?
[23:03:03] <akk> I don't think it's part of any updatable package, it's just a couple files I downloaded to my .emacs.d/lisp.
[23:03:21] <TRS-80> hopefully they are not like, in emacs orphanage or something...  If so, you want to become maintainer?  lol
[23:03:29] <akk> nooooooo! :)
[23:03:40] <TRS-80> then it will be up to you to simply search/replace probebly
[23:03:54] <TRS-80> Up to you if you decide to share this patch with broader community.
[23:04:03] <akk> Is there a way to see if there are updatable packages that might provide these files?
[23:04:20] <TRS-80> yes, checking the usual places I guess?
[23:04:56] <akk> Maybe I should clarify: I don't know what "the usual places" are, most emacs stuff I get either via debian packages or finding snippets via web searches.
[23:05:01] <thblt> akk:  you can just replace (require 'cl) with (require 'cl-lib) and see if things work.  Or the compile time cl-macs (IIRC) 
[23:05:48] <thblt> Those seem to be from Drew Adams https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/frame-cmds.el 
[23:05:56] <acdw> akk: there's also this library which I used one time, it didn't kill anything: https://github.com/purcell/cl-libify
[23:06:01] <acdw> might help with the conversion
[23:06:03] <TRS-80> akk: OK so those would be ELPA, MELPA, there are some others as well; and some other ways to  ...  OK hold the phone
[23:06:29] <TRS-80> above is for most things, but Drew famously only releases his stuff on EmacsWiki... so just check there for updated version

[23:24:30] <TRS-80> I could also be totally wrong about that

[23:47:55] <artefact> mine is just [H][s][M][C/space][M][s][H], but i haven't bound anything to H- yet (too far away)
[23:48:11] <ldlework> the only time you need modifiers on both sides are for the ones too far to push with your thumbs
[23:48:18] <ldlework> like natural-ctrl
[23:48:21] <ldlework> or shift
[23:48:23] <ldlework> etc
[23:48:26] <artefact> also i hate the huge amount of programming symbols behind iso level3 shift :(

[23:49:56] <artefact> \{} (very painful for tex), _<> (painful for most other languages), that's on the bépo layout (french dvorak)
[23:50:05] <ldlework> the secret of central modifiers is your hands remain in typing position. so press the modifier, then type the second part of the binding as "normal" (usually)
[23:50:16] <thblt> artefact: if you use auctex you rarely need to actually type \ or {}
[23:50:18] <ldlework> no need for each modifier on each side

[23:50:37] <artefact> for central keys sure
[23:50:44] <ldlework> now you can double the central modifiers available to you
[23:51:06] <Bayes> ldlework: how do you double the central mods?
[23:51:08] <ldlework> hyper, ctrl, meta, super

[23:51:24] <artefact> i am actually waiting for a keyboard with split spacebar, so you have [space][shift][ctrl][space]
[23:51:26] <ldlework> i can only reach 2-deep on each side of the spacebar with my thumbs
[23:51:30] <ldlework> so that's 4 keys
[23:51:34] <ldlework> if I needed each modifier on both  sides
[23:51:37] <ldlework> that'd be only 2 modifiers 
[23:51:41] <ldlework> if we abandon that notion
[23:51:43] <ldlework> we can have 4

[23:53:04] <TRS-80> OK, so I guess M-TAB is completion-at-point?  Like for variables, etc.?  So what is thing called like in emacs-lisp mode where the function args are shown in message area?

[23:57:52] <thblt> Not that I know of. Shell isn't self-documenting.
[23:58:23] <thblt> But there's a LSP server for shell scripts I think.

[23:59:48] <TRS-80> No, but I already wrote a function to collect all the function names in not only the buffer, but also recursively goes to sourced files and gets those, too.  So now all I should need to do (if I am understanding correctly) is present them to some sort of help function and do some sort of thing-at-point recognition of members of the list, and then...  Well, not sure exactly.  :)  Trying to figure
[23:59:51] <TRS-80> that out...
