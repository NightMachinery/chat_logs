[09:17:42] <stencl> Hi, I would like to ask if there is someone who would be willing to help me with a problem?
[09:17:42] <stencl> I have a video streaming project (HLS) and my video and audio are not synchronised (audio is ahead). I have read the documentation and tried a lot but still can't solve it. I can provide more info (ffmpeg command, environment, etc).
[09:17:43] <stencl> I would appreciate any help, thank you.
[09:18:30] <hyrcanus> what's HLS
[09:20:06] <stencl> apple http live streaming protocol https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-all.html#toc-hls-2
[09:20:28] *** Quits: yeirr (~yeirr@user/yeirr) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[09:21:38] <stencl> I think it is not a problem with HLS directly but with decoding/encoding on GPU... not sure though
[09:21:48] <furq> i doubt it has anything to do with hls
[09:22:54] <stencl> If anyone would be interested what command I run ->

[10:10:36] <dv_> I am puzzled why some hardware en/decoders have support for both jpeg and mjpeg

[10:43:12] <aphysically> hmmm, well I already have code to properly crop if the video is being reencoded, so I could code to only add it if the user asked to explicitly copy the video *and* chose the crop option
[10:43:30] <aphysically> it still might be better to include it even if it's only partly supported as long as nothing drops it I guess
[10:43:48] <aphysically> nothing messes up the video entirely I mean
[10:44:09] <furq> it won't actually break it but it won't work in enough places that i would at least put a big warning on there
[10:44:17] <furq> won't work as in it won't be cropped as requested
[10:44:56] <aphysically> yeah it'll be interesting to see if it's fine in web browser software decoders
[10:45:02] <furq> in my experience yes
[10:45:19] <furq> but most browsers do hwdec now
[10:45:19] <aphysically> well in that case it would work globally on linux (hah...)
[10:45:21] <furq> lol
[10:46:20] <furq> but what if i have this specific combination of display server and compositor and graphics card and drivers...
[10:46:50] <aphysically> yeah I mean right now if user selects crop + copy video it's just error: ur being a dum dum, but I can replace this with WARNING: attempting bitstream filter but probably won't work
[10:46:58] <furq> yeah that works
[10:47:13] <furq> idk if it's also broken on nvidia or mobile etc i only tried with amd and intel
[10:47:29] <furq> that was a deeply annoying few hours
[10:48:50] <aphysically> yeah I'll play with bitstream filters tomorrow I think, for now sleep

[13:10:31] <janluu__> hey, i am currently taking a look on encoding a live hls audio-only stream with ffmpeg. correct me if i am wrong, but to my understanding hls allows segment-specific metadata. is there anyway to include that in the encoding process for example from a result of a shell script or should i look into a post-process solution that does not include ffmpeg?
[13:11:33] <janluu__> "post-process solution" meaning that i should have a script that injects the metadata to a segment before it's served a listener
[13:11:44] <janluu__> *served to a listener

[21:12:40] <aphysically> DeHackEd: calculating the bitstream filter needed with cropdetect
[21:13:16] <aphysically> if the video is being re-encoded I just do a normal crop filter, and if the user selects to copy the video (w/o reencoding) + crop it I show an error
[21:13:30] <aphysically> but instead of throwing an error I can attempt to crop with bitstream filter and just show a warning that it may not work everywhere
[21:13:37] <furq> they're both after
[21:14:26] <aphysically> ah, so I need some way to find if there's already a bitstream filter with ffprobe. Let's find or make a sample and inspect it :)
[21:14:50] <aphysically> (unless you can stack bitstream crop filtersin which case it doesn't matter)
[21:18:02] <furq>  These values will replace the current ones if the stream is already cropped.
[21:18:14] <furq> i thought it was coded_width/coded_height in ffprobe but apparently not
[21:18:19] <furq> i'm sure there was some way to see it
[21:19:30] <aphysically> yeah I need to get the width/height before/after the bitstream filters to be able to use the cropdetect output to set a new one correct in the completely general case
[21:19:37] <furq> right
[21:20:01] <furq> i guess if all else fails you can just set them all to 0 and then run ffprobe again
[21:20:04] <furq> that kind of sucks though
[21:20:34] <aphysically> yeah that's not great, especially just to deal with an edge case
[21:20:52] <furq> well it's fairly usual for there to be bottom and right cropping
[21:21:09] <furq> h264 is always internally mod16 so e.g. all 1080p streams are bitstream cropped
[21:21:36] <furq> which is why hwdec honours bottom and right but then doesn't bother with top and left
[21:21:37] <aphysically> ah, I knew that about h264 but I didn't know it used bitstream filters to do it
[21:22:04] <furq> yeah the filter sets the same fields
[21:24:33] <aphysically> what makes you say it's not coded_width/coded_height
[21:26:13] <furq> i tried it and it didn't work
[21:26:19] <furq> google seems to think it does and i'm sure i remember it being that
[21:28:03] <aphysically> is there a regression?
[21:28:21] <aphysically> I thought I remembered coded_height being 1088 before
[21:28:27] <aphysically> but I'm only seeing 1080
[21:28:47] <furq> maybe
[21:29:33] <aphysically> if there's a regression it's before 4.4 release it seems
[21:29:40] <aphysically> I don't have anything older around to test
[21:29:53] <aphysically> for now at least
[21:30:33] <furq> tried with 3.4 and it still says 1080
[21:32:14] <aphysically> ?? am I crazy to remember it being 1088
[21:32:48] <furq> if you are then we're in it together
[21:35:43] <aphysically> is there some dynamically linked library involved in the coded_height that could have changed?

[21:38:11] <aphysically> is coded_height/width always the same for you? I'm trying to find any sample where it's different right now
[21:39:53] <furq> from the three h264 samples i looked at yes
[21:40:17] <furq> mediainfo does show the original dimensions but the labels are backwards for some reason and also not for 1080p
[21:40:26] <furq> so that's useless
[21:42:32] <aphysically> I get Stored_Height                            : 1088 in mediainfo at least
[21:42:40] <aphysically> with -f option for "full" I guess
[21:44:44] <aphysically> maybe someone can chime in and tell us what coded_height/width really is (and maybe how to get the pre-bsf width/height)
[21:46:41] <aphysically> since right now it seems broken :P
[21:46:48] <BtbN> It's the actual size of the buffer
[21:47:17] <BtbN> like, a lot of codecs can only encode blocks of 16x16, so for example can't encode 1920x1080, which ends up with a coded_height of 1088
[21:47:31] <aphysically> right, but we're getting coded_height of 1080
[21:47:50] <aphysically> we thought maybe it was a regression, but I checked 4.4 and furq says they checked 3.4
[21:48:05] <BtbN> The codec was able to represent it then, or the decoder already took care of discarding the extra data
[21:48:17] <furq> this is for h264
[21:48:40] <furq> also it shows the same values for both after -bsf:v h264_metadata=crop_right=64:crop_bottom=64 -c copy
[21:49:17] <BtbN> nah, the crop metadata is unrelated to that
[21:52:38] <aphysically> Ah, well if the width/height shown by ffprobe is always before bsf filters I'll need some other way to get the post-bsf width/height
[21:54:51] <aphysically> furq: it looks like this is a bug on old versions of ffmpeg https://trac.ffmpeg.org/ticket/6958?cversion=0&cnum_hist=1
[21:54:59] <aphysically> so it could still be a regression (i.e. it got fixed then regressed again)
[21:55:11] <aphysically> so we may not be crazy after all
[22:03:00] <aphysically> yes it's a regression I found it furq
[22:03:01] <aphysically> https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg/commit/04f49645a519233f3638104e0df5215758652fcb#diff-c43da4436863343bc4eef4639fc30a791f280d63e0f0a8d4f65bf5301fd91349
[22:05:11] <furq> 19:19:17 ( BtbN) nah, the crop metadata is unrelated to that
[22:05:18] <furq> so apparently this both is and isn't true which is very cool very normal
[22:05:35] <furq> if i encode a 1080p file it has the bottom crop set to 8 but then if i unset it everything reports it still being 1080 tall
[22:06:20] <BtbN> it depends on how deep down the rabbit hole you go
[22:06:26] <furq> aphysically: maybe the right answer is to just not let people do this because it seems like a mess
[22:06:35] <BtbN> at the raw bitstream level, it's 1088 with crop_bottom=8
[22:06:45] <BtbN> but once it comes out of the decoder it's just 1080 with a coded_height of 1088
[22:06:54] <BtbN> and no crop_bottom anymore
[22:07:13] <aphysically> okay so two things then 1) I need to open a trac bug reporting the regression 2) the width/height isn't related to the bsf filters so I have to come up with a different way to get actual post-bsf width/height that's not ffprobe
[22:07:26] <aphysically> or 3) don't let users do this it seems like a mess
[22:08:03] <furq> they are related you can check with h264_analyze
[22:08:14] <aphysically> cause you said the bsf weren't changing the (non-coded) width/height reported too
[22:08:16] <furq> also i think maybe muxing it is causing some confusion here
[22:08:55] <aphysically> furq: no i mean, the "width" and "height" fields of ffprobe, not the width and height in general
[22:09:01] <furq> in mkv ffprobe/mpv show no bottom crop as 1080 but raw h264 as 1088
[22:09:03] <aphysically> sorry confusing wording

[22:09:57] <aphysically> those fields would have to be changed by bsf filters for me to rely on them in general, or rather, I need them to correspond to the width and height getting fed into cropdetect
[22:10:47] <aphysically> but anyway the coded_height/coded_width regression being in the wild for a lot of releases means I probably can't rely on that in general anyway
[22:11:07] <furq> if nothing else it is weird that ffprobe doesn't show the internal values anywhere
[22:11:16] <furq> i guess if it's getting the values out of the decoder then that would explain it but it's still annoying
[22:12:17] <furq> but yeah top/left cropping has big caveats anyway so i would probably just not let people do this in the first place
[22:12:24] <furq> hardly anyone knows you can even do it at all

[23:13:13] <Nick_d0gb0y> Hi folks, I was wondering if it was possible to request encoding to a codec that ffmpeg currently decodes (but doesn’t encode)
[23:14:15] <JEEB> why not? first thing to check is whether someone is up to code an encoder, or if there is a library available doing that
[23:14:34] <another|> Nick_d0gb0y: Request in what form? Do you want ffmpeg to give you the raw data to ingest into a encoder?
[23:16:47] *** Joins: SimAV (~SimAV@d221-239.dialin.ggew-net.de)
[23:19:54] <Nick_d0gb0y> Thanks for the responses, I figured it required some coding, I just wondered if there was an official mechanism for requesting (I’d love to be capable of doing it myself, but my coding skills are slim)
[23:20:30] <Nick_d0gb0y> I’d like to be able to use ffmpeg or an encoder GUI to transcode files to notchLC (nclc)
[23:21:33] <durandal_1707> notchLC is GPU codec
[23:22:06] *** Joins: arcatech (~arcatech@user/arcatech)
[23:22:39] <Nick_d0gb0y> Yes it is, is that a limiting factor?
[23:23:06] <JEEB> the GPU thing wasn't open source
[23:23:07] <JEEB> IIRC
[23:23:18] <JEEB> there was an open source (?) CPU implementation, but that generally isn't what you want?
[23:24:52] <Nick_d0gb0y> I can check with the notchLC developers, they have an SDK, encode has been implemented in some other tools (touchdesigner, media encoder, QuickTime) so I’d guess it’s available. But perhaps the licensing model isn’t compatible with ffmpeg.
[23:24:55] <durandal_1707> Nick_d0gb0y: it is if you want to write GPU encoder in FFmpeg
[23:25:27] <JEEB> Nick_d0gb0y: well they sell the GPU stuff, and thus it cannot be open source. for integration with FFmpeg it has to be open source.
[23:25:42] *** Quits: intrac (~intracube@user/intracube) (Quit: Konversation terminated!)
[23:25:44] <JEEB> of course if you just need CPU encoding
[23:25:57] <JEEB>  then one could implement that, sure
[23:25:59] *** Joins: intrac (~intracube@user/intracube)
[23:26:22] <durandal_1707> ffmpeg have not framework for GPU encoding IIRC
[23:26:53] <Nick_d0gb0y> CPU encoding would be a start… does the GPU side of things reside with the notchLC devs or with nvidia/AMD?
[23:26:55] <JEEB> well you can push hw AVFrames just fine to an encoder, so technically if an encoder can receive those
[23:27:12] <JEEB> Nick_d0gb0y: it's proprietary GPU shader or whatever code, it's what they get their $$$ off of
[23:27:24] <JEEB> which is fair, but not really compatible with FFmpeg
[23:27:52] <durandal_1707> coding encoder for free -- out of questions
[23:27:53] <Nick_d0gb0y> The devs get their money from their tool (“notch”) I believe they wanted notchLC to be freely available.
[23:28:56] <JEEB> they want tools to be able to implement it in some capacity, so that their format gets utilized. that's why there's basic CPU code available (I think?)
[23:29:04] <JEEB> but then the fast GPU stuff behind locks
[23:29:06] <JEEB> unsurprisingly
[23:29:19] <durandal_1707> JEEB: wtf, you talk about
[23:29:26] <durandal_1707> i wrote decoder in ffmpeg
[23:29:33] <JEEB> I was not talking about the FFmpeg decoder
[23:29:46] <JEEB> I just recall quickly checking at some point that they did have some reference OSS code, but only CPU
[23:29:49] <JEEB> not GPU
[23:30:03] <durandal_1707> yea, even vfw encoder
[23:30:14] <durandal_1707> its not available any more?
[23:30:34] <JEEB> no, I was just noting that if I was mistaken, it might just be because time has passed and I misremember
[23:30:41] <Nick_d0gb0y> Ok, it sounds like they may have made it harder than I expected. I can check with them though.
[23:31:12] <JEEB> sure. I just think their business bases on their GPU stuff being something not in the open :)
[23:31:14] <durandal_1707> if you on windows you can encode fine, (dunno if its demo/trial or what not)
[23:31:33] <durandal_1707> and code is basic crap
[23:31:38] <durandal_1707> as any GPU codec

[23:35:44] <durandal_1707> Nick_d0gb0y: why not use other GPU special codecs?
[23:37:58] <Nick_d0gb0y> Ah notchLC is the favourite for real-time/media server playback. We used to use HAP, but notchLC addresses some banding issues and supports 10-bit colour. So it’s preferable over HAP.
[23:40:38] <durandal_1707> iirc there are other codecs, not just hap

[23:44:21] <Nick_d0gb0y> Sadly on the servers/software we use tend to support only a few codecs for reliable playback. Quite often they’re high res/high bitrate files that need to play in sync across multiple servers with frame accuracy.
[23:44:46] <Nick_d0gb0y> So not all codecs are supported. And those that are tend to exhibit banding artefacts on LED screens.

[23:47:49] <durandal_1707> Nick_d0gb0y: if you want to make GPU encoder, i have extracted .hsls and converted to .glsl
[23:49:02] <durandal_1707> but you could write one from loooking at CPU decoder code...
[23:55:12] <Nick_d0gb0y> I’ll definitely take a look. Not to sound like a complete n00b but could you point me in the direction of an example? I might be able to copy/pasta something. I’ve had limited success in the past. But I understand a little GLSL.
[23:56:00] <Nick_d0gb0y> I appreciate your advice folks, I know it’s not ideal someone rolling up and asking arbitrarily about an encoder. Thanks for listening.
[23:57:50] <durandal_1707> Nick_d0gb0y: i just extracted stuff from binary, and used other wip trascriber to translate to .glsl shader
