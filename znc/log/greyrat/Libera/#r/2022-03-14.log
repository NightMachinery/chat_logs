[20:09:03] <Bayes> hm so colnames and rownames are cast as characters?
[20:10:01] <fendur> yes. i think that's important to distinguish when you want indices versus names
[20:10:01] <Bayes> str(rownames(`row.names<-`(mtcars, seq(nrow(mtcars))))) :(
[20:16:39] <Bayes> fendur agh, I was hoping to use dimnames to index my data
[20:16:59] <fendur> i don't follow.
[20:18:57] <Bayes> yeah maybe doesn't make much sense
[20:19:19] <Bayes> I just wanted not to rely on the fact that the matrix I'm subsetting will be "well ordered"
[20:19:46] <fendur> i don't see why you couldn't do what you want
[20:19:52] <Bayes> as in inds <- 1:100, myMatrix[inds, ]
[20:19:55] <fendur> i think that's a valid concern
[20:20:28] <Bayes> myMatrix[rownames(myMatrix) %in% inds, ] is what I was going for
[20:20:36] <fendur> i feel like that could go wrong
[20:20:44] <fendur> not sure though. why not just name them with strings?
[20:20:49] <fendur> that's more explicit
[20:20:54] <Bayes> tho now inds, which is numeric in nature, and rownames have been cast as strings :/
[20:21:16] <Bayes> oh that's just my kink, I like to keep ids numerics
[20:21:47] <Bayes> cause those ids are also part of other data frames typically as a (numeric) column
[20:22:18] <fendur> maybe get over your kink :)
[20:22:47] <Bayes> in any case... I've been given a data set that has made me notice a few things that typically go implicit
[20:22:52] <Bayes> but this dataset may very well evident
[20:22:58] <Bayes> made*
[20:22:58] <fendur> if they get shuffled for some reason (not exactly sure why, but i think you're right to be concerned) then that will be the fix.
[20:23:33] <Bayes> brain is all foggy today sorry for the typos/nonsense xD
[20:23:46] <fendur> that's my life
[20:23:58] <Bayes> so you'd still have a data frame with numeric ids as characters?
[20:24:14] <fendur> if i was relying on a specific ordering? yes
[20:24:20] <Bayes> so what I was thinking is...
[20:24:24] <Bayes> I think what I want to do is...
[20:24:35] <Bayes> something I've been considering for quite a while is...
[20:24:48] <Bayes> using attributes
[20:25:00] <fendur> that's what names are
[20:25:16] <Bayes> yes, except names are forcefully characters
[20:25:37] <Bayes> and you get fancy subsetting with the [ ]
[20:25:50] <fendur> oh so making alternative index attribute?
[20:26:19] <Bayes> in this case I'm thinking attr(X, "varId") <- varId1, attr(X, "obsId") <- obsId, etc
[20:26:21] <Bayes> yep
[20:26:34] <Bayes> which will make subsetting ugly as shit
[20:26:50] <fendur> yeah get over your kink :P
[20:26:51] <Bayes> BUT I typically wrap all data handling in a function
[20:27:34] <fendur> are the attributes row specific such that they will be reordered if the object is reordered?
[20:27:35] <confuzeus> why depend on an ordering? is that time series? how about row()?
[20:27:47] <Bayes> get_dataname(varId = NULL, obsId = NULL, foldId = NULL) etc, if you give non null it will subset it for you
[20:28:14] <Bayes> I don't plan on reordering my data structure really, only doing (random) subsets
[20:28:22] <Bayes> it just feels a bit... fragile if it depends on the order
[20:28:45] <Bayes> that's why I like to have an explicit ID that I can use to trace things thru all the munging in case I need to
[20:29:14] <Bayes> and I can be sure that, at the very end, I'm working with obsId 40689 as indexed in the raw data set
[20:29:39] <Bayes> also, another limitation of using dimnames as indices is that...
[20:29:44] <Bayes> you can only have one index per dimension
[20:29:47] <fendur> confuzeus: i believe it's because they will be using otherwise disconnected data sets
[20:30:10] <Bayes> that, and also I want to have explicit links I can trace back if needed
[20:30:49] <Bayes> so by the end when I produce a figure using a sub sample, that sub sample has an explicit ID for each observation that links to the full data set and such
[20:31:31] <Bayes> I was saying dimnames allow for one index per dimension unless you start adding - . , by hand which beats the point
[20:32:10] <Bayes> in some cases I have multiple indices, e.g., row 10 is for "observationId 5, measurementId 3"
[20:33:06] <Bayes> I'm flattening a very irregular data set, just in case confuzeus will accuse me of kinking on complexity :P
[20:34:17] <confuzeus> hahaha. but i think adding id variables into the individual datasets is the way to go rather than resort to attributes?
[20:34:47] <fendur> confuzeus: that's problematic if one of the data sets is a numeric matrix
[20:35:03] <fendur> so names make lots of sense. Bayes just doesn't like character names.
[20:35:23] <Bayes> agreed, unfortunately in some cases the "right" representation of a data is actually a matrix of an array
[20:36:09] <confuzeus> then numeric ids will work across matrices and dataframes?
[20:36:13] <Bayes> idk having numbers as character indices feels a bit weird but I'll give it another thought
[20:37:16] <Bayes> anyway
[20:37:22] <fendur> confuzeus: Bayes: if you need to use that matrix in some matrix operations, it's also a little obfuscated to always have to do M[,-1]
[20:37:40] <Bayes> no, for sure
[20:37:49] <Bayes> the matrix content is the data itself and nothing else
[20:38:08] <fendur> obfuscated is probably not the right word
[20:38:18] <Bayes> anyway I think string ids could be fine
[20:38:28] <Bayes> in some cases they're strings already
[20:38:54] <Bayes> things as "BrO" that would be too arbitrary to store as numbers
[20:41:08] <confuzeus> could this hack work along your original thoughts : myMatrix[row(myMatrix[1]) %in% inds, ] 
[20:51:29] <confuzeus> luckily for flattening datasets, it should not matter which type of id variable you use. so no need for complexity
[20:57:39] <Bayes> yeah idk, I'm gonna sleep on it

[22:33:24] <shrysr> i use a combination of dbplyr and dbGetQuery(). For db connections - I just setup all db connections in a db.conf file referenced via the pool package or dbConnect(). For long running queries, I think pool is a good option. RSQLite appears to be correct.package  
[22:35:43] <Bayes> oh okay we have another dbplyrist
[22:36:29] <Bayes> since for my use case all the db thing I'll be doing is basically reading the table one, I think I'll stick to RSQLite via DBI for now, and use data.table for data munging as usual
[22:38:35] <shrysr> yea with dbplyr you can easily pipe a table from a db into.. anything and add a collect() in the end to pull in the data. As simple as tbl(conn, my_silly_table) %>% group_by(lol, cat) .... conn is your dbconnection object. idk the data.table equivalent
[22:39:15] <shrysr> hmm https://atrebas.github.io/post/2019-03-03-datatable-dplyr/   
[22:40:43] <shrysr> afaik ^ dbplyr arrangement of directly referencing tables is.. easier than the limited exposure I've had of pythons sqlalchemy where iirc a class/object has to be created to map the tables.
