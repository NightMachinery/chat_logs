[01:03:13] <mixfix41> you may be able to toggle it
[01:03:36] <mixfix41> while its happening but i forget how verbose fedora is
[01:05:07] <Bco1981> you could just, read the logs.
[01:06:13] <mixfix41> yeah i guess my install has been rock solid everything that should work does work including security features
[01:07:05] <HeTo> if something is broken you can just disable quiet and boot it that way
[01:07:39] <HeTo> I rather like the Solaris 10 (and probably later) boot screen. just a few lines telling you what it is
[01:08:44] <HeTo> but I guess you can get a more verbose boot with boot -v or something if you need it
[01:10:07] <DaPinkOne> Aurora_v_kosmose, I prefer to disable all the neat graphics during boot so I can see the incomprehensible driverloading garbage scroll past

[01:10:42] <DaPinkOne> if it fails to make it in, i'm fucked 80% of the time anyway
[01:16:57] <Aurora_v_kosmose> mixfix41: Oh it's easy to toggle, you just remove "quiet" from your grub line, but it's annoying it's a default.
[01:17:19] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Bco1981: Ain't no log if it refuses to boot because something went wrong with a filesystem
[01:17:39] <Bco1981> you probably need a new drive then
[01:17:49] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Bco1981: That's not the point.
[01:18:02] <Aurora_v_kosmose> The point is ease of diagnostics should be prioritized over useless graphics.
[01:18:02] <mixfix41> if its not broken it could be an underlying security feature
[01:18:04] <ButterNoodle> gotta see dem drdy errors
[01:18:55] <Aurora_v_kosmose> And I'm just complaining about a default I have to change on every machine I setup that shouldn't be a default.

[01:20:03] <mixfix41> its actually pretty nifty you could try it yourself install fedora , install redhat on another drive, then mount the fedora drive with a sata to usb cord a few times until it triggers it, and you will have to repair it with the redhat install iirc
[01:20:44] <mixfix41> theres more to it because i was pretty frustrate with the whole thing but theres a few commands that will 'revive' fedora i dont know it off the top of my head tho

[01:29:52] <Aurora_v_kosmose> s/used/use/
[01:30:08] <Bco1981> an old core2 duo/quad would benefit alot from a light weight OS like raspbian
[01:30:14] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Debian is probably the Linux distro with the most supported architectures.
[01:30:23] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Bco1981: You realize that Debian is one of the lightest distros around?
[01:30:37] <mixfix41> for me i use it for a stepping stone to learn debian i agree tho i would use debian if i learn enough of raspbian later
[01:31:07] <Bco1981> yeah, but it dos not have the same UI available, and no LXDE is not the same
[01:31:15] <Bco1981> does*
[01:31:38] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Bco1981: There absolutely is.
[01:32:07] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Bco1981: There's no pre-installed LXDE version, but you can perfectly well bootstrap from Debian Standard (CLI-only) to LXDE.
[01:32:27] <Bco1981> the raspiban ui is based off of LXDE. but you won't get the same snappy light weight feel
[01:32:30] <Bco1981> i tried it
[01:32:41] <Bco1981> raspbian*
[01:32:46] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Then you obviously fucked up in some way. It's the same package.
[01:33:17] <Bco1981> yes i fucked up "apt-get install lxde"
[01:33:37] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Bco1981: It might well have installed unnecessary recommends, yes.
[01:33:54] <Aurora_v_kosmose> apt install --no-install-recommends lxde # then you read what it recommends and wants, and pick what you need
[01:34:11] <mixfix41> raspbian is good too they even take critical network packages out that you are able to compile back in to learn the compile from source process
[01:34:19] <mixfix41> raspbian is a good distro in that right
[01:34:48] <Aurora_v_kosmose> That's not really hard to learn.
[01:34:55] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Debian also supports building packages from source
[01:35:19] <mixfix41> it is debian i use the debian pages to do it all with
[01:35:34] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Yup.
[01:35:42] <mixfix41> theres that void that raspbian either knew people were going to want to use esp a rpi
[01:35:49] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Packaging for Debian sucks though.
[01:35:55] <Guest54> apt?
[01:36:15] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Guest54: The package manager for debian. apt-get is technically internal utils now.
[01:36:42] <Aurora_v_kosmose> But since Debian now includes Guix in its package repositories since Debian 11 (Bullseye)... you can just package for Guix and use it alongside apt on Debian.
[01:37:01] <Aurora_v_kosmose> And given Guix uses its own file hierarchy, there's no conflicting problems like there'd be if you tried to use dnf on Debian.

[01:39:13] <Guest54> ParrotOS was created by a high schooler. I don't trust it
[01:39:19] <mixfix41> i show some effort learning and i get my answer to my question too
[01:42:44] <mixfix41> also im just too lazy to upgrade my raspbian jessie at this moment
[01:42:53] <mixfix41> maybe later but compiling from source is soooooooo much easier
[01:43:36] <mixfix41> or if i did have more important tasks for my pi but its all hobby stuff for now
[01:44:16] <mixfix41> i really like raspbian
[01:44:25] <mixfix41> on the pi1 you can launch vlc and songs no probs
[01:44:44] <mixfix41> the music video will be jerky or stalls but the sound is impeccable
[01:44:48] <Bco1981> vlc feels heavy, mpv
[01:45:00] <mixfix41> i could try mpv but vlc has won me over
[01:45:21] <mixfix41> i use to use mpv for a little while but i like mplayer/mplayer2 vlc THEN mpv
[01:45:44] <mixfix41> its the same thing but its maintain a lot better
[01:46:09] <mixfix41> vlc youtube-dl hook is not good either but you can always pipe youtube-dl to vlc
[01:46:18] <mixfix41> and that always prevents me to use mpv anyway
[01:47:13] <mixfix41> im not even a heavy vlc user as i should be cause i remember doing that syncplay when we were over at freenode and playing with the visual settings
[01:47:33] <mixfix41> it was nice i wasnt watching the movie at that point
[01:48:13] <Aurora_v_kosmose> /mplayer2?/ is not really maintained anymore
[01:48:37] <Aurora_v_kosmose> mpv was forked off for that reason.
[01:48:42] <mixfix41> yea raspbian jessie has it in its repo its ok i g dont use it i just run vlc
[01:48:53] <mixfix41> slackware still has mplayer
[01:48:54] <mixfix41> i love mplayer
[01:49:02] <mixfix41> i can play a whole directory album with mplayer
[01:49:16] <Aurora_v_kosmose> So can mpv. It's the same base program, with patches for newer stuff.
[01:49:31] <mixfix41> yup but mplayer is include already in slackware
[01:49:43] <mixfix41> so you dont have to have mpv unless you use it for something ese
[01:49:52] <Aurora_v_kosmose> I think that's more an argument against slackware due to outdated repositories... 
[01:50:10] <mixfix41> well its the philosophy ofc
[01:50:36] <Aurora_v_kosmose> "Keep outdated. Ignore decoder security fixes. YOLO" ?
[01:50:59] <mixfix41> yes if you know about vanilla packages and know not to destory your package warehouse then binary package is where its at
[01:51:10] *** Quits: saganman (uid349353@user/saganman) (Quit: Connection closed for inactivity)
[01:51:19] <mixfix41> but even then slackware you can bang up your warehouse and see how it runs internally
[01:51:32] <Aurora_v_kosmose> The overwhelming majority of distros use binary packages.
[01:51:40] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Source-based is the rare case.
[01:51:59] <mixfix41> yes but the slackware philosphy is close to that of freebsd and unix 
[01:52:16] <Aurora_v_kosmose> I'm not sure I'd consider that a good thing, considering the inherent architectural issues in UNIX model...
[01:52:47] <mixfix41> true but if you know the core values then yes you want your packages maintain in some sort of way (or even your own custom way)
[01:53:12] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Slackware is (in)famous for simply ignoring dependency resolution and saying "lol figure it out".
[01:53:26] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Which other than wasting your time having to go lookup your program's documentation, doesn't really teach you anything.

[01:54:16] <Aurora_v_kosmose> mixfix41: And the dependency hell issue has been fixed by the latest generation of package managers. Guix/Nix don't have the issue anymore.
[01:54:40] <mixfix41> true but i wouldnt go saying slackware is lacking where as theres a wealth of information to study
[01:54:54] <Aurora_v_kosmose> All they had to do was admit the HFS isn't sacred and if it gets in the way of better designs, then it can be disregarded.
[01:55:15] <mixfix41> but i dont see the issue as is you can do whatever you want after the fact
[01:55:24] <Aurora_v_kosmose> s/HFS/FHS/
[01:55:25] <mixfix41> why does it have to effect slackwares main tree
[01:56:00] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Ignoring the problem doesn't solve it is my point.
[01:56:20] <Aurora_v_kosmose> So claiming "we don't have dependency hell" because you fail to address it entirely isn't solving the problem.
[01:56:28] <mixfix41> no but maybe your problems are too techical i dont know what you are actually saying since it doesnt involve me whoever conversation we may be actually saying to each toher
[01:56:55] <mixfix41> if you study slackware you are bound to bump into guix

[01:57:51] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Basically I started with saying that slackware still using mplayer (unmaintained) instead of mpv suggests it probably also has older versions of ffmpeg which have had code-execution vulnerabilities over the years.
[01:58:10] <mixfix41> yes but dont overlook you can customize your system
[01:58:43] <Aurora_v_kosmose> And then we drifted to their approach to package management (or near lackthereof)

[01:59:14] <mixfix41> but its just that unstable. its good for gaming. and also good for learning how to handle linux but things do break as you are updating packages
[01:59:28] <mixfix41> same with package managers too but you give alll your control to the package managers too
[01:59:53] <mixfix41> and it never upgrades your kernel too so you do it seperately which makes the upgrading better
[02:00:07] <mixfix41> in a way
[02:00:12] <mixfix41> if you know how to do it quickly and know what to do
[02:00:18] <mixfix41> otherwise yea it takes a bit
[02:00:59] <mixfix41> theres pitfalls but mplayer in their build farm runs very well
[02:01:09] <mixfix41> its almost if you try to compile it from source it will suck
[02:01:16] <mixfix41> so you want it the slackware stock
[02:01:24] <mixfix41> cause they have it in the farm which goes over it
[02:01:55] <mixfix41> more obviously in slackware arm too
[02:02:06] <mixfix41> cause it just breaks realy bad too
[02:02:11] <mixfix41> if you compile it yourself
[02:02:19] <mixfix41> so yea theres pitfalls like that
[02:02:55] <mixfix41> slackware runs very well broken too
[02:03:04] <mixfix41> if you gut it and its going it just keeps going
[02:03:53] <mixfix41> well better get to working on some utility tables need some more tables so i can do various things on tty guys later..
[02:04:37] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Part of my issues with the UNIX model go as deep as the choice of allowing direct memory referencing instead of using capabilities.

[12:40:59] <ewong> drug dealer simulator??  Really?  
[12:41:25] <ewong> next thing you know.. there's going to be a fart simulator.
[12:42:36] <Cryowolf> there might be one in the works, who knows
[12:45:50] <Cryowolf> There's a PC building simulator. If that actually has real world physics in it with airflow and how it interacts with fans and components, it could be a useful tool when building your own chassi, or choosing which to buy and how to place fans
[12:46:25] <ewong> well.. ya gotta give credit for originality...
[12:47:22] <Cryowolf> yeh, there's farming, there's trucks, there's car mechanic, there's ranchers, there's bus driver simulator
[12:47:31] <Cryowolf> there's goat simulator (that ones famous though)

[13:20:28] <amigojapan> I am ok with masks

[14:15:40] <ImoutoBot> PancakeMatsuri: I don't know.
[14:16:33] <Cryowolf> I wish I knew an easy way to anonymously buy bitcoin (no locals are really selling it for the low amount I want it for, 100-200 euro)
[14:18:10] <theholyduck> i mean the whole point of bitcoin is that its not very private i ts how they keep an accurate ledger
[14:18:13] <theholyduck> :D
[14:18:29] <JesseDesu> keith ledger
[14:18:58] <theholyduck> Cryowolf: i have a gamespass suggestion for you if you want :P 
[14:19:02] *** Joins: jusski (~user@78-63-85-123.static.zebra.lt)
[14:19:04] <Cryowolf> obviously there's a way to buy bitcoins without anyone knowing it's you though. Unless they employ very strong expensive tactics
[14:19:07] <theholyduck> the entire dishonored series is on gamespass. 
[14:19:27] <theholyduck> Cryowolf: sure but only if you are buying the bitcoin in cash from somebody who doesnt know you
[14:19:38] <theholyduck> and theres not a lof of those people who really deal in bitcoin
[14:19:45] <Cryowolf> eeh...Not sure about that one, right now I want a more relaxing method
[14:20:03] <Cryowolf> I could also "tumble" them or whatever it's called
[14:20:33] <Cryowolf> and then have em sent to another wallet afterwards, with no logs at the tumbler
[14:20:49] <theholyduck> that involves trusting the service doing the "tumbling" 
[14:21:01] <theholyduck> and the fact that they dont actually keep records
[14:21:06] <Cryowolf> yes it needs to be very reputable
[14:21:13] <theholyduck> but it cant be
[14:21:19] <theholyduck> because doing something like that is BLATANTLY illegal
[14:21:25] <theholyduck> in most times and places 
[14:21:36] <Cryowolf> so is what I would use them for
[14:21:40] <Cryowolf> in most times and places
[14:22:01] <theholyduck> i think my point is maybe just try and buy your illegal thing with just cash. 
[14:22:10] <theholyduck> rather than trying to go via bitcoin'
[14:22:42] <theholyduck> or if its not illegal EVERYWHERE: maybe just getting on a plane and going somewhere where its legal
[14:23:18] <Cryowolf> No. While I'm not gonna discuss the details here, let's just say it's half the quality at twice the price and you might just get robbed instead
[14:23:44] <Cryowolf> smuggling it into Sweden is such a bigger crime than buying it here
[14:23:57] <Cryowolf> it's years and years in prison instead of a fine
[14:24:11] <theholyduck> buying it with bitcoin and having it shipped to you counts as smuggling aswell though
[14:24:18] <theholyduck> im pretty sure
[14:24:24] <Cryowolf> not really, it's shipped domestically
[14:24:24] <theholyduck> asuming you arent buying from swedish sources
[14:24:35] <Cryowolf> the entire site only allows Swedish sources
[14:24:37] <theholyduck> well at that point. why cant you just give your domestic source nice untracable swedish cash
[14:24:52] <theholyduck> rather than easily tracable bitcoin?
[14:24:56] <Cryowolf> because they only accept btc
[14:25:08] <Cryowolf> how would I give them the cash?
[14:25:29] <DunceCotus> envelope
[14:25:31] <Cryowolf> not like they would ever give me an address
[14:25:40] <Cryowolf> yeah cause that's how you survive in that business
[14:25:44] <DunceCotus> meet in a par
[14:25:46] <DunceCotus> *park
[14:25:47] <Cryowolf> advertise your address
[14:26:51] <Cryowolf> you don't have that communication, but it's a bit like a former very famous site on the dark web (still alive in different versions)
[14:26:52] <DunceCotus> paypal?
[14:26:58] <Cryowolf> only it's Swedish only
[14:27:18] <Cryowolf> paypal would also advertise it, even worse
[14:28:03] <Cryowolf> they only allow crypto, btc is all I think
[14:28:21] <Cryowolf> that's just how it is
[14:30:06] <Cryowolf> but Im ready to just buy with my creditcard, send to a wallet and then use it without caring if it's traced and I'm arrested. I would only end up with a fine anyway, or a warning. If they even bother at all

[14:32:14] <DunceCotus> seems cacophonous
[14:32:37] <theholyduck> and like they will take your drivers liscence even if you have LEGALLY used illegal drugs
[14:32:58] <DunceCotus> legally used illegal drugs?
[14:33:05] <theholyduck> like some people have medical weed from european prescriptions that norway has to respect
[14:33:07] <Cryowolf> theholyduck, I dont have a drivers license and with my cancer I just don't give a shit if they arrest me
[14:33:24] *** Joins: Matt|home (~matt@adsl-74-233-58-121.mia.bellsouth.net)
[14:33:31] <theholyduck> but just having one of them the police can and will rock up to your door and just take your drivers lisence
[14:33:35] <theholyduck> because you could potential drive high
[14:33:49] <Cryowolf> funny they dont do that with alcohol
[14:33:49] <theholyduck> its absurd
[14:33:54] <theholyduck> Cryowolf: funny indeed
[14:34:15] <DunceCotus> alkyhowl
[14:34:51] <DunceCotus> theholyduck: so they have guilty until proven innocent?
[14:35:14] <DunceCotus> I suppose if you are taking medical cannabis all the time it could mean perpetually impaired driving
[14:35:17] <Cryowolf> I might be able to get marinol or whatever that stuff is called, the synthetic medication not the extract
[14:35:24] <theholyduck> the police is just allowed to take your liscence if they think you are not a "sober person" in general
[14:35:39] <theholyduck> on  no evidence
[14:36:08] <DunceCotus> theholyduck: odd
[14:36:48] <Cryowolf> my oncologist can prescribe me anything that has a trial (ongoing or past that wasn't cancelled), if I can convince her of medical cannabis, I might end up with marinol or something (at no cost to me)
[14:37:16] <theholyduck> DunceCotus: recenty a coutt even ordered the police to give a liscence back to somebody
[14:37:19] <theholyduck> and they refused
[14:37:31] <theholyduck> DunceCotus: norwegian police are completely out of control when it comes to drug related ANYTHING
[14:37:56] <theholyduck> another recent scandals were they were ssearching behind the ballsacks of 14 year old boys. on the street in full public view
[14:37:58] <Cryowolf> Swedish police too
[14:38:11] <theholyduck> which they are legally not even remotely allowed to do
[14:38:16] <Cryowolf> but now they've begun focusing on the source

[14:39:28] <Cryowolf> I want drugs decriminalized, but not legalized (I think it's too soon for that, except medical)
[14:39:29] <theholyduck> the biggest oponent parties to the previous attempts at drug bills are dooing badly in the polls
[14:39:53] <Cryowolf> reason I want them decriminalized is because right now a lot of addicts avoid seeking help because they will get an arrest record
[14:39:54] <theholyduck> Cryowolf:  meh if you are going to decrimanlize it you might as well legalize it and get tax revenues and goverment quality control
[14:40:12] <theholyduck> like maybe not legalize like heroin or whatever
[14:40:21] <Cryowolf> no, decriminalizing means you dont get a criminal record that might ruin any attempt at a life after rehab
[14:40:28] <DunceCotus> durgs
[14:40:33] <theholyduck> but i do think like weed. mushrooms. lsd. maybe even MDMA should just be legal. 
[14:40:49] <Cryowolf> and if you can't establish a life with a job etc after becoming clean, you're going to relapse
[14:40:54] <DunceCotus> theholyduck: don't most 14 year olds keep drugs behind their ballsacks?
[14:41:11] <Cryowolf> and getting a job with a criminal record, is hard
[14:41:14] <theholyduck> DunceCotus:  maybe maybe not. but if you are going to search behind their balllasacks maybe do it with the consent of the parents in private
[14:41:27] <theholyduck> Cryowolf: dunno how seden does it but in norway theyh ide criminal record
[14:41:31] <theholyduck> from employers
[14:41:35] <theholyduck> unless its strictly relevant

[14:43:36] <theholyduck> for when i worked in a school
[14:43:50] <theholyduck> and so the school had a list of specific provisions of the criminal code they asked about
[14:43:55] <Cryowolf> so are drug related crimes
[14:43:58] <theholyduck> and the police would judge how relevant those specfici provisions were

[14:44:39] <DunceCotus> Cryowolf: charities only prolong the problem
[14:44:45] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: hey
[14:45:21] <Cryowolf> I didn't mean the people donating, I meant the people working there. The amount of arrests of sexual predators in such institutions is really high
[14:46:07] <Cryowolf> theholyduck, well here, if you're arrested for drugs, nobody will hire you. Until it goes away after 5 years
[14:46:20] <Cryowolf> I wouldnt say nobody, but fewer would
[14:46:23] <DunceCotus> Cryowolf: love is predatorial?
[14:46:26] <theholyduck> yeah im glad norway hides those
[14:46:58] <Cryowolf> but right now I dont care if I were to be arrested. I live on disability anyway so no job
[14:47:07] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: that's not real love
[14:47:27] <Cryowolf> and I only want it to help with some cancer pains and such, psychological and physical
[14:47:31] <DunceCotus> what's real love?
[14:48:04] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: well, one condition is between consenting adults
[14:48:23] <Cryowolf> the pains arent from the cancer technically, rather from surgery and a navel hernia and complicated healing off my abdominal muscles and some pain where my spleen used to be
[14:48:26] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: for intimate relationships
[14:48:28] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: only adults?
[14:48:42] <amigojapan> Yes DunceCotus 
[14:48:51] <DunceCotus> why so?
[14:49:27] <DunceCotus> if consent is possible
[14:49:39] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: cause you can't decide to get into a long term relationship when you are a kid. And sex is illegal
[14:49:52] <DunceCotus> you can't because why?
[14:49:53] <Cryowolf> meanwhile they pump me full of oxycodone but freak out at the thought of cannabis
[14:50:26] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: you are not mature enough to make the decision
[14:50:28] <Cryowolf> because a child doesn't have enough maturity and life experience to understand and make an educated decision of consent
[14:51:37] <Cryowolf> because they're a child and you don't abuse children. That's the last thing you do. I consider murderers to be better than child rapists
[14:51:56] <DunceCotus> sounds like bad education
[14:52:17] <DunceCotus> maturity isn't necessary for consent
[14:52:50] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: well the law agrees it is
[14:53:02] <Cryowolf> and my morals do too
[14:53:23] <Cryowolf> I joke about loli's and all, but make no mistake, I loathe child abusers
[14:54:09] <tyawp> amigojapan: what age do you think child becomes an adult? the age of concent?
[14:54:23] <amigojapan> tyawp: about 30
[14:54:40] <DunceCotus> see this is the danger
[14:54:55] <tyawp> lol
[14:55:15] <DunceCotus> by having age of consent as a fixed number, you invariably have to exclude a bunch of people from society
[14:55:26] <Cryowolf> sure if you have pedophilia and never touch, nor ever want to touch a child. It's not that persons fault they were born with their brain wired in a fucked up way. I'd be wary of them around my kids still though (I dont have kids but if I did), but unless they've harmed a child then I'd rather see that they're allowed to seek help, therapy, medicine, whatever. So that their risk of ever harming a child is reduced
[14:55:50] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: being prohibited from sex does not exclude you from society

[14:56:06] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: actually it does
[14:56:21] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: it excludes people from knowledge
[14:56:23] <Cryowolf> You also have the ability to not be a rapist no matter what age or sex you're attracted to
[14:56:36] <DunceCotus> and then we say  they're not mature enough to understand.. well they're not given the opportunity
[14:56:50] *** Joins: swagneko (~bit@user/nekobit)
[14:57:01] <Cryowolf> are you arguing sincerely or just for the sake of being contrarian?
[14:57:11] <amigojapan> tyawp: when you reach my age you notice many people are still kids before 30
[14:57:12] <DunceCotus> no i'm passionate about this
[14:57:57] <tyawp> amigojapan: how old are you? roughly?
[14:57:58] <Cryowolf> what is tyawp?
[14:58:02] <Cryowolf> oh
[14:58:04] <Cryowolf> a person
[14:58:10] <amigojapan> tyawp: 43 and a half
[14:58:16] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: I was capable of making decisions between 10 and 30.. not sure what you're going on abou
[14:58:17] <tyawp> Cryowolf: :)
[14:58:55] <DunceCotus> wise decisions? Sometimes yes, sometimes no
[14:58:57] <DunceCotus> same with adults
[14:59:00] <Cryowolf> DunceCotus, I thought I was at the age of 10 or whatnot, but I'm pretty sure it would have messed me up for life
[14:59:00] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: I don't think you make very good decisions now. Look at your world view, it's messed up
[14:59:13] <DunceCotus> adults can be educated to extremes and still make stupid regrettable decisions
[14:59:13] <tyawp> maybe you're right.  almost every human is child even when they're an adult in law.
[14:59:43] <DunceCotus> Cryowolf: why would it have messed you up?
[15:00:37] <DunceCotus> the 'messing up' is precisely due to this violent demarcation between adult and child
[15:00:53] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: in ancient Greece, pedophilia was considered acceptable
[15:00:55] <DunceCotus> and I say violent because it is society forcing someone to act like an adult
[15:01:25] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: this goes beyond sex even
[15:01:32] <DunceCotus> kids don't get the vote
[15:01:41] <tyawp> I heard that the virgin mary was 14 when she delivers Jesus.
[15:01:43] <Cryowolf> amigojapan, in ancient rome though that changed
[15:01:43] <DunceCotus> they are forced to live by their parents' or teachers' decisions
[15:01:57] <amigojapan> I see Cryowolf 
[15:02:02] <Cryowolf> amigojapan, except for slaves cause they weren't considered to be people, they were considered property
[15:02:10] <Cryowolf> and property has no legal right
[15:02:21] <amigojapan> Gotcha Cryowolf 
[15:02:59] <DunceCotus> I don't like talking about 'ancient' history cause we really do not know
[15:03:18] <Cryowolf> ancient rome had age of consent at 14 for women and 16 for men (because thats the age they can enlist and truly be called a man, thus even if their physical maturity would allow, the law wouldn't oblige)
[15:03:41] <Cryowolf> ancient rome we do know, there are documentation surrounding it

[15:04:19] <DunceCotus> its likely we only have crumbs of actual history
[15:04:40] <DunceCotus> glued together with narratives from social engineers
[15:04:55] <Cryowolf> obviously, the documentation we've recovered only span certain years
[15:04:56] <amigojapan> In this I agree with DunceCotus .I don't believe in "history
[15:05:01] <Cryowolf> or even regions
[15:06:10] <DunceCotus> cataclysms forced creative rewriting of history
[15:06:15] <Cryowolf> but if there is archeological evidence of something existing at a certain place and time, I believe it to be correct that it did. If the source, the one who wrote it was someone of note and not some scrap

[15:07:04] <DunceCotus> archaeology has to go beyond rubble and ruins
[15:07:17] <DunceCotus> time changes reality itself
[15:07:19] <Cryowolf> I believe Historians are the ones filling in the gaps with their own creativity, while the archeologists objectively analyze what is there and present it
[15:07:52] <DunceCotus> there is no objectivity whether you look at the physical ruins or the historical record
[15:08:01] <Cryowolf> historians use what exists to try and deduce what happened
[15:08:06] <amigojapan> Cryowolf: Wikipedia says "The first recorded age-of-consent law dates from 1275 in England; as part of its provisions on rape, the Statute of Westminster 1275 made it a"
[15:08:43] <DunceCotus> rage of consent
[15:09:03] <Cryowolf> yes there is, if you simply present what you find after you carbon date it and all, that's objective. Whether or not what's written in it is true or accurate isn't their job to find out
[15:09:39] <DunceCotus> Cryowolf: that implies a fixed reality
[15:09:46] <DunceCotus> unchanging physical laws
[15:09:54] <DunceCotus> everything we dig up now, is part of the now
[15:10:22] <DunceCotus> it is only a trace of the past, and a trace as interpolated through our reality prism
[15:10:27] <Cryowolf> You sound worse then Joe Rogan when he talks about DMT
[15:10:43] <amigojapan> Cryowolf: DunceCotus is a bit crazy when it comes to his world view
[15:12:32] <Cryowolf> a bit schizoaffective perhaps
[15:12:35] <DunceCotus> Cryowolf: Joe Rogan is a shill
[15:13:03] <Cryowolf> I don't know what he is except that he's now very rich
[15:13:23] <DunceCotus> only way to get rich in this reality is to be a shill
[15:13:28] <amigojapan> Cryowolf: he keeps on bridging up that he believes in the Mandela effect
[15:14:00] <Cryowolf> I think the mandela effect is a fascinating concept, but just that, a concept
[15:14:03] <Cryowolf> I don't believe it's real
[15:14:13] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: Mandela Effect or its cause is a key factor in considering history
[15:14:33] <DunceCotus> Cryowolf: its very real
[15:15:19] <DunceCotus> however its not something we can readily understand, yes there's a schizo element
[15:15:59] <Cryowolf> DunceCotus, I didn't mean for that to be an insult or demeaning
[15:16:24] <DunceCotus> Cryowolf: ok
[15:16:55] <Cryowolf> so if you felt hurt by what I said, I'm sorry
[15:17:47] <DunceCotus> I'd like to think i'm made of stronger stuff
[15:19:59] <amigojapan> Cryowolf: DunceCotus wishes the idea of the Mandela effect being real is false. But he really believes it is real
[15:21:08] <davic> Cryowolf: sir
[15:21:10] <davic> Rimi sucks
[15:21:19] <amigojapan> Cryowolf: he also believes dreams are part of reality
[15:22:12] <Cryowolf> davic, Rimi?
[15:22:28] <davic> Cryowolf: Rimi Baltic, ICA's brand in Baltics
[15:22:50] <Cryowolf> ah, I didn't know about that
[15:23:00] <davic> They dont have skavsårsplåster
[15:23:24] <Cryowolf> do they have hydrocolloid?
[15:23:48] <davic> Cryowolf: no
[15:23:53] <davic> not even Coop Eesti does
[15:24:01] <Cryowolf> the pharmacies i mean
[15:24:02] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: its all part of reality
[15:24:35] <DunceCotus> dreams are just like a location we can't visit currently in physical form
[15:24:43] <Cryowolf> pharmacies should have hydrocolloid, I love them when I have some kind of issue with my feet. They help heal the wound and they function like a second layer of skin
[15:25:20] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: its like how a dog doesn't understand the concept of Paris
[15:25:23] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: rules of physics brake down in dreams. I have also died many times in dreams
[15:25:35] <davic> Cryowolf: I can check with Apotheka
[15:25:40] <DunceCotus> they may understand 'ball' or 'walkies' but something more abstract like Paris is lost to them
[15:25:46] <davic> Everything is in estonian tho or russian
[15:25:49] <DunceCotus> there are concepts like these for humans too
[15:26:28] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: such rules are limited to our territorial horizon
[15:27:04] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: think of it like moving without physically moving
[15:27:26] <DunceCotus> it seems impossible but only within a certain horizon of territorialisation
[15:27:42] <Cryowolf> davic, they're self-adhesive compress that are borderless and attach to the skin but doesnt adhere to wounds, they act like a secondary skin while creating an atmosphere for the wound to deal
[15:28:07] <davic> Futuristic shit 
[15:28:14] <DunceCotus> one thing is clear: dreams are not 'just' imagination
[15:28:29] <DunceCotus> they are imagination only insofar as waking reality is imagination
[15:28:41] <DunceCotus> partially at best, ancillary
[15:29:42] <Cryowolf> https://www.apotekhjartat.se/produkt/duoderm-bandage-1/ something like this davic, they're amazing. During chemo my feet would blister a lot and large pieces of skin would become blistered and come off. I couldn't walk without intense pain. So I used that

[15:29:49] <Cryowolf> and then I could walk normally
[15:30:05] <Cryowolf> duoderm exists in a lot of countries around Europe too
[15:30:56] <Cryowolf> and extra thin is the best cause the thicker one just starts to roll up, so unless its a very very serious wound, get extra thin
[15:32:29] <Cryowolf> well I used something called Hydrocoll, cause it's cheaper. They had 10 bandages of 10x10 for 190 sek

[17:57:45] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: you're gay
[17:57:59] <DunceCotus> you are gay.
[17:58:05] <DunceCotus> (kidding)
[17:58:11] <isekaijin> Not saying that it is “morally wrong” or anything, but somehow a boy playing with Barbie dolls seems weird. Unless you are pretending you are mutilating someone, and the Barbie doll just happened to be the nearest victim.
[17:58:46] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: no . Gay sex as also creeps me out
[17:58:50] <DunceCotus> I'm 90% gay and didn't play with barbies, but I can see the appeal
[17:59:06] <Bco1981> you could say i still play with barbie dolls... just in 3d
[17:59:16] <DunceCotus> Bco1981: you are straight.

[18:02:42] <Bco1981> even add sound effects

[18:07:00] <DunceCotus> eg. Kaworu
[18:07:37] <isekaijin> Argh, got scrolled up.
[18:07:41] <DunceCotus> what I didn't like about Barbie line was all the pink
[18:07:47] <DunceCotus> like why do girls go in for that
[18:07:48] <Bco1981> isekaijin: yes, i was just refering to a 3d model, which is practically the same, just not physical.

[18:09:10] <DunceCotus> isekaijin: I woldn't
[18:09:31] <Bco1981> i wan't to take it a step further and be able to record my movements and load that on models... but most equipment for that is expensive.
[18:10:01] <isekaijin> DunceCotus: Apparently, being a fujoshi is rather common among girls. They just do not tell us guys, because... uh... it is obvious why.
[18:10:06] <Bco1981> $2K for something for "fun" is too much.
[18:10:16] <DunceCotus> isekaijin: cause guys are homophobic?

[18:10:39] <DunceCotus> oh?
[18:11:03] <DunceCotus> Bco1981: modern day algorithms + webcam should suffice

[18:20:10] <Bco1981> i wouldn't say i'm homophobic, i can talk with them and work with one were i work now. i don't care what they stick their dick in... aslong as it isn't me.
[18:20:30] <DunceCotus> Bco1981: what if its a simulacra of you
[18:21:52] <Bco1981> a simulation isn't me.
[18:22:20] <Bco1981> can look like, sound like, and act like... but it isn't "me".

[18:28:56] <Bco1981> i can, but the vr is hard to route
[18:29:00] <ButterNoodle> tru
[18:29:17] <ButterNoodle> I was thinking about what it would take to run it across the network
[18:29:30] <Bco1981> usb3.0 can do it
[18:29:34] <Bco1981> 5gbps
[18:29:42] <ButterNoodle> but then realized that a few ms of jitter would be fucked up
[18:29:46] <Bco1981> the problem will be latency
[18:29:56] <ButterNoodle> latency/jitter
[18:30:00] <Bco1981> yeah
[18:30:01] <ButterNoodle> consistent latency is fine
[18:30:38] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: I feel, enjoying looking at muscular guys is gay, that's why I rather be looking always at cute girls
[18:31:22] <Bco1981> ButterNoodle: but aslong as it is at a home network, from one room to another. should be no problem.
[18:31:45] <amigojapan> Hey ButterNoodle 
[18:31:55] <ButterNoodle> amigojapan: if you always look at buff men.. then you will desensitize yourself to an attraction to men.. leaving urself with only an attraction to women.. its probably the least gay thing you can do.
[18:31:55] <Bco1981> just need 10gbps home network
[18:31:59] <ButterNoodle> :)
[18:32:19] <ButterNoodle> Bco1981: ez just get one of those 100$ brocade vdx's like I have

[18:41:11] <ButterNoodle> see
[18:41:15] <DunceCotus> but after stopping that, what you come back to is what you're sexually into
[18:41:38] <Ashl3y4> Yea I am :P amigojapan

[18:42:19] <ButterNoodle> damn
[18:42:28] <DunceCotus> so boys can watch a lot of muscular men but that doesn't necessarily make them straight due to desensitisation
[18:42:37] <DunceCotus> nothing conscious makes us gay/straight/etc.
[18:42:54] <DunceCotus> ButterNoodle: I see
[18:43:27] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: but maybe that see the muscular men as sexually attractive and that is why they watch them
[18:43:36] <ButterNoodle> that just triggered some dream recall.. I was looking at some old photos of decommed military housing near me and had dream last night being there with my cute cousin as a kid..

[20:34:52] <amigojapan> tyawp: I met my wife in Kyoto by the way
[20:35:08] <tyawp> amigojapan: oh, I was in Kyoto.

[20:45:27] <emmeka> TsundereNoises my wife wanted to watch that anime the other day.
[20:45:38] <TsundereNoises> emmeka: I really like it!
[20:45:45] <Guest39> Why do males watch girly anime stuff?
[20:45:57] <emmeka> TsundereNoises this was her choice instead, that we're currently watching: https://myanimelist.net/anime/10396/Ben-To

[20:46:21] <emmeka> Guest39 why don't you?
[20:46:22] <tyawp> amigojapan: 東寺庵? I know touji and visited several times but still don't know that hostel.
[20:46:35] <Guest39> I like violence and in-depth storylines. 
[20:46:44] <Bco1981> emmeka: hmm, it's not THAT good... but it is good fun.
[20:46:52] <amigojapan> tyawp: yeah. It's the same owner of touji
[20:46:54] <TsundereNoises> emmeka: honestly I'm kind of sold just from the cover image
[20:46:59] <emmeka> Guest39 do you think plots involving women are incapable of being in depth?
[20:47:15] <tyawp> I was in Sakyo-ku where Kyoto university is.
[20:47:39] <Guest39> It could be. But on the surface they seem lame.
[20:47:40] <Bco1981> Guest39: you have no idea how deep they can be.
[20:47:49] <Guest39> How is watching manly anime gay?
[20:47:57] <Guest39> Girly anime doesn't click with me

[20:48:34] <amigojapan> Guest39: if you like to look at muscular guys note than girly girls, that's gay
[20:48:39] <tyawp> amigojapan: I thought Touji is some kind of cultural properties so it's owned by the Japanese government.
[20:49:05] <darkwitch> violence and fighting is no good Guest39
[20:49:09] <Guest39> But the type of stuff you guys watch is weird IMO
[20:49:12] <Guest39> It's like Sailor Moon
[20:49:13] <amigojapan> No. It is privately owned tyawp 
[20:49:20] <emmeka> Guest39 my opinion would be that a lot of the action anime out there have extremely dull and repetitive plots, but that "girly" anime either 1) don't need a plot because it's a SoL series and nobody's there for the plot 2) have a pretty intricate plot with juicy love triangles and various dramatic backstories, betrayals etc
[20:49:22] <Guest39> Just my opinion. No intent to offend.
[20:49:28] <tyawp> amigojapan: I didn't know that. TIL.
[20:49:47] <amigojapan> Guest39: sailor moon is my favourite anime
[20:50:02] <emmeka> Guest39 also, really, Sailor Moon is a bad example. Sailor Moon is basically all fighting.
[20:50:21] <emmeka> interspersed with crying and chasing boys
[20:50:26] <emmeka> but still
[20:50:29] <Guest39> Why do males watch it?
[20:50:36] <emmeka> because it's great?
[20:50:37] <Guest39> Like chasing boys n' stuff. That's weird IMO
[20:50:41] <darkwitch> that's what magical girls do
[20:50:55] <Roey> they want to identify with the guy being chased
[20:51:02] <Guest39> I see.
[20:51:03] <TsundereNoises> Guest39: I mean it seems like you haven't really watched much girly anime?
[20:51:09] <emmeka> idk anyone who wants to identify with Tuxedo Mask
[20:51:16] <emmeka> he gets kidnapped constantly and loses every fight
[20:51:30] <TsundereNoises> Guest39: but it's not really one genre either, in the same way as anime with dudes in it isn't really one genre
[20:51:32] <emmeka> but I did name my rabbit after Tuxedo Mask when I was 8
[20:51:32] <amigojapan> Guest39: IMO of you like stuff like first of the North Star, that is weird
[20:51:42] <TsundereNoises> 3-gatsu no Lion and One Piece are pretty different
[20:51:43] <emmeka> or more like 10, I guess
[20:52:07] <TsundereNoises> emmeka: Tuxedo Mask is a damsel in distress
[20:52:14] <emmeka> literally, though
[20:53:00] <Guest39> The culture can get a bit weird. Like Waifu dolls. WTF.

[20:53:26] <emmeka> Guest39 are we still talking about "girly anime"
[20:53:27] <TsundereNoises> Guest39: I don't have a waifu, but 90% of the anime I watch has no important male characters
[20:53:32] <Guest39> If it's something you enjoy then I respect it.
[20:53:33] <emmeka> because then they'd be husbandos
[20:53:34] <Bco1981> !a Waifu dolls
[20:53:34] <ImoutoBot> Bco1981: I don't recognize that anime.
[20:53:38] <Bco1981> oh

[20:53:50] <Jigsy> TsundereNoises: No waifu, no laifu.
[20:54:13] <emmeka> Guest39 but really, do you find any plot with a woman as MC and that potentially explores any aspect of femininity to be unwatcheable?
[20:54:29] <emmeka> because that probably says more about you than it does about the anime, and you should give it a more serious try
[20:54:35] <Bco1981> i guess my waifu is Miku, but not her standard version.
[20:54:56] <TsundereNoises> emmeka: I haven't read this, but I was trying to remember the name of a cooking manga and found it, and I like the character design/art style of this a lot and think I should read it just on that? https://www.anime-planet.com/images/manga/covers/60106.jpg?t=1612685312

[21:20:50] <TsundereNoises> Hidamari is very interesting, art-wise
[21:21:08] <TsundereNoises> I wonder if it's the best cgdct show for someone we're trying to sell on the concept though?

[21:30:08] <Bco1981> there is many so i guess, yes
[21:30:40] <Bco1981> Guest39: again if you don't understand CGDCT you won't get vtubers.
[21:30:54] <Guest39> Bco1981 What's there to understand?
[21:32:51] <Guest39> My guess is you get attracted to the characters.
[21:34:40] <darkwitch> do you get attracted to humans?
[21:35:16] <Guest39> Potentially, they are real
[21:35:37] <Roey> "only when they burn" what the hell does that mean??
[21:35:46] <darkwitch> has it happened yet, or is it just theory?
[21:36:54] <Guest39> I guess I can see how you can develop affection for a anime character
[21:37:24] <TsundereNoises> Guest39: I don't watch anything because I'm attracted to the characters
[21:37:29] <TsundereNoises> although plenty are charming
[21:37:31] <TsundereNoises> but that's different
[21:37:39] <darkwitch> yes, but you need to care about humans first, and not their ability to fight
[21:38:07] <TsundereNoises> Guest39: I'm engaged, I'm not replacing real life with fictional 2d characters, and yet I mostly only watch things with cute girls
[21:38:22] <Guest39> Wow, interesting
[21:38:37] <TsundereNoises> amigo and emmeka are both married and also both prefer girly shit
[21:39:06] <TsundereNoises> Guest39: so I think your psychological profile is pretty off
[21:39:14] <TsundereNoises> of why people watch what they watch
[21:39:44] <Jigsy> I watch hentai for the plot.
[21:40:30] <Guest39> Really?
[21:40:42] <TsundereNoises> Bco1981: It's a good thing Nene added that beep sound underneath her saying poop
[21:40:46] <TsundereNoises> I'd be offended otherwise
[21:42:17] <TsundereNoises> Guest39: so we recommended a bunch of different shows, which do you think you'll try?
[21:43:34] <Guest39> Maybe Kill la Kill
[21:44:00] <TsundereNoises> have you seen Gurren Lagann?
[21:44:06] <TsundereNoises> speaking of "manly" anie
[21:44:08] <TsundereNoises> anime
[21:44:17] <Guest39> No I haven't -- looks interesting
[21:44:43] <TsundereNoises> that's a show that I actually think is pretty great, despite being about manliness and explosions and drills
[21:44:46] <TsundereNoises> mostly drills
[21:45:15] <TsundereNoises> anyway, I've always thought Kill la Kill is sort of a weird gender-flipped inversion of it, both are kind of thematically about puberty?
[21:45:29] <TsundereNoises> or adolescence anyway

[22:08:36] <emmeka> I'm trying to think of a series that's very "girly" but that Guest39 might like regardless
[22:08:46] <emmeka> Yona of the Dawn?
[22:09:07] <Bco1981> why do people think arugula is foods for humans.
[22:09:08] <TsundereNoises> emmeka: I was thinking Flip Flappers or Princess Principal in that logic
[22:09:13] <emmeka> it has a lot of action. unfortunately the anime is incomplete, and it'll make you want to read the manga, but still
[22:09:41] <Vohveli> they usually get their channels restored pretty quickly, must still be stressful as fuck
[22:09:42] <TsundereNoises> emmeka: I also need to fight the urge to just duct tape people to a chair, hold their eyes open, and make them watch Pretty Cure until they fucking like it
[22:09:46] <TsundereNoises> whenever these conversations come up
[22:10:29] <Urchin[emacs]> lol
[22:10:36] <Bco1981> TsundereNoises: lol
[22:12:08] <emmeka> Guest39 I guess I'll stick with that rec. Watch Yona of the Dawn. That's as good a gateway to shoujo for an action lover as any anime.

[22:12:44] <emmeka> the OVAs do it a bit more justice
[22:13:01] <Urchin[emacs]> Akagami no Shirayuki-hime is pretty good too
[22:13:04] <Bco1981> but the story is still just started.
[22:13:05] <TsundereNoises> honestly probably needs like a 3rd and 4th season too doesn't it?
[22:13:19] <TsundereNoises> Yeah Shirayuki is good too
[22:13:34] <TsundereNoises> this is the problem, "girly anime" is… 95% of everything good
[22:13:42] <emmeka> Shirayuki is also good but isn't as hefty on the action or action-y plot as Yona is

[22:21:05] <Urchin[emacs]> IDK, never saw Pokémon as particularly super-manly
[22:21:11] <emmeka> Guest39 the label you're using is a bit broad. There's a lot of anime you'd probably call "girly" which is targetted squarely at men, and then there's the archetypal shoujo anime which are targetted at teenage girls
[22:21:20] <Bco1981> Aurora_v_kosmose: Lamy?
[22:21:28] <Bco1981> her new outfit

[22:21:59] <Aurora_v_kosmose> It's pretty adorb
[22:22:04] <Urchin[emacs]> also, there's Nana, which is considered shoujo, which is about sex, drugs and punk rock
[22:22:19] <Urchin[emacs]> that's an anime for girls

[23:15:41] <xD-> next upgrade is widevine DRM like netflix
[23:15:43] <emmeka> xD- it's k though, this just means that there's less fuckery between US and international release dates, more and quicker dubs, and less services people have to actually keep tabs on. And it's not as if Sony has a monopoly now, so we're still fine.
[23:15:49] <xD-> so they protect their content even more

[23:17:05] <emmeka> xD there's still Sentai Filmworks running Hidive which has been doing well recently, and then there's Viz which still licenses things independently, and then there's Netflix with their bullshit licensing of anime too

[23:17:52] <emmeka> Roey yep.
[23:17:54] <Roey> crunchyroll? wow.
[23:18:07] <Roey> when did they do that?
[23:18:26] <xD-> some time ago
[23:18:31] <Roey> ahhhh
[23:18:34] <emmeka> Roey negotiations had been ongoing for months, but they bought it for real a few weeks ago and announced their intention to merge Funimation and Crunchyroll into one service
[23:18:40] <emmeka> nah it was recent xD-

[23:19:05] <emmeka> Roey Sony has always owned Funimation.
[23:19:05] <Roey> ah
[23:19:09] <emmeka> or well, has for many years now
[23:19:18] <Roey> emmeka: I meant, they just bought the competition out striaght.
[23:19:21] <xD-> i dont like it
[23:19:22] <Roey> straight.
[23:19:33] <Roey> i dont like sony
[23:19:42] <Roey> or at&t
[23:19:43] <Roey> or verizon
[23:19:44] <Roey> or comcast
[23:19:47] <xD-> haha
[23:19:59] <emmeka> AT&T owned Crunchyroll, so.
[23:19:59] <Roey> unfortunatley they're expanding in the content direction
[23:20:01] *** Quits: swagneko (~bit@user/nekobit) (Remote host closed the connection)
[23:20:06] <TsundereNoises> yeah I don't see how this is a good thing really
[23:20:22] <xD-> and the DRM upgrade soon
[23:20:25] <emmeka> TsundereNoises it's fine, it's not a monopoly and it's good for various things
[23:20:36] <xD-> so i cant use kodi for some time
[23:20:37] <Roey> xD-: DRM upgrade on what.. on just the PS5?
[23:20:46] <emmeka> Funimation has been way better at some things than Crunchyroll, and the Crunchy/Funimation breakup was annoying.
[23:20:48] <TsundereNoises> I mean, I still download most things because the official subs are legitimately worse on lots of shows still
[23:20:51] *** Joins: swagneko (~bit@user/nekobit)
[23:20:59] <xD-> Roey: crunchy was almost no DRM even youtube-dl works
[23:21:31] <xD-> Roey: which is fair so you can have custom clients
[23:21:33] <emmeka> xD- if anything this'll be great for pirates. Funimation releases *everything* they license on Bluray.
[23:21:38] <emmeka> Crunchyroll does not.
[23:21:45] <emmeka> expect BDrips of Crunchyroll titles now.
[23:22:01] <xD-> i see
[23:22:27] <xD-> well in the end bluray gets pirated anyway
[23:22:41] <emmeka> higher quality rips than webrips, too
[23:22:54] <xD-> still bad development happening
[23:23:05] <emmeka> it's also great for dub watchers, Crunchyroll only dubs a handful of series each season and is slow about it, Funimation dubs everything always
[23:23:11] <TsundereNoises> as fewer people bother to fansub, I wish official subs would be better
[23:23:21] <TsundereNoises> not like Funi/Crunchy have been good for that really
[23:23:35] <xD-> CR doesnt have app for tizen os
[23:23:41] <xD-> they suck
[23:23:42] <TsundereNoises> the big shows get good subs fast, the small shows often get terrible subs
[23:24:03] <xD-> so you cant watch it with samsung tvs
[23:24:18] <emmeka> xD- I don't really see the downside of the merger for us. It's more content spread over less services. I could see the concern if it was a monopoly, but it isn't, this will in fact force Sony to play ball with other licensors just due to Crunchy's existing obligations.
[23:24:35] <xD-> emmeka: first merge then heavy DRM
[23:24:42] <xD-> emmeka: no more easy rip for kodi
[23:24:56] <emmeka> there's already DRM, and it doesn't matter because it's already ripped by plenty of people, just like Netflix shows are.

[23:25:33] <emmeka> Netflix shows aren't rare now when it comes to anime.
[23:25:40] <xD-> i mean widevine dumps
[23:25:43] <emmeka> they're getting a lot of exclusive licenses these days
[23:25:47] <xD-> they do reencode it
[23:26:06] <emmeka> anyway if your only concern is "it'll be slightly harder to steal" then w/e, the other ends of it are all upsides.
[23:26:33] <xD-> i dont want to login with official apps
[23:26:51] <xD-> DRM is enforcing you to do that
[23:26:53] <xD-> one day
[23:27:23] <TsundereNoises> as long as physical releases are a thing, I'm okay with whatever I guess
[23:27:25] <emmeka> xD- regardless, like I said, expect more high quality BDrips of former Crunchyroll exclusive titles
[23:27:32] <xD-> lets hope
[23:28:01] <emmeka> you don't really need to hope, Funimation does BDs of everything, presumably the merged company will too. It makes them money, so they'll keep doing it.
[23:28:10] <emmeka> BDs are surprisingly profitable for anime licensors
[23:28:23] <emmeka> Sentai Filmworks actually makes more off them than streaming revenue
[23:30:06] <xD-> i gave up at 12cm discs
[23:30:33] <xD-> bluray is only good if you rip it and OCR subs
