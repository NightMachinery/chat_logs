[00:22:29] <acdw> oh really? i haven't realy looked at it tbh
[00:22:32] <fnstudio> lisp123_: a tiny bit of scheme
[00:22:34] <acdw> i just like his blog posts
[00:22:41] <Aurora_v_kosmose> fnstudio: The FSF one is basically the standard Emacs manual on dead tree, for supporting purposes more so that inherent usefulness.
[00:22:55] <johnjay> his blog posts are very in depth, so the book TOC is weird since it makes it sound very easy beginnerish
[00:22:59] <Aurora_v_kosmose> (Since it's normally included with Emacs)
[00:23:30] <fnstudio> Aurora_v_kosmose: ah! i see... no right, i think i was looking for something with a bit more "narrative" than a tech manual, good point
[00:23:42] <lisp123_> fnstudio: that should be enough IMO. I found the best to learn elisp was to use Xah Lee's online guide because it gives you some basic functions very fast, then to play around with them, then start using C-h f, C-h k, C-h v and start getting under the hood of Emacs
[00:24:03] <lisp123_> The GNU elisp manual is very good, but I use it mostly to search for what I want to do - its too long to read from start to finish
[00:24:27] <Aurora_v_kosmose> It is written in large part as a reference manual.
[00:24:59] <lisp123_> Aurora_v_kosmose: Yeah and its great one at that, one of the best imo
[00:25:01] <Aurora_v_kosmose> You could say there's an unfilled gap between the newbie-tier intro manual and the reference manual.
[00:25:35] <lisp123_> For sure, it was very hard for me to connect the dots
[00:25:45] <lisp123_> But once I did, it was pretty straightforward
[00:25:48] <acdw> yea to learn elisp, C-h f and C-h v are very good friends
[00:25:58] <acdw> also helpful package
[00:27:07] <fnstudio> thanks lisp123_ Aurora_v_kosmose acdw very good points, i think it might make sense to hold on on the manuals for now and look more into mastering emacs plus blog posts
[00:27:40] <lisp123_> fnstudio: try this https://paste.debian.net/1206272/
[00:27:46] <fnstudio> i did like the idea of some dead tree (ouch... i know, that might not be the best for the env) book to read when afk
[00:27:54] <lisp123_> It's something I wrote, you can read through it and it will teach you a lot
[00:27:58] <lisp123_> if you google the terms
[00:28:08] <lisp123_> Ignore the large keybindings at the start though lol
[00:28:40] <Aurora_v_kosmose> It's often easier to remember the name of a seldom-used command than its keybinding.
[00:28:49] <acdw> truht
[00:28:54] <Aurora_v_kosmose> That's when stuff like vertico & ivy shine

[00:29:35] <fnstudio> lisp123_: this is *fantastic* thanks so much, i'll go through it and as you said it might be enough for me to break the initial barrier into elisp and then off i go from there
[00:30:43] <lisp123_> No worries :) Esp towards the end where it defines major & minor modes, try following them word for word first (but slightly changing) then once you get confident / google what is happening, you deviate much more
[00:31:25] <lisp123_> I'm not sure how much emacs you know - that would be important to learn first (i.e. what is a buffer, frame, what is point, what is a major mode, what is a minor mode, how do global variables work, etc.)

[00:38:30] <lisp123_> (as my last comment), I think the trick is to think of Emacs as an "API" - it has 100s of useful functions, you just need to know which one to use where - so you are less writing your own programs, but more taking advantage of the existing APIs

[13:51:47] <djm> wasamasa: I'm not sure I understand - there are packages that are both on github and in elpa (e.g. vertico and consult). Presumably the savannah repository is a mirror of the github one in those cases
[13:52:03] <djm> So "not github" doesn't seem like a huge barrier to entry
[13:53:06] <twb> "you don’t need to host your package in the ELPA git repo"
[13:53:15] <twb> Does that include submodules?
[13:53:35] <twb> For single-file elisp packages it's like "fuck it, whatever"
[13:54:22] <twb> But I can see there are stupid huge elisp apps that have like 500 files and do continuous integration and have jenkins and coverity and visual studio build scripts in their git repo
[13:54:46] <twb> Do people doing that have to send elpa project a pull request saying "please merge in my entire repo" ?

[13:57:03] <twb> btw note that sv.gnu.org is an ancient fork of sf.net (i.e. awful), and gitlab is "open core" (i.e. either awful or just as unfree as github)
[13:57:24] <twb> So the narrative remains "choose between convenience and freedom, or some ugly compromise in between"
[13:59:28] <wasamasa> djm: yeah, these packages have gotten into ELPA very early
[13:59:41] <wasamasa> djm: the problem is getting in the packages that aren't from FSF-aligned authors
[14:00:45] <twb> wasamasa: what is the ACTUAL problem?  That freedom-apathetic users have to enable melpa to get apps from freedom-apathetic developers?
[14:01:06] <djm> wasamasa: isn't that what NonGNU ELPA is for?
[14:01:18] <twb> wasamasa: I don't think the problem is 'melpa exists at all' because there's going to be at least a minority of holdouts who will NEVER put code into elpa
[14:01:48] <wasamasa> NonGNU ELPA merely removes the copyright assignment requirement
[14:01:58] <wasamasa> it doesn't remove the remaining effort 
[14:02:14] <wasamasa> you still have to do things the non-github way and communicate with FSF people and all that
[14:02:35] <jetty> good point
[14:02:46] <twb> wasamasa: is the effort more than "dear sv.nongnu.org, please mirror github.com/a/b to sv.nongnu.org/a/b"
[14:02:52] <wasamasa> yes
[14:02:56] <wasamasa> there is no mirroring
[14:03:02] <wasamasa> it's not automatic
[14:03:14] <twb> Is there any reason it CAN'T be that simple? 
[14:03:28] <twb> package.el doesn't have any bug reporting support, does it?
[14:03:33] <wasamasa> indeed
[14:03:46] <wasamasa> well, the reason is most likely FSF people being used to their ways
[14:03:47] <twb> And melpa at least has no concept of stable releases
[14:03:52] <wasamasa> simplifying them isn't an option
[14:04:08] <twb> wasamasa: that just means the script runs on a host that isn't sv.gnu.org
[14:04:10] <pkal> I'm confused what the issue is?
[14:04:30] <twb> pkal: I think the issue is "melpa is too popular because elpa is too hard"
[14:04:47] <wasamasa> nongnu elpa wants to become as popular as melpa, but fails
[14:04:56] <pkal> I have a few packages on ELPA and haven't had any issues?
[14:05:05] <wasamasa> do you develop them alone?
[14:05:37] <pkal> wasamasa: Well it doesn't have the packages yet, but I think that by having have added it to package-archives from Emacs 28 onwards will help
[14:05:38] <twb> I think of elpa as being a replacement for emacswiki.org's elisp dumping ground
[14:05:57] <pkal> wasamasa: Mostly, with some occasional external contributors 
[14:06:08] <twb> Although personally I don't use package.el AT ALL because it doesn't have good security or quality guarantees

[14:07:23] <twb> wasamasa: what does "FSF-aligned" mean
[14:07:33] <wasamasa> it may not mention evil things

[14:24:16] <twb> But it's much nicer for things like nginx -> webapp or webapp -> postgres/mysql
[14:24:16] <codingquark> Yeah, I better check what why k8s is not binding pod's port to host's port at all
[14:24:37] <pkal> wasamasa: no, usually a new release is created whenever the version tag is bumped
[14:24:45] <twb> is k8s based on unshare(2) or what?
[14:25:21] <twb> Because it's written in golang I wrote it off without doing any investigation
[14:25:25] <pkal> there are cases when certain packages don't have version tags and they have to be updated manually, but I'm trying to contact the projects to change that
[14:25:43] <codingquark> twb: wait, may be it is not supposed to bind to host port and the whole thing is just badly created container!

[14:31:01] <twb> For example, Ubuntu provides 5 years of support for syslinux, but 0 years of support for extlinux – even though they are built from the same source package
[14:32:03] <twb> the AWS and golang people will say "it doesn't matter, just rebuild anytime you notice a problem", but then 1) you have to notice the problem; and 2) you rely on no one in the supply chain saying 'depends foo <= 2.3'
[14:32:44] <twb> Debian has some of this issue as well, but I at least have a pretty clear understanding of who is responsible for what, and what level of guarantee they provide
[14:34:16] <codingquark> With google's own k8s repositories added in sources.list, it seems things can break at anytime
[14:34:34] <twb> If you run on AWS Lambda, then you can say "the app and every library added by the library is 100% the appdev's responsibility, and everything below that is 100% amazon's responsibility", and then you "only" have to worry that the appdev is completely fucking hopeles and won't notice that their #includes ultimately pull in a left-pad library that embeds an SSH server
[14:35:12] <codingquark> I am sure that is a viable plan
[14:35:16] <twb> codingquark: of course if you add third-party apt repos, they are the responsbility of the third party, and often the quality is VERY poor

Or you could just say that infinity doesn't exist and then your problems go away. Until you realise there are infinite primes, infinite

[17:17:22] <taeaad> Facts of life.
[17:18:53] <taeaad> But South African culture is very fragmented. You have the most PC leftist people and the most right wing people at the same time. And the sort of irony is that they are not the source of most violence we have. Most violance is 1) domestic violence 2) violence against other vulnerable groups and 3) crime or poverty based violence / high GINI coefficient. But anyway, I digress.

[17:21:30] <taeaad> The riots for example in the news had little to do with racism.
[17:21:34] <twb> But I'm like "eh I'm not an expert on the region and apartheid and homelands system were maximally shady, so I'll give you the benefit of the doubt"
[17:21:44] <twb> taeaad: and yeah gini coefficient, 100% behind you there
[17:22:05] <taeaad> You just saw mainly black people because we are 80% black and also because a lot of poor people are black. Poor white people also steal, but I think they steal different things.
[17:22:28] <taeaad> So the racism is a catalyst for violence.
[17:22:50] <twb> taeaad: when I say ANC members I don't mean like "a dude stole my car" I mean like the finance minister
[17:23:04] <taeaad> But the violence will remain if you try to only remove racism, which seems impossible anyway. I think the way forward is simply that we need better opportunies for young people.
[17:23:06] <twb> taeaad: but I couldn't give you examples because it was ages ago and I forgot
[17:23:33] <taeaad> twb: The ANC is an elitist government. So the elites can do whatever they want and the ANC doesn't mind.

[17:47:18] <taeaad> twb: I didn't know SVD was a Dragunov.
[17:47:22] <horribleprogram> seems like a good "final jab" when ur about to destroy the villain
[17:47:39] <twb> do you do "data science" in the sense like "here's a database of everyone's age, gender, and panty color as at 1 Jan 2020.  What dyes should we buy most of in the next 20 years?"
[17:48:02] <horribleprogram> that's statistical inference
[17:48:05] <taeaad> hodapp: Anyway, my point about a dog is just that they are intelligent within some bounded context. And we as humans try to find a copy of ourselves, and then something even better. I just think that it's questionable why you would want to do that.
[17:48:29] <hodapp> taeaad: not sure what any of this has to do with AI

[17:49:53] <hodapp> horribleprogram: the question of how to store data for efficient retrieval is... an important area, and one that has a lot more hard science than does data science, but I'm not sure what field that would be
[17:49:54] <twb> AIUI AI is basically "use a database of previous systemic racism, train a neural net to be continue being systemically racist long after we would have said 'I say, that's a bit much'"
[17:50:11] <horribleprogram> taeaad: intelligence and consciousness are two terms that are ill-defined, and always have to be defined everytime we talk about this subject
[17:50:17] <twb> Or, you know, run over cyclists and pedestrians and then blame them
[17:50:30] <hodapp> twb: a lot of pop-culture AI ends up being basically that
[17:50:43] <horribleprogram> hodapp: so ur saying data science focuses more on statistical inferences given a set?
[17:51:22] <hodapp> horribleprogram: they pretend to focus on that sometimes

[17:52:26] <taeaad> I'm not sure where we lost each other, but I was just saying that ML is trained for some sort of prediction, but SVD doesn't necessarily predict, and yet it can. A decision tree is a structure even if you don't use it to make a decision.
[17:52:27] <horribleprogram> I think data science is about making charts in D3.js and showing them in a powerpoint
[17:52:29] <twb> hodapp: I actually know roughly how rudybot is trained
[17:52:57] <twb> hodapp: IIRC it's not a neural net, it's just old-school markov

[19:33:56] <johnjay> Bayes: I've adopted the latter once my .emacs went to like 1000 lines
[19:34:01] <bremner> good practice is to upstream your .emacs so you can have an empty init.el
[19:34:07] <johnjay> Basically I have one init.el which is very minimal and I can share between mac, linux, and windows
[19:34:16] <johnjay> then os specific things go in their own files

[19:36:33] <Bayes> sandman13 did you really think he'd write all those meaty treatises with vim alone ?
[19:36:47] <johnjay> however if you don't have multiple OS machines I think either approach is fine
[19:36:59] <sandman13> I have a weird probem with Emacs and C
[19:37:00] <johnjay> It's just a lot of emacs things assume linux and it's hard to write portable code
[19:37:01] <Bayes> johnjay jetty so where do you put the multiple files? in your .config?
[19:37:14] <johnjay> no in .emacs.d folders like testing, or os
[19:37:31] <Bayes> ok
[19:37:37] <johnjay> I th ink I have a lisp folder too. as a catch all, ~/.emacs.d/lisp
[19:37:51] <Bayes> doesn't it bother you to have .emacs and the .emacs.d folder in your home tho?
[19:38:03] <johnjay> i don't think i have .emacs
[19:38:13] <Bayes> I try to move as many things as possible into ~/.config
[19:38:19] <johnjay> emacs has an order to look for files in, if it doesn't find .emacs it tries init.el and like emacs_d or something on dos
[19:38:23] <sandman13> This is my config for c-mode-common: https://bpa.st/SNQQ
[19:38:34] <Bayes> johnjay neat, I'll dig more into that
[19:38:38] <sandman13> and whenever I try electric-indent with Emacs it indents with 2 spaces :(
[19:38:43] <johnjay> the logic is in startup.el if you want to know the specifics
[19:38:49] <Bayes> so hopefully I can get this more or less organize
[19:38:51] * yeti thinks .config shoild be ~/etc
[19:38:52] <Bayes> organized*
[19:39:06] <johnjay> it's also handy to debug things since you can create .emacs, then have it call whatever code you want to debug it
[19:39:12] <Bayes> yeti ~/.local/etc?
[19:39:27] <johnjay> i.e. you make .emacs. so emacs uses that to overwrite init.el. then you add parts of init.el to .emacs slowly until it breaks

[20:02:25] <bpalmer> it's easiest to not try to do it with regular expressions: search for borg , and then check if // is at the beginning of the line.
[20:03:14] <johnjay> maybe something like [^/]borg? Emacs regexps are non-standard so best way to fiddle with them is to testin scratch uffer
[20:03:58] <johnjay> using e.g. ,,C-s for isearch-forward-regexp
[20:04:00] <fsbot> Try: CopyAndPaste fslisp Iswitchb LineCount
[20:04:04] <bpalmer> but if you had to do it, in this particular case, "^\\(?:borg\\|.borg\\|/[^/].*borg" would do
[20:04:57] <bpalmer> oh, sorry, you want to ignore even things like foo // borg  . My regular expression wouldn't do, in that case, although it could be adapted

[20:10:48] <wasamasa> no, undefined may mean anything
[20:10:56] <oats> I interpret "undefined" to mean, don't do this, but if you do, absolutely don't rely on its behavior
[20:11:09] <johnjay> that's the thing, when you have a semi-consistent behavior people start to rely on it anyway
[20:11:29] <oats> but it could change at any time
[20:11:29] <johnjay> so it might be better to be a jerk about it from the start and randomize the undefined behavior
[20:11:30] <oats> so don't :P
[20:11:34] <bpalmer> Languages like C use undefined to mean that literally anything can happen, because a compiler can make optimizations assuming that all behavior is defined.

[20:24:44] <johnjay> i guess so. the array memory example was intended to be something that's hard to check for
[20:24:45] <tali713> This isn't a thing a person would do on purpose, so you aren't really demonstrating anything by randomizing it, they likely made a typo or don't yet understand that `let' is parallel and `let*' is sequential.  (there may be a better example of when undefined behavior is actually relied on, like a literal closure or some similar)

[20:27:52] <tali713> johnjay: I'm mostly picking on your specific example of `let' because that is an error that newb might make or is an accidental bug.  because for historical reasons the sequential let is considered the variant.
[20:29:50] <tali713> johnjay: do you have another good example of undefined behavior in elisp?  (I know c has more and some of them might actually be relied on)
[20:30:19] <johnjay> no i just randomly came across it reading the manual. which is why i was going to C for the more elaborate one like relying on an array being right after another array
[20:30:54] <johnjay> (actual bug I read about once. an array was randoml changing and it was because it was being overwritten by code handling the array before it in memory)

[22:20:39] <dale> Yeah, I googled and read something about the allocator, on certain platforms, using mmap for allocating memory for buffers.
[22:20:48] <wasamasa> but due to that seeking/decoding nonsense, it doesn't use mmap for files
[22:21:07] <dale> I swear I was once trying to use hexl on a large file and found that no, Emacs wants to put the whole thing into its own private memory.
[22:21:19] <wasamasa> I use r2 for that
[22:21:43] <jetty> there's also nhexl
[22:22:05] <dale> I just don't know how an editor would cope if it did any kind of work with the contents of a file, like recording line offsets, and then the *memory* changed out from under it.
[22:23:56] <jetty> wasamasa: what is r2

[22:24:44] <dale> I'm sure I ended up using one or another of the free, slightly janky hex editors that were purpose-built for large files.

[22:59:37] <johnjay> https://dpaste.com/8FJV3SAU5
[23:01:20] <johnjay> for some reason it duplicates the last entry from the reddit example

[23:05:45] <johnjay> wasamasa: how often do you write a while loop with a premade variable to make sure it only goes 2 or 3 times?
[23:05:58] <johnjay> i feel like this is a valuable thing to do but maybe ti's just because i'm inexperienced
[23:06:06] <wasamasa> not sure what you mean
[23:06:25] <johnjay> in that example I didn't know how match-string worked so i made co = 0 then exited the while loop after co = 3
[23:06:35] <johnjay> that way i could see if it was building the output list correctly
[23:06:54] <johnjay> obviously combined with (print) calls
[23:07:43] <wasamasa> no, I just write something into the scratch buffer and evaluate it
[23:07:48] <wasamasa> why loop
[23:08:37] <johnjay> because i'm writing code to search a string for all occurences of a regexp then concat the result into a list
