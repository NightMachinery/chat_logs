[00:02:09] <pidroid> curl return 6

[00:04:48] <ikke> It looks redundant to me
[00:05:20] <programmerq> pidroid: the docs say that it's supposed to be status code 1 to convey "unhealthy", but I believe docker as it stands considers any non-zero code as unhealthy just as a set of extra guard rails for folks who don't know what non-zero code an arbitrary command may run.
[00:05:37] <programmerq> the docs also say that exit status 2 should not be used because it's reserved for future use.
[00:06:02] <Sven_vB> if I want to run a Dockerfile from a repo, do I have to "git clone", generate a unique name, "docker build", and "docker run" all myself or do we have a shorthand for those steps?
[00:07:02] <pidroid> programmerq ho i didn't see that... thank's ! then i'll keep the || exit 1
[00:07:03] <programmerq> you can 'docker build' using a context/dockerfile with a URL
[00:07:08] <tabakhase> Sven_vB forgot my `echo -e "FROM scratch\nADD http://some.tar /" | docker build -t output -` example from 3h ago already? :P

[00:20:38] <Sven_vB> I'm just disappointed that the default install doesn't ship with such a script, because to me it seems to be a rather common use case.
[00:21:25] <programmerq> not really
[00:21:28] <ikke> It would only cover very simple usecases
[00:21:35] <programmerq> usually you build the image once
[00:21:50] <programmerq> and then you run containers way more frequently than image builds
[00:22:25] <programmerq> additionally, it is extremely common for different people, teams, computers, etc to be involved in the building and running of a given image.
[00:22:32] <programmerq> so the tooling reflects that
[00:23:32] <programmerq> would you want a shortcut for 'wget; tar xzvf; cd ./whatever; ./configure; make; make install; service start foo' and then run that every time you want to start or restart a service? it's just excessive. the build and the run is separated so you don't need to have a fat todo list every time you want to fire up a process.
[00:25:29] <Sven_vB> it has obvious benefits offering build and run separate, and that can coexist with a combined option.
[00:25:47] <programmerq> and as mentioned, compose can combine these steps and really simplify the workflow
[00:26:06] <Sven_vB> indeed I should read about compose more.
[00:27:00] <programmerq> but if you're finding that you need to be constantly running the build, something may not be quite right about your use case and you may just be hitting a beginner type pitfall-- what is it you're trying to accomplish where you feel that build and run should be tightly coupled?
[00:28:11] <Sven_vB> actually, meanwhile I forgot why earlier I thought that's a good idea.

[02:47:27] <dob1> from what I read about best practice is better to run the program in container with  non-root user and that's ok... but which user? for example I use  "RUN useradd -ms /bin/bash worker"  maybe should I set an id < 1000 too so it will not be mapped to a real user when container is running?  
[02:48:13] <dob1> because if it is >= 1000 the process is associated with an existing user and this user can kill the process in container

[03:02:01] <tabakhase> dob1 truth is, you cant know :P
[03:02:35] <dob1> tabakhase, if it's <= 1000 it's a good choice, isn't it?
[03:02:40] <dob1> <
[03:03:17] <tabakhase> 100 is more a "build-dummy" --- ideally, your container can do any (and "i" can use --user to make it what i want anyhow - so my bindmounts work) -- if "any" is not ok, cause you say need a valid $HOME -> https://github.com/boxboat/fixuid  (generally a good readme to read that explains some in&outs)
[03:03:42] <tabakhase> key point, "at build you dont know where and as who for what this will run..."
[03:03:47] <BtbN> Using containers on a system with real users is usually a bad plan no matter what

[03:06:49] <dob1> on the contrary
[03:07:19] <dob1> root is not recommended to run app in container, but it seems more safe, at least is root, the administrator not an user
[03:07:28] <ada_> I wouldn't pick something low because the low uids are associated with system accounts
[03:07:33] <ada_> I would pick an arbitrarily high uid

[03:08:48] <ada_> but really it's not something I worry about very often, because while I wouldn't say it's always a bad plan to use containers on a system with real users, it could be good practice
[03:09:11] <ada_> like, if you've got a system with lots of users, chances are high you're using some kind of mechanism like AD or LDAP or something to manage logins
[03:09:16] <ada_> and you'll have a documented range of users
[03:09:29] <ada_> picking the UID to run a program that's outside the range of users is not really any different
[03:09:55] <ada_> like, the fact that the process runs in a container isn't special - you're still faced with the same problem of "how do I assign a uid that doesn't overlap with my expected uids in my range of possible users"
[03:10:00] <dob1> ada_, but there are containers created by others
[03:10:09] <ada_> and if you've got 10k+ users on your sysstem you already know how to solve this problem
[03:10:16] <ada_> thats why I say pick an arbitrarily high number
[03:10:31] <tabakhase> i guess "ideally" containers be build with there dummy-id to be something "nothing else would ever use" --- just so you dont get stupid stuff show in the hosts `ps` or such ;D  -- so maybe "9999" instead of "1000" as placeholder can make sense ---- BUT, its also most likely when a 1000 exist on the system that 1000 is the user who started it so its not all that wrong 2by accident" :D:D
[03:10:38] <ada_> not 1001, because yeah that's probably your first or second actual user
[03:10:42] <ada_> but like, 20000?
[03:10:44] <ada_> or 50000
[03:11:01] <ada_> but again, if the end-user has a problem with that, they can map the containerized user to some other uid
[03:11:09] <tabakhase> that said, note that a lot these days come with "admin/os/sudo-user" on 1000 and "your user" then gets 1001 or so too :P
[03:11:18] <tabakhase> (so supporting actually setting the user you have todo anyhow)
[03:11:21] <dob1> for example https://hub.docker.com/r/bitnami/redis/  this run as 1001
[03:11:42] <ada_> you have 65535 integers to play with iirc

[03:13:07] <dob1> you mean --user uid option ?   it's not sure it will work as excepted
[03:13:38] <ada_> a good solution to this is to take a UID as an enviroment variable
[03:13:43] <ada_> that way you can let the user pick one at runtime
[03:14:02] <ada_> you might have to do user setup at runtime
[03:14:06] <ada_> but that's a decent tradeoff
[03:14:15] <ada_> maany of the `linuxserver` images do this if yo uwant to see an example
[03:14:36] <tabakhase> idk about bitnami images - but "docker official" images pretty much all should --- and for more "complicated" cases, see the fixuid tool i had linked (but that can also be a few lines of bash and some `sed` commands or so sure)
[03:14:58] <tabakhase> should == should support --user
[03:15:06] <dob1> tabakhase, it doesn't run as root as default the official redis image?

[04:38:21] <CSWookie> Hey, folks.Â  Is there a way to have a Dockerfile ADD only part of a directory structure?Â  I have a large directory structure starting with directory a, and I want to ADD in everything but a/b/c.Â  I don't know anything else about the directory structure except that there is an a/b/c, and that I don't want it in my image.
[04:38:45] <BtbN> Sounds like you want a .dockerignore.

[04:48:35] <karstensrage> docker desktop. for mac downloading updates is slow af
[04:48:52] <queue-> should used rancher
[04:48:56] <queue-> shoulda*
[04:49:09] <karstensrage> whats rancher?
[04:49:13] <queue-> rancher and nerdctl the cmds are no diff lul
[04:49:26] <queue-> actually for mac i think you may want to wait
[04:49:49] <queue-> if you arent on linux/windows i wouldnt touch it
[04:50:13] <queue-> the mac version is buggy, not sure what it is but it can be googled
[04:50:40] <queue-> this is setting u kubernetes basically with rancher desktop (k3s)
[04:50:46] <queue-> up*
[04:53:00] <karstensrage> trying a manual download
[04:54:51] <CSWookie> Hmmm.Â  It has to be in the context, though.Â  I want to put the .dockerignore in the same directory as the Dockerfile, and use someplace else as the context.Â  Is there a way for me to tell docker to look someplace other than the context for the .dockerignore?

[05:07:30] <queue-> you could uninstall docker and alias docker=nerdctl
[05:07:43] <queue-> you wouldnt notice a difference

[12:12:15] <sky_guy> can you please tell me the steps
[12:12:25] <sky_guy> i am a noob :(
[12:12:39] <sky_guy> oh wait

[12:14:13] <sky_guy> so no need for sudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/usb -o uid=pi,gid=pi
[12:14:17] <sky_guy> something like that?
[12:15:02] <atille> I would say it is what you need ;)
[12:15:47] <atille> the volume files will then be in /mnt/usb, so you can point the docker volume to this path to access files from the container, not the block storage directly

[12:16:48] <sky_guy> Mount is denied because the NTFS volume is already exclusively opened.
[12:16:48] <sky_guy> The volume may be already mounted, or another software may use it which

[12:17:45] <atille> Mount -l will show you where is the volume already mounted at, and you can basically change this path by unmouting it and mounting it again manually 
[12:20:22] <sky_guy> it shows /dev/sda1 on /media/Sky's Passport
[12:20:48] <sky_guy> so cna i just use this path -->  /media/Sky's Passport

[12:26:01] <atille> try it ! It the path seems good to you, there isn't that much convention for that. Just keep in mind that the path shouldn't change in the future or the container wouldn't start anymore
[12:26:49] <sky_guy> Oh, I tried with it but still its doesnt work I think :(

[12:29:16] <sky_guy> well, there is no error, its just that the app doesnt show music files in he folder, 
[12:29:26] <sky_guy> so maybe something is wrong in the convention
[12:29:48] <sky_guy> - /media/"Sky's Passport"/:/music:ro
[12:29:54] <sky_guy> this is the line in the docker-compose

[12:30:41] <atille> ok, so few steps to check the reason: open a sh in the container and check if there is files in /music ; verify the applications logs (could say something related to permissions perhaps)

[19:48:20] <iffraff> e.g. you can not stop it from using cached intermediate images. I have tried everything in google and the docs.  Yet when I build it still says CACHED
[19:49:08] <iffraff> people using macs at work are always running into problems with that.  I just thought it was cuz macs sucked, and I told them to use linux.   But now I see that it's cuz mac uses buildkit

[22:59:43] <programmerq> yeah, if a process exits for any reason, the container is considered to be stopped. it could be a bad config, it could be a fatal error, there are lots of reasons tomcat might exit quickly.
[23:00:27] <lantech19446> yea i just ran it without -d and it says failed to start
[23:00:44] <lantech19446> i wonder if it doesn't like the folder i'm trying to bind it too
[23:01:35] <lantech19446> can you tell why it doesn't like this?  docker run -t -v ~/tomcat:/usr/local/tomcat/conf tomcat:8.0
[23:02:18] <ikke> does it have write access there?
[23:02:27] <ikke> it being the process that is running
[23:03:09] <ikke> although, it's just configuration, so it does probably not need write access
[23:04:06] <lantech19446> I'm just trying to put a user config file in ~/tomcat so it gets absorbed when i start the machine I'm still really new to this though so I didn't realize it needed write access within the container to do that
[23:05:01] <lantech19446> like this stuff doesn't get explained in the videos how am I supposed to learn this effectively if people keep skipping important steps like logging in before you can push an image to your repo

[23:36:21] <darkdrgn2k> entry point server creates it in a presistant storage

[23:37:34] <BtbN> It's your responsibility when making the image to ensure it works properly
[23:37:47] <darkdrgn2k> image itself does not contain the pid

[23:38:35] <BtbN> delete the pidfile before starting the binary.
[23:38:42] <BtbN> not exactly "creative", but sure effective
[23:38:48] <darkdrgn2k> yes but how,
[23:38:50] <ikke> provide your own entrypoint 
[23:39:01] <ikke> which then executes the actual entrypoint

[23:39:13] <darkdrgn2k> ikke: that is an option, just dont know if its the best option
[23:39:23] <ikke> darkdrgn2k: command is just provided to the entrypoint
[23:39:23] <BtbN> the image needs to make sure it works properly. Not some external tool using the image
[23:39:25] <darkdrgn2k> but right now is my fall back
[23:39:41] <darkdrgn2k> very fair point..
[23:39:44] <ikke> There is nothing that executes before the entrypoint
