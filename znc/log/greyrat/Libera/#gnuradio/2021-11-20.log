[00:13:05] <Guest36> here is my code
[00:14:41] <geraman21[m]> ninput_items_required is always an int I beleive, since it only tells how many items are you planning to output on the output port
[00:14:56] <Notou[m]> It's strange. It actually looks correct
[00:15:36] <Notou[m]> I looked back at some of my code, and I basically do the same thing you do
[00:16:08] <Guest36> Notou[m] see. what am i missing?

[00:21:31] <Guest36> i have an arr1. I want to copy these values to output_items. How do i do that?
[00:21:50] <Guest36> is
[00:21:51] <Guest36> output_items[0] = arr1
[00:21:51] <Guest36> correct?

[00:23:33] <Notou[m]> Then yes, if arr1 is a numpy array of the right type and length, that's how you do it.
[00:24:41] <Guest36> ok. values are getting copied to output_items[0] correctly. But these values are not getting transferred to next block as input
[00:24:52] <Guest36> input to the next block is always 0.
[00:27:08] *** Joins: bandnyquist (~Rheanna@101.91.232.166)
[00:31:33] <Notou[m]>  Note that if you are looking at the output with something like a QT GUI time sink, it waits to get 1024 samples (parametrable) before showing anything, so if less than that is produced (I might know why) it will just show a blank line. But it doesn't mean that there are samples with the value 0 moving around.
[00:31:33] <Notou[m]> Now, in a basic block, you need to tell the system both how many samples you produced, either with the return value of the work function or by explicitely calling produce(), and also how many you consumed from the input port(s), with consume(port, num_samples). If you don't, the input buffer will fill up may starve the block

[00:34:22] <Guest36> i am not using consume and produce, but i guess i am returning total number of samples consumed and values to be sent to the next block as input.
[00:34:41] <Notou[m]> It may not be the reason, but output_items is a numpy (2D) array, not a python list. So it might not like being given lists as elements.
[00:34:56] <Guest36> yes, i am testing with two ways. using vector sinka and using GUI
[00:35:46] <Notou[m]> Guest36: In the code you pasted, there is a call to consume at the very beginning of the work function, so it's good

[00:50:03] <geraman21[m]> And anybody whom I forgot to mention !
[00:50:48] <Notou[m]> Barry Duggan: If what is you are looking for a way to have a continuous stream of samples and introduce into it PDUs whenever they arrive, I might have something similar, though its <del>probably a bit buggy</del> experimental and it uses tags, that you might use as an example.
[00:51:31] <BarryDuggan[m]> Here is a restatement of my objective: In reference to the https://wiki.gnuradio.org/index.php/Packet_Communications#Using_BPSK_with_Hardware_Simulation_.28version_3.9.29 tutorial, it sends packets but has dead time in-between, which may cause the BPSK receiver to lose sync. I would like to fill the time (and stream) with an idle code so there is always a signal for the receiver. My latest attempt to use a Python Source block didn't
[00:51:31] <BarryDuggan[m]> work out - probably a timing problem or a lack of understanding of the scheduler.
[00:54:49] <Notou[m]> Ok, so it really was what I understood ^^
[00:54:49] <Notou[m]> How were you using the source? 
[00:58:10] <matt_mills[m]> Just want to point out, if you're just transmitting nothing isn't that fairly wasteful of spectrum and unkind to other devices using the same spectrum (assuming ISM band)?

[00:59:44] <matt_mills[m]> the whole point of the pre-amble is to resynchronize the receiver
[00:59:50] <Notou[m]> Yes, but for a tutorial, that may allow for less stuff to understand at one time
[01:00:01] <matt_mills[m]> true
[01:00:04] <BarryDuggan[m]> Notou: look at https://pastebin.com/3LiTrdp2
[01:02:13] <BarryDuggan[m]> FYI, the test packet length is 21
[01:04:32] <BarryDuggan[m]> matt_mills[m]: even the 32 byte preamble is not enough with channel impairments
[01:05:17] <matt_mills[m]> byte or bit? I see 4 bytes in your code
[01:06:31] <BarryDuggan[m]> I'm referring to the tutorial code:
[01:06:31] <BarryDuggan[m]> `char_list = [85,85,85,85,85,85,85,85,85,85,85,85,85,85,85,85,85,85,85,85,85,85,85,85,85,85,85,85,85,85,85,85,225,90,232,147]`
[01:06:36] <matt_mills[m]> ah
[01:07:31] <Notou[m]> Yeah, ok, the issue here is that, as long as the output buffer isn't full, the scheduler will call your source block repededly to get new samples. So in between messages, the idle samples will flood your system. 
[01:07:31] <Notou[m]> You need a way to limit that.
[01:07:31] <Notou[m]> One way I found was to have the block be not a source, but have an input (I guess a sync might work for you) and you can replace the values when you have a message and forward when there is none. That way, you can put something like a constant or null source, followed by a throttle block. And you limit the throttle to your desired speed. That way, in average, your block will treat (copy or place) samples at the speed you want, without being
[01:07:31] <Notou[m]> at the mercy of the scheduler's greed.
[01:09:23] <BarryDuggan[m]> I think I tried a variation of that, but it sounds like the most logical approach. thanks!

[04:48:47] <Guest36> say i am passing 512 input values. So output_items is not changing in size even after giving it size of 25. it remains 512
[04:49:54] <willcode4[m]> The output buffer may be larger than necessary. The nitems you return says how many you filled.

[04:53:01] <Guest36> can you guys please check this code once.
[04:54:24] <Guest36> and i dont know, i am seeing errors if using forecast function.
[04:54:51] <Guest36> it says ninput_items_required is a int and not a list
[04:54:58] <flash[m]> if you are going to call consume, you should also call produce and return WORK_CALLED_PRODUCE. There may be unusual circumstances where that is not true; I'm no expert
[04:57:00] <flash[m]> are you trying to debug your DSP logic, or your integration with gnuradio and the scheduler?
[04:57:44] <Guest36> debug integration with gnuradio and the scheduler
[04:57:57] <Guest36> my logic i have tested, it works fine.
[04:58:34] <Guest36> didnt test in gnuradio though.
[04:58:49] <flash[m]> ok, so in your forecast method, you say "no matter how many output samples you ask for, I need 15 FFT's worth of data" 
[04:58:53] <flash[m]> is that what you mean?
[05:00:13] <Guest36> no no. I have 512 FFT Values 15 times, and i want to produce 25 output values.
[05:01:21] <flash[m]> forecast says "if I want to produce `noutput_items`, how many `ninput_items` are required for each input?"
[05:01:56] <Guest36> in the forecast function logic i wrote is incorrect.¬† i am facing syntax error issue in using forecast function.
[05:02:09] <flash[m]> so you probably want to set_output_multiple to 25
[05:02:23] <Guest36> so to produce 25 output items, i will gicing 7680 values.
[05:02:50] <flash[m]> then forecast should return (noutput_items / 25) * 15 * FFT_size for each input
[05:02:58] <Guest36> no i am not looking for ser_ooutput_multiple. it is different
[05:03:02] <flash[m]> and it may be that the python binding is broken; I haven't used it
[05:03:52] <flash[m]> what would you do if you were called with noutput_items = 3?
[05:04:40] <Guest36> thats fine, 3 values are fine as well.
[05:04:53] <flash[m]> how many inputs would you need?
[05:04:54] <Guest36> wait, no not fine.
[05:05:25] <Guest36> actually there is no proper correlation.
[05:05:57] <Guest36> I would take 15*512 FFT Values. then through my logic bring it down to 25 values.
[05:06:12] <flash[m]> you can control it how you like, but you just have to be able to articulate it
[05:06:22] <Guest36> no matter n*512. I would always output 25 values.
[05:06:30] <Guest36> n<=15
[05:07:22] <flash[m]> you are describing inputs. gnuradio is output driven
[05:07:37] <flash[m]> so you only ever want to produce 25 values?
[05:07:46] <Guest36> true
[05:08:14] <flash[m]> then I suggest you set output multiple to 25
[05:08:51] <flash[m]> then in forecast, set ninput_items_required to noutput / 25 * n * 512
[05:08:59] <flash[m]> (whatever value of n you like)
[05:09:02] <Guest36> but how will gnu radio process 512/25? since 512 is not multiple of 25
[05:09:17] <flash[m]> why is 512 relevant?
[05:09:48] <flash[m]> we are in forecast()
[05:10:15] <flash[m]> noutput_items is the number it wants to produce. If you set the output multiple, it is guaranteed to be a multiple of that
[05:10:22] <Guest36> you said use set_output_multiple
[05:10:57] <flash[m]> right. You want to produce 25 at a time. So "don't call me unless I can produce 25 (or 50 or ...)"
[05:11:30] <flash[m]> when forecast is called, you are then guaranteed that noutput_items is a multiple of 25
[05:12:29] <flash[m]> the purpose of forecast() is to tell the scheduler, "in order for me to produce 25 outputs, I need 15*512 inputs"
[05:17:42] <Guest36> https://imgur.com/a/mArQ0Ou
[05:17:56] <Guest36> flash[m]plese check above image once.
[05:21:31] <flash[m]> what am I looking at, with respect to your block?
[05:21:31] *** Quits: bandnyquist (~Rheanna@218.78.105.67) (Remote host closed the connection)
[05:21:36] <willcode4[m]> Guest36: Why do you want to implement this as a GNU Radio block? You can read the contents of the Vector Sink and then work with the data however you like.
[05:22:39] <Guest36> willcode4[m]¬† thats how i confirmed¬† my logic using vector sink or file sink.
[05:23:14] <willcode4[m]> So implement it that way. Why do you want this to be a block?
[05:24:10] <Guest36> flash[m], so i am running an experiment, if i run it continuously then i should be able to process fft values and produce 25 values. this was acoss 1 ofdm symbol though, 1 ofdm symbol = 15*512 values.
[05:24:32] *** Joins: bandnyquist (~Rheanna@101.89.150.168)
[05:25:03] <Guest36> willcode4[m], if it a continuous real time experiment, then i wont be able to produce 25 averaged across ofdm symbols.
[05:25:28] <Guest36> if its a start and stop approach then yeah vector sink method works.
[05:26:26] <flash[m]> the graph you posted has a single 512  element FFT, not an n*512 FFT. Are we mixing concerns?
[05:26:35] <Guest36> flash[m], l am running with signal source. and in the head block, setting values to 7680.
[05:27:13] <Guest36> flash[m], please give me a minute. realized there is not clarity in the way i am describing.
[05:28:39] <Guest36> If l am running with signal source. and in the head block, setting values to 7680 (15*512). will head give me output only when it has 7680 values? will head wait until it accumulates 7680 values?
[05:28:49] <Guest36> this is my new question with using head block.
[05:30:31] <willcode4[m]> forecast needs to account for the scheduler offering multiples of 25 if you set the output multiple to 25 (which you need to do).
[05:30:32] <flash[m]> https://wiki.gnuradio.org/index.php/Head
[05:32:03] <flash[m]> for ANY block, it is called when the scheduler says it can produce output. Absent any controls, it could be 1 sample or it could be 10000 samples
[05:32:09] <willcode4[m]> While you are using Head (7680) it will only call you once. If the output multiple is 25 and forecast reports that it needs 7680 input items to make 25 output items, you should be all set.
[05:32:24] <Guest36> ok ok. never mind. I cannot use head block anyway in the experiment.
[05:35:41] <Guest36> flash[m], willcode4[m] thank you. I think i got some clarity on scheduler.¬† let me try imlementing it.
[05:36:33] <Guest36> where do i use set_output_multiple? in def __init__?
[05:37:26] <muaddib[m]> <patchvonbraun[m]> "muaddib: They were relatively..." <- I‚Äôve heard the ubiquiti links are good. I‚Äôve only used the small nano stations and i love those, but I heard the 18GHz(maybe 26?) are solid.

[09:18:11] <matt_mills[m]> so you'd also need to setup your pythonpath to find the right gnuradio blocks
[09:18:13] <matt_mills[m]> if you aren't doing that
[09:18:37] <matt_mills[m]> since gnuradio-companion is just a python script that imports gr from gnuradio
[09:19:27] <matt_mills[m]> https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#envvar-PYTHONPATH
[09:19:48] <matt_mills[m]> ie on my machine I use `PYTHONPATH="/usr/local/lib/python3/dist-packages/:/usr/local/lib/python3.8/dist-packages/"`
[09:20:13] <muaddib[m]> what would you suggest as an alternative to support multiple versions? Just having some <grversion>_env.sh files for the pythonpath?
[09:20:29] <muaddib[m]> wait, that wouldnt work would it...
[09:20:43] <matt_mills[m]> you should be able to put them in your same environment files you source for the ld library path

[09:21:21] <matt_mills[m]> if you want to test, you can put it on the command line before the command as well
[09:21:35] <maxtim> hello, how can I get rtl_fm command line tool to sound as good as gqrx?
[09:22:04] <matt_mills[m]> IE, `PYTHONPATH="/home/muaddib/prefix/gr39/lib/python3/dist-packages" gnuradio-companion`
[09:22:39] <muaddib[m]> matt_mills[m]: pybombs environments automatically add the PYTHONPATH when you source them
[09:22:58] <matt_mills[m]> hrm ok then I would think it'd be working correctly then
[09:23:20] <maxtim> I wander, is there a better cli tool for sdr's and fm radio?

[09:24:52] <matt_mills[m]> well I don't know the pybombs way to do it, but I'd clean out the old version by hand and see if it was just a one time issue
[09:25:04] <matt_mills[m]> and rebuild the latest version
[09:25:16] <muaddib[m]> maxtim: hey maxtim, if you're new to GNURadio, you can try the FM demod tutorial. believe it or not, that will generate a commandline tool AUTOMATICALLY, **and** you can have easy access to the internals. 
[09:25:23] <junagarhi[m]> <funkylab[m]> "junagarhi: interesting! Could..." <- I am using python 3.8 gnu radio 3.8.3 ubuntu 20.04

[09:26:05] <maxtim> :)
[09:27:25] <maxtim> muaddib[m], do you have a link?
[09:27:44] <muaddib[m]> matt_mills[m]: so i kinda did that but i'll just do the whole process again. It may have skipped the make uninstall step when i ran rebuild. 
[09:28:08] <matt_mills[m]> it might be uninstalling the wrong version tho
[09:28:19] <matt_mills[m]> you can check the python directories and see whats there after you uninstall
[09:28:25] <maxtim> I'm not exactly new to GNURadio... I've been using it for about a year or so now. But I've never been able to get rtl_fm to sound as good as gqrx or other gui tools
[09:28:51] <patchvonbraun[m]> rtl_fm isn't a Gnu Radio tool.
[09:29:10] <muaddib[m]> matt_mills[m]: i'm gonna try it now
[09:29:17] <maxtim> ah i see
[09:33:06] <muaddib[m]> <maxtim> "muaddib, do you have a link?" <- ok, sorry i may have been mistaken about the wideband FM demod _tutorial_ specifically.... (full message at https://libera.ems.host/_matrix/media/r0/download/libera.chat/f5081583a1063b2f1bdb9b4cd8ec68529db5bf3d)

[11:39:18] <matt_mills[m]> the one showing the 3.9.2 versions
[11:39:26] <matt_mills[m]> those are compiled into that file
[11:40:41] <muaddib[m]> so should i just delete the dist-packages/gnuradio/gr.... or the symlinked files as well?
[11:40:58] <muaddib[m]> maybe i'm not getting it. This part isn't my strongsuit
[11:41:10] <matt_mills[m]> you should be able to delete the entire dist-packages/gnuradio directory if you're re-installing
[11:41:15] <matt_mills[m]> the install will create all the directories

[11:46:11] <matt_mills[m]> You can also grep the install logs to see what exactly is happening with that file
[11:47:21] <muaddib[m]> gotcha. so in theory could just running ```make uninstall && <delete that file> && make install``` , be enough?
[11:47:30] <matt_mills[m]> yes it should

[13:11:01] <muaddib[m]> Yamakaja: said it may be related to a recent update he did. I'll talk to him tomorrow. i think i'm gonna call it a night
[13:11:15] <muaddib[m]> seriously though, thanks for the help!
[13:11:59] <matt_mills[m]> ok
[13:12:50] <matt_mills[m]> ah yeah I see this change https://github.com/gnuradio/gnuradio/commit/956f332e410331fde426e1485589d905cdf80fb1
[13:13:00] <matt_mills[m]> seems related to that code
[13:16:14] <muaddib[m]> yea, i'm not sure what the fix is. i'm running examples from the source tree and a lot of them are having issues as well
[13:17:57] <matt_mills[m]> you could check the grc generated python to see which style it has, just look for wrapinstance()
[13:18:05] <matt_mills[m]> maybe it's not refreshing after the change or something like that
[13:19:15] <muaddib[m]> possibly
[13:20:37] <muaddib[m]> i'm getting a generate error, so i can't actually inspect the code

[13:50:49] <muaddib[m]> yea, i'm sure they're fine. this is just my pybombs env mess i'm sure
[13:50:54] <Yamakaja[m]> Still, the code that it's loading for 3.9 shouldn't return a QWidget object (If that's the latest 3.9 release)
[13:51:47] <Yamakaja[m]> Both of these should exist, and both should return an integer: https://github.com/gnuradio/gnuradio/blob/maint-3.9/gr-qtgui/python/qtgui/bindings/time_sink_c_python.cc#L63-L72

[14:11:53] <muaddib[m]> Just trying to avoid having to start over on 3 pybombs environments
[14:13:33] <drmpeg> Something is cursed on your system.
[14:13:47] <drmpeg> It's a bummer.
[14:14:24] <willcode4[m]> This sounds like old python file in sys dirs. ldconfig should do nothing for user for installs.
[14:15:23] <muaddib[m]> Yea, after 10 years of GNURadio I should be used to making mistakes that cost me my whole install. Not GNURadio just me being careless. Particularly with pybombs.
[14:15:23] <willcode4[m]> Scour /use for any GR stuff.
[14:15:54] <willcode4[m]>  /usr
[14:16:35] <muaddib[m]> willcode4: will do. I‚Äôm not immune to that mistake. 
[14:16:35] <muaddib[m]> If you look back at the discussion between matt_mills and me. Ldd showed everything linking correctly 
[14:17:02] <muaddib[m]> Except there was a dist-packages vs site-packages discrepancy
[14:17:13] <muaddib[m]> Within my pybombs environment
[14:21:05] <willcode4[m]> You would have to check every python wrapper with ldd. `find /usr -name "*gnuradio*"`
[14:23:12] <willcode4[m]> Assuming you already deleted your pybombs prefix or tried a new one.
[14:23:53] <muaddib[m]> willcode4[m]: I can try that
[14:24:02] <muaddib[m]> willcode4[m]: Haven‚Äôt tried a new one 
[14:24:12] <muaddib[m]> Or deleted old one
[14:24:35] <willcode4[m]> Try a new one. That will isolate the problem a bit.
[14:24:39] <muaddib[m]> I‚Äôll try a new one first to see if it‚Äôs sys/pybombs issue
[14:24:52] <muaddib[m]> I‚Äôll try later today

[19:51:14] <drmpeg> You don't really need the thrift dependency. Control port is broken anyway.
[19:53:51] <drmpeg> Control port didn't quite make it through the swig -> pybind11 transition.

[23:00:41] <willcode4[m]> None of that really matters but it says you once had a system install.
[23:01:33] <willcode4[m]> More than one.
[23:04:42] <matt_mills[m]> `find /usr -iname '*gnuradio*.so' | xargs ldd | grep gnuradio` would find all the shared objects and check them out with ldd (you can replace /usr with your prefix path too)
[23:05:37] <matt_mills[m]> then you can add something like `| grep -v '3.8.4'` to reject the version you want and show any other versions
[23:06:07] <matt_mills[m]> for my system I see stuff for 3.8.2 that exists and 3.8.1 that doesn't

[23:48:58] <muaddib[m]> <willcode4[m]> "More than one." <- i'm so careful about that. 
[23:49:13] <muaddib[m]> ok, new gr3.9 prefix works!
[23:49:21] <muaddib[m]> so its just my environments
[23:49:28] <muaddib[m]> which is a relief
[23:49:29] <matt_mills[m]> `/usr/share` is the package install location and `/usr/local/share` would be the cmake default prefix
[23:49:59] <muaddib[m]> yes. however, CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX is set by pybombs to be the defauls
[23:50:12] <muaddib[m]> s/defauls/environment you're in/
[23:51:45] <muaddib[m]> there was some stuff in my i3 configs that makes me think i did some 3.8 stuff in 3.9 or vice-a-versa
[23:59:29] <muaddib[m]> willcode4: matt_mills Yamakaja thank you so much for the support. You got me get back in business. I recently became a contributor to GNURadio for this exact reason. 
[23:59:30] <muaddib[m]> drmpeg patchvonbraun as always thanks for the moral support.
[23:59:57] <muaddib[m]> now i can get to work on my wiki tutorial!
