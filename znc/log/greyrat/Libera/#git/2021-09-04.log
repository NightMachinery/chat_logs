[02:53:30] <Sarvi> I have a very large GIT repository created by uidA:gidA with all its files and git index as uidA:gidA
[02:53:30] <Sarvi> That I have snapshoted/frozen using netapp file system technology aka froze the content of that directory and the git workspace
[02:53:31] <Sarvi> I "filesystem clone" the snapshot for uidB:gidB. which creates a new workspace instantly with an extact replica of the snapshot, with 1 difference every file/directory is now owned by uidB:gidB.
[02:53:31] <Sarvi> When I do a "git status" it forces an update to the index, mostly likely because the files/objects in the index is stored as uidA:gidA, while all the files in the "filesystem cloned" workspace is owned by uidB:gidB and there is a mismatch.
[02:53:32] <Sarvi> Is there a way to efficiently update some or all the objects/files in the index to uidB:gidB. The default update i suspect actually checks each file before updating the index, which in this case is not needed. So I want to way to blindly update all files in the index to uidB:gidB
[02:53:32] <Sarvi> OR
[02:53:33] <Sarvi> avoid forcing the index update.
[02:53:33] <Sarvi> Doing an index update in our very large workspace takes 20+ minutes, on NFS. The workspace is 800GB
[02:55:44] <ZacSharp> Shouldn't 'git status' treat the index as read-only?
[02:56:01] <ZacSharp> and only compare it to the worktree?

[03:02:42] <Sarvi> we ran into a similar issue when we copied this git repo from one file system to annother. git status on the destination workspace also triggered a git index update, this time because the inodes of each of the files are different
[03:03:18] <ZacSharp> Then I don't think you can prevent it without modifying git itself.
[03:03:50] <ZacSharp> And to batch update the index you'd probably need to read and write from and to it yourself
[03:03:57] <Sarvi> i am trying to figure if there is code I can write to modify the uid:gid of all the files in the git-index and how to do that

[03:29:41] <Sarvi> ok. how do I find what is triggering a git-index-update in my scenario, which takes 20+ minuutes
[03:29:57] <thiago> I've been using git for 14 years and have never noticed about the uid in the index
[03:30:00] <thiago> it's not used
[03:31:11] <thiago> any command may require the index to be updated
[03:31:17] <thiago> how many files do you have?
[03:32:27] <Sarvi> bash-4.4$ git ls-files --debug git-edit-index

[03:33:20] <j416> as far as I understand, git uses stat data as a hint to whether files are modified, so diff in stat means interesting file to it

[03:34:10] <thiago> I didn't know it stored the UID and GID. It's useless, since they're not used in the history
[03:34:40] <thiago> is that source code?
[03:35:30] <j416> there's also --cacheinfo to modify the index; just learnt of it now, not sure if useful.
[03:35:34] <j416> man git-update-index
[03:35:34] <gitinfo> the git-update-index manpage is available at https://gitirc.eu/git-update-index.html
[03:36:03] <thiago> anyway, if your hypothesis is right that it's updated because the UID or GID are different, then that's that
[03:36:06] <thiago> git status can update the index
[03:36:40] <j416> yes, letting it run should fix it
[03:37:16] <j416> seems --cacheinfo doesn't change uid/gid, just mode. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[03:37:41] <Sarvi> it does. but it takes about 20 minutes. because it probably has to walk and state each file and update the index
[03:37:47] <ZacSharp> how do you know it updates the index?
[03:37:54] <j416> Sarvi: right, but after that it should be fast?
[03:37:54] <thiago> are the inodes and ctime the same?
[03:38:04] <Sarvi> git status command says so
[03:38:10] <Sarvi> updating Index
[03:38:17] <thiago> what kind of system updates UID but not inode or ctime?
[03:38:52] <j416> also I'd try to avoid using a repo mounted over the network, if possible
[03:39:00] <j416> obvious perhaps, but just in case.
[03:39:06] <Sarvi> git status taking 20 minutes defeats the purpose of what we are trying to do
[03:39:07] <j416> s/just/mentioning just/
[03:39:14] <ZacSharp> so you are sure it does not spend the 20 minutes scanning the worktree for changes?
[03:39:33] <j416> Sarvi: did you let it run to completion once?
[03:39:39] <Sarvi> we want to offer prebuilt workspace git source tree + prebuilt workspace so developers can do incremental builds
[03:39:59] <thiago> so warm up the index before offering the space to the user
[03:40:10] <Sarvi> for this we do regular builds in a GIT workspace and snapshot the resulting workspace.
[03:40:20] <Sarvi> That snapshot is 900GB
[03:40:27] <thiago> anyway, Git is not designed for your usecase
[03:41:38] <Sarvi> the clone that gets created from that snapshot is exactly the same, except the netapp file system takes care of changing all files/directories to the developer's uid:gid at workspace clonig time which takes 30 seconds for the 900
[03:41:44] <Sarvi> GB workspace clone
[03:42:05] <thiago> what's a "netapp file system" ?
[03:42:09] <Sarvi> so if i have to a git status that takes 20 minutes, it defeats the purpose
[03:42:20] <j416> this is a loopy monologue; I'm out. gl
[03:42:27] <Sarvi> Netapp has NFS file system capability
[03:42:40] <thiago> Git is not designed for networking filesystems
[03:42:46] <thiago> in fact, they're counter-indicated
[03:42:49] <Sarvi> that is capable of these volume snapshoting ad cloning that we are using
[03:43:07] <thiago> *any* change in the file is meant to cause Git to scan again to see if the file has changed
[03:43:24] <Sarvi> thats fine by me.
[03:43:59] <thiago> modifying the file's metadata without modifying the ctime is a big break in Unix semantics
[03:44:04] <thiago> your filesystem should update the ctime
[03:44:05] <Sarvi> I am just trying the most simplest approach to changing the uid/gid of all the entries in the git-index, even if I have to write a little bit of code
[03:44:14] <thiago> anyway, you'll need to update the index
[03:44:30] <thiago> you can write the application to do the UID/GID change

[17:36:23] <osse> the best ypu
[17:36:31] <osse> the best you're gonna get is stash; pull; stash pop
[17:36:40] <osse> and then resolve the conflicts yourself
[17:36:42] <Ballerburg9005> the thing is this: I have put a server config on github. Now when you first setup the server, you pull tons of files that then later get modified by the server owner. Now you could still pull all the updated files from git, but in order to do that people have to be able to ignore the local conflicts by keeping their versions.

[22:01:05] <thebombzen> since that's the only thing that would cause ssh to behave differently than the rest of dns
[22:01:08] <lantech19446> ok that makes more sense I've been trying to do it wrong the whole time
[22:01:33] <thebombzen> github is fairly picky, you have to do git@github.com:owner-name/repo.git with no extra / and you do need .git
[22:01:43] <thebombzen> if you add extra / or remove the .git it will fail
[22:02:07] <thebombzen> optionally prefix with ssh:// but I think it will figure that part out on its own
[22:02:41] <lantech19446> is there a way to remove the remote origin I already set?
[22:03:03] <thebombzen> git remote remove, though you probably want git remote set-url
[22:03:27] <lantech19446> ok I'll try that first, it's just telling me the remote origin already exists because i set it up for https

[22:05:30] <lantech19446> i added the other origin successfully but it's still using the https one

[22:09:45] <lantech19446> so it kept telling me the id_rsa was an invalid format so i used git bash to do the keygen and it worked the first time

[22:44:56] <perrierjouet> hi all
[22:45:19] <perrierjouet> when I wanted to install a git submodule I got fatal: not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git
[22:45:32] <perrierjouet> I did git submodule add https://github.com/halogenica/beautifulhugo.git beautifulhugo
