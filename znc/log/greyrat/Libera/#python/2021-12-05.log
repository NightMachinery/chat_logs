[00:00:30] <aphysically> you can always split things up anyway
[00:00:32] <SnoopJ> skeemer, it is not uncommon to write an intermediate layer like this: `def middle_layer(middle, layer, params, *args, **kwargs): do_something(middle, layer, params); lower_layer(*args, **kwargs);;`
[00:00:34] <jinsun> also too many things are not expressions and have to be wrapped up inside functions
[00:01:53] <SnoopJ> skeemer, i.e. declare what parameters a function *does* care about in its signature, swallow the rest in *args, **kwargs, then pass them along as needed.

[14:32:50] <aniketgm> bookworm: I used to... like way back 5-6 years i guess...
[14:33:26] <bookworm> a tuple is essentially an array, a fixed length one. While the list is a dynamically re-sizable implementation of the same

[14:35:15] <bookworm> glossing over lots of the details, but that's essentially the gist of it. So using a list would always be more wasteful than a tuple, storage wise and performance wise in the really hot code paths
[14:35:33] <aniketgm> bookworm: yeah, I know. but do we really need a new type, just to make it immutable.

[14:39:16] <aniketgm> bookworm: KirkMcDonald: the arguments are justifiable. but still not convinced as to why go over the hasle of maintaining a complete new type for immutability. maybe a look into the source code would give me an insight.
[14:41:26] <KirkMcDonald> I mean, your suggestion implies bifurcating the behavior of many of the list type's methods.
[14:41:56] <aniketgm> bookworm: there would be diff. tuple(list) would be a tuple type. however  immut(list) still stays a list just not mutable anymore,
[14:42:00] <KirkMcDonald> Which strikes me as a more involved solution than just having this other thing be its own type.
[14:43:12] <KirkMcDonald> It makes the answer to the question "Can I call .append on this list?" be "It depends."
[14:43:17] <aniketgm> KirkMcDonald: essentially yes.
[14:44:01] <KirkMcDonald> This seems worse.
[14:45:15] <KirkMcDonald> Like... you're talking about having two kinds of objects, which behave in significantly different ways. Which is basically what a type is.
[14:48:06] <aniketgm> well somewhat. but more like only one kinds of objects, which behaves differently, with respect to access to it's elements.
[14:48:23] <aniketgm> and write.
[14:48:46] <KirkMcDonald> Some of the differences are subtle. Consider the += operator.

[15:03:56] <bjs> aniketgm: historically a tuple has been like a "structure",  somewhat like a class. So is not really supposed to be similar to a list.

[15:05:02] <bjs> Python kind of muddies the waters here by using tuples in odd places, and by adding some sequence operations to tuple.
[15:05:59] *** Joins: Ashburry (~Ashburry@184.69.89.188)
[15:06:19] <bjs> Today I think most "structure" needs are fulfilled by classes and sequence needs by lists, so tuples live in this niche area of "i have a structure but don't want to write a class for ${whatever reason}"
[15:08:48] <Ashburry> tuples are just low-end lists; they are not overburdened with features. On top of that they are concrete.
[15:08:51] <bjs> By any accounts I wouldn't call tuple a "new type", it's probably the oldest type (both practically in Python and also historically mathematicians have had tuple types for hundreds of years)
[15:09:08] <bjs> Ashburry: "are concrete" what does that mean? and I've just been arguing why no they're not really "just lists"

[15:10:46] <bjs> Ashburry: what operation on a tuple gives you a new tuple

[15:16:03] <nedbat> Ashburry: i've never heard "concrete" to mean immutable before.
