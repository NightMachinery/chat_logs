[01:20:58] <BadAdviceCat> relipse, I've noticed it's much better to be explicit and type hint stuff because it then motivates the person who wants to use the function to ensure their inputs are actually clean, using the right type of inputs. Doing necessary input validation before that function is used.
[01:24:59] <BadAdviceCat> For example, looking at divBox(string $textMessage, bool $withFancyBorders) {}  <-- Tells people that their input better be clean. For instance, the bool can not be "yes", "no", 0, 1, or some other number higher than 0. It must be boolean true or boolean false, or the function will fail.
[01:25:14] *** Quits: DrowningElysium (uid190788@user/drowningelysium) (Quit: Connection closed for inactivity)
[01:26:12] <BadAdviceCat> The function would be rather dirty if we had to filter the $withFancyBorders to coerce the value into a boolean. So that we can allow "yes/no" and 0 or a number higher than 0.

[13:43:07] <DevAntoine> Hello
[13:43:08] <DevAntoine> So, let's say we've got a Pro having multiple documents for doing its job (like certifications, diplomas and stuff). Someone else has to make sure all the Pro's documents are valid. I want to introduce a boolean variable stating that all the Pro's documents have been verified/checked/asserted by that other personn. What should I use? "verifiedDocuments" / "checkedDocuments" / "hasDocumentsBeenChecked".

[13:45:15] <DevAntoine> AllenJB: well, I'm not sure about the right word because english ain't my first language
[13:45:42] <DevAntoine> I'm reviewing a PR and currently the boolean is "verifiedDocuments" but that makes little sense to me
[13:46:07] <biberu> if it's a business term perhaps it shouldn't be forcibly translated?
[13:46:52] <AllenJB> Why does it make little sense to you? Without any additional context / knowledge of the domain, all of the options you gave seem equivalent to me.

[13:52:11] <DevAntoine> but using french in code seems like a bad idea

[14:13:39] <biberu> code and technical terms yes, but business terms can be hard to translate in complex domains
[14:16:24] <AllenJB> If your business operates in french, all your coders speak fluent french, why should your class, function, variable and field names be in english? Names should be as concise as possible, and translation frequently loses something.

[14:16:46] <da_wunder> you really don't want to use non-english terms

[17:53:19] *** Quits: tercaL (~tercaL@user/tercal) (Quit: enter the Tekken!)
[18:06:09] <AllenJB> Not sure what you mean. A basic method might be: $success = (random_int(1, 100) <= $percentChangeToSucceed);
[18:06:24] <AllenJB> But that's making a number of assumptions about your game logic
[18:07:16] <chazy> it should be a simple result of yes or no, i can't think of any condition other than the success percentage
[18:07:22] <AllenJB> You might want to look at resources specific to game design, or existing board or table-top / pen & paper games for examples / inspiration
[18:08:04] <biberu> i don't understand the question
[18:09:38] <chazy> biberu: if a character has a 50% chance of scoring a goal, how do i know if it succeds or fails?
[18:11:01] <biberu> so you just want a random coin flip? a 0 or a 1?
[18:20:39] <chazy> yes, that's the idea

[19:29:45] <Jonos> if this info helps at all
[19:30:42] <AllenJB> The code you've got here has a lot of problems (the code is very insecure and uses lots of bad practices, especially by modern standards). I would avoid whereever you found that guide in the future.

[19:33:32] *** Quits: vel (~vel@ec2-52-62-28-79.ap-southeast-2.compute.amazonaws.com) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[19:35:38] <Jonos> Does anyone have a uptodate guide for php and making registration forms, been a few years since using php a little rusty need some guidance for now
[19:35:55] <Jonos> Thanks everyone for your input :)
[19:36:15] <__adrian> first thing to unnderstand is that the php code and the form are completely separate things.
[19:36:28] <__adrian> for your php script, you only decide what inputs your php script needs.
[19:36:44] <__adrian> it doesn't matter what your form looks like, or if you even use a form.
[19:36:57] <__adrian> that's for later, once your php is done.
[19:37:35] <__adrian> so, i'd assume you need at least an "email" and a "password". anything else?
[19:37:49] <Jonos> email password first name last name username profile image.
[19:38:19] <Jonos> and confirm to terms but this is html(not php)
[19:38:39] <__adrian> "this is html (not php)" // how so?
[19:39:05] <Jonos> oh yeah i would need to use php to submit the confirmation.
[19:40:09] <__adrian> php would verify that "agree" was marked true/yes
[19:40:40] *** Joins: vel (~vel@ec2-52-62-28-79.ap-southeast-2.compute.amazonaws.com)
[19:41:12] <__adrian> so the next thing is to validate all your inputs. e.g., that the email looks like an email and hasn't already been used to sign up, that the password is at least 12 characters long, that the names are not empty, etc.
[19:41:26] *** Joins: luigibu (~luigibu@11.red-79-159-71.dynamicip.rima-tde.net)
[19:41:36] <__adrian> whatever your logic needs
[19:42:13] <__adrian> once all that is validated, look at the file upload.
[19:42:30] <__adrian> as mentioned above, DO NOT let the user pick filenames on your server. NOT EVER.
[19:42:53] <__adrian> you pick your own uploaded file locations and filenames. ALWAYS.
[19:43:23] <__adrian> IF you want to keep the info the user gave you (e.g., their chosen filename), you store that in the database.
[19:43:23] <Jonos> allowing custom avatar image uploads how would i control the submitted names then ?
[19:43:48] <__adrian> you don't "control" the names. you _pick the names yourself_.
[19:44:00] <__adrian> you MUST NEVER ALLOW a user to choose filenames on your server.
[19:44:12] <Jonos> so for e.g upload1 upload2 and submit to database original filename input by user?
[19:44:37] <__adrian> if you _want_ the original filename, sure. i don't really see why, in this case, you'd care.
[19:45:14] <Jonos> i need the original filenames due to the nature of web and game design member of this project will need to upload there own assests and such.
[19:45:18] <__adrian> i'd just do something like  images/$user_id/avatar.png
[19:46:04] <__adrian> but if you want to keep the original names, yes, you'd put them in the DB.
[19:46:44] <__adrian> let me hit some high-level problems here, before we move on
[19:46:50] <__adrian> in no particular order:
[19:46:57] <Jonos> ..
[19:47:45] <__adrian> 1) do not use extract(). this creates a lot of invisible $variable, which could collide (overwrite) variables in your script. collect your inputs explicitly, by name. it's ok to leave them in $_POST until you're ready to use.
[19:48:28] <__adrian> 2)( DO NOT put $variables in your SQL. this is an injection vulnerability. if you're running code like this now, then stop _now_, and go delete it.
[19:48:52] <__adrian> when you put data into your DB, you should ALWAYS use parameters. !+pdo_mysql prepare
[19:48:52] <php-bot> when you put data into your DB, you should ALWAYS use parameters., How to prepare a statement using PDO: https://gist.github.com/adrian-enspired/1ddd71511e01c1f609db
[19:49:35] <__adrian> if you want to keep using mysqli, it does support parameters also:  https://php.net/mysqli.quickstart.prepared-statements
[19:50:11] <__adrian> ...but if this is a new project, or you're just learning, i will highly recommend PDO. it's easier to use and learn, harder to make mistakes, and you'll find MANY more people willing to help you.
[19:51:37] <__adrian> 3) don't SELECT *. this is wasteful and error-prone. SELECT the,specific,columns,you,need (even if you need "all columns"). in this case, you don't need any columns - it's a yes/no question.  SELECT 1 FROM register WHERE Email = ?
[19:52:03] *** Quits: esselfe (~steph@user/esselfe) (Quit: brb)
[19:52:26] <__adrian> 4) do not use die() as error handling. this is not what it's for. throw an exception instead.
[19:52:33] *** Joins: esselfe (~steph@user/esselfe)
[19:53:03] <__adrian> if (mysqli_num_rows($sql) > 0) { throw new Exception("Email ID is already registered."); }
[19:53:17] <Jonos> i have that line in a different file.
[19:53:34] <Jonos> but i did not throw the exception.
[19:53:37] <Jonos> i see your point.
[19:53:45] <__adrian> 5) else(isset($_POST['save']));  // this is probably not what you meant to write (the semicolon)
[19:53:55] <Jonos> oops
[19:53:58] <Jonos> - ;
[19:54:11] <Jonos> im always doing that in php.
[19:54:30] <Jonos> adding colon when not needed i normally pick it up onvalidation
[19:54:43] <__adrian> related: there's an idea in programming called "fail early"
[19:55:03] <Jonos> yeah php was version 4.someting when i used it last
[19:55:09] <Jonos> taling 6-7 years ago

[19:56:59] <Jonos> yeah the 2 semicolons in that script terminate it before its ran.
[19:57:24] <Jonos> it dont need any on that as far as i know
[19:57:48] <__adrian> 6) the place to use die() is when you want to be sure your script stops: for example, after you redirect.  header("Location: https://..."); die();
[19:58:45] <__adrian> 7) DO NOT EVER use md5() for password hashes. NOT EVER.
[19:58:55] <__adrian> always use https://php.net/password
[19:59:44] <__adrian> welcome.
[20:00:13] <__adrian> i'd recommend starting a new script fresh, and considering each of these points one at a time.

[20:27:22] <mas886> Hey there, I have a question about dates, and when I seach about it in the internet a thousand of ways of doing it appears, but they all look kind of messy to me. What would it be the best and cleanest way to save the current date/timestamp on a variable, and then comparing it to another date/timestamp variable and get the numeric difference
[20:27:23] <mas886> between the both in days? I don't even need the date viariables to be readable, i just need them to compare one to the other
[20:29:46] <AllenJB> I would recommend using DateTime(Immutable) objects: https://www.php.net/DateTime. Use ::createFromFormat() to parse date strings in a known format. Use ->diff() to get the difference.
[20:34:33] <mas886> Hm, but using an object for such a simple task seems overkill
[20:42:16] <AllenJB> DateTime simplifies dealing with timezones (you can compare 2 objects with different timezones), and allows direct comparison using < and >. You can also use DateTimeImmutable to ensure values don't accidentally change.
[20:42:16] <AllenJB>  ::createFromFormat ensures that if a date isn't in an expected format, you know about it (rather than strtotime() which will try to parse it anyway and quite possibly get it wrong).
[20:43:08] <AllenJB> (And because the format is specified, ::createFromFormat can handle a far greater range of formats than strtotime()).
[20:43:17] *** Joins: NakedKing (~NakedKing@user/nakedking)
[20:44:46] <mas886> AllenJB: Thank you very much! But I think I found what I needed with the function "timestamp()", that offers me something more basic and easy to store, no need to look for timezones and such
[20:45:07] <mas886> time() function not timestamp()
[20:45:44] <Naktibalda> you wanted the cleanest and the best, not the quickest
[20:46:23] <AllenJB> If you're comparing with a value from somewhere else, you probably do want to be aware of timezones. Getting things like "number of days" from timestamps / seconds also gets Fun around DST changes.
[20:46:55] * AllenJB is always confused when people ask for a recommendation, then go "err, no, maybe I'll do it another way"

[21:23:46] <jackal> hello, im big amateur to php, can you assist me on the following issue
[21:25:54] <jackal> i have file upload form and max_file_uploads = 20, is there a way to check how many files user has selected for uploading before submitting?
[21:25:56] <da_wunder> don't ask to ask - just ask - maybe someone can help you
[21:27:16] <da_wunder> for that you need some javascript
[21:27:36] <da_wunder> because you need to check those _before_ you're actually submitting that form
[21:28:32] <jackal> meh
[21:28:37] <jackal> i was hoping on php
[21:29:21] <jackal> issue is not every browser reacts the same on maximum allowable file uploads exceeded warning
[21:30:33] *** Quits: mas886 (~mas886@5.159.138.255) (Quit: Connection closed)
[21:32:26] <da_wunder> then just write some javascript and disable form submit if/when your limit is full

[22:55:03] <judah> I wish I knew more about how other languages implemented their class system
[22:56:12] <judah> I have heard some people say that classes are slower. I suppose there is a case for that, but in theory you are just swapping a pointer to a lambda to a pointer to a pointer to a lambda. Minimal overhead involved.
[22:56:37] <judah> Though thats just how I would build it, I dont actually have any real experience with language design

[23:15:48] <relipse> no one is answering me in #mysql, why would several mariadb tables crash?
[23:16:24] <sbrothy> i didnt know tables could crash..
[23:16:50] <sbrothy> whats the symptoms? not that im an expert it just sounds... interesting
[23:17:40] <sbrothy> not many ppl working these days i guess
[23:17:48] <TinoDidriksen> What kind of tables? MyISAM tables aren't ACID, but InnoDB is and is very hard to corrupt. In any case, restore from backup if recovery doesn't work.
[23:21:12] <sbrothy> ah data corruption

[23:37:58] <AllenJB> MySQL (and MariaDB) mark tables as crashed if they think they are not / might not be in a sane state. This is usually due to an event such as sudden power loss or hardware issues. I would investigate why the tables were marked as crashed (what happened just before that / last time the machine shut down or are there any alerts in system / kernel
[23:37:59] <AllenJB> logs about bigger problems)
[23:39:52] *** Joins: The_Blode (~Blode@user/the-blode/x-7164444)
[23:41:02] <judah> Out of curiosity, what would the recovery process of InnoDB tables look like? I dont know much about how it works under the hood, but its hard to imagine that the whole file is corrupted by an unexpected power loss
[23:45:04] <relipse> apparently there was a huge load spike and then mariadb restarted, and a bunch of tables were marked as crashed, one of which could not be repaired and we had to fix by importing a backup
[23:45:46] <relipse> but why would a load spike cause mariadb to restart and why would that mark a bunch of tables as crashed?
[23:46:44] <relipse> thanks AllenJB
[23:46:44] <AllenJB> relipse: When the load spike occurred, did mariadb get killed by OOM-Killer (kernel Out Of Memory Killer - you will see an entry in the kernel log if this is the case)?
[23:47:02] <judah> The mystery deepens
[23:48:33] <TinoDidriksen> What kind of tables? MyISAM or InnoDB or whatever?
[23:49:12] <AllenJB> It's probably not a very deep mystery - the cause is usually obvious once you actually investigate
[23:50:10] <AllenJB> On linux, by default, if the system is trying to use more memory than is available, the kernel will start killing things (I assume based on a set of rules). Frequently that will be something memory-hungry like MariaDB / MySQL.

[23:50:35] <da_wunder> every database is memory hungry
[23:50:41] <AllenJB> This is one reason it's a good idea to run MariaDB / MySQL on its own instance where it's much easier to configure memory usage settings so this doesn't happen
[23:50:53] <da_wunder> ^
[23:51:07] <da_wunder> and that goes for every another database
[23:52:31] <relipse> These are MyISAM
[23:52:35] <da_wunder> and for myisam vs innodb - I would prefer innodb because then you've real foreign keys - also with innodb you only get row locks and within myisam you got table locks
[23:52:49] <TinoDidriksen> Well there's your problem. Use InnoDB.

[23:53:24] <TinoDidriksen> MyISAM is not ACID-compliant.
[23:53:39] <da_wunder> ^
[23:55:17] <da_wunder> innodb has also transactional logs, so you can recreate your db per every transaction while with myisam you need to recover whole table(s) with single process
