[00:58:09] <two2thehead> Mildly interesting
[00:58:19] <kuudes> I mean, I would just grant the residence when such happens
[00:58:44] <kuudes> seems rather easy to check if a child is in a feeding tube or not
[00:59:09] <kuudes> maybe some of them fake it - so what
[00:59:33] <kuudes> or, if you want to deport them, deport them while their child is comatose
[00:59:54] <kuudes> at least there should not be such a state that their permit to stay is contingent on their kid being in coma
[01:00:31] <two2thehead> TIL "harlequin tights"
[01:00:43] <two2thehead> Basically tights with a checkerboard pattern
[01:00:52] <gwern> I'm not saying they fake it, although that is certainly not out of the question. but if you're looking for answers like "what if swedish is so deeply racist it's traumatizing these children into comas", it's going to be a very long time until you reach "oh, it's an autoimmune response to encephalitis they all contracted back in some disease-ridden third world country"
[01:01:07] <kuudes> yeah, I agree
[01:01:30] <gwern> not to mention poisoning public discourse by inventing imaginary invisible sins
[01:01:31] <kuudes> but iirc it was so that those kids bad health is the reason they are allowed to stay
[01:01:38] <kuudes> which means incentives are already perverted
[01:02:00] <kuudes> ie if the kids got better, they would be deported
[01:02:04] <gwern> sure, but there do seem like there are a lot of easier ways to defraud the system
[01:02:09] <kuudes> indeed
[01:02:34] <gwern> "I'm going to invent some sort of sleeping disease no one has ever heard of! this is a brilliant idea which will definitely work"
[01:02:37] <kuudes> but I would be at least removing the weird incentives from the families at question, and hopefully then enable treatment and recovery better
[01:03:29] <two2thehead> gwern, where did you hear the term infection backlash? My google-fu is bad today
[01:03:37] <gwern> just a phrase
[01:03:42] <gwern> I'm sure it has a fancier name
[01:03:49] <kuudes> but yeah, autoimmune condition would hold a high prior for me as well
[01:03:50] <two2thehead> ah
[01:05:07] <gwern> sleep is weird because it's controlled by a very small group of neurons, so even a bit of damage can cause really specific changes
[01:05:13] <two2thehead> if you are taking suggestions I recommend calling it 'post-infection backlash'. Google only brings up antivaxx and antilockdown stories when I google the other term
[01:05:55] <two2thehead> "After a few years, apathy was converted to an official medical designation—Uppgivenhetssyndrom—literally meaning “to give up.” In English, this became “resignation syndrome.”"

[01:09:34] <two2thehead> "Not all the medical interest in this disorder has focused on blood tests and brain scans. More psychologically minded explanations have compared resignation syndrome to pervasive refusal syndrome (also called pervasive arousal withdrawal syndrome—PAWS), a psychiatric disorder of children and teens in which they resolutely refuse to eat, talk, walk, or engage with their surroundings. The cause is unknown, but PAWS has been linked to stress an
[01:09:34] <two2thehead> d trauma. The withdrawal in PAWS is an active one, as the word “refusal” suggests; it is not apathetic. Still, as a condition associated with hopelessness, it does seem to have more in common with resignation syndrome than other suggestions."

[03:12:39] <gwern> wtf i love banana berries now

[03:13:39] <feepbot> What fruit is growing on my potato plants? - MSU Extension (Gardeners have been surprised this year to find fruit produced on tops of potato plants. Learn how they are caused and why they are not edible.)
[03:13:40] <Obormot\Arcturus> "So marvel at the fruit of your potatoes – this is not going to be a yearly event. It is not an evil omen or bad luck. Your potatoes below the soil will be just fine. Just blame it on the weather."
[03:13:50] <saturn2> botanically the entire plant (including the fruit) is a vegetable
[03:14:44] <Obormot\Arcturus> "If you saved the ripe seeds inside the potato fruit, you would not get the same kind of potatoes as the parent plant. It would take several years to even grow these to a size that you could harvest. The only people saving and planting potato seeds are growers and breeders who are hoping to produce a new variety of potato."
[03:14:53] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Each fruit contains 300-500 seeds that don’t come true: planting them doesn’t result in the same potatoes as the parent plant, there’s lots of genetic variation. Potato breeders plant out thousands of seeds, check out the results, then keep replanting the most desirable potatoes for many years or so to get new commercial varieties—apparently, this is the way new potatoes are bred."
[03:15:45] <gwern> like apples
[03:16:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Humans have selected potatoes for heavy yields of large tubers.  In contrast, wild potatoes often produce a much greater yield of berries than tubers.  Through those thousands of years of selection, we probably didn’t care much about berries, since we don’t eat them or use them to propagate the plants in most cases.  As a consequence, domesticated potatoes have often “forgotten” how to reproduce sexually.  Many
[03:16:12] <Obormot\Arcturus>  varieties rarely or never flower even in ideal conditions.  Some flower but fail to hold their berries.  Something like 10% of modern potato varieties are reliable flowerers."

[03:19:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> "If granted the opportunity, NUs would e.g. initiate a vacuum phase transition, program seed AI with a NU utility function, and do anything humanly possible to bring life and suffering to an end."
[03:20:19] <Obormot\Arcturus> (This is a self-description; the guy who wrote that comment identifies himself as a negative utilitarian)
[03:22:03] <kuudes> yes, which is why they must never be allowed into such position.
[03:23:34] <kuudes> "Secular Buddhists like NUs" are indeed dangerous
[03:23:36] <Obormot\Arcturus> (The remainder of this thread hashes out a position which boils down to "if we can totally eliminate suffering from the universe, then yeah, life and people and so on can stay, but if there's any suffering, ANY suffering at all - then it's the big ol' OFF switch for existence")
[03:24:19] <pompolic> Obormot\Arcturus: (metaphorical extensions) interesting post, thanks. I'm trying to think of other examples, because i know i use this construction
[03:24:42] <pompolic> sort of like adjective+noun except using another noun as adjective
[03:25:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Note that the OP is not me, the link was to a comment)
[03:26:15] <pompolic> oh yeah, i was referring to your comment, my bad
[03:27:11] <pompolic> reinterpreting nouns as adjectives feels natural because my native language actually has suffixes to that end
[03:27:16] <pompolic> literal typecasting lol
[03:28:24] <pompolic> but taking the "river of ice" example, you could just put ice+river together in a compound word without any suffixes and people would probably guess the meaning right
[03:30:16] <gwern> I've seen people talk about 'ice river' in the context of glaciers etc
[03:30:28] <gwern> ice is plastic enough to flow, I think

[06:39:51] <ggreer> my uncle (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:CCMS_Stanley_C._Cadell.jpg) is retiring from the air force after 30 years of service. his retirement ceremony is on friday at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Museum_of_the_United_States_Air_Force

[06:40:10] <ggreer> first the ceremony was changed to not have a dinner due to covid restrictions. and until about an hour ago, it wasn't clear if it could happen at all because if the government shut down, the museum would be closed
[06:40:23] <ggreer> I think he'll be happier in the private sector
[06:40:44] <gwern> ah, but if the government shuts down, then y'all can just get all your machine guns together and shoot'em off
[06:40:53] <gwern> much better than some lame commercial-food catered dinner
[06:41:02] <ggreer> heh
[06:41:13] <gwern> there's laws against that, but when the government shuts down, there's no laws. that's just logic.
[06:41:24] <ggreer> the fallback plan was to have the ceremony in a general's back yard at the adjacent air force base

[22:04:55] <feepbot> transcript revealed that the smoking-gun quote did not really exist. The filmmakers had re-ordered his words and removed other sentences in between, splicing together what had potentially been two disparate thoughts. Amid twenty rambling sentences on a hot mic, Durst may have made some kind of confession, but it was certainly not nearly as clear as the show had made it seem.
[22:05:01] <feepbot> Critics viewed this as a grave transgression, and journalists saw an engineered quote meant to gin up drama and deceive viewers. (The New York Times headline read, “As Durst Murder Case Goes Forward, HBO’s Film Will Also Be on Trial.”) For filmmakers, radical audio edits like this one are routine, even though the ramifications for their subjects tend to be less severe.'
