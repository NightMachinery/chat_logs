[00:00:42] <SamuelMarks> fizzie - So can I copy that entire buffer to a local `char*` for later direct `free`ing?
[00:01:17] <SamuelMarks> copy or move that is to say
[00:01:56] <SamuelMarks> iff it's first 20 bytes matches my specific pre-declared 20 byte `const char*` that is to say
[00:02:35] *** Joins: duds- (~duds-@user/duds)
[00:03:06] <fizzie> Well, I mean, the fundamental point I was getting at is, using the return value of `read` to decide how much memory to allocate inherently means you must have read it somewhere *else* first. So if you want the data to end up in the newly allocated chunk, a copy of the actual bytes must be involved.
[00:03:38] <SamuelMarks> kk
[00:04:21] <SamuelMarks> So how do I copy then, do I always need to provide the size or if the buffer exists somewhere and isn't hidden completely behind implementation details, can I just copy that whole buffer directly?
[00:04:51] <ChoHag> If you want to copy data you need to know how big it is or how its end is marked.
[00:04:59] <ChoHag> There is no just.
[00:05:18] <SamuelMarks> So the socket internal buffer doesn't know how big it is?
[00:05:28] <fizzie> The buffer in this question would be whatever pointer you passed to `read`.
[00:05:54] <SamuelMarks> hmm so there's no internal buffer it's just what I give it
[00:05:59] <ChoHag> Never mind socket's internals until you're hacking on the C library.
[00:06:04] <ChoHag> Follow its API.

[00:11:41] <fizzie> Your code might hypothetically be looking roughly like `char buf[SIZE], *response; while ((n = read(s, buf, SIZE)) > 0) { response = realloc(response, size + n); memcpy(response + size, buf, n); size += n; }` (modulo error checks and maybe a fancier realloc strategy), and the part I'm mildly objecting to is the fact that every single byte is copied twice, from "the socket" (whatever that means under the
[00:11:43] <fizzie> hood) into `buf` and then from `buf` into `response`.

[07:07:46] <ravella> tusko: well, I don't think this is the issue, but your `int alloc` should probably be size_t
[07:08:47] <tusko> Ok, I fixed that. It just runs up to the point where it prints the file size and then it hangs
[07:09:45] <chung> cuppajoe: You probably read them and store in a linked list of struct then sort the score prior to displaying.
[07:09:54] <ravella> tusko: strlen(buff) looks suspicious, it hasn't been initialized with a null-terminated string

[07:10:47] <tusko> Wouldn't buff = calloc(1024, sizeof(char)); do that?
[07:11:06] <tusko> char* buff = calloc(1024, sizeof(char));
[07:11:15] <ravella> tusko: ah, I see. but then the first char is always 0, so strlen will always be 0..?
[07:11:40] <tusko> interesting, ok, I didn't know
[07:11:59] <tusko> maybe if I go back to malloc
[07:12:12] <ravella> in C, buffers don't keep track of their sizes. You need to store the size separately in a size_t, and keep track of it

[07:17:39] <ravella> tusko: People get into heated fights about that. My preference is to avoid C strings when possible, and use Pascal-ish strings (i.e. a struct that contains a char* and a size_t)
[07:18:07] <ravella> it makes it easier to deal with buffer growing/shrinking/concat'ing, but harder to interface with string.h and other libc functions
[07:19:03] <gnoo> you could probably return -1 from grow after call perror. that way you won't have to check the size later, just that grow succeeded or not
[07:19:04] <ravella> but I know I'm probably in the minority :)
[07:20:11] <oldlaptop> It's probably a good idea to make sure your pointer+length strings are \0-terminated too.

[07:23:34] <ravella> funny enough, I don't think Unix/PDP-11 would have failed if they had gone with Pascal strings. Sure, each string takes up more space, but you reduce memory in other ways (substrings don't need to be memcpy'd to a new buffer)
[07:24:10] <tusko> Is there some way to have realloc() put a \0 at the end of the resized buffer?
[07:24:45] <oldlaptop> novns: You can probably walk into a store right now and buy yourself a computer with 128 octets of RAM. (Find some consumer product with an attiny in it.)

[07:24:55] <dave0> why store the length with the string? just use a tuple with pointer & size
[07:24:56] <novns> tusko, yes, buffer[size - 1] = '\0';

[07:26:56] <tusko> gnoo, I don't fully understand.
[07:27:42] <gnoo> in this: you're checking to see if growing the buffer succeeded or not, right? while(strlen(buff) < size) { grow(buff, size); }
[07:28:18] <tusko> I'm checking if the buffer is smaller than the whole size of the file. If it isn't I grow it to be at least that big.

[07:59:32] <tusko> gnoo, does that grow function really preserve the value of the buffer or does it wipe it out with a new buffer of random data
[08:02:20] <gnoo> it preserves the value of buffer, i think. you could also just use temp=realloc(buff,alloc);
[08:02:44] <gnoo> but it's equivalent so not really needed.
[08:04:19] <gnoo> one thing i don't know is: how does realloc know how much the old size is so that it copies old contents?
[08:05:38] <aghast> gnoo, the malloc subsystem has to know the sizes of allocated blocks so it can manage them after free. So "it just knows" due to internal data.
[08:07:11] <gnoo> oh, right! can we know that value in C? probably not, right?
[08:07:46] <tusko> The thing is I'd like this function https://bpa.st/MNVQ not to even run if buff is already bigger than newsize
[08:07:56] <aghast> Not in standard C, since the standard doesn't specify an interface for that. Different allocators have different implementations, so you might find one that provides that API, or documents how it stores the data.
[08:08:45] <gnoo> aghast: thanks!
[08:09:12] <gnoo> tusko: you can either pass the old size or check if the old size is sufficient before calling the function
[08:10:49] <aghast> https://codegrepr.com/question/determine-size-of-dynamically-allocated-memory-in-c/
[08:11:00] <dave0> tusko: buff should really be a global variable ... what you have now is a copy of buff which is lost after grow() returns
[08:11:09] <dave0> tusko: you could also make it static
[08:11:10] <aghast> But in general you're better off if you can retain the size yourself.
[08:11:42] <dave0> oh no forget about static

[11:11:29] <slact[m]> there is no clear answer
[11:12:24] <sham1> Yes
[11:13:08] <dave0> time gcc main.c   time clang main.c
[11:13:26] <ChoHag> On my computer GCC has 4802 source files and LLVM has 28576, so clearly LLVM is better.
[11:13:53] <slact[m]> also llvm has a dragon, and gcc has some stupid cow for a mascot

[11:14:32] <ChoHag> dave0: Steak.
[11:14:38] <sham1> GCC's assembly fragments are like a Scheme while that's not the case for llvm. Clearly GCC wins

[11:15:57] <sham1> But yeah. WRT. GCC vs Clang, what are we comparing? The quality of the output?
[11:16:04] <slact[m]> llvm builds via a virtual machine, whereas GCC doesn't. we all know containers are superior, and virtual machies are type s of containers. therefor llvm is best suited for microservices and is clearly superior.
[11:16:22] <sham1> Like with speed and performance, the speed of what

[19:34:41] <ioxzev1z> sham1, in C null is 0, NULL is usually (void *) 0. Not sure how you could apply the void * cast to a return value
[19:35:15] *** Joins: wroathe (~wroathe@user/wroathe)
[19:36:24] <clarity> Where in the standard is null defined?
[19:36:33] <ioxzev1z> clarity, can't remember, but
[19:36:36] <sham1> stddef.h IIRC, so that's the relevant section
[19:36:45] <ioxzev1z> '\0', 0, and 00000000 are all null
[19:36:53] <ioxzev1z> NULL is (void *) 0; (usually)

[19:37:21] <caze> clarity: 6.4.4.4
[19:37:45] <sham1> But yeah, in Plan9 one doesn't exit the program by returning from main, but by using exits. And of course it takes `const char *` as an argument (because it's a string) and thus passing in 0 will be the same as passing in NULL because of course 0 is, as you said, NULL

[19:39:08] <sham1> Unicode takes ASCII but it doesn't assign actual names for control characters, making U+0000 <control>
[19:39:18] <ioxzev1z> Inline, the cast doesn't apply there because the cast on a return doesn't actually change the bits that are returned

[19:39:50] <ioxzev1z> Inline, a cast works to tell the compiler to treat the bits as a specific type, but the bits stay the same
[19:39:52] <caze> ioxzev1z: But since ASCII isn't required in C, the C spec also defines it.
[19:39:58] <sham1> For example if you cast an integer to a pointer, the implementation is free to convert the underlying bit representation
[19:40:22] <sham1> Because the conversion from integers to pointers is implementation-defined
[19:41:35] <fizzie> ASCII-63 (aka ASA X3.4-1963) defines the character with code 0 as NULL. ;)

[19:50:58] <ioxzev1z> ChoHag, as just discussed, = NULL; should set the pointer value to whatever a null pointer value is
[19:51:08] <ChoHag> Yes, which may or may not be 0x0.

[23:43:39] <oscurochu> so how do i use malloc with this example? (btw, i've found i dont even need the array, but im sure this will come up again)
[23:43:58] <clarity> You would use calloc
[23:44:10] <clarity> int *array = calloc(number_of_elements, sizeof *array)
[23:44:39] <clarity> Or reallocarray
[23:44:47] <oscurochu> i dont know the number of elements
[23:44:52] <clarity> Of course you do
[23:44:58] <oscurochu> oh, i?
[23:44:58] <clarity> You must know if you want to allocate space for them
[23:45:31] <oscurochu> so i'd have to run a loop to count the elements before creating an array to store them?
[23:45:53] <clarity> I guess, if that's how you can figure out how many elements you have.

[23:46:20] <NRK> no, u allocate as much as you think u will need. and if you need more, you grow the array.
[23:46:28] <ski> you "know the number of elements" doesn't mean you know it, when you're writing the program. it means that, at that point in execution, at run-time, you'll know the number, and you are able to express this run-time dependent number as an expression, in your source code
[23:47:03] <ski> (this is why i asked for the definition of `mpc_ast_t')
[23:47:32] *** Joins: de-facto (~de-facto@user/de-facto)
[23:48:44] <ski> hmm .. i guess `mpc_ast_t' is a tree type ?
[23:48:54] <ski> did you intend for this `min' function to be recursive ?
[23:49:25] <ioxzev1z> Where the code at?

[23:49:54] <ski> <oscurochu> is there a way it improve this? like have one loop instead of two? https://dpaste.com/B6E5UXW36

[23:50:46] <oscurochu> i could make it recursive. it really doesnt matter if it is or not. this is all just for learning's sake and isnt necessarily a serious project
[23:50:49] <SamuelMarks> How do I handle errors in C? - `if((code) == -1) { int _code = fputs(strerror(errno), stderr); if (_code == EOF) { fputs(strerror(errno), stderr) } } `
[23:51:00] <SamuelMarks> but that's impossibru
[23:51:11] *** Joins: epony (epony@user/epony)
[23:51:15] <SamuelMarks> Because it would be infinite error printing -> error fail to print
[23:51:35] <ioxzev1z> Not impossibru, just think logically
[23:51:37] <ski> oscurochu : "it really doesnt matter if it is or not" -- it matters, in the sense of handling more possible inputs, or less possible inputs. if you mean to handle arbitrary trees, then you'd better be recursive (or simulate your own recursion ..)
[23:52:16] <SamuelMarks> ioxzev1z - So the first `fputs` could fail, so then I add a second `fputs` to print the error, but the second one could fail, and so on ad-infinitum
[23:52:36] <clarity> Well, what do you want to do if writing to strerr is not possible?
[23:52:39] <nitrix> SamuelMarks, You can silence the error, log it to a file, retry or halt the application.
[23:52:40] <ioxzev1z> if(err) { print_muh_error(); exit() }
[23:53:01] <SamuelMarks> ioxzev1z - But how do I handle error failing to print?
[23:53:07] <nitrix> With code.
[23:53:08] <clarity> abort()
[23:53:33] <SamuelMarks> not sure that's what I'm asking for clarity
[23:53:35] <ioxzev1z> SamuelMarks, if the print fails then exit/abort is literally the only option
[23:53:44] <SamuelMarks> kk
[23:53:53] <NRK> you're the first person ive met who's concerned about print failing
[23:53:53] <clarity> It's not literally the only option
[23:53:53] <SamuelMarks> Just didn't know if there was something else avail
[23:53:57] <ioxzev1z> Like with malloc returning NULL you will 99.99% of the time just abort
[23:53:58] <clarity> You could literally ignore it and move on
[23:54:10] <ioxzev1z> SamuelMarks, you very rarely need to check print return value

[23:54:25] <SamuelMarks> NRK - I'm trying to handle all the possible errors in my program (well, without writing a proof and model checker that is to say)
[23:54:31] <nitrix> SamuelMarks, Handling not being able to write to stderr isn't complicated. fprintf tells you when it fails, you can check the result. You have all the tools you need. All that's left is determining what "handling" entails. What do you want to do when you can't write to stderr?
[23:55:11] <clarity> Yes, the right question to ask is what's appropriate for your application?
[23:55:18] <SamuelMarks> nitrix - Is there a standard solution? - Should I just pass on the integer return all the way up to main? - Which failure code do I give, the first, second, or last error?
[23:55:19] <clarity> There's no one right answer
[23:55:41] <clarity> The standard solution is to not give a crap about printf to stderr failing
[23:56:12] <NRK> if you're in an unstable system where print is failing, i dunno if I'd trust main return code..
[23:57:36] <ioxzev1z> SamuelMarks, if you're writing a library you want to pass errors back and forth, but with a program, if something fails such that you cannot go on, you exit
[23:57:57] <clarity> Libraries generally speaking shouldn't be writing to stderr anyway
[23:58:14] <ioxzev1z> clarity, by that I mean return values, not printing
[23:58:17] <clarity> Sure

[23:59:38] <nitrix> SamuelMarks, Something somewhere eventually has to give up. Otherwise you'll end up digging yourself a hole and bubbling the problem down to what's essentially physics with electrons and quantum mechanics.
