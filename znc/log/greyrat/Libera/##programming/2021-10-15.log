[00:00:17] <novns> want an error message of 100 screens of text with the actual error somewhere in the middle - use C++
[00:00:17] <manicennui> I don't even know why C and C++ bother with newer standards.
[00:00:21] <kre10s> I once had just written a beautiful compression lib in C... and then the higherups were like. 'but can you do it in c++' for absolytely no reason.
[00:00:33] <sonny> to work on windows
[00:00:39] <pulse> kre10s, just rename .c to .cpp
[00:00:40] <pulse> done!

[00:00:45] <sonny> lol
[00:01:11] <LiaoTao> manicennui, That's a bit disingenuous. Lots of new projects are written in C++17 and it's only 4 years old in name and 3 years old in usability
[00:01:21] <sonny> oof
[00:01:30] <manicennui> LiaoTao: Far more people are afraid to leave 11.
[00:01:34] <sonny> *new project* in C++?!
[00:01:34] <pulse> C++23 is around the corner
[00:01:41] <sonny> why lol
[00:01:43] <pulse> sonny, yes, i'm just making one
[00:01:55] <sonny> yeah, I probably will too lmao
[00:02:01] <novns> the main users of C++ is developers of games.  and they usually have the strict rule to NEVER USE TEMPLATES
[00:02:03] <pulse> i really enjoy writing C++, idk why it gets so much hate
[00:02:07] <kre10s> I just wish our compiler supported C++14 ...
[00:02:12] <pulse> novns, untrue, i use templates a lot and am gamedev :p
[00:02:14] <sonny> why? since I'm on windows

[00:02:19] <novns> they just use C++ as C with classes
[00:02:26] <sonny> novns what's the point of that rule?
[00:02:43] <sonny> so you can get namespaces?
[00:02:45] <novns> and screw templates, exceptions and other bloaty baggage
[00:02:56] <LiaoTao> lmao so much FUD here
[00:03:02] <novns> sonny, the point is productivity
[00:03:11] <sonny> I see
[00:03:20] <kre10s> novns: Yes! and then... they throw MISRA at you hahaha. 
[00:03:30] <sonny> I just imagined they wanted generics
[00:03:37] <novns> templates can be fun but you have to get the job done
[00:03:49] <pulse> i love C too, but any time i want to use it i remember it doesn't have strings
[00:04:00] <novns> and using templates is all about solving problems of using templates
[00:04:17] <pulse> templates are just a way to generate code with code
[00:04:19] <novns> it just eats all your time
[00:04:21] <sonny> pulse good point
[00:04:43] <pulse> it's a time saving measure, but it can get ridiculously complex
[00:04:59] <pyzozord> like what are attributes. what are concepts. It's just so much. Such big commitment.
[00:05:08] <novns> pulse, it always gets ridiculously complex
[00:05:11] <pulse> pyzozord, that's why you commit to a subset
[00:05:16] <pulse> novns, nah, you can keep it simple
[00:05:19] <pulse> i usually try to

[00:05:23] <tane> pulse, and requires a huge amount of time to be compiled :)
[00:05:25] <novns> that's why using templates is banned in gamedev
[00:05:34] <pulse> tane, precompiled headers have been a thing for a long time now
[00:05:39] <kre10s> The problem is that C++ is too powerfull. It's dificult to find a good programmer who knows it well. Knows which rabbit holes to stay away from. That's why all that legacy code is so hard to work with.

[00:10:22] <pyzozord> sonny: like for example a lot of the parser/compiler ideas where predicated on slow computer performance
[00:10:30] <pyzozord> it's a non-problem right now
[00:10:30] <pulse> C++ is the main fabric for the modern tech world
[00:10:34] <pulse> along with C
[00:10:36] <sonny> nah
[00:10:37] <pulse> those will forever be relevant
[00:10:42] <pulse> C even more so
[00:10:43] <novns> micrex22, but delphi has lost its positions to electron-like apps
[00:10:58] <pulse> Delphi has been irrelevant for a long time, outside of the car industry (or so i hear)
[00:10:58] <manicennui> Delphi lost to the web long ago.
[00:11:00] <sonny> nothing from parsing is outdated yet
[00:11:03] <novns> scada developers still use delphi
[00:11:04] <sonny> or compilers
[00:11:13] <micrex22> pulse: there are a lot of projects and software still built with it
[00:11:22] <pulse> i heard the car industry still uses it a lot
[00:11:24] <micrex22> It used to be the main thing for win32 development
[00:11:24] <pulse> idk how true that is
[00:11:27] <manicennui> Fortunately we'll have Java forever.

[00:13:48] <pulse> manicennui, because people think C is outdated, horrible, buggy, unsafe, you name it

[00:13:56] <manicennui> pulse: it is.
[00:13:59] <pulse> but all real code depends on C
[00:14:00] <pyzozord> but also c will can quite safely stay relevant for the next 50 years because of linux
[00:14:00] <diophantoz> what other languages besides C is hardware close and still high level
[00:14:05] <manicennui> pulse: But it also underlies everything.
[00:14:09] <diophantoz> besides the C derivates
[00:14:12] <pyzozord> although I'm not fully sure that linux will stay relevant for next 50 years

[00:14:25] <manicennui> C ABIs will be with us for a long, long time.
[00:14:25] <novns> C will stay forever for low level things
[00:14:31] <pulse> pyzozord, you could make Linux vanish overnight and C would still be king

[00:42:24] <pulse> yeah, i can imagine

[00:42:59] <manicennui> Yeah, they have been buying up the rights to a lot of books and comics.
[00:43:03] <manicennui> So that is one route.
[00:43:12] <manicennui> But writing a popular book isn't easy either.
[00:43:29] <pulse> if you're sufficiently inspired and have writing talent, shouldn't be that hard

[01:42:12] <whatsupdoc> What's the difference between integration tests and unit tests?
[01:42:32] <arahael> whatsupdoc: TDD is a style of dev where you write unit tests first, and you're deliberately allowing your implementation to be easily tested as a result.  i am a huge fan but it has its place, eg, i wouldnt use it for UI work.

[01:48:37] <whatsupdoc> Is BDD basically you have someone execute your program and perform steps on it and see if you get the desired behavior?
[01:48:48] <whatsupdoc> Is it a manual process?

[04:16:57] <[itchyjunk]> I can't shrink the size, can i?
[04:17:06] <pulse> that's not what immutable means
[04:17:15] <[itchyjunk]> If i have an int[] a = {1,2}; and i want something with {1},  i have to make a new one
[04:17:19] <[itchyjunk]> oh it's not? what is that called?
[04:17:28] <[itchyjunk]> where i can't shrink the size or add new index?
[04:17:38] <vdamewood> Arrays are fixed-sized, yes.
[04:17:53] <pulse> use one of the many dynamic containers
[04:17:55] <[itchyjunk]> Strings are immutable?
[04:18:15] <[itchyjunk]> No, i am not trying to do something where use something else other than array is the solution
[04:18:22] <[itchyjunk]> i'd just trying to figure out the theory
[04:18:22] <vdamewood> [itchyjunk]: the reason why is because arrays are contiguous in memory. If you add a new element, it has to be ad the end, but you might have another object in that chunk of memory already.
[04:18:42] <[itchyjunk]> right, that's what i thought. its on stack memory right?
[04:18:48] <vdamewood> No.
[04:18:50] <[itchyjunk]> so things like list would be on heap?
[04:18:51] <[itchyjunk]> oh
[04:18:53] <[itchyjunk]> it's on heap?
[04:19:00] <[itchyjunk]> so things like list would be on stack?
[04:19:46] <vdamewood> No. Everything in Java is on the heap except for simple types like int, float, and such.
[04:20:13] <vdamewood> Or, another way to say it, all objects in Java are on the heap.
[04:20:36] <[itchyjunk]> oh, so this memory assignment thing between list and array is not because of heap vs stack
[04:20:38] <[itchyjunk]> :(
[04:20:44] * [itchyjunk] knows nothing then
[04:22:19] <[itchyjunk]> if so, why design array to begin with?
[04:22:40] <[itchyjunk]> seems to be some archiac thing left in there?
[04:24:00] <pulse> this is why people should learn C first :D
[04:24:32] <vdamewood> C is for coding, that's good enough for me.
[04:24:41] <pulse> arrays are very lightweight
[04:24:44] <pulse> no additional cruft needed
[04:24:53] <pulse> if all you need is a fixed size container, arrays are great
[04:25:23] <[itchyjunk]> so lists are heavy weight?
[04:25:28] <[itchyjunk]> in what sense? memory?
[04:25:31] <[itchyjunk]> access time?
[04:25:38] <yitz> Heavy is relative
[04:25:39] <[itchyjunk]> emotional baggate?
[04:25:59] <Decker> 'is something wrong with the earths gravity in the future?'
[04:26:00] <pulse> lists have code
[04:26:06] <pulse> arrays are just arrays
[04:26:19] <[itchyjunk]> hmm
[04:26:27] <vdamewood> With arrays, you just addmemory addresses to access the nth element.
[04:26:35] <[itchyjunk]> it's almost as if lists are more primitive but they are not `primitive` in java
[04:26:47] <vdamewood> With lists, you access a memory address, then another, then another, and so on until you 'find' the one you want.

[08:43:01] <smallville7123> but basically, from kde:
[08:43:04] <smallville7123> A library is binary compatible, if a program linked dynamically to a former version of the library continues running with newer versions of the library without the need to recompile.
[08:43:04] <smallville7123> If a program needs to be recompiled to run with a new version of library but doesn't require any further modifications, the library is source compatible.

[09:11:46] <smallville7123> if in glibc 5, strlen COUNTS the null terminator, and in glibc 6 strlen DOES NOT COUNT the null terminator, then strlen will return different lengths in glibc 5 and 6, thus it's behaviour will be different

[09:19:08] <smallville7123> the compiled binaries, or rather the ABI, will not change if the library is recompiled using the same compiler it was compiled with, preferable the exact same compiler in terms of the ABI level specified by the compiler
[09:19:41] <smallville7123> eg if gcc 5 and gcc 6 both offer say ABI version 4, the both gcc 5 and gcc 6 will compile an application using the exact same ABI

[09:23:26] <vdamewood> Exactly.
[09:23:37] <smallville7123> for an application only the ABI level matters
[09:23:57] <vdamewood> dllcache: It might help to explain the different concepts involved in an ABI.
[09:24:02] <smallville7123> unless it is both an application AND a library (unusual but is possible)
[09:24:26] <smallville7123> for a library, both the ABI version and the API version matters
[09:24:33] <vdamewood> For example, a system can have a specification for hall function calls are handled in machine code on a particular processor. That's one concept called an ABI.
[09:24:52] *** Quits: rtypo (~alex@user/rtypo) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[09:25:27] <vdamewood> s/hall/all/
[09:26:14] <smallville7123> also that same concept is not nessicarily the only form of ABI
[09:26:18] <vdamewood> The idea you mentioned of a 'compiled version of an API' is close to another concept of an ABI, that is the library's ABI, however, it's not as simple as that.
[09:26:50] <vdamewood> Because a library's ABI is also tied to the system ABI it was built with.
[09:27:25] <dllcache> Hmm so ABIs are created when compilers are built.
[09:27:38] <smallville7123> no
[09:27:52] <smallville7123> well yes
[09:28:03] <smallville7123> the ABI itself is complex
[09:28:04] <vdamewood> ABIs are usually created when someone write a document saying "The Foo System ABI and Calling Conventions"
[09:28:56] <smallville7123> eg an ABI can have specifications for numorous specifications that need to match in order for a program to be compatible with the API, for example, it may have a specification for how a function call is implemented, and it may also have a specification for how a function return value is implemented
[09:29:44] <smallville7123> Kernel's usually have their own ABI as well
[09:30:08] <dllcache> So I am right.
[09:30:25] <smallville7123> for example, the kernel may have an specification for how a system call should be implemented

[09:30:38] <vdamewood> for example, if on one system, the convention is that the first four arguments are stored in registers 7, 8, 9, and 10 when a function is called, and another system says to store them in memory pointed to by register 2, they have incompatible ABIs, and a library build for one wont' be compatible with an application made for the other.
[09:30:50] *** Joins: qbt (~qbt@user/edun)
[09:31:05] <smallville7123> for example microsoft kernel and linux kernel have requirements of implementing and declaring a system call
[09:31:14] <vdamewood> dllcache: It's a kind of-sort of but not really situation.

[09:31:39] <smallville7123> thus you could say they have a different system call ABI, that is part of a larger ABI
[09:32:45] <smallville7123> vdamewood: that too :)
[09:33:01] <dllcache> It's just like assembly instructions of a microprocessors.
[09:33:41] <vdamewood> it' not 'just like' them, it is them.
[09:34:08] <smallville7123> which is an example for a "function call specification" ABI
[09:34:21] <vdamewood> Also called a calling convention
[09:34:26] <smallville7123> yea
[09:34:46] <smallville7123> this usually also applies to the return value
[09:35:04] <smallville7123> eg one system may store in register 1, and another in register 3
[09:36:59] <vdamewood> dllcache: It not so much that 'compiled version of an API' is wrong, it's that it's missing additional information.
[09:38:20] <vdamewood> I guess another way to put it is, if I build a library for Windows and for Linux, they will have totally different ABIs even though they have the same ABI.
[09:38:47] <vdamewood> Wheras when I compile a function, it's body will often be the same on both systems after being compiled, especially if by the same compiler.

[09:39:55] <dllcache> So, can I use c/c++ to write an abi,just like I can use it to write the kernel, compilers, interpreters?
[09:40:32] <vdamewood> You don't really write an ABI, you specify it (on paper or in a PDF) and conform to it in your code.
[09:42:48] <dllcache> So ABIs are only specifications?
[09:44:09] <vdamewood> System ABIs are. The AbI of a library though, is the combination of that specification, and the 'compiled version of an API'.
[09:44:27] <vdamewood> Or how a compiled API confirms to that specification.

[11:32:02] <Quietwalker> vdamewood: That was shot in a little town called "Woodstock" in illinois.  about 30 or so minutes from lake geneva, or say an hour and 10 minutes from Milwaukee.
[11:32:26] <vdamewood> Cool.
[11:32:30] <Quietwalker> which is important because when my dad had some of the early blue-and-white-photocopy style first edition books, he got them pretty locally.

[16:25:38] <pulse> yes
[16:25:53] <vdamewood> I thinkI learned that when I was 8 or so.
[16:25:55] <pulse> "Owls eat other animals, from small insects such as moths or beetles, to large birds"
[16:26:06] <pulse> i thought they ate like, apples
[16:26:10] <pulse> and berries
[16:26:29] <beaky> they look kawaii but they're like apex predators
[16:26:29] <vdamewood> Though, the teachers focused on owls eating mice.
[16:26:31] <merijn> I found quite some "owl balls" (not sure if that's an english term, but Google Translate seems to think so)
[16:26:54] <merijn> vdamewood: I've seen quite a few as mouse skeletons in those as a kid, so

[16:28:02] <vdamewood> merijn: Oh, yes. Owl Pellet makes sense.
[16:28:44] <merijn> You find them with entire digested mouse skeletons, which quickly eliminates any notion of vegetarian owls ;)
[16:28:46] <vdamewood> merĳn: FWIW, in English, with anything to do with animals, 'balls' is usually interpreted as 'testicles'.
[16:29:21] <merijn> vdamewood: I mean "ballen" (which is just balls) would generally be the same
[16:29:43] <vdamewood> merĳn: Ah, but in this particular case 'ballen' is the technical term?
[16:29:57] <merijn> vdamewood: It's just that the compound form of uilenbal (with uil = owl en bal = ball, obviousl) means owl pellets :p
[16:30:04] <PamiPetteri> is it "palle" in Italian?
[16:30:19] <TJ-> merijn: "owl pellets" for the regurgitated bones/hair/skin 
[16:30:25] <PamiPetteri> "Palle" is a man's name in Swedish, but not in Finnish. In Finnish "ball" is "pallo" and "testicle" is "palli".

[20:21:14] <InPhase> juliaEnv: I find in general overtime pay is pretty rare in skilled salaried work.  But this is why it's essential to seek employment some place that respects its workers as humans, and wants to retain talent by respecting a healthy work-life balance.
[20:21:21] <yeirr> welcome to public institutions and any G-linked companies
[20:23:05] <InPhase> juliaEnv: I accept a little overtime work here and there.  There are crunch times when things are due, as a reality.  But if crunch time requiring excessive hours is all the time, then it's a management issue, either within one's chain or organization-wide.  Long term this tends to lead to brain-drain as people who can get better jobs do.
[20:23:07] <[itchyjunk]> InPhase, what is a cpu?
[20:23:26] <InPhase> [itchyjunk]: Central processing unit?  :)
[20:23:29] <manicennui> I haven't worked overtime for years.
[20:23:36] <manicennui> Crunch time is almost always bullshit.
[20:23:41] <manicennui> Most deadlines are arbitrary. 
[20:24:42] <juliaEnv> InPhase I have assessed there are different clients that the consultancy has a contract with, and that consultants are allocated different projects. Some projects are good and there is a mutual satisfaction. Many people are happy, and seem to work little. Then, there is also the opposite extreme of some crazy projects that I would never take on, never agree to keep, and I would immediately leave such projects to someone 
[20:24:42] <juliaEnv> else (nobody would like them). But it somehow happened, that such projects are assigned to me.
[20:24:51] <InPhase> manicennui: Well in my current line of work it has to due with things like grant reporting deadlines, which sometimes aren't allowed to be moved, and other times are risky to move because it risks defunding salaries for many people.

[20:26:07] <[itchyjunk]> juliaEnv, maybe because you get it done?
[20:26:19] <[itchyjunk]> everyone else probably just works 40 hours and leaves it at that
[20:26:22] <InPhase> manicennui: In my previous position, crunch times involved grade submission deadlines, which can't really move because it disrupts way too much downstream.  So there are things that are not arbitrary.  Sometimes people create artificial deadlines just to light fires under people, but this should not be a thing used regularly to induce overtime work.
[20:26:23] <juliaEnv> I'm about to approach other companies and get something else done now :)

[20:29:12] <manicennui> Work gets done faster when your current systems and procedures aren't fucked up.
[20:29:14] <juliaEnv> well, at one of the top consultancies in the world, deadlines are based on offers that are made before being able to read what the client actually needs, and then the client sends you hundreds of pages after the client has accepted your offer, and you then have to deliver something that has no correlation with the deadline whatsoever. And you cannot renegotiate it.
[20:29:19] <[itchyjunk]> they always wanted to do it , just didn't have a good enough excuse to push it

[21:08:21] <kodah> as i became a senior engineer the things i think *in this moment* are easy are often viewed as difficult.
[21:08:26] <manicennui> There was a point in my teens when I didn't quite get some things in software development.
[21:08:27] <kodah> i just have a lot of old knowledge now
[21:08:36] <manicennui> But it was mostly because I had not experienced where those things were useful.
[21:09:08] <manicennui> And I didn't really know how to navigate the corporate world.
[21:09:10] <kodah> plus, people coming out of school don't have the benefit of troubleshooting an OS or program that doesn't work on first boot, so there's less exposure to the innards and underlying cruft
[21:09:11] <manicennui> That was the key really.

[21:36:15] <InPhase> [itchyjunk]: Simply go through and check required experience and skill level, and avoid clicking on titles that are obviously senior.
[21:37:53] <InPhase> [itchyjunk]: The reason for this is that nobody will require no experience.  They will simply sometimes not require specific work experience and have work that someone entry level could do.  It might constitute age discrimination or other things to exclude experienced people in the requirements, so you will pretty much never see something like "Less than 3 years of experience".  :)
[21:38:30] <InPhase> [itchyjunk]: Entry level positions are therefore established by senior people preferentially applying to other stuff.

[22:29:06] <InPhase> mrig: I currently view C++ as an end-stage language, good for use for a little while, saddled by its own weight, and functioning primarily as a testbed for the next language generations while slowly self-destructing its utility with complexity that will probably cause new developers to avoid it at some point.
[22:29:17] <mrig> I might feel half way competent after another 5 years :|
[22:30:02] <InPhase> mrig: Maybe I'm wrong and they'll find some way to salvage it by a pile of enforced conventions rendering portions into legacy-C++ that people can skip learning, but I just don't see how that will work out.
[22:30:42] <InPhase> Right now it's just at that stage where new developers can learn it and thrive with a long investment that still pays off.  But this ratio seems likely to switch as things keep getting added.
[22:30:44] <pyzozord> the biggest problem of C++ is the "C" part
[22:31:15] <mrig> InPhase: it is an amazing feat of human ingenuity and its gaining the Faraday award for its author does that great justice, but I can't shake the sense that this really is still all very much untested ground, a new field even after 60 years.
[22:31:15] <pyzozord> thta language want's to be just "++"
[22:31:17] <InPhase> And that perspective comes from C++ being one of my favorite languages.
[22:31:59] <InPhase> I still think it's nearing its end stage anyway.  I've watched other languages I really liked fade away from utility, so it does happen regularly.

[22:57:24] <pulse> jeaye, languages are like cars. if you make them go fast they are dangerous. you can mitigate some of the danger but you can't ever fully avoid it :)
[22:57:40] <pulse> i believe the vast majority of security holes are caused by people, not languages
[22:58:02] <pulse> as such i don't consider C and C++ particularly unsafe. i fully admit i could be wrong though, i'm not a security researcher
[22:58:03] <sonny> pretty much

[23:01:03] <sonny> then, it's also weird to want manual allocation in application languages / use systems languages for apps
[23:01:19] <pulse> i'm also pretty sure we won't ever replace C or C++, until the programming paradigm shifts considerably
[23:01:24] <pulse> which won't happen in our lifetimes
[23:01:32] <pulse> maybe in like 2400 or something
[23:01:32] <mrig> I had a thought today, after using a native windows install for the first time in ages, that windows 'feels' like c++ where as linux 'feels' like C.

[23:02:27] <mrig> the encapsulation and where the the abstractions have been put.
[23:02:41] <pyzozord> and I weakly disagree because I believe that making languages more complex only invites human error. Languages should be simple to the point where programmers who make mistakes make them because they are bad programmers not because they forgot or misunderstood some crazy language feature
[23:03:06] <mrig> sure yes, but symmetry's do have a funny way of 'emerging' all by them selves.

[23:44:02] <wedr> Unless you have nothing to lose
[23:44:10] <Quietwalker> Well, time spent.
[23:44:18] <mrig> CaCode: there is the swab function?

[23:44:54] <vdamewood> Quietwalker: Windows 11 is fine for a new system, or a VM, but Windows 10 is still perfectly usable.
[23:45:02] <mrig> vdamewood: oh pink noise too !
[23:45:22] * vdamewood applies blue shift to mrig's pink noise.
[23:45:24] <CaCode> mrig excellent
[23:45:31] <CaCode> I am still trying to find my whisk
[23:45:33] * vdamewood applies blue goo to mrig's pink nose.

[23:45:48] <CaCode> all i found is some whiskey that'll do
[23:46:01] <mrig> blue noise is undoubtedly very hexy though!
[23:46:08] <Rounin> Better have more wine
[23:46:22] <vdamewood> Rounin: Yes, OEM's should be fined for installing Windows 11 on a new system.
[23:46:30] <Rounin> :D
[23:46:47] <CaCode> So do bats sonar or that of dolphins have something equivalent to what we consider color?
[23:47:05] <CaCode> soundwaves go across a frequency spectrum just like visual light
[23:47:35] <CaCode> I'm calling it color-deafness
[23:48:17] <vdamewood> CaCode: Not really, since sound waves don't change frequency based on the surface they hit.
[23:48:33] <mrig> CaCode: the nodes between extremities are found at standing waves so they likely use this for depth perception or some such.

[23:48:54] <mrig> rather than colour it could be distance.
[23:49:08] <mrig> or dimension's.

[23:52:09] <mrig> well a large space has a different sound to a small space because different frequency's are amplified.
