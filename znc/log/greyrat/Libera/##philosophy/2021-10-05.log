[03:38:03] <audrey> Had some minor unpleasantness in another channel
[03:38:14] <audrey> Realizing how toxic a lot of IRC is compared to the places on Discord I hang out in these days
[03:40:55] <biys> yah
[03:40:58] <biys> i'd agree with that
[03:41:19] <biys> but on the other side of things i'm not a fan of people moderating my chats and i feel that discord is typically people who are...  soft
[03:41:31] <biys> people in general are just getting super soft
[03:42:02] <biys> it's easier to just say nothing at all instead of running the risk of offended someone and the infinite amount of positions on any matters now days
[03:42:05] <arryana> i tried to get into discord, but...

[09:43:51] <dfcnvt> It can do damage towards to myself if I continue with my foolish act in believing there's something in the body of Ignorance that will safeguard my "places".
[09:44:17] <dfcnvt> (let me clear that up with "places" -- I should expand..)
[09:45:18] <dfcnvt> ...safeguard my daily practice, my interpretation, my understanding, my whereabout...
[09:49:45] <dfcnvt> So far, all I can say...my body is my vehicle and my mind is my steering control -- and the very fiber of my being...I can senses the pitfall, the suffering, the unrealizing hazards that I would financially harm to myself...
[09:52:43] <dfcnvt> I live in it and continue to do so...Just when will I be awaken to realize that's because I'm in the ocean and not on the land -- that's the sort of spelling that I need to see it. err, not spelling but whatever measurement I need to do against myself or my status or my environment -- and account for these things
[09:53:28] <dfcnvt> I think it's all too late but I need to use my conscious to put into effort and realize anything.
[09:54:36] <dfcnvt> Err, let me JUMP to the very end.  I just think I need to get away into the forest and live in the cabin and learn how to survive without any dependent to the people, the government.
[09:55:52] <dfcnvt> I just need to find the spot and figure out how to harvest food, energy, essential stuff -- and ensure I have the stability that is all in its place for my benefit.

[10:02:33] <dfcnvt> I've been questioning at some time about "philosophy" but I feel like that's a "wrong" place to be in it...Like, I need to know where is that "space" that is designed to help me as a human being to get his shit together and figure out the plan.
[10:02:36] <amigojapan> dfcnvt: philosophy means "love of wisdom
[10:03:45] <amigojapan> dfcnvt: maybe ##psychology ? Dunno I don't think IRC is a good place to get live advice
[10:04:06] <amigojapan> Life advise*
[10:06:07] <amigojapan> dfcnvt: there are too many people that think everything is a joke on IRC
[10:07:09] <dfcnvt> How would you measure the degree of authenticity when it comes to between participant (me/you) and the subject (##philosophy for example) ...?
[10:07:40] <amigojapan> I don't know
[10:07:41] <dfcnvt> Like, while we're here on IRC, I suppose, I should exercise with precaution that...not everything should be dependable -- it's all crapshoot.
[10:08:00] <amigojapan> Yeah
[10:09:10] <dfcnvt> Whereas, sitting in a room at an actual college department with professor -- and there's a label "Philosophy" embroiled on the sidedoor.  That would be the person to have a dialogue with. It is most authentic as close as possible?
[10:09:47] <dfcnvt> I mean, it's obvious.
[10:10:20] <amigojapan> You have no idea who you are talking to on IRC
[10:10:33] <dfcnvt> Just touching on the subject of "degree of authenticity"
[10:10:40] <dfcnvt> Right right.
[10:12:01] <amigojapan> I have repeatedly seen people on IRC tell someone who is suicidal to "kill themselves
[10:12:12] <dfcnvt> I guess, I'm just looking for a cheap way to tap into the space of "supposedly" people of professionalism regarding to the subject...I guess I should have put to test.
[10:13:43] <dfcnvt> ...Yeah, it has to be in a safe place.. I guess some people..or majority of people, don't see that, it can spell it out all the wrong when none of us knows how to help.

[10:15:16] <amigojapan> dfcnvt: are you sure you want to meet a philosopher and not a therapist?
[10:16:03] <plank> if therapists were philosophers the world would be a better place
[10:17:22] <amigojapan> plank: dual degree?
[10:19:19] <dfcnvt> amigojapan: I'm "fine" -- it's hard to define what being fine even means.  I can have conversation-wise that is mentally healthy and is open to any thoughts/sugguestions.   But at the same time, when separating myself to the most realism -- it is the "condition" or "status" that I am "tainted" with if I were to shift my conscious to it, then well, it's just frustration or disappointed...but mostly
[10:19:25] <dfcnvt> just "aware" of it with no emotional reaction to it.
[10:20:52] <dfcnvt> Okay, we're kinda going through a different discourses here -- and I think that's normal when we are linearly stucks to time -- so linearly.
[10:21:08] <dfcnvt> Let's rewind back.
[10:22:35] <dfcnvt> What is the utmost crux of wisdom that philosophy has helped you most?   For me, it's "Allegory of the Cave".
[10:23:18] <amigojapan> dfcnvt: for me it is Cogito ergo sum
[10:24:42] <amigojapan> dfcnvt: that and Socrates saying "the only thing I know it's that I know nothing
[10:25:36] <plank> amigojapan more like changing the idea of what a therapist is supposed to be
[10:25:55] <plank> because obviously as is theyre not doing much to stem the mental health crisis

[10:27:16] <amigojapan> Well plank don't forget that the creator of therapy, Freud, suicided himself, so I don't know why people look for it as a way to prevent suicide
[10:27:42] <plank> idk, suicide is a human right
[10:27:53] <amigojapan> Ok
[10:27:59] <plank> i find it immensely fucked up that people try to make suicidal people feel guilty about their desires
[10:28:25] <plank> like how selfish do you have to be to want to keep a miserable person around just so youll be less miserable
[10:28:49] <amigojapan> plank: if it is a human right, then we should make painless suicide kids available
[10:29:00] <plank> yes
[10:29:06] <plank> duh
[10:29:38] <plank> although tbh id prefer to wait until theyre of voting age
[10:29:45] <amigojapan> Suicided kits*
[10:29:53] <plank> oh well then yes obviously
[10:29:58] <amigojapan> I did but mean kids
[10:30:02] <plank> just have suicide booths like in futurama
[10:30:12] <amigojapan> Ok
[10:30:18] <dfcnvt> What is this thing that divorced us from being sensitive in the actualization of having this type of conversation -- all the while, we're merely "entertaining" ourselves with ideas like this?
[10:30:30] <plank> no, i actually believe this
[10:30:58] <plank> its largely religious moralism that makes people think that suicide is bad
[10:31:01] <plank> and its quite dumb
[10:31:17] <dfcnvt> Kinda like, watching action movie -- all violence involved is "entertaining"..but when it comes to actual crime, it just flip our stomach upside down
[10:31:33] <plank> my uncle killed himself last year
[10:31:48] <plank> i dont blame him for it, he always said if he was so hurt he couldnt work hed shoot himself
[10:31:58] <plank> ended up ODing, which was much less messy for everyone involved
[10:32:20] <plank> dont blame him, but i do blame the fucked up system that forces the burden of dealing with the estate onto the family
[10:33:05] <plank> got a selfie of myself with his dead body before they burned it
[10:33:45] <plank> wearing his ashes around my neck as i type
[10:33:51] <plank> suicide is a stupid taboo
[10:34:31] <plank> there should be services dedicated to helping people get their affairs in order before they off themselves, instead of leaving it for other people to clean up
[10:34:36] <amigojapan> plank: it is taboo in most cultures

[10:37:47] <dfcnvt> I don't really know what to say -- I mean there are some thoughts popped up in my head, but I'm afraid that it might not lead to anything.
[10:38:51] <plank> philosophy is a field for the bold
[10:43:14] <dfcnvt> I think "options" should be clarified regarding the sustainability of living further.  Whichever is actually the most benefits should be highly available and accessible for anyone facing this condition.  Whereas, for suicide program or whatever you call it -- should NOT be openly available...as people may makes mistake for chosing such a direction when they can improve upon...Options should be done
[10:43:14] <dfcnvt> throughly then it's just down to their conscious on whether they should choose it.
[10:43:50] <dfcnvt> I don't know -- basically, what I'm saying is that -- it should be the LAST resort and well hidden....it should be their own conscious, that light it up and say -- "I think i don't want to be here in this body of reality anymore". then onto finding such existing program or this person and do it themselve.

[14:04:19] <Rashad> They will just use the good old rules of modern medicine.
[14:04:34] <Rashad> The rules come from properties of existents.
