We sentence you to death. Execution is at dawn."
[02:38:54] <Deknos> if you do illegal stuff you should look for a country which has no extradition treaty with your country and the country you want to do illegal things
[02:39:27] <mats1> they'll probably not respond to requests from your local govt

[02:41:51] <mats1> a simpler solution is to use your neighbour's wifi
[02:41:56] <Deknos> well then you need a payment thing, which is not traceable and as everybody has the blockchain in 30 years it will be easier to trace blockchain money to you than using ephemeral tor connections
[02:42:19] <Deknos> yeah, get yourself some beefy hardware and use the various wifi networks in your neighbourhood
[02:42:24] <xx> I don't mind paying with my real bank account, it's not for illegal stuff, just for peace of mind
[02:42:45] <mats1> you can rent an array of 3090s on vast.ai by the hour
[02:42:58] <Deknos> but.. then the government could trace your sentences back to you?

[02:50:05] <catbeard> thought that was pretty clear, try it and see
[02:51:05] <catbeard> easy, just hop on vpn 1 and do some illegal things, see how long it takes for you to get arrested, try mullvad when you get out, see how long it takes for you to get arrested

[03:29:51] <joe7057> natewrench123456: true, though there are some things that mitigate it quite well. One is hardware security keys. Google switched to all hardware keys a while ago, and since then their social engineering compromises have been zero.

Hardware keys with FIDO deal with e.g. where a spammer sends and email with a link that looks legit, but is actually a clone, because no matter how convincing the clone, the hardware key will produce a completely different output for that site than it would for the real site.

[03:34:48] <joe7057> I think there is a gif alternative called webp or something. Not 100% sure if it is a free format like webm is though
[03:35:17] <natewrench123456> anyway I was reading how the Uni of Minisota tried to compromise the kernel and why couldnt they fork the kernel then compromise their own kernel
[03:35:44] <catbeard> natewrench123456: they were caught putting shitty updates as PR's into linux kernel
[03:35:57] <catbeard> posing as regular features or updates
[03:36:11] <catbeard> not unlike most of them, but they were doing it intentionally as a project
[03:36:21] <natewrench123456> i imagine if they did that with freebsd they'd get away with it
[03:36:41] <catbeard> probably but i mean really who uses freebsd but hardcore basement dwellers
[03:36:51] <joe7057> natewrench123456: the reason that that would not have worked was that they were not testing if the kernel could be compromised, because obviously it can. What they were testing was if the screening process would catch it or not. IMO that is an important thing. I imagine that if the pull requests were accepted (can't remember if they were or not), they would have given warning befoer they went
[03:36:53] <joe7057> live
[03:36:55] <natewrench123456> well these days were all basement dwellers
[03:37:23] <natewrench123456> pen-testing yea
[03:37:25] <catbeard> joe7057: yeah, but imagine if they didn't give warning
[03:37:55] <catbeard> i don't think it was announced by UOM i think someone caught it and was like wtf are they doing
[03:38:03] <catbeard> on the mailing lists
[03:38:31] <catbeard> LKML or something
[03:38:34] <joe7057> catbeard: exactly. That is what they were testing. Because if they can do it, why can't a malicious actor (especially if they have access to an email address from a reputable institution, like from UOM)
[03:38:46] <catbeard> "all it takes is an .edu email" LOL
[03:38:58] <catbeard> that's like saying "all it takes is a .gov domain" these days
[03:39:05] <natewrench123456> but having a totally freedom OS like trisquel is meaningless without the entire source code along side the binary, plus you need freedom hardware like Cern's Open Hardware License which makes Purism suspect as to how they can develop secure hardware
[03:39:14] <catbeard> just get some of the mayor's letterhead and register yourself a .gov
[03:39:23] <ajak> natewrench123456: you're conflating open source with security
[03:39:27] <joe7057> catbeard: I wasn't saying it was announced this time, I am just saying that seeing as it was a research project, I am sure they would not have allowed actual vulnerabilities to reach the main branch
[03:39:40] <catbeard> yeah, there's regression tests for that
[03:39:53] <ajak> regression tests can't catch novel bugs
[03:40:08] <catbeard> someone will find out about it sooner or later
[03:40:12] <catbeard> and new tests will be designed
[03:40:33] <catbeard> might not be the someone you want
[03:40:36] <natewrench123456> well at most you should immediately fork the software you are using like firefox and do a soft fork or chain because blindly using binaries stamped with libre licenses is stupid like i can stamp a turd as libre and people would use it withotu thought
[03:40:38] <catbeard> but there you go
[03:41:26] <joe7057> catbeard: yes, but the concern is that there will still be people affected. Consider, for example, if the Chinese government were to insert a backdoor. Sure, it might be caught in a few weeks (or months, years) but that doesn't exactly help the dissidents who have now been arrested, who were using a linux-based OS to protect themselves.
[03:41:30] <catbeard> this is why signed commits are a thing
[03:41:45] <catbeard> so the who allowed it is traceable
[03:41:50] <catbeard> and `git blame`
[03:42:06] <joe7057> and why deterministic builds are important, so it can be checked.

[03:42:45] <catbeard> there's other systems outside of the git repository most likely to require multiple reviews/signoffs

[03:43:34] <natewrench123456> right click web page view source
[03:43:47] <joe7057> natewrench123456: isn't that basically what a binary compiled for a debugger is? The issue is the whole point of a binary is it is not source code.
[03:43:49] <ajak> it can, just cat the binary
[03:44:01] <catbeard> yeah binaries that are built with debugging symbols at least
[03:44:09] <joe7057> But yes, theoretically you could #include the source file as a printable string
[03:44:20] <natewrench123456> easy audit
[03:44:26] <joe7057> catbeard: yes thats what I mean
[03:44:37] <ajak> no, there's no way to guarantee random strings in the binary are really the source
[03:44:39] <catbeard> you'd still need to run it through a debugger e.g. gdb for it to be of any use
[03:44:50] <catbeard> depending on what  you're doing
[03:44:55] <natewrench123456> reverse engineer it using a simple command
[03:45:04] <joe7057> natewrench123456: unfortunately that wouldn't really help, since a malicious program could just print out a false program
[03:45:20] <catbeard> reverse engineering a binary is most often anything but simple, at least if your adversary is good at what they're doing
[03:45:43] <natewrench123456> which came first the compiler or the binary that compiled the compiler
[03:45:52] <catbeard> the compiler
[03:46:08] <catbeard> the compiler would have to compile itself

[05:33:11] <catbeard> not like it uses argon2 but i mean
[05:33:21] <catbeard> Guest00: does it need to be encrypted?
[05:33:48] <joe7057> catbeard: I just wanted to make sure that he understood that, because you used the word "encryption", which is not the same thing, and the difference is important
[05:33:49] <Guest00> For PII I think but I am not sure
[05:33:52] <catbeard> if so, should it be per user and also for that user's data
[05:33:57] <Guest00> yes ty joe
[05:34:06] <catbeard> joe7057: i think you're referring to encoding vs encryption
[05:34:29] <catbeard> encoding is reversible, encryption shouldn't be (ideally one way hash comparison only)
[05:34:44] <joe7057> I was trying to use the word "encoding" to refer to storing the password in a form other than plaintext.
[05:34:54] <catbeard> yeah don't reinvent the wheel
[05:35:05] <joe7057> actually "encryption" would be a subset of "encoding"
[05:35:18] <joe7057> what you are referring to is called "hashing"
[05:35:37] <joe7057> encryption is reversible
[05:35:44] <joe7057> e.g. PGP encryption
[05:37:00] <catbeard> sure
[05:37:04] <catbeard> now back to the OP
[05:37:39] <joe7057> it is an important difference to the OP, because he will likely be looking for documentation on how to implement this properly, and looking up "encryption" will not lead him to the right thing
[05:37:42] <catbeard> Guest00: you need to then figure out what PII you want to protect, if you're using WP you can use Disable JSON API to prevent it from being discovered without authorization
[05:37:59] <Guest00> I am not using wp
[05:38:07] <catbeard> ok what are you using
[05:38:11] <Guest00> django
[05:38:26] <Guest00> all i am storing really is email in my db
[05:38:33] <catbeard> so python
[05:38:36] <Guest00> yes
[05:38:52] <Guest00> i am not storing social security as an example
[05:39:25] <catbeard> ok well that's good
[05:39:37] <catbeard> https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cryptography_with_python/cryptography_with_python_quick_guide.htm may point out a few methods for you then
[05:40:36] <catbeard> not definitive resource though, do your research on django specific crypto implementation
[05:40:42] <joe7057> and as usual, make sure you are using a standardized cryptography library that is well-audited
[05:40:47] <Guest00> Yea I know of some but for me it is a lot harder I am using a github library for my authentication so I cannot easily change the database unless I rewrite autheentication from scratch
[05:41:41] <Guest00> and you know how github maintainers are.. i make a PR for them about encrypting the email and they never put it in production :(
[05:42:17] <catbeard> well you're using their software for your use case, so they might not accept a PR
[05:42:31] <Guest00> yea it sucks
[05:42:50] <Guest00> that is why i am thinking about doing everything from scratch just to get the dang email encrypted for PII
[05:42:54] <catbeard> but i mean you could do the same thing, take the hash of the email given compare against hash of email in the db
[05:43:02] <Guest00> are there fines if pii gets leaked?
[05:43:05] <catbeard> yes

[06:00:11] <catbeard> to find out what compliance you need to adhere to
[06:00:15] <Hash> Email is insecure in many regards.
[06:00:22] <Guest00> ok ty all just wanted to see your thoughts since you may have done it before
[06:00:23] <catbeard> and what specifically needs to be safeguarded
[06:00:26] <Hash> We initially built these technologies on trust
[06:00:37] <catbeard> we have, but that has nothing to do with IF something should be encrypted
[06:00:44] <joe7057> ajak: tls is another form of in transit. In transit encryption just means that the content is encrypted while it is transiting.
[06:00:49] <ajak> i know
[06:00:49] <catbeard> that's legal territory
[06:00:57] <Guest00> true
[06:01:12] <Hash> That's why a lot of companies strictly have policies in place for secure email communicatoin
[06:01:24] <joe7057> email was originally built for use withing a network, so it didn't really make sense to have deafult encryption. Same with http
[06:01:37] <Hash> Every employee must hae keypair and pgp and sign emails and encrypt them etc.
[06:01:38] <ajak> joe7057: when someone talks about email encryption they're generally referring to pgp or smime, "in transit" encryption in general tends to mean something at a lower layer
[06:01:58] <Hash> key rotation on a timed basis
[06:02:02] <Hash> etc. etc.
[06:02:36] <catbeard> people often mistakenly refer to email messages as being in a database, i mean it is somewhat, but mostly it's IMAP pseudo-filesystem
[06:02:45] <joe7057> you are right generally, I probably should have been more specific. But it is true nevertheless that a PGP-encrypted email is encrypted in transit whether sent using TLS or plaintext
[06:03:10] <ajak> it's not completely encrypted though so i'm not sure you can really call it that
[06:03:10] <Hash> yeh mbox format etc.
[06:03:18] <catbeard> now as for a separate actual database containing a list of email address strings, that doesn't sound like something that should be "protected" more than anything else
[06:03:18] <joe7057> catbeard: true. But as I understand it in this case Guest00 was literally talking about storing email addresses in a database
[06:03:21] <catbeard> means nothing without a password

[06:11:16] <joe7057> catbeard: but that is through the phone, not through the bank itself. What I mean is that if a criminal gets your password and social engineers the phone company, then they are in. Whereas with something like HSM, they cannot get in unless they physically steal it.

[06:11:37] <joe7057> Even totp codes can be phished, though totp is still far better than SMS
[06:11:40] <catbeard> yes only the bank can steal it from you, but you authorized them to
[06:12:08] <catbeard> yeah TOTP w/ lastpass authenticator (external) for those that don't support biometric
[06:12:24] <catbeard> so it's at least something you know and something you are and something you have technically
[06:12:36] <catbeard> figuring your device is the only device with the TOTP profile
[06:12:54] <joe7057> personally I use andOTP, but any proper implementation of TOTP (not authy) is a huge step up from sms
[06:12:56] <catbeard> and you are the only person that has your finger
[06:13:02] <joe7057> yep
[06:13:03] <catbeard> sometimes that's unclear

[06:13:24] <catbeard> :)
[06:13:33] <joe7057> doesn't even have to be only one device, the important thing is you control all devices with that totp linked
[06:13:59] <catbeard> i wouldn't be opposed to counterverification after fp auth
[06:14:06] <joe7057> in a similar way to how you can have multiple HSMs (and should, in case you lose one. Otherwise recovery can be a huge pain)
[06:14:12] <catbeard> seems to be the one and only auth needed to get to my bank via phone app
[06:14:52] <catbeard> i just don't have it the other way around, i don't allow push messages from my banking app to my phone, i do for other apps which card proxy the bank account
[06:14:56] <joe7057> I don't have as huge an issue with the app for subsequent logins, but I would like to see the option to require HSM for the first login on a new device/app
[06:15:19] <catbeard> like a bank-issued one-time FOB
[06:15:28] <catbeard> or maybe for use as emergency backup recovery
[06:16:26] <joe7057> prefereably just support FIDO keys for authentication, maybe requiring you to link them physically at the bank. The bank could just sell yubikeys or something, and that way it is using a mature standard rather than something proprietary
[06:16:30] <catbeard> or like a hey plug this in to activate your device, it's typeC / lightningbolt kinda thing
[06:16:55] <catbeard> i'd imagine not everyone would want to go for that
[06:16:57] <joe7057> well yubikey already offer USBc/lightning, as well as NFC
[06:17:07] <joe7057> as I said, it should be an option.
[06:17:26] <joe7057> probably a strongly recommended one, since it is actually pretty easy to use, but not necessarily required
[06:17:40] <catbeard> right but you're saying required, but you did also say like to see
[06:17:42] <joe7057> maybe a requirement to allow certain features online, such as large transactions or something

[06:18:03] <joe7057> sorry maybe I wasn't clear, I want to see the option
[06:18:14] <catbeard> most of the people this would be designed to protect (old people with money) isn't going to be easy to train
[06:18:18] <joe7057> what I mean is I want to be able to enable an option for it to be required
[06:18:36] <joe7057> its literally just "plug this into the computer and touch the gold ring"
[06:18:44] <catbeard> yeah but that would have to be at the bank's discretion when they create your account
[06:18:55] <catbeard> to require on first use, as that's not the norm
[06:18:57] <joe7057> just tell them it works like your debit card but for your computer

[06:19:27] <joe7057> I mean online banking account. It would be an option under 2fa settings, same as on any other website.
[06:20:27] <catbeard> they'd have to issue a qrcode for you to scan upon opening the account, and have you confirm a password on their thing, lots of banks will let you type in the password you want on their screens
[06:20:44] <catbeard> like physically if you're in the office opening an account
[06:21:23] <catbeard> even if it's just a temporary password, which it should be, should also enforce password change on first successful login

[06:22:26] <catbeard> i'd imagine new accounts would be under heavy scrutiny by the bank anyway
[06:22:56] <joe7057> true. But todays new accounts are tomorrows established accounts
[06:23:00] <catbeard> so really that's the customer they're looking to protect, one that already trusts the bank
[06:23:47] <catbeard> so it should empower those customers to enhance their security, suddenly requiring it though to re-establish access may not be the best way to go about it

[06:24:25] <catbeard> nobody ever tells the bank
[06:24:27] <catbeard> lol
[06:25:00] <joe7057> I think there has been a misunderstanding here. I do not want to add FIDO as a requirement to access an account. I would simply like to see it as an option for ME to enable to as 2fa on my own online banking account for added security. I would also support it being recommended to people, but not as a requirement.
[06:25:16] <catbeard> sure yeah i get it
[06:25:37] <catbeard> though for that you have to write to your bank
[06:25:44] <catbeard> or sit down with their risk management department
[06:25:57] <joe7057> rue
[06:26:00] <joe7057> true*
[06:26:39] <joe7057> I would not be opposed to it being made into a regulation that banks have to offer it either. But I always prefer the market to enforce these things rather than government.
[06:27:15] <catbeard> right well getting it as a feature would be far easier
[06:27:23] <catbeard> then others may follow suit
[06:27:37] <joe7057> yes hopefully
[06:27:38] <catbeard> and everybody will just copy everyone else's new enhanced security
[06:28:14] <joe7057> yep, because as usual as "leaders of the industry" every bank has to offer the same features as their competitors

[13:26:56] <gas51627> Hi, I am not a native english speaker. In This sentence from oauth2 rfc, does the phrase "... either on behalf of a resource owner ... " refer to the phrase "access to an HTTP service" or the phrase "enables a third-party application..."? In other words, what happens on the behalf of the resource owner: "enabling 3rd party app to obtain limited access" or "limited access to an HTTP service". That comma in front of "either" drives
[13:26:56] <gas51627> me off.

[14:18:44] <gas51627> Well, probably server sends a lost of ciphers it supports and client choses one of it
[14:18:50] <gas51627> list
[14:19:44] <DX099> how are server ciphers decided apart from configuration? I read the certificate itself needs to have some specific parameters for some ciphers to be presented
[14:22:28] *** Joins: sdfgsdfg (~sdfgsdfg@user/sdfgsdfg)
[14:22:29] <gas51627> I dont know. Not sure how certificate is related to the ciphers. Probably server knows which ciphers it supports. But I think its client who decides which cipher to use (from the list provided by a server).
[14:23:03] <gas51627> Or if it does not want to use any of them, it just sends some stop signal
[14:24:27] <gas51627> Probably running curl with vvv or s_client will print all that stuff and it will be visible who is doing what
[14:24:41] <gas51627> Along with cipher list etc

[16:50:11] <pagios> hello, question about ssl termination, i hace a firewall exposed to the internet wit signed CA certificate *.domain.com, i would like to serve that to all clients visiting my websites beinhd the firewall. So i am doing a reverse proxy and doing ssl termination on firewall level. webservers are runnning port 443, my question is can i use self signed certificates on those  and not get a warning from clients visiting coz ssl termination would
[16:50:11] <pagios> be done on firewall
[16:50:28] <pagios> i am trying to see if i can avoid deplyogin tthe signed cert on the backend servers and keep it on the firewall only

[16:53:54] <DX099> SSL termination at firewall means as far as the client is concerned their SSL business is with the firewall
[16:54:46] <DX099> SSLs sessions between the FW & the backend servers are separate and the concern of only the Firewall and the backend servers
[16:56:57] <DX099> if you trust your FW <-> Backend Web network, you can use cleartext there on standard 80 otherwise it is recommended to still have a signed cert on your backend servers as well since a little encryption is better than none even on internal networks

[23:07:56] <SymbioticFemale> who actually monetizes domains like .art? .art is $964 + 36/year
[23:08:05] <SymbioticFemale> who is monetizing this crap
[23:08:20] <SymbioticFemale> who gets paid?
[23:08:20] <s1gyn> I mean people buy NFTs
[23:08:46] <SymbioticFemale> i'm asking who allocates / profits from these top level domains
[23:09:03] <fnk> >The .art TLD was entered into a registry agreement on March 24, 2016, between ICANN and UK Creative Ideas Limited
[23:09:12] <SymbioticFemale> ic
[23:09:16] <fnk> >The founder of UK Creative Ideas and of .art is London-based investor and art collector Ulvi Kasimov, who invested $25 million on the domain initiative
[23:09:22] <fnk> so i guess this guy
[23:09:25] * SymbioticFemale sighs
[23:10:46] <fnk> i guess .nft is coming at some point
[23:12:09] <ajak> oh i'm surprised it doesn't already exist
[23:13:39] <SEP> the .art TLD seems to be only for luxury or premium brands.  Apple, Instagram, Rolex, Louvre, the Art Institute of Chicago, etc.
[23:14:08] <SEP> even though i see kickstarter, don't know why they purchased one.  like is it kickstarter.art xD
[23:14:22] <fnk> maybe they want to kickstart kickstarter for art
[23:14:25] <fnk> (only)
[23:14:47] <fnk> sadly, that wouldn't surprise me
[23:16:38] <SEP> I really hope that isn't the case.  Since the only "art" on that website tends to be related to great misfortune
[23:17:09] <SEP> unless vidya games; for whatever reason, there's still less than a 50% success rate and yet people still fund them
