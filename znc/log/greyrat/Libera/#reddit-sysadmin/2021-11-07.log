[03:44:17] <mistiry> SpeakerToMeat: honestly, any good sysadmin would balk at "web based administration interface". 
[03:45:11] <mistiry> the better way to manage those services would be with configuration management. ansible, puppet, etc.
[03:45:41] <sd_> 11<H​otmess> yup
[03:45:54] <fritzwastaken> mistiry: still waiting on word back on that. They offered my first week to be in cali, but I cant afford that shit right now
[03:46:08] <fritzwastaken> If they get me a ticket and a room im there
[03:46:46] <mistiry> id just be honest with them. having been out of work for X time, it would be extremely difficult to try to travel, especially somewhere like cali where its $$$
[03:47:26] <fritzwastaken> Hey (Boss) I have no local obligations for the first few weeks. I would not be able to cover the charges, but if (Employer) wanted to and covered the costs of me flying out and staying near the California office for week 1 or 2 I would be there without a problem.  My wife and cats can fend for themselves for a little bit.
[03:47:58] <fritzwastaken> they were gunna fly a cali guy out here for my first week anyways

[12:39:39] <Cl0udNinja> true. I played for a good while, but I just hated that if you fucked up how far back you had to start sometimes because saves werent a thing
[12:41:47] <Activ8> there's some great games to play though on emulators
[12:43:15] <Cl0udNinja> my monkey brain cant handle a lot of them anymore. controls frustrate me, etc. lol
[12:45:56] <Activ8> really
[12:46:42] <Cl0udNinja> yeah, idk why. I play complex gameswith complex controls without a problem but like, original nintendo games frustrate the fuck out of me because lack of controls and shit lol
[12:47:12] <Cl0udNinja> and worse, I grew up with those original nintendo games
[12:48:17] <Activ8> there's not a lot you can do on old games though compared to now
[12:49:45] <Cl0udNinja> depends on the game
[12:50:52] <Cl0udNinja> I still play a few old games relatively frequently, but all are from after 99/2000.
[12:51:02] <Activ8> yeh
[12:52:18] <Cl0udNinja> damn.... I cant believe this game is actually that old..

[13:00:47] <sd_> 13<C​olour> Like, they actually brake for you, and turn for you

[13:01:14] <Cl0udNinja> right
[13:01:23] <sd_> 13<C​olour> Imagine a shooting game that also aimed for you and reloaded for you
[13:01:29] <Cl0udNinja> but also with games getting more realistic you have to appeal to all player skills
[13:01:35] <Cl0udNinja> ... 
[13:01:41] <Cl0udNinja> do you not remember 'aim assist' in games?
[13:01:48] <sd_> 13<C​olour> No I mean actually outright aiming
[13:01:52] <Cl0udNinja> .. 
[13:01:54] <Cl0udNinja> see: doom

[13:02:18] <Activ8> mhm
[13:02:34] <sd_> 13<C​olour> Imagine if aimbot was a normal game mechanic
[13:02:39] <Activ8> that's no different to when you could have a handicap in games either
[13:03:00] <Activ8> football games had it, pool, snooker games had it as well
[13:03:04] <Cl0udNinja> yeah
[13:03:21] <sd_> 13<C​olour> Also the original doom didn't aim for you, I know it went up and down but that's because the game was actually 2d
[13:03:23] <Activ8> I think monopoly had it as well at one point
[13:04:01] <Cl0udNinja> Colour but as long as you were 'in the vicinity' it could still shift your cursor onto the person
[13:04:18] <sd_> 13<C​olour> I don't remember that but it's been a long time I guess
[13:04:25] <Cl0udNinja> and games like Half-Life also had aim assist that would drastically move the cursor as long as you generally aimed near an enemy
[13:04:26] <Activ8> i might play on abe's odyssey today, cracking platform game that was
[13:04:37] <sd_> 13<C​olour> Oddworld is great ye
[13:04:56] <sd_> 13<C​olour> Oh yeah Half Life had a weird insane aim assist but that wasn't normal
[13:06:21] <Cl0udNinja> either way, my point is that it goes toward making sure that many skill levels can enjoy the game
[13:06:28] <sd_> 13<C​olour> I feel like all these assist things, while making games accessible, also stop people learning how to play
[13:06:46] <Cl0udNinja> like, you would get a lot of people not playing a racing game if it was a manual shifting game only
[13:06:58] <Cl0udNinja> also very true
[13:07:09] <sd_> 13<C​olour> Yeah but having automatic and manual was the only assist option and it's not really a bad one to have
[13:07:09] <Cl0udNinja> one of the reasons I like the games I play, as they arent forgiving toward that
[13:07:14] <sd_> 13<C​olour> I felt like automatic was the easy mode
[13:07:24] <Cl0udNinja> Squad is a great example, so much shit matters in that game
[13:07:51] <Cl0udNinja> run too long and try to aim? wont hit shit. try and full auto a whole clip? good luck keeping your mouse on the pad, try bein rambo after gettin shot?die instantly
[13:08:14] <sd_> 13<C​olour> My friend couldn't beat another friend at mario kart at all and I felt like he both relied on, and was being hurt by, assist.
[13:08:15] <sd_> 13<C​olour> 
[13:08:15] <sd_> 13<C​olour> Because he never played without assist he couldn't play if he turned it off.
[13:08:15] <sd_> 13<C​olour> 
[13:08:15] <sd_> 13<C​olour> But because he had it on, he could never win.

[13:55:05] <sd_> 13<C​olour> But they didn't leave behind documentation

[13:57:16] <Activ8> an IT company that isn't big on documentation is NOT an IT company.  Without it you leave other people very vulnerable to issues.
[13:58:08] <Activ8> There's two companies I have been in that didn't even have a service desk OR documentation and I it a priority to get them up and running.  That alone was worth my cost in wages
[14:01:37] <Seto_Kaiba> it does depend though

[14:01:43] *** Hunterkl is now known as Hunterkll
[14:01:59] <Hunterkll> 95% of my documentation is "here's the technet link showing the steps i did"
[14:02:17] <Activ8> problem with that is if the site ever removes content there is no documentation
[14:02:20] <Activ8> IMO
[14:02:40] <Hunterkll> sure, but in that case, you're using an unsupported product then RIP the product 
[14:02:44] <Activ8> I have done documentation like that before to find the sites been removed a year later
[14:02:55] <Activ8> there is that indeed

[14:27:19] <Activ8> imo

[23:22:27] <Cl0udNinja> 'get'
[23:22:37] <rpifan> but at least a recognition that not just due to bad habits but also medical reasons
[23:22:49] <rpifan> i cant really get up until noon but i can strecth and maybe do 10am
[23:22:50] <Cl0udNinja> did you read the story about the guy having to prove to his insurance company that fingers were not a luxury item?
[23:22:53] <fritzwastaken> how do they diagnose that? sleep studies?
[23:22:58] <rpifan> yea
