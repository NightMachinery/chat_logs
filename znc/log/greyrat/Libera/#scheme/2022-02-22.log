[21:29:23] <jcowan> tokie: other approaches to multiple values, not as efficient, are to use a record or similar object and to use a list whose car is a unique object like (list 'multiple-values).  These work because it is an error to return multiple values to a continuation that doesn't expect them (as opposed to CL where all values but the first are ignored).
[21:29:41] <tokie> jcowan: yeah, that's the scheme impl i've seen
[21:32:35] <jcowan> Part of the problem is that while multiple arguments are statically apparent, multiple values aren't.  IMO it would have been better to extend lambda instead: (multiple-lambda (a b c) (x y z) . body), where a b c are bound to the arguments and x y z are bound but have no value.  Then you use set! or perhaps some other special form to give them values.  Too late now.  (Of course this generalizes to improper lists too).
[21:34:53] <gwatt> are x y z supposed to represent return arity?
[21:38:09] <Zipheir> jcowan: In short, types for procedures.
[21:39:57] <jcowan> Only in the sense that (lambda (x y z) ...) is a type.

[21:40:25] <jcowan> gwatt: Yes, but they are also names for variables you can set and otherwise manipulate.
[21:40:28] <tokie> jcowan: yeah, that's a lot of where my confusion is
[21:41:45] <Zipheir> jcowan: Yes, but you're specifically talking letting the complier use this information to efficiently implement multiple values, so this is a kind of type.
[21:41:52] <Zipheir> s/complier/compiler/
[21:42:02] <Zipheir> (They are rarely identical.)
[21:43:18] <jcowan> By the same token, proper lambda-lists let the compiler efficiently implement multiple arguments (as opposed to Perl, where a procedure gets an array of its arguments and then has to check for correctness)
[21:43:44] <jcowan> The duality of arguments and results goes very deep.
[21:43:51] <LeoNerd> *ahem* Well, old perl. New perl has proper signatures
[21:47:38] <gwatt> Does it work better than the experimental arity hints did? I seem to remember problems when trying to call an arity-annotated with a @array argument

[22:08:40] <Zipheir> jcowan: I seem to remember a discussion here or on #chicken of describing a standard form for type signatures in Scheme.  I think that would give you a way to specify the needed coarity info.
[22:11:15] <jcowan> I meant to type "Perl4"
[22:12:10] <jcowan> The thing is that what I am talking about declares local variables; it's not *just* a type declaration, for the same reason that an ordinary lambda-list is not.
[22:13:11] <Zipheir> I get it.  I'm just thinking of different ways.

[22:56:51] <dpk> there's no reason returning up to as many arguments as your calling convention has argument registers should be ‚Äòslow‚Äô. returning more may require a heap allocation, but even on x86, that's potentially up to four values
