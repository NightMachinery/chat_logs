[02:00:03] <Khepra> xx: CVEs needn't be release critical. which ones did you have in mind?
[02:00:31] <xx> Khepra: take your pick https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/source-package/chromium
[02:00:54] <xx> if it was up to me, bullseye would not be allowed to be released with known CVEs unfixed
[02:01:30] <ajak> you know anyone can request a CVE, right? doesn't even have to be a real vulnerability
[02:02:13] <xx> ajak: those ones are real though
[02:02:27] <sney> technically, anyone can make a bug RC, by changing the bug severity. but this close to the planned release, you would probably get better results talking directly to the release team, send email to debian-release@lists.debian.org

[02:03:24] <sney> it would help if you pick a few specific CVEs so it's clear you have security concerns, rather than just objecting to the quantity 
[02:03:45] <Khepra> xx: I agree with you, but then it'd never release :)
[02:04:26] <Khepra> chromium is a story of its own tho. canonical ditched it in favor of the snap for a reason.
[02:04:39] <sney> and the issues with chromium packaging are *well* known as has been discussed here many times (don't remember if you've been here for any of those, but it's well tread) and there is very likely already a specific compromise in place. 
[02:04:57] <xx> what's the compromise?
[02:05:00] <Khepra> the snap
[02:05:05] <xx> snap on debian?
[02:05:07] <Khepra> you get always latest. 
[02:05:18] <Khepra> yes.    apt install snapd ; snap isntall chromium ; echo "thanks, khepra!"
[02:05:23] <sney> "very likely" means I don't know what it is, but because it's a known issue that has been discussed, chances are good ...

[02:06:00] <Khepra> I'm not joking. unfortunately, but snaps are very useful in situations like these where a certain pacakge is very difficult to maintain, always lags and is a security swiss cheese.
[02:06:02] <sney> anyway: #debian is mostly professional guessers. talk to the release team if you want real answers. :) 
[02:06:06] <xx> I'd much rather chromium be removed, so that users don't accidentally `sudo apt install chromium`
[02:06:36] <Khepra> agreed. or do what ubuntu did, .deb is just a "virtual" that installs the snap
[02:07:38] <Khepra> sney: these however are real answers. it's been documented by canonical and later mint ditched the snap in favor of repackaging deb, drama ensued, debian never joined the effort, atlas shru.... uhhh, wrong context.  the penguin shrugged, world keeps turning.
[02:08:14] <hafat> Khepra, dpkg: warning: 'ldconfig' not found in PATH variable or not an executable

[02:08:16] <dpkg> hafat: That isn't enough detail, post the whole output to a pastebin (/msg dpkg pastebin).
[02:08:17] <Khepra> the bottom line, chromium .deb sucks hairy donkey tails. if you want latest, patched chromium, use the snap. 
[02:08:33] <Khepra> hafat: what are you trying to do exactly?
[02:08:42] <Khepra> dpkg: shush
[02:08:42] <dpkg> Fine, I'll shut up.
[02:09:12] <hafat> discord install
[02:09:19] <Khepra> hafat: how are you installing it
[02:09:31] <sney> "use the snap" is a real answer for a practical solution to use chromium right now. but this discussion began with a question about changing what debian is doing officially for bullseye, which is a matter for the release team. 
[02:09:46] <Khepra> indeed
[02:10:58] <hafat> Khepra, I download the installation file with the deb extension from the Discord site. Then I try to install dpkg -i discord.deb from the terminal.
[02:11:19] <Khepra> hafat: is the .deb actually built for debian?
[02:11:36] <Khepra> hafat: or do yourself a favour and:     apt install snapd; snap install Discord
[02:12:47] <sney> the snap for discord is the way to go, particularly since bullseye doesn't have a dependency for current discord, so that'll hit you once you upgrade 
[02:13:31] <sney> (libappindicator, which is deprecated, and we are waiting for discord to get their act together and switch to an indicator library that is actually maintained) 
[02:14:33] <ede> .deb sometimes is just a bloated .tgz, i've seen some not delivering much more than an install script, .desktop file and some docs.

[03:45:35] <coyotes4ys> input/output error when i go to phone directory and ls
[03:47:26] <coyotes4ys> sney said to put 'mount' and see if it shows up, somiaj

[03:50:34] <PMT> jmtpfs has debug flags you could pass it to see if it tells you why it's upset. you could also try the other suggestion of using gvfs-backends.
[03:50:46] <coyotes4ys> pass?
[03:54:32] <PMT> Yes. You could, after closing the one you already started, run jmtpfs -d [...] (note that this implies -f, which means it won't go running in the background, but will instead stay running in the terminal you run it in.), and see if it says anything useful when you go in and try ls.

[16:54:28] <n4dir>   the major problem (probably ) is, to get the dependencies already installed.

[16:57:42] <Khepra> acebrianjuan: yes, but n4dir's remark still stands: figuring out deps among already existing packages
[16:57:48] <n4dir> well, if not confused: to run dpkg -i * i /var/cache/apt/archives; you want to make sure it has only the *deb files you want to install 
[16:58:16] <n4dir> just as a "warning", make sure what you find if you use *

[16:58:59] <Khepra> acebrianjuan: also all this sounds like terrible.... grind.... shipping packages by sneakernet. are you sure you can't setup your network in such a way that the isolated machine can use an apt cacher / proxy ?
[17:00:19] <n4dir> i had to do such once or twice, and it sure was not much fun. You always miss something, go back and forth. So if possible, yes, i fully agree with that 
[17:01:02] <pflanze> What's the best (convenient, relatively simple) way to observe processes (their memory usage) over time?
[17:01:48] <Khepra> ,i procpath
[17:01:49] <judd> No package named 'procpath' was found in buster/amd64.
[17:02:06] <pflanze> I have a case of the xfdesktop process eating up all the memory at some point (and some other processes, too) and need to find out how it's related to usage.
[17:02:56] <pflanze> I know I can use top or ps and log to a file, or use /proc myself, but it'll take me hours to get to a solution that works well and lets me analyze such things nicely.
[17:03:09] *** Joins: Enissay (~Enissay@user/enissay)
[17:03:10] <Khepra> pflanze: in that case I'd recommend full system monitoring, like with munin or graphite+grafana or zabbix maybe
[17:03:43] <Khepra> it's usually when you collect the whole picture like that, you can see certain correlations and possible causes you'd miss if you isolated only one or few metrics.
[17:03:51] <pflanze> Yes
[17:04:13] <pflanze> Looking into those, thanks

[17:04:22] <Khepra> in that, munin methinks is the simplest one. a 5 minute cron job that runs localhost node with a bunch of metrics that are automatically installed based on available devices, features, functions
[17:04:23] <acebrianjuan> Khepra: I have no direct control over that machine so I don't know atm if some form of proxy is allowed
[17:05:23] <acebrianjuan> Judging by your comments, re-installing an already installed package would be undesirable, correct?
[17:06:23] <Khepra> no, that doesn't matter. the problem is figuring out which packages you need to ship, because the machine you're collecting packages on, may already have something installed, that your target machine doesn't, and you don't see that in the --download-only lists
[17:06:27] <n4dir> the web-page you linked to included some info about apt-rdpends (and such). You will find a solution of that kind. A bit over my head, as i hardly do it, acebrianjuan 
[17:07:01] <n4dir> also apt-cache show <pkg> has the dependencies listed. You'd need some "awk" or similar tool to get it sorted. Again: above me
[17:07:31] <Khepra> I can't imagine a security environment in which you can't set up a carefuly configured, subnet decoupled proxy. you alerady DO have an air-gap bursting vector: shipping software across the gap, so that argument is out of the picture, for not setting up network.
[17:08:26] <Khepra> on the other hand, if that's air gapped, do you even need to upgrade, once you've set it up? if that machine processes untrusted data and has to be patched, you've already broken the gap again, so a proxy is again very much feasible.
[17:09:51] <acebrianjuan> understood guys
[17:10:40] <acebrianjuan> I can try downloading all the packages on a VM with a fresh Debian image
[17:10:48] *** Joins: p0indexter (~alpha@user/p0indexter)
[17:11:01] <acebrianjuan> that will probably pull absolutely all the dependencies
[17:12:17] <Khepra> acebrianjuan: if the air-gapped machine is installed from the same VM/iso template, with same options,   that's not unreasonable assumption
[17:13:45] <Khepra> you can also debootstrap a chroot, that's as minimal as it gets; apt-get (!) install all the packase there and copy over /var/cache/apt/archives/
[17:14:30] <n4dir> they will be there in the same path, so just copy them to your USB stick (no?)
[17:14:35] <Khepra> however, not it's not just the packages. you need the entire index database if you want  "apt upgrade" to figure out automatically what's for update. I'm not sure what all those files are
[17:15:23] <Khepra> or else you'd need to manually resolve upgrades by noting which packages upgraded in the chroot/VM, and the forcing apt install of those on the air-gapped machine.
[17:15:37] <Khepra> ...... or just set up apt cacher / proxy thingy :)
[17:16:34] <n4dir> acebrianjuan: is that a one time  experience, or you will have to install packages offline often?
[17:18:25] *** Quits: hafat (~hafat@95.70.167.173) (Quit: Leaving)
[17:19:17] <acebrianjuan> n4dir: one time experience I suppose, once it's done it should stay like that for an extended period of time
[17:20:31] <n4dir> ok, then in my humble opinion, if what Khepra proposes is not possible, you should be fine

[17:23:17] <acebrianjuan> *again
[17:23:34] <Khepra> acebrianjuan: then just use the DVD?
[17:24:04] <n4dir> that was my thought too, but if it is only once. Not too sure if better
[17:24:04] <Khepra> download the DVDs, install what you want for "one time installation", and leave it like that
[17:24:31] <Khepra> well if that's one time installation with no subsequent upgrades, then why not. fastest, easiest way is to use the DVDs
[17:25:58] *** Quits: Ypszilon (~Ypszilon@user/ypszilon) (Quit: Byez)
[17:26:07] <acebrianjuan> the DVD approach would require formatting the machine, which I must not do
[17:26:36] <Khepra> acebrianjuan: or not. it carries the .deb files which you can shove into /var/cache/apt/archives   (methinks) and then apt-get install <package> you want, any time.
[17:26:40] <n4dir> i think and am rather sure you can add the DVD's to /etc/apt/sources.list after the original installation
[17:26:50] <Khepra> oh and that too, yes. I forgot about that.

[18:17:24] <Khepra> check again when the sid thaws, maybe someone wants to en-deb it
[18:17:56] <shtrb> Khepra, I think audicity might have also go against long established procedures in debian (like not spying on users and uploading stuff to the cloud without permit)
