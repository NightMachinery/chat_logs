[02:28:34] <ThePendulum> pretty telling a game from 2013 is still the best football game for mobile
[02:29:06] <ThePendulum> all the next editions were stripped down micro transaction crap
[02:29:25] <ThePendulum> and other developers don't even come close to the graphics and mechanics of FIFA
[02:30:00] <ThePendulum> I thought it stopped working for years, I'm so glad I gave it one more try and found out people got it working again 
[02:33:30] <ThePendulum> the best alternative I came across was a dodgy Chinese game with different names for the players to avoid licensing, like Ruban vin Parsia
[02:41:38] <skye0> Gonna make a midnight snack, play The Sims 4 and get drunk
[02:42:24] <skye0> I want to play Apex Legends TDM but it won't come out for a good while. Even if it does the game reminds me of my gender issues :(
[02:42:39] <skye0> listening to someone livestream it.
[02:58:03] <ThePendulum> sims 4 is good
[02:58:07] <ThePendulum> skye0: do you have any mods?
[02:58:43] <skye0> yup but i don't go crazy with them in case an update brakes them
[02:58:53] <skye0> thank fuck i can cross dress without modding anyway
[02:58:58] <skye0> only reason i prefer it above the sims 2
[02:59:09] <ThePendulum> yeah I was gonna say at least you can make anyone walk talk and dress however you want
[02:59:16] <skye0> yup
[02:59:45] <skye0> but i've been burned out from it recently.
[03:00:30] <ThePendulum> I always dress everyone up nicely for a big cocaine fueled orgy, but by the time I'm done no one wants to talk to each other and I forgot the cheats to make them
[03:00:58] <ThePendulum> and I just end up building nice houses
[03:02:13] <joepie91> sims 3 > sims 4 tbh
[03:02:25] <joepie91> sims 4 time management is completely fucked

[03:03:01] <ThePendulum> time management in what sense? I basically got everything on full sandbox so I hardly get much of the original mechanics
[03:03:13] <skye0> sims 3 just seemed a bit more forgettable to me. slightly fewer features than the sims 2, the soundtrack wasn't my taste
[03:03:17] <ThePendulum> I do wish they put their breakfast bowls in the sink instead of on the garage floor
[03:03:18] <joepie91> on the regular clock, days in sims 4 are too short
[03:03:24] <skye0> i disable free will for sims, disable automatic aging
[03:03:34] <joepie91> and it becomes a stressful "get stuff done in time" thing
[03:03:36] *** Quits: analognoise (~analognoi@185.229.59.36) (Quit: Leaving)
[03:03:44] <joepie91> presumably that's moddable but I've never gotten that to actually work
[03:03:49] <ThePendulum> ah yeah the aging thing nipped me in the bum before, although it can be undone with a modded CAS manager afaik
[03:04:01] <ThePendulum> right yeah the days can get in the way a bit especially when managing multiple sleep cycles
[03:04:06] <ThePendulum> I always got one fucker awake at 6am
[03:04:11] <skye0> i'm kind of used to the pace but the sims 4 is the longest sims i've played
[03:04:40] <skye0> playing the game with 6+ sims does get challenging but i like playing with at least that number because of the characters i've created or imported
[03:05:52] *** Quits: kariosfox (~kariosfox@89.229.175.242) (Remote host closed the connection)
[03:06:01] <joepie91> also something I've noticed, it feels like the later the Sims game, the more quirkiness gets lost
[03:07:01] <skye0> the sims 4 has gone on for quite long though, EA are trying to milk the most of what they can from the whole live service deal
[03:07:16] <skye0> it's sadly one of the few games i want to play though to make the most of my spare time
[03:07:19] <ThePendulum> hm yeah I'm only really on the Sims 4 because the character editor is the most detailed and elaborate, and so is the custom content
[03:07:20] *** Joins: Guest60 (~Guest60@75.119.239.57)
[03:07:34] <ThePendulum> god yeah they have like a hundred DLCs for it at €20 each or something
[03:07:56] <skye0> most other games the customization is horribly gender locked. i avoid some games, even those that are for free, out of dysphoria, like fucking apex legends
[03:08:09] <skye0> only like it because it's a shooter. don't like it because it's a battle royale and because it reminds me of why i hate being a guy
[03:11:42] <joepie91> a hundred expansion packs has been the business model from day one though :p
[03:12:12] <ThePendulum> true but never so frivolous and expensive
[03:12:19] <ThePendulum> was it the sims 4 that didn't have dishwashers in the base game at first
[03:13:26] <joepie91> the expansion packs for The Sims 1 weren't cheap either though
[03:13:46] <joepie91> though yeah, the 'content distribution' was definitely better
[03:13:56] <joepie91> the expansion packs where basically themed extensions
[03:13:58] <ThePendulum> maybe what changes is that I wouldn't even consider buying a game before the time the Sims 4 came out
[03:14:01] <joepie91> not 'missing content'
[03:14:06] <ThePendulum> *changed
[03:14:09] <joepie91> s/where/were/
[03:15:07] <ThePendulum> I dread to think what GTA 6's business model is going to look like
[03:15:23] <ThePendulum> I hope there's at least some kind of redeemable story mode

[03:29:42] <skye0> cities skylines is approaching sims 4 levels of expansion packs though
[03:30:23] <skye0> gta v's story i couldn't stand. loved the mechanics though, gta v and online. couldn't stand the grind though
[03:30:24] <skye0> spent more money on mtx in planetside 2, gta online was the second most i spent on mtx
[03:30:37] <skye0> gta iv's character dynamic felt a bit more wholesome with friends
[03:39:56] <joepie91> cities skylines feels extremely car-centric in its design unfortunately
[03:40:07] <joepie91> like public transport and bikes and whatnot are an afterthought
[03:46:28] <skye0> mmhm
[03:47:11] <skye0> it is kind of a luxury though for at least modern cities outside of europe I think (no thanks to colonialism) to design around pedestrians and a robust public transport system rather than the car
[03:47:30] <skye0> the game turns into traffic management simulator and you're forced to install mods just to make it bearable

[03:55:14] <rawktucc> skye0, i disagree
[03:55:19] <rawktucc> it should be a REQUIREMENT to build like that
[03:55:24] <rawktucc> around people and public transport
[03:55:33] <rawktucc> it's a LUXURY and specifically a wasteful luxury to design around cars
[03:58:35] <skye0> what i'm trying to say is that pedestrian and public transport centred design is almost an afterthought
[03:58:42] <skye0> as if people are either cutting costs, but if not, they're merely giving in to auto lobbyists
[03:59:02] <ThePendulum> hm yeah the folks at cities skylines should have watched some Not Just Bikes
[04:00:23] <rawktucc> 1000000% ^
[04:00:32] <rawktucc> skye0, it's not even about cutting costs
[04:00:46] <rawktucc> designing a city around people and public transit would probably cost LESS because you have less to implement that cars required
[04:00:52] <rawktucc> wide lanes, signs, lights, etc
[04:00:57] <rawktucc> fuck stroads
[04:01:10] <skye0> yeah, maybe they gave in to auto lobbying or something
[04:01:21] <skye0> glad i got booze
[04:01:51] <rawktucc> they definitely did
[04:02:06] <rawktucc> where i am we had street cars in the 50s or 60s, like until then
[04:02:14] <rawktucc> GM came in and something happened and they were gone
[04:02:20] <joepie91> skye0: honestly, lacking transit/biking infrastructure in many countries is a reason *to* feature it more prominently in cities skylines, IMO
[04:02:40] <rawktucc> honestly the lack of proper public people infrsatructure, and public transit, is entirely why im planning to leave canada tbh
[04:02:47] <rawktucc> i'm just stressing a bit about tourist visa shit
[04:03:02] <skye0> in the philippines we have jeepneys - basically multi-person taxis converted from WWII jeeps
[04:03:02] <rawktucc> it's stupid and complicated, there's loopholes I have beyond 90 days in the schengen area but it's annoying
[04:03:16] <rawktucc> it's almost as if capitalism has been the root cause of anti-people progress
[04:03:19] <joepie91> like, as mentioned, right now the game basically turns into Traffic Jam Simulator beyond a certain point and you don't have any effective ways to deal with that because even if you build a transit-and-biking-oriented city (with the meagre offering of road pieces available for that), the game will still inject cars fucking everywhere
[04:03:28] <skye0> rawktucc the UK is warmer. it seems to want to be like the US without the religiosity though
[04:03:32] <skye0> yup
[04:03:33] <rawktucc> the UK is worse
[04:03:40] <rawktucc> horribly anti privacy
[04:03:44] <skye0> yup
[04:03:45] <rawktucc> authoritarian in my opinion
[04:03:52] <skye0> fuck this country, i want out
[04:03:54] <rawktucc> you'd better hope scotland cuts itself off tbh
[04:03:59] <skye0> yup
[04:04:02] <skye0> doesn't like the internet
[04:04:06] <rawktucc> luckily the UK is not part of the schengen area so I'll probably start travel there
[04:04:10] <skye0> the country can go burn
[04:04:21] <rawktucc> it will
[04:04:23] <rawktucc> we all will
[04:04:28] <rawktucc> climate change is here and it's coming really fast
[04:04:36] <rawktucc> the methane feedback loops are happening already. we're truly fucked
[04:04:51] <skye0> want to go to canada just because it's a better UK - more liberal and less obsessed with being classy
[04:04:54] <rawktucc> it'll be a slow decline but we're gonna see shit hit the fan far sooner than 2050 or whatever stupid timeline they want
[04:05:02] <rawktucc> skye0, would not agree it's more liberal
[04:05:13] <rawktucc> we're going in the same direction. authoritarian or dictatorship
[04:05:41] <rawktucc> I mean we have equally bad internet bills here. they're labelled as anti-harassment but really they're so that people can be basically fucking bankrupt if you try to speak ill of the government
[04:05:55] <rawktucc> there's also one about canadian content which would basically kill foreign content providers having content in canada
[04:06:08] <skye0> you're near the US, may not surprise me too much, but here in the UK, they complain about wokeness. unfortunately they can't see immediately how the republican US has fucked them over
[04:06:21] <skye0> i'm out of options. europe's nice politically but i feel i don't fit in europe
[04:06:29] <rawktucc> force your way in
[04:06:33] <rawktucc> at least you have an easier in
[04:07:02] <rawktucc> I can apply for a specific EU passport based on family history but I might have to give up canadian passport for that, for one, and two they might deny the application. portugal's 1 year nomad visa looks kinda promising though and it's cheap
[04:07:11] <rawktucc> but then I'd have to learn portuguese and you need a place to stay or something
[04:07:46] <rawktucc> canada is a monopolistic country too. limited choices in many places, for cell phone, internet, tv, etc.
[04:07:46] <skye0> i wanted to go to sweden. language isn't too hard
[04:08:00] <rawktucc> sweden is bad privacy wise too apparently. public databases of everyone in sweden are online to search
[04:08:02] <skye0> culturally i don't feel like i would fit in anywhere except either the US or canada (liberal parts, mind you)
[04:08:13] <rawktucc> https://action.openmedia.org/page/97956/action/1?
[04:08:23] <skye0> maybe the czech republic? most liberal slav country out there
[04:08:34] <rawktucc> yeah but czech is a difficult language
[04:08:42] <rawktucc> i would consider them conservative tbh
[04:08:45] <skye0> also considered the netherlands
[04:08:53] <rawktucc> the netherlands would be pretty liberal
[04:08:57] <skye0> i tried learning russian. gave up only because i couldn't find anyone i wanted to talk to
[04:09:20] <ThePendulum> hm I feel there's a difference between disregarding the concern for privacy and having a different concept of private information
[04:09:31] <rawktucc> sorry yeah. i was a bit too focused there
[04:09:36] <skye0> honestly canada and the US are the only places (liberal areas) i feel like i could live in because culturally i'd feel better able to relate to them. culturally there's almost nothing i like from europe except like winx club, that's about it.
[04:09:45] <rawktucc> im just fed up in general with the design of north american cities, I really like europe's general design
[04:09:59] <ThePendulum> I think a lot of Scandinavian's think it's obvious you can look up what everyone else earns
[04:10:34] <rawktucc> https://teddit.net/r/privacy/comments/sphx78/privacy_does_not_exist_in_sweden/
[04:11:25] <rawktucc> i hate driving
[04:11:29] <ThePendulum> "it even tells you what breed their dog is
[04:11:30] <rawktucc> i love taking trains and buses and biking
[04:11:38] <rawktucc> and unfortunately north america is not built for that
[04:11:43] <rawktucc> amtrak is a joke, viarail is barebones
[04:11:47] <ThePendulum> okay maybe that's a bit too wide open
[04:11:47] <rawktucc> both are expensive
[04:12:13] <skye0> ThePendulum my brother wanted to move to Denmark because the people seemed more humble
[04:12:38] <ThePendulum> but?
[04:12:46] <skye0> if I didn't care about the fact I would never fit in culturally with basically all of Europe (even in more liberal areas), I'd move to any western European country I wanted
[04:12:51] <rawktucc> skye0, I know someone moving to denmark. kinda envious
[04:12:59] <rawktucc> they're moving to live with their partner and work there
[04:13:10] <ThePendulum> there's a lot hiding behind the smile of a dane https://static.turbosquid.com/Preview/2019/01/02__07_21_36/0.png76456DDD-09DE-4C97-99E3-94CD3B137CB3Large.jpg
[04:13:11] <rawktucc> denmark seems to have a lot good going for it, and good agreements with canada
[04:13:21] <rawktucc> ThePendulum, hahahaha
[04:13:36] <skye0> but as I mentioned one of the only things I practically have in common with Europeans culturally is Winx Club. Pretty much nothing else beyond that.
[04:13:58] <skye0> this apex legends stream is making me depressed. the death of titanfall and me wanting something like call of duty more so too
[04:14:04] <ThePendulum> that was probably the main motivator of brexit
[04:14:11] <rawktucc> lego?
[04:14:18] <rawktucc> did boris honson step on a lego 4x4
[04:14:27] <skye0> i want to avoid call of duty for its stupid release schedule and rapist protecting companies activision and blizzard. i'm finding halo infinite boring because they'll never make new maps
[04:15:06] <ThePendulum> no the british tallying up everything and realizing the only thing Europe ever brought them was Winx club
[04:15:29] <ThePendulum> WINX! PAK ELKAAR MAAR BIJ DE HAND! PROBEER DE KRACHT TE VOELEN! DE KRACHT VAN DE NATUUR! OH WINX CLUB!
[04:15:41] <rawktucc> are you saying winx club was originally dutch?
[04:15:44] <skye0> motivator of brexit? yeah, i think the refugee crisis made britain want to nope out of the whole thing, combined with the fact they probably didn't want to keep dealing with more polish people like Grzegorz Brzęczyszczykiewicz from Chrząszczyżewoszyce, district Łękołody
[04:15:45] <ThePendulum> sorry I hadn't heard that tune in like a decade and I wanted to make sure it come out all at once like a good log
[04:15:45] <rawktucc> and the version i watched was dubbed?
[04:15:58] <skye0> winx club was italian
[04:15:58] <ThePendulum> it's Italian I  think
[04:16:01] <ThePendulum> yeah

[04:16:45] <skye0> the english dubs of winx club are strange and have never consistently made it through the entire series because of either a lack of interest in magical girl shows in english speaking countries or cartoon network and similar countries denying them air time
[04:16:47] <skye0> like nickelodeon, when they had rights to winx club, aired them here at really inconvenient times here in the UK
[04:17:44] <ThePendulum> I've only witnessed the Dutch dub from when my sister was watching it
[04:17:46] <skye0> winx club is on the 9th season and soft rebooting
[04:18:32] <joepie91> rawktucc: kids shows tend to be dubbed a lot in NL
[04:18:39] <skye0> i'm waiting for apex legends to release team deathmatch, the only game mode i'll enjoy in a first person shooter. i'm also waiting to not envy the pretty ladies in the game and not feel dysphoric playing it if i were to
[04:18:40] <rawktucc> oh ThePendulum had a dubbed version
[04:18:42] <joepie91> at least in the latter half of my childhood
[04:18:47] <ThePendulum> it arrived to the netherlands just a couple years too late for me to have intentionally watched it myself
[04:18:56] <joepie91> in the former half it was mostly syndicated Cartoon Network with subs
[04:19:06] <joepie91> and I think a combination of subbed and dubbed on Fox Kids
[04:19:34] <skye0> 4kids was famous for being hated by everyone except winx club fans in the US and Australia
[04:19:37] <ThePendulum> best I can do is playing Fairly Odd Parents and Totally Spies together, I think that might make Winx Club
[04:19:44] <joepie91> lol
[04:20:04] <joepie91> also, I remember when Cartoon Network triumphantly announced that they would start airing cartoons in Dutch
[04:20:06] <skye0> because of the lack of cultural differences, winx club did have some changes in the 4Kids club (largely for weird licensing reasons I think) but it didn't seem to matter too much
[04:20:20] <skye0> unlike those times when food in Pokemon 4Kids was Americanized
[04:20:29] <rawktucc> and they removed guns
[04:20:35] <ThePendulum> I don't remember if I watched totally spies because it was rad or because it's three girls in a latex suit and I was hitting puberty
[04:20:37] <joepie91> except only some episodes were dubbed and so the voices changed from episode to episode 🙃
[04:20:55] <joepie91> ThePendulum: it was pretty amusing in and of itself tbh :p
[04:21:03] <joepie91> I think they're on youtube

[04:27:32] <rawktucc> https://ttm.sh/ijk.585%29%20000 this is Season 1 Episode 35, where they pointed a gun at ash
[04:27:48] <rawktucc> and then episode 38 was the seizure porygon episode
[04:29:54] <ThePendulum> I didn't watch a lot of pokemon but did james get a boobjob?
[04:30:08] <rawktucc> Yes, Pokemon_Indigo_League_-_Episode 018_-_Beauty_and_the_Beach
[04:30:14] <rawktucc> i think this was considered "Season 2"
[04:30:37] <rawktucc> it was some kind of beauty bikini show and team rocket shows up
[04:30:41] <rawktucc> james just... got boobs
[04:30:52] <rawktucc> they're inflatable, as he shows that off to Misty  by making them bigger
[04:32:15] <ThePendulum> "didn't we want to sell this to the Americans?"
[04:33:29] <rawktucc> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_episodes_removed_from_rotation
[04:34:33] <ThePendulum> I think shin chan whipped his dick out a couple of times as well
[04:35:05] <rawktucc> 0-0
[04:38:40] <rawktucc> this is precisely why i datahoard
[04:40:45] <joepie91> ThePendulum: in hindsight I have *no idea* how shin chan was ever allowed to air in NL
[04:43:25] <ThePendulum> we must be absolutely traumatized
[04:43:26] <rawktucc> how are we doing tonight everyone
[04:43:39] <rawktucc> also, I think I'm gonna rent that 160TB server. i keep saying but i  think i should just do it for ease of mind
[04:44:04] <rawktucc> i dont have time or patience to implement a tape based backup system at home, and 128GB Blurays are impractical for most of this data
[04:45:59] <rawktucc> part of me still feels like i should rebuild my server on-site though
[04:46:09] <ThePendulum> joepie91: do you have any favorite office chair providers in NL?
[04:48:19] <joepie91> ThePendulum: the default recommendation is "buy a second-hand comforto"
[04:55:11] <rawktucc> i really regret not buying a pi zero 2 w when some were in stock and on sale
[04:55:25] <rawktucc> $40 CAD for power supply, usb otg , and the board
[04:55:29] <rawktucc> plus crappy shipping
[04:55:36] <rawktucc> i need a wireguard server at a family members house
[04:59:40] <Hydragyrum> I got mine just after they came out, it's pretty nice for sure
[04:59:48] <unfinity> ・゜゜・。。・゜ ​ ゜\​_ø< FLAP FL​AP!
[04:59:51] <Hydragyrum> ,bang
[04:59:51] <unfinity> Hydragyrum you shot a duck in 2.927 seconds! You have killed 22 ducks in #datahoarder.
[04:59:53] <skye0> ,bef
[04:59:53] <unfinity> You tried befriending a non-existent duck. That's freaking creepy.
[04:59:55] <skye0> :/
[05:00:27] <skye0> a bit drunk. wanted to play some more but i might be running out of energy and i'm just busy reading threads. forza horizon 5 i can at least be brain dead
[05:00:29] <Hydragyrum> regret not getting one with headers pre-soldered because I did a kinda shoddy job of it myself and not all the contacts are on quite right

[07:45:54] <skye0> I'll take a look but I'm fine with the default art style generally speaking
[07:55:55] <ThePendulum> only thing I don't like about it is that you can't apply something to all outfits, and pupils are registered as mask paint, eye lashes as glasses etc.
[07:56:24] <ThePendulum> I got boob job scars in there, lol, they don't show up very well though 
[08:08:19] <ThePendulum> so r/GoonCaves is a thing then, nsfw obviously 
[08:08:36] <ThePendulum> for people to show off their wanking setups 
[08:09:39] <ThePendulum> the kind of subreddit that helps pretend I don't have a problem because it can always get worse
