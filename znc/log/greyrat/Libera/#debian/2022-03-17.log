[02:55:46] <acu> Can anyone point me for the Debian Release Schedule ?
[02:55:51] <acu> I have few questions:
[02:57:24] <acu> 1) Are there strategic plans to synchronize Debian Stable with Ubuntu LTS (e.g. 22.04 is due in April 22) It would make a lot of sense Debian and Ubuntu to have a synchronicity
[02:57:53] <sney> debian releases are not done on a schedule, and there is no plan to sync with ubuntu
[02:58:33] <sney> historically, a new stable release is about every 2 years, and point releases are roughly quarterly
[02:58:59] <greycat> 2 to 3 years, depending on how far back you look
[02:59:00] <acu> 2) PHP 8 is becoming the default in most frameworks - PHP 7.4 security is going to be EOL this Year - I have noticed that PHP 8 needed to be installed from a private server.... is there a plan to address that ?
[02:59:43] *** Quits: LucaTM (~LucaTM@user/lucatm) (Quit: Textual IRC Client: www.textualapp.com)
[03:00:17] <acu> sney: thanks a bunch - is there are reason why debian and ubuntu LTS are totally out of sync ? It would make such a sense to share - at least on major years - both kernel and applications -
[03:00:54] <acu> I mean this makes sense from anypoint of view - at it synergise efforts

[03:01:16] <sney> debian and ubuntu have different policies. if you want to use software on ubuntu's release schedule, then you can use ubuntu. just because they share tools and some software/maintainers doesn't mean they need to line up in any other way
[03:01:20] *** beaver is now known as pong
[03:01:37] <greycat> Debian and Ubuntu don't even share the same *definition* of what "LTS" is.

[03:02:38] <greycat> As I understand it, Ubuntu marks certain releases as either "LTS" or "not LTS", and the LTS releases get more support.  Debian treats all releases the same.  Each one has a period of full support, and then a period of lesser support known as "LTS".
[03:02:54] <sney> as for php, since debian froze bullseye on 7.4, that most likely means the debian php team will keep supporting 7.4 with backported patches even if upstream does not.
[03:03:32] <acu> sney and greycat - thanks it makes sense what you are saying, but some level of cooperation and synchronicity would be tremendously beneficial - I assume - I mean - taking in consideration all the differences - it would still make sense - from time to time to align - both Ubuntu and Debian leaders are intelligent people -

[07:09:41] <ChetManly> so should we starting to use https: to download updates from the netinstall
[07:12:25] <ChetManly> I am thinking I didnt give it a proper url and that's why only had standard utilities option to download from the repo's and the installer failed (red screen)
[07:13:26] <ChetManly> @ 21:38 03/15/22
[07:13:56] <somiaj> Don't quite follow, not all debian mirrors support https, though many do these days
[07:14:31] <somiaj> what mirror did you use. It is suggested you use the cdn, http://deb.debian.org, you can use https://deb.debian.org too, but as mentioned this may limit what mirrors you have access too.
[07:16:04] <ChetManly> well I cant quite remember cause with everything in the installer there is a default option if you doing something more advanced anyway so I would have just hit enter ...

[07:18:54] <ChetManly> but I did select https: instead of regular http ... was wondering if there should be a default in there .. I usually only use debian.org but your saying that there only needs a "s" to make the difference like anything else https: ?
[07:19:28] <somiaj> In general http:// is what you want to use, though more and more mirrors support https than have in the past.

[07:22:09] <ChetManly> it was on expert install which seems funny I know but it helps me discover :-))
[07:22:58] <ChetManly> how do you regularly install ?
[07:24:54] <somiaj> Because you can upgrade in place, I don't usually install except once every couple of releases in a vm (though I don't have mnay overall installs, maybe 5-10)

[07:33:18] *** Quits: stoiclunchbox (~stoiclunc@user/stoiclunchbox) (Client Quit)
[07:33:18] <somiaj> You can't upgrade with the live/installer isos, you need to upgrade using internet sources.
[07:33:23] <somiaj> !buster->bullseye
[07:33:31] <somiaj> dpkg: buster->bullseye
[07:33:34] *** Joins: mooff (mooff@awful.cooking)
[07:33:40] <somiaj> dpkg: buster->bullseye
[07:33:40] <dpkg> Read (at least) the upgrading chapter of <release notes> https://deb.li/39cyD . TL;DR: In /etc/apt/sources.list change "buster" to "bullseye", fix the line for security updates (see <bullseye-security>), remove stable-specific lines like buster-backports. apt update && apt upgrade --no-new-pkgs && apt full-upgrade. 3rd party repos like <dmo> cause problems with upgrades. If working over ssh, upgrade ssh first, see <bullseye ssh upgrade>.
[07:34:26] <itt788> how much data will it download?
[07:34:46] <somiaj> It depends on the packages you have installed
[07:35:00] <itt788> nothing special
[07:35:26] <itt788> i have only what was in the 10.10 iso
[07:35:28] <somiaj> desktops end up taking a bit of space, but you will have to download those .deb files one way or another, so overall the upgrade often downloads less than other ways
[07:35:49] <somiaj> This is also vague, there are so many different debian .iso files, and what you select to install may vary from person to person.
[07:36:07] <somiaj> Basically you need to download a new .deb package for each one you have installed, plus you need to downlaod a few new packages to satsifies depends.
[07:36:09] <ChetManly> the deduction skills are on fleek
[07:36:35] <itt788> debian-live-10.10.0-amd64-kde+nonfree.iso 3.3GB
[07:36:53] <ChetManly> I would have never got that from one sentence
[07:38:20] <somiaj> itt788: again the answer depends, but the easiest way to upgrade from debian 10 to 11 is to follow the instructions the bot posted (read the release notes first). In terms of files to download, it should be less than downloading a new installer.
[07:38:43] <somiaj> also it means all your configurations are in place and overall debian's upgrade path is quite nice.
[07:40:27] <somiaj> itt788: note always backup. Although debian upgrades are usually smooth, this isn't always the case, there can be issues, and again issues depend on what software one uses.

[13:59:13] <jelly> neoclust, if you deleted files in /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/ directory you will have to use this when reinstalling debian-archive-keyring, as they're considered conffiles
[13:59:17] <jelly> !confmiss
[13:59:18] <dpkg> You have to especially tell the packaging system to reinstall config files because when they are gone, it is assumed that you want them to stay deleted.  "aptitude -o DPkg::Options::='--force-confmiss' reinstall $packagename" will restore them (man dpkg for details).  If the package uses <ucf> for config file management, ask me about <ucf confmiss>.

[16:08:13] <WantToHe1p> does anyone use FAI and do you recommend it
[16:08:34] <Haohmaru> !fai
[16:08:35] <dpkg> Fully Automatic Installation (FAI) is an automated tool to install or deploy Debian (and other distributions) on a bunch of different hosts or a cluster.  It is more flexible than tools like <kickstart> (Red Hat), autoyast and alice (SuSE) or jumpstart (Oracle Solaris).  FAI can also be used for configuration management of a running system.  http://fai-project.org/  #fai on irc.oftc.net.
[16:10:09] * tarzeau would like to know as well. including how long the install takes 
[16:10:48] <WantToHe1p> well i was reading and for newer systems it takes anywhere from 5-10 minutes i think
[16:11:39] <WantToHe1p> but i have a lot of computers to put debian on and i need an auto install solution
[16:12:01] <tarzeau> WantToHe1p: how many?
[16:12:29] <tarzeau> WantToHe1p: laptops or workstations? all kinds of, or one of a kind? storage? rotating platter or nvme or ssd, mixture, with more than one?
[16:13:25] <Haohmaru> "yes"
[16:13:36] <WantToHe1p> just about 10 workstations with more in the future but i want a tool like this for the future
[16:13:56] <tarzeau> we use debian installer with preseeding
[16:14:00] <jelly> you can do them in parallel so 10 minutes is not an issue
[16:14:18] <tarzeau> that's just the base install. it'll certainly take more if you install 5000 deb packages
[16:14:46] <jelly> the whole process takes 9 minutes for my VMs with about 50 extra packages
[16:14:54] <WantToHe1p> i see

[16:24:50] <Khepra> neoclust: that "couldn't execute" is really weird. do you have some weird mount option somewhere? noexec on /usr mounts? maybe you could strace(1) apt-key (strace apt-update, using -f and -o options to log into a file)

[17:33:51] <jelly> I don't know how iscsi works, but an "initiator" is basically a disk controller, something that asks disks to do things and sends and receives data from them.  A "target" is actual storage, say, a disk (or a LUN)
[17:34:00] <jelly> that's how scsi works
[17:34:27] <jelly> so "initiator" is just a fancy name for that computer itself
[17:34:35] <jelly> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCSI_initiator_and_target
[17:35:50] <raccct> Sry, to bother again with the VNC SSH issue, I managed to switch the editor, however in SSH in vi really strange characters appear in the buffer when pressing ESC and similar, like: [>4;2m - this doesn't happen in VNC
[17:36:15] <jelly> raccct, which terminal emulator are you using?
[17:36:25] <jelly> that sounds like an incorrect TERM setting
[17:36:45] <jelly> or, possibly, like you don't know how to use vi
[17:36:48] <raccct> hm, is bash a terminal emulator?
[17:37:02] <jelly> no.  bash is running inside a terminal emulator

[18:09:08] <raccct> maybe worth mentioning that it happens on root as well as the only new user I created

[18:16:23] <greycat> Also, there is no single set of packages that constitutes "Debian".  Every Debian installation is different.  You choose a set of packages during the initial install, and then you probably choose some more by hand afterward.  Whether the "full vim" is part of that initial set depends on what you chose.

[18:19:34] <greycat> Would not surprise me one iota if they gave you a fucked-up vim configuration.
[18:19:45] <Khepra> that's a bot you're talking to. cant' you see its biteable shiny ass?   vim.basic comes in when you install `vim` package
[18:19:56] <Khepra> note there's also vim-tiny package and vim-common .
[18:20:21] <greycat> I would suggest that you *create* a .vimrc file (even an empty one) in the home directory of whatever accounts you're using on that system.  That should hopefully bypass the system-wide config.
[18:20:24] <Khepra> and that's relevant for update-alternatives, the /usr/bin/vim.basic link
[18:20:53] <Khepra> greycat: they're running old vi compat mode, if there's no vim.basic and only vim.tiny is used. I am not sure running old vi compat mode is actually desired here
[18:21:50] <Khepra> in other words, yea do the test with empty .vimrc, but make sure you're running "normal" vim mode, ie. you have the "vim" package installed and /usr/bin/vim.basic link for the update-alternatives

[21:51:55] <tharkun> Good $DAY I have an HP printer that I need to install. IIRC besides cups another program needed to be install for it to properly function. Can anyone please slap me on the right direction.
[21:52:18] <tharkun> The printer is an HP-1006 laserjet.

[21:56:03] *** Quits: NOD32Admin (~Willtech@user/Willtech) (Quit: NOD32Admin)
[21:56:08] <jim> if it's an HP it probably listens on port 9100, and acts like other printers that use that port (protocolwise)
[21:56:30] *** Joins: NOD32Admin (~Willtech@user/Willtech)
[21:57:27] <jim> I don't know the exact details, but... why don't you do a google search for cups HP-1006 laserjet
[21:57:49] <jim> probably will tell you the type of printer to install for it
[21:58:21] <greycat> also, which version of Debian?  the most recent one has a bunch of changes to printing, I hear.
[21:58:41] <tharkun> jim: its connected to a usb port. And I recall having a hard time making it work on my other laptop. Googling the printer will only state post from 10 years ago of people having problems with it and not being able to solve them. So I am kind of in a tight spot therefore I asked here.
[21:58:48] <greycat> https://wiki.debian.org/CUPSDriverlessPrinting
[21:58:48] <kee> tharkun: That program shows up in aptitude when you search cups.
[21:59:43] <kee> tharkun: hplip?

[21:59:46] <shtrb> tharkun, hplip would be a good start to install
[22:00:10] <jim> tharkun, I'm just fine with you asking here... I was just thinking whatever you found out could help you set it up
[22:00:40] <jim> (I'm not chasing away -anyone-)
[22:01:16] <tharkun> greycat: I usually run stable since I learned the hardway that testing is indeed a bumpy ride.
[22:01:31] <tharkun> kee thats the one. Thanks
[22:01:42] <greycat> if it's Debian 11, and a "modern" printer (as defined by that wiki page), then it should work...
[22:01:52] <jim> yeah, and sid is worse than that
[22:02:08] <tharkun> jim: no ofense taken yet an explanation was needed.
[22:02:37] <tharkun> greycat: Yes Debian 11 but not precisely a modern printer for what I can tell.
[22:03:39] <jim> I wonder if I could get some assistance with an apt issue... (I'll do the bat thing if that's necessary):
[22:03:46] <tharkun> jim: sid has only been useful to me when I needed some "special version" of a daemon that was not yet in stable.
[22:04:01] <jim> when I do apt update or apt install anything, it gets stuck "waiting for headers"
[22:04:17] <jim> any way of finding out what's causing that and fixing?
[22:05:31] <tharkun> jim: Check which repositories your system is using. It might be that they are empty or answering your calls veeery slooowly. ;P
[22:08:04] <jim> hmm. IO'm running apt-cacher-NG
[22:08:12] <greycat> or you've got an overzealous firewall blocking HTTP, or blocking DNS...
[22:08:16] <jim> that might be the issue
[22:08:36] <jim> no, the network is fine
