[08:58:15] <companion_cube> tbh, who else would fuck tucker carlson?
[08:58:39] <manicennui> wrl: And Mrs. Potato Head probably.
[09:01:00] <manicennui> I think I might learn Elixir.
[09:02:15] <companion_cube> seems like a good match if you already like clojure
[09:02:39] <manicennui> Yeah, I'm going to collect languages that won't help me gain employment.
[09:02:54] <manicennui> And will make me more frustrated at work.
[09:03:10] <companion_cube> if you work on ruby, elixir seems like a good move?
[09:03:18] <companion_cube> I mean, I think there's _some_ elixir jobs
[09:03:30] <manicennui> Not many.
[09:03:36] <manicennui> Possibly fewer than Clojure even.
[09:04:21] <manicennui> Although a coworker recently went to weedmaps, and they use Ruby and Elixir.
[09:07:06] <indigo> Apparently Discord uses Rust
[09:07:06] <buttsbot> >When I started learning Rust in earnest in 2018, I thought this was a fluke. It is just the butterflies you get when you think you fall in love, I told myself.
[09:07:19] <manicennui> They use a few things.
[09:07:26] <manicennui> Including Erlang/Elixir.
[09:07:49] <indigo> I guess it works well for the messaging problem space
[09:08:48] <manicennui> Pretty sure one of the common XMPP implementations used Erlang.
[09:09:47] <manicennui> I saw a talk years ago about Riot using Erlang for that purpose.
[09:09:57] <manicennui> They were maintaining a custom fork.
[09:10:43] <manicennui> https://technology.riotgames.com/news/riot-messaging-service
[09:10:43] <buttsbot> Riot Messaging Service | Riot Games Technology
[09:11:02] <manicennui> This seems newer than what I saw them talk about, but also in Erlang.
[09:11:09] <companion_cube> not to forget whatsapp
[09:11:12] <manicennui> We implemented RMS entirely in Erlang, which helped us enforce proper design patterns, simplified concurrency and distribution, and let us re-use many of the existing internal libraries we built for other services like the Chat Service.
[09:13:39] <manicennui> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ejabberd
[09:13:40] <buttsbot> ejabberd - Wikipedia
[09:13:54] <manicennui> "As of 2009 ejabberd is the most popular server among smaller XMPP-powered sites that register on xmpp.org."
[09:14:14] <companion_cube> with the delicious configuration file that is a serialized erlang value
[09:14:26] <companion_cube> (well, not serialized. a literal notation of it, like json.)
[09:14:29] <manicennui> Nintendo Switch uses ejabberd in its "Nintendo Switch Push Notification infrastructure" (NPNS) handling 10 million simultaneous connections.[60]
[09:14:45] <Church> Neat
[09:15:01] <manicennui> I think this is what League of Legends used at one point.
[09:16:12] <indigo> And here I thought XMPP was dead

[09:16:20] <buttsbot> "Scaling League of Legends Chat to 70 million Players" by Michal Ptaszek - YouTube - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jsMpmWaq7I
[09:16:28] <companion_cube> it's not dead, it's just the dead source of many alive forks
[09:16:50] <manicennui> This is from 2014 when they were still using ejabberd.
[09:16:50] <companion_cube> (I think whatsapp started from ejaberd actually? not sure)
[09:17:20] <manicennui> I think they actually modified BEAM too.
[09:17:55] <companion_cube> I think it's all upstreamed? hmm
[09:18:09] <manicennui> Maybe.
[09:18:15] <manicennui> He talks about it at 20:10.
[09:27:01] <manicennui> For some reason I sleep really well after 8 or 9 AM.
[09:27:22] <manicennui> I usually get up around that time for work, but on the weekends I sometimes get up and use the bathroom and such, and then go back to bed for a couple hours, and sleep hard as fuck.

[21:49:32] <Geekingfrog> gwozniak btw, really good documentary you posted yesterday (the one about nfts)
[21:51:17] <manicennui> I was sad to see yesterday that Heavy Metal Magazine is into NFTs now and increased their annual subscription prices to ridiculous levels.
[21:58:49] <imode> in this particular economic climate, would you buy or build a house?
[22:00:01] <Geekingfrog> I would buy the nft of a house, that's a safer investment /s
[22:00:39] <imode> lmfao.
[22:02:12] <manicennui> imode: Building would be tough right now. It's supposedly pretty difficult to find contractors who are available.
[22:02:43] <imode> would it be worth securing the land, though?
[22:03:02] <manicennui> I don't know. I've thought about doing that.
[22:03:04] <imode> staring at a 200k lot.
[22:03:26] <imode> 3.5% down would be $7k.
[22:03:33] <imode> plus closing costs that's like $10k.
[22:03:42] <manicennui> I have enough cash to buy land.
[22:03:47] <imode> that plus a construction loan..
[22:03:59] <manicennui> I've thought about buying the land and then waiting a couple years to build.
[22:04:19] <imode> it wouldn't be the worst thing if you can swing it.
[22:04:29] <manicennui> But you also have to consider the cost of preparing the land.
[22:04:34] <manicennui> Which can be considerable.
[22:04:46] <imode> yeah the only thing that's running to this particular lot is electricity through the street.
[22:05:14] <manicennui> You have utilities, but also potentially clearing, grading, putting in a driveway, etc.
[22:05:20] <manicennui> Depends on how much land we are talking and where.
[22:05:21] <imode> mhm.
[22:05:43] <manicennui> I change my mind about what I want to do every week.
[22:05:59] <manicennui> I will probably continue to do so until I'm ready to actually pull the trigger.
[22:06:05] <imode> I'm going out to see it today, thankfully my father has some experience. it'd cost a bit to secure it, but the estimated monthly cost of financing wouldn't bite too much into my budget.
[22:06:16] <imode> water view, secluded area.
[22:06:22] <imode> 1.29 acres.
[22:06:27] <manicennui> Nice.
[22:06:39] <imode> no wetland either.
[22:07:08] <manicennui> In Maine?
[22:07:25] <imode> washington.
[22:08:23] <imode> assume $450k building costs and you have something pretty modest.
[22:09:13] <imode> that'd be an 1.8k sqft house at $250/sqft
[22:12:03] <manicennui> I'd really like to find something that is close to what I want, but just outdated.
[22:12:17] <manicennui> Ugly bathrooms and kitchens can be remodeled.
[22:12:23] <indigo> And here some of my coworkers are trying to buy $2M houses…
[22:12:23] <manicennui> But they often have really bad layouts too.
[22:12:44] <indigo> California is pricy
[22:12:45] <manicennui> I'm hoping to stay around $500k.
[22:13:13] <manicennui> If I build something I might go higher because I'd buy the land first and wait a couple years to build.
[22:15:07] <indigo> That’s a pretty decent price
[22:15:25] <manicennui> I've found a number of places that are close.
[22:15:32] <manicennui> The price is definitely doable.
[22:15:48] <manicennui> Just a matter of how much I'm willing to compromise on.
[22:16:11] <imode> for $500k you could buy this lot and build a decently sized house on it.

[22:16:54] <manicennui> That's at the high end.
[22:17:42] <imode> hot damn.
[22:17:51] <imode> what's the conforming loan limit for that county.
[22:17:59] <manicennui> I don't know what that means.
[22:18:34] <imode> https://www.fhfa.gov/DataTools/Downloads/Pages/Conforming-Loan-Limits.aspx
[22:18:35] <buttsbot> - 	
[22:19:27] <manicennui> I assume that it is far easier to get a loan with less down if it conforms and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac buy them?
[22:19:42] <manicennui> Also, this place is overpriced.
[22:19:55] <manicennui> You can see that they have been dropping the price and it has been on the market for 2 months.
[22:20:26] <manicennui> Also that they listed it for 4x what they bought it for 6 years ago.
[22:20:59] <manicennui> I'm sure they have made some improvements, and it has appreciated, but not that much.
[22:21:23] <manicennui> I really like the walkout basement.
