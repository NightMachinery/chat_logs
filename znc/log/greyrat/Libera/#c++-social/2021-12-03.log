[17:56:43] <hinst> indeed it does
[17:56:54] <hinst> and none of it is my fault
[17:57:07] <Faux> Had a cleanup at work, which must complete to be effective, cancelled after 48h because someone wanted to do something else.
[17:57:13] <Faux> Oh well weekend.
[18:16:53] <hinst> I drank coffee and now I feel energetiC
[18:17:30] <hinst> Calculation test crashed because java process ran out of heap memory. What is worse, there was no heap limit set, so a few other processes running on the same OS instacce crashed
[18:18:03] <T`aZ> java, what did you expect
[18:19:36] <Raziel> that can happen with C++ too, if you use up all the ram you'll get a bad_alloc and crash, but other stuff might also crash because of the ram being full for a bit
[18:22:07] <T`aZ> ofc, but the shitty low barrier entry of java introduced idiots to the programming discipline, disaster followed
[18:23:05] <Raziel> I suppose so :p although I dunno if I'd say java is that low barrier
[18:29:31] <hinst> u ppl ever heard of low-code tooling? the enterprise seem eager to invest in those
[18:30:25] <hinst> low-code & no-code. Those tools are supposed to make "programming" even more accessible
[18:30:39] <Raziel> the enterprise are eager to invest in anything that allows them to pay less for actually decent people, and for the process of finding them
[18:30:48] <Raziel> unfortunately, as it always happens, it'll just bite them in the balls
[18:33:53] <Raziel> I don't think the people pushing things like that understand that programming isn't actually about knowing how to write some weird words that compile into something that runs
[18:34:40] <Raziel> hiding the scary occult words won't make a non-programmer able to program any more than replacing a manual transmission with an automatic won't make a shit driver better
[18:37:35] <hinst> True; though if history can teach us anything, is that there were precedents... Like, people thought that the cars will never replace horses
[18:39:29] <Raziel> that's pretty different though :p and low-code or no-code things can have a place, for simple or limited things, probably.
