[17:11:10] <rwb> upsell? you mean it's not free?
[17:11:18] <rwb> namecheap always had it free for me, at least
[17:13:51] <bauruine> pushcx, but what's the benefit? I just checked my info, name, org and ch and nowhere is any personal info in whois. And i don't have whois privacy on any of the domains.
[17:14:57] <pushcx> bauruine: it varies by registry
[17:15:51] <pushcx> rwb: At some places it's free, at more places it's an upcharge. eg. name.com, $4/y
[17:17:00] <pushcx> I've always wondered about manually pasting in the 'private' contact info from a registrar's privacy service. Would they notice? You wouldn't get the email forwarding for sure. And I wonder how they'd handle in an ownership dispute.

[18:13:00] <gwozniak> iDrougge: 3 minutes is too slow? Good thing you don't work with the stuff I work with, then.
[18:13:31] <iDrougge> 3 minutes and 46 seconds, even.
[18:15:36] <gwozniak> I had to build the libraries for the toolchain yesterday to test something totally unrelated to library code because of weird historical design decisions, so what should have taken a few minutes took 2 hours
[18:16:22] <iDrougge> You could write a new compilator in that time!
[18:18:55] <gwozniak> Happily, that was only for a specific architecture.  Testing on the other architecture was much faster
[18:19:38] <gwozniak> We are having discussions at work now about how to be more comprehensive in our testing, with the caveat that it takes a long time
[18:20:31] <gwozniak> We are often in the situation where we have to develop for something that does not yet have hardware or a simulator
[18:20:59] <gwozniak> Although we can use something similar
[18:21:13] <gwozniak> Like a similar device with the same architecture
[18:22:44] <river> not even a simulator... wow
[18:22:50] <river> that's a real challenge
[18:25:01] <pushcx> along those lines, this is an interesting warning: https://twitter.com/playdate/status/1498427679707705347

[18:25:25] <gwozniak> It's always a memory configuration difference, not an instruction level difference, so it's not so bad that you won't know if the code will even be recognized
[18:25:38] <pushcx> I'm glad they have a warning, but there's no guidance on what kind of performance to expect. Which pairs unfortunately with the serious production delays they've faced.
[18:26:43] <river> what is the memory configuration? I imagine the main impact would be something like the values pointers will be
[18:26:49] <gwozniak> Hardware is significantly faster that the simulators we use
[18:27:31] <gwozniak> river: peripheral layout, device initialization, cache memories, etc.
[18:27:48] <gwozniak> Those are the things that are very hard to test without hardware
[18:27:49] <river> aj
[18:27:51] <river> ah*
[18:29:28] <gwozniak> Some devices have TCM (tightly-coupled memory) that is mapped to addresses too far from Flash, so you have to make sure that functions use the long_call attribute if they are put in instruction level TCM space, for example
[18:29:46] <mockturtle> Security for package maintainers [security] (sethmlarson) https://lobste.rs/s/dcgzcw
[18:30:26] <gwozniak> And any provided startup code has to account for such things

[18:51:09] <iDrougge> Excel users seem to be generally content.
[18:51:12] <gwozniak> I'd rather use Confluence, to be honest
[18:51:24] <gwozniak> Excel is not bad, though.  I can stomach that.
[18:51:26] <iDrougge> I haven't heard layout professionals complain about InDesign.
[18:52:20] <gwozniak> There are times I prefer using awk to manipulate and calculate things from CSV-like files, but Excel is much better for sharing the data with others (at work, anyway)
[18:52:21] <iDrougge> UX designers seem to like Figma.
