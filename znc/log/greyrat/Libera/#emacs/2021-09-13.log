[00:09:45] <wgreenhouse> kenran: yes, client-side mail splitting for nnimap means gnus will move things into folders on the imap servef
[00:09:55] <wgreenhouse> *server
[00:10:54] <wgreenhouse> the contrast is with filter rules that run serverside even when gnus is not running, like Sieve (which gnus also supports helping you write)

[00:13:53] <kenran> wgreenhouse: the thing is that I haven't yet decided what to use for mail handling, and I'm still looking. To fully evaluate gnus I feel like some sort of splitting is what I'd like, but for alternative ways like notmuch+mbsync+..., I like having one big imap folder containing all emails.

[00:16:49] <wgreenhouse> kenran: yeah, I think you've understood correctly; gnus may just not be that suitable for your workflow. you're looking for a tag-based system and gnus is folder-oriented.
[00:17:53] <kenran> wgreenhouse: But I'm probably missing a lot of options for gnus still. I just found gnus-group-make-search-group, which looks like I could use it to "pseudo-split" my mail
[00:18:47] <wgreenhouse> yes, search results can be treated as groups and even persisted into the initial *Group* buffer. but they don't entirely behave as normal groups.
[00:18:49] <kenran> (side question: how can I delete such a group? Doing G DEL I get 'this back end does not support group deletion')

[00:19:30] <wgreenhouse> kenran: you would just C-k to kill/unsubscribe it. deleting the group (i.e. deleting a folder) isn't sensical for search groups.
[00:21:20] <kenran> wgreenhouse: ah thanks! I was perplexed since I could still see the group when pressing j.
[00:25:58] <kenran> Hm ok, that brings me down to two immediate questions. Suppose I create some fancy mail splitting queries. 1) Can I then split already read mail according to the mechanism, too? 2) Can I move mail around in bulk with gnus/nnimap, such that if I created some groups/folders and later decide that I'd like a different structuring, I can revert it quickly?

[00:51:11] <wgreenhouse> kenran: that's the plus of IMAP, I suppose :)
[00:51:36] <kenran> The need for it to be quite "portable" (I switch machines often and want to have everything working on every machine without problems) is what could push mu4e to the top, though I like its UI the least.

[00:52:26] <kenran> With notmuch, I need a server and muchsync to achieve it, with gnus I need to keep the .newsrc* files in sync. mu4e looks like it doesn't have either of these slight annoyances.
[00:54:17] <bremner> how does mu4e handling syncing state?
[00:55:07] <bremner> oh, by writing headers with tags, maybe?

There's still subtle misbehavior that I can't even reproduce reliably, so I can't even post to the mailing list.

[03:46:37] <parsnip> maybe elisp has breakpoints you can insert in gnus source code, and you could look for "splitting" in gnus source and take a guess at something that _might_ be called, then if it's triggered, you can look a trace for more clues?
[03:46:51] <parsnip> never really tried something like that myself
[03:47:27] <parsnip> maybe you can just toss "throw error" in some clever places in gnus source

[08:29:51] <dragestil_> wgreenhouse: did it work well?
[08:30:31] <wgreenhouse> dragestil_: nnmaildir has (or had at the time, some 5-6 years ago) some pretty extreme performance tradeoffs.
[08:31:29] <dragestil_> ok. for me i don't know how to get it to read dubdir. is the performance problem caused by lack of indexing
[08:31:36] <dragestil_> subdir
[08:32:40] <dragestil_> git blame shows there's not much change to nnmaildir.el since 5-6 years ago
[08:32:44] <wgreenhouse> dragestil_: it is able to read subdirs with a configuration change. and yes--it doesn't wholly lack indexing, more like it re-indexes every startup : D
[08:33:01] <wgreenhouse> so it's fast once the nov cache is warm
[08:33:14] <wgreenhouse> but slow to start (sometimes minutes for me)
[08:33:44] <dragestil_> is nov cache a gnus thing?
[08:34:00] *** Quits: lisp123 (~lisp123@5.30.23.247) (Remote host closed the connection)
[08:34:22] <dragestil_> and gnus does not reindex when using imap?
[08:34:29] <wgreenhouse> basically it means the equivalent of the News OVerview file you'd have with a news server--so an index of most important message headers
[08:34:47] <twb> dragestil_: when using imap, indexing is imap daemon's responsiblity
[08:34:54] <wgreenhouse> ^ yep.
[08:35:01] <dragestil_> ah ok, makes sense (kinda)
[08:35:10] <wgreenhouse> and it turns out imap servers are more optimized at this

[08:40:03] <dragestil_> ok
[08:40:09] <wgreenhouse> anyway nnmaildir in particular is very slow with indexing, because it's a compliant maildir implementation, meaning it has to account for anyone else could randomly move mail around while gnus is running

[08:41:25] <wgreenhouse> dragestil_: that's effectively why people came up with the dovecot proxy trick
[08:41:38] *** Joins: bdju (~bard@user/bdju)
[08:41:40] <dragestil_> that's a bit hacky
[08:41:50] <wgreenhouse> dovecot keeps a warm cache/index, and is better at it than gnus ever would be
[08:42:11] <dragestil_> adding one extra layer to fix a tangential issue
[08:42:30] <wgreenhouse> I'm lazy these days and just use imap like a normal person (i.e. actually talking to the mail host, not a local proxy)
[08:42:43] <parsnip> twb: which one you like better, US Office or UK Office?
[08:42:43] <dragestil_> if dovecot is an indexer then this solution would be nice
[08:42:57] <wgreenhouse> I mean, it is, and a fast cache
[08:42:59] <dragestil_> but it's an imap server
[08:43:14] <wgreenhouse> and it can operate on maildirs well
[08:44:16] <dragestil_> imap/pop3 server
[08:44:18] <wgreenhouse> my old setup was fetchmail+procmail+nnmaildir. I didn't notice the startup slowness I mentioned so long as I never killed emacs, lol

[10:51:54] <parsnip> United States.  Soldiers in World War II used to call peanut butter “monkey butter.”  Food historians have not found any ads or other mentions of peanut butter and jelly sandwiches before the 1940s.

[16:55:31] <akater[m]> garjola_: I agree with what Perry Metzger suggested in his famous (I guess) talk “The Editor of a Lifetime ”: the most promising approach is to build a better Lisp in parallel with Elisp.
[16:55:31] <akater[m]> CLiki suggests a more specific approach: use powerful integration capabilities of ECL to sneak CL in.  I'm not sure if I came to this thought independently or got it from there but I think it's a good idea; CLiki has a little more specifics there.
[16:55:31] <akater[m]> Since Elisp now has native-comp thanks (basically) to efforts of a single person, this should inspire others to believe that the above is not unrealistic and to try.

[16:55:47] <akater[m]> For starters, this should (I think) result in a CL image running within Emacs, and `EMACS-LISP` package in that image; we would then be able to write or run elisp functions by evaluating Common Lisp expressions like `(emacs-lisp:defun ..)` and so on.

[17:06:51] <wasamasa> lol
[17:07:11] <wasamasa> as RMS said it himself, while CL isn't pretty, it has many things notably absent from elisp
[17:07:11] <rnkn> bremner: that does not work for me :(
[17:07:14] <bremner> Guest-liao: the reason is that rms dislike(d,s) cl.el

[17:07:55] <akater[m]> bremmer: I'm sorry.  I'm posting from Matrix, too bad the client does this.
[17:09:15] <akiosakuro> I'm back. Sorry. I have the following LISP in my init.el: `(global-display-line-numbers-mode t)` and try to activate the relative line numbers with `(setq display-line-numbers 'relative)` and it doesn't seem to work. I have linenumbers, but they are not relative to my current position. E.g. when im on line 99 they should be like: [1, 2, 3, 99, 1, 2, 3]

[17:52:09] <akater[m]> contrapunctus: I must admit that I did not understand the “composition mechanism” part when I read your blog entry.  But anyway.  Pervasive use of CLOS may happen even without CL adoption.  E.g. Eric Abrahamsen is working on moving Gnus to eieio / cl-generic.  `map.el` has recently been ported to cl-generic; I don't think it was a terribly good idea but it shows that there's interest to OO in Emacs.  And I think even such gradual reworking
[17:52:09] <akater[m]> of Emacs internals is more likely to result in pervasive use of CLOS than starting from scratch.
[17:52:14] <akater[m]> contrapunctus: As for GUI and graphics… well, if you really want a cool but non-emacsy feature (like in-buffer animations), you still can have it right now — but having CL inside would make it easier.  Progress in Emacs (and in “free” domains in general) is mostly driven by very determined people who want something really bad.  Cliched but true: tools won't turn Emacs into anything, people do.  But powerful tools will aid those people
[17:52:14] <akater[m]> greatly.

[17:59:53] <grift> i use emacs-nox on console with the pinentry server from elpa/melpa with epg/loopback and gpg agent allow emacs/loopback pinentry. this works fine on fedora but on debian magit fails to sign and gpg-agent say's PKSIGN failed inappropriate ioctl. in debian signing a file with tools > encryption > sign file works fine though (pinentry prompts me for the pin inside emacs fine)

[18:12:01] <akater[m]> ASDF uses multiple dispatch completely fine.  There's even one 3-arguments gf.
[18:12:10] <grift> bremner: do you know the link to the emacs repository on debian salsa, i can'r find it
[18:12:31] <rpav> asdf as i recall doesn't do a whole lot of multi-specialization or method combination
[18:13:19] <akater[m]> CLOS-based protocols take some care to design.  I think many people misuse CLOS.
[18:13:27] <grift> i suppose i will have to build it myself, not sure how they expect one to use emacs-nox without a pinentry but okay, debian is debian
[18:14:24] <rpav> akater[m]: well "if you're really really careful it works ok" isn't a particularly compelling argument, because it puts all the onus on the developer for making sure the dominos will fall correctly, rather than having the computer do the work it ought, and provide transparency

[18:16:14] <rudi> I mean, trying to program something in, say, the eclipse framework is quite unpleasant for me, and that one only has single-dispatch and lots of twisty little classes
[18:16:14] <rpav> i urge you to go use it in depth and reevaluate just how useful the parts are or not, and how easy it is to debug
[18:17:17] <rpav> (i _did_ write some MOP query stuff but even that's a mixed bag, as MOP is very underdocumented/ underexampled even if you have AMOP on hand, and the API is particularly obtuse)

[18:20:17] <akater[m]> No programming system would produce good modular designs on its own.  But CLOS tries to help with this task as hard as possible.
[18:20:53] <rpav> e.g. if i give you a generic on (A B), with a customization for ((A class) B) and (A (B superclass)) and ((A superclass) (B class)) can _you_ tell me off hand the well-defined ordering? ;) then add some :before/:after on specific classes ...
[18:21:02] <rpav> akater[m]: it really does not
[18:21:47] <rpav> if you have very limited cases like ASDF, where it defines some things on some specific symbols here and there it can work ok
[18:22:03] <contrapunctus> rpav: I'm saying, can't a tool trivially answer that for the programmer? O.o

[21:26:10] <bpalmer> crowbar: first, you could simply (require 'mu4e) and (require 'magit) in your functions, to ensure that they're loaded (or, rather, that the respective features are provided)
[21:26:29] <bpalmer> crowbar: but if you do want to check on the autoloads, make sure that those functions you call have been given autoload cookies in the source; it's possible that the author didn't think they would be meaningful entry points into the package.
[21:27:51] <bpalmer> crowbar: I"m not entirely positive how the package system deals with these, but it's likely that it creates a loaddefs file that you can make sure is loaded.
[21:28:18] <bpalmer> crowbar: you can also set up the autoloads manually; either with the autoload function, or if you use use-package, with one of its keywords.

[22:21:00] <technomancy> oh wow neorg is forking the format with a new spec
[22:21:04] <Guest9231> wasamasa did you look at lunarvim https://www.lunarvim.org/#opinionated the interface looks intuitive and modern, altough it may seem eye candy only but if emacs could have a UI layer to wrap the utilities it may be more convenient what do you think É
[22:21:13] <wasamasa> lol
[22:21:29] <wasamasa> do you think you could write write messages fitting in 440 chars or less
[22:21:31] <bremner> Guest9231: I think if looks are your priority, emacs is probably not going to make you havppy
[22:21:40] <wasamasa> isn't lunarvim a vim config?
[22:21:42] <bremner> or even happy

[22:22:49] <technomancy> that said neorg's forked syntax fixes my #1 complaint about org's: the code block delimiters are non-hideous
[22:22:59] <wasamasa> what happened to vimmers being heavily into understanding their text editor and tweaking its config options excessively

[22:25:50] <Guest9231> is it possible to wrap for exemple vertico with a UI layer ? unfortunately emacs has only one widget , the text "text-widget" , but is it possible to create a modern UI with text-object widget to create side by side buffers because for some maybe not familiar users it may add an easy mode

[23:32:35] <kuba-orlik8> is there an easy way to list all properties of a plist?

[23:33:18] <acdw> i think a plist is just a paired list, so yeah -- you could (cl-loop for (keys _) on plist by 'cddr ..)

[23:37:12] <acdw> hold on, let me write up legit loops
[23:38:25] <bpalmer> (print prop)  , for example.
[23:39:56] <acdw> kuba-orlik : https://ttm.sh/tXm.txt
[23:40:00] <acdw> or what bpalmer said
[23:47:27] <bpalmer> acdw: incidentally, I'd wrap your pop loop with (let ((plist plist))  ...) so that you only locally modify things.

[23:49:11] <acdw> honestly since alphapapa[m] showed me cl-loop, i gott say that bad boi is a good oen
[23:50:09] <bkhl> (Since otherwise I'll be on Emacs 26)
[23:50:13] <alphapapa[m]> (mapcar #'keywordp PLIST)
[23:50:22] <acdw> oh even better
[23:50:32] <alphapapa[m]> assuming it's a "proper" plist that uses keyword symbols
[23:50:44] <alphapapa[m]> or (map-keys PLIST)
[23:51:00] <acdw> comin in clutch with the knowledge

[23:51:58] <bpalmer> keywordp to distinguish keys won't do the right thing in the general plist case, so I wouldn't endorse it.

[23:56:04] <alphapapa[m]> That's true.  Some of us in Emacsland tend to forget that keywords are also valid values.
