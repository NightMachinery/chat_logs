[23:36:31] <namkeleser> Does anyone notice any flaws in this hashing in algorithm? Is it secure? https://pastebin.com/ncv5kb85
[23:40:53] <ms7821> it's called SecureCipher so it's almost 100% not
[23:42:33] <namkeleser> ms7821 What?
[23:42:38] <sonOfRa> I don't notice any flaws, and I am also very certain that it is not secure.
[23:43:33] <namkeleser> sonOfRa what makes you certain?
[23:43:46] <Alipha> namkeleser: any low-level algorithm like that that wasn't written by a professional cryptographer and studied and pounded on by other cryptographers is very unlikely to be secure because writing secure crypto algorithms is hard
[23:44:09] <sonOfRa> It's a piece of python code on pastebin, rather than a paper written in LaTeX submitted to actual professional cryptographers
[23:44:20] <ms7821> namkeleser, in practice, the only trustworthy hashes are widely adopted and studied, like SHA3 or Argon2
[23:44:26] <namkeleser> I am aware, I just want to know if anyone notices any flaws in it
[23:44:40] <namkeleser> This is just for fun
[23:44:41] <ms7821> anything else is not even worth spending looking at unless you're asking for homework
[23:44:51] <namkeleser> Not to be used in production or use.
[23:44:56] <namkeleser> Learning exercise
[23:45:09] <ms7821> also, SHA1 is called Secure, and it isn't
[23:45:56] <ms7821> I'd expect a hash like this to come with a rationale anyway. Are you expecting people to just impute all the design decisions you've made?
[23:46:20] <Alipha> unfortunately, i think the one person who may have a chance at quickly identifying a flaw no longer comes to irc, sighs
[23:46:32] <namkeleser> Is that yarrkov?
[23:46:39] <namkeleser> Alipha
[23:46:58] <sonOfRa> Riastradh, probably. Haven't heard from yarrkov in ages
[23:47:16] <Alipha> Riastradh, yeah
[23:47:26] <namkeleser> Ah why both of them not come here anymore
[23:47:46] <namkeleser> THey were both long time IRC guys
[23:48:14] <sonOfRa> Riastradh stopped coming after the freenode fracture, no idea about yarrkov.
[23:48:52] <namkeleser> yarrkov still has his nick to contact him on irc on his website
[23:49:14] <namkeleser> But yeah never on
[23:49:47] <Alipha> Riastradh DID come here to libera for a little while
[23:49:47] <namkeleser> Anyone else here a crryptographer?
[23:49:54] <Hash> Ask your question
[23:50:00] <namkeleser> I did
[23:50:02] <Hash> Instead of looking for someone
[23:50:05] <Hash> Then be patient.
[23:50:13] <Hash> Not everyone of  us 265 people are here at all times.
[23:50:24] <Hash> When someone sees it, they will reply, if they have something to add.
[23:50:50] <ms7821> why do you xor the sbox with key[0]?
[23:51:29] <Hash> Homework is fine. I study out here in the open, and people lecture me, help me, guide me.
[23:51:47] <Hash> I do exams and tests all on my own because that's testing my own knowledge retention/memory
[23:51:57] <Hash> So cheating makes no sense in this field.
[23:52:11] <Hash> If you cheat, and have others do your work, you won't be able to perform in the industry.
[23:52:29] <namkeleser> Hash Who said this is homework?
[23:52:31] <Hash> Homework and study is fine. Just don't make anyone do your work for you. 
[23:52:34] <namkeleser> I wrote this hash lol...
[23:52:37] <Hash> No one. I think ms7821 alluded it to a while ago
[23:53:04] <Hash> I was just offering my take on it.
[23:53:19] *** Joins: sav_ (~savio@177.12.48.155)
[23:53:54] <Hash> I have to go through flash casds today for 3 modules. Every time I do a module, I study that end of chapter quiz, flash cards etc.
[23:54:07] <Hash> But then I also go do chapter 1 flashcards again, chapter 2 again.
[23:54:33] <ms7821> namkeleser, just from reading through I'm seeing a few things that don't explain themselves
[23:54:34] <Hash> Then when I study chapter 4, I'll do that end bit, but then do 1, 2, 3 again, just to retain memory and keep it in my head.
[23:55:19] <namkeleser> ms7821 such as?
[23:55:24] <ms7821> why do you xor the sbox with key[0]?
[23:55:37] <ms7821> why do you call the block a key?
[23:55:46] <Hash> I'm confused.
[23:55:51] <ms7821> why is the compression called encryption?
[23:55:57] <Hash> A block is a block of data, chunked into 64 or 128 bits
[23:56:12] <Hash> Key is also 128 256 or higher bit
[23:56:18] <Hash> You pad the data, and xor with key
[23:56:31] <Hash> ms7821: are you asking these question in general?
[23:56:39] <Hash> Can you just look up the definitions? I'm got confused
[23:56:46] <ms7821> why is digest('') all zeroes?
[23:56:52] <namkeleser> what compression?
[23:56:54] <Hash> Is this a troll?
[23:56:58] <Hash> I can't tell.
[23:56:59] <ms7821> Hash, please shut up
[23:57:05] <Hash> See?
[23:57:07] <Hash> Yup.
[23:57:09] <namkeleser> herre the test is the key
[23:57:21] <namkeleser> and it is 32 bytes so it is one block
[23:57:48] <ms7821> well also the class seems to require key to be 32 bytes, but you only assert outside it
[23:57:52] <int-e> SecureHash(b'0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000').digest() is 0 is equal to SecureHash(b'don\'t implement your own crypto don\'t implement your own crypto ').digest()
[23:58:03] <Hash> Exactly
[23:58:16] <Hash> Same as don't invent your own auth system, use a industry strength tested one.
[23:58:19] <namkeleser> thats the intial state
[23:58:23] <namkeleser> the all 0's
[23:58:42] <int-e> namkeleser: so how did it get back into the initial state that easily?
[23:58:51] <namkeleser> so now we know that the digest is the encryption of test
