[00:18:07] <dminkovsky> i had a soundblaster 16 i'm pretty sure
[00:18:21] <dminkovsky> with my pentium 166 computer
[00:18:37] <dminkovsky> but i didn't come to own one of those mics until probably .... 2000?
[00:19:02] <dminkovsky> at which point i owned several; and none of them produced any sound on any soundcard i tried them with except muffled strange static
[00:19:07] <dminkovsky> maybe i just had some bad ones
[00:22:11] <manicennui> I had a couple of different SoundBlasters over the years.
[00:22:15] <manicennui> Don't remember the models.
[00:22:40] <manicennui> Maybe those mics don't understand Ukrainian.
[00:23:39] <manicennui> Dude
[00:23:43] <manicennui> Look at their current models

[00:23:54] <manicennui> Super cool!
[00:25:23] <dminkovsky> A signal to noise ratio or SNR of 116dB means your audio will be more than 99.99% pristine, which is over 35.4 times better than motherboard audio.
[00:25:41] <dminkovsky> * only with a MonsterHD cable
[00:26:25] <manicennui> How my sound card looks is way more important.
[00:26:51] <manicennui> It even comes with a mic!
[00:27:03] <manicennui> Sound Blaster Beamforming Microphone
[00:27:03] <manicennui> When used with CrystalVoice Focus, the bundled beamforming microphone creates an acoustic zone and suppresses noise outside it, enabling you to be heard with amazing clarity.
[00:28:26] <manicennui> They have some "better" cards, but they don't look as cool.
[00:29:21] <manicennui> I wonder what people doing professional audio production use.

[00:30:02] <dminkovsky> i don't know anything about sound :/
[00:30:49] <manicennui> Audio production seems so cool, but I have no reason to mess with it.
[00:31:09] <manicennui> I don't even have a podcast that I can procrastinate about as a reason to buy a bunch of equipment.
[00:31:21] <manicennui> I think I want to get back into photography.
[00:31:37] <dminkovsky> got to get a podcast
[00:31:38] <manicennui> I would like to make music, but I'd be starting from zero.

[00:35:15] *** Joins: jeho (~jehoshaph@user/jehoshaphat)
[00:37:06] <indigo> Also, I think pro audio production folks are usually more interested in how many inputs/outputs the sound card has, rather than the SNR

[01:31:24] <dminkovsky> i was accidentally stumbled into an discussion/argument about 24-bit/192kHz audio
[01:31:47] <dminkovsky> i couldn't care less one way or another whether someone does or does not perceive the quality
[01:32:11] <dminkovsky> but i stated carelessly by accident that i didn't think it could be perceived cause human ear/brain limitations
[01:32:20] <dminkovsky> and this person got pretty offended i could see
[01:32:29] <dminkovsky> it turned out they were a huge 24/192 torrenter
[01:32:38] <dminkovsky> and only listened to music in 24/192
[01:32:59] <indigo> Only 24? Sadness, 32 bit float is where it's at
[01:33:09] <dminkovsky> it was a hard one to wriggle myself out of and i never did
[01:33:19] <dminkovsky> indigo: is 32 a thing really? that exists?
[01:33:34] <indigo> Yes :-) Internally, my DAW processes everything in 32-bit float
[01:33:44] <dminkovsky> nice
[01:34:00] <indigo> High sample rates and bit rates make sense when you are doing audio production
[01:34:06] <dminkovsky> yeah
[01:34:31] <dminkovsky> like 16/24+ bit raw processing
[01:34:36] <indigo> Eg. you don't need to set your levels as cautiously if you have 32 bits of dynamic range
[01:34:46] <dminkovsky> yeah
[01:34:54] <dminkovsky> anyway i have 16 dollar earbuds so
[01:34:58] <indigo> And 192KHz might be nice if you are warping samples
[01:35:02] <dminkovsky> v0 is more than fine for me
[01:35:11] <indigo> Yeah, v0 is my go-to for encoding music
[01:35:19] <indigo> I used to be all about FLAC
[01:35:52] <indigo> FLAC is neat if you want to re-encode stuff, but what player doesn't support v0 MP3 these days
[01:36:37] <dminkovsky> i like having FLACs though
[01:37:12] <dminkovsky> unless it's just a throaway listen
[01:37:43] <dminkovsky> i'm bummed i still haven't done a media server
[01:37:51] <dminkovsky> first i need to get a server, though
[01:37:58] <dminkovsky> though maybe i could use a Pi?
[01:38:39] <dminkovsky> i do have a Pi
[01:40:50] <mouseghost> whats v0?
[01:47:13] <indigo> dminkovsky: You could try! Navidrome is pretty RAM-hungry for some reason though
[01:47:43] <indigo> mouseghost: V0 is an encoding preset for Variable Bit Rate (VBR) MP3
[01:47:49] <mouseghost> ah
[01:47:53] <mouseghost> but its lossy, right?
[01:48:00] <indigo> Yes, it is lossy
[01:49:23] <dminkovsky> i should have done this during my failed vacation between christmas and new years
[01:49:40] <dminkovsky> could have been a success
[01:52:15] <indigo> dminkovsky: I can send you my config if you want :) I use a systemd unit to run a podman Navidrome container

[02:35:56] <manicennui> He showed me some flyer and asked whether I had responded to it, and if so, I should see a credit on my bill, and to confirm that I had received the credit.
[02:36:07] <manicennui> I told him that I wasn't interested and to get out of our building.

[03:43:10] <gwozniak> The companies doing that are the scum of the Earth
[03:43:52] <gwozniak> I did not feel good working there, which was part of the reason I left
[03:44:12] <gwozniak> I made the mistake of thinking it would get better.  I was wrong.
[03:44:32] <gwozniak> Frankly, I kind of regret enabling that shit
[03:45:43] <gwozniak> Because the tactics used by those companies is so egregiously immoral that if there is a Hell, the company execs should absolutely go there
[03:47:23] <gwozniak> One of those people tried to get in our building once.  No way I was letting that happen.
[03:47:45] <manicennui> There are far too many of them and they all seem scamy.
[03:47:54] <manicennui> I've never had anyone recommend one of them.
[03:48:17] <manicennui> There isn't even one that seems to be well known.

[03:50:28] <manicennui> I worked for a dotcom in 2000 that was trying to copy Yahoo. They eventually started working with this scamy telemarketing company on banner ads. It was pretty bad.
[03:53:27] <manicennui> They'd sell crap like "travel clubs" where you'd get "free" airline tickets.

[07:59:05] <imode> no, it's to commit tax fraud.
[07:59:11] <imode> as with anything in life.

[17:16:16] <kronk> everything hurts.
[17:21:15] <skyl4rk> sick? hungover? emotional turmoil?
[17:25:37] <kronk> COVID booster.
[17:26:04] <kronk> heavy fever, chills, aches, fatigue
[17:26:35] <kronk> ibuprofen is keeping me together. my wife isn't a wimp, so she's sleeping fine.
[17:26:56] <skyl4rk> ah, you got the complete package
[17:27:08] <kronk> overnight delivery too.
[17:27:54] <skyl4rk> some people get to have all the fun
[17:27:56] <kronk> I didn't think armpit pain would be this bad. must be lymph nodes swelling
[17:28:52] <kronk> getting up felt like I was made of sticks. we got moderna, and we mixed with 2 pfizer shots.
[17:29:07] <skyl4rk> I'm not eligble for a booster yet, but I've been mostly ok from the two first shots I think, arm pain, like not being able to lift it in certain angles, and mild flu-like symptoms
[17:29:28] <kronk> yeah once you get over it it's totally fine.
[17:29:41] <kronk> I'm just a baby
[17:30:15] <kronk> can safely say that the booster hits harder than shot 2
[17:32:57] <skyl4rk> at some point there will be a vaccine variant of the mixing alcoholic drinks saying ...pfizer before modena... can't find a good rhyme right now though
[17:33:37] <defect> pfizer before moderna, that'll burn ya?
[17:33:40] <jjuran> Hey, everyone.  Have a somber 1/6.
[17:33:41] <defect> sorry, that's terrible :P
[17:34:41] <skyl4rk> it's a start, but have to change the number of syllables to get a good flow, still more than I came up with
[17:34:52] <skyl4rk> half the point is to make it terrible though heh
[17:36:17] * jjuran looks forward to his imminent rule over ancient Smyrna
[17:38:27] <kronk> Pfizer before Moderna, that'll burn ya. Moderna before Pfizer, you're none the wiser.
[17:38:38] <kronk> also happy coup day.
[17:40:47] <jjuran> I don't think "happy" is the right sentiment
[17:40:59] <jjuran> Hence "somber"
[17:41:07] <jjuran> "Vigilant" also works
[17:41:38] <imode> heh.
[17:57:34] <skyl4rk> the revolution will be teleevangelized
[18:00:18] <skyl4rk> Pfizer before moderna, that will surely burn ya, moderna before Pfizer, you will be none the wiser
[18:01:12] <gwozniak> I may be testing that one since I may be getting a Moderna after Pfizer
[18:02:51] <imode> it hurrrrts.
[18:03:21] <skyl4rk> I'm just happy my phone plan covers a booster shot
[18:33:22] <riv> is that a 5g phone?
[18:36:26] <skyl4rk> that's the joke, but no in reality I don't have a 5G phone, it wasn't really a thing when I last upgraded/replaced the previous one
[18:36:57] <ngoldbaum> i have one at least in the US 5g is just marketing mostly
[18:37:26] <ngoldbaum> verizon is going to turn on a new sideband soon but i’m in an area they won’t do that until 2024 because of a military base
[18:37:47] <ngoldbaum> also the new band is right next to 2.4 ghz band i’m sure wifi reception won’t take a hit at all
[18:38:03] <companion_cube> throw away your wifi and embrace 5g
[18:38:09] <companion_cube> in your soul and body and T-cells
[18:38:19] <companion_cube> (T-mobile cells? 🤔)
[18:38:26] <ngoldbaum> tbf if you’re using wifi at 2.4 ghz you’re a sucker
[18:38:30] <prussian> oh. I thought they were going to use the 5Ghz unlicensed, not ~2.4ishGHz
[18:38:52] <skyl4rk> 5g isn't really /one/ thing, so unqualified "this device has 5G" doesn't really say more than that it's fairly new
[18:38:59] <prussian> anyhow ya, my 5G is still NR NSA
[18:39:15] <prussian> like all things, it's just word word word.
[18:39:22] <prussian> i am waiting for 6G myself.
[18:39:28] <ngoldbaum> oh you’re right c band is next to 5 ghz
[18:39:35] <ngoldbaum> rsvp everyone’s wifi
[18:39:49] <prussian> time to move to Wifi6
[18:40:08] <prussian> which I think has FHSS
[18:40:10] <prussian> I THINK
[18:40:31] <companion_cube> wireless ethernet 2.0
[18:40:40] <prussian> the future is now.
[18:40:51] <ngoldbaum> “wireless fidelity” is a weird name
[18:41:05] <ngoldbaum> i am faithful to my wireless frequencies
[18:41:06] <skyl4rk> think I read it's a backronym
[18:41:20] <prussian> I bet 6GHz weather radios are going to love WiFi 6E
[18:41:21] <prussian> lol
[18:41:28] <companion_cube> wire fiduciary
[18:41:47] <ngoldbaum> retvrn to 2.4 ghz
[18:41:49] <prussian> I already joke and call twisted pair ethernet as "wifi cables"
[18:41:56] <ngoldbaum> embrace tradition
[18:42:09] <prussian> honestly, 2.4GHz would probably be ok with better spectral use.
[18:42:47] <companion_cube> you're going to scare the christians
[18:42:48] <prussian> but god forbid we use MIC radio technologies in our wee fees.
[18:42:55] <companion_cube> "there's ghosts in wifi?"
[18:42:59] <prussian> lol
[18:43:05] <prussian> "yes"
[18:43:18] * ngoldbaum reminisces about his first 802.11b wifi dongle in 2004
[18:43:32] <prussian> I'm sorry.
[18:46:30] <imode> companion_cube: spooky networking
[18:46:56] <ngoldbaum> dad didn’t want to run a cable across the house so he was one of the first dads who had to deal with children asking him to reset the wireless access point every day or so
[18:47:26] <ngoldbaum> and somehow wifi is still extremely janky in 2022
[18:49:10] <jlindgren> it'll always be "you didn't buy a fancy enough router" - router manufacturers
[18:49:23] <jlindgren> saw one released at CES that has moving antennas to get the best signal, insane
[18:50:54] <prussian> Honestly, I blame everything wrong with wifi on some mixture of export control or intentional hate of users. maybe patents too, maybe.
[19:11:07] <skyl4rk> too sturdy walls are the bane of wifi as well, can't have a second floor if you want to beam cats to your phone
[19:14:49] <skyl4rk> wood beams, steel beams, radio beams, all interfering with each other
[19:19:57] <Brekkjern> WiFi is the worst best solution to the problem...
[19:20:00] <Brekkjern> Fuck I hate WiFi
[19:21:06] *** Joins: bontaq (~user@ool-45779fe5.dyn.optonline.net)
[20:01:38] <ngoldbaum> skyl4rk: wifi doesn’t melt steel beams
[20:02:01] <skyl4rk> yeah, and that's the problem, it can't blow a hole through and I get no reception
[20:02:33] <skyl4rk> we need ethernet over high power infra-red laser
[20:02:45] <ngoldbaum> need to upgrade to WiDEW; wireless directed energy weapon
[20:03:08] <ngoldbaum> lol apparently there are idiots who think the marshall fire in boulder was started by a directed energy weapons test
[20:03:22] <ngoldbaum> because some idiot burning debris is somehow less plausible
[20:03:38] <skyl4rk> it was jewish space wifi obviously
[20:04:01] <manicennui> Shhhhh
[20:04:12] <manicennui> The goys aren't supposed to know
[20:06:09] * manicennui imagines a bunch of old Jewish men sitting around speaking Yiddish in the laser control center
[20:08:09] <ngoldbaum> the elders of zion
[20:08:24] <ngoldbaum> for some reason there’s a harry potter goblin too
[20:09:10] <skyl4rk> so, this protocols of the elders of zion (or whatever it's called) something like TCP/IP illustrated? is it good?
[20:10:38] <skyl4rk> ...at some point I might start to worry about being quoted out of context, but in that case I might as well worry about people making things up entirely...
[20:11:43] <ngoldbaum> tbh ##crustaceans has the fewest conpiracizing crazies of any channels i’m in on freenode
[20:11:48] <ngoldbaum> err, libera
[20:12:36] <skyl4rk> that's what they want you to believe!
[20:12:38] <ngoldbaum> every once in a while ##cooking and ##cycling devolve into arguing about covid vaccines
[20:12:57] <ngoldbaum> probably all human discourse these days goes in that direction :/
[20:19:45] <skyl4rk> someone went into image settings and turned up contrast everywhere
[20:26:53] <indigo> I mean, we just don’t know enough about the vaccines yet
[20:27:21] <Brekkjern> Speaking of vaccines, getting the booster tomorrow evening. Planning on being sick on saturday.
[20:28:10] <indigo> Good luck Brekkjern!
[20:28:17] <Brekkjern> Thanks :)

[20:29:14] <Brekkjern> Fun fact. Gif is not a very efficient format :P

[20:29:45] <buttsbot> Dell XPS 13 Plus hands-on: is that... a touch bar? - The Verge
[20:29:58] <skyl4rk> I find the <don't know enough> not very useful unless accompanied with <in order to X> and <when the alternative is Y>
[20:31:42] <manicennui> 🤦‍♂️
[20:32:45] <skyl4rk> are those four question marks, or some unicode shenanigans my client won't render?
[20:33:36] <manicennui> I honestly don't know what my client sent.
[20:33:54] <manicennui> I assume some unicode.
[20:34:08] <skyl4rk> ah other client is showing some facepalming emoji
[20:34:52] <ngoldbaum> the new macbook pros looking increasingly attractive
[20:34:56] <Brekkjern> It's showing a facepalm emoji and a male symbol for me
[20:36:03] <indigo> The air is still super neat
[20:36:13] <skyl4rk> my openbsd install more or less re-encodes anything non-ascii as a question mark when outputting to terminal or ssh, not sure why, don't care enough to try to fix it
[20:36:31] <ngoldbaum> indigo: i hate having only two usb ports
[20:36:47] <ngoldbaum> maybe i should wait until they update the low end models to get rid of the touchbar…
[20:38:23] <manicennui> They should license the touchbar tech out while they remove it.
[20:39:59] <indigo> ngoldbaum: makes sense. I rarely use a laptop except when traveling, so no need for a ton of ports
[20:40:23] <ngoldbaum> i don’t like having a desktop and a laptop

[20:40:29] <buttsbot> Lol. Elon Musk's Boring company has traffic jams. I was told it was impossible. : fuckcars
[20:40:41] <ngoldbaum> rather just have the laptop that plugs into a dock or whatever
[20:40:49] <ngoldbaum> which means few ports is ok
[20:41:00] <ngoldbaum> but two ports and no charging port on the air is bogus
[20:42:21] <riv> ummmmmmmm
[20:42:28] <ngoldbaum> if they update the low end macbook pros to get rid of the touchbar, add magsafe charging i’d be happy with that
[20:42:34] <riv> ok
[20:42:40] <riv> make people drive cars through tiny tubes
[20:42:47] <riv> did not know this was a thing
[20:42:49] <riv> great
[20:44:15] <manicennui> Musk is just continuing the tradition of auto makers doing everything they can to sabotage public transportation.
[20:45:19] <manicennui> He's trying to sell everyone on letting him bore tunnels everywhere and then buy his cars and let them drive really close together.
[20:45:46] <manicennui> He'll make a fuckton of money on all this, but that's a sacrifice he is willing to make.
[20:46:00] <manicennui> It will be totally worth it right before society collapses.
[20:49:06] <bontaq> the dividends tho
[20:49:14] <manicennui> It would solve the autopilot problems.
[20:49:24] <manicennui> No need to understand anything other than boreholes.
[20:49:43] <manicennui> "Please enter a Borehole to continue driving."
[21:07:41] <riv> wtf
[21:07:49] <riv> why do people like him
[21:08:40] <skyl4rk> because they believe he is tony stark

[21:49:03] <jjuran> ngoldbaum: I don't always expand "WiFi", but when I do, it's "wireless fiber"
[21:49:45] <ngoldbaum> weefee
[21:51:18] <skyl4rk> troubles with traffic congestion? your computer might need higher quality wifi in its diet
[21:53:41] <manicennui> The name Wi-Fi, commercially used at least as early as August 1999,[22] was coined by the brand-consulting firm Interbrand. The Wi-Fi Alliance had hired Interbrand to create a name that was "a little catchier than 'IEEE 802.11b Direct Sequence'."[23][24] Phil Belanger, a founding member of the Wi-Fi Alliance, has stated that the term Wi-Fi was chosen from a list of ten potential names invented by Interbrand.[23]
[21:54:33] <manicennui> The name Wi-Fi has no further meaning, and was never officially a shortened form of "Wireless Fidelity".
[21:54:43] <manicennui> I honestly had never thought about that before.
[21:54:55] <manicennui> I guess Interbrand is good at what they do.
[21:54:56] <jjuran> skyl4rk: Enormous amounts of material clogging the tubes
[21:55:38] <jjuran> Why would it be "wireless fidelity"?  Because of "hi-fi"?
[21:55:57] <prussian> uggggggghhhhhhhhhhhh
[21:55:58] <jjuran> But what about "sci-fi"?  Would you call it "wireless fiction"?
[21:56:09] <prussian> sure.
[21:56:42] <jjuran> Wireless may be a spectrum, but it's not on the one from low to high
[21:57:01] <prussian> oh, it's on a spectrum.
[21:59:28] <manicennui> Wireless Finland
[22:00:06] <manicennui> Of course we are just assuming that Wi is Wireless.
[22:06:05] <prussian> great, I am doing what I feared most. creating a whole PKI for the company I worked for. I think it's time to quit
[22:07:38] <indigo> prussian: Make it decentralized

[22:16:12] <companion_cube> no worries, it's all decentralized
[22:16:33] <prussian> well I imagine miners everywhere else are doing ok.
[22:16:38] <prussian> lmao
[22:16:55] <prussian> why can't I scroll this article? god damnit. do i have to inspect elements every fucking news site now?
[22:17:04] <manicennui> Are there any Middle Eastern monarchies putting a bunch of resources into solar powered mining?
[22:17:05] <defect> time to start mining on my rpi and make bank
[22:18:17] <ngoldbaum> apparently kazakhstan was 15% of the global hash rate
[22:18:42] <companion_cube> in a few years, cryptoland will be responsible for 30% of hashrate, don't worry
[22:18:52] <ngoldbaum> definitely great that we invented a technology where a strongman can divert coal plants to bitcoin mining and extract free dollars
[22:18:52] <buttsbot> More like buttcoin, am I rite!?
[22:19:51] <prussian> ok I found it... .sp-message-open class
[22:19:52] <ngoldbaum> also, why does bitcoin have value anymore?
[22:20:09] <ngoldbaum> at one point it was as a putative payment vehicle
[22:20:11] <prussian> webdevs: 0, evil ad blocking demon users: 1
[22:20:14] <companion_cube> it's the value repository, ngoldbaum
[22:20:16] <ngoldbaum> but i’m pretty sure no one does that anymkre
[22:20:36] <ngoldbaum> git push value
[22:20:42] <manicennui> Just speculation, like most stock.
[22:21:13] <companion_cube> ngoldbaum: just don't rebase it ok?
[22:22:02] <ngoldbaum> it’s ok i can only rebase once i get control of 50% of the butts
[22:22:37] <companion_cube> 50% of the butts is a lot of butts
[22:22:50] <companion_cube> or it could even be the left cheek of 100% of the butts
[22:23:05] <companion_cube> which is quite a stake in mankind
[22:24:09] * ngoldbaum gets the brand ready
[22:24:19] <prussian> In cryptoland we trust.
[22:24:57] <companion_cube> surprised they didn't register crypto.land
[22:25:00] <companion_cube> probably already taken
[22:25:26] <manicennui> Oh, is cryptoland real
[22:25:28] <manicennui> ?
[22:25:35] <manicennui> I thought you all were joking.
[22:25:47] <companion_cube> well
[22:25:52] <companion_cube> there was an amazing video yesterday

[22:28:35] <companion_cube> yeeeeep
[22:36:57] <manicennui> What is the status of Sealand?
[22:38:03] <manicennui> Not clear from the wikipedia article.
[22:41:16] <ngoldbaum> it’s a charming hobbit-filled country southeast of australia
[22:50:42] <skyl4rk> more like value suppository
[22:51:44] <skyl4rk> is there any way to wing writing a parser while out of practice (or never having been in), and not be totally miserable?
[22:52:31] <ngoldbaum> depends on what you’re doing
[22:52:52] <ngoldbaum> hand-crafted reverse descent parsers that do one thing well are ok
[22:53:09] <ngoldbaum> err recursive descent
[22:53:58] <skyl4rk> the only descent here is mine, into madness
[22:54:14] <indigo> +1 to recursive descent, but you might want to write a toy parser first to get the hang of it
[22:55:24] <skyl4rk> that is an answer in itself I guess, the project is not in the correct fun/serious quadrant to warrant that level of yak shaving
[22:57:27] <ngoldbaum> yolo do it with regex and str.split()
[22:57:36] <ngoldbaum> Brekkjern style
[22:57:50] <Brekkjern> Shit works 99% of the time. Good enough for me.
[22:58:04] <manicennui> skyl4rk: ANTLR?
[22:58:18] <skyl4rk> that's more like it, but I'm actually quite low on regex use, seeing as I'm writing perl
[22:58:27] <companion_cube> PEG?
[22:58:45] <manicennui> "I'm actually quite low on regex use, seeing as I'm writing perl"
[22:58:48] <manicennui> Does not compute.

[23:02:46] <ngoldbaum> the booster?
[23:02:54] <companion_cube> is advil the brand name for ibuprofen?
[23:04:08] <defect> the most common brand in the us at least, i think

[23:06:15] <imode> moderna after pfizer
[23:06:30] <ngoldbaum> ah have fun
[23:06:34] <imode> my muscles keep locking up
[23:06:39] <imode> and spasming
[23:06:45] <imode> so fun
[23:06:52] <ngoldbaum> eat a banana?
[23:10:14] <indigo> Yeah I ended up vomiting the next morning after my moderna shot
[23:10:31] <companion_cube> fwiw, covid sucks more, even if vaccinated
[23:10:32] <indigo> Although I was dumb and didn't take any ibuprofen until that same morning
[23:10:51] <indigo> I'm going out to get some COVID of my own in a few hours
[23:10:56] <indigo> So that will be fun
[23:11:08] <companion_cube> be sure to get omicron
[23:11:15] <companion_cube> healthier than delta!
[23:11:25] <indigo> Yeah for sure
[23:11:52] <indigo> Stupid fillings... I wish my parents did sealant for me when I was a kid
[23:12:08] <ngoldbaum> there is apparently zero delta circulating in denver now
[23:12:16] <ngoldbaum> pretty amazing how quick it died out
[23:13:00] <indigo> I wonder if omicron will be the variant to make COVID endemic
[23:13:29] <indigo> And then we can go back to "normal" worker exploitation
[23:14:00] <Brekkjern> Man, fuck you ffmpeg!
[23:14:01] <epilys> covid is already endemic
[23:14:03] <Brekkjern> Jesus fucking christ...
[23:14:24] <gwozniak> Brekkjern: what, you don't want to learn its massive command line interface?
[23:14:34] <gwozniak> ``At some point, the linker emulation entry points should be documented.''
[23:14:41] <gwozniak> Thanks, GNU ld
[23:15:03] <gwozniak> Been around, what, 30+ years at this point?
[23:15:52] <indigo> epilys: Well, to the point where it's "if we remove all restrictions, hospitals capacity will still be OK"
[23:16:09] <indigo> Brekkjern: What are you ffmpeging?
[23:16:17] <Brekkjern> The problem with ffmpeg isn't just the enormous amounts of switches, but that it some of the dumbest software ever developed
[23:16:23] <Brekkjern> It crashes on EVERYTHING
[23:16:49] <Brekkjern> "Oh, there's a thumbnail image here? I guess I'll try the h264 encoder on it too!"
[23:17:14] <Brekkjern> indigo: Just some scenes from Arcane I want to chop up
[23:17:24] <Brekkjern> And transcode
[23:17:30] <indigo> Have you considered writing your own encoder in Rust?
[23:18:20] <Brekkjern> Not really, no
[23:19:37] <Brekkjern> And why the fuck is the output video frozen at the beginning of the cut?
[23:21:22] <indigo> In all seriousness though, it might be time to get a nice NLE like DaVinci Resolve
[23:22:04] <imode> norton comes with an eth miner now?
[23:22:24] <Brekkjern> indigo: I think you are right...
[23:23:04] <Brekkjern> I have just had a lot of problems getting the output video to look good when I use Resolve
[23:23:36] *** Quits: martian67 (~martian67@user/martian67) (Remote host closed the connection)
[23:23:53] *** Joins: martian67 (~martian67@user/martian67)
[23:27:03] <indigo> Weird; does it have a shitty encoder or something?
[23:28:43] <Brekkjern> No idea
[23:29:04] <Brekkjern> I don't really know what I am doing when using it
[23:32:44] <Brekkjern> Like, I'm having trouble even importing the source files into Resolve
[23:33:01] <Brekkjern> No idea why. They just don't show up in the internal file explorer
[23:33:19] <indigo> I wonder if it just doesn't have the codecs to import it
[23:33:30] <Brekkjern> Maybe, but I should still see the files, no?
[23:35:06] <Brekkjern> Weird. I can only see files that Plex has transcoded, but not the originals
[23:35:14] <Brekkjern> In any show...
[23:40:11] <Brekkjern> Yeah. It seems it doesn't do HEVC
[23:56:53] <Brekkjern> Holy shit I hate smart installers
