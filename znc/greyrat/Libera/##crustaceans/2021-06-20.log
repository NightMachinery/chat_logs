[03:03:07] <companion_cube> quanticle: hmm, is "snipped" about cutting sensitive things? 😂
[04:00:03] <quanticle> Let's put it this way: I always knew Lua had a negative effect on your chances to procreate, but I never thought that it was this *direct*
[04:02:16] <Xe> lua is fun
[04:02:18] <Xe> so is banging
[04:02:33] <alyx> what
[04:02:46] <alyx> oh no
[04:04:16] <Xe> quanticle: does it count if you are unable to manufacture children?
[04:10:40] <companion_cube> Xe wants to show their moon
[04:12:18] <Xe> https://christine.website/blog/waifud-plans-2021-06-19 <-- something i'm probably not going to post to the site but may be interesting to y'all
[04:18:36] <quanticle> Is it bad that I'm still mad about all these weird new TLDs
[04:18:58] <quanticle> .website? wtf kind of TLD is that
[04:20:12] <alyx> one for a website
[04:20:31] <quanticle> "Essentially my vision for waifud is to be a 'middle ground' between running virtual machines on one server and something more complicated like OpenStack. I want to be able to have high level descriptions of virtual machines (including cloud-config userdata) and then hand them over to waifud to just figure out the logistics of where they should run for me."
[04:20:33] <quanticle> You're going to hate me for saying this but that does sound a lot like what Kubernetes does for containers.
[04:24:15] <Xe> quanticle: that's not actually too far off from the super high level ideas though
[04:25:43] <quanticle> Right, but logical next step in that thought process is, "Have you considered joining the Church of Docker?"
[04:26:22] <Xe> fuck docker lol
[04:26:26] <Xe> hate that shit
[04:26:48] <Xe> i've used it for like a decade now so i'm allowed to say it's garbage from how it fucks the ecosystem
[04:27:01] <quanticle> Exactly, which is why I prefaced my statement with, "You're going to hate me for saying this..."
[04:29:33] <quanticle> "Due to how absurdly useful something like this is, I also wanted to be sure that it is difficult for companies to use this in production without paying me for some kind of license. Not to say that this would be intentionally made useless, more that if I have to support people using this in production I would rather be paid to do so."
[04:29:35] <quanticle> I think the standard approach to solve this problem is to dual-license your code: if you want to use it for open-source/private use, you can do so under the GNU Affero GPL (or some other equivalent very copyleft license). Otherwise, you can pay for a license with more commercial-friendly terms.

[18:57:26] <kline> if hes a massive shitcunt thats fine but can we at least stick to accusing people of what theyre actually guilty of rather than just grabbing in everything that we hate and sticking it on them?
