[00:16:55] <one-less-time> hello once again kind people of the Internet. now i'm trying to turn this https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/emacs/org-mode.git/tree/doc/org-guide.org into Texinfo INFO file
[00:18:41] <one-less-time> so, i copied this file and doc-setup.org as well, and put them in the same directory. then i try to export org-guide.org as INFO file but it fails with `if: Missing "Version" keyword in "org.el"`. any ideas how i can fix this?
[00:19:20] <one-less-time> (i'm exporting with C-c C-e i i, C-c C-e i t produces the same error)
[00:19:25] <ngz> Oh.
[00:20:17] *** Joins: ArneBab (~quassel@freenet/release-manager/ArneBab)
[00:21:31] <ngz> Yes, {{{version}}} assumes you have a full repository.
[00:21:41] <ngz> Just replace it with, e.g., 9.6
[00:22:48] <ngz> It is only used once at the beginning of the guide (and the manual)
[00:29:31] <one-less-time> ngz: many thanks sir! indeed that was the issue

[01:59:36] <johnny_sitar> Hello. When I start emacs, M-x org-switchb returns no resulst and quits. If I open up any .org file, M-x org-switchb returns only that org file. If I open the agenda after restarting emacs, and do M-x org-switchb again, all my .org files are available. This is understandable since agenda probably needs to open a buffer for all .org files to know what to display. I've been using org-switchb as the "quick .org file switcher" but it 
[01:59:36] <johnny_sitar>  it's really not meant to do that. Should I load all .org files into buffers on startup or should I just use something else (eg. helm) for .org file switching?

[12:49:06] <Codaraxis> For example, if I have a task with   self todo!(NEXT) scheduled!("++7d")  and I mark the task DONE, it should log the state change to DONE, then to NEXT, then finally, the reschedule. However, it only logs the reschedule.

[16:38:06] <verbatim> Hello, how could I have a *truly* verbatim output from executing a source block in org-mode? I'm using ":results verbatim" which is fine for a lot of values, but not for strings: the double-quote characters are stripped.
[16:41:59] <Demosthenex> verbatim: what language src block? can you provide an example?
[16:50:48] <verbatim> Demosthenex: thanks. here is an example:
[16:50:49] <verbatim> #+BEGIN_SRC haskell :results verbatim
[16:50:49] <verbatim> "Why can't I keep my doublequotes?"
[16:50:50] <verbatim> #+END_SRC

[16:50:51] <verbatim> : Why can't I keep my doublequotes?
[16:52:57] <Demosthenex> if you ran that a cmd line, would you get quotes?
[16:53:37] <verbatim> yes
[16:53:56] <verbatim> so org is stripping the double quotes.
[16:55:25] <verbatim> So far I only noticed it with string values. It works fine with character values: they are enclosed in single quotes like this:
[16:55:25] <verbatim> #+BEGIN_SRC haskell :results verbatim

[17:18:58] <verbatim> yes
[17:20:15] <verbatim> sorry, all is find after i restarted emacs :-(
[17:20:18] <Demosthenex> so if i look at my org package in list-packages, it says i'm using 9.5.1 and that 9.4.4 is the builtin. maybe you need to goto the package and select a preference for the downloaded one

[17:25:03] <verbatim> no, it has Org mode version 9.4.6 (9.4.6-796-ge68375.dirty-elpa which i just installed.
[17:25:56] <Demosthenex> ok, so you may have to restart emacs after major changes to packages
[17:26:10] <verbatim> also files take noticeably longer to process when opening.
[17:28:15] <verbatim> let me clarify: I cannot execute code in org-mode in the new emacs process, with the latest version of org-mode that i downloaded.
[17:29:27] <verbatim> maybe a bad interaction of org libraries. i will clean up and reinstall.

[19:47:53] <corwin> Can you elaborate?  I'd be interested to know some specifics of where you have reduced your effort to configure the system by removing systemd.
[19:49:35] <corwin> (Or, if it's a matter more of works/doesn't work that would be great to understand too.  tia)
[19:49:42] <Demosthenex> corwin: gentoo global use flag -systemd.
[19:50:18] <Demosthenex> i run gentoo so i can have a minimalist OS on my laptop. i want the bare minimum installed to maintain and manage
[19:50:52] <Demosthenex> i added zfs because it's great, and i purged systemd because i don't run a desktop environment and i think it's a very bad technology
[19:52:21] <Demosthenex> i've had issues keeping gentoo up to date because i have an older laptop and recompiling is a pain. i was trying to use zfs to let me make a snapshot of my OS so i could mount it into a chroot and do the compile there in the background
[19:52:40] <Demosthenex> and while zfs worked, the linux/gentoo zfs integration is poor
[19:52:56] <Demosthenex> and linux booting with any nonstandard disk topology is incredibly fragile
[19:53:29] <Demosthenex> well, freebsd has native zfs support, no systemd, and is mostly barebones like i want
[19:53:38] <Demosthenex> hadn't tried it in years, i'm pretty hooked after a week of tinkering
[19:53:44] <corwin> so, it's more a matter of taste than having any specific benifit I would see while using/managing my system?

[20:04:44] <Demosthenex> corwin: https://forums.debian.net/viewtopic.php?t=120652
[20:10:40] <corwin> Right, thanks.  This has been around for awhile.  Is there anything new on this topic since 2015 or mostly "this one guy"?  FWIW, none of the system admins I've worked with over the last half-dozen or so years has expressed any concerns about systemd.  I'm a solution arch working in fintech, so I deal with quite a bit of infra provisioning (in terms of requesting new buildouts).
[20:12:33] <Demosthenex> corwin: i'm a intercontinental systems consultant for healthcare and finance. linux isn't a server OS anyway, and real solutions aren't built on intel.
[20:12:56] <Demosthenex> if your admins USE linux, they don't need to care much about systemd
[20:13:03] <Demosthenex> if they BUILD linux, they should care.
[20:13:58] <Demosthenex> systemd is a cancer from the desktop linux world which burrowed into the lower layers of the system. server distros should have split off from desktop distros ages ago.
[20:14:21] <Demosthenex> it's not an init system. it replaces all kinds of common unix architecture. 
[20:14:40] <Demosthenex> if it were only an init system, distro builders wouldn't have revolted.
[20:19:04] <corwin> I appreciate this is something you have expertise (and experience around); thanks for sharing your insight.  Do you have any specifics you could share?  I'm not sure what "cancer" means in this context nor why I (or my firm) should care that "it's not an init system".
[20:20:43] <Demosthenex> corwin: imagine when a desktop users wants to detect and mount a usb drive they plugged in. on unix, that requires root privs to manage devices, mount filesystems, etc. gnome had to have shims that would ask the lower levels for root authority on multiple os's. along comes systemd and decides to redo that whole chain of security with their own internal interfaces and gnome adopted it completely.
[20:21:16] <Demosthenex> now, do we want the same guy that wrote the mess of pulseaudio writing the pid 1 of your system, and replacing networking, priv'ed operations, and more with a brand new program?
[20:22:13] <tyson2> It shows that platform design is not easy even for experts, but it is easy to screw it up
[20:22:14] <Demosthenex> systemd was marketed as a replacement for sequential init startup scripts on boot. then it took over everything. device management (udev), pid 1 (init), system startup (rc.d), logind, getty, and more. now it handles logins, cron, services, etc
[20:22:36] <Demosthenex> and those people who knew those layers objected strongly
[20:23:10] <tyson2> seems like a leadership issue
[20:23:41] <Demosthenex> thing is, it made people mad because it was a leadership issue
[20:24:11] <Demosthenex> gnome suddenly says "we require systemd", and instead of pushing back or finding alternatives, every distro gutted themselves and replaced core portions of the os with systems
[20:24:14] <corwin> tyson2: s/platform//  :D
[20:24:14] <Demosthenex> systemd.
[20:24:39] <corwin> Thanks for elaborating Demosthenex
[20:24:52] <Demosthenex> so desktop linux, where a single user needs minimal security, dictated system design to all linux distros, even server ones.
[20:24:56] <Demosthenex> np
[20:25:07] <Demosthenex> corwin: as to linux not being a server OS, let me clarify.

[20:27:38] <tyson2> so what is the alternative?
[20:27:40] <Demosthenex> i think IBM's AIX and the IBM mainframe are the only solid solutions at this point.
[20:27:46] <tyson2> ok
[20:27:50] <Demosthenex> but that's high end commercial
[20:28:56] <Demosthenex> to make an analogy, windows is the plastic tricycle. linux and *BSD are dependable toyota pickup trucks, AIX is a freight train, and mainframe is a cargo ship. it's all about scale.
[20:29:22] <Demosthenex> you have to choose the right tool for the job, and often those tools don't scale
[20:29:50] <Demosthenex> you can't use a cargo ship in your back yard, and you'd be silly to haul freight across the country in 1000 toyotas instead of 1 freight train
[20:30:43] <tyson2> it seems like the way Google copes with these issues (to the extent that it does) is with massive redundancy and fault-tolerance techniques
[20:31:09] <Demosthenex> tyson2: and?
[20:31:19] <tyson2> maybe that is the right approach?
[20:31:32] <Demosthenex> tyson2: google and facebook, all the web giants, their computing environment has nothing in common with typical businesses or personal users
[20:31:47] <Demosthenex> they also pay staffs of phds to write software
[20:31:58] <corwin> Problems that can be solved with money aren't actually problems (given you have money); this Google is largely "problem free".
[20:32:03] <Demosthenex> where normal biz has to us off the shelf, and IT just maintains
[20:32:05] <corwin> s/this/thus
[20:32:13] <Demosthenex> corwin: indeed
[20:32:37] <Demosthenex> and regulatory authorities don't take away your business license if you skip a few upvotes on a post, or lost a comment on a cat video
[20:33:01] <tyson2> but business can use Google infrastructure and possibly benefit from their approach
[20:33:24] <corwin> "business license" isn't really a concept here in the United States.
[20:33:29] <Demosthenex> biz can outsource simple common tasks (ie: gmail) to them, sure.
[20:34:26] <tyson2> but aren't some rather large and complex systems hosted on GCP?
[20:34:36] <tyson2> or AWS for that matter?
[20:34:38] <Demosthenex> tyson2: other webapps with comments on cat videos.
[20:34:56] <Demosthenex> the point i'm trying to make is you're assuming a huge generalization
[20:35:09] <Demosthenex> there are many types of applications, many types of architecture
[20:35:21] <Demosthenex> and i agree, google and FB have uber-optimized the best in class to hosting webapps
[20:35:58] <Demosthenex> but i wouldn't trust lawson to code it's way out of a wet paper bag, much less write code that's safe for a distributed database
[20:36:38] <Demosthenex> and given how many of my customers require NDAs, GDPR paperwork, etc because their data is sensitive, that immediately rules out cloud solutions. the cloud = someone elses computer.
[20:36:53] <Demosthenex> and the sizes are also a problem.
[20:37:08] <tyson2> got it. there are a lot of grey areas in what GCP and AWS provide
[20:38:04] <Demosthenex> i have a customer of mine which is a hospital. every 3 years they buy a new central computer. hundreds of TBs of database, thousands of users (interactive and batch api). we build a parallell system, sync it, and are given a 30 minute outage to swap over.
[20:38:34] <Demosthenex> they even pay to have a standby server built in, so if there is an issue they are up in 5-10 min automatically
[20:38:47] <Demosthenex> imagine. linux or AWS doing 30 minutes every 3 years.
[20:38:57] <tyson2> I see what you mean
[20:39:17] <Demosthenex> imagine linux trying to remirror SAN LUNs across storage arrays in the TBs.
[20:39:58] <Demosthenex> there's a clear difference between personal computing, small biz, medium biz, and enterprise computing.

[20:49:02] <Demosthenex> tyson2: on a chipper note, ZFS is a dream. my home dir has snapshot backups every 15 min, hourly, daily, etc with sane decay rates. i can mirror my home dir to a remote server incrementally or restore it. compression, optional dedup, and built in raid instead of MD. and to top it off, bitrot protection.

[21:06:42] <Demosthenex> tyson2: that was gentoo w/ zfs and zfsautosnapshot. unless you're comfy in low level kernel configuration, i can't recommend zfs on gentoo. i hear ubuntu is starting to support it.
[21:06:58] <Demosthenex> my new box, the documentation is simple. install freebsd, setup zfs-autosnapshots

[21:27:12] <Demosthenex> tyson2: if you want to keep desktop linux, maybe consider the new ubuntu with built in zfs. then you can get snapshots ;]

[21:52:33] <corwin> I've been using snapshotting with log-shipping to sync a freenas box bi-directionally for several years; it's lovely.
