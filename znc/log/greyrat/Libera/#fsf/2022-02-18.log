[06:50:38] <DiffieHellman> People seem to have been conditioned to enjoy proprietary software and reject free software sadly.
[06:51:05] <isf> a lot of users who do reverse ingineering are from the opensource movement and they dont care about the users freedom

[07:35:06] <jacobk> If binary-only software carries a GPL license, disassembling it would make it free, right? How hard is it to take GPL binary-only firmware and convert it to readable source code?
[07:36:14] <White_Flame> complete reverse engineering is quite difficult, and firmware is often encrypted or written to unknown cpu architectures
[07:37:24] <White_Flame> I don't think GPL techincally tacitly permits you to reverse engineer it, but rather grants you the right to access the source code.  The reverse engineered code is not the actual source code it was built from

[09:07:13] <damo22> when they brought in the SMU/PSP it all changed
[09:08:01] <DiffieHellman> I believe the built in the PSP in before 2015, they just didn't enable it until 2015.
[09:08:18] <DiffieHellman> *they built in
[09:08:20] <damo22> yes the SMU was present in FAM15h
[09:08:29] <damo22> but didnt do much except power management
[09:09:10] <DiffieHellman> The PSP will be in this one?: https://libreboot.org/docs/hardware/kgpe-d16.html
[09:10:36] <DiffieHellman> I.e. in the Opteron 6282 SE ?
[09:11:55] <DiffieHellman> 3>Later SOCs include a Platform Security Processor (PSP), a small ARM processor responsible for security related measures
[09:12:09] <damo22> not sure
[09:12:21] <DiffieHellman> Hmm, it seems that the server CPU's are safe, not the latest SoC's though.
[09:13:56] <DiffieHellman> AMD never cared to really document things it seems.
[09:14:21] <damo22> DiffieHellman: https://docs.dasharo.com/variants/asus_kgpe_d16/releases/
[09:15:02] <damo22> this was funded to fix the KGPE-D16 coreboot port, its got a release there but their repo is not upstreamed into coreboot

[10:34:06] <labrador> damo22, you can get the shim code

Shippiny proprietary firmware with Linux is a GPLv2 violation, but there's no violation if the user gets Linux to load firmware from whatever as long as they don't distribute such combination.
[11:00:09] <DiffieHellman> White_Flame: There are a few pieces of binary-only firmware licensed under BSD 3-clause for example.
[11:00:34] <DiffieHellman> The source is not available, but there's no legal risk when it comes to deassembling and reimplementing.
[11:02:29] <DiffieHellman> Deassembling proprietary firmware is a risk and a massive pain. s you need to document and then

[20:34:23] <craigt> gopiandcode: Hello and welcome.
[20:35:06] <craigt> gopiandcode: There is no strict protocol. We just try and keep the topic on the FSD. I would recommend reading https://directory.fsf.org/wiki/Free_Software_Directory:Participate
[20:36:00] <craigt> gopiandcode: The meetings in general are mostly self-directed. Returning volunteers know what to do, and new comers can ask questions.
[20:36:40] <gopiandcode> ah, yes, I have done that - I have submitted a page to the FSD for Nyxt: https://directory.fsf.org/wiki?title=Nyxt&oldid=86747 and from the FSF forums, mmcmahon said the next step was to attend the FSD meetings

[20:43:49] <craigt> gopiandcode: With projects hosted on Github, the best way is use Releases. Example: https://github.com/atlas-engineer/nyxt/archive/refs/tags/2.2.4.zip

[20:44:31] <craigt> gopiandcode: Is that the same version you have cloned?
[20:44:45] <craigt> tfisgnag: Hello! Glad you could make it.

[20:46:22] <craigt> gopiandcode: OK. Let's start with a README file. 
[20:47:30] <craigt> gopiandcode: A well written README file will have information we need including licensing, copyright, program dependencies and just in general get familiar with the program you have downloaded.
[20:47:40] <tfisgnag> hwplayer and craigt : I had some problems in logging  directly into #fsf . I solved it  requesting a connection only with the net and once I got that I requested the connection with this channel.

[20:52:20] *** Joins: isf (~iShareFre@fsf/member/iShareFreedom)
[20:53:26] <gopiandcode> craigt: hmm, nyxt seems to split its readme over multiple parts - the readme at the project root provides instructions on installing and using it, but doesn't mention licensing (the project root has a separate directory called licenses which describes the licenses of the project files, and each source file has a SPDX identifier)

[21:02:49] <craigt> gopiandcode: We can also ignore any directions for non-GNU/Linux OSs.
[21:03:03] <gopiandcode> craigt: I don't think nyxt needs Emacs to run/build, but SBCL and webkitgtk are dependencies needed to build and run
[21:04:24] <gopiandcode> craigt: that's good to know - I use GNU/Linux so I hadn't read through those instructions in detail anyway

[21:05:26] <craigt> gopiandcode: So Emacs, SBCL and webkitgtk are all freely licensed.
[21:05:35] <gopiandcode> craigt: I suppose I should add Steel bank common lisp and webkit as a software prerequisite on the FSD page submission - do I use edit or edit with form to make this ammendment?

[21:08:37] <craigt> gopiandcode: Finding them first in the FSD is by far the best way to determine if they are free. I should have taken that step first.
[21:09:18] <craigt> gopiandcode: But yes, you'll want to add them to Software Prerequisites tab.
[21:09:46] <gopiandcode> craigt: what's the difference between required to use/required to build/ software dependency? I assume required to build refers to build tools like make? wheras required to use refers to runtime dependencies?

[21:11:26] <gopiandcode> what about software dependency? what does that mean? that the source _has_ to be available to build?
[21:12:38] <AwesomeAdam54321> gopiandcode: a software dependency usually refers to a runtime dependency

[21:17:15] <gopiandcode> ok, I've updated the download url to point to the release archive and added SBCL and WebkitGTK as required to use dependencies - should I save the changes, or are there more changes I should make (and if so, is it better to batch all my changes into one update or not?)

[21:21:57] <craigt> gopiandcode: I recommend downloading https://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit. It might take awhile.
[21:22:15] <gopiandcode> craigt: it doesn't seem to be linked from the readme, and not the typical COPYING or LICENSE file, but the licenses seem to be under the /licenses folder and are BSD 3-Clause for the code and CC-By-SA for non-code 
[21:24:32] <craigt> gopiandcode: typically you will find the COPYING or LICENSE files in the main directory, but the way they have done this seems fine.

[22:08:31] <isf> becouse, if dont have the 4 essencials freedoms, or are weak on it isnt free software and is nonfree/propietary
[22:08:37] <isf> Hello craigt : )
[22:08:50] <craigt> isf: permissive licenses are typically free software licenses. I can't think of any that are not.
[22:09:01] *** Quits: zleap_ (~zleap@user/zleap) (Quit: Leaving)
[22:09:15] <craigt> isf: permissive licenses give you the 4 freedoms.
[22:09:32] <isf> just the free software licenses give me the 4 freedoms of the free software
[22:10:11] <isf> a permisive license can be a nonfree license for example, but with the freedom to run the program how you with but i cant modify for example
[22:10:12] *** Quits: galex-713 (~quassel@galex-713.eu) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[22:10:28] <isf> that sound permissive, no freedom, but permissive
[22:10:59] <AwesomeAdam54321> isf: A derived version can be proprietary, but the original is free software
[22:11:07] <isf> so, if the license dont have the 4 freedoms of the free software licenses that software isnt free, and is propietary software
[22:11:40] <isf> or is white or is black in my point of view
[22:12:19] <isf> becouse, if we start to say permissive licenses and we stop to speak about free licenses, we go to stop speaking about the freedom issue

[22:12:57] <batalie> permissive licenses are free licenses. that's like saying that it isn't appropriate to say "copyleft licenses" because the word "free" isn't used
[22:12:59] <gopiandcode> craigt: now that we've gone through the copyright using scancode, should I update the copyright verified date on the FSD entry for nyxt to today?
[22:13:13] <craigt> gopiandcode: Yes.
[22:13:23] <isf> if the license of free software dont have copyleft is a weak free software license
[22:13:23] <batalie> the permissions you're granted in the word permissive are freedoms
[22:13:38] <isf> but that is like say open and not free

[22:15:53] <isf> what that mean
[22:16:03] <craigt> isf: a permissive license is a type of free software license. The label makes it easier to understand the nature of the license.
[22:16:03] <isf> permissive to what? permisive to put tivoization?
[22:16:18] <isf> permissive to put DRM on it and lose your freedom?
[22:16:28] <craigt> isf: Yes, tivoization can happen with permissive licenses.
[22:16:35] <isf> that dont sound as a permissive, that sound as a weakness
[22:16:37] <hwpplayer1> Yes
[22:16:37] <batalie> no, permissive in that it grants you more permissions than a copyleft license
[22:16:44] <craigt> isf: Yes again. That is a concern.

[22:17:15] <isf> that sound as a weakness, if the license have a point for lose the freedom of the license give, that sound as a weakness not as a permission
[22:17:36] <batalie> i'm not saying it's *good* that it grants you more permissions, but don't pretend that permissive licenses aren't free
[22:17:40] <craigt> gopiandcode: Looking good!
[22:17:55] <isf> i recommend say "weak free license" if the license is a free software license but dont have copyleft.
[22:18:29] <isf> becouse the copyleft is a defense for the freedom of the users
[22:18:41] <isf> if you dont have copyleft, isnt a permission, is a lose of defense against the DRM

[23:29:55] <vitali64[m]> Hi
[23:30:20] <fsdbot> The Free Software Directory meeting stops now. If it is your first time joining us, please check out the participation guide: https://directory.fsf.org/wiki/Free_Software_Directory:Participate
[23:30:26] <leah> i use it a lot. i'm not surprised it isn't listed. it's a very obscure software
[23:30:35] <craigt> There's the bot, and that's a wrap! Thanks everybody!
[23:30:40] <vitali64[m]> Seen/learn aren't in the free software directory
[23:30:48] * craigt is looking at openboardview
[23:30:55] <leah> craigt: https://openboardview.org/
[23:31:00] <vitali64[m]> Oh, I'm late :(
[23:31:52] <craigt> leah: Expat, nice. It should be reviewed for the FSD.
[23:32:04] <craigt> vitali64[m]: Hello. So sorry, but we just wrapped up.
[23:32:19] <vitali64[m]> :(
[23:32:34] <craigt> There is always next week. Did you have a specific question?
[23:32:43] <vitali64[m]> Yeah
[23:33:07] <craigt> vitali64[m]: What's up? I can hang out for a few more minutes.
[23:33:18] <vitali64[m]> I'm the author of both seen and learn and would love to have them listed in the Free Software Directory
[23:33:46] <vitali64[m]> They're licensed under the GPLv3
[23:33:54] <vitali64[m]> Seen is a blog generator
[23:34:17] <vitali64[m]> Used @ vitali64.gitlab.io/articles
[23:34:29] <vitali64[m]> And learn is a documentation generator

[23:35:37] <Guest57> Hello FSF
[23:35:46] <vitali64[m]> Hi
[23:36:16] <Guest57> What do you all think of the EU Public License thing-y
[23:36:18] <craigt> vitali64[m]: Have you read https://directory.fsf.org/wiki/Free_Software_Directory:Participate ?
[23:36:22] <Guest57> no
[23:36:27] <vitali64[m]> No
[23:37:21] <Guest57> Should I read that
[23:37:24] <craigt> vitali64[m]: That would be the place to start for adding your programs.
[23:37:38] <craigt> Guest57: If you want to learn how to contribute to the Free Software Directory, then yes.

[23:38:05] <leah> ok craigt i've submitted openboardview
[23:38:10] <Guest57> Ok so I don't need to
[23:38:12] <craigt> vitali64[m]: I'd be glad to help, but I can only offer my time during the meetings.
[23:38:18] <craigt> leah: Nice! Thank you.
[23:38:21] <leah> i could probably dig deeper and list a few extra things like irc channels and such. but i've added a basic entry for it

[23:38:58] <leah> i usually miss fsd meetings. at least i was only 5 minutes late to this one
[23:39:13] <Guest57> FSF meetings?
[23:39:18] <leah> fsd is a great resource
[23:39:23] <leah> Guest57: fsd. free software directory
[23:39:29] <leah> it's a database of software
[23:39:37] <leah> https://directory.fsf.org/wiki/Main_Page
[23:39:42] <isf> how i can translate to spanish this page of the directoty: https://directory.fsf.org/wiki/Free_Software_Directory:Participate
[23:39:47] <Guest57> (y)
[23:39:55] <leah> every week, the fsf holds a meeting here on irc to review new entries and update old ones
[23:39:57] <craigt> leah: Technically, you were 5 minutes early to the end of the meeting. :)
[23:40:19] <leah> openboardview is amazing btw
[23:40:21] <leah> i use it every day
[23:40:24] <Guest57> Literally here?
[23:40:25] <Guest57> Should I leave
[23:40:33] <craigt> Guest57: No, the meeting is over.
[23:40:35] <leah> ok have fun everyone. i was just stopping by
[23:40:47] <craigt> Guest57: If it was still going, I'd invite you to stay. :)
[23:40:56] <craigt> leah: Take care.
[23:41:47] <craigt> isf: I'm actually not sure what the protocol is for translating the FSD. Please email directory@fsf.org with your offer and we'll see what we can do.
[23:41:55] <craigt> isf: Thank you.
[23:42:08] <isf> on my way!
[23:42:18] <leah> no matter what else happens in the world, no matter who's who and what's what, one thing is constant:
[23:42:27] <leah> directory meetings every friday
[23:42:40] <craigt> vitali64[m]: I'm sorry I couldn't be more of service at this time. Please look over the Participate page and see if it helps.

[23:50:34] <leah> i'll let clever add that to fsd if he so chooses
[23:50:53] <leah> craigt: i think you should mention it on fsf pages pertaining to raspberry pi
[23:51:12] <leah> it's pretty much most of the way there, on up to rpi 3b+
[23:51:30] <leah> hdmi doesn't work yet, but you can get a "vga666" adapter for using an external monitor
[23:51:56] <leah> librerpi does to rpi what libreboot does to a thinkpad x200. it's worth a look. hell, fsf could probably use rpi's now in their office
[23:52:51] <leah> clever is also seeing what's what on rpi4/400. i'm told raminit is one of the biggest hurdles on the newer rpi
