[05:58:58] <Guest253> I want to setup something like btcpayserver/cypherpunkpay locally and don't want to have to download the entire blockchain so I can start coding. Is this possible to do without downloading the whole blockchain?
[05:59:09] <buZz> Guest253: the latter doesnt exist
[05:59:31] <Guest253> So I need to download the whole blockchain just so I could do stuff with testnet?
[06:00:12] <buZz> ? testnet is a different chain, obviously
[06:00:32] <Guest253> Yes I don't want to test locally with the entire mainnet chain with live coins
[06:00:48] <buZz> i dont get what you're asking

[22:47:14] <Guest72> The password for the wallet is crucial, as well as some dynamic passwords that I record in my notebook by handwriting
[22:47:27] <Guest72> This is a very good suggestion
[22:47:50] <earnestly> Bear in mind that the wallet password doesn't encrypt it, just makes the password necessary for certain priviledged operations with it
[22:48:48] <earnestly> I do wish mnemonics would become usable with one standard for all wallets :(
[22:48:58] <specing> Guest72: coinbase fees are too high
[22:49:19] <earnestly> There is a certain beauty to the idea that many bitcoin operations can be done without a computer at all
[22:49:32] <earnestly> specing: Apparently the pro. version is better
[22:50:22] <Guest72> coinbase does cost a bit more, but it's safer! As this is the only listed company, I'd rather enjoy some security as opposed to a small fee wouldn't I?
[22:50:35] <Victorsueca> Coinbase Pro is exactly the same but with lower fees
[22:51:04] <Victorsueca> In fact, if you already have a Coinbase account you don't even need to create a new one for Coinbase Pro
[22:51:33] <specing> earnestly: still too high
[22:51:42] <earnestly> Yeah, apparently just pro.coinbase.com and login there
[22:52:02] <specing> FTX fees seem to be 0.02%, 25 times lower than coinbase pro

[22:53:57] <Guest72> But the coinbase wallet defi program is great and you can use this to offset your payment amount

[23:01:18] <Guest72> This doesn't take a lot of time, the problem with Bitcoin now is that its old algorithm makes its transactions slow, so most of the calculations are now done in ETH

Right wing fascist dictators become "bitcoin
