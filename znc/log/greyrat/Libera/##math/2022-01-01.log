[05:25:57] <Arcorann> I can take a look, but I'll need a few minutes to remember how separable ODEs work
[05:27:01] <eviroo> Well, the confusing part is why they use ln(2-y) instead of ln(y-2) in the steps, you can take a look here: https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=y’%2F%28y%5E2+-+2y%29+%3D+1%2Fx

[05:30:47] <Arcorann> 1/(y^2 - 2y) = 1/2(1/(y-2) - 1/(y)), so integrating both sides gives 1/2(ln|y-2|-ln|y|) = ln|x| + c as mentioned before

[07:14:28] <jodmos> [itchyjunk] i'm not willing to disclose my identity. so I can't publish on the arxiv. doesn't allow anonymity. I know that it is unknown because 1. never seen it 2. never seen the situation adressed 3. methods used are extensions of topos theoretic methods that have never been extended beyond topoi, which is what I did. Emailed professors. One
[07:14:28] <jodmos> seems mildly interested. But I do not believe he takes me very seriously. And he's more Computer Science, whereas I'm more pure maths, so there is this gap... And I do not pray.
[07:15:47] <[itchyjunk]> there is very very places that lets you publish anynomously
[07:16:12] <jodmos> [itchyjunk] and most people I attempt to contact are either not interested, or they died in the last ten years.
[07:16:36] <[itchyjunk]> you could anynomously mail it to someone and hope they publish it
[07:16:49] <[itchyjunk]> anynomously mail it to 10 peopl
[07:17:49] <jodmos> [itchyjunk] if someone is willing to publish under his name on arxiv and mention inside that is my proof with a pseudonym, I'd be fine. I did mention the result by result to some people. Never replied. I believe they do not get the context. So I do not hope: I conclude they do not get it.
[07:18:16] <jodmos> did mention the result by email.
[07:19:08] <[itchyjunk]> probably 1% of the world population cares about category theory
[07:19:17] <[itchyjunk]> probably half of the read papers
[07:19:29] <[itchyjunk]> probably half of those understand enough to verify papers
[07:19:41] <jodmos> [itchyjunk] and I need help to put it on paper. Some to read it to keep the text streamlined and intelligible. Which would motivate me a bit, as I'm too sick to be spontaneously motivated.
[07:19:46] <bosspotato> 1% is very generous
[07:20:02] <abcits123[m]> I was thinking the same thing
[07:20:04] <mycroftiv> yeah i think more like 1% of 1%
[07:20:37] <[itchyjunk]> well, i don't see a lot of option for you to stay anynomous and also half it credited to your pseudonym
[07:20:41] <Z-module> I just looked at a 50ish-page paper from 1996 proving an old conjecture that the middle binomial coefficient C(2n,n) is non-squarefree for all n > 4.  Quite a lot of work. But at least it does have all sorts of sideline things along the way.
[07:20:52] <[itchyjunk]> maybe just hold on to it and after you die, someone will discover it and publish it under your name
[07:21:08] <jodmos> [itchyjunk] I want to remain anonymous because I had... problems.

[10:25:39] <jodmos> Ismlckzl there's a paper by Di Longo before he switched off from maths to medical philosophy about such proofs that allow to bypass the usage of induction in proof assistants. Gauss' summation is one such. This one is another. I believe there is a wider phenomenon tied to the enumeration of some equivalence classes, but that's another topic.

[17:17:09] <cherim> You can get 112 already from 2arcsin(7/x)+2arcsin(58/x)+2arcsin(92/x)==Pi
[17:19:05] <cherim> For a human to find 112 it's probably easiest to say that triangles with sides (x, 7, sqrt(x^2-7^2)) and (58, 92, sqrt(x^2-7^2)) have cosA = -cosB for A+B=Pi
[17:19:38] <cherim> Then -7/x = (58^2+92^2+7^2-x^2)/(2*58*92) which has a root x=112 and two negative ones

[20:03:31] <[itchyjunk]> If I have (\x.M)(E), shouldn't it just reduce to M ?
[20:03:43] <isekaijin> [itchyjunk]: Only assuming that x does not appear free in M.
[20:03:50] <[itchyjunk]> but for beta-reduction, it reduced to M[x := E] which i don't get
[20:03:55] <isekaijin> [itchyjunk]: Otherwise, you have to substitute the free occurrences of x in M with E.
[20:04:00] <[itchyjunk]> ah
[20:04:14] <[itchyjunk]> Okay, that wasn't mentioned in wiki
[20:04:18] <[itchyjunk]> that makes more sense

[20:14:58] <isekaijin> Yeah, the solution to an initial value problem (IVP = ODE + initial condition) is always a curve.

[20:35:37] <cadmio> and those two cases are exhaustive for all possibilities?
[20:36:06] <Z-module> I read over the full proof again that a nontrivial normal subgroup of A_n (n >= 5) must contain at least one 3 cycle. It's totally elementary but rather elaborate. I can barely believe they would give that as homework.
[20:37:01] <cadmio> if you look here https://imgur.com/ftX6MHI.png you find even more cases
[20:39:42] <buster> cadmio, Case 1 is excluded by hypothesis (it doesn't move more than three elements). Case 2 is included in case (a). Case 3 is excluded. Case 4 is included in case (2).

[21:00:10] <Z-module> then you reach a contradiction, so alpha actually moves only three symbols, so it must be a single 3-cycle.
[21:00:51] <cadmio> for example the 3-cycle (abc) moves 3 symbols and leaves fixed the other n-3
[21:00:56] <Z-module> right

[21:06:28] <Z-module> and alpha can't move *exactly* four symbols in the first  case, because that would force alpha to have the form (a b c d)  which is not even (not in A_n ).

[21:26:40] <Z-module> Everything in N \ {e} moves at least three symbols (moving only two is a single transposition, not even). So each thing leaves at most n - 3 symbols fixed. For each beta in N \ {e}, let fix(beta) = the number of symbols beta leaves fixed, which is at most n - 3.  So some fix(...) value here is maximal, among all beta in N \ {e}, and we let alpha be anything where fix(alpha) is that maximum, which is at most n - 3.  Then we prove by
[21:26:41] <Z-module> contradicition that it actually *is* n - 3, by assuming now it is at most n - 4 meaning alpha moves at least 4 symbols.
[21:28:13] <Z-module> The idea is that if fix(alpha) = n - 3, then alpha moves exactly 3 symbols, and the only way it can do that is to be a single 3-cycle.

[21:57:07] <Z-module> cadmio:  They way they have chosen notation, alpha itself definitely moves the symbol 1 (1 is not fixed by alpha).  They observe that both  alpha   and   beta alpha beta^-1    have all the same fixed symbols k with k > 5, and so does alpha^-1 (any permutation moves the exact same symbols as its inverse), thus the full    alpha^-1 beta alpha beta^-1    still has all those same fixed symbols k > 5.  But now   alpha^-1 beta alpha beta^-1
[21:57:07] <Z-module> *also* fixes either 1 or 2, as well, which alpha dose not.  So   alpha^-1 beta alpha beta^-1   has strictly more fixed symbols than alpha alone does, contrary to the choice of alpha.

[23:25:51] <riv> you start with 15/8
[23:26:00] <riv> that's the same as (8 * 1 + 7)/8
[23:26:10] <Guest1778> agreed
[23:26:16] <riv> and you can simplify that to 1 + 7/8
[23:26:24] <Guest1778> agreed
[23:26:35] <riv> this is the first step
[23:26:37] <Guest1778> oh so that means 8 "goes into 15" once
[23:26:39] <riv> another example is, 26/8
[23:26:47] <riv> you can write that as (8*3 + 2)/8
[23:26:48] <Guest1778> the 7/8 is what remains
[23:26:52] <riv> which simplifies to 3 + 2/8

[23:28:36] <int-e> Guest1778: Note that 0 <= 7/8 < 1, so 1 is the integer part of 15/8. Now to find the next decimal digit, note that 0.1*10 = 1, so we can find the integer part of 7/8*10 instead, so we continue by dividing 70 by 8
[23:28:45] <riv> what if we had 40/8, that's 5 + 0/8
[23:28:47] <int-e> (no idea why riv changed examples :-/ )
[23:29:08] <riv> now, 20/8 = 2.5
[23:29:19] <riv> notice they are the numbers that came out [2] and [5]
[23:32:08] <Guest1778> where does the 0.1 come from inte?

[23:33:27] <int-e> Simplar: because there are fewer isosceles triangles to deal with before you hit a known angle

[23:34:24] <int-e> Guest1778: it's the value of the digit immediately after the decimal point: 0.7 equals 0.1*7
[23:34:37] <int-e> "value", maybe "weight"
[23:34:40] <riv> 0.1?
[23:34:50] <int-e> Guest1778: 10^(-1)
[23:35:27] <Guest1778> okay, but how does that relate to 7/8 ? 0.7 means 7/10
[23:35:47] <int-e> 0.7 was just an example
[23:35:51] <Guest1778> oh oh oh
[23:36:44] <int-e> maybe a better way to explain the idea here is that multiplying by 10 shifts the decimal point, so the digit after the decimal point becomes the digit immediately preceding the decimal point
[23:37:21] <Guest1778> makes sense. That reminds me of how our number system works for base 10
[23:37:54] <int-e> if you have a formal definition of what a decimal expansion means (which real number it represents) you can derive it from that... but at the level where long division is introduced that is usually lacking.
[23:39:38] *** Joins: qeed_ (~qeed@072-190-106-143.res.spectrum.com)
[23:39:44] <int-e> So after multiplying by 10, we look at 70/8 = 8 + 6/8, so 8 is our next digit. And then we shift (multiply by 10) again...
[23:41:05] <Guest1778> Okay

[23:42:09] <riv> thats a great way to explain it
[23:42:30] <riv> do find 3 decimal places of 7/8 we can just do 700/8
[23:42:35] <riv> and put the . in the right place at the ned
[23:43:04] *** Joins: a0z1 (~a0z1@194.37.96.104)
[23:44:49] <Guest1778> so when do we stop?
[23:45:16] <int-e> And btw the same kind of shifting happens when you divide a large integer by a small one: When dividing 9000 by 7, you start with 9/7 = 1 + 2/7 to get the thousands digit (weight 10^3). And then we look at 20/7 to get the next one (weight 10^2 = 100), and so on. This produces increasingly good approximations of 9000/7 in decimal: 1000, then 1200, 1280, 1285, and if you like, the decimal expansion...
[23:45:22] <int-e> ...as well: 1285.7, 1285.71, 1285.714, at which point the digits start repeating: 285714285714... forever.
[23:45:47] <int-e> When dividing by 8 you will reach remainder 0, so that's where you stop.

[23:46:49] <int-e> For repeating digits... it depens; you can detect and indicate the period, or just call it a day when you have enough digits for your purpose. Or just don't bother with the decimal expansion and work with the original fraction instead (an art that many people forget :-/ )
