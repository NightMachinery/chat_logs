[02:07:24] <Toadisattva> hi amigojapan :D
[02:07:26] <amigojapan> Good morning
[02:08:55] <amigojapan> Hi Toadisattva 
[02:09:13] <amigojapan> Still quite early here
[02:10:56] <amigojapan> Toadisattva: today I am going to stay 2 days at the town of the cram school
[02:11:21] <Toadisattva> staying in a hotel?
[02:11:39] <amigojapan> Yes
[02:11:59] <amigojapan> Hotels are still cheap cause of Corona
[02:13:31] <amigojapan> Will be fun
[02:14:01] <amigojapan> Toadisattva: this is the first time we go so far since Corona
[02:14:22] <amigojapan> Thanks to the vaccine
[02:14:25] <Toadisattva> oh nice cheap hotel ftw
[02:14:35] <Toadisattva> is your wife going as well?
[02:14:42] <amigojapan> Yes
[02:14:57] <amigojapan> I can't leave her home alone
[02:16:35] <amigojapan> I find it hard to even leave her home alone for the same day, she is usually upset by the time I come back
[02:19:54] <amigojapan> Toadisattva: you know hotels usually charge per person in Japan, and not per room?
[02:21:11] <amigojapan> We got 2 nights for 70usd per person which includes breakfast. Which is really cheap for Japan
[02:21:27] <amigojapan> Fire both nights
[02:22:34] <amigojapan> Usually it is about double that
[02:24:35] <amigojapan> Toadisattva: hostels are much cheaper than that in Tokyo. But there are no hostels in the town I am staying at
[02:26:40] <Toadisattva> 2 nights for $70 is great
[02:26:51] <Toadisattva> you can't even get one night most places in the states for that
[02:27:00] *** Joins: Enyo (Enyo@gateway/vpn/protonvpn/enyo)
[02:27:36] <amigojapan> Toadisattva: in Tokyo you can still get a dormitory room for about 30usd per person. Altho those are shutting down like dying flies with Corona they have no business
[02:28:07] <Toadisattva> yeah corona has been really rough on small business
[02:28:15] <amigojapan> Yup
[02:28:45] <amigojapan> Especially anything to do with international travel
[02:29:16] <Toadisattva> are they blocking all international travel there still?
[02:29:26] <amigojapan> Yes
[02:29:38] <Toadisattva> that's no good
[02:29:45] <ButterNoodle> gotta keep the gaijin down
[02:29:46] <amigojapan> Right
[02:30:43] <amigojapan> Toadisattva: they are only allowing it for people with family in Japan and even then you need to get a PCR test and have a 2 week quarantine
[02:31:11] <Toadisattva> wow they are serious about it
[02:31:20] <amigojapan> Yup
[02:32:15] <Toadisattva> hopefully things level out in the next year or two
[02:32:39] <Toadisattva> I got plans to visit!
[02:32:43] <amigojapan> Yeah when most people get the vaccine
[02:32:58] <Toadisattva> guess its more time save up for a better seat on the plane
[02:33:06] <Toadisattva> how is the vax rate there?
[02:33:29] <amigojapan> Toadisattva: Japan started really slow, but has now exceeded the percentage of vaccinated people in the US
[02:33:49] <Toadisattva> nice!
[02:34:15] <Toadisattva> I guess that's to be expected though people in Japan are a lot smarter than people in the US generally lol 
[02:34:19] <amigojapan> Toadisattva: I checked a few days ago it was 61 precent and still growing steadily
[02:34:26] <Toadisattva> not bad at all
[02:34:46] <Toadisattva> or I guess I should probably say a lot less selfish, a lot more considerate, etc
[02:34:52] <ButterNoodle> japanese people are more inclined to do what everyone else is doing
[02:35:08] <ButterNoodle> instead of being unique and special snowflakes
[02:35:13] <Toadisattva> all the cool kids are doing it 
[02:35:20] <ButterNoodle> butt stuff?
[02:36:11] <Toadisattva> isn't butt stuff mandatory since like 2017?
[02:36:17] <ButterNoodle> is it?
[02:36:49] <amigojapan> There is this guy from Russia in another channel, that said he thought he may die from the vaccine, and right now he is in the hospital with severe covid condition
[02:36:57] <Toadisattva> yeah pretty sure pornhub lobbied congress or something
[02:37:02] <ButterNoodle> from the vaccine?
[02:37:33] <ButterNoodle> woah.. I am out of compliance Toadisattva.. I need to do more butt stuff
[02:37:49] <Toadisattva> you degenerate!
[02:37:51] <ButterNoodle> hey Toadisattva..
[02:38:01] <ButterNoodle> u want to do some butt stuff later?
[02:38:03] <ButterNoodle> or even now?
[02:38:35] * Toadisattva gets the beads
[02:38:46] <ButterNoodle> Toadisattva: ever have a lawnmower?
[02:39:18] <Toadisattva> uh oh
[02:39:22] <amigojapan> Toadisattva: juzu beads? :)

[02:40:59] <ButterNoodle> yea I dont have it on my bot in the other channel either
[02:43:35] <Toadisattva> no ud lookup?

[06:39:59] <MootPoot> in my circles minecraft is a regular entry in the revolving door of games
[06:40:13] <MootPoot> every year we'll play MC as the main game for like 2-3 months
[06:40:14] <klaxa> i never got warm with minecraft
[06:40:24] <MootPoot> then something will happen, or somebody will stop playing regularly
[06:40:28] <Matt|home> god there _is_ a game i want to play.. but the gameplay _itself_ and a few game designs are atrocious
[06:40:31] <MootPoot> and then back into the shelf it goes
[06:40:45] <Matt|home> but it's core gameplay element is you get to code reality around you, which is awesome
[06:40:50] <klaxa> but isn't it fine like that?
[06:41:19] <klaxa> i barely play a game constantly, it's always bursts
[06:41:25] <Matt|home> but my god so many things about it drive me crazy.. overlapping text bubbles, 3d top down isometric viewing which means you have to memorize the city layout, CONSTANTLY going to parties to progress the plot
[06:41:38] <Matt|home> it had the potential to be EPIC
[06:42:29] <Matt|home> but it just bugs me

[18:11:26] <SpiritOfSummer> especially #politics
[18:11:27] <tsukkin> bco1981 there is no way for someone as isolated as me to get it 
[18:11:33] <ButterNoodle> %50 of whats wrong with the world rite there
[18:11:52] <tsukkin> i am not going to just randomly give myself covid 
[18:11:58] <SpiritOfSummer> lol right
[18:12:06] <KatrinValerie> tsukkin: do you live that far away from other people?
[18:12:31] <KatrinValerie> It can spread through apartment buildings without direct contact, depending on how the building is built 
[18:12:32] <MootPoot> tsukkin: I mean, you're still going to be in contact with humans at some point in the future, and I assume you dot aquire 100% of your food/water/stuff alone 
[18:12:36] <MootPoot> so....
[18:12:44] <MootPoot> as long as you're tied into human society in some way
[18:12:59] <S_T_A_N> SpiritOfSummer, I don't want to be liked by the likes of you. Facts are facts and your brand of willful ignorance is literally killing people and keeping this shit going longer.

[18:13:49] <S_T_A_N> You aren't willing to 
[18:13:50] <ButterNoodle> literally unbalanced level of chromosomes to think that the un vaccinated are responsible for the vaccinated getting covid.. could it be that the vaccine is not as effective as we are lead to believe?
[18:13:52] <S_T_A_N> but you could

[18:14:30] <ButterNoodle> :)
[18:14:33] <tsukkin> things get delivered to me and sterilized
[18:14:35] <ButterNoodle> u decide
[18:14:39] <ButterNoodle> tsukkin: lol
[18:14:40] <S_T_A_N> Either way it's not a joke
[18:14:41] <Bco1981> many forget that the vaccine isn't a cure, it just helps make it not as bad as it could have been. it does not protect you 100%.
[18:14:43] <MootPoot> ButterNoodle: afaik the issue is not the unvaccinated are spreading it to the vaccinated, its that the unvaccinated are clogging up our hospitals and creating variants
[18:15:03] <KatrinValerie> Your general risk with the vaccine is just way lower
[18:15:06] <MootPoot> tsukkin: I guess if you trust the sterilization, go for it
[18:15:18] <ButterNoodle> KatrinValerie: true.. you get it
[18:15:20] <MootPoot> speaking of
[18:15:29] <tsukkin> mootpoot been working for the past 2 decades so not sure why this would be any different
[18:15:36] <KatrinValerie> The odds are so much in favour of the vaccine
[18:16:00] <MootPoot> ButterNoodle: do you have a pelican cooler? are those off brand rotomoulded coolers as good or no
[18:16:02] <KatrinValerie> And even seemingly mild cases of covid can lead to long covid
[18:16:12] <KatrinValerie> which is far less likely with the vaccine 
[18:16:13] <MootPoot> I've been eying igloo brand roto coolers
[18:16:24] <MootPoot> will covid make my cock longer
[18:16:30] <ButterNoodle> tsukkin: and covid cant live on boxes, deliveries, your pet hampster, or apparently 6ft away from someone with the virus..
[18:16:37] <ButterNoodle> MootPoot: no.. too damn expensive
[18:16:39] <KatrinValerie> And if you are around people with a weakend immune system it is also vital to protect them
[18:16:52] <tsukkin> butternoodle that sounds inaccurate 
[18:16:56] <ButterNoodle> KatrinValerie: like I've said all along.. manage your risk
[18:17:01] <ButterNoodle> tsukkin: its pretty accurate
[18:17:08] <SpiritOfSummer> I think the entire world could be a little bit more conspiracy friendly
[18:17:10] <ButterNoodle> and sarcastic
[18:17:16] <SpiritOfSummer> obviously no too much, but there's a lot that not enough people pay attention to
[18:17:18] <S_T_A_N> You manage your risk by getting the damn vaccine 
[18:17:23] <SpiritOfSummer> the timeline of events speaks English to me.

[18:17:57] <KatrinValerie> No need to make up conspiracies, there are enough real ones out there
[18:18:07] <SpiritOfSummer> S_T_A_N: the dumbest thing /you've/ ever read
[18:18:16] <KatrinValerie> Eg the rich stuffing their pockets without paying the proper amount of taxes
[18:18:25] <SpiritOfSummer> taking place in an individually perceived universe
[18:18:27] <tsukkin> oh oh i have a fun conspiracy theory
[18:18:36] <SpiritOfSummer> with many perspectives completley unaffected by your own
[18:18:38] <ButterNoodle> godlikeproductions
[18:18:48] <KatrinValerie> Like there is some serious spy movie shit going on in europe
[18:19:31] <tsukkin> you guys know somewhere between 600 thousand and 1 million people go missing without a trace in the united states ?
[18:19:39] <SpiritOfSummer> yeah it's weird
[18:19:50] <tsukkin> okay so here is the theory
[18:19:58] <tsukkin> they go missing into cave systems that exist under the ground
[18:20:02] <tsukkin> and migrate north to alaska 
[18:20:03] <MootPoot> who has the money for a pelican cooler
[18:20:04] <ButterNoodle> tsukkin: they are abducted by yum brands and turned into pepperoni and taco meat
[18:20:06] <MootPoot> is my question
[18:20:08] <SpiritOfSummer> alright this is a bit crazy
[18:20:13] <KatrinValerie> is that figure every year or total?
[18:20:15] <SpiritOfSummer> how do people go underground through all of canada

[18:21:03] <SpiritOfSummer> ominous
[18:21:12] <tsukkin> people disappear and go to live in tunnel systems underneath alaska 
[18:21:23] <tsukkin> and sometimes the alaskan mole people kidnap naughty children 
[18:21:23] <darkwitch> ButterNoodle, I never thought about it that way, but you may be right
[18:21:30] <SpiritOfSummer> oh you mean the tunnels are in alaska, I thought you meant that's how they get there
[18:21:35] <SpiritOfSummer> tsukkin; where did you hear this
[18:21:35] <ButterNoodle> or they cut open a polar bear and use it like a tonton
[18:21:45] <tsukkin> spiritofsummer from an alaskan mole person 
[18:21:50] <SpiritOfSummer> alright well
[18:21:52] <ButterNoodle> its like a bionic mecha
[18:22:01] <listenurs> sounds like an escape plot
[18:22:05] <KatrinValerie> The vast majority of missing persons cases are resolved relatively quickly. For example, in 2012, there were 661,000 missing persons cases reported; more than 659,000 of them were resolved within a year.
[18:22:12] <SpiritOfSummer> I hope they don't get fucked by an Alaskan bull worm

[18:24:09] <tsukkin> i agree with s_t_a_n 
[18:24:19] <darkwitch> amigojapan, the government is making the earthquakes happen
[18:24:19] <KatrinValerie> What are their interests, do they have any political bias and so on
[18:24:34] <KatrinValerie> After that comes checking for verifyable sources
[18:24:34] <tsukkin> are earthquakes at all caused by humans ?
[18:24:40] <ButterNoodle> tsukkin: what are you exactly agreeing with?
[18:24:53] <SpiritOfSummer> tsukkin: about me? you understand we kind of agree about what he was saying right lol
[18:24:56] <SpiritOfSummer> that' ssomewhat contradictory
[18:24:59] <tsukkin> refusing to get vaccinated is harmful to society 
[18:25:02] <S_T_A_N> tsukkin, then regardless of if you see other people or not, get the vaccine 
[18:25:13] <ButterNoodle> tsukkin: yes they moved the HAARP project to an underground facility to cause deep earth disturbances and control the weather
[18:25:16] <SpiritOfSummer> very forceful
[18:25:20] <tsukkin> that would just be me taking it away from someone who actually needs it

[18:26:28] <amigojapan> Hey MootPoot 
[18:26:29] <SpiritOfSummer> because you seemed to kind of contradict yourself
[18:26:36] <ButterNoodle> ^
[18:26:38] <SpiritOfSummer> regardless good luck with the alaskan people
[18:26:46] <tsukkin> as someone who never has contact with other people i find it pointless to get vaccinated 
[18:26:56] <tsukkin> i do not believe that to be the case for people who actually live lives around other people
[18:26:57] <KatrinValerie> SpiritOfSummer: basically they dont need it for themselves because they are isolated is what they said
[18:26:59] <ButterNoodle> good luck with finding cute girls in alaska
[18:27:06] <KatrinValerie> but people who do interact with others should get vaccinated
[18:27:07] <tsukkin> there are cute girls in alaska
[18:27:20] <KatrinValerie> I personally would get vacced just in case you get another medical emergency tsukkin 
[18:27:22] <ButterNoodle> 10:1
[18:27:27] <SpiritOfSummer> KatrinValerie: why is it that there's a new shot every 6 months for it?
[18:27:27] <tsukkin> most people who go missing actually happen to be cute girls
[18:27:32] <SpiritOfSummer> how long would that last?
[18:27:34] <KatrinValerie> Think about it, what if you cannot avoid getting help from other people
[18:27:37] <tsukkin> there are boosters for a lot of vaccines 
[18:27:37] <ButterNoodle> man to woman ratio
[18:27:50] <tsukkin> butternoodle that excludes the mole people though
[18:27:53] <ButterNoodle> one booster a week
[18:27:58] <MootPoot> I prefer a 1:5 man to woman ratio
[18:28:02] <KatrinValerie> SpiritOfSummer: we are just begining to understand how long the immunity lasts
