[13:50:58] <Faux> whaht
[13:51:09] <Renderwww> exactly my reaction
[13:51:44] <Faux> Do condom nipples mean you don't need censorship?
[13:53:02] <Renderwww> maybe it's the international version, or nipples don't have to be pixelated, or they changed the law
[13:53:07] <Renderwww> nobody know it?
[13:53:17] <Faux> I need you to do the needful.
[13:53:27] <jotham> i haven't been to law school to study international japanese sexual censorship law
[13:53:47] <jotham> SOMEONE MUST HAVE
[13:54:04] <Renderwww> that one person probably only speaks in boxlang
[13:54:21] <Carbonflux> "Plenty of status effects included!"
[13:55:21] <jotham> miss takahashi, the court has ruled that your son did in fact 'smash one out' to an illegal image of a girl with a shoe in her cunt.
[13:55:31] <Faux> It's rather expensive. I guess there was a lot of art.
[13:56:49] <Renderwww> steamdb says there is a demo, so if you are bold you can try it
[13:57:10] <Renderwww> in deutschbagland the store page doesn't load, we need to be protected
[13:57:20] <Faux> Wouldn't surprise me if it was illegal here, not that those laws are enforced afaik.
[13:57:44] <jotham> still bizarre to me rimworld got banned in aussie
[13:58:11] <jotham> i mean for years NZ used to adopt AU censorship law, cause it was cheaper than doing it ourselves, but the problem is they are a lot more racist, conservative, and christian than we are
[13:58:14] <jotham> so we had to decouple
[13:58:28] <Faux> Heh, here I can see the bundle page, but all of the titles are "excluded".
[13:58:29] <Renderwww> what's the reason it was banned?
[13:58:30] <Faux> https://store.steampowered.com/bundle/21648/
[13:58:44] <jotham> Renderwww: technicality around console classification 
[13:58:52] <Renderwww> that link goes directly to the store front for me
[13:58:57] <Faux> Haha, the removal of the censorship is DLC.
[13:59:05] <jotham> https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/294100/view/3128317860018980463

[14:06:22] <jotham> HORSE
[14:06:33] <jotham> wish i could play horse
[14:06:40] <jotham> really am gonna end up just getting a ps5 at this rate
[14:06:50] <jotham> be nice to just build a new wintendo though
[14:18:30] <jotham> what's the gpu like in the steamdeck Renderwww 
[14:18:40] <jotham> lots of my indie games all got patched for it over the last few days
[14:19:01] <jotham> wonder if it has better single core performance than my i7 3770k
[14:27:13] <Faux> Doubt it. There's a lot of performance at the inefficient end of those i7s.
[14:33:24] <Carbonflux> Our mask mandate expired tonight :)
[14:33:36] <Carbonflux> some people were burning them.
[14:34:33] <Carbonflux> its an APU, made specifically for the Steam deck.
[14:59:08] <T`aZ> low power cpu ftw
[15:13:00] <Renderwww> jotham: people comared it to a gtx 2050 if I remember correctly
[15:13:12] <Renderwww> 1050
[15:13:42] <Renderwww> or a ps4
[15:13:46] <markuskj> what's the irssi command for taking extreme distance from a hardware geek channel
[15:13:58] <Faux> /buffer notify highlight 
[15:14:21] <Renderwww> did the nejicomi game also count as hardware?
[15:15:37] <jotham> yeah was wondering about just buying a ps5
[15:15:44] <jotham> instead of building a new pc (which is what i really want)
[15:16:03] <Renderwww> isn't ps5 supply also very limited?
[15:16:42] <Renderwww> just keep your computer and keep playing indie crap
[15:17:10] <jotham> well my favorite indie crap is all single core limited now days
[15:17:12] <jotham> thanks to unity
[15:17:20] <markuskj> everything will slow down to a halt, the end is near
[15:17:22] <jotham> so i really need a new cpu, which means new ram, new mobo etc
[15:17:50] <jotham> large bases in oxygen not included and rimworld cause my computer serious headaches
[15:18:04] <jotham> and the city in horse puncher lags out my entire pc and it's not the gpu that is crying
[15:18:24] <jotham> having an ultrawide does cause a lot of gpu issues though, so i'd like a new gpu
[15:18:31] <jotham> 3440x1440 or whatever it is
[15:18:58] * jotham screams in personal computer
[15:19:02] <Faux> That's like two monitors in one.
[15:19:10] <jotham> yeah it's fucking great for work
[15:19:29] <jotham> everything split 50/50 it's like the old days of 2x 1024x768 but with no weird bezel crap
[15:19:30] *** Quits: Carbonflux (~Carbonflu@c-66-235-54-179.sea.wa.customer.broadstripe.net) (Quit: When all you have are solutions, everything is a problem.)
[15:19:48] <Faux> I'd probably have to learn how to use i3 if I had that.
[15:19:54] <Faux> I have that resolution but with bezels.
[15:22:30] <jotham> yeah i3 on it is great
[15:22:35] <jotham> i3 sucks with more than one real monitor
[15:22:39] <jotham> in my experience
[15:22:42] <jotham> maybe i'm just a rookie
[15:22:57] <Faux> I use just meta+o teleport to the other monitor.
[15:23:07] <Faux> And otherwise generally ignore the fact that there are two monitors; and deal only in workspaces.
[15:23:12] <jotham> yeah okay
[15:23:15] <Faux> Don't have any long-lived splits.
[15:23:26] <jotham> i haven't used i3 with more than one monitor much
[15:23:33] <Faux> If you wanna read docs while using intellij, meta+shift+1 teleport chrome to intellij, it'll be split, done.
[15:23:56] <Faux> If you have run out of workspaces, meta+t tabs away the other window that's appeared in my terminal split.
[15:24:55] <jotham> i usually just go tab mad in i3
[15:24:59] <jotham> then fullscreen them sometimes
[15:25:10] <jotham> wonder if that's a side effect of web browsing
[15:25:21] <jotham> and having dedicated work spaces for each train of thought
[15:25:24] <jotham> which also gets messy af
[15:25:43] <Faux> Train of thought? Sounds like a liberal conspiracy.
[15:25:51] <jotham> oh fuck here is a workspace with 300 chromes and 4 vims and some fucking massive json file
[15:26:20] <jotham> reminds me i have a nodejs job monday
[15:26:27] <Faux> ohno
[15:26:29] <Faux> Same.
[15:26:33] <Renderwww> ultra wide monitors are a meme, would not recommend
[15:26:37] <jotham> migrating it from 10 or something to whatever current LTS is
[15:26:43] <jotham> wonder how much code will break
[15:26:47] <jotham> and packages will stop existing
[15:26:50] * Renderwww cries in    5120x1440    119.97*+ 100.00    59.98
[15:27:06] <Faux> All the database drivers broke on that upgrade for us.
[15:27:08] <Faux> JUST SAYING.
[15:27:15] <jotham> :<
[15:27:25] <Faux> All fixed upstream but obviously nobody applies updates.
[15:27:36] <jotham> could just keep using ancient node until the world ends
[15:27:39] <jotham> which might be quite soon
[15:28:04] <Faux> Wow, even 12 is nearly out of support.
[15:28:09] <jotham> good guy putin removes our worry about old code
[15:28:11] <Faux> Not sure we'll be off 14 by Apr 2023.
[15:28:34] <Renderwww> updating implies the software wasn't perfect on release, which can't be true
[15:30:06] <jotham> i think i can confidently say
[15:30:23] <jotham> CarbonFlux is the only member of our clique to have ever written a perfect program
