[00:00:11] <chazy> what happens when i do arithmetic operations and strict types is on? if i add a float to a string?
[00:00:23] <TinoDidriksen> If you want to preserve decimals integrity then manipulate them with BC or GMP.
[00:00:27] <__adrian> it will convert the string to a number (int or float)
[00:00:31] <__adrian> use a math lib.
[00:00:38] <chazy> BC?
[00:00:44] <TinoDidriksen> Double/float is fine to use normal arithmetics on.

[00:04:01] <chazy> is BC not precise?
[00:04:08] <chazy> which should i use?
[00:04:09] <TinoDidriksen> BC is precise.
[00:04:26] <TinoDidriksen> BC is an arbitrary precision library. There's several.
[00:04:49] <chazy> wait, i was reading arbitrary as bad
[00:05:21] <TinoDidriksen> Ah. In this case it means "almost infinite".
[00:05:23] <__adrian> "arbitrary precision" means "you can put the decimal point whereever you like"
[00:05:52] <__adrian> arbitrary ≠ random ≠ unknown
[00:07:08] <TinoDidriksen> Unfortunately, English is not math. https://thesaurus.com/browse/arbitrary is not the specific term used here.
[00:07:40] <TinoDidriksen> I would love to see an irresponsible precision library.

[00:08:15] <chazy> ok, so if i don't do anything pdo will fetch decimals as strings?
[00:08:22] <__adrian> yes
[00:08:44] <chazy> i'll use BC functions then
[00:09:14] <__adrian> also remember, while pdo converting types is NICE, and you should use REAL prepares anyway, it does require awareness and control of your particular code environment.
[00:09:58] <__adrian> e.g., if you end up using a pdo instance  without specifying real prepares, you can end up with a broken application
[00:10:46] <TinoDidriksen> Or simply one not built against mysqlnd.

[00:11:42] <__adrian> that's a less likely problem
[00:12:24] <__adrian> but (e.g.) real prepares not being the default means this is a more problematic choice for say, libraries
[00:13:19] <chazy> i'm reading about bcadd() and i have to specify the # of decimals, and i don't think i always know, but i can't hardcode the maximum number of decimals to be the same as the column type, would that be a solution?

[02:54:55] <Blondie101010> preferably some DDoS protection, but that's expensive
[02:55:08] <Albright> I doubt it's targeted. Most likely someone shotgunning exploits and seeing if some server responds in some way to indicate a vulnerability.
[02:55:17] <Albright> That's usually how these work.
[02:55:24] <Blondie101010> he suffered a big DDoS, so targetted
[02:55:27] <da_wunder> yep
[02:55:35] <Blondie101010> but it depends what he calls "big" though

[02:58:01] <Thanatermesis> Blondie101010, yes, ddos protection is expensive, i try to make my own protection using good firewall rules, plugins, and fail2ban matches

[02:59:28] <Blondie101010> how big was the attack?
[02:59:41] <ramblebamble> depending on your setup, you may want to consider using openresty, in scenarios like this, you could enable its WAF capabilitys mimik your source-codes response and just pretty much route it to null so to speak without a lot of changes being detected as the webserver and not fail2ban respons
[03:00:32] <ramblebamble> but a later date after the urgent part
[03:00:47] <Thanatermesis> the only strange thing in the DDOS attack of yesterday is that the server (nginx+php) continued to start even if i stopped the service (with nginx running, the external requests by multiple IPs made the server entirely bottlenecked), so i needed to run a "while true... stop server.. continue" in order to avoid that, i dont knmow why the nginx kept restarting (maybe systemd? hum)

[03:02:22] <ramblebamble> Thanatermesis, probably someone renting boxes in clouds

[03:06:40] <Blondie101010> one way can be to combine some, for example
[03:07:02] <ramblebamble> Those cloud-providers usually have a help-desk, some information where you can report abuse e.g. for alibaba Registrar Abuse Contact Email: DomainAbuse@service.aliyun.com from whois alibaba.com, write them or their tech-support and notify them of your circumstances
[03:07:11] <Thanatermesis> Blondie101010, well if hte vulneravility is in the OS that is solved for when i finally move it to the new one (everything clean & reinstalled), but if is inside the wordpress install, that can be difficult to find, i don't even know how to detect that there's something that shoudl not be there
[03:08:01] <Blondie101010> frankly it's impossible to be sure, but a cautious overview of files and the site should give you a pretty decent idea if it's compromised or not
[03:08:45] <Blondie101010> it's usually visible in the page source, or often obvious at the end of some scripts
[03:09:57] <Thanatermesis> hum, maybe installing a dummy wordpress and the same plugins, and then using "meld" to compare file contents, also check uploads and all, this should suffice for the files I assume
[03:10:03] <Blondie101010> though intruders could change file timestamps, they rarely or never do
[03:10:12] <ramblebamble> And only if they are not very sneaky, e.g. gaining local foothold will enable them to utilize mysql, allowing them to potentially download, manipulate additional files
[03:10:26] <Thanatermesis> what about the database? is there any thing possible to have been inserted in the database? how i should check that?
[03:10:43] <Blondie101010> if the server is set up properly, they shouldn't be able to go beyond the site itself
[03:11:06] <ramblebamble> Thanatermesis, I would be very careful with installing a dummy wordpress and just leaving it up, honeypots are not to be taken lightly

[03:11:57] <Thanatermesis> Blondie101010, hum, sounds like i can make a script to check the timestamps of the files and compare them in the future... i dont know if there's tools / scripts that already does these things
[03:12:10] <Blondie101010> just `find`
[03:12:33] <Blondie101010> find . -mtime -20 # to list files modified in the past 20 days
[03:12:47] <Thanatermesis> ha! much simpler
[03:14:23] <BadAdviceCat> Thanatermesis, it's virtually impossible to stop DDoS. The only thing one can do is just have a big enough pipe/bandwidth to be able to handle the connections. That's where the expensive part comes from, and there are hosting services that can not justify paying a fat internet bill just so that your website can stay online. It's easier to just blackhole/null route your website and call it a day.
[03:14:49] <BadAdviceCat> Ironically, nullrouting is technically helping the attacker, because that takes your website down.

[03:16:42] <BadAdviceCat> The expensive part is hiring people to go about trying to figure out which traffic is good, and which traffic is bad. With attacks becoming much more elegant and easier to spoof, it's harder to tell if a traffic is good or bad. <-- If an ISP sees this, they can assume  that maybe perhaps your website is "Just popular" and give you a fat internet bill for it.
[03:18:29] <ramblebamble> Oh and Thanatermesis, also consider purging/rotating your fail2ban logs, with the ipv6 address space I can very easily use up the disk storage by spoofing addresses and trying to log in with bogus data, not interest in gaining access but using up all your diskspace in the process.
[03:26:27] <Blondie101010> either way, this was a small attack, probably just scanning for easy to find vulnerabilities, but those can sometimes precede bigger attacks if they consider your machine of interest

[04:27:37] <chozorho> This post on SO matches my problem perfectly: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37261957/mongodb-fatal-error-class-mongoclient-not-found
[04:27:40] <chozorho> but there is a catch...
[04:28:05] <chozorho> when I try applying their advice and using " new MongoDB\Driver\Manager" ...
[04:28:28] <chozorho> it gives "PHP Fatal error: Uncaught Error: Class 'MongoDB\\Driver\\Manager' not found in /var/www/html/*****.php:31\nStack trace:\n#0 {main}\n thrown in /var/www/html/*****.php on line 31"
[04:29:10] <chozorho> this is really weird, because I know for a fact that I installed php7.4-mongodb, and I see the extension "mongo.so" in my list of install d extensions
[04:30:44] <da_wunder> maybe you've multiple php.ini files for each php versions that you're using - so check what you're using by creating eg. simple info.php with <?php phpinfo(); and just open that file on your browser
[04:32:21] <chozorho> holyyyyy
[04:33:12] <chozorho> that's insane... all this time I was modifying php7.4 (that's the version when I type `php --version` on the host), but phpinfo() displays 7.3 ...
[04:33:31] <da_wunder> because cli !== webserver
[04:34:04] <chozorho> danng, ok.. thanks so much!
[04:34:22] <da_wunder> np
[04:34:34] <chozorho> uhh but wait... will modifying the 7.3 configuration file be enough...? I guess I'll find out
[04:34:53] <da_wunder> you should check your webserver configuration
[04:37:26] <Nekomander> Thanatermesis, if you scroll down to "Whence Shall I Source My Solutions?", this is pretty much the most you can do on your end anyway: http://cryto.net/~joepie91/blog/2016/07/14/cloudflare-we-have-a-problem/
[04:40:17] <da_wunder> and this is just one reason - why I like to use docker for development - easy to use different php versions and etc. and those are totally separated
[04:53:59] <chozorho> wait... the uhh
[04:54:58] <chozorho> oh. I've been adding files (or at least symbolic links) to the /etc/php/7.3/cli/conf.d/ directory...
[04:55:20] <chozorho> but there is another directory alongside it, called /etc/php/7.3/apache2/conf.d ...
[04:55:31] <chozorho> I probably should've been updating the latter
[04:55:50] <da_wunder> 03:03 < da_wunder> because cli !== webserver
[04:56:56] <chozorho> ok ok lol. I am slowly figuring this out

[06:01:46] <Thanatermesis> is there any tools (scripts) that I can run to check my Wordpress install to scan possible malicious files / code / database ?
[06:02:03] <__adrian> recommend asking on #wordpress

[06:13:52] <Thanatermesis> hum, i dont think they will know much about anything our of the frontend
[06:14:12] <Thanatermesis> well, i was asking for a generic tool to scan php files or similar
[06:14:27] <Thanatermesis> i needed to write my own in the past which do a few tests but maybe there's a better one that i should use instead
[06:14:37] *** Quits: chozorho (~chozorho@2601:146:300:c30::6b8f) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[06:24:13] <Blondie101010> Thanatermesis:  did you customize any WP code?
[06:27:22] <__adrian> as for whether there's a "generic tool" - nothing i'd consider useful. code review is more useful. look at owasp, learn about what good practices are. if you have a specific question or concern you're welcome to ask; if it's wp-specific (i.e., can't be answered if i don't know anything about wordpress) then #wordpress is the better place to ask.
[06:30:14] <Thanatermesis> Blondie101010, except for an own plugin, the original WP code is the same
[06:30:54] <Blondie101010> does "own plugin" mean a plugin you wrote?
[06:31:27] <Thanatermesis> __adrian, code review?  find . -iname '*'php -exec cat {} \; | wc -l  >>>>> 1,2 million lines :)
[06:31:42] <__adrian> your plugin is 2mm lines?
[06:31:48] <Thanatermesis> Blondie101010, yes, only that, the rest is original WP code and the themes/plugins installed on it
[06:32:07] <__adrian> you don't need to review wordpress. you reivew your own code, ideally as you commit it.
[06:32:23] <Thanatermesis> __adrian, not my plugins, the full dir of WP with everything, so if a file has been compromised / uploaded / modified it can be in any place I assume
[06:32:36] <Blondie101010> Thanatermesis:  then you just export your data, move this installation to the side, reinstall everything, and import the data
[06:33:06] <__adrian> (1) don't change WP (2) just check if anything's changed. you could even use git for this.
[06:33:33] <__adrian> and again, ask on #wordpress. i'd wager there is such a tool.
[06:33:33] <Blondie101010> yeah that can provide FIM
[06:33:41] <Thanatermesis> Blondie101010, yeah i was thinking on that, making a new WP install with same plugins/themes (installed new) and then use 'meld' to compare the files to see if tehre's anything strange, finally import the original (hopefully not hacked) DB
[06:34:02] <__adrian> make regular backups
[06:34:15] <__adrian> that way if you DB is compromised you minimize losses
[06:34:30] <Thanatermesis> __adrian, ah, not bad idea, just git init on the dir and run check commands every hour or so, mmh
[06:34:48] <Thanatermesis> mmh is there a way to know / scan the db to see if theres anything compromised?
[06:34:56] <__adrian> no
[06:35:05] <__adrian> you can't know what that would look like.
[06:35:15] <Blondie101010> Thanatermesis:  you sound like you're putting your focus at the wrong place
[06:35:21] <__adrian> ^
[06:35:36] <__adrian> > every hour or so  // do you think that you're at particular risk for some reason?
[06:35:51] <Blondie101010> if the server is properly secured, the hacker will NOT be able to change the source code
[06:36:28] <__adrian> which is not to say i'd expect wordpress to be a fortress, but still
[06:36:30] <Blondie101010> that's a matter of file and process permissions
[06:36:47] <__adrian> you need wp-focused tools for this. i know such things exist.
[06:36:57] <Thanatermesis> __adrian, i have been DDOS attacked recently and there was a strange thing on it (i was unable to stop the nginx process), now im moving the server but i dont want to import compromised contents
[06:37:20] <__adrian> you're moving servers because of a ddos attack?  .__·
[06:37:21] <Blondie101010> yeah, I suppose it probably writes all over the place
[06:37:50] <Thanatermesis> __adrian, no, i was already moving to a new server but it just happened the day before so.. good thing :)
[06:38:42] <__adrian> you realize a ddos doesn't "compromise" anything? it's basically like too many people trying to walk through your door at the same time
[06:38:47] <Blondie101010> Thanatermesis:  should there be malicious code in the DB, it would *most* likely affect the clients

[06:39:13] <__adrian> no one's got their hands in the cash register
[06:39:16] <Thanatermesis> __adrian, yes, but the strange thing is that was unable to stop the nginx process (it re-started everytime), thats why i wonder if there have been something compromised that caused that
[06:39:33] <__adrian> ...maybe
[06:39:42] <__adrian> i'd guess it's more likely just misconfigured
[06:39:48] <Blondie101010> Thanatermesis:  what command did you type and what was the output?
[06:40:05] <__adrian> are you self-hosted? are you the sysadmin?
[06:40:34] <Thanatermesis> systemctl stop mariadb.service php7.3-fpm.service nginx.service monit.service   (see the monit, which is the only process i know it should restart nginx, i dont think systemd does that on its own)
[06:40:44] <Thanatermesis> __adrian, yep x2
[06:41:04] <__adrian> are you also the programmer or is that someone else
[06:42:49] <Thanatermesis> yeah i need to manage everything lol
[06:43:43] <__adrian> which would you consider your primary/preferred role
[06:44:22] <Thanatermesis> it was very strange that the webserver didn't stopped, my only solution was to run a "while true" to continuously stop it each second, in order to stop the ddos (which was accessing to thousands of http files)
[06:45:01] <Blondie101010> the only way this would be related to an attack is if your server is completely under their control
[06:45:04] <Thanatermesis> __adrian, in fact is not even my role but since i dont have the resources to pay someone to manage these things, i need to setup servers, website, and everything that these includes...
[06:45:21] <Blondie101010> I don't think it's the case
[06:46:28] <Blondie101010> it sounds like you probably have service dependency issues involved
[06:46:54] <__adrian> k. so sincerely, you really do need to be talking to wordpress-focused people when it comes to the application itself. there's not a generic solution. blondie sometimes enjoys fielding sysadminish questions, though.
[06:47:46] <Thanatermesis> well, its strange, when i normally stop nginx its just stopped without restarting (even verified that today), so still something that i dont quite unerstood why it happened this way
[06:51:14] <Blondie101010> I'd look at the nginx logs, which should reflect the times it got restarted

[13:42:35] <velix> I wonder, if "match" is really that good. Actually, isn't the substituation array reloaded when it's inside a loop? Or is the compiler smart enough to compile this only once? I've learned: put static arrays outside a loop.
[13:43:36] <velix> a better solution might be match ($food, $cases) ... where $cases is outside the loop.
[13:44:35] <velix> but sure, $cases can't be `$a, $b, $c => 5` then, since [] doesn't support this :(

[14:05:50] <Splash> AllenJB i've found this:
[14:05:52] <Splash> How to convert ISO8601 to Date format in php
[14:05:59] <Splash> $ultimo_login = date('Y-m-d H:i:s', strtotime($last_loged_on_ts));
[14:06:11] <Splash> so this could be the solution?
[14:07:17] <AllenJB> strtotime() may work, but it has some caveats. It's essentially a set of rules to attempt to parse "any common date/time format". But it can interpret them incorrectly. If the format of the date string you're parsing changes, you may not know and strtotime() may interpret it incorrectly.
[14:08:05] <AllenJB> Using DateTime::createFromFormat() is more precise - if the date format changes it will (almost always) fail, so you will know about it. And you know exactly how it's parsing the date/time string.

[20:22:56] <Thanatermesis> Blondie101010, yes, i still continue working on that, this was a tab i still had opened and wanted to know if anybody tried it

[20:27:44] <Blondie101010> the only proper approach to answer your own question is to look at the reviews/issues, stars, change logs, possibly check the code for malicious intents, and then to try it if you determined it looks safe
[20:28:23] <Blondie101010> but we already told you that such tools are not very good in general, and won't give you any definite answer even if they were
[20:28:46] <Blondie101010> that is unneeded since you do not move the code to the new server
[20:28:54] <Blondie101010> *that* was the solution
[20:29:30] <Blondie101010> and to consult wordpress support for relevant security and backup options
[20:30:44] <Blondie101010> you should normally already be done, as it's basically, install backup plugin, export data, install new server, install backup plugin, import data, done
[20:31:15] <Blondie101010> of course you may need a bit more time to readjust and customize the new machine, but that's still how you approach it
[20:31:51] <Blondie101010> right now you're looking for something that likely won't ever help you even if you work full time on it for a decade
