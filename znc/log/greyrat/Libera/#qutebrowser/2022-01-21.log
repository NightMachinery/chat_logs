[01:13:07] <The-Compiler> elshize, Dieterbe, topcat001: https://github.com/akissinger/dodo looks interesting too as for mailclients
[01:14:45] <elshize> The-Compiler: haven't seen this before; looks alot (see what I did there...) like astroid, but qt; I suppose would be easier to contribute for you if you want to scratch an itch ;)
[01:15:51] <elshize> I have to be honest though, I'm perfectly fine with opening html emails in the browser; most of the html emails I need rendered are junk anyway
[01:16:17] <The-Compiler> I'm mainly looking for a good tagging system
[01:16:38] <elshize> in that case, do try alot; I personally think it's great
[01:17:03] <elshize> quite extensible too, can write hook functions in python, which is very convenient
[01:18:04] <The-Compiler> noted, I think that would work for me as well
[01:19:01] <elshize> the beauty of notmuch is that you can try different clients interchangeably really
[01:19:51] <elshize> the actuall backend doing tagging and filtering/searching is the same

[18:14:44] <Nickli> yt ?
[18:26:04] *** Joins: arkurious (~arkurious@user/arkurious)
[18:26:15] <emanuele6> VincentVega: i don't think you can make qutebrowser yank a newline with an inline copy
[18:27:15] <emanuele6> but if title + " " + url is fine,  :yank inline {title}" "{url}
[18:28:20] <emanuele6> or you could use xclip(1) with some sh as glue to yank the newline
[18:29:39] <emanuele6> e.g.   :spawn sh -c 'printf %s\\n%s "$1" "$2" | xclip -i -selection clipboard' _ {title} {url}
[18:31:16] <emanuele6> (maybe there is a way to represent a newline in a qutebrowser string and i just don't know it)
[18:32:07] <VincentVega> emanuele6: Oh, nice, thank you! Yes, I will mess around with this a little further.
[18:36:37] <emanuele6> VincentVega: oh, actually, you totally can put a newline in a qutebrowser string
[18:36:44] <emanuele6> but it has to be literal
[18:36:55] <emanuele6> so use :edit-command to type it in
[18:37:24] <emanuele6> 1| :yank inline {title}"
[18:37:30] <emanuele6> 2| "{url}
[18:37:37] <emanuele6> something like that will work
[18:38:19] <The-Compiler> ninewise: another item for your parser notes perhaps
[18:38:43] <VincentVega> emanuele6: awesome, I will try that!
[18:39:11] <emanuele6> ( if you are binding this key from python, you can probably just use  config.bind('whatever', 'yank {title}"\n"{url}', mode=whatever) )
[18:40:35] <emanuele6> but having something like {nl} would be nice :)
[18:44:21] <Earnestly> borg has {NL} for its list format
[18:44:30] <VincentVega> emanuele6: hmm, maybe I am not escaping something right, but this: 
[18:44:32] <VincentVega> config.bind('yY', "yank inline {title}\"\n\"{url}")
[18:44:44] <VincentVega> produces an error ""{url}' - may not contain unprintable chars!"
[18:44:58] <The-Compiler> VincentVega: why the additional quotes?
[18:45:08] <The-Compiler> though not sure if it would work without them, hm
[18:45:42] <emanuele6> The-Compiler: it doesn't
[18:46:48] <VincentVega> The-Compiler: "yank inline {title}+" + '\n' + "{url}" produces: {url}' - may not contain unprintable chars!
[18:46:48] <VincentVega>  
[18:47:23] <The-Compiler> VincentVega: you could just do  "yank inline {title}\n{url}"  from Python's perspective
[18:47:34] <The-Compiler> but apparently from qutebrowser's that won't work either
[18:48:08] <emanuele6> actually, i had not tried  config.bind('yY', 'yank inline {title}"\n"{url}')
[18:48:14] <emanuele6> that crashes qutebrowser for me
[18:48:53] <emanuele6> well, you can probably use `:edit-command' and `:bind' to make that binding
[18:49:53] <emanuele6> interesting
[18:50:01] <emanuele6> 1| :yank inline {title}"
[18:50:03] <emanuele6> 2| "{url}
[18:50:05] <emanuele6> this works
[18:50:20] <emanuele6> 1| :bind yY yank inline {title}"
[18:50:22] <emanuele6> 2| "{url}
[18:50:41] <emanuele6> this prints the error VincentVega sent before
[18:54:25] <emanuele6>  [[ $'\n' == [^[:print:]] ]] && echo not printable
[18:54:54] <emanuele6> technically newline is not a [:print:] (printable) character
[18:55:34] <emanuele6> probably :bind is disallowing those, even though :yank is fine with them
[18:58:12] <VincentVega> emanuele6: Eh, guess I will just roll with a space then. It's only a mild annoyance, I can do the line wrap manually for now.. But I will surely hang around to see if someone maybe offers a solution!
[18:58:41] <emanuele6> you could just use :bind yY spawn sh -c 'printf %s\\n%s "$1" "$2" | xclip -i -selection clipboard' _ {title} {url}
[18:58:55] <emanuele6> that doesn't have any literal newline
[18:59:55] <VincentVega> or, right! Sorry, I missed that somehow.
[19:05:15] <VincentVega> emanuele6: yeah, this did it nicely, in case someone else is interested: config.bind('yY', "spawn sh -c 'printf %s\\\\n%s \"$1\" \"$2\" | xclip -i -selection clipboard' _ {title} {url}")
