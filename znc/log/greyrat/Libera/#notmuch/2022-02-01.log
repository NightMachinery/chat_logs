[14:01:31] <cosimone> hello, i have a question about the emacs frontend: when pressing r to reply to a message, invoking notmuch-show-reply-sender, the "from" address is automatically deduced from the message i'm replying to.  while the address itself is correct, the real name used is the one configured in .notmuch-config, if any.  since i have multiple identities, this is not very convenient.  i have them set in the emacs variable notmuch-identities, but i
[14:01:34] <cosimone> doesn't seem to work for replies.  it works fine for sending non-reply messages, however, and they also show up correctly if i use an universal argument before pressing r for the reply (which invokes a prompt for the sender).  any idea on how to solve this?  i'd like notmuch-show-reply-sender to also fill in the same real name that was used in the "to" header of the original message, if it's possible at all

[19:59:13] <dkg> i mean, i noticed notmuch making this mistake 7 years ago, and it was fixed by amdragon and bremner within a week.  no fussing about it, no handwringing, no delays.
[19:59:42] <bremner> micah: too late now I guess, but can you give the stack trace again with notmuch-dbgsym installed?
[19:59:45] <bremner> yeah, I miss amdragon :P

[20:00:29] <bremner> he got a job at Google, so it depends on your definition of OK

[20:02:26] <dkg> (not that i'm as responsive or persistent as i'd like to be even without getting a job at Google either -- sorry to have been idle in notmuch for a while)
[20:05:53] <bremner> welcome back, for however long you're around
[20:06:18] <bremner> you and cworth can reminisce about the good old days :).
[20:07:26] <micah> bremner: unfortunately... notmuch-dbgsym is not in backports, and I've got the notmuch from backports
[20:07:51] <bremner> ah. I don't know how debug symbols are supposed to work in backports.
[20:09:56] <bremner> I asked in #debian-backports, will report if I get a useful answer
[20:16:06] <bremner> micah: try adding  "deb http://deb.debian.org/debian-debug bullseye-backports-debug"
[20:23:13] <dkg> micah: you're running stable nowâ€½  i think you were the first person who i knew who was comfortable running unstable
[20:23:34] <dkg> bremner: thanks :)

[20:36:14] <bremner> hrm. maybe when NZ wakes up olly can comment, but it looks like a corrupted db / xapian issue.  Is that with the rebuild database?
[20:40:03] <bremner> micah: you could also try running notmuch new under valgrind, although there is a severe slowdown. But this is C code, so memory errors are a distinct possibility
[20:48:24] <fnstudio> hi, i can have my emacs-notmuch call "notmuch new" when i press "G"; however, if i'm not mistaken, that doesn't trigger a mbsync syncronisation
[20:49:04] <fnstudio> is there an established way of handling that?
[20:49:16] <fnstudio> of course, i have my mbsync script in a cron script
[20:49:17] <bremner> use a hook for notmuch-new?
[20:50:17] <fnstudio> bremner: thanks, so something that happens before notmuch-new is called?
[20:50:34] <fnstudio> ok looking into it now, thanks!
[20:52:30] <fnstudio> sorry, you meant as in "emacs hooks", right? or something along the lines of https://notmuchmail.org/manpages/notmuch-hooks-5/ ?
[20:52:40] <bremner> the latter
[20:53:44] <fnstudio> yeah i see, interesting, thanks
[21:05:47] <fnstudio> works like a charm, thanks
[21:06:51] <fnstudio> although i'm thinking to just have a shell script to run manually (or via emacs) instead of having a pre-hook that's run on every notmuch-run
[21:07:32] <fnstudio> i understand there's a --no-hook option for that case
[21:08:23] <fnstudio> but thinking of the number of times i want a poll+new vs a notmuch-new, i might be fine with a shell script run manually

[23:54:27] <cworth> cosimone: You're basically running into two different systems. For the reply, this is using `notmuch reply`, a notmuch CLI thing that is not aware of any emacs configuration, (but is aware of your user.name notmuch configuration). The notmuch-identities stuff is emacs-specific.
[23:55:14] <cworth> So I'm guessing there's some missing code (on the emacs side) to massage what "notmuch reply" provides in the way that your notmuch-identities configuration wants.
[23:56:57] <cworth> dkg: Hey there! I'm only recently back in notmuch IRC myself. Not that I've touched any code yet, but I'm at least answering the odd question here or there.
[23:57:32] <cworth> And, after being laid off from my job mid December, I accepted a new job yesterday while successfully _not_ getting hired by Google. So that's good. ;-)
