[00:17:16] <elisescu> Hi! I am trying to model a simple relation between a team, its leader and the rest of members, by doing something along the lines: https://dpaste.org/NUZz. However, I get this error: "app.Team.team_lead: (fields.E303) Reverse query name for 'app.Team.team_lead' clashes with field name 'app.Member.team'.

I read this page here: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/ref/models/fields/#django.db.models.ForeignKey.related_name,

[00:32:15] <FunkyBob> so if you create a fkey from User to Team, then Team gets a user_set for its related Users?

[01:18:08] <elisescu> FunkyBob relating to my question above, and you mentioning "so if you create a fkey from User to Team, then Team gets a user_set for its related Users?" - I get that on a superficial level, but I don't understand more deeply, and where the collision happens. Do you know where I can read more than what I found here:
[01:18:08] <elisescu> https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/topics/db/queries/#backwards-related-objects?
[01:18:30] <FunkyBob> yes
[01:18:49] <FunkyBob> elisescu: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/topics/db/queries/#following-relationships-backward
[01:19:14] <FunkyBob> the collission happens when the default auto-generated names match... so you must explcitly specify the name to use
[01:29:32] <elisescu> Thanks for the link. Reading through that, I'm still a bit confused, mainly by reading "By default, this Manager is named FOO_set, where FOO is the source model name, lowercased" . Given that it has the `_set` suffix, the collision can't be with this manager instance, so what is that "reverse query name" (from Reverse query name for
[01:29:33] <elisescu> 'app.Team.team_lead' clashes with )?
[01:30:14] <elisescu> Anyway, I know how to solve the problem, but would be nice to understand the actual root cause. And thx for your help

[03:45:57] <wallbroken> FunkyBob: can i ask you for help on a particular scenario?
[03:46:27] <FunkyBob> don't ask to ask
[03:46:28] <wallbroken> do you remember that in my project there is a Distribution Center which feeds a set of stores?
[03:46:37] <FunkyBob> yes... the Warehouse
[03:46:54] <wallbroken> now, let's consider my project as a cluster of instances
[03:47:11] <wallbroken> one in the region A, another one in the region B, and so on..
[03:47:39] <FunkyBob> sounds like something that could easily be managed in a single instance, but ok
[03:47:44] <wallbroken> a store associated to the DC of region A can get items from the one associated to the region B
[03:47:52] <wallbroken> passing trough region A DC
[03:47:58] <wallbroken> using a shipment route
[03:48:15] <wallbroken> so the complication is to sync all the availability between DC's
[03:48:37] <wallbroken> so, DC A must know all the transations of other clusters
[03:48:49] <wallbroken> it's like a single distribuited DC
[03:48:51] <FunkyBob> remember the many dozens of times I told you to write a proper spec?
[03:49:03] <FunkyBob> now are you seeing why?
[03:49:16] <wallbroken> yes, but now there is a new requirement
[03:49:31] <FunkyBob> why should store A have to know about any other DC? can't the DC resolve the order on their behalf?
[03:49:54] <FunkyBob> I know, I know, not your business... just your problem.
[03:50:03] <wallbroken> wait
[03:50:23] <wallbroken> the communication keeps between store of cluster A and DC of cluster A
[03:50:41] <wallbroken> but DC of cluster A must keep track of the availability of items in other DC's
[03:50:42] <FunkyBob> and by "cluster A" you mean "DC A and all its stores"?
[03:50:47] <wallbroken> yes
[03:50:55] <FunkyBob> keep track? or consult when needed?
[03:51:07] <FunkyBob> it would be dangerously tricky if it had to keep track
[03:51:43] <wallbroken> it's clear the purpose? store A can make orders also to other DC's
[03:52:05] <wallbroken> so, other DC's must send all the changes of items to the DC A
[03:52:09] <FunkyBob> Goal: store A should be able to order products, even if they're not in stock in their associated DC ?
[03:52:11] <wallbroken> it's called "replication"
[03:52:18] <wallbroken> exactly
[03:52:35] <wallbroken> but store A communicates only with its associated DC
[03:52:37] <FunkyBob> so how long is it OK for DC A to be wrong about stock in other DCs?
[03:52:38] <wallbroken> not with the others
[03:53:00] <wallbroken> it cannot be wrong
[03:53:04] <FunkyBob> then you're fucked
[03:53:16] <FunkyBob> or this system will be _torturously_ slow
[03:53:24] <wallbroken> somebody told me "use a distribuited database system"
[03:53:26] <FunkyBob> and will require EVERYTHING to shut down if any DC loses connection
[03:53:27] <FunkyBob> yes
[03:53:34] <FunkyBob> now look up the CAP theorem
[03:54:01] <FunkyBob> Consistency, Availability, Performance... pick any 2
[03:54:12] <wallbroken> if a DC goes offline, when it come backs online it should tell the other DC's, "ehy, this is the last transaction i got, give me the new ones"
[03:54:24] *** Quits: dez (uid92154@user/dez) (Quit: Connection closed for inactivity)
[03:54:34] <FunkyBob> you assume all DCs will detect it's offline immediately
[03:54:57] <wallbroken> are you saying that there is not an easy solution to this problem?
[03:55:09] <FunkyBob> I have said that, and yes, I will say it again and again until you believe
[03:55:20] <FunkyBob> if you want it distributed, you're in for a world of hurt
[03:55:26] <FunkyBob> my question is-- why must it be distributed?
[03:55:31] <FunkyBob> why can't it all be one system?
[03:55:46] <wallbroken> because each DC have their own feeders
[03:55:58] <wallbroken> i'm not sure i can call them "feeders"
[03:55:58] <FunkyBob> whatever a "feeder" is
[03:56:13] <wallbroken> in italy is "fornitore"
[03:56:13] <FunkyBob> you can call it whatever you like, so long as you explain WHAT IT IS
[03:56:16] <wallbroken> let me translate it
[03:56:34] <FunkyBob> supplier
[03:56:38] <wallbroken> exactly
[03:56:44] <FunkyBob> google translate FTW
[03:56:48] <FunkyBob> so... how is that relevant?
[03:57:31] <wallbroken> supplier of DC A could not be the supplier of DC B
[03:57:40] <FunkyBob> ok, and?
[03:57:52] <wallbroken> but a store of cluster B could need an item from the supplier of DC A
[03:58:05] <FunkyBob> ok, and?
[03:58:29] <FunkyBob> i feel like there's something to this design you haven't explained that might make this separation make sense
[03:58:32] <FunkyBob> but so far, I don't see it
[03:58:47] *** Joins: bambanxx (~bambanx@181-163-36-95.baf.movistar.cl)
[03:59:22] <wallbroken> so, store B sends the order to DC B, DC B forwards it (if available) to DC A. then DC A sends the item using an internal DC route to DC B. and DC B gives the item to the store B
[03:59:30] <wallbroken> now it's quite clear?
[03:59:32] <FunkyBob> sure
[03:59:41] <FunkyBob> but none of that explains why this needs to be a distributed system
[03:59:56] <wallbroken> because DC's are dislocated around the country
[04:00:18] <wallbroken> and each DB is managed indipendently
[04:00:36] <FunkyBob> physical location is irrelevant... perhaps you've heard of the internet?
[04:00:41] <FunkyBob> again... why?
[04:01:01] <FunkyBob> if you're building this system to track orders... why must it be distributed?
[04:01:38] <wallbroken> because each DC uses its own already existing database
[04:02:11] <FunkyBob> ok, then I'm confused about what you're building... how it fits in with the rest of what's here
[04:03:01] <wallbroken> FunkyBob: each DC has its own database, i should integrate it in django backend application
[04:03:07] <wallbroken> for each DC
[04:03:10] <FunkyBob> ...
[04:03:19] <FunkyBob> integrate in what way? for what purpose?
[04:03:19] <wallbroken> not possible to do that?
[04:03:47] <FunkyBob> might be possible, if you were more specific about what "integrate" means in this context
[04:03:56] <wallbroken> integrate in the way of some integration connectors with django application
[04:04:12] <wallbroken> each DC uses SAP
[04:04:13] <FunkyBob> ...
[04:04:18] <FunkyBob> still meaningless
[04:04:25] <wallbroken> and has their connector using rabbitMQ messages
[04:04:37] <wallbroken> so i can feed the django database from those messages
[04:04:44] <FunkyBob> what's _in_ those messages?
[04:04:51] <FunkyBob> what purpose do they serve?
[04:04:53] <wallbroken> JSON
[04:05:02] <FunkyBob> not what format are they
[04:05:13] <FunkyBob> stop being purposefully obtuse
[04:05:24] <FunkyBob> why do these messages exist? what to they tell your django app?
[04:05:44] <wallbroken> each transaction (ADD item, DELETE item, UPDATE item) generates an event which is forwarded in a JSON message suing RabbitMQ
[04:05:58] <FunkyBob> still don't give a fuck that it's in JSON
[04:06:07] <FunkyBob> completely irrelevant  to the discussion
[04:06:32] <wallbroken> in JSON there is time, date, oject ID, object state, and some other fields
[04:06:34] <FunkyBob> so, they have a message bus sharing events about stock level changes?
[04:06:44] <FunkyBob> STILL DO NOT CARE THAT IT IS JSON
[04:07:09] <wallbroken> there are different kind of messages
[04:07:18] <FunkyBob> you said that... add/delete/update
[04:07:39] <wallbroken> the messages are handled from SAP application. YOu can say to that whatever you want
[04:07:45] <FunkyBob> don't care who nhandles it
[04:07:53] <FunkyBob> want to know what they _mean_
[04:08:01] <FunkyBob> why you listen to them... what they tell your system
[04:08:26] <FunkyBob> "My django system processes these messages so that .... ?"
[04:08:27] <FunkyBob> what?
[04:08:48] <wallbroken> one step back
[04:09:03] <wallbroken> in their database there are all the items contained in the DC
[04:09:18] <wallbroken> with all the proprety
[04:10:21] <wallbroken> so, what i want to do is to feed my local database on each DC from that database
[04:10:40] <wallbroken> then, tell them. manage the orders using django backoffice application
[04:10:54] <wallbroken> what i cannot do is to move their database elsewhere
[04:11:20] <FunkyBob> so... your system is going to follow along all the changes, trying to keep a duplicate stock list...
[04:11:45] <wallbroken> exactly
[04:12:02] <FunkyBob> ok
[04:12:13] <wallbroken> this is not a requirement. this is just my suggestion of how the model could be to reach the goal
[04:12:14] <FunkyBob> but you still believe you need multiple instances of your system?
[04:12:24] <FunkyBob> one for each DC?
[04:12:49] <wallbroken> well, i have no other choices
[04:12:53] <FunkyBob> why not?
[04:13:06] <FunkyBob> why can't you have one system, subscribed to all DCs?
[04:13:35] <wallbroken> because each DC is already existing and is using it's own software implementation
[04:13:43] <FunkyBob> so?
[04:13:48] <FunkyBob> your system is independent of them
[04:14:30] <wallbroken> so, your idea is to make that each DC will send the records to a single centralized database?
[04:15:10] <wallbroken> and each store will operate with one single backend?
[04:15:27] <FunkyBob> yes
[04:16:15] <wallbroken> ok, and the database will update each DC's database when an order is made then the item it will be no more available?
[04:16:36] *** Joins: majdal (~Adium@bras-base-toroon0954w-grc-68-142-113-221-148.dsl.bell.ca)
[04:16:43] <FunkyBob> is that how you submit orders?
[04:17:26] <wallbroken> well, django application will manage orders
[04:17:40] <wallbroken> but once the order has been done, each DB must keep track of that
[04:17:53] <wallbroken> well, not "each" but the involved database
[04:17:55] <rannnn8888> I have another query that I try to do without panic: D i want get specipic day and count How many times in 5 minute this the start https://bpa.st/A7IA

[10:44:01] <tamere> I have 2 applications, app1 and app2. I want to use a model from app1 in the model of app2 and a model of app2 in the model of app1
[10:44:07] <tamere> I have a circular dependency
[10:44:24] <tamere> I try to create an application called common to put all my models in it
[10:44:45] <tamere> But all the migrations are now broken so I think it's not the solution
[10:44:47] <serafeim> tamere: just put your imports inside the functions/methods you use them
[10:45:18] <dodo> tamere: was the code already deployed somewhere?
[10:45:38] <tamere> serafeim Yeah this solution is working indeed but is it a good practice?

[10:45:58] <serafeim> tamere: yes that's the proper way to resolve circular deps
[10:46:04] <tamere> @dodo Yeah the code is already deploy on a server and the database is in production so I can't remove it

[10:57:23] <pycode> hello everybody
[10:58:17] <pycode> is the timing correct? https://bpa.st/AGHA (signal) i read in the source code that the form_valid() save the object so i suppose i need to emit the event after
[10:59:01] <pycode> however that's not the real question, i know that i can emit event hacking the same method of the model, using save method i can understand if i need to emit "quote_created" or "quoted_updated"
[10:59:25] <pycode> the question is, what about if i have to deal with value modification? for example i have a field called "view"
[10:59:41] <pycode> i should emit "quote_view" when the value on db changes
[10:59:52] <pycode> should i put this logic inside the save?

[12:03:20] <pycode> FunkyBob, pardon? what do you mean exactly? override that method or use success_url =  reverse('representatives:quotes:edit', kwargs={'token':self.object.token})
[12:03:25] <pycode> but the last one i think is not correct
[12:04:07] <bSid> Hi. In libera chat is chat history not visible?
[12:04:18] <FunkyBob> pycode: no, the method is "get_success_url" as you said
[12:04:37] <FunkyBob> bSid: do you mean on  their web site?
[12:04:46] <FunkyBob> bSid: or your IRC client?
[12:04:56] <FunkyBob> typically, no, history doesn't persist
[12:05:02] <FunkyBob> pycode: what happened when you tried?
[12:05:03] <pycode> FunkyBob, i am seeing that i always do: https://bpa.st/FSIQ
[12:05:17] <pycode> FunkyBob, yes yes it works the "problem" is that i am putting that code on every view
[12:05:22] <pycode> so maybe i need a mixin
[12:05:28] <pycode> because it is not a simple reverse
[12:05:32] <pycode> i must add the kwargs
[12:06:06] <FunkyBob> that specific method wouldn't make sense in a lot of views...
[12:06:25] <FunkyBob> but yes, a mixin would be a good move... DRY
[12:06:40] <pycode> why? not? obviously with a different "success_url" sure
[12:06:47] <pycode> but i always use the token as parameter
[12:06:53] <pycode> so i must override i think
[12:07:40] <pycode> i havent found a solution i thoought about a custom attribute of the createview to specify the kwargs
[12:07:50] <pycode> but ok it is not a problem i will create that logic in a mixin

[14:50:22] <bananahead> Hey all. Quick questions for you all on class based views. I've been a FBV user for ever, but seeing some benefit in CBV's now, so attempting to transition some of my views to use them.
[14:50:54] <bananahead> If I wanted to check that some GET query params are set correctly, and if not return a 400 error, which method should I override to do that in?
[14:50:55] <serafeim> bananahead: you may wany to take a look at my tutorial here https://spapas.github.io/2018/03/19/comprehensive-django-cbv-guide/
[14:51:05] <serafeim> bananahead: dispatch
[14:51:44] <serafeim> bananahead: also take a look at the cbv inspector: https://ccbv.co.uk/
[14:51:53] <bananahead> serafeim: Thanks for the link. Most of the guides I've seen online are very basic.
[14:52:13] <serafeim> bananahead:  mine is not basic :)
[14:52:48] <bananahead> serafeim: That's exactly what I'm looking for!
[14:53:17] <serafeim> cool i hope it helps you. however keep in mind the cbv inspector. that's the most valuable tool when working with CBVs
[14:53:19] <bananahead> serafeim: yeah so I've read ccbv and followed all the code though. So code wise it makes sense. Its just the practical implementation questions I have now.

[14:55:57] <bananahead> serafeim: One more thing - the setup method, currently sets the self.args and self.kwargs. Are these the args/kwargs that are being pulled from the url itself. If I need query params, I will still need to use self.request.GET right?
[14:56:32] <serafeim> yes you will need to use self.rquest.GET
[14:56:48] <serafeim> at least that's what I do i'm not sure if it's available anywhere

[15:13:41] <apollo13> fraziern: django master does not support python 3.7
[15:14:10] <apollo13> ie django 4 support python 3.8+ only
[15:14:50] <serafeim> uh oh... centos 7.x has python 3.6.8

[15:18:13] <pycode> FunkyBob, pardon for the late response, ok i will create that mixin
[15:18:15] <apollo13> serafeim: 3.6 is EOL this year
[15:18:21] <pycode> but i must to implement a new attribute
[15:18:23] *** Joins: thiras_ (~thiras@user/thiras)
[15:18:31] <apollo13> and the latest django LTS will be supported for  awhile
[15:18:35] <pycode> to understand what reverse url i need to put there
[15:18:42] <apollo13> you cannot expect bleeding edge to supports EOL'ed pythons
[15:18:50] <serafeim> apollo13: and what do you think will happen to centos 7.x ?
[15:19:02] <apollo13> serafeim: what do you mean?
[15:19:13] <serafeim> will they upgrade their python3 ?
[15:19:16] <apollo13> there is centos 8 already and shorlty 9 coming
[15:19:20] <apollo13> knowing redhat I do not think so
[15:19:24] <serafeim> apollo13: me neither
[15:19:41] <serafeim> centos 7.x is supported until 2025 though
[15:19:42] <apollo13> fwiw we are afaik already outside of the normal rhel 7 support window
[15:20:26] <serafeim> in any case i guess i'd need to download and compile python 3.8.x manually
[15:20:43] <apollo13> that or software collections / epel
[15:20:46] <apollo13> if someone cares
[15:20:52] <apollo13> or you know, update your system
[15:21:00] <apollo13> or put it in a docker container
[15:21:07] <serafeim> apollo13: why update a supported system ?
[15:21:30] <apollo13> serafeim: well then stay with old software
[15:21:41] <apollo13> it is not like yum install python-django will get __newer__ on centos 7
[15:21:46] <apollo13> even though it is 'supported'
[15:22:03] <serafeim> yes ok
[15:22:18] <serafeim> i'll see what i will do when the django 4.0 time comes
[15:22:36] <apollo13> also redhat is going massively towards containers and at least with rhel 8 starting to their module system
[15:22:47] <apollo13> so I'd expect rhel 8 to get for instance python 3.11 at some point
[15:22:51] <fraziern> apollo13: thanks for the quick help, I'm all good now
[15:23:36] <serafeim> compiling and installing using altinstall should be fine without the need to use containers
[15:23:54] <serafeim> i was doing it for years in centos 6.x to support python 2.7
[15:24:07] <apollo13> so no problems thenâ€¦
[15:24:42] <serafeim> yes no problems just the uncertainity self-compiled code gives me
[15:24:53] <apollo13> uhm
[15:25:30] <apollo13> in that case I would not use centos either :D
[15:26:24] <serafeim> yes after the drama with centos 8 i don't know if i will ever use centos again
[15:27:08] <apollo13> Oh I was not refering to that, just in general that you probably want RHEL if you want a "supported" system configuration
[15:27:20] <serafeim> ah
[15:27:20] <apollo13> centos 8 stream is actually nice
[15:27:38] <serafeim> i haven't use it
[15:29:37] <apollo13> serafeim: c8/rhel8 has python 2.7, 3.6, 3.8 & 3.9
[15:29:56] <apollo13> and I am pretty sure 3.9 came as part of a feature update and not in the initial release (I doubt it existed there)
[15:30:42] <apollo13> and given the performance improvements with 3.10 onwards (if the plans go through) I guess for some it might make financial sense to upgrade sooner rather than later

[18:57:00] <bananahead> node1: Database design will help in future. But you pick that up as you go. Start out with the tutorials and start is the best option
[18:57:25] <b-rex> yeah just do it. you'll learn as you go
[18:58:06] <node1> I did whatever documentation said. Now i don't know where to look for? And to do what next?
[18:58:27] <bananahead> What are you trying to do?
[18:58:49] <node1> Just learning django and turning it into micoservices.
[18:59:31] <node1> But i'm looking for a some intern or paid project where i can demonstrate my working skill.
[18:59:59] <bananahead> If you have finished the tutorial, you should be in a position to start building your service. If not follow one of these online youtube tutorials. I find them helpful in the early stages
[19:01:25] <node1> ok
