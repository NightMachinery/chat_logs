[14:32:10] <duoi> hey, been a while since ive used django forms
[14:32:32] <duoi> is there a way to add additional fields to a form's cleaned_data during inside the clean method?
[14:33:20] <GinFuyou> I think so? Is not it just a dict?

[14:36:11] <duoi> whats best practice when it comes to saving forms
[14:36:16] <duoi> do i just declare a save or create method and call that?
[14:36:20] <duoi> (on the form)
[14:36:37] <duoi> sorry, i know, but i havent touched django forms for >5 years haha
[14:37:52] <ktosiek[m]> ModelForms have a save method, I'd probably mirror that.

[14:47:23] <FunkyBob> adding extra values to a ModelForms' cleaned_data dict will NOT update more fields
[14:48:20] <duoi> this is not a model form, just a run of the mill form.Form, does that still cause issues?
[14:49:03] <FunkyBob> in that caseit's irrelevant, since it has no save method
[14:50:16] <FunkyBob> what are you doing with the data once it's cleaned?
[14:51:03] <duoi> FunkyBob saving it eventually. this is a dynamic form that accepts n number of rows. i'm constructing the data type the way i want and bulk creating the outcome.
[14:51:54] <FunkyBob> sounds like a formset
[14:51:59] <FunkyBob> N rows of t he same fields in each row?
[14:52:21] <duoi> yep
[14:52:51] <FunkyBob> formset

[20:51:08] <millerthegorilla> Hi, I am using multi table inheritance.  I have an app that extends from another app, and a profile model in each one.  The profile is attached via a foreign key to the user model when a user is created using a signal which I disconnect and reattach in the subclass.  I can succesfully obtain the fields in the profile subclass using
[20:51:09] <millerthegorilla> user.profile.field but in the template I am forced to use user.profile.profile.field.  Is there a way in the template to access the complete array of subclass fields using user.profile rather than user.profile.profile?

[22:46:04] <BlahBlah> If I would write the query I would just use the pk of the first in the relationship table to get them all. But since the model stuff does that intern I should probably use a specific function for it?
