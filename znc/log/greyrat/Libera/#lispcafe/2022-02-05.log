[05:03:28] <gilberth> I would add a corollary and that is people trying to fit into a group in contrast to be born into one. You see that in e.g. people having no own taste about music or fashion. And also is people buying [consuming] or owning things just because they neighbors do. But that is a topic I personally like to make fun of about.

[09:48:36] <hayley> Yep.
[09:48:46] <hayley> (expt x 1/2) == (sqrt x) 
[09:48:46] <moon-child> mfiano: x^(p/q) is the qth root of x^p

[09:49:36] <mfiano> Hmm ok thanks
[09:50:24] <hayley> moon-child: Yeah, but then I'd have to aggregate from the pairs to get the resultant forces, and idk how to do that so efficiently. 
[09:50:41] * hayley wonders how terrible having an atom -> bonds that affect atom map is in practise.
[09:51:31] * moon-child doesn't really feel like looking into it atm, maybe later though
[09:51:44] <hayley> No stress.

[09:52:27] <hayley> IIRC the author was also an entitled bitch, saying smth like "gimme multithreading" like anyone would dare to parallelise their trash code.
[09:53:02] <moon-child> oof
