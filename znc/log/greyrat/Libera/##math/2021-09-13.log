[00:24:26] <riv> it doesn't depend on any details of P
[00:24:44] <riv> it's just that x ranges over every number and so does y - alpha

[03:37:24] <[itchyjunk]> problem statement here : https://i.ibb.co/QY1Q8WK/image.png
[03:37:55] <[itchyjunk]> congruent means equal?
[03:38:04] <[itchyjunk]> "identical in form; coinciding exactly when superimposed."
[03:38:07] <[itchyjunk]> according to google
[03:38:27] <greenbagels> yes, congruent means identical up to rotation, reflection, and translation
[03:38:38] <greenbagels> (loosely speaking)
[03:38:39] <[itchyjunk]> hmm i still don't understand what HL means though
[03:38:41] <[itchyjunk]> oh i see
[03:38:47] <[itchyjunk]> makes sense
[03:39:27] <[itchyjunk]> i am guessing HL stands for some theorem abbrivation or somesuch..
[03:39:30] <[itchyjunk]> HL congruent.
[03:41:31] <buster> doesn't seem very profitable to ask us to guess. could you point us to the start of this material, or its index page?

[03:43:03] <[itchyjunk]> that's the link i found i don't have any other context
[03:43:11] <[itchyjunk]> HL means hypotenuese leg
[03:43:25] <[itchyjunk]> "hypotenuese leg" theorem
[03:43:27] <greenbagels> https://www.mathopenref.com/congruenthl.html
[03:43:30] <greenbagels> yeah this is what i found
[03:43:54] <buster> that's nicer
[03:44:00] <greenbagels> i did not know about this theorem, huh.
[03:44:22] <biberao> its congruent
[03:44:22] <[itchyjunk]> i don't know about almost any of this
[03:44:25] <greenbagels> makes sense though if you use pythagorean theorem and SSS
[03:44:34] <[itchyjunk]> my prof casually said to refer to euclids elements but the books are huge
[03:44:44] <biberao> [itchyjunk]: so you figured the angles?
[03:45:02] <[itchyjunk]> yeah the last problem i figured out (thanks to Mr. Khan).
[03:45:08] <buster> (the green are opposite, alternate is what biberao said)
[03:45:26] <[itchyjunk]> wait wut
[03:45:28] <biberao> buster: i said opv opposed by the vertex
[03:45:30] <biberao> or something
[03:45:34] <biberao> atleast in my language
[03:45:52] <[itchyjunk]> one outside one inside in the same side is alternate?
[03:45:59] <biberao> [itchyjunk]: no
[03:46:04] <buster> biberao, yeah. we say opposite.
[03:46:09] <biberao> there are exterior alternate and interior alternate
[03:46:15] <buster> [itchyjunk]: no
[03:46:24] <buster> biberao: totally
[03:46:28] <biberao> some ppl call cointerior
[03:46:30] <biberao> or something
[03:47:07] <biberao> buster: it seems its opposite by the vertex not opposed

[03:48:28] <biberao> ok
[03:48:30] <biberao> that too
[03:48:41] <biberao> maybe i was mixing my language with english
[03:48:41] <buster> latin, huh

[08:24:11] <droid3> ok tonight topic pells equation
[08:26:18] <droid3> question 1) with Brahmagupta's identity and Chakravala_method we can solve the pell equation reasonable well.
[08:27:08] <droid3> However how does one know he has enumerated all the fundamental solutions that generate all the solutions????
[08:28:49] <droid3> Currently i can program my computer to solve pells equation using Chakravala_method but this gives me an infinite set of solution but not necessarily all the solutions.
[08:29:46] <droid3> Is there anyway to prove or make sure the computer generates all sets?
[08:31:47] <droid3> 2) If i dont use Chakravala_method and go with just using continued fraction approximations to sqrt(D)  where x^2-Dy^2=1

[08:54:06] <Galois> to say that the fundamental solution generates all the solutions, is the same thing as to say that the group of units in Z[sqrt(d)] is cyclic
[08:54:14] <droid3> maybe the solutions do all form a group using Brahmagupta identity it seems they would be closed under a sort of group multiplication
[08:54:44] <droid3> but its hard to see inverses and hard to see that its truely the group of nth roots of unity or something connected to that line of reasoning yet for me?
[08:54:57] <Galois> the inverse of x+sqrt(d)y is x-sqrt(d)y
[08:55:56] <Galois> the basic argument goes like this. x^2 - dy^2 = 1 means x/y (or -x/y) is very very close to sqrt(d), which means that the slope of (x,y) is heavily constrained
[08:55:58] <droid3> O i see ya group of units when thinking of it in Z[sqrt(d)]
[08:56:30] <Galois> if x is made bigger, then y must be made bigger, in direct proportion to x, because the slope is so severely constrained by having to be close to sqrt(d)
[08:56:32] <droid3> yes that true but how do you even know its cyclic group for all the solution indeed i think its not generate in general by only one fundemental solution maybe i am wrong though?
[08:56:51] <Galois> so you can linearly order all the solutions by the values of x
[08:56:59] <Galois> and that same order will also have all of the y's in order
[08:57:36] <Galois> the fundamental solution is, by definition, the smallest nontrivial solution (x=1, y=0 is the trivial solution)
[08:58:15] <Galois> if (IF) the powers of the fundamental solution didn't hit all the solutions, then you would have a solution in between two powers, say the n-th power and the (n+1)-th power

[08:58:52] <Galois> since it's a linearly ordered group, you can translate along the powers of the fundamental solution
[08:59:22] <Galois> translating the in-between solution by n steps backward, you obtain a new solution which is between the 0th power and the 1-st power of the fundamental solution
[08:59:25] <droid3> ok give me a second to think about the last few statements
[08:59:45] <Galois> being less than the 1st power of the fundamental solution, it is thereby a smaller nontrivial solution

[09:01:23] <Galois> there's just not that many ways to have an abelian group with a total linear order

[09:02:35] <pikapika> Funny
[09:03:05] <pikapika> Galois, I was thinking of roots of unity right now
[09:03:08] <pikapika> Interesting coincidence
[09:03:33] <droid3> Ya its like infinite decent proof of fermat neat so if you can order the solutions as you say then surely you proved it.
[09:03:55] <Galois> it's a combination of 1) total linear ordering, 2) abelian group structure, 3) discrete
[09:03:55] <droid3> But its not so clear still about the ordering part to me.
[09:04:12] <Galois> (discrete because Z[sqrt(d)] is discrete, in the correct topology of course)
[09:04:40] <Galois> ordering is fairly simple. The solutions are (x,y). Plot them. They're all close to the line x = y sqrt(d)

[09:09:35] <Galois> by the way these are still units, since if x^2-dy^2 = -1 then (x+sqrt(d)) divides -1, so it's still a unit
[09:09:39] <droid3> Ok talk later with you Galois as -1 i can still use the method like continued fractions and Chakravala method to solve them.
[09:09:49] <Galois> the issue is that -1 sometimes isn't a quadratic residue mod d

[10:57:22] <xaltsc> hajonnes: a relation is.... a relation. It does not have any other meaning if you don't precise where you work. What you describe, for instance, can be an equivalence relations of elements in a set, but could be another kind of equivalence (like an equivalence of categories, or even equipotency of sets, isomorphism classes, whether in CT or MT).

[11:15:50] <greenbagels> the actual definition is anything that satisfies those three properties

I will give you an example form the book. x ≡ y, iif: x mod 3 = y mod 3, then 2 ≡ 5, 12 ≡ 0,0 ≡ 36.

[11:37:52] <xaltsc> 1 < 1 is false.
[11:38:42] <hajonnes> xaltsc, also they must uphold transitivity with  ≡  and not with = because = is well defined and  ≡  we can define as we want?
[11:38:44] <xaltsc> I must have forgotten an axiom since <= is not an equivalence relation either
[11:39:03] <xaltsc> We can define = as we want as well
[11:39:14] <greenbagels> (this is related to objects called "equivalence classes". they are exhaustive subsets of elements that all satisfy the given equivalence relation --- in this sense, {x : x = 1 mod 3}, {x : x = 2 mod 3}, {x : x = 3 mod 3} are the three equivalence classes defined by your relation)
[11:39:44] <greenbagels> (you can consider these three classes as red numbers, green numbers, and blue numbers, if you still want to use the color analogy)
[11:40:03] <xaltsc> The axiom I've forgotten for an equivalence relation is symetry. If a = b then b = a must hold.
[11:40:38] <xaltsc> <= is not an equivalence relation because 3 <= 5 but we don't have 5 <= 3
[11:42:04] <hajonnes> xaltsc, yes. that was the three they defined in the book. but why say that  ≡  is a relation. I think of a relation as a funciton from S1 to S2 where one element in S1 can have many elements in S2, how does  ≡  fit that?
[11:42:26] <hajonnes> where S1 and S2 are sets.
[11:43:08] <xaltsc> A relation is a function from S_1\times S_2 to true or false, depending on whether the relation holds or not.
[11:43:26] <xaltsc> It's not usual to compare two elements from different sets though.
[11:44:00] <greenbagels> hajonnes: your definition is related to xaltsc's definition; your function from S1 to S2 defines pairs (s1, s2) of elements in S1 x S2
[11:44:13] <greenbagels> this is exactly the set of elements that map to true in xaltsc's definition

[12:16:14] <[-_-]> oh....
[12:17:47] <greenbagels> Fairy97: the way you would show this is by saying you can give a formula (x(t),y(t)) that is piecewise smooth and traces out your curve as t varies from 0 to 1
[12:18:04] <greenbagels> and that there are (at least) two distinct t that give the same (x,y)

[16:52:52] <Z-module> [itchyjunk]: a thing you might not have realized is that the spiral never connects back to itself, so when theta hits 2pi (full circle), the region they mean as being "enclosed" by it also has the positive x-axis as a boundary line. See  https://www.desmos.com/calculator/qq1xzhusai    It's a funny/irregular shape being enclosed.

[17:32:33] <Z-module> [itchyjunk]: there's no continuous (much less entire) complex function defined on all of C or even on all of C\{0} that gives one choice of log value everywhere.  You have to remove an infinite ray starting from 0, such as the set of all non-positive reals, and then on *that* remaining domain you can define a single-valued log in an analytic way.
[17:33:19] <Z-module> same for a single-valued sqrt
[17:33:40] <[itchyjunk]> one tiny little ray messes it all up, amazing
[17:34:03] <PlanckWalk> Well, it's more that every loop messes it up
[17:34:06] <[itchyjunk]> but i guess cardinality of the ray and the rest is same?
[17:34:26] <[itchyjunk]> so not really tiny
[17:34:27] <PlanckWalk> So you need to cut every loop.  A ray is one way of doing that.
[17:34:51] <[itchyjunk]> oh i see it prevents any other loop at all

[18:03:45] <rubiksdream> if D is simply connected and open in C, and f : D -> C is holomorphic, s.t. f is never zero anywhere in D, I can define a single-valued branch of f^{1/2} on D, and there are precisely two of these, f^{1/2} and -f^{1/2}, i am wondering if it is true that Im(f^{1/2}) is necessarily contained in an open half-plane

[19:30:47] <Z-module> which is 360 (not 320)

[19:36:24] <Z-module> Well, do we know if each pair of stripes must be differently colored?  You would assume so, in a real-life situation.
[19:36:32] <Z-module> each pair of adjacent stripes, rather
[19:37:09] <buster> rubiksdream, hint: think of w = (z-z₀)/(z-z₁) as a transformation of the complex plane. what does it do to z₀, z₁ and Ω?
[19:37:35] <cadmio> yes I know that the total configurations are r^p so color is chosen at will

[19:39:38] <cadmio> so I've to count the number of orbits also in this case and use the class equation
[19:40:02] <Z-module> cadmio, all "cup rotations" of a given stripe coloring are still the same coloring, so the group doing the acting here is C_p  (cyclic)

[19:43:13] <Z-module> yes, under addition mod p, that is cyclic
[19:44:02] <rubiksdream> buster I can see it sends z_0 to 0, z_1 to infinity, and by conformality everything in the left-half plane with normal the (directed) segment [z_0,z_1] must be sent to some half plane

[19:47:00] <int-e> rubiksdream: how does it behave on the forbidden line?
[19:47:24] <Z-module> but in this case, the "people" are only colors, and one yellow strip can't be distinguished from another yellow stripe
[19:47:56] <Z-module> I guess we do ignore the need for adjacent stripes to be different colors here. So in fact all the stripes could be the same color.
[19:48:13] <Z-module> (in the real world, that would never be used)
[19:49:04] <int-e> Z-module: the stripes could be made thinner?
[19:49:26] <rubiksdream> hmm, is the forbidden line [z_0,z_1]? I think it would send points on this line to points on the line {Im(z) = 0, Re(z) <= 0}?
[19:49:32] <int-e> (so you'd alternate between a chosen color and white)
[19:49:47] <Z-module> Well, they don't spell it out. FOr this idealized type of math problem, you clearly assume equal-size stripes that can each get any color at all, independent of all the other colors chosen.
[19:50:09] <Z-module> oh I see, maybe that could happen, yeah
[19:50:43] <int-e> rubiksdream: yeah. Which is relevant, because, speaking intuitively, that's a line in the image you cannot cross when Omega is the source.
[19:50:52] <rubiksdream> oh, hmm, so that is excluded.. in which case the image of our square root can't possibly contain more than a 180-degree span of angles?
[19:51:26] <cadmio> this is the first time I consider the action of Z_n usually in these problem S_n or D_n is employed
[19:51:50] <rubiksdream> uh sorry, ignore what I said
[19:51:59] <Z-module> cadmio: well, in your case here, Z_p has no proper nontrivial subgroups at all (since p is prime). That simplifies everything.
[19:52:02] <rubiksdream> yes, but i think i get the idea

[19:53:20] <rubiksdream> oh no, i think what i said sort of makes sense? If it did include more than a 180-degree span of angles (excuse the informal speak) then i would hit something on that line, no?
[19:53:35] <rubiksdream> i just square my square root and hit that line

[22:59:46] <Simplar> Three judges judge participants of a contest. Judge #1 votes fairly with probability p (0 < p <= 1). Judge #2 follows the same rule independently. Judge #3 throws a coin to make a decision. The final decision is determined by the majority of votes. If this final decision isn't fair, what's the probability that it's Judge #3's fault?
[23:00:42] *** Quits: dextaa2 (~dextaa@user/dextaa) (Quit: The Lounge - https://thelounge.chat)
[23:01:07] <Simplar> My thoughts are: throwing a coin gives two equiprobable outcomes: heads or tails.

[23:03:49] *** Quits: hanif_ (~hanif@gateway/tor-sasl/hanif) (Quit: quit)
[23:05:12] <Z-module> It depends on whether there's a goat behind that door.
[23:05:56] <Inline> lol
[23:05:58] <somiaj> so (1-p) is the probablity of judge 1 or 2 being wrong? and 0.5 is the probablity of judge 3 being wrong?
[23:06:09] <Simplar> somiaj: correct
[23:06:10] <somiaj> or I guess not 'voting fairly'
[23:06:11] <cherim> Judge 1 is a goat with probability 0<p<=1. He can be definitely a goat, but we can never exclude this possibility (p>0)
[23:06:12] <qergle> Simplar: when is judge #3's vote relevant?
[23:06:29] <W> Also, there's an ambiguity; by "fault" do you mean if judge #3 had judged fairly it would have changed the outcome to be fair? Or merely that they did not vote for the fair outcome, regardless of whether that made a difference?
[23:06:48] <Simplar> qergle: when one of the others votes fairly, and another one of the others votes unfairly
[23:06:58] <qergle> right, so limit yourself to that case
[23:07:08] <somiaj> Also might want to define 'fault', does 'fault' assume if the judge didn't flipt the coin they were always fair, or would they have the standard fair with probablity p
[23:07:45] <Simplar> so the probability is p*(1-p)*0.5 ?
[23:07:52] <qergle> close
[23:08:01] <Simplar> one fair, one unfair, third one has 0.5 chance to be unfair
[23:08:13] <Simplar> oh wait, there is one more
[23:08:17] <qergle> is there only one way for "one fair, one unfair"?
[23:08:19] <Simplar> where first one is unfair
[23:08:24] <Simplar> and second one is fair
[23:08:31] <Simplar> 2*p*(1-p)*0.5
[23:08:37] <qergle> agree
[23:08:54] <Simplar> So I must factor in ALL the outcomes?
[23:09:07] <Simplar> Which satisfy the condition
[23:09:36] <cherim> It's also a proof that p(1-p)<=1/2 since you can't be to blame if the coin was fair

[23:49:04] <riv> yes
[23:49:44] <riv> if you can write a computer program that terminates on all its inputs, that is a computable function
[23:50:04] <riv> formally you can define a kind of programming language that only works with natural numbers - and is has a 'mu' minimization operator
[23:50:21] <riv> or you can define turing machines, which operate on infinitely long tapes
[23:50:38] <riv> or you can define lambda calculus, and represent natural numbers using church encoding
[23:50:40] <[itchyjunk]> a program that terminates on all it's input... while (true) {}
[23:50:43] <[itchyjunk]> doesn't terminate though
[23:50:58] <riv> it needs to be a function, not just a block of code
[23:51:05] <riv> so function f(x) { while(true) {} }
[23:51:08] <riv> does not terminate on all inputs
[23:51:39] <riv> the above 3 different ways to define programming languages are all capable of writing interpreters for each other
[23:51:50] <riv> e.g. you can implement a lambda calculus reducer in a turing machine
[23:52:05] <riv> and you can implement a turing machine tape using lambda calculus lists and write an interpreter for it
[23:52:19] <riv> that is what turing equivalence is
[23:53:02] <[itchyjunk]> I think I understand this a bit better, thanks

[23:59:06] <[itchyjunk]> riv since we are on the topic, do you know what a program is? in the context of curry haword correspondence
[23:59:28] <[itchyjunk]> there is a correspondence between programs and proofs. I can guess what proof means but not programms
