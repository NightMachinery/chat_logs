[14:06:13] <nerozero> hi, didn't found a proper channel for gnu ed (not sed), can I ask ed question here ?

[14:15:40] <Soliton> ed is being suggested here occasionally.
[14:41:11] <nerozero> Thank you... could you please help me write a script for ed to replace value in quotes with new values: OPT_NAME = "VALUE1 VALUE2" 
[14:41:22] <nerozero> don't want to use sed -i... 
[14:42:00] <nerozero> the string inside quotes can contain any characters except quotes 
[14:42:47] <lopid> ed -s /tmp/file <<< $'s/"\([^"]\+\)"/"foo"/\nw'
[14:43:37] <lopid> or * if there may be nothing in quotes
[14:44:09] <nerozero> can I use pcre in ed ? 
[14:44:23] <nerozero> i guess only BRE or ERE
[14:44:31] <lopid> no
[14:45:05] <lopid> just bre
[14:45:16] <nerozero> the issue is that the OPT_NAME = "OLD VALUE" # comment 
[14:45:33] <nerozero> OPT_NAME - is the key here 
[14:46:07] <lopid> you can add that to the pattern and replacement
[14:46:20] <nerozero> yes but it doesn't seems to work 
[14:46:51] <lopid> what are you trying?
[14:49:35] <nerozero> exactly this , instead of /tmp/file - the test file which contains some OPT_NAME1 OPT_NAME2 .... lines 
[14:51:03] <lopid> so you want to match different patterns?
[14:51:31] <nerozero> so the file content is : https://bsd.to/7Fut
[14:51:49] <nerozero> the idea is to change value in quotes for some options 
[14:52:33] <nerozero> say all OPT_NAME1 values should be set to: OPT_NAME1 = "new1 new1_other ...."
[14:54:08] <lopid> $'g/OPT_NAME1 = /s/"\([^"]\+\)"/"foo"/\nw
[14:54:11] <lopid> '
[14:55:40] <nerozero> lopid, thank you so much!!!!! 
[14:55:45] <lopid> or just match OPT_NAME1 in the earlier command
[14:56:26] <nerozero> Thank you !!!! 
[14:56:31] <lopid> you're welcome

[16:35:44] <stevenm_> What might be the easiest way of adding a prefix to a string... if it's missing?
[16:36:56] <stevenm_> e.g. you might be given '/blah' or 'blah.com' or 'http://blah.com' (or ftp://, or ssh:// or any other URI thinkable)
[16:37:15] <stevenm_> and I'm hoping to add http:// only if it's *not* got a / at the start or any other URI schema
[16:37:40] <stevenm_> I've at least figured out I can match the URI schema with... [a-Z][a-Z0-9+.-]*:\/\/

[16:52:11] <stevenm_> probably a bit crude adding the http:// in all circumstances and then removing it again if it wasn't needed - but it seems simple enough
[16:52:46] <Soliton> beautiful cargo cult.

[17:12:07] <earnestly> Why remove the schema if one exists?
[17:12:29] <stevenm_> it doesn't
[17:12:30] <earnestly> Only to potentially add back the incorrect one
[17:12:39] <stevenm_> no you're read that wrong
[17:12:49] <earnestly> The sed script is doing exactly that

[17:19:25] <stevenm_> well it certainly doesn't do what you said at the start, when you said it removed an existing schema to replace it with an incorrect one
[17:19:40] <Soliton> it's clearly cargo cult. there is no visible attempt at understanding.
[17:19:47] <stevenm_> in fact it does the opposite, it removes the schema it added if it notices a valid one already after that
[17:19:56] <stevenm_> Soliton, cargo cut?!
[17:19:59] <Soliton> like one colon is escaped and not he other.
[17:20:26] <stevenm_> oh that's because I was trying to dump it into dconf - I don't need that
[17:20:47] <Soliton> you know random rearrangement of stuff until it throws no error.
