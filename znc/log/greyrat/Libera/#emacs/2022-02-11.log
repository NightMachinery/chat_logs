[04:51:12] <bobdobbs`> I'm getting used to a slightly adjusted workflow with spacemacs. For git I've set my editor to be emacs. I'm having trouble when I try to commit.
[04:51:16] *** Quits: serbest (~ike@user/serbest) (Quit: Konversation terminated!)
[04:51:50] <bobdobbs`> When I do 'git commit -a' emacs opens. I write my message. Usually I then just kill the buffer and that's that.
[04:53:11] <bobdobbs`> However, at the moment when I try to kill the buffer I get a message saying "don't kill this buffer... Instead cancel with 'C-c C-k "
[04:53:34] <bobdobbs`> So I do that instead. But after doing that my changes aren't committed.
[04:54:26] <bpalmer> bobdobbs`: if you do C-x C-s and then quit , ignoring that message, does it work?
[04:55:02] <bobdobbs`> no
[04:55:11] <bpalmer> bobdobbs`: (I suspect this is magit or something and it wants you to C-c C-c to commit to it; C-c C-k would cancel it. Not based on using magit, but because C-c C-c is usually the "go forward" binding)
[04:55:31] <bobdobbs`> I'm not using magit
[04:55:41] <bpalmer> bobdobbs`: I understand you're not trying to use it.
[04:55:58] <bobdobbs`> oh. It might be running anyway?
[04:56:00] <bpalmer> type C-h v major-mode RET to see the mode you're in, C-h m to see bindings, in the buffer after it starts up.
[04:56:01] <bobdobbs`> I'll just uninstall it
[04:56:19] <bpalmer> bobdobbs`: I'm suspecting that spacemacs has configured something for git commit messages.
[04:56:45] <bpalmer> don't uninstall it based on my guess, do the major-mode , C-h m  or just try pressing C-c C-c and see if that helps.

[05:03:09] <jmercouris> so C-u toggles the prefix argument I take it

[05:03:45] <jmercouris> yes, I just checked it
[05:03:46] <bpalmer> jmercouris: so it acts as a delimiter if present.

[07:21:49] <rnkn> if anyone would like to have a look at function `window-toggle-side-windows' I'm pretty sure this is problematic code; it seems like when it's restoring side windows it's just smushing the previous window state onto some windows to make new side windows, which I'm pretty sure bypasses any window management code, i.e. `split-window'
[07:23:44] *** Parts: chrisb_ (~chrisb@user/chrisb) ()
[07:24:54] <rnkn> I'm speculating but I really think this code should save side windows as an frame parameter alist each with their own display parameters, then call `display-buffer-in-side-window' for each
[07:26:00] <rnkn> in short, I think `window-state-put' is a much too low-level function to call here and it's causing bugz

[10:57:16] <twb> A daemon by any other name would conjure and abjure just as well
[10:58:31] <corwin> in fact, it's not like it won't take the --daemon command line arg, but rather runemacs.exe, the wrapper we use to avoid a useless cmd shell window, doesn't.  I suspect it works but doesn't offer much vs using server+emacsclient (the latter of which has it's own emacsclientw.exe).

[11:00:26] <corwin> "most"  sorry twb.  I'm tired.
[11:01:06] <twb> corwin: it's actually conhost, not cmd
[11:01:17] <twb> conhost = windows xterm
[11:01:50] <corwin> huh, from the MinGW env I'm using to build this, I presume?
[11:01:53] <twb> Now that conhost is replaced by Terminal in windows, can Emacs just not fire conhost at all anymore?  It's annoying because "open with emacs" behaves weirdly
[11:02:06] <corwin> oh.  huh.
[11:02:20] <twb> corwin: no conhost is built into windows as a low-level thing since like 2000 or NT4
[11:02:47] <twb> corwin: when you do like ⌘r cmd RET, that actually runs cmd (the shell) inside conhost (the terminal emulator)

[13:53:15] <tatsumaru> I am reading an ebook called "Mastering Emacs" which claims that unlike Emacs' buffer-based feature, most text editors are file-based and display from a file. Is that really true though? Almost every editor I've used offers the feature to create a "new file" without saving it anywhere and it only exists within that editor unless you save it to make it persistent. Atom for example has a "new window" which launches with an "untitled" buffer
[13:53:15] <tatsumaru> ? in it. Isn't that the same like a buffer basically?
[13:53:25] <zeta_0[m]> does emacs-27.2 support pure-gtk? that's the version of emacs that I'm currently using. If not then I'll have to upgrade, but I don't want to upgrade to emacs 28 or higher, because those versions are unstable.
[13:54:24] <tatsumaru> That being said I think you need to save it as a file in order to activate the language-specific features and addons.

[18:19:46] <artefact> you don't have to enable pgtk, runs fine without it
[18:20:59] <Unicorn_Princess> hm. package-install commands persist between emacs -q runs? so if i put (package-install 'lsp-mode) into an init.el (that i load manually), on 2nd run i should expect a "lsp-mode is already installed" message?
[18:21:53] <artefact> emacs -q is not a sandbox. it just skips init.el
[18:22:28] <corwin> emacs can't update your configuration when running under -q so installing packages when running that way is likely a bad idea.  That said, -q won't stop it from downloading the package, byte/native compiling, etc.
