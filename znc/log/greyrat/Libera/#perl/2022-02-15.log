[00:48:23] <leitz> Apologies for the dumb question, but it's late afternoon and my brain is fried. How do I escape '+' in a regex, since '\+' doesn't seem to be cutting it?
[00:48:36] <LeoNerd> \+ should be fine. If you don't believe that works then something else is going on
[00:49:06] <leitz> The actual match should be:   $setting_actual =~ m/^-ALL +TLSv1.2$/ix
[00:49:06] <LeoNerd> eval: say "YES" if "does this match a literal +?" =~ m/literal \+/
[00:49:08] <perlbot> LeoNerd: YES 
[00:49:12] <LeoNerd> ^--
[00:49:58] <leitz> LeoNerd, I can get the match to "/-ALL +/, and it's good. Once I add the T after +, or the \ before the "t", it fails.
[00:50:20] <LeoNerd> Yes. That has matched one-or-more spaces. ` +`
[00:50:33] <leitz> Sadly, the library I'm using gobbles any trouble-shooting. I print the actual match, and it's the same.
[00:51:35] <leitz> Ah, so " +\+TLS" may work.
[00:51:47] *** Joins: fling (~fling@user/fling)
[00:52:09] <LeoNerd> Oh don't forget that with the /x flag, spaces are ignored. So to match some space you need to escape it or use \s or somesuch
[00:52:57] <leitz> I think I'll put in \s+ just so the next person knows what's going on.
[00:53:16] <LeoNerd> Sounds good
[00:53:24] <leitz> Thanks!

[15:04:43] <vague> Yer too late. I censored myself though :P
[15:06:06] <Altreus> Is there a sneaky way I can implement --help in my script, without downgrading all my use lines to requires? Cos I'm using modules that take a while to compile and --help doesn't need any of it
[15:06:30] <Altreus> I guess I could GetOptions for --help in a BEGIN
[15:08:30] <tm604> or something lighter-weight
[15:08:33] <tm604> BEGIN { use Pod::Usage; use Opt::imistic; pod2usage() if exists $ARGV{'--help'} } perhaps
[15:08:46] <Altreus> hehe, install other modules?
[15:08:59] <Altreus> Opt::Imistic sounds good - someone should write that
[15:09:21] <tm604> that too, if you have one of those fancy case-sensitive filesystems
[15:09:24] <Altreus> In truth this is literally the exact use case I had for it
[15:09:34] <Altreus> well the exact middle of the scope
[15:09:36] <Altreus> You get the idea
[15:10:01] <huf> eh, why not just do an LD_PRELOAD?
[15:10:07] <huf> at leat you wouldnt have to touch fucking perl again :D
[15:10:16] <huf> and it's fast! also no cpan
[15:11:48] <Altreus> no perl? Why stop there? What if I could never touch a computer again!
[15:12:21] <huf> yaaas
[15:14:21] <japh> I abuse LD_PRELOAD to differentiate stderr from stdout output, it's great
[15:14:41] <japh> should find more usecases for abusing it
[15:15:07] <japh> abusecases
[15:15:31] <Altreus> you should blog or at least tweet about them
[15:15:36] <Altreus> #abusecase
[15:15:44] <Altreus> That could be a trend!
[15:16:08] <LeoNerd> I have a tiny LD_PRELOAD hack that just claims stdin/stdout are always a tty; which usually turns off stdout buffering

[15:17:05] <ens> i have made a .pm in lib. e.g. lib/thingy.pm, i'm trying to use it from a perlscript in the above directory ./script.pl but it can't find the package.
[15:17:26] <ens> do i have to do the thing where i push onto @INC in a BEGIN block, or is there a better way?
[15:18:08] <LeoNerd> Try actuallly installing it and using it for real, rather than hacking it
[15:18:22] <ens> no it's my own module
[15:18:32] <hethw> okay. I have a test, and I'm testing a script. I execute it with do: do 'script.pl'; all good. but, in the script there is while (<STDIN>) {} and the tests stop before that one and waits for something, what is it waiting for?
[15:19:08] <hethw> if there is no stdin, it should just continue, no?
[15:19:25] <LeoNerd> There's almost always a STDIN
[15:19:39] <LeoNerd> Unless you -specifically- close it (bad idea), or direct it in from  </dev/null  or somesuch
[15:20:00] <hethw> if I comment #while (<STDIN>) everything is good
[15:23:46] <aquanight> while (<STDIN>) reads lines from standard input. If you haven't redirected it, that means it's reading from the terminal.
[15:25:10] <hethw> well Test::Most probably redirects it somewhere else, since typing in the terminal does nothing
[15:25:25] <hethw> but it should be closed after some point, and the while will end, no?
[15:25:56] <aquanight> if it's a while loop it'll keep waiting until the "end-of-file"
[15:26:01] <aquanight> try doing a CTRL+D
[15:26:14] <hethw> great.
[15:26:17] <hethw> that's doing it
[15:26:28] <hethw> how can I ctrl+D inside the test :)
[15:26:48] <aquanight> without redirecting STDIN you really can't
[15:27:02] <aquanight> I don't think Test::Most or anything like it forks
[15:27:14] <aquanight> so there's nothing to drive the back end of STDIN
[15:27:22] <aquanight> your best bet is to </dev/null
[15:27:39] <hethw> sounds good

[20:00:02] <sandor> I'm using Moo to generate a class which has a database handle as an attribute.Â  Using `builder` works as expected, however I can't figure out how to use my own sub with `reader`.Â  I want to intercept calls to get the handle, so I can test it for validity before passing it back to the caller.Â  Can someone point me in the right direction?

[20:45:09] <ether> dbh should never be saved as an attribute anyway. you should save the thing that you use to get the dbh, which can reconnect for you automatically if needed, or return the still-connected dbh
[20:45:24] <ether> therefore, use DBIx::Class or DBIx::Connector
[20:51:13] <Grinnz> other than in tiny one-off scripts (and even then, because it's easy) you should always use a connection manager, which can be stored and passed between forks and will create a new connection whenever needed

[22:42:17] <SpiceMan> I mean. he worked years in embedded software. then again Japan is a weird place were non-technical people are programmers.
[22:42:35] <buZz> embedded as in hermit?
[22:42:39] <buZz> :D
[22:42:45] <SpiceMan> their code suck. things work because of the sheer man-power they throw at it.
[22:43:46] <SpiceMan> as in semiconductor. firmwares and stuff
[22:44:20] <buZz> it was a farfetched joke about him being isolated from society such that he never learned about linux ;)
[22:45:02] <SpiceMan> no, there's lots of people like that in Japan. They know whatever small coding environment they taught them at work, and nothing else. 
[22:45:11] <SpiceMan> they are not computer hobbyists
[22:45:19] <buZz> i know, a lot of hermits too ;)
[22:46:14] <laidback_01> i unironically believe that ~90% of people in IT are incompetent  totally agree.  my hospital just hired a Network Admin... who when I asked, was unaware of the OSI model.  couldn't tell me what layer 7 was.
[22:46:59] <SpiceMan> in the 70s and 80s when electronics exploded with Japan being on the avant-garde.... they utterly lacked the man power for such explosion of work.
[22:47:16] <laidback_01> dude is barely at tech level - good at using the game station, was really proud of dual-booting windows/linux, but since it didn't do anything 'cool' he went back to playing games.
[22:47:40] <SpiceMan> so they basically made anyone program. lots of 50-60 year-olds story is "I was an accountant at X, they needed programmers and taught me on the run"
[22:47:46] <SpiceMan> or something
[22:48:24] <buZz> hehe, i've been in a company where all devs used to be DBAs 
[22:48:30] <buZz> their code was insane
[22:48:44] <buZz> 'but, THIS is how i would do it in foxpro!'
[22:49:01] <laidback_01> oh.  everyone is a DBA... because at the time that's the title that commanded the salary worth chasing
[22:49:22] <laidback_01> it's awesome having HR attach salary to title.
[22:49:26] <buZz> these were all early 90s DBAs 
[22:49:39] <buZz> from the days before requirement documents :P
[22:49:42] <SpiceMan> that's half the story. the other half is that they don't care about CS degrees in IT companies. they hire anyone from non-social sciences from good universities. good university -> supposedly smart
[22:50:03] <SpiceMan> so they hire some 20something years old that studied chemistry to code

[22:51:10] <ens> i want to compare two arrays to see if they are equivalent. currently i'm using if (@a ~~ @b) { } but perl is giving me warnings that smartmatch is experimental.
[22:51:13] <laidback_01> heh...  where I'm at, we have a very poor technical subset.  our local college will train the nurses, and that's good.  and they have a great diesel mech shop.  but IT/IS is... well go to another college, we don't do that here.
[22:51:34] <ens> is there a better way to do this?
