[00:01:49] <sarnold> it's common in some places to store the string "hello" with what's essentially a 5 followed by ascii for h, e, l, l, o
[00:02:20] <sarnold> the other common way is to store "hello" as the ascii for h, e, l, l, o, and then \x00  to terminate it
[00:02:27] <tuskkk____> aaaah
[00:02:33] <sarnold> there's pros and cons to both approaches
[00:03:29] <tuskkk____> wow, so this whole thing can simply be decoded using the ascii chart, just by identifying the pattern!
[00:03:47] <ms7821> well, the "label" parts of the query can be
[00:03:51] <sarnold> depending upon the problem you're solving, yeah
[00:04:00] <sarnold> but if it's actual dns off the wire, that will only get you so far
[00:04:36] <ms7821> https://serverfault.com/questions/173187/what-does-a-dns-request-look-like might be enlightening
[00:04:55] <sarnold> oh that's better than the rfcs, heh
[00:05:01] <tuskkk____> yeah, because apart from example.com there also should be an ip address in there
[00:05:40] <sarnold> .. especially because dns has a *lot* of RFCs https://powerdns.org/dns-camel/
[00:08:11] <ms7821> tuskkk____, yep, if you follow the order of the output from wireshark for the "response" (search for 8180) you should be able to match the parts up
[00:08:49] <tuskkk____> setting up wireshark as we speak
[00:09:06] <tuskkk____> I have heard about this tool, its finally time to play with this bad boy
[00:10:14] <ms7821> you can use wireshark's "import hex dump" feature to import your data
[00:15:46] <ms7821> alternatively, you can use tshark on the command line
[00:15:53] <ms7821> printf "\xa0\x1d\x81\x80\x00\x01\x00\x01\x00\x00\x00\x00\x07\x65\x78\x61\x6d\x70\x6c\x65\x03\x63\x6f\x6d\x00\x00\x01\x00\x01\xc0\x0c\x00\x01\x00\x01\x00\x00\x1b\xbc\x00\x04\x5d\xb8\xd8\x22"|od -Ax -tx1|text2pcap -q -u 53,53 - -|tshark -r-
[00:17:04] <ms7821> (add -V on the end to get output like the serverfault answer)
[00:23:07] <tuskkk____> ok, yeah, working through all of it slowly
