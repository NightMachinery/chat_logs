[00:24:14] <Codaraxis> When I C-l on a headline to grab it as a link, is it possible to a) have it generate an ID if one doesn't already exist; and b) Set the link itself to the ID while keeping the link text?
[00:24:50] <Codaraxis> Er, C-c l
[00:25:29] <Codaraxis> So, I guess slightly modifying the behaviour of org-store-link
[00:25:33] *** Quits: johnny_sitar (~artur@078088015209.bialystok.vectranet.pl) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[00:26:21] <BerntH> Codaraxis: yes
[00:26:53] <BerntH> when I generate a link it stores a properly for the generated id and the link uses the id when I insert it with the name of the headline as the text
[00:27:48] <BerntH> I have the variable org-id-method set to 'uuidgen
[00:29:17] <Codaraxis> Hm. Looks like org-id-method is set to just "uuid" for me. Not sure if that would affect things, but the rest of the behaviour is exactly what's desired
[00:29:26] <Codaraxis> What did you have to set to get that behaviour?
[00:29:42] <Codaraxis> BerntH, 
[00:32:11] <NotThatRPG> Is it possible to put a hyperlink *inside* a source block?
[00:32:17] <BerntH> This is what I get: https://paste.chapril.org/?8c2cdf2436a47b2f#5KvVaVSjWkypajWQ55hnrgVXRMFqJe167uwJL2UjhPqR
[00:34:28] <Codaraxis> BerntH, Aye. That's exactly what I'm looking for. How did you get the behaviour though? Is it just an option that I need to set in my dotfile?
[00:34:44] <BerntH> NotThatRPG: it is just text - it'll look like raw stuff and not behave like a hyperlink which probably isn't what you want
[00:36:40] <BerntH> http://doc.norang.ca/org-mode.html#LinkingToTaskCreatesId
[00:38:11] <NotThatRPG> BerntH: Yes, I was afraid of that. What I was looking for was the ability to put hyperlinks in comments in a source block to point out to text for literate programming
[00:39:17] <BerntH> I don't know how/if you can achieve what you want there
[00:40:16] <BerntH> I'm sure it's possible -- anything is possible in Emacs pretty much :)
[00:40:33] <BerntH> but you may have to add functions to your mode to deal with it and I have no idea how you do that
[00:42:12] <Codaraxis> BerntH, Awesome! Works like a charm.
[00:43:21] <BerntH> Codaraxis: great! :)
[00:43:23] <Codaraxis> I'm not familiar with Norang. Looking at it, I'm interpreting it as this person's guide to Org mode features and how they use it. That accurate?
[00:43:24] <NotThatRPG> BerntH: Probably it would be possible to persuade the processing of source code to allow it to interpret links, but probably I won't bother. Clearly I've reached the point of being more interested in hacking my environment than actually writing htis document.
[00:43:31] <BerntH> I forgot how I did that - had to look it up
[00:43:37] <asus> BerntH, > you just do regular C-c C-s multiple times to reschedule
[00:43:41] <BerntH> in that document I wrote 10+ years ago
[00:44:01] <asus> I know but it doesn't write out "REscheduled from ... on ... like in your example ><"
[00:44:04] <Codaraxis> Oh! Haha, you wrote it.
[00:44:05] <BerntH> asus: it's just a regular schedule action
[00:44:27] <Codaraxis> Well, it looks good. I'll have to read it to see what else I can learn
[00:44:49] <BerntH> Codaraxis: yes it's on an ancient version of org-mode and I stopped updating it on...July 23 2015
[00:45:19] <Codaraxis> Ah. I'll keep that in mind
[00:45:36] <BerntH> I am using similar stuff on a recent org mode version so most of it should still be good
[00:46:54] <BerntH> asus: did you set org-log-reschedule ?  
[00:47:25] <BerntH> I haven't updated org in awhile - I'm on verson 9.4.5

[01:11:55] <asus> BerntH, excuse me sometimes I'm dumb, now I saved the modified spacemacs dotfiles and it works
[01:11:59] <asus> look https://imgur.com/a/085MUPc
[01:12:19] <asus> but as you can see, the "reschdule" effectively _moves_ the appt
[01:12:34] <asus> so it only appears once in the agenda
[01:12:40] <BerntH> yes it does - the appointment only has 1 effective time (the current scheduled time)
[01:12:47] <asus> yup
[01:13:00] <BerntH> and the details of when it used to be are in the rescheduled lines in the log
[01:13:23] <asus> but my visit to the dentist say in 2021, and my visit in 2022, are twi _different_ events you know ?
[01:13:24] <BerntH> alternatively you can keep separate tasks per appointment - or change your active TS to inactive when you move it
[01:13:35] <BerntH> then why are they one headline?
[01:13:53] <asus> in order to avoid writing the same thing
[01:14:09] <BerntH> for me every appointment is a separate headline with notes normally - except for some recurring tasks that automatically move when I mark them done
[01:14:15] <BerntH> you can clone it
[01:15:09] <BerntH> there is a function to clone the headline to a new one (C-c C-x c)
[01:15:23] <asus> Oh, I may have misunderstood the whole purpose of headlines...
[01:15:30] <BerntH> and it optionally rewrites your timestamps
[01:15:57] <asus> I'll reflect upon it and come back to you with an example of how I see things VS how you see them
[01:16:36] <asus> (thanks for the tip!)
[01:17:12] <BerntH> I normally create new tasks (headlines) for appointments, meetings, etc
[01:17:20] <BerntH> only a few of them repeat at regular intervals
[01:17:38] <BerntH> the reminder task to book the appointment makes sense to have repeating
[01:17:59] <BerntH> you mark it done and moves out to the next interval
[01:18:01] <tyson2> I set repeating appointments for regular meetings.  Everything else gets a new headline
[01:18:24] <tyson2> I also use habits for things that need to be done regularly
[01:19:19] <tyson2> I also have repeating appointments for one or two tasks done every day
[01:19:58] <tyson2> will soon switch those to weekdays only (using the special date expression)

[16:26:30] <Codaraxis_> Demosthenex, I can't comment on the craze as I haven't tried it yet, but I have heard about it on and off for a couple years and have wanted to give it a try
[16:27:10] <Codaraxis_> Having a network of visualizable, interconnected atomic information is something I've considered and wanted for a long while
[16:28:22] <Codaraxis_> Having multiple paths to get to the same piece of information is particulrly interesting. Despite using Org, I have a little disdain for how ubiquitous strictly, linearly hierarchical tree structures are. They're easy to implement, but I've always found them constricting
[16:31:57] <Demosthenex> Codaraxis_: you haven't tried hyperlinking org notes? that's native.
[16:32:22] <Demosthenex> i don't like the idea of "one item per file" and i don't like needing external tools like sql just to add backlinks.
[16:32:32] <Demosthenex> i agree, hyperlinked notes are a great idea
[16:32:57] <Demosthenex> a guy in the 1800's resorting to index cards, numbering systems, and tiny notes to make hyperlinks is good for the tech of that time

[16:33:17] <Demosthenex> but we can natively have hyperlinks in our org notes, organized in outlines, with links that span files and hierarchy
[16:33:37] <Demosthenex> i only ask why i should imitate a paper system when i already have something better
[16:34:23] <konubinix> Demosthenex: I also am astonished of how many people start using org-mode (and emacs) in order to use org-roam
[16:34:37] *** Joins: koffeinfriedhof (~koffeinfr@ubuntuusers/moderation/koffeinfriedhof)
[16:35:07] <konubinix> The only reason I can think of why people do that is because there are no suitable alternative
[16:35:35] <Codaraxis_> That's a legitimate question. I do hyperlink my notes, however, I'd like to experiment with different visualization, navigation, and note-linking methods
[16:36:37] <konubinix> And then people start with "noob starter pack" like doom or spacemacs and eventually learn emacs the hard way (in my humble opinion)
[16:36:38] <Demosthenex> Codaraxis_: if you're already adept at org, by all means try roam.
[16:36:56] <Demosthenex> yeah, i'm a bottom up guy. learn the layers.
[16:37:07] <Codaraxis_> I've just been using Org mode on its own for the last couple years and haven't taken the plunge into Org roam territory yet. Stock, it's more versatile than any other note-taking or organization system I've tried
[16:37:21] <konubinix> I mean that the more layers of abstractions there are, the harder it is to learn the bottom layer
[16:37:25] <Demosthenex> then you're  aperfect candidate to try out roam =]
[16:37:48] <Demosthenex> i've learned the hard way over the years to apply the least technology required to perform the task at hand.
[16:37:52] <konubinix> Codaraxis_: I've been using vanilla org since 
[16:37:55] <konubinix> 2010
[16:37:56] <Demosthenex> so, webapps can sod right off

[16:38:11] <Codaraxis_> konubinix, ha, I'm actually guilty of that one. I'm running Spacemacs. I tried configuring Emacs from scratch a couple times, but found I never had the time to get it to a state I considered usable, so would drop it whenever real work landed on my plate
[16:38:11] <konubinix> And tried org-roam almost 2 years ago
[16:38:35] <konubinix> Codaraxis_: I cannot imagine my life without roam now ;-) 
[16:38:37] <Demosthenex> Codaraxis_: no problem there. many of us had "starter pack" configs
[16:38:51] <tyson2> roam and org-roam seem like a bridge too far for me
[16:38:57] <Demosthenex> konubinix: so what's the killer feature that roam provides for you? over org?
[16:39:47] <tyson2> I find that search is fine for most things (I also use ripgrep to assist with that)
[16:39:53] <konubinix> My comment abput "starter pack" might have sounded pretentious but it was not the intent

[16:40:20] <konubinix> Demosthenex: I don't think in term pf features
[16:40:48] <konubinix> And I don't try to rationalize much about those things
[16:41:10] <konubinix> When I try to do this, my arguments look like confluence is the perfect tool to me
[16:41:11] *** Joins: sangoma (~kabaka@41.190.135.117)
[16:41:29] <konubinix> Yet I feel definitely better in org/org-roam rather than confluence
[16:41:53] <konubinix> Then, I decided that I cannot tell why, but I definitely love my org-roam setup 
[16:42:08] <konubinix> And by all means, there is no perfect setup for anyone
[16:42:16] <konubinix> *everyone
[16:42:51] <konubinix> So I assume that your grep setup is likely awesome for you, the way my setup is awesome to me
[16:43:03] <BerntH> Use what works for you :)
[16:43:31] <konubinix> This is one of the awesomeness of emacs: you can create your own tool on top of it
[16:43:31] <Demosthenex> i think that's the key. backlinks are the core feature i think roam provides, but i can use grep and emacs search tools without installing new things
[16:43:57] <Demosthenex> emacs is putty, you make what you want of it
[16:44:05] <konubinix> I barely notice I am using emacs/org/org-roam anymore. It has become an extension of me.
[16:44:29] <Demosthenex> exactly. when someone asks me org keybinds, i have to stop and watch my hands ;]
[16:44:33] <tyson2> It's like google vs. yahoo
[16:44:44] <konubinix> Demosthenex: Same here :-D
[16:45:23] <tyson2> or SQL vs. older styles of databases with lots of links between different things.
[16:45:25] <Codaraxis_> Demosthenex, I can't comment on the efficacy but I can say that how something is organized, by default, can influence how one thinks about the content. This is part of why I want to give it a try. Grepping and jumping across files will still be an option
[16:45:43] <konubinix> Demosthenex: You may think of org-roam as any other package
[16:45:58] <konubinix> Demosthenex: Do you use some emacs packages?
[16:46:19] <konubinix> Like flycheck ?
[16:46:33] <tyson2> SQL mostly won, and the full text search approach won out over hierarchies and complex links between entities
[16:46:45] <konubinix> Well, of course ypu dp, ypu use org-mode
[16:47:28] <konubinix> Demosthenex: Ahh ok, you don't like the idea of using a cache?
[16:47:55] <konubinix> Well, IIUC, org-mode also keeps a cache of some stuffs
[16:48:09] <konubinix> Like .org-id-locations
[16:48:50] <konubinix> Why is it ok for your that org-mode keeps .org-id-locations and not that org-roam keeps org-roam.db?
[16:48:57] <konubinix> Because ot is sqlite?
[16:49:09] <konubinix> *it
[16:49:10] <tyson2> the use of caching is increasing in org, according to the list
[16:49:58] <Codaraxis_> That does seem to be one of the biggest criticisms I've heard of Org-roam: the move away from plain text content.
[16:50:04] <konubinix> Demosthenex: I think that when people say nice thçngs about org-roam, they are more discussing about the UX rather than the cachçng system
[16:51:17] <konubinix> Demosthenex: I think that if your provide a  implementation of the UX of org-roam based on grep instead of sql, people would think of it as a suitable alternative
[16:51:48] <konubinix> To my mind, people using org-roam don't care whether there is a sqlite engine behind the scene
[16:52:06] <konubinix> Like they likely don't care that flycheck uses ispell behind the scene
[16:53:40] <konubinix> Codaraxis_: To me, if at some point the plain text is no more the single source of truth, org-roam would loose a lot of usrrs
[16:54:27] <konubinix> Fortunately, its authors appear to have an emacs state of mind and keep the org files as the single spurce of truth
[16:59:01] <Codaraxis_> Agreed
[17:04:53] <Demosthenex> i don't care about the cache, i'm just immediately going to question adding tons of new layers 
[17:05:41] <tyson2> Demosthenex: agree, my strong preference is for simplicity, not complexity
[17:05:45] <Demosthenex> i hear emacs-dev is looking at adding sqlite to core. that'd be cool

[17:53:05] <Codaraxis_> Is it possible to schedule todo state changes? It's a desire that's come up a few times. For example, I have a credit card payment due on the 20th. However, the billing cycle doesn't roll over until the 1st. So, while it's recurring, it shouldn't become TODO until then
[17:54:24] <Codaraxis_> At the moment, I use Org edna with a monthly scheduled child task. When it's triggered, it schedules itself for the next 1st of the month, sets itself to TODO, sets its associated ancestor to TODO, and sets its schedule as appropriate.
[17:55:32] <Codaraxis_> However, it'd be nice to automate this a bit more since, right now, the child task is basically a manually executed cronjob

[20:07:51] <konubinix> Demosthenex: If this is what disturbs you. I don't understand why it makes you dislike org-roam
[20:08:30] <konubinix> To me, there are quite few layers and responsibilities are well separated
[20:08:45] <konubinix> fundamental -> outline -> org -> roam
[20:09:27] <konubinix> If you'd like to see roam's UX directly in org, you would just bloat org with features that not everyone wants, right?
[20:09:58] <konubinix> And when you describe that you can do the same thing of roam in org, you describe a new layer as well
[20:10:15] <konubinix> Based on grep rather than sqlite, but a new layer anyway
[20:11:09] <konubinix> Then, I don't understand why you'd criticize org-roam with the argument of the number of layers while you would not do ptherwise as addind a layer to provide the same UX
[20:12:00] <konubinix> Or do you criticize the hype of starting with doom? But that (to me) is independant
