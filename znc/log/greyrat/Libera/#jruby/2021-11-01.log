[15:06:03] <edipofederle[m]> Morning, 
[15:06:03] <edipofederle[m]> headius  I just see your comment here https://github.com/jruby/jruby/issues/6869#issuecomment-942650187 now. By what I see we still dont have  9.4 branched, right?
[17:17:36] <enebo[m]> edipo.federle: it will be on master until it has bee released
[17:19:09] <edipofederle[m]> enebo: makes sense, so in order to include it on the docker image ( issue I previous post here) I need to use master as 'target' ?
[17:20:07] <enebo[m]> edipo.federle: if you need a branch name yeah
[17:20:34] <enebo[m]> At some point it will end up on jruby-9.4 but we generally do not make that until after at least a few point releases
[17:20:57] <edipofederle[m]> right,thanks!
[19:57:39] <edipofederle[m]> Question this is the behavior on MRI, but since I'm redefining the class, should we continue with only 2 instance variable ?... (full message at https://libera.ems.host/_matrix/media/r0/download/libera.chat/332e4a9a2013e12245b2fb48df334ddf682d37e3)
[19:58:48] <headius> You don't really redefine classes in Ruby, you just reopen them
[19:59:06] <edipofederle[m]> Arg! this is true :)
[19:59:17] <headius> So this is still the same Class object and it still has the @y from before
[19:59:17] <edipofederle[m]> my bad lol
[19:59:44] <edipofederle[m]> yep, for sure.
[20:00:39] <edipofederle[m]> btw, I'm taking a look at this https://github.com/jruby/jruby/issues/153, your last comment if from 2017, but still present in current version, is something to be considered relevant yet?
