[17:21:01] <rawtaz> we have been wondering too
[17:21:04] <Andecy> I'm currently working on both GCP and AWS building complex infrastructure, and this context switching is wrecking me.. I was wondering if I am alone in that or it's common, additionally is there any way to ease the strain?
[17:21:59] <Andecy> I think I'm going abit cuckoo here in the past few weeks
[17:22:12] <rawtaz> i really cannot say but i would highly expect that everyone is suffering from the same thing. perhaps not in the sense that they like suffer from it mentally, its a matter of "just" learning both, but having to dabble with the same type of thing in two totally different environments of course sucks :(
[17:22:39] <rawtaz> do you feel you're losing grip of what you need to write in terms of IaC etc or what is the actual practical problem?
[17:22:57] <rawtaz> perhaps all you need to do is spend more time reading reddit's "interestingasfuck" subreddit :)
[17:23:05] <shad> man, i have a bit of OVH and AWS. OVH gives me headaches anytime i get near it
[17:23:09] <Andecy> Did you find success in implementing solutions in two clouds simultaniously?
[17:23:26] <Andecy> heheh
[17:23:30] <rawtaz> i havent done any of that sorry. but im sure that if you stay a bit youll find people here that does it
[17:24:04] <shad> Andecy: by both cloud, you use both of their integrated solutions, eg: Google Cloud Run on one side and Fargate on the other 
[17:24:06] <shad> ?

[17:26:12] <Andecy> If it was only AWS I would probably have 3x the throughput

[17:28:03] <Andecy> Im DevOps-as-a-service
[17:29:05] <dodo> what's your bottleneck exactly?
[17:29:09] <shad> oh, so you deploy at different places for different clients then
[17:29:32] <Andecy> I think its mental
[17:29:35] <Andecy> Context switching
[17:29:38] <dodo> oh
[17:29:44] <dodo> double fee, problem solved :)
[17:30:19] <Andecy> rawtaz: I'm feeling more like r/cursedimages at this stage hehe
[17:30:49] <Andecy> Yeah but I fear I will not survive accepting so much
[17:30:57] <dodo> i'm serious though, too much work -> higher fee -> less work -> same or more money
[17:31:45] <Andecy> I actually found that the more I get payed to less work I have.. maybe I do need to ask for a raise
[17:32:15] <shad> Andecy: are you freelance ? Maybe take less gigs at the same time
[17:32:24] <Andecy> I'm not freelance
[17:32:35] <shad> It sounds more like burnout than actual technical difficulties
[17:32:41] <dodo> yeah
[17:33:00] <dodo> sorry, i misread that then. go to your manager and say you need more people?
[17:33:09] <Andecy> shad: you are probably right

[17:36:52] <merpaderp> is it usual practice to encrypt traffic between frontend and backend with tls?
[17:36:56] <merpaderp> nginx to nginx communication
[17:37:12] <merpaderp> when both servers are practically nearby, two VMs in a tight sack
[17:37:30] <shad> merpaderp: it is absolutely mandatory to encrypt traffic between client and backend
[17:37:45] <merpaderp> like, absolutely?
[17:37:51] <shad> your frontend javascript client is executed in your clients browser
[17:37:58] <shad> even though it is served by nginx
[17:40:00] *** Quits: BrunoFontes (~bruno@179.178.208.231) (Quit: WeeChat 3.4)
[17:40:36] <shad> what isn't always mandatory is an encrypted connection between your loadbalancer, proxy, and your backend, if it's running on the same host
[17:41:14] <shad> eg: your client laptop -> nginx -> your REST API
[17:41:25] <shad> between client and nginx -> HTTPS mandatory
[17:41:44] <shad> between nginx and the api -> eh. Don't want to decrypt TLS yourself usually
[17:42:09] <merpaderp> so in devops terms, frontend is the code executed in browser, eh
[17:42:36] <shad> with some exceptions, such as Server Side Rendering, but i'm not that experienced in that field
[17:43:01] <merpaderp> well anyways I meant that between my front nginx server and backend nginx server which then forwards to locally running django app
[17:43:51] <shad> you have something like a sites-enabled/api.conf file with "location / { proxy_pass localhost:<some_port> }" right ?
[17:44:55] *** Joins: dme86 (~dan@user/dan86)
[17:45:29] <merpaderp> yeap
[17:45:40] <merpaderp> location / and two more for static media
[17:45:55] <merpaderp> it just seems to me that it could be simplified a bit
[17:46:09] <shad> what's your frontend like ? you said nginx server, did you mean site-enabled ?
[17:48:55] <merpaderp> do we mean frontend as a server with nginx and SSL cert, forwarding to backend, right?
[17:49:25] <shad> negative
[17:49:36] <merpaderp> do we mean js in clients browser?
[17:49:47] <shad> server is a word that should be removed from the language, it means everything, anything
[17:49:57] <merpaderp> oh well, VM then?
[17:50:39] <shad> front-end means an application used by a client, be it a website or anything else, that consume content provided by an API (usually named backend)
[17:51:10] <shad> Nginx is an HTTP Server, bound to port 80 and 4443
[17:51:13] <shad> 443*
[17:51:23] <merpaderp> okay, so I guess correct term is load balancer
[17:51:35] <merpaderp> doesnt matter that it balances to single backend
[17:52:06] <shad> if you use nginx to forward traffic to your application running on the same node, it is said to be a reverse proxy
[17:53:18] <shad> And so, having communication from internet to your nginx reverse proxy over HTTPS is 100% mandatory, having communication between nginx proxy and your application over HTTPS is probably overkill and not needed

[23:12:44] <fschuindt> What are the open source solutions (self hosted) for DDoS mitigation on non-http TCP based applications? It's a gaming service.
[23:13:14] <slaughter> Route it all to /dev/null
[23:14:54] <rawtaz> most DDoS has to do with resource exhaustion and that generally means being able to cope with tons of traffic. how do you intend to "self host" that?

[23:18:54] <fschuindt> I was thinking in having a set of small reverse proxy servers, like half a dozen distributed in different parts of the globe. The client application would choose one of those proxies to connect and this proxy would make the connection to the application. The real application IP would be only accessed by those proxies. But the problem is that if it will simply route the traffic to server without any
[23:18:56] <fschuindt> analysis, the server would simply take the DDoS too, 'cause the DDoS would be also proxied. I'm wondering if there's a known application to run as those reverse proxies but I might be just dreaming nonsense. I'm not sure.
[23:19:38] <rawtaz> Andecy: can you like do it like this: one week (or one day) you only do AWS, next week (or day) you only do Azure, and so on. or two days each, or whatever.
[23:19:43] <rawtaz> reduce context switching.

[23:27:13] <rawtaz> fschuindt: i really cant say but IMO DDoS protection is something thats done at the pipe level, by your internet provider
[23:28:19] <rawtaz> but i guess it depends on what you are trying to defend against. you probably need to establish a definition so you knwo what you ned to solve
[23:29:21] <kwilczynski> Defends against ninjas.
[23:29:25] <kwilczynski> TCP ninjas.
[23:29:28] <kwilczynski> :)
[23:31:35] <fschuindt> rawtaz: I'm hosting on AWS, and they do offer layer 3 and 4 built-in protection. My server is not public yet, I think I'll wait for the DDoS first to protect later. I don't like to solve problems I still don't have. But would be nice to start to think about it 'cause I know that if everything goes as planned, DDoS is more than expected.

[23:38:58] <slaughter> Sounds like you're willing to go super far out of your way to mitigate DDoS there with global server distribution etc...why not just use an out of the box solution?
[23:39:04] *** Joins: dme86 (~dan@user/dan86)
[23:44:48] <kwilczynski> fschuindt: You really need to define what sort of DDoS you want to protect against. It's a broad spectrum.
[23:45:18] <kwilczynski> And you might be doing some premature optimization here. Given that nothing you have is public yet.
[23:46:20] <kwilczynski> Also, being afraid of any sort of denial attack makes me think that something  is up with your design.

[23:47:28] <kwilczynski> It's like being Boeing releasing 737 MAX - it might fall down, we know it, people might die, sure thing. Better to get a team of layers ready.
