[14:46:33] <re101-pug-69> can you please help me?
[14:46:53] <JohnDoe2> re101-pug-69 with what, exactly?

[14:47:17] <re101-pug-69> so as you can see there are 3 lines where ~~~~~ ignored
[14:47:36] <re101-pug-69> i want to include ~~~~s to the 3rd capture group
[14:47:50] <re101-pug-69> but it is normally excluded because of the search pattern ^\~
[14:48:06] <JohnDoe2> you're talking about line 17?
[14:48:11] <JohnDoe2> what about line 18?
[14:48:27] <re101-pug-69> yes
[14:48:28] <re101-pug-69> and 18
[14:48:56] <re101-pug-69> ok so the desired pattern would be: firs character ^ or ~
[14:49:06] <re101-pug-69> second group is two letter
[14:49:19] <re101-pug-69> third group is anyting expext the first two
[14:49:27] <re101-pug-69> except
[14:49:48] <JohnDoe2> first two meaning ^ and ~ or ^/~ and whatever group 1 captured?
[14:49:55] <re101-pug-69> my actual pattern obviously not include repeating ~s

[14:50:26] <re101-pug-69> I mean same pattern but not tha actual captured
[14:50:46] <JohnDoe2> alright that didn't elucidate it for me
[14:51:46] <JohnDoe2> let's look at line 18: you want to match ~ but are excluding any ^ or ~ characters -- what's the logic? trying to get to the next block?
[14:52:52] <JohnDoe2> and why do you need the /s flag?
[14:52:53] <re101-pug-69> so what i search is patterns which has the following format:       for example ~AB.......something......     or      ^AB....something......
[14:53:32] <re101-pug-69> i want to include new line characters
[14:54:05] <JohnDoe2> meaning your ^AB blocks can go across lines?
[14:54:07] <re101-pug-69> ......something...... can be repeating ~~~~~~ or ^^^^^^ as welll :)
[14:54:26] <JohnDoe2> then you don't want [^^~] ?
[14:54:27] <re101-pug-69> YES ^AB blocks can go across lines
[14:54:58] <re101-pug-69> yes [^^~] is not a good solution 
[14:55:11] <re101-pug-69> but it was good form me as long I needed repeating ~~~
[14:55:13] <re101-pug-69> :)
[14:55:32] <JohnDoe2> that's the opposite, it won't match any ^ or ~
[14:55:32] <re101-pug-69> what would be the solution ?
[14:56:17] <re101-pug-69> that was my way of solving greedy *
[14:56:39] <re101-pug-69> it will eat every other character excel ~ or ^
[14:57:01] <re101-pug-69> but in the mean time I required ~ as well ... :S

[20:46:50] <lonefox> Always wanted to learn regex in detail and want to build it myself. Also, for this instance considering my timelines would be glad if I can have the regex given to me.
[20:47:20] <yitz> lonefox: Look at the outer ()s. See how the regex is broken into two parts?
[20:47:43] <lonefox> yes
[20:48:14] <yitz> lonefox: See how the first part matches until a :// ?
[20:48:27] <lonefox> yes and the second one is matching until /
[20:48:48] <yitz> Right! So the first part catches http and https
[20:49:01] <yitz> If you want the second part to go until the end vs until a / ... just change the second part
[20:49:09] <yitz> .* would match "everything" 
[20:49:19] <lonefox> I think 
[20:49:36] <lonefox> 1. The first part should match www as well (if it exists)
[20:49:53] <yitz> One change at a time :D
[20:49:53] <lonefox> 2. second part should simply match everything after that
[20:49:59] <lonefox> :D  for sure
[20:50:05] <int> understood. Thanks
[20:50:24] <yitz> lonefox: the above should address your 2.
[20:50:38] <lonefox> that works!! yayy https://regex101.com/r/tYzyzd/7
[20:50:48] <yitz> For matching a www piece, you'd want to add an optional (?) piece in between. 
[20:51:01] <yitz> (foo)?  matches an optional "foo"
[20:51:48] <yitz> So you can match an (optional) www\.  between the two parts
[20:52:10] <lonefox> that worked but looks like now it is matching only www https://regex101.com/r/tYzyzd/8
[20:52:33] <yitz> It's matching both. You have two capturing groups
[20:53:02] <yitz> If you put in that match   ?:   at the start of the www group, though, it makes it a non-capturing group. Just like the http piece
[20:53:08] <yitz> *that magic  ?:

[20:57:15] <lonefox> I thought it should match the exact string. I guess . is being interpreted as a special meaning here

[20:58:58] <lonefox> thank you once again.
[20:59:37] <lonefox> Before I led you go.. would you be able to route me to regex resources where I can learn things from basics?
[21:01:13] <lonefox> oh.. I have another use case.. if there's no http:// and simple example.com I want to match this as well.. so the whole matching should be optional
[21:01:37] <lonefox> same goes with www.example.com => example.com
[21:02:06] <lonefox> https://regex101.com/r/tYzyzd/13
[21:03:55] <yitz> You combined the http piece and the www piece, if you look at the ()s
[21:04:14] <yitz> Just like you made the www optional, you can make the http optional
[21:04:36] <lonefox> so I need to split them as 3 parts
[21:04:47] <lonefox> and 1st and 2nd are optional

[21:05:15] <yitz> *Right
[21:05:48] <yitz> Three pieces:   ()()()     First two optional:   ()?()?()

[21:20:33] <lonefox> yitz looks like we have 2 groups in this regex denoted by blue and green. My code doesn't seem to recognize the green one. This is what I mean https://www.freeformatter.com/java-regex-tester.html#ad-output
[21:20:50] <lonefox> oops ignore the link
[21:21:44] <lonefox> https://regex101.com/r/tYzyzd/16 if we hover on blue part, it says match 1 and green part is group 1.
[21:24:20] <yitz> Yes. The entire line does match for match 1. The 3rd piece is in a () making it a capture group, i.e. group 1
[21:24:53] <yitz> You probably want to tell your code to look at group 1
[21:26:10] <lonefox> right... I just did that and it worked
