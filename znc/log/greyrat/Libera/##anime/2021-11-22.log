[00:00:03] <MootPoot> but at least they give enough of a crutch to know what the fuck it is
[00:00:08] <MootPoot> which is all I need
[00:01:31] <Cryowolf> "No! The man does what food the girl had! Don't is the touching. It is loud"
[00:01:50] <Cryowolf> I dunno if it always helps you know what the fuck it is
[00:01:55] <Cryowolf> but sometimes I guess :P
[00:01:59] <MootPoot> .....
[00:03:51] <Cryowolf> Im waiting for Worlds End Harem to continue in January
[00:04:06] <Cryowolf> it looks like a split personality show that doesnt know what it wants to be
[00:04:18] <Cryowolf> it thinks it should be a hentai but it stops at adult ecchi
[00:05:18] <MootPoot> continue?
[00:05:20] <MootPoot> I thought it ended
[00:05:30] <beaky> !a worlds end harem
[00:05:30] <ImoutoBot> beaky: I don't recognize that anime.
[00:05:36] <MootPoot> beaky: manga
[00:06:55] <Cryowolf> the first episode was released in October
[00:06:56] <Cryowolf> preview
[00:07:07] <Cryowolf> the whole anime will air in Jan 2022 and on
[00:07:11] <Cryowolf> winter cour
[00:08:13] <Aurora_v_kosmose> isekaijin: Not by any necessity nad I disagree with the abstractness making it intractable.
[00:12:30] <Cryowolf> I so need to find more  Mieruko-chan like animes

[00:31:00] <MootPoot> Cryowolf: magical girl site
[00:31:16] <MootPoot> the setting/story is different
[00:31:25] <MootPoot> but the art style and creepy shit is the same
[00:31:40] <Cryowolf>  uh not sure I want magical girl to be a part of it
[00:31:49] <MootPoot> yeah about that
[00:32:00] <MootPoot> its not that kind of cringe bright pink magical girl
[00:32:19] <MootPoot> Cryowolf: its like batman vs superman kind of difference, both are superheros
[00:32:26] <MootPoot> but batman is darker
[00:32:26] <MootPoot> etc
[00:33:36] <Cryowolf> the thing with Mieruko-Chan is that she has no idea how or what is happening since she's a regular girl (as far as she and atm the audience knows, with the exception she can see ghosts, spirits, demons etc)
[00:33:48] <Cryowolf> and the world is full of them, some really weird ones too
[00:33:53] <MootPoot> yeah there is like no anime quite like it 
[00:33:58] <MootPoot> that I know
[00:34:07] <MootPoot> there are some that are similar in some elements like magical girl site
[00:34:16] <Cryowolf> damn
[00:34:25] <Cryowolf> I have yet to watch Ghost Hound though
[00:34:25] <MootPoot> but they end up having a storyline where the MC learns about all the shit that's going on
[00:34:31] * MootPoot shrugs
[00:34:40] <Bco1981> feel like i remember something about a anime where they see ghost/monsters but they can't let them know they see them.
[00:34:50] <Bco1981> not Mieruko-Chan
[00:34:59] <Cryowolf> so the same thing but another one?
[00:35:15] <Bco1981> something like that
[00:35:18] <MootPoot> another related one - Shiki
[00:35:21] <MootPoot> i love that one
[00:35:29] <MootPoot> it does psych horror so well

[00:39:12] <Cryowolf> I watched one where its about a village in the middle of nowere with ancient vampires
[00:39:19] <Cryowolf> and some very few werewolves
[00:39:23] <MootPoot> that sounds like shiki
[00:39:42] <Cryowolf> towards a later point the MC gets very very sick
[00:39:46] <Cryowolf> from a scratch
[00:39:49] <MootPoot> yep
[00:39:56] <Cryowolf> and becomes a what now?
[00:40:08] <MootPoot> vamp or something
[00:40:13] <Cryowolf> werewolf :P
[00:40:17] <MootPoot> lol
[00:40:27] <Cryowolf> they were vampire guardians for thousands of years
[00:40:32] <MootPoot> if you like that kind of slow show
[00:40:36] <MootPoot> with psych  horror
[00:40:44] <MootPoot> you can try Monster
[00:40:52] <Cryowolf> is it supernatural?

[02:07:39] <Terminus> well, i've also come to the conclusion that it's better to just go straight to writing c++ rather than doing multiple rewrites from at least 2 other languages before finally ending up with c++.
[02:08:03] <MootPoot> I'm a degen who writes C#

[03:14:06] <MootPoot> amperes
[03:14:21] <MootPoot> you leave one wire in COM and one in the 10A socket right
[03:15:12] <Bco1981> don't you just point at the two spots where you want to messure between ?
[03:15:39] <Bco1981> ... do i even have one in my apartment...?
[03:15:54] <MootPoot> they  usually have 3 holes
[03:16:03] <MootPoot> 10A, VQm and COM
[03:16:20] <MootPoot> I ordered a 5V 8A PSU for my atomic PI
[03:16:24] <MootPoot> put multimeter in

[03:16:35] <MootPoot> first, its making 5.4v not 5
[03:16:38] <MootPoot> second
[03:16:49] <Bco1981> yea, com and amper
[03:16:57] <MootPoot> when I try to measure amps in amp mode
[03:16:58] <Bco1981> ampere*
[03:17:03] <MootPoot> the power adapter keeps tripping
[03:17:08] <MootPoot> and turning itself back on
[03:17:14] <MootPoot> and off
[03:17:24] <MootPoot> highest reading on the multimeter is 3.81A
[03:17:31] <MootPoot> but that jumps from like 0 to that 
[03:17:35] <MootPoot> and it trips
[03:17:40] <MootPoot> back to 0, then retries
[03:17:52] <MootPoot> not sure what's borked
[03:17:55] <MootPoot> PSU or meter
[03:17:58] <Bco1981> sounds like the adaptor can't do more

[03:18:12] <MootPoot> Bco1981: I got ripped off then I guess
[03:18:21] <MootPoot> this is supposed to be a 5v8A one
[03:18:28] <MootPoot> and it cant even cross  4
[03:18:28] <Bco1981> wow

[03:26:04] <Bco1981> usually it can messure up to 10A

[03:26:35] <MootPoot> thats just a theory

[03:45:01] <MootPoot> the pi dosen't take more then 4
[03:45:15] <MootPoot> so maybe psu-> 2 of these in paralell -> pi
[03:45:24] <MootPoot> I dont know how stupid of an idea that is
[03:46:05] <Bco1981> don't know, i have never done that with adaptors/psu's
[03:46:19] <MootPoot> yeah I'd want to doublecheck with someone who has dones this more then me

[03:55:50] <MootPoot> I was making a file name translator

[03:58:04] <MootPoot> wait
[03:58:08] <MootPoot> I'm just retarded
[03:58:14] <MootPoot> this is a step down only buck converter
[03:58:16] <MootPoot> nvm
[03:58:20] <amigojapan> MootPoot: I spent like 6 months with my pic broken cause I was lazy to fix it
[03:58:22] <MootPoot> one less thing that's broke
[03:59:27] <MootPoot> my chinese power supply for the atomic pi is producing too much voltage for its rating
[03:59:30] <MootPoot> it says 5v
[03:59:33] <MootPoot> but its doing 5.4
[03:59:43] <MootPoot> most things wont care but that will kill a computer
[04:00:10] <MootPoot> so my plan is to hook up two step down buck converters
[04:00:18] <MootPoot> to tone it down to exactly 5
[04:02:05] <amigojapan> Ok. I need to go now. Will still do IRC but a bit distracted now

[04:50:38] <Matt|home> tcsilver : ham radio
[04:50:50] <tcsilver> ah :) ham radio!
[04:51:24] <tcsilver> amazing
[04:51:29] <tcsilver> pretty cool.
[04:51:35] <tcsilver> how old are you matt ?
[04:51:43] <tcsilver> maybe you have a long time ahead with ham radio
[04:51:47] <tcsilver> that would be cool
[04:51:53] <ButterNoodle> Matt|home: what u gonna do u ur baofeng
[04:52:23] <Matt|home> 32 , just getting into ham now as a side hobby. step 1 ButterNoodle : learn to use it. this shit's more complicated than chinese algebra
[04:52:37] <ButterNoodle> download chirp to program it
[04:52:42] <ButterNoodle> u got license?
[04:52:47] * MootPoot chirps
[04:52:56] <tcsilver> I want a barameter and a radio
[04:53:04] <ButterNoodle> chirp is the swiss army knife of programming amateur radios
[04:53:10] <ButterNoodle> even business band
[04:53:11] <tcsilver> is it really complicated actually ?
[04:53:15] <ButterNoodle> yea
[04:53:17] <tcsilver> wow i didn't know
[04:53:24] <Matt|home> not yet. and yeah i need a programming cable but im just using this to listen for the time being, i don't have my license yet
[04:53:38] <tcsilver> I had only heard of ham radio. I used to want one
[04:53:55] <ButterNoodle> Matt|home: u in usa?
[04:54:00] <Matt|home> south florida ya
[04:54:04] <ButterNoodle> nice
[04:54:14] <amigojapan> tcsilver: it's a radio made out of ham :)
[04:54:14] <tcsilver> do you need a liscence to legally listen ?
[04:54:18] <Matt|home> tcsilver : if you study everything but the most complicated test is fairly easy. and it's essentially free
[04:54:18] <ButterNoodle> I talk to people in florida a lot.. plenty of hams there
[04:54:21] <Matt|home> nope, just to transmit
[04:54:21] <ButterNoodle> tcsilver: no
[04:54:21] <tcsilver> lo
[04:54:27] <tcsilver> lol
[04:54:29] <tcsilver> oh cool
[04:54:36] <ButterNoodle> hurricane net is fun to listen to
[04:54:50] <ButterNoodle> especially during active seasons
[04:55:01] <Matt|home> im like, 80% confident i can't pick anything up indoors since im in a _very_ concrete residential area, but we'll see
[04:55:20] <ButterNoodle> you'd be surprised
[04:55:41] <ButterNoodle> I can pickup a repeater about 20 miles away in my basement with a diamond nub
[04:56:03] <ButterNoodle> I think its the triband one.. which is even shittier
[04:56:17] <ButterNoodle> I have it on my thf6a
[04:56:23] <tcsilver> when I was a kid my dad had a CB radio
[04:56:33] <tcsilver> we had one till i was about 29
[04:56:38] <ButterNoodle> cb is fun when ur bored on the interstate
[04:56:43] <tcsilver> we might still have it somewhere
[04:56:45] <tcsilver> yeah
[04:56:46] <ButterNoodle> you can piss of people and trash talk
[04:57:23] <ButterNoodle> Matt|home: lookup up some good repeaters in ur area on radio reference.. bet u can receive indoors, maybe a bit scratchy
[04:57:38] <ButterNoodle> that reminds me.. MootPoot did the moose eat all the ham's in ur town?
[04:57:42] <tcsilver> I talked to a trucker over it as a kid about age 4 :---D
[04:57:58] <tcsilver> I said something like "breaker breaker 1-9"
[04:58:03] <ButterNoodle> or did u ever find an active repeater
[04:58:05] <tcsilver> and he responded
[04:58:22] <ButterNoodle> Matt|home get ur general.. get on hf
[04:58:37] <ButterNoodle> all the local repeaters are pretty depressing and disappointing
[04:58:45] <Matt|home> i will, but right now school is taking up 99.99% of my time
[04:59:00] <ButterNoodle> u studying something technical
[04:59:31] <ButterNoodle> u could learn enough to pass the tech and general over winter break
[04:59:38] <Matt|home> foreign language and then 4 classes next semester, but yes that's the plan
[04:59:46] <Matt|home> there's a local place close to here that does ham tests too
[05:00:01] <ButterNoodle> yea I'm an examiner
[05:00:08] <ButterNoodle> use to do it years ago
[05:00:15] <ButterNoodle> arrl and acars certified
[05:00:50] <ButterNoodle> then if u want the extra band privs study for the extra over summer break.. its a bit much to learn in a few weeks
[05:00:51] <tcsilver> what makes it so complicated ?
[05:01:05] <ButterNoodle> tcsilver: RF theory
[05:01:14] <tcsilver> oh
[05:01:20] <ButterNoodle> if ur an EE you can pass it in ur sleep
[05:01:22] <tcsilver> Radio Frequency details
[05:01:28] <ButterNoodle> no
[05:01:46] <ButterNoodle> electronics details.. stuff a radio/electronics engineer would study
[05:02:01] <tcsilver> ooooh
[05:02:19] <ButterNoodle> if u know what a smith chart is.. you might pass it
[05:02:44] <MootPoot> IT WORKS
[05:02:51] <ButterNoodle> ur pp?
[05:02:53] <tcsilver> I have heard of smith charts.. but I don't at all know what they are :D
[05:03:00] <tcsilver> my dad used to talk about all that stuff
[05:03:02] <MootPoot> that too ButterNoodle  - 
[05:03:06] <ButterNoodle> congrats
[05:03:13] <MootPoot> just finished a utility that translates file titles for me
[05:03:15] <MootPoot> in bulk
[05:03:37] <MootPoot> just so I know which doujin is the creampie one and which one is the pissing one
[05:04:04] <tcsilver> :D what did you code it in ? mootpoot
[05:04:14] <tcsilver> pootwhistle script!
[05:04:14] <MootPoot> I'm a degen
[05:04:21] <MootPoot> lol no scripting here
[05:04:23] <MootPoot> C#
[05:04:29] <tcsilver> ah :)
[05:04:42] <MootPoot> I dont like the tools for scripting
[05:04:53] <MootPoot> and running them is annoying
[05:05:01] <tcsilver> ya
[05:05:17] <MootPoot> although that being said my file handling code is shit
[05:05:21] <MootPoot> its not optimized at all
[05:05:24] <MootPoot> but it works
[05:05:37] <tcsilver> good
[05:06:13] <MootPoot> next up - figure out how to make youtube-DL download every file into its own folder
[05:06:37] <ButterNoodle> that sounds like something you wouldnt want to do
[05:06:52] <MootPoot> y
[05:07:11] <tcsilver> I think he means a folder for each media file
[05:07:15] <MootPoot> ^
[05:07:23] <MootPoot> every link gets its own file
[05:07:28] <MootPoot> folder*
[05:07:34] <tcsilver> yeah
[05:07:58] <tcsilver> that sounds fair mootpoot
[05:08:29] <MootPoot> the folder is named the URL of where it got it from , the file is inside with original name, and my script translates its name and makes a empty text file with the translated name as its title
[05:08:42] <MootPoot> ach- I said script - meant program
[05:09:13] <MootPoot> Actually wait that's kinda dumb 
[05:09:42] <MootPoot> Should have containing folder named the translation
[05:09:55] <MootPoot> I'll figure it out later

[10:26:15] <tcsilver> not profit :D
[10:26:19] <amigojapan> Lol
[10:26:27] <tcsilver> you not for sale! :D
[10:26:31] <tcsilver> says the association
[10:26:39] <tcsilver> do you like karate ?
[10:26:52] <tcsilver> you would be a good karate student for some people I think!
[10:27:01] <tcsilver> or judo
[10:27:03] <tcsilver> or kendo
[10:27:12] <amigojapan> tcsilver: I prophesize that I will sleep tonight :)
[10:27:22] <tcsilver> :D
[10:27:56] <amigojapan> tcsilver: I don't think I am really in condition to do martial arts
[10:27:58] <tcsilver> chi badaichi! . my spelling is more
[10:28:02] <tcsilver> poor*
[10:28:04] <tcsilver> not more
[10:28:13] <amigojapan> Maybe tai chi
[10:28:14] <tcsilver> ah
[10:28:36] <tcsilver> you could practice kata.
[10:28:44] <tcsilver> or taichi quan ya
[10:28:55] <amigojapan> Yeah
[10:29:09] <tcsilver> I want you to practice it :3 it's life enriching
[10:29:28] <tcsilver> which style of taichi would you perfer ? chen has somedyanamic karate like motions
[10:29:35] <tcsilver> and so does wu i think
[10:29:47] <amigojapan> For now I'm going to meditation lessons at a Buddhist temple
[10:29:48] <tcsilver> and yang has mostly all smooth motion in the forms
[10:29:57] <tcsilver> oooh.. you are advanced :D
[10:30:04] <tcsilver> I want to do that :3
[10:30:36] <amigojapan> Well. I have easy access to Buddhist temples, by living in Japan
[10:30:50] <tcsilver> but it's hard to find a temple in my region.. I went to the 2 local shaolin temple cultural centers run by real monks and they said to feel free to practice :D
[10:30:57] <tcsilver> wow
[10:31:34] <tcsilver> I wasn't fit at the time soooo... I chose just to study the meditation
[10:31:46] <tcsilver> but didn't get to study at the one with the real monk.. because of covid
[10:32:00] <tcsilver> but i got to study at one with people that were trained by monks in china
[10:32:04] <tcsilver> when I was a kid
[10:32:15] <tcsilver> they go there every summer for the whole summer
[10:32:21] <tcsilver> and all the students are invited
[10:32:31] <tcsilver> but tis' nto for fighting really that style
[10:32:37] <tcsilver> it's for self enhancement of other kinds
[10:32:43] <tcsilver> the style that they use 
[10:32:55] <tcsilver> it comes from nanjing and beinjing sports centers mostly
[10:33:09] <tcsilver> and some parts come from shaolin, judo and it has some tae kwon do and karate mixed in
[10:33:17] <tcsilver> that's because they run the areas top karate toruanments
[10:33:32] <tcsilver> also they have some other stuff mixed in like boxing and muay thai
[10:33:42] <tcsilver> and sanda elements
[10:33:52] <tcsilver> but i don't think they teach all of the sanda takedowns
[10:34:04] <tcsilver> or conditioning
[10:34:30] <tcsilver> can you teach me some buddhsit studies ?
[10:34:36] <tcsilver> in just a few words ?
[10:34:41] <tcsilver> or is it forbidden or such ?
[10:34:45] <tcsilver> I want to learn :3
[10:35:02] <tcsilver> i like the 10 wholesome ways
[10:35:12] <tcsilver> of pureland buddhism
[10:35:36] <tcsilver> and I like the 4 noble truths, the 8 fold path, the 6 realms.. the 6 perfections... and other stuff
[10:35:38] <amigojapan> But forbidden. But not sure what to teach in a few words, and maybe I don't then much of what the monk has taught me

[11:38:18] <ButterNoodle> I would go as far as calling them anarchists, but even anarchists seem to have a cause or purpose

[11:39:16] <JesseDesu> yoo
[11:39:19] <amigojapan> Hi emmeka 
[11:39:23] <ButterNoodle> its emmeka 
[11:39:30] <emmeka> amigojapan to clarify, "antifa" is a kind of shorthand for the antifascist movement at large, and usually refers to a specific kind of leftist activist
[11:39:55] <amigojapan> I see emmeka 
[11:40:03] <ButterNoodle> they are organized by capitalist dollars... travel in packs on nice busses
[11:40:08] <emmeka> I wish
[11:40:21] <emmeka> where's my Soros cheque when I need it
[11:40:27] <ButterNoodle> its in the mail
[11:40:33] <ButterNoodle> along with ur blm check
[11:40:46] <ButterNoodle> thanks for ur vote, here's ur brick
[11:41:22] <ButterNoodle> I'm surprised they passed on the opportunity to burn down louisville
[11:41:44] <ButterNoodle> they only had a few people *actually peacefully protesting downtown
[11:42:00] <ButterNoodle> I'm surprised they passed on the opportunity to burn down louisville *again
[11:42:22] <emmeka> amigojapan you'll often see people, especially on the right, frame antifa as if it is an organization or coordinated force. this is not the case. antifa is more of a lose movement or notion, coupled with a particular style of activism
[11:42:28] <JesseDesu> my hp tablet i was issued for work had its battery depleted and now i'm plugged in only mode

[11:43:44] <emmeka> ButterNoodle I spent plenty of time bumming the eastern seaboard in all sorts of leftist circles when I was younger and had the energy to care
[11:43:44] <amigojapan> I see emmeka 
[11:43:45] <ButterNoodle> amigojapan: I'd have to dig logs.. probably
[11:44:04] <amigojapan> That's ok ButterNoodle 
[11:44:05] <ButterNoodle> emmeka: was that 2020?
[11:44:28] <emmeka> no. but it's not as if anything has changed. if anything, our antifascists are more willing to be violent than yours.
[11:44:51] <emmeka> just see how things go in the east end of Montr√©al
[11:44:59] <ButterNoodle> amigojapan: greppin it
[11:45:14] <amigojapan> Thanks ButterNoodle 
[11:47:17] <ButterNoodle> emmeka: yea I wish americans would get their dicks out of their asses and fight for something.. instead of crying like little pussies about everything not going their way
[11:48:04] <ButterNoodle> amigojapan: htrptr was in his hostname.. and I think he tried ban evade a few times
[11:48:18] <emmeka> well, they've tried on occasion. I can't blame the yanks for your institutions being harder to break.
[11:48:29] <amigojapan> I see ButterNoodle Ty
[11:48:59] <ButterNoodle> emmeka: I mean ig they have tried to get more violent...
[11:49:08] <ButterNoodle> they fucked around and found out..
[11:49:23] <emmeka> but also, the lol part is that the basic problem and major failing with the American left is the thing the right accuses them of succeeding at: centralized, coordinated organization and action
[11:49:32] <emmeka> it's kind of strange to me how this whole narrative came to be
[11:49:51] * ButterNoodle lines up a rittenhouse... a chaser followed by three shots
[11:49:53] <ButterNoodle> bottoms up
[11:50:06] <ButterNoodle> idk how its strange
[11:50:10] <tcsilver> it's time for pizza
[11:50:44] <ButterNoodle> when its factual.. well not the succeeding part.. and its not really this coordinated centralized thing either
[11:51:12] <emmeka> somehow the American right became totally convinced that there is a well-coordinated, well-funded organization of leftist activists capable of massing anywhere at any time that poses a legitimate threat to the United States
[11:52:07] <emmeka> anyone who has been remotely involved with leftist orgs knows this is the opposite of the truth
[11:52:17] <ButterNoodle> your only about 1/2 wrong on every comment ur saying tho
[11:53:29] *** Quits: weeb (~libera@e1.nixmagic.com) (Ping timeout: 246 seconds)
[11:55:17] <emmeka> like, I can assure you, there is no antifa organization. There's barely such a thing as an "organization" involving anarchists anyway. Put 4 of them in a room and it'll take 10 hours of general assembly to reach consensus.
[11:55:45] <ButterNoodle> you know thats not what I mean..
[11:56:21] <ButterNoodle> they dont wear little sashes with merit badges on them or go to meetings
[11:56:22] <emmeka> well I don't necessarily mean you, though you did seem to buy into that narrative at least a little
[11:56:53] <emmeka> I mean more broadly, somehow this is a conception people came up with of what "antifa" is but it doesn't reflect reality at all
[11:58:19] <ButterNoodle> u ever see busloads of "peaceful protesters" from out of town show up in ur city?
[11:58:31] <emmeka> sure, I've done it.
[11:59:07] <ButterNoodle> ok then... we are clear on the facts, just not the definition
[12:00:32] <emmeka> antifa is a label that you can slap on anyone who will show up at demos alongside people who fit an antifa aesthetic. this runs the gamut of hundreds of organizations, and many more people who just run in the same circles as people in those organizations, and many more people who are just friends of those people and etc
[12:03:33] <emmeka> like, I've done this, I've been a ~bused in protester~, I've been to many major events of unrest in my own time. I was among the 1200 people arrested and held in makeshift jail cells at G20 2010, I was at Occupy Wall St in 2011, I was on the streets during the student strike of 2012 in Qu√©bec that toppled the Charest government.
[12:04:15] <emmeka> and I just find the whole sort of notion that everyone has developed about how leftist organizing happens to be really amusing, because it vastly overestimates them
[12:07:20] *** Quits: abip20 (~abdullah@user/abip20) (Quit: Konversation terminated!)
[12:11:05] <emmeka> I especially like the notion that people are PAID to do this, and somehow everyone believes this to be fact
[12:14:39] <amigojapan> emmeka: well he said terrorist. That is why I was surprised
[12:15:11] <emmeka> well that's less of an issue than describing them as a group or organization
[12:15:22] <amigojapan> Ok
[12:15:27] <emmeka> I mean, lots of self-professed antifa have committed political violence
[12:15:40] <amigojapan> I see
[12:15:45] <emmeka> which is if you stare at it the right way with the right shade of glasses, terrorism
[12:16:01] <amigojapan> I see
[12:17:54] <amigojapan> Eventho I am leftist I am agsist violence
[12:18:06] <emmeka> my point is more that there is no such thing as antifa as an organization, it is more a movement, an aesthetic, an idea. Different people and different groups self-identify as antifa, but none of them are coordinated and many of them care about completely different things,

[12:20:06] <emmeka> showing up whenever there's a riot or protest or random tweet that they seen or whatever
[12:21:02] <mathu> agree with emmeka that people who think leftists are effective organizers are either liars or scared of a boogeyman

[12:26:36] <mathu> when seattle had that Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone thing i lurked the twitter hashtags for a few nights. never saw this corroborated by actual press but during the period where cops and ambulances weren't servicing the area someone came through with a truck and some assault rifles presumably up to no good. the armed presence there shot the people in the truck. not ideal but understandable so far - what 
[12:26:42] <mathu> pissed me off was seeing a tweet here and there about it every half hour or so and apparently it took two full hours before they took the guy to a fucking hospital. i respect what street medics do but you gotta stop pretending if someone got shot
[12:26:58] <mathu> CHAZ was literally an anarchist LARP / ska music festival. it was ridiculous
[12:27:12] <mathu> i am seriously grateful it ended seemingly without more gun standoffs and violence
[12:28:47] <mathu> i was kind of cynical about american leftists before that but CHAZ kind of cemented it. just unserious people
[12:28:55] <emmeka> mathu imagine that but like it went on for weeks and also there was a whole mythology about consensus among thousands of people being necessary for any decision
[12:28:56] <mathu> (my politics are pretty leftist!)
[12:29:00] <emmeka> this is what Occupy was like
[12:29:24] <mathu> emmeka: yeah it's like, how can literal anarchists have slower corporate bureaucracy than my employer of 50k
[12:29:47] <emmeka> by trying really, really hard to do so
[12:30:09] <emmeka> because form is all that matters, I guess

[12:31:37] <Sapphirus> Fact that antifa will show up and oppose protests that are actually about government overreach just goes to show how anti-fascist these people are.
[12:31:41] <mathu> yeah i should get to bed, gotta get up early
[12:32:16] <emmeka> Sapphirus hey now, equal opportunity, people can protest about what they believe to be government overreach and still be fascists
[12:32:37] <emmeka> no need to limit yourself
[12:32:49] <emmeka> mathu nn
[12:33:10] <Sapphirus> You could argue that, but you would also have to apply the same logic to antifa since it's a 'loose collective'.
[12:33:55] <Sapphirus> There's definitely people who wear that badge who have fascist beliefs.
[12:34:09] <emmeka> you could, but it'd be a pretty hard sell to argue that a movement whose entire notion is "counteract fascists" is, itself, fascist
[12:34:13] <Urchin[emacs]> "government overreach" is often a dogwhistle about, for example, opposing programs feeding the poor
[12:35:01] <emmeka> I mean, normally I'd like to see someone try to reconcile that, but I oughta go tuck mathu in and then go to bed
[12:35:09] <Sapphirus> Government overreach is more like vaccine mandates and really any authoritarian government overreach supported by leftists, just because.
[12:35:33] <Sapphirus> There's no real rationalisation behind it. Which is why I don't take the movement seriously and I find it to be extremely hypocritical.
[12:36:29] <Sapphirus> I'd say it's more a manifestation of me vs. them than anything
[12:36:44] <Sapphirus> You could give it any name and that'd still be true.

[12:43:09] <Urchin[emacs]> it was a considered a good trade off for not fucking dying of plague
[12:43:12] <Sapphirus> How can you justify welding doors shut, though? It's one thing to get people to quarantine, it's another to make sure they can't even leave to get food.
[12:43:31] <Sapphirus> And as we know now, COVID isn't so bad to even be able to justify this sort of action.
[12:43:58] <Urchin[emacs]> Sapphirus: I never heard about welding doors shut
[12:44:56] <Urchin[emacs]> Sapphirus: anyway, doesn't sound like anything people would do in any of the modern representative democracies anyway, so that's an argument that's beside the point except in some insane fantasy
[12:46:22] <Sapphirus> There's tons of video footage online of it.

[12:48:04] <Sapphirus> It's not an insane fantasy when we're talking about whether or not you're an actual anti-fascist anarchist or just a poser.
[12:48:37] <Sapphirus> Either you support the government telling you what to do with your own body or you don't. You'd think an anarchist wouldn't want any government at all.

[14:25:59] <Cryowolf> but 75" might be overkill
[14:26:04] <amigojapan> Cryowolf: I have never bought one, but sounds expensive
[14:26:28] <amigojapan> Oh 75 inches. I see
[14:26:30] <darkwitch> no, it sounds very cheap

[15:10:05] <amigojapan> darkwitch: you can put electronics into distilled water
[15:10:20] <darkwitch> amigojapan??
[15:12:43] <darkwitch> are you saying the linux desktop can get clean and smelling lovely without using soap?
[15:14:16] <DPA> You should first carefully wash the electronics while they are off if you want to put them in water. They can contain salty components which can turn distilled water into conductive salt water.
[15:15:01] <DPA> People usually prefer to put them in oil, though.
[15:15:17] <darkwitch> isn't it just software?
[15:16:12] <MootPoot> this guy says KDE plasma is the best current modern desktop?
[15:16:53] <Bco1981> MootPoot: kde3+ and gnome3 got heavy to use.
[15:17:00] <amigojapan> darkwitch: I am no chemist, but soap may make the water conductive
[15:17:20] <MootPoot> Bco1981: define heavy
[15:17:28] <Bco1981> the hardware support in linux isn't always the latest and greatest.
[15:17:39] <MootPoot> heavy as in "my 200mb ram pentium 4 can't run it in 2013"
[15:17:45] <amigojapan> DPA: oil for washing?
[15:18:02] <MootPoot> or heavy as in "average computers sold within the last 3 years lag"
[15:18:05] <Bco1981> MootPoot: heavy as in laggy, slow response
[15:18:12] <DPA> No, some people run them in there. Better heat conductance.
[15:18:26] <Bco1981> long load times
[15:18:34] <amigojapan> Ah gotcha DPA 
[15:18:38] <MootPoot> how long?
[15:18:45] <MootPoot> is it due to the HDD meta
[15:18:51] <Bco1981> probably
[15:18:58] <Bco1981> there was only hdd back then

[15:22:05] <Sadale> MootPoot, try asking in ##electronics. The people there are better at electronic stuffs. I'm just a noob+. They're pros.
[15:22:14] <Sadale> MootPoot, get a better regulator xD
[15:22:46] * Sadale googles LM2596S
[15:23:09] <Sadale> MootPoot, wow. That's for high power application. I'm not a professional in this topic. Please ask for help elsewhere. I'm sorry
[15:23:12] <DPA> I did that by accident once with a USB drive once. It's fine if they are powered off and very well dried before usage.
[15:23:21] <MootPoot> high power?
[15:23:26] <MootPoot> its only like 15w
[15:23:27] <Sadale> 3A is like a lot to me.
[15:23:36] <Sadale> It isn't that high. But it's far higher than I usually handle.
[15:23:37] <amigojapan> MootPoot: you can step down the voltage of 0.4v by adding some resistors
[15:23:59] <Sadale> MootPoot, I've designed electronics that handles that much power. So you better to ask someone else/
[15:24:00] <amigojapan> I see DPA 
[15:24:37] <MootPoot> Sadale: yeah, okay
[15:24:49] <JesseDesu> my gloves feel so nice
[15:24:56] <JesseDesu> and warm
[15:25:22] <MootPoot> thanks for looking tho Sadale 
[15:25:30] <JesseDesu> its like a cocoon
[15:26:07] <MootPoot> although now I dont really need the atomic pi anymore
[15:26:15] <MootPoot> as much since I got that xeon server
[15:29:21] <Sadale> MootPoot, gift the atomic pi to me xD
[15:29:36] <amigojapan> MootPoot: do you have somewhere to put it where the noise Wynne affect you?
[15:29:48] <MootPoot> for the price of shipping you could probably just get a new one lol

[15:48:39] <darkwitch> amigojapan, it is understandable. even so, it suffers from some basic issues that can be corrected
[15:49:02] <Sadale> ezekielnoob, lolwut? Don't do that or you may die xD
[15:49:11] <amigojapan> darkwitch: people complain less about other accents
[15:49:13] <ezekielnoob> i mean fasting Sadale
[15:49:15] <ezekielnoob> lol
[15:49:24] <ezekielnoob> like just eating within 2-4 hours a day
[15:49:27] <ezekielnoob> i've donme it before

[15:49:59] <Sadale> ezekielnoob, why tho? For fun? :3
[15:50:15] <amigojapan> darkwitch: right, but you could train computers to recognize it as valid too

[15:51:26] <Sadale> ezekielnoob, guess what? To me either fapping and restrain from fapping are fun xD
[15:51:42] <Macer> i was watching youtube police chase videos and realized that every scenario was something i had done in gta5
[15:52:00] <ezekielnoob> Sadale your fun comes from dogging the people that failed the challenge :p
[15:52:02] <darkwitch> saying "excuse" is different from saying „Ç®„ÇØ„Çπ„Ç≠„É•„Éº„Ç∫, which adds extra vowels that should not be there

[15:54:09] <darkwitch> Bco1981, that's easy because the original is spoken out loud and also written on the screen
[15:54:20] <Sadale> ezekielnoob, I wonder what's the usual cost of housing there in Manila? And is there any tax for purchasing condo/houses there?
[15:54:25] <amigojapan> Bco1981: darkwitch I suspect "raiburarii"is also part of the problem
[15:54:35] <ezekielnoob> there's a small tax
[15:54:46] <ezekielnoob> how big is the house u want tho Sadale
[15:54:46] <Bco1981> darkwitch: you would still get it even not looking at the screen.
[15:55:00] <ezekielnoob> my current house which is around 120SQM is probably 100k USD
[15:55:10] <Sadale> ezekielnoob, wow. That's cheap.
[15:55:13] <ezekielnoob> but there's cheaper areas
[15:55:19] <ezekielnoob> there's also more expensive ones
[15:55:31] <Sadale> ezekielnoob, here the cost of a tiny apartment (30msq) is like 500k
[15:55:40] <darkwitch> then it depends on how strict you want the test to be
[15:55:45] <ezekielnoob> okay for 500k u can get an amazing house here Sadale
[15:55:46] <Sadale> ezekielnoob, anyway I don't think foreigners are allowed to purchase houses there.
[15:55:56] <Sadale> ezekielnoob, lol not that I'd be willing to throw 500k at housing at all.
[15:56:12] <ezekielnoob> oh yueah hmm that's a good point about foreigners
[15:56:19] <ezekielnoob> i guess u can rent one
[15:56:21] <Sadale> yep.
[15:56:23] <ezekielnoob> but it's gonna be cheap also
[15:56:27] <Sadale> Or get a condo
[15:56:27] <Bco1981> darkwitch: yeah... for the test it ofcourse has to be very close. but if you meet a person on the street. you would understand what she is saying.,
[15:56:30] <Bco1981> .
[15:56:33] <Sadale> ezekielnoob, I think condo are more expensive there ttho
[15:56:58] <Sadale> ezekielnoob, Here barely anyone get houses because they're all built in rural area. And no one wants to live there.
[15:57:32] <darkwitch> .
[15:57:49] <Sadale> ezekielnoob, Do you have any idea on how much condo would cost there? :o
[15:58:12] <ezekielnoob> maybe $200-$500 a month
[15:58:16] <Sadale> apartment or condo (I guess they're the same?)
[15:58:20] <Sadale> ezekielnoob, oh I mean purchasing them.
[15:58:20] <ezekielnoob> depends on where or how big
[15:58:29] <ezekielnoob> no idea that much on condos
[15:58:31] <ezekielnoob> i don't like condos
[15:58:33] <ezekielnoob> i like houses :p
[15:58:48] <ezekielnoob> but
[15:58:53] <ezekielnoob> you'll find a condo for you for sure
[15:58:54] <amigojapan> darkwitch: I think that way if testing is unfair

[16:17:54] <amigojapan> Let me Google it
[16:17:58] <ezekielnoob> Temperature mode and then RGB mode
[16:18:13] <ezekielnoob> i suppose it uses different LEDs for the white-tungsten vs the colors

[16:49:16] <amigojapan> Well she drinks it too
[16:50:10] <darkwitch> you have to drink something
[16:50:26] <darkwitch> if it's not going to be water, then milk will do
[16:51:15] <amigojapan> darkwitch: I tried mixing instant coffee into mugicha, and then adding creme I got from a restaurant for my coffee today

[16:52:46] <amigojapan> Buying creme may end up being expresive too. Let me check the price of the powder one

[17:00:07] <darkwitch> is it cheaper than buying water?
[17:01:16] <amigojapan> Just a little more expensive. But tomako seems to be counting it as a nessesary expense

[17:06:03] <darkwitch> 50 yen and 80 yen per liter

[17:06:48] <amigojapan> I see darkwitch that's a difference alright
[17:09:26] <amigojapan> darkwitch: it is odd that I need to change my drinking habits and she does not tho
[17:09:49] <amigojapan> Maybe I will try to get her to drink water
[17:10:58] <darkwitch> it's a cheaper solution in the long run
[17:11:32] <amigojapan> Yeah. She should drink water and I should drink black coffee

[18:39:09] <Bco1981> guess i need to make a folder for semi kid friendly anime...
[18:40:19] <JesseDesu> did your kid find your hentai
[18:40:40] <Bco1981> the problem is most of the ones i have are ecchi ones
[18:41:09] <JesseDesu> so the answer is yes
[18:41:37] <Bco1981> my son has a bit of tourrette, and is a bit mentally behind his classmates... he don't need to watch ecchi stuff until he is 16
[18:42:18] <Bco1981> academically he is on par with his classmates. but he should have been in one class lower.
[18:42:31] <Bco1981> socially
[18:42:43] <Cryowolf> Bco1981, why can't he watch ecchi then?
[18:42:54] <JesseDesu> so your son is a tank
[18:42:58] <JesseDesu> he has turrets
[18:43:10] <Sadale> Bco1981, feed him hentai
[18:43:14] <Bco1981> i don't want him to get the idea that nudity at school is a normal thing
[18:43:22] <Sadale> aw
[18:43:32] <Sadale> just don't show him school-related ecchi/hentai

[18:43:59] <JesseDesu> like what
[18:44:20] <JesseDesu> i want some titles
[18:44:22] <Bco1981> JesseDesu: a mild case, he just makes some sounds. but he has been pressured into full auto, so he could not stop making sounds.
[18:44:24] <RenAdjest> Hm... "Kid Friendly".... I guess Madoka are kid friendly since it's not ecchi
[18:44:36] <Cryowolf> Bco1981, is his social development that challenged?
[18:44:36] <Bco1981> RenAdjest: blood, killing.
[18:45:13] <Sadale> If I had a son wouldn't give a damn about his whatever development. :p
[18:45:27] <Bco1981> Cryowolf: no, he just has problem getting along with kids in his class. he can't make prober advances into a conversation and says stupid or dumb remarks.
[18:45:28] <Sadale> Just don't get me into trouble. That's it xD
[18:45:42] <JesseDesu> hmm
[18:45:49] <Sadale> Bco1981, oh this kind of person. I used to be this kind of kid >_<
[18:45:58] <Bco1981> well i'm not gonna let him become some shit head.
[18:46:04] <Sadale> Bco1981, guess why? That's because I've got this kind of stupid data :<
[18:46:04] <JesseDesu> if i had a son i'd play catch and teach him to ride a bike
[18:46:06] <Bco1981> not, accepted.
[18:46:30] <Sadale> if I had a son I'd show him eromanga and hentai
[18:46:37] <Bco1981> intime
[18:46:40] <Cryowolf> I understood these things just fine as a kid, that those things don't happen and that there's a difference between fiction and reality. And it's not like I didn't have my struggles.I can DM you about it if it would give you some perspective Bco1981. and if you can keep it in confidence
[18:46:53] <MootPoot> I wish I had some more cash
[18:46:54] <MootPoot> lol
[18:47:02] <JesseDesu> cash for hentai
[18:47:10] <Sadale> cash for onaholes and buttplugs
[18:47:26] <Sadale> oh let's not forget sex toy. I'd totally buy my son sex toys if I had one
[18:47:39] <JesseDesu> ...
[18:47:45] <Bco1981> Cryowolf: that's okay, it's not like he is far out struggeling, we just have a lot of contact with the school.
[18:47:47] <Sadale> That's sex ed!
[18:48:05] <Bco1981> but i won't let him watch ecchi shows to make things worse for him at school.
[18:48:17] <Bco1981> until he is older.
[18:48:25] <Sadale> Bco1981, maybe he had already discovered ecchi on his own without you knowing it :P
[18:48:52] <Bco1981> he probably has found porn on the internet. but he won't be able to use his computer for it
[18:48:54] <MootPoot> I should return these LED RGB lights
[18:49:01] <Sadale> MootPoot, Just wondering, if you save up any money
[18:49:03] <MootPoot> I mean they look really cool but after a while
[18:49:07] <JesseDesu> the kid will login to a friends unrestricted computer and will find out about the world
[18:49:10] <MootPoot> 150 bucks is a bit much
[18:49:15] <MootPoot> for looks
[18:49:26] <Bco1981> if his phone is on my wifi, he won't be able to use that for it either.
[18:49:40] <Sadale> Bco1981, how do you block him from doing that tho?
[18:49:42] <Cryowolf> Eh....I disagree with you there. I don't see why he would think fiction is reality
[18:49:47] <MootPoot> Sadale:  why~ do you wanna know :P
[18:49:50] <JesseDesu> i have about 3.8K in the bank and i want to splurge on an M1 ipad

[18:50:01] <Cryowolf> cause its none of our business
[18:50:06] <Matt|home> maybe one day i won't be in pain.. who knows..
[18:50:10] <Sadale> MootPoot, just curious. You always talk about buying this buying that and all of those stuffs you're buying are not cheap
[18:50:18] <Bco1981> Sadale: miraki firewall has layer7 firewall and known sites are blocked.
[18:50:22] <Sadale> MootPoot, it makes me wonder if you barely save up anything
[18:50:28] <RenAdjest> Why don't you try the reverse? Show him the most hardcore hentai ever. Maybe he'll so scared he will never touch hentai again.
[18:50:30] <JesseDesu> he hustles
[18:50:37] <MootPoot> Sadale: I dont save any currently - any money that I currently save just goes into my student loan
[18:50:42] <Cryowolf> RenAdjest, let him play Euphoria
[18:50:43] <MootPoot> but otherwise I would save some
[18:50:55] <Sadale> Bco1981, ah. I guess the internet of your own devices aren't restricted by the firewall then.
[18:51:00] <Bco1981> Sadale: my kids can't use omeegl or whats it called.
[18:51:01] <Sadale> MootPoot, aw
[18:51:04] <Cryowolf> the game is so much more fucked up than the anime on every level
[18:51:11] <Bco1981> Sadale: yeah mine arnt.
[18:51:16] <Sadale> Bco1981, cheater :P
[18:51:19] <MootPoot> Sadale: when I'm done paying off my loan I'll start saving the same amount I pay
[18:51:25] <Sadale> not allowing your kids to watch porn while you're watching them on your own xD
[18:51:31] <Sadale> hypocrite :P
[18:51:41] <Sadale> MootPoot, cool! :3
[18:51:59] <JesseDesu> sadale would you spank your kid
[18:52:07] <Sadale> JesseDesu, nope
[18:52:11] <JesseDesu> i thought so
[18:52:26] <JesseDesu> i was spanked
[18:52:28] <Sadale> JesseDesu, not sure if what I'm saying would go if I've actually got a kid tho
[18:52:30] <Sadale> JesseDesu, me too
[18:52:31] <JesseDesu> i deserved it
[18:52:33] <Sadale> lol

[18:52:50] <Bco1981> Sadale: it even blocks gelbooru...
[18:52:56] <Sadale> Bco1981, :(
[18:53:02] <Sadale> Bco1981, I feel bad for your son
[18:53:02] <Cryowolf> Imagine this scenario where they're both masturbating at the same time, to the same video. Finish and throw away the paper in the same location, 10 seconds apart and wash their hands in the same sink before having a father-son hug
[18:53:06] <JesseDesu> gotta stick to asian values
[18:53:42] <Bco1981> Cryowolf: more like high five.
[18:53:45] <JesseDesu> does it block danbooru
[18:53:49] <Sadale> JesseDesu, I think I'd stay virgin for the rest of my life. So no kids for me. No gf for me.
[18:53:51] <JesseDesu> or is that safe
[18:53:53] <Bco1981> we are sitting back to back
[18:54:08] <Bco1981> JesseDesu: i think so it did
[18:54:30] <Bco1981> my rpi was blocked trying to open that so i had to whitelist it,
[18:54:40] <Cryowolf> Bco1981, doing down low fives and behind our heads back to support each other as you both arch your backs off the chair?

[19:18:23] <Sadale> great. DST handling of my IoT seems to be working correctly :3
[19:18:29] <Sadale> Still need to further test it tho.
[19:18:41] <Sadale> I'm at a disadvantage as a developer because wherever I'm living in has no DST.

[19:19:01] <MootPoot> IoT
[19:19:06] <MootPoot> that's a bad word here
[19:19:26] <Sadale> Satin, I remember that you asked question of getting your book database C program to work like years ago.
[19:19:46] <Sadale> MootPoot, lol but mine's different. It requires minimal internet connection. It doesn't collect user data. :3
[19:21:55] <MootPoot> still has so many security issues
[19:22:04] <MootPoot> well - just keep it walled off
[19:22:09] <MootPoot> and that should be fine
[19:22:14] <Sadale> true. I try to mitigate it by using the latest version of SDK
[19:22:24] <MootPoot> what are you doing with it
[19:22:38] <Sadale> But if there's a bug on the upstream SDK, there isn't much I could do on it other than providing security update to the users.

[19:23:16] <Satin> but oh well
[19:24:37] <Sadale> MootPoot, you interested? I'm thinking if I should look for testers for this product. But it'd take a while until the tester-ready version's available. xD
[19:26:32] <MootPoot> if it dosen't use too many parts I can just replicate it here
[19:26:53] <Sadale> MootPoot, oh I mean I could just ship a unit to you.
[19:27:27] <MootPoot> isen't it massive
[19:27:53] <Sadale> MootPoot, nope. It's still being revised. Let me check the dimensions
[19:29:32] <Sadale> MootPoot, less than 14x3.5x2cm. I plan to shrink the 14cm part into 10cm-ish in my next iteration, which would become the tester's version.
[19:30:33] <Sadale> MootPoot, Features: FOSS, automated DST handling, no Y2036/2038 problem, no telemetry reporting, highly configurable displayed content (supports format string and even custom animation), customizable alarm tones
[19:31:23] <Sadale> oh. And the alarm config would be rather flexible :3

[21:39:51] <ButterNoodle> zoidberg: yes... its funny, I get a lot of vegetarian dishes when I eat indian foods
[21:40:21] <ButterNoodle> maybe bc my indian friends were all vegetarian and gave good recommendations
[21:40:44] <zoidberg> I‚Äôm non vegetarian.
[21:40:58] <zoidberg> ButterNoodle: where are your Indian friends from?
[21:41:13] <zoidberg> Anyone from Bangalore or Hyderabad?
[21:42:05] <ButterNoodle> all over.. chennai mumbai new deli
[21:43:09] <ButterNoodle> ahh yes there was one guy from hyderabad
[21:43:33] <zoidberg> That‚Äôs nice.
[21:43:43] <ButterNoodle> idk if it was just him.. but he was a connoisseur of the spiciest stuffs
[21:44:08] <zoidberg> Yeah, we eat quite spicy stuff.
[21:44:53] <zoidberg> I‚Äôm from Hyderabad though I have business in Hyderabad and Bangalore.
[21:45:04] <ButterNoodle> we got along well at dinner time.. I'd be breaking a sweat on some of the foods and he would ask.. "is that too hot?"
[21:45:22] <ButterNoodle> I'd say... *almost ;)
[21:46:02] <zoidberg> What kind of dish? Do you remember name?
[21:46:30] *** Joins: xkuru (~xkuru@user/xkuru)
[21:47:02] <zoidberg> By the way almost no one eats spicy food daily. It‚Äôs just once in a while thing.
[21:47:24] <zoidberg> Most of the times it‚Äôs normal tasting food.
[21:48:02] <zoidberg> I made pasta afternoon.
[21:48:03] <ButterNoodle> I wanna say it was some biryani?
[21:48:16] <zoidberg> Ah, that‚Äôs spicy.
[21:48:42] <ButterNoodle> yea I shared some w my boss in exchange for some paneer...
[21:49:05] <zoidberg> But it‚Äôs okay if you don‚Äôt mix it with that sauce, it‚Äôs called mirchi ka salan. The red stuff.
[21:49:14] <ButterNoodle> his immediate response was "how the fuck are you eating this" as he choked down a glass of water
[21:49:19] <zoidberg> Amigo loves paneer.
[21:49:24] <ButterNoodle> I love it
[21:49:32] <zoidberg> Saag paneer is his fav.
[21:49:34] <ButterNoodle> no matter what its cooked in
[21:50:04] <zoidberg> Btw whenever you attend a function, there‚Äôs paneer dish almost every time.
[21:50:14] <ButterNoodle> I like saags as long as they arent too heavy on tomatos
[21:50:31] <zoidberg> You don‚Äôt like tomato?
[21:51:07] <ButterNoodle> not really.. I eat tomato as an incidence of the dish.. I dont want a dish that is primarily tomato

[21:52:05] <ButterNoodle> yes, but its part of the dish
[21:52:09] <ButterNoodle> *I dont mind it
[21:52:27] <zoidberg> Do you use tomato pur√©e?
[21:52:39] <ButterNoodle> like some of the mexican restaurants here will serve a dish with a big fucking slab of tomato on top..
[21:52:49] <ButterNoodle> yes yes.. puree is fine
[21:53:00] <zoidberg> Ugh, yeah, I have been there.
[21:53:13] <ButterNoodle> like wtf am I gonna do with this...
[21:53:26] <ButterNoodle> I eat pico de gallo
[21:53:29] <ButterNoodle> salsa
[21:53:31] <ButterNoodle> etc
[21:53:35] <zoidberg> There‚Äôs this French dish which I forgot the name has tomato with filling. I ate that once, which is awesome.
[21:53:39] <ButterNoodle> something about textures tho
[21:53:52] <zoidberg> Tacos have tomatoes too right?
[21:53:57] <ButterNoodle> depends
[21:54:02] <ButterNoodle> cheap tacos.. no
[21:54:19] <ButterNoodle> I dont like tomatoes in tacos or burritos
[21:54:29] <zoidberg> Oh really? Lol. Tomatoes are like the cheapest vegetable here.
[21:54:53] <ButterNoodle> u get fast food tacos here its just meat lettuce chease

[22:29:45] <Nanobot> My work computer is frozen. For some reason, both my work computer and my personal computer have been having this issue where the disk cache suddenly grows out of control and I run out of memory. After like 30 minutes, some random process gets terminated, and the cache shrinks again and becomes responsive. I sort of solved it on my personal computer by having it clear the disk cache every night.
[22:30:22] <Nanobot> These two computers use completely different hardware, different distro versions, etc. But they both started having this issue around the same time.
[22:31:03] <Bco1981> after a updatE?
[22:32:36] <Nanobot> I don't know. At first, I only noticed it on my personal computer, and I assumed it was the RAM going bad. On my work computer, I noticed that Slack would randomly be crashed when I switched over to that computer, but I initially assumed it was just Slack being unstable. Turns out it's the exact same thing, and it sometimes crashes other processes, such as Firefox tabs.
[22:37:14] <Nanobot> I have a hunch that it may be related to Firefox, actually.
