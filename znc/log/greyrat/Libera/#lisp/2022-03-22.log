[01:00:43] <pjb> In lisp, we can mutate things, but we can also avoid it.  So we have operators that may share structure, and other that may re-use the allocated memory, and by being a little careful (adopting different programming styles), we avoid most problem, while having at our finger tips the tools to write efficient code when needed (mutation, without over copying).

[02:50:27] <pjb> theseb: what lisp do you know? This is fairly common lisp…
[02:51:28] <pjb> theseb: the environments you create at function calls only contain the parameters of the function.  The arguments have been computed before that.  You store references to the arguments in the parameter variables of the new environment.
[02:52:43] <pjb> theseb: the link between your stack of environment and the heap, is that the stack of environment is automatically added to the rootset of the heap: all the objects that can be referenced from the stack of environments are deemed alive.
[02:53:01] <pjb> theseb: therefore when you return from a function, you only have to pop its environment and that's it.
[02:53:55] <pjb> theseb: note: those environments themselves can be stored on the heap. This is a simple solution for closures: you can use the same environments for closures (at the cost of keeping some objects alive longer than they should because of the closures).
[02:54:22] <pjb> theseb: I could advise this book to learn how to implement a lisp: Lisp in Small Pieces   http://pagesperso-systeme.lip6.fr/Christian.Queinnec/WWW/LiSP.html  http://pagesperso-systeme.lip6.fr/Christian.Queinnec/Books/LiSP-2ndEdition-2006Dec11.tgz
[02:54:40] <theseb> pjb: i wrote a basic one..i know the basics of schme and CL
[02:55:13] <theseb> pjb: man..you sure know this stuff well...
[02:55:21] <theseb> you could teach it
[02:56:17] <pjb> theseb: you may also study how existing implementations do it. and watch how a new implementation is being implemented in #sicl 
[02:57:34] <theseb> pjb: you said " The arguments have been computed before that.  You store references to the arguments in the parameter variables of the new environment."
[02:58:35] <pjb> Well, this would be one way to do it. Another indeed, would be to create the environment, and to store the arguments as they are computed.
[02:59:20] <pjb> creating the environment first would avoid a little problem of having to add the computed objects to the root-set.
[02:59:43] <theseb> pjb: but when you do (f sexp-1 sexp-2 sexp-3) ....you only evaluate sexp-1, sexp-2, sexp-3 for the invocation...so they don't exist beyond
[02:59:44] <theseb> ?
[03:00:16] <pjb> they could exist after the end of the execution of f, if they're stored in some data structure or returned from the function call.
[03:00:43] <theseb> pjb: yes! 
[03:01:27] <theseb> pjb: you *might* erase invocation stuff...you may not...ok i think that is what i was looking for

[03:04:27] <theseb> pjb: "they could exist after the end of the execution of f, if they're stored in some data structure or returned from the function call." <=--- i didn't know that was allowed...i thought there was some rule "Thou must always erase everything after execution of function" for some reason

[03:11:20] <pjb> theseb: the variables and the slots contain a reference to a lisp object.
[03:11:48] <pjb> theseb: the variables storage is on the stack; the slot storage is in lisp objects (vector, arrays, structures, objects).
[03:12:15] <holycow> oh hot damn
[03:12:16] <pjb> (a parameter is a variable; an argument is a value aka lisp object).
[03:13:02] <pjb> Since variables and slots only contain references to objects, they can contain references to any type (or class) of objects.
[03:13:25] <pjb> On the other hand, the type  is a property of a lisp object, of the values.  Not of the variables.
