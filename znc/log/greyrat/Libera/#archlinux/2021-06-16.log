[10:07:50] <aminvakil> also by wait until it's fixed, i mean downgrade the package so it still works

[18:01:40] <horseface> i have no idea, tbh...
[18:01:43] <horseface> i do not think so.
[18:01:53] <horseface> it uses just a login username and password...

For the life of me, none of the distros I've tried can actually get the darn display to work on the second HDMI port, only the first. The best I can tell, its using the i915 driver. Anyone see issues with 11th gen intel procs and integrated

[23:03:33] <rakyah> Hey hey people, I wanted to ask a question on the topic of battery life, in particular how to prevent degeradation. I just got an x380 Yoga and a new battery, as the old one was only able to hold 50% of the intented charge. Since receiving this new battery, I charged and discharged it once, though it is charging rn. After checking with tlp-stat, its already down by 3%
[23:03:54] <jonathon> all batteries have a life span and will degrade over time
[23:04:02] <NoImNotNineVolt> :'(
[23:04:05] <rakyah> How do I prevent this? I already set the max charge threshhold to 80% and all. Does it make a diffrence between 90w and 65w chargers?
[23:04:07] <jonathon> you can limit wear by not letting them get hot

[23:04:23] <jonathon> you can't prevent batteries from wearing out
[23:04:24] <rakyah> Thats true, but 3% after a day seem outrageous
[23:04:50] <jonathon> it's probably just calibrating
[23:05:05] <rakyah> Though my question is more on the topic of would a 65w charger maybe make a diffrence in prolongint the lifespan, compared to a 90w
[23:05:08] <rakyah> or is it negliable
[23:05:10] <jonathon> you'll probably find the initial capacity was over 100%, and it will adjust from there
[23:05:46] *** Joins: HawkinsTheWizard (~HawkinsTh@102.39.93.144)
[23:05:54] <jonathon> charging a battery more slowly will limit temperature rises, but normally charging will adjust as charge increases

[23:06:13] <jonathon> batteries can take higher rates at lower charge levels

[23:06:21] <rakyah> Hmm, I see
[23:06:43] <Foxboron> Edu4rdSHL: I still do not see how this is an error that can happen unless you have done something weird previously with the keyring
[23:06:45] <rakyah> I just dont want to toast this battery too, the other battery only lasted about a year before going down to 50%
[23:07:02] <LinuxMaster1992> I have pretty awful battery life. About 2 hours on a charge.

[23:07:30] <rakyah> :////
[23:08:11] <jonathon> if you used it a lot, or put it into a bag while hot, or stored it in a car, then that will kill the battery. otherwise, it could have been faulty and might be under warranty (12 months doesn't seem like a lot for usable life)
[23:08:27] <HawkinsTheWizard> ok. maybe BIO isnt fixed in mainline.  reverted back to 5.9
[23:08:31] <Edu4rdSHL> Foxboron, I don't do weird things in my main OS, to be honest but it isn't the first time I see it, not happens everytime, not often, but sometimes happens
[23:08:42] <jonathon> HawkinsTheWizard: BIO ?
[23:08:42] <rakyah> Its a 2nd hand laptop, so I cant really speak for how it was handled
[23:08:54] <Foxboron> Edu4rdSHL: I'm still not convinced this is in any way "normal" when you can't explain it
[23:08:54] <rakyah> Ugh idk... maybe Ill give the 65w charger a shot
[23:09:06] <Repentinus> If it's a knockoff battery, 12 months of useful life is pretty good.
[23:09:10] <rakyah> It got fairly hot while charging it just now
[23:09:22] <jonathon> wait... what state was the original battery when you bought it second-hand?
[23:09:36] <jonathon> also, are you using an OEM charger?
[23:09:38] <HawkinsTheWizard> Basic Input Output. seems the problem arises on Radeon on AMD
[23:09:38] <rakyah> Not it was the OEM one, but this ThinkPad in particular got really really bad battery life span
[23:09:54] <Repentinus> Which ThinkPad?
[23:10:06] <rakyah> The battery was at 51% or so when I bought it and I do use the OEM 90w charger jonathon
[23:10:10] <rakyah> x380 Yoga

[23:10:41] <Edu4rdSHL> Foxboron, well, as I said, the error message is that the ID doesn't exists for the key, if that were the problem I shouldn't be able to work with the existing keys for that user before the update and the ID shouldn't exists but it does.
[23:10:48] <Repentinus> Well, if the maximum had reached half the design capacity, that battery was well on its way to the end of its useful life.
[23:10:59] <jonathon> sounds like you're worrying about something that you have no actual basis to worry about
[23:11:01] <Edu4rdSHL> Also, if for example you try to reinstall archlinux-keyring it doesn't happens anymore

[23:11:18] <Foxboron> Edu4rdSHL: that's because nothing downgrades the keyring

[23:11:21] <rakyah> Yes, that is why I replaced it with this new one
[23:11:22] <Foxboron> you need to nuke it and reinstall
[23:11:42] <rakyah> Also Im basing this on other people having had their battery degrade so so much on this ThinkPad, hence my worry
[23:11:52] <Foxboron> downgrading the keyring doesn't actually downgrade it. It tries to apply a bunch of key additions and removals which has already occured
[23:11:54] <rakyah> I do want to keep using this laptop for longer than 2h :(
[23:12:03] <jonathon> rakyah: also worth checking for a BIOS update
[23:12:11] <rakyah> Ooohhh very true
[23:12:57] <Edu4rdSHL> Foxboron, I just said "reinstall" but yes, it's also not reproducible downgrading the keyring.
