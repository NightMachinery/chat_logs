[00:13:57] <mat001> Using asyncio I have a for loop inside async function. And then I await the result. But that runs sequentially! Because of the loop. What would be good ways to run in parallel?

[03:58:24] <Guest56> I have github actions. It's a thingy where once some action happens to github UI (e.g. commit) - it can trigger a remote action on my machine (machine runs github runner daemon that listens to events from github)

[10:32:36] <jinsun> your python and pip may be pointing to different environments (though less likely if you are using os packages only)

[10:36:44] <jinsun> yeah you should use venvs if you are using third party packages

[17:40:07] <anddam> I had an assertion error building a PySide2 wheel with pyenv python 3.9.10 on macOS 12 due to tags not being in packaging.tags.sys_tags(), case in point I had ('cp39', 'cp39', 'macosx_12_0_arm64') whereas supported tags only had up to macosx_10_16_arm64 and macosx_10_16_unversal2
[17:40:26] <white2> CrtxReavr, wdym
[17:40:37] <anddam> this is possibly due to https://github.com/pypa/packaging/issues/497 , odd thing is that using pyenv python 3.8.12 I do see macosx_12_0_arm64 tags in sys_tags()
[17:41:31] <CrtxReavr> white2?
[17:41:49] <anddam> now I went ahead and did the only reasonable thing to do, cheated and called plat_name.replace('12_0', '10_16') at https://github.com/pyside/pyside-setup/blob/dev/build_scripts/wheel_override.py#L172
[17:42:09] <white2> CrtxReavr, what can i do 4 the code pasted?
[17:42:41] <exarkun> anddam: pretty sure macOS does not offer binary compatibility in that direction
[17:42:56] <anddam> so I build the wheel and was able to later install and use it. Question how bad is that? and why cannot I build the wheel with macosx_12_0_arm64 but can then install it without a hiccup when it is tagged macosx_10_16_arm64
[17:42:58] <exarkun> anddam: so the resulting wheel will look like it can be used on 10.16 but there is no reason to expect it can b e
[17:43:01] <anddam> exarkun: what do you mean?
[17:43:13] <anddam> oh ok
[17:43:20] <anddam> I need it to be used on 12 though

[17:44:07] <CrtxReavr> white2, nothing. . . that's the meat & potatoes of my Wordle solver. . . was just sharing it, as others were helping me with it.
[17:44:17] <exarkun> macOS 12 was released October 25, 2021 and Python 3.8.12 was released Aug. 30, 2021
[17:44:21] <anddam> the very odd bit is that packaging.tags.sys_tags() only shows up to 10_16, but the platform.mac_ver() does show "12.0"
[17:44:39] <exarkun> So, your Python has no idea macOS 12 is a thing and doesn't like the wheel tags that are produced on it
[17:45:14] <anddam> exarkun: and I do believe that, but if you read again, it is 3.9 not supporting 12 (in tags at least) whereas 3.8 does have tags for it
[17:45:14] <exarkun> although I guess `packaging` is not stdlib
[17:45:26] * exarkun reads again
[17:45:46] <exarkun> anddam: meanwhile, what version of packaging is installed in each env?
[17:45:49] <anddam> maybe a third pass again, I may have rambled and spread info too much around
[17:45:55] <anddam> good question

[17:48:19] <exarkun> I guess I have no further distinctive insights.  It looks like a bug, I guess.  The same version of packaging on the same host gives different sys tags on py3.8 vs py3.9 - with py3.8 being _more_ inclusive?
[17:48:44] <anddam> because I did not know what tags were at all, apart guessing, I was addressed a couple PEP and now I have a clearer idea of their syntax but no idea about why an interpreter does or does not have a certain tag

[17:49:59] <exarkun> Sure, absent any other factors, you would expect them to support more or less the same tags, apart from the Python version part
[17:50:09] <anddam> I most certainly would, yes
[17:50:37] <exarkun> But I guess there's lots of other factors.  For example, maybe someone noticed that something actually doesn't work on macOS 12 and instead of fixing it they just removed that platform identifier from the sys tags list somehow.

[17:51:11] <exarkun> CPython itself has a C API (and therefore a C ABI) and it changes from time to time.
[17:51:25] <exarkun> So the CPython ABI itself is versioned
[17:51:49] <exarkun> ie, there's no guarantee that an ABI Python 3.8 had will be available or compatible on Python 3.9
[17:52:34] *** Joins: sferofficial (~Thunderbi@120.84.9.83)
[17:52:46] <exarkun> Tangentially, there is a "limited" ABI which is maintained across multiple versions.  If the package you're building restricts itself to that and configures its build system correctly, then you get some "abi3" tag instead, which many versions of CPython can load.
[17:52:47] <anddam> ok, that's basically "reserved wiggle room"

When compiling the extension I get `"_libintl_bind_textdomain_codeset", referenced from: ...`. So apparently I also need to link against libintl. If I add the shared library of libintl I get `"_PyArg_UnpackTuple", referenced from: ...`. I guess there is a trick to link

[19:47:08] <bjs> Adoi: well 0.0000 isn't an integer, maybe you want a float?
[19:47:16] <Adoi> and when I change int to int(float) in order to fix that, I get yet another error
[19:47:25] <bjs> Adoi: what is int(float) ?

[19:47:53] <bjs> Adoi: where is `data` coming from? Maybe you want to fix it at source, so it's not a string containing numbers but rather an actual number
[19:48:19] <exarkun> although carrying floating points around as decimal strings is not necessarily the worst choice
