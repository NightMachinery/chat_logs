My grandmother makes plov in her massive Guardian Service roasting pot, and as far as I can tell, that really is integral to the success of it; I have gotten results *kind of approximating* hers in my German-manufactured (!)

[00:12:23] <two2thehead> Fears about the rise of an uncontrollable super intelligence have been expressed by many people, including the renowned theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking. This theme is also explored in iHuman.
[00:12:23] <two2thehead> However, Horvitz feels it is unlikely to come to fruition. “Even though it’s early days, the things we’re doing today already – and our interest in following the technology as the competency rises and the applications promulgate – will inform us as we go,” he says. “There’s not going to be like a pop where all of a sudden there’s a surprising rise of super intelligence. We’re going to be … learning as we go, and I think we’ll
[00:12:23] <two2thehead>  be careful and wise.”'

[01:59:49] <gwern> I spent one summer breaking up a reinforced concrete patio with a sledgehammer. I imagine it's pretty much the same, and makes e very glad I'm not a peasant or third-worlder
[02:00:05] <quanticle> But all the same, I think it would be better, both for society and for the product managers' characters, for them to dig ditches
[02:01:35] <quanticle> One of my co-workers spent a summer working construction as a worker for his uncle, who owned a road construction construction subcontracting firm. One day, he shows up to the jobsite and his uncle tells him, "Okay, so today you're going to find out why you want to finish college..."
[02:01:55] <quanticle> That was the ditch-digging day
[02:02:33] <quanticle> According to him, the other days were fun, though. He got to drive a bulldozer
[02:02:57] <gwern> there is something to be said for just having a very miserable experience so you always have some perspective. "welp, as bad as working in mcdonald's is, this is still not nearly as bad as that summer breaking concrete"
[02:04:09] <Betawolf> but in mcdonald's they make you talk to people
[02:05:34] <quanticle> gwern, Betawolf: Yeah, brings to mind the anecdote I heard on the radio about the restaurant industry. They were interviewing some former restaurant workers who quit the industry and weren't coming back. They interviewed one worker who was now working at an Amazon warehouse, and he was like, "Well, this work sucks and I took a 20% pay cut, but my shifts are more predictable and I don't have to
[02:05:36] <quanticle> deal with screaming customers."
[02:06:32] <quanticle> This was in the context of, "Why is the restaurant industry having so much trouble staffing up for post-pandemic demand,"
[02:06:46] <quanticle> and the answer turns out to be, "Because restaurant work sucks!"
[02:07:45] <ivan> maybe software can eat these screaming customers

[02:48:17] <quanticle> Obormot\Arcturus: re: "This Job Would Be Great if it Wasn't For the F'N Customers", I wholly agree and that's why I try to maintain stony silence whenever I enter a grocery store, convenience store, gas station, or other retail establishment.
[02:48:25] <Obormot\Arcturus> same
[02:48:54] <quanticle> That said, I don't understand why he finds the "milkmaids" frustrating, unless they don't put the milk back after they're done searching
[02:49:13] <quanticle> Like, they're doing their own thing, if they want to paw through the milk and make a nuisance of themselves, let 'em.
[02:50:08] <quanticle> Far worse, IMO, are the people who come up to you, point out that something is out of stock on the shelf, and ask if you have it "in back"
[02:50:19] <quanticle> As if the stockroom were some kind of draconic hoard
[02:52:26] <saturn2> the whole point of self-service shopping is that you're already IN the back
[02:53:39] <adiabatic> at the local trader joe's sometimes there will be stuff in the back that hasn't come out yet
[02:53:50] <adiabatic> I don't think I've ever asked for stuff in the back, either
[02:54:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> quanticle: Of course they don't put it back
[02:54:15] <Obormot\Arcturus> quanticle: That's the store worker's job!
[02:54:24] <quanticle> I'll admit, I've been that customer once or twice. I have never had someone come back and tell me, "Yep, it was in the back, here you go"
[02:54:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> Well, they wouldn't
[02:54:40] <quanticle> Obormot\Arcturus: Okay, I see, and I have updated to agreement
[02:54:41] <dTal> it definitely happened to me once
[02:54:49] <Obormot\Arcturus> Even if it was in back, they'd tell you it wasn't
[02:54:51] <Obormot\Arcturus> Just to spite you
[02:55:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> Then they'd bring it out and put it on the shelf the minute you walked out the door
[02:56:34] <quanticle> Well, the story I hear is that when a customer asks if it's in the back, you very cheerfully tell them, "Well, let me see!" Then you go into the stockroom, play on your phone for 5 minute (yay break!) and then come out and tell them, "No, sorry 😞 I tried my best, searched high and low, etc, etc, but it looks like we're just plain out of stock. Sorry!"
[02:57:10] <Obormot\Arcturus> I never did that, I just told them no, straight up
[02:57:16] <quanticle> And the product gets restocked on the shelf with the normal rotation just like everything else
[02:57:30] <quanticle> Wow, how did you last in retail?
[02:57:34] <Obormot\Arcturus> 5+ years
[02:57:39] <Obormot\Arcturus> And, how? Easily

[02:58:58] <quanticle> It makes them feel all warm and fuzzy, like they were in the old country again
[02:59:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> You can buy a whole lotta good will if you get people coming in like "oh god my precious Mac is FUCKED and it has ALL MY SHIT ON IT and OH MY GOD HALP" and you're like *magic* and they're like "WOW YOU ARE A WIZARD"

[03:43:33] <Obormot\Arcturus> So I was just having a conversation on my WoW guild's Discord while we were here talking about shitty apps and what have you, and it occurred to me that WoW addons are an example of a class of software that is unusually likely to have exactly the functionality that people want, and no extraneous stuff on top of that, and to almost never get changed into something shittier
[03:43:50] <gwern> (as long as blizzard doesn't sabotage you)

[03:44:15] <RiversHaveWings> gwern: wait what
[03:44:37] <RiversHaveWings> Does that thing work
[03:44:42] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: Right, and that's the thing, isn't it? It's only an external factor that can force changes for the worse. (And it doesn't even do that very often!)
[03:44:53] <gwern> RiversHaveWings: I really doubt it, but you can send them $100 to sequence your microbiome at home lol, maybe
[03:45:15] <RiversHaveWings> I mean the network morphism paper
[03:45:43] <gwern> RiversHaveWings: oh. sure, it works. OA implemented hacky versions for doing 'model surgery' back when they still did stuff like OA5
[03:45:44] <Obormot\Arcturus> Like, one dude in my guild asked how to do something and I was like "just install <name of addon>, it does this perfectly and seamlessly"

[03:46:27] <quanticle> I thought the latest analysis showed a small bias in favor of white?
[03:46:33] <gwern> why wouldn't it? plenty of ways to edit models in place once you figure out what is an identity transform or at least distribution-preserving
[03:46:42] <gwern> quanticle: that's empirical, not theoretical
[03:46:47] <quanticle> Ah, okay.
[03:46:48] <RiversHaveWings> I've considered before stuff like doubling the number of channels in a convnet
[03:46:57] <gwern> quanticle: there can't be a 'small bias', because perfect play is deterministic and unique
[03:47:01] <quanticle> So they want a mathematical proof of optimal play leading to a win for white.
[03:47:02] <RiversHaveWings> In a way that preserves the mapping it has learned
[03:47:06] <gwern> (well, maybe not unique)
[03:47:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> And then I reflected on what I'd just said... I mean, was I exaggerating? Did my praise elide any problems or caveats? And... no, it actually is just like I said. This addon does one specific (very commonly useful) thing, automatically, with no configuration needed, with no thinking needed, and with no flaws.
[03:47:12] <RiversHaveWings> Then adding small random perturbations and fine-tuning
[03:47:18] <gwern> quanticle: so either white always wins, always ties, or always loses
[03:47:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> And ... is the author going to suddenly update it to add some dumb shit? Very unlikely. Why would he? What's in it for him?
[03:48:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> There's every reason to expect that this addon will just continue flawlessly doing the thing it does, forever.
[03:48:21] <quanticle> Until the next WoW patch breaks it
[03:48:44] <Obormot\Arcturus> Well, this is Classic, remember? It's the old API, with minimal changes.
[03:48:50] <gwern> RiversHaveWings: yes, that sort of thing is entirely possible. like fading in layers in ProGAN. it may not be possible in every case or easy to figure out, but that's why you put the knowledge into a library so you can say 'next iteration, give me an additional 10 channels which are initialized to identity using rezero gates or smth'
[03:49:10] <quanticle> gwern: I wonder if such a thing is even tractable to compute. As I recall from the chatter around checkers being proven, that stretched the limits of computational capacity.
[03:49:45] <gwern> quanticle: well, who knows? it's math, so it depends on clever ideas more than theory. some idea like 'strategy-stealing' goes a lot further than moore's law
[03:49:45] <quanticle> Obormot\Arcturus: Ah, fair enough. Maybe we need a MacOS Classic™
[03:49:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> quanticle: And there's always updates. One of my friends wrote an addon for WoW, back in ~2005. He has maintained it since. It has continue to function (with the occasional API-update-compensating fix) through all versions of the game since.
[03:50:31] <Obormot\Arcturus> It does one specific thing and that is all. It does that thing perfectly (pretty much all UX bugs and such long since found and fixed).
[03:50:34] <quanticle> Yeah, maybe we'll get some theoretical breakthrough that conquers chess.
[03:50:56] <Obormot\Arcturus> So, you know, it's possible to have this sort of ecosystem.
[03:51:04] <Obormot\Arcturus> You just need the right set of incentives.
[03:51:43] <Obormot\Arcturus> Browser addons would be largely like this if not for vendors deliberately breaking shit, I will point out!
[03:51:50] <quanticle> Obormot\Arcturus: I mean, the good browser add-ons are like that too. When was the last time AlwaysKillSticky received a UI update? (It was when I submitted the patch to hide the killed stickies count, and you fixed its visual look)
[03:52:02] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yeah
[03:52:05] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: sounds more like it also lacks a lot of 'bitcreep' factors. these extensions are generally siloed from each other and doing specific things using standards
[03:52:13] <quanticle> uBlock Origin, likewise
[03:52:30] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: Ehh, WoW addons can absolutely interact with each other, and do

[06:21:32] <ggreer> he also has some steps that he does for going faster in manufacturing:
[06:21:42] <ggreer> step 1: make the requirements less dumb
[06:21:42] <ggreer> step 2: delete the part or process
[06:21:42] <ggreer> step 3: simplify or optimize the part/process "the most common error of a smart engineer is to optimize a thing that should not exist"
[06:21:42] <ggreer> step 4: accelerate cycle time
[06:21:42] <ggreer> step 4: automate
[06:22:05] <ggreer> and then he tells a tale of how he did those steps in the exact opposite order for the model 3
[06:22:13] <ggreer> "literally I automated, accelerated, simplified, and then deleted"
[06:22:50] <ggreer> apparently there were some fibergrass mats on top of the model 3 battery pack (between the pack and the frame), and a bottleneck on the assembly line was gluing the mats to the battery pack
[06:22:50] <ggreer> so they optimized the robot arm paths to glue faster, then figured they didn't need as much glue (since it just had to stay on the pack until it was mounted in the frame)
[06:22:50] <ggreer> the battery pack people said the mat was for sound insulation and wasn't needed for fire protection. the frame people said the mat was for fire protection
[06:22:50] <ggreer> so they made a couple model 3s without the mat, tested sound and.... it was the same. so they deleted the part

[08:24:48] <quanticle> saturn2: Somehow they thought there would be enough satellites to launch, and enough satellite servicing to do that it would be profitable. Remember, the original launch schedule for the STS was like, twice a month
[08:24:57] <quanticle> Instead of, as it turned out, like twice a year
[08:25:04] <saturn2> oh i see
[08:25:06] <gwern> quanticle: it reports 0.9x a ton in my logs
[08:25:17] <saturn2> well sure
[08:25:41] <saturn2> when did they discover that that wasn't going to happen, and why didn't they cancel the program at that time?
[08:25:56] <quanticle> Even in 1985, they were holding "60 flights a year" as a goal
[08:26:00] <quanticle> Which is... hilarious
[08:26:18] <quanticle> I'm not even sure the Falcon 9 does 60 flights a year
[08:27:10] <nshepperd2> https://irc.zlkj.in/uploads/e1ec3388f4fd3da5/20210809035633_0_neg_art.png the opposite of art is these molluscs on the seafloor
[08:27:11] <Robomot> image/png (256x256; 147 KB)
[08:27:39] <saturn2> i don't think they intentionally set out to make a boondoggle, but the funding did not cease once it became clear that it was a boondoggle
[08:28:16] <quanticle> Oh, yeah, I don't know about that. That is actually beyond the scope of the book, because the book *ends* with the Challenger explosion
[08:28:33] <quanticle> And the real boondoggleness of the Shuttle only becomes apparent after that disaster
[08:29:14] <quanticle> When people start taking a hard look at the design of the Shuttle and realize, hey, wait a minute, there is no way you'll be able to refurbish one quickly enough to get it back up in space in a week's time, now matter how much money you spend.
[08:29:27] <gwern> nshepperd2: "I should've been a pair of ragged mollusks scuttling across the sea" eh
[08:29:59] <nshepperd2> "going to art school was a mistake"
[08:30:44] <quanticle> But also, by that point, the Soviet Union is also almost dead. And remember the Shuttle keeps getting funding all through the '90s and into the 2000s, long after the death of the Soviet Union. So even if we take it as a given that "bankrupting the Russkies" was a goal of the Shuttle, your question still holds; just from a later date.
[08:31:19] <quanticle> Instead of, "Why didn't we cancel the Shuttle in '86," it becomes, "Why didn't we cancel the Shuttle in '92?"
[08:32:33] <saturn2> well, the logic of the cold war is so embedded in american institutions that it's impossible to stop fighting it, even without an enemy :)
[08:32:58] <quanticle> My take is that, at that point, the US is already too invested in the ISS. It's like a boondoggle flywheel. You need the Space Shuttle to build the ISS, and you need the ISS because the Space Shuttle needs something to build.
[08:36:44] <quanticle> Speaking of which, there was this amusing exchange on... one of the podcasts I listen to (I forget which): "Man, why does NASA keep cooperating with the Russians on the ISS, even though it's clear at this point that Roskosmos is no longer capable of actually producing safe space systems?" "Because if NASA took over the ISS completely, it would no longer be the *International* Space Station, it'd
[08:36:47] <quanticle> be the *American* Space Station, and nobody wants that acronym."
[08:40:00] <saturn2> they could just keep pasting more and more canadarms onto it
[08:40:23] <saturn2> international space centipede
[08:44:41] <quanticle> saturn2: So *thats* where that one boss in R-Type came from
[08:45:30] <quanticle> The International Space Centipede gained self-awareness, looked at itself, and was immediately disgusted and horrified at humanity
[08:45:34] <quanticle> ... and swore revenge
[08:51:12] <quanticle> Yeah, to recap, the reason anyone thought that the Shuttle would be profitable is because NASA quoted 60 flights a year, with a payload of 65,000 pounds per flight, at a cost of $100 per pounds. And the way they sold this was that they commissioned this Mathematica report. And what Mathematica did was go around to all the contractors who would be responsible for building the Space Shuttle and
[08:51:14] <quanticle> asked them, "So this thing that you're building, can it do 60 flights a year, 65,000 pounds per flight and $100 per pound?" And all the contractors, fully cognizant that their extremely cushy NASA paychecks were riding on the answer to this survey, answered, "Yep, sure can"
[08:51:49] <quanticle> And for the record, 65,000 pounds is roughly 10% more than the payload capacity of a Falcon Heavy
[08:52:04] <quanticle> Oh wait, not Falcon Heavy, Falcon 9
[08:52:11] <quanticle> I misread the numbers on the Heavy
[08:53:20] <quanticle> tl;dr: the way we make the space program not suck is send Elon Musk back in time to 1970
[08:54:23] <PapuaHardyNet> quanticle: you should write more horror stories
[08:55:34] <quanticle> lol
[08:56:54] <quanticle> Actually that's a fun scenario: you're a self-aware ISS. You have... a Soyuz capsule, and a bunch of Canadarms
[08:56:59] <quanticle> How do you take over the world?
[08:57:12] <quanticle> s/self-aware/superintelligent/
[08:57:53] <quanticle> Assume that NASA and the Russians think you're a derelict and have shut off their downlinks
[08:58:11] <quanticle> (This prevents the easy option which is, "lol just hack NASA")
[08:59:47] <quanticle> Also note: you're the biggest fucking thing in low-earth orbit and you're the precise opposite of stealthy
[09:01:16] <quanticle> (AI box challenge: hard mode)
[09:04:03] <PapuaHardyNet> oh yes, that sounds like a good challenge
[09:05:44] <quanticle> I guess the easy mode option is still there, if you can start hacking, say, Starlink satellites
[09:07:13] <PapuaHardyNet> the idea makes for a viable roguelike strategy game tbh
[09:07:30] <PapuaHardyNet> think Plague Inc + XCOM
[09:08:11] <Ralith> isn't it pretty easy to listen in on ISS transmissions
[09:08:14] <quanticle> Start hacking satellites and try to make it down to Earth before the Americans, Chinese or Russians notice and blow you out of the sky with their ASAT rockets?
[09:08:39] <Ralith> why would their first response be so destructive
[09:08:59] <quanticle> Well, if they've figured out that you're a hostile AI...
[09:09:06] <Ralith> why would they have figured that out
[09:09:58] <Ralith> really seems like all you'd have to do is be noticeably mysterious until enough instruments get pointed your way
[09:17:56] <PapuaHardyNet> you don't have to be noticably mysterious: we are talking about superintelligent AI here
[09:18:07] <PapuaHardyNet> they should have some semblance of deception and strategy in their arsenal

[11:55:53] <Urchin[emacs]> I've read the Challenger Launch Decision
[11:56:13] <quanticle> Oh, cool
[11:56:18] <Urchin[emacs]> it doesn't really frame Feynman's arguments correctly
[11:56:29] <feep[work]> bunch of stuff in here that I didn't know, like the mathematica study
[11:57:33] <feep[work]> quanticle: two missing things that I think were cool, but that I don't know if they were in the book
[11:57:44] <Urchin[emacs]> the author also concludes that everything was fine because the technical culture funcitoned as it was sett up, but Feynman has unfucked dysfunctional technical cultures before, and he would not find the technical culture as a given and imutable
[11:58:07] <quanticle> Yeah, finding that Mathematica study was... a pain
[11:58:10] <feep[work]> first of all, how the whole design is driven by the requirement to deploy and retrieve a satellite in the same mission
[11:58:13] <quanticle> But it was so satisfying when I found it
[11:58:18] <feep[work]> a requirement that was never actually needed
[11:58:47] <quanticle> feep[work]: I literally used that example 
[11:58:50] <quanticle> In an argument with a PM
[11:58:54] <feep[work]> didn't see it in the text?
[11:59:02] <quanticle> Oh, it's at the bottom
[11:59:06] <quanticle> In the "references" section
[11:59:09] <feep[work]> oic
[11:59:16] <feep[work]> anyway, the second, as musk recently pointed out, how the shuttle could never iterate on its design because every launch was a manned launch
[11:59:28] <Urchin[emacs]> and the author also points towards normalization of deviation (or whatever it's called exactly) without mentioning that it's something that Feynman himself wrote about, though mostly in the context of main engines, which he spent the most time studying (and noting only software as the exception to the suck)
[11:59:51] <feep[work]> which seems obvious once you say it, but it's obvious from a spacex perspective of rapid iteration with cheap hardware
[12:00:03] <quanticle> I mean, even setting that aside, the fact that the Shuttle took so long to refurbish meant that that even if they did unmanned launches, their iteration rate would have been way too low
[12:00:21] <Urchin[emacs]> feep[work]: specifically, requirement to retrieve camera film from a satellite, which was obsolete by the time of launch
[12:00:26] <quanticle> Like, SpaceX launches 4 rockets in the time it would take NASA to get the SRBs back to Morton Thiokol
[12:00:26] <feep[work]> sure, the design was crippled, but any notion of improvement was also crippled by the operational approach on top of that
[12:01:40] <quanticle> Okay, now I'm motivated to actually finish my (re)read of Challenger Launch Decision, because I know I'll have someone to talk to about it
[12:07:02] <feep[work]> I mean, I think you're underestimating the value of throwaway launches. like, part of it is surely cost plus contracting
[12:07:07] <feep[work]> but it's not like ... like ... uh
[12:07:39] <feep[work]> first, it's impossible to say that spacex is the secret sauce, when all the corporations that have sprung up in the sector are *marked* by government funding and the attendant pressures
[12:08:08] <feep[work]> like, I think the thing with spacex is that musk is doing the bezos thing of imposing a way of thinking from the top and just pushing, pushing, pushing on it
[12:09:08] <feep[work]> I cannot imagine a spacex that sat on its established technology, it would seem like a waste of engineers, but I think part of that is just that musk has set a really high goal with attainable steps, ie. a moonshot
[12:09:57] <feep[work]> I think there's just a fundamental difference between a program that has one lofty goal and a program that has five sorta doable goals

[13:13:39] <Urchin[emacs]> they had crazy goals for Falcon
[13:13:43] <Urchin[emacs]> but that was ages ago
[13:14:00] <Urchin[emacs]> Falcon 9 flopped, compared to what Elon Musk wanted
[13:16:48] <feep[work]> that's fair to say yeah
[13:17:01] <feep[work]> well, sorta?
[13:17:12] <feep[work]> Urchin[emacs]: I think it's less that falcon 9 failed as that a lot of goals got rolled forward into starship
[13:19:42] <Urchin[emacs]> feep[work]: on one hand, yes, on the other, that just sounds like an excuse
[13:21:33] <feep[work]> I mean, it's always been how elon works
[13:21:54] <feep[work]> like, if you judge elon by his goals, his career is characterized by an unending string of failures and excuses
[13:22:13] <feep[work]> whereas if you ignore the shit he promises and just look what he achieves, he's been astonishingly successful
[13:24:08] <feep[work]> Urchin[emacs]: that said, I still think it doesn't make sense to view like ... falcon as a flop even relative to elon's goals.
[13:24:39] <feep[work]> because starship as a product is coming out of the same production process, the same program so to say, as falcon 9 is
[13:25:57] <feep[work]> the only reason it's not called falcon 33 is that that wouldn't make any technological sense because so much was changed, but it seems hard to hold that ... like, "falcon 9 has failed because we had to reengineer the whole stack to achieve what we wanted", seems like a weird way to put it
[13:26:08] <feep[work]> elon was never *committed* to any particular rocket.
[13:26:47] <feep[work]> I don't think he was ever like, "we will achieve these goals with an iterative design process on the falcon 9 or bust"
[13:28:03] <feep[work]> elon has a stack of crazy goals. f9 has fulfilled some of them, more than I think most people expected. starship will fulfill more, or if it doesn't, the next rocket will.

[14:58:39] <feep[work]> why does "OOP is not about inheritance" only have 7 hits when it's obviously true :(
[14:59:31] <Gurkenglas> well what is about inheritance
[14:59:41] <feep[work]> nothing cause nobody needs it lol
[15:00:55] <feep[work]> an inherited method is indistinguishable from either a free function that takes the superclass, or a class that contains the current one.
[15:01:29] <feep[work]> it's a useless design shortcut.
[15:03:26] <nshepperd2> imo OOP is about inheritance and that's why it sucks
[15:03:41] <feep[work]> I agree that inasmuch as oop is about inheritance, it sucks.
[15:03:53] <nshepperd2> take out the inheritance and it's just a fancy syntax for calling associated functions, which i'd just call Object Programming
[15:04:05] <feep[work]> eh, that's not how we use it at [work]
[15:04:18] <feep[work]> I think the thing we're doing is more Object Oriented Design
[15:04:35] <feep[work]> our actual programming is p much all functional
[15:05:21] <feep[work]> OOD has the characteristics of flat inheritance hierarchies (usually only one deep), almost always of the form class <|-- interface
[15:05:35] <feep[work]> classes are used to control process state changes in response to commands 
[15:06:16] <feep[work]> designing processes this way also allows mock testing
[15:06:54] <feep[work]> but the main goal is to keep dependency flows non-circular with dependency injection
[15:07:14] <feep[work]> this makes the core of the process more readable by breaking the dependence on the io layer
[15:07:55] <feep[work]> and unittesting can speak in terms of the business domain, whether you're reading or writing
[15:08:44] <feep[work]> effectively the core logic can be expressed in terms of "is called by I, calls O", and the part between I and O can be cut out and cleanly tested

[17:30:22] *** Joins: PapuaHardyNet (apotheosis@tilde.institute)
[17:30:39] <PapuaHardyNet> ouch, I missed a few hours of #lw
[17:30:49] <pompolic> permission to speculate on enlightenment? i suspect i might be able to present a very tiny cake
[17:34:00] <dbohdan> Sure?
[17:36:41] <pompolic> so, from before: human brains can lie to the user. humans are also a social species and navigating the world by social proof is a good energy-saving strategy
[17:36:56] <pompolic> this, plus social bubbles produce these quasi-religious microcosms
[17:37:15] <pompolic> which are, i think, the default form of existence for people
[17:38:03] <dbohdan2> I am with you so far
[17:38:16] <pompolic> there are people who either understand how to author these microcosms, or just learned a set of strategies to leverage them (c.f. "narcissists", but i'm using this as a landmark to denote the cluster in thingspace)
[17:38:57] <dbohdan2> (Chapman would call them "geniuses" :-))
[17:39:17] <pompolic> enlightenment, then seems to be, a shitty bag of tricks that allows one to factor out the influence of these bubbles, or factor out manipulation/undue influence from said "narcissists"
[17:39:53] <pompolic> i think what people get wrong is that uhhh
[17:40:13] <pompolic> even if they "peek behind the curtain" or whatever, their rationality remains bounded
[17:40:27] <nshepperd2>  i get the impression that it mostly increases the influence of narcissists. what with all the gurus and what have you
[17:40:32] <pompolic> so they can just self-confidently walk into another quasi-religious microcosm
[17:40:34] <dbohdan2> Hmm.  This doesn't match how I imagine enlightenment.
[17:40:50] <feep[work]> it *sorta* does, but it seems like it misses the way it actually works
[17:41:01] <pompolic> nshepperd2: yeah, i think some people just jump to "and so I should start a cult"
[17:41:24] <pompolic> i think i don't have a gears-level understanding of it yet
[17:41:47] <pompolic> this is a low-resolution shitpost understanding
[17:42:25] <pompolic> speaking of "and so I should start a cult", well
[17:42:30] <pompolic> sinceriously was an interesting read
[17:42:39] <dbohdan2> So, in the end, they are not so different from the narcissists?  They free themselves from slavery only to become slaveowners?
[17:42:52] <pompolic> i think it is an easy mistake to make
[17:43:24] <pompolic> personally, i feel like due to being raised by insane people, i reverse engineered their toolkit just by paying attention and knowing some game theory
[17:43:41] <pompolic> it is very important to *not* deploy it, IMO
[17:43:58] <pompolic> downloading the narc moveset
[17:44:36] <pompolic> but again, to avoid confusion, this "narcissism" is not necessarily the psychiatric definition of narcissism
[17:44:57] <dbohdan2> Right, right
[17:45:01] <pompolic> for example i know that one particular person i had to deal with just had untreated PTSD and paranoid tendencies
[17:45:34] <pompolic> that's all, thanks for bearing with me

[17:59:44] <vrs> I wish people would stop linking the geeks/mops/sociopaths post uncritically
[18:00:17] <vrs> it's a good model from a community member perspective and pretty wrong from a community perspective
[18:00:28] <dbohdan2> What do you mean?
[18:00:33] <vrs> it traces the path of a member through a community, not the lifecycle of a community
[18:00:45] <vrs> but too many people conflate the two
[18:01:12] <pompolic> well, it seems to explicitly talk about the lifecycle of a community, but it's been a while since i read it
[18:01:12] <vrs> whoever joins the community after you is almost by definition a mop
[18:01:19] <pompolic> ooh
[18:01:42] <dbohdan2> It does make a claim about the lifecycle of communities
[18:01:49] <vrs> yeah it's demonstrably wrong
[18:01:57] <vrs> example imageboards
[18:02:10] <vrs> those have gone through several generations of posters and are still kicking
[18:02:55] <vrs> but you only see those things if you take the community perspective, not the member perspective
[18:03:35] <pompolic> i think i get you now
[18:03:47] <pompolic> how the lifecycle of a community looks to a member
[18:04:41] <dbohdan2> Okay, I understand
[18:04:48] *** Joins: Dyo (~Dyo@host.sedf.de)
[18:05:32] <pompolic> dbohdan2: i'm unclear on the distinction between "geek" and "genius". i went for "genius" because i felt "geek" connoted lack of self-awareness, whereas my experience has been characterized by "i didn't ask for all this self-awareness foisted on me but i'll just use it for my purposes then"
[18:06:02] <pompolic> my purposes as in doing geeky things i guess
[18:06:32] <dbohdan2> pompolic: 'Unless some of the creators are geniuses. If they can give the New Thing genuine mass appeal, they can ascend into superstardom. The subculture will reorganize around them, into a much more durable form. I won’t go into that in there. I will point out that this almost never happens without sociopaths. An ambitious creator may know they have mass-appeal genius, and could be a star, but very
[18:06:34] <dbohdan2> rarely do they know how to get from here to there.'
[18:08:03] <pompolic> oh, thanks

[18:11:24] <dbohdan2> vrs: So, is your disagreement with Chapman's essay that you think most communities do not actually follow this lifecycle, they just seem to to a member?

[18:12:45] <vrs> or it was the last times I checked
[18:13:30] <vrs> though in 2010, the better place for OC was the alternative chans, not 4chan
[18:13:55] <dbohdan2> vrs: This is something GMS predicts
[18:14:15] <dbohdan2> The question is not if OC is alive at all, is it?  It is about the average user.
[18:14:24] <vrs> GMS mispredicts community lifecycles
[18:14:28] <pompolic> superz: i think that post nails what i dislike about zen, or perhaps mainstream buddhists
[18:15:03] <vrs> but you only really notice if you stay in a community for longer than is healthy
[18:15:12] <pompolic> i style myself as a reverse engineer, so they can miss me with that "this can't be explained, only demonstrated" meme
[18:15:34] <dbohdan2> I stayed on imageboards for longer than it's healthy :-)
[18:15:36] <vrs> you see an active community but they're all people you don't really know, everyone you do know has moved on and you're a living fossil
[18:15:46] <feep[work]> why could zen not be demonstrated?
[18:15:47] <pompolic> vrs: lol that sounds both a self-roast and accurate

[18:16:12] <pompolic> feep[work]: that's what i wanted to know and they wouldn't explain

[18:16:32] <vrs> pompolic: it happened to me! the place died to external interference and that's how I left
[18:16:33] <pompolic> i don't think i was talking to competent buddhists, just low-tier wannabes
[18:16:46] <feep[work]> pompolic: charitably, it's that zen is a set of techniques without much epistemology
[18:16:54] <pompolic> i think that's spot on
[18:17:19] <feep[work]> okay this tea is definitely undrinkable. begh.
[18:17:41] <vrs> the community itself reformed elsewhere and I occasionally check on it, but I have no real attachment anymore
[18:18:16] <pompolic> but i mean the whole "koan" thing, fun as it is, seems like something you do in lieu of understanding how people know things
[18:18:26] <pompolic> s/but i/i/
[18:18:46] <feep[work]> no that makes sense, I think scott's explanation is basically spot on
[18:19:07] <feep[work]> there are positions you cannot argue a person out of or into because they're acquired by pattern recognition first and foremost
[18:19:26] <pompolic> vrs: similar things happened to me too
[18:19:27] <dbohdan2> vrs: Yes, that is something that happens (becoming a living fossil).  I guess I don't quite understand why you think this means GMS is wrong.
[18:19:34] <pompolic> i guess i specialize in koan't
[18:19:36] <feep[work]> that does not mean they're *wrong* but it means they're not easily amenable to introspection
[18:19:52] <pompolic> there is this experience and _by god i will explain it_
[18:20:10] <feep[work]> you can explain enlightenment
[18:20:17] <feep[work]> you just cannot induce it in others by explaining it
[18:20:46] <feep[work]> it's like I cannot explain why I believe in patternism and mathematical universe
[18:20:47] <pompolic> i would offer proof by construction but that would be severely unethical and i'm not all that confident in my ability to do so
[18:21:04] <pompolic> i think it's why they have gurus and whatnot
[18:21:13] <feep[work]> I mean, I can explain why I have *come* to that belief, I guess it's more that I cannot *justify* why I hold it
[18:21:20] <pompolic> they can just bayesian update you into enlightenment or something
[18:21:24] <feep[work]> lol
[18:21:51] <vrs> dbohdan2: because people writing goodbye posts about how the community had sold out were a constant
[18:22:09] <pompolic> fwiw, last year i read The Fabric of Reality by David Deutsch and i loved it
[18:22:19] <vrs> for all the ten years I stayed with the wider community
[18:22:22] <pompolic> it's basically There Are No Inherently Mysterious Phenomena: The Book
[18:22:56] <pompolic> that must be like how people post "dead game" on every eve patchnote
[18:23:40] <feep[work]> I don't think the argument is that enlightenment is mysterious
[18:23:42] <dbohdan2> vrs: Okay.  Did the community "sell out" or become more mainstream relative to its early days and its founders' values?
[18:23:56] <feep[work]> unexplainable and mysterious are not the same thing at all.
[18:24:18] <feep[work]> for instance, sensory data is unexplainable and utterly without mystery
[18:24:36] <feep[work]> qualia are well explainable, you just allocate a label and associate it with inputs
[18:24:43] <vrs> dbohdan2: no
[18:24:46] <feep[work]> but the human brain simply does not have an "allocate a label" operation
[18:24:55] <pompolic> oooh
[18:25:06] <pompolic> isn't that just basically making up a temporary shitpost ontology
[18:25:09] <dbohdan2> vrs: Then I agree, that contradicts GMS

[18:25:39] <pompolic> yeah
[18:25:40] <vrs> to me it's just, people enter a community, become senior, exit eventually
[18:25:53] <pompolic> it feels like kind of what I've been up to for a good while now
[18:26:01] <momus> o/
[18:26:05] <pompolic> i can do some neat stuff with intuitive reasoning
[18:26:09] <dbohdan2> I see.  IME, most communities do become more mainstream relative to how they are early on.
[18:26:12] <feep[work]> I mean for the record, what I did for my sense of self is ... like, I had to sorta break my perception of identity before I could properly become a patternist
[18:26:17] <feep[work]> and the way I did that wasn't really a logical operation
[18:26:20] <pompolic> i can also do different neat stuff with explicit reasoning
[18:26:25] <pompolic> i'm learning to connect the two \o/
[18:26:29] <feep[work]> \o/
[18:26:53] <feep[work]> but yeah exactly, I think it's basically down to doing percussive maintenance on system 1
[18:27:12] <pompolic> be kind to animals
[18:27:19] <feep[work]> pompolic: the thing is, for most people system1 reasoning *precedes* system 2.
[18:27:33] <pompolic> yes
[18:27:36] <feep[work]> so enlightenment has to happen as a traumatic event first
[18:27:42] <pompolic> possibly
[18:27:53] <pompolic> i wonder if system 1 can, in theory, do metacognition
[18:28:03] <pompolic> it would look like a cognitive reflex
[18:28:16] <feep[work]> I think it can, but not autonomously
[18:28:31] <vrs> if anything, there perennial communities and not-so-perennial ones
[18:28:35] <feep[work]> like, probably system2 can train it to. but I don't think the brain would do that.

[18:29:08] <vrs> perennial communities have multiple generations of members and may live for decades, especially if they figure out how to induct their own children

[18:29:23] <vrs> others burn out when the first generation of founders leave
[18:29:25] <feep[work]> "consciousness is a differential equation" has no google hits
[18:29:57] <feep[work]> neither does "consciousness is a fourier transform" :sadface:
[18:30:40] <feep[work]> neither does, somehow, "consciousness is a digest"; I genuinely thought that one would have hits
[18:30:42] <dbohdan2> vrs: This is a good distinction!  Someone should write this up as an alternative to/update on GMS.
[18:31:19] <dbohdan2> feep[work]: I think you have explained patternism pretty convincingly on multiple occasions, actually.  Evidence: it has increased my belief in patternism.
[18:31:29] <feep[work]> dbohdan2: right, I mean, thank you :)
[18:31:43] <feep[work]> dbohdan2: but like... I mean, the *way* that I became a patternist isn't that someone explained it to me really well
[18:32:23] <feep[work]> it's that someone explained it to me, and then I was like, "that is obviously correct but it feels terribly wrong" and then I sort of wore those two facts against one another until my natural ontology of self cracked under the strain
[18:32:35] <vrs> I did write a rebuttal to GMS a few years ago, but I don't think I've incorporated the perennial/annual distinction yet
[18:33:12] <pompolic> man
[18:33:16] <feep[work]> dbohdan2: basically, ontology of self is such a deeply felt and reinforced fact that your brain walks around with something like confidence=0.99999 in it

[18:33:57] <feep[work]> and you need to disagree with that for a long time and in lots of different ways, and you need to have a replacement theory already at hand, to get that confidence low enough that your brain can transition
[18:33:57] <kuudes> isn't one of the effects of meditation to weaken that prior about self existing?
[18:34:00] <pompolic> "consciousness fourier transform" is like
[18:34:00] <vrs> I was angrier then than I am now
[18:34:16] <feep[work]> kuudes: I mean, that fits with my model of "meditation is basically slow lsd"
[18:34:17] <pompolic> "academic papers that look like shitposts" material
[18:34:40] <kuudes> consciousness fourier transform is a calendar?

[18:36:16] <pompolic> "meditation is basically slow lsd" :D
[18:36:32] <feep[work]> I mean, cause recall the scott post about lsd weakening instinctive priors

[19:12:41] <PapuaHardyNet> makes sense

[19:18:16] <two2thehead> "Here's the real news: there is growing evidence that -- for whatever reason (higher viral loads, something different about how the virus is handled by less mature immune systems, or something else), children infected by the Delta variant may develop a more severe form of the disease compared to illness caused by other forms of the virus. 
[19:18:16] <two2thehead> In a recent NPR interview, Dr. Rick Barr, who leads the Arkansas Children's Hospital, said that the "Delta variant is acting very, very differently with respect to kids ... just in the month of July, we have [admitted] over 40 to the children's hospital. .. and a number of those have ended up in the intensive care unit.""

Due to the in situ permutation that flashsort performs in its...
[19:19:44] <gwern> ...classification process, flashsort is not stable. If stability is required, it is possible to use a second array so elements can be classified sequentially. However, in this case, the algorithm will require O(n) additional memory.' hm

[23:25:23] <RiversHaveWings> "Maybe I am way out of the loop but is it even possible to know html and not be able to understand CSS?" He said "read HTML", not "know HTML"
[23:25:27] <ggreer> https://starlinerupdates.com/boeing-advances-starliner-solutions-in-the-vertical-integration-facility/ wow they got 7 of the 13 valves working
[23:25:28] <Robomot> Boeing Advances Starliner Solutions in the Vertical Integration Facility
[23:25:51] <mst> galambo: look at your /msg window please
[23:25:56] <feep> mst: I was reading around this twitter thread
[23:26:03] <feep> and I genuinely got angry for like half a minute?
[23:26:13] <feep> now I'm just amazed
[23:26:26] <mst> feep: I noticed OP's bio said he was an academic philosopher so took the entire thing as comedy
[23:26:33] <feep> I mean
[23:27:01] <feep> it's like a snapshot of ... like, the amount of people responding actually ... it's like
[23:27:06] <feep> if you see one bad take, it's like ugh
[23:27:10] <feep> if you see 20 identical bad takes
[23:27:11] <gwern> it's very pure and distilled sneerclub
[23:27:27] <feep> yeah I just went "oh hang on my apologies, this is just the bad takes area, carry on"
[23:29:42] <mst> right, I considered dunking on some of them but then decided that would probably be ableism
[23:30:31] <feep> part of the problem with the internet is its topology
[23:30:57] <feep> links connect vastly disparate regions instantly
[23:31:09] <feep> and it can be hard to identify where you are coming out
[23:32:48] <mst> like I say, the bio was my clue
[23:32:59] <mst> also the people he @ed in downthread
[23:33:26] <mst> if you deliberately summon @idirienne, I know this is twat country
[23:33:42] <feep> dgerard too

[23:34:51] <shawwwn> Huh, apparently subsim2interactive is using a different model https://www.reddit.com/r/SubSimulatorGPT2Meta/comments/p0mgf8/didnt_know_they_were_a_conspiracy_theorist/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf
[23:34:56] <shawwwn> Since it’s talking about covid
[23:35:03] <feepbot> Didn't know they were a conspiracy theorist : SubSimulatorGPT2Meta (250 votes and 3 comments so far on Reddit)
[23:35:39] <shawwwn> Wonder who trained it
[23:36:33] <shawwwn> Oh, I guess people prompted it about covid
[23:36:42] <mst> feep: she, specifically, is at least as ridiculous as he is and *far* dumber
[23:37:00] <gwern> shawwwn: yeah, it looks like it's copying from the prompting. phones don't 'emit' covid, nor is covid a 'drug'
[23:37:23] <gwern> (but as a random new named entity mentioned in a prompt, those are reasonable guesses)
[23:37:32] <shawwwn> Ye
[23:37:47] <gwern> semi-surprised he hasn't upgraded to gpt-j yet
[23:38:23] <galambo> I posted this on 27 february 2020: listen man I thought bitcoin was hot shit back in 2013. and I sold my stocks a week before "the worst week since financial crisis"
[23:39:37] <gwern> how much did you earn from the bitcoin you bought in 2013?
[23:40:27] <gwern> (btc ended 2013 at $757, to help jog your memory)
[23:40:39] *** Joins: Urchin[emacs] (~user@user/urchin)
[23:40:49] <galambo> gwern, well you see I was very poor back then
[23:41:12] <galambo> I was actually mostly mining litecoin at the time
[23:41:55] <galambo> I bought some bitcoin with cash I took from my parents. I did a lot of research trying to figure out how to convert egyptian pounds into bitcoin
[23:42:15] <galambo> I think I lost like 30% in the process
[23:43:31] <kuudes> nice
[23:44:37] <galambo> I have a weird obsession with finance and it is going to bite me in the ass
[23:46:05] <two2thehead> top four cryptocurrencies by rank : {Bitcoin BTC $46,208.65
[23:46:05] <two2thehead> Ethereum ETH $3,166.07
[23:46:05] <two2thehead> Tether USDT $1.00
[23:46:05] <two2thehead> Binance Coin BNB $355.56}
[23:46:43] <two2thehead> kuudes, any idea how they did the ranking? It's not by price. If so Tether wouldn't be so high
[23:46:51] <galambo> market cap?
[23:47:15] <two2thehead> well, I'll be darned. You're right
[23:47:17] <two2thehead> galambo, +1
[23:47:22] <kuudes> galambo, gwern or something likely knows it right
[23:47:24] <kuudes> ah, nice
[23:50:33] <rmmh> daily reminder tether is the most obvious scam in a sea of scams
[23:51:32] <two2thehead> btw, rmmh thank you again for linking that face recognition state of the art survey study
[23:51:43] <rmmh> very welcome! did you read the whole thing?
[23:51:43] <mst> galambo: o/ shot through the arse / and you're to blame / you give buggery / a bad name o/
[23:52:12] <two2thehead> It's not an ELI5/go-to/basic-study, it's in the deliberate practice study category
[23:52:18] <two2thehead> Not, fully
[23:52:29] <rmmh> I've recently been using this and it's pretty nice: https://mediapipe.dev/
[23:52:30] <Robomot> MediaPipe
[23:52:32] <two2thehead> not fully, I need to keep rereading it
[23:53:02] <rmmh> largely because my desktop is AMD so most tensorflow stuff doesn't work natively
[23:53:52] <rmmh> but mediapipe has reasonably performant CPU implementations
[23:55:16] <galambo> I posted this on 31 jan 2020: in seriousness I dont think the coronavirus will amount to much
[23:55:35] <rmmh> ha-ha
[23:57:55] <gwern> mm. I think that was ex ante wrong. it was already community spread in the USA, and that takes you way up from the base-rate of 5-10%ish of "uh oh there's a new highly infectious airbone influenza-like disease in asia"
[23:59:30] <galambo> in my defence I bought one of those fallout masks from ebay on 1 feb 2020
