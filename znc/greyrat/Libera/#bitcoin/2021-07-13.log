[22:40:57] <gene> luckily world class nuclear scientists aren't affected by bullshit propaganda
[22:41:35] <earnestly> But they are.  There is substantially less development, funding or interest because it is politically difficult to do so
[22:42:56] <earnestly> So much is wasted on unreliable energy such as solar and wind, the former of which only needs to be covered with a small amount of dust to be left useless (many fields of these panels go by rotting, falling into disrepair due to the costs of maintainece) or the latter which only lasts 50 years, destroys the surrounding environment, and then can't be recycled because it's fiberglass - so they have
[22:42:58] <earnestly> to get burried
[22:43:00] <gene> was referring to the cold fusion project in Europe. one of the largest scientific undertakings in recent history
[22:43:46] <earnestly> cold fusion would require discovering new laws in physics
[22:44:20] <earnestly> But that too is limited due to the propaganda against nuclear physics.  Why get a degree in a field when you could just go into organic chemistry?
