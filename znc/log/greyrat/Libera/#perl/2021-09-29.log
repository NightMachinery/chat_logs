[03:16:39] <aquanight> hmm
[03:16:50] <aquanight> LeoNerd: do you think there's much call for an alternative of :accessor that returns the *old* value?
[03:17:53] <LeoNerd> Not without some larger system to provide atomic operations, no
[03:17:58] *** Quits: krismatrix (~krismatri@38.80.149.51) (Ping timeout: 265 seconds)
[03:18:33] <aquanight> ... eh?
[03:18:52] <LeoNerd> E.g. system calls like sigprocmask() have an *atomic* "fetch old value, set new value" ability
[03:18:56] <aquanight> -> method slot { local $_ = $slot; $slot = shift if @_; return $_; }
[03:19:14] <LeoNerd> Yes I know what you intend. I don't see a point in it
[03:19:18] <LeoNerd> Why would the caller call that?
[03:19:47] <aquanight> $old = thing->slot($new); ...(do stuff)... $thing->slot($old)
[03:19:58] <LeoNerd> That's what `dynamically` and :lvalue accessors are for
[03:19:58] <aquanight> next best thing we can get to local $thing->slot = $new;
[03:20:05] <LeoNerd> { dynamically $thing->slot = $new; ... }
[03:20:08] <LeoNerd> Already works
[03:20:31] <aquanight> guess I need to understand this 'dynamically' thing better.
[03:20:38] <LeoNerd> https://metacpan.org/release/PEVANS/Object-Pad-0.53/source/t/80dynamically+Object-Pad.t  -- has tested it since.. basically forever ;)

[03:20:46] <LeoNerd> "dynaimcally" is simply what "local" should have been

[03:34:48] <aquanight> LeoNerd: how feasible would it be for an attribute to generate a ->set(multiple => attributes, at => once) method from all :writer :mutator or :accessor slots?
[03:35:19] <aquanight> or maybe not an attribute but I don't know off hand what else it'd be
[03:35:23] <LeoNerd> An attribute on what..? would have to be on the class
[03:35:32] <LeoNerd> Might as well just apply that by some other blog of code
[03:35:34] <LeoNerd> *blob
[03:35:36] <LeoNerd> But anyway, not hard
[03:35:56] <LeoNerd> Harder would be, once they can have type assertions, *atomically* apply all-or-nothing
[03:36:13] <LeoNerd> Otherwise it woudl be really annoying if you mutated the first two then the third threw an exception

[03:36:40] <aquanight> no
[03:36:46] <LeoNerd> Otherwise, all it is is   method set(%values) { foreach my ($k,$v) (%values) { $self->$k($v); } }
[03:37:20] <aquanight> best I can come up with is basically some version of 'local' pushed on all slots, then call each method, if all succeed, discard saved state, otherwise revert
[03:37:33] <LeoNerd> Oh have we re√Ønvented STM?
[03:37:51] <LeoNerd> (because that worked /so/ well when Sun did it)
[03:38:21] <aquanight> I have no idea. I'm just basically thinking snapshot the object state, run the mutators, revert to last good state if any fail.
[03:38:32] <aquanight> that's not anyway close to atmoic
[03:38:38] <LeoNerd> Software Transactional Memory
[03:39:01] <aquanight> why does it sound awful even though it's so friggin basic
[03:40:11] <aquanight> I mean yes I can already see a few problems.
[03:41:09] <aquanight> It's technically possible to observe an intermediate state. And there's no clean way to resolve cross-dependant attributes that need to be updated effecitvely-simulatenously (I imaagine if you have such a dependancy, you won't have direct mutators of the slots and will have a dedicated mutator for that situation)
[03:41:28] <LeoNerd> See the "M" in STM
[03:41:41] <LeoNerd> It's not "software transactional objects". It's the entire memory state
[03:41:51] <aquanight> jesus h christ
[03:41:58] <aquanight> that sounds even worse than I was thinking
[03:42:29] <aquanight> and yeah that's the other problem, any partial mutation might have side effects even if the direct slots are reverted
[03:42:54] <LeoNerd> Oh, .. yeah the moment any non-memory operations get involved, you're basically screwed
[03:43:06] <LeoNerd> Turns out any non-academic example program might want to do some IO
[03:43:08] <aquanight> the only way you could really do it right is pre-validate before making any changes but then that's *still* no guarnatee unless all requirements are fairly trivial
[03:43:39] <aquanight> but at the same time
[03:44:04] <aquanight> we're not talking about a auto-method that makes arbitrary changes. We're talking about one that just uses auto-generated writers/mutators/accessors
[03:44:14] <aquanight> which are trivial { $slot = shift; } macros
[03:44:29] <LeoNerd> Right; but -that- one can already be trivially done with my oneliner above
[03:44:31] <aquanight> that only becomes problematic if you're tie()ing your slots. In which case you deserve what happens to you.

[10:57:46] <xq> iridium__: pattern matching in context of perl usually refers to matching strings with regular expressions
[10:58:25] <xq> as far as I understand, erlang pattern matching is a form of destructuring bind
[10:59:12] <xq> I don't think this is something often used in perl
[10:59:18] <xq> haven't seen much need for it either
[10:59:51] <xq> if you have a specific testcase with code where you think it's needed - maybe you should post it and someone could recommend a suitable perlish solution

[11:16:03] <The_Blode_> Good morning all.
[11:16:18] <The_Blode_> I had a question. I'm trying to use strict mode in my script and I'm seeing a compilation error.
[11:16:50] <The_Blode_> Global symbol "%AGI" requires explicit package name at file.

[11:17:32] <iridium__> xq: i know it's not used much. i was just wondering if some tooling is available for it.
[11:21:14] <The_Blode_> How do I initialise an empty hash array?
[11:21:39] <The_Blode_> I'm using my %AGI = "";
[11:21:51] <The_Blode_> Maybe I can use undef
[11:23:10] <vague> The_Blode_, = (); if you absolutely have to initialize it
[11:23:17] <iridium__> xq: thanks for the replies.
[11:23:38] <The_Blode_> Can I just declare it with my $AGI;
[11:23:45] <iridium__> The_Blode_: yeah.
[11:23:50] <The_Blode_> Got it.
[11:23:58] <The_Blode_> I'm used to declaring and initialising variables before using.
[11:24:26] <iridium__> The_Blode_: you can just say `my %AGI`. that should be enough.
[11:24:53] <iridium__> s/I/I;/g
[11:26:06] <vague> Yeah, the % is important to tell perl it's a hash. $ makes it a scalar which CAN be a hashref, but the access isn't the same
[11:26:47] <iridium__> The_Blode_: but try to always use `my`.
[11:26:47] *** Joins: choroba (~E.Choroba@88.146.255.106)
[11:27:59] <The_Blode_> Yes I always use my to declare variables.
[11:28:17] <The_Blode_> So my colleague asked me to enable strict mode in my new script and lots of variables didn't have my.
[11:28:34] <iridium__> The_Blode_: having strict mode always on is a good idea.
[11:28:42] <The_Blode_> When strict is disable, the script performs fine. When it's switched on, it does not work.
[11:29:24] <iridium__> you might have to do some changes to make it run with `use strict;`, sure.

[17:45:57] <Altreus> what, functionally, is the difference between a transaction and a savepoint?

[17:47:09] * GumbyPAN CPAN Upload: PICA-Data-1.33 by VOJ https://metacpan.org/release/VOJ/PICA-Data-1.33
[17:48:50] <ilmari> Altreus: a savepoint is a subtransaction, so you can recover from errors and roll back within a larger transaction
[17:49:23] <ilmari> https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-savepoint.html
[17:49:24] <Paperbot> Link title(s): [ PostgreSQL: Documentation: 13: SAVEPOINT ]
[17:51:45] <Altreus> is that significantly different from nested transactions?
[17:51:58] <Altreus> I assume it is or it wouldn't exist. I note SAVEPOINT accepts a name
[17:52:06] <Altreus> different behaviour in that regard
[17:52:26] <ilmari> yes, because you can have multiple active at the same time
[17:52:48] <Altreus> I'm struggling because our test harness sets up a transaction for the entire test, and then lets you use savepoints during the test - which was great until I wanted to include the SQLite database in it, and that's using DBI and not DBIC

[17:54:07] <Grinnz> transactions can't be nested. if you nest DBIx::Connector transactions it will transparently just run it in the largest transaction scope
[17:54:25] <Grinnz> if you try to start a transaction while one is active in pure DBI, you get gnome malleted

[17:55:22] <ilmari> DBIC can be configured to turn nested transactions into savepoints: https://metacpan.org/pod/DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI#auto_savepoint

[17:55:30] <Altreus> nor have I :/ the only reason this isn't DBIC is to save the overhead of having an entire schema
[17:55:47] <Grinnz> then it should be using DBIx::Connector
[17:56:15] <Altreus> right, that might be something I can do!

[21:31:04] <kensanata> I'm using perlbrew and hypnotoad and I suspect some of my Mojolicious applications run using 5.26 instead of 5.32; is there a way to invoke ps or htop such that I can see what perl binary has been used to start the app? Right now I just see the script name.
[21:31:57] <thrig> on linux /proc should have the interp path
[21:32:49] <thrig> or you could log suitable details in the mojo app
[21:33:09] <kensanata> Yeah. Looking at /proc right now.
[21:33:52] <thrig> $c->log->info("THIS IS Perl $], $^X") or somesuch
[21:33:55] <Grinnz> $^X is the path to the current executable
[21:35:04] <genio> I'm no longer young. stupid 40
[21:37:27] <kensanata> Yeah. In my case, these Mojolicious apps are already running and I'm wondering whether I can find out without stopping and starting them (that's what helped in the app I found by accident). So, I guess I'm just curious where I'd find that so that I can only restart the ones that need restarting.
[21:37:58] <thrig> or use lsof or such, ps(1) flags maybe but those are somewhat unportable
[21:41:01] <kensanata> for f in $(ps x | awk '/\.pl/ { print $1 }'); do ls -l /proc/$f/exe; done is at least confirming that a lot of 5.26 processes are still running. Yikes! 
[21:42:47] <Grinnz> lsof would be the reliable way, if you hot restarted a hypnotoad process to use a new perl its ps entry may not update

[21:54:30] <leitz> I take it you're not looking at your Docker version, but the main app server?
[21:56:16] <kensanata> Yeah. I'm continually spamfighting, added some code based on Net::IP to parse whois data to auto-ban entire networks, and suddenly I'm seeing that Net::IP is not installed‚Ä¶ uh‚Ä¶ and I discover that all my servers have been been reloading the apps for sure, but not actually restarting.

[21:58:36] <leitz> Cool. I've not done much on creating basic login stuff, so can't really advise there. The front page of your app might be a place to weed through requests; maybe make the page more basic and then have humans click to something custom?
