[01:30:52] <Celelibi> The main issue is that Medium posts tend to be very entry-level, and often seem to be written by people with little exoerience.
[01:33:19] <Celelibi> I don't know if it's the system of limited articles reading that pushes this trend, but I think medium posts used to be much more interesting a few years ago.
