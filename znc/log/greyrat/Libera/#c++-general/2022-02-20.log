[12:24:21] <paul424> HEllo, hello, I have such structure //! \brief List of all the tiles in the gamemap (used for human players seats only).TileStateNotified contains information about the tile    //! state (last tile state notified, vision last turn for this seat, vision for current turn, ...    std::map<Tile*,TileStateNotified> mTilesStates;
[12:25:00] <paul424> NOw the problem becomes when dealing with two maps , one hovering over the other. I have two somehow remember which Tile* belongs to which map. The obvious way would be to split it into two std::map's, but that's a lot of work ( lot of code sites use this container). ANyone has an idea for a clever trick ?
[12:25:18] <paul424> I have to*
[12:25:44] <ville> paul424: stop with the idea of "two maps"
[12:25:55] <paul424> ville, it's nearly complete :D
[12:25:58] <ville> no
[12:26:41] <ville> that's just sunken cost fallacy rationalizing you sticking with it
[12:27:12] <ville> just have 1 map. that's all. map owns the tiles.
[12:27:39] <ville> when you want to draw the map you generate a list of visible tiles, then you draw that list. not the map.
[12:29:19] <ville> if you want to draw some kind of overlay on top of it. you have a structure, if i remember your case correctly a rectangular selection in your case that has 4 things, starting x,y and width,height. these are in relation to the map. you then generate a visible list from this overlay structure and draw that list. not the overlay
[12:30:26] <ville> the overlay/selection does not own anything. it does not know anything about the tiles really. it just knows starting x,y and width,height which are just numbers
[12:31:32] *** Joins: c4017w_ (~c4017@209.52.68.8)
[12:32:46] <ville> if you wish to avoid overdraw you can check the visible tiles of the map you're about to draw against the overlay/selection if a selection is active
[12:33:14] <ville> an inative state for a selection is pretty easy just set all its members to 0
[12:33:17] <ville> inactive
[12:33:48] <ville> this way you have a very simple ownership model

[14:13:31] <johnny> usually undr 256kb
[14:13:52] <johnny> because it' too easy screw up with C++
[14:14:15] <johnny> too many footguns, no common build systems, poor library support for scripting or anything web related
[14:14:23] <johnny> and too many libs are written in C rather than C++
[14:15:22] <johnny> although i come from the unix/linux side where that's basically everything and C++ is not used for anything that's core to the system, only applications

[15:24:39] <ville> it's rigt there: typename std::iterator_traits<InputIt>::difference_type
[15:25:05] <DSpider> what... is that?
[15:25:27] <ville> std::distance is a function template and it's specified in a manner that the return type depends on the arguments you give to it
[15:26:31] <DSpider> right now I'm using with "auto": auto count = std::distance(std::filesystem::directory_iterator(std::filesystem::path(path)), {});
[15:27:05] <DSpider> to get the number of existing files from a folder
[15:27:43] <DSpider> it works... (as long as it only contains files, since it counts folders too), but I need to separate it on two lines
[15:27:56] <DSpider> and it can't be "auto", it has to has a specific type
[15:28:04] <DSpider> has to have*
[15:29:05] <DSpider> worst case, I can copy it from inside an 'if' condition, and let the compiler implicitly cast it as whatever numerical number it uses
