[00:11:53] <Sven_vB> TJ-, for the affected user it just gives the error from above. when I run it as root, it prins nothing, just runs about forever. when I remove the part behind <(…), it prints uint32 lines, seemingly forever.
[00:11:59] <PeGaSuS> EriC^: https://termbin.com/q5qpk ; before we continue much further, this laptop fall from a table and asked for a fsck and that's why I'm booting from the external drive though (if this helps to clean up something)

[00:20:58] <TJ-> Sven_vB: well without the < < () it will - that sends it a set of lines
[00:21:11] <PeGaSuS> just wondering what might lead to this issue..
[00:21:31] <TJ-> Sven_vB: the part inside the while read is getting the PID for each dbus session
[00:22:29] <TJ-> Sven_vB: if you tag " | wc -l" on the end it'll report the number of lines read. My user shows that as 56 on desktop
[00:22:56] <EriC^> PeGaSuS: no problem, the issue was somehow the efi packages were installed but you're not using efi, no idea how they got there though, if you really want to know you could investigate the /var/log/apt/history.log* to see how they got installed, it could be also the installer
