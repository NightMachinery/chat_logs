[00:33:57] <leElvyn> Hi, i have deployed a django web server with a postgresql DB using docker and docker compose. the compose file looks like this : https://pastebin.com/0uNCrfKd, and dockerfile : https://pastebin.com/R4LAJ0s4. However, i added an app to my project, and so would like to include it into docker. To do that, i have to move the docker files location,.
[00:33:58] <leElvyn> When doing that however, it starts a new container and the DB is completely empty.
[00:34:53] <leElvyn> How can i transfer the container from one folder to an other ?
[00:35:02] <leElvyn> or just dump the db and restore it ?
[00:39:54] <tabakhase> uh, pastebin.com now gets fully destroyed by ublock-origin
[00:41:03] <tabakhase> leElvyn moving your dockerfile shouldnt matter much - do you mean you moved the compose?
[00:42:24] <tabakhase> things in there get constructed with "projectname_thingname" - where projectname defaults to "parent folder" - you can overwrite this with "-P" or by setting the COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME env.var
[00:42:50] <tabakhase> (but migrating that sounds like the more reasonable indeed)

[02:12:03] <meks> How do you guys manage backups of your containers? I really can't decide what is the best way to do it
[02:13:09] <meks> Creating a cronjob to tar volumes and send them offsite won't scale well i think
[02:13:35] <gordonjcp> meks: this is relevant to my interests
[02:13:57] <gordonjcp> meks: at the moment I just run a cron job to run a command to back up the database and scp it to another server
[02:14:04] <gordonjcp> becase replication isn't a backup
[02:14:22] <meks> yes, this is what I think about doing now
[02:14:31] <meks> but this doesn't scale at all
[02:16:23] <meks> incremental backups would be better but diffing pgsql dumps sounds wrong
[02:18:43] <meks> I mean why do the backups in the first place? Just to rollback in case something breaks.
[02:19:21] <meks> Did anyone use btrfs snapshots as a backup solution? They can be moved offsite afaik

[02:34:09] <tianon> usually you need your software to have some means of "pausing" while you take the filesystem snapshot so that you can ensure the database files are in a consistent state for using that method
[02:38:25] <meks> does docker have this capability or is it application dependant?
[02:39:09] <dostoyevsky2> is docker save just saving the artefact created by build, or also saving all the diffs of the currently running containers?
[02:40:41] <meks> docs state that it just saves the image
[02:41:19] <dostoyevsky2> would make sense since you could have multiple instances of a container running, no?
[02:42:35] <meks> yes, and there is `docker export container` if you wish to export a specific container
[02:52:02] <Activ8> meks - my containers get backed up to an external account on mega.nz automatically twice a day
[02:52:13] <Activ8> I use duplicati
[02:52:35] <Activ8> one backup at 12:10am and the other at 11PM
[02:53:18] <Activ8> I have successfully done restores with no problems at all using this method
[02:56:48] <Activ8> I also wrote my own monitoring system in PHP webpage online/offline ports to monitor all of my docker containers I can access it externally so I can see if anything is down when I'm out.
[02:58:24] <meks> Activ8, do you backup just docker volumes? And do you stop/suspend containers during the backup?
[02:58:50] <meks> Are these backups incremental?
[02:59:40] *** Quits: flynn (~mcbloch@user/flynn) (Remote host closed the connection)
[03:00:02] *** Joins: flynn (~mcbloch@user/flynn)
[03:00:47] <meks> Healthcheks and graphs are great. I'm planning to do that with grafana
[03:01:02] <Activ8> don't suspend the containers as it's data inside the containers, yes incremental backups.  Scans the backup and then any changes pushes over the changed files.  I keep 1 copy of the files.
[03:01:33] <Activ8> when I mean data inside the containers I mean it's data that doesn't need the containers to be stopped.
[03:02:20] <meks> do you even backup live databases?
[03:03:42] <Activ8> I have in the past backed up mysql live database yes but moved that to an external host after I developed it.  I restored a mysql database and didn't stop the container first
[03:04:02] <Activ8> I broke the database and used duplicati to restore it to a working database.
[03:05:37] <Activ8> you would have to try a DR scenario, I can't comment on other databases.  Don't see why it wouldn't work but you would need to do your own tests
[03:06:55] <meks> so you don't backup databases with duplicati?
[03:07:44] <Activ8> I did before I moved it externally
[03:08:01] <shutnoshut> Wouldnâ€™t use it for databases, but Tarsnap does the trick for me to backup data outside the continers. 
[03:08:11] <meks> now that i think about it, just snapshotting a database would not be an option if multiple services use it. Will have to use pgsql_dump or somehting like that.
[03:10:36] <meks> are there any obvious downsides for filesystem snapshots?
[03:11:00] <meks> this functionality is literally builtin into kernel
[03:11:35] <meks> snapshots are incremental and you can send them to offsite
[03:11:47] <Activ8> even better
[03:11:55] <meks> and they take less than one second to backup/restore
[03:14:33] <Activ8> wouldn't that depend on how much data there is
[03:18:06] <meks> no, in case of btrfs it just does not delete old files on write

[10:10:11] <OverCoder> help
[10:10:38] <OverCoder> I have a dockerfile with some `yarn install` which basically installs node.js packages
[10:10:48] <OverCoder> when I build the container using `docker build` it works just fine
[10:11:05] <OverCoder> when the container gets built by docker-compose, `yarn` hangs as it builds some of the packages
[10:12:16] <OverCoder> there's a question on SO on someone having `yarn` hanging, and someone answered that using a terminal that's outside VS code causes it to work https://stackoverflow.com/a/63977042/2164304
[10:12:35] <OverCoder> how do I even remotely approach fixing this
[10:18:10] <OverCoder> ok I figured when I ran `docker build` I had the `--network host` flag set, just noticed, and apparently it's the why
[10:18:20] <OverCoder> but ok why does yarn need network host

[16:33:08] <wez> using the containers IP address (don't use localhost or 127.0.0.1)
[16:33:20] <diverdude> ok..no i dont have any firewall that i know of at least...nor kernel setting to disable ICMP
[16:35:05] <diverdude> using docker inspect on host i see that main container has : 172.18.0.2/16 and modl container has 172.18.0.3/16. So i will try to go to main container and run the command ping 172.18.0.3 ok?

[16:50:42] <diverdude> wez: hm...ok interesting. i can actually ping modl container from main container
[16:50:55] <wez> nice
[16:51:38] <diverdude> i just cannot  get response from nc -z cidxmodl 5000 for some reason :(

[16:52:51] <diverdude> wez: when i run nc -z 127.0.0.1 5000 from host i do get response
[16:53:11] <diverdude> wez: any idea what could be causing that then?
[16:54:16] <wez> diverdude: so dont use the name, use its IP address
[16:56:36] <diverdude> wez: but that also does not work. nc -z 172.19.0.3 5000 also does not give me any response
[16:56:54] <diverdude> ping 172.19.0.3 does give a response
[16:56:58] <diverdude> i dont get it
[16:57:22] <wez> Ir's not running on port 5000?
[16:57:55] <diverdude> yes it is...because from host i can do nc -z 127.0.0.1 5000  and i get a response
[16:58:49] <wez> diverdude: what is the port mapping setting?
[16:58:55] <wez> 5000:5000?
[16:59:17] <diverdude> yeah 5000:5000
[16:59:48] <diverdude> this is from docker ps: f87f64d8b4c0   projects_cidxmodl   "flask run"         10 minutes ago   Up 10 minutes   0.0.0.0:5000->5000/tcp, :::5000->5000/tcp   projects_cidxmodl_1
[17:01:34] <diverdude> wez: isnt it totally weird?
[17:03:20] <wez> Correct
[17:05:31] <diverdude> hmm ok maybe it has to do with how nz works on linux/mac....because if i use command curl -Is http://172.19.0.3:5000 to test instead then i get 404 on both container and host...meaning that webserver responds
[17:07:12] <wez> BBL
[17:07:19] <OverCoder> what's the difference between bridge network and host network
[17:07:43] <OverCoder> that causes yarn to install packages fine on both networks, but hang on a build step only when network mode is bridge
[17:08:12] <OverCoder> I don't get it, yarn gets to fetch all packages fine with either network setups, it only breaks when executing some build scripts but only on bridge network
