[00:34:29] <nemo> So. Just fixed another issue with the 4 ubuntu machines at work.  After replacing the gnome login with slim and reducing memory usage ten-fold, the admins said that the login still wasn't working
[00:34:42] <nemo> turns out gnome3 now requires gl acceleration which wasn't working in the web consoles.
[00:35:02] <nemo> sooooo followed some instructions for purging gnome3 (which wiped X too, but I just reinstalled it) and added a basic MATE

[02:28:29] <waveform> hjalp, the typical method for (at least temporarily) stepping down to a lower kernel version is to use "sudo flash-kernel --force <version>" assuming the <version> specified is still installed, e.g. "sudo flash-kernel --force 5.11-1015-raspi" but be aware that's only a temporary solution; the next kernel upgrade will run flash-kernel fresh which will copy the latest installed kernel to the boot partition

[02:30:52] <waveform> hjalp, the four dots on the boot screen are not a kernel upgrade attempt; that's just plymouth presenting a "pretty" boot screen during boot-up though I'm a little confused why that's appearing -- it's not on by default in ubuntu server, and ubuntu desktop images present a graphical "spinner" instead (though I'm not familiar with what xubuntu images do unfortunately)

[02:32:01] <hjalp> waveform after the kernel update at around 1014-raspi fried my Ubuntu builds, I had to wait for a kernel upgrade to Ubuntu Server (even on that side, on a brand new USB install, the OS was just booting to the rainbow of death)
[02:32:34] <waveform> if you specify something like "sudo flash-kernel --force 5.11-1015-raspi" it will expect to find "/boot/vmlinuz-5.11-1015-raspi" (and initrd.img, etc.)

[02:53:34] <waveform> hjalp, on boot messages, "journalctl -b" is usually enough to bring up the necessary bits, but sometimes there's extras in /var/log/syslog which can be useful

[02:56:18] <waveform> hjalp, well let's sort out that you're actually *getting* an fsck first -- are you seeing a message actually saying it's fsck'ing?

[11:34:25] <bailsman> What am I supposed to pkg-config on? I did pkg-config --libs grpc++ - which, sure enough prints -lgrpc++ but not any of the other libs grpc itself depends on
[11:36:50] <geirha> well, packages with names like  lib*-dev  will typically install a pkg-config file so you can then do e.g. pkg-config --cflags libpng  and  pkg-config --libs libpng  to get the right -I and -l options. So you'll have to do that for each dependancy, yes
[11:37:14] <geirha> usually the build system takes care of that automatically though. e.g. by running a configure script
[11:38:02] <bailsman> I'm writing a small cpp program that depends on grpc, and the tool I'd like is for it to just transitively add whatever grpc depends on so that I only have to remember that I'm using grpc
[11:38:08] <bailsman> that's what I'm used to from programming in other programming languages
[11:38:36] <bailsman> There's no configure script - presumably I'd have to make one. I'm not sure how - can that be autogenerated too?
[11:42:10] <geirha> Never heard of gprc, but it does sound odd that you'd have to track its dependencies as well for your own project. Surely it has some documentation to explain how to do it though?

[14:00:24] <ramblebamble> thyriaen, the soundserver might need encouragement to change the datasink
[14:00:54] <thyriaen> ramblebamble, how can i give the soundserver a jab ?
[14:00:57] <ramblebamble> e.g. I can have a BS Speaker connected to my Laptop and have one application use the BSSpeaker while another uses the speakers from my laptop
[14:01:28] <thyriaen> ramblebamble, ah but in my case when i go into settings i can hit "test speaker" and no sound comes out
[14:01:33] <ramblebamble> with pulseaudio try pavucontrol, I don't know about pipewire, using the pulseaudio shim for that one
[14:01:40] <thyriaen> so it is unlikely on the application side
[14:02:08] <ramblebamble> well where do you hit testaudio?
[14:02:20] <thyriaen> in the gnome sound settings
[14:02:39] <ramblebamble> Also please do not cross post in other channels
[14:02:52] <ramblebamble> I see your post on #linux as well, it is considered bad form
[14:02:58] <thyriaen> oh okay
[14:03:11] <fling> How to set /sys/module/zfs/parameters/zfs_arc_max on 20.04?
[14:03:14] <ramblebamble> well gnome does not configure the audio-server but uses its configuration only
[14:03:14] <fling> the module is loaded in initramfs

[19:24:39] <hjelp>  I've probed around the problem OS (the other one has no issues) and found a few things in the boot-up that might explain things, for instance 'journalctl -b' shows that i.e. the Device-Mapper Multipath Device controller fails to start, due to it failing to increase buffer size
[19:24:41] <waveform> well, I'm not surprised I couldn't replicate it with the server image: if a simple upgrade of a server image resulted in busted boot the certification team would almost certainly have picked it up already (that stuff gets tested automatically). But Xubuntu don't have any pi images, so I'm wondering what exactly those are

[19:26:55] <hjelp> Oh yes, I've used that one, I'm not 100% it's on this build though, but definitely at least in the past. Probably in this one too; there was no official Ubuntu Desktop available back then and frankly it's too cumbersome even on some desktops
[19:27:41] <waveform> I'm not sure that's been kept up to date given that we started releasing "official" desktop images. To my mind the "supported" way of getting a xubuntu desktop on a pi at the moment would to start from the official desktop image, install xubuntu-desktop (with gdm3 login manager), reboot and switch session to xubuntu

[19:33:23] <waveform> hjelp, no, I'm reasonably certain at this point that your kernel install is busted in some obscure way (multipath modules are definitely there in 1016) -- honestly at this point I'd say reflash a fresh image, don't enable proposed on it, and go from there
[19:33:54] <ice9> is there a nice task/todo software that you can recommend?
[19:34:31] <hjelp> waveform I did try to keep it all synced with rsync -rvai ; I wonder if I could do some sort of a transplant attempt with the Ubuntu Server 21.04 or should I rather flash a desktop image and try to work from that?

[23:39:56] <pankaj> I am following above to install LAMPP
[23:39:58] <pankaj> Is it fine ?
[23:40:48] <oerheks> that is fine, xampp can give weird issues on ubuntu
[23:40:56] <oerheks> !xampp
[23:40:56] <ubottu> We do not support XAMPP installs here. Please use the LAMP stack that is in our repositories; see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ApacheMySQLPHP for more information.
[23:41:29] <oerheks> https://ubuntu.com/server/docs/lamp-applications is a good start
