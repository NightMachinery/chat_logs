[04:15:40] <wasamasa> s-liao: once again I have no idea what you're talking about with breadline
[04:20:55] <s-liao> I mean that once the session of REPL hold for a while, let us say, I went out to pick my child back from her school. The ssh session is so kind of running slowly. But it is in REPL. As loading one function into the current session by copying and pasteing one function into REPL.
[04:22:28] <s-liao> I was in Window, ssh to VM, where the chicken compiler is hosted
[04:26:05] <s-liao> There is like for the indent in the egg breadline. there is jumping the cursor around the matched parentheses.
[04:28:14] <s-liao> As an end user. he/she is in REPL of Chicken. Although it is about ssh issue. But they will complaint REPL. not ssh.
[04:30:35] <s-liao> I mean that it is possible for user to forward-sexpr.
[04:39:15] <wasamasa> not my problem
[04:39:29] <wasamasa> use mosh
[04:41:40] <s-liao> Let me check in the gambit, there is a similar feature the breadline egg offer
[04:43:15] <s-liao> Yes, you are right. mosh solved that issue ssh has.
[05:02:55] <s-liao> I just checked in the gambit, the indent for copy and past of the piece code to load into the RELP,  it jump between of the outer parentheses  of the whole s-expression.
[05:04:15] <s-liao> Then it can be like forward-expr as like we are in Emacs.
[05:15:52] <s-liao> The automatic jump for the indent of parentheses can be off by setting (variable-bind! "blink-matching-paren" "off") in breadline egg
[05:16:35] <s-liao> But what about the forward-sexpr?
[05:16:47] <s-liao> I have not found out it yet.

[10:56:43] <wasamasa> s-liao: feel free to contribute a solution for that, it's non-trivial
[10:58:51] <s-liao> Not really. I still am learning yours.
[10:59:00] <wasamasa> you'd at the very least need to expose readline API for setting point and adding a new command, then port an implementation of forward-sexp
[10:59:09] <wasamasa> which probably requires an implementation of forward-symbol first
[10:59:27] <wasamasa> which probably needs a definition of what a symbol is
[11:00:50] <s-liao> Yes. That is a good idea.
[11:05:42] *** Quits: mdhughes (~mdhughes@user/mdhughes) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[11:05:50] <s-liao> How can Readline realized what a symbol is in term of scheme implementation?
[11:05:58] <wasamasa> readline is beside the point here
[11:06:31] <wasamasa> think beyond readline
[11:06:57] <wasamasa> given an input line and the position of point, devise an algorithm for moving a symbol forward

[16:22:28] <jcowan> Presumably there already is a forward-{symbol,sexp} in Elisp that can be translated to Scheme.
[16:31:01] <s-liao> Why Presumably?
[16:33:57] <megane> presumably because emacs has such a feature
[16:34:22] <megane> it could be written in C in reality, though
[16:38:26] <s-liao> But almost all of code is written in Scheme, except runtime.c file.
[16:39:15] <s-liao> How can c realized all scheme symbols?
[16:41:28] <s-liao> It is all in GC?
[16:41:48] <megane> s-liao: jcowan meant that emacs has such a function written in elisp already. you could try converting that to scheme
[16:42:53] <s-liao> But what if one symbol have not loaded to the current REPL.
[16:43:58] <s-liao> Emacs end up to scan_lists which is in syntax.c file.
[16:47:43] <s-liao> Who know gambit implement more? It is already in gambit
[16:47:55] <megane> yup
[16:53:49] <s-liao> In REPL in gambit, you can like what we do in Emacs, Ctrl+Alt+-> to forward-sexpr
[16:54:46] <s-liao> it is in /root/gambit/gsi file.I guess.
[16:56:48] <s-liao> We might need to check with the implantation of gambit.
[16:57:04] <s-liao> It would be much faster.
[16:57:54] <s-liao> sound like mangol work with them before.
[16:58:19] <s-liao> mangol can you help us a little bit.
[17:35:15] <s-liao> megane it is about the c function lineeditor_move_cursor_plain  in /root/gambit/lib/os_tty.c file
[17:35:44] <s-liao> It is much deep into the insider.
