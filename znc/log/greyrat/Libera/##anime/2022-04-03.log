[03:53:19] <DerHirnschlag> Hmm, that's still in the safe area with 20%. Wiki mentions regarding human toxicity: "At doses of 0.8–1.5 g/day (50–100 g cocoa), sweating, trembling and severe headaches were noted, with limited mood effects found at 250 mg/day."
[03:54:26] <DerHirnschlag> But I ate around 1700g of dark chocolate covered ginger breads in three days (yea, some sort of short-time addiction by chance, you could say.. no, ain't obese), that's quite a big amount of cocoa actually. Humm.

[04:16:05] <DerHirnschlag> Watched like ten other Isekais recently, but the names are a thing which hardly left a marker to remember. Rough translations were "under gods graces", "Redo of healer" which is surely adult-rated from the uncut edition's mess, then the "Now I'm a spider" somewhat one.
[04:16:43] <Kill-Animals> redo of healer was porn basically. I'll check out spider, and under gods graces
[04:17:25] <vegii> does "porn basically" mean it's on par with HOTD?
[04:17:27] <DerHirnschlag> The spider-one was funny through many mixed elements. "Now I'm a spider, so what?" or similar should be the title in english.
[04:17:30] <Kill-Animals> DerHirnschlag: I have the isekais where the girl kills a bunch of slimes over a hundred years and levels up. Its boring. What else... I couldnt make it through the smartphone isekai. It was bad
[04:17:55] <Kill-Animals> that does sound fun.
[04:18:05] <Kill-Animals> The reincarnated as a slime was awful imo.

[04:18:57] <DerHirnschlag> Reincarnated as a slime I found okay, nothing especially good or bad, but it had some smaller aspects which were interesting, like the physical damage resistance in "human" form.
[04:19:19] <DaPinkOne> the 100 years slime anime did seem to drag on a bit
[04:19:22] <ButterNoodle> slime is nipple

[04:20:14] <DaPinkOne> Kill-Animals, highschool of the dead is basic fanservice by today's standards
[04:20:16] <DerHirnschlag> Vegii : regarding the "Redo of Healer"? It's uh, a quite sadistic one and exists in a cut and an uncut variant. Quick description without spoilers: Lots of mobbing and mainly sexual abusing in extreme forms and after the "Isekai" aspect started, it basically got into a revenge story.
[04:20:17] <ButterNoodle> oh

[04:21:26] <ButterNoodle> DaPinkOne: not yet
[04:21:36] <DerHirnschlag> But interestingly enough it had a consistent story. So not just a hentai or porn with useless or unlogical story. The protagonist basically kept the story from beginning to end thoroughly planned, that was well made.

[04:34:18] <Kill-Animals> DerHirnschlag: hmmm
[04:34:48] <vegii> I think of the phase in my life when I've been watching all those fucking seasons of zero no tsukaima
[04:34:51] <Kill-Animals> I love high fantasy as well. Record of Lodoss War continues to be one of the coolest anime.
[04:35:03] <DerHirnschlag> Kill-Animals : The act itself wasn't special, but his naive neutrality made it worthwhile. Like "he really meant the best for a fair outcome".
[04:35:36] <Kill-Animals> vegii: Zero was not bad for what it is. 
[04:36:15] <Kill-Animals> its actually decent. The MC is a bit perpetually young though, and the side characters are comically bland and tropish.
[04:36:16] <vegii> I've also seen like 2-3 seasons of infinite stratos
[04:36:38] <Kill-Animals> DerHirnschlag: I'll be downloading it tonight then.
[04:38:13] <DerHirnschlag> But remember, it's three seasons from what I found and the first one has 73 Eps - as such no idea how it develops after the first six and a half Eps. Can be good, can be bad. So far the plain honest naive behavior got my interest.

[04:42:47] <Kill-Animals> vegii: Rei and Asuka aren't strong though. 
[04:42:50] <DerHirnschlag> Kill-Animals : Understandable and why I watch anime mostly in 1,5x to 1,75x speed. Even "filler" Eps ain't a big boredom, this way. It's not as if something would be missed (I often use 5 seconds playback to rewatch a specific scene), but the whole activities shown are less pulled into the length.
[04:42:51] <Kill-Animals> misato is 
[04:43:16] <DaPinkOne> Kill-Animals, the theory is that it was rough for the lowbies, and the bosses are stupid hard, but regular floor trash isn't that bad with a coordinated team
[04:43:16] <Kill-Animals> But even misato; her legs turn to jello around men.
[04:43:25] <DaPinkOne> but they still suck at game/encounter design
[04:44:03] <Kill-Animals> DerHirnschlag: Not a bad idea lol
[04:44:22] <vegii> Kill-Animals: ok how about Faye Valentine?
[04:44:24] <DaPinkOne> vegii, isn't misato a full grown woman in her 20s, flirting with like a 14 year old MC?
[04:44:58] <DerHirnschlag> I remember "Bleach" as there were only around 60 Eps out, then I stopped watching (I hate waiting for new Eps or seasons, so I just watch them all again on a later time, preferably after completion). Then there were around 147 or so Eps out. Watched the first ~60 again with 2x speed in one day and was not bored, even as I remembered much of it
[04:44:58] <DerHirnschlag> instinctively.
[04:45:19] <DaPinkOne> I don't watch at speed, but i rarely rewatch
[04:45:30] <Kill-Animals> vegii: its been awhile but someone like Faye Valentine is realistic in the sense that her power comes largely from her sexual appeal.
[04:45:34] <DaPinkOne> I don't really watch the show if I can't devote attention to it
[04:45:56] <DaPinkOne> Kill-Animals, she's got charisma for days too
[04:46:15] <Kill-Animals> I am definitely down with that type of "strong woman". Not however with a woman who can arm wrestle grown men to the ground.
[04:46:17] <vegii> DaPinkOne: yh you know, there are girls in their 16-18s that are into 40-50yr old men, that's even worse
[04:46:40] <DerHirnschlag> But afterwards I tried watching the "new" Eps with 1x speed, that was the horror. And it seemed to get more and more fillers. With 1,5 to 1,75x speed I got without problems to the end on that time (around 145 or 147), so that was acceptable.
[04:46:51] <vegii> like I know a woman in her 20s who's into grandpas
[04:47:02] <DaPinkOne> vegii, being attracted to older men isn't problematic. it's problematic if anything comes of it. see also: the xkcd creepy zone

[04:56:34] <DaPinkOne> vegii, yes, there's  dragonball, dragonbal z, GT, and a slew of more
[04:56:35] <Kill-Animals> Dragonball the original is a fantastic anime
[04:56:46] <Kill-Animals> Next to perfect
[04:57:21] <Kill-Animals> Anything else besides the original dragonball is bleh. A lot of bleh with a few shining moments. 
[04:57:49] <Kill-Animals> Early dragonball z, the the saiyan arc is excellent but after that its all just a bunch of crap.
[04:57:50] <Smeef> As in something has to negate all the tangled webs of conflicts and unite all the likable characters, like the scourge in WoW, or the Flood in Halo, or the white walkers in GoT
[04:58:02] <DaPinkOne> i thought DBZ was a bit drawn out, but I hear they fixed a lot of that in the remastered cut a few years back
[04:58:15] <vegii> db kai 2nd season is a shining moment, a throwback to the early volumes of dragonball manga vibes
[04:58:18] <Kill-Animals> DaPinkOne: You mean dragonball z abridged?
[04:58:31] <DaPinkOne> Kill-Animals, no, DBZ abridged is a different thing, and a parody
[04:58:41] <DerHirnschlag> Dragonball never got my attention much, somehow. Probably because it was a) aired in TV and one had to wait and wait for new short Eps and b) I could never recognize a "final date" where sitting down and binge watching all Eps at once would be possible. Hm.
[04:59:14] <Kill-Animals> DaPinkOne: They cancelled it. Those guys are such morons -- Got rid of their only talented property.
[04:59:53] <DaPinkOne> DBZ abridged wasn't made by the original cast. It was all volunteers, and it was expensive and time-intensive to keep that going(I think it was team four star?)
[04:59:55] <Kill-Animals> DerHirnschlag: If you ahd to watch it on TV, its a nightmare given every episode relates to the last.
[05:00:26] <Kill-Animals> DaPinkOne: Of course it was expensive and time intensive. But they also are/were able to cash in on it.
[05:01:09] <DaPinkOne> there's quite a bit more to DBZ abridged than i remember
[05:01:12] <Kill-Animals> Instead they decided to do things like, "Hellsing Abridged" -- WHY? ITS NOT LONG? IT DOESNT NEED TO BE ABRIDGED YOU MOR-
[05:01:28] <DaPinkOne> hellsing abridged was pretty funny
[05:01:42] <vegii> I haven't actually seen the dragonball anime before kai
[05:01:56] <vegii> just read the manga instead
[05:02:01] *** Quits: weebuwu (~weebuwu@user/weebuwu) (Quit: WeeChat 1.4)
[05:02:08] <DaPinkOne> and the hellsing series was probably long enough for it, considering it's like 10 * 2hr ovas
[05:02:40] <Kill-Animals> DaPinkOne: I couldnt watch it. I thought it was missing the point of the formula.
[05:02:41] <DaPinkOne> i wish seras victoria got more time on screen though
[05:02:42] <vegii> also, even fucking db kai... the last 30 minutes of planet Namek lasted like 30 episodes
[05:02:52] <DaPinkOne> she didn't come into her own until near the end of the show
[05:03:07] <Kill-Animals> vegii: kek thats pretty funny
[05:03:08] <DerHirnschlag> Kill-Animals : That's for sure.. I can't watch on "regular days / times" as such this concept of TV Eps early fell out, in the 80s of last century (yes, I'm old).
[05:03:51] <Kill-Animals> DerHirnschlag: Unless it was on after school, chances are that I'd miss an episode here and there.
[05:04:08] <DerHirnschlag> One of the reasons why "waiting for Ep X to arrive" never gained anything aside hate from me. I prefer to put the whole season or anime in a drawer of thoughts and after it's completed watch it in one procession.
[05:04:22] <vegii> I'm not a fan of the 1st season of db kai... 97 episodes iirc
[05:04:28] <vegii> but 2nd season was good
[05:04:29] <Kill-Animals> jeepers
[05:04:44] <vegii> and it was like all fillers
[05:04:56] <jessedesu_onaph> Anyone seen flying witch?
[05:05:04] <Kill-Animals> Well I havnt seen it. Frankly the anime that has me eagerly awaiting every next episode is One Punch Man.
[05:05:19] <vegii> jessedesu_onaph: kiki's delivery service?
[05:05:28] <jessedesu_onaph> Makoto
[05:05:41] <Kill-Animals> "Kowata Makoto is an air head with a bad sense of direction that just moved into her relative's house... But is that all?"

[05:06:06] <Kill-Animals> I'm sold
[05:06:07] <DerHirnschlag> Kill-Animals : Hmm, up to the 2000s it was quite hard to find a reliable, all-day accessible way to watch a specific, often hard to receive (only satellite or cable) channel in this country. Around the millennium change it was easier thanks to P2P file sharing. ;-)
[05:06:11] <vegii> 2nd season of one punch man was meh
[05:06:16] <DaPinkOne> flying witch was alright, It got kinda slow/SoL near the end, and I stopped at 10/12
[05:06:49] <jessedesu_onaph> I like girls with the hime haircut style apparently
[05:06:50] <Kill-Animals> DerHirnschlag: Yep. Even with torrents it was still fairly difficult, because seeding etc.
[05:07:09] <jessedesu_onaph> Like eru chitanda
[05:07:28] <Kill-Animals> vegii: It was great. Not as good as the first, but I still loved it.
[05:07:47] <Kill-Animals> jessedesu_onaph: Like hinata?
[05:08:05] <jessedesu_onaph> I think so
[05:08:54] <DerHirnschlag> Smeef : "As in something has to negate all the tangled webs of conflicts and unite all the likable characters, like the scourge in WoW, or the Flood in Halo, or the white walkers in GoT" <= Yes, that's true. But on the other hand unforeseen development changes can (not always bring, unfortunately) reignite the interest in the further development.
[05:09:25] <Smeef> Yeah, the zombie thing is just poor writing
[05:10:20] <DerHirnschlag> Zombie things are quite often a sort of last resort, if all "logical" or scientific explanations would result in explanation problems.
[05:10:25] <Kill-Animals> Violet Evergarden thus far is probably the best netflix anime I have watched. Havnt finished it yet but its very good.
[05:10:47] *** Quits: Lord_Vlad (~Lord_Vlad@ptr-178-51-214-57.dyn.mobistar.be) (Quit: Leaving)
[05:11:04] <DerHirnschlag> As with "hey, now there are zombies and those were made by stone x or curse y or .." is quite easy to put in place and hard to reason around.
[05:13:15] <DerHirnschlag> That's one of the reasons why many of the ghost anime are somewhat confusing, if in one Ep the ghosts obviously can't touch or hurt / wound the "humans" or "mages" or whatever directly, but by indirect means. And a few episodes further the main antagonist seems to be just a plain pure ghost waiting for resurrection or whatever and directly
[05:13:15] <DerHirnschlag> inflicting physical results. But hard to argue because ghosts (same with zombies) don't offer a logical weak point, they don't offer no logic point at all.

[05:45:29] <DerHirnschlag> Ah, thanks for the explanation! Regarding remote particles in the eyes it's better not to irritate it, as the swelling hinders the self-cleaning process.

[05:47:46] <DerHirnschlag> Good choice, hopefully it gets better quickly.
[05:47:52] <snake> i was just a kid so i didnt goto doctors unless my parents took me lol
[05:49:31] <DerHirnschlag> (If the eye is not irritated / inflammated, it might be enough to sleep a while, as it does subconscious movements related to the disturbing particles positions, as such it is well possible to have the particles easily removable in the corner of the eye on waking up, but if it's already scratched then that doesn't help much unfortunately.)

[07:50:06] <Ninetails> If we judge from the recent thoughts spent about Smeef s Zombieprophecies as well as the recent developments in this surrogate simulated world, the time to be alive could soon turn into a time to be a zombie any time to come. ;-)

Hopefully the Zombiecon's (or "Zombeacons"?) ain't including a feeling of unease in feel-able rotting bodies which basically fall apart on a cellular level, breaking down and not being able to regenerate (quickly?) enough to sustain their composure.

[08:07:09] <MootPoot> https://primecomputer.co/products/primebook-circular/
[08:07:11] <ImoutoBot> [title] PrimeBook Circular | Overview
[08:09:07] <amigojapan> Let me see MootPoot 
[08:11:21] <amigojapan> MootPoot: I am not as much info ecology as you
[08:11:30] <amigojapan> Into*
[08:11:38] <Ninetails> Overpriced for something which won't get upgraded in roughly 99,99785% of all cases.
[08:11:48] <MootPoot> well, its another modular laptop like the framework one
[08:12:02] <amigojapan> Ah I see MootPoot 
[08:13:31] <Ninetails> Disadvantages through sustained mainboard components, i.e. chipset and link bandwiths, even a new CPU can't use it's new features fully with it and will always run in a compatibility mode to some degree. Disadvantages through non-changeable mechanical abrasion / wear-prone components. Or if changeable: the work and skill to do this would outline
[08:13:32] <Ninetails> around 99% of all customers and service points are too expensive.
[08:13:53] <Ninetails> A good advertisement, but no ecologic concept. Sadly.
[08:14:29] <jessedesu2> Butternoodle good thinking
[08:15:10] <MootPoot> the entire chipset and mainboard get upgraded every time
[08:15:27] <MootPoot> its a whole board
[08:15:45] <MootPoot> you cant make a laptop that thin and modular on the cpu level - there are some sacrifices
[08:16:17] <Ninetails> But this unfortunately requires compatibility concepts related to the connectivity layers lengths, which have to be specifically designed for the required clock rates, part distances and so on.
[08:16:20] <MootPoot> as for repair - they are mostly selling to other enterprises - their internal IT support can handle the fix
[08:16:36] <MootPoot> Ninetails: no...the entire board gets swapped out
[08:16:40] <MootPoot> every time you upgrade
[08:16:50] <MootPoot> all of those concerns are moot
[08:16:54] <Ninetails> Yes, but not the predefined hardware outlets. The chassis.
[08:17:07] <Ninetails> Placement of battery. Port placement. Fan and cooling module placement.
[08:17:15] <MootPoot> you can work around that just fine?
[08:17:22] <Ninetails> Tunnels for flat cables.
[08:17:35] <MootPoot> its not like you have to redesign everything for a new cpu
[08:18:03] <amigojapan> I have broken my screen more than once, so easy repair of screen sounds attractive
[08:18:34] <MootPoot> the usb C standard is going to be the main one going forward so you can literally use the same port
[08:18:38] <MootPoot> again and again
[08:18:39] <Ninetails> Sure you can, but it requires compromises. If the hardware design changes over generations which are actually big enough to .. indulge the need or want of customers to upgrade (which is rarely given after 1-3 years, even less in business concepts), then they are often more efficient or room-/weight-saving with a redesign.
[08:20:30] <Ninetails> Rarely anyone with a corei7 mobile platform of the 11th generation would even think about upgrading their laptop to a corei7 of the 12th generation as example. Maybe the 15th generation. And who knows if the necessary parts, upgraded standards are then still compatible enough to sufficiently reduce the compatibility based backlashes in "keeping the
[08:20:30] <Ninetails> shell and some placements / parts and swapping the board".
[08:20:57] <MootPoot> we already do that with PC cases
[08:21:09] <MootPoot> if you care about a smaller example, mini ITX has been a standard for ages
[08:21:16] <MootPoot> mini itx case from 2010 is still useful today
[08:21:25] <MootPoot> its doable, and we have been doing it
[08:22:51] <Ninetails> Yes, with PC cases which are not optimized for the least-possible space usage and weight. Even ITX cases don't weight reliably less than an µATX case, as example. They don't necessarily only include 0-1 PCIe brackets to save weight. But a mobile system is a bit differently: you have a shell which was made to save the maximum on weight, deliver a
[08:22:52] <Ninetails> stable and reliable protective (i.e.: protection where it is needed) outerior for a specific interior
[08:25:05] <Ninetails> If you think it's a good idea, just ignore my two cents. I am just a mad scientist and develop tech which people don't see all days privately (basically a sort of Rick-engineer, but without the garage part). I can tell you the exact disadvantages of such a concept and why it still sounds good and hip, but at the end there will be not many of the
[08:25:05] <Ninetails> initial buyers which actually buy the upgrades. It never succeeded in mobile areas, even with multiple companies XX times the size and manufacturing bandwidth being behind. MXM anyone?
[08:25:41] <Ninetails> That's why it doesn't really uh, lets me applaud it. That's all.
[08:27:47] <amigojapan> Steak at ikinari steak seems to have gone up in price :(
[08:28:04] <Ninetails> On that price level of the small computer systems @ prime computers for business customers in small order sizes (I just checked the private customers prices and subtracted 20% for this, as no account is available from the resellers right now) you can create the exact same calculative power two times with an Intel NUC - and that's one of the more
[08:28:04] <Ninetails> costy examples.
[08:28:30] <Ninetails> That's all I say. If anyone wants to buy this or supports it: Great, absolutely nothing to say against.

[08:32:58] <Ninetails> No need to, I hope it tastes well and the prices are acceptable!
[08:34:04] <amigojapan> The price was about 21usd
[08:34:24] <Nanobot> Miko taught me the word "pendejo".
[08:36:15] <Ninetails> 21 usd, that's fine. I assume there was rice delivered separately with it, from how it looks?
[08:37:08] <amigojapan> Ninetails: no the rice was extra
[08:37:58] <Ninetails> Oh, pricey then, but it looks at least made with understanding what gets approved by the eyes of the customers, which is great.
[08:40:09] <Ninetails> One aspect I am .. absolutely envious of in regards of Japanese and even some Chinese (but more the Thai fraction) of food culture. This (my) country just has ab-so-lu-te-ly no interest in the all-day food delivering or offering stores and restaurants to "please the aesthetic appearances the customers would love to get with their food to feel that

[08:49:51] <MootPoot> rss is still a thing?

[08:50:02] <Nanobot> Yes, but not nearly as common as I wish it were
[08:50:13] <Nanobot> nyaa still has an RSS feed.
[08:50:16] <MootPoot> least I heard it all got replaces by push notificatioins
[08:50:44] <Nanobot> Still, parsing the nyaa feed is difficult. I have to use heuristics to figure out which anime series the torrents actually relate to.
[08:50:55] <Nanobot> Based on the title and the timing of the episode number.
[08:51:21] <Nanobot> (and they're often inconsistent in how they format the titles)
[08:52:34] <MootPoot> speaking of I never got my sonarr box up
[08:52:52] <Nanobot> For my media manager to know what a torrent is, it *must* associate it with an anime from anidb. The whole reason I wrote it in the first place was so I could select which series I want to watch (based on anidb entries) and it would automatically download the torrents for me as they came in.
[08:53:23] <amigojapan> Ok I devowered 450grams of steak
[08:53:51] <Ninetails> Yea, understandable that restaurant visits are a "special" aspect of food intake. Not different for us over here, but unfortunately there's almost no aesthetically, food value appealing presentation and worthy production anymore to find in the all-day food stores around here. No matter if butcher, bakery, some street stand or an italian / turkish /

[08:55:15] <Ninetails> They all only focus on one thing: Utmost cheapest production with utmost lowest time invested. Even skipping necessary steps whenever possible (often leads to unhealthy results as well).
[08:56:07] <Ninetails> That's why I love restaurant visits in different countries. No matter if cheap ones or more expensive ones, hard to find one owner who doesn't actually care about what they sell.
[08:56:27] <amigojapan> I'm sorry Ninetails 
[08:57:31] <Ninetails> It's our own fault, no worries. People want fast food and ignore -all- aspects of healthy, tasty, natural, aesthetic or well-made and presented concepts.
[08:59:30] <Ninetails> And that's the result if the sellers don't care anymore. Nowadays I suggest people to go to the nearest super market and grab any cheap pre-packed industrial produced salad, buy a pack of hard cooked eggs, a few carrots, maybe some sausage and cheese and eat this cheap mass-produced but at least half-way healthy result, it tastes better than 95%+
[08:59:31] <Ninetails> of all the "restaurants" and even most bakeries which just use industrally made dumplings and bake them up for 10-20 minutes them self.
[09:01:12] <MootPoot> I can't tell if you are trolling or not
[09:01:17] <Ninetails> it's a shame. As such: don't come to Germany, if you want to find enjoyable "fast" food aside quite expensive restaurants (those exist, but compared to the fast food and cheap store food it's like 1 vs. 25.
[09:01:41] <amigojapan> Ninetails: this restaurant used to be cheap before Corona
[09:03:01] <Ninetails> Nah, I am not. Has a reason why I rarely buy food from those stores anymore. It looses it's value to spend quite high prices on food not worth the price, if you can cook the same ten times better for a ways cheaper price (in almost the same time as such stores often have 60 - 80 minutes waiting times, tho).
[09:03:41] <amigojapan> Ninetails: very little waiting time here
[09:03:45] <Ninetails> Why should I be trolling if I like good food? Would be happy to declare otherwise but it's really hard to find good stores or all-day restaurants anymore.
[09:06:39] <Ninetails> amigojapan : The usual delivery times or pre-order times vary, surely. In bigger cities there are as well established mass-producers as pizza hut, subways and so on. McDonalds, Burger King.
[09:07:34] <amigojapan> This is not delivery
[09:08:21] <Ninetails> You can go there as well yourself, but you won't get anything that resembles what you showed on the picture.. that's the problem, not the time on ordering locally.
[09:09:18] <Ninetails> And the big chains ain't really what i understand as fresh or tasty food. It's highly spiced and sometimes "tasty" in terms of "overloading your umami / sweet / spicy taste receptors and carrying enough salt to overtone all other flavors" fast food. Nothing I would drive to explicitly to enjoy the food. Just driving there if I need something to eat
[09:09:18] <Ninetails> and they are the only ones open on the way.
[09:10:41] <Ninetails> But restaurants where you actually enjoy the look, the feel of what you get delivered (and how), those are very rare. Even in this small city it's like 1 of 10 which offers this.. was offering this before corona and nowadays it's maybe 1 of 25, as many closed down.
[09:10:56] <Ninetails> delivered = to your place, not your home.
[09:11:08] <MootPoot> why is a line of text called a string
[09:11:11] <MootPoot> why not just call it text
[09:11:39] <amigojapan> Ninetails: this restaurant is probably one of the cheapest for steak in Japan tho
[09:12:22] <Ninetails> And still offers something I wouldn't think twice about and eat right away, even if I were full. That's a good impression. ;)

[09:21:54] <amigojapan> Let me see Ninetails 
[09:21:56] <Ninetails> But they more or less deliver pizzas which look like this: https://media1.faz.net/ppmedia/aktuell/387965964/1.6759915/default/duenner-boden-dicker-boden-mit.jpg - Drown in cheese or random sauces (or even - and not just a slight amount - ketchup and mayonnaise). Or dryly baked with an even top without distinguishable ingredients.

[09:23:30] <Ninetails> And that's just one horrid example of what goes quite pricey nowadays. It reaches all areas of food styles. amigojapan : That is possible, but from the look I assume it's just a "modern natural shaped hipster style" or something which was made by skipping the extraction of the dough in an evenly manner. Lol
[09:24:08] <amigojapan> I see Ninetails 
[09:25:33] <Ninetails> This goes as well for as example "Döner" / Kebab. Drown. In. Sauce. And made from 100% freshly heated industrial produced ingredients. Okay, maybe not the salad, this one is cut in place and used for two days (hopefully not longer..) thanks to refrigerator storage over night.
[09:26:11] <Ninetails> It's just missing all .. every aspect of love for the food. For the stuff they actually intended to sell, to offer. And that leaves me sad.
[09:26:25] <ButterNoodle> I mean noodle pizza..
[09:28:00] <Ninetails> Noodle pizza? Why not fish stick pizza? Don't take it as a joke, a German industrial food producer (and household wares producer) actually answered the "many calls of their fans in regards of such a pizza" with this: https://static01.eu/1prospekte.de/images/uploads/300322/dr.-oetker-ristoranten-mit-fischstabchen33308.jpg

[12:12:40] <Ninetails> There's just no functioning turing test which would sustain a proof regarding humans if those were selected randomly in random status effects. It's as simple as can be. Give a human three promille of alcohol in the blood and they will fail to even distinguish a mere shadow of them self from a human..

[12:14:03] <Ninetails> As such there's no universal level which could erect an adequate layer of minimum receptive intelligence related "what's part of a show and what's reality?" - heck, they are not even able to do it in their own societies successfully.

[12:16:30] <Ninetails> One could as well declare that a maggot and a hedgehog both fail at simple tasks of self control while it depends purely on the character and experiences of the individuals. As such the applying of a turing test to random humans (instead of any AI) might yield in a very spectacular amount of failures. Are those humans as such not longer human?

[12:34:06] <Berlin36> damn, what about 36 sleep and 12 to be active?
[12:34:10] <Ninetails> Why having hours at all? Let's just be active if people are rested and wake up stress-free and well-chilled from a long nap without alarm.
[12:34:23] <Bco1981> Berlin36: you will find out when you get older.
[12:34:36] <Berlin36> hmmm
[12:34:45] <Berlin36> all i know is that sleep = good
[12:34:56] <Bco1981> yes, but not just any sleep
[12:35:30] <Bco1981> go to bed at the same time... every day.
[12:35:34] <Ninetails> Sleep is basically a time warp portal which sets you some hours nearer to your death. Hooray.
[12:35:48] <Ninetails> And yet it feels such comfy. While death doesn't. Dang.
[12:36:01] <Berlin36> how do you know
[12:36:11] <Berlin36> maybe death is much more comfortable
[12:36:15] <Bco1981> death it self isn't bad. it's the pain to get there.
[12:36:19] <Ninetails> Was there multiple times, how else would one know?
[12:36:29] <Berlin36> :O
[12:37:23] <Ninetails> As long as you have the time and abilities to use your brains capacity just before (or while) cell death, all you want is to enjoy life. That's the one goal not eradicate-able from your brain.
[12:37:50] <Berlin36> yee
[12:37:53] <Ninetails> Nothing you could select willingly. If you die while sleeping, then there's no real time to think about it, tho.
[12:37:53] <Berlin36> love life
[12:38:17] <Berlin36> sometimes these thought can create some existential crisis
[12:38:43] <Ninetails> Same goes with spontaneous or very quick deaths. But most deaths take longer than just a half second to sustain and that's enough for you to wish and try everything to get back into life. *shrugs*
[12:39:02] <Berlin36> *shrugs too*
[12:40:00] <Ninetails> And it's not even as if I were suicidal or searching death, I actually love life and enjoy it. But with some illnesses you can quite easily die from a small fault or unforeseen consequences.
[12:40:02] <Berlin36> i'd rather die by old age in a house on some field surrounded by birds and grass and trees or sum shit

[12:42:35] <Ninetails> But one thing I never saw: anything beyond. Dang, hm? Either "on" or "off", that's it. Quite binary. As long as something "works", the thoughts "work" and your ears (as those almost never shut off, interestingly every other sense fails beforehand due to nutritious starving of the relevant nervous systems and organs) work quite clearly, you'll just
[12:42:35] <Ninetails> experience something. Or you won't.

[17:21:18] <MootPoot> but also emmeka what price tag are you even looking at
[17:21:38] <MootPoot> afaik last I checked if you can go without a dedicated gpu - fairly good box for about 800
[17:21:49] <emmeka> like if I was to get everything exactly the way I wanted it, with some new monitors and a fancy keyboard the way I'd like it and so on so forth, I'd probably be staring down $4k? and like that's an absurd amount of disposable income
[17:22:01] <emmeka> to me, at least.
[17:22:06] <MootPoot> my personal system is like over 5 or 5.5k
[17:22:12] <MootPoot> and I have a few other computers as well
[17:22:20] <MootPoot> maybe 8k or 9 all in
[17:22:22] <death916> 4k is way too high
[17:22:29] <emmeka> mmm I'd believe it, but I'm quite alright with 1080p60
[17:22:31] <death916> uc an build somethign top of the line with liek 2k
[17:22:39] <death916> well not couhnting gpus rn
[17:22:43] <MootPoot> emmeka: I just built it up over time - getting one thing at a time
[17:22:47] <MootPoot> I didn't blow it all at once
[17:22:53] <death916> ya add a piece ehre n there
[17:22:54] <emmeka> death916 "not counting the GPU" lol
[17:22:56] <MootPoot> wait for sales, buy slowly, upgrade as I go along

[17:23:23] <MootPoot> you can probably get along with a good iGPU
[17:23:29] <emmeka> death916 but anyway that estimate was including things like building my own keyboard with custom keycaps, more nicer monitors, proper monitor stands, so on.
[17:23:30] <death916> everythign in my pc is new cept my 1080 
[17:23:36] <emmeka> MootPoot I know.
[17:23:48] <emmeka> I *could* buy a 5700G and it'd be like, functional as a desktop
[17:23:50] <death916> naw buiulding ur own kb adds alot
[17:23:59] <MootPoot> yeah, pretty much
[17:24:11] <emmeka> death916 right, it does, but I type with a pretty niche layout.
[17:24:44] <death916> what u do is get a base nice cpu mobo ram
[17:24:50] <death916> at least one monitor
[17:24:54] <death916> then add a monitor and good gpu
[17:24:55] <MootPoot> if it helps - my current build has just been slowly upgrading and carrying foreword parts since like 2017 emmeka 
[17:24:56] <death916> then kb
[17:24:59] <death916> when u ghave mor emoney
[17:25:09] <MootPoot> no way in fuck could I drop this much cash instantly
[17:25:22] <death916> same MootPoot my build is from about 2017
[17:25:23] <emmeka> I have a monitor and a PC that works fine etc etc and I'm not going to do that, death916
[17:25:27] <death916> or whenever 1080 came out
[17:25:36] <death916> then ur basically haldway there
[17:25:39] <death916> half
[17:25:42] <emmeka> not really.
[17:25:54] <MootPoot> fortunately gpu prices are going back to normal 
[17:25:57] <death916> is itr ddr4
[17:26:00] <emmeka> I've seen that, MootPoot
[17:26:06] <emmeka> death916 no. it's ancient.
[17:26:09] <death916> ah
[17:26:12] <Bco1981> buy a part here and there. and then put together when you have the main components
[17:26:18] <MootPoot> ^
[17:26:29] <emmeka> Bco1981 by the time I'd succeed at that, it'd be out of date :P
[17:26:30] <MootPoot> get a ddr5 platform now - then just slowly part it together
[17:26:44] <MootPoot> emmeka: listen..with computers - everything is out of date every 5 seconds
[17:26:50] <Bco1981> emmeka: but, much more recent then that apu you are rockin'
[17:26:50] <emmeka> sure.
[17:26:59] <MootPoot> forget about things like staying upto date or future proofing
[17:27:06] <MootPoot> even my system is out of date
[17:27:10] <emmeka> look I'm not saying I can't build a PC and I wasn't asking for advice with my finances, lol

[17:27:29] * MootPoot pats emmeka 
[17:27:41] <MootPoot> There there. Life hard. PC expensive.
[17:27:45] <emmeka> I just want to shout into the void about how people seem to be able to spend more money than me and it baffles me
[17:28:34] <MootPoot> the secret is not having a happy married life emmeka 
[17:28:41] <MootPoot> and just be a basement dweller
[17:28:49] <emmeka> probably
[17:29:04] <Bco1981> somebody called ?
[17:29:11] <emmeka> my wife's medical expenses are a major bill for us, afterall
[17:29:21] <emmeka> but my housing costs are very low for a millenial, so
[17:29:28] <MootPoot> my housing costs are 0
[17:29:33] <emmeka> that does help.

[17:31:21] <MootPoot> very low fixed costs seem to be the meta now

[17:31:38] <death916> its 2022 everyoens broke
[17:31:56] <death916> everytiome i get a raise im somehow jsut as broke
[17:32:06] <emmeka> MootPoot but to the $50/month thing, I don't tend to differentiate savings based on purpose, because when you own a home and shit occasionally random expenses happen where it's like, hi, here's something that costs $6000 and you need to do it right now. So I sort of need that slush fund to just be there, and the way I go about things is that whenever that slush fund surpasses a specific amount, it goes against debt.
[17:32:48] <MootPoot> Mmm
[17:33:07] <MootPoot> But sometimes with large things you want you do have to make it a separate thing 
[17:33:12] <emmeka> result of this I guess is that my savings are reasonably lean, but my debt is very low for someone of my position, so I guess the lack of disposable income to throw at shit is my fault in a way
[17:34:01] <amigojapan> MootPoot: 600 USD is enough for a new PC for you?
[17:34:03] <MootPoot> Speaking of money EI is still dragging their ass

[17:35:13] <MootPoot> amigojapan: oh you mean like that 
[17:35:19] <amigojapan> Yes
[17:35:24] <MootPoot> No nowadays I just incrementally upgrade 
[17:35:33] <emmeka> well presumably you don't buy a new PC in its entirety every 12 months, amigojapan
[17:35:36] <amigojapan> Ah ok
[17:35:47] <MootPoot> So when I upgrade a part its usually about that much and I take it out of the savings box 
[17:35:49] <amigojapan> I see emmeka
[17:36:30] <MootPoot> Aside from Gpu upgrades I plan to use my current pc in its current state until at least 2025
[17:36:42] <MootPoot> Hopefully I can stretch it out longer 
[17:36:51] <emmeka> MootPoot part of me is really debt averse, like I understand on some level that I'm under-leveraged and that with my assets I could take on more debt and it'd be basically no big deal with inflation being the way it is, but I desperately try to pay down everything quickly
[17:37:03] <MootPoot> Mmm
[17:37:06] <MootPoot> I have that too 
[17:37:21] <emmeka> I don't like fucking over future emmeka
[17:37:24] <MootPoot> I don't like taking on overbearing debt I need to keep thinking about

[17:39:08] <emmeka> grand total right now for me is... $70k, including mortgage, what's left of the car payment, and what's on the line of credit. Which is kind of peanuts considering my assets.
[17:39:37] <death916> not bad with a mortgage
[17:39:46] <emmeka> part of me just wants to aggressively eradicate all of it and be free, even though I know it's fine
[17:39:59] <emmeka> like the mortgage is half the rate of inflation, so who cares?
[17:40:03] <emmeka> but I care anyway...
[17:40:18] <MootPoot> emmeka: that's also a big reason why I'm just putting off my student loans
[17:40:27] <MootPoot> they are interest free for a few years still
[17:40:33] <MootPoot> why even bother and pay less later

[19:41:40] <MootPoot> it takes me about 10min to cook most meals
[19:41:45] <MootPoot> usually even less
[19:42:04] <MootPoot> since most of my meals are oven-based , I just put stuff on the pan, pop it in, and set a timer for 30min or whatever

[19:42:57] <MootPoot> when I buy groceries I might spend 30min doing a little prep but after that the longest amount of time I spend in the kitchen is like 15min tops

[19:43:48] <MootPoot> my last meal was chicken breast sandwiches - 2 min to walk to the kitchen and pop it in, come back in 30min, 2min to warm some bread, 3 min to put the sandwich together and I can now eat
[19:44:06] <MootPoot> total personal time taken was maybe 10 mins max - including going to the kitchen
[19:44:08] <Bco1981> the week with the kids i do some quick dishes, like tomato soup with some soup pasta and meatballs
[19:44:16] <Zoidberg> Bco1981: plain rye bread?

[19:44:36] <MootPoot> ah
[19:45:27] <Bco1981> then spaghetti and meatsauce
[19:46:21] <MootPoot> Other meals might be just some fried eggs or something which is 10 min tops as well

[21:31:43] <Aurora_v_kosmose> > though Aurora wouldn't recommend quicklisp | Yeah. I greatly dislike quicklisp's stance on transport security & authentication. The sacrifice of Lisp purism for the pragmatic take of Guix makes more sense to me.
[21:31:58] <Aurora_v_kosmose> (And technically Guix is implemented mostly in a Lisp, but that's still not CL)
[21:32:41] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Guix is also simply better-engineered and easier to contribute to, modify to your liking or add internal projects & channels to.
[21:33:37] <Aurora_v_kosmose> A shim interface to use Guix from CL seamlessly would be welcome, however.
[21:33:44] <Aeres> Aurora_v_kosmose: does it have lots of libs? or is it mostly from the bottom up? 
[21:33:57] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Aeres: There's significantly more CL libraries packaged in Guix than Quicklisp.
[21:34:23] <Aeres> also is there any way I can deal with bignums properly in lisp, mostly python is sucking ass with bignums for RSA and stuffs, and it becomes very painful to work with python for Crypto challenges

[21:38:28] <Aurora_v_kosmose> The Integer class describes the relation. 
[21:39:35] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Aeres: The main difficulty with Guix is the lack of direct interface from Common Lisp for it, and that if you want to add libraries you have to learn how to package for Guix instead of just sending a link & title in an email to the quicklisp maintainer.
[21:39:52] <Aurora_v_kosmose> The first is the only point I consider legitimate.
[21:40:06] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Because the second pays for itself in benefits once you've learned it.
[21:40:43] * Aeres is scared because lisp is not going to be a smooth sail
[21:41:01] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Being able to reliably test builds and using Guix for aiding development of just about anything is great.
[21:42:46] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Aeres: Like most large languages, it takes some time to get comfortable. You'll pick up more as you use it.
[21:42:59] <Aeres> let's see, so my plan of action is going to be like: 1. Study Sicp 2. use a bit of sbcl to properly hate/love it 3. (if (hate 2) 4 2) 4. Use guix 
[21:43:24] <Aurora_v_kosmose> SICP is not a Common Lisp or Lisp book. It just incidentally uses Lisp as its language.
[21:43:35] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Don't confuse its difficulty with the difficulty of Lisps.
[21:43:43] <Aurora_v_kosmose> It's a computer science textbook first & foremost.
[21:43:46] <Aeres> wait its difficult book? 
[21:43:59] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Aeres: It's more difficult than merely learning a programming language, yes.
[21:44:08] <Aeres> ahh yes yes 
[21:44:39] <Aeres> learning is confusing, I had started out with practical projects in lisp and it bored me, because I was writing something that I would never really use 
[21:44:51] <Aeres> lisp is more methodical, so makes me feel more comitted to it 
[21:44:51] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Then it wasn't so practical, was it? :p

[22:57:36] <ButterNoodle> *not on a gaming board tho
[22:57:46] <emmeka> ButterNoodle yeah but DVI-I is VGA/DVI combined, so
[22:57:53] <emmeka> analog and digital on one port
[22:58:08] <Bco1981> ButterNoodle: lol yeah i didn't notice all those I/O options. the weird thing is the spdif near video outputs. and not near audio outputs.
[22:58:31] <ButterNoodle> true.. if I could only pick on dvi can do what I need
[22:58:45] <ButterNoodle> so many different fucking cables...
[22:58:51] <Ninetails> There was a time where digital devices with HDMI or DVI didn't have audio lines for digital audio used quite often.
[22:58:53] <ButterNoodle> vga is just vga
[22:59:35] <ButterNoodle> I have dvi - hdmi, dvi - vga, dvi - dp, dp - hdmi.. and so on..
[22:59:42] <MootPoot> ButterNoodle: 
[22:59:47] <emmeka> and really why have DVI at all, HDMI is backwards and forwards compatible with it, and displayport is I think backwards compatible? I don't remember the order. You can either plug a displayport output into a DVI input, or a DVI output into a displayport input, but not both.
[22:59:48] <ButterNoodle> never the one I need when I need  it tho
[22:59:50] <MootPoot> I require some info
[22:59:56] <Ninetails> As such they were connected with an additional copper or TOSlink one. In the beginning of Dolby Digital and such this was as well often used to separate specific hardware decoders from the video device.
[22:59:59] <ButterNoodle> amazon basics has taken lots of my monies
[23:00:02] <MootPoot> can you boost cable signal bidirectionally?
[23:00:03] <ButterNoodle> waddup MootPoot 
[23:00:05] <MootPoot> coax
[23:00:27] <MootPoot> specifically for my cable internet
[23:00:32] <ButterNoodle> uhhh yes, but I am not aware of a bi-di amp that does that
[23:00:37] <emmeka> Ninetails DVI doesn't support audio at all, even
[23:00:42] <ButterNoodle> why?
[23:01:07] <MootPoot> TLDR : cable guy came over - basically the upstream connection from modem to their shit is just baaaaaaaaaarely enough for them to not give a shit about enything
[23:01:15] <emmeka> so an additional audio connection was necessary, but toslink was high end shit in DVI times...
[23:01:16] <MootPoot> and just told me to not use moca/splitters
[23:01:18] <MootPoot> and left
[23:01:23] <ButterNoodle> I'd agree
[23:01:27] <MootPoot> but I need those
[23:01:29] <ButterNoodle> isolate ur moca
[23:01:48] <MootPoot> I only have one set of coax running tho

[23:02:05] <ButterNoodle> :|
[23:02:17] <ButterNoodle> they can fix the downstream
[23:02:20] <ButterNoodle> just not the up
[23:02:29] <Ninetails> emmeka : That's possible, was long ago that I used it. The digital standards as DP / HDMI fortunately do support it. It was quite a mess if one had a separate decoder unit before the loudspeakers, not to talk about thick cables. With USB-C 40 GBit cable and integrated Displayport it's as easy as it could get.
[23:02:50] <ButterNoodle> and that attenuateor for ur moca probably has some losses on the line as well

[23:05:45] <ButterNoodle> ^I used one of those before
[23:06:36] <ButterNoodle> you will probably get a call from catv tech saying ur sending RF to the space station
[23:06:51] <Ninetails> emmeka : It is optocoupled, no feedback or interference through electromagnetic waves is a good thing, but most TOSlink D/A converters and OpAmps ain't really high quality in customer devices, as such it's well possible that the "separated" decoding and processing sounds even worse than analogue audio. It depends more on the quality of the
[23:06:52] <Ninetails> components used in amplifier / sound system.
[23:07:06] <MootPoot> seems like I can't use that one - docsis return freq maxes at like 100mhz

[23:07:23] <ButterNoodle> ic
[23:07:43] <ButterNoodle> *they do exist
[23:07:50] <ButterNoodle> just have to do some research
[23:08:42] <emmeka> Ninetails but you're still doing digital to analog conversion the same way with HDMI/DP, so it's superior to those in all ways
[23:09:25] <MootPoot> well, he did some adjustments outdoors as well
[23:09:40] <emmeka> really, there's digital to analog conversion happening somewhere now always, and most everything off the shelf is pretty good at it these days
[23:09:40] <MootPoot> when he originally came in he said the outdoor cable was kinda wonk as well
[23:09:59] <MootPoot> but after that he came in and kept on going on about the moca I have
[23:10:04] <MootPoot> he didn't really get how it worked
[23:10:48] <vegii> konnichiwa
[23:12:36] <Ninetails> emmeka : to extract the digital audio out of an HDMI connection fortunately doesn't need any D/A processing, as such it can (if the components do a good work) stay the same quality while getting handled. Same goes for digital multi channel streams. The OpAmp and output on the speakers surely needs D/A conversion, that's true.

[23:14:32] <Ninetails> But regarding the sound quality I don't see anymore the high interest into it in terms of consumer electronics / informatics. It's quite sad, there were high quality soundcards with even socketed OpAmps and high quality caps not many years ago. Nowadays many use headphones with integrated ICs / amplifiers, so the difference is quite intense.
[23:15:26] <Ninetails> if a high quality amplifier gets used and the whole signal processing is digitally, it doesn't matter much, then just the amplifier and loudspeaker setup counts.
[23:16:00] <emmeka> well, nowadays you don't need high quality soundcards, because most boards do it good on their own and also most people who care will run digital audio to whatever their setup is instead of letting the PC do digital/analog conversion.

[23:17:27] <emmeka> vegii no. it was designed for that, but toslink is just SPDIF and can do higher sampling rates fine.
[23:17:37] <emmeka> 48khz is DVDs, 44.1khz is CDs
[23:17:49] <emmeka> why are there two different standards? because fuck you, that's why
[23:18:11] <vegii> > two channels of uncompressed lossless pulse-code modulated (PCM) audio or compressed 5.1/7.1 surround sound such as Dolby Digital or DTS Surround System. Unlike HDMI, TOSLINK does not have the bandwidth to carry the lossless versions of Dolby TrueHD, DTS-HD Master Audio, or more than two channels of PCM audio. 
[23:18:33] <emmeka> right, toslink can't carry PCM surround sound
[23:18:48] <emmeka> but it can carry high res stereo
[23:18:53] <Ninetails> emmeka : it depends, if - what I see most of the time in younger groups - headphones are either analogue coupled or over USB / internal D/A conversion, that's not nearly comparable to plugging an adequate headset to a separate, high quality sound card. Those onboard solutions ain't high quality, but for digital procession it doesn't matter much
[23:18:53] <Ninetails> (aside very tiny latency differences which don't play a role most of the time).
[23:18:54] <emmeka> if you care about such things

[23:19:27] <vegii> I don't think it's common to use it for more than 48kHz 20 bit
[23:19:44] <vegii> and I don't think 20 bit is hires by today's standards
[23:20:11] <emmeka> Ninetails the thing to do for people who care these days is to get a high quality external DAC/headphone amp combo, have the PC feed it digital audio over like USB or SPDIF, and then that's that.
[23:20:24] <emmeka> vegii sure it is.
[23:21:06] <vegii> meh ok
[23:21:19] <emmeka> in fact it's basically the usual way to connect like 96khz 24 bit
[23:21:48] <emmeka> but this isn't important anyway
[23:22:11] <emmeka> sample rates are bullshit you can't hear frequencies above like idk 40khz

[23:22:52] <Ninetails> emmeka : Hmm, if those "gamer" headsets were of high sound quality, I would agree. But it hardly reaches a 80 $ Sennheiser analogue headset. Not that it matters for many of the users, but at the end the light effects cost more than the actual sound quality. :-)
[23:23:29] <emmeka> Ninetails I have a Sennheiser headset, but with a built-in DAC and it's wired up toslink. It's superior to the analog audio I could feed it.
[23:25:10] <emmeka> vegii or I guess I mean you can't hear frequencies above 20khz. I think the way it works is that sound possible to reproduce = 1/2 * sample rate frequency
[23:25:11] <lastonestanding> why not 44.1?
[23:25:13] <Ninetails> That's understandable, one signal conversion less. Sennheiser uses acceptable chipsets instead of "let's save 20 cents and get the cheapest crap which just boosts bass or allows equalizing (and as such even more falsifying) of a mediocre resulting sound quality!" like many of the gamer models.
[23:25:44] <lastonestanding> isn't the internet build around 44.1?
[23:25:51] <lastonestanding> well, I mean optimized
[23:26:01] <emmeka> lastonestanding chances are your PC is outputting 48khz, not 44.1.
[23:26:08] <MootPoot> The thing with the gamer headsets is that they are shit...unless they are the wireless ones - in which case they are still shit - but your only option for low latency audio
[23:26:13] <MootPoot> wireless low latency*
[23:26:30] <emmeka> lastonestanding but it doesn't matter. both are equally fine, and just different standards used by different things.
[23:26:41] <lastonestanding> emmeka: but how? I set it to 24bit 44.1khz
[23:26:52] <emmeka> well, then it's outputting 44.1
[23:27:07] <emmeka> but most anime rips you're watching are probably in 48khz so
[23:27:20] <emmeka> it's just doing sample rate conversion which is unnecessary?
[23:27:41] <Ninetails> MootPoot : There exists the possibility to use dedicated wireless modules
[23:27:58] <lastonestanding> what you mean unnecessary?
[23:28:02] <Ninetails> But those are either in bad quality or expensive (with 200 bucks+ per module) and annoying in the pocket, hehe.
[23:28:10] <lastonestanding> watching anime is a waste of energy to begin with
[23:28:42] <lastonestanding> or you mean the conversion makes the sound worse?
[23:28:45] <Ninetails> Nah, anime is the most chilling way to die by doing nothing and in a state of bliss. Not even drugs reach this without side effects, wonderful. :-P
[23:29:37] <emmeka> lastonestanding it probably doesn't affect the sound quality substantially no, your hearing is not capable of detecting the loss of the 22-24khz frequency range anyway
[23:29:54] *** Joins: The_Blode (~Blode@user/the-blode/x-7164444)
[23:30:21] <emmeka> it's just not necessary because your PC can probably output 48khz, and whatever's receiving it can accept 48khz, so why force 44.1 unless you listen to a lot of CD rips?

[23:32:30] <lastonestanding> because I use the internet
[23:32:52] <lastonestanding> also, why is this shit not dynamically changed?!
[23:32:55] <Ninetails> The differences in higher frequency bandwidth are less for the direct hearing, that would be topped above 5 to 12 kHz for older people and most of it takes place below 3 kHz.
[23:33:25] <lastonestanding> the bits and khzs
[23:33:25] <vegii> lastonestanding: because it's simplex communication
[23:33:47] <Ninetails> But it gives more room for the ICs to analyze if the "noises" are actually something wanted or some disturbance by raising the area of focus. Doesn't matter much, tho.
[23:33:49] *** Joins: chuudoku (~chuudoku@72.95.253.19)
[23:34:12] <vegii> so the sender can't tell if the receiver is able to interpret different sampling rate etc.
[23:36:03] <lastonestanding> "Just select 44.1KHz at 16bit and dont think about it. Its native for most of the content (games, CDs, streams)."
[23:36:21] <lastonestanding> should I go back to 16 instead of 24?
[23:36:56] <vegii> lastonestanding: yes, games like heroes of might and magic 2
[23:37:07] <Ninetails> Phones used just around 1800 Hz for years and sounded crappy, but well understanding for the human vocal language. With ten times that frequency bandwidth most wouldn't hear any difference by further raising it anymore. Some sound systems could reproduce the frequencies and generate some sort of subconscious reception by the physical outcome (as
[23:37:07] <Ninetails> example if things vibrate in this frequency, you might "feel" that there is something vibrating due to the mechanical contact).
[23:38:00] <Ninetails> But in regards of clear audio quality much, very much money is made by ghost stories, hehe.
[23:38:00] <vegii> tf you talking bro
[23:38:50] <emmeka> lastonestanding it doesn't matter, 24 bit can reproduce everything 16 bit can accurately, so there's no harm. Your PC is just converting it for you, and probably doing fine at it, it's trivial.
[23:39:34] <vegii> just fill the more significant bits with zeros
[23:39:40] <vegii> raise the volume
[23:39:59] <vegii> or do range conversion
[23:40:04] <vegii> get rounding errors
[23:40:05] <Ninetails> "Hey, see this 100% oxygen free copper wire with single-strain pure gold coating, twice mylar reinforced, seven times shielded, it will make your 300$ sound system sound the *best* it could!" - and only costs 299,95 $ itself, d'Oh.
[23:41:04] <Ninetails> (Gold coating is great against oxidation and losses on the contacts / connectors, but gold has quite a high electrical resistance .. which makes it aside the oxidation prevention a pretty bad material for this task.)
[23:41:09] <vegii> on that note, class D amps are surprisingly good nowadays 
[23:41:12] <lastonestanding> interesting
[23:41:52] <lastonestanding> why is audio is so complex and hardly anyone can tell the difference anyway?
[23:42:15] <lastonestanding> it's not like video where you have a clear visual
[23:43:33] <Ninetails> Humans are not made to be focused on acoustic details aside those frequencies mostly occurring by communicating animals (including humans) and the physical results of their living styles. The frequency recognizable clearly is quite low compared to many animals.
[23:43:52] <Ninetails> As such some animals would be able to recognize the differences very clearly - but just don't care.
[23:46:27] <vegii> so my cat can tell the difference in audio cables but doesn't care
[23:46:31] <vegii> I believe you
[23:46:46] <Ninetails> Not in "ghost magic" products but in the actual outcome, yes.
[23:47:17] <Ninetails> And it as well is limited to specific (specialized) frequency bandwidth areas. They don't hear "all" frequencies well.
[23:48:03] <vegii> I have a bit of 2-component glue left over
[23:48:05] <vegii> wat do
[23:48:25] <vegii> law of the instrument
[23:48:54] <DaPinkOne> Aeres, if you liked DS3, elden ring's out and it's pretty good so far
[23:49:12] <Ninetails> Do you have any tool which got loose and needs a fix? Hammer head, a chipped wooden stick?
[23:49:35] <Ninetails> Or any PCB which could use a water proof encapsulation on the parts?
[23:49:47] <MootPoot> I wonder
[23:50:12] <bxgelsan> o.o
[23:50:14] <MootPoot> ButterNoodle: is a 5 port coax splitter with only 2 ports used but the others terminated as good as a 3 port splitter with all ports in use?
[23:50:31] <Ninetails> Or mix it with wooden saw dust of the same color and place it as a self made putty in chipped or damaged wooden furniture, then wait until it's hard and sand it down, coat with wooden oil and it's like new.
[23:50:46] <bxgelsan> MootPoot: i had a weird experience. i just opened a box to get my rpi400, thought i had 2.
[23:50:51] <bxgelsan> realized the other was a keyboard.
[23:50:53] <bxgelsan> ;_;
[23:52:59] <MootPoot> you actually bought the 400?
[23:53:01] <MootPoot> why
[23:53:08] <MootPoot> its such bad value for money
