[21:20:01] <pranavats> borodust: I wonder if you considered other renderers like Ogre for alien-works, other than filament.
[21:39:00] <borodust> pranavats: i did, but no
[21:39:22] <pranavats> I see. Any particular reason you decided against it?
[21:42:40] <borodust> i don't actually remember why i went with filament it was quite a bit ago :)
[21:43:06] <borodust> filament was hitting all points i needed from rendering engine
[21:43:37] <borodust> only rendering, cross platform (including mobile), PBR-capable, easily shippable, clean interface
[21:44:21] <borodust> as a bonus: Vulkan/Metal support
[21:45:42] <pranavats> I was asking in case there are any technical difficulties you foresaw with Ogre in particular.
[21:47:18] <borodust> no, i didn't attempt to use ogre at all
[21:48:23] <borodust> can you use ogre as a shared library only for rendering?
[21:48:41] <pranavats> I've been looking into it since this morning and except ease of shipping and the interface clarity (which I don't know about), it does seem to support all those things as well. Of course one renderer is enough work for proof of concept.
[21:49:38] <pranavats> I don't yet have any experience with it, but it looks like the 1.x branch is designed for just that.
[21:49:55] <borodust> i see
[21:50:46] <pranavats> There already are bindings to Ogre 1.6.4.2 (latest being 1.12.something)
[21:51:01] <pranavats> Okra package provides bindings for that.
[21:51:17] <pranavats> Last commit was a decade ago.
[21:52:07] <pranavats> Ogre-next (2.x) branch provides support for Vulkan and Metal.
[21:52:59] <borodust> yeh, maybe it catched up since i last looked at it, but that train has left ;p
[21:53:19] <pranavats> I understand.
[21:54:28] <borodust> filament is a perfect fit - it does exactly what i want it to and sometimes even more
[21:54:43] <borodust> i'm not planning to replace it anytime soon
[21:55:00] <borodust> alien-works also won't have switchable parts
[21:55:09] <pranavats> I'd be looking forward to how it goes.
[21:55:44] <borodust> yeh, me also xD
[21:55:46] <pranavats> Oh, that's a bummer...can't use another renderer with it.
[21:56:04] <borodust> yup
[21:56:37] <pranavats> I was thinking of using claw to play with Ogre in Lisp. I can still do that, but would have been fun if I could use it with aw.
[21:56:47] <borodust> i tried that approach allowing switching underlying systems and i didn't like it at all
[21:57:22] <pranavats> Hm..
[21:59:27] <pranavats> Would that approach get in the way of performance?
[22:00:36] <borodust> yeh
[22:00:45] <borodust> exactly
[22:01:10] <borodust> that's why i ditched it for alien-works and gonna all underlying systems as tightly as possible
[22:01:21] <borodust> *gonna bind
[22:01:59] <borodust> i was experimenting with switchable subsystems in cl-bodge
[22:02:03] <borodust> physics in particular
[22:02:50] <pranavats> It's for the best, I hope.
[22:02:50] <borodust> box2d/chipmunk, ode/newton
[22:03:02] <borodust> but that get out of hand very quickly
[22:03:05] <borodust> *got out
[22:03:40] <pranavats> Oh...
[22:04:04] <borodust> if alien-works go anywhere, it will evolve from version to version
[22:04:31] <borodust> like if something goes bad with filament and it goes abandoned, i can switch to something else in a next version of aw :)
[22:05:00] <borodust> maybe with breaking API changes, whatever
[22:05:29] <pranavats> Sure. I'll checkout Filament as well.
