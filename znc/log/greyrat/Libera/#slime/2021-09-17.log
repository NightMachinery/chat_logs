[20:02:56] <gendl> Hi, apparently it's not possible to create a "compile-bundle" for swank with asdf?  `(asdf:operate 'asdf:compile-bundle-op :swank)` does produce a `swank-system.fasl`, but then simply loading this into a freshly started vanilla CL image does not make it possible to do `(swank:create-server :port  ...)`
[20:05:34] <gendl> so in order to initialize swank you pretty much have to use `swank-loader.lisp` is that right? 
[20:37:25] <luis`> Yes. One could argue that's a feature since swank server and slime client are somewhat tied together. But doing a proper ASDF system is a long-standing issue 
[20:43:17] <gendl> I'm trying to make a container image which starts up with a swank listener from the get-go, then one can connect with `M-x slime-connect` from a properly configured emacs (that's my plan anyway)
[20:43:42] <gendl> also could configure emacs itself to spin up the container I suppose
[20:58:31] <gendl> so to load just swank, without asdf or Quicklisp, but I know the path to `swank-loader.lisp` what should I do? 
[20:58:43] <gendl> first, load the `swank-loader.lisp` 
[20:58:57] <gendl> then, just call `(swank::loadup)`  ? 
[20:59:39] <gendl> or `(swank:init)` ?
[21:00:31] <gendl> sorry -- `(swank-loader:init)`   ? 
[21:00:57] <gendl> ... it seems that's the ticket... trying now..
[21:15:29] <luis`> start-swank.lisp contains the full recipe 
[22:44:57] <gendl> ah ok just saw this 
[22:45:45] <gendl> I tried `(swank-loader:init)` but when connecting I get: `Error running timer \`slime-process-available-input\`: (error "Selecting deleted buffer")`
[22:49:08] <gendl> does swank need its source code to be available to run properly or something? 
[22:51:10] <gendl> actually that error is a secondary error. before that is "The lisp connection disappeared unexpectedly"
[22:51:18] <gendl> (or similar)
[22:55:11] <gendl> Punting and just trying it by loading `start-swank.lisp`at startup time with the whole source code available..
[23:02:51] *** Quits: minion (~minion@common-lisp.net) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[23:03:50] *** Joins: minion (~minion@common-lisp.net)
[23:29:38] <gendl> ok I think I'm getting close! Connection is being made from emacs running in my host thru to swank in the container!
[23:29:48] <gendl> But, the Lisp is exiting when we get an error
[23:30:19] <gendl> oh wait that might be my bad -- I think I'm starting the Lisp with that switch set - to exit on error... 
[23:30:53] <gendl> I'll try to be quieter in here as I suspect this channel is more for slime/swank dev than noob support!
[23:30:55] <gendl> ? 
[23:41:25] <gendl> ok.. I'm in business thanks! 
[23:41:25] <gendl> I can confirm that swank sources apparently are necessary for connecting with `slime-connect` but I might play with it and see how all necessary stuff can be built into the saved image and not depend on source code being there at runtime (although there's no real reason not to have the sources available with the built distribution anyway). 
[23:42:08] <gendl> anyway I have a REPL into my image and the debugger is working so I'm  a happy camper. Thank you for all your work on Slime/Swank!
