[00:12:18] <AsenMx> Hello, I have technical AWS question if you guys don't mind. I want main domain to point out to a cloudfront, but since main domain is not on AWS any way to do that easily? I was thinking of having main domain point to a webserver that redirect domain.com to www.domain.com. And to have www.domain.com be a Cname to a cloudfront. Any more elegant way to do this?
[00:25:36] <slaughter> I think even in AWS you do domain.com -> S3 bucket that redirects to www -> www is a cname to cloudfront
[00:25:57] <slaughter> Which is to say, no I don't think there's a more elegant way
[00:26:09] <slaughter> Unless you just drop www entirely
[00:32:33] <AsenMx> slaughter, why s3 bucket? can i make A record to the s3 bucket? Does  the ip of s3 bucket ever change?
[00:34:09] <slaughter> Just a quick and easy way to handle redirects to www without a webserver
[00:34:43] <slaughter> I don't know about the IP part there, I have never done this outside AWS so haven't had to look into that
[00:35:50] <AsenMx> yeah s3 doesn't support https reddirects which can be tricky
[00:40:02] <slaughter> How so?
[00:40:16] <slaughter> Cloudfront can handle that fine
[00:40:34] <AsenMx> I have no way to route main domain to cloudfront
[00:40:38] <AsenMx> that is my whole problem
[00:45:40] <slaughter> What about the config you laid out there
[00:45:47] <slaughter> domain -> www.domain -> cloudfront
[00:46:23] <slaughter> Oh I said "unless you drop WWW" haha. That would be more _elegant_ but probably not helpful in this case
[00:47:13] <AsenMx> yeah  domain.com > www.domain.com > cloudfront would work but the solution looks something like that. my only option is foo.com > NLB (with static ip) > ec2 > redirect to www.foo.com > CNAME to cloudfront > actual content. 
[00:53:09] <slaughter> Why do you have to have the NLB/ec2 for just that simple redirect? 
[00:53:21] <slaughter> IE why can't you do the S3 bucket trick I mentioned?
[00:55:18] <AsenMx> because it only works for http 
[00:55:48] <AsenMx> for https i need cloudfront and i have no way to route from main domain to a cloudfront as this requires CNAME record and APEX domains don't support CNAME records
[01:03:51] <slaughter> Not entirely sure I follow - it redirects to HTTP but cloudfront can accept both OR even redirect http to https - is there something lost in an http redirect for you where it _must_ redirect to HTTPS?
[01:05:49] <slaughter> We have a working high volume ecomm configuration using the above. domain.com points to the S3 bucket, which redirects to www.domain.com which is a CNAME to Cloudfront which (in our case) accepts both (though I've not seen a browser use HTTP when testing it).
[01:21:37] <AsenMx> and how does domain.com points to s3?
[01:23:46] <AsenMx> s3 ips change constantly so you can't really have A record pointing to s3
[01:26:36] <slaughter> That's what I get for talking while I work - multitasking is a lie! Yeah nevermind me, you're on the right
[01:27:47] <AsenMx> heh I was secretly hoping there is a way to do that easily
[01:31:24] <AsenMx> any easy way to replicate infrastructure from one AWS region to another? Without having it terraformed before?

[01:33:32] <AsenMx> kwilczynski, exactly 
[01:34:33] <kwilczynski> Yes.
[01:34:45] <kwilczynski> We call it *magic* :)
[01:35:33] <kwilczynski> Look for Octarine-coloured button in AWS web UI. It'll do the trick.
[01:35:34] <kwilczynski> :)
[01:36:05] <AsenMx> hmm?
[01:36:14] <slaughter> I'm laughing, but I know the joke there
[01:36:20] <kwilczynski> :)
[01:37:01] <AsenMx> yeah i know about wizzard color and magic shit yet i'm hoping for real solution 
[01:37:27] <kwilczynski> AsenMx: Being serious. DR planning is often non-trivial.
[01:37:54] <kwilczynski> AsenMx: And if you have data coming all the time, then the challenge goes up a notch.
[01:38:13] <kwilczynski> AsenMx: There is nothing automatic to do it currently. Terraform or not.
[01:39:22] <kwilczynski> If you have budget for the infrastructure, then you can keep A and B running and fail-over between them regularly. It can be a nice test of platform/services resiliency too.

[01:40:01] <slaughter> AsenMx I love you - "wizzard color and magic shit" got me good
[01:40:01] <kwilczynski> There many way to tackle this.
[01:41:14] <kwilczynski> slaughter: He also used two "z" :) He's one of us!
[01:41:43] <AsenMx> haha :D 
[01:42:49] <kwilczynski> :)
[01:43:22] <slaughter> Honestly i've only listened to the books so I was unaware of the wizard/wizzard thing and now I'm not even sure if it's real
[01:44:13] <kwilczynski> slaughter: Ricewind has it misspelled on this hat.
[01:44:36] <kwilczynski> slaughter: See if you can find BBC's mini-series they have. Quite a good an fun adaptations.
[01:44:44] <slaughter> Ah I think that's probably (probably!) the next book for me. I'm going in order written because I saw people said it would be boring and I like a challenge
[01:44:51] <slaughter> Oooh didn't know that, will do!
[01:44:58] <kwilczynski> Going Postal was superbly fun.
[01:45:17] <kwilczynski> Boring?
[01:45:18] <kwilczynski> Hmm.
[01:45:30] <kwilczynski> I personally find Terry's books fun!
[01:46:07] <kwilczynski> My God, I was laughing so much at the swamp dragons gnawing at the table legs in Guards! Guards!
[01:46:14] <slaughter> I think the idea was that most people probably just want Rincewind and if you go in order of publishing that's not what you get 
[01:46:34] <kwilczynski> Ahh, Hmm.
[01:47:30] <slaughter> But you do get Mort
[01:47:30] <kwilczynski> There are these reading maps.

[01:47:45] <kwilczynski> Mort series is great :)
[01:48:03] <slaughter> Yeah see I saw that and said screw it and went in order. So I'm on Mort right now
[01:48:10] <slaughter> I got a bit distracted with The Expanse
[01:48:17] <kwilczynski> Haha
[01:48:38] <kwilczynski> I just finished 9th book!
[01:48:41] <slaughter> And it turns out to be 109239120 hours long so it's taken a while to get back to Mort. Just 2 more books and 2 more novellas and I can listen to something other than James Fucking Holden (not that I'm complaining)
[01:48:58] <slaughter> Oh nice! I'm about halfwayish through the 7th
[01:49:11] <kwilczynski> Nice!
[01:49:22] <kwilczynski> I miss good hard science fiction.
[01:49:45] <kwilczynski> Before Expanse I got myself Seveneves.
[01:51:07] <slaughter> I was working back through Foundation (in real books!) last year, should get back to that
[01:51:20] <slaughter> Two series that are universally better than the shows they're based on
[01:59:43] <kwilczynski> :)
[01:59:51] <kwilczynski> Ah, haven't they made Foundation TV thing?
[02:01:08] <slaughter> Yeah
[02:01:36] <slaughter> It's extremely pretty with the costumes and the space and the settings and all that...but otherwise pretty bad
[02:02:21] <slaughter> As in "I'll continue to watch it but I could do it on mute and get the same effect out of it"
[02:02:35] <kwilczynski> Ahh
[02:02:37] <kwilczynski> Ouch
[02:07:43] <slaughter> It's like the old Dune movie, in that respect. Except even that pile of wtf had a little more going on story-wise
