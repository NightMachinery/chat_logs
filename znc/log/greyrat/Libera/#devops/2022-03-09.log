[04:58:18] <justsomeguy> Do engineers who do devops stuff have time to write code (really write tools from scratch using a genral purpose programming language, not only a configuration management tool)?
[04:58:46] <rawtaz> thats a very odd question
[04:58:57] <rawtaz> of course some have time to write code, and some dont
[04:59:04] <rawtaz> not sure what answer you are looking for
[04:59:18] <rawtaz> if noone had time to write code there would be way fewer devops related tools
[05:01:15] <justsomeguy> Honestly, I was just remembering my time working for the department of labor fifteen years ago, when everything was point-and-click manual windows sysadmin stuff, and mostly fire fighting. Trying to imagine a healthy percentage of my day being automation instead of firefighting is difficult. 
[05:01:34] <rawtaz> hehe
[05:01:49] * justsomeguy was sort of like an apprentice to a fiarly incompetent windows sysadmin at the time.

[12:59:40] <shad> hello world
[13:00:30] <shad> the other day I had issues with  setting up Cypress e2e tests in Gitlab CI, namely my database migrations wouldn't happen in a service because of a race condition with the postgresql service  
[13:20:24] <[twisti]> i remember you were given multiple solutions, what brings you here today ?
[13:38:30] <shad> Sorry, got side tracked
[13:38:37] <shad> Anyway, just wanted to share how that ended
[13:39:53] <shad> In the end, I got it working by building a docker image that "FROM cypress:browsers... RUN (#installing docker...)" and publishing it to my registry
[13:40:36] <shad> Keeping my API, Database as services of the CI, using that new image running Cypress+Docker as base image for the CI to run on
[13:41:20] <shad> Having that done, sharing the docker socket with a service docker-dind, making a `docker run ... my-api flask db upgrade` as the first step of my CI
[13:41:27] <[twisti]> yes, using your own image for CI is pretty common and a good idea
[13:41:46] <[twisti]> i saw a stackoverflow thing about how you can do it pretty neatly, one sec
[13:42:01] <shad> had to `--network host` the docker run step though otherwise it wouldn't route traffic to the Postgres Container
[13:42:52] <[twisti]> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59964671/gitlab-docker-runner-to-reuse-installed-software-layers accepted answer
[13:43:08] <shad> Very much convoluted, but it worked out in the end. Might need to have a cache layer somewhere to pull my cypress-dind image
[13:43:43] <[twisti]> if you have a reachable docker server for your CI script, you could also run on there via remote docker (you can configure a remote docker server to be accessed via ssh, and then you can just do `docker foo` and it will be forwarded there)
[13:43:50] <[twisti]> depending on your exact situation
[13:44:12] <shad> yes, the whole DOCKER_HOST env var
[13:44:45] <shad> but my ci runs in my managed Kubernetes gitlab runners, so there's a docker host that's spin as a service at ci time
[13:46:50] <[twisti]> might be hard to cache something that way
