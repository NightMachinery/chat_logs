[04:57:10] <Victorsueca> caveman: It actually changes a lot, miners don't get power to control the network, and they are forced to spend a majority of the bitcoin they mine in paying bills or selling them for fiat to pay the bills. Worst thing they could ever possibly do is that if someone got hold of 51% of the power in the network, they could censor transaction, but doing that would jeopardize their immediate profits abnd their ability to pay the bills due for the
[04:57:10] <Victorsueca> mining operation.
[04:58:16] <Victorsueca> In PoS one could hold onto their stake forever, a group or single person who owns enough stake could potentially get enough power to strongarm the entire system
[04:59:33] <Victorsueca> keep in mind there are probably a plethora of ways to perform this kind of strongarming without destroying the system or devaluing your stake, in some cases it might be possible to convince peple it's in their interest even when it's not
[04:59:44] <caveman> the only reason miners are not uniting in a group to form a 51% of mining power, is because sensoring transactions will cause btc's value to drop sharply, which, if happened, will be a loss to the miners; because the miners have btcs and they want them to hold their value, which is really PoS.
[05:00:54] <Victorsueca> caveman: most miners I heard about don't have stashes of bitcoin, their biggest concern is usually being able to pay the bills and salaries for the month, so there really isn't anything at stake in the long-term

[05:11:14] <Victorsueca> caveman: not exactly, rich people getting richer is an inherent property of economics, and solving it is outside the scope of Bitcoin, the problem with PoS is that while PoW limits the power of rich people by forcing them to circulate the currency (e.g. paying bills), PoS instead gives them more power than any person could reasonably ever need on that system. I guess to some people reading that on screen may sound like little difference, but in
[05:11:14] <Victorsueca> the practice it has proven to mean everything.
[05:12:18] <caveman> bitcoin is living in it.  just postponing it by needing dsha256 asics won't change the fact that money buys computational power.
[05:13:08] <caveman> PoS just simplifies it, so it's more visible what's going on.  PoW does the same as PoS, except in a more complex way, which makes people not see that it's actually fundamentally still a PoS.

[05:19:45] <caveman> true, but irrelevant.  sure, mining bitcoin doesn't have a large profit margin.  but, the fact remains: the reason the miners are not uniting to form a 51% alliance to steal btcs is simply because they will lose their stake (bitcoin's value will drop).

[05:21:43] <caveman> btc solves the double-spending problem by letting the computationally more powerful dictate its voice.  turns out money can buy most computation to dictate its voice, so why isn't it happening?  the answer is: PoS.
[05:25:55] <Victorsueca> It is relevant, PoS breaks all of the logic I just said by providing a way that in the long term will be more efficient in terms of money spent/money earned than just buying the currency, hence allowing rich investors to earn huge bucks while also opening a way for them to strongarm the system. Whereas with PoW the logic holds, hence it removes any reason to not just buy the currency in an exchange and forces the circulation of the currency,
[05:25:55] <Victorsueca> removing any power to strongarm the system.

[05:38:44] <caveman> no need.  just pay existing miners to unite to form a 51% alliance to selectively reject transactions.  why isn't this happening?
[05:40:35] <Victorsueca> miners are somewhat decentralized and spread all around the world, while there's definitely room for improvement in mining decentralization, as of right now it's good enough to put off most attempts at that
[05:42:05] <caveman> so they can't get in touch via email?
[05:43:16] <Victorsueca> also censoring a transaction would not just requiere a 51% attack, it would requiere to hold that attack for basically forever, since if the attack stops at any point the transaction would then be able to be pushed
[05:43:21] <caveman> diversity of their physical location simply makes regional alliances less likely to form.  but it is not stopping international alliances to form.  so, why do you think as such didn't form yet?
[05:44:28] <Victorsueca> because if it happened at a major scale it would be evident, reports would follow that transactions are inexplicably not confirming

[05:48:13] <Victorsueca> the miners performing those actions would be publicly roasted for doing them
[05:49:39] <caveman> why who?
[05:49:49] <caveman> by who*
[05:52:21] <Victorsueca> anyone? the real question is how the miners performing this would keep up such a 51% attack, that censoring better be goddam profitable if they want to be able to keep it up
[05:52:48] <Victorsueca> using a 51% attack to overwrite blocks is simply more expensive than just following the chain
[05:53:28] <plank> i dont really include questions of profit when considering 51% attacks
[05:54:02] <plank> the only groups resourceful enough to pull it off are states, and i would think they would be more interested in collapsing bitcoin than profiting from it
[05:57:11] *** Joins: yanmaani (~yanmaani@gateway/tor-sasl/yanmaani)
[05:58:27] <Victorsueca> plank: makes sense, so I assume if they haven't done so yet if because the costs of doing so would outweigh the benefits, would that be correct?
[05:58:36] <Victorsueca> is because*
[06:03:31] <plank> more or less how i see it
[06:03:51] <plank> the more hashpower one buys, the more expensive buying additional hashpower becomes
[06:04:12] <plank> unless you make the machines yourself
[06:04:31] <caveman> so, why aren't existing miners uniting to form a 51% alliance?  they already have the hash power.
[06:04:40] <plank> no profit in it
[06:05:13] <caveman> imagine them selectively choosing chains to undo certain transactions.  why isn't this profitable?
[06:10:26] <s1gyn> imagine there's no blockchain
[06:10:30] <caveman> it boils down to:  it will harm btc's value significantly, and bitcoiners don't want that beause they own stake in it.  so PoS is what's holding it at its root.
[06:10:31] <s1gyn> it's easy if you try

[20:44:45] <JornS> this'll sound stupid, but could bitcoind instance be online with both mainnet and testnet? ie: if I uncomment the testnet-line and enable it will that then download the testnet at the same time as mainnet?
[20:45:52] <tusko> You could run two bitcoind, one on testnet and one on mainnet. Its also possible that you could point to different data, at different times, with the same bitcoind software.
