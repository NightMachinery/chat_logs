[23:45:20] <JordiGH> If you give one raise, salaries grow without bound.
[23:45:26] <JordiGH> Therefore, no raises.
[23:45:31] <JordiGH> I swear to god this was his actual reasoning.
[23:45:39] <technomancy> it's a slippery slope! you could slip! and that would be bad.
[23:45:39] <JordiGH> That's why the FSF union was created.
[23:45:41] <imode> coming into this conversation late, JordiGH, it does matter where you live, as companies tend to adjust their salaries for cost of living.
[23:45:45] <technomancy> amazing
[23:45:58] <JordiGH> imode: I'm gonna tell them I live somewhere expensive, then.
[23:46:01] <imode> "writing software" is also dubious. what role are you filling?
[23:46:35] <imode> it's also best not to come at it particularly hostile, these are pretty standard practices, and while I agree with you, guerilla tactics probably won't win you points. :P
[23:47:08] <JordiGH> It's a war. A war with capitalism. They don't play nice, so neither should we.
[23:47:14] <manicennui> So basically RMS discovered the asshole logic that most business owners use.
[23:47:24] <imode> gotta make money to wage war on those wanting to exploit you for money, unfortunately.
[23:47:27] *** Quits: besnn (~besnn@user/besnn) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[23:47:34] <imode> no resistance made way without appropriating resources.
[23:47:46] <imode> otherwise you're chucking rocks at an attack helicopter.
[23:48:07] <JordiGH> Yeah, but I'm not gonna be thinking of the poor, abused money-holders when I ask for a salary.
[23:48:14] <manicennui> JordiGH: Just ask for what you want and be prepared to walk away.
[23:48:22] <manicennui> Don't adjust for them unless you are desperate or something.
[23:48:33] <imode> that's also a factor. :P
[23:48:37] <imode> what's the nonprofit do?
[23:48:43] <imode> what's your role?
[23:48:53] <JordiGH> manicennui: Yeah, I'm in a comfortable position where I can refuse.
[23:49:03] <JordiGH> imode: "(Sr.) software engineer"
[23:49:10] <JordiGH> I resent the "engineer" part but we'll let that slide for now.
[23:49:29] <imode> 110k for a senior position can either be a lot or a little depending where you are geographically.
[23:49:39] <JordiGH> I'm somewhere expensive.
[23:49:42] <imode> what're you currently making?
[23:49:53] <JordiGH> Not enough.
[23:49:56] <manicennui> I wouldn't accept $110k in the US.
[23:50:08] <imode> I'd accept $120k if I could move to Maine.
[23:50:11] <manicennui> Unless I was literally curing cancer, and they were giving the cure away for free.
[23:50:13] <JordiGH> I might accept it for the warm fuzzies.
[23:50:15] <imode> or somewhere similar low-cost of living.
[23:50:31] <manicennui> imode: There's just not reason to do so.
[23:50:39] <manicennui> You can move to Maine and make a high salary.
[23:50:40] <JordiGH> Okay, somewhere expensive in Canada. I can't lie about that part because they have to do Canadian tax laws when they pay me.
[23:50:56] <manicennui> Oh, well, $110k is probably a fortune to you then.
[23:51:10] <imode> but I thought you could make a high salary and live anywhere. :P
[23:51:11] <JordiGH> It would be a comfortable life in most of Canada.
[23:51:29] <imode> yeah, it really would.
[23:51:33] <JordiGH> imode: Honestly, it's total bullshit that companies think, hey, you live in a cheap place, so we'll pay you cheaply!
[23:51:39] <JordiGH> This is almost literally the reason I moved out of Mexico.
[23:51:49] <imode> JordiGH: yup, they are cost-saving entities.
[23:51:52] <JordiGH> it's so fucking insulting that I was making about a 1/3rd of my coworkers' salary when I was in Mexico.
[23:52:12] <imode> the real question is, if you're a senior software engineer at this nonprofit, are they desperate. what do they do? charitable work?
[23:52:14] *** Joins: fro (fro@humpty.dance)
[23:52:40] <JordiGH> They do something I agree with. Being vague 'cause I am somewhat cagey about where I work.
[23:52:56] <imode> understandable. I work at Amazon.
[23:52:57] <JordiGH> Also, because I don't want to compete with too many people for this job position. :P
[23:53:17] <JordiGH> Oh, I don't think I'll be competing with you. You're probably already making the big Bezos bucks.
[23:53:33] <manicennui> Nah, I didn't hold on to my AMZN.
[23:53:37] <imode> $128k base with a 40 RSU grant that's vesting this fall, next may, next fall, next may, etc.
[23:53:47] <manicennui> But I do make far more than that.
[23:53:55] <imode> syseng II, l5.
[23:54:09] <imode> I am king of my fiefdom and will move up shortly.
[23:55:17] <imode> manicennui: care to share? I need my worth validated.
[23:59:45] <pushcx> levels.fyi is solid for salary + equity (a little less so for benefits)
