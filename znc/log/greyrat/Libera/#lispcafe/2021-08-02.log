[00:52:26] <gilberth> ck_: It can't.
[00:54:07] <ck_> Yes, I remember your answer. This bug was the reason I asked the question back then
[00:54:48] <gilberth> What exactly is the bug? Asking the server about the depth?
[00:56:15] <ck_> yeah, all the time
[00:56:54] <ck_> we 'fixed' it with a memo, but from what you said earlier the real problem is that mcclim opens a new graphics context for every small tile of the pattern, for example
[00:57:24] <ck_> I wrote down the call chain here https://github.com/sharplispers/clx/pull/146#issuecomment-522339794

[01:00:08] <gilberth> I see.

[06:07:45] <sm2n> I should probably write up my hot takes some time
[06:08:14] * hayley had the pun planned for a long time to be fair.
[06:23:05] <sm2n> anyway I agree
[06:23:29] <sm2n> you can't guarantee deletion in a distributed system
[06:24:24] <sm2n> and that in a properly designed social network, federation/p2p/centralization ought to be a just a transport and persistence strategy, not a lifestyle
[06:24:58] <sm2n> the server topologies are not a valid identity
[06:25:06] <sm2n> s/the //
[06:26:29] <sm2n> what's the deal with the ios timeline thing though?
[06:27:12] <hayley> On the web Mastodon client, you get your normal timeline with people you follow, a "local" timeline with everyone on the server, and a "global" timeline with everyone the server knows about.
[06:27:53] <hayley> I never found the local timeline to be of notably better quality than the global timeline. And as we say, it makes for a lousy identity. So I don't care an awful lot that it was dropped.
[06:32:31] <hayley> (But also n.b. that a centralised system like Twitter still allows for scraping. And then you eventually get to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analog_hole if you try to avoid that.)

[06:41:33] <sm2n> right, but why are they not including it in the ios application?
[06:47:03] <hayley> I don't know.
[07:48:47] <hayley> sm2n: https://asininetech.com/2021/07/31/irreconcilable-differences/ (which is what I am arguing against) says it was so that new users wouldn't observe federation in a way.
[07:48:47] -ixelp- Irreconcilable Differences – Asinine Tech
[08:18:31] <sm2n> oh
[08:20:05] <hayley> I suppose you'd want to know something about it, but not because it apparently changes the nature of socialisation or what gets scraped.
[08:22:02] <sm2n> to be honest I don't understand why people want to tie their identity to a dns name in the first place
[08:22:17] <sm2n> local/global timelines are very poorly thought out features
[08:22:28] <sm2n> probably just implemented because it is easy
[08:22:45] <sm2n> doesn't really make sense in a federation that tries to actually promote user autonomy
[08:23:28] <sm2n> stuff like "invite-only communities" and such should be built on top of the federation, not in it, that's just stupid
[08:24:15] <hayley> In IIRC the last link of my article, the original poster decides that Secure Scuttlebutt is too inefficient because it uses proper replication, rather than only replicating to fewer servers.
[08:25:14] <hayley> There was going to be a footnote saying "If you open a dictionary, this thread comes up after 'confirmation bias, noun:'" but I didn't want to make the joke without some semblance of a critique.
[08:26:27] <sm2n> heh
[08:26:46] <sm2n> well I kind of agree with that sentiment as well
[08:27:10] <sm2n> I don't see why there needs to be a fixed replication strategy
[08:27:29] <sm2n> protocols should be adaptive imo
[08:27:48] <hayley> I always used a distributed hash table, so the workload of a node is dropped by some user-provided constant factor.
[08:28:01] <hayley> But yes, nothing really relies on the replication strategy.
[08:28:19] <sm2n> also ssb has a severe bootstrapping problem
[08:28:28] <sm2n> dhts are great
[08:28:57] <hayley> Well, I can't say much about SSB, but I believe ya.
[08:29:33] <sm2n> well the issue is you install SSB, and then you are wondering why you see nothing
[08:29:47] <sm2n> then you add one of the couple servers that relays everyone's stuff
[08:30:04] <sm2n> at which point it's questionable what value the architecture is giving you
[08:30:17] <hayley> (On "some constant factor", currently not really as to be trustless we have to verify the transitive closure of objects referenced. But hypothetically you can ditch the closure after that, or use a LRU policy.)
[08:30:20] <hayley> Hah, right.
[08:31:51] <hayley> I am not going for a "local" approach at the protocol level, so I might just give a client some bootstrap nodes.
[08:32:26] <sm2n> I think that's the right approach, though it should be configurable of course
[08:32:53] <sm2n> global DHT, local interactions

[17:01:02] <selwyn> is oxygen that plentiful in space though
[17:01:21] <selwyn> you should get it from planets e.g. earth
[17:01:25] <pjb> Reaction mass.  But yes, only dumb people would use reaction mass, when all you have to do is to invert your mass instead.
[17:01:43] <selwyn> actually, the hl2 beta did have some proposals that the earth´s air would be unbreathable iirc but they decided not to run with it
[17:02:05] <sham1> Well the Combine is not capable of local teleportation. Of course they'd be stupid enough to steal ocean water
[17:05:47] <shka> selwyn: it is very plentiful 
[17:06:40] <shka> i think that after hydrogen and helium oxygen is the third most plentiful element
[17:07:07] <shka> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abundance_of_the_chemical_elements
[17:07:08] <shka> yeah
[17:07:10] <shka> it is
[17:08:16] <hayley> They are "capable" but if you wait a whole week for the teleport.
[17:09:32] <selwyn> oh wow didn´t know that
[17:10:21] <sham1> I thought one of the plot-points was that the Combine had to use Xen for going to places
[17:10:39] <shka> eh, i don't think that this was accurate
[17:25:48] <dave0> nite all
[17:27:45] *** Quits: dave0 (~davezero@069.d.003.ncl.iprimus.net.au) (Quit: dave's not here)
[17:40:55] <selwyn> it´s implied in hl1 by the fact that xen is the ´border world´, but it may not be canon in hl2
[17:41:05] <selwyn> as the combine try to contact their homeworld directly iirc
[17:42:26] <hayley> selwyn: IIRC you use a Combine teleporter near the end of HL2.
[17:43:01] <shka> yeah, i think that "combine does not know how to teleport" was just scientist boasting
[17:43:06] <selwyn> oh right
[17:44:07] <shka> which is silly, because combine perhaps would be reluctant to deploy such technology on a wider scale in the occupied world
[17:48:31] <selwyn> cause the resistance could use it?
[17:53:24] <shka> yeah
[17:54:07] <shka> i think that combine deploys advance manufacturing techniques, but not more advance scientific principles
[17:54:17] <shka> just in case they are copied by locals
[17:55:27] <shka> i think that this is even cannon 
[17:56:54] <selwyn> i wonder if this is done irl by occupation armies, i have not heard of it
[17:56:57] <selwyn> maybe in ancient times
[17:57:30] <selwyn> i suppose you really don´t want your stealth plane to get shot down
[17:57:48] <selwyn> over enemy territory
[17:57:56] <shka> no, it was never done
[17:58:15] <shka> technical superiority is only a temporary advantage
[18:00:19] <shka> also, it is not like at one point anybody had weapon working on a unknown scientific principle 
[18:00:30] <selwyn> radar is close imo
[18:01:47] <selwyn> britain did not actually act on some advance warnings due to radar, because they did not want its existence to be deduced
[18:02:02] <selwyn> though the principle of course was known

[18:30:05] <shka> during the world war II, Americans moved back deployment of the proximity fuse on the pacific
[18:31:07] <shka> mostly because Japanese could copy that and suddenly the AA fire from ships would become significantly more efficient

[21:57:07] <lotuseater> okay
[21:58:19] <lotuseater> so there there is one guy who runs a learning institution and wants a special database for managing books
[21:58:49] <lotuseater> but I don't know too much else upto now
[22:00:24] <lotuseater> he wants to call me later for a first talk
[22:00:46] <iisi> Your contract should limit the scope as much as possible, so if they want to add anything later they have to agree to new costs.
[22:02:37] <iisi> So far it sounds like it could be met with an off-the-shelf system, since there are many book management systems. So, you'd want to probe thoroughly and compare to some existing systems.

[22:06:33] <lotuseater> yes I thought that too (the second)
[22:08:06] <lotuseater> I have no clue about payment what would be good for both sides. it's a small institution
[22:10:18] <lotuseater> it could run on 450€/month base, for as long as it needs, where nearly no taxes have to be paid. so around 40h/month
[22:25:23] <lotuseater> or when using a way more productive toolset one can achieve a payment of 225€/h for doing the same thing in 2h :D

[22:47:27] <ck_> that's completely normal
[22:48:20] <ck_> what are you doing?
[22:48:33] <shka> trying to connect to my PG database
[22:48:59] <shka> azure has this thingy where you put username@hostname as the username
[22:49:26] <shka> and hostname is stripped to redirect you to the actual database
[22:49:41] <shka> but this somehow creates problems in the cl-postgres
[22:49:54] <shka> and i know this because i am getting error
[22:50:07] <shka> and the same error if pass username@fuck!!!!
[22:50:46] <shka> Invalid connection parameters specified. Check connection parameters, and try again.
[22:50:56] <shka> and not even wrong hostname as it should be
[22:51:07] <shka> meaning that this azure thingy is not transparent 
[22:52:27] <shka> i also have other DB which somehow just wants you username as the username
[22:52:33] <shka> in azure
[22:52:41] <shka> like the god intended
[22:53:00] <shka> but this whole platform is so jank that i don't know if this is a bug or a feature
[22:53:15] <ck_> it is probably both depending on from where you look at it
[22:53:20] <ck_> like a cloud
[22:54:02] <ck_> anyway, sorry to hear about the trouble; can you put in a proxy or something?
[22:54:50] <ck_> I'm not sure I even understand completely.  You connect to 'user@host'@database-node, and the user@host isn't stripped like it should be?
[22:57:18] <shka> it is not about that
[22:57:30] <shka> cl-postgres does not parse connection strings
[22:57:48] <shka> you simply pass username password and so one as arguments to function
[22:58:17] <shka> however, whatever azure is doing later does not seem to play nice with cl-postgres
[22:59:03] <shka> and i am getting error strait from the "authenticate" function
[23:05:48] <ck_> ok
[23:09:44] <shka> ok, this seems to be feature
[23:09:55] <shka> because when i choose elastic pg instead of just pg
[23:10:02] <shka> i am getting normalass usernames
[23:10:05] <shka> to which i can connect
[23:11:24] <shka> eh, i am to tired for this shit and no solution in sight
