[02:00:46] <soulisson> I understanding that harming someone is doing something that will bad consequences on that person: physical, emotional pain, ... How can we define "harming a non-living object? for instance a device", could it be defined as putting the device in a state it shouldn't be?
[02:01:36] <MetaNova> damage
[02:04:00] <soulisson> MetaNova, ok, I read the term used even for non destructive actions. Like making a system something it wasn't supposed to do or accessing or publishing confidential data, ...
[02:04:44] <MetaNova> you can damage the file system, and you can damage reputation (confidential data being leaked)
[02:05:31] <MetaNova> just because something is damaged doesn't mean it's not repairable
[02:06:26] <soulisson> MetaNova, ok thanks. I thought at damage as destruction (complete or partial) never saw it in that light
[02:06:29] <MetaNova> think of damage as in, "integrity decline" and not, "destruction"
[02:06:48] <MetaNova> even a damaged file system is repairable, depending on how it's broken
[02:07:53] <soulisson> MetaNova, ok, but what I meant is that for instance for confidentiality, it's still considered a harming the data, even tough the data are not modified and still available to the owner.
[02:09:15] <MetaNova> if you are talking about using a device (or other piece of technology) in unintended ways/for unintended purposes, depending on circumstance, that's often called "jailbreaking"
[02:11:07] <soulisson> ok
[02:12:14] <MetaNova> soulisson: the term you're probably looking for is "misconfigure"
[02:12:57] <MetaNova> to have something suffer harm/damage in a non-destructive (because there is no physical disruption) way
[02:13:34] <MetaNova> which is the difference between emotional and physical pain, one has a physical cause, the other does not
[02:15:57] <soulisson> MetaNova, hmm, I'm not sure. I have seen it in context of computer security for malware and attacks. Usually anything that negatively impacts availability, integrity or confidentiality of a system or a data is considered as harmful to the data or the system and I guess to the stake holders as well. Anyway thanks a lot :)

[04:24:41] <rawtaz> hey peeps
[04:25:08] * rawtaz notices the topic and will try to spell properly for once
[04:26:38] <rawtaz> I'm trying to create an invoice in a very specific format that is clearly defined and structured using XML. Now, the only invoice lines in the invoice are for consultancy - i.e. work that is done per hour, for example IT consultancy or some other consultancy. A consultant hired per hour, plain and simple.
[04:27:57] <rawtaz> The list of possible unit codes for invoice lines is at https://docs.peppol.eu/poacc/billing/3.0/codelist/UNECERec20/ and the only ones I've been able to identify being applicable or seemingly appropriate for this type of unit are the "HUR" (Hour) one and the "LH" (Labour hour) one.
[04:29:11] <rawtaz> I *guess* that the HUR one would work for this use case, but I would like to better understand what "Labour hour" means in this context, because there's a reason someone created a code for it instead of just referring to usage of the "Hour" one.
[04:30:33] <rawtaz> Unfortunately my Duck-foo and even Google-foo isnt very successful, so I'm asking you people in here what you think "Labour hour" means in this context. Is there any reason to think that it would be more suitable for specifying the unit type of some consultancy work in an invoice?
[04:31:35] <rawtaz> for further reference, there's also OT for "Overtime hour".
[04:31:41] <rawtaz> s/f/F/

[05:08:26] <rucker> Hi! Not sure if this is off-topic, but could you guys help me complete a rhyme?
[05:11:50] <tinwhiskers> never know ya luck
[05:12:08] <rucker> Hehe
[05:12:44] <tinwhiskers> ...but it's fine to ask
[05:13:09] <rucker> tinwhiskers: If you don't mind me asking though, have you written any rhymes before, if so could you share?
[05:14:03] <tinwhiskers> if you'd like to actually ask your question *someone* in the channel may be able to help.
[05:14:17] <tinwhiskers> i.e. don't ask to ask
[05:16:24] <rucker> Ok
[05:16:31] <rawtaz> yeah just get to the point :-)
[05:16:56] <rucker> "Chick with a bitch-shield, I eat her up like a Happy Meal"
[05:17:12] <rucker> After that I'm blank :-(
[05:17:53] <rucker> Those bitch-shields are hard to disarm, especially if she's a perfect 10.
[05:18:30] <rawtaz> hhe thats on a level im not even going to occupy one brain cell with :P
[05:18:58] <tinwhiskers> yeah. I don't believe this is very genuine either, so I'm out.
[05:19:08] <rucker> rawtaz: It's rhythmically correct, and it means something.
[05:19:47] <MetaNova> nursery rhymes flow better
[05:19:57] <rucker> Especially if you've met a perfect 10 with a rude mouth. Yet managed to man-handle her using only your verbal skills.
[05:20:03] <rawtaz> rucker: uh yeah but it's text about bitches and eating them? like wtf.
[05:20:23] <rawtaz> i think there might be a cultural difference between us :)
[05:20:30] <rawtaz> (not judging, just guessing)
[05:20:53] <rucker> Hehe, true
[05:23:25] <rucker> Ok another one:
[05:23:35] <rucker> Where I'm equally blank:
[05:24:16] <rucker> Okidokez. Eating artichokes with Marty's folks. Kicking Bacardi-jokes, until she takes off her clothes.
[05:25:30] <rucker> Rapping about male-female relations is also about enlarging ones country's population.
[05:27:18] <tinwhiskers> if it's like the last one, lets not.
[05:27:20] <rucker> And falling in love.
[05:32:22] <rucker> MetaNova: Mind sharing some of your flows?
[05:32:24] <rucker> Aka. poems

[05:49:52] <rucker> Hehe, me too.
[05:50:50] <rawtaz> i find the context intersting, what makes me and perhaps others in here less interested in your particulars is that theyre about women and i dunno what to say but conquering them or similar. its just untasteful to many who probably arent from the same culture

[05:51:35] <rawtaz> does that make any sense to you or is it completely foreign the other way around (in your eyes, i mean)?
[05:51:54] <rucker> I totally get that.
[05:52:04] <tinwhiskers> I don't believe that for a minute given your other comments. My feeling is that you're being deliberately provocative to amuse yourself. 
[05:52:09] <tinwhiskers> i.e. trolling
[05:52:38] <rawtaz> tinwhiskers: while its possible, its also equally or reasonably more possible that it's not trolling. these types of texts are quite common in a lot of rap
[05:53:10] <tinwhiskers> So as far as I'm concerned you will not be dragging the channel down into your mindset to contribute to that here
[05:53:10] <rawtaz> (i dont make any but ive heard a fair bit of it :)
[05:54:04] <tinwhiskers> in any case, write your own damn rhymes otherwise you're utterly failing in what you are setting out to do. Have someone read it after you've achieved something.
[05:54:12] <rucker> rawtaz: Also, at least in the West, women find this stuff funny.
[05:54:23] <tinwhiskers> two lines of trash. nuh uh.
[05:54:23] <rucker> And if you can deliver these rhymes successfully, they will fall at your feet.

[08:16:13] <pussipupu> Yeah it's a term best avoided
[08:17:19] <pussipupu> Interestingly “spastic”, the word it stems from was IIRC specifically coined not to be offensive to those it labels, turns out that didn't last...
[08:18:39] <pussipupu> I think it still has its technical medical usages as an adjective, but I don't hang out with Anglophone doctors so I'unno

[08:39:38] <twb> pussipupu: "spastic", like "retard" and "idiot" were originally terms of art in education
[08:39:45] <toretto> Is it legal in English to use `'ve` with any words that'll be followed by a `have` or `had` or `will`? Like, with `also` as `also've` (eg: I also've attached two videos)
[08:39:48] <toretto> ?
[08:40:00] <pussipupu> I'm aware, though “idiot” is older than that by far at root
[08:40:29] <toretto> (`'ll` or `'d` also I mean)
[08:40:45] <toretto> (for will and had/would correspondingly)
[08:40:52] <pussipupu> And “spastic” isn't/wasn't about educational needs
