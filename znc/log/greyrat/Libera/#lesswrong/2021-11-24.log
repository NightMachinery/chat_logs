[02:38:05] <two2thehead> "Co-speech hand gestures are a ubiquitous form of nonverbal communication, which can express additional information that is not present in speech. Hand gestures may become more relevant when speech production is impaired as in patients with post-stroke aphasia. In fact, patients with aphasia produce more gestures than control speakers. Further, their gestures seem to be more relevant for the understanding of their communication."

[02:42:04] <two2thehead> "Our results show that hand gestures produced by speakers with aphasia are on average longer attended than gestures produced by control speakers. This effect is significant even when we control for the longer duration of the gestural movements in speakers with aphasia. Further, the amount of information in speech was correlated with gesture attention: gestures produced by speakers with less informative speech were attended more frequently. In 
[02:42:04] <two2thehead> conclusion, our results highlight two main points. First, overt attention for co-speech hand gesture increases with their communicative relevance. Second, these findings have clinical implications because they show that the extra effort that speakers with aphasia put into gesture is worthwhile, as interlocutors seem to notice their gestures."

[03:26:14] <Robomot> Culture War Roundup for the week of November 22, 2021 : TheMotte (32 votes, 786 comments. This weekly roundup thread is intended for all culture war posts. is vaguely defined, but it basically means controversial …)

[03:26:30] <Obormot\Arcturus> From the late 1940's to 1997, the upscale toaster market was dominated by this classic from Sunbeam. Its sophisticated lines, art deco styling, and consistent toasting quality made it a pleasure both to the eyes and the palate.
[03:27:34] * gwern continues to be amused that 'upscale toaster market' is totally a thing and there are japanese manufacturers dabbling in smartphones to advertise their toasters
[03:28:40] <gwern> hm, is that the 'flying toaster' screensaver one?
[03:29:04] <Obormot\Arcturus> That description (and the toaster itself!) reminds me of that scene in DS9's "Trials and Tribble-ations" where, having gone back in time to the TOS era, Dax is like "oh man, the old tricorders, I loved these"
[03:29:09] <two2thehead> "Lichtenberger and Kaufman (2009, p. 167) defined unitary ability as “an ability […] that is represented by a cohesive set of scaled scores, each reflecting slightly different or unique aspects of the ability.” Flanagan and Kaufman (2009) and Lichtenberger and Kaufman (2012), to define unitarity of IQ, use a difference of 23 IQ points between the highest score (Max) and the lowest score (Min) obtained by a subject in the four Index
[03:29:10] <two2thehead> es of WAIS-IV. A similar method has been used to assess the unitary ability for the four Indexes, with the threshold of 5. Such difference score (of 23 for IQ and 5 for Indexes) are considered high and infrequent and, the authors therefore conclude that the corresponding Full-Scale IQ score or Index score is uninterpretable. In this paper we argue that these thresholds are inappropriate because they are based on the wrong standard deviation. The 
[03:29:10] <two2thehead> main aim of this study was to establish variability thresholds for IQ and the WAIS-IV Indexes for the American standardization sample and to compare these thresholds with those for the Italian standardization sample. We also consider an alternative approach to determining whether an IQ score represents a unitary ability based on the maximum difference score for the 10 core subtests that contribute to Full-Scale IQ."
[03:29:16] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Chrome finish, black highlights...)
[03:30:19] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: No, the flying toasters had the lever in line with the slots; this one has the lever normal to the slots
[03:30:55] <gwern> I'm not sure that really proves that wasn't the inspiration
[03:30:58] <Obormot\Arcturus> ... wait, that's not even a lever? Hm
[03:31:10] <Obormot\Arcturus> "The Sunbeam Radiant Control toaster is a classic for several reasons. It's beauty is apparent. But its real appeal is in its performance. Sunbeam called it _Automatic Beyond Belief_. There are no levers to press down. Just put the bread in the slot. The weight of the bread activates the heating elements, causing the center wire to lengthen microscopically and the bread to be carried into the toaster under its own weight. "
[03:32:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Once a person has experienced a Radiant Control toaster, the common response is, "This is how all toasters should work." One couldn't express the understated elegance of this toaster more succinctly." ... wow, I agree, why the heck don't all toasters work like this??
[03:35:16] <gwern> hm. how does it pop up if it is purely gravity-powered?
[03:35:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> Read the page, it explains
[03:35:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Sunbeam Radiant Control toasters were made to last a lifetime. It's not unusual at all to find one that has been in daily service for 50 years and is still going strong. Try that with one of those plastic WalMart toasters!" ... another example of decline in quality
[03:36:18] <gwern> 'When the thermostat opens, the elements cool, and the center element wire contracts. This movement is very small — on the order of thousandths of an inch — but a mechanical linkage multiplies this movement approximately 175 times. This is sufficient to operate the carriage and raise the toasted bread from the toaster.' <-- hm. so it's bleeding off energy from the heated coil?
[03:36:56] <gwern> I'm impressed if this works without a glitch for 50 years. it sounds rather finicky and liable to become miscalibrated at any time, but apparently not
[03:38:12] <gwern> (the 175x I assume means that the contraction is extremely high torque, and so can be amplified through gears or something into a much 'lengthier' low-tortque movement. usually, you go the other way, gearing down a fast movement into a slow but high torque movement)
[03:40:38] <shawwwn> fuck life
[03:42:43] * gwern rolls his eyes at his 404s. '/docshnvonneumanadocumentary.mkv'? are you even trying? how on earth do you go from '/docs/science/1966-mathematicalassociationofamerica-documentary-maavideoclassics2-johnvonneumanadocumentary.mkv' to... that?
[03:45:23] <gwern> (I mean, someone had to have typed that in. that's not a software mangling or bot. but what thought process would lead you to type that in, I can't begin to imagine. why 'hn'? why drop the slashes?)
[03:47:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: "hn" because it's at the end of "john"
[03:48:10] <gwern> ah
[03:48:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: That's the first five characters of the path, plus the last ... however many
[03:48:19] <gwern> I kept thinking 'hacker news'
[03:48:49] <gwern> 'ok so you found the link on hn, but then wouldn't be more logical, anon, for it to be at the end? or separated somehow?'
[03:49:15] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: As for how it happened, it could be: start typing, computer lags / freezes after "/docs", then unfreezes just in time for "hnvonneuman" ... etc.
[03:49:50] <gwern> yeah, I can see that now once you know 'hn' indicates it's at least partially cutoff from a possible genuine correct path 'docs..hnvonneumann.mkv'

[04:05:44] <catern> >One of the purposes of these bondage depictions was to induce eroticism in readers as a part of what he called "sex love training." Through his Wonder Woman comics, he aimed to condition readers to becoming more readily accepting of loving submission to loving authorities rather than being so assertive with their own destructive egos. About male readers, he later wrote: "Give them an alluring woman stronger than themselves to submit
[04:05:44] <catern>  to, and they'll be proud to become her willing slaves!"
[04:05:48] <catern> what the fuck

[06:29:36] <kuudes> gwern, re finnish railroad gauge; there is about 6000 km of rails in finland https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/field/railways/country-comparison/
[06:29:36] <Robomot> Railways - The World Factbook
[06:30:37] <gwern> kuudes: sure, but you guys spend a crazy amount of money on all sorts of anti-russian things (such as exploding railroad infrastructure...?) which would probably impede them less than rendering 6000km of rail completely useless to them because they lack the right gauge trains
[06:30:53] <gwern> kuudes: and you'd gain greater interop compatibility with the rest of europe
[06:31:35] <gwern> countries have changed over which side of the road they drive on, their measurement system, or gauges before. I don't see why finland couldn't either
[06:32:34] <Bakunin> Megan McArdle is a real weirdo
[06:32:55] <gwern> are you denying her lived experience and friends?
[06:33:12] <Bakunin> she thinks weight loss is correlated more to diet than exercise and metabolic rate
[06:33:40] <Bakunin> but im sure being a news pol auto-confers Nutritionist knowledge
[06:33:59] <Bakunin> lazy writer is lazy
[06:35:28] <kuudes> gwern, sure. though already just the new rails between helsinki and tampere (some 200 km) will cost about 0.5% of gdp
[06:35:33] <gwern> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_gauge_conversions hm. unfortunate that this doesn't list the size of the conversion in terms of kilometers
[06:35:34] <Robomot> List of gauge conversions - Wikipedia (.mw-parser-output .frac{white-space:nowrap}.mw-parser-output .frac .num,.mw-parser-output .frac .den{font-size:80%;line-height:0;vertical-align:super}.mw-parser-output .frac .den{vertical-align:sub}.mw-parser-output .sr-only{border:0;clip:rect(0,0,0,0);height:1px;margin:-1px;overflow:hidden;padding:0;position:absolute;width:1px})
[06:35:45] <kuudes> but yeah, I could see worse ways to burn moneys
[06:36:02] <Bakunin> Narrow gauge was a mistake
[06:36:31] <gwern> kuudes: how much does a russian invasion cost as % of gdp... also, building a new railway ought to cost way more than a gauge conversion. after all, you're blasting tunnels through mountains and building new stations and whatnot. you're not moving rails literally an inch or two to the side and then bolting them back down
[06:38:38] <kuudes> we don't have mountains here but I guess they might have to buy some land
[06:38:52] <kuudes> there will be less stations as the point is to speed intercity travel
[06:39:20] <kuudes> but yeah, maybe indeed
[06:40:09] <kuudes> china has started a weekly freight rail connection to east finland over russia recently
[06:40:56] <gwern> 'weekly' doesn't sound like that much
[06:41:15] <kuudes> well it is mostly empty 60 cars or something
[06:41:39] <kuudes> belt and road pays for it I think
[06:42:21] <kuudes> finland still upkept the invasion rail line near kuusamo in... early 10s?
[06:42:42] <kuudes> before an entrepreneuer faked on having a contract to dismantle it and dismantled it and sold to scrap
[06:43:31] <kuudes> though I wonder if it was mined. presumably not given there was no loss of life when dismantling it
[06:44:50] <Bakunin> China will dominate the future, it's pretty obvious

[06:48:32] <kuudes> not yet. but it is possible I will be
[06:48:45] <Bakunin> who are you striking
[06:49:13] <kuudes> the computing service industry general contract will end at the end of this month
[06:49:33] <Bakunin> this channel has diversity
[06:49:48] <kuudes> and it seems possible the next general contract would have less than 50% of employees
[06:49:58] <kuudes> so it would not be immediately generally binding
[06:50:25] <kuudes> which seems to open up the situation that there would be some sort of labor action against the noncontracting companies or something in the winter
[06:50:52] <Bakunin> Im starting to think the management exploitation dance involves at least one step of "how bad do you want it" solidarity check

[06:53:19] <gwern> kuudes: so I keep reading. I'm not sure how seriously to take it all. tensions ramp up on a fairly regular basis. how many years are there where russia isn't probing?

[06:55:26] <Bakunin> kuudes the tension in Ukraine will be studied for a long time afterwards.  If Putin were to suddenly die, so many of these globally-operating hostile enterprises would vanish.

[10:12:19] <phill> This is so odd

[10:12:22] <Robomot> Avoidant personality disorder - Maruta - 2012 - Personality and Mental Health - Wiley Online Library (In this paper, we discuss avoidant personality disorder and its complexities by presenting a case in which the differential diagnosis was extremely difficult. The presented case concerns a patient, w...)
[10:12:31] <phill> (Behind paywall)
[10:12:59] <phill> When he was a 14-year-old junior high school student, he felt that other students were annoyed by the smell of his genitourinary organs including sperm and urine. In particular, he felt those smells became stronger when he was nervous in front of other people. Consequently, he tried to avoid coming physically close to others and felt ashamed of his perceived smells"
[10:14:49] <adiabatic> one way to appreciate the complexity of anything is to see how many ways it can fuck up
[10:15:06] <adiabatic> the brain's many failure modes are a sight to behold

[10:18:55] <adiabatic> weird target to shoot for
[10:19:05] <feep> well, like a refactoring step, right?
[10:19:21] <feep> since we know -- oh hey, landing camera shot, only 20 minutes late lol
[10:19:31] <adiabatic> well, it's not obviously easier than aiming for a full-blown adult
[10:19:36] <feep> mh
[10:19:48] <feep> my argument would be, we know aiming for a full-blown adult is obviously hard
[10:19:55] <Khoth> "1972 - Alain Colmerauer designs the logic language Prolog. His goal is to create a language with the intelligence of a two year old. He proves he has reached his goal by showing a Prolog session that says "No." to every query."
[10:19:57] <feep> and aiming for a baby is imo less obviously hard

[10:27:08] <adiabatic> Obormot\Arcturus: this sounds cool but I'm not sure what it is. A way to say you want an SAMutableGrabBag of only one type of thing?
[10:27:52] <adiabatic> also I wrote my first thing ever in Swift a couple days ago and wonder if you have any opinions about it at all
[10:32:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> adiabatic: I mean that I went from this:
[10:32:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> @interface NSArray (SA_NSArrayExtensions)
[10:32:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> -(id) find:(BOOL (^)(id obj))test;
[10:32:48] <Obormot\Arcturus> To this:
[10:32:53] <Obormot\Arcturus> @interface NSArray <__covariant ObjectType> (SA_NSArrayExtensions)
[10:32:53] <Obormot\Arcturus> -(ObjectType) find:(BOOL (^)(ObjectType obj))test;
[10:33:13] <adiabatic> that sounds like exactly what I was thinking of
[10:33:15] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Similarly map, forEach, etc.)
[10:33:20] * adiabatic pats himself on the back
[10:33:48] <Obormot\Arcturus> And suddenly the compiler is like HEY wtf do you think you're enumerating an array of, you idiot
[10:34:23] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Oh uh I guess this thing" "THEN IT MAKES NO SENSE TO RETURN IT FROM THIS METHOD, DOES IT" "... oh"
[10:34:39] <adiabatic> Does Objective-C have a way to specify "this is an NSArray<NSString*>" now?
[10:34:48] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yes
[10:34:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> That was is literally the thing you just typed :p
[10:34:57] <Obormot\Arcturus> *way
[10:35:52] <Obormot\Arcturus> e.g `NSDictionary <NSString *, NSString *> *_hostPatternUserAgentMapping;`
[10:36:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> As for Swift, my opinion is that it's cool but on the whole I still prefer ObjC
[10:36:56] <Obormot\Arcturus> I am a big fan of pattern matching syntax though
[10:40:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> Now I think I need to write a reduce for NSArray ...
[10:41:41] <adiabatic> for completness, because you want to add up an NSArray<NSNumber*>, or, because you have grander plans?
[10:42:49] <Obormot\Arcturus> Grander
[10:43:03] <adiabatic> implementing Redux in Objective-C?
[10:43:10] <Obormot\Arcturus> Not that grand :p
[10:44:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> Just writing a comprehensive, unified solution to compressing summary strings
[10:44:36] <Obormot\Arcturus> (By which I do not mean like "byte size compression" but "length compression")

[10:45:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> I've finally reached the "no more bricolage!" stage of dealing with "how to make sure Robomot's output fits into a single IRC message"
[10:45:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> All hacks will be rectified. It will do the Right Thing, for all time
[10:46:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> And that requires a reduce (or, at any rate, is made vastly easier thereby)

[10:50:52] <Obormot\Arcturus> (In fact I see he hasn't written anything for NSHipster since. Is he ok??)
[10:51:06] <adiabatic> maybe he moved away from brooklyn

[10:52:50] <PapuaHardyNet> hey obormot, how does robomot deal with recursively posted links
[10:53:00] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Take a moment, standing in front of this painting, to reflect on the enigmatic nature of time. Think now about how our limited understanding of time is reflected in — or perhaps exacerbated by — the naming of the Foundation date and time APIs."
[10:53:04] <PapuaHardyNet> say, you post a link. The link's description contains the same link.
[10:53:36] <Obormot\Arcturus> PapuaHardyNet: This scenario is made wholly irrelevant by how IRC works
[10:53:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> You don't get your own messages sent to you
[10:54:17] <PapuaHardyNet> really? I had no idea
[10:54:41] <PapuaHardyNet> oh wait, you are right. I recall reading ii's server logs and what you say makes sense
[10:55:38] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yes... this is why two different IRC clients can show you messages in different order (well, it's not the only reason, but it's a common one)
[10:56:19] <Obormot\Arcturus> The message stream in your chat window is an indiscriminate mix of messages received from the server and messages inserted via your text entry field
[10:57:29] <Obormot\Arcturus> In fact when the client prints your own chat message in the chat window, that's really no guarantee that it was actually sent to the server, actually received by the server, etc.
[10:59:16] <Obormot\Arcturus> PapuaHardyNet: Anyway, even if that weren't true, it would be trivial for Robomot to filter messages by origin... for example, LinkBot (the module that parses messages for links, and prints summaries based on retrieved documents) filters based on IRC message type
[11:00:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> Anything but PRIVMSG is ignored
[11:01:57] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Well, technically it ignores any but a set of four more specific message categories, but those happen to map exactly back to the PRIVMSG type)

[13:35:34] <shawwwn> I'm chatting with Generally Intelligent on Monday. They seem to be serious about AGI, which piqued my interest.
[13:37:30] <shawwwn> The CEO was extremely open about their approach, which is was refreshing. (I don't think it's any kind of competitive advantage to keep it secret, since nobody knows what the real path is to AGI.)
[13:38:23] <shawwwn> I guess I should back up and explain. I kept seeing Generally Intelligent ads on HN, so I looked them up on Twitter and DM'ed the CEO asking whether they were serious about AGI and why
[13:38:43] <shawwwn> citing some of my prior convos with Gurkenglas (https://twitter.com/theshawwn/status/1446076902607888385)
[13:39:26] <Gurkenglas> if they happen to be betting on the right horse, they might expect this to become clear at some point, so they're preparing correctly for the world where they have the potential to win by keeping their approach secret
[13:39:52] <Gurkenglas> note also that in that case it's a serious safety advantage due to less racing
[13:40:02] <shawwwn> yes, that's pretty much everyone's view. Which is why it was very refreshing that she didn't try to conceal their approach
[13:40:18] <Gurkenglas> what is good about it?
[13:40:35] <Gurkenglas> just, good for your soul, like not lying?
[13:40:37] <shawwwn> she pretty much told me the details right away, and suggested we discuss further on a Zoom call. (It was supposed to be today, but I was sick, so it's MOnday)
[13:41:04] <shawwwn> well, my view is that keeping an approach secret is almost never a competitive advantage.
[13:41:38] <shawwwn> The scientific establishment sort of proves this conclusively, as the whole point of research is to publish results openly.
[13:41:54] <Gurkenglas> because the harm from others overtaking you is less than the good from others improving on your approach?
[13:42:24] <shawwwn> nah, I think that there's legitimately no chance that someone else will overtake you based on your own plans
[13:42:49] <shawwwn> companies have their own stakeholders with their own ideas. It pretty much never happens that someone looks at an existing company, copies their approach, and does it better than you.

[13:44:02] <nshepperd2> sus
[13:44:10] <nshepperd2> nothing google makes is ever surprisingly easy
[13:44:22] <Gurkenglas> or is that because the idea was not necessarily already being followed by an existing company?
[13:44:42] <shawwwn> nshepperd2: I was as surprised as anyone
[13:45:55] <shawwwn> like usual, there's a silly trick to it that's hard to find.
[13:46:27] <shawwwn> but *basically* it boils down to, clone jax, cd into ./build, then run python3 build.py --enable_tpu
[13:46:57] <shawwwn> now, there's two reasons why that's not directly useful, which is probably why nobody noticed
[13:47:17] <shawwwn> reason number one is that most of the interesting parts of jax actually live in the tensorflow codebase
[13:47:28] <shawwwn> the build script clones its own tensorflow via bazel, and builds from that
[13:47:37] <shawwwn> which means you can't even make any changes
[13:48:02] <shawwwn> the antidote to that is also simple. open up WORKSPACE (it's at the toplevel) and uncomment the block about local tensorflow
[13:48:25] <shawwwn> it's a short file. you comment the top part (which downloads tensorflow) and uncomment the middle part (which mentions local tensorflow)
[13:48:25] <Gurkenglas> shawwwn, https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/5-companies-that-stole-ideas-and-became-successful-710685799ce9 these seem applicable
[13:48:27] <Robomot> 5 Companies That Stole Ideas and Became Successful | by Ash Jurberg | Entrepreneur's Handbook (When I was studying business at college, I was constantly told that you had to be first in the market to be successful in business. So we studied first movers' advantage, the benefits of gaining a…)
[13:48:41] <shawwwn> then you clone tensorflow one level up, and symlink it to ./tensorflow inside jax
[13:48:59] <shawwwn> so I have mine at ~/ml/tensorflow-tpu, and I do ln -s $HOME/ml/tensorflow-tpu ~/ml/jax/tensorflow
[13:49:44] <shawwwn> at that point, the build script will build that local tensorflow, which means you can make changes and actually see them. i.e. you can do useful things.
[13:49:50] <shawwwn> so that was reason number one.
[13:50:12] <shawwwn> reason number two, is that by default, bazel has *no caching*. Meaning it takes 20 minutes every time it builds, which is incomprehensible  as a default
[13:50:33] <shawwwn> to enable that:

[13:52:03] <nshepperd2> gosh
[13:52:14] <shawwwn> at *that* point, it's now finally building your local tensorflow, *and* it only takes a few seconds whenever you make a code change
[13:52:35] <nshepperd2> just 15 simple steps
[13:52:42] <nshepperd2> hehehe
[13:52:45] <shawwwn> :)
[13:53:02] <shawwwn> it's pretty darn simple for 20 person-years of complexity
[13:53:06] <shawwwn> I was impressed
[13:53:51] <shawwwn> the last thing you'll need is some kind of development environment to poke around tensorflow. And I've got you covered for that: https://gist.github.com/shawwn/0e524d4a7a5d8fb152a86616559cc02a mentions cmake-gen-globs

[13:54:15] <shawwwn> this https://github.com/shawwn/tensorflow/tree/cmake
[13:54:22] <shawwwn> just clone this somewhere, and `brew install clion`
[13:54:27] <feepbot> GitHub - shawwn/tensorflow at cmake (An Open Source Machine Learning Framework for Everyone - GitHub - shawwn/tensorflow at cmake)
[13:54:40] <shawwwn> then literally just open clion to that clone, and almost everything will work
[13:55:14] <shawwwn> if you actually do this, though, make sure to run these clones https://github.com/shawwn/tensorflow/blob/cmake/CMakeLists.txt#L20-L27
[13:55:27] <feepbot> tensorflow/CMakeLists.txt at cmake · shawwn/tensorflow · GitHub (An Open Source Machine Learning Framework for Everyone - tensorflow/CMakeLists.txt at cmake · shawwn/tensorflow)
[13:55:34] <Gurkenglas> shawwwn, do you find the entire concept of trade secret nonsensical?
[13:55:47] <shawwwn> because without those, clion can't really make sense of e.g. the pybind calls, or the google test macros
[13:55:54] <shawwwn> so code analysis will fail
[13:56:10] <shawwwn> but once you have it open in clion, it's pretty sweet. you can command-B to go to definition
[13:56:27] <shawwwn> and press shift twice and then start typing any symbol you're curious about, like PjRtClient or whatever
[13:56:41] <shawwwn> so that's how I build my own jax.
[13:57:05] <shawwwn> Gurkenglas: I admit that my feelings on the matter are pretty fringe.
[13:57:15] <Gurkenglas> shawwwn, Macintosh was a copy of what Xerox was doing (ba dum ts)
[13:57:31] <shawwwn> I was briefly worried before you said the ba dum ts :D

[13:58:10] <shawwwn> (I can't tell if you're joking, but yes of course, the alto is famous)
[13:58:40] <nshepperd2> Gurkenglas: afaict shawwwn doesn't think ufai destroyed the world is an actual threat
[13:59:05] <shawwwn> what you know is wrong, because you rarely ask questions about my perspective
[13:59:15] <shawwwn> my perspective is that there's no chance of AGI being invented, so therefore it's not a threat
[13:59:17] <kuudes> http://euromaidanpress.com/2021/11/23/russias-sberbank-operates-in-russian-occupied-crimea-covertly-to-avoid-further-sanctions-report/
[13:59:20] <Robomot> Russia's largest bank Sberbank operates in occupied Crimea covertly to avoid further sanctions -- reportEuromaidan Press | News and views from Ukraine (Read also: Sanctions on Russia are working, but they're not enough The report reveals that the first mortgage agreements on the Crimean real estate to involve Sberbank were recorded in 2019, but now this type of activity has become widespread.  …)
[13:59:24] <shawwwn> that's distinctly different than ufai not being a threat.
[13:59:25] <nshepperd2> yes thats what i thought
[13:59:34] <kuudes> rudalle owners operate in sanctions-bordering stuff
[13:59:41] <Gurkenglas> for the sake of this argument i was taking shawwwn's perspective on ufai to see if i can convince him that trade secrets are good for selfish reasons anyway.
[14:00:25] <shawwwn> I'm so confused. where did the convo start talking about ufai?
[14:00:38] <shawwwn> I'd like to think I'm smart, but it went totally over my head.
[14:00:54] <nshepperd2> when Gurkenglas mentioned that keeping AGI secret is a safety advantage
[14:00:59] <nshepperd2> AGI technology
[14:01:23] <shawwwn> but it's impossible to make AGI safe
[14:01:32] <shawwwn> so it's not a safety advantage
[14:01:52] <shawwwn> (I don't see where Gurkenglas mentioned that, fwiw, but I guess it's inferred from context.)
[14:01:54] <Gurkenglas> It's certainly hard, but why do you believe it's impossible?
[14:02:08] <nshepperd2> its an advantage because if you invent AGI and don't keep it secret some kid is 100% certain to run it and destroy the world
[14:02:23] <Gurkenglas> 11:09:52: <Gurkenglas> note also that in that case it's a serious safety advantage due to less racing
[14:02:29] <nshepperd2> if you do keep it secret, maybe you can have enough self control to not run it yourself
[14:02:34] * shawwwn wonders how he missed that. thanks
[14:02:54] <shawwwn> the idea that AGI is "run" seems incorrect
[14:03:04] <shawwwn> you're not being "run" right now. you just exist in a world.
[14:03:14] <nshepperd2> i run ML models all the time
[14:03:38] <shawwwn> yes. and ML models aren't AGI. ML models aren't even proximate to whatever AGI might turn out to be
[14:03:39] <Gurkenglas> If I were an upload, I would be run. I could be copied, edited, rewound. The same is true for an AGI
[14:03:53] <shawwwn> AGI has a hundred thousand years to execute human civilization
[14:04:04] <shawwwn> it will outlast us almost by definition
[14:04:04] <nshepperd2> ok whatever
[14:04:21] <shawwwn> name one technology where humans invented it and then were like "nah, let's not use this"
[14:04:34] <Gurkenglas> nukes
[14:04:35] <shawwwn> nukes are being used, even if they're not being exploded
[14:04:39] * shawwwn predicted that
[14:04:48] <Gurkenglas> we might use agi without exploding it
[14:04:54] <shawwwn> uh huh. sure.
[14:05:09] <shawwwn> "just outsmart the AGI 4Head"
[14:05:22] <shawwwn> who would you bet on?
[14:05:34] <nshepperd2> this is just base sophistry
[14:05:44] <shawwwn> you know what nshepperd2 
[14:05:58] <nshepperd2> companies intending to develop agi are trying to write a program they can run
[14:06:01] <Gurkenglas> not necessarily outsmart - maybe we can have it want to help us. but not necessarily impossible to outsmart, since you can in fact copy, edit and rewind.
[14:06:50] <Gurkenglas> if you have all the time you need, you can run it very slowly in order to interpret its thoughts as they form.
[14:07:14] <shawwwn> Gurkenglas: I enjoyed our conversation, but I think I have to excuse myself now. I don't feel comfortable chatting about this around nshepperd2. Feel free to continue in DMs if you'd like
[14:07:44] <shawwwn> I respect your feelings on the matter, but I have my own as well.

[14:51:52] <kuudes> Gurkenglas, you seem to me to be about trying to convince people of beliefs that are noncentral and which you have not thought out for long, but also be good at drilling down to specific things. you asked previously why this seems violent: I do not wish to be convinced of random stuff just because I have faced a confidence-bot. it would be better if you would broadcast your mental model without explicit persuasion tricks, so that the other party can read 
[14:51:52] <kuudes> your whole opinion on the matter and then judge if they need to update to where
[14:52:31] <kuudes> re "for the sake of this argument i was taking shawwwn's perspective on ufai to see if i can convince him that trade secrets are good for selfish reasons anyway"
[14:52:58] <kuudes> ie don't convince people for random opinions. only for opinions you have judged true and useful
[14:53:28] <shawwwn> hmm? I like Gurkenglas' question stream
[14:53:38] <kuudes> yes, but you are you
[14:53:47] <shawwwn> yes, I am me
[14:54:00] <shawwwn> why do you get to come in and have a problem with it?
[14:54:22] <kuudes> because Gurkenglas asked previously this question from me and I now answered to his question
[14:54:29] <shawwwn> ah
[14:54:53] <shawwwn> my apologies. I didn't realize he explicitly asked you by name whether his questions were problematic.
[14:55:03] <kuudes> yes
[14:55:08] <kuudes> no worries
[14:56:01] <shawwwn> I guess I was being defensive of him because he's one of the few people here who seem genuinely interested in other people's perspectives.
[14:56:26] <shawwwn> but it's not my place, so I'll bow out.
[15:17:40] <Gurkenglas> kuudes, reasoning people into whichever opinions they *can* be reasoned into is a force for truth! it's basically our only force for truth!
[15:18:12] <Gurkenglas> (well, that and experiments)
[15:18:14] <feep[work]> Gurkenglas: is that, like ... black arts accelerationism?
[15:18:19] <feep[work]> dark arts*
[15:19:33] <Gurkenglas> no, dark arts is the name for the parts that work away from truth as well
[15:20:02] <feep[work]> ohey I didn't know this - the black arts is a historic term for book printers
[15:20:12] <feep[work]> analogously, the white arts are papermaking XD

[15:20:56] <feep[work]> Gurkenglas: right but the way you said it was, convincing anyone of anything they *can* be convinced of is truthtracking
[15:21:05] <feep[work]> which, um. I think that needs more work to support?
[15:21:34] <feep[work]> like, by that metric convincing someone of something untrue but persuasive would be truth-furthering
[15:21:39] <feep[work]> hence, dark arts accelerationism
[15:22:07] <feep[work]> it's like "that which can be destroyed, should be"
[15:22:23] <Gurkenglas> persuasive correlates with true
[15:22:44] <feep[work]> goodhart perks up
[15:23:09] <Gurkenglas> when we find a systematic error in that correlation we call it a bias and call it a fallacy to use it
[15:23:12] <feep[work]> like, the model I could see is argumentative punch buggy
[15:23:18] <feep[work]> like what unsong and illuminatus tried to do
[15:23:38] <feep[work]> Gurkenglas: right, but by your metric as stated abusing fallacies is valid.
[15:23:40] <Gurkenglas> where did unsong try this? (never read illuminatus)
[15:23:44] <feep[work]> it's on the listener to correct for fallacies
[15:24:03] <feep[work]> Gurkenglas: like, unsong is an immunization for coincidences, illuminatus is an immunization for conspiracy theories
[15:24:15] <feep[work]> they both try to overload the reader with lots of verifiable facts that strongly imply insane things
[15:24:33] <feep[work]> in order to create backpressure to dampen the allure of coincidence
[15:24:43] <Gurkenglas> i see your point, and i agree that we should limit ourselves to reasoning people into opinions using only the parts of persuasiveness that correlate with truth.
[15:24:54] <feep[work]> oh okay
[15:24:57] <feep[work]> I have no objections to that~
[15:25:25] <feep[work]> anyway, I think scott explicitly states this in whatever post had the cool pyramid facts in

[15:28:15] <Gurkenglas> kuudes, also in the case of "for the sake of this argument..." i was still arguing for something true (and useful to those who don't believe disagree with me on ufai), because when i believe "A and B" and would ordinarily convince him of "A -> B" but he believes "not A" then convincing him of "(not A) -> B" also works

[15:32:26] <Khoth> Not if C and D are mutually exclusive or C is wildly improbable
[15:33:22] <Gurkenglas> ...fair, i was assuming that both C and D had no other effects from believing them than causing belief in "C or D"
[15:34:10] <Gurkenglas> but usually we're allowed to believe/argue for something where we've found a reason without having to look and fail to find reasons that believing it might be harmful!

[15:51:46] <nshepperd2> nah

[15:54:11] <nshepperd2> mostly you seem to wildly speculate about peoples beliefs and ask weird questions to which the answer is always 'mu'

[15:58:20] <Gurkenglas> bizarre hypotheticals is where i get my beliefs :D i think? i fail to recall an example. feel free to treat me with my own medicine, sounds nice
[16:03:15] <Gurkenglas> if i... found someone who could be reasoned into harming someone... would I? ...if we were doing collaborative problem-solving and therefore agreed ahead of time to try to be a reliable extension of each other's intelligence and therefore point out relevant consequences of each other's beliefs without considering other effects so that we don't have to pay attention to what the other person isn't saying, i 
[16:03:15] <Gurkenglas> suppose i would agree to such a promise and keep it
[16:08:32] <Gurkenglas> if we haven't... i would consider to what extent such an agreement exists unspoken, and trade off the betrayal of that unspoken agreement against the resulting harm, trying to avoid motivated cognition in either direction.
[16:09:31] <Gurkenglas> in the specific case of this channel... the norm seems to be clear that such an agreement does not exist unspoken, so i'd therefore stay silent and maybe cry a little at things being what they are.

[17:09:41] <kuudes> basicly people do not have any obligation to defend their beliefs to random people
[17:10:05] <kuudes> it is ok to just close the door to religion salesmen and shut the phone for cold callers
[17:11:02] <kuudes> it is helpful to challenge beliefs that affect your decisions in ways that are important to you, and then it may be useful to interact with pushy randos. but that is not the general case

[23:07:50] <rsaarelm> Non-Dilbert Scott hasn't really been much of a thing since the early 80s. 
[23:07:58] <rsaarelm> "Invented the interactive fiction genre"? The hell?
[23:08:25] <rsaarelm> Uh, Crowther and Woods?
[23:09:42] <rsaarelm> Okay, Adams was slightly earlier than Infocom, Adventureland was out in 1978, Infocom was founded in 1979.
[23:10:41] <rsaarelm> But everyone was getting started cloning Colossal Cave, like the article says...
[23:11:36] *** Quits: _inky (~inky_@5.77.222.175) (Ping timeout: 245 seconds)
[23:11:56] <rsaarelm> I think there was some stuff about Adams' return to interactive fiction recently and how the result was profoundly weird.
[23:12:42] <adiabatic> isn't IF profoundly weird already because it's kind of authors writing books for authors instead of authors writing books for readers
[23:13:48] <rsaarelm> Infocom was a thing back when he was originally active, and they had a more sophisticated system going on back then, but Adams' thing was being able to run off 8-bit cassette tapes which Infocom games couldn't do.
[23:14:07] <rsaarelm> adiabatic: Not sure what you mean.
[23:14:30] <adiabatic> writers writing to impress other writers, instead of writers going for a broader market
[23:14:31] <rsaarelm> Then there was the 90s hobbyist IF scene that pushed the Infocom quality standard even further.
[23:14:58] <adiabatic> This comes up when people ask "what IF should I start with?"
[23:15:02] <rsaarelm> I think the IF hobby scene had plenty of non-writer players, it was just a noncommercial niche after the early 90s.
[23:16:33] <rsaarelm> Then Adams shows up again decades later and I think he was still basically doing his early 80s 8-bit computer style IF, which was very limited even compared to the hobby scene state of the art then.
[23:17:31] <rsaarelm> But I guess doing "Christian games" was a savvy move, now he'd get money from parents buying games with good wholesome morals to kids at least for a little bit and wouldn't be that badly gimped by the games being horrid to actually play.
[23:18:49] <gwern> less competition too. and I doubt he wanted to follow games where they were going, towards _Doom_ etc
[23:19:19] <rsaarelm> Yeah, but he wasn't following towards Graham Nelson's Curses either.
[23:19:47] <gwern> might've been good just to renew his creativity a little. it's a common pattern for older creative types to move laterally into a closely connected but still distinct field, to shake themselves up and restore beginner's mind and escape their exhausted self-stereotypes
[23:20:01] <gwern> 'adventure games, but christian' is as good as any
[23:20:18] <rsaarelm> Reading media articles about adventure games is fun because more often than not the journalist has zero idea how you actually approach the game so they might do a gee whiz article about somethign that anyone who actually plays the games could peg as total crap.
[23:20:50] <rmmh> adiabatic: the answer to the correct IF to start with is '9:05'
[23:20:52] <gwern> I think the only people I've found really worth reading about adventure games thus far is filfre.net and the new 50 years of text adventures substacker
[23:21:19] <rsaarelm> Will basically never happen with fiction novels, and a journalist would probably be mortified if they had been unselfconsciously going off about how interesting and curious cultural phenomenom some total schlock novel is.
[23:21:29] <rsaarelm> Yeah, filfre is great.
[23:21:44] <rmmh> I think a lot of the interesting IF tech has moved into good dialog systems for games with richer media
[23:21:53] <rsaarelm> There was the SPAG newsletter 20 years ago that had good IF reviews, but it's dead now.

[23:23:47] <gwern> based on filfre's reaction to ai dungeon, I think IF is being left behind by DL
[23:24:16] <gwern> they're going to wake up in 2 or 3 years and realize that they've been missing the biggest opportunity since the z-machine was FLOSSed
[23:25:22] <rsaarelm> I think the parser IF scene has been pretty dead for a while now, it was lively from the mid-90s to the mid 00s, but I don't know of any notable recent works beyond the alchemy game by Plotkin.

[23:29:23] <rsaarelm> It's weird how plain and straightforward the new Christian Scott Adams adventure game sounds like based on that review. I'm immediately thinking of some thorny gnostic weirdness from religion mixed with IF, and then Adams thinks it's milquetoast puzzles mixed with bible quotes.
