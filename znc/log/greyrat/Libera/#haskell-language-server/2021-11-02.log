[13:21:58] <fendor> does hls perform auto import on identifiers?
[13:23:37] <fendor> context, I am reviewing student code and since this semester, a couple of them have import statements that are impossible for them to make on their own (e.g. imports stuff from Cabal or GHCi or glfw)
[13:24:13] <fendor> and I am suspecting they are using HLS, HLS sees an identifier and automatically imports, students undo the completion as it is bonkers, but the import remains
[13:24:31] <jneira[m]> hmm it may be the case
[13:24:38] <jneira[m]> i think it can be configured
[13:24:51] <jneira[m]> maybe we should set that to false by default
[13:26:41] <fendor> this way it is a terrible first experience for newcomers, either the completion needs to be a lot more accurate, or I don't think we should auto-import
[13:26:52] <fendor> or idk, auto import has its merits and I used it happily with typescript
[13:27:08] <jneira[m]> we have a pr to make them aware of types
[13:27:13] <jneira[m]> but still...
[13:27:56] <jneira[m]> uh still there is no pr
[13:28:24] <fendor> good autocompletion for haskell is probably really hard/expensive
[14:23:30] <mpickering> Is the problem that you get the suggestion
[14:23:38] <mpickering> and then you can select which import to use?
[14:23:41] <mpickering> and they choose the wrong one?
[14:36:44] <fendor> I suspect so, yes
[14:37:15] <fendor> Or rather, they type something, want to add a newline, which triggers the completion and the autocomplete
[14:37:44] <fendor> not that they use `do` but it used to happen to autocomplete `do` to some function call when you want to jump to the next line
[14:38:21] <fendor> s/and the autocomplete/and the auto-import/
[14:40:18] <jneira[m]> `haskell.plugin.ghcide-completions.config.autoExtendOn` will be the relevant config option
[14:40:39] <jneira[m]> "Extends the import list automatically when completing a out-of-scope identifier." https://haskell-language-server.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configuration.html#generic-plugin-configuration
[14:46:17] <fendor> I think the question is, which default is better. I can now only say that it does behave weirdly for newcomers
[14:47:22] <jneira[m]> if suggestions would take in account types they would be quite precise to setting it on by default
[14:56:11] <jneira[m]> https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server/issues/754
[14:57:30] <jneira[m]> i think shapr was interested in that improvement
[15:01:20] <fendor> I think everybody is interested in a type-directed auto-complete :D However, I suspect that this is a huge amount of work to do well
[15:01:44] <fendor> just showing the type would not resolve the issue I described, as students don't to the auto-imports on purpose
[15:02:23] <jneira[m]> oh, i see
[15:02:31] <fendor> *do  the auto-imports
[15:04:53] <jneira[m]> maybe a delay could help? otoh if you are using the same name and type as a included dependency definition, the autoimport will be suprising good news, no?
[15:05:23] <jneira[m]> there are things usually used as prefixes though: find. filter...
[15:08:55] <fendor> I don't what happened, but the imports are really completely insane. Such as `abiDepends`, `BooleanFlag` from Cabal...
[15:09:02] <fendor> *I dont know what happened
[15:09:49] <fendor> and abandonStmt from ghci

[16:24:08] <jneira[m]> hi!
[16:24:46] <michaelpj[m]> hey! I wanted to do some more work on lsp in the next few weeks. How do you feel about giving me merge perms so I can do issue triage and merge approved stuff?
[16:25:13] <jneira[m]> sounds great, i thought you already have!
[16:25:43] <michaelpj[m]> nope
[16:25:52] <michaelpj[m]> I have on HLS, but not on lsp
[16:26:30] <jneira[m]> i see, done!
[16:27:05] <michaelpj[m]> ðŸŽ‰
[16:27:08] <michaelpj[m]> thanks!
[16:30:16] <jneira[m]> thank you, lsp was needing some love lately :-)

[21:12:52] <jneira[m]> nice :-) 
[21:39:31] <michaelpj[m]> jneira: do we need to do anything in particular to get mergify working on lsp? Or do I basically just need to copy the config file from HLS? It makes the whole "branch must be up-to-date constraint" much less annoying :D
