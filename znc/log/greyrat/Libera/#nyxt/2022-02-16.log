[01:19:04] <lagash> What's the point in nx-search-engines to do (define-configuration (buffer web-buffer) ((search-engines ...))) vs just defining it on buffer? Doesn't web-buffer inherit from buffer anyways?
[01:19:39] <lagash> From https://github.com/aartaka/nx-search-engines#geting-started
[01:20:20] <lagash> I ask because I was playing around with Sly and noticed there were oddly-named classes like web-buffer20 that point to my search-engines.lisp and I'm guessing it's like a mixin or something??
[02:18:05] <jmercouris> lagash: nowadays it does
[02:18:12] <jmercouris> but in the past some slots did not exist
[02:18:27] <jmercouris> like different slots have been move around when the internal buffers got rearchitected

[20:01:31] <Kabouik> Oh damn, sorry to hear that jmercouris.
[20:02:39] <jmercouris> :-(
[20:02:48] <jmercouris> I’ll be fine
[20:03:02] <jmercouris> Soon I’m sure
[20:03:29] <Kabouik> I feel bad for even asking what that was about, I thought you were referring to some Nyxt development (or FOTD)
[20:06:26] <jmercouris> No
[20:06:30] <jmercouris> Don’t feel bad
[20:07:09] <jmercouris> It’s something we must all go through sometimes
[20:09:17] <Kabouik> I'm sure there must be an xkcd comic to make us both feel better now, there always is an xkcd comic to solve a situation
[20:12:31] <jmercouris> Lol
[20:12:42] <jmercouris> There’s usually something right
[20:12:54] <jmercouris> Just have to believe
[20:14:06] <Kabouik> https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/convincing.png Hum.
[20:14:42] <lagash> I thought it was about Atlas Engineer selling out to some bigger company :P
[20:27:58] <Kabouik> I recently upgraded Nyxt from master and it seems it no longer opens new buffers when I click on links in other programs, but instead opens a new window. is `%u` deprecated?
[20:31:03] <aartaka> Kabouik: I noticed that too. No, it's not deprecated, but it misbehaves somewhy. Care to file an issue?
[20:41:44] <jmercouris> Kabouik: that’s a good one :-)
