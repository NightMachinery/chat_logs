[01:51:51] <priconneplayer44> Hello friends I did a system update and my sound is no longer working
[01:52:12] <priconneplayer44> I have tried some basic troubleshooting steps (looking at pulseaudio systemctl logs and running it in a terminal emulator) but can't figure out what to do next

[03:46:52] <gehidore> what error is that

[03:47:12] <Namarrgon> why are you refreshing the keys?
[03:47:40] <Helenah> Namarrgon, As per arch wiki.
[03:47:50] <chazy> cuz when i try to do a system update it asks to import a PGP key but it just fails
[03:47:52] <Helenah> Ways to sort the problem I pasted apparently.
[03:47:59] <Namarrgon> Helenah: the arch wiki doesn't tell me what the output is on your system
[03:48:24] <Namarrgon> chazy: update the archlinux-keyring package first then -Su again

[13:14:50] <asd> my fresh install of arch linux is missing a bunch of tools k figured would br included. things such as fakeroot, patch, gcc, strace. gdb etc... is there a group of packages i should install that ive missed?
[13:15:37] <salkin> `base-devel` maybe?
[13:16:44] <mpan> asd: aside from what is required by the base install, Arch does not pre-install anything for you. You are supposed to install what you need. Packages in base-devel group, mentioned by salkin, are assumed to be present while building packages using `makepkg` and they may coincide with what you want, but that is not exactly what you want.
[13:17:01] <mpan> asd: just install the things that are needed for you. No one else can tell, what that is.
[13:17:22] <salkin> good point from mpan
[13:17:30] <asd> iirc my oldest arch install included more. but yes base-devel seems to be what i was missing
[13:17:43] <mpan> asd: you may use `pacman -F` (see help for `pacman -Fy` first) or pkgfile to determine which package contains a given file, if in doubt.

I've enabled strongswan.service. I've also tried enabling strongswan-starter.service but that doesn't seem to make a difference (and I've read something suggesting that this is "legacy").
[13:58:37] <ne2k> if it matters, my config is ipsec.conf based, rather than swanctl.conf based (as I hadn't heard of swanctl until I started looking into why this wasn't working)

[14:51:10] <roxlu> thanks grawity I was thinking that something like that was the problem. Using `arpscan -l` gives me a list that I can us to get the real ip

[17:41:53] <Furai> Namarrgon, when I've used hwclock --show it's the same time I can see on screen at the top gnome panel.
[17:42:00] <Furai> If that's what you ask.
[17:42:10] <Namarrgon> 'timedatectl' lists both

[17:42:54] <Furai> So I guess it's just that I don't sync my clock with some ntp server?

[17:44:38] <Furai> I think there's some confusion - I'm sure all the clock I can see on my system are in sync. It's just that 30s behind my actual clock that's synced over network.
[17:44:59] <Namarrgon> yes, just set up an ntp client

[20:31:56] <lmat> How does rsync send files over ssh? SSH is a shell, no? Shells aren't able to accept file transfers?
[20:32:12] <BrainDamage> it opens a pipe through a shell
[20:32:19] <BrainDamage> err, through ssh
[20:32:35] <BrainDamage> ssh is an encrypted pipe, which can attach to a shell ... or not

[20:32:57] <BrainDamage> and rsync connects to both endpoints and pipes data through stdbuf
[20:32:57] <jarshvor> Namarrgon: yes.. that confuses me since it seems to be very much using a venv.
[20:33:06] <lmat> BrainDamage: So rsync runs   cat > destfile; on the remote machine or something?
[20:33:19] *** Joins: boredcaveman (~boredcave@user/boredcaveman)
[20:33:21] <lmat> BrainDamage: Oh, or maybe rsync runs a server mode of rsync on the remote machine with which the client rsync communicates
[20:33:22] <BrainDamage> it runs rsync on the remote machine
[20:33:26] <jarshvor> I can even see so in /usr/lib/octoprint/pyvenv.cfg

[20:49:21] <NoImNotNineVolt> i don't know. it's typical for everything under /usr/lib to be owned by root:root, and there's nothing inherently problematic about a root-owned virtualenv...
[20:50:10] <NoImNotNineVolt> with the right permissions, other users should still be execute things in the virtualenv (but not modify it).
[20:50:10] <jarshvor> but if the user (octoprint in this case) using that env wants to write/update something then it cant cause root owns it?
[20:50:16] <NoImNotNineVolt> yes.
[20:50:45] <NoImNotNineVolt> ideally octoprint would write to its own octoprint-owned directory outside of /usr/lib.
[20:50:46] <jarshvor> so then there is something I am missing?
[20:50:51] <jarshvor> mmmm
[20:50:53] <jarshvor> I see
[20:51:00] <NoImNotNineVolt> i'm not familiar with octoprint specifically, sorry.
[20:51:16] <jarshvor> there is /var/lib/octoprint/.octoprint

[20:52:53] <jarshvor> I probably should not do a recursive chown to everything under /usr/lib/octoprint then right?
[20:53:03] <NoImNotNineVolt> i guess if octoprint uses pip to install plugins...
[20:53:09] <NoImNotNineVolt> then it'll need to write to /usr/lib to do that.
