[00:11:53] <sham1> Also, SRFI 13 being old-fashioned is why I was looking for 152 first
[00:12:55] <Zipheir> It also has SRFI 135, my personal favorite for large string-like things.
[00:13:17] <Zipheir> AKA (scheme text)
[00:13:39] <sham1> Isn't that the one dpk at least doesn't like
[00:15:04] <Zipheir> Maybe?  No idea why.
[00:15:58] <Zipheir> Clinger's sample implementation is awesome, although there are some things that would work much better if texts were built-in.
[00:16:48] <samph> In  SRFI-1, should `(null-list? '(a . b))` signal an error?  chibi seems to return #f
[00:22:52] <manumanumanu> Zipheir: 135 is a beauty! 
[00:25:05] <Zipheir> samph: Yes, that should be an error.

[00:32:12] <dpk> Clinger’s implementation of 135 is superb, but i nonetheless hope we end up with an R7RS where 135 isn’t necessary
[00:33:43] <samph> Zipheir: also it looks like the reference implementation returns #f
[00:38:03] <sham1> Since I'm not in the WG (and don't get any ideas), I'll just say that introducing proper immutable strings to R7 large would be very nice indeed.

[00:49:31] <Zipheir> The whole point of null-list? is that it's restricted to proper/circular lists.
[00:51:21] <Zipheir> Ah, I see.  If pair? is true then the sample imp. returns #f.  That's the bargain basement solution, I guess.

[20:52:07] <sham1> I've always wondered why the repls have so poor command line editing. Well, as in, no editing. Is it just because of the prevalence of Emacs and its ability to do the necessary editing of s-expressions in the repl?
[20:53:59] <mdhughes> Chez has a really nice editor. But most it's not even a consideration. You can integrate readline or CHICKEN has a "breadline" egg, but all that gets you is history and very limited line editing.
[20:55:35] <mdhughes> If the implementors are mostly script/file-based devs, they may not even realize the REPL is terrible.
[20:59:36] <Zipheir> sham1: Trying to avoid a readline dependency?
[21:00:08] <Zipheir> It's a surprisingly hairy feature.
[21:00:28] <sham1> You don't need the full readline to react to arrow keys or ^B or whatever
[21:00:50] <Zipheir> Hmm, yes, that would be helpful.
[21:01:21] <sham1> Even something as simple as auto-closing parentheses in the REPL would be a vast improvement on the experience
