[01:22:04] <Nobrem> hi
[01:22:17] <Nobrem> I was here yesterday, and asked a question, but the channel was totally dead.
[01:22:26] <Nobrem> So, before asking again, please allow me to ask:
[01:22:28] <Nobrem> Anyone here?
[01:24:09] <armin> no!
[01:24:11] <armin> https://open.spotify.com/track/3ZcD0mfwD88kafXHozt6up?si=f083adcbe9ce467f
[01:24:13] <murb> it pays to ask your question and wait for an answer!
[01:24:33] <Nobrem> sure, just wanted to make sure somebody is alive ;)
[01:24:39] <Nobrem> I am uploading a sample script - brb

[01:26:54] <Nobrem> https://dpaste.org/uYfX
[01:26:59] <Nobrem> ^ this is my test script
[01:27:13] <Nobrem> the video material I have here is a time lapse footage 15x sped up.
[01:27:26] <Nobrem> This means, that 4 seconds of video material equal 1 hour in real life  (if I am not mistaken)
[01:27:38] <Nobrem> So, I would like to add a minute-counter (followed by an hour counter) to the video
[01:28:05] <Nobrem> This test script which I pasted  (see above) shows my attempt to add a different text every 4 seconds
[01:29:13] <Nobrem> The folder "jpgs" will then contain every frame of the video as a single JPG
[01:29:54] <Nobrem> the problem:  There are gaps between the numbers without numbers
[01:31:44] <Nobrem> for some reason,  I only get a "0" until frame 91
[01:32:30] <Nobrem> and then there are empty frames
[01:34:17] <Nobrem> UPDATED version:  https://dpaste.org/MPXN
[01:34:29] <Nobrem> This version has more reasonable seconds
[01:34:38] <Nobrem> but: there is always a frame with 2 numbers
[01:34:50] <Nobrem> for example, a frame that shows 0 and 1 concurrently
[01:34:57] <Nobrem> or 1 and 2 concurrently
[01:35:25] <Nobrem> Can I specify that in FRAMES rather than seconds?
[01:35:49] <Nobrem> then I could, instead of letting it end at 4 seconds,  let it end at  ((4 seconds * 30 fps) - 1 frame)

[01:39:14] *** Quits: fkaa (~Srain@user/fkaa) (Remote host closed the connection)
[01:39:37] <furq> Nobrem: n is frame number
[01:39:58] <furq> but also you could just drop the timeline stuff and use text='%{eif\:n/100\:d}'
[01:40:18] <Nobrem> furq, thank you so much for talking with me!!!!
[01:40:25] <Nobrem> furq, I have been trying to solve this for _days_!
[01:40:38] <Nobrem> thank you so much for responding, being here, taking the time, thank you soooooo much!!
[01:40:55] <Nobrem> you said "n" were frames... does this mean:
[01:41:14] <Nobrem> instead of  enable='between(t, 0, 4)'   I would use:   enable='between(n, 0, 119)'
[01:41:28] <furq> for 30fps sure
[01:41:33] <Nobrem> I was looking up and down the ffmpeg manual but I failed to find it!
[01:41:42] <furq> but like i said you can do it with just one drawtext
[01:41:51] *** Joins: System_Error (~SystemErr@user/systemerror)
[01:41:53] <Nobrem> I love ffmpeg so much,  but the manual is so ... it has so much room for improvement
[01:42:06] <Nobrem> I was looking for days to find this
[01:42:18] <Nobrem> furq: could you please explain text='%{eif\:n/100\:d}' ?
[01:42:20] <furq> text='%{eif\:n/120\:d}' will draw whatever floor(n/120) is
[01:42:33] <furq> so 0 between frames 0 and 119, 1 between 120 and 239, etc
[01:42:33] <Nobrem> furq, I am not sure if that will work.
[01:42:40] <Nobrem> furq, can I please tell you the whole idea?
[01:42:59] <furq> sure why not
[01:43:00] <Nobrem> Everything below 59 minutes,  I would like to display minutes
[01:43:16] <Nobrem> I think I should not show anything for the first 59 seconds
[01:43:21] <Nobrem> so, 59 seconds of nothingness
[01:43:30] <Nobrem> then it will show:  " 1 Minute"
[01:43:40] <furq> oh right
[01:43:48] <Nobrem> another 4 seconds later:  " 2 Minutes"  (with an "s" at the end)
[01:44:00] <Nobrem> After 59 Minutes, it should jump to  "1 Hour"
[01:44:00] <furq> if you need words and not just numbers then doing it with expr is probably going to end up more complex
[01:44:13] <furq> you could do it by burning in subtitles though
[01:44:24] <furq> that's normally a better answer than a giant drawtext incantation
[01:44:37] <Nobrem> furq, at the moment, I am using a bash script to generate a loooong ffmpeg command
[01:44:47] <Nobrem> I am not even sure, if my approach makes sense.
[01:44:54] <furq> you might be better off generating an srt file and then burning that in with -vf subtitles
[01:45:19] <Nobrem> that sounds like a great idea!
[01:45:39] <Nobrem> so, I could create multiple srt files for the various speeds (4x speed, 10x speed, 15x speed, etc.)
[01:45:43] <Nobrem> and then I burn these subtitles in?
[01:45:52] <furq> sure
[01:45:56] <Nobrem> Can I still decide on the font and the background color?
[01:45:59] <furq> yeah
[01:46:02] <Nobrem> it must be a monospace font
[01:46:03] <furq> and the positioning etc
[01:46:05] <Nobrem> wow
[01:46:23] <furq> https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-filters.html#subtitles-1
[01:47:11] <furq> actually you might need to generate ass subtitles for positioning
[01:47:21] <furq> that's not much more complex though
[01:47:46] <Nobrem> I am reading
[01:48:01] <Nobrem> please, please, please don't run off,  nobody in the past couple of days knew anything about this
[01:48:08] <furq> nvm you can do it with -force_style
[01:48:11] <Nobrem> I am so grateful that you are here
[01:48:47] <Nobrem> There is one more thing I should explain, though
[01:48:51] <Nobrem> Maybe this changes everything
[01:49:17] <Nobrem> So, my footage is (most of the time) taken at a speed of 4x.   The resulting videos are often more than 2 hours long.
[01:49:25] <Nobrem> The final cut will often be only 10 minutes long
[01:49:32] *** Joins: lavaball (felix@31.204.155.215)
[01:49:47] <Nobrem> My idea was, like I showed you,  to add text to every frame in ffmpeg
[01:49:57] <Nobrem> then I would speed the videos up to the desired speeds
[01:50:15] <Nobrem> this way, I can speed up some parts to 30x,  others to 200x,  others to 100x
[01:50:32] <Nobrem> this way, I could make sure, the timestamps (minutes / hours) will always be correct after speeding up the videos
[01:50:56] <Nobrem> I failed to find a suitable solution in programs like shotcut
[01:51:11] <Nobrem> But, I am afraid this could be a waste of computing time on my computer
[01:51:23] <Nobrem> Imagine adding text to a 4K footage of 2 hours,  twice / day
[01:51:27] <furq> depends how much disk space you have
[01:51:37] <Nobrem> 2 TB maximum,  but not SSD
[01:51:58] <Nobrem> I am more concerned about: "How long will ffmpeg need to run the command" ?
[01:52:06] <furq> that's what depends
[01:52:06] <Nobrem> I guess roughly 20+ hours per video
[01:52:20] <furq> it'll be a few minutes if you export to a lossless format
[01:52:29] <furq> but if it's 4k then the video will be enormous
[01:52:59] <Nobrem> that won't work then
[01:53:17] <Nobrem> I am already running out of space, and I am poor as a mouse under the bridge
[01:53:25] <Nobrem> So, I can't buy a new hard drive for now
[01:53:49] <furq> uncompressed would be like 2.7TB
[01:54:02] <Nobrem> ouch. no way.
[01:54:04] <furq> any fast lossless codec would probably be no better than half that
[01:54:22] <Nobrem> furq, so, if the final videos will only be roughly 10 minutes long... how can I do it better?
[01:54:38] <Nobrem> as final step,  I would like to tell ffmpeg to cut out pieces of the video and speed them up
[01:54:43] <Nobrem> maybe I should add the text after this?
[01:55:41] <Nobrem> ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -r 30 -filter:v "setpts=0.25*PTS" 4x_faster.mp4
[01:56:10] <Nobrem> before that, I usually crop the videos:
[01:56:29] <furq> you can burn in the subtitles in that command
[01:56:34] <Nobrem> time ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -ss 00:30:20 -to 00:50:22 -c:v copy -an out.mp4
[01:56:46] <furq> oh maybe not then
[01:57:06] <Nobrem> I have 2-3 camera angles
[01:57:10] <Nobrem> and they get all cut together
[01:57:21] <Nobrem> I would cut out a piece here, and a piece there
[01:57:23] <furq> i guess you could just make one two-hour long subtitle file and then seek to the same timestamps in the subtitles
[01:58:14] <Nobrem> I am positive I could even generate such a subtitles file in a shell script on the go
[01:58:30] <Nobrem> if -ss time starts at 00:30:00  I know that I must generate subtitles starting from there
[01:59:08] <furq> sure
[01:59:16] <furq> but you can seek in subtitles and rebase the timestamps of subtitles
[01:59:21] <furq> so that's also worth thinking about
[01:59:41] <Nobrem> furq: Do you want me to try to get it to work myself,  or would you mind giving me a one-liner that burns monospace-font with formatting into a video?
[02:00:04] <Nobrem> furq, how seek and rebase?  They are a text file, aren't they?
[02:00:09] <hiya> Is it possible to pack libraries / codecs with standard Firefox statically to play all sort of videos, even if OS doesn't have media codecs installed
[02:01:41] <furq> -vf "subtitles=subtitles.srt:force_style='Alignment=7,OutlineColour=&H100000000,BorderStyle=3,Outline=1,Shadow=0,Fontsize=24'"
[02:01:44] <furq> or something like that
[02:02:17] <Nobrem> thank you so much, furq
[02:03:33] <Nobrem> feedback comes soon,  I am just creating an srt file
[02:05:09] <Nobrem> how important are the milliseconds in the "srt-file" ?
[02:05:28] <Nobrem> I want to avoid gaps between the texts,  but also I want to avoid showing two numbers concurrently in the same frame
[02:05:37] <Nobrem> like "0" and "1" being displayed above each other
[02:05:54] <furq> idk i've never needed them to be frame perfect
[02:06:08] <furq> i think 0.999 and 1.000 shouldn't overlap
[02:06:23] <Nobrem> #
[02:06:40] <Nobrem> furq, I would like to take roughly 2 hours of my time to get it to work.
[02:06:45] <Nobrem> if I still fail,  could I come back?
[02:06:49] <Nobrem> Or will you be gone already?

[16:26:52] <GuiToris> the first file (1.wav) is about 5 minutes long, so as the final output 123.wav
[16:35:38] <bertieb_> can WAV format be concatted that way? (I don't know off top of my head)
[16:35:43] *** bertieb_ is now known as bertieb
[16:36:01] <JEEB> it's a protocol level concat so most likely it gets stopped at where the first document ends
[16:36:17] <JEEB> concat demuxer might be able to cope with it since each file gets separately opened as WAV
[16:36:26] <JEEB> IFF the values are the same for the audio properties

[20:04:32] <stevessss> so.. I have gopro 360 videos from gopro max.. on gopro player it sees 360 degrees around and can be mapped to a 360 view... on linux its supposed to be 5k wide but cropps to 4k rstricing my view to 288 degrees out of 360 degress around.. thus I cant see streight back
[20:05:05] <stevessss> my resolve 360 to flat mapper lets me play the low-ress fisheye views fine, but not the 360 cylindrical videos.. is this likely a codec bug?

[20:07:41] <stevessss> https://studio213.us/GS030009.360  thats the 360--file in question that crops the sides of the 360 view to see streight back without me asking
[20:07:55] <stevessss> I end up haivng to use windows to transcode before I can open in resolve
[20:10:57] <stevessss> https://www.trekview.org/blog/2021/reverse-engineering-gopro-360-file-format-part-1/  guess there is some more trickery here.. I'll use my mac to transcode
[20:11:03] *** Joins: System_Error (~SystemErr@user/systemerror)
[20:13:27] <stevessss> guess I use gopro player to "export" to 5.6k hevc and then davinci and kdenlive and other linux apps can re-map 360 view

[22:16:03] <zetaE> hello
[22:16:31] <zetaE> is there an open source DLSS implementation?
[22:17:07] *** Quits: nrg (~NRG@user/nrg) (Quit: ZNC - https://znc.in)
[22:18:12] <zetaE> akin to nvidia DLSS or radeon FSR
[22:18:19] *** Joins: nrg (~NRG@user/nrg)
[22:18:20] <zetaE> ffmpeg is falling behind
[22:19:30] <furq> there's lots of oss ml upscaling stuff
[22:19:33] <furq> most of it is slow though
[22:20:53] <zetaE> furq: any presets around to ready to use from let's say 470 -> 720 resolution?
[22:21:03] <JEEB> IIRC FSR was just some fancier scaler, not even NN based
[22:21:06] <zetaE> just like nvidia DLSS youtube vids?
[22:21:12] <JEEB> zetaE: try out nnedi3?
[22:21:19] <JEEB> you just need the weights from znedi f.ex.
[22:21:27] <JEEB> (or you train the neural network yourself)
[22:21:47] <JEEB> alternatively you utilize the libplacebo based video filter and utilize some meme shaders :)
[22:23:21] <zetaE> libplacebo, meme shaders, are you being funny?
[22:23:32] <JEEB> not really
[22:23:46] <JEEB> libplacebo because in reality nobody notices if video stuff gets done correctly
[22:24:12] <JEEB> meme shaders since I'm not sure how much better the neural network shaders actually are VS nicer scaling algorithms in libplacebo or zscale
[22:24:55] <haasn> my rec would be FSRCNNX
[22:24:58] <zetaE> JEEB: ah alright, libplacebo is a real library, I thought you were pulling my leg
[22:25:08] <haasn> scrap NNEDI3
[22:25:27] <JEEB> well, nnedi3 is just already with a CPU based implementation in FFmpeg, that's why I mentioned it
[22:25:35] <JEEB> although yes, it's been around since what.... 2008-9?
[22:25:37] <zetaE> actually I wanted for ocr stuff :/
[22:27:24] <zetaE> does linux have any gpu accel working? open source
[22:27:35] <JEEB> what do you mean with "gpu accel"
[22:27:37] <zetaE> without using the blob drivers
[22:28:12] <zetaE> radeon, got the opencl crippled, nouveau, well ...
[22:29:34] <haasn> mesa+vulkan
[22:30:01] <JEEB> we don't even know what he actually means :P

[22:34:14] <zetaE> gpu hardware transcoding and processing
[22:34:40] <JEEB> do you mean gpgpu or actual format specific hardware for decoding and encoding?
[22:36:38] <JEEB> because gpgpu based decoding and encoding mostly died out because to actually get good perf out of GPUs with that you need to actually design a format around being well run'able on such hardware
[22:37:36] <JEEB> for the actual decoding and encoding blocks on the hardware, both intel and amd have open source frameworks for utilizing that hardware, although I think at this point both require initial firmware so you initialize the hardware (I think that's why intel's vaapi driver is patched in debian?) :P
[22:38:03] <JEEB> nvidia has open source nvdec/enc APIs but the driver is blobs
[22:38:33] <JEEB> for processing you can just take a look at the libplacebo video filter, currently utilizing vulkan
[22:38:44] <JEEB> (such as scaling, color space conversions etc)
