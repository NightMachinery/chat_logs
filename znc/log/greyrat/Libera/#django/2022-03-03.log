[12:49:08] <pycode1> does anyone have experience with such tools?
[12:50:08] <pycode1> i know using htmx makes life easier, but as i said with cannot use that tool to load everything dinamically (xhr) with refreshing etc..

[13:16:50] <Timvde> Hi. We have a Q object: Q(contract_id__in=Subscription.objects.filter(...).values_list('contract_id')). The issue is that the values_list becomes *very* large, resulting in a multi-megabyte query. Is there a way to not eagerly evaluate the values_list, but create the same Q object where the query is inlined?
[13:20:38] <wez> Timvde: It could be values_list doing it. Can you use values instead?
[13:21:40] <Timvde> wez: Yes, it's the values_list that's doing the eager evaluation for sure :) I'm just looking for an alternative. I don't think values will be any better, though? That will surely also eagerly evaluate.
[13:22:36] <wez> Try it and see?  I can't see any mention of eager loading in the docs: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/ref/models/querysets/#django.db.models.query.QuerySet.values
[13:25:10] <Timvde> Hmm, but both create a QuerySet
[13:25:31] <Timvde> You are right, it should not eagerly evaluate
[13:25:42] <Timvde> Now I'm just more confused :D
[13:26:25] <Timvde> I did find this in the meantime: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/ref/models/expressions/#limiting-a-subquery-to-a-single-column

[13:37:12] <pycode1> for i do not know if it is ok to improve "ui" i mean ... i have seen many saas platform and react/vue are, basically always used
[13:47:13] <mrwick> pycode1: either way, if something is needed from htmx that does not come out of the box, then it's js programming. so why not just write straight js? (or jsx)

[13:48:13] <theprophet> what is the differences between views.py in django project directory and views.py in django app directory?
[13:49:00] <theprophet> i was learning from django documentation , but i saw a video where this guy creates his views.py in django project directory
[13:49:33] <theprophet> where i learn that views.py is automaticly created in app directory but never heard of anybody making views.py file in django project directory
[13:49:48] <theprophet> can somebody shred a little light on that for me?
[13:50:07] <gordonjcp> well
[13:50:23] <gordonjcp> I guess you could import the views from the very top level
[13:50:55] <theprophet> hmm
[13:51:28] <theprophet> weird
[13:57:38] <pycode1> mrwick, the "problem" in my case is the UI, i would like to create a platform that does not need refreshes etc..
[13:58:05] <pycode1> i can do xhr with htmx but i cannot call /platform and then load ALL the other things with XHR
[13:58:42] <pycode1> for example having a navbar and then load the content via xhr it will be a pain because...ok it is possible but the url remain the same /platform
[13:58:59] <pycode1> so i think a frameowrk like Vue is needed for saas platform
[13:59:44] <pycode1> refreshing everything for every page is not the "standard" now... (i know it is the wrong term...but as i said all the other platform have been built with Vue/React)
[14:00:00] <pycode1> so i think there is a reason
[14:03:39] <FunkyBob> theprophet: the difference is... nothing, really
[14:03:57] <FunkyBob> theprophet: it's all python... keeping it in one place or another is just organisation
[14:04:06] <theprophet> FunkyBob yeah, i just found out, what is it for, thanks.
[14:04:10] <FunkyBob> note that doesn't apply to _everything_
[14:05:12] <FunkyBob> pycode1: nothing stopping you updating the URL to match the current page state
[14:05:14] <theprophet> it was confusing because, i tought u suppose to make app first inorder to actually see views in webpage
[14:05:32] <FunkyBob> theprophet: urls, views, forms... can be anywhere, since your code imports it
[14:05:38] <theprophet> yea
[14:05:42] <FunkyBob> it's only things django "discovers" that must be in "well known" locations
[14:05:49] <FunkyBob> like models, templates, tags libraries
[14:05:55] <FunkyBob> static
[14:06:31] <theprophet> yea , well i would have figure that out but , this guy had not imported anything, cause he had no app made yet.
[14:07:08] <FunkyBob> if you don't have any models, etc... you don't need one
[14:07:09] <theprophet> and i used to fact that views.py was made in app directory
[14:07:27] <theprophet> FunkyBob yea, now i know it. and thank you too..
[14:07:28] <FunkyBob> congrats, you just leveled up in understanding Django :)
[14:07:43] <theprophet> <3
[14:11:07] <pycode1> FunkyBob, yes but i think i am adding many things that a js framework already do... idk
[14:11:31] <pycode1> i know i will add complexity...i do not want it but i also hav to pay attention to UI ...so...idk
[14:11:59] <FunkyBob> some might, some don't
[14:12:03] <FunkyBob> react doesn't, for instance
[14:12:38] <pycode1> FunkyBob, what not? are you talking about complexity?
[14:14:21] <pycode1> FunkyBob, do you use React? i am studying DRF I really like it ....but now i have found htmx too so i am a bit confused about what stack to adopt, :D but as i said basically all the saas platform are using a js framework hmm
[14:18:41] <FunkyBob> yes, I use react at work
[14:19:08] <FunkyBob> sure, they use JS... for various reasons
[14:20:14] <FunkyBob> a SPA can be a better UX for some applications... especially consoles

[17:21:53] <GinFuyou> jim, your question_id is not defined at glance
[17:24:20] <GinFuyou> Also I'm intrigued what is the purpose of dict_list being defined as list of tuples?
[17:29:51] <jim> hi
[17:31:01] <jim> well I guess the question is why am I getting a NoReverseMatch exception from {% url 'detail' question_id %}?
[17:32:02] <jim> GinFuyou, it's so that at the end, I can turn it into the dict to pass as 'context'
[17:32:50] <jim> and I have other questions, what is being reversed? and matched?
[17:33:09] <jim> I guess this whole area has me confused
[17:34:03] <GinFuyou> jim, because question_id is not defined, it tries to make an url for detail without an id, and url patterns don't have such case
[17:34:31] <jim> oh, an undefined variable?
[17:34:41] <jim> ok let's see
[17:35:22] <GinFuyou> >  turn it into the dict - but you can make it a dict from the start? why complicate things?
[17:36:01] <jim> well I think it's that I don't have enough info to be able to combine two dicts

[17:40:41] <GinFuyou> GinFuyou, yes, but given it's in a loop, you probably just want question.pk

[17:56:40] <GinFuyou> https://susepaste.org/50245698
[17:57:51] <GinFuyou> {% url %} is DTL analogue of reverse() function, so when error talks about reverse it's usually about one of those

[19:37:19] <jim> How do I specify how many args a template needs?
[19:37:40] <jim> and in the template, how do I get those args?
[19:37:54] <dodo> args?
[19:38:02] <dodo> context vars?
[19:39:58] <jim> like in (% url 'someapp:sometemplate.html' (I guess args go here) %}
[19:40:34] <dodo> urls are for views, not templates
[19:41:24] <dodo> jim: this is how you reverse urls https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/ref/templates/builtins/#url
[19:41:28] <jim> so, urls are for views, and views are for templates?
[19:41:46] <jim> I will read that
[19:41:52] <dodo> well, not all views use templates, but yes
[19:42:09] <dodo> as for accessing request args in the template, your view has to add them to the template, or you add the whole request object
[19:42:40] *** Joins: dez (uid92154@user/dez)
[19:43:19] <dodo> i think there is some context processor that adds the request object
[19:43:37] <dodo> ah yes https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/ref/templates/api/#django-template-context-processors-request
[19:47:04] <jim> and then the template iterates over the request args, in the case you pass the whole request?
[19:48:58] <dodo> why do you want to do this anyway?
[19:49:25] <jim> me?
[19:49:29] <dodo> yes
[19:49:41] <jim> whell I just want to understand how the system works
[19:49:50] <dodo> mh, ok
[19:49:54] <dodo> go read this too https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/ref/request-response/#httprequest-objects
[19:50:03] <dodo> usually you don't need the request object at all
[19:50:03] <jim> ok
[19:50:18] <dodo> normally, your view passes some object to the template that contains all the info you need
[19:50:24] <dodo> or a list of objects
[19:51:02] <dodo> jim: have you done the tutorial yet?
[19:51:09] <jim> you mean it doesn't have to be passed to the template? or, that once you get that far (to the url), that the request has done its job?

[22:44:03] <apocalyptech> Hello all!  So I've got an app which opens a popup (when requested by the user) whose content is in my staticfiles.
[22:44:28] <apocalyptech> Django add a `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin` header to pages it serves up from within its framework, but does *not* add that header to static-served content.
[22:45:13] <apocalyptech> Thus, Javascript on the main app can't talk to content on the popup.  If I set `SECURE_CROSS_ORIGIN_OPENER_POLICY = 'same-origin-allow-popups'` in `settings.py`, things start working just fine...
[22:45:29] <apocalyptech> ... but I'd kind of like to stick with the default and have that COOP header get sent along with static content instead.
[22:46:11] <apocalyptech> Is there a reasonable way to accomplish that?  Been googling around for a bit and the solutions I've found seem awfully hokey, and I'd sort of rather just override the value in my site settings.
