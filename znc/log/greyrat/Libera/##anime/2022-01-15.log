[06:57:15] <Fenderbassist> that's good

[07:01:03] <Fenderbassist> sounds good Butter, I didn't know you had cats, I love em though I'm allergic
[07:01:23] <Fenderbassist> amigojapan: you probably are eating lower calorie foods, better quality stuff

[07:02:33] <jbwncster> Hi
[07:02:46] <jbwncster> I found a great instant ramen brand
[07:02:51] <jbwncster> Called naked
[07:02:59] <jbwncster> Only issue is the amount of salt
[07:03:22] <Fenderbassist> is it made of bleached white flour noodles pre-cooked in lard?
[07:03:33] <jbwncster> It‚Äôs got egg noodles
[07:03:39] <Fenderbassist> that sounds much better

[07:06:44] <Fenderbassist> that looks very good, thank you
[07:07:03] <Fenderbassist> I often bought Naked brand fruit/vegetable juices, not sure if it's the same brand
[07:07:32] <jbwncster> Nope
[07:07:44] <Fenderbassist> ok, good to know
[07:08:49] <jbwncster> I asked them on Facebook messenger where to get them
[07:08:59] <jbwncster> Cause I want to try stuff not sold at Walmart
[07:09:19] <Fenderbassist> I can understand, I don't shop at Walmart myself
[07:09:39] <jbwncster> I use their delivery service since I don‚Äôt have a car
[07:09:48] <jbwncster> No up charge
[07:09:52] <Fenderbassist> that works
[07:10:02] <Fenderbassist> you can avoid the crowds that way
[07:10:18] <jbwncster> I do not want to Uber to the grocery
[07:10:34] <Fenderbassist> of course, adds to the cost
[07:10:58] <jbwncster> $98 a year for unlimited delivery
[07:11:18] <Fenderbassist> you can make that work then if you do it frequently
[07:11:30] <jbwncster> they also take ebt
[07:11:50] <Fenderbassist> yes I see more and more places doing that now
[07:11:53] <Fenderbassist> which only makes sense

[07:15:04] <Fenderbassist> back on Conquer Online, you could add Turtle Gems to armor slots to improve damage reduction, not the same thing but a somehwat similar build

[07:45:46] <ButterNoodle> best line from that "some like to watch budding, meshita likes to watch withering"

[07:49:26] *** Quits: Sxem (~sxem@pool-108-31-231-10.washdc.fios.verizon.net) (Quit: Leaving)
[07:50:10] <Fenderbassist> amigojapan: I think it comes down to a sensible diet, for example I switched from a keto diet to a high protein/low carb/moderate fat diet and lost weight easier while working out
[07:50:24] <Fenderbassist> I kept calories below 2400 a day
[07:50:33] <Fenderbassist> and pumped iron
[07:51:01] <amigojapan> I see Fenderbassist , we even ate Christmas cake
[07:51:07] <Fenderbassist> a little bit is fine
[07:51:15] <Fenderbassist> doing it every day is where you run into trouble
[07:51:25] <Fenderbassist> cake every day = weight
[07:51:37] <Fenderbassist> cake once in a great while = probably not a problem
[07:51:55] <Fenderbassist> Butter says he does regular carb cycles, so he would be the one to talk to about it
[07:52:28] <amigojapan> I see
[07:52:39] <Fenderbassist> he knows a lot more about it than I
[07:53:04] <amigojapan> Fenderbassist: I wish cake was not fatening :(
[07:53:12] <Fenderbassist> find a substitute
[07:53:23] <Fenderbassist> something sweetened with Stevia instead of Sugar
[07:53:36] <Fenderbassist> and with less undesirable carbs
[07:54:17] <Fenderbassist> again, Butter is the master in this area
[07:56:05] <amigojapan> Fenderbassist: unfortunately strawberries were expresive now, so I did not get them
[07:56:08] <Fenderbassist> jbwncster: so far so good, thank you for introducing me to this anime
[07:56:22] <Fenderbassist> jbwncster: it's very much like the kinds of online games I used to play years ago
[07:56:43] <Fenderbassist> amigojapan: I can understand, there will be shortages and price hikes on a number of things now
[07:56:51] <Fenderbassist> certainly is true here
[07:57:07] <amigojapan> Ouch
[07:57:39] <jbwncster> Also inflation
[07:57:44] <jbwncster> Food costs way more now
[07:57:44] <amigojapan> Fenderbassist: last year we ate a lot of strawberries

[07:58:19] <amigojapan> jbwncster: what's that?
[07:58:40] <jbwncster> A yogurt drink
[07:58:47] <amigojapan> Ah
[07:58:51] <jbwncster> $57 for 14 items today
[07:59:34] <amigojapan> jbwncster: I spent about 30usd but I may still go to buy fruit somewhere
[07:59:43] <jbwncster> Where are you?
[07:59:48] <amigojapan> Japan
[07:59:51] <jbwncster> Ah
[07:59:58] <jbwncster> Is it cheaper there than usa ?
[08:00:06] <jbwncster> Don‚Äôt buy the $100 fruit lol
[08:00:44] <amigojapan> In the past Japan was now expensive than USA, but I have not been in USA in 20 years
[08:01:08] <jbwncster> I bought 14 items at Walmart and paid $57
[08:01:11] <amigojapan> More expensive*
[08:01:28] <amigojapan> jbwncster: sounds expresive
[08:01:35] <Fenderbassist> amigojapan: just so you know, the last time you were in USA you left a light on in a room, 20 years later the bill comes to 1,000,000 USD :)

[08:09:11] <Fenderbassist> I find that helpful
[08:09:20] <jbwncster>  But you have to cook most of them
[08:09:24] <Fenderbassist> when I have a protein source I add vegetables
[08:09:31] <Fenderbassist> I sometimes eat them raw
[08:09:38] <Fenderbassist> tomatoes, onions, bell peppers
[08:09:40] <jbwncster> You can‚Äôt eat all of them raw
[08:09:44] <Fenderbassist> it all depends
[08:09:48] <Fenderbassist> on what you want I guess
[08:09:50] <jbwncster> No raw potatoes
[08:09:55] <Fenderbassist> I don't eat potatoes
[08:10:04] <amigojapan> Potatoes are carbs
[08:10:06] <jbwncster> I often mix tofu and chicken because chicken is pricy
[08:10:19] <Fenderbassist> tomatoes, onions, bell peppers, carrots, romaine lettuce
[08:10:24] <Fenderbassist> are what I usually get

[08:12:56] <Nanobot> Due to the Botan incident, Laplus Darkness issued an apology on stream and announced that she will be leaving permanently. Basic summary of what happened: During her recent Left 4 Dead 2 collab, her faulty Internet connection somehow triggered a software bug that caused Botan to appear on Laplus' stream wearing a new outfit that had not yet been revealed. In response, Laplus will be leaving for a new apartment where she can get a better Internet connection.

[08:18:50] <Nanobot> Digimon?
[08:19:04] <Nanobot> Yamada is one of the most generic Japanese names.
[08:19:04] <jbwncster> Yamada is a character in digimon
[08:19:13] <jbwncster> Aka Matt
[08:19:25] <amigojapan> Tamara is a common Japanese name
[08:19:29] <Fenderbassist> I suspect the name Yamada has a deeper etymology
[08:19:40] <Fenderbassist> since it's been  used so much
[08:19:49] <amigojapan> Yamada*
[08:20:19] <jbwncster> I like the name kaede
[08:20:20] <Nanobot> They call her Yamada because in her debut, she told everyone to respond to her orders with "YES MY DARK!" The chat immediately started abbreviating it "YMD", which quickly turned into "Yamada"
[08:20:29] <amigojapan> Fenderbassist: it means mountain rice field
[08:21:01] <Fenderbassist> amigojapan: sounds like my food pantry :)

[08:39:44] <MootPoot> Well that's mostly how it works
[08:39:47] <Satin> and I'm still 10 lbs down overall
[08:40:05] <MootPoot> Reach like significantly under your target weight
[08:40:07] <Satin> it's mostly just mental health things, when i'm especially stressed and directionless i can't follow up on my routine

[09:13:25] <amigojapan> Fenderbassist: recently I have gotten used to not having coffee
[09:13:38] <Fenderbassist> taking a break can be good
[09:13:49] <Fenderbassist> I also haven't had coffee in a few months, have been mostly drinking water
[09:14:04] <amigojapan> I see
[09:14:18] <amigojapan> Fenderbassist: I like milk
[09:14:20] <Fenderbassist> every day is a day for coffee, but my coffee maker broke and I just didn't get around to replacing it and the grinder and the whole bean coffee I normally had
[09:14:36] <Fenderbassist> I gave up milk a long time ago, but I do have half & half with coffee
[09:15:14] <Fenderbassist> amigojapan: just watch the amount of carbs in milk if you're doing keto
[09:15:20] <amigojapan> Fenderbassist: I just split a litter of milk with tomako
[09:15:40] <Fenderbassist> cool
[09:16:30] <Fenderbassist> whole milk, 2%, or 1% fat?
[09:16:55] <amigojapan> Fenderbassist: they don't write that on the packs in Japan
[09:17:21] <Fenderbassist> do they indicate how much fat per serving?
[09:17:37] <amigojapan> Maybe. Let me see
[09:18:49] <amigojapan> Fenderbassist: 3.9g of fat per 100millileters
[09:20:17] <Fenderbassist> that would be whole milk
[09:20:20] <Fenderbassist> no fat removed
[09:20:29] <Fenderbassist> good for keto
[09:20:38] <Fenderbassist> just watch the carbs
[09:20:45] <Fenderbassist> lactose is a sugar
[09:20:52] <Fenderbassist> so count your carbs
[09:21:03] <Fenderbassist> otherwise I'd say you're good sir

[09:26:04] <amigojapan> Fenderbassist: perfect for hobbyists
[09:27:14] <Fenderbassist> amigojapan: so if you already own a domain, you're giving it up to just use one of countless subdomains....if you don't own a domain, it's a great way for hobbyists to get their own URL link

[09:33:07] <Fenderbassist> go Mazda instead

[09:34:57] <Fenderbassist> I have my first one, and I love it
[09:35:02] <Fenderbassist> a CX-5
[09:35:07] <amigojapan> Nice
[09:35:10] <Fenderbassist> best of class per Consumer Reports
[09:35:16] <MootPoot> my family has had mazdas, hyndais, toyotas, and suzukis

[09:35:28] <MootPoot> although quite frankyl, most of them are boring as shit
[09:35:29] <Fenderbassist> MootPoot: reliable cars
[09:35:37] <MootPoot> the suzuki was fun
[09:35:39] <JesseDesu> camry ftw
[09:35:41] <Fenderbassist> yeah I guess it's a tradeoff
[09:35:44] <MootPoot> JesseDesu: old man car
[09:35:56] <Fenderbassist> reliability vs cool factor
[09:35:57] <JesseDesu> subaru wrx then
[09:36:09] <Fenderbassist> they're not Ferrari's
[09:36:11] <MootPoot> I'd be okay with a hot hatch or something but ideally I'd like no car 
[09:36:15] <MootPoot> so much extra money
[09:36:23] <Fenderbassist> motorcycle?
[09:36:31] <MootPoot> yeah, maybe motorcycle
[09:37:13] <MootPoot> the problem with a car is not the cost to run it
[09:37:19] <MootPoot> its the insurance for my age group
[09:37:30] <Fenderbassist> yeah it does get expensive
[09:37:36] <JesseDesu> hurry up and grow up
[09:37:44] <JesseDesu> git old
[09:37:47] <Fenderbassist> if you buy an older car that runs well, you can just get liability and comprehensive with full glas
[09:37:53] <Fenderbassist> not having collision saves you 
[09:38:00] <Fenderbassist> glass*
[09:38:08] <MootPoot> fortunatly I just use the family car these days - I aim to only ever work remote so
[09:38:11] <Fenderbassist> saves you $$$*
[09:38:24] <Fenderbassist> working remote is great
[09:38:28] <Fenderbassist> generally
[09:39:36] <amigojapan> Except for less excesize it is great
[09:40:27] <Fenderbassist> amigojapan: true but you can always exercise regardless 
[09:40:29] <MootPoot> beat saber solves that problem
[09:40:32] <Fenderbassist> even just alking
[09:40:35] <Fenderbassist> walking*
[09:41:24] <MootPoot> wonder what to do
[09:41:35] <amigojapan> True Fenderbassist but it requires more motivation than just going to work
[09:41:40] <MootPoot> seems like my keyboard isent going to happen until the start of next week
[09:41:55] <Fenderbassist> amigojapan: Life requires motivation to achieve goals
[09:41:55] <MootPoot> wonder what to do this weekend
[09:42:01] <MootPoot> I dont really wanna play with arch
[09:42:37] <MootPoot> okay, I've decided on my two weekend tasks
[09:42:44] <MootPoot> they both start with a P
[09:42:47] <amigojapan> MootPoot: go camping in the snow
[09:42:59] <MootPoot> I think they havent opened reservations yet
[09:43:12] <amigojapan> I see
[09:43:55] <MootPoot> maybe I should make a website
[09:44:05] <MootPoot> I've had a idea for a debate website for a long time
[09:44:14] <MootPoot> where you have to give citations and proof for every claim
[09:44:22] <MootPoot> could do that
[09:44:28] <Fenderbassist> sounds like a cool idea to me, MootPoot 
[09:46:01] <MootPoot> then you can accept or deny the proof accordingly
[09:46:17] <MootPoot> to kind of enforce some kind of structured argument
[09:47:02] <Satin> that's not how debates work
[09:47:28] <MootPoot> right - its mostly about yelling at each other
[09:47:32] <Satin> no
[09:47:33] <MootPoot> until you get tired
[09:47:36] <amigojapan> Sounds like a good idea MootPoot 
[09:48:32] <Satin> citations and evidence are part of the process depending on the topic, but a lot of it falls down to being able to have good reasoning that strikes a balance between the abstract and the logical
[09:48:55] <Satin> imo research those things furst
[09:49:06] <MootPoot> something like you would write out what you want point by point , then there would be a box to provide proof for it   -  no proof would also be recognized as okay - but then it would be maybe some kind of scoring system
[09:49:17] <Satin> yeah that's not good
[09:49:27] <Satin> some of the best arguments don't have "proofs"
[09:49:27] <MootPoot> to see if the other person accepts your proof or point or not
[09:49:49] <MootPoot> then have some kind of discussion tree where you can discuss just that one point
[09:49:59] <MootPoot> and keep it nicely tidy from the rest
[09:50:11] <Satin> idk what you want from that sort of thing
[09:50:20] <MootPoot> structure
[09:50:21] <Satin> good conversations or good debates even are rarely made up like that
[09:50:27] <Satin> yeah sounds au-
[09:50:31] * Satin coughs
[09:50:44] <MootPoot> you're telling me you prefer the reddit style of debate?
[09:50:51] <MootPoot> or the discord style?
[09:50:52] <Satin> idk what the reddit style of debate is
[09:50:56] <Satin> or the discord style
[09:51:14] <Satin> I just know what I know from talking to people and listening to people debate and reading debate transcripts and what not
[09:51:15] <MootPoot> spamming points, lack of substanciation, repetition, mixing up of things, people ignoring what you say and vice versa
[09:51:18] <MootPoot> etc
[09:51:29] <Satin> that's just a matter of quality for one
[09:51:39] <MootPoot> structure enforces quality
[09:51:43] <Satin> debates aren't logic structure fests
[09:51:56] <Satin> too much structure and you end up with garbage debates too
[09:52:02] <Satin> too little and you'd be going all over the place
[09:52:10] <Satin> i'm not sure why you think that rigid structures are a solution 
[09:52:15] <MootPoot> yes, welcome to <insert thing>
[09:52:21] <MootPoot> everything is a balencing act
[09:52:30] <Satin> they're not a solution
[09:52:48] <amigojapan> MootPoot: just try it out
[09:52:53] <Satin> bad idea
[09:53:01] <MootPoot> is having a simple requirement to write your thing out in sections with substantition / proof = overly rigid?
[09:53:08] <Satin> yes
[09:53:12] <MootPoot> I'm not mapping out the whole thing
[09:53:26] <Satin> for every small thing you're going to start requiring "proof"
[09:53:57] <MootPoot> I did say you didn't have to have proof for everything - but not having proof would be actively shown as a marker
[09:54:06] <MootPoot> "X claim lacks proof"
[09:54:08] <Satin> you did say they'd need to provide it for points?
[09:54:15] <Satin> what's up with that
[09:54:29] <Satin> my suggestion is research the topic first, and how debates work and function normally, listen to conversations on youtube even. there's a few interesting debates between say, Hitchens and what not
[09:54:30] <MootPoot> ugh
[09:54:35] <Satin> you're being too empirical about it üëÄ
[09:54:52] <MootPoot> why would youtube debates be useful for this
[09:54:53] <MootPoot> at all
[09:54:58] <Satin> for getting a feel of how people talk
[09:54:59] <MootPoot> that is spoken
[09:55:02] <MootPoot> this is text
[09:55:14] <Satin> there is a difference but the style of thinking/approach isn't too far off
[09:55:16] <Satin> i've done both
[09:55:24] <Satin> so i can confirm, they are different, but it's not radically different
[09:55:42] <mixfix41> for an example for reddit would be good is the history subreddit. i say good because of knowledgable redditors if theres not one then thats how good it gets.
[09:56:18] <Satin> instead of trying to reinvent the debate process itself, much of which is around for ages and for good reason, and there's a reason why people emphasize thing6s like persuadeness and what not
[09:56:30] <Fenderbassist> Satin: I often joke with my friends that since I've not done a certain thing in Life, I'm completely qualified to advise about it :)
[09:56:41] <Satin> work on providing a slick UI that tries to target "good quality discussions"
[09:56:48] <MootPoot> ew UI
[09:56:59] <Satin> isn't that part of the site you were proposing pooters...
[09:57:03] <Satin> Fenderbassist:  hehe
[09:57:07] <Fenderbassist> :)
[09:57:15] * MootPoot throws web 3.0 out the window
[09:57:23] * Satin throws MootPoot with it
[09:57:35] * MootPoot hangs onto Satin and brings her along
[09:57:47] <MootPoot> I really dont care for the public speaking part of debates
[09:57:47] <Satin> wow
[09:57:51] <MootPoot> In fact I hate it
[09:58:05] <MootPoot> how its a performance art sometimes instead of a actual discussion
[09:58:28] <Satin> it's not about the public speaking, I'm just suggesting you're not in touch with the merits of not being that rigid and requiring "prooof" for everything

[10:21:57] <Aurora_v_kosmose> perf can do it, but there's also a way to get flamegraph-compatible output.

[10:44:38] <MootPoot> I guess the debate sight might work as a decent showoff project
[10:44:50] <MootPoot> but its a whole week of work sounds like
[10:46:07] <Aurora_v_kosmose> C actually forces semantics on compilers that make some optimizations much harder than they are with C++ or Rust.
[10:46:39] <Satin> heh
[10:46:51] <Satin> Aurora_v_kosmose: this is going to sound weird because i don't know what i'm saying but
[10:46:57] <Satin> doesn't rust have in-built safeguard thingies
[10:47:04] <Satin> so it's slightly slower than C on other fronts
[10:47:07] <Satin> or can be because of them
[10:47:16] <Aurora_v_kosmose> It does, but the majority of those safeguards are at compile time.
[10:47:45] <Satin> what does that imply then?
[10:47:52] <Satin> as opposed to*
[10:48:19] <Satin> as opposed to them being semantically forced or whatever?
[10:48:26] <Aurora_v_kosmose> At compile-time means that the safeguards don't exist at runtime in the program. The compiler checks them and errors in your face instead of outputing a binary.
[10:48:43] <Satin> ok i see
[10:49:06] <Satin> Aurora_v_kosmose: have people written safeguard-less rust compilers yet?
[10:49:12] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Mind, I'm not an expert on Rust, not even remotely, but it tends to try & do like C++ with doing as much at compile-time as possible.

[16:28:53] <KatrinValerie> That can ruin a show
[16:28:59] <omero> gundam is mostly ... un-sexual
[16:29:00] <amigojapan> KatrinValerie: the captain of the ship is female
[16:29:42] <Bco1981> that has a big personallity?
[16:29:44] <omero> there is lots of other themes. but sex is almost unexisting
[16:30:08] <amigojapan> Bco1981: did you watch it?
[16:30:16] <Bco1981> nope
[16:30:40] <amigojapan> Ah ok. I recommend it Bco1981 
[16:30:59] <amigojapan> Bco1981: it also has an otaku character
[16:31:23] <KatrinValerie> amigojapan: I like the artstyle already and I think a more recent gundam kinda stole the plot lol
[16:31:23] <omero> samurai champloo. that is debatable. but I am still all for it
[16:31:29] <HubertFarnsworth> my first nadehsiko anime is ai yori aoshi
[16:31:34] <KatrinValerie> but it's too early to tell
[16:32:13] <amigojapan> KatrinValerie: enjoy
[16:32:19] <omero> some show of the '90s were very much ahead for their times
[16:32:41] <omero> and it shows. (pun intended)
[16:32:57] <amigojapan> omero: the 90s was the peak of anime gold
[16:33:21] <omero> they were thought for a young audience... but ... yet... not quite
[16:33:27] <HubertFarnsworth> back then the anime studios tried new things
[16:33:51] <KatrinValerie> amigojapan: maybe I am confusing the decades then, was it the 80ies anime that didn't age well?
[16:33:56] <KatrinValerie> or maybe early 2ks
[16:33:59] <omero> some of those shows, have that 'feel'... that touch... that armony
[16:34:18] <KatrinValerie> I haven't really watched much anime as of lately
[16:34:47] <omero> its ... they told stories. 
[16:34:49] <KatrinValerie> We've finished She-ra and are close to finishing adventure time
[16:34:56] <amigojapan> KatrinValerie: I have heard of people that won't watch anime from before 2000, but in my opinion they are blocking the best anime
[16:35:11] <omero> yes, that amigojapan 
[16:35:27] <omero> its because time, evolve.
[16:35:36] <`Zephyr> I suspect the anime we watched as teenagers is the anime we feel was from the best time/decade. 
[16:35:49] <omero> but such are books too.
[16:35:54] <KatrinValerie> amigojapan: well, I like sailormoon for nostalgia reasons, but today it wouldn't work as well I think. 
[16:36:10] <omero> some have even prejudice reading classic literature
[16:36:17] <KatrinValerie> We have higher standards for tragic magical girl shows now
[16:36:17] <`Zephyr> That being said, yeah, I feel like anime has definitely lost something since the late 2000s at least.
[16:36:25] <amigojapan> KatrinValerie: it was ground braking
[16:36:26] <omero> and manga... its a form of art. literature
[16:36:44] <omero> anime are often adaptions 
[16:36:50] <KatrinValerie> omero: classic literature can be quite inaccessible, but I think many classic works are worth a read.
[16:36:50] <omero> doesnt mean anything.
[16:37:09] <omero> KatrinValerie: precisely so
[16:37:26] <omero> some books were indexed in the past. you know why?
[16:37:47] <omero> by indexed I mean: on a list of 'forbidden stuff not to be read'
[16:37:50] <KatrinValerie> Which reminds me that I still got to read more of Homers Ilias
[16:38:03] <omero> oh... 
[16:38:04] <amigojapan> omero: I recently read the Republic by Plato
[16:38:11] <omero> double oh
[16:38:15] <omero> in greek?
[16:38:20] <KatrinValerie> omero: well, some books are better not rereleased without commentary
[16:38:30] <omero> why, KatrinValerie 
[16:38:48] <omero> you dont have what it takes to understand on your own?
[16:39:08] <KatrinValerie> omero: it always depends on who reads it obviously
[16:39:14] <omero> yes.
[16:39:20] <KatrinValerie> in an ideal world people who pick up a book are critical of the contents
[16:39:24] <omero> and who is the reader there
[16:39:38] <KatrinValerie> in reality books have a certain authority and many assume what is written in a book must be true
[16:39:40] <amigojapan> omero: no English
[16:39:49] <omero> lol
[16:39:49] <amigojapan> omero: English

[16:40:10] <KatrinValerie> omero: books can spread lies and hatred, which can turn into real world violence.
[16:40:20] <amigojapan> Ah nice darkwitch they fooled me
[16:40:21] <KatrinValerie> Though in todays world the internet is much better at that
[16:40:38] <KatrinValerie> But the mechanisms are different
[16:40:49] <omero> but the reader is the final supreme arbiter. else is futile.
[16:40:59] <darkwitch> yes, just as you should not believe everything you read in a book, don't believe everything you watch on youtube
[16:41:27] <omero> yes, that. darkwitch has a point.
[16:41:30] <KatrinValerie> Social media these days is scary, people who watch meme compilations on youtube will inevitably end up getting fascists in their recommendations.
[16:41:41] <amigojapan> darkwitch: don't believe almost anything*
[16:41:47] <omero> its not that. 
[16:41:55] <KatrinValerie> The way that sects and cults can recruit members these days is scary
[16:41:59] <darkwitch> believe nothing, know everything
[16:42:05] <omero> cum granus salis.
[16:42:10] <KatrinValerie> And these conspiracy theorist groups are basically just modern cults
[16:42:35] <omero> with a pinch of salt
[16:43:04] <KatrinValerie> darkwitch: I know that I know nothing
[16:43:12] <KatrinValerie> compared to the infinity of possible knowledge
[16:43:17] <omero> means,.. take everything, but consider adding your own ingredient (salt, tah dahhh... its the reason)
[16:43:29] <amigojapan> KatrinValerie: but being fooled by them is usually a lack of education
[16:43:41] <omero> its like when you are preparing dinner
[16:43:41] * KatrinValerie puts on her armchair philosophers fedora and grins
[16:44:07] <darkwitch> consider trying other salts than the boring old sodium chloride
[16:44:09] <KatrinValerie> amigojapan: No, education alone is not sufficient. It has to be education in critical thinking and media competence.
[16:44:22] <KatrinValerie> And that is completely lacking from our school curiculum
[16:44:43] <amigojapan> KatrinValerie: I never had that
[16:44:50] <omero> oh... try avoiding the potassium one, darkwitch 
[16:45:27] <darkwitch> a 50/50 blend is not so bad omero
[16:45:28] <KatrinValerie> amigojapan: Knowledge does not make you a critical thinker, very inteligent people can be oblivious to manipulation, you should know.
[16:45:30] <omero> but I will not spell that correctly. its VERY dangerous
[16:45:53] <darkwitch> nonsense, it's not very dangerous
[16:46:05] <omero> cloruro di potassio?
[16:46:09] <KatrinValerie> anything not handled properly can be dangerous
[16:46:14] <omero> yes
[16:46:15] <amigojapan> KatrinValerie: I learned by trial by fire
[16:46:30] <amigojapan> KatrinValerie: I joined a cult
[16:46:35] <KatrinValerie> Do you have any idea how many anual deaths are caused by dihydrogen-monoxide?
[16:46:48] <omero> drinking your meal could be dangerous
[16:47:30] <omero> oh... we're going little chemist, now :)
[16:47:48] <omero> irc wasnt made for that
[16:47:49] <KatrinValerie> amigojapan: Yeah was refering to that and with the internet there's an advent of new cults and sects
[16:48:16] <amigojapan> KatrinValerie: I think I can avoid them now
[16:48:19] <KatrinValerie> I consider the alt-right and conspiracy nut jobs to be mini-sects
[16:48:38] <omero> lol... we also have flatlanders :P
[16:49:06] <omero> but chemistry is more serious
[16:49:07] <KatrinValerie> Yeah, sounds funny until they start doing really stupid things because they believe in a horrible government conspiracy
[16:50:28] <omero> ok. someone please tell me how we switched from talking about sex in anime/manga to conspiracies
[16:50:28] <KatrinValerie> In Germany there's a quater of the population that now believes we do not live in a democracy anymore and who are convinced that the vaccine is a mass genocide.
[16:51:02] <omero> ahm... in italy too KatrinValerie 
[16:51:09] <KatrinValerie> it's very scary
[16:51:25] <KatrinValerie> omero: I think most european countries face this problem to an extent.
[16:51:31] <KatrinValerie> Some places worse others not so bad.
[16:51:53] <darkwitch> democracy doesn't work very well in current implementations, but it's better than having a dictator running the country
[16:51:55] <omero> I could travel...
[16:52:28] <omero> you think I could get away with the new regulations?
[16:53:04] <omero> they will fine me, when checked and not being compliant with what they call 'law'
[16:53:33] <omero> shall I bow my head? because 'they' say I must be compliant 
[16:53:49] <omero> or should I keep a low profile.
[16:53:58] <omero> and be away for a while
[16:54:01] <amigojapan> darkwitch: a benevolent dictator is not impossible
[16:54:08] <darkwitch> democracy can not work anyway if half the people want something else than the other half
[16:54:27] <omero> half?
[16:54:52] <omero> thats hardly real.
[16:55:09] <omero> unless you are precise in dosing parts.
[16:55:16] <darkwitch> the last few US elections have been like that omero
[16:55:17] <amigojapan> omero: I think she is referring to democrats Vs republicans
[16:55:17] <omero> and the universe never does that...
[16:55:42] <darkwitch> maybe they should split the place in half
[16:55:54] <KatrinValerie> amigojapan: the contrast between republicans and democrats has increased a lot
[16:56:08] <darkwitch> then everyone would be happy in the end (yeah right)
[16:56:09] <KatrinValerie> the USA as they are right now really scare me
[16:56:10] <omero> even when you cut a orange in half... its not so precise
[16:57:01] <omero> besides.... quantum mechanics
[16:58:01] <KatrinValerie> Even though the democrats have declared that they'll protect minority rights, republicans continue to push legislation to the contrary at a state level

[16:59:06] <KatrinValerie> It's horrorfying really, especially the massive moral panic against trans people, all the republican states are trying to make our existence or talking about it illegal.
[16:59:22] <amigojapan> omero: I am uneasy taking about boobs
[16:59:27] <KatrinValerie> amigojapan: I doubt it is any single persons fault.
[16:59:42] <darkwitch> it's not about being precise. if 51% wins then 49% loses, which is close enough to half to still make democracy fail
[17:00:14] <KatrinValerie> And far-right protestors even went as far as burning down planned parenthoods
[17:00:26] <KatrinValerie> happened in the past too, but seems to be a returning trend...

[17:02:55] <KatrinValerie> amigojapan: Parents with trans children literally have to flee states, so that their kids are not forced into detransition.
[17:03:12] <KatrinValerie> It has already caused a massive increase in suicides amongst trans youth.
[17:03:33] <amigojapan> KatrinValerie: I was talking about the burning down
[17:04:02] <KatrinValerie> amigojapan: oh, I was talking about all the things combined.
[17:04:13] <omero> the ethical state
[17:04:31] <KatrinValerie> The most vile thing is, that they circumvent a high court ruling, by making these laws so that citizens can enforce them.
[17:04:49] <KatrinValerie> Basically making it a bounty hunt to rat out people who allow trans children to live as their authentic self.
[17:05:10] <KatrinValerie> Doctors can be thrown in jail for using the kids prefered pronouns

[17:06:25] <KatrinValerie> amigojapan: we have very clear evidence that the medice prevents suicides

[17:08:22] <darkwitch> opinion is no good unless it's the same as every else's opinion
[17:08:41] <HubertFarnsworth> omero: we can talk about it but people these days are so critical that they can't bear to hear anything that varies from their opinions
[17:09:04] <darkwitch> having a different opinion means you will get attacked

[17:09:16] <amigojapan> I have been a kid too KatrinValerie 
[17:09:24] <KatrinValerie> amigojapan: The thing is, with halting puberty there is no harm done, from data we know that even for kids that don't go onto crossex hormones later have benefits from pausing puberty.

[17:52:49] <Urchin[emacs]> anti-trans propaganda is largely patterned after regular genocidal propaganda, and doesn't really differ much
[17:53:02] <senti> KatrinValerie, please mediate. Satin clearly just said, take your shorts off. I said maybe. How should we settle this?

[17:54:10] <senti> also, amigo is a witness to the whole thing.
[17:54:20] <Satin> Sapphirus: I mean, to be clear, I'm pretty critical of what kids are given as well and so on. But this starting premise is just flawed and so much bad logic. It's not nuanced or anything like that

[17:54:50] <KatrinValerie> You even bought into one of the most effective narratives they use to radicalise people

[17:55:06] <Sapphirus> Satin, yeah, although I don't think it's anti-trans to be in favour of consent.
[17:55:08] <KatrinValerie> amigojapan: the next step would be to convince you that we older trans folk are actually grooming kids to become trans
[17:55:09] <Satin> senti: that's not what happens in the real world is the problem
[17:55:25] <amigojapan> KatrinValerie: I came up with it
[17:55:27] <HubertFarnsworth> senti: I want to be trains
[17:55:42] <senti> Satin: well, the real world is shit, that's why I live alone and only visit the grocery store and gas stations mostly.
[17:55:45] <senti> sometimes my parents too.
[17:55:51] <Sapphirus> Given I just jumped into this conversation, Satin, I think it's pretty sane to be questioning this stuff.
[17:55:55] <Satin> Sapphirus: Not inherently, but it could be when you're buying into xyz commonly pedaled transphobic narrative :P People rarely will openly admit their position to be as such even if that's what it  often amounts to.
[17:55:56] <KatrinValerie> amigojapan: We like to think that, but in reality we did not come up with most of our thoughts
[17:56:04] <senti> HubertFarnsworth, I'm happy as I am.

[17:56:44] <senti> well, alone and drunk is even better, MU WA HA HA HA
[17:56:51] <amigojapan> KatrinValerie: I have mostly watched pro trans things
[17:56:57] <Satin> Sapphirus: I don't think it's unquestionable or above question either, what/where I sharply disagree with is those sort of starting premises or the basis I saw amigo say what he said above. Some of these go against very much established medical approaches as well with weird transphobic fearmongering etc.
[17:57:11] <Satin> But yeah I don't disagree that it's not above questioning or whatever. That's dogmatic too :P
[17:57:13] <senti> how many years have I even been here and alone anyway

[17:59:52] <amigojapan> KatrinValerie: I told you the other day tho I forgot her name now
[17:59:56] <Sapphirus> Concern of mine is that you could potentially be ruining a kid for life if they regret the decision, and that a child cannot consent to permanently life-altering medical decisions.
[18:00:00] <sentionics> I wish.
[18:00:04] <sentionics> All I got is miller lite
[18:00:10] <Satin> Sapphirus: If your basis is "but the children, I don't want to give them medicine" it's a weird narrative, and it's not one  that's too uncommon among the fearmongering right-wing anti-trans propoganda. So it's not only a weak basis, but it's also just a boringly generic anti-trans peddled one.

[18:00:18] <sentionics> actually I had an ass load of it, but I'm drinkint it out
[18:00:45] <sentionics> that was an important time when sagan needed my help
[18:00:50] <HubertFarnsworth> there's only one?
[18:00:50] <sentionics> I'm a good samaritan.
[18:00:59] <HubertFarnsworth> lol sentionics 
[18:01:19] <Satin> Sapphirus: Yeah, but that's not what happens essentially, doctors don't sign off on masses of papers agreeing to it. I think it's very important to have doctors individually evaluate the situation.
[18:01:23] <Sapphirus> Satin, I think this is an issue of bodily autonomy. Children have almost no capacity to provide proper informed consent and have no capacity to rationalise the overarching conaeuqences.
[18:02:03] <Satin> Sapphirus: When young teenagers are working with their doctors and actively are helped by it, with clearly good long lasting outcomes, it's not something to rationalize against with bodily autonomy.
[18:02:11] * sentionics attempts to quote HubertFarnsworth, but instead hands him a beer by accident!

[18:02:45] <Sapphirus> Satin, not necessarily. Brain development is a decades long process.
[18:02:50] <KatrinValerie> She is probably taller than all of you
[18:03:13] <sentionics> KatrinValerie, I'm a little guy. Don't make me feel littler than I already am.
[18:03:16] <amigojapan> KatrinValerie: you're argument could easily be flipped and said "you are just paroting trans propaganda you did not really think yourself
[18:03:23] <Sapphirus> ^^^^
[18:03:25] <Satin> Sapphirus: But what in the world does this have to do with "brain development" ? lol
[18:03:39] <KatrinValerie> amigojapan: I have read an increadible amount of research papers on the subject
[18:04:03] <Sapphirus> Satin, the decision-making part of the brain (frontal cortex) doesn't fully develop until the age of 25.
[18:04:06] <sentionics> My brain's development needs to roll back a few versions. So I drink. I'm still on the master branch.
[18:04:17] <amigojapan> KatrinValerie: well I have not read anything. My mind is pure
[18:04:19] <KatrinValerie> amigojapan: I looked for quality of research
[18:04:25] <Sapphirus> What I'm trying to say is that a young teenager doesn't know what he or she wants.
[18:04:27] <Satin> Sapphirus: That is *not* a cause for denying what is essential healthcare to young people who need it.
[18:04:37] <Sapphirus> An adult can easily manipulate a teenager.
[18:04:40] <Satin> Sapphirus: I sharply disagree. They do know what they want. 
[18:04:46] <Satin> Sapphirus: Where does the adult manipulation come into this?
[18:04:48] <KatrinValerie> And I can tell you 100% that denying teens puberty blockers kills
[18:05:02] <KatrinValerie> That is a fact, shown over and over again
[18:05:11] <amigojapan> KatrinValerie: I don't think it kills
[18:05:16] <Satin> yes it does kill
[18:05:23] <KatrinValerie> amigojapan: That is grossly offensive
[18:05:26] <Satin> amigojapan: are you not aware of the suicide rate and discrimination
[18:05:27] <Satin> the fuck
[18:05:28] <Sapphirus> Satin, I bring that up because none of this seems to be rooted in a ground-sane reality.
[18:05:29] <KatrinValerie> I have lost friends because of gatekeeping
[18:05:42] <KatrinValerie> amigojapan: nothing will bring them back
[18:05:52] <KatrinValerie> I do not want this to keep happening over and over again
[18:06:00] <amigojapan> No I meant I don't think giving them the blocker will kill them KatrinValerie 
[18:06:04] <KatrinValerie> and now things are actively getting worse
[18:06:15] <Satin> Sapphirus:  I think what is "ground-sane-reality" to you, and what is ground-sane-reality to me is very different. I'm not trying to be too offensive, but yours is casual armchair sort of "they can't make choices about healthcare themselves"
[18:06:20] <KatrinValerie> amigojapan: denying the blockers is what kills
[18:06:47] <Satin> Sapphirus: Young people already make decisions about their health, in many US states once you turn 16, your parents can't just deny that.
[18:07:00] <Sapphirus> Satin, well, we've all been teenagers. Teenagers don't think about the overarching consequences of their decisions in the long term.
[18:07:10] <Satin> Also. More importantly. Sapphirus: There's clear research that shows improved outcomes. Yes they should be conducted for longer, but from everything we know, young trans individuals are in fact happier, have reduction in suicide rates w/ gender affirming services and more lol
[18:07:15] <Sapphirus> Evidence to support that is that the frontal cortex is underdeveloped.
[18:07:29] <Sapphirus> Hence why we have laws regarding consent..
[18:07:32] <Satin> Is your whole basis going to only rely on vague hand-waving "but their brains are not developed enough" ? ....
[18:07:50] <Satin> They already make medical decisions for themselves in consultation with medical professionals for one. 
[18:07:56] <KatrinValerie> Satin: it is not only beneficial to the trans kids
[18:08:09] <Satin> For another, the *actual* data from studies conducted thus far on the matter goes against your argument.
[18:08:14] <KatrinValerie> even kids that turn out to be "gender confused" profit from blocking puberty

[18:08:20] <amigojapan> KatrinValerie: why do you react so emotional when that was just a miss understanding of what I said
[18:08:28] <Satin> so the "ground-sane-reality" here is on the side of favouring early trans healthcare, not denying it, quite clearly.
[18:08:32] <KatrinValerie> amigojapan: because friends of mine died
[18:08:37] <Sapphirus> There's also a ton of research that suggests the opposite, and is in alignment with the reality that teenagers aren't exactly capable of rationalising consequences of their actions.
[18:08:45] <Satin> Oh, where is it?
[18:08:45] <KatrinValerie> I have lost people who were dear to me, because of this gate keeping system
[18:08:49] <KatrinValerie> And they were adults
[18:08:49] <Sapphirus> Which is also supported by the fact the frontal cortex is underdeveloped.
[18:08:57] <Sapphirus> Other research I'd wager is supported by ideological presuppositions.
[18:08:58] <KatrinValerie> This is something that adults do not make it through alive
[18:09:09] <KatrinValerie> But we expose kids to even worse gatekeeping
[18:09:09] <amigojapan> KatrinValerie: in their teens?
[18:09:33] <Satin> Sapphirus: Be specific. Instead of being specific to this context and situation, you're like one of those people that cite and jump the gun and go to evolutionary-psychology explainations.
[18:09:40] <Satin> It's too casual a jump in logic.
[18:09:45] <amigojapan> KatrinValerie: why do you have so many kid friends, that's strange
[18:09:53] <KatrinValerie> amigojapan: no later on obviously, my direct experience stems from adult peers. but I know the data about teens from countless studies
[18:10:00] <KatrinValerie> Do you read?
[18:10:17] <amigojapan> KatrinValerie: you replied after I asked
[18:10:26] <amigojapan> Maybe lag
[18:10:40] <KatrinValerie> Possibly
[18:10:41] <Satin> I don't disagree that teenagers have maturing and development to do, but that is *no* sane basis at all for suggesting "therefore, we should deny them gender affirming healthcare" when studies show clearly otherwise. In general in the medical community, this finding isn't questioned or whatever lol
[18:10:58] <Satin> This basic premise that yes, trans health services to young people are *better*.
[18:11:23] <KatrinValerie> Satin: though there are trolls trying to peddle that there's desistance rates of up to 70% if you keep the kids off of blockers...
[18:11:25] <Sapphirus> Because the latter part is an ideological presupposition on your part there. 
[18:11:37] <Satin> ideological presupposition - how so? do elaborate lol
[18:11:56] <KatrinValerie> Sapphirus: it is amazing how cis people manage to turn this on its head
[18:11:57] <amigojapan> KatrinValerie: your emotions seem to show you are very bent on this and don't want to hear any opposition
[18:11:58] <Satin> I can dig up these studies if need be. This isn't my first conversation regarding this, though it's been a while.
[18:12:06] <Satin> Now, see, if you were more nuanced about it and discussed ages like surgery and what not, and so on, I could actually concede a bit here and there. That's not what you're doing here.
[18:12:19] <Sapphirus> 'gender affirming healthcare' says it all to me. That's an ideological thing.
[18:12:22] <Satin> You're the one with weird hand-wavey logic as a basis. "But their brains aren't matured enough" !
[18:12:28] <KatrinValerie> amigojapan: because the facts are already so very clear and I am literally crying that you do not care about that at all
[18:12:43] <KatrinValerie> People are dying because of this, do you not understand that?
[18:12:46] <Satin> Sapphirus: That is a commonly used medical term Sapphirus, I'm  not sure how it's ideological. Get your brain straight here.
[18:12:58] <amigojapan> No I don't KatrinValerie 
[18:13:09] <Sapphirus> You subscribe to the belief system that medical professionals shouldn't be allowed to do anything other than affirm.
[18:13:28] <Satin> No. It doesn't say that anywhere, that is a huge leap in logic on your part.
[18:13:31] <KatrinValerie> Sapphirus: Do you even know what affirmation means?
[18:13:38] <Sapphirus> I call it a belief system, because as far as I'm concerned -- that's exactly what it is. There's no rationality in gender affirmation in medicine. 
[18:13:44] <Satin> That is a very very strange logic/leap in your part.
[18:14:11] <KatrinValerie> Satin: that's a result of the massive anti trans propaganda machine
[18:14:19] <Satin> Yeah, I don't know what to tell you. It's not like the term used is stopping them from establishing hypothetically that gender affirmitive services are causing harm.
[18:14:22] <KatrinValerie> and people don't even question where they picked up these believes
[18:14:23] <Satin> What a weird basis.

[18:15:29] <KatrinValerie> My right to live is not negotiable
[18:15:29] <Satin> Such a disappointing cop out though. You dismiss the wealth of studies and findings altogether because of something so silly as the name of the term used medically in order to reference it.
[18:15:31] <Satin> Lol
[18:15:38] <amigojapan> Sapphirus: they will be called killers if they don't affirm
[18:15:45] <Satin> Because it's apparently "ideological" rofl
[18:15:51] <HubertFarnsworth> KatrinValerie: what is your point? I mean in this whole thing.
[18:15:55] <KatrinValerie> amigojapan: In reality the opposite is happening 
[18:16:07] <KatrinValerie> Gender affirming care across the USA is being shut down
[18:16:21] <Sapphirus> amgiojapan, well exactly.. and they'll be shouted down as being culpable for suicide.
[18:16:26] <amigojapan> KatrinValerie: you are calling me a killer, you will call doctors killers too
[18:16:26] <Satin> This is the sort of thing flat earthers do tbh. Twist words, cherry-pick small random shit, discredit NASA scientists with weird "look at what term they use" rather than actually seeing the data for what it is.
[18:16:30] <KatrinValerie> HubertFarnsworth: that allowing trans kids to access healthcare they need is a basic human right q.q
[18:16:45] <KatrinValerie> Why is this up for discussion? I don't understand
[18:16:57] <KatrinValerie> You are saying we should deny kids life saving medical treatment
[18:17:00] <KatrinValerie> That is what you are saying
[18:17:09] <KatrinValerie> No matter how many reasons you come up with to justify otherwise
[18:17:20] <Satin> KatrinValerie: I don't think you should be that surprised either. It's new to many people who've never thought about it before. That doesn't make them right or fix their ignorance, but you should not also be too surprised either IMO :P
[18:17:27] <KatrinValerie> You are stating, we should kill trans kids, in case there might be a cis kid mistakenly thinking they are trans.
[18:17:28] <amigojapan> 11:46 PM <KatrinValerie> Why is this up for discussion? I don't understand<---see you don't even want resending voices to speak
[18:17:29] <HubertFarnsworth> I see. I don't know at what point in childhood do kids know about their gender.
[18:17:56] <Sapphirus> And by the way, I know what the word 'affirmation' stands for. I just don't subscribe to your ideological complex on this matter.
[18:18:02] <amigojapan> Desending voices*
[18:18:30] <HubertFarnsworth> what are you saying Satin? what's your point?
[18:18:32] <KatrinValerie> HubertFarnsworth: all research currently suggests its "fixed" at birth, meaning that gender identity is likely hardwired before we are even born
[18:18:36] <Satin> Uh huh. You're dismissing data on the basis of what commonly accepted term is used in the medical community and claiming that's bias and stopping them from finding the actual truth. It's a pretty extraordinary and stretch of a claim.

[18:19:27] <amigojapan> HubertFarnsworth: that kids are not mature enough to decide they are from a different gender
[18:19:33] <Satin> HubertFarnsworth: What I'm saying is that the logic of the people opposing trans healthcare for young people is incredibly naive, armchair reasoning rather than actually closely listening to what medical professionals say and the studies that have been conducted so far on the matter.
[18:20:03] <Sapphirus> Satin, I don't think it's a stretch, given this an ideological complex, which is above any sort of critique or descent. 
[18:20:03] <Satin> HubertFarnsworth: I'm also saying I don't think the topic is above questioning, but that the reasoning/premises must be far better than stupidily simple fearmongering bait tier shit like

[18:21:32] <KatrinValerie> Oh hear it comes
[18:21:41] <HubertFarnsworth> Satin: what's the logic of people opposing trans healthcare?
[18:21:42] <KatrinValerie> Parents bullying their kids into accepting a cross sex gender role
[18:21:43] <Satin> "gender affirming approach, means that they're already biased instead of looking at if it's effective or not fairly" <--- outright conspiracy theory bullshit and very lame as a basis for opposing reading/acknowledging the data
[18:21:45] <Sapphirus> Satin, denying the reality doesn't change that reality.
[18:22:11] <JesseDesu> what are we arguing about
[18:22:13] <Satin> uh huh you're the one "denying reality" with silly terminalogical fixiation buddy
[18:22:13] <KatrinValerie> Sapphirus: you dismiss all scientific research on the matter, by saying it's ideology :?
[18:22:16] <Sapphirus> You can mock me all you want for 'applying evo-pscyh', but it's a valid approach that your ideological position can't handle rationally.
[18:22:28] <KatrinValerie> I don't think you have a very firm grasp on reality Sapphirus 
[18:22:30] <KatrinValerie> Sorry.
[18:22:53] <JesseDesu> oh no you  didnt
[18:23:25] <Satin> HubertFarnsworth: The logic of people opposing trans healthcare for young people is often along the lines of "they're too young to be making such decisions" and "they don't really know what they want" and some even think there's some sort of conspiracy to get them to transition and are suspicious if it even helps them.
[18:23:35] <Sapphirus> KatrinValerie, I'd hope you would say something like that, because you've demonstrated this by saying anyone who descends from your position as 'killers of trans people'.
[18:24:17] <Satin> Sapphirus: yeah it is indeed a very mock-able position. Randomly trying to appeal to evolutionary-psychology concepts is weak when it's up against controlled studies that address the actual thing. :P

[18:25:05] <JesseDesu> this convo is beyond me
[18:25:18] <JesseDesu> i have no strong opinion one way or another

[18:25:39] <JesseDesu> you should all try to do the same
[18:25:41] <darkwitch> let them do as they wish
[18:25:42] <Satin> Sapphirus: To add onto that, the same people who study such brain development related topics don't even necessarily disagree with trans healthcare at all for young people<-- it's you who's misusing their research to vaguely apply something from some totally different context onto some totally other topic and hoping it sticks, even when it's opposed to the data out there. not cool.
[18:26:00] <darkwitch> stop caring about if they are old enough or not
[18:26:05] <doit4madden> kids should b able to smoke and drink as well then at any age
[18:26:06] <Sapphirus> I mean, if they did disagree, they'd be cancelled and shouted at as killers.
[18:26:13] <HubertFarnsworth> so what's the age when kids would be sure of their gender identity?
[18:26:24] <Sapphirus> Cancel culture would evaporate them, so they conform even if they disagree.
[18:26:25] <Satin> Sapphirus: Well, I don't feel really motivated to try to climb that huge hill then. Your loss - all I can do is wish you well and hope you don't apply such alarmingly simple naive logic onto other things /shrug

[18:27:57] <Sadale> HubertFarnsworth, actually it's a prostate massager. But I couldn't figure out how to use it to massage my prostate yet. I guess I need to experiment more with it some days later.
[18:27:59] <KatrinValerie> Sapphirus: You apply that science wrong though
[18:28:01] <KatrinValerie> Like
[18:28:15] <KatrinValerie> You are just so obviously oblivious to how things work
[18:28:17] <Satin> HubertFarnsworth:  Which is fair. I'm not really entirely sure either what the right age range is for, say, consent when it comes to things like sugery. I would rather wait till they're 18 for that. But I know that there's clear research that shows stuff like HRT and what not are in general effective in aiding this demographic and improving their outcomes of not only happiness but also not dying from dysphoria related stuff that puts them more at risk.
[18:28:24] <JesseDesu> everyone here is a fucking armchair expert
[18:28:30] <JesseDesu> look at them go
[18:28:33] <Sadale> HubertFarnsworth, I find it funny how it comes with a vibrator inside. Yet it still doesn't stimulate my prostate. But I do find it enjoyable to have something up my ass. xD
[18:28:43] <Satin> Sapphirus: no, my "belief" or stance isn't rooted in opposing those fields - it'
[18:28:49] <Sapphirus> KatrinValerie, instead of a non-sequitur like that, do you care to explain how I'm improperly applying it? 
[18:28:52] <Sadale> HubertFarnsworth, It's my first time that I've stuck something into my ass :3
[18:28:57] <Satin> 'is rooted in opposing simple naive armchair logic like yours
[18:29:06] <Sapphirus> Because it doesn't seem like you have anything other than "wahhhh you don't knwo what you're talking about :'('
[18:29:08] <JesseDesu> why is armchair a fun word
[18:29:09] <Sadale> What are you guys talking about BTW
[18:29:10] <KatrinValerie> Also HRT is entirely reversible for a long long time, likely many years
[18:29:12] * Sadale reads scrollback
[18:29:31] <JesseDesu> sadale lets try to skew the conversation back to anime
[18:29:35] <Satin> "oh this concept in evolutionary psychology btw, it correlates to this situation and specific topic here" <-- the actual researchers studying brain development wouldn't even necessarily agree with you
[18:29:38] <KatrinValerie> Oh well why am I even trying at this point
[18:29:46] <Satin> KatrinValerie: don't get bothered too much by it
[18:29:51] <Satin> it's just an internet conversation
[18:29:51] <Sadale> oh. I've just finished watching Prison School yesterday. IT's a nice one. :3
[18:29:56] <JesseDesu> KatrinValerie, i offer non judgemental hugs.  would you like one
[18:30:03] <KatrinValerie> You have clearly stated that you subscribe to the notion that somehow research on trans matters is policed by ideologues
[18:30:05] <Satin> people will be how they want to be, all you can do is point out the flaws as much as possible
[18:30:10] <Satin> Yeah that was the weird part.
[18:30:13] <KatrinValerie> The thing is that garbage research gets called out
[18:30:23] <KatrinValerie> And you think oh valid critism is being scielenced
[18:30:23] <Satin> I sort of expected his position to be far more "sane" or credible than that
[18:30:40] <Satin> but the whole "lol that term means it's an ideology presupposition" showed how silly his basis is
[18:30:50] <Sapphirus> It does? Because I can't imagine it does with how people like yourself approach any descent. 
[18:30:50] <KatrinValerie> When its a survey done on parents who were all opposed to their kids identifying as trans
[18:30:58] <Satin> Yikes. Can't even evaluate the data because it has the word affirming in the name
[18:31:01] <Satin> !!!!!!
[18:31:08] * Sadale hugs JesseDesu :3
[18:31:16] <JesseDesu> satin, you have 2 minutes left on your pomo
[18:31:20] <Satin> All those flatearthers who claim the same thing about NASA scientists because of what terms they use rofl
[18:31:26] <Satin> JesseDesu: pomo already started technically
[18:31:29] <Sadale> Too bad. Now that JesseDesu has used up his hug. KatrinValerie couldn't take his hug anymore.
[18:31:36] <Satin> JesseDesu: I was heading to my discord group earlier once I woke up, but I got caught into this convo here :P
[18:31:46] <JesseDesu> sadale i regenerate hug offers every 20 minutes
[18:32:02] <KatrinValerie> JesseDesu is very hugable
[18:32:09] <JesseDesu> ty 
[18:32:10] <Sapphirus> Same way you're called a killer by KatrinValerie, is the same reason why 'gender affirmation' is used to curtail reproach. 
[18:32:34] <Sapphirus> It's an ideological dog whistle as far as I'm concerned.
[18:32:34] <Satin> not really, that's hilarious you'd claim shit like that
[18:32:47] <Satin> yeah, because you don't want to see the actual truth it sheds light on do you
[18:33:00] <KatrinValerie> Sapphirus: That claim is a dogwhistle for buying into the whole transagenda nonsense
[18:33:00] <Sapphirus> Is that the best you have?
[18:33:03] <Sapphirus> lol
[18:33:11] <JesseDesu> i really want to throw a wrench in the gears here
[18:33:11] <Satin> it's easier to dismiss it before it's even evaluated with alarmingly simple naive reasoning "oh it has affirmation in the name, therefore it's ideological"
[18:33:15] <Sapphirus> Anyway, thanks amigojapn for this interesting conversation. lol
[18:33:25] <KatrinValerie> Like honestly, you take your arguments from straight up genocidal nazis.
[18:33:28] <Sapphirus> keep typoing his nick ffs
[18:33:33] <KatrinValerie> But your position is obviously neutral
[18:33:36] <Satin> your basis isn't rooted in "I've reviewed this and what the arguments are, what the data shows and I have these considerations/criticisms despite that"
[18:33:40] <HubertFarnsworth> this discussion is not benefitting anyone btw
[18:33:42] <Sapphirus> KatrinValerie, see, you're proving my point there.
[18:33:52] <Sapphirus> This is rooted in ideology.
[18:34:07] <Satin> KatrinValerie: I don't like bringing in nazis into the conversation, I understand your line of reasoning, but there's no point in stretching it to discussing very broad things like that or whatever.
[18:34:19] <Satin> Stick to what they said.
[18:34:21] <JesseDesu> !g xkcd someone is wrong on the internet
[18:34:28] <ImoutoBot> JesseDesu: Duty Calls - XKCD <https://xkcd.com/386/> | Duty Calls - xkcd <https://m.xkcd.com/386/> | 386: Duty Calls - explain xkcd <https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/386:_Duty_Calls>
[18:34:53] <amigojapan> Sapphirus: also KatrinValerie is framing this as a cis vs trans discussion. When I think it could easily be shown that not all cis agree with us and some agree with them
[18:35:08] <HubertFarnsworth> satin, anyone who brings nazis into discussion has lost it
[18:35:20] <JesseDesu> did not see that coming
[18:35:30] <amigojapan> HubertFarnsworth: actually I don't like Godwin's law
[18:36:09] <HubertFarnsworth> is that so amigojapan
[18:36:19] <amigojapan> HubertFarnsworth: I think it stops people from using the Nazis as an example of evil . Which can be harmful
[18:36:24] <Sapphirus> amigojapan, further, I think the same could be said about non-cis vs cis. There's definitely trans people who would agree and disagree with both sides.
[18:36:42] * emmeka checks backscroll of ##anime, sees argument about using evo-psych to argue against HRT
[18:36:44] <Sapphirus> One thing I will maintain is that one side is very ideologically-driven.

[18:36:48] <amigojapan> Sapphirus: ah right
[18:36:51] <Satin> emmeka: that's what I pointed out XD
[18:37:12] <Satin> tired of people randomly using science from one completely different field, and thrown at vaguely at some completely different topic
[18:37:21] <Satin> It could be worse though, I suppose.
[18:37:25] <KatrinValerie> The reason I am bringing in the nazis, is that actual arguments used here, are used by nazis calling for our extermination and that just feels a little eery
[18:37:26] <Jigsy> I've heard people say you should never use that "At first they came for the..." poem because it's reserved for the victims of the holocaust.
[18:37:30] <emmeka> evo-psych as science is... debateable, anyway
[18:37:31] <darkwitch> cis and trans is used in chemistry as well :)
[18:37:52] <KatrinValerie> Sapphirus: Your entire rethoric sounds like something straight from the alt-right playbook, yet less sophisticated.
[18:38:06] <Satin> emmeka: exactly. and it's not that it's useless, but by jove even the people researching this stuff rarely ever are connecting it to more solid and real world healthcare policy arguments lol
[18:38:17] <Sapphirus> It's a laughable critque, Satin, because it proves how you cannot actually approach this argument without science denial.
[18:38:21] *** Joins: K0K1 (~K0K1@2607:fb90:770:a0fe:447a:e21b:2d9a:309f)
[18:38:21] <Satin> which requires a completely set of different methodology to study effectiveness and what not on
[18:38:21] <KatrinValerie> That is were the really real link to nazi ideology comes in
[18:38:37] <Sapphirus> You are demonstrating this by ignoring an entire field of science.
[18:38:39] <KatrinValerie> Anti-trans circles are recruiting grounds for fascists
[18:38:41] <Satin> Sapphirus:You're the one doing the science denying heh
[18:39:01] <amigojapan> Sapphirus: they accused me of paroting stuff too as if we are incapable of thinking
[18:39:14] <mixfix41> yea some parents are bad parents and some parents are good parents. that definitely affect decision making by a long shot.
[18:39:30] <Satin> Sapphirus: The scientific approach to this is not randomly citing a cutting edge field (with lots of debatable findings that aren't yet established consensus), and naively, without any actual connecting logic or studies, throwing it at some completely different topic.
[18:39:33] <darkwitch> cis-3-hexenol smells like cut grass while trans-2-hexenal is more like green leaves and fruity apples
[18:39:35] <KatrinValerie> You are incapable of thinking about a subject that does not concern  you for the most part, but you are fed propaganda about it all the time
[18:39:41] <JesseDesu> the sky is blue.  cant argue
[18:39:48] <emmeka> but in all seriousness idk how to approach this stuff really. like if I had a 14 year old kid who said they wanna go on HRT and transition, I would probably personally think "yeah, no, you're too young to sterilize yourself forever and make these choices". But I'm not sure how much of that is just ingrained cis crap.
[18:39:58] <Sapphirus> amigojapan, I'd pay close attention to those accusations, because more often than not it's projection of what they're doing onto you.
[18:40:12] <KatrinValerie> emmeka: at that age freezing sperm would work already
[18:40:13] <Satin> I keep raising this point - even the researchers whose work you might cite with brain development most likely are entirely disagreeing with the way you're using their findings and arguing against healthcare for young people lol
[18:40:15] *** Zegnet is now known as Zegnat
[18:40:26] <emmeka> KatrinValerie this is besides the point, and expensive.
[18:40:28] <amigojapan> Sapphirus: I see
[18:40:36] <Satin> and they most likely don't even remotevly have such black and white ideas about brain development and how that relates to healthcare consent as you do
[18:41:01] <KatrinValerie> emmeka: reproductive healthcare is something that should be universally accessible imho
[18:41:04] <Satin> it's you who's doing the science denying when you deny that there are positive and effectively good outcomes shown by studies thus far, on the topic of trans healthcare for young people :P
[18:41:30] <JesseDesu> !quote beaky
[18:41:30] <ImoutoBot> JesseDesu: (191 / 465) <RedPhoenix> You make me bush sir shirafuno <b‚Äãeaky> i love bushes
[18:41:34] <emmeka> KatrinValerie but it isn't. And even still, this doesn't solve the problem for those assigned female at birth.
[18:41:58] <emmeka> sure yeah you can freeze eggs and use a surrogate but that's dicey in many jurisdictions and expensive as all hell
[18:42:05] <KatrinValerie> emmeka: well, there are several options and they need to be discussed before anything permanent is done
[18:42:14] <HubertFarnsworth> emmeka: my thoughts exactly
[18:42:21] <KatrinValerie> emmeka: trans men can still get pregnant
[18:42:30] <emmeka> sure, depending what they do
[18:42:50] <KatrinValerie> The effect of T on fertility of afab people isn't as straightforward as you'd think.
[18:43:18] <amigojapan> KatrinValerie: emmeka is one of the gayer people I know too. So definitely not a cis vs trans discussion
[18:43:23] <emmeka> the question is what line we draw for children to what they're allowed to do to their bodies before they're of age to make these choices themselves. Not whether we let them identify with another gender.
[18:43:24] <Sapphirus> amigojapan, fundamentally you have to deny a lot of established science and reality through an ideological lens to be able to rationalise this stuff.
[18:43:42] <Satin> Sapphirus: wrong
[18:44:00] <Satin> the "established science" openly acknowledges trans people lol
[18:44:01] <amigojapan> Sapphirus: to be honest I have not investigated the science.
[18:44:20] <Sapphirus> amigojapan, it's about picking the most convenient science that suits their ideoloogy.
[18:44:20] <KatrinValerie> I don't recommend it
[18:44:27] <Satin> There is general consensus in the medical community that at the very least, trans healthcare for young people is *helpful* and results in positive outcomes.
[18:44:29] <KatrinValerie> It's a horrible rabbit hole
[18:44:42] <emmeka> Sapphirus Satin is correct. It's pretty well established that HRT treats dysphoria, a well established and universally recognized medical condition, and that otherwise people tend to die or self-harm without treatment.
[18:44:43] <Sapphirus> Denying the psychological, biological sciences, because they are far too inconvenient and get in the way.
[18:45:10] <Sapphirus> I see these folks the same way as climate deniers on the right.
[18:45:20] <emmeka> evo-psych is barely a science and more of an ideology or theory in its own right
[18:45:29] <emmeka> stop pretending it's a law of the universe

[18:45:49] <ImoutoBot> [image/webp] 1.6MB
[18:45:52] <Sapphirus> emmeka, I'd respond to your 'critique' but it's exactly the same nonsense Satin said.
[18:45:54] <KatrinValerie> Neuro biology points at a biological cause for GD
[18:45:56] <Satin> Obviously that doesn't necessarily mean that the same medical community necessarily is onboard or even has any sort of consensus on other things related to this topic, such as, what age should surgery be a thing, but the very bare-basic level of this is not disputed that it results in better outcomes.
[18:45:58] <HubertFarnsworth> satin, thankfully science doesn't care about peoples' opinions
[18:46:01] <Sapphirus> I want to talk to you emmeka not an ideology.
[18:46:01] <Satin> Sapphirus: "nonsense" lol
[18:46:04] <KatrinValerie> and that is a hard science
[18:46:06] <KatrinValerie> but idk
[18:46:15] <KatrinValerie> probably somehow infiltrated by the trans agenda
[18:46:21] <Satin> lmao
[18:46:26] <Sapphirus> So if you have something that isn't just the same ol' denialism, I'd be happy to have that conversation.
[18:46:30] <emmeka> you're upholding it axiomatically as if it is the scientific consensus on the way of the world and dismissing anyone who doesn't treat it the same, and it is not, and this is unscientific of you
[18:46:34] <Satin> ^
[18:46:57] <Sapphirus> KatrinValerie demonstrated this best of your side being exactly this.
[18:47:10] <JesseDesu> you guys win.  all of you.  now go home
[18:47:14] *** Joins: mokura (~mokura@cpe90-146-60-18.liwest.at)
[18:47:19] <jbwncster> What are Y‚Äôall talking about?
[18:47:24] <KatrinValerie> Sapphirus: Your position is so ridicoulus
[18:47:31] <Satin> jbwncster: trans healthcare for young people lol
[18:47:38] <Sapphirus> Demonstration of that any reproach gets you labeled as a killer of sorts, and wouldn't you agree that's very unscientific?
[18:47:50] <amigojapan> emmeka: if this is so why are we even asking the parents for permission. When they are also lay people that may not understand
[18:47:50] <KatrinValerie> No
[18:48:02] <KatrinValerie> Sapphirus: I said actively denying trans people the healthcare they need is killing.
[18:48:05] <emmeka> amigojapan this is a valid point
[18:48:10] <KatrinValerie> oh well
[18:48:20] <Sapphirus> It's not science if you aren't allowed to question it.
[18:48:21] <KatrinValerie> I don't think you are interested in a discourse at all Sapphirus 
[18:48:23] <Satin> Sapphirus: don't use KatrinValerie 's sometimes more heated reactions to dismiss this topic
[18:48:28] <Sapphirus> And if you fail to understand that, you seemingly don't know shit about science.
[18:48:32] <KatrinValerie> You have not used a single actual argument
[18:48:40] <emmeka> like I said, I'm not sure how much of my own ingrained dispositions are causing me to approach this in potentially the wrong way
[18:48:40] <KatrinValerie> Besides calling my arguments ideological
[18:49:02] <KatrinValerie> You basically did not bring up a single argument
[18:49:09] <KatrinValerie> Nothing
[18:49:14] <emmeka> KatrinValerie simmer.
[18:49:23] <Satin> amigojapan: I don't think parents should be left out of the conversation. They're a huge factor in a child's life too. It's also important that doctors *work* with young people individually, which is often what already happens nowdays.
[18:49:24] <KatrinValerie> Sapphirus: emmeka is an actual scientist though
[18:49:38] <emmeka> I'm a scientist of plants, not humans
[18:49:43] <KatrinValerie> I study math, not really a hard science yeah
[18:49:46] <Sapphirus> KatrinValerie, and actual scientists can fall for ideology, too. They are only human.
[18:49:49] <emmeka> don't uphold my knowledge on this
[18:50:13] <mixfix41> need better layman terms
[18:50:15] <mixfix41> not looking good
[18:50:30] <KatrinValerie> I would urge everyone to just drop the subject, it's been going for hours and it's clear that it is unproductive
[18:50:36] <mixfix41> i dont actually like this argument in particular overall
[18:50:39] <emmeka> it might be productive though
[18:50:40] <Satin> man this guy is willing to dismiss anything he doesn't subscribe to as unscientific and a conspiracy
[18:50:43] <Satin> when they don't agree with him
[18:50:45] <Satin> lolz
[18:50:49] <amigojapan> Satin: what is a child takes their own life cause the parents refused using your guys argumentation
[18:51:05] <HubertFarnsworth> satin, welcome to internet
[18:51:08] <emmeka> we just gotta sort out this nonsense about there being some singular scientific answer to this question
[18:51:10] <amigojapan> S/is/if/
[18:51:15] <KatrinValerie> emmeka: it has been going on for hours and we still don't know anything about their position besides being blamed of blaming for a hundred and one things.
[18:51:40] <KatrinValerie> emmeka: we can only work with the data we have obviously
[18:51:41] *** Joins: pcyo (~pcyo@user/pcyo)
[18:51:56] <Sapphirus> And the data your ideological position compels you to ignore.
[18:51:58] <Satin> amigojapan: except that doesn't generally happen. It could, I don't know what context you're saying this in, but I'd suggest looking at some of the more well cited studies 'n meta analysis thus far (though there's plenty more tbh that should be done) if you aren't convinced it's not resulting in better outcomes
[18:52:22] <amigojapan> emmeka: if there is a single scientific answer then all doctors need to oblige
[18:52:48] <emmeka> Sapphirus but you yourself are ignoring consensus in medicine. 
[18:52:59] <Sapphirus> To which there isn't, which is why there is obviously debate among doctors and scientists that are willing to put their head out there for the chopping block.
[18:53:03] <Satin> In any case, I grow weary of this. Disappointed that this is mostly a show of "i don't like this, so ill call it an ideology" or whatever instead of actually being willing to look into the matter and come up with your own critiques of what is established consensus science in the field
[18:53:06] <amigojapan> Satin: conservative parents won't take their children in studies
[18:53:08] <mixfix41> sapphirus you are on the outside looking in arent you
[18:53:16] <Sapphirus> mixfix41, yes.
[18:53:21] <mixfix41> ok.
[18:53:22] <KatrinValerie> Sapphirus: What data is it that we ignore, last chance for an actual argument.
[18:53:46] <Satin> Anyhow, I'm going to go find a pomodoro group for my morning routines. Have a good day/night all.
[18:54:45] <amigojapan> Good way to avoid the hard answer Satin 
[18:54:47] <Sapphirus> mixfix41, what's obvious to me, at least, is there's a heavy ideological component to this and anyone (including doctors and scientists) are ostracised for any reproach.
[18:55:00] <Sapphirus> I'm not willing to swim in that ideological lake with these folks.
[18:55:02] <riv> When are they gonna start making VNs with Vtuber tools
[18:55:04] <Satin> amigojapan: what "hard answer" ?
[18:55:09] <riv> instead of these flat static pictures
[18:55:58] <amigojapan> Satin: that conservative parents won't even take their children to these studies so we don't know how they will react
[18:56:05] <Satin> amigojapan: You haven't really been arguing anything of a specific stance from what I've noticed from the past 30 minutes. It's been more what-ifs and questions. I'm not sure why you're acting like there's something I'm bluntly leaving out here
[18:56:52] <Satin> amigojapan: and what do conservative parents' reactions have to do with this
[18:57:32] <amigojapan> Satin: that parents should not have a say if the kids life is at risk for real
[18:57:55] <Satin> Who exactly said that their parents don't have any say, what tf are you on about
[18:58:01] <mixfix41> need evidence then
[18:58:03] <Sapphirus> Amgiojapan and I for daring to question anything are being labeled everything from killers to science deniers. To me, those aren't substantive arguments.
[18:58:19] <Sapphirus> "You're using this field of science. NOOOOOOO"
[18:58:23] <Satin> dont' fall for the victim mentality
[18:58:36] <Sapphirus> "Only this field of science tells is what we need to know."
[18:58:49] <Satin> no, you weren't criticized for using a field of science, you were criticized for misusing a field of science without any established links, and in very poor fashion
[18:58:56] <emmeka> evo-psych isn't a "field of science" anyway, but also... <Sapphirus> To which there isn't -- yes, there is
[18:58:57] <amigojapan> Satin: it has to do that if the science is clear bringing in parents opinions will kill some kids
[18:59:23] <Satin> you don't have any, say, studies that apply brain development to demonstrate it has a clear bearing in this context, or whatever else
[18:59:26] <emmeka> there isn't a single study of using HRT to treat diagnosed gender dysphoria that hasn't found it to work
[18:59:41] <Satin> instead you're vaguely using findings from some very cutting edge and often heavily debated field
[18:59:44] * Sapphirus sighs
[18:59:52] <amigojapan> Satin: you are hand waving
[19:00:11] <Satin> and shoehorning it into a completely different topic without any adequate reasoning or studies for why so

[19:00:28] <ImoutoBot> [title] The Controversial History of Hormone Replacement Therapy
[19:00:29] <Satin> all while ignoring ACTUAL research in the field that is more directed at it
[19:00:56] <Sapphirus> There are plenty of studies you can find with a quick search.
[19:01:20] <HubertFarnsworth> I haven't read a single paper on HRT.
[19:01:24] <emmeka> lol did you read past the headline
[19:01:25] <Satin> Sapphirus: lol HRT for cis women and its history......IS DIFFERENT from HRT being used for trans youth
[19:01:26] <Satin> holy fuck
[19:01:34] <emmeka> that paper is about treating menopausal symptoms with HRT
[19:01:38] <Satin> ROFL
[19:02:21] <HubertFarnsworth> I wonder how many people who aren't in their field would read the whole paper, check the references and actually think about it.
[19:02:27] <mixfix41> fail to sum tldr too
[19:02:30] <Sapphirus> You do realise that it is relevant, right? Hormone replacement therapy is not without risks.
[19:02:38] <HubertFarnsworth> or just read the abstract and that's that
[19:02:39] <Satin> random bullshit shoehorning
[19:02:41] <Satin> hell yeah
[19:02:52] <Jigsy> hrt cOntains MiND CONtROL SeRUM To iNcReASe thE SAleS BEFORE mAJOr HoLiDAys.
[19:02:52] <Satin> emmeka pointed out there's not one study that shows *trans youth* not benefitting from HRT
[19:02:55] <Jigsy> WAKE UP PEOPLE.
[19:03:11] <Sapphirus> Putting hormones into the body can have negative impacts. 
[19:03:13] <Satin> and now just randomly say "it's relevant, this unrelated paper about menopausal symptoms because.......HRT is not without risks!" randomly
[19:03:21] <Satin> shitty armchair logic
[19:03:46] <Satin> You're not at all critical or scientific about your approach at all rofl, for all the posturing you do as a believer in what the science says
[19:03:51] <Sapphirus> Satin, the hormones themselves have an effect on the body. 
[19:03:52] <Satin> mfw
[19:03:58] <Satin> Sapphirus: oh, and water is wet
[19:04:14] <amigojapan> Hey Jigsy o/
[19:04:21] <Jigsy> o/
[19:04:29] <Sapphirus> There's even a cancer risk associated with HRT-related treatment for menopausal women.
[19:04:38] <Sapphirus> How can you say that HRT treatment for trans folks don't encumber similar risks?
[19:04:40] <Bco1981> oof... i thought windows 7 updates was removed... i guess i just needed a 417mb roll-up update inorder to be able to use the real windows update... took it 2-3 minutes and now wants to run 802mb of important updates.
[19:04:43] <Satin> Anyhow. Off I go to do my morning routine. Don't get too caught up in vague conspirtorial cherrypicking lolz
[19:04:44] <mixfix41> i think we know you arent donating to such projects 
[19:05:17] <amigojapan> emmeka: I thought we were talking about giving a drug to slow down growth to minors
[19:05:24] <HubertFarnsworth> satin, way to start the day
[19:05:24] <emmeka> Sapphirus it isn't. but you should also read the rest of it anyway, which suggests that initial adverse effects (all very minimal) led to widespread abandonment of it because the symptoms of menopause are minor anyway, and the notion that HRT treated it was discredited, but that recent review of data from that time has suggested it actually was beneficial and shouldn't have been abandoned.
[19:05:39] <emmeka> regardless, this isn't helpful
[19:05:44] <Sapphirus> > Over the years, data regarding the impact of HRT on breast safety and breast cancer mortality have been controversial. Most of the meta-analyses and observational studies performed in the 1990s reported no increase in the risk of breast cancer with estrogen use [35]. 
[19:06:04] <emmeka> we're talking about HRT in trans youth to treat dysphoria which often causes very serious harm, not menopausal women
[19:06:10] <Satin> ^^^
[19:06:15] <Satin> HubertFarnsworth: indeed
[19:06:16] <Sapphirus> Then you read further on to see
[19:06:18] <Sapphirus> > . However, some increased risks related to dose and duration of use were found with the administration of combined estrogen‚Äìprogesterone therapies [36].
[19:07:01] <KatrinValerie> Sapphirus: the whole thing states that HRT is safe when you know what you are doing lol
[19:07:07] <Sapphirus> Given puberty blockers are essentially HRT and those minors are put on it for a long-term basis..
[19:07:13] <KatrinValerie> It even says so in the conclusion
[19:07:24] <KatrinValerie> And this is about post-menopausal women still
[19:07:38] <Satin> KatrinValerie: this is the part where I suggest not bothering too much with this conversation, it's uh, deeply flawed, and not worth your sanity :)

[19:08:32] <Satin> kek
[19:08:43] <Satin> yeah but it's sufficently clear it's not worth it at this point
[19:08:56] <emmeka> "Subsequent association with progestin allowed for the widespread use of HRT, with favorable consequences on many aspects of women‚Äôs health. Unfortunately, the surge in HRT use and its consolidation was abruptly stopped by the publication of the WHI trial, which was inadequately designed, evaluated, and reported. The damage done was huge, basically leaving many symptomatic women without an effective treatment, even if th
[19:08:56] <emmeka> e epidemiological data were not strong enough to document a clear harm to women‚Äôs health. Although most of the evidence obtained was only with oral conjugated estrogen with or without medroxyprogesterone acetate, further studies and analyses have consolidated the view that HRT is highly beneficial when given to symptomatic women within 10 years since the onset of menopause or to symptomatic women that are under 60 years of age
[19:08:57] <emmeka> . However, the damage remains, and low HRT use, which is unjustified, continues to occur throughout the world. "
[19:09:01] <emmeka> longer than I thought.
[19:09:08] <emmeka> but there we are. that's the study you linked.
[19:09:14] <amigojapan> Satin: what gave you the idea it was worth it to begin with?
[19:09:43] <Sapphirus> emmeka, the dosage and duration matters.
[19:09:58] <emmeka> you getting tired, hauling those goalposts around
[19:10:38] <emmeka> look, there's medical consensus that HRT is beneficial in the treatment of dysphoria. This article isn't even about that, and despite that, it says the opposite of what you think it says
[19:10:43] <emmeka> you clearly didn't even read it
[19:11:06] <amigojapan> emmeka: I have observed KatrinValerie trying to convince even me to become a woman. Why do you think kids won't be persuaded?

[19:17:53] <Satin> lol
[19:17:53] <Sapphirus> >  We conclude that the long-term effects of off-label pharmaceutical use for modulation of hormone levels and sexual characteristics in transgender patients have not been well studied.
[19:18:06] <mixfix41> Sapphirus: 
[19:18:18] <Satin> this is *specifically* for breast tissue, what are you looking for again?
[19:18:31] *** Joins: Koobrick (~Koobrick@207.229.174.243)
[19:18:36] * emmeka reads abstract
[19:18:41] <emmeka> ok, what are you going for here
[19:18:42] <Sapphirus> >  The tendency of steroid hormones to promote the growth of certain cancers also raises questions about the safety of differing doses and drug combinations. Further clinical and laboratory study is needed to better establish safety and dosing guidelines in transgender patients. 
[19:18:48] *** Parts: noex (~null@user/noex) (segmentation fault (core dumped))
[19:18:48] <emmeka> it just says that the results are inconclusive
[19:19:28] <Satin> it also is specific  this is about breast tissue development, it has nothing to do with the question or ethics or effectiveness of HRT in trans people, much less, trans youth
[19:19:29] <Satin> lmao
[19:19:39] <amigojapan> emmeka: you claimed the results were conclusive
[19:19:48] <emmeka> amigojapan they are.
[19:19:56] <emmeka> HRT has positive outcomes in gender dysphoria.
[19:19:58] <Sapphirus> they aren't, though..
[19:20:08] <Sapphirus> That isn't the only metric and it's a debatable one.
[19:20:11] <Satin> this is not related to HRT w/ gender dysphoria and young people LOL
[19:20:11] <emmeka> this is well established, with consensus
[19:20:19] <Satin> this is about breast tissue development
[19:20:35] <emmeka> "not killing themselves or self-harming" is typically a good metric for health outcomes
[19:20:36] <Sapphirus> There's multiple different variables that you have to take into account. 
[19:20:42] <Satin> cope
[19:20:52] <Satin> Sapphirus: keep dodging I guess
[19:21:29] <Sapphirus> emmeka, said the science is conclusive and that's a flat-out misnomer.
[19:21:38] <emmeka> no, it is.
[19:21:55] <emmeka> it's established that HRT has positive health outcomes in those diagnosed with dysphoria
[19:22:06] <Satin> no, emmeka specifically said the science is conclusive for HRT resulting in better outcomes for those dealing with gender dysphoria
[19:22:13] <emmeka> namely, they tend not to kill themselves or hurt themselves
[19:22:31] <emmeka> they tend to have better life outcomes, not end up homeless etc
[19:22:48] <Satin> I have no clue how emmeka has such patience to deal with people actively strawmanning and twisting his position
[19:23:00] <Satin> I don't take kindly
[19:23:06] <Satin> in contrast
[19:23:37] <Satin> MootPoot: get dumbbells, nerd
[19:23:37] <amigojapan> emmeka: is more of a centrist
[19:23:43] <mixfix41> do you know what that word mean Sapphirus 
[19:23:58] <Satin> amigojapan: he isn't, but that's completely besides the point. listen to his *actual* argument here
[19:25:00] <emmeka> Anyway amigojapan, the study's about the long term effects of HRT on breast tissue in trans youth. This article just suggests that there's a lack of long term studies about the effect and that a promotional effect on tumors is at least plausible and should be investigated.
[19:25:38] <amigojapan> I see emmeka 
[19:25:55] <Sapphirus> Issue with the statement overall is that you paint the outcomes as being everything positive, when there are other variables to take into account. You can't just ignore everything else and say "the science is conclusive, they are less suicidal"
[19:26:13] <emmeka> ie, it's possible that if a trans person gets breast cancer, active HRT could cause the tumor (which HRT itself did not cause) to grow faster. However, no real long term data on this exists.
[19:26:18] <Sapphirus> There are real health risks associated with HRT depending on dosages, drug combinations and whatnot.
[19:26:22] <Satin> when did anyone say "everything positive" come on, you're stretching
[19:26:31] <emmeka> there's health risks associated with aspirin. what's your point.
[19:26:34] <Satin> ^
[19:27:02] <Satin> what was specifically said was this: HRT is found to be effective and resulting in positive outcomes with treating gender dysphoria
[19:27:15] <Sapphirus> It's not about what you said exactly as much as it is about how you are framing this.
[19:27:24] <Satin> oh, here's another move of the goalposts
[19:27:26] <Sapphirus> The science isn't conclusive on any of this.
[19:27:33] <Satin> except it is?
[19:27:34] <emmeka> well then mr. scientist, let's approach this like scientists shall we.
[19:27:50] <emmeka> hypothesis: HRT is found to be effective and resulting in positive outcomes with treating gender dysphoria
[19:28:02] <emmeka> result: it is
[19:28:19] <mixfix41> you just call his read comprehension a misnomer
[19:28:27] <mixfix41> thats wide angle there
[19:29:15] <mixfix41> honestly that loses me completely
[19:29:30] *** Joins: xkuru (~xkuru@user/xkuru)
[19:29:41] <emmeka> Sapphirus when I said earlier to approach this ethically and politically, I was saying that you should stop trying to assert that the medical treatment is unscientific and shift your approach to dealing with this as an ethical and political question, because that's what it is

[19:29:55] <ImoutoBot> [title] Effect of cross-sex hormones on the quality of life, depression and anxiety of transgender individuals: a quantitative systematic review
[19:30:10] <Sapphirus> > The use of cross-sex hormones was associated with improved quality of life, depression and anxiety scores, although no causation can be inferred. 
[19:30:12] <Sapphirus> That's hardly conclusive.
[19:30:21] <amigojapan> emmeka: I also hear people say that marijuana is proven by science to be better than alchohol. While I am treating something I got from traffic marijuana over 20 years ago
[19:30:40] <emmeka> must've been some good shit
[19:30:41] <amigojapan> From taking but traffic
[19:30:59] <amigojapan> Taking not traffic
[19:31:14] <KatrinValerie> amigojapan: that was just banter when you said you didn't care about your gender xD
[19:31:35] <KatrinValerie> And no, you cannot convince someone to become trans
[19:31:37] <Sapphirus> amigojapan, I've skimmed through a few studies on that and they found that marijuana use is controlled for that it doesn't have a negative impact on the brain.
[19:31:43] <KatrinValerie> You can't even convince someone to come out
[19:31:44] <Sapphirus> that when*
[19:31:45] <amigojapan> KatrinValerie: I don't care. But I also don't want to change it
[19:31:46] <emmeka> Sapphirus a systematic review finds correlation with positive outcomes across the board, but states that no conclusive causation can be inferred, and that's not good enough? man, you should read more medical literature
[19:32:25] <Sapphirus> emmeka, well, you can't say it's conclusive, can you, though?
[19:32:36] <emmeka> where shit's all like "yeah idk this drug and treatment works when we checked how many people it didn't kill, but we don't know why???? anyway FDA gave us the green light"
[19:32:42] <Sapphirus> Burden of proof isn't there to say it's conclusive.
[19:32:44] <`Zephyr> I get the feeling Sapphirus is operating under a personal definition of what it means for something to be conclusive. 
[19:32:50] <amigojapan> KatrinValerie: if I was born female then so be it
[19:34:12] <emmeka> Sapphirus yes, I can say it's conclusive.
[19:34:19] <Sapphirus> "No causation can be inferred" is a pretty strong statement to make. You can't make a causative association with the outcomes. 
[19:34:26] <emmeka> at least, conclusive enough for doctors
[19:34:26] <Satin> random individual 2019 single study that shows positive outcomes still lmao
[19:34:31] <amigojapan> KatrinValerie: if I was born female I would not change to make either
[19:34:51] <Sapphirus> WHen I look at the actual science, I find something that differs from what you've been saying here.
[19:34:54] <emmeka> Satin no this is a systematic review
[19:34:54] <Sapphirus> Nothing is conclusive.
[19:34:59] <emmeka> it is a summary of existing literature
[19:35:43] <amigojapan> I would not change to male either*
[19:36:16] <Sapphirus> What emmeka said ^ which is good, because it allows you to ascertain this sort of information without having to sort through these studies yourself.
[19:36:21] <amigojapan> KatrinValerie: but if you suggested it where I was a kid, then I may have done it
[19:36:33] <`Zephyr> No you wouldn't have.
[19:36:35] <Sapphirus> These reviews are extraordinarily helpful in that respect.
[19:36:38] <`Zephyr> Let's be honest with ourselves here.
[19:36:42] <emmeka> Sapphirus that means that the studies reviewed were not able to effectively isolate HRT as the sole factor resulting in improved outcomes, because HRT is itself associated with other things in a trans person's life (transition, coming out, access to health care, so on)
[19:36:52] <amigojapan> `Zephyr: I know myself better than you do
[19:37:07] <emmeka> ie, they can't prove that HRT alone has a causative effect
[19:37:10] <`Zephyr> I think that is inconclusive. 
[19:37:15] <`Zephyr> See? I can misuse words too.
[19:37:28] <Sapphirus> emmeka, yes, exactly. Which is what I'd argue is contrary to what you've said in here before in the past hour or so.
[19:37:56] <emmeka> however, they did determine that HRT vs the absence thereof correlates completely with positive outcomes

[19:39:17] <emmeka> I'd have to read the full article to see, but I'm guessing at least some of the literature reviewed controlled for placebo effect
[19:39:27] <emmeka> that's easy enough to do
[19:39:42] <emmeka> isolating HRT from other potential sources of positive outcomes, less so
[19:39:56] <Sapphirus> What else could it be, though, if they can make a causative association?
[19:40:11] <emmeka> transitioning itself is the obvious one
[19:40:12] <Sapphirus> Placebo seems like a logical one to me. I don't know, though.
[19:40:23] <Sapphirus> Yeah, that's plausible.
[19:40:33] <emmeka> in that all people who take HRT transition, so it's hard to separate them
[19:41:57] <Sapphirus> But isn't it possible to transition without hormones or alteration of the body?
[19:42:10] <Sapphirus> I'm only asking because I genuinely don't know.

[19:46:17] <Jigsy> Heh.
[19:46:17] <Sapphirus> emmeka, what I wager is that it's completely a psychological thing and perhaps it can be attained without radical alteration of one's body.
[19:46:18] <emmeka> Sapphirus yeah, that's the reason they can't claim causation. It's all muddled up with that. It's hard to separate out the specific benefit of the drug as opposed the the events that are involved in taking it. But regardless, it is known that when we do give trans kids HRT, they do better than without it. Lots better.
[19:48:47] <amigojapan> I would not change my gender kind of like I would not get a tattoo. And it is much more of a big step
[19:49:40] <Sapphirus> Isn't it kinda dangerous to act on an assumption since there's no causal link established?
[19:50:09] <emmeka> Sapphirus and yet, medicine works this way all the time!
[19:50:37] <jbwncster> Imagine feeling trapped in your own body before you transition
[19:51:00] <amigojapan> jbwncster: I would not care
[19:51:06] <emmeka> you'd be absolutely amazed at the amount of drugs where the causal effect of something is not understood very well. hell, I encountered it yesterday, reading the label for a medication my wife's doctor recommended to her.
[19:51:21] <amigojapan> jbwncster: I don't mind being male or female
[19:51:22] <emmeka> it's more important that we understand that it does work, and how it works, than why it works
[19:51:26] <Macer> RROR: VM 1132 qmp command 'query-backup' failed - got wrong command id '113483:281' (expected 1466217:1125)
[19:51:29] <Macer> fml lol
[19:51:32] <jbwncster> Everyone is different
[19:51:47] <emmeka> amigojapan you'd probably care
[19:52:00] <emmeka> it's always interesting to me how different everything is when I get treated as a woman
[19:52:13] <emmeka> which happens to me... a lot
[19:52:18] <jbwncster> I mean if you aren‚Äôt trans you won‚Äôt understand
[19:52:29] <emmeka> but, if that experience was permanent, I wouldn't like it
[19:52:38] <amigojapan> emmeka: you want to be a woman cause people treat you better?
[19:52:40] <Sapphirus> jbwncster, although a similar rationale for being opposed to this in kids could be applied for similar reasons.
[19:52:49] <emmeka> amigojapan what? no. people treat you worse.
[19:52:57] <Sapphirus> It's very possible that a child or young teenager regrets their decision as an adult.
[19:53:02] <amigojapan> Ah I see emmeka 
[19:53:05] <jbwncster> Sapphirus: kids often know what they want
[19:53:24] <amigojapan> emmeka: that is a societal problem then
[19:53:35] <emmeka> it's easy to recognize when someone mistakes my gender, because they're condescending and act more intimidating, and are more dismissive of me, and also expect more from me
[19:54:02] <Sapphirus> Whole reason I started with the 'psych-evol' approach is to try and hammer this home. We know enough about how well children and teenagers are at making decisions for themselves.
[19:54:28] <amigojapan> Sapphirus: even a few adults regret gender changing surgery I think. Maybe few
[19:54:35] <jbwncster> People do go to therapy before they transition
[19:54:56] <emmeka> yeah it's not like you can just walk down to the street to the pharmacy and get estrogen off the shelf
[19:55:16] <emmeka> it's this whole process and ordeal that takes a lot of time and people trying to dissuade you
[19:55:42] <Sapphirus> amigojapan, yeah. You can find them out there. Had they just did a transformation of their psychology and outward appearance, would they be far happier?
[19:56:34] <amigojapan> Sapphirus: I think many people often don't know what will make them happy
[19:56:35] <Sapphirus> I think absolute caution should be taken in permanent alterations that can't be reversed. In my **opinion**, we should have a casual link to know for sure.
[19:56:55] <jbwncster> They can be reversed
[19:57:00] <mixfix41> and where
[19:57:13] <jbwncster> Depends how far you go
[19:57:19] <emmeka> Sapphirus that's not how our medical system works, and so, why is this different?
[19:58:16] <Sapphirus> emmeka, then maybe it should be approached differently, because making permanent alterations without informed consent of the individual can lead to misery down the road.
[19:58:24] <emmeka> ie if a teenager had a rare genetic disease that could be very debilitating that a treatment was available for that had proven to be effective, but its causation was poorly understood, would anyone hesitate?
[19:58:28] <amigojapan> Sapphirus: I think a million dollars will make me happy. But I hear some hottie stories from people who win the lottery
[19:58:50] <Sapphirus> amigojapan, haha
[19:59:13] <amigojapan> Horror stories
[19:59:27] <amigojapan> Damn typos everywhere
[19:59:56] <Sapphirus> emmeka, not necessarily, but permanent life-altering modifications to a developing body, which could impact one's long-term health and well being?
[20:00:25] <Sapphirus> I think it's possible to treat these folks without going to the extreme until they are of an age wherein they can provide informed consent.
[20:00:40] <jbwncster> Sapphirus: hormone blockers
[20:00:49] <mixfix41> thats true that last line but why argue and stuff
[20:01:07] *** Quits: CyberTailor (~cyber@gateway/tor-sasl/cybertailor) (Quit: Konversation terminated!)
[20:01:12] <jbwncster> Sapphirus: have you heard of Kim Petras?
[20:01:21] <Sapphirus> jbwncster, hormone blockers can have permanent effects you cannot reverse.
[20:01:29] <Sapphirus> Same with HRT.
[20:01:31] <jbwncster> Like?
[20:01:40] <amigojapan> mixfix41: people don't tolerate someone disagreeing with them
[20:02:23] <amigojapan> mixfix41: they are calling us "murderers"for just disagreeing
[20:02:57] <`Zephyr> amigojapan: I don't think it is fair to take that line. If simply accepting other peoples opinions even if you disagree with them and find them abhorrent was a virtue, you and Sapphirus would have been demonstrating it by now by simply accepting you have detractors here. 
[20:02:58] <mixfix41> i believe you should recognize its irc. they have personal info on here..
[20:02:59] <`Zephyr> But you have not.
[20:03:03] <`Zephyr> which is your right, of course.
[20:03:08] <`Zephyr> But a pot should not call a kettle black.
[20:03:10] <mixfix41> and if you argue against that... its anonymous it doesnt look good overall
[20:03:11] <mixfix41> amigojapan: 
[20:03:25] <Sapphirus> amigojapan, to be incredibly fair, I think emmeka and I have had a productive discussion.
[20:03:30] <mixfix41> and what if that argument doesnt get better amigojapan 
[20:03:53] <amigojapan> Sapphirus: agreed
[20:04:27] <amigojapan> mixfix41: I don't think it will last more than a day. I hope not

[20:05:54] <amigojapan> `Zephyr: I am not calling them "murderers
[20:06:29] <Sapphirus> `Zephyr, to your statement there, I'll admit right here and now that I like to engage in argumentation. Being able to reach some sort of common ground somewhere -- even if we don't end up agreeing -- is far more productive.
[20:06:49] <Sapphirus> Better that than just walking away, I'd say.
[20:08:04] <mixfix41> just talk facts
[20:08:10] <mixfix41> 8-D
[20:08:19] <K0K1> 06h06
[20:08:47] <K0K1> i kill chats fast
[20:09:44] <K0K1> im gay gay homosexual gay
[20:09:48] <mixfix41> i think emmeka did make ways in the convo. esp the part where being treat as a girl is different..
[20:10:03] <K0K1> whats going on here
[20:10:10] <K0K1> is there a
[20:10:13] <K0K1> *SNIF SNIFF*
[20:10:16] <K0K1> a r g u m e n t
[20:10:33] <amigojapan> emmeka: when I was younger and thin. I also sometimes got confused for a woman
[20:10:40] <mixfix41> either or its sensitive and .. i think being brought up with a blue collar dad i can be sway and manipulate from the outside looking in and thats why you gotta do it not anonymously
[20:11:02] <K0K1> wtf is this argument about
[20:11:07] <Sapphirus> I don't think anyone has ever confused me for a woman, amigojapn.
[20:11:37] <amigojapan> Sapphirus: it was flattering, they said I was beautiful lol
[20:11:57] <K0K1> i dont get confused as genders i have an androgynous look so yeh
[20:12:20] <dfch> So I booted in windows, blank staring in my game library. What am I even doing here?
[20:12:23] <dfch> Ugh, reboot
[20:12:44] <Sapphirus> People mistaken me for being a teenager due to how thin and young I look, rather than a female. 
[20:13:49] <K0K1> im nonbinary :))
[20:14:22] <K0K1> imma kinda be inactive now, im drawing sou/shin from YTTD
[20:14:28] <dfch> Yeah, that feels better now.
[20:14:30] <amigojapan> K0K1: your bits are binary
[20:14:30] <Sapphirus> Perhaps I'm not reading into this the right way or people are sending me confused signals.
[20:14:52] <Sapphirus> But If I did wear long hair, shoulder-length or longer, someone could confuse me as female from behind.
[20:14:56] <K0K1> amigojapan : yeah but im still nonbinary though
[20:15:07] <amigojapan> K0K1: hehehe
[20:15:34] <K0K1> amigojapan : amogus

[23:00:58] <K0K1> pp
[23:01:05] <JesseDesu> are you guys done arguing from this morning
[23:01:12] <JesseDesu> Satin, 
[23:01:18] <K0K1> idk if theyre arguing
[23:01:22] <JesseDesu> you guys were AT IT
[23:01:30] <darkwitch> they were
[23:01:30] <Satin> JesseDesu: yeah we're done from hours ago
[23:01:35] <Satin> I wasn't that heated or involved tbh
[23:01:38] <JesseDesu> who won
[23:01:40] <K0K1> but they stopped an hour ago and somebody responded from an hour ago
[23:01:50] <Satin> I just went afk so idk, i had to do morning routine stuff
[23:01:53] <ButterNoodle> whats the argument
[23:01:55] <Satin> like skincare routine and walking
[23:02:01] <Satin> ButterNoodle: it was about trans healthcare w/ young people
[23:02:02] <JesseDesu> they were talking about trans stuff
[23:02:08] <ButterNoodle> ?
[23:02:19] <JesseDesu> KatrinValerie
[23:02:25] <ButterNoodle> still dont know the argument
[23:02:26] <Satin> ButterNoodle: it ended up showing how amigo and saph in here have nonsense assumptions about it or whaever
[23:02:28] <JesseDesu> and Sapphiru s
[23:02:39] <ButterNoodle> oh
[23:02:58] <ButterNoodle> I mean
[23:03:08] <MootPoot> Satin: anime
[23:03:09] <ButterNoodle> healthcare should be a fixed cost
[23:03:14] <Satin> it originally started with amigo opposing katrin and saying that "kids shouldn't be given medicines" lol, which is simple enough, but he has weird reasons
[23:03:36] <ButterNoodle> companies should not be making trillions off of peoples basic needs/rights
[23:03:50] <Satin> ButterNoodle: this was more about the trans shit
[23:03:54] <Satin> than it was about healthcare
[23:04:04] <JesseDesu> militant views
[23:04:08] <MootPoot> I had roids as a kid
[23:04:08] <Satin> and then saph later interjects and tries to claim science on his side except the science clearly shows that HRT w/ young people in a controlled setting results in good outcomes
[23:04:08] <K0K1> i bet amgio is a antivaxxer
[23:04:10] <Satin> kept dodging
[23:04:14] <MootPoot> Except they called it candy
[23:04:22] <Satin> repeatedly and claiming it was ideology because of the word "affirmition" in "gender affirmition"
[23:04:27] <ButterNoodle> if I read between the lines.. he was against hrt and such for kids?
[23:04:27] <Satin> so stupid lol
[23:04:36] <Satin> ButterNoodle: yeah, on the surface that's it
[23:04:41] <dfch> so basically emmeka won
[23:04:43] <dfch> :D
[23:04:45] <Satin> basically yeah
[23:04:53] <Satin> but i /quit so i didn't see what happened later
[23:04:55] <ButterNoodle> yea.. its a clinical diagnosis..
[23:04:59] <MootPoot> Satin: none of this dodging would have been possible if they were forced into responding point by point.... 
[23:05:02] <MootPoot> Hehe
[23:05:04] <darkwitch> it was a complete failure for everyone involved in the argument, but they still kept on going for hours
[23:05:05] <Satin> nope
[23:05:05] <K0K1> wtf "OmG TraNs KidS BAd HrT BaD" thats all i read
[23:05:05] <ButterNoodle> and mental heal is part of healthcare
[23:05:08] <Satin> we went point by point
[23:05:13] <Satin> and the dodging still happened
[23:05:27] <Jigsy> That should be an Olympic sport.
[23:05:29] <Satin> now to be very clear
[23:05:32] <ButterNoodle> people should be able to feel good walking around in their own bodies..
[23:05:33] <MootPoot> Sounds like you need more structure 
[23:05:40] <ButterNoodle> *basic human right imho
[23:05:41] <dfch> Jigsy point dodging? 
[23:05:47] <Satin> I do not like putting such things above questioning - I don't think that the trans healthcare for young people debate is something that is above questioning or whatever.
[23:05:49] <emmeka> Satin you were going about it wrong, though.
[23:05:52] <Satin> But please for the love of god
[23:05:52] <Jigsy> Dodgeball.
[23:05:54] <lastonestanding> dirty harry?
[23:05:57] <Satin> ensure that your starting premises makes sense
[23:05:57] <K0K1> as somebody who is technically under the trans category this angers me
[23:06:01] <Satin> emmeka: in what regard
[23:06:02] <MootPoot> ButterNoodle: you like to walk around while flapping? 
[23:06:14] <Satin> emmeka: I can't recall if you were even there all along or joined later
[23:06:19] <MootPoot> In the breeze 
[23:06:22] <ButterNoodle> lastonestanding: dirty harry - got one of those at the old steam and cream years go
[23:06:24] * emmeka shrugs
[23:06:33] <ButterNoodle> MootPoot: flapping/fapping yes
[23:07:12] <lastonestanding> ButterNoodle: isn't dirty harry an actor?
[23:07:16] <Satin> I'm just personally astonished at how much CERTAIN individuals were interested in dodging all over the place, usually I take these people/that person to be flexible and reasonable and at least recognize the limits of their position or whatever
[23:07:20] <lastonestanding> "go ahead... make my day"
[23:07:27] <lastonestanding> you know that quote?
[23:07:28] <Satin> maybe i just don't talk here enough
[23:07:47] <JesseDesu> clit eastwood
[23:07:54] <Satin> candle
[23:08:04] <ButterNoodle> Satin: I think old people like amigo and myself have a hard time with the "kids" joining the trans community as a trendy thing.. amigo more so stereotyping the entire group
[23:08:13] <lastonestanding> yes
[23:08:15] <lastonestanding> the legend
[23:08:23] <K0K1> Rhinestone Eyea
[23:08:25] <K0K1> Eyes*
[23:08:27] <ButterNoodle> yea dirty harry is the character.. clit eastwood is the actor
[23:08:39] <Satin> ButterNoodle: i understand where that can come from yah, and obviously I'm not interested in having bad unethical things happen
[23:08:40] <K0K1> Clint u mean**??
[23:08:40] <lastonestanding> he drinks black coffee, but kills black men
[23:08:42] <Satin> or people to be manipulated
[23:08:43] <lastonestanding> maybe a racist?
[23:08:59] <Satin> I just want you know, sensible actual proper starting premisises for critiques like that
[23:09:02] <JesseDesu> K0K1, do you draw
[23:09:06] <Satin> not outright idk, fearmongering shit like some of these guys were doing
[23:09:15] <JesseDesu> you changed you nick to -drawing
[23:09:38] <Satin> based on nothing but their own assumptions and "brain development evo-psychology showing teens aren't fit enough for consent yet"
[23:09:45] <emmeka> Satin the issue at hand was that there was a claim being made that this was a dispute within medical science, the point to be made was that this is an ethical/political question and not one of medecine, because medical science does indeed recognize with consensus that HRT treats dysphoria.
[23:09:48] * Satin has ghee on her desk
[23:09:50] <K0K1> JesseDesu, yeah i draw
[23:09:55] <JesseDesu> nice
[23:09:58] <JesseDesu> can i see
[23:10:04] <ButterNoodle> Satin I support empirical evidence supporting diagnosis/treatment, and it angers me when someone just wakes up one day to join the community because its trendy - or the new fad "having something to fight for"
[23:10:07] <K0K1> ;-;
[23:10:08] * MootPoot takes Satin ghee
[23:10:09] <emmeka> Satin and rather than engage that, you just wanted to attack their position
[23:10:10] <Satin> ButterNoodle: i get that
[23:10:29] <K0K1> idk how u could see the drawing
[23:10:38] <Satin> emmeka: yes, I did want to attack their position because that's how they framed it
[23:10:39] <JesseDesu> i am the resident artist here
[23:10:46] <K0K1> they are on paper and my camera is sharpied and glitter glued
[23:10:53] <K0K1> dont ask why
[23:10:57] <MootPoot> ButterNoodle: the girls who break up with a black dude then remove BLM from their profile... Kek
[23:10:59] <JesseDesu> K0K1, do you have deviantart
[23:11:02] <dfch> K0K1 why?
[23:11:06] <Satin> I usually do try to work with people's views, but not when they themselves are in disarray about it. I'm not as lenient as you on this.
[23:11:07] <MootPoot> JesseDesu: resident evil 
[23:11:08] <ButterNoodle> that being said.. if either of my kids presented them self as misgendered - gay - or otherwise.. they would have my support
[23:11:08] <JesseDesu> you can upload free on imgur
[23:11:16] <ButterNoodle> MootPoot: dont start me on the liquor
[23:11:22] <JesseDesu> MootPoot, never played resident evil
[23:11:34] <K0K1> JesseDesu , i dont use deviant art and i have only a crappy chromebook
[23:11:35] <emmeka> Satin well, this itself is self-reinforcing
[23:11:46] <Satin> That's the way *they framed it* and it's their responsibility to be open-minded and in good faith if I were to engage it in that manner, which I more than happily would and have in the past with others.
[23:11:53] * ButterNoodle is still unsure about his neet daughter
[23:11:54] <JesseDesu> deviantart or pixiv
[23:11:58] <JesseDesu> is it anime drawings
[23:11:59] <MootPoot> emmeka: with enough baguettes and guillotines we can solve every problem 
[23:12:08] <JesseDesu> git a cheapo phone camera
[23:12:11] <emmeka> if you want to make the claim that you've got science on your side, you need to do the discourse part of the sciencing
[23:12:14] <K0K1> yeah i do anime drawings
[23:12:21] <JesseDesu> nice
[23:12:26] * MootPoot googles keto baguette 
[23:12:28] <JesseDesu> emmeka we got another one
[23:12:35] <Satin> he was pretty aggressive with his position and having science on his sides, and I didn't see any room for me to be this sort of neutral person working with those views
[23:12:43] <emmeka> JesseDesu ooooh
[23:12:47] <K0K1> mainly danganronpa or soul eater
[23:12:49] <Satin> though at the same time i dont' like how katrin and others can become morally condescending sometimes, understandably :P
[23:12:53] <Satin> that's not helpful either
[23:12:53] <K0K1> drawings
[23:13:03] <emmeka> Satin well, I did it, and it worked out ok
[23:13:06] <JesseDesu> my stuff is all over
[23:13:10] <Satin> emmeka: yeah i couldn't
[23:13:15] <dfch> nice, ecchi drawings
[23:13:20] <Satin> i'm glad you found some ground there though, gj

[23:13:46] <ButterNoodle> ig those are my deeply held opinions.. I dont make assumptions on other peoples actual "qualification" as such - thats not my place as a human being.

[23:14:22] <ButterNoodle> K0K1: no hentai?
[23:14:25] <JesseDesu> nice, did she/he confiscate it
[23:14:31] <Satin> all of this is frustrating because I do want to hear critical-of-existing position , fleshing out of such topics
[23:14:42] <K0K1> JesseDesu no thank god
[23:14:43] <JesseDesu> fleshlight
[23:14:46] <Satin> but from a sensible starting point sheesh
[23:14:58] <JesseDesu> satin likes flesh
[23:14:58] <K0K1> kirby fleshlight (jk)
[23:15:28] <JesseDesu> flash your flesh, flush your load
[23:15:35] <K0K1> well if kirby fleshlight existed it would just be a guillotine
[23:15:41] <Satin> i feel hungwyywywywy
[23:15:45] <Satin> ill try to make kheema
[23:16:03] <ButterNoodle> I prefer not to argue it at all unless its a conversation with or about a family member.. otherwise my opinions on lifestyle - healthcare are none my business
[23:16:08] <JesseDesu> yea kinda hard to masterbait with a guillotine after one stroke
[23:16:19] <ButterNoodle> bait the hook JesseDesu
[23:16:32] <JesseDesu> ButterNoodle, i bought fly tie wire
[23:16:36] <JesseDesu> lead wire
[23:16:36] <ButterNoodle> nice
[23:16:45] <ButterNoodle> u gonna tie up some flys for some kinky bdsm?
[23:16:49] <Satin> ButterNoodle: I mean yeah, i appreciate when people try to understand either ways rather than just being dismissive or w/e
[23:16:49] <MootPoot> idk about any of this gender/sex stuff
[23:16:51] <JesseDesu> its good for modeling hydralic lines on a model plane
[23:16:52] <MootPoot> I just fuck
[23:16:56] <MootPoot> :3
[23:17:01] <JesseDesu> :4
[23:17:15] <ButterNoodle> Satin: having kids make things strange
[23:17:16] <MootPoot> and stay in my lane with other activist topics that I give more of a shit about
[23:17:20] <MootPoot> like right to repair
[23:17:26] <Satin> it's better than those who don't get it entirely but at the same time maintain this weird opposition to what is different from them
[23:17:30] <JesseDesu> i like repairing shit with epoxy
[23:17:39] <Jigsy> I sometimes like driving into the opposite lane just to fuck with other people.
[23:17:42] <JesseDesu> shit fixes EVERYTHING
[23:17:43] <Satin> ButterNoodle: i c what you mean
[23:17:47] <Satin> Jigsy: do you even drive
[23:17:53] <Jigsy> I do...
[23:17:54] <Jigsy> ...not.
[23:18:00] <Satin> :stare:
[23:18:06] <ButterNoodle> my wife being different from me would probably have wanted to "beat the queer" out of my son if he was gay.. wouldnt have bothered me tbh
[23:18:09] <ButterNoodle> but
[23:18:17] <MootPoot> emmeka: I started watching lain
[23:18:26] <MootPoot> emmeka: when do I get my weebpoints in the mail
[23:18:30] <JesseDesu> beat the meat
[23:18:31] <Jigsy> Beat or beat off?
[23:18:36] <K0K1> shit fixes everything? *replaces all my glue with shit*
[23:18:47] <ButterNoodle> he was confirmed straight - or not completely gay - based on the porn he looked up, and the girls he tried to sneak in his room at night :|

[23:19:48] <K0K1> fucc
[23:19:58] <ButterNoodle> I do feel that the overuse of trans is pretty much the same as claiming to be bi in my youth.. we didnt use trans as a grop or category
[23:20:03] <ButterNoodle> nice
[23:20:08] <K0K1> how do you make a qoute
[23:20:13] <JesseDesu> grope

[23:20:22] <Jigsy> The grope of wrath.
[23:20:24] <Satin> K0K1: I don't trust your quote adding capaibilities right now...

[23:26:00] <Jigsy> Inugami Korone is... THE DOGFATHER.
[23:26:06] <Satin> it's why i stopped watching anime too
[23:26:11] <Satin> or am very very fucking picky
[23:26:11] <emmeka> Satin tropes are good for the soul
[23:26:13] <Satin> no
[23:26:29] <Satin> i'm so lucky my friend that's making me watch stuff has taste or whatever
[23:26:32] <MootPoot> CGDCT tropes anyday
[23:26:40] <Satin> rarely is it like outright bad or whatever insufferable for me

[23:27:41] <emmeka> and NOBODY EXCEPT BEAKY watched it

[23:27:50] <Satin> or heard of it
[23:27:54] <Satin> why does no one talk about it O.0
[23:27:58] <emmeka> like how the fuck did I convince beaky out of everyone to watch a BL anime
[23:28:02] <ButterNoodle> aight bois indiana is constitutional carry - print out ur constitutions and holster them in plain sight for everyone to see
[23:28:05] <emmeka> Satin because it's BL
[23:28:08] <Satin> i hang around relatively weeb communities on discord who talk about anime a lot but they don't talk enough about this sort of thing i guess
[23:28:12] <emmeka> it's a masterpiece. but it's BL.
[23:28:14] <Satin> i see.....
[23:28:21] <Satin> ill add that to my list ty
[23:28:23] <emmeka> so none of the weeb dudes watched it

[23:29:19] <Jigsy> Who doesn't?
[23:29:21] <emmeka> tbf, Given (at least the original series) isn't very steamy
[23:29:23] <Satin> Jigsy: stop
[23:29:28] <Jigsy> No.
[23:29:30] <lastonestanding> MootPoot: is that a fact?
[23:29:30] <ButterNoodle> *18+ only
[23:29:31] <emmeka> it's just a drama/music anime with gay characters
[23:29:37] <Satin> emmeka: that's that anime movie that starts with D
[23:29:44] <Satin> and has two musical guys
[23:29:47] <ButterNoodle> like it says on the cover page
[23:29:48] <emmeka> if that's intolerable to you, you're missing out
[23:29:48] <Satin> D something

[23:30:17] <emmeka> but that's a good one
[23:30:17] <Satin> that's good!
[23:30:22] <Satin> i watched that some years ago
[23:30:24] <emmeka> it's more steamy than Given is
[23:30:27] <Satin> lmao
[23:30:37] <ButterNoodle> all of the girls depicted in this anime are over the age of 18*
[23:30:38] <MootPoot> TIL Satin is a fujoshi
[23:30:38] <Satin> it's not about steamy particularly that gets me, it's how boring and mindless stuff are
[23:30:41] <Satin> MootPoot: no?
[23:30:42] *** Quits: darkwitch (~darkwitch@user/darkwitch) (Quit: Leaving)
[23:30:47] <Satin> i watch anything that sounds good
[23:31:00] <MootPoot> no wonder why she spends time here
[23:31:06] <Jigsy> And yet you still haven't watched Breaking Bad.
[23:31:07] <emmeka> Satin have I ever tried to convince you to read the LNs of Adachi and Shimamura
[23:31:09] <Satin> i've come to accept people think that my sensabilities are somewhat pretentious but i genuinenly can't stand marvel movies or whatever
[23:31:12] <emmeka> that's peak yuri
[23:31:12] <Satin> Jigsy: yes because i'm slow as well
[23:31:16] <MootPoot> she's waiting for a MootPoot x beaky paring
[23:31:30] <Satin> emmeka: lol, i haven't read LNs in years but heh
[23:31:30] <Jigsy> Capeshit sucks.
[23:31:34] <lastonestanding> I never understood how people here claim not to be pedos, yet they watch hardcore loli rape hentai videos
[23:31:34] <Satin> Jigsy: ikr
[23:31:44] <Satin> lastonestanding: don't open that can of worms rn
[23:31:45] <emmeka> Satin imagine a yuri series consisting almost entirely of internal monologues about two autistic girls
[23:31:53] <MootPoot> jiggles is here
[23:31:54] <MootPoot> lmao
[23:31:55] <Satin> lastonestanding: already had one argument today
[23:31:56] <Satin> not another
[23:32:01] <MootPoot> lastonestanding: you really wanna go down that road
[23:32:03] <Satin> emmeka: woah
[23:32:22] <Satin> i watched ant man movie or whateve with my step sister and her kids once
[23:32:24] <ButterNoodle> lastonestanding: yea some people just want to keep bringing that up.. because some people cant tell the difference between reality and fiction
[23:32:25] <Satin> brother in law too
[23:32:26] <lastonestanding> it's the weak spot
[23:32:28] <Satin> and i couldn't STAND that shit
[23:32:32] <emmeka> Adachi is probably the most relateable gay girl in anime ever. She's a fucking wreck.
[23:32:36] <Satin> makse me squirm and cringe
[23:32:44] <Satin> emmeka: sounds interesting!
[23:32:48] <ButterNoodle> its good
[23:33:01] <MootPoot> woah
[23:33:09] <emmeka> ButterNoodle the LNs > the anime, though. Not that the anime did bad. It's just a very hard thing to adapt
[23:33:10] <MootPoot> lains animation is actually decent for boomer shit
[23:33:12] <ButterNoodle> I wonder if they will adapt anymore
[23:33:21] <emmeka> because it's ALL internal reflection
[23:33:25] <lastonestanding> ButterNoodle: then I wonder if computer generated child porn would be okay
[23:33:28] <ButterNoodle> its on my list

[23:33:45] <lastonestanding> woah
[23:33:53] <ButterNoodle> lastonestanding: does it look like real children? if so - thats against the law and not ok
[23:33:55] <Satin> emmeka: that sounds interesting and original üëÄ
[23:34:08] <Jigsy> [20:03:25] <lastonestanding> ButterNoodle: then I wonder if computer generated child porn would be okay
[23:34:12] <lastonestanding> ButterNoodle: it would be fiction though
[23:34:13] <Satin> also btw remember how i was complaining about diversity for the sake of diversity or whatever
[23:34:18] <Jigsy> I believe Germany passed some law recently which allows police to make that.
[23:34:20] <Satin> i was thinking about it and Dope (2015)
[23:34:26] <Satin> is one of those things that isn't like that to me at all
[23:34:42] <Satin> it's both original, for its own thing, and at the same time is addressing stuff like coming of age, but with the modern hood or whatever
[23:34:48] <lastonestanding> Jigsy: and why does the police need that?
[23:34:55] <Satin> https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3850214/
[23:34:56] <Jigsy> Probably stings or something.
[23:34:56] <ImoutoBot> [title] Dope (2015) - IMDb
[23:35:00] <ButterNoodle> lastonestanding: doesnt matter. court ruling clearly defined that even those photos of "over 18" models doctored to look like underage girls are illegal in the US
[23:35:12] <ButterNoodle> kinda like -lookalike drug- laws
[23:35:24] <Jigsy> Lots of Japanese pornstars are literally illegal in Australia.
[23:35:33] <Jigsy> THE MORE YOU KNOW.
[23:35:34] <ButterNoodle> a cartoon represents no real human being
[23:35:52] <emmeka> Satin or really, just read the manga of Bloom into You. It's at least original.
[23:35:53] <lastonestanding> depends
[23:36:03] <emmeka> it's motw, again, for the second week in a row

[23:37:24] <ButterNoodle> !c margalize
[23:37:25] <ImoutoBot> ButterNoodle: Social exclusion or social marginalisation is the social disadvantage and relegation to the fringe of society. It is a term that has been used widely in Europe and was first used in France in the late 20th century. It is used across disciplines including education, sociology, psychology, politics and economics.
[23:37:47] <ButterNoodle> sounds like somthing I'd put on toast
[23:37:56] <Jigsy> I've already reached a point of "You know what, fuck you." when people come to me whining that the stuff they like is being censored.
[23:38:19] <ButterNoodle> Jigsy: I hope they censor them self off of a cliff
[23:38:23] <ButterNoodle> :)
[23:38:33] * ButterNoodle always hopes and prays
[23:39:12] <Jigsy> It's funny when they try to salvage themselves with "But what if they come after the stuff you like..."
[23:39:17] <Jigsy> You've already come after the stuff I like. Fuck off.
[23:39:20] <Satin> lastonestanding: I half agree, but it's not also a priority topic at all for me
[23:39:41] <Satin> lastonestanding: it's like there's also a difference b/w "encouraging it" and "being into it" or whatever
[23:39:48] <ButterNoodle> remember we are collectively stupider than we are thinking about things on our own
[23:39:53] <Satin> idk if everyone i knew had a rape fetish or whatever or if it was that widespread
[23:39:54] <Jigsy> Drawings encourage people to become furries.
[23:39:57] <MootPoot> ButterNoodle: +1

[23:40:32] <paine> o.o

[23:40:35] <lastonestanding> kinda true
[23:40:39] <paine> so true
[23:40:40] <Satin> r u sure
[23:40:48] <MootPoot> humans are animals
[23:40:49] <ButterNoodle> Satin: yea there is a difference between enjoying a new issue of "Comic Lo" by urself, and a cathoic priest sitting you down and showing you all the positions in the new issue of "Comic Lo"

[23:44:05] <Jigsy> This is what confuses me.
[23:44:12] <Jigsy> "Animals can't consent to sex."
[23:44:15] <ButterNoodle> lastonestanding: open it.. I have a horse cock folder
[23:44:19] <Jigsy> They can't consent to being slaughtered and eaten either.
[23:44:28] <Satin> there's a difference between ending their life, hopefully painlessly
[23:44:34] <Satin> and abusing them sexually
[23:44:40] <lastonestanding> a dog can bark
[23:44:41] <MootPoot> Jigsy: because this entire argument is based on the "icky" factor from our POV
