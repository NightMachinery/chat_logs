[00:37:31] <marler8997_> andrewrk curious what your thoughts are on how to improve the situation from #9989
[00:38:12] <marler8997_> and to clarity, that change would never remove the message that you showed as an example
[00:38:23] <marler8997_> since it was exit code 255, if that was the exit code then it would still be printed
[00:38:25] <andrewrk> sounds like I misunderstood the change
[00:38:58] <andrewrk> but I'm saying even if the custom error message is printed, it should still print "the following command failed ..." with the command that emitted the error message
[00:39:25] <marler8997_> but you don't do that when "prominent compiler errors" is enabled right?
[00:39:56] <marler8997_> so there are some cases where it's better not to pile on that information yes?
[00:39:59] <andrewrk> prominent compile errors is opt-in so you're specifically saying that you're ok with seeing only the compile errors
[00:40:33] <marler8997_> sure, I was just trying to clarify there are *some* cases, so the question then becomes what are those cases
[00:41:04] <marler8997_> this feature allows the builds themselves to give input on what may or may not be important
[00:41:46] <marler8997_> this means that if a build script feels it has found the source of the problem and has already reported it, then it can return a specific exit code to indicate it has done that
[00:42:05] <marler8997_> for example, if the user provided an invalid build option, no need to pile on extra errors after that
[00:43:00] <andrewrk> I disagree - in such case you *especially* want to see the command that caused the issue
[00:43:16] <marler8997_> disagree with what part?
[00:43:39] <andrewrk> in your patch you give the example of a bad option passed on the command line. if "got a bad build option!" is printed, then the user needs to see the command that was supplied to cause that error to be emitted
[00:43:42] <marler8997_> I was just stating what the feature was, what do you disagree with, my description?
[00:43:57] <andrewrk> I disagree with "no need to pile on extra errors after that"
[00:44:17] <marler8997_> oh gotcha
[00:44:27] <marler8997_> but we don't print the command that failed
[00:44:36] <marler8997_> we just say the build exited with a code
[00:45:01] <andrewrk> um no that's incorrect, we print "the following command exited with xyz:\n<full command line of what failed>"
[00:45:26] <marler8997_> ah that's true
[00:45:40] <marler8997_> one thought I had was that if the user didn't know what command failed, they could run it again with a -v
[00:45:54] <marler8997_> but that has cons to it as well
[00:46:07] <andrewrk> I don't think you should have to rummage around to find out how to learn what went wrong
[00:46:17] <marler8997_> I completely agree
[00:46:25] <marler8997_> but it's more of an art than a science here
[00:46:49] <marler8997_> for example, we could choose to print all the environment variables as well, but that adds alot of noise for questionable benefit
[00:47:16] <andrewrk> my position is that, at the very least, a full trace of command lines of sub-processes should be printed on failure, with the exception of opt-in flags such as --prominent-compile-errors
[00:47:19] <ifreund> I’m also strongly in favor of always printing the full command that failed by default
[00:47:26] <marler8997_> I think a feature that allow the build to give input on what may or may not be important can be helpfule
[00:47:57] <andrewrk> I'm going to revert this. let's discuss in a proposal
[00:48:04] <marler8997_> so why print at the command-level instead of the function level?
[00:48:24] <andrewrk> well we do print at function level for debug builds of the compiler
[00:48:34] <andrewrk> and in cases of compiler bugs it's extremely useful
[00:49:24] <andrewrk> if the goal is just to make the compile error experience better, I think the real end-game is editor integration with zig build
[00:49:34] <andrewrk> ideally what you want is a list of errors in your editor that jump you to the location
[00:49:40] <andrewrk> and squiggly lines
[00:50:06] <marler8997_> so in that case you could print alot of information and rely on some sort of filtering, so in that case you would support printing all environment variable for example?
[00:50:31] <andrewrk> printing all environment variables is a potential security issue
[00:50:38] <andrewrk> I don't think that is wise
[00:51:26] <marler8997_> ok but is that what you are wanting, as much info as possible?
[00:52:21] <marler8997_> my thoughts on that are we could make the default experience be meant for the command-line users, and have IDE enable extra information with some sort of flag
[00:53:28] <ifreund> what extra information? I already have nice jump to error location support in my editor
[00:54:18] <andrewrk> marler8997_, you're asking what I am wanting - what I want is for the zig build system be as simple as possible and yet still handle gracefully the most complex projects. I'm already uncomfortable with the existence of --prominent-compile-errors and I want to kill it someday

[00:56:38] <marler8997_> I think identifying what is noise in a build is not simple, so in that case it sounds like you're willing to just print everything and let the user (and IDE's) decide what's noise rather than adding that complexity into the build system itself?
[00:59:12] <andrewrk> yes
[00:59:34] <marler8997_> ok fair enough, then in that case I don't think we should create a proposal for this since it doesn't align with your vision
[01:00:29] <marler8997_> andrewrk these discussion really help me alot btw, thank for taking the time to explain

[08:55:02] <motiejus> noob question: is there a way to attach context to an error (e.g. "error message")?
[08:55:38] <plumeus> Should probably be done by documenting the error?
[08:55:56] <plumeus> Or you could do `return error.@"Some arbitrary text";`

[08:56:10] *** Joins: poqomchi (~poqomchi@user/poqomchi)
[08:56:12] <plumeus> I think there was an open issue/proposal on this
[08:57:15] <motiejus> "Some arbitrary text" won't really work, as I want the callers to catch them. The guts of the library would return `error.InvalidVersion`, and then whoever uses the library could catch it and display a friendly message to the user ("supported versions: X, got: Y").
[08:58:04] <plumeus> Can't that be achieved with error handling?
[08:59:14] <motiejus> well, the only thing the caller knows is `error.InvalidVersion` (e.g. read an incompatible file), but there is no way to attach more information where the error was thrown

[08:59:51] <meekaale> I believe this is the relevant issue: https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/2647
[09:00:10] <plumeus> ah yes, the one I was looking for
[09:00:14] <motiejus> thanks, exactly. Will keep an eye on it
[09:00:21] <andrewrk> it's unlikely to be accepted fwiw
[09:00:59] <motiejus> we want to hear more :)
[09:02:04] <motiejus> you may hear crowd gathering :P
[09:06:22] <andrewrk> never mind what I said just now; I took a deeper look at CurtisFenner's last iteration on the proposal and I think it's worth considering
[09:10:45] <meekaale> right now there seem to be two main patterns: (1) writing the context into a pointer given by the caller, as in "fn foo(..., errorContext: *C) E!X"; or (2) using your own result type instead of Zig errors, as in "fn foo(...) C(X)"
[09:13:03] <plumeus> I love it when old proposals get the spotlight again
[09:14:59] <meekaale> [hi btw, I haven't been on IRC since like 2006, just got into Zig recently and I'm so delighted with it]
[09:16:07] <ifreund> welcome back to IRC!
[09:16:42] <plumeus> Zig is the only IRC channel I've joined
[09:17:05] <meekaale> I'm working on a little Lisp implementation in Zig with the intention of running in WebAssembly.  I wrote a first prototype in C because I'm more familiar with that, but now the Zig port is almost equivalent and Zig features are making the code nicer all over the place!
[09:18:26] <meekaale> especially nice is using compile-time type introspection to register builtin Zig functions as Lisp functions, which I was doing with obscure macros in C
[09:19:19] <meekaale> the test blocks encouraged me to use test-driven development for the whole thing so now I have a test suite almost by accident
[09:24:06] <meekaale> one thing I've been wondering is if it's possible to reference test blocks as functions, like say I want to have a button in my program that runs the program's own tests
[09:25:00] <meekaale> or just write my own test runner in some way, e.g. I want to run tests in the browser environment
[09:27:49] <plumeus> Make sure to spam `std.debug.assert` too.
[09:27:54] <andrewrk> welcome meekaale :)
[09:29:20] <andrewrk> here's the issue for a custom test runner: https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/6621
