[19:48:39] <jhass> is the plan to do it for all gems?
[19:49:08] <adam12> jhass[m]: Both obviously with their pros and cons, especially since some gems generate almost a gigabyte of docs, but one of my strategies is heavy compression for storage. And I don't use "the cloud" in the traditional sense, but rather I have my own platform and my own servers, so it's "reasonably" cheap for me to just rack a server with a bunch
[19:49:08] <adam12> of SSDs.
[19:50:12] <adam12> I'd like to do it for all gems, perhaps through the Rubygems webhook that I was using originally. Before I started gemdocs.org, I made an experiment to build docs for _every_ gem, and record sizes, to see if it was feasible.
[19:51:16] <adam12> But the current incarnation of the site is super simple, so I haven't added the webhook yet. I probably need to actually add a database (it uses the filesystem curently), and perhaps some sort of locking mechanism for parallel doc builds, and maybe a few other bits.
[19:51:17] <jhass> that's cool. I'd be curious about the ballpark numbers if you still have them
[19:51:31] <adam12> But I agressively add gems as I see htem.

[20:02:26] <adam12> jhass: https://github.com/adam12/build-docs-experiment
[20:02:47] <adam12> I regret not timestamping each record (and using sqlite up front), so it's hard to gauge the time span.
[20:03:56] <adam12> Largest gem for docs is `oci`, and compressed it's like 23MB. And the longest building gem is `rbt` and it takes over an hour to run `yard` on it.
[20:05:02] <adam12> The azure- gems are my biggest culprit right now tho. I shared some stats a few weeks back, where during the build it hit almost 1 GB of docs. I compress it down to like ~ 60 MB tho, which I guess is better than nothing. Indicative of why Loren won't store _everything_ on rubydoc.info.
[20:06:41] <jhass> so about 5G when compressed?
[20:07:00] <adam12> Which?
[20:07:08] <jhass> all in all
[20:08:07] <adam12> Ahh! That build log is the experimental one, so it doesn't reflect gemdocs.org, just what I was building via webhooks.
[20:08:17] <adam12> But actually right now, it's even less than that on gemdocs.org. Only about 210MB compressed.
[20:09:48] <jhass> yeah I mean that's more than managable. I think I'd look into a fast decompression algo, like zstd and a compressing filesystem that supports it
[20:10:38] <adam12> Well right now I have a huge hack, where I always gzip it, and always serve the gzip version (sorry ancient IE users :P)
[20:10:54] <adam12> but it was my _plan_ to use btrfs or ZFS, eventually.
