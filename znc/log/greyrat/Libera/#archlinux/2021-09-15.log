[03:53:07] <feinedsquirrel> I'm trying to create a slimmed down version of the arch iso for personal use. I disabled a few things that I don't need, and altered the packages.x86_64 file as needed. After removing a bunch of things related to the accessibility version (i.e. brltty, espeakup, and livecd-talk.service) my built iso is still 800 MB. Is there a flag or something I need? there is no man page for mkarchiso...
[03:53:57] <feinedsquirrel> and I've read a bunch of commit and merge notes in gitlab.archlinux.org as well as the whole archiso wiki page, but cannot figure it out.

[05:45:06] <Mysterytrain> so the IG is good enough for a complete neophyte
[05:45:24] <ectospasm> The install guide tries not to make any assumptions about what you want.  It has links to do it however you want, but you're likely going to have to consult a few pages to do exactly what you want
[05:45:47] <ectospasm> I did my first install without the luxury of another computer to use to consult the docs.
[05:45:51] *** Joins: Elodin (~Elodin@user/elodin)
[05:45:58] <GabCM> it makes sense the install guide is like that due to arch being user-centric as written in the arch way
[05:46:27] <Mysterytrain> yep
[05:46:30] <ectospasm> I wasn't in the habit of using screen or tmux, so I had multiple TTYs open, with elinks on various pages of the wiki.
[05:46:50] <ectospasm> That was fun, before I knew about the install guide package on the Arch ISO.
[05:47:03] <GabCM> I didn't even know about that
[05:47:05] <ectospasm> Not sure if it existed back then.

[05:49:45] <ectospasm> Turns out January 12, 1997 was a Sunday, and my class was on Monday.
[05:50:13] <Mysterytrain> i'm gradually working off windows into linux. going to run a w7 vm for those apps I do need windows for. w11 is just horsepucky, but I don't wana get to o.t
[05:50:28] <GabCM> I have a microsoft surface book 2 laptop with Windows 10 just in case
[05:50:48] <GabCM> but my main desktop is just arch. it acts as my home computer and my plex server
[05:51:03] <GabCM> gaming on linux went a long way
[05:51:06] <ectospasm> I have to use a Win10 VM for work, as the VPN client for two customers doesn't run on macOS (and I'm not allowed to run a Linux desktop).
[05:51:20] <ectospasm> I don't game, so I don't have that problem.
[05:51:32] <ectospasm> I was able to finish my master's program without owning a Windows machine

[05:53:17] <GabCM> I was a teen back then
[05:54:04] <GabCM> in fact I discovered Linux back when I was 12-13 years old, on TV, in a tech show, showing off Mandriva with the 3D windows and the whole computer-on-a-USB thing I was impressed

[11:34:08] <dav1d> run `systemctl --user restart some-service`
[11:34:40] <dav1d> I'll have to look into /etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d but according to SO this does not work
[11:35:50] <grawity> as a general rule, 1) system services do not have access to user stuff, 2) there *is* no "the currently logged in user" that they could by default have access to
[11:36:01] <grawity> the two methods for implementing this are
[11:36:16] <grawity> a) system service sends a signal over D-Bus, user process waits for that signal and restarts stuff
[11:36:32] <grawity> or b) system service uses the correct magic sudo invocation to access a specific UID's --user stuff
[11:37:04] <grawity> option b) is now a bit easier, because systemd has added support for `systemctl --user -M dav1d@.host`
[11:37:19] <dav1d> I would have opted for b), but how do I even get the event that the connection has been established
[11:37:33] * dav1d notes down -M

I know for a fact that there is a package available for it because it's listed here https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/fluxbox/ . How could I install it in this case? I see this is not a case of enabling multilib or etc

[16:10:50] <DF32> Hey. I'm having some issues setting the correct KEYMAP for virtual console (inside X works fine). If I use the command "loadkeymap" to test it works fine, I then set it in vconsole.conf and when rebooting the keymap is wrong inside virtual console. I did "find / -type f -name vconsole.* to look for some other file that may overwrite but there is
[16:10:51] <DF32> none. Does someone know why this may be happening?

[20:37:40] <Tom^> just because secure boot is on the topic, do you have to sign the kernel each time an update happends? i assume yes
[20:38:09] <Tom^> also i guess same deal with the systemd boot .efi file aswell
[20:38:10] <NetSysFire> yes but most secure boot helpers have a pacman hook to sign it automagically

[20:51:38] <powerman2206> Is the Audacity package before or after the telemetry stuff?
[20:51:46] <kib> before iirc
[20:51:56] <kib> it's over a year old at this point I think?
[20:51:58] <MacGyver> Foxboron: I would very much appreciate a writeup of what setup sbctl is (currently) built to handle.
[20:52:09] <MacGyver> I didn't understand that from the README.
[20:52:13] <powerman2206> kib: based
[20:52:14] <Foxboron> Mathisen: just read up on how to use shim-signed
[20:52:22] <foutrelis> Foxboron: :<
[20:52:27] <Foxboron> MacGyver: uhhh, like out of which cases it handles?
[20:52:31] <Mathisen> Foxboron, il do that
[20:52:49] <Foxboron> MacGyver: it only handles self-enrolled keys and signing files :p
[20:52:50] <MacGyver> Foxboron: Maybe my current impression clarifies what I mean.
[20:52:50] <Foxboron> that's it
[20:53:01] <Mathisen> i usaly try to stay away from AUR but i guess in this case i dont have any choice
[20:53:05] <MacGyver> Foxboron: "I can only use sbctl if I use the kernel efistub loader directly".
[20:53:26] <Foxboron> MacGyver: Ah okay. The stub loader is optional.
[20:53:38] <Foxboron> It's only implemented because mkinitcpio lacked the support

[23:45:06] <Alucard> Is there any way to remedy the system freeze?
[23:45:10] <thurstylark> may be worth watching something like htop to see what's maxing out
[23:45:32] <thurstylark> Alucard: depends on where the bottleneck really is
[23:45:34] <Alucard> at the moment it's VMware workstation
[23:45:50] <Alucard> because my VM just locked up when copying files from a host
[23:46:08] <demonicmaniac> if you have shittons of ram the defaults are pretty bad

[23:46:27] <Alucard> I have 196GB
[23:46:38] <Alucard> I did have 256GB. but I had to pull 64GB for an RMA
[23:46:59] <Alucard> Seems to be when the issue started actually, was a RAM issue but pulled the bad RAM.
[23:47:27] <Alucard> I've upgraded my bios, upgraded arch and upgraded VMware, same issue.
[23:47:29] <demonicmaniac> might not be the reason for your issue right now but it's a good idea to start writing earlier

[23:47:58] <demonicmaniac> default dirty background ratio is like 10? so it would take 20gb of data before it gets written to disk
[23:48:14] <Alucard> where do I check my current dirty background ratio?
[23:48:17] <demonicmaniac> easy to quickly hit dirty_ratio then and blocking io
[23:48:27] <obby> anyway i went to bed last night and woke up to my arch linux not coming out of sleep or whatever mode it is it entered while i was sleeping anyway i can check why?
[23:48:38] <demonicmaniac> sysctl -a
[23:48:39] <LiveWire> i agree with demonicmanic, i notice lag after the cache fills and the drive starts getting wrote too. sometimes pretty bad lag
[23:48:49] <obby> thanks

[23:49:56] <demonicmaniac> jesus christ your dirty and your dirty background are the same so ANY io will cause immediate blocking

[23:51:03] <Alucard> what would be the best to change them to?
[23:51:29] <Alucard> I think I vaguely remember changing them at some point, aimlessly following a guide.
[23:51:40] <demonicmaniac> dirty background is fine
[23:51:56] <demonicmaniac> dirty can be as high as you can spare in ram
[23:52:07] <demonicmaniac> dirty background is when it starts writing
[23:52:16] <demonicmaniac> dirty ratio is when it stops all io until all cache is flushed
[23:52:50] <Alucard> how do I change it? sorry, I'm not as clued up when it comes to linux.

[23:53:48] <Alucard> what would you recommend in my situtation?
[23:54:01] <demonicmaniac> and in /etc/sysctl.d/some.conf to change it permanently
[23:54:27] <demonicmaniac> i dont know what your memory load is and what general io is

[23:56:48] <Alucard> so, If I want to put 32GB RAM for dirty_bytes I'd put sysctl vm.dirty_bytes=3435972077 ?
[23:56:59] <Alucard> and do I need to change my dirty_ratio and background too?
