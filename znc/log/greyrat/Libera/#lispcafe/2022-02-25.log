[00:00:36] <selwyn> shka: what if a country decided to adopt that as a strategy to fight the virus
[00:01:25] <Alfr> shka, we'll need to do that for the control as well, to establish a base line.
[00:01:36] <shka> i have no idea, but medical academia won't like that
[00:01:56] <shka> and they would have problem publishing results actually 
[00:02:16] <selwyn> well, it is what britain decided to do at the start
[00:02:22] <shka> Alfr: yeah, imagine doing that with HIV virus 
[00:03:02] <shka> selwyn: really?
[00:03:05] <selwyn> uh
[00:03:12] <selwyn> well, not in the context of a/b testing of course
[00:03:22] <shka> right
[00:03:29] <selwyn> i see your point now
[00:03:58] <shka> as a future phd, i think you well understand importance of the ethical standards in science
[00:05:21] <selwyn> i appreciate that they are important
[00:05:34] <selwyn> i never have to deal with them though
[00:05:52] <selwyn> when your research output is equations it becomes a lot easier
[00:09:12] <shka> lol, don't buy Corona beer
[00:09:20] <shka> it is Russia owned
[00:09:29] <shka> Corona can't get a break xD
[00:10:37] <selwyn> chelsea might get nationalised
[00:11:08] <shka> would english football fans like it?
[00:11:22] <selwyn> it would be a very funny thing to happen in football
[00:12:02] <selwyn> shka: hard to say, i think the dominant reaction would be for other fans to make fun of them
[00:12:36] <shka> well, i don't know anything about soccer
[00:12:50] <shka> i know thing or two about starcraft and counter-strike 
[00:13:01] <shka> and it is IEM time
[00:13:08] <selwyn> there's a big contradiction in football culture where fans mobilise against the effects of big money, yet at the same time fans are often very happy when someone comes along to buy their club and save it from financial troubles
[00:13:34] <selwyn> saudi arabia bought a club and lots of their supporters are ecstatic
[00:13:40] <shka> i also like to watch woman long jump... for reasons 
[00:14:17] <selwyn> cultural reasons
[00:15:39] <shka> yes
[00:17:29] <shka> selwyn: and i guess you gonna need some real nice butt to jump far :P
[00:17:49] <shka> don't know how that works anatomically 
[00:18:33] <shka> but those muscles are mostly for pushing leg far back
[00:18:46] <shka> so i guess this covers jumping and sprinting
[00:21:10] <selwyn> i used to do sprinting and was told that i could do long jump
[00:21:25] <selwyn> hm
[00:22:42] <shka> so the real question
[00:22:51] <shka> how is your butt ;>
[00:23:10] <selwyn> certainly, the guy who told me i could do well in it
[00:23:13] <selwyn> didn't uh mention it :)
[00:23:36] <selwyn> in athletics, strength doesn't matter that much
[00:23:42] <selwyn> because you can train for it
[00:25:07] <selwyn> apparently the way i walk is predictive of jumping talent

[01:22:41] <epony> also known as, Josep' "iron" Maidan
[01:27:12] <epony> fake colour revolution, destabilisation and non-legitimate government installed by western inciters, who supplied weapons and armory to the military so it can attack its own territories in the eastern part of the country where strategic Russian interest objects are routed, for 8 years killing thousands of their own citizens, and Russia coming to stop the civil war.. US media calls that "war" and "invasion".. Such is US politics, just "media" and "weapon 
[01:27:12] <epony> sales", for installment of military contracts and capturing strategic position threatening everyone and behaving like the world military police, with thousands and thousands of bases on foreign land, encircling and approaching Russian republics converting them to enemies through puppet governments..
[01:29:01] <epony> "I don't know"  --US president commanding the world largest military super power ordering military deployments near the border of a former rival superpower
[01:29:04] <waleee> this might be the time for a timely mute me thinks
[01:30:00] <epony> waleee, you're a NATO military base, so shut the fuck up
[01:30:26] <waleee> sigh and why the f didn't that take immediately
[01:32:05] <epony> if Finland and Norway were being converted to an enemy military aggressive superpower system and nuclear missiles pointing at your towns were installed, you'd understand
[01:33:07] <waleee> ? Ukraine _gave_ Russia their inherited nukes specifically becuase they promised to not do shenanigans like this 
[01:33:42] <epony> such weapons are deployed in Romania and Poland and on ships near the Crimean peninsular, property of USA and France militaries
[01:33:48] <waleee> but have fun in the echo chamber now

[01:36:42] <epony> UA is controlled via a puppet government since 2012-2014 (there were such attempts several times before that) with foreign control turned against its own people and against its neighbours from the same former common union and country historically
[01:39:50] <epony> The real aggressor is US and FR miliaries procuring TR wartime interests against Crime and the Ukraine to weaken the economic and political systems and prevent Russia from continuing its development and protection of neighbour countries so the destructive expansion of fundamental terrorism can invade the former eastern block.. not going to happen, obviously
[01:42:55] <epony> There is no justification for giving weapons to neighbours and turning them against each other, and that is exactly what US foreign policy does as a continuation of western European military colonialism, however US is on the loose since the last century big wars were not on its territory and it supplied most of the weapons and funding for the western powers.. and continues this.

[02:46:43] <vms14> hayley: ahahahaha I put pop and didn't see any hint or completion from slime so thought it wasn't
[02:47:37] <vms14> I'll change it
[02:47:40] <gilberth> And POP would take care not evaluate things twice :-p

[02:49:15] <vms14> I used it in another forth-like try
[02:50:16] <vms14> btw this time you can add words to the execution words list
[02:50:33] <vms14> and can get the next quoted word or execute it

[02:52:56] * vms14 realizes he stills hearing Loreena McKennitt 
[02:55:17] <vms14> and the words which are lists of words (non primitive words) are just flattened and put on the execution list
[02:56:30] <gilberth> Can vms14lang craft such a list to be taken as a list of operations to execute at run time?
[02:57:03] <vms14> can't create a list for now

[03:13:29] <hayley> Sadly they use Python, so I can't do any funny optimisations. ):
[03:13:47] <gilberth> Somehow the speed of my list growing is decreasing with time. I must be doing sth wrong.
[03:14:42] <hayley> "What data structure should you use to evaluate a mathematical expression?"
[03:14:45] <hayley> Let's see...
[03:14:54] <hayley> If it's in RPN, a stack.
[03:15:02] <dave0> gilberth: that's what happens when you get old.. everything slows down ;-)
[03:15:10] <hayley> If you want it to go fast, you make a CFG.
[03:15:30] <gilberth> dave0: Nah, somehow time accelerates with age. Sad.
[03:15:50] <hayley> If you have redundant expressions, you might use a hash table to memoise intermediate results.
[03:15:56] <dave0> it's like reverse relativity
[03:16:00] <hayley> But, most certainly, you will never use a tree.
[03:16:05] <gilberth> hayley: A string? That uses less memory and thus must be fast!
[03:16:37] <dave0> time speeds up, but everything takes longer
[03:16:49] <vms14> gilberth: then you've learned a lot
[03:17:14] <gilberth> dave0: Perhaps. But maybe I also ran out of interesting concepts to read up about?

[03:19:04] <vms14> what I see is people is getting more and more to functional programming
[03:19:14] <gilberth> hayley: That's just a clever algorithm, not a new concept.
[03:19:16] <vms14> but as lisper you know, they're just taking lisp features
[03:19:51] <gilberth> hayley: If you go this route, I could state that submatch addressing with DFAs has been solved.
[03:19:55] <vms14> and people is going somehow to ai, but in a different way
[03:20:11] <vms14> the trend is big data, and ai is working with big data
[03:20:28] <vms14> they make programs learn to write random stuff by making them read text
[03:20:36] <dave0> i guess a more serious answer is quantum computing? how long has that been around?
[03:20:53] <gilberth> Sure, but all no new programming paradigm. It's just that machines got faster and mass storage dirty cheap.

[03:21:32] <gilberth> dave0: I attended quantum computing lectures as a student. More than 20 years ago.

[03:21:50] <hayley> gilberth: That's easy for you to say.

[03:22:26] <selwyn> however, i am not sure if there will be 'quantum programmers' after that

[03:23:17] <vms14> which remembers me Salomon said: All things are wearisome, more than one can describe; the eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear content with hearing. 9What has been will be again, and what has been done will be done again; there is nothing new under the sun. 10Is there a case where one can say, "Look, this is new"? It has already existed in the ages before us.
[03:23:24] <gilberth> hayley: It's solved, isn't it?
[03:24:40] <vms14> so yes, nothing new
[03:24:54] <hayley> gilberth: Yes, but you came up with the only actually POSIX-compliant solution.
[03:25:09] <hayley> I didn't say "replicated object systems" as my first answer.
[03:25:41] <gilberth> And that's depressing at times. Also that people are still afraid of things like *gasp* runtime type checking and GC.
[03:25:49] <vms14> and if you think a bit, we're not able to create new things
[03:26:15] <vms14> new things are just a different way to group stuff that existed before
[03:26:22] <vms14> or a different way to use it
[03:26:52] <vms14> what you think is inspiration is just mixing some stuff to make something "new"
[03:26:52] <gilberth> Well apart from the philosophical question if things are invented or rather discovers, we certainly can.
[03:27:18] <vms14> and the more "inspired" you are the better you'll mix the stuff
[03:28:10] <gilberth> It's not like e.g. Lisp is obvious after you invented the relay.
[03:28:11] <vms14> gilberth: in programming if there is something "new" it's likely they made the computer able to process some concepts that only existed in life, but not in computers
[03:28:17] <vms14> ex: logic programming
[03:28:22] <dave0> my friend has "ideas"
[03:28:39] <vms14> I have a lot of ideas, my imagination is my best feature
[03:28:39] <dave0> as in he starts something and never finishes :-p
[03:28:54] <vms14> dave0: hah he has the same curse as me
[03:29:19] <vms14> we loose interest very fast because a new idea come
[03:29:42] <gilberth> I am also like that. This is because after solved the initial puzzle, the work to complete it is just tedious and boring.
[03:29:45] <vms14> and this new idea looks more shiny than the actual one
[03:30:05] <moon-child> hayley: object capabilities are very old

[03:30:42] <vms14> hayley: how can you say you're a functional programmer and have an object farm at same time
[03:31:13] <hayley> When did I say I was a functional programmer?
[03:31:14] <moon-child> I would be shocked to hear hayley refer to herself as a functional programmer
[03:31:29] <moon-child> shocked enough eat several hats!
[03:31:29] <dave0> dysfunctional
[03:31:42] <hayley> moon-child: Note I said ocap _ language_.
[03:31:49] <vms14> how dare you not being a functional programmer
[03:31:53] <moon-child> mmm fair
[03:32:34] <hayley> Newspeak handles modularity by explicitly passing in modules when instantiating a new module, rather than an ambient authority called a namespace. FCGEs are similar enough to warrant mention IMO.

[03:33:38] <hayley> vms14: Though Dylan and Scala are considered object-functional languages, and CLOS's reliance on generic functions is not dissimilar to typeclasses if you squint.
[03:34:14] <gilberth> Is there any difference between Dylan and CL but the syntax?
[03:34:29] <moon-child> I also want to know the answer to that
[03:34:34] <hayley> Dylan is Lisp-1I'd guess.
[03:34:34] <moon-child> I hear they even have a clim clone
[03:34:51] <hayley> DUIM, which has no climactic jokes.
[03:35:05] <gilberth> Yep, essentially the Silica part.
[03:35:34] <gilberth> I borrowed a few tiny bits from DUIM for McCLIM.
[03:36:29] <hayley> Hm, using region types for references was a 2000s thing AIUI, with Cyclone.
[03:37:05] <gilberth> Somewhere in the AI repository you find a prototype Dylan based on CMUCL. I don't recall if it has the Pascalque syntax already.
[03:37:39] <vms14> xd how fool I am
[03:37:53] <hayley> Of course, not pissing yourself with incorrect stack allocation was a 1988 thing due to Henry Baker.
[03:37:55] <vms14> looking for ghostscript where the executable is named gs
[03:38:17] <gilberth> I told you to fire up "gs", didn't I?
[03:38:30] <vms14> idk
[03:38:39] <gilberth> I did. :-)
[03:38:46] <vms14> but oh, I have a window opened where will be the generated pdf
[03:39:01] <gilberth> gs -dNODISPLAY
[03:39:03] <vms14> can I use it as a gui library?
[03:39:20] <vms14> I mean, could I just make some gui app with gs
[03:39:40] <gilberth> Nope. You miss input events and the renderer is slow. I contemplated once to use ghostscript for graphics output.
[03:39:43] <vms14> I suppose has no input stuff
[03:39:49] <vms14> but there are links
[03:40:02] <vms14> gilberth: oh
[03:40:34] <gilberth> Well, you could pass Ghostscript an existing window to render to. You could still receive input events from that window if you wish.
[03:40:44] <vms14> 1 2 + ==
[03:40:44] <vms14> Error: /undefined in +
[03:40:51] <vms14> that's was the line you gave me?

[03:41:13] <gilberth> "1 2 add ==" The == is for printing TOS.
[03:41:58] <vms14> nice
[03:42:23] <vms14> I have a slow gui forth :D
[03:42:47] <gilberth> Anyhow, a pity. Doing graphics output with PS would have been nice in the 90s. These days there is Cairo at least.
[03:42:51] <vms14> and I've donwloaded the reference manual
[03:43:40] <gilberth> That's great! Play a bit with the language. I know a bit of PS. You know where to find me.
[03:44:04] <vms14> yes, in the lispers inn
[03:44:31] <gilberth> The one single place I like to hide at, yes.
[03:45:08] <vms14> I'll eat something and play with gs
[03:45:17] <vms14> and cry to you if something happens
[03:45:52] <vms14> but don't be waiting for me to ask something if you have to do stuff
[03:46:08] <vms14> and maybe I don't ask xd
[03:46:32] <gilberth> Nah, I live here. ;)
[03:46:53] <vms14> thanks for the recomendation, it seems I'll see stuff I have to see
[03:47:11] <vms14> yet a bit late (I'm not a very obedient person)
[03:48:18] <gilberth> BTW gs is pretty fast. It beats CLISP for the FIB benchmark.
[03:48:32] <gilberth> The interpreter that is.
[03:50:25] <moon-child> does postscript box, or is it all word-sized integers like forth?
[03:50:39] <moon-child> if the latter, then there is no type checking and no dispatch to deal with.  So I am not surprised
[03:51:37] <hayley> "Assume for an undirected graph with 7 vertices and 13 edges that a vertex index requires 3 bytes, and a pointer requires 5 bytes" How many bytes in a pointer??
[03:51:46] <gilberth> PS does typechecking. And there are both fixnums and flonums.
[03:52:01] <gilberth> Though fixnum overflow to flonums.
[03:52:04] <moon-child> I should only use 3 bits for a pointer
[03:52:13] <moon-child> when you only have 7 vertices, why would you need more?
[03:52:26] * hayley bonks moon-child
[03:53:31] <gilberth> PS is a dynamically typed safe language.

[03:54:12] <hayley> This "Space Requirements for Graph Representations" section is literally entirely implementation detail. 0/10
[03:54:41] <hayley> And there is no mention of allocation alignment, interior fragmentation, or anything else of the sort. Useless.

[05:10:36] <neominimum> I wonder if high fidelity meta spaces could have the effect of actually inhibiting potential collaboration between individuals in some instances. The greater the information that individuals present about themselves the greater the opportunity for individual aesthetic preferences, personal bias, prejudice, etc. to trigger competitive/anti-social behavior. Even just the setting of the space may contribute to such behaviour.

[05:46:22] <White_Flame> the notion of social media is the core problem of that, instead of having individual identities per interaction space
[05:47:01] <neominimum> That being said I have personally always liked the idea of virtual realities. But we may never be able to make the experience seamless enough without invasive procedures, which I am not really a fan of. Has anyone read Livewired by David Eagleman? There were some experiments described in the book where researchers created an electro-tactile display to present neurons in the skin (in this case, the toungue) with essentially a memory mapped 
[05:47:01] <neominimum> lo-fi encoding from a camera(I believe it encoded luminosity). Blind test subjects were able to eventually integrate the information received from the device and the brain formed an actual external projection of the information as a perception, once it figured out the information resembled the local environment. Something it could understand. Pretty cool I think.
[05:47:02] <White_Flame> and this is already a "low fidelity meta space"
[05:47:09] <White_Flame> which is a good thing
[05:48:51] <neominimum> I wrote that mostly as a reaction to the strawman that says "Metaverse is going to be a gamechanger". Yeah I already consider irc a low fidelity meta space.

[05:54:11] <neominimum> Yeah as I recall the book kinda blew my mind, It was the first time I had learnt of the brains very powerful capability to recognise patterns and then form perceptions from them, regardless of the source of the information. I never really considered that you'd be able to see using your skin!

[15:03:42] * contrapunctus cannot decide on what kind of database to use. Offline and client-side only (for the moment), but schemas are intended to be different for each user...and a query language intuitive for a non-programming user is a big plus...
[15:04:03] <moon-child> is there any answer other than sqlite?
[15:05:16] <contrapunctus> I was wondering if CouchDB might be a fit.
[15:06:39] * moon-child doesn't understand why not sqlite.  In any situation not requiring postgres
[15:06:57] <moon-child> 'It uses JSON to store data, JavaScript as its query language using MapReduce'  u w0t

[15:07:43] <hayley> When in doubt, use an in-memory database. Then, when that doesn't work, SQL (though idk for the "intuitive for a non-programming user" part).
[15:08:43] <moon-child> there are some nice demos of q requests being 4-5x smaller than the equivalent sql
[15:08:44] <shka> that's what it was designed for
[15:08:49] <shka> it didn't work out
[15:08:51] <moon-child> (in tokens, not chars, to be clear)
[15:11:37] <contrapunctus> moon-child: I'm sure it's possible to make an SQL schema which is user-extensible, but I'm not sure if it's recommended... 🤔
[15:11:37] <contrapunctus> hayley: interesting...noted.
[15:14:27] <kakuhen> i use xml as a database and regexes to query data
[15:15:04] <moon-child> kakuhen pls
[15:15:51] <contrapunctus> kakuhen: I was also considering 's-expressions + read' for the prototype stage 😄
[15:31:05] <kakuhen> <moon-child> "kakuhen pls" <- i saw someone trying to do this recently
[15:31:18] <kakuhen> setting up sqlite is too hard anyway

[23:53:21] <gilberth> I always find all the little unorthogonalities in CL intriguing and wonder if those are by intent or by accident. E.g. I can say (defun (setf foo) ...), but I can't say (defmacro (setf foo) ...). Which perhaps is because I can't say ((setf foo) ...). But then: Why not?
[23:54:58] <shka> i used to think that's because #'(setf foo) is supposed to work, but i don't know anymore
[23:57:02] <gilberth> Well, (defun foo () #'bar) compiles file although BAR could later be either still funboundp or defined as a macro.
[23:58:08] <shka> maybe it is because macros are supposed to defined before expanding can happen and that would be confusing with setf?
[23:58:19] <shka> i really don't know
[23:59:09] <shka> i wonder if Ukraine war will still be ongoing next week
