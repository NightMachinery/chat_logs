[02:24:02] <macrobat> boccherini is a little classic
[02:24:04] <artao> um .... not "fix"
[02:24:05] <Panther> Probably if you heat it in the right place.

[02:25:15] <macrobat> is it a fix when you loosen something that should be loose?
[02:25:39] <artao> perhaps temporary
[02:26:14] <artao> but if you don't clean out and replace said oil it'll just happen again. so it's not really "fixed." just temporarily working

[02:32:35] <artao> or Clamato

[04:45:53] <murthy> Yesterday I tried a musical instrument tuning mobile app. It had some unknown notes to me. I had known of C, D, E, F, G, A, B but didn't know about F5, A3 or like those
[04:46:28] <murthy> after reading about the voice range text, It seems there are scientific expression
[04:46:47] <murthy> traditionally they are called like  C middle of A or something
[04:46:59] <murthy> I am yet to understand them
[04:47:47] <murthy> can you people tell what voice range a person has by listening to their voice or they are measured using a device?
[04:48:46] <murthy> for example what voice range does Stockard Channing has?
[04:49:25] <murthy> I assume those are traditional voice ranges that were liked by people?
[04:57:47] <morf> he assumes 
[04:58:01] <efex_> there are 4 genral voice ranges that singers can manage
[04:58:46] <efex_> low, led-medim, medium, and high
[04:59:08] <efex_> some singers can manage more than one
[04:59:13] <efex_> that’s all
[04:59:50] <efex_> that could have been5 ranges… or three
[05:00:33] <efex_> but 4 notes is a great number of notes for a choir to sing.. so 4 ranges matches that

[05:08:16] <efex_> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vocal_range
[05:08:16] <Janet> ^ Vocal range is the range of pitches that a human voice can phonate. A common application is within the context of singing, where it is used as a defining characteristic for classifying singing voices into voice types.
[05:08:24] <efex_> ok
[05:08:28] <efex_> 40 years ago
[05:08:55] <efex_> The ranges given below are approximations and are not meant to be too rigidly applied.[10][failed verification]
[05:08:56] <efex_>     Soprano: the highest female voice, being able to sing C4 (middle C) to C6 (high C), and possibly higher.
[05:08:57] <efex_>     Mezzo-soprano: a female voice between A3 (A below middle C) and A5 (2nd A above middle C).
[05:08:59] <efex_>     Contralto: the lowest female voice, F3 (F below middle C) to E5 (2nd E above Middle C). Rare contraltos possess a range similar to the tenor.
[05:09:00] <efex_>     Tenor: the highest male voice, B2 (2nd B below middle C) to A4 (A above middle C), and possibly higher.
[05:09:01] <efex_>     Baritone: a male voice, G2 (two Gs below middle C) to F4 (F above middle C).
[05:09:02] <efex_>     Bass: the lowest male voice, E2 (two Es below middle C) to E4 (the E above middle C).
[05:09:37] *** Beverly is now known as Prints
[05:11:22] <murthy> so it would be Bass>Baritone>Tenor>Contralto>Mezzo-soprano>Soprano in the frequency range?
[05:11:29] <Panther> I can get down to C2, but it isn't a very strong sound, and it has rather poor timbre with no vibrato.
[05:11:40] <murthy> is Soprano voice range is the one that can break glasses?
[05:12:02] <murthy> also what does Mezzo mean?
[05:13:31] <murthy> watching this one https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Tkbkjo7ECk
[05:13:38] <Janet> ^ Contralto, Mezzo & Soprano - Low & High Notes - YouTube
[05:14:20] <Panther> The highest I can typically get to without a falsetto is F4, but that is also not such a great sound. However, I can blend into falsetto very smoothly, so if I have to sing high, I just do that.
[05:15:14] <efex_> the vocal ranges are made for “good tone”, not “not can possible hit but the tone is not useful” tho :-)
[05:15:51] <murthy> oh wow, this is very interesting
[05:16:04] <murthy> ya
