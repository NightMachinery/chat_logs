[03:51:07] <tpefreedom> Unfortunately, I had to install the noonfree installer and then remove all the crap because the main installer didn't incluude ath9k_htc even though it is free.

[03:53:27] <tpefreedom> Fedora is nice. Too bad it doesn't even offer a linux-libre installer.
[03:53:41] <Kolev> tpefreedom: Yeah, it took a while to figure out how to install linux-libre.

[04:16:49] <rber> it might sound obvious but I think you can only license the project with GPL, not the product
[04:18:41] <M6piz7wk[m]> I want to license the ECAD files for the product
[04:18:59] <M6piz7wk[m]> like the things you put in KiCAD to design the circuit boards etc..
[04:19:20] <M6piz7wk[m]> it's so annoying that FSF doesn't have a license for this..
[04:22:42] <rber> maybe you are going to need to found the FHF for that 
[04:23:35] <rber> not sure what's the issue with using GPLv3 for that though
[04:24:52] <M6piz7wk[m]> bcs GPLv3 refer to everything as software and the wording is inapropriate
[04:27:07] <lispmacs[work]> M6piz7wk[m]: an approach I have seen is to license all the schematic files and such as creative commons share alike
[04:27:39] <lispmacs[work]> and if "invention" is involved, assign your patents to the open invention network
[04:27:55] <M6piz7wk[m]> Apparently the TAPR OPL is alternative of GPLv3 for hardware https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TAPR_Open_Hardware_License

[04:31:13] <rber> cc-sa seems to fit

[04:32:07] <rber> if any
[04:32:15] <M6piz7wk[m]> lispmacs[work]: i know, but it's not enough for my usecase.. i want something that requires to be designed only in Free Software designer and ran on Free Hardware
[04:32:19] <M6piz7wk[m]> ideally..
[04:32:38] <M6piz7wk[m]> or just Hardware License that follows FSF's phylosophy to use, share, study and improve
[04:32:44] <rber> but I don't see the word free software in that article
[04:33:53] <rber> it seems to be talking about other types of freedoms... but maybe that's just me
[04:34:14] <M6piz7wk[m]> rber: The definition is from political field not computer science so it's more elaborative 
[04:34:34] <M6piz7wk[m]> but afaik the whole technoliberalism is inspired by RMS and goes further with the requirement for decetralization
[04:35:58] <lispmacs[work]> M6piz7wk[m]: when you say "free hardware" do you mean the whole board has to be containing only ICs that have no IP restrictions and no non-disclosure agreements?
[04:36:20] <lispmacs[work]> or something else?
[04:36:21] <rber> that article looks like a good read, not sure if I read it before
[04:37:09] <lispmacs[work]> there are many "free hardware" projects in the sense that the layout of the board is released under some license like CC share alike
[04:37:26] <lispmacs[work]> but non at all I've ever heard of where the individual ICs are free hardware
[04:37:51] <M6piz7wk[m]> lispmacs[work]: i am not aware of it being possible to use components that follow the technoliberal philosophy so i argue for the board design with any component with preference for Libre whenever possible.
[04:37:51] <M6piz7wk[m]> FWIW the end-goal is smartphone where i want to suggest the license to PINE64 to fork pinephone.
[04:37:53] <lispmacs[work]> all free hardware, I meam
[04:38:50] <M6piz7wk[m]> rber: ye i use the term technoliberal in politics to avoid people thinking that i want to put their software under the rule of socialism.. it's very important in the EU to use proper terms
[04:39:23] <M6piz7wk[m]> bcs you can say FLOSS and political parties such as VoltEurope will use that to define OSI non-free hardware
[04:39:53] <rber> isn't there some free hardware cpu
[04:40:02] <rber> zCPU is free FPGA isn't it
[04:40:29] <rber> https://www.eetimes.com/mips-r6-architecture-now-available-for-open-use/
[04:40:30] <M6piz7wk[m]> lispmacs[work]: that's the projected best case scenario.. phone composed of only Libre components with it's ECAD files released with patents handling and being compatible with GPLv3 ideas
[04:41:11] <M6piz7wk[m]> bcs i have OnePlus2 that i've heavily modified and it's getting to the point of unreasonable to use it for my threat model  as it's basically just full of jumper wires to ensure the expected security and privacy
[04:41:28] <rber> M6piz7wk[m] if you think free software makes any sense in socialism, maybe you didn't read the license closely. It forbids commercialization for instance. Not very commie on that
[04:41:48] <rber> oops
[04:41:53] <rber> it forbids you to restrict commercialization
[04:42:03] <M6piz7wk[m]> rber: i don't but we have lot of lobbying groups in the EU that does it's best to confuse voters to support OSI values while thinking that they support FLOSS
[04:42:25] <rber> right
[04:42:54] <rber> still don't see how mixing free software with technoliberalism helps in that though
[04:43:34] <M6piz7wk[m]> in politics you follow the idea for which you define the laws.. so you have democracy, liberalism, communism, concervatism, etc.. on which you build up the phylosophy

[04:44:37] <M6piz7wk[m]> people who matter in politics has to specify everything as room that is open for interpretation is very problematic as your political opponents can use that against you
[04:45:07] <M6piz7wk[m]> same as with writting law and alike.. you want to specify as much as possible to leave out any room for implementation

[05:00:33] <lispmacs[work]> "You make a hardware design free by releasing it under a free license. We recommend using the GNU General Public License, version 3 or later. We designed GPL version 3 with a view to such use."
[05:01:29] <lispmacs[work]> RMS goes on to say, however:
[05:01:34] <lispmacs[work]> "Copyleft on circuits, and on nondecorative object shapes, doesn't go as far as one might suppose. The copyright on these designs only applies to the way the design is drawn or written. Copyleft is a way of using copyright law, so its effect carries only as far as copyright law carries.
[05:01:34] <lispmacs[work]> For instance, a circuit, as a topology, cannot be copyrighted (and therefore cannot be copylefted). Definitions of circuits written in HDL can be copyrighted (and therefore copylefted), but the copyleft covers only the details of expression of the HDL code, not the circuit topology it generates. Likewise, a drawing or layout of a circuit can be copyrighted, so it can be copylefted, but this only covers the drawing o
[05:01:34] <lispmacs[work]> r layout, not the circuit topology. Anyone can legally draw the same circuit topology in a different-looking way, or write a different HDL definition that produces the same circuit."
[05:01:35] <rber> I just think you might not have that the prototypes and products are regarded as artifacts

[05:07:14] <M6piz7wk[m]> about which we should have a phylosophical discussion as i don't know whether it's appropriate to require manufacturers to only the hardware and only require payment for the resources that they put to it e.g. like USB flash disks with software

[05:10:15] <lispmacs[work]> what you are saying doesn't make semantic sense. The manufacturers don't own any of the technology licenses... you pay them and then they manufacture your design
[05:10:45] <lispmacs[work]> if you allow anybody in the world to manufacture your design, those people will still have to pay the manufactures
[05:11:56] <lispmacs[work]> on OSHPARK, for example, you can submit a PCB design to them, and then tell them you want to "share" your design publicly
[05:12:12] <lispmacs[work]> then anyway can pay OSHPARK to print off that PCB

[05:16:05] <lispmacs[work]> I don't quite see how you have a a "free hardware license" that requires anybody who uses your design to have a "free hardware project" without being very specific what you mean by that
[05:19:24] <lispmacs[work]> you can just make you schematics and such free, and then make your patents all royalty free, as much as you can claim patents on the ideas involved
[05:20:25] * lispmacs[work] heads home
[05:20:41] <rber> have a good one
[05:25:37] <M6piz7wk[m]> <lispmacs[work]> "what you are saying doesn't make..." <- i meant manufacturers that have a monetary interest in the design like people making a different display for the projected phone and charging +X % more for it.
[05:25:48] <M6piz7wk[m]> as those should then be subjected to the same license
[05:30:41] <rber> you really should read the article I guess, lispmacs[work] also quoted them and explained that people will still be able to draw similar designs and achieve the same result without incurring in any IP breach
[05:31:44] <rber> I think that's the main thing that prevents you from having free hardware that affects more than the designs, software, drawings, and other project files subject to copyright
[05:34:42] <rber> maybe you should consider patents and doing a grant of patent of your liking

[05:40:51] <M6piz7wk[m]> i don't want to read licenses.. The ideal scenario would be something FSF-endorsed and claimed compatible with values of GPLv3 for me to quote to PINE64 for ECAD designs.. 
[05:41:12] * M6piz7wk[m] is not developing his own hardware license yet to justify processing these licenses like that
[05:41:37] <rber> well you're not going to get anywhere whatsoever without wanting to read
[05:42:00] <rber> sorry if I am being too blunt
[05:42:03] <M6piz7wk[m]> like i read them, but that is not what the usecase is..
[05:42:29] <rber> I was talking about only the section that was a patent grant
[05:43:28] <rber> I'm sure that applies to any patent
[05:43:37] <M6piz7wk[m]> i know, but i don't know what kind of phylosophy should be adapted for this use as from the view of software these should be banned at all cost, but in hardware they might make sense?
[05:44:26] <rber> that's cause software is subject to copyright
[05:44:51] <M6piz7wk[m]> So is hardware design and ECAD files 
[05:45:21] <rber> > people will still be able to draw similar designs and achieve the same result without incurring in any IP breach
[05:45:26] <M6piz7wk[m]> but different rules apply as those probably can't be justified as mathematical data to be excluded from patents
[05:46:22] <rber> that is also true for software but I think it is considerably less advantageous

[05:48:29] <rber> seriously
[05:48:34] <rber> it does cover that

[05:48:48] *** Joins: AwesomeAdam54321 (~adam@42.188.15.6)
[05:48:59] <rber> I would just start from the beginning
[05:49:15] <M6piz7wk[m]> i read that multiple times already it doesn't even mention CAD
[05:49:28] <rber> but there is a whole section about 3d printing for instance
[05:49:42] <rber> it's basically the same for circuit printing
[05:49:58] <rber> except it's less likely that you print them at home
[05:52:09] <M6piz7wk[m]> i don't feel like ECAD applies in that, but i don't feel qualified to answer that
[05:52:18] <M6piz7wk[m]> you can make custom circuit boards at home for pennies 
[05:54:04] <M6piz7wk[m]> Like i see the ECAD files as source code that just produces hardware rather then software where RMS seems to be referring to instructions how to make the 3D parts instead of having a human readable and workable source code
[05:58:02] <M6piz7wk[m]> aldo RMS suggest GPLv3 for these things.. might not be a bad idea to sent an email on licensing@fsf.org to ask
[05:59:19] <iShareFreedom> the channels of free software in spanish are so dead :(
[05:59:46] <M6piz7wk[m]> bcs none on the earth speaks spanish~
[05:59:50] * M6piz7wk[m] hides
[06:00:48] <iShareFreedom> whats mean bcs?
[06:01:04] <M6piz7wk[m]> rber: Also i think i am right on the interpretation of the RMS's words since he refers to RYF to recommend 3D printers like https://ryf.fsf.org/products/LulzBotMini that are nowhere near Free Hardware as they lack the ECAD files..
[06:01:12] <M6piz7wk[m]> bcs = BeCauSe
[06:01:40] <M6piz7wk[m]> ... but he seems to refer only to the source code RUN on this hardware
[06:02:14] <M6piz7wk[m]> ... same for basically everything on RYF.. there are no ECAD files anywhere
[06:02:52] <AwesomeAdam54321> Is making custom hardware affordable, or is it still really expensive?
[06:03:37] <M6piz7wk[m]> super affordable
[06:03:47] <M6piz7wk[m]> well if you have the ECAD files
[06:05:05] <rber> estás muy equivocado, hermano
[06:05:14] <M6piz7wk[m]> Like i want to fork pinephone to add NFC and fingerprint sensor, but PINE64 only provides schematics
[06:05:14] <M6piz7wk[m]> So currently i need to do approx. 1200 EUR worth of work assuming minimal wage per hour to import those files in KiCAD to just begin the work..
[06:06:23] <M6piz7wk[m]> where the work of adding NFC and fingerprint are approx. <150 EUR
[06:06:23] <M6piz7wk[m]> and outsourcing the PCBs for manufacturing and shipping is <5 EUR per one.
[06:06:37] <M6piz7wk[m]> if you can't make them at home that is..
[06:06:42] <M6piz7wk[m]> in which case it's pennies 
[06:07:35] <M6piz7wk[m]> bcs 15 EUR for 1 kg of fibreglass blanks, pennies for copper wire and pennies for solder mask 
[06:07:57] <M6piz7wk[m]> where the 15 EUR can be taken further down with using flexible glass design
[06:08:52] * M6piz7wk[m] is prototyping flexible glass + pure silver to make them easily recyclable by just throwing the parts in the kylm where they separete in solids of silver and glass
[06:09:14] <M6piz7wk[m]> that separate itself after they cool down and can be reused with 0 waste 
[06:09:31] <M6piz7wk[m]> .. and 0 pollution depending on the heat source used for the oven

[19:58:57] <bingfengzs> I have developed a free software, which is a chat robot, but currently only supports converting Chinese question sentences into answer sentences. Can it enter the software directory of fsf?

[20:33:51] <bingfengzs> They are fsf-certified GNU/Linux user groups, but recently I discovered that two of them, "persmule" and "nadebula", distorted the RMS's free software thought results into "communism", and they felt that RMS should not be Use peaceful reforms to promote free software, advocate that the so-called "dictatorship" should be used to promote software freedom, and use a sophistication to promote to others that "free software is public ownership"; now many

[20:35:17] <craigt> All GLUGs should be Libreplanet groups IMO :) <https://libreplanet.org/wiki/LibrePlanet:Teams>
[20:35:49] <tfisgnag> Using your last week link (https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.txt ) I haven't found a way to save both licenses in the same folder.
[20:36:16] <tfisgnag> The Abrowser little window that makes downloading easy doesn't appear.
[20:36:29] <tfisgnag> So I visited https://www.gnu.org/licenses/ looking for links that trigger Abrowser's downloader.
[20:36:48] <tfisgnag> I discovered a new world I'll have to explore in detail some other day
[20:37:05] <craigt> tfisgnag: Exploring is half the fun!

[20:38:54] <hwpplayer1> what is the issue with A2ps craigt
[20:39:06] <craigt> bingfengzs: I'm also not aware of fsf-certified GLUGS.
[20:39:33] <bingfengzs> In addition, I have a question. Mindustry games are licensed under GPLv3, so they should conform to the standard. Why are they not in the directory?
[20:39:42] <bingfengzs> https://anuke.itch.io/mindustry
[20:39:56] <craigt> hwpplayer1: No issues. Usernumber9 has just been doing some house keeping on the Directory and their edits need approval.
[20:40:04] <bingfengzs> @craigt
[20:40:34] <craigt> bingfengzs: Somebody needs to add them (after verifying the licensing of course)
[20:40:50] <David_Hedlund> craigt: We could list GLUGs on https://www.gnu.org/distros/free-distros.en.html
[20:42:25] <craigt> bingfengzs: I hope it is free software, mindustry looks cool!
[20:43:24] <tfisgnag> craigt: I think I need to find a site where Abrowser's downloader can select the trustworthy version of agpl-3.0.txt  to downloaded and move it to the same folder as Mailvelope's version is. 
[20:43:26] <craigt> David_Hedlund: Not so sure about that. That pages is just for distros.
[20:43:46] <bingfengzs> Now my question is, why doesn’t the author of mindustry add separate licenses to the images and music in it? If only the code is free, but if the textures and music that the game relies on are non-free, will the software be judged non-free?

[21:07:00] <Noisytoot> David_Hedlund, Does that include GLUGs with both users of free and non-free distros?
[21:07:22] <craigt> The general consensus is game art isn't software, but I don't think you can say that for every game. It would have to be on a case by case basis.

[22:55:15] <lispmacs[work]> that are non-free
[22:56:21] <rber> but even when you are running an entirely free system such as Guix, there would be no violations in running a proprietary binary on it, right?
[22:56:55] <lispmacs[work]> rber: that is correct
[22:57:04] <lispmacs[work]> though not what the OP was asking
[22:57:26] <rber> yes
[22:58:40] <lispmacs[work]> I believe you could treat the non-free program as a providing a "standard interface" or a "system library" through the API that the non-free program provides to the free plugin

[22:59:54] <rber> oh wow that last one is right on the mark
[23:00:03] <undeclared> perfect, thanks guys
[23:00:19] <lispmacs[work]> I think this is not a problem unless you are trying to make the free plugin a combined work with the non-free program
[23:00:34] <undeclared> that's exactly it
[23:00:39] <undeclared> not going to do that
[23:00:50] <rber> such as making a bundle and distributing them together right
[23:01:12] <rber> well you usually can't do that anyway with proprietary
[23:02:05] <lispmacs[work]> well, erm, "bundling" might move us into the issue of aggregate works, which is slightly different

[23:03:00] <yrk> also, very important: http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#NoDistributionRequirements

[23:04:49] <yrk> also also, stackexchange is generally speaking a very poor tool, and for licensing it is a disaster. stackexchange doesn't give the right answer, it give the most popular answer. any guess as to the relationship out in the world today between "right" and "popular"?
[23:06:19] <lispmacs[work]> I think you have to dive into the license text to determine precisely what actions would be combining two works. Certainly compiling something into a program and then distributing the program
[23:06:45] <kompowiec2[x]> "right" use logic?

[23:08:50] <lispmacs[work]> the GPL was designed with the idea in mind that you would likely need to replace a non-free system one piece at a time
