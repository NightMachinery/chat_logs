[00:08:37] <ajak> that's the keyboard i've been planning on buying for a long time
[00:08:48] <ajak> .. you know, whenever i get around to spending $350 on a keyboard :)
[00:08:59] <jabberwock> Holy shit that's expensive
[00:09:32] <jabberwock> I think those split keyboards are gimmicks. I want a mechanical keyboard that is quiet like a macbook
[00:09:49] <jabberwock> haven't found it yet. I like the Logitech MX Keys but the keys could be higher
[00:09:51] <ajak> that's the keyboard xah lee uses i think
[00:10:40] <ajak> hm, i always feel slight strain in my wrists because my arms are angled outward from the keyboard and wrists twist to put fingers on home row
[00:10:46] <ajak> so i really want a split keyboard
[00:12:07] <spb> mine is just bulged in the middle rather than split, which does the same job but involves less adjustment when moving to or from a laptop keyboard
[00:17:47] <electr0n> ajak: you and me both. I use a goldtouch at the moment and am quite happy with it.

[10:56:01] <electr0n> I have tried an older model, got it at RePC but it was difficult at best.
[10:57:30] <electr0n> set theme fro
[10:58:07] <electr0n> been doing that lately.
[10:59:07] <electr0n> calmclam_: that thing is 500+ if I am not mistaken.
[11:00:10] <calmclam_> yeah it's up there
[11:00:25] <calmclam_> not sure if that much but near it
[11:01:27] <calmclam_> I'd like to get a soldering iron and stuff and make my own, I think the ergodox-ez has a kit that is much cheaper
[11:02:50] <electr0n> what is having me lean that way is the thumb cluster. I have seen others with it but they are just expensive add-ons on top of an already expensive kb.
[11:03:07] <calmclam_> Yeah I like the idea of the thumb cluster
[11:03:23] <electr0n> I have achieved good results with kmonad so we shall see.
[11:04:17] <electr0n> my goal is to remove the mouse from the workflow but I am still not as efficient as I need to be, so am not quite there.
[11:05:19] <calmclam_> I watched a complaint about the ergodox that the thumb doesn't naturally rest on one of the buttons on the thumb cluster so you get some strain on the thumb from always having to move it, someone came up with a different keyboard layout where the home row us up a row instead that gives better thumb positioning and more accessible thum buttons
[11:07:49] <calmclam_> https://github.com/zenaan/quick-fixes-ftfw/blob/master/keyboard/README-ZenTron.md
[11:09:05] <electr0n> let me check it out.
[11:09:48] <calmclam_> If you look at the ergodox keyboard I guess most people's thumb naturally rests in the gap between the main keyboard and the thumb cluster when using a normal layout

[20:48:27] <euouae> plasticuproject: why is that stupid?
[20:50:19] <flyback> it does sound like hogwash
[20:50:33] <flyback> I have to side with plasticuproject
[20:50:33] <euouae> flyback: why?
[20:50:38] <flyback> just cause
[20:51:19] <flyback> im not a security researcher but I am skeptical when all kinds of claims start coming out
[20:51:40] <euouae> what claims?
[20:51:57] <flyback> "Qrypt has developed the only cryptographic solution capable of securing information indefinitely
[20:52:13] <calmclam> Do they show the proof?
[20:52:18] <euouae> That's just marketing. Right. You need proof
[20:52:25] <flyback> that being said, I am more than happy to be wrong
[20:52:50] <euouae> "Peer reviewed algorithm developed by our world-leading cryptographer Yevgeniy Dodis."
[20:52:53] <calmclam> If they say they have a proof as evidence but don't provide the proof that would be a red flag.
[20:53:03] <euouae> That is a dude in NYU. So...
[20:53:04] <flyback> I think that's all plasticuproject was saying euouae
[20:53:11] <flyback> the marketing made him groan
[20:53:34] <euouae> The marketing is on point though: They're telling you that they have something novel (we're the only ones) and that it is good (forever)
[20:53:58] <euouae> They're tackling cryptography on the quantum level. A lot of current algorithms break down with quantum computers. Too much computational power
[20:54:20] <plasticuproject> I mean, theoretically OTPs with high enough entropy are unbreakable I think. The problem has always been scalability and key distrobution, etc. Which they claim to have figured out in a practical way.
[20:54:27] <euouae> At least that is what I gather. Without looking too much into it, the fact that a NYU professor is on their team is a plus
[20:54:55] <plasticuproject> euouae: I didn't say it was stupid, I said my brain was stupid.
[20:55:23] <euouae> plasticuproject: ooh got it. Sorry
[20:55:39] <calmclam> Magic "quantum safe" random bits "from the cloud" another red flag
[20:56:35] <SymbioticFemale> calmclam: one time someone in this chan said they used to get random data by putting a microphone up to a radio tuned to static
[20:56:36] <ajak> we fixed the buzzword problem with buzzwords!
[20:56:38] <euouae> plasticuproject: I don't see a whitepaper anywhere, but they do have some important partners
[20:56:38] <plasticuproject> Yeah it's the claims and marketing junk that makes me wince.

[20:57:49] <euouae> From the cloud just means they're generated there

[21:40:33] <flyback> have everything at the router blackholes so they worse they can do is surf foxnews, etc
[21:40:52] <flyback> plasticuproject, or flash them with a open source security firmware
[21:41:54] <plasticuproject> :-0
[21:42:32] <flyback> in fact for a while and still going on but some vendors have started to patch
[21:42:45] <flyback> corp very secure networks were getting their asses hacked back to them

[21:47:26] <plasticuproject> "The report noted that Verizon consultants were able to directly communicate with point-of-sale registers and servers from the core network. In one instance, they were able to communicate directly with cash registers in checkout lanes after compromising a deli meat scale located in a different store."
[21:47:28] <shibboleth> and said scale was... networked with upstream access to other subnets?

[21:47:39] <flyback> wow
[21:47:53] <flyback> cash registers should be on their own network anyways
[21:48:00] <flyback> OMG YOU HAD TO SPEND $100 MORE ON A SWITCH
[21:48:01] <flyback> THE HORROR
[21:48:52] <plasticuproject> my question is, why does a meat scale need to be network connected??
[21:49:09] <flyback> mabye inventory
[21:49:24] <plasticuproject> Doing inventory by the slice?

[21:49:41] <flyback> classic blunders
[21:49:42] <flyback> ugh
[21:50:42] <flyback> I still rememeber the tjmaxx hack
[21:51:35] <flyback> when visa and mastercard found out the payment vendor was storing a copy of the database of cc's on their internet facing server (or whoever this was done I can't remember anymore, it' a PCI violentation) they went full NEW YORKER on their ass
[21:51:38] <flyback> FUCK YOU BUDDY!
[21:51:43] <flyback> shitlisted them
[21:51:57] <flyback> it was great to listen to the cc payment processor whine about being put out of business
[21:52:54] <plasticuproject> The sad thing is that chart looks pretty standard for a pentest.
[21:53:47] <plasticuproject> " storing a copy of the database of cc's on their internet facing server" Holy shit.
[21:53:59] <flyback> yeah it was "for testing"
[21:54:17] *** Joins: vinumsv (~vinumsv@223.226.88.224)
[21:54:22] <flyback> mastercard and visa were *NOT* amused
[21:55:02] <flyback> that's like near the top of the list of PCI requirements from what I understand
[21:55:07] <bubbajbubba> flyback: Instead of setting up a second router for IoT stuff what I did was set my fortigate into VDOMs, One for family, one for IoT and one for work. Does the job perfectly with no additional hardware (with the exception of the APs - switch I have supports VLANs.)
[21:55:13] <flyback> the web site interface of your site does NOT hold the database
[21:55:28] <flyback> thx bubbajbubba
[21:56:40] <bubbajbubba> That whole attack on Target was just ridiculous. Yet we all know a bunch of others do the same thing and get away with it out of sheer "luck".
[21:57:28] <flyback> In 2007, TJX disclosed that hackers had been inside its network stealing data for at least 18 months before they were discovered. A
[21:57:29] <flyback> fuck me
[21:59:05] <flyback> mabye it wasn't tj maxx
[21:59:29] <flyback> I know there was a payment processor around the same time that got owned because of their database snafu
[21:59:36] <flyback> excuse me for going senile at 47
[22:01:29] <flyback> man I want to play with this new seagate seachest but I don't have any drives from 2016 or newer
[22:01:36] <flyback> they added support for pop/depop
[22:02:06] <flyback> if you have a bad head but the drive is therwise healthy you can disable the head, lose the space from that head but the drive can be reused
[22:02:18] <flyback> so a 2tb would become a 1.5tb on a 2 platter 4 head drive
[22:07:11] <flyback> makes more sense on very large expensive drives
[22:07:21] <flyback> you can refurb and reformat as a smaller but usuable drive
