[11:51:55] <aab_> a weirdo version of windows? what the fuck you working on?
[11:52:01] <csws> 1809 LTSC
[11:52:03] <csws> (at home)
[11:52:07] <csws> but I had other reasons
[11:52:11] <aab_> what reasons
[11:52:13] <csws> mostly performance. it seriously runs so much faster lol
[11:52:14] *** Church is now known as aleph
[11:52:16] <xe0n> 1809 LOL
[11:52:25] <aab_> that's a good reason
[11:52:26] <csws> I wasn't really bothered by candy crush shit as I could always turn it off
[11:52:33] <xe0n> SAC runs fine...
[11:52:34] <csws> also the mellanox NIC only officially has support for 1809
[11:52:39] <xe0n> there you go
[11:52:42] <aab_> the only shit they should be pushing is security fixes
[11:52:44] <csws> tho it did work on newer ones
[11:52:44] <xe0n> running some random server nic card on your desktop pc
[11:52:46] <xe0n> noo shittt
[11:52:48] <csws> lol

[11:55:30] <nobyk> so bear with me
[11:55:46] <aab_> nope csws don't disable defender
[11:55:51] <nobyk> is m.2 the phsyical like.. way of the connection? The piecies that touch?

[11:56:00] <csws> not living on the edge
[11:56:01] <csws> smh
[11:56:13] <csws> nobyk: m.2 is the form factor yeah
[11:56:28] <nobyk> and nvme and sata are the, what I would call 'Interface' and make sure the touching pieces work
[11:56:31] <aab_> if i wanted to live on the edge i would have jumped off ages ago with the amount of shit that living on the edge comes with
[11:56:40] <aab_> you litterally get splatted full of shit every day living on the edge
[11:56:41] <csws> it's the communication
[11:56:49] <aab_> too much bullshit
[11:57:06] <csws> idk i'm fine
[11:57:09] <nobyk> like.. udp and tcp as in, different ways to 'communicate'
[11:57:17] <csws> ehh
[11:57:27] <csws> I think more like how fibre can carry ethernet frames and so can copper
[11:57:52] <nobyk> oh, cool
[11:58:07] <nobyk> okay so then, what's up with the notch? like one has one notch and the other two
[11:58:26] <csws> M key and B key
[11:58:26] <aab_> "With the Semi-Annual Channel, devices receive two feature updates per year, and benefit from the best performance, user experience, security, and stability."
[11:58:29] <csws> I think there's another key too
[11:58:30] <aab_> that will do me
[11:58:59] <csws> it's because some m.2 slots will only do SATA, so it's keyed to stop you from putting an NVMe device into it
[11:59:38] <csws> nobyk: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:M2_Edge_Connector_Keying.svg
[12:00:11] <csws> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M.2#Form_factors_and_keying for the actual key table
[12:00:35] <nobyk> and is it possible for a slot to only do nvme?
[12:01:01] <csws> hmmmmm
[12:01:11] <csws> I think there are some adapters that plug into PCI-E and give you m.2
[12:01:19] <csws> they'd be nvme only I reckon
[12:01:26] <csws> but mobo ones are almost always both or just sata
[12:04:52] <nobyk> Because I have like a usb to m.2 thing
[12:05:17] <nobyk> but the one with two 'keys' never work in that for some reason
[12:06:25] <nobyk> wait
[12:06:25] <nobyk> see

[12:06:36] <nobyk> that's what I meant
[12:06:55] <nobyk> double notch = sata
[12:07:01] <csws> yeah I guess it doesn't have a sata chipset
[12:07:07] <nobyk> But I suppose they're not really directly related

[17:19:18] <riff-IRC> this time, the rotor was around 11K RPM, which was beyond the absolute max rotor speed to 10,575RPM
[17:20:09] <sd> 11<H​otmess> got to love 50hz power only needing 3000rpm
[17:20:39] <riff-IRC> so the structural tolerances of the rotor were violated, so we shot out the cutouts providing power to the site (in case a rotor in self-destruct took out electrical infrastructure) and waited for it to explode
[17:21:14] <riff-IRC> got back about 3 miles and waited for the signature BOOM of a runaway diesel coming to a fast and sudden halt
[17:22:37] <riff-IRC> which it did, about an hour later when it ran itself out of oil and kept on running
[17:23:30] <riff-IRC> blew the side off of the outbuilding and burned it down, as well as sending a chunk of the rotor into the ground
[17:23:49] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> I wonder why we settled on 60 Hz anyways. Anyone willing to give me the history?

[23:29:32] <sd> 03<C​ory San> I'm not sure what to do
[23:30:21] <sd> 03<C​ory San> The sub command generates and returns a string of options I need, but they dont get use properly in the command that uses it
[23:32:04] <sd> 03<C​ory San> This is a sample:
[23:32:07] <sd> 03<C​ory San> ```
[23:32:07] <sd> 03<C​ory San> #!/bin/bash
[23:32:07] <sd> 03<C​ory San> 
[23:32:07] <sd> 03<C​ory San> TBL=example
[23:32:07] <sd> 03<C​ory San> 
[23:32:07] <sd> 03<C​ory San> mysql -u${USR} -h${HOST} $(php params.php ${TBL}) dbname tblname > result.sql
[23:32:11] <xythrez> Can you add exec in front of mysqldump?
[23:32:23] <curdlesnoot> that's petty nasty. you're essentially generating shell syntax. you can't just manifest it with a command susbtitution and expect it to work right. so, you could use eval, though it opens up the prospect of code injection: eval "mysqldump $(php params.php) dbname table"

[23:32:59] <xythrez> Yeah. I'm thinking this is a dirty fix
[23:33:09] <sd> 03<C​ory San> I prefer doing it right, but not sure how
[23:33:18] <curdlesnoot> my advice would be to instead have your php produce the arguments with a delimiter, and without any shell bits. then it would be easy to map them into a bash array.
[23:33:32] <vinrock> i have informer by snow stuck in my head
[23:33:33] <vinrock> wtf
[23:34:00] <sd> 03<C​ory San> Can you elaborate please?
[23:34:17] <xythrez> Does mysqldump support -- ?
[23:34:31] <curdlesnoot> won't help.
[23:34:47] <sd> 08<c​ritamine> How to make lots of monies?
[23:34:47] <sd> 03<C​ory San> A simple example?
[23:35:04] <curdlesnoot> what's the convention for addressing people through this sd thingy?
[23:35:37] <sd> 03<C​ory San> Delimiter instead of space? WOuld quotes inside each option still be OK?
[23:36:20] <sd> 03<C​ory San> So if right now php returns `--no-data --where="id in(1,2,3)"`
[23:36:27] <curdlesnoot> I'll explain.
[23:36:31] <sd> 03<C​ory San> It would return `--no-data|--where="id in(1,2,3)"`
[23:38:41] <curdlesnoot> let's say you adjust your php program to effectively do: echo "--nodata\n--where=id in (1,2,3)\n"
[23:39:08] <curdlesnoot> note the absence of the double quotes in the output. that's very important. instead, one argument can be distinguished from another by the newline character as a delimiter.
[23:39:39] <curdlesnoot> now, if you do that, you can then do this in bash: mapfile -t args < <(php yourprog.php); mysqldump "${args[@]}" dbname tblname
[23:39:45] <curdlesnoot> and it will behave as you expect.
[23:40:07] <curdlesnoot> and without running any risk of code injection, I might add.
[23:40:14] <curdlesnoot> (at least, not on the shell side)
[23:41:01] <sd> 03<C​ory San> Do all args have to come from args? What if I want to have some in between?
[23:41:20] <curdlesnoot> no, they don't. you can specify arguments to the left and to the right of that array expansion.
[23:41:30] <curdlesnoot> you must, however, ensure that the array expansion is double quoted as was shown.

[23:41:56] <sd> 03<C​ory San> Ok, I'm going to go give this try, thank you very much!
[23:42:56] <curdlesnoot> the shift here is that php is no longer acting as a shell code generator (which would need eval). instead, you issue the literal arguments, as split by a predetermined delimiter.
[23:43:22] <curdlesnoot> mapfile is a synonym of readarray, which might make more sense to you.
[23:43:37] <sd> 03<C​ory San> Yes, that makes sense

[23:47:21] <CableNinja> anyone super familiar with packer + aws ?
[23:47:49] <curdlesnoot> xythrez: the answer is yes, by the way. usually, -- comes from the program using getopts for argument parsing.
[23:48:19] <curdlesnoot> support for it, I mean.
[23:49:11] <xythrez> I guess im getting a bit rusty with sh. Thanks for the heads up
[23:53:23] <curdlesnoot> yeah, it's not a shell thing. only tangientally (should you elect to use the getopt/getopts utility to perform argument parsing from a shell script).
