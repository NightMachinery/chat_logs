[02:28:40] <wasamasa> > Playfair is no longer used by military forces because of the advent of digital encryption devices. This cipher is now regarded as insecure for any purpose, because modern computers could easily break it within microseconds.
[02:28:55] <wasamasa> may I interest you in modern cryptography instead
[02:29:01] <wasamasa> works with computers
[02:29:21] <sarnold> those are a lot harder to put into newspaper puzzle columns
[02:29:31] <wasamasa> damnit
[02:29:40] <bgs> that'd be fun
[02:29:55] <sarnold> you'd think they'd just stuff rc4 problems in there, that's not soo complicated :)
[02:30:12] <pi0> oh this is a lite intro course
[02:30:33] *** Quits: halosghost (~halosghos@user/halosghost) (Quit: WeeChat 3.4)
[02:31:43] <pi0> but i mangaged to figure it out whooop
[02:31:52] <sarnold> yay :)
[02:31:54] <pi0> it was that whole swap thing that mixed me up
[02:38:00] <pi0> question regarding a term
[02:38:08] <pi0> relatively prime
[02:38:16] <pi0> that is still prime, right?
[02:38:20] <sarnold> no
[02:38:37] <sarnold> 8 and 9 are relatively prime, because they share no prime factors in common, but both are composite
[02:40:14] <pi0> hmm oh boy
[02:40:18] <pi0> https://aggie.io/ubxdaleqv5
[02:40:24] <pi0> this is my example that i am working with
[02:40:41] <pi0> in step 4, e is  suppose to be relatively prime
[02:41:31] *** Quits: VoidSync (~sync@user/voidsync) ()
[02:41:54] <pi0> not exactly sure how to select a relectively prime number 
[02:42:21] <pi0> do we find a relatively prime number using prime roots?
[02:42:24] <sarnold> note that it says "e is relatively prime to .. 160"
[02:42:28] <sarnold> yes
[02:42:47] <sarnold> it's not that the e you're selecting is relatively prime -- it has to be relatively prime with another number
[02:43:21] <sarnold> 160 is probably just a bunch of twos and fives, so something like three, seven, thirteen, etc..
[02:44:37] <pi0> so in this example 7 was relatively prime to 160
[02:44:43] <pi0> but i could of chosen something else?
[02:44:56] <pi0> i gotta figure out how to  determine relatively prime
[02:45:18] <pi0> i recall the prof mentioning this during lecture
[02:46:35] <sarnold> yeah, you probably have a lot of freedom in the 'e' you pick here, it might be worthwhile trying a few different values of e to see what happens

[19:04:47] <Alipha> gevreeen: why do you want more than 6 digits?
[19:05:24] <gevreeen> currently totp is mostly used in 2fa
[19:05:44] <gevreeen> while I'm more interested in making it 1fa
[19:06:55] *** Quits: sobkas (~sobkas@95.175.17.217) (Remote host closed the connection)
[19:06:55] <rqsd> What's wrong with FIDO2/WebAuthn?
[19:07:43] <maroon> does your implementation of totp allow changing digits to be 9?
[19:08:36] *** Joins: sobkas (~sobkas@95.175.17.217)
[19:09:24] <gevreeen> (I was thinking of something alone the lines of hashing the current time and sign it with an rsa key, say)
[19:10:07] <gevreeen> (and then base64 on the result)
[19:12:06] <maroon> TOTP's RFC says it requires using HOTP as a key building block, so technically anything allowed in HOTP *should* be permitted in TOTP too
[19:12:34] <maroon> and note how HOTP allows for 8 alphanumeric (base36) digits: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4226#appendix-E.1
[19:12:57] *** Joins: ioxzev1z (~ioxzev1z@user/ioxzev1z)
[19:14:24] <gevreeen> well, if longer hash string really isn't a problem for me, could this replace username/password login?
[19:14:38] <maroon> all TOTP is doing is doing data=(TIME/timestep), then using as an 8-byte bigendian 64-bit integer, then does HMAC(data=8-byte-time key=your_TOTP_key) and then it modifies the HMAC hash into digits
[19:15:05] <maroon> so if you can get the HMAC directly, you can do whatever you want outside the protocol - which does not say anything about RSA
[19:15:42] <rqsd> (also why are we still doing rsa did nobody invent elliptric curves yet)
[19:15:47] <maroon> it already supplements login - lots of places you need to type in a 6 digit number alongside your userid/pass
[19:16:18] <maroon> and that 6 digit number is... a TOTP token
[19:16:57] <gevreeen> (yes, but what's the blocker of making this "alternative" version of totp the primary 1fa authentication method though?)
[19:17:39] <gevreeen> (other than we have to do it multiple times to compensate timing errors)
[19:17:46] <maroon> which alternative are you referring to?
[19:18:18] *** Quits: sobkas (~sobkas@95.175.17.217) (Remote host closed the connection)
[19:18:22] <gevreeen> or just TOTP in general
[19:18:40] <maroon> many websits already give you a grace period. they calculate the TOTP token for the intervals above/below the current time period, and they'll accept the number from all 3
[19:19:03] *** Joins: sobkas (~sobkas@95.175.17.217)
[19:19:05] <maroon> the problem with doing that, is that you're reducing the bit strength that's already low
[19:19:39] <gevreeen> so the problem is bit strength
[19:19:48] <maroon> a 6 digit number with a 1/million chance of guessing it correctly is log(999999) / log(2) = 20 bits of strength
[19:20:22] <maroon> so if you change your code to a 9 digit number, those 3 extra digits gives an extra 10 bits, so you now have 30 bits (wow)
[19:22:08] *** Quits: sobkas (~sobkas@95.175.17.217) (Remote host closed the connection)
[19:22:34] <maroon> 100% of the test vectors in TOTP's RFC 6238 are for 8 digit numbers, but i dont know of anyone who even supports that, they just use Google Authenticator's dumbed-down 6 digits

[19:24:11] <gevreeen> (anyway, I get it.)
[19:24:36] <maroon> the spec takes the HMAC and cherry-picks a 31-bit bit range from it, so you're not going to get more than 31-bit strength without breaking the spec - are you wanting to have the base64 of the entire hash?

[19:29:14] <gevreeen> the 80-char limit was picked to make it approach 512, while fitting within a std terminal line
[19:29:47] <maroon> once you start allowing parameters to change, you risk problems if you're not careful
[19:30:50] <maroon> for example, if you allow timestep to change from 30 to 31, that might allow Eve to see a handshake done today, and if the key is longterm today, allow her to do a replay handshake ctime*31/30 in the future
[19:31:27] <maroon> so it should be required that each key must be used with only 1 possible timestep
[19:32:16] <maroon> either that, or have the time value instead be floor(ctime/timestep) * timestep, instead of the current floor(ctime/timestep)
[19:33:28] <maroon> if you have 80 chars on a terminal line, does that push the cursor to the next line like it does in a PC?
[19:35:25] <gevreeen> (does the cursor's position have anything of substance to do with this?)
[19:36:27] <maroon> only your mention of it - is the user supposed to be typing in this 80 digit code, or is it being done by their terminal for them?
[19:37:00] <gevreeen> they will execute some code locally, and copy/paste it
[19:37:51] <gevreeen> like what I've been doing for my 2fa's involving totp
[19:38:00] <maroon> if you're going off-spec as it is, i'd also suggest having the code be generated instead using something like HKDF where the time interval is part of the info (aka context)
[19:38:58] <maroon> wikipedia's HKDF page has simple code for it that's easy to follow

[20:14:29] <dude12312414> I think the difference is that the elliptic curve discrete-log problem doesn't have a GNFS-like attack as fast as for the usual discrete-log problem
[20:20:45] <maroon> which they compensate for by using a curve having 5% of the bit length

[23:15:27] <Vyko> Hey guys. I read that a security audit concluded how encFS vaults are not safe for cloud storage because an adversary might be able to decrypt something if he has multiple versions of the files. On the other hand cryFS is very slow for local use if you have a robust directory structure. Is encFS still safe for local, offline use?
