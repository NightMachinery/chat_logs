[00:34:35] <zumba_addict> is this possible? We have a very old docker image that doesn't have any documentation. So I'm thinking of pulling it down to my machine, create a Dockerfile where FROM is the old image. Then add commands in Dockerfile to generate a image then docker push it. Will this work?

[01:06:56] <zumba_addict> cool :)
[01:07:28] <artok> knowing what that old docker image is doing?
[01:07:35] <zumba_addict> We just want to override the /etc/resolv.conf from the old image
[01:07:50] <zumba_addict> maybe even just use -v myetc:/etc will work
[01:08:11] <ada_> why
[01:08:17] <ada_> resolv.conf gets configured in the daemon
[01:08:56] <ada_> like, the docker daemon sets the /etc/resolv.conf file in the container as a mount from the host upon startup

[02:08:27] <lorimark> tabakhase, ada_ thank you
[02:08:55] <ada_> the --user flag can take a username or a uid.  numeric uid is easiest, since if you pass a username, then there has to be an entry in /etc/passwd in the container to match against
[02:09:05] <ada_> if you pass a numeric uid, then the container user is simply mapped to that uid
[02:09:21] <ada_> $(id -u) in the shell will expand to your uid, and -g does the same for your gid

[13:32:01] <pycode1> ok

[13:38:09] <Johnsen> i found this on the googles:  http://geekyplatypus.com/dockerise-your-php-application-with-nginx-and-php7-fpm/   it runs everything in a separate container and uses official images,  may need a bit of work and docker-compose, but it looks like a pretty clean way of doing things,  add mariadb as an additional service in your docker-compose file and you're probably good to go

[14:14:28] <cim> that's a third party feature

[14:39:54] <Johnsen> you don't need code volume in mariadb,   but you may consider mounting - ./mariadb-data:/var/lib/mysql

[14:50:23] <pycode1> for example i see --volume [data]:/var/lib/mysql
[14:50:34] <pycode1> so i suppose i should use "data" name to specify my local folder no?
[14:50:55] <Johnsen> as far as i know if it starts with ./ or / you're mounting a folder on your host to the folder after : in the container, so the part before : can be whatever you want and have access to
[14:51:23] <Johnsen> if you want to use a volume instead of a folder i believe you need to name it without / or ./ so that it's not a path
[14:51:47] *** Joins: foul_owl (~kerry@23.82.193.78)
[14:52:21] <pycode1> ok
[14:53:19] <Johnsen> for the code folder personally i would not use a volume, it's a lot easier to put your app/files in a folder on your host, otherwise you have to copy them inside the volume and whatnot
[14:53:46] <pycode1> yes
[14:53:50] <pycode1> correct ok

[15:44:25] <pycode1> hahhha yeah i found that too :D
[15:45:51] <pycode1> tabakhase, one question how can i login into the mariadb container? 
[15:45:57] <pycode1> now running docker container ls i see
[15:45:58] <pycode1> 1618ad960929   mariadb:10.1   "docker-entrypoint.s…"   8 minutes ago   Up About a minute   3306/tcp                                docker_db_1
[15:46:15] <pycode1> i would like to store a backup there
[15:46:20] <pycode1> i need to import data
[15:46:32] <tabakhase> define "login" - and define "you" - also generally its kind of a "not" ;-)
[15:47:00] <tabakhase> for importing, thoe images already provide a function, you can bindmount(like volume) a sql-dump right into some init-db.d dir
[15:47:34] <tabakhase> also you can run "sidecars" to connect to that db - or use docker exec - many ways to rome :P
[15:48:14] <pycode1> yes i need to import a .sql
[15:48:15] <pycode1> ok
[15:48:47] <tabakhase> (to get the file in with exec you can use stdin/out like "cat file.sql  | docker exec ..." or "docker exec ... > backup.sql" (for exporting)       -- and dont dare anyone to yell useless cat ;D

[15:53:03] <tabakhase> cause while DNS resolution / service discovery only works in "named networks" - a infected container could just hit 172.xy.z.1-255 (or whatever the block is)
[15:54:02] <tabakhase> Tach many things peopel run in docker dont need networking at all, espc when hitting the "using docker as runtime" rather than "runnning your app in docker"-webdev corner ;-)
[15:54:24] <tabakhase> like when i run JQ or there like on some sensitive json, that need no network
[15:56:28] <Aavar> When you (I) create my own docker container. Is it normal/nessesary to host it on docker hub?
[15:56:38] <tabakhase> Aavar absolutely not 
[15:57:15] <Aavar> tabakhase: how is it saved or whatever? Is it just a file with instructions?
[15:57:21] <tabakhase> local images, storing as tar´s (docker save/load) or using any other registry (from your oneshot-docker-run command in LAN to some embedded in GPC or gitlab or there like - whatever youd need :P
[15:57:53] <tabakhase> unless you do either of those, its just a bunch of jsons and dirs deep inside /var/lib/docker :D
[15:58:03] <Aavar> ok, tnx. I just wondered. Have not read anything about it :)

[17:22:40] <geirha> pycode1: I believe it only runs the scripts you put in /docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/ if the database hasn't already been created
[17:23:12] <geirha> so you may need to remove the volumes it uses to store the database in first
[17:25:02] <pycode1> geirha, hmm if i remove when i use down i will remove that data i suppose
[17:25:03] <pycode1> no?
[17:25:26] <geirha> may need   docker-compose down -v
[17:25:48] <pycode1> does it hold the previous volumes?

[17:27:18] <pycode1> i tried with https://bpa.st/CFLA#1L27

[17:27:22] <pycode1> but it seems not correct
[17:27:35] <pycode1> the empty databaes yes
[17:27:38] <pycode1> i think yes
[17:27:40] <geirha> docker-compose down won't touch that, with or without -v. You'll have to remove the files yourself from /home/damiano/mariadb/
[17:27:55] <pycode1> ok
[17:28:06] <geirha> or, while testing, just comment out that line
[17:28:32] <geirha> then it will generate an unnamed volume to store the data in, which will be removed by docker-compose down

[18:05:27] <tabakhase> (guess with "bindmounting" for dev is a little of an exception, as mounting this to both containers is no big deal - but if you want to prouce an actual app-image in the end its a dirty mess... - cause now you need to not put the files where they shall be, but "some other dir" and now you have to write a entrypoint script that takes care of "updating the volume files with the new sourcecode" 
[18:05:28] <pycode1> tabakhase, i really do not know the reason but i always thought that docker was a kind of virtualmachine and then i also thought that running different cointaners was heavy :F ahaha..
[18:05:28] <tabakhase> ((as otherwise, the volume will just keep reusing all your files from the very first time it was started :P))
[18:06:21] <pycode1> ok
[18:06:29] <tabakhase> pycode1 its "the opposite" rly - especially NOT a virtualMachine as the kernel is shared, and all that docker does is string up a few fences (and its not even docker doing that, but cgroups)
[18:08:34] <pycode1> tabakhase, maybe because docker allows different OS so for that reason i thought about virtual machines... idk :D
[18:08:59] <pycode1> tabakhase, i have to read about that but how can i run a different OS on a docker cointainer sharing the same KERNEL ?
[18:09:00] <tabakhase> OS in docker are just a lie... they are just abused so YOU can use apt/apk/yum/rpm or whatever
[18:09:12] <tabakhase> the whole os, is all just dead-files-on-disk
[18:09:59] <pycode1> aah ok
[18:10:10] <pycode1> so for package managers
[18:10:11] <pycode1> ok
[18:13:36] <tabakhase> and like, "if you know what your process need" you dont need to kep those with you --- "you cant delete in docker", so rm doesnt help -- but you could have a multistage build (two FROMs in one dockerfile) and copy ONLY what you need from one to antoher - gets rly simple with say, static compiled golang - but one could "technicall" pick out of /lib from the first container "Only whats needed" 
[18:13:36] <tabakhase> - but this kinda isnt worth it ((as even 50 images "you build from debian", your disk will still have "debian" just ONCE))

[18:14:32] <pycode1> :)

[18:20:31] <pycode1> i need to start reading the doc deeply instead of trying random commands, i think docker will help me in different ways
[18:20:49] <pycode1> and then now i am running it locally so i can do bad things as well :D
[18:25:43] <leitz> pycode1, a lot of your first learning will be those random commands, just to see what docker can do. Once you have a mental structure, you can add bits of knowledge by planned study.
[18:26:09] <Johnsen> trying out things will teach you a lot, and is pretty fun if you like geeking, also googling when the official docks seem confusing
[18:26:55] <pycode1> thank you very much
[18:27:52] <pycode1> i was thinking to buy an old vps to install very old OS and very olds packages versions but i remembered there was Docker :D ahah 
[18:28:03] <pycode1> yeah i start liking it
[18:29:08] <Johnsen> same, i'm usually not very open for change, i shoved things in VMs, but on a quiet friday evening decided to give docker a try, first avoiding docker-compose too
[18:30:36] <pycode1> docker-compose seems good i basically know nothing about docker but i was able to start php (with the extensions i need) nginx with a custom config.... mariadb, the same with a restore of the data
[18:30:53] <pycode1> in 1 hour i have the same things i have in that old server, sounds awesome to me
[18:30:59] <pycode1> (via docker-compose)
[18:32:04] <leitz> I would be using docker-compose for the FastAPI class i'm taking, but the OS has an issue. Should be fixed in a day or so.
[18:40:54] <pycode1> leitz, fastapi is a very cool library i am using django for all my projects but i should give fastapi i try 
[18:41:13] <pycode1> for the moment i do not like the schema/model duplication for pydantic and sqlalchemy
[18:41:25] <pycode1> but i read the author created sqlmodel if i remember the name correctly
[18:41:30] <pycode1> to avoid that duplication
[18:41:36] <leitz> pycode1, I'm more into backend stuff, so will likely use FastAPI for queries and Nginx for plan web stuff.
