[02:37:15] <bblinky> Hello people, appologies for asking this in here since it's completely on topic but people where not exactly helpfull in #linux..
[02:39:03] <bblinky> So I have just bought a dedicated kimsufi server and need to install an os on it that is not in their drop down menu.. The challenge lies in the fact that it's fitted with an Intel Atom n2800 processor that  does not support vx-t so i can't install by kvm method... Any suggestions on how i can proceed?

[02:42:46] <kevr> Let me get this right: you're trying to install a child machine on there that's running arch linux in some way, but not on the hardware itself?

[02:44:27] <coruja> bblinky: have you tried asking your server provider for support? i think that would be the first who should be asked in your case (meaning live support or support by docs, faqs, forums etc)
[02:44:37] <bblinky> It's not arch, it's actually a debian spin off (univention) I just got tired of peoples smuck way of giving feedback in #linux
[02:45:01] <thrice> and you came here, with a non-arch question? :D :D
[02:45:07] <kevr> bblinky: I think you answered your own question, though.

[02:45:37] <thrice> actually, he said "completely on topic"
[02:45:53] <kevr> Oh. He did.. I'm sorry.
[02:46:20] <Jiogen> create a ramdisk, systemctl switch-root to the ramdisk un-mount the boot drive and install like that following the archinstall guide
[02:46:22] <bblinky> thrice: they where that bad in #linux today
[02:47:01] <kevr> bblinky: If the dedicated server company can't assist you, you might want to go to another provider.

[02:47:57] <drocan> $5/mo isn't affordable it's baseline
[02:48:09] <bblinky> susi: more like an understement ;p
[02:48:09] <kevr> $5/mo is dumpster prices for a server
[02:48:14] <kevr> for a dedicated, that is
[02:48:22] <Jiogen> take that money and go to linode
[02:48:26] <kevr> $5/mo is baseline for a VPS. Not a dedicated.
[02:48:30] <susi> bblinky: you really meant it's "completely ON topic"
[02:48:33] <Jiogen> or buy a raspberry pi
[02:48:38] <archdemon> is snapper something you should use if you use btrfs
[02:48:41] <bblinky> susi: lol
[02:48:49] <Jiogen> everyone should use btrfs
[02:48:49] <coruja> bblinky: #debian doesn't like support questions on derivates/spin-offs either, just telling you in advance
[02:48:50] <susi> bblinky: did you? I need to know :)

[02:49:49] <susi> bblinky: ok, good
[02:49:58] <susi> se ho actually meant to apologize for it being "completely off-topic"
[02:50:06] <thrice> you probably won't have a great time in #debian if it's some spinoff, fwiw

[02:51:58] <bblinky> maybe i should look in to this linode thing that got mentioned earlier#
[02:52:32] <Jiogen> bblinky: Ayem operfect
[02:52:36] <kevr> bblinky: Ah, I see. Yeah... you're probably going to require that they spin up an instance for you, unless they have a custom install option.
[02:52:50] <kevr> they're*
[02:53:12] <Jiogen> bblinky: I told you whaqt your option is in this situation, 1. go to linode or 2, create a ramdisk then switch root to that and install on the boot disk
[02:53:13] <bblinky> kevr: i could also have chosen a server that has a better cpu, I'm just cheap because it's for a newly founded association and i'm a bit broke this month and paying it from my own pocket so far

[02:54:33] <kevr> I think a VPS is really what you want.
[02:54:40] <kevr> You're going to get more affordable prices and more options.
[02:54:43] <bblinky> And last time i had a kimsufi they had an option for custom os
[02:55:10] <kevr> Dedicateds will give you more options overall, but that's if it's a true dedicated, which doesn't seem like kimsufi is
[02:55:26] <coruja> bblinky: maybe rethink choices and offers again for a short while and look for a provider who serves your needs best
[02:55:29] <kevr> they sound like they're selling big VPS machines as dedicateds.
[02:55:48] <bblinky> probably
[02:55:56] <kevr> Go with linode, homie.

[05:25:51] <Edu4rdSHL> archdemon, well, it's the opposite, by default my CPU can run up to 4.7 GHz, I don't want it, I just want an static frequency wioth low temps, low noise, etc

[05:29:40] <kevr> The truth is that it's a different type of scaling than c-states; it depends on your hardware.
[05:29:48] <james447> I installed Arch on a Acer A51 laptop. In bootable ISO the wifi was working, but after installation the wifi is not working at all. Its detecting the hardware but the interface wlp2s0 is not getting UP

[05:30:33] <rcf> Edu4rdSHL: but as a more general answer as to why the kernel seems to disregard the BIOS is... the BIOS is horrible and the kernel wants as little to do with it as possible, because the kernel really has a much, much better understanding of the hardware. For the extreme example, consider graphics drivers: honoring the BIOS APIs strictly means no acceleration by default even if the kernel modules
[05:30:36] <rcf> know how to enable it.
[05:31:53] <Edu4rdSHL> rcf, makes sense. Anyways setting the governor to performance it works as expected.

[05:43:44] <thurstylark> kevr: people can treat their hardware however they want, I give 0 fucks about that. My point is that I consider it irresponsible for me to partake in that kind of exchange and walk away from it with the assumption that I have improved their situation, so I ask for a wider context to be sure. If that context is being withheld, there's no way to know if the answer to their question can be informed

You can always tweak the min_freq of a scaling governor if it clocks

[06:43:08] <obby> virtual machines are the worst
[06:43:15] <MacGyver> james447: I only see one MAC address assignment, done by networkmanager, probably because networkmanager is configured to set that MAC address for that interface.
[06:44:25] <MacGyver> Also networkmanager seems to think that that interface should be disabled, so you may want to check whether it actually *is* set to disabled in NM's config.
[06:44:47] <MacGyver> conr: Do you need connectivity between the VM and the host system?
[06:45:52] <MacGyver> conr: If not, and the host system's network interface is wired, you can see if you have more success with a macvtap attached to that interface.

[07:33:14] <thurstylark> well, the thing about macvtap is that it *might* work, but that's dependant on whether your network hardware supports a somewhat esoteric feature. more discussion here: https://virt.kernelnewbies.org/MacVTap
[07:33:16] <phrik> Title: MacVTap - Linux Virtualization Wiki (at virt.kernelnewbies.org)
[07:34:01] <thurstylark> specifically the discussion around VEPA mode

[07:35:07] <thurstylark> is it?
[07:35:19] <MacGyver> As long as you can do without networkmanager.
[07:35:31] <MacGyver> Set up a macvlan interface on the host system attached to the physical.
[07:35:38] <MacGyver> Then they're connected.
[07:35:55] <MacGyver> Networkmanager can't handle that last I checked, but it works fine with e.g. systemd-networkd.

[07:36:37] <thurstylark> oh shit, where was macvlan all my life :P
[07:37:43] <conr> right now, i'm happy with it, as long as i can ping each ip over the network.
[07:38:03] <conr> and i can vpn on the host but not the guest. 
[07:39:07] <ectospasm> That was something I wasn't prepared for today, when I rebooted my router into the Arch ISO, all the DHCP leases held on my Debian router disappeared.  Everything (apparently) lost its local LAN IP address.
[07:39:31] <ectospasm> I'm not exactly sure why that happened.
[07:40:08] <ectospasm> I was able to overcome it by configuring a static address on my file server, but losing the IP address in the first place was unexpected.
[07:40:22] <ectospasm> Even affected my laptop

[13:19:58] <jirido> I look at film streams at Primewire.ag, their search interface leaves a lot out. It is quite easy to find the different parameters and use them manually but I wonder if anyone here knows about some search program I can fill in with the base address and all diferent parameters and then use to forward the search query to my browser. I remember there vere a old windows program that vas called torrent 
[13:20:04] <jirido> search that worked a bit like that.

[16:55:54] <famubu> In the zathura pdf viewer, which command is used to scroll the page? I was trying to make duplicate mapping for the functionality of the 'j' key but couldn't figure out the exact command.
[16:55:59] <yamii> Depending on your exact use cases you could do with a Nextcloud instance
[16:56:13] <yourfate> I had nextcloud, but I didn't use 99% of it

[17:52:56] <ectospasm> Edu4rdSHL: are you using a specific terminal emulator?  Can you reproduce it on tty1?
[17:53:50] <Edu4rdSHL> ectospasm, well, in tty1 it doesn't write anything at all, maybe tty doesn't support these characters?
[17:53:51] <ectospasm> I'm sure bash doesn't recognize ‹ and › as < and >, and that's gotta be a problem.
[17:54:06] <Edu4rdSHL> And it's happening in every application...
[17:54:16] <Edu4rdSHL> ectospasm, more than than: programming
[17:54:22] <susi> must be a feature of your term emulator
[17:54:25] <Edu4rdSHL> I do programming 100%  of my time
[17:54:41] <ectospasm> Edu4rdSHL: and bash interpreter is basically a programming environment.
[17:54:42] <Edu4rdSHL> susi, if you aren't going to help, shut up thanks.
[17:54:50] <ectospasm> Edu4rdSHL: what DE do you use?
[17:55:08] <Edu4rdSHL> ectospasm, XFCE, but as I said it seems to be happening in tty as well
[17:55:13] <susi> nah, I'm just too high on weed
[17:55:40] <ectospasm> Edu4rdSHL: that's strange that it's happening in tty.  
[17:55:59] <Edu4rdSHL> Maybe a motherboard update caused it? I update this in the night
[17:56:05] <Edu4rdSHL> Would be fun if that's the problem lol
[17:56:07] <ectospasm> Must be something with the locale and/or keyboard layout.
[17:56:21] <ectospasm> Edu4rdSHL: that seems unlikely.
[17:56:46] <ectospasm> Unless the BIOS/EFI has something about the keyboard.
[17:56:57] <Edu4rdSHL> Well, it was working fine before the update, then I updated, go to sleep, wake up and that happened mmm
[17:57:18] <Edu4rdSHL> And the fact that it's happening on tty confuses me more
[17:57:29] <Edu4rdSHL> I will try a few things
[17:57:48] <ectospasm> Yeah, I'd check the BIOS/EFI for any keyboard related settings.  Maybe it defaulted to something nonstandard.
[17:57:51] <ectospasm> I don
[17:57:59] <ectospasm> I don't know what else it could be.
[17:58:15] <ectospasm> Do you have the previous firmware to flash over it?

[19:05:53] <ectospasm> techvio: depends on your reasoning behind choosing LTS over the standard one.
[19:06:09] <Edu4rdSHL> techvio, it's a good option to stick with, but there is nothing wrong using the mainline one
[19:06:23] <ectospasm> If your main concern is avoiding kernel regressions, then LTS might be a better choice.

[21:05:38] <The-Compiler> mingdao: I don't think the butterfly key does anything by default, but you can map all keys with a GUI tool (or tinker with the firmware directly even)
[21:06:57] <The-Compiler> riv: yeah, almost every split keyboard uses either TRRS (3.5mm audio+mic cable) or RJ45, because it's trivial to get cables in any length for it

[21:18:03] <pulec> I wanna install Linux beside win10 on first notebook for 12y niece, I tried installing arch and somehow and instead of teaching the user rather enabled auto login and sort of 'pacman -Syu' which needs some maintanance (at least pacman -Scc from time to time) or confirmation from time to time

[21:19:12] <pulec> right, Mint or *Ubuntu
[21:19:25] <pulec> I like cinnamon since its similar to windows
[21:19:30] <alad> there's a guy on the wiki who tried to get autoupdate working on arch
[21:19:42] <pulec> and no matter what niece is gonna be forced to be on windows and use some ms office shit

[21:20:43] <pulec> I might think of Ubuntu and just installing Cinnamon
[21:21:05] <pulec> but I have some bad experience around 2013 or so when I was just switching to arch on desktop pc
[21:21:19] <pulec> and ubuntu just plainly borked it's grub during regular update
[21:21:44] <pulec> had no idea how to debug or fix it back then, so I formated drive and installed arch

[22:03:55] <ectospasm> astrid_: do you need lib32-libcap?  You probably have some package that depends on that 32bit library, and pacman wants to upgrade libcap.
[22:04:10] <astrid_> I don't need it specifically but it seems part of a large dependency tree
[22:04:12] <mongy> archweb states lib32-libcap depends on libcap=2.59 
[22:04:26] <mongy> your mirror might need to catch up...
[22:04:33] <astrid_> huh, maybe.
[22:04:55] <astrid_> I just removed that and a bunch of other packages (seems like the root of that tree is steam-native-runtime which i don't need)

[22:48:14] <CyberShadow> I think bash does have a "safe subset" though using it is kind of onerous and we don't have good tools to facilitate it (shellcheck helps a lot but still leaves many issues open)
[22:48:39] <CyberShadow> But in general I would recommend using errexit for everything non-trivial
[22:49:18] <alad> if you limit yourself to using bash as a command-language and not a pseudo-perl, then things are looking better
[22:49:37] <alad> makepkg & co go with the pseudo-perl approach
[22:49:55] <CyberShadow> Yes but that precludes automating anything, as using it as a command-language implies having a user inspect the result of every command

[22:51:04] <CyberShadow> Errexit bugs are rather annoying to debug, especially for users (scripts will often just silently exit with no clue of what failed), but the consequences of non-errexit bugs can be much more disastrous, so I'm in the errexit camp :P
[22:51:22] <alad> if you're going to write your bash script as a simple list of commands, set -e is probably good enough
[22:51:48] <alad> if you're going to pipe 3408 commands together with complex control flow, then it will likely bite you in the rear instead

[22:52:47] <CyberShadow> If you're going to pipe 3408 commands together, then you especially need errexit, because otherwise if one of those commands fails, you will want the entire thing to fail rather than continue doing something completely different from what you expected

[22:56:15] <CyberShadow> The most prominent annoyance is grep, which returns 1 when it finds no results (similarly to checkupdates here)

[22:56:59] <CyberShadow> You can also cause SIGPIPE in other applications with grep -q
[22:57:23] <CyberShadow> But all of these are peanuts compared to what could happen if some arbitrary step in the script just got silently skipped due to some random error
[22:58:01] <CyberShadow> Visual Basic has this thing called "ON ERROR RESUME NEXT", which means, ignore all errors and continue going. Of course, it is considered a horrible anti-pattern. But, it's the default in shell scripts, and lots of people actually think it's a good idea :)

[23:10:41] <BrainDamage> I wonder if it'd make sense to be able to dl a snapshot of aur's srcinfo as a db so one can search it locally much like pacman
[23:11:41] <CyberShadow> As I understand, AUR is all in one big git repository. Each package is a branch.

[23:12:26] <alad> WUFF
[23:12:54] <alad> indeed, if one would have the ability to clone aur.git, making a db from it would be fairly straightforward
[23:13:00] <alad> that includes a pacman db
