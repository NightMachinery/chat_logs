[02:03:44] <OnlineCop> .NET supports `(...)+` as each new one pushes onto a stack. PCRE, however, just clobbers the old value.
[02:04:32] <OnlineCop> So you'd need to have multiple [optional] capture groups so new ones won't overwrite what was already stored under that specific capture index.
[02:04:48] <jargon> So how would I do this?

[02:05:32] <OnlineCop> https://regex101.com/r/Y4sUG7/4
[02:06:14] <OnlineCop> It would probably be safer to just match everything, and then split them up programmatically.

[12:03:56] <maroon> the problem isnt substitution, it's understanding the words of what they're wanting and not wanting
[12:04:47] <maroon> like in algebra, working the x/y formula was the easy part, the hard part was understanding the word problem to figure out what formula to use
[12:05:15] <DynV> The only important thing is the input in https://regex101.com/r/3VZ4TQ/1 My explanations are only my interpretation of it.
[12:06:09] <DynV> If you see another pattern that could remove the games not on rebate, that would be fine too.
[12:06:36] <maroon> DynV, also to be clear, are you wanting to match what you DONT want to keep so you can replace it with NUL, or you want to match what you DO want to keep?
[12:06:56] <arash> maroon, i think that part is clear, they want aaa bbb and aaaaa or aaaa should convert to aaa i guess, then again aaaaaa is two match aaa and aaa
[12:07:09] <DynV> the 1st part, replacing with \null what I don'T want.
[12:08:41] <arash> maroon, can you help me with substation part? so i can try it
[12:09:43] <maroon> just like i did in the url i gave you, click on the substitution link, and it opens a box to put the replacement
[12:12:17] <arash> maroon, i guess it should be a regex and not a letter, https://regex101.com/r/yRO2bL/1
[12:12:38] <arash> it didn't get fixed that way.
[12:14:52] <arash> is it possible to use a regex in substitution part?

[13:15:52] <DynV> So if I remember to now on not include the standalone 0 before the 1st "block", V4 is more performant, but if there's a chance I forget to remove it V5 will removed the top standalone 0, and that if I still choose V4, the only consequence of me still including the top standalone 0, is that it will be included in the output?

[13:19:59] <DynV> V5 has a big problem. it removes things beyond the last %; I need for the whole "block" to be in the output. I think I'll just go with V4.
[13:21:15] <DynV> I'll assume the answer with "if I still choose V4, the only consequence of me still including the top standalone 0, is that it will be included in the output?" is yes.

[13:22:05] <digitok> the goal is just to keep the first 3 blocks in v1?
[13:22:33] <DynV> it's to filter out the "blocks" of the games not on rebate.
[13:22:46] <digitok> that doesn't answer my question

[13:23:36] <DynV> the ones on rebate could be scrambled.
[13:23:53] <digitok> can you remove the 0 crap later
[13:24:02] <digitok> or does this need to do that too
[13:24:21] <digitok> specifically the ones between the stuff we're keeping
[13:25:09] <digitok> 07maroon, isn't it remove any block NOT containing %?
[13:25:09] <DynV> keeping the standalone 0 or removing wouldn't affect the reading.
[13:25:29] <maroon> correct, killing blocks not having a %
[13:25:31] <DynV> so either would be fine.
[13:25:38] <digitok> https://regex101.com/r/3VZ4TQ/6
[13:26:53] <DynV> provided that works for cases in which the games on rebate aren't only the 1st 3, thanks!
[13:27:08] <digitok> yw
[13:28:11] <DynV> I just tested that, and it does work.
[13:28:48] <digitok> note this starts matching from any line starting with 0
[13:29:04] <digitok> you can add $ or \n after ^0 if you want to prevent that
[13:29:24] <DynV> standalone 0s should always be included for every games‡.

[13:57:27] <DynV> I was cleaning up the chat for my log and noticed "<DynV> it takes a lot more steps", and I realized that was because I looked at the step count of the version I tested from the "scrambled" rebates (indeed negligible difference).

[15:51:56] <re101-goat-11> Hey! I'm running Regex in BigQuery and was using a ?= as a part of my expression, which seemingly BQ doesn't handle, throwing me a "Cannot parse regular expression: invalid perl operator: (?="-error. Any guidance on how I can re-write it to be the perl equivalent?
[15:55:55] <digitok> ?= is valid in perl
[15:56:20] <digitok> i think the error is saying you're using a perl operator, which is invalid. just worded badly
[15:56:26] <digitok> seems bigquery uses google's re2 regex
[15:57:45] <re101-goat-11> Oh okay, that's weird. Excuse my ignorance but what could the issue be then? If I simply drop the (?= part, it runs just fine, so there seems to be something around that one.
[15:58:57] <digitok> i'd need to see the regex to say

[16:02:30] <re101-goat-11> Of course, here's an example: https://regex101.com/r/wNNEU5/1/
[16:03:05] <re101-goat-11> I basically want it to output the same for both variations of the string. Preferably get rid of the : or / in-between too.
[16:03:30] <re101-goat-11> Dropped the old expression now in favor of the current, but this one doesn't drop the ? in the end of the URL as I want it to
[16:04:02] <digitok> and you're using it in a replacement?
[16:04:08] <re101-goat-11> end goal is that both strings will be returned as abca1B2c3
[16:04:30] <re101-goat-11> Sorry, not sure what you mean by replacement there?
[16:04:58] <digitok> which regex function are you using currently
[16:05:15] <digitok> extract or replace
[16:05:25] <re101-goat-11> Ah, REGEXP_EXTRACT
[16:05:53] <re101-goat-11> Did manage to do an extract of multiple groups only to realize BQ only handles 1 group
[16:06:00] <digitok> ok, well there's no way for that to be returned as a match since regex will only return a contiguous
[16:06:07] <digitok> correct, you'd need multiple groups
[16:06:33] <digitok> so the best you could do is a replacement to remove the parts you don't want
[16:07:06] <digitok> a contiguous string*
[16:07:37] <re101-goat-11> aah
[16:08:01] <digitok> also fyi the golang flavour on re101 is re2
[16:08:37] <re101-goat-11> Got it. Really appreciate the help. Thanks a lot!
[16:09:11] <digitok> np, so with your regex
[16:09:36] <digitok> what's .*?[^:\/] intended to do
[16:09:53] <digitok> match anything that isn't : or \/ ?
[16:10:42] <digitok> i assume the group at the end is where the lookahead was being used, (?=\?|$)
[16:10:53] <digitok> to ensure that what comes next is either ? or the end of the string
[16:12:05] <digitok> ah i think that was intended to remove the : or /
[16:12:15] <re101-goat-11> So, just to be clear, I'm a total regex noob so can't argue too much about some choices made (heh). But I was imagining the [^\/:] would not capture / or :
[16:12:18] <re101-goat-11> exactly

[19:49:58] <simcop2387> strange, a local connection failed
[19:50:34] <simcop2387> beats me
[19:51:09] <Me-me> Why is it using sockets if it's local
[19:51:18] <Me-me> Or am I misunderstanding sockets
[19:53:08] <digitok> is there a reason it's kinda slow
[19:54:27] <yitz> Because sockets are the standard
[19:55:00] <Me-me> I need to learn how they work at some point.
[20:00:05] <JohnDoe2> generally you just pick up a cord, and plug it in a socket. Then when done, you unplug it.
[20:00:23] <Me-me> Damn I was leaving it in, thanks for the hot tip.
[20:00:51] <JohnDoe2> yes, my ex taught me that one

[20:01:03] <JohnDoe2> I used to leave it in as well but apparently "that doesn't do anything"

[20:10:43] <arash> How can i match 2332 in this string https://regex101.com/r/CbGLfF/1
[20:23:45] <OnlineCop> arash: Assuming the string is literally `234434******2332` then that will match it correctly.

[20:24:40] *** Sevalecan is now known as SevalecanLord
[20:24:55] <OnlineCop> If you're trying to match it in some text that contains a double quote after it, then you will want to change the '$' (end of line) to perhaps '"' (a double quote) or group some various alternatives: `(?:$|")` or `(?=$|")`
