[05:22:40] <guifa> codesections: and updated to fix a few things
[05:27:19] <RaycatWhoDat> guifa, not exactly. I mean, capturing everything that part of the match into a variable named such
[05:28:30] <RaycatWhoDat> https://github.com/RayMPerry/kitchen-sink/blob/master/txr/csv-parse.txr
[05:29:27] <RaycatWhoDat> So, on line 4, given a line of a CSV file, it will take the longest match of characters and bind it to `first_name` to be used later
[05:30:05] <RaycatWhoDat> So, I was wondering if there was anything that could do that. If there isn't, how hard would it be to implement?
[05:31:16] <guifa> If you need to use it in the regex itself, not too bad: 
[05:31:26] <guifa> m: 'abcdefc' ~~ / $<foo>='c' .*? $<foo> /; say $/

[06:16:26] <codesections> guifa: that seems like an excellent example of why &[eqv] shouldn't work that way.  
[06:16:46] <guifa> ah but where it gets more interesting is

[06:46:16] <guifa> ^^ why I think .fmt("%m/%d%Y" would be better ;-)
[06:51:46] <codesections> Fair.  Though, bikeshedding a bit, I wonder if it should be .date-fmt or something and also exposed as a sub. e.g., multi date-fmt(Str $fmt, Date $date) {...}; multi date-fmt(Str $fmt, Str $date-str) {...}
[06:52:56] <codesections> then you could do something like date-fmt("%m/%d/%Y", '2021-07-17')
[06:53:37] <codesections> (and that would avoid confusion with the other .fmt methods, which all use printf fmt string)

[08:54:04] <moon-child> vrurg: in https://vrurg.github.io/arfb-publication/02-everything-is-an-object-mop/, the way you describe integers as working in raku actually predates c++ by at least a decade, having first appeared in smalltalk and lisp.  (And actually raku's 'meta object protocol' is taken from common lisp.)  And the way you describe integers as working in c++ comes from simula, which originated in the early 1960s.
[08:54:06] <moon-child>  I think it would be better to change the c++ reference to simula (with maybe a reference to c++, since people may not be familiar with simula), and mention the common lisp influence

[19:33:56] <Altreus> gfldex: Many classes that are typically represented as a Str  ... I take from your example you mean in the sense that a Channel is usually represented as its name?
[19:34:08] <Altreus> a user is represented as @user#1234
[19:34:11] <Altreus> etc
[19:34:23] <[Coke]> codesections: there's probabaly already a ticket for mis-categorized things in general, but having a specific one to fix isn't a bad thing.
[19:35:37] <Altreus> gfldex: I don't mind adding methods that return the string you would use to represent the thing in a message
[19:35:43] <Altreus> That might not be a terrible idea
