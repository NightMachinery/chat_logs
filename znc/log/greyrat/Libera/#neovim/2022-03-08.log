[06:39:07] <wroathe> So this script just sets both + and * to use the same utility (pbcopy) to copy to it

[13:12:25] <gravndal> kenaryn: that (the dot) is the character used for string concatenation in vimscript, see :h expr6
[13:12:57] <gravndal> for an introduction to vimscript you probably want to read section 41 of the user manual (not the reference manual) :h user_41.txt

[13:13:27] <gravndal> and?

[13:16:37] <gravndal> to reiterate: I really would recommend that you have a look :h usr_41.txt

[13:21:31] <kenaryn> It seems incredibly difficult to prepare nvim for python3, there are a lot of noise due to outdated tutorials.
[13:22:52] <gravndal> when you say "configure nvim with python3" do you mean having a functional python provider (:h provider-python), and thus a working :python3 command
[13:23:06] <kenaryn> Yes!

[19:32:21] <gpanders> when you configure via `on_publish_diagnostics` it calls `vim.diagnostic.config()` with the namespace argument set to the client's namespace
[19:32:34] <gpanders> so when `open_float` is called it's possible it's not picking up that configuration

[20:05:56] <hedron[m]> https://github.com/nvim-neorg/neorg#treesitter
[20:05:57] <clason[m]> OK, then that means something in your config is messed up

[20:07:00] <clason[m]> are you _sure_ you have the `nvim-treesitter` plugin installed?
[20:07:19] <hedron[m]> Possible. According to nvim-treesitter, It should work if I add one line of code: https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter#utilities
[20:07:41] <hedron[m]> Though what I need to figure out is how to make it work with other plugins, which in my case is Neorg.
[20:07:52] <clason[m]> Well, if the nvim-treesitter plugin is installed, which is assumed this far down in the Readme...
[20:07:57] <hedron[m]> clason[m]: I can. Syntax highlighting and parsers are installed and all the commands provided by `nvim-treesitter`are available
[20:08:20] <hedron[m]> s/can/am/
[20:08:29] <clason[m]> Then `require'nvim-treesitter.ts_utils'` should work. it does for me.
[20:09:06] <hedron[m]> clason[m]: Don't mind If you try to use my configuration and try to open a `.norg` file?
[20:09:14] <clason[m]> I do, sorry.
[20:09:26] <hedron[m]> Oh, nvm.
[20:09:29] <clason[m]> that's too much tooling (the norg parser is troublesome)
[20:09:56] <clason[m]> try to create a minimal config -- only `nvim-treesitter`, nothing else
[20:09:57] <clason[m]> see if it works
[20:10:05] <hedron[m]> So is there an alternative to get `norg` syntax highlighting? As the `ts_utils` not working.
[20:10:07] <hedron[m]> Alright.
[20:10:08] <clason[m]> if it does, slowly add stuff from your actual config until it breaks
[20:10:42] <clason[m]> hedron[m]: I still don't understand that. `ts_utils` contains internal functions that you don't need to touch if you just want syntax highlighting
[20:10:44] <hedron[m]> clason[m]: Alright.
[20:11:10] <clason[m]> if it doesn't, it means your installation of nvim-treesitter is borked ;)
[20:11:18] <sunjonSenghanBri> I think he's seen ts_utils in a neorg error trace, and chased the wrong rabbit
[20:11:18] <hedron[m]> clason[m]: I'm just assuming that is what Treesitter is trying to load from the parsers provided.
[20:11:25] <clason[m]> no

[20:12:39] <hedron[m]> I don't have lazy loading enabled.
[20:12:58] <hedron[m]> And I think you're right about the "chasing the wrong rabbit" part.
[20:13:20] <sunjonSenghanBri> if neorg needs ts_utils, it will do the require'ing part
[20:14:01] <sunjonSenghanBri> so I'm guessing it tried(and failed) and it's core.integration.treesitter or whatever, therefore does't exist
[20:14:04] <clason[m]> yeah. that's what I meant with "error in the plugin"
[20:14:29] <hedron[m]> So, is that something to do with Neorg?
[20:14:57] <clason[m]> the instructions in the neorg readme look correct to me; these should work if `nvim-treesitter` is installed (as a `start` package; otherwise you need to packadd it first)
[20:15:03] <clason[m]> hedron[m]: I have no idea.
[20:15:03] <hedron[m]> As far as I can say, It seems like the concealer module of Neorg is failling trying to index a field that is provided by the `ts_utils` module
[20:15:31] <hedron[m]> clason[m]: treesitter as a packadd?
[20:15:43] <hedron[m]> Isn't it supposed to work if configured like other plugins?
[20:16:21] <clason[m]> nvim-treesitter
[20:16:45] <clason[m]> and, yes, that is just like every other plugin behaves (if you put a package in `opt`, you need to `packadd` it manually)
[20:17:04] <sunjonSenghanBri> https://github.com/nvim-neorg/neorg/tree/main/lua/neorg/modules/core/integrations/treesitter
[20:17:22] <sunjonSenghanBri> that's the `core.integrations.treesitter` that the error references
[20:17:35] <hedron[m]> i haven't put a package in `opt` directory, and the packer installation is done through an AUR package instead of the Neovim configuration.
[20:17:38] <sunjonSenghanBri> you can see where it will load ts_utils at line 20
[20:17:56] <BennyPowers[m]> I want to define an autocmd that fires for every buffer filetype except one in particular. What's the syntax for that?
[20:17:56] <BennyPowers[m]> ```vim
[20:17:56] <BennyPowers[m]> autocmd BufEnter !Regexplainer :Thing
[20:17:56] <BennyPowers[m]> ```
[20:17:59] <clason[m]> hedron[m]: maybe the neorg plugin didn't adapt to an internal change in nvim-treesitter? I have no idea. if nvim-treesitter on its own works (test with a minimal config) for a `norg` file, and you follow the instructions in the Neorg readme exactly and it _doesn't_ work, you should open an issue with their repo

[22:39:15] <clason[m]> This Is The Way.
[22:39:31] <clason[m]> Guest6: why? they can just write their own.
[22:39:44] <sunjonSenghanBri> "..as long as it's black!"
[22:39:54] <clason[m]> and a centralized repository is a gate-keeper and reduces visibility of new plugins (which, as I alluded to, anybody can create)
[22:39:59] <Guest6> hahahah
[22:40:46] <Guest6> just something that points to github repos...
[22:41:04] <clason[m]> like https://vimawesome.com ?

[22:41:35] <kriansa[m]> clason[m]: sorry if I didn't catch your point here, but how a centralized repo _reduces_ visibility of new plugins?
[22:41:49] <clason[m]> (which apparently failed to extend their certificate...)
[22:42:00] <clason[m]> kriansa[m]: by not having them in there?
[22:42:47] <clason[m]> I mean, someone has to curate said repository
[22:43:04] <kriansa[m]> what I mean by centralized would be something like a NPM
[22:43:25] *** Joins: Guest6 (~Guest6@1.47.18.14)
[22:43:27] <clason[m]> yeah, we don't want that
[22:43:32] <mjlbach[m]> The likelihood of someone maintaining a centralized repository over a long term is also essentially nil
[22:43:49] <Guest6> oh my lord LIKE vim awesome
[22:43:56] <clason[m]> it's hard enough to maintain Neovim...
[22:44:20] <Guest6> this site is gorgeous..
[22:44:24] <kriansa[m]> I see, don't worry I'm not complaining, just trying to understand your point
[22:44:45] <kriansa[m]> (yeah it's definitely a burden to maintain an infrastructure for that)
[22:45:00] <Amanda[m]> vimawesome.com's tls certificate is expired, zoop
[22:45:00] <clason[m]> that's putting it very lightly...
[22:45:06] <Guest6> this is exactly what is as looking for...! not sure how i missed this, while wandering github for plugins
[22:45:12] <mjlbach[m]> even the emacs community is arguably moving away from elpa
[22:45:17] <mjlbach[m]> (see the rise/popularity of straight.el)
[22:45:25] <Guest6> yeah lol, took a sec to visit the unsecure site :cry:
[22:45:40] <clason[m]> for Neovim specifically, there is also https://github.com/rockerBOO/awesome-neovim
[22:45:50] <clason[m]> not quite as fancy, but with SSL!
[22:46:00] <Guest6> LOL
[22:47:23] <kriansa[m]> mjlbach[m]: good to know, but yeah pkgs on elpa vs melpa vs marmelade was truly a pain to keep up with
[22:48:44] <Guest6> ahhh thanks @clason[m] ! surely i ran into this before... but maybe was *overwhelmed* haha
[22:49:29] <Guest6> it looks good though! it doesn’t list the older autocomplete plugins i tried ‘n had trouble with
[22:50:12] <clason[m]> yeah, some of the very early plugins are abandoned now and probably (hopefully) removed for that reason.
[22:52:12] <kriansa[m]> <clason[m]> "for Neovim specifically, there..." <- oh that's golden, ty! I'mma need it whenever I feel like upgrading my funcs and packages to lua
[22:53:38] <sunjonSenghanBri> eeeesh, m1 ultra
[22:53:54] <clason[m]> M1 xtreme!
[22:57:04] <Guest6> is it writing a plugin for omnicomplete for a language really complex? or is there like a general tamplate?

[23:04:20] <Guest6> interesting.. yeah i see it, vimtex + a coc plugin
[23:04:46] <clason[m]> no, just vimtex
[23:04:51] <clason[m]> no coc required
[23:05:37] <sunjonSenghanBri> he was just speaking about places he'd found it
[23:05:38] <sunjonSenghanBri> it's in lots of places
[23:06:04] <Guest6> :)
[23:06:05] <sunjonSenghanBri> I used it in frecency, which might be worth a look
[23:06:22] <sunjonSenghanBri> as it's the only part that's not in lua (except the candidate generation)
[23:06:26] <sunjonSenghanBri> https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope-frecency.nvim/blob/master/plugin/frecency.vim
[23:07:09] <Guest6> the coc plugin actually just calls a #deoplete function in vimtex...
[23:08:11] <clason[m]> yeah, there are autocomplete plugins that can trigger omnicomplete based on some conditions
[23:08:32] <clason[m]> you didn't ask about that, though; just how to provide candidates for omnicomplete
[23:08:35] <Guest6> oh wow! well that s not bad 30 lines
[23:08:50] <Guest6> i was expecting *a lot* more
[23:09:27] <sunjonSenghanBri> you're only generating a list for a builtin function to do something with
[23:10:13] <Guest6> write, but doesn’t it have to call that function from like... a compiler... or compiler server or something ?
[23:10:59] <Guest6> right* lol
[23:11:54] <sunjonSenghanBri> nah, you have the source candidates (my_lang_keywords), you build the context yourself (getline('.') etc), filter candidates and return matches
[23:12:50] <Guest6> hmmm.... oh this is for context-based completion?
[23:13:06] <clason[m]> yes
[23:13:10] <Guest6> ahhhh
[23:13:14] <sunjonSenghanBri> yeah, isn't that what you asked about?
[23:13:20] <clason[m]> otherwise completion would be quite boring ;)
[23:13:47] <Guest6> i dunno, i’m in over my head with all of this, i don’t know programming this well
[23:14:15] <Guest6> context..... hmmm... maybe tags?

[23:33:07] <nova> in some channels, there is an irc service functioning as a bot that will kick you. but also lines in irc are rate limited. you see them post all at once, but the server sends the lines at a rate of 2 or 3 per second only
