[00:30:36] <re101-cow-11> hi
[00:30:55] <JohnDoe2> moooo
[00:31:36] <re101-cow-11> I need to place a 100+ redirects from an old URL to new URL
[00:32:01] <re101-cow-11> Can we achieve this adding regex redirect?
[00:32:17] <JohnDoe2> apache?

[00:33:28] <Karthikeyan> What do you mean by apache? Sever?
[00:33:58] <JohnDoe2> yup which web server are you trying this in? or is it in a script?
[00:35:06] <Karthikeyan> Sorry, I'm not aware of the servers.
[00:35:25] <Karthikeyan> Can you tell the ways to this? I can try and let you know if this works.
[00:35:55] <Karthikeyan> The source and destination URLs almost some expect an account id.

[00:39:34] <JohnDoe2> Karthikeyan sorry I'm a bit confused here - do you own the site?
[00:42:28] <Karthikeyan> No, this is for my own knowledge.
[00:43:28] <maroon> how is the regex supposed to know it should change 2543 into 86559?
[00:44:27] <Karthikeyan> I'm not sure that's why I'm asking in this chat.
[00:45:04] <JohnDoe2> ok, well, for your knowledge sites are served by HTTP servers of which arguably the 2 most popular are apache and nginx. They both support rewrite rules using regex. But then there's also the possibility to redirect using scripting languages like php or whatever else is served by those HTTP/web servers
[00:45:21] <JohnDoe2> and ultimately you can do it in HTML/js too which runs on the client's machine
[00:46:09] <JohnDoe2> but this is really just a regex channel so getting help with all of the above is outside its scope

[00:50:34] <Karthikeyan> My connection was lost and not able to connect in the same chat window.
[00:51:03] <Karthikeyan> Sorry about that.
[00:51:15] <Karthikeyan> Can you help me with this redirect?
[00:52:00] <JohnDoe2> you just want a regex to swap the two numbers?
[00:53:07] <maroon> you have a list of from/to number pairs that need a search/replace within the url?
[00:54:15] <Karthikeyan> Yes
[00:54:52] <Karthikeyan> from 2543 to 86559
[00:56:24] <Karthikeyan> I think it can be done by rewrite rule.
[00:58:32] <JohnDoe2> yes it can be but if you don't know what apache is, that's probably going to be a bit of a challenge. The regex we give you won't necessarily be a copy paste over to a rewrite rule
[00:59:13] <maroon> ah, so this is a search-and-replace that applies to all url's where -2543- is found?
[01:00:25] <Karthikeyan> yes
