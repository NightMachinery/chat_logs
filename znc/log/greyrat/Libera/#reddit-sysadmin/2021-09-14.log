[18:37:06] <Hunterkll> hyper-v doesn't have xen-style paravirt though ? 
[18:37:09] <vinrock> but it can run some real wacky shit tho

[18:38:06] <Hunterkll> you mean virtualbox using WHV/hyper-v as the execution platform instead of it's own engine?
[18:38:10] <Hunterkll> that's not paravirt

[18:38:19] <sd> 10<a‚Äãlazare619> read their docs on it
[18:38:30] <Hunterkll> it's literally vbox creating/managing hyper-v VMs / partitions, with vbox providing some hardware emulation
[18:38:35] <Hunterkll> that's the whole point of how WHV works 
[18:39:00] <sd> 10<a‚Äãlazare619> https://docs.oracle.com/en/virtualization/virtualbox/6.0/admin/gimproviders.html
[18:39:05] <yuken> Hunterkll, send me some pepper seeds.
[18:39:07] <sd> 10<a‚Äãlazare619> its paravirtualzation per their docs
[18:39:43] <Hunterkll> paravirtualization is like, providing stub drivers instead of full hardware device emulation, or providing even stub kernel functions instead of full emulation 
[18:39:58] <Hunterkll> Ah, I see the confusion 
[18:40:10] <Hunterkll> You're talking about using Hyper-V's paravirtualized devices inside virtualbox
[18:40:28] <sd> 10<a‚Äãlazare619> yes its not para virtualization in the sense of xen
[18:40:29] <Hunterkll> so you're just using paravirtualized CPU functions   that hyper-v natively offers
[18:40:40] <Hunterkll> the VM is not actually paravirtualized in the sense of being a paravirt VM
[18:40:53] <Hunterkll> it's just select (but not all that hyper-v offers) paravirt devices, like the vmxnet3 device in vmware
[18:41:04] <sd> 10<a‚Äãlazare619> yea but what I was saying
[18:41:07] <signofzeta> paravirtualization is basically cheating, but you want that.  An "enlightened" OS (to use Microsoft's term) is aware that it's running in a VM, and can adjust itself to be a little more efficient.
[18:41:25] <signofzeta> VMware does it, too, with its vmxnet and pvscsi drivers.
[18:41:27] <sd> 10<a‚Äãlazare619> hyper-v native vs hyper-v paravirt via virtualbox w/ whv  selected hyper-v native is WAAAAAY faster still
[18:41:30] <Hunterkll> i mean, clocks, APIC, debugging/crash, and timer checks isn't much 
[18:41:57] <sd> 10<a‚Äãlazare619> and way lighter on resources which is interesting
[18:42:06] <Hunterkll> I just don't see how - i've always had piss poor performance with vbox because of all the devices it still provides full emulation/virtualization of 
[18:42:22] <sd> 10<a‚Äãlazare619> like i cant see how many resources are free but doing a few benchmarks like prime...the difference is big
[18:42:25] <signofzeta> yeah, there's no point emulating a physical NIC if the guest is "enlightened", for example
[18:42:38] <Hunterkll> I could see it being configuration issues, perhaps
[18:42:57] <Hunterkll> but raw Hyper-V is always going to be faster based on a variety of factors - unless your OS is whack or something else is going on 
[18:43:12] <Hunterkll> Virtualbox even puts the turtle mode icon down on the bar to let you know to expect worse performance
[18:44:03] <fritzwastaken> nerds
[18:44:36] <Hunterkll> oh wait
[18:44:45] <Hunterkll> this isn't using hyper-v at all
[18:44:50] <Hunterkll> it's just emulating hyper-v provided paravirt functions 
[18:45:00] <Hunterkll> so this isn't related to WHV/using virtual box with hyper-v enabled at the same time 
[18:45:10] <Hunterkll> you're using vbox's virtualization/vt-x engine 
[18:45:28] <gibby> fritzwastaken: no u
[18:45:34] <Hunterkll> it's just what virtualbox is faking to the guest OS
[18:45:38] <Hunterkll> that makes a bit more sense
[18:46:15] <Hunterkll> @alazare619 you have to keep in mind that right now, out of box, you have to make a few changes to hyper-v to get "full performance" - things like core affinity/NUMA settings/etc are set by default to be hyper-secure and as a side e ffect greatly reduce host utilization capability 
[18:46:38] <Hunterkll> like it won't let two VMs execute at once on the same core - they have to wait their turn - instead of using the full HT capability of the core
[18:46:47] <Hunterkll> to prevent cpu-core level execution vulns from working cross-VM 
[18:47:19] <pcspkr> yea but that's a mitigation for an actual vulnerability
[18:47:32] <signofzeta> a theoretical one, sure, but it's best to fail-secure than fail-open.
[18:47:35] <pcspkr> there's no current intel hardware that isn't vulnerable to that afaik
[18:47:40] <PublicWiFi> hey random dumb question Hunterkll, what CA template do you use for SSL VPN certs from your win CAs

[19:02:45] <Activ8> a funny video? it's an ouch video lol
[19:03:52] <Hunterkll> @alazare619 VMware workstation has a much more reduced impact when running with hyper-v enabled though - far greater reduced - because they actually put in the work to make it done properly 
[19:03:53] <Hunterkll> lol
[19:04:00] <Hunterkll> but it's still there
[19:04:58] <Hunterkll> vbox is basically "ugh, i guess we can do this"
[19:06:02] <Hunterkll> but the bulk of my action occurs in hyper-v for better vcpu density/storage perf/resource usage 
[19:07:17] <Hunterkll> April release this year supposedly had good ass performance enhancements for windows and solaris guests under Hyper-V mode though

[19:09:16] <sintax> isn't hyper-v going away for server 2022 and gonna be its own product?
[19:09:48] <iphone> just run proxmox
[19:10:14] <signofzeta> sintax: Yes, the free Hyper-V Server is dead.  You need to buy the full Windows Server to use it.
[19:10:14] <estranger> wonder what percentage hyperv has of the enterprise market 
[19:10:27] <vinrock> so many companies have nobody picking up their phones
[19:10:40] <estranger> i feel like its prob <5% .. maybe im wrong. if so, mark your calendars!
[19:10:48] <Hunterkll> signofzeta: the correct answer is 'no'
[19:10:54] <Hunterkll> sintax: Hyper-V as a standalone product is going away
[19:10:59] <Hunterkll> it remains in server & always will 
[19:11:07] <signofzeta> that's what I meant, Hunterkll
[19:11:28] <Hunterkll> there will be no Hyper-V 2022 standalone release as sign said, but there will be Azure Stack HCI & Windows Server 2022 
[19:11:31] <Hunterkll> and also soon
[19:11:34] <iphone> vinrock: I notice that when I try to get takeout. Its like a 50/50 shot of getting someone on the phone
[19:11:37] <Hunterkll> Linux as the dom0/control OS instead of just windows
[19:11:47] <Hunterkll> so you can run a 100% windows free hyper-v setup
[19:11:52] <Hunterkll> and use virtmanager to manage it
[19:11:55] <signofzeta> my last MSP was a Hyper-V shop, but they used the full GUI/paid version.  My current MSP is largely a VMware shop, for what that's worth.
[19:12:17] <Hunterkll> though, i'm not sure how that'll really change performance given some of the benefit derived from hyper-v is windows control OS's hardware drivers in a few scenarios

[20:20:47] <Activ8> probably that
[20:20:48] <Hunterkll> I don't doubt it after it was widespread 
[20:20:53] <Hunterkll> but even so 
[20:21:00] <Hunterkll> that wouldn't be why microsoft shut down the attack vector
[20:21:12] <Activ8> printers are a driver so should require admin privs anyway IMO
[20:21:17] <Hunterkll> well
[20:21:20] <Hunterkll> that's exactly what MS did
[20:21:21] <Hunterkll> lol
[20:21:25] <Activ8> anything to do with drivers should require admin privs
[20:21:31] <Hunterkll> local printers required admin already 
[20:21:32] <Activ8> including shit that auto installs software
[20:21:36] <Hunterkll>  it was just print servers that didnt to deliver 
[20:21:41] <Activ8> not hidden system elevated privs

[20:21:52] <Hunterkll> no?
[20:21:59] <Hunterkll> you can still deliver print server/drivers via GPO 
[20:22:06] <Hunterkll> it's just the click to print functionality
[20:22:07] <Activ8> GPO is fine
[20:22:18] <Activ8> who prints these days anyway
[20:22:22] <Hunterkll> er
[20:22:24] <Hunterkll> point and print 
[20:22:25] <int0x1C8> what is click to print?
[20:22:36] <sd> 02<W‚Äãant a new job!> I hate my gpo, I have to do the gpo and then request it to be aprroved
[20:22:45] <Hunterkll> int0x1C8: user goes into AD, selects printer, clicks add, doesnt need admin
[20:22:47] <Activ8> I worked for a company who went paperless, took out 22 x 5 sites MFDs
[20:22:51] <Hunterkll> https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/print/introduction-to-point-and-print
[20:22:58] <Activ8> was awesome and no more changing toner 
[20:23:02] <Hunterkll> int0x1C8: and other print server delivery methods
[20:23:04] <Hunterkll> either way 
[20:23:10] <PublicWiFi> i remember having to setup point and print a couple years ago to get my auto-install gpo to work
[20:23:14] <sd> 02<W‚Äãant a new job!> I laugh at people when they ask me to change toner lol
[20:23:14] <Hunterkll> i kept calling it click to print when i meant 'point and print'
[20:23:25] <Hunterkll> the point and print behavior is what the recent patch changed
[20:23:28] <teh_f4ll3n> int0x1C8, it's when you point your gun at the printer and cock the hammer saying "Print, Bitch!"
[20:23:28] <PublicWiFi> not even for them to click it in ad but just for logon installs
[20:23:38] <Hunterkll> well yea
[20:23:39] <Activ8> ill shuv a printer up Microsoft arse if they don't stop been sloppy in coding 
[20:23:41] <Hunterkll> how else is it gonna do it?

[20:23:50] <Hunterkll> lol
[20:23:51] <PublicWiFi> how am i supposed to install printers via gpo if it needs admin
[20:23:53] <PublicWiFi> lol
[20:23:57] <sd> 08<b‚Äãdenlinger> and no way to print : (
[20:23:57] <Hunterkll> PublicWiFi: that scenario doesn't
[20:24:01] <int0x1C8> ah, so when you go into devices and printers to add a network shared printer?
[20:24:02] <Activ8> get rid of point to print who needs to print these days it's slowing down
[20:24:06] <Hunterkll> int0x1C8: basically
[20:24:07] <PublicWiFi> yeah so logon installs are dead
[20:24:14] <Hunterkll> PublicWiFi: that scenario doesn't ......
[20:24:20] <PublicWiFi> that scenario doesnt what
[20:24:30] <Hunterkll> when you're processing GPO you're running in a higher context already 
[20:24:38] <Activ8> mhm
[20:24:41] <Hunterkll> point and print still works for GPO printer mapping
[20:24:48] <Hunterkll> and/or driver delivery from print server
[20:24:54] <Hunterkll> it's just *users manually doing it* that requires elevation now 
[20:25:01] <Activ8> anyone here work for microsoft
[20:25:04] <Hunterkll> aka double click on printer in the print server's SMB view 
[20:25:07] <Hunterkll> and add

[20:25:14] <Hunterkll> the user interactively doing it

[20:36:24] <Hunterkll> what do you think is gonna happen?
[20:36:50] <Hunterkll> the platform is great, but like SCCM, it's a blank slate, and you can do a lotta gross shit with it
[20:37:15] <Hunterkll> and not even the "use a sharepoint form to deploy Solaris VMs on Hyper-V managed by an ansible system for sharepoint form driven package deployment" gross like i do
[20:37:32] <Hunterkll> more like "sharepoint is now the file store, we dont use any other features" gross with only one site collection 
[20:38:19] <Hunterkll> "weve replaced all your mapped drives with webdav maps to sharepoint, use that now"
[20:39:39] <AnonymooseReddtr> gross

[20:40:35] <Hunterkll> like, generating the assigned MAC addresses in sharepoint to pass as arguments

[22:15:29] <sintax> but i can turn it in and get like $500 for it
[22:15:31] <iphone> technology can stop right now, pls and thx
[22:15:31] <Hunterkll> so it can have power management/battery benefits
[22:15:38] <vinrock> i have a note 10+ and have never felt like i needed a new phone
[22:15:46] <sintax> i'm a gadget freak :(
[22:15:48] <vinrock> i just buy new ones every two years to be a sperg honestly
[22:15:49] <Hunterkll> 50% faster CPU at the same power envelope can mean far lower real world power usage
[22:15:51] <frostybrew> I dunno what you guys are talking about. Android slowdown is massively noticeable.
[22:15:51] <Activ8> I just don't know how they code so fast 
[22:15:55] <iphone> I can't wait to buy the iphone 47

[22:17:57] <estranger> i get $100/month back from work for it so i dont care much about the price
[22:18:00] <vinrock> i still havent convinced myself to carry two phones
[22:18:03] <iphone> same, iphone 11 from the company
[22:18:03] <Hunterkll> vinrock: got the note 10 because t-mo ran a crazy like $800 trade in promo for my S8+ at the time 
[22:18:05] <vinrock> but these guys keep annoying me so im sure i will soon
[22:18:07] <Hunterkll> or was it $500?
[22:18:12] <vinrock> oh nice
[22:18:13] <Hunterkll> still it was like $100-300 more than ebay value
[22:18:14] <frostybrew> Man, the video is another thing Apple ain't jokin' about.
[22:18:24] <frostybrew> iphone videos really do be hitting different

[22:18:44] <sd> 05<f‚Äãirebarber> Chrome Policy refresh doesn‚Äôt do anything
[22:18:49] <Hunterkll> so it would have been $500 to sell it on ebay (minus fees, shipping, etc!)
[22:19:00] <Hunterkll> or $500 in trade-in credit to pay off the rest via t-mo's jump program 
[22:19:10] <Hunterkll> so it was worth far more to trade in andupgrade to a then-jailbreakable guaranteed handset

[22:20:38] <Hunterkll> yea tiny security update 
[22:20:50] <Hunterkll> vinrock: i find it hilariouis that my same-size lower spec android phone cost more than my iphone 
[22:21:05] <Hunterkll> i mean, outside of RAM but like 
[22:21:11] <Hunterkll> that's just literally compensating for android's insane bloat
[22:21:14] <Activ8> what gets me are these 3 year contracts on mobile phones

[22:41:17] <Hunterkll> frostybrew: oh, that w ill hold true for a long damn time 
[22:41:19] <Hunterkll> but
[22:41:25] <Hunterkll> "the best camera is the one you have"
[22:41:28] <Hunterkll> phones can be good enough
[22:41:33] <vinrock> thats how i see it
[22:41:33] <jr> for general purpose, phones are usually good enough
[22:41:38] <Hunterkll> I still dropped $12k because even this won't be good enough 
[22:41:42] <Hunterkll> for my setup

[22:42:47] <Hunterkll> EOS 1-D X Mark III

[22:42:52] <vinrock> jeuss christ lol

[22:43:02] <Hunterkll> and two 2TB NVMe storage cards for the camera
[22:43:06] <Activ8> what's the web devs doing at apple, their website is still down for maintenance
[22:43:10] <Hunterkll> I can store about 5 hours of 5.5K raw video with it
[22:43:18] <Hunterkll> before needing to swap cards
[22:43:19] <frostybrew> I'm saying that cellphone cameras are the primary place that the technology keeps getting denser.
[22:43:31] <Hunterkll> oh, canon, sony, and nikon are fighting tooth and nail 
[22:43:35] <frostybrew> They just keep pushing the limits of "how small can we make this"
[22:43:35] <sd> 02<W‚Äãant a new job!> Sony has a really good cam phone
[22:43:39] <jr> i don't shoot much video
[22:43:40] <Hunterkll> cellphone cameras will always be 'good enough' 
[22:43:42] <Hunterkll> because there's physics 
[22:43:45] <jr> but i do plenty of photography
[22:43:48] <vinrock> im not upgrading my dslr til canon adds 4k60 to their action body
[22:43:49] <Hunterkll> light collection, focal length, etc 
[22:43:52] <Activ8> for the size of the camera I think it's pretty neat 
[22:43:56] <Hunterkll> vinrock: i can do 4k60 
[22:44:02] <vinrock> yeah well thats a 1dx
[22:44:06] <vinrock> i shoot action with a 7d mk2
[22:44:10] <frostybrew> Just spend $12K 4head
[22:44:11] <Hunterkll> ahhh yea
[22:44:12] <Activ8> how they get that much tech into something so small is nuts
[22:44:14] <Hunterkll> that might take a while
[22:44:22] <Hunterkll> frostybrew: $5k of that was just in two lenses
[22:44:23] <Hunterkll> lol
[22:44:29] <Hunterkll> the camera itself is only $6500 MSRP 
[22:44:35] <Hunterkll> 2TB memory cards are $1k each 
[22:44:37] <jr> if you're going to do video and photos, get a fujifilm x-t4
[22:44:44] <Activ8> nuts
[22:44:54] <vinrock> ive always had good luck with canon so im sticking with em
[22:44:56] <Hunterkll> jr: I already have a large amount of Canon/EOS gear
[22:45:03] <Hunterkll> and their service/pro program is top notch 
[22:45:13] <Activ8> $999, $1099
[22:45:16] <jr> yeah i meant if you don't already have stuff
[22:45:30] <Activ8> 1TB option
[22:45:32] <Hunterkll> i'm talking remote shutter releases for 1/3 series cameras, flash kit, etc that i've accumulated over the years
[22:45:35] <jr> x-t4 is sort of a unicorn camera for me...
[22:45:51] <Hunterkll> i do like that my camera has a built in gigabit RJ-45 jack
[22:45:51] <Hunterkll> lol
[22:45:52] <jr> between the photo and video capabilities, IBIS, lens selection, mirrorless
[22:45:59] <vinrock> oh tat camera is nice
[22:46:00] <Activ8> iphone 11 ¬£499 that's nuts
[22:46:08] <Activ8> that should bring the cost down to end users
[22:46:09] <Hunterkll> jr: yea, canon doesn't yet have an answer to the 1D X in mirrorless
[22:46:09] <jr> only thing missing is a full frame sensor, but that matters less and less these days
[22:46:10] <vinrock> i want a leica mirrorless for when i dont wana lug around the dslr
[22:46:21] <frostybrew> No MacBook news
[22:46:23] <frostybrew> sadge
[22:46:27] <jr> i carry a fujifilm x100v daily
[22:46:32] <Hunterkll> jr: and the camera that's below it in the mirrorless - the R3 - is rumored to cost almost as much as a 1D X Mk III and be less capable in a lot of ways
[22:46:35] <Hunterkll> sure, higher shooting speed
[22:46:42] <Hunterkll> but not when you engage the mechanical shutter
[22:46:42] <Hunterkll> etc
[22:47:00] <Hunterkll> the RF series lenses are fucking sexy though
[22:47:06] <Hunterkll> in how much thinner and lighter they can be for the same mechanical effect
[22:47:09] <jr> yeah those new canons are pretty sweet cameras though
[22:47:26] <Hunterkll> but R3 isn't even really out yet, and i don't know if i'd trust it like a 1 
[22:47:38] <Hunterkll> I trust my 1 with the flash mounted and an L-series lens on 
[22:47:53] <Hunterkll> to lay in the sand digging in while getting hit by ocean water taking pictures of people doing dumb shit in jeeps on the beech
[22:48:04] <Hunterkll> and take it back to my place and wash it off in the sink
[22:48:05] <Hunterkll> lol
[22:48:19] <Hunterkll> without any kind of 3rd party casing/etc
[22:48:21] <frostybrew> Wow, no new airpods news huh?
[22:48:39] <Hunterkll> but like i said - i'd still want that iphone just for its lense assembly

[23:02:21] <DArqueBishop> Hotmess: I still remember when the iPhone came out and people derided it for not having 3G... especially when Samsung phones like the Blackjack had it. Blackjacks were our company smartphone at the time, I knew for a fact that they were absolute pigs for battery power.

[23:40:20] <sintax> save a lot of space.

[23:40:47] <Hunterkll> so you're taking most of the leftover water from wash into the dryer *anyway*
[23:41:05] <sintax> yeah.
