[00:03:28] <rcf> chair1: there is no such thing as passing a true array to a function, they are always converted.
[00:03:33] <fizzie> The problem is with the `const`, not the pointerness. You can pass `score_text` (with no &) to a function accepting a `char **`.
[00:03:48] <fizzie> It's just that there's no implicit conversion from `char **` to `const char **`, because it's not always safe.

I used void** as the parameter type, but the compiler complains that void** doesn't match char** (or uint8_t**). It is possible to cast any pointer to a void*, so I thought it would be fine to cast any double pointer to void**. Apparently this isn't the case? Does anybody know what I need as a parameter in this function to make it work?

[03:50:27] <fizzie> There's no "generic pointer to pointer" type.
[03:50:29] <lwhjp> Try returning (void*) - one star, instead of two; that can be a pointer to anything, including (char*) and (uint8_t*).
[03:50:37] *** Joins: crashrep (~crashrep@user/crashrep)
[03:51:28] <fizzie> If for some reason you can't have it return the new pointer, it's possible to call exactly that function too, you'll just have to jump through extra hoops: `{ void *ret; f(STR, &ret); x = ret; }` for example.
[03:51:37] *** Quits: bolovanos__ (~bolovanos@user/bolovanos) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[03:53:40] <fizzie> You can *convert* any (object) pointer type to `void *`, but that doesn't make all pointers compatible. The only thing a `void **` can point at is a `void *` object. Hence you can't convert an `int **` (that points at an `int *`) into a `void **` (that's expected to point at an `void *`, which may hypothetically have an entirely different representation than `int *`).

[03:59:47] <ka80> OK, thanks for the help. I think I got it to work with like this: https://0x0.st/oonk.txt
[04:00:41] <klys> void** sis = malloc( sizeof( void* ) );  // does this work?
[04:00:42] <fizzie> It's not any more strictly conforming like that.
[04:01:13] <fizzie> As in, it falls in the same "Not portably. Code like this may work --" category described in the FAQ.

[04:01:21] <ka80> If I am reading that FAQ page correctly, this should be portable... right? (famous last words?)
[04:01:58] <fizzie> No. You're passing to the function the address of a `char *` object (`&x`), and then pretending it's the address of a `void *` object (when you dereference `bar`).
[04:02:51] <fizzie> You're just replacing the FAQ example's `(void **)` cast by going `char **` -> `void *` -> `void **`, which also defeats the static type checks.

[04:05:41] <fizzie> (The FAQ might be a little bit understating it when it says different representations for different pointer types are "rare today, but not unheard of". So chances of it working are very high. But if you're aiming for a strictly conforming program, it's not one.)
[04:06:55] <fizzie> This would be another strictly conforming option, FWIW: https://ideone.com/EUwwGM
[04:07:26] <fizzie> Note the difference: in that case, in the `f` function, the pointer is converted back to the correct type before it's used.
[04:08:30] *** Joins: pert (~pert@fsf/member/pert)
[04:08:30] <fizzie> But really as lwhjp said, unless there's something preventing you from doing it, actually returning the pointer is definitely the simplest and cleanest way. You said it yourself, in the question: "I am trying to return a pointer --". So, *return* a pointer, rather than taking an out-parameter.

[16:51:50] <gtlsgamr> Hi there. I am learning C from a book and there is a practice question. I don't understand what exactly the question is trying to say and was hoping someone could explain it. Here is the statement. --> // Write a program detab that replaces tabs in the input with the proper number of blanks to space to the next tab stop. Assume a fixed set of tab stops, say every n columns. Should n be a variable or a
[16:51:56] <gtlsgamr> symbolic parameter?
[16:52:02] <gtlsgamr> I don't want answers, just want to understand the question.
[16:52:41] <dave0> gtlsgamr: do you know the unix command   expand   ? it wants you to write that
[16:53:36] <gtlsgamr> dave0: So basically convert \t to n number of spaces right?
[16:53:50] <dave0> gtlsgamr: yep
[16:53:56] <gtlsgamr> Alright thanks Dave!
[16:54:25] <dave0> gtlsgamr: but it's a little tricker because say it's   hello <tab> world    that tab should only expand to 3 spaces (assuming tabs every 8 spaces)

[16:57:29] <gtlsgamr> so assume that _ is a space. Then 'HELLO__\t___WORLD' should become 'HELLO________WORLD' i.e. the tab should become 3 spaces, and the rest of the spaces remain the same
[16:57:33] <gtlsgamr> is that correct?

[16:58:27] <dave0> i think so
[16:58:32] <koollman> the most tricky part is that almost nobody uses tab stops that way anymore :)
[16:59:36] <gtlsgamr> I guess the question was written with use case of that time in mind. I will still attempt this, just for learning purposes.

[17:00:08] <dave0> did you do the exercise where it counts words? that's like unix command   wc
[17:00:29] <dave0> so you can test your answer against the unix programs
[17:05:44] <ski> gtlsgamr : ".. i.e. the tab should become 3 spaces, and the rest of the spaces remain the same","is that correct?" -- no
[17:06:21] <ski> but i think, using the same notation, that dave0 had `HELLO\tWORLD' to `HELLO___WORLD' in mind
[17:06:42] <gtlsgamr> ski: so just convert the tabs to spaces. that's all
[17:07:02] <ski> (`HELLO' is five characters, so if we start at the first tab stop, it takes three spaces to fill to the next, assuming it's every eight)
[17:07:30] <ski> well, you can't just convert every horizontal tabulation character to `n' spaces
[17:08:22] <ski> (that would give you `HELLO________WORLD')
[17:08:26] <gtlsgamr> hmm.. I am not sure I understand.
[17:08:32] <koollman> not just convert, because you have to count from the start of the line and imagine the 'tab stops'. each tab is like "add space until the next tab stop"
[17:09:54] <gtlsgamr> I found a nice explanation online

[17:18:36] <ChoHag> Why does it say "Should n be a variable or a symbolic parameter?" Did you add that or is it part of the question?
[17:19:19] <gtlsgamr> It is a part of the question.
[17:19:42] <gtlsgamr> I think it is trying to get the reader to "think" about those concepts.
[17:20:00] <ski> yea, where does `n' "come from" ?
[17:20:17] <ski> who determines the value of `n'. what is reasonable to expect ?
[17:20:33] <gtlsgamr> I think the n can be an arbitary value.
[17:21:01] <gtlsgamr> suppose n is 4. what happens if "H\tELLO' is given as input?
[17:21:08] <ski> would it be okay if you wrote `const int n = 10;' in your code ?
[17:21:25] <gtlsgamr> I think so.. #define NUMBER 10
[17:21:32] <ski> yea, or that
[17:22:59] <ski> well, the `H' moves past the initial tab stop. so then the `\t' will add the appropriate number of spaces to move the position to the next tab stop, at which point we'll resume with `ELLO'
[17:23:16] <ski> so, with `n = 4', that gives `H___ELLO'

[17:24:46] <ski> gtlsgamr : i guess one way of thinking about is, is getting into the habit of imagining yourself as a user/customer of your own program. how would you, as a user, prefer the handling/choice of `n' to be dealt with ?
[17:25:40] <ski> would it e.g. be okay for you, as a user, to have the author/implementor (that's you, with another hat on) arbitrarily decide on the value of `n' ? does it matter if you (as user) think their choice of `n' is reasonable or not ?
[17:26:07] <tk> Hi kids, remember that argc can be 0 and argv[0] can be NULL.

[17:28:01] <sham1> Isn't that against POSIX
[17:28:04] <ski> ("user" could be someone who's just starting the program, either from a command-line interface, or by clicking/tapping some icon or menu item. or, whenever you're writing code in a program, and you call a function, you're a user of that function. so, thinking of the user experience is also thinking about the interface of the function, how it's to be called, what information is passed, and how it's passed)
[17:28:29] <tk> sham1: quite possibly, but that doesn't stop multiple popular operating systems from allowing you to execute programs with no argv[0]
[17:28:44] <fizzie> It's only sort of "mildly" against POSIX.
[17:29:33] <fizzie> https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799.2018edition/functions/execve.html "Early proposals required that the value of argc passed to main() be "one or greater". This was driven by the same requirement in drafts of the ISO C standard. -- This requirement was removed from the ISO C standard and subsequently removed from this volume of POSIX.1-2017 as well."
[17:30:21] <sham1> At least it says that argv[0] *should* be a path
[17:30:34] <sham1> > The value in argv[0] should point to a filename string that is associated with the process being started by one of the exec functions.

[17:30:53] <sham1> True
[17:30:56] <pragma-> GDB/MI is weird. It's nearly almost JSON-parseable except they use `foo="bar"` instead of `"foo": "bar"`. With a simple `s/([\w-]+)=/"$1":/g;` regex I can now parse the GDB/MI output with a pre-existing JSON parser. Why didn't they just make it straight-up JSON to begin with. So weird.

[17:32:09] <sham1> Could also be that
[17:32:40] <fizzie> So my reading is, a "Strictly Conforming POSIX Application" must ensure that argc >= 1 and argv[0] != NULL when it executes a program with `execve` or friends (because such a program must follow all the "should"s), but POSIX doesn't quite go as far as to guarantee argv[0] != NULL in all situations.
[17:34:01] <sham1> So yeah, I suppose one should still check that the spawning program isn't being naughty
[17:37:02] <koollman> pragma-: gdb/mi was first released with gdb 5.1, November 21, 2001. json was devised 'between 2002 and 2005'. Sure, they *could* make a new output setting or version. But they do have a pretty decent excuse for not starting with it :)

[20:25:53] <Guest96fd> Hey, quick question. Is it possible to provide a `/dev/null`-esque pointer to memcpy? I.e. I have a buffer library I'm using, and I'd like to pop data without allocating a buffer for it
[20:26:55] <sham1> What do you mean "pop data"
[20:27:23] *** Joins: zmt00 (~zmt00@user/zmt00)
[20:28:44] <Guest96fd> I have a library function that I unfortunately cannot modify. It accepts a buffer pointer to write data into, i.e. memcpy(queue_src, buffer_dest, len). I want to pop the data to free up space in the queue but without allocating a buffer for the potentially large data as I am memory constrained
