[00:36:03] <rocx> not going to lie having a bunch of "!= nil" is a major turnoff. have to pull this crap in java all the time. at least crystal does it right by making null a type of its own and Optional<T> is just a type union of T | Nil.
[00:36:54] <technomancy> hm it's almost as if they did the slightest bit of research before running off to implement things
[00:37:08] <rocx> who? go or crystal?
[00:37:16] <technomancy> crystal
[00:37:53] <rocx> ah. yeah. you come for the rubylike syntax and you stay for the impressive type system. the billion dollar mistake was making every type a union of itself and null.
[00:38:10] <technomancy> lol
[00:38:10] <rocx> insofar that i've played with, crystal's the only one that even does this right.
[00:38:32] <rocx> unless haskell did something like that too but i'm not a good haskellist.
[00:38:38] <technomancy> "let's make a type system that's specificially incapable of preventing the single most common type error in existence" ok man whatever you say
[00:38:45] <wink> my crystal experience can be summed up as:
[00:38:45] <wink> - this looks like ruby? (I don't know ruby)
[00:38:45] <wink> - man this is slow... oh, you can compile it
[00:39:06] <rocx> wink: an interpreter/REPL is kind of ready to use now but probably more of a beta.
[00:39:19] <technomancy> not unioning null to every type implicitly is definitely not a crystal-specific thing
[00:39:22] <pushcx> pareto-optimal-d: we don't tend to go quite so hard into making fun of people we disagree with
[00:39:26] <technomancy> it's a "I know what types are" thing
[00:39:32] <wink> this was a while ago. you could somehow "run" it like "go run x.go" and it was slow
[00:39:41] <rocx> technomancy: i get that. i just haven't played with anything else that did the same thing.
[00:40:47] <rocx> i should get back into my matrix homeserver project. thankfully there's amber to do web APIs.
[00:42:37] <riv> why don't these complaints apply to e.g. python?
[00:42:44] <pareto-optimal-d> pushcx: Yeah, I can get that. At one time I was enamored by Go coming from Python. I wouldn't have felt so great about that thread.

[00:43:13] <technomancy> riv: "if you can't design a type system that doesn't get this right; don't bother trying" <- python doesn't even try, which is better than trying and failing

[00:43:23] <riv> that argument doesn't make sense to me
[00:43:44] <rocx> and ruby is duck-typed by relying on the #method_defined? method for the class.

[04:52:27] <rocx> holy frick what's with everyone all of the sudden coming out of the woodwork with an offical statement that they're not going down the NFT art-scam route? what triggered this in the first place (barring Bored Ape).

[04:54:26] <kline> rocx, dunno but im really glad that we're publicly shitting on NFTs
[04:54:44] <rocx> yeah true but still it seems a little unwarranted.
[04:55:01] <kline> i think its just an extension of the performative signalling required boost your corps esteem in the youth market
[04:55:27] <rocx> never mind i think it's because chaosium (of call of c'thulu fame) is getting into it. that explains the TTRPG part.
[04:55:52] <kline> for many corps, theres no applicable model for NFTs, so you might as well try to make a stance on it to show you are environmentally engaged
[04:57:22] <rocx> i still don't get their point besides a public receipt.
[04:59:22] <companion_cube> rocx: please be aware that I'm not going down the NFT route
[04:59:27] <companion_cube> thank you for your attention.
[05:00:17] <rocx> i mean... that's pretty much what's going on, companion_cube. just feels so unnecessary.

[18:04:51] <kline> pushcx, does the gem package manager not store historical versions?
[18:09:04] <pushcx> They deleted it from rubygems.org, I guess because they wanted people to use the unfinished rewrite to Crystal.
[18:09:27] <pushcx> and from the arch package manager
[18:10:21] <vladimyr> rubygems allows deleting published stuff? :o

[19:07:39] <pushcx> I dug it out of archive.org but, yeah, it doesn't include a gemfile.lock or a built version that would have it or the deps themselves.
