[15:07:56] <artao> macrobat did you go to a store and try out different practice pads?
[15:08:13] <artao> just ordering em online can be risky. tho there ARE generally youtube demos/reviews
[15:11:12] <artao> and speakers
[15:11:52] <artao> tho EVERYONE seems to have a pair of KRK Rokits of one sort or another
[15:14:40] <artao> i've heard people say they don't sound good
[15:14:45] <artao> but i'm pretty sure that's their music
[15:14:55] <artao> they aren't made to sound "good," they're made to sound honest
[15:15:09] <artao> so if something doesn't sound good, it's more likely the music itself
[15:15:24] <artao> which, of course, is the whole point of studio monitors
[15:15:44] <artao> but Yamaha also has a highly respected set at the same price point
[15:16:09] <artao> 400usd. maybe 300 if you can find em on sale
[15:16:43] <louipc> yea but no speakers other than reference monitors gonna be honest
[15:17:07] <artao> there's different price levels
