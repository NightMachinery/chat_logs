[00:03:54] <phc> i have no faith in any seagate drives
[00:04:01] <phc> and never will 
[00:04:13] <phc> although i do own a few drives that are still going after 10+ years
[00:04:23] <phc> well, not continuous use
[00:04:57] <rawktucc> :/
[00:05:02] <rawktucc> so you have some faith then
[00:05:17] <phc> they've made their choice
[00:05:24] <phc> in QC standards
[00:05:39] <rawktucc> are you basing it on the 3tb fiasco
[00:05:56] <phc> no my friend.  i made up my mind years before that
[00:12:52] <phc> i think theyve resolved to set their acceptable quality standards just slightly below that of WD
[00:13:04] <phc> which are, for the purposes of my time and data, already unacceptably low 
[00:13:09] <phc> although ive had a good run lately 
[00:13:25] <rawktucc> nothing is perfect
[00:13:28] <rawktucc> which is why backups exist
[00:13:30] <phc> indeed
[00:13:33] <rawktucc> i think im gonna get this 160TB server
[00:13:35] <rawktucc> I keep saying it but

[00:13:44] <rawktucc> no, SX134
[00:13:49] <rawktucc> it's expensive,, but...
[00:14:03] <rawktucc> rebuilding my local server will be an equal cost, without any sort of support or other guarantees
[00:14:18] <phc> ive got the bare minimum feral box, but it gets me by

[00:53:49] <evilgohan2> skye0: read the article (re: Firefox)
[00:53:56] <evilgohan2> it's not whether or not we need firefox
[00:53:57] <skye0> interesting. kinda weird too considering how they're a big newspaper that would otherwise benefit from it, but since the US has soldiers all over the world, they are invested in being prepared for cyber warfare against china and russia too
[00:54:02] <evilgohan2> it's what the fuck is Mozilla doing
[00:54:07] <rawktucc> "Ava Majury, center, has dinner with her brother Logan, at left, and her parents, Kim and Rob. Since the shooting in July, the Majurys had to leave their neighborhood and move into a rental house."
[00:54:10] <skye0> yeah, mozilla is being fucky
[00:54:10] <rawktucc> oh cause that's stable
[00:54:20] <rawktucc> i use icecat
[00:54:23] <rawktucc> i encourage everyone to use it
[00:54:25] <evilgohan2> like, you've got the most privacy focused browser on the market
[00:54:26] <skye0> would be nice if we had another alternative but our javascript bloated web is doing no one a favor
[00:54:34] <rawktucc> before someone says "ICECAT IS OUTDATED", stop looking at the prebuilt binary
[00:54:36] <rawktucc> compile from source
[00:54:36] <evilgohan2> Your company has preached privacy as a core value for 2 decades
[00:54:38] <Myself> Heh. The first time I went to meet a girl from online was 1996 and if _anyone_ had heard of "the internet", it was probably in the context of scare stories of creepers on "the internet". So that was great. 
[00:54:42] <evilgohan2> why the actual fuck are you working with Meta
[00:54:51] <skye0> yeah :/
[00:54:53] <rawktucc> Icecat is literally Firefox ESR with all Mozilla branding stripped, plus some unnecessary addons added (which can be removed or disabled)
[00:55:18] <skye0> compatibility will be the only reason. thing is, this vaguely reminds me of how spotify and netflix even got popular
[00:55:22] <rawktucc> https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/icecat
[00:55:29] <skye0> it was way more convenient for people to stream than pirate
[00:55:46] <skye0> it'll be more convenient for people to go to AR/VR than work in physical offices
[00:55:48] <evilgohan2> yeah, but netflix as the sole streamer (with Hulu) isn't the case anymore
[00:55:54] <evilgohan2> now streaming is starting to look like cable
[00:55:57] <skye0> yup
[00:55:58] <rawktucc> it IS cable
[00:56:02] <evilgohan2> so it's becoming easier to pirate again
[00:56:10] <evilgohan2> at least, at the mainstream.
[00:56:14] <rawktucc> it's only easy to pirate if the content is available
[00:56:25] <evilgohan2> I don't want to pay Amazon, Netflix, Disney, NBC, Paramount, HBO, etc.
[00:56:26] <skye0> although at this point it seems like an unwelcome intrusion especially with facebook spearheading the whole project, and pandemic denialists who wouldn't give a shit about meta
[00:56:32] <skye0> i want to keep my shit
[00:56:34] <evilgohan2> Oh yeah, and Apple
[00:56:38] <skye0> so i'd rather pirate at all costs
[00:56:47] <rawktucc> skye0, at no cost :P
[00:56:56] <evilgohan2> At this point, pirating is easier. Hell, pirating is easier sometimes than watching the legit way even if you pay
[00:56:59] <skye0> yup, but not necessarily ones involving money
[00:56:59] <evilgohan2> looking at you HBO MAX
[00:57:09] <rawktucc> i mean using a VPN would cost money
[00:57:18] <rawktucc> but so does paying for internet
[00:57:28] <skye0> blu-rays will not work on newest devices because intel decided to legacy the fuck out of the hardware that made it possible to even run it in the first place
[00:57:34] <rawktucc> skye0, incorrect
[00:57:37] <rawktucc> on WINDOWS
[00:57:38] <evilgohan2> not true.
[00:57:46] <evilgohan2> also, still works on AMD
[00:57:47] <rawktucc> you can still play new blurays on linux, macos, or using OTHER windows software
[00:57:49] <rawktucc> and yes on AMD
[00:57:51] <skye0> nice
[00:58:09] <rawktucc> it's literally just one software company product that stopped working because of their reliance on SGX
[00:58:13] <rawktucc> there are other options on Windows at least
[00:58:16] <evilgohan2> Cyberlink PowerDVD
[00:58:21] <rawktucc> and you can use MPV or VLC still, I believe
[00:58:23] <skye0> but yeah, the new technological "innovations" we have seem to be unwelcome compared to like spotify and netflix in their early days
[00:58:29] <skye0> i still use VLC
[00:58:32] <evilgohan2> lol, I use Media Player Classic to this day
[00:58:34] <evilgohan2> some VLC
[00:58:36] <rawktucc> AACS 1.0 or 2.0, whatever bluray uses, is broken as fuck. UHD is more complicated but I don't understand that
[00:58:42] <rawktucc> I should really order a bluray drive
[00:58:47] <evilgohan2> You can break UHD as well
[00:58:53] <rawktucc> yes, it's doable
[00:58:56] <evilgohan2> I have a Blu-Ray drive and another that supports BDXL
[00:58:58] <rawktucc> but i meant forplaying the disc as is
[00:59:04] <evilgohan2> oh, VLC supports that.
[00:59:05] <rawktucc> evilgohan2, which model? I need to buy one for BDXL 128GB

[02:31:47] <phc> it was a bad sign four years ago when you couldnt buy a 4K that wasn't a smart tv
[02:32:08] <NeoThermic> pop it open, disconnect the antenna, never connect it to a network

[02:37:45] <KevinCarbonara> if it were consumer oriented
[02:38:00] <NeoThermic> it almost never is, though
[02:38:08] <NeoThermic> where's the profit in that? :P
[02:38:13] <KevinCarbonara> how are ads in a tv not illegal?
[02:38:57] <skye0> corporate lobbyists
[02:39:12] <skye0> all i want though is a monitor, not one to just idly watch TV or films
[02:39:34] <skye0> i'd say buy more monitors and use those instead but they'll still find ways to milk money from us using them
[02:39:37] <KevinCarbonara> I'll get a roku or something, those are supposed to be pretty good
[02:39:53] <KevinCarbonara> I do want a new TV, but I need one with low input lag and no ads
[02:40:03] <NeoThermic> we have a nuc running a light linux distro, and it just streams from jellyfin
[02:40:12] <NeoThermic> we don't watch live TV, and we don't miss it :P
[02:40:50] <KevinCarbonara> I don't either
[02:40:57] <KevinCarbonara> but I do use plex, which is something some smart tvs support
[02:41:03] <KevinCarbonara> that's the kind of functionality I appreciate
[02:41:49] <NeoThermic> usually poorly, works for a year or so and then something fundamental changes and the TV version never gets updated
[02:45:56] <KevinCarbonara> that's probably true
[02:46:04] <KevinCarbonara> I still am willing to defend the *idea* of a smart TV

[21:29:00] <rawktucc> organizing music collections is so annoying
[21:29:22] <x10> https://beets.io/ << use this
[21:29:26] <x10> it's amazing
[21:29:39] <rawktucc> that's destructive though
[21:29:44] <x10> nope
[21:29:52] <x10> read the manual
[21:29:57] <rawktucc> i dont trust musicbrainz
[21:30:03] <rawktucc> x10 how do you retain original checksums
[21:30:36] <x10> don't care about them
[21:30:44] <rawktucc> I do, so
[21:31:41] <x10> but there's a just copy mode, so you can keep original files, just move them into /artist/album - (year)/untouched files.whatevs
[21:32:03] <x10> or whatever structure you'd like
[21:33:27] <x10> got about 240 gig done with that program, used to be a pita to organize

[21:47:14] <rawktucc> metamorphose doesn't handle my thousands of folders. krename doesn't have a move text feature. trying to do a regex is annoying. thunar's rename is not that good
[21:47:23] <rawktucc> rename.pl is just sed/regex
[21:48:13] <x10> feed your folder into beets, set it to move files only in a new location, so checksums don't change it will just make folders according to your wishes a move stuff there
[21:48:37] <x10> i used to have an /incoming folder that just got fed into beets once/day
[21:49:24] <rawktucc> naming structures on folders is annoying
