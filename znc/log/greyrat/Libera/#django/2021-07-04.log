[06:45:54] <ttardis> the browseable API is working fine for CRUD with records that I upload a file as one of the fields in the model... but front end TemplateHTMLRenderer fails.  Anyone come across that issue? I can be more specific but it's a quiet room and I feel weird even asking
[06:52:10] <GinFuyou> You could try sharing your error\traceback via dpaste.org. I fear I don't have deep knowledge of DRF and on weekends channel is more quiet
[07:17:49] <ttardis> I figured.  I think it would actually be faster to just do the workarounds than try to get an answer, LOL. I just don't like it... it's clunky and I wanted the darned features to work as expected

[14:42:26] <wallbroken> is not that true... i'm dealing with the same problem since weeks. i created a view class with form valid method,  but the form doesn't validates and i don't know why. traceback says nothing. i also added {{ form.errors }} in the template but i don't know why the form isn't validating.

[15:00:24] <wallbroken> it is in formset_valid

[22:45:58] <ChrisWarrick> wallbroken: are you sure #django is the right place to ask for help in quizzes?
[22:54:50] <wallbroken> ChrisWarrick: yes, i'm sure. because people here told me to learn django

[22:55:27] <ChrisWarrick> okay, then learn django and programming, and the answer will be obvious
[22:57:15] <wallbroken> ...
[22:58:30] <ChrisWarrick> I’m serious
[22:58:49] <ChrisWarrick> work on understanding what each of the four answers mean

[23:46:27] <wallbroken> nedbat: why do you want to know?
[23:46:54] <nedbat> wallbroken: i haven't seen questions like this before, and we try not to give answers to homework assignments
[23:47:11] <wallbroken> nedbat: which homeworks?
[23:47:23] <wallbroken> don't say random things please
[23:47:37] <nedbat> wallbroken: this sounds like homework, so we want to know if it is.
[23:47:50] <wallbroken> homework of what?
[23:48:13] <nedbat> wallbroken: i don't know.  quizzes like this are often used as homework, which is why i am asking.
[23:48:52] <wallbroken> i don't have any homework about django to do
[23:48:59] <wallbroken> i just have a project to finish.
[23:50:39] <nedbat> wallbroken: ok, then i'm still curious where you found that quiz, and why you are trying to answer it?
[23:52:45] <wallbroken> just a self test
[23:53:16] <nedbat> wallbroken: that's cool. where did you find it?
[23:53:29] <wallbroken> i found it on linkedin
[23:53:40] <wallbroken> you search the topic
[23:53:52] <wallbroken> and you will find the test you want
[23:54:30] <wallbroken> the questions was very easy and i got a good score on that test
[23:54:39] <wallbroken> but i was not sure about that question
[23:54:50] <wallbroken> then i haven't answered on it
