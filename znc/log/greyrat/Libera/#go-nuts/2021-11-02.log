[01:21:31] <mort> it's weird that go only permits you to post increment
[01:22:01] <mort> I'm usually not looking for the weird "evaluate to the old value, but silently update to a new value in the background after the expression was evaluated" behavior
[01:23:20] <b0nn> uhh, you think a++ is weird, but ++a isn't because of when it's incremented?
[01:25:20] <j416> mort: you can't assign "a++" to anything in Go anyway, it's just a statement, so "++a" would have no purpose.
[01:25:40] <krux02> I god used to not use increment operators at all
[01:25:43] <mort> b0nn: yeah, ++a is what you usually mean, it's a short-hand for 'a += 1'
[01:25:53] <mort> j416: I suppose that makes sense
[01:25:57] <krux02> since incrementing a number by one isn't worth a language feature, when there is already +=
[01:26:13] <krux02> I just write += 1 all the time
[01:26:18] <mort> but when I see i++ it always reads like a post-increment and usually a post-increment isn't what you want
[01:26:28] <krux02> and then I got this linter that put me warning everywhere because of it.
[01:26:37] <krux02> As a result I deleted the linter from my system.
[01:27:00] <j416> krux02: thought you'd say you made 1 into var one = 1
[01:27:03] * j416 runs
[01:27:53] <b0nn> mort: semantically it's the difference between "Get me the CURRENT value of a, then increment it for the next round" vs "Get me the NEXT value of a"
[01:28:23] <krux02> j416, ? I have no idea what you mean
[01:28:40] <mort> b0nn: yeah, that's what I described isn't it? i++ is (in other languages at least) "evaluate to the old value, but silently update to a new value in the background after the expression was evaluated"
[01:28:55] <j416> krux02: "one := 1; a += one" might silence your linter
[01:29:00] <b0nn> tomato tomato, old is current
[01:29:23] <b0nn> get me the 0th value of the array, then point to the 1th vs get me the 1th
[01:29:57] <krux02> j416, I found a better way to silence the linter.
[01:30:09] <fizzie> mort: It's not really that in C. Neither `a++` nor `++a` specify when exactly the actual incrementing (the side effect that updates the object) is done, they just differ in which value the operator yields. `++a` could equally well "update to a new value in the background after the expression is evaluated".
[01:30:10] <j416> krux02: yes, it was an attempt at a joke.
[01:30:20] <krux02> I just didn't find a way yet to silence go on unused variables/imports
[01:30:28] <j416> haha
[01:30:30] <krux02> j416, yea I figured it was a joke
[01:30:40] <j416> fork it, make your own Go

[01:31:05] *** Quits: jpw (~jpw@user/jpw) (Remote host closed the connection)
[01:31:06] <mort> it's just weird to have the only increment operator as the one where you create a temporary with the old value, increment the real value, then evaluate to the temporary
[01:31:12] <j416> krux02: does it have i++ ?
[01:31:13] <krux02> it won't have this stupid error message, it will be a warning
[01:31:16] <mort> not a big deal in any case
[01:31:26] <krux02> j416, nope it won't have an increment operator
[01:31:33] <krux02> just +=
[01:31:48] <krux02> it isn't a promise though.
[01:31:55] <krux02> I don't plan to add ++

[02:15:56] <fizzie> attila_lendvai: The code that's actually *using* that dependency uses the import path "github.com/google/go-cmp/cmp".
[02:16:41] <attila_lendvai> j416, ouch. that'd be very painful/complex in this context...
[02:17:11] <fizzie> It's not that "the sources of go-cmp" are under that directory; it's just that the package called "cmp" of that module is in the subdirectory "cmp", just like the package "github.com/google/go-cmp/foo" (if it existed) would be in the directory "foo".
[02:17:33] <attila_lendvai> i would define a constant map for such outlier projects before i get into parsing go sourcecode... :)
[02:18:19] <fizzie> It's not really any sort of an "outlier", IMO. What makes up "the sources of go-cmp" is everything under the module directory, excluding any *other* directories with go.mod files of their own.
[02:18:41] <attila_lendvai> fizzie, yeah, i kinda get that by now. but in most cases the dependency specification contains the extra part of the package name, or the full name (i lack the nomenclature, sorry)

[02:19:35] <fizzie> There's any number of modules that contain more than one package in them. Sure, most of them have *some* code in the root directory, but still.
[02:20:15] <attila_lendvai> fizzie, the problem is that guix wants to individually build each (guix) package. the importer creates a package for go-cmp, and when it tries to build it, it fails because "no go files in ...". i can patch the package by hand to make it work, but i was hoping for a more automated solution.
[02:21:08] <attila_lendvai> IOW, it would probably just work when a package uses it as a dependency, but it fails when it's built as a standalone package (which probably shouldn't even happen, but...)

[02:23:28] <b0nn> recursive exploration of the packages in the module?
[02:24:48] <b0nn> hrm, for my $0.02 I'd inspect the imports and build the packages within the module that are in the import tree (ie. I'd ignore that which isn't imported)

[02:25:54] <attila_lendvai> b0nn, "the imports" here means the import statements at the beginning of go files?

[02:55:02] <attila_lendvai> b0nn, no, there isn't. see my previous line.

[02:55:26] * b0nn is thinking that the error "no go files to build" is go installl compalinaing that it can't do anything
[02:55:38] <Tv_> attila_lendvai: it might be cargo culting behavior from before modules existed
[02:56:21] <attila_lendvai> Tv_, argh! are you telling me that *sometimes* go install should be called? when something depends on a go lib that is very old?
[02:56:46] *** Quits: _xor (~xor@72.49.199.147) (Ping timeout: 245 seconds)
[02:56:47] <Tv_> attila_lendvai: not the lib, Go itself -- and nobody should use a version of Go that old
[02:57:15] <attila_lendvai> well, either way, that can't work, because the guix builder throws away everything except the sources
[02:57:19] <Tv_> me personally, i consider reimplementing the go tool a bad idea
[02:59:05] <attila_lendvai> Tv_, me, too. i'd fancy much more the NixOS way. they call vendoring: they use the go binary to fetch all the dependencies of a "toplevel" package once, and then swallow it as one big archive into their caches.
[02:59:20] <Tv_> to live a in hermetic reproducable offline world, what you have for libraries is (cached) modules & their built versions as input and the built version of your target as output, and what you have for commands (package main) is cached modules & their built  versions as input and an executable as output
[02:59:28] <Tv_> anything else is guix doing it wrong ;)

[02:59:53] <Tv_> one big archive is doing it wrong too, but at least it's wrong in the sense of suboptimal, not wrong in the sense of incorrect
[03:02:10] <attila_lendvai> there's no good match between something like guix/nixos and go's module system. they are two parallel solutions for the same problem, and there's no seamless way to integrate them.
[03:02:27] <Tv_> i just described the match ;)
[03:02:35] <Tv_> that nobody bothers implementing it is something else
[03:02:48] <Tv_> not many people seem to bother understanding what go modules really are
[03:03:47] <Tv_> "i'll just close my eyes hum real loud and pretend everything is C" is a common way to "package" things

[03:25:15] <attila_lendvai> Tv_, i think what you suggest cannot work either: what happens when two main packages import the same lib, but they are compiled with different compiler options? this means you can't just simply map go libs to guix/nix derivations that contain build artifacts. (without really reimplementing everything the go binary does wrt modules and compiler artifacts)

[16:52:53] <fizzie> As for `errors.Is`, it checks for *types* of errors, you can't use it to check for other properties of the error.
[16:54:11] <fizzie> Checking for properties of the error could look like `var e *exec.ExitError; if errors.As(err, &e) && e.ProcessState.ExitCode() == 1 { /* do something */ }`.

[16:57:08] <fizzie> (Hmm, I guess since it does an equality check, you could in fact use `errors.Is` for more than checking the type? But definitely not for something like testing if calling a method on a field returns something.)
[16:57:48] <fizzie> Led_Zeppelin2: It's neither. You have to do something like `var str = "foo"; d(&str)`, or use a helper function like `func str(s string) *string { return &s }`.
[16:57:59] <Led_Zeppelin2> i see.

[18:42:02] <junon> Seems I'm hitting a chicken-and-egg scenario with `go mod tidy`. We have a generative step that requires `go run` to generate some packages for us (namely, via Ent) but the command cannot run for me right now without running `go mod tidy`. Unclear what the changes were that lead to this but here we are. Now that I run `go mod tidy`, it's complaining that the "query for latest" checks are failing because... the packages are missing.
[18:42:26] <junon> There's no clear way to fix this. Is there a way to tell `go run` "hey, skip the damn tidy check" manually just once?
[18:42:34] <junon> I'm completely dead in the water right now at work.
[18:45:46] <junon> ... Once again, I go through the hours of debugging, come here, ask and then.. find the answer immediately after. `got mod tidy -e`, re-generate, `go mod tidy` was the magical incantation. It would be nice if `go mod tidy` suggested, upon error, that passing `-e` might work if you're trying to recover from this exact scnario.

[20:52:38] <junon> sounds like you want memory mapping, depending on the data structure and how you interact with it.
[20:54:17] <seebs> memory mapping is certainly a plausible approach. how fast it is or isn't may depend a lot on frequency of use and contention for disk cache

[20:55:44] <Led_Zeppelin2> i append data to the slice very quickly. concurrently RWutex. When the data size is large, say few billion rows, i can see it use a lot of resident memory. I don't want it to use that.
[20:55:57] <Led_Zeppelin2> was thinking I create a buffer and dump it to disk when it hits a threashold.
[20:56:05] *** Joins: andlabs_ (~andlabs@2604:ca00:17b:b7:9d88:6a46:3566:34be)
[20:56:29] <siXy> You're likely better off using an embedded database, rather than designing your own bespoke data storage.
[20:57:26] <siXy> This sounds rather a lot like a metric storing system - append only, lots of tiny data points, and wanting to do sum/mean/etc across the points
[20:58:20] <Led_Zeppelin2> it is.
[20:58:33] <siXy> therefore I'd suggest looking at a timeseries DB - you could use something like prometheus or influx, but they're kind of large. There are some embedabble ones but I don't have enough first hand exp to personally recommend a particular one of those
[20:58:36] <Led_Zeppelin2> i throw away the data after my program runs though
[20:59:04] <Led_Zeppelin2> ha no. influx or promethus will be too slow. there is a RPC that I would have to do.
[20:59:11] *** Quits: andlabs (~andlabs@2604:ca00:17b:b7:7040:a8de:c81e:3eea) (Ping timeout: 264 seconds)
[20:59:37] <seebs> hmm
[20:59:39] <Led_Zeppelin2> i think embedded database sounds ideal.  And I don't need timeseries database. Just a good bucket to store stuff.
[20:59:46] <Led_Zeppelin2> and destroy after its done.
[20:59:48] <siXy> I'd also question if you really need the raw data - can't you aggregate it a bit - precompute those data points down some?
[20:59:56] <seebs> That sounds mmap-ish
[21:00:05] <seebs> what are the actual entries in the data?
[21:00:09] <Led_Zeppelin2> no, i need those datapoints to do distributions.
[21:00:16] <siXy> maybe a distribution of points over a 60s window or something.
[21:00:50] <Led_Zeppelin2> seebs, [1,2,3,4,121,23232,11,223...] thats how the data looks like. Just billions of them.
[21:01:22] <A_Dragon> what are you doing with the data?
[21:01:24] <seebs> if you're appending data to the thing you probably don't want/need an rwmutex
[21:01:39] <seebs> can there be duplicate data points, or is it just individual numbers being present or not present, or?
[21:01:45] <siXy> sure, but if you have 1 billion points, that's a lot. you could probably aggregate to a larger window - even if it's like a 5s window or something - and avoid having each individual point stored.
[21:01:48] <seebs> are there timestamps or anything, or is it just "here's all the numbers we've seen lately"?
[21:01:55] <Led_Zeppelin2> I am summarizing the data.
[21:02:15] <Led_Zeppelin2> seebs, yes! there can be duplicate data points.
[21:02:16] <seebs> summarizing admits, to some extent, doing partial summarizations of individual hunks and then summarizing those.
[21:02:33] <Led_Zeppelin2> siXy, the data is stationary. its not time series.
[21:02:51] <A_Dragon> I'd divide and conquer the math you want to do, or just wait for it to finish
[21:02:58] <Led_Zeppelin2> seebs, the later. "here are the numbers we've seen"
[21:02:58] <A_Dragon> are there particular bounds to the numbers?
[21:03:11] <Led_Zeppelin2> [0,n]
[21:03:23] <A_Dragon> where n is....?
[21:03:30] <Led_Zeppelin2> correct. its ?
[21:03:39] <A_Dragon> so its unbounded, got it.
[21:03:53] <A_Dragon> I was going to suggest using a smaller datatype at least
[21:03:55] <Led_Zeppelin2> right. i suppose you can say n is uint64
[21:04:27] *** Parts: junon (~junon@user/junon) ()
[21:04:28] <Led_Zeppelin2> seebs, and I agree with rwmutex. I am just using it because its working so well. I should change it to for optimization. thats later on
