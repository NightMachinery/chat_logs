[01:35:44] <Joanna> Hi everyone
[02:39:13] <jan6> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UexnNwefdQA
[02:39:20] <jan6> yet another video to share with "normies"
[02:39:27] <jan6> "7 Privacy Measures that won't make your life difficult"
[02:39:49] <jan6> it's just the base level of "don't use chrome, try not to use google" etc
[02:40:06] <jan6> "use a VPN"
[02:44:15] <Bitweasil> Sorry.
[02:44:19] <Bitweasil> Let me get this straight.
[02:44:25] <Bitweasil> "Try not to use Google."
[02:44:27] <Bitweasil> In a video.
[02:44:29] <Bitweasil> On YouTube?
[02:44:30] <Bitweasil> wtf.
[02:47:21] <jan6> well, if you prefer, https://odysee.com/@TheLinuxExperiment:e/7-privacy-measures-that-won't-make-your:8
[02:48:09] <jan6> but as I said, it's for normies
[02:48:18] <Bitweasil> Danke.
[02:48:30] <Bitweasil> ... I wonder if that will play in my browser.
[02:48:38] <Bitweasil> Video is usually broken for me.
[02:48:58] <jan6> like what, you'd expect normal people to use odysee/lbry, or something, lol, of course it's on youtube
[02:49:03] <jan6> there's invidious, after all
[02:49:33] <Bitweasil> Is Odysee a Peertube instance?
[02:49:36] <Bitweasil> I'm not actually familiar with it.
[02:49:38] <jan6> and youtube-dl-based stuff, like newpipe for android (apparently yt-dlp is the more up to date fork)
[02:49:40] <jan6> nah
[02:50:05] <jan6> odysee is https://lbry.com/
[02:50:15] <jan6> well a frontend for it, at least... pretty much...
[02:50:23] <jan6> there's also native clients
[02:50:55] <Bitweasil> Ah, ok.
[02:50:58] <Bitweasil> I'm familiar with that.
[02:51:44] <Bitweasil> Or, at least, have run across it.
[02:51:46] <jan6> it's basically "what if youtube, but you could get paid for watching stuff, without ads", on top of normal lbry, afaik
[02:51:53] <Bitweasil> I really ought to light up a PeerTube mirror at some point.
[02:51:57] <Bitweasil> s/mirror/instance/
[02:52:18] <Bitweasil> ...
[02:52:26] <jan6> well, peertube has the problem of...peers, lol
[02:52:36] <Bitweasil> Yeah, I'm a few minutes into him yapping about linode.
[02:53:04] <Bitweasil> Sorry, what's the problem with peertube?
[02:53:09] *** Quits: gproto23 (~gproto23@user/gproto23) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[02:53:19] <jan6> in principle, nothing, I guess
[02:53:38] <Bitweasil> And if you're not building your own stuff from source, "being able to read the source" doesn't gain you a lot.
[02:53:53] * Bitweasil mutters something about how a certain log library was open source and a steaming pile of remotely exploitable shit for... how many years?
[02:54:25] <jan6> well, it does if you assume they're not going through extra steps to make the binaries malicious
[02:54:38] <Bitweasil> On Trusting Trust. :(
[02:54:45] <jan6> at least it's not rust
[02:54:54] <Bitweasil> Worse.  It's C. :p
[02:55:09] <jan6> it's just that nobody cares about testing the security of most stuff, especially non-flashy stuff
[02:55:29] <jan6> just the same as everyone assumes foss projects must be getting enough donations, so i don't have to
[02:56:08] <jan6> as I heard, log4j had a singular donator before this huge revelation, and now has like...14...
[02:56:11] <Bitweasil> xkcd... 
[02:56:11] <jan6> lol
[02:56:12] <Bitweasil> Yeah.
[02:56:30] <Bitweasil> https://xkcd.com/2347/ in practice.
[02:56:43] <jan6> yep, everyone loves that
[02:57:09] <jan6> and it's especially true for npm-style ecosystems (I think rust's also having a less severe version of that cargo-cult)
[02:57:16] <jan6> remember left-pad?
[02:57:17] <jan6> lol
[02:58:06] <jan6> the solution was obviously "well...ok you just can't delete packages if they're used in some project", instead of "maybe this is a bad model to build a tower of cards on"
[02:58:09] <Bitweasil> left-pad: Doing it's own best left-shark impression.
[02:58:28] <jan6> npm literally has is-even and is-odd as separate packages
[02:58:41] <Bitweasil> I don't get that whole thing.
[02:58:47] <jan6> and iirc, is-odd is literally doing "return !is-even(stuff)"
[02:58:49] <Bitweasil> I curse at it often enough, being dumb enough to run aarch64.
[02:59:09] <Bitweasil> Node: "ermegerd, 64-bit!  I know this!  *downloads x86_64 binaries*"
[02:59:15] <jan6> and the worst part is that people are actually using those packages, lol
[02:59:22] <jan6> lmao
[02:59:28] <jan6> imagine using node in the first place ;P
[02:59:41] <Bitweasil> I like to run the occasional modern chat client. :(
[02:59:51] <Bitweasil> Signal and Element (Matrix) are both Node abominations.
[03:00:36] <jan6> signal's protocol might be good, but I don't like anything else about it, lol
[03:00:41] <jan6> and matrix is horrible
[03:01:21] <jan6> as I've heard, it's not even designed as a chat platform, but as an application platform, where chat is just one of the potential apps, which then makes sense why it's such a mess
[03:01:54] <jan6> plus of course "people aren't commiting to this part of the project, we must remake this in a new language/design style then!"
[03:03:11] <Bitweasil> Signal... is exceedingly centralized, and I'm entirely unclear how much metadata is masked.
[03:03:26] <jan6> ^ part of why I don't like it
[03:03:27] <Bitweasil> Matrix is a heavy bloated pig, but it is a federated, distributed, "modern" chat client that supports multiple devices, which has some advantages.
[03:03:35] <jan6> other part is requiring a phone number for no good reason
[03:03:51] <jan6> define "modern chat"
[03:03:53] <jan6> lol
[03:03:54] <Bitweasil> On Signal?  Yeah.
[03:04:03] <jan6> nah, matrix
[03:04:18] <jan6> what advantages does matrix have over XMPP, other than "more bloat, less xml"
[03:04:22] <Bitweasil> Matrix doesn't require a phone #.
[03:04:49] <Bitweasil> Modern chat: Has iOS/Android apps that mostly work, supports multiple devices, generally "How far have people read in this room?" markers for group chat, requires several gigabytes of RAM to use.
[03:05:22] <jan6> xmpp: is decentralized, is extensible, supports several different encryption forms, has apps that work, has multi-device support, doesn't require jack sh*t resources
[03:05:32] <jan6> etc
[03:05:33] <jan6> lol
[03:05:49] <jan6> supports file uploads, clients often support image previews, etc
[03:05:54] <Bitweasil> Yeah.  I was hoping to do more with bridges on Matrix, but... eh, they're super complex to set up.
[03:05:59] <Bitweasil> I probably need to play with that more.
[03:06:08] <Bitweasil> I gave up and colo'd a box that has enough RAM to host crap now.
[03:06:20] <jan6> heh
[03:06:49] <jan6> IRC for bigger rooms, XMPP for smaller rooms and personal chats, and all's great
[03:06:53] <jan6> zulip is also great, tbh
[03:07:23] <jan6> Zulip's sadly very much invisible on the...pretty much any scheme of things, not just grand scheme of things...
[03:07:32] <Bitweasil> I've never heard of it...
[03:07:35] <jan6> exactly
[03:07:55] <jan6> https://zulip.com/
[03:08:08] <jan6> it's not exactly distributed itself, just like IRC isn't
[03:08:23] <Bitweasil> *nods*
[03:08:26] <jan6> well, it is in that you can run multiple servers, but they don't really talk with each others
[03:08:43] <jan6> its great strenght is threading
[03:09:09] <Bitweasil> Threading doesn't really matter with 4 users. :p
[03:09:16] <jan6> yeaahhh...
[03:09:21] <Bitweasil> I've got enough people I talk to on Matrix that I'll keep my server going.
[03:09:39] <jan6> why not just Matterbridge matrix ;P
[03:09:47] <Bitweasil> Hm?
[03:10:02] <jan6> https://github.com/42wim/matterbridge/
[03:10:12] <jan6> "bridge between mattermost, IRC, gitter, xmpp, slack, discord, telegram, rocketchat, twitch, ssh-chat, zulip, whatsapp, keybase, matrix, microsoft teams, nextcloud, mumble, vk and more"
[03:10:50] <jan6> idk how exactly it works with matrix, tbh
[03:10:59] <Bitweasil> Ew.
[03:11:10] <jan6> ew what?
[03:11:12] <Bitweasil> Anyway.  Matrix is... oh, if I get bridges going, it might be OK.
[03:11:15] <Bitweasil> Matterbridge.
[03:11:20] <jan6> but ew why?
[03:11:23] <Bitweasil> It bridges a lot of crap I don't want to use and generally refuse to use.
[03:11:35] <jan6> so what? just don't bridge to that crap, lol
[03:11:58] <Bitweasil> Actually, it supports Matrix.  Hm.
[03:12:02] <jan6> it seems to basically aim to support ANYTHING, you just set up the parts you want and ignore the rest
[03:12:24] <Bitweasil> Yeah.  Huh.  What's the actual client for it?
[03:12:36] <jan6> like sure, you might hate discord and shiver at the thought of MS Teams, but you can still use it to bridge your matrix, xmpp, and irc rooms together
[03:12:43] <jan6> it's a bridge, there is no client ;P
[03:13:14] <jan6> but at least the way I see it used, is usually to bridge entire rooms, so you might not get PMs through it
[03:13:27] <Bitweasil> Mostly, it turns out I don't *want* everything bridged.
[03:13:31] <Bitweasil> I use IRC during work hours.
[03:13:34] <Bitweasil> I don't use IRC at night.
[03:13:46] <Bitweasil> I chat with a few people on Matrix most of the day, but we're all high latency.
[03:13:50] <Bitweasil> And trying to use computers less.
[03:15:37] <jan6> it's getting late for me btw
[03:15:46] <Bitweasil> Yeah, I'm about out anyway.
[03:29:11] <Joanna> I prefer odysee to YouTube because it doesn’t have ads but sometimes it’s so slow that it’s unusable
[03:30:02] <jan6> imagine not using adblock
[03:30:09] * jan6 off tho
[03:35:54] <Joanna> People who want to show me ads don’t deserve to have me watch their videos
[03:36:47] <Hydragyrum> imagine not using invidious for yt
[03:36:50] <Joanna> Videos themselves are often promoting ideas as it is.
[03:37:13] <Joanna> What is invidious?
[03:37:46] <Hydragyrum> essentially a youtube proxy site, self-hostable and up at a number of sites such as yewtu.be
[03:38:14] <Hydragyrum> no ads, no tracking, just videos (and convenient download buttons)
[03:38:58] <Joanna> The last time I seriously watched YouTube was for d grayman animae. I think by now they have probably stopped all ability to watch anime for free there

[06:32:16] <joe7057> Personally I don't really mind creators having sponsor spots / ads in their videos. They do need to make money, and having sponsors etc. is a good way to earn money to support their content while still providing it free of charge to their viewers. Similar to affiliate links (so long as they do not lie about the products), since it doesn't cost the viewer anything extra. My problem with places such
[06:32:18] <joe7057> as YouTube is that they not only serve ads, but track absolutely everything you do, both on their website and, through the larger Google entity, nearly everywhere on the internet. That is the thing I personally find objectionable.

[12:58:21] <Joanna> Hi  jan6 thanks for the links.
[12:59:12] *** Joins: Matt|home (~matt@adsl-74-233-58-81.mia.bellsouth.net)
[12:59:54] <jan6> although with adblock, youtube's pretty alright too, and instead of invidious I'd probably just use vlc's or mpv's builtin youtube-dl integration, instead
[13:00:18] <Joanna> There are people who benefit  from package thieves Amazon ring comes to mind. Oh look a package thief let’s stop them by putting the entire neighborhood under surveillance and selling the data
[13:01:35] <Joanna> Package thieves are a symptom of a culture that is circling the drain.
[13:03:38] <jan6> well, they're a thing because the culture is that of owning entire house, and trusting people to not take your stuff, without having any real security/surveillance of your stuff
[13:04:34] <Joanna> If you have things being stolen it means that people are being allowed near your house who shouldn’t be and that’s definitely bad opsec.
[13:04:54] <jan6> these days, over here, there's the package automats, before that, all bigger packages just stayed at the postal office till you came after them, both of those make it pretty hard to just drive-by snatch stuff ;P
[13:06:22] <Joanna> Well if people were home and could accept the package that would certainly help. Or make appointment to have it delivered or have package lockers near homes
[13:07:23] <Joanna> But still people should not be stealing things like that regardless. I’ve had my doormat stolen before.
[13:07:51] <jan6> ^ the latter is pretty much what the package automats are here, just a wall of electronic lockerboxes
[13:08:03] <Joanna> I’ve had plants uprooted and stolen out of my yard
[13:08:25] <jan6> and courier services generally have to give it over in person too, so it shouldn't be able to be stolen easily
[13:08:39] <jan6> wtf, why would someone uproot plants
[13:09:12] <Joanna> The question is why are people who steal things allowed near homes...
[13:09:20] <jan6> and doormat seems pretty weird thing to steal too, it's not like they're expensive or especially useful (like snowshovels) anything
[13:09:33] <jan6> human society is based on trust
[13:09:41] <Joanna> People steal things
[13:09:52] <jan6> some are just kleptomaniacs, anyway
[13:10:32] <jan6> some, I assume just find "that's a cool thing, I want it, I guess I'll take it"
[13:10:44] <jan6> and some are probably just enjoying the thrill
[13:10:52] <Joanna> It’s the way neighborhoods are constructed and populated with strangers
[13:11:06] <jan6> literally everyone in the whole world is a stranger
[13:11:14] <jan6> other than a handful of people
[13:11:30] <Joanna> People once lived differently.
[13:11:31] <jan6> you literally cannot have neighborhoods that aren't populated with strangers
[13:11:58] <Joanna> It’s possible if they had a common purpose.
[13:12:00] <jan6> because once you get to know them they're not strangers, and nobody can force you to let people know you, or get you to know them
[13:12:36] <jan6> purpose doesn't matter for stranger-ness
[13:13:25] <jan6> it doesn't matter if they're a bank teller, a taxi driver, or a locksmith, they're still a stranger until you get aquintated
[13:13:27] <Joanna> People living in neighborhoods have nothing in common besides economic means and desire to live at that location
[13:15:10] <jan6> 3/5 definitions of "neighborhood" is "people living near each other", and only 1 is "having distinguishing characteristics"
[13:16:14] <jan6> economic means are often not really in common, one person might be barely able to afford the place, and another might be rich enough to own a mansion if they wanted, and both live in the same area, anyway
[13:17:50] <Joanna> The reason that people are strangers is because they don’t depend upon eachother. Historically people had to rely on people nearby for survival.
[13:18:10] <jan6> dependance doesn't matter
[13:18:20] <jan6> plenty of people have relied on strangers
[13:18:28] <Joanna> There was no money or emergency services or insurance.
[13:18:31] <jan6> especially common on internet
[13:18:51] <jan6> you don't KNOW anyone who answers you on IRC or stackexchange or whatever
[13:18:58] <jan6> you might never see them again
[13:19:11] <jan6> but you have a problem, and they try to help you, anyway
[13:19:44] <jan6> nobody should have to depend upon anyone else
[13:19:47] <Joanna> People are isolated and easy to control and it didn’t happen by accident.
[13:19:57] <jan6> people aren't easy to control
[13:20:30] <jan6> there's always a crowd of gullible people, but steering a crowd is one thing, and controlling people is another
[13:21:05] <jan6> unless you're a church or cult, it's unlikely you can really control more than a couple people
[13:21:26] <Joanna> There is no such thing as not depending on other people. Where do your utilities,stuff and food come from.did you make them all by yourself?
[13:22:03] <Joanna> People are controlled by the millions if you own the news media.
[13:22:23] <jan6> it's not people, it's people's services, which let the people themselves be interchangeable
[13:23:42] <Joanna> There will never be any rebellions because it’s so easy to kill entire regions simply by turning of utilities and stopping the food supply.
[13:23:43] <jan6> you don't care if your bread is made by Jon or Mary, you care that it's edible, you don't care if your shirt is made by Singh or Jaylee, you care that it covers you up and doesn't unravel instantly
[13:24:06] <jan6> that's not how things work yet
[13:24:16] <jan6> we don't live in such a dystopia yet
[13:24:52] <Joanna> It’s possible to do and that’s all that matters to me.
[13:25:05] <jan6> there's documentaries and stuff about places like an entire city at one place, the government left in total disrepair, not letting them be free, but also not even bothering electricity or anything
[13:25:24] <Joanna> You have to have money for bread or you don’t get any.
[13:25:34] <jan6> unless you make it yourself
[13:25:44] <jan6> also money is one thing, supply is another
[13:25:59] <jan6> turning off supply doesn't turn off money, money still circulates
[13:26:09] <Joanna> And there has to be food to buy with the money
[13:26:45] <Joanna> I can’t make bread I don’t live on a farm and niether do most other people
[13:28:24] <Joanna> It’s a precarious situation which people have been lured into because they want an easy life of luxury partially
[13:28:36] <jan6> also you're assuming people will just take it and sit and starve, too
[13:28:37] <jan6> lol
[13:28:40] <Joanna> It’s like seedless fruit.
[13:29:38] <Joanna> Well they can eat dogs and cats and then other things I suppose. But yeah most would starve to death
[13:29:52] <jan6> if you killed your own city that obviously (no supplies, and no travel in/out), people are gonna take notice, and your economy will suffer
[13:30:02] <Joanna> People sit and take a lot of things
[13:30:15] <jan6> there's always gonna be people up to making food trips around
[13:30:24] *** Quits: plankster (~plankster@user/plankers) (Quit: No Ping reply in 180 seconds.)
[13:30:30] <jan6> there's always gonna be smugglers around even when you limit travel
[13:30:47] *** Joins: plankster (~plankster@user/plankers)
[13:31:18] <Joanna> People are hundreds from their food supply in many cases
[13:31:27] <jan6> and desperate people might well strike out to rebel, too
[13:31:56] <Joanna> Also if the water supply is shut off people will be dead within a week or less
[13:32:11] <jan6> so will be the reputation of their country
[13:32:25] <jan6> also that assumes there's no rainwater
[13:32:31] <jan6> and no groundwater
[13:33:12] <Joanna> You know the British starved people in India to death by the millions. And Irish also. It’s not that hard really.
[13:33:14] <jan6> both of them can be boiled, to remove most of the contaminants, and there's always burnable stuff around
[13:33:37] <jan6> it's not hard if you're at war with them, yes
[13:33:55] <Joanna> I’m talking about places that depend upon aqueducts.
[13:34:37] <jan6> well, I don't know any such places, so can't even speculate at them
[13:34:54] <jan6> other than that they're easy to destroy, sure
[13:34:56] <Joanna> Like southern california for instance
[13:36:08] <Joanna> People don’t have situational awareness of what’s happening around them. They just assume everything is fine except for things hyped up in news media..
[13:36:27] <jan6> there's always preppers, especially in usa
[13:37:19] <jan6> of course a lot of people are blind sheep, but a lot aren't, too
[13:38:07] <jessicara> generally the function of news would be to raise such concerns, seems people are listening to national news and not local news too
[13:39:05] <jan6> of course, most mainstream media is owned by a small group of people, who can steer what is deemed important enough, too
[13:47:01] <Joanna> Preppers are useless a
[13:47:55] <Joanna> All they want to do is stockpile stuff and hide somewhere they aren’t going to make communities
[13:48:55] <Joanna> jessicara: news media is in full control of just about everything that happens
[13:49:10] <Joanna> Short of acts of god...
[13:49:59] <Joanna> What if the news media stopped pushing drugs and violence for starters..
[13:50:15] <jan6> depends on people, as does everything
[13:50:43] <Joanna> People do what the news media tells them to in most cases
[13:51:02] <jan6> there are people who try to set up communities, and have plans the entire area (such as street, or neighborhood) is aware of
[13:51:20] <jan6> most people care for themselves first, of course
[13:51:41] <jan6> and most people assume authority figures don't betray them
[13:51:55] <Joanna> People who seriously try to set up their own communities get literally destroyed
[13:52:04] <jan6> you can't speak unilaterally
[13:52:08] <jan6> you are not the world
[13:53:02] <jan6> it definitely heavily depends on the other people, if they're mindless, or not, if they feel you're crazy, or if they'll play along just in case, etc
[13:53:17] <Joanna> I know of religious people who were harrassed and community destroyed. Independent communities are definitely not allowed so far as I know
[13:53:22] <jan6> of course MOST people aren't gonna bother doing anything outside their tiny comfort zone
[13:53:34] <jan6> independent communities are definitely allowed
[13:53:56] <Joanna> Yep they are selfish and want luxury.
[13:54:04] <jan6> problem is though that yeah, you'll likely get harrassed, and will need to be quite determined
[13:55:07] <jan6> and if you want to have a commune or whatnot, it might get a little tricky legally in the sense of, someone's supposed to "own" the ground, etc, but there's stories of some that survive well
[13:55:14] <Joanna> I don’t know of any people who have independent communities at all. Where are they?
[13:55:24] <jan6> not in cities, of course
[13:55:47] <jan6> what about https://www.ic.org/directory/communes/
[13:56:16] <jan6> you can filter by state/country
[13:56:17] <Joanna> How determined can you be when thugs show up and kidnap all your kids. That will end your community quickly.
[13:56:47] <jan6> but if USA has 773 listed communes, then it definitely is "a thing"
[13:57:10] <Joanna> Forming :)
[13:57:12] <jan6> if everywhere had thugs who kidnapped all your kids, there'd be <100
[13:57:13] <jan6> lol
[13:57:33] <jan6> https://www.ic.org/directory/listings/?filters=established&&country=United%20States
[13:57:40] <jan6> Showing 459 communities.
[13:57:50] <jan6> 450 established ones ;P
[13:58:23] <jan6> some are 10+ years
[13:58:25] <Joanna> I’ve never seen an intentional community before
[13:58:46] <jan6> of course
[13:58:53] <jan6> if you did, then all the jackasses would, too
[13:59:05] <jan6> they're rare, for sure
[13:59:09] <jan6> but they're definitely a thing
[14:02:25] <jan6> not every place has your thugs
[14:02:42] <jan6> not everywhere has serious criminal presence

[14:36:54] *** Joins: g00fy78 (~g00fy@user/g00fy)
[14:39:00] <Joanna> So far as I know everything is controlled by government regulations more or less . For instance in the us the Mormons were being persecuted and went off into the wilderness and created Salt Lake City and not long after that the government annexed their homeland and was sending the men to prison for having more than one wife which is allowed in their religion.
[14:42:19] <Joanna> Most people don’t even have the resources or group cohesiveness to get a large tract of land and build a self governed town but when they do they get stopped.
[14:43:43] <Joanna> I am a big fan of self governing communities like the kibbutzim in the early days of Israel for instance.
