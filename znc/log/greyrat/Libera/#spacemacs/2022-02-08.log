[06:51:37] <FromGitter> <PatrickCPE> Hey, could anyone help me with configuring autocomplete for my python layer.

[09:05:52] <bobdobbs> Hi all. I installed spacemacs recently. I'm now having issues with packages. Spacemacs suddenly couldn't find dap-mode. So I uninstalled it. As soon as I did that and restarted, spacemacs started throwing an error indicating that it couldn't find yasnippet mode... which I also know that I installed
[09:25:59] <bobdobbs> I've also hit another issue. After restarting spacemacs, it's switched to the vi editing style. How do I switch back to the emacs style?
[09:27:16] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> it's likely that parentheses are unbalanced after you edited .spacemacs
[09:28:09] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> Given that last time I saw your .spacemacs I told you that you've put invalid lisp expressions.
