[00:10:13] <auctus> no it (ardour) doesnt i dont think, thats the only reason i tried it at all 
[00:10:42] <auctus> i think the version included with ubuntu studio is more up to date than the regular ubuntu one, i tried both, both are unintuitive, seem to include no plugins, do weird stuff with Jack
[00:11:03] <auctus> i can pause lmms and do other stuff; but i have to turn off Ardour completely to get sound out of any other application
[00:11:30] <auctus> and it made some horrible noise out of my laptop speakers that wouldnt shut off until i powered off the laptop, even though i had hheadphone audio on
[00:11:36] <auctus> for no apparent reason.
[00:12:21] <auctus> literally every other piece of software i tried required just about no setup

[00:32:18] <artao> at least their shit sounds damn good ;p
[00:32:31] <louipc> gotta have that :D
[00:33:09] <artao> so yeah. the dude i bought this from had the ProMars via monthly Roland Cloud
[00:33:15] <artao> he hadn't just outright bought it
[00:33:38] <artao> But it's still on the Sys 1M so I get to have and use it even without using Roland Cloud
[00:33:43] <artao> which is nice i guess
[00:33:56] <artao> 99usd to outright buy
[00:34:31] <artao> so if i buy another plugout, i'd have to purchase the promars myself to put it back on the sys 1m
[00:35:04] <artao> of the 4 available tho, the promars is prolly the best one. the others are the SH-101, SH-2, and System 100
[00:35:27] <MusicalDillo> The System 100 was a cool little modular

[04:49:34] <auctus> on the piano roll in lmms, what does "1/16th" mean? it changes the resolution of uh... the music notes
[04:50:01] <auctus> 1/16th of what
[04:50:55] <artao> a 1/16th note, as opposed to a 1/4 not or whole note etc
[04:51:11] <artao> it's 1/16 of one note
[04:51:15] <artao> speed
[04:51:46] <artao> there is also T and D
[04:51:55] <artao> T means triplet and D means dotted 1/8th
[04:52:29] <artao> er ... a dotted note. whichever. 1/16D or 1/8D etc
[04:52:45] <artao> "dotted" means you hold it just a little longer. gives it some "swing"
[04:53:02] <artao> a triplet is three notes in the same time as 4. again, gives it some swing
[04:53:24] <artao> this is all regarding 4/4 time

[04:54:03] <artao> all that ... replace "note" with "beat"

[05:05:24] <macrobat> yes, typically
[05:05:36] <louipc> 4/4 and 3/4 are most common time signatures
[05:06:00] <louipc> but that starts to get a bit boring if you a real music geek
[05:06:07] <louipc> and thats basically all pop music
[05:06:57] <macrobat> 6/8 typically has a different feel than 3/4. you can't reduce your fractions

[22:20:07] <macrobat> yes

[22:29:52] <nativetexan> i like this song
[22:30:36] <macrobat> Digit: but what shall the lumpenproles listen to?
[22:32:00] <macrobat> the left one is playing the strings really hard
[22:35:02] <nativetexan> well over 4 million views
[22:35:54] <Digit> ... starting to suspect this directory's like a whole album i had intended to release, then lost and forgot about it, in the fray of stresses around 2017.   at least 3 tracks here, as better(~) versions of released.  
[22:36:43] <macrobat> versioning is hard
[22:37:22] <nativetexan> 2017 was stressful for me too
[22:37:26] <Digit> "it's not linear."
[22:39:24] <Digit> 2017 and there arounds' stresses lead me to say : i've envied gregor samsa's lot.
[22:39:38] <Digit> and yet still i managed to squeeze out a few albums around then.
[22:40:01] <Digit> ... making more music, in desperation, as therapy.

[22:49:48] <Digit> was just thinking i could do with a soak in that.  feelin too dry.
[22:50:34] <Digit> ... and as i listen to the dry scratchy husky sound of this track fade out... i wonder if/howmuch dry or wet sounds affect the biology/hydration/senses in that way
[22:51:52] <nativetexan> good question
[22:52:29] <Digit> end of my rambles about that mystery old directory of better track versions... playlist switching to... :)  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=510PKLSuyQY (if i typed that correct).

[23:06:59] <nativetexan> it's showing winds in real time?
[23:07:32] <Digit> lots more data fed into it to play around with and display, than just wind.
