[17:29:12] <FromGitter> <dkovacevic15> Hi, I have problem in Spacemacs, and I have no idea how to begin solving it. I am working in Python using pyenv, specifically pyenv-virtualenv. I have a .python-version file that Spacemacs was picking up fine yesterday. Today, LSP stuff works, but the integrated terminal doesn't respect pyenv, despite it being in the $PATH.

[21:24:29] <FromGitter> <passeride> Hello, i have a problem with the "Spacemacs" buffer overwriting the "top" org buffer on startup, or appending the content of the spacemacs splash screen to the org file, marking it dirty and also changing the mode of the buffer
