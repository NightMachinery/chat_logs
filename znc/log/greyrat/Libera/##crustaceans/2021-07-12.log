[08:40:31] <jjuran> According to a completely baseless and unverified rumor, Steve Jobs wanted to be the seventh astronaut on the ill-fated Challenger mission in 1986
[08:40:58] <jjuran> I would love to read the alternate historical fiction about that :-)
[08:52:55] <quanticle> Challenger blew up in 1986. That's too early. They should have blown up Steve Jobs while he was at NeXT
[08:53:45] <quanticle> Then we could have had the alternate history where 1) Copeland was a real thing and 2) where Steve Jobs didn't return to Apple and Apple never went down the path of locking everything down and turning things into iDevices
[08:56:36] <jjuran> One branch along that tree is that Apple bases Mac OS X on BeOS
[08:56:58] <jjuran> Another is that Apple gets bought by Sun, which becomes Oracle
[08:57:02] <jjuran> :-(
[08:58:39] <jjuran> quanticle: Jobs left Apple in 1985
[09:00:01] <quanticle> Really? That early? Wait, when did the original Macintosh come out?
[09:00:32] <quanticle> Oh, it came out in 1984.
[09:00:48] <quanticle> Oh, well, in that case, I'm totally down for this alternate history.
[09:01:13] <quanticle> Also, maybe if Sun had bought Apple, the combined company would have survived.
[09:01:33] <quanticle> Unlikely, I know, but that's the point of alternate history: to explore what could have been, no matter how unlikely.

[11:10:46] <gerikson> https://stallman.org/archives/2021-may-aug.html#11_July_2021_(Declining_birth_rates)
[11:10:55] <gerikson> ``I disagree with one point. I think we need to reduce the human population more than 20% per generation. If in the short term that leads to somewhat less quality of life, by the 22nd century it will enable us to distress Earth's natural ecosystems.''
[11:14:14] <quanticle> More than 20% per generation means that humanity will be extinct long before we reach the 22nd Century
[11:14:49] <quanticle> Also, if 20% of humanity dies over the period of a generation, that means civilizational collapse, basically
[11:15:03] <quanticle> Like, forget software, you'll be lucky to retain electricity
[11:15:04] <gerikson> hey, math is hard!
[11:16:11] <gerikson> and ofc he's Assange-curious https://stallman.org/archives/2021-may-aug.html#10_July_2021_(Danger_of_prosecuting_news_publishers)
[11:16:53] <quanticle> Him being Assange-curious doesn't surprise me.
[11:17:20] <quanticle> Also, what exactly *is* the case against Assange, now, anyway? Weren't the rape charges dropped?
[11:18:13] <quanticle> I've never been clear as to what he's supposed to be guilty of other than various Western governments vaguely gesturing in his direction, saying he's a bad dude, trust us, we know what we're talking about, we wouldn't lie to you now, would we?
[11:19:06] <gerikson> the sexual assault charges were a "sideshow", the reason they got traction was that Assange and his supporters thought that if he was in Swedish custody he'd be extradited to the US
[11:20:08] <gerikson> ``The US indictment accused Assange of conspiracy to commit computer intrusion by helping US Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning gain access to privileged information, which Assange intended to publish on Wikileaks. The charge was less serious than those levelled against Manning, and carries a maximum sentence of five years with a possibility of parole.''
[11:20:25] <quanticle> Right, which just seems incredibly vindictive to me
[11:20:28] <gerikson> ok he could deffo have been extradited from Sweden for that
[11:20:55] <gerikson> `` 23 May 2019, a US grand jury added 17 espionage charges related to his involvement with Chelsea Manning, making a total of 18 federal charges against Assange in the US. The 18 charges could result in a sentence of up to 175 years in prison.''
[11:20:59] <quanticle> Assange didn't hack anything. He published a bunch of stuff that Chelsea Manning gave him
[11:21:11] <quanticle> And Chelsea Manning is already in jail
[11:21:12] <gerikson> I doubt the charges will stick
[11:21:22] <gerikson> yeah she got shafted :P
[11:22:29] <gerikson> semi-related, I found the comments on this piece, both here and on HN, incredibly fatuous https://gerikson.com/hnlo/#kto6kn_27797035

[11:23:02] <gerikson> sure he lost access to his computers but he did an incredibly sketchy thing
[11:23:28] <gerikson> if you read the linked article he seems mostly mad he didn't get to comment on the story when it was posted online
[11:24:07] <gerikson> correct me if I'm wrong, but if LEO shows up wiht a warrant, even if you have a lawyer they're still gonna take your stuff
[11:24:12] <quanticle> Yep
[11:24:20] <quanticle> They can always take your stuff
[11:24:52] <gerikson> giving them your password might have been dumb
[11:26:37] <quanticle> Yeah, well, it depends. Passwords aren't always covered by the 5th Amendment. But definitely giving cops your password *before* talking to a lawyer is dumb.
[11:27:28] <gerikson> kicker: dude didn't have a lawyer ;)
