[00:14:25] <FernandoChu[m]> `StateT s m a` is a functor as long as `m` is a functor, similarly with monads. If `m` is an Applicative does that implies that `StateT s m a` is Applicative too?
[00:17:02] <jackdk> % :info StateT

[00:17:55] <jackdk> `instance [safe] forall (m :: * -> *) s. (Functor m, Monad m) => Applicative (StateT s m) -- Defined in `Control.Monad.Trans.State.Lazy'` Guess not, but probably for historical reasons.
[00:18:04] <geekosaur> interestingly it seems to require (Functor m, Monad m) which sounds like a holdover from pre-AMP

[00:18:42] <FernandoChu[m]> yep, that's why I'm wondering if that's just an unnecessary (historic) constraint
[00:19:04] <geekosaur> Monad implies Functor so the extra constraint is pointless, yes
[00:19:17] <geekosaur> the question is whether it should be Application =>
[00:19:21] <geekosaur> erApplicative
[00:19:35] <FernandoChu[m]> not that, I meant Monad implies Applicative too, so wondering if Applicative is enough
[00:19:38] <FernandoChu[m]> yeah that
[00:20:17] <geekosaur> right, but as these constraints predate that too, I think it's just an oversight

[06:16:53] <freeman42x[m]> Unicorn_Princess: isn't the indentation done by the editor/IDE based on whatever you set it to be tabs/spaces/size ? I am not aware of HLS doing anything regards indentation unless maybe you are asking about linting?

[09:19:39] <Guest89> Hi, beginner question here: I am using Haskell-src-exts analysing Github projects I've scraped. However when parsing them with 'parseFile', I get tons of ParseErrors in repos which compile just fine when I clone them. The Errors mostly concern missing language extensions and advise to add a corresponding pragma. Am I using the wrong function? I
[09:19:40] <Guest89> thought 'parseFile' should respect language pragmas?
[09:21:09] <freeman42x[m]> Guest89: language pragma's can also be declared globally in a cabal file, that might be cause of the issue
[09:29:09] <Guest89> freeman42x[m]: Thanks! At least for some of the errors that seems to be the case. Do you perchance know any lib which can parse cabal files since haskell-src-exts can't do that?

[10:59:15] <freeman42x[m]> <sm> "https://github.com/ndmitchell/..." <- that is close, what I meant is to provide a REPL eg. GHCI and when saving a file the last command you run in the repl will be rerun. This is what ide-haskell-repl Atom extension does and it is very useful. Can't find anything like it for VSCode though, nor external application
[10:59:43] <freeman42x[m]> `ghcid -t` says it is for `Set window topmost (Windows only)`

[11:14:21] <dminuoso> maerwald[m]: Yes.
[11:15:25] <dminuoso> Postfix configuration generally is not that complicated if you make a few design decisions.
[11:16:21] <dminuoso> rspamd and dovecot are way more complicated in terms of how you usually configure them
[11:16:29] <dminuoso> If you make use of these 
[11:16:40] *** Quits: [itchyjunk] (~itchyjunk@user/itchyjunk/x-7353470) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[11:18:07] <dminuoso> But yeah, we feel very comfortable this works out nicer with nix. For instance, we have a base profile that configures `services.postfix.config.disable_vrfy_command = true;`, so every postfix we have in our infrastructure has VRFY disabled by default. And this profile is composable with other settings, it's small things like this that are very expressible with nixos.
[11:19:34] <dminuoso> And we have some pretty sleek automatism to generate multiplexed prometheus exporters on each server, and the nix code generates a discovery.json that gives us automatic service discovery.
[11:19:55] <dminuoso> So we just have to turn on `services.postfix.enable = true;` on any server, and it will automatigally be included by our monitoring
[11:20:17] <dminuoso> Anyway. Not trying to convince you it's great which Im sure you disagree with.

[17:38:21] <geekosaur> cabal has -w. cabal's assumption is you have standardized on one ghc version and it adapts to that, rather than the ghc version being picked per project
[17:38:56] <geekosaur> this isn't always ideal, since you don;t have any say in what version of `base` is used with that compiler
[17:39:06] *** Quits: Erutuon (~Erutuon@user/erutuon) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[17:39:32] <geekosaur> also, you can get from  stackage a cabal freeze file which serves many of the purposes of a resolver
[17:40:06] <dminuoso> But you can address this with very minor overhead of setting up `ghc` and `cabal` using a) nix-shell, b) direnv, some other mechanism
[17:40:58] <dminuoso> so Im a cabal user, and every project has at least some 10 line shell.nix to set up ghc, cabal and libraries at specific versions needed for that project

[19:41:56] <freeman42x[m]> I'm trying to figure out how to use the more typesafe API from this code: https://github.com/puffnfresh/fp-course/blob/twitch/projects/TicTacToe/Main.hs The version with more compile time guarantees would be using Move1, Move2, etc. instead of MainMoves which is currently used in run function. The reason I don't understand how to use the api via Move1, Move2 etc. is because I can't figure out any way to use those types in a recursive
[19:41:56] <freeman42x[m]> function (or equiv), since on first loop I'd try to construct Move1, in a later loop Move2 etc. I think this issue might be solved by dependent types, no idea how else. Also I can't figure out how exactly it would be implemented anyway. I hope I explained clearly enough why I don't know how to use the API via Move1, Move2, etc., kind of struggling to put in a clea way the issue I have with solving it

[20:24:53] <freeman42x[m]> seems that to get more compile time safety typically leads to writing more  code. Which makes me wonder if or when is that even worth it. Substantially more code is much more likely to lead to it having bugs. The Move1, Move2 etc. code for the case above could be fully replaced with 1 runtime condition I think (total valid moves always <= 9)
[20:25:40] <geekosaur> but typelevel mitigates the bugs aspect: if it compiles it'sfar more likely to be correct
[20:26:20] <merijn> freeman42x[m]: IMO fancy type-y things are like spices "a little can go a long way" :p
[20:26:27] <geekosaur> that said,in general yes, dependent types or even haskell type-level fake dependent types means a lot more code and a lot more annoyance to keep the compiler happy
[20:26:57] <sm> and the turmeric will stain everything
[20:27:14] <geekosaur> the original paper ondoing typelevelin haskell was called "hasochism" for a reason :)
[20:27:25] <freeman42x[m]> geekosaur: of course, my point is that it's a tradeoff because by writing more code to make code more compile time safe you are writing more code which can lead to more bugs because it's most stuff that could possibly go wrong
[20:28:09] <fendor> komikat, Essentially, you write a proposal what you want to work on, how you plan to tackle it, etc...

[20:33:13] <freeman42x[m]> geekosaur: I am not sure that is the case. Look at this code: https://github.com/puffnfresh/fp-course/blob/01dff1f47424fc2e724a969e44a92ee0c5a30f71/projects/TicTacToe/Main.hs#L38-L76 There are so many ways to make mistakes in it which would not be caught at compile time. For example: setBoardPosition P1 a (Board _ b c d e f g h i) =   Board a b b d e f g h i So there are countless ways where a simple typo could completely break the
[20:33:13] <freeman42x[m]> program without any compile time warning yet the only benefit (as far as I can tell) is just the fact that Board limits at compile time all the possible positions to be exactly 9

[21:07:44] <freeman42x[m]> geekosaur: the goal is to get compile time errors yes, that is not what I am asking or questioning. I am asking how would you know whether using compile time bug catching code won't in average introduce more runtime bugs than compile time bugs it catches. Note that in that example above it introduces way more possible runtime bugs than compile time guarantees, even though there is a better solution which you mentioned and does not have
[21:07:44] <freeman42x[m]> this issue. Let's say a developer could somehow always write "good" compile time checked code. Will that: never introduce new runtime bugs? sometimes introduce new runtime bugs? tbh. I doubt this is an easy question

[21:32:29] <geekosaur> it's fuzzy. my guideline for typelevel is use of the "singletons" library (or manual defunctionalization which probably ought to be done with singletones instead)
[21:32:35] <geekosaur> *singletons
[21:33:58] <geekosaur> in particular I don't regard smart "ordinary" (non-defunctionalization) use of types to be type level programming for the most part

[21:37:03] <Franciman> haskell tries really hard to get you things, with its zillion of ghc extensions, but idris and agda given their naturally more powerful type system, give you those things and more in a cleaner way
[21:37:04] <geekosaur> I'm actually inclined to agree. Idris is often a good place to start on typelevel programming if you already know Haskell
[21:37:09] <Franciman> so it's like coding in C++ or in Haskell
[21:37:16] <Franciman> except that now Haskell is C++, and Idris is Haskell
