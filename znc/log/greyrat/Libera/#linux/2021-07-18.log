[02:18:26] <VG9t>            command is asynchronous; it will return after the power-off operation is enqueued, without waiting for it to complete.
[02:18:26] <VG9t>            If combined with --force, shutdown of all running services is skipped, however all processes are killed and all file systems are unmounted or mounted read-only, immediately followed by the

[02:27:02] <Wafficus`> why can't there be a guide with minimal overhead, geez. Why can't I win
[02:27:17] <Psi-Jack> Wafficus`: Just depends entirely on what you want/need in your total setup.
[02:27:41] <Psi-Jack> If you want anti-virus/malware scanning on email, you'll need 4GB RAM, period.
[02:27:59] <Wafficus`> I just realized it because I restarted nginx since modoboa uses it as its backend for the web interface and saw the OOM issues because of the ClamAV and Amavis dependencies

[06:36:48] <onelegend> Scarecr0w: their no logs policy has been evaluated in the real world. One time the feds raided one of their servers and found nothing because they don't keep logs.
[06:36:48] <Kyv> so youd might as well just pick one
[06:36:59] <onelegend> so expressvpn is actually fine as a VPN provider

[07:41:51] <Psi-Jack> generally speaking, for networked filesystems such as gluster, you're dealing with a static set of hosts under literally 100% of the time. Should a server fail, you could have a VIP float to a new host, if need-be, or take the old server out and make anew, using the same IP.

[09:23:17] <Izem> autopsy: what should I look for here?
[09:23:27] <mlu> it's when your disk needs to go to the service-mart :)

[09:23:47] <mlu> or an alert system for when you should be smarting from data loss and out-of-warranty disks
[09:23:53] <LambdaComplex> i got a new Western Digital datacenter drive ("Hitachi/HGST Ultrastar 7K2") and it has a SMART attribute named "Gas_Gauge"
[09:24:00] <LambdaComplex> what the eff does "Gas_Gauge" mean
[09:24:35] <mlu> LambdaComplex: maybe something about when it's ready to fart?
[09:24:49] <mlu> LambdaComplex: seriously though: I imagine it has to do with pressure monitoring

[11:43:26] <Izem> yep
[11:43:42] <Izem> make /home a partition

[11:44:27] <autopsy> I wouldn't.
[11:44:36] *** Parts: tomf (tomf@our.lady.of.perpetual.faith) ()
[11:44:45] <Izem> distros don't usually leave /home alone so it's probably not worth it
[11:44:53] <Izem> unless you are installing a bunch of distros
[11:44:55] <autopsy> I would make a home for sall of them since they all have different versions of software your configs will be useless here and screweing up the applications there.
[11:45:10] <Izem> you can share /boot/efi too
[11:45:28] <autopsy> Put /var on an NFS partition.
[11:45:35] <Daemonick> autopsy so this is risky to mess things, right?
[11:46:15] <autopsy> Daemonick, it is actually yes. If you just want to save your files, make a /pub and mount it to a USB flash stick or something or an extra drive.
[11:46:24] <Daemonick> Well I will divide the physical HDD by the number of distros
[11:46:41] <Daemonick> And do some labeling
[11:46:46] <autopsy> So 4MB per root filesystem?
[11:47:02] <Sauvin> I would establish different directories for /home for different directories in a multiboot situation. Distros tend to run different versions of different things and config files may get confused.

[11:48:34] <Rashad> autopsy: ok so "printf "%s\n" "http_caching=packages" >> /etc/yum.conf" will work for 1 and I think also for 2, except that 2 won't be created yet

[14:08:07] <biopsy> hexnewbie, I didn't read that yeah corrupt packages by insane amounts of retransmissions on a wireless link for example on a channel that is saturated will cause yum metadata to come throiiugh until it is not corrupt and those are summed.
[14:08:34] <Rashad> This simply means it will install an old version instead of a newer version... no?
[14:08:56] <biopsy> Rashad, yeah thats how long before the yum metadata it gets from the toplevel SRPMS/repo/comps.xml etc .gz .bz2 .xz files are downloaded again to recheck for new packages.

I'm used to arch and I never used pop before... do you know why it's so popular ? I think i'll install manjaro...
[16:08:15] <tonitch> and second question... do you recommend xfce or kde for newbies ?

[16:20:12] <kurahaupo_> randomuser: There is a debate. In my opinion anything that's not the "purpose" of the program should go to stderr, including help messages. Some people think that because you've asked for the help output, then that's its purpose at that time, but I think that's stretching the point too far
[16:20:59] <HumbleGuy> kurahaupo_, i don't get it, what is "check $( tty )"?
[16:21:01] <kurahaupo_> My point being that stderr isn't just about "errors"
[16:21:14] <HumbleGuy> should i replace tty with /dev/tty1?

[20:09:33] <autopsy> bryan, look at the very end block from like 50 lines back from the bottom.
[20:09:50] <autopsy> bryan, see that?
[20:09:51] <bryan> EAGAIN (Resource temporarily unavailable) this?
[20:09:56] <Psi-Jack> Well, gotta say, I like the Garuda boot splash, and grub setup. Not such a fan of the rainbow coloring of Gnome. heh
[20:09:58] <bryan> towards the bottom the poll function calls?
[20:10:02] <autopsy> bryan, yes thats part of it.
[20:10:07] <autopsy> The poll yes.
[20:10:16] <autopsy> Poll is an IRQ CPU cycle call.
[20:10:36] <autopsy> The CPU gives up 1 complete cycle per IRQ POLL request.
[20:11:16] <autopsy> bryan, you can clearly see that its stuck on a loop of polling.
[20:11:17] <bryan> I see a bit above that setpriority(PRIO_PROCESS, 594, -1)      = -1 EACCES (Permission denied)
[20:11:26] <autopsy> Yep.
[20:11:34] <autopsy> Yep. bryan keep looking.
[20:11:40] <Psi-Jack> Oh, and the broken dns for a garuda-specific repository is not a good sign at all. LOL

[23:47:50] <kfrench> tonitch: If that's just kernels and misc config/support files, then 512meg is still plenty
[23:48:07] <autopsy> 256MB ios plenty for Fedora 34.
[23:48:14] <tonitch> wow, usualy my home need 500G and it's always full

[23:49:55] <autopsy> Why have a /boot dedicated primary partition taking up valuable MBR table when you can have /root /var /usr /etc?

[23:50:22] <msiism> tonitch: Maybe it's good to keep them on a dedicated partition then, like aeparate from all the important stuff.
[23:50:24] <tonitch> and what about the swap ?
[23:50:37] <autopsy> SWAP is the smae size as your pohysical RAM.
[23:50:45] <Psi-Jack> autopsy: Obviously, at 246M currently now, 256MB is not sufficient. 😛

[23:51:33] <Psi-Jack> try English.
[23:51:42] <tonitch> that's what I did for my last pc but here i'm installing manjaro for my mom who is a full time photographer
[23:52:05] <autopsy> Photos is like 5MB per 8 megapixel 1024x768

[23:52:50] <msiism> tonitch: As a partitioning scheme for desktop use, I like /boot, /, and /home.

[23:53:40] <autopsy> Gimp her to me.
[23:53:45] <tonitch> don't know... she use this format and I know it's heavy
[23:54:20] <Psi-Jack> I have a /boot partition because my / is btrfs.

[23:54:52] <[[R]]> i can't belive its not butter!
[23:55:12] * msiism still uses ext2 for /boot.
[23:55:19] * esselfe formats [[R]] to btrfs
[23:55:46] * [[R]] can't remember the last time he had a separate /boot
[23:56:14] <esselfe> I always put everything in /
[23:56:25] *** Joins: moxie (~moxie@user/moxie)
[23:56:26] <esselfe> only 1 partition
[23:56:32] <esselfe> ok 2 with the swap
[23:56:49] <msiism> Separate /boot has some adavntages. I'm trying to remember them now.
[23:56:55] <esselfe> one or two of my servers have a swapfile instead
[23:57:03] <[[R]]> lol
[23:57:08] <[[R]]> i'll wait
[23:57:21] <msiism> Like, you can unmount /boot when the system is running, for "better security", which I don't do.

[23:57:35] <[[R]]> what type of security does that provide?
[23:57:49] <msiism> Also, the classic way of doing "full" disk encryption requires a separate unencrypted /boot partition.
[23:57:50] <esselfe> yeah it could be remounted rw

[23:58:24] <[[R]]> msiism: what type of attack is goign to be launched if /boot is mounted?
[23:58:40] <msiism> I'd have to look that up.

[23:59:00] <msiism> Also, when multibooting, several systems could use the same /boot partition. I'm not sure whether that makes good sense, but i've heard it's possible.
