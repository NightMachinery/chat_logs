[07:39:25] <PMT> Doesn't that also implicitly mean they could lose money by not upgrading?
[07:39:29] <luke-jr> yes
[07:39:57] <luke-jr> but installing the old version was something they did already themselves
[07:40:35] <PMT> Doesn't that imply you should pop up this warning literally every upgrade though? I could see that getting problematic quickly.
[07:41:08] <luke-jr> most upgrades don't change the rules
[07:41:17] <PMT> Yes, but warning them that future ones might.

[07:43:09] <syphix> Anyone know if its still possible to upgrade to latest version of Debian from Debian 8.1 using the command line?
[07:43:25] <luke-jr> it's not quite the situation where I'm involved in the loss
[07:43:49] <PMT> I would probably go 9 then 10 unless I were feeling exciting, personally. 
[07:44:06] <PMT> But I'm just some other random person in an IRC room, not anyone authoritative.
[07:44:22] <syphix> PMT: so its possible to upgrade to 9 still from command line
[07:44:57] <syphix> Im pretty sure you have to do it that way anyway
[07:45:13] <PMT> I haven't tried it recently, but the only reason I could imagine it being broken is if the repo signatures expired, and I don't imagine they have. (And if they have, there are ways around that.)
[07:45:35] <syphix> going to try now
[07:45:52] <PMT> (or if they were so old they moved to only being on archive., but we're a while from that. ;) )
[07:46:23] <syphix> oh I thought it might have been like that
[07:47:05] <syphix> I have some Debian 7 I need to upgrade too
[07:48:11] <PMT> I believe oldoldstable gets to hang out in the normal mirrors. So I am not an all-knowing oracle, but my expectation is that 8+9+10 will be available in the usual places until 11 becomes stable, then 8 will fall off the wagon.

Same arch, same release, same command, same packages installed.
[09:03:21] <PMT> The reason you in particular may be amused is the underlying cause I eventually found. I had apparently, for some reason lost to time, overwritten the keyring file being referenced with something else sometime in the past.
[09:04:51] <themill> oops

[14:09:47] <dpkg> Now Debian "Bullseye" is the current testing branch as of 2019-07-06 and it will be released "when it's ready." Release day we're working to currently - as discussed in various mailing lists is July 31st 2021. There's a hard freeze from July 17th with only the most urgent security fixes after that date. Stuff may slip but July 31 is hoped for.

[16:39:47] <ulu> ratrace, ok it is good to know.  I will try the tarball then.
[16:40:32] <ratrace> ulu: I unpack it under /opt/pycharm/pycharm-<version>  and then symlink its bin/pycharm.sh to ~/bin/pycharm . it's all I need to do to run it.
[16:40:35] <uoj6wz6qoswb> its a load of scripts to build ephemeral isos using gentoo so not overly relevent to debian just lurking for the linux questions
[16:41:13] <ulu> ratrace, btw do you adjust the JVM heapsize? I am on a machine with only 8GB RAM
[16:41:36] <ratrace> I never needed any tuning, even when I had only 8GB RAM

[17:12:44] <ulu> will pycharm then use pip to install packages only inside the virtual environment?
[17:14:03] <ratrace> ulu: I think it does that, yes. I manage my virtualenvs manually, and only tried "project settings" "interpreter" settings once or twice
[17:14:12] *** Joins: JohnML (~JohnML@ip-37-201-129-30.hsi13.unitymediagroup.de)
[17:14:43] <ratrace> ulu: at the very least you can assign a virtualenv to your project via settings; it can create one or you can create it manually; and then all packages are installed and managed into the virtualenv
[17:15:17] <ulu> ah ok. I am wondering where I should create my virtual env folder, within a specific python project directory or in a "central" place in my home folder 
[17:16:00] <ulu> so that several projects can share the same libraries installed once in the virtual env.
[17:16:41] <ratrace> ulu: wherever you want. you can have a ~/virtualenvs/  grouped togehter, or in the project dir.  I keep a .virtulenv inside the project dir, I don't share virtualenvs between them
[17:17:40] <ulu> ok, thanx I will try this set up then.

[21:20:48] <velix> ratrace: challenge accepted.

[21:21:10] <velix> ratrace: and it should smell like butter ;)
[21:21:12] <ratrace> when that init/process manager is made, and tested, I'll be all ears.
[21:21:28] <randall> !why systemd
[21:21:28] <dpkg> a tired argument.  Start by reading rra's excellent analysis at https://lists.debian.org/debian-ctte/2013/12/msg00234.html  Support for other init systems (sysvinit) is still present in Debian 8-10.  systemd-shim allows userspace requiring some systemd APIs to work without it.  See <jessie sysvinit> if you have to delay or wish to avoid using it.
[21:21:35] <ratrace> velix: well these are the features I'm extensively using and a replacement system would HAVE to have them
[21:21:51] <ratrace> oh yes and cgroup resource management. 
[21:23:43] <ratrace> I'll also need an indexed syslog which I can easily query with options like -u, --since and --until, as grep is not capable of that on pure text files.
[21:24:22] <shtrb> ratrace, then use your sane db interface that already exist in rsyslog
[21:24:30] <craigevil> ,v ncdu
[21:24:31] <judd> Package: ncdu on amd64 -- jessie: 1.10-1; stretch: 1.12-1+b1; buster: 1.13-1+b1; bullseye: 1.15.1-1; sid: 1.15.1-1
[21:24:33] <shtrb> no need for that to be in the init system
[21:24:57] <ratrace> I never said it has to be. I'm sayin what I want in a systemd replacement.
[21:25:12] <randall> TBF journald is a service that is not part of PID1.
[21:25:29] <ratrace> I thought it was?
[21:25:46] <ratrace> ah indeed, systemd-journald, not pid 1
[21:26:21] <shtrb> ratrace, there's no reason to have an init system that implement a logging system, we have several syslog systems that already work very well 
[21:26:22] <randall> `systemctl status systemd-journald.service` tells me it's PID 559 on my systemd.
[21:26:36] <ratrace> yeah 1090 currently here
[21:27:03] <ratrace> shtrb: I agree. systems is not an init system tho. it's a process manager and middleware, that also happens to have pid1 functionality.

[21:27:39] <velix> randall: journald and timesyncd are (on bullseye)
[21:27:54] <randall> ... and network-manager isn't even part of systemd, so no idea why that got listed there.
[21:27:57] <shtrb> We already had all these "middlare" implemented properly in the past, systemd spawn it's claws on all possible things

[21:28:46] <ratrace> shtrb: yes because it wants to be a single project for all the "OS building blocks" as they call them. you can still run chrony, unbind, ifupdown...... systemd did not kill those nor does it prevent them from running.

[23:52:24] <cpach> hi folks. so i'm currently fighting systemd. can't get webhook from the webhook package running.
[23:52:37] <cpach> could someone please take a look at this config? https://paste.debian.net/1203062/
[23:53:02] <cpach> does it look sane?

[23:53:22] <PMT> You didn't mention how it's failing.
[23:53:53] <cpach> PMT: correct. i don't seem to get any output currently.
[23:54:02] <cpach> PMT: if you have the time, please have a look at the paste
[23:54:28] <PMT> journalctl -xe says nothing at all?
