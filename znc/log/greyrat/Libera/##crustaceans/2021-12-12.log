[00:01:05] <manicennui> What about Thor's hammer?
[00:01:19] <edk> maybe hammers are closer then
[00:01:43] <manicennui> I should learn more about Nordic religion. It seems more entertaining.

[01:50:30] <mouseghost> there was some contest like that too
[01:55:08] <cb> eve is free bc you can buy subs with in game currency
[01:55:14] <cb> just means you need to be sufficiently good at it

[01:56:38] <mouseghost> yeams
[01:56:40] <mouseghost> i think
[01:56:50] <mouseghost> last time i checked the free tier was pretty limited ;p
[01:57:04] <mouseghost> id get into botting tbh, but im a bit too dumb to RE it hahaha
[01:57:37] <Brekkjern> Don't have to use free tier characters for botting though

[01:59:32] <mouseghost> Brekkjern, how did u bot?
[02:00:03] <Brekkjern> It's so long since I did it that it's irrelevant now. I only had a mining character doing mining over night and while I was at school
[02:00:12] <companion_cube> bro do you even bot
[02:00:22] <Brekkjern> And I only did it for a few weeks
[02:00:26] <epilys> bro I bot in nullsec space

[02:10:37] <mouseghost> oh
[02:10:42] <mouseghost> whats the actual rate?
[02:10:55] <epilys> for my current clients around 100 euros
[02:11:39] <epilys> depends on how difficult the job is
[02:12:12] <mouseghost> epilys, wo that game u linked before is in haskell
[02:12:44] <epilys> it's not the only one of its kind out there I guess
[02:13:04] <mouseghost> i want 100eur toooooooo aaaa

[02:18:38] <manicennui> I'd be interested to know what his argument is against bumping the major version to remove significant features.
[02:19:07] <manicennui> I agree that it's interesting that the maintainers wanted to remove it, and that it should have never been added.
[02:19:54] <manicennui> I still don't understand why it does string interpolation on log messages.
[02:20:02] <manicennui> Sounds like the feature was mostly added for config.
[02:20:36] <manicennui> And if it were going to do it on log messages, it should be on the template for the message, not the message after the specifics have been interpolated.
[02:22:23] <imode> someone needs to make the joy of painting, but for programming.
[02:23:05] <manicennui> What aspect of Joy of Painting do you enjoy?
[02:23:34] <imode> composing the multiple layers, the blending, the improvised building up of a scene, and the ease of which it all happens.
[02:23:47] <manicennui> Hmm.
[02:23:55] <manicennui> So the material builds on itself?
[02:23:56] <imode> the commentary ties it together.
[02:24:00] <imode> yeah.
[02:24:08] <imode> very much so. small actions give you a lot of value.
[02:24:20] <imode> simple strokes build mountains and cloud and buildings and trees.
[02:24:42] <manicennui> Oh.
[02:24:43] <mouseghost> good night
[02:24:48] <imode> night mouseghost.
[02:24:49] <manicennui> That is the name of Bob Ross's show.

[02:25:07] <imode> yeah.
[02:25:16] <manicennui> So you want to sit and watch someone build something?
[02:25:22] <manicennui> And comment on the techniques?
[02:25:33] <Brekkjern> THat's juST coDiNG iN pyThon thouGH
[02:25:36] <manicennui> I've definitely seen individual videos like that.
[02:25:37] <imode> yeah. in a similar style. I did that at one point on twitch, but I had to quit due to mental health reasons.
[02:25:53] <imode> we built a small isometric voxel renderer in simple steps.
[02:25:58] <imode> as well as a simple raytracer in C.
[02:26:08] <manicennui> Yeah, the ones I've seen are graphics/games related.
[02:26:09] <imode> less than maybe 200 LoC overall per piece.
[02:26:36] <imode> along with a "hunt the wumpus" clone that I took suggestions on extending live.
[02:26:50] <imode> maybe I should return to streaming, I was at the front page at one point.
[02:27:10] <epilys> imode, that's what my book is about (simple raster graphics step by step concept by concept)
[02:27:25] <imode> yeh but it doesn't need to be _about_ graphics.
[02:27:31] <imode> it can be anything.
[02:27:38] <manicennui> Actually I just thought of a channel like this for games programming.
[02:27:42] <epilys> yeah I was referring to a specific instance of what you're saying
[02:27:50] <imode> aha. so you're writing a book?

[02:29:19] <imode> manicennui: that is a _neat channel_. marine biologist RPG is not something I would've thought of.
[02:29:21] <manicennui> He is nice and calm and the game is cute.
[02:29:43] <epilys> sounds awesome, wish I could concentrate on videos. I mainly read stuff
[02:30:01] <imode> I think showcasing a variety of small pieces IMO is better than larger pieces. ross does so much with so little effort.
[02:30:21] <imode> one of my favorite experiments was the voxel renderer and editor. it just functioned via SDL.
[02:30:37] <imode> we made the voxels in GIMP, it was all 2D, and by the end we were making farms with fences.
[02:30:51] <imode> same with hunt the wumpus, that turned into nearly a full text adventure.
[02:30:57] <imode> stuff that can fit into a half hour or an hour.
[02:31:13] <manicennui> My friend is building a game and does videos about some aspects of it, but they are all kinds of things and not often pure building.
[02:31:22] <epilys> yeah I was writing about drawing bezier curves and my code evolved into a small font glyph editor in an hour
[02:31:32] <imode> haha.

[02:33:23] <epilys> it was just a fun thing to do
[02:33:42] <epilys> it uses quadratic beziers; font designing apps use cubic or more complicated splines

[02:36:09] <epilys> the recording, not exactly

[05:19:14] <manicennui> Why is that absurd?
[05:32:42] <dimadima> huge and in mega prime location and i'm guessing tax empty and how many christian scientists live in chicago (or anywhere)?
[05:33:15] <dimadima> and, unrelated to the above question, it's just an absurd looking modern-brutalist building
[05:33:42] <demiurge> i like brutalist buildings

[05:35:19] <dimadima> i'm not sure how brutalist it is

[05:36:17] <manicennui> I honestly have never seen this thing.
[05:36:32] <dimadima> i've seen it a million times it's right there
[05:36:42] <manicennui> Not sure how.
[05:36:42] <demiurge> that's definitely nonzero brutalist
[05:36:46] <dimadima> where the street curves
[05:36:50] <manicennui> I've definitely been on that part of Wacker.
[05:37:14] <dimadima> it's more impressive in person to me for some reason
[05:37:35] <manicennui> I think I'm usually coming down Michigan or I'm hitting Wacker farther west.
[05:37:43] <demiurge> the embrasure-looking windows are a pretty brutalist meme i think
[05:37:56] <manicennui> Looks pretty large on the interior.
[05:38:05] <manicennui> Hard to tell the scale from exterior photos though.
[05:38:21] <dimadima> i'd wait for the bus across the street
[05:38:30] <dimadima> the 6 i think

[05:41:19] <dimadima> that building is a favorite of mine, though it sucks that it's a prison

[05:41:48] <dimadima> is what it is
[05:41:58] <demiurge> i'm never clear on why americans make a distinction between the two
[05:42:10] <manicennui> It's a federal prison.
[05:42:12] <demiurge> in en-gb they're two words for the same thing
[05:42:13] <dimadima> a jail is where you're held awaiting stuff
[05:42:22] <dimadima> or where you're put if you're drunk or something
[05:42:26] <dimadima> manicennui: really?
[05:42:28] <manicennui> Cook County Jail is elsewhere.
[05:42:30] <dimadima> people just ... do prison time there?
[05:42:30] <manicennui> dimadima: Yes.
[05:42:48] <manicennui> Yup.
[05:42:53] <dimadima> ) is a United States federal prison in Chicago, Illinois
[05:42:59] <dimadima> why would they do that in the loop lol
[05:43:15] <dimadima> there must be a federal court there or something

[05:46:59] <dimadima> right there in the beginning

[05:50:13] <manicennui> I actually work a couple blocks away, so I've seen the Federal Center countless times.
[05:50:30] <manicennui> Yeah, the post office is a cool building.
[05:51:04] <dimadima> yeah
[05:51:30] <dimadima> i worked a long time at lasalle/lake so i had a similar experience with the much less attractive city center
[05:51:35] <manicennui> Daley Center is also nice and has a Picasso sculpture.
[05:52:18] <dimadima> yeah daley center i think i meant
[05:52:28] <dimadima> no not that
[05:52:36] <dimadima> that one is cool
[05:52:50] <manicennui> You are talking about the Thompson Center.
[05:53:17] <manicennui> I can't stand the Thompson Center.
[05:53:18] <dimadima> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_R._Thompson_Center
[05:53:19] <buttsbot> James R. Thompson Center - Wikipedia
[05:53:20] <dimadima> yeah
[05:53:39] <dimadima> went to that food court a lot. that place is grimey
[05:53:42] <dimadima> building is whack
[05:53:43] <manicennui> There is always talk of tearing it down and some people defend it.
[05:53:48] <manicennui> But I think most people hate it.
[05:53:52] <dimadima> it's terrible
[05:53:55] <dimadima> who defends it
[05:54:04] <manicennui> Probably architecture buffs.
[05:54:19] <manicennui> Some people seem to think we should never tear down anything.
[05:54:27] <dimadima> what's wrong with it
[05:54:36] <dimadima> tear down everything
[05:54:40] <manicennui> I think it has low occupancy.
[05:54:46] <dimadima> is it publicly owned?
[05:54:51] <dimadima> or managed?
[05:55:13] <dimadima> it's the worst of the 80s
[05:55:25] <manicennui> "In 2019, Illinois governor J. B. Pritzker signed a bill to begin the sale of the Thompson Center, with a proposed three-year timeline to find a buyer. This has sparked activism from preservationists and architects concerned about the future of the building.[1]"
[05:55:32] <manicennui> Yeah, I didn't realize that it is.
[05:55:32] <dimadima> lol
[05:55:58] <dimadima> The Clark/Lake 'L' station, the second busiest in the system, is housed between the Thompson Center and the 203 N. LaSalle building across the stree
[05:55:59] <manicennui> "It houses offices of the Illinois state government and serves as a secondary capitol for the State of Illinois in the most populated city and county of the state."
[05:56:13] <dimadima> i worked at 203 lasalle so i went through thompson every day to get to the train
[05:56:14] <manicennui> First of all, the damn capitol should be Chicago.
[05:56:39] <companion_cube> where's the capitol?
[05:56:44] <dimadima> springfield
[05:56:45] <manicennui> companion_cube: Downstate
[05:56:54] <manicennui> A place where most people in the state will never visit
[05:56:55] <dimadima> like all states should be
[05:57:04] <manicennui> And our governor is often from Chicago
[05:57:11] <manicennui> And has to travel there
[05:57:33] <manicennui> No one wants to live down there
[05:57:41] <dimadima> it throws a gone bone to the downstate people otherwise chicago/illinois would collapse
[05:57:53] <manicennui> Why would it collapse?
[05:57:59] <manicennui> Most of the people and the GDP are up here.
[05:58:11] <dimadima> i mean someone would secede
[05:58:23] <manicennui> No one ever secedes.
[05:58:25] <dimadima> i'm exaggerating
[05:58:49] <manicennui> Our best engineering school is also downstate for some reason.
[05:59:23] <dimadima> why not?
[05:59:44] <manicennui> Why isn't it in Chicago?
[05:59:54] <dimadima> why isn't las vegas in chicago?
[05:59:57] <manicennui> Like why doesn't UIC have comparable programs?
[05:59:57] <companion_cube> gotta keep the nerds away from normal people
[06:00:19] <dimadima> cause engineering needs room and a rural setting to blow up shit
[06:00:26] <dimadima> and contemplate vastness
[06:00:35] <manicennui> For CS?
[06:00:56] <dimadima> UIC is just a not the best school
[06:00:59] <dimadima> and that's okay
[06:01:08] <dimadima> illinois can be better
[06:01:12] <dimadima> go orange1
[06:01:14] <dimadima> !
[06:01:14] <manicennui> Sure, but why isn't it as good or better than UIUC for CS and EE?
[06:01:33] <dimadima> i don't know
[06:01:36] <dimadima> more land
[06:01:39] <dimadima> bigger campus
[06:01:45] <dimadima> i wouldn't want to go to college in a city
[06:01:46] <manicennui> It's a really good state school, but somehow not considered as good for a bunch of programs.
[06:01:54] <manicennui> Really?
[06:02:04] <dimadima> most schools are fine
[06:02:13] <manicennui> College is probably the first time a lot of people have the opportunity to go to a city.
[06:02:14] <dimadima> yeah uchicago wasn't really in the city
[06:02:20] <dimadima> like UIC is way more downtown
[06:02:21] <manicennui> Instead they want to go to school in the middle of farmland?
[06:02:42] <dimadima> schools like that have college towns around, often large ones
[06:02:50] <manicennui> UIUC is also considered good for accounting.
[06:03:11] <manicennui> Sure, but I've heard you can smell the farms pretty often down there.
[06:03:22] <manicennui> I've worked with UIUC grads.
[06:03:26] <dimadima> good for the constitution
[06:03:45] <manicennui> NYC also doesn't seem to have the best schools.
[06:04:02] <manicennui> The best schools always seem to be off in some weird spot.
[06:04:07] <dimadima> it has columbia, nyu and fordham
[06:04:12] <dimadima> and the city colleges
[06:04:15] <manicennui> Best schools near Boston are outside the city.
[06:04:17] <dimadima> and what's its name
[06:04:22] <dimadima> cooper union
[06:04:32] <dimadima> and yeshiva
[06:04:35] <dimadima> that's not a bad crop
[06:04:37] <manicennui> Sure, NYC and Chicago have some great schools, and a few programs that are in the top 10.
[06:04:46] <dimadima> and rockefeller!
[06:04:49] <manicennui> But nothing like what you'd expect from Chicago and NYC.
[06:05:15] <dimadima> huh
[06:05:22] <dimadima> well it's like the sports teams
[06:05:29] <dimadima> new york sucks at sports
[06:05:33] <dimadima> relatively speaking
[06:05:39] <dimadima> columbia is like the yankees
[06:05:46] <manicennui> We both have two baseball teams.
[06:06:08] <manicennui> Does NYC have a hockey team?
[06:06:12] <dimadima> yeah
[06:06:13] <dimadima> the rangers
[06:06:22] <manicennui> That's right.
[06:06:27] <manicennui> Soccer?
[06:06:38] <dimadima> yeah
[06:06:45] <dimadima> i forget what they're called
[06:06:51] <dimadima> pretty sure anyway
[06:06:58] <manicennui> Apparently the are called the New York City Football Club.
[06:06:59] <manicennui> LAME
[06:07:06] <dimadima> FC NYC
[06:07:14] <dimadima> they're trying to be euro
[06:07:39] <manicennui> We have the FIRE
[06:07:53] <manicennui> Named after our greatest tragedy I assume.
[06:07:59] <dimadima> lol
[06:08:08] <dimadima> that's hilarious
[06:08:11] <dimadima> how has that never occurred to me
[06:08:16] <manicennui> "The franchise is named after the Great Chicago Fire of 1871"
[06:08:19] <dimadima> WTF
[06:08:22] <manicennui> Fuck yeah!
[06:08:25] <dimadima> AMAZING
[06:08:34] <manicennui> Does SF have a team named The Quake?
[06:08:46] <dimadima> in 2101 there will be some team called the Nine-Elevens
[06:09:08] <dimadima> they should have a team called that
[06:09:09] <manicennui> "Please welcome your Nagasaki Atomic Bombs!"
[06:09:21] <dimadima> they're big in japan
[06:10:09] <dimadima> the chicago motherfucking fire
[06:10:13] <dimadima> god bless americans
[06:10:24] <dimadima> turning lemons into lemonade since 1776
[06:10:56] <dimadima> america*
[06:11:29] <manicennui> Twin Towers might be a better name.
[06:12:00] <manicennui> If they were a soccer team, then obviously the Chicago Fire would beat them.
[06:12:02] <manicennui> Because, you iknow.

[20:45:23] <Xe> yes
[20:45:34] <gwozniak> then that would be the problem
[20:45:59] <gwozniak> Seems I missed the flurry of log4j posts
[20:48:23] <gwozniak> I was visiting some friends in Toronto yesterday (pro tip: never drive there) and one of the people I visited works at a hospital in the legal department.  Nothing to do with IT at all, but they showed me a message they got about the log4j thing and asked, "Is this legit?
[20:49:15] <indigo> Hah
[20:49:25] <gwozniak> Is the consensus that there is no consensus as to how such a thing managed to happen?

[20:53:29] <indigo> Ahh
[20:53:44] <Xe> gwozniak: it is not, but my goal with that article was to troll people into thinking up a better solution by proposing an obviously unworkable one
[20:54:24] <gwozniak> I have not seen or read any articles on it at this point.  I've only seen some comments on Twitter and Masto and such
[20:56:51] <indigo> Sadly it seems like most of the comments are like the dog in the burning room

[22:22:45] <epilys> Think before you FLOSS!
[22:26:01] <demiurge> i don't think story merging was abused and on balance i'm glad it happened because otherwise lobsters would just be the log4j2 discussion forum for the next fortnight
[22:26:39] <Brekkjern> If we had a way to downvote shit then it wouldn't be so much of a problem IMO
[22:26:49] <Brekkjern> Lame takes would disappear rather rapidly
[22:26:52] <demiurge> yes it would because people won't downvote that stuff
[22:27:15] <demiurge> and a take not being lame doesn't mean it's good for the site to be filled with nothing else
[22:27:25] <Brekkjern> I mean... There would be a story about it on the front page for a while, I agree, but it wouln't be filled with it at all times
[22:27:40] <demiurge> there would be lots of stories about it on the front page for a while
[22:27:40] <Brekkjern> It's not like it is filled with anything else really
[22:27:55] <demiurge> it's supposed not to be filled with anything else...
[22:29:38] <demiurge> merging means that there's room for other things on the front page. if it didn't happen the front page would be like 30% log4j now, and i don't think that would be great either
[22:33:12] <demiurge> i'm sufficiently pessimistic that i don't really expect any good discussions to come out of the "this ecosystem is fucked up" posts, although it is
[22:37:24] <gwozniak> Downvotes are nice in some cases, but so often abused that I am glad lobste.rs doesn't use them
[22:37:32] <river> yeah
[22:37:44] <river> i feel like downvotes creates a monocultue
[22:37:45] <gwozniak> I hide things more often now
[22:37:47] <river> culture*
[22:39:04] <demiurge> people do still downvote things on lobsters because they disagree with them, despite all the design effort that's gone into trying to avoid that
[22:39:37] <river> yeah
[22:40:33] <Brekkjern> And if you don't have it, then the only sort of posts you will see at the top is whatever appeals to the largest group of the site
[22:40:43] <demiurge> that is also what you'll see if you do have it
[22:40:52] <Brekkjern> Either way sucks, but one of them requires more active moderation
[22:41:03] <demiurge> i don't think this way sucks as much
[22:43:30] <demiurge> i think what you're suggesting would only amplify the problem that you're describing. it's caused by people upvoting what they like (or more find engaging i guess). if they can downvote what they don't want to upvote, that'll just tip the scales even further towards submissions that everyone likes
[22:44:02] <river> I thin kthat what the most people vote for, being at the top is correct
[22:44:11] <river> and it goes hand in hand with stuff that's not appropriate being removed
[22:44:16] <demiurge> it's just that people are often wrong
[22:44:24] <demiurge> but there's no way to avoid that
[22:44:55] <demiurge> anyway the problem Brekkjern is trying to solve with downvotes seems quite unrelated to the problem merging solves, which is that there are loads of individually good submissions about the same thing
[22:45:29] <Brekkjern> No, they are related. If you don't merge you will have a bunch of threads. Some of them will suck. Others will be good.
[22:45:44] <Brekkjern> Problem being, there is no way to push shit off the front page. Only bump it up.
[22:45:50] <demiurge> yes there is
[22:46:02] <Brekkjern> Well, yes. Having a moderator merge the thread.
[22:46:07] <Brekkjern> But then we're back to square 1.
[22:46:30] <demiurge> i mean, if you want to go in circles...
[23:04:22] <dimadima> "< indigo> > Publishing an open-source project is like having a child" yikes
[23:04:44] <dimadima> "< epilys> Think before you FLOSS!" <3
[23:07:54] <dimadima> having a child isn't like that either, for that matter
[23:08:00] <dimadima> sometimes you just have a child
[23:09:24] <dimadima> like, you may have a spite child, or a drunk child
[23:10:16] <dimadima> or a just-for-fun child
