[23:25:18] <The_8472> To a netsplit?
[23:25:40] <The_8472> ah no, he was back after that
[23:36:32] <TheSHADOW> https://files.catbox.moe/0t7g6z.jpg - if this is correct, not only is omicron at best flulike but so was delta.
[23:38:48] <The_8472> you have to factor in vaccinations
[23:39:06] <The_8472> and for omicron there'll be a few weeks of delay for the deaths
[23:39:41] <The_8472> and by the time we learn that and with its current doubling rate we'll get the information too late to act in any useful manner on it
[23:39:52] <The_8472> except ordering or canceling coffins.
