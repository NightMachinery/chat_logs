[00:01:04] <somiaj> Cera: x+y = 1*x + 1*y + 0*z, and 1 and 0 are in the ring right?
[00:02:19] <Cera> constant polynomials are always in the ring so yes
[00:02:32] <somiaj> well here I'm talking about 0 and 1 being in k.
[00:03:21] <somiaj> I'm just pointing out that what it means to have all three variables can depend, in this case you could have a z there even if it isn't written down explicity
[00:03:32] <Cera> yeah, they're in k (here k has to be an infinite field).
[00:03:33] <Cera> gotcha gotcha

[00:04:59] <somiaj> And the definition of k[x,y,z] is { finite sum k_i x^a_i y^b_i z^c_i : k_i in k, and a_i,b_i,c_i in N }
[00:05:40] <Z-module> yes as long as 0 is in N

[00:05:49] <somiaj> So you could also just view x+y as 1*x^1*y^0*z^0 + 1*x^0*y^1*z^0 using that definition, showing that x+y is in the ring.
[00:06:34] <somiaj> Z-module: be nice if we could say N without having to add that condition. Hence why I prefer N vs Z^+
[00:07:26] <Z-module> x + y means 1x + 1y + 0z   and this is in k[x,y,z] for ANY field k whatsoever, including finite k. 0 and 1 are in every field.

[02:48:53] <adder> yeah somiaj
[02:49:01] <adder> no wait
[02:49:01] <somiaj> I think this is your issue, you should compare to zero

[02:49:38] <somiaj> and you will need to consider the sign of the numerator and denominator to figure out when that fraction is positive

[02:51:36] <somiaj> well that is the first thing I think I see

[07:23:04] <greenbagels> my first thought was that you were talking hex for a second int-e
[07:23:08] <int-e> It's really hard to imagine modern mathematics without zero.
[07:24:49] <firestarter> why is anything^0 = 1?
[07:25:44] <int-e> because you want a^0 = a^(b-b) = a^b/a^b

[07:26:31] <greenbagels> alternatively you define it for positive integers, negative integers, then rationals, then demand continuity or something
[07:26:40] <int-e> And you can have that nice property by picking a^0 = 1. 0^0, well it turns out that 0^0 = 1 is a) what you get combinatorially. and b) often useful in other contexts as well.

[07:28:30] <alphamule2> Powers of 0 is actually kind of awfulo.
[07:28:32] <firestarter> that first answer of yours is really revealing. awesome.
[07:28:35] <alphamule2> As a concept
[07:28:42] <dude12312414> it's kind of annoying that in almost all cases where 0^0 "could" be defined as something, that something is 1
[07:29:13] <dude12312414> what i mean is, i can't think of "natural" scenarios where defining 0^0 = 2 would be useful, for example
[07:29:14] <alphamule2> IT's like the trivial cases for x^n + y^n = z^n
[07:29:41] <alphamule2> If ANY of them (x,y,z) are 0, then it's trivally easy to find as many answers as you want.
[07:30:06] <alphamule2> If you want a limit, then 0^0 is 0
[07:30:10] <int-e> dude12312414: right. there must be some approach (x,y) -> (0,0) for which x^y has that limit... but who even cares what that approach is? :)
[07:30:23] <firestarter> i'd also would like to understand how the sum of all (natural?) numbers can be -12 ... but i doubt that's simple.
[07:30:31] <firestarter> i mean i know it isn't
[07:30:38] <firestarter> was it natural numbers?
[07:30:55] <alphamule2> It's -1/12th right?  For some series?
[07:31:04] <int-e> firestarter: it's zeta(-1) = -1/12 and it's a terrible abuse of notation

[07:31:56] <dude12312414> no the zeta(-1) result is proven
[07:34:16] <int-e> You have zeta(z) = sum[n=1 to oo] 1/n^z  for z with Re(z) > 1. And then you throw complex analysis at that beast to get a "holomorphic function" on C - {1}, and that evaluates to -1/12 at -1. Note that Re(-1) > 1 is false.

[09:41:21] <isekaijin> pounce: And, yes, holomorphic sections of a holomorphic vector bundle are just as rigid as holomorphic functions on a complex manifold.
[09:41:36] <pounce> ah nice
[09:42:55] <isekaijin> If you have a holomorphic vector bundle on a compact complex manifold, often the vector space of global sections is finite-dimensional.
[09:43:03] <pounce> oh right, i know that
[09:43:59] <pounce> also I don't think "often" i think it always is
[09:44:26] <isekaijin> Maybe< I just wanted to play safe.

[14:07:02] <PlanckWalk> Z_2[x]/(x^2+x+1) = {q + (x^2 + x + 1) | q in Z_2[x]}, and there's always soem q of degree < 2.
[14:07:29] <PlanckWalk> So you can choose q to be of the form  a + bx

[16:49:59] <sek> anyway, you can also give examples of degree 0 non-principal divisors: eg it's an exercise in riemann-roch to show that if p\neq q are two points on C, then p-q is principal iff C=P1
[16:50:20] <tempate> my background is on projective algebraic curves, so that is fine to prove

[18:25:43] <ProfSimm> In functional programming it doesn't matter when you reduce, because without mutable variables and side-effects you can choose to reduce whenever

[20:48:16] <Pollion> If it is Z_2, then you can prove that it is a field, and x^2+x+1 is irreducible.
[20:48:27] <Pollion> If it is Z/2Z*
[20:49:43] <Pollion> Therefore, your ring is in fact a field, it is an extension of degree 2 of the finite field F_2 with 2 elements: It is the (only) field with 2^2 = 4 elements (also denoted by F_4).
[20:50:00] <cadmio> assuming it's a field what are the elements?

[20:52:38] <Pollion> Different way of seeing that. If you are convinced that this ring has 4 elements, then it is really easy.
[20:52:50] <Pollion> As I mentioned, it contains F_2, so you have at least 0, 1.
[20:53:51] <Pollion> You need to find an element that is not in F_2. By definition, your ring contains a root of x^2+x+1. This is precisely x (mod x^2+x+1).
[20:53:59] <cadmio> Z_2[x] is the ring you can have x^2 also, isn't it? (reducing to 2nd degree polys)

[20:54:54] <Z-module> cadmio, let I mean the ideal (x^2 + x + 1) in Z_2[x]. Technically the four elements of the quotient ring Z_2[x]/I  are the cosets  0 + I, 1 + I, x + I,  x + 1 + I.   You can caculate  (x + I)(x + 1 + I) = x^2 + x + I, but this = 1 + I  because  x^2 + x - 1 = x^2 + x + 1  is in I. (- is the same as + in this ring, since it has characteristic 2).

[21:15:52] <Z-module> cadmio: any time you have a commutative ring A and some single element b of A, the notations  (b) , <b> , Ab   all mean the ideal generated by b, and is simply the set { ab : all a in A }
[21:16:06] <Z-module> Here, the ring A is Z_2[x] and b is the one polynomial x^2 + x + 1
[21:17:03] <Z-module> (note: this assumes the ring A has 1, but I'm pretty sure you're never going to deal with rings lacking 1 in this course -- they're a strange nonstandard topic)

[21:18:54] <Z-module> cadmio: anyway, if I is any ideal of the ring A, then the quotient ring A/I really means the quotient *group* A/I  (using the + operation of A), meaning the additive group of all possible cosets  a + I , in which element multiplication is defined as  (a + I)(a' + I) = aa' + I   to make this quotient into a ring.

[21:19:55] <cadmio> right

[21:33:47] <Z-module> it's *really* that the elements are all of the form   a + bt + I    where I = <t^2 + t + 1> in Z_2[t], and in the ring  Z_2[t]/I, the element x = t + I  satisfies  x^2 + x + 1 = 0.
[21:34:11] <Z-module> But they drop off the  + I   from each element and just have a formal system of four elements, with a weird type of multliplication.
[21:34:54] <cadmio> so it's useless to change the variable from x to t
[21:36:58] <cadmio> so this is because the product p(x)(x^2+x+1) cannot have degree < 2?
[21:37:16] <bosspotato> Z-module: I'm confused by the exercise you posted, if A and B are n x n complex matrices both with rank < n/2, don't we immediately get that their kernels have nontrivial intersection so that A + wB doesn't have full rank for any w?
[21:38:05] <Z-module> bosspotato: sure, it's easy, but to me they really should have ruled out the most trivial solution by requring w != 0.
[21:38:38] <bosspotato> I mean, it would've made way more sense to just say "for any w" by that point
[21:39:07] <Z-module> oh wait, it's true for *all* complex w ?

[22:32:23] <Z-module> Cera, if A is any commutative ring whatsoever, A[x] is the ring of all polynomials over the indeterminate x with coefficients in A.  For this, A does not need to be a field.
[22:33:20] <Galois> to do it more rigorously, start with polynomials in one variable. Let R be a ring. A power series in one variable with coefficients in R is a function from N to R. Equivalently, it's an element of R^N. Note here N is the set of all natural numbers, not a particular natural number.
[22:33:38] <Galois> a polynomial in one variable is a power series in one variable with finite support (that is, all but finitely many values are zero).
[22:34:18] <Galois> Denote the set of polynomials in one variable by R[x]. Then prove that R[x] is a ring. This is surprisingly tricky if you do it rigorously.
[22:34:47] <Galois> Once you have that R[x] is a ring, you can define polynomials (again in one variable) over R[x]. So, for example, (R[x])[y]
[22:35:01] <Galois> and that's how you get polynomials in two variables. Repeat for any desired (finite) number of variables.
