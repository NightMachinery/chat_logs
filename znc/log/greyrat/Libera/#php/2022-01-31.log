[06:37:23] <relipse> anyone good at math and relative positioning
[06:38:03] <relipse> I want to drag an image around a div, but i could only get it to work with position: absolute, but I need it to be relative so that when I save the coordinates it will be relative to the div, does that make sense?

[06:41:27] <Albright> Not a PHP question, but the div should have position: relative and the image should have position: absolute
[06:41:44] <Albright> In that case the positioning of the image with left/top/right/bottom will be relative to the div.
[06:43:01] <Albright> That is, if the image has `left: 10px;`, the left edge of it will be 10px to the right of the left edge of the div.
[06:43:51] <relipse> oh really
[06:44:00] <relipse> so containing div has position: relative
[06:44:15] <relipse> and everything inside has position: absolute
[06:44:40] <relipse> thanks i'll give that a shot
[06:44:48] <Albright> Assuming I'm understanding what you're looking for correctly, yes.
[06:45:10] <Albright> i guess it does seem kind of backwards now that I think of it.
[06:46:24] <relipse> i seemed to fo always thought that position: absolute meant x,y on the entier page
[06:46:26] <relipse> entire~
[06:46:59] <Blondie101010> nope, #css
[06:59:55] <relipse> ok so check it out: https://cworklog.com/eingame2/level_editor_dom.php
[07:00:24] <relipse> now how do I get the 75px inset border to go all the way around the div (see it is white in bottom and right)

[13:44:48] <rb> is there a way to set a timeout for a specific query (not all of them)?
[13:45:46] <rb> this is mysqli
[13:49:28] <Naktibalda> set timeout before query, reset afterwards.
[13:52:07] <rb> would that be done with a DB query?
[13:52:17] <rb> or is there a setting in mysqli for this?
[13:52:28] <Naktibalda> I thought that you know how to set timeout fot all queries :)
[13:53:09] <rb> nope don't know that either :^)
[13:56:09] <rb> apparently mariadb allows me to set per-statement timeouts so i guess i'll be using that, cheers

[17:43:06] <chrg> hello. i'm trying to test a web app that uses php, apache2 and mysql. running my php scripts from the terminal works, however running from localhost doesn't work.
[17:43:36] <chrg> looking at the error logs, it seems php can't find mysqli, even though i've installed it (i'm using debian and i installed it with 'apt install php-mysqli')
[17:44:58] <chrg> this is the error, by the way: https://pastebin.com/8vHnyHze
[17:45:46] <AllenJB> chrg: You may need to enable the extension (for the correct Server API - mod_php or php-fpm depending on how you're running PHP). Read up on 'phpenmod', which I believe debian may use
[17:46:13] <AllenJB> Also make sure you've restarted Apache / php-fpm since installing/enabling extensions or updating php.ini
[17:46:47] <__adrian> ^ or you may need to install it. note most distros do NOT use the same packages for php cli vs. apache/whatever.
[17:47:34] <__adrian> that is, "works on cli" usually has nothing to do with what will work on your webserver.

[19:13:09] <varrg> why are static properties not allowed to be readonly? I need a readonly property holding the result of a function call.
[19:13:42] <varrg> at the moment using instance property, but it would be better suited as a constant or static property
[19:15:28] <__adrian> readonly is coming, BUT (imo) it's an incomplete/bad solution.
[19:15:40] <varrg> I think I'll go with a private static property then
[19:15:57] <varrg> yeah, I would like to be able to instantiate it from outside the class
[19:16:07] <__adrian> readonly ≠ const. if you don't want some value to be changed, then the simplest solution is to not change it
[19:17:33] <varrg> yeah, but f.ex, my current problem is having a charlist, but it's too long to be spelled out, so I'm constructing it in a init() method using implode on range(). It would make sense for the resulting string to be publicly visible, but it shouldn't change
[19:17:51] <__adrian> (a) don
[19:17:57] <__adrian> (a) don't write code that changes it
[19:18:07] <__adrian> (b) make it nonpublic and use a getter method
[19:19:00] <varrg> yeah, the b) approach is fine but it makes a cluttered __get if there are several - perhaps with various logic
[19:20:16] <__adrian> again, "getter" ≠ __get()
[19:20:35] <__adrian> i don't advocate for the use of __get(). you _can_, if you want to, of course.
[19:20:48] <varrg> ah, yeah. Not important enough to dedicate a method to it, imo.
[19:21:04] <__adrian> IF you use __get(), it should *definitely not* be a switch($name) statement.
[19:21:18] <__adrian> it should delegate to dedicated method(s).
[19:21:36] <varrg> I'm actually using a __get and __set to enforce immutability of properties that internally must change. The code is clear but I don't like it. I would rather have javascript's getter/setter syntax
[19:22:25] <__adrian> js accessors are a decent model. there have been RFC's to add similar things to php. i was very disappointed that `readonly` was added instead.

[19:23:35] <varrg> yeah, to evaluate a value is very handy
[19:23:57] <varrg> lots is happening with php though, so the future is bright
[19:25:39] <varrg> using enums recently, overall very good. But I would like to group them. You can set a constant in the same class, but then they can't be differentiated which is a shame. Now that I think about it, maybe you could make multiple enums and have them inherit eachother to achieve that

[19:48:00] <judah> Flip the keys and values, call array_values to reset the new keys, then the string you want will be at offset 0
[19:48:10] <judah> If I understood what is going on
[19:48:18] <__adrian> that's not var_export; might be var_dump (but looks modified)
[19:48:22] <Naktibalda> robertparkerx: view source
[19:48:40] <__adrian> judah: if that's the case, they can just use the $key instead of the $value
[19:50:08] <judah> This is true, if its in a loop where that is accessible. Would be easier to say if we could see the source
[19:51:31] <__adrian> indeed; but if it wasn't in a loop then there would be no need to look up at all (i.e., if they're accessing the array directly, they already know the desired $key (and therefore the url))
[19:52:15] <Naktibalda> so the structure is  url => image-tag
[19:52:58] <Naktibalda> robertparkerx: foreach ($array as $url => $imageTag) { echo $imageTag;  }

[21:31:04] <FightingFalcon> good idea
[21:31:32] <F8ER> Hey all ^^
[21:31:58] <F8ER> Is it correct that throw doesn't change HTTP status code if already set?
[21:32:32] <F8ER> I mean, there's http_response_code(404) before throw \Exception, and it leaves it 404 no matter what which is ok, but just curious.
[21:32:48] <Naktibalda> try it and see
[21:32:50] <F8ER> Without setting the code manually, it's 500 by default (with thrown exception).
[21:33:02] <F8ER> Naktibalda, already tried and saw.
[21:33:19] <F8ER> have*
[21:33:36] <Naktibalda> in the old days of mod_php you would get status 200 on exception
[21:34:23] <F8ER> How does throw change it then? Does it change it to 500 only when the current is 200?
[21:34:36] *** Joins: ProfSimm (~ProfSimm@176-12-60-137.pon.spectrumnet.bg)
[21:35:34] <F8ER> I'll try checking sources
[21:38:19] <__adrian> F8ER: throwing does not change the http response status. however, _not catching_ a thrown exception will cause the response status to be 500.
[21:38:31] <FightingFalcon> da_wunder, unfortunately wp cli cannot get data from db
[21:38:49] <__adrian> specifically, "set 404, then throw" doesn't sounds sensible.
[21:39:20] <__adrian> "throw "not found" exception, catch and set 404" sounds more workable.

[21:41:03] <FightingFalcon> its already installed
[21:41:51] <da_wunder> also, if you look https://docs.wpvip.com/how-tos/write-custom-wp-cli-commands/ there is no note that you _cannot_ use database with those commands
