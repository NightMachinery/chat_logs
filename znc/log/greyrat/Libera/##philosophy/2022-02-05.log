[00:02:51] <ProfSimm> What if when you die, you actually don't die, but the world you were in dies.
[00:02:53] <Delf> Not at all! I have very strong relationship with this body

[00:03:39] <arryana> i think the only one who really wanted to die was the fellow who went backward
[00:03:51] <Delf> Depending on how I die, I may revive this body or I will take over other bodies and commit suicide a few million times
[00:04:27] <iryith> ProfSimm, The Bridge
[00:04:27] <ProfSimm> iryith: maybe they regret it didn't work
[00:04:44] <iryith> ProfSimm, no, they were pretty explicit that they regretted the action half way through
[00:04:57] <iryith> surprising the amount of introspection that can happen in 5 seconds
[00:05:19] <ProfSimm> iryith: by definitions all our decisions are impulse decisions, so I suppose once the impulse fires, we can have back and forth thoughts about it
[00:05:43] <iryith> you've apparently never been depressed to the point of suicide
[00:05:46] <iryith> it's not an impulse decision
[00:06:50] <Delf> That's an inaccurate assumption, iryith. One can be depressed BEYOND the point of suicide also. Considering suicide requires belief in death
[00:07:00] <ProfSimm> iryith: there can be persistent thoughts about it, but the decision itself is literally an impulse in your brain. Neurons reach a threshold, and an impulse fires. After which you're suddenly no longer motivated to do what you just did.

[00:32:51] <Delf> I've not had experience of them actually.. but that is not to say that I've not experienced irritating people
[00:32:51] <ProfSimm> Delf: I think we have behaviors we don't necessarily understand, but which accomodate some of our instincts and innate needs.
[00:33:08] <Delf> What needs?
[00:33:41] <ProfSimm> Delf: to get attention, to communicate, in some cases even more material needs.
[00:34:25] <ProfSimm> Delf: we're like a set of loops interacting with one another and each needs to be fed. On a physical level you can think of digestion cycle, breathing cycle, circulatory cycle, and so on

[00:44:26] <Delf> I've slightly seen an episode but don't remember much. It is best to be on the conscious side of cycling through those behaviors instead of leaving to emotions doing it for you
[00:45:44] <ProfSimm> Delf: I didn't mean everyone cycles through these, I think you misunderstood my point about interacting cycles.
[00:45:57] <ProfSimm> Delf: you know how your blood runs in a cycle, yes
[00:46:02] <ProfSimm> You also breathe in and out, in a cycle
[00:46:14] <ProfSimm> Eat and excrete, it's a cycle
[00:46:44] <ProfSimm> Well hopefully you don't eat what you excrete, but eventually it's a cycle, like Mufasa explained :P
[00:47:40] <Delf> These are behaviors that is not related to social situations
[00:47:54] <Delf> Unless you like to take a shit next to someone else, every time
[00:48:26] <Delf> Do you feel superior when you're having a shit?
[00:49:14] <ProfSimm> This was an example of how systems are made up of connected loops
[00:49:20] <ProfSimm> All systems, not just biological.
[00:49:42] <ProfSimm> And so all our mental needs and behaviors are also a similar network of connected loops.
[00:49:52] <ProfSimm> And we seek to satisfy them, often subconsciously.
[00:50:37] <ProfSimm> Intent is one of those things you can only guess about, but never prove. Did someone intend to do what they did. Or not
[00:50:48] <Delf> This analogy cannot be transferred successfully over to our emotional behavior. There are many who have no need to satisfy for example... fear or disgust or hatred and so n

[00:59:04] <causative> maybe you wouldn't get out of bed if you had no need to satisfy your internal state, but that's not what depression is
[00:59:24] <ProfSimm> You often see adolescents do this "I meant it" type of switch to protect their ego. But it also has evolutionary benefit.
[00:59:39] <ProfSimm> You switch a failure into a success, you're learning what you're good at, and you do more of it.
[00:59:45] <causative> depression is not an absence of caring, it's caring too much about things that you can't seem to control and feel bad about
[01:00:30] <causative> if you cared not at all, then getting out of bed would be just as easy as not getting out of bed; you'd be indifferent, not sad, and there would be no obstacle in your way to doing what you want.
[01:00:41] *** Quits: rez (~rez@user/rez) (Quit: much snoozes...)
[01:00:48] <ProfSimm> causative: I'd say you're right and I'm right, because our terms are often overloaded. There are different causes and types of depression
[01:01:32] <ProfSimm> causative: I don't know about not caring making all things just as easy, because not caring has a default, and that's doing nothing
[01:01:38] <causative> indifference is disjoint from suffering
[01:01:43] <causative> if you are indifferent you are not suffering
[01:01:47] <causative> if you are suffering you are not indifferent
[01:02:04] <ProfSimm> causative: we have an energy minimization behavior. Doing anything at all takes effort. So you're compelled to act.
[01:02:55] <ProfSimm> Disassociation can be mixed with depression, in which you no longer experience yourself as yourself.
[01:02:56] <causative> not caring doesn't have a default - if inaction seems like a default, it's because you aren't really talking about total indifference
[01:03:10] <causative> inaction is a default when all actions seem to have downsides that you can't handle
[01:03:13] <causative> that's not indifference
[01:03:45] <causative> if, as you say, we have "energy minimization" behavior, then indifference would be a completely flat plain with no maximums or minimums
[01:03:58] <causative> a "default" has to be a valley in the plain
[01:04:06] <causative> a valley in the plain is the opposite of indifference
[01:06:17] <ProfSimm> causative: how do you explain descriptions of depression as "not feeling anything"
[01:06:29] <causative> they're talking about not feeling *positive* things
[01:06:40] <causative> they do still feel, and care deeply about, negative things
[01:07:00] <ProfSimm> Well, I can definitely call that out now and say you're not correct.
[01:07:08] <causative> they don't see the upside of getting out of bed, but the downside is clear, so they stay in bed
[01:07:42] <causative> feeling awful because they understand the downside of staying in bed as well
[01:07:44] <ProfSimm> Depression can have powerful negative feelings, but it can also be being "numb to everything" as some describe it. Feeling nothing. Either bad or good.
[01:08:28] <ProfSimm> This is not something part of the colloquial description of depression. But it's part of the clinical description of depression

[01:11:20] <causative> to the extent such claims are true they are true only in a relative way - feeling less emotion than they had at other times
[01:12:01] <causative> if depression is stopping you from doing something you want to do, then this cannot be because of a lack of feeling.  What's stopping you?  Just do it!  If you can't muster the will to just do it, then there must be some emotion that overpowers you so you don't do it.
[01:12:28] <causative> and it may be that you feel less joy from doing it, and that lack of positivity makes it harder to resist the negativity
[01:12:39] <causative> but without any negativity at all there would be nothing in your way from doing it
[01:12:48] <ProfSimm> Well I already explained to you that effort requires motivation, but you seem to think feeling nothing means you can apparently do anything someone suggests
[01:13:02] <ProfSimm> Effect requires cause.
[01:13:10] <ProfSimm> No emotion means there's nothing to cause the effect
[01:13:29] <causative> imagine an air hockey puck skating along the table - that's indifference, a completely flat energy function
[01:13:39] <ProfSimm> A ball doesn't feel bad about moving, but it doesn't move regardless.
[01:13:41] <causative> the air hockey puck doesn't care where it is, which means it can go anywhere
[01:13:43] <ProfSimm> Unless pushed
[01:14:17] <ProfSimm> causative: the puck isn't moving relative to its PoV. The world is sliding by it
[01:14:23] <moonroost> it's a bit of a silly argument to have in the first place, but causative is mostly right. first, numbness and feeling down are not mutually exclusive. you can feel numb some of the time and down other times.
[01:14:24] <ProfSimm> So that wasn't an example of an action
[01:15:00] <moonroost> but numbness is a lot harder to notice... when watching how other people react to stimuli, you may realize that you lack such a reaction. it is hard to notice on your own because it becomes normalized over time. even moreso because depressed people often isolate
[01:15:33] *** Quits: mikey (~mikey@user/mikey) (Quit: leaving)
[01:15:56] <causative> ProfSimm, the metaphor of an energy function is a very good one, and if a ball is rolling around an energy landscape and happens to keep returning to the same "comfortable" locations, then we would conclude that those locations are low points in the energy landscape
[01:16:21] <causative> if the ball can move around without returning to any particular location, then and only then is the energy landscape flat
[01:16:50] <moonroost> the numbness is more of a downstream consequence of constant psychological rumination on negativity than anything else. it's not called a "mood disorder" for nothing
[01:16:54] <causative> in a completely flat landscape, even the slightest push could make the ball go anywhere
[01:17:20] <ProfSimm> causative: your metaphor is a good one only if we imagine the ball and the landscape as part of the internal state of the brain. As otherwise the ball is not doing anything. It's merely repositioned relative to the landscape by forces completely external to it
[01:18:36] <ProfSimm> causative: in that sense a body at rest, silence, lack of thought and emotion is like a ball at rest. And you can imagine it as a valley, or as a flat landscape, but in both cases the ball won't move
[01:19:39] <ProfSimm> moonroost: having no mood is a good enough reason to call it mood disorder.
[01:21:16] <moonroost> anhedonia is the major symptom. "inability to feel pleasure" != "numb," but you can see the connotations of "numb" are indeed related

[05:08:36] <inhahe_> https://philosophy.inhahe.com/2017/02/04/on-the-subject-of-aliens-and-their-crafts/
[05:08:37] <ro-bot-o> [url] On the Subject of "UFOs" ⋆ Philosophical and Other Essays | philosophy.inhahe.com
[05:20:27] <ProfSimm> inhahe_: I think the fact they're not attacking us en masse doesn't imply they're peacefully observing. It just implies we don't know what they want. If they want anything.
[05:20:47] <ProfSimm> inhahe_: twhy they'd be observing us is just as puzzling.
[05:23:11] <inhahe_> I think most alien species, at least those advanced enouh to be capable of reaching us, aren't violent and warlike like we are. That's just an aspect of being a primitive species, like we are, that we project on aliens as we imagine them. And I think they probably observe us for the same reason we observe nature on our planet.. they're studious. Or maybe because they see all species as
[05:23:11] <inhahe_> brothers and care deeply about our conditions and future.

[23:01:35] <iryith> love is a warm shower on a cold day
[23:15:54] <causative> love is when it makes you feel good when another person flourishes, and makes you feel bad if they are harmed
[23:17:13] <Delf> What the fuck
[23:17:45] <Delf> Why would you outsource love to what emotions you feel?
[23:17:48] <mycroftiv> love is a penny smell and doored thing
[23:18:11] <mycroftiv> and Splenda is a many lovered cream Thing
[23:19:27] <Delf> Sounds like obsession rather
[23:20:16] <mycroftiv> well, better to have an enjoyable obssession than bored days that seem too long yet you are gifted too few
[23:20:36] <Delf> Or too many
[23:21:02] * Delf is starting to get too old for life
[23:21:16] <mycroftiv> trying to love the universe and yourself as part of it and having that be fun is the best hobby ive found so far, but i think i should roll for a few rather than typing right now.
[23:21:28] <mycroftiv> yoyo my home keys
[23:22:45] <Delf> causative: Does that mean that I cannot love another person if I feel nothing?
[23:26:35] <mycroftiv> love and the pull of gravity are similar, just felt in a different way, i think
[23:26:54] <iryith> one is chemical and one is physical
[23:27:42] <mycroftiv> chemicals are physical, and i said physical, not identical
[23:27:49] <mycroftiv> err. i mean i said similar
[23:32:19] <Delf> Why have you mystified love so much? Afraid of breaking it?
[23:33:28] <Delf> Maybe you never actually understood it
[23:33:46] <iryith> can you actually 'understand' love?
[23:33:57] <Delf> Fucking right I can. I defined it!
[23:34:45] <Delf> All other forms of love are different variations of perversions
[23:34:56] <Delf> None of those qualify
[23:34:57] <iryith> what
[23:46:34] *** Joins: dude12312414 (~test@gateway/tor-sasl/dude12312414)
[23:49:48] <mycroftiv> love and anti-love indeed differ, but the infinite definitions of love and the infinite experiences of it can all coexist in us i believe
