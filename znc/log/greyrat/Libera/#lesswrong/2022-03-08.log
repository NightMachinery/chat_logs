[01:36:25] <two2thehead> 'This is one of the big dilemmas for gardeners to consider when adding new plants to the landscape. Typical commercial soil mixes are largely composed of peat and other organics. Such mixes hold water well and help prevent the plant from drying out too quickly and requiring more frequent watering. In the nursery where they are grown, this works out well. When these plants are transferred into the ground, however, problems can ensue if the root ball 
[01:36:25] <two2thehead> is allowed to dry out or the region surrounding the root ball is not kept sufficiently moist. Container-grown plants develop a well-defined root ball inside their pot. For those roots to leave that media, the soil around them has to entice them out of it. If it is too dry, they will not venture into it. If the root ball itself is allowed to dry out around the edges, the new root growth at the edges of the root ball will die and there will be no live 
[01:36:26] <two2thehead> roots there to venture out with. New roots will not grow downward into their new planting site if the soil below the root ball is dry either. Organics provide benefits to the nurseryperson, but they can complicate life for the gardener.'

[11:39:23] <feep[work]> someone, probably not me, should write a story like tnc, where the joke is that ... like, we spend one act setting up all the characters and their really basic motivations and goals and character beats, in like a 4x4 matrix or some such, and then there's a moment at the end of reality, where the viewpoint character talks about bitflips and the idea that for no reason, suddenly everything could go 
[11:39:29] <feep[work]> out of alignment 
[11:39:52] <feep[work]> and then for the next act and a half, everything is fucked up, characters are jumbled, goals are mixed together, until for no reason and with no explanation it all goes back to normal and the story ends
[11:40:54] <feep[work]> and - at the risk of spoiling - the joke is that on that matrix of characters to motivations to goals, we take a random number generator and reseed it to a state that will converge to 0 after ~10 iterations
[11:41:19] <feep[work]> and we keep adding it to every character's structure, with one update per chapter

[11:45:18] <feep[work]> like, if your narrative can continue in the face of an attack on the human narrative memeplex, you have not understood what the human narrative memeplex is.
[11:45:43] <feep[work]> the book just almost has to turn into a twenty-page enumeration of things happening.
[11:45:50] <feep[work]> with flashes of random narrative
[11:45:56] <feep[work]> like a boltzmann brain 
[11:46:11] <saturn2> that doesn't seem like it would be fun to read. what would be the point?
[11:46:27] <feep[work]> the point is that it would be truthful to the conceit.
[11:46:39] <feep[work]> maybe the effect would be to demonstrate that the conceit is stupid :p
[11:46:54] <feep[work]> I agree with scott that this is a problem with tnc
[11:47:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: Taking the adopting of American culture a bit too far, imo...
[11:47:31] <feep[work]> but like ... I think it's a good thing the what is scp3125 chapter was removed from antimemetics

[11:48:01] <saturn2> maybe you and scott missed the point of tnc
[11:48:35] <feep[work]> idk, I feel it's too legible.
[11:49:04] <nshepperd2> the human narrative memeplex seems to be good for writing narratives
[11:49:30] <Obormot\Arcturus> TNC is that weird shit nostalgebraist wrote?
[11:49:32] <feep[work]> the whole point is that tnc becomes illegible, right?
[11:49:39] <feep[work]> Obormot\Arcturus: yeah
[11:49:46] <nshepperd2> that seems like a pointless point
[11:49:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> Everything I've ever read or heard about it makes me not want to read it
[11:49:57] <Obormot\Arcturus> Is that a mistake? Is it actually very good?
[11:50:02] <feep[work]> anyway, I feel like if the whole point is that the chesscourt memeplex becomes illegible and takes the characters along into illegibility
[11:50:13] <feep[work]> then the actual events that occur are *too legible* to support this.
[11:50:24] <feep[work]> Obormot\Arcturus: you'd probably hate it.
[11:50:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> k thx
[11:50:51] <nshepperd2> your readers can't feel the horror of a hostile meme taking over the world if they look at what you've written, go 'wtf is this', and go play vidya instead
[11:51:01] <feep[work]> there should not be horror!
[11:51:04] <saturn2> i took it as a commentary or slight parody of rationalist-ish peoples tendencies toward platonism and scrupulosity
[11:51:09] <feep[work]> the horror is before or tangential to the takeover
[11:51:21] <feep[work]> within the meme there is just X and Y and Z, which are axes *unrelated to horror, torture or suffering*.
[11:51:24] <nshepperd2> its SCP, horror is thee point
[11:51:43] <feep[work]> saturn2: I like the take that it's catholicism
[11:51:55] <saturn2> well yeah, that's almost the same thing
[11:52:00] <feep[work]> I'm just saying you don't need to read the northern caves to catch catholicism when the bible exists
[11:52:29] <feep[work]> catholicism is legible.
[11:52:38] <nshepperd2> also i disagree, i think X and Y and Z taking over the world should be horrifying too
[11:52:53] <saturn2> Obormot\Arcturus: i think it's possible you might like it. you might also hate it though idk
[11:52:55] <feep[work]> nshepperd2: right, but it can't be horrifying because ... have you read the "what is it like living in scp 3125" auxiliary chapter?
[11:53:09] <feep[work]> it can't be horrifying because scp 3125 instantiates thamiel's hell.
[11:53:22] <quanticle> feep[work]: No offense, but what the fuck are you on about
[11:53:23] <feep[work]> thamiel's hell *is* horrifying, but it's intentionally a very legible kind of horrifying
[11:53:32] <quanticle> Context?
[11:53:35] <nshepperd2> that's just you buying into method acting too hard or something
[11:53:46] <feep[work]> quanticle: the northern caves, postmodernist semi-scp horror on ao3
[11:53:51] <saturn2> Obormot\Arcturus: but it's very open to interpretation and most peoples' interpretations are imo pretty lazy
[11:53:56] <feep[work]> quanticle: also unsong, also qntm's antimemetics sequence on scpwiki (now a book!)
[11:54:15] <quanticle> Yeah, I got that part, but I don't understand what you mean about plugging characters into a random number generator and reseeding it.
[11:54:49] <feep[work]> quanticle: the point is that every "a hostile meme attacks human concepts" story I've ever read, ie. tnc and antimemetics division, *doesn't actually grapple* with the idea that the resulting plot should not be legible in terms of human memes.
[11:55:10] <nshepperd2> i disagree, it should be legible
[11:55:11] <quanticle> Oh
[11:55:27] <feep[work]> I think the only way to have a *plot* in the context of such an event is ... like, for some reason legible only to itself, things just have to go back to normal
[11:55:37] <feep[work]> thus the idea of a rng seeded so as to converge to zero, returning the story to sense
[11:56:07] <quanticle> But why do you need a RNG? And how would a RNG even work in this sense?
[11:56:09] <feep[work]> the idea is that this story would be akin to the human memeplex being hit by a random bitflip.
[11:56:14] <feep[work]> because rngs are designed to be illegible.
[11:56:14] <quanticle> What would you be randomizing?
[11:56:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: Hmm ok thx
[11:57:02] <feep[work]> quanticle: well what actually happened was I had tnc on the mind because I'd read it semi-recently, and I was reading up on rngs the past two days (pcg is apparently really good!)
[11:57:14] <feep[work]> and they semi-all have this property of "don't let the state be zero or it'll just stay zero"
[11:57:22] <feep[work]> and I thought "hang on, that might work"
[11:58:11] <feep[work]> anyway, the point is the solution cannot be that the plucky hero wins through effort and love, cough antimemetics cough
[11:58:18] <saturn2> the characters actions after mundum takes over seem perfectly adequately nonsensical to me
[11:58:25] <feep[work]> because that meme is gone, it has been fucked into oblivion
[11:58:49] <nshepperd2> it's not gone, he was immune
[11:58:49] <feep[work]> saturn2: yeah there's a phase with like ... sorting material between sky and ground, that's great, I love that
[11:59:01] <feep[work]> but then it just veers into the standard horror tropes and dies.
[11:59:06] <nshepperd2> thats the whole reason he was the viewpoint character lol
[11:59:38] <feep[work]> nshepperd2: I mean --- yes, on one hand, I agree - though what does it mean for a human to be immune to damage to the human memeplex --
[11:59:47] <feep[work]> nshepperd2: but like    it feels like surrendering the conceit.
[12:00:12] <feep[work]> like in the famous anecdote, "after X had escaped from the casket"
[12:00:20] <quanticle> What does it mean for a human to be immune to damage to the human memeplex? What makes you think that the viewpoint character was human?
[12:00:28] <nshepperd2> anyway this seems kind of like that whole postmodern thing where you think "i want to make an artwork that CHALLENGES viewers" and then you make a toilet covered with spikes or a "rape tunnel" or whatever
[12:00:44] <feep[work]> nshepperd2: I just want an artwork that is honest to the notion.
[12:01:02] <nshepperd2> and people rightly go 'that seems dumb' and go look at russian revolutionary paintings or something instead
[12:01:10] <feep[work]> if this artwork would demonstrate that the notion is fucking dumb, that's okay, if hostile meme stories are stupid I desire to believe that hostile meme stories are stupid.
[12:01:24] <nshepperd2> i want to read a story about the SCP foundation and SCP-3125, not experience SCP-3125 IRL
[12:01:48] <feep[work]> nshepperd2: it's more like there's people going "I want to make an artwork that challenges viewers" and there's just like ... a toilet covered with spikes or a rape tunnel or whatever
[12:02:12] <feep[work]> and I want to make an artwork that challenges viewers, and it's just like ... a qr code of an irreversible hash of a one-bitcoin address
[12:02:22] <feep[work]> it's pure challenge, devoid of content, thus demonstrating that this is a stupid idea and you should stop
[12:03:01] <feep[work]> it would be an antimemetics antimeme.
[12:03:05] <feep[work]> ..... :giggles helplessly:
[12:03:49] <saturn2> people never stop
[12:04:08] <feep[work]> I mean, idk. I love Scott's post about how my immortal is hermetics or whatever
[12:04:35] <feep[work]> I feel like you could ... like, you could make this broken-meme story be legible, if you included like a character key, so it wouldn't necessarily be bad reading
[12:04:54] <feep[work]> I don't think it's about, necessarily, unenjoyability. it doesn't require it.
[12:04:57] <PapuaHardyNet> nostalgebraist wrote the northern caves? huh
[12:05:12] <feep[work]> it's just that the events that occur cannot be occurring for reasons of narrative.
[12:06:42] <feep[work]> primer is great
[12:06:58] <feep[work]> it sorta has this nature, in that it has a very ... sparse narrative structure
[12:07:09] <PapuaHardyNet> antimemetics was great by the way, really enjoyed it
[12:07:25] <feep[work]> it's just an iterated application of human nature, which has the result that the things that happen happen more for physical than narrative reasons
[12:07:39] <feep[work]> things happen because the characters engage in physical acts that create affordances for them to happen.
[12:08:24] <feep[work]> and the story of primer has a straightforward narrative, but the events told are out of order with that narrative, so the ... movie-linear narrative ends up nearly unrecognizeable, even though it has a clear beginning and end
[12:08:59] <feep[work]> there's a beautiful moment towards the end where on a first watch, clearly a lot of important things have just happened and equally clearly you have missed them.
[12:10:07] <feep[work]> and the story proceeds on the force of its conceit as much as the intentional designs of the characters participating in it. to me that's the heart of science fiction.
[12:10:31] <feep[work]> so antimemetics has the central idea of "the conceit is hostile to being read".
[12:10:44] <feep[work]> I just feel this should cash out more.
[12:11:37] <feep[work]> (highest score of wasted conceit? fucking stalker. stalker is an antimemetics story! nobody notices this because the game doesn't notice it either, it just says it and moves on)
[12:11:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> wat
[12:12:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> How... is STALKER an antimemetics story
[12:12:16] <feep[work]> Obormot\Arcturus: explicitly! the zone exists because the global field of human thought is damaged.
[12:12:36] <Obormot\Arcturus> Ok? And?
[12:12:44] <Obormot\Arcturus> Why is that antimememetics necessarily?
[12:12:48] <feep[work]> so this cashes out as ..... like, there are items that make your inventory lighter
[12:12:57] <feep[work]> the global field of human thought ... is ... memes
[12:13:05] <feep[work]> like, human thought = meme
[12:13:17] <feep[work]> a meme is just a systematic thought
[12:13:37] <feep[work]> so like, which thought exactly was damaged to make a stone that heals bleeding
[12:14:12] <feep[work]> is this an item that damages the concept of "wound" in its radius?
[12:14:51] <feep[work]> this is cool! super cool! and what the game does with it is like ... fire, wind, and teleporting.

[12:17:09] <saturn2> oh okay
[12:17:24] <Obormot\Gaia> Anyway, the stone that heals bleeding does it because it projects a field that makes your red blood cells work faster or some such thing
[12:17:39] <Obormot\Gaia> It's not anything to do with any concepts
[12:17:56] <Obormot\Gaia> The game provides perfectly cromulent standard-issue sciency handwaves for things like that

[12:18:23] <feep[work]> actual ingame quote that the c consciousness spawned the zone trying to interfere with global human thought
[12:19:03] <feep[work]> I mean this is the entire reason the game has psychic damage and stuff
[12:19:39] <Obormot\Gaia> ... the game has psychic damage because there are things that project brainwaves and stuff
[12:19:50] <feep[work]> yeah like the brain scorcher
[12:19:59] <feep[work]> but like ... okay um
[12:20:30] <feep[work]> Obormot\Arcturus: let me be clear, I realize that the c consciousness shit is basically borderline fanon, because this is the optional ending and like ... as a matter of the reality of the zone your explanation is way better
[12:20:31] <Obormot\Gaia> Yes, exactly, and controllers
[12:20:42] <Obormot\Gaia> It's not just "better", it's canon
[12:20:43] <Obormot\Gaia> Look:
[12:20:45] <Obormot\Gaia> "A month later, on April 12, the experiment was performed again and this time it continued until its completion[4]. However, it did not have the desired effect - instead, the generators created a rift in the Noosphere and allowed it to directly affect the biosphere, creating a large area where physical laws were outright broken and mysterious phenomena not understood by modern science manifested themselves - the Zone.[5][6]"
[12:20:51] <feep[work]> but they wrote this! they wrote that the zone is created by memetic damage!
[12:21:02] <Obormot\Gaia> i.e., physical laws broken, therefore antigravity and teleportation and stuff
[12:21:14] <Obormot\Gaia> Perfectly ordinary stuff, no memetics, no antimemetics, no memery of any kind
[12:21:14] <feep[work]> physical laws broken *by the imposition of the noosphere*.
[12:21:23] <feep[work]> the noosphere *is the sphere of human thought*!
[12:21:28] <Obormot\Gaia> I know what it is!
[12:21:32] <feep[work]> that is why they're trying to dampen *global anger* with this experiment
[12:21:45] <Obormot\Gaia> But the noosphere broke physical laws, and THAT caused random weird shit
[12:22:00] <feep[work]> yes, but it broke it *by being affected by the noosphere*.
[12:22:00] <Obormot\Gaia> Each instance of individual weird shit has no connection to anything noospherical
[12:22:08] <feep[work]> no that's outright contradicting the text.
[12:22:12] <Obormot\Gaia> No it's not
[12:22:17] <Obormot\Gaia> The text says what I said
[12:22:18] <feep[work]> "allowed [the noosphere] to directly affect the biosphere".
[12:22:55] <feep[work]> physical laws aren't just randomly broken
[12:22:59] <Obormot\Gaia> Yes, "directly affect", by *breaking* it
[12:23:08] <feep[work]> they're broken *by being overwritten* with the sphere of human thought.
[12:23:11] <Obormot\Gaia> no.
[12:23:18] <Obormot\Gaia> "creating a large area where physical laws were outright broken" *was* the "direct effect"
[12:23:21] <Obormot\Gaia> That was it
[12:23:25] <feep[work]> okay, like, again, as fact of reality of the zone you are correct
[12:23:35] <feep[work]> because all this noosphere stuff is incredibly bolted on
[12:23:50] <Obormot\Gaia> Yes! And everything else in the game! And what this page (taken from game materials) says!
[12:23:54] <feep[work]> and you could say "radiation did it" with zero change
[12:23:58] <Obormot\Gaia> Correct!
[12:24:02] <feep[work]> but like
[12:24:04] <feep[work]> what I'm saying is
[12:24:10] <feep[work]> if you create a fucking warp rift
[12:24:15] <Obormot\Gaia> Because the noosphere stuff is just there as an explanation for why the radiation can do weird stuff
[12:24:17] <feep[work]> you should see cooler things than random teleport zones.
[12:24:39] <Obormot\Gaia> "radiation did it" "eh? can radiation really do this?" "uh, it can if it's caused by uh psychic. stuff." "oh ok then"
[12:24:41] <feep[work]> and like, a stone that makes things lighter.
[12:24:52] <Obormot\Gaia> Oh come now, that's ordinary antigravity / negative weird
[12:24:54] <Obormot\Gaia> er
[12:24:56] <Obormot\Gaia> Negative weight
[12:25:00] <feep[work]> Obormot\Gaia: honestly it just sounds like you're agreeing with me that stalker is disappointing and underwhelming to its conceit. :p
[12:25:12] <Obormot\Gaia> no.
[12:25:36] <feep[work]> I guess to rephrase, I should not be saying that stalker *is* an antimemetics story
[12:25:48] <feep[work]> but that the way they've set it up, it *should be being* an antimemetics story.
[12:26:04] <feep[work]> they pulled out a gatling gun to shoot a sparrow.
[12:26:29] <PlanckWalk> Maybe it allowed the noosphere (which includes ideas like "antigravity stones exist") to affect reality.
[12:26:34] <feep[work]> hehe
[12:26:42] <PlanckWalk> Not damage to the ideas, but damage to physical law *by* the ideas.
[12:26:44] <feep[work]> the zone is created by the stalker games impacting into reality
[12:28:03] <feep[work]> I'm just saying, I should be able to cross a chasm by shooting a gun into an anomaly and hitting the concept of "bridge" into "hole". or like. I mean, that's a bit much, but give me *something*.
[12:28:29] <feep[work]> you did not need to pull out memetics to do this!
[12:28:36] <feep[work]> roadside picnic's setup was fine!
[12:28:57] <feep[work]> how do the artifacts work? unknown physical laws that aliens understand but we don't
[12:29:14] <feep[work]> that's fine. that's good! it's not a scorcher, it's just an alien oil slick
[12:29:29] <feep[work]> the concept is adequate to the effect.

[12:34:45] <Obormot\Arcturus> Same as usual

[12:36:14] <feep[work]> if you have already broken the human concept sphere into reality, why then use it to produce an item that speeds up healing?

[12:45:17] <feep[work]> "well first there's an instruction that multiplies 32-bit numbers"
[12:45:39] <feep[work]> "and then the overflow can be used with a microcode routine that stitches three calls of the 32-bit multiplier together to multiply two 64-bit registers"
