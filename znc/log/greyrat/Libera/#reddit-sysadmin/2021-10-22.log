[10:26:26] <A-KO> welp
[10:26:29] <A-KO> I applied for a CVE :D
[10:26:31] <A-KO> this is going to be fun
[10:26:38] <A-KO> wonder if I'll have a vulnerability to my name
[10:29:09] <nobyk> oh
[10:29:24] <nobyk> yeah you pie boi
[10:29:35] <nobyk> A-KO: what score are you going for?
[10:29:49] <A-KO> dunno. It's local privilege escalation with a kernel driver
[10:29:53] <A-KO> the vendor is dumb af
[10:31:06] <A-KO> 1. Place kernel driver in user-writeable location. 2. Administratively register kernel driver in Windows that points to said user-writeable location. 3. Overwrite kernel driver in user-writeable location with whatever malicious file/driver you want. 4. ?? 5. Profit?
[10:31:25] <A-KO> Windows has pretty good protection these days around this but it's not perfect
[10:31:31] <A-KO> their driver isn't loading for one
[10:31:36] <A-KO> because it's not WHQL signed and it's not SHA256 signed
[10:31:56] <A-KO> however, older Windows installs (8/etc) don't have the WHQL signing requirement
[10:32:11] <CptLuxx> Administratively register kernel driver in Windows
[10:32:13] <A-KO> anything before Win10 1607 does not enforce WHQL signing of kernel drivers--nor systems that were upgraded from 8.1 to 10
[10:32:16] <CptLuxx> how is that a cve
[10:32:21] <CptLuxx> you already have admin rights
[10:32:41] <A-KO> CptLuxx: Because once it's registered, the file itself is writeable by a user. It doesn't actually place the file in a location that is gated by further admin actions
[10:32:53] <CptLuxx> ok....
[10:32:54] <A-KO> so it's not a CVE to register it, no. But it is if it's in a location that can be written to by the user
[10:33:22] <A-KO> like, an attacker if they knew this would not need admin rights to write over the file after the fact.
[10:33:32] <A-KO> as long as the user has this application installed
[10:33:44] <A-KO> an attacker could non-administratively write over the file with something malicious
[10:43:55] <sd> 12<🤵​♂Best Regards 🤵♂> I'm somewhat of an expert on security. I have some commits in the linux kernel
[10:47:49] <catbeard> list them sha1's
[10:48:44] <A-KO> I think Windows has pretty good protections for this these days ; but if you read the most recent malicious rootkits that were signed by Microsoft's WHQL labs ; it'd be trivial to drop one of those rootkits into this folder and have the OS load it.
[10:48:56] <A-KO> wouldn't require exploitation in the OS to do it

[13:19:28] <dunz0r> Gonna replace it with a proper router in the future... PfSense is a great firewall, but an abysmal router
[13:21:20] <xe0n> nothing wrong with it?
[13:21:23] <xe0n> i didn't say not use it haha
[13:21:43] <xe0n> would i use it? no
[13:21:55] <dunz0r> Oh right, it was teh_f4ll3n that talked to #pfsense.
[13:22:06] <xe0n> but its a common response in r-s when someone comes and ask a question about a particular product, someone goes "nah just use X"

[13:22:15] <dunz0r> Yup, haha.

[14:23:45] <yuken> slept 18 hours.

[14:26:39] <xe0n> im going to a gig tomorrow
[14:26:42] <yuken> teh_f4ll3n, well firstly, when people say "country" they usually mean "radio country", which is a horrific genre of music where 99% of the lyrics are
[14:26:48] <yuken> "my pickup, blue jeans, beer, and women"
[14:27:46] <teh_f4ll3n> that's like 90% of modern music regardless of genre though

[17:37:48] <PublicWifi> I use ubiquiti wifi's at work and home as well

[17:39:54] <sd> 02<S​ir Sceptalot> I saw that extra space too when I did my little IRC experiment the day before yesterday
[17:39:55] <PublicWifi> ah fuck
[17:39:56] <csws> weird though as the colour starts before the bracket so I'd expect a fuckup there
[17:39:56] <csws> oh well
[17:39:58] <PublicWifi> the garbage chars are back
[17:40:02] <PublicWifi> fucking rip boys i give p
[17:40:03] <sd> 02<S​ir Sceptalot> I figured you guys just dealt with it

[17:40:17] <PublicWifi> this is my relay client
[17:40:17] <sd> 09<Y​ukk> @bdenlinger I got my booze going
[17:40:23] <thegodsquirrel> I have a set of Nanostations and a set of NanoBeams that have been very good as well, but lower speed
[17:40:23] <csws> I use the lounge while at work and shit works fine there too
[17:40:24] <PublicWifi> some bs going on of well
[17:40:26] <teh_f4ll3n> Unifi has been crap for me lately
[17:40:27] <csws> works better than the GUI client in some ways..
[17:40:35] <xe0n> Phasey: mdm
[17:40:39] <csws> I get some weird glitches when discord people share nicks with IRC
[17:41:11] <bloody> publicwifi thats normal
[17:41:14] <teh_f4ll3n> I have a site with 17 APs - every time I do a rolling update, at least 2 APs don't come back and I have to re-adopt
[17:41:33] <sd> 06<P​hasey> xe0n: Just signed up for it last week waiting for it to get setup, any cons to it?
[17:41:39] <PublicWifi> bloody: just sit back and relax... everything is fine...
[17:41:49] <sd> 06<P​hasey> we currently have our phones on intune but a third party manages it and its dog shit
[17:41:49] <bloody> its because the relay send the names under this thing called "nopingnick" so that if u type on discord u dont get pinged on IRC
[17:41:54] <sd> 06<P​hasey> really annoying to deal with
[17:41:56] <bloody> i have that too on weechat
[17:42:02] <csws> ohhh
[17:42:13] <PublicWifi> you bsing me? cause you're a nice guy and i trust you
[17:42:15] <PublicWifi> LOL

[17:42:34] <PublicWifi> bout to say it doesn't happen on my main weechat instance xD
[17:42:47] <PublicWifi> :O
[17:42:52] <PublicWifi> Why does it happen bloody 
[17:42:57] <Jaelae> my wife wanted to do a rundisney race
[17:43:00] <PublicWifi> WE MUST FIND O UT
[17:43:00] <sd> 06<P​hasey> woah
[17:43:04] <Jaelae> and its crazy

[17:43:18] <PublicWifi> @Phasey come join us :D
[17:43:22] <bloody> because say i was on discord with the nickname bloody and had my IRC instance open, I would ping myself on IRC every time I sent a msg on discord
[17:43:43] <PublicWifi> oh you right
[17:43:49] <PublicWifi> okay now I can google this and fix it
[17:43:51] <PublicWifi> lol
[17:43:53] <sd> 06<P​hasey> thats really cool
[17:43:53] <PublicWifi> ty :D
[17:44:02] <bloody> The string "{NOPINGNICK}" (case sensitive) will be replaced by the actual nick / username, but with a ZWSP inside the nick, so the irc user with the same nick won't get pinged
[17:44:04] <csws> its' weird right
[17:44:16] <csws> U+2063 might work better
