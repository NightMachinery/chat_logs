[14:54:27] <deuxexmachina> on email templates for sendgrid/mailchimp/sparkpost/etc... I can't tell if they're actually universal or somehow tailored per emailing platform (smtp relay)... Do you know of a database or a good tool to generate HTML to paste into these providers? I'm tired of editing newsletter HTML
[15:12:55] <Khepra> JustSayNo(tm) to HTML in email. :)
[15:14:13] <deuxexmachina> What about those who claim the links won't get as much clicks or not as many customers will read them without pictures?
[15:14:25] <BranchPredictor> html is like violence - if it doesn't work for you, you're not using it enough
[15:14:30] <deuxexmachina> Khepra: or do you mean no HTML but still have pictures somehow?
[15:14:39] <Khepra> deuxexmachina: I heard about that but never saw any empirical stats
[15:14:40] <deuxexmachina> sarcasm here we come
[15:15:08] <BranchPredictor> deuxexmachina: but... but... TRACKING PIXELS!
[15:15:09] <Khepra> sarcasm aside, HTML in email is bad primarily because there's no standard among MUAs on how to display it
[15:15:28] <BranchPredictor> yeah, that I can agree on
[15:15:39] <Khepra> also poses security and privacy risk
[15:17:07] <deuxexmachina> The argument is bascially "attention getter"
[15:17:09] <Khepra> and speaking of empirical results. A client of ours had their HTML newsletters blocked by the likes of web.de and other similar major providers. I told them to completely drop HTML, links, images, EVERYHTING, except the Oha, here's our new relesae, plesae read it here:
[15:17:11] <deuxexmachina> aka visual stimulous
[15:17:17] <Khepra> guess what happened to deliverability to web.de and friends ;)
[15:17:33] <deuxexmachina> drawing them in, especially if the content is about what is happening in the pictures (like a martial arts newsletter)
[15:19:27] <Khepra> if you have to resort to such tricks, then your product is not good enough to sell itself on intrinsic qualities
[15:21:35] <Khepra> but back to your orig question. why do you edit newsletter HTML? don't things like mailchimp provide a WYSIWYG editor?
[15:22:27] <Khepra> and don't forget, you can't use just any HTML, and especially not CSS. no responsiveness, no floating, no fonts and colors. pure table layout with some builtin style and images is the most you can get, to have it look somewhat consistently across all the MUAs
[15:27:11] <rob0> <flash>hi</flash>
[15:27:39] <Khepra> <marquee> :)
[15:27:57] <rob0> lol
[15:30:07] <deuxexmachina> Khepra: someone did make them in mailchimp, but can i just copy & paste what it outputs into sparkpost and expect it to work?
[15:30:29] <Khepra> no idea. 
[15:30:46] <Khepra> you can always try and send yourself some newselttery goodness, see how that works.
[15:32:52] <BranchPredictor> <bgsound src="c:\windows\media\canyon.mid">
[15:33:21] <deuxexmachina> idk why this is so opaque... each provider seems to imply templates are only compatible with themselves
[15:33:23] <deuxexmachina> which makes no sense to me
[15:33:37] <deuxexmachina> https://www.sparkpost.com/blog/mandrill-template-migration-tool-mst3k/ for example Khepra 
[15:33:59] <deuxexmachina> Not to mention why would we want to migrate a template to sparkpost if sparkpost has no WYSIWYG editor?
[15:34:28] <Khepra> it's possible those are metatemplates depending on specific provider's variables and environments, then parsed and turned into final HTML at runtime
[15:35:40] <deuxexmachina> These people can't even communicate: https://www.sparkpost.com/blog/topol-html-email-templates/ their own tutorials have broken embeds
[15:43:55] <deuxexmachina> https://stripo.email/integrations/sparkpost/ maybe this is the way

[23:44:58] <Azrael_-> correct, with the error message i posted above

[23:50:13] <jaybe> Azrael_-: another option i enjoy is to send an email from appropriate test account to:  check-auth@verifier.port25.com
[23:50:32] <lunaphyte> another option from what?
[23:51:24] <jaybe> "The service allows email senders to perform
[23:51:24] <jaybe> a simple check of various sender authentication mechanisms.  It is provided
[23:51:24] <jaybe> free of charge, in the hope that it is useful to the email community.  "
[23:51:56] <jaybe> an option is an opportunity to leverage some knowledge and or tools to identify solutions and clues
[23:52:09] <Azrael_-> an email to check-auth@verifier.port25.com sent back as "everything has passed". the second option (the website) seems to have problems as the checking provides an error message and the domain test.myiptest.com can't be found if i try to send an email
[23:52:22] <jaybe> good start; keep going :)
[23:54:58] <Azrael_-> before i used the website "mail-tester.com" also tells me everything is fine. as i can't find any errors on my side i want to know if/how i could contact the other side
[23:55:14] <lunaphyte> sending an email to check-auth@verifier.port25.com is another option to sending an email to check-auth@verifier.port25.com, as the factoid mentions?
[23:58:39] <Azrael_-> any hints how i could proceed?
[23:59:40] <lunaphyte> can you pastebin the complete message contents of the reply from check-auth@verifier.port25.com?
