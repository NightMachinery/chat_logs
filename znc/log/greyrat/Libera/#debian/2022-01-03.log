[02:18:26] <TDT> Hey all.  I'm searching quite a bit for something, but am not finding what I need.  I am trying to build a custom debian setup, using a base install.  Using the tool debootstrap.  I got the majority of stuff working, minus the networking.  This'll all be in qemu, but not guaranteed not to be converted into something else (like vmware).

[02:27:18] <gothicserpent> rawtaz: yes i am using a keyring and changing /etc/apt/sources.list.d for weechat updates

[02:29:10] <TDT> rawtaz:  Well, the interface itself isn't so much of a problem, it's the deterministic nature of it.  So right now it's ens3, but a small change and it may be ens5.  My hope was to more or less say, for every interface not brought up, bring up and run dhcp on it.  I could write a wrapper script, but was hoping to avoid that.
[02:30:14] <TDT> Feels like a bit of a hack, that I'm surprised I can find such little information on.  I mean, it's not too hard to write a systemd init file that depends on networking, then when it's brought up do the loop..but still.

[02:35:06] <Khepra> TDT: you have a nondeterministic number of NICs and you want a way to dhcp them all on boot?
[02:35:49] <TDT> Pretty much.  https://serverfault.com/questions/923328/is-there-a-way-to-automatically-add-network-interfaces-to-systemd-networkd-and-o option 1 may work for this, still feels a bit like a hack, but less so than what I was thinking originally.

[02:37:22] <Khepra> TDT:  it's even in the manpage, widlcarding
[02:37:41] <Khepra> gothicserpent: hetzner
[02:38:00] * gothicserpent searches
[02:38:46] <rawtaz> gothicserpent: i can highly recommend hetzner.cloud
[02:39:08] <rawtaz> one of the best control panels ive ever seen. and their block storage is superb (it's on ceph)
[02:39:14] <rawtaz> i have a bunch of VPSs there.
[02:39:24] <Khepra> I most love the rescue system that's thorough enough to install anything you want
[02:39:33] <rawtaz> :)
[02:39:40] <Khepra> as I exclusively use ZFS atop of LUKS, it's been invaluable
[02:40:04] <rawtaz> hmm. you mean debian with LUKS for the entire disk, and ZFS on top of that? do you have a guide one can look at for that setup?
[02:40:20] <rawtaz> whats the point of LUKS there if i may ask?
[02:40:36] <rawtaz> chances that someone will steal the disks from hetzner are pretty slim i suppose :D
[02:40:39] <Khepra> no. I mean GPT partitions, LUKS plus unencrypted /boot, then zpool atop of that LUKS (mirror vdev) then debian in those pools
[02:40:53] <rawtaz> ah ok

[02:41:34] <Khepra> rawtaz: more or less this guide, but this is a bit convoluted and too wide... the core principles are in it tho:  https://openzfs.github.io/openzfs-docs/Getting%20Started/Debian/Debian%20Buster%20Root%20on%20ZFS.html

[02:42:03] <rawtaz> thanks
[02:42:04] <Khepra> rawtaz: plus GDPR mandates data encryption, so theft or not... LUKS it is
[02:42:12] <gothicserpent> what's the difference between this https://www.hetzner.com/sslzertifikate and a lets encrypt ssl cert? they both work on debian webservers i'm assuming..
[02:42:23] <rawtaz> hmm i didnt know GDPR mandates encryption
[02:42:58] <gothicserpent> i like it for my glowing bear irc frontend client so i can use ssl for irc chats in case im typing something super secret :> also my website clients sometimes get turned off if it's not ssl
[02:43:39] <Khepra> gothicserpent: I don't know if there's api/automation for hetzner's SSL. there is for LE, in abundance, so I'd just use LE. and I do, with dehydrated.
[02:43:55] <rawtaz> gothicserpent: the difference is who the CA is
[02:43:57] <gothicserpent> yep, i just certbot renew on a cronjob
[02:44:06] <gothicserpent> rawtaz: ah ok
[02:44:07] <Khepra> hetz resells enom iirc
[02:44:15] <rawtaz> apparently the hetzner certs use digicert for the CA
[02:44:24] <Khepra> ah yes, enom was domains. digicert
[02:44:38] <rawtaz> hm thawte they mention too
[02:44:51] <Khepra> I used to use digicert before LE. bestest offer in the -- then -- paid cert market. expensive, but excellent customer support and quality.
[02:45:09] <rawtaz> i always use rapidssl.com :)
[02:45:11] <rawtaz> cheap
[02:45:18] <rawtaz> but i try to use LE whenever i can and it makes sense
[02:45:24] <Khepra> yeah and they got hacked, more than once methinks
[02:45:30] <Khepra> so "you get what you pay for" :)
[02:45:36] <rawtaz> what annoys the heck out of me is all the hardware that doesnt have support for LE still
[02:45:41] <rawtaz> ah ok

[13:09:15] <DoctorD90> hello! good morning! I have a little nas that I have modded and I installed directly debian on it. 64bit arch. It is practically a mini ATX. The issue is: when i press the phisical button to shutdown, it is really to fast compare to "Sudo shutdown now" and if I run "sudo shutdown now" it is like the motherboard is still under current. I have to press the button 1 time to shutdown and another time to start (if i use the shutdown command from terminal
[13:09:15] <DoctorD90> line). Anyone has an idea on how to correctly shut it down? :)

[13:12:44] <PeteH> It has some kind of issue with ACPI
[13:13:49] <amacater_> PeteH: Try sudo poweroff -n
[13:14:08] <PeteH> but I don't wanna lol
[13:14:36] <Feuermagier> Can you guys point me to a "best practices for limiting user capabilities"? - I want to drop permissions in a Docker container and wonder how I would best limit a users inside the OS. (As in: only allowed to write to directory "/app/output", nowhere else - maybe there are even more things possible I don't know about)
[13:15:30] <amacater_> Sorry PeteH - that was for Doctor090 - the NAS is probably only suspending when the physical power button is pressed or maybe it has a double press to make sure you really want to shut down
[13:15:32] *** Joins: Anasko (~Anasko@user/wikiwide)
[13:17:45] <amacater_> Feuermagier: Can you be a bit more specific? What commands is the user allowed to run: I'd suggest you might limit them at login / via sudo but need further details
[13:18:49] <DoctorD90> PeteH, amacater_ some feature in the bios maybe? thanks to both
[13:19:07] <PeteH> Yeah I'd probably start by looking at the BIOS
[13:19:38] <Khepra> Feuermagier: what do you mean by "users"? system users (uids) or docker containers as a whole?
[13:19:59] <DoctorD90> amacater_, if i press the button to shut it down it do it (really quickly tbh - faster than shutdon now) . The double pressis required if i use the command
[13:20:02] <Feuermagier> amacater_, the python script inside the container runs chromium to scrape some sites, then ffmpeg, then auto-editor and writes into one single predefined folder.
[13:20:55] <Feuermagier> Khepra, the "user" inside the container. It's usually a good practice to not run as root inside the container - and I wonder how to limit it as far as possible.
[13:21:17] <DoctorD90> PeteH, i start trying with the command suggested :) probably in configuration phase i did some mistake in the bios xD to reduce the consumption xD

[13:22:32] <Khepra> well there's four things. seccomp filtering of the main dockerized process (docker was designed to isolate and run just one process (and it's children)), capabilities(7) and namespace constraints (uid, pid, filesystem mounts), and then there's the mother of all: mandatory access control.
[13:23:31] <Khepra> Feuermagier: the first three are likely obtainable with docker's controls/options, I'm not 100% familiar with those options, but iirc they're configurable. the last, you'll need apparmor or selinux. restricting a  process from writing into some paths is either done with namespaces (read only (bind) mounts into containers) or a MAC rule
[13:24:17] *** Joins: LucaTM (~LucaTM@user/lucatm)
[13:24:32] <Khepra> and of course the basic of all: simple unix permissions or ACLs,  (DAC rules)
[13:24:44] <Feuermagier> Khepra, couldn't I also limit where the process is allowed to write inside the container by owning/marking directories appropriately?
[13:25:27] <Khepra> Feuermagier: yes that's the unix permissions or ACLs that I mentioned
[13:25:52] <Khepra> but it's not as simple as that. that's most basic confinement but doesn't take into account what happens if there's a vulnerability and the process changes UID or gets elevated privilege
[13:26:06] <Khepra> to be thorough, you need to confine root and make it impotent

[14:56:02] <rockworld> amacater_ is it more updated then the one from the original devs ?
[14:56:06] <Khepra> DoctorD90: yes, there's more about shutdown.target and poweroff.target in systemd.special(7)
[14:56:18] <willow> rockworld: what don't you understand?  it's telling you what options to use depending upon what you need/want
[14:56:21] <DoctorD90> thanks Khepra ! I dont like the "symlink" to other function exactly for this x,D but thanks! for the moment i will search on internet
[14:56:39] <DoctorD90> Khepra, oh great! thanks! i go to check it out! cause I would like to fix it
[14:57:06] <Khepra> DoctorD90: the symlink is because systemd/systemctl is now the sole arbiter, but it detects argv[0] used and uses approporiate function
[14:57:24] <Khepra> so there's halt, there's shutdown and there's poweroff, and you can also --force (--force again) if something's stuck
[14:57:38] <rockworld> willow: you are right sorry its my french ^^ Im trying to understand I used google translator
[14:58:46] <DoctorD90> yeah, for the moment poweroff -n seems to shut it down even at hardware level
[14:58:55] <amacater_> rockworld: It is maintained by Debian developers within Debian - so it's an apt install away - maybe worth a try [It's what I'm using here right now]
[14:58:58] <rockworld> Im wondering what is a non standard ssl
[14:59:13] <DoctorD90> so Khepra I have to understand ....maybe I did some mmistake in the BIOS or there are some jumpers on the motherboard
[14:59:36] <willow> rockworld: if you don't want it installed system-wide then use the first suggestion: cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="$HOME/.local"

[15:00:19] <rockworld> thats what I was thinking

[15:01:06] <rockworld>  No CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER
[15:01:12] <rockworld> so I need this
[15:01:24] <willow> rockworld: for example it probably needs libssl-dev
[15:01:31] <amacater_> In general, if you are using Debian, use Debian packages - it may make your life easier than trying to build random things outside the Debian packaging system and, if the Debian packages work, it's much more likely that you will get support than if you build them yourself because we can reproduce problems and debug more easily

[18:13:21] <jelly> indeed.
[18:13:48] <esv> is there a way to rename eth0 <-> eth1 adapters in debian, either using udev rules or any other method?
[18:14:19] *** Joins: vxwarlock (~Darkcodex@user/vxwarlock)
[18:14:20] <Khepra> esv: yes, both. udev rules and other method (interfaces(5) can rename;   systemd-networkd .link can rename)
[18:14:36] <esv> thnx, off to the manuals.
[18:14:38] <esv> thnx
[18:15:09] <Khepra> I recommend interfaces(5) if you're using ifupdown,  networkd if you're not. custom udev rules is least recommended
[18:16:15] <esv> well, I am azure, neither might work XD
[18:16:44] <Khepra> so that's not debian?
[18:17:24] <esv> its Debian running on Azure, azure is full of azureisms
[18:17:31] <Khepra> !based on debian
[18:17:32] <dpkg> Your distribution may be based on and have software in common with Debian, but it is not Debian.  We don't and cannot know what changes were made by your distribution (compare http://futurist.se/gldt/).  #debian only supports Debian and pure <blend>s; please respect our choice to volunteer here to help Debian users.  Support for other distributions is off-topic on #debian, even if your own distro's channel is clueless or non-existent.
[18:17:51] <jkc> Debian in Azure is Debian.
[18:17:58] <Khepra> but if that is proper debian, then you have interfaces(5) as default, which may've been changed to something else by the "installation image"
[18:18:12] <jelly> jkc, who knew!
[18:18:36] <Khepra> meaning you should be able to use interfaces(5) just fine. or systemd-networkd. hypervisor doesn't in any way define which userland tool you'r use to manage the kernel network devices (which ARE defined by hypervisor)
[18:19:01] <Khepra> *you'd
[18:19:47] <Khepra> note that "proper debian" means ISOs from debian.org ;    "we took those ISOs then changed something and now you install azure.com ISOs" is not proper debian, that's !based on debian
[18:20:00] <jkc> No, it isn't. Debian is Debian.
[18:20:13] <esv> yeah, I appreciate the help folks, I expect to have to work a bit on it, but when it comes to debian I am a noobie, my expertise is centered around rhel/sles and a bit of ubuntu, but not too much

[18:20:25] <jkc> Khepra: Fuck the factoid. That's just gatekeeping nonsense.
[18:20:36] <Khepra> so here's the thing. if that IS debian, then you can normally use interfaces(5) just fine.

[18:21:03] <esv> just looking for pointers on where to start looking and what to start bending, I might need to engage product support
[18:21:08] <Khepra> if you cannot, then THAT IS NOT DEBIAN. period.

[18:24:00] <amacater_> Is azure debian actually using the cloud images from the Debian cloud team? https://wiki.debian.org/Cloud/MicrosoftAzure says maintained by credativ - who are a commercial firm employing Debian devs. It laso suggests to raise an Azure support ticket
[18:24:02] <jelly> Khepra, if that's what they got telling the platform to install Debian, then that's the closest they're going to get.  Regardless of the peculiarities.
[18:24:28] <jelly> I'd consider stuff from credativ actual debian
[18:24:51] <Khepra> I think we're missing the important bits here. it's one thing that some debian images use NM becasuse that's how they're set up by default. that's fine. doesn't preclude the ability to use ifupdown or networkd.
[18:25:03] <esv> not mine, one of the developers has an appliance based on debian and is making my life miserable, I am trying to help but my "debian" knowledge is very limited so I was asking for pointers.
[18:25:11] <amacater_> jelly: So would I - but I bow to the suggestion to raise trouble ticket via Azure in case
[18:25:13] <esv> I expect to so a lot of experimenting
[18:25:23] <jelly> oh, that's pretty much what wiki says
[18:26:01] <Khepra> esv: so you're "asking for a friend"? :)
[18:26:04] <jelly> "images were under credativ up until Debian 9, from 10 on they're under publisher Debian"
[18:26:25] <esv> lol - I am with azure support :D
[18:26:38] <Khepra> jelly: so that's proper debian, just configured with some default OOtB
[18:26:53] <Khepra> esv: is this your system where you can try out things?
[18:27:00] <amacater_> https://cloud.debian.org/images/cloud/ says that too :) Wiki not consistent :(
[18:27:22] <esv> but we can't possibly know everything, the developer has some weird ass image and has a stupid requirement to talk to the azure metadata server via a secondary adapter
[18:27:43] <Khepra> esv: is this your system where you can try out things?
[18:28:35] <esv> oh hell yeah, I have a personal box where I can try shit on kvm and an azure paid subscription we use to break things. no production workload runs there

[18:28:48] <amacater_> esv: Get the developer to give you details of what's in his image and replicate
[18:29:01] <Khepra> esv: so you're then asking for your system, how to rename ethX in to ethY ?
[18:29:44] <amacater_> If his image is not one of the cloud teams images ask him to replicate on one of them ...
[18:30:12] <esv> pretty much to see if that does the trick for him, will try the interfaces thing although cloud-init and other crap might interfere
[18:30:57] <Khepra> right, so the issue is whether there's processes that alter confing regardeless of how you set it up from inside the image.
[18:31:20] <Khepra> that part was not clear until now.
[18:31:25] <esv> right, as I said, I expect to do a lot of experimenting, just looking at where to start.
[18:31:29] <jelly> esv, which debian release is this.  Is networking.service enabled and active.
[18:31:42] <esv> debian 10 I believe
[18:32:05] *** Joins: frmlof (~frmlof@12.50.11.83)
[18:32:14] <jelly> /etc/network/interfaces is the config file for that service, and is the usual way to set up networking on debian but far from the only one
[18:32:47] <jelly> also: /etc/network/interfaces.d/* if existing
[18:33:16] <Khepra> also important to note, cloud init things _could_ be evicted from the image, if the hypervisor environment permits it (doesn't hard require it to operate)
[18:33:19] <esv> ok, will take a look and see what happens, thank you a lot folks.  now off to experimenting
[18:33:45] <Khepra> I don't know if that's possible under azure, but I've evicted a lot of cloud init carp from other providers default images.
[18:33:47] <amacater_> esv: It's probably in order to go back to the person, say that you've raised it with the volunteers here :) and that you really need more info to double down on where the problem lies. We're nagging at you to try and second guess what the heck could be wrong :)
[18:33:52] <esv> yeah, it is not a hard requiement, I believe his image does not even run the linux agent.

[18:36:23] <esv> thank you folks, I really appreciate the info.

[18:37:58] <jelly> https://wiki.debian.org/NetworkInterfaceNames mostly deals with new en* "predictable interface names"
[18:37:59] <Khepra> jelly: iirc you can match by mac and then rename for that match
[18:38:19] <jelly> Khepra, sure, but how precisely and does that work in buster?
[18:38:35] <Khepra> I can't speak from experience, on that one.
[18:38:51] <Khepra> these days I prefer systemd-networkd as it's most versatile and very easy to use.
[18:39:08] <jelly> also, you can use the arch linux wiki for all the docs
[18:39:19] <Khepra> now that's sad :))
[18:39:55] <jelly> a lot better than upstream docs for almost any systemd component
[18:40:10] <amacater_> arch wiki is generally the best documented - keen users and willing to share knowledge - answer is for us Debian users to do more :)

[22:09:10] <blinux> greycat, OK, the KDE printer add tool is asking me to login as root. But I think I don't have a root account setup. I didn't create one when I installed debian. So, that must have been what adding the users to the lpadmin helped with.

[22:12:12] <blinux> Ah, OK. I think I skip root password setup because if you set a password during install then it doesn't add your user to the suduers, but you easily do that with visudo.

[22:16:29] <blinux> However, wouldn't it make better sense if KDE asked me to login with admin using sudo rights?

[22:18:15] <greycat> I'm definitely not a KDE guy, but that sounds like an alternative to sudo.  But CUPS is normally configured through a web interface, using HTTP Basic Auth.  If you supply the root password in the web interface, you'll be able to do stuff.  Otherwise you'll have to supply a name and password of someone in the lpadmin group.
[22:18:40] <blinux> I can however run systemsettings5 from the terminal with sudo and it looks like I no longer get prompted to login as root.
