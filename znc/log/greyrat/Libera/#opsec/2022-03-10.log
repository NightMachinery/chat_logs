[03:56:45] <Joanna> Wearing clothes with metal screens or aluminum foil in them might be a good idea but publicly protesting where you can be targeted is not. The police can always just resort to bullets if need be.
[04:00:10] <Joanna> The people responsible for promoting peaceful protests are the same ones who are responsible for the problems that people are wanting to protest about . In other words it’s a win win situation in the war against the public..

[04:22:18] <jan6> 02:02 <Joanna> Does anyone know what would make tabs in a browser revert back to what they were
[04:22:25] <jan6> losing your session info, obviously
[04:23:30] <Joanna> What would cause that ?
[04:23:51] <jan6> it not being saved, duh
[04:24:03] <jan6> probably by running out of space, or out of power
[04:25:08] <jan6> although firefox saves it enough that even if you completely abruptly cut out power, it can still restore (possibly minus one or two tabs, if they were still loading during the cutout)
[04:25:23] <jan6> idk how often chrome saves it
[04:25:31] <Joanna> Strange :)
[04:26:00] <Joanna> Where did the previous session info come from?
[04:26:11] <jan6> the browser profile, of course
[04:26:39] <jan6> which, changing that, would also "reset session" visually, since all the open tabs data would be in a different profile
[04:28:31] <jan6> usually the profile data is persistent though, and new profiles don't get automatically created unless there's no suitable ones (e.g. development or beta versions of a browser may store profiles in same folder, just with a different name, like as14va-developer-edition-default vs dh1i5-default)
[04:28:42] <jan6> (just BS names to illustrate the point)
[04:28:45] <Joanna> Good thing the history wasn’t lost..
[04:29:02] <jan6> if you can't do a session restore, then weird
[04:30:12] <Joanna> I was wondering if it was because I was watching rt live stream on YouTube...
[04:30:41] <jan6> nah
[04:31:23] <jan6> I mean, websites can't manipulate the session data, it'd be a HUGE vulnerability if they could
[04:31:34] <jan6> not the "open tabs" data, at least
[04:31:54] <jan6> nor can the change browser settings
[04:32:13] <Joanna> Who knows what is possible:)
[04:32:28] <jan6> using exploits, maybe
[04:32:59] <jan6> but pulling off custom exploits through a live chat without getting filtered, is gonna be REAL tricky, lol
[04:33:37] <Joanna> Rt is unreachable today
[04:34:05] <Joanna> I guess someone wants to save me from “misinformation “
[04:34:16] <jan6> nah
[04:34:43] <Joanna> I wonder who is ddosing it
[04:34:57] <jan6> the ones doing that have taken action already, the people bringing the sites down are just random dudes trying to send a message of "f*k russia, we don't like you"
[04:35:26] <jan6> it's not that hard to just buy ddos
[04:37:06] <Joanna> People who have computers making ddos attacks should have their internet shut off...
[04:37:44] <jan6> it's back up
[04:37:47] <Joanna> Unless they are attacking something I don’t like
[04:37:52] <Joanna> Heh
[04:37:59] <jan6> that's the mentality of everyone, lol
[04:38:17] <jan6> but too bad half their devices are random people's routers, phones, and smart fridges ;P
[04:38:28] <jan6> and RGB led bulbs
[04:38:35] <jan6> and whatnots
[04:38:58] * jan6 slep
[04:39:08] <Joanna> But still it isn’t right to use other people’s stuff as weapons
[04:40:03] <Joanna> I color revolution is just a ddos attack using fleshbots instead of computers..

And then it will be discovered that someone exposed to bio weapon pathogens got on a plane and traveled to another continent ...

[17:12:01] <JimBuntu> Good morning Joanna. Yup, it can be a serious problem when control is lost over any biolab.  In this case, I think it was 5-6 last I heard.  There are bound to be some number that we don't know about as well. Same issue with non-biological materials as well... could be chemical or could be radioactive in nature.  Facilities otherwise 'secure' are no longer.

[23:14:26] <Roey> MiningMarsh is now here though \o/ so I am rejoicing
[23:31:46] <JimBuntu> YAY... does this work in reverse jan6 ... making Tetris free of it's issues?
[23:32:46] <jan6> The Tetris Company, LLC is based in Hawaii and is owned by Henk Rogers, Alexey Pajitnov and Blue Planet Software. The company is the exclusive licensee of Tetris Holding LLC, the company that owns Tetris rights worldwide.
[23:32:51] <jan6> so, y'know, not really
[23:33:35] <JimBuntu> yeah, but they stole it... and since nothing matters any more, including previously agreed on treaties and stuff... I hereby declare that I own everything Tetris, and all of Russia ;p
[23:34:53] <jan6> stole how?
[23:35:20] <jan6> also, lmao, "TTC drew attention in the late 1990s when it attempted to remove freeware and shareware versions of Tetris from the market by sending out cease-and-desist letters claiming both trademark and copyright infringement,[10] having copyrighted and trademarked every aspect of Tetris, such as the playfield dimensions, the next piece, and the shapes of the blocks"
[23:35:31] <JimBuntu> The game was actually a byproduct of the Russian government, iirc.  But I was only making a joke
[23:35:54] <jan6> how so?
[23:36:04] <jan6> also, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris
[23:36:08] <JimBuntu> Too much for me to talk about, check out the history of the game
[23:36:49] <jan6> first paragraph already says that it's owned by the same guy who created it, tbh
[23:39:52] <jan6> no mention of government at all
[23:44:43] <JimBuntu> Well... that Soviet Academy of Sciences was the government.
