[03:38:10] <Jong> Which word do you prefer to use for a single input-output pair? "example" or "sample" ?
[03:38:38] <Jong> would it matter whether the input-output pair was ground truth used for training, or simply an input and the corresponding inference output?
[03:39:46] <Jong> maybe an input-output ground truth pair is called an example, while an input & corresponding inference output is called a sample?
[03:40:22] <Jong> Also, is the input data also considered "activation values" ?

[14:28:21] <sobobobobo> hi! im learning about a policy  gradients. I understood that a policy is a probability distribution \pi_{\theta}(a,s)
[14:29:38] <sobobobobo> so can i think an action as a random variable?

[17:23:25] <xs> HuntsMan: really? i'd be curious to hear of any paper discussing the convergence of e.g., policy iteration, that takes this view. the policy is a conditional probability mass/density function.
[17:23:53] <xs> it must be defined this way, in order that the markov chain makes sense.
[17:24:38] <xs> the mistake in sobobobobo's question, the policy is pi_theta(a|s), i.e., it's conditional on the state s.
[17:24:51] <xs> the action a and state s are both random variables.
[17:26:44] <xs> this is because the MDP forms a markov chain over all of the random variables (states, actions, rewards): p(s_0)p(a_0|s_0)p(r_0|s_0, a_0) prod_t p(s_t|s_{t-1})p(a_t|s_t)p(r_t|s_t, a_t).
[17:27:42] <xs> by making time invariant assumptions on the parameterisations of this markov chain, we can identify p(a_t|s_t) with the policy.
[17:32:27] <HuntsMan> yes, this is the theoretical aspect, I was being more practical :)
[17:39:11] <xs> ok, i see.
