[00:17:47] <El_Che> Desired skills: - German language :)
[00:17:58] <daxim> could be worse
[00:18:34] <El_Che> if I squint a little I can read it, I speak dutch :)
[00:21:10] <daxim> I have visited nl about a dozen times and will reflect that notion ü§ù
[00:21:50] <El_Che> when there keep driving south and you'll meet my blend of dutch (Belgium, Flanders)
[00:22:09] <El_Che> I sould like lizmat, but more polite :P
[00:26:07] <lizmat> but less direct :-)
[00:26:28] <El_Che> :P

[04:06:29] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> I mean using a magic variable as your parameter
[04:06:47] <Od1n> <sym> is an alternative for a term in a grammar
[04:07:15] <Od1n> when you declare a action class, you have to keep the same name for the rule and the method

[16:01:20] <frost> tbrowder thanks, i know why it fails, since there is no META6.json, now I try to add one
[16:02:44] <tbrowder> frost: you should investigate using App::Mi6 for module creation and maintenance--saves a lot of work
[16:03:01] <discord-raku-bot> <RaycatWhoDat#0001> When making a grammar, what is the correct way to look for delimited block if the delimiters are on separate lines?
[16:03:27] <tbrowder> lizmat uses it, and i too, and many others
[16:04:33] <frost> tbrowder thank you, but i haven't learn how to make a module, i‚Äòll try later

[18:31:22] <patrickb> CIAvash: That's not optimal. But my point was not about the program not existing, but the `try` being uneffective.
[18:39:48] <ugexe> the process errors when it gets sunk
[18:39:49] <tellable6> 2021-11-19T10:54:07Z #raku <tbrowder> ugexe zef is noticeably faster now, nice!
[18:40:01] <ugexe> if you avoid sinking it it wont error 
[18:41:21] <ugexe> m: my $a = try run("nonexisting"); say $a.exitcode
[18:41:22] <camelia> rakudo-moar 254a9cb33: OUTPUT: ¬´1‚ê§¬ª
[18:43:12] <patrickb> but then I can leave the try off just as well
[18:43:31] <patrickb> is this an error vs exception thing?
[18:43:33] <ugexe> yep, you'd `try` around whatever would sink it
[18:43:56] <tbrowder> patrickb: thnx for the reminder. i assume it‚Äôs WAT instead of WHAT due to raku mop and it‚Äôs also comedic and phonetic!
[18:44:38] <patrickb> Ah, so the error (aka a contact bomb) passes through the try untouched as it's not a live exception and then gets sunk which triggers it?
[18:45:06] <ugexe> yea, although it might be a failure not an exception (i forget)
[18:46:04] <patrickb> thanks for explaining!
[18:46:10] <patrickb> tbrowder: I guess so.

[23:35:06] <Skarsnik> maybe should clarify the error message?

[23:36:25] <ugexe> "Please note that a 'META6.json' file was found in '.', of which the 'provides' section was used to determine if a dependency is available or not.
