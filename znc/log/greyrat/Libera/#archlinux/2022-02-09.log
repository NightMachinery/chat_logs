[00:05:19] <Earnestly> You can update glibc locally if you want, without rebuilding toolchain.  It shouldn't break due to glibc guarantees

[03:24:30] <jtgd> my install failed. I must have missed a step. I have 4 wiki pages open and head was spinning, so I ran archinstall. That seemed to go smooth, and I rebooted into the new system, but now it says I'm in "emergency mode" and I'm not sure why or what to do.
[03:24:55] <MacGyver> And this is why friends don't let friends run archinstall.
[03:24:58] <Namarrgon> i would recommend the "regular" Installation Guide, not archinstall
[03:25:04] <MacGyver> Does it say *why* you're in emergency mode?

[03:25:21] <jtgd> no
[03:25:28] <MacGyver> What *does* it say?
[03:25:57] <MacGyver> (I haven't been in emergency mode in ages but I hope it doesn't clear the terminal)
[03:25:57] <jtgd> it suggests I run journalctl -xb

[03:33:16] <jtgd> yeah fstab has dups
[03:33:31] <MacGyver> The issue is going to be with the configuration files you touched yourself, and then had archinstall configure.

[03:51:45] <CoffeeMuffin> When playing videos from any source (mpv,totem,firefox and surf is what I tried) the picture is tearing. I tried to fix that problem by installing xf86-video-intel (I have i5-11500) and adding this (http://ix.io/3P5c) to /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/20-intel.conf. It worked but, instead only videos played with mpv and totem, not firefox, freezed. When resizing the window the video updates. If I want the
[03:51:48] <CoffeeMuffin> video to play I have to keep resizing. The freeze fix on the arch wiki intel graphics page does not work either. Do you have an idea what I could try next?

I checked the other answers in your link - I added the dbus launching lines to my .zshenv but that did not work.

[08:31:33] <jbg> obviously i'm aware that all official packages will have arch=('i686' 'x86_64') so i'll need to patch the PKGBUILDs of the packages and potentially need to modify the actual build for some too

[10:21:42] <feinedsquirrel> Not specifically arch, but I'm running on arch. Wondering why/how nginx (running as the user "http") can access my letsencrypt ssl certs when they reside in a folder than is specifically created with only "dwrx------ root root" permissions?
[10:23:06] <ds> does nginx itself run as http or just the worker processes? wonder if parent is root and that handles the certs on behalf of child procs or something

[10:29:45] <feinedsquirrel> yeah, it seems you may be right. Worker processes are run under the http user. I'm not as familiar with the "ps aux...." command, can it be used to find which user is controlling a process? e.g. find if root really is running nginx? ... Oh, Thanks jaawerth:!

[10:30:29] <mpan> ds: don’t worry. Half of answers here is based on educated guesses from people who more or less recall something related to the qeustion. :)
[10:30:44] <jaawerth> `ps aux | grep nginx` should at least list one process that says "master" and is root and others that say "worker" and are http or whatever you've configued it to use
[10:31:00] <jaawerth> it needs root to bind to privilged (< 1000) ports
[10:31:09] <ds> rofl, noted mpan! thanks for the context too, would not have thought to link that 
[10:31:31] <jaawerth> unless you do something wacky with authbind etc
[10:31:34] <mpan> You may also use htop. In tree view you will see the parent of the worker processes.

Just tinkering around with nginx configs this evening and realized this gap in permissions (and owners). jaawerth: that sounds like a "fun" problem to have solved. a good line for your resume?
[10:34:59] <ds> ps knowhow comes with time, have a skin through man ps - there's a few different combos and you can change the output columns, get full command or just the process, etc etc

[23:49:45] <seventyfour> Warepire: I've only tried reverting the above two commits so far
[23:49:57] <seventyfour> I think maybe one of those was one you also suggested?
[23:50:02] <Tamwyn> oh, good that you mention it, it crashed again.
[23:50:40] <TheSilentLink> Tamwyn: are you referring to my comment?

[23:52:30] <seventyfour> Oh you mentioned https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/drivers/usb/typec?id=9990f2f6264cd19cb6ba12d9f9c1c30ae8351096
[23:52:31] <phrik> Title: kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git - Linux kernel source tree (at git.kernel.org)
[23:53:14] <seventyfour> I can try reverting that one too
[23:53:19] <seventyfour> was there another?
[23:53:20] <Tamwyn> TheSilentLink: yes
[23:53:37] <TheSilentLink> Tamwyn: I can't even login it crashes right after the login screen
[23:53:57] <TheSilentLink> I have a core dump
[23:54:11] <Tamwyn> it crashed immediately after startup and then again in the last 20 minutes, but ran for probably 4h. I updated yesterday.
[23:54:29] <TheSilentLink> I just updated a few minutes ago.
[23:54:34] <TheSilentLink> Something has broken it
[23:55:40] <TheSilentLink> that said I haven't used it in a couple days

[23:58:39] <TheSilentLink> I guess we just have to wait for an update?
[23:58:51] <Warepire> seventyfour: Yes, that one. I looked up your laptop after you left last time I was here, you do have that typec controller.
[23:59:01] <TheSilentLink> electron15 hasn't been updated since last month so I don't think it's related to that package
[23:59:25] <Warepire> seventyfour: Based on the link in the commit log, there's another commit related to that one, trying to find it.
