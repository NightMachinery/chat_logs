[17:47:15] <dakkar> demostanis[m]: that's because you're checking if 'cid' is in *the return value of `say`*
[17:47:22] <dakkar> and that's not what you mean
[17:47:39] <dakkar> remove the inner `.say`, and it should work

[18:11:45] <demostanis[m]> <dakkar "demostanis: that's because you'r"> I already tried, it does the same
[18:13:13] <dakkar> demostanis[m]: ok, you *also* miss a loop
[18:14:08] <demostanis[m]> Where?
[18:15:04] <dakkar> inside the inner gather
[18:15:08] <dakkar> that `if` runs only once
[18:15:35] <demostanis[m]> That's what it's supposed to do?
[18:15:48] <dakkar> sorry, yes, sort of, I had mis-read the regex
[18:17:36] <demostanis[m]> It's saying 'cid' is not in the gathered list
[18:18:54] <dakkar> https://pastebin.com/Q5cR03A7
[18:19:16] <dakkar> you were taking the stringification of a match containing multiple sub-matches
[18:19:38] <dakkar> so instead of <<hcl eyr pid>>, you were taking 'hcl eyr pid'
[18:20:01] <dakkar> so the ∈ failed
[18:20:08] <demostanis[m]> Oh rightt.
[18:20:22] <dakkar> `take $_ for $0.list>>.Str` works (there may well be a prettier way to do that)

[18:24:52] <demostanis[m]> What does ~$0 exactly do? Why does it convert a match to all matches?
[18:25:06] <demostanis[m]> It seems like it does
[18:27:19] <moritz> the ~ just converts the $0 to a string
[18:27:44] <moritz> and $0 is the same as $/[0], so the first positional capture of a match object
