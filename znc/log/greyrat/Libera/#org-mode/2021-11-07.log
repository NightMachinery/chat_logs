[03:06:14] <icole> hey everyone, I was hoping to get some help to point me in the right direction after wracking my brain trying to figure out how to figure this out. I am trying to create a custom view in org-agenda with org-agenda-custom-commands. When using (org-agenda-span 1) it doesn't seem to default to "today", but instead the first day of the week span. When I hit "." it jumps me to today. Is there a way to force it to default? I have been
[03:06:14] <icole> scouring the docs, but I feel like maybe I am missing something right under my nose.

[03:08:18] <icole> I am setting it to 1. which does seem to reduce the view to just one day, just not the current day
[03:09:09] <jtgd> hmmmm... because setting to 'week will align it to the first day of the week etc
[03:09:29] <jtgd> if you examine that variable is that what it is?

[03:12:06] <jtgd> what was the value?
[03:12:56] <icole> it says 10, but I am assuming thats the default? I am explicitly settings it when defining a custom view

[03:13:30] <jtgd> seems like something else is setting it
[03:14:12] <icole> changing it in there does work. for example if I change it to 2, it will show me 2 days in the Agenda, but it doesn't start from today. It starts last Wednesday
[03:15:40] <jtgd> I've never done a custojm view, but there are other variables that might affect it. Did you read the Org manual?
[03:16:58] <icole> yes, I went through everything here https://orgmode.org/manual/Custom-Agenda-Views.html and am trying to search for where else there might be documentation but thats where I am hitting a wall.

[03:24:54] <jtgd> maybe string "today"
[03:25:04] <jtgd> maybe 0 ?
[03:25:23] <icole> "+0d" looks like it works. 0 set it to Jan 1st. Thanks!
[03:25:23] <jtgd> maybe set it nil. I would think today is default

[17:32:33] <gnoo> greyrat: you could use org-next-block and org-narrow-to-block then use write-region to write to a file
[17:33:59] <greyrat> Yes, but should I send a patch to org-mode to enable tangling example blocks?
[17:34:12] <greyrat> I.e., is there any reason this should not be the default behavior?
[17:40:58] <gnoo> greyrat: the manual only talks about tangling source code blocks. so it's weird. maybe there is a reason specified on the mailing lists...
[17:42:53] <yewscion> greyrat: What context do You need for tangling example blocks? I've used fundamental, conf-unix, and text code blocks when I've needed to tangle those things before, and that works fine.
[17:43:34] <yewscion> I think the idea behind only targeting code blocks for tangling stems from the concept of literate programming, where the tangled files are the pure source code of the project.
[17:44:46] <greyrat> yewscion: You are suggesting I use a fundamental src block as a substitute for an example block? That could work, but I'll lose the highlighting. (I currently use shell blocks.)
[17:45:28] <greyrat> I actually see literate programming as more in line with using example blocks; The only way to run the code is to use the tangled files, and you can't use org-babel to run the source blocks.
[17:46:12] <yewscion> I can definitely see that perspective. Honestly, I think it makes sense to be a non-default option to tangle any kind of block.

[17:47:03] <yewscion> Is it shell code? Because both sh and bash code blocks might work. The highlighting comes from the modes in emacs already; You can basically just put the ****-mode without the -mode as a code block type, and it will highlight appropriately, to my understanding.

[17:58:13] <yewscion> You can put a header argument to disable all source code block eval in a file: 
[17:58:21] <yewscion> #+PROPERTY: header-args :eval never
[17:58:54] <yewscion> I think there is a way to do it globally, for every file, as well. Though I've never messed with that setting myself.
