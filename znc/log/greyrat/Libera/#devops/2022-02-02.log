[02:27:04] <slaughter> The `strings` command finds the printable strings in a binary file. It is helpful to see any strings like URLs or addresses embedded in a file.
[02:27:13] <slaughter> And today I learned something new
[02:27:18] <slaughter> And it is rad af
[02:27:46] <rawtaz> you learnt that today? :D
[02:30:31] <slaughter> Yeah never seen it before
[02:30:35] <slaughter> Bit green behind the ears I guess
[02:31:06] <slaughter> `cat binaryfile | subl` and then pick through has worked well enough for my needs in the past so I haven't gone searching
[02:32:06] <rawtaz> there will always be things one doesnt know about that just passed by since like 20 years :>
[02:32:33] <rawtaz> subl, whats that? the Sublime text editor?
[02:32:37] <slaughter> Aye
[02:33:10] <slaughter> I like it for generic text reading/light manipulation
[02:34:07] <rawtaz> another little gem is the `at` command, which however was replaced by something else but still the same type of thing. with that you can set a timer for a command that turns off/opens the firewall for you in e.g. 2 minutes, right before you make some changes to a firewall. if you mess up, youll be able to connect anyway once the timer expires. if you dont mess up, youll just cancel the timer
[02:34:37] <slaughter> Oh hey that is a little gem
[02:35:26] <slaughter> I grew up on windows with some light linux futzing (very little CLI), so my actual unix and unix tool knowledge is admittedly limited
[02:35:44] <rawtaz> i learnt about the xxd command like a couple of weeks ago. always was missing a hex display thing lol
[02:35:47] <kwilczynski> slaughter: Don't worry. I know nothing!
[02:35:49] * kwilczynski pokes rawtaz 
[02:35:51] <rawtaz> ooh ok
[02:36:19] * rawtaz fists kwilczynski discretely
[02:36:22] <rawtaz> hello
[02:36:29] <rawtaz> played Worms Armageddong again today
[02:36:35] <slaughter> Eh if I was really worried about it I'd just compare myself to a programmer :)
[02:36:41] <rawtaz> im thinking of naming one of my worms after you kwilczynski :D
[02:36:48] <kwilczynski> AMAZING!
[02:37:01] <kwilczynski> I want to be the smart one, with machine gun.
[02:37:11] <kwilczynski> slaughter: I compare myself to a potato. :)
[02:37:29] <rawtaz> kwilczynski: haha ok
[02:37:34] <kwilczynski> slaughter: This leaves no room for any possible dissappointment. The bar is low!
[02:37:39] <rawtaz> kwilczynski: i *will* name one of them with your nick :)
[02:37:42] <slaughter> lolololol
[02:37:47] <rawtaz> and ill try to use the uzi as much as possible with it :)
[02:37:54] <kwilczynski> rawtaz: OK!
[02:37:59] <slaughter> My dog is named Potato. She is dumber than the average cooking potato. So lower that bar a little bit
[02:38:10] <kwilczynski> MY GOD! So there is lower bar.
[02:38:11] <kwilczynski> :/
[02:38:14] <rawtaz> slaughter: if she's that dumb, she must be incredibly cute
[02:38:19] <kwilczynski> I've been lied to.
[02:38:22] <slaughter> SHE IS
[02:38:25] <slaughter> She's so cute
[02:38:30] <kwilczynski> I AM CUTE TOO.
[02:38:33] <kwilczynski> (my mom tells me)
[02:38:33] <slaughter> It almost makes up for how stupid and crazy she is
[02:38:45] <slaughter> Do you also need treats kwilczynski 
[02:38:59] <kwilczynski> slaughter: Sure I do.  White chocolate.
[02:39:01] <kwilczynski> Mmm...
[02:39:06] <kwilczynski> :>
[02:39:32] <slaughter> In this house there's treats for going outside, treats for coming back in, treats for not biting anyone, treats for going to bed, treats for peeing on other dogs' pee, treats for tricks (she actually does know many, despite being an idiot)...lots of treats
[02:39:41] <slaughter> No, sorry, they're blueberry or pumpkin
[02:40:05] <slaughter> And occasionally the CBD ones that I think are dirt flavored but I'm not brave enough to find out
[02:40:07] <kwilczynski> slaughter: Actually. I think she's very smart.
[02:40:11] <rawtaz> slaughter: a pic never hurts :-)
[02:40:12] <kwilczynski> slaughter: Look at what you just said.
[02:40:21] <slaughter> lol true
[02:40:22] <kwilczynski> slaughter: I think she learned how to game the system.
[02:40:36] <slaughter> Yeah just poop on the floor and bite people long enough and they'll reward you for not
[02:40:39] <kwilczynski> slaughter: And it's abusing your keenness to give her snacks.
[02:40:40] <rawtaz> slaughter: ouch sounds like an awfully badly managed dog :P
[02:40:47] <kwilczynski> Damn one smart best.
[02:40:48] <slaughter> And do that occasionally still just to prove the point
[02:40:50] <kwilczynski> beast*
[02:41:08] <rawtaz> she's in total control
[02:41:20] <rawtaz> and you called her dumb, lol
[02:41:25] * kwilczynski leaves some white chocolate on rawtaz's carpet and runs away
[02:41:36] <rawtaz> she's so smart it's not on your scale, thats why you dont see it :)
[02:41:39] <kwilczynski> rawtaz: Yeah, she owns her cuman.
[02:42:10] <slaughter> https://imgur.com/a/a0GyGHR
[02:42:36] <slaughter> Eh you should see her try to figure out literally anything
[02:42:47] <kwilczynski> So.
[02:42:48] <slaughter> If it's not got food as a motivator it's just beyond her
[02:42:51] <rawtaz> awwww
[02:43:06] <kwilczynski> What are we up to today?
[02:43:12] <slaughter> Pretending to work
[02:43:14] <slaughter> Kinda working
[02:43:18] <slaughter> That's 'bout it
[02:43:26] <rawtaz> i like that you have a climbing rope for her :-)
[02:43:30] <kwilczynski> Didn't you just get a new job?
[02:43:46] <slaughter> Yeah don't start til next month though. Finishing up my term at old job
[02:43:52] <kwilczynski> Ah.
[02:43:55] <kwilczynski> Got it.
[02:44:19] <slaughter> rawtaz it's a leash, but it's made of climbing rope. A bit big for her but it's really nice on hikes because there's 0 chance of it snapping if she fell off a cliff or something (she's tried in the past)
[02:45:02] <kwilczynski> Ahh.
[02:45:07] <slaughter> Her thought process when she encounters a barrier to her forward movement is usually "uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh" for 10 seconds followed by total commitment to blind forward progress
[02:45:09] <kwilczynski> OK. I had enough beating for the day.
[02:45:16] * kwilczynski switches off Witcher 3
[02:45:33] <kwilczynski> Death March... 
[02:45:45] <rawtaz> heh
[02:45:52] <kwilczynski> Stupid Nekker killed me with a single blow.
[02:45:53] <kwilczynski> ;s
[02:46:02] <kwilczynski> It's going to take a while to complete it on this difficulty.
[02:46:06] <kwilczynski> :)
[02:46:06] <slaughter> Oh damn I was supposed to go on a run 15 minutes ago
[02:46:14] <slaughter> later y'all gotta go sweat a bit
[02:46:14] <kwilczynski> slaughter: RUN RUN!
[02:46:15] <kwilczynski> :P
[02:46:23] <slaughter> :)
[02:46:32] * kwilczynski gives slaughter a snack! RUN!
[02:46:44] <slaughter> I'm going I'm going!
[02:47:52] <rawtaz> running is so boring
[02:49:02] <kwilczynski> rawtaz: I liked it. When I could.
[02:49:07] <kwilczynski> rawtaz: It's quite relaxing.
[02:49:11] <kwilczynski> Good for the mind.
[02:52:29] <rawtaz> i bet it's nice and great if you just get into it yeah

[17:44:25] <rawtaz> sooo. influx or something else for injesting data from telegraf agents and visualising using grafana?
[17:44:31] <rawtaz> in mean influxdb of course
[17:45:12] <rawtaz> i like influx because they have that awesome telegraf agent configuration in their GUI.. but ive read not little about how people think that influx isnt stable when it comes to upgrades etc, that they change too much without backwards compatibility and what not. or that was just when going v1 -> v2, i duno.
[17:47:23] <Deknos> i didn't like influx, because for ha-influx you have to pay. and telegrad also can publish the collected data. but yeah telegraf is really cool
[17:48:07] <Deknos> and apparently it's real easy to write an telegraf plugin
[17:48:37] <rawtaz> i love telegraf, really dont want to not use it.. :)
[17:48:39] <gordonjcp> I need to get into TIG
[17:48:41] <rawtaz> yeah probably.
[17:48:53] <rawtaz> gordonjcp: super simple to get running :)
[17:48:57] <gordonjcp> I'm not really monitoring much at the moment
[17:49:37] <rawtaz> Deknos: what "stack" do you use? :)
[17:50:21] <rawtaz> FWIW im talking about small infra where you dont need any of the paid stuff or HA, just need to monitor a bunch of servers, devices, services eetc.
[17:50:43] <Deknos> as i gave in my notice two weeks ago, none atm. my homestuff is not really monitored. but at my last job we used nagios and icinga (nagios was in the process of switching off), prometheus, influx and telegraf
[17:50:50] <Deknos> and some exporters
[17:51:03] <rawtaz> aah ok
[17:51:18] <rawtaz> i will probably jut keep using influx for now. can always switch later.
[17:51:43] <rawtaz> also not sure its worth bothering with grafana considering how good the new influx gui is, and that it has the telegraf agent provisioning.
[17:51:45] <Deknos> for at home i set up sometimes prometheus if i want to look at something
[17:51:51] <rawtaz> aha :)
[17:52:04] <rawtaz> i think prometheus is fine but it's not an option as it's lacking pull
[17:52:11] <rawtaz> if it had that, i'd use it
[17:52:13] <Deknos> the pretty thing is with docker at home i just shoot up prometheus and exporters, collect data, look at the problem and destroy it afterwards
[17:52:23] <rawtaz> nice :)
[17:52:34] <Deknos> yeah i know, at work we also had that attitude
[17:52:48] <Deknos> wait
[17:52:51] <gordonjcp> I guess I don't really know what's worth monitoring or not
[17:52:51] <Deknos> you meant push
[17:52:55] <Deknos> with prometheus?
[17:53:08] <Deknos> like, prometheus pulls
[17:53:14] <Deknos> but telegraf pushes
[17:53:18] <gordonjcp> backend response time, number of errors maybe
[17:53:20] <Deknos> and there are many who like the push more
[17:53:29] <rawtaz> Deknos: thats possible, lol. yeah. example use case is when you have stuff behind a NAT or just different networks and you dont want to poke holes in them. so yah, i mean push
[17:53:39] <rawtaz> Deknos: telegraf can do both ways :3
[17:53:42] <gordonjcp> actually general question for the channel
[17:53:42] <Deknos> but the prometheus guys say we pull you automatically have a "system is down" expection if pull's not possible
[17:53:53] <rawtaz> gordonjcp: basically disk space i guess thats the most important thing
[17:53:56] <Deknos> rawtaz, i know you can do that, but prometheus can do pull, bu tnot push
[17:54:11] <rawtaz> Deknos: yeah. prom can only do pull. telegraf can do both
[17:54:11] <Deknos> therefore i was confused as you said prometheus is lacking *pull*
[17:54:19] <rawtaz> yes, i am sorry. i totally miswrote that
[17:54:29] <rawtaz> i do offer banana as a reconciliation gift
[17:54:43] * rawtaz kneels
[17:54:46] <Deknos> all is good. i was just so confused, because i knew what you meant
[17:54:51] <rawtaz> :D
[17:54:53] <rawtaz> i bet
[17:54:53] <Deknos> and i had to reroll my whole thought process
[17:55:01] <Deknos> which i tend to do verbally
[17:55:10] <gordonjcp> rawtaz: I guess it depends what you're doing
[17:55:19] <rawtaz> yeah, i mean, that was a really close call - your entire last few working years could have turned out to be a lie, had i been right
[17:55:37] <Deknos> :D
[17:55:51] <gordonjcp> rawtaz: the main thing at the moment I want to monitor is a server running traefik, a mail server, and a Python web app consisting of an app server, a database server, a redis server and an nginx server for static content
[17:56:00] <gordonjcp> rawtaz: but it has infinite disk space
[17:56:08] <Deknos> gordonjcp, start with cpu, ram and diskspace, that always works and look for prometheus exporters for your $service
[17:56:13] <rawtaz> gordonjcp: really not much to monitor then haha
[17:56:21] <gordonjcp> rawtaz: that's what I figured
[17:56:23] <Deknos> postfix has an exporter :D
[17:56:46] <gordonjcp> rawtaz: probably activated versus not-activated signups
[17:56:59] <gordonjcp> rawtaz: any 40x or 50x errors
[17:57:14] <rawtaz> gordonjcp: i mean what you want to be alerted aobut is anomalies that might indicate a problem, such as a sudden ton of mail being sent or similar, could indicate a spam attack
[17:57:17] <rawtaz> but like, meh
[17:57:31] <gordonjcp> yeah that's basically it
[17:57:48] <gordonjcp> sudden massive automated signup attempts
[17:58:01] <rawtaz> if you have backups you want to monitor that they are run as they should
[17:58:38] *** Quits: foul_owl (~kerry@94.140.8.107) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[17:58:44] <rawtaz> and that of course means that you have a monitoring system that collects all the things you wnat to monitor, and then it sends you a mail or similar every X time, and you get used to that, and react if you dont get a mail in X time
[18:07:40] <gordonjcp> rawtaz: currently my up/down monitoring is someone who reads the forum obsessively and Whatsapps me if it stops working
[18:08:16] <gordonjcp> generally if the forum is down it indicates some unhappiness between postgres, the Python containers, and redis
[18:08:21] <rawtaz> i can relate to that :)
[18:08:23] <gordonjcp> and various other shit will be down

[18:35:04] <kwilczynski> The modern Internet tires me. Commercials everywhere. Dumb influencers everywhere. Armchair experts everywhere. Social media turned into self-promotion and virtue signalling. LinkedIn turned into another Facebook. And nothing works out of the box any more. Meh.
[18:35:09] <kwilczynski> Old people problems.
[18:42:57] <kwilczynski> Ahh. Nice. A DevOps team at one of the large shops chain with confectionery and such just bricked over 100 of their self-checkout POSes. Becaus nobody on the team knows how to admister Linux. LOL 
[18:47:27] <rawtaz> kwilczynski: got more info? can we read about it somewhere?
[18:47:39] <Deknos> not if your hydrogen atoms got more protons or neutrons.
[18:48:07] <Deknos> and wait a moment do you say hydrogen atoms have no halftime?
[18:48:26] <rawtaz> i bet its the armchair experts that really triggers kwilczynski agressions
[18:48:41] <Deknos> ubuntu linux works pretty good out of the box
[18:48:48] <Deknos> debian also.
[18:48:57] * rawtaz starts googling anger management courses for kwilczynski 
[18:49:12] <rawtaz> Deknos: yeah until it (ubuntu) breaks next time!
[18:49:58] <kwilczynski> rawtaz: No. I just got a call from a friend who works for Rossmann. :)
[18:50:11] <rawtaz> ok
[18:50:17] <kwilczynski> "Do I know how to untuck this maybe?"
[18:50:30] <kwilczynski> Sure I know! 200 EUR/hour :)
[18:50:33] <rawtaz> so what was the actual cause of the brick?
[18:50:37] <rawtaz> kwilczynski: yes! at least
[18:50:48] <kwilczynski> Of course they won't pay hehe
[18:50:50] <rawtaz> 200 is nothing in that situation for them :)
[18:52:09] <rawtaz> they want someone to fix it for them for free? well by all means, go ahead and keep looking
[18:52:11] <dodo> i'm sure they'll have a blameless post-mortem and learn from the event
[18:52:18] <rawtaz> if they want someone who has skills, it costs
[18:52:35] <Deknos> rawtaz, working out of the box and "never breaks" are different requirements
[18:53:09] <Deknos> and even debian breaks sometimes and they have a pretty good track record
[18:53:12] <kwilczynski> dodo: Haha
[18:53:39] <kwilczynski> rawtaz: The vendor quoted them some big lump sum for sending someone to fix it :)
[18:53:56] <kwilczynski> I am going to one of the stores to have a look.
[18:54:08] <dodo> and they went with.. hold my beer.. we'll do it ourselves?

[18:56:37] <kwilczynski> dodo: Yup
[18:56:46] <Deknos> anyone experience with opensuse? how do you like it?
[18:57:38] <kwilczynski> OpenSUSE and Thumbleweed are OK.
[18:57:55] <kwilczynski> Don't expect superbly up-to-date softwarez thought.
[18:58:21] <kwilczynski> (Even for Tumbleweed)
[18:58:35] <Deknos> tumbleweed is pretty up2date for me (i usually use debian :D) 
[18:58:36] <kwilczynski> God dammit Android autocorrect.
[18:58:47] <rawtaz> Deknos: im just dislike ubuntu. one of the main reasons is tha it's the one and single linux dist that breaks during updates for me, more than any other. i consider it shit, to be frank.
[18:58:56] <kwilczynski> Haha OK 
[18:59:07] <rawtaz> its not the only reason of course. but theres no other linux dist that has as much problems as ubuntu IMO
[18:59:33] <rawtaz> Deknos: i like opensuse :)
[18:59:38] <rawtaz> im not using it now though, i did before
[18:59:42] <rawtaz> suse in general i like
[19:00:08] <rawtaz> IME if you go with tumbleweed make sure to keep it updated frequently so there not too long between updates
[19:00:19] <kwilczynski> Ubuntu died with snapd

[20:56:13] <kwilczynski> The things people drive in Europe.
[20:56:14] <slaughter> Yeah there's some restrictions
[20:56:20] <kwilczynski> Might not qualify as cars sometimes.
[20:56:32] <slaughter> (spam incoming)
[20:56:36] <slaughter> - must have 4 doors and be able to transport a minimum of 4 passengers
[20:56:36] <slaughter> - must be 10 model years old or newer
[20:56:36] <slaughter> - title cannot be salvaged, reconstructed, or rebuilt.
[20:56:36] <slaughter> - rental vehicles are not allowed on the Uber platform.

[21:08:32] <kwilczynski> *.{c,h} in .gitignore
[21:08:36] <slaughter> Finding out they enabled and paid for LFS because some dev years ago was too stupid to realize they were checking in automatically generated logs and whatnot for some random thing
[21:08:37] <kwilczynski> Guaranteed memory safety.
[21:09:47] <rawtaz> slaughter: an old school trick is to put all your credentials that you put in the VCS in the .DS_Store files. that way the sensitive information is continously cleaned out by frustrated security ops people monitoring the repo.

[21:16:10] <kwilczynski> Who wants to install bitcoin miners on a POS? :)
[21:16:12] <Deknos> i thoguth 16.04 is out of support
[21:16:13] <kwilczynski> ;D
[21:16:13] <rawtaz> Deknos: ha! see that? water on my mill or what the saying is. ubuntu + upgrade => fail :-)
[21:16:20] <kwilczynski> Deknos: You are correct, sir.
[21:16:50] <kwilczynski> So someone did dist-upgrade on these.
[21:16:57] <kwilczynski> Which included kernel upgrade.
[21:16:59] <Deknos> rawtaz, i had never problems upgrading, i would assume you have done some black magic fuckery where ubuntu fails. and with other black magic fuckery other system upgrades for other distros will also fail
[21:17:13] <Deknos> oh wow
[21:17:17] <kwilczynski> And the vendor ships custom tarballs with pre-built kernel modules to support the hardware.
[21:17:22] <Deknos> ha
[21:17:27] <kwilczynski> So this one was first nice thing to do.
[21:17:33] <rawtaz> Deknos: i havent. i know linux enough to know how to properly upgrade it lol. its quite the opposite, i did some black magic to *fix* the fricken thing when it fscked up, so make the upgrade finish successfully.
[21:17:35] <Deknos> i would have bet on fucking custom kernel modules
[21:17:49] <kwilczynski> But then some helpful engineer decided that do-relase-upgrade is also a good idea.
[21:17:51] <Deknos> custom kernel modules were also a major PITA with LiMux back tehn
[21:17:53] <kwilczynski> Since 16.04 is ... old
[21:17:54] <kwilczynski> :)
[21:18:19] <kwilczynski> This is how, ladies and gentleman, we brick a POS which is an embedded device. :)
[21:18:31] <Deknos> that's one of the things i would advise every hardware vendor. get your fucking hardware in mainline
[21:18:44] <kwilczynski> Runs lxubuntu and has some kiosk mode MONO based application to deal with input and barcode scanner.
[21:18:44] <Deknos> and you will be painfree and your customers will love you
[21:18:45] <rawtaz> dont they have a way by which they can update the kernel and if the system doesnt come up after a while a watchdog reboots it and it starts the old kernel again?
[21:19:01] <kwilczynski> rawtaz: No. Nothing like that.
[21:19:15] <kwilczynski> The stop staff also didn't help the matter.
[21:19:30] <Deknos> i bet they do not have big enough /boot or sth like that so they cannot roll back their fucking custom stuff
[21:19:31] <kwilczynski> As they started to power cycle these repetitively. 
[21:19:42] <kwilczynski> In the end breaking filesystem on the NAND.

[21:24:01] <kwilczynski> I showed up.

[22:44:33] <rawtaz> question: is anyone here using crossplane or tried it?
[22:44:41] <rawtaz> im just curious what you think/thought of it
[22:44:46] <rawtaz> seems to be a competitor to terraform
[22:45:31] <rawtaz> haha, couple that with https://blog.crossplane.io/announcing-terrajet/ and terraform will die lol
[22:46:21] <rawtaz> (jk. it's a k8s thing)
[22:48:22] <slaughter> "You find Terraform complicated and annoying? You have too much to do already? Well we got you here, just use k8s! That simplifies everything! Right? Right?"
[22:48:39] <slaughter> I have decided to go fully hostile on k8s
[22:49:08] <rawtaz> LOL
