[00:00:02] <wwalker> Is there a simple way to get status, branch, and stash (boolean or a count)?  I love 'git status -sb', but I want this to work 'git status -sb --show-stash' or this 'git status -s --show-stash'

[05:37:25] <elibrokeit> nedbat: it's a reply to this comment of mine from quite a while back:
[05:37:26] <elibrokeit> [10:45:34 PM] <elibrokeit> quazimodo: the other problem with git-flow is that it assumes "sprinkle more branches on top" is the solution to all problems. It adds a lot of ritual ceremony that you generally don't need, and when you do need it, you don't need git-flow as a prerequisite (e.g. "branch a maintenance lineage off of the latest major release" is trivially done after the fact)
[05:38:38] <elibrokeit> git-flow has very particular branching "recommendations", when all you probably need is a) master, b) maint-$MAJOR.$MINOR
[05:39:37] <nedbat> elibrokeit: i was wondering in particular what steps were branded as ritual ceremony?

[05:50:42] <elibrokeit> well, you have a develop branch which is the git-flow version of traditional master branches. This is then branched into "release-MAJOR.MINOR" and then carefully merged --no-ff into "master", because merge commits are apparently next to godliness... that branch is atrociously named, it should be named "release". Then to seal the deal, you merge --no-ff back into develop too! Then delete release-MAJOR.MINOR
[05:50:42] <elibrokeit> Want to make a maintenance fix? Branch master this time, to hotfix-MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, then merge that back into master and then back into develop again. You can't branch off of release-MAJOR.MINOR because you deleted it lol

[06:44:51] <quazimodo> you make it sound worse than it is
[06:45:21] <quazimodo> in practice the biggest problems are not the thinking, the style or naming or even the ceremony but the effect it has on development professional practice & the business as a whole
[06:45:41] *** Quits: ChmEarl (~chmearl@user/chmearl) (Quit: Leaving)
[06:45:43] <quazimodo> devs tend to do longer, more complex features that are harder to 'get into prod ready state'
[06:45:52] <quazimodo> they often merge into `develop` stuff that is questionable
[06:46:27] <quazimodo> and frequently it gets hard to cut a release because `develop` is blocked by a feature that's not quite ready, or even more insidiously, is ready but marketing says don't release it yet
[06:47:18] <quazimodo> sensible cicd + excellent automated testing + trunk based dev + feature flags + elephant carpaccio is the way to go, i think

[23:07:12] <relipse> how do I clone a responsitory that is stored over ssh
[23:07:29] <relipse> is the idea of fork a git thing or is that only github and bitbucket?
[23:08:22] *** Quits: masber (~masber@vpn-74.cscs.ch) (Quit: Client closed)
[23:08:31] <j416> not a git thing
[23:08:31] <mackerman> fork workflow was invented by git hosting.  There is no fork operation native to git.
[23:08:54] <j416> a fork is just another repo as far as git is concerned
[23:08:55] <mackerman> Regarding  rm --cached,  you asked to  "unstage"  files.  This will leave them in the working directory.
[23:10:27] <j416> relipse: the * in public_html/_uploads/* is expanded by your shell, not git. If you want to remove that entire directory with contents, you can git rm -r --cached  public_html/_uploads
[23:10:42] <relipse> *update* yep -r worked fine thanks
[23:10:50] <j416> might be able to quote it like 'public_html/_uploads/*' too.

[23:12:56] <relipse> I have a server that I log in as relipse and then do sudo su to get to /home/foobar/myrepo/ , how do I clone that from my home computer
[23:13:55] <relipse> git clone relipse@remote.server.com:home/foobar/myrepo  ??
[23:13:57] <mackerman> A user that can log in with ssh, and has file permissions there.
[23:14:35] <relipse> so i'll need root
[23:14:43] <mackerman> No, not root
[23:15:21] <mackerman> You can grant user relipse  read and write to  ~foobar/myrepo
[23:15:42] <relipse> how do I do that mackerman
[23:15:56] <mackerman> Try asking a support channel of your operating system.
[23:16:55] <mackerman> File permissions aren't really a git thing.
[23:17:12] <mackerman> Would have the same problem if you wanted  sftp  access to upload and download files.

[23:22:14] <euouae> Hello
[23:22:23] <euouae> I'm confused about git workflows. Here's an example:
[23:23:03] <euouae> Suppose there's a function A() I want to modify. I make some changes, but it turns out that A() uses B() and B() is broken too. However, I don't want to make a gigantic PR with /too many/ changes, because it's hard to review.
[23:24:08] <euouae> so I make another branch, I fix B(), then I wish to continue working on A(), and I'd like to push two PRs, fix-B and fix-A. In github, this means I need the fix-A commented with "depends on #fix-B", for the sake of having some continuity -- helps reviewers.
[23:24:30] <euouae> My question is, after I have fixed B, do I merge A with it to continue working? Is that what I'm supposed to do?
[23:25:26] <mackerman> euouae: There are multple ways to do anything
[23:25:55] <mackerman> A  rebase of  fix-A to  the main branch might make sense after  fix-B is merged.
[23:26:17] <euouae> That's true mackerman, I guess, I'm struggling because the project has a "clean commits" soft-policy which I guess means the merges are ugly. But rebases are good?
[23:26:46] <euouae> Yeah unfortunately that means I have to wait for fix-B to be merged; I want to continue working on fix-A
[23:28:02] *** Quits: Krematorium (~Kremator@user/kremator) (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
[23:28:23] <mackerman> If you can prove fix-A fixes the problem at hand, you may not have to wait on fix-B.  Depends on your workflow, reviewers, and tests.

[23:28:46] <ZacSharp> If you are sure fix-B will be merged you can merge it for yourself locally and then rebase fix-A onto that

[23:29:20] <ZacSharp> as long as you and the upstream maintainer do the same thing the commits will end up being the same
[23:29:22] <euouae> ZacSharp ah! nice. Why should I merge it locally?
[23:29:38] <euouae> Hm... ok. to repeat the actions. Got it
[23:29:55] <ZacSharp> only problem might be authorship
[23:30:21] <ZacSharp> if the merge requires a signed commit you have no chance to do it or you discovered a severe security problem
[23:30:40] <relipse> do you need write permissions to clone a repo?
[23:30:49] <relipse> you'd think you only need read
[23:31:09] <euouae> ZacSharp, mackerman thanks for your help

[23:36:28] <euouae> although I sign my commits, this is an open-source project with no security requirements
[23:36:53] <ZacSharp> the problem is if the merge is a commit signed by someone else
[23:36:59] <lantech19446> / autojoinem.py add\n
[23:37:12] <euouae> I think the merges are done automatically by github that signs them right?
[23:37:15] <ZacSharp> but I just noticed you can just cherry-pick your commits onto theirs and are fine
[23:37:24] <ZacSharp> probably
[23:37:37] <ZacSharp> I think github singns its commits
[23:37:57] <euouae> github kind of gets in the way sometimes :( it's annoying
[23:38:03] <ZacSharp> but that just prevents creating the same commit
[23:38:30] <euouae> Another question I have is, how to maintain the order of branches?
[23:38:31] <ZacSharp> you can still merge locally, work on that merge and the cherry-pick/repase/whatever the files onto the actual merge

[23:48:49] <euouae> This project I work on uses master instead of main
[23:49:01] <euouae> I think it's too much work for the devs to change it right now
[23:49:08] <ikke> That was and still is the default for git
[23:50:51] <euouae> I have another project that I work on myself where I made two mistakes
[23:51:03] <euouae> 1) I didn'g sign the commits and 2) I forgot to include a license until after
[23:51:18] <euouae> how can I reapply everything, and reorder the license to be commit #1? With rebase, right?
[23:51:31] <euouae> (reapply everything so that it's signed)
[23:51:51] <mackerman> You don't need for a license to be the first commit
[23:52:22] <euouae> I've been told that's the case mackerman , not legal advice but general advice on a gpl channel
[23:53:09] <ikke> but in general, rebase can be used for these kinds of things, yes

[23:54:51] <nedbat> euouae: if someone says the license has to be first, they will also say that rebasing to make it first doesn't count.
[23:55:09] <nedbat> euouae: the point is, if someone grabbed your code now, there's no license.  You can't actually go back in time to fix that.
