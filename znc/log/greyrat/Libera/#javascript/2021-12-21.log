[00:37:48] <faLUKE> Hello. I'm trying to panzoom a PDF document. I wrote a little snippet for this, by using two libs: PDF.js and the panzoom lib. But I'm stuck into two issues. Any GURU can fix them?  Here is the description of the problem:  https://github.com/timmywil/panzoom/issues/599   and my attempt:  https://jsfiddle.net/s36vetug/8/
[00:39:39] <jr_web_dev> so i have to create a drag and drop feature with images.. i basically just need a simple setup to get me going.  I guess i would just need a background/canvas where i can drag and drop anywhere.. pixel by pixel.. all the online tutorials i see have drag and drop examples where theres a predefined area.. and if you drop in that area.. it just statically applies the image.. for me, i need a drag
[00:39:40] <jr_web_dev> and drop by the pixel.. i see it and when i let it go it stays exactly there.  I did this in React but i want to use Python as my backend this time and perhaps just use pure javascript or jquery.. whatever may be best that targets most web browsers these days

[03:38:39] <faLUKE> hassoon: here's an example.   https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70428922/pan-zoom-a-pdf-javascript   <... It's a question I wrote some hours ago
[03:38:52] <faLUKE> and I don't know how to solve it
[03:39:37] <df00z> Hey, I can't find any answer to this - if you are importing local dependencies - how do you prevent them from being included more than once?   C++\C you use headers + fndef.   I literally cannot find the answer on the internet.   I see references to node.js or using packagers, but modules is native JS functionality.
[03:39:46] <hassoon> faLUKE: render an svg instead of an img
[03:39:58] <faLUKE> hassoon: ?
[03:40:24] <df00z> It's gonna be blurry if you are just zooming a canvas
[03:40:31] <df00z> You'd need to re-render the PDF
[03:40:37] <faLUKE> df00z: yes, that's what I wrotew
[03:40:42] <df00z> canvas is raster data
[03:40:44] <faLUKE> the problem is that I dunno how
[03:40:52] <faLUKE> df00z: I know, I know
[03:40:58] <faLUKE> read better the question
[03:41:47] <faLUKE> I also provided a fiddle with the render function.
[03:42:00] <hassoon> pdf to html is the way bro
[03:42:05] <df00z> Looks like there's something in the code called PageViewport .  You'd have to like google TBH.  I have not used pdf.js.
[03:42:11] <df00z> PageViewport takes scale tho
[03:42:19] <faLUKE> df00z: I googled a lot

[03:43:56] <faLUKE> df00z: there's already a render function in my snippet
[03:44:42] <df00z> panzoom wont work, you needa touch "page.getViewport({ scale: 1, });" probably in your code
[03:44:58] <faLUKE> df00z: that's what I tried to do
[03:45:11] <faLUKE> read better. there's a commented line

[03:52:29] <df00z> It looks like it's an actual pain in the butt.  You need to create a new canvas each time you scale, use a promise, and either copy the contents into the canvas in the DOM or replace the DOM canvas
[03:52:38] <df00z> I am not going to write all the code to do that but that will work
[03:53:08] <df00z> Something like renderPage(container.getBoundingClientRect().height * scale); is correct
[03:53:28] <faLUKE> df00z: that's what I wrote
[03:53:46] <df00z> Yeah, you need to write the code to create a canvas, and, on promise, update the DOM
[03:53:51] <df00z> s  vanvas with the 2d api
[03:54:00] <df00z> It's not a copy\paste job
[03:54:22] <df00z> It'll bark if you try to reuse the canvas, tells you you cant
[03:54:50] <faLUKE> df00z: that could be a good idea (avoid to reuse the canvas)
[03:55:08] <faLUKE> df00z: I don't understand why I can't though
[03:55:09] <df00z> Looks like it's required.  If you don't it works for like two seconds and crashes.

[03:55:59] <faLUKE> df00z: so, at each render I have to create a new canvas and embed it into the div?

[03:56:22] <df00z> You can do that, or use 2d API and copy stuff from the canvas you created to the OG canvas after clearing the OG canvas with like a white color

[03:56:57] <df00z> I imagine graphically copying the contents of the canvas is going to work much better

[03:57:50] <df00z> Looks like it's also OK to wait.
[03:57:55] <faLUKE> df00z: but  think this can be solved by queueing the renderings
[03:58:00] <df00z> Sure.
[03:58:18] <faLUKE> df00z: if I move slowly the wheel, this problem doesn't appear
[03:58:22] <df00z> Set a flag before the promise, or check if the promise is resolved, unset the flag after, check the flag before doing it
[03:58:23] <df00z> yup.
[03:58:25] <faLUKE> it's not the main problem
[03:58:36] <df00z> You need sort of like a mutex

[04:04:28] <hassoon> interesting, postMessage works cross domain
[04:05:36] <df00z> It's not centered because the code is gonna render it from the upper left.  If you wanted to center it you're gonna have to to 2d operations on the created canvas and center the image in the DOM's canvas.
[04:06:03] <df00z> basically adding width / 2 and height / 2

[19:33:42] <ljharb> Feuermagier: you split on the dot, and parseInt each part
[19:33:42] <maret> btw the code above is missing new before Promise
[19:34:03] <ljharb> onosendi i mean it’s not really fine, circular deps are always bad

[19:34:35] <jellobot> (okay) 33355572187707336
[19:34:39] <stenno> that wont work
[19:34:55] <ljharb> onosendi: that said, i think the import plugin should already not warn on circular types, or may have an option for it. Look for an existing issue, or file it?

[19:35:11] <jellobot> (okay) '0.9'

[19:35:28] <stenno> see?
[19:35:43] <ljharb> stenno: hm, then yeah there’s probably some algorithm to do it, but decimal numbers in base 36 is bizarre so i don’t know what it is
[19:36:00] <ljharb> Feuermagier: why are you stringifying decimal numbers in base “not 10” in the first place?
[19:36:01] <maret> sorry er response.data is undefined

[19:38:29] <Feuermagier> ljharb, yes. I can predict the next output given enough previous ones.
[19:38:32] <ljharb> Feuermagier: and why is the server doing that?
[19:38:58] <ljharb> Feuermagier: are you sure? What if the server restarts during that process, or what if v8 changes its random seed periodically?
[19:39:15] <Feuermagier> ljharb, they use the mentioned method to generate password resets they mail to the user
[19:39:54] <Feuermagier> ljharb, this is for a CTF challange - I have the serverside code here. Goal is to predict the next password that gets generated if you reset the password for any given user.

[22:54:46] <twiclo> Line 2 returns an error from Google Maps stating initMap doesn't exist so I've got an async issue here. I'm just not sure about what the best way to fix this would be
[22:55:02] <twiclo> This was working when this code was being ran in electron but I'm working on loading it in a browser and now there's a problem with this line
[22:56:02] <EdFletcher> twiclo: where is `initMap()` called?
