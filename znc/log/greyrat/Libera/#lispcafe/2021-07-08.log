[08:52:20] -ixelp- HiFive Unmatched - SiFive
[08:53:43] <aeth> A bit large for what it is (I zoomed the image in until it roughly matched dimensions)
[08:54:03] <GreaseMonkey> it's an ITX motherboard
[08:54:26] <aeth> which is massive for a non-standard, weak computer
[08:54:29] <aeth> compare to a pi
[08:54:35] <GreaseMonkey> but you *can* shove a GPU into it
[08:54:47] <aeth> a pi is really compact
[08:54:51] <GreaseMonkey> if you get one, you're going to want to somehow replace the CPU fan because of how obscenely loud it is
[08:55:09] <aeth> Another comparison, the x86-64 Udoo Bolt (Ryzen Embedded)... https://www.udoo.org/docs-bolt/Introduction/Introduction.html
[08:55:10] -ixelp- Introduction - UDOO BOLT Docs
[08:55:31] <aeth> 12 cm vs 17 cm
[08:56:29] <aeth> meanwhile the pi is tiny since it's basically a phone without a screen/battery, but with USB/etc.
[08:56:43] <GreaseMonkey> in practice the Udoo Bolt is going to be more practical
[08:58:11] <GreaseMonkey> oh lol it actually has an AVR on the board
[08:58:19] <GreaseMonkey> (the bolt, that is)
[08:58:27] <aeth> the pi is 5.6 cm x 8.5 cm according to page 4 of https://datasheets.raspberrypi.org/rpi4/raspberry-pi-4-product-brief.pdf
[08:59:08] <GreaseMonkey> i think the unmatched aimed to have an ITX mobo primarily so you could put the thing into a standard desktop case
[08:59:14] <aeth> (that's the pi 4, anyway. I have the pi 3, but I can't imagine the dimensions changed much)
[08:59:38] <aeth> GreaseMonkey: yeah, but
[08:59:50] <aeth> GreaseMonkey: it's not really a standard desktop so it's a mismatch
[08:59:58] <aeth> and mini-ITX cases are massive
[09:00:07] <GreaseMonkey> you could even say it's...
[09:00:09] <GreaseMonkey> ...inapproprate
[09:00:43] <GreaseMonkey> and i just had to typo that
[09:00:45] <aeth> most popular mini-ITX cases will be designed to house a full-size GPU (and they just keep getting larger) since most people game with PCs they build
[09:00:47] <GreaseMonkey> thanks, hands
[09:01:38] <aeth> esoteric systems should be designed for the form factor where you just keep collecting them and end up with a Beowulf cluster eventually
[09:02:44] <aeth> every cluster needs to mix ARM64, RISCV 64, and x86-64, btw
[09:03:29] <aeth> gotta have a random shelf of random small computers
[09:05:21] <aeth> doesn't make sense that the beta-quality RISC V would be the largest, though
[09:13:07] <hayley> Makes sense to me, as you aren't going to do a lot of miniaturization when you haven't got a finished product.
[09:17:06] <GreaseMonkey> it's somewhat unstable and the USB loves to randomly disconnect stuff
[09:17:31] <aeth> hayley: makes sense for them, not for me
[09:17:53] <aeth> what am I going to do with it when I upgrade
[09:18:10] <aeth> meanwhile I could probably just have a stack of 10 generations of raspberry pis before I start caring
[09:19:33] <aeth> power consumption, too
[09:20:27] <aeth> desktop case means desktop power supply... mini-ITX usually are about 500W but more than half of that is the GPU
[09:21:25] <aeth> spec sheet just says "ATX Power Supply (Not included)"
[09:21:50] <aeth> I like the M.2, though
[09:22:52] <hayley> IIRC there are smaller RISC-V doohickeys though.
[09:23:37] <hayley> https://beagleboard.org/beaglev e.g. this one
[09:23:38] -ixelp- BeagleBoard.org - BeagleV
[09:23:44] <aeth> looks like the full data sheet says 150W fully loaded not counting a PCIe with an external power source if I'm parsing that correctly. https://sifive.cdn.prismic.io/sifive/d0556df9-55c6-47a8-b0f2-4b1521546543_hifive-unmatched-datasheet.pdf
[09:24:31] <aeth> might be a challenge finding a high-quality 150W power supply
[09:24:58] <hayley> Though that board is only available for pre-order if you can port Linux and a bootloader basically.
[09:25:25] <aeth> hayley: that's more of the form factor I'd expect from this sort of thing, but I wonder if it's the full RISC V experience. So much is optional. Not just say 32 bit vs 64 bit, but also e.g. floats
[09:25:33] <hayley> RISC-V had a program for compiler writers (wink wink) but I think it's to encourage you to join their bullshit foundation.
[09:25:53] <hayley> aeth: No, I believe that's all RV64GC, which includes single and double floats and atomics.
[09:26:20] <aeth> boo

[09:28:29] <hayley> Funny there is no Vector extension when I swear every other RISC-V AI thing had it.
[09:29:28] <aeth> as someone with math experience I could easily find some simple Project Euler style exercises that would use up quadruple- or octuple-precision floats if the hardware had them available
[09:29:30] <hayley> FWIW Sipeed let you SSH into their new RISC-V board for a while, so of course I compiled ECL on it. Sadly SBCL would run out of heap while building Unicode tables or something.

[09:30:38] <aeth> 1 GB seems plenty for headless
[09:30:40] <aeth> 1 GB is not
[09:30:54] <aeth> just between SBCL and Emacs you're probably eating up 300 MB in practice
[09:31:01] <hayley> Someone else was running rustc on the same machine, so I had pkill ready in case I needed to start a cold war to build SBCL.
[09:32:30] <cond> All of the RAM in the world must be sacrificed for me. I love RAM. Can't get enough of it.
[09:32:56] <hayley> The machine was supposed to be cheaper but they got done over by the chip shortage and it's US$99 rather than like $10 as initially stated.
[09:33:07] <aeth> lol
[09:33:29] <aeth> that chip shortage has been brutal
[09:33:41] <aeth> even as far back as 2020 it delayed my VR headset by like 3-4 months

[14:19:17] <pjb> hayley: what implementation?
[14:19:20] <hayley> The library does not appear to actually have a copy of the GC Handbook.
[14:19:27] <hayley> pjb: SBCL. IIRC its READ does normalization.
[14:19:42] <pjb> Not a good move‚Ä¶
[14:20:09] <pjb> Does it implement character attributes? char-int?
[14:20:41] <hayley> I don't know.

[14:24:08] <sham1> Well looking at SBCL's READ impl. it seems to internally use character attributes, but I don't really see if it's actually normalizing character sequences in any way

[15:46:41] <shka> hmmm
[15:46:53] <shka> so i am programming web api in CL currently
[15:47:02] <shka> and i am not doing web apis very often
[15:47:23] <hayley> Though I am up to 2,600 words in my next article. How long were my previous ones?
[15:47:32] <shka> but this makes me wonder why restarts didn't became more mainstream
[15:47:40] <treflip> I'm writing a X11 window manager in CL :)
[15:47:50] <shka> they are so useful in this context

[15:52:30] <hayley> I think this was the first r/lispmemes worthy Lisp meme I made
[15:56:25] <selwyn> shka: do you provide restarts in a 404 error page or sth
[15:56:56] <shka> selwyn: no, but i have api that parses file
[15:57:11] <shka> and this includes: what happens when file was already parsed?
[15:57:31] <shka> what happens when there is non fatal error (for instance some thread is left alive)
[15:58:27] <shka> and i want to use this system from both REPL and via the web API

[19:49:16] <shka> i like arch because packages are fresh and not tinkered with on the downstream

[19:53:21] <sham1> Emacs doesn't have one either. Well, unless you talk about "window management" in terms of how in Emacs what are usually called panes or splits are called windows
[19:53:25] <shka> that is kinda cool
[19:53:32] <sham1> As for EXWM, that's not built in either
[19:54:07] <clothespin> no, i saw on some video that there was a WM for emacs, I don't know if it used gnome as a crutch or what

[19:57:02] <selwyn> ¬®it is np-hard only in theory, no need to worry¬®
[19:58:27] <shka> well, does rust has macros?
[19:59:00] <MichaelRaskin> I wouldn't say so much ¬´only on pathological examples¬ª, but computations running on the type system are possible and should be quite noticeable
[19:59:13] <sham1> shka: Yes, in fact. Hygenic at that
[19:59:23] <sham1> hygienic even
[19:59:25] <shka> heh
[19:59:48] <MichaelRaskin> Rust mostly has procedural macros, but refuses to standardise some of the critical support things for them yet, but there are crates‚Ä¶
[20:00:02] <shka> macros can be used to generate truly weird code
[20:00:45] <MichaelRaskin> I don't believe you can _accidentally_ produce a computation-on-type-system with macros
[20:00:57] <MichaelRaskin> Sure, they might help you produce that deliberately

[23:35:24] <shka> gilberth: hi
[23:35:35] <shka> gilberth: ravenpack answered for my application
[23:35:58] <gilberth> For a job?
[23:36:01] <shka> yup
[23:36:14] <shka> but now this job is "flexible remote"
[23:36:17] <shka> which sucks
[23:36:22] <shka> eh
[23:36:42] <gilberth> Hmm, why? "flexible remote" sound good.
[23:37:21] <shka> because this means that i will still have to visit the office which is in NY, London, or Spain
[23:38:24] <gilberth> Oh dear. Long commute, or will you move?
[23:38:34] <shka> not worth it
[23:38:50] <shka> NY and London are hilariously expensive, i don't speak Spanish
[23:39:17] <shka> and long distance away from the family
[23:39:50] <gilberth> Hmm, so you decline?
[23:40:37] <shka> i will test the flexibility of the remote 
[23:40:51] <shka> if it bends all the way into remote, then cool
[23:41:12] <shka> but if not, well, this won't work for me
[23:41:22] <shka> besides i do horrible in reviews anyway
[23:41:33] <shka> my personality... is not the best
[23:43:54] <gilberth> How so? What is wrong with your personality? And traveling at these times doesn't sound like a good idea.
[23:44:20] <shka> heh, i wish i knew, but i think that i am repulsive somehow
[23:46:29] * gilberth needs more coffee.
[23:49:40] <selwyn> they have london offices?
[23:49:50] <shka> yeah, apparently 
[23:50:20] <selwyn> wow
[23:50:36] <shka> so prestige?
[23:51:24] <selwyn> well, i live in london so i could do it without going to spain
[23:51:37] <selwyn> i also thought they would not ever diversify from spain
[23:51:51] <selwyn> i would not apply for like 6 months at least though
[23:52:47] <selwyn> london is not that special for tech anyway i would say, maybe finance is the pull for them
[23:53:53] <shka> yeah, also not being part of the EU anymore is not the ideal situation from the business perspective
[23:55:37] <selwyn> i got my patriotic brexit passport yesterday
[23:56:19] <shka> you should start use "brexit" as Americans use "freedom"
[23:56:33] <selwyn> there are already a few jokes like this
[23:56:43] <shka> they love to slap "freedom" on everything
[23:57:01] <shka> like "Space Station Freedom"
[23:57:15] <shka> which eventually turned into ISS
[23:57:47] <selwyn> well, there is a ¬¥brexit festival¬¥ due to be held next year
[23:58:40] <selwyn> no-one knows yet what will be in it
[23:59:22] <shka> yeah, it is great, right?
[23:59:45] <selwyn> i try to enjoy the incompetence
