[13:37:44] <AadVersteden[m]> What is the recommended way for being able to hide certain items from the backlinks buffer?  I have a large list of meeting documents which are very interesting in some contexts, but clutter in other contexts.  I'd like to filter them from the backlinks buffer in some cases.
[13:39:15] <AadVersteden[m]> I really love how typical of a user request this is.  "I really really want this one thing and I want it to be always like the way I want it to be but I'm woefully under-constraining the problem."  Rest assured, I know I still have to figure out manual toggles on what I need as I gain more experience with it :-)
[13:39:27] <konubini`> AadVersteden[m]: You mean like an agenda filter?

[13:41:14] <AadVersteden[m]> konubini`: The agenda is sensible now.  I'm eying the org-roam buffer and org-roam-node-find right now.

[13:54:31] <AadVersteden[m]> Actually, I'm really really happy with how the agenda works right now.  It seems to work well for a bunch of tasks.
