[03:04:27] <oramirite> Namarrgon: I figure out the crash in Gnome. Long story short, I accidentally picked one of their Virtual Production project file templates, which includes some more complicated engine plugins that crashed on Linux. This doesn't surprise me as I'm familiar with those plugins and don't expect them to work on Linux. Picking one of their basic project file templates works, and I am fully in the editor now on gnome :)

[05:27:17] <thrice> if you want to install new packages, it's assumed that you are running an up to date system
[05:27:44] <chipps__> if the new program depends on newer versions of some programs, ideally pacman should update _exactly_ which programs are required by the new program

[06:14:14] <Ghosthree3> kyojo: thats fine, i dont see many pkgbuilds that validate by signature anyway tbh, use sha512sum or something?
[06:14:24] <kyojo> sorry not signature, sha256sum
[06:14:32] <kyojo> that's what the original PKGBUILD uses
[06:14:43] <kyojo> seems the maintainer just summed it locally though
[06:14:45] <blinux> I think he needs a way to overide the key check. Otherwise you could do build from source yourself from the upstream location. You could even look in the make package if the instructions are sparce in the upstream.
[06:14:48] <Ghosthree3> well, unless they provide a hash or something there's not much you can do except hash it yourself...? tampering is unlikely, especially over tls

[06:19:16] <kevr> blinux: uhh, what
[06:19:22] <kevr> "crypto keys for all TLS?"
[06:19:33] <blinux> You would have to do that the application level above the TLS layer. I think that would work. I only partially think I understand.
[06:20:04] <kyojo> kevr: the upstream source really doesnt like linux users, the most likely response from them is 'gfys'
[06:20:18] <kevr> MITM requires that you intercept the packet, the packet is encoded with a private key that nobody has, math says unless somebody proves it wrong, the chance is highly unlikely that somebody has that.
[06:20:24] <blinux> I'm saying I heard somebody built a vulnerability into the whole TLS system. So, if that is true you would have to have a layer above that, like at the application layer on top of TLS, like end to end encryption at the application layer to deal with that.
[06:20:26] <kevr> maybe for a few servers

[07:26:46] <thurstylark> So, I've got a libvirt guest that I have set up to share a dir from the host using these instructions: https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Libvirt#9p The share works, and the guest can see what it needs to, but I'm having trouble with symlinks. On the host I have a symlink whose target is in the same directory, and it uses a relative path. On the guest, that symlink still exists, but it now has a
[07:26:47] <phrik> Title: libvirt - ArchWiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)

[09:01:26] <Ghosthree3> rcf: and yes it is about that, basically ive realized an unintended flaw of copying back in the active kernel could cause initramfs builder hooks to attempt to build an image for it (however i think this particular hook just sucks, it fires on every kernel present in /lib/modules whether it was _just_ updated or not)

[12:19:20] <weltio> what is a proper way to use uefi boot with removable devices? from my understanding there would be the need to adapt the nvram on each system that needs to boot the removable device, am i correct? with mbr one could just say "boot the disk" and everhting was read from the removable device
[12:20:04] <grawity> the specification says that the firmware should search for *any* partition compatible with the EFI File System (i.e. FAT) and look for a loader file named \EFI\BOOT\BOOTX64.EFI in it

[12:20:30] <grawity> in fact most firmwares do this even for *internal* disks, if no NVRAM entries work
[12:20:45] <SysGhost> weltio: UEFI have a "fall back" boot method where it looks at a default path to load up a payload. That one do not need any entry in the nvram area.
[12:20:45] <weltio> ah so it should work ootb
[12:22:25] <SysGhost> that's the idea when a system has nothing configured. It looks at that default path when everything else fails, or if the user has specified a device to boot on (when one select a device in a boot menu presented by the UEFI)
[12:23:53] <SysGhost> grub for instance uses this default path when it "installs" with the --removable option set.
[12:24:15] <grawity> this usually allows you to just move the internal rootfs disk from one motherboard to another, and have it boot
[12:24:28] <weltio> thanks
[12:24:35] <grawity> (and e.g. Windows has self-healing that'll automatically add missing NVRAM entries once booted)

[16:25:40] <daniel2702> Hi, after updating and rebooting today i found pacman stopped working. It always says "Bus error". I found this: https://archived.forum.manjaro.org/t/pacman-broken-after-update-bus-error/25887/4 and would like to try that, but I cannot boot from usb. So is there anybody having an idea how I could solve this from within the running system?

[16:25:43] <Edu4rd> Namarrgon, thanks for clarifying, have a great day!
[16:26:00] <nl6720> if you place fs drivers in the ESP, systemd-boot will load them
[16:26:03] <Edu4rd> daniel2702, you should ask to manjaro support for it.
[16:26:07] <TheDcoder> nl6720: It supports all FS supported by the firmware, is that right?
[16:26:13] <Namarrgon> TheDcoder: this doesn't apply to grub; it comes with its own drivers and doesn't care about XBOOTLDR either
[16:26:14] <Edu4rd> If you're using manjaro.
[16:26:16] <daniel2702> I'm not running manjaro

[17:59:56] <kulak> the reason I find sgdisk useful, because I can write down the command used instead of describing in my words what I did.  I also recommend technique used in the begining of OpenZFS guide.  That's to make life easier:  when booting from ISO and installing system I issue passwd, set root passwd, then start sshd with `systemctl start sshd` then check my `ip addr` and continue with installation from another computer using ssh client session.

[20:47:50] <Itaru> I'm trying to set up PAM to require a U2F Key, Fingerprint and Password in order to authenticate as root. Currently, it treats it as an 'OR' instead of an 'AND', and any one of the three authentication types is accepted without needing the other two. How could I fix this?

[20:52:30] <NetSysFire> i have exactly the setup you want tlol
[20:52:32] <NetSysFire> hang on
[20:53:46] <NetSysFire> https://bpa.st/NAMA i have that in my /etc/pam.d/sudo, so it first tries u2f and if that works it skips everything else, if not it tries fingerprint, if not a password is required

[22:32:13] <BrainDamage> manually setting ips does work, and googling ACD is some sort of mechanism to prevent address duplication, but it's attempted on a arp-less network, which would naturally fail, not sure if it's the fatal cause or not

[22:50:43] <srg> Hey all. I have several AUR git clones sitting around. I periodically check each one for updates manually.... Is there a tool/script to automatically check all of them for updates? Or should I just write a script to do it?

[22:52:34] <grawity> pretty much why people use AUR helpers
[22:52:55] <grawity> though I scripted my own tool for git repos *in general*
[22:53:00] <jonathon> yup. could also use something like nvchecker to keep an eye on the upstream rather than the aur package

[22:54:19] <grawity> but basically started with `for dir in */; do git -C "$dir" pull --ff-only; done`
[22:55:05] <Earnestly> I hope other appreciate how smart that usage is
[22:55:08] <Earnestly> others*
[22:58:21] <grawity> I was thinking yesterday, what I find neat/weird about bash is that you can alias, like, half a compound command and it'll work – e.g. alias foreach="while IFS= read -r" and then `foo | foreach line; do ... done`
[22:58:50] <jonathon> that's basically function currying. that's nice.
[22:58:59] <Earnestly> It helps to think of aliases as C macros, straight textual replacement
