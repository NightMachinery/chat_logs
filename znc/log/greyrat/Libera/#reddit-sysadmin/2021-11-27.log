[06:49:33] <Hunterkll> @pyathalon you know, micron SSDs come with a spacer just for that uprpose

[06:50:08] <Hunterkll> like that
[06:50:32] <sd> 12<p‚Äãyathalon> Oh to have a spacer right now. I grabbed this from another machine so no such box
[06:51:08] <sd> 15<L‚Äãoudergood> I've used folder paper in the past. Worked for years.
[06:52:43] <sd> 12<p‚Äãyathalon> I innitially thought I was having driver issues, then I noticed it didn't turn up in bios either. Turns out it lets you insert it incorrectly lol. The hdd that was in there didn't have any spacers at all lol
[06:53:52] <Hunterkll> usually if you have screw holes it'll let you screw it in at the right height without spacers
[06:53:53] <Hunterkll> lol
[06:54:01] <Hunterkll> but that requires actually screwing it in
[06:54:39] <sd> 12<p‚Äãyathalon> oh neat when did we get a bot that supports s//
[06:55:51] <Hunterkll> years and years ago
[06:55:55] <Hunterkll> but it only works for IRC
[06:55:56] <Hunterkll> :)
[06:56:02] <sd> 12<p‚Äãyathalon> @Hunterkill Yea I would have screwed it in, but it doesn't even have screw holes lol just dimples, if you can see in the picture. Though I guess I could just drill some
[06:56:31] <Hunterkll> ha
[06:56:33] <Hunterkll> that's silly
[06:56:40] <Hunterkll> i'd just buy some of the spacers to have on hand at that point
[06:58:13] <sd> 12<p‚Äãyathalon> Works on discord now too
[06:58:42] <Hunterkll> then it's some kind of different bot
[06:58:44] <Hunterkll> not the same one
[06:58:53] <Hunterkll> bloody must be getting bored trying to recreate irc in discord
[06:59:23] <sd> 12<p‚Äãyathalon> Didn't even know it was possible in discord, I guess the bot deletes and reposts the comment as itself
[06:59:41] <Hunterkll> that or it's discord itself
[06:59:47] <Hunterkll> because i didn't see your s/ or anything else
[06:59:53] <Hunterkll> which means it never came into the discord server

[09:05:47] <Telgareith> bad hdd
[09:05:56] <Telgareith> hit it a few times with a screw driver and it booted
[09:06:21] <Hunterkll> oh yea 
[09:06:25] <Telgareith> juicy juicy teenage girl angst y diary was included. 
[09:06:27] <Hunterkll> i've found some amazing shit
[09:06:41] <Hunterkll> like a nonprofit's accounting and tax paperwork that was relatively current on a macbook (2nd gen intel)
[09:06:49] <Telgareith> I proceeded to use OS9 as a bootloader for linux
[09:07:07] <Hunterkll> bah there were better ways
[09:07:13] <Telgareith> not on that machine
[09:07:16] <Telgareith> maybe it was os8
[09:07:40] <Hunterkll> m68k or powerpc?
[09:07:44] <Telgareith> ppc
[09:07:48] <Telgareith> performa 6400
[09:08:12] <Hunterkll> yea that shoulda been "relatively" easy
[09:08:49] <Telgareith> it wasn't just a matter of booting yellow dog linux and installing it
[09:09:59] <Hunterkll> i mean depending on how long ago it was but
[09:10:33] <Hunterkll> quik would have handled it just fine without needing full maccos stuff
[09:10:39] <Telgareith> 2003?
[09:10:58] <Hunterkll> yea quik woulda done the job 
[09:11:26] <Hunterkll> designed for kernel 2.2, preferred to use ext2 for stability/reliability reasons, etc
[09:12:02] <Hunterkll> someone's actually maintained it for modern kernels on old world machines, named 'iQUIK'
[09:12:38] <Hunterkll> using a tiny macOS partition was the easiest route, however

[09:13:23] <Hunterkll> page about the tools from 2004, at any rate
[09:14:55] <Hunterkll> BootX used QUIK code but had to run from within OS 8 or OS 9 
[09:15:48] <Hunterkll> BootX you'd need for macs without open firmware
[09:15:49] <Hunterkll> iirc
[09:16:18] <Hunterkll> NetBSD also supported native boot
[09:20:42] <Telgareith> idk
[09:20:44] <Telgareith> I was a kid
[09:20:49] <Telgareith> the machine was garbage
[09:21:08] <Telgareith> running fluxbox used half the ram
[09:21:14] <Hunterkll> lol that's not such a bad machine
[09:21:47] <Hunterkll> what did it have like 4 or 8MB or something
[09:21:47] <Hunterkll> lol
[09:22:11] <Telgareith> idk it was low enough I compiled a custom kernel to get more ram
[09:22:34] <Telgareith> and it took a day to compile
[09:23:28] <Hunterkll> yesh, I was loving life with fluxbox in 32MB ram with browsers and all sorts of shit running 
[09:24:02] <Telgareith> idk I think my laptop at the time had 64meg
[09:24:24] <Hunterkll> ow
[09:24:34] <Hunterkll> we added an extra 512mb to my ibook around then so i could play medal of honor better

[09:26:07] <Hunterkll> my other shit spanked it
[09:26:15] <Telgareith> then it was earlier
[09:26:21] <Telgareith> because P4's weren't out yet
[09:26:39] <Hunterkll> P4s came out in late 2000 
[09:26:58] <Telgareith> then maybe I just couldn't afford them
[09:26:58] <Hunterkll> Performa 6400 was brand new late 1997 
[09:27:09] <Telgareith> ok so maybe 2000
[09:27:28] <Telgareith> I might still have my install CDs somewhere
[09:27:31] <Telgareith> *checks*
[09:27:38] <Hunterkll> even a 3 year old 6400 wouldn't be tossed unless it was some rich person's home machine, stock 16mb ram, had specialized busses/slots for video editing gear, etc

[09:33:16] <Hunterkll> eh
[09:33:17] <Hunterkll> lol
[09:33:51] <Telgareith> the pools only alive because I had a hot spare

[09:34:03] <Hunterkll> The drive found 24 bad sectors during its self test.
[09:34:03] <Hunterkll> There are 24 weak sectors found on the disk surface. They may be remapped any time in the later use of the disk.
[09:34:09] <Hunterkll> drive's had 13,123 bad sectors for 3-4 months now
[09:34:11] <Hunterkll> it'll be fine

[09:35:28] <Telgareith> well one of those two is showing as a red light on the bay
[09:35:38] <Telgareith> so its dead dead
[09:35:41] <Hunterkll> I got 64GB SSDs with over 40TBW 
[09:35:42] <Hunterkll> lol
[09:36:00] <Telgareith> never owned a 64gb ssd
[09:36:07] <Telgareith> splurged and got a 128gb vertex 3
[09:36:16] <Telgareith> never did get bit by the BSOD bug
[09:36:29] <Telgareith> its around here somewhere...
[09:36:34] <Hunterkll> lol
[09:36:41] <Hunterkll> yea i just use random shit i have laying around in my storage
[09:36:53] <Telgareith> its a USB3 portable drive now
[09:37:08] <Telgareith> faster and more reliable than USB sticks...
[09:37:11] <Hunterkll> a few of my 64GB SSDs are in mSATA -> SATA 2.5" adapter things
[09:37:39] <Telgareith> I forget what mSATA is
[09:37:53] <Hunterkll> mini sata, like m.2 slot formfactor but before it was a thing
[09:38:01] <Telgareith> oh
[09:38:02] <Hunterkll> my PowerBook G4 has a 128GB in an mSATA -> Laptop IDE adapter
[09:38:03] <Telgareith> never had one
[09:38:19] <Hunterkll> you probably did without realizing it
[09:38:25] <Telgareith> totally did not
[09:38:43] <Hunterkll> mSATA was EVERYWHERE before M.2 standardized 
[09:39:17] <Hunterkll> now they just use embedded eMMC like pricks instead
[09:39:40] <Telgareith> poor eMMC
[09:39:47] <Telgareith> everybody abusing it giving it a bad name
[09:40:43] <Hunterkll> i've been giving it a bad name for 20 years....
[09:41:28] <Telgareith> Hey
[09:41:33] <Telgareith> I have a copy of sheep.exe!
[09:41:55] <Telgareith> ghost 2003
[09:42:34] <Telgareith> zone alarm
[09:42:50] <Telgareith> that was handy for knowing when you ran a bad keygen
[09:45:58] <Hunterkll> i actually prefer memory that requires scanning during format for bad blocks and marking them at the filesystem layer to eMMC
[09:45:58] <Hunterkll> lol
[09:46:05] <Hunterkll> or MMC in general...

[23:39:31] <JollyRgrs> in many US states where hurricanes come into play, there are very strong hurricane building codes to make sure the roof trusses are attached to teh building securely
[23:39:35] <Activ8> im in an end terraced
[23:39:53] <JollyRgrs> affects the stats? what "stats"?
[23:39:54] <sd> 11<H‚Äãotmess> yeah we have to use roof anchors too
[23:40:03] <sd> 11<H‚Äãotmess> trees falling on ppl in houses
[23:40:04] <JollyRgrs> sure, there's many trailers that people live in, too
[23:40:08] <Activ8> The stats on how many get ripped up I guess lol
[23:40:30] <JollyRgrs> or... that we get way more hurricanes than UK does?
[23:40:32] <Activ8> we had a caravan park close to me completely ripped up and everyone inside thrown out nobody dead luckily!!!
[23:40:36] <sd> 11<H‚Äãotmess> that too
[23:40:46] <sd> 11<H‚Äãotmess> we only get a few and there is only like 3-5 deaths for each one
[23:40:46] <JollyRgrs> it isn't the houses that blow over, it's the roofs that get destroyed
