[07:42:39] <mike18_> there that number is an id
[07:42:58] <mike18_> i mean remove all other rows which dont have that id :)
[07:43:22] <mike18_> id = 1,2,3 are only allowed lets say
[07:44:33] <mike18_> awk -F= '$3 !~ /1|2|3/' file.txt ... something like that
[07:44:39] <larryv> you want to edit the file and save it?
[07:44:54] <mike18_> just save the change in the original file

[07:47:14] <mike18_> its a csv file
[07:47:53] <mike18_> e.g.: "2022-02-16","2022-02-16",1,6602,9.90763723,0.00000000    ... where 1 is that id: allowed ids: 1,2,3 for example
[07:48:26] <mike18_> awk might work for that?
[07:48:40] <e36freak> could assuming you never have a , in the first two fields
[07:48:42] <mike18_> awk -F= '$3 !~ /1|2|3/' file.txt ... someling like that?
[07:48:59] <e36freak> why would you use -F= ?

[07:49:04] <e36freak> it's a comma, not an =
[07:49:15] <mike18_> which fieldname1,fiedlname2, .... etc
[07:49:40] <e36freak> ok, so print the first line first
[07:49:49] <e36freak> still don't understand why you'd use -F=

[07:51:15] <mike18_> id2=222 ?
[07:51:20] <mike18_> 3 ids allowed
[07:51:24] <e36freak> why 3?

[10:34:54] <vancz> yeah but where's the sigpipe then? isn't that when it's supposed to get it?
[10:35:08] <vancz> or do you only get sigpipe once you've got past the open and _then_ the reader falls off the bus
[10:35:26] <geirha> sigpip is then the reader closes the pipe before the writer

[10:47:54] <geirha> if the fifo gets multiple, simultaneous readers, then it's hard to predict what happens
[10:47:55] <vancz> ...ok yeah or various other race condition behaviours
[10:47:58] <vancz> yeah
[10:48:27] <vancz> that is the one caveat of my solution that I did think of - its not designed to handle multiple simultaneous access attempts

[10:49:43] <vancz> im confused again
[10:50:05] <vancz> if echo whatever >&fifofd doesnt  call close(), how does the reader know it's finished reading
[10:50:21] <vancz> or does reaching the end of the FIFO cause EOF
[10:50:32] <vancz> in which case ok that's fine I guess
[10:50:33] *** Joins: grettke (~grettke@cpe-65-29-228-30.wi.res.rr.com)
[10:50:34] <geirha> depends on the reader. It might be satisified with a single line of input, and just exit
[10:50:51] <vancz> if that was true then I wouldn't have had the RAM blowing problem
[10:50:58] <geirha> if the reader were  read -r line   or  head -n1   that would be true
[10:51:00] <vancz> for this reader
[10:51:13] <vancz> *for the program I'm using this with
[10:51:51] <vancz> what I would actually have expected is the read blocks <vancz> or does reaching the end of the FIFO cause EOF
[10:51:56] <geirha> if the reader is cat, then it will not close, it will continue reading until it gets EOF
[10:52:19] <vancz> hm. maybe the program checks the size of the file or something and reads that much?
[10:52:40] <vancz> then it would only ever read at most the buffer size of the fifo?
[10:52:41] <geirha> there's no size attribute to go with a fifo
[10:52:44] <vancz> aha
[10:52:57] <vancz> that's reasonable
[10:53:16] <geirha> Either it reads and parses the input, then decides, ok I found the "terminator token" or whatever, and exits
[10:53:27] <geirha> or it just reads and reads until it receives EOF
[10:53:54] <geirha> read -r line    will read until it sees a newline, then exit
[10:54:01] <geirha> cat   will read until it gets EOF

[10:54:40] <vancz> ok , then I'm still lost how this even works. re: originally I was blowing the RAM echoing the output of the loop into the FIFO and having the application read it
[10:54:56] <vancz> maybe...the whole thng is a race condition?
[10:55:18] <vancz> echoing individual lines is slow enought that the application only reads one line
[10:56:12] <geirha> I don't know. Maybe I'm wrong about bash ignoring SIGPIPE when it's handling a PIPE trap. Maybe it instead causes infinite recursion
[10:56:52] <geirha> write fails, triggers a SIGPIPE which cases write to be run again, write fails, triggers a SIGPIPE, ...
[10:56:53] <vancz> I haven't even got to the point of understanding this where that becomes relevant
[10:57:04] <vancz> but I think that was the original idea yes
[10:57:38] <vancz> infrec would be a problem, maybe the handler is instead interrupted?
[10:57:43] <vancz> nah
[10:57:48] * vancz shrugs
[10:58:33] <vancz> the thing is, the echo write happens before the printf that should trigger the sigpipe
[10:58:36] <geirha> perhaps when it recieves another SIGPIPE while handling a SIGPIPE, it queues it up
[10:59:00] <vancz> so unless theres something where it doesnt empty the write buffer before getting interrupted or something, the echo write should still show up
[10:59:21] <vancz> and thats where this whole head scratching started: write only ever gets written to the screen once
[10:59:58] <geirha> it shows up because you eplicitly run the write function once, but then the write to pipe succeeds, so no SIGPIPE is triggered

[11:03:02] <vancz> ^ this is the question, I see that I wasn't clear about that
[11:03:15] <vancz> the question isn't why me calling write , writes write to the screen once

[11:06:43] <vancz> so, here is the code again:

[11:07:12] <vancz> it should block on exec 5>wat
[11:07:21] <vancz> right?

[15:38:31] <geirha> it seems to be saying that an IP is not a valid ID

[15:41:41] *** Quits: jmdaemon (~jmdaemon@user/jmdaemon) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[15:41:42] <Soliton> does "defining the variable $ItemID" mean how you build the json?
[15:41:59] <Soliton> it's not great but perhaps good enough here.
[15:42:54] <Soliton> if you clearly understand that you're giving the api dots and it clearly tells you not to do that why do you think there is any other issue?
[15:43:02] <tercaL> Soliton, no, in json, is this a valid format of having $ItemID as IP address -> '{"items":[{"id":"'"$ItemID"'"}]}'
[15:43:04] <tercaL> ?
[15:43:32] <Soliton> that is not json that is a piece of shell code.
[15:43:34] <tercaL> Regular already-defined one (and works): '{"items":[{"id":"123.123.123.123"}]}'
[15:44:10] <Soliton> well, that makes no sense.
[15:44:15] <Earnestly> tercaL: You're not sending an ip address
[15:44:24] <Earnestly> You're sending the literal text: "$ItemID"
[15:44:30] <geirha> it's valid json, but since the rest api does not allow "." in its id, it doesn't matter if the json is valid or not

[15:46:03] <Earnestly> I'm not reading properly.  I don't like to not use jq to generate json

[17:56:11] <greybot> A zombie process (also known as a "defunct" process) cannot be killed; it's already dead. A zombie is a process which has exited, but whose parent has not yet waited for it (or wait3()ed for it) to collect its exit status. This often signifies a bug in the parent, unless the time of zombification is brief.

[18:36:59] <greybot> basename(1) can strip the directory and extension from a path (dir/subdir/file.ext -> file.ext or file). A parameter expansion can do it cleaner and *much* faster: "${path##*/}", "${path%.*}", at the cost of missing edge cases like path=/ or path=/path/to/dir/

[21:04:53] <OnlineCop> If I were using ls, then the `ls -A` suggestion would have worked, but it's really that `shopt -s dotglob` and `set -x` that I probably needed

[21:05:10] <emanuele6> !xtrace
[21:05:10] <greybot> set -x (or ''bash -x myscript'') makes bash output the exact command that it will run after parsing and expansion. You can put ''set -x'' just before the code you want to debug (turn off with ''set +x''). To add more information, change PS4 first: eg. PS4='+($?) $BASH_SOURCE:$FUNCNAME:$LINENO:'
[21:05:29] <OnlineCop> Dunno. It was suggested. I used what someone here told me to do. `rm -rf /` and all that. Blindly.
[21:05:35] <emanuele6> and why do do you need dotglob?
[21:05:57] <Nod0n[m]> You can find files with the find command. You can then search there content with: find /my/path -iname 'pattern' -type f -exec grep 'my.*search.*pattern' {} ;

[22:21:33] <rkta> This article http://www.cons.org/cracauer/sigint.html has the example "trap 'rm -f $TMP ; trap 2 ; kill -2 $$' 1 2 3 13 15". Is a good habit to just use kill -2 or should one use different traps for each signal and kill with the correspoding signal?
[22:21:36] *** Joins: fstd (~fstd@xdsl-78-34-125-135.nc.de)
[22:22:47] <Soliton> it's for simplicity. ideally you would kill with the proper signal.
[22:22:53] <greycat> INT (2) is special.  That's the whole point of that page.
[22:23:32] <rkta> greycat: They say the same applies to QUIT.
[22:23:45] <greycat> But no, I wouldn't share the INT trap with all the other signals.  It should be separate.
[22:24:10] <greycat> And bash lets you avoid most of this by just using EXIT for your trap.  sh does not.
[22:25:26] <rkta> yep, but I'm using sh. I use seperate traps.

[22:25:57] <phogg> if I bind '"\ez":"\C-@\C-]"' the first sequence (ctrl @) is not run and I don't get set-mark. If I also bind '"C-t": set-mark' and then change @ to a t it works. What do I have to do to get it to send @ there?
