[00:13:32] <random-nick> hmm, why does WITH-ACCESSORS not have the simple variant of slot-entry like WITH-SLOTS does?
[00:14:31] <pjb> because accessor names are often longer than what you'd want for a variable name.
[00:14:50] <pjb> (with-accessors ((x point-x) (c point-color)) (incf x) (setf c 'red))

[02:02:34] <Shinmera> That reminds me that I initially created https://portability.cl in the faint hopes it would drive people to try and improve the situation on either library or implementation sides, but as far as I can tell it actually changed nothing at all.
[02:03:33] <Shinmera> So far my impression writing several of these libraries is that unless you do the painful work of aggregating the info for 90% of the implementations out there that you don't even use, nobody'll bother contributing a backend for even one more.
[02:04:08] <Shinmera> Or maybe I'm just impatient
[02:05:23] <Bike> i did a few from the implementation end, but i guess that's not quite the same
[02:05:31] <Bike> i should submit PRs, since i added a cltl2 interface in clasp

[02:06:24] <NotThatRPG> Shinmera: If you look into the crawling horror that is the ASDF source, you will see what it takes... I don't know that anyone besides Fare has the energy to fight through testing on all the various implementations out there.
[02:06:52] <Krystof> (sb-c:source-location) gets you a source location for that form in sbcl, I think

[02:07:32] <Shinmera> I'm not aiming my laments at anyone in particular, to be clear
[02:07:43] <Shinmera> Just woes about the general state of affairs, nothing new :)
[02:08:29] <Bike> a lot of these aren't actually that bad assuming the implementation has support. trivial-extensible-sequences support on sbcl consists of #+sbcl #:sb-sequence for example
[02:08:54] <Bike> but in that case there's a well defined protocol people pretty much go with, which is not the case with e.g. all the compile-file extensions asdf tries to herd

[02:30:41] <Shinmera> I have often thought about starting a thing for a secondary path mechanism that's more tailored towards modern systems, and adding support for that to implementations, but doing so is too much effort even for me.

[02:32:25] <Fare> but then you have to hook it up into LOAD and all other primitives that deal with paths.
[02:32:33] <Shinmera> did it? My idea would have been to allow using cl:open/etc with this new path type.
[02:32:42] <Shinmera> Right.
[02:32:47] <Fare> yeah, that's the part that's definitely not portable.
[02:35:08] <Fare> Also, anything that binds wrapped low-level resources to high-level variables introduces "interesting" issues to make your program async-safe. No one tries to do that because it's too hard (except for the Erlang guys maybe), but I wonder what an async-safe lisp would look like.
[02:35:32] <Shinmera> doing async in lisp is depressing in many ways :(

[07:35:44] <semz> good morning
[07:37:54] <_death> Guest74: why wouldn't it work?
[07:38:38] <Guest74> your readme says the mapping is read only.
[07:39:09] <Guest74> and private.  I think dumb buffers are shared.
[07:42:46] <_death> like I said, these limitations are not inherent to the approach.. but looking at DRM dumb buffers, it indeed might not work, because you don't get to pick the buffer's offset
[07:44:16] <_death> maybe you could create an alias mapping, not looked into it
[07:44:53] <Guest74> ah, I just read the readme and haven't looked at the code yet.  It might be useful for clx though. X allows you to provide the mmap.
[07:45:00] *** Joins: Catie (~user@user/catie)
[07:47:02] <Guest74> it's just something that would be interesting for the future. copying the array to foreign is sort of a poor mans double buffering.
[07:47:15] <_death> the way it works is to have a page before the pages of interest where the last bytes are the array's header
[07:47:36] <Guest74> that makes sense
[07:51:06] <Guest74> that will probably work really nice for x if there's no problem pinning it.
[07:51:46] <Guest74> I was just thinking of the shared memory extension, but sounds like it'd possibly work for the buffer as well.
[07:51:47] <_death> it's foreign memory, so no need for pinning

[09:40:17] <dre> oh shit
[09:40:32] <dre> the test input is 5 binary digits, but the real input is like 10
[09:40:38] <dre> 12
[09:40:40] <Catie> Guest74: This is what I came up with, I don't think it looks that bad: http://ix.io/3GQq

[09:44:21] <dre> oh damn this really has me a bit stumped.
[09:44:37] <dre> how did others do the "count for each position" ?
[09:44:50] <Catie> dre: maybe this? http://ix.io/3GQr
[09:44:54] <dre> originally I just hard-coded first second third .. etc.
[09:45:33] <dre> Catie, ??? that's count in that row, but I want to count in the column.
[09:46:13] <dre> transpose? is that possible? no idea
[09:46:37] <mfiano> Here's an idea. Store an array of integers if you actually need an integer
[09:47:08] <mfiano> bit vectors don't really buy you anything over a fixnum, except more bits, and lots of consing using the result of a bignum
[09:47:54] <dre> is that to me?
[09:48:13] <dre> I've got the test solution worked out, https://gist.github.com/Dotrar/dcd4bf24dc4dcec0f11eeb1cfaea2583
[09:48:25] <dre> I just need to re-do that top count-ones-per-position function
[09:48:50] <dre> something like nthcar for each index of the first element?
[09:49:05] <Catie> mapcar'ing over many lists in parallel processes their elements in order, similar to how you hard-coded first, second, etc
[09:49:47] <dre> and just store the int/counts?
[09:50:02] <beach> dre: You need to start paying more attention to your code layout.  Sometimes LET is followed by 1 space, sometimes by 2, sometimes by 0.  Sometimes COERCE is followed by a newline, sometimes not.
[09:50:07] <dre> wait no, we could just mapcar, then sum

[12:23:32] <beach> abrahms`: Please try to lay out your code according to conventions.  A closing parenthesis should not be preceded by whitespace.
[12:24:06] <beach> abrahms`: And there is no reason for a blank line inside a top-level expression.
[12:24:30] <beach> abrahms`: Nor for two consecutive blank lines.
[12:24:46] <abrahms`> beach: is there a handy linter you recommend?
[12:25:13] <beach> I am unaware of one.
[12:25:56] <beach> Also, your use of (caddr acc) as a Boolean value is a violation of the rules stated on page 13 of the LUV slides by Norvig and Pitman.
[12:26:02] <abrahms`> Ah. I tend to be a bit of a pain in that I gave up arguing about code style and now I just insist that there's either a tool or no one cares enough for it to matter to me.
[12:26:17] <abrahms`> tbh, I'm 20% sure you're trolling me right now.
[12:26:18] <beach> And your PROGN is unnecessary if it has a single form in its body.
[12:27:23] <abrahms`> How do you prefer to do nil checks if not using their presence as a boolean?
[12:27:25] <flip214> abrahms`: well, the indentation rules are built into the "important" editors emacs (and vim), so it takes work to get it wrong... therefore there's no linter
[12:27:45] <beach> abrahms`: Not at all.  When you submit code for others to read, it is important to follow conventions, or you are going to waste the time of people reading your code, simply because they are going to be distracted by all those cases where conventions are not followed.
[12:27:47] <abrahms`> flip214: I wrote all of that code w/ emacs, so.. ?
[12:28:12] <abrahms`> beach: the thing that threw me off was the quoting of the rules. :) Sounds very serious business.
[12:28:33] <beach> abrahms`: If it is a true Boolean, then in an IF it is fine.  But if it is NIL as a default value, then (NULL <that value>) is preferable.
[12:29:12] <abrahms`> The code alternates between there being a function there and there being a nil. That denotes whether we're waiting on an incoming command or an incoming integer.
[12:29:37] <beach> That doesn't alter what Norvig and Pitman describe.
[12:30:51] <beach> abrahms`: Note that I am not talking about language semantics here.  It is about the message that you send to the person reading your code.
[12:31:19] <beach> abrahms`: And since you are submitting your code for others to read, I am giving you the feedback as one such person.
[12:32:57] <abrahms`> beach: Cool. I appreciate the feedback.  I'm not clear on how my use of if to check if something is nil or a function violates the "be as specific as your data abstractions warrant" from slide 13. http://www.norvig.com/luv-slides.pdf
[12:33:49] <AndrewYu> p,
[12:33:54] <AndrewYu> oops sry
[12:37:04] <lisp123> abrahms`: You could try (defun function-exists-p (acc) (caddr acc)) or something like that. Although I would put it as a local function if its not meant to be used elsewhere
[12:38:01] <lisp123> Just looking at the code, I would have no idea what (caddr acc) means (i'm not even sure if its function-exists-p, but I'm guess based on this chat), and in a few months you might also forget ;)
[12:38:27] <lisp123> At least from my personal experience, I found it better to write very clear code vs. having to spend hours later trying to figure out WTF i did
[12:39:07] <abrahms`> It's a good callout. I haven't gone back and edited it, but after showing this to someone, they told me about destructuring bind which simplifies some of the shenanigans in there.

[12:42:24] <lisp123> Although I personally have been avoiding its use to some degree, I think it might cause interface & implementation to overlap
[12:43:23] <lisp123> Since you are assuming a list structure. If later you wanted to use a structure or class to represent the data object, then you will have to go back and rewrite all parts of your code that rely on it being alist
[12:43:55] <beach> abrahms`: What lisp123 says.  If your value can be a function or NIL, then you can use FUNCTIONP or NULL to test one way or the other.  If it is a Boolean, i.e., it is either true or false, using it directly in the TEST of an IF is fine.
[12:44:10] <abrahms`> I haven't played much w/ the non-list data types in a long while. I did PCL ~5+ years ago and I don't use common lisp regularly. Just picked it up for advent of code.

[13:22:49] <beach> I keep being puzzled by this phenomenon.  Even some professional programmers seem to be unaware of the existence of coding conventions.  Is it that the existence of such conventions is not taught?  Or is it that these professional programmers have not had any training?  I am not talking specific coding conventions for specific languages, but even the very existence of conventions seems to be questioned here from time to time.
[13:25:53] <susam> If you observe this phenomenon in younger programmers, it totally makes sense. I don't say this with the intention of being disrespectful. It's just the reality today. A lot of people who get into programming these days, get into it with motives different than what we had when we were younger. For example, for many programming might just be a way to earn money and they do not care about it beyond their

[13:26:41] <hayley> Can't reproduce that here, sorry.
[13:26:53] <beach> That, I understand.  What I don't understand is how these people managed to get hired to become professional programmers.
[13:27:14] <hayley> For some people, perhaps, but they're older than me (but then, say 25 is "older" for me, and not for you two).
[13:28:14] <susam> Because hiring at many company these days focuses on solving leetcode type problems and some system design round. None of these really evaluates exposure to "programming culture".
[13:28:45] <beach> Hmm.
[13:30:09] <susam> I remember, 15 years ago, when I was conducting an interview, I used to ask the candidates if they have developed any side projects using their technology of interest. I wanted to know what kind of passion they have for programming. I considered asking such questions completely fine back then.
[13:30:25] *** Quits: s-liao (~s-liao@101.86.99.70) (Quit: Client closed)
[13:30:26] <hayley> I guess. I've thought to myself that those people would be better off growing vegetables (or literally participating in any other profession), since otherwise they seem to think very negatively of programming.
[13:31:04] <hayley> *participating in literally any other profession; word scheduling is important there.
[13:31:11] <susam> But today I think such questions may be considered controversial. In fact, I myself find it controversial. One might argue, what side projects they do is none of my business. One might argue, that I must focus on what they do on job only.
[13:32:48] <lisp123> Eh, this all sounds elitism to be honest. There's no right way and most of these subpar programmers are producing useful code, however inefficient it may be written
[13:32:53] <hayley> Well, short of some uninteresting very short jobs I had in high school, the résumé I wrote but never used only has side projects arguably.
[13:33:02] <beach> I can understand why one can aspire to a profession without being passionate about it, but it is truly shocking to me that there is no filtering process.
[13:33:27] <hayley> lisp123: It's unrelated to being a subpar programmer or not, though the people I am thinking of seem to actively encourage rubbish programming style.
[13:33:50] <susam> lisp123: I see your point and it can indeed sound like elitism and that's why I don't share this often with others. But in my heart, I know I feel disappointed to see the craftmanship in this field gradually eroding.
[13:34:21] <beach> lisp123: I am frequently accused of being elitist, but when I see the bugs in devices like the TV decoder or the microwave oven, I think there is a huge problem in the industry.
[13:34:36] <susam> lisp123: By the way, are you ab....22 on HN?
[13:35:30] <lisp123> hayley: In 'theory' there is definitely a clear divide between good code vs. bad code, good programming style vs. bad programming style. But often it might be because they were optimising for something else (less time to study / learn, spending more time on getting a proof of concept)
[13:35:40] <hayley> My motives involve using the computer as a means of self-expression, and as a device to slack off all day. The latter part incidentally requires that I don't write bad code, else I would be stuck spending more time maintaining it.
[13:35:43] <cranium> don't know about craftsmanship, but it's silly to expect professional programmers, i.e. people who already do this all day, to have side projects.
[13:35:47] <Nilby> I've worked with many programmers in industry and academia, and my observation is following coding conventions is highly correlated with some ineffable personality traits, but not practical skill or education. Even when it's attempted to be enforced, it can fail.
[13:36:25] <lisp123> (So I agree with all of your comments, but (not related at this group), often its not because said programmers or professionals were doing a 'bad' job, but they were focusing on different things)

[13:37:49] <hayley> lisp123: I think those targets for optimisation are subjective too. With regards on getting a proof of concept: I have heard some people to write buggy code to illustrate a point. Some other people, like Leslie Lamport, argue that having a mathematical model suffices as a proof of concept, and if such a model can be checked, it is probably not buggy too.
[13:37:55] <beach> lisp123: You misunderstood my opinion.  I expect no such thing.  I merely expect people to recognize that there is such a thing as coding conventions, separate from the concept of semantics.
[13:37:56] * rotateq experienced some filtering: "Oh, you can't do Java or some of our other mainstream web/app technologies and just understand things well we don't know? Then we cannot use you."
[13:38:24] <pve> It may be that if someone is trying to learn a new language by themselves, they do not prioritize learning conventions early on, even if they know such a thing exists. It only becomes a problem when they go on irc and try to show their code.

[13:40:49] <beach> cranium: The "Boolean vs. default value" issue can hardly be automated.
[13:41:12] <hayley> Once I went and looked at some automated code "quality" tool (which did not support Common Lisp, of course), and looked at the warnings it produced. The warnings consisted of stuff like "There is a line with nothing but spaces on it." Who actually cares about that?
[13:41:13] <rotateq> So things like those Norvig covers in his style guide.
[13:41:15] <lisp123> susam: No idea on that
[13:41:39] <pve> beach: I understand. Though, I could see someone considering Lisp so alien in the beginning, that the notion of "conventions" flies out the window.
[13:41:54] <susam> lisp123: No idea about? Sorry, I couldn't figure which message you are replying to.
[13:41:54] <beach> Hmm.
[13:41:55] <lisp123> hayley: Sure, I think the argument goes both ways. "My code was bad because I was focusing on "business"", when it was just bad
[13:42:32] <hayley> lisp123: Your business is damned if you do nitpick your code, and damned if you don't.
[13:43:09] <mzan> The best solution is like "go fmt". You code is formatted automatically by a tool.
[13:43:24] <susam> Haha! That's quite true, hayley! I love it and I am going to steal your line and use it in future.
[13:43:41] <lisp123> beach: Sorry, I was probably slightly confused. I think that following good coding conventions is positively correlated to good code quality, so one should expect poor adherence to coding conventions in the same way one should expect poor code quality (because it does and will keep happening)
[13:46:09] <mzan> Hi, I'm stuck on this https://dpaste.com/9G6666P3K The function using "series" is not compiled to an efficient loop.
[13:46:38] <mzan> I'm using CL for AoC 2021, and I'm trying to use "series" whenever possible.
[13:47:38] <hayley> I'm not too familiar with Series, so what does COLLECT-LAST do?
[13:47:38] <mzan> The code is working, but I'm not happy knowing that if the input file is too big, it will crash, because it should be compiled to an efficient loop working on streams.
[13:47:54] <mzan> hayley: collect-last take the last element of a series
[13:48:18] <mzan> So it should be a loop on all elements of the series (i.e. random numbers), discard them, and then return the last element.
[13:48:27] <hayley> Why even produce N random integers then?
[13:48:36] <mzan> Because I tried to isolate the problem.
[13:48:49] <mzan> I have the same problem on real code, but with a lot more complex series.
[13:50:34] <mzan> I like series because I used  Haskell a lot in the past, and so they seems rather natural for me. It seems also a way to create more useable code respect an explicit loop.

I think perhaps the blame should lie on all the teachers (online blogs / videos / fellow coders / (perhaps universities, but I wouldn't know since I didn't do a CS degree)) --> Had there been a stronger teaching of the importance of various concepts, some of these bad practices wouldn't propagate as much
[13:52:57] <susam> I doubt any CS degree has ever taught what I call the "hacker culture". It is something we used to pick up by working with other developers and seeing how well established open source projects are executed. For example, when I sent my first patches to an Apache project some 15 years ago, there were multiple rounds of reviews and I learnt a lot about the culture. Other sources were just browsing online
[13:53:03] <susam> and searching and reading about things.
[13:53:44] <lisp123> susam: Isn't that the issue though? It should have taught these things properly vs. you finding them own as you were passionate / intelligent / hard working. Because we can't expect all to be the same
[13:54:52] <mzan> susam: in fact some folks suggests to follow the pull-request workflow of goo OSS projects. Studying the code is useful, but reading the pull-requests can give many hints about the standards they are following.
[13:55:13] <lisp123> I programmed as a side hobby during school and later on, but I only learnt about interface vs. implementation from #CLSCHOOL and studying lisp --> Is that a failing of myself or of the system
[13:55:57] <susam> lisp123: I agree that there is an issue but I am not sure where the solution lies. For example, I don't have a CS degree, so even if they did teach these things as part of a degree, most people like me wouldn't learn it.

[13:56:55] <hayley> I just don't think computer science courses ever make anything seem fun. Say, one assignment might be about a made-up Mr. Robert who had an idiot intern mess up his database which seems awfully poorly constructed just so that you get to practise one particular aspect of your programming language. If it's supposed to give industrial experience, it comes off an awful like an old fable, where the entire world is constructed to teach one stupid
[13:56:55] <hayley> lesson to the audience.
[13:58:06] <hayley> Speaking of, the two "hackathons" I participated in were devoid of any hacking, and they were solely to come up with ideas to impress someone from a big tech company, who might even hire you to let them steal your idea if you're lucky.
[13:58:21] <susam> I just think it is a dilution and erosion of craftmanship which is natural when a field grows so much that it attracts everyone (the passionate and the dispassionate). Say, playing piano was as hot a field as computing is today. Say, anyone who can write a 30 second jingle with some basic notes gets a job and earns money. I am willing to bet that we would see the same erosion of craftmanship in that

In "Personal dynamic media" <http://www.newmediareader.com/book_samples/nmr-26-kay.pdf> there are quite a few brilliant programs...written by children. It's really insulting when I was 18 upon entering university, and spent a whole semester writing programs which would read and write crap into a hash table, more or less.

[17:49:36] <jackdaniel> the object itself is an unique id
[17:49:49] <lisp123> I am thinking GENSYM. But also considering whether its possible to get the number e.g. in #<TEST2 {1009F8F2F3}>
[17:50:05] <lisp123> That's a memory address so is subject to change? Or is it relatively constant

[19:41:26] <beach> Guest74: Again, I am not surprised that specific conventions for specific languages, including Common Lisp, are not known by relative newbies.  And that is not a problem either, because those conventions can be learned.  My surprise is that some people don't acknowledge that there is such a thing as conventions in software development, so they don't understand the importance of such conventions.
[19:45:12] <jackdaniel> do we take convention as something that is the most commonly used or something that would be considered "more correct" under /some/ criteria?
[19:45:43] <jackdaniel> i.e using #+nil to disable code seems to represent the former and using #+(or) the latter

[20:54:59] <lisp123> If so, use something like this https://pastebin.com/rB7z95Vg
[20:55:20] <NotThatRPG> lisp123: Well sort of -- the FiveAM entities have symbols for names, and I would like to look them up akin to the way I do on Allegro (CCL is similar): (excl:source-file 'add-2 :fiveam-test)
[20:56:21] <NotThatRPG> On Allegro and CCL there's a protocol to invoke source file recording, e.g., when doing macroexpansion of a defining form.
[20:56:23] <lisp123> sb-introspect:find-definition-source and equivalent functions will help. Look at the sb-introspect.lisp (I think that's what its called) package to figure out which ones you need to use
[20:56:44] <NotThatRPG> lisp123: Thanks, will do!
[20:58:44] <lisp123> Yeah looks like that is what you are after, play around with it and then use it as you want...since a symbol can refer to variables / functions / etc., SBCL will return a list of source locations, so you need to parse that list to get what you are after

[21:03:34] *** Joins: Catie (~user@user/catie)
[21:04:17] <lisp123> If you look at the code I sent earlier (I do it for generic functions / macros / functions, but not other types of symbols), there's another function called find-definition-source that is more helpful, but expects you give it a lisp object and not a name
[21:04:19] <lisp123> IIRC
[21:05:06] <NotThatRPG> Looks like line 406
[21:05:13] <NotThatRPG> (at least in my copy)
[21:05:21] <lisp123> yes, that's the one
[21:05:54] <NotThatRPG> Also hard-coded. This time typecase.
[21:06:40] <NotThatRPG> Turning those into generic functions seems like a reasonable move, but potentially a total waste of time if the maintainers were not interested in seeing such a change.
[21:07:04] <lisp123> TBH I think that function is pretty good already
[21:07:25] <lisp123> you need to ultimately supply a lisp object right
[21:07:38] <NotThatRPG> yes, but it has to be one of a known set of classes.
[21:07:59] <NotThatRPG> The protocol offered by CCL and ACL seems significantly preferable
[21:07:59] <lisp123> I think it covers nearly all cases no?
[21:08:22] <lisp123> This is the magic line (find-definition-source (class-of object))
[21:09:05] <lisp123> By all means, if there is a way to improve it, please do let them know as it would be very useful for a lot of us. I assumed it worked well
[21:10:04] <NotThatRPG> lisp123: Give me a minute, and I will make a pastebin for you to see the comparison

[21:12:24] <Krystof> so having a generic function in the middle isn't particularly helpful
[21:13:40] <Krystof> I'd like to see the comparison with the CCL/ACL protocol but it should also cover retrieving and using the source location
[21:13:43] <Bike> NotThatRPG: is this protocol documented somewhere?
[21:16:01] <NotThatRPG> Krystof, lisp123, @Bike : Here's a pastebin that shows use of the protocol -- TL;DR: it works like the protocol for CL:DOCUMENTATION https://pastebin.com/NVkGiJFy
[21:16:37] <NotThatRPG> Franz has very good docs about source file recording: https://franz.com/support/documentation/current/doc/source-file-recording.htm
[21:17:30] <NotThatRPG> I couldn't find anything comparable for CCL (but I might easily have overlooked something). It was pretty easy to adapt the ACL method, except that it required an additional step of registering a new definition type.
[21:17:43] <NotThatRPG> (this is shown in the paste)
[21:17:45] <Krystof> ok, but my point stands: there's no actual advantage to a generic excl:source-file if you never call it with a variable second argument
[21:18:31] <NotThatRPG> Krystof: You mean like (excl:source-file 'add-2 :fiveam-test) ? I'm not sure I follow the question.
[21:18:49] <jackdaniel> it is excl:record-source-file name :type type) <--
[21:18:57] <jackdaniel> clearly a keyword, you don't specialize on keyword parameters
[21:19:00] <Krystof> I mean like (defun find-add-2-definitions (x) (excl:source-file 'add-2 x))
[21:19:12] <Bike> i think what Krystof means it that if a consumer (slime, say) doesn't know :fiveam-test is valid, it will never do it, so what's the point

[21:20:09] <Krystof> If the set of all possible types is exposed somewhere, which it might be, I can imagine a totally-generic "definition source navigator" providing an interface to that, so this is not a complete "no"
[21:20:20] <Bike> ACL's "source-file" function has an optional type argument, like jackdaniel said, and if it's T it returns an alist of all info regardless of type
[21:20:41] <Bike> which seems like exactly what you'd want for something like slime
[21:20:50] <Krystof> but I bet in those circumstances you would want something to convert :fiveam-test into "FiveAM test"
[21:21:05] <NotThatRPG> I already use this a lot for Domain Specific Languages to look up program constructs generated by various macros and parsers
[21:21:37] <Krystof> Bike: I think it's some of what you'd want for something like slime / a clim "definition inspector", but in practice I think you'd want more
[21:21:38] <NotThatRPG> It's simple and elegant, and ... I don't see how I would do anything like it with SB-INTROSPECT.

[21:22:07] <NotThatRPG> Maybe it's possible, but the source isn't enough to tell me how to do it.
[21:22:12] <Bike> yeah, you'd probably want to print it more nicely, true, but having the info at all seems likea  necessary starting point
[21:22:45] <lisp123> Although I'm still missing what SB-INTROSPECT cant' do
[21:23:02] <lisp123> It looks up the lisp object, which should be unique
[21:23:18] <jackdaniel> lisp123: 'foo may represent a function, a class etc
[21:23:37] <lisp123> jackdaniel: Yeah, so one has to pass in the right object

[21:34:29] <NotThatRPG> Krystof: If one is building something with a domain specific language, having an extensible set of definition types seems critical. I'd rather have just a symbol naming the type, instead of being shackled to a fixed set of definition types.
[21:34:41] <Krystof> without a protocol, how can slime know how to display a heading for your fiveam definition locations (other than :fiveam-fixture)

[21:39:57] <Bike> with the addition of some mechanism to get all possible metadata about an object regardless of type, the protocol seems roughly fine
[21:39:59] <Krystof> its contents are not well-specified enough (you get a string!  Woot.  Good luck using it) and you specifically can't find out about all the different kinds of entities supported

[23:25:20] <Guest74> nevermind, seems it has no facility to build queries. quri it is.  Would have been nice to use quri as drakma accepts that.
[23:28:44] <kagevf> semz: parenscript is a sub-set of CL that produces javascript
[23:36:24] <Guest74> any reasons to prefer drakma over dexador?

[23:42:48] <jackdaniel> it has a cooler name
[23:43:56] <jackdaniel> on top of that it has a good documentation and (most likely) its source code is more readable / hackable (knowing both authors style)

[23:51:13] <Guest74> I actually don't see anything wrong with the dexador documentation.
[23:51:29] <Guest74> source seems fine.
[23:54:13] <Guest74> Anyways, if anybody knows any real issues I'll read the logs.  Seems easier to use with easier query construction with quri.
