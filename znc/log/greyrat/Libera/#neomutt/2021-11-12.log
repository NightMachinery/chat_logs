[12:53:59] <ckardaris> If a user had the following macro it would break the expected behavior: macro index M "<compose-to-sender><enter>"
[12:55:23] <ckardaris> But this macro would be a workaround to achieve what the patch will be doing anyway. Let me know what you think and if you can think of any other

[14:41:44] <ckardaris> gahr: I don't have these settings enabled, but they don't do exactly what I am describing. The desired behavior is that if I know the recipient already, don't edit it and move on. Also I don't like that it has to be combined with edit_headers. Another option mentioned in the auto_edit section of the neomuttrc page is the fast_reply. I have this one enabled. Evidently, the two can't play together
[14:41:47] <ckardaris> as described in the man page (fast_reply section). The whole issue seems a little tricky, because the behavioral flow is affected by many different settings, with each one cancelling the other. Maybe a new setting would make sense then :P  
[14:42:48] <gahr> perhaps we should enable fast_reply even for compose-to-sender
[14:43:15] <gahr> I guess the rationale for fast_reply is exactly what you suggest: if I know the recipient, don't prompt
[14:43:23] <gahr> that is true for replies, but it's even true for compose-to-sender
[14:43:38] <gahr> my wild guess: compose-to-sender was introduced later, and fast_reply was left behind
[14:45:10] *** Joins: Martin[XMPP] (c941dec6bd@89-72-190-170.dynamic.chello.pl)
[14:49:29] <ckardaris> interesting. The same should apply to command line arguments as well then. So in essense, if the addresslist is not empty (I have seen it existing in the parts of the code we are talking about) we should enable fast_reply (I have not verified where it is changed). But fast_reply should be enabled only for the recipient part
[14:50:32] <gahr> so you still want to edit the subject etc?
[14:50:48] <ckardaris> why not?
[14:51:21] <gahr> for compose-to-sender it makes sense, because we don't have a default
[14:51:31] <gahr> for reply, we do have a subject, so it doesn't really make sense
[14:51:48] <ckardaris> From what I am seeing fast_reply can skip recipients and subject when replying, subject when forwarding
[14:51:52] <gahr> so perhaps fast_reply doesn't match 100%
[14:52:09] <gahr> interesting
[14:52:10] <ckardaris> and could skip recipients if already specified somehow
[14:52:13] <gahr> that makes sense
[14:52:46] <ckardaris> somehow being compose-to-sender, command line arguments, or soon IPC ;)
[14:53:52] <flatcap> morning all
[14:53:59] <ckardaris> hello flatcap
[14:54:04] <flatcap> hi ckardaris 
[14:54:44] <ckardaris> so, if we would like to do it dirty, we could add an additional conditional to my patch checking the fast_reply setting.
[14:55:31] <ckardaris> But maybe there is a better place to change all that. Your codebase experience would help regarding that
[14:56:40] <ckardaris> But what I have understood this past days is that there are many dirty patches applied on top of the original and this has created some confusion
[14:58:22] <flatcap> hehe, yes.  lots of dirty patches applied over a poorly-understood workflow 
[14:58:52] <ckardaris> It is a really interesting task to try and simplify all that. 
[15:01:02] <flatcap> not long back, Kevin (upstream maintainer) improved the docs: https://neomutt.org/guide/gettingstarted.html#sending
[15:01:17] <flatcap> that made things a bit clearer
[15:03:44] <flatcap> and this details where the hooks fit in: https://neomutt.org/guide/advancedusage.html#compose-flow
[15:05:37] <ckardaris> yes, there are many things to consider
[15:07:05] <ckardaris> I started seeing all of that trying to handle mailto links in IPC implementation. There are so many places you can change and achieve the same result that it makes you think what would be the best/most elegant one to choose
[15:09:16] <flatcap> indeed
[15:11:46] <ckardaris> For example, my patch does the change at the last possible part of the flow. But gahr showed me that there are other places before that where settings affect the same behavior. So we should probably change things there.

[17:33:46] <gahr> flatcap: I have a prototype for the overhaul of the atoi family of functions. Unfortunately, nothing works anymore :D
[17:34:59] <flatcap> hehe, perfect
[17:35:05] <flatcap> let's see
[17:46:52] <gahr> do you want to see the branch nonetheless?
[17:46:57] <gahr> yeah I can push a draft
[17:47:39] <gahr> https://github.com/neomutt/neomutt/tree/devel/strto
[17:48:33] <gahr> I'm uncertain of the _full suffix
[17:48:43] * flatcap looks ...
[17:51:16] <gahr> I also need to fix the tests as they expect different values
[17:51:22] <gahr> results..
[17:51:46] * flatcap pre-processes mutt/string2.h
[17:52:09] <gahr> I can expand them if you prefer
[17:52:12] <gahr> I just wanted a quick approach
[17:53:19] <flatcap> ah, there are only 7.  I was worried that there would be more atoi functions than callers :-)
[17:53:37] <gahr> :)
[17:55:10] <gahr> and the variants in string.c are implemented in terms of the base case
[17:55:18] <flatcap> yes
[17:57:03] <gahr> what are your thoughts? Should I make it into a real thing?
[17:58:39] <flatcap> still reading...

[18:06:27] <gahr> thanks - ok I'll make it work
[18:06:39] <flatcap> great
[18:07:39] <flatcap> as the functions have no deps, it's tempting to split them out into mutt/atox.[ch] (or some variant)
[18:17:14] *** Joins: rgrinberg (~textual@200.5.63.76)
[18:20:20] <gahr> sure I can do that 
[18:31:53] <gahr> I think I got it all wrong :)
[18:32:10] <gahr> the current functions return 0 on success, 1 on trailing data, and < 0 on failure
[18:32:10] <flatcap> oh dear
[18:32:25] <gahr> I changed all < 0 checks with !..full()
[18:32:40] <gahr> basically, almost nobody checks for traling data
[18:32:49] <flatcap> ah
[18:33:10] <gahr> there's just one call in menu that does
[18:33:10] <gahr> if ((mutt_str_atoi(buf, &n) == 0) && (n > 0) && (n < (menu->max + 1)))
[18:33:18] <gahr> so it check that the whole line was consumed
[18:34:01] <gahr> and a few checks for != 0
[18:34:05] <gahr> ok let me do that again :)

[20:11:24] <ckardaris> hey guys, is the history of this chat saved anywhere?
[20:13:44] <flatcap> no, but I've got logs.  looking for anything in particular?
[20:14:58] <ckardaris> Not really. I am just moving a lot between home and work (use the same laptop currently) and I am missing some discussions. No worries
[20:15:43] <ckardaris> I will probably start using an old laptop I have and save the chats there. hehe
[20:15:57] <flatcap> ah, ok
[20:16:46] <flatcap> some people have suggested a logging service, but I quite like my mistakes being forgotten about :-)
