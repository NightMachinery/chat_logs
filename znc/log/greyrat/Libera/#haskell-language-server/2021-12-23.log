[15:11:55] <wz1000> jneira[m]: why do we need a stack.yaml for 9.2.1?
[15:12:16] <wz1000> As far as I can tell, nobody who develops HLS uses stack.yamls
[15:12:28] <jneira[m]> ailrun does
[15:12:47] <jneira[m]> and sm recently ;-)
[15:13:04] <jneira[m]> no one active in the branch afaics
[15:13:12] <wz1000> yes, but the 9.2.1 branch is still in a very rough state
[15:13:35] <jneira[m]> but well it has to be added sooner or later, so it is a draft
[15:14:12] <jneira[m]> it is not checked in ci yet so it will not interfere with the work
[15:14:14] <wz1000> are the people using the stack.yamls using multiple ghc versions with stack regularly?
[15:14:45] <wz1000> Because 1 version should be good enough for development, and it adds a lot of overhead
[15:15:17] <wz1000> Especially given that HLS works with both stack and cabal projects regardless of how you compile it
[15:15:17] <jneira[m]> the install script needs the stack.yaml to work, even if it is empty
[15:16:26] <jneira[m]> the idea was help maintainers and contributors using stack or advanced users wanted to install hls from source using stack
[15:17:29] <jneira[m]> so make lower barriers for them
[15:18:42] <jneira[m]> the install script is about to be deprecated but the alternative, `ghcup compile hls` requires cabal
[15:19:52] <wz1000> I'm not sure what the benefit of allowing users to pick their build tool for installation purposes is.
[15:20:02] <wz1000> Every project has its own requirements
[15:20:05] <wz1000> GHC needs hadrian
[15:20:21] <jneira[m]> but hadrian can use stack, no? ;-)
[15:20:37] <wz1000> other projects use make or cmake or bazel or whatever
[15:20:51] <wz1000> You can use stack to build hadrian, yes
[15:21:01] <wz1000> But you can probably use stack to build cabal-install as well
[15:21:25] <wz1000> I don't see the point of offering a choice in that regard
[15:21:35] <jneira[m]> so ghc can be built with cabal or stack, like hls, and that need ghc team work i suppose
[15:21:44] <jneira[m]> s/need/needs/
[15:22:35] <wz1000> GHC only has 1 stack.yaml in its tree, and its updated twice a year
[15:23:40] <wz1000> ghc is always built with hadrian or make
[15:24:04] <wz1000> hadrian can be built using cabal or stack or neither, using a bootstrap script
[15:24:52] <wz1000> similarly, if you want to build HLS, you build with cabal or the one stack.yaml that we keep for development purposes
[15:25:05] <wz1000> and you can build cabal using stack if you want :)
[15:26:41] <wz1000> GHC also maintains only 1 stack.yaml for a single version of GHC
[15:27:09] <wz1000> and hadrian has way fewer dependencies than HLS, so it is not very hard to maintain
[15:27:38] <wz1000> If you build HLS with cabal, you can still use the resulting binaries on stack projects

[15:32:05] <jneira[m]> well, while there are maintainers keeping those stack.yaml up to date and helping contributors to update them it doesnt have to be a blocker
[15:32:33] <jneira[m]> hls and ghc are different precisely cause hls is highly tied to ghc
[15:33:01] <jneira[m]> and we have 3 cabal.project now
[15:34:35] <jneira[m]> but the idea is if you make easier for possible stack contributors work on hls, we will got more chances to get those contributions

[15:41:08] <jneira[m]> idk, maybe we should open an issue about stack.yamls current and future status, to reflect all povs and get more feedback, we already have discussed the topic in the past here (with fendor_ and sm recently)
