[00:07:42] <ZacharyIkpefua[m> Hi everyone, my name is Zachary and I am a graduate student at Clemson University. I'm in a class where we have the option to contribute to open source projects and I saw this one and was interested about it (mainly because its in C) I was wondering how much information I will need in order to contribute for one of the "good first issue" labels? Thanks!

[01:19:32] <ddickstein[m]> Before I try to create a hacky workaround, does anyone have a good way to tell from a function invoked from an Insert mode mapping via <Cmd> (so we are still in Insert mode) whether the cursor is inserting into column 1 or into column 2? In both cases vim seems to think I'm "in column 1"
[01:22:43] <ddickstein[m]> Zachary Ikpefua: I'm not sure what the recommended way to get in touch with core maintainers is for contributing, but there are many who are active on this chat who can help give you pointers. Contributing.md suggests looking for low-complexity issues: https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Acomplexity%3Alow
[01:22:56] <ddickstein[m]> * CONTRIBUTING.md
[01:27:59] <ZacharyIkpefua[m> Thanks
[01:28:41] <clason[m]> I think the first step is to use Neovim yourself for a week or so; get familiar with it, see what the things are that you'd fix to make your life better.

[04:06:34] <ii14[m]> <Rishab[m]> "is there a way command line..." <- wdym? you just start nvim from a terminal
[04:08:21] <Rishab[m]> ii14[m]: i want to use `:terminal` mode in nvim but to do this i need to open nvim and them enter the `:terminal` command. I want to start in `:terminal` mode by default when I start nvim. Then I can set up my terminal emulator to run nvim on startup so nvim becomes my default terminal
[04:09:24] <ii14[m]> you should be able to just put `terminal` in your init.vim, but I don't know how it will behave when you open nvim on a file
[04:09:58] <Rishab[m]> hmm i see
[04:11:40] <ii14[m]> I guess you can check `argv() == []`
[04:12:15] <ii14[m]> if argv() == []
[04:12:15] <ii14[m]>   terminal
[04:12:15] <ii14[m]> endif
[04:14:01] <ii14[m]> or `v:argv[1:] == []`
[04:14:58] <ii14[m]> the first one checks just for opened files, and the second will also check for any command line options
[04:15:29] <ii14[m]> so if you start `nvim -R` the test will return false
[04:15:31] <ii14[m]> for example

[14:19:21] <Zevv>    <F1>        * :bprev<CR>                                                                                                                                                            
[14:22:44] <sunjonSenghanBri> and the same for <esc> ?
[14:23:03] <Zevv> No mapping found
[14:23:34] <Zevv> nice, eh
[14:23:56] <sunjonSenghanBri> and you're accidentally hitting escape? or hitting it to leave insert mode?
[14:24:36] <Zevv> insert mode or not does not matter
[14:24:51] <Zevv> I can hard reproduce this by hitting escape and f1 in rapid succession
[14:24:58] <Zevv> typically mistyping with my pinky
[14:25:07] <Zevv> if I use two fingers I can just repro 100% of the times
[14:25:32] <sunjonSenghanBri> what about `:<C-v><F1>` ?
[14:25:40] <sunjonSenghanBri> on the command line
[14:25:59] <sunjonSenghanBri> does that give you a regular <f1> back?
[14:26:32] <Zevv> oooh  wait a sec

[15:10:51] <mi6x3m> hey, does anyone know why a highlight group i define in .init.vim is cleared when the editor starts?
[15:10:55] <mi6x3m> it's there but it's cleared
[15:11:29] <ii14[m]> your colorscheme overwrote it
[15:11:40] <ii14[m]> check `:verb hi YourHlGroup`

[15:12:26] <ii14[m]> put it in `~/.config/nvim/after/plugin/color.vim` or something like that
[15:12:49] <ii14[m]> or on ColorScheme event
[15:13:27] <ii14[m]> if you want to change the colorscheme after initialization
[15:13:51] <mi6x3m> ii14[m], my colorscheme overrides EVERY group i define?
[15:14:10] <ii14[m]> depends on the colorscheme

[15:21:55] <ii14[m]> vim-plug doesn't call colorscheme for you
[15:22:16] <ii14[m]> maybe the plugin does, which would be a bad practice for a plugin to do
[15:22:24] <mi6x3m> ah, yeah its true lol i found the call
[15:22:28] <mi6x3m> very long vim file sorry
[15:23:33] <kaffeesurrogat[m> hello everybody, i'm new to the group. I did my first steps in webdevelopement today. I've spent some time to configure neovim using coc with a couple of extensions. They work very well. If i mix up some languages within a *.html type of file using <script></script> tags, coc sticks with working in "html" mode. Thus autocompletion/snippets of js are not listed any longer. Is there a way that coc/neovim can recognize that i'm typing
[15:23:33] <kaffeesurrogat[m> some js/php ... within a file of *.html-ending ? Many thanks in advance .... 
[15:25:42] <ii14[m]> I don't know, but if you're just learning webdev you shouldn't need any of that
[15:26:19] <sunjonSenghanBri> bfredl:matrix.org: https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/12925 could be kind of solved with vim.ui stuff, if statusline components could be clickable
[15:26:46] <sunjonSenghanBri> I can't find the issue where you commented that the code already exists for tabline, just isn't plumbed in

[19:25:43] <imanthoc[m]> Hi, this is the first time I ever try to contribute to open source
[19:25:43] <imanthoc[m]> I would like to ask a question if anyone is able to help
[19:26:17] <sunjonSenghanBri> 42
[19:26:31] <sunjonSenghanBri> I mean, sure - just ask your question!
[19:26:47] <sunjonSenghanBri> (but I'm quite sure the answer is 42)
[19:26:56] <imanthoc[m]> unfortunately I wasn't asking about the ultimate question about life the universe and anything related
[19:26:59] <imanthoc[m]> anyways
[19:27:27] <imanthoc[m]> If I want to implement X feature asked in say Issue 1234
[19:27:27] <imanthoc[m]> Do I just have to mention the issue number in the pull request?
[19:27:46] <imanthoc[m]> Or do I have to get myself assigned to it somehow?
[19:28:29] <clason[m]> Just go for it an link the issue (in general; some issues are... special).
[19:28:30] <sunjonSenghanBri> you're free to take on whatever you wish, if you deem it within your capabilities
[19:28:45] *** Quits: Maxattax (~max@50-195-160-193-static.hfc.comcastbusiness.net) (Quit: WeeChat 3.3)
[19:28:49] <imanthoc[m]> Ok that's  good
[19:28:51] <clason[m]> If there is an actual issue you are interested in, you could mention that instead to get a more specific answer.
[19:28:51] <imanthoc[m]> thanks a lot
[19:29:10] <imanthoc[m]> well not any particular
[19:29:30] <imanthoc[m]> say a generic feature "Add this to that"
[19:29:41] <clason[m]> that's... very generic
[19:30:04] <imanthoc[m]> say this one " https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/17160 "

[19:30:10] <imanthoc[m]> I was looking at before
[19:30:44] <sunjonSenghanBri> I'd take an issue that there's been some discussion on
[19:30:44] <clason[m]> If you're new to the codebase (and hopefully have used neovim a bit yourself), a good strategy is always to comment on the issue saying "I'd like to work on it; any pointers or objections?"
[19:30:59] <clason[m]> You can also ask here or on #neovim-dev:matrix.org 
[19:31:36] <clason[m]> In this case, it's tricky since it touches part of the codebase shared with Vim, so ideally this would be coordinated.
[19:32:14] <imanthoc[m]> As is said I should probably go for a low complexity issue first?
[19:32:29] <clason[m]> Yes, or anything involving the Lua code
[19:32:42] <clason[m]> (which is fairly recent and much more readable)
[19:33:44] <clason[m]> another strategy is to look at old, stalled PRs (not due to technical issues) and ask whether you can continue them since you want to start contributing
[19:33:44] <imanthoc[m]> tbh I am fairly experienced in C but have never ever touched lua

[19:34:07] <bolgrov[m]> In my case, I often get 3 **warning** errors in a line which generally occult any **error** diagnostic in that line.
[19:34:17] <imanthoc[m]> anyways I will try and do my best
[19:34:17] <imanthoc[m]> Thanks for your time
[19:34:25] <bolgrov[m]>  * Is there any way to specify the order of _line_ diagnostics from LSP ?
[19:34:25] <bolgrov[m]> In my case, I often get, for example, 3 **warning** errors in a line which generally occult any **error** diagnostic in that line.
[19:34:26] <clason[m]> so it's the codebase that is the issue, not the language
[19:34:46] <clason[m]> but, yeah, then "start with Lua" is not as much as a no-brainer as in general
[19:35:02] <sunjonSenghanBri> imanthoc:matrix.org: are you a vim user prior to setting out to contribute to opensource?
[19:35:37] <d1rewolf> installing vimwiki via this readme (https://github.com/vimwiki/vimwiki/blob/master/README.md). It states to run :Helptags and :h vimwiki after install to verify success. I get an error with :Helptags, but :helptags is a valid command..but it indicates an argument is required. :h vimwiki works.
[19:35:44] <imanthoc[m]> yes I use vim practically for anything 
[19:35:47] <d1rewolf> is :Helptags a typo?
[19:36:09] <sunjonSenghanBri> imanthoc:matrix.org: awesome. Best of luck with your first PR :]

[23:34:32] <lilgopher>  nnoremap <silent> <leader>su viw~ works but  let g:lmap.s.u = ['viw~', 'toggle upper/lower case'] doesnt
[23:34:45] <d1rewolf> irc_user: I thought the same, but I don't see the keys for navigating links in help files mentioned there
[23:34:52] <irc_user> lilgopher: I don't know about that plugin, but making a word uppercase or lowercase in vim is already fast `viwU` `viwu`
[23:35:15] <irc_user> oh maybe you're doing something else
[23:35:33] <irc_user> d1rewolf: The help is opened in a vim split, it uses the same hotkeys as normal vim no?
[23:35:33] <lilgopher> yeah irc_user I use viw~ to toggle between them, but apparently the plugin expects a command instead of a sequence of letters
[23:35:35] <d1rewolf> irc_user: never mind. I needed to scroll further

[23:36:15] <d1rewolf> was looking for ctrl+] and ctrl+O
[23:36:20] <irc_user> oh 
[23:36:32] <lilgopher> I just dont use viw~ enough to remember it and I use that plugin as "menu to display useful commands"

[23:39:06] <irc_user> Well if you understand it conceptually you don't have to remember much at all, if you use vim `v` gets used all the time, `iw` does too, and `~` just flips case. But regarding your actual question, you could try writing `'norm viw~'` there, that might work.
[23:39:37] <irc_user> But I'm not familiar with the plugin so I'm not sure if that's the best way of doing it.
[23:40:25] <lilgopher> wow, that worked irc_user:  let g:lmap.s.u = ['norm viw~', 'toggle upper/lower case']
[23:40:28] <lilgopher> thank you
[23:40:32] <irc_user> No problem :)
[23:40:46] <lilgopher> but you are right I use viw all the time so eventually I will remember u and U and ~
[23:41:18] <lilgopher> the plugin is useful for new users as a cheatsheet I guess, not sure if there is other plugin more popular for that
[23:41:41] <irc_user> Haha yeah, when I first found `~` I thought it was stupid, but now I might use it a couple times a day if I'm coding. Not a game changer but still fun to press the right key when the moment arises.
[23:42:22] <lilgopher> yeah, I convert full words to uppercase in sql queries sometimes and I just discovered viw~
[23:43:39] <irc_user> Wish I could recommend plugins but my vimrc has recently become pluginless XD. You could ask questions in #vim too, which is a tad more lively.
