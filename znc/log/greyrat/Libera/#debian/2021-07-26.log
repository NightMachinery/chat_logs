[00:05:15] <jhutchins> If you wanted to clean it up, and the packages aren't available individually, you could copy the firmware files you need, un-install the meta-packaegs, then copy the firmware back to the correct directory.  Wouldn't be managed for upgrades, but the firmware files are fairly stable.
[00:07:57] <Khepra> or git clone from kernel.org . updates are actually going on every few weeks

[00:45:59] <Khepra> thing is, rolling your own requires a bit of knowledge and experience in building custom kernels. the "dead easy" part was about .deb packaging, there's a Makefile target that directly builds into deb.    "bindeb-pkg"  for example. the Makefile has more info on it

[00:49:35] <PMT> 5.10 would be a more convenient thing to try, at least. I'm not sure about more useful.
[00:49:50] <useretail> currently my debian runs fine on 4.19
[00:49:54] <useretail> also
[00:50:00] <Khepra> well it's regularly packaged, apt install away, and no need to fiddle with custom rolled kernels
[00:50:00] <useretail> All users of the 4.19 kernel series must upgrade.
[00:50:10] <useretail> as stated here: https://lwn.net/Articles/863650/
[00:50:47] <Khepra> that's probably about the two recent security vulns, but debian backported those

[00:51:57] <PMT> gregkh does appear to believe that it is his duty to secretly increase the percentage of patches that go into stable releases until you're actually running the latest kernel

[00:56:49] <srv> ubuntu is better than debian
[00:56:53] <amacater> Hobz - undervolting is more a hardware thing than a software thing ... is shis so that you can squeeze more performance out of a CPU? If so, this is not the right list

[03:51:22] <Khepra> penguing gods help you if mdadm cron decides to scrupt at the same time btrfs cron does :)
[03:51:27] <Khepra> *scrub
[03:52:05] <Khepra> ho kay I'm typoing like a minkey in typewriter factory. time for bed.
[03:52:13] <sney> btrfs still doesn't have reliable built-in raid5 right? what would the solution be for someone with a raid5-ish disk layout who wanted btrfs features? aside from the zfs-shaped elephant in the room, anyway 
[03:52:38] <Khepra> raid5 with raid1c3 metadata
[03:52:49] <PMT> My understanding is that the claim is currently that parity raid on btrfs is acceptable if you don't use it for the metadata. I have not experimentally tested this or examined the implementation.
[03:53:03] <sney> ah, so there is a way to do it. TIL
[03:53:36] <Khepra> meanwhile, there's an ongoing discussion on the mailing lists about abandoning the "raid" terminology because btrfs implementation of redundancy and striping is not like typical "RAID" setups would assume it
[03:54:01] <PMT> call it braid ;)
[03:54:18] <PMT> pollute the namespace further. wcpgw

[03:54:35] <Khepra> PMT: hey, that was my recommendation in response to raidz :)))
[03:54:49] <PMT> Khepra: i mean, "raidb" would follow from that
[03:55:09] <Khepra> ye but it needn't be literally teh same, right? braid is a nice pun too :)
[03:55:10] <PMT> braid might be too similar to draid though
[03:55:15] *** Quits: Tokamak (~Tokamak@107.117.203.210) (Ping timeout: 258 seconds)
[03:55:23] <Khepra> "oh well"
[03:55:39] <PMT> araid, braid, etc.
[03:55:51] <PMT> get the metroid crowd, call it kraid ;)
[03:56:16] <Khepra> actually no "raid" at all. current recommendation is RSP designation. Rn.Sn.Pn. Replica N, Stripe size N, Parity N
[03:56:34] <sney> catchy
[03:56:40] <PMT> Sure, I assumed that was the current plan, I just predict lots of people saying "yeah it's basically X"
[03:56:53] <Khepra> because you can have different profiles for data and metadata, for different levels of replication, stripe size and parities, this actually lends quite well
[03:57:43] <Khepra> PMT: except it isn't. expectations of, say RAID 10 are not the same for btrfs. yes theres, say, R2, S2, P0. but it does not guarante two disk failure tolerance because thre's no guaranteed mirror group designations
[03:58:24] <Khepra> with classic RAID you have two disks that are striping among themselves, and then two other that are replicaas of first two. you can have any one of them fail. and then another may fail as long as it is not in the same mirror group.  this doesn't apply to btrfs raid10.
[04:00:02] <Khepra> the benefit however is you can use differently sized disks and rebalance entire profiles on the fly, because of how btrfs allocates blocks among the disks.  just another kind of pros vs cons.
[04:00:42] <PMT> Khepra: I understand it isn't. I am saying that I predict people still doing it.
[04:00:58] <sney> so you'll probably still have to choose a simple umbrella term like "braid" so that the distinction between it and other multi-disk redundancy systems is clear 
[04:01:09] <Khepra> well... people will keep thinking kernel upgrade will fix their totally misconfigured storage layer :)))
[04:01:12] *** Joins: squatch (~squatch@50.39.204.59)
[04:01:40] <sney> and about 5 minutes after "braid" is chosen, half-paying-attention technicians around the world will start calling it "braids" 
[04:01:44] <sney> still, it'll be googleable.
[04:02:07] <Khepra> ikr! it lends so well!

[05:43:19] <sney> I'm not aware of apt-get or aptitude supporting local files, but maybe that's decided by libapt rather than the individual tool

[14:22:28] <Khepra> useretail: at first, I'd say you'd have to build the DKMS module for the new kernel. question is, why is a dkms module mentioned during apt installation of the kernel you built? can you give full example of commands you ran here?
[14:22:31] *** navis` is now known as navis
[14:22:49] <PMT> Khepra: installing kernels triggers dkms builds.
[14:23:15] <Khepra> ah that's right. 
[14:23:55] <Khepra> I'm guessing missing headers? install the custom-built kernel's _headers_ .deb first?
[14:23:58] <useretail> Khepra, just make deb-pkg
[14:24:13] <useretail> i installed kernel headers first
[14:24:18] <Khepra> useretail: consider using bindeb-pkg in the future unless you also want a deb-src package

[14:25:45] <useretail> ok, it's installed what should i do now? what implications this may have? should i uninstall it?
[14:26:03] <Khepra> useretail: then my second guess that the aufs source needs to be adjusted for .198 source code changes, that's... sometimes a problem with out of tree sources

[14:27:30] <Khepra> well that just installed the kernel into /boot and (presumably) triggered initramfs rebuild and grub config. however if it failed at dkms stage, those two additional stages might not've been run. you can do:

[14:28:44] <Khepra> 2) re-run     update-initramfs -u -k all;    3) then re-run    update-grub;      but first you might need to rebuild the dkms if it's needed inside the initramfs;    1) dpkg-reconfigure aufs-dkms
[14:29:06] *** Joins: fossdd (~fossdd@sourcehut/user/fossdd)
[14:29:25] <Khepra> if 1) fails again, then you have a problem. if you need aufs in initramfs, you have double problem and should not reboot until that's fixed, or else you might end up with an unbootable system

[14:32:54] <Khepra> so this also seems like an issue worthy of a report in debian bug tracker. once the kernel regularly bumpst to .198 or newer with the next point release, aufs-dkms might cease to be installable unless it's pached; if my assumption about patches-needed is correct
[14:33:32] <Khepra> useretail: yeah that's a broken DKMS module that did not install for the new kernel. if you reboot into the new kernel, this module will not load.
[14:34:02] <useretail> but do i really need it?
[14:34:12] <PMT> Are you using it?
[14:34:16] <Khepra> pretty sure DKMS did not install itself, so only YOU Can answer that :)
[14:34:18] <useretail> probably not
[14:34:37] <useretail> maybe it was installed as dependency
[14:35:05] <Khepra> useretail: apt remove -s aufs-dkms  (as non-root)  and see what else falls out
[14:35:37] <Khepra> or apt-cache rdpends --instaled aufs-dkms, but   removal simulation (above) is easier to read.

[14:44:09] <useretail> If it is not possible to install the aufs-dkms package on Raspbian buster then it's simply not possible to install the official docker-ce package from docker.com [1] because aufs-dkms is a dependency of the docker-ce package
[14:44:16] <useretail> from here: https://github.com/raspberrypi/linux/issues/3021
[14:44:58] <Khepra> hence the bug report I mentioned. it's not a problem _now_ but when regular buster kernel bumps to .198 and above, it might become a patch-needed issue.
[14:45:31] <Khepra> the upstream, however, no longer supports 4.19, and there's a reason aufs is not in mainline, so that's somethign worth considering for teh future of the package in debian
[14:46:26] <Khepra> also on debian, docker.io does not have aufs-dkms as dependency. 
[14:47:40] <useretail> then maybe suggestion?
[14:47:48] <useretail> also found this: https://github.com/sfjro/aufs4-standalone/tree/aufs4.19.63+
[14:48:39] <Khepra> aufs is not part of mainline for a reason. imho any use and isntallation of it is highly experimental and "there be dragons", as is the case demonstrated here.

[16:56:45] <zerowalker_w> but minor ones are wanted as they contain fixes,or do i have the wrong impression?
[16:57:02] <Khepra> zerowalker_w: it wont do that because major version is embedded in package name. so postgresql-10, for example, remains 10.x.y forever
[16:57:44] <Khepra> but the problem with unattended upgrade of postgres is primarily in restart vs reload requirements and need to orchestrate with application requiring socket reopening, transactions aborted due to that etc...
[16:57:57] <Khepra> unlesss that's a toy system where pffft who cares if your app breaks mid-request :)
[16:59:26] <Khepra> in general, unattended upgrades is something I loudly advise against, for serious server use. it does only half the job, and brings in a lot of breakage potential, as is witnessed in this channel every two or so months when someoe walks in with a problem caused by unattended upgrade.

[17:00:53] <zerowalker_w> Khepra, ah, while i can get away with the restart/reload mostly as it's my own developed application generally that uses postgresql, you being strongly against it makes me reconsider as it seems it's not as good of an idea as i thought
[17:02:07] <Khepra> zerowalker_w: if anything, it does only half the job. it won't cause service restarts when libraries upgrade, and most certainly wont reboot your system for kernel and glibc updates.
[17:02:29] <Khepra> it's ... configurable with some other packages, but all that just lends even more into "breakage potential". 
[17:02:46] <zerowalker_w> to get where i am coming from, i generally don't go into the servers to check for updates etc, and i am a windows person but stated using linux some years back for servers (really love it) but the "updates" are quite different it seems so i am not too sure how to approach it
[17:03:27] <zerowalker_w> wait what happens if it upgrades something a service uses then? will it use the old one until it restarts, or will it just break
[17:04:12] <Khepra> zerowalker_w: I'd recommend apticron. you get emailed with pending upgrades and you can review the changelogs in your test environemnt, and plan an upgrade + orchestration;    but if that's a dev server where all of this would be overkill, sure go ahead, use it, just keep in mind all this.
[17:04:33] <amacater> zerowalker: it will normally use the old one until it restarts ... apt-listchanges (I think) is the package that explains what has been updated at any one point
[17:05:32] <Khepra> one exception to this are services/situations that spawn new subprocesses fromt heir own, now upgraded and potentially incompatible files. this is, for example, one common factor in unattended upgrade breakage with libraries.
[17:07:01] <zerowalker_w> Khepra, that might be something, if it needs manual intervention then the next-best thing is to know when to do it. There's quite some servers though which are probably more or less identical, is there some approach to "bulk upgrade"?

[17:07:43] <Khepra> zerowalker_w: automation
[17:08:35] <Khepra> for example, I disable debian's annoying function fo (re)starting services on upgrade/installation, and I use automation like ansible or saltstack to orchestrate upgrades, esp for postgres as relevant web applications would break the request on postgres socket going away mid-transaction
[17:08:40] <zerowalker_w> Khepra, ah yeah like, i think php does this, spawn processes here and there, so it could mean process 1 has php7.0.1 and process 2 has php7.0.2 (in a nutshell)?

[17:09:05] *** aqua is now known as kish`
[17:09:21] <Khepra> yes. exactly PHP is one example as by default with fpm, and actually depending on your configuration, processes die after a while of not being used and are respaned (from the filesystem that may've changed, but master didn't!) on next request
[17:09:23] <zerowalker_w> Khepra, debian's annoying function for starting services... ?
[17:09:54] <Khepra> zerowalker_w: yes. on debian, by default, package upgrades/instllation with services will cause those services to start or restart
[17:10:17] <amacater> khepra: It may be annoying - but it is, at least very consistent and asks you whether to restart or not. It's a fail-safe approach
[17:10:38] <Khepra> no I don't mean that where on OS upgrade it asks whether to ask or just restart services.
[17:10:43] <Khepra> I mean on regular apt use
[17:11:22] <zerowalker_w> Khepra, ah, so like if you upgrade postgresql it will restart said service, and you mean you might not want that, you might just want the new version to load at a alter time?
[17:11:23] <Khepra> for example with postgresql, the mere act of  `apt upgrade` is postgresql server package is upgarded, it'll cause service restart automatically. problem is you don't control _when_ it happens exactly and cannot orchestrate with other services
[17:11:29] <amacater> Regular apt use - it still asks, I think.
[17:11:32] <Khepra> this explains the policy in question:  https://people.debian.org/~hmh/invokerc.d-policyrc.d-specification.txt
[17:11:47] <Khepra> amacater: it never asks for service (re)starts
[17:12:21] <Khepra> it asks for confirmation to do the entire installation/upgrade job in most cases, but that's something else

[20:25:01] <jhutchins> Khepra: i guess you are left to time the upgrade, with the knowledge that it will restart.
[20:26:07] <jhutchins> Khepra: A LOT of servers will maintain connections on restart.  Some offere a graceful restart, and that's generally what a package upgrade will do.  It stops accepting inbound requests, waits until the last request/session is fulfilled, then restarts.
[20:27:53] <Khepra> nginx has that ability but it does not do that by default. postgres doesn't. mariadb doesn't. afaik apache doesn't. uwsgi doesn't. postfix doesn't. dovecot doesn't... none of the services I use on the servers do that automatically.

[20:28:13] <Khepra> and other than nginx none of these servers can do the graceful in-place master daemon upgrade without nuking open sockets.
[20:29:07] <Khepra> and timing update is useless. upgrades will generally have different packages in total unless you somehow isolate to upgrading only one by one, which is pointless. and completion time depends on server load anyhoo
[20:30:53] <Khepra> simply put: the only way to orchestrate your service is to.... orchestrate the services and disable debian's automagic.

[20:50:20] <jhutchins> Khepra: It's the nature of some services.  Some maintain a session/connection even if they're idle.

[20:52:12] <Khepra> jhutchins: if it is, it's not the nature of any service that I use :)   but also, there's difference in what you're describing and what eg. nginx's graceful restart does.
[20:52:52] <Khepra> it's one thing to finish current requests and then close the conn with no error state to the client; and quite anoterh to hold accept() until your process is upgraded
[20:53:11] <Khepra> without the latter, new requests coming in are rejected, so it's not a graceful restart.
[20:53:39] <Khepra> nginx can hold the socket, hold off accept()'ing new ones until the mastre daemon switcheroo and then proceed as if nothing happened. not a single request is dropped.

[20:58:00] <Khepra> upstream. keeps growing active connections even though the tcp stack long forgotten them. there's been a _number_ of such bugs over the past few years and it looks like with version in buster, the patches aren't fixing that completely

[21:45:59] <jelly> i was thinking more a certain gnome and systemd dependency, restarting which makes things like "systemctl" not work any more
[21:46:11] <Khepra> oh :)
[21:48:53] <jelly> postgres server-side state is probably 1-2 orders more complex than haproxy's; and having two instances running in parallel might basically double your RAM and other requirements
[21:48:59] <Khepra> PHP has advantage here in that each request is essentially a completely isolated state. so even if you break it mid-transaction, on next request, the php process will just reconnect to the db, even with pooled db conns
[21:49:32] <jelly> maybe you could write a proxy for Pg if you needed that
[21:49:38] <Khepra> but web applications written in other languages like python, their request processors are just single functions called inside the spawned process, and most frameworks don't reconn on each "request"
[21:50:21] <Khepra> jelly: actually I solved that at our application level. the WSGI handler is signalled and then it holds new requests in a loop until it's signalled to release them downt he wsgi app stack. perfect graceful behavior.

[22:02:12] <tharkun> Good day, I recently found a jessie instalation due to the fact that the sysadmin migrated to a different company. All daemons running are recent versions due to her diligent work but as I am way more lazy I plan on upgrading to a more recent version of Debian. What is the path I must travel to do so. My goal is to reach Debian stable at the end.
[22:03:08] <PMT> I suppose that depends on what you mean by recent versions and how she got there.
[22:03:10] <greycat> one release at a time.
[22:04:45] <sney> jessie->stretch followed by stretch->buster *might* not be too bad, but depending on what the machine is hosting, you might end up rebuilding the service anyway; it might be smarter to do a new separate install of buster (or bullseye) and migrate 
[22:05:28] <tharkun> Ok, jessie->stretch->buster. Any caveats that I might encounter? (Changelogs are on tonight's reading list)
[22:07:07] <PMT> The release notes are relevant, but if you're running software not from the repos, you probably should uninstall it before upgrading and then install whatever's in the repos (or, if you must, versions from elsewhere) after the upgrading is all done.
[22:07:21] <sney> again, it really depends on what you're hosting. if it's just postfix or nagios or something, it'll probably be smooth and take less than an hour. if php is involved, you might pull your hair out. 
[22:07:44] <Khepra> question: what does "all daemons running are recent versions" really mean and will that cause problems for step-wise upgrade.
[22:08:22] <Khepra> ie. is that server running latest-latest from respective upstream deb repos. or is it a mix-in from sid.

[22:10:30] <tharkun> sney: Thanks, from the logs, I can see that it is mostly debian packages installed and compiled from buster. I believed she did simple backports to the production version. No php on this instance :)
[22:10:54] *** Joins: fossdd (~fossdd@sourcehut/user/fossdd)
[22:11:22] <sney> I would be cautious then, because if the former admin was willing to spend the extra time backporting buster packages rather than upgrading to buster, there may be a reason
[22:11:34] <sney> some legacy crustware that blows up with a newer libc, libssl, etc? 
[22:13:10] <tharkun> sney: Thanks, note written and phone call scheduled.
