[14:56:46] <OnkelTem> Hi all. If I have to use two "but"s in a sentence, how can I replace one of them?
[14:57:05] <OnkelTem> or rather - which what can I replace it?
[14:58:02] <OnkelTem> Like in: "I do want it, but not now, but tomorrow"
[14:59:00] <twb> OnkelTem: "I do want it; not now, but tomorrow"
[14:59:19] <twb> OnkelTem: "I do want it, but not now; tomorrow"
[14:59:19] <OnkelTem> thanks twb 
[14:59:40] <OnkelTem> That sounds a little different though to my Russian ear
[15:00:44] <OnkelTem> Because in Russian they are two different phrases. Of course they mean, but with a difference
[15:00:51] <OnkelTem> the mean the same*
[15:02:29] <OnkelTem> "but" can be transleted to Russin in two ways: either "но" (strictly =but) or "а" (used exactly in this context, when you have to but-s basically)
[15:04:11] <OnkelTem> I still hope I can say precisely that in English! 
[15:04:24] <OnkelTem> 1) I want it, but not now. 
[15:04:55] <OnkelTem> 2) I want it, but not now, <word> tomorrow!
[15:05:38] <OnkelTem> and <word> in Russian would exactly the "а" conjunction
[15:05:57] <OnkelTem> would be*

[15:39:32] <twb> rindolf: I give zero shits about your movie stuff
[15:40:17] <twb> kurahaupo_: I like "rather than", it feels more natural / informal than my earlier versions
[15:41:08] <twb> "Alice wanted a pet, but a bilby rather than a cat."
[15:41:11] <OnkelTem> kurahaupo_: yep thanks!
[15:41:59] <rindolf> twb: ;( don't be mean
[15:42:02] <twb> Note "rather, A" means yes to A; "rather than A" means no to A.  I didn't express that very clearly; I hope it makes senes.
[15:43:37] <OnkelTem> "I want it, but not just yet. Rather tomorrow."
[15:43:48] <OnkelTem> or.. "rather, tomorrow"
[15:44:15] <twb> That makes sense
[15:44:57] <twb> I think the structure you described just isn't common/natural in English
[15:45:12] <twb> So while it makes sense that feels a little formal
[15:46:07] <twb> I think in casual speech someone would say "I want it, but not now... maybe tomorrow?" or "... I want it tomorrow"
[15:46:17] <bememory> twb can u explain sensable and sensative? they re not clear to me  
[15:46:34] <twb> bememory: do you mean "sensible" and "sensitive" ?
[15:46:46] <bememory> ya typo
[15:47:10] <twb> bememory: "sensible" is as in "common sense", i.e. a rational, reasonable behaviour
[15:47:47] <twb> For example, it is sensible to eat a mix of fruit, vegetables, pulses, and grasses (cereal).  It is silly to eat ONLY chocolate.
[15:47:56] <bememory> they seem different between spoken language and writings 
[15:48:22] <twb> "sensitive" is as in "the senses" – touch, smell, proprioception, &c
[15:49:09] <bememory> twb then which one is close to the allergy ?
[15:49:15] <twb> For example if you have good night vision, but are blinded by bright light, you are "sensitive to light"
[15:49:28] <twb> bememory: of the two, definitely the second one
[15:49:54] <twb> "sensitive" can also be used by extension to refer to empathy, i.e. "sensitive to the moods/feelings/needs" of another person
[15:50:15] <twb> Or "sensitive" in the sense of easily hurt by cruel words
[15:50:47] <twb> Like if there are two fat people and you say "hey, fatty!" and one of them cries and the other one say "I don't care what you think", the first one is "sensitive"
[15:51:48] <bememory> which one is highly used in america english for speaking？
