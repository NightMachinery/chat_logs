[00:42:17] <Intelo> cbreak no. to give you context, here is what I believe:
[00:42:27] <cbreak> also: don't lose power during bios updates. Sometimes there are ways to recover from such an incident, but sometimes there aren't.
[00:42:29] <Intelo> My OS is bloated. I remember I changed hardware (the whole pc) but used the same sdd that had ubuntu installed in it. I guess xorg and drivers of hardware might have been causing the freezing and crashing and slow speed.
[00:42:51] <cbreak> that has nothing to do with bloat.

[00:43:01] <jhutchins> Intelo: If you think your system is bloated (due to packages YOU installed), review each installed package and the reason it's installed, and remove it if it doesn't meet your needs.

[02:59:00] <intelo> btw, I read that asus has ASUS CrashFree BIOS 3
[02:59:11] <intelo> that means my bios can't get crashed
[02:59:12] <intelo> ?
[02:59:23] <oerheks> yes, you can reverse a borked update
[02:59:25] <intelo> I mean, is it a norm in modern MBs
[02:59:29] <intelo> oh ok
[02:59:31] <intelo> great!
[02:59:38] <oerheks> it has space for more than one update
[02:59:53] <intelo> whats the next step do you advise to make the system rock solid as possible oerheks ?
[03:00:09] <oerheks> test it now?
[03:00:13] <intelo> oerheks btw, I updated via internet the first time. It didn't do the latest. then I did via usb
[03:00:21] <oerheks> not sure you need any tweaks with ryzen
[03:00:24] <intelo> oerheks same test? youtube? 50 tabs?
[03:00:53] <intelo> tweeks? just that my ram showed 2600MHz and I did it 3200 manually in bios
[03:00:55] <intelo> nothing else
[03:00:57] <intelo> I guess.
[03:01:05] <cbreak> that sounds dumb.
[03:01:31] <intelo> cbreak the bios part?
[03:01:33] <intelo> don't know..
[03:01:38] <cbreak> overclocking is one if the many things you shouldn't do when you want stability
[03:01:43] <cbreak> because it'll for sure not help with that at all
[03:01:49] <intelo> My ram is 3200
[03:02:07] <cbreak> if you want stability, then you get proper ram
[03:02:21] <cbreak> not those shitty non-ecc gamer modules
[03:03:21] <intelo> https://youtu.be/q2P16lLq1yE?t=107
[03:03:36] <intelo> cbreak my ram "is" 3200 actually
[03:03:45] <oerheks> indeed, not all mobo's overclocking works well with linux
[03:04:01] <cbreak> intelo: it claims it
[03:04:03] <intelo> its not overclock. the speed normal is 32k
[03:04:05] <cbreak> but it's still overclocking

[03:05:12] <intelo> isn't this not really 3200MHz? Crucial Ballistix BL8G32C16U4B 8GB 3200MHz
[03:05:22] <intelo> I have slighly different one but same thing
[03:05:44] *** OurRoyalGabe_ is now known as OurRoyalGabe
[03:05:45] <cbreak> there's a reason normal memory profiles don't go to that frequency: Because it's out of spec
[03:06:03] <cbreak> the manufacturers can claim that frequency works, and maybe they even tested it for those modules
[03:06:03] <intelo> so this is overclockign? not real speed?
[03:06:10] <cbreak> obviously it's overclocking
[03:06:15] <intelo> right.
[03:06:20] <cbreak> but that doesn't mean that it will work in all systems
[03:06:23] <intelo> what is the normal speed?
[03:06:36] <cbreak> because the overclocked frequency has to work along all the involved hardware
[03:06:39] <intelo> so should I keep it 2600 in bios or 3200?
[03:06:51] <cbreak> the ram, the memory controller, the wires / traces along the path, ...
[03:07:11] <cbreak> your choice. Do you care about stability or ram frequency?
[03:07:25] <cbreak> do you have stability problems?
[03:07:38] <intelo> stability
[03:07:39] <cbreak> like random crashes or freezes?

[03:08:19] <cbreak> even if only to see if that improves your issues.
[03:08:23] <intelo> ok, I should put it on "auto" option? that results in 2600MHz
[03:08:29] <intelo> ok.
[03:08:49] <intelo> oerheks cbreak coming to software part. How can I further optimize? where to start?

[18:56:36] <S4nt1m> This is my takeaway from the post: If you log in in graphical mode on an X display manager (xdm, gdm, kdm, wdm, lightdm, …), traditionally, what is executed after you log in is some scripts in /etc/X11 then ~/.xsession.

[21:08:12] <Mitacho> I think this " lowlatency " is because I tried another command from the internet ( sudo apt-get install linux-lowlatency-hwe-20.04 ).
[21:08:29] <Minus_One> Okay. I am also on 5.13, and looking at the quirks.c file for that kernel relase, the JBL Quantum family quirks are not present. But the Kingston HyperX Cloud Flight S is, and it uses the same quirk. So you can try making the right hand of the mapping 095116ea
