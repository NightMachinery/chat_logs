[02:29:04] <sd> 11<H​otmess> yeah thats why it gets dangrous
[02:29:11] <sd> 11<H​otmess> and you have to take into account wireing

[06:01:04] <xe0n> the thing with those store baked things is they're cheap LOL
[06:02:10] <mjt> Coles cookies are objectively superior
[06:02:16] <mjt> Although in general Woolworths is better
[06:02:18] <xe0n> i dont eat that shit often so meh
[06:02:37] <xe0n> i use the rewards at woolies so i get the $10 off at bws
[06:02:38] <xe0n> LOL
[06:02:47] <mjt> coles makes me keep a fkn piece of paper to get a fuel discount
[06:02:58] <xe0n> fly buys?
[06:03:09] <xe0n> i just scan my watch at ampol\caltex for 4c thing
[06:03:13] <mjt> you can't store it on the card like woolies
[06:03:19] <xe0n> laaammmeee
[06:03:19] <mjt> yeah I do that 
[06:03:48] <mjt> 1990s calling they want their shitty system back 
[06:05:16] <mjt> of course Richard Stallman would say we shouldn't use loyalty cards as we are being exploited

[06:06:06] <yuken> Because they're drier than a desert.
[06:06:07] <csws> he's right
[06:06:15] <csws> I don't have any loyalty cards
[06:06:16] <yuken> and I have no tools to help solder this shit, like helping hands.
[06:06:26] <csws> I don't even do the RAC thing when fueling up

[06:14:45] <csws> yeah the car can do that
[06:14:47] <csws> just don't like the concept
[06:14:52] <csws> and my music isn't on the phone anyway
[06:14:53] <xe0n> you dont need audiophile quality in a car
[06:15:08] <csws> the lag!
[06:15:11] <xe0n> LAG?!

[06:15:28] <xe0n> wtf
[06:15:32] <csws> i've got tonnes of old spindles
[06:15:39] <xe0n> i dont even look at my phone when im driving

[06:16:10] <TurkeyGibby> Or, better yet, use a service that streams it!
[06:16:12] <csws> anyway I'll get there
[06:16:15] <xe0n> +++
[06:16:17] <csws> god no
[06:16:26] <TurkeyGibby> Plex is free
[06:16:35] <mistiry> noy for mobile
[06:16:36] <TurkeyGibby> You can host all of your pirated material
[06:16:37] <mistiry> not*
[06:16:40] <csws> why waste the bandwidth when I have MP3s?
[06:16:45] <TurkeyGibby> ...
[06:16:50] <mistiry> gotta have plex pass for the mobile app
[06:16:54] <TurkeyGibby> You're an idiot
[06:16:59] <xe0n> confirmed.
[06:17:00] <csws> what?
[06:17:04] <mistiry> is your bandwidth metered?
[06:17:06] <csws> like streaming it on the go
[06:17:08] <csws> now using 4G
[06:17:12] <csws> my mobile bandwidth is yes
[06:17:19] <csws> raping my phone battery now
[06:17:21] <csws> or I could just burn to CD
[06:17:26] <csws> when I get off my ass and do it
[06:17:30] <xe0n> LOL! plug into the power in your car
[06:17:32] <csws> and then I get it in full audiofool grade quality
[06:17:34] <TurkeyGibby> imagine burning CDs in 2021
[06:17:44] <mistiry> i mean, my mobile bandidth is limited too, but music doesnt take THAT much
[06:17:50] <xe0n> yeah because mp3s sound better than the AAC used in spotify

[06:17:56] <csws> also half of this shit is like FLACs
[06:18:05] <TurkeyGibby> Better get the binder full of disks out
[06:18:06] <mistiry> doesnt matter when you burn it to mp3

[06:18:21] <TurkeyGibby> Makes sense
[06:18:24] <csws> ???
[06:18:41] <csws> TurkeyGibby: I get the option from bandcamp for mp3 320 and flac.. what one am I going to pick lol
[06:18:57] <JollyRgrs> wow, mp3 CD player? I had one of those in my 1988 oldsmobile ninety-eight... back in like 2001?
[06:18:59] <csws> mp3 v0 would be preferable but apparently some older players don't like variable bitrate
[06:19:07] <xe0n> <csws> won't be able to tell with shitty car speakers anyway
[06:19:20] <csws> uh yeah
[06:19:29] <JollyRgrs> are you doing mp3 CDs or just burning mp3s to CD?
[06:19:30] <csws> but I have headphones at home so
[06:19:38] <csws> though I can't tell the difference between mp3 320 and flac, it sounds the same
[06:19:46] <xe0n> LOL!
[06:19:58] <csws> but I'm not a poor person and have TBs of storage so I keep flacs anyway

[06:20:23] <csws> JollyRgrs: burning mp3s to CD
[06:20:27] <csws> dude
[06:20:30] <csws> wish the car supported SD
[06:20:33] <csws> but it seems that's only for the maps
[06:20:38] <JollyRgrs> so use like subsonic (or the non-non-free forks of it) and stream whatever
[06:20:43] <JollyRgrs> why are you burning mp3s to CD?
[06:20:48] <JollyRgrs> 70 minutes per disc dude
[06:20:59] <csws> would a car stereo support it the other way?
[06:21:04] <JollyRgrs> I just tossed out my 100+ CD binders I used to keep in my car
[06:21:11] <JollyRgrs> depends on the car stereo?
[06:21:11] <csws> wow
[06:21:20] <csws> idk I don't listen to that much music
[06:21:22] <JollyRgrs> i think it was like 240 CDs or something per binder
[06:21:26] <JollyRgrs> you suck
[06:21:29] <csws> I'd just put together a few CDs, fill the stacker and that's it
[06:21:33] <yuken> csws, no.
[06:21:41] <JollyRgrs> fill the stacker? you got like a 10 disc changer in the trunk? lol
[06:21:46] <csws> yuken++
[06:21:52] <csws> I think it does 6 discs?
[06:21:59] <JollyRgrs> what are you driving? 1999 caddy?
[06:22:08] <csws> no a 2012 subaru ._.
[06:22:13] <TurkeyGibby> Honestly I listen to such a wide variety of music that a couple of disks would be awful
[06:22:16] <yuken> csws, I'm trying to solder with literally nothing but an iron and my hands.
[06:22:17] <JollyRgrs> OEM headunit?
[06:22:21] <csws> yeah
[06:22:24] <yuken> No helping hands, no pliers taped down to a desk, no vise.
[06:22:25] <JollyRgrs> weird
[06:22:29] <yuken> And I'm about to just burn evreything.
[06:22:35] <xe0n> no shit
[06:22:44] <xe0n> maybe you should get the equipment to do it right yuken?
[06:22:45] <JollyRgrs> but yeah, just use your phone
[06:22:49] <csws> yuken: put the PCB in your mouth
[06:22:54] <csws> then solder that way
[06:22:56] <csws> problem solved
[06:23:07] <JollyRgrs> csws: yuken could solder a new board to your head unit to help you out
[06:23:14] <yuken> I can't solder for shit.
[06:23:17] <yuken> I can't even tin my wires.
[06:23:25] <csws> idk man I'm pretty happy with listening to the same shit
[06:23:33] <xe0n> this chat is sponsored by PCBWay! For great prototype PCBs, go to PCBWay! They can also do silkscreen and fit your components if you cbf
[06:23:42] <Hunterkll> <yuken> Hunterkll, solder joints literally fell off.
[06:23:44] <Hunterkll> LOL
[06:23:52] <yuken> yes. dry, shitty joints that fell off.
[06:24:04] <csws> shoulda used lead smh
[06:24:08] <csws> ROHS is a scam
[06:24:10] <yuken> it is leaded solder.
[06:24:14] <csws> use more lead!
[06:24:15] <Hunterkll> Hit hgard and fast
[06:24:22] <Hunterkll> hard
[06:24:27] <csws> or maybe flux idk
[06:24:31] <yuken> I can't even keep the wire in the same spot on the ICs/PCBs, Hunterkll 
[06:24:34] <TurkeyGibby> eat the lead
[06:24:34] <yuken> because they move around.
[06:24:38] <yuken> Because I don't have anything to jkeep them in place.
[06:24:43] <csws> one time I made a serial 3.5mm jack for a storsimple
[06:24:49] <csws> was the worst soldering job in the universe. the ground was floating
[06:24:51] <csws> but hey it worked
[06:24:56] <Hunterkll> hard
[06:25:02] <Hunterkll> and fast
[06:25:37] <Hunterkll> yuken: melt solder on the wire first
[06:25:57] <yuken> Hunterkll, ... I'm aware.
[06:25:58] <yuken> I can't do that.
[06:26:07] <xe0n> is this for your vape?
[06:26:31] <yuken> yes. the electronics are all sound, I just can't solder for shit, and do not have any of the tools to help.
[06:26:32] <Hunterkll> if you can't do that
[06:26:37] <yuken> And the joints will most likely cause a fire.
[06:26:40] <xe0n> LOL just buy a fucking vape
[06:26:45] <yuken> ... fuck off.
[06:26:45] <Hunterkll> youre an idiot
[06:26:47] <Hunterkll> just
[06:26:51] <Hunterkll> fuck off
[06:27:01] <yuken> I'm under the legal age to purchase such an item, xe0n.
[06:27:30] <Hunterkll> do i have to literallly
[06:27:33] <Hunterkll> oh god
[06:27:59] <Hunterkll> yuken: i'll teach you how to solder
[06:28:07] <yuken> Won't work unless you'er in-person.
[06:28:27] <yuken> Hunterkll, I know how to tin a wire. I don't have the ability to do so without tools like helping hands.
[06:28:32] <yuken> I have a soldering iron and a tabl.
[06:28:33] <yuken> table.
[06:28:38] <Hunterkll> yuken: in person live stream
[06:28:47] <yuken> I do not have a camera or tripod or etc to use.
[06:28:51] <yuken> Nor do I have 3-4 arms.
[06:28:58] <Hunterkll> no i mean i will
[06:29:03] <csws> they don't sell helping hands to 20 year olds?
[06:29:12] <csws> lol
[06:29:29] <csws> tbh
[06:29:56] <csws> hold the thing yo'ure soldering with the left hand, iron with the right, then hold the wire in your mouth?
[06:30:02] <csws> I mean might as well who cares at this point if you swallow lead
[06:30:08] <yuken> ... that will burn me to hell.
[06:30:10] <Hunterkll> god
[06:30:15] <csws> wtf how short is your wire?
[06:30:16] <Hunterkll> i can teach this easy 
[06:30:20] <yuken> very, very short csws?
[06:30:27] <yuken> Like, lengths here are a few cm at most.
[06:30:29] <csws> you didn't buy a big ass spool of it?
[06:30:32] <csws> wtf
[06:30:36] <csws> I got like metres of the shit
[06:30:40] <yuken> no, I have a big spool.
[06:30:44] <yuken> The length between items to solder with wires.
[06:30:50] <xe0n> why dont you buy equipment so you can solder properly...
[06:30:56] <xe0n> instead of trying to macgyver shit
[06:31:07] <yuken> Costs more money, xe0n.
[06:31:08] <csws> this sounds like a disaster

[07:42:06] <fritzwastaken> oh it wasnt them
[07:42:11] <fritzwastaken> I went up and fucked em up verbally
[07:42:22] <fritzwastaken> Sounds like they are fucking wood working up there
[07:42:27] <fritzwastaken> constant hammering etc
[07:42:36] <fritzwastaken> then another neighbor came out and seconded my complaints
[07:42:50] <fritzwastaken> So we got to yell at the mother while she was trying to defend them
[07:43:35] <fritzwastaken> the 2 boys sleep in the master, the daughter and her gf stay in the little bedroom, and the big fat mamma sleeps on the couch
[07:43:53] <fritzwastaken> and the 2 boys are loud as fuuck from 10pm until about 5 am
[07:44:12] <fritzwastaken> I went to set the bed up for us to go to sleep and heard them doing whatever noise making they do
[07:44:33] <fritzwastaken> Started yelling at them and the neighbor came out and was like "Yea, fuck you guys"
[07:44:56] <fritzwastaken> You all are loud as shit, drop shit on purpose and are just hammering or pounding on shit for fun
[07:45:13] <fritzwastaken> Mom told them all to go away, and neighbor and I discussed how fucked up that family way
[07:45:15] <fritzwastaken> was*

[07:46:58] <fritzwastaken> oh yea

[07:47:23] <fritzwastaken> I need some fucking sleep
[07:48:10] <fritzwastaken> If I dont get it tonight I will just stand there at their front door ringing their door bell at 6 am
[07:48:25] <fritzwastaken> Poor fat ass momma gunna have to get up off the couch
[07:48:48] <fritzwastaken> I may do it at 3 am if I hear it again
[07:49:11] <fritzwastaken> the complaint to the leasing office is already put in for both me and my neighbor who hates them
[07:49:52] <fritzwastaken> DOnt get me wrong, I love weed, but their entire fucking apartment reeks of it as soon as the door opens
[07:49:56] <fritzwastaken> they are children
[07:50:15] <cryptic1> no sleep for you

[07:51:19] <fritzwastaken> her last 3 partners were chicks and a trans chickl before that
[07:52:06] <fritzwastaken> i just hate shitting where I eat. I dont like starting fights where I live
[07:52:33] <fritzwastaken> but at the end of the day, I already sleep super lightly, I need everything I can get
[07:52:56] <fritzwastaken> and my anxiety aint doing great right now with this
[07:53:04] <fritzwastaken> but luckily I had a bunch of ARLO stickers
[07:53:20] <fritzwastaken> so now all my windows have a sticker saying "You might not see ARLO, but it sees you"

[09:24:29] <Memer> We have morning, afternoon, and evening as greetings
[09:24:30] <csws> tbh I keep the TV off the network too
[09:24:40] <Memer> It feels like we should have something for the time period between late night and very early morning
[09:24:53] <Memer> since "evening" feels kind of... off after 11 PM
[09:25:12] <csws> it doesn't exist because you should be in bed
[09:25:13] <xe0n> there are excuses, it costs more to add to the device

[11:51:14] <Memer> I agree that it's necessary while looking at new statistics and all
[11:51:20] <DrZak> less infection - it can go easier
[11:51:26] <Memer> But I just wish our local health agency wasn't so absolutely garbage at communicating
[11:51:55] <DrZak> yea, its just the 2nd year this is happening, givt agents are used to such a rapid pace
[11:53:06] <Memer> I was talking with someone and they basically said "if it needs to go on for 5 more years and have boosters every few months then fine"

[11:53:59] <DrZak> i read an article where they recounted epidemics from the past and said there's certain chance the virus will kill itself in 2-3 years from random mutation making itself faulty
[11:54:11] <DrZak> but there are absolutely no certainties in this
[11:54:28] <DrZak> and this hsould've been somehow made understood to the idiots
[11:54:33] <Memer> I just realistically wonder how many times we can extend and re-instate vaccines and boosters and mandates
[11:54:48] <DrZak> :)
[11:54:50] <Memer> before public cooperation dips to the point where it's worse than if we just let it happen
[11:55:19] <Memer> Realistically I'd say "I give it until 2022 tops"
[11:55:29] <Memer> s/2022/2023
[11:55:31] <layer8> Memer meant: "Realistically I'd say "I give it until 2023 tops""
[11:55:32] <DrZak> i grant that the vaccines right now arent as 'safe' as the stuff we get normally, like typhus, hepatitis, etc., but it'll get better i imagine very soon
[11:55:52] <DrZak> so, then there wont be anything weird getting flu and covid vaccines each autumn
[11:55:55] <DrZak> ideally in one shot
[11:55:59] <Memer> Yeah - but consider that this is far closer to the flu shot
[11:56:05] <Memer> and not that many people actually get the flu shot
[11:56:18] <DrZak> and masks? hmm, there are tons of professions working heavily in maskks 6-8 hrs aday..
[11:56:53] <Memer> I just know that public cooperation is mandatory for this to work
[11:56:54] <DrZak> most fuckers who complain about it most vocally are scum who doesnt work at all :D
[11:57:19] <DrZak> (otherwise they would've little time and energy to go about and complain loudly)
[11:57:37] <Memer> And given the responses we had when we said this was rolling into late 2021, I can't imagine the responses if we didn't loosen up by 2023
[11:57:45] <DrZak> hmm
[11:57:59] <DrZak> on the other hand, perhaps with enough anti-vaxxers croaking it will start to sink in
[11:58:02] <DrZak> :)
[11:58:19] <Memer> The death toll is so insanely low (comparatively) now
[11:58:33] <Memer> That the opposite is more likely IMO
[12:00:23] <DrZak> is it?
[12:00:35] <DrZak> hmm, i guess it not as bad as the first winter around
[12:00:47] <Memer> Comparatively to the original huge spikes
[12:01:15] <DrZak> though the long term effect are still there, all those creeps landing in hospitals end up with a couple years/even decade of their life expectancy shorn off
[12:01:23] <Memer> Absolutely
[12:01:32] <Memer> The problem I run into is very simple.
[12:01:50] <Memer> After my initial kneejerk reaction of "oh FFS, really" wore off

[12:03:09] <Memer> We're less likely to get holdouts to commit
[12:04:08] <Memer> By the time COVID Booster 4/5 comes around, people are going to be hard-set in their decisions, and each booster after, community participation will fall
[12:04:39] <Memer> (Also, making these vaccines free permanently is not going to be economically sustainable unless we reallocate our budget)
[12:06:13] <Memer> In a perfect world everyone would get their vaccine, get up to date on the boosters, and we'd all be able to go home. But I just feel it's necessary to consider what the plan *actually* is at this point, because evidently we haven't fixed anything

[12:29:57] <SirSceptalot> hi Activ8 
[12:30:10] <Memer> Is it universal that telecom actually gets a budget and PC parts don't?
[12:30:28] <Activ8> morning SirSceptalot
[12:30:55] <Memer> Also, mornin' Activ8
[12:31:29] <Activ8> Memer morning.  The budget  doesn't mean much if you need parts you need parts
[12:32:08] <Memer> Fair enough. I just had a weird experience with a previous company, where telecom was able to more or less abandon old several hundred dollar Jabra headsets in a move...
[12:32:24] <Memer> but I couldnt get one singular monitor after requesting one several months prior
[12:32:32] <Memer> (Not a dual-monitor setup, literally one monitor)
[12:33:15] <Memer> and this was a pretty universal issue from what my colleagues at the time mentioned
[12:33:34] <Memer> Was kinda just curious if budgeting typically is that off
[12:34:04] <sd> 06<N​injaStyle> Seems like a thing with whatever leadership you got
[12:34:23] <Activ8> that might have been a project of some sort
[12:34:37] <Activ8> so the money might have already been allocated
[12:35:15] <Memer> That's most likely
[12:35:29] <Memer> When I think about it that way, that makes more sense
[12:36:13] <Activ8> usually there is budgets depends on the org, however when projects are concerned the money is already allocated and not a budget
[12:36:25] <Activ8> there may be plans for an IT budget of some sort soon
[12:36:42] <sd> 06<N​injaStyle> I feel like typically these types of problems are c levels who aren’t aware or don’t care about your role in the company and how that is important to the success of the business. Usually that’s an issue of lack of advocacy or just shitty mgmt
[12:37:38] <Activ8> certain things don't need a budget.  Did they deny a monitor order? In the grand scheme of things is it totally important that you get a change of monitor for your job to function
[12:39:56] <Memer> It was one of those things where they just put out a Forms document for it, then never actually did anything with the results

[13:03:42] <Memer> Calls just sit in queue if the one agent suddenly has food poisoning
[13:03:45] <Activ8> 4 calls in 10 mins is fine but the customer would never want to be on hold for 45 mins
[13:04:02] <sd> 06<N​injaStyle> Call center stuff is miserable
[13:04:08] <Activ8> if I am ever in a queue more than 2 mins I hang up
[13:04:17] <Memer> That's why i think two agents is *mandatory*
[13:04:17] <sd> 06<C​omputer man, fix my pants!> just remember, all the money they saved from squeezing you went to the guys at the top
[13:04:44] <Activ8> well in theory that would be 4 calls in 25 mins, which is still bad lol
[13:04:45] <Memer> Unless it's a company that can afford to have a day with nobody working IT
[13:04:55] <sd> 06<C​omputer man, fix my pants!> the guys who couldn't even look up some stats on how many calls were coming in
[13:05:19] <Activ8> we have a notification on the phones to ask if the customer can email our service desk email address if your wait time is more than a certain amount of time
[13:05:36] <Activ8> that cuts the queue by a lot and when they email our service desk the ticket gets generated automatically
[13:05:49] <Activ8> cutting our time a lot as well as we don't have to log the ticket 
[13:06:00] *** Joins: Leonarbro (~Leonet@user/leonarbro)
[13:06:06] <Memer> You know, what would really help is if more organizations started adopting "chat support"
[13:06:44] <Activ8> we have chat support as well but I can't be on the phone and chat support and ticket system at the same time
[13:06:58] <Memer> I honestly find that it's faster when you (don't) have the user on the phone half the time
[13:06:59] <Activ8> we have to turn it off sometimes and redirect them to sending emails to the ticket system
[13:07:14] <Activ8> with chat systems you can multi task better
[13:07:18] <Activ8> you can't multi task on a phone call
[13:07:19] <Memer> Because there seems to be this magical force in some companies
[13:07:30] <Memer> where the moment IT answers, "oh hold on a second" *6 minute hold*

[13:07:51] <Activ8> big helldesk?
[13:07:58] <Memer> I've spent 2.8 years in helpdesk roles lol
[13:07:59] <Activ8> we have a service desk yes so we can track tickets

[13:08:35] <Memer> And would much prefer to at least be a T2
[13:08:37] <Activ8> I do voip, 0365 and general desktop support
[13:08:46] <Memer> ew voip
[13:08:52] <Activ8> it's not so bad
[13:09:03] <Memer> Oh, actual support is probably not so bad
[13:09:08] <Activ8> I get paid for watching TV though
[13:09:18] <Memer> Just the "my call quality is low" 
[13:09:19] <Activ8> it's 100% wfh no office based, we have a team that goes out on field
[13:09:25] <Memer> "Shows here your ping is 723"
[13:09:31] <Memer> "My ISP said my internet is faaaaaaaaaast"
[13:09:32] <Activ8> we don't get that problem
[13:09:35] <Activ8> never have
[13:10:08] <Memer> One of my old roommates was helpdesk as well
[13:10:26] <Memer> We both got that one a lot
[13:10:33] <Activ8> I do service desk as well like allocate tickets to our field engineers but that's not much
[13:10:36] <Memer> Primarily after WFH
[13:10:56] <Activ8> I have a headset so I'm not static all the time
[13:11:08] <Activ8> I can go make a cuppa n still be on a call lol
[13:11:18] <Memer> I did that often enough
[13:11:33] <Memer> Just had to make sure I didn't cross my roommates path while we were both on a call
[13:11:40] <Memer> Different companies and whatnot
[13:11:42] <lancehead> "Yes hello, how can I help you toda--" [COFFEE GRINDER NOISES]
[13:12:06] <Memer> I still remember when I was on a call and our third roommate decided it was blender time
[13:12:18] <SirSceptalot> lol, I've had multiple chats with people like that since covid
[13:12:24] <Activ8> lol our customers swear in jest 
[13:12:28] <Memer> and I kinda just had to sit there and mentally go :/
[13:12:31] <Activ8> it's a pretty nit together company
[13:12:33] <SirSceptalot> still better than the sounds of children murdering each other
[13:12:44] <Activ8> I had that yesterday lol
[13:12:44] <fritzwastaken> Man... my upstairs neighbors are a lot quieter after I went up there, yelled at them, cursed out their kids, and put in a formal complaint...
[13:12:48] <sd> 06<N​injaStyle> Yeah I hear kids a lot on my calls
[13:12:55] <Memer> I hear kids quite often too
[13:12:59] <Memer> well used to*
[13:12:59] <lancehead> SirSceptalot: reminds me of college from home, we had people wake n baking in bed, on camera, because they were forced to have a webcam on
[13:13:05] <sd> 06<N​injaStyle> Especially with India
[13:13:25] <Memer> I got kinda lucky with college this year
[13:13:41] <sd> 06<N​injaStyle> Sex?
[13:13:43] <lancehead> I will never forget my teacher trying to not comment on my classmate taking a fat bong rip in the middle of English class 
[13:13:53] <Memer> Originally my professor wanted people to do webcams on, but for some reason my camera just refused to apply background adjustments
[13:14:06] <Memer> They let me not use mine as a result because I didn't want people just staring at my room
[13:14:12] <fritzwastaken> lancehead: I work for a california based company now, its just standard practice
[13:14:21] <lancehead> I was the only exception to the rule because my girlfriend sleeps behind me @Memer
[13:14:25] <Memer> (and then the class dropped to 3 people attending)
[13:14:54] <lancehead> I just told them "I don't want 20 IT students staring at my sleeping girlfriend" and they backed off lol 
[13:15:13] <SirSceptalot> lol, "don't mind me guys, gf is just doing some onlyfans recordings" - lancehead, to his prof. and class, probably
[13:15:34] <Memer> I kinda have a "this is unnecessary but ok" response to companies mandating cameras on during meetings
[13:15:45] <sd> 06<N​injaStyle> I would never
[13:15:48] <Memer> but with college my response is basically "I'm paying YOU lmao"
[13:15:56] <lancehead> Well, not that, but we may have used me not having a webcam to our advantage a few times... @SirSceptalot 
[13:16:02] <lancehead> >_> 
[13:16:04] <Memer> I seriously don't get it
[13:16:31] <Memer> like... as someone who's paying for the class it does not make sense that people would be (mandated) to use cameras
[13:17:17] <Memer> I guess the powerplay is to just angle the camera at your face and sleep on your desk until they stop making you turn it on though, if they reaaaaally want to simulate the class environment
[13:17:27] <sd> 06<N​injaStyle> You can’t make me be on camera
[13:17:36] <sd> 06<N​injaStyle> I’d just say I’m driving or something
[13:17:41] <lancehead> I have had times where I slept through classes while logged in on my phone @ Memer lol 
[13:17:46] <lancehead> Just set alarms for the end of class 
[13:17:54] <lancehead> And slept in 2.5h increments 
[13:17:57] <Memer> hahaha
[13:18:34] <Memer> The one thing that's really nice about these classes is that it's making the concept of recording lecture more commonplace
[13:18:48] <sd> 06<N​injaStyle> Why not tbh
[13:19:04] <Memer> And I find it's often entirely reasonable to speed 1.5 classes
[13:19:06] <sd> 06<N​injaStyle> Like you’re already on a call just push the button
[13:19:29] <Memer> Yep
[13:19:47] <Memer> Plus if you missed something or don't remember a concept
[13:19:50] <Memer> you can just... go find it

[19:16:51] <SirSceptalot> why is that?
[19:17:14] <SirSceptalot> I'm about as NOT relgious as they come, but I enjoy "celebrating christmas"
[19:17:36] <SirSceptalot> it has nothing to do with the religious junk behind it, it's just a good time with family/friends
[19:17:38] <rpifan> well there is so many more interesting things you coudl be doing with your life, i mean how about celebrating chinese new years in asian instead
[19:17:44] <rpifan> of the jewish holidays in israel
[19:17:46] <SirSceptalot> although it helps to have good friends/family :)
[19:17:47] <dragonfleas> rpifan, I don't mind an excuse to eat a bunch of food tbh

[20:14:11] <vinrock> if its federal, yes

[20:18:53] <yuken> SirSceptalot, in the US, yes. I was wondering about outside of the country.
[20:18:57] <yuken> Which appears to be a "yes".
[20:18:57] <SirSceptalot> even in mechico?
[20:19:11] <vinrock> outside the country isnt, but depends on what your being asked and why
[20:19:22] <yuken> SirSceptalot, I'm applying for special items that require deep background checks and such, and special licenses.
[20:19:28] <SirSceptalot> ah, ok

[23:56:45] <yuken> Hunterkll, I was looking at prices for full-auto AR-15 lowers, and they're fucking insane.
[23:56:48] <yuken> $31,000 minimum.
[23:56:48] <Hunterkll> an STG-44
[23:56:49] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> Colt Defence is still very much a thing
[23:56:55] <Hunterkll> yuken: and they're also not AR-15s 
[23:56:56] <Hunterkll> lol
[23:56:58] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> They just don't make anything you or I can get
[23:57:08] <shibboleth> yuken, a full-auto ar15 would be an m4
[23:57:18] <Hunterkll> or an M-16 ...
[23:57:20] <yuken> Hunterkll, it's an AR-15 receiver that someone drilled a third hole into.
[23:57:29] <shibboleth> well, the m16 is huuuuger
[23:57:30] <Hunterkll> lul
[23:57:37] <Hunterkll> registered tho?

[23:57:42] <shibboleth> also, didn't fare to well in 'nam
[23:57:42] <yuken> well duh, pre-1986 lol.
[23:57:49] <Hunterkll> like those fake SAWs
[23:57:57] <Hunterkll> that have mac-10 serial numbers transferred to them
[23:58:01] <Hunterkll> illegal as fuck but people still sell them
