[02:56:30] <mdogg> When he said "hollandaise sauce" he did add something to the 'h' sound which I have heard when people speak languages like Arabic or Farsi.  I don't think he *really* pronounces "hollandaise" that way normally.  I think he was just trying to make a point about the 'h' sound which is sometimes absent depending on the word and in which country the person resides who is pronouncing it.  
[03:01:08] <LimeOn> That could be a J instead of G
[03:10:31] <CuriosTiger> The one I hear -- both from Arabic and Spanish speakers -- is a laryngeal sound almost like an r
[03:10:42] <CuriosTiger> so it becomes something like hrollandaise
[03:11:24] <CuriosTiger> According to Wikipedia, it's a voiceless velar fricative.

[09:09:03] <TimMc> Some of them would be synonyms within a certain context. For example, for the metaphorical meaning of "defeated thoroughly", you could say that one sports team obliterated/destroyed another team. But you wouldn't use pulverized (probably) and definitely not exterminated.

[09:14:41] <spinningCat> through is also noun
[09:14:44] <TimMc> Throughput is the amount that gets "put through" something.
[09:14:53] <TimMc> through is a preposition
[09:15:06] <spinningCat> well throughput is used as "overall" i guess
[09:15:40] <TimMc> OK, I guess "through" has meanings as a noun and adjective as well.
[09:15:51] <TimMc> But I usually see it in its prepositional use.
[09:16:23] <spinningCat> so added to the verb?
[09:16:48] <TimMc> No, those are adverbs.
[09:17:16] <TimMc> (Adverbs are weird and can go in a lot of places.)
[09:17:58] <TimMc> Prepositions describe a relationship: *In* the house, *at* the lake, *through* the door.
[09:18:08] <spinningCat> well i think German language is strict about placing adv, verb, noun in the spesific plane of word
[09:19:38] <spinningCat> oh

[15:20:36] <amigojapan> bullgard4: bitcoin mining is a complicated process which people do to get compensated for, it ends up doing the transactions needed without the need for a central server to do it.

[15:24:18] <amigojapan> bullgard4: the total number of bitcoins is limited, but at the beginning they made them even more limited so they would be more rare, the mining process also will unlock new bitcoins until bitcoin reaches the top limit

[15:44:05] <amigojapan> Here in Japan they made the retirement age 60 and the age to recieve pension 65, so people need to figure out a way to survive 5 years without salary

[15:50:19] <brigand> What does it mean to "join welfare"?
[15:51:46] <amigojapan> brigand: the welfare system is part of the safety nets Japan and other countries have against becoming totally broke. They give you a salary per month and pay your rent

[15:52:44] <mihael> is the welfare given until you die?

[15:54:13] <mihael> is there a chatroom like this for the language?
[15:54:52] <amigojapan> mihael: it can. I think it depends on what your situation is. I know someone in his 40s that works and his salary from work gets taken. And instead he gets the monthly amount. He has some illnesses which only let him work part time

[15:56:11] <amigojapan> mihael: the school I work for also gives Skype lessons for Japanese if you are really serious
[15:57:05] <mihael> Wow! that would be really helpful. How does one enroll to that skype lessons?
[15:57:06] <amigojapan> From a native speaker that can speak English
[15:57:55] <amigojapan> mihael: if you are interested. Give me your Skype name or email. And I will get you in touch with them
[15:58:38] <brigand> amigojapan: We have a welfare system here. But here you "join" it as soon as your start to earn money, even earlier when you're studying for example. After re-reading I think I know what you mean though.
[15:58:42] <mihael> thank you!

[15:59:56] <mihael> welfare here can't even afford you your basic necessities

[16:09:12] <ntwk> The word "expropriate" is a transitive verb roughly meaning "to take (property) away from (someone)".  Since this is transitive, when one performs expropriation are they expropriating the person or the property?  Or are either uses acceptable?

[16:11:26] <ntwk> "The government expropriated the owners of their homes" vs. "The government expropriated the homes".
[16:12:44] <CuriosTiger> The target of an expropriation is property.
[16:12:55] <CuriosTiger> So "The government expropriated the homes."

[17:01:41] <CuriosTiger> whence itself is largely archaic at this point. I can't even quite figure out what "likewhence" would mean.
[17:02:13] <CuriosTiger> "whence" means "from where", so "from the same place" or something?
[17:07:15] <Flonk> I was thinking "in the same place" but maybe "whence" wouldn't be the correct term then. As in, "I met Meredith at the mall, and Jeff likewhence"
[17:08:42] <Flonk> Maybe not the best example, I just used it in a technical document: "`AzureWebJobsStorage` is a connection string for the blob storage found in the `<snip>` resource group, and `KEYVAULT_URL` is the url of the key vault found likewhence"
[17:08:47] <Flonk> It makes sense in my head I swear
[17:09:46] <LuisR14> ...
[17:09:52] <CuriosTiger> that'd be more of a "likewhere" than a "likewhence"
[17:10:20] <CuriosTiger> English does have a loan word you can use for that if you're aiming for brevity rather than clarity.
[17:10:21] <CuriosTiger> "ditto"

[17:11:15] <Flonk> Likewhere works too
[17:11:22] <Flonk> Do people actually use "ditto" in this manner?
[17:12:00] <TimMc> It's not common, but I'd know what it meant.
[17:12:01] <CuriosTiger> Personally, I only use "ditto" when I want to give a brief "me too" response.
[17:12:10] <CuriosTiger> and even then, rarely.
[17:12:23] <TimMc> However, I suspect that if you used it in spoken English, I'd ask you to repeat yourself.
[17:12:32] <CuriosTiger> But then, I tend not to aim for the briefest possible sentence.
[17:13:33] <CuriosTiger> Like, if someone says "Jane and I are going to Texas Roadhouse tonight. Who wants to come?" and a few people had already said "I do", "me too" etc, I might use "ditto" just to vary the response.
[17:13:47] <CuriosTiger> but it's not a word I use frequently.
[17:13:54] <Flonk> Yeah, that's the way I use it in german too.
[17:14:26] <CuriosTiger> which makes sense, it has the same meaning in German. Although in German, I would usually just say "ich auch".
[17:14:43] <CuriosTiger> or "i oa" in Viennese.

[17:23:49] <CuriosTiger> Flonk: Of course, as an Ausländer, many of my colleagues and friends spoke Hochdeutsch with me, even if they speak more Wienerisch among themselves. So It wasn't all that bad.

So African-Americans who work around a lot of white people will often engage in 'code-switching' where they talk and behave in a way to make white people

[21:46:20] <GuiToris> how different 'for elise' from 'to elise'

[21:47:05] <TimMc> and people argue about that, yes?
[21:47:21] <TimMc> I would read "to Elise" as meaning it is *addressed* to her.

[23:28:06] <drocan> I break my sentences to lines so I can glance at the flow, and this particular one was sticking out, so I came here
[23:28:32] <drocan> thankfully newline and space are the same for latex

[23:56:15] <CuriosTiger> LjL: I'm a big fan of semi-colons if I'm separating a list that's JUST long enough to have commas inside each entry.
[23:57:07] <CuriosTiger> foo, the first variable, which we use for encryptiong the message from Alice; bar, the second variable, which we use for transmitting the encrypted payload; baz, which receives the decrypted result for Bob on the other end.
[23:57:59] <LjL> I don't find it stylistically awesome and I think it's arguably a misuse as semicolons normally separate different (if highly related) sentences and not just sentence fragment, but the semicolon is so little used anyway, I won't fault you for it
[23:58:53] <CuriosTiger> It depends on the medium, I think.
[23:59:24] <CuriosTiger> I find it helpful when I'm writing documentation or giving a relatively terse summary, but I eschew it in regular prose.
