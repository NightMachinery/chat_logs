[21:34:52] <tiotags> I doubt they could be faster
[21:35:57] <tiotags> imo it's nice that io_uring has syscall batching but the big advantage imo is that you can have buffers for incoming and outgoing data

[21:42:37] <tiotags> no more handling ECONTINUE as a special case (that you need to handle in a gui app or else)
[21:43:16] <tiotags> interrupts in general should be way better handled
[21:43:27] <V-T60> I guess that creating an IRC client must be very hard. Is it true?
[21:43:34] <rcf> It is not. 
[21:43:48] <Famine-> instead of coding a nice init function everything is randomly stuffed into 1024 byte structs
[21:44:56] <V-T60> I wish I could understand at least some of GNU basic utilities 
[21:45:07] <V-T60> For example, what really happens when I write "date"
[21:45:12] <V-T60> And so on

[21:46:27] <tiotags> you can use a callback Famine- you're kind of forced anyway, when callback 1 finishes it waits callback 2 ...
[21:47:48] <rcf> tiotags: it feels nice until one runs into the problems inherent with the kernel's monolithic architecture, at which point you realize that what you *really* want is the death of everything related to UNIX. 
[21:47:58] <tiotags> spawning a thread and using mutexes to share data with a 'gui thread' is way more complex that handling async buffers

[21:50:12] <V-T60> Famine-, that is so exciting 
[21:50:38] <Famine-> tiotags, the code i'm working on is embedded so no async issues for me.  but it's legacy written by a bunch of drunken possessed monkeys intent on violating every safe and sane programming practice they can
[21:51:57] <tiotags> rcf it's our fault for not moving to async faster, if they invented proper SSDs in the '70 then we wouldn't have this issue now
[21:51:58] *** Quits: skapata (~Skapata@user/skapata) (Remote host closed the connection)
[21:52:03] <rcf> tiotags: if one replaced the entire syscall interface with something along the lines of io_uring, then it would be worthwhile to move everything to adopt it. 
[21:52:58] <rcf> tiotags: but for now, other subsystems have shot down that idea entirely. No ioctl, and BPF restrictions means no chaining of operations together from unprivileged code. 
[21:53:21] <tiotags> rcf I'm not sure but I think io_uring doesn't handle reading from signalfd and a few other special read interfaces ... so ...
[21:53:47] <rcf> And it's that fact that breaks it, like every attempt to bolt async onto existing APIs or languages. 
[21:54:29] <tiotags> give it 20 years and we'll have a working async interface ... probably
[21:54:47] <Famine-> tiotags, so instead of something sane like: inputs.adc.mafraw  its page7.mafraw   because they just had to create the struct based off the page memory, so you have ~10 pages with 10 1024 item structs x.x
[21:55:19] <rcf> tiotags: this is actually incredibly amusing to hear because it's been said for the entirety of the past twenty years, even further back, really.
