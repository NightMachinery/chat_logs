[01:46:06] <jcbjoe2021> MetaNova: I think clientbuffer is working. I just added a client to the clientbuffer identifier setup znc on it and all messages are coming up. Maybe I wasn’t really understanding it or something. Anyway I just logged in right now and I got messages from a couple of days ago
[01:46:37] *** Joins: Cork (~Cork@user/cork)
[01:47:59] <MetaNova> jcbjoe2021: okay, cool. glad it's *finally* working
[01:49:29] <MetaNova> jcbjoe2021: specific point(s) of interest: not only do each client (phone, laptop, work, desktop, tablet, what-the-f***-ever) need separate and unique ClientIDs defined (zncuser@clientid/networkname:zncpass), but *clientbuffer needs to know precisely which client IDs it should be replicating buffers for
[01:49:53] <jcbjoe2021> Ok
[01:50:29] <MetaNova> jcbjoe2021: you will note that at https://wiki.znc.in/Multiple_clients#Full_overview step #4 I specifically mention that in order to prevent the need to tell *clientbuffer what IDs it should be tracking
[01:50:43] <MetaNova> you should load the clientbuffer module with the 'autoadd' argument
[01:51:11] <MetaNova> resulting in *clientbuffer automatically adding and recognizing and from that point on using whatever client IDs your clients connect with and supply
[01:51:45] <MetaNova> it actually eliminates all (or, at least, most of) the confusion (which sounds like what yours was) regarding some clients working and some not
[01:53:08] <jcbjoe2021>  ./msg *clientbuffer  autoadd ? Or do it from the web admin metaNova ?
[01:53:15] <MetaNova> no
[01:53:38] <MetaNova> from within your IRC client, not webadmin: /msg *status loadmod clientbuffer autoadd
[01:53:47] <jcbjoe2021> Oh
[01:53:59] <MetaNova> https://i.imgur.com/0vpqdcL.png
[01:54:37] <jcbjoe2021> Ok let me do that now. That’s for each network right?
[01:56:07] <MetaNova> yes
[01:56:17] <MetaNova> joe/oftc, joe/efnet, joe/libera, etcetera
[01:56:27] <MetaNova> done once on each. exact same command.
[01:56:38] <MetaNova> unload clientbuffer if it was already loaded
[01:56:51] <jcbjoe2021> Ok

[21:52:20] <gordonfish> Maybe I'm misunderstanding how ZNC works. I noticed that my phone lost it's connection for a couple hours and when it reconencted, I thought that ZNC would load all the messages that I had missed, since it was still connected to the end IRC server (libera), but I didn't see anything come in, it just picked up at the live point.

[21:56:59] <nuke> check your buffers settings, maybe u set it to not display, by default it shows

[22:18:51] <Khaytsus> gordonfish: Or you have multiple clients connected...
[22:19:30] <Khaytsus> by default, znc replays lines when all clients are disconnected.  Don't recall the numbers, maybe 50 per channel 500 total, something like that, don't recall.  But by default it just does it.
[22:19:46] <Khaytsus> So perhaps you changed something, or more likely, had a client connected.
[22:20:08] <Khaytsus> And if you need it to play back when using [[Multiple_clients]]  ...

[23:38:20] <gordonfish> Khaytsus: My desktop client was still connected. I don't understand why all clients would need to be disconnected, if I'm understanding correctly.

[23:38:44] <gordonfish> I had understood that if any client disconnects, and later reconnects, then what it missed would be replayed.
