[00:00:51] <Cl0udNinja> I dont think its any cheaper, but Alienvault might work too
[00:01:02] <Cl0udNinja> also, TIL alienvault got bought by ATT
[00:01:07] <Cl0udNinja> so... idk if thats any good

[00:03:06] <PublicWiFi> at&t bought it wow
[00:03:14] <Cl0udNinja> yeah
[00:03:23] <Cl0udNinja> I didnt know that until I was tryin to remember the name just now lol
[00:03:41] <Cl0udNinja> tbf the last time I used it was... almost 6 years ago

[00:05:04] <PublicWiFi> oh nvm
[00:05:05] <sd> 06<N‚ÄãinjaStyle> ?
[00:05:14] <PublicWiFi> found the git
[00:05:14] <NewYearsGibby> openvas is free
[00:05:20] <NewYearsGibby> and there is a community version of nessus 
[00:05:28] <PublicWiFi> scan 16 ips it says?
[00:05:31] <NewYearsGibby> but I think its limited to a certain amount of IPs 
[00:05:34] <PublicWiFi> yeah
[00:05:36] <Cl0udNinja> lmao
[00:05:38] <Cl0udNinja> its open source
[00:05:40] <PublicWiFi> is that IPs at once or IPs total?
[00:05:42] <Cl0udNinja> find the line that limits it
[00:05:46] <Cl0udNinja> change to 10000
[00:05:47] <Cl0udNinja> done

[00:12:14] <Cl0udNinja> eh, if you're set on installing it and using it always, sure, but for dev or testing, why muck up your machine if you have access to stand up VMs quickly lol

[00:14:08] <Cl0udNinja> like I said, if you're set on using it, sure, go for it, but if I'm just testing a software out, why do it on my system when I can fire up a vm

[08:17:28] <mjt> I can't imagine living in US and A with a BETA 120v supply voltage
[08:18:41] <yuken> mjt, the USA is 240V.
[08:18:45] <yuken> 120V over 2 phases.
[08:18:59] <yuken> You just connect both phases together, and there you go, 240V.
[08:19:03] <mjt> aren't most houses given a single phase? 
[08:19:16] <yuken> no.
[08:19:39] <yuken> Standard residential is 2 phases of 120V. Apartment complexes have... something weirder usually, split Y-phase that goes up to 208V.
[08:20:36] <mjt> but appliances over there run on 120v don't they? as in a kettle takes twice as long to book

[08:21:03] * mjt is aware (and sad) most Americans don't use kettles
[08:21:07] <yuken> mjt, it depends. If you plug a kettle into a standard wall outlet, yes.
[08:21:26] <yuken> A stove? 240V. Washer-driers are... I think 240V as well?
[08:23:36] <mjt> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split-phase_electric_power?wprov=sfla1
[08:24:20] <mjt> still prefer the simplicity of single phase 240v
[08:24:33] <yuken> mjt, technically nothing prevents you from running 240V over standard US plugs, although that's... stupid for a variety of reasons.

[19:23:07] <sd> 15<c‚Äãryptic1> I'd just like to interject for a moment. What you‚Äôre referring to as Linux, is in fact, Log4j, or as I‚Äôve recently taken to calling it, Log Forge. Linux is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning Log Forge system made useful by the Log Forge corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX.
[19:23:07] <sd> 15<c‚Äãryptic1> Many computer users run a modified version of the Log Forge system every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of Log Forge which is widely used today is often called ‚ÄúLinux‚Äù, and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the Log Forge system, developed by the Log4j Project. There really is a Linux, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the system they use.
[19:23:07] <sd> 15<c‚Äãryptic1> Linux is the kernel: the program in the system that allocates the machine‚Äôs resources to the other programs that you run. The kernel is an essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete operating system. Linux is normally used in combination with the Log Forge operating system: the whole system is basically Log Forge with Linux added, or Log Forge/Linux. All the so-called ‚ÄúLinux
