[05:32:09] <furq> i don't think you can call that making doom maps
[05:34:42] <pony> why not?
[05:38:18] <pony> furq: ?
[05:41:44] <furq> mostly because the levels it generates are shit

[06:53:01] <technomancy> what I dont' understand is how no one seems to have successfully integrated lua into an actual doom engine port
[06:53:29] <technomancy> everyone's just super obsessed with keeping compatibility with the miserably bad existing scripting languages or something
[06:53:57] <clever> technomancy: i wasnt even aware it had scripting languages, just crude triggers
[06:54:29] <technomancy> there's two languages but one of them might be just crude triggers yeah
[06:54:58] <clever> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0s4DpRTZenw Showcasing Doom's Line Specials
[06:55:05] <clever> technomancy: this goes over all of the triggers
[06:55:32] <technomancy> but like ... lua is the doom of programming languages
[06:55:42] <technomancy> it's a match made in heaven, or I guess in this case hell
[06:55:47] <clever> lol
[06:56:37] <clever> technomancy: another factor to consider, is time spent on lua, is time not spent on rendering a frame
[06:56:44] <furq> gzdoom has scripting
[06:56:50] <furq> acs or whatever
[06:56:59] <furq> that's not really doom any more though
[06:58:33] <technomancy> clever: thankfully computers are faster nowadays than they were when doom was originally created
[06:58:33] <technomancy>                                                          
[06:58:53] <clever> technomancy: all of those triggers, are just modifying a single thing in a lookup table used by other stuff, while lua is using a non-deterministic amount of cpu time
[06:59:01] <clever> yeah
[06:59:17] <clever> it was designed for a different era
[06:59:28] <technomancy> well, Marathon managed to add Lua without any trouble
[06:59:38] <technomancy> I mean obviously you have to still write good code
[07:01:21] <clever> technomancy: the opencomputers mod in minecraft, has a variant of the lua engine, that can pause the computation after a set amount of work completes, and serialize the engine state to disk
[07:01:39] <technomancy> can't you do that with debug.sethook without a variant?
[07:01:57] <clever> what about saving the entire compiled state and stack to disk?
[07:02:27] <furq> apparently they were discussing whether to use lua in gzdoom but ended up writing their own C# looking thing called zscript
[07:02:33] <furq> so there you go
[07:02:44] <technomancy> clever: it's not that hard; millions of games have found ways to do this
[07:02:54] <furq> this would have been '07 or so
[07:03:34] <furq> like i said though that's hardly even doom any more
[07:03:45] <clever> technomancy: i think the simpler answer is to not stave the lua engine state itself, but just some key global vars and design the code to allow that
[07:04:01] <clever> but the OC mod, is designed to run less well designed code
[07:04:28] <clever> where you can just have a busy loop that never returns, and still save/restore into it
[07:04:36] <technomancy> sure; you have to assume a higher skill level for people authoring maps vs people just playing minecraft or whatever

[07:05:17] <clever> WoW addons for example, only save global vars in a certain list, and all other state is lost
[07:05:28] <clever> its also entirely event driven, and if you busy loop, the rendering halts, so just dont do that :P
[07:06:03] <clever> but its running on the users own cpu, so they are the ones that pay the cpu usage costs
[07:06:23] <clever> while OC in MC, is running on the MC server, which may be a shared resource

[10:19:06] <avih> someone should write a doom lua script for mpv. we already have minesweeper...
[10:19:50] <furq> if you can write a doom renderer in libass then i'll be very impressed
[10:20:11] <furq> it couldn't be any slower than prboom's
[10:20:48] <avih> i surely can't. but someone should... :)
[10:21:47] <avih> worst case you create a "canvas" of 320x200 rects as pixels.
[10:24:25] <avih> or maybe compose a bmp or some such and make mpv display it per frame
[10:25:42] <avih> the rendering part is doable, even if it would be slow by default. but a small c plugin (mpv or lua module) could take care of converting a lua array into a bmp.

[15:40:58] <avih> furq: btw, you mentioned that luajit is much slower when calling c functions, i measured it and it's not meaningful. with a function which does nothing and returns one value, with this code: for _,i in 0,100000; do fn() done <- lua 5.1 and 5.2 manage about 30M calls/sec, while luajit about 26M on my system (the values are medians of several consecutive tests, and quite consistent between runs)
[15:43:14] <avih> (of course, it goes down quickly, calling one function in mpv after extracting the mpv context from the lua context - the minimal thing which an mpv lua-c function does, and it's 10x less iterations, and the c-call overhead is negligible, and it becomes mostly meaningless -

[15:45:45] <avih> so basically mpv is good for probably ~500K-3M api calls/sec from scripts, depending on the complexity of each api
[15:47:02] <avih> (of course, it's possible that luajit is super optimized for x86-64, and on other platforms it could be much slower compared to mainline lua)
[15:47:34] <avih> but on amd64 with luajit from this week, it's completely negligible.

[15:50:36] *** Joins: kiril (~kiril@85.91.153.163)
[15:50:48] <avih> what do you mean? isn't the whole point of luajit is to have jit? :)
[15:51:10] <andreyorst> luajit sometimes much faster than PUC even without jit compilation
[15:51:11] <avih> (also, i don't think i know how to "disable jit")
[15:52:37] <andreyorst> jit.off()
[15:52:39] <avih> but i'd imagine that people who use luajit don't disable jit, so that's probably the most correct mode to use for comparison with other lua versions.
[15:52:46] <avih> is it only from c?
[15:52:55] <avih> oh, looks like lua?
[15:54:42] <andreyorst> yes, it can be used in the script before your for loop
[15:55:47] <avih> right, with jit.off, c calls become about 1.5x faster than lua 5.1/2 (nearly 50M calls/sec)
[15:56:43] <avih> but of course, as soon as you start to actually do anything meaningful at the c function, then the pure lua-c call overhead really becomes negligible.
