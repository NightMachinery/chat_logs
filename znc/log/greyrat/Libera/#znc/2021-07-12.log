[02:04:01] <MetaNova> DarthGandalf: dav1d: correct. for two main reason: 1) not all networks support this, so it's not a mechanism you can rely on working, and 2) if you ever change your nickserv password, that requires you to /znc delserver, /znc addserver
[02:04:47] <Casper> Or change it in the webgui. :p

[02:11:21] <MetaNova> Casper: btw, why did you close requests for lunar?
[02:11:57] <MetaNova> I was going over the Providers diff history and noticed that a while ago
[02:12:27] <Casper> Because of the instability (which was mainly due to DDoS attacks), and in my opinion it's not fair to keep accepting new users when I can not guarantee a stable connection.
[02:13:10] <Casper> So in the meantime I've migrated to a different host, but that did not do too much at the beginning, however lately it appears a bit more stable again, not sure if the attacker simply stopped for a while before hitting it again later on.
[02:13:46] <Casper> But if it becomes stable and if I'm able to mitigate more of the attacks somehow, then I'd be willing to open up the registrations again.
[02:16:12] <MetaNova> so you're focusing on providing your existing users a quality experience
[02:16:26] <MetaNova> and once that is ironed out, potentially accept new users again
[02:16:28] <MetaNova> cool
[02:16:35] <MetaNova> thanks for answering :)
[02:16:57] <MetaNova> Casper: how many users total do you have, presently?
[02:17:56] <Casper> Exactly. Currently still over 300 active accounts (before I closed down I was at about 450-ish if I remember correctly)
[02:18:02] <MetaNova> wow
[02:18:04] <MetaNova> I have 67 on bnc4you and 294 on bnc4free
[02:18:33] <MetaNova> 33 client connections and 80 client connections, respectively
[02:18:47] <DarthGandalf> I had >1000 a while ago...
[02:19:03] <MetaNova> 125 and 367 defined networks, respectively
[02:19:58] <DarthGandalf> I don't remember exact number
[02:20:08] <Casper> 610 networks defined at the moment.
[02:20:13] <MetaNova> whew!
[02:20:14] <DarthGandalf> But at 1000 it became so slow that it had to be split to several processes
[02:20:43] <Casper> DarthGandalf, I actually split it up around 400~500 users because it got annoying then already.
[02:20:51] <MetaNova> DarthGandalf: yeah, splitting users across instances practically becomes a requirement after a certain number of users

[02:23:26] <MetaNova> I'
[02:23:31] <MetaNova> I'll ping the owner about it
[02:23:51] <DarthGandalf> I was helping to admin it, and that's how I got into ZNC development
[02:23:52] <Casper> All the info on that homepage is static and has been for months, heh.
[02:24:06] <DarthGandalf> by finding and fixing several bugs in it while already trying to run it for shellium
[02:24:23] <MetaNova> so you became a developer after already being an admin
[02:24:24] <MetaNova> nice
[02:24:28] <Casper> Hehe, that's nice indeed.
[02:24:33] <DarthGandalf> MetaNova: what do you mean?
[02:24:59] <MetaNova> you were using/administering ZNC before you began coding for it
[02:25:06] <MetaNova> if I understand your story correctly
[02:25:22] <DarthGandalf> Can it be the reverse?
[02:25:31] <DarthGandalf> "I began coding it before using it"?
[02:25:46] <DarthGandalf> That can be true only for new projects
[02:25:50] <MetaNova> I mean, I've heard of people picking up a project and diving into the code before they were an active user of the project
[02:25:51] <Casper> Sure, if you have an idea for something new, you have to begin coding before using it.
[02:25:58] <DarthGandalf> But ZNC already existed before me
[02:26:19] <MetaNova> I wasn't speaking to ZNC's existence, I was reflecting how you got involved with ZNC
[02:26:36] <MetaNova> it's cool you were just a user/admin before you took on development is all
[02:26:40] <Casper> And it could've been that you were using psybnc and then decided to start on znc, who knows.
[02:27:04] <DarthGandalf> I tried to run it once
[02:27:13] <MetaNova> (I wasn't claiming you created it)
[02:27:15] <Casper> I've never tried psybnc, heh.
[02:27:22] <DarthGandalf> but ZNC was so much better even at that time
[02:27:29] <MetaNova> I was a psybnc user, a long time ago
[02:27:35] <Casper> I've used (and liked) ZNC from the start.
[02:27:45] <MetaNova> it was pretty cool, because I didn't know any better (I hadn't used ZNC yet)
[02:28:02] <MetaNova> there is one feature I miss, though
[02:28:06] <Casper> If I'm right I began hosting an IRC network at home, but a ZNC service when I had my first VPS already.
[02:28:27] <MetaNova> the aggregation of multiple channels into a single buffer
[02:28:58] <Casper> Nah, I don't need that :P
[02:29:02] <MetaNova> buffer/output, anyway
[02:29:18] <MetaNova> Casper: I mean, I doubt I'd have /much/ use for it now
[02:29:41] <MetaNova> but I've heard other users (in this channel, even) ask about it - it'd be a cool feature to have available
[02:30:05] <MetaNova> even if I don't personally use it much (like plenty of other ZNC abilities - cool to have, I personally don't use them)
[02:30:30] <Casper> Just get AdiIRC and do: on *:TEXT:*:#: { echo @SPAMWINDOW $+(<,$asctime,-,$nick,>) $1- } :^) 
[02:30:43] <Casper> And same for ON ACTION then.
[02:31:01] <MetaNova> well yeah, if your client can mangle the buffers into one, that's terrific
[02:31:31] <MetaNova> but for clients that can't do that, having it as a ZNC function would be cool
[02:31:51] <MetaNova> (that's why ZNC is so powerful with the things it can do - it renders them client-agnostic)
[02:31:53] <Casper> True, some people might enjoy it. :p
[02:32:20] <MetaNova> like, I actively use some things on the ZNC side because my client simply _cannot_ do the same

[02:32:43] <CodeLyoko> MetaNova: i think i figured out what I did wrong. I did not have the intermediate cert for the root ca combined with my cert
[02:32:50] <CodeLyoko> only one way to find out now
[02:32:56] <MetaNova> CodeLyoko: I see. TIAS?

[08:57:57] <jmcgnh> joshuamoorexyz:-->  If you log into the webadmin interface to ZNC, you can edit your network settings to enable modules. There is moderately good documentation on what each one does. The clientbuffer module is "external" so you'd have to compile it and install it - not too hard, but maybe you can leave that for another time)
[08:58:21] <sheep> you probably don't need the clientbuffer module to make remembering channels work
[08:58:27] <sheep> how are you disconnecting irssi from Nc?
[08:58:30] <sheep> *znc
[09:09:41] <jmcgnh> tomf:-->  znc doesn't have file space that users can access. And while listnicks is a ZNC-specific command, IRC supports a NAMES function that most clients have a way to get at. Whether the client also provides a way to pour that list into a file would depend on which client - none of the ones I use seem to do that, but ones that support building
[09:09:41] <jmcgnh> IRC bots almost certainly do.

[09:21:26] <jmcgnh> More trouble than it's probably worth, given your use case.

[09:23:46] <jmcgnh> On election day, we get to count voters from the checklists based on first character of last name. I think it's M or S that has the most, there, too.
[09:26:30] <jmcgnh> As for IRC robots, I've been interested in looking at Soju and Gamja. I tried building an autoresponder based on a ZNC module (autoreply) and it kinda, sorta worked, but it didn't seem to have the right hooks to do what I needed.
