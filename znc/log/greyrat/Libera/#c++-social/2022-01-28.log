[15:02:33] <Carbonflux> it makes people angry.
[15:04:13] <T`aZ> but, the taste!
[15:05:07] <T`aZ> gonna prepare ox liver tonight
[15:05:13] <T`aZ> not really meat, so it's ok, right ?
[15:06:32] <Carbonflux> well, if you killed it yourself
[15:07:15] <jotham> Carbonflux: last year i worked out i'd need to probably keep about 24 chickens to just have 1 chicken a month
[15:07:23] <Carbonflux> its been known since ancient times that how an animal dies effects the taste of its meat,
[15:07:24] <jotham> Carbonflux: and everyone eats chicken like crazy
[15:07:46] <jotham> the algebra of eating meat is very bad when you try dig into it
[15:07:58] <jotham> i am mostly vegetarian now, not for political reasons
[15:08:01] <Carbonflux> the issue is factory farming 
[15:08:06] <jotham> just cause as i've got older i'm more vegetarian?
[15:08:22] <jotham> but western meat consumption is fucking ridiculous
[15:08:25] <Carbonflux> well, store bought meat is full of fear and anger
[15:08:32] <jotham> yeah i've been in a few chicken farms Carbonflux 
[15:08:43] <jotham> nz largely uses pasture for food
[15:08:47] <Carbonflux> ya, it has a big effect on climate change.
[15:09:04] <jotham> our government thinks we produce about enough food for 40 million people
[15:09:09] <jotham> just using pasture
[15:09:13] <jotham> and we have a pop of 5
[15:09:19] <jotham> so that all goes to europe and asia
[15:09:45] <Carbonflux> you don't really need to keep that many chickens if you let them have sex freely.
[15:10:03] <Carbonflux> they can make more and stuff
[15:10:19] <jotham> have you had chickens, i haven't, but two friends do
[15:10:24] <jotham> you need a huge population
[15:10:28] <Carbonflux> i don't

[15:10:44] <jotham> christ i never got birds to work in rimworld

[15:12:11] <Carbonflux> i don't normally eat anything that has eyes
[15:12:24] <Carbonflux> unless i am starving etc
[15:12:45] <T`aZ> what if it was born blind ?
[15:12:49] <Carbonflux> if i am really hungry i will eat whatever
[15:13:12] <Carbonflux> it still has eyes
[15:13:28] <Carbonflux> if you think about what eyes are
[15:13:36] <T`aZ> so oysters and mussels are ok
[15:13:45] <Carbonflux> maybe ya
[15:14:14] <Carbonflux> my issue is production to be clear
[15:14:19] <T`aZ> it's still living organism, that you eat raw, you pur some citrus on it to see it's still living before chewing them
[15:14:22] <T`aZ> so tasty
[15:16:28] <jotham> sea food is the worst fwiw
[15:16:33] <Carbonflux> its the same as the misinformation about being anti-vax, i am not against vaccine or meat but the production process.
[15:16:43] <jotham> we already destroyed the land, so the things growing on it are on destroyed territory
[15:16:53] <jotham> but we're ripping up the sea and it will kill our species
[15:17:02] <jotham> all the fucking oxygen comes from the sea
[15:17:14] <T`aZ> yeah, that's the biggest problem
[15:17:34] <T`aZ> not sure eating oysters is the cause of it though
[15:17:54] <jotham> Carbonflux: i wasn't comfortable with getting vaccinated until a country i trusted produced a vaccine
[15:18:04] <jotham> america, china, russia
[15:18:05] <jotham> fuck no
[15:18:06] <Carbonflux> oysters collect a lot of toxins actually.
[15:18:08] <jotham> get in the sea
[15:18:12] <T`aZ> you have specific yousters farms, you dont need to use net that will kill everything in its passage
[15:18:44] <jotham> fish farming is pretty bad, our government is actively fighting about it the last few years
[15:18:49] <jotham> pro and against
[15:19:25] <jotham> yeeting infinite tons of nitrogen into the rivers is bad too
[15:19:31] <jotham> so land farming fucking sucks also
[15:19:40] <Carbonflux> i kind of wished the covid vaccines were produced by an international non-profit org, but thats just not possible.
[15:20:14] <jotham> i'm okay with the germans making it and the americans branding it, least here in nz
[15:20:48] <jotham> unlike the rest of you guys
[15:20:56] <jotham> you probably don't know cause it doesn't matter
[15:21:05] <jotham> now nz has omicron we're all just waiting to get it
[15:21:12] <jotham> and we don't know what to think about that
[15:21:19] <jotham> it's affecting me
[15:21:23] <jotham> it's affecting the news here
[15:21:43] <T`aZ> lol, dont sweat it, you'll have a cough and a runny nose, done in 1 week, and you can go on with the rest of your life
[15:21:58] <T`aZ> some weaks will die though
[15:21:59] <Carbonflux> well, the pharma corps claim that without the profit motive people would just sit on their sofa, drinking booze and watching their family die a slow painful death. But if they can make a profit they would get up and do some science.
[15:23:11] <T`aZ> we are reaching the peak of the omicron wave soon, but icu usage is still being reduced day after day
[15:23:30] <jotham> nz has 5 million people and 120 icu beds
[15:23:37] <jotham> so govt is pretty concerned
[15:23:37] <T`aZ> lol
[15:23:53] <T`aZ> how come it's so low
[15:24:00] <Faux> https://twpol.github.io/coronavirus/summary?region=London london data for cases looks like they've simply stopped updating it, pretty amusing.
[15:24:09] <jotham> basically- for decades nz exports all its skilled workers
[15:24:15] <jotham> they come back to have kids
[15:24:32] <jotham> but our population is over 1 million out of country
[15:24:38] <jotham> for only 5 in country
[15:24:38] <Carbonflux> it seems to match the historical pattern of viruses, they get less lethal as they adapt to a host env.
[15:24:46] <jotham> but you can't stop training people
[15:24:53] <jotham> so we just train people for other countries
[15:24:55] <jotham> like uk and usa
[15:24:58] <jotham> and au
[15:25:05] <jotham> it's fucked but we can't help it
[15:25:13] <Carbonflux> i think most of the variants are coming from hospitals anyway.
[15:25:55] <Carbonflux> hospitals tend to be bioreactors
[15:26:03] <jotham> i think i read it was 6 nurses to maintain one icu bed for 24 hours
[15:26:10] <jotham> that's the real issue
[15:26:12] <jotham> not the material
[15:26:37] <Carbonflux> the health care industry is loving this
[15:26:57] <Carbonflux> they have never been more relevant.
[15:27:13] <jotham> what's funny is
[15:27:28] <jotham> nz has like a union style of public health
[15:27:33] <Carbonflux> remember, the hospital is a Victorian invention.
[15:27:34] <jotham> there are 24~ health bodies
[15:27:41] <Carbonflux> its really a place of horror
[15:27:48] <jotham> and the government started to collapse them back into a single governmental body
[15:27:52] <jotham> right before covid happened
[15:28:00] <jotham> so all our health care bodies are dismantling 
[15:28:05] <jotham> it's very dumb but funny

[15:29:46] <Carbonflux> the army came in a did that here too at first, but no one used it, so they gave up on that idea.

[15:32:24] <Carbonflux> so, there is a big disconnect.
[15:33:03] <jotham> okay but every country is reporting that same thing
[15:33:09] <jotham> even ones at war with each other
[15:33:29] <Carbonflux> maybe we need to rethink our frame of reference.
[15:33:36] <Oxyd> My friend waited at the hospital for four hours. Anecdotes are cheap.
[15:33:56] <jotham> yeah waiting time at the hospital here is 4-12 hours
[15:34:03] <jotham> and people actively complain about it
[15:34:15] <Carbonflux> four hours, omfg!!! 
[15:34:16] <Carbonflux> heh
[15:34:30] <Carbonflux> that was normal here before the pandemic.
[15:35:03] <jotham> in nz it's largely people that have hurt themselves drunk
[15:35:30] <Carbonflux> i was talking to someone today who knew a person who died waiting in the ER because he was a walkin rather then taking an ambulance.
[15:35:49] <jotham> that's rough

After this he asked about having it removed and the doctor told him he 
[15:58:21] <Carbonflux> was being stupid and that if he had it removed he might die if he had a heart attack in the future. He even mentioned the doctor gave him a really angry look for suggesting it.

[16:05:22] <Carbonflux> anyway, i think the real problem is my friend has really good heath insurance they just pays for everything. So every time he gets involved with the health care industry they manage to upsell him.
