[05:04:09] <pulse> pretty much spot on
[05:04:13] <apotheon> Speaking of qualia . . .
[05:04:22] <apotheon> . . . I'm going to go practice bass for a while.
[05:04:32] <pulse> nice
[05:04:35] <ProfSimm> ski:  I had a tiny breakthrough.   foo: [1, 2, 3, 4] assigns 1 to binding foo which is a sequence that repeats its last assignment i.e.  [1, 1, 1, 1, ...].  To replace the binding sequence entirely you use  foo: <= [1, 2, 3, 4] after which reading would produce 1, 2, 3, 4, null.  To move the sequence elsewhere use   => foo
[05:05:18] <ski> pulse : yea, except now they're more starting to be forced to acknowledge the problem
[05:05:35] <ProfSimm> ski: you can also destructure like:   (a, b, c): [1, 2, 3, 4]  // a = 1, b = 2, c = 3
[05:05:37] <pulse> ski, yeah, which is really embarrassing for them
[05:05:47] <ski> but it's also a great opportunity
[05:05:57] <pulse> it would be far easier if consciousness didn't exist. then they could claim the upper hand
[05:06:18] <pulse> but turns out that hippies who do DMT know more about consciousness than neuroscientists who study brains all their life. embarassing

[06:53:36] <oldlaptop> Alrighty. What "row number"? What do you mean by that?
[06:54:01] <gambl0re> if i get data from 10 from a table, i want the value 10 to be returned

[07:24:50] <duuude> ski: well, you are doing something somewhere and giving stuff to somewhere else. the LISP approach was confusing to me.

[07:28:11] <ski> they're non-local transfers of control. and more specifically, they're transfers of control to a destination that's not directly identified, but rather determined in terms of "nearest enclosing". this contributes to making it harder to reason about, and refactor, code

[07:30:07] <ProfSimm> duuude: one thing I like seeing in new languages is not treating types like something separate from the language. Types are just values. You don't need  Array<String> you can just:  type.array(type.string)

[08:14:19] <sonny> eDSL?

[08:18:47] <ski> ProfSimm : oh, Prolog can also often hold its own, for DSLs
[08:18:55] <ProfSimm> An ideal eDSL looks as clean as YAML (without the weird bits), provides autocompletion, contextual in the IDE without extensions, just through the language itself, and also happens to be valid syntax in the parent language
[08:19:08] <sonny> assemblers could be better, but there's a reason it's not common to use today, there are better solutions

[08:23:50] <ProfSimm> duuude: just install an extension means you can't sit down, whip up a DSL for your project and use it. No you need to now also write an extension and have everyone install it.
[08:24:05] <ProfSimm> duuude: that's death for eDSLs
[08:24:09] <duuude> or somehow include extensions with your code?
[08:24:26] <duuude> but installing looks cleaner
[08:24:40] <ProfSimm> duuude: well that's a roundabout way of saying "let the language provide the integration with its own eDSL"
[08:25:35] <duuude> no, like there is a standard lua api for extensions, and you include that with your code. nothing integrated to your language syntax

[08:49:12] <ProfSimm> sonny: oh it doesn't need to be that low level.
[08:49:52] <ProfSimm> sonny: the eDSL is eventually interpreted directly by code written in the parent language. Also when the language is homoiconic, it can compile an arbitrary AST and run it
[08:50:04] <deniska> sonny: the problem is that different languages may have different ideas how to store any non-trivial type, and how to handle object lifetimes (who needs to allocate memory, who and when and how needs to collect it)
[08:50:06] <ProfSimm> sonny: so let's say the interaction level is AST
[08:51:02] <ProfSimm> sonny: the AST then can produce some intermediate opcode stream, and be JITted and so on

[14:16:47] <smallville7123> nope
[14:17:24] <euouae> yawkat, why do you ask?
[14:17:56] <yawkat> my test case is spending most of its time on the cmp instructions
[14:18:20] <smallville7123> try simd
[14:18:21] <euouae> that's a linear cost, you can't optimize linear costs further 
[14:18:46] <pyzozord> doesn't seem like you can remove the condition
[14:19:03] <Decker> yawkat instead of comparing arr[i] increment arr and use arr[0]
[14:19:04] <pyzozord> maybe profile on the assembly level and see which ops take the most time? Not sure if that is even possible
[14:19:10] <pyzozord> simd is a good call here imo
[14:19:36] <euouae> how is simd a good call?
[14:19:50] <smallville7123> if you are comparing very large arrays then it might be wise to pipeline it, assuming the operation time exceeds that of thread synchronization overhead
[14:19:58] <yawkat> euouae: i can though, if i can make the cmp inside the loop into something bit fiddling, and can move the condition outside
[14:20:18] <yawkat> pyzozord: i am profiling the instructions
[14:20:20] <euouae> yawkat what are you trying to do? what program is this and what data are you feeding into it?
[14:20:31] <smallville7123> and assuming the full array gets scanned in most cases (eg it only returns short in few cases)
[14:21:12] <yawkat> euouae: this loop checks whether a string needs to be potentially escaped in json. it's basically an "ascii, but not a control char" check

[14:21:39] <bud> hello programmers!
[14:21:49] <nomagno> Hi
[14:22:05] <yawkat> and also, this is java, so i cant use simd directly. i can however nudge the jit towards using simd, if i can find the right code.
[14:22:06] <euouae> yawkat what performance loss have you obsrved? via what method?
[14:22:11] <smallville7123> yawkat: definitely cannot parelize that unless the json is huge
[14:22:29] <yawkat> yea parallel wont help
[14:22:41] <Decker> no pointers either so ou're stuck computing an offset
[14:23:08] <smallville7123> jni may help tho depends on the jni call overhead
[14:23:12] <yawkat> euouae: i am doing jmh benchmarks with perfasm, these cmps are maybe 50% of the time spent in that method?
[14:23:17] <Decker> so - to improve it use a different language :)  otherwise that's as good as it gets
[14:23:35] <euouae> yawkat 50% of time in that method does not explain why you think that method is a bottleneck
[14:23:58] <euouae> indeed, in for i = 0..100: f(i), you have f() take 100% of the loop... so what?

[14:34:01] <euouae> yawkat okay, right. Then again, this is not a normal optimization, especially not for something as trivial as a parser
[14:34:02] <teut> not sure if it's a law either
[14:34:10] <euouae> I can't think of it myself right now, but I do know it's wrong to even bother
[14:34:32] <euouae> and I dont' believe you when you say 50% nor do I understand why you're trying this...
[14:35:11] <euouae> oh wait, my method works
[14:35:20] <euouae> it returns true if any char was out of range

[14:35:38] <Decker> it doesn't retain any statis if < 32
[14:35:57] <yawkat> yea ive implemented this approach for >127 now, and it works (and is faster). but it doesnt for <32
[14:36:04] <euouae> no it works, if your'e over 128, it returns 0, and if you're below 32, it returns 0
[14:36:18] <yawkat> it works if all are <32, but not if only some are
[14:36:29] <euouae> it works
[14:37:13] <Decker> if you have 'a\n' it gets that A was valid (is not zero) but then the \n doesn't change that
[14:37:32] <euouae> (c & 11100000) ^ 10000000 is saying that you're over 31 and under 128
[14:37:58] <euouae> the first part says "over 31" the other part says "under 128"
[14:38:00] <bud> nomagno, and if i want to "subtitle" my project "based on i3wm", i need approval from from Michael Stapelberg? Also if i would rebrand completely, removing all traces to the original software (function names, docs, etc), only keeping (c) Michael Stapelberg. That would be "fine"?

[23:12:11] <deniska> johnny_sitar: rather pick a project, and if some new tech would work well for it, may as well learn it
[23:12:23] <pyzozord> oh yeah I do that sometimes too, I learned some basic TeX that way
[23:12:38] <deniska> Different people work differently, but I never found productive to just read/watch about new stuff without ever applying it to anything
[23:12:50] <pyzozord> pretty useless if you aren't in academia, but I was just following my curiosity
[23:12:51] <deniska> can be entertaining, but certainly not productive :)
[23:13:03] <bud> a great way of learning is teaching.
[23:13:26] <pyzozord> but I don't think it was a total waste, it informed my thinking about languages and algorithms a bit
[23:13:57] <pyzozord> I believe everything you learn no matter how irrelevant will contribute to your decisions and thinking process
[23:14:15] <deniska> Also, not learning anything new and just using proven tools you know how to work with is a valuable lesson in itself :D

[23:22:51] <deniska> not sure how it works tho
[23:23:08] <pulse> less sensory overload
[23:23:47] <johnny_sitar> wouldn't you say relying on inspiration striking you to start a side project, which then forces you to start learning something new is unreliable? unless you stick to your projects for many months/years OR if you easily find a new thing to do
[23:23:54] <pyzozord> it was so weird for me to learn that my friends mostly before they go to sleep they just make plan for the next day in their head
[23:24:25] <pyzozord> as long as I can remember I've been designing games
[23:24:25] <johnny_sitar> i guess judging from your answers there's nothing wrong with following your curiosity, even if it may not end up serving your future corporate overlord
[23:24:42] <bud> i told myself to start reading books before going to sleep again, been doing it for a couple of weeks now, and it is great, i really look forward to it. and due to internet brain i get really tired of reading.
[23:25:03] <pyzozord> johnny_sitar: it absolutely doesn't matter where you start, iteration is what matters
[23:25:04] <pulse> bud, i've started reading books again too. it's interesting what it does to your mind
[23:25:07] <deniska> I mean, there's a difference between browsing youtube at 11PM when it feels nice, and at 2AM when you hate yourself :D
[23:25:16] <pulse> youtube feels like fastfood compared to books
[23:25:23] <deniska> pulse: nom nom
[23:25:33] <pyzozord> don't agree about books
[23:25:45] <absentia> yeah what about the bible
[23:25:47] <bud> pulse: nice, there is a good book on the topic (interent brain) called the shallows.
[23:25:47] <pyzozord> there is nothing inherently noble about reading books
[23:25:47] <absentia> oh shit
[23:25:47] <johnny_sitar> pyzozord: by "iteration" you mean "just sticking to it"/"moving forward"?
[23:26:02] <pulse> pyzozord, when's the last time you read one?
[23:26:09] <pyzozord> johnny_sitar: trying things seeing what works, discovering new ideas, trying more

[23:27:15] <pyzozord> pulse: and I'm listening to podcast Writing Excuses

[23:27:37] <pulse> depends how you define noble
[23:27:49] <pulse> thing about books is, they allow you to relax into a certain state of mind

[23:28:06] <pyzozord> i think it's hyped up in the popular conciousness, books are associated with being smart, sophisticated etc
[23:28:13] <pyzozord> but they can be as dumb as youtube
[23:28:20] <pyzozord> it's just different format
[23:28:41] <pulse> i suppose
[23:28:42] <pyzozord> anyone can write a book
[23:28:53] <pulse> that's not true though
[23:28:56] <pyzozord> anyone can make a youtube video
[23:29:04] <pulse> i'd argue most people can't write a book
[23:29:19] <bud> anyone can not write a book. most can't even read one today.

[23:31:20] <pyzozord> yes books have higher chance of having good content
[23:31:24] <pulse> it has historical value. books pretty much kickstarted the information revolution
[23:31:25] <johnny_sitar> as for internet binging at night, just accept you're a junkie and start treating yourself like one. I have several timewasters blocked in pihole AND in the local firefox LeechBlock extension.

[23:32:16] <pyzozord> yes, books as a heuristic for finding hight quality content ok
[23:32:17] <pulse> you end up wasting 95% of time on crap
[23:32:21] <vdamewood> Yay, I'm back again.
[23:32:25] <pulse> and internet crap has addictive qualities
[23:32:39] <pulse> you watch one crappy youtube video and suddenly you find yourself binging crappy videos for hours
[23:32:42] <pulse> that's just unhealthy
[23:32:48] <pyzozord> but really putting books on the pedestal for the sake of fliping thing wooden slices, nothing special
[23:32:48] <pulse> can't say the same about books

[23:33:22] <bud> no trees where harmed in the process
[23:33:25] <pulse> even audiobooks are better than binging youtube
[23:33:34] <vdamewood> Books are better curated than online content.
[23:33:37] <vdamewood> Usually
[23:33:45] <deniska> yeah, because you don't drop anything onto your face if you fall asleep to an audiobook
[23:33:59] <pyzozord> bud: I see how you could interpret it that way, but I didn't mean it that way. What I said was also meant for digital books
[23:34:00] <pulse> hehe
[23:34:02] * vdamewood drops a cat on deniska's face.
[23:34:14] <deniska> Now interestingly enough, books are not better, sometimes even worse, than laptops and phones in that regard
[23:34:31] <bud> pyzozord: are you dyslectic?
[23:34:37] <vdamewood> deniska: Droping on your face?
[23:34:50] <vdamewood> I'd rather get a paperback novel dropped on my face than a laptop.
[23:34:51] <pyzozord> vdamewood: usually, but nowadays self publishing books online is really trivial
[23:34:54] <pyzozord> bud: yeah
[23:35:09] <absentia> publishing houses have a brand to maintain
[23:35:12] <vdamewood> pyzozord: Yeah, even Intel does it these days.
[23:35:17] <absentia> if they just start cranking out garbage
[23:35:21] <absentia> they become "the garbage publisher"
[23:35:28] <deniska> vdamewood: I was always more concerned about a laptop than about a face
[23:35:35] <johnny_sitar> recommend "clickbait remover for youtube" (randomize thumbnails) and "unhook" (hide yt ui elements like recommended vids) ff extensions for youtube also. there are many extensions which de-dopaminize common sites (eg. remove algorithmic content on twitter etc.)
[23:35:37] <deniska> hinge motion cushions the fall
[23:35:43] <pulse> pyzozord, i agree books aren't absolutely better though. there's crappy books that just waste your time
[23:36:06] <absentia> block reddit, turn off youtube search history
[23:36:10] <pyzozord> pulse: that was all I was saying :)
[23:36:13] <pulse> but in general i do think that it's probably more intelligent to read books than consume online content, if nothing else because of the aforementioned crap/addictive factor
[23:36:14] <absentia> that way your yt homepage isn't full of THE FEED
[23:36:22] <deniska> A lot of books about <some recent tech thingie> are not that much better than a youtube video
[23:36:22] <absentia> but your subscriptions and shit you actually wanted to watch
[23:36:35] <pyzozord> pulse: eh, depends what books you choose, and what internet content you choose
[23:36:42] <pulse> a book reading addiction is usually a good thing. a youtube addiction is never a good thing
[23:36:44] <johnny_sitar> blocking reddit doesn't work, you always end up searching something and the only info you can find is there sometimes
[23:36:51] <deniska> absentia: or you can set up https://www.youtube.com/feed/subscriptions as your youtube bookmark
[23:36:54] <absentia> johnny_sitar: reddit SNR is approaching 0
[23:36:57] <pulse> pyzozord, it doesn't really matter because internet consumes you easily
[23:37:11] <pulse> it's much easier to find yourself wasting time online than reading books
[23:37:13] <absentia> i view reddit today as equivalent to facebook a decade ago
[23:37:17] <pulse> probably because reading books takes more effort
[23:37:17] <absentia> it's no longer a source of good information

[23:51:20] <pyzozord> books are just a lot of written text

[23:52:48] <nomagno> I think the key thing to take away is that text media is easier to scrutinize and pick apart for your own good than video media
[23:52:59] <ProfSimm> ski: made an impression on me that LAMBDA is showing Excel using the expression AST not in a traditional way, i.e.lambda(a, b, a + b) <-- implies the lambda sees the AST of its arguments, not what they evaluate to
[23:53:01] <pyzozord> ok fair, but I don't think pulse meant picture books
[23:53:18] <ProfSimm> ski: this is a bit like what I'm trying to do but it I wanna avoid a mess so I keep going back and forth on it
[23:53:25] <GeDaMo> Sorry, I'm not really paying attention :P
[23:54:30] <pyzozord> no worries, I was just trying to convince pulse that there isn't anything noble about reading books vs consuming other forms of media
[23:54:37] <bud> nomagno: another key thing is that books can prevent help you from getting total internetbrain (extremely short attentionspan, fun fun fun).
[23:54:48] <ProfSimm> What was the name for var scope that sees the scope of its caller. Dynamic vs lexical scope I think
[23:54:54] <ProfSimm> Is there a modern language with dynamic scope/
[23:55:00] <ski> ProfSimm : i guess `lambda' is a "special form" (in Lispy terms), there. aka "syntax"

[23:55:58] <ProfSimm> ski: pyzozord isn't that lexical
[23:56:00] <nomagno> Which version of TCP do I want to implement for minimizing work and maximizing compatibility?
[23:56:13] <pulse> tcp through udp xD
[23:56:14] <nomagno> or, well, what combination of base spec and extensions?
[23:56:28] <pyzozord> ProfSimm: sounds lexical but I never heard that term used in that context, maybe more of a lanuage design jargon
[23:56:36] <ski> scope in Emacs lisp is dynamic, by default. it has acquired lexical/static scope now, as well, though. but you have to ask for it, to get it
[23:56:44] <nomagno> pulse: That's not really possible though. You can encode tcp in udp, but you can't actually send TCP packets as UDP
[23:56:52] <ProfSimm> ski: there have been "lesser" languages that permit things like calling foo() and foo sees all your local vars and can even modify them.
[23:56:52] <absentia> perl has dynamic scoping
[23:56:53] <pyzozord> ProfSimm: *sounds reasonable
[23:56:55] <absentia> god forbid
[23:57:03] <absentia> purchase a bucket of holy water
[23:57:07] <ProfSimm> ski: it's hard to optimize for compilation but the meta caps are through the roof
[23:57:12] <pulse> nomagno, you can create a tcp tunnel that works on udp
[23:57:24] <absentia> oh wait you said modern language

[23:57:40] <ski> i think most people nowadays agree that dynamic scope by default is a mistake
[23:58:05] <ski> (btw, there's also dynamic scope in math (although not by default) .. did you know that ?)
[23:58:19] <ProfSimm> ski: not by default for sure, but the question is, is it a good idea to have an api for it. Like  parentScope.a = 10 <--- sets a in the caller scope to 10
[23:58:27] <nomagno> pulse: I just want to know which TCP specs to implement and be done with it
[23:58:32] <nomagno> Don't want to mess around further
[23:58:39] <ProfSimm> ski: oh is there
[23:59:09] <ski> ProfSimm : well, it breaks encapsulation, information hiding. making it harder to be independent of implementation details, and therefore harder to swap out (improve) an implementation with another one
