[02:55:29] <maret> need a way to query bitcoin blockchain fast, need address and its transactions and I couldnt find a fastt way, so I thats why I want to use postgress
[02:56:06] <maret> therehttps://github.com/blockchain-etl/bitcoin-etl which helps with easy export to json and from there I could somehow import it into postgres  (maybe through jq to convert it to csv first)
[02:56:46] *** Quits: clstrfsck (~clstrfsck@95.148.138.228) (Quit: Textual IRC Client: www.textualapp.com)
[02:57:21] <earnestly> leveldb isn't fast?
[02:59:04] <maret> not sure how can you query it, I have more experience with postgres and sql
[03:00:30] <maret> also I am guessing that structure of the data in leveldb wont be in a format I need it  seems like there is extra processing done by tools like https://github.com/blockchain-etl/bitcoin-etl
[03:01:08] *** Joins: ferdna (~ferdna@user/ferdna)
[03:03:05] <luke-jr> maret: the blockchain isn't a database and shouldn't be stored in one
[03:03:18] <luke-jr> earnestly: the UTXO db is in LevelDB, not the blockchain
[03:03:45] <earnestly> Yeah was just looking and that leveldb contains the headers
[03:04:10] <earnestly> luke-jr: Is the block format documented?
[03:04:12] <luke-jr> sure
[03:04:41] <earnestly> https://developer.bitcoin.org/reference/block_chain.html
[03:04:46] <luke-jr> https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Protocol_documentation#block
[03:04:49] <maret> Hi Luke! Well I want to query t fast so I am not sure what else to do. I tried to use Blockstream esplora api but its slow, it returns only 25 transactions per request per address, which is not suitable for large addreses
[03:05:09] <luke-jr> maret: a single address should only be used in a single transaction
[03:05:44] <maret> I agree, but thats not the case  unfortunatelly
[03:05:58] <luke-jr> I wrote code that could do it fast once, but it's not really polished
[03:06:12] <luke-jr> and uses a completely custom format
[03:06:29] <earnestly> I doubt the format is hashed against the address, so you might have to iterate unless reworking it into a new format that allows this
[03:06:31] <luke-jr> the real question is why you want this
[03:06:32] <maret> and thats not why I am here for. I just wwould like to be able to get transactions for any address fast
[03:06:41] <luke-jr> trying to get this, indicates a flaw in the use case
[03:07:11] <earnestly> maret: You'll have to create a database by dumping the blocks and keying it on addresses
[03:07:12] <luke-jr> earnestly: there are no indexes kept that would be useful, since this isn't something people are supposed to do
[03:07:14] <maret> sort of side project -> blockchain like explorer
[03:07:24] <earnestly> luke-jr: Yeah, that's fair enough
[03:07:35] <earnestly> So the solution is for them to generate such a format for their needs
[03:08:08] <maret> for example there is https://github.com/blkchain/blkchain but it doesnt support taproot yet
[03:08:38] <earnestly> maret: Might as well see about adding taproot support to that, since it appears to do what you want-ish
[03:08:46] <maret> this one actually seem to read levelsdb directly
[03:08:54] <maret> yeah I would love to! not good with go though
[03:08:57] <luke-jr> LevelDB doesn't have the information you want
[03:08:59] <earnestly> maret: (The blocks aren't leveldb, so that's not helpful)
[03:10:06] <maret> yeah, I am not planning to use it, I am jsut saying that parituclar tool seems to read levels db. My plan was to use bitcoin elt project which exports transactions data as a json which I can then import to postgres
[03:10:23] <luke-jr> FWIW there was https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14053 a year ago, but these things tend to go nowhere due to lack of a valid use case
[03:10:40] <earnestly> It's not just about importing to postgres, you need to format in a way that makes querying it fast for your purpose
[03:10:53] <luke-jr> maret: I'm not sure you appreciate how complex what you want is. Postgres would use several TB at least
[03:11:03] <earnestly> The import will be slow, and shouldn't matter that much if the faster queries are the result
[03:11:09] <luke-jr> and probably require a LOT of memory dedicated to it
[03:11:46] <earnestly> Yeah, this is why I'm suggesting just pulling out the addresses as key and assigning multiple txids to it, just so you can get all txids for a given address
[03:11:58] <earnestly> Without any of the other data
[03:12:06] <maret> :( yeaH I am getting worried about it well my hope is that I don't want to / need to import everything from transactiosn do I
[03:12:28] <maret> earnestly yeah thats pretty much what I want if I understand you correctly
[03:13:04] <maret> so if you take a look at transaction.json schemahttps://github.com/blockchain-etl/bitcoin-etl#transactionsjson  like I dont need most of data there
[03:13:09] <zemzem> .crypto btc eth xrp
[03:13:21] <earnestly> maret: You can probably do napkin math by counting total addresses in use, and how much that'll consume on psql
[03:13:33] <zemzem> whoops
[03:13:39] <earnestly> To literally just store the addresses and nothing else
[03:13:55] <maret> yeah well I am sure, but maybe I am naive that it should be doable
[03:14:00] <earnestly> Then multiply that by 5 or so as a ballpark
[03:14:17] <maret> it will take a lot of storage but should be fine
[03:14:39] <earnestly> maret: There's 20 million addresses, so estimate about 100 million records
[03:15:11] <earnestly> How much space does psql take for 1 record?
[03:15:18] <earnestly> (Does it scale linearly?)
[03:15:43] <earnestly> maret: You can test this by filling out a database with junk data of the same order and see

[03:17:46] <maret> yeah, well I am planing to import whats there seems like i need only transaction ID / hash, is_coinbase,  inputs and ouputs and ouputs hopefully I only need like value and addresses array
[03:18:30] <maret> really now I just concerned about what to import and whatt. Seems like JSON -> CVS -> psql is one option
[03:18:58] <maret> I could do slower by using JSON -> nodejs script -> postgress
[03:21:00] <earnestly> maret: If 100 million rows, assuming 8k pages with 128 rows per page, that'd be 6G or so
[03:21:03] <earnestly> Of storage

[16:29:17] <Victorsueca> yeah, that's more accurate, some services give payouts with coins that are not newly minted
[16:30:28] <maret_> true so take  getrawtransaction 693e5d6ef5e612f6a326f4f20ad085393d3c14c02bd3269c6fa7df626d109b84 true  , it has txinwitness  so  thre is no raw info about address
[16:30:41] <maret_> unlike vout which has address field as part of scripPubykety field
[16:31:28] <Victorsueca> maret_: transaction inputs are more like pointers to previous transaction outputs
[16:32:19] <Victorsueca> internally there isn't really such thing as input address, it just points to and spends a previous output from an earlier transaction
[16:35:15] <maret_> yeah so if you can follow up the example with so https://blockchain.info/rawtx/693e5d6ef5e612f6a326f4f20ad085393d3c14c02bd3269c6fa7df626d109b84 has two inputs  first is point to transaction id 7326413a141218d4ad000e96d3a70066239bedca2f42a0f75da3b95cde15ac26  -> https://blockchain.info/rawtx/7326413a141218d4ad000e96d3a70066239bedca2f42a0f75da3b95cde15ac26. Which has several outputs some of them still unspent so how do i know which ouputs were
[16:35:15] <maret_>  used
[16:35:43] <maret_> btw seems like blockchain.info/rawtx has enriched format/ its own format for the transaction ?
[16:39:38] <Victorsueca> maret_: It should mention somewhere in the raw transaction which vout from the previous transaction is it spending

[16:51:20] <s17> maret_: I'm not sure what you're asking, but one could receive multiple times to the same pubkey/address and each of those transactions produce different coins.  those coins can all be used as inputs on a future transaction
[16:51:47] <s17> so if you were to decode the transaction, you would see more than one input (previous txout) with all the same 'address'
[16:53:34] <s17> aha, just as you're seeing in the 693e5.. transaction
[16:53:39] <maret_> the reason i am asking this is, because I am using bitcoin-etl tool and it has array for input addresses so that implies there can be multiple addresses associated with it https://github.com/blockchain-etl/bitcoin-etl#transactioninput from their schema description for addresses field -> Addresses which own the spent output
[16:54:09] <maret_> I guess that could be for example for multisignature transaction?
[16:54:25] <s17> imagine a "donation" address on my website.  I receive a donation on Monday and one on Tuesday.  On Wednesday, I bundle those two outputs into a new transaction..
[16:55:42] <s17> there can be multiple inputs, each with their own address
[16:55:54] <s17> and each input could have the same 'address'
[16:56:03] <s17> because of address re-use
[17:01:18] <s17> you're not going to have multiple addresses for the same input
[17:01:32] <s17> you can have different address formats, but that's something else

[18:26:47] <buZz> i think you cant really test 'bitcoin rpc' without 'bitcoin rpc'

[18:27:04] <buZz> wait, maret_ , you -do- mean bitcoin core rpc?
[18:27:16] <buZz> not just any blockexplorer's bitcoin api?
[18:28:03] <buZz> for soooo much stuff on btc you dont ever need a real wallet, like sending tx, or checking for incoming funds etc
[18:29:53] <earnestly> Afaiui electrum has a kind of terminal interface via their GUI to submit various rpc commands, some of which appear to be copies of bitcoin core's.  If you were to expose an rpc interface it would have to be fairly heavily filtered to prevent much of the destructive commands
[18:30:08] <maret_> i mean there should be some api like https://www.blockchain.com/api/blockchain_api   it jus tthat they seem to have the same json as pure bitcoin rpc
