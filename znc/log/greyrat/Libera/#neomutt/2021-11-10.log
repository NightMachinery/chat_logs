[13:38:52] <flatcap> (that'd tell us exactly where in the code NeoMutt crashed)
[13:39:52] <flatcap> also, can you try some variations in the config to check that's really the problem line...
[13:40:46] <flatcap> comment it out; change the pattern; (I can't think of any more :-)
[13:40:58] <gahr> Hi flatcap 
[13:41:52] <flatcap> hi gahr 
[14:00:41] <ckardaris> good morning guys
[14:00:45] <flatcap> hi ckardaris 
[14:01:42] <ckardaris> I have made good progress with the IPC. I try to move a little bit further every day after work. If I am in the mood of course
[14:02:14] <ckardaris> But just to give you an idea, I have been able to send and execute commands and change folders
[14:02:16] <flatcap> that's great news
[14:02:39] <flatcap> when to we get to see some code?
[14:02:51] * flatcap says eagerly :-)
[14:03:15] <ckardaris> Let me see if I can push to my fork and you can check it right now
[14:04:29] <flatcap> cool
[14:05:39] <flatcap> ALL: can anyone explain simply the difference between OAUTH, OAUTH2 and XOAUTH?
[14:05:52] <flatcap> anyone using them for NeoMutt?
[14:06:33] <flatcap> we have docs for OAUTH, but does it work OK? https://neomutt.org/guide/optionalfeatures.html#oauth
[14:09:43] <ckardaris> https://github.com/ckardaris/neomutt/tree/ipc
[14:10:04] <ckardaris> https://gist.github.com/ckardaris/858edce8ddf48efc9b73a459f840d39e
[14:10:13] <ckardaris> The gist is the client
[14:11:01] <ckardaris> You should be able to do: neomutt-msg -e command. Currently no quotes, use spaces (e.g neomutt-msg -e set sidebar-visible=no) 
[14:11:35] <ckardaris> neomutt-msg -F config. Internally the client will send the command "source config"
[14:11:38] * flatcap builds ...
[14:11:44] <ckardaris> And neomutt-msg -m to change mailboc
[14:11:58] <ckardaris> Again you can use what you would type after pressing m in neomutt
[14:12:13] <ckardaris> Sorry -f
[14:12:28] <flatcap> hmm...
[14:12:39] <ckardaris> neomutt-msg -f Sent or neomutt-msg -f =Junk or neomutt-mgs -f ./mail/gmail/Sent
[14:12:56] <ckardaris> The details will be up for discussion of course
[14:19:08] <flatcap> hmm...

[14:19:17] <flatcap> ERROR INCORRECT NEOMUTT IPC IDENTIFIER
[14:20:24] <flatcap> which is coming from *neomutt*, which is a good sign :-)
[14:20:51] <ckardaris> Yes. The client must be wrong somehow. I have many versions. Hehe
[14:21:24] <flatcap> ok :-)
[14:21:50] <flatcap> the gist doesn't compile (missing > on a #include), so I guess that's not the latest
[14:23:35] <ckardaris> I updated it. Could you check now?

[16:50:34] <gahr> flatcap: hi, what do you think about the ato* functions?
[16:51:08] <gahr> perhaps we should return a structured result? { long res; bool overflow; bool complete; const char *end; } ?
[16:52:42] <flatcap> oh!  that's quite a step :-)
[16:53:49] * flatcap looks at upstream...
[16:54:29] <flatcap> they changed all the prototypes to: int mutt_atoX (const char *str, long long *result, int flags)
[16:55:18] <gahr> oh, so we get to pass flags at caller side
[16:55:56] <flatcap> hmm... they have MUTT_ATOI_ALLOW_EMPTY, _ALLOW_TRAILING
[16:56:12] <gahr> yeah
[16:56:19] <gahr> I'd rather expose different functions
[16:56:47] <flatcap> yeah, like your str_ functions
[16:56:48] <gahr> or return different error codes
[16:57:25] <gahr> 0 - all good and fully converted, 1 - not fully converted, 2 - converted but overflow, 3 - no conversion possible
[16:57:29] <flatcap> I haven't looked at how were using the ato* functions, to see what we really need
[16:57:32] <gahr> but we still fail to catch the end pointer
[16:57:48] <gahr> so we end up doing
[16:57:48] <gahr>  while (*p && isdigit((int) *p))
[16:57:49] <gahr>         p++;
[16:58:18] <gahr> see the change in my code.. the native C library function is much more handy
[16:58:39] <flatcap> yeah
[16:59:10] <gahr> perhaps we could return endptr and that's it
[16:59:26] <flatcap> yeah, that would do
[16:59:34] <gahr> endptr == NULL -> no conversion, *endptr == '\0' -> fully converted, otherwise it points to the end
[16:59:45] <gahr> we just miss to detect under/overflow
[16:59:46] <flatcap> ok
[17:01:00] <flatcap> have you got the time to read the 50 uses and categorise them?
[17:01:17] <gahr> doing it now
[17:01:34] <ckardaris> flatcap: I had to be gone. Yes, the code is not even close to be done. Messages should be better structured. Also to be able to handle multiple consecutive requests and all that. But you get the idea of what I am working towards. It will take time, but I think it will worth it
[17:01:59] <gahr> my hunch is nobody cares about overflow
[17:02:31] <flatcap> gahr: ok
[17:02:49] <flatcap> ckardaris: of course :-)
[17:03:09] <gahr> shall we merge the PR now and I'll do that separately?
[17:04:37] <flatcap> yes
[17:06:21] <gahr> perhaps I'm merging the no-conversion with the overlow case
[17:06:27] <gahr> and just return NULL
