[01:19:51] <ThePendulum> a lot of the meat around here is imported from eastern europe

[01:20:11] <GreenJello> theskillwithin, but with the population of DC
[01:20:16] <ljharb> ThePendulum: buying *no* meat doesn't vote for ethical animal practices, it votes for "the animal industry no longer cares about you"
[01:20:23] <systemfault> ThePendulum: No farms where you live? If you're importing meat, it's because there's a demand for cheaper meat
[01:20:29] <ThePendulum> ljharb: not sure what your point is, that is generally what people are going for
[01:20:46] <ljharb> ThePendulum: i'm saying that ethical concerns mean you should buy as much meat as you can from wherever treats the animals best
[01:20:49] <qswz> holland have a lot of vegetable farms
[01:21:04] <ljharb> ThePendulum: and literally every dollar you don't spend on that is failing to incentivize better animal treatment

[01:23:19] <ThePendulum> ljharb: that is true for literally anything, no individual is going to achieve something on their own. if there are less people eating the animals, there are going to be less animals bred. there is only so much more the remaining people can eat

[04:46:15] <Voxel> Hey all ^^
[04:46:56] <Voxel> For some reason the "return" part doesn't execute: https://paste.ofcode.org/6fmhZ3yWLaTb3xCAEKE9Lx
[04:47:54] <Voxel> It's called like: "Test("123').then(() => { process.exit(0) })";
[04:49:27] <Voxel> It believe it's because the first Promise resolves and returns. Then next callback is launched which exits the script.
[04:49:35] <Voxel> I believe*
[04:49:43] <Voxel> Is it correct?
[04:49:44] *** Joins: pavonia (~user@user/siracusa)
[04:50:27] <GreenJello> how do you know it doesn't execute?
[04:52:16] <Voxel> No console message and breakpoint jumps to Exit part immediately before turn part.
[04:52:26] <Voxel> return part*
[04:53:26] <GreenJello> wouldn't recommend trusting debuggers with async code. Try adding a log after the await line
[04:54:25] <Voxel> Nice idea, but no message - tested right now.
[04:54:45] <GreenJello> maybe something weird in UserFInd
[04:55:23] <GreenJello> run it without the debugger running, if you didn't
[04:56:08] <Voxel> This is UserFind: https://paste.ofcode.org/35asU3gGmC7AZKwYskGTt4k
[04:56:49] <GreenJello> no obvious issues there

[08:29:24] <skillbot> YouTube Title: How Huffman Trees Work - Computerphile
[08:31:42] <sheetjs> so in the specific context of DEFLATE, the pkzip people had the idea of hardcoding the tree
[08:31:52] <sheetjs> the problem is that the tree is really really suboptimal
[08:32:36] <sheetjs> for the types of xml file you find in XLSX, the fixed tree compression is basically nonexistent
[08:33:08] <theskillwithin> so deflate essentially means decompress?
[08:33:27] *** Quits: wroathe (~wroathe@user/wroathe) (Ping timeout: 245 seconds)
[08:33:30] <sheetjs> DEFLATE is actually the compression, "inflate" is the decompression
[08:33:36] <theskillwithin> oh
[08:33:49] <sheetjs> think of a balloon
[08:34:13] <theskillwithin> i was, when u delfate a balloon the air is less compressed
[08:34:35] <theskillwithin> deflate*
[08:34:40] <sheetjs> the volume of the balloon
[08:34:51] <theskillwithin> ah
[08:35:56] <theskillwithin> i don't like that terminology, but im glad i know what it means now
[08:39:00] <sheetjs> since you were asking about bit ops yesterday, it actually shows up in part of the problem
[08:39:56] <sheetjs> part of the compression scheme involves identifying repeated sequences of data
[08:40:17] <sheetjs> e.g. "<c><v>123</v></c><c><v>234</v></c>"
[08:40:21] *** Joins: wintersky (uid453465@id-453465.helmsley.irccloud.com)
[08:40:27] <sheetjs> you see "<c><v>" shows up twice
[08:41:01] <sheetjs> the compression scheme supports "copy tokens" which basically say to jump back and copy from earlier in the file

[08:41:55] <sheetjs> this is a semi-interesting question in javascript, and touches upon some string searching algorithms like rabin-karp and knuth-morris-pratt
[08:42:02] <theskillwithin> the video was talking about probabilities tho, so that example might not apply to this
[08:43:18] <theskillwithin> sheetjs so basically it somehow helps with intelligent compression ill call it for lack of better term

[11:54:28] <Koopz> here's a rough something of what i just realized
[11:56:33] <Koopz> i'm in the middle of refactoring a .html file containing all js and splitting up the code and just saw that i was accessing the mediaTypeSelect in BetterList.js but the variable definition was located in Columns.js
[11:57:19] <Koopz> i assumed there would be some kind of scoping done when doing imports but apparently that's not the case

[12:33:46] <electrostatic> does getColumns use mediaTypeSelect  ?
[12:35:58] <Koopz> it's actually used in columnDefs which brings up an entirely different issue i have to solve
[12:36:37] *** Joins: hendursa1 (~weechat@user/hendursaga)
[12:36:44] <Koopz> the problem i'm facing is that mediaTypeSelect defined in Columns.js is available in BetterList.js which imo sounds like asking for trouble
[12:37:48] <electrostatic> Well, I think I might know why, though I haven't seen this before.
[12:38:15] <Koopz> i mean i can't really blame my browser for doing this, after all i'm essentially just telling the browser to load the JS file and well it does execute the code
[12:38:40] <Koopz> and since there's no scoping happening it's there
[12:39:04] <electrostatic> Can you check and see if mediaTypeSelect is accessible in App.js between the imports and the const App {} declaration?

[12:48:52] <electrostatic> I think one of the functions you export in Columns.js likely references mediaTypeSelect, which puts it in the closure scope for const Columns = {
[12:48:52] <electrostatic> getColumns,
[12:48:52] <electrostatic>  initToggles,

[13:18:21] <electrostatic> What's that?
[13:18:42] <Koopz> see, BetterList.js has a function which calls the getColumns() method of my Columns.js by calling App.Columns.getColumns()
[13:18:59] <theskillwithin> ugh
[13:19:55] <Koopz> which actually only works because i wrote window.App = App in the <script> for debugging purposes :D

[20:35:57] <alien_lappy> i found out something weird... there's an array and i did a for (var i in array) {} loop, but i noticed, the i is actually a string and not a number? how strange is this?
[20:37:37] <sillyslux__> !for..in @alien_lappy
[20:37:37] <jellobot> alien_lappy, for..in is not to loop through indices/values of an array. Use for(init;cond;step) or Array#forEach. For..in iterates over *all* enumerable properties of an object, without any defined order. See also !iteration
