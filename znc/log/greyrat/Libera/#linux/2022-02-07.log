[01:43:14] <tirnanog> znf: anyway. it's pretty complicated. the way it works from 5.8 onwards depends on whether hardware-assisted P-states are implemented by your system. if they are not, then you can select the same set of governors that one might use with, say, acpi-cpufreq. so, the "schedutil" governor would more or less approximate what the intel_pstate "performance" governor is doing now. sort of.

[01:45:48] <znf> I hope
[01:45:48] <tirnanog> znf: and I speak from direct experience here ... the intel_pstate performance governor is workoad-sensitive, just as powersave is. it's just tuned to ramp up a bit more promptly. however, if the CPU throttles due to percieved thermal constraints, expect your operating frequency to be curtailed. no amount of governor fiddling would change that. again, not saying it's happening to you, but be mindful
[01:45:50] <tirnanog> of it.
[01:46:11] <znf> tirnanog, yeah, no, I checked, 50°C average across all 40 cores
[01:46:20] <tirnanog> right, ok. in that case, it shouldn't be the reason.
[01:46:26] <znf> shouldn't be a thermal issue

[01:50:24] <znf> yeah, there's a HWE kernel which is newer

[01:54:09] <tirnanog> znf: if you can't update the kernel, the best you can do is go into the firmware settings and choose the "Performance" power management profile. even then, a sub-optimal intel_pstate implementation could continue to be a problem for you.

[05:34:03] <AeroNotix> finding duplicate files is a ... surprisingly interesting problem to solve
[05:34:26] <AeroNotix> https://github.com/AeroNotix/fstdupe the "algorithm" here is pretty much the most optimal I could come up with

[09:55:39] <Gustavo6046> i think some programs have an option to use JPEG compression
[09:55:41] <euouae> is it possible to do it to the pdf itself?
[09:55:49] <bparker> yes with convert
[09:55:49] <euouae> I guess I'll just retake the pictures
[09:55:53] <euouae> oh alright, thanks
[09:55:55] <znf> euouae, https://acrobat.adobe.com/link/acrobat/compress-pdf
[09:55:56] <Gustavo6046> what do you mean to the pdf itself?
[09:55:56] <znf> sure
[09:56:06] <Gustavo6046> if you do it to the pictures inside the pdf, then surely it'll count as the pdf itself, right?
[09:56:12] <Gustavo6046> just confused :p
[09:56:32] <bparker> https://legacy.imagemagick.org/discourse-server/viewtopic.php?t=16609
[09:56:34] <znf> no, a PDF has an internal structure, it keeps the images and the vector (postscript) data separate
[09:56:42] <Gustavo6046> ah
[09:56:54] <Gustavo6046> well, the images are still embedded into the file in some way, right?
[09:56:57] <znf> yes
[09:57:05] <Gustavo6046> so "the PDF" refers to the file or to this internal structure?
[09:57:16] <znf> pretty much, yes
[09:57:31] <Gustavo6046> if a PDF is composed majorly of pictures, then what significant gain is there to be made from compression if not from simply compressing the embedded pictures?
[09:57:47] <pnbeast> euouae, pictures don't typically compress very well, unless they're still bitmaps or something strange like that.  So, a PDF full of pictures also, usually, doesn't compress very well, either.
[09:58:04] <znf> PDF can hold JPG, TIFF and I believe PNG?
[09:58:07] <euouae> yeah perhaps reducing quality is what I had in mind, sorry. I said compress by mistake
[09:58:18] <Gustavo6046> ah, so one way would be to convert between those formats
[09:58:27] <Gustavo6046> euouae, I suppose converting to JPEG counts as reducing quality?
[09:58:28] <mlu> depends on your version of PDF
[09:58:28] <znf> Yes, the other way is to reduce the DPI of the pics
[09:58:29] <pnbeast> Oh, sorry.

[10:47:14] <teelrabbit> pnbeast, fair enough, sorry
[10:47:22] <rouji> $15/h isn't great either
[10:47:23] <KBar> znf i think i was clear? have you ever read ascii(7)?
[10:47:44] <teelrabbit> it was like 10 lines
[10:47:53] <znf> in my >20 years of linux, I have never felt the need to read those docs :)
[10:48:01] <nomagno> Hm.... 15 dollars an hour is actually an extremely good deal. I'll consult with my manager on that types phone number into cat paw
[10:48:04] <MinusOne> 10 lines that take an hour to write?
[10:48:15] <KBar> znf well, congrats. some people do need and actually read them. so maybe the world isnt all about you i guess?
[10:48:41] <KBar> or perhaps we should scrap them since you dont need to read them
[10:48:49] <teelrabbit> 1hr was more of like a time line
[10:48:50] <znf> I think most people these days just use libraries that abstract those concepts :)
[10:49:12] <MinusOne> teelrabbit, why not just ask questions related to the code you are writing and see what happens...
[10:49:21] <KBar> znf that still doesnt answer my question. are you here to brag about your achievements? you could have just skipped the question if you had no idea

[11:56:41] <structoha> there is a single scenario which i still don't really understand, if my vps receives a packet targetting a host in the vpn, and since the openvpn does SNAT, say on interface eth0, linux changes the dest ip and port to the the vpn host, at this point it goes through the forward chain aswell to tun0, when does it go to the openvpn programm to be packed in another ip frame?
[11:57:03] <sheep> when it goes through tun0
[11:57:28] <structoha> sheep: after it is placed on tun0?
[11:57:43] <sheep> yes. openvpn receives every packet sent to tun0
[11:58:02] <structoha> but the routing happens before, right?

[13:10:10] <mlu> yep :)
[13:10:13] <sheep> TCP also doesn't have sockets
[13:10:17] <clarity> That's right,
[13:10:24] <clarity> Sockets are the interface that you use to tell kernel to send and receive data :)

[13:10:47] <hugbubby> So for TCP, 1 socket == 1 connection, usually
[13:10:51] <mlu> is there even such a thing as a UDP socket? or is it more of a one by one type of thing?
[13:11:15] <mlu> I imagine you can listen for packets and you can send packets, but the statelessness doesn't map over to a socket that well

[13:13:40] <Sauvin> I've never trusted UDP because of the waiver "no guaranteed order of packet arrival, or even arrival at all"
[13:14:03] <hugbubby> Sauvin: Well, sometimes that's unnecessary
[13:14:11] <DLange> still good for audio or video data where late arrival wouldn't help anyways
[13:14:14] <hugbubby> Like for the protocol I'm using there's no significance to packet order
[13:14:28] <DLange> so better to have stuff get lost than clog pipes more
[13:14:33] <sheep> also no congestion control or flow control, but you can always use DCCP or RUDP
[13:14:37] <Disconsented> Its useful to implement other things on top of
[13:14:54] <DLange> like this mosh session here for IRC :-)
[13:15:01] <hugbubby> Actually that's not true... There's a little bit of significance, but it's got its own little handshake, so you know when that portion si done and you can fire away

[23:27:44] <Dagmar> Oh wait, you're _exporting that_
[23:27:45] <hexnewbie> hojasuelta: If it turns out Google Voice doesn't use 443, that sounds like anything non-HTTP is not working.

[23:28:45] <clarity> it's terrible that our world allows such terrible isps to exist :<
[23:28:51] <Dagmar> perrierjouet: Basically, the nfsd isn't likely to magically catch on if you remove or insert the thumbdrive _after_ it's been started
[23:28:54] <znf> that's no longer an ISP
[23:29:04] <hojasuelta> hexagoxel: gotcha... yeah, i figure ill ask guys who run the house about A. router and B. isp
[23:29:09] <Dagmar> znf: Yep that's a surveillance network targeting the very stupid
[23:29:11] <djph> clarity: or the connection isn't setup right, or it's a "guest(tm)" network
[23:29:17] <znf> also, there's no reason an ISP would block SSH, so I feel we're not getting the full story here
