[04:04:45] <Grinnz> aquanight: the only other one worth using is ($) because it too has functional parser effects, but it does also lead to confusing users so it's not one i'd recommend generally
[04:05:24] <Grinnz> the functional parser effect is that a ($) function can be used in the middle of a list with a single arg and not slurp up the rest of the args
[04:05:38] <Grinnz> like some builtins do

[13:17:51] <xenu> (yellow)
[13:17:57] <ilmari> UNKNOWN means failed to build

[13:18:46] <ilmari> (I think?)
[13:19:27] <ilmari> not that I understand how it builds _without_ threads, because then USE_THREADS isn't defined at all
[13:20:48] <ilmari> whereas with threads it's #defined to /**/
[13:21:17] <Altreus> gordonfish: figured out that it was actually boolifying it, not stringifying it, and the fallback made it use string overload
[13:21:31] <xenu> ilmari: when a constant is undefined, it value defaults to 0 inside #if

[13:25:16] <Altreus> If a package uses overload, there's no way to only overload the things you provide, is that correct?
[13:25:28] <Altreus> The only way to get other operators is to make use of either fallback or nomethod?
[13:25:46] <LeoNerd> Yeah it's kinda all-or-nothing.. it's a bit annoying
[13:26:03] <Altreus> Would be nice if it came with defaults that reÃ¯mplement what Perl already does
[13:26:22] <Altreus> I suppose bool => sub {1} is kinda always correct though, right
[13:27:20] <LeoNerd> It's rare you ever want an object to appear false
[13:27:52] <LeoNerd> That's usually just for objects which try to behave liked numbers or strings, and the value is zero or empty

[13:54:17] <ilmari> USE_THREADS was meant to be a synonym for USE_5005THREADS until "the sources are revised to use USE_5005THREADS throughout"
[13:54:20] <Paperbot> Link title(s): [ Yet Another CPAN Grep ]
[13:54:21] <xenu> it seems the modules that use USE_THREADS fall into three groups:
[13:54:21] <xenu> - reini's modules which unsurprisingly do that on purpose
[13:54:21] <xenu> - very old code copied from somewhere that also checks perl version in the wrong way

[13:58:48] <xenu> SDL is interesting, apparently it adds -DUSE_THREADS in Build.PL
[13:59:07] <ilmari> which is what lead me to change the definition to match the docs when I removed the 5005 vestiges
[14:01:29] <xenu> ilmari: oh, i see, i guess it was supposed to mean that -Dusethreads and -Duseithreads are synonymouss, but not the C constants
[14:03:02] <ilmari> anyway, enough archaeology, better get back to work

[14:06:19] <xenu> maybe there indeed was a contract that USE_THREADS==USE_5005THREADS but it doesn't seem many people cared about it
[14:06:29] <xenu> and we can't unbreak 5.34 retroactively and the current behaviour is better, so in the end i don't think there's a need to revert anything

[19:35:42] <LeoNerd> I tend to  use VERSION;  these days instead of 'strict'...
[19:35:48] <LeoNerd> And soon it'll do warnings too :)
[19:36:00] <Altreus> unfortunately use v5.14 doesn't have that effect :(
[19:36:31] <LeoNerd> Not warnings, but it does strict
[19:36:57] <thrig> or if you sneak Object::Pad into the test file ...

[19:38:39] <Altreus> oh it does strict? Hmm
[19:38:47] <Altreus> well still, use v5.14; use warnings; looks odd
[19:38:54] <Altreus> what else do I win from that version?
[19:39:02] <thrig> say
[19:39:07] <thrig> state, etc

[19:39:23] <Altreus> no, 5.10 of course
[19:39:23] <thrig> off by one
[19:39:53] <Altreus> I might have to start getting people used to that, especially now that we've got a branch attempting to make it run on 5.32
[19:40:19] <thrig> change is hard
[19:40:42] <Altreus> standing still is harder
[19:41:03] <Altreus> Regina Spektor told us that
[19:47:08] <LeoNerd> The -slight- downside is that technically  use v5.14;  does enable the 'switch' feature, which is the given/when keywords, but at least they'll provoke experimental warnings
[19:47:40] <LeoNerd> We finally got rid of those out of the feature bundle for 5.36, so when that's out that'll be its two main advantages -  use v5.36;  turns on strict+warnings and doesn't turn on given/when
[19:47:54] <thrig> presumably given/when/~~ would be caught during code review, just like gotofail and so forth were
[19:49:03] <Altreus> yeah, definitely - we already did a push to oust those things from the existing code

[19:55:42] <ether> I can never remember the precise differences between use v5.16; and use feature :5.16;
[19:56:16] <LeoNerd> The former also turns on strict
[19:56:23] <LeoNerd> use VERSION = strict + feature bundle
[19:56:38] <LeoNerd> And as of 5.36, it'll be strict + warnings + feature bundle
[19:57:10] <thrig> call now, and we'll throw in a salad spinner, free!
[19:57:11] <LeoNerd> Basically,  use VERSION  is the thing you should actually be using... the various other bits and pieces are the components it is composed of
[19:58:46] <ilmari> strict is only enabled by `use v5.12;` and later
[19:59:21] <LeoNerd> Well,.. Yah :) I tend to gloss over that fact because in practice nobody is going to "use VERSION" a version lower than 5.12 these days
[19:59:57] <LeoNerd> Oh.. and tiny headsup: it's fairly likely we'll think about having some future version start enabling some 'std' functions or whatever namespace we call them
[20:00:13] <thrig> mst, and now std?
[20:00:20] <LeoNerd> So maybe  use v5.38  will also turn on 'refaddr, reftype, weaken,...' from whatever that namespace becomes
[20:00:43] <LeoNerd> Name is still undecided. There aren't (in my mind) any candidates I'm sufficiently happy with
[20:00:53] <LeoNerd> "use builtins" well, no they're not builtin. We have to ask for them
[20:01:05] <thrig> use more ...
[20:01:10] <LeoNerd> "use functions" ... Imean, yes.. but surely almost -anything- that you "use" is a function. What makes these special
[20:01:22] <LeoNerd> Hah.. more.pm already exists; it just inverts the logic of  use less
[20:01:22] <ether> agreed
[20:01:31] <thrig> darn
[20:01:48] <LeoNerd> no more 'cpu' === use less 'cpu';
[20:02:30] <ilmari> there's also a fewer.pm, for grammar pedants
[20:02:43] <ilmari> use fewer 'cores';
[20:03:11] <LeoNerd> ilmari: Grammar pedants? Who might they be? Have you ever met any? ;)
[20:03:26] <thrig> in computing? no
[20:04:15] <LeoNerd> Hrm.. today's task: debugging that most awkward of unit-test failures. A test that checks that a thing happens, didn't happen.
[20:04:31] <LeoNerd> It's so much harder to work out why a thing doesn't happen. If it just happened in the wrong way, I could easily trace it.

[22:26:52] <gordonfish> LeoNerd: Why not have them in separate compat.h/compat.c and have them only included in macro perl version checks?
[22:29:55] <LeoNerd> Oh that wouldn't work. The wrapepr function stuff has to be included in -any- perl version anyway, so users could write code that still works on infix-enabled perls
[22:31:33] <gordonfish> LeoNerd: Maybe I'm misunderstanding. You said "wrapper functions around them for perls without PL_infix_plugin", so logically those would only needed on perls that lack PL_infix_plugin, right?
[22:32:07] <LeoNerd> No
[22:32:41] <LeoNerd> E.g. Syntax::Operator::Equ provides an is_strequ() wrapper function. That means you can call it like  is_strequ( $x, $y )
[22:32:56] <LeoNerd> Such syntax works in any perl 5.14 onwards. Even in perls _with_ PL_infix_plugin
[22:33:05] <LeoNerd> So you could put that in a regular CPAN module and have it work -everywhere-
[22:33:23] <LeoNerd> So the code to make these wrapper functions exist, has to be included on all versions. Including those enhanced ones
[22:34:10] <gordonfish> Oh I see
