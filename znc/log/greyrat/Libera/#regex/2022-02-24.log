[13:46:51] <M3r> isnt that the meaning of an atomic group?

[13:54:53] <re101-dog-86> abc234(ab bn bnn jii). How can I extract the string to the left of parenthesis..? Here "abc234"
[13:55:26] <M3r> would you prefer it captured as a named group?
[13:55:56] <re101-dog-86> what is named group..?
[13:56:07] <re101-dog-86> i didnt have much idea
[13:58:01] <M3r> so you can tell the regex to output the results to named groups of matching queries
[13:58:36] <M3r> so instead of getting a match #1 and match #2  you'd get a group called part1 and second as part2 etc
[13:59:01] <M3r> I'll go head and create a named capture for these two strings, and we'll see then if you'll find it usefull
[13:59:14] <re101-dog-86> okay
[13:59:31] <M3r> unfortunately, sorry... I have a meeting starting soon. I'll ping you afterwards.

[14:15:55] <M3r> how's it working re101-dog-86?
[14:15:56] <purplex> yours had a context attached this time rather than just matching any ( ) and i was thinking about that too. I think I was trying to just provide an improved version of your previous attempts to match ( ).
[14:17:22] <re101-dog-86> its working
[14:17:45] <M3r> Good to hear.

[14:56:50] <purplex> depends on goal, Treet
[14:58:01] <Treet> i want to replace it with nothing ... like UU random text .com should dissappear :x
[14:59:05] <M3r> random text should disappear?
[14:59:25] <Treet> no.. completey
[14:59:28] <purplex> is it part of the larger text?
[14:59:52] <M3r> from: UU random text .com

[15:03:45] <purplex> okay, so you wanted to select a part of text and remove it. It'll work then
[15:04:31] <M3r> I'd say UU\s([\w\s]+)\.com
[15:05:19] <M3r> if its random text (no special characters except _ )
[15:05:19] <purplex> not bad :p
[15:05:54] <M3r> the group isn't needed tho

[15:06:16] <purplex> yep
[15:06:25] <re101-dog-86> \(([^\)]*)\)" this expression didnt return exact string in c#, when i using comma instead of space
[15:06:27] <purplex> now you see it
[15:06:41] <Treet> hmm.. downt work M3r
[15:07:31] <M3r> doesnt? hmm... UU\s[\w\s]+?\.com
[15:08:00] <M3r> it will select UU random text .com from "this is string UU random text .com that will be the result"
[15:08:03] <purplex> dog: where's that comma?
[15:08:22] <re101-dog-86> abc(a,b,c)
