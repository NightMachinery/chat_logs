[00:39:28] <gwozniak> One side effect of it could be that we get rid of some real old thing that no one really likes but changing it has never been worth the effort
[00:39:40] <gwozniak> It may now be worth the effort

[02:34:02] <jjuran> What's next, money donated to the build-the-wall fund didn't go to building the wall?
[02:37:53] <jjuran> So, the story subject didn't even care about mandates per se, but just was sad about not getting to see a friend dying in a hospital
[02:47:37] <kline> i mean, on one hand this is a really good example of how the authorities have failed to engage with people who have more acutely suffered from the effects of lockdown
[02:47:58] <kline> (on the other, lol giving all your money to angry antivaxxers who you dont even really agree with)
[02:49:38] <kline> i think the govt, at least in the uk, has done poorly at public messaging generally, and particularly badly at any demographic thats not the lowest hanging fruit white middle-class generally least affected person, and thats having consequences like this
[03:05:40] <skyl4rk> The inability to visit a dying loved one in hospital strikes me as particularly horrible, I wonder how things would be different if that need had been possible to accomodate. With not enough PPE stock to even keep doctors and nurses protected I realize it's a pipedream, but as it is with dreams, one can.

[05:16:57] <indigo> Same thing with going into the ER, your loved one can't even wait with you in the waiting room, they have to wait outside
[05:24:35] <gwozniak> Worth noting that his friend died in June 2020 when there was basically no chance of ever getting in to see people in hospitals
[05:24:55] <gwozniak> So many questions from that story, though
[05:27:14] <companion_cube> damn, the guy's accounts are still frozen? that's fucked up
[05:29:31] <gwozniak> I mean, it's a bit fucked up, but remember they were given lots of warning about the hammer coming down
[05:33:57] <companion_cube> the hammer of expulsion, sure
[05:34:11] <kline> not really sure what the value in unfreezing his accounts would be given he claims to have given it all away anyway
[05:34:53] <gwozniak> Yeah, the narrative of the story is that he gave everything away and assumed it would be paid back to him
[05:36:48] <companion_cube> :D
[05:37:05] <companion_cube> kline: he might still have a few grands, right?
[05:37:22] <companion_cube> "giving it all away" is generally a bit exagerated
[05:37:35] <kline> probably the bigger issue is not being able to get paid
[05:37:49] <kline> where do they send the salary
[05:38:10] <kline> and opening a new account to evade this is probably a good way to catch even bigger penalties

[06:01:43] <gwozniak> Another oddity: being kicked out of his apartment for his "point of view".  Seems *really* suspect
[06:02:52] <gwozniak> More than likely he couldn't pay his rent.  Even then, it's generally pretty hard to get officially evicted in most places (at least in Ontario)
[06:03:11] <gwozniak> I don't know if BC is a lot different, but I'd be surprised if it was
[06:03:30] <gwozniak> I think there's a lot more going on here than what this story is letting on
[06:05:25] <gwozniak> Totally shutting down your business and moving out for the convoy?  How big was that business?  Couldn't have been large.  And it's a web one, so is remote not an option?
[06:06:05] <gwozniak> It's all pretty weird and under-explored here

[14:14:03] <pja> To be fair, the problem with Haskell is that’s it’s very easy to create a small DSL to do what you want, but simultaneously v.tempting to pull in the full Haskell system into the same DSL just to solve that one edge case.
[14:14:36] <pja> Which leads to little languages that are, at one & the same time, v. simle & wildly over-complex for the problem domain.
[14:14:57] <pja> The naïve Haskell programmer doesn’t see it this way of course, but their users certainly do...
