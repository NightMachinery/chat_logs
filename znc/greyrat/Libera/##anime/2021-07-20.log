[02:15:03] <MootPoot> gotta use that camera
[02:15:06] <davic> ye
[02:15:08] <Matt|home> there are pretty severe local laws here regarding filming minors (yes i know she's not a minor), but im pretty sure privacy violations are a federal thing
[02:15:15] <davic> MootPoot: but why film it at that point
[02:15:18] <davic> Just livestream it
[02:15:26] <davic> wait
[02:15:32] <Matt|home> i dont know what she was flipping out about, but anger over being filmed is justified imo

[02:15:58] <Bco1981> lol
[02:16:20] <Matt|home> In most states where taping someone who hasn't consented to the recording is illegal, the recorded person can sue the individual doing the recording. Damages are available to a person who wins such a civil lawsuit.
[02:16:25] <Matt|home> yeah that includes video taping. 
[02:16:33] <MootPoot>  what
[02:16:36] <MootPoot> nahhh
[02:16:43] <MootPoot> in private property sure
[02:16:45] <Matt|home> you _can_ record public officials or police in cali and florida

[02:16:47] <Matt|home> yes
[02:16:50] <Matt|home> even on public property
[02:16:52] <Bco1981> sue... the answer to all your problems...
[02:16:59] <Matt|home> you cannot record other individuals without their consent unless they are public officials
[02:16:59] <MootPoot> its illegal for me to just walk around with a camera on record?
[02:17:16] <mixfix41> its game changer to record karens
[02:17:19] <Matt|home> obviously most people won't give a shit, but you could absolutely be subject to legal action. famous people do it ALL the time
[02:17:32] <mixfix41> im not sure the rant is about esp about the karen video

[02:18:14] <Bco1981> why have it in public
[02:18:20] <Matt|home> ...
[02:18:20] <Bco1981> go some where privte
[02:18:39] <Matt|home> because some people have trouble controlling their emotions or might be dealing with issues that they feel they have no answer or control over?
[02:18:49] <Matt|home> that's like telling me after shitting my pants "how fucking dare you"
[02:18:49] <mixfix41> fuck that bitch i wouldnt sympathize 
[02:18:56] <Matt|home> and that is precisely the problem today

[02:19:18] <davic> Which is what it should be
[02:19:36] <Matt|home> but breaking down crying, being filmed, and then told "fuck you" is not a measured response . or helpful.

[11:36:28] <JesseDesu> i dont get it
[11:37:31] <Cryowolf> if a person claiming to be a demon appeared out of sight in your room without warning and introduced himself he then says he can give you whatever you want within the realms of reality. But depending on the weight of your wish, you'd have to give up an equal weight of your soul. Would you take the chance this is just some random asshat, or if it rteally is a demon. Wld you take the chance that your wish demands very little weight of 
[11:37:31] <Cryowolf> your soul?s So that after death you'd be allowed into "heaven" assuming they let damaged souls in and don't  just throw them in purgatory.

[17:28:57] <HubertFarnsworth> Sadale: I have consulted with my bank guy and investing some of the funds in mutual funds
[17:29:10] <Sadale> HubertFarnsworth, cool. aww.
[17:29:32] <Sadale> HubertFarnsworth, those bank guy just love to take comissions. Most of them are only as good as managing funds as yourself. :P
[17:29:40] <Sadale> Some of them are real good tho. But they're rare.
[17:29:43] <HubertFarnsworth> which country druglady? every country is neighboring country to some country
[17:30:03] <TsundereNoises> druglady: yes, thank you for being technically correct but I still feel like I answered the question
[17:30:36] <TsundereNoises> HubertFarnsworth: she's being pedantic about the meaning of the word alien
[17:30:44] <HubertFarnsworth> Sadale: I think that is also part of his job. He is manager of my bank.
[17:31:06] <Sadale> HubertFarnsworth, I mean you could manage the investment on your own
[17:31:15] <Sadale> This'd save you the comissions fee.
[17:31:34] <Sadale> HubertFarnsworth, I find it interesting that you've got a manager for your bank account tho. I don't have it
[17:31:48] <HubertFarnsworth> Sadale: You misunderstood. I asked him for suggestions and I am investing.
[17:32:04] <Sadale> oh
[17:32:12] <Sadale> HubertFarnsworth, oh I get your idea.
[17:32:13] <HubertFarnsworth> HubertFarnsworth: manager of the branch where I have account

[17:32:36] <Sadale> wait. let me read again
[17:33:00] <Sadale> HubertFarnsworth, ah. I got it. Hopefully you could make profit off it :3

[17:34:40] <Sadale> I dont think so
[17:34:48] <Sadale> I don't think it's guaranteed.
[17:35:06] <Sadale> deposit is guaranteed as long as the bank doesn't go bankrupt. mutual fund comes with a risk.
[17:35:24] <HubertFarnsworth> Sadale: I mean it's mutual funds, it isn't like futures or etfs
[17:35:31] <Sadale> huh?
[17:35:39] <Sadale> Doesn't mutual fund have risk of dropping as well?
[17:35:47] <Sadale> It just drop less, doesn't it?
[17:35:54] <HubertFarnsworth> Sadale: yeah
[17:36:35] <HubertFarnsworth> Sadale: it takes time profits are guranteed unless one is in pinch for money
[17:37:26] <Sadale> ah. That still isn't guaranteed, but more like "highly likely". Just like the stock market. Profit is highly likely if you're putting the money there and sit around for long enough

[17:43:39] <spoonm> yeah,
[17:43:43] <HubertFarnsworth> ah
[17:44:02] <spoonm> I was doing compsci up until a few years ago, and then since I had to change universities I decided to go for abstract maths instead
[17:44:32] <HubertFarnsworth> spoonm: I don't know if you can get experience certificate or something on paper, you could put it up on your cv
[17:44:48] <Sadale> spoonm, I wonder how you could take a job while studying tho
[17:44:54] <Sadale> spoonm, part time studying?
[17:45:09] <spoonm> here we have something called CLT (consolidação das leis do trabalho), which is how full time employment works, and it awards plenty of benefits, including a 13th salary at the end of the year and paid leave
[17:45:15] <spoonm> this job is my first CLT job
[17:45:56] <spoonm> Sadale: I wonder about that myself, so I'll be careful this semester
[17:46:19] <spoonm> HubertFarnsworth: that's what I'll be doing
[17:46:21] <Sadale> cool!
[17:46:21] <HubertFarnsworth> I see. I guess no six months appraisal spoonm?
[17:46:38] <Sadale> spoonm, don't stop looking for jobs tho. There could be a better opportunity waiting for you. :P
[17:46:44] <spoonm> it's three months appraisal here, HubertFarnsworth 
[17:46:48] <Sadale> i.e. it may pay better :P
[17:46:48] <spoonm> or "probation"
[17:47:17] <HubertFarnsworth> damn spoonm, 3 months is too short
[17:47:20] <spoonm> I will, but I'm happy I'm even hired
[17:47:25] <HubertFarnsworth> it would just pass like that
[17:47:28] <spoonm> HubertFarnsworth: it's how we do it here
[17:47:45] <spoonm> if after 3 months the company isn't happy with your performance, you're let go
[17:48:16] <HubertFarnsworth> heh
[17:48:44] <HubertFarnsworth> the thing about job is they always get more work out of you then they pay
[17:49:01] <HubertFarnsworth> especially in IT, they make lot more from their employees
[17:49:10] <HubertFarnsworth> real estate is nothing before that
[17:49:45] <Publios> spoonm,  that's pretty normal
[17:49:51] <TsundereNoises> I mean if they paid you exactly the value of your work they would, by definition, make no money

Then I got into the sex toy company for a week, left and joined a router company. Now I'm working for a water dispenser company.
[17:57:36] <Sadale> HubertFarnsworth, of course I left because it pays better =P

[18:01:09] <Sadale> HubertFarnsworth, firmware dev
[18:01:18] <HubertFarnsworth> ah
[18:07:41] <Sadale> Basically I have always been a firmware dev. The market is small. But it exists. So I'm making a profit off it :P
[18:08:02] <Sadale> It's difficult for me to look for a job. But it's just as difficult for the employers to hire a firwmare developer.
[18:08:32] <Sadale> uhm, actually it hasn't been difficult for me to look for a job so far. Maybe I quoted for too low :P
[18:11:56] <Sadale> HubertFarnsworth, I wonder how's the tech market there. Apparently the salary range here's huge.
[18:12:44] <Sadale> For the pay as a programmer or people in tech sector, I suspect that it's more about luck and skill here.
[18:12:50] <Sadale> For the pay as a programmer or people in tech sector, I suspect that it's more about luck than* skill here.
[18:14:38] <HubertFarnsworth> Sadale: I wonder. I think it is their background and expectation from the people they hire
[18:15:30] <TsundereNoises> employment in general is a lot more about luck than people like to admit
[18:16:00] <TsundereNoises> lots of people fail upwards, lots of competent people never get anywhere
[18:16:14] <Sadale> sad
[18:16:26] <Sadale> I wonder if getting "upward" means better pay tho.
[18:16:40] <Sadale> Just because you get promoted doesn't mean that you get paid more, no?
[18:16:43] <TsundereNoises> one of the most frustrating things is how people like to convince themselves that the end results are all due to individual merit
[18:17:01] <TsundereNoises> Sadale: at least in the US in generally does, few people get promoted without getting a pay raise
[18:17:10] <Sadale> I see.
[18:17:23] <Sadale> I've no idea on the market here. I don't know enough people IRL to be able to tell :(
[18:17:46] <Sadale> The general preception is that getting promoted to higher up would get you better pay. But I'm not so sure if that's real.
[18:18:22] <Sadale> That's because I've seen companies hiring CTO positions that paid shit.
[18:18:59] <ButterNoodle> how much?
[18:19:51] <ButterNoodle> yo TsundereNoises 
[18:19:53] <ButterNoodle> btw
[18:20:17] <Sadale> I think it was like HK$25000 per month. That's US$38k per year. Keep in mind that the living cost here is lower than the US tho.
[18:20:49] <ButterNoodle> still
[18:20:52] <ButterNoodle> cto?
[18:21:35] <ButterNoodle> those are $250K +options.. minimum here.. I mean ig it depends on industry and company revenue..
[18:22:09] <Sadale> ButterNoodle, I suspect that those companies just want to hire people who join for the title.

[18:25:40] <HubertFarnsworth> having a masters is automatic salary hike
[18:26:03] <Sadale> HubertFarnsworth, I really depends on the company. Thruout my career the only company that prefer a master degree is the first company that I worked for
[18:26:15] <HubertFarnsworth> not automatic but most likely
[18:26:23] <Sadale> Oh. As for the funding of startup the government funds more for master degree holders.
[18:26:49] <HubertFarnsworth> I see.

[18:29:27] <Sadale> Most often you're only paid as little as the boss could get away with :(
[18:29:43] <HubertFarnsworth> yeah
[18:29:54] <Sadale> I'm very glad that I've learned that in the early days of my career.
[18:30:08] <Sadale> All thanks to the first company I worked for paid absolute shit. xD
[18:30:23] <Sadale> And had terrible culture. Adding them up there's literally no reason for me to work there
[18:31:11] <Sadale> HubertFarnsworth, you're your own boss tho :P
[18:31:27] <Sadale> HubertFarnsworth, you rich. :3

[18:33:02] <amigojapan> Nyanpasu- HubertFarnsworth o/
[18:33:27] <amigojapan> HubertFarnsworth: I watched the first season of konosuba
[18:33:49] <TsundereNoises> good morning amigojapan
[18:34:09] <HubertFarnsworth> Sadale: I am not rich though I don't have much expenses because of cheap cost of living.
[18:34:09] <amigojapan> Good evening TsundereNoises 
[18:34:21] <HubertFarnsworth> Sadale: now I am not even making any money
[18:34:23] <Sadale> HubertFarnsworth, I see. The living cost there are indeed cheap
[18:34:29] <Sadale> HubertFarnsworth, sad :(
[18:34:36] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: I finished watching the first season of konosuba with tomako
[18:34:44] <HubertFarnsworth> Sadale: My money is at work though :p
[18:34:51] <Sadale> HubertFarnsworth, maybe you could beg dfch for money tho
[18:35:13] <HubertFarnsworth> dfch is quite rich, isn't he?
[18:35:19] <Sadale> HubertFarnsworth, Or even Nanobot. Nanobot'll soon to be rich after selling of of his BTC.
[18:35:20] <HubertFarnsworth> nice amigojapan 
[18:35:25] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: there's an OVA between seasons 1 and 2
[18:35:36] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: the OVA is good, and it's actually kind of relevant?
[18:35:48] <HubertFarnsworth> yeah Sadale, Nanobot can retire comfortably in America.
[18:36:02] <Sadale> me jelly :(
[18:36:04] <Sadale> so jelly
[18:36:06] <Urchin[emacs]> hi TsundereNoises 
[18:36:12] <Sadale> Urchin[emacs], nya~ :3

[18:36:51] <ButterNoodle> woah hi druglady 
[18:37:02] <ButterNoodle> u get my laters :3
[18:37:05] <HubertFarnsworth> Sadale: I wonder if you can still apply for asylum.
[18:37:05] <druglady> woah hello ButterNoodle
[18:37:42] <Sadale> HubertFarnsworth, Again I don't want to exploit asylum
[18:37:58] <HubertFarnsworth> amigojapan: Did Tomako san also watch Konosuba?
[18:38:02] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: is that the movie?
[18:38:13] <ButterNoodle> naa
[18:38:17] <ButterNoodle> its different
[18:38:17] <amigojapan> Yes HubertFarnsworth she liked it
[18:38:22] <ButterNoodle> little side sauce
[18:38:42] <HubertFarnsworth> nice amigojapan, it is a surprise that you like konosuba
[18:38:43] <Sadale> HubertFarnsworth, And the situation here in Hong Kong is nowhere as bad as those pro-democracy people said at all. One can live comfortably here. Those people are just being extreme and get pissed over literally anything. :/
[18:38:47] <amigojapan> I see ButterNoodle 
[18:39:03] <amigojapan> HubertFarnsworth: it was funny
[18:40:02] <HubertFarnsworth> Sadale: well...anyway, will you join Davic in PH?
[18:40:03] <TsundereNoises> !later tell Bco1981 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFj7CBzqqs0
[18:40:20] <TsundereNoises> hi Urchin[emacs]
[18:40:44] <Sadale> HubertFarnsworth, And I'm not involved in activism of any kind, nor I'm interested in joining any at all. So I don't think I'd even be considered for asylum.
[18:40:50] <Sadale> HubertFarnsworth, possibly.
[18:41:17] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: no, I'm pretty sure the movie is a sequel to the 2nd season (which ALSO has an OVA)
[18:41:39] <amigojapan> I see TsundereNoises 
[18:41:53] <Sadale> HubertFarnsworth, I think that if I ended up saving up enough money, it'll either be PH for me or learn Spanish and go South America.
[18:42:21] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: but there's a season 1 OVA (and I think it might have been the first episode with one of my favorite characters)
[18:42:45] <HubertFarnsworth> Sadale: which country in South America?
[18:43:02] <Sadale> HubertFarnsworth, I'm actually a bit worried about the natural disasters on PH tho. But PH is indeed rather convinient to me because it's close to me, and they speak English
[18:43:04] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: I think I may have watch it. But I am not sure
[18:43:30] <Sadale> HubertFarnsworth, most importantly they offer inexpensive retirement visa so that I could be a NEET there
[18:43:31] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: "While exploring Wiz's magic shop with his party, Kazuma Satou finds a magical wish-granting choker and decides to try it on. Only then does Wiz tell him that the choker strangles its wearer to death in four days unless their desires are fulfilled."
[18:43:51] <HubertFarnsworth> Sadale: recently a volcano has erupted in PH 
[18:44:23] <amigojapan> Yeah I watched that TsundereNoises 
[18:44:47] <Sadale> HubertFarnsworth, not sure which south american country to move to yet. From the info I've looked into so far, quite a few countries there have low living cost, and offer inexpensive stay visa
[18:44:51] <Sadale> HubertFarnsworth, sad
[18:45:29] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: is konosuba a Harlem show?
[18:46:42] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: no, I'm pretty sure it's set in a fantasy world, not Harlem
[18:46:49] <ButterNoodle> druglady.. u wanna do some ibuprofen with me and watch Kuro gyaru ni natta?
[18:46:54] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: just because there's a lot of theft going on, it's not nice to stereotype
[18:47:14] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: hàrem*
[18:47:37] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: more seriously I'd say yes it is obviously
[18:47:49] <TsundereNoises> it just seems less bad because it's less badly written
[18:48:10] <druglady> ButterNoodle, take it with you? no, I feel no pain right now
[18:48:12] <Sadale> HubertFarnsworth, Still, despite the disasters there in PH, there're still quite a few active PH users here. So it shouldn't be that bad :P
[18:48:15] <amigojapan> Ok I think this is the first harem show I have watched
[18:48:16] <HubertFarnsworth> Sadale: natural disasters like volcanoes are rare but things like floods will be more common in coming years I guess
[18:48:23] <Sadale> ouch
[18:48:33] <Sadale> PH is a nation of islands
[18:48:36] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: that's surprising, I thought for sure you'd seen others
[18:48:40] <druglady> will I be in pain after watching whatever Kuro gyaru ni natta is?
[18:48:54] <Sadale> water rise. flood comes.
[18:49:24] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: I usually avoid it is it has the tag "harem
[18:49:29] <HubertFarnsworth> and rains man, rains
[18:50:22] <Sadale> harem anime isn't bad at all :3

[18:54:17] <TsundereNoises> 月語は難しい
[18:54:29] <Sadale> I think TsundereNoises said moonrune's difficult
[18:54:36] * Sadale can read kanji because he's Chinese
[18:56:04] <TsundereNoises> Sadale: yes, knowing chinese is basically a superpower for learning moon language I guess
[18:56:22] <Sadale> Still I'm too lazy to learn moon language
[18:56:39] <Sadale> If I had the time I'd rather to learn Spanish than Japanese.

[18:56:47] <TsundereNoises> Sadale: eww, spanish
[18:57:05] <TsundereNoises> Sadale: everyone wants to learn spanish and it's like… 10th on the list of languages I'd learn, I'd never get to it
[18:57:07] <Sadale> Because Spanish means low cost retirement. I'd learn it for the utility value :P
[18:57:23] <TsundereNoises> Sadale: honestly Chinese is higher than Spanish for me, and I'm not especially motivated to learn Chinese
[18:57:43] <Sadale> The living cost in those south american countries are low. And quite a few of these country offer low cost stay visa.
[18:57:44] <Bco1981> atleast they have a soft landing
[18:58:13] <Sadale> TsundereNoises, I see. Weird. Spanish has the most native speakers in the world. Interesting how you put Chinese higher than spanish
[18:58:31] <TsundereNoises> Sadale: I feel like my desire to learn a language is purely related to how much I want to consume their media multiplied by how much interesting media goes untranslated
[18:58:32] <Sadale> TsundereNoises, lucky you. You got the kanji part. It helps for learning CHinese
[18:58:46] <Sadale> ah
[18:58:51] <TsundereNoises> Sadale: I mean, eventually, I only sorta have the kanji part now
[18:59:03] <TsundereNoises> Sadale: but y'all have some good movies, and good scifi sometimes
[18:59:28] <Sadale> I learned toki pona partly for socializing with other toki pona speakers. And it's easy to learn. Perfect for lazy learners like me. :P
[18:59:37] <TsundereNoises> but yeah, total number of native speakers always seems like a meaningless metric to me, because how many people do I want to talk to?
[18:59:39] <Sadale> TsundereNoises, I see. I don't want movies
[19:00:02] <TsundereNoises> there are more than enough native speakers of ANY language to talk to if you want, and lots of native Spanish (or Chinese) speakers are people you'll never encounter
[19:00:27] <TsundereNoises> Sadale: I watch lots of movies from lots of countries
[19:00:32] <Sadale> aw
[19:01:20] <TsundereNoises> I guess the native speaker argument breaks down for learning Welsh or something, there might NOT actually be anyone worth talking to who speaks Welsh 
[19:01:45] <ButterNoodle> lol
[19:01:54] <Sadale> To me tho it's more about the number of countries using it as an official language and that the people in that country is actually using it.
[19:02:12] <Sadale> I'm just trying to figure out how to retire frugally. :p
[19:02:30] <TsundereNoises> Sadale: well if it's about retirement and vacationing, I guess I'd bump Italian to the top of my list
[19:02:38] <spoonm> I like coconut water
[19:02:41] <TsundereNoises> Sadale: I do want to visit Japan one day, but yeah I know that's not cheap
[19:02:48] <Sadale> hmm why? Is that cheap there in Italy? The living cost
[19:03:20] *** Joins: Tazmainian (~Tazmainia@41.193.169.28)
[19:03:28] <TsundereNoises> it's relatively cheap anyway, not as cheap as south america
[19:03:30] <Sadale> TsundereNoises, Do let me know when you visit. Perhaps I could join. Or you could make a stop at Hong Kong SAR, China during your trip then we can have a meetup :3
[19:03:37] <TsundereNoises> but better than some places I believe
[19:03:39] <Sadale> spoonm, cool! What else do you like?
[19:03:42] <TsundereNoises> and I'd much rather live in Italy
[19:03:59] <Sadale> ah. makes sense for people who cares about real life
[19:04:16] <TsundereNoises> Sadale: yeah I'll probably mention it in here whenever I do, I'd have to meet up with amigojapan if nothing else, and sometimes other #anime people visit each other
[19:04:17] <Sadale> I just care about my internet life so my real life hardly matters as long as I've got food on the table and decent internet access.
[19:04:37] <Sadale> TsundereNoises, I've met davic and dfch :3
[19:04:52] <Sadale> TsundereNoises, oh. and Terminus with his girlfriend as well.
[19:04:59] <TsundereNoises> I've never met anyone, although some day maybe I will
[19:05:04] <Sadale> TsundereNoises, booooooooooo
[19:05:11] <Sadale> Sadale 3 - 0 TsundereNoises
[19:05:14] <TsundereNoises> I mean ButterNoodle and Emmeka aren't too far from me realy
[19:05:21] <TsundereNoises> and someone else I think
[19:05:34] <Sadale> go! go meet them! :D
[19:05:39] <Sadale> And have your kidney stolen
[19:06:03] <spoonm> Sadale: fried chicken
[19:06:18] <TsundereNoises> Sadale: ah, THAT'S why you want to lure me to HK
[19:06:19] <Sadale> spoonm, I like fired chicken as well. The one in KFC :3
[19:06:30] <Sadale> TsundereNoises, haha exactly :3
[19:07:06] <TsundereNoises> Sadale: but yeah, I think the number of interesting books published in a language is really my biggest factor
[19:07:17] <Sadale> I see.
[19:07:32] <TsundereNoises> obviously population can play into that, but some countries just write a lot of interesting stuff (Japan, France)
[19:07:44] <Sadale> My imouto knows a bit Japanese as well. She's interested mainly because it'd enable her to access Japanese content
[19:08:17] <TsundereNoises> yeah there's just so much STUFF in japanese, despite only being one country
[19:08:51] <Sadale> Thanks to anime :P
[19:08:54] <Sadale> All thanks to anime
[19:08:58] <Sadale> and manga
[19:09:23] <Bco1981> yeah she knows, baka, aho, urusai shiranai and hentai
[19:09:46] <Sadale> lol
[19:09:59] <Sadale> I think she knows more than that. I'm not sure how much exactly she knows tho.

[19:10:50] <Sadale> Once I was playing a short vid found on /r/anime and it's talking about selecting swimsuits. And my imouto spotted that without looking at my screen and called me hentai :/
[19:11:11] <Sadale> TsundereNoises, lol
[19:11:41] <TsundereNoises> I mean swimsuit isn't too hard a word, I don't think that tells us much more than urusai
[19:11:51] <TsundereNoises> 水着
[19:11:58] <TsundereNoises> is it the same in chinese?
[19:12:28] <TsundereNoises> I mean, obviously pronunciation would be different
[19:12:44] <TsundereNoises> mizugi
[19:12:59] <Sadale> TsundereNoises, nope. It's different here.
[19:13:06] <Sadale> damn I need to fix my Chinese input method
[19:13:10] <Sadale> It's broken
[19:13:33] <TsundereNoises> somehow my keyboard switching hotkey broke itself, input still works but I have to click it now
[19:13:41] <TsundereNoises> it's weird how those things happen
[19:14:01] <TsundereNoises> some update fucked with something 
[19:15:04] <Bco1981> "some update fucked with something"
[19:15:27] <Bco1981> and people look weird at me, when i tell them, i don't update.
[19:19:08] <Sadale> Fixed.
[19:19:17] <Sadale> TsundereNoises, Here it is in Cantonese: 泳衣
[19:19:35] *** Quits: gargus (~user@60-242-110-27.tpgi.com.au) (Quit: Leaving)
[19:19:44] <Sadale> TsundereNoises, same goes for Chinese
[19:20:26] <TsundereNoises> Sadale: I mean I guess that isn't too bad, "swim clothes"
[19:20:40] <TsundereNoises> vs water
[19:20:45] <Sadale> yep. You can actually read that with your kanji knowledge
[19:20:59] <Sadale> The Japanese one would be "water wear/wearing" in Chinese
[19:21:09] <Sadale> 着 is a verb here.
[19:21:35] <Sadale> oh. Actually 着 is a verb for "wear" in Cantonese. In Chinese (Mandarin) that'd be 穿.
[19:23:21] <TsundereNoises> Sadale: I think in japanese both mean clothes but in different words, like 衣 is in yukata or locker room or like a fancier word for clothes I think? but 着 is most of the individual clothes items you normally talk about, jackets, swimsuits, underwear, 
[19:23:26] <TsundereNoises> also it can me "to arrive"
[19:23:57] <TsundereNoises> 着く
[19:23:58] <Sadale> ah. Here 衣 is the noun for clothes.
[19:24:13] <Bco1981> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWjrwgMm1mc
[19:24:14] <ImoutoBot> [youtube] What's this red dot do? | Duration: 13 seconds
[19:24:49] <Sadale> TsundereNoises, 着 often doesn't mean to arrive in Chinese. There're rare exceptions tho. For example, 着陸 means to land.
[19:25:01] <TsundereNoises> japanese seems to have a lot of 2 kanji for the same thing, but one is a bit fancier or has some extra nuance
[19:25:03] <Sadale> to land as in landing.
[19:25:08] <Sadale> like airplane or rocket landing
[19:25:39] <Sadale> I see. In Cantonese we call clothes 衫 as well. So it's 衫 or 衣. 衣 sounds more formal to me.
[19:26:09] *** Quits: druglady (~darkwitch@user/darkwitch) (Quit: Leaving)
[19:26:45] <Sadale> TsundereNoises, hey you do know quite a bit of kanji, right? :P
[19:27:11] <TsundereNoises> Sadale: I mean, I know more than some people who are just learning but also much less than I need to know
[19:27:17] <Sadale> ah
[19:27:26] <TsundereNoises> Sadale: I've focussed on kanji more than some learners I think, but I'm not that good
[19:27:26] <Sadale> only if you speak Chinese
[19:27:33] <TsundereNoises> Sadale: but I'll get there!
[19:27:33] <Sadale> I see.
[19:27:39] <Sadale> good luck TsundereNoises :3
[19:27:58] <TsundereNoises> Sadale: since my goal is mostly for the purpose of reading things, i've tended to prioritize reading
[19:29:36] <Sadale> TsundereNoises, cool! :3
[19:30:13] <Sadale> TsundereNoises, you're kind of lucky that you've learned English automatically by exposure. Otherwise you'd have to spend extra effort on learning an extra language
[19:30:26] <Sadale> Just like I do. English's difficult af :/
[19:30:36] <Sadale> Especially for the verbal one.
[19:30:54] <Sadale> aww I'm sleepy. I thinkk I have to sleep
[19:30:54] <TsundereNoises> Sadale: yeah, English is terrible, I'm glad I don't have to learn it
[19:30:58] <TsundereNoises> good night Sadale
[19:31:06] <Sadale> nite~ :3
[19:31:22] <Sadale> Makes me wonder if Spanish's any easier
[19:31:48] <TsundereNoises> ask amigojapan
[19:32:41] <Sadale> Wouldn't help. He learned it by exposure.
[19:32:49] <Sadale> It's like asking me if Cantonese/Chinese's easy.
[19:33:20] <Sadale> Not sure if I should go straight for PH or learn Spanish and have a few more options.
[19:34:11] <Sadale> For PH I'd have Miyu ezekiel Terminu and possibly davik tho. I've got a lot of friends there :3
[19:34:34] <Sadale> For south america I barely know anyone there thanks to timezone :<
[19:35:24] <TsundereNoises> Sadale: I think we have a few users, but I can't think who lives in Brazil
[19:35:33] <Sadale> TsundereNoises, That's spoonm 
[19:35:44] <TsundereNoises> yeah so that's not spanish
[19:35:45] <Sadale> The problem is Brazil don't speak Spanish :(
[19:36:01] <Sadale> It has the most population tho. In South America
[19:36:14] <Sadale> I guess that's like the China of South America
[19:37:28] <TsundereNoises> anyway, at least the latin roots in English might help with Spanish some, it'll be easier than starting English with only knowing Cantonese or something
[19:45:20] <TsundereNoises> oh, Sadale, I don't know if you know about it, but if you have pronunciation problems, forvo.com is a really helpful site
