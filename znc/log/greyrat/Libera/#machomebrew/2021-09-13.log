[19:07:54] <mns> I have emacs cask installed and want to install an older version than what I have right now.  how do I go about doing that ? 
[19:17:15] <tdsmith> homebrew probably doesn't help you
[19:25:47] <mns> I thought there was a method to downgrade a package, no ?

[22:02:11] <davidfetter_work> hi
[22:02:26] <hexology> is this channel migrated from freenode? what's its status with respect to the homebrew project? official, unofficial?
[22:02:51] <davidfetter_work> I put in a request on the GH site
[22:03:02] <tdsmith> "yes" and "unofficial"
[22:03:08] <hexology> i just made ##homebrew-pkg but i didn't know about this one :)
[22:03:33] <hexology> i'll just chat here
[22:03:35] <davidfetter_work> on a slightly different topic, I feel like I'm missing something really important, but howtf am I supposed to get xscreensaver to actually be my screensaver?
[22:04:37] <tdsmith> good question
[22:04:39] <hexology> you installed it with homebrew on linux?
[22:05:53] <hexology> i think it depends on your WM/DE, right? it's been a few months since i did any linux stuff like that
[22:05:59] <davidfetter_work> no, xscreensaver is alleged to work on MacOS
[22:06:11] <davidfetter_work> as in there's a .dmg & everything
[22:07:23] <davidfetter_work> afaict, an X client (Jesus, X people. Did you *really* have to get that one backwards?) isn't required.

[22:09:05] <davidfetter_work> it's a cask, too, so I would assume that if it did require that, it would have been pulled in when I installed the cask

[22:14:19] <hexology> huh
[22:14:23] <hexology> i think you might need xquartz running for that
[22:14:36] <hexology> which basically runs "on top" of your mac interface
[22:14:51] <hexology> afaict xquartz on mac is basically big transparent fullscreen window
[22:17:22] <hexology> i doubt you can replace the system screensaver with xscreensaver on mac
[22:17:39] <davidfetter_work> There's nothing to suggest that in the formula for the cask or such docs as jwz has chosen to include on the web site.
[22:18:29] <davidfetter_work> he's far and away the most pleasant person I know who won the dotcom lottery, but he tends to assume people are a lot brighter than they are.
[22:20:43] <hexology> can you provide a link to said docs?

[22:27:33] <davidfetter_work> There's really not much there that I've found so far, except for "Muck Ficrosoft," which is very easy to get on board with. https://www.jwz.org/xscreensaver/
[22:34:32] <hexology> davidfetter_work: i suspect that this person is running xquartz all the time on their mac
[22:34:50] <hexology> is there an `xscreensaver` in `Applications` now?
[22:38:08] <davidfetter_work> nope. The cask installs a list of programs ending in .saver in ~/Screen Savers/
[22:38:15] <hexology> ah
[22:38:24] <hexology> do you see them in the mac screen saver settings?
[22:38:29] <hexology> maybe you need to log out and log back in

[22:49:55] <davidfetter_work> OK, will try that. I don't recall ever logging out of a Mac before. Is there a way to do that and keep all things running?
[22:59:30] <hexology> no, i think you have to close all your programs to log out

[23:09:59] <tdsmith> you can enable fast user switching iirc

[23:22:19] <hexology> my intention is to make really damn sure that the screensaver list is updated
[23:22:26] <hexology> you probably _dont_ need to log out for that
[23:22:54] <tdsmith> fast user switching is probably insufficient in any case :p
