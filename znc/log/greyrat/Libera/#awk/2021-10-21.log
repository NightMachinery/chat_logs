[18:58:18] <thad_the_man_2> Howcan I print all the fields after the NTh field?
[18:59:40] <yitz> With a for-loop
[19:21:59] <nmz> it depends
[19:22:12] <nmz> thad_the_man_2: is the FS important?
[19:23:09] <nmz> if there is no chance of a collision you can use index and substr, this keeps FS, so its a good method
[19:23:39] <nmz> you can also erase all the fields until you reach the field you want, then sub() and print
[19:24:23] <nmz> if you have a stable OFS, then you can use a for loop
[19:48:44] <thad_the_man_2> Ok. Thanks.

[22:26:48] <izabera> i wrote a thing
[22:26:50] <izabera> it's dumb
[22:26:57] <izabera> can someone review my dumb dumb
[22:30:59] <Patsie> I'd love to
[22:31:02] <izabera> no it's dumb
[22:31:34] <Patsie> what a tease...
[22:32:11] <nmz> mmm
[22:32:25] <nmz> does it have comments
[22:32:29] <nmz> or is it like xmb's shit
[22:32:36] <Patsie> hehe
[22:32:58] <izabera> i uhhhhh
[22:33:04] <nmz> I swear xmb pissed me off whenever he posted what could be described as gibberish
[22:33:05] <Patsie> unreadable, whitespace-less gibberish :P
[22:33:13] <izabera> this has whitespace!
[22:33:25] <nmz> ok ok, readability points +1
[22:33:35] <nmz> no comments then?
[22:33:44] <Patsie> code is comments enough :P
[22:33:46] <izabera> who needs comments when the code is self documenting!
[22:33:50] <Patsie> exactly
[22:33:52] <izabera> anyway i need more time because i just had an idea, will post in a few hours, stay tuned
[22:34:15] <Patsie> I might have gone to bed by then :(
[22:34:41] <nmz> well... awk code is... very very terse
[22:34:49] <nmz> I'd agree if it was not awk
[22:34:58] <nmz> even though you were sarcastic
[22:36:12] <Patsie>   # add score to highscore
[22:36:12] <Patsie>   score::add(highscore, score)
[22:36:12] <Patsie>   printf("%s\n", yahtzee::str["top10scores"])
[22:36:12] <Patsie>   score::top10(highscore)
[22:36:12] <Patsie>   score::save(highscore)
[22:36:22] <Patsie> that's perfectly readable, isn't it?
[22:36:34] <Patsie> I could have removed the comment even
[22:36:38] <nmz> ya
[22:36:44] <nmz> that's gawk
[22:36:50] <Patsie> true
[22:36:50] <nmz> and namespaces!
[22:37:00] <Patsie> yeah, experimenting a bit with namespaces
[22:39:17] <Patsie> izabera: but yeah. still curious. so give us a hint
[22:41:23] <izabera> i tried to implement filter/map/reduce and it works better than i was expecting when i started writing it
[22:41:41] <Patsie> nice
[22:41:48] <Patsie> nothing dumb about that
[22:56:31] <izabera> https://termbin.com/7r62
[22:57:59] <izabera> it's a bit dumb
[23:06:23] <Patsie> nice, I like it
[23:09:06] <Patsie> personally I might replace the 'else' statements in all functions with 'if (array in SYMTAB)' (like you do with the 'if (isarray(array))\'
[23:10:37] <Patsie> and out of curiosity: why not have 'result' as a parameter of your map/filter/reduce functions? why make it global instead?
[23:11:46] <Patsie> (arrays are passed by reference, so you can modify them)
[23:20:58] <Patsie> I like the nesting of functions

[23:50:00] <izabera> if it's a parameter it becomes local
[23:50:20] <izabera> or did i not understand what you mean
[23:59:39] <Patsie> # awk 'function f(myarray) { myarray[2]="TWO" } BEGIN { split("one two three four", a); f(a); print a[1], a[2], a[3] }'
