[13:43:55] <gioele> varjag: the speed difference is minimal, what is interesting is the difference in peak-mem: 2 MB vs 42 MB
[13:46:19] <varjag> common lisp brings its own runtime
[13:47:26] <varjag> also, the generational gc allocates several pools probably
[13:48:53] <varjag> in some implementations you can reduce the memory footprint by tree-shaking the library but am not sure sbcl does that
[13:51:20] <varjag> i see that a (tree-shaked) lispworks application on our arm32 board uses 18mb resident… still a far cry fromc/rust minimal applications of course

[18:54:39] <gwozniak> I ran into a truly damn annoying build problem for our libraries where starting from scratch in the build still didn't fix the problem.  Still haven't totally figured it out, but it had to do with GCC not finding stddef.h in its internal library headers

[21:01:00] <technomancy> well, not *all* the time
[21:01:42] <banna> Fancy features are great, but if it isn't protecting the programmer from doing dumb stuff it's just... dense?
[21:02:28] <banna> i.e. when people shoehorn functional language paradigms into procedural langs
[21:02:49] <technomancy> you're not talking about portability any more then?
[21:07:09] <ngoldbaum> banna: or they can be like python doing that and then arbitrarily deciding to move reduce but not map or filter to a different namespace in a major version bump
[21:07:46] <technomancy> lol
[21:08:06] <banna> ngoldbaum: yes.
[21:09:05] <banna> technomancy: I guess you're right - I'm not 100% talking about portability at that point. More like languages trying to import features from langs with entirely different paradigms?
[21:09:28] <imode> banna: minimalism is a virtue in many cases when it does not compromise maintainability, understandability and performance. I do it all the time.

[21:17:00] <imode> technomancy: half the point of java being that a bytecode virtual machine with abstractions higher than ones you expect from your processor means portability, safety and security.
[21:17:28] <c355e3b> in practice, just do everything off heap because the gc gets bent out of shape over too many things
[21:17:36] <imode> like yeah the JVM sucks in a lot of respects but you can't deny that in a lot of ways it just works. happy to be proven wrong about that, though.
[21:18:10] <technomancy> imode: seems like most of the folks mentioned doing OOP copycat work actually did learn that lesson?
[21:18:27] <technomancy> like racket, ocaml, CL; they all have bytecode engines
[21:18:50] <c355e3b> I mean we are doing XX billion events per month using it

[21:19:11] <imode> technomancy: yeah but they didn't learn it initially.
[21:19:15] <c355e3b> #realtalk Self and erlang probably came away with the "best" OO ouut there

[21:20:13] <imode> technomancy: errybody wanna be Java -> errybody adopts OOP and bytecode VMs, thinking the former is the real winner -> errybody realized that they went too far but kept the bytecode VM.
[21:22:06] <technomancy> ah I see what you mean. it's like "maybe the real treasure was the friends we had all along" type situation.
[21:22:21] <imode> pretty much, yeah.

[21:23:16] <wink> banna: bad historical example, but PHP 3 didn't have OO. Many, many people continued writing PHP without OOP long afrer PHP 3 was gone

[21:25:15] <technomancy> it's more about "OOP is not about objects/classes" being historical revisionism
[21:25:22] <technomancy> which I guess is very erlang-adjacent
[21:25:24] <wink> banna: yes and no. let's say for "a smaller codebase" some sort of "I use functions and files as modules are fine" but I fully support that at some point, PHP was more professional and the community had agreed on some sort of best practices. and OOP was def part of it  for projects that were as big as the dreaded Java enterprise mammoths of that time

[21:28:25] <c355e3b> and I'm on hour two of homebrew just updating
[21:28:43] <indigo> c355e3b: Sounds fun dude :) custom db engine and everything? Or built on top of something?
[21:28:47] <kronk> software is like gas, hot air. it expands to fit the available space and time.
[21:28:51] <c355e3b> yep

[21:28:56] <c355e3b> all custom
[21:30:49] <cb> imma be honest, brew is kinda gross
[21:30:51] * cb uses macports
[21:31:03] <indigo> I didn't know MacPorts was still alive
[21:31:34] <technomancy> I read they got homebrew working on linux or something? I can't understand that at all
[21:31:52] <technomancy> it's like if you ported cygwin to debian; who wants that?
[21:32:01] <cb> it's pkgsrc for webshits
[21:32:04] <indigo> Maybe it's for folks that are switching from macOS to WSL
[21:32:12] <cb> probably yes
[21:32:25] <technomancy> the whole point of homebrew is "I can't use apt-get on my system" afaict
[21:32:29] <c355e3b> man cygwin on debian would be hilarious
[21:32:34] <c355e3b> fink was a thing
[21:33:07] <wink> indigo: I think macports had either a hiatus or a years-long period of everyone going ugh. and only at some points some homebrew fans switched back
[21:33:11] <cb> homebrew can work around when your package manager is dogshit/you don't have system admin perms/the packages are better maintained
[21:33:25] <indigo> Cygwin was nice for its time
[21:33:35] <wink> indigo: that is simply conveying what I absorbed from coworkers, I never had a mac
[21:33:48] <ngoldbaum> wink: homebrew maintainers got burnt out and started doing a lot of breaking changes, making it less useful overall
[21:33:54] <mTvare[m]> or as brew tells it

[21:34:45] <wink> yeah, guess it's a timeline thing.
[21:34:53] <indigo> So many ways to instal software
[21:34:57] <wink> I see macports mentioned more often int he last n years
[21:35:20] <cb> for me i have a server if i need to get hard in the unix paint
[21:35:28] <cb> so macports is a mere nice to have

[22:29:57] <simmel> speaking of the whole homebrew now sucks, maybe macports again?-theme. And please, I'm not trying to start a war here: but using nix is possible on macOS, but can I install program A at version X.Y.Z with nix? Or do I always have to install the latest and greatest?
[22:30:15] <technomancy> simmel: pretty sure you can do that with nix
[22:30:19] <simmel> I haven't been able to find that out without testing it.

[22:30:48] <simmel> technomancy: You don't sound that sure tbh = )
[22:31:02] <ngoldbaum> simmel: you definitely can
[22:31:29] <dmc> til homebrew now sucks?
[22:31:36] <ngoldbaum> you may not be able to get a version with a very specific set of dependency versions without compiling it yourself
[22:32:16] <ngoldbaum> dmc: homebrew used to be very flexible although with lots of buggy corners, they decided it was too much work to fix all the corner cases so they made homebrew *a lot* less flexible and configurable
[22:32:18] <simmel> One of the things with homebrew that boils my blood is that when they upgrade to the latest minor of Python, say from 3.8 to 3.9, they break everyfuckingthing that uses Python and I have to manually reinstall everything and send a patch to mopidy so that they uses the latest Python and
[22:32:23] <simmel> then reinstall that and deal with C depdendencies...
[22:32:25] <technomancy> simmel: I haven't used it in ~a decade but I can't imagine they would offer their system without that feature
[22:32:36] <ngoldbaum> simmel: use pyenv
[22:32:52] <ngoldbaum> homebrew is *not* the tool to do anything using python the way they manage updates

[22:33:54] <ngoldbaum> this is also wrapped up with it being incredibly toxic to work on a project as popular as homebrew on github unless you’re very thick skinned
[22:34:13] <ngoldbaum> which leads to this awful maintainers-vs-the-world mentality
[22:34:23] <ngoldbaum> and a lot of perceived hostility on all sides
[22:34:37] <simmel> ngoldbaum: For my own dev, no no. I'm sticking with asdf (which uses pyenv sorta) for my own dev. But mopidy needs a Python and I sure don't want to keep it updated. I have to maintain my own sort of homebrew for that.
[22:35:13] <simmel> homebrew just got too big and had too many users (that also needed help and submitted issues). And also to few maintainers.
[22:35:22] <ngoldbaum> yeah i guess they’re just offloading maintainance for python *apps* onto upstream
[22:35:31] <ngoldbaum> doesn’t help that cpython breaks shit more often now
[22:35:44] <ngoldbaum> it was nice having a decade of mostly stability with python2.7
