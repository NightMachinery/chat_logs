[14:28:41] <clarkk> The following command returns "ERROR: requested format not available". What am I doing wrong?   youtube-dl -f "[ext=mp4][height=720]+[ext=m4a]" https://youtu.be/QrKqIKG52jE
[14:29:17] <clarkk> Note that listing the available formats using -F shows that 720p mp4 video and m4a audio are available
[14:49:58] <ede> clarkk: ext=m4a
[14:50:29] <ede> 140 isn't grabbed even standalone
[14:51:10] <clarkk> ede, What you've written looks the same
[14:52:37] <ede> works with mp4 for video, with 140 for audio. but not with m4a.
[14:53:57] <ede> > if you want to download the best  mp4  and  webm  formats  with  a  height  lower  than  480  you  can  use -f '(mp4,webm)[height<480]'.
[14:54:59] <clarkk> ede, it's actually selected the wrong video. Let me try again
[14:56:01] <clarkk> I want to download 136, without specifying the id, and be able to use the same command for other videos
[14:57:31] <ede> i'm still wondering what the correct syntax would be
[14:57:57] <clarkk> This also doesn't work
[14:58:00] <clarkk> youtube-dl -f "[ext=mp4][height=720][container=mp4_dash]+140" https://youtu.be/QrKqIKG52jE
[14:58:16] <ede> there's a ton of possibilities to use with format selections, also [] AND () and the manpage mostly has some examples without really explaining the syntax
[14:59:56] <nimaje> why do you just use […] and not use worstvideo[…] or some other sorting? I guess the problem is that [ext=mp4][height=720] isn't unique for that video
[15:00:59] <clarkk> nimaje, see the second version of my command, where I specify the container
[15:01:44] <ede> "mp4[height=720]+m4a" works
[15:01:44] <clarkk> I don't use worstvideo because I want to be able to use it for more than this video, and sometimes the available formats are too bad
[15:02:15] <clarkk> ede, ok, but I'd still like to understand what's wrong with mine
[15:02:40] <ede>               $ youtube-dl -f 'bestvideo[ext=mp4]+bestaudio[ext=m4a]/best[ext=mp4]/best'
[15:02:45] <nimaje> > or some other sorting    worstvideo was just an example
[15:02:55] <ede> that's the only occurence of this syntax in the manpage
[15:03:42] <ede> maybe [k=v] is just for further selections
[15:04:02] <ede> as you'd use "with" in natural language

[15:04:48] <clarkk> ede, yes, that would make sense. Thanks
[15:04:54] <ede> 2nd example also works with plain "mp4"
[15:05:10] <clarkk> ede, not for me - it chooses 22
[15:05:29] <ede> because file extension it maybe would make sense to use .mp4 anyway
[15:05:29] <clarkk> If I use -F, the table has one column called "note".  What is that for video?
[15:05:55] <clarkk> vbr?
[15:06:19] <ede> 22? i have a f136.mp4.part right now
[15:07:12] <ede> i think that's for everything which doesn't fit into the other columns
[15:07:24] <clarkk> ok, I think this command works for my purposes...   youtube-dl -f "mp4[height=720][vbr<400]+m4a" https://youtu.be/QrKqIKG52jE
