[10:26:32] <solrize> i'm trying to convert an epub file to latex and i get a latex file that throws undefined sequence errors because it seems to be missing some imports.  is that a known thing?
[10:27:22] <solrize> if i try to get pdf output it wants me to convert with tetex (ok) and then complains about a bunch of non-ascii chars missing from the lmroman10 font
[10:27:48] <solrize> the latex output file never uses documentclass which i get the impression it is supposed to do
[10:45:48] <solrize> ok i got further with newer pandoc
[10:53:33] <solrize> but, still no documentclass in the latex output

[15:48:23] <jaawerth> solrize: huh. fwiw I'm seeing hte same thing but I no know more than you
[15:50:09] <jaawerth> solrize: actually, no sorry, it is generating different content for me depending on documentclass. poor reading comprehension on my part at first
[15:50:55] <jaawerth> as a test case you oculd do what I did and grab something simple like markdown, and convert it to latex with `-V documentlcass=article` and `-V documentclass=book` and diffe them - there should be different tags in play
[16:00:09] <solrize> jaawerth, i inserted a document class into a pandoc init file and that helped.  i can get it through telatex now and get a pdf, but there are some unicode chars in it (it's a novel that contains some sentences in Thai) and they come out as mojibake
[16:00:16] <solrize> i figure i'll mess with it more tomorrow
[16:00:56] <solrize> i added ucharclasses and that didn't help
[16:02:01] <solrize> i think the pandoc latex backend needs a little improvement (maybe not that big a deal) and the tex unicode situation needs probably a lot of work, to get a usable font set together that covers as big a chunk of unicode as browsers and terminals do these days
[16:53:34] <jaawerth> I assume you've already tried the `fontfamily` and `fontfamilyoptions` variables?
[16:54:04] <jaawerth> I think font handling is more or less just handed over to the relevant pdf/latex engine
[16:55:17] <jaawerth> manpage talks a lot about fonts in relation to the tex backend in use
