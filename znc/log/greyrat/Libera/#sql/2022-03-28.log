[12:36:15] <Xgc> stark2: Report the bug if unix_timestamp isn't returning the expected result.  Keep in mind, if it returned the expected result it might not be appropriate for randomness.  It's tough to guess your real requirement from that description.
[12:38:49] <stark2> i want different random id every time i run a query, which is possible by using rand(). but i need a replacement of if, i tried UNIX_TIMESTAMP() and it is giving the same random value every time i run the query
[12:38:51] *** Joins: glowdemon2 (~glowdemon@193.190.154.176)
[12:41:01] <stark2> for eg, rand() is giving output 1- 45,23,67,56,78 output 2 - 11,57,34,98,27 and so on but UNIX_TIMESTAMP()  output 1 - 55,87,66,34,12 output 2 - 55,87,66,34,12, output 3 - 55,87,66,34,12
[12:44:39] <glowdemon2> Hi. I have an app that tracks time spent on projects and shows some statistics. With every request, I pull about 1000+ rows of timing data and then I calculate my statistics in Java. I believe this is very inefficient and have already thought about replacing this by creating views that calculate these statistics. Is this the best way to go, or are
[12:44:39] <glowdemon2> there any products/services that would be a better fit for my usecase?
[12:59:16] <Xgc> stark2: unix_timestamp is not and should not be random.  But it should provide a different value each second.
[13:00:16] <Xgc> stark2: You're either misusing it or you found a bug.  Which database are you using?
[13:02:02] <Xgc> glowdemon2: Hard to tell without detail. "some statistics" doesn't provide enough detail to compare your approaches, even if you provided clear information on your approach.

[15:43:45] <Xgc> Atque: Those are not standard SQL.  You need a FROM clause with each SELECT expression to be standard.
