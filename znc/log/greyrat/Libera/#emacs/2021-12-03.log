[00:59:05] <horribleprogram> basically, what's the default loading of these .emacs.d/* files, if u add a homemake directory like ~/.emacs.d/foo/ do u specify a command in ur init.el to add that directory as part of a PATH that emacs will check for .el files?

[01:01:13] <howard-abrams> (And I load those files based on some conditions a well.
[01:01:17] <horribleprogram> howard-abrams: correct
[01:01:17] <thblt> Something like (add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name foo user-emacs-directory))

[01:12:34] <bpalmer> if you evaluate (require 'foo) , it will first check if the feature 'foo has already been provided. If so, it does nothing. Otherwise, it will guess that 'foo will be provided by a file like "foo.el" (or "foo.elc"), and search in every directory in load-path in turn.
[01:12:36] <horribleprogram> oh it's specified in 49.4
[01:12:46] <horribleprogram> bpalmer: kk i see
[01:13:26] <bpalmer> when it finds one, it will then load that file, and then check if it provided the feature: (provide 'foo). If not, it will raise an error and complain.

[04:38:25] <junebug> thanks skangas 
[04:38:45] <bpalmer> in particular, emacs 19 -- which was significant in many ways -- was from the early 1990s
[04:39:01] <junebug> I think Richard Stallman created emacs right?
[04:39:12] <bpalmer> mmh. That's subject to a bit of debate.
[04:39:33] <bpalmer> He is widely credited with it, and particularly for gnu emacs.
[04:39:38] <junebug> Oh I just looked it up in wikipedia. I'm wrong
[04:39:48] <junebug> He ported it over to Gnu

[07:50:13] <corwin> afaik a plist is just a list so your function returns a list or a list. iow, without "knowning stuff" about your plist what you ask isn't possible: thus, there probably isn't a better way.

[08:41:15] <twb> codingquark: it's noweb which is tex/c
[08:41:25] <codingquark> Okay
[08:41:31] <twb> original literate programming was tex/pascal or something bonkers ilke that

[18:32:35] <susam> nicode: ESC ESC ESC and C-g have some differences. In some rare situations ESC ESC ESC can do things that C-g cannot. As an example, say, you typed M-x or C-s or something else that brought up the minibuffer at the bottom of the window. But then you got distracted by something in the buffer and went back to the buffer. Now while you edit the buffer and launch other commands, that minibuffer you left dangling

[18:33:34] <susam> nicode: In such a case, pressing ESC ESC ESC will instantly get rid of the dangling minibuffer. If you were to get rid of it with C-g, first you would have to go to the minibuffer (say C-x o or mouse click) and then press C-g while you are on the minibuffer. ESC ESC ESC can be convenient in such cases.

[19:43:36] <pingpongball> I mean i'm using doom-outrun-electric, so i need to go to that .el file and change manually, where is that file located, any way i can go through emacs
[19:43:51] <tricon> pingpongball: I copied the file from doom-emacs and modified it. I would recommend creating a new theme instead of editing the source in a package.

[21:07:31] <krux02> I like emacs for it being a programmers environment, rather than a text editor. It is made by programmers for programmers. people who know how to solve things with code and logic.
[21:07:51] <krux02> I wish there were more alternatives to emacs in terms of such environments.

[21:10:35] <acdw> mmm that's fair too
[21:10:41] <krux02> but I also think that the default emacs editor is nothing to brag about.
[21:10:57] <acdw> i honslty like the default theme with a few changes

[21:14:33] <krux02> I think there is huge value in disguising emacs as a bland and boring text editor that just works like everything else on modern operatiosng systems without weird unconventional keybord mapping, like C-x C-s for saving instead of C-s, and C-s for search instead of C-f
[21:14:42] *** Joins: kensanata (~user@user/kensanata)
[21:15:22] <kensanata> How do you run "git grep foo" in Emacs? M-x grep appends /dev/null to the command line and git complains about it.
[21:15:49] <bpalmer> kensanata: see grep-use-null-device
[21:15:50] <grym> kensanata: i use counsel-git-grep
[21:15:54] <krux02> from that point on you can sneak emacs into the workflow of many unaware users who will adapt emacs in their dayly workflow unknowingly
[21:16:29] <krux02> and then some of them will become good and they will just continue to use emacs and keep the system alive.
[21:16:41] <bpalmer> kensanata: so one straightforward approach would be to write git-grep let-binds grep-use-null-device to nil after prompting for it all
[21:16:48] <bpalmer> but, honestly, I'd probably just M-! it
[21:16:57] <kensanata> but... grep mode?
[21:17:17] <kensanata> I wonder why grep-compute-defaults decided that t was the correct value.
[21:17:20] <bpalmer> I don't get a lot of benefit from it, but you could just manually put it in grep mode after the fact, I think
[21:17:38] <kensanata> Yeah.
[21:17:41] <krux02> but I am not sure if prefexis like C-x or C-c can ever be disabled and just be used as cut and copy

[21:23:37] <xheimlich> is anyone using a keyboard layout besides qwerty/intl qwerty variants.
[21:23:56] <greenline> I use dvorak
[21:24:04] <greenline> Actually one of the reasons I came to emacs
[21:24:10] <xheimlich> my laptop comes with a ç key where I like ; to be. but other than that.
[21:24:22] <greenline> because emacs has semantic key-bindings rather than positional keybindings
[21:24:26] <greenline> (vi mixes the two)
[21:24:30] <acdw> i wanna dvorak
[21:24:34] <acdw> should i just start using it
[21:24:34] <bpalmer> hrehf: I see, so you want to change the regexp to look for 'filename(lineno): error' ? 
[21:24:43] <xheimlich> I'm not sure how well dvorak would work with extended alphabets.
[21:24:55] <hrehf> bpalmer: hmm... probably? I'd like to find out which regex matches in the first place :()
[21:25:00] <greenline> here's how I started using it: I just went cold turkey while in college. I had to learn it because I had to type and turn it papers. I don't recommend it
[21:25:06] <greenline> but an effective method, I think ;-)
[21:25:15] <greenline> once you start, you have to commit IMO
[21:25:27] <bpalmer> hrehf: ok, so look at those two variables I mentioned
[21:25:50] <xheimlich> like my language has çáéíóúêô 
[21:26:12] <greenline> are those produced with dead keys?
[21:26:14] <acdw> greenline that's how my dad learned to drive stick shift
[21:26:17] <contrapunctus> acdw: Dvorak rocks...way better than QWERTY
[21:26:56] <greenline> I don't know if my typing is faster with dvorak per se, because I never learned to properly touch type with qwerty. having the keycaps be incorrect also helps force you to learn to touch type
[21:26:56] <acdw> yeah? i guess i could just start using it. maybe if i get a little bit of time off
[21:27:03] <bpalmer> neither rock nearly as bodaciously as Wyld Stallyns
[21:27:04] <acdw> mm that makes sense greenline
[21:27:10] <acdw> lmao bpalmer, that s true
[21:27:19] <acdw> i have a mech keyboard, i think i oculd move all the keycaps
[21:27:29] <contrapunctus> acdw: I switched last year, initially thought I'd maintain both QWERTY and Dvorak, but even when I was familiar with QWERTY and less so with Dvorak, each time I switched to QWERTY I was like "eh, screw this". Dvorak is just that much more comfortable.

[23:27:13] <aidalgol> Oh yeah, I forgot you're a FreeBSD weirdo.
[23:27:26] <aidalgol> How good is GPU support on that platform?
[23:27:28] <Catie> And the world is a better place for it
[23:27:43] <aidalgol> Also, I just realised that rudybot is a perfect example of this: https://www.smbc-comics.com/comic/ai-8
[23:27:57] <Catie> Depends on the GPU really, but I haven't had a huge amount of luck

[23:29:19] <rudybot> bremner: but I'm finding it hard to work out what you are saying because of your use of pronouns
[23:29:26] <bpalmer> Mr. Mxyzptlk is a 5th dimensional trickster god, whereas the Penguin is a rich club owner.
[23:29:56] <bpalmer> I think we know who wins.

[23:30:24] <aidalgol> bpalmer: Is that DC's answer to Marvel's norse gods?
[23:30:56] <aidalgol> Anyway, it was a trick question.  The correct answer is, "It depends on the penguin and the imp."
[23:32:15] <bpalmer> in some ways, DC's New Gods (which are opponents of Darkseid) are similar to Marvel's asgardir
[23:32:44] <bpalmer> although maybe the New Gods compare to the Eternals, hmm. 
[23:32:52] <bpalmer> or , rather, the Celestials.

[23:34:32] <bpalmer> oh, I forgot the more relevant mapping. DC is filled with greek gods -- e.g., Wonder Woman fights Ares in her first movie. Marvel also has greek gods (e.g., Hercules shows up a bunch) but MCU hasn't brought them in so far.
[23:35:33] <aidalgol> Didn't she fight Aphrodite in one story?
