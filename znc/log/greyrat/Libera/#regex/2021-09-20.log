[08:16:44] <pluri> how do i match either to the end of the string, OR until a given character?
[08:17:13] <pluri> let's say the character is a. if i add (?=a) at the end of the pattern it will fail in case there is no a
[08:17:56] <Me-me> [^a\n]*
[08:18:16] <Me-me> Meaning "match zero or more characters that aren't a or a newline character".
[08:22:19] <pluri> that doesn't work in my situation unfortunately. here's an example: https://regex101.com/r/em5hvI/1
[08:22:45] <pluri> I need to capture the C in the middle, both when it's followed by a, and when not. it's always preceded by z
[08:24:54] <pluri> my instinct tells me to use (?=a|...) , but there doesn't seem to be a token to go in ... meaning "nothing"
[08:25:12] <pluri> I could use \n actually
[08:25:36] <Me-me> Perhaps if you provided more complete example data.
[08:26:26] <purplex> you can add ? at the end or, (?=a|) .. mot sure of your question
[08:26:39] <purplex> not completely sure*
[08:28:22] <pluri> here is a complete example: https://regex101.com/r/qEl9NX/1
[08:28:36] <pluri> the problem is it needs to work also without /?text 
[08:28:51] <Me-me> https://regex101.com/r/qEl9NX/2
[08:29:20] <pluri> I am trying to catch collection-name
[08:29:25] <pluri> in a group
[08:29:31] <Me-me> https://regex101.com/r/qEl9NX/3
[08:30:18] <pluri> thx that works 
[08:30:29] <pluri> interesting approach
[08:30:40] <pluri> heh
[08:30:43] <pluri> clever
[08:31:10] <purplex> yep i suggest always ask with real example, regexes don't magically work on both vague and real example :p
[08:31:30] <pluri> haha i'm used from asking coding questions to always provide an abstraction 
[08:31:42] <pluri> in that situation it's usually an advantage, even necessary 
[08:32:13] <pluri> but regex is finicky 
[08:33:12] <pluri> anyway interesting that sometimes it's better to tell regex what you don't want, rather than what you want
[08:39:13] <Me-me> Regex is very literal.
[08:39:35] <Me-me> So we ask for as complete of an example as possible - abstractions are better for pure logic, whereas the pure logic regex works with is the literal characters involved.
[08:40:15] <Me-me> Not to say that simplifying isn't sometimes the best way to communicate, but it's better to work backwards to that than forward from that in this context, I think.
[08:40:50] <pluri> yeah i agree
[08:43:56] <purplex> one way is if you want to hide your data, just replace abc, but don't change the "structure" and "format" of text to match
[08:45:30] <purplex> so if you're trying to match html, but you show us a string, that won't work :p
[08:46:33] <pluri> yeah, i guess a lot of regex is very specific to the data you're working with. and there isn't much use to identify a more "general" pattern
[08:46:38] <pluri> the supreme pattern lol

[12:27:21] <re101-adelie-72> we want to differentiate between the line without "secondary" keyword and with "secondary" keyword
[12:27:22] <digitok> wait are you saying you only want one match
[12:27:57] <digitok> ok do you want all 4 values in 1 match? or 2 matches

[12:30:30] <re101-adelie-72> i can have 4 different regex to capture these 4 values
[12:30:35] <digitok> ah
[12:30:40] <re101-adelie-72> i want to store them in separate variables

[12:32:16] <re101-adelie-72> IP and PW-ID (e.g. 10.228.158.110 3680450) will always be in this order
[12:32:34] <digitok> here you get 1 match with 4 groups

[22:43:41] <fandre1986> Hello guys, in this expression I want to match all the context around 'port 1/1/9:101' from exit to exit 
[22:43:45] <fandre1986> https://regex101.com/r/4yE8nY/1
[22:45:21] <fandre1986> Any ideas? :)
[22:50:06] *** Joins: nvmd (~nvmd@user/nvmd)
[22:51:21] <yitz> exit(.*foo.*)exit and take capture group 1
[22:51:31] <yitz> Or use non-capturing on the "exit"
[22:57:03] <purplex> if you don't need any values this can work https://regex101.com/r/4yE8nY/2
[23:07:52] *** Quits: daoudr (~daoudr@178.197.212.191) (Remote host closed the connection)
[23:10:39] <purplex> my original idea https://regex101.com/r/4yE8nY/3
[23:11:55] <fandre1986> I got your idea purplex but the only issue is that not always I will have 'interface' 
[23:12:14] <fandre1986> I'm trying to do with non-capturing on the 'exit' 
[23:12:41] <purplex> you can change it to work with 'exist' as well
[23:14:47] <purplex> by adding (?<=exit\n) instead of "interface ".
[23:16:52] <fandre1986> https://regex101.com/r/4ZCisg/1
[23:17:32] <fandre1986> I want the last 'exit' 
[23:19:13] <purplex> at the end add, \s*exit
[23:20:49] <fandre1986> okey !
[23:21:07] <fandre1986> and sometimes I can have {2} or more before 'port 1/1/9:101' 
[23:21:58] <purplex> yes note that this regex assumes 'port' is on second line from 'interface' but the 'original' idea regex assumes there's no 'exit' before 'port' comes
[23:22:37] <yitz> This would be much easier to just parse without trying to do as a single regex
[23:22:48] <yitz> awk would be really good for this
[23:22:54] <purplex> but i guess you might be more fine with just grabbing it using two exits now since you mentioned it
[23:25:22] <fandre1986> I took it from your original idea 
[23:25:23] <fandre1986> https://regex101.com/r/vRJXWJ/1
[23:25:34] <fandre1986> is a bit of monster but works:)
[23:28:11] <purplex> if we simply use exit.*port.*exit then it doesn't have any idea which 'exit' you want, so thats why i had to write it that way
[23:28:56] <fandre1986> yeah, is good 
[23:29:32] <fandre1986> I was struggling with the False captures 
[23:29:37] <fandre1986> Thanks guys!
