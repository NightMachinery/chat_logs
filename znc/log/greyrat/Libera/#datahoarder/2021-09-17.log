[03:35:38] <skye0_mobile> part of me feels like i have to join a union if i couldn't work for the NHS, in order to get out my true grievances with companies (i.e. copyright law). anti-union BS in the UK isn't as bad as in the US, but still a far cry from like Europe and/or anywhere else that unions are treated relatively well
[03:36:40] <joepie91> unions here are fairly useless though

[03:36:44] <unfinity> joepie91 you befriended a duck in 3.363 seconds! You have made friends with 199 ducks in #datahoarder.
[03:37:05] <joepie91> their 'business' is mostly collective industry-wide worker agreements and that's more or less it
[03:37:32] <joepie91> there's not a whole lot of class consciousness or intersectionality or grassroots motivation or really any of the other things you'd want to see in a broader activist movement
[03:37:54] <joepie91> they did show up to the housing protest at least
[03:38:12] <joepie91> but as a participant, not as an organizer
[03:38:26] <skye0_mobile> i have either to pretty much boycott most organizations out there to the point that if i lose my job in the NHS i can't find an organization i'd want to work in, or just start risking my freedom by making money through illegal means
[03:38:30] <joepie91> it's all very... respectable
[03:38:35] <skye0_mobile> like, idk, processing seedboxes or whatever

[03:38:58] <unfinity> About the TUC | TUC
[03:39:17] <joepie91> skye0_mobile: I think you're looking at it too absolutely
[03:39:29] <joepie91> you need to live, you need to eat
[03:39:43] <joepie91> you can have serious ethical issues with capitalism and still work for a company to earn a living
[03:40:16] <joepie91> it is of course preferable to participate in that particular grind as little as possible, but it's not a personal failing if "as little as possible" turns out to still be quite a bit
[03:40:49] <joepie91> and activist involvement can exist separately from that
[03:41:03] <skye0_mobile> i came across an article somewhere about how businesses at least in the US since the 70s effectively started lobbying for all kinds of bullshit. i don't want to be in that number, especially if i worked for a multinational.
[03:41:15] <skye0_mobile> i also can't imagine being able to do much outside of work too
[03:41:44] <joepie91> have you looked for local direct-action-y groups?
[03:42:02] <skye0_mobile> one of the issues i care most about is copyright. i wish the UK cared more about trying to break it
[03:42:04] <joepie91> think food not bombs, giveaway shops, that sort of thing

[03:42:32] <joepie91> skye0_mobile: yeah but copyright is not an isolated issue
[03:42:36] <skye0_mobile> sometimes i feel out of touch with my community, sometimes i do but idk. i don't feel like i deserve to be involved with others because of the grave mistakes i made
[03:42:52] <joepie91> mistakes like? if you feel comfortable saying
[03:43:39] <skye0_mobile> i'm not comfortable saying them, but saying some fucked up stuff about myself and with regards to certain events that took place
[03:44:13] <skye0_mobile> i'm also just isolated in general so if these direct action groups aren't available online or outside facebook it's gonna be hard for me to connect with them
[03:44:25] *** Joins: mjs2600 (~mjs2600@c-24-91-3-49.hsd1.vt.comcast.net)
[03:44:33] <skye0_mobile> if i'm gonna work i'd at least like to be able to spite the fucking copyright system and stuff
[03:44:44] <Selavi> saying stuff about yourself? that caused harm to others?
[03:44:48] <joepie91> everybody makes mistakes, though, you shouldn't let yourself by defined by your mistakes but rather by how you've decided to learn from them
[03:45:09] <joepie91> skye0_mobile: as for connecting with them, the nice thing about stuff like food not bombs and giveaway shops is that you can just... show up, and offer to help
[03:45:22] <skye0_mobile> Selavi saying stuff about myself that i'd rather not discuss in public, having my voice on YT, saying other shit that was offensive and/or got to people
[03:45:23] <joepie91> whether they know you or not
[03:45:54] <joepie91> they're inherently collectivist things so they're usually quite open
[03:45:55] <skye0_mobile> but i don't feel like 40 hours of work a week will leave me with enough time to fuck the system unless i wanted to throw away my freedom from a terrible mistake i'm likely to commit as a result of no time planning
[03:46:13] <Selavi> remember, judgements say more about the judge than the judged
[03:47:15] <joepie91> skye0_mobile: two hours a week is enough to get in touch with people :)
[03:48:49] <skye0_mobile> i struggle to make the most of my spare time so i don't use it terribly efficiently - i want to enjoy myself but i'm finding it hard now to figure out what i like doing for a living. as for direct action groups, yeah, this is gonna be difficult for me to figure out when i feel pretty damn isolated as i don't know who to turn to
[03:49:28] <joepie91> literally just google around for stuff like food not bombs and show up unannounced :p
[03:49:38] <Selavi> just do what you can, when you can. you don't have to save the world. you don't even have to be ready yet to do the smallest thing. give yourself time
[03:50:11] <joepie91> direct action groups are not generally the kind of organizations that work with receptionists or interviews
[03:50:24] <Selavi> but yeah, figuring out what exactly you want in life is a big one. isolation is a tough one as well
[03:50:27] <joepie91> just showing up and offering to help will often be greatly appreciated
[03:50:36] <joepie91> even if you know absolutely nobody there, have never been there before
[03:51:57] <skye0_mobile> joepie91 i wonder if they would be able to signpost me to other direct action groups
[03:52:11] <joepie91> almost certainly
[03:52:25] <skye0_mobile> i will need a source of income in order to move out and pay for this data hoarding project
[03:52:27] <joepie91> if you get involved with something you'll probably start getting invited to other places
[03:52:34] <joepie91> meetings, parties, etc.
[03:52:39] <skye0_mobile> Selavi I'd like to change copyright law and put a wrench in the system
[03:53:05] <Selavi> law school it is! :p
[03:53:14] <skye0_mobile> i would hope my time in these groups aren't in vain if i feel like i'm forced to move away from the NHS for my main source of income
[03:53:47] <skye0_mobile> Selavi I'm pessimistic but i don't want them to win. part of me wants to get involved in like the black market or something of copyrighted content
[03:54:09] <sarnold> that's one way to move out of the parent's house..
[03:54:24] <sarnold> or is that parents' house?
[03:54:31] <skye0_mobile> parents'
[03:55:11] <skye0_mobile> i'm sticking with the NHS for the time being but if i'm having no luck with the NHS for work i'm just really picky with what i want to do for a living. i am considering like working for an organization that deliberately aids piracy if i had to
[03:58:05] <skye0_mobile> also i'm not sure if a vegan organization would be able to help me with the things i stand for joepie91, i do fear that they'll be spiteful for me wanting to get signposted immediately upon getting to know them
[04:00:45] <Selavi> if you're not empathic to their way of life or don't compensate them for helping you, perhaps
[04:01:48] <skye0_mobile> yeah i couldn't care less about what people eat and am not vegan myself. town i live in is big on trying to push people onto veganism
[04:02:03] <skye0_mobile> i just love meat too much
[04:02:07] <Selavi> and some people are Helpersâ„¢ and won't mind. can't really know until it's tried
[04:02:27] <skye0_mobile> and i doubt vegans care about stuff like copyright law, and may even praise companies for being 100% vegan or something
[04:02:39] <Frogging101> Check out the FSF, maybe?
[04:03:03] <Selavi> I mean the organization may not care, but people are multifaceted
[04:03:10] <skye0_mobile> I'm just thinking of Peter Gelderloos' writings and that monkey selfie copyright dispute - head of PeTA wanted the monkey to have the copyright on the photo, I don't think copyright in its current state should exist at all
[04:03:48] <Frogging101> I don't think trying to join an organization just because they are contrarian on some random issue is a good move. That's just a gateway to general extremism and nonsense
[04:04:06] <skye0_mobile> Frogging101 I'm in the UK. they operate internationally I guess, but the fact I use a lot of GPL incompatible software might be a source of friction. I've been involved periodically with #defectivebydesign, an anti-DRM group, just annoyed by their limited effectiveness
[04:04:22] <Selavi> pretty much agreed. generally policy is changed by both sides understanding each other and making requests
[04:04:35] <joepie91> skye0_mobile: well like I said, copyright is not an isolated issue. I think it's probably good to focus on social issues in general and not *just* copyright, and you'll start seeing links to other issues appear
[04:04:56] <joepie91> just get a foot in the door and go from there, see where it takes you
[04:04:59] <joepie91> trying is free
[04:05:46] <skye0_mobile> joepie91 that is correct i guess but especially if you're like in america, the system refuses to confirm the link between racism and capitalism
[04:06:03] <joepie91> skye0_mobile: sure, but direct action groups are not 'the system' :p
[04:06:15] <Selavi> the system is very complex. parts of it do, others don't
[04:06:32] * joepie91 should go to bed
[04:06:37] <sarnold> gn8 joepie91 :)
[04:06:39] <skye0_mobile> yeah. i'm not sure if i have faith in my town when some anti-vax group demonstrated here and the only other active organization here is the rather white XR
[04:07:06] <Frogging101> Oh. I see. You're looking for a group of lunatics.
[04:07:14] <Frogging101> that's nice
[04:07:29] <joepie91> skye0_mobile: there's probably more, just not that high profile
[04:07:44] <joepie91> Frogging101: wat
[04:07:54] <skye0_mobile> Frogging101 been recommended Food not Bombs. I want something like the FSF but probably more drastic, or anything that would be adjacent to my goals of subverting the whole copyright system
[04:08:43] <joepie91> sarnold: feels like "should" is gonna be doing a lot of work in that comment...
[04:08:51] <sarnold> joepie91: lol :D
[04:08:52] <Frogging101> I see words like "the link between racism and capitalism" get trotted out and I smell crazy.
[04:09:06] <joepie91> that sounds like a you problem, Frogging101 
[04:09:18] <Frogging101> yeah, no, I'm out.
[04:09:20] * Frogging101 &
[04:09:30] <Selavi> I mean, sure, skye has quite the convictions
[04:09:40] <skye0_mobile> Frogging101 i care too little about race personally to the point i've been kicked out from some server where i made an incorrect assumption about someone based on their race
[04:09:45] <skye0_mobile> discord server
[04:11:03] <skye0_mobile> at this point i'd have no one but gender policing pricks to turn to. i was once part of a discord server and found someone who both didn't have a significantly sensitive attitude towards race and was sympathetic to the alt-right
[04:11:16] <skye0_mobile> shouldn't have watched all those sargon of akkad videos but i was bored and clueless online
[04:12:40] <skye0_mobile> but yeah i hope that some direct action group(s) will help me with punching capitalism in the face and any other issues i have.
[04:15:12] <Selavi> I find making friends far more meaningful and effective than making enemies
[04:15:54] <skye0_mobile> i make enemies too easily, i find it far more difficult to make friends. fairly recently someone blocked me on twitch and banned me on discord and they never told me why. i could have said something offensive and/or something that got to them
[04:16:22] <skye0_mobile> well, i could have asked them why but out of respect i decided to part from their community and that of their friends too
[04:16:35] <Selavi> I highly, highly recommend the book Nonviolent Communication
[04:16:45] <skye0_mobile> i just tend to rant a lot
[04:17:15] <skye0_mobile> that streamer who blocked me is not open to any dialogue with me
[04:18:36] <Selavi> and if you'll permit me to plug a podcast by my dear brother's dear friend: "
