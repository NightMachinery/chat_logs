[16:37:32] <taavi> thelounge0598: please just ask your question, someone will answer if they can
[16:37:46] <thelounge0598> can you change the language to german or adapt the design and logo?
[16:37:52] <thelounge0598> taavi - thx
[16:38:56] <mnx> Is there a way to force the lounge to connect using only ipv4? 
[16:41:04] <fnutt> thelounge0598: You cannot change the language easly, sadly. You'd have to manually change the wording in the code and compile.
[16:41:48] <fnutt> However you can change the design and logo fairly easy. Logo is just an image you can find in the folder where you installed The Lounge.
[16:41:57] <fnutt> Just switch image.

[18:12:50] <bookworm> or receiving garbage apparently, that gives the same error
[18:13:25] <bookworm> meaning if you try to connect with TLS on a port that talks plaintext to you you'd get the same error
[18:14:53] <bookworm> Jay2k1: start is easy, spawn TL in the fg. With stop, what do you kill? Which of the three processes that got spun up by various shells / utilities? (worst case, but it's possible)
[18:15:55] <bookworm> generally the assumption is that if you start it in the fg, well just c-c it. If you shoved it in the bg, great, use job control within your shell
[18:16:34] <bookworm> generally if you started it with a supervisor of some sort (systemd, init, docker) you need to use the corresponding commands there
[18:16:57] <bookworm> else systemd will happily respawn TL for you as it (from its view) crashed

[18:34:46] <Jay2k1> yeah sure.... i guess we could write a pid file but that adds unnecessary complication
[18:35:01] <Jay2k1> just kinda weird to see a start command without a stop command
[18:36:07] <bookworm> how come? Do you see a stop command on say vim? or neomutt? Or htop?
[18:36:38] <bookworm> the reason we have start as a verb is that the cli is overloaded, you are simply telling TL what you want to do. 
[18:37:46] <bookworm> we could've a different UX by using thelounge --useradd and then leave thelounge as being thelounge start. But it acts more like git with subcommands
[18:37:54] <bookworm> say similar to ip

I have the regular /msg idlerpg message in the network settings, but it sends the message before joining the idleRPG channel and therefore fails.

[20:12:06] <control-z> I already use SASL for authing with NickServ, but it doesnt work for IdleRPG
[20:12:13] <control-z> its a seperate log in
[20:12:35] <bookworm> I know
[20:13:02] <bookworm> but all the idlerpg bot cares about is that you are the proper account afaik
[20:13:27] <bookworm> ah, you need to be on the channel too, I see
[20:13:34] <control-z> yeah thats the issue
[20:14:27] <bookworm> you can try with the explicit join, not sure 8f that would work but you can try
[20:15:24] <control-z> that actually works, nice
[20:17:18] <bookworm> hah, looking at my *perform module I actually solve it the same way on my own setup :D

[22:05:00] <control-z> What are the extra features provided by that setup?
[22:06:14] <timsan> Using znc? Stability if you do not have a very stable internet connection. 
[22:06:37] <dav1d> I used TL as a znc frontend for a while, useful when you also want to use a non-web client
[22:06:47] <dav1d> + management features from znc

[22:07:02] <timsan> like that guy could use znc (example)
[22:07:44] <control-z> timsan: I'm already hosting TL on a VPS, hosting ZNC wouldnt make the connection any more stable I think
[22:08:32] <dav1d> it's definitely not useful for everyone
[22:09:01] <control-z> Alright
[22:11:15] <timsan> I use znc on a VPS, it works fine for me
[22:11:44] <timsan> and with znc, you can connect with other irc clients at the same time -- that's a nice feature. I use irssi as well

[22:35:20] <xnaas> There's also a newcomer to the bouncer space, soju https://sr.ht/~emersion/soju/
[22:35:44] <xnaas> I also have no need for a bouncer or client besides TL, so you're not alone, timsan.
[22:38:02] <timsan> thanks for the link, soju looks quite good.
