[03:41:53] <src> Timvde: it still happens from time to time I land on a http site that has https available but it isn't by default
[03:42:37] <src> not sure how every browser deals with enforcing https, firefox let's you turn it off
[03:43:16] <Friithian> I have plugins that try to auto redirect to https
[03:43:24] <src> the EFF one I assume
[03:43:29] <src> https everywhere
[03:43:33] <Friithian> hell, my website has enforced https, you literally cannot connect to it without https
[03:43:44] <Friithian> that is enforced at a TLD level
[03:43:56] <src> why would you not allow people to connect via http
[03:44:36] <Friithian> because it is $CurrentYear and there is no reason anything shouldn't have a cert
[03:44:42] <src> granted the "I'm on an old cli based browser that doesn't support https" is a bit of an edge case
[03:44:48] <src> but it's up to them no?
[03:45:11] <Friithian> nope, either they securely connect or they suffer
[03:45:27] <src> I don't agree, but it's your site, so it's your thing
[03:45:33] <Friithian> granted, connecting may be suffering in and of itself
[03:45:43] <src> I would want my site to be as connectable as possible, it's they don't use https so be it
[03:46:04] <src> *if they
[03:46:23] <Friithian> I see zero reason to not use https
[03:46:59] <src> so what? I see zero reason to use a firefox version which is 4 years old, I won't make a conscious effort to support it, but if I actually have to do something to make it not work, why would I?
[03:47:10] <Friithian> I didn't have to do anything
[03:47:27] <Friithian> I just picked a TLD, it has the feature of enforced HTTPS, and said "sure"

[03:58:20] <Friithian> what is XML inside XML?
[03:59:28] <AhmedAmerican> well, am calling an API which supposed to return an XML response. it's already did that but there's a tag which contain XML as text, where i need to pickup and then load it within XML parser
[04:00:00] <Friithian> should you not use the XML parser to pull the XML out (to then parse)?

[05:10:33] <Me-me> Try this.
[05:11:38] <MaxLeiter> beautiful
[05:11:43] <MaxLeiter> passed all my unit tests, thanks Me-me
[05:11:49] <Me-me> Take two https://regex101.com/r/LMCtJ3/3 Basically - match non-` characters, like your original, but also match ` that isn't followed by two more

[05:17:29] <MaxLeiter> ah Me-me, the second fails on ```yaml This is proper text in a `codeblock````, as it fails to match the fourth ` at the end

[05:18:01] <Me-me> I see.
[05:18:26] <Me-me> Is there always text inside the ``s? Or can they be empty?
[05:18:42] <MaxLeiter> uh, I guess it should support empty, but that would be very rare and I'd be fine if it doesn't
[05:18:47] <Me-me> https://regex101.com/r/yfLBYm/2
[05:18:55] <Me-me> I made it support empty. Just trying to make it validate :P

[05:57:42] <digitok> Timvde, Friithian, not sure about other browsers, but in chrome clicking the address bar once only selects/enables editing of the url without the protocol. you have to click again for that to be included

[06:01:00] <Friithian> I don't think that

[10:47:49] <digitok> yea, i think since they made the protocol not visible

[10:50:00] <digitok> they've definitely changed that

[10:55:12] <digitok> also there's probably a hidden setting you can change, not sure
[10:55:30] <digitok> re101-goat-19, symbols checking?
[10:55:56] <digitok> you want to check that a string contains 18 digits with optional symbols between?

[10:56:25] <re101-goat-19> i want to allow 18 or more digits or symbols
[10:56:27] <Timvde> digitok: there's not
[10:56:50] <digitok> so 18 symbols is valid with no digits?
[10:56:53] <Timvde> digitok: even worse, I don't know if they still do it, but at some point, Chrome also hid m. as a prefix
[10:57:05] <digitok> lol
[10:57:07] <Timvde> And m. is *definitely* not the same as www.
[10:57:11] <re101-goat-19> yes 18 symbols can be valid as well
[10:57:24] <digitok> what's a symbol? anything other than a-z0-9?
[10:57:39] <Timvde> I also think that m. is an antipattern, but oh well
[10:57:39] <re101-goat-19> for example 12345678901234567[
[10:58:19] <Timvde> re101-goat-19: is there a list of allowed symbols, or do you accept literally anything?
[10:58:35] <digitok> seems like you just want  ^[\W\d_]{18,}$
[10:58:48] <digitok> or  ^[^a-zA-Z]{18,}$  (same thing)
[10:58:48] <re101-goat-19> can allow any values
[10:59:02] <re101-goat-19> ok digitok, will try
[10:59:20] <Timvde> Sounds like you want ^.{18,}$ tbh :P
[10:59:35] <digitok> he said digits and symbols
[11:00:07] <Timvde> "Any values"
[11:00:46] <re101-goat-19> both can be used
[11:00:53] <re101-goat-19> thank you so much
[11:01:49] <Timvde> re101-goat-19: so use digitok's regex if normal letters aren't allowed, or mine if they are
[11:02:39] <Timvde> But in the latter case, you can probably just use `len(mystr) >= 18` or something like that in your programming language
[11:02:54] <re101-goat-19> alright thanks
[11:03:02] <digitok> are letters allowed?
[11:03:07] <digitok> re101-goat-19

[18:10:38] <Me-me> https://regex101.com/r/IxsUh4/3
[18:10:56] <Me-me> It's not that much shorter. But it has less capture grouping, which is more efficient.
[18:10:59] <Me-me> Technically :P
[18:11:29] <re101-mayfly-15> ^^
[18:11:40] <re101-mayfly-15> thats good to know

[18:12:16] <Me-me> Heh. Except your version takes less steps.
[18:12:29] <re101-mayfly-15> well... um
[18:12:39] <Me-me> So apart from adding ?: in every group to save on memory, your pattern's fine.

[18:17:36] <re101-mayfly-15> It's ok, I'm very new to regex so "But it has less capture grouping, which is more efficient." is good feedback at this point
[18:18:03] <Me-me> Yeah, capture groups being the default is a bit of a trap.
[18:18:26] <re101-mayfly-15> also noticed that adding ?: increased steps
[18:18:32] <Me-me> It shouldn't.
[18:18:36] <re101-mayfly-15> hm
[18:19:07] <Me-me> https://regex101.com/r/IxsUh4/4 This is your pattern but with everything as non-capture
[18:19:14] <Me-me> 356 steps, same as the original.
[18:19:53] <re101-mayfly-15> oh, wrote :? not ?: -- woops!
[18:20:42] <Me-me> Right :P anyway, your pattern takes into account the behaviour of character classes and of alternatives. It uses the quantifier in the right place. It's good stuff - especially since your consideration has outperformed the automatically generated value.
[18:20:52] <Me-me> *automatically generated pattern

[18:21:35] <digitok> of course
[18:22:16] <Me-me> mayfly: The next step is to learn about \d and \w - \d can replace [0-9] here. Makes the pattern shorter, but not slower.
[18:24:38] <re101-mayfly-15> I did notice it and ever searched a bit about it

[18:24:56] <re101-mayfly-15> according to this (12 year old post)
[18:24:57] <re101-mayfly-15> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/890686/should-i-use-d-or-0-9-to-match-digits-in-a-perl-regex
[18:24:58] <Me-me> I prefer the .info site myself.
[18:25:13] <digitok> v4 has a superfluous group
[18:25:31] <Me-me> The outer group is unnecessary, yes.
[18:25:44] <digitok> 46 steps for that one
[18:25:46] <digitok> yw
[18:25:53] <Me-me> mayfly: Yyyyeah that's not the general consensus these days.
[18:25:59] <re101-mayfly-15> ah I see
[18:29:57] <digitok> actually, that seems like it's still valid in perl
[18:30:30] <digitok> even without using /u, if the input string is unicode, \d will match unicode numbers
[18:30:33] <digitok> !eval "\x{660}"
[18:30:34] <perlbot> Ù 
[18:30:38] <digitok> !eval "\x{660}" =~ /^\d$/
[18:30:40] <perlbot> 1
[18:31:03] <Me-me> I think that's the point. They want it to exclude unicode numbers, in that stackoverflow question.
[18:32:08] <re101-mayfly-15> they only wanted to include "numbers" that the code could perform mathematics on I think
[18:32:26] <digitok> so what were you saying is not the general consensus?
[18:33:08] <re101-mayfly-15> so I think it depends on use case
[18:33:55] <Me-me> digitok: The stackoverflow question was "should I use \d or [0-9]" and I say that the general consensus is \d.
[18:34:00] <Me-me> Do you disagree?

[18:34:42] <digitok> in the context of perl, which is the context of the stackoverflow question, yes
[18:34:49] <digitok> because the reasons listed are still valid
[18:34:50] <Me-me> P'shaw.
[18:34:59] <digitok> do you disagree?
[18:35:12] <Me-me> Kinda.

[21:40:48] <digitok> there's a simplified version
[21:41:09] <re101-bombay-73> Eee the (?i) works for upper and lower case?
[21:41:14] <digitok> yep
[21:41:30] <digitok> f+ means 1 or more "f"
[21:41:39] <digitok> u* means 0 or more "u"
[21:42:05] <digitok> so you can just change the letters and add [\W_]* between them
[21:43:09] <digitok> (?i)\b(f+[\W_]*u*[\W_]*c*[\W_]*k+|...|...)\b
[21:43:23] <digitok> here you could add more words where the ... are

[23:30:28] <r00tb0y> 11[10Guest5311] \d* means 0-x digits
[23:30:49] <r00tb0y> 11[10Guest5311] \d\d* means 1-x digits
[23:31:23] <Guest53> why would no digits be selected using \d* if there are 0-x digits present within a string?
[23:31:26] <r00tb0y> 11[10Guest5311] \d\d* is the same as \d+
