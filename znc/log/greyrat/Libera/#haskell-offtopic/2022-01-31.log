[14:21:45] <dminuoso> It's kind of curious how that person ragefully left the channel, just to be evidently either monitoring via a secondary user or polling the IRC log to wait for a response, perhaps to prove to themselves that we'd introduce hateful language after they left?
[14:22:01] <geekosaur> I noticed that, yes
[14:22:21] <geekosaur> the descriptive "high-strung" comes to mind
[14:23:18] <dminuoso> It's a bit annoying, I've seen them repeatedly become very emotional about various subjects. 
[14:23:53] <geekosaur> yeh. not specific to #haskell either, they hang out in ##soccer too and are pretty much the same way
[14:23:58] <dminuoso> And this constant act of simulated self-pity is really annoying.
[14:24:11] <dminuoso> Ah, alright
[14:24:23] <kuribas> he has some personal frustrations.
[14:25:21] <kuribas> probably
[14:25:49] <dminuoso> Best to simply ignore this.
[14:26:00] <arjun> ignore what : D
[14:26:34] <dminuoso> Them.
[14:26:52] <arjun> who : D
[14:27:02] <dminuoso> This dramatic exit in #haskell, which seems like it just serves to provoke any kind of response, proving to them that we're a toxic community.
[14:27:41] <dminuoso> But I suspect the lack of response might be interpreted as "lack of compassion" as well. So yeah, I simply wont dignify that with a response in that channel
[14:27:48] <dminuoso> It's obvious they are polling the IRC logs to see what we subsequently say
[14:27:54] <kuribas> maybe we are :)  It's true haskellers dislike most other languages.
[14:28:23] <dminuoso> I think this applies to all language communities.
[14:28:41] <dminuoso> Every language has fanboys that, for one reason or another, imagine they are subjectively right in considering their language superior to others
[14:28:51] <geekosaur> I stand by my original statement to them: it seemed to me like they made lots of assumptions about how things "ought" to work and didn't want to hear about how they have to work
[14:28:53] <dminuoso> Sorry. *objectively
[14:29:19] <geekosaur> granting this hvm looks interesting but I doubt it gives them all the things they were convinced they could get if they just tried hard enough
[14:29:39] <arjun> i don't think i get what this is about anyway : D
[14:29:40] <dminuoso> We just have this bad habit of having *academics* sharing these opinions, which not only strengthens our position in our minds (after all, unlike other languages we have the academics on our side), but it can also give a "snob" and "impossible to learn" attitude
[14:29:45] <arjun> it's almost tea time here
[14:29:54] <arjun> what's up with you fine folk
[14:30:15] <dminuoso> geekosaur: Somehow I doubt this is about HVM at all.
[14:30:40] <dminuoso> If I go back in the discussions involving them, then there's a variety of topics where they feel like they're being misunderstood
[14:30:50] <dminuoso> This is a personality issue
[14:31:36] <geekosaur> they've been tossing around a language of their own devising, it has distinct similarities to the one that comes with hvm
[14:32:01] <dminuoso> If anything, I find that the Haskell community is mostly more open to alternative languages.
[14:32:15] <dminuoso> Heck, people regularly hijack #haskell for idris support or questions. :P
[14:32:25] <geekosaur> so I've seen
[14:32:53] <geekosaur> and even the occasional python question althouugh I think we've mostly trained people to come here instead :)

[16:05:13] <hpc> i made a setup with jenkins for $job where every branch, git tag, and merge request gets built automatically and organized appropriately
[16:05:34] <hpc> and the hardest part of the whole thing was just interacting with our chosen rpm builder
[16:05:57] <hpc> the actual jenkins logic was idiot simple :D
[16:07:12] <hpc> it has interactivity in the middle of jobs too, which i want to make more use of too
[16:07:22] <hpc> to gradually automate things that have lots of https://xkcd.com/2565/ to them
[16:07:59] <hpc> you can leave a job running for months at a time, and even if you reboot jenkins it'll remember where it left off
[16:08:34] <hpc> and of course, you can kick off a build manually - a feature that all these yaml runners somehow STILL manage to not all have

[21:56:39] <dminuoso> In a previous job, we did radar reflection analysis by employing some ray tracing mechanisms. Based on various things, it was pretty impossible to make any prediction about the time for a given ray tracing.
[21:56:52] <dminuoso> And yet, the manager insisted the ray tracing give some kind of progress bar with an estimated time.
[21:57:26] <geekosaur> time remaining until the big crunch: ************
[21:57:44] <dminuoso> We simply used a negative exponential curve, with some factors based on previous tests.
