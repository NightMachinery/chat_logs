[04:11:08] <johncs> Using the Messages app on Mac OS X, I realize that instead of "react" to react to a message, they call it "tapback". Is that just Apple tryna coin terms for no reason, or is there some kind of IP law tied around the usage of the word "react" when referring to reacting to messages.

[16:26:02] <winter> fnutt: heads up, i can still repro the issue i described a week or so ago with iOS 15.4b2 -- were you ever able to repro it on either of them?
[16:31:20] <val> What is the meaning of "if (Uploader)" here? https://github.com/thelounge/thelounge/blob/master/src/server.js#L752
[16:32:45] <val> (I'm a JS noob, I don't see what could make a module object falsy)
[16:33:46] <fnutt> winter: I'm sorry to say I forgot what the issue was/is. Can you please rephrase?
[16:35:06] <fnutt> If I remember correctly it has to do with the newest iOS version... hmm..
[16:35:14] <fnutt> Let me update my iPhone right now.
[16:37:20] <fnutt> I'll get back to you as soon as my iPhone is updated. It says 9 minutes, but I'm pretty sure it takes a lot more than that.
[16:58:34] <bookworm> val: chances are that's a programming error / nonsense... blame it? Might be some leftover pf when it was conditional. Quickly I arrive at the same conclusion as you do
[17:02:55] <val> ü§∑ https://github.com/thelounge/thelounge/commit/ce212e001#diff-79f4c7cdc0b026f6e556196f5911a449157807cffdb3f9d33f0b5404b4ffc2f3R620-R623
[17:05:26] <bookworm> yeah I was looking at it as well
[17:06:17] <bookworm> to be honest new Uploader(socket) seems a fairly unusual pattern as well (it immediately discards the new object and just uses the constructor for the side effects)
[17:06:52] <bookworm> which looks to me like it should have a Uploader register_socket method instead but hey that's me
[17:07:11] <bookworm> I mean it's effectively treated a s a singleton

[19:34:24] <xnaas> Only 1 out of 3 PWAs I use loads as a PWA. The Lounge is fine as a regular Safari tab. The other application exhibits what you're talking about, having to reload the page several times to get anything other than blank white.
[19:34:57] <xnaas> PlexPy (known now as Tautulli) is the only one that loads fine.
[19:35:37] <xnaas> The other webpage is https://github.com/cheeaun/hackerweb but hosted on my own webserver.
[19:35:57] <xnaas> It's the one that's extra fucked üòÖ
[19:36:56] <xnaas> But since it's a dev beta, I'm not really shocked or upset; it's just a bit of an inconvenience to load TL in a Safari tab, but I assume it'll work itself out in time ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø (meaning: Apple stops breaking shit :P )

[22:07:28] <Cienisty> I've also been going to report a problem with PWA on ios. Apple will slowly introduce push notifications for PWA applications, maybe they will introduce it in September, so it would be nice to prepare for it.
[22:08:37] <Cienisty> firstly, the new apple phones have curved corners, and the PWA application is all the way down, so it sort of cuts the text and makes it difficult to click the textarea for a message
[22:09:40] <Cienisty> secondly, there is a graphic error when typing a message
