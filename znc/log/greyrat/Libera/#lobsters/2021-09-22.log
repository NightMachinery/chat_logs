[06:57:10] <usrme> thus their titles had to be renamed as well to reflect that, but they couldn't for political reasons titulate them as Junior Software Engineers, so they all got the title of Senior Software Engineers despite never in their life writing a piece of code that wasn't a PowerShell script to iterate over files in a directory or something

[07:17:35] <pnoud> Apartment complexes need a lot of maintenance.
[07:17:43] <imode> if the monthly payments on a property don't exceed the cost of renting the equivalent building, buying is the better option.
[07:17:45] <usrme> they might, but I'm mostly isolated from that
[07:17:51] <imode> it's an asset, you can sell it.
[07:18:02] <bkero> Unless your apartment complex has a finnicky tar roof, grounds, elevators, and all the other things that come with trying to manage a lot of infra in a smaller space
[07:18:07] <pnoud> Right but the big apartment complex I lived in just continually decayed over the 7 years I was there.  And rent only went up.

[07:30:59] <bkero> You can sell your primary residence and go back to renting or living in an RV or anything else.
[07:31:23] <bkero> So I don't see how that flexibility isn't there, if not a bit more inconvenient.
[07:31:33] <bkero> The liquidity is lower but that doesn't mean it isn't an asset
[07:31:43] <pnoud> Yeah, but to get ahead on that you have to time the sale properly.
[07:32:06] <bkero> Not that much, especially if you're not trying to buy something else
[07:33:54] <pnoud> I guess I just don't think of it that way.  I have no interest in buying a house until I have the financial security to just do it anyway.
[07:34:13] <pnoud> If I ever make money on a house it will be by accident.
[07:34:49] <pnoud> Well, at least as a primary residence.  I'm honestly more likely to buy a house in Idaho and pay someone to manage it as a rental.
[07:35:41] *** Joins: jmw (~jmw@user/jmw)
[07:37:56] <bkero> Buying something for $500k that you could have financed for less interest than you would be nearly guaranteed to make in other ways is a financially irresponsible move for all but the most conservative.
[07:38:20] <bkero> You can certainly do it because it makes you feel better though.
[07:39:20] <pnoud> I don't mean pay cash for the house.  I mean have my finances sorted out without _needing_ the house to make money.
[07:39:30] <bkero> I see
[07:39:54] <pnoud> I think that's the danger in viewing the house as an asset.  It can be used to justify being house-poor.
[07:40:28] <pnoud> You're right, it *is* an asset, but a house isn't the first thing I want to invest in.
[07:41:12] <pnoud> I can't believe the amount of money people are able to finance.
[07:41:44] <bkero> Yep, it's irresponsible but very lucrative to lenders.
[07:41:57] <bkero> even if they default, that's why they make you pay for insurance
[07:41:59] <pnoud> Like "I drive a used toyota but I have a $800,000.00 mortgage
[07:42:15] <bkero> I have a $400k mortgage and drive a 21 year old Miata
[07:42:30] <bkero> It has appreciated from $3500 to $9000 in the few years I've had it.
[07:42:51] <pnoud> I bought a 5 year old BMW 5 years ago.
[07:42:56] <pnoud> It has not appreciated in value.
[07:43:12] <bkero> There's nothing more expensive than an aging German sports sedan.
[07:43:31] <bkero> At least in the automotive world
[07:43:35] <pnoud> Yeah
[07:44:09] <bkero> I've thought about an E30 before
[07:44:19] <bkero> E46 would be as new as I would want out of a Bavarian car
[07:44:19] <pnoud> But even a rapidly deprecaiting german sedan is a drop in the bucket next to an 800k house.
[07:44:41] <bkero> I dunno, 800k houses have appreciated in the last few years unlike your house :)
[07:44:43] <bkero> In all but a few markets
[07:44:47] <pnoud> I bought a 2010 BMW 335 in 2015.  I could have had an E46 M3 for the same money, but the E90 had a warranty still.
[07:44:48] <bkero> err, unlike your car
[07:44:56] <pnoud> The M3 would have held its value.
[07:45:12] <pnoud> bkero: yeah but I didn't haev 800k in 2015.
[07:45:53] <pnoud> My point is that when I can afford a house I'll buy one.
[07:46:08] <pnoud> Which at this rate is probably in like two years
[07:47:22] <pnoud> I bought three pinball machines last year and they doubled in value, so maybe I should just keep doing that.
[07:48:33] <bkero> 20% down would be $160k. FHA or USAA loans can do 5% or even 2% down if you don't mind paying PMI.
[07:49:12] <bkero> Really the 'affording' part is being able to stomach the $4k/mo mortgage
[07:49:29] <pnoud> Right
[07:49:54] <pnoud> So it's a matter of having the down payment and enough cash in the bank for an emergency func that covers 4k mortgage payments.
[07:50:03] <pnoud> fund*
[07:50:07] <bkero> But you can always rent it out and live in a mother-in-law unit out back once your legal/contractual obligation for "primary residence" is established
[07:50:29] <bkero> Mortgage contracts I've read put that at 1 year
[07:50:30] <pnoud> I mean, sure, I could also move in with my parents.
[07:50:43] <pnoud> Not really something I'm planning on doing though.
[07:50:56] <bkero> I'm not sure if living in a unit in your own back yard but owning both is the same thing as moving in with your parents, but that's just me.
[07:51:01] <pnoud> Just isn't worth the risk until I can do it comfortably.
[07:51:36] <pnoud> What I mean is the next time 2008 happens I _probably_ won't be homeless.
[07:52:14] <pnoud> But I have a lot of friends who are in a big damn hurry to buy NOW and it just seems like a huge risk to me.
[07:52:33] <pnoud> But what the hell do I know, I didn't buy bitcoin either.
[07:53:12] <bkero> There is likely to be a lot of liquidity in real estate, at least in Canada.
[07:53:25] <bkero> So in the short term there's probably a cool several-years-worth-of-income to be gained in the next few months.
[07:56:24] <pnoud> Yeah.  I also need to adjust to the fact that I', not actually poor anymore
[07:57:06] <pnoud> Anything that isn't cash in the bank feels reckless, but the reality is the opposite.

[19:22:56] <epilys[m]> so the internet told me to charge an hourly rate bigger than a regular pay rate for freelancing but now I'm counting the hours and it's a lot?? do I just charge the company a big load of money? I feel like a fraud lol

[19:23:41] <shapr> you pay for your own hardware, software, office space, etc
[19:23:51] <c355e3b> The rule I've seen is that each employee costs twice their take home pay
[19:23:52] <shapr> epilys[m]: you really should charge a much larger hourly rate
[19:24:04] <shapr> you will pay for your own taxes!
[19:24:35] <dsc_> yeah.. your taxes and other costs are no joke
[19:24:48] <epilys[m]> yeah I figured out the taxes before I signed the contract but it still seems weird to me
[19:25:09] <shapr> epilys[m]: your clients are paying you to handle your own uncertainty

[19:28:36] <kline> epilys[m], the premium you charge is for the company not to have to do your legal admin etc
[19:28:55] <kline> for them, its easily worth a massive increase to have such flexibility in contractors
[19:29:04] <iDrougge> And for beeing free to fire you when they wish or need to.
[19:29:07] <iDrougge> being
[19:29:08] <shapr> right, that's the biggest thing
[19:29:21] <shapr> they pay you to handle your own uncertainty
[19:29:30] <shapr> there's no severance, or retirement, or healthcare, or etc
[19:30:11] <epilys[m]> all good points, thanks everyone 🙃

[19:31:58] <shapr> right
[19:32:22] <shapr> I contracted for the psychology department of the university of Erlangen for five years
[19:32:40] <shapr> They were thrilled with my work, but the uni slowly eroded their ability to hire contract coders
[19:33:12] <shapr> After about six years of making good enough money, all my contracting sources dried up and I had to leave Europe :-(

[23:50:18] <bkero> I'm sure that had this wrticle been written 10 years ago, Apple would cite it for the reason for not including any filesystem hierarchy in iOS
[23:50:23] <bkero> article*
[23:51:17] <cb> why should everything be a file hierarchy?
[23:51:32] <drobilla> You can fopen a directory on Linux at least, but I don't know if you can actually do anything useful with the FILE
[23:51:38] <cb> perhaps there are other ways of modelling the world
[23:51:50] <chenghiz_> > The primary issue is that the code researchers write, run at the command line, needs to be told exactly how to access the files it’s working with — it can’t search for those files on its own. Some programming languages have search functions, but they’re difficult to implement and not commonly used. It’s in the programming lessons where STEM professors, across fields, are encountering problems.
[23:51:58] <varjag> imo a system directory structure and its exposure as 'folders' to users in desktop metaphor are different use cases really
[23:52:04] <cb> indeed, there are others: tags, search, but other more concrete examples include the newton soups
[23:52:05] <varjag> the latter is a poor abstractions
[23:52:05] <technomancy> cb: well, what you definitely *shouldn't* do is create a file hierarchy and block users from seeing it

[23:53:08] <bkero> I have a folder called "myproject", inside that is a section for "pictures I'm including". That is sitting in a filing cabinet.
[23:53:17] <bkero> There's three levels of nesting
[23:53:18] <drobilla> Apple's whole thing about that only really makes sense when you're in a walled garden
[23:53:19] <varjag> do you really put folders inside a folder?
[23:53:33] <drobilla> ... and I'd say the fact that approximately everyone in the universe finds iTunes unbelievably confusing suggests that they botched it
[23:53:34] <bkero> envelopes inside of binders, sure
[23:53:39] <bkero> and binders inside of cabinets
[23:53:40] <kiedtl> Reminds me about what Spolsky said at one point. "Elite programmers like us understand the filesystem hierarchy and think it's a neat metaphor. Normal people just don't understand how you can have a folder inside a folder. They just don't." Not sure how true that is.
[23:53:42] <varjag> but folders
[23:53:42] <bkero> and cabinets inside of buildings
[23:53:49] <varjag> most people would argue cabinet is not a folder
[23:53:54] <varjag> and building is not a folder
[23:53:59] <varjag> ymmv
[23:54:09] <bkero> What is a folder?
[23:54:19] <bkero> and how is it different than a cabinet in this case?
[23:54:31] <kiedtl> !define folder
[23:54:43] <varjag> not every container is a folder
[23:54:56] <bkero> "filing cabinet"
[23:55:04] <varjag> my lunchbox is not a folder tho i don't doubt some people put envelope into lunch boxes too
[23:55:14] <technomancy> you can put boxes inside other boxes
[23:55:19] <varjag> yes
[23:55:27] <bkero> I'm not sure it's well beyond the average person to understand that you can put a thing inside another thing
[23:55:36] <technomancy> maybe Joel Spolsky only wrote that because at the time not everyone had ordered products on Amazon
[23:55:40] <kiedtl> Yeah, what I thought
[23:55:41] <varjag> but when you open a folder in windows you literally have icons of bloody folders
[23:55:43] <kiedtl> But then again
[23:55:45] <varjag> not filing cabinets
[23:55:48] <varjag> not envelopes
[23:55:52] <varjag> not lunchboxes etc
[23:55:57] <kiedtl> Spolsky has apparently done a ton of usability testing in the wild, so who knows.
[23:55:59] <bkero> So your problem is with the word 'folder'
[23:56:04] <kiedtl> yeah, maybe
[23:56:05] <bkero> Maybe replace it with directory?
[23:56:06] <gwozniak> pushcx: I'd change it to something like "Concept of files and folder eluding modern students"
[23:56:45] <varjag> bkero: my issue was with desktop metaphor, as in taking it too far
[23:57:15] <varjag> and it's not really a problem, more like that there is nothing natural about it
[23:57:48] <gwozniak> Also, it's not just STEM that is hitting this problem
[23:58:04] <gwozniak> Well, "problem", I suppose
[23:58:25] <drobilla> I feel like this is a bit silly in the context of STEM education?
[23:58:32] <bkero> People aren't used to these things? https://www.ldproducts.com/media/catalog/product/cache/3/image/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/1/0/1010040329.jpg
[23:58:35] <drobilla> Like, okay, Kids These Days aren't used to directory hierarchies
[23:58:44] <bkero> I'd have figured you still needed them when compiling school projects
[23:58:54] <drobilla> They presumably aren't used to, uh... programming either?  That is the point of education?
[23:59:24] <varjag> bkero: what's your point?
[23:59:34] <varjag> you have hierarchies of nested folders in school projects?
