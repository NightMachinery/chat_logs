[10:18:35] <A-KO> eh, debating on replacing my work keyboard. A while back I bought a Code keyboard with Cherry MX Clear switches, but deciding I'm not into them. So I'm considering replacing with a TKL version of the one I have at home--except the shit's out of stock atm
[10:18:38] <A-KO> because apparently it's popular
[10:19:58] <A-KO> I've got HyperX's Alloy Origins keyboard with their pudding double shot PBT keycaps--which are fucking awesome. Using their 'aqua' switches. They're a little bit lighter than cherry mx browns (very, very close though)
[10:20:21] <A-KO> and I can't seem to find anyone who makes a switch that's better atm.
[10:20:36] <A-KO> it's a very light tactile feel to it, not linear. The key bottoms out a bit so I might get some o-rings for the work one
[10:20:51] <A-KO> it's not a huge deal when I'm at home, but when I'm at work I can probably really annoy people since I type super fast :/
[10:20:53] <gibby> sup A-KO 
[10:20:56] <A-KO> waddup gibby
[10:20:57] <A-KO> nm
[10:21:12] <A-KO> wouldn't mind replacing the space bar spring a bit
[10:21:54] <A-KO> oh, Microcenter has a stock of them
[10:24:26] <csws> Temperature above threshold: 4294967168 C (> 55 C)
[10:25:35] <A-KO> this melts the computer
[10:26:14] <csws> mikrotik branching out into fusion
[10:26:25] <A-KO> yeah think I'll go to Microcenter tomorrow and pick up a TLK version of this keyboard for work
[10:26:38] <A-KO> I've got the full size at home, I'd prefer a TKL in generaly
[10:26:42] <A-KO> general* ugh I can't type, tired.
[10:27:02] <xe0n> i bought a wasd keyboard (this one) awhile back and never used it on this machine until covid lol
[10:27:08] <xe0n> i like it :)
[10:27:23] <xe0n> ummm browns i think
[10:27:50] <csws> yeah I have hte hyperx alloy in MX red at home
[10:28:04] <csws> I like the detachable cable, it fits really well

[10:30:09] <csws> yeah ducky is good
[10:30:36] <csws> I bought the hyperx keyboard because it was literally the cheapest thing I could find with cherry MX reds and honestly it's a really surprisingly good keyboard considering
[10:30:58] <A-KO> I've pretty much centered around brown switches and pbt keycaps.
[10:31:14] <A-KO> HyperX really did a damn good job with this setup, but I wouldn't mind maybe experimenting with some others. But their keycaps are just really good
[10:31:33] <A-KO> maybe a better spring for the space bar would be nice
[10:31:42] <A-KO> there's quite a bit of rattling on the spacebar press

[11:54:14] <A-KO> Might end up having to get some dampeners to help soften the keys though

[11:54:36] <xe0n> lol yeah ive got some in this keyboard
[11:54:47] <A-KO> I've got some in my work keyboard but not the home one

[11:54:58] <A-KO> I'll just get them all there
[11:55:14] <A-KO> there was a minor question of mine on whether I would go with 0.2 or 0.4mm dampeners, sounds like 0.2mm is better
