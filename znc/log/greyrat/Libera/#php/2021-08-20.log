[00:06:14] <Byteflux> If your resume is weak (lack of experience or very few skills) then sometimes it's worth toughing it out for a bit while you learn transferrable skills and move on to another job. Really depends at what stage of your career you are in.
[00:06:28] <__adrian> key word being "move on"
[00:06:42] <__adrian> this strategy doesn't work if you're wanting to stay with the same job long term

[00:08:03] <Byteflux> File that under a more general "culture" category.
[00:13:08] <relipse> I get that salary is not the only thing but is it worth taking a pay cut?
[00:13:35] <Byteflux> Nobody here can really tell you.
[00:18:57] <TinoDidriksen> Salary is not private in US (or anywhere, really). It's actually protected by law to publicly discuss salary, because that's cause for union building. Which is exactly why companies heavily discourage people from doing it - but they legally cannot prevent it.
[00:20:51] <relipse> so how do you look up someone's salary?
[00:21:10] <TinoDidriksen> You don't. I didn't say public - I said not private.
[00:21:13] <Byteflux> You can't. It's private information. You have the right to refuse to disclose your salary. The employer has the right not to hire you.
[00:21:49] <relipse> oh i get it , not private, not public, but "protected"!
[00:21:51] <relipse> php joke!
[00:22:13] <TinoDidriksen> Pretty much, which is silly. Fully public is so much better, but companies fear that.

[00:24:18] <celphi> If a company whitelists all the authorized programmers and suddenly that programmer's ip changes, is there an effective way to keep that person's access without having to manually add their new ip?
[00:25:10] <TinoDidriksen> Could tie in a auth+2FA service to add/update the IP.

[00:28:36] <__adrian> for what
[00:28:45] <__adrian> using a vpn? no
[00:29:00] <Byteflux> Presumably this is for developers to access an internal company network?
[00:29:07] <__adrian> not hard to find, but you should have someone that already knows what they're doing, do it
[00:29:51] <celphi> yeah i just wanted to research it myself before presenting the idea
[00:30:29] <Byteflux> VPN is one of those things almost every tech company uses, you can find abundant material on it online.
[00:30:40] <Byteflux> Another possible option is a zero trust based network
[00:30:44] <__adrian> idea is your developers would log onto the VPN, and all the restricted access things would be on that network
[00:32:42] <__adrian> re: IPs: ip ≠ 1 person, person ≠ 1 ip
[00:33:41] <Byteflux> OpenVPN can get a bit complicated for the uninitiated, but there are plenty of easier-to-use solutions like Pritunl (they also have a Zero Trust solution too)
[00:34:21] <celphi> so what about ExpressVPN
[00:34:43] <__adrian> most branded solutions are a gui that uses openvpn
[00:35:24] <Byteflux> ExpressVPN is a consumer VPN that connects you to *their* network.
[00:35:44] <Byteflux> You want a VPN that gives people access to the *company's* network.
[00:36:21] <celphi> k
[00:36:35] <celphi> So OpenVPN is what i need to research?
[00:37:07] <Byteflux> Like adrian said most commercial VPN technologies that businesses use are just fancy wrappers around OpenVPN
[00:37:23] <Byteflux> Understanding what OpenVPN is and how it works might be a good starting point

[01:05:35] <ordos> they're the least untrustworthy of the lot in my humble opinion
[01:06:57] <Sammitch> Byteflux: aws vpn is licensed per-user and might be reasonable for a single user, but good lord does it add up if you're trying to cover a department, or god forbid a company
[01:19:51] <Byteflux> Sammitch: I kinda figured it would scale the other way around
[01:20:09] <Byteflux> Becoming more cost prohibitive as you scale doesn't make a lot of sense >_>
[01:20:28] <Sammitch> yeah AWS _rarely_ scales their prices at all, it's almost always linear
[01:20:29] <__adrian> it gets cheaper per user but it doesn't get cheaper
[01:20:51] <Sammitch> does it?
[01:20:59] <__adrian> it *can
[01:21:08] <__adrian> i don't know about aws vpn specifically
[01:21:22] <__adrian> never looked
[01:21:39] <Byteflux> At the end of the day though it is a managed service which is going to place the cost above running your own thing in-house that doesn't come with support.
[01:22:03] <Byteflux> So can't really see the appeal to AWS VPN except easier access to AWS resources I guess
[01:22:12] <Sammitch> https://aws.amazon.com/vpn/pricing/#AWS_Client_VPN_pricing seems fixed
[01:22:55] <Sammitch> and that's $72/mo just for the endpoint, $0.05/hr/client to connect

[01:27:21] <Byteflux> Yeah, that is the way to go. AWS Lightsail's offerings are mini-AWS and are nicely priced for smaller deployments that want to scale slowly and cheaply

[01:29:45] <Sammitch> also, going back to the point of cloud providers that scale their pricing down as your usage goes up: Google Cloud does that a lot
[01:30:01] <Byteflux> Their prices also start out much higher than AWS though, IIRC.
[01:30:25] <Sammitch> they're about even for the bedrock compute/storage/etc, IIRC
[01:31:10] <Sammitch> but I recally their sales team _repeatedly_ saying "just keep scaling up until it's free!" despite my eye-rolling

[01:53:45] <Blondie101010> what are read-only properties?  does it mean you can only set them statically?
[01:54:30] <Byteflux> Seems like they are essentially `final` properties if you're familiar with Java.
[01:54:50] <Byteflux> So immutable properties... (ofc Java final properties can be mutated with reflection but we don't talk about that)
[01:56:13] <Byteflux> Since PHP 8.1 will introduce readonly properties, they should also add records (or data classes) too like Java has
[01:57:30] <Byteflux> I guess the constructor property promotion in PHP 8 is already basically like records/dataclasses.
[01:58:50] <Blondie101010> but will it be possible to do something like: $this->property = someFunctionCall();
[01:59:19] <Byteflux> Yes I believe 8.1 is adding that
[01:59:21] <Blondie101010> I'm mostly looking to see where/when it becomes read only
[01:59:46] <Byteflux> So you can initialize properties in the class declaration or as part of the constructor promotion to a non-literal.
[02:00:43] <Byteflux> It becomes read only after it's been initialized

[02:08:46] <sumthing1980> I tried both now, simplexml gives the proper array dom does not
[02:08:49] <Byteflux> SimpleXML is just a half-assed XML parser

[02:09:01] <sumthing1980> 	$dom->loadXML($c);

[02:48:02] <Albright> Yeah, I looked again at the README.md and don't see any mention of it.
[02:48:51] <Byteflux> Symfony's is based on the actual extension in the URI. If you set _format = 'json' on the route, then it expects the path in the URI to be .json

[05:05:25] <Poboy> so nobody
[05:06:15] <__adrian> what part do you not understand?
[05:06:22] <Poboy> $data['foo', 'balls']; is an array I can send from one method to another.  Is that a DTO, what would be the purpose of having a DTO class, what does that even mean?  It's just really strange trying to understand abstracting away so much logic that you have no clue what is actually going on
[05:06:45] <__adrian> that might be called a "data transfer array" if that's how you used it
[05:07:03] <__adrian> you use a DTO to send data from one place to another.
[05:09:34] <da_wunder> and with classes you get autocomplete, real types and so on
[05:10:35] <da_wunder> and with objects you could easily validate those dto's just by using some generic validation library
[05:15:49] <Poboy> So you have $remit, ok this new RemitData, let me go look at that.  RemitData extends DTO and kind of looks like an interface I guess but with properties instead of methods?  Let's go to DTO and see what's happening.  Yeah, this doesn't make much sense to me.  What is the purpose of doing this?  https://kopy.io/xG0wd#line-258
[05:16:57] <__adrian> you get a real schema
[05:17:17] <__adrian> when you have $array, you have nothing. you have to validate it everywhere you use it.
[05:17:49] <__adrian> with a dto, you get properties, types, ease of validation. all those things mentioned above.
[05:18:15] <Poboy> ok, that definitely helps.  Thanks.  I know I can be absurdly dense at times
[05:18:29] <__adrian> np
[05:19:21] <da_wunder> eg. if you've an arrays like `['foo', 123']` and `[123, true]` and those both should present the same "thing" you cannot do that with arrays - with objects you get those types there - and you will see if dto is created by invalid data

[06:39:31] <__adrian> "a php array and turn that to be an object"  do you mean, it's not an array?
[06:39:58] <guy_frm_yogaland> associative array it is, done using json_decode()
[06:40:11] <Byteflux> we can't know that without knowing how the object is created
[06:40:12] <guy_frm_yogaland> with the true parameter set on
[06:40:18] <__adrian> if you decode json as an array, then it's not an object
[06:40:32] <guy_frm_yogaland> yeah
[06:40:38] <__adrian> no, you cannot turn an array into an object.

[06:41:02] <__adrian> you might have a function or class that takes that data and creates an object of a given class using it.
[06:41:11] <guy_frm_yogaland> and I want to loop over the array and turn each array item into an object like new Class()
[06:41:28] <__adrian> see above
[06:41:28] <Byteflux> so do that, pass the data into the class
[06:42:06] <Junxter> turn an array of items into array of objects, can do this in-place
[06:42:33] <guy_frm_yogaland> Junxter: this is what I want to do
[06:42:36] <__adrian> ...again, no.
[06:42:43] <__adrian> you might have a function or class that takes that data and creates an object of a given class using it.
[06:42:47] <Byteflux> we don't know what your class looks like or how it relates to your decoded json data, but it could be as simple as $obj = new Class($item); or $obj = Class::createFromData($item);
[06:43:08] <__adrian> (but it's probably not; most classes aren't designed with that in mind)
[06:43:54] <guy_frm_yogaland> I am using slim framework and it works fine but I am new to the json way of doing data exchange with the frontend
[06:44:03] <guy_frm_yogaland> so stuck in this
[06:44:56] <__adrian> using json is no different than any other transfer mechanism, in that regard. once decoded you have the same data as you would with (for example) urlencoded data
[06:45:28] <__adrian> well, you can do typing better  :)  but there's nothing fundamentally different/special about it
[06:45:38] <Byteflux> using json has no impact on how you create objects or populate objects with information.
[06:45:48] <__adrian> what exactly are you "stuck on"?
[06:46:12] <guy_frm_yogaland> So, I do these steps: 1. fetch file from path, 2. get file contents, 3. json_decode() it, and 4. make it as a array of class objects
[06:46:27] <__adrian> ok...?
[06:46:31] <__adrian> what exactly are you "stuck on"?
[06:47:08] <Byteflux> are you asking how to loop over the json data? o.o
[06:47:19] <guy_frm_yogaland> yeah
[06:47:23] <__adrian> foreach()
[06:47:45] <Byteflux> if it's an array, you loop over like any other array. foreach ($array as $key => $value) { ... }
[06:48:14] <__adrian> e.g.,  foreach (json_decode($json, true) as $data) { make_your_object($data); do_whatever(); }
[06:48:38] <guy_frm_yogaland> ok, let me try this

[06:50:00] <Junxter> no need if just oneline
[06:50:30] <Byteflux> not a matter of "need"
[06:50:44] <guy_frm_yogaland> the object sseks 6 arguments while creating an object because it needs 6 parameters
[06:50:55] <__adrian> Junxter: use { braces }. omitting them makes for error-prone code
[06:51:21] <__adrian> guy_frm_yogaland: for each item in your array of data, your function would need to validate that the appropriate values exist
[06:51:34] <Junxter> in real code i would actually do    foreach($a as $k=>$v) $a[$k] = call_user_func(function () use ($v){   ......      });
[06:51:39] <Junxter> omitted for illustration purpose
[06:51:47] <__adrian> can't just blindly assume it's there and correct.
[06:54:08] <Byteflux> if this is for a class you don't control, then you could just make a function which takes as its input an "item" of JSON data and does stuff to validate (and/or sanitize) the item contents which you can then pass as arguments to the class you want to instanciate
[06:54:21] <__adrian> ^

[06:56:24] <guy_frm_yogaland> here is the json data inside the file

[08:00:56] <__adrian> https://php.net/list
[08:00:58] <Byteflux> not knowing does not mean it's complicated
[08:01:16] <__adrian> it's a basic construct. a good thing to know about.
[08:01:45] <__adrian> even aside from that,  why would you need  $key=>$value  in order to do  $value["left"]  ?
[08:01:56] <__adrian> you're not using the $key at all, why assign it?
[08:02:25] <__adrian> why *do you want to
[08:03:11] <Byteflux> if you do foreach ($a as $key=>$value) { ... } then $key is just going to be 0, 1, 2, etc.
[08:03:21] <__adrian> formatting might help it seem less complicated also  https://paste.ofcode.org/35bxUxBByjg4YHFF2BfxWQm

[08:07:08] <__adrian> your array has no keys 0, 1, 2
[08:07:12] <Byteflux> because 0, 1 and 2 aren't the keys
[08:07:19] <Byteflux> the keys are 'left', 'middle' and 'right'
[08:07:30] <Byteflux> if you have control over the array's structure, you can restructure it to make that work
[08:07:52] <Byteflux> $a = [[1, 2, 3], [2, 4, 6], [3, 6, 9]];

[13:50:15] <Eugen80> alright, it is working, but how can I get the result?
[13:50:57] <Eugen80> $dom->saveHTML() gives me not the original (+replaces) but something new
[13:55:22] <Eugen80> now it has DOCTYPE, html, body tags..
[13:56:54] <TinoDidriksen> Oh, you're using it on a fragment? Then you want to only save that node.
[13:58:12] <TinoDidriksen> But if it's a fragment, then it should be valid XML.
[13:58:27] <TinoDidriksen> What exactly are you trying to feed it?
[13:59:34] <Eugen80> TinoDidriksen: my fragment has also some JS
[13:59:53] <TinoDidriksen> Inside a <a> tag? Why?
[13:59:58] <Eugen80> no
[14:00:58] <Eugen80> i try to load with $dom->loadHTML() piece of html (with JS), find all <a> and modify hrefs
[14:01:43] <TinoDidriksen> But the example code only loaded exactly the <a> tag that you wanted to modify, which is why loadXML() worked.
[14:02:01] <TinoDidriksen> If you have larger fragments, it's a whole other story.
[14:02:28] <Eugen80> yes.. it is quite large fragment
[14:02:52] <TinoDidriksen> Personally, I would still use preg_replace, just with a simpler regex.
[14:04:11] <TinoDidriksen> There's also preg_replace_callback() which lets you do more logic regarding when/what to replace.
[14:05:56] <Eugen80> yes.. I was not sure if preg_replace would be enough

[14:12:32] <TinoDidriksen> preg_replace() is enough for your case.
[14:12:56] <TinoDidriksen> But it's generally bad code to use regex for XML/HTML. Only use regex if you know your markup.

[17:56:07] <freeman_h> Hi again, when doing this https://3v4l.org/SfQYT which is basically a search is it possible to do only return 10 results and then get the next set of result when needed? Basically I dont want to query the db for all the results at once
[17:57:18] <Naktibalda> you mean "pagination", right?
[17:57:27] <freeman_h> Naktibalda: yes
[17:58:07] <Naktibalda> yes, if you return all of them in the same request, no - if you have to make new HTTP request to load the next page.
[17:58:36] <freeman_h> Naktibalda: yes how can i do this in pdo please
[17:59:19] <Naktibalda> LIMIT 0, 10 first time,   LIMIT 10,10 second time and so one
[18:04:50] <g0z> hm I didn't know about that format for LIMIT I use OFFSET instead
[18:05:43] <Byteflux> `LIMIT offset, length` is specific to MySQL, if I remember.
[18:06:27] <g0z> good to know.
[18:09:05] <Byteflux> `LIMIT limit OFFSET offset` also works in MySQL but will also work in some others like Postgres.
[18:09:36] <Byteflux> So probably a better choice if you need compatibility or want to minimize how much implementation-specific SQL you have to write.
[18:12:50] <Byteflux> Also note that offsetting gets progressively slower the larger it gets, because the database has to still manually count and skip that many rows. So not ideal for situations where you might have more than a thousand pages or so depending on how many results per page you show.
[18:14:34] <Naktibalda> !t freeman_h offsets
[18:14:56] <Byteflux> What do you think this is? #mysql?! :)
[18:15:15] <Naktibalda> yeah, why do you talk sql in here?
[18:15:17] <Naktibalda>  The major problem with offset for pagination is that LIMIT has to read all the rows in order to get to the offset and then select up to the limit. With id > $last_max_id LIMIT x (used within the app) it only has to scan/order those rows > than the id's already passed.
[18:16:32] <Byteflux> ^ Yep, this is the way to go when you need to start paginating large tables.

[21:24:05] <da_wunder> haven't tried that alpine image, but I've been using php:8.0.9-fpm without problems - maybe you should explain your actual issue a bit more
[21:24:59] <skyfaller> I just don't know what I'm doing. I have it working on Ubuntu and Arch Linux with a unix socket, but on Alpine it has listen = 127.0.0.1:9000 by default, and when I tell my Caddy web server to look there, it doesn't seem to do anything, I just get a 404
[21:25:37] <da_wunder> do you expose that 9000 port?
[21:26:02] <skyfaller> ok, that's probably the problem. I guess the firewall needs to be open even if the request is coming from the same machine
[21:26:18] *** Joins: DevAntoine (~DevAntoin@78.196.234.32)
[21:26:30] <skyfaller> can I just change it to look for an arbitrary unix socket? I don't really understand what a unix socket is, but if it means i don't have to open my firewall, that seems good
[21:26:32] <Rockwood> you should chk port too
[21:27:15] <Byteflux> Docker containers within the same bridged network can talk to each other without needing to expose ports.
[21:28:03] <skyfaller> this isn't a Docker container, in this case
[21:29:27] <Byteflux> I may have missed some earlier discussion (not seeing my scrollback for some reason) but you're running php-fpm in a Docker container or something else?
[21:29:57] <skyfaller> I'm just running it on a Linode virtual machine, not containerized
[21:30:08] <Byteflux> Oh I see.
[21:30:14] <Byteflux> Does Linode have private networking?
[21:30:20] <da_wunder> I though that skyfaller was using docker container there, just by that naming :D
[21:30:52] <Byteflux> Well I guess I don't fully understand the issue either.
