[01:43:58] <borodust> artchad: alien-works is a next-gen but also conventional system for game development unlike cl-bodge which is an experimental one through and through
[01:44:37] <borodust> artchad: but it's very recent and pre alpha quality
[01:45:27] <borodust> for notalone-thriced it's better to go with binaries
[01:46:12] <borodust> since it was published for game jam code a bit desynced between alien-works and the game
[01:46:59] <borodust> aw is a huge step up from cl-bodge as you might see fr9m notalone-thriced :)
[01:47:53] <borodust> i'm in the process of porting notalone 3d onto android
[01:48:40] <borodust> once that's done - i'll push everything and you will be able to run it from source
[01:48:51] <borodust> not in openbsd though

[02:40:05] <artchad> interesting interesting
[02:42:15] <artchad> I've moved out of the city into a small village. Had a lot of things to deal with. 
[02:42:27] <artchad> But now I have more time than ever. I think.
[02:42:55] <artchad> I'll surely make some games now.
