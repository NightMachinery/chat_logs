[14:07:04] <earnestly> I want to mkdir from awk, using "mkdir ..." thing | getline is what I'm doing but I'm not sure how you'd close this close("mkdir ..." thing)?  I wish system() just did execve instead of sh
[14:07:28] <earnestly> Is there a better way of doing this, or must the command be assigned to a string
[14:09:24] <earnestly> Nevermind, | getline is sh too
[14:21:45] <earnestly> Fortunately sh is pretty easy to escape, but this is awful :D
[14:25:28] <emanuele6> :D
[14:26:48] <emanuele6> you don't need to close("mkdir ...") if you used system("mkdir ...")

[14:28:25] <emanuele6> s/don't need to/should not/
[14:40:29] <earnestly> Probably
[14:40:42] <earnestly> It's so ugly
[14:41:34] <earnestly> https://0x0.st/-nIJ.txt
[14:42:01] <emanuele6> it should be: system(cmd)
[14:42:05] <emanuele6> and you don't need close()
[14:42:07] <earnestly> Yeah, without the quotes
[14:42:32] <earnestly> Oh good I can remove the cmd = variable
[14:43:42] <emanuele6> you only need to close() `"cmd ..."|' and `|"cmd ..."' because they create a pipe
[14:43:43] <earnestly> I could probably implement xargs/find {} + using ARG_MAX and passing in sizes of environment and such but nah.
[14:44:13] <earnestly> Until that matters I won't worry
[14:45:16] <earnestly> Another approach is to use a while read loop instead of awk, that could work 
[14:45:43] <earnestly> It's just that the awk is useful to escape things for curl which I'd otherwise have to use sed for
[14:46:15] <earnestly> Anyway, this is fine for now.  Might need to redesign things because of curl, but oh well
[14:51:21] <emanuele6> what do you need to escape for curl?
[14:51:36] <emanuele6> do you know about `-g' and `--form-string'?
[14:56:33] <earnestly> emanuele6: curl's config file
[14:56:40] <earnestly> So not url encoding
[14:56:58] <earnestly> header "if there are spaces and \" quotes"
[14:57:12] <emanuele6> ah, i see
