[21:08:13] <fendor[m]> karim: In the docs folder, there is a document for the basic HLS architecture. It depends a bit on what you want to do how relevant that is
[21:08:24] <fendor[m]> if you have specific questions, I suggest asking them here instead
[21:09:16] <fendor[m]> In my experience, upgrading the support GHC versions takes at least some knowledge of GHC's API, but I don't that much knowledge about HLS
[21:09:24] <fendor[m]> * I don't think that much
[21:11:25] <fendor[m]> I don't think you need a lot of experience, but it will certainly help a lot. API changes are sometimes mysterious without some knowledge about the why and what the goal for the change was
[21:12:41] <fendor[m]> if you want to take on that project, you will most likely spent most of your time on ghcide, as it implements the important stuff, such as parsing, typechecking, warnings, etc...
