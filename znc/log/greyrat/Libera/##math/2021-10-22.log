[02:10:11] <damo22> if you put a vertical line down the y axis and sweep it across from left to right you should only hit one value at a time
[02:10:16] <somiaj> hajonnes: solution of a x^2?
[02:10:28] <damo22> then f(x) is a function right?
[02:10:29] <hajonnes> somiaj i.e. what is x.
[02:10:40] <cuppajoeman> Thanks som
[02:10:51] <somiaj> hajonnes: still you don't have solutions to expressions, you need an equation. It helps to be a little more detailed with statments.
[02:11:43] <somiaj> and if you want to talk about functions you still need to define a domain and codomain, it is possible to define an inverse (many in fact) to the function x->x^2, depending on what you choose for the domain and codomain.
[02:12:21] <hajonnes> somiaj, I just mean that solving a x^2 gives two possiblities (x=+ sqr(), x=- sqr())which a funciton can never have.
[02:12:34] * mornfall tries to remember where \mapsto is on his keyboard
[02:12:35] <somiaj> hajonnes: you cannot 'solve a x^2', because you cannot solve expressions

[02:14:31] <hajonnes> the solution of a second degree equation can not be a function... is that wrong?
[02:14:41] <somiaj> x^2 is not an equation
[02:15:07] <cuppajoeman> When we already have a function (but don't know it yet), and we perform the check It seems very odd somiaj , say we're checking if f(x) = x is well defined, so we assume x = a and x = b, and now we need to show a = b?
[02:15:22] <somiaj> and depending on your domain and codomain, you can make solutions to x^2 = y a function, the common restriction is known as sqrt(x) is which is a function.
[02:15:45] <mornfall> (and solutions to quadratic equations are not functions but numbers)
[02:16:14] <damo22> put a horizontal line across the function and move it down the axes, if you ever hit 2 x values with the same y value, then the function has no inverse because the inverse function would need to have two y values for the same x
[02:16:16] <somiaj> cuppajoeman: it can vary a bit, a lot depends on how you define the function.
[02:16:47] <damo22> its simple like that in R^2
[02:17:04] <somiaj> damo22: although useful for functions from R->R, not all functions are defined on that domain/codomain, and often times you can restrict things so you do have an inverse function. Look at sqrt(x), arcsin, arccos, arctan, etc
[02:17:42] <mornfall> cuppajoeman: what you are checking is whether there are y₁, y₂ such that y₁ ≠ y₂ though f(x) = y₁ and f(x) = y₂ both come out as true (for some fixed x)
[02:17:44] <hajonnes> somiaj, yes that is a point.
[02:18:46] <mornfall> (and then there's partial functions \o/…)
[02:18:54] <damo22> alternatively, put a mirror on the line y=x and reflect your function f(x) about that line, if the function is still defined, then it has an inverse
[02:19:02] <somiaj> or relations if you want a more general object
[02:19:08] <hajonnes> mornfall yes.
[02:19:29] <cuppajoeman> Let m_n: {1, 2, 3, ..., n} -> {0, 1} , then I define a function f, so that f(m_n) = m_(n-1) where m_(n-1) (x) = m_n(x) for all x in {1, 2, 3, ..., n-1} . somiaj, how do I go about showing this is well defined?

[02:23:11] <cuppajoeman> correct

[02:24:30] <cuppajoeman> Yes, that's my confusing, I map f( ... ) to exactly one thing
[02:24:37] <cuppajoeman> Why do I even need to check anything?
[02:26:05] <mornfall> cuppajoeman: the cases where you need to be concerned are, for instance, when you take f : X → X, then take some [f] : [X] → [X] where […] is the set of equivalence classes for some relation on X (and the natural extension to f)

[02:28:56] <somiaj> othertimes you are working in a context like a relation between two sets where it may not be as clear the definition of your function is well-defined, in that case it is useful to verify it

[03:03:39] <mornfall> but there are obviously infinitely many functions with the property you asked for
[03:03:50] <somiaj> cuppajoeman: well a cricle isn't a function, but if you took the standard parameterization, f: [0,2pi) -> R^2 given by t -> (r*cos(t), r*sin(t)), you get an injective function onto the circle, which will have an inverse function that stretches it back into the line [0,2pi)
[03:04:23] <somiaj> though as mentioned this is just one way, but the basicaly idea is you can cut the circle at a point, and stretch it into an line similar to a half-open interval
[03:05:09] <somiaj> If you want to turn it into a closed interval/line segement, this is still possible, but it won't be contionous, here just think of a map between [0,1] and [0,2pi)

[06:09:23] <isekaijin> But you can use L'Hôpital instead of taking logarithms, of course.
[06:09:57] <gganbu> well 300 log(k) - k log(2) goes to -infinity
[06:10:16] <isekaijin> 300 log(k) - k log(2) decreases monotonically because its derivative is 300/k - log(2), which is negative for sufficiently large k.
[06:10:25] <isekaijin> Now, the logarithm itself is also a monotonic function.
[06:10:35] <gganbu> so that limit doesn't exist
[06:11:17] <gganbu> or at least its indeterminate form
[06:11:34] <isekaijin> Wait.
[06:11:53] <isekaijin> I just proved that k^300 / 2^k is (eventually) monotonically decreasing.
[06:12:06] <gganbu> right, for sufficiently large k

[06:15:11] <somiaj> gganbu: though not the only way as isekaijin is showing, but with L'Hoptial's you should have gotten lim_(k->inf) 300!/( ln(2)^300 * 2^k )

[06:16:25] <isekaijin> somiaj: Sounds like a pain to calculate.
[06:16:57] <isekaijin> For practical purposes, you have to set k^d / 2^k and use induction to compute the d-th derivatives of the numerator and denominator.
[06:17:03] <somiaj> It really isn't that bad, no reason to have to compute each of the 300 derivative, but the result is fairly clear.
[06:17:37] *** Joins: Julian (~tos9@python/site-packages/Julian)
[06:17:48] <somiaj> should be clear that 300 derivatives of k^300 is just 300!, and each derivative of 2^k is ln(2) * 2^k, so from there you get ln(2)^300 * 2^k after 300 derivatives
[06:18:05] <isekaijin> Using induction itself is something many calculus students struggle with. Although gganbu just asked a CS question, so gganbu is probably better at induction than the typical calculus student.
[06:19:02] <somiaj> though I think your making your method to complicated if the lim ln(a_k) = -inf, then lim a_k = 0 by the continuity of ln(x).
[06:19:29] <somiaj> here you have to assume a_k > 0 for all k, which it is in this case
[06:20:01] <isekaijin> I really just want to say that log is defined on [0, \infty) if we allow it to take values on [-\infty, \infty).
[06:20:44] <isekaijin> Of course, I cannot literally say that to a calculus student, because that would deprive calculus teachers of a tool to torture students.
[06:20:57] <isekaijin> And the whole point to calculus courses is torturing students.
[06:21:12] <blueberrycrop> well prove it
[06:21:43] <isekaijin> So we have to dance lots of silly dances around the fact that a sequence of positive numbers x_n goes to 0 if and only if log(x_n) goes to -\infty.
[06:22:01] <int-e> . o ( k^300/2^k = (k/(2^(1/300))^k)^300, now show that k/(2^(1/300))^k approaches 0 as k approaches infinity )

[11:51:30] <rubiksdream> hi, i think im likely missing something obvious, im interested in why its always possible to find a monic polynomial of some fixed degree k, whose maximum modulus on some fixed compact set E (of the complex plane) is as small as can be for all monic polynomials of degree k
[11:52:05] <rubiksdream> i think this is easy to see when E is infinite and compact, since then the space of all monic polynomials of degree k on this set is isomorphic to C^k with a different norm, so we can apply bolzano weierstrass
[11:52:50] <rubiksdream> but when E is finite, I can only conclude that when the size of E is less than or equal to k, the answer is zero and there will be candidate polynomials of degree k that are zero everywhere on E
[11:53:08] <rubiksdream> how can I conclude this when E is finite and its size is greater than the degree k?

The fact that 7^2 != 1 (mod 10) shows you it must be 4. That is, 7 is a primitive root mod 10.

[17:54:00] <switchnode> given n observations classified into k mutually exclusive classes and a target alpha, if the expected frequency of each class i is some p_i/m * n (with p_i and m integers), what is the smallest m necessary for there to be an assignment p_1 ... p_k such that the pearson's goodness of fit is above alpha (and how do you find such an assignment)?

[19:59:58] <joel135> Galois: i don't know
[20:00:46] <Galois> all right, let's draw a picture. What does Q look like geometrically?
[20:00:53] <joel135> my usual picture of Q is just a point
[20:01:00] <Galois> ok, that's not the correct picture here
[20:01:09] <joel135> and Q[x] would be a line for me
[20:01:16] <joel135> what's correct then?
[20:01:18] <Galois> we should interpret Q as Spec(Z)
[20:01:30] <joel135> so use Z instead of Q?
[20:01:46] <Galois> yes, because geometry happens in rings of integers
[20:01:47] <|smlckz|> riv: this is a one page pdf, solving a mcq question: Let f : R → R, g : R → R, and h : R → R be differentiable functions such that f(x) = x^3 + 3x + 2, g(f(x)) = x,
[20:01:48] <|smlckz|> and h(g(g(x))) = x for all x ∈ R. Then 4 options..
[20:02:06] <Galois> likewise we should view Q(sqrt2) as Z[sqrt2]
[20:02:44] <Galois> you can insist on treating Q as a point, but it's just not very interesting
[20:02:44] <joel135> indeed, it seems like Spec(Q) and and Spec(Q[sqrt(2)]) are both singletons, so not very interesting geometrically
[20:02:58] <joel135> ok, let's use Z then
[20:03:08] <Galois> so Spec(Z) is basically a line of primes
[20:03:14] <Galois> 2 3 5 7 11 13 17 19 23 ...

[20:04:14] <Galois> no, ramifies is more specific
[20:04:20] <joel135> ok

[20:11:59] <Galois> for the picture you have to arrange the primes in a number line with 2 at the origin
[20:12:26] <Galois> ... 29 19 13 11 5 3 2 7 17 23 37 ...
[20:12:26] <joel135> ok
[20:12:36] <Galois> everything to the left of 2 is inert primes
[20:12:40] <Galois> everything to the right of 2 is split primes
[20:12:55] <Galois> so that's the picture of Spec Z
[20:13:15] <Galois> now, when you draw Spec Z[sqrt2], it's a _parabola_ sitting on its side with the vertex at 2

[20:16:57] <joel135> yes, and you then have to classify into inert vs splitting, i would imagine
[20:17:03] <Galois> x-1 is prime in K. y^2-1 is not: it factors into (y-1)(y+1)
[20:17:08] <Galois> y-1 is the point (1,1)
[20:17:12] <Galois> y+1 is the point (1,-1)
[20:17:33] <Galois> in case it's not clear, I'm taking x-1 and x=y^2 to get y^2-1
[20:17:45] <Galois> similarly, x is prime in K. y^2 is no prime. y^2 is _ramified_
[20:17:54] <Galois> so you get the vertex at (0,0) with a vertical tangent
[20:18:06] <Galois> I meant "y^2 is not prime"

[21:41:48] <somiaj> [itchyjunk]: so yes your answer to (a) is correct, and your answer to (b) can be found in a similar fashion.

[21:42:40] <riv> no
[21:43:10] <riv> a singularity of f(z) would be a zero of 1/f(z)
[21:43:15] <somiaj> [itchyjunk]: Polynomials (on z) are already anaylititc, and due to the quotient rule, ratios of analytic functions are analytic everywhere the denominator is non-zero.

[23:33:53] <quartz> switchnode: OK thanks. Need to eat my food now.
[23:34:07] <riv> it's the same as saying the function f(x) = e^x - x is always non-negative and we know f(1) = 0 is non-negative

[23:34:28] <riv> and indeed the slope of this function is positive, since f'(x) = e^x > 0

[23:35:25] <switchnode> quartz: you're welcome :)
[23:36:44] <cuppajoeman> thanks for help!
[23:36:48] <cuppajoeman> I see it now

[23:42:06] <cherim> Slope e^x - 1 and not e^x though, also need monotonicity (for f'). This is essentially the convexity argument
[23:42:51] <riv> oops, thanks cherim. I need to be more careful
