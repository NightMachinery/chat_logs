[00:58:53] <nickspoon> I've got gateron browns on mine and have always liked them. But I have never had others to compare with
[00:59:11] <nickspoon> Brown is nice because there is a tactile bump when it actuates

[01:10:08] <jdavfsxd> it was really amusing the first time I switched from browns to reds, I used to lightly rest the fingers on the keyboard, and when switching to reds I often caught myself typing unwanted keys due to the weight I was putting on fingers, which was a nonissue on the brown switches.

[01:23:04] <jdavfsxd> I remember razor as ref on orange, which is not usual, I thought keychrons would follow their design.
[01:23:06] <ccx> Just… unpleasant to type on. Part of it's it's layout for sure, but also the keys are fairly hard to get moving and once they do they bottom out almost immediately.
[01:23:30] <[not]nova> the keychron reds look good to me. I almost want the whites.
[01:23:40] <jdavfsxd> ccx: hard depends on the color too

[01:24:41] <[not]nova> also the mint/banana have nice names, but I don't quite know what "early tactile bump" means. I am on brown right now, and I can't understand how they would compare to an earlier tactile bump
[01:24:52] <ccx> The low-profile Cherrys aren't distinguished by colour IIRC, they have some kind of two letter codes instead.
[01:25:00] <jdavfsxd> hmmm

[10:29:34] <mags> What's up with f and t?  If I go `fX` the cursor jumps to the next X, `fX` again to the next X.  If I go `tX` the cursor jumps to before the next X, but then `tX` again does not move to before the next X.
[10:30:58] <osse> mags: I don't have a good answer for that, but there is a dedicated "repeat last fTfT-whatever" key that you can use, that behaves as expected
[10:31:03] <osse> tX;;;

[15:43:06] <sathiana> Hello all, I take notes using Markdown in vim, but there some annoying issues with syntax highlight and Markdown ## HEADINGs being hidden inside the previous ### HEADINGs. It happens when embeding code, like : ```go golangCodeHere ```, and I have heard that vim uses grepping? for syntax highlight, could it be that some special symbols are the cause of inconsistence in the syntax, and is there anything that can be done ? I have an image 
[15:43:06] <sathiana> showing the issue: https://imgur.com/a/dZIMyHS
[15:47:28] <joo-_> dont know the answer, but do You know how to sort the markdown by header in vim ?

[19:27:11] <jdavfsxd> I prefer 07:CocInstall or 07g:coc_global_extensions as it doesn't need the extensions to be built from their sources, which is needed when picking extensions with vim-plug, and as there can be many extensions used, it's too much stuff to build imo.

[19:43:40] <[not]nova> mehwork: with your own command (like :TabF[ind]) yeah, but it's complicated because tabs aren't named like buffers. But you can also do like :2tabn to go to tab 2
[19:46:57] <[not]nova> also, :TabFind would be ... not easy ... because it's not easy to grab the bufname()s from each collection of windows in each tab. hmm
[19:47:56] <[not]nova> oh. :h tabpagebuflist()
[19:48:37] <[not]nova> meh nvm. idk you'd have to search around and maybe there's a succint function
[19:49:13] <[not]nova> (ps 2gt is shorthand for :2tabn)
[19:50:50] <[not]nova> the help for tabpagebuflist threw me off. it looks like it could assist
[19:52:30] <mehwork> ok thanks, i def want the substring behavior over just numbers

If multiple tabs have it, it shows a list of numbers, type one to go to that tab - I didn't check if it's in the original list lol. Use :TabFind! bar to go to the first one matching 'bar'.
