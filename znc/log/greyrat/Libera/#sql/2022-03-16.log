[15:26:55] <Guest5497> are there any performance benefits to combining multiple inserts into one? https://stackoverflow.com/questions/452859/inserting-multiple-rows-in-a-single-sql-query
[15:39:45] *** Joins: synthmeat (~synthmeat@user/synthmeat)
[15:49:14] <Guest5497> I'm trying to understand the perf. benefit of doing multiple inserts in a single commit, a single insert (with multiple values) in a single commit. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8635818/multiple-insert-statements-vs-single-insert-with-multipl... Some of the answers are totally confusing - the benchmark shows the former is faster, but the
[15:49:15] <Guest5497> answers claim it's not surprising the latter is faster because blah blah.  https://stackoverflow.com/a/8635891 Can someone help me understand this?
[15:58:35] <Xgc> Guest5497: This is very database specific. In general, however, there can be a parse procedure for each statement.  You will avoid the N parses when combining into one statement.  Then you have possible transactional differences... and even here, there could be a difference based on deferred constraints (or not).  Bottom line, test your performance. Lots of things could have an impact.
[15:59:44] <Xgc> Guest5497: Lean toward one statement instead of N.  Lean toward one source query instead of N source terms.
[16:00:12] <Guest5497> Xgc ah ok, thanks for clarifying. Just to understand the part about transactions differences - not sure I understand. Let's say I do the multiple inserts in a single commit. Does it still come into play?

[16:01:48] <Xgc> Guest5497: Well, if you have one insert ... select ...;  that's guaranteed to all run within one transaction.   INSERT ...;  INSERT ...;  is not, depending on the database.  Make sure you're comparing "like for like" cases.
[16:02:33] <thumbs> a large INSERT ... SELECT (millions of rows) can also have negative impacts on the system
[16:02:54] <Xgc> Guest5497: If the single commit does terminate the entire operation (one transaction), that tends to be best (one transaction).  But even that has exceptions.
[16:03:17] <Xgc> Exactly.
[16:03:33] <Guest5497> ok thanks for the guidance folks

[16:07:02] <Xgc> Guest5497: Any triggers need to be take into account as well.  Don't just look at the inserts alone.
[16:08:02] <Xgc> or other conflicting transactions, of course.
[16:08:06] <thumbs> also, you will have to rebuild some indexes with INSERT depending on the rdbms

[16:09:24] <Xgc> Guest5497: Sounds like a poor test.
[16:10:07] <Xgc> Guest5497: You can draw bad conclusions easily if you don't understand the reasons.
[16:10:19] <thumbs> an extended insert, or bulk insert via INSERT ... SELECT or LOAD DATA can usually yield 5-10x speed improvements
[16:11:06] <thumbs> I cannot imagine any scenario where individual statements are faster, other than a grossly misconfigured server
[16:11:10] <Xgc> Guest5497: Be careful to perform most testing outside your favorite language, with the native SQL tools provided by your database.
[16:16:37] <Xgc> Guest5497: Any specific database could have poor performance for some common case.  The suggestion by that poster was that each constant term of the VALUES clause might be handled separately by the optimizer.  Maybe 11 years ago that bug existed.
[16:18:55] <Xgc> Watch for those kinds of "bugs" (unexpected behavior).  You may, from time to time, need to do something odd to avoid them.  Don't draw general conclusions from them.

[17:15:25] <Xgc> Guest5497: Depends on your configuration / environment / database.  Without the explicit transactional boundary, it's possible you're operating in an auto_commit mode, which would likely perform much worse than having one transaction for the entire thing.  Note that a very very large transaction can have behavior you won't see in smaller transactions.
[17:15:27] <Bushcat> secondly, in phpmyadmin, database tab on top, it says no privilege 
[17:16:01] <Xgc> Guest5497: So the "larger is better" does not always apply.
[17:17:00] <syco> Bushcat, "says no privileg" i guess you'll have to set the privileges "manually"
[17:17:46] <syco> i've had similar problems with the phpmyadmin package from devuan/debian
[17:17:47] <Bushcat> syco,  i have privilege in MariaDB server, so for example if I go to MariaDB server from mysql client, all works fine 
[17:17:57] <Bushcat> yes I am in Debian 
[17:19:00] <syco> works fine for me with debian11 and devuan4
