[00:33:43] <tk> it's quite short but I don't know anything about vim plugins. I've installed it using Plug and the RetabIndent function is there but functions such as StabsTab don't appear and the plugin appears generally non-functional
[00:33:58] <romainl> maybe its author would be glad to help you solve your problems via their issue tracker?
[00:34:28] <tk> Yeah, maybe, but I was hoping for a quicker answer.
[00:35:33] <tk> here, let me rephrase my question: is there any documentation on how to debug vimscripts in vim?
[00:35:45] <tk> alternatively, any documentation on writing a plugin?
[00:35:46] <romainl> vimgor: XY
[00:35:47] <vimgor> XY is asking about your attempted solution rather than your actual problem. E.g. you want to kill flies and think of a laser with a targeting system. You have a laser from a CD ROM, so you ask about a targeting system and get no useful replies. If you'd asked about flies you'd been directed towards chemical methods and eventually solved your problem. http://meta.stackexchange.com/a/66378/181948

[20:21:42] <sstutz> actually..no
[20:22:11] <puremourning> i know of at least 4, 2 of which nonfunctional, 2 of which seemingly very slow.
[20:22:28] <sstutz> theres this one I wanted to try out the other day
[20:22:28] <romainl> I count 4 on the official page
[20:22:38] <puremourning> i mean, i get it, it's hard in fully dynanmic languages
[20:22:40] <romainl> plus one for phpunit
[20:22:48] <shgvbvri> intelephense-docs is reported to be way faster than php-language-server, there's also psalm.
[20:23:10] <puremourning> i was never able to get intelephense to work at all
[20:23:10] <sstutz> ah thats the one
[20:23:30] <sstutz> vim-lsp-config is supposed to support it out of the box puremourning 
[20:23:34] <sstutz> just saying
[20:23:50] <puremourning> i don't...
[20:24:04] <sstutz> you don't.. use vim-lsp?
[20:24:15] <puremourning> i'm literally the maintainer of YouCompelteMe
[20:24:23] <puremourning> my choice of lsp client is made for me :)
[20:24:35] <shgvbvri> there's also coc-phpls for intelephense, should work out of the box as well
[20:24:42] <sstutz> well then I guess you could still check out there repo and see how they've configured t
[20:24:51] <puremourning> that wasn't the problem iirc
[20:25:08] <shgvbvri> and coc-psalm
[20:25:18] * puremourning shakes head slowly
[20:25:49] <sstutz> because throwing node into the mix tends to speed things up eh
[20:26:15] <shgvbvri> faster than python :)
[20:26:34] <shgvbvri> and less problematic
[20:26:45] <shgvbvri> also less startuptime

[20:58:13] <puremourning> i'm thinking of inventing the YX or BA problem

[20:58:25] <puremourning> where 90% of "answers" on the computer-people internet don't actually answer the question the person posted
[20:59:17] <puremourning> like in /r/vim. (atypical) question "How can i set the guihl for a syntax group to override my colourscheme?"
[20:59:27] <sstutz> well to be fair you haven't really explained to us *how* its brokwn

[21:01:20] <puremourning> it does't matter why i don't want it (though i think i vaguely explained that it doesn't do what i want it to and it's extremely slow)
