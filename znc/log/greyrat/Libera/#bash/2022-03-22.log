[01:00:18] <Soliton> for a serious long-term solution sed is definitely not it.
[01:00:29] <escherial> basically something that matches class [^M] down to the part where the class ends (which is typically a newline, nothing, and a newline) and removes it would be fine
[01:00:33] <escherial> right
[01:00:38] <escherial> but, like, this is a stopgap at best
[01:01:15] <escherial> anyway, sorry, never mind. i guess i got my answer, so thanks for your time
[01:01:34] <Soliton> sed is line based so matching on two consecutive empty lines is not great either.
[01:01:50] <Soliton> you'd need to loop...

[01:02:52] <escherial> afaik you can have regexes that span lines, no?
[01:02:55] <Soliton> if you must: sed -E -e '/^class [^M].*\(.*\):/{' -e :a -e 'N;/^.*\n\n$/!ba' -e 's/^/# removed /gm' -e '}'
[01:03:16] <Soliton> the gm part is GNU sed but you don't need it if you just want to remove.

[01:03:36] <OnlineCop> When I need to have regexes that span lines, I end up using `-z` (grep) or `-0` (perl) so the "entire file" is read in at once, newlines and all.
[01:04:00] <Soliton> you can have whatever regexes you want which will do nothing if you don't have the data to match against.
[01:04:43] <Soliton> in the above sed script the N command is used to read in multiple lines.

[03:58:52] <Codaraxis> Not entirely sure if this is the right place.. but is it possible to set up aliases or environment variables or setting in Bash so that  cd .../foo  transforms into  cd ../../foo  ? At the moment, as a hack, I have an environment variable, so that  $lll/foo  does it.

[04:06:30] <koala_man> ah. Yeah no I don't think I would try to change that. Cygwin has been trying to handle Windows paths for 20 years and it's still a crapshoot

How could I take the result of the glob pattern and remove all items matching a certain pattern?  e.g. "$dir"/*.x excluding files matching "$dir"/foo_*.x

[10:19:05] <mattf> go to line 40 actually, this triggers, isn't "found" when i run the script
[10:19:56] <mattf> is that declare thing and then calling with ./triggers a thing that worked on older bash versions?
[10:20:27] <larryv> ''declare -A''? no
[10:21:02] <ormaaj> Did I put that there? I would have put it at the top of the file if I needed it.
[10:22:07] <mattf> Geir Hauge
[10:22:19] <ormaaj> no clue why it's there.
[10:22:29] <mattf> but yes : ./evalcmd: line 48: ./triggers: No such file or directory

[10:23:26] <mattf> what do you mean

[17:44:17] <ormaaj> Doubt. They clearly allow arbitrary code fragments as templates since they show an example with [[ ]]... Unless it can parse it and test well-formedness they're screwed. They're screwed either way since bash itself makes it more or less impossible to correctly escape certain things like associative array keys.

[17:50:04] <ormaaj> dka: the command looks fine and I don't see a glaring issue in the script (other than the ugly set -e at the top). Might want to `exec --`, though exec doesn't take long options and most implementations probably only scan options up to the first non-option word it's not a bad idea.

[19:13:17] <OnlineCop> !csv
[19:13:18] <greybot> Comma Separated Values: a format that stores data as records composed of fields, usually comma-delimited. Documented by RFC4180, though implementations vary. Utilities such as sed, grep and cut are not suitable for parsing it. Instead, use csvline (from http://to.lhunath.com/bashlib), csvtool, csvkit, csv (Python), Text::CSV (Perl) etc.
[19:14:09] <OnlineCop> If csvquote is a good alternative, I think having it mentioned in !csv might be useful.
[19:15:32] *** Joins: labrador (~labrador@user/labrador)
[19:15:59] <Masklin> Suppose I want to copy the file I find with find
[19:16:15] <Masklin> It's exec something {}; something?
[19:16:24] <OnlineCop> `find ... -exec cp {} destination/` perhaps?
[19:16:35] <OnlineCop> Don't forget the trailing `\;` after it. Whoops.
[19:17:16] <ormaaj> -exec cp -- {}
[19:17:24] <Earnestly> I appreciate GNU cp's -t for this
[19:17:36] <Earnestly> So to make + usable rather than ;
[19:17:51] <Masklin> I'm confused
[19:17:56] <Masklin> Is it + or \ or -t ?
[19:17:56] <ormaaj> file name probably will end up with leading directories anyway
[19:18:20] <OnlineCop> Masklin: Are you using GNU cp? It has `cp -t /dest src1 src2 src3 ...`
[19:18:27] <osse> Masklin: + or \;     -t is an option to cp
[19:18:32] <OnlineCop> `find ... -exec cp -t dest {} \+`
[19:18:35] <Earnestly> Masklin: \ is just quoting ; so that the shell doesn't interpret it as command terminator
