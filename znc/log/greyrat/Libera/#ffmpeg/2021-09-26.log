[01:22:42] <fakuve> Hi guys , I have recorded 3 takes to join in one single video , the issue is that one of the takes had to be rotated 180 degrees
[01:23:25] <fakuve> So when joining them together at the end , seems that I'm having problems with this take, as it looks like is not concatenating them properly

[01:24:10] <fakuve> (well actually was 180 degree rotation)
[01:25:02] <fakuve> Then I have tried unsuccesfully 2 methods to concatante the videos
[01:25:25] <fakuve> Either `    ffmpeg -f concat -safe 0 -i mylist.txt -c copy output.mp4` (it had issues rendering the rotated video)

[01:27:51] <aphysically> I wonder if the code for dash can be modified to accept a rational somehow for segment length
[01:28:59] *** Joins: hseg (~hseg@IGLD-84-228-238-75.inter.net.il)
[01:29:11] <aphysically> because the segment length needs to be specified exactly to avoid the stream breaking when not using a timeline, the usage of a truncated decimal means some framerates don't work without a timeline with ffmpeg's dash muxer
[01:29:32] <aphysically> I suspect most people would just say "use the timeline" though, which is what I'm doing
[01:29:33] <hseg> Hi. Have crackling noise in the background, any way to reduce it?
[01:29:48] <hseg> highpass/lowpass makes voices harder to hear
[01:30:00] <hseg> and the dedicated noise filters don't seem to be removing it much
[01:31:48] <aphysically> take a 23.976 framerate for example (NOT 24000/1001), because the reduced fraction numerator is 2997 which has no factors in common with 2/5, the minimal segment length that works without timelines in ffmpeg's dash muxer is 2997/23.976)=125 seconds
[01:32:00] <aphysically> which isn't reasonable for streaming
[01:33:57] <Hello71> sounds like #ffmpeg-devel
[01:36:49] <aphysically> looking into the dash spec the duration is stored in microseconds, so a rational won't help and it's a problem with the dash spec
[01:37:11] <aphysically> ("problem" in that it just can't handle certain framerates with its timelines without an extremely large segment length)
[01:37:41] <aphysically> without using its timelines I mean
[01:38:56] <aphysically> unless the duration field can accept fractional numbers
[01:39:26] <aphysically> not sure I want to dig that much into the dash spec to find out, but it seems unlikely it would support both microseconds and fractions
[01:40:57] <aphysically> at least it's easy enough to code to detect if the framerate can't be compatible
[01:41:07] <aphysically> (with timeline-free dash)
[01:44:44] <aphysically> (if the numerator of the framerate after removing all factors of 2/5 is significantly higher than your desired GOP frame count)

[18:24:58] <gpeskens_> Question, can FFMPEG do partial decoding of h264 streams with intra-refresh enabled, meaning that it would start outputting (artifacted) frames immediately until it has had a full refresh?
[18:32:05] <JEEB> not sure, that fights against the general logic of the decoder, although it might be under some option
[18:32:15] <JEEB> since it is just "start up time" and not actual latency that's affected
