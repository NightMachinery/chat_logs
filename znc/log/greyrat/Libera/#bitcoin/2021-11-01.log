[07:51:43] <mexijoe> hello world 🌎
[07:51:58] <linuxmint> Hello, I need help securing my sats.
[07:52:22] <mexijoe> shaf is that
[07:52:28] <mexijoe> what are u saying
[07:56:01] <linuxmint> I have a little BTC for spending via metamask and retirement savings where the key is moved off the exchange.
[07:56:26] <linuxmint> I physically have 2 metal bolts with 24 washers with the seedphrase in 2 locations.
[07:56:44] <linuxmint> My concern is the seedphrase may be stolen.  How do I secure the seedphrase from theft?
[07:57:42] <linuxmint> I have read https://www.lopp.net/bitcoin-information.html and https://www.lopp.net/bitcoin-information/security.html
[07:57:51] <mexijoe> u can't
[07:58:14] <linuxmint> mexijoe: of course there's a way, I'm just unclear.
[07:58:28] <linuxmint> E.g. encrypt the seedphrase, but that's just my idea.
[07:58:31] <mexijoe> reset it
[07:59:02] <mexijoe> u don't use coinbase?
[07:59:12] <linuxmint> mexijoe: but the time between the seedphrase theft and reset, a thief could wipe my savings.
[07:59:38] <linuxmint> I used coinbase, but I need to move my funds of exchanges. Not your keys, not your funds.
[07:59:42] <mexijoe> that's why u need 2 step verification.
[08:00:03] <linuxmint> I have some small savings on an exchange for interest earned, but have decided the capital gain is greater than the interest earned.
[08:00:15] <mexijoe> ok
[08:00:26] <mexijoe> u got one bitcoin?
[08:00:32] <linuxmint> mexijoe: 2FA doesn't save your stolen exchange keys.
[08:00:51] <linuxmint> I can't discuss personal wealth, it's against the security best practice.
[08:01:08] <linuxmint> ...or lack thereof.
[08:01:20] <mexijoe> I'm trying to make 1 bitcoin
[08:02:30] <linuxmint> mexijoe: sure, minimum wage for 1-2 years will earn you that.
[08:03:03] <mexijoe> or 10 months android devel I er
[08:03:15] <linuxmint> even better
[08:03:47] <linuxmint> I'll come back when more can help with the basic security of non-custodial keys.
[08:04:21] <mexijoe> I never used a key
[08:04:29] <mexijoe> just coinbase
[08:04:40] <linuxmint> Me too, but I need to learn now how to move funds to my custody.
[08:05:18] <linuxmint> I don't understand how to protect your passphrase for a hot wallet or seedphrase stored on a metal bolt with washers.
[08:05:50] <linuxmint> I think I need a hot wallet to withdraw my keys to my physical metal bolt/washer storage?
[08:06:09] <linuxmint> Lots of material to read, but no easy infographics.
[08:07:01] <linuxmint> Coinbase is good, I had sats there since ~2010.  I find early IT companies lose your old passwords and data, but Coinbase was good to me.
[08:07:58] <mexijoe> u mean a cold storage wallet

[08:08:52] <linuxmint> mexijoe: no, I think a cold wallet will break with time due to electronics.  I'm looking for the best storage, which I've concluded is a physical metal bolt with 12-24 washers stamped with the seedphrase.
[08:09:14] <linuxmint> 2 physical metal tubular storages in 2 separate locations.
[08:09:32] <linuxmint> I just need to solve if someone steals a seedphrase.
[08:09:35] <mexijoe> what if u die
[08:09:50] <linuxmint> A Will shows instructions on how to recover.
[08:10:02] <mexijoe> 👍
[08:10:14] <mexijoe> true
[08:10:24] <linuxmint> To avoid theft, I could encrypt the seed phrase, but thinking...perhaps store the decryption process on the cloud somewhere?
[08:11:09] <mexijoe> u must be rich
[08:11:18] <linuxmint> This needs to work whether I'm a 1st world technically capable person or a 3rd world person living in a mud village.
[08:11:38] <linuxmint> No, but planning for serious moving to blockchain.
[08:11:48] <linuxmint> Just dabbling for now to test blockchain.
[08:12:06] <linuxmint> If the security can be solved, I can move more serious to the future world, potentially blockchain.
[08:12:45] <mexijoe> The Gold Titanium CORAZON
[08:13:00] <linuxmint> I wonder how El Salvador is training locals with no IT literacy how to store their money?
[08:13:08] <linuxmint> So easy to lose a password.
[08:13:27] <mexijoe> 2000 bucks for a gold crypto wallet
[08:13:29] <linuxmint> mexijoe: I have no idea what you just typed?
[08:13:33] <linuxmint> lol
[08:13:51] <linuxmint> That won't help the world from 1st to 3rd world mud huts.
[08:14:17] <mexijoe> corazon makes wallets
[08:14:28] <linuxmint> Hot or cold?
[08:15:04] <mexijoe> CORAZON® STEALTH TITANIUM CRYPTO HARDWARE WALLET
[08:15:04] <mexijoe> $1,499.00 USD
[08:15:05] <linuxmint> I don't think I need a wallet.  I have a hot wallet to buy sats via an exchange.  The trick is to move the keys to your custody.
[08:15:24] <linuxmint> mexijoe: that's out of reach of mainstream users.
[08:15:37] <linuxmint> *for
[08:16:12] <linuxmint> Needs to be as cheap as possible.
[08:17:01] <linuxmint> Imagine you live in a mud hat and a crazed dictator destroys your home.  How can you prove you owned the title?  Recover blockchain from your buried metal bolt and washers.
[08:17:27] <linuxmint> ...but the metal bolt and washers can also be stolen, so this needs protection and I'm unclear how.
[08:17:51] <linuxmint> Actually, I'm now confused on moving the keys from the exchange to me?
[08:18:11] <linuxmint> Unsure if I'll have keys, passphrase and seedphrase on me?
[08:18:51] <mexijoe> I just use my last name
[08:18:55] <linuxmint> ...the Will would need some type of multisig to stop a lawyer stealing the funds.
[08:19:15] <mexijoe> I got 20 bucks in bitcoin
[08:19:23] <linuxmint> RICH!
[08:19:37] <linuxmint> What do you mean re last name?
[08:19:53] <linuxmint> I think I need to practice moving $1 off the exchange to my custody.
[08:19:59] <mexijoe> I never got  a key
[08:20:17] <linuxmint> From memory, this changed the passphrase or seedphrase, so I need to diagram the whole process.
[08:20:37] <mexijoe> what site u go thru
[08:20:43] <linuxmint> Yes, I never had a key from CoinBase, as they're a Custodial Exchange.
[08:20:51] <mexijoe> metamqsk?
[08:21:07] <linuxmint> Coinbase funds need to be moved to a non-custodial exchange, who let you take your keys.
[08:21:30] <mexijoe> bitcoin.com ?
[08:21:33] <linuxmint> I use Metamask just a little bit for quick purchases, like a hot wallet with $100 on it.
[08:22:13] <mexijoe> why use metamask if u use coinbase
[08:22:15] <linuxmint> You might not believe this, but I have about 50 accounts.  I've been testing them all.
[08:22:20] <linuxmint> Unsure what's best yet.
[08:22:40] <linuxmint> Metamask is easy for online computer transactions.
[08:22:59] <mexijoe> I use coinbase to fund poker site it has no fee
[08:23:12] <mexijoe> if u use litecoin
[08:23:15] <linuxmint> Yes, I shop around for the lowest fees too.
[08:23:21] <linuxmint> Makes a difference.
[08:23:39] <linuxmint> But now I have decided I need to control my keys if I'm going to be serious.

[08:24:44] <linuxmint> I tend to go back to Binance the most...seems user friendliest, easiest, cheapest and fastest.
[08:25:05] <mexijoe> binance
[08:25:30] <linuxmint> Well, there's 2 ways to earn money...no fees, earn interest or capital growth.
[08:26:16] <mexijoe> does biancr have litecoin
[08:26:34] <linuxmint> not sure
[08:26:47] <linuxmint> look at this list I made https://dpaste.com/57U6LSJ62
[08:26:55] <mexijoe> and this device will handle all networks
[08:27:06] <linuxmint> seems pretty flexible.
[08:28:01] <mexijoe> what was that list
[08:28:25] <linuxmint> If you're saving, the best process to make your money work for you.
[08:28:56] <linuxmint> I'm not a financial adviser and DYOR, but this is my conclusion so far.
[08:29:57] <mexijoe> so save 140,000 in bitcoin and u will get 420,000?
[08:30:25] <linuxmint> how did you reach that conclusion?
[08:31:08] <linuxmint> ...that's $8.4B.
[08:31:33] <mexijoe> 162,000
[08:31:39] <mexijoe> 152,000 top line
[08:31:43] <mexijoe> in bitcoin
[08:31:54] <mexijoe> that is 3 bitcoins
[08:32:09] <linuxmint> $76,000 in BTC would 2-10x.
[08:32:24] <linuxmint> So, start with $76,000.
[08:32:30] <linuxmint> or $1.
[08:32:50] <linuxmint> @ 2-10x per annum.
[08:33:18] <linuxmint> you should be able to see the difference from the top to the bottom performers where you put your savings.
[08:33:27] <mexijoe> I make 200 a day delivering driver
[08:33:39] <mexijoe> I can save 150 a day
[08:33:45] <linuxmint> sweet, work it all in my list, it makes a difference.
[08:34:02] <linuxmint> Most put in in a bank, I moved to neobanks.
[08:34:20] <linuxmint> moving to crypto once I finalise the security of my seedphrase.
[08:34:49] <linuxmint> at the moment, anyone could photograph my seedphrase, so this needs improving.
[08:35:05] <mexijoe> I just put it in wells Fargo and coij
[08:35:10] <mexijoe> coinbase
[08:35:31] <linuxmint> I could place the metal bolt with 12-24 stamped washers in a tamper proof bag and bury it, but the seedphrase can still be stolen.
[08:35:34] <mexijoe> your saying to put it all in on crypto
[08:35:55] <mexijoe> use it ij your head
[08:36:08] <mexijoe> store it in your brain 🧠
[08:36:10] <linuxmint> mexijoe: the numbers show crypto is the greatest return.  Any spending cash either in crypto or fiat in a neobank.
[08:36:27] <linuxmint> No, memory is unreliable and vulnerable to a $5 wrench attack.
[08:36:45] <mexijoe> tire iron
[08:36:57] <linuxmint> I am thinking to encrypt the seedphrase, then store the decryption process on the cloud somewhere, but not 100% sure?
[08:37:07] <linuxmint> what's a tire iron?
[08:37:36] <mexijoe> crypt it with a crypto like atomic crypto

[08:39:43] <linuxmint> mexijoe: lol, sure, yeah.  The common crypto phrase is $5 wrench attack.
[08:41:22] <linuxmint> mexijoe: if you're referring to the atomicwallet.io, this is vulnerable as it's a hot wallet.  I could not use this to encrypt my seedphrase at it's online.
[08:42:28] <linuxmint> I think the seedphrase, obtained from a hot wallet, needs to be encrypted with a separate program.  This encryption I hope will be 12-24 words, so this can be stamped on the bolt with 12-24 10mm washers.
[08:43:25] <linuxmint> Unless there's a better way to protect the physical seedphrase?
[08:43:50] <linuxmint> I don't fully understand using multisig, but could be a competitor pending security and usability.
[08:44:09] <mexijoe> u need a blacksmith
[08:44:43] <linuxmint> mexijoe: no, this easy for anyone to buy a $15 metal stampkit, 1 bolt, 1 nut and 12-24 10mm washers.
[08:45:12] <mexijoe> the bury it in a back lyard
[08:45:45] <linuxmint> mexijoe: I think so.  Not sure how deep to avoid metal detectors, but probably safe enough compared to hiding in the home coffee jar.
[08:46:27] <mexijoe> my metal detectors goes 8 inches deep
[08:47:00] <mexijoe> garret at max
[08:47:03] <linuxmint> >20cm hole is reasonable I think.
[08:48:39] <linuxmint> Professional equipment can reach atleast 2 metres, but I still think buried is the most reasonable.
