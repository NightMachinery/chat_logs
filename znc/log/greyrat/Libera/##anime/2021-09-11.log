She wakes up, freaks out, and slaps MC in the face. MC tries to explain that it's really just masturbation, when he suddenly has a moment of clarity and realizes that he wouldn't want to make out with a male version of himself, so obviously she wouldn't want to make out with him. MC 
[03:50:51] <Nanobot> apologizes and asks if she can at least fondle herself while he watches. She slaps him again. MC is now very confused. She puts her clothes on and ties her hair up. That's when MC notices that she's his sister.

[05:17:38] <kiboneu> what class
[05:17:39] <analoq> i had that too :<
[05:17:48] <blue_rog> it's german class
[05:18:06] <analoq> boggles my mind why anyone would want to learn german :D
[05:18:09] <blue_rog> i'm learning to move to Austria early next year
[05:18:13] <analoq> ah
[05:18:21] <blue_rog> going to be studying there
[05:18:24] <analoq> yeah austria is definitely the better germany :p
[05:18:31] <blue_rog> XD i've heard
[05:18:35] <blue_rog> in terms of beauty
[05:18:52] <kiboneu> i like the techno raves
[05:19:03] <blue_rog> it's a hard language to speak, especially from asia
[05:19:09] <analoq> not much raving going on with corona im afraid
[05:19:20] <analoq> yeah lots of odd sounds :D
[05:19:25] <blue_rog> not too many languages (that i can think of) use the back of the throat so much
[05:19:48] <blue_rog> took me a few days to just get the 'ch' properly pronounced
[05:19:54] <kiboneu> im taking japanese rn
[05:19:55] <analoq> i think russian is more complex though
[05:20:01] <amigojapan> analoq: I have a friend who went to live in Germany because of the free schooling
[05:20:06] <kiboneu> i know russian
[05:20:08] <analoq> yeah makes sense
[05:20:18] <analoq> but make sure to gtfo after
[05:20:29] <analoq> because then they tax you to death :D
[05:20:35] <blue_rog> yeah, the price of education is incredibly cheap!
[05:20:47] <blue_rog> i was super stunned comparing when i compared it to the US
[05:21:01] <blue_rog> like
[05:21:07] <analoq> there pretty much is no cost at all (at least for europeans)
[05:21:17] <blue_rog> two months of rent for me = 1 sem of tuition fees
[05:21:21] <blue_rog> and that blows my mind
[05:21:40] <analoq> you pay like 200bucks per semester, but most of that is for the public transport ticket
[05:21:46] <amigojapan> analoq: there is minimum cost even if you are not European

[05:22:17] <analoq> not/non*
[05:22:26] <blue_rog> my tuition will be around 800 euro / sem and rent will be close to 500 euro / month
[05:22:44] <blue_rog> analoq: i'm pretty sure you're correct. everywhere i check it, that seems to be the case
[05:23:02] <amigojapan> analoq: my Japanese friends went there to study
[05:23:07] <analoq> which is fair imho 800 is still dirt cheap :D
[05:23:25] <analoq> granted we dont have fancy universities like harvard, but in the end you learn the same
[05:23:33] <blue_rog> amigojapan: they went to Germany?

[05:23:54] *** Joins: swagneko (~bit@user/nekobit)
[05:24:11] <blue_rog> analoq: i think the universities are perfectly fine. it's only in america where the uni you studied at matters so incredibly high.
[05:24:48] <amigojapan> blue_rog: mine coated like 37kusd per year
[05:24:49] <analoq> blue_rog: im pretty sure we value it here as well. I would always invite someone who went to harvard or a similar university
[05:25:20] <blue_rog> wow, amigojapan that's relatively cheap-ish compared to other values i hear. how long ago was this?
[05:25:26] <amigojapan> I went to New England institute of technology
[05:25:57] <analoq> it's not that i would assume that person learned there more, but it takes some drive/skill/connections to get in
[05:25:57] <amigojapan> blue_rog: late 90s to 2001
[05:26:09] <blue_rog> analoq: i guess, but i've seen many amazing research come out of universities that are not 'par' with harvard
[05:26:35] <blue_rog> amigojapan: ah okay, i think that's still expensive for even back then. but i am not too sure though.
[05:27:18] <ButterNoodle> bad news everyone
[05:27:18] <amigojapan> blue_rog: my grandparents paid for it
[05:27:25] <analoq> blue_rog: we have some universities that are a little above the others. e.g. rwth achen
[05:27:32] <amigojapan> What's wrong ButterNoodle ?
[05:27:34] <ButterNoodle> if a new ATF director isn't appointed in the next 23 days, rule 34 of article 2 clause 7 of the US constitution states that the speaker of the house may appoint nominees to any vacant positions. Google "Speaker Pelosi rule 34" to find out how you can help fight the liberal takeover of the ATF.

[05:48:50] <analoq> and often you have 100km/h limits when it's raining

[17:20:37] <amigojapan> SlowTypist: ok yeah. Sounds popular, but largely popular animes tend to be bad

[19:39:15] <SpiritOfSummer> darkwitch: try it
[19:39:25] <SpiritOfSummer> I think nowadays the best thing to watch is dragon ball z kai
[19:39:27] <amigojapan> Guest77: it's the story that dragon Ball was based on
[19:39:28] <darkwitch> over my dead and buried body
[19:39:38] <SpiritOfSummer> darkwitch: why
[19:39:47] <saganman> I have watched all dragon ball anime
[19:39:47] <SpiritOfSummer> dragon ball z kai skips filler
[19:39:52] <SpiritOfSummer> saganman: nice
[19:39:55] <saganman> every dragon ball anime!
[19:40:01] <SpiritOfSummer> movies too?
[19:40:03] <darkwitch> from clips it looks like all childish fighting
[19:40:05] <saganman> yup
[19:40:12] <amigojapan> SpiritOfSummer: darkwitch does not like fighting
[19:40:23] <Guest96> R U A 
[19:40:30] <SpiritOfSummer> that would certainly turn somebody away from it
[19:40:31] <saganman> it was my first love in anime back when I didn't even know what anime is

[19:40:42] <SpiritOfSummer> but I own the last 3 seasons
[19:40:51] <SpiritOfSummer> tien, piccolo and jr arcs 
[19:41:10] <Guest77> yeah, i haven't seen the original dragon ball with kid goku.
[19:41:16] <SpiritOfSummer> because I've seen some of the beginning of it and it's not for me
[19:41:19] <Guest77> it's too comedic
[19:41:23] <SpiritOfSummer> but I want to see the tournament with tien

[19:41:30] *** Joins: Finn (~Finn@204.113.154.13)
[19:41:32] <SpiritOfSummer> and the piccolo arcs are teen goku, so it should feel a tad liek dragon ball z
[19:41:37] *** Finn is now known as Fin
[19:41:48] <saganman> the early dragon ball was nice and also quite light
[19:41:58] <SpiritOfSummer> yeah the beginning of dragon ball doesn't have any of what I like dragon ball for
[19:42:04] <darkwitch> they should all make up and stop fighting
[19:42:07] <saganman> the later dragon ball breaks your heart
[19:42:10] <saganman> at times
[19:42:15] <SpiritOfSummer> darkwitch: it's the douchebag villains fault
[19:42:28] <darkwitch> it is never that SpiritOfSummer
[19:42:39] <SpiritOfSummer> not to mention goku and vegeta are morons and always let the villain get to their strongest form because it will be more excited
[19:42:47] <SpiritOfSummer> darkwitch: then what is it
[19:42:48] <darkwitch> it is always the writer of the story that is to blame
[19:42:54] <SpiritOfSummer> eh 
[19:43:09] <SpiritOfSummer> yeah I guess you're right
[19:43:11] <darkwitch> lack of enlightenment
[19:43:19] <SpiritOfSummer> but that's like blaming lamps in video games for using real electricity
[19:43:23] <SpiritOfSummer> I mean they are
[19:43:34] <SpiritOfSummer> but so's the rest of the game so what does it matter
[19:43:54] <SpiritOfSummer> darkwitch: it is not a lack of enlightenment
[19:44:04] <SpiritOfSummer> saganman: what is your favorite series
[19:44:12] <amigojapan> SpiritOfSummer: if the writer is bad. Then I don't want to watch it
[19:44:12] <darkwitch> the person has not learned to forgive
[19:44:34] <darkwitch> the only response can be retaliation
[19:44:38] <SpiritOfSummer> amigojapan: the writer of dragon ball has the most trash memory in the world
[19:45:13] <SpiritOfSummer> darkwitch: the writer of the show shall not be framed for the actions of the evil characters within the show my friend
[19:45:40] <SpiritOfSummer> because I know that you know that I know that you know that I know that you know that it was made for entertainment
[19:45:42] <darkwitch> SpiritOfSummer, the writer created the characters and all their actions
[19:45:46] <amigojapan> SpiritOfSummer: there is nothing really new after a point in dragon Ball it's all just get more powerful escalation and fight
[19:45:55] <amigojapan> SpiritOfSummer: that's boring
[19:46:02] <SpiritOfSummer> amigojapan: but it is when you have a certain character that you like to see in action
[19:46:17] <SpiritOfSummer> it's exciting to see how each person moves forward in power not to mention their personality does show actual growth
[19:46:50] <SpiritOfSummer> goku is a farmer now and actually makes money
[19:47:05] <SpiritOfSummer> vegeta is literally a beast of a dad and husband
[19:47:30] <SpiritOfSummer> and has a daughter now
[19:47:40] <beaky> nice i like daughters
[19:47:55] <SpiritOfSummer> amigojapan: and ultra instinct, goku's newest form, is astoundingly interesting to see
[19:48:11] <SpiritOfSummer> especially when the angel Whis goes into passionate description about what's happening with it.
[19:48:21] <saganman> SpiritOfSummer: can't pick one but ghost in the shell stand alone complex, cowboy bebop, full metal alchemist brotherhood, gintama, genshiken would be my favorites 
[19:48:28] <amigojapan> SpiritOfSummer: I liked his other manga better are chan
[19:48:30] <Guest77> Do you keep up with the manga?
[19:48:30] <SpiritOfSummer> and how the other Gods who haven't even acheived it yet get jealous 
[19:48:44] <SpiritOfSummer> Guest77: I want to
[19:48:49] <Guest77> yeah, it's good
[19:48:52] <SpiritOfSummer> I'm gonna start with the zamasu arc 
[19:48:57] <SpiritOfSummer> and go from there
[19:49:12] <SpiritOfSummer> because I want to see how that arc actually happened and not how the anime mutilated it for tvs sake
[19:49:38] <amigojapan> SpiritOfSummer: you better also learn Japanese
[19:49:51] <SpiritOfSummer> nah I know sites that do fan translations 
[19:50:15] <SpiritOfSummer> amigojapan: I don't even watch subs
[19:50:16] <saganman> oh, you mean dragon ball series SpiritOfSummer? Boo saga is my fav
[19:50:21] <SpiritOfSummer> yeah 
[19:50:27] <amigojapan> SpiritOfSummer: you know vegetas "it's over 9000"is actually 8000?

[19:51:26] <SpiritOfSummer> amigojapan: the funny thing about that is, everybody always has Chris Sabat say that line in public, the main English voice actor for vegeta, but the dub that line got famous from was not him, it was from a different english dub
[19:51:38] <amigojapan> Sxem: remember when people were saying "it's not worse than the flu"?
[19:52:02] <SpiritOfSummer> and the cool thing is there was a bullshit filler arc in dragon ball super where there was an evil clone of vegeta, and they actually got the voice actor from that other older dub to do the clone vegetas voice
[19:52:07] <SpiritOfSummer> that was a cool cameo
[19:52:40] <DaPinkOne> Sxem, maybe we'll declare a "war on pandemics"?
[19:53:10] <Guest77> SpiritOfSummer what arc was this called?
[19:53:18] <SpiritOfSummer> don't watch it
[19:53:26] <SpiritOfSummer> it was created to treat vegeta like trash
[19:53:35] <SpiritOfSummer> he loses his power and they degrade him
[19:53:41] <SpiritOfSummer> non canon

[19:55:18] <SpiritOfSummer> Guest77: yeah but not the manga
[19:55:19] <DaPinkOne> Guest77, if it's "filler", then it's anime-original, not part of the manga source material
[19:55:33] <amigojapan> DaPinkOne: the US does not really want to take on China on war, that would be a big one
[19:55:34] <DaPinkOne> the anime team made it up to fill time

[19:56:40] <SpiritOfSummer> but I'm happy they got their head out of their ass for dragon ball super broly and gave vegeta some good ass whooping screen time

[19:59:32] <amigojapan> Nuclear powers don't have wars with nuclear powers. It's the unwritten rule
[20:00:45] <SpiritOfSummer> Guest77: the one thing that I'm waiting for to happen
[20:00:50] <SpiritOfSummer> is for vegeta to take out a main villain
[20:01:05] <SpiritOfSummer> he already had a huge win in the tourmanent of power, but it's time for them to give him the big one
[20:01:11] <Guest77> vegeta should have killed Freiza in Ressurection F
[20:01:12] <SpiritOfSummer> they given main villain kills to 3 people now
[20:01:15] <SpiritOfSummer> trunks, goku and gohan
[20:01:22] <SpiritOfSummer> Guest77: yes for sure
[20:01:26] <SpiritOfSummer> that was horrendous writing

[20:04:04] <DaPinkOne> DB Super is still following vegeta and goku I think. I could see a sequel following the kids or something. At some point goku and friends are just gonna be masters of the universe with no competition

[20:11:25] <DaPinkOne> ah, that makes sense
[20:11:42] <SpiritOfSummer> you could say it's bardock because he's the father of goku who was the saiyan who went on to rediscover it
[20:11:44] <Guest77> there are three candidates: goku, broly, and bardock
[20:11:45] <Vohveli> the Bardock special kinda implies he was the legendary SSJ from the past but... :P

[20:12:00] <SpiritOfSummer> and I've never really heard it described well who's supposed to be the main legendary one
[20:12:20] <SpiritOfSummer> honestly I would just say it's vegeta, he's reached the highest level of power in all super saiyan forms
[20:12:39] <SpiritOfSummer> Beerus said that SS2 vegeta is stronger than SS3 goku, and he took super saiyan blue to a higher level than goku did

[20:17:48] <darkwitch> they never consider why they want to be stronger
[20:18:26] <DaPinkOne> darkwitch, goku clearly does consider why he wants to be stronger at several points throughout the series
[20:18:36] *** Joins: Cashlin (~hp@user/cashlin)
[20:18:57] <amigojapan> When kamesennin destroyed the moon. They reached the limit of power. Now they are just making stuff up
[20:19:13] <SpiritOfSummer> amigojapan: no
[20:19:16] <darkwitch> no DaPinkOne, I mean, the people who are seriously interested in watching these shows, they don't give that any thought
[20:19:28] <SpiritOfSummer> ultra instinct exists as otherwise
[20:20:22] <DaPinkOne> darkwitch, rephrase? Do you mean the fans of the show don't consider the motives of the characters?
[20:20:30] <saganman> back
[20:20:32] <amigojapan> SpiritOfSummer: I also don't want to look at buff men. It's gay
[20:20:43] <beaky> lol
[20:20:45] <darkwitch> the idea is to be stronger so they can beat that other guy? because that other guy is deliberately designed to be the antagonist?
[20:20:49] <saganman> SpiritOfSummer: you known ultra instinct is very budhist
[20:20:59] <DaPinkOne> amigojapan, admiring physique isn't necessarily gay
[20:21:00] <saganman> SpiritOfSummer: it kind of exists in real life
[20:21:06] <saganman> in zen budhism
[20:21:07] <SpiritOfSummer> amigojapan: lol that's the best reasoning not to watch dragon ball I've heard yet
[20:21:25] <SpiritOfSummer> by that I mean if somebody was not gay and did not want to see gay things
[20:21:27] <Guest77> darkwitch Everyone wants to be better than the other. Even in the real world
[20:21:28] <amigojapan> Thanks SpiritOfSummer 
[20:21:29] <darkwitch> how about being the weakest instead, so you can get killed
[20:21:39] <SpiritOfSummer> rephrasing to fix having sounded homophobic for a second
[20:21:42] <Guest77> darkwitch Do you want to be homeless?
[20:21:56] <Guest77> No, some people want to accumulate wealth and some want a lot of it.
[20:22:10] <SpiritOfSummer> saganman: I wouldn't doubt it
[20:22:13] <SpiritOfSummer> how do you acheive it
[20:22:21] <darkwitch> after enough repeats of killing people, one might hope the "bad guy" learns that killing is a bad idea
[20:22:23] <saganman> I don't think everyone wants to be like that. Sure people like to improve themselves trying to be better than others is just sad
[20:22:38] <Guest77> I mean - that's called being competitive
[20:22:40] <Guest77> which is normal
[20:22:51] <amigojapan> Guest77: I am sure there have been people that have wanted to become homeless
[20:22:58] <darkwitch> competition is bad
[20:23:07] <Guest77> But in the Broly movie -- Whis asked Vegeta and Goku why they keep training
[20:23:11] <DaPinkOne> darkwitch, that does happen a few times throughout the series. The bad guy becoming one of the good guys is a common trope

[20:23:31] <saganman> SpiritOfSummer: It is true. There's zen way of swordsmanship and archery. One achieves by completely detaching themselves from everything in universe. It is notorious task.
[20:23:55] <beaky> yes becoming best friends after beating up the bad guy is one of the cornerstones of shonen
[20:23:57] <DaPinkOne> darkwitch, competition isn't bad. competition is fine.
[20:24:07] <amigojapan> Guest77: there are difficulties of being homeless. But a lot of responsibility must be lifted when you become homeless

[20:24:45] <saganman> Bco1981 is streaming!!
[20:24:52] <DaPinkOne> Guest77, I gotta give goku props. He somehow ammassed a posse, in a shounen show, with minimal use of "power of friendship"
[20:24:54] <amigojapan> darkwitch: spots are bad
[20:25:14] <amigojapan> darkwitch: sports
[20:25:25] <darkwitch> sport is mostly bad because of the supporters who don't do sports
[20:25:42] <beaky> is the tokyo olympics over
[20:25:43] <darkwitch> of course the actual competition plays a large part
[20:25:48] <saganman> SpiritOfSummer: read this book, you will understand, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen_in_the_Art_of_Archery
[20:25:48] <ImoutoBot> [title] Zen in the Art of Archery - Wikipedia
[20:25:49] <DaPinkOne> darkwitch, "is bad" isn't really descriptive. What is bad?
[20:26:01] <amigojapan> It is, finally! beaky 
[20:26:03] <DaPinkOne> why do you dislike these things?
[20:26:06] <darkwitch> bad is whatever each individual says is bad
[20:26:09] <Guest77> darkwitch competition is good. you should want to be one of the best
[20:26:13] <darkwitch> the same applies to good
[20:26:14] <beaky> what will hapen now that the olympics is no more
[20:26:24] <darkwitch> there is no inherent good or bad
[20:26:44] <DaPinkOne> darkwitch, you're dodging the question.
[20:26:56] <darkwitch> Guest77, being the best means someone else must be the worst
[20:27:02] <darkwitch> that is not good
[20:27:14] <Guest77> Are you a communist?
[20:27:20] <saganman> the thing about Zen is, those who know zen can't talk about it
[20:27:27] <beaky> you need to be the best to win the girl in tokimeki memorial
[20:27:36] <DaPinkOne> darkwitch, that's only problematic if resources are distributed based on this competition. 
[20:27:53] <amigojapan> darkwitch: they have not heard the lyrics of the song "sekai ni hitotsu dake no hana"which explains why comparing ourselves to others and trying to be better than others is bad
[20:28:11] <DaPinkOne> there's nothing wrong with being the worst in a competition. Everybody who's the best started out at a lower level
[20:28:19] <saganman> !addquote beaky darkwitch: being the best means someone else must be the worst, that is not good. beaky: you need to be the best to win the girl in tokimeki memorial

[20:29:07] <saganman> In today's world, everyone is a winner, isn't it? I don't see kids getting, "you have lost Bobby*" talk
[20:29:07] <darkwitch> you may continue talking about your glorious dragon ball now
[20:29:19] * darkwitch fades into nothingness
[20:29:54] <Guest77> darkwitch best be careful. you're talking about one of the best animes of all time
[20:29:55] <amigojapan> darkwitch: no! Don't leave me alone with this bunch
[20:32:25] <amigojapan> Guest77: it may have been good in the past, but they have dragged it out for too long
[20:32:28] <Guest77> "I want to be the very best like no one ever was"
[20:32:36] <Guest77> even pokemon has this philosophy
[20:32:45] <Guest77> Bill Gates wanted to be one of the best in software
[20:32:47] <Guest77> ect
[20:33:08] <Guest77> Elon Musk wants to be the best in eletric vehicles. The list goes on
[20:33:10] <DaPinkOne> i'm pretty sure bill gates just wanted to form a monopoly and make bank
[20:33:18] <amigojapan> Guest77: Microsoft is over of the worst software companies
[20:33:37] <Guest77> back in the 90s-ish they were good
[20:33:43] <amigojapan> One of the worst
[20:33:48] <Guest77> monopoly is good in economics
[20:33:51] <Guest77> it means big bucks
[20:33:58] <DaPinkOne> Guest77, extend, embrace, extinguish?
[20:34:36] <DaPinkOne> it means big bucks, but it doesn't mean the best software
[20:34:38] <amigojapan> Monopoly eliminates competition. You said competition is good

[22:05:12] <Guest1097> That should speak for itself man
[22:05:17] <emmeka> Guest1097 long before Super was a thing, when the English release of Dragon Ball GT was still pretty new, I sat down and watched all of Dragon Ball start to finish over the course of a few months.
[22:05:39] <emmeka> and you know what I came out of it thinking
[22:05:41] <emmeka> it's ok.
[22:05:41] <Guest1097> GT is well known to be not good - it isn't canon 
[22:05:48] <emmeka> I know GT isn't good or canon.
[22:06:16] <Guest1097> Have you seen any DBS?
[22:06:26] <emmeka> no. and I'm probably not going to.
[22:06:47] <Guest1097> You can watch DBS Broly with your DBZ knowledge
[22:06:51] <Guest1097> You would enjoy it
[22:06:55] <emmeka> Guest1097 the reason is simple, I am bored of DBZ. It offers nothing I want in an anime now. 
[22:07:13] <emmeka> I do not doubt your claim that, for what it is, DBS Broly is a great anime movie.
[22:07:15] <darkwitch> a very good reason
[22:07:26] <Guest1097> i disagree
[22:07:38] <darkwitch> it's a great movie for someone else which is not me
[22:07:47] <emmeka> right, darkwitch
[22:07:51] <Guest1097> you don't need to watch DBS but the movie at least
[22:07:56] <saganman> dragon ball has always been evolving
[22:07:58] <Guest1097> it's only like an hour and 20 minutes
[22:08:00] <Sxem> have you tried being someone else, someone who likes that movie?
[22:08:07] <saganman> it's not just powering up now
[22:08:39] <Sxem> i havent seen much dragonball. the target market seems to be the low end of shounen, the youngest of the young
[22:08:50] <saganman> even back in cell saga, it was different
[22:08:56] <Guest1097> i would like to say there are ZERO sailor moon movies in the top 100 grossing anime films
[22:08:59] <emmeka> Sxem some of Dragon Ball is objectively the best of shounen, tbf
[22:09:06] <saganman> the latest dbs is very different from the norm
[22:09:11] <Sxem> i think ive seen a couple db movies
[22:09:29] <emmeka> Guest1097 that's not very surprising considering all Sailor Moon films aired over 25 years ago
[22:09:39] <saganman> Bulla was just too cute in the new Broly movie
[22:09:45] <Sxem> there were only 4 billion humans just 50 years ago
[22:09:49] <Sxem> now theres 8 billion
[22:10:23] <Guest1097> the soundtrack to Broly is also very good 
[22:10:35] <darkwitch> most of those billions never watched the broly movie
[22:10:44] <darkwitch> and they never will
[22:10:47] <Guest1097> yeah and it's their loss
[22:11:06] <Guest1097> it's the 13th highest grossing anime film and the highest grossing in 2018
[22:11:11] <saganman> and the Broly fight, god that animation
[22:11:17] <saganman> it was something else
[22:11:21] <Guest1097> very true
[22:11:40] <Guest1097> * 13 grossing of all time
[22:11:47] <emmeka> Guest1097 look, I'm not shit talking your taste. I believe your claim that it is probably a great movie. but I'm not really into action shounens anymore, and I've had enough Dragon Ball infused into my brain over this lifetime to never need more

[22:13:42] <Guest1097> yes, he used the dragon balls to do such
[22:13:51] * darkwitch fades into nothingness
[22:14:12] <saganman> and also what's the deal with the angel that's training Goku? Apparently Whis is angry with him as I read

[23:05:37] <saganman> there are quite a lot of good shounen anime and manga
[23:05:58] <saganman> you are lucky as you are new to anime
[23:06:33] <emmeka> yeah. I too thought shows like DBZ were the best thing ever when I first watched them. but now, if I do watch shounen, I'm very choosy with it
[23:07:01] <emmeka> only recent thing I've been particularly impressed with has been Demon Slayer, and that's mostly for that great Ufotable animation
[23:08:03] <saganman> yup, most modern shounen anime haven't been able to impress me at all
[23:08:28] <saganman> If I were new, I would have definitely liked my hero academia
[23:09:03] <saganman> I like tog probably because of it's peculiar plot and depth
[23:09:18] <emmeka> I mean like most people my age I watched DBZ basically religiously when it was on the air here, but by the time I sat down for a serious rewatch of it, I had already been "seriously" into anime for a few years.
[23:09:21] <Bco1981> Strong Zero peach is muuuch better
[23:10:10] <emmeka> I think the first shounen I watched seriously, actually keeping up with weekly episodes and fangirling about, was Inuyasha
[23:10:14] <saganman> I didn't get to watch all the arcs on tv
[23:10:41] <saganman> for me it was FMA 2002 version
[23:10:47] <emmeka> and Inuyasha will always have a special place in my heart because of that, but I'm not sure I could in good faith recommend it
[23:11:12] <emmeka> saganman I watched bits and pieces of the original FMA on TV, but it never really caught my attention until Brotherhood came out.
[23:11:22] <saganman> inuyasha is good
[23:11:38] <emmeka> Inuyasha is good, but gets repetitive. But so do all shounens.
[23:12:44] <saganman> FMA has emotional side to it, I liked it back then
[23:13:16] <saganman> and also the brajta song coupled with Ed trying to revive his mother in past
[23:13:23] <saganman> hit the spot
[23:13:25] <emmeka> who would ever forget Shou Tucker's arc
[23:13:34] <saganman> yeah
[23:14:24] <saganman> and also the scene where Ed rips off his right hand cloth to show what will happen when they try to reach god
[23:14:29] <saganman> damn, it was epic

[23:21:54] <saganman> haven't heard of that, what do you think about it emmeka?
[23:22:18] <emmeka> that it's completely ridiculous, but good if you want to turn your brain off
[23:22:31] <saganman> emmeka: has she watched seitokai yakuindomo? she will love it!
[23:22:48] <saganman> and also d-frag!
[23:23:00] <saganman> love hina!!!
[23:23:18] <saganman> thankfully duck isn't online
[23:23:35] <saganman> he always comes up to shit on love hina
[23:23:36] <Bco1981> saganman: but that's a ecchi harem show ?
[23:23:44] <saganman> yes Bco1981 
[23:23:58] <Bco1981> i didn't think you liked those.
[23:24:17] <emmeka> I have committed a terrible crime, I created another anime fan but one whose anime consumption and preferences consists of 100% trash
[23:24:26] <saganman> I watched love hina quite early back in early 20s. 
[23:24:33] <Bco1981> ah
[23:24:58] <saganman> Bco1981: I am not shounen type. I love shojo anime too
[23:25:01] <Bco1981> emmeka: my son said that, right now it's "in" to watch anime in his class.
[23:25:21] <emmeka> anime seems pretty normalized for zoomers
[23:25:35] <Bco1981> he want's to watch attack on titans... but he is only 12... so i'm kinda reluctant
[23:25:38] <saganman> anime is mainstream now
[23:25:56] <saganman> nah, stick with ghibli movies for now Bco1981 
[23:26:00] <Guest1097> just like how superheroes are mainstream
[23:26:07] <Guest1097> people used to laugh at nerds
[23:26:08] * emmeka waves cane - back in my day, we were considered total weirdos when we hijacked a projector room during exam week to watch Hetalia
[23:26:52] <saganman> I also used to read those smug mc romance manga Bco1981 
[23:27:10] <saganman> all back in the day
[23:27:11] <Bco1981> saganman: name one
[23:27:12] <emmeka> saganman we have a real shoujo anime this season! it's been a while.
[23:27:19] <saganman> Bco1981: l-dk
[23:27:22] <emmeka> less and less true shoujo anime recently
[23:27:49] <saganman> Bco1981: the most popular of them all is probably kaichou wa maid sama
[23:28:07] <Bco1981> that's good!

[23:28:37] <saganman> Bco1981: have you read namaikizakari?
[23:28:50] <emmeka> saganman I too am a total sucker for shoujo
[23:28:54] <Bco1981> name rings no bell
[23:29:17] <Bco1981> Vohveli: oh... lol
[23:29:24] <emmeka> I think part of the problem though is that a lot of formerly exclusively shoujo plots/tropes have started showing up in other demographics
[23:29:28] <saganman> nice emmeka, which is the one you are talking about?
[23:29:32] <Bco1981> lady secrets
[23:29:41] <emmeka> saganman Kageki Shoujo

[23:30:01] <saganman> Bco1981: karekano?
[23:30:15] <Bco1981> god damn, smoll
[23:30:21] <Bco1981> that's like half a human
[23:30:35] <Bco1981> saganman: neither
[23:30:52] <Vohveli> chat goes "please eat more"
[23:30:54] <saganman> emmeka: just looked it up, good
[23:30:54] <Bco1981> saganman: any one of them that turned into anime ?
[23:31:01] <Bco1981> Vohveli: lol yeah
[23:31:30] <saganman> yeah Bco1981, there is karekano anime but they only did one part
[23:31:43] <Bco1981> !a 
[23:31:43] <Bco1981> 20:58 < Bco1981> that's good!

[23:32:08] <saganman> one arc*
[23:32:15] <Bco1981> ah that on i have watched
[23:32:18] <Bco1981> one*
[23:32:43] <emmeka> I have meant to watch/read Karekano for years
[23:32:45] <emmeka> and never done it
[23:33:30] <saganman> Bco1981: marmalade boy?
[23:33:32] <Bco1981> Vohveli: i have been reluctant to buy a swich, just for ring fit.. and seen these "tiny girls" play it makes it look very hard..
[23:33:45] <Bco1981> saganman: yes, long but at the end it was good.
[23:34:01] <saganman> yeah
[23:34:09] <saganman> it has  complex plot
[23:34:23] <saganman> Bco1981: kokoro connect?
[23:34:26] *** Quits: Guest1097 (~Guest10@generic.nshealth.ca) (Quit: Client closed)
[23:34:31] <emmeka> I think shoujo anime have become rarer just because the same plots have moved to shounen/seinen. Look at shows like Horimiya, Tonikaku Kawaii, Villainness, Bookworm recently. All of those would've been squarely shoujo material like 15 years ago.
[23:34:55] <Bco1981> saganman: yeeaas, teach a girl how to stop a man in a instant.
[23:34:56] <saganman> wait, horimiya is not shoujo?
[23:35:07] <ImoutoBot> New episode for: Tokyo Revengers | Episode: 23
[23:35:07] <emmeka> nope, oddly enough
[23:35:15] <saganman> that's odd
[23:35:32] <saganman> Bco1981: ai yori aoshi?
[23:35:57] <Bco1981> oh yeah, the perfect wife
[23:36:16] <saganman> emmeka: I used to read Horimiya but stopped somewhere in middle
[23:36:37] <saganman> emmeka: we need intense romance shoujo like fushigi yuugi
[23:36:45] <saganman> feel the emotions!
[23:36:45] <Bco1981> she is probably top tier waifu, cooks, cleans, supportive, understanding, and gives space...
[23:36:59] <saganman> Bco1981: she is yamato nadeshiko
[23:37:11] <saganman> Bco1981: ore monogatari?
[23:37:17] <Bco1981> not yet
[23:37:21] <emmeka> Ai yori aoshi was kind of unique in its time. The main coupled are engaged right from the first chapter.
[23:37:42] <saganman> yeah
[23:37:56] <saganman> I fucking loved it emmeka 
[23:38:08] <emmeka> but they have to hide it because plot reasons, so it's a harem anime with a secretly engaged main couple
[23:38:28] <Bco1981> understanding as in, she does not hit the guy because one of the other girls did something "inapropriet"
[23:38:29] <emmeka> Ore Monogatari is actually amazing
[23:38:39] <saganman> it is amazing!!
[23:38:54] <Bco1981> it' always the gus fault was no in Ai yori aoshi

[23:39:12] <saganman> yeah
[23:39:25] <saganman> the mc has baggage from the past
[23:39:45] <saganman> Bco1981: my bride is a mermaid?
[23:39:53] <Bco1981> yes
[23:39:54] <saganman> I wonder if that is shoujo
[23:40:05] <Bco1981> kinda out there.
[23:40:08] <emmeka> Ore Monogatari is probably the best "post-confession" shoujo series ever done, really.
[23:40:28] <saganman> hehe, true emmeka 
[23:40:28] <emmeka> even if its artstyle is a bit weird
[23:41:07] <saganman> Bco1981: what about akatsuki no yona?
[23:41:13] <Bco1981> YEAS!
[23:41:21] <saganman> gawd I love that one
[23:41:32] <Bco1981> is that a manga? or source is LN ?
[23:41:44] <emmeka> manga, ongoing.
[23:41:48] <Bco1981> oh
[23:41:52] <saganman> yeah
[23:42:03] <Bco1981> i need to read, because the anime the story just started!
[23:42:04] <emmeka> I've meant to buy the paperbacks of Yona since forever, I just keep a few alerts up for when there's a sale
[23:42:53] <saganman> I guess you have all the known ones Bco1981 
[23:43:11] <saganman> Bco1981: what about gakuen alice? I wonder if it's shoujo
[23:43:18] <saganman> it has romance though
[23:43:35] <Bco1981> no~ ?
[23:43:55] <saganman> it is good
[23:44:06] <saganman> just checked, it is shoujo
[23:44:53] <saganman> what else? what am I forgetting?
[23:44:55] <saganman> hrmm
[23:45:09] <saganman> Bco1981: ao haru ride?
[23:45:50] <saganman> you probably watched that one too and also kimi no todoke
[23:45:59] <Bco1981> i am unsure about this one. seems familiar
[23:46:16] <Bco1981> kimi no todoke, oh yes
[23:46:40] <Bco1981> even watched the live action
