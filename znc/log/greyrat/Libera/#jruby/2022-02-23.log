[18:00:19] <enebo[m]>  headius cool
[18:01:31] <headius> test:mri:core:int passes and I think most other failures are due to jit having fired and we can't go back to simple

[20:44:06] <johnblood[m]> I'm new to Ruby. What is the benefit of using jruby over the main Ruby interpreter?
[20:50:06] <enebo[m]> johnblood: we have native threads vs a global interpreter lock.  we can interoperate with Java from a Ruby syntax.  we can perform better.  If you combine native threads with performance we use less resources having a single multi-threaded process for let's say a Rails server than having multiple servers.
[20:55:40] <johnblood[m]> <enebo[m]> "johnblood: we have native..." <- Thanks
