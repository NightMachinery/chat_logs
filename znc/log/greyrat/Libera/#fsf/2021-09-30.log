[00:54:26] <Neopolitan> Really they're just telling you that they're so uninteresting that they've never done, well, anything.
[00:54:39] <Neopolitan> Also, the next time someone says they ahve nothing to hide, ask to see their passwords and their porn folder.
[00:54:47] <potatoxel[m]> Lol
[00:54:52] <Neopolitan> Then when they inevitably refuse, indicate that it seems they do have something to hide indeed
[00:55:39] <potatoxel[m]> they'd probably say, i have nothing to hide to discord. and maybe like trust discord or the government or somethin
[00:55:41] <potatoxel[m]> idk

[01:20:20] <kreyren[m]> *didn't
[01:23:47] <potatoxel[m]> im not sure how feasible this is, i mean assuming u did it, and no legal issue (not legal advice), nice now there is content, but the content is also on facebook, people would hesitate to move from facebook to your site because they dont trust you (for some reason they trust facebook), maybe they just "have nothing to hide", and maybe their  friends dont wanna move thus they dont want to move there (you can't scrape chat).
[01:24:33] <potatoxel[m]> idk,just some of the reasons why my friends dont wanna use matrix, is cuz their friends dont wanna switch (i feel like there is an infinite loop here).
[01:24:40] <kreyren[m]> From what i've seen the content posted on facebook is facebook's property so i am currently just planning to make it as a good will gesture for voltEuropa to cry over their mistakes
[01:25:01] <potatoxel[m]> well i dont remember their TOS
[01:25:28] <potatoxel[m]> but usually its that the user owns they copyright, while the company can do anything with the content.

[02:37:19] <kreyren[m]> xx: nah sauvin == torvalds
[02:37:37] <Noisytoot> how do you know?
[02:37:41] <xx> strongly doubt that, due to sauvin's dislike of SMS-speak and torvalds' no mention of that ever
[02:37:56] <kreyren[m]> Noisytoot: i have strong sense of smell on people~
[02:38:14] <xx> kreyren[m]: buy them soap then
[02:39:38] <Noisytoot> someone just said this in #linux: <rasta> makes me wonder... what would happen in this channel if one day torvalds came here and say 'hey I'm Linus' oh man
[02:39:38] <Noisytoot> <rasta> maybe he is here, we just don't know heh =]
[02:40:01] <kreyren[m]> xx: torvalds have to bend the knee to OSI lobbists who took over Linux foundation he doesn't have the luxury of free speech to say that publicly~

[16:05:26] <DiffieHellman> In my opinion, if you intend to only run good free software, 8GB of RAM is perfectly sufficient. I have a number of computers with 8GB RAM and they work great. Just avoid rust pretty much.

[16:10:07] <DiffieHellman> If you're doing rendering, then a desktop rather than a laptop is for you.
