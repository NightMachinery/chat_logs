[07:06:06] <corn266> we used papercut back in college and it worked well enough. some of the xerox machines were aids to maintain but it was fun to get drunk, stumble into the library, and tell the guy that managed the printers that there was an issue when there wasn't

[09:32:33] <xe0n> LOL
[09:32:37] <Jay-Ros> look, it's a fuckin beard
[09:32:46] <Jay-Ros> if you're going to do a rollback plan, there's no feasibility
[09:33:01] <Jay-Ros> you just do like the germans, measure eight times cut once
[09:33:56] <Jay-Ros> but you need to do an assessment, impact analysis, due diligence on alternative changes (hairs to cut), evaluation of final modelling and whether the implementation satisfies all requirementz
[09:34:01] <xe0n> or measure once and cut eight times
[09:34:37] <Jay-Ros> then once the change has been made, a post-change evaluation process, followed by a lifecycle-completion by new review of beard trimming activities

[09:35:17] <Jay-Ros> fair call, first increase in a while
[09:35:28] <Jay-Ros> growth must've slowed down
[09:35:47] <catbeard> yea -- sharkpuppet
[09:36:53] <catbeard> okay so i need to put together a pentesting overview / general outline of service scopes, and then a "menu" of sorts of services to pick from, and suggestions for bundling
[09:37:08] <Jay-Ros> mspaint can do all that
[09:37:21] <catbeard> got 1 full scope audit and one cheapskate audit but they're both good for it
[09:37:31] <Jay-Ros> just use mspaint?
[09:37:40] <Jay-Ros> and a html page
[09:38:09] <xe0n> LOL
[09:38:14] <xe0n> nah just excel it
[09:38:16] <xe0n> :P
[09:38:17] <catbeard> like we're going to be using hundreds of lesser-known / custom tools / msf / sqlmap hard mode / tor / phishing / se 
[09:38:26] <catbeard> so we'll need to provide a comprehensive report
[09:38:41] <Jay-Ros> yeah html has a scroll option now
[09:38:48] <Jay-Ros> easy street
[09:39:03] <catbeard> that's not the problem, it's the pre-discovery phase of the engagement, we don't know and they don't know the targets yet
[09:39:12] <Jay-Ros> that's what mspaint's for
[09:39:13] <catbeard> they don't know what they should be looking for
[09:39:17] <Jay-Ros> you draw lines in mspaint
[09:39:19] <catbeard> we do
[09:39:21] <Jay-Ros> then display them on html
[09:39:21] <xe0n> yeah so thats a process thing within your team
[09:39:22] <xe0n> lol
[09:39:28] <catbeard> but they're not technical people
[09:39:30] <xe0n> you dont need to tell the client till the end report
[09:39:32] <catbeard> it's a team of 2 at the moment
[09:39:41] <xe0n> just say let us plug in and go for it
[09:39:43] <xe0n> and then show results
[09:39:47] <xe0n> sooo this is what we discovered...
[09:39:52] <xe0n> recommendations for remediation
[09:39:54] <xe0n> etc
[09:40:06] <xe0n> also make the report readable and presentable
[09:40:06] <catbeard> ya but we need to secure the contract for this, so we need to provide a "brochure" going over what's included in the pentest for custom scoping and full scoping
[09:40:08] <xe0n> else failll
[09:40:11] <Jay-Ros> do you want an example pentest report?
[09:40:19] <Jay-Ros> would that be helpful?
[09:40:20] <catbeard> no, i need a pentesting brochure
[09:40:27] <xe0n> ms publisher can do that
[09:40:29] <Jay-Ros> I think I have one of them too
[09:40:30] <catbeard> though depending on the visual quality of the report maybe
[09:40:35] <Jay-Ros> let me crack open mspaint, one sec
[09:40:41] <catbeard> :|
[09:40:48] <xe0n> clippy: hey catbeard! looks like you're writing a brochure for pentests, may i suggest screenshots of random techno babble?
[09:40:50] <catbeard> at least visio you heathen
[09:41:07] <Jay-Ros> visio's limited in functionality
[09:41:11] <Jay-Ros> there's no spraycan setting
[09:41:13] <xe0n> visio for brochure?!
[09:41:14] <xe0n> what
[09:41:15] <xe0n> LOL
[09:41:24] <catbeard> well to build the network diagrams
[09:41:27] <xe0n> flowchart...sure....brochure...desktop publishing...yeah dunno
[09:41:30] <xe0n> sure...
[09:41:33] <catbeard> to screenshot into the personalized brochure
[09:41:48] <Jay-Ros> snippy does that
[09:41:50] <xe0n> sounds like you'll need to use a mac for this
[09:41:51] <xe0n> better buy 5
[09:41:52] <catbeard> so we can clearly define what's out of scope
[09:41:56] <Jay-Ros> sorry shouold've mentioned I use snippy too
[09:42:01] <xe0n> snagit yo!
[09:42:05] <Jay-Ros> nah snippy
[09:42:12] <xe0n> i actually have greenshot installed, cant say ive used it
[09:42:13] <xe0n> LOL
[09:42:28] <Jay-Ros> yeah I can't remember which machines I've got greenshot installed on
[09:42:37] <Jay-Ros> so I generally [win] + 3
[09:42:47] <Jay-Ros> (that's where snippy lives in my taskbar)
[09:43:02] <xe0n> if you hold down windows key in 11 it gives you a list of keyboard shortcuts
[09:43:04] <xe0n> is that the same in 10
[09:43:06] <xe0n> cant say ive done that
[09:43:06] <xe0n> lol
[09:43:08] <catbeard> like, i have web auditing handled, but then there's like service discovery, fuzzing, enumeration, CVE checks, low hanging fruit, then finally bruteforce and by hand exploitation if needed
[09:43:15] <Jay-Ros> no
[09:43:28] <xe0n> yeah half of those words average joe aint going to understand
[09:43:34] <catbeard> censys, shodan, and securitytrails reverse discovery
[09:43:45] <xe0n> brochure needs to be in easy to understand language, if they want clarification on something (ie. technical info) they'll also
[09:43:48] <catbeard> good shit, all api'd
[09:43:50] *** runcmd is now known as zerocool
[09:43:52] <xe0n> dont make a brochure with a bunch of techno babble
[09:43:56] <Jay-Ros> could you present it in a .bmp to me instead of using words?
[09:44:04] <xe0n> use kid pix to make it
[09:44:06] <xe0n> good images there
[09:44:24] <Jay-Ros> I like the logitech camera software in meetings on webcam
[09:44:25] <catbeard> yes that's future, but right now just need suggestions for a good template for that, so i can just pay someone to have the text written
[09:44:27] <Jay-Ros> I can be a shark...
[09:44:35] <xe0n> maybe you make the template?
[09:44:51] <catbeard> i mean i pay a VA to make reports
[09:45:01] <catbeard> i just don't know what to tell him
[09:45:06] <catbeard> because the client doesn't have a clue
[09:45:14] <xe0n> you can't write a report yourself?
[09:45:14] <xe0n> lol
[09:45:18] <catbeard> and i'm not in direct contact with the client
[09:45:22] <catbeard> i can write the report
[09:45:29] <catbeard> but we haven't even accepted the job yet
[09:45:32] <xe0n> sure
[09:45:34] <xe0n> so whats the issue?

[13:30:06] <haise01> cause I wanted to try Server 2022
[13:30:39] <haise01> in the end I just did complete CPU passthrough (host-passthrough option) and its not locking surprisingly

[14:14:59] <teh_f4ll3n> Anyway, I have along project list, but read-only Friday
[14:15:12] <Joe-Developer> I was the same teh_f4ll3n 
[14:15:28] <Joe-Developer> thought "hmm I might bash thru this and that so I don't have to deal with it tomorrow"
[14:15:41] <Joe-Developer> then realised it was read-only friday so, Mondays job they are.
[14:16:15] <teh_f4ll3n> yeah, fuck working on infra projects on Fridays :D
[14:16:35] <teh_f4ll3n> documentation day, I guess
[14:16:58] <teh_f4ll3n> and L2 support day
[14:18:16] <teh_f4ll3n> btw, nordVPN is a pile of steaming shit
[14:18:32] <haise01> why the fuck would you use that lol
[14:18:37] <haise01> Mullvad exists
[14:18:40] <teh_f4ll3n> even if it's not connected, it messes with other VPNs
[14:18:45] <teh_f4ll3n> I don't
[14:19:51] <teh_f4ll3n> a colleague had it on his Mac along with work VPN. If NordVPN was running - just running, not even connected - work VPN wouldn't connect
[14:20:21] <AliceMeows> It was probably binding to some ports by default
[14:20:40] <sd> 02<S​ir Sceptalot> but.. but.. my favourite youtuber says it's the bees knees
[14:20:52] <haise01> lmao
[14:21:02] <teh_f4ll3n> Thus I said it was a pile of shit. You don't bind ports until you connect
[14:21:11] <haise01> ^
[14:21:14] <yuken> hmm. 32KB of RAM...
[14:21:23] <teh_f4ll3n> TI-87?
[14:21:28] <yuken> if I'm doing a 320x240 framebuffer, that's 76,800 bytes. 
[14:21:28] <yuken> mfw
[14:21:44] <yuken> er
[14:21:55] <haise01> time to see how cross platform my automation junk is
[14:21:56] <yuken> assuming 8-bit color, which is actually not what I want.
[14:21:58] <teh_f4ll3n> they sent Apollo to the moon with that much RAM afaik
[14:22:01] <haise01> Installing Ansible and Terraform on Windows
[14:22:02] <yuken> wait no
[14:22:18] <yuken> okay - monochrome, 320x240, is 9.6KB.
[14:22:25] <haise01> teh_f4ll3n: thats still mind boggling to me till this day, its so fucking impressive to me
[14:22:29] <yuken> so realistically probably 18.2KB because double buffering.
[14:22:48] <yuken> teh_f4ll3n, I'm trying to build a computer with a 6502.
[14:22:52] <yuken> Or maybe a 68010.
[14:22:58] <teh_f4ll3n> sweet
[14:23:36] <yuken> and I'm trying to figure out a... realistic amount of RAM.
[14:23:47] <teh_f4ll3n> 64GB
[14:23:50] <teh_f4ll3n> :D
[14:24:00] <AliceMeows> And hack it up with PAE, right?
[14:24:08] <AliceMeows> Idk how else you'd get the cpu to support that much memory
[14:24:08] <Hunterkll> use the 6502 or z80 
[14:24:11] <Hunterkll> and do like, 64k ram 
[14:24:15] <Hunterkll> or even 32k
[14:24:17] <haise01> ^
[14:24:26] <Hunterkll> keep it simple you fucking moron like i told you the other day
[14:24:27] <Hunterkll> lol
[14:24:33] <yuken> Hunterkll, yar. 32K seems a bit too little if I want a 320x240 frame.
[14:24:45] <yuken> assuming I'm addressing each pixel individually.
[14:26:32] <teh_f4ll3n> I had this thing back in the day: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobbit_(computer)
[14:26:35] <teh_f4ll3n> 64K
[14:27:15] <Hunterkll> yuken: original apple II had 4KB .....
[14:27:22] <Hunterkll> expandable up to 48KB 
[14:27:30] <yuken> Hunterkll, jesus cheerist.
[14:27:32] <Hunterkll> my IIe only has 64KB 
[14:27:39] <Hunterkll> well, 128 if you count the addin card too 
[14:28:16] <Hunterkll> honestly, start with 16KB and go from there
[14:28:21] <Hunterkll> you can get that in a single DIP chip
[14:28:25] <Hunterkll> makes wiring/prototyping easier
[14:28:40] <yuken> well, if I want 320 * 240, that's 76800 pixels. So assuming monochrome on or of, 76.8KB.
[14:28:44] <teh_f4ll3n> make your own watercooled memory modules. a breadboard and 65,000+ transistors :D 
[14:28:59] <Hunterkll> yuken: yea the apple did color
[14:29:00] <Hunterkll> try again
[14:29:01] <Hunterkll> :P

[14:34:09] <yuken> hmm. I wonder how a framebuffer would work at this level, to display it out to a monitor. I'd probably not even have a separate processor for monitor handling, so I'd need to figure out stuff like... handling timing while simultaneously running an application.
[14:35:36] *** Joins: AliceMeows (~Alice@93-173-219-217.bb.netvision.net.il)
[14:35:57] <AliceMeows> Sorry, connection dropped. I hope I didn't miss any answers
[14:36:19] <teh_f4ll3n> you didn't LD
[14:36:19] <yuken> although I guess if I did that, I'd basically be killing the CPU the entire time we're not in an idle VGA... time.
[14:36:20] <teh_f4ll3n> :D
[14:36:52] <yuken> so I probably would need a separate video card, and a way to send a framebuffer to it.
[14:37:16] <Hunterkll> do composite video
[14:37:20] <Hunterkll> there's generation chips that do the work for you
[14:37:22] <Hunterkll> much easier
[14:37:31] <Oliber> https://twitter.com/TriciaLockwood/status/1428438388403810309
[14:37:49] <Oliber> that's one hell of a trip
[14:38:10] <yuken> Hunterkll, well, I'd probably still need separate RAM for graphics - so that the thing reading memory to get my output isn't doing that while the CPU is trying to access it.
[14:38:25] <Hunterkll> no......
[14:38:35] <yuken> wot
[14:39:23] <teh_f4ll3n> Battlebots now on Netflix lol
[14:39:23] <Hunterkll> well, there's a few different ways to handle it 
[14:39:38] <teh_f4ll3n> no, Netflix, you will not lure me back in
[14:40:06] <haise01> teh_f4ll3n: Plex 4 lyfe lol
[14:40:46] <teh_f4ll3n> yup
[14:41:27] <yuken> Hunterkll, as far as I know, I can't read and write simultaneously to memory, especially separate addresses. So, while I'm displaying stuff, I'd either need to basically kill CPU's access to memory or halt it entirely, or have separate memory for VRAM and flush it during the end of a frame.
[14:41:30] <yuken> is that not right?
[14:41:45] <Hunterkll> yes and no
[14:41:46] <Hunterkll> :D

[14:42:32] <Hunterkll> this design here uses a slice of main system memory as the video memory
[14:42:35] <Hunterkll> maybe study into this a bit
[14:42:37] <Hunterkll> it is 320x240 
[14:43:00] <Hunterkll> 8KB ROM + 56K RAM to equal 64KB addrss space total
[14:43:10] <Hunterkll> using 9600 bytes for video memory out of that 56K
[14:43:49] <Hunterkll> and that's doing a bit more 'hardcore' video generation than just using one of the TM chips
[14:44:31] <Hunterkll> and yes you can just buy a kit and assemble it if you want :p
[14:44:39] <yuken> How the hekk
[14:44:49] <yuken> hm.
[14:45:42] <Hunterkll> Connecting the video display memory (video RAM, VRAM) was another complicated problem. The VRAM has to be connected to the system address and data buses when the CPU is placing data into it, but connected to the video display when putting dots onto the screen. When connected to the display, the VRAM gets its address from a byte counter, which is incremented every 8 dots and is reset when the end of the display frame 
[14:45:43] <Hunterkll> is reached. A multiplexer selects an address from either the system address bus or the display byte counter, depending on a signal derived from the synch pulse outputs. Basically, the system will allow the CPU to put data into the VRAM only during the synch pulse intervals. During the time that the display is on, the system generates a WAIT input to the CPU if the CPU wants to read or write to an address in the VRAM 
[14:45:43] <Hunterkll> range. The VRAM data bus is connected directly to the display shift register, and to the system data bus through a bi-directional buffer. The synch pulse signals control this data bus buffer so that it is open only during the synch pulse time, when the display is off.
[14:45:48] <Hunterkll> is the part that you really need to understand
[14:45:49] <yuken> yar, I'm reading that Hunterkll.
[14:46:24] <Hunterkll> https://www.eevblog.com/forum/projects/z80-video-board/
[14:46:25] <Hunterkll> for more ideas
[14:46:28] <yuken> From what I understand... whenever a byte is needed (8 counts), it's put onto a register to be displayed. And during the rest of everything, the CPU is free to access RAM.
[14:46:38] <yuken> let's see..
[14:46:41] <Hunterkll> but yea woz's 6502 design like they say 
[14:46:42] <Hunterkll> is hilarious
[14:46:51] <Hunterkll> because it also is the ram refresh cycle at the same time 
[14:46:52] <Hunterkll> :D

[14:47:07] <yuken> o shit.
[14:47:13] <Hunterkll> .....
[14:47:16] <yuken> I just copied the exact same lines.
[14:49:08] <yuken> Hunterkll, well, it says that the CPU is told to wait if it's grabbing an address in VRAM range, while it's being used for the display. The only way I see that working is two separate pieces of RAM, one just for VRAM...
[14:49:13] <Aoyagi_raventop> https://www.techpowerup.com/285766/gigabyte-amd-intel-confidential-documents-published-online
[14:49:22] <Hunterkll> no.....
[14:49:30] <Hunterkll> cpu isn't allowed to fetch while it's doing display work
[14:49:40] <Hunterkll> it's not separate ram at all
[14:49:47] <Hunterkll> just a dedicated address range in main system ram
[14:49:53] <Hunterkll> ram is connected to both video and cpu at the same time
[14:49:54] <Hunterkll> :D
[14:49:59] <yuken> yes, I know.
[14:50:07] <yuken> But surely that would cause the CPU to not be able to access ANY memory.

[16:17:04] <Joe-Developer> 100%
[16:17:19] <Hunterkll> yesh
[16:17:20] <Joe-Developer> don't need a page dedicated to networking commands that anyone can google
[16:17:20] <sd> 13<b​ug> Too much then?
[16:17:21] <Hunterkll> 4 pages
[16:17:30] <Hunterkll> i have to fight to keep mine down to two 
[16:17:32] <sd> 06<A​da> yeah, get rid of the command names, they all fall under "standard linux utilities"
[16:18:05] <sd> 13<b​ug> The reason why I added these initially was because I was told to include everything, to be as verbose as possible
[16:18:15] <Joe-Developer> yeah
[16:18:17] <sd> 13<b​ug> and then demonstrate if needed
[16:18:26] <Joe-Developer> include everything but in as little space as possible
[16:18:57] <Hunterkll> I have something like 
[16:18:58] <Hunterkll> Linux and Unix skills include Apache, MySQL, PHP, Perl, Awk, Sed, RegEx. Linux Distributions such as Red Hat, Debian, SuSE, and Ubuntu. UNIX variants such as Solaris, AIX, HP-UX, and BSD
[16:19:04] <Joe-Developer> think an employer would take one look at that, see the page full of bullet points and probably move onto the next CV
[16:19:08] <Hunterkll> that about sums up your entire page 3 
[16:19:08] <Hunterkll> lol
[16:19:24] <Hunterkll> obviously not the best and could be better
[16:19:32] <Hunterkll> but it gets me callbacks and interviews, so *shrug*
[16:19:37] <teh_f4ll3n> unless there are specific CV requirements for that place, no one's going to read pages of bullet points
[16:19:59] <sd> 13<b​ug> Ok, so if you're in a supervisor position and wanted a junior, what would you expect?
[16:20:11] <Joe-Developer> something like what Hunterkll said
[16:20:16] <sd> 13<b​ug> Ok
[16:20:17] <Joe-Developer> sum up what you can use
[16:20:19] <Oliber> include everything and be as verbose as possible on a CV? eeeeeeeeh, each job should be a couple of sentences max, experience a list of operating sytems/environments you have used
[16:20:22] <Hunterkll> I really should rip out that awk/sed/regex bullshit
[16:20:27] <Joe-Developer> but you don't need to say every command you know
[16:20:51] <teh_f4ll3n> Oliber, do you want to read a biography?
[16:21:10] <Joe-Developer> it's like saying you speak French as a second language and then writing every French word you know on your CV
[16:21:11] <sd> 13<b​ug> what about being able to demonstrate? I really don't want to lie and have some sort of proof that I can do what I can do. Is there anyway I can make this stick out without the aforementioned 4 pages
[16:21:12] <sd> 13<b​ug> ?
[16:21:31] <teh_f4ll3n> because that's what you get when you "include everything and be as verbose as possible" :D
[16:21:33] <sd> 13<b​ug> again, just by keeping it short and explain if they ask right?
[16:21:38] <Joe-Developer> yeah
[16:21:57] <Joe-Developer> coz if they want to know more about something you've put they'll ask you to expand during an interview
[16:22:20] <sd> 13<b​ug> sweet, ok
[16:22:21] <Joe-Developer> and *then* you can go as in depth as you want, just don't bore them to sleep

[16:22:56] <Joe-Developer> ^ that's Hunterkll's entire CV
[16:23:04] <Oliber> an important skill to have, which you may well have is being able to determine the ability of a user and explain/troubleshoot at a suitable level
[16:23:05] <Joe-Developer> 1 line, no punctuation
[16:23:12] <sd> 06<A​da> @bug the bullet points there can just be summed up as "standard linux utilities", maybe with a line as well about being fine in multiple distros
[16:23:23] <Hunterkll> i've had some practical shit in interviews before, but it was like, bare bones "are you not retarded" shit like "what exchange server is this outlook client connected to" on a laptop handed to me 
[16:23:30] <sd> 06<A​da> that leaves it pretty accurate to what you listed
[16:23:36] <Hunterkll> but that was for a junior position anyway
[16:24:08] <Hunterkll> "what domain controller did this login session authenticate against"
[16:24:20] <Hunterkll> low level crap like that, higher level stuff i've never had to do any practical BS at all
[16:25:40] <Hunterkll> Also, if you've had actual work history as a sysadmin, i'm pretty sure you can drop things like A+ at this point unless a job posting is specifically asking for it, lol
[16:26:03] <teh_f4ll3n> A+ ...
[16:26:08] <sd> 13<b​ug> Is it worth mentioning anything about education then?

[17:10:20] <Hunterkll> it's hilarious
[17:10:21] <sd> 02<P​arker> yeah that what I thought but better to ask wise people
[17:10:44] <sintax> @Parker if you're here for wise people you've been led astray :)
[17:10:47] <haise01> jesus christ
[17:11:06] <nobyk> Jokes on you, I'm wise as fuck
[17:11:11] <PublicWiFi> lets emulate x86 on a z80
[17:11:17] <sintax> ooh side note, i'm replacing physical servers this weekend. might get three dell r710's i think they are
[17:11:18] <haise01> sure thing
[17:11:19] <Hunterkll> PublicWiFi: you joke, but it's been done

[17:11:33] <PublicWiFi> Hunterkll: yeah and I think one guy even boot ubuntu?
[17:11:33] <haise01> sintax: Get 12th gen or higher
[17:11:36] <haise01> like R720s
[17:11:42] <sintax> haise01: these will be free :)
[17:11:45] <PublicWiFi> haise01: took it like one week to hit the login prompt or something? lol
[17:11:46] <sintax> let me go see what they are

[17:11:48] <sintax> brb
[17:11:57] * sintax to the server room!
[17:12:01] <haise01> sintax: flip them on ebay and buy better server lol
[17:12:01] <Hunterkll> actuall;y
[17:12:03] <Hunterkll> that wasn't a z80
[17:12:05] <PublicWiFi> oh
[17:12:06] <Hunterkll> it was a fuckin arduino
[17:12:06] <Hunterkll> lol
[17:12:08] <PublicWiFi> LOL
[17:12:10] <PublicWiFi> ah
[17:12:11] <sintax> haise01: it crossed my mind!
[17:12:13] <haise01> there are always kids who will buy them cause Minecraft server

[17:13:26] <CptLuxx> lol
[17:13:26] <nobyk> Looks like a minefield
[17:13:48] <haise01> Hunterkll: I have mix of 6 and 8 TB drives
[17:13:49] <Hunterkll> yea
[17:13:53] <Hunterkll> i just slap in whatever i have laying around
[17:13:56] <haise01> across HP G8 and Supermicro CSE 826
[17:14:00] <Hunterkll> take the disk with the worst smart stats when i get a better one
[17:14:02] <Hunterkll> and replace them 
[17:14:02] <Hunterkll> lol
[17:14:05] <Hunterkll> continually growing
[17:14:11] <Hunterkll> eventually the 3.5" shelf will be all 18TB SAS disks
[17:14:20] <sd> 13<C​olour> Huhh
[17:14:21] <Hunterkll> but that's happening over the course of like, 2 years 
[17:14:29] <sd> 13<C​olour> I might swap over eventually
[17:14:34] <haise01> I got HP DL380p G8 for $200

[17:14:57] <Hunterkll> lol
[17:15:05] <Hunterkll> same host, just different storage pool

[17:15:32] <Hunterkll> haven't done the bare metal host yet 
[17:15:33] <Hunterkll> :D
[17:15:33] <teh_f4ll3n> mmm... home-made Thai Green Curry beats your storage screenshots
[17:15:43] <Hunterkll> @Colour just get some decent pass through HBAs and ignore the rest 
[17:15:50] <haise01> SMB over QUIC seems like interesting idea
[17:15:52] <Joe-Developer> teh_f4ll3n, do share.
[17:16:04] <teh_f4ll3n> i sec
[17:16:11] <teh_f4ll3n> 1 sec*
[17:16:14] <Hunterkll> Adaptec 7805Q is pretty good
[17:16:25] <Hunterkll> and instead of battery backup, it's new enough it uses a supercapacitor for backup power instead 
[17:16:27] <haise01> Hunterkll: What RAID level do you use again (like RAID 0/1/6...)
[17:16:30] <Hunterkll> so you dont have to worry about it faulting
[17:16:39] <Hunterkll> haise01: 3-way mirroring for important data, 2-way for stuff i don't necessarily care about 
[17:16:48] <haise01> ah alright
[17:16:51] <Hunterkll> i have a few dual-parity slices too which would be analogous to raid-6 
[17:17:26] <haise01> My strat is too have often backup of most important data
[17:17:28] <Hunterkll> but yea
[17:17:36] <Hunterkll> I have LTO backup for that 
[17:17:36] <Hunterkll> ;)
[17:17:40] <haise01> I have them in Backblaze mostly
[17:17:49] <PublicWiFi> hoyl fucking shit
[17:17:51] <Hunterkll> @Colour an adaptec 7805 is what i'd call 'good enough' and it's 12gbit, and you don't have to reflash it for passthrough, etc 
[17:17:57] <PublicWiFi> I HATE retarded ass software companies
[17:18:02] <Hunterkll> i paid $75 for mine
[17:18:02] <haise01> cause one earthquake is enough to shit on backup and main server
[17:18:04] <sd> 13<C​olour> I might be able to do 8x12tb raid 6 hmm
[17:18:06] <Hunterkll> it's only 8 port but still
[17:18:12] <Hunterkll> yea it'll do raid-6 too just fine
[17:18:15] <sd> 13<C​olour> I have a hba for 8 disks already
[17:18:19] <Hunterkll> and it's good enough you won't have any real performance penalty 
[17:18:25] <PublicWiFi> we found some retarded ass bug in this phone recording software, devs sent me a hot fix and I installed it a month ago
[17:18:29] <Hunterkll> oh wait no
[17:18:38] <Hunterkll> it's my LSI 9400-8i that's 12gbit
[17:18:40] <teh_f4ll3n> Joe-Developer, only have the pre-cooked stage :D https://i.imgur.com/IYNydaE.jpg
[17:18:41] <Hunterkll> the adaptec's 6gbit
[17:18:41] <PublicWiFi> the patch set some settings back to default, including recording retention to 30 fucking days
[17:18:42] <Hunterkll> but
[17:18:45] <Hunterkll> if you're only using SATA disks
[17:18:47] <Hunterkll> 6gbit is fine
[17:18:51] <PublicWiFi> this fuckin server deleted a year's worth of recordings -.-
[17:18:55] <Hunterkll> just don't buy dumb shit like those SAS2008 controllers from ancient history
[17:19:03] <csws> lol
[17:19:06] <Hunterkll> get something with a decent amount of memory & queue depth (like the two i mentioned)
[17:19:09] <haise01> I have SAS2308
[17:19:10] <Hunterkll> i mean
[17:19:17] <Hunterkll> i can sell you some Dell H310's reflashed 
[17:19:18] <Hunterkll> :D
[17:19:24] <Hunterkll> i have a pile of them that i've stopped using
[17:19:25] <Hunterkll> LOL
[17:19:31] <PublicWiFi> now I'm gonna have to shove this up their dev's ass and make him figure out how to merge my backup DB's with my current one lol
[17:19:31] <Oliber> PublicWiFi: about dem backups?
[17:19:31] <csws> PublicWiFi, was this like a dictation thing?
[17:19:38] <sd> 13<C​olour> I think I have an old one from ancient history haha
[17:19:48] <PublicWiFi> cause I just noticed it, so we have a month's worth of recordings that need to be kept

[17:19:56] <haise01> Hunterkll: I have 4 LSI 9217-8i's
[17:20:00] <sd> 13<C​olour> As long as I get 200MB I'm fine
[17:20:05] <haise01> and Dell H710P flashed to IT mode
[17:20:27] <Hunterkll> yea i'm on the adaptec 7805's for cheap shit and 9400-8i's for good shit
[17:20:28] <csws> PublicWiFi, oh I first read "phone recording" like audio recording on a phone lol
[17:20:30] <csws> not recording phone calls
[17:20:34] <PublicWiFi> oh yeah lol
[17:20:36] <Hunterkll> 9400-8i can natively support NVMe storage (tri-mode adapter)
[17:20:40] <Hunterkll> but they're like $200 a pop 
[17:20:42] <PublicWiFi> we reference our recordings SO much lol
[17:20:47] <csws> rip
[17:20:47] <PublicWiFi> I'm livid xD
[17:20:48] <Hunterkll> for at least the lenovo branded ones (Lenovo 430) 
[17:20:49] <PublicWiFi> time for coffee
[17:20:52] <csws> imagine if you were a bank or something and had to keep that shit for years
[17:20:58] <haise01> Hunterkll: nice, I would probably get one but none of my servers have NVMe backplane
[17:21:03] <haise01> LOL
[17:21:14] <Hunterkll> the controller only supports 4 NVMe drives LOL 
[17:21:22] <haise01> oh yea I have Quadro M4000 in my R720 
[17:21:26] <haise01> which is assigned to this VM
[17:21:27] <csws> hey the good news is you won't have any space issues with that server now PublicWiFi 
[17:21:36] <haise01> aka Server 2022 RDS box
[17:21:36] <Hunterkll> nominally you hook up two for like a caching tier and use the other port for regular ssd/hdd storage
[17:21:38] <Oliber> mmm  beetroot
[17:21:41] <Hunterkll> lol
[17:21:50] <Hunterkll> i need to upgrade my licensing server before i do my RDS host
[17:21:50] <Oliber> gonna be a red bowl later
[17:21:54] <Hunterkll> already got my 50-user cal key though 
[17:22:04] <haise01> I didn't use my CAL
[17:22:09] <haise01> cause I am only user 
[17:22:11] <PublicWiFi> csws: LOL
[17:22:19] <PublicWiFi> went from 100Gb to 10 or some shit
[17:22:23] <csws> lol
[17:22:26] <Hunterkll> set up a separate licensing server VM 
[17:22:32] <Hunterkll>  activate the user cal key on that
[17:22:35] <PublicWiFi> christ 
[17:22:36] <Hunterkll> i mean if you're MSDN you have 4 of them 
[17:22:37] <Hunterkll> lol
[17:22:49] <PublicWiFi> last year we had an incident with our old recording software where it just SILENTLY stopped working
[17:22:52] <Hunterkll> and set up an RDS farm properly
[17:22:53] <Hunterkll> :D
[17:22:54] <PublicWiFi> no alerts, nothing
[17:22:55] <Oliber> PublicWiFi: what's your retention limit out of interest?
[17:22:57] <Hunterkll> even if it's just one host lol
[17:22:59] <PublicWiFi> just didn't record anymore, for 3 months

[17:24:16] <haise01> I'd have multiple hosts
[17:24:21] <Hunterkll> only reason i didn't get a better box for my main host is because I already had 192GB ram on hand to re-use LOL
[17:24:24] <csws> multiple big nasties
[17:24:29] <sintax> lol
[17:24:31] <Hunterkll> so just went X9 supermicro to reuse the ram

[17:24:49] <Oliber> PublicWiFi: why? it sounds like you have the data, but the shit company made an error, sounds like only immediate access has been lost
[17:24:57] <haise01> my next boxes are gonna be mix of R240/R440s
[17:24:58] <Hunterkll> upgraded from dual X5650's to dual E5-2697v2's

[17:32:28] <Hunterkll> lol
[17:32:43] <Hunterkll> a bunch are removed right now for another system but that's what's "live" at the moment
[17:32:45] <haise01> that Intel Raid 1 vol is boot lmg ?
[17:32:52] <Hunterkll> the intel raid-1 is two 128gb ssds inside the server chassis
[17:32:53] <Hunterkll> yea
[17:32:55] <csws>         Raid Level : raid10
[17:32:55] <csws>       Raid Devices : 40
[17:33:10] <csws> +4 drives for the cache tier
[17:33:27] <haise01> I have no cache
[17:33:32] <haise01> I have 2 SSDs in RAID 1 for Postgres
[17:33:34] <sintax> gave away a purestorage box that had 2 nvme drives for cache 
[17:33:43] <sintax> but no other ssd's in it. 
[17:33:58] <csws> D:
[17:33:59] <sintax> and gave away a 10gbit cisco switch haha. should have sold that for $1000
[17:34:00] <csws> and you gave it away!
[17:34:03] <sintax> yup
[17:34:11] <sintax> another guy i worked with wanted it. fine....
[17:34:23] <sintax> didn't know it was a 10gbit switch. oops. 
[17:34:52] * sintax makes poor life decisions.
[17:35:02] <csws> I got an N5K C5010 at the $9 reserve one time
[17:35:04] <csws> just madness
[17:35:15] <csws> took a whole weekend to recover the software as whoever decommed it just fried the OS completely

[17:35:42] <sintax> heh
[17:35:42] <csws> way too fucking loud though
[17:35:57] <sintax> yeah that's my complaint. 
[17:36:16] <sintax> maybe depending on what i get i'll just wipe them and sell them and get a big nice server and put quiet fans in it. 
[17:36:31] <sintax> either way whatever new server i get is getting winserver 2022 most likely 
[17:36:35] <sintax> i dunno. see what i end up with. 
[17:37:42] <sd> 05<J​acobC> yea I ordered some quiet fans for my dell switches

[17:38:08] <sintax> @Hunterkll lol 
[17:38:11] <csws> oh the cisco no likie that
[17:38:19] <haise01> Hunterkll: that is the true way lol
[17:38:26] <csws> if the RPMs go down it powers off the switch automatically

[17:38:54] <sd> 05<J​acobC> I really don't want a 48 port switch on my desk lmao
[17:39:00] <csws> I was doing some funky wiring to create a common PWM signal from one fan and insert that into all of the fan signals
[17:39:08] <csws> but then I made a big spaghetti mess and stopped bothering anymore

[17:39:42] <sd> 05<J​acobC> -_-
[17:39:45] <csws> bought a mikrotik fanless 10gbe switch
[17:40:01] <haise01> I have Mikrotik switches in my infra

[17:40:15] <sd> 05<J​acobC> I need something like an 8port SFP+ aggijgrator

[17:40:31] <haise01> sintax: really good switches and routers 
[17:40:36] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> you need one explicitly marked 'multi-gig'
[17:40:37] <haise01> I have couple of CRS switches from them
[17:40:39] <sintax> that's what I thought. 
[17:40:40] <haise01> and RB4011
[17:40:41] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> nah, REALLY good switches are 1/10gig only
[17:40:48] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> multi-gig is a consumer thing, really
[17:40:55] <csws> this one is a CRS so it can dual boot into routeros but it can't do 10gbe throughput so I leave it in swos
[17:40:55] <sintax> i kinda want to upgrade my stuff at home and get the 2gbit down and 1gbit up connection...
[17:40:56] <sd> 05<J​acobC> it shouldn't be
[17:41:01] <csws> CSS models are swos only
[17:41:15] <Hunterkll> sintax: google fiber?
[17:41:20] <haise01> csws: I am running RouterOS v7
[17:41:22] <haise01> beta
[17:41:22] <csws> actually got 3 mikrotiks now
[17:41:25] <haise01> and it does 10 gbit
[17:41:25] <csws> fancy
[17:41:37] <csws> haise01, this model has an underpowered CPU according to people on the internet
[17:41:37] <haise01> by some dark magic
[17:41:38] <nobyk> sintax: wtf even where do you live?
[17:41:40] <csws> lemme get the model
[17:41:41] <haise01> I got it stable so it doesn't crash
[17:41:42] <nobyk> next to a datacenter or something
[17:41:44] <Hunterkll> sintax: because if it's google fiber, you HAVE to use their router to use the 2gig service. period, end of story. do not pass go, do not collect $200 
[17:41:52] <haise01> csws: which one do you have ?
[17:41:55] <csws> haise01, CRS309-1G-8S+
[17:41:58] <Hunterkll> because the fiber terminates directly into the router and it is the GPON terminal - they remove your fiber jack 
[17:42:29] <Hunterkll> you *cannot* use your own router
[17:42:32] <sintax> Hunterkll: local isp
[17:42:34] <Hunterkll> swtich hardware downstream? sure 
[17:42:35] <csws> rough
[17:42:35] <Hunterkll> ah okay
[17:42:45] <Hunterkll> sintax: might still be the same (even same device, just unbranded) 
[17:42:49] <haise01> csws: weird I have same one
[17:42:49] <sintax> with it being a local isp i use my own hardware now for gbit
[17:42:55] <csws> oh maybe it's better now
[17:42:56] <Hunterkll> yea gfiber is the same way
[17:43:00] <AnonymooseReddtr> morning
[17:43:04] <haise01> morning
[17:43:07] <Hunterkll> gig symmetrical you get an ethernet drop and use whatever you want
[17:43:15] <csws> I got this like 2 years ago I think
[17:43:17] <Hunterkll> 2/1 though, you're fiber straight to the device they provide, no ethernet terminal
[17:43:17] <sintax> Hunterkll: possibly but i've ran my own router after their ONT on the side of my house without issue. Doubt they'd have to change much. 
[17:43:28] <csws> and back then people were shitting on its routeros support
[17:43:31] <Hunterkll> the fiber jack being the ONT, sure 
[17:43:41] <Hunterkll> for gfiber for the 2/1 service, you have to use their NATing router
[17:43:45] <haise01> csws: ROS v7 brings a lot of improvements 
[17:43:46] <Hunterkll> it doesn't do any kind of passthrough or anything
[17:43:49] <sintax> yeah the fiber to my house now goes to the ONT and then changes over to a Cat6 ethernet cable I had them use. 
[17:43:52] <csws> haise01, is the UI less autistic?
[17:44:03] <Hunterkll> sintax: yea thats how g fiber is normally 
[17:44:03] <haise01> haise01: dunno, I use terminal through SSH
[17:44:08] <csws> lol
[17:44:09] <csws> jesus
[17:44:10] <Hunterkll> its just the over 1gig speed that gets fucky
[17:44:11] <haise01> csws*
[17:44:12] <sintax> alright. never seen a google fiber update. 
[17:44:18] <sintax> or hardware i mean
[17:44:23] <csws> they've got webfig now for plebs like me
[17:44:28] <haise01> csws: I am used to it and I don't mind it
[17:44:31] <haise01> you also have winbox
[17:44:36] <haise01> which is less autistic then web UI
[17:44:39] <haise01> imo
[17:44:39] <Oliber> i'd assume for the 2gbit service they do that to stop people complaining "i only get gigabit" because most people don't know how to LACP or have >1Gbit NICs in their hardware
[17:44:40] <csws> amazing
[17:44:47] <csws> winbox looks kinda horrifying to me
[17:44:54] <haise01> its just a Windows app
[17:44:58] <csws> lots of menus
[17:45:02] <csws> it is nice though
[17:45:06] <sintax> yeah i'd have to upgrade nic's in pc's and then combine gbit ports on servers to reach 2gbit
[17:45:10] <haise01> not that horrifying when you learn your way around
[17:45:15] <csws> I did build an L3 software router as an experiment and it was ok once you got the hang of it
[17:45:29] <AliceMeows> Are there even NICs for 1Gbit+?
[17:45:39] <haise01> I have PPPoE client adapter, 10 VLANs, firewalling, IPsec, NAT on my RB4011
[17:45:45] <csws> AliceMeows, a lot of x570 boards have a realtek 2.5 Gbps chip
[17:45:55] <csws> mine included
[17:45:56] <AliceMeows> Really? that's news to me

[17:46:31] <csws> but got an x520 in my dell box
[17:46:39] <haise01> I have CX3's on some of my servers
[17:46:42] <haise01> its mash of X520s and CX3s
[17:46:46] <haise01> whatever was cheap
[17:47:12] <csws> CX3 no likie pci-e gen 4
[17:47:16] <haise01> tho CX3 was a bitch to setup cause I didn't realize I had to download drivers from NVIDIA's site
[17:47:17] <csws> I have to go to gen 3 to POST
[17:47:24] <csws> oh wow
[17:47:29] <csws> yeah they bought them out rip
[17:47:41] <haise01> I am running Linux so it was kinda confusing
[17:47:46] <haise01> you have theirs and open drivers

[17:51:11] <Hunterkll> Solaris is a hell of a lot better for windows file serving than Samba is!
[17:51:14] <csws> you should get above 600 MB/s at times due to in memory caching and whatnot

[18:05:41] <Hunterkll> @onenerdyguy these are bog standard PCIe cards meant to go in the PCIe slots of HP rack servers
[18:05:44] <csws> was looking into a bunch of ilos earlier to get inlet ambient temps
[18:05:49] <csws> varied between 10C-18C
[18:05:53] <csws> we have some real weird aircon problems

[18:06:00] <sd> 02<S​ir Sceptalot> I mean, I wouldn't kill myself with the cost if I get a new server and have to leave the card behind, it's like €50 for the 561 and €30 for the 533
[18:06:17] <Hunterkll> the real question is going to be what is on the switch side
[18:06:18] <oxipital> csws: yeah, i guess i am dumb for looking at it
[18:06:21] <Hunterkll> these are both RJ-45 nics 
[18:06:22] <sd> 06<o​nenerdyguy> yep
[18:06:26] <sd> 06<o​nenerdyguy> switchs are the spendy part in this.
[18:06:30] <Hunterkll> if you have SFP+ jacks on the switch side
[18:06:35] <sd> 06<o​nenerdyguy> and I don't honestly see a reason to go  10gb copper
[18:06:38] <Hunterkll> then you'll want SFP+ nics instead of RJ45 and use twinax cables 
[18:06:45] <Hunterkll> for same-rack setup
[18:06:53] <csws> oh god
[18:07:02] <csws> old network guy used to hate twinax
[18:07:06] <csws> woudl use fibre for even tiny runs
[18:07:08] <csws> drove me insane tbh
[18:07:10] <Hunterkll> will be cheaper than going fiber with SFPs on both sides
[18:07:11] <sd> 06<o​nenerdyguy> slap him
[18:07:15] <csws> it is yeah
[18:07:19] <Hunterkll> RJ-45 can be cheaper if you have RJ-45 jacked 10gig switch
[18:07:23] <Hunterkll> only thing is they use more power per port
[18:07:25] <Hunterkll> like 5W vs 2W

[18:31:02] <sd> 13<C​olour> Yeah I am pretty sure I set 2 parity disks
[18:31:07] <Hunterkll> powershell was built on top of .NET and .NET languages 
[18:31:15] <Hunterkll> you can dive from powershell into raw C# 
[18:31:31] <sintax> that's what i thought. wasn't sure if it was C or C++
[18:31:32] <Hunterkll> but to go from C# to powershell you have to invoke like any other command li ne call from an app
[18:31:36] <sd> 13<C​olour> Or did I..
[18:31:40] <csws> neither?
[18:31:46] <sintax> ok cool. i can dig it
[18:31:56] <Hunterkll> you can call .net stuff to call power shell modules etc 
[18:32:11] <sintax> got ya. 
[18:32:15] <Hunterkll> but often times it's easyer just to go system("powershell.exe invoke-fuckoff") or whatnot

[18:32:35] <sintax> i need a invoke-fuckoff cmd
[18:32:54] <csws> tbh real nice you can work with .net shit
[18:33:28] <csws> like for instance I was writing a script to insert IPs into a receive connector and it turns out they're an overload on Contains() which is aware of CIDRs, ranges, etc.
[18:33:30] <csws> made it very fancy
[18:33:42] <csws> since the IPs are an instance of IPAddress() I think
[18:34:19] <oxipital> ^
[18:34:27] <sintax> yeah there's tons to do with PS. I need to learn more about it and get better with it. 
[18:34:40] <sintax> Figured it wouldn't hurt to take some linkedin learning courses on C# to help.

[19:14:11] <Hunterkll> @Colour sure! and remove them too! 
[19:14:20] <Hunterkll> though removing them without adding new disks means you have to dive into powershell
[19:14:21] <Hunterkll> but oh well
[19:14:29] <Hunterkll> so as long as you haven't allocated more than the disks you're removing
[19:14:37] <Hunterkll> you just set the disk state to retired and run repair-virtualdisk 
[19:14:43] <Hunterkll> then remove the drive from the space
[19:14:59] <Hunterkll> can do the same thing in a failure scenario too if you don't have replacement disks
[19:15:03] <Hunterkll> to maintain resiliancy levels
[19:15:16] <Hunterkll> i add, remove, and exchange all the bloody time

[19:17:00] <sd> 13<C​olour> I have a raid6 with 7 disks 7 columns I might make it 8 diskz
[19:20:28] <Hunterkll> it'll still be 7 columns
[19:20:32] <Hunterkll> columns are fixed in place 
[19:20:46] <Hunterkll> you'll have to recreate the storage space to change that
[19:20:47] <sd> 13<C​olour> That's ok
[19:20:53] <sd> 13<C​olour> Or should I do 8 in advance
[19:20:53] <Hunterkll> note: thin provision your shit
[19:20:58] <Hunterkll> you can't
[19:21:00] <Hunterkll> not without 8 disks
[19:21:03] <rpifan> why not
[19:21:04] <sd> 13<C​olour> Huhh
[19:21:15] <Hunterkll> .... where's the 8th column gonna go?
[19:21:16] <sd> 13<C​olour> That's ok I can deal with 7
[19:21:27] <Hunterkll> also, always thin provision your virtual drives
[19:21:47] <sd> 13<C​olour> Whyyy
[19:21:51] <Hunterkll> in case you, for say, whatever reason, want to make a new space in a different config, and move data between the two
[19:21:54] <Hunterkll> if you thick and max it out
[19:21:56] <Hunterkll> and lose a drive
[19:21:57] <Hunterkll> well
[19:22:05] <Hunterkll> you're boned, you can't retire without replacing, you have to replace disk 
[19:22:24] <Hunterkll> thin, you can just run retrim to shrink it down to what data it has inside of it and have a nice day and carry on 
[19:22:39] <Hunterkll> thick does have its place, but don't be like A-KO
[19:22:54] <rpifan> i sorta wish i could get into the accordion
[19:22:58] <Hunterkll> don't get caught in "oh fuck i cant move this data because i fucked myself by maxing out my virtual disk and thick provisioning it"
[19:22:58] <rpifan> but those things are gigantic and expensive
[19:23:00] <PublicWiFi> if i was a NASCAR drive I'd drive the veeam car dude
[19:23:02] <rpifan> the cheapest one is like 500 dollars
[19:23:05] <PublicWiFi> i fucking simp this software
[19:23:08] <rpifan> and im not gonna spend 500 dollars to see if i like it

[19:23:41] <polar> A-KO likes his disks thicc?
[19:24:22] <PublicWiFi> thin drives are best drives
[19:25:12] <sd> 13<C​olour> I see, I think I thick provisioned its too late hahaa
[19:25:26] <sd> 13<C​olour> I better check
[19:25:34] <Hunterkll> well you just made it
[19:25:37] <Hunterkll> you can always delete the VD
[19:25:46] <Hunterkll> note that the storage pool is just the collection of physical disks
[19:25:47] <sd> 13<C​olour> Yeaa
[19:25:52] <Hunterkll> it's the VD you create that maps what is done with the disks
[19:26:06] <Hunterkll> you can have all sorts of types of VDs - mirror, simple, parity, etc - on the same storage pool
[19:26:33] <Hunterkll> so say you have a 3-way mirror and a simple, lose a disk, the simple's gone, (like raid 0), but the 3-way mirror VD is still up
[19:26:38] <Hunterkll> mix and match however you want

[21:59:46] <oxipital> amazing recruiter.
[22:00:25] <TechSmurf> I'm not a particular fan of two weeks notice, tbh
[22:00:59] <TechSmurf> Let's ponder how much notice the "current guy" is going to get
[22:01:03] <oxipital> i dont see why, especially if you have issues with the employer
[22:01:27] <TechSmurf> My guess is about 5 seconds.
[22:02:11] <oxipital> yeah i'm not down with them hiring someone for that either
[22:02:12] <corn266> my boss tries to require a 4 week notice
[22:02:24] <oxipital> theyre pissy that he doesnt want to come on site
[22:02:34] <TechSmurf> Yeah, I mean, if you're peacefully moving on to a better opportunity with no animosity towards your current employer, the more notice the better
[22:02:37] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> 4 weeks is pretty normal for most European companies

[22:11:17] <corn266> Yea. We lock out after they're done the day before if they're high risk
[22:12:17] <A-KO> unfuckingbelievable
[22:12:52] <A-KO> So we're having disk space issues on our Exchange servers--which I've managed with some hyper aggressive log pruning. But the infosec team insisted we maintain more logs on the Exchange servers (I told them we cannot accommodate that)--so a coworker decides to kill my log pruning ; and his answer to the disk space issues?
[22:12:52] <oxipital> yeah
[22:12:59] <A-KO> he went in and fucking deleted "old versions of OWA"
[22:13:03] <A-KO> guess what fucking doesn't work now?
[22:13:07] <oxipital> heh
[22:13:12] <oxipital> he's a winrar
[22:13:18] <A-KO> WHY. THE. FUCK.
[22:13:26] <A-KO> I kept telling folks we *cannot* do what the infosec team asked
[22:13:30] <A-KO> I kept telling people we can't do that shit
[22:13:31] <A-KO> but nope
[22:13:38] <A-KO> LET'S FUCKING DELETE OWA TO MAKE ROOM FOR LOGS, YO
[22:13:42] <A-KO> BECAUSE THAT'S SMUCKING FART
[22:13:56] <oxipital> optimistic view: he's not current on OWA requirements. pessimistic: he's a fucktard and infosec thinks they're james bond
[22:14:06] <A-KO> infosec does think they're james bond
[22:14:17] <A-KO> because they can write python
[22:14:21] <A-KO> makes them james bond
[22:14:31] <oxipital> fuck, if you have some stupid log retention policy pay for the storage to offload it
[22:14:36] <A-KO> NO SHIT
[22:14:38] <oxipital> i went through that setting up greylog
[22:14:39] <A-KO> that's what I kept insisting
[22:14:41] <A-KO> here's the deal
[22:14:46] <A-KO> the infosec team's log system can't keep the logs either
[22:14:50] <A-KO> so they asked us to keep them on Exchange
[22:14:51] <A-KO> I said fuck no
[22:15:03] <oxipital> "collect all the logs!" into this 40TB nimble array with our vms and vdis
[22:15:13] <A-KO> but my boss and coworker were like "oh, no, we should accommodate"
[22:15:22] <A-KO> and I'm like "What do you not understand about these systems don't have the disk space?"
[22:15:29] <A-KO> Nobody's committing to supporting the hardware
[22:15:33] <oxipital> when if you get compromised
[22:15:36] <A-KO> so what the fuck do you want me to do?
[22:15:37] <oxipital> and it happened a month ago
[22:15:46] <oxipital> what the fuck are they going to do?
[22:15:46] <A-KO> they want a year's worth of logs
[22:15:51] <oxipital> collect a stale ip?
[22:15:54] <oxipital> heh, ok
[22:15:58] <oxipital> careful NSA
[22:16:22] <oxipital> infosec is fucking stupid with how they take that shit
[22:16:30] <oxipital> then have some moronic password policy
[22:16:30] <A-KO> My answer always has been: "If you want longer log retention, add the hardware to your logging system. Otherwise leave me alone."
[22:16:46] <A-KO> But they don't like that answer
[22:16:49] <A-KO> TOUGH SHIT IT'S YOUR REQUIREMENT
[22:16:51] <A-KO> GO BUY THE HARDWARE
[22:16:51] <oxipital> you need to be explicit in how one caused the other
[22:17:02] <oxipital> so your coworker gets off the hook
[22:17:25] <oxipital> because he was only doing what he could to satisfy retention policy
[22:17:50] <Activ8> collect these mother fucking logs on the mother fucking hardware
[22:17:51] <oxipital> he fucked up but his ambition was true.
[22:17:54] <A-KO> Granted, the exchange hardware does need to be upgraded. I'm trying to push them to Exchange Online to avoid it. Otherwise, we have to buy an entire new stack of servers, rack them *somewhere*, and then move shit over.
[22:18:14] <A-KO> nobody wants to move to Online, and nobody wants to support the hardware
[22:18:17] <A-KO> and I'm like "fine then?"
[22:18:22] <A-KO> "It limps along as-is."
[22:18:23] <Activ8> some people just don't understand the concept of hardware requirements

[22:19:01] <Activ8> they are, and some don't even have a budget at all
[22:19:05] <A-KO> i.e. rip out one of the OS drives, replace it with a larger drive

[22:49:26] <oxipital> pays 60k, helpdesk job, has awesome benefits like 10% bonus and 8 weeks paternity leave
[22:49:28] <Activ8> did you copy the link for her
[22:49:40] <oxipital> negative
[22:49:41] <TechSmurf> Ran out of space on a production server today (yes, we need better monitoring, hopefully this will highlight that)... production system had a directory with a restored backup of the system from over a year ago taking up 1/3 of the drive.
[22:49:44] <oxipital> i showed her
[22:49:57] <oxipital> then she did it herself on a walkthrough
[22:50:03] <Activ8> I hope you did, then updated the ticket to say "copied the link for the user, then pasted it back".

[23:10:44] <Activ8> oxpital you could just set up the ticket system even on a micro box, works fine
[23:10:56] <Activ8> ours is on a quad core, 16gb micro box
[23:11:12] <Activ8> cost £60 second hand then added a 256gb ssd in it
[23:13:40] <Activ8> SAManage doesn't look too bad

[23:14:31] <Activ8> but that cost could be iliminated by using osticket, 19 per user per month isn't cheap
[23:15:04] <sd> 13<d​avidcochran> oh, they work with ya, that cost is for a new customer with no other Solarwinds Products
[23:15:23] <sd> 13<d​avidcochran> as with everything else, it's a negotiation with SW
[23:15:42] <Activ8> there's a nice theme for osticket and it's responsive but a small cost
[23:15:44] <Activ8> https://osticketawesome.com/
[23:15:53] <Activ8> works great on mobiles and tablets
[23:16:29] <Activ8> never negotiated for anything, our team is very small and we mainly use open source products except rmm

[23:44:44] <oxipital> Activ8: any idea the cost of their vsa?
[23:45:02] <oxipital> i really just want a ticket system with one or two queues
[23:45:04] <oxipital> and thats it
[23:45:20] <oxipital> no need to register users; turn over is high here
[23:48:26] *** Joins: Doffi (~doffi@91.132.197.188)
[23:50:53] <gibby> osticket doesn't need users to register 
[23:51:17] <sd> 06<o​nenerdyguy> osTicket is awesome
[23:51:22] <sd> 06<o​nenerdyguy> or hell, Hesk.
[23:51:41] <oxipital> ill check it out then
[23:51:51] <oxipital> thanks
[23:52:33] <oxipital> id use google forms or something but student data may cross it so it needs to be internal
[23:53:38] <gibby> google forms sounds like the worst possible fucking way to manage anything that would closely resemble a ticketing system
[23:53:50] <Kiernian> LOL
[23:54:16] <oxipital> it takes care of all of the back end 
[23:54:25] <oxipital> which i dont have a lot of control over
[23:55:26] <mistiry> google forms as ticket system
[23:55:28] <mistiry> lmao
[23:55:35] * oxipital shrugs

[23:58:01] <Kiernian> Hey, don't get me wrong, ANY ticketing system is better than NO ticketing system, that's just a new one for me.
[23:58:32] <oxipital> i'm trying to remember where i saw it
[23:58:41] <oxipital> but there's youtube howtos so its not unheard of
