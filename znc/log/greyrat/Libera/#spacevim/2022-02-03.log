[05:10:41] <SpaceVimBot_> <semayog> Show init.toml file (re @purin: hey I just cant get deoplete working
[05:10:41] <SpaceVimBot_> <semayog> all documentation says its out of the box functional but when I write nothing happens
[05:10:42] <SpaceVimBot_> <semayog> if I :chechhealth deoplete appears to be running and healthy but does nothing
[05:10:43] <SpaceVimBot_> <semayog> Am I missing something?)
[05:41:44] <SpaceVimBot_> <purin> http://img.vim-china.org/download/9e96c13e/init.toml
[06:25:53] <SpaceVimBot_> <semayog> Add LSP layer too
[06:58:48] <SpaceVimBot_> <purin> thanks but no good :/
[06:58:49] <SpaceVimBot_> <purin> the same config works inside docker and other PC
[06:58:50] <SpaceVimBot_> <purin> must be something funky with my user or OS
[07:07:28] <SpaceVimBot_> <semayog> check if python is running in terminal
[07:07:56] <SpaceVimBot_> <semayog> check if python is running in terminal
[07:07:58] <SpaceVimBot_> <semayog> is it executable (edited)
[07:09:14] <SpaceVimBot_> <semayog> what printed in
[07:09:14] <SpaceVimBot_> <semayog> :echo g:spacevim_autocomplete_method
[07:10:34] <SpaceVimBot_> <semayog> what is printed in
[07:10:35] <SpaceVimBot_> <semayog> :echo g:spacevim_autocomplete_method (edited)
[07:10:47] <SpaceVimBot_> <purin> :echo has("python3")  -> 1
[07:10:47] <SpaceVimBot_> <purin> python is running ok in terminal (re @semayog: check if python is running in terminal
[07:10:48] <SpaceVimBot_> <purin> is it executable)
[07:12:22] <SpaceVimBot_> <purin> deoplete
[07:12:23] <SpaceVimBot_> <purin> actually  deoplete works if I uninstall spacevim and run my own custom vim.init (re @semayog: what is printed in
[07:12:24] <SpaceVimBot_> <purin> :echo g:spacevim_autocomplete_method)
[07:12:57] <SpaceVimBot_> <semayog> try to use NeoVim. Is it working?
[07:14:25] <SpaceVimBot_> <purin> I only use nvim
[07:16:41] <SpaceVimBot_> <semayog> well...@wsdjeg your turn )))
[07:19:15] <SpaceVimBot_> <purin> it may be best to open a github issue
[07:19:16] <SpaceVimBot_> <purin> with all the :SPDebugg and :checkhealth and stuff
[07:19:38] <SpaceVimBot_> <purin> thanks 4 the help
[07:19:41] <SpaceVimBot_> <Shougo> Well, I cannot support deoplete in SpaeVim...
[07:20:02] <SpaceVimBot_> <Shougo> SpaceVim configuration seems conflict.
[07:37:13] <SpaceVimBot_> <wsdjeg> Switch to insert mode. And run UpdateRemotePlugins
[07:43:29] <SpaceVimBot_> <purin> tried that from the start :/ (re @wsdjeg: Switch to insert mode. And run UpdateRemotePlugins)
[07:50:22] <SpaceVimBot_> <wsdjeg> More debug info is needed. What is the filetype of the current buffer? (re @purin: deoplete
[07:50:23] <SpaceVimBot_> <wsdjeg> actually  deoplete works if I uninstall spacevim and run my own custom vim.init)
[07:51:21] <SpaceVimBot_> <wsdjeg> As I know, deoplete has a log file. Please check the context of the log file.
[07:52:10] <SpaceVimBot_> <wsdjeg> And deoplete also provides deoplete#enable/disable/status functions.
[07:56:12] <SpaceVimBot_> <purin> this log???export NVIM_PYTHON_LOG_FILE=/tmp/log                                                                                           export NVIM_PYTHON_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUGnvimcat /tmp/log_py3_deoplete : http://img.vim-china.org/download/595082f3/log_py3_deoplete

[16:17:17] <SpaceVimBot_> <rachmadaniHaryono> is there recommendation for fuzzy finder layer?
[16:17:18] <SpaceVimBot_> <rachmadaniHaryono> if i want all spacevim feature, it would mean only denite, unite and leaderf
[16:17:19] <SpaceVimBot_> <rachmadaniHaryono> denite and unite have stop their active development
[16:17:20] <SpaceVimBot_> <rachmadaniHaryono> so it mean only leaderf?
[16:17:59] <SpaceVimBot_> <wsdjeg> currently I am using leaderf
[16:19:43] <SpaceVimBot_> <rachmadaniHaryono> what do you use before?
[16:19:43] <SpaceVimBot_> <rachmadaniHaryono> how is it working for you?
[16:21:10] <SpaceVimBot_> <wsdjeg> I use denite before, but now I am using leaderf. leaderf works well for me. and I think denite should also works well.
[16:21:56] <SpaceVimBot_> <wsdjeg> there are too many plugins provide fuzzy searching feature.
[16:22:38] <SpaceVimBot_> <wsdjeg> nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim - Telescope.nvim is a highly extendable fuzzy finder over lists. Built on the latest awesome features from Neovim core. Telescope is centered around modularity, allowing for easy customization.
[16:22:38] <SpaceVimBot_> <wsdjeg> vijaymarupudi/nvim-fzf - A Lua API for using fzf in Neovim (>= 0.5). Allows for full asynchronicity for UI speed and usability.
[16:22:39] <SpaceVimBot_> <wsdjeg> amirrezaask/fuzzy.nvim - Fuzzy.nvim provides a simple mechanism and pipeline to create fuzzy matching in Neovim.
[16:22:40] <SpaceVimBot_> <wsdjeg> camspiers/snap - An extensible fuzzy finder. Similar to Telescope, and optimized for performance, especially when grepping in large codebases.
[16:22:42] <SpaceVimBot_> <wsdjeg> ibhagwan/fzf-lua - The Lua version of fzf.vim, high-performance and fully async, supports nvim-web-devicons, git indicators, LSP, quickfix/location lists and more. Also supports skim as its fzf binary.
[16:22:45] <SpaceVimBot_> <wsdjeg> jvgrootveld/telescope-zoxide - Telescope integration for zoxide, a smart directory picker that tracks your usage.
[16:22:45] <SpaceVimBot_> <wsdjeg> mini.fuzzy - Module of echasnovski/mini.nvim with functions to perform fuzzy matching of one string to others along with fast Telescope sorter.
[16:24:56] <SpaceVimBot_> <rachmadaniHaryono> is it okay to have multiple fuzzy finder layer?
[16:31:36] <SpaceVimBot_> <wsdjeg> no, key binding will be conflict
[16:32:47] <SpaceVimBot_> <wsdjeg> you can create custom layer with multiple fuzzy finder plugin
[16:34:46] <SpaceVimBot_> <rachmadaniHaryono> https://github.com/SpaceVim/SpaceVim/blob/16a5c8caf286097d7754806227a9a7af1817f29a/autoload/SpaceVim/layers/fzf.vim#L51
[16:34:47] <SpaceVimBot_> <rachmadaniHaryono> should this be on documentation?
[16:42:01] <SpaceVimBot_> <wsdjeg> yeah, we should update fzf layer doc, this has been added in `:h SpaceVim-layer-leaderf`
[16:49:19] <SpaceVimBot_> <wsdjeg> `:h SpaceVim-layers-fzf` is added.
[16:57:56] *** Quits: Haudegen (~quassel@178.115.237.87.static.drei.at) (Quit: Bin weg.)
[18:21:36] <SpaceVimBot_> <wsdjeg> a new key binding has been added, `SPC b ctrl-shift-d`, you can kill all buffers match regexp. for example, kill all markdown buffers. press `SPC b ctrl-shift-d`, then insert `md$`
