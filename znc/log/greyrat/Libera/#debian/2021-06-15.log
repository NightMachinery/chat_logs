[00:05:47] <sverzel> I have a funky problem that I wonder if anyone has a clue about. I've a webscraper running from a CRON job which uses Perl, DBI, and some other stuff. I've noticed that if I run that while being logged into IRC, the IRC connection drops with Connection reset by peer. Now this sounds crazy to my ears and I've spent the better part of the weekend to debug this without finding the root cause. I've replaced all ethernet cables and tried w
[00:05:47] <sverzel> ith a different router but been unable to pinpoint the problem. Could there be a limit on TCP connections available to the system or some new feature that got pushed into Debian that I've missed?

[00:24:06] <tremon> my guess would be that your router runs out of NAT table entries

[00:33:41] <tremon> I believe so, yes. the NAT table entry gets created on the SYN/ACK phase and then used for the remainder of the session. if the router drops the entry, a subsequent packet would get denied by the router because it doesn't know about the session any more

[00:42:12] <jhutchins> netstat if it's available.
[00:42:37] <sverzel> DD-WRT is using some strange version of netstat.. doesn't have switch -M.. not sure if it can even list its version in fact

[10:28:12] <yetoo> I'm looking to host a headless debian virtual machine. I want to be able to access the virtual machine from a wireless thin client. Rather than use ssh to access the virtual machine, I would rather have some way that allows a session to be streamed from the virtual machine to the thin client without xserver. So essentially a dumb terminal. Ncompute does what I'm describing, although my only experience with it is with windows rdp rather than command shell.

[11:49:51] <ratrace> velix: systemd also actually works for most people.  "works for most people" is orthogonal to "fails silently".
[11:50:02] <ratrace> it can do both.

[11:53:46] <ratrace> but also, with forwarding to syslog, the journal logs are irrelevant

[11:54:03] <velix> port

[11:55:10] <velix> I want them to be as verbose as possible ;)
[11:56:07] <ratrace> well, things get into the journal and then are forwarded to syslog, aside to being written into journald's own binary database. if the binary database corrupts, that's irrelevant since you've got the syslog files.
[11:56:33] <ratrace> can it happen there's a bug in journald and logs don't get through to syslog? sure, but those are less likely than journald binary db corrupting
[11:56:59] <velix> don't forget the system's cache.
[11:57:05] <velix> filesystem cache.
[11:57:13] <velix> even when it's logged, it might not be written to disk now.
[11:57:29] <velix> maybe forwarded to external syslog or logaggregator
[11:57:34] <ratrace> and that'd be the kernel's silent fault :)

[13:39:37] <shtrb> For context, in order to have control over fan with thinkpad_acpi based fans you need to load the the module with that parameter , without it pwm control will not work

[16:09:13] <PMT> Hey room, apparently there's a certain package in stable which, if you install it, will break your system at least some of the time, to the point of requiring a complete reinstall. There's been an Important bug open about this for over a month. It seems kind of like this should be pointed out to someone if the maintainer isn't going to do anything about it?
[16:09:37] <Haohmaru> they had some android OS before on those, but now it looks like debian 10

[16:45:16] <PMT> #987925 - I am neither the reporter nor the second person who remarked on it happening to them to me (in their case, they wound up with a frankensystem from installing it with systemd broken)
[16:45:38] <PMT> (their system did not start out with systemd broken when they installed it - I realize my language was unclear.)
[16:45:40] <judd> Bug https://bugs.debian.org/987925 in qmail (open): «qmail: Typing "sudo apt install qmail" destroyed my system.»; severity: important; opened: 2021-05-02; last modified: 2021-05-02.
[16:47:02] <ratrace> there seems to be just one message there. is that the right bug#  ?
[16:47:27] <PMT> Yes, the second person did not reply to the bug, they ran into it and mentioned it to me, and we found the existing bug.
[16:48:02] <ratrace> "no internet no gnome" is very vague tho. s/he had to reinstall.... eh? I'd be great if there's more details, did the config get clobbered, did the packages (auto)remove, what...
[16:48:43] <ratrace> like for example, I recently upgraded ma main computer from buster to debian. on boot .... "no internet no GUI".
[16:48:45] <PMT> I can ask my associate to respond, but I think they may have already nuked the (fresh today) install this happened on.
[16:49:17] <ratrace> what happened was that the upgrade re-activated the lightdm.service which I disabled because I use i3-wm from startx from console. the problem was, the new system also came with new amdgpu and I needed to also upgrade the kernel, get new firmwares etc....
[16:49:17] <shtrb> PMT, please ask them to reply to that e-mail address (it will auto add it there)
[16:49:57] <PMT> They were pretty disheartened that the bug has been sitting for over a month with no response, when I tried to get them to reply before; I'll try again.

[16:53:34] <ratrace> the recommendation for more info remains tho
[16:53:50] <ratrace> unless s/he also opted to reinstall and the circumstances of breakage are lost?
[16:54:34] <shtrb> PMT what DE your friend had before installing qnap ?

[16:55:28] <PMT> Let me be less ambiguous. No graphical environment existed.
[16:56:29] <ratrace> wait, what exactly broke then?
[16:57:35] <PMT> A lot of core services no longer start after reboot. They hypothesized that it had attempted to install a different init system and wound up on fire.

[17:02:15] <ratrace> I _really_ wisht that friggin GR resulted with:   "systemd support _mandatory_, other init support optional"

[17:17:14] <shtrb> If you don't own it , how are you allowed to run shred on it?

[19:54:04] <somiaj> |7|: that is a lot of work, but maybe this factoid gives you some idea of what you can do
[19:54:07] <somiaj> !ssb
[19:54:07] <dpkg> First, check for a backport on <debian-backports>.  If unavailable: 1) Add a deb-src line for sid (not a deb line!); ask me about <deb-src sid> 2) enable debian-backports (see <bdo>) 3) apt update; apt install build-essential; apt build-dep packagename 4) apt -b source packagename 5) dpkg -i packagename-ver.deb  To change compilation options, see <package recompile>; for versions newer than sid see <uupdate>.
[19:54:19] *** Joins: LtL (~debian@user/ltl)
[19:54:27] <somiaj> steps (3) -> (4) should work if you have deb-src
[19:55:13] <somiaj> Note just use a deb-src for the release you want to build from, that is more meant for backporting, but the basic idea is the same

[19:56:13] <PMT> I think they may have been asking about making a deb that downloads+compiles+installs at install time, not a new binary build deb.
[19:57:10] <somiaj> I guess to me that sounds liek a source package, and you just need to download it, compile it and install it
[19:58:06] <|7|> Yeah. Pmt has right. I want to install package from source with easiest possible metod for user. Pacake should compile "in proces" 
[19:58:23] <somiaj> I guess you could via postinst scripts make a binary deb that will download/compile source for you, but this is against debian policy, so debian .debs won't do this
[19:58:30] <PMT> |7|: why does a premade binary package not work here?

[20:00:33] <PMT> What are the requirements you must obey here?
[20:00:37] <|7|> Simply install have to be via full compilation process for any binary package used in device. 
[20:00:46] <somiaj> |7|: and providing a script that uses debian build tools to do this won't work?
[20:01:00] <raekuul> probably because you'd have to build the build tools
[20:01:13] <raekuul> it sounds like a misguided security measure
[20:01:24] <|7|> Users who will use it arent developers
[20:01:32] <somiaj> don't see how that changes things, you would have to build them in either case.
[20:01:50] <jhutchins> !dkms
[20:01:50] <dpkg> Dynamic Kernel Module Support (DKMS) is a framework for generating out-of-tree Linux kernel modules.  Packages using DKMS build modules during installation and when updated Linux versions are installed, provided Linux kernel headers are present (these are not installed by dkms).  DKMS-managed modules are installed to /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/updates/dkms/ .  The module build log file is at /var/lib/dkms/$module/$version/build/make.log
[20:01:54] <PMT> This sounds very strongly like a misguided policy.
[20:02:03] <|7|> Simply it would be Best if they can apt install my-src-pacage
[20:02:44] <somiaj> |7|: you could use the postinst scripts to compile/install the software, or jhutchins idea of maybe looking at what dkms does and use hooks that will do this for you
[20:02:58] <|7|> PMT: yeh. But as i said, no choice at all
[20:03:26] <PMT> Sure, I just wanted to state that there seems to be a serious impedance mismatch.
[20:04:41] <|7|> Oh, i will Look at dkms. I forget about it completly
[20:04:52] <|7|> Thx.
[20:05:14] <PMT> ...out of curiosity, how does this policy work for all the premade Debian packages? Do you do a full LFS dance every install?
[20:06:05] <krikom> PMT, I was wondering the same
[20:06:31] <PMT> something something bootstrap something reflections on trusting trust
[20:06:31] <|7|> Nope, it is only for company software. In case of Debian simply i have to use clean, strict distribution without any no free or contrib repo
[20:07:03] <|7|> It would be pain in ass completly to make whole system in that way
[20:07:36] <PMT> Yes, but for reasons you may be able to guess, we don't necessarily have an expectation of that being enough to stop them.
[20:07:46] *** Joins: kieto (~kieto@user/kieto)
[20:07:49] <somiaj> I don't know if the current dkms packages could be used for this, a postinst script might be the way to go

[20:08:29] <somiaj> since you may have to build your own specalized framework/hooks to build the source on install, you could just install the scoure as part of the .deb, then build it with postinst
[20:08:48] <PMT> the uninstall's gonna suck though
[20:09:11] <somiaj> maybe link it with gnu stow or somethign so you can manage the local installs outside of .debs (unless you really want to also build a .deb that gets installed)

[22:07:24] <cub> I have issues logging back in to salsa.debian.org. I have been using my Gitlab account (last authorized 15 June) but after the redirect I get a strange error: "Signing in using your GitLab.com account without a pre-existing GitLab account is not allowed. Create a GitLab account first, and then connect it to your GitLab.com account." Any ideas?
