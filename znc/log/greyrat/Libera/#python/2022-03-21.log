[01:19:46] <ali1234> you have to get the descriptors and parse them. they are effectively a struct declaration

[01:28:23] <zamba> ali1234: well, i'd love to use HID for this, but unfortunately the library you linked to is very undocumented.. so i'm not getting anywhere

When I've worked with them, it's been a frontend interface to which I just "hide" a user input off the viewport that gets focus when it comes time to swipe a card. From there, the values go straight to the card processor.

[03:02:36] <bjs> SnoopJ: well I think the counter argument to that is that they existed for a long time before there was tooling to check them,  and it's pretty clear nobody really used them for that purpose alone

[03:23:05] <bjs> monkeyPlus: if you had something like `d = {tuple0: v0, tuple1: v1, tuple2: v2, etc}` then `max_key = max(d.keys(), key=max)`
[03:23:35] <bjs> monkeyPlus: then you can print(max(max_key), max_key, d[max_key]) to get "3 (1,3,1) 900"
[03:23:39] <monkeyPlus> mm i see
[03:24:04] <blei> condensation is a serious problem for some people
[03:24:06] <monkeyPlus> ok thanks ...can i use that or?
[03:24:12] <bjs> Generally max(..., key=...) is what lets you get the maximum using some other metric
[03:24:16] <cyphase> monkeyPlus, also, as a general principle, even if for some reason a dictionary is inappropriate or unneeded, it would be better to have a list of tuples, where each tuple is (inner_tuple, value), or whatever. basically, the result of list(the_dict_version_of_this.items())
[03:24:18] <bjs> monkeyPlus: what or?
[03:24:30] <monkeyPlus> or you mind?
[03:24:45] <cyphase> instead of a mixed list where you have to keep track of which values go together

[03:57:15] <SnoopJ> acalbaza, install it how?
[03:57:41] <SnoopJ> That kind of thing is usually a sign that you're installing and attempting to import a package in two different environments
[03:57:57] <acalbaza> within the virtual environment, using pip
[03:58:26] <SnoopJ> acalbaza, have you confirmed that the package is installed in the venv with `path/to/venv/bin/python3 -m pip show thepkg` ?

If I comment out the offending python statement in my test code, I get the debug print to my console. Is there a way to make sure it is seen even if my library crashes while the pytest based test code tests that?

[11:55:56] <jinsun__> they will complain a lot about un-annotated functions and methods in strict mode even if coming from other libraries

[14:18:32] <Elliria> Hey there, I'm working with a string as input for a recent_date_time variable that contains a date and a time separated by a space. I parse that string into separate recent_date and recent_time string variables, but am getting unsupported operand types when I try to do math with those strings since they're strings. When I try converting them to ints, I get the "ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10:" error and when I try
[14:18:32] <Elliria> converting them to floats, I get the "ValueError: could not convert string to float:" error. I'm hoping there a way that I can parse the recent_date_time value to give me date and time values in a format that I can do math on. I've got a small snippet of sample code if you'd like to see it and, if so, where would you like me to put it?

[16:00:22] <mav`rik> Xano: However, this is about the _type_, not the instance. Python's development practices generally suggest that an object which mutates an object should return None, so if something returns "type of self" then it likely shouldn't return the same instance it's passed.

[16:03:14] <jinsun__> but why would you care that it is the same object, you just want something of the same type being returned
[16:03:20] <bjs> jinsun__: if it's mutable

[16:04:26] <jinsun__> like to prevent making copies?
[16:04:39] <bjs> jinsun__: no to annotate that "this function returns the thing you gave it"
[16:05:05] <jinsun__> so Self is enough for that I think
[16:05:09] <bjs> but there's no way to do that,  the closest you can get is "this function returns something of the same type as the thing you gave it"
[16:05:40] <bjs> well Self isn't quite the same thing
[16:05:52] <Xano> jinsun__, Because Self doesn't indicate it's the same instance. This is not purely about making the types match up.
[16:06:22] <Xano> jinsun__, Some people care about more expressiveness and some type systems facilitate that
[16:06:48] *** Joins: mfisher (mfisher@shell.themfishers.com)
[16:06:59] <Xano> Daisy chaining, often in builder patterns, are the go-to example for this kind of 'type' expression
[16:06:59] <bjs> but methods that mutate + return self are generally an anti-pattern and so the typing stuff doesn't care too much about trying to capture it
[16:07:11] <jinsun__> okay I'm not seeing the usecase, but then yeah python doesn't have it, you can put that info in the docstring and use Self
[16:07:47] *** Joins: nuclearg1 (~nucleargr@user/nuclearg1)
[16:08:25] <bjs> jinsun__: well the point is, your type system cannot detect the difference between "this function takes an object and returns the same object" and "this function takes an object and returns something that is the same type as that object",  and it matters a lot if the object is mutable

[16:09:19] <bjs> `new = f(old)` if I mutate `old` does `new` change?  there is no way to write a type signature that distinguishes these cases.  But in-general in Python it's an anti-pattern to make `new is old`,  instead in Python functions like this usually return None
[16:09:47] <Xano> bjs, It is often used for getter and setter methods in languages that do not have magic getters and setters, so it's a lot less necessary in Python, that's true
[16:09:48] *** Quits: jpn (~jpn@user/jpn) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[16:10:02] <Xano> bjs, jinsun__ Anyway, thanks for confirming :)
[16:10:54] <jinsun__> yeah that seems like a weird thing to want, normally you want to use the new thing that is rerturned only and just throw away the old one when doing method chaining
[16:11:38] <mav`rik> jinsun__: Xano is suggesting that it's not a "new" thing that's being returned, but as if the method had `return self` at the end of it

[17:18:15] <SnoopJ> exarkun, can you elaborate on what that before/after state is? That sounds like you need some way to signal the state of this coroutine, not sure what the best option would be though.
[17:19:40] <exarkun> The before and after state is arbitrary stuff inside a SQLite3 database.  The test is for a function whose job is to do transaction management - open it for an `async def` and then commit it or roll it back afterwards, as appropriate.

[17:21:13] <cren> is it OK to use `requests` with async/await? A lot of places seem to be pointing me to `grequests` which uses something called Gevent, instead
[17:21:24] *** Quits: nuclearg1 (~nucleargr@user/nuclearg1) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[17:21:32] <exarkun> I'm used to Twisted so I imagined `async_func` would run up to the `await` without me doing anything special - but as I understand it, "coroutines" don't start until explicitly started (as a Task or Future or by a loop, maybe?  I'm not really sure)
[17:21:36] <mav`rik> cren: Better to use something like aiohttp I think
[17:21:42] <sco1> Or httpx
[17:21:47] <mav`rik> sco1: indeed
[17:21:55] *** Quits: crashrep (~crashrep@user/crashrep) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[17:22:17] <cren> Thing is, we're already using requests in a lot of places and I don't want to introduce a new dependency that nobody else but me is using
[17:22:33] <sco1> So change to httpx, which has both sync and async apis
[17:22:39] <exarkun> cren: `requests` just doesn't operate asynchronously, so there's no meaningful way to combine it with async/await.
[17:22:53] <mav`rik> cren: If you're writing async code, then the requests call will be blocking unless you add a threaded await, which just adds awkward complexity

[21:55:56] <ELFrederich> SnoopJ, meaning, I don't care if it's exactly int.  Isn't the new way to use something from abc?

[22:01:50] <hodapp> the integer-like-but-not-int types you're liable to receive are also pretty sparse, I think; numpy's uint/int 8/16/32/64 are all I can think of for that

[23:57:10] <Intelo> deltab what about web?
[23:57:17] <Barones> you are right SnoopJ, I dont have another solution to work on same project on two different machines
[23:57:25] <deltab> sever-side?
[23:57:27] <escherial> hey, this might be an awful question, but is there a way to convert python code into an AST, do some operations on it, then convert it back to source? i just want to remove a few class definitions in a file
[23:57:29] <grym> (in 2002)
[23:57:53] <bomb> Intelo "The Web Was Done by Amateurs"
[23:57:58] <SnoopJ> Barones, if you run `pip freeze > requirements.txt` in one environment, it will create a file that contains all the packages in that environment which you can use to recreate it on another system with the same version of Python.
[23:58:13] <Swayze> https://norvig.com/python-lisp.html
[23:58:17] <Intelo> bomb ya and we have to live with it
[23:58:18] <Swayze> 0.0
[23:58:19] <Barones> I would have to freeze and pip install -r constantly
[23:58:25] <SnoopJ> escherial, there's `ast.unparse` since 3.9
[23:58:46] <Intelo> delarge server side and client side
[23:59:07] <SnoopJ> (it's not guaranteed to be a round-trip in terms of formatting, but it should respect the source's semantics)
