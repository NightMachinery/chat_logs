[00:21:20] <jeffdn> Hey, quick question -- I'm reviewing a PR with a migration that alters the verbose_name on a column that's a foreign key. The generated SQL for this migration drops and recreates the FK, which, considering this migration should be a no-op from a PostgreSQL perspective, is a bit alarming.
[00:22:07] <jeffdn> Is there any way to elide this behavior? We are on Django 2.2, but are about to finish migrating to 3.1 (and 3.2 shortly thereafter) -- do these newer versions correct this behavior?

[00:42:38] <MrGlass> Hello! I am trying to upgrade to Django 3.2 from an existing 3.1 project. We have an existing query that has the order_by '-company__owner__email`. After upgrading to 3.2, I receive an error that this is not a valid choice
[00:45:39] <FunkyBob> yanchai: what's wrong with the actual docs? https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/topics/auth/customizing/#writing-an-authentication-backend
[00:53:26] <yanchai> FunkyBob: whats the difference between modelbackend and basebackend?
[00:53:50] <yanchai> FunkyBob: im still learning :)
[00:54:41] <FunkyBob> basebackend is the base... think of it as the interface definition
[00:54:45] <FunkyBob> modelbackend is an implementation
[00:58:06] <yanchai> FunkyBob: oh thanks. well in the docs doent have an example on how to implement things, so i've been searching for an example for hours until i saw that blog
[00:59:32] <FunkyBob> yanchai: odd... I can see an example right there in the docs
[01:02:03] <yanchai> FunkyBob: is it ok not to use username instead ill save email and password to users table, but then ill use specific column from the profile to use it as username to authenticate?
[01:03:27] <LordKalma> do you have any suggestion on makeing django's runserver exit gracefully on a sigint?
[01:03:43] <yanchai> FunkyBob: like student(profile) teacher(profile) admin(profile)?
[01:03:48] <LordKalma> docker is sending sigint, nothing happens, then docker send sigkill and error 137 happen
[01:03:52] <LordKalma> and I waste 10 seconds of my life
[01:03:54] <yanchai> and use their profile_id instead?

[01:11:12] <yanchai> FunkyBob: the old design from laravel requires a student SN to login in as username that is saved in the student profile. while the employees uses their EN number which is also saved in their employee(profile) to login. apart from that the 3rd user type uses email and password to login. IDK why they want this to be implemented the same way but they asked me to move to django from php
[01:12:16] <yanchai> FunkyBob: if i will create a single users table for auth which is the recommended django way, not all users have sn and en
[01:13:01] <yanchai> FunkyBob: and those EN SN id are the one they use to login depending on their usertype so yeah this is really complicated.
[01:13:42] <yanchai> FunyBob: so i am trying to find ways if i can implement this in django otherwise i will be forced to go back to laravel which i hate :(
[01:14:23] <yanchai> FunkyBob: sorry mate not meant to brag.

[01:38:29] <FunkyBob> is it possible for a StudentID and EmployeeID to be the same?
[01:39:08] <LordKalma> honestly, why not a drop-down menu selecting what category you are
[01:39:14] <LordKalma> and change the login accordingly?
[01:39:49] <FunkyBob> because the auth machinery still needs to know how to look up the user
[01:40:23] <FunkyBob> but ,yes... separate login pages, or a user selected hint
[01:40:34] <LordKalma> with a drop down menu you can use the selected option to know what to use for the auth

I want to have Django store some of this data into the database from those scripts, without using the admin panel. Everytime a user puts a few folder or subfolder into the designated directory, it pushes this to the database. What should I look into for making

[16:52:38] <preston> is a better thing to ask
[16:53:11] <preston> would I just use psychopg2 on its own and make the queries myself, have something like rsync watch the directories for changes or is there a Django way of doing something like that

[16:54:10] <GinFuyou> dam, keyboard gave out as I was typing...
[16:54:19] <GinFuyou> well, yes, django has ORM, as you could have seen in the tutorial
[16:54:54] <GinFuyou> Right, there is a catch you need to call django setup or use a managament command, but that's is it
[16:56:34] <preston> sure, so in the models.py file I could modify these classes and add functions to search those folders and add them to the db?
[16:56:41] <preston> thats an okay thing to do in Django?
[16:57:50] <GinFuyou> eh, why manage.py?
[16:58:09] <GinFuyou> oops. I'm blimf
[16:58:40] <GinFuyou> not sure still what classes you mean in models.py
[16:59:25] <GinFuyou> django is a python. It only requires some initialization to use things like models.

[17:00:48] <preston> So I'm making an image gallery that allows the user to just dump folders into a designated directory and it creates a gallery out of them. in the models.py folder I have relations for the gallery that includes the url, the thumbnail, and the name. What I want to do is have the scripts that scan those directories for the information I'm looking for embed it in the database without using Django Admin (i'll
[17:00:54] <preston> end up creating a shell script to watch the dir probably and trigger the migration i guess?).
[17:01:20] <preston> but I just wanted to make sure I could go into models.py and make changes like that without making Django upset
[17:01:25] <preston> i guess
[17:02:54] <GinFuyou> migration? certainly not
[17:04:09] <GinFuyou> one way is https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/howto/custom-management-commands/#
[17:05:05] <preston> thanks gonna give that a read, I was also looking at this https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/topics/db/queries/#saving-foreignkey-and-manytomanyfield-fields

[18:56:41] <tamere> Is it possible to loop over a queryset to override some data, then filter this edited queryset and then return it ?
[18:57:31] <GinFuyou> Sounds familiar ^_^'
[18:57:43] <tamere> Example:
[18:57:44] <tamere> probe_uuid = self.kwargs["probe_uuid"]
[18:57:44] <tamere> ssh_devices = SSHDevice.objects.all()
[18:57:45] <tamere> ssh_devices_with_fallback = fallback_ssh_devices(ssh_devices)
[18:57:45] <tamere> return ssh_devices_with_fallback.filter(site__probe__uuid=probe_uuid)
[18:58:05] <tamere> GinFuyou LOL I'm back ðŸ˜‚
[18:58:16] <GinFuyou> well, still not possible
[18:58:54] <tamere> Can I create a new queryset with these edited values ? :)
[18:58:55] <GinFuyou> not just like that at least
[18:59:15] <GinFuyou> How about going with our solution instead?
[19:00:05] <GinFuyou> otherwise you'd probably need annotations
[19:01:21] <mad_moses> GinFuyou: thank you
[19:01:30] <tamere> I've tested a lot of solutions but unfortunately any of these works ðŸ¤”
[19:01:51] <tamere> I've tested to use property with setter and getter and to make the fallback in getter
[19:02:20] <GinFuyou> then you did something something, since (without other context) property solution is perfect
[19:02:30] <GinFuyou> *something wrong
[19:03:06] <GinFuyou> Surely it won't work in some cases, e.g. where you can't use model code, but those are details
[19:03:15] <tamere> No but working with properties generate new migrations because I have to rename fied username into _username
[19:03:28] <GinFuyou> nonsense
[19:04:40] <tamere> I rename username into _username and I also used the db_column attribute to use the name username in the database

[22:32:54] <pycode> vlt, no i have another problem, the real problem is that my Quote model is used in many parts of my project and when specific fields change i need to call some tasks (celery) so in other part i could have quote = Quote.objects.get(pk=1)      quote.won_time = timezone.now() quote.save() so in that case i KNOW that i changed the won_time...but the problem is that i need to start the tasks
[22:33:43] <pycode> so the problem is, should i copy the list of tasks in different parts of the project or add that control in a centralized place
[22:33:50] <pycode> in save() method in my cose

[22:35:04] <pycode> idk it is the first time i need to handle the saving of a model instance in different parts of the project so i am looking for a way to call tasks if something happen ("something" = won_time has been set  OR closed_time ... and so on)

[22:37:44] *** ChanServ sets mode: +v EvilDMP
[22:38:58] <pycode> vlt, what can i do?
[22:39:42] <vlt> pycode: An idea: Maybe establish a boundary between view and model code and donâ€™t ever let a view directly change a model property. Have a model method that takes care for that and only call that from anywhere.
[22:40:43] <pycode> vlt, it could be a solution
[22:40:50] <pycode> the problem in that case is when i use a Form
[22:40:54] <pycode> i cannot call that method with form
[22:41:49] <pycode> i also thought to create set_as_closed() set_as_won() methods inside the Model, it is correct and clean...the problem is the form
[22:42:03] <pycode> i cannot call such methods with a CreateView or UpdateView
[22:44:51] <pycode> vlt, or...i should change the valid_form() method
[22:45:06] <pycode> and call set_as_won() "manually"
[22:45:26] <pycode> but in that case i am not working on a saved instance just form_Valid....
[22:45:36] <pycode> yes the saving should go fine...
[22:45:51] <pycode> but i think is better to start the tasks WHEN the instance has been saved
[22:47:39] <carlio> it depends, if you use a form, you can override save() on the form and call the method there
[22:48:08] <pycode> carlio, yes sure but as i wrote it is basically the same as i am doing
[22:48:17] <pycode> carlio, __init__ https://bpa.st/F4PA
[22:48:23] <pycode> save https://bpa.st/FMNQ
[22:49:00] <carlio> no that's not the same, I mean if you have QuoteForm and you call save() on it, you override save() on QuoteForm which calls whatever_central_update_method instead
[22:49:06] <carlio> so it'd be the same as directly changing the model in the view
[22:49:11] <carlio> just an idea

[22:49:47] <pycode> ok
[22:49:58] <pycode> but the save() of the model will be called
[22:50:03] <pycode> always i think
[22:50:32] <pycode> i mean if i call QuoteFOrm.save() it then call Quote.save() internally
[22:50:54] <pycode> so if i move that logic inside Quote.save() i should run that code always
[22:51:34] <pycode> carlio, ^
[22:53:28] <carlio> Llet's wind back a little - you mention that you want to call a celery task - do you mean 'sometask.delay()' and it happens later? I ask because I'm curious to know if the new data must be in the DB when the task runs
[22:53:48] <carlio> In other words, does the task need to know that the DB data is the new data but it used to be X?
[22:54:19] <carlio> just trying to figure out if a pre_save or a post_save signal would help at all but it might not
[22:54:19] <pycode> carlio, yes the tasks must know the data
[22:54:20] <pycode> the new data
[22:54:39] <pycode> for taht reason i created this save https://bpa.st/FMNQ
[22:54:50] <pycode> i save() and then i do the check
[22:55:43] <carlio> try attaching to a pre-save (https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/ref/signals/#pre-save) - I think the `instance` will have old values and new values will be in the `update_fields` and you can put logic there
[22:55:52] <carlio> I'm not sure though but it's a place to look at if you haven't
[22:56:02] <pycode> ok
[22:56:07] <pycode> i give it a try
[22:56:18] <carlio> worth a try, I think it might not help but you never know!
[22:56:31] <pycode> thank you carlio
[22:56:34] <pycode> sure i give it a try
[22:56:40] <pycode> now i have to go (dinner) :)
[22:56:41] <pycode> thank you
[22:56:45] <pycode> see you soon bye
[22:57:38] <pycode> carlio, maybe that signal is set but i do not have the new instance
[22:57:46] <pycode> if i send the task from pre-save
[22:57:56] <pycode> carlio, i should do in post-save maybe
