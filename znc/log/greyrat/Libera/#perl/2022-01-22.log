[00:35:23] *** Joins: Hawker_ (~pi@user/hawker)
[00:35:36] <pragma-> Of course you can rebind the key presses or make aliases to the commands. One killer feature of weechat that I have not seen in any other client is its ability to do "smart filtering", which allows you to dynamically toggle the visibility of certain things such as joins/quits. In most other clients, to stop seeing joins/quits you'd disable them completely. But weechat's filters let you dynamically
[00:35:37] <pragma-> toggle them -- if you want to see any joins/quits you missed, you can toggle the filter and all the join/quits will appear in your channel, even those that have happened already. Then you toggle it again and they're gone again! And even better, while the smart-filter for joins/quits is enabled, a person's join message will be made visible at the appropriate position in your scrollback buffer as soon
[00:35:39] <pragma-> as they speak. It's amazing.
[00:35:45] <simcop2387> LeoNerd: what about a more general "find" like interface that supports scrolling to higlights? i haven't used circle so i don't know it's interface but sort of like / and ? in vim to search forwards and backwards and doing an empty one goes to the next
[00:36:00] <pragma-> I'm not sure I explained that join/quit filter thing very well, but alas. It's worth checking out in person!
[00:36:05] *** Quits: Hawker_ (~pi@user/hawker) (Client Quit)
[00:36:46] <pragma-> Oh, the smart-filter shows join/quit messages only for people who have spoken recently!
[00:37:05] <pragma-> And as soon as they speak, weechat inserts their join message in the appropriate spot in the scrollback.
[00:37:08] <simcop2387> fuck yea i'm shuffling off from work early.  *EVERY* single major problem that has been plaguing my team at $WORK has now been fixed.  *ALL* of them. 
[00:37:41] <simcop2387> a productive last two days
[00:37:49] <pragma-> In the text log, the joins and quits are always present. But they're filtered out from your visible windows! It's great.
[00:39:07] <simcop2387> also i'm liking the "manual" tiling from the UltrawideMonitor keybinding plugin to kde.  I can setup windows in various places with some quick numpad stuff, but still can do crazy manual positioning if i've got a weird case without having to disable or fuck around with it.
[00:39:48] <simcop2387> i can center a window at what would normally be a 16:9 maximized window easily on my 32:9 monitor and put two half windows on either side (that'd be 8:9 each)
[00:40:09] <simcop2387> much more usable than pretending it's two side by side 16:9 monitors
[00:40:26] <simcop2387> and also divide it up into thirds or quarters easily too
[00:40:48] <simcop2387> so documentation in "portrait" on either side of an editor/main focus window is trivial

[01:50:04] <gordonfish> simcop2387: How much are you liking that 32:9 monitor? Is it actually double the physical width of a 16:9 monitor of the same height? The ones I've seen in previous years that claimed to be 32:9 were a little narrower as native resolution was some weird one that was a little less than 32:9, like closer to 29 or 30.
[01:50:36] <gordonfish> (That was some time ago though, so I assume yours actually has a sensible native res.)

[04:45:23] <gordonfish> Damn that's a nice one. Nice thing about those is movies tend to fill most of the screen nicely and things like flight and driving sims can look amazing.

[04:45:55] <simcop2387> yea i haven't tried any flight or driving stuff yet, but the curve + sheer size is nice
[04:46:29] <simcop2387> and i just got the ultra tall arm to put one of my old 27 inch monitors up too, but i don't have it hooked up yet, will do that tomorrow since i have to move the desk and get behind it
[04:47:34] <gordonfish> simcop2387: { Re: kvm } I suspect that is a similar issue with needing dvi dual link over single link
[04:48:30] <simcop2387> sort of yea.  you need full DP 1.4 support to drive it at full resolution (unless you can do compression and drop to 30hz).  my TB dock does it, but the USB-C DP adapters i have for my work laptop only do 1.2, so i have to double up
[04:49:46] <gordonfish> Sounds about right. I like DP overall but they could do a better job at making it clear what the limits for each revision are.
[04:49:51] <simcop2387> that said, i'm about to put in a DP 1.4 MST hub, specifically to see if I can get this all to be one cable to the monitor, *and* get it to be 120hz *and* also have a third output for the old 27 inch monitor
[04:50:06] <simcop2387> but i'm not 100% sure I can succesfully get the 120hz on it
[04:50:35] <simcop2387> at least through the TB dock, could definitely do it with a real gpu with DP outputs
[04:50:48] <simcop2387> but it'll be neat to see 5120x1440 at 120hz :)
[04:57:01] <gordonfish> Yeah was going to say you could always add another graphics card, but since you're using a dock, that limits things (unless you can add another dock.)

[10:27:20] <vanessa> newbie here. I want to use say. but I get this error on my shebang: Can't emulate -E on #! line at cg1.pl line 1.
[10:27:49] <vanessa> my shebang looks like this: #!/bin/env perl -E
[10:27:57] *** Quits: ferz (~ferz@93-39-143-61.ip76.fastwebnet.it) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[10:30:29] <emanuele6> vanessa: you can only pass on argument in a shebang
[10:30:40] <Grinnz> can't do that on a shebang. in a script just do "use feature 'say';" or "use v5.10;"
[10:31:11] <emanuele6> also -E doesn't work like that so it would be wrong even if it worked
[10:31:41] <emanuele6> the shebang is used by the OS to know how to run a program
[10:33:01] <emanuele6> if you try to run cg1.pl (that has a "#!/bin/env perl -E" as a shebang) as an executable, it will be run as if you ran   /bin/env 'perl -E' cg1.pl   in a shell
[10:33:18] <emanuele6> which will probably output 'perl -E' command not found
[10:33:39] <emanuele6> `#!/bin/perl -E' would be a more valid looking shebang
[10:33:49] <vanessa> emanuele6: perldoc says that -E says it enables all optional feature. doesn't this optional feature contain say?
[10:34:04] <emanuele6> but that will still be as running    /bin/perl -E cg1.pl   in a terminal
[10:34:50] <emanuele6> vanessa: yes, but   /bin/perl -E cg1.pl    runs the string "cg1.pl" as perl code, it does not read cg1.pl and run its content as perl code :)
[10:35:16] <vanessa> oh oh I get it now
[10:35:18] <emanuele6> -E is just like -e, but enables optional features
[10:35:40] <emanuele6> vanessa: either way, your shebang also had the problem that shebangs can only have one argument
[10:35:41] <vanessa> so in a script, I have to enable v5.10 can't get away with -E
[10:36:05] <emanuele6> so `/bin/env' is the name of the program and 'perl -E' as a single string is an argument to env
[10:36:52] <emanuele6> and  /bin/env 'perl -E' cg1.pl  will try to call a program named 'perl -E' (perl "space" "dash" E) that probably does not exist
[10:37:19] <emanuele6> you can't use -E to enable optional features, no
[10:37:34] <emanuele6> but anyway, enabling options in a shebang is a bad idea
[10:37:58] <vanessa> how about #!/bin/perl -E ?
[10:38:32] <emanuele6> if it was possible and you did that, those option would only be enabled when you run the script as `./script.pl', and not when you run it as `perl script.pl' hence bad idea
[10:38:48] <emanuele6> vanessa: i explained why that wouldn't work.
[10:39:10] <vanessa> hmm. thank you, emanuele6 
[10:39:29] <emanuele6> <emanuele6 > vanessa: yes, but   /bin/perl -E cg1.pl    runs the string "cg1.pl" as perl code, it does not read cg1.pl and run its content as perl code :)
[10:39:50] <emanuele6> -E is used as   perl -E 'print "hello\n"'
[10:39:59] <emanuele6> not as   perl -E my_script.pl

[12:12:27] <vanessa> seems like perl's regex can do not just regular expressions but context free grammar as well. so I can do a lot things using perls regex and make people wonder why my code works.
[12:15:05] <emanuele6> even sed regexes (basic regular expression) can also do (some) context free grammar
[12:16:01] <vanessa> emanuele6: didn't know that. but I don't know sed. I only know AWK.

[20:48:06] <art1> meant "PPI::Statement::Sub->new('sub newcodesub {}')
