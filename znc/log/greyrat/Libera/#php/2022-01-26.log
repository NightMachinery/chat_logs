[00:00:23] <biberu> can't play that atm, but that sounds odd. why would his code have a) unspecified behavior and b) that is somehow ok to not test?
[00:00:58] <olle> biberu: private functions that are never exposed directly, only indirectly
[00:01:01] <biberu> and you can't reasonably test from the top, the combinations will kill you
[00:01:39] <olle> I think he says you'll get increased flexibility if you test only the scenarios or use-cases describing a feature
[00:01:54] <olle> That will make one slow test suite, tho
[00:02:24] <olle> The point of doing "functional core, imperative shell" is to get that fast test suite of the functional core.
[00:03:01] <Byteflux> If the point is that there's no need to test private functions, then yes I would agree with that.
[00:04:13] <olle> One future problem with enforcing a certain % of test coverage, is that the dev will choose to write tests for code that is easy to test, instead of making high-risk code more testable and write tests there.
[00:04:25] <olle> But we'll see
[00:04:37] <biberu> that can be caught by reviews
[00:05:13] <olle> Maybe
[00:05:17] <olle> Our culture is not there yet
[00:09:32] <biberu> Byteflux: personally i find indirect tests of private functions harder to read and maintain
[00:10:45] <biberu> it's nice to just check for references and find all the tests for a function, and not have to worry about side effects in a test suite when refactoring
[00:12:02] <olle> I leaning more towards making everything public so that it can be tested :(
[00:12:08] <olle> That's a PHP problem
[00:12:11] <olle> Java works differently
[00:14:36] <biberu> also somewhat of an oop / mutability problem
[00:14:41] <__adrian> the reason you "shouldn't need" to test private methods is that they can only be reached by a public method of the same class, which presumably IS tested. i.e., they're implementation details.

[00:15:59] <olle> __adrian: that's one reason, but often encapsulation is the reason

[00:16:20] <biberu> __adrian: i still prefer to be able to find the tests for that detail directly though

I've got this: https://3v4l.org/oA54f which I'm doing so that I can return $this and fluently fetch more data: $obj->fetch("my_input")->get_data(fn($data) { print_r($data); })->fetch("my_other_input")->get_data(fn($data) {
[02:36:40] <varrg> print json_encode($data)); });

[02:37:44] <BadAdviceCat> varrg, how is your $_FILES being populated? O_O
[02:38:04] <varrg> __adrian, yes but my class fetches only the requested input name
[02:38:27] <__adrian> ok...?
[02:38:43] <__adrian> so it represents a single uploaded file?
[02:38:49] <BadAdviceCat> Generally, you shouldn't ever touch/change any $_SUPER_GLOBAL variables to avoid the Action at a Distance problem described here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_at_a_distance_(computer_programming)
[02:39:04] <varrg> use case: $obj->fetch("profile_images")->saveTo("/profiles")->get_data(myResponseClass)->fetch("gallery_images")->saveTo("/gallery")->get_data(myResponseclass)
[02:39:21] <__adrian> ahhh
[02:39:24] <__adrian> no, don't do that
[02:40:06] <__adrian> you might instead have an object that parses _each_ of the expected files in turn, but if the object represents only one file then you should not be "re-using" it.
[02:40:08] <varrg> I could just append to $files for each fetch() and return the array (stop the fluent chain) at get_data()

[02:40:57] <varrg> well, it handles both multiple files and single files, it makes no special code for either

[02:42:01] <varrg> so fetch populates $files from $_FILES and does validation and so. saveTo move_uploaded_files(), and get_data() should give the array (with status code for each file) to the user
[02:42:10] <BadAdviceCat> What I mean to say: loop () { $obj->fetch("profile_images")->saveTo("/profiles"); }
[02:42:14] <varrg> but then I'm trying to find a nice API to not stop the chain
[02:42:26] <__adrian> varrg:  "1 file or collection of many files" is a bad design. "collection of one or more files" makes sense.

[02:43:13] <__adrian> "don't stop the chain" should not be a design consideration. it's an artificial constraint that is pushing you away from a sensible design.

[02:43:47] <__adrian> varrg: your example reads like one object that handles one file. and then you use the same object to handle a different file.
[02:43:47] <BadAdviceCat> You can have a variable inside here: $obj->fetch($variable); in your loop. Now i am beginning to think that I'm living up to my name because I do not have a clear picture of exactly what you are trying to do, and my suggestion may not 100% fit your use case.
[02:43:58] <__adrian> this is not a "collection."
[02:44:29] <varrg> __adrian, each file is contained in a class as well, File, the class I'm referring to keeps an array of File(s)
[02:44:47] <__adrian> a collection would be more like  $files = new Uploads($_FILES); foreach ($files as $file) { $file->saveTo($path); ... }
[02:45:09] <__adrian> k
[02:45:14] <__adrian> your example doesn't look like that
[02:45:21] <varrg> okay, well that's just moving parts of the logic to a third class, it wouldn't change the API
[02:45:38] <__adrian> i only use two classes in my example
[02:45:43] <__adrian> Uploads and Upload
[02:46:04] <varrg> each file needs a custom class, because they need to have a status code
[02:46:19] <__adrian> > custom class  // why?
[02:46:20] <varrg> f.ex a file is "uploaded" even if $_FILES['tmp_name'] is empty
[02:46:27] <varrg> so the user needs to know it failed
[02:46:35] <__adrian> ok?
[02:46:39] <BadAdviceCat> varrg, let's take a step back. Why are there multiple requests?
[02:47:01] <BadAdviceCat> How exactly is 1 request performed?
[02:47:06] <varrg> BadAdviceCat, each fetch() loops $_FILES[$input] and push to $files
[02:47:14] <__adrian> foreach ($files as $file) { if ($file->failed()) { throw new DudeTheUploadFailedException(); } }

[02:47:38] <__adrian> you're trying to do the class's work for it.
[02:47:40] <varrg> __adrian, indeed, so a custom class
[02:48:04] <BadAdviceCat> varrg, what exactly is fetch() doing? Is it performing an HTTP request to a remote server? What is going on here?
[02:48:22] <__adrian> varrg: why would each file need a different class?
[02:48:37] <varrg> BadAdviceCat, reading $_FILES, it's not a request
[02:48:54] <__adrian> do you mean a differnt _object instance_? yes. yes, it absolutely would. and that is the correct design.
[02:48:56] <varrg> __adrian, not different. its own instance
[02:49:02] <__adrian> then yes
[02:49:19] <__adrian> that's _exactly_ what's wrong with your stated design. it re-uses the object instance.
[02:49:21] <varrg> the File class is just a set of readonly properties, with a non-readonly $code
[02:49:32] <__adrian> ok
[02:49:39] <varrg> no. The top class has an array of File
[02:49:51] <__adrian> that's fine (that would be the collection)
[02:50:00] <BadAdviceCat> varrg, what I am trying to ask is, WHERE are the files coming from? I know it is somehow coming from $_FILE.  But what is putting data inside of $_FILE and the origin of this?
[02:50:18] <varrg> so it pushes files to it, then move_uploaded_file and then a third method should give the data to the user (i.e. the method that move_uploaded_files does not hand over the array)
[02:50:30] <varrg> BadAdviceCat, http form
[02:50:33] <varrg> html form*
[02:50:41] <BadAdviceCat> Okay, now we're getting somewhere. :D
[02:50:52] <varrg> sorry, thought it was obvious
[02:51:02] <BadAdviceCat> That is exactly ONE http request.
[02:51:43] <__adrian> $uploads = new Uploads($_FILES); foreach ($uploads as $upload) { if ($upload->failed()) { /*something*/ continue; } $upload->save(); }
[02:52:18] <Blondie101010> that depends on an important business decision
[02:52:19] <varrg> __adrian, I'm trying to make the class very flexible. Example: $obj->fetch("profiles")->saveTo("/profiles")->get_data(myResponseClass)->fetch("gallery")->saveTo("/gallery")->get_data(myOtherResponseClass)
[02:52:27] <__adrian> that's very inflexible
[02:52:32] <Blondie101010> do you want to keep files when something failed?\
[02:52:40] <varrg> Blondie101010, yes
[02:52:48] <varrg> not actual files, but File instances
[02:52:53] <BadAdviceCat> varrg, next. Why not use a COLLECTION instead. Specifically, I am talking about Uploads class being **THE** collection? new Uploads($_FILES);
[02:53:04] <Blondie101010> instances?  does the php script run as a daemon?
[02:53:13] <__adrian> object instances
[02:53:21] <__adrian> *File object instances
[02:53:42] <Blondie101010> not sure what you do with objects that represent a failed file upload
[02:53:44] <varrg> well, normally you'd only check $_FILES for input name that is expected, right?
[02:53:59] <varrg> so saving whatever $_FILES has is not what you'd normally do?
[02:54:08] <__adrian> so add your names
[02:54:17] <varrg> Blondie101010, "my_cute_kitten.jpg failed to upload"
[02:54:32] <__adrian> it's a one-line pseudocode example  ;)
[02:55:15] <varrg> okay, well my code does all that, internally. I'd want a nicer API, f.ex the API shouldn't require a validation test
[02:55:19] <__adrian> $uploads = new Uploads($_FILES, $expected_files)
[02:55:34] <varrg> atm, an options array contain validation methods, like mimetype, image, etc.
[02:55:42] <varrg> so fetch() will do the validation internally
[02:55:49] <__adrian> that doens't change that the _collection_ should not repesent _each item_ in turn.
[02:55:51] <Blondie101010> validate what?
[02:56:17] <Blondie101010> "fetch" means to get something, all it should validate is that the transfer went through or not
[02:56:32] <__adrian> note  foreach ($uploads as $upload)  does not mean that the parsing of the entry in $_FILES can't be lazy, if that's what you want.
[02:56:53] <__adrian> doesn't mean you can't add validation rules for each one.
[02:56:55] <BadAdviceCat> varrg, this doesn't make sense to me. You should have no errors at the point in time you begin to copy and paste files from $_FILES.
[02:57:14] <BadAdviceCat> This is a task that happens AFTER checking for errors.
[02:57:15] <varrg> __adrian, well it doesn't, it represents an array of files, which may be empty or more. It validates all those, and set file codes, then the user calls saveTo("/path") and each file in the array is moved there. Then the user calls get_data() but this is where I'm stuck
[02:57:19] <Blondie101010> BadAdviceCat:  time for your SOLID flood
[02:57:30] <__adrian> it only means that each upload is represented by a single object instance. and not one instance trying to represent all of them.
[02:58:08] <__adrian> "...but this is where I'm stuck"  you're stuck there because it's a _poor design_ and _one object should not represent many things_.
[02:58:27] <__adrian> make one object represent one thing.
[02:58:31] <varrg> so you're saying one object for each $_FILES[$input]?
[02:58:50] <__adrian> Uploads = the collection. yes, each upload would be respresented by a different object.
[02:58:58] <__adrian> (not a different class).
[02:59:00] <varrg> I don't see how the same object can't handle all first-dimension keys of $_FILES, just conditionally
[02:59:12] <varrg> but technically there is only 1 upload
[02:59:26] <__adrian> yes you do. that's why you came here and asked a question.
[02:59:43] <Blondie101010> it's not a matter of capability but a matter of following a proper design which will allow you to easily solve every problem

[03:06:53] <varrg> you mean to have fetch() work as a constructor
[03:06:53] *** Joins: Guest9014 (~vit@chello085216193138.chello.sk)
[03:07:00] <__adrian> no
[03:07:17] <__adrian> it might be a _factory_ (creating a new Upload object), but that's not necessarily true
[03:07:19] <varrg> well, in that example they should behave identically except for what input and what save path
[03:07:21] <Blondie101010> saving lines is not beneficial!
[03:07:24] <__adrian> that's just implementation
[03:07:28] <varrg> i.e validation, rules, renaming scheme etc, is identical
[03:07:32] <__adrian> sure
[03:07:35] <__adrian> one class
[03:07:37] <__adrian> two instances
[03:08:52] <varrg> okay, so App($options), App::fetch($input) : Upload, Upload::validate, Upload::rename Upload::get_data
[03:09:06] <varrg> and App::fetch will hand over $options to each instance it creates

[03:15:50] <BadAdviceCat> varrg, if you want to design good objects, you should follow the S.O.L.I.D design principles. Here is how to: https://dev.to/evrtrabajo/solid-in-php-d8e with examples and pictures that illustrates what good design looks like, and what bad design looks like.

[03:38:45] <varrg> BadAdviceCat, thanks. I will refactor to isolate each form input in its own object, it will clearly fix all my confusions. I also am guilty of such a switch() in that article, I will look into refactoring that as well!

[03:53:02] <znf> Does PHP have something similar to $foo, $bar = $this->returnsArray()
[03:53:31] <BadAdviceCat> znf, that's list(), PHP isn't exactly like Python with tuples.
[03:53:42] <__adrian> https://php.net/list  [$foo, $bar] = $obj->returnsFooBar();
[03:53:47] <BadAdviceCat> https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.list.php
[03:53:59] <znf> ah, thanks
[03:54:53] <znf> side-question, how come the documentation prefers to use $arr = array(); instead of $arr = [ ]; ?
[03:55:51] <__adrian> when it was written, the [] syntax did not exist
[03:56:00] <znf> so purely for legacy reasons, got it :)
[03:56:10] <__adrian> yeah
[03:56:13] <__adrian> consistency
[03:56:30] <__adrian> or maybe laziness
[03:56:50] <znf> it probably makes it easier for new people to understand it, too, I guess?
[03:57:11] <__adrian> the consistency part, probably
[03:57:21] <__adrian> imo [] is clearer in general; array() looks like a function
[03:58:23] <znf> Prgrmmrz b lzy, sv kystrok
[04:03:50] <BadAdviceCat> znf, this can also be done: ['one' => $a, 'two' => $b] = $array; // $array = ['one' => 'number1', 'two' => 'number2'];
[04:04:18] <znf> Too many keystrokes
[04:07:05] <BadAdviceCat> The point is to pluck 2 keys out of an array rather than pluck everything out.
[04:07:39] <BadAdviceCat> Because there may be  also 'three', 'four' and so on. But yeah, it's there in case you need it.
[04:08:51] <BadAdviceCat> I tend to avoid writing code that relies on the specific order of each item in an array.
[04:10:50] <znf> In this case I felt it was easier to list($a, $b) = $this->validate([$a, $b])
[04:11:55] <znf> Hm. Wait. validate can return false

[05:19:56] <znf> or, rather, it won't assign from named keys
[05:20:02] <znf> think that's the correct terminology?
[05:20:18] <Albright> Indexed arrays and associative arrays.
[05:21:46] <znf> which one is which here? https://3v4l.org/DlDpL
[05:28:17] <Albright> That's associative.
[05:28:47] <Albright> but `list($foo, $bar) = array_values($arr);` should work.

[17:10:28] <sudorm> I'd like to output HTML code as text in a <code> </code>
[17:10:31] <sudorm> How to escape this?
[17:10:48] <lembron> htmlspecialchars? htmlenteties? not to much to pick from ;-)
[17:10:56] <sudorm> Example: Here is the code you have to do: code block begins.... <html> ...
[17:11:07] <sudorm> I don't want this <html> to be interpreted as HTML tags
[17:11:10] <sudorm> but just text
[17:11:17] <__adrian> sudorm: https://php.net/htmlspecialchars
[17:11:18] <biberu> that phrasing sounds like you're doing a test
[17:11:20] <sudorm> lembron, oh cool! which one?
[17:17:30] <sudorm> then how to send it back to server?
[17:17:54] <sudorm> example: the user can enter HTML code in a code editor  which is a textarea or contenteditable div
[17:18:36] <sudorm> data = {content: document.getElementById('codeeditor').innerText}; xhr.send("json=" + encodeURIComponent(JSON.stringify(data)));
[17:18:49] <sudorm> I know this is JS but eventually I'd like to get this in PHP

[17:23:26] <sudorm> I want to send with JS XHR to server the HTML code (as text!) from a textarea where a user can insert HTML code
[17:23:37] <sudorm> I don't find how to escape it correctly ;)
[17:24:16] <Naktibalda> you want to get it in $_POST['json']  right?
[17:24:19] <Blondie101010> the server will not have any problem receiving HTML content
[17:24:47] <sudorm> Naktibalda, the thing is for example, if I have newlines in this <div contenteditable>
[17:24:58] <sudorm> then it is sent to server correctly with xhr
[17:25:11] <sudorm> but after a round trip, I lost the newlines etc.

[17:25:56] <sudorm> imagine you're coding a jsfiddle tool yourself, and you want to send to your server the textbox containing the HTML code itself
[17:26:02] <sudorm> (input by the user)
[17:26:06] <sudorm> how do you escape it?

[20:05:22] <varrg> About structuring: I have an App that receives an $options array, it then reads input and creates File objects, collect them in an array and create Upload objects which it gives a copy of $options to. Each Upload object iterates the File array and validates and renames them, either from built in methods (static methods in App) or callbacks (assigned in $options). My question is where the custom rename/validate methods should be declared
[20:05:22] <varrg> (App or Upload, or even File?) and where should files be validated? There's also a constant "FILENAME_DELIM" in App, maybe that should be moved as well?
[20:05:45] <varrg> I simplified the code to this: https://3v4l.org/1WP6l#v8.1.2 (not tested)
[20:07:08] <varrg> I do some initial file validation in App::fetch, and then further validate more specific in Upload::validate
[20:08:26] <varrg> I do that because the initial validation is mostly based on $_FILES["error"] and from there on errors are represented by custom codes in File::code (which I forgot to write, I see now)

[21:48:23] <da_wunder> just because if that is OS project, maybe we could take a look that project and create issues about things that are done badly and even create PR's to fix those
[21:48:30] <da_wunder> that is the whole point of OS
[21:48:38] <goddard> I see what your saying
[21:48:46] <goddard> Ya it isn't.
[21:49:41] <da_wunder> ok, so then you should just say that it's not OS project - that would be enough...
[21:50:11] <goddard> da_wunder: Yes, it would be, but you abbreviated OS so I had no idea what you were saying.
[21:50:24] <da_wunder> OS = Open Source
[21:50:27] <goddard> Didn't know you meant open source.
[21:50:38] <goddard> Yes hence the "I see what you are saying"
[21:51:37] <goddard> it ez 2 misundrstnd peeps wit abrrv. :D
[21:51:42] <da_wunder> and if that is not OS project, then I don't understand "it amazes me how a project can become popular with such a terrible code base"
[21:52:05] <goddard> da_wunder: alright well nice talking with you buddy good luck
[21:56:07] <da_wunder> if you mean that get "popular" inside some company, that is quite common - it might help to start up things fast
[21:57:10] <da_wunder> but if the codebase sucks - that tells me that there isn't real leader to lead that project - and yes there might be issues like "no one has the time to fix things..." and so on
[21:57:55] <da_wunder> and imho those are just bullshit - if you're using that project widely in your company - it should be quite top priority to make that project as shiny as possible
[21:59:23] <da_wunder> also if that code contains `print_r` and specially `var_dump` statements, that tells me that there isn't code review process at all OR that has failed big time
