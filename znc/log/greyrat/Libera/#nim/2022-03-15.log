[03:56:23] <FromDiscord> <Recruit_main707> ah, didnt read correctly
[03:56:58] <FromDiscord> <Recruit_main707> but i think you can then just safely cast it:â†µ`var integer: int16 = round(float).int16`
[03:57:11] <pch> that's not a cast that's a conversion
[03:57:28] <pch> ill do the conversion with reluctance
[03:57:32] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> `cast[int16](myFloat)`
[03:58:00] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Cast in nim is a bit cast which means it does not give a value close to the input
[03:58:22] <FromDiscord> <Recruit_main707> wait that works?
[03:58:31] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Why wouldnt it work?
[03:58:58] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> You might need `cast[ptr int16](myFloat.addr)[]` as i think casting like this can be UB
[03:59:17] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Might be wrong about the UB though
[03:59:59] <FromDiscord> <Recruit_main707> because cast takes the raw bytes, but floats and ints arent represented in the same way afaik
[04:00:38] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Sure but they asked for a cast not a conversion
[04:00:57] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> They said and i quote "that's not a cast that's a conversion" ðŸ˜›

[04:01:44] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Ah
[04:02:43] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> You'd round and manually convert it unless you want to write a `converter toInt16(f: float): int16 = int16 f`
[04:03:09] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Converter is generally to be avoided though, as it causes many headaches
[04:03:20] <FromDiscord> <Recruit_main707> id round it inside the converter

[14:55:51] <FromDiscord> <System64 ~ Flandre Scarlet> and I think float is 32-bits?
[14:55:59] <FromDiscord> <Generic> yes
[14:56:37] <FromDiscord> <Generic> though you can't directly compare the precision to integers
[14:57:03] <FromDiscord> <System64 ~ Flandre Scarlet> So I guess this is why all audio softwares use float?
[14:57:35] <FromDiscord> <Generic> it's also just easier to deal with while getting good precision
[14:57:55] <FromDiscord> <Generic> I mean fix point is still faster because you can just fit more into a simd register
[14:58:19] <FromDiscord> <Generic> but fixpoint can give some headache if you're not familiar with it

[15:24:54] <FromDiscord> <Rika> Journals are quick to write since theyâ€™re append only and then you can merge it into the main file when needed or when possible
