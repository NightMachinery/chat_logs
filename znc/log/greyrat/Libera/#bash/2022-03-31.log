[01:20:59] <jjakob> I split common functions out of my scripts so they usually have ". common.sh" (or similar)

[01:21:44] <Earnestly> I think if you're starting to split functions out of a shell script, you're using the wrong language

[01:25:14] *** Joins: Codaraxis (~Codaraxis@user/codaraxis)
[01:25:26] <Earnestly> I really think it's fundamentally predicated on this core issue I think people have which is treating the shell like a programming language.  I know this sounds odd because it's a universal language (turing complete) but I'm fairly adamant that this distrinction is necessary
[01:26:47] <Earnestly> There's something about thinking in terms of "libraries" and "commands", and how this expresses itself as a programming language's runtime vs. the 'operating system as a language', where files and directories are a legitimate memory model
[01:26:55] <jjakob> yes probably, I do think of it that way, even prefer it for a lot of things over other languages
[01:27:40] <Earnestly> I've found that using independent commands, some more general than others, and using the shell *purely* as a way to compose them, has resulted in not only easier to maintain scripts, but also faster and dramatically less lines of code
[01:28:00] <jjakob> I write a lot of sysadmin automation, backup, devops... scripts, that all share the same common functions
[01:28:20] <Earnestly> Think about how those can be turned into commands instead, especially as filters
[01:28:38] <jjakob> like for logging, whether to log to stderr or also to syslog/logger
[01:28:42] <larryv> fwiw, dot searches PATH if the arg doesn't contain '/'
[01:29:02] <Earnestly> jjakob: Don't write programs that log to anything other than stderr
[01:29:33] <jjakob> right, I might need to install them to PATH eventually
[01:30:01] <Earnestly> jjakob: What larryv might be emphasising is that absolute paths tend to be more robust because it's not depending on PATH

[01:30:23] <Earnestly> (or not necessarily absolute, but same point)
[01:31:04] <jjakob> Earnestly: that sounds like it makes sense, but how do you write a backup script that's executed from cron that saves its log to the system (better via syslog than to a hardcoded file) in addition to mailing stdout/stderr via cron?
[01:31:43] *** Quits: igemnace (~ian@user/igemnace) (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
[01:31:49] <Earnestly> jjakob: I'd use runit's runsv, svlogd and snooze instead of cron.  stderr it captured by svlogd and properly rotated at the same time
[01:31:54] <jjakob> the obvious answer is "have cron also save each run to a file" but can it
[01:32:13] <Earnestly> I just try not to use bad tools
[01:32:24] <Earnestly> But you can use svlogd with anything, it just reads stdin
[01:32:33] *** Quits: ntwk (~ntwk@user/ntwk) (Quit: ntwk)
[01:32:47] <Earnestly> Same with logger infact, it reads stdin just fine, and is the appropriate way to transform stderr into a log of your preference
[01:32:53] <jjakob> I need to look at all of those things I've never heard of before (other than runit)
[01:32:58] <Earnestly> Such as collecting them all into a grafana or whatever
[01:33:56] <Earnestly> jjakob: It's about properly separating responsibility between your commands/services, it is unreasonable to expect each one to implement whatever fotm logging system comes to exist
[01:34:06] <jjakob> you can pipe stdout/stderr into logger?
[01:34:10] <Earnestly> unix has stdin, stdout and stderr.  These fds are open for you and are provided by default
[01:34:15] <Earnestly> jjakob: Yes
[01:34:42] <jjakob> didn't know that
[01:35:04] <Earnestly> I'm currently experimenting with this to use logger to get into journald for services, and it's just: cmd 2>&1 | logger (except with runsv and log/run which pipes ./run into ./log/run)
[01:35:37] <Earnestly> jjakob: All good tools can, when it makes sense, act as a filter.  read stdin, write stdout.  Doesn't it seem amazing that cat < foo > bar works without cat having to implement or understand files at all?

[17:40:37] <bud> i added this to a bunch of my scripts: https://0x0.st/oq3f.txt
[17:40:59] <bud> it redirects stderr to a (log)file.

[17:42:53] <Earnestly> (As an aside, touch(1) is used for updating timestamps.  You can use a bare > to create an empty file if it doesn't exist, and >> file to create an nonextant file but without changing its timestamps if one happens to exist)

[17:44:46] <emanuele6> the output will no longer be in order
[17:44:56] <bud> emanuele6: i actually would like an exception (i think) for --help, to always print to original stderr.
[17:45:16] <Earnestly> bud: I would emphatically suggest that you don't do logging like this from the script.  All tools, without exception, should write diagnostics, warnings, errors, etc. to stderr.  From there a tool like logger(1) or svlogd(1) (or plain redirects) to write to files/journals
[17:46:05] <bud> Earnestly: but it do write to stderr, if the ENVIRONMENT variable BASHBUD_LOG isn't set.
[17:46:34] <emanuele6> e.g. if you have a program that writes "hello" to fd1 that points directly to the terminal and writes "hey" to fd2 that points to tee that write to the terminal and a file, the order in which "hey" and "hello" will be printed in the terminal is arbitrary
[17:46:35] <Earnestly> bud: Yes, the first part is good, the second part should be removed
[17:47:00] <bud> i added this because i didn't want these messages in the journal log. (i am starting lots of these scripts from systemd units).

[17:47:50] <Earnestly> bud: Consider instead this
[17:48:05] <emanuele6> oh, then you can store `exec 3>&2' at the top before redirecting stderr and redirect to >&3 whenever you need to output to the terminal
[17:48:22] <emanuele6> or, in linux, you can use >/dev/tty to always output to the available terminal
[17:48:44] <bud> emanuele6: thanks bud!
[17:48:47] <Earnestly> bud: Have a log function which you define if BASHBUD_LOG is present, so if [[ $BASHBUD_LOG ]]; then log() { printf ... >&2; }; else log() { :; }; fi
[17:49:27] <Earnestly> But generally don't break convention for no reason, its just needless technical debt and surprises

[17:50:40] <Earnestly> bud: Note the runtime redefinition of it
[17:50:58] <bud> this is meant to ease the development of the scripts for my self, i don't expect BASHBUD_LOG to be set by anyone else.

[18:04:55] <Earnestly> It's a shame that systemd has caused this, doing what you want with runit would have been so easy, without burdening you with all these constructions
[18:06:00] <Earnestly> Even the idea of trying to use systemd to manage notifications and triggers from Xorg is so awful
[18:06:34] <bud> it might get fixed. i talked to systemd guys, the ability to make separate journals exist, but not for units started under --user, (which mine are).
[18:06:36] <Earnestly> Mostly because systemd (--user) has no idea about X11 or even DBUS sessions
[18:06:59] <Earnestly> And systemd --user applies to all logins, so you can't even have a different tty with a different DISPLAY

[19:28:55] <bud> sounds like you got all you need. save the output of find to a file. it will be a list of fullpaths to videos.

[19:29:45] <Earnestly> No find is more appropriate here, or a bash globstar
[19:29:59] <bud> in loop body, echo "this is the directory: ${line%/*} for file: $line"
[19:30:43] <bud> and you can use the same regex as in find, to collect the id, just put [a-zA-Z0-9_-]{11} in a group
[19:31:34] <bud> re='*([0-9]{8})([a-zA-Z0-9_-]{11}).*'
[19:31:35] <Earnestly> jensen: With bash you can use globstar with a for loop over videos/** and check each one against regex, using BASH_REMATCH to extract the id and construct the url
[19:31:48] <Earnestly> jensen: Where globstar is recursive
[19:31:51] <bud> [[ $line =~ $re ]] && echo "${BASH_REMATCH[2]}"
[19:32:04] <Earnestly> Note that $re isn't quoted
[19:32:59] <jensen> thanks

[19:37:44] <bud> yes, but it is illegal to explain it.
[19:39:26] <bud> i guess the definition of pirating is to obtain/distribute copies without consent. but sometimes the media is licensed in a way that doesn't make it illegal , even if the pirate doesn't have consent.

[22:19:40] <phogg> in addition to that: if $fixpath could contain any / characters you will need a different s delimiter. You cannot expand variables inside single-quoted strings. You should double quote your expansion of variables.

[22:20:36] <WeedMan> I am a novice linux user and sed is hrd
[22:20:39] <Earnestly> WeedMan: I don't really want to help because the quick solution would have you end up with code injection into sed, and I don't want to help do that
[22:20:50] <phogg> WeedMan: the first character after s is the delimiter. Any character is valid, but / is traditional.
[22:20:59] <geirha> the manual page for GNU sed is rather poor. They hide all the juicy stuff in the info pages
[22:21:20] <phogg> geirha: GNU is always doing stuff like that. Except in the chmod man page, that's pretty good. The hidden stuff isn't too critical.
[22:21:24] <WeedMan> Earnestly: code injection? , I am literally trying to make a script that auto-updates a .m3u playlist
[22:21:25] <Earnestly> I wish sed had a way to express macros/variables
[22:21:57] <Earnestly> WeedMan: Yes, by placing $fixpath in sed, it's code injection as $fixpath is interpreted as sed code, just like sqli

[22:22:16] <WeedMan> phogg: can you tell me what 'delimiter' means?, I have been seeing this a-lot on stackoverflow

[23:07:40] <xmb> sort -n is enuff
[23:08:12] <pyzozord> so you think I should use xclip? is there some easy way to just paste the text in the terminal?
[23:08:13] <userT> I always hated arrays, that's why I was trying to avoid them like pest

[23:08:22] <xmb> or shift-insert
[23:08:37] <pyzozord> no I mean I know how to paste it, but then process it in a loop
[23:08:49] <Soliton> so just paste...
[23:08:57] <xmb> how u want to process it
[23:08:58] <xmb> per line
[23:09:19] <xmb> there are two ways, one is a per element loop, one is a all together into array, and later per element
[23:09:20] <pyzozord> so I got say 10 links in the clipboard, and now I want to run a bash command on each one
[23:09:30] <xmb> well
[23:09:39] <ormaaj> if xclip or similar is available I'd suggest that

[23:09:53] <xmb> the $( will stay open for )
[23:09:57] <Soliton> you understand that what you paste is stdin?
[23:09:58] <pyzozord> no I mean arbitrary bash command
[23:10:06] <userT> Lastly, in general, to parse ls or doing stuff like this, are the 2 main ways: a for loop -like in wooledge parsingls-; and using arrays?
[23:10:08] <pyzozord> yes i do understand I paste in stdin

[23:11:22] <pyzozord> for example, i can ctrl+x+e to open editor for the command, there I can paste the contents of the clipboard and write a loop to process it. How do I write a multiline string and a loop to process it
[23:11:37] <Soliton> what
[23:11:52] <Soliton> you write a loop like in faq 1 and paste. the end.

[23:12:38] <pyzozord> if I just paste the multiline text after the loop it won't work

[23:12:54] <Soliton> did you actually execute the loop?
[23:12:59] <pyzozord> I need to wrap it in "" and I need to add \ at the end of each line. But then it thinks it's a single line
[23:13:16] <Soliton> don't paste as more shell code. paste as input to the loop.
[23:13:32] <xmb> hwrd, there is shopt -s nullglob, when use then no arg will be given, no matched glob
[23:13:44] <pyzozord> how do I do that? faq 1 does not say anything about pasting
[23:14:15] <pyzozord> is that how read works?
[23:14:41] <Soliton> write code as in faq1. press enter. paste. press ctrl-d or whatever.
[23:14:52] <pyzozord> code in faq1 has < "$file" at the end
