[00:52:13] <gordonfish> Anyone have any clue what is going on with that prototype?
[00:55:45] <simcop2387> not i
[00:56:08] <simcop2387> i avoid them because of stuff like this
[00:58:14] <mst> I have very few SAN points left these days and prefer to risk them elsewhere
[01:04:12] <xenu> i think unary prototypes are special cased on purpose but i can't prove it
[01:04:22] <xenu> prototypes are barely documented
[01:06:37] *** Quits: magla (~gelignite@55d4ec6e.access.ecotel.net) (Quit: Stay safe!)
[01:08:19] <gordonfish> xenu: Yeah it looks like it might be that it (single arg being special):
[01:08:20] <gordonfish> sweval: sub foo :prototype($) ($x) { $x, 'def', 'ghi' } [ foo 'abc', 'jkl' ];
[01:08:22] <perlbot> gordonfish: ["abc","def","ghi","jkl"]

[01:08:29] <perlbot> gordonfish: ERROR: Too many arguments for main::foo at (IRC) line 1, near "'jkl' ]" 
[01:09:36] <gordonfish> This was really more of a side quest for want for less parens in a hash construction, but it seems futal at best.
[01:10:25] <gordonfish> And besides, I don't like being restricted to only passing single args and not, say, a list containing the same sort of values.
[01:10:49] <gordonfish> mst, simcop2387: I hear yas.
[01:11:45] <mst> gordonfish: generally what I do is something like:
[01:12:25] <mst> sweval: sub foo ($i, $j, $k, $l, @rest) { "$i:$j" => "$k:$l" } [ foo 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', foo 'E', 'F', 'G', 'H' ]
[01:12:27] <perlbot> mst: ["A:B","C:D"]
[01:12:48] <mst> though you might find the way Type::Tiny uses prototypes interesting as well
[01:15:25] <gordonfish> Nice, though you haven't do anything with @rest so the next call is effectively lost.

[03:05:34] <simcop2387> daemon: jails don't provide the same stuff, you'd also need pledge and capcasin(i think thats the name) too.  it'd be a bit involved.  doable though.  that was one reason i made the evalserver a separate project with a defined protocol so it'd be possible.  that said i need to update the protocol to not use protobufs or see if my pain point with newer lib versions is fixed
[03:06:32] <daemon> simcop2387, well because it was involved is why I thought it might be fun to do it on a live stream
[03:06:43] <daemon> to watch out mental anguish be realised :)
[03:06:47] <daemon> s/out/our/
[03:07:00] <simcop2387> i need to add data streams (live std{err,out,in} and other files) and some socket support for userspace tcp
[03:08:19] <daemon> simcop2387, I have a BSD dedi say doing not much ready ... can push it to 13.x in a second and grab bhyve etc :D 
[03:09:04] <simcop2387> daemon: might be fun to do at some point.  i'd basically start it from scratch
[03:09:20] <simcop2387> first parts would be libraries to enable it all
[03:09:41] <daemon> simcop2387, even better we could do it as a joint BSD and perl tutorial, it won't be very good but eh it would be something modern
[03:09:54] <daemon> I could get us a server to do it on

[03:15:46] <daemon> it would take a lot of time

[08:41:00] <VVelox> So been beating my head against the wall on this. But I am creating a base module, how do I enable the base module to call a method which exists in the module that is using it as a base?
[08:42:05] <rindolf> VVelox: do you mean a parent class?
[08:42:45] <rindolf> $self->mymethod(...); should work

[08:44:11] <VVelox> rindolf:  So lets say There is Foo::Base and Foo::Bar uses Foo::Base as base method. Foo::Base->get_files calls Foo::Bar->get_files_module... but that results in the error of Foo::Base->get_files_module as not existing
[08:44:39] *** Joins: mattil (~mattil@helsinki.portalify.com)
[08:44:53] <Grinnz> it sounds like eitehr 1) your base module should provide a stub method which dies if there isn't a subclass that implements/overrides it (abstract base), or 2) your base module should actually be a role, and "requires 'somemethod';", see Role::Tiny
[08:45:05] *** Joins: diskin (~diskin@ec2-18-158-88-195.eu-central-1.compute.amazonaws.com)
[08:45:31] <Grinnz> i think your design is confused. these methods should be called on objects of the subclass, not specific classes
[08:45:59] <Grinnz> if you don't have objects, you shouldn't be using inheritance for it
[08:47:19] *** Quits: diskin (~diskin@ec2-18-158-88-195.eu-central-1.compute.amazonaws.com) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[08:47:25] <Grinnz> the way object orientation works is that you make an object of a class, and call methods on that object - it may find methods in its class or in its parent classes, but it will always pass the same object to them
[08:48:07] <Grinnz> thus you never rely on the object being a specific class, just that it will choose methods based on its class
[08:48:32] <VVelox> hmm...
[08:48:42] *** Joins: diskin (~diskin@46.41.64.76)
[08:48:59] <VVelox> actually better question do things go side ways if new is in the parent?
[08:49:20] <Grinnz> no, new can be inherited fine, but the key is your constructor needs to bless to the class that was used to call new
[08:49:27] <Grinnz> that's why it gets the class as the first arg
[08:50:03] <Grinnz> (there's also a reason Moo and similar object ecosystems exist, so you don't have to reinvent constructors and attribute methods)
[08:52:37] <Grinnz> basically, if you're ever using a specific package name in an object oriented module, you are probably doing something wrong
[08:52:49] <Grinnz> to call methods, that is
[08:57:09] <VVelox> Just changed to to use moose and seeing the exact same thing
[08:57:52] <Grinnz> you're going to have to show some code
[08:59:15] <VVelox> https://github.com/VVelox/Server-Toaster/blob/main/lib/Server/Toaster/Modules/Apache.pm  get_files_module contains a list of templates used and is called by get_files in https://github.com/VVelox/Server-Toaster/blob/main/lib/Server/Toaster/Modules/Base.pm

[08:59:49] <Grinnz> you can't slap "use Moose" into a module that already has a sub new
[09:00:05] *** Quits: deadmarshal (~deadmarsh@95.38.114.152) (Ping timeout: 250 seconds)
[09:00:44] <Grinnz> Moose lets you avoid writing constructors and accessors, it's not compatible with existing ones
[09:01:26] <Grinnz> anyway, the problem in your constructor: "bless $self;"
[09:01:43] <Grinnz> you need to bless that to the invocant (the first argument the sub receives)
[09:02:04] <Grinnz> normally named $class by convention
[09:02:34] <Grinnz> omitting the class means it blesses to __PACKAGE__, which is never correct
[09:05:04] <Grinnz> but make sure you remove Moose from your modules unless you plan on replacing that constructor with Moose attributes
[09:05:19] <VVelox> yup, done that and 
[09:08:05] <VVelox> Grinnz: Awesome, it worked! Thanks.
[09:08:13] <Grinnz> then you can put in your base class since effectively it's an abstract base class: sub get_files_module { ... }
[09:08:25] <Grinnz> literal ..., which will die with "Unimplemented" at runtime
[09:09:29] <Grinnz> or ideally, croak from Carp which will tell you what tried to call the method on the abstract base class
