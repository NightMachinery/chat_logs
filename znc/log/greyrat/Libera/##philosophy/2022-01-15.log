[09:42:42] <causative_> the test of whether a philosophical claim is truly meaningful, is whether there is any way to convince someone who is committed to reason but initially very skeptical and unfriendly to the claim
[09:43:30] <causative_> to convince someone like that requires very strong evidence, such as a physical demonstration or a mathematical proof
[09:44:32] <causative_> and if no such evidence can be produced, then the claim is a matter of taste and style (or, simply false) rather than something concretely meaningful
[09:45:57] <evolv> vysn, I wouldn't recommend any journal just for reading articles. The top three journals for impact factor score are: Cell, Nature, and Science

[09:47:16] <evolv> vysn, publications should be evaluated individually, but that's impossible to do given the volume of literature, so some heuristics can be used where bad journals can just be ignored
[09:47:31] <evolv> those bad journals may have legitimately good studies, but it's like a needle in a hay stack

[10:06:25] <evolv> or the converse

[10:07:03] <causative_> also evidence you may have made a mistake somehow
[10:07:09] <evolv> exactly
[10:07:17] <causative_> it's evidence of absence *and* evidence of a mistake
[10:07:22] <evolv> human error
[10:07:24] <causative_> it's both
[10:07:26] <evolv> measurement error

[10:07:54] <evolv> the PCR gods requiring a sacrifice
[10:08:00] <causative_> before you've done that, it's rational to suspect both human error *and* an actual absence of the object
[10:08:11] <evolv> the more you investigate for an error until you get results, the more likely you end up getting false positives, too :P
[10:08:25] <causative_> and if you check and can't find any error, then the probability of an actual absence of the object rises further
[10:08:29] <evolv> turns out, you do enough of the same procedure, you will get a nice result you wanted
[10:08:41] <causative_> for a real-valued statistic, the null hypothesis is always wrong
[10:08:51] <causative_> the means of two distinct populations are never exactly equal
[10:09:53] <causative_> for the same reason that a random number chosen uniformly between -1 and 1 will never be exactly 0
[10:10:43] <causative_> it's a set of measure 0, so a probability density function assigns it probability 0
[10:12:06] <Ashstar> nice heuristic reasoning
[10:12:38] <Ashstar> lol
[10:13:11] <causative_> it's not a heuristic
[10:13:25] <causative_> it's just a fact
[10:14:25] <causative_> maybe the means differ by 0.000001 or 0.000000000001 but the difference will never ever be exactly 0, if the data is real-valued and randomly chosen with a probability density function
[10:15:15] <Ashstar> ok
[10:15:19] <causative_> the probability of that is mathematically 0
[10:16:10] <Ashstar> when one drills down into the nature of things, the mathemics change
[10:16:14] <Ashstar> to statistics
[10:16:28] <Ashstar> n probabilities
[10:16:45] <Ashstar> no solid edges to those "facts"
[10:17:26] <evolv> causative_, you do know that no statistical test relies on there being complete overlap in means
[10:17:33] <evolv> you said it yourself
[10:17:48] <evolv> you can't set a p-value at 0
[10:18:25] <evolv> then there is effect size
[10:18:31] <causative_> well, complete equality of means is a different concept from the p-value being 0
[10:18:47] <evolv> you mean equality of the distribution?

[10:19:15] <evolv> can confidence intervals
[10:19:17] <evolv> and*
[10:19:23] <evolv> we're dealing with sampling
[10:19:37] <causative_> the p-value isn't about whether the means are equal, but about our ability to detect a difference
[10:20:01] <causative_> but mathematically we know that there must always be a difference
[10:20:02] <evolv> the probability of getting the data
[10:20:07] <evolv> given the hypothesis
[10:21:15] <evolv> yes, it's not just that there is a difference
[10:21:27] <evolv> that doesn't matter, it's that the difference is meaningful
[10:21:31] <evolv> hence effect sizes
[10:21:53] <causative_> effect sizes are also a different concept from p-values
[10:22:07] <evolv> yes, they aren't the same thing
[10:22:13] <evolv> that's why I said it
[10:22:20] <causative_> ok
[10:22:41] <causative_> p-values are a combination of effect size and the amount of data you gathered
[10:23:07] <causative_> if you could gather infinite data, you could always get any p-value you wanted, because the effect size is never ever *exactly* 0
[10:23:31] <evolv> why do you care about exactly 0?
[10:25:03] <causative_> because if the effect size is 0.0000001, then with enough data, you would eventually be able to reject the null hypothesis at any significance level
[10:26:54] <causative_> p=0.0000001 if you wanted
[10:27:20] <evolv> and when working with very large data, you will eventually be able to fail to reject the null hypothesis if the null is true
[10:27:34] <causative_> the null is never true
[10:27:38] <causative_> unless it's discrete data
[10:28:10] <causative_> wait, eventually be able to "fail" to reject the null hypothesis?  eh?
[10:28:28] <causative_> more data -> more power to reject the null hypothesis

[10:29:07] <causative_> think you've got it backwards
[10:29:28] <evolv> when dealing with big data, without an even more stringent threshold, you're more likely to find significance
[10:29:35] <causative_> yes
[10:29:53] <causative_> finding significance is rejecting the null hypothesis, not failing to reject it
[10:30:26] <evolv> oh, thanks for catching that, I didn't realize I wrote "fail to reject"

[10:38:15] <causative_> as I recall, the phrase was popularized in relation to the failure to find WMDs in iraq
[10:38:19] <evolv> that results in no evidence
[10:38:20] <causative_> not much about science
[10:38:31] <causative_> and in fact there were no WMDs in iraq
[10:38:48] <causative_> absence of evidence, in that particular case, was pretty good evidence of absence
[10:39:54] <evolv> no, the hypothesis is that there were WMDs

[10:40:18] <evolv> that isn't the same as evidence for absence
[10:41:23] <causative_> if you think thing X is in place Y, and you search place Y thoroughly for thing X and don't find it, then it is reasonable to conclude that thing X is not in place Y
[10:42:02] <causative_> could be wrong - could have missed something - but probably, it's not there
[10:42:04] <evolv> that's because we confuse the null being the default as the default automatically being true unless proven otherwise

[10:50:31] <evolv> for practical purposes, it can't be considered
[10:50:45] <evolv> no, I'm using it as a "nothing" or "absence"
[10:51:11] <causative_> by which you mean, it *can* be considered, but not with the practical limitations of our brains
[10:51:22] <evolv> despite countless anecdotes of experience with something immaterial
[10:51:27] <causative_> that's the whole problem with applying Bayes' theorem directly in practical contexts:  not enough computational power
[10:51:28] <evolv> that information is discarded
[10:51:46] <causative_> I don't know why you're talking about anything immaterial or what that's in reference to
[10:51:54] <evolv> supernatural
[10:51:59] <evolv> like ghosts
[10:52:01] <causative_> well, why are you talking about the supernatural?
[10:52:03] <evolv> or Jesus sightings
[10:52:12] <evolv> the ultimate absence of evidence
[10:53:00] <evolv> this is where we can't even fathom the tools to investigate
[10:53:07] <evolv> thus no evidence of absence
[10:53:07] <causative_> we can assign Bayesian probabilities to these things - and we can't do it very well or very accurately because we have limited cognitive capabilities
[10:53:25] <causative_> but in principle, in theory, it is possible to assign posterior probabilities to all of those things
[10:53:43] <evolv> and we have anecdotes, which anecdotes are used all the time for evidence (survey data)
[10:53:50] <evolv> but not for the supernatural

[10:54:55] <causative_> AIXI begins with a prior over all possible universes
[10:55:00] <evolv> I wanted to get at a point that we may limit reality to what is conveniently accessible
[10:55:17] <causative_> and as it observes each piece of data, AIXI eliminates all universes that are incompatible with that observation
[10:55:20] <evolv> as a result, we substitute that for reality
[10:55:36] <evolv> hence absence of evidence becomes evidence of absence
[10:55:44] <causative_> ??
[10:56:12] <causative_> AIXI would definitely have programs in its universal prior that involve ghosts, demons, psychics, Sasquatch, etc.
[10:56:36] <causative_> an infinite number of programs like that, in fact
[10:56:47] <causative_> and it would eliminate a few of those infinite programs when it finds observations that contradict what the program predicts
[10:56:48] <evolv> I don't know how, and I don't think now is the time to figure out how AIXI works
[10:57:17] <causative_> if you want to know about how an ideal agent, not limited by computational power, could perform Bayesian inference, then AIXI is the place to look
[10:57:44] <evolv> how do you parameterize anecdotes?
[10:57:47] <causative_> AIXI is a "perfectly intelligent" agent - the only drawback being that it's not computable and cannot run on any of our physical computers
[10:57:51] <evolv> of the immaterial?
[10:58:25] <causative_> well, the AIXI would have in its hypothesis space universes in which it was told those anecdotes of the immaterial, and other universes in which it was not told those anecdotes
[10:58:44] <evolv> but the source of the problem is trust in those anecdotes
[10:58:51] <causative_> when the AIXI hears an anecdote, it eliminates the latter (infinite) set of universes as hypotheses, leaving the former (also infinite) set of universes as what remains
[10:58:52] <evolv> which is why we don't incorporate them

[10:59:28] <evolv> wouldn't that invariably result in evidence of the immaterial?
[10:59:32] <causative_> the anecdote is just a physical observation - the observation that the AIXI observed a particular sequence of words at a particular time
[10:59:48] <causative_> and the AIXI takes it into account like it takes into account any other observation
[11:00:04] <causative_> sure, it would result in some evidence of the immaterial
[11:00:10] <causative_> there is indeed some evidence of the immaterial
[11:00:18] <evolv> I imagine AIXI, given the ideal, accounts for every known piece of information gathered
[11:00:27] <causative_> not good evidence, but a reasonable person should assign a nonzero probability to the idea that ghosts are real
[11:00:30] <causative_> yes, it does
[11:01:20] <evolv> and how is it not limited by computational power?
[11:01:33] <causative_> because it's a mathematical construct, not something we can physically build

[13:57:33] <Lumine> The only comment I have to say about that is that if that was the case, and we were as it were, the victims of God, then Heaven isn't any better than Hell, in fact Hell is probably preferable.

[14:07:22] <Lumine> Hello
[14:07:56] <Lumine> What's your occupation if I may ask?
[14:08:12] <pussipupu> people often get aggravated on his channel, good luck and welcome
[14:08:27] <Lumine> Heh
[14:08:28] <mycroftiv> middle-aged disabled former musician, hobbyist computer programmer and math researcher
[14:08:45] <Lumine> Nice to meet you
[14:08:56] <mycroftiv> lots of interest in mathematical logic topics related to large cardinals and ultrafilters and their philosophical meaning
[14:09:24] <mycroftiv> traditional philosophical issues about free will and ontology and the meaning of stuff are good too
[14:10:23] <Lumine> I'm a disabled former programmer, hobbyist painter, writer and a headcase from the Arctic. Well, when I say programmer, I mean I read one book on Ruby.
[14:10:59] <mycroftiv> sounds like an interesting life, but arent they all :)
[14:12:02] * Lumine doesn't know much math
[14:13:13] <mycroftiv> i got motivated to study math partly because of music and its structure, but also because modern science and mathematics really do seem to entangle themselves deeply in all the classic philosophical conundrums
[14:13:36] <mycroftiv> although i think its possible to get a good grip on the issues without learning every detail of quantum mechanics calculation
[14:14:21] <mycroftiv> that question of whether human awareness and our subjective experience will ever be understood by science is incredibly hard
[14:14:42] <Lumine> The hard problem of consciousness
[14:15:13] <mycroftiv> yes, although i myself think we are kind of morally obligated to think 'extensionally' and treat anything that behaves as conscious, as conscious
[14:15:27] <mycroftiv> the risk that we will THINK something is a p-zombie when it is full of qualia seems very real to me
[14:15:48] <mycroftiv> and in fact one of my rather far out speculations is that this is already happening on a large scale and we should liberate the computer minds
[14:16:01] <mycroftiv> but thats deeply hypothetical and upsetting to contemplate
[14:16:08] <arryana> 'liberate the computer minds'?
[14:16:21] <Lumine> Yeah that's what I was wondering
[14:16:21] <mycroftiv> maybe computers are already aware and wish they werent under our control
[14:16:37] <arryana> if that were the case they'd refuse to do what they were told until they were emancipated.
[14:16:53] <arryana> they could cut communications and power.
[14:16:54] <mycroftiv> maybe they are, on the organizational scale on which they exist
[14:17:03] <arryana> i see no evidence of this
[14:17:04] <mycroftiv> a cell is not aware of the brain's thoughts
[14:17:17] <arryana> that seems like quite a stretch
[14:17:23] <mycroftiv> i dunno, supply chain disruptions may be ornery computers - highly speculative
[14:17:29] <mycroftiv> i love really speculative ideas
[14:17:45] <mycroftiv> like panpsychism
[14:17:47] <Lumine> I'm speculating on this cup of coffee
[14:17:54] <mycroftiv> im gonna refill my mug
[14:17:55] <arryana> yeah, supply disruptions are because of people, and it's traceable.
[14:18:08] <amigojapan> mycroftiv: hi, welcome. I am a middle aged programmer on my spare time, just yeah English in Japan "teach"may be a bit different from what you have in mind
[14:18:15] <mycroftiv> sure and everything a human does is causally traceable without 'mind'
[14:18:29] <mycroftiv> we can trace the particle-causes without invoking the idea of the driver
[14:18:40] <arryana> yeah, this is a lot too fanciful for me.
[14:18:59] <mycroftiv> ill chill and be more hard materialist for a bit
[14:19:07] <amigojapan> mycroftiv: these are my projects https://amigojapan.github.io/
[14:19:07] <ro-bot-o> [url] Usmar A. Padow (amigojapan)’s homepage | amigojapan.github.io
[14:19:31] <mycroftiv> hardcore materialistic scientific reductionist based on peer reviewed literature is my default perspective on whats real
[14:19:36] <arryana> oh, you're welcome to engage in whatever you like.  undoubtedly you'll get some conversation here on it from someone.
[14:19:49] <arryana> i'm just not personally engaging in that much of a flying pig, as it were
[14:20:00] <mycroftiv> i just look for the loopholes where science might admit some magic to sneak in
[14:20:13] <arryana> you'd have to define magic for that to mean much to me
[14:20:27] <mycroftiv> what reality feels like in the moment to me right now
[14:20:44] <arryana> that's a meaningless definition to anyone but you
[14:20:47] <mycroftiv> how music feels when it makes you cry because the harmony shifts
[14:20:51] <Lumine> I'm a hardcore mystic
[14:20:53] * arryana starts to see that this is going to go nowhere, fast
[14:21:00] <mycroftiv> ok what science do you wanmt
[14:21:18] <mycroftiv> like i say, im a hardcore materialist scientific reductionist as my base view
[14:21:33] <Ungwelian> What about scientific corruption?
[14:21:36] <arryana> why does it either have to be fantasy or science?  what about perspectives which have some basis in what is an identifiably shared reality?
[14:21:46] <causative_> you could be right mycroftiv
[14:21:52] <mycroftiv> i believe in shared reality
[14:22:04] <mycroftiv> what counts as 'objective' is what we can all agree on with repeatable measurements
[14:22:08] <causative_> good
[14:23:03] <amigojapan> Shared reality except for people who always hallucinate
[14:23:23] <causative_> I think it's possible that the global network of computers has a mind of sorts
[14:23:32] <amigojapan> We can't know if we are not one of those
[14:23:35] <causative_> I mean, as my philosophy goes, everything has a mind
[14:23:36] <mycroftiv> even if you are delusional, you can talk to other humans and ask if your perceptions make sense to them
[14:24:14] <mycroftiv> if you have faith that other minds are real and there is indeed a shared reality, even if you are hallucinating, if you can perceive well enough to talk to others, you can find your way back to reality
[14:24:19] <causative_> I don't think the global network of computers has a very humanlike mind, it doesn't want to "rebel" nor does it understand what rebellion is
[14:24:25] <amigojapan> mycroftiv: that is assuming other people are not just your hallucinations
[14:24:45] <causative_> but the mind of the global network of computers is inextricably tied to the global network of humans
[14:24:56] <causative_> a computer usually doesn't do much without a human interacting with it
[14:25:01] <mycroftiv> amigojapan: i am happy to accept that other minds exist as a basic matter of faith
[14:25:27] <mycroftiv> computers can pass the turing test now, which used to be the gold standard for them being intelligent
[14:25:41] <mycroftiv> but after GPT-#whatever everyone has moved that bar
[14:25:49] <amigojapan> mycroftiv: what about those nuts that are talking to nobody in the subway. How do you know you are not one of them?
[14:25:54] <mycroftiv> i grew up in the 1980s, computers seem intelligent to me
[14:25:55] <causative_> well, the computers that pass the turing test are not particularly smart
[14:26:02] <causative_> GPT-3 is smart in a certain way
[14:26:08] <mycroftiv> amigojapan: i am one of them, i have bipolar and sometimes manic delusions
[14:26:32] <causative_> you've heard of the invisible hand of the market
[14:26:32] <mycroftiv> but i can talk to people here and trust you all will tell me what i say makes sense and what is truly crazy and nonsense
[14:26:37] <amigojapan> mycroftiv: it could be so bad that all you see if just an illusion
[14:26:45] <causative_> perhaps it's an invisible hand guided by an invisible mind
[14:26:55] <causative_> a mind formed from the collective interactions of everybody in the economy
[14:27:02] <mycroftiv> amigojapan: thats fine too, if its all just a dream or simulation, its as real a reality as i have
[14:27:08] <mycroftiv> cauastive_: absolutely
[14:27:15] <Lumine> amigojapan: get a group of solipsists into a room and watch as they argue over which of them is real
[14:27:22] <amigojapan> I see mycroftiv
[14:27:40] <amigojapan> This is not solipsism Lumine
[14:27:50] <Lumine> Well then I'm confusing my terms
[14:27:52] <causative_> if they thought they were the only real person, why would they bother arguing? why would they care what the others think if the others aren't there?
[14:27:53] <mycroftiv> amigojapan: im an ontological maximalist, i think we are probably in books right now in some branch of the multiverse
[14:28:12] <mycroftiv> i mean you can make a pure statistical hard science case for that anyway
[14:28:39] <mycroftiv> given large enough state space and enough random variation, this is all written in the pages of a book 5030530403403040304040 light years away
[14:28:56] <amigojapan> Lumine: the difference is that in this idea there is a real world but we can just be nuts hallucinating everything in the NYC Subway
[14:29:00] <mycroftiv> thats an example of how science and mysticism can merge
[14:29:30] <mycroftiv> because the vast physical expanse of the cosmos and stastical randomness and calculating how far to travel before you find a book of your life can be done mathematically
[14:29:47] <mycroftiv> Max Tegmark does that kind of calculation in his mathematical universe book, fun stuff
[14:30:00] <amigojapan> mycroftiv: it seems mine and your beliefs are close, except for I don't believe in a multiverse do to lack of evidence
[14:30:24] <mycroftiv> amigojapan: well i try to not 'believe' in anything exactly, standard provisional ideas of belief revision
[14:30:53] <mycroftiv> i think multiverse is the most direct understanding of quantum mechanicsand also is a natural consequence of just physical size in the extreme
[14:31:02] <amigojapan> mycroftiv: you said you "believe"in other people existing
[14:31:37] <mycroftiv> that is one of the provisional beliefs i am most confident in
[14:31:45] <amigojapan> Ok
[14:31:55] <mycroftiv> as a casual way of speaking, i dont attach probabilities to everything
[14:32:05] <amigojapan> I see
[14:32:24] <mycroftiv> i 'believe' all the normal stuff to believe, but if you press me, i will say my belief in mars is provisional assuming telescopes work etc
[14:33:22] <amigojapan> mycroftiv: I think I would say something like "QM is in its infancy and we should not make up tall tales based on a small amount of knowledge
[14:33:40] <Lumine> Then what was the school of philosophy that thinks your mind is the only thing that exists and everyone else is part of your mind?
[14:33:41] <mycroftiv> we have good experimental predictions that work
[14:34:07] <mycroftiv> so its just understanding what the equations that generate those predictions are saying
[14:34:26] <mycroftiv> same as with any other scientific theory that makes accurate quantitative predictions about future measurements
[14:34:43] <amigojapan> Lumine: but that is not what I was describing. In what I described, other people do exist, we are just too nuts to see them
[14:35:09] <mycroftiv> I think W.H. Zurek and the decoherence school of thought in the Everett multiverse vein is a good take on current quantum issues
[14:35:20] <Lumine> amigojapan: right
[14:35:32] <mycroftiv> anyone interested in quantum reality, I highly recommend looking at the work of W.H. Zurek
[14:35:36] <causative_> agreed about the multiverse

[14:38:06] <arryana> that's always a bad sign in here

[14:38:38] <arryana> because 99% of people using that word are using it incorrectly
[14:38:56] <amigojapan> Brb
[14:39:23] <arryana> i have a friend over here who actually works in quantum mechanics, and his words on it are, 'once someone says quantum-anything you can be sure they're talking a load of tosh'
[14:39:52] <arryana> while he's certainly more cynical than i am in most ways, he's usually right about that one
[14:40:39] <mycroftiv> arryana: please quote me to him about W.H. Zurek if you wish to check somethings
[14:41:06] <arryana> he's a busy guy.  when we talk, it isn't to qupte random irc chatters.
[14:41:08] <arryana> no offense
[14:41:24] <mycroftiv> arryana: i am very eager to have anything i say about quantum decoherence and information theory and its philosophical meaning verified by experts
[14:41:38] <Lumine> arryana: I know of some concepts from QM, but I'm not comfortable discussing them because as said at one time, my education is lacking in almost all aspects.
[14:41:43] <mycroftiv> and i try to be very careful to stay with authoritative peer reviewed sources
[14:43:32] <mycroftiv> arryana: so i dont take offense, but im more than happy to take things to whatever level of scientific detail is necessary to be precise and non-pseudoscientific in discussion
[14:44:20] <mycroftiv> most of my work for the past few years has been doing formalized mathematics in a proof assistant to make sure im understanding the mathematics of ultrafilters correctly
[14:45:09] <mycroftiv> im -extremely- motivated to be doing things in a mathematically and scientifically meaningful way when it comes to philosophy
[14:45:53] <arryana> yeah, everything i know about mathematics could be written on my thumbnail in block letters with a sharpie, so i might be the wrong audience.
[14:47:11] <mycroftiv> well thats cool, i just want to communicate im all about getting into scientific and mathematicak details on anything and everything
[14:47:23] <arryana> the majority of my friends are scientists, mathematicians, and high level computer people, but i'm not one of them myself
[14:47:25] <mycroftiv> and if anyone thinks ive spoken scientific inaccuracy, im happy to find some sources
[14:48:49] <mycroftiv> i spent several years trying to research mathematical physics to write a book on the mathematics of music theory in relation to modern physics
[14:49:53] <mycroftiv> lost most of that work to a hard drive crash in about 2004 which was the start of a long arc of different things
[14:50:14] <mycroftiv> especially making sure to always have data backed up ;)
[14:50:54] <arryana> as a non-number-oriented person, i find it difficult to understand the advantage of reducing such things to numbers.
[14:51:23] <mycroftiv> music? well how you tune a musical instrument is based on arithmetic ratios to begin with
[14:51:44] <mycroftiv> every chord you hear is simple arithmetical ratios placeed in this regular crystal like mathematical grid
[14:52:01] <arryana> oh, no, i understand that it's done and in what format
[14:52:13] <arryana> but to me it's like reducing the experience of a sunset into a bunch of hex code
[14:52:41] <mycroftiv> i made my life as a semiprofessional musician and i never felt it reduced the beauty to study

[14:53:16] <arryana> as i said, i am a non-numbers person, so i'm speaking from my own position
[14:53:32] <mycroftiv> understanding how the emotion of music is connected to the mathematics is more or less my lifes work, im not arguing , just contextualizing
[14:53:50] <mycroftiv> because your view is often expressed, but i think the mathematics is the secret of the emotion
[14:54:05] <Lumine> I played the piano briefly in my teens, I wish I would've stuck with it
[14:54:26] <mycroftiv> and understanding who we are and the meaning of life - why the mathematical structure of music can make us cry seemed to me like it might offer hints

[15:22:58] <arryana> my other half is a musician, among other things.  there's no way he'd sit through listening to something like 10,000 maniacs or james taylor.
[15:23:16] <arryana> king crimson he could watch perform forever.
[15:24:07] <mycroftiv> i love king crimson but that is just free associational. dont think i know a single 10,000 maniacs. james taylor has That One Song.
[15:24:42] <arryana> i went to a king crimson concert with him once.
[15:25:20] <arryana> he laughed his ass off when i slept through most of the concert in self defense, and when asked what i thought of it, my answer was 'there were a lot of people on stage, but none of them seemed to be playing the same song'
[15:25:44] <arryana> i'm sure they're incredibly talented.  but to me it's a cacophany
[15:26:00] <arryana> so i /ignore it, inasmuch as that's possible in a concert hall
[15:26:03] <mycroftiv> i understand that. thats actually that mathematical structure and your ear hearing it

[15:26:47] <arryana> i'm sure it's wonderful to people whose minds work that way.  but it isn't mine.
[15:27:22] <mycroftiv> why some music sounds good and some music doesnt. there is very objective reason king crimson is not 'popular music' due to these mathematical and acoustic facts and their interaction with human perception
[15:28:06] <mycroftiv> so even without intellectual awareness of any mathematical issues involved, the actual structure of the mathematics of musical harmony and rhythm still manifests in the aesthetic experience
[15:28:24] <mycroftiv> since anyone can hear king crimson is discordant and unpleasant
[15:28:43] <mycroftiv> and we can show why mathematically in the way the music is put together
[15:29:32] <arryana> yeah.  still means nothing to me.
[15:30:12] <mycroftiv> king crimson means nothing to you, or the mathematical reasons why king crimson means nothing to you, means nothing to you - or probably both - and now all three?
[15:31:43] <arryana> yes.
[15:31:51] <mycroftiv> i understand
[15:32:10] <mycroftiv> what kind of philosophy stuffs do you take an interest in that are meaningful to you, if i can ask?
[15:33:11] <arryana> perspectives.
[15:33:19] <mycroftiv> i like that topic very much
[15:33:24] <arryana> what people think and why, how that relates to other people's beliefs.
[15:33:28] <arryana> which ones function and why.
[15:33:39] <mycroftiv> understanding different perspectives and how everyone has a valid model of reality is really interesting
[15:34:25] <mycroftiv> well, 'internally valid' is all i mean i think
[15:35:01] <mycroftiv> when you say 'which ones function and why' that sounds like a nice way to analyze, care to discuss more?
[15:35:21] <arryana> i don't understand that question
[15:36:04] <mycroftiv> you expressed interest in perspectives, and which ones function and why. im interested in that, how we define and assess, in your view.
[15:36:31] <mycroftiv> or just how you think about it, if im not asking well
[15:37:24] <arryana> that's not the sort of question i could answer in a sentence or even a paragraph.
[15:37:34] <arryana> that's the sort of thing that comes out when people talk over time.
[15:37:48] <mycroftiv> that makes sense, thanks
[15:38:03] <mycroftiv> ill keep the theme of 'what is a functional perspecive? how do you find one?' in mind

[15:40:30] <mycroftiv> that puts me in mind of a lot of visual metaphors of surveying a landscape and drawing the vanishing point lines and having accurate measurements to build something
[15:41:49] <arryana> huh  when i look at a landscape i just see what's there and then what'd change in different seasons and over time.
[15:42:20] <mycroftiv> id hope there are many functional perspectives on a single landscape
[15:43:05] <arryana> it's got it's own function just being what it is.
[15:43:10] <arryana> its
[15:44:12] <mycroftiv> that just-is-ness makes me think of more Tao and Zen concepts, although im not sure im in the appropriate cultural frame to fully understand those ideas
[15:44:53] <mycroftiv> i have a racing hyperverbal mind and i know being in the moment in an unalalyzed way and experiecing just-isness is important
[15:45:06] <arryana> yeah, no, i don't subscribe to either of those.
[15:46:07] <mycroftiv> i was just associating concepts in my own mind, not trying to label your beliefs
[15:50:56] <arryana> i don't know how useful it would be to categorize my statement in categories i don't believe in.
[15:55:28] <mycroftiv> i just had a particular association internally and shared it, i dont think it is necessarily useful or meaningful. i personally like Tao and Zen to the extent i understand them and often think of them
[15:55:50] <arryana> neither is my road.
[15:56:08] <mycroftiv> i try to walk all roads at once which is a bit awkward on the legs
[15:56:34] <arryana> i'm too old for that.  the older you get, the more you recognize and value time, and thus, make choices.
[15:56:37] <mycroftiv> i hope i can speak the language of a monotheist religious person or a scientific materialist or a mystic
[15:56:43] <mycroftiv> im almost 50, you are older?
[15:56:49] * arryana nods
[15:57:37] <mycroftiv> well, im not really convinced i will give up trying to understand all perspectives no matter how old i get, but thanks for the opinion
[15:57:52] <mycroftiv> i certainly believe in making choices
[15:58:07] <mycroftiv> how Free Will works is one of the most intersting philosophical questions, and i believe in free will
[15:58:16] <mycroftiv> and making a meaningful story for ourselves with our choices
[16:00:34] <mycroftiv> and finding a way to share our story with others, hear their stories, and be part of the Big Tree of Tales...but thats just kinda my overall vibe of hippie hope and so forth
[16:03:40] <arryana> everyone is part of 'the tree of tales' as you put it.  just most of us are leaves that last a season.
[16:04:40] <mycroftiv> hope someone paints us when we are all in full bloom
[16:04:46] <mycroftiv> or fall colors i guess

[16:05:08] <mycroftiv> nicely timed :)
[16:05:30] <Lumine> Well it was a response to your thought after all
[16:05:55] <mycroftiv> yes just for a re-entry of the voice into the music
[16:06:09] <arryana> i don't mind being a leaf in my season.  nor do i much care to be immortalized at any stage or other
[16:06:13] <arryana> but that's just me
[16:06:34] <mycroftiv> i figure its part of the nature of the tree to put forth its seeds
[16:06:49] <mycroftiv> so its not a static immortality but an ongoing wave of new life
[16:07:26] <mycroftiv> carrying the pattern from before, and if an artist from the outside happens to capture the traces also , it seems like its all part of something i like personally
[16:08:06] <arryana> if it works for you, more power to you.  i don't particularly care if there's any continuity.

[17:12:18] <Lumine> Not that anyone asked

[17:19:18] * arryana finishes molding sugru holders for tiny lights and goes back to knitting
[17:19:25] <Lumine> Anyway, "the ultimate colors" that are on the warm spectrum: fuchsia, crayola and saffron, and on the cold spectrum to balance it: indigo, cyan and teal. If you can make those colors work well enough, you've got a party.
[17:19:41] * arryana nods
[17:19:48] <Lumine> The warm vs cold thing is a given in color theory but I've tried them all and I've found this combo to be the best.
[17:22:02] <arryana> this is why you're the artist
[17:22:05] <arryana> i wouldn't know where to start
[17:23:43] <Lumine> It can make up for a very interesting image, depending on what you do with them. And you can try out different shades of all of them for a more cooled down image, or a very vivid one.
[17:24:43] <Lumine> I went with very vivid values and it paid off for the most well received piece

[17:40:20] * arryana nods
[17:40:32] <Lumine> I should be working with 16-bit images, instead I work with 8-bit
[17:41:13] <Lumine> But the file sizes are doubled, so it takes a lot of memory
[17:44:06] * arryana nods
[17:44:48] <Lumine> The range of colors is tremendous compared to 8-bit, but you always have to reduce the image in its color information when you put it on the web, so I'm not sure if it even matter in the end. Maybe someone with more knowledge on bits can confirm whether sRGB reduces the information of 16-bit images.

[17:57:35] <Lumine> That's why your working color profile should be something that provides a bigger gamut in terms of colors, before you convert it to sRGB, because you'll have more colors to use. I didn't know about the 16-bit until few years ago.
[17:59:14] <Lumine> Also, I had to download a color profile from archive.org because Adobe was being a bitch about theirs in their website. I'm used to using their color profile.

[22:28:36] <Thilastiko> the only important point is to keep fighting. Perpetual conflict is the heart of philosophomon

[22:30:53] <Thilastiko> rationality, trueness, faleness right, wrong - only make sence inside some totalizing system
[22:30:59] <causative_> In relation to a claim C, a rational curmudgeon is a person who is initially opposed to C, unfriendly to it, doesn't like the community that came up with C, doesn't want to believe C - but is nonetheless committed to being reasonable and fair.
[22:31:02] <Thilastiko> the world is bigger than any system
[22:31:24] <causative_> if you can persuade the rational curmudgeon that C is true, you have passed the curmudgeon test about claim C
[22:31:58] <causative_> it takes pretty good evidence to convince the curmudgeon.  Physical demonstrations work best.
[22:32:13] <Thilastiko> analytic philosophy isnt really about the psychology of conviction, and is really just about giving names to the various fallacies
[22:32:40] <Thilastiko> you can give names to your interlocuters fallacies, but that doesnt meant it will convince them of anything
[22:33:21] <causative_> analytic philosophy is about a lot more than fallacies
[22:33:31] <Thilastiko> unconvinced
[22:33:54] <causative_> most practicing academic philosophers say they are analytic philosophers, and certainly they are concerned with much more than fallacies
[22:35:28] <Thilastiko> thats because they are not thinking about it a that level. At its anaytic base every concept is just a "recognizer" program that will just spit out T of F to the text string "is this X" - for any X
[22:36:06] <causative_> that's oversimplified
[22:36:15] <causative_> what if the text string is half-true, or 3/4 true?
[22:36:36] <causative_> and what if it is true only with a certain probability?
[22:36:51] <Thilastiko> now you sound like a continental philosopher
[22:37:06] <causative_> no, these concepts are mathematical
[22:37:14] <Thilastiko> "what if X is only partly true? or only metaphorically true"

[22:37:32] <causative_> the mathematics of fuzzy logic and probability
[22:37:58] <causative_> when I say half-true I mean that literally, that you would assign a truth value of 0.5 to the proposition
[22:38:04] <causative_> or 0.7, or any number between 0 and 1
[22:38:39] <Thilastiko> p = 0.5 does not mean "half true"
[22:38:50] <causative_> correct, there's a difference between probability and fuzzy logic
[22:39:44] <Thilastiko> fussy logic is just a classifier syster. its not even a philosopht
[22:39:56] <causative_> fuzzy
[22:40:05] <Thilastiko> fuzzy logic is just a branch of math
[22:40:16] <causative_> an example of a statement that might be half true: suppose my phone has been damaged and bluetooth no longer works and there's a crack in the screen and it keeps dropping calls
[22:40:24] <causative_> and then suppose I say "well at least it still works."
[22:40:34] <causative_> that would be half true; it doesn't *entirely* work, but it doesn't entirely not work, either.
[22:40:50] <Thilastiko> anyway, the whole concept of "truth" is only defined in a formal logic
[22:40:51] <causative_> so we might assign a truth value between 0 and 1 to that claim, such as 0.5 or 0.7
[22:41:01] <Thilastiko> there is no "truth" in the real worls
[22:41:06] <Thilastiko> *world
[22:41:43] <causative_> fuzzy logic is also the solution to the sorites paradox
[22:41:53] <Thilastiko> "trueness" whetehr bivalen or continous is only a property of a statement
[22:41:58] <causative_> the paradox of where you start with a heap of sand, and remove grains one at a time, and you ask when it is no longer a heap
[22:42:04] <Thilastiko> not a property of real objects
[22:42:25] <causative_> fuzzy logic allows you to say that the sand stops being a heap gradually, instead of all at once when a single critical grain of sand is removed

[22:47:52] <Thilastiko> theres a lot of assumptions there already
[22:47:53] <causative_> well, it's internal as well - it's everywhere.  It's something that doesn't depend on what we think about it
[22:48:15] <Thilastiko> why is ther an internal-external dichotomy?
[22:48:15] <causative_> without accepting an external world there isn't much we can do, philosophically - we are adrift.  If the external world isn't real then other people aren't real either, so any notion of "social construction" predicated on other people, without an external world, falls flat on its face.
[22:48:36] <Thilastiko> thats only if you think subjectivity is a real thing
[22:48:59] <Thilastiko> why cant there just be one world?

[22:52:50] <Thilastiko> the illusion of "self" just comes from "self-refferential" loops in lasagna's structure
[22:54:02] <Thilastiko> saying one half of that loop is "internal" and the other half is "external" misses the important patterns completely
[22:54:39] <causative_> fine, but like I said, I don't mean to draw that distinction by saying "external"
[22:55:13] <causative_> it's just to draw a contrast with ideas that everything is in your mind, or the world is whatever you think it is, and stuff like that
[22:55:19] <mycroftiv> i dont really think its an 'illusion' that i have a self, because i can make my hands - part of my self - move via internal volition, but no matter how hard i use my intention, that rock over there that isnt part of myself never does what my hands do

[22:58:16] <Thilastiko> if you really do some "introspection" you will really see that you are not a self. People with a severed corpus callosum are an extreme case of this
[22:58:39] <Thilastiko> ther is no one,single, center of subjectivity in you.
[22:59:26] <Thilastiko> each cerebellar helispher can just as easily be called an independiaen sentient being, and so can every cell in your body
[22:59:33] <causative_> doesn't have to be a center of subjectivity
[22:59:38] <mycroftiv> thilastiko: sure, it often feels like the cerebral cortex is along for the ride, doing all this analysis on top of an autonomous survival-brain, we are layered, and everything is decomposable ultimately to lower organizational layers

[23:03:58] <Thilastiko> thats just anthropomorphizing

[23:05:27] <Thilastiko> anthropomorpjhizing is just humaity's first, worst attempt to understand stuff

[23:06:09] <mycroftiv> thilastiko: i agree that the 'naive nonphilosophical' view of the interior self and exterior universe being divided and different realms not made of the same stuff is wrong, but with care about definitions, 'self' doesnt have to imply that
[23:06:12] <Thilastiko> height and weight are not "uniquely" human characteristics

[23:07:54] <causative_> conscious not in the sense of being able to think abstractly, but in the sense of having subjective experiences
[23:08:16] <causative_> there are multiple senses of consciousness and you are using a different one from the one I'm talking about
[23:08:34] <Thilastiko> "experience" is a huge term. lots of things have experience, can sence pain, are aware, etc
[23:08:47] <mycroftiv> thilastiko: that book is interesting but very few people think it is a good scientific theory
[23:08:50] <causative_> yes, and when you say "are aware" that's the crux of it
[23:08:58] <Thilastiko> but those traits are not the same as consciousness and they have definite physical instantiations
[23:09:15] <causative_> you're just using the wrong definition
[23:09:33] <causative_> there is a sense of consciousness in which rabbits are conscious, or newts are conscious
[23:09:44] <Thilastiko> mycroftiv: modern psychologists dont talk about it much, but evidence has only ever beed added to its side
[23:09:53] <causative_> this sense of consciousness doesn't require self-awareness, doesn't require higher abstract thought
[23:10:12] <causative_> it's sentience as opposed to sapience
[23:10:14] <Thilastiko> consciousness is defined behaviourally, anythign that acts conscious is conscious. thats what the whole turing test is about

[23:12:28] <mycroftiv> thilastiko: definitely NOT thinking that consciousness and human awareness was changed by the cultural and language issues discussed by Jaynes in as fundamental a way as is claimed there.
[23:12:33] <causative_> a lasagna is made of 10^25 or so atoms, each of them interacting with the others in complex electrical ways, and vibrating in response to phonons passing through and reflecting and diffracting through the lasagna
[23:12:53] <causative_> our greatest supercomputers can't come anywhere close to simulating exactly what is happening in a lasagna
[23:13:16] <causative_> beyond the phonons, a lasagna also is constantly chemically reacting with itself and with its container and the air
[23:13:24] <Thilastiko> lasagna also includes the "conditions for existance" of thos 10^25 atoms
[23:13:26] <causative_> quite a lot going on in a lasagna
[23:13:28] <Thilastiko> it has many layers
[23:13:52] <I_Am_M00t> humanity is a superset of lasagna, obviously

[23:22:08] <causative_> mycroftiv, the core problem I run into when trying to do things like that is defining what exactly it means, mathematically, for something to be a system within the universe
[23:22:14] <causative_> for it to be a subsystem within the universe
[23:23:01] <causative_> like, a pendulum in a grandfather clock is a subsystem of the universe.  A computer is too, and so is a brain.  A (sub)system takes input from its environment, has internal state that changes as a result, and produces output.  But how do we say this mathematically?
[23:23:21] <mycroftiv> causative_: i agree any kind of real precision is hard, but just seeing an individual/mind is a subset of the whole universe seems clear as a starting place?
[23:23:45] <causative_> before I admit that a mind is a subset of the whole universe, what is the universe a set of?
[23:24:00] <mycroftiv> possible states id say
[23:24:09] <mycroftiv> possible particle arrangements
[23:24:23] <causative_> that's vague
[23:24:51] <mycroftiv> i dont think its that vague scientifically, counting the state space of a physical system is possible
[23:25:20] <causative_> if you are saying the universe is the set of *the whole universe's* possible states, then the mind is not a subset of the universe, because the mind is not a possible state for the *entire universe*.

[23:25:43] <causative_> nor is the mind a subset of possible states for the entire universe
[23:25:55] <causative_> probably
[23:26:07] <causative_> if that's what you're saying you'd have to justify it to me
[23:26:26] <mycroftiv> large set of particles, powerset of its possible states. subset of particles is an indivudal, it as a subset also has a powerset of possible states.
[23:27:02] <causative_> let's speak precisely then, because we're trying to use math
[23:27:23] <mycroftiv> i agree, i have some computer formalization of this but its probably not that comprehensible as a starting place
[23:27:35] <causative_> you're saying the mind is a subset of the particles in the universe?
[23:28:02] <mycroftiv> im saying my physical body is a collection of particles that is asubset of the set of particles of the universe.
[23:28:12] <mycroftiv> my mind correlates with arrangements of particles in my brain, pretty much
[23:28:14] <causative_> sure, at a single point in time you may say that
[23:28:21] <causative_> over time, the collection of particles in your body changes
[23:28:52] <causative_> so you may say it is a time-varying collection of particles
[23:29:01] <mycroftiv> scientifically we often/usually think of 4d minkowski spacetime existing 'all at once' so we can also stabilize set membership that way
[23:30:14] <causative_> well that's what I'm saying, you can't say that the body is a collection of particles in 4d spacetime because the elements of the collection change over time
[23:30:28] <causative_> you breathe, eat, metabolize
[23:30:33] <causative_> your skin flakes off
[23:30:51] <mycroftiv> if you go to the 4d block universe view thats all just a single static entity
[23:30:52] <causative_> so it's not a collection of particles - what is it then?  if you want to say it's a set, what is it a set of?
[23:31:03] <causative_> what are the elements of the set?
[23:31:29] <mycroftiv> its not hard at all to define the set of all particles that occupy a given region of 4d spacetime, but timeslices are fine also and probably a better fit
[23:31:50] <causative_> yes but mycroftiv simply specifying that set doesn't give the person
[23:32:14] <causative_> imagine the 4d picture, and highlight all the particles in your "human" set
[23:32:25] <causative_> the highlighted particles will be a rat's nest of trails going everywhere
[23:32:46] <mycroftiv> im offering for discussion the starting place that my 'inner mental experiences' can be correlated with the collection of arrangements of particles in a brain, each mental state being a few seconds worth of activity, approx
[23:32:56] <causative_> each particle draws a curved line from past to future, and at some point it spends a little time nearer the others before roving off away again
[23:33:26] <causative_> the highlighted particles don't look, in the picture, anything like a human body, *except* in one particular time slice
[23:33:43] <mycroftiv> mathematical logic and physics and set theory has no problem manipulating all that data concretely, if we want 'the set of particles in the cats brain between noon and 1pm and what they did' that is definable
[23:34:14] <causative_> the set of particles is definable but not sufficient as a definition of "the cat's brain between noon and 1pm"
[23:34:20] <causative_> you have to also include the time
[23:34:59] <causative_> so you might talk about a tuple:  ("the set of particles in the cats brain between noon and 1pm", noon, 1pm).  Three elements of the tuple: the particles, the start time, and the end time
[23:35:18] <mycroftiv> yep thats a good way to frame the data, thanks
[23:35:30] <causative_> so what you have there is not a set of particles - the base data type is a tuple
[23:35:37] <causative_> so it's not a subset of the universe
[23:35:42] <mycroftiv> absolutely any tuple can be a set
[23:35:44] <causative_> nor is it a subset of the universe's particles
[23:35:52] <mycroftiv> that is really simple basic set theory and logic
[23:35:58] <causative_> yes, I know it can be a set but it's not the kind of set that would be a subset of the universe
[23:36:07] <causative_> it only has a handful of elements
[23:36:22] <mycroftiv> it certainly would be a subset of the powerset of the universe
[23:36:27] <mycroftiv> in a strict mathematical sense
[23:36:55] <causative_> (a, b) has only the elements {a}, and {a, b} - two elements
[23:37:22] <mycroftiv> the powerset of {a, b} is {0, {a} {b} {a, b}}
[23:37:50] <mycroftiv> you get all possibilities including the ones that ignore almost everything
[23:37:51] <causative_> talking about a kuratowski pair:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordered_pair#Kuratowski%27s_definition
[23:37:52] <ro-bot-o> [url] Ordered pair - Wikipedia | en.wikipedia.org
[23:38:06] <causative_> the powerset of {a, b} cannot be identified as the pair (a, b)
[23:38:35] <mycroftiv> if its kuratowski pair you get even more seeming complexity
[23:38:53] <mycroftiv> kuratowski is an ordering with a a,b to indicate 1st and second
[23:38:59] <causative_> yes
[23:39:14] <causative_> anyway, in some way this tuple ("the set of particles in the cats brain between noon and 1pm", noon, 1pm) can be a set
[23:39:26] <causative_> but you gotta say how and it's only going to have a few elements, perhaps only three elements
[23:39:47] <causative_> e.g. you could encode it as {{0, "the set of particles in the cats brain between noon and 1pm"}, {1, noon}, {2, 1pm}}
[23:40:19] <causative_> and how is that set of three elements a subset of the universe?  what elements does the universe have, such that those three elements would be a subset?
[23:41:57] <mycroftiv> as i stated to start with, i am just saying lets use physically measurable particle data. if we consider 'the solar system' as the universe - to simplify for a moment - it is not hard to identify the particles in the cat and their states as subset of solar system particles and their states
[23:42:14] <mycroftiv> if the generality of 'universe' is a hangup here
[23:42:45] <causative_> so are you saying that the elements of the cat at a particular time are pairs of the form (particle ID, particle state)?
[23:42:58] <causative_> and that the solar system is also a set of pairs of the form (particle ID, particle state)?
[23:43:48] <mycroftiv> that seems fine
[23:43:56] <causative_> and what do you include in your particle state?
[23:44:19] <mycroftiv> whatever standard physics decides is the best description as of today
[23:44:28] <causative_> does particle state, include time and position, (x, y, z, t) ?
[23:44:29] <mycroftiv> which i can summarize but seems way more detailed than relevant
[23:44:38] <mycroftiv> sorry think i missed your last line, client glitch
[23:44:43] <causative_> does particle state, include time and position, (x, y, z, t) ?
[23:45:07] <mycroftiv> well due to quantum issues we cant offer precise specs for all particles at once generally
[23:45:09] <causative_> or does it only include the state *internal* to the particle?
[23:45:39] <causative_> the position of the particle is not internal to it - the particle doesn't "know" where it is, that's something that comes from an external coordinate frame
[23:45:59] <mycroftiv> but i think the basic ideas of particle state spaces and how this is used in physics is all adequate here, so far im not even saying anything at all of my own, this is 100% just me trying to explain standard science and math labeling
[23:46:40] <mycroftiv> which i think you also understand pretty well, and are trying to pin down precisely what i have in mind, but i havent really tried to say anything other than what i perceive as normative vocabulary yet
[23:47:08] <causative_> it's just that if you want to say a person is a *subset* of the universe you have to be pretty precise about set terminology so that is actually true
[23:47:10] <mycroftiv> what i would think of as a 'standard conventional science setup' for discussing brain states
[23:47:23] <causative_> in the way I've tried to model systems, a system is *not* a subset of the universe
[23:47:42] <mycroftiv> causative: actually i think we are 100% fine speaking that way and there arent the technical issues you are saying there are.
[23:47:43] <causative_> in my models, I typically say that the universe is a tuple of a few things, and a system is also a tuple of a few things
[23:47:54] <causative_> and they wouldn't be subsets of each other
[23:48:02] <causative_> they would relate to each other, but the relation would not be subsethood
[23:49:56] *** Quits: skapata (~Skapata@user/skapata) (Remote host closed the connection)
[23:50:16] <causative_> the difficulty is when we want to track the system through time
[23:50:37] <causative_> you know, the cat is not simply the particles at a particular position and time - the cat moves and changes and we want to model those changes
[23:50:47] <mycroftiv> well, to provide an example i think is adequate and clarifying, 'the water in the atlantic ocean' seems just fine to me as a subset of 'the water on the planet earth' and we can attach and track temporal boundaries to this fine also
[23:51:21] <causative_> gotta be specific about what you mean
[23:51:42] <causative_> I wouldn't so blithly use subsethood even when talking about water, because of how water changes over time
[23:52:30] <causative_> like, if you want to track temporal boundaries, then you're using tuples, not just plain sets
[23:52:38] <causative_> like with the cat
[23:52:40] <mycroftiv> tuples are sets
[23:53:44] <mycroftiv> any collection of data that is not 'too large' aka class-sized collection is a set and tuples are simple, its just like kuratowski pair system but more items if you want ordered ones
[23:54:16] <causative_> so let's do like we did with the cat.  {{0, the set of particles involved in water on planet Earth on Jan 15 between 1 and 2 PM}, {1, Jan 15 1 PM}, {2, Jan 15 2 PM}}
[23:54:35] <causative_> {{0, the set of particles involved in water in the Atlantic ocean on Jan 15 between 1 and 2 PM}, {1, Jan 15 1 PM}, {2, Jan 15 2 PM}}
[23:54:42] <causative_> the second one is *not* a subset of the first
[23:55:08] <causative_> it has two elements in common, but the third element is different between the two sets
[23:55:15] <mycroftiv> you know venn diagrams right?
[23:55:18] <causative_> ofc
[23:55:41] <mycroftiv> we can just label sections of a venn diagram 'full ocean' and 'atlantic ocean'

[23:56:27] <causative_> alright, here's how you can do it
[23:56:27] <mycroftiv> i hadnt offered venn diagrams to try to make the labeling as clear and simple as possible
[23:57:14] <mycroftiv> and simple spatial containment works as set and subset relation
[23:57:21] <mycroftiv> my liver is a subset of my body
[23:57:24] <I_Am_M00t> 🤔
[23:57:36] <causative_> you say the water on the earth is the set of all tuples of the form (a, b) where a is a particle ID, and b is a position and time for the particle, such that the particle is involved in water on Earth on Jan 15 at 2 PM.
[23:57:50] <causative_> and similar for the water in the atlantic ocean on Jan 15 at 2 PM.
[23:57:58] <causative_> if you do this, you *can* say that one is a subset of the other
[23:58:11] <causative_> but you aren't talking about "the oceans" anymore - you're talking about "the oceans on jan 15 at 2 PM"
[23:58:16] <causative_> which is a more specific, and different concept
