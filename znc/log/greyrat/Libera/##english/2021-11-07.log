[00:02:15] <huf> there's a special computery meaning, but that's generally understood
[00:02:28] <huf> there's no need to specially define it in RFCs i think
[00:02:40] <huf> it's not like simple words which could mean anything
[00:03:07] <huf> bullgard4: have you found a place where it can be misunderstood?

[04:15:05] <tinsoldier> Embrio:This is differemt to the classical word embryo becuase this is a guy called rio (japanesse dude) and he looks like he belong in a womens womb <https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=embrio>
[04:19:26] <JustLandedOnMars> there is a quote
[04:19:28] <JustLandedOnMars> "A man may fish with the worm that hath eat of a king, and eat of the fish that hath fed of that worm."   -- William Shakespeare.
[04:19:32] <JustLandedOnMars> what is that "hath" means here ?
[04:20:34] <Me-me> !w embrocate
[04:20:35] <tinsoldier> embrocate — Verb: 1. (medicine, transitive) To moisten and rub (a diseased part) with a liquid substance, as with spirit, oil, etc., by means of a cloth or sponge. https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/embrocate
[04:21:18] <Me-me> JustLandedOnMars: Hath is archaic, old english. In this context it serves in place of "has". I believe it has other grammatical implications as well.
[04:21:42] <Me-me> I shouldn't say old english. Middle english? Elizabethan, perhaps.
[04:26:51] <MetaNova> I thought this was really neat, related to English: https://youtu.be/hxNlAhE3468?t=190 timestamp should be the ESL teacher, ignore the rest of the video/thumbnail

[19:07:26] <[itchyjunk]> so i have confused myself. when writing a paper, what kinda stuff do i need to cite.
[19:07:40] <[itchyjunk]> I am claiming someone is one of the most prominant mathematician of all time
[19:07:54] <[itchyjunk]> if i don't cite it, it gets treated as my opinion?
[19:08:00] <[itchyjunk]> I would be fine with that
[19:11:47] <kurahaupo> [itchyjunk]: If you're writing a paper you should have evidence for each assertion, and citations are a way of proving that you have that evidence
[19:12:43] <[itchyjunk]> Yes, but citing every sentence in a 6 page paper seems a bit overboard.
[19:12:53] <kurahaupo> You can assert your own preferences and life narrative, but you should document anyone else's statements
[19:13:13] <[itchyjunk]> Who gets to claim someone is good or bad at a thing, though?
[19:13:18] <[itchyjunk]> it's someone opinion after all.
[19:13:49] <kurahaupo> "I think they're bad" doesn't need a citation, but it doesn't add much value to your paper
[19:14:24] <[itchyjunk]> I already said it's a claim about their prominence.
[19:14:44] <kurahaupo> You may need several sentences to explain one point, so that's only one citation (unless you think you need multiple citations for the one idea)
[19:14:55] <kurahaupo> whose claim?
[19:15:00] <[itchyjunk]> What you're saying in unrealistic.
[19:15:18] <[itchyjunk]> I've read enough papers to know that this is only done for some specific claims that needs hilighting.
[19:15:21] <[itchyjunk]> Not for entire paper.
[19:15:41] <[itchyjunk]> Else a 6 page paper would have a 6 page long citations.
[19:15:56] <kurahaupo> Your analysis doesn't need citations, only the claims of underlying facts
[19:17:03] <[itchyjunk]> So a claim about their prominence is my analysis or is it an underlying fact?
[19:17:15] <[itchyjunk]> That doesn't really answer me. Just kicks the can forward.
[19:17:38] <kurahaupo> You may use one cited work for many facts of course.
[19:19:00] <kurahaupo> Most papers that I've read have at least one footnote number per sentence; but since they often refer to the same referenced work, the list isn't so huge.
[19:22:27] <kurahaupo> If you say that something is "good" or "bad", there are 3 cases: 1. It's someone else's opinion, in which case you should cite that;
[19:22:28] <kurahaupo>  2. It's your opinion based on information from other sources, in which case you don't cite the opinion, but you explain how you came to that conclusion, and cite the sources for the facts you've used;
[19:22:28] <kurahaupo>  3. It's your own opinion based on emotions. That doesn't need need citations, but what would be the point of including it?
[19:23:07] <kurahaupo> [itchyjunk]: does the help?

[19:26:10] <[itchyjunk]> I'll pretend it's an emotional response then.
[19:26:30] <[itchyjunk]> Caliming someone is prominent is fine but trying to cite it would distract from the paper too much
[19:28:03] <kurahaupo> Response to what?
[19:28:33] *** Joins: kerfluffy (~kerfluffy@user/kerfluffy)
[19:29:05] <kurahaupo> As a rule you don't need to cite "the sky is blue", or facts that people can easily check for themselves
