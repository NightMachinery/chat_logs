[14:00:41] <_inky> i was always alert when people were posting even new versions of the app in chat, as a binary file.
[14:00:45] <_inky> asking to test.
[14:01:45] <_inky> only installed from repos. of course repos don't mean there will be no problem.
[14:03:38] <_inky> we need reproducible builds for every repo, plus... still, the source may contain the problem, so enough eyes to look at the source. distribution like manjaro anyway has resources to at least look like that at the source before merging in repo.

[19:07:02] <Joanna> inky thanks for the interesting link. I’ve often said that operating systems should not allow programs to do unreasonable things. I don’t know enough about operating systems to suggest what changes should be made. In general someone you have never seen before or hardly showing up with an executable is rather suspicious. However this is also a way to inspire the makers of pine phones to make better code. Constantly being attacked 
[19:07:02] <Joanna> will definitely make you make better code.
[19:07:27] <Joanna> In my experience...
[19:40:34] <inky> it's interesting that makers of pinephone don't deal with software at all.
[19:40:44] <inky> they only do hardware
[19:42:31] <jan6> you can never define "reasonable" because if you do, you prevent a lot of creative, or useful things
[19:44:30] *** Joins: _inky (~inky_@188.115.244.176)
[19:48:41] <_inky> so they only do hardware, and there are 17 distributions of different operating systems.
[19:48:53] <_inky> it is sort of refercence device for open source developers to tinker with.
[19:49:33] <_inky> the pinephone is considered to be a weak device, but i don't think it's weak. i think the software people try to run on it is bloated, very often.
[19:49:54] <_inky> so there are operating systems that are more lightweight or less. better supported or not.
[19:50:22] <_inky> but the hw support gets better. some who need the heavy software to run, will be probably comfortable with pinephone pro.
[19:50:51] <_inky> about os: so that's a regular linux. it was manjaro, the os that was 'hacked', and
[19:51:12] <_inky> obviously it is very much in windows culture to download random installers from here and from there and install those.
[19:51:32] <_inky> i remember the time when it was the default, people were downloading sw from different places, or from some forums.
[19:52:02] <_inky> the debian in 90ies brought the concept of store: central repos where the binaries are built from sources.
[19:52:07] <_inky> for different architectures.
[19:53:01] <_inky> now f-droid for android also builts software themselves. so if your source is clean, it doesn't mean that the binary you are distributing at the same website (even if it's github or sourceforfe) corresponds to that source.
[19:53:56] <_inky> that's why they build the software themselves. also there is a package maintainer who does the packaging and should look in to the source code, and then there are moderators who actually merge the packages to the testing tree, then the package slows makes its way to the stable repo.
[19:54:51] <_inky> so if people install js modules via npm in home, those packages have much lesser audit (or none), in the contrary, if one installs a js module from debian repo, that module have had passed some kind of audit.
[19:55:43] <_inky> not that it's impossible to have a malicious code in os repos, but so far afaik it never happened. while it happened that there was malicious code in npm repos, in firefox add-on repos...
[19:56:31] <_inky> also some distributions also have software profiles in there
[19:56:46] <_inky> repos for selinux.
[19:57:26] <_inky> selinux is what apparmor, or android's runtime 'permission giver' is based on.
[19:57:39] <_inky> it's a linux kernel subsystem, by which you can forbid or permit
[19:57:47] <_inky> certain accesses to certain programs.
[19:58:28] <_inky> let's say if you install some software, let's say pidgin, you also can install its selinux profile, which will forbid it to access anything other than network and directory ~/.purple where it stores tho configs and logs.
[19:58:41] <_inky> there is other option in openbsd. what was it called?
[19:59:01] <_inky> pledge!
[19:59:17] <_inky> it is also runtime protection, but the packager of the software declares that this program requires these accesses.
[19:59:41] <_inky> so after the program was built, at runtiem, if it does something else - lets say it wants to connect to the network, when it wasn't previously declared - it gets killed.
[20:00:34] <_inky> that was why the bash exploit several years ago wasn't (if i don't mix things up) wasn't working on openbsd - it wasn't declared that bash should use network.
[20:00:43] <_inky> on the contrary, in android network access is considered 'safe' so
[20:01:30] <_inky> nobody prevents apps  to connect to the network.
[20:01:56] <_inky> thus you cannot, for instance, prevent it from downloading an ad to show you, or to send the usage data to the developers company.
[20:02:18] <_inky> i remember time, i believe it was about 2014-2015, and it was android 4,
[20:02:29] <_inky> so it did not have such kind of runtime 'permission giver',
[20:02:50] <_inky> but cyanogenmod developers have had added 'privacy guard' software to that old android os.
[20:03:55] <_inky> and it was catching the accesses at runtime, and it wousd ask you - thisk app requires network or camera access.
[20:04:12] <_inky> or you could configure it to always forbid, or to ask...
[20:04:38] <_inky> so my friend installed cyanogenmod on his xperia, and it had privacy guard.
[20:04:53] <_inky> and he also was running tor, and routing all the traffic via tor, but he also installed viber.
[20:05:15] <_inky> so we were drinking tea together, and every 5 minutes the viber wanted to use the camera.
[20:05:33] <_inky> and he was enjoying looking at it and disallowing that.
[20:05:51] <_inky> then eventually he changed the option to not ask but just disallow.
[20:06:11] <_inky> and he was getting thousands of disallowed camera requests from viber.
[20:06:27] <_inky> i think it was because he was running tor, and viber wanted to gather information about tor users.

[21:56:41] <jan6> 18:19 <_inky> the pinephone is considered to be a weak device, but i don't think it's weak. i think the software people try to run on it is bloated, very often.
[21:56:45] *** Quits: dez (uid92154@user/dez) (Quit: Connection closed for inactivity)
[21:56:48] <jan6> because desktop linux is bloated
[21:57:16] <jan6> and since there's no real mobile linux, people tend to run the bloated desktop stuff, trying to fix the UI, and not making the software itself better
[21:57:49] <jan6> 18:21 <_inky> obviously it is very much in windows culture to download random installers from here and from there and install those.
[21:57:56] <jan6> also in linux culture, as of late
[21:58:05] <jan6> "just curl|sudo bash to install"
[22:01:09] *** Quits: Joanna (uid57472@id-57472.lymington.irccloud.com) (Quit: Connection closed for inactivity)
[22:02:56] <jan6> also for linux, you can also, even without selinux, declare what functionality your program needs, which includes some that would otherwise need root access, and can declare which of those flags will get shared to forked instances, although I think this functionality only expands the working permissions, not restricts
[22:21:42] <jan6> also at android, this is why root access is so important, you CAN use a firewall app to limit other app's access to internet, or to block certain requests (like ads), but without root, it requires jumping through the VPN loop, which means you can't do that AND use a normal VPN, unless you use root
