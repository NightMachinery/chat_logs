[00:09:40] <filipepe> Hello good friends
[00:10:23] <kuudes> hi filipepe
[00:10:53] <kuudes> gwern, yes, indeed it is the best case
[00:11:12] <kuudes> I am just wondering if one should start to update that boeing might have something general errors going on
[00:11:19] <kuudes> but I guess there are just a lot of planes
[00:11:31] <kuudes> and few plane making companies
[00:11:47] <gwern> you shouldn't update upwards today unless you were updating downwards on all the days between today and the last 737-max crash
[00:12:06] <gwern> dbohdan: what's a 'hi-color image'?
[00:12:20] <kuudes> I mean, sure, any day without crash is an update towards less crashes, yes
[00:12:34] <kuudes> I guess I should check the actual data
[00:12:47] <kuudes> most likely flying is still the safest thing to do
[00:13:14] <kuudes> but it just feels that western aircraft shouldn't crash much at all, because we have overoptimized the safety
[00:14:02] <filipepe> Why is it overoptimized? How can you determine that?

[00:14:17] <Robomot> High color - Wikipedia (High color graphics is a method of storing image information in a computer's memory such that each pixel is represented by two bytes. Usually the color is represented by all 16 bits, but some devices also support 15-bit high color.[1] …)
[00:15:23] <kuudes> 0 crashes sounds very likely too little crashes for optimal. likely allowing some amount of death could allow resources to be used other things such as lower costs or larger throughput or whatever
[00:16:41] <filipepe> Seems subjective

[01:25:28] <shawwwn> yes
[01:26:48] <gwern> like, there's no compiler or lint warning? python is all "well, he just called a pure operation and then threw away the results. sounds crazy to me, but you're the boss!"

[01:27:35] <gwern> the will of apollo?
[01:28:01] <kuudes> is operator overloading a thing in python?
[01:28:12] <kuudes> I mean, could there be side effects from + or something
[01:29:13] <gwern> python should know at runtime that it's calling pure operations on numbers there. I'm not sure what '+' is in that context but I assume it's like a numpy or jax operator which is known to be pure
[01:29:58] <shawwwn> operator overloading is indeed a thing, and I'm not sure there's a good way to verify that pure returns are consumed
[01:30:17] <shawwwn> maybe there is, but it would e.g. get in the way of debugging. maybe. maybe not
[01:30:29] <gwern> (but brutal. in haskell, as written that'd just be an error, and that'd be definitely a warning if you did something like 'let x' or 'x <-' but then didn't use 'x'.)
[01:30:32] <shawwwn> if all operations were terminated with some kind of terminator expression, then you could walk backwards and verify that all operations were consumed once
[01:31:08] <gwern> (still, even in a language like JS or Python, I'd expect the compiler or linter to catch that. it's very 'if (x = 1)' in dumbness of footgun)

[01:38:45] <shawwwn> could've had a brazillion dollars of value written by now
[01:45:10] <kuudes> I have started to use if (constant == variable) in my code for defensiveness
[01:45:26] <shawwwn> unfortunately that wouldn't've saved me here, I think
[01:45:30] <shawwwn> the goal was to mutate x
[01:45:37] <shawwwn> well, more specifically, to replace x with an updated x
[01:45:46] <kuudes> yeah, x += m
[01:45:56] <shawwwn> sure, but then you run into the same problem (x + m)
[01:46:03] <kuudes> ?
[01:46:08] <shawwwn> typing x + m instead of x += m
[01:46:11] <shawwwn> that's basically what happened to me.
[01:46:16] <kuudes> ah, indeed
[01:46:20] <shawwwn> the goal is to make sure that every intermediate expression ends up "consumed" by something
[01:46:34] <shawwwn> you can do that if you make your own computation graph wrapper, which isn't *too* hard
[01:46:49] <shawwwn> and then at the end of your computations, you do a .consume() and walk the graph to make sure all the intermediate nodes are actually consumed
[01:46:51] <gwern> ('x + x' is also probably something a linter should warn about. why would you write that instead of '2*x')
[01:47:09] <shawwwn> you know, the irony is
[01:47:16] <shawwwn> if I'd been using pycharm to write this, it probably would have caught that.
[01:47:34] <shawwwn> I was just hacking away in vim like I used to.
[01:47:44] <gwern> sounds worth checking
[01:52:22] <shawwwn> (pycharm has lots of built-in linting-type stuff. it's warning-only, meaning it highlights problems in yellow, but that would've been enough to draw my eye to it.)
[01:54:19] <gwern> I say 'worth checking' because people are asking about whether python linters catch it, and you've lost so much time and energy to it that this may be a good reason to revert to pycharm or investigate how to enable better vim linting

[04:03:36] <kuudes> tbf I have considered if I should buy an oxygen generator in case hospitalizations start to rise even with vaccinations
[04:03:53] <kuudes> a veterinary one costs about 1000 e
[04:04:17] <kuudes> I have abstained of it for now, and keep following what happens in uk
[04:05:01] <kuudes> currently our local medical supply scalper price for such seems to be about in regular market price
[04:06:19] <two2thehead> huh TIL
[04:06:43] <two2thehead> fwiiw if the scalper prices are roughly matching market prices, that's a good thing
[04:06:54] <two2thehead> and ceteris paribus, I'd want to have one
[04:07:01] <two2thehead> but that is just me
[04:07:01] <kuudes> well, hospitalizations and icu utilization are in exponential rise, but they are only in around +10% per week while case counts are +70% per week
[04:07:13] <two2thehead> I presume you have a pulse oximeter?
[04:07:15] <kuudes> in uk
[04:07:24] <kuudes> I have, but not a recording one
[04:07:37] <kuudes> I got a cpap, which was net good as I indeed was found to have sleep apnea
[04:07:42] <two2thehead> ah, well that may be something you could look into
[04:07:48] <two2thehead> huh. Same as me
[04:07:58] <two2thehead> sleep apnea besties! \O/
[04:08:09] <kuudes> eh, ok :)
[04:08:30] <kuudes> how should one interpret that +70% vs +10% btw?
[04:08:51] <kuudes> will it keep being those same numbers until uk will be at herd immunity?
[04:09:18] <kuudes> that sounds odd, as wouldn't that mean cfr would be exponentially lowering?
[04:09:25] <two2thehead> I'm not an expert, but the delta variant *without the vaccines* would be wrecking havok imo
[04:09:50] <kuudes> gwern, you know math well, how do you see it?
[04:10:30] <gwern> the case where buying a can of oxygen pays off seems extremely remote
[04:10:40] <kuudes> indeed. so far
[04:10:55] <kuudes> but the 70% vs 10% puzzles me. I don't think I understand what is going on
[04:11:42] <kuudes> like, also in the case where vaccines work well, shouldn't those rates be about equal? the rate of icu/infected would just be lower
[04:11:43] <two2thehead> could be the vaccines having an effect
[04:13:45] <two2thehead> kuudes, didn't most studies show that vaccines lessen the affects of the virus and by extension the worst case scenario of ICU usages?
[04:14:39] <kuudes> yes, but as I said, even so the growth rates should be about equal to each other
[04:15:12] <two2thehead> maybe it's more effective than we had assumed

[05:29:23] <two2thehead> :p sorry
[05:29:38] <two2thehead> still, the guy has some writing talent : "There are still people saying that, in order to make computer science, one essentially needs a soldering iron; this opinion is shared by logicians who despise computer science and by engineers who despise theoreticians. However, in recent years, the need for a logical study of programmation has become clearer and clearer and the linkage logic-computer-science seems to be irreversible.
[05:29:39] <two2thehead> (i) For computer science, logic is the only way to rationalize ‘bricolage’; for instance, what makes resolution work is not this or that trick, but the fundamental results on sequent calculus. More: if one wants to improve resolution, one has to respect the hidden symmetries of logic. In similar terms, the use of typed systems (e.g., the system F), is a safeguard against errors of various sorts, e.g., loops or bugs. Moreover, in domains wh
[05:29:40] <two2thehead> ere the methodology is a bit hesitating, as in parallelism, logic is here as the only milestone. In some sense, logic plays the same role as the one played by geometry w.r.t. physics: the geometrical frame imposes certain conservation results, for instance, the Stokes formula. The symmetries of logic presumably express deep conservation of information, in forms which have not yet been rightly conceptualized"
[05:29:44] <feep> almost failed my bachelor with that fucking class, fuck linear logic
[05:29:52] <gwern> "Richardson, Chief Justice of the Common Bench at the Assizes at Salisbury in Summer 1631 was assaulted by a prisoner there condemned for felony, who, following his condemnation, threw a brickbat at the said justice that narrowly missed, and for this, an indictment was immediately drawn by Noy against the prisoner and his right hand was cut off and fastened to the gibbet, on which he himself...
[05:29:58] <gwern> ...was immediately hanged in the presence of the Court." <-- I'm not sure proper procedures were followed here
[05:30:52] <feep> two2thehead: the thing is, it's not like theoreticians don't come up with useful things
[05:31:03] <two2thehead> feep, yep
[05:31:09] <feep> but for anything useful, the engineers immediately claw it back and adopt it into like ... a cutesy analogy or some mechanistic understanding
[05:31:18] <meowcat> The soldering iron is needed to bind computer science to physical engineering; but many of the foundations of computer science can be implemented in paper, as ways of organizing files or books or libraries.
[05:31:25] <feep> and it's never like, "wow this really makes me respect theoretical cs"
[05:31:38] <feep> it's just "well, that's just a basic thing, it's just an X, what do you mean someone had to invent that"
[05:31:39] <meowcat> (You can quicksort your bridge hand if you really want to.)
[05:31:44] <feep> like, calling out type theory as a theoretical thing
[05:31:59] <feep> it's just expression coloring in the compiler ... what are you on about ...
[05:32:02] <two2thehead> meowcat, true
[05:32:10] <two2thehead> feep, huh. Okay
[05:32:20] <feep> and I *know* type theory is a theoretical thing
[05:32:33] <feep> but like, you can claw 90% of the useful things *away* from the theoretical context and still have them work
[05:32:46] <feep> in fact, that's how they get popularized.

[05:35:08] <two2thehead> wait, assembly as in the actual 'thing' or assembly code?
[05:35:09] <feep> but it's not like I can't appreciate the theoretical contributions... *intellectually* :p
[05:35:12] <feep> code
[05:35:17] <two2thehead> ah, gotcha
[05:35:30] <feep> it's like, you show me code on paper
[05:35:31] <two2thehead> yeah it's not for everyone, but I can appreciate the necessity
[05:35:31] <meowcat> a card catalog is full of pointers, but dereferencing them has a large constant cost
[05:35:41] <feep> and I'm like, "okay, then that lambda takes another lambda and binds it to a parameter"
[05:35:56] <feep> "... when am I getting a binary out of this?"
[05:36:35] <feep> "so what, is this a stack allocation? is the variable like a dynamic tagged pointer?"
[05:37:03] <meowcat> some of those operations happen to be implemented in hardware on your cpu, but they could be implemented other ways instead.
[05:37:21] <feep> yeah but ... what I'm getting at is, it's like computer science/software development has two bases
[05:37:57] <feep> the computer sciency theoretical lambda calculus/curry-howard/theoretical basis
[05:38:03] <feep> and the like ... "wired together nand gates" basis
[05:38:21] <two2thehead> ah. So haskell programmers vs c programmers?
[05:38:26] <meowcat> quantum mechanics gives rise to semiconductor behavior; logic gives rise to all the proof and computability stuff; linguistics gives us regex and parsers
[05:38:31] <feep> and approximately anything anyone does has to be translated into both bases to gain maximum penetration
[05:39:05] <feep> meowcat: yeah but regex and parsers *are state machines*, and state machines are an intrinsically nandy thing.
[05:39:16] <feep> you have a register of state that you manipulate based on io.
[05:39:19] <meowcat> state machines are an intrinsically proofy thing too
[05:39:22] <feep> even if it's abstracted, engineers understand that.
[05:39:31] <feep> yeah it's one of the areas where both sides are pretty close.
[05:39:38] <meowcat> even if it's implemented, theorists understand that :)
[05:39:53] <feep> I mean ... turing machines look like a hardware engineer was getting into proof work :P
[05:40:06] <meowcat> or a marathon runner was getting into codebreaking
[05:40:11] <feep> :p
[05:40:25] <feep> I mean, like how logical induction looks like an economist is getting into mathematics
[05:40:35] <feep> it's just a fundamentally mechanistic metaphor.

[05:41:07] <meowcat> i mean, at some level we're all interfacing with the same common reality, but we're using various training sets to do it
[05:41:09] <feep> and like, we know now that the particular design of the turing machine was ... like, there's a whole world of systems out there that are turing complete, there's no inherent reason that the initial turing machine had to look like
[05:41:15] <feep> a processor reading a tape and controlling a motor
[05:41:41] <feep> and I mean, I know the theoretical take on that, like, but it's still ... it's a set with five variables, right?
[05:41:47] <meowcat> sure, but that's kind of a metaphor. the motor happens to be useful if your medium is paper tape or magtape, but less so if it's a lookup table like RAM.
[05:41:49] <feep> it doesn't *quite* fit elegantly into the theoretical side.
[05:42:09] <feep> sets with more than three variables are suspicious.
[05:42:19] <feep> anything over four is made by an engineer. :P
[05:42:41] <meowcat> we can imagine an ancient egyptian cleric in a skirt and no shirt who calls out instructions to subservient clerics

[05:43:06] <feep> I'm saying I think the particular metaphor chosen reveals something about turing's disposition

[08:50:43] <Logos01> Something like 70% of the aluminum production in the US is actually from recycling though.  (More than half of which is industrial/machining scrap.)

[09:07:49] <Logos01> So in this case -- that battery gets you the ability to run a current through something, which is at its core all you need to permanently magnetize black/wrought iron.
[09:08:29] <Logos01> Which gives you easy (fcvo easy) magnets, which lets you make electrodynamos which lets you use water or wind mills to produce electricity in larger volumes.

[09:10:43] <Logos01> The challenge there is that salpteter production in this method requires, traditionally 10 months to ferment.

[09:41:00] <Logos01> Apparently since bauxite is actually a sedimentary rock the only real way to harvest it is open pit mines, and it is very prone to producing dust that will contaminate local water supplies.
[09:41:31] <Logos01> So since we don't like that sort of thing here in Ameristan, we instead have the poor offshore peasants harvest their landscapes to feed our ever ravening consumer-materialist needs.
[09:42:02] <Logos01> (We still process bauxite ore here, we just literally ship it in from overseas rather than mine it ourselves, despite there being for example a 275 square mile area in Arkansas that's basically nothing but surface bauxite.)

[10:00:55] <Logos01> ... I get into this from time to time with a friend of mine who is in the "edibles" industry, because he every so often gets on another hemp paper kick.
[10:01:45] <Logos01> And I keep reminding him that yeah sure you can produce more per acre, but you're using immensely more water and fertilizer to do it, and you're also using fossil fuels -- whereas for-purpose silvaculture forestry for paper-making is essentially at worst carbon neutral.
[10:02:26] <Logos01> (It's honestly more likely to be carbon-fixing than not, since thanks to splicing and grafting of the existing trunks to promote rapid regrowth, the trunk system is never harvested and in fact continues to grow over time.)
[10:02:37] <nshepperd2> the nice thing about aluminium is it's a chemical element, so recycling it is really just a matter of seperating the (indestructible) Al atoms from everything else
[10:02:50] <Logos01> Yes.
[10:03:51] <nshepperd2> recycling paper is probably negatively useful since if you just buried it in the ground it would be sequestering carbon

[10:04:20] <Logos01> Not just about sequestering carbon.

[14:51:52] <Robomot> Using Alpine can make Python Docker builds 50× slower (When you’re choosing a base image for your Docker image, Alpine Linux is often recommended. Using Alpine, you’re told, will make your images smaller and speed up your builds. And if you’re using Go that’s reasonable advice. But if you’re using Python, Alpine Linux will quite often: Make your builds much slower. Make your images bigger. …)
[14:52:17] <PapuaHardyNet> I recently installeled alpine linux and I just found out that I can't use it as a daily driver for one reason: I can't run numpy on the damn thing
[14:52:27] <PapuaHardyNet> wait
[14:52:41] <PapuaHardyNet> numpy works, torch cannot be installed
[14:54:16] <PapuaHardyNet> so yeah, in summary I'm sad I can't use alpine linux. It's a really nice operating system
[14:54:26] <rsaarelm> I'm trying to make my old EEE 901 laptop usable and Alpine seems great for that since it looks like it can fit enough stuff on the 4G disk partition to run a graphical desktop environment.
[14:54:43] <rsaarelm> Lot of support dropped for 32 bit linuxes.
[14:55:26] <PapuaHardyNet> yeah, alpine is a joy to use
[14:55:27] <rsaarelm> I got pretty far installing NixOS on it, but ended up stymied by a bunch of 32-bit packages not being found prebuilt on NixOS servers and the laptop not managing to compile some crucial package on the way to getting X.

[19:39:16] <feep> or rather, a different way to look at it, the thing I'm currently doing, where looking up JSONValue inside JSONValue returns a PendingResolutionSymbol
[19:39:25] <feep> is probably logically equivalent?
[19:40:06] <aweinstock> if you're already doing lazy lookups of symbols, then yeah, it might be equivalent
[19:40:23] <feep> yeah
[19:40:37] <feep> the problem is the lazy lookup for JSONValue tries to resolve "what does JSONValue mean" and then you get a loop
[19:41:01] <feep> so what I'm doing rn is sort of ... making the lookup for JSONValue return a symbol that means "this isn't anything rn, but maybe hang on to it and it will be something later"
[19:41:12] <nshepperd> aliases directly referring to themselves feels a little dubious because it's basically defining an infinite type
[19:41:14] <aweinstock> and the compiler actually goes into an infinite loop when trying to do the lookup?
[19:41:18] <feep> yes
[19:41:23] <feep> well, not now that I added an error
[19:41:40] <feep> nshepperd: it's okay because arrays are reference types.
[19:42:05] <feep> so backend emitting S[] doesn't actually need to immediately know anything about S.

[19:42:12] <feep> since it's just {size_t, void*}
[19:42:13] <aweinstock> with isorecursive types, you don't actually traverse into the JSONValue recursively, because it's behind another `Mu` binder, and you only unrolled it 1 depth-unit
[19:42:25] <feep> aweinstock: right, that's logically exactly equivalent

[19:44:14] <aweinstock> I'm not entirely sure it's the same; you're bailing out of the infinite recursion because you're keeping something like a "visited" set in graph search, rather than because a marker in the data tells you to stop recursing
[19:44:25] *** Joins: adiabatic (~adiabatic@user/adiabatic)
[19:44:34] <feep> aweinstock: no, a marker in the data does tell me to stop recursing
[19:44:41] <feep> the marker is "we are already resolving that type rn"
[19:45:06] <aweinstock> which depends on mutating the AST as you're processing it?
[19:45:14] <feep> no, the resolver is a dedicated class
[19:45:19] <feep> I don't mutate AST.
[19:45:44] <feep> like ... the controller class that resolves names to symbols keeps track of what's in progress
[19:46:07] <aweinstock> so the thing that tells you to stop recursing is auxillary data, not a marker in the AST itself (like it is with isorecursive types)
[19:46:10] <feep> yeah
[19:46:24] <nshepperd> i mean, i have an intuition that something called an alias should be expandable into something that doesn't have any aliases
[19:46:37] <feep> part of the design base of this thing is not mutating anything except the actual central compilation state
[19:47:13] <feep> nshepperd: it is, it resolves into (:true | :false | ....... | {the resolved JSONValue object at some later point}[])
[19:47:32] <nshepperd> yeah that's not an actual type you can write though
[19:47:36] <feep> it can be!
[19:47:47] <feep> basically, if the () is the object 'a'
[19:47:56] <feep> this behaves like (:true | :false | ... | a[])
[19:48:20] <feep> nshepperd: in fcc, you'd write this type in closed form as as_type a (:true | ... | a[])

[23:49:57] <kuudes> saturn2, that would cause there to be more competition for the power and better representation
[23:49:59] <Obormot\Arcturus> "These incidents shake people up" ... no fucking shit!!!
[23:50:19] <Obormot\Arcturus> If even one of those things happened here, people would lose their fucking minds
[23:50:25] <kuudes> ie a single person would not hold as much of power, and more stuff would be multiperson bodies
[23:50:52] <Obormot\Arcturus> Nothing remotely like this has ever happened to me or anyone I know, in almost 30 years now of living in NYC
[23:51:02] <kuudes> also either it would get cheaper to run campaign for a position or the total cost of control for the decision body would get more expensive, most likely little of both
[23:51:23] <kuudes> each 1 decision maker would yield less power

[23:54:57] <rmmh> not evidence for it
[23:55:32] <kuudes> well, my point is that over here representative bodies consistently have much larger seat count per population than in usa

[23:55:58] <dbohdan> kuudes: Do you think Europe's safety would degrade significantly with SF-style representation?

[23:56:30] <kuudes> sudden large changes and favoring of extreme policies
[23:56:58] <kuudes> also increase of nonrepresentation
[23:57:25] <kuudes> it is much easier to maintain two party duopoly in politics with lower seat counts
[23:58:09] <kuudes> gerrymandering is a problem, yes, but this is a numerical solution - more districts means gerrymandering becomes harder or more pronounced or both
[23:58:14] <feep> I agree with kuudes
[23:58:32] <feep> mind you, too-large representative bodies can also be a problem
