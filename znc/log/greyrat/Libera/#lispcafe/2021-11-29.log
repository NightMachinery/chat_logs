[06:30:34] <hayley> I get more mediocre results with other REs though. If I just look for [0-9]+x[0-9]+ without quotes, then Rust regex is some 1.8× as fast. But nothing in the RE is any good for SIMD, and using a DFA compiled to machine code should be faster than any VM.
[06:34:06] <gilberth> And why is Rust faster then? Faster than what?
[06:34:32] <hayley> It is somehow faster than one-more-re-nightmare with the branch-heavy DFA code.
[06:34:35] <hayley> https://capiche.com/e/consumer-dev-tools-command-palette POV: you never used Emacs or CLIM
[06:34:50] <hayley> "2007 was quite the year for search." What part of DEFINE-APPLICATION-COMMAND
[06:37:13] <hayley> Still, idk. I know that Hyperscan is supposed to be really clever with picking from multiple string matchers and parallel DFAs, NFAs, etc, but the Rust RE engine is pretty dumb.
[06:39:02] <gilberth> Reminds me that I want a C backend out of curiosity.
[06:39:17] <hayley> "Specifically, the Pike VM executes a DFA implicitly by repeatedly expanding epsilon transitions." Er, so, you run a NFA?
[06:39:39] <gilberth> hayley: Isn't completion even older?
[06:39:47] <hayley> Probably, yeah.
[06:40:51] <gilberth> People don't know their history. That's sad.
[06:41:56] <hayley> So, the Rust regex just has a DFA simulator, a Pike VM implementation, and a full backtracking engine, as well as SIMD search for a prefix byte( or string? idk).
[06:42:20] <gilberth> hayley: What speed does Rust attain looking for [0-9]+x[0-9]. What is it looking at? Chars or octets?
[06:42:45] <hayley> Strings in Rust are UTF-8, but as we are in a branch-heavy DFA, I don't think it should matter.
[06:45:11] <hayley> Okay, it can handle a byte, one substring, an Aho-Corasick machine (so, another DFA :) or some other SIMD string search thingy. But the prefix of [0-9] is a shit choice for SIMDing, since there are a lot of numbers in a log (i.e. timestamps).
[07:05:51] <hayley> So I don't know why it's faster. Only complaint I have with SBCL is all the stupid shifting, but that should still be better than interpretation.

[10:17:06] <moon-child> why do you need to do your comparisons in the unsigned representation?
[10:17:18] <moon-child> signed seems easier, since ascii are all positive
[10:17:33] <hayley> I want to do byte vectors too.
[10:17:49] <moon-child> oh--for non-strings?

[10:19:10] <moon-child> which, aside from the fact that that kind of thing is broken by design, was kind of cool
[10:23:19] <gilberth> Why should it matter what kind of octets I try to match? An octet is an octet, no matter if you stick ASCII in it, which would be completely useless, or UTF-8 octets, or just numbers, either signed or unsigned.

[10:26:19] <moon-child> gilberth: because the simd instruction set has instructions specifically for comparing signed octets

[10:29:57] <moon-child> sure, you can do it.  It's just slightly annoying if you have, say, an alternation which would be a single range in the unsigned representation but which is split in the signed representation
[10:30:59] <gilberth> Tedious, perhaps. But how likely is that when you match text?
[10:31:38] * hayley likes having [0, 2^n)
[10:31:39] <gilberth> Anyhow, the DFA construction couldn't care less.
[10:31:43] <moon-child> not at all; hence my suggestion that it would be fine to work with the signed representation.  But hayley wants to match non-text
[10:33:26] <gilberth> When my machine only has signed octets, but your language wants to name them by unsigned octets, I'd just consider that at the final compilation step.

[18:44:45] <selwyn> didn't seem to do the chernobyl wildlife any harm

[18:48:26] <shka> selwyn: well, red forest was a thing
[18:49:24] <sham1> Well most of the radiation has gone away from Chernobyl. It's mostly just the areas of Pripyat very close to the reactor that's the problem
[18:49:35] <sham1> Some parts are still habitable
[18:50:11] <shka> i mean, most of it is habitable

[18:54:16] <pl> selwyn: wildlife isn't that carefully checked for impact, and well, evolution in operation
[18:54:46] <selwyn> idea is that low doses of radiation can build resiliency to cancer
[18:55:08] <sham1> Radiation caused cancers probably
[18:55:08] <selwyn> low additional doses, i should say
[18:55:43] <pl> selwyn: no, you can't build resiliency to cancer this way, except maybe through strong long term evolution (which is how our existing genetic ECC happened)
[18:56:24] <pl> selwyn: low radiation doses have been (and still are) used to stimulate certain beneficial processes though, under control regime
[18:57:24] <shka> selwyn: i am pro nuclear, but no, radiation is no joke
[18:57:46] <pl> as for chernobyl, the big issue is low-radiation dust covering considerable area in Pripyat city
[18:57:57] <pl> it's not dangerous so long as it's not ingested

[19:33:08] <Alfr> shka, alpha particles can't penetrate most things, even in air they're almost absorbed completely after a few dozen centimeters.

[22:45:44] <selwyn> to be fair the cooling tower does look 'scary'
[22:46:06] <gilberth> Isn't it that coal power stations emit more radioactivity than nuclear power plants? I mean what is escaping that cooling towers? H2_O. Oh! Sure more dangerous than all kind of dust and CO_2.

[22:47:37] <pjb> gilberth: this is actually the single best argument against nuclear energy: people are idiots, so they cannot possibly build and maintain a nuclear power energy industry.
[22:47:39] <gilberth> pjb: Indeed. I still have trouble getting used to that fact.
[22:48:09] <shka> i mean https://i.imgur.com/LWMiIFX.png
[22:48:18] <White_Flame> gotta love how it's called "omnicron" by more people than "omicron", it seems
[22:48:26] <White_Flame> fear teh omnicron corvid
[22:48:28] <gilberth> Oh yeah, or they blow up a nuclear power plant on purpose like Chernobyl.
[22:48:39] <pl> gilberth: most importantly, it's not /escaping/ cooling towers (well, mostly not), it's due to changes in temperature that get vapor into forming into fog
[22:48:39] <shka> gilberth: nuclear power plants DO NOT emit radioactivity 
[22:48:43] <pjb> gilberth: I realized that in the early 80s, when they had a small radiactive leak in a Japanese nuclear power plant, and workers went to wipe and patch it without protection, because they didn't understand it was radioactive: they had idiots as janitors in a nuclear power plant!
[22:48:49] <pl> shka: coal ones do
[22:48:50] <shka> unless not the most widespread kind
[22:48:55] <White_Flame> biden had an address on tv a few hours ago, and both he and fauci called it "omnicron" every single time.
[22:49:00] <shka> pl: yeah
[22:49:06] <gilberth> shka: I am aware, do tell that the public.
[22:49:52] <shka> boiling water reactors can be slightly dirty
[22:49:55] <shka> but that's it
[22:50:12] <White_Flame> yeah, if the water is dirty
[22:50:21] <shka> and yeah, coal is radioactive 
[22:50:24] <pjb> This is basically my life regret: being born amongst idiots.   I recognized it very late.  I thought I was born in a civilisation that was going to space, having watched  Armstrong land on the Moon,  that would have flying cars in 2000, and having read a ton of sci-fi books in my childhood…
[22:50:25] <shka> White_Flame: not what i ment :P
[22:51:09] <White_Flame> I wonder how much coal is left in the earth, as it's truly a "fossil fuel"
[22:51:10] <pjb> Now, if we don't see a lot of aliens, it's probably because they're idiots too.
[22:51:13] <shka> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boiling_water_reactor
[22:51:34] <pjb> White_Flame: IIRC, there's more coal reserves than uranium reserves.
[22:52:02] <White_Flame> pjb: well, the size of reserves in volume isn't that comparable
[22:52:06] <shka> steam turbine can in this type of reactor is actually getting some short lived radionuclide 
[22:52:11] <White_Flame> or weight
[22:52:15] <shka> it's not as bad as it sound :P
[22:52:21] <White_Flame> shka: ah true
[22:52:37] <gilberth> Well my opinion since I was old enough to bother somewhen in the 80s hasn't changed. I rather take the minuscule risk of a nuclear accident over the certain bad effects of coal burning. It was Chernobyl making me thinking about it.
[22:52:50] <shka> also, coal is radioactive, and what is worse? coal ash
[22:52:51] <White_Flame> the funny thing is that uranium is decaying whereas coal really isn't
[22:52:57] <White_Flame> so we need to mine that uranium! ;)
[22:53:00] <pjb> https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/years-of-fossil-fuel-reserves-left  114 years? Seems very low.
[22:53:36] <shka> funny thing is that the main reason behind coal ash radioactivity is the thorium
[22:53:42] <pjb> for uranium, it's 130 years, but at current consumption, which is only 5% of the global energy consumption.
[22:53:46] <shka> which is potential nuclear fuel 
[22:54:08] <shka> pjb: untrue
[22:54:21] *** Quits: x88x88x (~cheeg@gateway/vpn/pia/x88x88x) (Remote host closed the connection)
[22:54:29] <pjb> So actually if we built nuclear power plants to replace Carbon energy, we'd have only 6.5 years of U reserves. Happily, there's Thorium.
[22:54:56] <shka> pjb: ground deposits of uranium are only small portion of the total uranium reserves on Earth
[22:55:01] <White_Flame> and after that, bananas
[22:55:05] <shka> most of Uranium is in the sea water
[22:55:09] <gilberth> White_Flame: Chemical waste has a half life of infinity, too. We happily bury that waste in huge amounts all over the place, yet nobody cares about that, but panics because of the magnitudes smaller amount of nuclear "waste".
[22:55:32] <shka> there is enough of Uranium for centuries to come, even if you are wasting it 
[22:55:45] <White_Flame> I wonder what it would take to make a banana-powered nuclear generator
[22:55:58] <shka> but breeders limit the need for long term waste storage 
[22:56:11] <shka> which is other very important advantage 
[22:56:30] <shka> White_Flame: impossible 
[22:56:33] <gilberth> And coal power plants put their waste into the atmosphere. Nobody demands that coal power plants deposit their waste properly.
[22:56:42] <shka> i mean, obviously
[22:56:53] <pjb> So perhaps we should ask and drive the opposite question.  After all, the great scientists are few and sparse. What let to our scientific and technological civilisation was the open university and the written book, more than the fact that everybody is smart.
[22:56:58] <shka> gilberth: i mean, sure, but we can do better with breeders
[22:57:40] <gilberth> shka: But fast _breeders_ are sure more dangerous! They are fast and breed yet more waste! *gasp* </sarcasm>
[22:57:54] <pjb> So it may be possible to develop and maintain a highly sophisticated technico-scientific society, but hidden and embedded in a larger low-tech population.
[22:58:05] <shka> breeder reactors is not a scientific challenge at this point either
[22:58:11] <shka> it is engineering problem
[22:58:17] <pjb> And perhaps it's possible to extract that core to make a Mars colony with only 1 million people.
[22:59:07] <pjb> The thing is that we don't really know where intelligence comes (even if there are clear genetic factors, and of course environment factors).
[22:59:28] <pjb> There's the proble of the return to the mean IQ in children.
[22:59:30] <shka> gilberth: well, the plutonium and the high enrichment are the real problems...
[22:59:51] <gilberth> What people also aren't aware of is that we have this inefficient design we have, because those plants are designed to produce weapon-grade plutonium. I wonder though, why we did this in Germany as we agreed to have no nuclear weapons.
[23:00:04] <pjb> LOL
[23:00:07] <pjb> because people are idiots.
[23:00:07] <shka> i think this is the sole reason why usa never really  went into that 
[23:00:21] <shka> well, that and the Pakistani fiasco
[23:01:03] <shka> anyway, i am talking to much about the nuclear power 
[23:01:17] <shka> when is Webb finally launching?
[23:01:27] <pjb> Wowbagger, the Infinitely Prolonged
[23:01:39] <shka> 22
[23:01:52] <shka> (fingers crossed)
[23:08:32] <pl> gilberth: the plutonium producing reactors aren't inefficient 
[23:09:05] <pl> LWR/PWR were pushed partly *because* they aren't breeders and require enrichment 
[23:10:40] <pl> Graphite/heavy water moderated reactors take unenriched uranium and spit out plutonium, ong other things, which can be then fed to MOX setups 
[23:11:15] <pl> (and some heavy water reactors will burn close to anything if you feed enough fissile base fuel) 
[23:11:27] <pl> (said fuel includes natural, unenriched uranium) 
[23:12:52] <pl> Light water moderated reactors however need considerable enrichment, and while some can run on MOX fuel, they aren't capable of breeding it well 
[23:14:48] <pl> A lot of early military designs were heavy water or graphite moderated because it made breeding fissile materiał for cores much easier (reduced need to filter for U235)
