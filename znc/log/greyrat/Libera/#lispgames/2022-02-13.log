[15:58:08] <libniwtr> Hi, all, I'm completely new to game programming and I just found out opengl's too hardcore for me. So I want to ask that is SDL sufficient for making sprite-based 2d games? Is cl-sdl2 robust enough for use?
[15:59:39] <|3b|> it should be (to both questions), but most people just use sdl with opengl so the 2d APIs in sdl probably aren't as well tested in cl-sdl2
[16:00:01] <|3b|> and/or might not be as nice to use from CL as they could be
[16:01:46] <libniwtr> As for cl-opengl, I found it hard to follow tutorials like https://learnopengl.com/, because the website uses glfw while the examples in cl-opengl uses glut. Any suggestions?
[16:02:58] <|3b|> https://github.com/3b/learnopengl was my attempt to answer that problem, didn't really succeed, but might still help
[16:03:23] <|3b|> there are cl bindings for glfw though, so you can use those with cl-opengl if you like
[16:03:30] <libniwtr> I also doubt about if it's worthy to learn opengl from ground up today. Maybe it's easier to pick up some mature 3d game engines like unity/u3d?
[16:03:54] <|3b|> cl-opengl examples only use glut because cl-opengl includes glut (and the examples are probably older than the glfw or sdl bindings)
[16:04:14] <libniwtr> That's a good start point! Thanks for pointing that out!
[16:04:15] <|3b|> depends on your goals and interests :)
[16:04:58] <|3b|> if you want to learn 3d programming, and/or need/want lots of control of low-level things for some reason, learning gl or vulkan is good
[16:05:07] <|3b|> if you just want to make a game, maybe less good
[16:05:32] <libniwtr> I would like to start with cl-sdl2 and maybe in the future take a blend of both opengl and sdl2. Is there any projects that uses both cl-opengl and cl-sdl2, for referrence?
[16:05:50] <|3b|> if "use CL" (or some other lisp, to varying degrees), you might be stuck somewhere in between since we don't have anything like unity in CL :/
[16:07:06] <libniwtr> In that case, maybe it'd be a good practice to embed lisp with C++ for game programming :)
[16:07:33] <|3b|> yeah, ease of doing that is one of the things that make it vary for some other lisps :)
[16:08:04] <|3b|> there have been some attempts to do so with ECL to varying degrees of success, not sure how usable any of them are though
[16:09:18] <libniwtr> For me the reason to pick lisp (instead of C++/C#) for learning game programming is that I want to have a taste of true "interactive" game programming. It's very nice to have a repl along side the game window, just my imagination :)
[16:09:52] <borodust> libniwtr: hi, have a look at Sketch (https://github.com/vydd/sketch) or trivial-gamekit (https://github.com/borodust/trivial-gamekit)
[16:10:00] <|3b|> yeah, that's probably a pretty common reason here :)
[16:10:08] <libniwtr> ECL does amazing jobs integrating with Qt.
[16:11:04] <libniwtr> borodust: hi, I have found them in the list of awesome-cl. Will definitely check out them later. Thank you!
[16:11:36] <borodust> libniwtr: i recommend checking them before diving into cl-sdl2 though :D
[16:11:53] <borodust> and if they don't work for you for some reason, then dig into cl-sdl2
[16:12:52] <borodust> CL interactivity is slightly impaired with foreign libraries - sometimes you need to do a couple things here and there to restore communication with FFI libraries into interactive level
[16:13:06] <libniwtr> borodust: Ok but compatibility issue is one of my major considerations. If they worked fine with Lispworks, I'm pretty sure I'll prefer them to cl-sdl2.
[16:13:06] <borodust> gamekit has those here-and-there bits, i expect Sketch too
[16:13:22] <libniwtr> Sounds great!
[16:13:26] <borodust> but cl-sdl2 is more or less direct wrapper to sdl2 so it could be dangerous
[16:13:54] <borodust> oh
[16:14:09] <libniwtr> Yeah I can imagine, programmers should be aware of memory leaks?
[16:14:12] <borodust> i don't think i tested gamekit against lispworks though ;p it might or might not work
[16:14:58] <borodust> libniwtr: well, when dealing with unlispified wrappers/bindings, first thing programmer must be aware is C and how it works
[16:15:07] <borodust> yeah
[16:15:39] <borodust> ppl often jump into cl-sdl2 and cl-opengl and doesn't expect they will need to know how C and CFFI works
[16:16:29] <borodust> cffi is a library that many wrappers use to bind to foreign libraries (shared libraries with C interface)
[16:16:42] <libniwtr> I'll keep that in mind. Thanks for noticing.
[16:17:14] <borodust> should be fun, so do have it and ask questions :D

[17:58:54] <dto> borodust: i am saddened by the reports of build up to war. i am sending best wishes to you and yours, hoping that there can be a peaceful resolution
