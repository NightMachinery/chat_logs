[01:50:15] <omero> does that makes any sense?
[01:50:45] <Nanobot> They actually increased it to 70 years. I'm just exaggerating.
[01:51:19] <omero> it is common sense not to elicit the uneligible
[01:51:25] <Sxem> i doubt i will live to 70. i have no savings
[01:52:21] <omero> meaning this: one cannot be asked what it can not give

[01:56:43] <Sxem> males live to 78 on avg and women to 80
[01:56:58] <Sxem> so they expect you to just have a few years after you retire before you die of old age

[02:20:15] <theholyduck> Sxem: on the other hand the retirement age was generally set lower in an era where people didnt generally live as long  
[02:20:34] <Jigsy> I'm sure the people of today want to abolish the retirement age.
[02:20:42] <theholyduck> Sxem: its not THAT unreasonable to bump it if people are living 10 years olnger than when it was set
[02:20:56] <theholyduck> also in japans case i think its to mitigate their declining workforce
[02:21:04] <theholyduck> because they havent been fucking enough for a while
[02:21:09] <theholyduck> and they dont take in enough imigrants
[02:21:23] <theholyduck> japan is like a decade into population decline every year
[02:21:28] <theholyduck> and its going to get worse
[02:21:45] <Sxem> i was born too early. i wish id been born after robots do 99% of all work
[02:21:54] <theholyduck> many other countries have birthrates as bad as japans. but they take in more imigrants
[02:22:01] <theholyduck> to help offset it
[02:22:50] <Aurora_v_kosmose> theholyduck: Living or surviving?
[02:22:57] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Because bearing with terminal disease is very much the latter.
[02:23:16] <theholyduck> Aurora_v_kosmose:  terminal ilnesses would also generally put you on disability in most countries talking about raising the retirement age
[02:23:58] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Yeah, but fat load of good that'll do you for what time you have left.
[02:25:31] <theholyduck> Aurora_v_kosmose: norway the general age to go out as a pensjoner is 67
[02:25:49] <theholyduck> i dont think 70 is THAT unreasonable if you are having population problems 
[02:26:25] <theholyduck> or money flow problems..
[02:26:32] <theholyduck> like the fucking greeks becomming pensioners at 58...
[02:26:45] <theholyduck> is one of the many many reasons their economy is entirelly fubar
[02:28:09] <theholyduck> norway does allow you to start as early as 62 if you are willing to take less goverment pension payments
[02:28:58] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Part of the reason Japan's workforce is so fucked though is that they provide all the incentives not to start a family.
[02:29:06] <Aurora_v_kosmose> From work culture to expense.
[02:34:36] <theholyduck> Aurora_v_kosmose: and yet. their birth rate isnt actually THAT bad
[02:35:23] <theholyduck> *fertility rate i guess
[02:35:58] <theholyduck> Aurora_v_kosmose: like japan is at 1.360  
[02:36:08] <theholyduck> thats better than a BUNCH of european countries. 
[02:36:26] <theholyduck> its like 50% better than south korea
[02:36:51] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Note that a lot of those countries also provide the same negative incentives, though with less emphasis on insane work culture.
[02:36:59] <Aurora_v_kosmose> (And more on being prohibitively expensive)
[02:38:16] <theholyduck> i mean theres plenty of countries where none of that is really a problem and the rate is still low
[02:38:48] <theholyduck> Aurora_v_kosmose: i think low fertility rate is just a natural part of developed economies and women being part of the workfroce
[02:39:08] <theholyduck> even in countries that provide EXTREME benefits to mothers
[02:39:23] <theholyduck> most people are just fine with having 1 kid and raising it well 
[02:39:27] <Aurora_v_kosmose> theholyduck: That's part of it. But also if you have to work to enjoy any luxury and companies penalize career women who get pregnant (yes they do)...
[02:39:48] <omero> I am bit confused now
[02:39:57] <theholyduck> Aurora_v_kosmose:  oh that definitly IS a thing. norway does something  to avert that last bit
[02:40:05] <theholyduck> by forcing the men to take some of the leave
[02:40:17] <theholyduck> Aurora_v_kosmose:  and these days its pretty normal for the man to take as much time off as the woman does
[02:40:19] <theholyduck> for the kid
[02:40:42] <omero> I am more and more confused now
[02:40:52] <Aurora_v_kosmose> omero: That's normal, you get used to it.
[02:41:00] <theholyduck> heck :P this is anectodal. but the 2 of my cousins who got pregnant the husmand took the majority of the leave to be home with the kid
[02:41:18] <theholyduck> in this part because they were both like really driven journalists. who really wanted to get back to work 
[02:41:26] <theholyduck> where as the fathers just did normal office work
[02:41:33] <omero> thus... help me understand, Aurora_v_kosmose 
[02:41:38] <theholyduck> omero: understand what?
[02:41:58] <theholyduck> Aurora_v_kosmose:  but ofcourse part of this is just starting later 
[02:42:21] <theholyduck> like people basicly dont have kids in their early 20s anymore
[02:42:22] <omero> did I ask theholyduck ?

[02:42:35] <Aurora_v_kosmose> theholyduck: Yeah, basic educational requirements to even get started doing something have been delaying families. Loss of energy from age and lessened fertility impacts then too.
[02:42:38] <theholyduck> omero: i dont think Aurora_v_kosmose can help you understand unless you explain what you are confused about
[02:42:45] <Aurora_v_kosmose> ^
[02:43:08] <Aurora_v_kosmose> I was being tongue-in-cheek replying an implied "confusion about life and existence is normal, you get used to it"
[02:43:23] <theholyduck> Aurora_v_kosmose: but anyways i think all these things are just relativly natural parts of being a developed economy atleast for now. 
[02:43:31] <omero> now. this is a proper answer.. Aurora_v_kosmose 
[02:43:34] <theholyduck> im hoping as automation and stuff happens we can SOMEWHAT reverse this trend
[02:43:53] <theholyduck> Aurora_v_kosmose:  its just all the other countries low on the fertility rate scale. import people from high fertility parts of the world
[02:43:56] <theholyduck> and japan just doesnt
[02:44:26] <Aurora_v_kosmose> theholyduck: Yeah. Naturalization as a citizen there is... pretty much among the most bothersome.
[02:44:26] <theholyduck> Aurora_v_kosmose: like europeans might complain about immigration. but its how we avoid turning into japan
[02:45:07] <omero> thus here it seems proper to answer on behalf of others,
[02:45:58] <omero> |2021-08-28+00:06:58|     omero)) thus... help me understand, Aurora_v_kosmose                                                                                                                                                                                                                    hata           
[02:45:59] <theholyduck> Aurora_v_kosmose:  like we arent even THAT far from the global fertility rate to be under 2 as the world gets wealthier and more "developed"
[02:46:04] <omero> |2021-08-28+00:07:02| theholydu)) omero: understand what?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         heth           
[02:46:36] * Aurora_v_kosmose rolls
[02:47:05] <theholyduck> Aurora_v_kosmose: i imagine as this becomes more of a problem in the future. countries will look into creating a incentive structure to bump the fertility rate. but for now its PROBABLY in the global intrest to have them fall for a while anyway
[02:47:22] <isekaijin> There is an issue with the quality of the people you are importing. There are ways to import relatively high-quality people (like, run PhD programs and encourage good students to come from abroad), but the real problem is that there are only so many high-quality people to begin with.
[02:47:46] <theholyduck> isekaijin:  i mean you SAY that. but most of the people who DO make it out of a war zone and into a european country
[02:47:57] <theholyduck> ARE the highly educated. highly skilled people
[02:48:01] <theholyduck> with resources
[02:48:12] <theholyduck> the largest chunk of refugees move inside the same country
[02:48:18] <theholyduck> the SECOND largest chunk of refugees move 1 country over
[02:48:28] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Leaving everything in a split second and fucking off from your countyr is expensive.
[02:48:30] <theholyduck> by the time you make it all the way to fucking germany. its the figurative 1%
[02:49:03] <theholyduck> and like we generally do that shit inside europe aswell
[02:49:13] <theholyduck> like norway import both tradespeople and specialized people from like poland
[02:49:26] <theholyduck> like most of the dentists i have run into are eastern european for instance
[02:49:32] <theholyduck> and same for plumbers
[02:50:13] <theholyduck> isekaijin:  the problem in part is that many european countries do little to make used  of their specialized skills
[02:50:21] <theholyduck> theres way too many like fucking doctors and PHDs and engineers
[02:50:25] <theholyduck> working as taxi drivers and shit
[02:50:26] <theholyduck> over here
[02:50:29] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Some even intentionally refuse to recognize their education.
[02:50:35] <rando25892> sounds like to omany sellouts
[02:50:42] <rando25892> or is this about refugees?
[02:50:57] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Or go like "provide papers from your uni" "you mean the one that got bombed into oblivion and literally doesn't exist anymore?" "well, sucks to be you doesn't it?"

[02:56:47] <isekaijin> The basic idea should be like ‚Äúwe accept immigrants if and only if they can perform jobs that cannot be performed by locals‚Äù.
[02:58:06] <theholyduck> isekaijin:  meh. doing propper accounting for that is a) really hard and b) uncesary. they will start new buisnesses and juice the economy anyway
[02:58:09] <isekaijin> Otherwise, it is just going to create resentment among the locals. And why should anyone care about the needs of immigrants if the needs of locals have not been addressed first?
[02:58:27] <theholyduck> isekaijin: theres not like theres a fixed number of jobs possible in an area
[02:58:35] <theholyduck> a lot of imigrants are entrepeneurs creating new jobs
[02:59:01] <theholyduck> some of the best resturants around here are founded by and run by recent imigrants for instance
[02:59:03] <Smeef> Functionally, what's the difference between a local and an immigrant?
[02:59:44] <theholyduck> isekaijin: as i said before part of the thing all these imigrants provide is economic growth and activity
[02:59:52] <theholyduck> otherwise we would be like japan 
[02:59:58] <theholyduck> with just deflation year over year
[03:00:00] <theholyduck> and population decline
[03:00:03] <theholyduck> year over year
[03:00:42] <theholyduck> isekaijin:  again the people who make it all the way over to europe are generally the people with the most drive and the most resources anyway. they will create new jobs and new things if they are allowed
[03:00:57] *** Joins: brw (~bas@static.66.39.12.49.clients.your-server.de)
[03:06:38] <isekaijin> At least in the specific case of Japan, what they would have to sacrifice is having, like, a 97% ethnic Japanese population. (Number pulled out of my ass, but I think it should be roughly accurate.) Which they seem to value a lot.
[03:06:45] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Honestly, I'd rather be a warehouse janitor than ever work in a restaurant again.
[03:06:50] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Holy shit service jobs are horrible.

[03:07:52] <S_T_A_N> who woke
[03:08:11] <isekaijin> theholyduck: Maybe what you are saying is that they should value it less. But they genuinely prefer having less people overall to having less Japanese and more of other people to make up the difference.

[03:13:14] <rando25892> the cultures in japan are mostly homogeneous so something to hold onto

[03:16:00] <isekaijin> Besides, it is not just the culture. There is also the ethnic angle. It is similar to Israel from this point of view. You can convert to Judaism all you want, but you are really a Jew if your mom was a Jew, which means that her mom was also a Jew, and so on.
[03:16:55] <theholyduck> isekaijin: and yet. theres so many ethnic varieties and they pulled in imigrants from all over the place 
[03:16:56] <isekaijin> And there is something admirable and worthy of respect about this attitude IMO.
[03:17:21] <theholyduck> a ton of the people serving in the israeli army are first generation imigrants from sub-saharan africa
[03:17:30] <theholyduck> or in previous decades people from behind the iron curtain
[03:17:44] <theholyduck> especially the iron curtain people were often of dubious jewishness
[03:18:04] <theholyduck> and they used people of entirely different countries and ethnicities
[03:18:06] <selfKaiHarness> I have a feeling Japan is more reselient towards woke shit in the west. 
[03:18:22] <theholyduck> to supplement their own lack of population isekaijin 
[03:18:34] <theholyduck> isekaijin: + you are ignoring the large arab population
[03:18:45] <selfKaiHarness> Oh yeah, that too.
[03:18:47] <theholyduck> + they pull in a ton of american imigrants aswell
[03:19:01] <theholyduck> isekaijin: like israel isnt a great example of NOT taking in immigrants
[03:19:20] <theholyduck> and its not a great example of a unified structure because theres definitly a fucking caste system of ethnicities there
[03:19:23] <theholyduck> *unified culture
[03:19:31] <isekaijin> theholyduck: The issue is not so much ‚Äúnot taking immigrants‚Äù, but rather ‚Äúbeing picky with which immigrants you take‚Äù.
[03:19:40] <selfKaiHarness> So i have a question. 
[03:19:41] <theholyduck> isekaijin: the israeli was not even remotely picky
[03:19:56] <theholyduck> isekaijin:  the only requirement was willing to serve in the army for a time
[03:20:11] <selfKaiHarness> Who do you think Japan will survive in the long-term? What are the chances if they don't do anything to address it. 
[03:20:24] <theholyduck> selfKaiHarness:  i mean i doubt its going to collapse or anything. 
[03:20:36] <theholyduck> eventually a) all the "boomers" will die off
[03:21:10] <theholyduck> b) i imagine they will find a way to get people to have more kids. or accept more imigration
[03:21:17] <isekaijin> selfKaiHarness: East Asia is rather densely populated. (Excluding Northeast Asia for rather obvious reasons.) So they are not going to run out of local people anytime soon.
[03:21:45] <theholyduck> isekaijin:  i mean. yo usay that
[03:21:51] <theholyduck> but they are down 1 million people in the last 10 years
[03:21:55] <theholyduck> and the pace is accelerating
[03:21:58] <selfKaiHarness> Simply Put: Japan is very likely going to survive, so i guess is a 81% chance they'll pull through.
[03:21:59] <isekaijin> So there is no demographic existential threat in the near future.
[03:22:17] <selfKaiHarness> That's very good news.
[03:22:25] <Smeef> Before we get around to picking desirable immigrants to take, I say we first determine which undesirable locals to get rid of, you know like the British Empire did when they sent people to Australia, or like Germany did if you want a solution with more... finality... /s
[03:22:34] <theholyduck> isekaijin:  i dont htink they can really solve this by importing "locals"
[03:22:39] <theholyduck> the korean birth rate is worse than the japanese
[03:22:43] <isekaijin> Smeef: haha
[03:22:44] <theholyduck> most of educated china is awell
[03:22:53] <theholyduck> isekaijin:  like they would have to pull in people from indonesia or related
[03:22:55] <dfch> ^
[03:23:03] <dfch> can confirm
[03:23:10] <theholyduck> isekaijin: which. causes these culture issues you want to avoid
[03:23:21] <theholyduck> isekaijin: the solution is to just say to hell with it and import these people anyway
[03:23:34] <selfKaiHarness> China is the worst country in the planet, and Australia (their government went to shit.).
[03:24:03] <selfKaiHarness> So i'm glad countries out there are willing to put up more of a fight like Japan. 
[03:24:08] <theholyduck> + i imagine china will need to start pulling immigrants pretty hard for economic growth
[03:24:20] <theholyduck> selfKaiHarness:  .... 
[03:24:39] <Smeef> I just bought a whole baguette sized garlic bread, it's about 2 feet long and I'm going to sit here and it it all.
[03:24:47] <Smeef> eat it*
[03:25:24] <theholyduck> like china has been sub 2 children per woman for the last 30 years. 
[03:25:35] <dfch> selfKaiHarness, out of curiosity, how young are you?
[03:25:40] <theholyduck> so i imagine they might be swooping up a lot of the potential immigration out of necesity
[03:25:57] <selfKaiHarness> 22 years old. I'm born in 1999, June 23rd. 
[03:25:58] <beaky> Smeef: nice itadakimasu
[03:26:34] <Smeef> beaky, thanks, I worked really hard on it
[03:26:42] <selfKaiHarness> I first watched anime when i was 5 years old back in 2004/2005. Back when Toonami airs anime.

[03:27:47] <dfch> yes
[03:29:43] <isekaijin> theholyduck: China is already way less homogeneous than Japan, if only because of its size. But even if they need to pull people from Southeast Asia (by which I mean actively pull, not just receive them like they already currently do), there are enough ethnic Chinese people in Southeast Asia to pull.
[03:30:25] <selfKaiHarness> My first true anime i watched was (ugh) Toonzai, a saturday anime block in the CW channel. AKA 4Kids (god fucking dammit.). A dubbing company known for its Sonic X censorship. The first anime i watched there was Dragon Ball Z Kai. My god, a love for dragon ball begins.
[03:30:52] <DaPinkOne> 4kids had a lot of shows though
[03:31:50] <selfKaiHarness> Yeah, i agree. That also includes Yu-Gi-Oh, which i also watched.
[03:33:31] <isekaijin> theholyduck: Maybe you are comparing the situation with when Russia (I think under Catherine the Great?) invited the Germans to settle in the Volga, but the situations are not even remotely comparable.

[07:45:20] <amigojapan> Hey ButterNoodle 
[07:45:28] <ButterNoodle> sup
[07:46:06] <ButterNoodle> my company just opened up an engineering lead position out of their tokyo office

[07:46:52] <amigojapan> Ouch ButterNoodle 
[07:47:06] <ButterNoodle> since everything is on the rise here, probably going to stay confined to my basement
[07:47:15] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: Japan is in a huge spike now
[07:47:31] <ButterNoodle> go to the park and ride motorcycle responsibly tho.. 
[07:47:52] <ButterNoodle> yea.. international travel is going to be difficult for a while
[07:49:16] <ButterNoodle> plus the customer I support today accounts for 1/4 of the companies revenue.. and I think it would hurt if I requested to move to another role

[07:53:18] <amigojapan> Ouch
[07:53:48] <ButterNoodle> ik talking with some of my counterparts in japan, they are held to contractual responsibilities pretty well
[07:54:29] <amigojapan> Nice
[07:54:46] <ButterNoodle> could be less stress, or at least I'd know what my expectations are..

[08:40:06] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: Friday sundown to Saturday sundown but yes
[08:40:12] <DunceCotus> is it cause the Sunday worker is trying to gain advantage over most who don't work on Sunday?
[08:40:22] <DunceCotus> or trying to set a precedent of Sunday also being work day?
[08:40:24] <amigojapan> No
[08:40:41] <amigojapan> First of all, it is not Sunday
[08:40:46] <DunceCotus> what?
[08:40:53] <DunceCotus> I'm pretty sure its Sunday in the bible
[08:40:56] <amigojapan> Yeah it is the Sabbath
[08:41:06] <amigojapan> No it is but Sunday
[08:41:09] <DunceCotus> ah right
[08:41:29] <DunceCotus> so what's the reason for the harshness?
[08:41:47] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: then the reason is cause God worked 6 days and rested on the seventh day
[08:41:55] <DunceCotus> to prevent diminishment of sabbath as holy day?
[08:42:08] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: the old testament is harsh all over

[09:11:11] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: its japan
[09:11:17] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: probably cause the old testament was written a very long time ago before or modern sensibilities became a thing. So that is why it seems harsh to you, but it was probably normal back then
[09:11:40] <DunceCotus> your run-of-the-mill daily stonings
[09:11:51] <amigojapan> Yup
[09:12:19] <amigojapan> Romans had run of the mill daily crucifixion
[09:12:52] <DunceCotus> mmm
[09:12:59] <Aurora_v_kosmose> They were kind of messed up
[09:13:14] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: witch hunting was also harsh, but that was not so long ago
[09:13:18] *** Quits: nekodesu (~bit@user/nekobit) (Remote host closed the connection)
[09:13:27] <Aurora_v_kosmose> But then practically every culture condonned basically enslaving half of their population.
[09:13:59] <Aurora_v_kosmose> (Assuming an even gender split)
[09:14:40] <DunceCotus> well we condone basically all the population being enslaved
[09:14:49] <amigojapan> Oh man I hope I don't get heat stroke from waiting for the bus
[09:14:53] <DunceCotus> and don't even call it slavery
[09:15:19] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: fluids.
[09:15:43] <amigojapan> Thanks DunceCotus 
[09:15:55] <Aurora_v_kosmose> DunceCotus: Not exactly. Wageslavery and class warfare is distinct from "women have basically the same rights as your slaves".
[09:16:14] <Aurora_v_kosmose> With others of your peers have more rights than slaves.
[09:16:26] <amigojapan> The bus is late
[09:16:27] <DunceCotus> distinct but not far enough from it
[09:16:59] <Aurora_v_kosmose> DunceCotus: True, and you could've also pointed out I played myself by mentioning class warfare, since it inherently creates a new subordinate class.
[09:17:19] <DunceCotus> we like to think we've come a long way
[09:17:26] <DunceCotus> but in some ways its one step forward, two steps back
[09:17:33] <Aurora_v_kosmose> I'm quite disappointed of that, yes.
[09:17:38] <DunceCotus> Aurora_v_kosmose: I'm not even sure if gender equality is really all that emancipatory
[09:17:52] <amigojapan> Aurora_v_kosmose: I don't think slaves were considered Roman citizens
[09:17:58] <DunceCotus> equality as such is a tool of those in power

[09:35:29] <MootPoot> lol
[09:35:45] <MootPoot> but anyway, I said M$ would change the win11 requirements as soon as a business complains
[09:35:46] <MootPoot> and they did
[09:35:50] <amigojapan> It's also hot as hell
[09:36:04] <MootPoot> you can now install win11 on any computer you want without the TPM requirements IF its a clean install
[09:36:12] <amigojapan> MootPoot: ok I don't remember that
[09:36:28] <amigojapan> MootPoot: they won't require tpm anymore?
[09:36:29] <MootPoot> if you are upgrading from 10-11 then you need to have the cpu and the TPM requirements met
[09:36:41] <MootPoot> amigojapan:  only on a clean install
[09:36:52] <amigojapan> I see
[09:37:11] <MootPoot> I was saying this for like a few days every time the TPM and win11 topic came up
[09:37:26] <MootPoot> and all you of little faith did not believe

[09:38:28] <amigojapan> MootPoot: cool
[09:38:50] <MootPoot> afaik you have to buy a win11 key to get a clean install
[09:39:05] <MootPoot> you only get the free upgrade if you are already running 10
[09:39:14] <MootPoot> but there is no HW limitation
[09:40:05] <theholyduck> sure but its not reccomended or said that its much more likely to just not work
[09:40:10] <theholyduck> on non supported systems
[09:40:19] <theholyduck> which is why they wont offer it as a upgrade
[09:40:32] <theholyduck> if you are stupid enough to install windows 11 on a system that doesnt meet its specs 
[09:40:36] <MootPoot> yeah they posted some stats, someting like 50% of systems under the requirement will *probably* have crashing  issues
[09:40:45] <theholyduck> you are to blame for it going bad
[09:40:56] <MootPoot> but those who do meet it 99.9% are crash free
[09:41:01] <MootPoot> by crash they define as blue screen
[09:41:28] <theholyduck> soo basicly.  it remains the same. just keep using windows 10 for now 
[09:41:28] <Nanobot> "What are you guys doing in those meeting?" "You know, just throwing shit at the wall and seeing what sticks." "Oh man, I wish I could be a fly on the wall."
[09:41:30] <theholyduck> if thats what you have
[09:42:00] <theholyduck> i probably wont upgrade to 11 until either a) the support runs out for 10 or b) im doing ah ardware upgrade 
[09:42:08] <theholyduck> or c) i get a cracking deal on TPM support on my computer
[09:42:23] <theholyduck> i have a compatible cpu for windows 11. but i dont THINK i have a tpm module. i honestly havent checked
[09:42:34] <MootPoot> I've been trying to explain here that anybody who has a win10 system that cant be upgraded most likely will change their computer out anyway before 2025 anyway

[09:43:36] <MootPoot> oh, you dont need a TPM then
[09:43:45] <MootPoot> you can toggle the firmware TPM on your mobo

[09:44:31] <theholyduck> i guess im set
[09:44:36] <theholyduck> i never bothered looking too much into it
[09:44:39] <MootPoot> no, only if you have a cpu without a fTPM feature
[09:44:49] <MootPoot> so afaik 7th gen intel and 1st gen ryzen and before
[09:45:24] <MootPoot> Its amusingly how coincidental this is
[09:45:38] <MootPoot> but I wrote a academic research paper and had a presentation on TPM 2.0

[09:45:53] <MootPoot> the knowlege came in handy nwo

[09:46:48] <amigojapan> MootPoot you said anyone, I am someone and I am not buying a new system
[09:47:04] <MootPoot> and nobody is making you buy a new one
[09:47:11] <MootPoot> which was my point exactly
[09:47:13] <amigojapan> Ok
[09:47:32] <MootPoot> you and others were saying that microsoft was making you buy a new system through the win11 requirements

[10:13:03] <MootPoot> I just need anybody who can give me code work for an intenrship
[10:13:12] <Sadale> MootPoot, aww
[10:13:16] <MootPoot> my govt will even give them a 75% subsidy on my wage
[10:13:42] <Aurora_v_kosmose> JS is a bad choice what with underscore.js being popular.
[10:13:47] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Or is it still?
[10:13:50] <MootPoot> so techically they can pay me like 3.75 CDN an hour
[10:13:56] <Aurora_v_kosmose> I know they started integrating its stuff into mainline at some point.
[10:13:58] <MootPoot> and the govt will bring it up to min wage

[10:14:37] <Sadale> MootPoot, I've no idea on the market of Canada. But if you wish to work in Hong Kong SAR, China tho, I might be able to help you to contact those employment agencies here. :P

[10:15:02] <Sadale> AFAIK, it's seller's market here. And some companies do welcome fresh graduates.
[10:15:17] <MootPoot> I'll have to ask
[10:15:32] <MootPoot> but the 75% subsidy only applies to canadian companies I think
[10:15:41] <Sadale> With those political shit going on here tho. Most western people may not want to work here. Personally I'm ok with that tho. I don't do politics.
[10:16:16] <MootPoot> I don't mind politics

[10:18:11] <Sadale> MootPoot, As of the situation today chances are that you won't get arrested here in Hong Kong SAR, China.
[10:19:14] <Sadale> MootPoot, My first hand experience is that the situation here in Hong Kong is nowhere as bad as those western media protrayed. Just don't do politics excessively and you'll be fine.
[10:19:45] <MootPoot> I don't do social media and I don't talk politics aside from friends
[10:19:48] <Sadale> Example of actions that'd get you arrested includes constantly posting anti-China shit on social media, joining anti-China activisms, etc.
[10:19:50] <MootPoot> I guess I should be fine 
[10:20:10] <MootPoot> I do occasionally make communism jokes but that's just in private groups 
[10:20:18] <Sadale> yep. You're probably fine. I've seen a few people that doesn't quite like our motherland as well. The talk shit about our country verbally from time to time. And they're doing fine.
[10:20:24] <MootPoot> Or anonymous global ones like this chat 
[10:21:16] <Sadale> In fact, as far as I know, even if you're doing that in public you'd still probably be safe. As long as you aren't intentionally doing it in a way that makes you look like that you're an extremist and you're advocating anti-China movement. I joke about capitalism and communism all of the time as well. I'm doing fine.
[10:22:08] <Sadale> BTW, capitalism is evil. :P

[14:45:22] <amigojapan> MootPoot: well on an iPhone it's not usb-c
[14:45:43] <MootPoot> I guess, it is a limitation but the amount of times I've needed to charge and plug in headphones at the same so rare it's not really an issue
[14:45:56] <MootPoot> Any time I'm charging my phone I just have a PC to swtich to 
[14:46:28] <MootPoot> I remember maybe one time I needed to do that in the last few years

[15:00:36] <MootPoot> amigojapan:  for other interesting data points, also from statistica, companies usually replace their phones every 2.5 or so years, and personal people do it every 3.5 or so years
[15:01:08] <MootPoot> although you probably replace your phone once every decade lol
[15:01:47] <amigojapan> Ahorita MootPoot but I did it in like 7 years
[15:02:10] <MootPoot> most phones I have I end up driving them into the ground after about 2.5 years or so
[15:02:33] <amigojapan> MootPoot: I wood have done it later if the phone was not forcing me out with the apps being deprecated
[15:02:40] <MootPoot> my last phone's antenna died on me after 2 or so years

[15:04:29] <amigojapan> What
[15:04:58] <MootPoot> idk about japan, but here, USUALLY the cost of the battery replacement is so high from the manufacturer, either if you get your own battery its okay, otherwide they price it high enough that it just makes more sense to get a new phone
[15:05:02] <MootPoot> its dumb

[15:05:36] <amigojapan> I see, I will ask the price then
[15:06:14] <MootPoot> Its worse when the company you are buying from isen't that good at dealing with end users
[15:06:22] <MootPoot> and mainly deal with enterprise
[15:06:37] <MootPoot> like toshiba, lg, etc
[15:06:40] <amigojapan> I see

[15:07:01] <MootPoot> My current phone is still going fine, its almost a whole year old now
[15:07:40] <MootPoot> amigojapan:  when my toshiba HDD failed I had to send it across the entire country; they promised a replacement but then it took them 3 months of no contact and then they just sent me a prepaid visa card of the sticker price I paid for the drive
[15:07:47] <MootPoot> It was a toshiba X300
[15:08:23] <amigojapan> HMmm guess it sucks in Canada
[15:08:45] <MootPoot> the drive cost 105 dollars, it cost me like 20 to send it to toshiba lol

[15:09:50] <MootPoot> speaking of, I have to send my swiss army knife to get warrentied

[15:11:49] <MootPoot> lol no
[15:11:56] <MootPoot> they have a warrenty  center here in ontario
[15:11:57] <amigojapan> Ah ok
[15:12:16] <MootPoot> but they make you send them the processing fees as a cheque 
[15:12:24] <MootPoot> which is annoying, I dont have a checkbook
[15:13:21] <amigojapan> MootPoot: don't know in Canada, but my bank said they can make a single check if I need it. They don't do check books
[15:14:48] <amigojapan> MootPoot: I was so fortunate to change my travelers checks before there was no other way to do it
[15:15:42] <amigojapan> MootPoot: they should call people to warn them if they are discontinuing a service

[17:56:34] <KatrinValerie> Knowing x86_64 assembly can be very useful for debugging binary software or reverseengineering
[17:56:46] <Sadale> KatrinValerie, oh true.
[17:56:56] <KatrinValerie> You could also use it to build a bootloader
[17:57:03] <KatrinValerie> or a basic OS if you are crazy
[17:57:12] <Sadale> Anyway if you really want to do x86 assembly, go ahead. What I could tell you is that if you plan to develop stuffs from scratch, it has very limited use albeit it sounds cool to others if you know it. :3
[17:57:28] <KatrinValerie> Don't become the next TempleOS guy pls.
[17:57:55] <omero> Sadale: those are wise words you wrote.
[17:57:55] <Berlin36> what is TempleOS
[17:58:03] <Sadale> For reverse engineering tho. It'd be helpful. Or for optimizing programs, it's be gelpful as well. Except that most programmers wouldn't have to do this kind of task.
[17:58:08] <amigojapan> Temple OS was awesome tho
[17:58:27] <KatrinValerie> A single user operating system programmed by a schizophrenic genius programmer.
[17:58:28] <Sadale> amigojapan had interacted with the person behind temple OS on freenode before he died
[17:58:30] <amigojapan> Berlin36: someone that made his own OS
[17:58:39] <amigojapan> Yup
[17:58:40] <KatrinValerie> His story is rather tragic
[17:58:42] <amigojapan> I did
[17:58:53] <Berlin36> well yeah, learning reversing is one of my goals too
[17:59:14] <KatrinValerie> Berlin36: you can drop straight into that and learn asm as you go really
[17:59:24] <KatrinValerie> once you have the most common instructions down
[17:59:24] <Berlin36> i see
[17:59:25] <Sxem> i programmed in assembly on my vic 20
[17:59:48] <KatrinValerie> or if you can programm C you could use a disassembler that translates asm to C
[17:59:55] <omero> Berlin36: as a matter of fact, reversing would amount of rediscovering hot water 
[18:00:33] <omero> or reinventing the wheel ;)
[18:00:40] <KatrinValerie> Berlin36: With reverseengineering you mostly need to learn a toolchain and some basic methods to approach binary software
[18:01:02] <amigojapan> Sxem: in the Vic 20 it makes much sense

[18:06:21] <Sadale> KatrinValerie, Seriously, I think I'll redesign my website that'd include more anti-capitalism elements on it.
[18:06:53] <Sadale> KatrinValerie, not exactly anti-capitalism. It's more like telling others that I'm fed up with capitalism and I just want to be less involved in it. I've got no intention to protest against it or anything.
[18:06:55] <Berlin36> TempleOS (formerly J Operating System, LoseThos, and SparrowOS) is a biblical-themed lightweight operating system (OS) designed to be the Third Temple prophesied in the Bible. It was created by American programmer Terry A. Davis, who developed it alone over the course of a decade after a series of manic episodes that he later described as a revelation from God.
[18:07:10] <Berlin36> um lol

[18:14:42] <Sadale> And how people'd figure out that it's him who's died in train crash
[18:14:51] <Berlin36> haha there is C, and there is C++
[18:14:56] <Berlin36> but he invented...

[18:23:58] <omero> btw, scent and taste can be artificially be generated directly interfacing with some advanced electronics

[18:25:29] <Sadale> omero, what did you mean?
[18:25:30] <amigojapan> Sadale: I have heard that when you smell something, some of the atoms of the object have actually entered your nose

[18:25:59] <amigojapan> Right
[18:26:02] <Sadale> or could you? :P
[18:26:03] <omero> btw, smell is one of the most 'persistent' kind of memory your brain can recall
[18:26:29] <omero> taste is the 2nd most persistent kind

[18:26:48] <omero> or 2nd last
[18:26:55] <amigojapan> Sadale: I think the way I would do it is have done fragrances and expose them when the video has a cue for it

[18:27:13] <Sadale> amigojapan, but that'd be consumable.

[18:46:59] <davic> Sadale: AMD master race
[18:47:05] <davic> fuck intel
[18:47:05] <Sadale> davic++
[18:47:09] <DunceCotus> Berlin36: this is. Sparta.
[18:47:09] <davic> and fuck nvidia
[18:47:09] <Sadale> davic, lol right
[18:47:11] <Bco1981> Sadale: actually i think i heard that ddr5 mobo's wouldn't be ready for next gen
[18:47:18] <Sadale> Bco1981, really?
[18:47:20] <davic> Sadale: AMD best, linux support of doom
[18:47:29] <Bco1981> again from the gigabyte hack
[18:47:46] <davic> Sadale: sadly I only have my macbook now, but looking at buying Steam Deck
[18:47:47] <Sadale> Bco1981, anyway my mobo won't support 6000 series
[18:47:54] <Bco1981> nope :)
[18:47:55] <Sadale> davic, boo
[18:47:59] <Bco1981> need AM5 socket
[18:48:03] <Sadale> exactly :(
[18:48:13] <Sadale> And I suppose AM5 means DDR5
[18:48:19] <omero> guys... I will state here and now. I make a point to maintain and keep working on obsolete systems and architectures because it never gets boring.
[18:48:29] <Sadale> well, it's k tho. I don't need a CPU that's that powerful
[18:48:37] <davic> Sadale: get an EPYC
[18:48:42] <omero> I also enjoy anime for the very same reason.
[18:48:50] <Sadale> davic, you should have gifted yours to me :(
[18:48:50] <Sadale> davic, you should have gifted yours to me :(
[18:48:57] <Sadale> don't just throw yours away ;_;
[18:49:12] <Bco1981> omero: obsolete as in ?
[18:49:21] <omero> its a constant exploration, Bco1981 
[18:49:36] <Sadale> omero historian :34
[18:49:39] * Bco1981 pulls out his 486 dx4 120mhz with whooping 64MB of ram
[18:49:45] <omero> I can relate back to the very 1st generation of available architectures
[18:49:58] <Bco1981> and incredible 850MB HDD's
[18:50:08] <omero> for consumers? nahhh... I can relate back to earlier times.
[18:50:20] <omero> it has been a long journey indeed
[18:50:46] <Sadale> punch card
[18:51:02] <omero> electromechanics? yes.
[18:51:11] <omero> I worked on some of those systems
[18:51:50] <omero> some of the names I only know in their native form. and it is not english :P
[18:51:56] <Sadale> wow. electromechanics. That's very old
[18:52:03] <Berlin36> pulls out his rgb gay colored keyboard and fan, a 8k ultra fucking wide monitor, and a gamer mouse, a 13337ghz cpu with 128 gb ram
[18:52:17] <Berlin36> 128tb ram*
[18:53:01] <Sadale> I wonder if human civilization would collapse before we get to the point that we'd get 128TB of RAM.
[18:53:06] <Berlin36> gay colored like every key cap contains a Billy Harrington portret kn it
[18:53:19] <Sadale> civilization in the history comes and goes, unfortunately. :(
[18:53:31] <Sadale> And now we're having a global civilization
[18:53:40] <omero> Sadale: when I started, we were working with 'magnetic nucleii memory matrix' to store information
[18:53:54] <Berlin36> at that point, people might use something different than what we call ram today
[18:53:59] <Sadale> omero, this? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic-core_memory
[18:53:59] <ImoutoBot> [title] Magnetic-core memory - Wikipedia
[18:54:18] <omero> let me check that.
[18:54:39] <Sadale> Berlin36, maybe those rich people would pay people for using part of their human brain as RAM. :(
[18:55:12] <Berlin36> wh-
[18:55:20] <Berlin36> this sounds like a sci fi film
[18:55:39] <omero> yes, Sadale .. that article is pretty much accurate
[18:55:41] <Berlin36> where simple poor people try and fight the rich ones
[18:55:51] <omero> but also ... very modern
[18:56:09] <omero> some terms are debatable
[18:56:14] <Sadale> omero, if you wouldn't mind me to ask, how old are you?
[18:56:25] <omero> but still... convey the concept. the principle
[18:56:29] <Sadale> It sounds like that you know those technologies years ago.
[18:56:50] <omero> I worked on some of the projects, yes...
[18:57:06] <omero> I am a ... mechanic.
[18:57:08] <Sadale> omero, Back in the days there were barely any people who're lucky enough to have access to advanced technology like this.
[18:57:23] <Berlin36> yeah sadale
[18:57:26] <Sadale> ah :3
[18:57:45] <omero> I am not old, Sadale ... I joke about this... but I prefer the term... ancient :D
[18:58:00] <Sadale> hello ancient omero :3
[18:58:09] <Sadale> I'm ancient in some sense as well that I'm using IRC :p
[18:58:11] <omero> I thought to change my nick to dyno at some point
[18:58:25] <Berlin36> why tho
[18:58:26] <Sadale> Those stupid kids just use discord :P
[18:58:27] <omero> but that would just ... be wrong
[18:58:38] <Berlin36> D¬°sCarD
[18:58:50] <Berlin36> irc = big pp
[18:59:00] <Sadale> discord = tiny pp then?
[18:59:14] <Berlin36> yes
[18:59:18] <Sadale> lolololol
[18:59:20] <omero> talk. we used talk.
[18:59:32] <Berlin36> paper
[18:59:34] <Berlin36> take it or leave it
[18:59:39] <omero> in the beginning there was nothing else :)
[19:00:09] <Sadale> stone
[19:00:12] <omero> and yes. paper was a good thing
[19:00:22] <Berlin36> it still is
[19:00:22] <omero> naaa... clay?
[19:00:23] <Sadale> inscribing runes onto stone tablets
[19:00:30] <Berlin36> oof
[19:00:31] <omero> ebla
[19:00:44] <Berlin36> ebla?
[19:00:44] <omero> one of the least known libraries of the past
[19:00:51] <Sadale> ebola
[19:00:56] <omero> no. ebla.
[19:00:56] <Berlin36> ebalo
[19:01:08] <Sadale> yes ebola
[19:01:12] <Berlin36> yes
[19:01:19] <omero> it was a city with a big library that stored thousands of clay tablets
[19:01:26] <Berlin36> that seems cool
[19:01:30] <Berlin36> was it in a desert?
[19:01:32] <omero> what preserved the tablets?
[19:01:33] <Sadale> cool! :3
[19:01:35] <omero> a big fire
[19:01:37] <Berlin36> like in the avatar aang series
[19:01:42] <omero> it just baked the tabled
[19:01:46] <omero> tablets

[19:02:07] <omero> preserving them instead of destroying them
[19:02:08] <Berlin36> (or is it leafes)
[19:02:35] <Berlin36> yes, leaves

[19:09:24] <Berlin36> xD
[19:09:54] <omero> it all depends how volatile you want your message to be ;)
[19:09:56] <Berlin36> it's a bit dark, seems it's gonna rain soon :(
[19:10:25] <Berlin36> i wanted to go out for a walk
[19:10:53] <omero> havent seen a drop of rain here in weeks... probably couple months... Im longing for rain, the land demands it too
[19:11:13] <Berlin36> oh it's okay, gonna be just cloudy, without rain
[19:11:21] <Berlin36> wow omero
[19:11:33] <Berlin36> it's been raining a lot here 
[19:12:42] <omero> it is quite unusual we go this long without a shower :D
[19:12:47] <Berlin36> btw i was thinking today about a really interesting project i'd like to mske in future
[19:12:53] <Berlin36> i see omero
[19:13:39] <Berlin36> well basically i want to log the weather for everyday, every hour in my city
[19:13:46] <Berlin36> then make statistics
[19:13:49] <omero> ok, a bit misworded but I meant to say just that. we havent seen a drop of water from above in a long period
[19:13:53] <omero> it is bad
[19:15:32] <Berlin36> i wanna parse the temperature, humidity and wind speed for every hour in the day, and also if it is raining or sunny or cloudy or whatever
[19:15:59] <Berlin36> i know many sites already have that data, but it would be cool to exercise and make a database of my own
