[10:38:28] <sheep> that sounds like a security risk
[10:38:35] <jim> yeah
[10:38:47] <sheep> wouldn;t that reveal what users' passwords are for other accounts if they confuse which password they use for their ssh account?
[10:38:56] <jim> so it "shouldn't" be possible, or at least shouldn't be noe
[10:38:59] <jim> done
[10:39:28] <selckin> thats why you have pub/private keys, so leaking the 'password'/public key is fine
[10:39:32] <sheep> if you're worried about bruteforcing passwords, either ban password auth and require public keys, or use something like pam_cracklib to require users' passwords to meet complexity requirements

[17:07:57] <BinarySavior> hi i'm trying to use xdotool to type "test" into a gedit window without activating the window, here is my command: https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/G324Tw55DX/
[17:08:47] <BinarySavior> my DE is ubuntu:GNOME
[17:09:07] <Psi-Jack> So, just Gnome. 🙂

[17:09:45] <BinarySavior> but if I type in there windowactivate --sync then it will activate the gedit window and "test" will appear there in the window
[17:09:59] <Psi-Jack> Yeah, that's generally how it works.

[19:39:31] <peetaur> koollman: yeah that's the problem...the only way it works is to say path, but then some thing gets added or renamed, and surprise, all your IO and network performance is eaten until you fix it

[21:56:38] <BCMM> peetaur: interesting. do our IRC clients have the same nick colour algorithm?
[21:56:57] <BCMM> huh, so konversation's colours are deterministic, somehow?
[21:57:05] <BCMM> i need more data
[21:57:20] <Rakko> ah, I found the references to a.b.c.d and e.f.g.h in /etc/rsyslog.d/99-local.conf
[21:57:31] <peetaur> BCMM: I'm using konversation.... long ago I thought it seemed like people with same length names had differnet colors as much as possible, and it would somehow remember and keep them the same
[21:57:50] <peetaur> but often I see some bad contrast ones with same color and length so I have to look closer to tell them apart
[21:57:57] <peetaur> closer = more than 0 seconds
[21:58:14] <BCMM> confirmation bias because it's particularly annoying when two people have the same nick length and colour, perhaps?
[21:58:20] <BCMM> i mean, that's usually when i confuse people
[21:58:25] <Dagmar> I can think of two general approaches that would result in the same behaviour, neither of which would require storing anything
[21:58:42] <BCMM> you could basically just hash the nick
[21:58:42] <Dagmar> One is much more of a PITA than the other
[21:58:47] <Dagmar> That right there.
[21:58:51] <Dagmar> That's the clear winner
[21:59:18] <Dagmar> Hash the nick and and then use the most-significant bytes to index a palette
[21:59:24] <peetaur> oh colored nicks is just a list of 8 colors I can change... with 8 you obviously would have lots the same, and it's easy to change to fit a mostly-dark theme (I failed previously to make a proper dark theme)
[21:59:30] <BCMM> i never noticed that it's consistent over time, so i guess i imagined it was just selecting randomly

[21:59:46] <Dagmar> The other would be to hash the nick and then attempt to use a graduate-student level topology formula like is used with maps to color the nicks
[21:59:54] <BCMM> really needs to be more than 8, imho
[22:00:10] <peetaur> there...changed it...now it looks exactly the same. :|

[22:01:29] <peetaur> yeah between sessions doesn't matter, but in same window or some time interval would be bad
[22:02:03] <BCMM> i guess you wouldn't want somebody who parts and rejoins to change colour either, so the deterministic approach is probably best

[22:13:49] <Dagmar> I've got a somewhat terrifying to behold set of perl and shell scripts operating behind an sshd that keeps them all synched up with completely _custom_ packages, but that means I also have to explicitly push a custom package just to update a debian/raspbian package

[22:15:53] <patiencezero> Debian's primary customers are server owners/maintainers. Anyone who does sysadmin work wants a stable release cycle to avoid the constant breaking of things.

[22:30:56] <powerhouse_> I am using GNOME and have a second monitor that is physically vertical.  Thy mouse goes to the vertical screen but when I go to the vertical monitor the mouse goes down when I move the mouse right.  So this is inverted.  Is there a way to change this so the mouse goes to the vertical monitor in a right left motion as if the vertical monitor was horizontal?
[22:31:14] <Dagmar> Yes, there's even a GNOME configuration tool for that

[22:42:28] <yogoyo> you can install openvpn on most vps hosters. the configuration is not trivial but there are tutorials
[22:42:39] <omero> do we really need a vpn? in some cases, the answer is yes. but in general ... why bother?
[22:42:41] <peetaur> Lutin: do you know what FORWARD is for... eg. if let's say you had a "guest" wifi hotspot and wanted to share that to your guests, and they can only see your internal dns server but not your file server, you could add a rule in FORWARD for that. So on your gateway that has a valid route to the dns and also the fileserver will only allow what you whitelisted, and you -j DROP the rest.

[22:46:26] <patiencezero> Kyv, its not a conspiracy. US and other countries have been running shell-based honeypots since the cold war era. Why do you think they would stop doing such a thing with the advent of the internet?
[22:46:58] <patiencezero> Especially when you customer base pays for operating costs. All you have to do is provide initial capital and it runs itself. As a program manager, it's a no brainer
[22:46:58] <BCMM> omero: explaining the concept of using a vpn as an actual v p n, i.e. for securely accessing your LAN from a remote location, has become extremely difficult now that every youtube video ends with an ad for that other VPN use-case

[22:50:35] <peetaur> if it's infeasibly expensive, then you're getting something out of it ... even if it's just 2 years safe due to improved computers, vulnerabilities found (and recorded 2 year old data on a warehouse in Utah)
[22:50:43] <omero> I never considered the idea, jessicara
[22:50:46] <jessicara> so really all you would need is a very small tool to watch packets are the correct place
[22:50:49] <Sauvin> My VPN just hides my IP.
[22:50:54] <jessicara> tcpdump already exists

[23:48:21] <BCMM> pyzozord: well under the circumstances, the solution is simply to install a package which satisfies it. some people create an empty package just to do that.

[23:48:52] <BCMM> pyzozord: the most "correct" thing would probably be to actually build st as a debian package

[23:49:09] <akik> hkm: you can reset the situation with "nmcli conn delete your_ssid"
[23:49:18] <BCMM> pyzozord: which isn't as hard as it sounds, since it's already packaged in debian/ubuntu
[23:49:21] <akik> hkm: then redo it with the three commands
[23:49:27] <akik> hkm: oh hey, progress!
[23:49:31] <hkm> ok bet!
[23:49:52] <BCMM> pyzozord: you'd just be downloading the source package, making whatever config changes prompted you to compile it in the first place, and then running one command to make the whole thing build and package itself

[23:50:35] <pyzozord> BCMM: it looks like the official st repo doesn't have scripts to build a debian package
[23:50:39] <BCMM> pyzozord: iirc, there's a program specifically to create fake packages that provide other packages. i just can't remember it's name
[23:50:40] <akik> hkm: i put the commands again here: https://pastebin.com/raw/z9kFa9Xf

[23:51:11] <hkm> cool thanks :)  akik
[23:51:28] <BCMM> pyzozord: i mean, it's actually in debian. and all packages in debian include a "source package", that can be used to automatically build the package
