[00:10:57] <MootPoot> bleh
[00:11:02] <MootPoot> I got  another interview call
[00:11:07] <MootPoot> its from ANOTHER bitcoin place
[00:11:08] <MootPoot> jeez
[00:11:27] <JesseDesu2> u r popular
[00:11:50] <MootPoot> I guess
[00:12:34] <JesseDesu2> i need rest
[00:12:39] <JesseDesu2> been up 20 hours
[00:12:43] <MootPoot> I didn't know so many people want a piece of my meat
[00:13:05] <JesseDesu2> all these fiends want teenage meat
[00:13:21] <JesseDesu2> hmm
[00:13:32] <JesseDesu2> thats the only the distillers lyrics i can remember
[00:17:23] <Fenderbassist> MootPoot: good luck on the interviews, hope you find what you're looking for
[00:23:06] <MootPoot> I might have to drive into work - but if they give me like a decent salary
[00:23:11] <MootPoot> maybe 50-60k
[00:23:35] <Fenderbassist> would be a nice start
[00:23:57] <Fenderbassist> once you're working, should be easier to find better offers in time
[00:24:14] <Fenderbassist> get raises via changes if they offer crap after a year or two
[00:27:03] <MootPoot> right now I make 30k as a intern
[00:27:16] <Fenderbassist> oh so they did end up paying you
[00:27:18] <Fenderbassist> good
[00:27:32] <Fenderbassist> you can negotiate a better salary on new offers
[00:27:41] <Fenderbassist> rinse and repeat every couple years or so
[00:27:53] <Fenderbassist> build a resume that will get you the offers you want
[00:28:01] <MootPoot> until you hit 100 or 115k then you do what
[00:28:25] <Fenderbassist> depends on your specialization I guess
[00:29:08] <Fenderbassist> in 7 years, my son went from a dollar above minimum wage doing data entry while learning programming to 200k a year doing programming, changed jobs 3x
[00:29:35] <MootPoot> damn
[00:29:39] <MootPoot> how do you hit 200k anyway
[00:29:40] <Fenderbassist> was promoted in each company due to his willingness to go the extra mile vs his lazy co workers who did the minimum
[00:29:54] <Fenderbassist> made his managers / supervisors look good, became a Go To guy
[00:30:11] <Fenderbassist> too valuable to lose (for a while, until they did)
[00:30:44] <Fenderbassist> example, when he was a teen he loved hacking on phones, doing custom ROMS and so forth, I always made sure he had phones to play with
[00:30:58] <Fenderbassist> then in 2nd company he made a phone app for them, the only guy in the entire company that could
[00:31:01] <Fenderbassist> instant promotion and raise
[00:31:12] <Fenderbassist> things like that
[00:31:32] <Fenderbassist> he likes the work and it shows
[00:31:48] <Fenderbassist> it cost him a lot of his free time but that's an investment into his future
[00:32:19] <Jigsy> I fucking hate January.
[00:32:27] <MootPoot> I guess once you hit 200k then you're good
[00:32:28] <Fenderbassist> every 2 years he would change companies and get a lot more salary as a reult
[00:32:31] <MootPoot> or even 150k or so
[00:32:34] <Fenderbassist> result*
[00:32:46] <Fenderbassist> now he's negotiating with another company for more
[00:32:58] <Fenderbassist> because he has experience
[00:32:59] <Bco1981> Jigsy: why?
[00:33:05] <Jigsy> It's a shitty month.
[00:33:11] <Jigsy> With no redeeming qualities whatsoever.
[00:33:18] <Bco1981> sales ?

[00:41:25] <MootPoot> I think I only have like 5k left to pay
[00:41:32] <MootPoot> and I'm not even out of uni yet
[00:41:52] <Fenderbassist> that's quite good
[00:42:54] <MootPoot> I could pay it all off within the next 2 months but I need the cash , not sure how long I'll be without a job

[03:17:52] <Fenderbassist> Cryowolf: making a lap desk?
[03:17:56] <Fenderbassist> those are pretty neat
[03:18:23] <Cryowolf> no something more intricate
[03:18:38] <Fenderbassist> an armature that swings over on the bed?
[03:18:51] <Fenderbassist> that would be very cool
[03:18:56] <Cryowolf> no I thought about that but it wont work
[03:18:58] <Fenderbassist> movable surface
[03:19:01] <Fenderbassist> ah bummer :(
[03:20:03] <Cryowolf> I thought about a rolling desk that starts as the bed frame near the feet, then you fold it down. Move up its length and roll it towards where you lie down or sit
[03:20:21] <Fenderbassist> that's creative
[03:20:34] <Fenderbassist> nice idea
[03:20:47] <Cryowolf> I thought about drilling an aluminium frame to the sides so I can add it around it
[03:21:01] <Cryowolf> like a train or rollercoaster
[03:21:05] <Cryowolf> with tiny rubber wheels
[03:21:13] <Cryowolf> or old in line wheels I have
[03:21:30] <MootPoot> Sex desk 
[03:21:36] <mixfix41> I would some quality wheels with bearings for the turning and the rolling
[03:21:36] <MootPoot> Sex sling
[03:21:58] <MootPoot> I want to try a sex sling solo
[03:22:16] <Cryowolf> just need them bottom and top since the aluminium frame (or wood frame) would have the nudges /carve-outs
[03:22:28] <Cryowolf> mixfix41, I have some older in-line ballbearings
[03:22:31] <MootPoot> it'll be like fapping on a carnival ride
[03:22:32] <Cryowolf> forgot what theyre called
[03:23:18] <Cryowolf> the desk doesnt need quality bearings, since you just move it down and attach it to the leg
[03:23:42] <mixfix41> thats true im only saying what i would do
[03:24:00] <Cryowolf> now if I just want it on one side, I would need it to be hellt very strongly
[03:24:22] <Cryowolf> otherwise I'm back to the fold out thing
[03:25:35] <Cryowolf> which would start on its side along the frame, you rotate it up, then you move it upwards (using those things you have in drawers, I'll recycle them) until you reach the point where you drop it down towards you
[03:26:08] <Cryowolf> adjusting the height but obviously needing some pretty strong support underneath, that's also very thin
[03:26:47] <Cryowolf> the material would need to be light weight, probably cork with hard wood thin plate

[03:37:20] <Cryowolf> S_T_A_N. I got diagnosed with a cancer where the tumor was 29x18cms, 11kgs. With the kind of cancer (MPNST) and the size of the tumor, my chances of survival were estimate at less than 1 in 100,000. I had the 11kg tumor removed along with my spleen, my appendix. A third of my large inestine, half my stomach sack, a third of my pancrea and a bunch of nerves. The surgery was a success, there was no sign of vascularization so metastasis 
[03:37:20] <Cryowolf> risk was down. I went into p re-emptive and precautionary strong chemo for 18 weeks and then I was finally over 50% of survival at 55%. Now, I'm at 60ish% chance of survival
[03:38:01] <Cryowolf> so you tell me, can it get worse? Other than death
[03:38:08] <S_T_A_N> Yes it can
[03:38:16] <S_T_A_N> It can always get worse
[03:38:47] <Cryowolf> with this cancer it's either tumor is surgically removed, or you die
[03:38:58] <Cryowolf> chemo is only for cells after successful surgery
[03:39:07] <Fenderbassist> Cryowolf: I am very happy to hear of your successful surgery
[03:39:35] <Cryowolf> Fenderbassist, thank you, that was the first step ;D

[06:01:32] <sentionics> just got Windows Terminal set up to use my Cmder startup scripts. Once I've got it setup to open new tabs in the same directory as the current tab, I'll be where I need to be to finally switch off of Cmder.
[06:02:29] <sentionics> In Cmder, this was an issue easily resolved, but Windows Terminal doesn't enjoy the same advantages Conemu has I guess.
[06:03:30] <sentionics> Apparently the solution is to have a character sequence prepended to all shell prompts. A small price to pay I guess.

[18:22:07] <emmeka> well, wine is very particular and highly variable.

[18:23:07] <Bco1981> you shouldn't sex your gun...
[18:23:16] <MootPoot> same with alcohol - "drink this if ur classy and educated"  - no, you just want to get buzzed like the white trailer trash you see on the roadside 
[18:23:51] <emmeka> MootPoot the thing with wine is that everyone has very different tastes in it, tastes you acquire based on cultural background and exposure to it, and learning what you like and how to know what wines you will like is a process.
[18:24:36] <emmeka> wine tastes different depending on region, soil, variety, age it was picked at, bottling process, age of the wine after bottling, year...
[18:25:03] <MootPoot> half of my problems with things are just people not admitting what it is and instead choosing to make their own fantasy lore for it to rationalize it
[18:25:16] <emmeka> you're wrong about this, though.
[18:25:20] <MootPoot> sure
[18:25:25] * MootPoot pats emmeka 
[18:25:28] <Sxem> i dont like carbonation, or the taste of alcohol, so all wine sucks to me. liqueur is better. its usually just 30 proof, so not too harsh, has lots of sugar. no carbonation
[18:25:45] <emmeka> people don't just drink wine to get drunk, otherwise they'd drink anything. sure, there are plenty of people who get loaded on cheap bottom shelf box wine because whatever.
[18:25:46] <Sxem> 80 proof is too harsh
[18:26:22] <Sxem> wine is 10-30 proof
[18:26:41] <emmeka> but you, never having tried it, seem not to believe that wine can taste good and that people can have preferences in it and enjoy it besides the fact that it gets you drunk. That people will have like 1 glass of wine for the taste of it.
[18:26:52] <emmeka> 30 proof? that's basically brandy
[18:27:06] <Sxem> fortified wines go up to 50 proof

[18:27:39] <MootPoot> >seem not to believe that wine can taste good and that people can have preferences in it and enjoy it 
[18:27:40] <emmeka> sure, port wine or whatever, but that hardly counts
[18:27:41] <darkwitch> proof is bullshit
[18:27:52] <Sxem> ive never tried fortified wine
[18:27:52] <MootPoot> when did I say anything that suggested the opposite - stop making up my words
[18:28:02] <darkwitch> use percent like civilized people
[18:28:13] <emmeka> <MootPoot> same with alcohol - "drink this if ur classy and educated"  - no, you just want to get buzzed
[18:28:20] <emmeka> this is not why most people drink wine
[18:28:27] <emmeka> but maybe you should try it, before disparaging it
[18:28:55] <MootPoot> ehh - my own experiences from my circles disagree but I dont have any numbers for you
[18:29:02] <emmeka> not that that's your typical behaviour. usual MootPoot MO is to not understand a thing, and then criticize it anyway
[18:29:10] <emmeka> you just said your own circle doesn't drink at all
[18:29:22] <MootPoot> well - should specify
[18:29:31] <MootPoot> current circle* 
[18:29:46] <MootPoot> my pre-covid circle when I went to uni in person was different
[18:29:53] <Sxem> if you try to freeze wine, it will explode
[18:30:01] <Sxem> there will be glass everywhere
[18:30:27] <emmeka> I grew up in a wine region, actually, and I find I prefer wines from that area. Not because they're objectively better, but because they're what shaped my tastes.
[18:31:01] <MootPoot> emmeka: but its amsuing how you always label your experience as the correct real one and then dismiss mine for being entirely derived from a misunderstanding
[18:31:02] <MootPoot> but ok
[18:31:08] <MootPoot> I guess that's your MO 
[18:31:18] <MootPoot> :3
[18:31:19] <emmeka> but you prefaced this by stating that you had zero experience of it, so
[18:32:09] <MootPoot> my experience dosent limit iself to the things I've done myself to my own body - I dont have to shoot myself in the face to know its a bad expereince 
[18:32:21] <MootPoot> after seeing somebody else shoot themselves in the face in real time in person
[18:32:23] <MootPoot> etc
[18:32:38] <emmeka> ok, well then you should acknowledge that almost all of humanity for almost all of the history of civilization has enjoyed wine.
[18:32:42] * MootPoot has had to drag multiple drunk people from bars to home
[18:33:10] <MootPoot> emmeka: almost all for almost all sounds a bit might 
[18:33:12] <MootPoot> much
[18:33:22] <MootPoot> more like the places that could grow it 
[18:33:29] <MootPoot> or the few rich fucks that could afford it
[18:33:38] <emmeka> and yet it is true. for a liberal definition of "wine". fruit based liquor is basically universal.
[18:33:53] <MootPoot> wine isen't exlcusively from grapes?
[18:33:55] <emmeka> and no, wine underpinned whole civilizations, and was drank by everyone. even slaves.
[18:34:02] <Sapphirus> I'm the odd ball who doesn't like alcoholic beverages.
[18:34:04] <emmeka> the slaves of ancient Rome were given pomace wine
[18:34:16] <Bco1981> !g apple wine
[18:34:18] <ImoutoBot> Bco1981: Apple Wine | Total Wine & More <https://www.totalwine.com/theme/apple-wine> | Homemade Apple Wine - Practical Self Reliance <https://practicalselfreliance.com/apple-wine/> | Make Hard Cider & Apple Wine - WineMakerMag.com <https://winemakermag.com/article/1513-make-hard-cider-apple-wine>
[18:34:38] <Bco1981> nice, Make Hard Cider & Apple Wine
[18:34:58] <MootPoot> but sure, if thats your nitpick I'll agree with you
[18:35:02] <emmeka> MootPoot depends who you ask. A purist would say that wine is the product that comes from Vitis vinifera, the European grape. A more liberal definition would include the other grape species, such as the fox grape and the muscadine. And a more generalist view would include all fermentation-based fruit alcoholic drinks.
[18:35:06] <MootPoot> some people can enjoy wine for just the enjoyment of it 
[18:35:38] <MootPoot> although I fail to see how that's particularly different from enjoying the alcohol in it - 0% wine is not really  popular 
[18:35:45] <Bco1981> my parents make a mix of vodka, strawberries and sugar... it's dangerous. extremly dangerous.
[18:36:04] <emmeka> Bco1981 lol
[18:36:09] <Bco1981> tastes like stawberry juice and hits like a mofo
[18:36:16] <emmeka> sugary alcohol is a bad idea
[18:36:41] <MootPoot> people in my family do weed on occasion though
[18:36:43] <emmeka> all those 14 year old girls pounding back those sugary bottled vodka drinks that taste like friggin freezies
[18:36:46] <Bco1981> the problem is that i tastes good, and hardly taste like there is any alcohol in it.
[18:36:54] <emmeka> and it just rots your gut
[18:36:54] <Bco1981> seriously dangerous
[18:37:02] <MootPoot> although fortunately they just say it straight - that they wanna get buzzed
[18:37:04] <Bco1981> it tastes*
[18:37:26] <emmeka> MootPoot alcohol is a part of the experience of wine, but you don't drink it to get drunk
[18:37:34] <MootPoot> ....
[18:37:35] <emmeka> or well, you can, and many do
[18:37:42] <emmeka> but this is not the usual use case
[18:37:45] <MootPoot> ......
[18:37:55] <Bco1981> MootPoot: some don't... drink it to get drunk
[18:38:20] <MootPoot> alchol is part of the experience of wine.  People drink wine for the experience rather then getting buzzed.
[18:38:23] <MootPoot> .......
[18:38:24] <emmeka> when you have a glass of wine with dinner the objective isn't to get wasted while eating steak or whatever
[18:38:43] <emmeka> it pairs well. but the alcohol is a part of that. it's a holistic kind of thing.
[18:38:57] <MootPoot> bullshitto
[18:39:05] <emmeka> and this is where you're wrong.
[18:39:20] <MootPoot> if alcohol is integral to the experience - you are drinking it on some level to get buzzed, no matter how lightly
[18:39:56] <emmeka> in the same way one eats chocolate because it has caffeine?
[18:39:58] <MootPoot> I'm not under the illusion that everyone wants to get blackout drunk all the time 
[18:40:54] <MootPoot> but if the fundamental experience cannot be had without the alcohol in there...well.
[18:41:24] <emmeka> that's a good comparison, I guess. The caffeine is integral to the experience of the chocolate. But it's not the whole of it by any means. Most people eating chocolate aren't just looking for an infusion of sugar and caffeine to perk them up, though chocolate achieves this. They're enjoying it.
[18:42:33] <Bco1981> enjoying... it... more like an addiction.
[18:42:34] <MootPoot> every person in my pre-rona group who gave me this shit were always included in the group of drunk idiots I had to drag back home - and blased on wine 
[18:42:37] <emmeka> or a cup of good tea. most people aren't drinking a nice green tea because it has caffeine and they want to get caffeinated. They're enjoying it. It has complex flavours which they like.
[18:43:22] <emmeka> MootPoot are you under the impression that most adults who drink are alcoholics
[18:43:48] <MootPoot> no
[18:44:01] <MootPoot> alcholics are different from wanting to get buzzed
[18:45:02] <MootPoot> emmeka: although I have a little issue with that comparison with chocolate and caffiene - I would agree if like every bar of chocolate had like 200mg or something of caffiene in it 
[18:45:13] <MootPoot> enough to actually make an effect on most people
[18:45:23] <emmeka> well, we can go with the tea one instead if you want.
[18:45:45] <MootPoot> same deal with tea, the amount of caffine in tea is not enough to make that comparison useful
[18:45:59] <emmeka> that's hardly true
[18:46:13] <emmeka> but anyway. it's just sort of depressing to me. your vision of something like wine is "nasty juice people force down to get a buzz, and then lie to themselves because they won't admit they just wanna be drunk"
[18:46:40] <MootPoot> when a few drinks are already down the hatch - thats what they say
[18:46:45] * MootPoot shrugs
[18:47:16] <MootPoot> I know of one person who's like you say, but everyone else tells me this bullshit
[18:47:16] <emmeka> sure, you can do this. you can drink to get drunk and at a certain point it all just goes down and doesn't matter. but this isn't how it's usually used.
[18:47:53] <MootPoot> they start with the whole spiel about wine then 2 drinks later switch to hard liquor once the inhibitions are down
[18:48:59] <MootPoot> currently my experiences of people who are like you say and who are like how I say are ....  1 in your favour and about 8 otherwise
[18:49:12] <emmeka> yeah but your experiences of this are at parties

[21:14:24] <MootPoot> I wonder if that would make it brute force proof
[21:14:27] <KuudereNoises> it'd be extremely effective at keeping people from reading your data

[21:15:15] <JesseDesu> where is the download
[21:15:17] <MootPoot> random password generators on both sides, but they have the same key/seed value so they both make the same output with the same key
[21:15:36] <MootPoot> except the key is not the whole key , its the key+current time
[21:15:43] <KuudereNoises> JesseDesu: the idea is it's a method for rolling dice to generate secure passwords
[21:15:47] <MootPoot> so every min there is a new passwords

[21:17:31] <KuudereNoises> it's much more secure than either "password" "admin" or "12345"
[21:17:33] <KuudereNoises> so that's pretty good!

[22:29:09] <Fenderbassist> SummerSkies: yes that is different, the picture of the album is cool as well
[22:29:09] <Bco1981> idk, i haven't had much need for transferring... yet
[22:29:57] <Bco1981> but they suck now in dk because you can hardly have a saving in the bank then you have to pay interest for having money, in their stinking bank.

[23:08:35] <ButterNoodle> whiskey
[23:08:44] <JesseDesu> exploding spears i bet
[23:08:51] <JesseDesu> you need a round that explodes
[23:09:06] * ButterNoodle thinks about all the times his spear has exploded in a whale
[23:09:16] <JesseDesu> an anti tank round
[23:09:20] <JesseDesu> HEAT round
[23:09:52] <Fenderbassist> agree on the .44 as minimum for bear, better to carry a rifle as primary if you're going to bear country
[23:10:03] * ButterNoodle hears over the coms - H EEE FOLLOW WILLIE P, SHAKE AND BAKE
[23:10:05] <JesseDesu> i wonder if anyone has ever torpedo'ed a whale
[23:10:38] <JesseDesu> like, actual torpedo and actual whale
[23:10:48] <ButterNoodle> its probably happened
[23:11:17] <JesseDesu> did japan have subs in ww2
[23:11:34] <ButterNoodle> Fenderbassist: yea idk what a good guide gun would be.. stepping up from a 44mag in pistol
[23:11:52] <JesseDesu> all that whale meat probably had exploded shards in it tho
[23:11:54] <ButterNoodle> I mean if I'm already carrying 500 mag in a snubbie
[23:12:14] <ButterNoodle> 45/70 is still a great round
[23:12:26] <Fenderbassist> was just gonna say
[23:12:34] <Fenderbassist> Marlin Guide Gun in .45-70 gov
[23:12:38] <Fenderbassist> for bear country
[23:12:45] <ButterNoodle> I still want the 1895 SBL that pratt used in jurassic world
[23:12:55] <Fenderbassist> yeah I bet lol

[23:13:17] <Bco1981> JesseDesu: pretty sure i saw some discovery program years ago about the pearl habor bombing, they had some tiny 2 man sub
[23:13:22] <ButterNoodle> they are all movie guns tho
[23:13:27] <Fenderbassist> imfdb (internet movie firearm database) website very helpful for id'ing guns in film

[23:14:45] * MootPoot cuddles with his cz 75
[23:14:46] <JesseDesu> jerico is israeli
[23:14:53] <JesseDesu> spike spiegel used one
[23:14:55] <Fenderbassist> type in a web search for Cowboy Bebop Guns and the imfdb should come up in results
