[00:17:40] <physikoi> hello #javascript. Is it possible to search for elements that have both a given class and given (partial) text content?
[00:18:27] <physikoi> EG, find all the elements with the class "special-button-class" with text content that includes "delete me"
[00:18:58] <RLa> you could first find all with the class and then check if textContent on them contains the text
[00:19:45] <physikoi> RLa: yeah, i'm doing that with a loop. Just wondering if it's possible to do it with a single native function. IE with querySelectorAll()

[03:25:35] <ljharb> cthulchu: TTFB isn't enough

[03:26:22] <ljharb> cthulchu: if the first byte gets there fast but interaction doesn't work for awhile, then optimizing for TTFB is worse than nothing, because it could be actively harming when interactivity kicks in
[03:26:53] <ljharb> but also as systemfault says, it's highly unlikely that optimizing for TTFB will hurt. it's just that it's also highly likely it won't solve your actual problems.

[08:01:52] <devslash> I am fixing a bug in my Angular application but I have a bug that I don't think is specific to Angular, more of a general html issue. I have an input field that has a date. The data is fetched from an API and returns the date in the format "10/24/2021". I checked this by testing the raw data of the API result in my browser. I am binding the data field to the startDate field from the API. When I set type="date" the field shows up empty. If I change
[08:01:52] <devslash> it to type="text" it binds correctly

[08:44:23] <incognito> in brief, how to repaint the simplest way possible
[08:44:37] <systemfault> incognito: Why would an image change on the backend?
[08:44:48] <ThePendulum> incognito: by setting the src to the same path except with a query parameter added

[08:45:09] <incognito> loading image then real image
[08:45:17] <ThePendulum> the browser will ignore cache and the server will ignore the parameter

[12:03:46] <Assault> hi. when one does this   <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/mystyles.css?v=1">  what is the v=1 for and how does one utilize it in the css?
[12:07:22] <pupskuchen> it might be to avoid caching issues when deploying a new version of the css
[12:07:36] <pupskuchen> you don't use it in the css
[12:07:37] <Assault> or better yet, when doing the same for JS like <script src="js/scripts.js?v=1"></script>
[12:07:48] <Assault> how is that "v" param then accessed?
[12:07:58] <Assault> this app seems to be made with jQuery...
[12:08:15] <pupskuchen> I don't think it's meant to be accessed
[12:08:43] *** Quits: DnzAtWrk (~DnzAtWrk@mobile-access-6df0d5-193.dhcp.inet.fi) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[12:08:47] <pupskuchen> you could inspect the dom with JS, but other than that I don't think there's a (useful) way
[12:09:03] <Assault> ah ok so its only for the end users browser so it knows to reload the JS or CSS
[12:10:09] <OhTheCode> i think somewhere locally, when it grabs the mystyles.css, the browser records that it's version 1, if the html changes to ?v=1.1, it knows to grab the new css file. That's what I'm thinking
[12:10:14] <OhTheCode> i'm reading this article - i'm just reading this article - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3466989/what-does-appending-v-1-to-css-and-javascript-urls-in-link-and-script-tags-do
[12:11:36] <OhTheCode> so if the html file has ?v=1, then you open the html file again and it still has ?v=1, the browser knows not to download it again if it's already cached
[12:12:10] *** Quits: Ilyu (~quassel@gateway/vpn/pia/ilyu) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[12:13:26] <pupskuchen> the browser just matches the full resource URL and checks if it has something cached for that. if a query parameter changes, it won't be able to match the old/cached URL
[12:13:26] <OhTheCode> yeah, i think the browser keeps the query string with the file name, so it can distinguish the version of the same file name

[15:01:41] <fweht>  i have this project where i create webgl shaders to create cute little effects on behind some words on the page...  so the shaders are only something like 20x100 pixels or so...  i read somewhere that people recommend creating a full screen shader and only 'draw' in the intended area, is this really a better solution?

[20:56:12] <ljharb> you can use `$.load` but that's a really weird thing to want to do

[21:19:07] <austincheney> one exception is if you are on a php server without something like Node you can use php to dynamically build a javascript file (with .php extension for PHP) and send it to the browser with mime type text/javascript and the browser will execute that php file as JS
[21:19:23] <ljharb> that is not an exception
[21:19:27] <ljharb> doing that is horrifically terrible
[21:19:32] <ljharb> never dynamically build a JS file.
[21:19:38] <ljharb> !server data
[21:19:38] <jellobot> ljharb, There's 3 options to properly get data from the server to the client: 1) fetch request from JS. 2) HTML data-* attributes, read them in JS. 3) <script type="application/json"></script>, read and parse it from JS, however this option requires special escaping of </script> in the json body. Never generate/template JS on the fly. See also !fetch
[21:19:43] <austincheney> using php at all is horrifically terrible, but use what you got
[21:19:46] <ljharb> ^ that is the only way you should bring dynamism

[22:58:52] <sheetjs> the levenshteun distance is 3

[23:00:03] <stenno> i am doing something wrong
[23:00:53] <stenno> hitler has a levinshtein distance of 6 to trump
[23:02:29] <systemfault> Same from stenno </troll>
[23:02:36] <systemfault> 10 from systemfault though
[23:02:47] <stenno> true
[23:06:05] <ljharb> assigning arbitrary meaning to levenshtein distance is the same kind of magical thinking as assigning arbitrary meaning to numbers
[23:06:49] <sheetjs> considering that levenshtein distances are in fact numbers, assigning arbitrary meaning to levenshtein distance is a special case of assigning arbitrary meaning to numbers
[23:06:58] <stenno> er i hope you know that we are super joking with this shit
[23:07:33] <stenno> we are not actually deriving degrees of faschism from the levenshtein distance of our names to hitler
[23:07:43] <ljharb> sheetjs: lol fair
[23:07:52] <ljharb> stenno: lol yes, i do know that
[23:08:01] <sheetjs> from a CS perspective, it's mildly amusing, but it's better to move away from that topic

[23:08:06] <stenno> fair
[23:08:16] <sheetjs> for the same reason there's a push away from lenna

[23:09:26] <ljharb> sheetjs: what is "lenna"
[23:10:07] <sheetjs> a picture from Playboy that was used as a test image in the world of image processing
[23:10:14] <sheetjs> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenna
[23:11:00] <sheetjs> its usage is terrible for a number of reasons
[23:11:11] <systemfault> (Like what?) I seriously don't know...
[23:11:15] <qswz> lenna is close to .. oops let's not
[23:11:20] <systemfault> lerna?

[23:11:45] <stenno> hitler..?
[23:11:45] <sheetjs> forgetting the subject matter of the actual test image
[23:11:46] <stenno> ah
[23:11:50] <systemfault> To be honest, from that article... I'd be more angry if I had the photographer's last name..
[23:12:21] <sheetjs> there
[23:12:32] <stenno> dwight hooker is a great name for a playboy photographer
[23:12:33] <sheetjs> is no way to reproduce the test image or even describe the controls
[23:12:34] <qswz> haha
[23:12:53] <qswz> or for a react hook specialist
[23:12:56] <sheetjs> The engineers tore away the top third of the centerfold so they could wrap it around the drum of their Muirhead wirephoto scanner, which they had outfitted with analog-to-digital converters (one each for the red, green, and blue channels) and a Hewlett Packard 2100 minicomputer. The Muirhead had a fixed resolution of 100 lines per inch and the engineers wanted a 512×512 image, so they limited the scan to the top 5.12 inches of the picture,
[23:12:56] <sheetjs>  effectively cropping it at the subject's shoulders.
[23:13:04] <sheetjs> so many uncontrolled variables
[23:13:34] <qswz> where is the uncensored lenna?
[23:13:37] <ljharb> sheetjs: um, ok - that seems like a huge nonsequitur
[23:13:56] <stenno> twight hooker will always use useEffect correctly
[23:14:14] <stenno> only person in the world who is able to do that
[23:14:26] <ljharb> anyways i don't think it's reasonable to assume people in general have critical thinking skills, based on the last decade of politics and also covid response
[23:14:34] <ljharb> which is why i clarified :-)
[23:14:37] <sheetjs> while there is mild technical interest in levenshtein distances, there is no need to use "hitler" as a string
[23:14:54] <systemfault> qswz: According to wikipedia... november 1972's edition of that magazine
[23:15:08] <systemfault> sheetjs: Let's use sheetjs instead!
[23:15:19] <systemfault> Or "JavaScript"
[23:15:24] <qswz> yea I manage to, just an average woman
[23:16:01] <qswz> I mean, not an average 2021 woman, where 50% people are obese
