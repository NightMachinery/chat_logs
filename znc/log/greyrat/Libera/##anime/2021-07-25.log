[03:01:15] <theholyduck> emmeka: i mean that article is also a debunking of why 24bit is more than you need unless you are re-mastering/re-encoding the audio 
[03:01:22] <theholyduck> and that 16 bit is transparent
[03:01:31] <theholyduck> as long as you dont re-encode it
[03:01:56] <emmeka> it is more than you need, I don't think anyone ever has listened to a CD and thought "this audio quality is terrible", and CDs are 16 bit 44.1khz.
[03:01:59] <theholyduck> and the video delves deeper into that 
[03:02:24] <theholyduck> showing that infact the noise floor on 16bit is so low  that when propperly dithered it might as well not be there
[03:02:36] <emmeka> but it is, at least, *detectable* to compare 16 bit and 24 bit audio. Imo, it's very difficult to discern the differences in audio sampling rates even with very high end equipment.
[03:03:03] <theholyduck> emmeka: i mean yeah you can look at the noise floor with a spectrum analyser sensitive enough

[04:10:39] <MootPoot> emmeka: the issue is not the bitrate of the sound file, it's more of dedicated DACs do it better 
[04:11:17] <MootPoot> From a technical perspective a 150cc scooter can get you everywhere you wanna go, but it's nicer in a sedan 
[04:11:19] <MootPoot> Same idea 
[04:11:21] <emmeka> MootPoot your PC *is* a dedicated DAC
[04:11:54] <mixfix41> yeah a gaming mobo is better than a usb mobo
[04:11:58] <MootPoot> emmeka my PC has a little 2 dollar dac chip on it from a bargain basement maker 
[04:12:07] <MootPoot> Amongst the 50000 other things it does 
[04:12:09] <mixfix41> you buiy a dac and you turn on a shitty mobo you got rip off
[04:12:17] <MootPoot> It is not dedicated by any means
[04:12:17] <emmeka> it just depends what the hardware is actually capable of, for example, running that command on my wife's laptop shows it is quite capable of 192khz DAC all on its own
[04:12:45] <MootPoot> Bitrate ≠ accuracy of reproduction
[04:13:02] *** Joins: ntdll (ntdll@user/ntdll)
[04:13:08] <MootPoot> I can make any cable transfer data at 9 trillion baud technically
[04:13:15] <mixfix41> its sound the same is also true for display computers can display the whole spectrum while humans cant interpret that much
[04:14:03] <emmeka> sure, but basically any hardware today should be high quality provided it is actually capable of handling those inputs, like theholyduck analog to digital audio conversion is something we've been able to do well since forever
[04:14:22] <emmeka> especially when you're dealing with line level audio
[04:14:24] <mixfix41> theres a difference with a dac but its a very argument to take on so its peculiar to even experience this type of fanaticism
[04:14:46] <mixfix41> you seriously have some really bad IEM or something
[04:14:48] <theholyduck> mixfix41: i mean a computer display very much cant display the whole spectrum
[04:14:49] <theholyduck> though :P
[04:14:56] <emmeka> sure, maybe your PC's amp isn't perfect, but you don't need a DAC to fix that
[04:14:56] <mixfix41> some monitors suck
[04:15:26] <theholyduck> MootPoot:  im not saying you cant get some audio improvement by buying a 10 dollar usb soundcard
[04:15:29] <theholyduck> or whatever
[04:15:38] <theholyduck> motherboard line level ports tends to be a bit noisy
[04:15:47] <MootPoot> Listen l, I'm not preaching like you need a dac or else 
[04:15:48] <theholyduck> the dac itself is fine its just the general electrical noise
[04:15:58] <mixfix41> but its digital imaging processing so its not like the image file isnt getting process so thats what counts
[04:16:04] <theholyduck> my argument is that 70-100-200 dollar dacs is just pointless
[04:16:19] <theholyduck> a 10 dollar one is allready transparent
[04:16:38] <MootPoot> theholyduck: sure, but tbh at that price range you're getting a dac and an amp in one 
[04:17:03] <MootPoot> The motherboard may be lacking one... but it's very definitely lacking the other 
[04:17:27] <theholyduck> meh all the audiophiles buy seperate dacs and amplifiers
[04:17:39] <MootPoot> Its JesseDesu 
[04:17:39] <theholyduck> which is sort of what i asumed mixfix41 did since he bought a 75 dollar dac
[04:17:54] <theholyduck> not a 75 dollar external audio device
[04:17:57] <MootPoot> Mixfix didn't buy any dac afaik
[04:18:08] <theholyduck> er
[04:18:08] <MootPoot> He's just being going on about how his IEMs are the best thing in the world 
[04:18:10] <theholyduck> they are both yellow

[04:18:24] <MootPoot> theholyduck: colorblind duck
[04:18:31] <theholyduck> i mean they are literally both yellow

[04:18:47] <theholyduck> i figured it was same yellow person
[04:18:49] <MootPoot> And that there's no point of anything else other then just throwing all your money in IEMs

[04:19:42] <mixfix41> you have work in software to take hold of advantages yet you fiddle with hating money and buying unproven hardware which to the naked eye is not worth buying
[04:20:05] <MootPoot> Lol
[04:20:20] <emmeka> he's right, though
[04:20:25] <MootPoot> Unproven = mixfix41 hasent tried it 
[04:20:27] <mixfix41> yea a dac gets less use than a 10-15 dollar eye candy shrapnel speaker
[04:20:36] <emmeka> your DAC is useless if your software is doing everything in 48khz
[04:20:45] <MootPoot> Brb food 
[04:20:51] <mixfix41> its culture  but there are those who know and those who consume things dont hate money dood
[04:21:16] <emmeka> like cool... it can accurately reproduce high sample/bit rates... this is pointless if your PC isn't actually giving it this
[04:21:34] <theholyduck> its bit-depth
[04:21:34] <theholyduck> :P
[04:21:43] <theholyduck> sample rate. bit depth
[04:21:44] <theholyduck> :D
[04:21:49] <mixfix41> no
[04:21:49] <emmeka> sample rates/bit depths, whatever
[04:21:56] <theholyduck> mixfix41: bit-rate is a third thing
[04:21:56] <theholyduck> :P
[04:22:05] <mixfix41> the biggest concern is grabbing audio from things and protecting hardware
[04:22:08] <mixfix41> i have things to learn
[04:22:23] <mixfix41> a dac maybe could protect speakers tho
[04:22:28] <theholyduck> wat?
[04:22:30] <mixfix41> if you do audio ripping from vhs
[04:22:31] <mixfix41> yes
[04:22:37] <mixfix41> then you put it on a hardware level
[04:22:42] <mixfix41> where the sound is more safe
[04:22:47] <mixfix41> so you dont blow your speakers
[04:23:02] <mixfix41> not for quality for listening
[04:23:08] <theholyduck> you would only blow your speakers if your volume is set way too high. :P 
[04:23:17] <mixfix41> untrue
[04:23:27] <mixfix41> its vhs some are recorded very unstable audio
[04:23:32] <theholyduck> very true. theres a maximum loudness before the loudness is clipped 
[04:23:37] <mixfix41> they can rip apart your speakers you turn it up but the sound is not loud
[04:23:53] <mixfix41> you dont *hear* it but the speakers are blowing
[04:24:08] <mixfix41> or scrambling is a better word
[04:24:08] <emmeka> my whole adventure into this wasn't to improve audio quality, it was just to make everything work simply in end-to-end digital since I have a KVM switch which can de-embed digital audio... and I find it very interesting that everything sounds *better* this way at relatively low sample rates than it did with a DAC
[04:24:12] <mixfix41> which is permanent damage
[04:24:17] <emmeka> why? because less conversion is better.
[04:24:30] <theholyduck> this sounds like some sort urban legend or a way misunderstood thing :P 
[04:25:35] <theholyduck> if i google vhs audio damage speakers  its all just stories about how a strong magnet can destroy magnetic tape
[04:25:44] <mixfix41> anyway this experience still keeps focus on thee actual speakers. just invest in backups
[04:26:15] <mixfix41> backup peripheral speakers/monitors/whichever its the actual speakers and electricity costs not additional mobo silicon
[04:26:29] <mixfix41> unles you know your components
[04:26:50] <mixfix41> if you are buying general components or not custom mold into your ear its risky that you just dont know the worht
[04:26:54] <mixfix41> worth of those components
[04:27:16] * theholyduck has no idea what you are talking about. 
[04:27:26] <mixfix41> but yeah a dac probs does do something its just so far from your ear your ear components suck while you should save up something better there
[04:27:56] <theholyduck> a dac DOES do something. the point we are making is that we perfected computer DAC design like. 25 years ago
[04:27:58] <theholyduck> or something
[04:28:11] <mixfix41> yeah
[04:28:17] <theholyduck> other than some headphone amplifier circuits on some motherboard soundcards being noisy
[04:28:26] <theholyduck> (and microphone amplifier circuits on motherboards)
[04:28:36] * mixfix41 farts on mootpoot
[04:28:53] <theholyduck> theres nothing really the matter with whatever DAC you have. and you can buy a cheapo usb one to escape it 
[04:30:12] <MootPoot> yeah so 
[04:30:14] <MootPoot> wait
[04:30:16] <MootPoot> brb laundry
[04:30:57] <MootPoot> back
[04:31:10] <emmeka> right, you can buy better headphone amps, but chances are you'd get fairly similar performance from a dedicated USB dac/headphone amp or just running your PC's line out into an amp.
[04:31:11] <MootPoot> emmeka:  you know dedicated DACs use like..usb right
[04:31:16] <emmeka> yes? and.
[04:31:35] <MootPoot> whatever limitation the PC's own audio has is irrelevant
[04:31:47] <emmeka> no, it isn't.

[04:31:59] <emmeka> or well, yes, what your soundcard can do is irrelevant
[04:32:03] <MootPoot> The dac straight up gets handed the audio file
[04:32:26] <emmeka> but your the whole backend audio shit is doing is not irrelevant
[04:32:48] <MootPoot> how so
[04:32:59] <MootPoot> all the PC is doing is reading data and sending it
[04:33:11] <mixfix41> if its a high quality dac is the argument
[04:33:17] <mixfix41> it might im not sure
[04:33:26] <mixfix41> but fuck spending ona professional dac beforehand
[04:33:28] <MootPoot> mixfix41:  go take your IEMs and sit in the corner
[04:33:49] <emmeka> MootPoot like I literally just finished messing with this shit, by default, PulseAudio uses 44.1khz and Pipewire uses 48khz. This can be changed, but if you're not changing it, all your PC is going to send your USB DAC is that level of audio.
[04:33:58] <mixfix41> you are bring a group of rich peevy audiophiles argument in anime mix

[04:35:44] <mixfix41> mootpoot you have to buy a laptop with imbedded processor and proven dac now i think the designers know what they are doing
[04:35:53] <emmeka> I assume this is true on Windows as well in different ways
[04:35:56] <mixfix41> those are fallacies where your ramblings are worse than mine
[04:36:02] <MootPoot> but any desktop OS i've used auto-defaults to the highest output sampling and bitrate
[04:36:48] <MootPoot> and all of this is exlcuding the benefits of having an actual amp

[04:37:23] <emmeka> amp is a separate issue, and you will get much better amps at the same price point by not including a DAC

[04:48:34] <MootPoot> in your view, that was not actually due to the dac
[04:48:37] <emmeka> MootPoot I have a feeling that whatever Windows is doing on the backend with audio, it isn't by default beaming straight 192khz to your DAC. It's probably dealing with all audio as a much lower sampling rate, and then converting it when your DAC asks for that.

[04:54:57] <emmeka> MootPoot I'd say the point here is that your PC's DAC is probably absolutely fine on its own and having a USB one is fairly pointless, and you'd get much better performance by just taking your PC's line out and using a good amp, if you want analog audio. The only exception to this would be for surround sound.

[05:03:13] <MootPoot> define proven
[05:03:30] <MootPoot> its like I've been left hand fapping for 2 days
[05:03:48] <mixfix41> something where it clears the argument. and gets you tinkering while you update system packages to cater to your equipment
[05:03:59] <mixfix41> not arguing about it while both not knowing which packages are making a difference
[05:04:04] <mixfix41> so we are all wrong
[05:04:11] <MootPoot> we never argued about output devices though
[05:04:22] <mixfix41> true
[05:04:27] <MootPoot> I always agreed its worth paying more for good headphones/iems/speakers
[05:04:36] <MootPoot> the dac I was suggesting was AFTER you already have good ones

[05:16:16] <mixfix41> what the devil has the frequency chart proven
[05:16:18] <mixfix41> even
[05:16:27] <MootPoot> plenty of stuff
[05:16:29] <mixfix41> that like some gimmick noobs use to try to get catgirls
[05:16:38] <MootPoot> like how headphones reporduce sound
[05:16:48] <MootPoot> are they "bassy" or "trebly"

[05:17:33] <theholyduck> emmeka:  :P i havent tested my newest mobo. but the one i ran before this had some terrible hum on all the ports. 
[05:17:37] <mixfix41> its not the same electrical frequency its the frequency you get catgirls
[05:17:41] <theholyduck> these days i just use a wireless usb soundcard
[05:17:49] <MootPoot> wireless AND usb?
[05:17:50] <MootPoot> woah
[05:17:53] <MootPoot> usb 5.0
[05:18:05] <theholyduck> :P
[05:18:23] <theholyduck> MootPoot: the 2 things i really like about it is 1) it has working side-tone
[05:18:35] <theholyduck> and 2) it has a zero latency aux in 
[05:18:49] <theholyduck> for plugging other things into that bypasses the slow computer audio 
[05:18:50] <MootPoot> I need a fast way for windows and mac to read/write to each other
[05:18:57] <MootPoot> 's formatted drives
[05:19:05] <MootPoot> there is LAN but its...meh
[05:19:35] <MootPoot> the only solution seems to be cough up 20 bucks for custom stuff from a company called paragon
[05:19:42] <theholyduck> honestly sidetone is such a gamechanger
[05:19:50] <theholyduck> i wish more soundcard had support for it propperly
[05:19:53] <MootPoot> theholyduck:  I've almost successfully created a full remote working setup
[05:19:59] <theholyduck> MootPoot: :P
[05:20:01] <MootPoot> by remote I mean code from campsite
[05:20:06] <MootPoot> or code from ooga-booga land
[05:20:23] <MootPoot> (provided I have phone signal, and enough food )
[05:20:27] <theholyduck> MootPoot:  the ltt crew use some gamestreaming thing for that.

[05:47:39] <mixfix41> the headphone cable is 45 dollars alone thats fucking expensive as shit no i dont recommend buying it but this is actually a good investment rather than hardware that you have to 'figure out' are not worth the cheaper costs

[12:34:00] <isekaijin> Since apparently VTubers are on-topic in this channel, just how harsh is life for independent VTubers?
[12:35:12] <isekaijin> Over the span of two weeks, I ran into a few accounts of VTubers whose videos have between 500 and 1k views. Is it even possible to make a living out of that?
[12:36:31] <beaky> i think they need like hundreds of thousands of subscribers to make a living
[12:37:34] <MootPoot> or 1 nanobot
[12:39:03] <Nanobot> isekaijin: No, you don't make a living on that number of views. You pretty much need hundreds of thousands of subscribers.
[12:39:43] <isekaijin> So, basically, being a VTuber is an expensive hobby for them?
[12:40:59] <Nanobot> Being a VTuber is a hobby that could maybe someday turn into something you can make money on if you manage to grow your channel enough. But it's a very saturated market.
[12:41:16] <Nanobot> Pretty much like any YouTube channel.

[15:41:49] <DunceCotus> ELDERFLOWER?
[15:41:54] <iwasarabbit> schweppes is a company that started out long ago making mineral water
[15:41:57] <lastonestanding> iwasarabbit: Fanta uses this "Colour (Brilliant Blue FCF)" to make it blue
[15:42:40] <DunceCotus> "My first impression was that it smelled like flowers or perfume."
[15:42:41] <Berlin36> anyways, yellow schweppes is impossible to drink for me
[15:42:42] <lastonestanding> Berlin36: the label says "bitter lemon"
[15:42:42] <DunceCotus> ew
[15:42:50] <Berlin36> the blue one is bitter lemon
[15:42:52] <lastonestanding> obviously it's bitter
[15:42:55] <Berlin36> and it tastes exactly like fanta
[15:43:01] <Berlin36> but the yellow one
[15:43:04] <Berlin36> tonic water
[15:43:09] <Berlin36> is very shit
[15:43:20] <DunceCotus> I don't want to drink anything smelling of perfume
[15:43:26] * iwasarabbit likes tonic water
[15:43:31] <Berlin36> oof
[15:43:36] <iwasarabbit> add some gin for more fun
[15:43:38] <lastonestanding> I like volcanic water
[15:43:44] <Berlin36> i tried it about two times
[15:43:52] <Berlin36> couldn't drink it
[15:43:58] <DunceCotus> gin gonna djinn
[15:44:17] <iwasarabbit> it is mostly a drink mixer that you don't drink bare
[15:44:32] <lastonestanding> why are energy drinks so expensive? it's just sugar, caffeine and some water
[15:44:49] <Berlin36> i never drank an energy drink btw
[15:44:54] <Berlin36> oh no
[15:44:57] <Berlin36> i drank blue monster
[15:44:59] <lastonestanding> no red bulls?
[15:45:02] <Berlin36> no
[15:45:14] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: when I was a kid apparently they extracted fluid from the anal glad of civets to make perfume
[15:45:15] <iwasarabbit> they have others, like the slightly pink schweppes russchian
[15:45:32] <Berlin36> how are red bulls?
[15:45:38] <DunceCotus> who or what is civets
[15:45:53] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: it's an animal
[15:45:53] <Berlin36> i mean they are expensive for sure, but what about the 'energy' and the taste
[15:46:10] <DunceCotus> amigojapan first im hearing about it
[15:46:28] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: the same animal they feed coffee to and extract it from their poop
[15:46:33] <Berlin36> ohh
[15:46:38] <iwasarabbit> energy drink taste is all over the place
[15:46:48] <lastonestanding> an energy drink has 300mg of caffeine
[15:46:53] <lastonestanding> that is much
[15:47:10] <Berlin36> yeah
[15:47:12] <lastonestanding> drink one can and you won't be able to sleep
[15:47:18] <Berlin36> whuut
[15:47:19] <DunceCotus> just in case you want heart arrhythmia at 30
[15:48:12] <lastonestanding> the just do sports
[15:48:44] <DunceCotus> that's all humans care about, sports
[15:49:02] <lastonestanding> it's what keeps us going
[15:49:02] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: I must not be human
[15:49:03] <Berlin36> i ride on my longboard sometimes
[15:49:15] <DunceCotus> amigojapan <3
[15:49:22] <iwasarabbit> they most care about watching sports, not doing sports
[15:49:23] <lastonestanding> our body needs activity
[15:49:26] <Berlin36> the speed feels kinda cool on longboard
[15:49:36] <Berlin36> "the speed feels kinda cool"
[15:49:45] <DunceCotus> our body needs sports cause we desire it
[15:50:01] <lastonestanding> we are still animals after all
[15:50:02] <amigojapan> iwasarabbit: doing sports can be fun. But watching it is boring
[15:50:13] <DunceCotus> we are hybrids
[15:50:24] <lastonestanding> not yet
[15:50:39] <lastonestanding> unless you count smartphones as part of our body
[15:50:42] <DunceCotus> its likely animals are hybrids too
[15:50:50] <iwasarabbit> but amigojapan ,the only reason for even having the olympics is that people want to watch it
[15:50:56] <Berlin36> yeah, watching sports is boring
[15:50:57] <Berlin36> but
[15:51:00] <DunceCotus> evolution works different than how Darwinians suggest
[15:51:05] <Berlin36> not longboard downhill
[15:51:06] <amigojapan> iwasarabbit: but not me
[15:51:11] <lastonestanding> does it work like in Pokemon?
[15:51:14] <Berlin36> it is intense
[15:51:24] <DunceCotus> lastonestanding no
[15:51:32] <Berlin36> watch some longboard downhill in youtube
[15:51:32] <amigojapan> iwasarabbit: if it was up to me, there would be no such thing as the Olympics
[15:51:34] <lastonestanding> I never understood why Pokemon Red/Blue was banned in China
[15:51:34] <DunceCotus> but pokemon is correct in that evolution can be quite abrupt
[15:51:50] <DunceCotus> lastonestanding they outlawed fun
[15:51:58] <Berlin36> guys reach 120km/h on a piece of wood with wheels
[15:52:09] <DunceCotus> pokemon is quite individualistic I suppose
[15:52:10] <Berlin36> (longboards)
[15:52:18] <DunceCotus> its about being the single best trainer
[15:52:24] <DunceCotus> fucking over everyone in your path etc
[15:52:41] <iwasarabbit> amigojapan, take control now and stop the olympics, lol
[15:52:53] <DunceCotus> to do that you gotta get good at dog-fighting
[15:53:05] <Berlin36> oh the Olympics started?
[15:53:07] <Berlin36> lmao
[15:53:16] <amigojapan> iwasarabbit: I don't have any official rank to do so
[15:53:40] <Berlin36> i like watching ice skating
[15:53:42] <amigojapan> Berlin36: since Friday jst
[15:53:54] <DunceCotus> amigojapan its alright, the 30 million people in that stadium is social distancing and wearing masks
[15:53:55] <isekaijin> Why are we having an Olympics when the pandemic is not over yet?
[15:54:11] <Berlin36> people want fun
[15:54:25] <DunceCotus> isekaijin they couldn't postpone it further
[15:54:27] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: they said there would be no spectators
[15:54:36] <iwasarabbit> Berlin36, is yuri on the ice this year?
[15:54:36] <DunceCotus> amigojapan they lied xD
[15:54:49] <amigojapan> isekaijin: it's stupid
[15:54:49] <lastonestanding> because the athletes have gotten their vaccine
[15:55:00] <lastonestanding> they are immune!
[15:55:04] <DunceCotus> vaccine doesn't stop transmission
[15:55:11] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: they have people watching?
[15:55:15] <DunceCotus> in fact it may make it worse when transmited
[15:55:29] <DunceCotus> amigojapan I dunno, I thought there were spectators at the opening ceremony
[15:55:32] <DunceCotus> but maybe im wrong
[15:55:37] <isekaijin> amigojapan: Have school classes resumed in Japan?
[15:55:43] <Berlin36> who's yuri
[15:56:03] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: the opening ceremony was kinda dark I could not tell clearly
[15:56:05] <Berlin36> i mean i watched a bit of skating on ice, but i don't know who is who
[15:56:16] <iwasarabbit> Berlin36, I see you have not watched the anime
[15:56:17] <lastonestanding> you don't know yuri gagarin?
[15:56:35] <Berlin36> oh anime, yuri on the ice, i googled it
[15:56:41] <Berlin36> might watch it soon
[15:56:45] <amigojapan> isekaijin: they have been going on for a long time. They only stepped then when the panic started
[15:56:45] <DunceCotus> Anime, on ice
[15:56:48] <Berlin36> lastonestanding, i know him
[15:57:02] <Berlin36> i taught him how to fly 
[15:57:07] <Berlin36> xD
[15:57:33] <lastonestanding> and how to orbit the planet?
[15:57:55] <amigojapan> isekaijin: what have you the idea schools were closed in Japan?
[15:58:13] <amigojapan> Gave
[15:58:32] <Berlin36> and how to explode the planet
[15:59:16] <Berlin36> oh btw, i read an article about the people rating in China
[15:59:21] <Berlin36> is this really true?
[15:59:35] <lastonestanding> "The total number of COVID-19 deaths worldwide has passed four million."
[15:59:59] <amigojapan> Berlin36: you mean social points system?
[16:00:03] <Berlin36> yes
[16:00:25] <isekaijin> amigojapan: No idea... Perhaps the fact it it would be common sense to close schools?
[16:00:25] <amigojapan> Berlin36: I read about it too. No idea how true it is
[16:00:38] <Berlin36> it's frightening
[16:00:55] <amigojapan> isekaijin: well, they did not do it almost at all

[16:01:57] <Berlin36> from 9 to 9 six times a week
[16:02:14] <Berlin36> and being watched the entire time while working
[16:02:16] <iwasarabbit> isekaijin, I heard japan seems to mostly care about people not drinking alcohol after some set time
[16:02:39] <iwasarabbit> that is about as far as the precautions go
[16:02:45] <amigojapan> Berlin36: 12 hours is a short day in Japan
[16:02:57] <lastonestanding> Berlin36: why don't they go outside and do a demonstration?
[16:03:11] <Berlin36> welp, they gonna get extra low points lmao
[16:03:28] <isekaijin> It is not like the state is their employer, right?
[16:03:36] <lastonestanding> but they may be able to change the system
[16:03:38] <Berlin36> i think everybody is just scared, if that is really happening
[16:03:51] <Berlin36> *takes anonymous mask*
[16:03:54] <isekaijin> Protesting in the streets in the face of... private employer abuse?
[16:03:58] <isekaijin> It does not make any sense.
[16:04:43] <isekaijin> In any case, working long hours is par for the course in engineering.
[16:04:53] <isekaijin> It is not ideal, but, well, the world is not ideal.
[16:05:19] <Berlin36> it's just very unpleasant living somewhere where cameras are at every step
[16:05:34] <DunceCotus> isekaijin problem is there's no alternatives, its either work for abusive employers or be destitute

[16:06:54] <Berlin36> here people usually work 8 hours, 5 days a wekk
[16:07:02] <amigojapan> beaky: it depends on how crazy hours they work during the 4 days
[16:07:06] <DunceCotus> 8 hours is already far too long

[16:08:01] <DunceCotus> isekaijin then let us be entitled

[16:08:47] <DunceCotus> its slavery sold to us as freedom

[16:24:04] <Berlin36> cool
[16:24:09] <Berlin36> what tablet do you have?
[16:24:11] <KatrinValerie> Yes graphic tablets are supposed to work out of the box
[16:24:17] <KatrinValerie> unless you run something like arch
[16:24:23] <isekaijin> Kamvas 13
[16:24:23] <Berlin36> yeah, arch
[16:24:26] <KatrinValerie> then you need to add udev configuration
[16:24:37] <Berlin36> i have huion 1060 plus
[16:24:39] <isekaijin> KatrinValerie: I use Arch Linux and my tablet works out of the box.
[16:24:45] <KatrinValerie> And install the kernel module I think
[16:24:52] <Berlin36> my stylus may be broken a bjt
[16:24:57] <Berlin36> it works only if wired
[16:24:58] <KatrinValerie> isekaijin: it's been a while since I used arch
[16:25:10] <KatrinValerie> Back then you had to configure pretty much everything on your own
[16:25:15] <Berlin36> it has a battery but it now works only when wired
[16:25:15] <isekaijin> Yeah.
[16:25:22] <isekaijin> KatrinValerie: Nowadays it is not so much like that anymore.
[16:25:42] <Berlin36> yeah, idk, but arch it's pretty cool
[16:26:14] <isekaijin> There is even a guided installer. You still have more control if you manually perform the commands in the Installation guide, though.
[16:26:29] <Berlin36> i tried it... archfi is better
[16:27:22] <Berlin36> i also tried to install on myself... but it just didn't work :D

[16:29:05] <KatrinValerie> Krita is pretty versatile yes
[16:29:31] <isekaijin> I am not an artist. I use my tablet to write formulas and draw diagrams. So most of the time I just use Xournal++.

[16:33:12] <Omega037> he cant even talk much at this point
[16:33:16] <KatrinValerie> oh
[16:33:19] <Berlin36> i always thought everyone could read when i was at kindergarden
[16:33:26] <KatrinValerie> I started to learn reading at 3
[16:33:30] <Omega037> well, my youngest is also autistic
[16:33:44] <Omega037> so language is a difficulty
[16:33:47] <KatrinValerie> What a coincidence, I am autistic
[16:33:52] <KatrinValerie> but without much language limitations
[16:33:57] <amigojapan> Bco1981: spoonm , you guys here? It will soon be recording time
[16:34:11] *** Joins: arakimo (~arakimo@user/arakimo)
[16:34:15] <KatrinValerie> Omega037: Try to offer non-verbal ways of communication
[16:34:30] <Omega037> he will eventually get verbal, we are hoping
[16:34:39] <KatrinValerie> Omega037: teaching letters and reading will be challenging if he remains non verbal, but it is possible and vital
[16:34:57] *** Joins: Sxem (~sxemskymo@pool-108-31-231-10.washdc.fios.verizon.net)
[16:34:58] * ImoutoBot welcomes S​xem (8 / 89): <S​xem> i think i fart around 20 times per day. 14 is the average.
[16:35:00] <Omega037> yeah, we got him diagnosed early so he has been getting a lot of help
[16:35:02] <KatrinValerie> Omega037: Don't worry too much about that, there are tools that can be used for communication these days
[16:35:09] <Omega037> he has come a long way in fact
[16:35:19] <KatrinValerie> Text to speech programs can help
[16:35:41] <KatrinValerie> Cartoons are also a good way to build an understanding of social interaction
[16:35:46] <Omega037> based on his progress so far, he will be at least partially verbal
[16:35:53] <KatrinValerie> Cartoon characters have less complex expressions
[16:35:59] <Berlin36> i don't even remember how i learned to read
[16:36:00] <KatrinValerie> And much more pronounced
[16:36:04] <Omega037> he wasnt saying any words at all around 20 months
[16:36:18] <KatrinValerie> Cartoons tought me the basics of human interaction and I would spend hours watching them
[16:36:19] <Omega037> now he can say a bunch and even 2-word combos
[16:36:31] <Omega037> I think the issue is more that he will just shut down sometimes
[16:36:32] <Berlin36> guess i just was asking my mom "what does that letter mean"
[16:36:36] <KatrinValerie> I would rewatch them on reruns and eventually remember all the episodes
[16:36:37] <Omega037> but it is hard to say at this age
[16:36:52] <Omega037> he watches mostly what his older siblings want to watch
[16:37:23] <KatrinValerie> Definitely use his interests to build a relationship, that is the best way to communicate with autistic children
[16:37:35] <amigojapan> Berlin36: much of elementry school is spent leading Kanji in Japan
[16:38:07] <Berlin36> ooof kanji, i look at them and i just can't understand how people learn them
[16:38:13] <KatrinValerie> Omega037: a good relationship to older siblings can help a lot

[16:38:50] <Berlin36> oh i see

[16:39:41] <KatrinValerie> Omega037: these things sound really good, don't let anyone tell you that he's disabled, autistic people just see the world differently and experience things different.
[16:39:42] <Berlin36> omg
[16:39:50] <Berlin36> flower, yes
[16:39:55] <Berlin36> but holy fucc
[16:39:55] * iwasarabbit turns into a flower

[16:40:52] <Berlin36> (from google translate)
[16:40:53] <Omega037> like I get the point being made
[16:41:01] <amigojapan> isekaijin: drawing pretty characters is not usually a requirement to live in Japan
[16:41:02] <KatrinValerie> Omega037: well, they might need assistence in the future, but autistic people have a lot of potential in the modern world, when given the right environment.
[16:41:15] <Omega037> but ultimately it is important to be realistic in how well a person can function in normal society

[16:41:31] <lastonestanding> what is the Arial of chinese letters?
[16:41:37] <lastonestanding> the default font
[16:41:38] <Omega037> my son will hopefully be high functioning, but likely will need support his whole life
[16:41:51] <KatrinValerie> Wish I had support
[16:42:04] <Omega037> but spending a lot of time with other autism dads, it gets pretty rough
[16:42:26] <KatrinValerie> I actually need a clean and ordered environment to not be constantly stressed, but I am horrible at tidying up x.x
[16:42:33] <isekaijin> Omega037: Hopefully he will be as independent as possible. :-)
[16:42:36] <Omega037> so saying they are just "different" when they attack people and eat their own poop and cant talk
[16:42:43] <KatrinValerie> try your best to teach him basic life skills
[16:42:49] <KatrinValerie> those are the most important I think
[16:43:14] <Omega037> he fortunately has no physical issues and his intelligence was actually ahead for his age
[16:43:22] <KatrinValerie> Omega037: are these kids receiving some kind of therapy? and if what is it called?
[16:43:23] <Omega037> he is also not sensory avoidant, which is nice
[16:43:41] <Omega037> he has been getting Speech therapy since 18 months
[16:43:51] <Omega037> ABA since 24 months
[16:43:56] <saganman> Alright amigojapan, I'm making one coffee
[16:44:03] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: did you install mumble?

[16:44:35] <Omega037> he doesn't much yet because he doesn't really have a lot of negative behaviors
[16:44:46] <Omega037> ABA is also a godsend to many
[16:44:54] <KatrinValerie> This is an opinion of an autistic person on ABA
[16:45:18] <KatrinValerie> Omega037: Many autistic kids develop PTSD from ABA :/
[16:45:18] <Omega037> yeah, I've talked to many and hung out in their subreddit
[16:45:23] <Omega037> eh
[16:45:28] <Omega037> my read is a bit different
[16:45:42] <Berlin36> what is aba?
[16:45:44] <Omega037> ABA is effectively not that disimilar to parenting in general
[16:46:00] <KatrinValerie> Berlin36: It's operand conditioning to reduce autistic behaviours
[16:46:08] <Berlin36> oh
[16:46:23] <KatrinValerie> Skinner Box style
[16:46:32] <KatrinValerie> When you break it down to the very basics
[16:46:38] <Omega037> the complaints read very much like kids who feel "mistreated" because their parents wanted them to be good adults and not be their best friend
[16:46:40] <KatrinValerie> Some only use positive reinforcement
[16:46:58] <KatrinValerie> but it can still be harmful
[16:47:03] <Berlin36> i don't know much about autism, i read a bit about it, but it seems there are very different behaviours
[16:47:17] <Omega037> KatrinValerie, as a parent you have to weigh that harm against the good
[16:47:22] <KatrinValerie> when behaviours that we use to regulate ourselves are supressed we get meltdowns more easily
[16:47:35] <isekaijin> Childhood is long enough to learn what behaviors are acceptable in some way or another.
[16:47:42] <KatrinValerie> Omega037: Being prohibited from stimming in school made me have break downs were I would hide under the table :/
[16:47:42] <isekaijin> There is no need for particularly cruel methods.
[16:47:59] <KatrinValerie> Prohibiting autistic behaviours in general is bad.
[16:48:01] <Omega037> there is no, but ABA is not inherently cruel
[16:48:03] <Omega037> it can be
[16:48:11] <KatrinValerie> A kid should learn positive coping skills instead
[16:48:15] <Omega037> so it really depends on the therapist and the behaviors being modified
[16:48:21] <KatrinValerie> If they have harmful stims they can be replaced with healthy coping tools

[17:36:09] <amigojapan> Yeah nicotiana it is

[19:15:43] <nicotiana> it's good to hear that saganman
[19:15:48] <shirafuno> doing much better. I think my covid infection is almost gone. My temperature has been down today without the use of paracetamol
[19:16:08] <shirafuno> still got 3 days left of my Legally obligated self isolation
[19:16:27] <saganman> that's good shirafuno, I didn't know you got covid

[19:17:06] <shirafuno> thats the 4 hours. 
[19:17:09] <shirafuno> haha
[19:17:21] <saganman> oh lol
[19:17:27] <shirafuno> But yeah, started showing symptoms on the 17th. 
[19:18:26] <saganman> the first few days were hard for me, mostly flu like symptoms but knowing it is a viral fever that could go either way was scary
[19:18:30] <saganman> shirafuno: ^^
[19:18:49] <shirafuno> Yeahh, i have health anxiety and it's not helping my recovery.

[19:31:27] <amigojapan> KatrinValerie: it's harder then I imagined
[19:31:57] <KatrinValerie> amigojapan: It's a matter of how well adjusted you are to reading a script or freespeech formats

[19:34:36] <KatrinValerie> I am not on my own
[19:34:53] <amigojapan> KatrinValerie: good luck
[19:35:06] <KatrinValerie> Me and the girlfriends want to try to create a retro RPG/Platformer crossover
[19:35:19] <KatrinValerie> Oh no I spilled our genius idea
[19:35:40] <KatrinValerie> but really, it all boils down to how well we set up the story and how good the artwork works for story telling
[19:35:56] <KatrinValerie> but I am confident about that part, more concerned with what engine to pick and how to actually plan development
[19:36:11] <KatrinValerie> amigojapan: You are of the just start implementing it type aren't you?
[19:36:34] <amigojapan> Right KatrinValerie

[19:44:41] <KatrinValerie> So our graphic designer can also do UX
[19:44:49] <KatrinValerie> She's more of an artist really
[19:44:59] <amigojapan> I see

[20:23:20] <saganman> I was joking KatrinValerie but yeah people have always been like this apparently. I have seen this news article in Twitter from 1989 where they had same kind of misinformation.
[20:25:06] <KatrinValerie> saganman: Yeah, the red socks campaigns are as old as democracy
[20:25:27] <shirafuno> saganman, So started off as sore throat with light cough. Then That lessened and I had a high fever and loss of smell/taste. Now the fever looks to be clearing up I still have the loss of smell & taste and I can't breathe in deeply without needing to cough
[20:25:28] <KatrinValerie> Like even when there was zero indication of socialist revolution

[20:29:40] <saganman> KatrinValerie: I think if people had proper education, this wouldn’t have blown up so much.
[20:29:56] <KatrinValerie> saganman: I agree
[20:30:07] <KatrinValerie> Especially information on how to navigate modern media
[20:30:26] <KatrinValerie> Too many people take what they read on social media at faces value
[20:30:31] <isekaijin> saganman: Rather than “proper education”, it is more like “understanding that we are in this together”.

[22:07:58] <shirafuno> i gotta call my pharmacy tomorrow morning first thing. they're delivering my regular medication and I gotta ask them to throw in some LFT too
[22:08:11] <Aurora_v_kosmose> lft?

[22:14:08] <Aurora_v_kosmose> For some reason I think "Liver Function Test" is more likely than crypto 
[22:16:14] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Apparently there's multiple cryptos using LFT as an accronym.

[22:17:15] <nicotiana> Liver Function Test is done by a lab on a blood sample. it's not medication.

[22:19:23] <nicotiana> not like that, no
[22:20:21] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Didn't they have some pretty serious inaccuracy problems for covid testing or was that just initial batch issues?
[22:21:11] <Aurora_v_kosmose> False-negatives, that is.

[23:00:17] <Aurora_v_kosmose> It's not a particularly useful option unless you're hosting servers on the machine with some UPS sending a trigger to poweroff then cutting power until mains power comes back online.
[23:01:03] <Bco1981> i don't think the bios has that feature
[23:01:06] <Aurora_v_kosmose> If that sounds like a small-business kind of use-case, hat's because it is.
[23:01:21] <Bco1981> i enable that on my pc's in my basement
[23:01:33] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Bco1981: It might not expose the menu, in which case I recommend angry ranting at the BIOS/motherboard provider

[23:07:21] <ButterNoodle> Bco1981: there is also an auto power on at X time in the bios

[23:07:44] <ButterNoodle> check ur acpi stuff - wake up on features
[23:08:00] <Bco1981> but the bios version was 404, and there is a 410 available
[23:08:09] <Bco1981> ButterNoodle: there is non.

[23:08:33] <Aurora_v_kosmose> If Bco1981 has a consumergrade laptop, their BIOS probably has little no to options besides setting time and disable TPM/Secure Boot.
[23:08:36] <Bco1981> it's not just limited, it's extremly limited

[23:09:40] <Aurora_v_kosmose> I honestly think that should be industry standardized to either provide all options the system implements or use expose a functional coreboot for it.
[23:10:55] * Bco1981 makes mental note, next time look through the usermanual to see bios options BEFORE buying.
[23:11:38] <Aurora_v_kosmose> For laptops I generally recommend buying refurbished prosumer/business if you can't afford them to buy them new outright.

[23:12:05] <Jigsy> Okay, I've come to the conclusion that this is a new censorship technique by Google.
[23:12:15] <Jigsy> First they started censoring all my comments.
[23:12:23] <Jigsy> Now everything above 144p is impossible to watch.
[23:12:26] <ButterNoodle> and prosumer with a good gpu is $$$
[23:12:42] <Bco1981> yeah, i could afford it. but still took a loan... it was a bit much to spend some $2400 after just upgrading my main pc that also ended up over $3000.
[23:12:45] <Aurora_v_kosmose> ButterNoodle: Getting one with TB3 allows you to use an external GPU dock with acceptable performance.
[23:13:00] <Aurora_v_kosmose> You can then simply use a desktop GPU with your system.
[23:13:02] <ButterNoodle> Jigsy: use ur smurf account NotJigsy
[23:13:19] <ButterNoodle> Aurora_v_kosmose: tru.. I have thought about that also
[23:13:36] <ButterNoodle> kinda kills the portability tho
[23:13:42] <Bco1981> ^
[23:13:49] <Aurora_v_kosmose> ButterNoodle: Meh, backpacks are great and convenient.
[23:14:02] <ButterNoodle> dell makes a few shitty laptops w gpu's
[23:14:03] <Bco1981> and i don't think the Oculus Rift will run on it.
[23:14:05] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Carry a basic firstaid and clothing-mending kit with yourself.
[23:14:20] <ButterNoodle> Aurora_v_kosmose: still carrying around a laptop, gpu box, and a suitable monitor...
[23:14:31] <ButterNoodle> I could toss my node202 in the bag instead
[23:14:32] <Aurora_v_kosmose> ButterNoodle: Well, the laptop should have a semi-decent monitor.
[23:14:44] <Aurora_v_kosmose> ButterNoodle: Ah. I see. Hm.
[23:15:01] <ButterNoodle> does it work like that? I think u still need a monitor connected to the external gpu
[23:15:04] <Aurora_v_kosmose> You might have to use some sort of dummy render on the GPU and then DMA-copy it to framebuffer on the laptop.
[23:15:16] <ButterNoodle> lol linux games tho
[23:19:58] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Hm, yeah, issue is a lot more awkward when you intend on gaming on the go. Though the notion tickles my funny bone.
