[10:23:12] <Ungwelian> People communicate for a lot of reasons.
[10:24:41] <Ungwelian> For example, some people talk to others because they feel bad.
[10:25:04] <Ungwelian> Or the opposite - they feel good.

[10:43:02] <amigojapan> Don't have some secret*
[10:44:07] <causative> your intention is for the person who you asked the question of to tell you what time it is
[10:44:49] <causative> you hope by your question to adjust their mental state to result in that action
[10:45:13] <causative> to put them in a question-answering mental state
[10:46:36] <Ungwelian> That's a very convoluted way to think of a simple thing.
[10:46:58] <Ungwelian> The primacy is not with "changing the other person's mental state", but to know time.
[10:47:13] <causative> via the intermediary of changing the other person's mental state
[10:47:19] <causative> that's what distinguishes communication from other types of actions
[10:47:59] <causative> if you just looked at a clock, it would serve the same purpose of knowing the time, but in a different, non-communicative way
[10:48:21] <causative> (at least, not person-to-person communication; you may say that there is communication from the clock to you, but this is of a different sort)
[10:49:05] <Ungwelian> You're insisting in the primery importance of things which are not primary at all.
[10:49:32] <causative> all intentional action you take, is in service to some objective - some change you wish to effect in the world.  Communication is an intentional action, and it is limited in its effects to the minds of other people, by which all its other effects may come
[10:49:42] <Ungwelian> This is like saying that shopping for groceries is an attempt to wear shoes.
[10:50:00] <causative> it is not like that
[10:51:11] <causative> if we were to put shopping in a similar framework, we would say that the meaning of a shopping trip is the change you wish to effect in your inventory
[10:51:48] <causative> e.g. if you go out to buy shoes, then you wish to effect a change in your inventory by which you add shoes to it and deduct a certain quantity of money from it
[10:51:52] <Ungwelian> And for that inventory change, you need shoes.
[10:52:08] <Ungwelian> Same thing with going to work. You need shoes.
[10:52:14] <Ungwelian> Working is an attempt to wear shoes.
[10:53:01] <causative> by the time you've gone to work you must have previously succeeded in the attempt to wear shoes
[10:53:07] <causative> so work could not be that attempt
[10:53:17] <Ungwelian> Sometimes communication is just one-sided.

[11:22:49] <causative> well, does every computer program halt or not halt?
[11:23:02] <causative> provability can be expressed as whether a certain program halts on a certain input
[11:23:42] <causative> I don't see how you get anything other than "it halts after X steps" or "it doesn't"
[11:23:59] <amigojapan> causative: but even if that is true, there is nothing wrong with that
[11:24:34] <causative> are you talking about seeking sympathy when sad, amigojapan ?
[11:24:47] <brownorange> when speaking of itself let's say a program is asserting a property , one of provability. not a propositional statement about a property, that comes after
[11:24:53] <amigojapan> causative: no, asking the time
[11:25:03] <causative> well, there's nothing wrong with it
[11:25:07] <causative> I didn't say there was
[11:25:15] <amigojapan> Ah ok causative
[11:26:01] <brownorange> provability can be rooted in many things than a particular question
[11:26:05] <causative> brownorange, the program I am speaking of is one that takes as input a proposition, and enumerates all possible proofs of all propositions, and halts and says "yes" if it ever manages to prove the proposition you gave it
[11:26:31] <causative> if this program halts on an input formula, then the formula is provable
[11:26:36] <causative> if it doesn't halt, the formula is not provable
[11:26:45] <causative> and it must either halt or not, do you agree?
[11:27:33] <brownorange> I think I have to reject halt or not halt, as a proposition
[11:27:48] <causative> what's the third option?
[11:28:17] <brownorange> to elaborate as the proposition related to haltability specifically
[11:29:17] <causative> ??
[11:29:26] <brownorange> forall x, x or not x.
[11:29:40] <brownorange> that statement is a proposition, but what it speaks of is not a proposition
[11:30:26] <brownorange> x could be any object
[11:33:46] <brownorange> i guess i would view your program's task as not propositional l.e.m
[11:35:18] <brownorange> does that make sense ?
[11:37:43] <brownorange> the provability task of your described program is not itself obeying propsitional l.e.m but the more traditional generic l.e.m.

[11:53:07] <ro-bot-o> [url] The slave | vlepy.github.io
[11:55:43] <brownorange> i would regard provable as a property, not provable isn't a separate property.
[11:56:20] <mannequin> go to a shopping mall a try destroying a mannequin, see what happens
[11:56:34] <brownorange> in this  context provable or not provable is speaking about provability the property or things that having nothing to do with provability.
[11:57:10] <brownorange> you are either talking about provability or not
[11:58:07] <brownorange> thus I'm asserting provability as a truth predicate doesn't make sense.
[11:59:22] <brownorange> Prov(x) is not equal to propositional truth.
[12:03:24] <brownorange> I'm not a mathematician but i'm pretty sure the way it goes is pure logic statements get apriori status in how you evaluate them. where as math statements are aposteriori.  this is because basic logic has a decision procedure
[12:04:48] <brownorange> the logical paradox incompleteness relies on appears to still rely on an aposteriori underpinning. it istherefore the mathematician's fault for constructing an invalid wff in such cases
[12:06:37] <brownorange> applying propositional l.e.m to a bad construction of Prov(a), is not as interesting as people make it out to be. i'll rest my case there until someone disagrees
[12:09:29] <mannequin> then rest your case, hard to get what you're going about
[12:10:37] <rubiksdream> brownorange this would probably go over better in ##math-offtopic?
[12:11:00] <rubiksdream> in any case im curious what you're trying to say, are you taking issue with godels incompleteness theorems?
[12:11:48] *** Joins: Keter (~Keter@user/keter)
[12:11:50] <brownorange> well the idea of the incompleteness theorem is if math can talk about itself, then you can show statements that deny their own provability resulting in undecidability, thus not all wffs obey the propositional l.e.m. and a or not a is important to what completeness of a formal system is
[12:12:28] <brownorange> the whole point of completeness is to show a or not a forall a.
[12:12:49] <brownorange> a counter example to math being complete shouldn't be based on a incorrect treatment of provability
[12:14:20] <brownorange> my pedantic argument is based on provability not being a truth predicate, and as such is not to do with propositional l.e.m but the more standard l.e.m.
[12:14:57] <brownorange> that's it.
[12:15:24] <mannequin> maybe try simplier form of english
[12:15:37] <mannequin> it looks like you go to a library 3 times a day
[12:15:50] <brownorange> ok. how about just provable and not provable?
[12:16:20] <mannequin> i used to believe that everything is a matter of belief
[12:16:41] <rubiksdream> im not an expert on this topic, but I am a graduate student working in mathematics (not logic of course), im not sure what you mean by 'mathematics talking about itself' here, im familiar with the usual statement of godels first incompleteness theorem though..
[12:16:48] <mannequin> but people proven me wrong
[12:17:46] <brownorange> rubiksdream problem is that statement is quite complicated to setup.
[12:17:57] <rubiksdream> fair enough :/
[12:18:23] <rubiksdream> i think i remember you from ##math, you've been on there before haven't you?
[12:18:41] <brownorange> yes. i usually am talking about completeness or consistency
[12:18:49] <rubiksdream> do you work in formal logic?
[12:18:52] <brownorange> nope.
[12:19:02] <mannequin> now what if your eyes lie
[12:19:45] <brownorange> i go from a mixture of source while deriving my own conclusions, then come onto irc to ask questions
[12:19:59] <rubiksdream> i agree with what I think you are saying about 'math statements' being interpreted post-hoc, whereas statements in formal logic come with a rule that tells you precisely how they should be interpreted..
[12:20:09] <rubiksdream> but after that I can't parse what you wrote
[12:21:10] <brownorange> l.e.m is law of excluded middle.  you have propositional l.e.m which is asserting something about a specific object known as a proposition. it is (a or not a)
[12:21:31] <brownorange> the generic l.e.m is related to the three laws of thought (i think)
[12:22:28] <rubiksdream> anyway, maybe I can be of help to onlookers who are getting lost in the word salad, in very simple terms, a 'formal system' is basically a programming language. There are symbols, and there are rules that tell you how you can string together the symbols to make 'words' (formulas), then sentences are basically logical statements that talk about mathematical objects (lets just say numbers)
[12:23:14] <rubiksdream> after you write a sentence in the language of a 'formal system' you want it to have some meaning, so to every sentence you can assign a truth value, the sentence is either true or false
[12:23:30] <rubiksdream> and this is also done via some rules, that we make up
[12:26:36] <brownorange> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_thought  appear to be expressed in terms of being (existence?). so I regard them as more generic than a proposition being true or not
[12:26:36] <rubiksdream> now godels first incompleteness theorem says, if you have a formal system taking symbols from some list, e.g. {x_1,x_2,....}, and with this formal system you can write down every statement that is true about whole numbers (1,2,3,..) and how they interact with each other in terms of the basic operations you can do with them (+,*,-,/), then assuming your system is consistent, i.e. the only sentences you can form in this system are 'true'
[12:26:36] <rubiksdream> (demonstrably, i.e. 1+1 = 2), then there will always be some statement, about whole numbers and how they interact, which is 'true', but does not have a proof using the rules of your formal system (oh yeah, the formal system should come with rules you can use to 'prove' its statements)
[12:26:36] <ro-bot-o> [url] Law of thought - Wikipedia | en.wikipedia.org
[12:28:25] <rubiksdream> so to me what this is saying is, if you confine yourself to some finite set of rules you can use to prove whether a statement is true/false, and these rules aren't garbage, i.e. they dont allow you to prove things that are false, like 1 = 0, then within this system there will be statements, which could be anything, like 'there exist infinitely many pairs of primes (p_1,p_2) that are distance 2 apart |p_2 - p_1| = 2' which you cannot prove

[12:29:01] <rubiksdream> so there is a 'gap' between 'truth' and 'provability'
[12:29:25] <rubiksdream> just thought i'd try to describe what brownorange is disputing
[12:29:54] <rubiksdream> he is trying to say there should be no gap between 'truth' and 'provability', and the reason there is a gap is because one of these notions is not defined as precisely as the other
[12:30:17] <brownorange> yep basically.
[12:30:29] <rubiksdream> awesome, so I think were on the same page
[12:31:01] <rubiksdream> (and obviously, the notion that is defined less precisely, is 'truth')
[12:31:08] <rubiksdream> provability is very easy to define extremely precisely
[12:31:35] <brownorange> as a truth predicate it doesn't make sense
[12:32:21] <brownorange> Prov(x) shouldn't be taking seriously in a wff
[12:32:38] <rubiksdream> brownorange i would assume you agree that at least if we restrict our focus to propositional logic, truth is a well defined thing
[12:33:09] <rubiksdream> its only when you open the door to first order logic, does truth become a much murkier notion
[12:33:13] *** Joins: wonko (~wjc@62.115.229.50)
[12:33:18] <rubiksdream> basically because of quantifiers
[12:33:44] <brownorange> yes. but since both have completeness theorems, it's when we venture into math it all falls apart
[12:34:21] <brownorange> math is where you do not have a convenient procedure to apriori know what will be true unless it is a pure logic formula
[12:35:29] <brownorange> in math you cross your fingers and hope you can prove random wffs you pursue
[12:35:33] <rubiksdream> hmm, thats true
[12:35:39] <rubiksdream> its also what makes math interesting
[12:35:45] <rubiksdream> its a double edged sword
[12:36:18] <rubiksdream> by the way though, there is no convenient procedure to prove a valid wff in first order logic
[12:37:13] <rubiksdream> there is no algorithm that can decide whether any wff is valid , when the wff is a first order logic sentence
[12:37:14] <brownorange> also I think math is a sport where we should battle dragons and not celebrate the existence of potholes.  incompleteness has to be earned not assumed for fun.
[12:37:32] <rubiksdream> because the existence of such an algorithm would allow you to solve the halting problem
[12:37:58] <brownorange> by valid do you speak of truth or grammar?
[12:39:06] <rubiksdream> well, in some sense I speak of grammar
[12:39:52] <rubiksdream> that is to say, if you start with the empty theory {}, then all consequents of the empty theory are those sentences that are true in all models of your first order logic
[12:39:59] <rubiksdream> *models of your first order language
[12:40:34] <rubiksdream> and the completeness theorem says that there is literally a proof tree for every such valid sentence
[12:41:15] <rubiksdream> meaning you can start with the sentences which are universally true, e.g. forallx. (x=x) etc. and use all of the natural deduction rules to arrive at some also universally true sentence
[12:41:47] <brownorange> or false on, but yes I think
[12:41:51] <rubiksdream> things like forallx. forally. ( (x=y) -> (y=x) )
[12:42:00] <rubiksdream> this has a proof
[12:42:20] <rubiksdream> but there is no algorithm , that can take any first order logic sentence, and tell you whether it has a proof or not
[12:42:25] <rubiksdream> (or is true or not)
[12:42:44] <rubiksdream> so first order logic is also troublesome in this sense
[12:43:03] <rubiksdream> there *is* an algorithm that does the analogous thing, for propositional logic formulas
[12:43:54] <rubiksdream> so you may also have to take issue with our current definition of algorithm :)
[12:44:17] <rubiksdream> and that is pretty hard to take issue with (there does not seem to be an obvious alternative notion)
