[13:28:45] <dayday> Scandinavian York (referred to at the time as Jórvík) or Danish York is a term used by historians for the south of Northumbria (modern-day Yorkshire) during the period of the late 9th century and first half of the 10th century, when it was dominated by Norse warrior-kings; in particular, it is used to refer to York, the city controlled by these kings.

[20:40:56] <morlog> lets just say that the people that are involved with the newspaper dont think quite the same as normal everyday people
[20:41:12] <nativetexan> tru dat
[20:41:17] <murthy> I bought a cheap mechanical keyboard and I hate all the mechanical keyboards
[20:41:23] <morlog> so things like flattr are a bit beyond their understanding
[20:41:41] <murthy> morlog: oh ok
[20:41:44] <morlog> ive been loving my keychron k6
[20:41:55] <morlog> 65% mechanical
[20:42:07] <murthy> It's like one step away from typewriters
[20:42:08] <morlog> hot swap, rgb led's
[20:42:20] <murthy> You people are mad to use such keyboards
[20:42:40] <murthy> I like low profiles a lot
[20:42:46] <murthy> They are very ergonomic
[20:42:50] <morlog> i type a lot better on it than i do membrane keyboards
[20:43:04] <morlog> they have low profile mechanical keyboards
[20:43:10] <murthy> idk
[20:43:18] <morlog> every macbook has one
[20:43:26] <murthy> RGB may be nice
[20:43:40] <morlog> it is, helps me see the keyboard in low light
[20:43:48] <murthy> Yes
[20:43:49] <morlog> the letters light up
[20:43:57] <nativetexan> like when you game
[20:44:17] <murthy> Also the sound
[20:44:22] <morlog> or when you need that one special character
[20:44:23] <nativetexan> this keyboard can reflect the backgropund colors when you game
[20:44:24] <murthy> I like it being quite
[20:45:00] <murthy> nativetexan: oh yes and also highlight the keys of the game
[20:45:11] <nativetexan> yeah that too
[20:45:11] <morlog> i like that if one key goes out that i dont have to go out and buy a new keyboard
[20:45:18] <morlog> just replace that switch
[20:45:35] <murthy> morlog: ya
[20:46:13] <murthy> Membranes are not for gaming
[20:46:32] <murthy> One of a key is sluggish on my membranes
[20:46:44] <morlog> i want to make a custom one but with what i want it would end up costing me around $1000US
[20:46:45] <murthy> Also they are too slow for gaming
[20:46:55] <morlog> no they arent
[20:47:04] <nativetexan> back 4 blood released this past tuesday
[20:47:04] <morlog> they are way faster than a membrane

[20:47:35] <morlog> cool
[20:47:41] <murthy> nativetexan: the scanning freq
[20:47:51] <morlog> frames per second
[20:48:01] <murthy> nativetexan: the Logitech ones scan a wooping 4000 times
[20:48:01] <morlog> scanning rate would be htz
[20:48:30] <nativetexan> refresh rate, my monitor is 75hz so i set the frame rate to 75hz in the settings and it just worked, just like you it should
