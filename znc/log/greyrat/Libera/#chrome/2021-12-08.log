[06:42:53] <Urk> Something is wrong with Chrome, and it won't display.  Any ideas?  I am running Debian stable Linux 10 aka version 4.19_18
[06:43:37] <Urk> Any idea how to fix this problem?
[06:45:39] <Urk> Incidentally Chromium opens up fine.  Problem is just with Chrome.
[06:53:50] <Urk> Never mind.  It ended up being the infamous Chrome lock, but this time it was hiding its presence.
