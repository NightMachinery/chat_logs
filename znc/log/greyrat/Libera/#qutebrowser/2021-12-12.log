[01:34:12] <elshize> hey, I've been having some rendering issues for the past few days, I see glitches and sometimes my whole browser window goes blank for a second; I thought it might be wayland related but also happens on X. tried from fedora package (2.4.0) and earlier version from github (2.3.1), same thing. could it be due to some dependency update? version info: https://0x0.st/-F9j.version

[05:00:01] <Itaru> Hey, has anyone else had an issue with trying to set qutebrowsers useragent?
[05:01:07] <Itaru> I set 'c.content.headers.custom = {'accept': 'text/html, */*; q=0.01 gzip, deflate'}' in my config.py file
[05:01:31] <Itaru> but when I check my headers with coveryourtracks, it says that they're 'text/html, */*; q=0.01 gzip, deflate gzip, deflate, br en-US,en;q=0.5'
[05:02:03] <Itaru> (the 'deflate gzip' is the part that shouldn't be there)
[05:04:29] <Itaru> How can I remove that 'deflate gzip'? It being there changes my fingerprint from about 1 in 4, to about 1 in 116917, making my browser uniquely identifiable

[08:43:54] <famubu> When searching with google (with javascript off), it shows something that it calls 'featured snippets' as the first results. But hints doesn't come up for following that link. Instead hint for a link to help page about 'featured snippets' alone pops up. Manually clicking the link with mouse works though. Is there a way for getting hints for those links as well?
