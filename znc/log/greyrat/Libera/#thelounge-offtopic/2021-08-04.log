[12:52:36] <bacon> hi there, i am bacon!
[12:53:08] <bookworm> not that it makes any more sense here...
[12:55:21] <bacon> I just want to say hello when I enter a new channel, not malicious
[12:55:26] <bacon> +bookworm
[12:56:02] <bookworm> I see
[12:56:28] <bookworm> you don't need to add + or @ or somesuch prior to a nick, they are just a status symbol (aka hat) and not part of the nick
[12:56:55] <bacon> Got it.
[12:57:05] <bookworm> trying out IRC then?
[12:57:30] <bacon> Then let's talkï¼Ÿ
[12:57:50] <bookworm> sure, why not? It's an off topic channel so that's what it's for ;)
[12:58:11] <bookworm> although I don't have much time I'm afraid, others might chip in or you need to look for some topic channel with more people
[12:58:12] <bacon> Speaking of sports, I have a very troublesome problem recently.
[12:58:46] <bookworm> my problem with sports is that I'm not doing it due to the effing virus...
[12:59:07] <bacon> Speaking of sports,my wife asks me to go to the gym every day, but I don't want to exercise at all, and my hand hurts just after the vaccine!
[12:59:22] <bacon> I don't think i need exercise
[12:59:50] <bookworm> well, biology disagrees
[13:00:34] <bacon> Then, do you think the water tastes good? 
[13:01:15] <bookworm> you aren't making much sense
[13:01:25] <bacon> My doctor told me not to drink too much water. Although my friends and colleagues drink 2000ml of water every day, he said that coffee is better for the body.
[13:01:54] <bacon> For example, coffee makes me feel better and less tired. I drink at least six cups a day!
[13:02:14] <bacon> No wonder my doctor told me not to drink unflavored plain water.
[13:02:27] <bacon> What do you think?
[13:02:55] <bookworm> that I should stop responding to a nick that barely passes the touring test :P
[13:03:43] <bacon> Well, it seems we can't be friends.

[13:12:29] <Activ8> lmao that was funny
[13:16:24] <bookworm> if that's the next generation god help us
[13:21:27] <Activ8> takes time to learn though bookworm give them a chance
[13:21:30] <Activ8> :P
[13:22:30] <Activ8> hold their hand, give them a hug and tell them it's going to be alright.
[13:22:33] <Activ8>   Give a man a fish, he will eat for a day.  Teach a man how to fish he will eat for a life time. (I think that's how it goes) lol
[13:25:54] <bookworm> yes, problem is you aren't starting with a man but a blob of something that can barely understand words
[13:26:10] <bookworm> another option is to help Darwin along a bit...
[13:26:18] <bookworm> not sure which version is more successful :P
