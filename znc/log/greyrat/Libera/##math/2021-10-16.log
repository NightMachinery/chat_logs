[04:15:26] <Z-module> sorry, K = N\{3}
[04:21:14] <PlanckWalk> More directly you can say that nonempty H\K and K\H implies that H u K is not a subgroup.

[06:05:17] <damo22> if you take n -> infinity?
[06:06:02] <Guest2748> you just have to replace '1' on which everything else is built with another abstraction, say u for "true unity", where n * u = 1 but n is arbitrary and unknown. then re-define all maths in terms of the new unity u.

[06:28:12] <damo22> sin 2 pi x i mean
[06:31:34] <Guest2748> 2 = 1 + 1 and sin ~ e^(ix) where e ~ 1 + 1 + 1/(1+1)! + 1/ (1+ 1 +1)! + .... Therefore sin 2pix is just 1 + 1 / [( 1 + 1 ) + (1+1)] ! + 1 / [( 1 + 1 + 1) + (1+ 1 + 1)]! + ...!

[09:10:52] <isekaijin> I think the most natural reason for the order of operations is that, even when we build rings, we start with the additive monoid and then bolt the multilpicative structure on top.
[09:11:34] <isekaijin> In fact, one way to shorten the ring axioms is to say that, if you fix one factor, the map from the other factor to the product is an endomorphism of the additive group.
[09:11:56] <isekaijin> Or, more succinctly, “a ring is a monoid in Ab”.
[09:13:32] <isekaijin> So when you state the distributive property, “a(b + c) = ab + ac”, it actually reminds you that “a” can be seen as a group homomorphism applied to “b + c”.

[09:22:23] <Guest2748> x^y can make sense in an arbitrary ring if you defined the additive structure last

[09:24:21] <isekaijin> This already shows that exponentiation does not have all the usual properties when the exponents are not integers.
[09:25:47] <isekaijin> And we were not working in some exotic ring. This was in C, which is probably the nicest field that exists in the whole mathematical universe. (Characteristic 0, algebraically closed, metrically complete, etc.)
[09:26:22] <PlanckWalk> It's easy to define exponentiation of arbitrary ring elements. Just don't expect them to have any of the usual properties of exponents and wave your hands vigorously and say "tada!"

[09:29:07] <Guest2748> whats the algebraic limit of exponentiation in an arbitrary ring/field?
[09:29:26] <Guest2748> it's just something 'beyond' the field thats algebraically complete. a superset of C

[09:31:15] <Guest2748> isekaijin yes and algebraic completness did not make sense before Galois

[09:53:01] <Guest2748> geometrically*
[09:53:07] <isekaijin> Guest2748: Now, notice that real analysts deal with a lot of these issues by allowing functions to be defined on strict subsets of R^n, e.g., their square roots are defined only for nonnegative numbers. But in algebra, as a general rule, this is not considered acceptable. Algebraic structures are defined using operations with signature X^n -> X, where X is the carrier set.
[09:54:37] <isekaijin> The only exception that I can think of is that division in a ring requires the denominator to be nonzero. But singling out zero is much less drastic than singling out a complicated subset of the carrier - what is the analogue of “the nonnegative numbers” in your abstract setting?
[09:55:02] <isekaijin> (And notice that this already makes the category of fields MUUUUUUUUUUUUUCH less nice than the category of rings or the category of groups.)
[09:55:17] <isekaijin> Err, division in a field*

[12:51:10] <mh_le> indeed, I'm taking a course in quantum computing
[12:52:14] <mh_le> so I'm busy studying for the exam
[12:52:50] <greenbagels> ah right, did you ever resolve that density matrix question
[12:54:04] <mh_le> I did
[12:56:38] <greenbagels> glad to hear it
[12:57:10] <greenbagels> i really should learn about density matrices; that's one section i meant to read about but never did
[12:59:22] <mh_le> We went though some of the assignment in class, and I had done it correctly but perhaps in a bit more difficult way than nescessary

[13:25:14] <PlanckWalk> Separation does rely on specifying a superset, but Replacement doesn't.

[18:26:07] <stanrifkin> no one knows :)
[18:26:18] <cherim> Pegion hold is great
[18:26:27] <Z-module> The list  e = g^0, g^1, g^2, ..  has to have a repetition eventually, and (as you show) the first repetition must be some g^k = g^0
[18:26:34] <Z-module> that k is then the order of this g
[18:27:38] <[itchyjunk]> right
[18:28:24] <[itchyjunk]> https://www.dpmms.cam.ac.uk/study/IA/Groups/2021-2022/gps121.pdf
[18:28:33] <[itchyjunk]> 5 a) they pick a g for me. but what does it matter?
[18:28:52] <Z-module> g is arbitrary
[18:28:53] <[itchyjunk]> 5 b) they ask me to show it holds for all g. isn't it just semantics ? or am i missing something?
[18:28:59] <Z-module> This shows that *every* element of a finite group has finite order
[18:29:14] <Z-module> in (a), the n that works can vary with g
[18:29:23] <Z-module> in (b), they want a single n that works for all g
[18:29:28] <[itchyjunk]> ahhhhhhh
[18:29:59] <Z-module> If I had written this problem sheet, I'd have used a letter different from 'n' in that (b) there, even though it's not technically necessary.
[18:30:01] <[itchyjunk]> i guess this is poking at flt stuff which i don't remember. maybe it will come to me too
[18:30:18] <[itchyjunk]> right, that n threw me off
[18:30:25] <[itchyjunk]> glad i double checked though
[18:30:42] <Z-module> Well, you can avoid most stuff about groups for this (b)
[18:30:51] <Z-module> it's very basic
[18:31:13] <Z-module> it uses the fact that if  g^m = e  then also  g^(md) = e  for all natural d
[18:31:41] <Z-module> for (b), they're not asking you for the least n that is guaranteed to work.. they just want any single n that works.
[18:31:51] <Z-module> This fact makes it easier.
[18:33:45] <Z-module> We can generalize this exericse to:  If G is any (possibly infinite) group, and if T is any subset of G such that for each g in T, some natural n_g exists with  g^(n_g) = e, and if all these numbers n_g form a bounded set of natural, then some single natural k exists with  g^k = e  for all g in T.
[18:33:50] <[itchyjunk]> Heh, well if for every g there is some n_i such that g^(n_i) = e then take the product of all such n_i's then for any g in G, g^(product of all n_i) = e ?
[18:33:57] <[itchyjunk]> probably a nicer way to do it though
[18:33:59] <Z-module> This version doesn't even require <T> to be a finite subgroup of G.
[18:34:14] <Z-module> That will work, indeed.
[18:34:53] <Z-module> Ultimately you'll show that the number |G| works for the exponent every time, even though it's not always the smallest possible.
[18:37:10] <Z-module> On that (13) down there, I have to mention: If you change "infinite" to "uncountable" and "finite" to "strictly < |G| ", it turns out to be no for the abelian case, and yes (but quite quite difficult) for the nonabelian case.
[18:38:10] <cherim> (8*) is probably better than (13*)
[18:38:12] <[itchyjunk]> hmm the problem has an * next to it :s
[18:39:09] <[itchyjunk]> Do they expect me to get at |G| in 5 b)? or should i call my solution of multiply everything together good enough and move on?
[18:40:09] <Z-module> Your solution is fine.  Justifying |G| takes some actual group theory.
[18:40:22] <[itchyjunk]> ah, maybe later!

[18:53:56] <Z-module> If you like, avoid stuff about multiples of exponents and do 5b using pigeonhole on a bigger finite group. Say G = {g_1, ..., g_k} is a group, and now work in the larger but still finite group P = G^k (direct product of k copies of G). In this group P, take the single element x = (g_1,...,g_k) and now, as before, pigeonhole gives that x^m = x^n  for certain naturals m > n, so x^(m-n) = e_P = (e,e,...,e), so in fact (g_i)^(m-n) = e  for

[20:11:44] <Z-module> turns out to be all the things coprime to n
[20:12:16] <Z-module> this group is cyclic (so primitive roots exist) iff n is 2, 4, p^r, or 2p^r  where p is an odd prime, r any natural
[20:12:17] <[itchyjunk]> ah right. any multiple of n would be 0 mod n so non invertible..

[20:13:08] <[itchyjunk]> ahh right
[20:13:19] <[itchyjunk]> wait
[20:14:54] <Z-module> if n and k share a common prime factor p, then k invertible in Z/nZ means some m exists with    km = 1 (mod n)   which means  n | (km - 1)  so  p | (km - 1)  but this can't happen since p | k.
[20:17:03] <Z-module> actually, the common factor of k, n only needs to be > 1 for this to work, doesn't need to be prime

[20:19:09] <[itchyjunk]> seems something obvious
[20:19:09] <Z-module> If both hold, then p | km as well, then p | (km - (km - 1))   so  p | 1.  No prime does that.

[21:26:33] <qergle> cuppajoeman: right, they're linking it to area, as you saw when you learned integrals.
[21:27:41] <cuppajoeman> So a probability desnity function is a function so that the area in under the curve from a to b is equal to P( a <= X <= b)
[21:27:53] <cuppajoeman> Then we deduce that that area can be computed via an integral?

[21:28:37] <cuppajoeman> I guess I'm not fully getting the motivation
[21:28:38] <qergle> you added up rectangles, and then you got fancy and added up trapezoids, then centered them, etc etc
[21:30:02] <qergle> so the idea here being P(something) = area(something)/area(total)
[21:30:49] <cuppajoeman> and area(total) = 1?
[21:31:09] <qergle> and your something is some small interval around 70 (or in that author's case, to the right of 70), centered would be better approx.

[23:27:43] <Z-module> noobly:  "Then x \in \bar{B(a,r)} " is simply false.
[23:27:56] <dude12312414> it means every nonconstant polynomial in k[x] has a root in k
[23:28:12] <Z-module> sorry,   "Then x \in B(a,r) "  is what is false.
[23:28:44] <dude12312414> "nonconstant" is important, because 1 does not have a root in k for any field k :P
[23:29:33] <Z-module> For example if M is R (the reals), a is 0, r is 1, then the point 1 is in  \bar{B(0,1)}  but 1 is not in the open ball (interval) B(0,1)

[23:33:22] <cuppajoeman> ah yeah, that does make it clearer
[23:35:27] <Z-module> noobly: that proof you linked to is hopelessly wrong, it's not a matter of a typo. It totally fails to grapple with what it means for x to be in the metric (topological) closure of the set B(a,r)
[23:36:43] <Z-module> The correct proof uses the contrapositive, starting with some x *not* in the closed ball first. Meaning  d(a,x) > r.  Then you find a certain open ball that shows x is also not in the closure of the open ball.

[23:51:42] <Z-module> To provide what I hinted at, as a start example, let M = {all z in C : z = 0 or |z| >= 1} -- the plane with the standard open unit disk removed, but keeping the origin. With standard euclidean metric. Then B(0,1) -- all the points at distance less then 1 from the origin -- is just {0}. Every finite set in a metric space is already closed, so \bar{(B(0,1)} = B(0,1),  a one-point set.  But the closed ball  (\bar{B})(0,1)  includes the

[23:54:21] <cuppajoeman> The one where any two points have their own neighborhoods not containing each other
[23:54:42] <Z-module> T_2 is hausdorff. T_1 means for each two distint points, both have some open nbhd. not containing the other.    Fix any x in the T_1 space X, and now for each y != x, let U_y be some open set around y, not containing x.  THen   \cup_{y != x} U_y = X\{x}  is open.
[23:54:56] <noobly> Z-module: thanks for the explanation
