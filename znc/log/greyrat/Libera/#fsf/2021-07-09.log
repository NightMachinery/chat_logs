[05:57:31] <stormyknight3000> I am really getting annoyed by some institutions that I have to interact with on a regular basis
[05:57:56] <stormyknight3000> My bank, for instance, uses an email "encryption" tool which seems to be an outsourced proprtietary tool that is accessed through the web browser
[05:58:54] <stormyknight3000> when you recieve an "encrypted" email from someone at the bank, you are sent a link where you are required to sign up or log in to access the "encrypted" email that was sent to you
[05:59:39] <stormyknight3000> as best I can remember, it looked like anyone who intercepted the unencrypted real email that was sent to me containing the link could have signed up as me on that website and accessed the information

[06:00:05] <stormyknight3000> good thing this "email" only contained a PDF on how to wire money to my account
[06:01:18] <stormyknight3000> as far as I am concerned, i there is an added point of failure to the chain of information (non end-to-end encrypted communication accross the internet for instance), then there might as well be no encryption at all
[06:01:35] <stormyknight3000> the bank should have asked for my public PGP key and sent me an email using that

[20:45:47] <tpefreedom> The ability to monitor communcation and control it probably come hand in hand. You likely have the latter to some degree if you have the former.

[21:12:21] <rnek0> One of the reasons why young people are not interested in free software is : "games".
[21:12:37] <tpefreedom> Indeed.
[21:12:50] <rnek0> This is a Direct X dependency that is really strong and I think it should be carefully thought out. 
[21:12:54] <Noisytoot> There are free software games

[21:14:33] <craigt> rnek0, Noisytoot: Hello! Welcome to this week's Free Software Directory meeting.
[21:14:37] <meraziel[m]> SuperTuxKart with friends is a lot of fun
[21:14:46] <rnek0> Kids talk to each other, they form communities and want to play the same games as each other.
[21:14:52] <craigt> meraziel[m]: Hello and welcome!
[21:14:57] <rnek0> thank you craigt 
[21:15:10] <meraziel[m]> craigt Thanks!
[21:15:28] <rnek0> Unfortunately they are commercial targets.
[21:16:14] <tpefreedom> Supertuxkart is really awesome
[21:16:32] *** Joins: RedSoxFan07 (~Thunderbi@d-159-250-218-50.ct.cpe.atlanticbb.net)
[21:18:29] <craigt> There are some good games out there, https://directory.fsf.org/wiki/Category/Game but I sadly have to agree with rnek0.

[21:19:34] <rnek0> meraziel[m]: My son was playing SuperTux 13 years ago and he was 5 years old, now it's not the same. Not all children have the chance to experience Free Software. Even with Steam it's not easy.
[21:20:15] <meraziel[m]> Do you think it would be a good Idea for the FSF to start doing some official STK (and other libre games) tournaments?
[21:21:02] *** Joins: chomwitt (~Pitsikoko@ppp-94-67-202-202.home.otenet.gr)
[21:21:08] <Noisytoot> there was a LibrePlanet Minetest server
[21:21:40] <meraziel[m]> rnek0 That's really nice, but yeah... Proprietary Software is everywhere, and the social pressure makes it worse :(
[21:21:51] <tpefreedom> I think a free software Steam replacement with free software games would be more appealing to more mainstream pc gamers than a bunch of standalone games.
[21:22:25] <Noisytoot> package managers already exist
[21:22:55] <rnek0> sorry, but i think only that is important that the childrens know free software, not only university students
[21:23:01] <tpefreedom> The extra features steam has over normal package managers/app stores might still be more appealing to windows gamers.
[21:23:14] <Noisytoot> What are the extra features?
[21:24:07] <meraziel[m]> Noisytoot: Social features and a store where you can buy/sell in-game items
[21:24:09] <rnek0> sorry i haave bad english so i spend time to understand
[21:24:40] <tpefreedom> Steam has more integration with the games. It tracks play time, achievements, platform wide social features. It's more than an app store and launcher.
[21:27:24] <rnek0> In another way we have Raspberri pi that would be a springboard for young people at school.
[21:28:07] <Noisytoot> both play time and achievements can easily be faked
[21:28:18] <rnek0> These are just two ideas that I would like to launch.
[21:28:26] <tpefreedom> Maybe a free steam replacement could also have antimicro integrated. That could expand native controller support or improve support for keyboard and mouse if that's your thing. (This could also ensure you don't have a situation where the goddamn analog sticks refuse to work.)
[21:28:26] <Noisytoot> I think buying/selling in-game items is a waste of money
[21:28:48] <meraziel[m]> Noisytoot: I agree, but it is a popular Steam feature

[21:29:00] <tpefreedom> rnek0, the raspberry pi is far from the best freedom wise among the single board computers.
[21:30:09] <craigt> We are into hour two of this week's Free Software Directory Meeting. If you are new or just want a refresher, check out the participation guidelines. https://directory.fsf.org/wiki/Free_Software_Directory:Participate We also have the directory-discuss mailing list which you can sign up for at https://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/directory-discuss
[21:30:27] <meraziel[m]> tpefreedom: There's the BeagleV board, which is RISC-V instead of ARM
[21:30:42] <tpefreedom> !!
[21:31:43] <rnek0> You understand my idea, even if it's not Raspberry pi it has to be accessible
[21:31:55] <panosalevro> i submitted https://directory.fsf.org/wiki/Duktape
[21:32:01] <panosalevro> working on more entries
[21:32:08] <tpefreedom> So maybe something based on a Rockchip SoC?

[21:37:27] <craigt> rnek0: Free Software Directory (FSD) :)
[21:38:11] <tpefreedom> It catalogs free software. (At least for GNU/Linux)
[21:38:15] <meraziel[m]> panosalevro: Duktape sounds really cool! And easy to implement 😮
[21:38:20] <rnek0> I am new here
[21:38:21] <craigt> rnek0: It is why we host this weekly meeting. It gives us a chance to work on entries, ask questions of admins and webmasters (if they are available).
[21:38:51] <craigt> rnek0: https://directory.fsf.org
[21:39:29] <rnek0> i need a little time to my learning curve of FSF :)

[21:44:46] <meraziel[m]> Can I submit a project if it is only available over on Github?
[21:45:24] <meraziel[m]> It is released under a Free License (`MIT License`)
[21:45:38] <craigt> meraziel[m]: The only criteria is that it must be free software. <https://directory.fsf.org/wiki/Free_Software_Directory:Requirements>
[21:45:43] <rnek0> I have closed all my repos on github & gitlab.
[21:46:12] <craigt> meraziel[m]: Does it have any dependencies?
[21:46:18] <meraziel[m]> craigt: Alright then, thanks :-) 
[21:46:24] <craigt> thank ggoes!
[21:46:27] <craigt> *thanks
[21:47:10] <meraziel[m]> craigt:  it is a rust program, so it depends on some rust crates. I did look them up, they all have free licenses as well
[21:47:21] <rnek0> maybe i can help someone reading code
[21:48:15] <rnek0> i love rust meraziel[m] :)
[21:48:22] <thomzane> We are almost at our first fundraising goal of USD 50,000!  https://www.fsf.org/appeal  Who will be the one that makes the donation that reaches the goal?
[21:48:44] <craigt> meraziel[m]: I'm currently looking at cargo, but I'm not that familiar with rust.
[21:48:58] <thomzane> meraziel[m]: Is there an easy way to check rust dependency licenses?
[21:49:27] <thomzane> popsicle has 200+ dependencies.
[21:49:30] <meraziel[m]> craigt: Cargo is like some sort of package manager for Rust. Do you know Python's Pip? It is really similar 
[21:49:52] <Noisytoot> thomzane, I think dependencies have a license field
[21:49:56] <meraziel[m]> thomzane: You can read more about the crates at https://crates.io/

[22:05:11] <craigt> specing: What's this now? :) Like this? https://www.gnu.org/software/repo-criteria-evaluation.html
[22:05:11] <panosalevro> nope, another library called libjpeg
[22:05:59] <panosalevro> https://ijg.org/files/
[22:06:03] <kompowiec> apps on MIT license is allowed?
[22:06:47] <specing> craigt: yes, but for projects
[22:06:52] *** Quits: xx (~xx@user/xx) (Quit: xx)
[22:08:18] <specing> craigt: so projects get a separate rating depending on how free they are, how free the primary repository host is, how free the tooling they use is, how free the communications are (e.g. a lot of free software game projects sadly embraced Discord)
[22:08:21] <craigt> kompowiec: Hello and welcome to the meeting. Yes, https://directory.fsf.org/wiki/License:Expat is a FSF approved free software license.

[22:08:51] <specing> s/free/libre/ heh, I should stop using the word 'free'
[22:08:54] <kompowiec> real public-key steganography
[22:09:58] <craigt> kompowiec: Sure, get the entry up and an admin will review it.
[22:10:16] <meraziel[m]> What is the "License verified by" field?
[22:10:24] <meraziel[m]> Should I leave it as it is?
[22:10:42] <kompowiec> my regret for stego it always the same: by knowing the algorithm, you break security. It's different here. And this is fucking awesome
[22:10:49] *** Parts: ansgar (~ansgar@user/ansgar) ()
[22:10:51] <craigt> meraziel[m]: That is for the person who verifies the license.
[22:11:40] <thomzane> meraziel[m]: Put your name or nick there.
[22:11:51] <meraziel[m]> Oh, okay
[22:13:02] <craigt> thomzane: Thanks. Sorry meraziel[m] I just stated the obvious. :)
[22:13:26] <meraziel[m]> Haha :) 
[22:14:28] <rnek0> kompowiec: SteganoGAN is good for next european communications :D
[22:14:29] <craigt> specing: ahh. I understand now.
[22:14:47] <kompowiec> rnek0: yeah but still is one issue: key exchange
[22:15:12] <rnek0> PgP keys ?
[22:15:50] <craigt> panosalevro: Looking at libjpeg
[22:15:59] <kompowiec> in the case of encryption, both parties explicitly inform each other that they are exchanging keys. In stego, It doesn't make much sense in this way.
[22:16:50] <rnek0> you don't need to exchange keys if you know mail keys
[22:17:02] <kompowiec> hm...
[22:18:15] <craigt> panosalevro: I'm trouble find the code base for libjpeg. Do you have a link?
[22:18:31] <thomzane> Another cargo dependency checker: https://github.com/Nemo157/cargo-lichking
[22:18:47] <kompowiec> suppose you use this program, how will you inform the interlocutor that you have used it? You must have a pre-shared-key otherwise I can't see the way.
[22:19:34] <tpefreedom> Does anyone have an update for the project to create a free/libre ebook reader?

[22:26:00] <Anonymous_> Idk meraziel[m] I know eff, but I dont know how can we got some open hardware working, I started to think about this after receiving a email in libreplanet mailing list inviting people to climb the ladder

[22:27:43] <Anonymous_> I have seen a thread about RISC-V yesterday in lainchan, China(hwauei) started to put money on this after being banned of ARM usage and other problems
[22:27:52] <Anonymous_> Its a problem to post links here?
[22:27:59] <panosalevro> craigt: it's not. the date on that is 2008. latest release is 2020
[22:28:13] <craigt> panosalevro: I see.

[22:32:01] <craigt> panosalevro: I just keep guessing and sending links until I randomly hit it! :P
[22:32:18] <craigt> panosalevro: that last one does looking promising though.
[22:32:32] <rnek0> I think you have one toml file to spécify the crate version thomzane : https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/specifying-dependencies.html
[22:32:48] <panosalevro> craigt: yes, thats it. finally
[22:33:08] <panosalevro> i had actually checked that file but somehow couldnt find it again
[22:33:20] <panosalevro> but i think it's from here https://ijg.org/files/
[22:33:36] <panosalevro> anyway, take a look at the README file. what license is that?
[22:33:41] <thomzane> rnek0: Right, but the toml file that calls memchr 2.4.0 is for a dependency.  Not sure how to set subdependencies.
[22:34:35] <rnek0> may be you need to look at toml file of your dependency
[22:35:53] <rnek0> see at crates.io
[22:36:17] <thomzane> I see cargo-tree can lists a dependency tree.  Compiling cargo-tree.
[22:36:29] <thomzane> crates.io does not work without js.
[22:36:29] <craigt> panosalevro: I don't recognize that license. It looks like a home-brew.
[22:36:52] <craigt> panosalevro: home-brew? I don't know if that is the right word.
[22:37:15] <panosalevro> you mean a custom, made up license? i think so too
[22:37:40] <panosalevro> it most likely is free, but i dont know what to choose in the dropdown options

[23:24:34] <huria4> What if I'm the copyright holder for said GPL/LGPL code? Does update b, update a, and update r to program foo make it a modified work if I'm the original copyright holder?

[23:25:59] <jxself> Does making changes mean that you're changing it and that the program is therefore changed? :)

[23:26:19] <craigt> jxself: Hi! How's it going?
[23:26:28] <jxself> Oh just fine. :)
[23:26:41] <wheeler> Thanks craigt and meraziel[m] -- sorry for jumping in during the meeting
[23:27:18] <meraziel[m]> No problem wheeler :-) 
[23:27:27] <craigt> meraziel[m]: Looks good. The next step is verifying all the dependencies are licensed as free software.
[23:27:38] <craigt> wheeler: No problem at all. Glad you stopped by.
[23:28:34] <meraziel[m]> craigt: According to cargo-licenses, the dependencies are under Apache-2.0 and MIT licenses, I'm double checking at crates.io just to be sure.
[23:29:22] <craigt> meraziel[m]: Fortunately, Noisytoot brought https://lib.rs/ to my attention. This way you can check without using nonfree Javascript.
