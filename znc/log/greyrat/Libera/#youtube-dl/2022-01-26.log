[05:15:10] <babyface> JackFrost, yeah but it only fixed the problem partially
[05:15:22] <JackFrost> Awwwh, unfortunate.
[05:15:46] <JackFrost> I just saw the .3 release and the changelog had several twitter fixes.
[05:29:24] <babyface> JackFrost, I take it back. I tested  v1.20.2
[05:29:24] <babyface>  yesterday but didn't know that  v1.20.3 was released today and it fixes the problem :)

[20:19:30] <ianliu> https://termbin.com/94h8
[20:19:42] <ianliu> I've truncated the "segments" keyword
[20:19:53] <ianliu> to fit the pastebin
[20:20:21] <ianliu> could I download every segment defined there and concatenate them all to get an mp4?
[20:21:49] *** jrayhawk_ is now known as jrayhawk
[20:25:30] <ede> ianliu, is this from the http://ix.io/3NzE video?
[20:25:50] <ianliu> yes
[20:25:58] <ede> oh, could be the webplayer doesn't use the m3u8 thing, but that other one
[20:26:09] <ianliu> I've noticed that when I press the Play button on vimeo, it first makes that request
[20:26:41] <ede> there's that other thing based on something XML, i just can't remember it ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[20:27:25] <ianliu> maybe vimeo is changing the way it loads the video? :P and youtube-dl hasn
[20:27:30] <ianliu> hasn't catch up
[20:27:56] <ede> what i did was to get the JSON and from there the master playlist

[20:28:32] <ede> and from there selected the 360p. which both (with and w/o the parameter) point to the same segments

[20:29:06] <ianliu> and your urls didn't exist?
[20:29:14] <ede> i've seen some other sites too using different methods than master.m3u8 etc... i think i never had to use it
[20:29:46] <ede> 1-10, 39, 4764 existed :)
[20:36:36] <ede> hm, doesn't look better for the 1080p stream.

[20:58:02] <ianliu> I've parsed the JSON from the termbin paste, and now I'm downloading all the files from there. I've seen that this is a DASH mp4 file. How do I glue them together? It seems there is a base64 encoded string in the json as well, called "init_segment". Should this be prepended to the multiple files?
[20:58:05] <ianliu> dunno

[21:29:00] <ianliu> horayyy, managed to download all the segments and concatenated with the initial segment. Now the video is working :P
[21:29:10] <nimaje> ianliu: that is dash, but put into json (for whatever reason), for some other site I hacked together an extractor parsing that
[21:30:21] <nimaje> you can use and adapt https://0x0.st/ooCe.py to fix the vimeo extractor, but no idea if that is the working version
[21:33:10] <ianliu> nimaje: I've made a very simple python script to download everything. But my script doesn't know how to generate the URLs, so I generated the first urls by navigating to the website, and then running my script
