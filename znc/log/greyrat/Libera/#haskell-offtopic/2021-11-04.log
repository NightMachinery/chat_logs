[00:37:12] <monochrom> Perhaps not very constructive rambling but: Most FPers are inexperienced in formal methods, consequently have fantastic imagination that Curry-Howard implies that type theories/systems can solve every problem.
[00:37:47] <monochrom> Whereas those of us in the minority who have actually studied and/or used formal methods know:
[00:38:00] <monochrom> A. Even formal methods are not silver bullets
[00:39:11] <monochrom> B. And yet, there is a wide spectrum of formal methods of various power-to-weight ratio you can choose from, and all of them are better than hinging everything on types.
[00:41:22] <geekosaur> did you intend that for #haskell?
[00:41:59] <monochrom> I think of it as tangential to what's being discussed in #haskell.
[00:42:38] <monochrom> I don't want to, like, discuss general types and formal methods in #haskell without referring to a single token of Haskell code...

[02:06:48] <janus> monochrom: but if Voevodsky develops mathematical foundations based on type theory, couldn't that be a sign that type theory has potential? he didn't get the Fields medal from 'most FPers'
[02:08:06] <janus> there are not many programming technologies/frameworks that can be applied to other disciplines like that. FPers are right to pat themselves on the back
[02:08:28] <monochrom> foundation of math ≠ specifying and verifying programs
[02:09:42] <janus> ok but that's not what you said. i am reacting to "FPers [...] have fantastic imagination [...] [implying] type theories can solve every problem"
[02:09:59] <janus> and now it seems that type theory can in fact solve more problems that it is currently commonly applied to
[02:10:07] <monochrom> The context is specifying and verifying programs.
[02:10:49] <monochrom> "every" means, in context, "every but constrained to the context of specifying and verifying programs"

[12:52:48] <tomsmeding> [exa]: dminuoso: so certain lawyers say that informing is probably sufficient, but people here disagree? Is that an okay rough summary?
[12:53:40] <tomsmeding> I'm of a mind to remove all the profiling stuff and go back to plain day-by-day logs -- though with searching and more css than tunes
[12:54:22] <tomsmeding> but I doubt whether that will actually help for the GDPR as literally interpreted; processing is not really less important than profiling in the text as far as I understand from discussions and reading only small parts myself
[12:55:01] <tomsmeding> but merijn raises a valid point about judges' interpretation /= literal text meaning, but at that point we can do basically nothing apart from trusting lawyers -- as merijn said
[12:55:23] <dminuoso> tomsmeding: Honestly, if informing was ever enough, facebook wouldn't require your explicit consent.
[12:55:25] <dminuoso> ;)
[12:56:06] <dminuoso> And even the official gdpr.eu website, which is an EU funded project to explain GDPR, is very explicit that you need freely given (!) consent

[12:58:27] <dminuoso> Silence or inactivity on the part of the data subject, as well as merely proceeding with a service
[12:58:28] <dminuoso> cannot be regarded as an active indication of choice.
[12:58:33] <tomsmeding> right
[12:59:19] <tomsmeding> I wonder though, if someone should at some point litigate against ircbrowse -- unlikely but technically possible -- what would that mean for irc logging in general
[12:59:34] <dminuoso> tomsmeding: By the way, I want to stress that in no way I want to push you to disable it. To me, this is just gaining insights into GDPR and what is allowed and what not.
[12:59:40] <tomsmeding> I know "your claim would also apply to others" is not a valid counter-argument, but still
[12:59:44] <dminuoso> Me personally I couldn't care less :)
[13:00:01] <tomsmeding> dminuoso: thanks, and I figured :)
[13:00:43] <tomsmeding> but I do feel like "doing the same as 100 others" is some form of protection against litigation against specifically me
[13:00:56] <tomsmeding> statistical protection, not legal protection
[13:01:10] <dminuoso> tomsmeding: The reality is that there's so many GDPR violations, and only very few are pursued. So that defense wouldnt hold for long.
[13:01:16] <dminuoso> Ah.
[13:01:18] <dminuoso> Yes.

[13:02:19] <dminuoso> I want to emphasize that the profiling isnt even clear
[13:02:25] <dminuoso> That one is definitely room for interpretation
[13:02:36] <dminuoso> profiling is usually meant in the sense of "I want to figure out your hobbies"
[13:03:06] <dminuoso> ‘profiling’ means any form of automated processing of personal data consisting of the use of personal data to evaluate certain personal aspects relating to a natural person, in particular to analyse or predict aspects concerning that natural person’s performance at work, economic situation, health, personal preferences, interests, reliability, behaviour, location or movements;
[13:03:32] <dminuoso> Is my activity on IRC a personal aspect? Ill leave that to lawyers and judges to interpret.
[13:03:40] <dminuoso> It's not even clear to me
[13:03:49] <merijn> I mean, odds of enforcement correlate strongly with "amount of ire you inspire in regulatory agencies/individuals"
[13:04:07] <dminuoso> Multiplied by the dark pattern factor you have.
[13:04:25] <merijn> Well dark patterns are what piss off regulators :p
[13:04:47] <tomsmeding> which is a good thing
[13:04:59] <dminuoso> Speaking of dark patterns. Ever tried to delete a reddit profile from a mobile device?
[13:05:02] <merijn> We really don't have a consensus on what's "ok" in general and the GDPR is overly broad to avoid looholes
[13:05:25] <merijn> So it mostly about the *spirit* of the GDPR, then the literal letter
[13:05:53] <dminuoso> App doesnt allow you to delete a profile, only the website does. The website constantly redirects you back to the app (if you have it installed). Trying to delete requires setting a password, which can only be done in the app. Then you log in again, which redirects you back to the app. Then you need to provide the username, which is not visible and requires interaction
[13:05:58] <dminuoso> That interaction redirects you back into the app
[13:06:00] <merijn> Which was sort of what I was getting at with the "no reasonable expectaiton of privacy" on IRC yesterday.
[13:06:10] <dminuoso> And once you finally solve all puzzles, reddit constantly givesd you mysterious internal server errors..
[13:06:14] <merijn> dminuoso: Imagine using the official reddit app like a dummy...
[13:06:17] <merijn> lol
[13:07:28] * merijn still uses the unofficial app he's been using since, like, 2012/2013 which has introduced exactly 0 changes that affect how I use it :>
[13:07:51] <dminuoso> merijn: But yeah. Which is why I think if tomsmeding provided explicit notice in the topics, perhaps even saying that silence consitutes consent, provided a withdrawal option, chances are in the slim chance a regulator notices, you might just get off with a warning.
[13:08:23] <dminuoso> Since the website runs no ads and has no monetarization, I think nobody would ever pursue it
[13:08:26] <dminuoso> There's bigger fish to fry
[13:08:59] <tomsmeding> fair
[13:09:00] <dminuoso> But I think explicit withdrawal would be most important. At the very least you should have the ability to easily withdraw your (never given) consent.
[13:09:05] <dminuoso> And transparency
[13:09:15] <tomsmeding> what would withdrawing consent mean, for ircbrowse?
[13:09:26] <tomsmeding> blank all messages containing said nick? How do I authenticate?
[13:09:37] <tomsmeding> What about the osounimd thing?
[13:09:44] <dminuoso> Well something as simple as possible to withdraw the consent (that I never gave) to process and store my personal data
[13:09:54] <dminuoso> Could be perhaps an IRC bot where you just wrote
[13:10:01] <dminuoso> !withdraw_consent
[13:10:15] <tomsmeding> point is, what should happen then
[13:10:30] <dminuoso> It should make ircbrowse stop storing your messages and profiling your data
[13:10:39] <dminuoso> That is, the processing of personal data must stop
[13:10:46] <dminuoso> Since you no longer have a legal basis to do so
[13:10:53] <tomsmeding> right, and messages _to_ you are not your personal data?
[13:10:58] <tomsmeding> or _about_ you
[13:11:32] <dminuoso> The definition leaves a lot of room for interpretation here.
[13:11:33] <tomsmeding> what about Guest35 doing that and withdrawing consent for future, unrelated users of said nick? Though perhaps this case doesn't really matter
[13:11:38] <dminuoso> But I dont think this applies
[13:11:56] <dminuoso> Otherwise facebook could *never* do anything, unless it had consent from *every* person that someone could write about
[13:12:23] <dminuoso> Say, if I wrote a message to you about merijn, it'd be silly for facebook to require a legal basis to process (store), say via consent from merijn, to store my message.
[13:12:45] <tomsmeding> fair
[13:13:43] <dminuoso> though arguably
[13:13:50] <dminuoso> you might have legal basis:
[13:14:03] <dminuoso> processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party or in order to take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract;
[13:14:23] <dminuoso> Or
[13:14:25] <dminuoso> processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data, in particular where the data subject is a child.
[13:14:38] <dminuoso> I think that last one gives you legal basis.
[13:14:40] <tomsmeding> seems feeble to me
[13:14:52] <tomsmeding> "legitimate interests" covers basically anything
[13:14:59] <dminuoso> Sure
[13:15:01] <dminuoso> But:
[13:15:08] <dminuoso> "except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data, in particular where the data subject is a child"
[13:15:19] <dminuoso> Welcome to the legal world I guess
[13:15:26] <tomsmeding> so apparently "interests of the data subject which require protection of personal data" covers all the stuff that the GDPR wants to prohibit
[13:15:46] <tomsmeding> which doesn't help in making the ircbrowse case any clearer IMO
[13:15:52] <dminuoso> Writing laws is a very complicated thing. If you're too narrow, you exclude things you didnt consider, if you're too broad, you encompass too much and leave too much wiggle room for interpretation
[13:16:16] <tomsmeding> yeah
[13:16:32] <tomsmeding> happy I'm a programmer and only have to convince a computer that I'm right
[13:16:45] <dminuoso> Usually it works the other way around
[13:16:56] <dminuoso> The compiler tries to convince you that you're wrong.
[13:17:05] <dminuoso> :p
[13:17:36] <tomsmeding> luck would have it that the compiler is deterministic :)
[13:17:51] <tomsmeding> but yeah I might set up such a withdrawal thing
[13:18:04] <tomsmeding> might be as easy as requiring people to say "ircbrowse_tom: withdraw consent"
[13:18:23] <tomsmeding> and then the application, upon seeing that in the logs, puts the nick in the forbidden list
[13:18:32] <tomsmeding> then I don't actually need to make a bot
[13:19:20] <tomsmeding> but I don't have time for that today :p
[13:22:44] <dminuoso> tomsmeding: Now, perhaps a proper integration might actually use an IRC bot, that would ask a user upon joining or talking for the first time for consent
[13:23:24] <tomsmeding> I agree, but that goes on the list for after this term is over :p

[13:37:43] <__monty__> Fwiw, I think all of the arguments in the GDPR discussion are pretty weak. Nicknames being identifiable because you consent to make them so on a different platform (Github) is already weak and the foundation for everything that follows.
[13:38:48] <__monty__> What *is* a much more real liability is copyright strikes. But that way lies madness because copyright is insane.
[13:39:33] <dminuoso> __monty__: Online identifiers are explicitly named in GDPR.
[13:39:36] <tomsmeding> who has copyright on what here, exactly?
[13:40:03] <__monty__> tomsmeding: Anyone who says something that could be considered original.
[13:40:07] <dminuoso> __monty__: And Im not sure its weak either, because you are only identifiable because you chose to disclose identifying information in the first place.
[13:40:21] <__monty__> dminuoso: They are named but IRC nicknames can be claimed by anyone.
[13:40:33] <tomsmeding> __monty__: so what about literally any other chat platform :p
[13:40:59] <dminuoso> __monty__: So can any online identifier.
[13:41:01] <__monty__> tomsmeding: Copyright applies to all of them. It's horrifying tbh.
[13:41:07] <dminuoso> There is no global authority for *any* online identifier
[13:41:11] <tomsmeding> in which case facebook will suffer before I do
[13:41:15] <dminuoso> In fact, there's not even a global authority on names.
[13:41:20] <tomsmeding> hence I don't worry about that
[13:41:21] <dminuoso> So Im not sure what your point is
[13:42:02] <dminuoso> A name can be claimed by anyone too
[13:42:13] <__monty__> dminuoso: That's not entirely true. We have eID that give us actually identifiable online identifiers. Many banks have similar mechanisms that would definitely count as identifiable online identifiers.
[13:42:44] <dminuoso> Im almost concinved that this is not what GDPR had in mind.
[13:42:46] <__monty__> dminuoso: Yes, that's why even if a nick is someone's given name it's not necessarily identifiable.
[13:42:54] <dminuoso> Their main target group was facebook/twitter/friends.

[13:43:53] <__monty__> Yes, exactly. Hence why focusing the discussion on an IRC logging service is very LARP-y in the first place.
[13:44:29] <dminuoso> No Im saying, anyone can pick a twitter handle too
[13:44:53] <dminuoso> And yet Im very certain that this "anyone can chose that twitter handle" is precisely what GDPR had in mind when it comes to online identifiers
[13:45:02] <__monty__> Yes, but they can become identifiable if media reports on them for instance.
[13:45:17] <dminuoso> What does it matter why I am identifiable?
[13:45:38] <__monty__> It matters a lot because the GDPR doesn't protect you from yourself.
[13:45:39] <dminuoso> The GDPR doesnt seem to give interpretation room that identifiability is only relevant if it happens unwillingly
[13:46:01] <__monty__> If you choose to publish sensitive private data on Twitter then Twitter isn't liable for that.
[13:46:31] <dminuoso> The reality is that people tend to use the same online handle on multiple places
[13:46:34] <__monty__> It's not about it happening unwillingly. It's about identifiability being there at all.

[13:54:02] <__monty__> That's not how it works afaik (not a lawyer). You would first have to demonstrate the GDPR applies. Which means you need to demonstrate the nickname *is* identifiable. And that there's personal data involved, note that messages in public channels are very unlikely to be personal data. You are choosing to publish those. Including timestamps when others receive your messages. (Which is the 
[13:54:08] <__monty__> profiling that's been mentioned at heart, right?)
[14:00:09] <dminuoso> __monty__: I dont need to do this, the regulators do.
[14:00:29] <dminuoso> __monty__: And if what you said was right, twitter would be *ripe* to do whatever they want
[14:00:46] <dminuoso> Since a) all you write is publically readable (minus private chats, which we can safely ignore)
[14:00:50] <dminuoso> and attached to online handles.
[14:01:35] <dminuoso> So does twitter process personal data?
[14:01:43] <dminuoso> Their lawyers definitely seem to think so.
[14:05:05] <merijn> dminuoso: Twitter also records your date of birth, location, real name and tons of other things
[14:05:31] <merijn> And they're obviously not gonna bother with a separate GDPR workflow for people who don't set any of those things
[14:06:03] <dminuoso> Let's do this
[14:06:14] <dminuoso> Surely there are official guidelines on what an online identifier is
[14:06:25] <dminuoso> And what applies
[14:08:31] <dminuoso> __monty__: So https://gdpr.eu/eu-gdpr-personal-data/ has a lot of insights here
[14:08:48] <dminuoso> There are more factors to consider with indirect identification. Indirect identification means you cannot identify an individual through the information you are processing alone, but you may be able to by using other information you hold or information you can reasonably access from another source. A third party using your data and combining it with information they can reasonably access
[14:08:50] <dminuoso> to identify an individual is another form of indirect identification.
[14:09:18] <dminuoso> "Any information that can lead to either the direct or indirect identification of an individual will likely be considered personal data under the GDPR."
[14:09:43] <dminuoso> And also:
[14:09:46] <dminuoso> An individual is directly identifiable if you can identify them using nothing but the information you possess. In the previous example, by knowing his name and location, you were able to directly identify Robert. However, a name is not always necessary. Had you not known Robert’s name, you could have still identified him through his proximity and some combination of physical factors,
[14:09:48] <dminuoso> like height and hair color.
[14:10:12] <dminuoso> Adding the fact that IRC users tend to share the same online identifier across many platforms, you can quickly accumulate data points and *identify* a person
[14:10:24] <dminuoso> And the notion if identifying is elaborated upon a bit earlier
[14:10:31] <dminuoso> Calling someone by their name is the most common way of identifying someone, but it is often context-dependent. There are millions of Roberts in the world, but when you say the name “Robert,” generally you are trying to get the attention of the person you are facing. By adding another data point to the name (in this example, proximity), you have enough information to identify one
[14:10:33] <dminuoso> specific individual. These data points are identifiers.
[14:11:01] <dminuoso> I find it hard to not see how this would be personal data.
[14:13:28] <lortabac> btw on IRC you can identify people directly with /whois, if they have set their name and surname (some people on #haskell do have this information available)
[14:13:32] <dminuoso> __monty__: And you mentioned that IRC being public would provide an exemption. If you just google for "personal data" and "public domain", you can find a long list of legal opinions that suggest being in public domain is *not* an exemption
[14:14:36] <dminuoso> Im still curious whether Googlebot is GDPR conform in that sense
[14:18:38] <dminuoso> There's simply nothing in the GDPR to support your claim at all, __monty__.
[14:18:56] <dminuoso> As in, can you point to any definition/exemption in the GDPR?
[14:19:41] <dminuoso> Because GDPR is very explicit about "data processing is lawful only if..", so you need to have some explicit exemption in material/territorial scope
[14:19:49] <dminuoso> Otherwise it's simply unlawful

[14:22:42] <merijn> lortabac: Yes, but IRC hosts/servers can obviously justify using the "contract basis" for lawful processing
[14:23:41] <lortabac> merijn: I was just responding to the objection that nicknames only allow identifying people indirectly though Github
