[04:00:26] *** Quits: oxum (~oxum@106.203.195.217) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[04:01:03] <TimMc> If you put it in localstorage, then it's *definitely* susceptible to XSS.
[04:02:55] <Hash> TimMc: how?
[04:03:43] <shad> TimMc: react escapes anything you throw at it, so how would that work ?
[04:03:46] <TimMc> Well, there's only one way to get something into the localstorage, and that's via Javascript. So if you use localstorage for the token, it's basically by definition vulnerable to XSS (if there's a XSS vulnerability, of course).
[04:04:34] <shad> That's my point exactly, why do I bother with httpOnly cookies if the only threat to localStorage is XSS, if XSS cannot happen ?
[04:04:39] <TimMc> shad: While it is indeed wonderful that React escapes things for HTML by default, there can still be XSS vulnerabilities.
[04:05:18] <Hash> localStorage.getItem(someitem)
[04:05:26] <Hash> You need to know the item
[04:05:30] <Hash> For one
[04:05:40] <Hash> You need the unique identifier
[04:05:47] <TimMc> Sooner or later you allow an <a href="javascript:...">...</a> or use a library that uses dangerouslySetInnerHTML or some such.
[04:06:06] <Hash> I mean it's possible, to read/write local store with js, but I'm talking about cross site.
[04:06:27] <Hash> How exactly would that work? You'd have to disengage multiple types of internal protections
[04:06:35] <Hash> You have CORS for one
[04:06:43] <Hash> You have cross site js disabled by default
[04:06:48] <TimMc> Hash: "Cross site" is a misnomer. The name XSS is probably never going to go away, but it is better termed a "javascript injection vulnerability".
[04:06:55] <Hash> Ohhh
[04:06:57] <Hash> Ok.
[04:07:03] <Hash> Then I can see how it would work.
[04:07:08] <Hash> The whoel cross site confused me.
[04:07:22] <TimMc> Yeah, it's not a good name. :-/
[04:07:27] <Hash> Hey thanks
[04:07:29] <shad> I got my flask app to output a ̀`Set-Cookie:  accessToken=eyjf....` header, but i don't know how does that work in a React PWA
[04:08:31] <TimMc> There's this newer feature that you can lean on, called SameSite cookies or something like that. It's a pretty solid CSRF protection, but only works in newer browsers. Worth it, though.
[04:08:39] <shad> I don't know how to set it as a `Authorization: Bearer ${cookies.accessToken}̀  nor how to move from the login page to the application reserved space
[04:09:04] <shad> That does work only if the API is behind the same host, which it isn't
[04:09:40] <shad> The idea is to have the front behind `shad.io` and the api at `api.shad.io`
[04:09:57] <Hash> I owned #crypto
[04:10:11] <Hash> The ##crypto people asked me to forward it, so I dropped it, let them manage it
[04:10:20] <Hash> I think ##crypto also moved to #crypto
[04:10:38] <shad> Also i want to deploy production in a kubernetes cluster, i don't know if it makes sense to still use cookies

[04:16:14] <TimMc> An HttpOnly cookie and appropriate CORS settings on the API server is probably sufficient.
