[00:46:53] <konubinix> To me, "philosophy" is about understanding things, not deciding what to do
[00:47:23] <konubinix> Deciding what to do is the topic of politic
[00:48:37] <konubinix> As an example, "philosphy of nature"  is the study of the world around us. It as been renamed physics since a long time ago
[00:49:55] <konubinix> Also, it looks like we could not infer what ought to be out of what is -> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Is%E2%80%93ought_problem
[00:51:48] <konubinix> So to me, this is more a question of opinion, unless you are asking why it cannot be done otherwise as using links. But that seems to me like a strange question.
[00:54:12] <konubinix> Ok, I think we all understood what you were asking. But I wanted to remind out that philosophy is much more than "opinion" or "way of life", even though a lot of people use it with that meaning
[00:54:48] <konubinix> Likewise, it would not come to you to qualify this question of scientific I suppose
[01:02:03] <konubinix> Actually, you are trying to understand a thing. So this could actually be called a philosophical question, couldn't it?

[16:04:30] <peutri> yeah that was higher-level philosophy than I could handle
[16:07:39] <peutri> my “understanding” aspect of it was just that though: why would a roam ref have to be a link?  In my usage of it, it just needs to be an identifier that provides grouping
[17:28:37] <konubinix> roam_ref are used, among other things, to provide ref links
[17:29:42] <konubinix> Meaning, when the content of a roam_ref of a note A is in another note B, then B is listed in the reflinks of A
[17:30:37] <konubinix> Because org-roam rely on org-element for the parsing, it is "easy" to list the links of a page an find the reflinks
[17:31:52] <konubinix> If the content was just plain, without org-element considering it in particular, org-roam would have to "grep" a note against all the roam_refs to find ref links
[17:32:18] <konubinix> I this this is doable, but way more difficult than forcing roam_ref to be links
[17:32:47] <konubinix> I did not contribute at all to org-roam, so this is just speculation
[17:33:09] <konubinix> But it sounds quite realistic to me
[17:34:03] <konubinix> At least, I think I would not have implemented it otherwise, or I would have a hard time finding reflinks
