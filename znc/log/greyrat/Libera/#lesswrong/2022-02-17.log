[01:28:18] <zebrask> "The constant shift of the cumulative point estimate of the association between skin cancer and sunscreen use towards the null hypothesis value through the 1990s may be partly explained by the improved efficacy of sunscreens in protecting against solar UV radiation, particularly UVA rays, and the growing public awareness of the risk of excessive sun exposure" ‚Üí Hmmm..
[01:29:06] <gwern> ...how would the sunscreens improving in efficacy make the correlate go away?
[01:30:31] <kuudes> iirc it was before that sunscreen ~ skin cancer, because being in sun -> sunscreen and skin cancer
[01:30:34] <zebrask> I don't know. It would probably increase the dose response, so maybe there's a much smaller threshhold.
[01:31:04] <kuudes> so if sunscreen got better, sunscreen !~ skin cancer because only sun -> sunscreen anymore
[01:33:05] <zebrask> That... is consistent with what they are saying, but it's still a bit mind-boggling that before 1990 the studies indicated that the more sunscreen you use the more likely you are to get skin cancer and yet sunscreen use became way more popular over time.
[01:33:30] <kuudes> well the spurious correlation made perfect sense already
[01:33:54] <kuudes> ie at least over here the doctors just said that yeah, wear sunscreen but also don't tan
[01:34:10] <kuudes> and indeed that sunscreens should not cause skin cancer, it is just the sun
[01:35:53] <zebrask> Well yeah, but I don't really understand why they aren't mentioning any sort of controlled studies. Seems kinda simple to at least validate the hypothesis by showing, "Oh yeah most of this effect goes away when you control for how much time people spend in the sun."
[01:36:24] <zebrask> This paper is written in a super weird way, because they sometimes talk about the protective effect of sunscreen and sometimes the "association betwen sunscreen and skin cancer"

[01:42:22] <feepbot> least one king, tyrannical Yeonsangun, looked into the Annals, and this led to the First Literati Purge of 1498, in which one recorder and five others were cruelly executed because of what was written in the Sacho.

[01:56:11] <zebrask> IIRC there's some significant speculation about how bad Caligula, Commodus, Nero, etc actually were, because after they were deposed their political enemies wrote the histories of their time in office.

[02:35:44] <kuudes> in oulu we have little more than half of the students those people represent
[02:35:55] <kuudes> and we have 13 representatives, about double
[02:36:10] <kuudes> so per student, those there have 1/4 of representatives than here
[02:36:29] <kuudes> you guys have really few representatives at all levels, it seems to me
[02:37:16] <quanticle> Obormot\Arcturus: Yeah, and I'm pointing out that, in practice, "mobile first" means "mobile only".
[02:37:44] <kuudes> we have apparently some 36000 students in oulu in all levels
[02:42:30] <kuudes> I seriously think that many of usa's political problems could get less severe with factor of more elected positions. this would mean there would be less money at stake per each position, I would think
[02:43:23] <gwern> we already have 435 elected politicians in congress alone
[02:43:32] <kuudes> you should have about 1000
[02:43:40] <gwern> * House
[02:43:50] <quanticle> And become like Germany? Heaven forfend!
[02:43:52] <gwern> so then 535 with the 2x50 senators
[02:44:08] <kuudes> iirc it was so that uk and usa should about switch the represenative numbers with each other, uk has too much and usa too few
[02:44:17] <gwern> the problem is not that we don't have enough elections, it's that the power is unevenly distributed
[02:44:28] <kuudes> no, not elections
[02:44:31] <kuudes> representatives
[02:44:43] <kuudes> just choose more representatives in each election
[02:45:11] <kuudes> if the underlying popular opinion is the thing that is currently represented, nothing should change
[02:45:21] <gwern> right now, power in the US goes like this: "80% President; 10% current swing Supreme Court justice; 5% current swing senators; 4% current swing Representatives; 1% everything else / help me some political scientist / my democracy is dying"

[02:51:20] <quanticle> (And I'd like to keep it that way, tyvm)
[02:53:56] <gwern> my dreams are pretty interesting but after dream journaling for a while, I completely abandoned any idea that there was any meaning to them beyond simple reflections of anxiety and what was occupying my time
[02:55:13] <gwern> for example, last night I had a very long dream about Obormot and a Russian childhood friend who separated when they emigrated from russia, and the friend had Obormot's phone number in his cheap feature phone which crashed and erased it, and he was secretly in love with Obormot and after growing up dyed his hair red and became a mtf transsexual and then one night they met by chance on the subway
[02:55:22] <Obormot\Arcturus> ... wow
[02:55:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> That is way more exciting than my actual life
[02:55:36] <gwern> now, what does that mean? nothing. it just means that I spent a lot of time chatting with Obormot yesterday and I was also thinking about how easy it is to spot mtf trans online
[02:58:58] <quanticle> gwern: That's not a dream, that's just a mashup of the greatest hits of #lesswrong
[02:59:16] <gwern> like I said
[03:00:23] <quanticle> Yeah, fair enough. My dreams are literally just me talking to people in familiar environments about mundane topics. The only weirdness is that sometimes I wake up and realize, "Hey, that dream took place in high school, but I didn't meet X until college!"
[03:01:05] <gwern> tragic. maybe you should use more melatonin

[04:20:36] <quanticle> MrFantastik: Well, only if the federal government allows it.
[04:21:04] <quanticle> There's nothing about a CBDC that says that the underlying common ledger has to be a public blockchain
[04:23:16] <quanticle> And in fact, that's not how a CBDC is expected to work; the Federal Reserve doesn't want consumers to be opening accounts with it (which is, in effect, what it would be allowing if it sold DollarCoin directly to consumers). It wants people to use the existing banking system. So the way I see a central bank digital currency working in the US is that the there is a central ledger of some sort, but
[04:23:18] <quanticle> only authorized institutions (i.e. banks) get to write to it.
[04:23:52] <MrFantastik> like what jp morgan has then
[04:25:25] <quanticle> I'm not familiar with what JP Morgan has...
[04:25:51] <MrFantastik> I am not either lol but they have a crypto currency as well but its a non public ledger afaik
[04:26:31] <MrFantastik> and I could see every bank setting something like this up but it sounds like a colossal waste of time 
[04:27:20] <MrFantastik> could they in theory make it a public ledger where they always control the supply from a central authority?
[04:27:33] <MrFantastik> it would be interesting to have a government backed stablecoin
[04:28:29] <MrFantastik> or would their central authority over that ledger let them rewrite history and make it useless?

[10:06:23] <Robomot> Absement - Wikipedia (In kinematics, absement (or absition) is a measure of sustained displacement of an object from its initial position, i.e. a measure of how far away and for how long. The word absement is a portmanteau of the words absence and displacement. Similarly, absition is a portmanteau of the words absence and position.[1][2])

[10:55:04] <quanticle> Uhhh... there are a few
[10:55:06] <quanticle> David Friedman certainly does, for one. He says that the costs of global warming are negligible, and there will be benefits as he thinks that the increase in arable land opening up towards the polar regions will more than outweigh the decrease in arable land around the equator.

[13:18:02] <quanticle> feep[work]: Man, it's not even that I tried the very idiosyncratic open source thing. You *know* I'm competent with emacs. The thing that frustrates me is that all this *works* on Windows. And MacOS. Like, what the fuck?

[13:25:38] <enterprisey> I'm pretty sure all the underlying layers are perfectly capable of being more specific
[13:25:55] <enterprisey> it's just that the Cascade of Attention-Deficit Teenagers haven't attacked this one yet
[13:26:25] <quanticle> Are they? This is Gnome, after all. Maybe the error messages were all removed in one of their periodic refactorings.
[13:26:33] <enterprisey> and to answer the question, I prefer a blood-red fog of war effect on the screen, s'il vous plait

[17:23:36] <Obormot\Arcturus> Oh wow, Scott mentions antimemetics in that book review
[17:23:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> Amazing
[17:24:07] <feep[work]> unclear which sempai noticed which there
[17:25:10] <catern> PapuaHardyNet: interesting point. it would be good to survey all the different philosophies
[17:26:12] <catern> e.g. the vi-as-language philosophy: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1218390/what-is-your-most-productive-shortcut-with-vim/1220118#1220118
[17:26:13] <Robomot> vi - What is your most productive shortcut with Vim? - Stack Overflow (I've heard a lot about Vim, both pros and cons. / It really seems you should be (as a developer) faster with Vim than with any other editor. / I'm using Vim to do some basic stuff and I'm at best 10 ti...)
[17:27:29] <catern> or the derived philosophy that while vi is "verb object" word order, selection-based/region-based things such as emacs are "object verb" order
[17:28:10] <feep[work]> while we're on productive shortcuts, let me once again advertise my ctrl-e edit bind
[17:28:41] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Since everybody wants everybody else to be worse off, refuses to act openly on this, but dreams of having someone make them act, there‚Äôs widespread support for any limitation on human freedom, simply _because_ it‚Äôs a limitation on human freedom. We _are_ ruled by a bunch of psychopathic vampire elites, but it‚Äôs hard to be really angry at them. Society found some psychopathic elites sitting in vampire castles and
[17:28:41] <Obormot\Arcturus>  basically _begged_ them, ‚ÄúPLEASE take our freedom and make us worse off!‚Äù The psychopaths answered ‚ÄúI dunno, seems like a lot of work and we‚Äôre already pretty rich‚Äù, and Society was like ‚ÄúNo PLEASE we are _begging_ you!‚Äù and the psychopaths shrugged and said okay, you can have a _little_ oppression, as a treat."

[17:29:08] <catern> and anti-modal philosophies like the UI in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_Cat
[17:29:08] <Robomot> Canon Cat - Wikipedia (Canon Cat is a task-dedicated desktop computer released by Canon Inc. in 1987 at the price of U.S. $1,495. On the surface, it was not unlike dedicated word processors popular in the late 1970s to early 1980s, but it was far more powerful, and incorporated many unique ideas for data manipulation.)
[17:29:18] <catern> e.g. "The Cat also uses special "Leap keys", which, when held down, allows the user to incrementally search for strings of characters."
[17:29:27] <catern> but I'm not really interested in this lol so
[17:29:41] <catern> (this topic area of good UX for keybinds)
[17:29:48] <PapuaHardyNet> catern: afaict the best keybind UI/UX is doom emacs. for roguelikes I *think* dcss is great but I have a lot more experience with cdda
[17:29:50] <feep[work]> catern: that's what fuzzy find does
[17:30:21] <catern> feep[work]: it's not clear - you literally hold down the leap key while typing your search string
[17:30:35] <capisce> Bangkok is changing its English name to Krung Thep Maha Nakhon
[17:30:35] <PapuaHardyNet> so the thing is, there *has* to be common principles behind this. I can feel it but cannot describe it. something about symmetry and predictability combined with discovereability
[17:30:56] <PapuaHardyNet> big name for a big boy
[17:30:59] <feep[work]> catern: I mean, why not just press search key, type to find, press return to confirm
[17:31:16] <catern> feep[work]: because that would be a modal interface
[17:31:21] <feep[work]> um
[17:31:23] <feep[work]> holding a key is also a mode

[17:32:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> capisce: This is unacceptable
[17:32:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> What about "One Night In Bangkok". It'll be obsolete!
[17:32:16] <feep[work]> besides, holding a key is ergonomically horrible on the hand, regardless of what it does to the system
[17:32:29] <PapuaHardyNet> catern: danke, probably worth a skim at least
[17:32:55] <catern> admittedly, i have not read it
[17:33:25] <PapuaHardyNet> it's okay, when I say I will read something, it gets thrown into my reading_list.org for years
[17:34:04] <feep[work]> catern: okay, I've looked at the wikipedia article and I think this is just a bad idea.
[17:34:26] <feep[work]> or rather, it's a good idea that necessarily implies a bad implementation.
[17:35:05] <feep[work]> and I'm not convinced it's a good idea either! my expectation is if you habituate them enough there's no such thing as a constant physical action that cannot be backgrounded.
[17:35:22] <feep[work]> admittedly it's harder
[17:35:39] <feep[work]> but like ... I feel the intention should not be "this is memorable because it's physically difficult and borderline painful"

[19:18:45] <kuudes> but I don't appreciate those much, especially given we are now getting more than we can use

[19:35:42] <pompolic> government-assigned meat serial identifier
[19:35:49] *** Joins: schmudde (~schmudde@public.toolboxoffice.it)
[19:36:45] <zebrask> Colloquially you are right but I always feel like it's odd to say a name that millions of people assign to a specific individual isn't that person's "real name", particularly if they respond to it or use it themselves.
[19:38:55] <zebrask> Definitely there's a spectrum between a name used once to conceal your identity and full adoption and identification with a new name. Would be kinda nice to have better language around that (or at least less judgement about what names people use).
[19:43:13] <pompolic> i agree actually
[19:43:23] <pompolic> i just find it fun to assign new names to "name"
[19:43:30] <pompolic> well, "legal name", "real name", etc.
[19:45:11] <pompolic> i wonder if it's a spectrum though. that is, if it's one dimensional
[19:45:43] <pompolic> e.g. a vector of aliases with a degree of identification. that's still kind of a spectrum, right
[19:46:53] <pompolic> i think had in fact trained myself out of automatically paying attention to my legal name and its variants
[19:48:08] <PapuaHardyNet> how is that a good thing
[19:48:46] <pompolic> it's a very good thing that people can't automatically get my attention, from my perspective
[19:48:58] <pompolic> there is nothing preventing me from still responding to it
[19:50:59] <PapuaHardyNet> either you automatically pay attention to your legal name and its variants and you therefore can respond to it, or you do not pay attention to it, and therefore cannot respond to it
[19:52:11] <pompolic> no? does a particular word or sentence in a larger conversation never get your attention?
[19:52:50] <pompolic> by analogy: you can read IRC without every line pinging your client, right?
[19:53:21] <PapuaHardyNet> huh? IRC is async, conversations are sync
[19:54:10] <pompolic> well yes
[19:55:12] <pompolic> but still, in conversation there's still degrees of attention you pay to the topic at hand
[19:55:33] <PapuaHardyNet> if someone calls out my name and asks me a question, and I do not respond, there are consequences
[19:55:44] <PapuaHardyNet> I see
[19:55:46] <pompolic> yes
[19:55:54] <PapuaHardyNet> my attention is almost binary. Yours is not
[19:56:08] <pompolic> maybe? i think it's too binary in fact
[19:56:25] <pompolic> almost either complete focus or not paying attention
[19:56:48] <pompolic> which is why it's good not to have people be able to mash the "pay attention to me" button
[19:56:56] <pompolic> but i can still hear it and decide whether to respond
[19:57:46] <pompolic> at any rate, i only matter in this as an example to be dissected -- i think it's an ingrained habit to pay attention to one's name
[19:58:04] <pompolic> and one of the ways that habit might be loosened is by having more identifiers one is referred to? maybe?
[19:58:13] <pompolic> referred to by*
[19:58:43] <zebrask> Yeah I think it's maybe not a 1-dimensional spectrum but some higher dimensional continuum.
[19:58:44] <pompolic> so i think a continuous, rather than discrete model of identification with a name is appropriate
[20:00:13] <pompolic> hmm, a better analogy might be: when playing tabletop, people may refer to others in-character, i.e. using the name of the character rather than the name of the player
[20:00:23] <zebrask> Like "Ayn Rand" is something like a brand name but associated with a specific individual. It's persistent rather than ephemeral. I don't know what Rand used with her friends, so it could have been a personal use-name that corresponds with a brand or it could have been just a name she used with the public.
[20:00:29] <pompolic> seen the same happen in MMOs too
[20:02:16] <pompolic> in this case, the identifier may be as old as 2 hours ago, and yet people can still recognize being referred to (on the flipside, sometimes people are referred to in third person in conversation, without it being the equivalent of a ping)
[20:02:28] <zebrask> gwern's name is probably somewhere in the "brand name + use name + contextual name" space, I'm guessing?
[20:03:09] <zebrask> Whereas James S.A. Corey doesn't even refer to a single indivdual, so that's much closer to a pure brand name.
[20:03:34] <pompolic> "X name" sounds kiiind of like basis vectors
[20:03:44] <pompolic> of name-space
[20:03:45] * pompolic rimshot
[20:04:19] <zebrask> Someone who goes by "Jimmy" around their parents but "James" at work and maybe Jim with friends from childhood has mostly contextual names, but maybe the "James" one is a step into the brand space.
[20:04:51] <PapuaHardyNet> there is one way to solve the AI alignment problem
[20:05:08] <PapuaHardyNet> merge the consciousness of everyone into a hivemind and merge them with any possible AI model that is created
[20:05:13] <pompolic> persistence-ephemeralness seems like an axis that matters a lot

[20:05:26] <pompolic> i fear for the hivemind that integrates me
[20:05:55] <PapuaHardyNet> pompolic: okay hold on, what if you could choose the hiveminds you could integrate with
[20:06:15] <zebrask> Yeah, I think that "Is that your real name?" said with a sneer is usually intended to really ask, "Is this actually a persistent identifier for you?"
[20:06:18] <PapuaHardyNet> and also, what if you also had the choice to separate away (even if it may be messy)
[20:06:27] <pompolic> zebrask: it can also encode some extra info now that you mention: "timmy, can you come over here" vs "TIMOTHY FULLNAME, COME OVER HERE RIGHT NOW"
[20:06:46] <PapuaHardyNet> (would anyone want to separate after they were integrated into a hivemind? I doubt it)
[20:07:47] <zebrask> pompolic: Yeah, the context axis includes variants on a given name as well.
[20:08:51] <pompolic> PapuaHardyNet: to the extent i'm not being facetious, it's not that I'm averse to it (though I am), but i do think such process would be bidirectional, ie the hivemind would need to change to some infinitesimal amount to integrate a new mind
[20:09:21] <zebrask> We call each of my children by one of their middle names and they have unusual full names that most people don't know. I suspect that going forward, anyone who calls them by their first names, or anything addressed to their full names will be a strong signal that the person addressing them is a stranger.
