[02:12:24] <Bunny351> m455: this is not directly supported. you can generate an include file, though
[02:14:20] <Bunny351> that would be a nice egg, btw: add a virtual file system to a compiled file and access the data using various type-specific accessors.
[02:14:40] <Bunny351> there is sth like this for Tcl (surely for Python) and in Qt, too, IIRC
[02:14:48] * Bunny351 makes  a mental note

[04:14:29] <m455> Bunny351: ohhh what's an include file?
[04:14:49] <m455> thanks for getting back to me about this btw :)
[04:15:08] <Bunny351> sth you include with "include", insert a file into the currently processed (interpreted/compiled) file
[04:15:57] <m455> ohhhh hmmm like i could basically read the contents of a file at compile time and have that included? because i would be fine with that!
[04:16:09] <m455> otherwise i'll keep using string blocks haha
[04:16:19] <m455> because i'm equally fine with that xD

[04:21:14] <Bunny351> you could convert your data into a scheme file of the form (define my-data "...") and include it
[04:21:32] <Bunny351> or the string could be a bytevector, or whatever.
[04:26:23] <m455> Bunny351: yeah that's what i meant by a string block, so i have like a css file as (define css-contents #<<STRING-BLOCK ... STRING-BLOCK)
[04:26:25] <m455> thank you so much <3

[05:54:11] <knott> Hello
[05:54:21] <knott> anyone know how to get eval to work with csc?
[05:56:36] <knott> or if there is a more active place to talk about this stuff?
[06:06:52] <s-liao> csc work for compiling your scm source to binary code.
[06:07:32] <s-liao> knott  why do you need to eval to work with csc?
[06:24:23] <Zipheir> s-liao: I've edited the srfi-207 wiki page to be clearer.  It's correct that you can only put ASCII *characters* (< U+007f) in bytestrings.  Other characters up to U+00ff have to be written as hex sequences.
[06:25:49] <Zipheir> So #u8"¡" is invalid.  You have to write #u8"#a1".
[06:26:00] <Zipheir> Oops.  #u8"\xa1"
[06:27:37] *** Quits: knott (~user@c-73-254-91-24.hsd1.wa.comcast.net) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[06:27:51] <s-liao> Yeah
[06:28:38] <Zipheir> Ugh, I just noticed that hex escapes aren't working in the reader.
[06:31:14] <s-liao> Really.I have not tested yet.
[06:32:26] <s-liao> But, it is the Christmas Day. I thought that you have rest.
[06:34:07] <Zipheir> I'm just playing around.
[06:34:51] <Zipheir> It seems that the reader is interpreting the hex sequences before the bytestring parser can see them.  Hmm.
[06:36:57] <Zipheir> But yes, merry Lispmas, as jcowan says.
[06:46:06] <s-liao> yeah. There is parse-hex function in the parse.scm file in the package.
[06:47:58] <Zipheir> Oh yes, it works if you escape the backslashes: #u8"\\xde;\\xad;\\xf0;\\x0d;"  Then the reader passes them through.
[06:48:04] <Zipheir> But I'll have to fix that.
