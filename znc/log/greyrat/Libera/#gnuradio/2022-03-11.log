[00:57:32] <muaddib[m]> I use 2 pub sinks
[00:57:32] <warnes[m]> Nevermind, I see that my streams are tagged, and that that can be passed through ZMQ.
[01:03:33] <warnes[m]> I recently discovered Epiq's Sidekiq Z2, which combines a stand-alone computer and a capable SDR.   It looks like a great tool for building wireless devices, but has a high price tag.  The Pluto has a similar design but has much lower capabilities.
[01:03:49] <warnes[m]> Are there any other SBC+SDR devices around?
[01:07:16] <warnes[m]> Hmm. Google just turned up the Pluto+: https://qrznow.com/pluto-plus-sdr-an-adalm-pluto-upgrade/.   Anyone have any experience with one?
[01:10:15] <tnt> Embedded series from ettus.
[01:23:42] <Jacob[m]12> E310 tnt mentioned has been around for a while. There is also the AIR-T 
[02:36:10] <bpadalino> adrv9361-z7035 is another one but out of stock .. there's also an adrv9364-z7020 .. also out of stock .. 
[02:37:24] <bpadalino> https://vanteon.com/vnassa/ is one based on the adrv9002 instead of the 9361 .. they have different variants of the board
[02:38:15] <n1ai[m]> Myon:  A big group in the Hermes-Lite-2 community ( a great bang-for-the-buck SDR for HF ham radio! ) has been working the issue you are interested in.  This thread starts Jan 2021 and has detailed problem statements, measurements, prototype hardware, git repos with code changes, etc.  I recommend you go through it, even though it's a huge thread and at times a bit challenging to read...

[02:43:46] <bpadalino> it's probably worth noting that while there are caveats to the hardware/software integration, figuring out the signal processing part doesn't require any hardware
[03:14:44] <drmpeg> Why does everything have to be tiny with U.FL connectors?
[03:15:11] <bpadalino> i don't know .. but i hate it
[03:15:50] <bpadalino> i was working on something with an mmcx connector, and i bought cheap pigtails (bad idea) ..
[03:16:19] <bpadalino> the whole connector just came off inside the other connector and i had to use tweezers to try to remove it
[03:16:22] <bpadalino> was horrible
[03:18:11] <drmpeg> Yeah, U.FL is a big turn-off for me. You can still have a pretty small board with SMA connectors.
[03:18:45] <bpadalino> agreed
[03:19:40] <patchvonbraun[m]> The whole nano-ization where no nano-ization is necessary is just nauseating.  The U.Fl on the Lime boards?  Not really justifiable--the thing was never designed to fit inside a cell-phone case anyway, so why miniaturize to that degree?  
[03:20:38] <patchvonbraun[m]> Bad enough that all the passives these days are flea-snot.  Making connectors that only Venusian Micro People can use it absurd.
[03:21:35] <patchvonbraun[m]> Of course, I am nearly 60, and my eyesight isn't what it used to be, but, jeez.
[03:21:53] <bpadalino> u.fl connectors are cheap, i will say that .. so if you need 10 of them, it isn't too terrible versus 10 sma connectors
[03:24:01] <bpadalino> you know what, i retract that statement .. here's an SMA that's in stock at digikey and $1.82 .. thru hole solder .. and the u.fl were like $1 as well

[14:08:52] <LordKalma> the only way to use a LimeSDR is to get a case for it (you can 3 print one), and use pigtails, and *never* touch the U.FL's again
[14:08:59] <LordKalma> at work that's how we have the limeSDRs 
[14:09:36] <Yamakaja[m]> What's the reconnection count for U.FLs? I remember it being something in the low two-digits
[14:09:50] <LordKalma> for all practical purposes
[14:09:50] <LordKalma> 1
[14:10:26] <Yamakaja[m]> According to wikipedia "and they are only rated for a few reconnects (approximately 30 mating cycles[5]) before replacement is needed" ðŸ¤”
[14:10:54] <Yamakaja[m]> That's too low for a general purpose benchtop SDR 
[14:13:37] <LordKalma> https://i.imgur.com/8Z9Vl6z.jpg
[14:13:40] <LordKalma> we use these at work
[14:14:07] <LordKalma> _they_ use them, rather. I have no access to/use them
[14:17:24] <LordKalma> that one is mine because I was going to get a limeSDR and ended up with a b210
