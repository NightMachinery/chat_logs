[08:39:04] <MinusOne> when using hdparm to perform a secure erase on a disk, there is no progress feedback. Am I correct in assuming that this is simply because there *is* no way to query the drive for progress? Or is it possible, but not implemented in hdparm?

[09:01:34] <MinusOne> "purge" requires more specific approaches

[09:02:26] <MinusOne> Ideally, yes. They do outline broad stroke options. I am interested specifically in general purpose software-based approaches
[09:03:11] <MinusOne>  ATA secure erase is the most widely supported "purge" option for consumer sata drives
[09:03:51] *** Quits: mizu (~mizu@user/mizu) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[09:04:00] <MinusOne> cheapie, thank you
[09:04:07] <Dagmar> We used to have to go through this at a place I worked.  Simpler to just degauss most of the time
[09:04:14] <Dagmar> ...especially with older drives.
[09:04:25] <rascul> we had a box of drives to degauss
[09:04:29] <rascul> took it in weekly
[09:04:58] <cheapie> MinusOne: ATA ACS-4 standards appear to call for normal mode to actually physically write all zeros or all ones to all (non-reallocated) sectors, while enhanced mode is to fill all sectors (including reallocated) with a vendor-specific pattern.
[09:05:25] <cheapie> On the one SED I have here, normal mode is implemented as a full overwrite while enhanced mode just changes the key (and completes in under one second).

[09:07:54] <MinusOne> cheapie, well, I mean it simply isn't writing a vendor-specific pattern though
[09:07:56] <cheapie> As the key is now different, so the sectors are now all full of effectively garbage data - and "vendor specific" doesn't mean it has to be any fixed value.
[09:08:21] <MinusOne> but it isn't a pattern - although I suppose you can argue it simply isn't a repeating one
[09:08:29] <Dagmar> When something decent like AES is used, the ciphertext is pretty much indistinguishable from entropy by design
[09:08:36] <MinusOne> either way, knowing what drives are actually doing is more important than what the standard says
[09:08:54] <Dagmar> Meh.  Trust is for suckers.
[09:09:06] <cheapie> I haven't looked too much at non-SED drives, but the one I looked into wrote something like 0x55AAFF00 (repeating) across the whole drive for enhanced mode.

[10:51:38] <Gamah> what are you using to verify the file is changed? an editor that might not be reloading the file?
[10:52:33] *** Joins: c4017w_ (~c4017@209.52.68.8)
[10:52:44] <tusko> ok there's a file. I created a symlink to it. I changed that file a lot. I went to another computer with a brand new OS, and I created a symlink to the same file the other symlink points at. It gave me a very old version of the file. I went back to the first PC and have the updated version of the file at the symlink.

[10:59:23] <tusko> that's what I do. I need to take a few min to meditate on this problem.
[10:59:38] <tusko> many blessings to you kinds sirs
[11:00:16] <Sauvin> tusko, here's some meditation: a link (hard or symbolic) can only link to something on your local machine. With hard links, in fact, the link and its target have to be in the same filesystem.
[11:00:18] <jim> just to be clear, you mean a git pull?
[11:00:38] <Sauvin> When you link to a file like that, you're just creating different entry points into the same area where the file data itself are stored.
[11:01:04] <Sauvin> is/are/whatever.
[11:01:39] <EdFletcher> really this sounds like a problem with whatever cloud storage sync software you're using
[11:01:44] <EdFletcher> not the file links
[11:01:49] <Sauvin> Yup.

[15:49:14] <Farhad> I tried Voko"Something" App and It was just what I needed

[16:00:55] <libh> I got a question for any chromium users. It's becoming somewhat more common for websites to limit their support to google chrome and edge chromium. Could there exist a website that only works in chrome but not the open source chromium? Either by deliberate design or because browser incompatibility?

[16:01:37] <zer0python> sheep: and like I said, older hardware used the stack for function passing, so you just have to make sure when the code is compiled, it keeps track such that you aren't interfering with other functions.

[17:50:21] <phogg> Anova_: Windows has three "start on boot" mechanisms: services, msconfig-defined run actions (really in the registry), and start menu startup items. On Linux the first two are the domain of your service supervisor or initd (in some combination) and the latter, as with Windows, only happens after you log in.

[17:51:07] <Anova_> phogg, is there GUI software for Xubuntu that you know to do such a thing? under Windows it simply meant using the registry or startup folderr.
[17:51:10] <phogg> Anova_: your specific program may use any of these, or something else in between the first two and the last one. Depends on the opinion of whoever wrote it, and whoever packaged it

[17:52:38] <phogg> Anova_: in that case it still happens when you log in, but login happens immediately after boot

[21:36:35] <CuriosTiger> It's not random, but assuming nation-states aren't sending experts to try to find patterns of old data in the flux of the magnetic media, it's good enough.

[21:37:08] <CuriosTiger> heck, 1m probably does work on modern Solaris.
[21:37:12] <ornxka> CuriosTiger: obviously, but if you write over the /dev/mapper/$FOO device of a luks2 volume with /dev/zero, then the data on the underlying device will "look" random

[23:51:37] <NoMad20> cya guys, gonna watch F1 inside a windows vm over virt-viewer now. Thanks Sky for buying exclusive rights in Germany, then slapping DRM over it and not even giving OnDemand access. Best 15 bucks per month I've ever spent.
[23:51:47] <danieldg> lorens[m]: correct

[23:52:43] <danieldg> as long as none of the existing root processes can be convinced to do things for you, then you're good
[23:52:46] <Xeroine> Hello, took my SSD out and then put it back eventually. like a dumbass forgot to unplug PSU from power. now there are no directories in /home even though everything was on 1 partition and I get a "System reset" when trying to boot from SSD, it just reboots
[23:52:51] <Xeroine> any advice?
[23:52:55] <danieldg> that's how android works, after all
[23:53:01] <lorens[m]> adding a nosuid option to rootflags in the cmdline should work then.
[23:53:01] <rbox> Xeroine: did you try crying?

[23:53:55] <danieldg> Xeroine: mostly SSDs have hotplug support, so it may not be broken just because of htat
[23:54:01] <bertvvvs> I'd try chroot into it from a livecd or something
[23:54:09] <danieldg> but you've described a corrupted FS
[23:54:15] <filename> deaddvd
[23:54:28] <filename> so
[23:54:28] <lorens[m]> Dan39: trying to set up a VM sandbox, no point in making getting priv escalation in it easy even if it ought not to matter.

[23:54:36] <Dan39> Xeroine: the PC was shutdown though?
[23:54:41] <Xeroine> yeah
[23:54:51] <Dan39> then it shouldn't matter
[23:55:24] <Xeroine> it's a btrfs partiton by the way
[23:55:30] <Dan39> i swap out HDDs and SSDs daily to a PC when it is plugged in but shutdown
[23:55:39] <Xeroine> so I ran "btrfs check" on it
[23:55:40] <Dan39> never have an issue
[23:56:02] *** Quits: TheSilentLink (~TheSilent@user/thesilentlink) (Quit: Good Bye! My bouncer has probably crashed or lost connection to the internet...)
[23:56:03] <Dan39> i also hotplug with system booted, but i turned on hotplug in the BIOS. usualy it is off by default
[23:56:57] <Xeroine> alright

[23:57:15] <f843d0> bertvvvs: chrooting sounds a bit "overkilling", first of all it would be good if any initramfs can show detection on kernel level, and hopefully mount the resource and take a look
[23:57:16] <danieldg> yeah, I've installed and started using new disks in my desktop without rebooting before, pretty nice

[23:59:04] <lorens[m]> danieldg: if i also use the nodev option, would it interfere with /dev when it seems like the startup scripts mount it as a separate mount point? devtmpfs on /dev type devtmpfs
[23:59:11] <Xeroine> f843d0: how would I do that tho?
