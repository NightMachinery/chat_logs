[00:03:40] <pjb> IMO, the best thing Poland could do, is to build a certain number of direct highways, going from the German border to the Urkranian border, with only a single rest area with shops in the middle, and no way to go elsewhere.
[00:04:06] <pjb> This way, if somebody wants to make war to somebody else, they can cross Poland without having to invade it first.

[20:51:11] <gilberth> Well, if the store-vars of a SETF expansion would be a lambda list applied to the values to store, it would work.
[20:52:22] <gilberth> As it is, it only works when the number of values is known at compile time.
[20:54:02] <gilberth> Otherwise (SETF (VALUES-LIST x) ...) would work, which would be nice :)
[20:56:16] <humasect> cant you macro it
[20:57:40] <gilberth> How? Not with CL:SETF, it seems.
[21:08:02] <humasect> ah

[21:30:53] <aeth> gilberth: what I do is I handle the common cases, which in my case (linear algebra) would be 2, 3, 4 (with 1, just use ordinary SETF)
[21:31:27] <aeth> then the general case can be "loop unrolled" into 4 with, say, offsets
[21:32:39] <aeth> but that works because I expect it to be composed with functions that break up things into multiple value components
[21:32:57] <aeth> that is, for any MV-taking SETF macro, I have an MV-producing inline function
[21:33:03] <aeth> e.g. ARRAY-OF-2
[21:33:18] <aeth> (setf (array-of-2 foo) (array-of-2 bar)) is effectively just a copy
[21:33:53] <aeth> (setf (array-of-2 foo) (array-of-2 bar :offset 2)) copies starting at position 2, to e.g. treat the last 2 elements of a vec4 as a vec2, and then copy that into a vec2
[21:34:35] <aeth> if I had, say, a 4x4 matrix, I would just repeatedly apply array-of-4 (if represented 1D) or array-row-of-4 (if represented 2D) in a loop

[21:42:16] <aeth> gilberth: that's when you loop
[21:42:53] <aeth> gilberth: you assume (1) you don't know the values at compile time so it's probably large, (2) if it's large you probably want to iterate by 4, (3) this creates one special case in the loop (the last iteration, if its length isn't a multiple of 4)
[21:43:28] <aeth> it won't neatly compose with a multiple value accessor function, though, because there isn't much of a point for it at that point because returning 4,000 values is unlikely to be efficient
[21:44:23] <aeth> gilberth: I could probably write a do-array-by-4 or something, but you'd still need to handle the special case of the last iteration where 0-3 of those values are NIL and not what you expect.
[21:45:19] <aeth> users are likely to just want to write their own LOOP, although the final iteration would be tricky
[21:45:43] <gilberth> Why would I assume it's large?
[21:46:11] <aeth> What I mean is, to iterate, you'd just iterate on :offset (* i 4) or you'd :offset i and increment i by 4 each iteration
