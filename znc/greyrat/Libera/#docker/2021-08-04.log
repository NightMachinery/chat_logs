[00:45:14] <zoredache> Any ideas why a container would fail to start with 'address already in use', even though the container doesn't have any publish ports, or an `--ip` set or anything?
[00:46:49] <zoredache> the network it is set to connect to, should have lots of addresses unused, when I inspect the failed container the IP that got auto-assigned under IPAMConfig.IPv4Address is not in use.

[04:48:50] <Lutin> jochum which one /
[04:49:04] <Lutin> jochum not for all.. we have lots of small clusters
[04:49:12] <jochum> What is the best way...
[04:49:31] <Lutin> jochum that has nothing todo with k8s
[04:49:36] <Lutin> really nothing at all
[04:49:51] <jochum> Lutin: hmm I see
[04:50:00] <jochum> Lutin: I thought you want to connect multiple nodes togetehr
[04:50:20] <Lutin> no node, ldap/sssd to a container
[04:50:36] <jochum> Lutin: what about allowing internal traffic and have a firewall infront?
[04:50:44] <Lutin> k8s has too much overhead for clusters that are pretty static
[04:50:51] <jochum> k3s is very nice
[04:50:54] <jochum> from Rancherlabs
[04:51:09] <Lutin> still a lot of overhead comparing to a simple docker(swarm)
[04:51:22] <jochum> I have no clue about swarm
[04:51:29] <Lutin> then you can't say ;)
[04:51:34] <Lutin> I can, tested all
[04:51:36] <jochum> Tried it a while ago, found k3s - i'm happy
[04:51:51] <jochum> I don't like etcd
[04:51:55] <jochum> Takes a lot IO
[04:52:06] <Lutin> what has etcd todo with anything ?
[04:52:19] <jochum> K8s releays no etcd
[04:52:27] <jochum> relays ...
[04:52:33] <Lutin> ah yeah
[04:52:44] <Lutin> there are alternatives
[04:52:52] <Lutin> k3s has it's limits as well
[04:53:07] <jochum> Yeah?
[04:53:26] <jochum> We run a 8 node cluster just fine
[04:58:37] <Lutin> which is already pretty large
[04:59:22] <Lutin> at the end k3s is the best choice comparing to k8s but not to swarm when you need quick setups which we do

If I have several web services (containers) doing all kinds of things and running on different ports and such, but I want to expose them to the world through a single host and port in production, am I right in assuming that I should use something like nginx or traefik as a proxy?

[16:59:06] <Lyn> is it possible to set a variable within the docker-compose.yml file, such that I can set something like "services: service-name: build: dockerfile: [variable goes here]" for all service-names from a single line?
[17:02:02] <Lyn> I guess I can load a specified env_file and use the variables from there
[17:04:21] <tabakhase> Lyn no clue what you mean by "for all service-names from a single line" - but maybe have a look at yaml-anchors (".x-..: &name")
[17:05:26] <tabakhase> asside normal $vars work in a lot of places, but not everywhere if i remember correctly... 
[17:05:34] <Lyn> service-names would be api, client, nginx, postgres, that is to say I'd be setting up multiple containers and not just 1 called "service-name"
[17:06:26] <Lutin> I thought https://github.com/chaifeng/ufw-docker was working well together with defauot docker iptables but it seems it doesn't ?
[17:06:45] <tabakhase> last, compose can also deep-merge multiple yamls, "-f ... / COMPOSE_FILES envVar)
[17:07:22] <tabakhase> best would prob be if you can post an example :P
[17:09:35] *** esses is now known as ses
[17:10:12] <Lyn> just imagine the usual docker-compose.yml with at least 2 services with their respective dockerfiles specified, I don't want to fill the (exact same) dockerfile name for all the services separately (the files have the same name but are in different paths)

[22:18:31] <LoRez> anybody building things with kaniko in gitlab?
[22:22:20] <dreamer> we are migrating to kaniko. our new runners are on k8
[22:22:22] <dreamer> k8s&
[22:22:36] <dreamer> atm using docker:dind
[22:29:11] <BinarySavior> hi i'm running a docker container with official znc image (https://hub.docker.com/_/znc).  The documentation says to use external modules i will need to add the file to /znc-data.  I am currently running the image in detached mode.  How can I access the filesystem of my container?

[22:44:47] <zoredache> BinarySavior: Is your /znc-data a volume or bind mount already?  If a bind mount, just put it into the bind mount path. If a volume, I usually find it easiest to start up a temporary busybox container that with a mount for the volume, and a mount to some path on the filesystem, then copy/move/delete files as needed.
[22:45:33] <BinarySavior> i'm not sure if it's volume or bind mount.  but i just discovered the docker cp command
[22:45:35] <BinarySavior> i think that will suffice
[22:46:24] <zoredache> Sure, but if it isn't a volume or bind mount, remember any changes you make there will be lost if the container is recreated
[22:46:33] <tabakhase> if its neither you def want it to become one - or that folder is empty again on the next image-update :P
[22:49:16] <BinarySavior> tabakhase, i did container inspect | grep type and it is of type volume, idk if that's the best method to check
[22:49:19] <BinarySavior> i'm new to docker
[22:49:54] <tabakhase> its something you have todo when starting it, so check your "docker run" statement or potetnailyl the docker-compose file :P
[22:51:45] <BinarySavior> i ran it with -v
[22:52:26] <BinarySavior> i guess that means bind mount
[22:53:54] <tabakhase> -v can be both, depends on whats behind it :P
[22:54:41] <tabakhase> -v /bla:/moe = bind-mount --- while -v bla:/moe is a volume :D
[22:56:07] <LoRez> how do you sneak into the kaniko debug images to play with a shell?
[22:56:48] <BinarySavior> -v znc-cfg:/znc-data
[22:57:02] <BinarySavior> tabakhase, i suppose that would be a volume then

[22:58:37] <tabakhase> yep, and either be fine for you - so your docker cp is on the right track  ((if it where a bindmount, you could "normal cp" it on the host - but now you add a whole nother of complexity with chmods&ACL :P
[22:59:13] <tabakhase> somewhere far away there also is a performance difference - but lets talk about  this when you have a 500GB mysql in there or so, not few kbs of configs :D
