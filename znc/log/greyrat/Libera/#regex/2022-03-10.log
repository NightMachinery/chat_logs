[08:48:35] <sifsif> hey there! I had issue regarding '/' which are -
[08:48:36] <sifsif> 1. the string where a-z and '/' is allowed but must not start or end with a slash '/'
[08:48:36] <sifsif> 2. the string where a-z and '/' is allowed must not contain two consecutive slashes '//' anywhere.
[08:48:37] <sifsif> Thanks to @digitok who gave me the solution ^\b[a-z\/]{0,10}\b$ which covers problem 1. However, looks like it works for Java environment but not for Oracle pl/sql. so can you please help me how can I handle this in pl/sql? in 1 regex pattern by which I can handle both problem 1 & 2?

[09:55:28] <digitok> 07sifsif, oracle does not support word boundaries in any form as far as i can tell
[09:56:03] <digitok> can you move the max length logic away from the regex and instead add an additional check using LENGTH in your sql query?
[09:57:41] <digitok> and then you can use this regex ^[a-z]+(\/[a-z]+)*$

[19:07:46] <re101-sheep-35> ok

[19:08:59] <OnlineCop> `(?:https?:\/\/)?` right before the group `(?:...|(https?:\/\/)|...)` will allow 'https://https://' to match.

[19:09:42] *** Joins: KevinX (~KevinX@user/KevinX)
[19:10:49] <OnlineCop> Typically, email has '@' right before the domain and URLs have some protocol: 'http://', 'https://', 'ftp://', 'gopher://', etc.
[19:11:11] <OnlineCop> You might try looking for any of those, and then start capturing the rest of the text after it.
[19:11:20] <re101-sheep-35> OnlineCop I want to select link like goole.com www.dfd.com  https://regexr.com/ but not want to man@gmail.com
[19:11:55] <re101-sheep-35>  https://regex101.com/r/YhbLyz/1 edit this regex
[19:12:12] <OnlineCop> Since you're using ECMAScript (it allows variable-length lookbehinds), you COULD say `(?<!@\S*)`
[19:12:27] <OnlineCop> That would prevent 'foo@` before the 'example.com'
[19:13:34] <re101-sheep-35> also i want tot ignore text of inside of <a></a>
[19:13:42] <OnlineCop> There's also 'my.domain.example.co.uk' as valid domains (note '.co.uk. instead of simply '.com').
[19:14:06] <OnlineCop> `(?<![<][^<>]*)`
[19:14:51] <OnlineCop> Well, that would prevent text within '<a ...>' but not between <a> and its </a>, especially if there are nested <span> and other tags.

[19:15:43] <OnlineCop> Take a look at that !url page while I'm looking this over. You might want one of those solutions.
[19:16:03] <OnlineCop> Those match different types of URLs and/or email addresses, for different regex flavors/languages.

[21:18:00] <OnlineCop> {min[,[max]]}
[21:19:13] <OnlineCop> `min` is required. If the comma is supplied, `max` is used if supplied or "infinite" (or the equivalent of `(unsigned)-1`) is used.

[21:51:50] <causasui> yup
[21:52:09] <causasui> https://regex101.com/r/Rs4bDw/1 in match 1, why is the K in group 1? I wanted/expected it to be in group 0
[21:52:57] <causasui> just noticed group 0 has a lot of whitespace in it, which wasn't intended either. I'm misunderstanding something
[21:53:28] <OnlineCop> Group 1 is `(\S)` which is a single character. Then that group uses `+` to match the next single-character non-whitespace, which clobbers whatever used to be in $1.
[21:53:37] <causasui> the groups I'd want to get would have ['BLK', '38;5;68'] and that's it
[21:53:42] <OnlineCop> You probably wanted `(\S+)`
[21:54:07] <causasui> yeah that does seem better
[21:54:32] <causasui> thanks
[21:54:42] <OnlineCop> You don't need a group around `(?:\s+)` if you're not going to quantify it.
[21:54:50] <OnlineCop> Just `\s+` there should be sufficient.
[21:54:59] <causasui> ah true
[21:55:14] <OnlineCop> For group 2, I'd even suggest `(\d{1,3}(?:;\d{1,3})*)`
[21:55:35] <OnlineCop> That is, you know that it's going to start with a digit. Then if it encounters a `;`, then expect 1-3 digits after it (always).
[21:57:30] <causasui> hmm
[21:57:38] <OnlineCop> In group 3, I try to avoid `.+` if possible. Unless you want '    garbage text or more command ### comments here' to match to the last '#' and then capture any text after it.
[21:58:21] <OnlineCop> Usually, a group is necessary if you want to quantify it (everything inside it needs to repeat N times) or use alternations (a|b|c)...
[21:58:51] <OnlineCop> The `(?:.+#\s+)(.+)` could lose the group and still have the same function: `.+#\s+(.+)`
[21:59:04] <causasui> yeah I am doing (?: too much
[21:59:15] <OnlineCop> It doesn't really change much, but it does drop the step count down in many cases.
[22:00:04] *** Quits: Floflobel_ (~Floflobel@cosium-fo-152-18.fib.nerim.net) (Remote host closed the connection)
[22:01:22] <OnlineCop> Version 1 takes 103k steps. With the change to `(\d{1,3}(?:;\d{1,3})*)`, version 2 drops to 99.5k steps. Simply removing the two unnecessary `(?:...)` groups drops it down to 78.8k steps.
[22:01:28] <OnlineCop> https://regex101.com/r/Rs4bDw/3 (version 3)
[22:02:40] <OnlineCop> The `.+` will match all characters to the end of the line, then start to backtrack until it can find the last '#' character. It could be faster to use `[^\n#]*#` to match until it encounters the '#'.
[22:04:25] <OnlineCop> Oh, I totally forgot to change `(\S)+` to `(\S+)` which drops version 4 (the above changes) from 78.6k (not a big drop from version 3) all the way down to just below 30k steps: https://regex101.com/r/Rs4bDw/5
[22:05:38] <OnlineCop> Finally, if you _know_ that those `(\S+)` will be at the start of the line, throwing on `^` to anchor it (and adding the '/m' flag so multiline is enabled) as in https://regex101.com/r/Rs4bDw/6, the total steps drops down to 14k.
[22:06:17] <OnlineCop> So... about a 7x speed increase.
[22:07:36] <OnlineCop> causasui: Do you know whether you have any edge cases where a line starts with '#' (with no space between it and the starting text right after it)? Such as: "#.sub   38;5;177" 
[22:08:10] *** Joins: lavaball (felix@31.204.155.215)
[22:08:12] <OnlineCop> If so, you could get rid of that by changing `(\S+)` to `([^\s#]+)`

[22:08:46] *** Joins: dandyn (~dandyn@user/dandyn)
[22:09:58] <purplex> if those # are comments then he can comment a line, and it will match = edge case
[22:11:08] <purplex> in python, no space is required after # to start comment
[22:11:47] <purplex> oh and that flavor is indeed python
[22:12:01] <purplex> so yep i'd use ([^\s#]+)
[22:12:04] <OnlineCop> I also didn't take into account # comments containing 2+ octothorpes: ##, etc.
[22:12:34] <OnlineCop> Looks to me like this is shell coloring code.
[22:14:12] <purplex> i can't see ## i tried #{2,}
[22:15:29] <OnlineCop> Yup. I also see a few '*.' plus extensions. Wouldn't the wildcard be implied?
[22:16:24] <OnlineCop> I can understand '*' followed by filenames, like "*id_rsa".
