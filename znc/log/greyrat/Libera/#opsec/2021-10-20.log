[01:50:35] <vaio> isn't that basic opsec ? ;p
[01:52:51] <catbeard> ^
[01:53:08] <catbeard> those that know, don't talk.  those that talk, don't know
[01:55:43] <Joanna> vaio: it’s possible to chat without revealing secrets. Being too quiet also arouses suspicion:) hence the invention of small talk
[01:58:21] <Joanna> Besides it’s possible to have a conversation about a topic without revealing important secrets
[01:58:57] <vaio> if you're used to that, indeed
[01:59:20] <vaio> well, ok, the only way to get used to it is to practice
[01:59:34] <vaio> so yeah... mmmh
[02:00:49] <catbeard> now the question is what shall we discuss
[02:01:25] <vaio> so, catbeard, where are you from ?
[02:01:26] <vaio> ;P
[02:01:45] <Joanna> Lol
[02:04:34] <catbeard> the internet
[02:05:15] <vaio> huh, so am i!

[03:33:49] <ilikeyou> oh i fancy secret channels
[03:35:49] <Joanna> I once had a unregistered secret channel that I would move occasionally whenever one of the members turned into a troll everyone but the troll would relocate and the inactive people and troll would stay put :)
[03:36:54] <catbeard> lol
[03:36:59] <Joanna> It was like the scorched earth policy for trolls
[03:37:49] <Joanna> I think my methodology for inviting people was not so good back then
[03:38:11] <Joanna> We had some entertaining chats though
[03:39:58] <Joanna> There are a lot of channels in irc where there are people who will bust up conversation that they don’t approve of it seems even if they are on topic.
[03:41:36] <Joanna> Same with forums... interesting conversations get locked and can’t continue.

[04:01:09] <catbeard> forums are cheap and you can put one up in like 5 minutes, and just link or post screenshots of the thread to continue it
[04:47:50] <Joanna> I dislike forums and try to avoid them..
[04:48:26] <Joanna> Besides people are kind of lazy and probably wouldn’t come.
[04:48:46] <Joanna> I can’t get forum people to come to irc for instance
[04:49:53] <catbeard> all the keyword stuff from spam forum posts kinda makes it annoying to search for things
[04:50:01] <catbeard> irc isn't really "searchable" historically
