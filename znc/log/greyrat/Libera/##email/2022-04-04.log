[19:39:38] <mage> hello
[19:40:47] <mage> I'm looking for advices about Dovecot redundancy. Currently I have an HAProxy in front of two Postfix instances (running in FreeBSD jails) who are pushing into an unique Dovecot backend (backuped through ZFS snapshots)
[19:41:16] <mage> I'm wondering how could I remove this SPOF (possibly with separate dovecot instances)
[19:41:29] <lunaphyte> there's a lot you can get into with that discussion, but i would suggest the short version is that you move the problem as far towards storage as you can
[19:41:47] <lunaphyte> so start by implementing redundant mx servers.  keep one dovecot
[19:41:50] <lunaphyte> get that working.
[19:42:17] <lunaphyte> then work on implementing redundant dovecot lda services.  leave the rest
[19:42:36] <lunaphyte> then work on implementing redundant other dovecot mechanisms
[19:43:01] <lunaphyte> piece by piece, you'll get the value, and it's an organic way to easily determine how far it makes sense to push it, in your particular scenario
[19:43:04] <mage> "redundant other dovecot mechanisms" ?
[19:43:20] <lunaphyte> e.g. imap, sieve, director, etc
[19:43:24] <lunaphyte> whatever you may be using
[19:43:33] <mage> ok
[19:45:03] <mage> also, I have snapshots every 5 minutes (and it's OK to loose 5 minutes of emails here), what about implementing something with CARP and devd events?
[19:45:36] <lunaphyte> you mean instead of haproxy?
[19:47:27] <mage> my HAProxies are already running in master/slave mode
[19:50:04] <thumbs> s/loose/lose/
[19:50:08] <lunaphyte> what would carp be for?
[19:50:17] <thumbs> yes, I wonder about the purpose of carp
[19:50:44] <mage> yeah, looks like I spoke too fast
[19:52:05] <mage> I mean, rather than starting with complex synching mechanisms for director instances, would it not be easier to simply have some node detection failure of the dovecot instance and simply start another one (jail) in which snapshots have been sent?
[19:56:59] <mage> also another question with no relation to the previous one: is it me of Office365 junk mail filtering is highly perfectible?
[19:57:56] <mage> we have a lot of legitimate messages coming from our host which ends in junk email folder 
[19:59:37] <lunaphyte> i can't parse that question
[20:04:08] <mage> a lot of mails which are sent from our host are flagged as "junk" emails
[20:10:02] <mage> https://www.bruceb.com/2020/04/whats-wrong-with-office-365-junk-mail-filtering/ looks like I'm not the only one..
[20:10:21] <lunaphyte> oh.  you're asking about deliverability
[20:10:32] <lunaphyte> yeah, it's an endless/impossible task
