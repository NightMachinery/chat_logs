[00:05:14] <shakygator> i know a guy named behrooz
[00:05:19] <bomb> CableNinja but when you think about it, beach balls aren't completely spherical either
[00:05:49] <CableNinja> thats only because they have to have the stupid flat pieces for the air nozzle
[00:06:18] <bomb> that's what she said ahahahaha
[00:06:29] <CableNinja> its also not completely spherical because of its design, which uses a spherical like template, but then has to deal with the weld
[00:07:24] <CableNinja> welp... idk what to do the rest of today

[00:11:48] <Hunterkll> "break glass in case of fire" on fire extinguishers
[00:11:51] <Kiernian> 1984 would be 5 1/4" floppies
[00:11:54] <Hunterkll> ^
[00:12:04] <monr0e> No I get that part, but I don't get the specificity of 1994
[00:12:09] <signalblue> yes
[00:12:20] <signalblue> 1984 is a George Orwell reference
[00:12:22] <Hunterkll> *shrug* why not, that was just before USB and in the full swing of widespread 3.5" 1.44 usage 
[00:13:13] <JollyRgrs> pft, even 1999 was still mostly floppies
[00:13:27] <signalblue> and so was 2003
[00:13:27] <Kiernian> shit, I was still using floppies regularly in 2008
[00:13:30] <JollyRgrs> i mean, that 8MB or 16MB usb drive was nice, but so expensive
[00:13:36] <signalblue> Kiernan: why
[00:13:41] <DrZak> Today I went full circle. I found my own answer on stackoverflow useful.

[00:13:47] <signalblue> ah
[00:13:53] <JollyRgrs> lol
[00:14:02] <signalblue> CD's are nice, but too fragile and write-once
[00:14:43] <JollyRgrs> CD-RWs were too fickle with what scenarios they could be used for what
[00:14:58] <signalblue> hard drives were the best
[00:14:59] <JollyRgrs> "oh, to use it here, you have to seal it off and basically make it a CD-R"... SO WHY DID I JUST BURN A CD-RW?!?!
[00:14:59] <Hunterkll> really depend on hwat you were buying/using
[00:15:00] <Kiernian> to say nothing of the whole +/- BS
[00:15:05] <JollyRgrs> lol
[00:15:07] <JollyRgrs> i remember that
[00:15:09] <JollyRgrs> omg
[00:15:24] <JollyRgrs> but hey, the upside was all the "free with mail-in rebate" deals on the 50 stacks of CDs
[00:15:37] <JollyRgrs> I don't think I bought more than 1 stack in my lifetime... the rest were all free
[00:15:55] <JollyRgrs> oh, those 48x are out of style b/c now we have 52x? i'll take them. ty
[00:15:56] <signalblue> usually I used HTTP to transport data whenever I had an internet connection
[00:16:20] <JollyRgrs> lol... http for 700mb?
[00:16:23] <JollyRgrs> that'd take forever
[00:16:27] <Hunterkll> omfg i remembe this
[00:16:32] <Hunterkll> that time I helped a scammer
[00:16:38] <Hunterkll> https://i.imgur.com/bq4SBbA.png
[00:16:40] <JollyRgrs> kinda like when i had to download HP AIO printer drivers at a customer's home on their DSL
[00:17:09] <signalblue> drivers are not 700MBs
[00:17:20] <signalblue> or even FTP
[00:17:41] <JollyRgrs> signalblue: the HP AIO software was like 600+MB

[00:19:45] <signalblue> copier with a nic
[00:19:57] <signalblue> and a crappy software to go along with it
[00:20:29] <JollyRgrs> so HP OJ AIO lets you scan to a network drive... basically no other (cheapish... ~$200 or so) device does that
[00:20:48] <JollyRgrs> they'll copy over network to a workstation with like... the epson softare installed... but not just direct to a SMB share

[01:11:46] <signalblue> @Killnine CloneZilla is the ultimate tool
[01:11:57] <signalblue> can be hard to use, but it will get the job done
[01:12:45] <Kiernian> clonezilla is finicky, but it works. If you're hoping to use it in case of emergency, test everything out first, figure out what settings work, and save them for said emergency.
[01:13:07] <signalblue> CloneZilla is basically modified Debian
[01:13:29] <signalblue> Similar to how Proxmox is nothing more than modified Debian
[01:13:46] <signalblue> Debian is great for modding/customizing
[01:18:37] <mistiryWifi> CloneZilla might use Debian at its core, but isn't "modified Debian". That's like saying SQL Server is "essentially modified Windows".

[02:00:14] <Hunterkll> overall, MSSQL is potentially faster in more use cases (versitility) and far more featureful, but not everyone needs taht, and not ever use case will see a performance gain from MSSQL (or might even see a loss)
[02:00:19] <Hunterkll> at the end of the day, it's best tool for the job

[04:57:34] <sd> 11<R​einitialized> ive learned so much and i havent even crossed my 90 days yet
[04:57:36] <kerat58> jay-rosWIFI in what sense?
[04:57:38] <sd> 09<S​killedAlpaca> MSP's are where you go to get enough experience to leave forever.

[04:58:16] <sd> 11<R​einitialized> i managed to work in getting two ferrets as part of my job offer

[04:58:34] <sd> 09<S​killedAlpaca> Here is something I'm confusaed about, I make 37.50/hour but my Gf who is going to be a certified vet tech will make a max of $30/hour doing work that saves animals lives.

[05:00:36] <mistiryWifi> definitely is

[05:00:50] <MikeSpears> I'm sorry but idiots don't exist (on this one) Just because someone sucks at computers doesn't mean they're better than you at something
[05:00:53] <jay-rosWIFI> women be all up ons when you mention you're an IT specialist
[05:00:54] <sd> 09<S​killedAlpaca> I got into IT because my parents wouldn't let me join the marines.

[05:01:03] <sd> 12<C​ardinal> Yeah, I know, idiots is rude, and not everyone is a computer expert
[05:01:06] <sd> 12<C​ardinal> we are all idiots

[05:01:12] <MikeSpears> everyone is good at something
[05:01:16] <sd> 12<C​ardinal> Yeah I know
[05:01:22] <sd> 11<R​einitialized> oh yeah, not saying theyre full blown dumb
[05:01:25] <sd> 11<R​einitialized> just IT dumb
[05:01:27] <MikeSpears> I'll be honest, I don't give a fuck if my doctor is good at computers
[05:01:30] <sd> 12<C​ardinal> But sometimes they come off as idiots.
[05:01:37] <MikeSpears> I care about him being good at medicine
[05:01:55] <sd> 11<R​einitialized> i had a lawyer who basically said "i can sue a guy and win all year long, but when it comes to this damn computer stuff, i just have no fucking clue"
[05:01:55] <MikeSpears> specialists tend to be good at one thing and one thing only
[05:02:11] <sd> 12<C​ardinal> Do people really need to be told that because someone is an idiot with computers that they're not worthless
[05:02:16] <MikeSpears> sadly yes
[05:02:24] <sd> 11<R​einitialized> call me insane, but i want to be a generalized system administrator
[05:02:26] <sd> 11<R​einitialized> and stay at that
[05:02:27] <sd> 12<C​ardinal> I dunno
[05:02:29] <jay-rosWIFI> I've miscategorised myself then MikeSpears... I'm terrible at everything but I give it a rock-solid go
[05:02:30] <mistiryWifi> Non IT people dont need to be experts at computers. But a basic level of computing knowledge these days for many jobs is required. 
[05:02:36] <sd> 11<R​einitialized> dont know why, but i enjoy having my hands in just about every aspect
[05:02:40] <sd> 11<R​einitialized> from software to hardware
[05:02:45] <mistiryWifi> Computers are tools for their jobs, and they should know how to use those tools.
[05:02:52] <sd> 11<R​einitialized> if i stick in one thing too long, i get too bored
[05:03:01] <kerat58> well, welcome to reddit-sysadmin, Reinitialized.  We'll believe you for real if you switch off Discord and onto classic IRC 
[05:03:06] <jay-rosWIFI> Reinitialized - have you tried polygamy?
[05:03:14] <MikeSpears> mistiryWifi: agreed. But degrading people isn't the way to solve that issue
[05:03:22] <mistiryWifi> I wasn't saying it was.
[05:03:26] <sd> 11<R​einitialized> oh ive been lurking here for a while, just mainly more active in the /r/homelab discord as thats where i started my IT venture
[05:03:26] <sd> 12<C​ardinal> I wouldn't call them an idiot to their face
[05:03:41] <sd> 11<R​einitialized> lol, im not that kind of idiot
[05:04:00] <MikeSpears> that's the problem we have. people with less tech knowledge get degraded either to their faces or behind their backs, and they become jaded and don't want to learn
[05:04:13] <kerat58> like all the users on discord for instance
[05:04:15] <mistiryWifi> It goes both ways, though.
[05:04:18] <sd> 12<C​ardinal> Everything I interact with is on Discord, this is the first server with some irc bridge
[05:04:21] <sd> 11<R​einitialized> well, theres people these days who genuinely dont know what a folder is
[05:04:26] <MikeSpears> I've convinced quite a few folks to actually like computers just by sitting down and working with them
[05:04:29] <mistiryWifi> If you've been told 10 times how something is done, and you still keep asking...thats a YOU problem
[05:04:31] <sd> 11<R​einitialized> i dont think its the people themselves, its how technology is progressing
[05:04:38] <sd> 12<C​ardinal> IRC is retro and independent and all
[05:04:38] <sd> 11<R​einitialized> its intended to be "just plain dumb"
[05:04:44] <MikeSpears> take a different tactic. Everyone can be taught
[05:04:49] *** Joins: llh (~UPP@user/llh)
[05:04:49] <sd> 11<R​einitialized> at least, on the front end
[05:04:50] <mistiryWifi> They have to put in effort, too. 
[05:04:57] <sd> 11<R​einitialized> the back end ... thats where we come in
[05:04:59] <sd> 12<C​ardinal> Yeah Mikespears that is what I do
[05:05:00] <mistiryWifi> Can be taught yes. Willing to be is the problem.
[05:05:11] <MikeSpears> everyone is willing if the right method is used
[05:05:18] <sd> 12<C​ardinal> I try to teach people how to do stuff, even if they don't want to, not to displace my responsibility but to make them a more powerful person.
[05:05:22] <mistiryWifi> Not in my experience.
[05:05:23] <MikeSpears> you gotta analyze the person to figure out how to teach them
[05:05:29] <sd> 12<C​ardinal> Some people are a lost cause
[05:05:45] <sd> 12<C​ardinal> Some people see you little more than a fix-it minion, but those are few
[05:06:34] <kerat58> Well one thing is for certain and it is that IT is being viewed as a serious problem solving profession by "the masses" now.  It was not all that long ago where people in business or sales departments within the same company I was working at would make derogatory comments about IT
[05:06:47] *** Quits: GWM (~GWM@user/gwm) (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
[05:07:03] <mistiryWifi> Do these people call an electrician to change a light bulb? Call a mechanic to fill their gas tank? No, they learned basic skills to address those things themselves. Similar with computers. In 2022, in an office job, your computer is the main tool you use to do your work. It is inexcusable, at certain levels and roles, to lack the most basic of knowledge on how to operate the main tool for
[05:07:05] <mistiryWifi> your job.
[05:07:56] <MikeSpears> agreed. however I feel like this problem exists because so many people never got formal training believe it or not
[05:07:57] <mistiryWifi> Computers are not a new thing anymore. Not understanding that the printer has to be powered on to work, for example, is inexcusable. 
[05:08:15] <cryptic1Wifi> so anyways back to these gold plated hdmi cables
[05:08:17] <MikeSpears> and there's telling someone how to do, vs educating them on how to do something
[05:08:17] <xe0n> hdmi cable is around the wrong way
[05:08:22] <xe0n> lol cryptic1Wifi ++
[05:10:21] <mistiryWifi> MikeSpears: The point being, educating users on the basic usage of the tool for their jobs isnt (or shouldnt) be what IT is focusing on.
[05:10:34] <cryptic1Wifi> mistiryWifi, +++
[05:10:38] <mistiryWifi> You think a welder comes on the job first day and goes "hey guys how do I turn on the welding machine?"
[05:10:47] <mistiryWifi> No, they expect he already knows that.
[05:11:15] <MikeSpears> then fix the problem. work with NPOs to create IT training programs
[05:11:26] <MikeSpears> sadly so many people even in their 20s never learned
[05:11:46] <MikeSpears> outside of smartphones/tablets
[05:11:48] <sd> 12<C​ardinal> I've learned is less of an age thing and more of a personality or mindset thing
[05:11:56] <mistiryWifi> I don't deal with users, so no thanks I'm not gonna go try to create a program to train them. 
[05:12:02] <sd> 12<C​ardinal> Lmfao
[05:12:20] <MikeSpears> I've literally seen people in their 20s have only used smartphones/tablets
[05:12:27] <MikeSpears> and have never touched a normal computer
[05:12:39] <mistiryWifi> And why does it become the responsiblity of their employer's IT department to teach that?
[05:12:41] <MikeSpears> maybe a chromebook
[05:12:41] <sd> 12<C​ardinal> Yeah they do not understand file directories and what not
[05:12:57] <MikeSpears> not saying it is. I'm saying the schools need to be teaching this shit
[05:13:23] <Riviera> mistiryWifi: because IT is responsible for providing the applications staff works with,
[05:13:30] <MikeSpears> stop teaching kids how to use iPads/Chromebooks and create mandatory computer classes
[05:13:32] <Riviera> mistiryWifi: and responsible for setting policies of usage.
[05:13:44] <MikeSpears> lobby the districts, work with NPOs to create change
[05:13:51] <MikeSpears> whatever it takes to fix the root issues
[05:14:11] <MikeSpears> chromebooks/tablets are great, but they're not the only things people should be learning
[05:14:12] <Riviera> mistiryWifi: so, whether a company uses the microsoft office suite or the google office suite, for example, depends greatly on IT (even though IT was not necessarily who made the actual decision),
[05:14:30] <MikeSpears> these people don't even know how to use the start menu
[05:14:40] <MikeSpears> because they've only seen an iPad or chromebook
[05:14:45] <cryptic1Wifi> That persons manager can assist
[05:14:57] <cryptic1Wifi> thats not on IT
[05:15:19] <Riviera> mistiryWifi: so it's the instance between user and company solution. so of course it's IT. it's IT saying how emails should be treated securely, and IT who says how email is being accessed (as examples). so, it should assist staff.
[05:15:26] <cryptic1Wifi> The manager made the choice to hire an unskilled staff member
[05:15:26] <MikeSpears> fixing it in the workforce isn't the solution tho. That's what I'm trying to say. As the stewards of the tech world, we need to be lobbying to fix these issues
[05:15:33] <Riviera> MikeSpears: exactly!
[05:15:56] <cryptic1Wifi> stewards of the tech world ... whaaaaaaaaat?
[05:15:56] <MikeSpears> we need to be educating people. working with non profits to teach literacy classes
[05:16:06] <cryptic1Wifi> What kinda place do you work at
[05:16:09] <Riviera> MikeSpears: so now suddenly, being a mac user, being confronted with windows equipment the company provided,
[05:16:10] <cryptic1Wifi> s/place/reality
[05:16:11] <layer8> cryptic1Wifi meant: "What kinda reality do you work at"
[05:16:17] <Riviera> MikeSpears: should somehow magically make me know of the start menu?
[05:16:21] <Riviera> MikeSpears: why?
[05:16:23] <mistiryWifi> way too many tags and messages to keep up
[05:16:47] <mistiryWifi> Riviera: im talking about basic computer knowledge. Not company applicaiton specific things, or policies, etc.
[05:16:48] <MikeSpears> Riviera: there's literally folks who've only used tablets/chromebooks. I blame the schools for this shit
[05:17:13] <Riviera> MikeSpears: i don't know why to blame anybody at all -- it's simply impossible to know all user interfaces
[05:17:28] <Riviera> MikeSpears: we have introductions for joiners on how to use Macs
[05:17:36] <Riviera> MikeSpears: because .. well, not everybody had used a mac before
[05:17:44] <MikeSpears> you're totally missing the point I'm attempting to make. THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO HAVE NEVER TOUCHED A STANDARD COMPUTER
[05:17:50] <Riviera> MikeSpears: i do not find that weird at all, and i think it's just the same as your start menu :)
[05:17:55] <MikeSpears> THEY LITERALLY DON'T USE A MOUSE
[05:17:57] <Riviera> MikeSpears: yeah
[05:18:03] <MikeSpears> I don't know anyway to make it simpler
[05:18:04] <mistiryWifi> MikeSpears: AND WHY IS THAT MY/THEIR EMPLOYERS PROBLEM?
[05:18:11] <jay-rosWIFI> this is a funny discussion
[05:18:14] <mistiryWifi> if you're hiring a welder, dont hire someone that can't weld
[05:18:16] <jay-rosWIFI> I don't know anyone who can't use a mouse
[05:18:33] <Riviera> MikeSpears: well
[05:18:36] <MikeSpears> I never said it was. I said as tech people we should be doing more to keep real tech in schools
[05:18:38] <Riviera> MikeSpears: you did not make a point, you stated a fact
[05:18:40] <MikeSpears> not these fucking iPads
[05:18:42] <MikeSpears> :)
[05:18:47] <MikeSpears> lobby the districts
[05:18:47] <Riviera> MikeSpears: a "point" is an interpretation of a fact
[05:19:13] <Riviera> MikeSpears: i indeed fail to see how that is so different to what i was saying of mac vs. windows
[05:19:17] <MikeSpears> we should be ensuring that future generations have what they need
[05:19:23] <Riviera> MikeSpears: it's simply unknown environments
[05:19:40] <Riviera> MikeSpears: iPads can be used with mice as well :-p
[05:19:46] <MikeSpears> I'
[05:19:49] <MikeSpears> I'm aware
[05:19:52] <Riviera> hehe
[05:20:02] <Riviera> yeah just teasing you
[05:21:06] <Riviera> mistiryWifi: i'm relatively certain that welders do get introductions at new workplaces
[05:21:18] <Riviera> mistiryWifi: about their environment, and the equipment the shop uses,
[05:21:34] <Riviera> mistiryWifi: also, i'm a bit less, but still confident, that computers are more complex than welding equipment
[05:21:39] <Riviera> mistiryWifi: so, these things are different
[05:21:43] <mistiryWifi> missing the point
[05:21:48] <Riviera> mistiryWifi: no
[05:21:50] <mistiryWifi> ok
[05:21:54] <Riviera> mistiryWifi: i am offering you my interpretation,
[05:22:02] <mistiryWifi> ok
[05:22:06] <Riviera> mistiryWifi: so that you are able to point out *exactly* where i am missing the point.
[05:22:15] <mistiryWifi> no im done with this convo lol
[05:22:21] <mistiryWifi> its about time for games
[05:22:24] <JollyRgrs> MikeSpears: you know how long i went using a computer before i used a mouse?
[05:22:36] <JollyRgrs> also, how often i don't use a mouse now with my current computer?
[05:22:41] <Riviera> mistiryWifi: so either use this chance or don't annoy me with that general "missing the point" shit, that's just childish.
[05:22:48] <mistiryWifi> ok
[05:22:49] <JollyRgrs> that's one reason why i love IRC, I don't have to use a mouse at all
[05:23:08] <MikeSpears> JollyRgrs: there's a difference :) you know this shit. I'm trying to say that schools aren't even teaching basic usage :)
[05:23:57] <JollyRgrs> i mean, idk... who's job is it to teach "mouse skills"?
[05:24:04] <mistiryWifi> apparently IT
[05:24:11] <JollyRgrs> lol
[05:24:16] <MikeSpears> I mean, ideally the schools would be teaching how to use a standard windows PC
[05:24:22] <MikeSpears> but they're not
[05:24:38] <JollyRgrs> they taught me how to move the cursor on the screen using the keyboard in Turtle
[05:24:43] <xe0n> logo!
[05:24:47] <Riviera> hehe
[05:24:54] <JollyRgrs> but i mean... i already learned computers from my grandpa, so...
[05:24:55] <MikeSpears> 20 years ago, schools had better tech training than they do now.
[05:25:02] <MikeSpears> sad but true
[05:25:02] <Riviera> yeah MikeSpears
[05:25:06] <Riviera> because the world was easier then
[05:25:07] <JollyRgrs> that's b/c tech was this new stuff that not everyone had at home
[05:25:08] <MikeSpears> now its all about iPads and chromebooks
[05:25:12] <Riviera> no tablets, ipads, etc.
[05:25:12] <JollyRgrs> now they assume everyone has computers at home
[05:25:28] <MikeSpears> and there's the biggest problem :)
[05:25:29] <xe0n> nothing wrong with ipads and chromebooks, as long as they're getting the task at hand done, then sweet...
[05:25:40] <mistiryWifi> it is infinitely easier to learn these things today than it was 20 years ago
[05:25:40] <JollyRgrs> a mouse is pretty intuitive
[05:25:40] <MikeSpears> xe0n: businesses don't use those.
[05:25:48] <xe0n> businesses dont use ipads?!
[05:25:53] <Riviera> JollyRgrs: double
[05:25:54] <Riviera> JollyRgrs: click
[05:25:55] <Riviera> :)
[05:25:55] <MikeSpears> schools should be teaching how to use a Windows PC
[05:26:02] <JollyRgrs> even if you've never used one in your life, if you can't pick it up and learn it in like... 1-2 minutes... you prob. shouldn't be using one for a job
[05:26:07] <mistiryWifi> MikeSpears: why just windows?
[05:26:12] <MikeSpears> xe0n:  they do, but windows PCs are more widely used than iPads in business
[05:26:17] <MikeSpears> standard business enviroment
[05:26:25] <JollyRgrs> Riviera: that's an OS thing, not a mouse thing... some OS only need 1 click, and even in an OS, sometimes it "depends"
[05:26:28] <MikeSpears> ideally I'd love to see linux and mac in schools also
[05:26:37] <JollyRgrs> i gotta poop, y'all have fun
[05:26:39] <MikeSpears> but one can only ask for so much
[05:26:42] <Jaelae> most people won't need to ever use a linux machine in life
[05:26:44] <mistiryWifi> JollyRgrs: have fun!
[05:26:50] <JollyRgrs> will do!
[05:26:52] <MikeSpears> Jaelae: exactly
[05:26:53] <Riviera> JollyRgrs: so what now, intuitive or not
[05:26:55] <Jaelae> but yea windows and mac os with productivity apps should be used versus anything ipad based
[05:27:00] <JollyRgrs> Jaelae: yet they use android all the time :P huehuehue
[05:27:03] <Jaelae> chrome books maybe i guess?
[05:27:04] <MikeSpears> hence why I say standard windows machine.
[05:27:06] *** Quits: BUSY (~BUSY@user/busy) (Remote host closed the connection)
[05:27:21] <mistiryWifi> theres lots of things schools dont teach that they should
[05:27:25] <Jaelae> i mean now office 365 has web apps i guess you can do that on a chrome book. but thats a problem right now
[05:27:26] <MikeSpears> yep
[05:27:31] <JollyRgrs> android proves it isn't that linux is hard to use, you just need a nice interface for it and a good support of apps for the app store
[05:27:37] <Jaelae> people say kids are tech savvy because of technology but they may not understand how things work
[05:27:45] <MikeSpears> yep
[05:27:46] <JollyRgrs> Jaelae: that's the same of all generations
[05:27:58] <Jaelae> JollyRgrs:  exactly but the misconception is its chanign
[05:27:59] <JollyRgrs> you don't have to understand how a car works to drive one
[05:27:59] <Jaelae> changing
[05:28:00] <Jaelae> when it isnt
[05:28:04] <mistiryWifi> And thats fine. The whole discussion was if that should then fall on a company's IT department to be expected to teach those things
[05:28:12] <JollyRgrs> nope!
[05:28:21] <mistiryWifi> I agree.
[05:28:28] <JollyRgrs> even entry lvl jobs are like "can you use a computer? yes/no"
[05:28:33] <JollyRgrs> and those who lied? time to get fired
[05:28:51] <mistiryWifi> The computer is the main tool for many many jobs these days. Basic understanding of how to use it is expected.
[05:28:56] <Jaelae> i think if you consider high school curriculum, what is useful with computers/office apps are not specifically taught. though you will use that more than geometry 
[05:28:57] <mistiryWifi> That's all.
[05:29:31] <JollyRgrs> if you got hired as a delivery boy for pizza hut, would you expect the hut to teach someone how to drive?
[05:29:36] <mistiryWifi> Think about this - How different is IT today vs. how it was when YOU were in HS? You think it won't be drastically different for current HS kids in 10-20 years, too?
[05:29:36] <Jaelae> my bank just offered me a $15,000 0% apr credit card with 0% balance transfer.. the fuck
[05:29:37] <MikeSpears> JollyRgrs: no.
[05:29:42] <JollyRgrs> i rest my case
[05:29:56] <mistiryWifi> JollyRgrs: I made similar points earlier.
[05:29:59] <Jaelae> mistiryWifi:  i took programming in high school and the teacher wrote the entire code on the white board for us to then type into  the computer
[05:30:03] <Jaelae> i learned how to type faster 
[05:30:08] <MikeSpears> I'd expect them to teach them how to use the app needed to deliver pizzas :)
[05:30:15] <MikeSpears> considering they require a smartphone now
[05:30:17] <mistiryWifi> Jaelae: My HS had COBOL and PASCAL classes
[05:30:19] <JollyRgrs> Jaelae: yeah, my class in vb6 was just copying the code in the book
[05:30:28] <JollyRgrs> me and buddy next to me played contra on nesticle the entire class
[05:30:35] <Jaelae> if you get a job in porn they do teach you how to f---
[05:30:46] <mistiryWifi> nesticle++
[05:30:52] <MikeSpears> Jaelae: amatuer or pro?
[05:31:09] <Jaelae> i had a bully in my programming class so i changed his start up sound to talk shit to him
[05:31:09] <mistiryWifi> Jaelae: tbf, they actually teach you how to fuck _on camera_. totally different.
[05:31:16] <JollyRgrs> job = paid = [rop
[05:31:16] <MikeSpears> because I actually know someone who used to do professional porn, and they do lol
[05:31:17] <JollyRgrs> pro
[05:31:38] <MikeSpears> there's ametuer porn that pays... I mean onlyfans is a thing
[05:31:52] <JollyRgrs> is it really amatuer if they are getting paid?
[05:32:06] <JollyRgrs> isn't that... nearly the definition of a professional?
[05:32:08] <MikeSpears> idk
[05:32:12] <MikeSpears> maybe
[05:32:20] <mistiryWifi> it just means "independent" basically. or "not produced by a studio"
[05:32:21] *** Joins: BUSY (~BUSY@user/busy)
[05:32:26] <MikeSpears> I think professional porn implies a union iirc
[05:32:34] <MikeSpears> and yea studio based
[05:32:49] <Jaelae> hows the job there MikeSpears  
[05:32:52] <mistiryWifi> in general, "professional" means you get paid to do it
[05:33:05] <mistiryWifi> i can see there being slightly different meanings applied to porn
[05:33:09] <MikeSpears> Jaelae: huh I don't do anything involving porn. Almost worked for pornhub as a sysadmin tho
[05:33:10] <MikeSpears> lol
[05:33:18] <Jaelae> i know man
[05:33:21] <Jaelae> just asking how work work is
[05:33:26] <MikeSpears> ah good as always
[05:33:43] <Jaelae> i got people pissed that some load balancers aren't balanacing the load
[05:33:47] <Jaelae> so i prove it is indeed, balancing the load
[05:33:48] <MikeSpears> had today off as I worked from 9pm-3am handling a software upgrade
[05:33:53] <Jaelae> but they dunno what to do with this information
[05:34:11] <Jaelae> i think someone done goofed are accessing some servers directly

[07:46:18] <yuken> Just realise that if you want any privacy in what you're saying, say it in fucking person.
[07:46:23] <yuken> Or at least via email + PGP.
[07:46:26] <sd> 12<C​ardinal> I'm not saying otherwise GIbby
[07:46:31] <DrGibbysWifi> right
[07:46:32] <sd> 12<C​ardinal> Where did I say anything about Privacy
[07:46:37] <DrGibbysWifi> you didn't
[07:46:51] <DrGibbysWifi> but understand *I* want to control my data to an extent
[07:47:06] <sd> 12<C​ardinal> Then why did you say if I think otherwise, I know that free corporate services use me as a product, I do not care about what I'm saying here as far as privacy is concerned
[07:47:13] <DrGibbysWifi> ok
[07:47:15] <sd> 12<C​ardinal> Sensitive conversations go elsewhere
[07:47:21] <DrGibbysWifi> ok
[07:47:40] <yuken> I have these 4 SLA batteries that I'm not using, that are 100% charged. wtf do I do with them before I put them in storage?
[07:47:47] <JollyRgrs> K.O.
[07:47:51] <yuken> discharge?
[07:48:17] <JollyRgrs> stick your tongue on both connectors to gauge if you need to discharge or not
[07:48:26] <sd> 12<C​ardinal> And there is the idea of compartmentalization between your identities online from a data collection standpoint
[07:48:26] <yuken> lol
[07:48:34] <DrGibbysWifi> ok
[07:51:09] <yuken> DrGibbysWifi, what do you do for work?
[07:51:22] <DrGibbysWifi> I hack shit, yuken 
[07:52:31] <yuken> Awesome.
[07:52:40] <koollman> yuken: store fully charged, preferably at 'room temp' or lower, top up charge from time to time (like every 6 months)
[07:52:50] <yuken> We talking trees with a machete, or white-hat hacking/pentesting?
[07:53:06] <DrGibbysWifi> @Cardinal, my point is: you have a platform where people can click a link and be a dumbass, post really stupid shit, mods are typically fucking morons, and because discord is locked into a particular way of communicating, it only gets worse. Couple that with someone scraping the data and selling it someone else, as a whole the platform isn't good.  
[07:53:06] <yuken> thank you koollman, I'm too unsober to get an answer myself r/n.
[07:53:11] <yuken> :)

[08:00:01] <JollyRgrs> DrGibbysWifi doesn't like anything i recommend
[08:00:26] <JollyRgrs> recommended a tv show to him a few years ago... still hasn't even touched it. send him music and he's like "yeah, nah". he just likes whatever i don't send him :P
[08:00:33] <yuken> haha
[08:00:48] <JollyRgrs> ooh, this should be a good one, DrGibbysWifi 
[08:01:06] <yuken> which one?
[08:01:09] <DrGibbysWifi> yuken: I appreciate you as a person, my dude. Love is reserved for very specific people/things
[08:01:10] <JollyRgrs> the live stream
[08:01:21] <DrGibbysWifi> JollyRgrs: I'
[08:01:24] <yuken> DrGibbysWifi, I get it. Some people don't like throwing that word around, because it has much more significance to them
[08:01:27] <yuken> hence why I wills top using it with you :)
[08:01:39] <DrGibbysWifi> JollyRgrs: I'm listening to yukens thing, should I stop? 
[08:01:39] <JollyRgrs> DrGibbysWifi: he can't help it... he prob grew up on barney, so he was taught to love everyone and everyone should love him
[08:01:48] <yuken> I don't think the word itself has much significance but if you do, I won't use it with you
[08:01:52] <JollyRgrs> DrGibbysWifi: he's playing papercut
[08:01:55] <yuken> same way I'll use whatever pronoun you want even if I think you're stupid
[08:02:03] <DrGibbysWifi> oh.. meh
[08:02:09] <yuken> so long as it doesn't negatively impact me idgaf
[08:02:15] <JollyRgrs> see? i recommend... he doesn't like :P
[08:02:16] <yuken> so thanks for telling me DrGibbysWifi :)
[08:02:42] <DrGibbysWifi> yuken: I did the song tho
[08:03:01] <JollyRgrs> DrGibbysWifi: he's still doing a bang-up job on the kit tho
[08:03:11] <DrGibbysWifi> he always does :D
[08:03:23] <yuken> I've been vibing out really hard on a few songs on repeat DrGibbysWifi, that's one of them. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV97pFpp_M4
[08:03:30] <yuken> These really nice... harmonious songs.
[08:04:14] <DrGibbysWifi> JollyRgrs: I asked him to pick one of 5 very technical songs and he picked the most difficult one and played it to perfection 
[08:04:24] <DrGibbysWifi> dudes a drummers drummer
[08:04:25] <JollyRgrs> nice
[08:04:26] <DrGibbysWifi> I love it
[08:04:59] <DrGibbysWifi> yuken: I'll listen to that after the last one you linked
[08:05:05] <JollyRgrs> srsly contemplating paying someone to write a technical document for me
[08:05:18] <DrGibbysWifi> heh
[08:05:21] <yuken> DrGibbysWifi, when I link people stuff, no hard feelings if you just don't want to. I know that's a given, since this is... IRC/chat room/whatever
[08:05:28] <yuken> but I don't like making people feel bad for not wanting to listen to stuff I send.
[08:05:34] <yuken> cuz I know some people are like that.

[08:30:01] <yuken> hmm.
[08:30:21] <yuken> If I wanna carry a camping/hiking/emergency kit on my bicycle, a duffelbag... what kind of "general medications" should I take? I'm thinking just
[08:30:25] <yuken> ibuprofen, tylenol, and immodium.
[08:30:31] <yuken> Painkillers and anti-shit-yourself.
[08:30:40] <DrGibbysWifi> err
[08:30:44] <xe0n> lol wtf
[08:30:57] <yuken> er, imodium, not immodium
[08:31:01] <xe0n> wear a fanny pack
[08:31:22] <DrGibbysWifi> you need bandages, sutures, etc
[08:31:22] <jay-rosWIFI> hell no, gotta go with the fila cross body

[08:31:50] <DrGibbysWifi> Yeah, so, pain killers are the last thing
[08:31:51] <yuken> I'm trying to just get a basic kit set up. Bandages, disinfectants, flare, whistle, some basic meds, whatever.
[08:31:52] <DrGibbysWifi> heh'
[08:31:54] <yuken> Probably a satelite phone.
[08:32:02] <xe0n> for what? going to work?

[08:32:05] <yuken> I've got knife sharpener, set of bike tools...
[08:32:16] * DrGibbysWifi rubs his temples
[08:32:18] <yuken> xe0n, I am going to be going many, many miles on this bike and probably hunting with it too.
[08:32:33] <yuken> Attaching a hitch to it for a trailer.
[08:32:36] <jay-rosWIFI> you're gonna hunt with a bike?
[08:32:41] <yuken> lol
[08:32:44] <jay-rosWIFI> might want to use a bow, or a trap or something
[08:33:17] <jay-rosWIFI> "Come here you stupud bear"
[08:33:32] <yuken> I got a really nice, lightweight but heavy-duty chain removal tool the other day too. It's always nice to splurge a bit on good tools.
[08:33:32] <jay-rosWIFI> yuken swings his BMX for 1d4 + 1 damage
[08:33:38] <yuken> So much easier than mallet & screwdriver to line it up.
[08:33:54] <yuken> Less strain on everything too.
[08:34:43] <yuken> jay-rosWIFI, it's a bright orange Trek Verve that I threw a motor on, on the back. https://i.imgur.com/iz2nCN5.jpg
[08:34:53] <yuken> I'm basically trying to keep a change of clothes and some basic emergency shit on it.
[08:35:09] <jay-rosWIFI> you don't have a basket and rear rack?
[08:35:11] <yuken> gonna install a rack at the back, as well as add a hitch.
[08:35:14] <yuken> nah, DIYing that.
[08:35:19] <yuken> 3D printers baby.
[08:35:42] <yuken> ignore the wheel/tire there, that was just mockup after installing the wheel for the first time.

[08:36:13] <jay-rosWIFI> yeah, I wouldn't bring a 3d printer on a camping trip

[09:30:39] <yuken> xe0n, legitimately considering it.
[09:30:50] <yuken> It isn't that big of a pay decrease overall, it would let me write my personal projects at the same time

[09:41:06] <yuken> honestly though xe0n, if I could make like
[09:41:11] <JollyRgrs> its not easy finding a WFH job... but very hard to find WFH without much/any experience
[09:41:16] <yuken> $25-30/hr delivering food, I would do it.
[09:41:19] <JollyRgrs> unless you want to be like an online chat support agent
[09:41:20] <CableNinja> sigh... I'm not even gonna be able to prototype my fuckin hardware project for at least a year
[09:41:20] <yuken> forever.
[09:41:28] <JollyRgrs> yuken: for that rate, sure
[09:41:39] <JollyRgrs> but there's a reason why more "simple" jobs don't get paid that much
[09:41:42] <CableNinja> shortest part lead time: 28 weeks. longest part lead time: 53 weeks
[09:41:42] <yuken> I know.

[09:42:50] <kerat58> what is that project supposed to do BTW?

[09:44:49] <xe0n> :P
[09:44:58] <kerat58> CableNinja:  So you plug the USB devices into the switch, leave them connected at all times, but then you can 'hotplug' through network control?
[09:44:59] * CableNinja stomps xe0n's dorritos
[09:45:05] <CableNinja> kerat58, yep
[09:45:10] <kerat58> cool
[09:45:59] <JollyRgrs> MikeSpears: good IT jobs for people with zero experience?

[09:47:08] <yuken> MikeSpears, I'd take a serious pay cut at this point to do WFH.

[09:48:15] <MikeSpears> https://remoteok.com/
[09:48:24] <MikeSpears> yuken: do you have linkedin?
[09:48:31] <yuken> I'm still at a "junior" level, MikeSpears. Talking about logical/pure code, I'd say I'm above averaeg (definitely not a super-duper pro or anything)
[09:48:38] <MikeSpears> I get that
[09:48:39] <JollyRgrs> yeah, programming jobs shouldn't be too hard
[09:48:41] <yuken> but actually working within business deadlines, and in pro environments
[09:48:43] <yuken> still a junior
[09:48:47] <MikeSpears> you should still be able to find plenty of stuff
[09:48:47] <JollyRgrs> how much experience (time) do you have doing this?
[09:48:59] <yuken> JollyRgrs, working professionally for anything outside of dumb labor? <1yr.
[09:49:04] <yuken> Programming at a competent level? 4-5~
[09:49:08] <MikeSpears> honestly you should be fine
[09:49:21] <MikeSpears> do you have linkedin?
[09:49:24] <yuken> no.
[09:49:29] <MikeSpears> there's your first iss
[09:49:31] <MikeSpears> issue*
[09:49:34] <yuken> ugh.
[09:49:35] <MikeSpears> get linkedin
[09:49:54] <yuken> i share my dad's name, MikeSpears 
[09:49:56] <JollyRgrs> ^^
[09:49:57] <yuken> which makes it even worse
[09:49:58] <yuken> but also ew, linkedin.
[09:50:20] <JollyRgrs> get linkedin, formulate a good resume. don't lie, but you can get creative in describing duties for certain things to make stuff look better
[09:50:24] <MikeSpears> its practically a requirement
[09:50:28] <JollyRgrs> and most of all, make sure to toss in those SEO words
[09:50:33] <JollyRgrs> recruiters will hit you up non-stop
[09:50:52] <MikeSpears> https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaelkspears/
[09:50:56] <MikeSpears> there's mine
[09:50:59] <JollyRgrs> also... many times a job is not "posted"... it is only given to recruiting firms to fill
[09:51:12] <MikeSpears> get some ideas on how to build your profile by looking at mine
[09:51:32] <JollyRgrs> MikeSpears: how recent is that pic?
[09:51:39] <MikeSpears> 2-3 years old
[09:51:43] <JollyRgrs> you lopped it off?
[09:51:57] <yuken> MikeSpears, I will look at it once I'm sober, thanks. My problem right now is - I genuinely believe I have ability, and a natural talent here. But I just have...
[09:51:59] <MikeSpears> I normally keep my hair short lol
[09:52:02] <JollyRgrs> i thought i remembered you with longer hair
[09:52:03] <JollyRgrs> hmm
[09:52:04] <yuken> no discipline, and most likely ADHD.
[09:52:10] <JollyRgrs> i'm getting old
[09:52:12] <MikeSpears> yuken: there's ways to fix that
[09:52:21] <MikeSpears> trello boards
[09:52:23] <MikeSpears> todo lists
[09:52:24] <JollyRgrs> IANAnElephant
[09:52:27] <MikeSpears> notes
[09:52:45] <yuken> MikeSpears, I'm going to a specialist soon, hopefully. Either therapy, drugs, or both.
[09:52:55] <MikeSpears> ADHD meds are great if you actually have ADHD
[09:53:06] <JollyRgrs> yuken: good thing, as a Jr, you aren't really working on large picture projects... you just are given a task and asked to do it, right?
[09:53:10] <yuken> I'm REALLY not into stimulants. I ain't touching any stimulants, MikeSpears.
[09:53:17] <yuken> If there's a non-stimulant that can help, like modafinil, maybe.
[09:53:36] <yuken> JollyRgrs, basically, yeah.
[09:53:37] <MikeSpears> sometimes it's the best option. Don't totally kill that idea
[09:53:44] <MikeSpears> I needed adderall for awhile
[09:53:55] <yuken> MikeSpears, I will not touch that shit. Seriously.
[09:54:05] <MikeSpears> I got myself off it years ago, but it does help quite a bit
[09:54:32] <yuken> There are very few chemicals like that that I'd ever try to regularly ingest.
[09:54:35] <MikeSpears> yuken: obviously therapy/coping systems is ideal, but sometimes you gotta go that direction
[09:54:42] <yuken> Caffeine, nicotine, modafinil, and the like.
[09:54:47] <yuken> Amphetamines? Hell no.
[09:54:48] <MikeSpears> caffeine is great
[09:55:08] <yuken> MikeSpears, I really just want to avoid drugs in general, but especially ones with such harsh side effects.
[09:55:15] <SirSceptalot> morning
[09:55:28] <MikeSpears> yuken: I know folks who have super bad ADHD that the only way they're even remotely able to function is adderall
[09:55:47] <MikeSpears> like I think it's overkill if your ADHD is mild
[09:55:54] <MikeSpears> but if nothing else works
[09:55:57] <yuken> MikeSpears, well no, I understand these meds do exist for a reason.
[09:55:59] <yuken> They have a legit reason.
[09:56:03] <yuken> I don't think mine is bad enough to touch that shit.
[09:56:19] <MikeSpears> there you go. Find a good specialist and they'll steer you right
[09:56:31] <MikeSpears> does your state have medical marijuana?
[09:56:42] <yuken> There are a few drugs I would honestly like to try MikeSpears, but they're not regularly prescribed for ADHD iirc. Like the aforementioned one.
[09:56:46] <yuken> No, and even if it did, I couldn't get it.
[09:57:07] <MikeSpears> you sure? ADHD is one of the allowed uses in most states
[09:57:17] <yuken> I have a CCW and will be getting an FFL.
[09:57:22] <yuken> The feds don't like weed.
[09:57:55] <yuken> Oh wait no, we do have medical marijuana it seems?
[09:58:03] <yuken> but yeah no, not until the federal government legalizes it.
[09:58:18] <MikeSpears> eh fair
[09:58:42] <yuken> MikeSpears, I do want to try nicotine to see if it can help me focus, but I'm afraid of gaining a nicotine addiction.
[09:58:48] <yuken> But I'm also afraid of missing out on it, if it really can help.
[09:58:55] <MikeSpears> nic is no worse than caffeine 
[09:59:02] <yuken> No tobaccoes ofc, nicotine.
[09:59:05] <MikeSpears> yep
[09:59:11] <CableNinja> I'd say its worse
[09:59:22] <MikeSpears> CableNinja: yea not really true
[09:59:25] <CableNinja> caffeine you get your one good fix for the day and you're set
[09:59:27] <yuken> MikeSpears, see, I've heard that before. That nicotine itself is not really that much worse than caffeine.
[09:59:29] <MikeSpears> nic itself is no worse
[09:59:30] <yuken> CableNinja, hahahahahahHAHAHAH
[09:59:32] <yuken> good one.
[09:59:36] <MikeSpears> its the other fucking shit in cigs
[09:59:42] <yuken> 1g of caffeine doesn't affect me, psychoactively, CableNinja.
[09:59:47] <yuken> that's 1g, for me, who weighs like 54kg.
[09:59:51] <MikeSpears> yep
[09:59:59] <yuken> I have straight up down 4 caffeine tablets and a coffee drink, nothing.
[10:00:08] <xe0n> ummm nicotine is highly addictive...
[10:00:09] <MikeSpears> caffeine doesn't have too much of an affect on me either
[10:00:12] <xe0n> i would stay away from it...
[10:00:17] <JollyRgrs> xe0n: beat me to it, i was in a round of RL
[10:00:24] <JollyRgrs> yeah... nicotine way worse than caffeine
[10:00:27] <xe0n> ^
[10:00:29] <yuken> xe0n, that's why I'm staying away from it, yeah.
[10:00:39] <yuken> But I'm genuinely wondering at this point if it would be a net positive to use nicotine.
[10:00:45] <CableNinja> its also far more an expensive habit than caffeine
[10:00:45] <xe0n> no..
[10:00:46] <JollyRgrs> nope
[10:00:53] <CableNinja> no
[10:00:58] <JollyRgrs> that's terrible logic, don't go that road
[10:00:58] <CableNinja> and thats coming from a smoker
[10:01:01] <SirSceptalot> Why would using nicotine be positive?
[10:01:20] <CableNinja> SirSceptalot, "lets solve my mental problems by not going to the doctor and instead trying random drugs"
[10:01:36] <xe0n> pretty much..
[10:01:40] <CableNinja> yuken, I hear jenkem is really good for making you focus
[10:01:44] <CableNinja> you should try that
[10:01:52] <SirSceptalot> wtf is jenkem?
[10:01:57] <xe0n> i hear speed is good for focus
[10:02:02] <xe0n> dunno how good it is for your teeth though
[10:02:05] <xe0n> or jaw line
[10:02:05] <xe0n> LOL
[10:02:13] <CableNinja> depends on how you do it.. lol
[10:02:18] <CableNinja> but lets not go down that talk

[10:19:56] <Kiernian|Work> I have a moderately sized collection of tobacco pipes and I can say with certainty that it's the stuff they put in cigarettes that cause cravings like that. Any time the weather is something other than quite nice outside, I won't go out and smoke and I don't suffer in the slightest for it.
[10:20:11] <Kiernian|Work> I light up too many cigarettes in a day and I definitely start to feel a drive to go smoke more, though.
[10:22:00] <Kiernian|Work> IN a given six month period I'll smoke maybe 10 cigarettes as people offer them to me in smoking areas, and at one point last summer I was going through a pound of pipe tobacco a month, just sitting outdoors with a book or whatever puffing away. 
[10:22:14] <Kiernian|Work> never had a craving off of pipe tobacco. I don't inhale either one, though.
[10:22:19] <yuken> MikeSpears, still setting up LinkedIn...

[10:32:38] <A-KO> sigh
[10:32:45] <A-KO> fucking coworker decided to push SCCM Agents to shit he shouldn't have
[10:32:47] <A-KO> and patched themn
[10:32:49] <A-KO> and it broke a ton of shit
[10:32:56] <A-KO> I literally wrote documentation 2 years ago on not to do this
[10:32:58] <A-KO> and they did it anyway
[10:35:34] <JollyRgrs> but why isn't the documentation sticky noted on the RPC service for those machines?
[10:35:57] <Kiernian|Work> I was in the process of setting something up so that by default, every freshly installed agent went into a collection that did ABSOLUTELY NOTHING when the place I was working at got bought out
[10:35:59] <Kiernian|Work> for just that reason
[10:36:30] <A-KO> I mean
[10:36:36] <A-KO> the simple answer is they need to stop using fucking client push for the agent
[10:36:42] <A-KO> and then this wouldn't be an issue
[10:36:43] <Kiernian|Work> well, yes.
[10:44:39] <yuken> Hmm. Friend needs a chair... and he's like 6'4-6'5
[10:45:26] <Kiernian|Work> at that height he's almost certainly pushing the 220lb limit most office chairs have
[10:46:12] <yuken> nope, Kiernian|Work.
[10:47:01] <Kiernian|Work> beanpole, lol. should be pretty easy, then. Just need an adjustable to handle the probably-slightly-nonstandard leg/knee/thigh ratio.
[10:48:12] <Kiernian|Work> I'm 6'2" but I only have a 30-32" inseam, so most of my height is in my torso. chair shopping is cake for me, but they could easily get too low real quick at a few inches taller
[10:48:16] <Kiernian|Work> knees-to-nose is no fun
[10:48:48] <yuken>  god damn
[10:48:50] <yuken> these chairs are expensive.
[10:48:56] <yuken> $500, sure... $2000?
[10:49:07] <Kiernian|Work> yeah. office chairs suck, price-wise.
[10:49:52] <Kiernian|Work> someone gave office chair manufacturers the idea that you should shop for them like you do for a mattress based on how much time you spend there about 18-20 years ago. Prices skyrocketed.
[10:55:30] <Kiernian|Work> huh. So I'm screwing around with a win11 machine before I nuke it....You can do a lot before setting the thing up. Shift F10 to pull a command prompt and there's a full installation of windows running behind this setup screen.
[10:55:52] <Kiernian|Work> i just uninstalled the included games by launching appwiz.cpl and I haven't even selected a country/region yet.
[10:57:48] <JollyRgrs> amazing how much faster the install goes when it starts the install before you click next
[10:58:06] <JollyRgrs> i've seen a few linux distros kinda do the same thing. let you choose the customization stuff AFTER you start the actual install process
[10:58:11] <JollyRgrs> makes things "seem" faster
[10:58:25] <yuken> oh right bedtime
[10:58:26] <yuken> night night
[10:59:13] <Kiernian|Work> yeah. I'm now attempting to see precisely what I can mess with. Just changed the name on the pre-existing local admin account that it has , so that "must use windows online account" thing is clearly BS.

[12:00:45] <Hunterkll> yea storage issues can be interesting
[12:01:02] <Hunterkll> A-KO: I haven't bothered going through all the drives, but one storage space batch on my server causes systems to BSOD when the VHDs are on it

[12:08:53] <Kiernian|Work> Hunterkill -- couldn't in 10 IIRC, but apparently 11 Home allows it once you get to the OOBE. Still nuking it, it was just idle curiosity. If you kill the "Microsoft account" process that calls WWAHost it auto-restarts itself after nuking explorer, so there's no straightforward way to skip out of it entirely, but it did allow me to hit device manager and disable the NIC to avoid the online portion of setup.

[12:09:46] <Kiernian|Work> and no, you have to hit powershell and remove the appx package

[12:10:11] <Hunterkll> :D
[12:10:17] <Kiernian|Work> I noticed that, too :D
[12:10:30] <Hunterkll> because more has moved into appx/rt based
[12:10:47] <Hunterkll> hell even the UAC dialog is RT based now
[12:11:03] <Hunterkll> which, with 10, and especially 11, is why fucking with anything related to appx packages except individually
[12:11:07] <Hunterkll> can be highly dangerous tot he system
[12:11:12] <Hunterkll> you wouldn't uninstall explorer, would you?
[12:11:13] <Hunterkll> :D
[12:11:25] <Hunterkll> or half the start menu? :D
[12:11:28] <DrZak> lol remember the 2000
[12:11:36] <DrZak> when you had various replacements of explorer
[12:11:44] <Kiernian|Work> nope. and yeah, have to be absolutely certain of what you're doing with appx stuff
[12:11:47] <DrZak> made to look like kindergarten retarded mac os

[12:11:57] <Hunterkll> and sometimes even KDE
[12:12:01] <DrZak> yea, fluxbox
[12:12:05] <DrZak> but there was something else
[12:12:10] <DrZak> hmmm wat was it!!
[12:12:17] <Hunterkll> KDE?
[12:12:22] <Hunterkll> I ran KDE 3 on my windows systems
[12:12:26] <Hunterkll> you can still do that you know
[12:12:29] <Kiernian|Work> i honestly only needed to get far enough to get a cmd prompt up so I could shutdown /r /o /f /t 00 so I could change the BIOS boot order to boot from USB so I can install 10 pro 
[12:12:49] <Hunterkll> why would you downgrade?
[12:12:50] <Hunterkll> yuck
[12:12:57] <Kiernian|Work> but I figured I'd poke for curiosity since I was going to nuke
[12:13:03] <Kiernian|Work> no 11 pro license and I need bitlocker
[12:13:04] <Hunterkll> you'd have to pay me to get rid of the new tech that's in 11 
[12:13:08] <Hunterkll> hm?
[12:13:13] <Hunterkll> so put in your 10 pro key
[12:13:13] <Hunterkll> on 11
[12:13:16] <Hunterkll> to change to pro
[12:13:20] <Kiernian|Work> wait, what?
[12:13:27] <DrZak> yea yea i know
[12:13:31] <Hunterkll> 11's a genuinely free upgrade.....
[12:13:34] <Kiernian|Work> holy crap
[12:13:37] <Hunterkll> (unless you're using volume licensing)
[12:13:38] <DrZak> it was just something so funny to do
[12:13:48] <DrZak> and mostly very annoying, but i ran fluxbox for about 4 years
[12:14:15] <DrZak> its where i still had some interest in mucking about with computers
[12:14:27] <DrZak> then i found out about photography and it all went to shit
[12:14:28] <DrZak> :D
[12:14:30] <Hunterkll> Kiernian|Work: well, if it's an 11 capable system, then 10 will end up updating you to 11 anyway

[12:14:59] <Kiernian|Work> yeah, I'll have to try that first. 
[12:15:04] <DrZak> is the 11 problem with lower performance of AMD fixed yet?
[12:15:25] <Hunterkll> ... that was fixied within the same month, basically
[12:15:27] <Hunterkll> next patch cycle
[12:15:32] <DrZak> ah, good
[12:15:33] <Hunterkll> and that fault mostly lied with AMD's bullshit
[12:15:37] <Hunterkll> yea that's ancient news
[12:16:20] <Hunterkll> Kiernian|Work: it is a retail key, not a volume license key, right?
[12:16:20] <DrZak> i can believe that
[12:16:33] <DrZak> there's some alergy at AMD against coding right fw and drivers
[12:16:34] <Kiernian|Work> It's vlsc, so I might be screwed, but I'm going to try it first just in case
[12:16:44] <Kiernian|Work> should only waste 10 minutes
[12:16:55] <Hunterkll> ah
[12:16:59] <Hunterkll> then you're probably SOL but
[12:17:01] <DrZak> it took 5 or 6 revisions of bios on my x570 motherboard to stop crashing at random
[12:17:03] <Hunterkll> convert it to pro with the GVLK first 
[12:17:06] <Hunterkll> then try the MAK
[12:17:10] *** Joins: nullrend (~nullrend@user/nullrend)
[12:17:47] <Hunterkll> but that, i suspect, won't work
[12:18:01] <Hunterkll> Kiernian|Work: though, is it just because you need bitlocker?
[12:18:08] <Hunterkll> Kiernian|Work: because even home auto-encrypts drives on capable machines now
[12:18:17] <Hunterkll> since 10 at least
[12:19:04] <Kiernian|Work> I *think* it's just because of bitlocker. We're full 365/aad, no hybrid, so I can't think of anything else I'll need that pro provides...depends on what 11 home removes, though.
[12:19:31] <Hunterkll> hm
[12:19:36] <Hunterkll> surprised you don't have 11 in vlsc though
[12:19:42] <Hunterkll> no SA? :P
[12:22:12] <Kiernian|Work> no. my predecessor left a mess on that front. I'm still fighting red tape on that one. it's probably going to have to crash and burn before money becomes available
[12:22:39] <Hunterkll> hell even my home license has SA on it 
[12:22:40] <Hunterkll> :D
[12:23:59] <Kiernian|Work> yup
[12:24:20] <Hunterkll> though, with open license being killed, i'm gonna have to move to open value and figure that out
[12:24:32] <Hunterkll> unless the next windows server dropps in my SA window
[12:24:33] <Hunterkll> lol
[12:24:36] <DrZak> wouldnt it make more sense to just go for m365 ?
[12:24:48] <DrZak> entire package, all in one
[12:25:12] <DrZak> or can you have m365 part of a SA ?
[12:25:33] <DrZak> i am in a great position to NEVER ever touching anything on licensing
[12:25:42] <Hunterkll> hm?
[12:25:42] <Kiernian|Work> haha. nice :)
[12:25:49] <Hunterkll> DrZak: depends on what you're doing
[12:26:13] <DrZak> drink coffee and watching videos mostly
[12:26:17] <DrZak> :]
[12:26:21] <Hunterkll> DrZak: if you're just buying the new version of windows and deploying it, and don't need O365 services
[12:26:26] <Hunterkll> then why the FUCK woudl you pay a subscription fee?
[12:26:30] <DrZak> ah well of course
[12:26:39] <Hunterkll> like, a one time fee of $300 or .....
[12:26:59] <DrZak> Kiernian|Work: have onprem stuff ?
[12:27:14] <DrZak> lol this reminds me of an entertaining meeting i will have in 4 hrs
[12:27:15] <Hunterkll> "Kiernian|Work> I *think* it's just because of bitlocker. We're full 365/aad, no hybrid,"
[12:27:22] <DrZak> cuntomer decided to go modern
[12:27:22] * DoTheNeedful throws punches
[12:27:25] <DrZak> intune only
[12:27:34] <Hunterkll> DrZak: but if you're only using O365 E3, for example, it's still cheaper to buy OS licensing on the side
[12:27:43] <DrZak> turns out its missing half the stuff they were setting with GPOs and SCCM
[12:27:52] <Hunterkll> lulz
[12:27:54] <DrZak> Hunterkll: wow
[12:27:54] <Hunterkll> yeaaaa
[12:27:58] <DrZak> i didnt realize
[12:28:09] <Hunterkll> DrZak: O365 E3 sticker price is $23/user/month
[12:28:15] <Hunterkll> M365 E3 is $36/user/month
[12:28:19] <DrZak> yea, and m3 is like 10e extra
[12:28:21] <Hunterkll> mind you, M365 has a bit more 
[12:28:27] <Hunterkll> than just the windows license
[12:28:33] <Hunterkll> all depends on what you're using
[12:29:02] <Hunterkll> like M365 bundles in a bunch of security stuff etc 
[12:29:07] <DrZak> yea, it has intune in there
[12:29:12] <DrZak> which is what you want with mobiles
[12:29:17] <Hunterkll> but ....
[12:29:18] <DrZak> anyway
[12:29:19] <Hunterkll> if you're using EMS 
[12:29:24] <Hunterkll> which has stuff M365 doesn't
[12:29:26] <Hunterkll> then....

[12:29:39] <DrZak> :D
[12:29:43] <Hunterkll> meh
[12:29:47] <Hunterkll> everyone's so afraid of MS licensing
[12:29:56] <Hunterkll> MS has the simplest licensing of most vendors i've encountered, including red hat :D
[12:30:01] <Hunterkll> and that's pre-IBM red hat
[12:30:04] <DrZak> oh and azure premium 1
[12:30:06] <Hunterkll> post-IBM red hat is actually a bit simpler
[12:30:18] <DrZak> yeaaa, so i have heard horrible stuff about rothat licensing
[12:30:28] <Kiernian|Work> rot hat? ROFL
[12:30:32] <Hunterkll> well, it's not horrible per say 
[12:30:34] <Hunterkll> but
[12:30:39] <Hunterkll> we're paying like $3k/yr per host 
[12:30:45] <Hunterkll> versus just $8k upfront for a windows host 
[12:30:47] <Hunterkll> for unlimited VMs
[12:31:00] <DrZak> ah
[12:31:08] <Hunterkll> that's $3k/yr perpetually
[12:31:09] <Hunterkll> forever
[12:31:18] <Hunterkll> vs MS's divorced support setup 
[12:31:28] <Hunterkll> we've got premier in our EA, sure, but still - even if you didn't
[12:31:40] <Hunterkll> one time cost, then $499/incident for support if needed
[12:31:49] <Hunterkll> and if it's an actual bug on the MS side, they refund you 
[12:32:04] <Hunterkll> and they also have special allowances for security incidents, etc

[13:57:11] <kerat58> binders of diagnostic information :)
[13:57:33] <kerat58> I really wish I was a professional during that era.  It must've been badass to take out a binder and go through an IBM checklist

[13:57:52] <Hunterkll> kerat58: at some point, even those manuals go down to "replace board" :P

[14:45:54] <bomb> kek
[14:46:03] <bomb> excellent French engineering
[14:46:14] <Hunterkll> overall OVH is like, one of the larger datacenter operaters int eh world, by numbers they're still doing better than MS/facebook/amazon :D
[14:47:51] <Hunterkll> i've been an OVH customer since 2010/2011, i've yet to find a better and more reasonable non-colo operator yet 
[14:51:06] <bomb> I wanted to try Kimsufi? once, went with Hetzner last minute
[14:51:12] <bomb> like 2009-10
[14:51:36] <bomb> another European ghetto data center which is bigger than AWS :P
[14:51:48] <Hunterkll> i had a like $3/mo one of those
[14:51:51] <Hunterkll> used it to run my billing system
[14:51:54] <koollman> I doubt hetzner is bigger than aws
[14:52:02] <Hunterkll> hetzner is shiiiit

[14:53:30] <Hunterkll> but no, hetzner's footprint is like, fucking puny
[14:53:35] <Hunterkll> they only have four major datacenters 
[14:53:43] <bomb> you don't like it because it's German?
[14:53:48] <Hunterkll> no lol
[14:53:54] <bomb> if yes, totally understandable
[14:53:59] <Hunterkll> because they're a spam/ddos/hack haven and that's compared to OVH 
[14:54:04] <Hunterkll> which isn't that high a bar 
[14:54:07] <bomb> their web console was half-German when I tried to use
[14:54:17] <Hunterkll> oh i'm reasonably literate in german so that wouldn't be a problem
[14:54:28] <bomb> warum
[14:54:43] <Hunterkll> because reasons
[14:54:53] <Hunterkll> but no, everything from service reliability to features/pricing/functionality
[14:55:01] <Hunterkll> I've got like, 3 /27's, a /24, etc with OVH 
[14:55:02] <Hunterkll> lol
[14:55:15] <Hunterkll> a few leased nodes, all like, 8 core xeon w/128GB ram/RAID-10 SSD/etc 
[14:55:21] <Hunterkll> internal VLANs on OVH network, blah blah blah
[14:55:50] <Hunterkll> but yea
[14:55:55] <Hunterkll> Hetzner has 4 datacenter complexes
[14:55:58] <Hunterkll> OVH has 33 worldwide
[14:56:18] <koollman> features/pricing, it's not the same things, though
[14:56:23] <Hunterkll> Hetzner is 3 in germany/finland, and 1 in USA, OVH is goddamn fucking everywhere from AU to singapore to germany to england to US to canada
[14:56:35] <koollman> hetzner is still the best for me if you want a lot of storage, cheap :)
[14:56:36] <bomb> I just want the cheapest possible server. I don't care if it's French or German TBH
[14:56:53] <Hunterkll> see, that's fair enough
[14:57:04] <Hunterkll> hetzner has some strong stuff there if you can't get the dirt cheap kimsufi or soyoustart offerings 
[14:57:23] <Hunterkll> but if you say, want some IP space, hypervisor flexibility, decent IPMI, instaling your own bare metal OS stuff, etc
[14:57:24] <bomb> soyuzstart?
[14:57:28] <Hunterkll> hetzner ... can do it...
[14:57:33] <Hunterkll> kind of....
[14:57:41] <koollman> Hunterkll: well, different features, sure :)
[14:57:44] <Hunterkll> OVH i pay a one-time fee for an IP block from them and it's free
[14:57:47] <Hunterkll> hetzner monthly fee

[14:59:15] <Hunterkll> koollman: eh, i'd argue otherwise, given that before OVH was charging goddamn like 1eur/ip/mo per block

[14:59:31] <Joe-Developer> 8g
[14:59:36] <Joe-Developer> a lot more value for money
[14:59:43] <bomb> you're right

[15:02:13] <Hunterkll> yea
[15:02:16] <Hunterkll> hetzner has its uses

[15:02:20] <koollman> (the reverse auction from hetzner has some gems from time to time)
[15:02:24] <Hunterkll> if you fit the niche and don't mind their fuckery 
[15:02:39] <Hunterkll> like i said, i have hetzner stuff too
[15:02:51] <Hunterkll> nothing i rely on, but stuff i use for a variety of things
[15:03:01] <Hunterkll> would *never* host mail in their ip space though lol
[15:03:11] <koollman> well, yeah. But that's ... logical :)
[15:04:04] <Hunterkll> hmmmm
[15:04:37] <Hunterkll> i wish the kimsufi or contabo said anything about transit
[15:04:45] <Hunterkll> sure, the contobo says 32TB outbound traffic 
[15:04:50] <Hunterkll> but at what speed?
[15:05:07] <koollman> I use ovh for domains, and even phone systems. I've used them for vcenter stuff too before but it wasn't quite great. And I've used them for work but went through many tech troubles with vrack features to link many servers with some vlan-like stuff (which is on a tiny sample so maybe not significant)
[15:05:23] <Hunterkll> i've used the fuck outta vrack
[15:05:28] <Hunterkll> i still have legacy vrack configs in place
[15:05:28] <Hunterkll> lol
[15:05:49] <koollman> yeah. Well ... I had a ceph cluster depending on vrack, and lets say it was a mess :)
[15:05:52] <Hunterkll> i've got like 90 vlans inside my primary vrack right now 
[15:05:53] <Hunterkll> :D
[15:06:31] <Hunterkll> bomb: one thing i look for with VPS offers, is rated port speed
[15:06:36] *** Quits: GWM (~GWM@user/gwm) (Ping timeout: 245 seconds)
[15:06:51] <Hunterkll> say, OVH proper's 2GB ram VPS is 250mbit speed rated, which you're pretty much going to get, without traffic metering 
[15:06:57] <Hunterkll> (not the kimsufi one)
[15:07:00] <Hunterkll> and it's only $6/mo 
[15:07:10] <Hunterkll> whreas contabo, for example, could have 50 VPSes on a 1gbit nic
[15:07:11] <Hunterkll> lol
[15:07:19] <Hunterkll> because they don't actually tell you shit
[15:07:32] <bomb> Hunterkll I think that's the case
[15:07:37] <Hunterkll> Get 32 TB of outgoing and unlimited inbound data transfer with a connection speed between 200 Mbit/s and 1 Gbit/s.
[15:07:40] <bomb> they sell "guaranteed" port VPSes as VDS
[15:07:40] <Hunterkll> lol
[15:07:42] <Hunterkll> "between"
[15:07:54] <bomb> 32 TB Traffic Unlimited Incoming
[15:08:01] <Hunterkll> sure
[15:08:05] <Hunterkll> OVH proper is straight unmetered
[15:08:06] <bomb> dude that's $1/year shared PHP hosting marketing lol
[15:08:22] <bomb> unlimited bandwidth, unlimited disk, unlimited RAM
[15:08:50] <Hunterkll> bomb: no, that's from the contabo VPS page you linked
[15:08:50] <Hunterkll> lol
[15:09:00] <Hunterkll> the thing i pasted
[15:09:05] <bomb> I know
[15:09:16] <Hunterkll> this is some shady ass lookin shit 
[15:09:19] <Hunterkll> great for personal shit tho
[15:09:30] <bomb> company website
[15:09:41] <Hunterkll> https://us.ovhcloud.com/vps/
[15:09:41] <bomb> 100% static app landing pages
[15:09:51] <Hunterkll> but then, for company website, i wouldn't be managing my own server aynway
[15:09:53] <bomb> > us
[15:09:57] <Hunterkll> unless you have a company minecraft server
[15:09:58] <Hunterkll> lol
[15:10:03] <bomb> my company no biggie
[15:10:06] <Hunterkll> bomb: offerings are the same in any country, but still
[15:10:07] <Hunterkll> lol
[15:10:41] <bomb> €32/month one from Contabo has 250 Mbit/s port
[15:10:46] <bomb> isn't that AWESOME?
[15:10:51] <Hunterkll> that's expensive
[15:10:52] <Hunterkll> lol
[15:11:15] <Hunterkll> cheap as shit hand wavy to "oh, well, if you want a guarantee, you're gonna have to pay up...."
[15:11:18] <bomb> oh WTF is that OVHcloud number correct?
[15:11:28] <Hunterkll> yes
[15:11:29] <bomb> $6, 250 Mbps unmetered
[15:11:40] <bomb> that's pretty good
[15:11:43] <Hunterkll> $23usd/mo for 1gbit unmetered with 4 vCPU 8GB ram 160GB SSD
[15:11:52] <bomb> 2 GB but who gives shit it's a static website
[15:12:05] <Hunterkll> bomb: yea, that's the $3.5/mo kimsufi plan, but with actual OVH guarantees instead of best effort
[15:12:10] <bomb> $23 is above my budget
[15:12:27] *** Quits: Hackerpcs (~user@user/hackerpcs) (Quit: Hackerpcs)
[15:12:30] <bomb> alright, no best effort
[15:12:33] <Hunterkll> actually no, it has double the disk space compared to the kimsufi
[15:12:33] <Hunterkll> lol
[15:12:45] <Hunterkll> 40GB instead of 20
[15:12:57] <bomb> yeah and it's NVMe
[15:13:09] <Hunterkll> contabo's 99 cents more expensive than OVH, but obvoiusly more ram/cpu 
[15:13:12] <bomb> I'm pretty sure Hetzner once sold me external USB flashdisks
[15:13:14] <Hunterkll> but, you get what you pay for and all that 
[15:13:45] <Hunterkll> also, being able to call up OVH's ireland office for support and actually talk to a live person in minutes is nice
[15:13:48] <Hunterkll> who speaks english
[15:13:49] <Hunterkll> :D
[15:14:29] <Hunterkll> bomb: if you do a 12 or 24 month (you pay monthly, not upfront) commitment for the value VPS plan, it drops in price too
[15:14:37] <Hunterkll> $5.52/mo for 12 months
[15:14:44] <Hunterkll> and after the 12 months is up the price doesn't go up 
[15:14:46] *** Joins: Hackerpcs (~user@user/hackerpcs)
[15:15:01] <bomb> monthly is fine
[15:15:04] <Hunterkll> ofc every 12 months i flip hardware anyway to a newer platform and migrate 
[15:15:11] <bomb> I don't have 60 bucks handy
[15:15:14] <Hunterkll> but i'm leasing entire hosts, not VMs on someone else's shit 
[15:15:21] <Hunterkll> bomb: no no, you commit to 12 months, but you pay monthly
[15:15:24] <Hunterkll> so you only pay the $5.52/mo
[15:15:30] <Hunterkll> you just end up owing the rest if you cancel
[15:15:31] <bomb> ooh
[15:15:41] <bomb> dude you really should get a hefty bonus from OVH
[15:16:03] <Hunterkll> bomb: if it was in your budget, i'd be reselling you AWS or Azure services
[15:16:04] <Hunterkll> ;)
[15:16:15] <Hunterkll> sadly, OVH is just what me (and a bunch of ops and shit here ) use for personal shit 
[15:16:36] <Hunterkll> I used to actually run a VPS selling/hosting business off OVH leased hardware 
[15:16:37] <Hunterkll> lol
[15:17:20] <bomb> 250 Mbps unmetered <- how many people I'll share this port with?
[15:17:41] <Hunterkll> bomb: given most of their hardware is 10/40/100 gig 
[15:17:43] <Hunterkll> lol

[15:20:00] <Hunterkll> that's the region i'm in
[15:20:13] <bomb> buuut, 2G ram vs 8G ram
[15:20:47] <Hunterkll> right
[15:20:56] <Hunterkll> it's paying for what you know you'll get vs paying for what you hope you'll get
[15:21:06] <Hunterkll> sure , you'll get the ram most likely (unless host VM pressure ballons your ram down)
[15:21:10] <Hunterkll> but....
[15:21:21] <Hunterkll> is that 50GB NVMe all on a single shared drive between how many? who? what? etc
[15:21:26] <bomb> why can't they give me 250 Mbps DEDICATED bandwidth for $5 ??

[15:42:47] <Hunterkll> Kiernian|Work: also, you'd want to search 'install zoom system wide'
[15:44:19] <interop_madness> Can anyone provide an educated guess for this? Client connects via reverse proxy to webservice with Windows Authentication. This works in all cases, except when client runs on the same machine as webservice. reverse proxy is running on a different machine. this scenario fails, unless I execute klist tickets purge, then it works once (unless I call klist tickets purge every time before starting client)
[15:44:36] <Hunterkll> kerberos double hop
[15:44:47] <Hunterkll> constrained delegation issue 
[15:45:29] <interop_madness> Hunterkll, and this explains that it works reliably if client machine != reverse proxy != server but not if  client machine==server?
[15:45:47] <Hunterkll> interop_madness: is the server hitting the reverse proxy first?
[15:45:54] <Hunterkll> or are you accessing via localhost
[15:46:04] <estranger> hip hop anonymous 
[15:46:28] <interop_madness> the client connects to reverse proxy, which is an IIS site with UrlRewrite that forwards to server
[15:46:48] <Hunterkll> so 'client' is a piece of software
[15:46:52] <Hunterkll> not the 'source' machine
[15:46:56] <interop_madness> yes
[15:47:09] <Hunterkll> hmmmm
[15:47:17] <Hunterkll> okay, running through a shortlist in my head
[15:47:21] <interop_madness> The same piece of software fails when connecting (via reverse proxy) to server, if it runs on the server
[15:47:21] <Hunterkll> authentication set to 'Negotiate' ?
[15:47:47] <interop_madness> Yes, Negotiate
[15:48:02] <estranger> dumb question.. is the time right on the server? 
[15:48:28] <Hunterkll> interop_madness: is any kind of constrained delegation configured in AD at all on the machine objects?
[15:48:31] <interop_madness> Client is HttpClient-based and Server is HttpListener-based (both .NET)
[15:48:55] <Hunterkll> and, are the external clients accessing via internet (without access to DCs/Kerb sessions) or from internally (can establish kerb sesisons, etc)
[15:48:59] <interop_madness> checking re. constrained delegation
[15:49:07] <Hunterkll> it's a tab on properties of the machine objets
[15:49:07] <interop_madness> drift, if at all is <1min
[15:49:08] <Hunterkll> in aduc 
[15:49:16] <estranger> 1min is fine 
[15:49:42] <interop_madness> no constrained delegation configured
[15:49:46] <Hunterkll> by default (and this is configurable) it's 5 minutes 
[15:49:47] <Hunterkll> okay
[15:49:57] <Hunterkll> so clients work without, which probably means NTLM being used, but either way....
[15:50:13] <Hunterkll> 20<Hunterkll>30 and, are the external clients accessing via internet (without access to DCs/Kerb sessions) or from internally (can establish kerb sesisons, etc)
[15:50:24] <interop_madness> all machines in all possible client scenarios are in the same network (intranet)
[15:50:41] <Hunterkll> hmmmm
[15:50:52] <interop_madness> there is nothing special about the network either as far as I can tell
[15:50:59] <estranger> this is weird heh why does it care if it already has a ticket
[15:51:05] <estranger> should just use it
[15:51:08] <Hunterkll> nope
[15:51:14] <Hunterkll> not always the case
[15:51:31] <interop_madness> it seems the ticket is either stale or can't be decrypted or whatever (absolute noob on Kerberos)
[15:51:31] <Hunterkll> but, initial sesison/negotiation might not be configured to properly validate afterwards
[15:51:47] <estranger> depends on the . net app I guess? 
[15:51:51] *** Quits: jay-rosWIFI (~jay-ros@user/jay-ros) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[15:52:06] <interop_madness> Oh. an important additional fact I forgot to mention!:
[15:52:18] <estranger> I'm a newb with .net, krb I'm pretty good with 
[15:52:34] <Hunterkll> question
[15:52:41] <Hunterkll> does the application utilize/rely on SPNs and are they properly set
[15:52:42] <Hunterkll> or no
[15:52:43] <estranger> a ticket wouldn't work once it it was encryption issue
[15:52:45] <interop_madness> The client is .NET code, as mentioned. The ticket problem happens EXCLUSIVELY if the calling application (i.e. the app calling the client code) is one of our MFC apps
[15:53:15] <interop_madness> we have windows services that use the exact same client code, those work (also if client machine=server)
[15:53:22] <estranger> I dunno what mfc even is :D
[15:53:30] <Hunterkll> microsoft foundation class
[15:53:34] <Hunterkll> something you really shoulnd't be using anymore
[15:53:35] <Hunterkll> ;)
[15:53:37] <interop_madness> Microsoft Foundation Classes, C++ WinAPI interface
[15:53:41] <estranger> that's why I dunno haha
[15:53:45] <Hunterkll> should be using WinRT via C++ 
[15:53:48] <Hunterkll> since 2012 
[15:53:49] <Hunterkll> :)
[15:53:58] <interop_madness> that would be great yeah
[15:54:09] <Hunterkll> Win32 is deprecated
[15:54:10] <Hunterkll> :D
[15:54:34] <Hunterkll> interop_madness: on a larp, on both the proxy and app machine
[15:54:35] <interop_madness> I mean, MFC apps do some kind of initialization black magic that might interfere with kerberos
[15:54:40] <Hunterkll> nope
[15:54:45] <Hunterkll> lark, not larp
[15:55:02] <interop_madness> lark?
[15:55:05] <Hunterkll> interop_madness: for testing, in AD, change both machine object's delegation tab to 'trust this comptuer for delegation to any service (kerberos only) 
[15:55:08] <estranger> my . net knowledge w krb extends to how our own driver deals with that crap
[15:55:30] <Hunterkll> interop_madness: lark = joke, fun, amusement, etc
[15:55:53] <estranger> and it's annoying our driver doesn't let you a different principal than your login name
[15:56:25] <interop_madness> Hunterkll, "both machine" == server and proxy?
[15:56:30] <Hunterkll> yes
[15:56:37] <Hunterkll> interop_madness: basically, let's take the gloves off, free kerberos of any restrictions, let the machines do any delegation they want 
[15:56:42] <Hunterkll> and see if that changes anything
[15:58:11] <Hunterkll> interop_madness: https://i.imgur.com/YMLESpG.png
[15:58:13] <Hunterkll> that basically
[15:59:24] <Hunterkll> (let AD replicate, bounce the machines, test again from fresh boot - if possible)
[15:59:52] <interop_madness> Hunterkll, thanks, I'll have to forward this to the powers that be, but we're gonna try this definitely
[16:00:03] <Hunterkll> it's a nuclear button to remove kerberos issues
[16:00:16] <Hunterkll> obviously, that's UNCONSTRAINED DELEGATION 
[16:00:24] <Hunterkll> so you do NOT want to leave it enabled 
[16:01:19] <Hunterkll> interop_madness: if it *does* solve anything, you'll want to find out the service type, then set up something like this - https://i.imgur.com/1QCaJbt.png
[16:01:38] <Hunterkll> that's the proper constrained delegation configuration to allow hyper-v virtual machine / storage migrations between VM hosts 
[16:01:39] <Hunterkll> :)
[16:05:17] <Hunterkll> interop_madness: again, taht's just a giant hammer to eliminate potential kerb issues
[16:05:29] <Hunterkll> if that doesn't help, then you're not looking at kerb double hop issues, and need to look at something else 
[16:05:46] <Hunterkll> potentially the fact that source and destination in the client might end up being the same and conflicting
[16:05:54] <Hunterkll> if it's an in house app i'd have developers up my ass proper
[16:06:41] <estranger> "fix your code" --Hunterkill 2022
[16:07:49] <Hunterkll> nah, for logging
[16:07:53] <Hunterkll> could be a server auth config issue
[16:08:03] <Hunterkll> for exmple, i've had to fix apps by reordering the auth modes in IIS 
[16:08:11] <Hunterkll> but it wasn't the apps fault, just our domain configuration for auth methods
[16:12:18] <estranger> ahhh gotcha, makes sense 
[16:13:13] <Hunterkll> given negotiation auth sequence, and how we enforce/limit sequences, got to force the intermediary to only negotiate one type
[16:14:52] <DrZak> negotiate for higher salary
[16:15:40] <DrZak> eh, one of the ruskie idiots has a half billion yacht
[16:15:53] <DrZak> and all he could come up with for a name is 'Sailing Yacht A'
[16:17:06] <Hunterkll> where the fuck is B?
[16:17:26] <DrZak> it will be unlocked at 300 children burned alive
[16:17:31] <DrZak> he has to wait a bit
[16:19:19] <estranger> oof
[16:19:54] <Hunterkll> in normal operations i'd be shocked that hasn't been unlocked on day one
[16:20:00] <Hunterkll> but this is anything but normal performance
[16:22:00] <riff-IRC> yea
[16:22:56] <DrZak> man, i like that ID.Buzz
[16:23:04] <riff-IRC> got a new client in 1994- complaint: "Generator shuts down with an out-of-fuel error at 25% fuel remaining. Over-riding control system isolates fault to controller."
[16:23:17] <DrZak> :)
[16:23:36] <riff-IRC> Start digging through the controller, and saw a setting for the out-of-fuel trip point
[16:24:04] <estranger> 1994? damn u older than me even
[16:24:17] <Hunterkll> DrZak: russians hackin the shit outta our internets
[16:24:18] <riff-IRC> Damn thing wouldn't let me set it below 25% without purchasing an "extended runtime package", which was just an activation key that unlocked some extra settings

[16:24:33] <DrZak> :)
[16:24:41] <DrZak> ye, it needs more network
[16:25:48] <Hunterkll> id.buzz? DID YOU MEAN .RU?!?!?
[16:26:04] <DrZak> no, the volkswagen
[16:26:17] <riff-IRC> Ended up replacing their cheap-and-nasty control system with one of our control systems
[16:26:33] <DrZak> https://www.netcarshow.com/volkswagen/2023-id_buzz/
[16:26:38] <DrZak> its love
[16:27:19] <DrZak> i imagine you can swap the vw emblem with apple logo
[16:27:21] <DrZak> :DDD
[16:27:32] <riff-IRC> And did I mention that the old control system randomly decided to start the generator despite the generator having been totally locked out in the controller settings?
[16:29:53] <riff-IRC> When it did so, I snipped the wires to the fuel pump and switched off the power to the controller.
[16:33:07] <DrZak> :))))))

[18:03:50] <fritzwastaken> lol
[18:03:54] <misspwn> PattyCakes, yeah, this place even though they have unlimited pto still makes you take a separate full 5 consec days off a year because people don't always use the unlimited pto
[18:04:00] <misspwn> so that's a new one for me
[18:04:06] <Hunterkll> so i have 7.64 hrs PTO and 195.97 hrs GL (general leave) right now
[18:04:17] <misspwn> i guess if you are not stressed out you don't need the unlimited pto 
[18:04:23] <XV8> I have to see how much banked OT I have right now. 
[18:04:31] <fritzwastaken> They say we have unlimited PTO, but we still technically accrue PTO. They just dont care if we use more
[18:04:38] <Hunterkll> i keep taking fridays off
[18:04:39] <fritzwastaken> We accrue to esablish a baseline for payouts
[18:04:41] <Hunterkll> because our GL caps at 200 hours
[18:04:42] <Hunterkll> lol
[18:04:44] <misspwn> that makes sense

[18:04:56] <vinrock> and the company knows why
[18:04:59] <Hunterkll> so I use PTO and holiday all the time
[18:04:59] <vinrock> so its cool
[18:05:03] <Hunterkll> so my GL bank is almost always full

[18:05:18] <fritzwastaken> I dont know what to do with it now
[18:05:22] <Hunterkll> so i basically have 5 weeks of pay above and beyond severance at any time 
[18:05:22] <vinrock> hah
[18:05:22] <Hunterkll> lol
[18:05:46] <Hunterkll> oh yea, 5 year tenure - extra severance too

[18:43:57] <mistiry> and even if you stick with the same brand/type, it can still vary just because of natural variations in the final product
