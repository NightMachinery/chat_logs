[05:00:51] <Tameste> hey, i have 1 user with multiple networks and i would like to join them all, when i connect to znc i just connect to 1, the first one i setup, how can i join them others? in docs i have read this: authenticating with zncuser/zncnetwork:password is what you need but not sure how to do that in mIRC
[05:01:06] <Tameste> or where i should authenticate exactly
[05:02:03] *** Joins: cation (cation@user/cation)
[05:02:12] <Khaytsus> Tameste: zncnetwork...  That's waht you're missing, you _have_ to specify it for every connection.  And is there not a mirc entry in the wiki?
[05:02:31] <Tameste> specify what exactly, sorry
[05:02:33] <Khaytsus> right now you likely have zncuser:password   make it user/network:password
[05:02:37] <Khaytsus> The..........network
[05:02:50] <Khaytsus> Whatever you have called them in znc
[05:03:25] <Khaytsus> If you have four networks in znc, you connect to your znc four times
[05:04:03] <Tameste> there's a mirc section, and if i understand what are you saying, the old way specified here makes sense https://wiki.znc.in/MIRC
[05:04:26] <Tameste> oh new one makes sense too
[05:04:30] <Tameste> i understand
[05:04:52] <Tameste> username/networkname:password password being password from znc not from the network no?
[05:05:08] <Khaytsus> Everything is client->znc
[05:05:11] <Tameste> doesn't make much sense to put the network password since i put it in the setup of the network
[05:05:19] <Tameste> yep znc password then, makes sense haha
[05:05:47] <Tameste> ty
[05:06:14] <Khaytsus> No problem, was it the connect 4 times that was the confusing bit?

[05:06:44] <Tameste> yes
[05:07:02] <Tameste> i thought you connect to znc once and from there you automagically connect to all your networks
[05:07:28] *** Joins: Ayukawa (ayukawa@user/ayukawa)
[05:08:01] <Khaytsus> Gotcha yeah..  I wonder if the wiki could use more examples, I haven't looked at that bit too closely in a bit
[05:08:07] <Khaytsus> But that seems to be the typical confusion
[05:08:39] <Khaytsus> But yeah lets you connect to 1 or 4 or whatever of your networks, whatever you need
[05:11:04] <Tameste> i guess once you are connected to a network, if i turn off mirc, znc will still be connected to the network right?
[05:11:07] <Tameste> i mean that's the purpose of it haha
[05:12:06] <Khaytsus> Yes, as long as znc is on a connection that's online 24/7, it's online 24/7
[05:12:29] <Khaytsus> There are a few dumb clients that part channels on client exit, like Pavaluar or somethign on Mac.  But not too many do that.

[20:38:22] <MetaNova> bro
[20:38:26] <predicament> SORRY
[20:38:28] <predicament> that was an accident
[20:38:34] <predicament> i  emant to take ss
[20:38:36] <predicament> i am so sorry
[20:38:52] <predicament> pasted the wrong thing
[20:38:55] <predicament> wrong window
[20:39:17] <predicament> but that's what i noticed.  so is YOURDOMAIN defined at the top there?  i do not know bash
[20:39:22] <predicament> this is a hook for arch
[20:39:35] <predicament> to autoupdate the znc instead of using certbot.
[20:40:11] <MetaNova> !q
[20:40:17] <predicament> okay
[20:40:22] <predicament> nevermind i guess.
[20:40:24] <predicament> its serious
[20:40:46] <predicament> you see the bottom part?  it's supposed to be /var/lib/znc/.znc/znc.pem
[20:40:48] <predicament> like that
[20:40:56] <predicament> not just /var/lib/znc/
[20:41:01] <predicament> just saying.
[20:41:12] <predicament> whoever does the docs there needs to adjust that
[20:41:27] <MetaNova> I'm so glad I know exactly which wiki page and which lines you're looking at
[20:41:35] <predicament> so am i
[20:41:55] <predicament> so you literally just didnt scroll up there with my screwup p[aste?
[20:42:12] <predicament> or are you serious?  i cant tell if it's sarcasm
[20:42:42] <predicament> well.  whatever i guess.  hope it gets adjusted
[20:42:51] <predicament> because i could just link you to the doc
[20:43:05] <predicament> https://wiki.znc.in/Signed_SSL_certificate#General_advice
[20:43:34] <predicament> automating under letsencrypt.
[20:45:58] <predicament> does that help?
[20:46:12] <MetaNova> okay, so you're saying "/var/lib/znc/znc.pem" at https://wiki.znc.in/Signed_SSL_certificate#Automating_znc.pem_creation as well as https://wiki.znc.in/Signed_SSL_certificate#Caddy should be "/var/lib/znc/.znc/znc.pem"
[20:46:28] <predicament> for the znc yes
[20:46:33] <predicament> arch linux places another .znc in there.
[20:46:47] <predicament> that's the actual root .znc dir
[20:47:01] <MetaNova> that's not a bad proposal, this is supposed to be "general advice" and many wiki pages remind you to adjust your paths as required
[20:47:14] <predicament> yeah okay i was just... saying.
[20:47:20] <predicament> it can be very common to not see it
[20:47:24] <predicament> i didnt see it for 12 hours
[20:47:31] <MetaNova> and it's true virtually all packagers use /var/lib/znc as the home this ~/.znc is /var/lib/znc/.znc
[20:47:36] <MetaNova> so that actually should get updated
[20:47:41] <predicament> yes.
[20:49:34] <predicament> thank you for not flipping out on me
[20:49:44] <predicament> lol.  i've had a few guys not be so happy with me here..
[20:49:46] <MetaNova> predicament: fixed
[20:49:52] <predicament> good!
[20:49:53] <predicament> :)
[20:50:05] <predicament> many will be thankful
[20:50:15] <predicament> thank you.
[20:50:26] <MetaNova> even gave you credit in the diff comment
[20:50:33] <predicament> well thank you.
[20:51:06] <MetaNova> https://wiki.znc.in/index.php?title=Signed_SSL_certificate&type=revision&diff=2954&oldid=2777
[20:51:25] <MetaNova> specific, useful changes are always welcome
[20:51:54] <MetaNova> (vs general "this could be more clear" type suggestions, which are still valid, but far more difficult to slap together and call it done)
[20:52:18] <predicament> fair enough
[20:52:34] <predicament> i did help "write" more docs by asking for more laymens terms
[20:52:38] <predicament> its very helpful now
[20:53:02] <predicament> someone gave me credit, rather.
[20:53:16] <MetaNova> bottom line, it comes down to clarity - how well the information can be presented determines how well it will be absorbed and understood
[20:53:22] <predicament> like i had a suggestion and he siad i was right, not sure who it was, but he clarified a lot for me
[20:53:27] <predicament> okay it must've been you
[20:53:45] <predicament> lol
[20:54:23] <predicament> i just told him everything i had issues with and he was telling me that i caught something pretty serious
[20:54:34] <predicament> as opposed to.. what i just proposed
[20:55:15] *** Quits: volki57_ (~volki57@gateway/tor-sasl/volki57) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[20:56:30] <predicament> he rewrote it with my laymen's terms lmao
[20:56:56] <predicament> it was hilarious actually.  i couldn't believe it, it was suddenly like someone was talking to me through documentation hahaha

[21:39:52] <predicament> MetaNova
[21:40:14] <predicament> does this define "example.com"?
[21:40:17] <predicament> #!/bin/bash
[21:40:17] <predicament> YOURDOMAIN="example.com"
[21:40:35] <predicament> later $YOURDOMAIN is used.  I think i screwed up the config
[21:41:06] <predicament> this is a clarification for me specifically
[21:41:12] <predicament> most linux users understand this but im making sure.
[21:41:35] <predicament> since i don't know bash at ALL.  I'm so sorry if that's a bother
[21:41:51] <predicament> or rather i just don't know it well.
[21:42:16] <MetaNova> since YOURDOMAIN is given a value at the beginning and $YOURDOMAIN is used later in the script, it's fairly obvious they want you to use it
[21:42:23] <predicament> thank you
[21:42:25] <predicament> had to be sure
[21:42:26] <MetaNova> either explicitly or by defining it
[21:42:37] <predicament> thats all for that.
[21:42:43] <predicament> :)
[21:42:46] <MetaNova> the example.com is very common standin for an actual domain
[21:42:54] <predicament> yeah i know lol
[21:43:08] <predicament> ive been very sick, my liver tanked last night
[21:43:16] <predicament> so ... i have not been well, im sorry if i am groggy here
[21:43:21] <MetaNova> I think that's required for setting up certbot
[21:43:28] <predicament> no
[21:43:28] <MetaNova> but I haven't set up certbot in a long time
[21:43:30] <predicament> it's not.
[21:43:34] <predicament> not now anyway
[21:43:36] <MetaNova> specifying your actual domain somewhere is
[21:43:42] <predicament> OH yes.
[21:44:04] <predicament> see how i got mixed up there
[21:44:40] <predicament> so $YOURDOMAIN represents example.com i.e. the dns etc
[21:44:42] <MetaNova> right sometimes guides will use $YOURDOMAIN as "substitute here" where this guide wanted you to actually use "$YOURDOMAIN"
[21:45:02] <predicament> right
[21:45:12] <predicament> okay i just wanted to be sure im sorry if thats annoying lol
[21:45:22] <MetaNova> defining it at the start of the script should alleviate most confusion there but it doesn't hurt to check
[21:45:28] <predicament> im just liek that where im always trying to be sure.
[21:45:30] <MetaNova> no problem
[21:45:56] <predicament> and thank you for not losing it on me because of the accidental paste
[21:48:23] <predicament> technically wouldn't it work anyway?  i.e. instead of $YOURDOMAIN i just put my actual subdomain that im reneweing it for
[21:48:35] <predicament> or would it just give an error
[21:48:47] <predicament> just curious
[21:48:59] <predicament> i put $YOURDOMAIN and defined it correctly now
[21:49:23] <predicament> YOURDOMAIN="how.do.you.sleep"
[21:50:19] <predicament> i think it still woudl work as long as the paths are correct
[21:51:04] <predicament> one of the reasons i had so much trouble with my znc in the early days...

[21:53:03] <predicament> so if I put... ImAnIdiot="example.com" then i'd have to use $ImAnIdiot for the rest
[21:53:46] <predicament> capitalization matters there, hence hwy you guys do it uniform.
[21:54:11] <predicament> but i'd rather put something that makes sense  there so thank you lmao alright i'm done torturing you

[22:13:32] <predicament> MetaNova, quick question about the doc.  it said something different.. there's no exit 0
[22:15:43] <predicament> i apparently am not done torturing.
[22:17:17] <predicament> i think its in the wrong place
[22:17:19] <predicament> ;/
[22:18:20] <predicament> i think i didnt put && exit 0 at the end of the $RENEWED_LINEAGE
[22:18:36] <predicament> it wasnt there when i copy/pasted.

[22:20:09] <predicament> i realized that was not the first line, bash always has those first two in scripts
