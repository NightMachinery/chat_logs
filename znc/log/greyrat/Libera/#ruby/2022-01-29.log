[02:25:06] <IsoLinCHiP> So, after torturing myself about which Queueing backend to use, I finally gave up and went for ActiveJob. Now I can iterate over different backends to see which fits the bill best.
[02:27:20] <IsoLinCHiP> I am rather surpised I havent found any 'framework' that also provides job history features.
[02:30:31] <IsoLinCHiP> I really like the concept that for example Gitlab has with its continuous integration. With each run, metadata and output being stored, all in a coherent web UI. Id love to have something like that for arbitrary scheduled jobs or ETL processes.
[02:31:35] <IsoLinCHiP> I wonder how feasable it would be to rip out that part fro gitlab and make it standalone
