[03:12:52] <mdogg> GuiToris and ksft:  "...I realized 'they' slowed me down..." is what I hear.
[03:13:46] <ksft> mdogg: are you a native speaker?
[03:13:49] <mdogg> Actually, "I realized 'that' they slowed me down.." is what I think he's saying but he kind of skips over the word "that".
[03:13:55] <mdogg> Yes.  I live in California.
[03:14:07] <ksft> oh, okay
[03:14:12] <ksft> yeah, that's what I hear
[03:14:21] <mdogg> I had to listen to it again..
[03:14:22] <ksft> with the (very much reduced) "that"
[03:14:25] <mdogg> Right.
[03:15:39] <mdogg> And I didn't really answer your question, ksft.  There are a lot of non-native English speakers in California, however I am a native speaker.  => 
[03:17:09] <ksft> I understood that to mean "Yes. I speak California English natively."
[03:17:36] <GuiToris> shouldn't it be Californian English, if it were such a thing?
[03:18:06] <anrom> Does that mean you talk like a surfer dude?
[03:18:28] <ksft> I might use "Californian" to refer to people from California
[03:18:44] <ksft> although I think I'd be more likely to say "people from California"
[03:18:51] <GuiToris> I was thinking of 'American English' vs 'America English'
[03:19:02] <ksft> yeah, that reasoning makes sense
[03:19:23] <mdogg> GuiToris: English is probably much more difficult to learn than many other languages, but your link is not an example of why it's difficult.  If the guy in that video made that same statement in court exactly the same way, I would bet that the court reporter would not have captured the word "that".
[03:19:42] <ksft> but I don't think that's quite how those words are used
[03:20:04] <ksft> I would say "the American government" but "the California government"
[03:20:38] <GuiToris> mdogg, fuction words are so reduced that I often miss them
[03:20:48] <mdogg> No no no - it's not just cuz he lives in America.  It's because he's talking causally and he just didn't enunciate that particular word the way he should have that one time. 
[03:21:32] <GuiToris> ksft, Utah government vs Utahn government?
[03:21:42] <GuiToris> I'm not sure it's specific to California
[03:21:55] <mdogg> He actually seems to speak pretty well from (from what little I heard from him on the video).  Lazy people probably wouldn't even use the word "that" in that sentence, even though it should be used.
[03:21:59] <anrom> That would be the Mormon government.
[03:23:17] <ksft> GuiToris: right, maybe "American" is the exception there
[03:23:24] <ksft> mdogg: "should" in what sense?
[03:23:37] <ksft> complementizers are often optional in English, and he sure sounds like a native speaker to me
[03:24:00] <anrom> Interesting, the subtitles for that video say it's "I saw that it slowed me down".
[03:24:15] <GuiToris> anrom, it's simplified
[03:24:23] <ksft> maybe prepared from a script he didn't follow exactly, then?
[03:24:28] <mdogg> ksft: He is from what I can tell.  I agree with you.  A lot of Americans (unfortunately) use the word "like".
[03:24:31] <mdogg> As filler words.
[03:24:42] <ksft> are you just being prescriptivist?
[03:24:46] <anrom> I see, there seem to be a lot more discrepancies.

[03:27:37] <mdogg> No, not at all.  But I don't think it's a good habit to say, "I was talking to John and his boss started like yelling at him.  He got upset and he like started blushing."
[03:27:44] <GuiToris> mdogg, 'pretty well', it's kind of annoying that he overuses "y'know"
[03:27:56] <mdogg> ^
[03:28:14] <ksft> mdogg: you think that way of using language isn't a good habit?
[03:28:19] <ksft> isn't that what prescriptivism is?
[03:29:02] <anrom> You could argue that it leads to people taking you less seriously.
[03:29:06] <ksft> people use "filler words" because they communicate pragmatic and maybe (?) sometimes semantic information
[03:29:13] <mdogg> I'm not trying to get into an argument man.  It gets annoying when somebody uses what I call 'filler words' such as "like" or "ya know" or "
[03:29:18] <mdogg> eh" all the time.
[03:29:58] <ksft> you might prefer that they communicate it some other way, but don't claim you aren't being prescriptivist when you prescribe that it's unfortunate to do it that way
[03:30:04] <mdogg> To me, though, "like" in that context is the most annoying.  And yes, that is just my opinion.
[03:30:12] <anrom> That sounds like, you know, like a you problem.
[03:30:36] <ksft> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discourse_marker
[03:30:51] <GuiToris> hmm, interesting, I thought 'like' is cool and I tried to get used to using it
[03:31:16] <GuiToris> "and I was like..." 
[03:31:51] <ksft> that's very common in informal registers of American English at least
[03:31:52] <mdogg> ^ I find that annoying.  To me it's a bad habit that many kids pick up.  But to ksft's point, that's just my opinion.
[03:31:53] <ksft> I use it a lot
[03:32:27] <ksft> only in speech, though
[03:32:35] <GuiToris> ksft, beside 'I like ice-cream'?
[03:32:38] <ksft> not in informal written registers, like right now
[03:32:49] <mdogg> Like is part of a simile.  If you're not making a comparison then there isn't any reason to use it.
[03:33:18] <ksft> yeah, I might use 'be like' to mean 'said, or thought, roughly' in casual conversations with my friends, for example
[03:33:58] <ksft> mdogg: it's fine if you don't use it, but please don't tell other people they're 'wrong' for not speaking your idiolect
[03:34:51] <mdogg> In the context of speaking it is not grammatically correct to use filler words.  
[03:35:00] <mdogg> This is ##English
[03:35:35] <ksft> in your idiolect, it very well might not be
[03:35:37] <ksft> but it is in mine
[03:35:52] <ksft> this isn't ##English-but-only-mdoggs-idiolect
[03:36:05] <anrom> Surely they still have their own rules, they are just not part of standardised English.
[03:36:27] <mdogg> ^
[03:36:32] <ksft> "standard" English usually means whatever the local prestige variant is
[03:36:45] <ksft> (I assume that's what you mean by "standardised")
[03:36:45] <mdogg> No, there is an English standard.
[03:36:53] <ksft> well that's just incorrect
[03:37:02] <tinwhiskers> There's lots of things that are fine in colloquial speech but wouldn't be OK in formal or written language. like, is, like, just a sign of the times. Get off my lawn.
[03:37:11] <mdogg> ^
[03:37:23] <ksft> if you're claiming there are formalized rules for all of even any person's idiolect, let the linguists know
[03:37:29] <ksft> right, it's called a register
[03:37:39] <ksft> but it's important not to confuse that with the prestige of a variant
[03:38:54] <ksft> AAVE, for example, is very often stigmatized, meaning it's not a prestige variant, but many people might use versions of it in all registers
[03:39:01] <anrom> I meant that I'm with ksft on this. Unless we are supposed to speak only standardised English in this channel.
[03:39:04] <mdogg> ksft: So with your logic, it would be acceptable to tell someone that they can say , "I ain't got no money." is an acceptable way to convey they they don't have any money. 
[03:39:32] <ksft> yes, I believe that's acceptable in several variants
[03:39:38] <mdogg> heh
[03:39:39] <tinwhiskers> it *is* fine for someone to *say* that
[03:39:41] <ksft> including possibly AAVE, but I'm not an expert on that
[03:39:55] <mdogg> The purpose of this channel is different man.
[03:40:18] <ksft> the purpose of this channel is not to propagate exclusively high-prestige English variants and assert their superiority over other ones
[03:40:25] <tinwhiskers> You are allowed to speak colloquially here and of course ask about colloquialisms.
[03:40:30] <ksft> which is usually a thin veil for classism and racism
[03:40:39] <mdogg> wow
[03:41:05] <ksft> what a lot of people don't understand is that sentences like your example don't come from someone not understanding how to speak Engish
[03:41:11] <anrom> That's true though.
[03:41:12] <ksft> English*
[03:41:22] <ksft> they come from someone speaking a different variant of English
[03:41:28] <mdogg> *doesn't
[03:41:30] <ksft> it's just as rule-based as the variant you speak
[03:41:38] <ksft> they're just different rules
[03:41:39] <tinwhiskers> However, we don't tolerate things like "wat r u doing" very well
[03:41:58] <ksft> tinwhiskers: I think that's another interesting conversation
[03:42:10] <tinwhiskers> yeah
[03:42:27] <ksft> a different one, definitely, because that sort of usage doesn't have these distinctive race and class markers
[03:42:47] <ksft> but general linguistic rules do still apply
[03:43:12] <ksft> for example, variant spelling ("wat" in place of "what", for example) can sometimes indicate slight differences in meaning
[03:43:15] *** Quits: orbyt (~textual@172.92.4.78) (Quit: My MacBook has gone to sleep. ZZZzzz…)
[03:43:49] <tinwhiskers> There's an aspect of setting a good example for people learning the language, but depriving people of colloquial speech when they are learning is not really a good thing, imo. There's no need whatsoever to encourage "wat r u doin".
[03:44:10] <mdogg> I agree.
[03:45:06] <ksft> I imagine an argument to be made that if people here usually want to learn English as it's usually spoken in real life, then it makes sense to encourage people to use it approximately the way they speak it
[03:45:07] <mdogg> But I also do not think that someone who is trying to learn the language should adopt a filler word (like 'like') simply because they have heard other people do it in the past.  
[03:45:32] <tinwhiskers> maybe
[03:45:41] *** Quits: hassoon (~hassoon@user/hassoon) (Quit: leaving)
[03:45:44] <ksft> if they don't want to learn the language as it's spoken by native speakers, they're free to say things differently
[03:45:51] <ksft> but it's likely to make communication more difficult
[03:46:06] <tinwhiskers> there's probably something to be said for learning a fair bit of formal English before getting too colloquial.
[03:46:11] <ksft> your approach still makes me think you're trying to improve English in some sense
[03:46:57] <mdogg> "It like could make communication more difficult like."  
[03:47:06] <mdogg> How does that help anybody?
[03:47:09] <ksft> which of course involves judging the quality of different variants
[03:48:18] <ksft> here's something that might illustrate why that's misguided:
[03:48:32] <ksft> did you know that AAVE has a richer tense system than standard American English?
[03:48:34] <ksft> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African-American_Vernacular_English#Grammar
[03:48:49] <tinwhiskers> considering half the native English speakers can't even use "than" instead of "then" correctly, learning off most natives is going to lead to bad habits.
[03:49:18] <tinwhiskers> I'd prefer to eat poison then go the dinner with your parents.
[03:49:21] <mdogg> That's true, tinwhiskers.  Or "sit" vs. "set".
[03:49:25] <ksft> I think it's an interesting empirical fact that orthography is just about entirely independent
[03:49:47] <ksft> standardized orthography has uses, and it isn't learned the way the language itself is learned
[03:49:52] <tinwhiskers> *I'd prefer to eat poison then go to dinner with your parents.
[03:50:37] <ksft> when you write that sentence, you lose the prosodical clues about which word you meant, so you have to follow the convention or risk misleading the reader

[04:09:35] <mdogg> They came into your apartment?  
[04:09:39] <mdogg> Without your knowledge?
[04:10:07] <TechTest> my ex was living there and apparently she had given her father a pair of keys
[04:10:30] <TechTest> so one day he entered the apartment during the night to check if we were sleeping in separate beds
[04:10:51] <mdogg> Oh wow - that's creepy.  He's a dirtbag.
[04:10:58] <TechTest> we weren't, so things went bad lol
[04:11:02] <TechTest> yeah
[04:11:42] <mdogg> I'd change my locks after that for sure.
[04:11:44] <TechTest> when we broke up she gave me back both keys, but who knows maybe the creep would have made other keys
[04:11:52] <mdogg> Yeah - doesn't matter. 
[04:12:04] <mdogg> "Keep the keys."   lol
[04:12:13] <TechTest> mdogg: well, my ex gave him the keys because he asked her 
[04:12:19] <TechTest> so she was to blame
[04:13:02] <TechTest> she had also told him she was a virgin and that we were sleeping in separate beds
[04:14:38] <mdogg> If I give someone a key to my house, I trust them to the point where I give them authority to duplicate the key and give it to someone else, and I assume that there is some kind of need to do that.
[04:15:16] <mdogg> I don't ask them, but if they feel the need to do that then that's just the way it is.  I trust them.
[04:15:33] <TechTest> well, she was living there I couldn't not give her a key
[04:16:06] <TechTest> but anyways she should have set some limits to her father in general

[04:38:57] <mdogg> The only reason to give someone a house key is if you trust them completely.  And if you live with someone you should be able to do that.  I made the mistake of trusting someone a key to my house and later learned that it was a mistake.  That happens.

[07:25:38] <ksft> I wouldn't say that
[07:26:11] <Babar> can condolences only be done on deaths, then?
[07:26:22] <Babar> what are the condolence conditions?
[07:26:57] <twb> "console"
[07:27:51] <Babar> but the intention there is different
[07:35:10] <Sheilong> What could I use to replace the phrase "in order to"? grammarly says it is too wordy
[07:35:51] <Babar> "to"?
[07:35:56] <Babar> depends on the context
[07:36:16] <twb> delete the whole sentence
[07:37:24] <Babar> that would definitely reduce wordiness :D
[07:40:02] *** Parts: itsmemoria (~itsmemori@user/itsmemoria) (WeeChat 3.2)
[07:40:35] <ksft> Sheilong: give the whole sentence and maybe we can make suggestions?
[07:41:20] <Sheilong> "The global analysis aims to gather data from several different cement plants in order to obtain a larger dataset and make predictions with the Transformer model in two steps."
[07:41:43] <twb> That should be about 4 sentences.
[07:45:04] <ksft> what is the dataset larger than?
[07:45:21] <ksft> if it was only gathered from one cement plant?
[07:46:58] <ksft> if that's what you mean, it's probably not worth telling your readers that four is more than one
[07:47:15] <ksft> I'd cut the whole "in order to obtain a larger dataset"
[07:47:18] <twb> I assume there's an earlier sentence that shows "a big dataset is automatically better than a small dataset"
[07:47:37] <twb> (except that is not always true, of course)
[07:49:49] <twb> My read of that original sentence is basically "machine learning DEFINITELY doesn't work on small datasets, and SOMETIMES works on big datasets, so we got as much data we could and shoved it all in there and hoped for the best"
[07:50:03] <Sheilong> Maybe "so as to obtain a larger pool of data" sounds better?
[07:50:24] <twb> So my next question is: did you normalize the data at all?
[07:51:40] <twb> I would also talk to staff physically in the plants, because in my experience they just type "10mm" into the field regardless of whether they measured 7mm or 12mm, because they're busy and the computer is a waste of time anyway
[07:53:39] <twb> admittedly that was a long time ago when man-in-the-loop was still a thing

[08:23:22] <sam113101> because linux
[08:24:38] <pussipupu> How does Linux cause you to paste random things?
[08:24:57] <twb> pussipupu: X11 has 3 clipboards (and another 2 legacy ones)
[08:25:18] <twb> pussipupu: if you use a terminal emulator or a web browser, they often ignore standard conventions about which clipboard to use
[08:25:45] <twb> so for example, copying from the address bar in firefox goes to CLIPBOARD, but copying from the page itself goes to PRIMARY
[08:25:51] <pussipupu> Also lol at the idea that Zuckerberg is inhuman, not just what happens when you give humans huge unaccountable power
[08:25:52] <pussipupu> Sure, that doesn't really answer the question though
[08:26:08] <pussipupu> Gosh the bridge is still super laggy
[08:26:09] <twb> in a terminal, shift+insert pastes from PRIMARY but middle-click pastes from CLIPBOARD
[08:26:29] <twb> pussipupu: yes but you can also just tell by looking at him that his human suit doesn't fit very well
[08:26:48] <twb> pussipupu: it is like Hawking's voice -- they have much better human suits now, but he sticks with the one he started out with
[08:27:28] <pussipupu> Yes yes, very funny and original
[08:27:38] <nalkri> Stephen Hawking the dead physicist?
[08:27:58] <twb> One thing that mitigates shit pasting is to ensure both your terminal and your app support "bracketed paste mode", which lets the app know you're not just typing really fast
[08:28:01] <nalkri> This whole thing seems in pretty poor taste, count me out
[08:28:03] <sam113101> yeah, basically Quentin Tarantino was in a clipboard because I had to look him up on 2G4o8o2g3l4e, and the url was in another clipboard
[08:28:26] <sam113101> I used the wrong one because shit's confusing
[08:30:16] <twb> nalkri: you're probably missing the "in joke" context of https://www.jwz.org/blog
[08:30:38] <nalkri> Fair enough, not an issue I encounter
[08:30:38] * nalkri is pussipupu but less laggy
[08:30:38] <nalkri> twb: No, thanks
[08:32:56] <twb> That's the guy who made Firefox and convinced all the venture capitalists that the red star and "PARTY MEMBER" cards were references to 1950s _capitalist_ artwork they just hadn't heard about
[08:33:08] <twb> Also he really likes _They Live_
[08:33:55] <nalkri> And writing in green ink apparently
[08:34:36] <twb> because terminals are all green-on-black phosphor, right
[08:35:17] <nalkri> But anyway, still pretty poor taste and “some of one of my in-groups has it as an in joke” doesn't really speak to that
[08:35:37] <sam113101> you know how on linux when you select something it gets into a clipboard
[08:35:43] <sam113101> they should delete that behavior
[08:35:54] <twb> nalkri: it's poor taste to suggest someone is inhuman?
[08:35:59] <nalkri> You should use Emacs, then you get a kill ring to play with too
[08:36:03] <nalkri> twb: Can we just not?
[08:36:17] <twb> I'm just trying to understand *why* you think it's poor taste

[10:31:42] <twb> "systray" does not exist on Linux.
[10:32:58] <twb> In the 2000s there ways a systray-like protocol implemented by GNOME1, IceWM, &c.  It no longer exists.  GNOME3 has its own protocol called something like "DesktopNotify".  I *think* KDE implements its own instead of being compatible, mainly because GNOME3's spec assumes the clients are written in a fork of an unmaintained 15-year-old javascript engine.
[10:33:56] <twb> I didn't look too deeply -- just enough to determine that I couldn't stop GNOME3's taskbar displaying the date in middle-endian format, without writing C code

Briefly   I was a geologist examining a site with rock in my hand bringing it closer to my eye to get a good look at it.  At this point I awoke to find me about to crack myself in the eye with my mouse.

[12:32:42] <raccoon_dog> twb: Re: USians. To be clear, I know what that word means, and that, etymologically it has nothing to do with the slur. But at the same time I recognize there are people who bristle at the mere thought of the word, and, honestly, it just isn't worth it to start a linguistics debate whenever the issue comes up with someone who disapproves of its usage.
[12:32:54] <raccoon_dog> So, for that reason, I just avoid it, knowing the actual heritage of the word.

[20:04:10] <acidsys> Hi, hope it fits here, could someone be so kind to help me as to whether `hold` or `holds` is the correct form in this context? a; "Each of those modules hold a dependency on the kernel version." b; "Each of those modules holds a dependency on the kernel version."
[20:04:39] <Babar> "each of these modules" is a singular, so you'd use holds
[20:04:40] <TechTest> "hold" 
[20:04:47] <acidsys> =P
[20:05:07] <Babar> replace it with "This module" to see how what I said makes sense
[20:05:22] <Babar> "This module hold a dependency" is wrong
[20:05:57] <huf> Bayes: well, they've got different vowels
[20:06:17] <huf> and I think "can" gets reduced more often?
[20:06:35] <acidsys> Hmhat makes sense. I wasn't sure whether replacing it with "This module" or "These modules" is more appropriate.
[20:07:53] <Babar> no, I mean, you don't need to, depending on your context. I was just giving an example to show how "holds" would be wrong
[20:07:57] <TechTest> I actually read "this module" o.o
[20:08:04] <Babar> because the subject here was plural
[20:08:14] <Babar> because the subject here was singular
[20:08:31] <acidsys> Oh yes, I was just saying, I wasn't sure which form would be appropriate to replace it with for better understanding
[20:08:32] <Babar> ...and hold would be wrong
[20:08:37] <Babar> I've mixed everything up
[20:08:48] <acidsys> Now I'm confused
[20:08:56] <huf> each makes it singular
[20:08:58] <acidsys> But I appreciate the responses! 
[20:08:59] <Babar> my original statement stands
[20:09:04] <Babar> yes, singular
[20:09:05] <huf> even though it feels weird because you put singular right after the word "modules"
[20:09:08] <huf> but it's each
[20:09:09] <huf> it's special
[20:09:31] <Babar> if you are talking about each module separately, it makes sense to say "each of these modules holds"

[20:10:49] <acidsys> I am correcting some things and the modules sentence was originally written with "holds", but it sounded wrong to me. Upon trying to correct it, I got confused, as other parts seem to be not quite proper English either
[20:14:08] <totenkoph> *Each of those modules hold* is the correct one
[20:14:10] <Babar> I'd say "these"
[20:14:43] <Babar> but also, holds
[20:14:46] <acidsys> "Each of these modules holds" ?
[20:14:48] <Babar> because again, singulr
[20:14:57] <acidsys> I feel like that bites the sound of it
[20:15:00] <Babar> yes, the modules have just been mentioned above
[20:15:21] <Babar> not referring to modules way off somewhere else
[20:15:35] <Babar> ..unless they are
[20:15:52] <totenkoph> yes singular but I have seen the opposite quite a lot on forums..I believe it has to be *holds*

[22:16:47] <blkshp> maybe a herbal tea.
[22:16:58] <TechTest> not eating at all, eating a lot, not eating carbs, eating only carbs, eating a lot of fat..
[22:16:58] <blkshp> No sugar, caffeine
[22:17:07] <TechTest> blkshp: -.-
[22:17:55] <TechTest> my sleeping issue isn't "turn off the blue lights, don't eat, have some chamomile tea and count sheep"
[22:17:55] <blkshp> I don;t know what that's for
[22:18:06] <blkshp> What is it then?
[22:18:40] <TechTest> some drug or some very aggressive 
[22:18:50] <TechTest> I even got a weighted blanket
[22:19:16] <blkshp> I can't count sheep
[22:19:30] <TechTest> count black sheep then
[22:19:37] <TechTest> (ok, sorry)
[22:19:39] <blkshp> I can't
[22:19:56] <blkshp> I can't count anything, I don't see anything
[22:20:09] <blkshp> Images cannot be created in my brain!
[22:20:11] <TechTest> I can, I have reached 10.000 sheep or so
[22:20:45] <TechTest> that was mostly when I was a kid and my dad was putting me in bed like 4-5 times every night
[22:21:07] <TechTest> he insisted I should count sheep
[22:21:26] <blkshp> :(
[22:21:34] <blkshp> I wanna count sheep :'(
[22:21:49] <TechTest> err why?
[22:22:16] <blkshp> Because I can't see the apple.
[22:22:28] <TechTest> apple?
[22:22:30] <blkshp> (it's an aphantasia test) You can google that one
[22:24:08] <TechTest> blkshp: what do you mean? can't you see an apple in your brain?
[22:24:22] <blkshp> nope
[22:24:31] <TechTest> really?
[22:24:34] <blkshp> Really.
[22:24:38] <TechTest> can you see dreams?
[22:25:14] <blkshp> I have no minds eye when conscious. Yes, I can see dreams but once they're gone i remember they happened and the jist of it but not 'se' them again
[22:25:17] <TechTest> according to that apple scale test I'm a 1
[22:26:16] <blkshp> Im the bottom one
[22:26:48] <blkshp> however i have a friend that is highest, can see in colour, manipulate on the fly and I'm a little jealous lol but
[22:27:04] <TechTest> I didn't know people could not imagine things 
[22:27:15] <TechTest> I can see the color, texture, every little detail
[22:27:31] <blkshp> lucky.
[22:27:39] <TechTest> I can see things in my head exactly as they are in real life
[22:27:40] <blkshp> I can imagine, just not visually.
[22:28:01] <TechTest> when did you realise that you can't imagine things?
[22:28:15] <TechTest> I mean see them
[22:28:44] <blkshp> About a year ago. Yuken from ##chat mentioned he couldn't and described the condition. It's very common really.
[22:29:02] <blkshp> they say 2 in 10
[22:29:50] <TechTest> can you see people's faces?
[22:30:16] <blkshp> no
[22:31:25] <TechTest> do you think it's easier for you to concentrate at your work or whatever you are doing?
[22:31:46] <blkshp> I have no basis for comparisson.
[22:31:59] <blkshp> But i guess "day dreaming" isn't a thing lol
[22:32:07] <TechTest> true 
[22:32:18] <TechTest> well, you could be lucky too :)
[22:32:35] <TechTest> a constantly active brain isn't always useful
[22:32:56] <blkshp> mine constantly plays tunes.

[22:33:42] <TechTest> apparently 1 isn't very common either
[22:34:10] <blkshp> Nope
[22:34:23] <TechTest> lol that thing blew my mind I never thought there were people who could not see things in their mind just like they are
[22:36:48] <blkshp> Imagine when i realised
[22:38:11] <TechTest> yeah
[22:38:31] <TechTest> very interesting
[22:39:06] <TechTest> are you into music?
[22:39:21] <blkshp> not really
[22:40:31] <TechTest> so there's just nothing in your mind?
[22:40:49] <blkshp> Oh no, there's always a tune of something
[22:41:01] <TechTest> tune like music tune?

[22:41:17] <blkshp> at the moment, it's the theme to "Dragons den" because it was on the TV a moment ago. It'll be there until i hear something else.
[22:41:35] <pussipupu> Is that still running or was it a repeat?
[22:41:41] <TechTest> that never happened to me
[22:41:44] <blkshp> still running
[22:41:59] <TechTest> apparently there's aphantasia and hyperphantasia 
[22:42:09] <TechTest> so the opposite is definitely a thing too
[22:42:10] <blkshp> whats hyper..?
[22:42:13] <blkshp> oh
[22:42:28] <pussipupu> Gosh, it's an age since I've seen it, didn't realise it was still going
[22:42:34] <TechTest> to be honest there's many times I wish I could not think
[22:43:04] * TechTest considers giving some visual thinking to blkshp 
[22:43:16] <blkshp> There's many times i've wished many things lol
[22:43:33] <TechTest> can you draw?
[22:43:55] <blkshp> My artistic skills are limited
[22:44:00] <blkshp> VERY limited.

[22:44:31] <TechTest> that probably explains why some people can draw and others can't
[22:45:14] <blkshp> Indeed
[22:45:27] <TechTest> it's actually a skill related to how one sees the world and is able to re-visualise it
[22:45:43] <blkshp> The revisualising is a problem
[22:46:03] <TechTest> blkshp: actually you've opened my eyes
[22:46:13] <TechTest> blkshp++
[22:46:14] <tinsoldier> blkshp: +42, -3 = 39. Informative (1) 
[22:47:01] <blkshp> Well I'm glad i could teach you a new word with my pain xD
[22:47:23] <TechTest> it's not about the word
[22:47:34] <blkshp> lol, I get that
[22:47:51] <TechTest> the test is avout how yoh can think of an apple
[22:48:44] <TechTest> I would definitely choose the 1, but honestly I can see the sun shining on the apples surface, I can see drops of water on it
[22:49:15] <TechTest> so 1 isn't even enough detail
[22:49:19] <blkshp> See I can't see the apple but i know an apple, i can describe it in every detail i just can't see it!
[22:50:11] <TechTest> well, think ut the other way
[22:50:34] <blkshp> I can't imagine it! 
[22:50:42] <TechTest> I will think of the apple on the tree, of the apple on the grocery store
[22:51:00] <TechTest> you don't risk falling into that 
[22:52:19] <blkshp> Id rather be able to see the apple
[22:52:44] <TechTest> I guess we all envy what we can't have
[22:52:53] <blkshp> yup
