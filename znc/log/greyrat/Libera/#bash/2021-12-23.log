[00:21:28] <quas[m]> Rohambili: you can use a systemd script of the type 'oneshot', if you want to run the script only once at boot time.
[00:21:48] <quas[m]> and you can create several conditions there, just as start after network.target or stuff like that
[00:22:29] <Rohambili> Nope its when ppp0 connects. but all is fin now
[00:22:32] <quas[m]> oneshot is not for services, only for running a script that changes/triggers something.
[00:22:37] <quas[m]> ok

[00:42:55] <Patsie> anybody got a better idea to get a high(er) precision timer in awk? I'm currently reading /proc/uptime with a getline, that gets me to hundreth of a second. I'd like milisecond if that's possible from somewhere easy (no forking, that takes too much time and slows down the process considerably)
[00:43:24] <lopid> #awk ;)

[00:44:52] <Patsie> I need it continuously updated
[00:46:21] <Patsie> not really usefull to have a high precision timer if it doesn't update ;)

[01:51:47] <jwash> hi guys i have a | delimited file with the 5th column supposed to only have a 0 or a 1

[01:52:20] <jwash> how do i find where these conditions are not true for column 5
[01:53:07] <geirha> awk -F'|' '!$5'
[01:53:09] <jwash> i have been trying awk like this: awk '{ if ($5 == "1996") { print } }'
[01:53:33] <geirha> how did you squeeze 1996 in between 0 and 1?
[01:53:45] <jwash> you don't
[01:54:09] <jwash> there was a trivial error in importation which resulted in 1996 being in the wrong column
[01:54:15] <jwash> i am investigating why
[01:54:34] <emanuele6> so you want to print all the lines that don't have 0 or 1 as column 5?

[06:26:35] <Rohambili> Hi! When i try to run my script for crontab i get this in the log: Shell is /bin/sh but /bin/bash is needed.
[06:26:35] <Rohambili> Run for Ubuntu/Debian 'dpkg-reconfigure dash'
[06:26:35] <Rohambili> or 'chsh-s /bin/bash' to using bash.  i did dpkg-reconfigure dash but the same happens.
[06:27:12] <Rohambili> go to distros channel?
[06:27:41] <Blondie101010> where does the message "Shell is /bin/sh but /bin/bash" come from?
[06:28:13] <Blondie101010> that sounds to me like something written inside the script itself
[06:28:59] <Blondie101010> or a really awkward shell
[06:29:09] <Rohambili> when i run in terminal like this: bash myscript.sh -> logfile its perfectly fine
[06:29:37] <Blondie101010> does it work if you put the right shebang?
[06:29:52] <djph> Blondie101010: incoming "waht's a shebang"
[06:29:59] <Rohambili> yup
[06:30:06] <Rohambili> But i can tell you
[06:30:07] <Blondie101010> look at the first line
[06:31:02] <Blondie101010> #! is what tells the OS what to call to run it
[06:31:53] <Rohambili> bash
[06:32:23] <Rohambili> #!/bin/bash
[06:32:52] <Blondie101010> then there's something inconsistent in what you're saying
[06:33:17] <Blondie101010> but as I said, the message you came with does not come from bash or posix sh
[06:33:18] <djph> could be that 'bash' isn't in /bin
[06:33:34] <djph> ... I think some newer distros have gone off the rails with that ...
[06:33:45] <Blondie101010> also wondering about that, but I doubt it would cause this
[06:33:53] <Blondie101010> sounds more like a fake bash

[13:10:36] <ManDay> so bash has no means of "wait for every child process to finish"? I need this because I start something in a sandbox (chroot with mounts etc.) and I want to shut down the sandbox when the "something" (being firefox) is done

[13:13:07] <grawity> ManDay: I don't think Linux *in general* has that capability (unless you use cgroups, e.g. via systemd-run --user) – a process knows about *its* immediate child processes, but not about any grandchildren
[13:13:11] <Soliton> maybe you can do something with namespaces if you're on linux.
[13:14:02] <grawity> yes, if you do all your mounts within a mount-namespace, you won't *need* to manually tear them all down, they'll just vanish once all processes in the namespace exit

[13:21:35] <bash-libera> Is there some reading I can do to understand the shell concept?
[13:21:53] <grawity> mounting has to be done inside the namespace, it's easier in e.g. C because the same process can call unshare() and mount() and stuff

[13:23:54] <bash-libera> Ok interesting
[13:24:07] <Soliton> running through a shell here means that you can just give it a string of shell code. which is silly if you might not even need a shell. in your case you do but you also want to hand it arbitrary data in the form of those variables. if you can just specify shell code then your only choice is to inject that arbitrary data into the shell code which can have unintended consequences unless you prepare that data
[13:24:14] <Soliton> properly.
[13:26:33] <Soliton> sh -c "cmd $variable_is_expanded_by_caller_into_this_shell_code more code..."  vs  sh -c 'cmd "$data"' sh "$var"
[13:27:29] <Soliton> in the former case it's shell code so any shell syntax in the variable will be handled accordingly while in the latter case it's just data given to cmd as an argument. no matter what is in the variable.
[13:29:55] <Soliton> in your case those variable probably don't contain shell meta characters but there is no reason to risk it.

[21:37:20] <Guest28> Hello I am trying to filter files that contain multiple lines not containing the word "@System". I try to grep for multiple lines, how do I add "and line does not contain "@System"?
[21:37:20] <Guest28> dnf provides pkgconf-m4 | grep 'Repo\+'
[21:37:21] <Guest28> Repo        : @System
[21:37:21] <Guest28> Repo        : a-rhel82-s390x-base
[21:37:22] <Guest28> Repo        : a-rhel84-s390x-base
[21:37:53] <tirnanog> by using awk instead.
[21:38:22] <tirnanog> e.g. awk '/pat1/ && ! /pat2/'
[21:38:30] <Guest28> Basically I want to find files that contain the word System, but also additional lines that start with "Repo' and cotain these other package names
[21:38:48] <emanuele6> why do you want to match Repoooooooo?
[21:39:06] <tirnanog> I'm gonna install from a ... repooooo!

[21:39:38] <Guest28> tirnanog thanks I rephrased my question, I need to search for files that contain multiple repo entries like above
[21:42:33] <tirnanog> before getting into that, my first thought would be one of whether dnf is able to be told to request the exact information in question, and to format the output somewhat more neatly.

[21:46:41] <Guest28> Using this example, dnf outputs files containing lines that contain the entry "Repo: @System", or that same line plus additional lines starting with "Repo: [PKG_NAME]". I want to filter those files and add the package names to a list. So only get the package names that contain "Repo: @Sytem", plus additional lines containing "Repo". Is that
[21:46:41] <Guest28> clearer?
[21:46:44] <Guest28> Repo        : @System
[21:46:44] <Guest28> Repo        : a-rhel82-s390x-base
[21:46:45] <Guest28> Repo        : a-rhel84-s390x-base
[21:46:49] <tirnanog> no, I understand.
[21:47:38] <Guest28> I already have the loop setup up, was trying to simply using grep -c count option and just make a list of packages that contain more then one line, but its not specific enough, I actually want to read the string
[21:47:40] <tirnanog> I'm just saying that a solution could be slightly neater in the event that the tool can be used in a more directed fashion. but anyway.
[21:48:45] <Guest28> sure I'd love a more optimal way

[22:44:00] <tirnanog> in case you're wondering, the reason for not feeding the read loop by way of a pipeline is so that the activity is kept in the foreground shell. in particular, for the benefit of the simplistic error handling there.
[22:44:21] <tirnanog> activity being the invocation of git itself.
[22:46:41] <maxzor> ok, this helps untangling also
[22:47:20] <tirnanog> # echo line | while read -r; do exit; done; echo "... but I'm still going"

[22:49:52] <maxzor> bash is ok right
[22:49:59] <tirnanog> bash and sh are fine here.
[22:50:13] *** Joins: useretailz (~useretail@31.41.69.140)
[22:50:34] <tirnanog> in any case, the implication is that zsh didn't employ a subshell for the last command of the pipeline. bash does, normally.
[22:51:36] <maxzor> what is the last command of the pipeline here?
[22:52:26] <jelly> while read -r
[22:52:41] <tirnanog> the while...done is a compound command. as you can see, it does not use |.
[22:53:09] <tirnanog> the function does employ a pipeline. the function is executed in a subshell that comes into existence as a result of the <(process substitution).
[22:53:39] <tirnanog> that's combined with the < redirection operator. it makes more sense when you see how a process substitution expands.

[22:56:50] <tirnanog> in summary, it's one way of making sure that, should the "exit" occur, it happens in the intended shell; that is, the one that was initially spawned to process the script.
[22:57:49] <tirnanog> another solution could have been like:
