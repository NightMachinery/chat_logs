[13:25:54] <icing> ^^
[13:26:11] <zelest> woohoo! it works perfectly!
[13:26:18] <bagder> \o/
[13:26:39] * zelest is doing a lot of security labs exploiting various SQL injections..
[13:26:50] <Piru> good
[13:26:52] <zelest> was using PHP for automation and such.. figured I'll switch to C to learn C while I'm at it :)
[13:27:06] <zelest> or, get better at C that is
[13:27:23] <Piru> I use pycurl a lot for that stuff
[13:27:35] <zelest> yeah, python is on the todo as well
[13:28:02] <Piru> or just get lazy and use sqlmap :P
[13:28:14] <zelest> haha, the goal is to understand and learn the vulns :P
[13:28:50] <zelest> goal is to do *all* labs over at portswigger and complete the natas wargames at overthewire
[13:29:25] <Piru> yeah it certainly is more useful to actually do it yourself
[13:29:55] <zelest> I did my first blind SQL injection vuln yesterday.. it's scary how much data you can extract, even if the application doesn't print a single thing :)
[13:30:03] <Piru> since you of course need to understand how the vulnerability works
[13:30:08] <zelest> yeah
[13:30:34] <zelest> been doing web and sql for the last 15+ years, so I do have a good understanding on how to defend myself against it.. but figured I learn how to exploit it as well :)
[13:30:36] <Piru> sure 1 bit is enough to leak ton of stuff if you have time
[13:30:42] <zelest> mhm
[13:30:48] <zelest> time or automation ;)
[13:31:02] <zelest> speaking of time..
[13:31:07] <Piru> basically select substr 1 char a time and then each bit indifidually per char
[13:31:10] <zelest> you can even exploit things like sleep()
[13:31:25] <zelest> "oh, the query was successful, since the request took 10 seconds to load"
[13:31:29] <Piru> that'll take a very long time of course
[13:31:38] <zelest> yeah
[13:32:10] <Piru> but say for stealing admin password hash it'd be enough
[13:32:33] <zelest> the lab yesterday used a plaintext password, of course.. and it was exploited that way
[13:32:37] <zelest> but a hash works too, of course :)
[13:32:49] <Piru> yeah if the password is poor it can then be cracked
[13:33:03] <Piru> but for simple labs cleartext password is more rewarding
[13:33:09] <zelest> just encrypt it with base64 and rot13!
[13:33:15] <Piru> you'll instantly know you're doing it right
[13:33:22] <zelest> yeah
[13:33:26] <Piru> for a lab that is nice
[13:34:22] <zelest> portswigger has tons of other labs.. file uploads, file path incluions, XSS, etc
[13:34:40] <Piru> anyway, if you need any help just ask. been doing this stuff professionally for 15 years now :)
[13:34:49] <zelest> thanks :)
[13:35:03] <zelest> yeah, been at it back and forth for about the same amount of time

[14:23:11] <gevaerts> How easy it is to mitm connections is something I'm not sure about, and a lot depends about the service in question I think. For "important" stuff certificate pinning is probably a good idea I guess
