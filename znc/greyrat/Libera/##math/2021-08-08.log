[01:16:06] <riv> short for river
[01:16:13] <Z-module> in this case's notation, it's actually  P[A intersect B]/P[A]
[01:16:20] <mawk> ah
[01:16:21] <LTCD> mawk Yeah, riv got it wrong, it is: http://www.stat.yale.edu/Courses/1997-98/101/cond.gif
[01:16:39] <LTCD> Z-module Yeah.
[01:16:40] <mawk> and bayes theorem tells that P(A|B)P(B) = P(B|A)P(A) = P(A intersect B)
[01:16:47] <Z-module> so you "narrow the scope" to just the cases of A holding, and see what proportion of those also have B holding

[01:17:44] <Z-module> pretty sure the exercise in this link here wants them to just calculate direclty, not use Bayes
[01:18:04] <trinity> So i have 4 data points which are the illumination of the moon over a month, when it is new half full etc
[01:18:21] <LTCD> Z-module Did I get the answer of 0.2 correct?
[01:18:30] <trinity> So it is 0, .5 or 1
[01:18:32] <mawk> what do the data points represent trinity ? it's something over time?
[01:18:42] <mawk> you have 4 illumination values ?
[01:18:45] <trinity> So the wave starts at 0 abd goes to 1
[01:18:59] <mawk> you want to fit a sinus over your 4 data points trinity is that right?
[01:19:04] <mawk> a sine*
[01:19:12] <trinity> So the amplitude is .5
[01:19:19] <mawk> go back, the amplitude of what?
[01:19:24] <trinity> Half the height
[01:19:27] <mawk> do you want to fit a sine wave if I understand correctly?
[01:19:31] <mawk> amplitude of what?
[01:19:38] <mawk> what is the unit of 0.5 ? what does this value represent?
[01:20:00] <Z-module> in this one,   A cap B = {c}, so Pr(A cap B) = Pr(c) = 0.1,  while Pr(A) = Pr(a) + Pr(c) + Pr(e) = 0.5,  so the final answer is 0.1/0.5 = 0.2
[01:20:12] <trinity> And the vericle shift is .5 also as it sits above thex axis or on it starting at 0 and going to 1
[01:20:14] <LTCD> Z-module Perfect! Thanks!

[02:16:23] <Fangs> so our course on riemann surfaces was talking about how you can't define residue of a function f at a point as the coefficient of (z-z0)^{-1}, you had to instead compute the residue of an "f dz" 1-form
[02:16:32] <Fangs> is the differential form really necessary here?

[02:18:16] <Fangs> but.. when you integrate f against dz, and you let w(z), you wouldn't integrate f wrt to dw, you'd integrate f(z) dz/dw dw

[04:59:19] <LTCD> Hey. This definition seems wrong to be, for example if Ω = {Head, Tails} and the event A is when we flip a heads, why are we writing  A ⊆ Ω. Definition: An event is a subset A ⊆ Ω of the sample space.
[05:00:28] <LTCD> I thought we should be using the ⊂ symbol, as the event A would be either Head or Tail, a proper subset (meaning it lacks at least one element) of Ω.
[05:00:55] <buster> Fangs, orthogonal how?
[05:01:25] <jmorris> LTCD: it's a proper subset in this case but that isn't necessary for it to be an event
[05:01:38] <jmorris> the definition is correct
[05:02:35] <LTCD> jmorris I think I got the two symbols confused with my blasted dyslexia.
[05:03:13] <jmorris> doesn't seem so
[05:03:35] <Fangs> consider {K(v) : v in V}, if we take a vector here, and hit it with A, we want it to still be in this subspace. so this ammounts to checking A(K(v)) = K(some vector). Indeed is A(K(v)) = A(v - c(v)/c(w) w) = Av - c(v)/c(w) Aw, and Aw = K(Aw) + c(Aw)/c(w) w,so we have A(K(v)) = Av - c(v)/c(w)K(Aw) + c(v)/c(w)c(Aw)/c(w) w <-- I think I should give up on this line of inquiry
[05:04:33] <Fangs> what's true though is if Av = cv, then K(Av) = cK(v)

[05:14:15] <Fangs> jmorris: shouldnt an event be an element of the sample space?
[05:14:43] <Fangs> buster: if [A,B] = 0, then A and B has a common eigenvector in that space
[05:15:18] <Fangs> buster: if [A,B]v = c(v)w has rank 1, and c(w)=/=0 then naively I thought I was going to take V, 'substract' w from it, and hit it with the easier lemma
[05:15:35] <buster> so write v = lambda * (c(v)w + K(v)), where K(v)=c(w)v-c(v)w ... that has the advantage that K is a linear transformation

[05:19:24] <jmorris> Fangs: "turning up even" is the event, it's the set {2,4,6}

[07:22:26] <mefistofeles> mawk: if smooth
[07:22:40] <mawk> assume f is smooth already
[07:23:06] <mawk> I mean a peak can be narrow or wide, so how to quantify the narrowness
[07:23:17] <Fangs> mawk: if you think of f'(t) as a velocity vector, f''(t) is its deacceleration
[07:23:19] <mefistofeles> mawk: I don't think there's a single best way
[07:23:41] <mawk> I thought of max(f') in a small region around the peak, but I have yet to determine the appropriate region
[07:23:51] <mawk> a small [x-ε; x+ε] region
[07:23:53] <mefistofeles> but a way (not even sure it's a good one) is fitting some kind of function (parabolic should work) and get the parameters
[07:23:56] <Fangs> so wouldn't the more negative f''(t) is, the 'pointier' the peak?
[07:24:10] <mefistofeles> locally around the peak, that is
[07:24:16] <mefistofeles> depends on how many points you actually have around it
[07:24:23] <mawk> you're right Fangs yes
[07:24:45] <mefistofeles> Fangs: true
[07:24:51] <Fangs> I like to think of f(t) as a curve on the x-y plane, then you can think of it physically
[07:24:57] <PlanckWalk> You can have a peak with f'' = 0 at that point
[07:24:59] <mawk> yeah that's a nice trick

[07:25:00] <mefistofeles> I'm assuming this is some data points but I guess we have a continous function, right?
[07:25:56] <mawk> in theory it's continuous yes mefistofeles , I mean I have a limited set of data points but for any amount of data points, there exists as many smooth functions that passes through these points as you want
[07:26:07] <mawk> so any operation you do on them, it's as if you do it on a smooth function, right?
[07:26:27] <Fangs> PlanckWalk: whats the example?
[07:26:30] <mawk> for instance there exists a whole lot of polynomials that passes through the points, even though it might not be the best thing to approximate your data with
[07:26:49] <mawk> PlanckWalk: but then would the peak be very peaky ? wouldn't it have a plateau?
[07:26:59] <PlanckWalk> mawk: Some of those smooth functions will have "peaks" wayyyy beyond your fixed points
[07:27:06] <tusko> Is it generally advised to avois solving ODEs with matrix methods if any other method would work to solve the given problem?
[07:27:08] <Fangs> PlanckWalk: there's that example of a function where its taylor sieries is identically zero at 0, but the function is (obviously) non-identically zero in any nbhd of 0
[07:27:11] <PlanckWalk> mawk: It can be a tiny plateau
[07:27:26] <mawk> PlanckWalk: so we have to look at the value of f'' on a neighborhood of the point
[07:27:35] <mawk> what do you mean with the fixed points?
[07:27:43] <PlanckWalk> Your data points
[07:27:49] <mawk> ah
[07:27:54] <mawk> yes of course
[07:28:02] <PlanckWalk> You treat those as fixed and have an infinitely family of smooth functions interpolating them
[07:28:10] <mawk> yes
[07:28:20] <PlanckWalk> Fangs: Yes, that's one example
[07:28:25] <mawk> but then I assume that "the" smooth function I'm doing everything on is the simplest one that passes through my points
[07:28:30] <PlanckWalk> But even something like -x^4 is an example
[07:28:33] <mawk> like, no funny zigzaging between
[07:28:49] <PlanckWalk> "Simplest" is very subjective
[07:29:01] <mawk> yeah
[07:29:15] <PlanckWalk> Even then, say, cubic interpolation is very simple but can overshoot
[07:29:16] <Fangs> PlanckWalk: thanks, that should've been obvious

[07:30:16] <mawk> but I'm not doing interpolation, I was talking about this smooth interpolation just as for a kind of "philosophical" argument to mefistofeles, to say that a finite set of points always belongs to a smooth function
[07:32:15] <PlanckWalk> Finding peaks in discrete data needs some sort of underlying model.
[07:32:35] <mawk> for the definition of simplest, I suppose it means for instance that between x_i and x_{i+1}, f(x) shouldn't be too far off from f(x_i) + (f(x_{i+1}) - f(x_i)) (x - x_i)/(x_{i+1}-x_i)
[07:32:51] <PlanckWalk> Okay, so basically linear interpolation
[07:33:02] <PlanckWalk> Or not far from it
[07:33:20] <mawk> yes, my data isn't varying a lot between time steps
[07:33:49] <PlanckWalk> Is it noisy?

[09:02:19] <Gustavo6046> isn't pi the halfway point of a single sine wave cycle or period?
[09:02:27] <cherim> But even if you make the interval smaller so that sin(x) keeps constant sign, it will be an integer provided the endpoints are multiples of pi/2
[09:02:35] <Gustavo6046> and since sin(x) goes up and then down, the stretch from 0 to pi should be positive

[09:03:28] <cherim> So what interval do you change to?
[09:04:10] <cherim> Will [0, pi] do? sin(x)>=0 there.
[09:04:10] <Gustavo6046> hm
[09:04:17] <Gustavo6046> but that was what I had in mind
[09:04:21] <Gustavo6046> ohhhh
[09:04:29] <Gustavo6046> I typed the original sentence wrong
[09:04:34] <Gustavo6046> I meant pi, not 2pi
[09:04:36] <Gustavo6046> apologies
[09:04:40] <cherim> \int _0^{pi} sin(x)dx = cos(0)-cos(pi)=2
[09:04:46] <cherim> How is this related to the area?
[09:05:12] <cherim> I mean, it's the area under sin(x), but to the circle?
[09:05:36] <Gustavo6046> I was thinking the integral of a sine wave from 0 to pi would be a semicircle, since the sine of theta is the vertical position of a point in a circle if it goes theta anti-clockwise around the circle from the rightmost position
[09:06:01] <Gustavo6046> but I should have paid more attention
[09:06:14] <Gustavo6046> turns out the sine wave has a diagonal slope at the x intercepts (0, pi, 2pi, ...) rather than a vertical one
[09:06:26] <cherim> Areas in integrals come from decompositions into infinitesimal rectangles
[09:06:36] <cherim> So let's consider a circle r=1
[09:06:55] <cherim> You can parametrize it not by the x-coordinate, but by the angle
[09:07:04] <Gustavo6046> which now that I think about it makes sense, since sin takes an angle, but an integral goes over the space of x linearly
[09:07:14] <Gustavo6046> yep!
[09:07:21] <Gustavo6046> that was my mistake
[09:07:59] <cherim> So angles t and t+dt define two points on the circle. Let's consider the part between vertical lines x=const through these points
[09:08:22] <cherim> y-coordiante is sin(t) and sin(t+dt) ~ sin(t), so it's almost a rectangle
[09:08:24] <Gustavo6046> mhm
[09:08:30] <Gustavo6046> the width of that part varies with the tangential slope
[09:08:31] <cherim> But what about the horizontal span?
[09:08:31] <Gustavo6046> right?
[09:08:39] <cherim> Yes, the x-span is not dt
[09:08:44] <Gustavo6046> yeah
[09:09:06] <cherim> x=cos(t), so the s-span is cos(t+dt)-cos(t) ~ dcos(t)
[09:09:28] <Gustavo6046> yes, but isn't it easier to use tan?
[09:09:50] <Gustavo6046> since the slope of the tangent is the slope that determines the offset of the points
[09:09:52] <cherim> Now you do indeed get the area as \int_0^{\pi} sin(t) d(-cos(t)) = \int_0^{\pi} sin^2(t) dt = pi/2
[09:10:04] <cherim> Of the upper half-disk
[09:10:04] <Gustavo6046> and therefore determines the relationship between the angle offset and the x offset
[09:10:52] <cherim> Yes, but tan relates dx and dy. Your natural variable is the angle t here
[09:11:04] <Gustavo6046> Ahh.
[09:11:38] <cherim> dt is the length along the circumference, so you project it with sin(t)
[09:11:58] <cherim> But just noting that x=cos(t) in your parametrization is less error-prone
[09:12:10] <Gustavo6046> Yeah, I see now
[09:12:19] <Gustavo6046> :)
[09:12:41] <Gustavo6046> Why is the differential part of the integral negative cos?
[09:12:57] <cherim> Because increasing t corresponds to decreasing x
[09:12:58] <Gustavo6046> Wait, does it varying by a different expression mean that the t is proportional to that?
[09:13:05] <Gustavo6046> Oh yeah, because counter-clockwise
[09:13:15] <Gustavo6046> But isn't it still above the curve?
[09:13:24] <cherim> If you want unsigned area, you have to subtract cos(t+dt) from cos(t), not vice versa
[09:13:25] <Gustavo6046> The amount of area would still be the same since it's symmetrical, right?
[09:13:46] <Gustavo6046> Plus the sine is still squared at the end
[09:13:49] <Gustavo6046> Or maybe it's just good practice
[09:14:02] <cherim> The final sin^2 uses that minus
[09:14:08] <cherim> You'd get -pi/2 without
[09:14:11] <Gustavo6046> Ah
[09:14:46] <cherim> Which also has meaning, but if we only go "area is a sum of areas of small rectangles", we'd better keep all summands positive
[09:16:27] <Gustavo6046> true

[11:02:00] *** Quits: bosspotato__ (~bosspotat@user/bosspotato) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[11:02:48] <tusko> uh, ok sec
[11:02:54] <tusko> let me gather myself
[11:04:00] <tusko> A linear operator B acting in an n-dimensional space K_n is said to be nilpotent if B^r=0 (i.e. if B^Rx=0 for every x \in K_n) for some positive integer r.
[11:04:42] <cherim> I think it's better to use K^n if K is the base field, but OK
[11:05:35] <tusko> Given a nilpotent operator B such that B^r=0, we assume that B^{r-1} \neq 0, i.e., that there are vectors x \in K_n such that B^{r-1}x \neq 0. By the 'height' of a vector x \in K_n, we mean the smallest positive integer m for which B^Mx=0.

[11:07:55] <cherim> The authors have very strange writing style
[11:08:17] <cherim> But it's clear what they want. What is the question again?
[11:08:31] <tusko> Given any k<=r, let H_k denote the set of all vectors of height <=k. Obviously, H_kk is a subspace of K_n. In fact, if x,y \in H_k, then B^kx=0, B^ky=0 and hence B^k(\alpha x + \beta y) = 0 for arbitrary \alpha, \beta \in K, so that the height of the vector \alpha x + \beta y does not exceed k, i.e., \alpha x + \beta y \in H_k.
[11:08:46] <tusko> Moreover, it is obvious that H_r = K_n and that
[11:09:20] <tusko> {0} = H_0 \subset H_1 \subset ... \subset H_{r-1} \subset H_r = K_n.
[11:09:27] <tusko> I'm just trying to understand wtf I just read.
[11:09:44] <tusko> and what that says about the kernel of a nilpotent matrix specifically.

[12:27:46] <riv> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fano_plane#Block_design_theory maybe the incidence matrix is a code

[12:28:19] <riv> ahhh i see!
[12:28:47] <Fangs> and not just one to one correspondence, the incidence/etc structure has to do with boolean logic on the venn diagram

[15:42:51] <rapha> Fangs: W: got a bunch of points that, when plotted, look like a sawtooth, and want to convert them into a bunch of points that, when plotted, look like a straight line falling off from left to right. sooo, maybe it's just a linear fit?
[15:43:17] <Inline> you might want to look for quaternions gulzar
[15:43:40] <Fangs> if p is a points of your object you just take a rotation matrix M and apply it to p, and you get the rotated point Mp, gulzar
[15:43:50] <rtbn> gulzar, the most straightforward way i know of is using rotation matrices (that's how a lot of 3d design software does it), but quaternions are recently becoming a popular way to do it too, as Inline just said
[15:44:36] <rtbn> 3blue1brown even made an interactive video (with help from Ben Eater) explaining the latter
[15:45:03] <Fangs> the rotation matrix (counterclockwise) is [cos t, -sin t; sin t, cos t], where t is the angle of rotation gulzar
[15:45:22] <Fangs> so if you want a rotation that fixes the z axis, (rotation in the x-y plane) you just take that matrix
[15:45:35] <Fangs> [cos t, -sin t 0; sin t, cos t 0; 0 0 1]

[15:46:22] <Fangs> (you put that matrix and add a row and a column and add 1in the diagonal.. so think of it as having rotation matrix on the top left, 0 on the top right, bottom left, and a 1 in the bottom right)
[15:46:32] <Inline> gulzar: visualizing quaternions is a good book for that i think
[15:46:39] <Fangs> gulzar: is you just move where this row and column of 0s and 1s you can fix the x and y axis too
[15:48:05] <gulzar> I found this https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/programming-games-visualizations/programming-3d-shapes/a/rotating-3d-shapes   but it's flattening or moving my object instead of rotation. Seems I am not able to understand something

[19:03:27] <Z-module> not really
[19:03:56] <qergle> Here's a common defn for cover: Given a set X and a subset S of X. A family/collection C of subsets of X is a cover for S (ie C covers S) iff S ⊆ ⋃ C

[19:45:00] <Z-module> well, it's sort of generically interchangeable, especially when talking about open coverings as is most often the case. If M is a metric space and S is any subset of M, then S is also a metric space by inheriting the metric from M. Every open set in this metric space S has the form  U cap S   where U is an open set of M.  So an (in the bigger sense) open covering D of S in the space M, meaning D is a bunch of M-open sets whose union
[19:45:00] <Z-module> contains S, corresponds to an open covering D' of S considered entirely as a metric space unto itself, by changing each U in D to the set  U cap S.
[19:45:54] <Z-module> (also, coverings aren't restricted to be only countable, so try to resist the notation D = {U_1, U_2, ...} in general)

[20:14:36] <Z-module> <Z-module> well, it's sort of generically interchangeable, especially when talking about open coverings as is most often the case. If M is a

[20:14:56] <Z-module> <Z-module> (also, coverings aren't restricted to be only countable, so try to resist the notation D = {U_1, U_2, ...} in general)
