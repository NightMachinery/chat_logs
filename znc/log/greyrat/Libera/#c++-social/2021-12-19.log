[19:38:30] <hinst> i will start calling it pee-pee as soon as she stops talking to too many boys, I guess
[19:43:18] <aniketgm> Weird. But it's clearly the difference of cultures. Or maybe that kid who left the meeting was brought-up in a house where, they never used such terms.

[20:18:13] <T`aZ> it's dutch
[20:18:15] <T`aZ> it works
[20:18:31] <Oxyd> Must be nice for things to work.
[20:18:34] <T`aZ> sadly here in .be it takes 5 days to send a regular letter, but
[20:18:57] <T`aZ> i dont know how they do it
[20:19:29] <Oxyd> In other news, there's been a water leak somewhere in the apartment building where I live. Nobody knows where it is. So far all we know is that there's this nasty, growing wet spot on my wall, and there's water dripping down in the basement.
[20:20:57] <Renderwww> how can it take 5 days to send a letter in .be? whole country can probably be corssed by foot in 2 hours
[20:21:24] <Oxyd> All the lunch breaks take all the tme.

[22:00:58] <Plazma> so i know everyone has their own thoughts on the virus and vaccinations, and that's fine.. I don't even get all butthurt over 'misinformation' spreading -- but when people i once respected and looked to almost as parental or sibling figures spout shit like this -- it really fucking hurts - https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/690888170073620591/921986008701100073/IMG_0594.png
