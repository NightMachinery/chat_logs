[03:03:07] <bugweiser> *for example* we read over here (https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-howto.html) that: 
[03:03:36] <bugweiser>  it's okay to use a range (“2008-2010”) instead of listing individual years (“2008, 2009, 2010”) if and only if every year in the range, inclusive, really is a “copyrightable” year that would be listed individually; and you make an explicit statement in your documentation about this usage.

[03:19:07] <yrk> bugweiser: what's the motivation behind the question. it seems very specific. what is the problem that you are trying to solve? I assume that people would be more motivated to stop whatever they are doing to help with such a question if they knew why
[03:19:59] <yrk> for example: "savannah won't accept my project until I fix this aspect of its licensing"
[03:21:05] <bugweiser> yrk, regarding the first question (granting rights somwhere in a faq and use a more restrictive license notice in each file), or the second question (where can I find this explicit statement that clarifies the use of ranges in years in the copyright notice (the latter i think i clarified, but I am happy to further clarify it).

[03:28:47] <bugweiser> your work is automatically 'copyright you'. Couse berne yada.

[03:40:33] <bugweiser> while I understand your 'water' example, I don't feel this is a fair comparison. Given the uncertanty of wether a license is a contract or (whatever), and noting that GPL (per your example) is deemed a contract in USA and in France, then we are generally advising people into legally binding contracts on an international basis.

[03:47:45] <bugweiser> Think github gist (as practical example).
[03:47:52] <bugweiser> I'll wiki that for you

[03:50:43] <yrk> bugweiser: in conclusion, I think you'll find more purchase if you motivate your questions with practical application: if there is a fire, shout for help so people can douse it. but if you run in shouting that you want to decrease the likelyhood of future hypothetical fires... you get people a bit less worked up
[03:53:05] <yrk> bugweiser: I'll still try to get those questions answered from the fsf via licensing@fsf.org though (if you send them in). they get far weirder and more nit-picky questions on a regular basis
[03:54:57] <bugweiser> yes they are nitpicky (and intentionally narrow, as it seems broad questions (should) get broad answers). But i'm genuinly thankful you do recognese them as an honest attempt to understand the basics (instead of just crying wolf).
[03:56:33] <yrk> bugweiser: to be sure, in my opinion there is nothing wrong with the questions in and of themselves. it is that you present them as serious problems and insinuate that something Very Bad(tm) is happening because we don't have these answers
[03:57:16] <yrk> bugweiser: ..in which case you then need to follow that up with pointing out the specific Bad Things(tm) so that the community can gather around and fix them
[03:57:30] *** Joins: xiews (~wxie@101.93.23.227)
[03:59:30] <bugweiser> I think the real main 'bad thing' is encapsulated in my description of my experience as average joe trying to understand the basics. More to the point, the people ive talked to in the past, stumbled on this exact issue (excluding joining an existing project with an already set license or contractual employment stuff). 
[04:00:04] <bugweiser> I appear to fall in the same category (having always postponed it, though having done some other attempts over the years).
[04:00:14] <bugweiser> At some point you give up.
[04:00:40] <bugweiser> Loads of younger devs I spoke to over the (say past 5) years indicate the same..
[04:00:55] <yrk> bugweiser: what's the "bad thing"? you tried to release a project and it failed? what's the "bad thing" specifically?
[04:01:12] <bugweiser> they (and I) feel coerced into making a decision/choice which is presented from the interest and perspective of whomever wrote the tutorial or gave the advice.
[04:01:38] <bugweiser> I'm trying to expalin this bad thing currently.
[04:01:43] <bugweiser> explain
[04:01:56] <yrk> bugweiser: yes, and if you payed a lawyer to write a custom license for you, then you would still be under the influence of their personal legal theories
[04:02:07] <bugweiser> YES
[04:02:26] <bugweiser> you can't expect people to take an international legal course with their lawyer.
[04:02:27] *** Quits: xiews (~wxie@101.93.23.227) (Remote host closed the connection)
[04:02:31] <yrk> bugweiser: but... and this is the main point: how does this actually stop you from releasing the software in question?
[04:02:53] <bugweiser> lol, it needs a licence dunnit, for others to use it?
[04:03:16] <yrk> bugweiser: then use one

[04:04:24] <bugweiser> that makes 'pick a license, *any* license' equivalent to russian roulette, just with all chambers filled with a live bullit.
[04:04:28] <yrk> bugweiser: ...then why do that with licenses?
[04:05:07] <bugweiser> lol, I kinda do code that way..
[04:05:28] <bugweiser> why do that with a license? Legally binding contract (depending which judge you ask)
[04:05:34] *** Quits: notzmv (~zmv@user/notzmv) (Ping timeout: 268 seconds)
[04:06:49] <bugweiser> seems kind of 'hypocrytical' to take licenses serious (from a legal point of view) when it suits us, and shrug when it doesn't suit us, no?
[04:07:01] <yrk> bugweiser: same with programming
[04:07:45] *** Quits: cavemanr_ (~cavemanr@227-135-067-156.ip-addr.inexio.net) (Remote host closed the connection)
[04:08:12] <yrk> bugweiser: your demands from understanding licensing do not seem to be commensurate with your programming efforts
[04:08:19] <bugweiser> how so?
[04:08:47] <yrk> bugweiser: the question isn't if you understand licensing utterly, but if you understand it enough to achieve your project's goals
[04:09:18] *** Joins: notzmv (~zmv@user/notzmv)
[04:09:22] <yrk> bugweiser: there are very few projects that need more than to follow the how-tos of the popular apache-2.0/gpl licenses
[04:09:46] <yrk> bugweiser: ..and there are hundreds of thousands that simply do exactly that and have no issue
[04:10:03] <yrk> bugweiser: the question is, what is it about your project that is different?
[04:10:23] <bugweiser> hmm, it's in the interest of the project that the author doesn't get into legal problems, therefor it is relevant for the author to understand what they are agreeing to from a legal international perspective (excluding what grants the author whishes to give).
[04:10:43] <yrk> bugweiser: ...but only to the extent that it actually makes sense
[04:10:59] <yrk> bugweiser: you speak in absolutes, but you need to speak in measures instead
[04:11:15] <yrk> bugweiser: the copyright holders need to understand _enough_, not everything
[04:11:19] <bugweiser> hence, the basics. 
[04:11:37] <yrk> bugweiser: and the osi/fsf publish what their legal teams have deemed to be enough
[04:11:50] <yrk> bugweiser: you are stating that it isn't, but not saying or showing why
[04:12:25] <bugweiser> :(  It feels I did point out clear examples
[04:12:34] <yrk> bugweiser: you state that the osi don't publish enough of what you call the "basics". what do you know about software licensing that the osi do not?
[04:13:05] <bugweiser> please let me try to clarifying what I mean by an example.
[04:13:13] <yrk> bugweiser: are you implying that organizations like the fsf and osi are being negligent in not providing critical information for the community
[04:13:28] <yrk> bugweiser: but that obviously isn't happenning in practice
[04:14:04] <yrk> creative commons do pretty much the same
[04:14:05] <bugweiser> NO, I didn't say that !!! Probably if you dig long and deep enough one will find sufficient hints. But that in turn is precicely the main 'fire'.
[04:14:31] <yrk> bugweiser:  a fire destroys something. what exactly is being destroyed?
[04:15:05] <yrk> bugweiser: you are pointing outside and shouting fire, and we are all running outside and see a beautiful summer day (apologies to antipodian readers)
[04:15:27] <bugweiser> let me attempt a clear narrow example (which also should attempt the 'how much basics' item raised)
[04:15:44] <yrk> bugweiser: can you please make it an instance, and not an example?
[04:16:02] <bugweiser> I'll google instance vs example
[04:16:04] <yrk> bugweiser: which is to say. you tried to publish software X, but you failed because Y happened in reality?
[04:16:39] <bugweiser> ok, I think I can do that.
[04:17:00] <yrk> that would be excellent
[04:18:12] *** Quits: getSomethingGood (~getSometh@d72-39-70-155.home1.cgocable.net) (Remote host closed the connection)
[04:18:51] <bugweiser> I tried to publish software X, and failed becouse I needed to choose a license Y. In my average joe attempt to solve Y, I read seemingly authoritive articles online. They stated (generalised example): 'under berne convention (most countries are), your work is automatically copyright protected'. 
[04:19:10] <bugweiser> It turned out that this wasn't so (see previous examples roughly half an hour ago).
[04:19:38] <yrk> bugweiser: the vast majority of "average joe/ann" just use a free software license and are happy
[04:19:39] <bugweiser> I didn't feel I had a sufficiant overview in the subject, the articles I read no longer felt sufficiently 'complete'/'correct'.
[04:20:13] <bugweiser> average joe must spend more time (and more time... etc.) and ultimately gave up (and just did POSS).
[04:20:18] <yrk> bugweiser: so no, the process didn't fail. you _chose_ not to trust any existing license and you _chose_ not to trust the information publised by the organizations who wrote those licenses
[04:20:50] <bugweiser> (end of instance).
[04:21:06] <yrk> bugweiser: I have no idea why you don't trust them, seeing as I'm writing this to you via an entire operating system written and distributed worldwide using those exactly licenses from those exact organizations
[04:21:19] <yrk> bugweiser: somehow, that isn't good enough for you
[04:21:55] <yrk> bugweiser: what you haven't shown is how your case is somehow different from the cases of every since piece of software in my trisquel gnu/linux operating system
[04:22:04] <bugweiser> that is not what I am trying to say. 
[04:22:25] <yrk> bugweiser: but it is what you end up saying
[04:22:50] <yrk> bugweiser: you don't _know_ if the licensing information is insufficient because you never tried to use it
[04:23:14] <yrk> bugweiser: it is like you are refusing to use a debugger until you are absolutely sure that the code can have no bugs
[04:23:37] <bugweiser> what I am trying to say is that it is not 'fair' 'free' to basically tell people: draw 6 licenses out of a jar, number them, throw a die and that is your license. No you do not need to understand what you just did or chose or even what legal implications that might hold for you in the future.
[04:23:58] <bugweiser> .. that *is* a fire. It leads to POSS.
[04:24:04] <yrk> bugweiser: that would indeed be unfair. but it isn't reality
[04:24:50] <bugweiser> please show me (as you agree that is indeed unfair, and noting I *am* trying to point out that this is how quite a number of devs feel about the subject).
[04:25:03] <yrk> bugweiser: you don't trust the system. that is your choice, but that isn't a condemnation of that system
[04:25:11] <bugweiser> I didnt' say that

[05:36:42] <madage> bugweiser: try not to think of law/license as code, but as an agreement or a chater of intentions, instead of worrying so much on how would a given judge on a give country on a given day on a given lawsuit would interpret the license and copyright legislation (national and international), you may gain some perspective if you think the the purpose of the license is to state a commitment
[05:37:29] <madage> so if you hide your license in a faq or somewhere else, third parties might miss it and assume it is your copyright and no license offered to the general public

[05:52:10] <bugweiser> madage, thanks for helping! Your last message, I grasp (howevermuch I don't like that :) ). 
[05:52:38] <bugweiser> as for the 'license in a faq' question, it's obviously based on this interesting thing (in this particular regard) that the gpl does.
[05:53:27] <bugweiser> the license text is restricted with a more restictive license note (regarding the license text itself), compared with the 'human speech' given in the faq. (I can give links/ref if wanted).
[05:54:05] <bugweiser> hence the question: does the 'human text' in the faq count as a more relaxed/permissive license from a legal perspective?
[05:54:39] <bugweiser> (in short, the license notice says: no modify, the faq says: ok to modify IIF ..conditions..)
[05:55:48] <bugweiser> as to your first message: 
[05:57:01] <bugweiser> let's (for the sake of argument) call a 'public license' (whatever we think it is) conservatively 'a legally binding agreement' (and intentionally leave out distinctions between contract, unilateral contract, license etc. out of it for now).
[05:57:59] <bugweiser> Shouldn't a dev (average joe) care not to knowingly commit a civil offence (punishable up to $220000 + yada) ?
[05:58:43] <bugweiser> shouldn't average joe at least be warned about such an example, letting average joe decide if they want to commit that offense or not ?
[05:59:57] <bugweiser> (to avoid miscommunication: I'm currently only interested in the *main* legal implications of such a 'legally binding agreement'. NOT which rights we license/grant/carve-up)
[06:00:10] *** Quits: dconklin (~Thunderbi@c-67-171-158-249.hsd1.or.comcast.net) (Quit: dconklin)
[06:00:39] <bugweiser> wouldn't it even be *immoral* to advise/suggest/guide someone to commit a civil offence, without at least warning average joe?
[06:00:40] <corwin> (aside: I like yr nick bugweiser :D)
[06:00:46] <bugweiser> thx corwin!
[06:01:54] <madage> in that regard it is helpful to remember that most legal systems have some notion of "good faith", so even if the license itself says you cannot modify it, that fact that there is a faq saying you can modify on some conditions is not negligible. In court, if ever, fsf you have a hard time persuing damages if someone showed that they behaved according to the faq
[06:02:52] <madage> so it's not a advise to commit a tort, is effectively changing what fsf could expect to be held in court
[06:03:44] <madage> ..fsf would have a hard time...
[06:04:03] <bugweiser> ok, clear. allow me to stress/clarify that the potential immoral thing is NOT related to the GPL faq license thing. 2 seperate questions

[06:07:02] <madage> I need to go in a moment so I won't read that, but if I get the title right, on some legal systems you cannot do that
[06:07:16] <madage> or rather, you can, but it is void
[06:07:20] <bugweiser> (and in the mean-time, I'll disclaim myself : I know this is unlikely to go to court. But that doesn't seem a good excuse to do it anyway ..)
[06:07:22] <bugweiser> np
[06:07:41] <bugweiser> in some legal systems it's 'illegal'
[06:07:44] <bugweiser> just doing so.

[06:10:51] <madage> in that case, the only thing I could add is that for people who live under laws very different from the US, it could be advisable to hire a lawyer if you project starts to get a whole lot of attention/users
[06:11:38] <madage> we cannot hope FSF being the size it is will be able to have legal counsel for any given legal system on earth with the same quality
[06:12:16] <bugweiser> at least I now have a far better understanding of why that is (sadly) a good advice (noting, obviously, that is somewhat unrealistic for a world full of average joes wanting to contribute/create).
[06:12:25] <madage> but at the same time, if you are just starting your project, it would be too much to dive on legal issues before even getting something to release to the public
[06:12:28] <bugweiser> yes
[06:12:43] <bugweiser> I get that (in relation to the 100% you mentioned and I get).
[06:13:10] <bugweiser> but, can the world please get help to get a little more info than just the first 1%  ?
[06:14:11] <madage> heh.. could law be a little bit more reasonable and predictable everywhere?

[07:37:12] <bugweiser> it says:
[07:37:27] <bugweiser> We concluded that Plaintiff s work met the definition of a United States work under 17 U.S.C. § 101(1)(C) and that, pursuant to 17 U.S.C. § 411(a), Plaintiff was required to register AJE prior to suing for copyright infringement.
[07:38:00] <bugweiser> so I piced that together correctly, it was indeed 101(1)(C) that made the berne backdoor collapse
[07:38:09] <bugweiser>  
[07:38:19] <bugweiser> one down, so many questions left :)
[07:39:27] <bugweiser> What can be done to exclude USA from accessing content publised online for 31 days ?
[07:40:32] <bugweiser> (seems unfair to punish the handful of non-berne parties, and even if, then 101(1)(B) would apply, so that wouldn't solve anything).
[07:41:07] <bugweiser> why not: sorry US, no updates for you in the first 31 days, untill you fix your legal system to honor berne as advertised ?
[07:41:51] <iamweasel> copyright conventions supporting/enhancing current regime are currupt attempts to maximize the profit for rent-seekers
[07:42:58] <iamweasel> a sensible copyright convention would reduce the temporal lengh to 1 year or under, and make it explicitly legal to publish anything at all non-commercially 
[07:43:19] <iamweasel> however
[07:44:01] <iamweasel> this has to be coupled with legislation protecting democratic govs from non-free software, on pain of losing the advantage of gpl

[07:47:33] <bugweiser> I somewhat agree.. I'd accept somewhat longer temporal length (depending on case/class). And in my opinion there should be a utter simple method of not getting into a 'legally binding agreement' at all (for certain applications such as posting snippets/building-blocks).
[07:48:36] <iamweasel> bugweiser: you are totally right: the exact length is not as important as the obscenity which is 120 years or whatever it is now by some laws
[07:49:12] <iamweasel> plus minus 1, 2, 5 years is fine, especially if we take care to differentiate by genre
[07:49:41] <iamweasel> but the legality of non-commercial distribution of anything is key
[07:49:59] <bugweiser> yeah, exactly. It would be unfair to spend a year of marketing and then not be able to get your fair profit (and costs covered). It is not unreasonable to: give some/take some.
[07:50:14] <bugweiser> yeah, i very much agree.
[07:50:31] <iamweasel> there are vivid arguments to be made in these cases, for sure
[07:50:43] <bugweiser> that would also be the end of POSS (at least the devs who *did* try but gave up).

[07:54:12] <bugweiser> assuming USA has anti-tamper (no drm reversal etc.) provisions (part of international trade agreements).

[08:15:33] <iamweasel> from where you are, you can't block a region, in all reality, without either blocking that entire region outright (like nk) or making sure that using a vpn is a criminal offense (like china)
[08:16:52] <iamweasel> vpn is not used much, in terms of traffic flow, but it carries ALL the info one could possibly need
[08:17:51] <bugweiser> interesting, and interesting example (vpn china).
[08:18:34] <bugweiser> what would USA law say? USA citisens using vpn to circumvent a block for the region of USA ?
[08:19:30] <iamweasel> commercial attempts to do that are illegal and sometimes busted
[08:20:24] <iamweasel> but we all know, from anywhere in the world with working tcp/ip, one can access any shttp site they want
[08:20:50] <iamweasel> which means, no one can really see what's going on, only who is talking to who
[08:21:07] <bugweiser> hmm..
[08:21:22] <iamweasel> which is not enough, by itself, to trigger us law, unless one is talking to a listed spy or something
[08:22:02] <iamweasel> though i think all international shit is subject to warrantless surveilance here
[08:22:18] <iamweasel> which is why we use encryption
[08:23:10] <bugweiser> obviously, it would be fine if USA citisens used a vps/vpn to access the stuff (blocked to them for 31 days after publication). The effect one would be after is: 'we' could claim that the content was not pulicised in the USA, unless the infinger utilised a vps/vpn to access the material anyway..

[09:06:38] <Guest2297> ?
[09:06:48] <bugweiser> that would depend on the task/complexity of the tool (and perhaps the language you use to write it in).
[09:07:20] <bugweiser> additionally, if just a command-line interface suffices as opposed to a gui.
[09:09:58] <bugweiser> also, the unix-like systems are called that for a reason, they are more of an evolved descendent of the non-free unix
[09:10:38] <Guest2297> The Linux kernel + rest of the system, excluding gnu tools composes a larger part than the gnu tools themselves.

[09:21:15] <Guest2297> Why are there SO MANY distos of GNU/Linux systems, there is 1-5 distros of proprietary/ even other free/libre systems like FreeBSD , NetBSD and OpenBSD, currently in use, this means that it is fragmented. Is this the reason, that noone uses GNU/Linux on their desktop?

[09:23:03] <bugweiser> Guest2297, that is somewhat of an over-statement (especially to afficionado's) However, you are correct in part there. There *is* to much fragmentation.
[09:23:05] <feep> windows home, windows pro, windows pro, windows edu, windows ltsb, do you think this is why nobody's using windows on the desktop?
[09:23:20] <feep> s/pro/enterprise/
[09:23:30] <bugweiser> A lot of distro's are essentially skinned derivatives + some applications choosen by the distro.
[09:23:47] <bugweiser> on the other hand, a number of distro's focus on exceling in particular tasks.
[09:24:07] <feep> anyway, it's actually totally unrelated to this, microsoft just got windows preinstalled on every desktop you buy, then used questionable market tactics to lock users in, then took advantage of first-mover/platform effects to hamper competition
[09:24:12] <bugweiser> I personally think it is great advice, when choosing a distro, to ask: what is the distro's purpose?
[09:24:31] *** Joins: pandakekok9 (~job@wikimedia-commons/pandakekok9)
[09:24:54] <feep> microsoft are very very good at being a company
[09:26:07] <Guest2297> all of these windows "editions" have 99% same functionality, but GNU/Linux has ~10-20% if you include the desktop, WM, toolset, toolkit(GTK,Qt,..) *packaging format* , etc.. that makes the GNU/Linux system 
[09:26:20] <feep> all of those linux distros also have 99% the same functionality.
[09:27:28] <feep> apt vs rpm vs zypper isn't a difference in functionality really, more one of flavor. for the end user, this is immaterial.
[09:27:38] <bugweiser> Perhaps Guest2297 intends to say: all of these windows editions have 99% the same interface to said functionality... Something linux arguably has significantly less.
[09:27:58] <feep> bugweiser: hm, considering windows 8, I'm not sure this is true either
[09:28:15] <feep> and at this point windows also has a bunch of separate ways to install apps
[09:28:25] <bugweiser> i assum your main point in case is explorer.exe, and I can't do anything but agree.
[09:28:52] <bugweiser> (though to a sysadmin, the relevant direct management methods using registry etc, didn't really change)
[09:29:10] <feep> true true... but sysadmins don't drive market share.
[09:29:24] <feep> and honestly, any linux sysop can use approximately any linux distro.
[09:29:28] <bugweiser> whooooo
[09:29:33] <bugweiser> whooooo
[09:29:34] <Guest2297> Yes,  all of these windows editions have 99% the same interface to said functionality... Something linux arguably has significantly less. The end user knows exactly how the system will look and feel out of the box, not the case for GNU/Linux, and also Windows is preinstalled. 
[09:29:51] <feep> Guest2297: again, windows 8 and 10 are the biggest argument against this view
[09:30:10] <bugweiser> sysadmins *do* get a significant say (in a decent company) in recommending IT upgrades. Corporate use is a big slice..
[09:30:18] <feep> users did end up complaining at length that the system didn't look and feel as they expected, but it didn't really affect marketshare
[09:30:21] <Guest2297> Even MacOS ( proprietary UNIX ) has a same look and feel.
[09:30:42] <feep> remember the stink about the office ribbon menu, lol
[09:31:01] <feep> my argument is: since this basically didn't budge windows market share, it must not have been the reason for its market share to begin with.
[09:31:34] <Guest2297> And I am looking at popular versions , win: xp, 7 ,10 ,11, osx all versions
[09:31:58] <feep> xp and 7 look similar, which is why large part of 7 was considered "good" and vista "bad" :p
[09:32:09] <feep> 7 and 8 look dissimilar, which is why people hated 8
[09:32:12] <bugweiser> Guest2297, you are right there, also regarding MAC. But if subject doesn't lead to something, than you are bordering of beating a known ... horse..
[09:32:31] <feep> but 10 doesn't really look all that much like 7, so what happened?
[09:32:39] <feep> honestly, kde 5 looks more like windows 7 than windows 10 does
[09:32:50] <feep> did this bring users to kde 5? mostly no.
[09:33:07] <feep> we conclude that users will gripe but that is all they will do.
[09:33:43] <feep> my standing theory is: users will stay with what is familiar. when pressed, they will switch to what sounds familiar.
[09:33:58] <bugweiser> and i agree there feep, and add, that is good.
[09:34:14] <feep> I mean, it would be better if they actually went and tried out multiple options... :P
[09:34:33] <feep> but that's tantamount to saying "it would be better if they were competent computer users".
[09:34:39] <feep> most people get os upgrades by buying a new pc.
[09:34:54] <Guest2297> Maybe the "look and feel" is bad because of the X windows system. But the bigger problem in GNU/Linux adoption is that it doesn't come preinstalled on ~99.9999% of systems but mac on ~20% and Windows on ~80% .
[09:35:02] <feep> I think the primary driver of windows in 2021 is still that it's sold preinstalled.
[09:35:06] <feep> yeah exactly.
[09:35:28] <bugweiser> a user wants to *use* the computer. Not make the computer work in the first place. GUI (etc.) is a means to an end. Once you master a sufficiently suitable GUI, you can then focus on work.

[09:37:20] <Guest2297> Yes, and most people don't use the "Linux" or he GNU/Linux because of it's free/libre nature, but because of it similarity to the UNIX or being a Unix-Like system.

[09:43:58] <feep> turn it off in the bios
[09:44:03] <bugweiser> ^
[09:44:05] <Guest2297> okk.
[09:44:07] <bugweiser> and enable 'legacy boot'
[09:44:20] <feep> also isn't there a secure boot shim somewhere
[09:44:27] <feep> I never bothered checking
[09:44:59] <bugweiser> :)
[09:45:52] <feep> Guest2297: so yeah, even so, I'm p sure you should be able to boot current versions of linux even on a secure boot enabled system
[09:45:54] <bugweiser> Guest2297, if you are genuinely new to unix-like OS, please just try some live-cd's first..
[09:46:13] <Guest2297> I *hate* the X window system , are there any alternatives on GNU/Linux that are also widely used ?
[09:46:15] <feep> except on arm, on arm ur fukt
[09:46:26] <feep> do you mean you actually hate X or do you hate gnome/unity/kde?
[09:46:39] <bugweiser> if you hate X window, then you are not new to unix..
[09:46:43] <feep> it's a bit odd to hate X, it's kinda like
[09:47:02] <feep> "I hate int 0x80 system calls"
[09:47:24] <feep> like, you have very specific opinions about a very technical detail :P
[09:47:29] <bugweiser> :) thanks, excelent feep!  (I was alreasy bracing myself for a good laugh)
[09:47:43] <Guest2297> Yeah, X window system has a million different window managers, that's the problem. Windows has 1, mac has 1, * has one
[09:47:58] <feep> um, you will not get around the fact that linux gives you a choice :p

[09:48:21] <feep> yeah I remember installing wm addons on xp to get multi desktops

[09:48:58] <bugweiser> that is actually one of the *advantages*, that choice.
[09:49:27] <Guest2297> Yeah, but the GNU/Linux gives you a *choice* to use suckless coreutils, but most use GNU ones shipped with the GNU/Linux system, that's not the case with the desktop environments.

[09:54:56] <Guest2297> because the gnu website title is the "GNU Operating System"
[09:55:33] <feep> yeah I think that's a bit of an overreach
[09:55:47] <bugweiser> feep, isn't there an article on the gnu website explaining that (and this history we briefly recited)?

[09:58:38] <Guest2297> One other thing that I'd like to ask is that the GNU/Linux system stores their library in some other place whereas the BSD systems store it in /lib and also the include files in /usr/include, whereas GNU stores it in /usr/include/x86_64-linux-gnu and libc.so.6 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 (0x00007f9d74c62000)

[10:01:07] <Guest2297> Because of these *choices* , you don't know, will this code work on the next distro or not, and the directory structure is bad.
[10:01:16] <feep> just link to libc.so.6?
[10:01:24] <feep> you shouldn't hardcode paths for dynamic libraries.
[10:01:44] <Guest2297> no, I used the ldd command to figure out the path
[10:01:47] <feep> at any rate, it's no biggie, distros can fix your paths with patchelf
[10:01:54] <feep> ldd tells you the resolved path, not the path in the binary.
[10:02:07] <Guest2297> Because of these *choices* , you don't know, will this code work on the next distro or not.
[10:02:18] <feep> actually, it tells you both
[10:02:34] <feep> if I look at my binaries, they link to "libc.so.6 => /lib64/libc.so.6"
[10:02:38] <feep> meaning you're not dependent on the path
[10:03:10] <feep> that said, there are now lots of ways to ship distro independent packages.
[10:03:25] <Guest2297> anshul:/home/anshul% cd /lib64
[10:03:25] <bugweiser> paths, config-file names, config-line syntax, is in constant flux, That is really annoying Guest2297

[10:03:50] <feep> Guest2297: yes, that's a symlink? what's your point
[10:04:09] <Guest2297> only one file there. no libc.so.6
[10:04:19] <feep> yes, which is *why you should not link to /lib/libc.so.6*
[10:04:28] <feep> but just libc.so.6, and let the dynamic linker figure out the path
[10:05:05] <feep> all the binaries on my system (gentoo) work like that
[10:06:00] <feep> at any rate, if you run into a binary that has this problem, you can fix it yourself with patchelf
[10:06:51] <bugweiser> There has been an effort (dating back to at least 2003 I think) that attempted to try and better unify paths (and achive better environment variables as in win). Also somewhat akin to MAC.
[10:07:13] <bugweiser> the problem is/was: it would require loads of work as people like to hardcode stuff in linux.
[10:07:15] <feep> yeah, open whatshisface
[10:07:33] <feep> FHS?
[10:07:34] <bugweiser> yeah, i forgot the name, but I do think it is still a good project.
[10:07:40] <feep> it is
[10:08:02] <feep> anyway, my point is, this is not a linux issue, this is a "people don't know how to link to dynamic libraries correctly" issue
[10:08:04] <bugweiser> one just *got* to be fair there, windows pretty much never had that particular problem..
[10:08:08] <Guest2297> Also, every distro also has it's own command to get packages, but freebsd has only pkg. They offer you a *choice* to create a new packaging format, that means, if pkg is good, which it is, no one will use others, whereas on GNU/Linux every tutorial has a million different commands to install a specific package.
[10:08:11] <feep> windows had that problem a lot lol
[10:08:15] <feep> msvc dlls
[10:08:27] <feep> this exact problem
[10:08:32] <bugweiser> Even renaming directories critical to the os (when done properly during installation).
[10:08:55] <bugweiser> never had problems with dlls, the 'rules' say an exe starts by searching in the exe's parent folder...
[10:09:07] <bugweiser> did I have mucho competing dll's ... Yes :)
[10:09:20] <feep> there was a time where noobs were making exes for windows, and msvc dlls ended up in system32
[10:09:24] <bugweiser> but that first rule of where to look, is a god-send
[10:09:29] <feep> so it would work on their system, but when shipped, it'd break for some users
[10:09:38] <feep> and not others, ie. those who also happened to have that dll in system312
[10:09:40] <feep> 32*
[10:09:47] <bugweiser> yeah, but thanks to MS's rule, that was fixable!
[10:09:51] <Guest2297> but on most systems there is dominant way of installing something, right?
[10:09:54] <feep> I remember googling dlls from questionable sites to manually drop them in directories
[10:10:05] <bugweiser> also, users would like intantly complain and authour would seek a redist of said dll.
[10:10:08] <feep> people forget how incredibly hacky windows was.
[10:10:32] <bugweiser> but still... users could help themselves buy 'obtaining' the dll, and put in in the parent folder. That really is excelent.
[10:10:44] <feep> yep
[10:10:49] <Guest2297> Atleast in '21 each os except GNU/Linux has a dominant way of installing stuff right. **In 2021**
[10:10:50] <bugweiser> lol, yeah, loads of hacking oppurtunities!!
[10:11:11] <feep> Guest2297: windows doesn't
[10:11:23] <feep> do you download an installer? do you download a msi? do you use the app store?
[10:11:46] <feep> p sure there was some commandline tool too
[10:12:01] <Guest2297> .EXE format is the dominant on Windows, .DMG is on Macintosh, *pkg on *BSD ,...
[10:12:30] <feep> by that standard I might as well say ".sh format is the dominant form on linux"
[10:12:36] <Guest2297> Atleast there are less than 3 and 99% use the.EXE format

[10:13:38] <Guest2297> That doesn't work.
[10:14:04] <bugweiser> Guest2297, just couse it says .exe, doesn't mean it works the same internally. Not by a landslide..
[10:14:15] <Guest2297> The pages have a lot of different install commands, and they may miss some.
[10:14:23] <bugweiser> and the same goes for executable files on linux
[10:14:29] <feep> Guest2297: if on windows you are asked to throw the windows version into the google to figure out the command
[10:14:31] <bugweiser> (and I guess the same for MAC)

[10:17:34] <feep> my point is I think those are equivalent demands
[10:17:35] <Guest2297> so you are saying , you have to tell the version ie. PopOS XX.XX or Debian CODENAME, or whatever, not Debian GNU/Linux CODENAME or Arch GNU/Linux ,... Ie. OS name, vendor name and version, on Mac and Windows only name and version.

[11:22:10] <Guest55> After *so* many years, why is free/libre software not being adopted on the desktop?
[11:22:17] * bugweiser sits and is strapped in, bring it
[11:22:20] <White_Flame> forthnite? did they port it to Forth?
[11:22:29] <psydroid> isn't that a game from Epic Games?
[11:22:35] <White_Flame> Guest55: you mean like WSL?

[11:22:58] <Guest55> no, operating system
[11:23:32] *** Guest55 is now known as TheLinuxGeek
[11:23:49] <psydroid> Android, ChromeOS, iOS and macOS contain a lot of free software
[11:28:58] <bugweiser> Guest2279/Guest5548/Guest55/TheLinuxGeek, might I ask (genuinely curious) to what point your line of questioning is leading?
[11:34:27] <TheLinuxGeek> MacOS darwin kernel is different from MacOS, AOSP the "open source" core of android is different from Android, Android has tivoized executable of the Linux kernel.
[11:35:09] <psydroid> you can't say they don't contain free software
[11:36:03] <TheLinuxGeek> Just because it used to be free software , doesn't mean that it is. A good example of this is the UNIX operating  sysytem. UNIX was free up until  Research Unix v6 but it is a predecessor of Solaris, doesn't mean solaris is free software
[11:36:08] <psydroid> if you want to say "why aren't fully free operating systems being adopted"
[11:36:27] <TheLinuxGeek> yes, >80% free
[11:37:29] <psydroid> I don't know the answer to that, but I think it has more to do with vendor lock-in and network effects than the quality of the software
[11:38:00] <TheLinuxGeek> I mean that it should be free, ie compiled from the same code as available to the people and not be tivoized.
[11:39:32] <TheLinuxGeek> Why?
[11:40:26] <TheLinuxGeek> After so many years, noone is using free software.
[11:40:38] <psydroid> that's what companies selling embedded devices (including phones and tablets) do and it has nothing to do with the freedom and quality of upstream software itself
[11:40:52] <psydroid> everyone is using free software
[11:41:12] <TheLinuxGeek> On the desktop.
[11:41:43] <psydroid> even on the desktop
[11:42:09] <psydroid> if you want to say fully free operating systems and applications, you have a point
[11:42:29] <TheLinuxGeek> desktop free os share is less than 3%.
[11:42:46] <TheLinuxGeek> Will removing copyright help?
[11:42:53] <psydroid> no
[11:43:10] <TheLinuxGeek> how?
[11:43:13] <bugweiser> copyright is part of IP
[11:43:27] <bugweiser> another big one would be patents
[11:43:38] <TheLinuxGeek> yeah, so just remove ip
[11:43:59] <bugweiser> no, make it more workable, account for internet (a new means of publication)
[11:44:14] <bugweiser> both aspects have pro's and cons
[11:44:32] <psydroid> there is already permissively licensed free software (cf. the BSDs) that isn't getting adopted on the desktop either
[11:45:17] <bugweiser> yeah, but bsd wants to try and focus on what they do best, instead of be yet another desktop competitor.
[11:45:24] <bugweiser> in part, they have a point.
[11:45:48] <bugweiser> (select a distro for its purpose as I said earlier)
[11:47:43] <bugweiser> and if they are not trying to be yet another desktop competitor.. bleeding fast 4k display support isn't that high on the agenda.
[11:47:49] <bugweiser> for example.
