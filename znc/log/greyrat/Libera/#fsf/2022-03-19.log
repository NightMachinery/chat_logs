[00:31:14] <jacobk> Maximalist: Snapcraft does distribute nonfree software IIRC, if that's what you were asking.
[00:31:30] <jacobk> https://snapcraft.io/spotify
[00:31:49] <jacobk> "License" - "Proprietary"
[00:33:28] <jacobk> But, if you're careful, you could avoid nonfree software (I installed Snap in order to install Anbox some time ago, and I then installed some other things with Snap, but I plan to move away from it (currently all I have left from Snap is Minetest and Open Surge)).
[00:35:13] <jacobk> Snap is particularly bad though in my opinion because it suggests installing packages in the same way that apt does.
[00:35:25] <potatoxel[m]> https://www.gnuradio.org/
[00:35:25] <potatoxel[m]> Why is gnu radio using github? and linkedin and youtube?
[00:36:28] <jacobk> Like, when I type `aha` in the command line, it suggests running `sudo apt install aha`, and now when I type "spotify", it suggests running `sudo snap install spotify`.
[00:36:39] *** Quits: davisr (~davisr@fsf/staff/davisr) (Remote host closed the connection)
[00:38:27] <jacobk> potatoxel[m]: GitHub can be viewed without proprietary software (and long ago I think you could make an account too, but I'm not sure). IDK about the other links though.
[00:38:53] <potatoxel[m]> but they aren't even stating u can do that
[00:39:19] <potatoxel[m]> gnuradio doesnt seem to follow the rest of the gnu packages
[00:39:26] <potatoxel[m]> their website
[00:40:46] <jacobk> potatoxel[m]: What do you mean by "but they aren't even stating u can do that"? In the case of Github you don't need any custom extensions or anything. Just load the page in any browser that doesn't automatically install any software from pages it connects to.

[00:44:33] <jacobk> I don't know how old GNU Radio is; 10 years ago GitHub might have been a reasonable choice. But strangely the "ABOUT" dropdown requires JavaScript even.
[00:46:08] <potatoxel[m]> possibly so
[00:47:47] <jacobk> I agree that something seems off
[00:49:01] <jacobk> Maybe you could ask in #gnuradio

[07:17:38] <jxself> Free software support for blu-ray is very limited. The DRM is quite different from DVD. Best to avoid.
[07:19:38] <jxself> In-field revocation for example, so your previously-working certificates stop later on merely from inserting a newer blu-ray into the drive. The proprietary software into the drive updates its internal blacklist automatically when reading newer disks. DVDs do not have this.

[08:46:18] <jxself> The programs mentioned in there like mplayer and VLC can output the audio/video to the screen or a file; that makes no difference - It's just a detail when you run that program.
[08:47:38] <jxself> mplayer has -dumpstream for example. And VLC has similar functionality.

I didn't realize that these services had a fundamental incompatibility with gnu systems that went beyond programming interfaces. They are not freedom respecting and gnu is the free world. I was sad when netflix didn't work because i wanted to see movies, and I didn't want people to dismiss linux because it couldn't 
[20:14:42] <qrpnxz> do this, but netflix's product is defective by design, and I should have been hoping instead that no one ran the non-free software steam offers. Stallman is right. It's important people use GNU systems because they are free, or any kind of inconvinience will drive them away.

[23:48:32] <clever> for some things, the linux source has comments actually explaining them

[23:51:14] <clever> craigt: also, i'm not using any file from that directory, that contains the word "Broadcom", so i could just delete them without any noticable effect

[23:54:43] <craigt> clever: Nice.
[23:56:23] <clever> israel_bg_dctram.h: *     Confidential Property of Broadcom Corporation
[23:56:37] <clever> i'm also a bit surprised that such a string would appear in a file broadcom released to the public
[23:56:50] <clever> if its being released to the public, doesnt that imply its not confidential anymore?
[23:58:00] <craigt> clever: I can only go what is in the header of the file. If it was released to the public whoever released it should have updated the header with new licensing or public domain info.
[23:58:21] <clever> exactly
[23:58:49] <clever> either they screwed up by making it public, or they screwed up by not updating the headers
[23:59:27] <craigt> clever: or maybe it was an unauthorized leak.
