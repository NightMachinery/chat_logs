[05:24:56] <rdrg109> [Q] Suppose I have a html file and a js file. I want to execute js in in the html file by using gecko. Is it possible to do this from the command line? I know I can do this by (1) open the HTML file in firefox. (2) Open the console in FIrefox. (3) Paste the code in the console (4) Execute the code. Now I want to know if there's some way to use gecko from the command line.

[21:27:32] <BaronVladimirHar> There's just too many problems with Firefox. It's sitting there as a backup browser these days, that's about it.
[21:27:44] <BaronVladimirHar> It may not even be on my computer in that capacity for too much longer.
[21:27:59] <BaronVladimirHar> They encourage users to have weak security, for example.
[21:28:13] <BaronVladimirHar> Firefox Sync uses your account password and nothing else to bring in your Sync data.
[21:28:31] <BaronVladimirHar> This basically leaves you vulnerable to a The Fappening style attack on your Sync data.
[21:28:51] <BaronVladimirHar> Plus, if someone gets ahold if a bunch of it directly from the server, it's just theirs.
[21:29:29] <BaronVladimirHar> But since Firefox doesn't force you to set up 2FA with an Authenticator program, it's possible in many cases to just sit there guessing passwords for most people's Sync data until something works.
