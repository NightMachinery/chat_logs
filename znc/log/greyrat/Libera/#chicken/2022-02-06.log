[00:14:25] <Bunny351> ASau: you should do "make C_COMPILER=... PLATFORM=mingw PREFIX=<whatever>"
[00:15:05] <Bunny351> alternatively, edit Makefile.mingw, rename it to sth else and run "make -f" on this
[00:15:14] <jcowan> I'm back on windows 10, so I can confirm that Chicken builds and runs there.
[00:15:21] <Bunny351> are you invoking make in a windows shell? (cmd.exe)
[00:15:26] <jcowan> (with Cygwin, that is)
[00:15:52] <Bunny351> ASau: it will require a bit of fiddling, I'm afraid

[00:27:12] <Bunny351> you need a gnu make, like mingw32-make.
[00:27:16] <Bunny351> dammit.
[00:27:48] <Bunny351> but it might work, though
[00:27:49] <ASau> I seem to rememeber you were going to deal with it somehow.
[00:28:06] <ASau> I mean build system.
[00:28:41] * elflng coughs something about writing a build system using a bootstrapped chicken.
[00:29:33] <ASau> One day I sat down to design straightforward build system in Lisp on top of memoization.
[00:29:33] <Bunny351> yeah, one day!
[00:29:50] <ASau> But then I was interrupted by something, and never had the chance since.
[00:30:42] <ASau> Maybe, it will be more fruitful to just record steps and put them into shell script.
[00:30:55] <ASau> Just to make it work in purely sequential way.
[00:32:27] <elflng> the people over at guix have done some interesting work on this
[00:32:40] <elflng> as a sidenote. not relevant to the current discussion but definitely worth looking into.
[00:33:14] <Bunny351> that is how eggs are built, basically, using chicken-do(1)
[00:33:40] <ASau> In theory, build system can be formulated quite straightforwardly this way:
[00:33:57] <ASau> turn each subgoal into memoized function,
[00:34:41] <ASau> that checks existence and timestamps and rebuilds, if "outdated",
[00:34:53] <ASau> calling its subgoals before the primary action.
[00:35:37] <ASau> You just need to lay it down carefully, and implement all those parameters a la template or suffix rules in make.
[00:36:11] <ASau> The hardest thing is "carefully" here.
[00:39:36] <elflng> the hardest thing is the whole bloody mess. 
[00:40:13] <elflng> id say at least 50% of the interviews ive gone on for the past several years have been for large corporations trying to write their own build systems, usually in some form of lisp derivative.
[00:40:39] <elflng> theres an incredibly large and difficult set of problems involved.
