[16:42:55] <gerikson> poor bastard has a court case against him in Germany
[16:43:08] <prussian> rip.
[16:43:13] <gerikson> he wanted to report his opponents to the police for lying in court
[16:43:28] <gerikson> I have repeatedly suggested he seek legal advice, but he cannot afford it
[16:44:06] <gerikson> I mean, to me it sounds as if he received some goods, either didn't pay for it or refused to send it back, and the vendor sued
[16:44:21] <gerikson> but ofc it's all a big conspiracy

[17:01:32] <Geekingfrog> I find these situations really tough. You're talking with people who are obviously not very well mentally, but not equipped to deal with that :/

[17:49:39] <gerikson> good on them
[18:03:47] <prussian> cool, my tea is coming today.
[18:03:55] <prussian> I have no idea how to tea though...
[18:04:24] <prussian> gerikson: well pete boy has to be able to fly to and from his own private island, no?
[18:05:36] <gerikson> prussian: youtube will teach you to tea
[18:06:03] <gerikson> I used to be particular about my tea, now I just use English Breakfast tea bags

[18:31:21] <prussian> that's a good point, I don't have one.
[18:32:10] <prussian> ugh
[18:33:02] <prussian> ngoldbaum: ya but which one should I get...
[18:33:33] <ngoldbaum> i have the bonavita one with a gooseneck
[18:36:12] <prussian> the Stagg EKG one would go with my Clara.
[18:36:19] <prussian> damn. $150
[18:37:33] <prussian> fuck it, I'll just use my generic one with my thermometer.
[18:37:55] <ngoldbaum> yeah you can use a thermometer too it’s just kinda fiddly
[18:38:11] <prussian> my friend told me his Stagg is slow pouring
[18:38:30] <prussian> but it would work well if I ever have the want for pour over I guess.
[18:39:08] <ngoldbaum> i use it mostly for pourover but it works good for tea as well
[18:39:22] <ngoldbaum> tea needs to be bloomed just like coffee

[22:44:38] <manicennui> Pretty impressive AI.
[22:45:46] <gerikson> them Soviets were clever!

[22:48:28] <buttsbot> Solaris (novel) - Wikipedia
[22:49:00] <gerikson> great link ngoldbaum
[22:49:19] <manicennui> So apparently the English print editions are based on a translation from a French translation.
[22:49:32] <manicennui> And Lem didn't like the result.
[22:54:06] <gerikson> ``Even a sober and mentally stable observer would have difficulty understanding the economy of the Polish People’s Republic. ''
[23:02:28] *** Quits: mouseghost (~draco@user/mouseghost) (Quit: mew wew)
[23:16:31] <martian67> lem liked word play
[23:16:38] <martian67> thats notoriously hard to translate
[23:17:22] <martian67> also lem remarked that he liked philip k dick so thats hilarious
[23:17:37] <martian67> hes one of the few american scifi authors he thought wasnt total crap
[23:17:42] <manicennui> Smart AI befriending the enemy.
[23:20:09] <martian67> lem definitely had a point though, a lot of scifi, especially scifi of that era is real bad
[23:21:10] <martian67> its quite annoying too, because scifi definitely doesn't need to suck, but its rare you have a stand out work that isnt just "worn out tropes in space"
[23:22:38] <martian67> star wars might as well be a western (at least the original 3)
[23:23:11] <manicennui> I don't consider Star Wars to be sci-fi.
[23:23:32] <manicennui> And I actually love space westerns.
[23:23:57] <manicennui> I think a lot of these genres are really just aesthetics.
[23:24:16] <manicennui> And maybe a few common tropes.
[23:25:53] <manicennui> We were discussing the fantasy genre recently, and I don't know that I know what the genre is actually about other than certain aesthetics and tropes.
[23:26:28] <manicennui> But I'd consider Star Wars to be fantasy.
[23:26:52] <manicennui> The Jedi are just space wizards.
[23:27:06] <martian67> i dont think scifi needs to be "hard" to be legitimate
[23:27:18] <martian67> although lem definitely wrote what might be considered hard scifi these days
[23:27:24] <manicennui> I don't think "legitimate" is worth discussing.
[23:27:56] <manicennui> The only reason we even have these discussions is because humans are obsessed with pattern matching.
[23:29:01] <manicennui> Whether something is good has nothing to do with how well it fits in any specific genre.
[23:30:19] <martian67> yeah obsessing about genre is slightly silly
[23:30:52] <manicennui> I also appreciate different works for different reasons.
