[00:58:02] <technomancy> if I publish binaries of a programming tool, is it worth keeping arm32 around?
[00:58:25] <technomancy> I assumed arm32 would work on arm64 without shenanigans but apparently it's not an out of the box thing
[00:59:18] <ngoldbaum> do chromebooks or old windows arm machines need arm32?
[00:59:29] <ngoldbaum> not sure where else that would come up for a dev tool
[01:00:30] <manicennui> Is arm32 common for raspberry pis or other hobbyist "embeddded" stuff?
[01:00:31] <technomancy> originally was thinking of raspberry pi
[01:01:07] <technomancy> ah, so apparently you have to go back to the pi 2 to find arm32
[01:01:17] <technomancy> I had a pi 3 that was running arm32 but not for any good reason
[01:01:53] <technomancy> oh, well there's also the zero
[01:02:06] <technomancy> well, whatever. they don't need binaries
[01:02:19] <ngoldbaum> don’t pis lean pretty hard on raspbian to do the packaging and build work for the most part?
[01:02:31] <technomancy> yeah I guess
[01:02:35] <ngoldbaum> iirc compiling things natively on the pi is… slow
[01:02:41] <technomancy> oh, no I just mean like
[01:02:55] <technomancy> you can download a script version of fennel and it'll work if you pull in lua thru apt
[01:03:01] <technomancy> you don't really need a standalone version
[01:03:10] <wezm_> I think Raspberry Pi OS is 32-bit, even on the 64-bit Pis
[01:03:20] <technomancy> oh really? that's shit
[01:03:56] <technomancy> raspbian has always made some pretty sketchy decisions
[01:04:08] <technomancy> oh right, but these days you can just run debian since mainline works
[01:04:15] <technomancy> there's not really a need for raspbian any more iirc

[21:32:13] <mockturtle> [ Succinctness is Power ] - www.paulgraham.com
[21:32:37] <imode> succinct is a quality, not an ultimatum. sorry pg.
[21:32:52] <manicennui> I get not wanting to write a ton of boilerplate, and wanting an "expressive" language, but I've never understood the argument for super succinct code.
[21:33:09] <technomancy> there's really not much of an argument
[21:33:13] <technomancy> "paul graham says it's good"
[21:33:23] <manicennui> He's not the only one though.
[21:33:34] <manicennui> There are a lot of geeks obsessed with typing as little as possible and I don't get it.
[21:33:43] <cb> i never even got what arc was supposed to do better than racket anyways
[21:34:03] <manicennui> If how quickly you can type the code is the limiting factor, you are doing something wrong.
[21:35:39] <ario_> readability and extensability > succintness? atleast when it comes to developing large scale software
[21:36:13] <technomancy> it reads like the kind of argument you would make if you had never worked with other programmers but only maintained your own code
[21:36:13] *** Quits: hub (~hub@user/hub) (Quit: ZNC 1.8.2 - https://znc.in)
[21:36:14] <ario_> i guess you can have readable, extensable and succinct code
[21:36:40] <manicennui> I'd like to be able to understand my own code in a few months too.

[21:37:16] <manicennui> I think there are powerful techniques that can make code both easier to read and shorter.
[21:37:26] <manicennui> But most people seem to just focus on the shorter part.
[21:37:49] <ario_> i find myself having to rewrite code atleast 2x to get both
[21:38:03] <ario_> hard on the first try
[21:38:13] <manicennui> For instance there are often good functional ways to manipulate collections without a lot of intermediate variables.
[21:38:20] <technomancy> people focus on shorter because it's easy to measure and easy to improve
[21:38:41] <manicennui> And there are great ways to do error handling with functional techniques and types.
[21:39:22] <manicennui> It's too bad Rob Pike never experienced any of them.
[21:39:55] <technomancy> it's like looking for your keys under the lamp because that's where the light is good
[21:41:00] <manicennui> PG seems to have learned CL and stopped there.
[21:41:16] <manicennui> And never worked on any software he didn't write.

[22:27:40] <manicennui> Why in the world is someone with 6 years of experience applying to 29 companies?
[22:28:08] <ngoldbaum> shotgun approach

[22:30:26] <kline> also i guess theres value in routinely interviewing to keep your skills and CV up to date
[22:30:43] <kline> maybe something comes along that you realise is a good opportunity even if you werent seriously looking

[22:31:13] <manicennui> They directly applied to 21 companies though.
