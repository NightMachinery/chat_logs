[01:47:06] <thblt> z3t0:  what kind of info?
[01:47:08] <johnjay> jcbjoe2021: type C-h t for the tutorial. also there's like a video on ytube i think

[02:07:27] <viber> this thing is too smart for its own good

[02:08:32] <viber> not sure why this happens only on this particular project (https://github.com/dalek-cryptography/bulletproofs) and not on othe rprojects
[02:08:44] <viber> umaxtu: good point

[08:38:42] <codingquark> $FRIEND got an apple's air tag thing
[08:39:06] <twb> aidalgol: I should also observe I wasn't really enjoying Ori or the bug one
[08:39:30] <twb> codingquark: oh, so she can stalk her boyfriend?
[08:39:51] <codingquark> twb: stalk boyfriend's keys I suppose
[08:40:34] <codingquark> Issue is that a keychain like cover costs a bomb too
[08:41:47] <twb> isn't the allegedly legitimate use case for luggage
[08:42:04] <codingquark> Sure

[08:42:41] <codingquark> I am sure people will use it to find their cars in parking lots at malls etc

[08:48:07] <s-liao> Thanks
[08:48:25] <codingquark> Perhaps, you specifically want to know how to compile the call and not the defun?
[08:49:09] <s-liao> I just want to see the byte code looks like.

[09:07:12] <rnkn> I'd like to be able to add a fake newline at the beginning of several lines
[09:07:26] <rnkn> can do this with overlays, but I'd prefer to do it with text properties
[09:09:03] <rnkn> it can also be done with setting the line-prefix property to a space with :height value, but this makes the line itself double size, which is aesthetically not pleasing, and doesn't work on console emacs
[09:10:49] <rnkn> hmm possible solution.. put a display text property on previous newline, displaying instead as "\n\n"

[14:05:42] <thblt> Well it's true that the ‘you’re…’ feels unbalanced, but that's the way the sentence is constructed.
[14:06:32] <thblt> e3d3: in that context, I think it means forward the TAB key event to the next binding. 
[14:06:47] <thblt> e3d3: It's a bit of a hack in Org that some bindings do different things depending on the point.
[14:07:21] <rnkn> yeh mixing straight quotes with curly quotes is anarchy
[14:07:31] <e3d3> In the sentence "If TAB is used in a place where it does not emulate TAB", are they speaking first about the TAB -key and then the TAB action ?

[14:10:25] <thblt> e3d3: in other words, it's a sort of magic binding. If you press TAB *there*, call org-cycle. Otherwise, do whatever would have happened if TAB wasn't bound to org-cycle.
[14:10:54] <thblt> e3d3: don't let yourself get confused by the word “emulate”, it's more stupid than that.
[14:11:16] <e3d3> that word is precisly what confuses me
[14:12:53] <e3d3> So if I understand right than `emulate tab' means invoke one of the defined TAB-events, not ?

[14:16:00] <thblt> It's a limitation of Emacs that there's no good build-in mechanism for contextual bindings that depend on your location in a buffer.  
[14:16:45] <thblt> Outshine does that in a different, and kinda interesting, way https://github.com/alphapapa/outshine/blob/master/outshine.el#L849
[14:16:48] <pjb> e3d3: the meaning of "to emulate" that is used is is that of "to imitate".
[14:17:29] <pjb> e3d3: this means that org-cycle (usually bound to TAB) will perform the same action as what TAB was previously bound to, in that case.
[14:17:53] <e3d3> pjb: do you mean "to imitate pressing the TAB key" ?
[14:17:59] <pjb> e3d3: granted too, it's not to precise, since it doesn't really imitate anything, it just calls the previous command.
[14:18:06] <pjb> or global binding.
[14:18:10] <thblt> Oushine approach, in a nutshell: if CONDITION holds, call DEF, otherwise temporarily disable MODE, the emit KEY again.
[14:18:14] <thblt> then emit
[14:18:28] <pjb> e3d3: in a way.

[14:36:23] <thblt> Weird, mine doesn't.
[14:37:53] <e3d3> anyway, I have another question; I there a way to discover what the orginal/default keybindings, even for not-activated modes and packages. I want to know this because I want to override keybindings, but have often no idea if other modes/packages will use the key(combination).
[14:38:00] <thblt> org has a visual indent mode, called org-indent-mode.
[14:39:00] <e3d3> thblt: I think about using `org-indent-mode', but first have to learn about all the indentation settings.
[14:39:04] <thblt> e3d3: no. elisp is a dynamic language, you need to run code to get its effects.  To some extent you can read tha code, of course.

[22:37:35] <grym> yaml is a strict superset of json 
[22:37:43] <technomancy> there are several json variants which allow comments tho; those are much better for many uses
[22:37:43] <grym> (ie, with extra bullshit! )
[22:38:01] <grym> none of those are json that any tool i use knows how to read 
[22:38:10] <thblt> But the difference is: there are two different languages. JSON, originally, was used because JS interpreters could parse it natively, so performance; but it was dangerous because parse == eval
[22:38:11] <grym> so they're json-ish things
[22:38:20] <technomancy> tbh if you maintain a json parser and it rejects comments you're making a terrible mistake
[22:38:27] <thblt> *they* are different
[22:38:34] <artefact> js interpreters can still parse it natively, aiui JSON.parse(...) is standardized ecmascript
[22:38:45] <technomancy> obviously you ignore comments
[22:38:52] <technomancy> throwing an error is just being uselessly pedantic
[22:38:58] <thblt> artefact:  yes of course, but they don't *run* it :)

[22:39:26] <grym> by definition it cannot be :P
[22:39:29] <thblt> technomancy: not playing devil's advocate and all that, but can't there be an ambiguous case?
[22:39:29] <artefact> there's so many ways to write comments, you can't expect parsers to "dwim"
[22:39:30] <grym> that's why it's the _spec_
[22:39:56] <artefact> js-style comments would have been a good addition to the spec, though.
[22:40:01] <grym> you are free to have "this thing that's json with comments", but that thing is its own thing 
[22:40:10] <grym> see also: ndjson/jsonlines
[22:40:15] <grym> both of which are also handy, and also not json 
[22:40:28] <technomancy> grym: you can have a parser which supports spec-compliant json and actually-useful json at the same time
[22:40:30] <technomancy> it's not hard

[23:52:42] <hodapp> my brother lived in a house for a bit where they shared responsibility for meals, and he had to cook for: someone with celiac, someone with FODMAP, someone with a severe nut allergy, and a vegan
[23:52:45] <aidalgol> grym: Are bodegas a black america thing?
[23:52:45] <grym> it's a very daunting list of "NO!"

[23:52:48] <grym> aidalgol: no 
[23:53:21] <aidalgol> OK, I didn't think so, but your remark about feeling at home despite being a giant white dude made me wonder.
[23:53:35] <grym> aidalgol: it's a south american immigrant thing 
[23:53:42] <grym> so i'm still standing out
[23:53:45] <aidalgol> ah

[23:54:23] <aidalgol> [insert obnoxious cocaine joke here]
[23:54:24] <grym> there's a distinct NYC version of bodega that is pretty localised

[23:54:45] <aidalgol> I kinda thought "bodega" was just NYC's version of a corner shop.
[23:54:52] <grym> aidalgol: yeah they left colombia because her idiot uncle skimmed off the top and got whacked, and his clean brother had to scram before vengeance came down anyway
[23:55:09] <grym> they are NYC corner shops; they're nearly always run by south american immigrants

[23:55:30] <grym> can do you up a nice bacon egg and cheese, wire money home, or (and i'm dating myself here) buy a wide range of long distance prepaid calling cards 
[23:55:40] <grym> which i don't think is true any more because everyone knows about whatsapp 
[23:56:05] <grym> also, there's very often a cat

[23:56:55] <aidalgol> Calling cards were big here when my family moved here in the early 2000s, and you could mostly only use them in phone booths, which took cards.
[23:56:58] <grym> hodapp: "you get ... roasted broccoli."
[23:57:16] <aidalgol> Where does the word "bodega" come from?
[23:57:34] <hodapp> grym: apparently millet was a staple there.
[23:57:36] <grym> spanish for "storeroom" 
[23:58:05] <bkhl> So similar etymology to "store" then.
[23:58:12] <aidalgol> ah
[23:58:14] <grym> yeah, same role, too :) 
[23:58:37] <aidalgol> grym: Why'd the brother have to scram if he had no involvement?

[23:58:44] <hodapp> ahhh, that
[23:58:48] <grym> aidalgol: "someone in the family is going to bleed"
[23:58:52] <aidalgol> oh...
[23:59:00] <grym> hodapp: yeah that went down like a ton of lead bricks.

[23:59:21] <grym> yich 
[23:59:32] <technomancy> I see that as kind of the textbook "out of touch tech world goof" up there with juicero
[23:59:45] <grym> technomancy: at least juicero was beautiful engineering 
[23:59:50] <aidalgol> grym: The phrase in the UK is "went down like a cup of cold sick".
[23:59:50] <artefact> you
[23:59:53] <grym> totally useless engineering, but well done
