[00:16:22] <guifa> Can someone do some of my $day-job stuff so I can have more fun with Raku? haha  
[00:16:32] * guifa looks at jjmerelo since he could probably do some of it ;-)

[00:30:04] <Skarsnik> Hello, is there a way to know when some code is run? like { say "code run at", $*PHASER} 
[00:30:30] <lizmat> perhaps Trait::Traced is what you're looking for ?
[00:31:11] <Skarsnik> Basicly I want to prevent a routine to be run at compile time
[00:32:15] <lizmat> set a variable at INIT time, and check that in the routine ?
[00:37:13] <Skarsnik> m: sub foo {my $a = 0; INIT {$a = 1}; die "no no compile time" if $a == 0}; foo();
[00:37:14] <camelia> rakudo-moar 6e5c17f1a: OUTPUT: «no no compile time␤  in sub foo at <tmp> line 1␤  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1␤␤»
[00:37:35] <Skarsnik> sad x)
[00:38:33] <Skarsnik> hm nvm
[00:42:16] <Skarsnik> m: sub foo {my $a; INIT {$a = 1}; die "no no compile time" if $a == 0}; foo();
[00:42:17] <camelia> rakudo-moar 3ef09a72e: ( no output )
[00:42:20] <Skarsnik> this work :)
[00:42:24] <Skarsnik> m: sub foo {my $a; INIT {$a = 1}; die "no no compile time" if $a == 0}; BEGIN foo();
[00:42:24] <camelia> rakudo-moar 3ef09a72e: OUTPUT: «Use of uninitialized value of type Any in numeric context␤  in sub foo at <tmp> line 1␤5===SORRY!5=== Error while compiling <tmp>␤An exception occurred while evaluating a BEGIN␤at <tmp>:1␤Exception details:␤  no no compile time␤    i…»
[00:43:17] <Skarsnik> Not sure how to avoid the uninitilized
[00:44:28] <guifa> https://tio.run/##Pc/NCoJAFAXgvU9xkKBV0A@0sVqkUhK4ahPRYqwrDYyOjONC@nkWn8UXMx3T3b3fMIdzM1Ji3TR5ESGWEi8LQFJiEjHldPPePwShWbHF3JB79N3TQAtDQRicMdDSkB96GGllKGcl7IsswBSBp7DxrasNMSXK2V0mGRcEwTSNS/@kirTndthdu8SbiXtwgu3JdKpR5AT95HmXOnzWPCEbPP53aNvjXVdt349ltac6TfMD
[00:44:29] <Skarsnik> ok with ! defined it's better x)
[00:44:39] <guifa> Just add a BEGIN $a = 0;
[00:45:59] <lizmat> m: sub foo { BEGIN my $a = 1; INIT $a = 0; die if $a }; foo
[00:45:59] <camelia> rakudo-moar 3ef09a72e: ( no output )
[00:46:12] <lizmat> m: sub foo { BEGIN my $a = 1; INIT $a = 0; die if $a }; BEGIN foo

[00:46:25] <lizmat> Skarsnik ^^
[00:47:32] <guifa> declaring in a phaser feels like that feels weird to me.  I mean, I know it works and why but still lol

[01:16:44] <lizmat> melezhik: maybe a #raku-news channel would be more appropriate for MyButterfliable ?
[01:19:53] <helloworldflip> are #raku logs still kept around?
[01:22:32] <Skarsnik> Running Comma in a VM is not great xD
[01:22:48] <lizmat> helloworldflip https://logs.liz.nl/raku
[01:25:09] <helloworldflip> lizmat thanks!
[01:30:27] <melezhik> lizmat I don't mind to switch the channel, will people use #raku-news one?
[01:30:59] <lizmat> I don't know... but I think it would be nice to have a channel like #news on irc.perl.org
[01:31:30] <melezhik> yeah, I also like the ide
[01:31:32] <melezhik> idea
[01:31:35] <lizmat> to report on uploads of modules, comments from MyButterfliable , blog posts, messages by the RSC etc
[01:31:42] <melezhik> let's give it a try
[01:32:32] <lizmat> I guess we should set it up so that only some bots can post on it
[01:33:58] <melezhik> yeah

[01:53:52] <Skarsnik> lizmat, the compile time hack does not work when inside a module x)
[01:54:07] <lizmat> huh?
[01:54:33] <lizmat> ah, of course, the BEGIN runs at precompilation
[01:54:38] <lizmat> so it would not set it
[01:55:16] <lizmat> m: sub a { my $running; INIT $running = True; die unless $running }; a

[01:58:40] <lizmat> so your code in the module should not run at compile time of your script ?

[02:04:21] <Skarsnik> is that a precomp bug? or INIT in a module is precompiled? (wot)

[02:18:04] <lizmat> looks like the INIT of the module is running shortly after it has been used
[02:20:44] <lizmat> I guess we need a way to export an INIT block  :-(
[02:22:02] <Skarsnik> But it's a behavior bug or a documentation error ? x)
[02:22:30] <lizmat> well, the documentation is pretty vague
[02:23:44] <Skarsnik> Execution begins
[02:23:44] <Skarsnik>        INIT {...} #  at runtime, as soon as possible, only ever runs once 
[02:23:55] <Skarsnik> In a way it's the runtime of the compilation? xD
[02:24:00] <lizmat> and the end of yet another day comes for yours truly
[02:24:06] <lizmat> will sleep on it&
[02:24:25] <Skarsnik> time to sleep too ~~

[05:31:41] <[Coke]> That module didn't show up when I searched for "URI" on the modules site.
[05:31:52] <[Coke]> (nor is it the one that zef found for me, I don't think)
[05:32:00] <japhb> That's ... suboptimal.
[05:32:54] <[Coke]> 'zef info URI' points at jonathanstowe/URI-Template; maybe it's a partial match?
[05:33:34] <[Coke]> closed mine
[05:34:37] <japhb> [Coke]: Note this mismatch:

[05:34:48] <japhb> The versions don't line up.
[05:35:30] <japhb> I think `zef info` is confused.  But at least when it's installed, it gets the 0.3.3 one.
[05:39:57] <ugexe> i see whats causing that

[23:22:23] <Od1n> hello people
[23:22:51] <Od1n> i need some help to transform this perl line in raku : map /type_(.*)/, qw< foo bar type_min type_max >
[23:28:35] <Od1n> the best i have is gather for qw< foo bar type_min type_max > { take ~$0 if /type_(.*)/ }
[23:30:55] *** Quits: andinus` (andinus@tilde.institute) (Remote host closed the connection)
[23:31:04] <Od1n> better but not as simple as the perl version : map { ~$0 if /type_(.*)/ }, < foo bar type_min type_max > 
[23:31:37] *** Joins: andinus` (andinus@tilde.institute)
[23:42:29] <lizmat> is the match guaranteed ?
[23:42:45] <lizmat> ah, I guess not
[23:43:14] <lizmat> so you'd want the result to be <foo bar min max> ?
[23:43:35] <lizmat> or just <min max>   # my perl is a bit rusty
[23:43:50] <lizmat> Od1n ^^
[23:47:53] <Od1n> lizmat: hi! thanks for replying. there is no guaranty: those are filenames i parse and some data clearly are missing
[23:48:15] <lizmat> so what is your expected result from your example?
[23:50:01] <Od1n> it's so weird i can show you something in perl :)) actually: when you use captures in a list context, perl release the captured parts
[23:50:13] <Od1n> so yes < min max > is expected 
[23:50:43] <Od1n> the real raku code here is : types => (map { ~$0 if /type_(.*)/ }, soft.dir) 
[23:50:47] <Od1n> (for the moment
