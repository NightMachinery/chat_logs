[00:56:33] <The-Compiler> natris1979[m]: happens, hints are mostly a heuristic with today's web
[00:56:58] <The-Compiler> taeaad: userscripts can access $QUTE_HTML, and there's :debug-dump-page which probably should be turned into a :dump-page
[01:00:13] <natris1979[m]> Yeah. I figured. I increasingly feel like the web has been stretched too far beyond is original intentions
[01:43:36] <mornfall> hmmm
[01:43:47] <mornfall> does qb set resource limits anywhere?
[01:43:57] <mornfall> (in the ulimit/setrlimit sense)
[01:44:23] <mornfall> seems i get a segfault when the python process gets to 3GiB
[01:44:33] <mornfall> and python likes to segfault when it runs out of memory
[01:49:54] <mornfall> building some big lists in the same python interpreter seems to work okay (allocates 6G without dying), but if it runs out, it throws MemoryError instead of segv-ing (the latter seems to only happen when shared objects are involved)

[02:04:06] <mornfall> oh dear meâ€¦ there 140 threads at the time of the crash
[02:04:25] <elshize> mornfall: that is many threads
[02:04:37] <elshize> I don't blame it for crashing lol
[02:05:48] <mornfall> anyway, i guess it's not python nor qb at faultâ€¦ the segv happens in * 2    thread 353425     0x00000f682ce4b94e in ?? () from /usr/X11R6/lib/modules/dri/iris_dri.so
[02:06:02] <mornfall> lovely :\
[02:06:36] <mornfall> first thing in the stack that's got a symbol to it is #6  0x00000f692274ee99 in gl::GLApiBase::glTexImage2DFn(unsigned int, int, int, int, int, int, unsigned int, unsigned int, void const*) () from /usr/local/lib/qt5/libQt5WebEngineCore.so.1.0
[02:07:47] <elshize> is that something recurring?
[02:08:11] <elshize> not that I can help, you'll have to wait for someone smarter
[02:10:16] <mornfall> yeah, crashes reliably on session restore
[02:12:19] <elshize> bummer
[02:12:41] <elshize> I mean, good for debugging, bad for you know, browsing
[02:13:24] <natris1979[m]> Anything graphically intensive on that session?
[02:14:47] <mornfall> opening a twitter tab crashed the thing, but i nuked those 2 tabs from the session and it didn't help
[02:15:03] <natris1979[m]> I'm probably not going to be much help either. That kinda thing is pretty outside my wheelhouse
[02:15:05] <mornfall> probably a bug in the gpu driver or somwehere else in the operating system
[02:18:13] <mornfall> i guess i could try restarting X to see if that helps
[02:18:44] <natris1979[m]> yeah, that's my suspicicion. Though I do wonder if there's something in that QtWebEngine function that isn't properly handling some error it gets from the gpu. Like ultimately it's propobably a driver issue, but I doubt it should blow up like that
[02:19:28] <natris1979[m]> that kinda situation sucks because your like "rebooting might fix this, but if it does, I'll never know why"
[02:20:00] <mornfall> i'll run into it again, eventually; it's not the first time this happened
[02:20:25] <mornfall> spamming tabs will usually do it; the bug actually improved my browsing habits quite a bit :p
[02:20:36] <mornfall> i still hate it tho
[02:21:00] <natris1979[m]> although I just saw that you said that function was just the first thing in the stack with a symbol. So ifyou've got some issue in a binary blob driver, well then who the heck knows
[02:21:05] <natris1979[m]> * heck knows?
[02:24:22] <topcat001> It could also be that under memory pressure something is corrupting memory. If that happened then the actual crash will show up at a completely unrelated place, when it finally hits the corruption. Just speculating here.
[02:24:44] <topcat001> Does the crash happen in iris_dri every time?
[02:32:29] <mornfall> there's gigabytes of free ram
[02:33:01] <mornfall> both in the system and in the limit in the process
[02:33:11] <mornfall> the session restores okay after reboot
[02:34:16] <mornfall> i have another machine with the same system and a gpu one generation older (intel 620 vs intel 630) that does not suffer from this
[02:34:51] <topcat001> ok then could be a driver issue.
[02:35:15] <mornfall> well, i have noticed a knob that's been set differently between them, so i'll see if that changes anything; but of course the different hardware cannot be helped
[02:45:25] <elshize> mornfall: is this some kind of fancy intel gpu that requires special drivers? I always thought intel worked with open source drivers
[02:46:56] <mornfall> it's the standard oss intel driver
[02:47:18] <elshize> mornfall: oh, ok

[12:17:50] <pylbrecht> Good morning guys, maybe someone can help me out with this https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser/pull/6855#issuecomment-984327048
[12:26:40] <The-Compiler> pylbrecht: I'm confused why we are using an old pylint version, we should not
[12:28:21] <pylbrecht> The-Compiler: then I would try to use the latest and see if CI is green. Should I do it in the same PR or in a separate one?
[12:28:42] <The-Compiler> lol we're using a >2 year old pylint version and nobody noticed until now? nice
[12:30:55] <The-Compiler> ah it was due to https://github.com/PyCQA/astroid/issues/772
[12:31:20] <The-Compiler> I guess I missed it being fixed...
[12:40:07] <The-Compiler> pylbrecht: as I expected, lots of new checks added in the meantime :D
[12:40:44] <pylbrecht> The-Compiler: that means this isn't just about recompiling requirements, but also fixing many many issues?
[12:41:29] *** Joins: emagex (~user@user/emagex)
[12:41:52] <The-Compiler> pylbrecht: yeah - I'd be happy to do it, unless you feel like doing it, but it can get repetitive
[12:42:18] <The-Compiler> some new checks should probably be suppressed, but others could be genuine
[12:44:05] <pylbrecht> The-Compiler: well, this seems to block the issue I'm currently working on, so if you don't get to it soon, I'm happy to do that. Although I might not be as fast as you.
[12:44:42] <The-Compiler> I should have some time this afternoon if students don't have too many questions
[12:45:03] <The-Compiler> perfect environment for that kind of work actually, can't do stuff requiring too much focus
[12:48:37] <The-Compiler> pylbrecht: I suppose if you want to go on in the meantime, you could remove the <2.5 from misc/requirements/requirements-pylint.txt-raw, run "python3 scripts/dev/recompile_requirements.py pylint", and run pylint in a way it only reports your new warning, nothing else (might need to change the config temporarily)
[12:49:02] <pylbrecht> The-Compiler: sounds great!
[12:49:35] <The-Compiler> (if using tox, make sure to use "tox -e pylint -r" initially so it recreates the env)
[12:50:57] <pylbrecht> thanks for the heads-up!
[12:59:45] <The-Compiler> ok, after skimming through the changelogs, I see a lot of new gems and optional checkers I want to try
[13:00:35] <The-Compiler> thanks for finding this pylbrecht, I had no idea!

[13:31:12] <pylbrecht> yes, at least running `python3.7` works fine (using pyenv). I just checked and the /shims/ directory is in PATH.
[13:59:26] <The-Compiler> pylbrecht: hm. What happens if you run that command there?   python3.7 -m venv /tmp/somedir
[14:01:06] <pylbrecht> unfortunately the same issue: Error: Command '['/tmp/asdfasdfasdf/bin/python3.7', '-Im', 'ensurepip', '--upgrade', '--default-pip']' returned non-zero exit status 1.
[14:01:21] <pylbrecht> maybe something's wrong with my pyenv setup..
[14:03:32] <The-Compiler> pylbrecht: no more output above it? Not the same error, one level deeper now
[14:04:24] <The-Compiler> pylbrecht: could try to run that ensurepip command manually (with the full path to the Python in /tmp there)

[23:33:07] <topcat001> I love the -B (basedir option). Using it to sync my QB state between machines from just one folder.
[23:43:28] <henko> topcat001: via sshfs?
[23:46:18] <topcat001> No plain rsync over ssh. I just run a sync before starting QB and another after.
[23:46:41] <topcat001> It's a little low tech :)
[23:47:08] <topcat001> The actual data is very little so it works ok.
