[01:42:31] <davic> ye
[01:42:49] <snake> you just grab some input, do the thing on the item you got, then start over with the next item

[01:43:01] <davic> This one?
[01:43:11] <davic> Basically built for data processing
[01:43:11] <snake> but i wish i could be powerful and make a lot of money on io bound programming
[01:43:31] <beaky> what is io bound programming
[01:43:42] <davic> snake: Elixir handles streaming nicely
[01:43:49] <snake> beaky, most programs are cpu bound
[01:43:50] <davic> Golang is unbeatable in that though
[01:43:56] <davic> But Golang has shitty language
[01:43:56] <beaky> what about rust
[01:44:00] <snake> to become faster you need to get a beefier cpu
[01:44:14] <snake> or improve time complexity
[01:44:20] <snake> by optimizing the code
[01:44:21] <hassoon> doooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooods
[01:44:31] <snake> but with io bound programs, you are waiting for input
[01:44:36] <davic> snake: I use more memory than cpu
[01:44:43] <snake> it's better to process each input as fast as possible
[01:44:44] <davic> Like 6-8 GB wam
[01:44:48] <davic> 2-4 VCPUs
[01:45:05] <snake> so you go from the input to the output all in one go via pipes kind of
[01:45:16] <snake> well with steps in between too
[01:45:19] <Bco1981> i must admit, i do prefer cat girls... but, i accept korone.
[01:45:41] <beaky> korone's soulmate is a catgirl
[01:45:49] <snake> but basically its like if i write a program, i like to read the lines on the disk into memory, then use each line as a link for example, and get the page and then find some information on that page
[01:45:51] <davic> snake: https://hexdocs.pm/flow/Flow.html#content
[01:45:51] <ImoutoBot> [title] Flow — flow v1.1.0
[01:46:21] <snake> but with io bound, you instead would read 1 line, get the page, find the info, do whatever, then read the next line
[01:46:34] <snake> it is faster for a server for example that is waiting for input

[01:52:03] <Cryowolf> works great, but make sure you buy a window kit. Hornbach sells for 300 but you can get for 150 on amazon

[02:18:52] <Cryowolf> davic, you have no idea how much of a blessing this AC is. Sleeping in a heatwave in the middle of chemo is horrible. Had to do it for a few nights and I had to go to the ER

[02:19:26] <Cryowolf> yes
[02:19:26] <mixfix41> salix
[02:19:36] <davic> Cryowolf: fuck, hope you get better mate
[02:19:40] <Cryowolf> thank you
[02:22:10] <Cryowolf> It's post operative chemotherapy to prevent or at least delay it from coming back. With the type of cancer I have though, it's only more likely to delay it. So I have time to keep watch for it and remove all risks
[02:22:39] <davic> Hope you'll fight it
[02:22:54] <davic>  beaky can provide you with fit girls
[02:22:59] <Cryowolf> Oh I'm not gonna roll over and die, this cancer can fuck off
[02:23:04] <Cryowolf> lol
[02:23:53] <Cryowolf> beaky would throw loli's at me, then after I decline he would succumb to depression over how anyone could reject loli-chan 3000 yr old vampire
[02:24:16] <beaky> fit vampire goth loli
[02:24:20] <davic> That's his worst nightmare
[02:25:36] <Cryowolf> right now though I have no active cancer tumor (as far as can be detected) but I do have cancer cells and small cell clusters that the chemo (and maybe radiation after) is supposed to eliminate. It has eliminated one cluster so far
[02:25:39] <Cryowolf> so far so good
[02:25:47] <Cryowolf> I am cautiously hopeful
[02:26:25] <davic> Chemo wouldn't help that
[02:26:34] <davic> Fit loli goth vampire girls
[02:26:35] <davic> would
[02:26:56] <Cryowolf> the chemotherapy is extremely draining though, I become very fatigued (body and mind.) It affects my brain, my memory, my cognitive state (sometimes my brain works, sometimes it doesn't) and I can go from being wide awake to being sleepy in a few minutes
[02:27:08] <Cryowolf> kinda like narcolepsy except it isn't
[02:27:52] <Cryowolf> my muscles are also weak as hell, I have post-operative pain complication, a navel hernia that makes that worse and is really disgusting cause I can hear food and liquid passing through my small intestine
[02:29:08] <davic> ew
[02:29:12] <davic> Cant imagine it tbh
[02:29:18] <davic> Sounds terrible
[02:29:27] <Cryowolf> I can push it in though
[02:29:31] <Cryowolf> and then put on a girdle
[02:29:35] <Cryowolf> to keep it in
[02:29:48] <davic> the
[02:29:49] <davic> fuck
[02:29:55] <Cryowolf> if I lie down it stays inside and it's still soft so I'm not in any danger but I want surgery for it soon as I can
[02:30:08] <Cryowolf> a small piece of the small intestine gets pushed out through the hernia
[02:30:52] <Cryowolf> this was from back when I had the tumor...Oh I didn't tell you about that. It was 11 kgs and 45cms
[02:31:06] <Cryowolf> in my trunk/abdomen area
[02:31:10] <il> jesus christ
[02:31:15] <il> That's huge
[02:31:26] <Cryowolf> yes...it was awful, I felt horrible
[02:31:28] <il> That's like 1/6th of me
[02:31:45] <davic> Cryowolf: should've sent that as a diet tip to aftonbladet
[02:31:45] <davic> They would've put it in AB Plus
[02:32:00] <davic> "How I lost weight by removing my cancer tumor"
[02:32:13] *** Joins: parkeerw8 (~E25@priyom/parkeerwacht)
[02:32:15] <il> Cryowolf, how come you didn't get treatment sooner?
[02:32:42] <Cryowolf> il, cause it went from 0 to 11kgs in 2 months
[02:32:48] *** Quits: parkeerw8 (~E25@priyom/parkeerwacht) (Client Quit)
[02:32:52] <Cryowolf> that's how aggressive this cancer is
[02:33:11] <Cryowolf> It's nothing short of a miracle it didn't become vascular and mestastesize
[02:33:24] <Cryowolf> by all statistics, I should be dead
[02:33:25] <il> holy crap... man
[02:33:48] <il> Wait, so... this started 2-3 months ago?
[02:34:03] <Cryowolf> I was admitted on 23rd of Dec 2020, got surgery on Jan 26 2021, started chemo April 28th 2021
[02:34:10] <Cryowolf> no this started awhile ago
[02:34:19] <Cryowolf> I've had another surgery for another tumor too, butit was benign
[02:34:24] <il> How come you didn't start chemo earlier?
[02:35:11] <il> I'm guessing you were following doctors' advice, of course, I'm just curious
[02:36:28] <davic> il: prob takes a while until you get a time at the doc
[02:36:35] <davic> Until they notice its cancer I mean
[02:36:47] <hassoon> davic: Son.
[02:37:01] <davic> Cryowolf: also, do you have to travel alike a long time to do the chemo?
[02:37:11] <il> davic, they'd have known it's cancer before operating on it, though
[02:37:13] <davic> I recall the chemo/cancer hospital is like in the middle of fuckign nowhere
[02:37:26] <davic> il: prob ye
[02:37:44] <hassoon> cancer ?
[02:37:54] <il> So I'm more curious about the time between the operation and chemo
[02:38:03] <il> It'd 3 months
[02:38:05] <il> it's*
[02:38:14] <il> That's a decently long amount of time
[02:38:21] <davic> il: I just see it as Swedish waiting period
[02:38:27] <il> What's that
[02:38:41] <hassoon> il: who the heck are you ?
[02:38:49] <davic> I have waited like 2-3 months between each check by the doc of my high blood pressure
[02:39:20] <davic> Which has been "checked by doctor" since January of last year
[02:39:33] <hassoon> davic: what happened ?
[02:39:37] <hassoon> are yu sick ?
[02:39:49] <davic> At least this medicine lets me sleep without a swollen banging foot
[02:39:54] <Cryowolf> il, not like I can give myself chemo...they had to analyze the tumor and find out exactly what they were dealing with and then because of how rare my cancer is (MPNST), they had to form an international team in order to consult and find the best chemo treatment for me
[02:39:59] <davic> hassoon: high blood pressure mate
[02:40:02] <ButterNoodle> il is here

[02:40:58] <hassoon> owwww
[02:41:00] <davic> Cryowolf: expected so, the cancer hospitals are like in the middle of nowhere, all the specialist hospitals are. Stockholm people need to travel by SJ apparently
[02:41:01] <il> Cryowolf, oh damn, so it's incredibly rare
[02:41:02] <ButterNoodle> ButterNoodle is ButterNoodle
[02:41:04] * hassoon falls
[02:41:12] <hassoon> il: ya true, who the heck are you
[02:41:12] <ButterNoodle> hassoon... bud it was a soft fart :|
[02:41:17] <davic> hassoon: got horny by looking at Gentoo
[02:41:23] <il> hassoon, what sort of an answer do you expect lol
[02:41:25] <hassoon> davic: na really, what happened

[02:41:35] <hassoon> il: you're a spy ?
[02:41:41] <il> only in tf2
[02:41:42] <MootPoot> I'm a panty spy
[02:41:42] <Cryowolf> davic, Lund has very good cancer treatment though
[02:41:46] <ButterNoodle> hassoon: he's a manticore
[02:41:50] <ButterNoodle> body snatcher
[02:41:51] <hassoon> lel
[02:42:03] <ButterNoodle> shapeshifter
[02:42:05] <Cryowolf> il, yes. I mean not like extremely exceedingly 1 in a billion rare, but yes very rare
[02:43:16] <ButterNoodle> Cryowolf ur condition makes me want to get a full body scan
[02:43:31] <davic> hassoon: so. On 19th of Decemberf 2019 I traveled to South Korea, on 28th-ish I started coughing a bit, on January 6th I started having trouble to breathe and coughing a lot, on Jan 13 I traveled home and coughed on the plane home and in Finland. When I came home I learned about Covid19, then named SARS V2. No hospital wanted to meet me, I coughed blood and lost my voice and couldn't eat or drink
[02:43:39] <davic> TLDR, I was sick
[02:43:41] <Cryowolf> ButterNoodle, that doesn't work cause each part of the body is best scanned by different methods
[02:43:41] <ButterNoodle> they were doing those for $500 a few years ago... now they dont even price them..
[02:43:48] <davic> After that I had high blood pressure
[02:44:03] <davic> Now im eating some kind of medicine that they give people with pacemakers
[02:44:07] <ButterNoodle> true Cryowolf.. diff densities, and some places you cant see without contrast dies
[02:44:17] <Cryowolf> davic, what's it called?
[02:44:28] <davic> Cryowolf: ivabradin
[02:44:54] <davic> Apotea forced me to take a generic variant so the one I got is Ivabradin Medical Valley
[02:45:22] <Cryowolf> hmm, must be pretty damn high blood pressure to take that
[02:45:23] <ButterNoodle> still.. paying money for some kinda peace of my is comforting if nothing else ig.. I could put money in an offering plate or a shrine if I felt like that worked.. or some kinda fire/rain dance for virility and health
[02:45:28] <ButterNoodle> woah
[02:45:32] <Cryowolf> hope you're doing ok on it though
[02:45:46] <ButterNoodle> need to check my bp...
[02:45:51] <davic> Cryowolf: still feel it, but way less issues with this than the other one I had
[02:45:54] <Cryowolf> ButterNoodle, yes. MRI is useless on the trunk cause you need two contrasts. One to drink and one to inject
[02:46:03] <davic> Cryowolf: I think I had like 160-170
[02:46:12] <davic> Literally could feel my heart banging
[02:46:21] <Cryowolf> damn
[02:46:28] <ButterNoodle> I've made some significant improvements on bp.. was in the 140/90 range and 120/70 after the weight loss
[02:46:52] <ButterNoodle> davic: what was the diastolic ?
[02:46:55] <Cryowolf> my mom had spikes of 180 before she got on her medicine
[02:46:59] <davic> Cryowolf: but got remiss to the best doc in this shit apparently in sweden
[02:47:10] <Cryowolf> 180/140 or something
[02:47:16] <davic> He was like "ye, you shouldn't be in ampolopidin or wtf the names was"
[02:47:23] <davic> And gave me this instead
[02:47:27] <Cryowolf> davic, oh nice
[02:47:29] <ButterNoodle> diastolic of 140??????
[02:47:45] <davic> ButterNoodle: let me log in to 1177
[02:47:46] <davic> And see
[02:47:49] <ButterNoodle> holy shit
[02:47:49] <Cryowolf> I dunno, I can't remember
[02:47:58] <Cryowolf> this was my mom tho
[02:48:01] <Cryowolf> but she's ok now
[02:48:12] <ButterNoodle> glad u got on meds sir
[02:48:20] <davic> Cryowolf: like they checked my blood and shit
[02:48:26] <theholyduck> ButterNoodle:  as i understand it though full body scans are like. not a great idea
[02:48:27] <davic> Didn't have diabetes and so on
[02:48:34] <hassoon> davic: poor you
[02:48:39] <theholyduck> ButterNoodle: cause your body accumulates cruft in general anyway
[02:48:44] <hassoon> do you guys remember 2019 ?
[02:48:47] <ButterNoodle> theholyduck: they arent
[02:48:59] <ButterNoodle> we just talked about that
[02:48:59] <theholyduck> so you do a full scan and odds are theres going to be all sorts of stuff lighting up thats really nothing anyway
[02:49:03] <hassoon> last time we lived a noormal life
[02:49:16] <Cryowolf> il, my chemo was also delayed cause I had to get another surgery for another tumor. But it was only pushed by a week. I recovered fast from the 2nd surgery, it was done by robot assisted surgery. Hi-tech future stuff
[02:49:18] <theholyduck> ButterNoodle: you talked about them being useless. im saying they might be harmful :P
[02:49:24] <ButterNoodle> and I said it was peace of mind like putting money in the offering plate
[02:49:38] <theholyduck> ButterNoodle:  im saying might give you the opposite of peace of mind
[02:49:48] <Cryowolf> I actually recovered in a day. I went home the day after my surgery, most people stay a week ;D
[02:49:50] <ButterNoodle> probably no more harmful than shutting ur junk in the microwave and pressing defrost
[02:50:04] <theholyduck> ButterNoodle: the harm comes in then having to cut adn probe all the various random shit
[02:50:07] <theholyduck> that shows up on them
[02:50:10] <Cryowolf> after my 2nd surgery that is, the first one I could barely move for 3 days
[02:50:30] <theholyduck> ButterNoodle:  atleast this is my understanding
[02:50:40] <davic> Cryowolf, ButterNoodle: I lied, it was 140/100
[02:50:42] <ButterNoodle> yea I dont think I would ever get cut/probed
[02:50:48] <ButterNoodle> for shits and giggles
[02:50:54] <theholyduck> that if you do a full body scan on a bunch of healthy individuals all sorts of weird shit is going to show up almost all of it benign 
[02:50:54] <Urchin[emacs]> !later tell tsunderenoises https://i.redd.it/kftziftgb0b71.png
[02:51:01] <Cryowolf> davic, still hypertension
[02:51:03] <theholyduck> but you cant necesarily tell if it is without then poking it
[02:51:08] <davic> 140/100, 140/100, 139/95
[02:51:32] <ButterNoodle> diagnostically speaking... now if I was in a Vietnamese BDSM dungeon.. cutting and probing is part of the experience
[02:51:32] <davic> Cryowolf: doc gave the diagnose Essentiell hypertoni
[02:51:48] <Cryowolf> il, the 2nd tumor turned out to be benign though
[02:51:59] <Cryowolf> davic, that sounds like what would be the Swedish name for it
[02:52:05] <ButterNoodle> davic: thats not toooooooo terrible.. but glad ur on meds
[02:52:26] <davic> ButterNoodle: prob gonna be smaller on next visit
[02:52:31] <davic> Which is in august
[02:52:53] <davic> Cryowolf: thats like Sweden being the odd country out, creating DAMP
[02:52:58] <davic> No one else used it
[02:53:03] <davic> And then giving up on it
[02:53:04] <Cryowolf> haha....oh yes
[02:53:09] <davic> I got ADHD
[02:53:11] <davic> Or well
[02:53:17] <davic> DAMP as it was called by that time
[02:53:24] <theholyduck> davic: did you call your brother and tell him to set up the redirect?
[02:53:24] <Cryowolf> I remember in school, people would say "har du damp eller?" - "men sluta dampa"
[02:53:32] <davic> theholyduck: nah
[02:53:44] <theholyduck> davic:  do it before theres another netsplit 
[02:53:45] <davic> confact_: just fix the redirect you shit face, or I'll tell mom to come over
[02:53:48] <theholyduck> or irccloud goes down
[02:53:55] <ButterNoodle> I was close to being put on meds for BP.. but my dr is country and said he didnt want to put me on anything, and wanted me to get off my fat ass
[02:54:18] <davic> Cryowolf: yeah, I literally heard that daily. And then at the end I was like "Yeah, I do have that, so what?" And then they just stood there
[02:54:18] <theholyduck> davic: we would need to change a channel mode or make him +o in here so that he can set the forward. or he would have to do the same for us in #anime once its registered
[02:54:27] <ButterNoodle> davic dont give me ADHD.. I already caught it onc.
[02:54:35] <theholyduck> davic: i THINK a netsplit or something happened and confact somehow ended up with the first back in the channel
[02:54:38] <davic> ButterNoodle: its and STD
[02:54:44] <davic> theholyduck: no one cares about the redirect tbh
[02:54:45] <ButterNoodle> woah..
[02:54:48] <davic> Just tell the ircops about it
[02:54:49] <davic> Or smth
[02:54:55] <theholyduck> davic:  we dont need the ircops for that now though
[02:54:57] <theholyduck> we just need confact
[02:54:57] <theholyduck> :D
[02:55:01] <davic> well
[02:55:17] <ButterNoodle> now I'm on the fence.. d. d. davic you can give me ADHD... if u wanna
[02:55:17] <davic> jess: I recall we spoke about this a while ago, is this on the todo?
[02:55:35] <davic> ButterNoodle: sorry, I don't know where you been. Condom only.
[02:55:45] <theholyduck> !later tell confact_  you somehow ended up as +O on #anime. can you get together with me or davic or nanobot or something so we can set up the redirect 
[02:56:00] <theholyduck> davic: i mean the ircops shut down the channel and made it invite only 
[02:56:01] <theholyduck> for a while
[02:56:04] <Cryowolf> davic, it's extremely difficult to have mental disorders taken seriously because they're not "seen" on the outside
[02:56:07] <theholyduck> and it then basicly went down to 0 members
[02:56:18] <davic> Cryowolf: yeah, only time they are seen are the severe ones
[02:56:19] <Cryowolf> so people just say "try harder"
[02:56:22] <theholyduck> and then i dunno what happen and confact is in charge
[02:56:22] <theholyduck> :D
[02:56:22] <ButterNoodle> yea y they do that
[02:56:27] <davic> Cryowolf: yeah, my dad is one of those
[02:56:33] <davic> Its lovely to still hear that to this day
[02:56:52] <Cryowolf> when they tell me "try harder" I ask if they'd tell that to someone in a wheel chair. "Can't walk? Try harder"
[02:57:10] <ButterNoodle> give confact_ 23.5 hrs and then call jess
[02:57:24] <theholyduck> hes going to  need more than that
[02:57:34] *** Quits: snake (~snake@user/snake) (Quit: Namae nado nai, omae to onaji da..)
[02:57:42] <davic> Cryowolf: but yeah. My dad didn't believe in the drugs either
[02:57:44] <davic> For a while
[02:57:44] <theholyduck> he checks irc like once a year
[02:57:49] <theholyduck> hes too busy having sex with his wife or something
[02:57:51] <ButterNoodle> f
[02:57:55] <ButterNoodle> lucky
[02:58:10] <jess> davic: spoke about what
[02:58:15] <ButterNoodle> I'd say he could come have sex w mine if I was into that kinda thing
[02:58:33] <davic> jess: forwarding #anime to ##anime
[02:58:35] <ButterNoodle> hi jess
[02:59:09] <jess> yeah i was going to wasnt i
[02:59:16] <jess> i'll discuss it with other staff again and get back to you
[02:59:32] <davic> theholyduck: seriously, my irl bro confact_ is as hard to contact as contacting the Forsakringskassan
[03:00:00] <davic> jess: no worries, my irl brother just stole the ops there and went anonymous. And only able to respond once every 2 months
[03:00:13] <theholyduck> davic: i dont think he INTENTIONALLY somehow got it
[03:00:18] <ButterNoodle> wat about avonis?
[03:00:25] <theholyduck> im pretty sure he just somehow ended up in charge after the netsplit
[03:00:31] <theholyduck> seeing as the channel was unregistered and derped
[03:00:39] <ButterNoodle> naa I dont think it was intentiona.. I think he had an autojoin on and the chan was unreg
[03:00:53] <theholyduck> ButterNoodle: i meansure but the chan for a while was unreg but +I by one of the ircops
[03:00:56] <davic> theholyduck: nah, I'm thinking he did Quakenet Takeover
[03:01:02] <davic> I'll take him to court
[03:01:06] <theholyduck> after some people in #libera tried to start drama about it
[03:01:26] <theholyduck> i have no idea how it went form being unregistered but +I 
[03:01:30] <theholyduck> to confact being in charge :P 
[03:01:33] <theholyduck> but i THINk a netsplit did it
[03:02:25] <davic> theholyduck: well yeah, I got kicked out after the server reboot shit
[03:02:30] <davic> Due to the +i

[03:04:16] <jess> oops
[03:04:20] <Cryowolf> they decided to hand over the channels to those who owned them previously on freenode right?
[03:04:35] <theholyduck> Cryowolf: for real projects? i think yes
[03:04:44] <theholyduck> for us. more EH 
[03:04:54] <davic> Cryowolf: no, there were a eBay auction and we had to bid on it. I think we won by offering 10 kinder buenos\
[03:04:54] <Cryowolf> They didn't here? I thought they did
[03:05:13] <theholyduck> Cryowolf: we got this because one of the ircops took it from the guy who registered it and then let us make a "bid" for it :P 
[03:05:14] <Cryowolf> hum
[03:05:32] <Cryowolf> that sounds very peculiar
[03:05:34] <theholyduck> Cryowolf: thus why we did the whole unite the ##anime #anime divide from freenode
[03:05:41] <davic> Cryowolf: you missed the live-streamed wrestling over the channel
[03:05:57] <Cryowolf> lol yes
[03:06:04] <Cryowolf> I was just hanging out in otaku
[03:06:08] <theholyduck> Cryowolf:  and the drama over changing founders

[03:07:25] <ButterNoodle> very kawaii
[03:08:01] <theholyduck> so even their long range planes are like. sort of small plane 
[03:08:09] <theholyduck> yeah hes flying tromsø to bergen thats like.
[03:08:11] <davic> theholyduck: well wideroe was owned by sas
[03:08:15] <theholyduck> aa stupid route
[03:08:17] <davic> Until they sold it
[03:08:29] <theholyduck> its not big enough to really warrant a real airline

[03:10:25] <Cryowolf> cause that sounds likes omething he would do
[03:10:33] <davic> But yeah he should create an airline
[03:10:35] <davic> Air X
[03:10:44] <ButterNoodle> didnt he talk about that
[03:10:49] <Cryowolf> davic, nah but I'm pretty good at predicting personality and behavior :P
[03:11:09] <Cryowolf> cause that's something he would totally do
[03:11:15] <davic> yup
[03:12:59] <Cryowolf> flying with vr on however and having a fictional world displayed outside (of your own choiceof theme) would be pretty cool
[03:14:18] <Cryowolf> or augmented reality and having a certain connection between glasses with AR and the glass. So the AR sends an image to the wearer. I mean they're working on tech that can project images into a persons eyes without requiring goggles and "monitors" in them
[03:14:47] <Cryowolf> that's something I'm interested in

[03:54:17] <ButterNoodle> need to get out the plunger
[03:54:45] <ButterNoodle> actually is just the ones on the front of the house.. can reach in there without a ladder
[03:55:06] <Sxem> my toilet only flushes half the time
[03:55:45] <amigojapan> Sxem: maybe the chain inside slipped

[03:56:58] <Roey> that's...what...he...said.......
[03:57:20] <Sxem> im pretty sure its semi clogged deep inside
[03:57:48] <Sxem> i flushed some bleach, but it had no effect
[03:58:16] <Sxem> inside the tank works fine
[03:58:51] <amigojapan> Sxem: there are special chemicals you need to flush to get rid of clogs
[03:59:04] <ButterNoodle> u mean not enough water dumps?
[03:59:15] <ButterNoodle> or water dumps and bowl fills but no woosh
[03:59:20] <Sxem> i have drano but it says dont use in toilets
[03:59:32] <Toadisattva> dump some sodium hydroxide in the potty it'll clear it up real nice
[03:59:36] <ButterNoodle> its ineffective on toilets
[03:59:52] <Toadisattva> that's what most decloggers that actually work use
[03:59:55] <Sxem> yeah the toilet doesnt empty
[04:00:09] <ButterNoodle> mechanical unclogging.. 
[04:00:12] <Sxem> like half the water drains
[04:00:25] <ButterNoodle> get a cheap drain snake
[04:00:27] <Toadisattva> a drain snake is also a very useful tool
[04:00:29] <Sxem> i just keep flushing and eventually it goes down
[04:00:42] <ButterNoodle> u got gigantic poops?
[04:00:43] <Toadisattva> snake out what iy can reach and hit it with the lye for what it can't
[04:00:51] <ButterNoodle> or kids that put toys in the shitter?

[06:54:46] <Poeticode> sheeeeeesh, as the much under 65 would say
[06:57:32] <pteague> our team lead is no longer on our team leaving just me & another guy ... the other guy wisely called in sick today ... our vietnamese contractors are pretty great, but our 3 new local contractors people have been complaining about ... like somebody this morning told me that out of the 3 of them they didn't like 1.5 of them ... i'm like, is that .5 of each?
[06:57:33] <amigojapan> Poeticode: and we are getting it kind of early cause we have underlying conditions, other people are still waiting too receive their tickets from the government, you can't get it without a ticket
[07:00:06] <Poeticode> amigojapan interestinggggg. In my state, you could get a moderna or JJ vaccine without even having an ID
[07:00:41] <Poeticode> just have to call a number, and they set up an appointment. Provide either an email or phone number, so I suppose that limits some people due to technology
[07:00:57] <amigojapan> Poeticode: I think we are getting Pfizer but not 100 precent sure
[07:01:27] <pteague> anyways, QA contacted me today about a problem & they couldn't get a hold of the guy ... i tracked it down, left a comment on the exact line they needed to fix in the pull request (auto email sent) & then slacked them about it ... over an hour later i get yelled at to get in this conference call ... where essentially i have the guy go to the exact line i commented on & just telling him what to type wasn't enough ... i had to type it in chat so he could 
[07:01:27] <pteague> copy/pasta
[07:02:07] <pteague> & then he argued with me that that wasn't the problem & he'd already solved that
[07:03:30] <ButterNoodle> MootPoot: 
[07:03:37] <ButterNoodle> for each loop that shit
[07:03:48] <ButterNoodle> or while loop
[07:03:50] <ButterNoodle> or loop
[07:04:03] <pteague> loop da loop
[07:04:39] <amigojapan> pteague: why leave a comment and not just code it?
[07:05:23] <ButterNoodle> cause he would be doing someone else's job, instead of spoon feeding them the answer
[07:05:29] <ButterNoodle> :P
[07:05:40] <pteague> amigojapan, because it's his story he's trying to complete today ... i'm supposed to be helping them, not solving it for them
[07:05:53] <ButterNoodle> I'm a good manager
[07:06:06] <ButterNoodle> I'd delete it all, and have them start over
[07:06:10] <ButterNoodle> from scratch
[07:06:11] <amigojapan> I see pteague 
[07:06:18] <pteague> i'm not a manager ... i'm just the dev that's been on this project the longest ... the next guy called in sick today

[07:10:04] <amigojapan> pteague: maybe the guy could not code, there are many people like that hired as programmers

[07:12:29] <ButterNoodle> yea I do infrastructure projects.. and they try to keep that shit to 15 min
[07:12:49] <pteague> ButterNoodle, i'm not sure ... we keep talking about seceding ... ;)
[07:12:50] <ButterNoodle> it takes  15 min to talk about all the cock blocking by other infra teams
[07:13:08] <ButterNoodle> thats right.. I'm moving ur way this fall
[07:13:24] <ButterNoodle> dood call teksystems for more on demand devs

[07:15:31] <ButterNoodle> really the infra b2b stuff between logistics and manheim
[07:16:22] <ButterNoodle> kfc is another big one.. I almost took a net ops director job at the parent a few years back
[07:16:31] <pteague> there is so much lingo here i don't know anything anymore ... like this is a company dealing in the auto industry ... why would you call something internal aaa? :facepalm:
[07:16:32] <ButterNoodle> :| dont like food
[07:16:59] <ButterNoodle> internal aaa sounds like an exhentai tag... ngl
[07:17:24] <pteague> triple a ... i always think they're talking about aaa.com ...
[07:17:37] <ButterNoodle> yea where I work now there are so many company specific terms.. I just tellem to show me the diagram..

[07:17:50] <pteague> & then we also had edm ... i'm like, why are we doing electronic dance music? no, that's not what it stands for
[07:18:06] <amigojapan> Poeticode: they finally helped us answer the questioners so I think we will be able to get the vaccine today
[07:18:19] <ButterNoodle> yea edm machines that cut metal with wire right :)
[07:18:29] <ButterNoodle> so many things..
[07:18:45] <pteague> ButterNoodle, nope ... not that either ... it was a 3 letter acronym for something digital media
[07:18:55] <ButterNoodle> lol
[07:19:20] <amigojapan> You need to write out a complicated piece of paper to get the vaccine
[07:19:26] <ButterNoodle> I worked somewhere that had a website that had all their acronyms layed out..
[07:19:27] <pteague> & nobody remembers what it was because they dropped it around the time covid hit

[07:51:31] <ButterNoodle> yep
[07:51:47] <mexen> thanks amigojapan 
[07:52:16] <mexen> I slept fine but feel a bit sore on my shoulder from the shot. Good luck, keep us posted.
[07:52:17] <ButterNoodle> idk if I'm gonna buy a condo/townhome in that area or a house outside of tonw
[07:52:31] <ButterNoodle> depends on the housing market
[07:52:36] <pteague> i'm in frisco ... crazy part of dfw ... i'm maybe 10 minutes from city hall & there's a giant cow farm down the street from me ... also have the mega shopping strip all the way down to plano
[07:52:38] <mexen> I will grab a shower and check in 30 - 1 hour
[07:53:15] <amigojapan> mexen: which one did you get again?
[07:53:23] <ButterNoodle> I thought about frisco too.. basically just need to be 30-45 min from plano
[07:53:27] <mexen> astrazeneca
[07:53:45] <pteague> ButterNoodle, it's bonkers ... i got mine $10k under asking last summer ... coworker paid asking price last fall ... another friend just had to pay about $10k over asking a couple months ago
[07:53:56] <ButterNoodle> but to get that cheap land u gotta be an hour outside of town
[07:54:14] <ButterNoodle> yea.. best offer over asking price... no thanks
[07:54:40] <ButterNoodle> I'll rent til the housing market crashes again
[07:54:48] <amigojapan> mexen: I think I am getting Pfizer but I am not one hundred percent sure
[07:55:59] <pteague> ButterNoodle, granted, the 1 that paid asking price is over in flower mound & the 1 $10k over is up in McKinney ... might be able to find something, but with the blackrock or blackstone buying stuff at $500k+ over asking ... who knows, maybe you'll find a steal?
[07:57:14] <ButterNoodle> ik.. yea mckinney has a lot of corp offices
[07:57:17] <ButterNoodle> $$$
[07:57:25] <pteague> plano is pretty large ... there's a bunch of other places around & i just know about my friends' efforts ... maybe by the time you're looking nobody will want a house anymore
[08:02:30] <ButterNoodle> tru tru.. stuff is staying on the market a little longer.. just not anything I want

[09:46:24] <JesseDesu> pteague what bicycle is it
[09:46:26] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: like is it more the TIME when it's still hot, seasonally, or is it more the HEAT that is still around despite it being late in the summer or technically fall

[09:48:10] <TsundereNoises> make sure to oil your bike up before you ride her
[09:48:22] <JesseDesu> third bike is a JK runaway that wants you to take her in

[09:51:52] <pteague> JesseDesu, it's an old... 20 speed mountain bike i think? family friends were trying to sell it at a garage sale & i was planning to make an offer at the very end, but i missed it & they were about to donate it ... they gave it to me for free ... i had to pay about $80-100 to fix a couple things including chain, chain guard, & the entire ball bearings area around the peddles ... now it's been about 15 years since i've ridden it & the tubes that were 
[09:51:52] <pteague> already having problems holding air for weeks/months are down to days, the outer tire portion is peeling, i need the oil gunk build up removed & re-oiled ... breaks checked, but there seems to still be a large amount of pad (but maybe it goes bad?)
[09:52:39] <JesseDesu> pteague is money a problem
[09:52:53] <JesseDesu> you can dump $$$$ into bikes, it never ends
[09:53:28] <JesseDesu> i have 2 bicycles
[09:53:35] <JesseDesu> i never use them anymore
[09:53:57] <JesseDesu> i'll give it to you for free just pay shipping
[09:54:11] <JesseDesu> unless ur in hawaii
[09:54:20] <pteague> JesseDesu, depends ... long term, not really, but short term i'm looking at some other investments ... plus i'd rather fix than put it in a landfill & spend $2k on some new junk bike i won't use

[10:02:28] <TsundereNoises> yeah the 3 year olds I've met would not be coordinated enough
[10:02:32] <pteague> i.e. like he was batting the ball with the stick ... but his hand/eye coordination isn't there yet ... best he did out of about 40 tries was he hit it with his hand once ... the "ball" is an old orange practice tennis ball ... i may get him a wiffle ball t-ball thing

[10:05:34] <pteague> but most of it he's still wanting to play cars, but then i'll notice he's stopped doing anything because he's watching a boring part of the race & i'm like wtf ... but who are we to judge 3 yr old racing junkies? XD

[10:10:16] <pteague> these last 2 days have been like 2 weeks ... i only have 2 possible explanations for this ... all the bs that happened today ... & the fact that we had 3 more boys over for a sleep over all around 3-4 years old & i wasn't warned that it was going to happen ... i was like wtf, i could have organized this chaos & it wouldn't have been a hurricane 5 ... maybe only a 3

[10:20:12] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: seems only evil ones

[10:20:40] <TsundereNoises> no i care about cute girls

[10:21:24] <TsundereNoises> the day I don't care about cute girls is the day you know I've experienced personality death
[10:21:26] <amigojapan> We need a strong Pfizer gijinka
[10:22:01] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: but gijinkas are usually cute girls
[10:22:27] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: yes but that's cancelled out by the corporateness
[10:22:48] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: actually I'm surprised it doesn't get your "capitalism is ruining everything" senses tingling

[10:23:44] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: that is what spoonm says of me. I am more against consumerism
[10:25:03] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: so you hate consumerism but love giant corporations?

[12:46:21] <Cryowolf> well...what?
[12:49:27] <il> Your chemo was delayed because of the operation on the second tumor, but it turned out benign and you recovered fast which meant you only delayed chemo by a week.

[12:49:44] <Cryowolf> ah yes
[12:51:08] <Cryowolf> Everyone (including me) were surprised at my recovery. The drain tube they had in my lung sack didn't catch any air leaking and at the end of my post-operative recovery (that special area they have) I only drained about 60ml fluid which was 1/10th of what was expected

[16:32:30] <Sadale> amigojapan, That's kowai. I've pinged adbenitez and hasn't receive a response from him yet. I've found on news that the government there had cutoff internet access for stopping protests there,.
[16:32:35] <Sadale> amigojapan, oh congratz. First shot?
[16:33:39] <amigojapan> Yeah first shot. My second shot is on August 4rth.i hope he is on! Adbenitez!
[16:33:52] <amigojapan> I hope he is ok
[16:35:14] <amigojapan> Sadale: me and tomako got it as soon as possible and we both have underlying conditions. So most people will take much longer
[16:36:22] <Sadale> I see.
[16:38:47] <amigojapan> Sadale: we both have a little bit sore arm but that is normal. But I have back pain and neck pain. But tomako does not think that is a side effect
[16:39:05] <Sadale> amigojapan, My imouto and I had sore arm as well.
[16:39:15] <amigojapan> I see
[16:39:37] <Sadale> For me it's just I've recovered on the third day. So day 1 is the day that I took the shot. day 2 is still a bit painful. day 3 is mostly resolved.

[18:23:50] <davic> Got some fever and headache for dose 2
[18:23:53] <TsundereNoises> I could move, it was just sore like after doing too much exercise or something
[18:23:56] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: nice. I got tomorrow off
[18:24:05] <davic> TsundereNoises: when did you have ti?
[18:24:29] <TsundereNoises> after the 2nd dose I felt mildly sick (headache, light fever) about 18 hours later for around 8 hours
[18:24:29] <MootPoot> amigojapan:  if I wanted to I could just script it in powershell as well but I'm avoiding that on purpose
[18:24:50] <davic> TsundereNoises: samesies
[18:24:52] <TsundereNoises> davic: 1st shot at start of May, 2nd at start of June
[18:24:59] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: I am glad you can take a shower after this. Unlike the flu vaccine
[18:25:13] <davic> Dose 2 was just a bit annoying worked half day and then worked the day after to finish he day off
[18:25:22] <davic> Dose 1 was fine
[18:25:45] <TsundereNoises> the 2nd one was weird because usually I don't have those symptoms without other parts of being sick like a runny nose or whatever, it was weird
[18:25:47] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: my second shot will be August 4rth
[18:26:09] <davic> TsundereNoises: I had like cold sweats
[18:26:28] <TsundereNoises> yeah I wasn't that bad, more just general feeling shitty in the way you do when you're coming down with a cold for me
[18:26:46] <TsundereNoises> worse than the start of a cold, more like the bad part of the cold, but without the other cold symptoms that normally stand out more
[18:27:08] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: I don't think I will tell tomako that the second is worse than the first
[18:27:30] <TsundereNoises> I guess my temperature regulation got a bit fucked up, but I wasn't like shivering or cold sweating or anything, I just had on a sweatshirt when apparently it was normal room temp
[18:27:42] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: yeah, just let her find out later
[18:27:47] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: it's not THAT bad
[18:27:58] <amigojapan> Alright
[18:28:02] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: like it's better than getting covid, especially for someone like Tomako
[18:28:32] <amigojapan> Yep TsundereNoises but if I get her worried she may not get it
[18:28:40] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: okay I'm done with vaccine talk after this, but I also wanted to throw out that current statistics on infection after vaccination are fucked and doesn't seem like there even ARE good stats
[18:29:09] <MootPoot> TsundereNoises:  am I safe
[18:29:13] <amigojapan> I see TsundereNoises . Thanks
[18:29:20] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: because apparently the way it's documented is people admitted to hospitals who then test positive, but that includes people who are admitted to a hospital for SOMETHING ELSE, get a covid test, and it's positive despite a vaccine
[18:29:24] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: even if no covid symptoms
[18:29:26] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: why news about Coco?
[18:29:29] <Bco1981> !later tell theholyduck i just noticed the AC has a led for when it needs to be drained. And the outdoor unit didn't sound like it was splashing water around so i guess it's just codenstation that it makes.
[18:29:32] <TsundereNoises> so the stats right now are basically meaningless

[19:08:17] <TsundereNoises> Bco1981: the korone slippers are a great touch
[19:08:46] <amigojapan> I see TsundereNoises the last one was with the same people on chess. Com but it was filmed and shown in the podcast
[19:09:25] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: It can't all have been, these are promotional for chess.com (which advertises so much it drives me crazy)
[19:09:45] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: a bit of pain in the arm, a bit of pain in the joints, but it seems that's normal
[19:09:49] <TsundereNoises> lichess is the better open source option, so obviously they don't have an advertising budget
[19:10:06] <TsundereNoises> and chesscom seems to be going really hard to own the market via massive advertising and sponsorship
[19:10:51] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: I could link you. Tho if you watch the podcast I think you would be more interested in the episode where Cali was guest
[19:11:01] <DunceCotus> amigojapan I see
[19:11:17] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: I assume the videos go around, like Ollie has her lessons on her channel, but also some of it ends up on the professional chess player coach channels, and some on chesscom
[19:11:35] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: I'm not saying it wasn't on that channel, I'm saying it wasn't ALL on that channel
[19:11:41] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: also I don't care, don't bother finding a link
[19:11:59] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: and yeah, if I was going to watch, I'd watch the calli episode
[19:12:00] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: yeah. They had redacted the whole townsmen to one episode
[19:12:18] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: random aside: I'm also vaguely annoyed by the idea of "watching" a podcast, but that's neither here nor there
[19:12:50] <TsundereNoises> townsmen?
[19:13:19] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: the term "podcast"has come to mean a very brief thing
[19:13:36] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: it annoys me because podcasts are something I love and listen to a lot
[19:13:50] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: but it's getting increasingly hard, when you find a "podcast" to actually get an mp3 you can download
[19:13:52] <TsundereNoises> which is obnoxious
[19:14:09] <TsundereNoises> even some that are audio only make it a pain (or impossible) to get an mp3 of the audio
[19:14:31] <TsundereNoises> also podcasts aren't brief, plenty are around an hour
[19:14:41] <TsundereNoises> I feel like 30-60 min is probably the average?

[19:51:46] <Bco1981> must be very expensive tech in them
[19:52:03] <amigojapan> Maybe
[19:52:10] <MootPoot> I doubt it
[19:52:26] <MootPoot> I feel like the actual reason is that the particulat style of AC unit is rare
[19:52:36] <MootPoot> split portable / ground unit
[19:52:59] <MootPoot> I paid 300 dollars more for my portable AC just so that I could get one with a dual hose
[19:52:59] <amigojapan> MootPoot: no I am taking about thermal cameras
[19:53:28] <MootPoot> oh
[19:53:36] <MootPoot> yeah those have been getting cheaper over the years
[19:53:56] <MootPoot> I think the big reason why they've stopped is because there is little to no incentive to make them any cheaper then they already are
[19:53:58] <amigojapan> But still quite expresive
[19:54:04] <MootPoot> no, not really
[19:54:15] <MootPoot> for what is a industrial tool, 200-300 bucks is dirt chep
[19:54:44] <MootPoot> A headlamp for miners costs like 300 USD or so
[19:54:45] <amigojapan> Maybe they will come with a future smartphone
[19:54:59] <MootPoot> even though its just a LED light with a battery
[19:55:05] <MootPoot> amigojapan:  there already is one

[20:08:08] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: but why do you need a thermal camera to do that?
[20:08:26] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: you don't know to not put hot electronics on flamable things unless you have a thermal camera to measure how hot?
[20:08:48] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: generally anything that feels hot to the touch I don't put on anything flamable
[20:08:50] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: well when the firemen came to my house nobody has any clue what the smell was coming from

[20:09:47] <TsundereNoises> that's all I'm saying, I don't think a thermal camera accomplishes anything that "touch it and see if it's hot" doesn't

[21:05:19] <theholyduck> !later tell Bco1981 water will condense on the inside evaporator. becaus as air temperature drops its ability to hold moisture decreases. 
[21:06:15] <Bco1981> but it looks like i haven't activated the dehumid function
[21:06:24] <theholyduck> it still does that
[21:06:31] <theholyduck> the dehumidifier option is essentially using that feature
[21:06:35] <theholyduck> WITHOUT trying too cool the room
[21:07:01] <theholyduck> Bco1981:  all air conditioning naturally dehumidifies the air 
[21:07:27] <Bco1981> then the dehumidifier option is broken, my weather station does not go down in humidity
[21:07:45] <Bco1981> sometimes it has increased.
[21:07:46] <theholyduck> i mean if its cooling your room at all

[21:10:37] <theholyduck> but seeing as you have to leave a window or a door cracked to get that thing out. i asume more humid air just gets in
[21:10:59] <TsundereNoises> yeah if it's really fucking humid you can pull water out of the air and still not really make a difference

[21:11:54] <theholyduck> Bco1981: a ac cant work without condensing water
[21:12:01] <theholyduck> what it DOES with that water on your one. i dunno
[21:12:10] <Bco1981> hm
[21:12:16] <theholyduck> for my indoor now dual hose thing. originally single hose thing
[21:12:20] <TsundereNoises> you can condense water out of the air and still not make any real difference to humidity though
[21:12:20] <theholyduck> it has 2 ways of dealing with the water
[21:12:33] <theholyduck> you can tap it off as its condenses
[21:12:36] <theholyduck> using the top drain
[21:12:42] <TsundereNoises> because there's just enough water in the air and new air coming in is enough to keep it up
[21:12:42] <theholyduck> which i did once to see how much water it pulls...
[21:12:44] <theholyduck> it was a lot :P
[21:12:54] <theholyduck> i filled a 5l water bottle in like a day
[21:13:07] <MootPoot> hmm
[21:13:15] <theholyduck> or. you can have it put the water onto the other side of the heat exchanger
[21:13:17] <MootPoot> fiji water actually tastes different 
[21:13:18] <MootPoot> huh
[21:13:28] <theholyduck> that is dumping heat out the other hose
[21:13:35] <theholyduck> and it picks up all the water and takes it out with the air
[21:13:54] <theholyduck> that way you never really have to do anything about the water 
[21:14:08] <Sxem> surely in a tiny room with door shut and towel under the door you can overcome more humidity

[21:27:09] <TsundereNoises> sxem: I mean I guess but then you're trapped in a tiny room, and what have you really gained?
[21:27:51] <TsundereNoises> Sxem: if you're cooling with AC, jumping through hoops to reduced the humidity of the cool air is pointless, and you'll never pull enough out of the house overall to really matter if it's extremely humid where you live
[21:28:03] <TsundereNoises> cooling is easier than dehumidifying
[21:28:07] <theholyduck> TsundereNoises: i mean it still helps though
[21:28:27] <theholyduck> but its more of a small biproduct than anything else
[21:28:48] <TsundereNoises> theholyduck: I can run the AC all day and it's still extremely humid in my apartment, just cooler
[21:28:54] <TsundereNoises> and it IS pulling plenty of water from the air
[21:28:57] <TsundereNoises> there's just a lot of water
[21:29:11] <theholyduck> i mean yeah you arent going to get DRY air
[21:29:13] <theholyduck> with an AC
[21:29:17] <theholyduck> its just going to be dryer
[21:29:24] <TsundereNoises> taking it from 95% to 94% humidity is not a noteworthy accomplishment
[21:29:48] <theholyduck> TsundereNoises: i mean. i imagine part of that problem is florida houses i imgine are not built all that well tightened or insulated
[21:29:52] <theholyduck> no. passive house stuff
[21:29:52] <theholyduck> :P
[21:29:53] <TsundereNoises> like I'm not saying you don't get water out of the air, obviously you do

[21:33:37] <davic> Literally sitting here in my own sweat

[21:34:27] <theholyduck> the only way central heating really makes sense as far as i know is if you burn stuff 
[21:34:29] <Bco1981> Cryowolf: me too
[21:34:39] <theholyduck> since burning natural gas is a more efficient way of getting heating
[21:34:43] <theholyduck> than turning it into electricity
[21:34:47] <theholyduck> and using that for heat
[21:34:55] <ButterNoodle> theholyduck: spontaneous combustion
[21:35:01] <snake> davic, yeah but i'm learning nodejs. the difference between the two is it's apparently "faster" to just try and read the disk than to check for the existence of a file and then read it
[21:35:02] <theholyduck> i doubt scandinavia is ever going to move to that system
[21:35:04] <ButterNoodle> heats people for the rest of their life
[21:35:27] <theholyduck> i guess in principle with a ground source heat pump system'
[21:35:40] <snake> davic, because i'm still learning , i am reading the docs a lot and also rewriting things to make it look nice to my standards
[21:35:43] <theholyduck> and a big enough unit
[21:35:43] <davic> snake: the way I handle HTTP Importing is that I save the whole map struct I get back from the http client, and send back a if modified since header and the ETag
[21:35:49] <theholyduck> you could have a central heat pump
[21:35:53] <ButterNoodle> like what we call geothermal theholyduck
[21:35:57] <davic> A bit more faster than just checking the cache
[21:36:01] <snake> davic, that sounds more advanced, i am a serious beginner
[21:36:04] <theholyduck> but. its a lot easier i think to just use split units
[21:36:42] <davic> snake: not really tbh, you just have to save the etag and the modified header and then pass it along to the client and then do specific functions depending on the resulting header status code
[21:36:47] <snake> davic, i'm not even familiar with most of those terms
[21:37:06] <davic> snake: 
[21:37:07] <davic> 304 Not Modified (RFC 7232)
[21:37:07] <davic>     Indicates that the resource has not been modified since the version specified by the request headers If-Modified-Since or If-None-Match. In such case, there is no need to retransmit the resource since the client still has a previously-downloaded copy
[21:37:11] <snake> davic, ok well if it's not advanced i am just not familiar
[21:37:25] <ButterNoodle> split units for modern homes would have more investment, but operating costs are minimal
[21:37:43] <theholyduck> ButterNoodle: i dont think so over a central system on a modern house
[21:37:44] <ButterNoodle> I'd rather have a split in every area/zone

[21:40:55] <snake> and callbacks
[21:40:59] <davic> yeah
[21:41:04] <davic> Makes no sense to use it tbh
[21:41:06] <ButterNoodle> when ur actually not, bc ur letting the interior temp diff be too much and the other units have to work harder

[22:11:36] <davic> mexen: I have an idea of making a Plex clone in Elixir
[22:11:40] <davic> Would be so lovely
[22:11:55] <davic> Each plugin would run in a separate process inside of the process
[22:12:01] <davic> And each transcoding as well
[22:12:04] <MootPoot> what is the average programmers ratio of "I have a project idea/completed project"

[22:12:25] <mexen> 6:9

[22:13:45] <davic> mexen: dont feel like its an alpha software
[22:13:50] <davic> Maybe closed alpha
[22:14:04] <davic> Oh shit
[22:14:04] <mexen> maybe now that I am actually paying for a VPS, I will publish some of my stuff

[23:28:09] <MootPoot> I dont buy/use anything on the quest 2 itself

[23:32:56] <theholyduck> i have a quest 2 and i like it
[23:33:04] <theholyduck> ButterNoodle: also i play standalone a bunch
[23:33:06] <theholyduck> its super convenient
[23:33:17] <theholyduck> ButterNoodle: also as a random bonus. because of how high res the screen on the quest is
[23:33:26] <theholyduck> its actually pretty decent for like watching movies and shit on
[23:33:28] <theholyduck> when on the go
[23:33:29] <ButterNoodle> debating on 64/256 if I'm just beatsabering
[23:33:41] <theholyduck> like. much better than a laptop
[23:33:42] <theholyduck> atleast
[23:34:06] <ButterNoodle> yea.. I have power issues on my laptop.. not enough juice on the usb port to power the headset
[23:34:09] <theholyduck> for simple thins like watching movies and stuff. the quest 2 runs at full native resolution. 
[23:34:22] <theholyduck> even standalone
[23:34:29] <theholyduck> its great. 
[23:34:33] <ButterNoodle> I only beatsaber.. maybe some vrchat
[23:34:39] <theholyduck> infact for any simple thing in general
[23:34:45] <theholyduck> its going to look better on standalone
[23:34:48] <theholyduck> than through link
[23:34:52] <theholyduck> because of bandwidth limitations/compression
[23:34:57] <ButterNoodle> yea I wouldnt use link
[23:35:12] <ButterNoodle> I have 2 cv1's for direct connect
[23:35:45] <ButterNoodle> wonder what the tracking limits are...
[23:36:17] <ButterNoodle> *I'll be able to find them :)
[23:36:32] <theholyduck> on quest 2?
[23:36:37] <theholyduck> what limits?
[23:36:42] <ButterNoodle> tracking speed
[23:36:53] <theholyduck> i havent noticed much. 
[23:37:03] <theholyduck> asuming you are in optimal conditions
[23:37:03] <denza242> theholyduck: hello benisduc
[23:37:12] <ButterNoodle> I'm faster than you :3
[23:37:12] <denza242> are you benising today benisduc theholyduck
[23:38:28] <theholyduck> ButterNoodle:  the volume is also suprisingly good due to the quality camera placement
[23:38:58] <theholyduck> say waht you will about FRL/oculus. but their inside out tracking works really well
[23:39:25] <ButterNoodle> I was not impressed w the rift s..
[23:39:31] *** Quits: duds (~duds@gateway/tor-sasl/duds) (Remote host closed the connection)
[23:39:37] <ButterNoodle> the hand tracking was better than 2 sensors on the cv1 for sure..
[23:39:44] <ButterNoodle> the head tracking was shit and jerky
[23:40:00] <ButterNoodle> 4 sensors on the cv1 has been nice..
[23:40:31] <theholyduck> i havent tried the rift s. but i have heard quest is better 
[23:40:39] <ButterNoodle> nice
[23:40:50] <ButterNoodle> I think I will grab the 64gig and give it a go
[23:42:23] <theholyduck> i have the 256 gb and i enjoy having the extra space for media and stuff
[23:42:33] <theholyduck> as i said. its definitly a better method of watching movies than a laptop

[23:43:37] <theholyduck> ButterNoodle: there is a legal way of downgrading beatsaber so you can mod it while you wait for the super lenghty process its taken for the new rewrite of the quest modding tool
[23:43:39] <MootPoot> the pc version is better for almost everything
[23:43:44] <MootPoot> in terms of fidelity
[23:43:52] <theholyduck> MootPoot:  i tried both .its.. eh
[23:43:58] <theholyduck> the pc version has more STUFF in it
[23:44:02] <theholyduck> but because compression
[23:44:06] <theholyduck> the quest version is "clearer"
[23:44:12] <theholyduck> i dont really need the fancy shader effects and stuff
[23:44:16] <MootPoot> you used wifi or wired?
[23:44:20] <theholyduck> ive used both
[23:44:30] <theholyduck> compression is noticable on either even if you bump the bitrate a bit
[23:44:58] <theholyduck> MootPoot:  im not saying its a bad experience or anything
[23:45:11] <theholyduck> just that. the video compression sort of softens the maximum quality impact of rendering on the pc
[23:45:32] <theholyduck> depends on the title ofcourse
[23:45:47] <theholyduck> but. i dont mind the stripped down quest one. and yo ucan still play custom songs on it just fine
[23:45:51] <theholyduck> so. i dont bother
[23:46:11] <theholyduck> when the BMBF rewrite happens i can finally be on the latest version of the game though
