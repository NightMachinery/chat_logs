[02:16:42] <ski> ⌜p₁⌝", where ⌜p₀⌝ and ⌜p₁⌝ are two points in the coordinate system, corresponding to such (coordinate) pairs of numbers
[02:16:56] <ski> hashfunc1fa5 : "in a Partially Ordered Set, any two elements might not be comparable?" -- yes
[02:17:03] <remii> pounce Would the right answer here to be not enough information or should I try to exhaust it?
[02:17:06] <ski> "therefore a Totally Ordered Set is a Partially Ordered Set, but not the other way around?" -- yes
[02:17:38] <pounce> remii: no it's definitely a maximum (i mean you can plug it into a CAS and look) just thinking about how to prove this is the case using your method

[02:18:16] <ski> hashfunc1fa5 : a <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hasse_diagram> is a common way to visualize the order in a partially ordered set
[02:18:43] <ski> hashfunc1fa5 : np
[02:18:45] <remii> pounce It's asking if min or max is attained and if it is, what are the values.

[02:19:58] <ski> hashfunc1fa5 : btw, there's no need to adorn nicknames with sigils like `@', on IRC. simply mention the nickname, in the message. (many IRC clients will highlight/alert the user, if their nickname is mentioned, first thing in a message (if you prefix `@', it's not first), not as many if it's mentioned later)
[02:20:01] <remii> pounce The constrain is on a compact set tho so min or max is guaranteed.
[02:20:11] <ski> besides, `@' already means something else on IRC (channel operator)

[02:22:38] <pounce> remii: which one is it
[02:23:01] <remii> pounce  x^2 + 3y^2 = 1 is the constrain put on the function.
[02:23:12] <pounce> ohh
[02:23:19] <pounce> then you should get a different answer for your extreme points, no?
[02:23:37] <pounce> try it again and you should get 2 answers at least
[02:23:53] <ski> hashfunc1fa5 : btw, there's also a related concept, "linear order". in a linear order, you have ⌜x < y ∨ x = y ∨ x > y⌝. a linear order is a kind of strict order, meaning it uses the "strict/sharp" ordering ⌜<⌝ which is irreflexive, rather than a corresponding "lax/weak" ordering ⌜≤⌝ which is reflexive
[02:25:26] <remii> pounce How do you mean
[02:25:27] <remii> _
[02:26:02] <pounce> you computed your gradient for the cubic, not the ellipse
[02:26:08] <ski> (a lax partial order has reflexivity, anti-symmetry, transitivity. a strict partial order has irreflexivity, asymmetry, transitivity. sometimes one's also considering the relaxation "pre-order" of the former, which just has reflexivity, transitivity, not necessarily anti-symmetry. there are also other useful kinds of ordering, but these are probably the most common ones that one thinks of)

[07:44:19] <ski> that looks wrong

[11:00:41] <greenbagels> remii: your proof supposes that you can find some a_n that is larger than all other a_i
[11:00:58] <greenbagels> let a_i = 1 - 1/i
[11:01:03] <remii> greenbagels Well a set doesn't contain duplicates by definition and |A| >= 2.
[11:01:14] <remii> I see
[11:02:18] <greenbagels> yeah the trickiness of this sup and inf business is really when it comes down to infinite sets
[11:02:57] <remii> So for example my proof wouldn't work on (0,1), right?
[11:06:54] <greenbagels> right
[11:07:31] <greenbagels> another way to state it is that your proof demonstrates that a_n = sup A, so in other words, the sup is an element of your set
[11:07:41] <greenbagels> but this is not true in general (just like in your example of (0,1) )
[11:08:56] <remii> Yep you are right! :)
[11:09:48] <remii> greenbagels Any tips how to proceed then? I could go about and show that inf A = sup A is not possible for a set with at least two elements but dunno if that's optimal?

[11:26:00] <remii> After writing it down again, here is what I came up with. Since a \leq \sup A and \inf A \leq a, we have that \inf A \geq a \leq \sup A. If \inf A = a = \sup A, then A = { a }, which is not possible since |A| \geq 2. Therefore, \inf A < \sup A.

[11:27:13] <remii> Yea sorry
[11:27:18] <greenbagels> thats ok, it happens
[11:27:27] <greenbagels> but yes i agree with this logic, this is sound
[11:27:57] <greenbagels> (i would personally be more explicit on showing why inf = sup implies A is a singleton, since this seems to be one of the earliest exercises with sups in this text)
[11:28:00] <remii> Is there any other way to formulate my conclusion or do it in any other way? "If \inf A = a = \sup A, then A = { a }, which is not possible since |A| \geq 2. Therefore, \inf A < \sup A." how could I have formulated this better?

[11:36:34] <greenbagels> you can always look at division as working on pairs of numbers at a time

[11:36:54] <callq> Sounds good

[11:38:35] <remii> That's what I don't get.

[14:56:14] <bildramer> if you run simulations and you say you're person #2424 out of 10000, yes, there's 90% chance - but you're sometimes 2424 of 10000, sometimes 2424 of 1000000

[15:57:44] <brick> Hello, I am an final year undergraduate CS student. I am currently trying to learn about lattice based cryptography, I find it a very difficult field to enter. Does anyone have a work path to recommend? My background consists of : Abstract Algebra, Linear Algebra, Modern Symmetric and Assymetric Cryptography Schemes, a BIT OF Elliptic Curves and Lattices. Also a good understanding of Security Proofs and Complexity Theory and a BIT of Number Theory (the one
[15:57:44] <brick> that is required to understand most of the modern cryptography) and Singal Processing. My problem is I don't know of a study path to proceed further with Lattices to understand LWE and Ring-LWE
[15:58:06] <river> pythagoras theorem gives us  sin(x)^2 + cos(x)^2 = 1
[15:58:16] <river> so sin(x)^2 = 1 - cos(x)^2
[15:58:26] <river> I guess 1 - cos(x)^2 = (1/2) - (1/2)cos(2x)
[15:58:44] <brick> Any book recommendations for advanced linear algebra?
[15:59:20] <river> https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Double-AngleFormulas.html
[15:59:37] <river> cos(2x) = 2 cos(x)^2 - 1  seems relevant

[16:00:11] <river> that gives:  1/2 - 1/2 cos(2x) = 1/2 - cos(x)^2
[16:00:19] <river> different to what was wanted
[16:01:01] <river> ah we can get it straight away from: 1 - 2 sin(x)^2 = cos(2x)

[17:49:02] <river> but fred is joes friend, fred hears that the game was played, and im not sure the expected number of rounds the game should go to but basically
[17:49:08] <river> with 1 round, 1/1 people are killed

[18:03:58] <bildramer> say each new group is 1000000x the size of the last one, and the chances of a roll are 1/1000000. or say the chances are 999999/1000000, but the group size is 1/1000000th
[18:04:30] <bildramer> I don't think any of that is right
[18:04:31] <river> opps it should be 35/36 not 5/36. now it comes out at 0.9
[18:04:54] <bildramer> you are putting joe in different groups for round 1 and round 2, which is wrong

[18:08:16] <river> wait we can;'t actually even do this
[18:08:20] <bildramer> before the game even starts, where is joe? what happens if the game lasts n long? you can't have joe be in different places for different n
[18:08:25] <river> because we need to know that joe is playing at round n
[18:08:50] <Decker> well just have to do a total head count and he's 1

[18:11:09] <river> E[rounds] = Sum[n=1] n P(n rounds) = Sum[n=1] n (35/36)^(n-1) (1/36) = 36

[18:13:38] <river> now E[total number of players] = Sum[n=1 to inf] (10^n - 1)/9 (35/36)^(n-1) (1/36) = .. divergent!

[18:14:13] <river> this is fundamentally why there's a paradox right? because there is a divergent sum lurking here?
[18:14:33] <river> or maybe I can calcualte E[number of dead players / total number of players]
[18:14:42] <gohlzehn> river: isn't it something like this? https://imgur.com/a/JCr86Xu
[18:14:48] <river> but thats just a probability
[18:15:21] <river> gohlzehn: that's the that proves cos(t)^2 + sin(t)^2 = 1 a different setup will be needed for showing something about cos(2x)
[18:16:16] <gohlzehn> mhhh so how that look like then? can you provide an image that does proof it?
[18:16:30] <gohlzehn> or an image that can visualize it?
[18:17:39] <bildramer> think about bisecting an angle in the unit circle, and similar triangles
[18:17:47] <river> https://youtu.be/0VBQnR2h8XM?t=86
[18:17:59] <river> cos(x+y) = cos(x)cos(y) - sin(x)sin(y)
[18:18:09] <river> it is proved using a geometric setup with various triangles
[18:18:13] <river> put y=x
[18:18:21] <river> cos(2x) = cos(x)^2 - sin(x)^2
[18:18:38] <river> now use cos(t)^2 + sin(t)^2 = 1 to get

As far as I see the rules for the fraction is x != -2 (numerator) and x > 0 (denominator), then if you solve for x I do endup with `x^2 + x - 2 > 0`, factor this gives (x-1)(x+2) so `-2 < x < 1` I guess?

[21:22:16] <Metaleer> Spivak straddles the line between calculus and full-fledged analysis, I guess.
[21:22:34] <somiaj> Yup, it focuses more on the why of calculus vs the how to use it
[21:22:43] <Metaleer> It's a good book, but maybe overkill for someone who just wants operational knowledge.

[21:29:37] <somiaj> gohlzehn: and -sin(2*pi/3) * 2= - (sqrt(3)/2) * 2

[21:32:00] <somiaj> A lot of my students I think would have a better time in calculus if they could better read/understand/use algebra (beyond just the computation part).
[21:32:32] <somiaj> gohlzehn: it is a special angle, most use the unit circle, here I used the special triangle pi/6-pi/3-pi/2 (or 30-60-90) and realized we are in quadrant II

[23:02:41] <whatsupdoc> Hi I was wondering if people could explain the "100 game" to me
[23:03:14] <whatsupdoc> In the "100 game" two players take turns adding, to a running total, any integer from 1 to 10. The player who first causes the running total to reach or exceed 100 wins.

[23:03:30] <river> sounds fun
[23:03:55] <nomagno> First? That's interesting
[23:04:03] <nomagno> I've seen similar games with the first to exceed looses
[23:04:26] <whatsupdoc> Is this game rigged? Is there a forced outcome?
[23:05:32] <whatsupdoc> If you start at 0, what would be the optimal strategy?
[23:05:34] <river> it's not rigged

[23:06:46] <river> if you land on 89 you lose
[23:06:47] <whatsupdoc> If you land on 90 and it's not your turn, you lose
[23:06:59] <river> if you land on 90 it is your turn
[23:07:05] <int-e> It's a finite game and deterministic, and there are no draws, so one of the players has a winning strategy.
[23:07:18] <river> if you land on 79 you lose, 69 you lose, etc.
[23:07:32] <int-e> (And yeah, you can find the strategy by working backwards from 100.)
[23:07:32] <river> every other number you win. so player 1 can easily win
[23:07:38] <int-e> river's missing something though
[23:08:17] *** Quits: esther (~esther@155.254.31.185) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[23:08:32] <whatsupdoc> What is he missing?
[23:08:43] <whatsupdoc> By that reasoning the player that starts always wins
[23:09:10] <whatsupdoc> Because he can choose 9
[23:09:22] <int-e> but 9 is a winning position
[23:10:15] <nomagno> This is the thing, player 2 can add very low numbers then strategically bump the count a lot
[23:10:56] <nomagno> Which means that there has to be some target that player 1 needs to be watching for to avoid unexpected bumps of the count
[23:11:07] <int-e> I do agree that 89 is a lost position btw. The mistakes comes later.
[23:11:30] <int-e> Anyway I'm just trying to tease river into finding the correct solution.
[23:11:35] <whatsupdoc> So you're saying 79 is not a lost position?
[23:12:04] <int-e> Right, it isn't.
[23:12:45] <river> :)
[23:13:25] <whatsupdoc> 79 -> 89
[23:13:30] <nomagno> This is kinda just raw game theory, I'm unsure this is deterministical
[23:13:50] <nomagno> Well, it is deterministical, but not the same way tictactoe is for instance
[23:13:50] <river> yeah 79 is a losing position to be on
[23:14:04] <river>  78 is a winner, since you can just +1, put the opponent in a loser
[23:14:05] <Oni^> https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=Linux-Kernel-C89-To-C11
[23:14:25] <int-e> river: <whatsupdoc> 79 -> 89
[23:14:26] <whatsupdoc> So why doesn't it extend all the way to 9?
[23:14:54] <whatsupdoc> 79 -> 89 and the other guy loses
[23:15:05] <whatsupdoc> Where as 89 -> whatever you want, you still lsoe
[23:15:14] <int-e> Yeah, 79 -> 89 is a winning move.
[23:15:50] <whatsupdoc> Gosh I don't want to think about this anymore lol
[23:16:10] <int-e> you're so close though (collectively)
[23:16:33] <greenbagels> cant you just work backwards from 99 and write out all the winning moves recursively
[23:16:38] <whatsupdoc> I just remembered the inverse of this game which has a forced outcome and wondered if this one also does

[23:16:47] <greenbagels> like "if this position places me in a winning position, i am also in a winning position"
[23:16:58] <whatsupdoc> there's a lot of overlap
[23:18:11] <greenbagels> like 90-99, you win; 89, you lose; 79-88, you can force the next player to 89, so you win, and so on

[23:20:04] <river> whatsupdoc: you can know it has a forced outcome without knowing what the forced outcome is
[23:20:13] <int-e> I'm actually unsure what went wrong, except maybe some carelessness. If you can move to 100, you win; if you can move to 89 you win... what's the next goalpost? It's not 79...

[23:35:03] <whatsupdoc> i wonder if that game also has a strategy
[23:35:08] <int-e> I might throw a computer at this later.
[23:35:42] <int-e> It's still a deterministic game, but the positions become more complicated; in addition to the current number, you also have to track which numbers have been used up.
[23:36:02] <whatsupdoc> yea
[23:36:12] <int-e> So naively you have 100*(2^10)^2 positions instead of 100.
[23:36:55] <int-e> Which is about 100M so computers can deal with it. There may be a clever insight that makes this work on pen&paper but I don't see one right away.
