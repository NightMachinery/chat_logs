[02:31:54] <Fangs> the resident math physics people are having their own convos
[02:32:20] <Fangs> johnkeats6: buster you guys know about chern-weil? is it related to chern-simons
[02:32:21] <Fangs> ?
[02:34:06] <buster> idk (and I've had only the smallest brush with chern-simons)
[02:34:56] <johnkeats6> Fangs, chern-simons is related to the chern class, obtained via curvature stuff, so yes in a way i guess
[02:34:58] <johnkeats6> but idk much either
[02:35:23] <Fangs> I know neither
[02:35:45] <Fangs> I was just wondering why chern-weil only work with real coefficients (or complex I suppose) but not integrally
[02:36:03] <Fangs> even though the classes you produce lands 'integrally'
[02:37:00] <johnkeats6> how would you get integrality, you'd somehow need to have integer-valued differential forms
[02:37:04] <johnkeats6> and that doesn't make any sense
[02:37:36] * buster nods sagely
[02:38:22] <Fangs> well the curvature is a collection of 2-form. and you integrating it over a compact oriented manifold should be thought of as evaluating it as the top homology class or something

[02:39:38] <johnkeats6> well, ok, it's matrix-valued
[02:39:46] <johnkeats6> i thought you were saying something else
[02:39:49] <Fangs> ahhh thats how you prefer it
[02:40:11] <johnkeats6> yeah i mean mathematicians will prefer to say it has values in the endomorphism bundle
[02:40:21] <Fangs> I don
[02:40:23] <Fangs> I don
[02:40:23] <johnkeats6> but yeah in physics all bundles are trivial and so that's just a fancy way of saying a matrix

[02:41:12] <Fangs> I don't think I even have the traditional 'mathematician's' terminology.. Tu just says these are ordinary 2-forms, doubly indexed and antisymmetric iirc.. and you can put it in a matrix
[02:41:49] <Fangs> if you have two charts, your matrix of 2-forms transform as follows: M' = gMg^{-1} for some g in SO(n)
[02:42:17] <Fangs> so if you have a function on matrices that conjugate-invariant, you can glue these along charts to get a global differential form

[02:43:27] <Fangs> good question.. let me open Tu
[02:43:38] <Capso> do you mean the chern class of a bundle is in H^2k(M,Z)?
[02:43:51] <johnkeats6> yes, things like that
[02:44:04] <Fangs> I wanted to say: if you take H^n(M,Z) and think of it as a subset of H^n(M,R), then it lands in the image of this inclusion
[02:44:16] <Fangs> but this is clearly fucking nonsense.. the former has torsion
[02:44:27] <Fangs> Capso: I think that's the correct statement

[02:46:32] <buster> to fulfil my dream of being a dilettante amateur mathematical physicist? not yet
[02:46:52] <Fangs> for example: Hom(A (+) B,C) ~= Hom(A,C) (+) Hom(B,C) in abelian groups (using z-mod notation)..  so apparently this is 'linear'
[02:47:25] <Fangs> all the resources I read seems to take this idea and just assumes you're interested in oo-categeory stuff and stable homotopy theory
[02:47:58] <Fangs> but I'm pretty sure there's a much 'pedestrian' way to talk about this that doesn't involve me spending 3-monts reading on these really fancy oo-category/stable homotopy theory stuff

[07:23:52] <qergle> er, makes both, i meant
[07:24:32] <qergle> so now we know (A+B)'(A'+B')' is always false, now we can re-do the reduction...to make sure we get to 0
[07:28:45] <qergle> demorgan gives it quickly: (A+B)'=A'B', and (A'+B')'=AB
[07:28:51] <cherim> (A+B)'(A'+B')' = (A+B + A'+B')'

[09:48:39] <cherim> I am not sure what are the statistical consequences of that clustering
[09:49:04] <int-e> Me neither. I mean, for all I know this exponent might fluctuate forever, and not have a limit.

[09:50:11] <int-e> Anyway, this improved my confidence in my C++ code a bit :)
[09:50:18] <cherim> I'd conjecture if you repeated in that setting, you'd also not see high precision with the exponents
[09:50:24] <int-e> It's always nice to have more data to compare.
[09:50:58] <cherim> I find it strange that you get more than 0.026 instead of less though
[09:52:28] <cherim> It may be useful to re-derive what the theory gives for coarse-grained density, i.e. the fraction of intervals that have at least one hit
[09:52:58] <int-e> Hmm. Well, I find it hard too imagine that I'm finding too many solutions... that part of the code is not relying on any approximations.
[09:53:37] <int-e> But just as an idea... there'll be some homungous skips in the future, and each of those lowers the exponent for a long time.

[10:07:11] <cherim> I.e. will 0.061 and 0.073 also be both underestimates
[10:09:04] <cherim> When you annotate with x^0.0377794, it connects 520000 and the number that follows?
[10:09:35] <cherim> I.e. it's a local maximum in running density?
[10:10:35] <cherim> If you honestly plot (N, #solutions<=N) for an unbiased sequence of N (like 7^n), how does it look in terms of oscillation amplitude?
[10:11:52] <int-e> Fine. That'll be the last adaptation of the code for now... but here goes: https://int-e.eu/~bf3/tmp/x11.txt and https://int-e.eu/~bf3/tmp/x13.txt

[13:17:48] <cherim> One is easy mode where hopping is done over numbers which have only few nonzero digits in some base
[13:18:49] <cherim> There you need converting logarithms computed as double to different bases, and necessary precision is easily understood
[13:19:00] <int-e> cherim: No, I'm pretty sure it's literally getting stuck, and it's all my own fault.
[13:19:25] <cherim> And hard mode when the number of digits grows too high so you revert to exact representation
[13:19:43] <cherim> Clearly needed for output with O(1) precision as you do it
[13:20:07] <int-e> cherim: The code has dynamic precision handling already (it's really a requirement to make things this fast), but I think it has reached the point where it's switching back to lower precision too early
[13:20:52] <int-e> It's a solvable problem.
[13:21:31] <int-e> But I've pushed things as far as I wanted to already. :P
[13:22:29] <cherim> After I do the daily potion of Cameron-van Lint, I'll go over https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.00832.pdf (which seems to be the recent account) so that I can answer things like "when 0.026 must clearly override"
[13:23:22] <cherim> And then decide whether I'd code an alternative version of 3/5/7/11 climb before reading yours (as people normally do in this area), or just check your sources without that

But I am not sure about the orthogonal array, in this context is it important to stick with n a function of prime numbers?

[14:13:19] <Arcorann> jmorris: I'm fairly sure it's related to how 355/113 is an approximation for pi (and thus 355 is slightly smaller than 113*pi), and hence sin(355) = -sin(355 - 113 * pi) ~ -(355-113*pi)
[14:14:13] <cherim> You get 2.9999999999999999995871 for free (just from 355 being a denominator of a convergent)
[14:14:50] <cherim> But extra digits need Sin[355] be a better correction to that convergent than some random number in [0,1]
[14:15:46] <cherim> The original expression does some cheap squaring the small error to look more impressive, however

[14:16:18] <udevd> nah, it's just the fact that 4cos(x+sin x) + cos(2x +2sinx) has very wide minima (of -3) around every (2n+1)pi
[14:17:16] <udevd> or something like this
[14:17:35] <udevd> and 355 happens to be very close to such a number
[14:18:06] *** Quits: kakuhen (~kakuhen@user/kakuhen) (Quit: Leaving...)
[14:18:20] <udevd> even for x=3 the result is very near -3, within 10⁻¹⁴
[14:18:45] <cherim> The first squaring comes from the double argument, 4Cos[y]+Cos[2y] ~ (Cos[y]+1)^2
[14:19:11] <cherim> The second squaring comes from taking Cos of an approximation to an odd multiple of Pi
[14:19:45] <cherim> So you want 355+Sin[355] to be as close to an odd multiple of Pi as possible
[14:20:08] <cherim> It's close to 113Pi since 355/113 is the convergent

[14:48:24] <aquery> Does anybody have any idea how to prove/contradict this claim?
[14:49:56] <aquery> Played with it for hours on end now. But I think my linear algebra is just too weak for the task.
[14:50:11] <cherim> Is this equivalent to something like AXA=X here?
[14:50:37] <aquery> cherim: how do you mean?
[14:50:44] <cherim> By multiplying with A^{-1} on the left and X on the right. Not sure about your * and '
[14:50:47] *** Joins: oxum (~oxum@122.172.62.99)
[14:51:43] <aquery> oh ok. X^(*) denotes the adjugated transposed of X. X' denotes the adjungate of X.
[14:51:44] <cherim> If yes, then you immediately get that X=(X1 0; 0 X2) for any unitary X1, X2 or such
[14:53:05] <aquery> cherim: yes, this is what I thought too. But I don't know what to do with it
[14:53:27] <cherim> But this is the complete description of X, what else do you want?

[15:41:37] <river> let p = 8*5+1, i = 9 (i^2=-1), then the sets [x,-x,1/x,-1/x,i*x,-i*x,i/x,-i/x] (as x ranges over 1 to p-1) are either redundant or nonredundant based on whether x is a QR, these sets partition the numbers 1 to p-1
[15:42:12] <river> https://paste.debian.net/plain/1207491
[15:42:43] <river> I count there are b=2 redundant sets and a=4 nonredundant sets
[15:42:58] <river> so that contributes 4*b + 8*a = 40 elements, that works out
[15:43:13] <river> I want to calculate a and b without computing and counting
[15:43:56] <river> (lets say p = 8k+1 to be general)
[15:44:13] <river> so I figure since b is all residues and a is all nonresidues we have 8a = (p-1)/2 = 4k => a = k/2,   4b = 4k => b = k
[15:44:17] <river> but this isn't correct

[16:55:58] <mandanguita> Actually I've already proved that is integrable as riemann, I just wanted to make sure that it has no antiderivative
[16:56:46] <mandanguita> but I don't have any premises to conclude that, since the FTC (Barrow's rule) doesn't say anything about non continuity
[16:57:14] <mandanguita> it doesn't say anything at all about existence of antiderivatives, really
[16:57:38] <Z-module> by the way, unrelatedly, while this f is differentiable nowhere, the function g(x) = (f(x))^3  is differentiable on a dense set

[17:04:44] <Z-module> Here's a neat way: Say F' = that f on all of R.  So F is not constant. But if F'(t) != 0, (thus t is rational, now pick any irrational y > t), we have F' nonzero and F'(y) = f(y) = 0, so F' (by the intermediate value property of derivatives) has to assume all real values between F'(t) and 0 on the iunterval [t, y].  THere are uncountably many of those values, but only countably many points (rationals) in there where F' = f is nonzero.

[17:23:15] <Jimmy2027> Hi, I have a question about the KL-divergence of an unknown distribution Q from which I can sample and a standard normal distribution P.
[17:23:17] <Jimmy2027> I guess it does not make sense to simply sample K samples from one distribution and compare them with K samples from the other since they need to be somewhat ordered (the KL-divergence being an integral, the values from both distributions are compared for the same value on the "x-axis").
[17:23:19] <Jimmy2027> So I was wondering, if I were to sample K samples from Q with zi = \mu_Q + \sigma_Q * \epsilon_i with \epsilon_i sampled from P (standard normal gaussian), could I then calculate the KL-divergence by comparing z_i and \epsilon_i?Y

[19:23:00] <cherim> You can go without the mean value for derivatives (Darboux) for non-existence of an antiderivative for the Riemann function I think
[19:23:05] <cherim> Just by https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_theorem_of_calculus#Second_part
[19:23:34] <cherim> It requires Riemann integrability only, and immediately yields that if an antiderivative exists, it's identically zero

[21:29:12] <KatrinValerie> tangentstorm: any specific course to start on?
[21:29:44] <KatrinValerie> and I might need drills for general concentration ability as well
[21:30:41] <tangentstorm> just depends on what you need. it's designed to focus on mastery so if you want you could just start with like kindergarten and take the tests to move past them.

[22:08:06] <XCode> Thanks :D
[22:08:28] <loopspace> Have you finished Vakil? :-)
[22:08:59] <XCode> loopspace: I was working on my paper it was just published yesterday. Though now will go back to it.
[22:09:07] <XCode> I will definitely finish it before my PhD.
[22:09:12] <XCode> have 2 years left.

[23:16:11] <river> category theory question
[23:16:16] <tupui> Any orthogonal array expert here? I don't understand the need of prime numbers here. I read about Galois field and don't get the advantage in practice if I want to make a n-D sampling for numerical integration for instance. Do I get better convergence using a factor of a prime number of sample?
[23:16:17] <river> is -^op a contravariant functor?

[23:21:53] <river> please don't
[23:21:53] <jeslie0> No, I don't think so. op should be a covariant functor from Cat -> Cat, sending X |-> X^op and (F:X -> Y) |-> (F^op : X^op -> Yop).
[23:22:12] <river> oh its from Cat -> Cat

[23:22:55] <river> (F:X -> Y) |-> (F^op : X^op -> Yop).  I don't understand this part though
[23:23:10] <river> wouldn't F^op : Y^op -> X^op?
[23:23:32] <river> or maybe you can't do that and that's why its not a functor
[23:23:39] <jeslie0> You should try to define a functor with that type - I don't think you will get very far though
[23:23:57] <pai-pai> really, it does ot matter. i can, i am able to. foobar
[23:24:19] <pai-pai> so
[23:24:42] <jeslie0> See this nlab link: https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/opposite+category#opposite_functors
[23:24:46] <pai-pai> are yiu able to define intelligence?

[23:25:18] <river> so what is -^op
[23:25:28] <Inline> intelligence in our days is when you are smart in an ill way......
[23:25:29] <river> it's not a functor, but it applies to objects and maps

[23:38:42] <jeslie0> river I haven't actually seen anyone call it a functor before, but I think it should be. We know what it does on objects and maps, but we still need to check the axioms. Identity should be clear and I think associativity holds from associativity of functors

[23:39:13] <jeslie0> river It will be a functor in a higher universe though, since Cat is not an object of Cat.
[23:39:22] <river> yeah the higher one makes sense
[23:39:33] <river> but i think my hope for the objects and maps one to be a functor was wrong
