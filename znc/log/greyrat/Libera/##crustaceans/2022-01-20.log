[00:02:31] <drakonis> its very cl heavy though
[00:02:44] <manicennui> Yeah. I've looked at that sub before.
[00:03:27] <ngoldbaum> it’s ok he’s the architect
[00:03:32] <ngoldbaum> he has the blueprints
[00:03:38] <drakonis> the most common posters are also lisp library authors
[00:04:01] <ngoldbaum> did the city code inspectors verify everything was built to plans?
[00:04:13] <manicennui> ngoldbaum: It doesn't help that he isn't even a long-term employee. He didn't work on these systems for years and then get promoted.
[00:04:26] <manicennui> We hired him as enterprise architect and he has never touched the code.
[00:04:51] <ngoldbaum> ah cool well he should get back to fixing the warp engines on the enterprise
[00:05:31] <imode> you hired geordi laforge?
[00:05:49] <manicennui> He does generally know what he is talking about from a technical perspective, but it is all detached from the actual work.
[00:05:59] <imode> actually it sounds like barclay.
[00:06:28] <manicennui> Fortunately we aren't not required to do what he wants for the most part.
[00:06:35] <ngoldbaum> are we talking season 2 creep geordi or season 6 slightly less offensive geordi
[00:06:45] <manicennui> But he gets involved in various company-wide projects and then people try to push us to use them.
[00:08:16] <imode> season 3-4 geordi.

[00:38:13] <gwozniak> Just got a bug that may let me refactor some part of the code that desperately needs it
[00:38:19] <manicennui> My impression is that Atlassian doesn't do a good job of maintaining it.
[00:38:41] <manicennui> Never became popular enough for them to care about very much.
[00:38:42] <gwozniak> I would be happier with Jenkins

[02:40:37] <skyl4rk> well, windows, and desktop-type linux, and (I guess) mac, to not talk about android, have pretty much tried hiding the filesystem from the user for a while now
[02:47:27] <gerikson> knowing about the filesystem shouldn't be needed
[02:48:03] <gerikson> OneNote, for example, seamlessly and silently saves your progress (with incremental restore) with no fuss or muss
[02:48:17] <gerikson> compare wth Excel, where you can't even fucking email a saved file if it's still open
[02:50:03] <manicennui> How dare you try to touch a file while the mighty Excel has it.
[02:54:11] <skyl4rk> filesystem knowledge - perhaps not, but to me the act of copying/moving files are tightly coupled to the notion that a file has a singular location, soft links are sometimes useful, but it's usually transparent that it is just a link, hard links on the other hand are more advanced
[02:56:24] <skyl4rk> I find it baffling that excel seems to share one undo queue across all open documents, I could probably concieve of a situation where that would come in useful, but as the default?! what the hell!
[03:03:15] <indigo> Wait, even when you have multiple instances of Excel open?
[03:04:06] <skyl4rk> iirc, yes
[03:04:42] <indigo> Heh
[03:04:47] <skyl4rk> unless you consider "multiple instances open" different from "multiple documents open", I'm thinking of the latter.
[03:04:53] <indigo> Man, I haven't even used Excel in forever
[03:05:02] <indigo> I do remember it had its quirks with multiple documents being open
[03:07:00] <skyl4rk> at work it's unfortunately office all the way for document processing, blegh
[03:07:24] <indigo> I don't mind Office
[03:11:56] <manicennui> We use Google's nonsense and it works well enough.
[03:12:04] <manicennui> And it's not something I have to use every day.
[03:12:29] <skyl4rk> too many knobs to twiddle deliberately or by accident, or by office itself; when you remove a list item with elbow shift left delete and suddenly find yourself at a level of indentation not matching anything else in the document. Or when something has been pasted from somewhere else, and for this reason there is half a paragraph with a slightly different font. It becomes quite a hog with

[19:34:31] <companion_cube> god they must hate that
[19:38:33] <prussian> love to hate
[19:38:46] <companion_cube> that could be fox news' slogan
[19:40:51] <manicennui> I stupidly thought that my Mac would be updated this morning if I started it last night before I went to bed.
[19:40:57] <manicennui> It got stuck at the boot login.
[19:41:16] <prussian> seems like the way it is with all these cable news stations. at least back in the day they had stupid shit like cross fire or the Colmes to go with your hannity
[19:41:49] <manicennui> And then it claims that one of the updates couldn't be completed successfully, but won't tell me anything else. I clicked the notification and it took me to software updates again.
[19:42:02] <manicennui> Does appear as though the OS update is no longer listed, so oh well.
[19:42:03] <prussian> lol
[19:42:19] <manicennui> I'm sure I could dig through some logs and figure it out, but fuck it.
[19:42:20] <prussian> linux users win again.
[19:43:20] <prussian> oops.... I missed a meeting.
[19:43:38] <manicennui> Must have been important.
[19:43:54] <prussian> I don't even know what is important anymore.
[19:46:42] <manicennui> That's the great thing: it is up to you.

[19:51:10] <epilys> client complained to me that a debugging task took too much time
[19:51:19] <epilys> should I stop detailing the billed hours?
[19:51:22] <epilys> probably
[19:51:38] <manicennui> You should stop debugging and leave it broken.
[19:51:56] <prussian> epilys: customer will complain billed hours is not descriptive enough.
[19:51:57] <prussian> duh
[19:51:58] <prussian> lel
[19:52:00] <manicennui> Obviously they know better than you, so they can fix it.
[19:52:01] <prussian> you cannot win
[19:52:10] <epilys> They saw the debugging task in the analytical time keeping document I keep
[19:52:57] <epilys> Now I see why it was a bad idea to offer that

[19:56:27] <buttsbot> Steve Bannon learned to harness troll army from 'World of Warcraft'
[19:57:05] <manicennui> Wow. Bannon helped get funding for a Chinese gold farming company.
[19:58:13] <prussian> epilys: idk though. try not detailing them next time you work for these clients.
[19:58:14] <prussian> lol
[19:58:54] <prussian> manicennui: well not surprising. lot of the alt extremist crap is probably all connected some way to those weird chinese people who run Epoch Times.
[19:58:55] <prussian> uh

[20:03:00] <prussian> behind me at my "new office" from home.
[20:05:12] <epilys> your grandpa's huh? is it good?

[20:08:14] <epilys> mm okay. I like the colors a lot and the entire palette choices, but the composition obviously leaves me baffled
[20:08:21] <epilys> I'd keep it for it being colorful

[21:55:09] <gerikson> wtf
[21:55:57] <companion_cube> he's right, movies are done far too cheaply, they should  cost billions
[22:06:33] <manicennui> We should dedicate the entire GDP to one Marvel movie each year.
[22:07:01] <manicennui> Everyone in the country is either in the movie or works on it.
[22:07:31] <ngoldbaum> i preferred it when this was the plot of synecdoche new york
[22:09:30] <imode> GOOOOD MORNING.
[22:09:35] <imode> whoops, capslock was on.
[22:09:43] <imode> pulled a robin williams there.
[22:09:49] <bontaq> I liked it
[22:13:43] <riv> :D
[22:23:18] <manicennui> imode: This is not 'Nam. There are rules.
[22:36:25] <jlindgren> imode: its not a caps lock morning until friday
[22:40:30] <ngoldbaum> it’s kind of impressive how shitty new reddit is
[22:40:42] <ngoldbaum> shit doesn’t load
[22:40:54] <ngoldbaum> change to old.reddit; loads instantly
[22:41:17] <ngoldbaum> how do you fuck up a website that works perfectly fine so badly?
[22:41:44] <imode> that's the point. they want you to use their app.
[22:42:18] <ngoldbaum> but the app has all the same slowness or just complete brokenness
[22:43:29] <riv> I hate websites and apps
[22:44:02] <companion_cube> ngoldbaum: the app can spy on you better
[22:44:17] <edk> i think there's a level of incompetence involved too
[22:44:24] <ngoldbaum> but like, the app is also broken
[22:44:28] <edk> there's no doubt that reddit tries to funnel people into the app
[22:44:44] <edk> but new reddit is awful independently of that
[22:44:46] <ngoldbaum> subreddits don’t load but old.reddit loads the same thing fine
[22:44:46] <companion_cube> SPAs were a mistake
[22:44:50] <edk> yes
[22:44:55] <companion_cube> old.reddit is pretty good yeah
[22:45:06] <edk> every website that tries to reimplement navigation manages to screw it up somehow
[22:45:06] <ngoldbaum> like how do you fuck up reading from a database?
[22:45:19] <ngoldbaum> given an example that already works fine with the same database
[22:45:45] <riv> shove some disgusting ORM on top
[22:45:51] <Geekingfrog> because you have different teams responsible for different part of each page, so it's better to split everything up and have micro frontend to enable agility and empower synergy
[22:45:52] <riv> and do everything through that
[22:46:05] <companion_cube> you got to have one microservice per endpoint, ngoldbaum
[22:46:10] <companion_cube> or per table
[22:46:11] <manicennui> Reddit wants you to have the slashdot experience from 1999.
[22:46:23] <companion_cube> so then  you can do queries across microservices 😍
[22:46:23] <edk> my personal favourite thing is where youtube forgets to stop playing a video while navigating away from it
[22:46:56] <gwozniak> oh yes
[22:47:03] <gwozniak> that has happened many times to me
[22:47:18] <edk> semi-relatedly i found a spotify playlist i made many many years ago that was just 2000 songs from my play history that i'd saved into a playlist for some reason
[22:47:26] <gwozniak> And, I also love how pages elements load late and move when I go to click on them
[22:47:42] <manicennui> gwozniak: That is my personal favorite.
[22:47:49] <edk> listening to the music i listened to then was interesting but the more interesting thing was that in 2015 you could load 2000 songs of your play history at once and copy them into a playlist
[22:48:16] <gwozniak> I take it that is no longer possible
[22:48:20] <edk> yes. this must have been before spotify desktop turned into an electron
[22:48:42] <gwozniak> MS Teams is jsut getting progressively worse.  Low bar, I know, but still
[22:49:12] <gwozniak> I am wholy unimpressed with the Electron apps I have to use
[22:49:35] <ngoldbaum> javascript is just kind of a shit language to have to write everything in
[22:49:47] <ngoldbaum> even with the jit there are so many perfomance cliffs that it hobbles things
[22:51:26] <gwozniak> BUT CROSS PLATFORM EASINESS SO WE CAN USELESS AI FEATURES
[22:51:54] <gwozniak> MS teams transcribes our meetings and it is just useless
[22:51:59] <Geekingfrog> :D
[22:52:42] <prussian> AI..... future.....
[22:52:49] <gwozniak> Just to be a shit, I frequently fill out the "Give Feedback" thing and just say "this continues to be slow"
[22:53:18] <Geekingfrog> I think the main impetus is that it's javascript everywhere, so your devs are all full stack, and completely interchangeable + easier hiring time
[22:53:20] <gwozniak> I'm always cordial about it.  I don't shout or swear
[22:53:50] <gwozniak> Well good for them for optimizing their benefits over all the users' benefits
[22:53:52] <Geekingfrog> and yes, you don't need to dev your app once for each platform, at least in theory
[22:54:05] <gwozniak> My wife uses Teams for school and she has the same complaints
[22:54:25] <gwozniak> Keep in mind she ignores me on this stuff :)
[22:54:30] <companion_cube> mine is about to start usign Teams
[22:54:40] <companion_cube> it's not going to be pretty
[22:54:47] <gwozniak> What do you use now?
[22:54:57] <Geekingfrog> he complains a lot about slack
[22:54:59] <companion_cube> gwozniak: I do the same as you for google cloud :DDD
[22:55:03] <companion_cube> "it's slow"
[22:55:13] <companion_cube> oh yeah I use slack and google meet at work. could be worse.
[22:55:41] <gwozniak> I'm not even mentioning how out of sync the notifications are on a regular basis
[22:56:09] <gwozniak> The "Activity" tab will highlight with a message that I read and responded to from hours ago sometimes
[22:57:01] <gwozniak> And it's happening a lot more lately
[22:57:46] <Geekingfrog> eventual consistency baby !
[22:57:48] <gwozniak> I haven't used Slack for many years so I can't compare it to Teams
[22:57:51] <Geekingfrog> gotta scale that app
[22:57:59] <gwozniak> Geekingfrog: that's gotta be the excuse :)
[22:58:11] <gwozniak> "Well, it's not technically wrong!"
[22:59:12] <Geekingfrog> "I have notification 1 hour late" "yeah, it's the tradeof we had to make so we could handle n millions users" -_-"
[22:59:14] <gwozniak> I do wonder how Slack's wysiwyg text input compares to Teams'.  Teams' is pretty annoying

[23:09:24] <Brekkjern> imode: Pretty much
[23:09:40] <ngoldbaum> i found the no 1 thing that got me through hard undergrad classes was doing homework in groups
[23:09:48] <Brekkjern> I'll probably have to relearn some light statistical math for this
[23:09:49] <ngoldbaum> don’t know if you can do that
[23:09:57] <imode> light stats aren't difficult.
[23:10:00] <Brekkjern> Nope
[23:10:03] <imode> what's the class.
[23:10:04] <Brekkjern> I just can't remember any of it :P
[23:10:20] <Brekkjern> It's essentially NLP
[23:10:38] <Brekkjern> I haven't had any classes of it yet. Watching the first class now
[23:10:44] <Brekkjern> Recording
[23:11:15] <imode> companion_cube: glad I don't have twitter.
[23:12:09] <imode> nfts are digital pollution, they'll spill into and drain from large industry. mainstream social media is large industry.
[23:12:22] <imode> best to move on to cleaner pastures.

[23:12:56] <buttsbot> Twatter - matt_levine - there should be a higher tier of twitter blue where for $9 a month twitter will let you put someone else's ape in a hexagon
[23:13:39] <manicennui> Why does Twitter need to do anything? The user can just upload an image file.
[23:13:46] <prussian> well all you have to do is just mint a new ape using the same picture.
[23:13:48] <prussian> simple as
[23:13:52] <imode> manicennui: because they want money.
[23:13:52] <Brekkjern> manicennui: Because then they get money for it :P
[23:13:52] <prussian> no need for the extra money
[23:13:58] <manicennui> Or are people too dumb to right click and save?
[23:14:02] <Brekkjern> Yes
[23:14:09] <prussian> money talks
[23:14:09] <prussian> no?
[23:14:16] <ngoldbaum> apes talk prussian
[23:14:22] <prussian> true... true.
[23:14:26] <imode> koko couldn't.
[23:14:29] <prussian> mostly with sign language I hear.
[23:14:38] <prussian> or, don't hear?
[23:14:52] <ngoldbaum> lot of apes using irc in here
[23:14:55] <manicennui> I get that Twitter wants to make money with the blue nonsense, but I don't understand why people were asking Twitter to do something.
[23:14:58] <ngoldbaum> no AIs
[23:14:58] <imode> ook ook.
[23:15:00] <ngoldbaum> no siree
[23:15:12] <imode> manicennui: they weren't.
[23:15:18] <imode> twitter can lie.
[23:15:25] <imode> assume everyone shilling NFT shit is lying.
[23:15:26] * ngoldbaum passes the turing test in ##crustaceans
[23:16:10] <manicennui> imode: I also can't discount the possibility that NFT buyers are that dumb.
[23:16:40] <imode> inverse of hanlon's razor, dude.
[23:16:44] <prussian> so what's the difference to APEing into some bad investment and NFT Apes?

[23:17:16] <imode> prussian: that bad investment doesn't burn down forests.
[23:17:23] <imode> or launder money.

[23:21:10] <ngoldbaum> isn’t the ape thing like explicitly racist?
[23:21:21] <ngoldbaum> or did that get papered over?
[23:21:24] <imode> it originated with GME.
[23:21:34] <imode> "apes strong together". planet of the apes shit.
[23:21:53] <manicennui> Joe Rogan calls himself an ape quite often I believe.
[23:22:04] <imode> that's a disservice to apes.
[23:22:11] <Geekingfrog> :D
[23:22:16] <manicennui> I'm just wondering whether it came from there.
[23:25:14] <imode> jesus fuckin christ the GME stuff is still "ongoing".
[23:25:25] <riv> is that bad?
[23:26:20] <imode> so, initially it was legit. like, a short squeeze happened, people made money, I made money. then they turned the buy button off in the middle.
[23:26:29] <imode> they being robinhood and a couple other brokers.
[23:27:17] <imode> we're now entering year 2 of "THE MOTHER OF ALL SHORT SQUEEZES WILL HAPPEN SOON" despite the fact that it already happened.
[23:27:36] <imode> and unfortunately that crowd of idiots actually spawned the NFT craze.
[23:27:38] *** Joins: ado (uid462155@id-462155.uxbridge.irccloud.com)
[23:27:45] <imode> or at least contributed to it heavily.
[23:28:19] <imode> like, these people were genuinely convinced that they were going to tank the entire world-wide economy by buying and holding shares of gamestop.
[23:28:25] <imode> and still are.

[23:29:32] <imode> many of them bought heavily into the craze at roughly the $300 or $400 dollar marks.
[23:29:50] <imode> some dumping thousands or tens of thousands of their savings into it.
[23:30:00] <imode> GME is now roughly around $107.
[23:30:44] <manicennui> Their nonsense pops up on the front page of reddit all the time. Many of them masturbate each other over holding forever.
[23:31:06] <imode> so you lose from $200 to $300 per share you bought. I know (or knew, rather) someone who bought 75 shares at roughly $250-$300/pop.
[23:31:24] <imode> they borrowed some money to do that.
[23:31:38] <Geekingfrog> ouch
[23:31:57] <imode> that's roughly between $18k and $20k.
[23:32:00] <companion_cube> that's kind of the same price as regular shares
[23:32:01] <Brekkjern> What is the valuation now?
[23:32:02] <companion_cube> crazy
[23:32:09] <imode> at current market price?
[23:32:13] <imode> $8k.
[23:32:14] <Brekkjern> Yeah
[23:32:18] <Brekkjern> Nice...
[23:33:07] <imode> around the time of the retail trading influx from GME, people started shoving crypto as an alternative. you can sign up with a brokerage and trade on weekends! more fuel for your gambling addiction!
[23:33:42] <imode> and NFTs weren't "public" yet. at that point they were a cute idea to sell art.
[23:33:54] <manicennui> Doesn't help that a small number of them made a fuckton of money and continue to encourage the others to do dumb shit.
[23:34:00] <imode> yyyyup.
[23:34:07] <manicennui> And the ones who made money now believe they are experts.

[23:35:08] <Brekkjern> I wish I bought more BTC back in the days...
[23:35:20] <imode> I still have 30 BTC sitting on a wallet that I can't find.
[23:35:43] <Brekkjern> Yeah. I lost a wallet with 10-ish BTC back in 2009 or 10
[23:36:24] <imode> I could've lived a very different life if I stayed in crypto.
[23:36:26] <Brekkjern> Man. I zoned out entirely from this talk...
[23:37:39] <imode> I remember my boss at $crypto-job showing me how he heated his house in the winter. this was in maine. he had a giant mining setup in his basement. radiant heat was enough to keep the house warm.
[23:37:47] <manicennui> imode: Would you have become an annoying crypto bro?
[23:37:59] <imode> manicennui: I don't think I have it in me to be an anything-bro.
[23:38:06] <imode> but I probably would've shilled a bunch of shit.
[23:38:20] <Brekkjern> imode: I have my computer mining crypto to heat my apartment now. Still have to suplement it with an oven, but at least I earn some money on the heating :P
[23:38:27] <imode> my brain is like water. it settles on things that have some semblance of grounding.
[23:39:18] <imode> dogecoin made me $30k roughly a year ago because I was gifted it in an IRC channel in like, 2014.
[23:39:25] <Brekkjern> Damn
[23:39:37] <imode> they just gave it out if you talked enough. it was an IRC bot.
[23:40:01] <defect> bitcoin used to have spouts too, right? just giving them out willy nilly to get it started
[23:40:01] <buttsbot> More like buttcoin, am I rite!?
[23:40:08] <defect> yes buttsbot. quite right
[23:40:10] <imode> yeah, I collected some from that.
[23:40:25] <imode> I remember mining dogecoin on my friend's phone.
[23:40:31] <Brekkjern> I've made about 18-20k EUR on BTC. Happy enough with that, but more wouldn't hurt :P
[23:40:50] <imode> I'd rather it all just collapse.
[23:41:04] <Brekkjern> Eh. The source of the money wasn't the point :P
[23:41:44] <manicennui> In the US you could just get a PPP loan and have it forgiven.
[23:41:47] <manicennui> Free money.
[23:42:02] <imode> you really don't understand how wasteful it all is until you're standing in a warehouse that's consuming enough electricity for six nearby towns.
[23:42:10] <imode> in the backwoods of maine.
[23:42:17] <manicennui> Ended up being no oversight and most of the loans were forgiven.
[23:42:17] <imode> in winter.
[23:42:38] <manicennui> imode: Is it better if those computers are running Facebook?
[23:42:45] <Brekkjern> The crypto farms around here are usually using the waste heat for industrial purposes
[23:42:54] <manicennui> Our entire profession generates a fuckton of waste.
[23:42:54] <Brekkjern> Increases the efficiency slightly...
[23:42:55] <imode> manicennui: facebook at least has a god damn use.
[23:43:02] <manicennui> imode: Not a positive one.
[23:43:08] <imode> right, but it has a _use_.
[23:43:25] <manicennui> imode: I think some would make a similar argument about crypto.
[23:43:26] <imode> forget positive or negative, that computational load is proportional to the user base.
[23:43:50] <defect> i think facebook is pretty good at efficient datacenters too
[23:43:50] <defect> '
[23:43:57] <imode> yeah, they pay for the damn power.
[23:44:03] <defect> at least that's what they tell us
[23:44:23] <imode> I tried to pitch fully asynchronous mining ASICs to actually curb the power usage problem
[23:44:34] <imode> was working on it for some time.
[23:45:09] <imode> the power usage dropped dramatically and you could keep the hash rate significantly higher because you were functioning at the speed electrons could propagate through conductive media.
[23:45:13] <Brekkjern> Man... I need to get better at math it seems...
[23:45:16] <imode> barring operational temperature variance.
[23:46:33] <imode> clockless circuits could be the solution to crypto's giant power drain, but that's like saying that we could make an alcohol that's more difficult to metabolize so that your substance abuse problems don't seem as severe.
[23:46:55] <imode> just make crypto illegal already.
[23:47:03] <Brekkjern> Good luck with that...
[23:47:04] <imode> and throw anyone involved in prison.
[23:47:32] <imode> #EndTheGrift
[23:48:37] <bontaq> nahh crypto maximalism is good, it's a nice example of end game capitalism
[23:48:40] <manicennui> imode: Now that you made your money!
[23:49:07] <imode> ah yes, $30k, such money.
[23:49:16] <riv> but this is a one time thing
