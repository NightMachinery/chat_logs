[00:56:27] <Adoi> hello, how much should I worry if a usb drive is inserted in a machine that it shouldnt have been?
[00:56:35] <DarkFeather> uhhh
[00:56:46] <ajak> maybe
[00:57:11] <DarkFeather> Well, physical access is death. Any forensics of what's on the drive? Is the person that inserted it trusted or malicious, or is the device in public space where anyone could do it?
[00:59:16] <catbeard> are they on camera doing it?

[01:00:27] <Adoi> DarkFeather, the person who inserted it is safe, the device is also not in public. the drive does not contain any particular data, but was used for general-purpose web work
[01:00:43] <catbeard> did it ever contain sensitive information
[01:00:46] <Adoi> no#
[01:01:05] <catbeard> then probably not
[01:01:14] <Adoi> also, the mistake was detected when the device was on grub screen, and device powered off
[01:01:32] <catbeard> probably the pc was configured to boot from usb stick
[01:01:37] <catbeard> maybe enable UEFI only booting
[01:02:07] <catbeard> if it was supposed to do that, and it's turning off on boot, check the power supply and reseat the memory e.g.
[01:02:36] <Adoi> it did not power off by itself, it was powered off manually when the mistake was realized
[01:02:57] <catbeard> ah okay
[01:03:08] <catbeard> then no worries, you probably just have CSM boot still enabled to where one could boot via USB stick
[01:03:20] <Adoi> so a few seconds of grub screen, and then power off
[01:03:44] <Adoi> did the usb dump all the malware of the world onto the device?

[05:52:50] <Joanna> Government jobs involve a lot of rules and regulations

[05:53:58] <Joanna> The coworkers part probably isn’t limited to government jobs though..
[05:55:29] <vt0> Correct. Dicks are ubiquitous
[05:56:01] <Joanna> The culture of government jobs brings out the worst in people
[05:56:23] <Joanna> It’s all about punishment

[06:02:40] <Joanna> One thing they definitely don’t like are people who think or ask questions.
[06:03:08] <vt0> But the cool thing about government work is the prerequisites to get the job in the first place are so valuable you can usually just set your own terms and work where you want because the applicant pools are so small
[06:05:48] <vt0> "The government" wanting unthinking drones in infosec/etc roles hasn't been my experience, but maybe mine is unique.
