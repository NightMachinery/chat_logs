[02:46:38] <question> the thing is, i'm using ubuntu on this computer, and it had no problem to connect to the new router. but win7... i'm searching for hours
[02:47:51] <tomreyn> there is #windows. but they will most liklely not support EOL releases either
[02:48:08] <Maik> question: Windows is not supported here and besides that W7 isn't supported anymore, so....
[02:48:39] <question> yes, no problem.
[02:48:42] <Maik> we only support Ubuntu and it's official flavors

[02:50:44] <question> my ubuntu question would be: why does mozilla show "this connection is not secure" so often.
[02:51:15] <jhutchins> Windows does funky default "we know what's good for you" things with networking, and likes to charge extra for the "pro" version that lets you actually connect (sometimes).

[02:52:54] <jhutchins> question: I believe that's what you'll get from a site that'st plain http only (no https).
[02:53:05] <question> ubuntu studio
[02:53:27] <matsaman> you don't really need to worry about security when you're not transmitting sensitive information
[02:53:29] <question> for creative people :)
[02:53:36] <matsaman> credit card info, highly private browsing habits, etc.
[02:53:39] <matsaman> home address
[02:54:12] <jhutchins> The kind of information you commonly find in a phone book ...
[02:54:38] *** Quits: beaver (~beaver@user/pong) (Remote host closed the connection)
[02:55:03] <matsaman> no, more private than that, but
[02:55:12] <matsaman> if your name & address _is_ in a phone book, it's still not tied to your IP
[02:55:22] <matsaman> not until you set about making it that way
[02:56:05] <matsaman> someone who already knows your name, and finds an address linked to that name is an altogether different problem
[02:56:17] <question> can i check my emails (gmx) by using the ubuntu console? because firefox does not want to open the webpage.
[02:56:37] <matsaman> question: you should be able to use pop or imap with gmx, I forget which they offer
[02:56:54] <question> ok
[02:56:59] <ravage> question: which version of Ubuntu Studio?
[02:57:29] <question> that's a good question. how do i find out?
[02:58:09] <question> it's old
[02:58:24] <Bashing-om> question: ' lsb_release -a ' .
[02:59:09] <ravage> If your Firefox does not support modern websites anymore it must be ancient
[02:59:19] <ravage> And you should reinstall your whole system
[02:59:26] <question> Ubuntu 12.04.2 LTS
[02:59:56] <Bashing-om> !12.04 | question
[02:59:56] <ubottu> question: Ubuntu 12.04 LTS (Precise Pangolin) was the 16th release of Ubuntu. !End-of-life was April 28th 2017. See https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-security-announce/2017-April/003833.html and !eol for more information

[03:00:44] <Bashing-om> !eol | question
[03:00:44] <ubottu> question: End-Of-Life is when security updates and support for an Ubuntu release stop. Make sure to update Ubuntu before it goes EOL so you get updates promptly for newly-discovered security vulnerabilities. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EOL and https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Releases for more info. Looking to upgrade from an EOL release? See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EOLUpgrades

[15:50:43] <tomreyn> whyglobaleyes: hi! the main purpose of this channel is to support those who notice that something about their ubuntu installation doesn't work as it should be. you're trying to solve an individually chosen task that's not about solving a problem - you may find it more difficult to get help with this here.
[15:50:48] *** Joins: alive (~alive@ng.nixy.dk)
[15:51:20] <tomreyn> for bash scripting, there is #bash, but we can also help to a degree here. for generic questions around linux and linux distros, there is #linux.
[15:51:28] <tomreyn> what you'd create by scripting, would be a textual list, and there are tools to automatically create PDF documents based on unstructured or structured textual input.
[15:51:28] <whyglobaleyes> @tomreyn thank you. any odea which channel might be better please?

[16:06:13] <broccoli> Hi folks. Occasionally (every few days â€” I have to restart to get them to go away) I have processes that spin at 100% CPU. They can't be killed, even by `kill -9`. Looking at `/proc/2780701/stat`, the system time keeps increasing and increasing whereas the userspace time stays the same (so I think it's stuck in a syscall). Trying to attach GDB
[16:06:14] <broccoli> with `gdb -p 2780701` just makes gdb hang. Looking at `/proc/2780701/stack`, it seems something is happening but it's not very enlightening. Any ideas how I can get more details about this (or optimistically: even solve it)?

[16:38:37] <tomreyn> broccoli: and i'm wondering whether you changed this from the default
[16:38:52] <broccoli> I don't have particular reason to think I put them there, but it's possible some of them have been influenced by the config file on the pi's bootloader (which if I understand is unlikely to be grub :/)
[16:39:20] <betuxy> Kilroy: installing libpcre2-dev worked, i was confused because it explicitly asked for the so file that actually existed in fs. thanks though
[16:39:36] <tomreyn> oh right not grub, i'm silly.

[22:15:41] <moha> During Ubuntu Server installation I checked a tick for NextCloud and it's installed by snap. Now I need to change some configuration file of NextCloud to fix some errors, but not possible because of snap: Editting is not allowed ! Do you have any solution?
[22:15:43] <Wakko[m]> Well, i guess i must get used to live without touchpad.
[22:17:15] <marc_> or you could install MS windows and the touchpad would work.
[22:17:35] <leftyfb> marc_: stop
[22:18:08] <marc_> well its not an ubutu issue is it
[22:18:12] <leftyfb> Wakko[m]: can you boot into the BIOS and see if there's an option to enabled/disable the touchpad? Or better yet, to test it
[22:18:20] <leftyfb> marc_: that has yet to be confirmed
