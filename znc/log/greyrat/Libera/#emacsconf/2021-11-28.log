[00:02:08] <shrysr> what does skeleton do though?
[00:02:14] <gagbo> it’s different, because ligatures (usually) don’t break alignment like replacing 6 characters ("lambda") with 1 does
[00:02:16] <asilata> garjola: no, I usually don't, I find it slows down my system a bit.

[00:58:12] <kimjetwav> opalvaults: I should get back to it. I used it early and loved it, and then the dev added vim+cua keybinds and made emacs keys not the default and I lost track of how to use it, even though it's literally one funcall to get the keybindings back. It really is a great browser.
[00:58:16] <`andrea> `opalvaults definitely: they need a decent adblocking still
[00:58:19] <lounge-073> has nyxt a dark mode ?
[00:58:32] <maxxcan> lounge-073: yes
[00:58:36] <lounge-073> the default bright white background is horrible :(

[00:58:47] <`andrea> `Noisytoot don't think so, but is a good question about LibreJS
[00:58:49] <tgbugs> lounge-073: very late response, but the reason I talked about powershell more than the others is because it is the most different and required some explainiation, I also was :/ about that
[00:59:10] <opalvaults> kimjetwav: I use evil bindings so that might not be bad for someone who isn't used to vanilla emacs keybindings
[00:59:16] <Noisytoot> (if you add a '`' before my nick it doesn't highlight me)
[00:59:17] <NullNix> lounge-073: it's unfortunately necessary due to the number of website designers who override foreground colours to black without setting the background colour

[01:00:04] <opalvaults> `andrea: I thought I read somewhere that this browser was attempting to allow extensions in a similar manner to Chrome/Firefox extensions.
[01:00:13] <opalvaults> It'd be nice to have a central location to grab those, install them etc.
[01:00:22] <GNUHacker> another emacs browser? i preffer eww
[01:00:30] <adolfo> does nyxt also have an inspector, to edit html and css?
[01:00:36] <`andrea> `opalvaults yeah I read that too, looking forward to it
[01:00:43] <GNUHacker> wait thats YT?
[01:00:44] <opalvaults> GNUHacker: this one isn't specific to Emacs. It does use Emacs keybindings and such however.
[01:00:55] <opalvaults> You may use it independantly of Emacs if you choose.
[01:00:58] <tgbugs> lounge-073: sadly I need to be able to support users on windows and found a lingering bug deep down in the buffer encoding code as a result :x
[01:01:03] <`andrea> `adolfo: yes, I am just sending my JS to the inspector via Common Lisp
[01:01:03] <lounge-073> GNUHacker eww is the browser for sure. it looks like nyxt is a good alternative to the big blaoted ff/chrome options. xD

[01:23:52] <tgbugs> because you will never find an average due to the variability in the human population
[01:24:08] <bandali> pad for asking questions: https://etherpad.wikimedia.org/p/emacsconf-2021
[01:24:10] <esrh`> looks beautiful
[01:24:22] <opalvaults> I agree
[01:24:35] <NullNix> how much of that is just bigger margins and roboto though?
[01:24:39] <NullNix> roboto is beautiful
[01:24:41] <maxxcan> I love nano Emacs. I use it too
[01:24:52] <esrh`> i wonder if I can steal the splash screen and header line
[01:24:54] <opalvaults> I really think that the default emacs theme could use this kind of effort and scrutiny in order to improve it
[01:24:58] <NullNix> A4: good idea, but few people have A4 *screens*...
[01:25:14] <esrh`> holy crap it looks so good
[01:25:14] <Noisytoot> I don't think the default aspect ratio would work well on my screen (at least vertically)
[01:25:17] <opalvaults> As long as they don't get rid of the aesthetic Emacs logo <3
[01:25:26] <danielsousaio[m4> Awesome!!
[01:25:29] <Emru> really nice
[01:25:42] <lounge-077> Looks great!!
[01:25:50] <NullNix> yet again, though, the contrast is awful! black and white, please, not light grey and not-quite-so-light grey
[01:25:50] <garjola> A4 aspect ratio is difficult on a laptop!

[01:49:02] <kimjetwav> GNUHacker: I'd "M-x yow" but alas

[01:49:56] <sachac> We did the captioning using subed.el in Emacs, using the speakers' Org files or autogenerated captions from Youtube as starting points.
[01:50:06] <sachac> ooh, pad, will check
[01:51:03] <jrootabega> Oh yeah, will definitely find a way to volunteer next time!
[01:51:08] <opalvaults> Yeah absolutely, would love to donate.
[01:51:37] <sachac> for example, if some people could help with streaming alternate tracks, we could have longer talks and longer Q&As

[01:52:48] <sachac> so our current strategy is lots of short talks/demos, and then people can learn more about the stuff that they find interesting
[01:53:00] <zleap> sounds good
[01:53:01] <sachac> but it would be so nice to have more deep dives too
[01:53:05] <opalvaults> I think having alternate tracks is a great idea sachac, I think I noticed that speakers were very rushed because time was tight, and it'd be cool to that have that alleviated.
[01:53:27] <opalvaults> And it would likely reduce stress for you guys so that technical issues aren't as dire.
[01:53:30] <sachac> other conferences are more selective, I think, but... it's Emacs! we want everything!
[01:53:51] <zleap> sachac, maybe if we can figure out some topics that would be good to dive deeper into (attendee feedback) that could be looked in to
[01:54:05] <sachac> zleap: Maybe Org can spin off into its own conference

[01:56:58] <opalvaults> bandali: do you think there's a place for some kind of configuration management in this process? I'm DevOps lite, and curious how it could be streamlined if at all for Conf purposes

[18:49:39] <lounge-978> Agreed about the lack of formal grammar (only a proliferation of parsers) being a limiting factor. Maybe we could bridge directly to the available commands without going through a grammar though. A unified tree-editing framework across languages but definitely including Org would be awesome (ala lispy/etc).
[18:49:59] <Cairn> Wow, pretty Emacs setup
[18:50:53] <publicvoit> For Org mode, we do have https://github.com/200ok-ch/org-parser/blob/master/resources/org.ebnf EBNF which should be a good start IMHO.

[20:45:31] <ieure> opalvaults, EXWM is fiddly on multi-monitor setups, main thing is that it doesn't automatically do anything when you plug a display in, so you have to manually configure things.

[20:52:53] <bigodel[m]> for dmenu it would be as simple as
[20:52:53] <bigodel[m]> `choice=$(echo "home\nwork" | dmenu -p "choose monitor setup:")` 
[20:52:53] <bigodel[m]> and then a case statement with the xrandr scripts generated by arandr

[20:54:27] <bigodel[m]> yeah, if you're using EXWM you can take advantage of vertico and marginalia to add annotations and more
[20:55:02] <bigodel[m]> i guess `completing-read` is Emacs' `dmenu`
[20:55:32] <ieure> bigodel[m], autorandr is like that, but much nicer.  You set stuff up how you want, then `autorandr -s home` (or work, or whatever).  Then you can `autorandr -c` and it'll autodetect the hardware config & apply the saved randr config.

At my last job, I used it a lot when I had to figure out how systems had broken.  The ability to combine prose, annotate production code, link to pull requests, pull data from SQL, and digest that with elisp or Python was amazing.  I'd generally export to Markdown and stick hyper-detailed

[22:45:39] <GNUHacker> :O
[22:45:51] <ieure> ++ to all that stuff.  Great job on the captions, and the demonstrated functionality is very impressive.
[22:45:51] <protesilaos> Yay for the captions!
[22:46:19] <paraparity> This has been really slick. Kudos for the captions including the Farsi characters and latin text.
[22:46:20] <sachac> Yay captions! =)
[22:46:26] <TDT> At first, I thought the captions would be unnecessary, but over time, understanding the accents for various individuals has been challenging, so the captions helped.
[22:46:42] <opalvaults> protesilaos: do you use the Greek Alphabet with Emacs at all?
[22:46:52] <sachac> paraparity: I hadn't quite figured out how to fix bidi + punctuations, so sometimes I just put them on separate lines
[22:47:02] <greta> @lounge-358 agreed! I will be passing this on to some colleagues!
[22:47:03] <protesilaos> opalvaults: Yes, though not as much as Latin.

[22:48:10] <Cairn> tgbugs: That's a great idea
[22:48:24] <TDT> One stuggle I have with this input method option is, why not use an IME that's installed on the host OS?
[22:48:25] <opalvaults> protesilaos: is there any additions that you have to add to emacs for using non-English/latin characters or does it work mostly out of the box?

[22:48:51] <TDT> I mean, I do that with Japanese, but that may no longer work easily with qubes, so maybe it's more of a thing that'd benefit me now.

[22:49:51] <Cairn> TDT: Not a primary reason, but since I'm used to configuring Emacs, I've found it a lot easier to learn to configure the integrated IMF than to configure an external one.
[22:49:57] <tgbugs> I used SCIM/uim for japanese input at one put, but that was before I used emacs, it was a nightmare to set up

[22:50:30] <ieure> Does OS-level stuff work when you have to change character direction on the same line, like LtR numbers in a RtL script?
[22:50:53] <opalvaults> Simple. Cool, thanks for the info :)
[22:51:27] <TDT> jeroentesttest[m:  Thanks for adding it.  Just opened and saw it there. 
[22:51:37] <Cairn> Like johnw said in his review of Emacs 28, we're going to be getting a way to make temporary switching into an IME even easier. So it'll feel even more seamless.
[22:51:58] <TDT> I may have to try this, the IMEs I've used haven't been an issue too much in the past, but...maybe this would be better, at least I wouldn't have to worry about config on each qube.
[22:52:13] <tgbugs> re: enml: worth looking at sxml
[22:52:25] <gak> Banan's work on BIDI support is an eye-opener...
[22:52:31] <Cairn> That's suggestion about the new ML is interesting. I'd be curious to see what other solutions exist that are similar to that idea.

[23:09:24] <opalvaults> I could be wrong about that. I think if Nyxt extensions take off, and are able to be written by the community and implemented in a way similar to firefox, we could really have a powerful and extensible Lisp browser that can compete when it comes to security and tracking, etc.

[23:18:29] <tgbugs> idefun definitely helped by a docstring
[23:18:32] <Digit> clearly, imaginary programming needs a much longer talk.
[23:18:41] <matthewzmd> esrh: Yes, it uses PyQt5 and it's essentially painting the Qt frame on top of emacs, simulating a buffer. EPC is used for Elisp <-> Python <-> JS communication
[23:18:51] <aindilis> definitely.  this is a good intro though.
[23:19:07] <NullNix> tgbugs: idefun is implemented purely by its docstring, I suppose :P
[23:19:16] <ieure> jrootabega, I'm pretty sure that sound is in the talk recording.
[23:19:17] <opalvaults> Man, I really think it would be awesome to have shane be able to explain some of these ideas more in depth as they are obviously very deep topics. I'd love to help contribute next year to possibly creating a way to have multiple talks going on at once so people have more time to speak. I believe it was sachac who mentioned it yesterday.
[23:19:19] <aindilis> yeah that's a use-case, gen from docstring
[23:19:26] <NullNix> matthewzmd: I guess/hope this is using qtwebengine, not qtwebkit?

[23:19:42] <jrootabega> ieure: was wondering
[23:19:43] <sachac> opalvaults: Yes, we figure we need maybe at least 2-3 more people so that they can focus on running a separate stream
[23:19:50] <sachac> we're running pretty much at capacity right now =)
[23:19:55] <lilyp> This vaguely reminds me of that one Python package that generates a CLI parser from the help string
[23:20:02] <Thomas67> v. informative, thanks!
[23:20:06] <tgbugs> the full abstraction would look something like an interactive proof program
[23:20:09] <lounge-459> libertyprime re slide 27, would it mean that 2 such "idefined" function would be the "same", meaning do the same thing the same way, given that they are defined without a "body"?

[23:45:38] <NullNix> lilyp: oh yeah, it's a future change, not something that could possibly have been added when cedet was being written
[23:45:43] <Cairn> tgbugs: Fair

[23:45:51] <NullNix> Eric never had a time machine, even if it looked like he did when wisent was written
[23:46:21] <gnu_ninja> @codingquark I think the modus themes are in elpa :/
[23:47:01] <codingquark> gnu_ninja: they indeed are. But what I'm saying is that instead of whatever thing Emacs first starts with, we switch that to use modus-themes
[23:47:04] <lounge-544> publicvoit : would it be worth considering a decoupling of the "orgdown" proposal into 1) just a proposal to rename "org" the markup as "orgdown" (vs "org-mode" for the piece of software running in Emacs), and 2) all the rest as in the levels/etc? Just to not put the first at risk of non-adoption because of the contents of the second? There seems
[23:47:04] <lounge-544> to be a lot of positive sentiment towards solving #1 for sure.

[23:47:30] <lilyp> ieure: thanks for the pointer, but I think I have some more pressing cl-defgeneric reimplementations to make before I touch that
[23:47:52] <lilyp> orgdown is not org, the markup
[23:48:06] <lilyp> orgdown is lightweight org, it does not have all the features
[23:48:07] <gnu_ninja> @codingquark I think they're going to be included in stock emacs. Prot is waiting for all the paperwork to be completed.
[23:48:18] <tgbugs> lounge-544: In general I agree, there will be issues with how to approach the levels
[23:48:25] <publicvoit> lounge-544: Valid approach but this train has left the station already by the decision of myself to provide OD1 to the public this weekend.

[23:48:27] <ieure> lilyp, Extremely fair.  One thing I didn't get to touch on is that you can extend generic functions from anywhere.  So you don't have to patch up cl-generic.el, you can define a new method for a generic function defined anywhere, in any file.  Which rules.
[23:48:43] * Cairn claps
[23:48:46] <TDT> Kinda curious what theme some of these people are using for their presentations.  Looks a lot different than mine.  Wondering almost if it's doom-macs or whatever that's called.
[23:48:55] <Cairn> loud
[23:48:56] <jeroentesttest[m> loud :)
[23:49:03] <jeroentesttest[m> better :)
[23:49:05] <codingquark> gnu_ninja: AIUI, wombat etc are also included in Emacs core right? Say, when I run `emacs -Q' what theme (if any) does it load?
[23:49:07] <tgbugs> od1 is fortunately minimally specified
[23:49:29] <ieure> TDT, I used the default theme on vanilla Emacs (+ 15 years of my hacks), and org-tree-slide.
[23:49:35] <lilyp> ieure yeah, I'll first try rewriting that part from my init.el before sending a patch, but still would be nice to have upstream support for regexp dispatch
[23:49:42] <lounge-544> lilyp : the larger point being the potentially contentious things to finalize about levels/etc (if any disagreement, but that's par for the course in the Emacs world), so we could fix this recurring naming thing that's come up many times in this chat so far, and build on this with the rest of the proposal.
[23:49:45] <zaeph> Don't forget to add your questions in the pad: https://etherpad.wikimedia.org/p/emacsconf-2021
[23:50:19] <gnu_ninja> @codingquark Whatever the emacs default theme is. :/
[23:50:23] <ieure> lilyp, That it would.
[23:50:44] <tgbugs> lounge-544: the thing about levels is that they don't prevent more granular, featured based approaches
[23:50:45] <lilyp> To be fair, I personally don't think adding tiers to org-mode makes much sense
[23:51:01] <lilyp> We should rather have a feature matrix for stuff like pandoc to check against
[23:51:08] <ieure> The default Emacs theme is fine & I'll be cranky if I have to twiddle a setting to change it back.  That is all.
[23:51:10] <NullNix> I don't think the default colours constitute a theme, since themes are defined in terms of the change from the default (or, really, from whatever you're using now)
[23:51:23] <akrl> I loooove loop :)
[23:51:37] <ieure> loop / cl-loop is very good stuff.
[23:51:45] <tgbugs> lilyp: developing the test suite will get us there, and then we can have the discussion about how to market the levels
[23:51:51] <codingquark> NullNix: right, I suspected this and was trying to rephrase my question appropriately
[23:51:56] <akrl> half of native-comp is written in loop :D :D
[23:52:15] <bandali> :D
[23:52:26] <NullNix> codingquark: this is sometimes annoying, but of course it's an accident of history, in that emacs colour definition is decades older than themes...
[23:52:33] <lounge-544> lilyp tgbugs : both your comments highlight why it may be interesting to resolve the naming thing independently of the other aspects of the larger proposals (levels and such), to address only the recurring comments about this
[23:52:39] <ieure> I *hope* cl-loop is more efficient than building a bunch of intermediate lists when you chain map/filter/reduce operations.
[23:52:39] <NullNix> akrl: half of bindat is written in loop :P
[23:52:51] <lounge-544> lilyp tgbugs : just a thought though
[23:53:12] <corwin> ieure: it def is by the time it gets though nativecomp ;)
[23:53:20] <akrl> NullNix: loop party!!
[23:53:27] <tgbugs> lounge-544: I think we could adopt orgdown almost immediately without issue
[23:53:30] <lilyp> I don't really see a big issue with org-mode vs. org vs. orgWHATEVER though
[23:53:49] <tgbugs> there are major search and discovery issues with bare "org"

[23:54:04] <lilyp> Like what I use org for heavily depends.
[23:54:42] <lilyp> At one time, I'm calculating work hours, at another I'm writing (not Harry Potter, but still) fanfic.
[23:54:42] <tgbugs> I tend to use "org syntax" at the moment, but it isn't catchy enough
