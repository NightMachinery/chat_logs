[12:58:40] <skyroveRR> Hey guys, suppose I have a browser tab open that echos to HTML a unique session ID assigned by PHP via session_start() function. And then I close the web browser and open it again but this time it's a session ID. How is the web browser able to signal to the PHP server that it's closing the tab and uninitializing the session *while* it is closing? And how is it that subsequently when a fresh instance of the web
[12:58:42] <skyroveRR> browser is opened and the page is opened again, you get a new session ID?

[14:45:35] <aruns> We have an inherited OpenCart client site at work using the Journal2 theme, all I want to know is best practices when it comes to knowing which files can be modified or not, as I want to add a custom CSS stylesheet, but I am not sure which files' changes will be nuked if the theme updates.
[14:48:10] <AllenJB> That's going to be very application specific. I'd suggest asking in an opencart specific forum / channel ( https://forum.opencart.com/ )

[16:40:25] <Blondie101010> no but it logs, sooo

[16:41:22] <Blondie101010> so your question in itself doesn't allow you to evaluate if it does what you need
[16:41:55] <Blondie101010> what matters is what you actually need to log/track, and make it happen
[16:42:06] <AllenJB> It's not logging in the traditional sense of a single file / stream of messages. It's event (exception) based notifications / monitoring.

[16:43:47] <Repox> Hey guys. I don't know if it's possible, my Google-fu is apparently awful. I'm trying to output PHP errors in FPM directly to the process running, so I can follow the errors via Docker logs. Currently, errors are only showing in the requested script via the browser, but I'd like to follow the errors from the running FPM process (if possible).
