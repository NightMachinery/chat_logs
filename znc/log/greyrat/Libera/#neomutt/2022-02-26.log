[01:27:21] <jindraj> Palanix: basically there's none lynx integration. Neomutt supports mailcap which enables you to use lynx. So you're here at the correct place to ask your question.
[01:27:41] <Palanix> Okay thank you
[01:28:12] <Palanix> Lynx has a feature that allows to you view all the links on a page. Is there a way to access that in neomutt as well?
[01:31:53] *** Joins: gabriel1 (~gabriel1@user/gabriel1)
[01:33:37] <jindraj> Palanix: yes, I'm not sure whether you can utilize lynxs for this. if there's a specific commmand to generate list of links you can do similar use bindings similar to this: https://superuser.com/a/333866 just change the command to reflect yours.

[16:43:31] <dcpurton> Why does `set crypt_chars = "üîèüîíüîèüîë "` work
[16:44:00] <dcpurton> But neither `set crypt_chars = "‚úíÔ∏èüîí‚úíÔ∏èüîë "` or
[16:44:20] <dcpurton> set crypt_chars = "üñãÔ∏èüîíüñãÔ∏èüîë " work?
[16:44:44] <dcpurton> (Wrong icons appear)
[16:45:30] <dcpurton> I use:
[16:45:32] <dcpurton> set index_format = "%4C%2zc%zs%zt %{%d %b} %-20.20L %?l?%4l&%4c? %M %s"
[16:46:38] <dcpurton> gvim seems to treat ‚úíÔ∏è as a single width character too, which is odd
[16:47:34] * flatcap tries
[16:48:18] <dcpurton> Maybe there is a font bug. Those icons are causing rendering problems in weechat for me too
[16:48:34] <dcpurton> Or a kitty bug
[16:51:37] <flatcap> hmm...
[16:51:53] <flatcap> the original four icons are single unicode characters
[16:52:25] <flatcap> the pen char, is two: pen + 0xFE0F (emoji-selector)
[16:52:46] <dcpurton> Yes! I just noticed this. Something is not handling the emoji modifier that I learned about in that other thread‚Ä¶
[16:53:09] <dcpurton> This is true for both pen and nib
[16:53:12] <flatcap> yeah
[16:53:47] <flatcap> it'd probably be helpful if we taught neomutt about 0xfe0f
[16:54:07] <flatcap> it probably just needs to happen in config/mbtable.c
[16:54:17] <flatcap> that's where the string is parsed

[16:59:01] <flatcap> üëçüèæ
[16:59:03] <dcpurton> actually skin tones don't use ZWJ, that's other things like :person_scientist:

[17:01:13] <dcpurton> kitty can display it with cat, but not much else can
[17:02:26] <dcpurton> that makes sense of the wrong icon being displayed. If I put just one pen in, then the final character is a key instead of a space and that gets used for all emails with PGP 
[17:04:16] <flatcap> yeah
