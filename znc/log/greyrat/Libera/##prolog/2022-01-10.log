[07:25:06] <aindilis> That's cool about Yaswi: I use Yaswi and also Perl<->Inline::Java--JavaPengines->Prolog
[07:25:42] <aindilis> I find that Yaswi is high throughput, high latency, and Pengine is low throughput, low latency
[07:25:59] <aindilis> was thinking about making a single interface which chose the best route
[07:26:29] <aindilis> ty for suggesting reinforcement schedules!

[07:29:59] <aindilis> hey, you know I have a patch I think for Yaswi that I downloaded hehe: don't know if it's been added yet.  let me fetch a link
[07:31:10] <sivoais> aindilis: would be happy to see it!
[07:32:33] <aindilis> https://frdcsa.org/~andrewdo/Language-Prolog-Yaswi-0.21-Adjust-list-parsing-to-SWI-Prolog-7.patch
[07:34:03] <sivoais> ah, that's been applied! The only issue with Yaswi right now is that you have to compile against a very old or very new SWI-Prolog because of symbol conflict
[07:34:09] <aindilis> ah
[07:34:59] *** Quits: waleee (~waleee@h-98-128-229-110.NA.cust.bahnhof.se) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[07:35:21] <sivoais> relevant issue if you want the specifics <https://github.com/SWI-Prolog/swipl-devel/issues/900>
[07:35:25] <aindilis> ty!
[07:35:36] <aindilis> yeah, thanks for keep Yaswi going!  my life sorta depends on it hehe (with the Free Life Planner) http://freelifeplanner.org
[07:36:14] <sivoais> :-D
[07:38:53] <aindilis> so I have tons of legacy Perl code in FRDCSA, as well as new development, and lots of new Prolog code, and I can have the best of both worlds.  Do you use Yaswi?
[07:41:03] <sivoais> I'll look more into Pengines later. I think I can make that work (difference between Yaswi and Pengines is that Yaswi lets you call back into Perl)
[07:42:27] <sivoais> I do! I used it for an expert system research project a long time ago. Now I'm using it to query code metadata. I have other things I plan to do with it later on.
[07:42:44] <aindilis> we should talk more about your applications!
[07:42:54] <aindilis> As you know, Prolog can be terse, is a bit unwieldy, but is powerful as all get out, especially if you use in conjunction with CYC discipline.  I think of Prolog as a battleship.  Perl is obviously incredible too, but has different niches.
[07:43:36] <aindilis> Ooh, I have an Interlingua system for communicating efficiently between Perl/Prolog/ELisp
[07:43:54] <aindilis> https://github.com/aindilis/freekbs2/tree/master/KBS2/ImportExport/Mod
[07:44:34] <aindilis> (I've never published all my stuff to CPAN, kinda limited skills on my end).
[07:44:49] <sivoais> Sure, I'd love to at some point! My main Perl side project (lol) right now is a document reader. I'm working towards adding NLP and Linked Data support to it. All it does right now is display PDFs. It's Gtk3.
[07:45:04] <sivoais> <https://github.com/project-renard/curie>
[07:45:20] <aindilis> Cool!  hey, I wrote one too.  https://altruisticsoftware.org/frdcsa/internal/clear
[07:45:40] <sivoais> hah, we both use Festival!
[07:45:40] <aindilis> oh by reader, you mean viewer, or does it TTS?
[07:45:42] <aindilis> :)
[07:45:44] <aindilis> cool
[07:45:58] <sivoais> Both!
[07:46:05] <aindilis> good going!  a good reader is imperative.  I like that you are using linked data, and NLP
[07:46:18] <aindilis> Perl is good for NLP obviously.
[07:46:36] <sivoais> Not using them yet, but it's in the roadmap: <http://project-renard.github.io/doc/development/roadmap/>
[07:47:03] <aindilis> (Here are some of the external NLP systems I've wrapped: https://frdcsa.org/visual-aid/pdf/existing-capabilities.pdf )
[07:47:30] <aindilis> CLEAR can display lines being read, but only in Perl/Tk text interface.  Can you highlight the text inside the PDF, for instance, while reading it?
[07:48:01] <aindilis> anyway, we should collaborate a bunch!  I like that you intend to read mathematical text as well.
[07:48:12] <aindilis> Your system looks awesome!
[07:48:30] <aindilis> I see - "Document text (e.g., highlight text linearly or as a block)"
[07:48:43] <aindilis> so CLEAR records which sentence was read and when
[07:49:05] <aindilis> the idea is to eventually use NLP to know what the user might know 
[07:49:11] <aindilis> by monitoring their reading flux
[07:49:37] <aindilis> ( https://github.com/aindilis/clear )
[07:49:43] <sivoais> I recently added clipboard support (1 year ago). I need to get back to it, but I haven't worked on it directly right now. I've been doing devops work for PDL for a couple months.
[07:49:52] <sivoais> I think we have some similar goals!
[07:49:55] <aindilis> :)
[07:50:07] <sivoais> So you've seen Anki, Super Memo, and incremental reading?
[07:50:21] <sivoais> (this also matches up with the idea of reinforcement schedules from earlier)
[07:50:25] <aindilis> I've seen Anki.  but not super memo or incremental reading.
[07:50:29] <aindilis> afaict
[07:51:17] <sivoais> OK, so Anki and Super Memo use similar algorithms to schedule cards for review. It originated with Super Memo.
[07:51:42] <sivoais> Super Memo has a feature that Anki does not (excluding one Anki plugin) -- incremental reading
[07:52:38] <aindilis> looks fascinating!
[07:53:19] <sivoais> It lets you go through a text and read it bit-by-bit in a way that you can memorise parts of it as you read.
[07:53:32] <aindilis> :)
[07:53:56] <sivoais> You basically highlight the text you want to memorise and then you can do different things with that extract. One of which is create a cloze deletion.
[07:54:33] <aindilis> cloze?
[07:54:35] <sivoais> So you can create flash cards as you are reading.
[07:54:39] <aindilis> ah
[07:55:15] <sivoais> Cloze deletion is the fill in the blank kind of questions: Q: [...] is the powerhouse of the [...] ?  A: mitochondria, cell
[07:55:30] <aindilis> ah, I implemented that in CLEAR
[07:55:55] <aindilis> It's neat to see what you're doing, it's next generation of where I would have taken CLEAR
[07:56:29] <aindilis> nice that you can organize docs
[07:56:47] <aindilis> I may offer to help at some point
[07:57:11] <aindilis> seems like this is a total research solution
[07:57:35] <sivoais> So one of the things I wanted to do is add NLP into that mix by looking at phrase extraction algorithms (I have a prototype using PyTextRank) to help generate the flashcards.
[07:58:05] <sivoais> I've also wanted to look into the flip-side of question answering: question generation (there seems to be less research here than with QA systems)
[07:58:15] <aindilis> right on
[07:59:24] <sivoais> Yes, exactly! I got this idea while I was doing research and was frustrated with what exists now. My thought was "what if there was a document reader that was as powerful for that task as Vim/Emacs are for the text editing task?"
[07:59:54] <aindilis> :)  This is great.  I can offer some suggested feature ideas too.
[08:00:52] <aindilis> I have to leave for the night, but let's follow up tomorrow...  sound good?  I'll read all your stuff too so I stop asking questions covered in the syllabus.
[08:01:08] <sivoais> Would love that! This is a wiki by the way so PR's welcome <https://github.com/project-renard/project-renard.github.io>.
[08:01:11] <sivoais> Night then!
[08:01:14] <aindilis> night!
[08:02:50] <sivoais> aindilis: these might be a little bit more insightful reading <https://enetdown.org/tag/document_reader/>. The wiki is a little scattered.
[08:04:49] <aindilis> ty!
[08:04:58] <aindilis> will read!
