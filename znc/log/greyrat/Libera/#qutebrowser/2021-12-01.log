[11:58:06] <ktprograms> The-Compiler: The two big problems I can see with the scroll hints PR are: (a) The h/j/k/l keys don't apply to the selected scroll area (only :scroll-px does), and (b) There isn't any way to reset the selected scroll area to the default (whole page) scroll.
[12:01:04] <ktprograms> Also, I think ':hint scrollable' should probably say 'No elements found.' like ':hint all tab-fg' does if there aren't any scrollable areas to select.

[21:59:50] <taeaad> OK. Alternatively, is it possible to download the current page as HTML but without re-requesting the URL? Some pages don't like being called with wget as they want to spam you with Javascript first.

[22:05:15] <natris1979[m]> other browsers have a "copy as curl" thing. Wouldn't be too hard to implement in QB I'd think. then you could add `-fLO` to the curl params to get it to act like wget

[22:07:10] <taeaad> natris1979[m]: The issue with that is that there could be Javascript that edits the HTML.
[22:07:34] <natris1979[m]> oh see what you mean
[22:07:37] <taeaad> It's popular these days to try to force users into the same web experience (i.e., everything must be via the browser).
[22:11:42] <natris1979[m]> oh I know. I'm arguably part of the problem
[22:12:33] <natris1979[m]> but then, my company's product isn't one that people who run something like qutebrowser would ever need. 
[22:13:17] <taeaad> natris1979[m]: Well, we all could be using the same programming language, wear the same bland Nike sweaters, eat only soylent green and have a standard global communicator. So it is, well, arguable.
[22:14:51] <natris1979[m]> that sounds pretty awful.
[22:17:00] <taeaad> Or conversely, if it's about efficiency rather than standardisation then plants would score around 3% efficiency as solar panels. So reducing things (like plants or humans) to some arbitrary metric (like job usefulness) is rather harmful. The plants never intended to be scored based on energy use. Their use of water is more relevant and interesting. In any case, I digress :)
[22:17:38] <taeaad> In any case, my point was just that in fact the "standardisation" of web use via a browser is in fact the opposite: diverse.
