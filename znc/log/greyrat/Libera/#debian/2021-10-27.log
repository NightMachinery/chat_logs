[16:51:10] <dob1_> from the description of nginx-full " This metapackage provides a version of nginx with the complete set of standard modules included (but omitting some of those included in nginx-extras)."      so it has to be possible to install them together
[16:51:49] <jelly> dob1_, no, pick one or the other.
[16:52:40] <ampersam> dob1_ neginx_full installs nginx_extra, since nginx_extra needs nginx_full you created a loop where one package you selected tried to install the other.
[16:53:26] <dob1_> I go the error but I am wrong or it was different on buster?

[19:49:32] <Khepra> right so basically "root's encrypted" is an artificial limitation cause by buggy setup
[19:50:06] <tjcarter> Debian's been telling grub its background image is (same device it's already reading /boot from)/usr/share/blah/blah/default.png or whatever
[19:50:12] <tjcarter> at least when that's true.
[19:50:39] <tjcarter> or at least that's the expectation
[19:51:09] <tjcarter> that assumption (that /usr is readable) is invalid to make in the first place.
[19:51:54] <tjcarter> It might be encrypted. But where Grub lives will not be encrypted, which is why the theme should be copied.
[19:52:06] <Khepra> right
[19:52:40] <tjcarter> Workaround is easy: Choose a theme, copy it, and then set your /etc/default/grub.d to use it.
[19:53:05] <tjcarter> But realistically it's more correct for Debian to modify grub to not need that to be done.

[20:24:45] <PMT> I recall seeing someone complain that they were hitting a limit of 256 windows at once or something.
[20:24:56] <PMT> Maybe that was in a single X session.
[20:25:07] <tjcarter> jelly: Are you limited by VTs?
[20:25:13] <XJ8> So far just one, but if I was to have multiple users logged in at once on the same computer, how many can be logged in at once. I wanted to know about a theoretical limit.
[20:25:34] <tjcarter> I think Linux is generally built to only handle 64 of those.
[20:26:17] <n4dir> funny enough i rememberd (unrelated) that e17 had 64 virtual desktops possible (or was it default? rather not)
[20:26:20] <tjcarter> XJ8: as in fast user switching?
[20:26:37] <PMT> X doesn't have to be on a physical VT. One of the neat tricks with X was always not being on the same physical head as the machine you're logged into.
[20:26:41] <jelly> hmm.  Does X even require running off a vc at all
[20:26:57] <XJ8> No, I mean max users at once. I figured if I was to have multiple people be using X11, I could save money with just one machine and hook them all up to it.
[20:26:58] <PMT> jelly: I've got X running on a machine with 0 VTs, so I'm going with "no"
[20:27:07] <tjcarter> n4dir: virtual desktops are something else. I have 10 of those. Only uses one Xorg seat, one VT, one set of HID devices, etc.
[20:27:14] <PMT> (It's also not Linux at all, so.)

[20:28:05] <tjcarter> n4dir: Lots of virtual desktops?
[20:28:44] <n4dir> yeah. Well, to me the back default 4 seemed pretty good. But more than 20 ? that seems a bit weird
[20:28:50] <XJ8> Because thinking long term if I was to expand how many people would be using linux. 10, 50, or 100 people using one machine would be far more economic than having 10, 50, or 100 different machines to keep updated.
[20:29:09] <XJ8> Unless 100 is just too many
[20:29:18] <PMT> jelly: I don't think this thing exposes any serial consoles
[20:29:19] <tjcarter> n4dir: I have a desktop where I tend to keep terminals (tmux multiplexed) and do some basic file management. I have a VT where I keep several communication apps fullscreened—switch between them as needed. And I have several desktops where I keep a bunch of fullscreen browsers.

[21:24:26] <tjcarter> Branches (things like libs) are a little tougher to do safely because unless they're PART of Debian, they could interfere with how Debian works. So … recommend sticking your libs in /opt or something.

[21:37:57] <tjcarter> It had a Debian checkbox to include significant amounts of profanity in the email. 🤣
[21:38:46] *** aqua is now known as kish`
[21:39:01] <tjcarter> (Bruce was the Pixar guy, and he's famous for rage quitting orgs that he feels no longer align with his ideals. And none with more volatility than Debian which he quit more than once…)
[21:39:12] <sney> tjcarter: I guess LMDE as it stands is an odd duck, since ubuntu/mint/etc users who want a more debian-like experience will usually just switch to debian.
[21:39:40] <at0m> https://wiki.debian.org/ToyStory
[21:40:04] <tjcarter> sney: Unfortunately Debian is missing a few bits of Mint's polish and glue. Some of them we'd do differently, but they're nice to have and I do wish we had them.
[21:40:50] <somiaj> doesn't mint include non-free firmware a little more liberally too?
[21:41:03] <sney> yes afaik
[21:41:11] <tjcarter> sney: Mint has a tool, for example, that will look for hardware on your system that might work better (or at all) if you installed something non-free. Debian wouldn't dream of it, but the Mint tool is really handy for users who have hardware in that category.
[21:41:16] <at0m> somiaj: does anyone do it more strict than debian? :>
[21:41:32] <somiaj> at0m: any distro endorsed by the fsf (which debian is not)
[21:41:36] <sney> ,i isenkram
[21:41:37] <judd> Package isenkram (misc, optional) in bullseye/amd64: Suggest packages to install when inserting new hardware (GUI popup). Version: 0.48; Size: 16.9k; Installed: 56k
[21:41:37] <PMT> tjcarter: Debian does have that, actually.
[21:41:40] <sney> ^ this thing
[21:41:55] <sney> it's new and not shipped by default anywhere though, afaik
[21:42:22] <sney> debian continues to struggle with the firmware issue, since it's obviously not DFSG-free, but is more and more required for normal operation on common systems
[21:42:52] <somiaj> I think the biggest issue is the installer, it is such a pain to provide it additional firmware.
[21:42:57] <tjcarter> somiaj: Firmware, non-free media codecs, a GUI driver tool, better handling of PPAs than Ubuntu has (I've already stated my opinion about PPAs' potential to break things, but it is useful at times), a script that uploads clean inxi output to termbin for support, etc.
[21:43:13] <somiaj> even if you have the firmware file or .deb, it needs to be on its own usb stick (not another partition on the installer stick) for it to even be detected.
[21:43:48] <sney> when I submitted the new debian.org/download page, a few people suggested having the firmware iso be the default
[21:43:58] <sney> I chose not to open that can of worms but at least one of those people was a DD
[21:44:21] * tjcarter still wants an option in the installer menu for the GUI to use a dark theme and/or larger fonts.
[21:44:27] <somiaj> Yea, or at least make it clear it is there, also the download page shouldn't start a download automaticlaly...*gripes about that*

[21:46:12] <tjcarter> Again my quest to darkmode the world 😉
[21:46:45] <sney> there are a lot of big changes that would benefit the website, and a lot of open bugs that fell victim to scope creep a while ago because "fix this thing" turned into "fix everything" and then nothing happened
[21:47:18] <sney> download.wml isn't perfect, but it's roughly the same as a lot of other distros' download pages, so with that we've joined the world of 2010
[21:47:48] <sney> debian.org behaves pretty well with the dark reader extension, at least.

[22:12:04] <tjcarter> sney: but all of the little sites under it don't necessarily, and darkreader is not suitable for general use because it's an all or nothing all pages solution that OFTEN breaks, making it inferior to a custom CSS (which I've gotten pretty good at writing out of necessity) or better yet, a media query in the CSS.
[22:12:52] <tjcarter> If all of the Debian website used the same CSS, either a single custom CSS or media query in the provided CSS would solve the problem.

[22:37:39] <tjcarter> But those indexes have differnet styling than very similar indexes that appear on another sub-site under debian.org or it would be easy. Hence why it'd be nice if they all used the same CSS. But that's best addressed by styling each in turn. Can't do it all at once or you'll go mad.

[23:44:25] <kittonian> so I can't do the same command with the .not-spam directory
[23:44:30] <PMT> what does it do, and that sounds like a problem with rm, not find?
[23:44:47] <kittonian> it deletes anything in that directory that is at least 1 day old
[23:44:54] <Khepra> maybe "doesn't work" needs more explanation
[23:44:58] <Khepra> !doesn't work
[23:44:58] <dpkg> "Doesn't work" is a vague statement.  Does it sit on the couch all day long?  Does it procrastinate doing the dishes?  Does it beg on the street for change?  Please be specific!

[23:45:02] <PMT> kittonian: let me be more clear. "what does it do instead of work"
[23:45:05] <kittonian> doesn't work = doesn't delete anything
[23:45:16] <kittonian> nothing, just returns to a command prompt
[23:45:23] <kittonian> there is no output of that command
[23:45:27] <ede> do an echo instead of rm first to see what it does with it
[23:45:32] <kittonian> it either does what it's supposed to do or it doesn't
[23:46:06] <Khepra> btw, rm -f   won't delete directories without -r
[23:46:16] <PMT> Khepra: -type f
[23:46:19] <Khepra> so if you're only deleting files  (and you are, -type f)  use -delete

[23:46:40] <Khepra> find <options> -delete
[23:47:37] <kittonian> putting echo before the rm does not return anything
[23:47:56] <PMT> that sounds like there are no files matching the criteria. What about if you drop the mtime?

[23:48:09] <kittonian> and no, i don't want to drop the mtime
[23:48:14] <Khepra> maybe you mean -time -1   ?
[23:48:15] <kittonian> that would delete everything in that dir
[23:48:23] <PMT> kittonian: drop the mtime for echoing.
[23:48:36] <kittonian> remember, the command works just fine for the .spam directory, just not the .not-spam directory

[23:49:17] <Khepra> the dash in path is red herring here

[23:49:35] <Khepra> +1
[23:49:52] <Khepra> I hates the hacky {} \; of -exec
[23:50:13] <alkisg> So if you rename server/.spam to server/.spam-with-dash, `find` won't find files inside that anymore? I.e. did you try in the same directory to make sure the problem is related to the dash?
[23:50:23] * kveroneau agrees with Khepra.
[23:50:31] <alkisg> (use echo, not rm of course)
[23:50:32] <kittonian> interesting
[23:50:46] <kittonian> removing the mtime with the echo command does return both files that are in that directory
[23:50:54] <kittonian> but one is 5 days old and the other is from today
[23:51:02] <kittonian> doesn't make any sense
[23:51:10] <Khepra> kittonian: -mtime 1  means _exactly_ 24
[23:51:21] <Khepra> see the -atime tidbit in the manpage
[23:51:22] <kittonian> i don't think so
[23:51:30] <kittonian> -mtime 1 means at least 1 day old
[23:51:34] <Khepra> no
[23:51:44] <Khepra> read the section right under "TESTS"
[23:51:51] <kittonian> i have
[23:51:53] <Khepra> +n -n and n   are things for -atime and -mtime

[23:52:02] <Khepra> "n     for exactly _n_"
[23:52:38] <Khepra> "at least" 24 hours old means  24+ hours old, thus +1   as n is n*24 hours for -mtime
