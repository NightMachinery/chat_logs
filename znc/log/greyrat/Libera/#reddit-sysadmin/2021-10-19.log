[05:22:07] <DoTheNeedful> Quote #290 (U:4/D:-1): → dragonfleas joined   <rpifan> did you come to pay back the car you stole from irc? dragonfleas  [submitted by GIBBY on 2021-05-18 11:25:06 CDT]
[05:22:13] <bloody> how big of a % pay increase?
[05:22:30] <bloody> or did you take the new job for another reason?
[05:22:32] <dragonfleas> 33% increase
[05:22:47] <bloody> that's quite substantial
[05:23:31] <dragonfleas> what charity should i donate to right now
[05:23:41] <dragonfleas> i'm gonna get drunk and donate a massive chunk of money to charity
[05:23:42] <bloody> i always liked wikipedia
[05:24:06] <misspwn> oh wow
[05:24:08] <bloody> wikimedia foundation
[05:24:18] <misspwn> don't donate it to charity, that's your monies
[05:24:38] <misspwn> but if you were gona donate to anything, donate to planned parenthood
[05:24:38] <bloody> yeah you did earn it :)
[05:25:13] <JollyRgrs> dragonfleas: you could pay back some of the people that bought you a new car on IRC
[05:25:26] <dragonfleas> i already bought someone a bunch of pizza
[05:25:33] <dragonfleas> damn it who else wants pizza
[05:25:41] <bloody> lolol
[05:25:47] <bloody> had some for lunch
[05:25:54] <misspwn> you should donate to planned parenthood on behalf of texas and all those who are opposed 
[05:25:59] <misspwn> :D
[05:26:08] <misspwn> they might even send you a sweet sticker
[05:26:20] <SpookyGibby> St Jude's is my charity of choice 
[05:26:35] <misspwn> they're pretty solid too for the kids
[05:27:45] <bloody> if you're in canada there's also the terry fox foundation I think?
[05:28:43] <bloody> it really depends on what you want to contribute towards, there are plenty of charities for various topics, so pick an issue you care about and search up some foundations for it

[06:59:36] <misspwn> hows her FWB gona get up at the same time as her and just peace out without letting her get out the house
[06:59:55] <Jay-Ros> this is pretty much the storyline of one of the Thief video games
[06:59:56] <bloody> yeah that story is as real as wwe wrestling
[07:00:00] <misspwn> everyone telling her to basically grow a spine, i've been in that situation before and it's hellla awkward
[07:00:13] <a1> bloody: how dare you ruin my childhood
[07:00:13] <Jay-Ros> she needs to use the wet arrows to take out the fires in the hallway so the dad doesn't spot her
[07:00:24] <misspwn> like no where to pee but a bottle kinda situation and sneak out
[07:00:27] <Jay-Ros> then she can bludgeon him when he turns around, and drag the body into the linen closet
[07:00:50] <misspwn> looking back though if i would have just gone up the stairs and told everyone peace out they probably would not have even cared

[11:35:23] <Hunterkll> i'm asking why you did that with registry keys an yway
[11:35:30] <sd> 11<g​iraffe> I've read docs on that and as far as i understood that "1" means "ask for password even if the account is part of admin" (I wanted a sudo-like behavior).
[11:35:32] <Hunterkll> instead of opening gpedit.msc and reading each policy's description and options
[11:35:59] <Hunterkll> use local GPO instead of reg keys if you're not on a domain 
[11:36:29] <Hunterkll> (you can copy and paste the policy folder to 'move' the gpo set to another system - or copy it as part of a setup script - later once you have it set right)
[11:36:33] <sd> 11<g​iraffe> Cause Registry at the end of day is where things get changed when you use the various GUI/settings dialogues innit
[11:36:46] <Hunterkll> sure, but the way you did it is unweildly and unmanagable
[11:36:54] <Hunterkll> yes, local group policy when processed sets the right registry keys
[11:37:08] <Hunterkll> but i can just copy the Policies folder to another machine from a completed one instead of having a mile long list of registry key settings

[11:38:39] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> bottom of that list is the ones you're modifying
[11:39:32] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> yea, intead you can just copy and paste a completed C:\Windows\System32\GroupPolicies
[11:39:44] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> then just run gpupdate or reboot
[11:40:24] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> or you can use the LocalGPO utility from SCM (Security Compliance Manager)

[11:46:50] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> @giraffe what you think you want, is really to use a standard user account iwth an alternate destkop admin account
[11:46:57] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> that's how ours is set up
[11:47:03] <sd> 11<g​iraffe> but on linux wheel users do have to type their password when they perform admin actions
[11:47:11] <sd> 11<g​iraffe> like it's default
[11:47:11] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> if i'm logged in as a local admin account, it's click to approve, but no users except a handful have actual local users

[11:47:20] <sd> 11<g​iraffe> yeah
[11:47:24] <sd> 03<V​ardy> If you insist on having user/password everywhere, you're just doing SSO with extra steps since users will end up using the same password everywhere too.
[11:47:24] <sd> 11<g​iraffe> exactly that
[11:47:34] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> @giraffe so why are you logged in as a local admin account to begin with?
[11:47:50] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> Our workstations, if logged in as local admin, just click yes to elevate UAC
[11:47:55] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> local user? Input actual admin credentials
[11:48:01] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> this is, actually, the default windows behavior anyway
[11:48:28] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> that's like saying "i logged in as root and it didn't ask me for a password when i did something"
[11:48:41] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> make a normal user, not an admin, th en UAC acts as sudo does for individual commands/etc
[11:48:49] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> by default
[11:48:55] <sd> 11<g​iraffe> The idea was that "unprivileged account + administrator enabled" = "using administrator with mandatory password when UAC pops up"

[11:49:44] <Joe_Developer> either way it's just typing in the password again
[11:49:52] <Joe_Developer> if someone figures it out that won't stop them
[11:49:58] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> so i log in as normal user hunterkll, and UAC prompt comes up, then I type in d-hunterkll/password to use teh d-hunterkll account which is an administrator

[13:11:22] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> it is in almost 99% of the cases where personal devices are allowed
[13:11:42] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> if you're doing COPE/Fully managed, the device must be brought to IT, factory reset in front of them, a special QR code read, to do full enrollment
[13:12:07] <sd> 11<g​iraffe> And btw a lot of enterprise doesn't allow you to use your own equipment for work stuff, at least here in Italy
[13:12:13] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> BYOD/user owned is the *only* method you can do remotely
[13:12:21] <sd> 11<g​iraffe> You can't bring your own laptop and use it at work

[13:38:05] <xe0n> good one
[13:38:05] <Activ8> get out
[13:38:13] <Joe-Developer> I started photography a fair amount of years ago with a canon 700D then kinda left it for a few years but youtube recommended has been trying to get me back into it
[13:38:14] <Activ8> 😆

[13:38:21] <xe0n> whoever did that is stupid
[13:38:21] <Joe-Developer> my 700d doesnt quite hack it anymore but still
[13:38:45] <Hunterkll> Joe-Developer: past few years before this (like 2015-2020/21ish) I was rocking dual EOS-3 bodies with a series of lenses, so i could carry both black and white and color loadouts at the same time
[13:38:46] <Joe-Developer> was looking at sony's but I have minus money atm
[13:38:54] <Hunterkll> before that I had the EOS 50e (Elan IIe)
[13:39:19] <Joe-Developer> I did have to just google the EOS 50e
[13:39:20] <Joe-Developer> damn
[13:39:21] <Hunterkll> and before that, a Rebel 2000 
[13:39:21] <Joe-Developer> lmao
[13:39:32] <Hunterkll> Rebel 2000 was my first camera 
[13:39:46] <Hunterkll> I also have a Rebel G body i kept in the back as an oh shit emergency spare
[13:39:52] <Hunterkll> in case both my '3s went down for whatever reasons
[13:40:28] <Joe-Developer> very nice :)
[13:40:39] <Hunterkll> EOS-3 was the first canon camera with 48 point autofocus, and the last with eye control focus
[13:40:46] <Hunterkll> best film camera you can get under the EOS-1V
[13:40:58] <Joe-Developer> I mean, honestly
[13:41:05] <Joe-Developer> my iphone 11 takes mint photos
[13:41:18] <Hunterkll> i think it was also the first ETTL-II capable camera, but i'm not sure about that
[13:41:19] <Joe-Developer> It just doesn't shoot in RAW to play with after
[13:41:26] <Joe-Developer> interesting
[13:41:34] <Hunterkll> however, since I jumped to the EOS-3's and have been buying all pro-compatible accessories
[13:41:37] <Hunterkll> lol
[13:41:44] <Hunterkll> all my fucking film camera a ccessories work with the 1D X Mk III

[13:42:41] <Hunterkll> i need a mid-grade dye sublimation printer for making prints before i do that
[13:42:48] <Joe-Developer> with the new M1 pro or m1 max
[13:42:54] <Hunterkll> or a negative exposer thingy so i can use up all my color photo paper
[13:42:55] <Hunterkll> lol
[13:43:05] <Hunterkll> well, to be fair, i still have ab out 200 rolls of film left to develop and scan 
[13:43:06] <xe0n> just go into some schools dark room and use their shit
[13:43:07] <Joe-Developer> I was tempted by a macbook air with the standard M1 coz I can get student discount so it comes to like £700
[13:43:14] <Joe-Developer> just coz of how well the adobe suite works with them
[13:43:14] <xe0n> hey you're like 30, you dont belong here!
[13:43:18] <xe0n> HOLD MY FILM
[13:43:21] <Hunterkll> xe0n: lmfao 
[13:43:35] <Hunterkll> i actually used to do that with the local college i had taken photo courses at till I got my own developing stuff 
[13:43:38] <nobyk> hah the conv with that tech support was hilarious
[13:43:46] <nobyk> laughing so hard
[13:44:04] <nobyk> only good memes plz
[13:44:06] <Joe-Developer> LOL
[13:44:07] <xe0n> you're easily amused
[13:44:23] <Hunterkll> Joe-Developer: but yea, all the accessories are compatible, which is hilarious because my 3's were released mid 1998, and the accessories are compatible all the way back to mid-1989 cameras
[13:44:31] <Hunterkll> at least, in the professional series
[13:44:34] <Joe-Developer> hey
[13:44:36] <Joe-Developer> it's not a bad thing
[13:44:44] <Joe-Developer> means you have to spend less
[13:44:48] <Joe-Developer> just kinda amusing
[13:44:50] <Hunterkll> if you go down to advanced/mid-range you're back to the dumb ass like phonejack plug style shit
[13:44:56] <Hunterkll> instead of the controllable 3 pin connector etc
[13:45:12] <Hunterkll> I still want to get a 1V for film work
[13:45:15] <nobyk> I shouldn't put the /s flag
[13:45:22] <xe0n> should have :D
[13:45:27] <Hunterkll> it'll record in memory all the film settings and let you dump it to a computer
[13:45:32] <nobyk> s/dn't/'ve
[13:45:33] <nobyk> yeah
[13:45:37] <Hunterkll> so you have the exact focal lengths, F stop, light meter data, etc

[13:45:41] <nobyk> no cafeine
[13:45:44] <nobyk> reee
[13:45:44] <Joe-Developer> that's cool
[13:45:45] <Hunterkll> i think the 1V was the first to have any kind of computer hookup 
[13:45:49] <xe0n> coffee first, computers second
[13:45:55] <Hunterkll> 1V came out in 2000 :D

[13:46:08] <nobyk> I'm going through withdrawel rn
[13:46:26] <Hunterkll> Joe-Developer: canon stopped manufacturing the 1V like, in 2015 i think, but were selling remaining stock till 2019, and they're still factory servicing/overhauling them 
[13:46:35] <Hunterkll> though i think at this point i have to mail it to japan for an overhaul if i buy an old one
[13:46:43] <Joe-Developer> yeah most probably
[13:46:52] <nobyk> What's for dinner xe0n 
[13:46:56] <xe0n> japan?! send it there and you'll get a nintendo sent back to you
[13:46:56] <Hunterkll> they basically said "we'll keep servicing this shit until we run out of parts"

[13:55:33] <xe0n> no, follow u!
[13:55:55] <Joe-Developer> damn it 
[13:56:04] <Hunterkll> fufme
[13:56:08] <Hunterkll> classsic early 2000s product
[13:56:30] <Oliber> we still use a logon vbscript to deploy printers, because we have 3 print servers and randomise which is default for "load balancing"
[13:56:34] <Oliber> :(
[13:56:46] <Joe-Developer> well
[13:56:46] <xe0n> just as silly as that dudes script up a bit
[13:56:47] <Oliber> Hunterkll: fits right in a 5.25" bay too!
[13:56:47] <xe0n> nice
[13:56:50] <Hunterkll> snarf
[13:56:57] <Hunterkll> Oliber: hahahahah at least someone remembers
[13:57:07] <Joe-Developer> for our on premise domained machines we have group policy and security groups that map printers
[13:57:09] <Oliber> how could you forget that glorious grey
[13:57:21] <Joe-Developer> but with our azure devices I was trialiing papercut print deploy
[13:57:33] <Joe-Developer> works a treat apart from it didn't print to the main queue that most people use 
[13:57:34] <Oliber> Joe-Developer: on-premisis, on premise means something else
[13:57:42] <Joe-Developer> yeah typing is
[13:57:43] <Joe-Developer> yes
[13:58:05] <Hunterkll> Joe-Developer: we use printerlogic, works pretty well
[13:58:13] <xe0n> on-premises...
[13:58:30] <Joe-Developer> but we already have papercut to manage costs
[13:58:32] <Oliber> was the hypen wrong? i thought it was acceptable
[13:58:32] <xe0n> you need coffee
[13:58:39] <Joe-Developer> makes sense to keep everything in one place
[13:58:43] <Activ8> papercut is nice I used that a long time ago
[13:58:43] <xe0n> on-premisis on-premises
[13:58:47] <Oliber> oh, no second e, yes, i need more coffee

[17:36:49] <CptLuxx> obviouse
[17:37:22] <Hunterkll> lol
[17:37:28] <Hunterkll> the LA problem is purely demand/capacity
[17:37:34] <Hunterkll> it's literally too many orders coming in at once
[17:37:37] <Hunterkll> and no storage etc
[17:37:40] * signofzeta blames Ever Given for some reason
[17:37:42] <Hunterkll> and those trucks move slow as shit because of weight, etc
[17:38:01] <Hunterkll> legitimately this would have happened pandemic or not with this level of traffic coming in. and ship to ship transfers is risky as fuck so ....
[17:38:10] <mistiry> isnt it a combination of surge in demand and shortage of workers?
[17:38:26] <mistiry> i know demand is up like 25% or more from last year
[17:38:34] <Hunterkll> mistiry: well, i mean, storage - ground open and warhouse - is full up - and like, the docks are all full of ships actively unloading, etc
[17:38:37] <mistiry> but i think theres truckers shortage too, and idk about dockworkers
[17:38:38] <Hunterkll> they're working through it but
[17:38:44] <Hunterkll> it's like if you get 1000 tickets all at once
[17:38:56] <Hunterkll> well you'd probably quit but still

[17:39:29] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> the ports of long beach and la are both operating 24/7 now
[17:39:33] <mistiry> i mean, like i said i know that demand (and thus, storage) is a problem

[17:43:31] <Hunterkll> Consumer goods demand is overall 22% higher compared with pre-pandemic levels (comparing February 2020 with August 2021).
[17:43:31] <Hunterkll> The Capital Economics group notes particularly big jumps in imports of toys, games and sporting goods (up 74%), as well as household appliances (up 49%).
[17:43:35] <Hunterkll> that's a fuckin huge ass jump
[17:43:57] <Hunterkll> mistiry: oh yea and they're fuckin crazy record high stacking containers too compared to normal 
[17:44:24] <Hunterkll> so it can be called a staffing shortage - which there is - but when you normally have X staff for Y sized loads, and you still have about X staff......
[17:44:29] <Hunterkll> but you now have Z sized loads
[17:44:29] <int0x1C8> there was a dramatic increase in customs paperwork for UK shipments, and a lot of logi providers (especially the small ones) had to suddenly implement tech and procedures for end to end tracking they'd never had to bother with before

[23:17:46] <sintax> my kid is 6, no shot for him. and no mask mandate
[23:17:53] <signofzeta> yeah, but it's a middle school.  Only eighth-graders are eligible for vaccines, and with parental approval.
[23:17:57] <sintax> besides a 6 year old has less that like a .01% of dying
[23:18:27] <signofzeta> i hear it's worse for kids, but the district hasn't had any deaths (though plenty of cases, teachers and students alike -- including my wife)
[23:18:27] <bloody> over millions of childrens, that's a lot
[23:18:38] <sintax> yeah but natural immunity works too
[23:18:55] <sintax> I heard in teh UK for the kids they're doing covid parties.
[23:18:56] <signofzeta> you know what's a more effective COVID deterrent than a mask? Child-sized coffins.
[23:19:02] <sintax> like parents used to do back in the day with chicken pox
[23:19:12] <signofzeta> before we developed a chicken pox vaccine
[23:19:17] <sintax> yup
[23:19:22] <signofzeta> I had chicken pox in high school. It sucked getting it that late.
[23:19:27] <sintax> i bet
[23:19:30] <sintax> i had it as a kid.
[23:19:36] <sintax> only bad thing to watch out for now is shingles. 
[23:19:48] <sintax> but i'm not worried about my kid. he's not immunocompromised in any way. 
[23:19:58] <sd> 03<H​urdyGurdyBurdy> my family has fuck all idea if I got it or not so i'm up in the air when it comes to the pox
[23:19:59] <signofzeta> does shingles affect young people? I thought only old people had to watch out for that.
[23:20:51] <signofzeta> she and my FIL were both vaccinated.  she was a little sick from Delta.  he was bedridden for days but pulled through, though he still can't taste everything two months later (it's improving)
[23:20:59] <SpookyGibby> yes
[23:21:33] <sintax> when i had the rona i slept on the couch for 2-3 nights because i couldn't breathe laying down. kept chocking on snot
[23:21:36] <signofzeta> I'll ask my doctor when I see her.  Even long before COVID, I used to ask for extra vaccines, because I'm a man, and when I get sick, I act like a huge baby (I'm told).
[23:21:43] <SpookyGibby>  in rare occurrences it can surface in people in their twenties 
[23:21:46] <sintax> lol
[23:22:20] <signofzeta> i'm not immunocompromised, but I have asthma, so COVID and flu could be pretty damn bad.
[23:22:31] <signofzeta> last time I had the flu, though, I could breathe.  I just barfed a lot.
[23:23:15] <JollyRgrs> chicken pox/shingles can make a man go sterile
[23:23:26] <signofzeta> yikes
[23:23:27] <JollyRgrs> just to throw that out there
[23:23:36] <JollyRgrs> yeah, you really don't want to get it post-puberty
[23:23:59] <JollyRgrs> and shingles is basically just "adult chicken pox"
[23:24:00] <signofzeta> well, I've had pox, I got my flu shot and COVID shots, same for meningitis and tetanus.  I'll ask my doctor about shingles.
[23:24:25] <JollyRgrs> idk if you need shingles vax if you've had the pox... i should ask mine, too
[23:24:29] <sintax> i had my vaccines as a kid. probably due for tetanus again. never had a flu shot.
[23:24:33] <JollyRgrs> my grandma had shingles, was not fun
[23:24:41] <sintax> my dad had shingles. it looked like fun...
[23:24:46] <sd> 14<K​illnine> You can get shingles regardless of having chicken pox
[23:24:47] <sintax> and by fun it sucked donkey balls
[23:24:56] <sd> 14<K​illnine> My dad had shingles in his eye, it was awful
[23:24:56] <JollyRgrs> also if you only had a mild case of chicken pox... you aren't in the clear as far as shingles, either
[23:24:58] <sintax> @Killnine with the good news lol
[23:25:07] <sintax> i remember having but not if it was bad or not. 
[23:25:11] <sd> 14<K​illnine> He had shingles twice because he didn't get the vaccine after the first time
[23:25:12] * sintax shrugs
[23:25:19] <signofzeta> dude, my grandma got COVID in March 2020.  she was isolated in a plastic-barriered room, not even allowed to use the sink, because we didn't know then if sending virus down the drain was safe.
[23:25:29] <JollyRgrs> i had chicken pox right after christmas, so i got an extra week of Christmas vacation with my toys... passed it to my sister so she had it for her birthday
[23:25:29] <sintax> jesus
[23:25:39] <sintax> JollyRgrs: that's a good brother!
[23:25:40] <signofzeta> I know she got her shingles shot.
[23:25:42] <sintax> lo
[23:25:45] <sintax> lol
[23:26:18] <signofzeta> 91 years old, and beat COVID Alpha.  Granted, it took her three weeks, a ventilator, and now she has heart disease from out of nowhere -- but she's tough.

[23:27:54] <sintax> my grandparents both late 80's had covid. down a couple days and then fine.
[23:27:58] <sintax> then went and got the vaccine.
