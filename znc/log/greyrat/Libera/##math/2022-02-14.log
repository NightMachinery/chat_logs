[00:50:23] <joel135> gurkenglas: the closest thing i know of is what's called "interlacing"
[00:52:37] <gurkenglas> This?? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interlacing_(bitmaps)
[00:53:00] <CuriousErnestBro> Ax = lx, does this hold? x'A = lx?
[00:53:03] <CuriousErnestBro> and why
[00:55:15] <joel135> more like this https://people.orie.cornell.edu/dpw/orie6334/Fall2016/lecture4.pdf
[00:56:56] <joel135> see also https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2261509/relationship-between-two-cauchy-interlacing-formulas which i answered now
[00:57:09] <gurkenglas> heh thanks.
[00:58:19] <PlanckWalk> CuriousErnestBro: What does that even mean?
[00:58:53] <joel135> :)
[00:58:56] <CuriousErnestBro> PlanckWalk l is eigenvalue of A and x is the corresponding eigenvector
[00:58:59] <PlanckWalk> Does the quote represent a transpose?
[00:59:02] <CuriousErnestBro> yes
[00:59:10] <PlanckWalk> In which case the dimensions are all wrong
[00:59:14] <CuriousErnestBro> i knokw
[00:59:20] <CuriousErnestBro> but the prof still writes it down
[00:59:25] <PlanckWalk> So the equality can't possibly hold.
[00:59:34] <gurkenglas> PlanckWalk, what dimensions dont match?
[00:59:37] <CuriousErnestBro> normally it's Ax = lx
[00:59:55] <CuriousErnestBro> gurkenglas one is a row vector and the other column
[01:00:14] <PlanckWalk> Now  x^T A = l x^T  might hold
[01:00:21] <gurkenglas> ah, so he probably means - yes, that
[01:01:28] <PlanckWalk> In which case yes, just tranpose both sides
[01:01:32] <CuriousErnestBro> actually the expression looks like x'Ay = lx'y
[01:01:48] <CuriousErnestBro> where y is another vector of the same dimension
[01:01:52] <PlanckWalk> Oh wait, is A symmetric?
[01:02:12] <CuriousErnestBro> probably, A is actually XX'
[01:02:33] <CuriousErnestBro> where X is some data matrix
[01:02:37] <CuriousErnestBro> I think XX' is symmetric no matter the X
[01:02:56] <gurkenglas> then yes. You can go from Ax=lx to (Ax)'=(lx)' to x'A'=x'A=lx'
[01:03:05] <PlanckWalk> Aha, then yes, just transpose both sides.  x^T A = x^T A^T = (A x)^T = (l x)^T = l x^T
[01:03:12] <gurkenglas> (XX')'=X''X'=XX'
[01:03:54] <CuriousErnestBro> ohhhh
[01:04:08] <CuriousErnestBro> he does the transpose but you don't see it because of symmetry
[01:05:12] <gurkenglas> ((1 1) (0 0))(1 0)'=1*(1 0)' but (1 0)((1 1) (0 0)) = (1 1) so it doesn't hold for all A.
[01:06:44] <confuzeus> bs. Ax=lx is a linear system

[02:14:33] <CuriousErnestBro> how does the lagrangian optimization work
[02:14:34] <CuriousErnestBro> i dont get it
[02:15:15] <joel135> so it is a sum of rank-1 matrices, and actually each term represents an edge of the graph
[02:15:26] *** Joins: dsrt^ (~dsrt@50.235.176.163)
[02:16:10] <joel135> each term is a sort of "pulling the vertices closer" or making them "more strongly associated"
[02:19:04] <tomeaton17> what is d?
[02:19:24] <joel135> you can also use the graph laplacian to formulate an equation of heat spread. this enables you to ascribe physical intuition to it
[02:20:03] <tomeaton17> joel135 I have seen this heat spread example before, but I didn't understand its relation to laplacian
[02:20:50] <joel135> d is a linear transformation from formal linear combinations of vertices to formal linear combinations of edges

[06:01:34] <auk> hi channel
[06:02:12] <auk> the derivative of 3e^x = 3e^x ...is that right?
[06:03:34] <auk> when i put into wxmaxima y=3e^x, and use the differentiate feature, it returns 3*e^x*log(e)
[06:03:59] <XCode> d/dx(e^x) = e^x
[06:04:03] <auk> is this a bug in wx/maxima or am I missing something?
[06:04:29] <XCode> I think so
[06:05:01] <XCode> e^{x * log(e)} = (e^log(e))^x
[06:05:27] <XCode> oh I guess by log(e) they mean ln
[06:05:55] <auk> hmm, it seems to differentiate y=e^x ...as... e^x*log(e)
[06:06:00] <Z-module> I bet the call the function exp(x) rather than e^x
[06:06:06] <Z-module> they*
[06:06:14] <XCode> it is correct auk
[06:06:17] <XCode> they just write it weird
[06:06:30] <auk> XCode, it's correct if its a natural log?
[06:06:41] <XCode> not natural log but ln
[06:06:47] <XCode> I think by log they mean ln
[06:06:56] <XCode> like log_{e}
[06:07:00] <Z-module> "log" is often taken to mean natural log, especially by pure-math typse
[06:07:03] <auk> i thought "ln" meeant natural log
[06:07:05] <isekaijin> auk: It's just treating “e” as an arbitrary variable, rather than the mathematical constant e = 2.7182818284...
[06:07:16] <auk> isekaijin, ohhhhh
[06:07:29] <Z-module> put it in as  3*expx)   instead
[06:07:48] <Z-module> 3*exp(x)

[06:08:28] <XCode> why do they write it like that though

[06:17:09] <auk> ok so now if i understand correctly,  since ln(e)=1, with maxima's strange notation, it's basically just returning 3e^x
[06:17:31] <auk> but for some reason it wants to tack on the ln(e) onto the end
[06:17:43] <isekaijin> auk: If Maxima treated e as the mathematical constant e, then it would have omitted the factor ln(e) from the answer.
[06:17:58] <isekaijin> It's clearly just treating e as an arbitrary variable.
[06:18:37] <isekaijin> *You* know that e means the mathematical constant e. Maxima doesn't know. Or, more precisely, it's not programmed to treat e this way.
[06:19:24] <dTal> use %e
[06:19:54] <auk> isekaijin, ok I think I'm starting to understand. For a^x, then the to take the derivative you would multiply by the log...
[06:20:14] <auk> and it's just coincidence that in the case of e, its properties cause it to evaluate to 1
[06:20:44] <isekaijin> What I'm saying is... for Maxima, the letter “e” doesn't denote the mathematical constant e.
[06:20:51] <dTal> use %e
[06:20:53] <isekaijin> ^
[06:21:24] <auk> dTal, that seems to work! thank you

[10:41:31] <Galois> your proof doesn't count as a proof in my view since you don't justify any of your steps
[10:41:55] <a3> what do you mean not justify?
[10:42:05] <Galois> justify means cite a theorem preferably by theorem number and book citation

[10:42:26] <a3> there is no theorem it is just a u sub
[10:42:35] <Galois> of course it's a theorem
[10:42:40] <Galois> u substitution comes from a theorem somewhere
[10:42:47] <Galois> if you check carefully that theorem, you will likely find your mistake
[10:42:58] <a3> do you see the mistake?

[10:45:20] <Galois> however, I'll get you started. Here is a possible statement of whatever theorem you're using: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integration_by_substitution#Definite_integrals
[10:45:36] <Galois> note VERY CAREFULLY: the statement requires a **real-valued function**
[10:46:14] <Galois> there is, of course, a reason for this requirement. As you have observed, things go wrong otherwise.
[10:47:09] <Galois> now, if you treat u-substitution as just a symbol trick instead of as a mathematical statement, it's not obvious why you need a real-valued function. The symbol trick works just as well over complex numbers as over real numbers.

[10:47:41] <a3> oh i didnt know it didnt apply to complex functions

[10:50:17] <Galois> further complicating matters is that u-substitution *sometimes* works over the complex numbers, and is sometimes useful, and so you want to be able to use it over the complex numbers. To do this, you need to know when it is correct and when it is incorrect.

[14:34:40] <bildramer> sort by color, so you have 3 red, 22 nonred, then you're asking "pick 5 randomly without replacement, what's the chance you pick all 3 of the first group"
[14:34:48] <bildramer> or vice versa with 5-20 and 3

[14:35:15] <bildramer> which is easier, it's 1/5 * 4/19 * 3/18

[14:40:00] <kmh> how does the independence exactly figure in?
[14:40:01] <bildramer> sometimes I think I should bite the bullet of not auto-simplifying fractions but it's just so satisfying
[14:40:07] <int-e> Yeah if all 3 of the red cars are Diesels then you're less likely to end up with only 5 diesels in total than with lower numbers.
[14:40:29] <int-e> kmh: by assuming that diesels are just as likely to be red as the other cars
[14:40:41] <bildramer> kmh: if red was correlated with diesel, you'd get higher chances, else lower, also it would be way more complicated to calculate
[14:41:07] <kmh> hmmm
[14:41:30] <bildramer> in the extreme, "all red cars are diesel" or "all diesel cars are red" or such things could happen
[14:42:15] <bildramer> dependence can also be complicated and not visible (not in this example)
[14:42:59] *** Joins: NEYi (~NEYi@109.251.216.38)
[14:44:05] <int-e> Otherwise we'd be dealing with probabilities like C(5,2)*C(20,1)*p^2*(1-p)^3*q*(1-q)^19 (for 2 out of the 5 diesels being red, where p is the probability of a diesel being red and q the probability of some other car being red)
[14:44:48] <int-e> But with p=q all those probability terms are equal to p^3(1-p)^22 and cancel out
[14:45:07] <bildramer> yeah maybe I overstated the complexity a bit
[14:45:56] <kmh> int-e,  yes i was getting stuck in there
[14:45:58] <int-e> (hmm, by "probability term" I mean the "p^2*(1-p)^3*q*(1-q)^19" part)
[14:46:10] <int-e> (not sure what a good name for that is)
[14:46:50] <kmh> and wondering also whether they are looking for a conditional probability
[14:46:54] <int-e> Anyway, that p = q is the assumption of independence.
[14:48:18] <cadmio> I've put the "difference of Powers Formula" in the page related to Ruffini's theorem but I'm not sure it is related eq. 5.4.2 https://gioretikto.github.io/mat/algebra/ruffini.html
[14:49:53] <kmh> so here i'm essentially just computing the probability to pick 3 diesel cars (out of the 25 and 5 diesel setting)
[14:51:53] <int-e> For p != q there's still some cancellation, but even so it's ugly: C(5,3)(p(1-q))^3 / (C(5,3)(p(1-q))^3 + C(5,2)C(20,1)(p(1-q))^2((1-p)q) + C(5,1)C(20,2)(p(1-q))((1-p)q)^2 + C(20,3)((1-p)q)^3)

That was also proof based, just much more constrained thematically (until I dropped out for other reasons, we basically only had linear algebra and, within that, only

[19:57:09] <Z-module> You were saying that "Ruffini's theorem" (for a field F,  f(x) nonconstant in F[x], then for any c in F,  f(c) = 0  iff  (x - c) | f(x)  in F[x] --  just called the Factor Theorem when I learned it) is relevant to  x - y  dividing  x^n - y^n  in any commutative ring like Z. But for this you need to coefficient field F to be all of Q(y), not just Z[y].  The division algorithm that powers Ruffini requires being over a field.

[19:59:34] <greenbagels> Yeah I know that as the factor theorem, maybe ruffini has a famous proof
[20:00:21] <cadmio> in that formula appears the factor (x-y) and y seems a root of f(x) = x^(n + 1) − y^(n + 1) so you could divide f(x) by (x-y) by Ruffini
[20:00:58] <riv> it's a lovely identity
[20:01:07] <riv> and you can even discover it yourself very easily
[20:01:12] <Z-module> cadmio, Ruffini needs a coefficient *field* to be true.
[20:01:16] <riv> starting with x^n - y^n it's easy to spot x = y gives a root
[20:01:21] <riv> therefore you can long divide by (x - y)
[20:01:25] <Z-module> so your coefficient field needs not just y in it, but also 1/y

[22:02:29] <somiaj> You don't really need to change to polar coordinates to show that limit doesn't exist. Just look at two paths, such as y=0 and x->inf, gives 0*e^(-x^2) -> 0, while going to infinity on the line x=-y gives -y^2 e^0 -> inf
[22:02:31] <tusko> Is it a valid technique, when performing the limit comparison test, to take logs of the numerator and denominator inside the limit and absolute value signs?
[22:03:14] <remii> somiaj Yea that's way easier, I mean I don't get any further with this http://mathb.in/70632
[22:03:23] <remii> Since I have \theta as a parameter
[22:04:14] <somiaj> tusko: Don't quite follow, you mean when computing limit as n->inf a_n/b_n, they are using logarithims to compute that limit?

[22:06:10] <remii> isekaijin O really?
[22:06:11] <isekaijin> Well, not what you *need* to do, but it's a viable strategy.
[22:06:20] <tusko> somiaj, yes, say, a_n = n^log_n(n^3) and b_n = n^log_5(n^2)
[22:06:51] <tusko> they are taking logs inside of that limit to drop the n base, then use rules of logs to simplify and ultimately a change of base to solve the limit.
[22:07:06] <isekaijin> remii: Yeah, you put it in polar coordinates, treat theta as a constant, and take the limit. Essentially, you're taking a “path to infinity” along a line passing through the origin.
[22:07:19] <tusko> It seems legit to me, but somehow I get the feeling its not legit.
[22:07:56] <remii> isekaijin What I actually tried to do before was to compare with a r^2, since r^2 >= r^2|\cos(\theta)||\sin(\theta)|..

[22:08:06] <somiaj> tusko: This really has nothing to do with the limit comparision test, and just the computation of limits
[22:08:15] <remii> isekaijin At least that was my argument
[22:08:47] <isekaijin> remii: Anyhow, what somiaj suggested is simpler. Consider the lines x = y and x + y = 0.
[22:09:00] <tusko> somiaj, well it is comparing the limit of the ratio of two sequences as their inputs go to infinity
[22:09:00] <isekaijin> If the original limit exists, then the limits along those lines also exist and are equal.
[22:09:36] <somiaj> tusko: sure, part of the limit comparision test is to take the limit, but what you are asking is specificlly about computing a limit (and not the test)
[22:10:47] <isekaijin> remii: So we are taking lim_{|x| -> inf} x^2 e^(-4x^2) [for the line x = y] and lim_{|x| -> inf} (-x^2) e^0 [for the line x + y = 0].
[22:10:59] <tusko> The interpretation of the result would be thus. If the limit is a finite constant, then a_n is growing asymptotically at about the same rate as b_n. If the limit is 0, then b_n is growing faster than a_n. An inifinite limit implies a_n is growing much faster than b_n asymptotically.
[22:11:17] <somiaj> tusko: so is your question that lim n->inf a_n/b_n = lim n->inf log(a_n)/log(b_n)? If so there are examples to show that is false (lim n->inf n^2/n^3 = 0 while lim n->inf log(n^2)/log(n^3) = 2/3)
[22:11:33] <remii> isekaijin Yep. I'm just trying to see how it would be done with polar coordinates. For example, this one was pretty easy to see that it tends to 0. http://mathb.in/70634
[22:11:54] <isekaijin> Okay, then let me try.
[22:12:02] <somiaj> tusko: yes I know the limit comparision test, I'm just trying to identify what your actual question is, and to me it appears to be about just computing the limit, not the test
[22:12:22] <tusko> somiaj, so then what is the proper way to simplify those logs of different bases I guess?
[22:12:38] <tusko> I believe you that we can't take the log inside the limit. Your proof convinced me.

[22:15:42] <somiaj> tusko: change of base, you have a_n = n^log_n(n^3) = n^3, and b_n = n^log_5(n^2) = n^(log_n(n^2)/log_n(5)) = n^(2/log_n(5))
[22:16:17] <somiaj> tusko: so then a^n/b^n = n^3 / n^(2/log_n(5)) = n^(3 - 2/log_n(5))

[22:20:01] <isekaijin> remii: I thought your exponent was (x + y)^2.

[22:25:00] <remii> isekaijin Like I did here http://mathb.in/70636
[22:25:07] <isekaijin> What you need is an upper bound on se^(-s).
[22:25:28] <isekaijin> Since e^(-r^2) tends to 0, if se^(-s) had an upper bound, then we would be done.
[22:25:53] <isekaijin> Errr, I mean |se^(-s)|, wrapped in an absolute value.
[22:26:06] <isekaijin> If |se^(-s)| were bounded, then the original limit would be 0.
[22:26:10] <isekaijin> By the squeere theorem.
[22:26:13] <isekaijin> squeeze*
[22:26:41] <isekaijin> But |se^(-s)| is NOT bounded, alas.
[22:27:44] <isekaijin> remii: By taking t = -pi/4, we have s = r^2 sin(-pi/2) = -r^2.

[23:13:15] <Z-module> That's the great thing about general generating functions: they all make sense in rings such as R[[x]] or C[[x]], no convergence issues at all. It found it immensely freeing when I first learned that.
[23:14:27] <greenbagels> Z-module: right
[23:14:41] <greenbagels> now here's a question: how common is it to manipulate them into a form where it finally makes sense to think about convergence
[23:14:53] <greenbagels> and then turn the formal power series into an actual power series

[23:15:14] <XCode> how does intersection distribute over direct sum?
[23:15:20] <XCode> it is only 1 component right?
[23:15:47] <XCode> just making sure so that my calculations is correct
[23:15:57] <greenbagels> because, to me, a probability-generating function seems just as "free" as a typical generating function, until you realize that, if it converges, taking derivatives is immensely useful for calculating pdfs and moments and all that
[23:16:41] <int-e> XCode: for this purpose, the direct sum is just a cartesian product, isn't it? So you have (A n B) x C = (A x C) n (B x C)
[23:16:58] <XCode> right

[23:48:01] <isekaijin> remii: Okay, I see. The problem is that s = xy doesn't converge to any specific value.
[23:48:27] <isekaijin> You can define a path along which x^2 + y^2 grows without bound, and xy converges to any value of your liking.

[23:50:34] <isekaijin> (Of course, for c = 0, the hyperbola becomes degenerate. It becomes a pair of lines. But that doesn't affect the remainder of the argument.)
[23:51:10] <isekaijin> remii: Then you can define a path in this hyperbola, along which x^2 + y^2 becomes arbitrarily large.
[23:51:21] <isekaijin> And yet xy remains constant and equal to c.
[23:51:34] <isekaijin> remii: So far so good?

[23:53:02] <isekaijin> If you make, say, y very small, then x will become very large.
[23:53:13] <isekaijin> So x^2 + y^2 will be similarly very large.

[23:54:15] <remii> Yea
[23:54:25] <isekaijin> So that's where I get x^2 + y^2.
[23:54:57] <remii> isekaijin I will be honest I'm a bit lost when it comes to hyperbolas.
[23:55:03] <isekaijin> What?
[23:55:14] <isekaijin> Fix a constant c and draw the curve xy = c in R^2.

[23:56:17] <isekaijin> If c = 0, then this curve will be the union of the X and Y axes.
[23:56:30] <isekaijin> If c > 0, then this curve will be a hyperbola with branches in the first and third quadrants.
[23:56:46] <isekaijin> If c < 0, then this curve will be a hyperbola with branches in the second and fourth quadrants.
