[12:37:52] <EdwardIII> and it's mildly interesting
[12:40:01] <goodger> I came from python/django, EdwardIII... that's sorta similar

[14:43:44] <wink> EdwardIII: dunno, my mediocre set of people where I know where they came from did it for different reasons, so not sure how useful the metric is. also what counts as "coming" in the first place, I've never had clojure as my main language, so have I even arrived :P
[14:47:23] <EdwardIII> wink: it's useless, just a curiosity :)
[14:47:43] <wink> yeah. but I didn't see any patterns.
[14:54:31] <yeik-the-spik[m]> I also came from python. It seems to me that the road to Clojure is paved from Java. If you are coming from somewhere else, it's pretty much a dirt road. Does anyone feel similar, or am I an oddball?
[14:56:34] <yeik-the-spik[m]> Well, also toyed with racket and have serious experience with R, which is kinda lispy. Funny, I did metaprogram R a lot, but have never written a lisp macro other than exercises.

[15:57:15] <leah2> why not pass the default arguments in line 77 instead of doing or in 79?

[16:02:13] <Para> That would be userspace pollution.
[16:02:35] <Para> User being a person using the library - from user's point of view the overload is cleaner than always requiring _something_
[16:03:05] <leah2> but "allowing" nil feels icky
[16:03:19] <leah2> i'm not refering to having overloads, i mean where the default value is computed
[16:03:32] <Para> Reading source shouldn't be assumed to be required to understand how a library works either, that's elitist bullshit approach to explaining why one hasn't designed the API properly and/or written documentation for it.
[16:04:10] <Para> Well, when doing overloads only one, usually the most complex/complete one, should have all the logic. That way you don't accidentally create an overload/variant which skips some of the validation.
[16:04:53] <Para> Overloads merely delegate and fill in the gaps.
[16:04:55] <leah2> i dont consider falling back to a default value on nil as validation
[16:04:58] <leah2> but hiding bugs :p
[16:05:17] <Para> nil is a meaningful value in Clojure though

[17:03:07] <sobel> leah2: i consider allowing my program to fail because of a nil to be a bug. default values at least let the program run long enough to explain itself.
[17:04:01] <sobel> this opens up a design choice: default values can intentionally trigger warnings/logs, or defaults can attempt to be useful
[17:08:04] <leah2> i'd prefer a quick crash where nil is used the first time instead of tracing back the logic why the default was applied here

[18:51:35] <EdwardIII> thansk technomancy, andreyorst, wink, yeik-the-spik[m], Para, lunik1 & goodger. all interesting comments i think :) i guess it's true as has been said in here before, generally clojure is another language that gets picked up by a polyglot programmer, so yeah 'come from' is ambiguous. i was thinking about former main professional language (but yeah, again, a fair few aren't using clojure
[18:51:37] <EdwardIII> professionally here but as an interesting hobby thing) 
[18:52:14] <technomancy> EdwardIII: the clojure survey asks this question every year; try that
[18:52:38] <EdwardIII> i was just generally curious but also i think a bit wondering if the whole 'ruby is an acceptable lisp' thing makes ruby > clojure a common transition
[18:53:13] <technomancy> most people I knew who got tired of ruby moved on to node which they then moved on again from pretty quickly
[18:53:17] <EdwardIII> i know matz says he was inspired by lisp and was a big emacs lover (but i guess anyone who is into languages enough to make one is probably inspired by lisp to a ceratin extent. except PHP core devs perhaps) 
[18:53:46] *** Quits: poselyqualityles (~poselyqua@user/poselyqualityles) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[18:53:47] <EdwardIII> yeah, we had to use node on our last big project 5 years ago for funding reasons and it's been a nightmare in many, many respects
[18:54:41] <EdwardIII> we would have got so much more done in another language + ecosystem. actually getting stuff done instead of constantly fighting the libs/package manager/tooling
[18:55:45] <technomancy> I don't know if this is true but I feel like Ruby was one of the more trend-driven communities back in the day so having a lot of those people move on to Node didn't surprise me.
[18:56:23] <technomancy> of course the people who used ruby from before rails never even considered node
[18:56:23] <EdwardIII> this may be an unpopular opinion here but i found rails was pretty good for getting stuff done, definitely compared to node+js+ts
[18:57:23] <technomancy> oh sure; I mean especially at the time the alternatives were mostly dramatically worse
[18:57:42] <technomancy> going up against PHP, J2EE, and Perl mostly
[19:00:33] <EdwardIII> if i was starting a new project today and i had to choose rails or node + express, no other choices, i would likely choose rails again

[19:01:18] <wink> can't wait to move on from whatever tech annoys me and then pick up retirement :P too bad it's another 30y off
[19:01:57] <technomancy> nowadays phoenix seems a lot like rails with 80 or 90% of the bad ideas removed
[19:02:27] <EdwardIII> wink: well you may be able to change jobs in the next 30 years :)
[19:03:14] <EdwardIII> technomancy: yes, it looks interesting. and it also looks like rails is encorporating some ideas from phoenix back into itself too (like liveview > hotwire) 
[19:03:51] <technomancy> well, phoenix is more interesting to me specifically due to bad ideas from rails that it leaves out, so I don't know how much rails can learn from it
[19:04:11] <technomancy> without like ... massively breaking changes
[19:04:17] <EdwardIII> i hear ya
[19:04:24] <EdwardIII> ofc the right answer is 'just use clojure', right? :D
[19:04:43] <technomancy> the right answer is *always* "It depends"
[19:04:52] <EdwardIII> that's not gonna sell blog posts!
[19:04:59] <wink> EdwardIII: I like my current job but I definitely feel less enthusiastic, compared to a decade ago
[19:05:08] <EdwardIII> wink: due to the tech stack? what are you using?
[19:05:14] <wink> also I've not even found the annoying parts yet.
[19:05:36] <wink> Java, Erlang, a little groovy and as usual, bash :P
[19:06:15] <technomancy> obligatory https://i.etsystatic.com/5942665/r/il/a9590d/1204033332/il_794xN.1204033332_andg.jpg
[19:06:45] <wink> hehe
[19:06:46] <EdwardIII> 99% bash :)
[19:09:29] <EdwardIII> modern java seems not so bad 
[19:09:57] <EdwardIII> what i liked about clojure was that it had the java ecossytem, so it felt like i could learn a lisp, but still maybe use it in a practical/professional context
[19:12:15] <wink> I've been doing a lot of migration stuff lately, some people hate it, but I don't mind, really
[19:12:35] <wink> taking old code, writing (new or more) tests, then refactoring
[19:12:53] <wink> then bumping deps and it looks as good as new ;)
[19:15:26] <EdwardIII> you don't mind refactoring/updating? or don't mind modern java?
[19:17:01] <lunik1> People say Clojure gives you access to the Java ecosystem, but I have found it can feel a little clumsy when that Java ecosystem uses mutable containers everywhere
[19:21:24] <EdwardIII> lunik1: yes i can understand that. and with JS + TS we often ahd this impedence mismatch that lead to big pain. but one way i heard it being described was ort of 'use clojure everywhere you can, but drop down into java if you must, a bit like going from C to assembly', mainly for perf stuff. however i've only used clojure in toy projects, so know nothing of the real experience heh
[19:23:48] <EdwardIII> that being said i think i have used (.toString thing) :D
