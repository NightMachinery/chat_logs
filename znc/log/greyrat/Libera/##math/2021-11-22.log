[00:12:46] <XCode> I have a basic question. Let $C$ be a degree two surface in $\mathbb{P}^2 \times \mathbb{P}^2$. That is the polynomial defining $C$ is of degree two. It follows $C$ can be realized as a surface in $\mathbb{P}^8$ by using Segre embedding. Let $H$ be a quadric surface in $\mathbb{P}^8$. Why is it true that $deg(C \cap H) = 36$ points?

[00:51:52] <dude12312414> if F is the splitting field and a is a root of the polynomial, you have the tower F > Q(a) > Q

[02:54:04] <mycroftiv> 3 different questions that arose naturally in mathematics whose answer is contingent on large cardinals at measurable and above:
[02:54:19] <mycroftiv> if you have a topological space that is a normal Moore space, is it always metrizable? does there exist an abelian group A with Ext1(A, Z) = 0 that is NOT a free abelian group? is every homotopy idempotent functor E on simplicial sets equivalent to f-localization for some map f?
[02:56:09] <mycroftiv> The normal Moore space conjecture, the whitehead problem, and something about model categories/Bousfield localization - all are independent of ZFC but proven if we assume existence of a measurable cardinal (or refuted if we axiomatize their non-existence)

[04:20:11] <HenryTheLongshot> Batzy: I don't know. I guess now that I think about it it's kind of obvious. Does this imply birth-death processes are also irreducible? Since the jump chain for a birth death process is a random walk on N?

[04:23:52] <Batzy> so in the case of Z, it was obvious.
[04:24:13] <Batzy> I think the answer to your question is yeah, it should be irreducible
[04:24:35] <Batzy> The other thing is I feel like you have to try harder to come up with a reducible example than an irreducible one
[04:26:22] <HenryTheLongshot> Batzy: makes sense, the only way I can think of for a birth death process to be reducible is if any of the birth or death rates are 0, which creates a gap in the jump chain

[05:28:44] <qergle> noobly: to clarify, the dihedral group of order 8 has 8 elements and is often called D_4 (because it's the symmetries of the square) and sometimes called D_8 for people who use the number to denote order.
[05:32:54] * LouisXIV prefers D_4, mostly for the easons Z-module talked about above, in that it relates to regular n-gons.
[05:34:38] <noobly> Yes, so I am considering the group of order 16 here, which relates to an octogon, if I'm not mistaken. I got a little mixed up as I used the standard notation in a previous class. So this would be D16 then, in the notation preferred here?
[05:34:53] <LouisXIV> One of the first things I go through with a student is to make the multiplication table for D_3, even if the class has nothing to do with that directly.
[05:34:57] <qergle> ok, fine, so D8 (symmetries of octagon)
[05:35:11] <qergle> then yes, the presentation has r^8=s^2=...
[05:36:05] <qergle> and now you can mod out two possible normal subgroups in the hope of getting C_4

[07:56:08] <Samian> [2021-11-07T22:28:51-0700] <PlanckWalk> Layer-at-a-time updates aren't axis-aligned, though.
[07:57:38] <Samian> So, adding to that previous conversation, isn't dropout basically doing the same thing I suggested?  updating one weight or one layer at a time before computing a new error and performing a new backprop/weight-update step is basically the same as having a very high drop out

[08:28:47] <greenbagels> for G/N, elements of N get mapped to the identity; but the rest of the group acts how you expect it to (related to the idea of the natural projection phi: G -> G/N being a surjective homomorphism, so you can always think of operations on quotients being done in the "original space" and then projected onto the quotient)
[08:29:06] <Samian> jmorris  good point

[08:41:23] <qergle> or trying to map, maybe i should say, we don't know if we can yet.
[08:41:43] <noobly> after combing my instructors notes, he clarifies that D8 is meant as the group of symmetries on the square, so it's order 8
[08:41:44] <qergle> because my neck hurts from the back & forth D_4, D_8, D_16
[08:41:52] <noobly> I know, mine too, sorry
[08:42:15] <qergle> ok, so we shall call the symmetries on the square D_8 (dihedral with 8 elements).
[08:42:31] <noobly> agreed
[08:42:50] <qergle> and you want to know if a homomorphism φ exists that maps D_8 onto C_4
[08:43:22] <qergle> said homomorphism must have as kernel one of D_8's normal subgroups, and it must, to make the order match, be an order 2 subgroup. yes?
[08:44:01] <noobly> The cyclic group of order 4, which my book calls 'Z4', but C_4 works if that's what is meant
[08:44:25] <qergle> ok, we'll call it Z_4
[08:44:47] <qergle> Z_4 is from notation of integers under addition mod 4
[08:44:52] <somiaj> Yea, there are various notations for a cyclic group of order 4, Z_4, C_4, or Z/(4Z)

[10:03:01] <mycroftiv> there are actually interesting ways to connect ideas from nonstandard analysis & infinitesimals to quantum theory, this paper https://repository.kulib.kyoto-u.ac.jp/dspace/bitstream/2433/62475/1/1066-16.pdf is one I like
[10:03:54] <somiaj> Samian: Isn't this normally true, as time goes on there are more and more shoulders to stand on
[10:04:22] <somiaj> Samian: I think it is great that all these resources are out there, but they can also be overwhelming, and for math students still need to put in the time figuring things out on their own.
[10:08:20] <pounce> Samian: gen z here, i've had a hard time actually finding good instruction on some subjects on youtube, it's quite unfortunate

[10:11:25] <Samian> oh okay. I guess it's not as positive as I thought
[10:12:04] <greenbagels> i imagine if someone enjoys watching 3b1b but doesn't actually care that much about math in general, they could see his video on the monster group and remember the name, but not remember what a group is
