[01:10:29] <geirha> !tests
[01:10:29] <greybot> Use [[ .. ]] for testing strings or files, (( .. )) for testing numbers, and ''if ..'' for testing commands. Do *NOT* use [ .. ] in bash (only in sh). See <http://mywiki.wooledge.org/tests> and <http://wiki.bash-hackers.org/commands/classictest>. Difference between [ and [[: <http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/031>
[01:11:15] <HelloShitty> So, we use double quotes and dollar sign here?
[01:11:23] <HelloShitty> ok, will change to [[ ]]
[01:11:26] <geirha> because [ is an ordinary command
[01:11:57] <geirha> so any unquoted expansion will be subjected to word splitting and pathname expansion
[01:12:15] <HelloShitty> ok, so with [[ ]] I can drop them?
[01:13:19] <geirha> yes, because [[ ]]Â is a shell keyword and has its own parsing rules
[01:13:50] <geirha> which allows it to do pattern and regex matching, among other things

[03:03:43] <AntonioPt> could it be because file is too big ?

[12:27:33] <osse> soemthing similar to PIPE_STATUS could work I guess
[12:28:04] <Soliton> right, but you couldn't "fix" how $? works. you'd need another interface.

[12:30:00] <osse> ? could be the name of the array :P

[12:30:48] <greybot> "set -e" is an inheritance of the old bourne shell, and doesn't really work well with modern shell features. You'll really have less buggy scripts if you do the error handling manually instead of relying on the unreliable "set -e"; see http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/105

[12:40:27] <Soliton> the point is that if you have set -e enabled then you should disable it and handle errors explicitely as you want not hope that set -e will happen to do the right thing.

[22:14:36] <pj> You don't see it often but nearly every language supports chaining assignments like that.
[22:14:56] <greycat> I am skeptical of that assertion.
[22:15:42] <pj> every language I've worked with, I don't think there would be many that don't support it.
[22:16:33] <greycat> I doubt that even the *majority* of languages support it, let alone "nearly every".
[22:17:31] <pj> At the end of the day assignment operators also output something, like most other operators, so when you do a=b=c what you actually get is a=(b=c) and the output of b=c is the result of the assignment.
[22:17:56] <greycat> You're assuming that all languages use a construct like  x=1  to assign a value to a variable.  This is not the case.
[22:18:08] <greycat> Pascal uses x := 1
[22:18:13] <greycat> Tcl uses set x 1
[22:18:26] <greycat> COBOL uses something like  ASSIGN 1 TO x.

[22:18:33] <cryptonector> tangy: well, it's common, but in sh normally <var>=<val> does not interpret the <val> to look for additional ='s -- it's only when bash knows the <var> is a numeric that it then knows it can (and should) interpret the right-hand side of the assignment
[22:18:35] <pj> hrmmmmm, yeah, it's been that long since I've coded pascal that I didn't even recall the construct.

[22:19:45] <cryptonector> if everything is a string then x=... -> can't parse the RHS because x=y=z -> x="y=z"
[22:20:03] <greycat> that's what you get with a regular variable in any Bourne-family shell
[22:20:29] <pj> and of course in bash x=y=z only works inside (( ))
[22:21:10] <greycat> Well, you need the variables to be treated as "integer type" or for this to be inside a math context.  I'm not sure if setting the -i flag on just one of them would trigger it, or if you would need both.

[22:31:57] <pj> there are many languages that overload + do do different things based on type, eg javascript: var x=1; var y=2; console.log(x+y) will out put something different than: var x="1"; var y="2"; console.log(x+y)
