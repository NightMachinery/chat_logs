[02:05:20] <makani_kai> Aloha. I am dealing with a situation where utf-8 encoded chars have been written to latin1 columns for the past 10 years. I am writing a migration to fix this, which involves first converting the column to binary, then back to varchar/text/whatever but as utf8mb4 instead of latin1, which essentially changes the charset without converting the bytes.
[02:05:20] <makani_kai> On the web I've seen people say I need to be careful and make sure I go from VARCHAR to VARBINARY, or TEXT to BLOB. Why can't I just use BLOB for every column, e.g. VARCHAR -> BLOB -> VARCHAR? It seems to work when I do this, so I'm not sure why people are adamant that I need to do VARCHAR -> VARBINARY -> VARCHAR. (Here's a link explaining it:
[02:05:20] <makani_kai> http://mysql.rjweb.org/doc.php/charcoll#fixes_for_various_cases)
[02:05:20] <makani_kai> Can anyone tell me what pitfalls I could run into?

[02:59:42] <makani_kai> Referring to my earlier messages, I think one problem it would cause is if I used BLOB instead of e.g. LONGBLOB when working with a LONGTEXT field. Anyway I have decided to just follow the advice and use VARBINARY for VARCHAR, etc.

[05:00:59] <Slartibart> Sure. Sometimes I like to kind of juggle things with other people too though, that's all.
[05:01:50] <thumbs> Slartibart: test it yourself now.
[05:04:19] <Slartibart> Yeah, well..as I'm sticking to my previous point :)..: Feel free to elaborate on what it is that you'd like me to discover.
[05:04:33] <Slartibart> (I have already tested it)
[05:06:46] <thumbs> yet you are asking us to confirm your observation? Odd.
[05:08:05] <Slartibart> thumbs: You are missing my point, which was that sometimes people add extra info about the subject which I'd otherwise miss.
[05:08:15] <Slartibart> ..generally speaking.
[05:09:12] <Slartibart> I'm not trying to force anyone to answer :)..
[05:11:15] <thumbs> Slartibart: you cleary used the '?' in the response to the channel, and asked a question that you could trivially test yourself.
[05:12:41] <Slartibart> I'm fairly sure I haven't try to deny that.
[05:12:58] <Slartibart> (The ? part)
[05:13:04] <thumbs> ok, so you tried and you confirmed your theory, we can close your loop
[05:14:36] <Slartibart> If you're calling it a loop you're again missing my point. It was more like fetching info from multiple sources in parallel.
[05:15:06] <Slartibart> (Own testing, this channel and others)
