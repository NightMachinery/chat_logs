[04:15:50] <Gustavo6046> blei23, this requires very good coverage
[04:16:00] <blei23> what do you mean by coverage.
[04:16:01] <Gustavo6046> your program might run and not actually hit every part of the code that uses something from the library
[04:16:14] <Gustavo6046> so it migth use method A and B but not C, if it happens to never run the part that uses C
[04:16:26] <blei23> by definition, when the program runs (for the purposes of the tool)
[04:16:31] <blei23> it touches everything required
[04:16:36] <Gustavo6046> and the watching program will figure that it simply doesn't need C and strip it out of the distributed libraries, causing problems!
[04:16:37] <WormFood> It sounds like he's trying to do it the long way around. There are tools that will only build the parts of the libraries that are actually used.

[05:59:26] <kline> how are the sysctls for ipv6 forwarding supposed to work? i have 3 interfaces, enp1s0, lo, and gemini (a wireguard interface). to route packets between two wg clients that peer with this server, i expected to need to set net.ipv6.conf.gemini.forwarding=1, but that didnt work. setting all.forwarding=1 did work, and {lo,enp1s0,gemini}.forwarding=1 didnt work
[06:00:05] <kline> so at first blush, it appears as though the only setting that matters is the forwarding setting for all, and the per-interface options make no difference either way

[06:04:53] <ayecee> i see one link from 2018 that the trick is to send a ping with the PostUp to each endpoint, in the "The step some of you undoubtedly missed:" https://jrs-s.net/2018/08/05/routing-between-wg-interfaces-with-wireguard/

[10:16:02] <labrador> How do I compile a portable binary tar.gz? Like the ones devs distribute that don't need to install to /usr and runs off the folder

[10:16:56] <jim> well such a binary would probably be compiled with static linking

[16:17:55] <joo-_> maybe autossh is not nescessary at all to keep connection alive
[16:18:05] <peetaur> joo-_: it's not useless...it's useful for killing it to start it again; but I don't know why it's hanging or how to prevent that...it can be many things like network issues. Is it predictable how soon it hangs? can you try just using the ssh client constantly to see if that prevents it dying? if so, either keepalive or maybe that option to make a non-interactive ssh might fix it.

Doing systemctl enable knockd tells me "The unit files have no installation config (WantedBy=, RequiredBy=, Also=, Alias= settings in the [Install] section, and DefaultInstance= for template units). This means they are not meant to be enabled using systemctl.". I've specified
[19:01:36] <zoug> "START_KNOCKD=1" in /etc/default/knockd, but I don't understand how knockd could be started this way if I reboot my machine. And I can't really not have it starting, since I use this port knocking for SSH and don't want to be locked out. Can anyone help me? Thanks a lot

Just want to know some basic principles: i have a webdav storage in the cloud .... i want to mount it locally using davfs, i guess it's called. If i make a dir under /mnt/ as a mount point, i'll make it using sudo. Is there anything i can write on the mount line (i'm using a manual mount command line) to give my regular user write permission in

[20:25:39] <jensen> yes, it would need to be done in intervals so i was thinking a simple ping/curl would be better than calling the scripts. but the scripts can be made to better handle this and i would need to modify the statusbar a bit. for reliability the latter is preferred then i see
[20:25:50] <ananke> jensen: what scenarios are you trying to account for? an easy check would be to query a known web service, and look for expected HTTP return code.

[23:43:10] <boosternath> phogg, I suppose hanlon's razor is appropriate here because the scam - if it were a scam - would not be a very good one. It would depend on people not reporting the broken merchandise to ebay, so it wouldn't run very long. So the ignorance is the more likely explanation by far
