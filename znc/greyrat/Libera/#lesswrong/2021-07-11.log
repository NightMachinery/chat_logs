[00:13:01] <PapuaHardyNet> how sensible is it to use matrix clients with IRC bridges instead of native IRC clients?
[00:14:32] <PapuaHardyNet> because I know a few people who do that, and I find that kind of strange because I consider matrix quite problematic to use. Bloated clients, complicated security mechanisms, and matrix homeservers are resource hogs
[00:15:21] <catern> it's sensible if you're highly tolerant of bad UX, I guess
[00:16:39] <catern> I agree that it's quite strange, Matrix is quite a hassle and there are no good clients (a "good client" to me is only possible if it's in Emacs and good)

[01:04:13] <kuudes> mjr, saturn2, we discussed before if it is reasonable to get oxygenerator in finland. I have processed my thinking a bit. I notice a key worry of mine is that talk has started on "we should base our policy on hospitalizations and deaths instead of cases"
[01:04:22] <kuudes> hospitalizations lag some 14 days after cases
[01:04:42] <kuudes> this means that if we base policy on those, our policy has now been cut off 14 days of reaction time
[01:05:03] <kuudes> so basicly we will allow status quo to carry 2 weeks further, which means 2 exponentiations
[01:05:16] <feep> [22:26] <meowcat> also, i think "bradyzoites" sound like they should have opinions about gun regulation
[01:05:20] <feep> I was thinking sailor moon villain

[01:06:28] <kuudes> ie if our red line was previously "icu at 100", we will now with same red line end up to "icu at 225" instead
[01:06:39] <kuudes> just because of the lag
[01:07:19] <kuudes> basicly we should adjust our red lines by 1/2.25, but I think the system possibly won't manage to do that, if we are talking about multiple random politicians etc
[01:08:19] <kuudes> ie if one proposes our red line should instead be now "icu at 45", they seem likely to get laughed out as a paranoid alarmist

[04:00:24] <SDr> | Ghost Stories was picked up for dubbing by ADV Studios in 2005. According to voice actor Greg Ayres, they were told to "do whatever it took to sell the show." The only condition was that the basic story and names of major characters and ghosts had to remain intact, but everything else was fair game. To that end, director Steven Foster reworked
[04:00:24] <SDr> the show into a pure Gag Dub by throwing out nearly all of the original script. When the voice actors were called in to record scenes, whoever got there first would set the tone and subject for the scene, which meant the other cast members had to follow in those footsteps.

[10:51:45] <feep> is this a crazy person? ^
[10:56:33] <rsaarelm> It's hive, they're always like that.
[11:00:18] <quanticle> Hivewired? Hive is the best kind of crazy.
[11:00:30] <quanticle> (Speaking from having met them in person)
[11:00:39] <quanticle> Also, speaking of crazy: https://github.com/tjdevries/vim9jit
[11:00:40] <Robomot> GitHub - tjdevries/vim9jit: Ok, hear me out. vim9script... but in lua... so fast (Ok, hear me out. vim9script... but in lua... so fast - tjdevries/vim9jit)
[11:00:54] <quanticle> That's right... he's compiling vimscript to Lua so he can optimize it with Luajit
[11:04:01] <rsaarelm> As far as I can figure, Hive's what happens when you see way more of the spinning gears in your head than you're supposed to for a regular healthy blackboxed sense of self, and trying to describe the stuff can get sort of wild.
[11:05:15] <quanticle> I guess that's one way of seeing it; my take is, "Hive is what you get when your average crazy trans person actually manages to stabilize themselves via contact with namespace"
[11:06:32] <saturn2> could someone tl;dr this
[11:06:57] <quanticle> We're too busy tl;dr-ing Hive

[11:12:01] <saturn2> ok
[11:12:28] <saturn2> so there's not really any point?
[11:14:54] <rsaarelm> I'm pretty sure there actually are interesting and difficult-to-introspect cognitive gears below the regular healthy blackboxed sense of self level that would be interesting to have mapped. Not sure how useful a job hive is doing at that.

[11:19:54] <rsaarelm> Actually reading the post now, looks like good stuff to me.
[11:22:32] <feep> rsaarelm: yeah I reread it and it's actually nice and cute
[11:22:46] <feep> it just really pattern matched to crazy at first glance

[11:50:58] <dbohdan> It's a pretty good post, but I think Chapman's _Buddhism for Vampires_, which it draws upon and links to, explains this "eating the shadow" stuff more clearly
[11:53:40] <PapuaHardyNet> oh yeah hivemind's tulpamancy articles were very insightful
[12:01:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> I thought they were crazy
[12:01:38] <Obormot\Arcturus> Hive eventually wrote a post which was like "uh yeah so a lot of what I have thought and written was actually dumb shit, I see that now"
[12:01:45] <Obormot\Arcturus> And, yeah, it was
[12:02:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> So good on them for eventually realizing it
[12:02:25] <dbohdan> I've wanted to try tulpamancy since it became a thing, but I am reluctant because I don't want to break my brain
[12:02:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yes, don't do that
[12:02:57] <Obormot\Arcturus> Just don't do any of this tulpamancy / meditation / enlightenment / LSD / etc. bullshit
[12:02:58] <dbohdan> Especially since there is madness in my blood, as Lovecraft might put it
[12:03:16] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's all just "fuck up your shit to no good effect"

[12:05:00] <Obormot\Arcturus> That's really the biggest and most important positive outcome of the "rationalist" set's current/recent obsession with this stuff
[12:05:22] <Obormot\Arcturus> We have so much data now, so many case studies, so many attempts at investigation
[12:05:40] <Obormot\Arcturus> We have more than enough - way, way more than enough - to be sure that there's nothing there
[12:06:44] <Obormot\Arcturus> My favorite, and pithiest, summary of the "enlightenment" phenomenon was an SSC comment on one of the posts about this, which went like this
[12:07:09] <Obormot\Arcturus> "1. Crack lens of telescope.  2. Announce discovery of jagged lines in the heavens."
[12:07:32] <nshepperd2> haha
[12:07:40] <dbohdan> A good way to put it
[12:08:20] <quanticle> lol
[12:08:38] <dbohdan> Though I am not convinced some amount of meditation isn't good or useful if you can avoid going off the deep end
[12:08:52] <dbohdan> Which ability varies from person to person
[12:09:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> Meh
[12:09:15] <rsaarelm> What'd count as there being something there in this case?
[12:09:38] <Obormot\Arcturus> You want to relax, well, God gave us a perfectly fine device for accomplishing that end
[12:09:41] <Obormot\Arcturus> Alcohol
[12:09:55] <quanticle> Wow, what if you're Muslim? Or Mormon?
[12:10:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> Sucks to be you
[12:10:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> Maybe convert
[12:10:26] <adiabatty> what if you don't want to be drunk later
[12:10:31] <adiabatty> or get fat on booze calories
[12:10:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> Don't drink *that* much.
[12:11:16] <rsaarelm> That usually ends up with you drinking a bottle of vodka every night and still hating your life.
[12:11:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> uh
[12:11:28] <adiabatty> I like the idea of drinking booze more than I like the effects, it seems. whenever I drink I need to kind of clear my schedule for a couple hours and not do anything that requires brain work or driving
[12:11:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> Pretty sure it "usually" doesn't end like that :p
[12:11:42] <adiabatty> Obormot\Arcturus: consider where he's from, though
[12:11:49] * Obormot\Arcturus shrug
[12:12:44] <rsaarelm> I guess my frame for when you pick up meditation is more "your life feels fucked up and you have no idea how to fix it" rather than "you want to unwind a bit".
[12:12:59] <rsaarelm> And the traditional folk remedy for #1 is also alcohol.
[12:13:33] <Obormot\Arcturus> If your life feels fucked up and you have no idea how to fix it, the last thing you should be doing is starting an activity that can break your brean
[12:13:39] <Obormot\Arcturus> *brain
[12:13:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> Now, probably alcohol is also the wrong thing in that scenario
[12:14:10] <Obormot\Arcturus> That doesn't make meditation the right thing, though
[12:14:14] <nshepperd2> i hear that therapists were invented recently
[12:14:48] <nshepperd2> actually, no that's wrong, therapy is the oldest profession
[12:15:01] <Obormot\Arcturus> Isn't that prostitution
[12:15:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> Or ... are those the same thing
[12:15:13] *** Quits: ua__ (~ua@public-gprs227485.centertel.pl) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[12:15:17] <nshepperd2> yeah, therapy
[12:15:21] <Obormot\Arcturus> lol
[12:15:25] <rsaarelm> Psychedelic therapy seems to be making a comeback. There seems to be some sort of simulated annealing of your brain thing that can fuck you up worse but also seems to have a significant enough chance of leaving you better off that actual psychiatrists are going for "just give people some shrooms in a very carefully controlled environment".
[12:16:14] <rsaarelm> Shrooms without the psychiatrist, or any sitter, and the controlled environment are obviously a worse idea.
[12:17:02] <quanticle> Obormot\Arcturus: I think that nshepperd2 is right, actually. We had witch doctors and shamans long before we had prostitutes.
[12:17:47] <nshepperd2> citation needed
[12:18:09] <quanticle> Don't you need a settled agricultural civilization in order to have prostitutes?
[12:18:30] <quanticle> Whereas shamans are present aplenty in hunter-gatherer tribes
[12:18:33] <nshepperd2> nah, barter of sex for food counts
[12:18:53] <nshepperd2> that could totally happen in a hunter-gatherer tribe
[12:19:02] <quanticle> Yeah, but then how do you distinguish prostitution from polyamory?
[12:19:14] <quanticle> In the context of a hunter-gatherer tribe
[12:19:15] <rsaarelm> Like, being stuck in a rut is a thing, and we don't really have a lot of concepts or tools right now for mental ruts or getting out of them in the "get out of depression, alcoholism etc. dysfunctional cycle you're stuck in" sense.
[12:19:20] <nshepperd2> dunno
[12:20:10] <rsaarelm> Obvious search algorithm analogy is obvious, hence "simulated annealing" for what psychedelics and meditation does.
[12:20:14] <adiabatty> rsaarelm: that sounds like the sort of person who wants to get to new mental states like oriental-martial-artists want to get through belt colors. It seems like there's a _very_ distinct split in goals between the hippies who are into jhanas and loving-kindness and the people who just want to not be on autopilot mentally (or want to not get panic attacks)
[12:20:27] <quanticle> nshepperd2: Trad answer: "You don't"
[12:20:56] <nshepperd2> i think it's barter when the transaction doesn't include an assumption of mutual ongoing loyalty
[12:21:03] <nshepperd2> or something like that
[12:21:07] <quanticle> rsaarelm: Not just 'shrooms. DMT too.
[12:21:14] <dbohdan> "Prostitution rates have decreased 99% compared to the environment of evolutionary adaptedness."
[12:22:26] <rsaarelm> adiabatty: I dunno, both seem to want to get a clearer look at their mind and not be driven around by stupid stuff their brain yells at them. I guess there might be people in the hippie-er end that just want to get fucked up in weird mental states, but I don't think I know any meditation enthusiasts who sound like that.
[12:23:26] <adiabatty> I mean, there was that one guy who came in here and pimped meditation and recommended Harris' Waking Up app (a solid recommendation) and complained that we weren't open-minded enough and ragequit
[12:23:36] <adiabatty> but that just means we're not around hippie types
[12:24:14] <rsaarelm> You guys do get pissed at the non-hippie meditation people as well though.
[12:24:21] <quanticle> zoobie?
[12:24:26] <adiabatty> possibly.
[12:24:39] <adiabatty> rsaarelm: I think that's just Obormot\Arcturus
[12:25:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> Wow who said we're not open-minded enough? Slander
[12:25:29] <Obormot\Arcturus> We're *precisely* as open-minded as it is correct to be
[12:25:42] <quanticle> That seems unlikely just on priors, but I'll take the compliment.

Additionally, the risk posed by all offender subtypes decreased during the follow-up period; however, HiHa offenders presented with the highest risk over time and had a longer police monitoring.

[23:23:45] <dbohdan> (Or would the original spelling "tyger" work better somehow?)
[23:23:50] <RiversHaveWings> The interesting part to me is that the thing actually produces symmetrical outputs if you have "symmetry" in the prompt.
[23:24:03] <kuudes> also icu use
[23:24:32] <dbohdan> RiversHaveWings: Can it do radial/rotational symmetry?
[23:24:38] <RiversHaveWings> Yes
[23:24:48] <RiversHaveWings> Sometimes it outputs radially symmetrical stuff for a "symmetry" prompt
[23:24:53] <dbohdan> Cool

[23:32:45] <RiversHaveWings> so
[23:32:48] <RiversHaveWings> i don't use it
[23:32:59] <RiversHaveWings> would i have to use rsync
[23:33:04] <RiversHaveWings> or can just use curl
[23:33:22] <kuudes> what is the proper tripwire level when one can be confident that vaccines don't stop the spread? certainly that level is less than 100% of population as cases and more than 0% of population as cases, but what is it and how does it relate to fraction of population received no doses, 1 doses and full doses? this matters to me decisionwise, as I want to know how strong this prior is so that I can use it to trigger some behaviour changes that I would like 
[23:33:22] <kuudes> otherwise avoid, such as stockpiling
[23:33:42] <RiversHaveWings> Their fileserver went down once when the VQGAN+CLIP notebooks were mentioned in a youtube video that got like 20k views, so
[23:33:47] <gwern> rsync. I don't have any http interfaces

[23:37:55] <gwern> 'f8' means they're quantized much more heavily and so produce worse images, iirc?
[23:38:12] <RiversHaveWings> 8 is the downsampling ratio
[23:38:23] <RiversHaveWings> The f=8 is much better at reconstruction
[23:38:41] <RiversHaveWings> Than the f=16
