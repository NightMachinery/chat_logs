[15:37:16] <Agiofws> Has everyone here synced a sheet with a SQL table?
[15:38:23] <Naktibalda> you can import CSV file to mysql table. Exporting from google sheets is out of scope for this channel. You may need to create matching table manually.
[15:39:39] <Agiofws> Okay what's the basic language to display queries of the CVS file in HTML pages?
[15:39:53] <Agiofws> Do you use php?
[15:40:20] <Naktibalda> you can choose from many languages
[15:42:50] <Agiofws> I was hoping that I could use the query from a  Google sheet and displaying it within an iframe  but i can't get the drop down cells to display from withing an ifarme of the sheet

[20:55:07] <thumbs> saint_: they are in the documentation, look for "configuration variables"
[20:55:45] <thumbs> ph88: there is no such thing as "take mysql database offline", but you can set it read-only

[20:58:12] <thumbs> it won't wait for queries to finish, so don't stop mysqld
[20:59:04] <ph88> thumbs, i'm considering when it is safe to start doing schema migrations
[20:59:58] <ph88> i guess i could set to read-only, then show processlist .. see if there are no more write queries and then start doing migrations
