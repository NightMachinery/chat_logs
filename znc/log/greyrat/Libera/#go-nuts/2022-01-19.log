[02:14:03] <fizzie> Or make it a map of pointers, alternatively.

[02:21:41] <pinky_> i don't think filepath is using a goroutine
[02:24:45] <fizzie> The zero value of `*somestruct` is a nil pointer, so if you're not getting _that_, but instead just a pointer at a `somestruct` that has the struct's zero value, it must've been what was in the map. Maybe something's modifying a copy that wasn't intended to. Hard to guess.

[02:45:27] <pinky_> yeah thats true, like if they change the behavior of filepath.WalkDir ?

[02:49:02] <fizzie> It's not explicitly called out as so, but I'd probably still feel comfortable assuming filepath.WalkDir is entirely synchronous and calls the callback function in the same goroutine it was itself called in.
[02:49:53] <fizzie> "The files are walked in lexical order, which makes the output deterministic --" is a particularly big hint in that direction, even if it's not strictly the same.

[03:55:46] <fizzie> It doesn't exactly say. Possibly deliberately. I think empirically speaking the non-shuffled order is lexical order in terms of files, and in declaration order in terms of test methods in those files, similar to how init methods get executed.

[14:13:22] <alwyn> Newb here, if a function returns a *Type (in this case url.Parse()), how can I use it in e.g. struct instantiation?
[14:14:42] <alwyn> Or should I make the struct field type *url.URL instead of without the *?
[14:17:29] <bookworm> dereference it if you want to store the value
[14:18:06] <bookworm> or just store the pointer, doesn't matter much in this case

[15:50:34] <j416> usually there's a reason for a type being a pointer type or not; it often makes sense to stick to that unless you have a reason not to
[15:50:58] <j416> (that, meaning whichever type (pointer vs. not) is returned)
[15:51:37] <j416> it maybe more expensive to copy it around if not a pointer, or there may be issues with copying (mutex, for instance)

[18:55:40] <alwyn> In response to earlier today, I'm still not sure how to do this. Feels kinda bad. With the following code I get a "pkg/models.Message composite literal uses unkeyed fields" https://bpa.st/ID7A
[18:56:02] <alwyn> I tried with/without the * in the Message struct

[19:06:03] <fizzie> alwyn: "composite literal uses unkeyed fields" is just complaining about using `Foo{bar, baz}` instead of `Foo{Bar: bar, Baz: baz}`. Which isn't even invalid, just ill-advised. But you can avoid the message by doing the latter.

[19:24:36] <vincent> I reckon the colon syntax is expressing a range for 100 000 000 integers?
[19:26:27] <vincent> oh no ok, you put the number 1 at position 99 999 999
[19:26:40] <vincent> so as to nudge the compiler into allocating the whole array
[19:27:05] <seebs> i don't think that matters
[19:27:28] <seebs> if you declare an [N]array, you are getting an array of N items, whether or not any of them have values.
