[01:04:54] <MaxLeiter> https://www.phoenixframework.org/
[01:04:57] <MaxLeiter> is what interests me atm
[01:05:03] <MaxLeiter> V has too much drama around it. dont trust the creator
[01:05:42] <mooff> Beam is quite a moving VM
[01:05:44] <MaxLeiter> https://andrewkelley.me/post/why-donating-to-musl-libc-project.html has a nice rundown 
[01:06:06] <MaxLeiter> I've seen https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZvmYaFkNJI&feature=emb_title and its quite impressive 
[01:06:17] <mooff> i don't know that it loads or runs well on web workers / wasm yet
[01:06:40] <mooff> i don't think we need a backend from the point of view of the client

[03:35:56] <mooff> i just got a great domain
[03:36:28] <mooff> and will start an irc network :)
[03:37:33] <mooff> i'll set it up so that foobar.com/#channel is a valid url to drop into a seamless chat
[03:37:51] <mooff> without having to worry about nickname, thelounge451, or any of that stuff :)
[03:38:04] <mooff> this will be fun :)
[03:44:09] <mooff> xnaas: the best rename in irc history :p

[11:13:08] <bookworm> like how to build a lava moat and such
[11:13:18] <johncs> haha tbh I haven't really been into XKCD the past buncha years
[11:13:26] <johncs> my knowledge of it is a layover from a younger me
[11:13:44] <bookworm> ah yes... the grass was greener then
[11:13:45] <johncs> (not that I'm particularly old, but just a younger young me)
[11:14:12] <johncs> haha I moved from california to portland
[11:14:17] <johncs> the grass was quite a lot greener because the sun hit it
