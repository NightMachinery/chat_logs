[00:39:57] <Guest1847> https://regex101.com/r/uugoMh/1 the data is just a CSV. I like to remove time stamp and convert us date format to (european?) format.Â  I dont get it how substitue :-(
[00:40:19] *** Guest1847 is now known as Daniel_Switzerla
[00:41:55] <locsmif> Daniel_Switzerla: why not use date(1
[00:42:53] <Daniel_Switzerla> i just made the regex training and like to do it with regex....what do you mean with date(1?

[00:45:18] <locsmif> Daniel_Switzerla: why not use date(1)?
[00:45:43] <Daniel_Switzerla> is this a regex command?
[00:46:24] <locsmif> Nope, a GNU tool to convert dates
[00:46:39] <locsmif> Usually similar libraries are available in every programming language
[00:46:50] *** Quits: rewt (~default@user/rewt) (Killed (NickServ (GHOST command used by rewt__)))
[00:46:56] <locsmif> Other than that, what's the problem you're experiencing?
[00:47:55] <locsmif> That is, I'm looking at your regex101 link but I don't see your problem (yet)?
[00:48:07] <Daniel_Switzerla> have you checked my link? i could match what I need but can't do the replacing correctly. I think there is is something
[00:48:10] <Daniel_Switzerla> ups

[00:48:12] *** ChanServ sets mode: +v rewt
[00:48:30] <Daniel_Switzerla> sorry wanted to remove the link part :-)
[00:48:41] <locsmif> Well, depending on what you're using, replacing is handled differently
[00:48:46] <Daniel_Switzerla> you see i can match what i need but can't manage the replacing
[00:48:47] <locsmif> So what are you using?
[00:49:09] <locsmif> In PHP, it's preg_replace, in perl, it's s/.../.../ etc.
[00:49:42] <Daniel_Switzerla> i just use the regex101 replace
[00:50:54] <locsmif> Your test string has several dates in different formats and your substitution field doesn't have anything..
[00:51:33] <locsmif> And you appear to be using a pipe symbol which means depending on the format, the indexes of your capturing groups are different
[00:52:06] <locsmif> So, again, you could do it this way, but why? Are you planning on going to regex101 to replace American dates with European ones?
[00:52:09] <Daniel_Switzerla> yes that was my idea....i have two types of date format but both have a time stamp
[00:52:25] <locsmif> So again, it depends on what you're actually using
[00:52:39] <Daniel_Switzerla> it will be python
[00:52:59] <locsmif> Then use re.sub with the appropriate backreferences and allow for both / or . as separator
[00:53:04] <Daniel_Switzerla> to your question why? mhh well some brain training
[00:53:27] <Daniel_Switzerla> but I have not figured out the logic good enough
[00:53:55] <Daniel_Switzerla> backreference is a good keyword...
[00:57:06] <locsmif> hold on, I also know python
[00:58:27] <Daniel_Switzerla> and with the pipe I made two options...but this is wrong I just realize. somehow it's like this:
[00:58:28] <Daniel_Switzerla> option 1: us date >>> replace the time stamp with blank and switch month and day
[00:58:28] <Daniel_Switzerla> option 2: eu date >>> replace the time stamp with blank
[00:59:19] <locsmif> Do you need to replace multiple dates on one line?
[00:59:56] <locsmif> So want one regex to do both?
[01:00:00] <locsmif> So you*
[01:00:17] <locsmif> That seems needlessly complicated
[01:00:23] <locsmif> And I'm not I can do it
[01:00:28] <locsmif> not sure*
[01:01:38] <locsmif> I mean, there might be a way to use lookahead/lookbehind as an if/then/else construct, but why?
[01:01:44] <Daniel_Switzerla> yes one regex....in python it would be two+ steps but with regex all needs to to one line
[01:01:54] <locsmif> How do you know that?
[01:01:57] <Daniel_Switzerla> why....for fun
[01:02:14] <Daniel_Switzerla> how know what?
[01:02:25] <Daniel_Switzerla> in python?
[01:02:36] <locsmif> That you only need one line convert both ways using a regular expression?
[01:02:40] <locsmif> Have you done it before?
[01:02:56] <locsmif> I sure haven't
[01:03:03] <Daniel_Switzerla> no not yet...just with one date in one line
[01:03:24] <Daniel_Switzerla> no problem...

[18:33:50] <adeliktas> re101-donkey-30 if the text does always have this format and you only want "December27, 2020 - December 2021", you could just match that part with an endline($) like "Dec(ember)?.*$" or what would be the issue with that?
[18:35:23] <re101-donkey-30> Its tough to say because they are employment contracts and this is hand keyed so I wouldnt trust it too much.Â  This is why I tried to find a REGEX that tries to encompass multiple scenarios.Â  Is there a way to say get the first instance of the date after the word EXIBIT?
[18:38:14] <adeliktas> re101-donkey-30 it's probably easier to understand if you include all possible data input, which the regex would have to be able to match
[18:39:51] <re101-donkey-30> The date RegEx is picking up all of the dates.Â  Except that I just want the date third line down from the word EXIBIT.Â  They other thing I would mention is that it always has a hyphen between the dates.Â  Is this much of any help?

[18:46:22] <adeliktas> re101-donkey-30 well what i would think of would be "date \- date$" then.
[18:49:46] <adeliktas> dmaislin you could solve that by grouping your regex and then only printing the part after : (".*$")
[18:51:41] <dmaislin> adeliktas feel free to show me
[18:53:52] <adeliktas> dmaislin no. Creating the regex is your work. You can simply look it up for your tool/platform. Look for "find and replace match part" or alike.

[19:13:19] <OnlineCop> I like to say "(?:[^XYZ]+|X...|Y...|Z...)*" (where each of 'X', 'Y' and 'Z' are some character you want the "OR..." logic to evaluate for you.

[19:13:55] <OnlineCop> Like, `[^\t{}]+` is going to stop when it hits a tab or a '{'.
[19:14:11] <dmaislin> https://regex101.com/r/QtbUEG/1
[19:14:53] <OnlineCop> Those alternations will handle a tab (so long as a tab doesn't contain a colon after it, making it into a KEY:VALUE paor), or an opening '{' with its associated closing '}', but because you also [^}] then it won't process after the outer {...} finishs.

[19:22:36] <dmaislin> Classic events are just the worst and every customer seems to have varied oddities
[19:25:09] <OnlineCop> Is this a one-off thing, or something you're scripting?
[19:26:26] <OnlineCop> If it's a one-off (like something you'd use within vscode), I wouldn't spend too much effort on it. However, if you're putting this into some kind of parsing script, then I'd always err on the side of more robust, even if that makes it more complicated.
[19:29:30] <OnlineCop> Personal facepalm. Looking over https://regex101.com/r/tA9pM8/1 (found it with a 'json regex' search), their STRING handling is more elaborate than mine... and that tells me that I now need to fix MY string handling to deal with \uxxxx notation.

[22:49:51] <OnlineCop> re101-donkey-30: You usually group two things you want to search for: `(?:base|fixed) compensation`.
[22:50:16] <re101-donkey-30> Thank you kindly, I will try.
[22:50:26] <OnlineCop> It first tries to match "base". If that fails, it tries "fixed". If THAT fails, the match at that point has failed, and it tries again later.
[22:50:39] <OnlineCop> But if either of those succeed, then it will look for the space, followed by "compensation", etc.
[22:51:09] <re101-donkey-30> does it matter if its uppper case or lower case? just in case someone fat fingers an upper case?
[22:51:28] <OnlineCop> These `(?: ... | ... | ... )` groups should let you do an "OR" for only that portion, but everything before and after the group should match as normal.
[22:51:47] <OnlineCop> There's a flag on the right, /i which indicates the entire string is "case-insensitive".
[22:52:27] <OnlineCop> It's usually next to /g (global match), /m (multiline), etc.
[22:53:03] <OnlineCop> If you see that "/gm" on the right, click it, and it should give you a dropdown which includes "insensitive".
[22:54:17] <re101-donkey-30> for some reason it is failing to get fixed
[22:54:18] <re101-donkey-30> https://regex101.com/r/qNhiVk/1
[22:55:24] <OnlineCop> You removed the /g (global) flag.
[22:55:44] <OnlineCop> Without /g it will stop the entire search once it finds a single match. With /g it will try to find all matches in the text.

[22:56:59] <OnlineCop> That  \K  is specific to some PCRE flavors. If you're using something else (like Python's "re" module, Javascript/ECMAscript, etc.), that may not be available.
[22:57:04] <re101-donkey-30> Im too of a noob with this.
[22:57:09] <OnlineCop> https://regex101.com/r/qNhiVk/2
[22:57:20] <OnlineCop> The only difference between version /1 and /2 is that I've added the /g flag.
[22:57:38] <OnlineCop> The flag is to the right of your "^.*(?:base|fixed) compensation.*\K\$[\d,.]+" pattern.

[23:05:04] <OnlineCop> That just sounds like it's not PCRE-compliant. There are a few other things you can do here.
[23:05:59] <OnlineCop> All \K is doing is clearing away the parts of the text that had previously matched, so the only thing that shows up in the Match Info is the stuff to the right. Since you don't have that option, you've got to simply "keep" all that previously-matched text and then "capture" the part you want.

[23:06:41] <OnlineCop> https://regex101.com/r/qNhiVk/3
[23:07:21] <OnlineCop> This will give you both a match (see the MATCH INFORMATION section on the right) and a capture.
