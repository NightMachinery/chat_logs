[19:53:01] <gwozniak> Saying that an aphorism is "harmful" because it is not always accurate would be along the lines of saying analogies are bad because they are not always complete

[20:18:58] <iDrougge> Personally, I don't see any real opposition between FP and OOP.
[20:19:25] <gwozniak> I think OOP gets a really bad rep, even though it can be really useful
[20:19:41] <technomancy> I think OOP means different things to different people and thus discussions about it are usually a waste of time
[20:19:43] <jmiven> it depends how you define those terms iDrougge, but I personally agree
[20:19:50] <jmiven> technomancy: exactly
[20:20:13] <gwozniak> Its definition has always been a moving target, and it has always been maligned
[20:20:15] <iDrougge> gwozniak: Some of it is deserved because the OOP term has conflated several vaguely related technologies.
[20:20:19] <jmiven> it's true for FP as well
[20:20:44] <jmiven> (although FP isn't really maligned at the moment)
[20:21:28] <gwozniak> iDrougge: there have been some truly insane OOP things for the sake of inheritance, for example.  Surely why it leaves a bad taste in many mouths
[20:21:34] <technomancy> also OOP was hyped to death by people selling their shit

[20:22:19] <iDrougge> gwozniak: In my book, inheritance is not an inherent part of OOP.
[20:22:25] <technomancy> you gotta expect some backlash when that happens
[20:22:43] <technomancy> iDrougge: you're teetering dangerously close to No True Scotsman there

[20:24:54] <technomancy> you don't have that problem if you just talk about the useful things on their own
[20:24:55] <indigo> IMO OOP is like any tool; there are better places to apply it and worse places to apply it. And then there's also your technique when using it, which can also be better or worse

[20:26:47] <technomancy> also why not just say "methods"; that's clear enough
[20:27:33] <iDrougge> Packages are a kind of encapsulation, aren't they? Or Modula-2, where you separate your program into modules that expose both data types and functions that operate on them, but not methods.
