[22:55:59] <thican> Hello, I have some warnings in the log file about the IPv6 address for the ORPort, and I have no idea what I misconfigured: [notice] Unable to find IPv6 address for ORPort 9001. You might want to specify IPv4Only to it or set an explicit address or set Address. [59 similar message(s) suppressed in last 3540 seconds]
[22:56:31] <thican> Here from my torrc file:
[22:56:32] <thican> ORPort [2001:41d0:2:c513:0:dead:beaf:cafe]:9001
[22:56:39] <thican> ORPort 188.165.6.66:9001
[22:56:50] <thican> So what this issue, please?
[22:57:40] <thican> And recently, I got a _lot_ of DDoS attacks, do you confirm something is going on on the Tor network?
[22:59:05] <xx> thican: you can only have 1 ORPort entry
[22:59:14] <thican> ah!
[22:59:17] <xx> in your current config, the later entry overrides the previous one
[22:59:36] <thican> ok, so I did use OutboundBindAddressOR for both address
[22:59:44] <xx> so use ORPort to specify the... port, and the other directives to specify the addresses
[22:59:49] <thican> but I want to be sure to not use the other IPv4 address
[23:00:03] <thican> ok, thanks for the answer.

[23:04:09] <thican> Well, I am not really satisfied with this solution, ORPort with only the port, because now it binds on every interface.
[23:05:07] <thican> And the service also seams available on every interface (which I close with the firewall)
[23:35:20] <thican> Another question please, how do I open and configure the listen port to the name resolution service? I donâ€™t see any related info on the default configuration file.
