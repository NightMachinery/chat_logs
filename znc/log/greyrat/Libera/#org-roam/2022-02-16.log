[16:01:43] <eugercek> konubinix: I'm sorry I haven't setup ZNC but I think this is your username. I'm thankful for the your help on my roam setup questions. Now I'm using Hypothesis to hihglight the pages and at the end I take notes like I'm explanining a friend.
[16:02:59] <konubinix> Good for you eugercek :-)
[16:03:08] <konubinix> I'm glap it helped
[16:03:13] <konubinix> *glad
[16:04:01] <eugercek> Also I'll use anottations on ios too, the good thing is let's say I have 15 minutes to kill because random real life thing. I can start anottate like there is no end :D. And compile them at home.
[16:05:11] <eugercek> I think your setup deserves a blog post! Humanity needs this :)
[16:05:49] <konubinix> Haha, the conversation is recorded somewhere in my second brain, waiting to mature
[16:06:28] <eugercek> Good to hear
[16:06:41] <konubinix> Maybe one time, during a consolidation phase, I will feel like putting that information in a more human readable format
[16:07:26] <konubinix> This is another awesomeness of zettelkasten to me. You can write stuff in there, then leave them for some time
[16:07:59] <konubinix> When you want to go back working in them, you are almost ready to continue as if you left it yesterday
[16:08:43] <konubinix> Well, not totally, your biological brains needs time to adjust, but I think it gives you the best chances to continue
[16:09:43] <konubinix> This is the bag of junk notes IÂ told about earlier. Old notes that did not receive the appropriate amount of attention and are juste waiting for you to take care of them.
[16:10:07] <konubinix> And somehow already contributing to giving you useful insight with the magic of links and backlinks
[16:14:03] <eugercek> I get that, I have random unfinished rants about every topic I've learned in CS. I'll put in my roam too. I hope they'll get the attention one day.
