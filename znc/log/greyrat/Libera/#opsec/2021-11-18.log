[02:00:34] <Joanna> Hi everyone Wow _inky I’m surprised that someone I know would be familiar with ink wells I have only heard about inkwells from people born in 1930s and before. I think the evolution of using ink wells is the reusable fountain pen ? I’ve never seen one of those. The fountain pen seems less wasteful than modern throwaway pens
[02:05:18] <iz> i think maybe we talked about this before, but when i was a kid, i had a fountain pen that used ink cartridges (but same tip mechanism)
[02:05:33] <iz> and i had a special cartridge w/ like a rubber bladder, so you could suck up liquids into it
[02:05:52] <iz> and i used to use lemon juice with it to do the invisible ink thing
[02:22:56] <Joanna> How often did you need to refill it ? I’ve never seen a fountain pen ever ..
[02:25:06] <Joanna> Hi iz :)
[02:25:42] <Joanna> I wonder why they got rid of fountain pens they seem like a good idea

[02:40:15] <_inky> i was using such a pen in school.
[02:40:30] <_inky> my friend found out two chemical recipes.
[02:40:39] <Joanna> Fountain pens also ?
[02:40:39] <_inky> one for writing with 'invisible' ink.
[02:40:46] <_inky> other for making the invisible visible.
[02:41:17] <_inky> so we got fountain pens and were using those to exchange 'letters' in school during the class.
[02:42:04] <Joanna> So the school only provided ink wells?
[02:42:27] <Joanna> How often did you need to refill fountain pen?
[02:42:41] <_inky> iz, how did you make the lemon juice visible later?
[02:42:56] <_inky> no no, in my time, schools were ok with ball pens.
[02:43:01] <_inky> so luckily we used ball pens.
[02:43:17] <_inky> but my parents were suffering with inkwells, even though ussr managed to produces ballpens.
[02:43:21] <iz> _inky: heat the paper
[02:43:41] <_inky> iz, how?  (:
[02:43:46] <iz> and it like turns brown
[02:43:51] <_inky> i mean how did you heat it practically?
[02:43:55] <_inky> interesting.
[02:44:04] <iz> over a candle or also in the toaster oven
[02:44:20] <_inky> Joanna: and i just bought a fountain pen in the soviet version of supermarket.
[02:44:35] <_inky> iz, understand. (:
[02:44:42] <iz> but with fire was more fun of course
[02:45:50] <_inky> we were carrying test tubes in the inside pockets of school jackets.
[02:46:34] <_inky> and a bit of cotton wool to swipe over the invisible text.
[02:46:55] <_inky> but it was hard, and it was also getting spilled.
[02:47:03] <_inky> so we went to cryptography.
[02:47:24] <_inky> firstly to dancing men, like in sherlock.
[02:47:38] <iz> yeah, same with crypto, but i had a friend who kept making dumb codes
[02:48:02] <iz> like he would write all of the letters of a word on top of each other and call that a code
[02:48:03] <_inky> then my mother told me to read mathias sandorf by jules verne.
[02:48:14] <_inky> and i discovered grid encryption.
[02:48:34] <Joanna> I prefer inventing chinese style characters..
[02:48:53] <_inky> later i made this program https://github.com/norayr/gridOric
[02:48:54] <SeaDough> ^ GitHub - norayr/gridOric
[02:49:06] <_inky> that helps to create cryptographic grids.
[02:49:34] <_inky> iz, (:
[02:49:40] <_inky> Joanna: how?
[02:49:58] <_inky> I know that there are some primitives, and if you learn them, it's easier to learn glyphs.
[02:50:18] <_inky> but i know it is easier with classical orthography which is used in taiwan, or in hong knog.
[02:50:19] <_inky> kong.
[02:50:28] <_inky> and harder with 'simplified' orthography.
[02:50:36] <_inky> but i don't know myself.
[02:51:03] <Joanna> More like symbols like a square can mean have
[02:51:45] <Joanna> A square inside a square can mean characteristic
[02:52:12] <Joanna> A square with vertical line can mean half
[02:53:25] <_inky> is it your invention, or you describe chinese writing system?
[02:54:14] <Joanna> No chines uses simplified drawings originally made with brushes.
[02:54:38] <Joanna> Chinese has no circles for that reason

[03:14:10] <_inky> very interesting.
[03:14:24] <_inky> it could be used to take notes faster.
[03:14:28] <_inky> probably.

[13:07:41] <Joanna> Hi everyone
[13:08:03] <CalimeroTeknik> iz, I acquired new languages when I was 20 and 24 with no less capability than when I was 5
[13:08:43] <Joanna> CalimeroTeknik: what kind of upbringing did you have?
[13:09:46] <CalimeroTeknik> no TV
[13:10:02] <Joanna> Sorry I just got here I might have missed part of conversation
[13:10:02] <CalimeroTeknik> parents available to answer questions
[13:10:08] <CalimeroTeknik> I can't identify anything else that's significant
[13:10:36] <CalimeroTeknik> I was responding to the conversation yesterday concerning things settling down in the brain with age
[13:12:08] <Joanna> Some things can be learned later but to be really good at things I think you need to start as a small child. For instance the best gymnasts started when they were around age 5 or less right ?
[13:12:56] <CalimeroTeknik> it's certainly easier and necessary to get the small margin for competition
[13:13:20] <Joanna> Some people say that people who spend a lot of time alone as a child are less susceptible to peer pressure.
[13:13:31] <CalimeroTeknik> and gymnastics involve not just thinking
[13:14:02] <CalimeroTeknik> less susceptible but more vulnerable to it
[13:14:08] <CalimeroTeknik> it's double-edged
[13:14:19] <Joanna> Flexibility is lost as you get older unless you keep using it. Both physically and mental flexibility
[13:16:02] <CalimeroTeknik> the flipside of not being used to function with peer pressure is that when you (I) encounter it, I haven't developed adequate defense mechanisms, so I use inadequate ones
[13:16:26] <CalimeroTeknik> that has been remediated now
[13:16:35] <Joanna> Most people will go along with peer pressure if they are able to but sometimes it is impossible to do what is expected by peers and full retribution is dealt for something beyond ones control
[13:17:29] <Joanna> Joanna: I grew up without tv also . Did anyone else here grow up without tv ?
[13:18:09] *** Joins: grobi (~grobi@user/grobi)
[13:18:21] <Joanna> Hi grobi
[13:18:34] <grobi> hello :)
[13:18:52] <Joanna> We were having a philosophical discussion:)
[13:20:23] <Joanna> CalimeroTeknik: I’ve had plenty of peer pressure but I was not able to conform so now I don’t care what people think so much
[13:21:37] <CalimeroTeknik> I care, but I tell them when they're wrong to demand this or that and why
[13:22:39] <Joanna> Arguing  with people in my experience is about as useful as yelling into a pillow:)
[13:23:22] <Joanna> They never have any logical reasons they just get stupid ideas put in their heads and believe they are correct..
[13:24:57] <Joanna> It’s a good exercise to try to track down where ideas are coming from though.. most often it’s from other people with bad ideas..
[13:25:05] <Joanna> Or good
[13:25:18] <Joanna> Very few ideas are original

[13:55:56] *** Quits: portalrat_ (~portalrat@user/portalrat) (Remote host closed the connection)
[14:02:37] <grobi> sorry have been afk :)
[14:44:57] <Joanna> It’s ok
[15:04:28] <CalimeroTeknik> I mostly just track ideas that have serious backing, but also the most common incorrect ones so I have the debunk at hand
[15:07:59] <CalimeroTeknik> tracking all indiscriminately is a thing for historians, that is people who are interested in the past (historians don't study the future); by contrast, I'm interested in the future, which a mix of information and decisions will determine
[15:08:11] <CalimeroTeknik> one good reason to be interested in the future is that it's where I'll spend the rest of my life
[16:21:51] <Joanna> CalimeroTeknik: can you provide any specific examples ?
[16:23:05] <CalimeroTeknik> of which item?
[16:24:31] <Joanna> What you said earlier
[16:27:26] <CalimeroTeknik> can you copy and paste the part you'd like an example of?
[16:53:14] <iz> CalimeroTeknik: if they are langauges with similar sounds, it shouldn't be an issue, esp at 20-24, that's still very young
[16:53:28] <CalimeroTeknik> completely different sounds
[16:53:46] <iz> CalimeroTeknik: like.. in different ranges?
[16:53:52] <CalimeroTeknik> the most similar the sounds, the harder it is to acquire a native-sounding accent, by the way, due to aliasing to your native sounds
[16:54:11] <CalimeroTeknik> the Finnish ä is not present in either of French or English
[16:54:32] <CalimeroTeknik> the Japanese う, as wel
[16:54:34] <iz> it's your hearing that will hone in on the sound range of language at a pretty early age
[16:55:10] <iz> so sounds that are different are fine, as long as they are in the same like.. tone/pitch range
[16:55:24] <iz> and this is more about _hearing_ the sounds than it is about making them
[16:56:25] <CalimeroTeknik> I've been exposed to most of the world's languages before age 2, but never acquired more than the phonology of 5 of them
[16:56:34] <CalimeroTeknik> uhm, 7 actually
[16:57:27] <CalimeroTeknik> but overall, I think it's a question of effort, of mental resources
[16:58:17] <CalimeroTeknik> if you decide to invest what you have into it, it works, at the cost of being unable of doing certain other things that would have required the resources
[16:58:21] <iz> oh, well if you had been hearing them at an early age, that probably helped you
[16:58:35] <CalimeroTeknik> very passively; it's insufficient
[16:58:47] <iz> not for what i'm talking about
[16:59:05] <iz> it's not even about actually learning the language, it's just about your hearing honing in
[16:59:09] <CalimeroTeknik> yes, it should matter
[16:59:33] <CalimeroTeknik> I mean, when I started actually paying attention to the sounds, it was a whole world of difference
[16:59:47] <CalimeroTeknik> yes, it's just phonology so far
[17:00:17] <iz> it's like in the first 6 months
[17:00:25] <iz> before you even start to speak
[17:01:04] <iz> that's why they always say to talk to your infants a lot, esp when they are young

[17:17:05] <Joanna> It’s very rare for an adult to be able to easily learn languages. I once saw a show about idiot savants and one of them was really good at learning languages.
[17:18:52] <CalimeroTeknik> or take Daniel Tammet
[17:19:13] <CalimeroTeknik> he learned icelandic in a week and was on TV by the end of it
[17:21:33] <Joanna> The critical period is important
[17:23:34] <Joanna> If animals are kept in cages too small when young they never learn to move properly for the rest of their lives. Example a horse who is sort of clumsy and cannot gallop because cage was too small
[17:25:37] <Joanna> Most people cannot learn a language within a week as an adult. I’ve been trying to learn a foreign language for years and years and I can’t remember most of the new words I hear. If I was a small child I would know it by now.
[17:26:48] <Joanna> Thousands of hours of listening to the foreign language and most passes by unabsorbed.
[17:28:57] <iz> part of that effect is that your need to communicate is already filled w/ the language you know
[17:30:47] <iz> if you do like a total immersion program in a language, you will learn way more and faster.. i took like 3 years of japanese in college classes in the USA.. and then did one semester in a japanese univ, where classes were all taught in japanese and they really forced you to use it or not be able to say what you are trying to say.. and i learned and retained like literally 5x to 8x more than i had learned and 
[17:30:53] <iz> retained in those 3 years of classes
[17:39:16] <Joanna> Sure immersion being dumped in foreign country works but that’s unlikely I’d end up in foreign country living with people who speak a foreign language. I’ve tried to watch media in foreign language with English subtitles and I learned a lot of words only if they are used a lot. Most of the words are forgotten.

[17:54:34] <jan6> 15:24 <iz> it's your hearing that will hone in on the sound range of language at a pretty early age
[17:54:38] <jan6> before birth, actually
[17:57:07] <jan6> I saw some study, that people who were surrounded by some language, say, japanese, before birth, and never heard it afterwards, and grew up normal life in like, europe or america or whatnot, still had a subconcious recognition that "this is language", as opposed to native westeners who's brains didn't automatically register it as language, even though neither of the groups actually understoor
[17:57:07] <jan6> anything being said
[18:00:39] <iz> yeah, it's like in the first 6 months, an infant can hear all ranges of sound and sometime around 7 months, you've honed in on what sound ranges are for language and it kinda drops off for the other ranges.. i guess it's almost too much to have all of it at first

[18:05:23] *** Joins: grobi (~grobi@user/grobi)
[18:14:43] <CalimeroTeknik> Joanna, I learned all my Japanese vocabulary by looking up words when watching shows
[18:15:47] <CalimeroTeknik> it works if you pause to look up words you hear distinctily; the subs are not sufficient (after a few years you should be able to switch to a subtitle for the hard of hearing)
[18:15:52] <Joanna> That sounds tedious
[18:15:57] <CalimeroTeknik> really no
[18:16:30] <CalimeroTeknik> what I watch is very rich in meaning and nuance, and looking up key words improves the experience significantly
[18:16:38] <CalimeroTeknik> there's only so much a translation can do
[18:16:41] <Joanna> Japanese word order is a lot different than English
[18:16:56] <CalimeroTeknik> "word order" is too weak a description
[18:17:07] <CalimeroTeknik> it's not the same grammatical worldview
[18:17:15] <Joanna> Translation isn’t always precise
[18:17:26] <CalimeroTeknik> it could be, but some things are lost in translation
[18:17:48] <CalimeroTeknik> it's not always possible to take everything that's important across
[18:18:30] <CalimeroTeknik> if you watch shows like Pokémon, even an imprecise translation is more than sufficient and you don't ever need fine understanding of the nuances in the original
[18:18:31] <Joanna> I can’t remember most words anyway
[18:18:55] <CalimeroTeknik> when I'm looking up a word for the tenth time, I get fed up and just remember instead
[18:19:24] <CalimeroTeknik> my brain realizes that it will be the easiest way, otherwise I'll look it up again, and again
[18:19:40] <Joanna> I hate that I’d rather not bother
[18:20:16] <Joanna> I guess some people like self torture:)
[18:21:31] <CalimeroTeknik> I want to know what the word means exactly
[18:22:13] <CalimeroTeknik> (because it is clearly important for understanding)
[18:22:39] <CalimeroTeknik> again, if you watch shows like pokémon, don't bother, translations are more accurate than the original ever was with itself
[18:23:59] <CalimeroTeknik> I'm talking about stuff where there's a subtle rhyme on the 4th dictionary sense of a word on another, and the assembly of the two are a third word that you can catch up on, as a wink by the author to get a concept across
[18:25:01] <CalimeroTeknik> with a subtitle, well first the translator would need to notice, and second, good luck fitting it in the translation
[18:25:42] *** Quits: mooff (mooff@awful.cooking) (Quit: Quit)
[18:30:39] <CalimeroTeknik> for poems where each word has specific symbolism, you're also just out cold with a translation, it's easier to just… listen to the original
[18:31:12] <jan6> symbolism is near impossible to fit into a subtitle, yeah
[18:31:41] <jan6> but I think most people wouldn't intentionally watch such stuff until they feel somewhat confident ALREADY
[18:32:50] <iz> yeah, what's nice about japanese shows also, is often different characters will showcase uh.. different styles of saying mostly the same thing

[23:26:10] <CalimeroTeknik> jan6, doing what you aim to do might be the best teacher
[23:26:34] <CalimeroTeknik> I learned Japanese through symbolic / artistic works
[23:26:57] <CalimeroTeknik> even primarily through song lyrics bending grammar to its limits
[23:27:57] <CalimeroTeknik> it's a general attitude in life: the more I want to do something, the more I do the hard stuff first (and conversely, the less I want to do something, the more I do the easy stuff first)
[23:29:24] <iz> CalimeroTeknik: do you know like.. w/ calculators, some use reverse polish notation, often the scientific ones
[23:30:48] <iz> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation
[23:30:49] <SeaDough> ^ Reverse Polish notation, also known as reverse Łukasiewicz notation, Polish postfix notation or simply postfix notation, is a mathematical notation in which operators follow their operands, in contrast to Polish notation, in which operators precede their operands. It does not need any parentheses as long as each operator has a fixed number of operands.
[23:31:20] <iz> japanese grammar reminds me of that
[23:31:54] <CalimeroTeknik> because except for the attributive order that remains, the sentences are left-branching, built opposite to English?
[23:32:31] <CalimeroTeknik> as a translator you need a stack if lazy to do ja→en… or tricks
[23:33:17] <CalimeroTeknik> the word order of clauses is exactly opposite to French
[23:33:27] <CalimeroTeknik> example: https://oremilac.tk/ling/%E9%87%8E%E5%8E%9F%20%E6%96%87.png
[23:33:28] <SeaDough> ^ [image/png] (24.8KiB)
[23:33:41] <iz> yeah, like vs english
[23:34:05] <CalimeroTeknik> well, French also has inverse attributive order to Japanese and English which have the same
[23:34:19] <CalimeroTeknik> basically "adjective noun" in en&ja
[23:34:26] <CalimeroTeknik> fr has "noun adjective"
[23:34:50] <iz> also, in RPN, it's like for communitive things like addition or multiplication, the order doesn't matter
[23:35:08] <iz> so it's like number operator number operator
[23:35:15] <CalimeroTeknik> rpn?
[23:35:25] <CalimeroTeknik> ah yes
[23:35:30] <iz> reverse polish notation, like if you are adding to the last term
[23:35:49] <CalimeroTeknik> well it's simply suffix
[23:36:05] <iz> kinda like watashi wa biru o whatever
[23:36:12] <iz> yeah, like the suffixes
[23:36:53] <iz> it's like you are suffix marking
[23:38:39] <CalimeroTeknik> Japanese particles are very much like case markers actually
[23:38:56] <CalimeroTeknik> there is no example I can think of, of a particle that is not a suffix to a clause
[23:39:22] <CalimeroTeknik> if you thought of "to", be aware that the last one is often omitted, but implied
