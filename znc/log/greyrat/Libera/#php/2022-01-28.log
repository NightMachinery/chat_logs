[04:18:05] <Voxel> Hey all ^^
[04:18:14] <Voxel> How would you code a constants file?
[04:18:35] <Voxel> I mean, there's an app which is structured in a file system.
[04:19:01] <Voxel> The app has to know where app files are stored and their names
[04:19:03] <__adrian> generally, i would not
[04:19:08] <__adrian> those would be config settings
[04:19:36] <Voxel> And you would store the public directory path in config?
[04:19:49] <__adrian> i would store anything configurable in the config
[04:19:50] <Voxel> Or CSS/JS files path too?
[04:20:03] <Voxel> These are generally not configurable, but constant
[04:20:40] <__adrian> people assume so, but it's usually pretty quick they need to change soemthing because it's on a differennt server
[04:20:45] <Voxel> Like /public or /app/core/database.php etc.
[04:21:04] <__adrian> both of those examples will vary
[04:21:12] <__adrian> i.e., they won't literally be from  /
[04:21:25] <__adrian> they'll be relative to  /where/app/is/installed
[04:21:46] <Voxel> The app calculates its own root dir based on its root
[04:22:00] *** Quits: litharge (litharge@libera/bot/litharge) (Remote host closed the connection)
[04:22:06] <Voxel> define('ROOT_DIRPATH', realpath(__DIR__));
[04:22:18] <Voxel> In the main bootstrap or something
[04:22:22] <__adrian> realpath(__DIR__)  // heh, that's a new one
[04:22:29] <Voxel> This global would be used in constants as a reference
[04:22:48] <Voxel> Something like private $publicDirpath = ROOT_DIRPATH . DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR . 'public'; // /public
[04:23:16] <__adrian> a project root dir is something that's probably fine. but (a) it's just __DIR__  (b) use  const  not  define()
[04:23:23] <Voxel> However, it would be a constant, but the version is 7.4 (no readonly keyword).
[04:23:28] <__adrian> at least, that's the thing to prefer
[04:23:56] *** Joins: litharge (litharge@libera/bot/litharge)
[04:24:15] <Voxel> I don't remember why I used realpath, but I'm sure it was for some kind of security measure
[04:24:19] <__adrian> opinion: you should pretend "readonly" doesn't exist. it's dumb and counterproductive.
[04:24:33] <__adrian> you should read about what __DIR__ is
[04:28:23] <Voxel> Perhaps, I used realpath to omit symbolic links
[04:28:30] <__adrian> you should read about what __DIR__ is
[04:28:57] <__adrian> anyway - regarding where to define constants. i usually put them on classes - rare that a bare const makes sense these days.
[04:29:47] <Voxel> Something like ./../etc/test to /etc/test
[04:29:55] <BadAdviceCat> __adrian, what's wrong with readonly?
[04:30:28] <__adrian> it's a poor solution imo
[04:30:37] <BadAdviceCat> I never got around to trying the features out.
[04:30:50] <__adrian> just crossing my fingers that it won't hurt accessors
[04:31:06] <__adrian> *hurt/delay
[04:31:24] <Voxel> __adrian, the problem with a class and static properties is that it should be prepared before used. For example, style files are in public, but public is prepared before styles.
[04:31:29] <BadAdviceCat> Ah that, I was concerned how it would hurt/affect accessors too.
[04:31:56] <__adrian> Voxel: i'm not sure what you mean by that, but i didn't suggest static properties
[04:32:26] <Voxel> I mean, static disallows initialization within itself
[04:32:31] <Voxel> Something like Constant expression contains invalid operations
[04:32:33] <BadAdviceCat> It really seems we'll never get that feature though. Seems that people just like using getVariable() and setVariable() and other variations of getter/setters -.-
[04:32:33] <entropy_> how do i get the second word on from a string?
[04:32:34] <__adrian> yes
[04:32:40] <__adrian> constants _shouldn't_
[04:32:42] <entropy_> like if i type: /me hey there
[04:32:50] <entropy_> it will get the "hey there"
[04:33:05] <__adrian> const foo = bar();  // this doesn't work, but that's ok because it obviously shouldn't be a const anyway
[04:33:12] <Voxel> __adrian, would you create an object with contant values and a constructor which would prepare them
[04:33:13] <Voxel> ?
[04:33:18] <Voxel> constant*
[04:33:27] <__adrian> you would not. that is, basically by definition, NOT a constant
[04:33:59] <__adrian> it's not just "oh that doesn't work"
[04:34:03] <BadAdviceCat> I'm trying to get used to just using getter/setters. The main argument is that we can use Interfaces with those unlike properties. But the accessors are suppose to allow us to do that too iirc.
[04:34:12] <__adrian> it's "dude, not what it's for"
[04:34:16] <Voxel> BadAdviceCat, tried to omit getter/setter since it +~250% processing
[04:34:29] <Voxel> __adrian, that's why asking?
[04:34:32] <__adrian> Voxel: no - you're thinking of __get/__set
[04:34:38] <Voxel> ...before proceeding...?
[04:34:45] <Voxel> __adrian, same
[04:34:52] <Voxel> __get/__set +~750
[04:34:54] <Voxel> %
[04:34:59] <__adrian> no, __get/__set  ≠ getter/setter
[04:35:07] <__adrian> you don't have to use the magic methods.
[04:35:14] <Voxel> Yes. That's why +~250% != +~750%
[04:35:29] <__adrian> what?
[04:35:38] <__adrian> getters/setters are just methods.
[04:35:41] <__adrian> like any other.
[04:35:55] <Voxel> The first is custom getter/setter performance, the second - __get/__set.
[04:36:03] <BadAdviceCat> Voxel, I don't care much about performance. PHP is fast enough. What I care about is having to write a bunch of IF/else or using switch() or match(). Rather than the superior and much more concise accessors.
[04:36:09] * __adrian sighs
[04:36:33] <Voxel> __adrian, http://erosbence.blogspot.com/2011/07/getters-setters-performance.html
[04:36:44] <Voxel> I meant these tests
[04:36:45] <__adrian> yeah, that's real old, and also nonsense
[04:36:53] <Voxel> Oh. Of course.
[04:37:04] <__adrian> but going back to your const question
[04:37:14] <BadAdviceCat> Premature Micro Optimization. :( https://blog.ircmaxell.com/2011/08/on-optimization-in-php.html
[04:37:25] <__adrian> if you have to calculate/setup/whatever, it's NOT a constant and you shouldn't use a const.
[04:37:59] <Voxel> The main issue is to prepare something constant and nearly globally available.
[04:38:03] <__adrian> no
[04:38:08] <Voxel> no?
[04:38:14] <Blondie101010> think of 'constant' as the universal law that doesn't change
[04:38:18] <__adrian> constants are not for making things "readonly" or "global"
[04:38:30] <Voxel> By constant I mean to disallow changing it after initialization.
[04:38:33] <Voxel> Somethng like readonly.
[04:38:52] <__adrian> yes, i understand that. that's not what a constant is for.
[04:38:54] <Voxel> Since readonly is unavailable.
[04:39:03] <Blondie101010> is it to the class itself or to other classes (public)?
[04:39:12] <Voxel> To other classes
[04:39:24] <__adrian> tip: only set it once. done.
[04:39:27] <Blondie101010> __get() + __set() is what I'd use
[04:39:58] <Blondie101010> well no __set() needed here
[04:40:01] <Voxel> First idea was to make a static properties and a static method which would prepare them, but it would have empty properties before the method's execution.
[04:40:03] <BadAdviceCat> "Value maintainability over all else." <-- this is what I aim for as I write code. Having to do switches/matches/getter/setters are annoying >.< It is do-able and it works, the solution is fine, but yuck, accessors are better.
[04:40:24] <Voxel> This idea sounds awful though
[04:40:54] <__adrian> well, i think that's all there is to say about it really
[04:40:57] <BadAdviceCat> Voxel, for configs, I just use an array.
[04:42:12] <Voxel> BadAdviceCat, it's an option, of course, but the issue is that these are for paths mostly which are not configurabl, but include configurable directory names.
[04:42:19] <Voxel> For example:
[04:42:58] <BadAdviceCat> A combination of https://gist.github.com/adrian-enspired/434212c1ca2353f4548ff9fb0e24c383 and also https://gist.github.com/adrian-enspired/2e03b01fcfff54151864
[04:43:45] <Voxel> config has customizable theme, but readonly value would be a path to the style directory: $stylesPath="/assets/{$style}/styles/base.css" etc.
[04:44:04] <BadAdviceCat> Actually, just a __DIR__ and that's it
[04:44:16] <Voxel> oops

[04:47:12] <Voxel> How would you make a readonly path based on config values then?
[04:47:25] <Blondie101010> use '/' for directory separator unless you're on a different planet
[04:47:36] <Blondie101010> that would already help
[04:47:37] <__adrian> $config->path("css")
[04:47:59] <Voxel> Basically, it's: root . '/assets/' . $style . '/css'
[04:48:08] <__adrian> yes, i do understand what you're thinking
[04:48:16] <BadAdviceCat> Voxel, frankly, this is beginning to sound like a templating issue.
[04:48:19] <Voxel> __adrian, and this would recalculate the path each time?
[04:48:27] <Voxel> What's behind path?
[04:48:30] <BadAdviceCat> Generally, you shouldn't need to do any of this.
[04:48:30] <Voxel> path()*
[04:48:40] <__adrian> path() is a method that gets paths (by name)
[04:48:42] <Voxel> Why not?
[04:48:49] <__adrian> implementation is not specified
[04:48:54] <Voxel> __adrian, based on what?
[04:49:01] <Voxel> How would it know where it's located
[04:49:03] <Blondie101010> Voxel: `ROOT . "/assets/$style/css"` is how I'd do it, and adrian would add to {$style}
[04:49:10] <BadAdviceCat> Voxel, because you would have 1 layout template file per theme which drastically alters the appearance of your website. That is why.
[04:49:15] <__adrian> tl;dr: i don't care, "however"

[05:02:26] *** Joins: Nekomander (~BadAdvice@user/badadvicecat)
[05:05:19] <cyanLicoriceGuy> I am programming a textadventure in PHP8. So I got a class Location and a class Item. I want to implement some special code for some individual objects of Location and Items, not all Items or Location have that code
[05:05:49] <Nekomander> Voxel, here: https://dpaste.com/8KDNM8RCD
[05:05:56] <cyanLicoriceGuy> I've discovered Closures so you can add functions
[05:06:04] *** Quits: BadAdviceCat (~BadAdvice@user/badadvicecat) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[05:06:23] <Nekomander> This is an example of what I am talking about, and why a cssPath variable may not be necessary.
[05:07:37] <Nekomander> So basically. You would instead have 1 html layout for each CSS theme/site layout you wish to support.
[05:07:44] <__adrian> cyanLicoriceGuy: a Strategy pattern might be appropriate, but don't use anon functions as ad-hoc methods. if you have a variation of a class that needs a different method, you make a subclass.
[05:08:11] <Nekomander> Each layout would be in charge of deciding the paths to their  own CSS/static files.
[05:08:51] <cyanLicoriceGuy> I made a function setChallenge(Closure $chall):void to set the code for an instance of Location but it says it cannot acces before innitiation
[05:08:56] <Voxel> Nekomander, of course, but would you copy "/templates/pages/" everywhere? What if theme is not in the same directory? What if theme directory includes an additional dynamic value?
[05:09:24] <cyanLicoriceGuy> yeah i got subclasses that extend Item
[05:09:40] <cyanLicoriceGuy> e.g. Key extends Item
[05:10:17] <Voxel> The issue raised was to store somewhere a path like: $config['baseDir'] .'/templates/pages/';, and then just use it in the code like $pages . '/' . $whichWebPage
[05:10:22] <cyanLicoriceGuy> so an instance of key can be "used" with an instance of Door [extends Item]
[05:10:27] <Voxel> $pagesUrl*
[05:10:27] <__adrian> cyanLicoriceGuy: does every variation need the same method (setChallenge()) but would implement it differently?
[05:10:50] <__adrian> or do different variations actually need different methods?
[05:11:17] <Voxel> So to not copy a possibly customizable path part like '/template' or '/pages'.
[05:12:02] <cyanLicoriceGuy> well it would be nice if the challange is different to different locations. Maybe you first have to clean the dishes in the kitchen before you leave it
[05:12:27] <__adrian> that's not really what i'm asking
[05:12:47] <__adrian> is the code always $challenge->setChallenge(), but it might do differnt things?
[05:12:58] <cyanLicoriceGuy> with setChallenge($chall) i want to set $this->mChallenge
[05:13:06] <Voxel> Nekomander, something like: $config['templatesDir'] = $config['baseDir'] . '/templates'; $config['pages'] = $config['templatesDir'] . '/pages';
[05:13:16] <Voxel> ['pagesDir']*
[05:13:26] <__adrian> that sounds like setChallenge() would always do the same thing
[05:13:50] <Nekomander> Voxel,  all the code would be in /templates period. so the extra keystrokes is not a big deal.
[05:14:04] <Voxel> However it would not make a sense I guess since it's not part of config, but only some its parts, and that's why wanted to have something separately from config.
[05:14:19] <cyanLicoriceGuy> i want to put a function as a param in setChallenge()
[05:14:22] <__adrian> > then just use it in the code  // Voxel, this is part of why $config->path() is a good idea. it keeps all that code in one place, and you don't have to keep track of it scattered everywhere
[05:14:26] <Nekomander> And you only need to set this Once for each base template file. Realistically, you probably will only have 2 or 3. Then any more will be created by other people.
[05:14:43] <__adrian> cyanLicoriceGuy: so, that sounds like setChallenge() would always do the same thing. yes?
[05:15:02] <Voxel> Nekomander, the problem is that not just '/pages' would exist in '/templates', but '/templates/styles' or '/templates/scripts' for example
[05:15:09] <cyanLicoriceGuy> yes it shall change the challenge for the location
[05:15:14] <Voxel> Would you copy '/templates' string everywhere?
[05:15:16] <__adrian> and then you'd use $myChallenge later (e.g., $challenge->doChallenge())?
[05:16:02] <__adrian> Voxel: you'd index those, so your code can ask for it.  e.g.,  $config->path()
[05:16:06] <__adrian> Voxel: you'd index those, so your code can ask for it.  e.g.,  $config->path("images")
[05:16:09] <cyanLicoriceGuy> maybe if the kitchen is "dish clean" a new challenge would be to put it in the cupboard
[05:16:28] <cyanLicoriceGuy> (the dises in the kitchen
[05:16:30] <__adrian> cyanLicoriceGuy: please see my question
[05:16:41] <__adrian> cyanLicoriceGuy: so, that sounds like setChallenge() would always do the same thing. yes?
[05:16:44] <__adrian> and then you'd use $myChallenge later (e.g., $challenge->doChallenge())?
[05:16:48] <__adrian> ^
[05:16:58] <Voxel> __adrian, perhaps, but I don't see how an indexing would work currently.
[05:17:00] <__adrian> is that accurate?
[05:17:06] <cyanLicoriceGuy> __adrian yes.
[05:17:14] <Voxel> How would the website know where 'images' are stored in the first place..
[05:17:17] <__adrian> cyanLicoriceGuy: cool. that's a _Strategy_ pattern.
[05:17:21] *** Joins: The_Blode_ (~Blode@user/the-blode/x-7164444)
[05:17:24] <__adrian> yes, it's fine.
[05:17:33] <Voxel> if ($path == 'images')?
[05:17:42] <cyanLicoriceGuy> yeah the way like doChallenge()
[05:18:07] <__adrian> Voxel: no. in your config, you'd define the path for images.  e.g., "images" => "{$root}/assets/images"
[05:18:17] <cyanLicoriceGuy> but doChallenge is depending on what is the challange for THIS Location now
[05:18:23] <__adrian> then path("images") would return that.
[05:18:29] <Voxel> __adrian, but how? The config is an array, currently.
[05:18:55] <__adrian> maybe  ->path("images", "foo.png")  would return  "{$root}/assets/images/foo.png"
[05:19:08] <Voxel> I mean, that's why tried to make an additional logic for such readonly  values which would contain these config array values.
[05:19:13] <__adrian> obviously, if you had a config class, you would keep the config there
[05:19:17] <Nekomander> Voxel, but for the sake of completion and to satisfy your urge to exclude the word "template" from the string, You can do this instead: https://dpaste.com/G5DESZSCL
[05:19:32] <__adrian> "that's why"  what's why, now?
[05:20:01] <Voxel> __adrian, indeed a class for config exists too. It has a custom getter, but just for an array.
[05:20:52] <Voxel> Indeed there was an idea to include readonly prepared values into this class, hence the question how to prepare it: using a separate class or inside the config class (in its constructor, for example).
[05:21:16] <Voxel> Assuming that, would it store these prepared values in private properties.
[05:23:13] <__adrian> cyanLicoriceGuy: https://3v4l.org/BSadh  ← this is a strategy pattern. the process (set, then do) is always the same. what actually gets done can be different.
[05:23:20] <cyanLicoriceGuy> well the Location class is like class Location { private Closure $mChallenge; ... ; doChall() {return $mChallenge;} but this gives me an error: cannot be accessed before bein initiated
[05:24:01] <__adrian> > cannot be accessed before bein initiated  // that's why my example throws. you're trying to _use_ something that _doesn't exist yet_.
[05:24:17] <__adrian> you need to set() FIRST, THEN you can do().
[05:24:25] <Voxel> __adrian, '/assets' and '/images' are the parts which would be stored somewhere. In case of private properties it would be something like: private $assetsDir; ... $this->assetsDir = ROOT . '/assets'; // and then path() would return it.
[05:24:44] <__adrian> sure
[05:24:49] <__adrian> that's one way
[05:25:17] <__adrian> s/throws/checks and throws/
[05:25:19] <Nekomander> Voxel, /pages/ doesn't need to be changes because it's a server-side script where the template files are where they should be at. The only thing that could change would be the location of pictures and other assets as it can be loaded from an entirely different domain, such as a CDN. The question then becomes, Are you going to really have all of your assets scattered everywhere? - Normally, the assets would just come with the software, and then
[05:25:20] <Voxel> How would path know it's assets and not a core file i.e.?
[05:25:20] <Nekomander> additional assets would be bootstrap frontend framework, or similar loaded from a third party domain. If that's really necessary, one could create a config for each theme to add 1 asset at a time for CSS/JS.
[05:25:24] <cyanLicoriceGuy> is my mistake to make it private and i shall make it protected?
[05:25:32] <Voxel> This would need a second parameter then
[05:25:52] <__adrian> Voxel: that's up to you. presumably the "images" path would  include the "assets" path
[05:26:06] <__adrian> cyanLicoriceGuy: "__adrian> you need to set() FIRST, THEN you can do()"
[05:26:15] <__adrian> see line 20 in my example
[05:26:24] <__adrian> if you remmove that, then it will have the same problem.
[05:26:29] <Voxel> Nekomander, the mission is to not copy/paste the same path everywhere, but its single reference
[05:26:33] <__adrian> https://3v4l.org/VF9p1
[05:26:39] <cyanLicoriceGuy> yeah i wanted to set first
[05:26:54] <cyanLicoriceGuy> but not all Locations have a challenge
[05:27:06] <Voxel> Of course, it a back-end side, but...
[05:27:17] <cyanLicoriceGuy> (special code done with that Location or Item)
[05:27:22] <__adrian> then check, as my example does. and instead of throwing, just skip it if there's no challenge.
[05:27:40] <Nekomander> Voxel, flexibility vs conventions (not having to copy paste) are 2 different approaches that collides. Do you understand my point? Configuration vs conventions.
[05:27:40] <__adrian> https://3v4l.org/dPSEr
[05:28:32] <cyanLicoriceGuy> can't i say in constructor $this->mChallenge = null;?
[05:28:49] <cyanLicoriceGuy> by default this extra code is not given
[05:28:58] <cyanLicoriceGuy> but some may have it
[05:29:11] <__adrian> not if you're typehinting it (and you should)
[05:29:11] <cyanLicoriceGuy> oh now i see
[05:29:41] <__adrian> or you could set a default function, if that made sense for your use
[05:29:43] <Nekomander> Voxel, you're not copy pasting the same path everywhere. Each theme file can be written once and that's it. If one wants to re-use the header/menu, that can split off into a separate template file that each template includes.
[05:29:47] <cyanLicoriceGuy> it must exist, because it might be that the doChall() is called but meets null
[05:30:22] *** Quits: vlm (~vlm@user/vlm) (Quit: "")
[05:30:25] <__adrian> "cyanLicoriceGuy> it must exist"  no, not really. again, see my example above
[05:30:40] <Voxel> Nekomander, the theme may have 2, 3, 9, +99 places with '/templates/assets/' directory mentioned.
[05:30:58] <Nekomander> Voxel, there are many examples here: https://platesphp.com/getting-started/simple-example/ and https://platesphp.com/templates/layouts/
[05:31:09] <Nekomander> Voxel, HTTP can not read or "see" /templates.
[05:31:18] <cyanLicoriceGuy> is typehinting say String $aString = "abc" rather than just $aString="abc"? yes i love this in PHP8
[05:31:26] <Voxel> Nekomander, PHP template too
[05:31:36] <__adrian> cyanLicoriceGuy: yes
[05:31:41] <Nekomander> Assets do not belong in the "templates" folder. I made a mistake.
[05:32:09] <Voxel> Any directory which is related to a template anyways.
[05:32:48] <Voxel> It may be mentioned in PHP template more than 1 times, thus I don't see a reason to copy/paste the same path in them, but create a single reference and use it.
[05:32:48] *** Joins: vlm (~vlm@user/vlm)
[05:32:51] <Voxel> That's the point.
[05:33:19] <Voxel> ...create somehow a single readonly reference to require asset directories and use it in templates universally.
[05:33:27] <cyanLicoriceGuy> so i must write a chall for all but it should look like setChallenge(function() { /* I do nothing here */ });?
[05:33:28] <Voxel> required*
[05:33:55] <cyanLicoriceGuy> the first Location has no chall, but the 2nd has
[05:34:00] <__adrian> <img src="<?= $config->asset("images", "foo.png")"/>  <img src="<?= $config->asset("images", "bar.png")"/>
[05:34:09] <__adrian> cyanLicoriceGuy: look at the example i shared
[05:34:21] <cyanLicoriceGuy> so it only complains because the 1st does not have?
[05:34:58] <Voxel> __adrian, config may contain database settings.
[05:35:16] <Voxel> Additional point is that I wanted to isolate such data from the config and view part.
[05:35:28] <Voxel> between config and view
[05:35:29] <__adrian> "__adrian> > cannot be accessed before bein initiated  // ... you're trying to _use_ something that _doesn't exist yet_."

[05:45:48] <Voxel> I'll try to read about some implementations
[05:46:24] <Nekomander> twig, and platesphp template engine makes this possible with a custom function for it. There may also already be asset support in there.
[05:46:39] <Nekomander> Voxel, do you use template engines by any chance?
[05:46:54] <Voxel> A custom one, indeed.
[05:47:23] <Nekomander> https://web.archive.org/web/20170917133705/http://chadminick.com/articles/simple-php-template-engine.html <-- this is the general idea of what I'm trying to get across.
[05:47:30] <Voxel> All in all, the main issue is to store somewhere paths wit configurable directory names. That's it.

[06:30:11] <cyanLicoriceGuy> yeah ih think i mustn't or can't run cron jobs or link script executions
[06:30:36] <Voxel> +electricty bills, and some ISP may have restrictions.
[06:30:56] <Voxel> Also, are you sure you want to highlight your personal IP out there etc.
[06:31:34] <Voxel> cyanLicoriceGuy, it depends on VPS provider. Some can. As mentioned above, DigitalOcean provides a root shell.
[06:32:30] <cyanLicoriceGuy> i loved cjb.net freehosting a bit, but they discontinued
[06:32:33] <Voxel> It's expected them to run multiple isolated containers/virtual machines on the same shared physical machine with organized resources between clients/customers, so
[06:32:54] <Voxel> freehosting is usually big no no for responsible projects
[06:33:06] <cyanLicoriceGuy> i had an email of whatiwant@myhomepage.cjb.net
[06:33:14] <cyanLicoriceGuy> but cjb is gone:(
[06:33:50] <cyanLicoriceGuy> was subdomain, but it did had email with that domain
[06:33:59] <Nekomander> relipse, https://dpaste.com/5BXFYQ4W4 you would create a folder. Then after that, create app.js (or index.js or whatever) - Depending on the file name you've saved this as, then run in terminal: `node app.js`
[06:34:01] <Voxel> You can setup your own Email server (i.e. postfix + dovecot), but it'll require a normal DNS server, Dmarc, SPF, and some additonal configuration knowledge which is also gatherable)
[06:34:04] <cyanLicoriceGuy> i think most dinosauers died out
[06:34:29] <Nekomander> Then browse to http://127.0.0.1:3000/
[06:35:45] <cyanLicoriceGuy> that wd destroy the joke of make it accecible worldwide, if on localhost
[06:35:58] <Voxel> cyanLicoriceGuy, it's not hard to setup your own Email server. I believe, for a newcomer, a week and you have it running well (incoming/outgoing + authorization) with mostly no spam flag issues.
[06:36:04] <Nekomander> relipse, inside your project folder, you would run: `npm install` command and see info here: https://github.com/websockets/ws toy around with it, etc. npm is like PHP's composer.
[06:36:40] <relipse> Nekomander: I want to try in PHP
[06:36:44] <cyanLicoriceGuy> yeah but that needs a paiddomain
[06:37:10] <Nekomander> relipse, the reason I suggest js, because most of the how-to resources is here.
[06:37:34] <relipse> That makes me want to try in PHP
[06:37:58] <cyanLicoriceGuy> sooner or later u need both php and js
[06:37:59] <Nekomander> Well, happy coding ^_^
[06:38:10] <Voxel> ISP + firewall for 25 + postfix; 587, 993 ports + dovecot; Domain + DNS specific records, Dmarc, SPF, and you nearly have t.
[06:38:22] <cyanLicoriceGuy> I love PHP because the surfer does not need it on his client
[06:38:53] <cyanLicoriceGuy> but it cannot do dynamacs like scrolling or keyevents
[06:39:11] <Voxel> PHP is frekaing magnificent, but assumes a crystal understanding what are you doing since firstly raw ideas may result in critical security and performance issues.
[06:39:13] <cyanLicoriceGuy> so i use a bridge: AJAX
[06:40:13] <Voxel> cyanLicoriceGuy, what do you mean it can't do dynamics?
[06:40:40] <cyanLicoriceGuy> i was so proud my websites had no js. but here i have it... only to get keyevents
[06:40:45] <Voxel> It's back-end solution. Ajax is back-end + front-end.
[06:41:17] <cyanLicoriceGuy> scrolling, keyevents, mouseevents, without reloading
[06:41:18] <Voxel> Ajax or old XMLHttpRequest is a request from front-end to back-end.
[06:41:29] <cyanLicoriceGuy> and that is where AJAX helps
[06:41:44] <Voxel> cyanLicoriceGuy, you are talking about front-end. It's not the purpose of PHP in the first place.
[06:41:57] <cyanLicoriceGuy> yeah
[06:42:09] <Nekomander> It's nice that websockets and such can be opened using any backend language. But if you want support for certain features/framework, javascript is the go-to place for this which makes the work easier.
[06:42:23] <Voxel> Once more. Ajax is browser thing. It's not server side solution, but usually assumes a server.
[06:42:36] <cyanLicoriceGuy> disadvantage of JS: the visitor can see sourcecode
[06:43:42] <Nekomander> cyanLicoriceGuy, there is server-side javascript. You can run it yourself if you want to. You just need to have npm/node installed: https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/getting-started-guide/
[06:43:53] <cyanLicoriceGuy> and it seems to be a bit ironic for me to make a textadventure on the web, using PHP (and ajax for the IPO)
[06:44:21] <cyanLicoriceGuy> (ok the processing is in php again), output allways html
[06:44:22] <Voxel> websocket/ajax/fetch/whatever is browser side. PHP is on server. PHP is to Hypertext Preprocessor. It's generally used to prepare data for browser or any client either for HTTP or any traffic.
[06:44:47] <Voxel> Front-end != Back-end.
[06:44:51] <Nekomander> cyanLicoriceGuy, are you emailing? I hope you are not using the mail() function. Especially without understanding how to deal with header injection attacks.
[06:45:06] <Voxel> Node is both. Node is written on JS. Ajax != JS.
[06:45:14] <cyanLicoriceGuy> i am not certain whether i could install software on my freewebspace
[06:45:14] <Voxel> XMLHttpRequest != JS.
[06:45:17] <cyanLicoriceGuy> i doubt
[06:45:55] <Nekomander> cyanLicoriceGuy, what are you trying to install? o_O
[06:46:08] <cyanLicoriceGuy> mail() is bullshit here. my free provider only offers 100 mails per day or was i per month?
[06:46:19] <Voxel> mail is changable.
[06:46:31] <Voxel> in php.ini
[06:46:45] <Voxel> It may be anything literally.
[06:46:53] <cyanLicoriceGuy> nekomander i mustn't
[06:47:05] <cyanLicoriceGuy> someone said sth like node.js
[06:47:14] <Voxel> Usually, it's sendmail program.
[06:47:41] <Voxel> Nekomander, headers can be checked on Email server side.
[06:47:58] <cyanLicoriceGuy> i thnk it were possible to use another SMTP service, but i didn't try it out yet
[06:47:59] <Voxel> I.e. postfix configs may require SASL
[06:48:34] <cyanLicoriceGuy> i think i got no access on php.ini
[06:48:56] <cyanLicoriceGuy> i think i have no soccets
[06:49:11] <cyanLicoriceGuy> because all this costs traffic
[06:49:27] <Nekomander> velix, speaking of serializing, you might be interested in this drop-in replacement: https://github.com/igbinary/igbinary
[06:49:40] <Voxel> cyanLicoriceGuy, welp, the defauly mail() is changeable only in the ini file. It does't allow in code ini_set(). However, it's possible to send Email using PHP power of course. For example, PHPMailer should help investigating.
[06:49:43] <velix> Nekomander: Yeah. I'll also have a look at this.
[06:49:51] <velix> Nekomander: There are also some interesting highspeed JSON parsers.
[06:50:44] <Nekomander> cyanLicoriceGuy, mustn't what?
[06:50:48] <cyanLicoriceGuy> yeah but i also thing there was a phpFunction to login on a smtp account with username, password, smtp-server details
[06:51:16] <cyanLicoriceGuy> then it has another name
[06:51:39] *** Joins: Rockwood (~Rocky@user/rocky)
[06:51:39] <cyanLicoriceGuy> be it sendSMTPMail() or however
[06:52:08] <cyanLicoriceGuy> similar to connect to mysql
[06:52:12] <Nekomander> cyanLicoriceGuy, https://symfony.com/doc/current/mailer.html or https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer are great email libraries that you can use. Those handles email headers elegantly.
[06:52:20] <Rockwood> Nekomander, o/
[06:52:33] <Nekomander> Hi Rockwood \o
[06:52:58] <Voxel> cyanLicoriceGuy, by default, PHP has only mail() which uses sendmail Message Transfer Agent (MTA)
[06:53:00] <cyanLicoriceGuy> yeah the how to do is another aspact
[06:53:16] <Voxel> sendmail is a third-party program
[06:53:33] <cyanLicoriceGuy> but the issu is i only got 100 mails per day on webspace host
[06:54:01] <cyanLicoriceGuy> so i think a better way were to connect on one like yahoo
[06:54:03] <Nekomander> cyanLicoriceGuy, do you run PHP on your own computer for the sole purpose of testing your scripts and such? (offline website testing.)
[06:54:34] <cyanLicoriceGuy> no
[06:54:43] <Voxel> cyanLicoriceGuy, "sendmail_path" in php.ini. It is PHP_INI_SYSTEM ( Entry can be set in php.ini or httpd.conf)
[06:54:53] <cyanLicoriceGuy> i upload them onto the freeWebhoster via ftp
[06:54:55] <Voxel> Related: https://www.php.net/manual/en/configuration.changes.modes.php; https://www.php.net/manual/en/mail.configuration.php#ini.sendmail-path
[06:55:38] <Voxel> By default, it points to "/usr/sbin/sendmail -t -i". Some packages includes sendmail which doesn't support "-i" argument.
[06:55:49] <Voxel> include*
[06:56:04] <cyanLicoriceGuy> yeah sendmail
[06:56:36] <cyanLicoriceGuy> i once had a free hoster where mail() did not work because it hat no sendmail activated
[06:56:43] <Voxel> cyanLicoriceGuy, sendSMTPMail() sounds like a custom library
[06:56:53] <Voxel> I.e. PHPMailer as mentioned above.
[06:57:03] <Voxel> https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer
[06:57:10] <Blondie101010> that's sane delegation...  the PHP worker's job is definitely not to process mail delivery
[06:57:12] <cyanLicoriceGuy> i don't kow the name, but it was a built in php funtion
[06:57:24] <Voxel> ^
[06:58:21] <cyanLicoriceGuy> it were nice for purpose of driving or holding a community. to have a password forgotten thing
[06:58:39] *** Quits: ProfSimm (~ProfSimm@87.227.196.109) (Remote host closed the connection)
[06:58:58] <Voxel> Well, of course. However, PHP may use a third-party or independend Mail system to process that.
[06:59:10] <cyanLicoriceGuy> but community is rather away of my focus
[06:59:23] <cyanLicoriceGuy> (on a free space)
[06:59:29] <Voxel> PHP may be self efficient ot use third parties since it has an access to raw shell too.
[06:59:44] <Voxel> s/ot/or/
[07:00:27] <Voxel> Some might say, it's one of the most flexible high level OOP language.
[07:00:42] <Voxel> Not compilable though.
[07:00:53] <Voxel> *usually*
[07:01:41] <cyanLicoriceGuy> i think i got such an ugly email addy at the free hoster like for_abuse_it_was_by_account@websiteprovider.detf.co or whatever
[07:02:16] <Voxel> It looks more like a hosting abuse report Email
[07:02:24] <cyanLicoriceGuy> because you mustn't abuse the service for mass mailing
[07:02:42] <Voxel> Of course. It's a common method.
[07:02:55] <Voxel> i.e. WHOIS usually contain the same for domains.
[07:03:22] <cyanLicoriceGuy> voxel that is where the mail comes from when i use the mail() funtion...
[07:03:47] <cyanLicoriceGuy> i cannot change the adress on the free hostig servie
[07:04:01] <Voxel> Did mail() support custom "From: " header there?
[07:04:19] <Rockwood> cyanLicoriceGuy, which one you using for hosting?
[07:04:26] <Blondie101010> of course you can set any header
[07:04:35] <cyanLicoriceGuy> it's a german one
[07:04:41] <cyanLicoriceGuy> bplaced.net
[07:04:51] <Voxel> i.e. https://www.hostgator.com/help/article/php-email-from-header
[07:05:15] <Voxel> Blondie101010, what if their hosting regex replaced it lol
[07:05:21] <Rockwood> cyanLicoriceGuy, https://www.freehostia.com/ try this one
[07:05:25] <cyanLicoriceGuy> voxel that is spoofing. the return header tells the real one
[07:05:40] <Voxel> What?
[07:05:48] <Rockwood> i think they have mail option in free
[07:05:50] <Voxel> The reply?
[07:05:54] *** Quits: Nekomander (~BadAdvice@user/badadvicecat) (Ping timeout: 250 seconds)
[07:06:00] *** Joins: BadAdviceCat (~BadAdvice@user/badadvicecat)
[07:06:28] <Voxel> cyanLicoriceGuy, anyways, it should be possible to use a custom SMTP server/account on free hostings. However, it usually assumes storing there credentials.
[07:06:55] <Voxel> s/SMTP/MSA/
[07:07:28] <cyanLicoriceGuy> voxel so IF and only if i want mail, so far i think i should use a yahoo adress... its just small project
[07:08:12] <cyanLicoriceGuy> it's not for bussiness, only for hobby/non-profit
[07:08:12] <Voxel> Since SMTP is for raw communications. Authorization is usually SASL, therefore a normal message submission agent (MSA)/submission like Dovecot.
[07:09:02] <Blondie101010> yahoo email has been hacked repeatedly
[07:09:30] <cyanLicoriceGuy> i love the free offer of heiohost or whatever the name was
[07:09:41] <cyanLicoriceGuy> heliohost
[07:09:52] <cyanLicoriceGuy> (not tried yet)
[07:09:54] <Voxel> cyanLicoriceGuy, in such case, I'd suggest to create a new account for the tet project, and check its activity regularly since the shady free hosting may try to record credentials over custom TLS/SLL communication or just get them from raw sources.
[07:10:48] <cyanLicoriceGuy> why?
[07:10:59] <cyanLicoriceGuy> it runs 99.9%
[07:12:03] <BadAdviceCat> cyanLicoriceGuy, which OS do you use by the way, and the amount of RAM installed?
[07:12:40] <cyanLicoriceGuy> yeah security is another thing lol. my sourcecode (for homepage) does wor but it's a mess lol
[07:12:56] <cyanLicoriceGuy> i am working on refactoring
[07:12:56] <Voxel> Free hosting for 24 hours! 256 MHz, 256 MB, and 10 MB traffic! Limited offer! /s
[07:13:29] <BadAdviceCat> Voxel, is that for testing?
[07:13:45] <Voxel> That's for shady activity, I believe.
[07:13:55] <cyanLicoriceGuy> i am typing on an android tablet. i manage it with an app, but i also could do this with win 10
[07:14:11] <cyanLicoriceGuy> (for ftp upload)
[07:14:35] <cyanLicoriceGuy> bplaced runs on linux
[07:14:40] <BadAdviceCat> cyanLicoriceGuy, Which version of PHP is your host using?
[07:14:45] <Voxel> cyanLicoriceGuy, I'd suggest you either get a cheap entry level normal VPS or even better build your own local one either virtual or physical.
[07:16:46] <cyanLicoriceGuy> badadvicecat the fun is, i can set the php version. I had it on php5.6 and then jumped to PHP8. and now i get so many warnings because deprececated. but new features too:)
[07:17:17] <Voxel> i.e. complete set on curent OS or Docker for virtual; physical: Raspberry Pi, Orange Pi etc. or (non-)cheap system like Mobo + Celeron/Pentium/etc. with PAE support + 2+ GB RAM.
[07:18:04] <Voxel> I mean, it's realatively easy to have a local PHP environment for tests.
[07:18:21] <Voxel> Do you have any reason to have an actual machine for tests?
[07:18:36] <Voxel> Does it require an additional public IP address?
[07:18:55] <cyanLicoriceGuy> php used to be similar to JS: no types. but now it has types like String $string = "abc"; so that $string will always be a string
[07:18:58] <Voxel> Does it require database?
[07:19:02] <cyanLicoriceGuy> unlike in js
[07:19:14] <Voxel> JS has TypeScript
[07:19:49] <Voxel> I'd prefer typed languages in most cases.
[07:20:03] <cyanLicoriceGuy> voxel no
[07:20:05] <Voxel> C#, C++, PHP, TS <3
[07:20:17] <cyanLicoriceGuy> typescript is by micro$oft
[07:20:23] <cyanLicoriceGuy> is bullshit
[07:20:27] <Voxel> ..
[07:20:47] <cyanLicoriceGuy> TSC compiles TS code to JS. i only say type erasure
[07:21:25] <Voxel> C# is by MS too, but is incredible IMHO. Curently, is rarely used though, but is very awesome.
[07:22:23] <Voxel> Anyways, it's #php so, let's try to be on topic ^^
[07:22:28] <cyanLicoriceGuy> i say string mystring = "abc". TSC makes JS so it is only mystring="abc". it forgets that mystring is a sring is then a mixed
[07:22:50] <cyanLicoriceGuy> in php8 i have the feature ike in Java
[07:22:52] <Voxel> TS checks types while compiling
[07:22:57] <Voxel> "compiling"*
[07:23:37] <cyanLicoriceGuy> hehe
[07:23:52] <cyanLicoriceGuy> it translates TS to JS
[07:23:55] <Voxel> In others words, it's assumed that the code is written in TS, but only the result is JS which is published.
[07:24:31] <cyanLicoriceGuy> yeah
[07:24:45] <cyanLicoriceGuy> the output of TSC will be js
[07:25:13] <BadAdviceCat> cyanLicoriceGuy, for all the PHP code that you have on your website, did you write all of that yourself? Or is it a few installed php apps?
[07:25:31] <cyanLicoriceGuy> the only advantage is syntactic sugar in Typescript
[07:25:44] <cyanLicoriceGuy> it looks nicer
[07:25:48] <cyanLicoriceGuy> maybe
[07:26:22] <cyanLicoriceGuy> i wat to bake my own cake. no CMS
[07:26:58] <cyanLicoriceGuy> so it has issues. but i can develop it or realing the code
[07:28:14] <cyanLicoriceGuy> well, i put in a bbcode module by chriskonnerz and extended it for my purposes
[07:31:59] <cyanLicoriceGuy> some pieces were public domain
[07:33:41] <cyanLicoriceGuy> for a long time i put most things in index.php. but it's madness
[07:34:53] <cyanLicoriceGuy> now i have more files like for header with includes and nessesaries as like one for the head banner on top of the site
[07:36:13] <cyanLicoriceGuy> for sandbox projects i made subdirectories

[07:47:07] <BadAdviceCat> cyanLicoriceGuy, okay. Let's get on Windows 10.  I can show you how to set up PHP locally the sane way.
[07:48:01] <cyanLicoriceGuy> thx but i don't need it on my own home lan
[07:49:35] <cyanLicoriceGuy> there are some software servers like xampp or similar that offer php, mysql, but not worldwide
[07:50:13] <cyanLicoriceGuy> unless i let the pc run nights and days
[07:50:43] <BadAdviceCat> cyanLicoriceGuy, you would run it on your own computer. Then access it like this https://ibb.co/9cwzjjd
[07:50:46] <cyanLicoriceGuy> rather i buy raspberry pi 5 or whatever ;)
[07:51:41] <BadAdviceCat> It's not for hosting. It's for yourself for testing it offline. That's the point of local development. You also get greater control. Unlike what you get with the freehosting.
[07:52:26] <cyanLicoriceGuy> indeed.
[07:52:58] <BadAdviceCat> PHP can run from a Virtual Machine. Cleaning up is simple. How you may ask? Delete the virtual machine. Your code will live outside the virtual machine, BUT it is virtually shared to the virtual machine. So that means the virtual machien will have access to the code too.
[07:53:26] <BadAdviceCat> Your code will still be on your Windows Machine.
[07:53:38] <cyanLicoriceGuy> i already mentioned, it's ironic to run a textadveture on the websphere

[07:59:36] <__adrian> cyanLicoriceGuy: the "serialization" error is because you can't serialize anon functions.
[07:59:41] <cyanLicoriceGuy> yeah because Hypertext already offers pictures, links and so on
[07:59:52] <cyanLicoriceGuy> yeah

[08:03:29] <cyanLicoriceGuy> you could add new tags by addTag(function() {/* code for that bb-tag */})
[08:03:48] <__adrian> cyanLicoriceGuy: that ^ is not a good pattern

[08:12:01] <cyanLicoriceGuy> else {return "This is the wrong key";} for example
[08:12:35] <cyanLicoriceGuy> just checking on the Item's name
[08:13:19] <cyanLicoriceGuy> and it worked
[08:15:52] <cyanLicoriceGuy> but what happens when the player types "use [item]"? it depends on what kind of item it is and then again the ID (name) of it
[08:17:01] <cyanLicoriceGuy> that would result in may if, elseif, else or swich case lines, i think

[08:17:59] <__adrian> i'm not sure what you're asking (or if you're asking)
[08:18:15] <__adrian> if you've got a question, think it through a bit and clarify
[08:18:53] <cyanLicoriceGuy> "use brown chair" would be different to "use basement door"
[08:20:38] <__adrian> what's your question/use case? e.g., are you offering your user a choice (like a dropdown) and you want to do something based on their response?
[08:22:14] <cyanLicoriceGuy> i want to change the useItem() for instances of item, not only for Item extending classes
[08:23:39] <__adrian> we need to understand what you want to accomplish - not how you've decided is the best way to do it. forget about code/solutions for a moment, and explain the problem you want to solve. what's your use case? and what do you want to be able to do?
[08:23:58] <cyanLicoriceGuy> is it possible to overwrite it for objects or only for child classes?
[08:24:22] <__adrian> yeah, you need to drop this idea of adding/removing/changing methods on an object at runtime
[08:24:32] <__adrian> that's NOT how you do it. methods go on classes.
[08:25:11] <Blondie101010> you could define functionality through interfaces
[08:25:17] <__adrian> ^
[08:26:31] <cyanLicoriceGuy> well i need different behavior for a pocket lamp than for a key
[08:26:50] <__adrian> that means a pocket lamp and a key are NOT instances of the same class
[08:27:52] <cyanLicoriceGuy> the classes extend Item
[08:28:28] <cyanLicoriceGuy> but even two keys are not the same keys
[08:28:45] <__adrian> yes, that would be two instances of a Key
[08:28:49] <cyanLicoriceGuy> so each one needs another behaviour
[08:28:56] <__adrian> no
[08:29:05] <__adrian> same behavior. insert in lock, turn.
[08:29:07] <cyanLicoriceGuy> (or return String)
[08:29:22] *** Joins: epony (epony@user/epony)
[08:29:29] <__adrian> they would have different characteristics. different patterns, different locks they fit in.
[08:29:46] <__adrian> $key1->fitsLock($lock) //false
[08:29:51] <__adrian> $key2->fitsLock($lock) //true
[08:30:03] <cyanLicoriceGuy> or what about doors.
[08:30:19] <cyanLicoriceGuy> some doors have no keyhole.
[08:30:28] <__adrian> sure?
[08:30:32] <__adrian> what are you arguing?
[08:30:51] <Blondie101010> cyanLicoriceGuy:  it sounds like you're beginning a very long project...  take a lot of notes
[08:31:04] <__adrian> $door->hasLock() // returns true if door has lock, false otherwise
[08:31:36] <cyanLicoriceGuy> Blondie101010 yeah i think so
[08:31:46] <__adrian> $door->isLocked() // true is locked; false if not locked or has no lock
[08:31:53] <__adrian> s/is/if/
[08:32:17] <cyanLicoriceGuy> ok well i implemented the Key2Door pair.
[08:32:33] <Blondie101010> can't a key open something else?
[08:33:34] <cyanLicoriceGuy> but this is made by checking whether it's name is "black key", "blue key", "broken key", "key atrappe"
[08:33:39] <Blondie101010> 'key' opens 'lock', not door
[08:33:50] <Blondie101010> door implements lock
[08:33:54] <__adrian> cyanLicoriceGuy: no
[08:34:07] <__adrian> you can't grab any random key and label it "front door" and expect it to work
[08:34:48] <cyanLicoriceGuy> Blondie101010 indeed i had it in mind.  might be a box. you cannot go through a box to change currentLocation
[08:35:11] <__adrian> depends on the story
[08:36:42] <cyanLicoriceGuy> i also have no go or go south or n,s,w,e yet. i think it's better to use it by Location's names
[08:37:46] <cyanLicoriceGuy> __adrian in real life not. but adventure games want you to do some crazy things...
[08:39:10] <cyanLicoriceGuy> althou i have a class Exit (remamed because exit is a php keyword)
[08:41:38] <cyanLicoriceGuy> the challenge of developing is to limit possibilities the protagonist does not know in a state and show him/her things when he/she get a hin in game

[08:48:34] <cyanLicoriceGuy> alternative to bbcode?
[08:48:53] <cyanLicoriceGuy> html is worse too
[08:48:56] <BadAdviceCat> <BadAdviceCat> If you want to do BBCode, you should use this instead. https://github.com/s9e/TextFormatter  This also comes with Markdown support.
[08:49:30] <cyanLicoriceGuy> what is markdown?
[08:51:11] <cyanLicoriceGuy> well i missed h1,h2,h3 in chrisconnerz bbcode so i added it
[08:51:25] <BadAdviceCat> Small project, big project, virtual machine is awesome regardless. Live testing code on a server is either going to be slow, OR restrictive.
[08:52:07] <BadAdviceCat> Markdown is another way to format text. Similarly how BBCode is done.
[08:52:38] <BadAdviceCat> https://dillinger.io/ <-- here is an example of what markdown looks like.

[08:56:03] <cyanLicoriceGuy> thx. nice.
[08:57:07] <cyanLicoriceGuy> i've also looked at PEAR but not tried yet
[08:57:18] <BadAdviceCat> The primary point of this is to have a local dev environment that mirrors the real website. Then you can make changes offline, test it before updating the online website. - It's faster because you dont have to wait for FTP to finish uploading before refreshing the page.
[08:57:36] <BadAdviceCat> Don't use PEAR, those packages are old.
[08:58:18] <BadAdviceCat> Nowadays, we use composer to download packages. You can use this website to search for the package you desire: https://packagist.org/
[09:00:48] <BadAdviceCat> Fun fact: I used Markdown to create those beautiful `readme` files that you see in the .zip that I've made.
[09:02:03] <cyanLicoriceGuy> indeed it like slavery to write a help screen in bbcode

[11:07:55] <cyanLicoriceGuy> because i am deveoping my own CMS
[11:08:08] <BadAdviceCat> cyanLicoriceGuy, you don't understand what I am trying to say. I am trying to say "Download PHP. DOwnload Composer. THEN execute composer to get `s9e/TextFormatter`. Then upload s9e/TextFormatter to your website"

[11:08:22] <BadAdviceCat> composer is a tool to download PHP libraries.
[11:09:01] <BadAdviceCat> Understand?
[11:09:58] <cyanLicoriceGuy> i could also download them manually
[11:10:06] *** Joins: nucc1 (~nucc1@user/nucc1)
[11:10:25] <BadAdviceCat> cyanLicoriceGuy, it doesn't quite work that way, because it fetches dependencies. You would also need to get the dependencies.
[11:10:30] <BadAdviceCat> compsoer does this automatically for you.
[11:10:36] <BadAdviceCat> Why do things the hard way?
[11:11:34] <cyanLicoriceGuy> because i don't want a 1000000000th beepworld page (overdriven)
[11:11:56] <cyanLicoriceGuy> they are limited
[11:12:27] <cyanLicoriceGuy> and if i want to enhance them, i need to understand foreign code
[11:12:53] <cyanLicoriceGuy> my own code is known by me
[11:13:12] <cyanLicoriceGuy> so i know where i had put it to
[11:13:31] <BadAdviceCat> cyanLicoriceGuy, the library can be enhanced without changing the original source code. This is the point of libraries.
[11:13:49] <BadAdviceCat> You can configure it and add new BBCode tags.
[11:14:52] <cyanLicoriceGuy> i started with build boxes like tripod: make your homepage in 3 steps
[11:15:20] <cyanLicoriceGuy> it was done in 15 minutes

[11:16:12] <cyanLicoriceGuy> you could change the color or font but not much more
[11:16:44] <cyanLicoriceGuy> i love that independence
[11:16:48] <BadAdviceCat> You can actually change a lot and add a lot.
[11:16:57] <cyanLicoriceGuy> or almost independence
[11:17:16] <BadAdviceCat> There is no limit to what 1 can do with s9e/TextFormatter.
[11:17:34] <BadAdviceCat> I use this for my own projects.
[11:18:16] <BadAdviceCat> This is used by projects such as https://flarum.org/  (A better alternative to phpBB by the way)
[11:19:58] <BadAdviceCat> PHPBB now also use s9e/TextFormatter.
[11:22:01] <cyanLicoriceGuy> another HTML (is insecure as we know) alternative were wikistyle
[11:22:20] <cyanLicoriceGuy> like in wikipedia editing
[11:22:48] <BadAdviceCat> Can we move the conversation to DMs?
[11:23:42] <cyanLicoriceGuy> i only few times miss a scientific editing for chemical or math formulas
[11:24:10] <cyanLicoriceGuy> maybe i could try wikimedia

[21:14:35] <FightingFalcon> Trying to access array offset on value of type null in
[21:15:31] <__adrian> that's an obvious error
[21:15:36] <__adrian> yes, fix it
[21:16:58] <FightingFalcon> How come php just dont ignore it?
[21:17:08] <FightingFalcon> if a value doesnt exist. ok, just ignore?
[21:20:39] <__adrian> because that's not ok
[21:21:13] <__adrian> it's _obviously_ an error in your code. you tried to use a variable that doesn't exist, or is not the type you expect. your code is broken. why would you _want_ to ignore that?

[21:32:27] <relipse> You should show ALL errors while in dev mode, and fix EVERYthing
[21:32:38] <relipse> and then hide errors on prod and send to log
[21:34:06] <TinoDidriksen> I always show all errors. The idea being that there naturally won't be any in production.
[21:36:20] <relipse> i don't recommend that
[21:36:32] <relipse> could be memory errors or something
[21:36:51] <relipse> I don't know , its bad ux for a user to see an error
[21:37:08] *** Joins: The_Blode_ (~Blode@user/the-blode/x-7164444)
[21:37:23] <biberu> could leak sensitive information too
[21:37:37] *** Quits: Naktibalda (~Naktibald@88.135.22.17) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[21:37:38] <relipse> right like pdo passwords
[21:38:39] <stenno> if your errors can compromise your system then you have other issues
[21:38:58] <relipse> if pdo throws an error it shows password in the connection string stenno
[21:41:02] <FightingFalcon> __adrian, ok
[21:41:22] <biberu> there's absolutely no reason to show infernal error messages to end users. log it and handle the crash gracefully
[21:41:46] <relipse> +1 for biberu
[21:42:24] <stenno> there is no reason to, but it should not be bad too
[21:42:44] <relipse> it's bad UX and it may show sensitive information and offer an attack point for a hacker
[21:42:53] * relipse walks away
[21:43:15] <FightingFalcon> if ($jack[0] != null)
[21:43:30] <FightingFalcon> instead of this: isset($jack[0]) is better?
[21:43:35] <biberu> @stenno: you don't know what third party libraries might throw, and why would you want to show e.g. stack traces to possibly malicious users?
[21:43:37] <relipse> yes FightingFalcon
[21:44:09] <relipse> or in Php 7 you can use $jack[0] ??
[21:44:14] <stenno> wat
[21:44:17] <biberu> or normal users for that matter, that looks plain unprofessional
[21:44:18] <FightingFalcon> im on php 8.1
[21:44:20] <stenno> no you can't relipse
[21:44:23] <stenno> it doesn't make sense
[21:44:28] <stenno> FightingFalcon: just use is_null
[21:44:31] <stenno> thats why its there
[21:44:40] <relipse> stenno there needs to be more code after it but ?? is nice
[21:44:48] <relipse> is_null() won't work
[21:44:51] <stenno> relipse: you haven't seen the code
[21:45:04] <stenno> ?? doesn't make sense here
[21:45:28] <relipse> exactly I haven't seen the code, just offering that ?? is possible in some situations toop
[21:45:32] <relipse> too
[21:45:46] <stenno> ...ok
[21:47:35] <stenno> still agree with TinoDidriksen though
[21:48:21] <stenno> btw i have seen 500 errors on pages like youtube
[21:48:41] *** Joins: kristijonas_ (~kristijon@88-119-92-43.static.zebra.lt)
[21:48:43] <__adrian> TinoDidriksen> I always show all errors  // always report (and log), but don't show in prod. honestly find logs easier in dev as well.
[21:48:46] <stenno> not to say that google knows best but certainly big companies don't worry some
[21:49:11] <__adrian> you'll see 500, sure
[21:49:17] <stenno> yes
[21:49:26] <__adrian> but you shouldn't see a stacks trace or any internal information.
[21:49:32] <biberu> ^
[21:49:37] <__adrian> just a nice, generic, "whups" message
[21:49:44] *** Joins: Naktibalda (~Naktibald@88.135.22.17)
[21:50:05] <stenno> oh ok
[21:50:07] *** Quits: kristijonas (~kristijon@88-119-92-43.static.zebra.lt) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[21:50:20] <stenno> yeah ok, maybe no stacktrace
[21:50:30] <stenno> well not maybe, def. not
[21:50:35] <__adrian> no details at all
[21:50:44] <__adrian> at best, they're useless to the user
[21:51:06] <stenno> 'if you see this page, report it to xyz'
[21:51:24] <biberu> therefore, what you show the end user isn't an error but an intentional result of a problem
[21:51:39] <biberu> no, log it and apologize
[21:51:43] <stenno> alright, fair
[21:51:57] <biberu> why on each do you want your users to report issues
[21:52:10] <biberu> do you not know when there's an issue?
[21:52:15] * biberu cancels payments
[21:53:02] <stenno> but its fine to see a generic 500 page
[21:53:34] <FightingFalcon> __adrian may i pm you?
[21:53:41] <biberu> yes, but that isn't an internal error, that's just a possible state for your application
[21:53:43] <__adrian> sometimes it might make sense to show a reference number, if you expect the user might want to contact your support about it
[21:53:51] <__adrian> but mainly, not really necessary
[21:53:53] <__adrian> FightingFalcon: sure

[23:24:37] <relipse> yep they are on discord
[23:25:10] <BadAdviceCat> Have fun. :)
[23:25:47] <relipse> i'm thinking of having in-game purchases
[23:27:28] <stenno> micropayments for cosmetics is a nice way to monetize an otherwise free game imo
[23:27:36] <stenno> (cosmetics only of course)
[23:30:03] <relipse> why cosmetics only
[23:30:20] <relipse> why not game play altering
[23:30:20] <stenno> because pay to win really sucks and will drive all non-whales away
[23:30:22] * BadAdviceCat will be ready to do an angry review if pay-to-win and loot boxes gets added to the game.
[23:30:25] <stenno> its just a morale thing
[23:30:29] <stenno> yes that
[23:30:37] <__adrian> to feel beautiful, of course
[23:30:46] <stenno> maybe for specifically _making money_ its a good thing
[23:30:51] <stenno> dunno even about that though
[23:30:58] <relipse> you don't have to pay to win, you can win without paying, but paying may take some annoying part of the game away
[23:31:15] <relipse> and speed things up
[23:31:29] <BadAdviceCat> And gain unfair advantage.
[23:31:38] <relipse> sigh
[23:31:45] <relipse> can't make money with anything else?
[23:32:08] <BadAdviceCat> There are successful games that didn't do that. xD
[23:32:15] <BadAdviceCat> Yes, they also made money.
[23:32:16] <relipse> if its multiplayer vs then yes it would be unfair but if its multiplayer coop or single player
[23:35:12] <stenno> you can make money simply with cosmetics
[23:35:43] <stenno> people will pay money to be able to wear a fancy hat
[23:36:06] <stenno> isn't that the business model of games like fortnite?
[23:36:49] <stenno> anyway dangerously offtopic right now, i realize
[23:45:41] <BadAdviceCat> Games has gotten so disappointing these days that I won't buy any popular console game without AngryJoe's seal of approval. xD
[23:46:08] <stenno> i finally started getting into crusader kings 3 and its amazing
[23:46:47] <Naktibalda> is it a bug of token_get_all that function call using named parameter named "class" is parsed as T_CLASS?
[23:47:09] <Naktibalda> https://3v4l.org/4ZoF7#v8.0.15
[23:48:07] <relipse> so please tell me what type of monetizing I can do if i cannot alter gameplay to help win faster?
[23:50:14] <stenno> offtopic
[23:50:20] <stenno> also i told you several times
[23:50:37] <relipse> oh crap the off-topic police are here
[23:51:06] <relipse> i found my server at 113% cpu this morning because I left a php socket on
[23:51:18] <stenno> i like how you ignored my statement about cosmetics a dozen times but then do ad hominem when i remind you of the rules
[23:51:25] <Naktibalda> shorter version: https://3v4l.org/IF5df#v8.1.2
[23:51:26] <FightingFalcon> Can you upload a file via html form but with javascript submit? i dont want <form action="submit.php"> but instead clicking the submit button will trigger a js event which will upload the form and the file
[23:51:35] <relipse> stenno: i just am not tha tgood at graphics, no one is going to pay for my cosmetics
