[05:36:11] <tpefreedom> Which major US wireless carrier is the least sleezy/most ethical?
[05:36:38] <rbraun> probably none of them
[05:37:38] <tpefreedom> Which one of them commits the fewest offences against privacy/security/human rights and/or screws over their customers?
[05:37:59] <rbraun> definitely not verizon
[05:38:26] <tpefreedom> I'll just find a budget carrier on the network of whatever big wireless carrier I dislike the least.
[05:38:33] *** Joins: trekkie1701c (~trekkie17@user/trekkie1701c)
[05:38:47] <rbraun> not a bad move
[05:39:03] <rbraun> tbh, bring your own phone is the most important thing to do with a US carrier right now if you care about privacy or freedom
[05:39:06] <rbraun> but costs more
[05:39:51] <tpefreedom> That's what I'll do because I want to be able a custom rom if I decide to do that.
[05:40:05] <DiffieHellman> Not always. Most of those tracking device/plan subscriptions end up making you pay more for the tracking device over time.
[05:40:24] <tpefreedom> Maybe a refurbished pixel. Or maybe a pinephone or pinephone pro depending on the network.
[05:40:52] <tpefreedom> phone == tracking device.
[05:41:18] <rbraun> it used to be that t-mobile was the least shitty to deal with but i'm not sure that's consistently true anymore
[05:41:47] <rbraun> verizon does quite a number of things, mostly compatibility related but also cost related, worse than the others tho
[05:41:51] <rbraun> also verizon wireless are union busters
[05:42:29] <tpefreedom> So t-mobile or at&t?
[05:42:39] <rbraun> i thought with LTE that verizon would finally start being mostly compatible but it turns out their implementation of VoLTE (which requires baseband support, not just ROM)
[05:42:48] <rbraun> is still completely nonstandard
[05:42:57] <rbraun> they actively decided not to be compatible when it was sitting right in front of them
[05:42:59] <DiffieHellman> Maybe buying a VoIP number would be the lest poor to deal with, but then your "mobile" setup will only work in Wi-Fi range, SMS support requires specific setup and also some places don't take VoIP numbers.
[05:43:18] <rbraun> you could buy a tablet SIM and put it in a phone, sometimes
[05:43:27] <rbraun> then you have LTE data and could VoIP over it
[05:43:41] <tpefreedom> I've heard that at&t actively supported prism but t-mobile didn't.
[05:43:53] <rbraun> that's quite possible
[05:43:54] <DiffieHellman> Probably the best solution, but still nonfree.
[05:44:03] <rbraun> ofc sprint is now part of t-mobile, so if they supported prism...
[05:44:12] <rbraun> 22:12 < tpefreedom> So t-mobile or at&t?
[05:44:26] <rbraun> yes, but which one and even some other ones may depend on the specifics of where you intend to use your phone
[05:46:33] <tpefreedom> I'm looking to replace my current phone. It only has 16GB of storage and also is really slow and pretty buggy. I got it at the beginning of middle school and now I'm in 11th grade. Also it doesn't receive security updates anymore.

[05:48:03] <tpefreedom> When I go to college, I tthiink I might actuaully prefer xfinity (or whatever comcast's consumer brand is called after the next rebrand) because they just spam free wifi hotspots that their subscribers can use.
[05:48:31] <rbraun> xfinity wireless is verizon mvno + their wifi hotspots

[05:49:10] <DiffieHellman> tpefreedom: Won't those require login via nonfree JavaScript? So gratis rather?
[05:49:31] <rbraun> only once
[05:49:38] <rbraun> after that it recognizes your phone's mac address
[05:50:11] <rbraun> i think you can also use a supplicant setup but i forget the details there
[05:50:48] <tpefreedom> Is there even a way to use these mobile networks and completely avoid proprietary garbage?
[05:51:06] <tpefreedom> The question to me is which ones are the least harmful.
[05:51:30] <rbraun> completely avoid? no, you have to use their baseband
[05:51:56] <DiffieHellman> tpefreedom: Not currently. Every single mobile chipset is proprietary.
[05:51:58] <rbraun> if the phone is rootable you can replace the main CPU's rom with one that is all/mostly free tho
[05:52:12] <rbraun> at least the qualcomm chipset no longer uses the baseband to boot the chain of trust on the main CPU
[05:52:16] <rbraun> like they used to
[05:52:28] <rbraun> which meant that a mobile update you can't refuse to your baseband could hack your device
[05:53:07] <rbraun> er, not just rootable but unlockable, but usually that is implied
[05:53:11] <rbraun> bootloader unlockable
[05:53:16] <DiffieHellman> The only workaround would be to get a SDR that does LTE frequencies, then to implement your own cellular modem. You then need to reverse engineer a services SIM card and extract the actual networking login steps, and then implement that.'
[05:53:32] <rbraun> pretty much
[05:54:16] <tpefreedom> sounds like too much of a pain for rn
[05:54:40] <rbraun> i think you could actually just talk to a real SIM, and only the SIM itself would be proprietary
[05:54:49] <rbraun> and there are open SIMs
[05:55:19] <DiffieHellman> Yes you can talk to the SIM, but the SIM contains a proprietary processor that's out to get you.
[05:55:29] <rbraun> ish
[05:55:34] <rbraun> it's only there to authenticate you, it can't do much else
[05:55:40] <tpefreedom> I think for now I'll just get either a pinephone or an android phone where I can flash lineage or calyx or graphene or some other degoogled rom.
[05:55:56] <rbraun> yep
[05:55:57] <tpefreedom> replicant isn't an option for me because 3G is basically dead.

[23:43:53] <M6piz7wk[m]> <Noisytoot> "What do you mean?" <- one huge monorepo with 2.2GB of pure source code designed for aviation use.. So running the editor locally just doesn't have enough of processing resources to enable work on it
[23:44:32] <M6piz7wk[m]> So i am adapting it for theia e.g. gitpod.io to work over cloud which has practically unlimited amount of processing resources for the work
