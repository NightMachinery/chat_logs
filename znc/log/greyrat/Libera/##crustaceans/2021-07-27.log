[15:13:40] <epilys> ashes in the air here as well
[15:14:04] <epilys> climate anxiety here we go
[15:39:55] <Brekkjern> Hmmz... Figuring out what courses to take the next semester is difficult :S
[15:40:31] <epilys> compsci?
[15:40:57] <Brekkjern> Yeah
[15:41:49] <Brekkjern> The problem is working full time while doing them, and the fact that I'm not registered as a full-time student, so I only get access to the courses with space in them when they have started
[15:42:19] <Brekkjern> So I need to make a list of the ones I want to take, and see which ones are available and try to sign up to them
[15:43:46] <epilys> https://www.reddit.com/r/newzealand/comments/6b88eq/good_kea_picture_by_theo_de_raadt/
[15:43:46] <buttsbot> good kea picture by Theo de Raadt : newzealand
[15:43:58] <Brekkjern> I think I have a good list of courses now, but I don't think I have the capacity to do more than 20 points per semester, and only if one of the 10 points are fairly "easy"
[15:46:24] <Brekkjern> Bleh. I need a better system for handling quick notes so I can put away things and remember where I was :S
[15:46:46] <Brekkjern> Maybe I should just make a git repo?
[15:53:32] <epilys> github gists
[15:55:38] <Brekkjern> I guess. I'd like to be able to modify them from my phone as well though
[15:58:39] <epilys> an unorthodox way of keeping notes I have is making calendar events
[15:58:52] <epilys> that way I can see when I made them and can look up the notes I have from a specific time period
[15:59:34] <Brekkjern> I'm looking for more disposable stuff. Just "I have to deal with this later, and this is how far I got"
[16:00:46] <epilys> don't overthink it cause it's procrastination
[16:00:53] <epilys> pick up a solution that works good enough
[16:02:44] <Brekkjern> Yeah. Just did.
[16:03:04] <Brekkjern> Also, why does nothing support BOM?
[16:05:30] <Brekkjern> Actually, it wasn't even BOM, but UTF-16...

[17:05:34] <Brekkjern> Well. At least I now have a list of the courses I want to take this autumn
[17:06:19] <Brekkjern> Or rather... That I want to take any autumn, but sorted somewhat by preference

[17:25:55] <gwozniak> Sore arm and a crappy sleep seem to be the only side effects of my second shot so far
[17:26:27] <goodger> \o/
[17:28:38] <gwozniak> I got it done at a pharmacy and it's clear the local health unit is more organized
[17:32:19] <Brekkjern> Congrats :)
[17:36:33] <gwozniak> thanks!
[17:36:48] <gwozniak> Didn't you get a shot too, Brekkjern?
[17:37:37] <Brekkjern> Tomorrow
[17:38:23] <Brekkjern> Unless wednesday snuck up on me and I missed it :P
[17:42:44] <gwozniak> It did not :)

[18:05:17] <goodger> :D
[18:08:11] <gwozniak> lol
[18:08:48] <gwozniak> Even if it's edited (and it probably is), it's still funny
[18:18:30] <goodger> it is
[18:19:01] <goodger> the real one had it interrupt such a track and then cut gracelessly to the middle of the national anthem
[18:19:22] <wrl> yeah
[18:19:29] <wrl> and then a more extended monologue
[18:19:44] <wrl> one of my friends had a spotify playlist called "songs that would turn prince philip to dust"
[18:20:57] <wrl> and then when he died everybody in that channel was like "HE FOUND THE PLAYLIST"
[18:22:57] <goodger> I suspect the existence of spotify itself would have given him a stroke

[21:49:53] <gwozniak> cb: I started watching the "C was already sharp" video and holy shit, it really feels like some serious historical revisionism at work
[21:50:09] <gwozniak> Gonna have to watch it all later since I have work to do, tho
[21:51:37] <cb> gwozniak: please do
[21:51:44] <cb> i would love a chisnallesque takedown
[21:52:36] <gwozniak> When it starts out saying that C has always been object-oriented and had garbage collection, it could be something special
[21:53:02] <cb> it's either going to be brilliant or shite
[21:53:04] <cb> nothing in between
[21:53:39] <gwozniak> I suspect the argument will be "it has GC because each thing should be a small process that gets its input from a pipe"
[21:53:43] <cb> let me guess, they call a sunset garbage collector real GC
[21:53:48] <cb> "exit is collect!"
[21:53:53] <gwozniak> Yup
[21:53:59] <cb> bruh
[21:58:08] <gwozniak> I'm also a little more tired than I was earlier.  Mild effects from the second dose, I think.
[22:07:44] <Church> gwozniak: Wait what
[22:07:55] <Church> Since when the fuck was C object-oriented or had a GC?
[22:08:20] <Church> Ah, reading more backlog.
[22:08:27] <Church> Still the fuck... now I gotta watch this,
[22:13:20] <gwozniak> I highly suspect it's an eloborate love letter to Unix
[22:30:32] <ngoldbaum> Church: C is a dynamically typed interpreted language
