[03:07:38] <pony> if everything is lambda, what is lambda?

[03:07:47] <pony> I haven't studied LC
[03:07:51] <ski>   Objects with their local state, the messages they pass,
[03:07:56] <ski>   A property, a package, the control point for a catch-
[03:08:03] <ski>   In the Lambda Order they are all first-class.
[03:08:09] <ski>   One Thing to name them all, One Thing to define them.
[03:08:15] <ski>   One Thing to place them in environments and bind them,

[12:08:52] <amazigh> everything is an operative :>
[12:09:07] * amazigh hides himself.
[12:09:57] <pony> :O
[12:12:48] <amazigh> more seriously, with kernel compared to scheme more things are first class like the environment or continuations (idk whether it is a good thing), and they will eliminate from user perspective the macro vs. procedure schism when there will be fast compilers or interpreters
[12:13:43] <amazigh> also the report is piece of technical art, I will use as inspiration for my future works.
[12:13:49] <amazigh> In particular the guidelines.
[12:14:02] <pony> yeah I'm going to start reading R6RS
[12:14:19] <pony> it's short :)
[12:14:22] <amazigh> what is your goal pony 
[12:14:39] <amazigh> ?
[12:14:48] <pony> I can't describe my goal yet
[12:15:09] <amazigh> :)
[12:15:21] <pony> maybe because I don't have the right language to define it :)
[12:16:00] <amazigh> the true sense of adventure is according to me doing something new without a goal
[12:16:39] <amazigh> sometime I use adventure to say "it was risky / large / difficult endeavor" but I think the correct meaning is: adventure should satisfy curiosity
[12:17:11] <amazigh> and curiosity does not have to have a goal.
