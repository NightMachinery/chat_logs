[03:25:48] <deepozon> hello friends! i'm trying to combine together a bunch of mp4 videos i took for a friend's birthday with my android.
[03:26:13] <deepozon> i run this classic command 'ffmpeg -f concat -safe 0 -i inputs.txt -c copy output.mp4'
[03:26:18] *** Quits: phonemic (~phonemic@2600:1700:3379:140::47) (Quit: WeeChat 3.2)
[03:26:20] <deepozon> where inputs.txt is a file describing the various short mp4s
[03:26:28] <deepozon> and the concatenation works perfectly but the audio is out of sync
[03:26:42] <deepozon> in the first video it's good, but when the second one starts it's delayed by many seconds
[03:26:47] <deepozon> the individual videos are all fine. i checked them with vlc.
[03:26:50] <deepozon> any idea what's wrong?
[03:26:51] <BtbN> convert each individual mp4 to mpegts first, then do the concat
[03:27:00] <deepozon> the final result needs to be in mp4 tho
[03:27:06] <BtbN> yes, so?
[03:27:09] <deepozon> ok
[03:27:13] <deepozon> so i convert to mpeg
[03:27:14] <deepozon> do the concat
[03:27:16] <deepozon> and then back to mp4?
[03:27:24] <BtbN> just do the same concat you have now
[03:27:39] <BtbN> the concat demuxer just works tremendously better with "not mp4"
[03:27:49] <deepozon> ok
[03:27:53] <deepozon> let me see
[03:27:57] <deepozon> '2. Convert:
[03:27:59] <deepozon> ffmpeg -i input.mp4 output.mpeg
[03:28:02] <deepozon> i'll do that
[03:28:04] <deepozon> and report back
[03:28:05] <deepozon> thanks
[03:28:08] <BtbN> that will do a pointless transcode
[03:28:12] <BtbN> and it's .ts, not .mpeg
[03:28:33] <deepozon> oh
[03:28:49] <deepozon> how do i do that then?
[03:28:55] <deepozon> i dont actually know the diff between transcode and convert

[03:30:34] <deepozon> first time i hear of this mysterious ts thing
[03:30:40] <deepozon> oh well no problem with that

[03:34:32] <deepozon> `ffmpeg -i second.mp4 -c copy second.mp4.ts`
[03:34:38] <deepozon> but the audio in the ts is choppy

[04:20:26] <Hello71> i'll take the bait. why?
[04:26:49] <BtbN> Padding, mostly
[04:27:20] <BtbN> an audio frame has a minimum size of samples.
[04:27:32] <BtbN> or fixed size, depending on codec
[04:27:51] <BtbN> which is fine if it's at the end
[04:27:54] <BtbN> but when concatenating...
[04:28:37] <BtbN> so if you got a particular stubborn case, you might have to transcode the audio
[04:29:31] <BtbN> But 44.1kHz AAC is fairly standard. Remux that into mpegts should not cause any damage
[04:33:54] <kepstin> yeah, the usual case is just some discontinuities at joins
[04:34:07] <kepstin> i wouldn't expect any issue except at join points
[04:34:16] *** Joins: minimal (~minimal@user/minimal)
[04:34:48] <BtbN> And I'd also expect it to cause an annoying blip at worst. Not really massive permanent desync
[04:35:19] <BtbN> Usually converting to .ts and concating that works fine. This sounds more like the files are messed up somehow
[04:44:23] <kepstin> with ts specifically, the timestamps between audio and video are still synced up within each segment, so there shouldn't be any desync, yeah

[07:55:43] <pXnEmerica> I have a metadata issue with an out of the ordinary language code. I'm under the assumption that the -metadata:s:a:X language=eng requires a ISO 639-2 code.  I have a request to add a described audio track as a secondary track, but change the language code to ENM so the external system can automate it's process.  I've tried encoding with
[07:55:43] <pXnEmerica> -metadata:s:a:1 language=enm and adding a visually_impaired disposition. FFmpeg's std output shows the (enm) and disposition during the encode, but the encoded file doesn't seem to show the enm tag. ENG works fine with the same settings.
[07:57:02] <pXnEmerica> ENM seems to techincally still be a valid code, so I'm not exactly sure where or if the tag might be getting cut, or if the parsing side's just not seeing it after an encode
[08:09:43] <pXnEmerica> Looks like I might be getting filtered by mov_mdhd_language_map

[20:54:07] <splitongop> idk if I'm not doing it right but I'm trying to use the segment to cut off a given video file right before the last GOP. Assuming segment can only start on a key frame. In theory I should be able to create a segment of totalframecount-GOP and the result should be first file with what I want. and the last segment is the last gop and whatever frames
[20:54:07] <splitongop> are left.. Instead of I get a first segment of the whole file =/

[21:25:56] <splitongop> okay cool
[21:42:35] <splitongop> It's weird because the 2nd segment has the part I want to remove.. but the first segment has the entire video file in it for whatever reason. So it is like it is overlapping segments =/

[22:04:17] <sfan5> >TIFF image data, little-endian, direntries=26, height=2893, bps=326, compression=JPEG, PhotometricIntepretation=YCbCr, manufacturer=Canon, model=LiDE 300, orientation=upper-left, width=2897
[22:04:21] <sfan5> is ffmpeg supposed to be able to read this?
[22:05:15] <sfan5> because it reads the dimensions correctly but just outputs a green image, at the very least I'd expect an error message
[22:07:07] <JEEB> tiff seems like a funky container so I'd say the answer is "depends"
[22:16:36] <splitongop> There actually might not be a problem.. These damn Panasonic files don't have DTS=PTS. My method of checking the Gop assumes that.  -___-
