[00:20:35] <M6piz7wk[m]> I have a Software specification of like 40 pages on which i've spent around 2K EUR... Is it against the spirit of FLOSS if i make that spec behind a paywall and enforced it for people to use it to write their software?
[00:21:04] <M6piz7wk[m]> or how should i adapt the economy of that?
[00:21:22] <M6piz7wk[m]> bcs i would also want people to contribute to the spec

[00:24:44] <Noisytoot> M6piz7wk[m], Eat a loss and make it FLOSS
[00:24:56] <M6piz7wk[m]> but it's 2K EUR man!
[00:25:15] <M6piz7wk[m]> and covid made me into a non-milionaire so this hurts now you know
[00:25:28] <Noisytoot> Would it's license allow distribution if you put it behind a paywall?
[00:26:21] <M6piz7wk[m]> was thinking that anyone can just pay <20 EUR to be able to redistribute it and fork 
[00:26:47] <M6piz7wk[m]> would be nice to also profit off of project that use that spec though but i don't know how to do that in technoliberal-way
[00:27:08] <Noisytoot> So it's under a free license, but you sell it?
[00:27:34] <M6piz7wk[m]> like the software that the spec is used for is designed to be FLOSS whenever possible
[00:27:53] <M6piz7wk[m]> and the spec even highlights the importance of open-soruce
[00:27:57] <M6piz7wk[m]> *source
[00:28:52] <M6piz7wk[m]> and i guess i can offset the loss in the business plan for which the FLOSS project is designed to work on, but kinda uncomfortable since i also need resources to maintain the spec which may require paying 3rd party to do research for me
[00:28:59] <Noisytoot> If it's under a free license but you just sell it, that's fine for freedom (but it still probably makes people less likely to implement your spec)
[00:29:47] <M6piz7wk[m]> like the spec is not under free license atm as it would make me to loose 2K EUR
[00:29:51] <M6piz7wk[m]> *lose 
[00:30:32] <M6piz7wk[m]> oh i could put it under FLOSS license while reserving the right to change the license in case it gets too uneconomical while requiring people to give credit and providing method for donation ðŸ¤”
[00:30:54] <M6piz7wk[m]> bcs the spec itself can get so uneconomical that it can sink the whole company x.x
[00:33:44] <Frogging101> What's the spec about? I'm just idly curious.
[00:34:17] <M6piz7wk[m]> software for aviation environment mainly 
[00:36:19] <M6piz7wk[m]> i also want to take a bite from desktop marketplace by making an OS that is very user-friendly while not limiting power-users and devs

[01:05:28] <Noisytoot> no you couldn't
[01:05:36] <Noisytoot> because FLOSS licenses can't be revoked
[01:05:44] <Noisytoot> otherwise it's not FLOSS
[01:05:57] <M6piz7wk[m]> custom license that does that then >.>
[01:06:01] <Noisytoot> You can release it under another license, but the original license is not revoked
[01:06:04] <Noisytoot> Then it isn't FLOSS
[01:06:31] <M6piz7wk[m]> LOSS that follows four freedoms as long as it's economical? Or what do you propose
[01:06:58] <Noisytoot> That's impossible
[01:07:09] <Noisytoot> If it can be revoked, it's neither free nor open-source
[01:08:18] <Noisytoot> https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html
[01:08:25] <Noisytoot> " In order for these freedoms to be real, they must be permanent and irrevocable as long as you do nothing wrong; if the developer of the software has the power to revoke the license, or retroactively add restrictions to its terms, without your doing anything wrong to give cause, the software is not free.

[01:56:51] <LiaoTao> M6piz7wk[m], So you say, and I have been giving you the benefit of the doubt
[01:56:57] <LiaoTao> Nevertheless a pattern emerges

[01:57:33] <KE0VVT> M6piz7wk[m]: GNOME is basically Red Hat.
[01:57:52] <M6piz7wk[m]> fine better example bind9 where you get non-helpful error messages and depend on paid support to get the DNS server working or spent X amount of time doing strace debugging
[01:58:16] <M6piz7wk[m]> and where the server is designed to break and confuse you so that you are forced to pay for the support 
[02:00:32] <M6piz7wk[m]> so arguably violating the freedom to use to sustain themselves 
[02:03:26] <nomagno> Selling a spec can be done under a Free Documentation license. However, theoretically only the original purchaser needs to pay, and they have the right to publish it for free after that. right to 'forking' would not be effective without the freedom to modify and redistribute anyways
[02:03:29] <M6piz7wk[m]> like the current business plan is designed to require 4K EUR every month for me to be able to sustain the project.. and it's kinda hard to do that on FLOSS and without things like selling user data for profit (which is constitutionally banned in the company)
[02:04:34] <M6piz7wk[m]> well not banned but FSF who can claim 20 seats in counsil would have to vote 15/5 for the change to pass at the current management
[02:04:38] <nomagno> 6piz7wk: You need to make 4k EUR every month, with a Free Software model, without data harvesting. Is this correct?
[02:04:56] <M6piz7wk[m]> nomagno: correct which is expected to grow over time
[02:05:05] <M6piz7wk[m]> and some of it is covered by the hardware that the project produces
[02:05:19] <M6piz7wk[m]> but currently the software side only cost me money atm.. 
[02:05:34] <M6piz7wk[m]> (not really since the company is not yet functional but projected)
[02:07:44] <M6piz7wk[m]> also i don't want to do paid support since i want everyone to be able to use the source code and even teach people who don't know the language for free
[02:08:14] <M6piz7wk[m]> and devs are projected to be paid through bug bounties
[02:08:25] <M6piz7wk[m]> s/devs/contributors/gm
[02:09:57] <nomagno> The only way I can think of making money with the moral requirements exposed is to sell the free documentation / free software along with the hardware, as an optional 'upgrade'
[02:10:29] <M6piz7wk[m]> the hardware is aviation so the documentation has to be free and publicly available so that people don't do something stupid..
[02:11:25] <M6piz7wk[m]> i was thinking about making is paywalled for commercial use since that way the other side can adjust their economy tbh
[02:13:21] <nomagno> I honestly do not think specifications being sold with "full copyright" is necessarily against the principles of the Free Software movement. If the specification contains copyrightable content that NEEDS to be used in implementations, release that as free documentation. You can make a promise not to enforce patent rights on the spec
[02:14:29] <M6piz7wk[m]> the software specification is all work on which i own copyright 
[02:15:29] <M6piz7wk[m]> and i want to avoid software patents at all cost since i don't want to be on the side that argues for legalization of software patents

[02:17:27] <nomagno> If you can include a statement vowing (! IANAL - I am not a lawyer) not to enforce patent rights and not to patent anything described in the spec, I do not think selling it under full copyright is against the FSF's principles (feel free to correct me on this)
[02:17:30] <M6piz7wk[m]> FWIW i plan on making the company governed through democratically elected representatives in the counsil who can vote and changes in business plan and constitution so the idea is giving FSF claimable seats so that even if i make it full proprietary it could be liberated 
[02:19:43] <nomagno> 6piz7wk: I can not offer much more advice. Hopefully you reach out to someone from the FSF about the last bit before trying it out though
[02:20:10] <M6piz7wk[m]> i will sent an email to FSF mailing list with proposed constitution for discussion 
[02:20:52] <M6piz7wk[m]> trying to now just figure out a +- the way to write it 
[02:22:27] <M6piz7wk[m]> Like i believe that FLOSS can be very profitable.. just building the business plan is difficult with those values 
[02:24:40] <nomagno> I realise the irony of writing this here, but offering 75% of the leveraging power on your company to an arbitrary institution like the FSF is an... interesting idea, even on paper, let alone in practice with what the cross-legislation mess.
[02:25:31] <nomagno> You can definitely make a for-profit organization with a democratic governance structure, however
[02:25:34] <M6piz7wk[m]> FSF is not qualified to govern the hardware side though 
[02:26:15] <M6piz7wk[m]> i could segregate it to subsidiaries where one focuses on software and the other on hardware and then give FSF 75% of seats though
[02:26:34] <M6piz7wk[m]> but then kinda concerned that it wouldn't be profitable
[02:27:42] <nomagno> I can not provide any advice in this regard. Wish you best of luck

[19:40:17] <White_Flame> that article does have an interesting perspective on how cell phones are actually a problem for facebook, and this is an attempt to route around them
[19:40:38] <Kaiod> Both have terrible plans for sure, Meta will collect data in an extreme way, never seen before. The idea of the Metaverse makes your life revolve around those glasses. Calls, conversations, parties, and it will take the user's power of leadership over his own life, this is not innovation, this is espionage and skilled manipulation.
