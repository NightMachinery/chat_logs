[21:38:20] <plankers> no, thats not right
[21:38:28] <plankers> the definition of narcissism is to love yourself
[21:38:39] <plankers> perhaps at the cost of loving others
[21:39:47] <arryana> that's crazy,
[21:39:55] <arryana> narcissism is a disorder.
[21:41:01] <plankers> well yes, its a disorder
[21:41:02] <plankers> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcissism
[21:41:03] <ro-bot-o> [url] Narcissism - Wikipedia | en.wikipedia.org
[21:41:20] <plankers> but a disorder characterized by excessive love of one's self, no?
[21:41:35] <arryana> no.
[21:41:45] <plankers> >Narcissism is a mental disorder and the pursuit of gratification from vanity or egotistic admiration of one's idealised self-image and attributes.
[21:41:53] <arryana> narcissists lie to everyone.  including themselves.  it's a warped self view, not a healthy one.
[21:42:02] <plankers> you mean that because youre in love with an idealized reflection, its not true self-love?
[21:42:04] <plankers> i can buy that
[21:42:19] <plankers> sorry, not you
[21:42:19] <arryana> if you've ever met one, you'll know they're scared, sad, sick people.

[22:29:42] <brigand> she has me on ignore
[22:30:05] <brigand> and i just quoted someone
[22:30:07] <plankers> im wondering how one would go about improving the self _without_ an idealized self-image
[22:30:26] <arryana> hm
[22:30:27] <plankers> something to aspire to
[22:31:08] <arryana> there's so much in life to learn it's pretty much impossible not to self-improve, if you have any interests
[22:31:41] <plankers> yes, but should those efforts not be directed?
[22:31:56] <plankers> and wouldnt they be more effective with conscious direction?
[22:32:13] <arryana> focus is always a choice
[22:32:25] <plankers> what do you mean by that
[22:32:53] <arryana> we choose what we do with every day
[22:32:59] <arryana> we all get the same 24 hours
[22:33:01] <plankers> sure
[22:33:14] <plankers> some of us get more 24 hours than others tho
[22:33:27] <arryana> i don't get what you mean by that
[22:33:35] <plankers> people dont all die at the same age lol
[22:33:58] <brigand> or have to work
[22:34:07] <brigand> mind-numbing work
[22:34:10] <plankers> yes, not working gives you MUCH more time for self-improvement
[22:34:26] <arryana> that depends what you consider self improvement
[22:34:32] <plankers> or rather, it gives you more time for more productive work
[22:34:39] <plankers> since self-improvement is a form of work
[22:35:24] <plankers> the payoffs are usually quite delayed tho, and often intangible
[22:35:38] <Autoclesis> According to some stances in virtue ethics, just a belief conversion is an improvement. Very convenient.
[22:35:47] <plankers> i would agree
[22:35:59] <plankers> i feel i improved once i abandoned liberalism for socialism
[22:36:19] <Autoclesis> I take vitamins for self-improvement.
[22:36:25] <plankers> oooh good idea
[22:36:29] <pussipupu> Autoclesis: I'm not sure numeric values work there
[22:37:32] <arryana> there's a lot of ways to improve yourself, being at work doesn't preclude all of them

[22:38:04] <Autoclesis> I was thinking that just like subjective probability estimates are sometimes quantified we could quantify the intensity of valuation in a way different than stupid economists
[22:38:19] <arryana> i wouldn't personally hang my self image solely on my interpretation of myself anyway
[22:38:37] <plankers> lots of mathy words in there to describe a value system lol

[22:40:48] <plankers> that doesnt sound useful to me lol
[22:41:04] <Autoclesis> neo-utilitarians got even fancier IIRC
[22:41:09] <plankers> ever tried comparing your suffering to somebody elses?
[22:41:16] <plankers> it just ends up making everybody upset
[22:41:20] <arryana> haha
[22:41:29] <arryana> suffering is far too subjective to work that way

[22:53:48] <arryana> i've seen scary cherry do a cover of that
[22:53:57] * blkshp steals it and adds whiskey
[22:53:58] <plankers> aerosmith has a version too
[22:54:12] <plankers> blkshp good choice. most go with vodka
[22:54:38] <blkshp> I'm not a fan unless it's the 7th Martini and i've run out of gin.
[22:54:44] <arryana> haha
[22:54:48] <plankers> of whisky or ginger beer
[22:54:53] <arryana> mmm, juniper
[22:55:05] <plankers> i came to gin rather late
[22:55:09] <blkshp> Ginger ale IS better with Whiskey (Ie Irish single malt)
[22:55:11] <Autoclesis> RIP Pete Steele :(
[22:55:25] <plankers> learned to love it after buying a $10 liter at the duty free store and sleeping drunkenly through the long-ass flight
[22:55:44] <plankers> was the last bottle left ;)
[22:55:57] <plankers> and the _only_ bottle that cost less than $30 lol
[22:56:02] <plankers> really had to search for it
[22:56:14] <plankers> beefeater gin, eat your heart out
[22:57:02] <plankers> btw if youve never tried red bull and gin, its my go-to pep up drink. i call it "forest at midnight"
[22:57:21] <arryana> oh god no
[22:57:27] <plankers> people dont believe me when i tell them it tastes awesome
[22:57:29] <plankers> their loss
[22:58:48] <arryana> i can't abide the smell of red bull, i have never tasted it and never will
[22:58:48] <Autoclesis> Utiliarianism caused more lively debates than, say, deontological ethics or even plain old consequentialism
[22:59:10] <Autoclesis> probably because of those aforementioned efforts to measure
[23:00:28] <plankers> arryana its an acquired taste, just like gin
[23:00:42] <plankers> i wouldnt lie to you, they go well together
[23:01:32] <arryana> i wouldn't touch the stuff
[23:01:52] <arryana> you might like it, but i think it reeks appallingly
[23:02:21] <arryana> if someone opens a can of that stuff in a closed car, i find it hard not to retch

[23:44:46] <PrincessPeachie> lol hi treefingers, funny name.
[23:44:50] * plankers grins
[23:44:57] <Treefingers> Hi
[23:45:19] <PrincessPeachie> Communism is tribal, like life in afghanistan. It does not take much to adhere to.
[23:45:30] <PrincessPeachie> how did you think of your name treefingers?
[23:45:32] <plankers> incorrect
[23:45:39] <zicada> uh
[23:45:49] <Treefingers> I wanted a name that wouldn't show up IRC logs if someone did a Google search
[23:45:52] <plankers> so much so that its difficult to know where to begin refuting it
[23:45:55] <plankers> a common troll tactic
[23:45:58] <zicada> PrincessPeachie: one of the main arguments against USA is that its tribal in terms of identity and not class-concious
[23:46:21] <PrincessPeachie> In fact, would anyone like a video of the trials and rules of the taliban? so that you can see the communist framework that is the basis of their system? :)
[23:46:27] <PrincessPeachie> lol
[23:46:33] <plankers> but i would begin by pointing out that there is nothing about life in afghanistan these days that approaches communism
[23:46:35] <PrincessPeachie> why wouldn't treefingers show up on irc logs?
[23:47:01] <plankers> not since the USSR pulled out
[23:47:04] <Treefingers> Because it's a Radiohead song
[23:47:09] * arryana watches the cat curl up on the dog
[23:47:15] <PrincessPeachie> I'm thinking of working for the NSA but they require no marijuana smoking for at least 12 months
[23:47:20] <PrincessPeachie> and?
[23:47:22] <plankers> good luck with that
[23:47:25] <zicada> PrincessPeachie: one of the points of class conciousness is to traverse tribal barriers like race or gender, that what they have in common is being workers and in opposition to the man, the elites, the 1%
[23:47:27] <PrincessPeachie> It might still show up on the logs O_o
[23:47:29] <I_Am_M00t> hehe, comparing Afghanistan to communism
[23:47:39] <Treefingers> So the song will show up higher in the search results than IRC logs
[23:47:43] <PrincessPeachie> I wasn't comparing Afghanistan to communism
[23:47:50] <plankers> you did
[23:47:53] <zicada> PrincessPeachie: you were
[23:47:57] <plankers> <PrincessPeachie> Communism is tribal, like life in afghanistan. It does not take much to adhere to.
[23:47:59] <Treefingers> More people will link to and visit pages related to the Radiohead song
[23:48:00] <PrincessPeachie> I was stating that the political system in Afghanistan is indeed communist
[23:48:01] <PrincessPeachie> :)
[23:48:09] <plankers> well youd be wrong there
[23:48:10] <zicada> PrincessPeachie: maybe you didnt mean to, but what you typed did compare them
[23:48:14] <plankers> laughably so, as i said
[23:48:17] <I_Am_M00t> :)
[23:48:24] <PrincessPeachie> Why don't you want to appear in IRC logs? lol
[23:48:24] <arryana> it's just more trollbait
[23:48:32] <plankers> im aware arryana
[23:48:32] <PrincessPeachie> That's clever but both will still appear.
[23:48:40] <plankers> i have experience dealing with their type
[23:48:52] <Treefingers> I bet the Radiohead song will show up on all of page 1
[23:49:02] <PrincessPeachie> Do you like radiohead?
[23:49:08] <plankers> radiohead is great
[23:49:15] <arryana> send the karma police
[23:49:22] <PrincessPeachie> lol there is a beowulf here. I loved the film. The poem is pretty good too.
[23:49:22] * plankers puts on hail to the thief
[23:49:27] <Treefingers> Radiohead is good but actually the Treefingers track is a bit boring
[23:49:36] <plankers> a fine socialist album
[23:49:39] <PrincessPeachie> I've never heard the treefingers track.
[23:49:47] <PrincessPeachie> are you from the uk?
[23:49:50] <Treefingers> Yes
[23:50:00] <PrincessPeachie> Oh that's nice. How's it going there?
[23:50:05] <Treefingers> It's alright
[23:50:12] <Treefingers> Rain as unpredictable as usual
[23:50:20] <PrincessPeachie> I wonder if I can still work for the NSA if I fill in yes for having taken marijuana in the last 12 months
[23:50:28] <plankers> lmao
[23:50:34] <PrincessPeachie> Is everyone going crazy over at the UK like they are in the US?
[23:50:48] <arryana> i'm still fascinated by the idea that anyone can believe a person can only have two or three friends
[23:51:01] <plankers> arryana ive met people like that
[23:51:07] <plankers> the internet does scary things to some people
[23:51:09] <arryana> wow.
[23:51:17] <Treefingers> Going crazy over what?
[23:51:28] <arryana> i mean, there's a limit to how many peanut butter pass friends a person can have
[23:51:32] <arryana> just because of time constraints
[23:51:44] <PrincessPeachie> Everything
[23:51:44] <plankers> the type of person you describe doesnt leave their house if they can help it
[23:51:47] <PrincessPeachie> covid19
[23:51:52] <PrincessPeachie> race
[23:51:58] <PrincessPeachie> capitalism
[23:52:01] <PrincessPeachie> employment
[23:52:07] <PrincessPeachie> celebrities
[23:52:07] <arryana> the last really big party i attended, we had 200 people.  and we knew all of them.
[23:52:22] <PrincessPeachie> relationships

[23:54:43] <kmh> today's random tv quote: "It is well known that the Nixon is the Rolls Royce of the presidential shaped potato ships"
[23:55:10] <plankers> audrey troll being a troll
[23:55:31] <plankers> theyve been pacified for the moment
