[08:37:41] <omero> ah ... lol
[08:38:51] <omero> should be 19, Smeef 
[08:39:03] <Smeef> Thanks!
[08:39:36] <omero> ;)
[08:39:37] <emmeka> confusing.
[08:40:20] <omero> argh
[08:40:32] <omero> sorry smeef, that is keycode for equal
[08:40:36] <emmeka> why would # be 19, if = is 13, assuming you're talking about US ANSI.
[08:40:48] <emmeka> shouldn't it just be 5
[08:40:49] <Smeef> I just mounted a BME688 Temperature, Humidity, Pressure and Gas Sensor to my Pocket Deck RPi project, and I built a custom board to emulate keypresses that aren't on the regular keyboard
[08:40:52] <omero> yeah rigght emmeka :)
[08:41:14] <Smeef> Crap, thanks
[08:41:21] <Smeef> 5 is #
[08:41:28] <Smeef> Confirming...
[08:41:43] <emmeka> = is the 13th key on the top row in ISO/ANSI, so
[08:41:53] <omero> according to xev, # is 49
[08:42:21] <Smeef> Argh, having multiple dtoverlays is causing my display driver to fail

[08:47:03] <Smeef> FML
[08:47:55] <tcsilver> pizza
[08:47:59] <tcsilver> is leg
[08:48:42] <emmeka> Smeef nvm, it should be 4, apparently I can't count. Or like, the 3 key should be 4?
[08:49:16] <Smeef> keycode 5 is a 4 key press
[08:49:43] <emmeka> yes. it's 4 is the 5th key on the top row, which makes sense. I just couldn't count.
[08:51:30] <Smeef> Ah, if that's how it works, then how do I count to #?
[08:52:24] <emmeka> Smeef well I just checked xev and for me shift+3, ie #, is 12
[08:52:48] <Smeef> Hmm, thanks, I'll try ti out
[08:53:18] <emmeka> why, don't ask me. I thought these things worked by treating it like the key and the modifier key were two separate things
[08:54:31] <emmeka> I've been dabbling with keyboard stuff a bit messing with custom layouts and looking into building a custom one
[08:54:33] <Smeef> 12 is -
[08:54:35] <Smeef> 8(
[08:54:47] <emmeka> but... what?
[08:55:16] <Smeef> IDK, I'm not even building a full kb, just jumping GPIO pins to ground to get like 5 additional keys
[08:58:28] <emmeka> you're right, logically 12 should be -, but when I run xev and do shift+3 it gives me: state 0x11, keycode 12 (keysym 0x23, numbersign)
[08:58:47] *** Quits: RenAdjest (~RenAdjest@user/renadjest) (Quit: Leaving)
[09:00:41] <emmeka> oh. I was right the first time.
[09:01:54] <emmeka> 3 and # are both keycode 12. but you probably don't even want keycodes, I think, if that's what you're doing?
[09:02:45] <omero> under X, it depends on the chosen layout of the keyboard
[09:03:05] <emmeka> oh. well that makes sense. I type with a sort of unusual layout.
[09:03:41] <omero> emmeka: same here
[09:04:47] <emmeka> Smeef so you're actually modifying the keyboard itself, right, to add additional keys? I'm not sure this is going to work. 
[09:06:01] <Smeef> emmeka, nope, not modifying the keyboard, I'm on a Raspberry Pi, it has a keyboard connected but the keyboard is missing some keys, so I'm trying to use the GPIO pins on the Pi to register as the missing keys
[09:06:14] <omero> he's probably wanting that a certain key on "his" keyboard be emitting a certain key
[09:07:03] <Smeef> Here's a pic, the five buttons on the top right are the buttons I'm trying to get working using a program called pikeyd: https://i.imgur.com/urG4EkQ.jpg

[09:09:31] <omero> cute :)
[09:09:37] <emmeka> Smeef like I'm a pleb at these things and all, but uhhhh my understanding is keyboards send scancodes specified by the USB standard, then the kernel gets these and is like "ok, this scancode = this keycode, according to what I know" and then Xorg or whatever checks layout maps and is like "this keycode plus this keycode from a modifier key = this symbol"
[09:10:14] <omero> emmeka: yes... 
[09:10:40] <omero> how to grab the scancode is hairy matter
[09:10:47] <emmeka> and so 1) there is no keycode for #, 3 and # have the same keycode 2) the keycode will be different depending on your system anyway
[09:11:45] <omero> well... 3 and # have the same, with # being modified by shift
[09:12:05] <omero> at least on a US keyboard
[09:12:27] <emmeka> right. but you can't really tell that from keycodes, right? all the keycodes would know is that both 3 and either left or right shift are pressed.

[09:13:20] <emmeka> omero because there could be even higher levels to this, for example for me shift+altgr+3 is a macron deadkey
[09:13:30] <omero> correct
[09:13:43] <omero> thats what modifiers do actually

[09:14:00] <ButterNoodle> jessedesu2: found my next bike
[09:14:11] <emmeka> the keycodes don't know if I'm typing 3 or # or a macron deadkey, they just throw all those keycodes at Xorg and let it figure it out

[09:15:26] <jessedesu2> You are balls deep into the superbikes
[09:15:27] <ButterNoodle> I mean I was gonna get the rsv4 factory..
[09:15:32] <emmeka> Urchin[emacs] I couldn't use any non-QWERTY layout just because it'd nuke my ability to use QWERTY elsewhere, and other people's ability to use my PC (namely, my wife)
[09:15:38] <ButterNoodle> I miss it
[09:16:02] <jessedesu2> I havent rode the f4i in 7 weeks
[09:16:23] <emmeka> besides, all the alt layouts are only useful if you type only in English
[09:16:35] <Smeef> Well this sucks
[09:16:39] <ButterNoodle> I should just get a  new one...
[09:16:52] <Smeef> How the heck am I supposed to get a # from GPIO
[09:16:54] <jessedesu2> A new what
[09:16:57] <omero> I type often foreign languages (i.e: italian, french, german)

[09:18:00] <jessedesu2> Is there a good brand you reccomend
[09:18:01] <ButterNoodle> I'll have an extra 1100 in folding money come january
[09:18:14] <ButterNoodle> I have no idea jessedesu2.. I build or buy nuc's 
[09:18:21] <ButterNoodle> and nucs are expensive
[09:18:34] <jessedesu2> Get a gaming nuc?
[09:18:34] <emmeka> Smeef well, I think you could probably figure out by trial and error what key is 3 for you, and if you can have it do 2 keycodes (either one of the shifts, and then the 3 key) it should maybe work?
[09:18:41] <jessedesu2> I want windows11
[09:18:45] <jessedesu2> With wsl
[09:18:46] <ButterNoodle> I still havent ruled out a fireblade

[09:18:56] <Smeef> Thanks emmeka 
[09:19:04] <jessedesu2> Honda is boring
[09:19:10] <emmeka> Smeef but have you considered just doing a keyboard layout on the existing keyboard instead
[09:19:11] <jessedesu2> Too perfect
[09:19:14] <ButterNoodle> meh
[09:19:17] <Urchin[emacs]> emmeka: I don't type only in English, but I overwhelmingly type in English, to the point that QWERTY was becoming outright painful to use, and this actually has pretty decent support for other languages using latin script: https://colemak.com/Multilingual#French_.28Fran.C3.A7ais.29

[09:19:50] <ButterNoodle> fuck no
[09:19:52] <Smeef> emmeka, I don't think the existing keyboard can be messed with
[09:20:02] <ButterNoodle> like a 2019 or newer blade
[09:20:03] <emmeka> yeah it can
[09:20:04] <jessedesu2> When I think fireblades I think 954s from the 90s
[09:20:12] <ButterNoodle> that would be 2000
[09:20:13] <emmeka> Smeef or, the layout can
[09:20:22] <ButterNoodle> the 900rr ran till 99 iirc
[09:20:38] <jessedesu2> I always run into a fireblade dude too or from work

[09:21:24] <ButterNoodle> gsxr was the better bike
[09:21:24] <jessedesu2> Now that I have a 675 I can keep up sort
[09:21:45] <omero> as in you seem to have # over E

[12:27:50] <DunceCotus> just be aware that to provide a good free service on a site like this, you need to extract surplus value somehow

[15:41:51] <darkwitch> how many hundred methods can you use to pay with at 7-eleven?
[15:42:38] <darkwitch> elsewhere there can be very few. in japan they are still experimenting with such things
[15:43:02] <zoidberg> Japanese are also changing their monetary system as there is also risk of typhoons and floods
[15:43:22] <zoidberg> at least that's what I heard from Chris, the youtuber

[16:18:49] <MootPoot> ?
[16:19:19] <amigojapan> Yes MootPoot 36 years from now
[16:19:21] <JesseDesu> !c 2021 - 80

[16:24:42] <Bco1981> it has to be just right. Too high, you won't make it. Too low, your won't make it.

[16:24:56] <MootPoot> amigojapan: no, I don't think so amigo 
[16:25:06] <MootPoot> What's the point of that? 
[16:25:35] <amigojapan> MootPoot: faster than radio signals
[16:25:49] <Bco1981> the fiber isn't limited to speed, yet. the optical lasers are
[16:25:49] <MootPoot> Yes but what's wrong with copper 
[16:26:06] <MootPoot> Usb 3.0 on modern smartphones already caps at 5gbit 
[16:26:22] <MootPoot> And you can't charge through a optical fiber so you'd need 2 wires 
[16:26:31] <MootPoot> Why not just stick with copper 
[16:26:45] <Bco1981> you can multiplex wavelenghts on 1 fiber, and get insane transfer speeds
[16:27:10] <amigojapan> MootPoot: mix copper for power and fiber for data
[16:27:22] <MootPoot> Why not just use copper for both? 
[16:27:34] <MootPoot> Thunderbolt can do 40gbit over copper 
[16:27:51] <Bco1981> that's limited
[16:28:00] <JesseDesu> copper field

[16:28:07] <Bco1981> but, for local transfer is fine
[16:28:13] <MootPoot> ^ 
[16:28:22] <MootPoot> It is a local transfer scenario 
[16:28:45] <MootPoot> Having wires of two different types in a cable is a recipie for disaster

[16:28:54] <MootPoot> One can bend more then the other

[20:29:08] <MootPoot> electric or hand
[20:29:26] <TsundereNoises> I mean the one you were looking at is pretty decent in that price range, but I can look around a bit later
[20:29:35] <TsundereNoises> it's not BAD, I just wanted to point out the downsides of it
[20:29:45] <S_T_A_N> If $50 is the hard limit either option is fine, just a matter of if you want to do it by hand or not
[20:30:06] <TsundereNoises> I mean, electric is much easier on your arm muscles, but you probably have pretty strong wrists MootPoot
[20:30:11] <MootPoot> lol
[20:30:28] <MootPoot> If its a manual one I'll hook up my electric drill to it
[20:30:34] <MootPoot> I just want best grind
[20:30:37] <MootPoot> for that price
[20:30:42] <S_T_A_N> Then get the manual one
[20:30:50] <MootPoot> which manual one
[20:30:52] *** Parts: bhava (~bhava@node-1w7jr9ssziz5em47lsdp9imif.ipv6.telus.net) ()
[20:31:11] <TsundereNoises> I haven't tried that, but my gut says it won't be as good a grind with a drill, I feel like slow and steady helps the grind on these cheaper ones, but that might be irrational bs, I'm not actually sure
[20:31:49] *** Joins: vxlen_[m] (~vxlenmatr@2001:470:69fc:105::1:2d2b)
[20:31:58] <TsundereNoises> yeah I think for the money manual tend to be better just because you're not paying for a motor as part of the cost, they're a much simpler device

[20:32:05] <TsundereNoises> so at the same price, more of the cost is in the burrs
[20:32:28] <S_T_A_N> You get a better burr but no motor

[20:36:13] <Berlin36> hello emmeka 
[20:36:23] <Berlin36> lmao that quote
[20:36:37] <Berlin36> it's funny cuz it's true
[20:36:44] <TsundereNoises> MootPoot: the Hario isn't terrible or anything though
[20:37:11] <S_T_A_N> TsundereNoises, that's a stainless bur rather than a ceramic 
[20:37:19] <TsundereNoises> yes
[20:37:24] <S_T_A_N> Okay
[20:37:28] <TsundereNoises> but at the price range I think that'd be my pick
[20:37:37] <TsundereNoises> it's $9 more than MootPoot wanted
[20:37:45] <TsundereNoises> I've used the Hario, I'm not a big fan
[20:37:48] <S_T_A_N> The one MootPoot linked was ceramic though
[20:37:48] <TsundereNoises> but like, it's not awful
[20:38:07] <TsundereNoises> yeah, it's ceramic but that's not everything
[20:38:30] <TsundereNoises> it's kind of a pain in the ass physically
[20:38:58] <TsundereNoises> and the grind, at least on the couple years older model I used, is less consistent than you'd think
[20:39:07] <TsundereNoises> although it's a hell of a lot better than the one he's using now
[20:39:10] <S_T_A_N> Fair enough
[20:39:25] <S_T_A_N> You've actually used it so that hold more weight than anything I can say
[20:39:28] <TsundereNoises> like any of these are absolutely a step up
[20:39:48] <TsundereNoises> S_T_A_N: yeah it was my first coffee grinder
[20:40:11] <emmeka> I use a bodum, strainless steel burr, but the thing has lasted for at least 5 years now and is still very consistent
[20:40:44] <TsundereNoises> actually as much as it's kind of dumb, a nice feature of those Hario ones is the bottom is the same size as a standard mason jar, so if you wanted to grind a lot of coffee into a jar, you can do it easily
