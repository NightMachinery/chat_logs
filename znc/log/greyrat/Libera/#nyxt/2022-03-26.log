[15:53:39] <fnstudio> hey :), i'm moving my first steps with nyxt, for some reason i notice that i tend to find myself in certificate-exception mode - which is something i wouldn't want as a matter of fact
[15:54:05] <fnstudio> i may be triggering that accidentally with some muscle-memory shortcut
[15:55:10] <fnstudio> can someone point me to some docs on how to disable this permanently - or rather how to unbind it so that it becomes more difficult for me to enable it accidentally?
[15:55:37] <fnstudio> well i guess i can start by having a look at the manual...
[15:55:42] <fnstudio> hold on
[15:59:10] <fnstudio> hm weird, if i invoke `describe-bindings' (i.e. `F1 b') i don't seem to see any binding associated to certificate exception
[16:16:28] <fnstudio> ok, i seem to have fixed it by adding a "define-configuration" setting as indicated here https://nyxt.atlas.engineer/article/common-settings.org
[16:16:57] <fnstudio> (but removing the exception mode of course, as opposed to what indicated at the link above)
[16:36:01] <aartaka> fnstudio: certificate-exception-mode is a helper mode to allow you allowlisting certificates. It's enabled by default, and it should cause no harm leaving it be :)
[16:39:24] <fnstudio> aartaka: oh i see... sorry, i was completely misunderstanding it then
[16:40:00] <fnstudio> i thought it'd allow a relaxed approach to http (or wrongly configured https) urls
[16:41:50] <aartaka> fnstudio: enforsing HTTPS is what force-https-mode does :)
[16:42:26] <aartaka> But it should also be fine as a default, as it handles http websites reasonably well too.
[16:46:02] <fnstudio> aartaka: amazing, thanks (do you think i need to explicitly configure force-https-mode in my init.lisp or should it be on by default?)
[16:48:37] <aartaka> fnstudio: (I don't remember.)

[20:56:22] <DustyQuince> Hi. I looked everywhere I could think of, but wasn't able to find the answer. Apologies if this is answered somewhere else, but I was just wondering if the Nyxt browser supports WebAssembly or if there were any official plans to do so?
