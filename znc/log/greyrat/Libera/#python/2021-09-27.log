[00:00:28] <braxas> teut: on_message triggers for every message, what it is is saying is, that messages you send, are also messages, and will thus also trigger on_message
[00:00:36] <braxas> I actually don't quite get what about this is surprising
[00:01:04] <teut> sorry, it was telegram which was made by microsoft
[00:01:10] <braxas> It may be sometime people overlook when writing their logic, but I don't see why it is surprising that all messages trigger on_message, or that messages your bot sends is also included in the set of all messages
[00:01:18] <braxas> teut: also not factual
[00:01:37] <braxas> microsoft did not make telegram

[03:24:41] <dre> people want to see how you got to the answer, not just the answer :D
[03:24:42] <stewie925> so we should never use result.sort() in a return statement then
[03:24:56] <dre> just know what they do
[03:24:59] <stewie925> hi dre, yeah duly noted :)
[03:25:15] <jeho> you shouldn't do result.sort() in a return statement anyway because it doesn't return anything
[03:25:50] <stewie925> jeho, how is that?

[03:28:03] <stewie925> can I just do pseudocode just to show them my train of thought (if I could not finish on time)
[03:28:21] <jeho> my suggestion would be to shoot for the naive approach to solving rather than getting hung up in how to find the optimal solution if it's not immediately obvious to you how to get it

[03:46:19] <nedbat> stewie925: hardly a guru, just someone that thinks it can be explained without a lot of math
[03:46:52] <jeho> in real world practical programming that's true.. but these coding challenges can be a bit unreal

[04:06:14] <stewie925> yeah, I tried the brute approach first, its not looking good
[04:06:22] <jeho> did you get it working?
[04:06:28] <stewie925> Given an integer array nums, return all the triplets [nums[i], nums[j], nums[k]] such that i != j, i != k, and j != k, and nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] == 0.

[04:07:03] <stewie925> so I just basically had three loops, I, j, and k... oh I guess I see where I did wrong
[04:07:28] <jeho> the nested loops would attempt all combinations
[04:07:30] <stewie925> the I should start with index 0, j start with index 1, and k start with index 2 I believe
[04:07:50] <jeho> yeah.. that can reduce the number of operations a little bit

[04:09:57] <stewie925> for this array [-1,0,1,2,-1,-4],  the expected answers are [-1,0,1] and [-1,-1,2] but my result is [-1,0,-1] ugh

[05:15:28] <jeho> agreed
[05:15:29] <stewie925> honestly,  3 out of 5
[05:15:45] <stewie925> mine is going to be hackerrank
[05:15:52] <Widdershins> if the only thing they do to assess how good you are at making software is give you brainteasers the company is probably not hiring good people
[05:15:52] <stewie925> I was told in advance
[05:15:58] <Widdershins> that's too bad
[05:16:03] <jeho> they aren't a true test of a developer's ability, and frankly they're kind of rude to be honest and dehumanizing
[05:16:21] <Widdershins> unfortunately that's also not a terrible sign because everyone does this
[05:16:35] <Widdershins> software interviews are 99% cargo cult
[05:16:45] <CodePoint> those tests are stupid.
[05:16:52] <stewie925> I read from Quora that some interviewers accept pseudocode -  I dunno
[05:16:59] <CodePoint> if you can pass one you should just start your own business instead
[05:17:09] <stewie925> like, they want to get your thought process
[05:17:45] <jeho> If I were in charge of hiring with a company that used these for screening.. I would pick easy ones, and then I'd have someone see if they could solve them to make sure they were realistic to give to candidates for screening
[05:18:10] <Widdershins> a lot of questions are pseudocodeable. that's what a whiteboard interview is in the first place originally, there's no runtime
[05:18:14] * SnoopJ greatly prefers to evaluate process, not product
[05:18:30] <Widdershins> actually live coding can show how familiar the person is with debugging, in a hostile and unfamiliar environment
[05:18:34] <jeho> yeah.. unfortunately with these automated tests, you can't pseudocode your way through it or get a partial solution

[05:21:23] <Widdershins> unfortunately you can't screen them by this because basically every company does this anyway

[05:36:30] <Widdershins> that's one of those things that really shouldn't be offered in a coding interview like that. if it is just write the stupidest brute force that still eventually produces a result in theory

[05:42:39] <SnoopJ> Widdershins, I don't think I do, actually
[05:43:21] <Widdershins> you just keep a running nonnegative sum and a maximum that number reaches and it's linear time O(1) space
[05:43:30] <Widdershins> anyway i was asked an extension of this and thought it was for generalized subsets of a grid or graph (turns out he just wanted it for rectangles) but he was interested in seeing my approach to it
[05:43:48] <Widdershins> i thought about it a lot and couldn't make a lot of headway and looked it up later and it's NP-complete

[05:44:32] <grym> if i keep clicking links i'm going to wind up browsing OEIS all night, aren't i
[05:44:36] <Widdershins> like you're basically asking for some kind of optimal slime mold feeding network style solution to net-positive n-way bridges between positive islands in an arbitrary graph, turns out that's expensive
[05:45:02] <SnoopJ> Widdershins, hot take: simplex optimization works in more places than it's given credit for
[05:45:20] <jeho> when you're stressing and self conscious about your performance solving a problem that could mean employment with the company you want.. the wording of these problems makes them seem crazy hard for the first few minutes just trying to read them and get what they want you to do

[18:13:35] <littlepython> does it check if a key is present in the dictionary?
[18:13:37] <rendar> bjs, because the managing function sets something into the task, e.g. task._tg_result = MyData()
[18:13:44] <bjs> littlepython: no, it's nothing to do with dictionaries

[21:18:51] <stewie925> oh because it is expecting just one integer instead of three?
[21:18:52] <SnoopJ> It doesn't look like a bug, probably some other feature in the IDE getting in the way, or maybe that package is already installed in the environment (is it used in any of the assignments for previous weeks, perhaps?)
[21:18:55] <stealth_> stewie925, you are mixing int/str on line: 4 and 6
[21:20:03] <stealth_> stewie925, not sure why you are using % formating! you can just print it as is

[22:16:58] <MTecknology> I'm trying to write a "helper library" for $work to deal with some script cleanup. This move to a unified set of libraries is pulling in a few languages so I'm trying to find the most sensible way to keep it easily distributed and easy to import/use.    I know I /could/ keep it in it's current form (in a repo as helpers/py3utils.py) and then use sys.path.append('path/to/helpers');
[22:17:04] <MTecknology> import py3utils, but I suspect that's not terribly sane for reasons I'm currently unaware of.  Any chance I could get some advice on this? (better methods, problems with this, search terms)

[22:27:18] <MTecknology> This is more of an attempt to clean up a general distributed clusterfuck by taking a bunch of commonly repeated functions/actions and shoving them into a single location that I can wrap in a butt load of unit testing. I'm hoping that I can actually keep it generic enough to work with py2 as well, but ehm... whatever if I can't.

[23:52:56] <bjs> neilthereildeil: if you're in a venv it probably means you created a python3 venv, so you might want to delete it and re-make it with python2
[23:52:58] <Yhg1s> neilthereildeil: you would need to create it with Python 2.
[23:53:03] <neilthereildeil> how?
[23:53:13] <Yhg1s> neilthereildeil: the same way as you created it with Python 3, but with Python 2 instead.
[23:53:21] <bjs> neilthereildeil: delete it then e.g. `python2 -m venv` rather than `python3 -m venv`
