[00:45:59] <trbp> just only 58?
[00:46:13] <kmh_> so you can expect more than a few contemporary German speaking philosophers
[00:46:53] <trbp> oh wait you wrote university and not hochschule or ghs or such hm yeah ;)
[00:47:27] <kmh_> audrey,  i assume it is similar to local tv station which is largely controlled by single corporate group as well
[00:47:32] <trbp> then again i guess there are not  hochschules anymore all renamed kinda university even most fhs i guess are doing so more and more
[00:48:49] <kmh_> audrey, and i actually would argue those eveer increasing media corporations and conglomerates are becoming a threat to press freedom as much as censorship by the state
[00:50:18] <kmh_> in fact in current stransformations censorship by the state often starts silently/slowly by all larger outlets getting controlled/bought up by government friendly corporations/oligarchs
[00:52:17] <kmh_> trbp,  that included all types of universities teaching philosophy, but the figure is lower estimate taken from student information portal

[03:52:54] <Samian> I read news that implies stats of percentages of women in profession or that reflects the desires of society and not the desires of the individual people.
[03:53:20] <Samian> Like, if 80% of ceos are women, that's because women are blocked by some discriminatory force
[03:53:30] <Samian> rather than most women just don't desire to be a ceo
[03:54:24] * Samian shakes his head at the stupidity in most news pieces
