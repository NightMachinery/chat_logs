[12:58:36] <Altreus> this comic brings back too many memories of "I got back and my tmux was dead and only one of my shells got to keep its history and it wasn't the one with the command I spent ages constructing"
[12:59:31] <BinGOs> wc -l ~/.bash_history
[12:59:34] <BinGOs> 19950
[12:59:39] <BinGOs> ouch
[13:00:07] <gerikson> I limit mine to 2000
[13:00:10] <gerikson> keeps me on my toes
[13:00:17] <Altreus> hey
[13:00:27] <Altreus> I just realised I had a dream in which I had to write down the name of a song
[13:00:33] <Altreus> On pain of something terrible
[13:00:41] <Altreus> And I wrote down No Limits by 2 Unlimited
[13:00:51] <Altreus> But then I got scared that maybe it was called No Limit and I was gonna die as a result
[13:00:59] <BinGOs> Na na na na na
[13:01:22] <BinGOs> thanks for the ear worm, YOU MONSTER!

[13:58:25] <Altreus> What's a word that covers the concept of "this will actually try to do something that may be permanent" as opposed to "this is designed to be safe for a test environment and won't do anything external"?
[13:58:49] <Altreus> I wanna say "this implements live APIs" but... it needn't, it just uses URLs instead of being self-contained
[14:00:29] <Altreus> I'll just put this one sends data to URLs

[14:33:54] <LeoNerd> Does anyone understand google sheets?
[14:34:21] <LeoNerd> I wrote yesterday's date in a cell as 2021/06/21 and it has preserved it that way exactly. I try to write today's and it trims the leading 0 to become 2021/6/22
[14:34:29] <LeoNerd> just... what??!

[14:36:32] <huf> that's a weird fucking date format 
[14:37:23] <LeoNerd> YYYY/MM/DD
[14:37:44] <LeoNerd> I suppose I could try hyphens instead
[14:41:30] <huf> well yes
[14:41:45] <huf> but who knows, even that might not be enough
[14:42:10] <huf> weird that god never mentions excel shit in the bible when he's cursing mankind and exiling them from eden
[14:42:49] <Botje-> LeoNerd: are you sure that's not june 2021th 2022? :D

[14:44:21] <choroba> he mentioned it but the record keepers didn't understand the concept 2000 years ago
[14:44:51] <jabberwok> Well, the Council of Nicea accepted Numbers, but omitted Alphas and Diacritics. Wingdings were considered heresy and burned.
