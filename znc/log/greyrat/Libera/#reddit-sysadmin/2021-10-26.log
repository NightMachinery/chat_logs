[05:15:14] <xe0n> you're winging something pretty important lol, if backup fails you're going to float down the creek lol
[05:16:27] <Work-BWMerlin> Basically, how many SQL installs should I have and what warrants a separate install?
[05:16:31] <sd> 06<N​injaStyle> True they probably have best practices docs on that

[05:16:55] <csws> pffffffffffffffffffffft backups
[05:17:38] <csws> Work-BWMerlin, how super mega big is your environment? I think veeam supports localdb and even defaults to it
[05:17:59] <mistiry> it would depend on how big and busy the db's would be and what the VM specs are
[05:18:07] <mistiry> i'd def. ask veeam for best practices
[05:18:10] <sd> 15<L​oudergood> I don't feel like you should have your backup system and actual data on the same resources
[05:18:16] <mistiry> most likely, separated
[05:18:19] <Work-BWMerlin> Our environment is small enough that community edition works

[05:18:35] <xe0n> have you got a separate host to install it on?
[05:18:40] <Work-BWMerlin> Though I am thinking of upgrading (once testing is over) so I get the ability to backup to sharepoint
[05:18:41] <xe0n> your backup infra should be separate to your other stuff
[05:18:44] <xe0n> and also storage...
[05:18:52] <csws> "When protecting more than 500 VMs. The max database size allowed by Express Edition is usually sufficient, so do not consider this a constraint. Veeam Backup & Replication console and job processing may however slow down as a result of CPU and RAM constraints on the SQL Server Express instance."
[05:18:56] <mistiry> RAID is best backup 
[05:19:00] <mistiry> so make sure you are using that
[05:19:12] <xe0n> i would stop if you plan to backup sharepoint, get the funds and approval now

[07:50:46] <sd> 15<S​ora> The idea of the 9 layers of hell come from a book called the divine comedy written out into three parts. Dantes inferno is the part that talks about it.

[07:54:10] <spiderman> you know you blame god all you want, but its satans fault for making hell so awful

[07:55:24] <spiderman> well hes just one deity. you can't expect him to be omniscient AND omnipotent

[08:41:37] <SirSceptalot> surprised I didn't see more people with MK facemasks running around the last few years actually
[08:41:48] <SirSceptalot> lol, I really enjoyed the first movie
[08:41:57] <SirSceptalot> I mean... it's not top notch cinema
[08:42:00] <spiderman> sub-zero in mk11 is a bullshit character, he has a near-instant slide attack that hits from 3/4 of the whole screen
[08:42:12] <SirSceptalot> but it entertained me, so that was always well enough for me
[08:42:42] <spiderman> I liked it. Its just got cheesy dialogue and the character development is, well, predictable. 
[08:43:04] <spiderman> kano ends up being a dick and sub-zero is still a bad guy

[11:58:42] <Lancehead> See, that's what they *want* you to think 
[11:59:03] <Activ8> laptops usually only have 2 slots
[11:59:18] <Lancehead> This one does as well. It has 4GB soldered to the motherboard +2 slots 
[11:59:23] <SirSceptalot> on a sidenote, I kinda love the HP logo, the one made of stripes

[12:01:42] <Lancehead> Don't treat them as suck 
[12:01:53] <Lancehead> Yeah it's weird as hell 
[12:01:55] <csws> t480s was 8 soldered I think
[12:02:00] <csws> and now t490s it's all soldered
[12:02:05] <Activ8> csws probably 4gb on board as its minimum requirement to run maybe
[12:02:22] <Activ8> not sure if you need ram in slots for it to work or if it works just on the 4gb soldered
[12:02:25] <Lancehead> Ooooof. t490s have no slots to expand? 
[12:02:30] <csws> Activ8, it's because the base model is 4 so if you ask for extra they shove in a SODIMM
[12:02:38] <Activ8> cool
[12:02:48] <Lancehead> Mine works on the 4gb soldered. I know this because I accidentally didn't plug in my other 16 properly and it booted on 4 
[12:02:53] <csws> Lancehead, yeah like 99% sure. I checked it out before leaving the last joint and held onto the P52 tightly after seeing it

[13:16:31] <SirSceptalot> actually I can just carry on looking into it while it's doing what it's doing

[13:17:41] <xe0n> sooo yeah few days work if you're not sure whatcha doing
[13:17:47] <SirSceptalot> like how do I/does it handle vendor specific drivers, like touchpad drivers, if I start by setting up a vm to capture from?
[13:17:55] <xe0n> yep need to use some variables in there
[13:17:58] <xe0n> and configure all that stuff
[13:18:01] <xe0n> can give you a hand when it comes to it
[13:18:12] <xe0n> winpe config

[14:17:04] <teh_f4ll3n> Damn that camera "bar" on the back of Pixel 6 is ugly af
[14:19:28] <Telgareith> BWMerlin: no they are not
[14:19:50] <Telgareith> the hyperv one makes an actual VM for each container
[14:20:07] <xe0n> yes BWMerlin
[14:20:36] <Telgareith> am I confused with something else then? I was just looking at this recently
[14:20:38] <BWMerlin> I *think* the proper name is "Containers on Windows", this documentation isn't super clear as to *exactly* what they are describing with containers
[14:20:55] <BWMerlin> https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/windowscontainers/quick-start/set-up-environment?tabs=Windows-Server
[14:20:55] <xe0n> provide some context
[14:21:20] <xe0n> uses hyper-v
[14:21:27] <xe0n> as per the requirements :P
[14:22:21] <Telgareith> https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/windowscontainers/manage-containers/hyperv-container
[14:22:23] <BWMerlin> Never worked with containers before, but I like the idea sounds good rather than having heaps of VM's for different functions
[14:22:41] <Telgareith> my link compares the two methods
[14:23:00] <xe0n> nice
[14:23:01] <Telgareith> yea
[14:23:09] <Telgareith> <3 containers
[14:23:14] <Telgareith> I still suck at them
[14:23:41] <BWMerlin> Context, I am building up new VM's (SQL, Veeam and so on)
[14:23:41] <Telgareith> can't get a straight answer what k8s flavor to install on my proxmox host
[14:23:48] <xe0n> just use vms...
[14:23:52] <Telgareith> yea
[14:24:01] <BWMerlin> Why is that?
[14:24:10] <xe0n> you were complaining about the previous dude doing shitty things, well you're going to end up in the same situation if you're not careful.
[14:24:20] <xe0n> because it needs to be supportable, and since you're not really sure, you're going to try and learn in prod
[14:24:27] <xe0n> so i suggest you mess with them for a period of time in your lab
[14:24:57] <xe0n> and then speak with your head office about how they do it, and what guidance they have on them 
[14:25:00] <Telgareith> BWMerlin: containers are meant to be immutable
[14:25:03] <xe0n> ideally you need others to be able to support it
[14:25:16] <xe0n> and when it comes to backup, use the tried and true method, vms
[14:25:25] <Telgareith> yea
[14:25:41] <Telgareith> you *don't* backup deployed containers
[14:26:06] <Telgareith> just the container registry
[14:26:25] <Telgareith> there's exceptions
[14:26:38] <xe0n> you're building infrastructure that should last longer than you're around the place, and it needs to just work.
[14:26:47] <xe0n> if you're fussing around with things like backup, errrr be careful
[14:27:35] <BWMerlin> Yes, which is why I am wondering if I am thinking far enough ahead, like Sever 2022 is GA so should I not be using that rather than the outgoing (in a long time) 2019?
[14:28:08] <BWMerlin> So along the same lines is containers not the way forward?  If I am building systems up should I not use this as the time to container things?
[14:28:08] <Telgareith> depends on policy
[14:28:31] <Telgareith> veeam won't containerize at all afaik
[14:29:20] <Telgareith> too much of a heavyweight on the directories you'd need to save data from
[14:29:22] <xe0n> we said speak with veeam to get guidance on what to build
[14:29:26] <xe0n> so float these questions past them
[14:30:02] <BWMerlin> Or I can read the manual
[14:30:03] <xe0n> https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/release-health/status-windows-server-2022
[14:30:34] <xe0n> keep an eye on that till list is less
[14:30:44] <xe0n> if you run other 2019 boxes, you should be using 2019
[14:30:48] <xe0n> not throwing another os into the mix
[14:30:52] <xe0n> has head office said 2022 is okay?
[14:30:55] <xe0n> are they running it?
[14:30:57] <xe0n> are they licensed?
[14:30:58] <DrZak> not so many yet
[14:31:12] <DrZak> i would deploy it in perhaps end of '22
[14:31:30] <xe0n> eh sooner is fine, but its been GA for two months and you're already throwing it in there
[14:31:36] <xe0n> whats the software lifecycle policy?
[14:31:39] <xe0n> has it been approved?
[14:31:43] <xe0n> does your hardware fully support it?
[14:31:48] <xe0n> does veeam support it?
[14:31:56] <BWMerlin> Yep head office has 2022 released to all the schools and KMS is up and running for it as well
[14:32:03] <xe0n> okay great
[14:32:20] <BWMerlin> Yes Veeam supports it (I know, I read that part of the manual)
[14:32:27] <Telgareith> yea, speced out a lowish end machine  for work to buy 3 of from super micro for shits 'n giggles. $10k servers even with only 16 physical cores
[14:32:42] <xe0n> where's your backup vm going to run, on the same host it's backing up?
[14:32:50] <BWMerlin> Of course
[14:32:55] <xe0n> then thats not correct
[14:32:59] <BWMerlin> I know
[14:32:59] <xe0n> backup should be on its own infrastructure.
[14:33:02] <xe0n> then stop!
[14:33:07] <BWMerlin> But I don't have another server
[14:33:09] <xe0n> you need to speak with head office about the situation
[14:33:18] <xe0n> yes and as i said earlier today...its a project that requires approval and funding
[14:33:23] <xe0n> funding = buy more hardware, storage, etc
[14:33:37] <xe0n> you're just doing your own thing, which isn't really recommended
[14:33:46] <xe0n> you will run into issues down the track, what issues? i dunno...restoring possibly?
[14:33:50] <teh_f4ll3n> happy monday everyone
[14:33:50] <xe0n> what happens when the host goes down completely?
[14:34:05] <xe0n> and you need to restore...
[14:34:06] <BWMerlin> Next business day
[14:34:08] <xe0n> rebuild veeam?
[14:34:21] <xe0n> if the host that veeam lives on is down...how are you going to recover?
[14:34:35] <xe0n> if things are hosed, whats your plan?
[14:34:35] <BWMerlin> And yes, that is the official answer from head office as to why they didn't supply the schools with two server for fail over for the server refresh going on
[14:34:51] <xe0n> IF YOUR VEEAM VM IS HOSED WHAT DO YOU DO
[14:34:52] <xe0n> LOL

[14:40:37] <SirSceptalot> because I don't know why default setting is like that
[14:40:41] <xe0n> BWMerlin: lets lay it out how it is....when you arrived, backups were limited\non-existant for somethings yes?
[14:40:55] <BWMerlin> And nothing has changed
[14:40:58] <xe0n> great
[14:41:08] <xe0n> so a. it's not your problem to fix in the fastest possible way
[14:41:23] <xe0n> b. they purchased shadow protect, so head office\whoever is willing to spend money on a backup solution
[14:41:32] <xe0n> the solution isnt spin up some new boxes and install a free version of a backup product
[14:41:41] <teh_f4ll3n> SirSceptalot only sick people enjoy that
[14:42:03] <xe0n> you should contact veeam sales, get an idea of cost and possibly a quote on what you'd like to achieve, and present it to head office
[14:42:10] <xe0n> get approval and funds to proceed
[14:42:10] <BWMerlin> The ShadowProtect license is for the servers/vm's they provide.  Above and beyond we need to buy our own product/license
[14:42:27] <xe0n> okay great, so you need to get approval to spend money there
[14:42:39] <xe0n> and lay out a case where basically they can't say no, tell them of the risks, explain what would happen if things go down
[14:42:48] <xe0n> the answer isnt something free...backup costs money
[14:42:50] <BWMerlin> I have spoken to veeam sales, talked to them and they said I would be fine on community edition but if I wanted to back to sharepoint I would need to pay
[14:43:16] <xe0n> so licensing is one thing, backup to sharepoint may not be the greatest solution, so you need to look at other options, at least compare
[14:43:29] <xe0n> c. put it forward to management, they will make a decision based on your advice
[14:43:40] <BWMerlin> Back up t sharepoint is the offsite of the 321
[14:44:01] <xe0n> d. have you got the local storage to store it, a dedicated (new) location?
[14:44:05] <xe0n> that also requires funds.
[14:44:38] <xe0n> and should be taken into account for reliable, scalable, and for long gevity

[14:52:24] <ny0x> morning
[14:52:44] <riff-IRC> mornin
[14:52:57] <SirSceptalot> damn, that sounds like a size company that really should have money for backup...
[14:53:02] <xe0n> yeah lol!
[14:55:05] <SirSceptalot> if they don't *want* to spend that money, that's pretty dumb. It they really don't *have* the money then they're probably doing down if something substantial hits
[14:55:49] <BWMerlin> It is a school, most of our users are students, we are also in a low econ area
[14:56:22] <SirSceptalot> ah. I have no idea what kind of environment schools have
[14:56:38] <SirSceptalot> and what kind of backup requirments
[14:57:02] <thegodsquirrel> As a former private school sysadmin, I feel your pain... BWMerlin 
[14:57:02] <BWMerlin> A couple of VM's and one host system
[14:57:41] <SirSceptalot> I hope xe0n doesn't shoot me for this, but if the things that need to be backed up are limited, have you considered Synology ABB?
[14:57:56] <Activ8> this 2fa/mfa is starting to piss me off big time lol
[14:58:08] <SirSceptalot> I don't think I saw the start of this convo though, so I might be missing intel
[14:58:24] <BWMerlin> I believe with do have a synology, not sure what model off the top of my head
[14:58:59] <SirSceptalot> I think any synology model with a "+" in the name has free Active Backup for Business
[14:59:00] <BWMerlin> xe0n: says I need to wheel in a heap of consultants as I cannot be trusted to do the job properly myself
[14:59:14] <BWMerlin> Mean while I sit here with next to no backup solution in place
[14:59:24] <xe0n> so im saying get guidance and to confirm your plan is sound
[14:59:29] <xe0n> jeeez
[14:59:36] <xe0n> you really misunderstand things lol!
[14:59:46] <xe0n> because all your guidance so far is irc and reddit
[14:59:52] <xe0n> probably not the best
[15:01:11] <xe0n> do what you want at the end of the day, but dont say we didn't tell you so
[15:01:18] <xe0n> it wasn't just me that echo'd the same thing...
[15:01:47] <xe0n> i speak from experience, you dont think i haven't been burned in the past?
[15:02:23] <BWMerlin> You want me to email head office who doesn't care
[15:02:46] <BWMerlin> Okay, I tell you what, you send me exactly what you want me to send to them, I will send it off and show you the reply
[15:03:54] <Activ8> BWMerlin - you not got a technical consultant on your side
[15:03:59] <Activ8> ?
[15:04:27] <xe0n> you build whatcha want BWMerlin :)
[15:04:29] <BWMerlin> No, we can reach out to some third part "approved" vendors who will charge us for there services
[15:04:34] <xe0n> put a solution in place, do it!
[15:05:02] <BWMerlin> Like when I wanted help with something in airwatch I was told to go to one of them rather than getting any support from head office
[15:06:04] <thegodsquirrel> You need to show the HoS that there is value in the proposed solutions, make a plan, start with backups.  Present a scenario where there is a failure of the vmhost and what that means for the school and a typical day.  You can't say talk about how the sky will fall with those folks, they need facts.  
[15:06:04] <xe0n> get support from head office, they're the first ones to go to!
[15:06:06] <xe0n> if any situation
[15:06:07] <xe0n> LOL
[15:06:13] <xe0n> in*
[15:06:28] <xe0n> always HO first, then if they can't provide, third party, or if you can find the answer yourself, great!
[15:07:11] <xe0n> you want to align with their strategy, you want them to be able to support you in times of need haha
[15:07:20] <BWMerlin> Okay, just for you xe0n I will email them saying I am looking for a backup solution, what do they recommend and will they help implement it?  Sound good?
[15:07:25] <xe0n> it's all about having their support :)
[15:07:34] <xe0n> sounds like a great idea!
[15:07:40] <BWMerlin> You give them far too much credit
[15:08:04] <xe0n> and say hey i've been researching veeam, i think it fits the bill, here's the reasons why, we can use the community edition but i think it'd be good to backup to sharepoint\other locations which requires the full version, what do you suggest?
[15:08:16] <xe0n> why are you set on veeam, there's other solutions out there too
[15:08:43] <xe0n> it seems to be the defacto for smb, sure, but if thats you're reasoning because reddit\irc\other say so, then sweet
[15:08:49] <xe0n> but you should also investigate other alternatives
[15:09:13] <xe0n> also mention hey you've got shadow protect, is it an option to purchase licenses for the newer version that support whatever you're running
[15:09:35] <BWMerlin> I have sent them exactly what I wrote above, I will let you know the response
[15:09:39] <xe0n> tbh, that's the first thing i would suggest, they have history with shadowprotect, so why not use their products still if they continue to use it with other stuff
[15:09:44] <xe0n> nice one
[15:11:15] <xe0n> "hey the version of shadow protect thats currently used here doesn't support modern versions of windows, would you recommend looking at getting licensing for the later version of shadow protect so we can backup <blah> (for instance...your new 2022 machines) since it isn't supported, or do you think i should be looking at another product. I've investigated veeam and the community 
[15:11:15] <xe0n> edition looks like it will fit our needs, however if we want to backup off site it requires the full version which comes at a cost"
[15:11:37] <xe0n> get the decision rolling

[17:03:46] <mistiry> isnt that what i said to do?
[17:04:06] <PublicWiFi> sorry didn't mean to make you google it for me
[17:04:15] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> yes
[17:04:22] <PublicWiFi> yeah
[17:04:29] <PublicWiFi> I wonder why my variable is coming up empty stil
[17:04:35] <PublicWiFi> ehh ill figure it out
[17:04:52] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> well no because this is using an object to pass the values rather than just passing the output directly
[17:05:02] <Lancehead> Guys, I need dinner recommendations 
[17:05:05] <Lancehead> Nothing I have to cook for too long 
[17:05:18] <mistiry> well, its doing new-object in the script block itself, which i didnt give an example of
[17:05:37] <mistiry> but its the same thing. $Varible = Invoke-Command and then you can parse $Variable however you want
[17:05:48] <mistiry> just parsing an object instead of string in that case
[17:06:20] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> I just like the object answer better cause it's more reusable. You can throw whatever you want into the object
[17:06:38] <mistiry> its just a more complete answser that what i gave. and yes, objects are nice.
[17:07:10] <mistiry> can do nice things like reference $Variable.Name or whatever
[17:07:14] <Lancehead> Guuuys give dinner reccomendations 
[17:07:19] <mistiry> tripe

[17:16:31] <Activ8> I might have to make some
[17:16:41] <Lancehead> i'm an inspiration 
[17:18:56] <JollyRgrs> i love making wraps. my fav is blazing buffalo chicken (deli sliced) with romaine, tomato, bacon crumbles, pepper jack cheese and a little bit of ranch and then cayenne pepper on it
[17:19:14] <JollyRgrs> toss it on the griddle to get that great toasted outside and to hold the shape... b/c i don't make "lite" wraps
[17:19:17] <Lancehead> im so hungry. fuck 
[17:19:22] <vinrock> i cant make wraps, burritos or sandwiches that i enjoy
[17:19:29] <JollyRgrs> why not?
[17:19:29] <vinrock> unless someone else is making it i dont want it
[17:19:31] <vinrock> idk
[17:19:34] <vinrock> it just doesnt taste the same
[17:19:40] <JollyRgrs> you need to git gud
[17:19:42] <SirSceptalot> This time next year on amazon: cooking with sysadmins
[17:19:46] <vinrock> i can mae a burger or a steak
[17:19:47] <JollyRgrs> my own made are the best ones i've had
[17:19:50] <vinrock> just not those
[17:19:51] <Lancehead> lol sceptalot 
[17:20:04] <Activ8> That would make an awesome book
[17:20:13] <JollyRgrs> vinrock: when you go to Moe's, watch them how they wrap up a burrito
[17:20:14] <mistiry> vinrock: i can make them, but i agree that i like them better when they're made for me
[17:20:16] <JollyRgrs> now you also know!
[17:20:26] <mistiry> at least wraps and sandwiches
[17:20:33] <vinrock> yeah mistiry
[17:20:40] <JollyRgrs> I mean, i love when someone makes them for me, there's no denying that
[17:20:45] <vinrock> i technically know how to make them, but something always seems off unless its soeone else doing it
[17:20:48] <JollyRgrs> but my best ones i've had... made by me
[17:20:52] <mistiry> but like, ill never make a sub at home as good as a good sandwich shop
[17:21:07] <vinrock> with subs im like
[17:21:12] <vinrock> bad at stacking the deli meat or somethin
[17:21:13] <JollyRgrs> yeah, i don't have a meat steamer like Firehouse
[17:21:22] <vinrock> wut
[17:21:24] <vinrock> they steam the meat?
[17:21:28] <mistiry> ill never make a burrito as good as the authentic mexican restaurant with mexican grandmas working the kitchen
[17:21:37] <PublicWiFi> turns out im not clever lol
[17:21:41] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> vinrock I can technically make pesto but gatdamn it tastes better when my spouse makes it
[17:21:45] <JollyRgrs> vinrock: for me, i love the layering, you need to give some folds to the meat so it isn't like a subway sammich
[17:21:48] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> like x100 better
[17:22:03] <mistiry> JollyRgrs: exactly, i can make a good sandwich, but would never stand up to firehouse or public
[17:22:05] <JollyRgrs> vinrock: yeah, most of the meat... that's literally the whole back wall is steamer things for the meat
[17:22:06] <mistiry> publix
[17:22:11] <vinrock> yeah when i make a normal sammich on bread slices i try to put like, a roll or wave in the meat so its not just flat slices
[17:22:16] <vinrock> pube licks
[17:22:29] <JollyRgrs> don't be mockin publix (where shopping is a pleasure)
[17:22:30] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> I don't get the steamer thing that Firehouse does. Just makes everything doughy and weird.
[17:22:38] <vinrock> i get sammiches from there when im in florida
[17:22:39] <JollyRgrs> what? no...
[17:22:40] <mistiry> publix subs are food of gods
[17:22:43] <JollyRgrs> it's only the meat in the steamer
[17:22:44] <vinrock> they got dat boar's head
[17:22:47] <JollyRgrs> bread goes through the toaster
[17:22:58] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> maybe I went to a defective one then
[17:23:04] <mistiry> vinrock: funny enough, i actually preferred the publix brand when getting turkey subs
[17:23:07] <JollyRgrs> @bdenlinger but if you get firehouse "to go", it might get soggy in transit
[17:23:13] <JollyRgrs> mistiry: me2
[17:23:21] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> Penn Station is more my jam
[17:23:21] <JollyRgrs> not only cheaper, but tastes just as good and sometimes better
[17:23:21] <vinrock> ive been pleasantly surprised by firehouse

[17:23:51] <vinrock> kill urself
[17:23:52] <JollyRgrs> club on a sub and meatball are my 2 goto sammies there, but the ny steamer... hook n ladder... all good
[17:23:55] <Lancehead> lmaoooo 
[17:24:01] <Lancehead> Subway is decent where I live actually
[17:24:03] <JollyRgrs> subway? lol... what mistiry said
[17:24:04] <mistiry> JollyRgrs: steamed italian for me
[17:24:20] <mistiry> and gimme dat pickle spear
[17:24:25] <JollyRgrs> subway is if you want a salad with a small helping of meat
[17:24:35] <JollyRgrs> and their bread (that used to be decent) has gone downhill in the last 10 yrs or so
[17:24:45] <JollyRgrs> hold the pickle pls
[17:24:54] <vinrock> im not a fan of the subway sugarbread
[17:25:02] <AnonymooseReddtr> subway? meh 
[17:25:05] <AnonymooseReddtr> just don't get the chicken
[17:25:10] <vinrock> or "tuna"
[17:25:10] <AnonymooseReddtr> newsflash its not chicken
[17:25:13] <mistiry> subway as a franchise is fucking huge tho
[17:25:19] <AnonymooseReddtr> i'm afraid to know what the "meatballs" are
[17:25:23] <vinrock> it used to be the second largest chain after mcdicks
[17:25:26] <yuken> Hmm. So, in a wood gasifier, you want to cool down the gas before it reaches your ICE, to filter out certain vaporized particulates. what if
[17:25:26] <mistiry> also pretty sure the tuna thing was disproven
[17:25:28] <vinrock> might still be
[17:25:34] <yuken> you cool it down in a peltier generator or a stirling engine?
[17:25:41] <yuken> Actually use the heat energy to also produce electricity!
[17:26:18] <mistiry> vinrock: i think it still is
[17:26:30] <mistiry> there are more subways than starbucks
[17:26:37] <mistiry> people always seem shocked by that
[17:26:53] <mistiry> i think there were as many subways as there are here in every country i have visited, save for maybe india and thailand
[17:26:54] <PublicWiFi> wood gas engines are dope

[17:27:18] <yuken> PublicWiFi, I want to build one, and I was wondering if it'd even make sense to attach an engine that runs off heat to the cooling process.
[17:27:31] <PublicWiFi> what do you mean
[17:27:32] <JollyRgrs> mistiry: yeah, the "no tuna" myth was b/c of the way they tested, it wasn't testing for processed tuna or something
[17:27:32] <yuken> YOu want to get rid of the heat anyway... why have it leech into the environment?
[17:27:46] <yuken> PublicWiFi, you cool down the gas before it hits your ICE. Why let the heat just go into the environment?
[17:27:50] <PublicWiFi> too bad peltiers are insanely low efficiency lol
[17:27:52] <yuken> Stirling engines or peltier generators and so on.
[17:27:58] <yuken> sure, but efficiency is >0%.
[17:28:07] <PublicWiFi> every thing will be heat eventually
[17:28:09] <PublicWiFi> xD
[17:28:11] <yuken> especially in a cold environment.

[17:28:50] <yuken> What about Jersey Mikes, @bdenlinger?
[17:28:52] <mistiry> everything will COOL eventually
[17:29:01] <JollyRgrs> pretty sure even standard gas station "quick pick" subs are better
[17:29:11] <mistiry> at least on par, most of the time
[17:29:18] <thegodsquirrel> Wawa
[17:29:19] <PublicWiFi> i mean everything we do will end up radiating as heat eventually
[17:29:22] <JollyRgrs> jersey mikes is nice. it's very different than firehouse, so to me, it is just whichever one i'm craving more

[18:02:33] <JollyRgrs> No one consulted me about it. They’re like, ‘Hey, do you wanna promote this album?’ I was like, ‘Whoa, there’s an album?’ And then they were like, ‘Yeah, you wanna promote it?’ And part of me is like, yeah, that’d be cool. I’ve always wanted to be, like, that actor who has the vanity album. You know, I hope it gets a million copies and I get this platinum album on my
[18:02:35] <JollyRgrs> wall. But then on the other hand, I’m like, I don’t think I’m being compensated for this beyond the, whatever $15,000 an episode I was making for the show. I think I’m gonna say no. A hard pass on promoting your album.

[19:17:43] <fritzwastaken> at least its in the quotes
[19:17:50] <sintax> ha
[19:17:57] <int0x1C8> well, I was thinking of a different quote, but that works too
[19:18:02] <fritzwastaken> So as you all know, we’ve been trying to work on the trinary air proposition for quite awhile now but we’ve come across some serious issues.
[19:18:04] <fritzwastaken> Firstly, “Dr.” Rothkoin supposed that trinary air is able to solidify and then be able to handle the weight of a fully grown adult - however! We’ve tried experiments with rats and let me tell you, fur doesn’t not come out of trinary air easily.
[19:18:06] <fritzwastaken> Secondly, “Dr.” Rothkoin never states how many RPM needed to accelerate binary air to trinary. So how are we supposed to replicate this? By guessing and checking over and over and over and over.
[19:18:08] <fritzwastaken> Thirdly, I hate Rothkoin.

[19:19:09] <fritzwastaken> I'll spitball a few ideas- Have you tried exposing your experimental chamber to a superconducting monopolar magnet? The ole 1.26 Mw slap might be enought to locally disrupt the DuBois field.
[19:19:10] <sintax> these are the ghetto highlights - Coolio
[19:19:48] <fritzwastaken> This quack was thoroughly disproven years ago. It's not trinary air, it's just a very complicated way of making a carbon-hydrogen polymer aerogel that has a refractive index of 0 with visible light. Try illuminating a sample of it with UV-C light, or wetting it with some very low molecular weight silicone oil. Warning, using siloxane based oils with a weight and viscosity above 100 cSt may cause some
[19:19:50] <fritzwastaken> rather exciting fireworks.

[21:41:03] <Casteil> I think I might settle.. 500 is quite a bit more to throw at it than I really wanted to

[22:13:41] <RatherbPhishing> Hey folks, I have an honest question that I cannot seem to find a clear answer to regarding PKI: I am trying to stand up a 2 tier pki environment with 2 enterprise sub ca's servicing NA and EU, while also being redundant with one another so that one can facilitate the other's function if needed if it is restarted or corrupt or whatever. With that in mind would I just stand up the 
[22:13:41] <RatherbPhishing> second ca just like the first from the root certificate? is it correct that these cannot be clustered if they are on separate host environments? Thanks so much!
[22:14:44] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> Root cert store should be offline.
[22:14:49] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> So yes basically
[22:14:53] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> root CA, not cert store, but still
[22:15:15] <RatherbPhishing> yeah, sorry, that was a little confusing. I have a single root (offline) with 2 enterprise cas i want to be redundant essentially
[22:15:20] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> you sign the second subordinate the same way, and you'll have certificates coming out of each showing a slightly different path to the same root (depending on which CA signs what)
[22:15:25] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> but the certs are interchangable once issued
[22:15:56] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> basically, they're both trusted (since they're subordinates of your root) but you don't have to cluster/redundancy them
[22:16:03] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> since one or the other's issuance will be equally trusted
[22:16:06] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> unless you revoke one
