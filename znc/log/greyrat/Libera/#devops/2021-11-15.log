[14:36:17] <rawtaz> kwilczynski: thanks! gonna want itt for sure
[14:36:40] <rawtaz> kwilczynski: is there an example of how it's "trivial" to break out of a docker container? i dont really get why it would be so trivial.
[14:55:48] <kwilczynski> Trivial?
[14:56:11] <kwilczynski> What makes you think it's trivial? :)
[14:57:48] <rawtaz> you mentioned bubblewrap earlier. so i took a look at it. https://github.com/containers/bubblewrap says "These tools are not suitable to give to unprivileged users, because it is trivial to turn such access into to a fully privileged root shell on the host" (regarding e.g. Docker). in what way is it "trivial"?
[14:58:19] <rawtaz> sounds like bullshit to me. sure, it's trivial to break out of a misconfigured container, but a regular properly configured container isnt something you just pop out of with the click of a button afaik. am i mistaken?
[14:58:40] <rawtaz> (the quote is in relation to things like Docker)
[15:01:41] <kwilczynski> Well.
[15:01:44] <kwilczynski> You'd be surprised.
[15:02:23] <kwilczynski> Docker also gives you a false sense of security, to some extent, just because they put a lot of effort into securing their implementation/approach/runtime.
[15:02:29] <kwilczynski> The containers on their own are atrocious.
[15:02:37] <kwilczynski> There is no security.
[15:03:17] <rawtaz> right. but in what way would it be "trivial" to break out of a docker container? i mean, put me in a docker container. in what "trivial" way can i simply break out of it?
[15:03:50] <rawtaz> (i realize we're talking about container isolation here, so not the same as like breaking out of a VM, but you get what i mean)
[15:04:36] <kwilczynski> OK.
[15:04:49] <rawtaz> if it's that simple as they make it sound, then im missing a lot about security and containers lol :D
[15:05:05] <rawtaz> and pretty much every non-hardened container on the internet would be easy to break out of..
[15:05:11] <kwilczynski> I am not sure what you are afer.
[15:05:14] <kwilczynski> after*
[15:05:16] <rawtaz> so i cant see how what they say is really what it sounds like
[15:05:23] <kwilczynski> bubblewrap is just another sanboxing mechanism.
[15:05:25] <rawtaz> good, then theyre just full of it and we can all relax :)
[15:05:32] <kwilczynski> It's not orthogonal to containers.
[15:06:38] <kwilczynski> container escapes, which is bit of a misnomer but it stuck, or rather namespace escapes can be trivial depending on what is being done to it.
[15:06:58] <kwilczynski> Docker people tried hard to make certain things hard, so it is definitely harder than it used to be.
[15:07:07] <rawtaz> do you have something else than e.g. the docker socket being writable in mind?
[15:07:11] <kwilczynski> Trivial? No, I don't think so.
[15:07:30] <kwilczynski> Docker socket has nothing to do with container escapes.
[15:07:41] <kwilczynski> podman has no Docker socket and has similar issues.

[15:39:45] <rawtaz> docker socket has *tons* to do with container escapes - if a container can write to the socket it's game over unless you filter the API calls it writes
[15:39:57] <rawtaz> yeah its not the only attack surface
[15:40:08] <rawtaz> i agree, it shant be called trivial i think :)
[15:41:01] <kwilczynski> That's not container escape.
[15:41:19] <kwilczynski> That is lack of understanding how to use the tool correctly/securely.
[15:41:22] <kwilczynski> :)
[15:41:48] <kwilczynski> It's like complaining that rm -Rf / did a boo boo when you added sudo in front of it. :)
[15:42:01] <kwilczynski> Hehe.
[15:42:14] <kwilczynski> I believe this is called "footgun".
[15:42:55] <rawtaz> sure
[15:43:50] <kwilczynski> Find a minute and look at some of the papers (and find more in Google).
[15:43:59] <kwilczynski> About some really peculiar escapes.
[15:44:16] <rawtaz> will do
[15:44:34] <kwilczynski> There is, for example, one problem at the moment in sysfs that would allow someone to yank their devices from under their nose causing an ourage/DoS the system.
[15:44:41] <kwilczynski> This is in the PCI sub-system.
[15:44:49] <kwilczynski> Something I am working with Kees Cook to fix.
[15:44:52] <kwilczynski> :)
[15:45:17] <rawtaz> is that work tracked somewhere publically?
[15:46:52] <kwilczynski> No.
[15:47:10] <rawtaz> secrets :3
[15:47:12] <rawtaz> i get it
[15:47:20] <rawtaz> two guys, secret stuff
[15:47:28] <kwilczynski> Haha.
[15:47:55] <kwilczynski> rawtaz: https://github.com/KSPP/linux/issues/139
[15:48:00] <rawtaz> so that sysfs issue is a kernel thing i guess?
[15:48:04] <kwilczynski> The fix/proposal is tracked.
[15:48:10] <rawtaz> ah ok
[15:48:44] <kwilczynski> Yes, sysfs/kernfs.
[15:52:02] <kwilczynski> Kernel in some places lacks support... lags behind.
[15:52:13] <kwilczynski> Addition of namespaces turned some things upside down.
[15:52:45] <kwilczynski> Especially old security models governing access to resources.
[15:52:55] <kwilczynski> Ahh, anyway.
[15:53:11] <kwilczynski> I know nothing about this sort of things. I am not a security person. :)
[15:57:04] <rawtaz> i can tell. you seem to have no clue about security aspects :-D

I would like to make a local vm machine to gather emails from a shared server and make outlook from computers connect with imap so they can grow as the need. I dont know if this can be done and in what direction to start searching for information.
[22:55:48] <rawtaz> ttnk: what operating system do you want to host the VM on?
[22:55:59] <rawtaz> and does it have to be a VM, or can it be a docker container?

[22:59:58] <ttnk> rawtaz: well not really, i dont know if it possible to run a local imap server to download emails from server and what software to use for this task, and what about sending emails, i still use the principal server or i have to install smtp server too but i wont have a static ip on the secondary server
[23:00:47] <rawtaz> for imap server, you can use e.g. dovecot, which is very well established and good software
[23:01:31] <rawtaz> for fetching mail, people often use procmail i think, but there's also e.g. isync, but i think that already requires imap on the source server.
[23:02:05] <rawtaz> doesnt the current mail server support imap? and why do you need *outlook* on those clients to download mail using *imap*?
[23:02:10] <rawtaz> what shared server is it anyway?
[23:02:27] <ttnk> hostgator
[23:02:56] <rawtaz> and what protocols do they support for mail?
[23:03:05] <rawtaz> what is the actual mail server software?
[23:03:11] <ttnk> yes, it supports imap, the thing is that very big images are being sent daily and some accounts are growing too much
[23:04:45] <ttnk> they prefer outlook rather than thunderbird, i already tried to make them use tb but some format issues with tables 
[23:05:12] <rawtaz> how is it a problem that the accounts grow?

[23:10:16] <ttnk> not migrating, i would like to download emails to the new one and use it as an imap server
[23:10:19] <rawtaz> better to just move to another server, if you thikn the current one is costing too much

[23:45:29] <rawtaz> perhaps after all his idea isnt that bad. i mean it seems overly complicated, i'd just replace it with another server or similar if i didnt want to pay for their service storage
[23:45:46] <kwilczynski> What idea? :)
[23:45:51] <kwilczynski> I know nothing!
[23:45:53] <rawtaz> but perhaps it's not THAT overly complicated to just set up a server that pulls mail from the main one and then removes them, basically like pop
[23:46:02] <rawtaz> ah never mind :)
[23:46:19] <kwilczynski> :-(
[23:46:25] * kwilczynski weeps
[23:47:09] <rawtaz> mailserver at hostgator is storing too large account, so they wanted to set up a second server that pulls mail from the first one and serves it over imap to outlook clients.
[23:52:02] <kwilczynski> This only makes sense over setting their own MTA... as Hostgator might be doing some SMTP magic to ensure their IPs are not blacklisted and such...
[23:52:18] <kwilczynski> SMTP nowadays is a minefield.
[23:52:46] <kwilczynski> If Hostgator is not doing anything special, then perhaps does not make sense to have two things.
[23:56:18] <rawtaz> yeah
[23:56:21] <rawtaz> i think its complicating it
[23:56:37] <rawtaz> if they have that large accounts, either keep them at some place where they have the space, or pay for the space.
