[00:01:03] <starfoxtthc> namarrgon still didnt work
[00:01:16] <Namarrgon> starfoxtthc: "didn't work"?
[00:01:23] <kevr> perrierjouet: it is simple here. the issue is that the python you're using doesn't have that package in it's pythonpath
[00:01:25] <Namarrgon> did you get an error?
[00:01:31] <perrierjouet> kevr: I wont take more time of yours, for conda purposes I think I installed all python stuff with pip
[00:01:34] <kevr> figure out why that is the case, and you will be able to resolve it.
[00:02:05] <kevr> that module/package, that is

[00:17:17] <copygirl> I was wondering yesterday, if maybe you beautiful, smart people could help me out with something. I'm running a Minecraft server on a VPS and every now and then, I have connection issues, while others can connect to it just fine.
[00:17:56] <starfoxtthc> i dont think i can update archlinux-keyring if i have an pacman -Sy running already
[00:18:01] <copygirl> This happened before, for someone else. Routing the connection through another server corrects the issue, so is it something with the particular route it chose?
[00:18:01] <starfoxtthc> its waiting for me to say y
[00:18:34] <earnestly> starfoxtthc: pacman -Qi | awk '$1 == "Name" {n=$NF}; /Caleb Maclennan/ {print n}'
[00:18:52] <starfoxtthc> earnestly thanks
[00:19:14] <earnestly> Hopefully you have ssd to speed that up a bit
[00:19:16] <copygirl> And, like, is there anything to "fix" this issue? I thought the internet was designed such that when there were issues with a particular route, it would re-route to improve things.
[00:19:19] <starfoxtthc> i just found out pacman Qi lists all the packages (i think) and then i grped that
[00:19:22] <tonitch> copygirl: try monitoring your vps, sometimes, network is not the issue
[00:19:36] <earnestly> That would have been brutal if I did this on spinning rust btrfs on 5400rpm
[00:19:37] <starfoxtthc> earnestly yes
[00:19:40] <tonitch> try free -h for instance, minecraft used to eat a lot of ram
[00:19:56] <copygirl> Oh and, tracepath would sometimes take a long time on certain hops, and packet drop was high when running ping. That's like .. the extend of my "debugging knowledge" there.

[00:23:52] <wadu> My Xorg display 0 seems to randomly crash. It's happened a couple times before, but this is the first chance I've got to collect logs. When it happens, I can't launch any new programs, but already running programs keep working. The problem is fixed by restarting SDDM (opening a tty, logging in and running `sudo restart sddm`).

[02:58:22] <Steini> exactly, this is why we said you need some automation
[02:58:52] <quantum_> Time to drink...
[02:58:57] <wadu> palasso: I tried LightDM and it didn't fix it. I then rebooted since that could possibly help, but LightDM doesn't even want to work from boot. I had to manually restart it (systemctl start lightdm) (It was enabled, it just showed it had exited with code 1)
[02:59:10] <MacGyver> Same for the HTTP challenge, but that's precisely what certbot takes care of for you.
[02:59:11] <wadu> After the reboot it was also still not fixed

[02:59:40] <MacGyver> You get a periodically renewed challenge, and you need to prove that you own the domain by making something on the domain reflect that challenge back at LE.

[03:00:02] <MacGyver> And both need some automation, because Let's Encrypt needs automation.
[03:00:04] <palasso> wadu: are you sure when you rebooted, you rebooted via LightDM?
[03:00:30] <wadu> Yes, 100%. SDDM and LightDM have different greeters. 
[03:00:31] <MacGyver> If you don't want to deal with automation, just pay some other CA $20 for a cert that expires every other year.
[03:02:35] <wadu> So what I did was, I disabled SDDM, enabled LightDM. Rebooted. The screen showed a blinking cursor, I switched to a tty, systemctl status lightdm showed it had crashed, then I maually started lightdm with systemctl, it showed the greeter, I logged in, opened nvidia settings and it still didn't show the options
[03:02:52] <wadu> Is it possible my entire X install is just fucked ? I've had some other issues with it as well

[03:03:32] <MacGyver> I'd start by removing (i.e. MOVING to a different folder) all manual X config.
[03:03:44] <quantum_> MacGyver: Is DANE a suitable substitute for LE certs?
[03:03:46] <MacGyver> See how it fares if it has to completely autoconfigure.
[03:04:11] <MacGyver> quantum_: The question doesn't make sense.
[03:04:32] <MacGyver> quantum_: DANE only tells clients which certs / CAs should be in use for a domain, it doesn't replace certificates.

[03:05:08] <quantum_> Help me understand this statement then:  "mail does not need a webpki cert. ideally you should be using dane to bind mail cert key and ignoring webpki for it"
[03:05:21] <wadu> MacGyver: I don't have any manual X config files. Everytime I tried to generate any with nvidia-xconfig it just blackscreened me untill I removed them.
[03:05:38] <wadu> there's no xorg.conf in /etc/X11 and /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d is empty
[03:05:38] <MacGyver> That's saying that you can get *any* certificate, and then in DNS publish the fact that that certificate should be used.
[03:05:54] <MacGyver> wadu: Don't know then, sorry.
[03:06:04] <MacGyver> quantum_: I also highly doubt the statement itself.

[03:06:58] <MacGyver> But I really doubt that that is true in practice.
[03:07:01] <quantum_> Statement comes from the LE channel.
[03:07:32] <MacGyver> Doesn't change my stance on it.
[03:07:46] <quantum_> dalias, although I don't know his rep.
[03:08:02] <MacGyver> What they're basically saying is that any mail server that wants to send e-mail to you will actually use DANE to verify your certificate.
[03:08:09] <MacGyver> DANE is not old enough for that to be true.
[03:08:20] <palasso> wadu: another post that seems related to your problem (doesn't have any fixes) is this one https://forums.developer.nvidia.com/t/issues-with-missing-menu-options-on-nvidia-settings-on-arch-linux/187549

[10:32:01] <syntaxman> Well... `sudo systemctl daemon-reexec` did not accomplish anything.  Rebooting was needed for the new group to be picked up. :-(
[10:32:19] <grawity> because
[10:32:23] <syntaxman> This is a regression... before systemd, this was not required.
[10:32:49] <grawity> 1) a reexec is not a restart; if a process just execs something, it'll keep the same uid/gid memberships that the original process had
[10:33:09] <grawity> you need it to do the whole "drop down from root" thing that happens during login

[10:33:24] <grawity> 2) I was talking about systemd --user, not about the bloody init
[10:33:40] <grawity> normally your systemd --user instance starts on first login  and stops on last logout
[10:33:56] <grawity> but I think there's an idle timer so that e.g. repeated ssh won't cause it to restart too quickly
[10:34:39] <syntaxman> Ah... misunderstood.  More re-learning coming.
[10:34:40] <grawity> so you'll have to a) log out and wait a minute or so, or b) systemctl restart user@1000.service
[10:34:42] <syntaxman> Thank you.

[13:56:14] <raster> it could also be the vm itself just isnt forwarding network traffic - it's misconfigured or broken.

[14:29:47] <notrot> the other day, for example, I was hitting my head hard on the tmpfiles and sysusers
[14:30:14] <NetSysFir> pingpongball: artix is horribly hacky
[14:30:17] <beastDivision> i have never understood the argument that systemd is overly complex or hard to use. I think it is dead simple to use, the conf files are simple .ini files that are easy to read and understand, basically the same for every service, and it solves a ton of issues sysvinit had. writing sysv init scripts was a nightmare, and trying to understand them was just as bad in my opinion. sure maybe systemd
[14:30:19] <beastDivision> is bloated and complicated behind the scenes, and i think there are valid concerns about other software becoming dependent on it and it leading the linux ecosystem towards homogonization, but damn if it isn't easy to use and just works most of the time

[20:01:47] <enoq> does the kodi package have broken deps?
[20:01:51] <MrElendig> enoq: pacman -Q python
[20:01:59] <enoq> I've got python 3 isntalled
[20:02:06] <AlexC> nah, python broke a lot of programs

[20:02:32] <enoq> yep, that's what I did :)
[20:02:34] <carbolymer> python should be banned
[20:02:40] <notrot> it should!!
[20:02:45] <notrot> just like locales
[20:02:49] <AlexC> MrElendig, well, pacman -Syyu as usual, and half of my python stuff broke this morning
[20:02:51] <AlexC> so.. :D
[20:03:02] <MrElendig> AlexC: 17:15:46    MrElendig │ carbolymer: 1. make sure your mirror doesn't suck
[20:03:08] <Foucault> surprisingly I had no issues
[20:03:11] <Foucault> had to update an AUR package
[20:03:12] <MrElendig> (and the rest of it :P)
[20:03:13] <Foucault> that was it
[20:03:22] <AlexC> ye, i had to recompile my aur stuff
[20:03:30] <AlexC> apart from that works fine now
[20:03:44] <alad> if half your python stuff is from AUR, I have questions
[20:03:51] <AlexC> don't..
[20:03:52] <AlexC> XD
[20:04:09] <notrot> what about NodeRed instead of HA?  
[20:04:19] <MrElendig> notrot: they do different things
[20:04:31] <jelle> oh python3.10 landed, I can dump dnf into the repos /o/
[20:04:32] <notrot> not really, but ok....
[20:04:37] <MrElendig> and nr is in no way a replacement for HA
[20:04:45] <MrElendig> unless you want to write *a lot* of code
[20:04:53] <notrot> that's the spirit!
[20:05:10] <carbolymer> >built on node.js
[20:05:23] <carbolymer> I guess I'll stick with python then
[20:05:38] <notrot> ....besides, why this isn't catching incoming packets?
[20:05:42] <MrElendig> "often" both nr and ha are used at once anyway :p
[20:05:43] <notrot> tcpdump -i enp2s0 -p -n -s 1500 udp port 25827

[23:35:32] <Gaboradon> The article on Rust language could be worded a bit better in the Installation section when talking about the two options ... I kinda started reading into the Rustup section without realizing that's the other option and if I do the first one I don't need that, but it may just be me

[23:46:55] <CaTaCaS> Hello, I have a problem with my onboard NIC. I noticed that iperf on the network between computers manages 1GB, but the internet connection when downloading makes only 8-10MB/s so probably 100Mbit. Have installed another NIC via PCI and the download goes to 1GB and I have 30MB/s. The driver for the onboard NIC is the tg3.

[23:51:47] <CaTaCaS> I tried it with Ubuntu 20.04 and 14.04 as live boot, but no success. I have not tested with Windows yet
[23:51:59] *** Joins: pjfry4 (pjfry@gateway/vpn/protonvpn/pjfry)
[23:52:03] <rcf> I would suggest trying with Windows. Or one of the BSDs even. 
[23:52:21] *** Joins: duxsco (~Thunderbi@user/duxsco)
[23:53:20] <rcf> My suspicion is still weird timing interactions or corruptions that muck with TCP when going through your router to the rest of the Internet. 
[23:54:11] <CaTaCaS> ok, I had that idea too. Only I had to empty a HDD and install Windows for that :)
[23:54:22] <rcf> If you could show that it works fine on Windows or BSD, you could perhaps report this to the kernel driver people. 
[23:55:06] <rcf> Definitely an odd issue. 
[23:56:28] <CaTaCaS> If it is the TCP, why does it work with another NIC. Or is it technically possible?

[23:57:52] <rcf> CaTaCaS: the algorithms used by TCP to ensure its reliability in varying network conditions might be impacted in subtle ways by lower-level issues. 
[23:57:55] <kubast2> Anyone noticed that settings set during arch-chroot by timedatectl don't show up once rebooting? I am pretty sure I have executed the timedatectl within the chroot
[23:58:19] <CaTaCaS> I borrowed the other PCI NIC from my friend and have to return it tomorrow :(
[23:58:20] <kubast2> I always find myself having to set the set-ntp and set-timezone settings after the initial reboot
