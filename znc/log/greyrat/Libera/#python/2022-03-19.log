[00:16:57] <Pi-sistance> Hey, is my reason for thinking the odeint function wont accept np.cos(x) correct? I think its becasue the numpy version of the function is only coded to be a function of x, and even though in this case the y inppput doesnt do anything, the odeint still requires me to specify that y is also a domain. Easiest correction is to use a lambda function.
[00:18:16] <SnoopJ> teut, as I said, it's done exactly the way you'd do it in any calculus course: you "just" take the derivatives.
[00:18:30] <SnoopJ> d/da (a*b) = b,  d/db (a*b) = a
[00:18:38] <teut> ya , its written use chain rule
[00:18:42] <zerosum> Repiphany, that worked but not as I want it.. it only writes a single entry for each of the key and I have multiple for each unique key, not sure I'm explaining it correctly here is my result: https://bpa.st/MFBA

[00:24:28] <SnoopJ> Pi-sistance, odeint expects a function of the form f(y, t, ...) as its doc describes, if that answers your question.

[00:25:04] <Pi-sistance> Repiphany it doesnt seem necessary for the question. youre either familiar with differential equation function or not? I think that numpy's odeint function is coded to always have both x and y inputs for ITs function input, and single variable functions arent coded that way

[00:25:17] <Pi-sistance> ok thanks snoopj ill check that
[00:25:34] <SnoopJ> Pi-sistance, numpy does not define anything named odeint(), it's in scipy.integrate
[00:25:42] <Repiphany> The way you asked the question might be entirely irrelevant to how you're trying to do whatever in code

[02:27:00] <bjs> nedbat: well `while` takes a condition, and the `else` is syntactically attached to it exactly like `if condition ... else ...` but the else has no relation to that condition
[02:27:26] <nedbat> bjs: i see, so the similarity between if and while makes the else more confusing.  I can understand that.

[05:43:00] <ldericher> Hey, I got the timestamp `1647657219`, how can I check if that's in the past? `datetime.fromtimestamp` result looks promising, but I'm not sure about just subtracting
[05:43:19] <ldericher> Maybe it's advisable to use `timedelta`? How?
[05:44:41] <InPhase> datetime.datetime.fromtimestamp(1647657219) gives the date from it, as a start.
[05:45:34] <achilleas> ldericher: datetime.now() - ... ?
[05:45:42] <InPhase> You can diff that with datetime.datetime.now() and use .total_seconds() as one method.

[07:05:52] <klu> you can use importlib.reload to reload changes in a module.
[07:07:04] <SnoopJ> Andrew, "script" is a little nebulous but you'd probably want to write your server with a core and then components that can be hot-reloaded without dropping connections/etc. (which would be held by the core). Sopel is a good example of this, albeit on the client side of the protocol.
[07:07:24] <matsaman> Andrew: I mean it's bad if there is some negative consequence
[07:07:32] <Andrew> I think that sounds right :)
[07:08:26] <SnoopJ> importlib.reload can be useful, although it does have a few sharp edges you have to be mindful of (but the documentation mentions most of them, AFAIK)

[13:15:30] <stdInOut> hello, in two different build installations, I get the same 'ImportError: No module named...' error in both, one for pkg_resources, and now the other for numpy. the latter even has the environment parameters set as system-wide (even though this likely wouldn't be a requirement for finding the package).  I dont see why the packages cant be found.
[13:16:08] <ChrisWarrick> stdInOut: what’s a build installation? what environment parameters are set?
[13:16:54] <stdInOut> ChrisWarrick, a build installation is installing from script, like 'python3 setup.py build'
[13:17:07] <ChrisWarrick> stdInOut: don’t use `setup.py`
[13:17:23] <stdInOut> oh, one sec please
[13:17:28] <ChrisWarrick> stdInOut: to install a package in the current directory, use `pip install .`
[13:17:38] <ChrisWarrick> (you don’t need `build` at all)
[13:18:37] <stdInOut> ChrisWarrick, but it is not a package from python3 library. it is the git bundle of a web application
[13:18:48] <ChrisWarrick> stdInOut: that doesn’t matter
[13:19:05] <stdInOut> oh, ok

[16:30:27] <jinsun__> so you need one function for map and another function for filter, can't do it together in one function
[16:30:34] <asa22> ok
[16:30:57] <jim> asa22, one way to start, is to receive the list (or list of lists, or whatever), and print each of them
[16:31:08] <jim> how can you do that?
[16:31:43] <jinsun__> so the (type(num) == int) and (num > 0) part will go in one function that you supply to filter and num * num part will go into another function that you give to map
[16:31:59] <jim> say you just have a list [1,2,3,4]

How could I make it so that import1.py can be run by itself with the conditions that it only runs X code if *not* executed from the parent program.py; and if it *was* called by program.py then do *other* code. What would this be called if it makes any sense to anyone? Any

[21:47:45] <SnoopJ> greentree, here's the first result for "schedule windows" on PyPI, it appears to be OS independent: https://schedule.readthedocs.io/en/stable/
[21:48:15] <greentree> i've been using this library and it does run things on a schedule
[21:48:26] <greentree> i was more curious if it'd be possible to make a task more daemon-like
[21:48:32] <SnoopJ> meaning what?
[21:50:00] <greentree> eh, maybe odd choice of words there but i really just want to specify a cron syntax and run a program
[21:50:08] <greentree> this schedule library expects me to pass in a function directly in code
[21:50:25] <greentree> the closest thing ive seen that does what i want is python-crontab but im not sure if itll work on windows correctly

[23:53:38] <solrize> KirkMcDonald, i don't care about cgi scaling horribly since 1) i only use it for very low traffic services, and 2) if it scales horribly because of python's slow startup, then the right fix is speed up the startup.  i'm told that amazon.com started as cgi scripts.  my tiny hetzner vps can fork a linux process 10,000 times a second so forking isn't the bottleneck.  jinsun_hmm thanks.  if i can pip install cgi then that helps

[23:55:40] <grym> you can absolutely install requests in python 2.5
[23:55:41] <jinsun__> you still have till 3.13, so 2.5 years more, to convert your code to wsgi or something better supported

[23:57:32] <KirkMcDonald> solrize: The forking isn't the problem. It would be entirely possible to design a server that forks on each request while performing something close to adequately. The problem is starting a new interpreter and importing all of your dependencies on each request.

[23:58:31] <solrize> KirkMcDonald, right, that should be seen as a fixable python bug.  fixing it would help lots of slow starting python applications like calibre too
[23:58:46] <solrize> opening db connection is fast, and is only an issue if you use a remote db
[23:58:51] <KirkMcDonald> solrize: It's pretty well inherent to Python's design.
