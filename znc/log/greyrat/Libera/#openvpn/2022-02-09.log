[02:34:32] <splud> config newbie here - is it possible for a client connecting to one openvpn host (in this case, 2.4.11) to be redirected to another, say via client config?

[02:36:24] <rob0> um, not really, what exactly are you trying to accomplish?
[02:38:42] <BtbN> Maybe at the iptables level, but your abilities to match specific clients is rather limits there
[02:38:53] <BtbN> And all traffic will still go via the original server

[02:59:05] <splud> yea, was thinking akin to an HTTP-like "moved permanently" response that could cause the client to reconnect to specified server.
[02:59:20] <splud> "oh, you're one of THOSE users, go over THERE."
[02:59:54] <splud> In this particular application, alpha and beta systems we want to direct to a different host.

[03:04:51] <rob0> I'm still trying to understand, but I think no, your idea won't work.
[03:05:28] <rob0> You want all clients to try to connect to a single server, but then send some of those clients to a different one?

If it's not something openVPN can do, it's not something it can do.  Was just hoping, because that'd be a reasonably clean server side management.

[10:12:51] <rob0> openvpn won't do http redirection.  However, if you used TCP (not generally recommended) port sharing with a proxy on 443, and if openvpn knew which clients to accept, the others could be redirected by the proxy to another TCP openvpn elsewhere.
[10:13:29] <rob0> well, maybe, maybe not.
[10:14:34] <rob0> Two problems there: how would openvpn know, without accepting the connection, which clients needed to be passed through to the proxy?
[10:15:11] <rob0> Second, the client won't know how to deal with being redirected.
[10:16:38] <rob0> Yep, not something openvpn can do.  Probably have to use different DNS names for clients that need to go elsewhere.

[17:22:35] <splud> rob0 - wasn't expecting openvpn to do _http_ redirects,  was questioning whether within the openvpn framework, it would be possible to direct a connection to another VPN host, just drawing a functional parallel to the HTTP response.  I'm not at all familiar with the limits of the VPN implementation.
[17:23:48] <rob0> yeah, no, that is not a feature.
[17:24:20] <splud> Working with a fleet of devices that connect to a specific host, and thinking it would be very handy if they could be selectively directed to different ones, at the server side.  like "hi, your cert passes muster, but go talk to this other host."
[17:25:21] <splud> and that was communicated yesterday.  Just clarifying that the HTTP reference was merely for an exampe of a post-connection redirect functionality, not HTTPspecifically.
[17:26:24] <splud> Presently, we reconfigure the devices directly to use a different host, but they need to first be upgraded to do that.  And they upgrade over the VPN. <g>
[17:28:09] <ordex> splud: nope, that is not possible. it would also be a little concern for the user because the server could decide to reirect you somewhere that the user does not know (might be wanted in an enterprise setup)
[17:29:30] <splud> ordex - I've repeatedly acknowledged that it isn't possible,.  Got it.
[17:29:33] <splud> thank you.
[17:29:44] <ordex> ah sorry :)
[17:30:07] <splud> there were continued replies hours after my last comment last night, was responding to those.
[17:30:52] <splud> these aren't cognitive users anyway, they're a fleet of ~1M devices.
