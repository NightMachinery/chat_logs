[02:42:07] <rdrg109> TIL When two yasnippet snippets are triggered with the same key, yasnippet will prompt you which one you want to expand and the name of each snippet is shown in the completion list. This means that you can group snippets by assigning them the same key. For example, I have assigned "at" as the key to all my SQL statements that involves using "ALTER TABLE".

[10:06:39] <teknikal_domain> I could be completely wrong though
[10:07:06] <johnjay> yes it is special. windows intercepts it to do various things.
[10:07:12] <johnjay> e.g. win+R opens the run dialog box
[10:07:17] <Aurora_v_kosmose> You can also use pedals and mess with libevdev to intercept and remap presses.
[10:07:27] <johnjay> you can remap the menu key to Hyper, that works easily.
[10:07:28] <johnjay> http://ergoemacs.org/emacs/emacs_hyper_super_keys.html
[10:08:12] <johnjay> beaky: to answer your question, to get hyper on windows i haven't tried it. but i believe you need to use Autohotkey if you want some keys to be hyper.
[10:08:30] <johnjay> for example you could redefine the win key as 'a' and then make 'a' be hyper

[10:16:33] <teknikal_domain> Okay, now I'm doing some digging
[10:16:54] <teknikal_domain> is there a way to get emacs to not read `init.el` on startup, to cause it to load in a completely stock configuration?
[10:17:07] <johnjay> yes, emacs -q
[10:17:34] <teknikal_domain> My stock emacs has some weird behavior then
[10:18:00] <teknikal_domain> the menu key (right side of the space bar) drops to an immediate `M-x`, I can't even probe it with `C-h k`

[20:29:01] <dminuoso> Walex: With `i, a[i] := a[1], i` we have to talk about semantics here. Should a parallel multiple assignment be atomic with respect to the abstract semantics of the language?
[20:29:40] <dminuoso> (where "of the language" means "your abstract language")
[20:30:07] <Walex> dminuoso: that swaps the values of 'i' and 'a[i]', and requires a temporary also for '&a[i]'...

[20:36:50] <Walex> 4) it turns out that the generates sequences of code from the more complicated cases of "parallel" multiple assignment are hard to understand because they are 'progn's of single 'setq's, and while they imply the original "parallel" multiple assignment, that is really quite hard to see. Most "hard to reason about"/"hard to prove correct" sequences of single assignments are actually manual expansions of a 
[20:36:56] <Walex> "parallel" multiple assingment.
[20:37:31] <johnjay> is there a cleaner way to mix "or" and "when" together?
[20:37:36] <dminuoso> Yes, and I wholeheartedly agree - though my rationale is founded in different reasons.
[20:37:45] <johnjay> i have code similar to (or (when COND 1) 2)
[20:38:07] <johnjay> i guess i should just make it an if-then but still
[20:38:24] <dminuoso> For some reason I cant quite make out yet, you seem to be focused a lot on "parallel" multiple assignment. Let me try and rephrase that how I see it, and see if those two are compatible/equivalent

[20:43:42] <dminuoso> Your argument seems to be quite similar, in that say `progn` in `(progn <here goes many setqs>)` is redundant and a distraction from what's really important. Rather than letting the implementation parallelize, you pick some (inefficient) order and demand the implementation do it lik ehtat.
[20:44:13] <dminuoso> Though it's not entirely the same, if for no other reason than mutating stores usually has observable effects on the abstract machine.
[20:45:05] * Walex keeps reading and will comment later
[20:45:36] <dminuoso> But in spirit you seem to advertise for "writing code without specifying an order" whenever the semantics wouldn't be changed, which tends to improve code reasoning for the same reason that purity allows for equational reasoning.

[21:22:45] <Walex> ah as to what Dijstra pointed out: that tail recursion involves a relationship between predicate transformers, while looping involves only a relationship between predicates, so it is a whole level of abstraction simpler.

[21:27:11] <dminuoso> It isnt what I meant at all, but the coincidence is amusing indeed.
