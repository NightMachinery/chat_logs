[02:27:28] <neoweb> git push origin production2021 -f
[02:28:25] <neoweb> i cloned a repo
[02:28:28] <jinsun> famous last words :D
[02:28:29] <neoweb> switch branches
[02:28:44] <rawtaz> so, the first thing i'd like to tell you is that you should be picky about where you place the arguments. the format if you check `git help push` isnt to put the flag -f at the end. one day not being proper with syntax will bite you in the ass
[02:28:49] <neoweb> but when i switched branches...and I think I forgot this, I need to pull...
[02:29:35] <neoweb> the entire action i was doing, was trying to delete one file from a git repo, and it was giving me trouble, so I thought the error message was complaining about that
[02:29:44] <neoweb> thanks rawtaz
[02:30:29] <rawtaz> you switched to that production2021 branch i take it? so you were locally on that?
[02:31:22] <rawtaz> neoweb: dont worry about having hit the fan, shit happens. at least you managed to correct it in the end, as i understand it?
[02:31:38] <rawtaz> now you know about reflog so you can check that and foremost you can ask here as well if you get stuck sometime again :)
[02:33:06] <neoweb> well i did but it might be nice to know how to go back
[02:33:13] <neoweb> i think this is the folder i was in when i pushed

[02:37:26] <rawtaz> if on that branch after you added the commit, you push to origin, then git will try to send that new commit to the origin. if the origin hasnt changed at all since you cloned the repo, it should be successful. but if the origin branch hasnt got the same commit history as your local clone anymore, then the push will probably fail

[02:38:29] <neoweb> i am pulling a branch, but it is giving me from when I first branched it
[02:38:32] <rawtaz> if you do want to update that local branch of yours to have what is in the remote, you can do `git fetch origin` and then `git merge --ff-only origin/production2021` to make git fast-forward the commit history on your local branch to where it is on the origin production2021 branch
[02:38:33] <neoweb> check out
[02:38:34] <neoweb> due
[02:38:38] <neoweb> dammit
[02:38:50] <rawtaz> you do that with fetch and then merge
[02:38:52] <neoweb> i created a new branch locally i think instead of cehcking out
[02:38:54] <neoweb> dammit
[02:39:09] <rawtaz> some people use pull which is those two in one go, but i recommend against that because it's more magic and you get less control if you dont know what youre doing.
[02:39:14] <rawtaz> oh ok
[02:39:54] <neoweb> dude
[02:39:55] <neoweb> dammit
[02:39:57] <neoweb> that is what i was doing heh

[02:40:28] <neoweb> i thought i was switching to the branch when i typed in git branch branchname
[02:40:34] <rawtaz> oh ok, got it
[02:40:39] <neoweb> so i was cloning, git branch
[02:40:44] <neoweb> and missed the git checkout branch
[02:41:03] <rawtaz> if oyu did that on master then your new branch there should have gotten the commit that master was on as the tip of it
[02:41:43] <neoweb> what is wrong with git pull
[02:42:26] <neoweb> ahh ic
[02:43:35] <neoweb> man, that is so crazy, i guess i get the power of the force command now, but damn did I never think since the way git tracks changes through additions, that I would be able to erase stuff so easily
[02:44:25] <rawtaz> now you know. i mean when you force you're telling git to completely ignore whatever is on the other end and just overwrite it
[02:44:32] <neoweb> yeh
[02:44:32] <rawtaz> why else would you need to use force?

[02:46:40] <neoweb> i guess it is time to link in some git backup stuff

[02:47:58] <neoweb> i can check

[02:53:39] <ZacSharp> the reflog is per repo, what you need is the remote reflog on github (which doesn't seem to exist)

[03:01:07] <neoweb> so crazy heh
[03:01:22] <neoweb> so i guess i erased the log
[03:01:30] <neoweb> what is the diff between log, and reflog
[03:01:34] <ZacSharp> no you did not
[03:01:56] <ZacSharp> git log shows the commit history leading to a specific commit
[03:02:12] <ZacSharp> git reflog shows the latest few commits a reference pointed to
[03:03:08] <rawtaz> neoweb: please slow down a bit and also do read some of the documentation. it will be beneficial for you in the long run
[03:03:47] <ZacSharp> this tool should be capable of formatting the github api answer in a readable format https://github.com/criswell/github-reflog
[03:03:55] <ZacSharp> haven't tried it though

[21:11:03] <PenguinMan98> Can you run command line commands inside the gulp task?
[21:11:25] <ikke> But it cannot distingiush between things changed by the build process or uncommitted changes that were there before
[21:11:34] <ikke> PenguinMan98: I have no idea
[21:12:22] <PenguinMan98> It seems to me the easiest way would be to checksum a certain directory before and after the build process and continue only if they match
[21:12:36] <PenguinMan98> I just don't know how to do that. LOL
[21:13:08] <PenguinMan98> Well, not from within a gulp task anyway
[21:13:25] <eschwartz> if it's a pre-commit hook then you could blindly assume no one has unstaged changes while making a commit, and just check for any changes to tracked files
[21:13:45] <ikke> eschwartz: why?
[21:13:56] <eschwartz> The larger meta-problem here is build systems that allow modifying source files at all
[21:14:04] <ikke> Not everyone is using git add -a / git commit -a
[21:14:11] <eschwartz> ikke: it's not the wisest assumption, indeed
[21:14:22] <eschwartz> hence "blindly"
[21:14:39] <eschwartz> I'm not entirely sure the objective is possible at all, otherwise?

[21:18:05] <eschwartz> PenguinMan98: if you run `export GIT_INDEX_FILE=.git/tmp-index; git add .;` inside the pre-commit hook it will use a temp index and then git diff --quiet will report only the differences caused by gulp

[21:36:34] <dev4449> I have an existing project I've been working on for one month. It's a react project. Is it correct to start using git for it now that I'm actually at the middle of it?
[21:37:23] <eschwartz> you can start using git for it at any time, but you probably cannot retroactively get a history of changes you made for the last month
[21:37:58] <dev4449> eschwartz: Okay
[21:38:07] <eschwartz> still, you can start using git now, and any future changes will have a trackable history :)
[21:38:52] <eschwartz> if you do have, like, tarballs of different versions from the past month, you can technically import those too
