[03:22:30] <zebrag> I want to use backtick for code and verbatim. Everyone else in the world is doing that (even the emacs manual). And I don't want to live in a sort of parallel world for weirdos. So I'm searching, and I stumbled on, well, weird comments that I prefer not to quote because I don't want to start an argument. But I really could use the "common language" backticks for code and verbatim. So far I've only redefined `org-emphasis-alist`. But I don't understand the why of

[05:40:07] <irontom> I'm using ERC to connect to libera on an laptop running openBSD 7.0. I just set up a vpn using mullvad and wireguard. Prior to using the vpn, I was able to connect to libera without any issues. When the vpn is running (interface wg0), I get an error message of "error from irc.libera.chat:...". The ERC config I'm suing is based on the SASL section of the libera site and is current working a linux machine I have running the same vpn. If I
[05:40:07] <irontom> shut down the vpn on the openBSD machine, I can connect to libera again. Are there any openBSD-specific settings I need in my congfig.el to make this work?

[07:24:27] <zebrag> Awesome: I open files where I've already made use of `backtick` since I was expecting it could work in some future, and there is it, the expressions are highlighted as if they were flanked with the unusual to the eye "~". Well, there is a difference, with `visual-fill-column`, or sth, it seems the line break is constrained when using "~", and this constraint is lessened when using "`". So the result isn't identical.

[08:43:04] <zebrag> When I replace ~ or = by "`", and that it is still highlighted through the hack above, and that I use `visual-fill-column` mode, and the wrap is right before "`hello`", I have the end of the line right above, which really contains no char at all, highlighted too
[08:43:56] <zebrag> I have the same line break if I use =hello=, but w/o the "empty" end of the line highlighted

[08:55:32] <zebrag> It seems that for the highlighting part it behaves like ~. But not like =. Since they do not have ~ and =, the same "value" in the eyes of org-mode, maybe it is where to look for the explanation.

[14:09:25] <bae> In R, you can define a function, and then use the name of the function to plot a graph of the function. Like this: line1=makeFun(2*x-7~x)

[14:13:45] <bae> line1 is the name of the function, makeFun is the "defun", and then plotFun takes the name of the function, the name of the parameter (~x) and then the domain along the x axis is 'xlim=range(-10,10)'. My question is about using gnuplot with elisp to do the same thing. How can I call gnuplot witout explicitly giving the definition of the function, but instead use a 'defun' definition in elisp?
[14:14:44] <bremner> gnuplot doesn't understand elisp afaik

[14:16:28] <bremner> I guess there might be some org-mode feature that uses gnuplot, is that what you are asking about?
[14:18:09] <bae> No, not really. I want to be able to go to ielm, define a mathematical function in elisp, and then be able to graph the function as defined in elisp by calling gnuplot.
[14:19:05] <bae> bremner: calc can do something like this, right?
[14:20:16] <bae> I know it can plot vectors, but I don't know about functions. But I want to do it within the context of elisp, without having to go to calc.

[14:21:35] <bremner> it sounds unlikely to be possible to me, but I've been wrong before
[14:21:54] <bremner> perhaps you would like the racket plot module, via racket-mode in emacs
[14:22:11] <bremner> it's not elisp, but it is a lisp.

[20:00:18] <grtcdr> Thanks for the recommendation, but I'm making a literal dotfiles repository. So I need the output in Markdown.
[20:01:44] <wasamasa> you could create your own org backend based on the markdown one
[20:01:46] <sm> use pandoc ?

[20:04:18] <grtcdr> I don't have a website, I'm trying to have the output be Markdown so I can display it through my git repository.

[20:05:23] <corwin> Generally speaking, I think of HTML is the only "native web language".  If you want to create web pages with links and such eventually you are creating HTML.  If you use MD or some intermediate format you are simply delegating the work for transforming from the intermediate language to HTML to some other component (and thus giving up control of the generation of the HTML).

[20:06:33] <grtcdr> corwin: Exactly.

[20:08:08] <grtcdr> I hope to do that in the future. :)
[20:08:22] <corwin> The other option that I think works pretty well is to make your MD very simple by excluding anything that your MD to HTML conversion doesn't render to your satisfaction.
[20:08:40] <sm> pandoc gives fine control over the generated MD, which is useful
[20:08:45] <grtcdr> corwin: Seems like image likes are one of them.

[20:09:42] <grtcdr> Thank you all for the help!
[20:09:51] <corwin> it's not the MD generation that is the issue, because org will give fine control to generate MD. The issue is the MD to HTML which is limited in terms of what can be done also also generally not something we can control (since it's implementation is built into whatever forge).

[20:11:21] <corwin> Anyway, when I need to make MD for a forge to generate HTML from I usually create the MD automatically from a git commit hook.  I have some "sample code" here: https://git.sr.ht/~mplscorwin/org-git-hooks

[20:58:17] <wasamasa> surprisingly enough, elisp isn't a general purpose programming language and heavily leaning towards text editor things
[20:58:35] <wasamasa> I wouldn't use it for that task, simply because its approach to file IO sucks
[20:58:48] <wasamasa> but perhaps you can shell out to some program doing all the work

[22:39:49] <_73> How can I create a macro that uses the last kbd macro that I created? Currently I get an error if I call `call-last-kbd-macro` when defining a kbd macro. I understand that I could name the kbd macro and then call it but that isn't as nice a solution.

[22:40:29] <_73> If this were possible then I could create kbd macros incrementally by chaining them together over and over.
[22:41:07] <corwin> AFAIK that's the solution. I think calling the last kbd macro uses some internal vars that are stomped on when we start defining a new kbd macro.

[22:54:40] <corwin> But since most elisp can be loaded as dynamic libs now having Emacs start with all our byte-compiled sources already "baked in" to the executable is maybe less relevant?
