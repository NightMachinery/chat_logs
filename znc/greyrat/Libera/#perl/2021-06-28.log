Their build config won't work on anything prior to 5.28 because those Perls were built using an older MinGW.

[06:00:55] <xenu> and 32-bit builds too
[06:01:08] <xenu> but i wonder if there will be backlash
[06:01:41] <genio> Part of what I'm doing is going to be to create a comprehensive howto so mostly anyone can make builds. I'm running through everything in the StrawberryPerl github org now to see what all's necessary before I start documenting. 
[06:01:48] <xenu> btw there was a guy on p5p recently who said that xp is *the only* OS he has access to
[06:01:51] <xenu> how is that even possible
[06:02:26] <genio> he also noted the *HUGE* problem with that. he can't get a modern browser.  None of the web works.
[06:02:51] <genio> which, in my opinion, is how it should be. XP shouldn't be allowed on any network
[06:05:12] <xenu> i'm seriously curious *why* he ended up with a setup like that
[06:05:37] <xenu> win10 works on 15 years old hardware, although without sdd it may be a little bit slow
[06:05:41] <xenu> there's also linux, which is free

[18:55:21] <simcop2387> Since I have to setup a full brand new VPS anyway any recommendations for services? had been using linode for years but want to look at what options exist.  I'm likely to keep perlbot itself (or at least the evalserver) running on my local server just because of size requirements and such so probably not need gobs of ram remotely.  say 4gb with 20-40gb of storage?
[18:55:53] <simcop2387> basically end up running a VPN, web server, and some docker containers.

[21:39:13] <simcop2387> there's a db_schema in there that's been the biggest part of the plans for how the bot side of things should work.

[21:41:56] <simcop2387> much of it is being designed to treat the DB as immutable and with constraints and triggers setup to enforce that.

[22:43:57] <thowe> Is there a handy built-in way for a root account to query another user's perlbrew to get the path of the user's current perl executable?
[22:44:43] <thowe> I'm trying to figure out the best way for root to execute perl using a user's perlbrew env.
[22:45:16] <Grinnz> i mean, the easiest way is to actually load that user's env, as that user
[22:45:45] <Grinnz> sudo su - username -c 'which perl'
[22:45:52] <Grinnz> well without the sudo for root :P
[22:48:14] <Grinnz> for longer term solutions, i would recommend 1. depending on a specific full path to a perl where possible, 2. maybe consider alternatives to perlbrew if you need to access the perl from multiple users

[22:49:49] <OnlineCop> I'm trying to justify a change to PCRE/PCRE2 subroutines, based on how perl handles verbs within them. Did PCRE first introduce subroutines? (According to https://bugs.exim.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2725#c2: "...Subroutine calls appeared in PCRE before they did in Perl...")

[22:49:56] <thowe> I plan to start a Mojo app under that user at system startup.  I was going to use Daemon::Control, which will run as the user if asked, and I am wondering if that uses su, which uses a users shell env be default, I think

[22:59:45] <Grinnz> running as the user won't change that you should use full paths to everything so as not to rely on env changes
[23:00:06] <Grinnz> so it doesn't much matter which way you do that
