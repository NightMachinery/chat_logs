[00:08:46] <cakeroll> hey. i'm trying to compare two instances of the same model (gpt2) trained on two different data sets (say, text from different authors). one of the datasets, however, is an order of magnitude larger (~20m) than the other (~2m). so now i'm wondering: should i downsample the larger one to make them more comparable? it makes sense to me, but on the
[00:08:47] <cakeroll> other hand, using more data should result in a model with better representations, so i should use as much as possible, even if it's imbalanced. any tips? maybe someone even knows work that looks into this?

While IG has many desirable properties, when applied to visual models, the method often produces spurious/noisy pixel attributions in regions that are not related to the predicted class.

[14:06:10] <cakeroll> hey. i'm trying to compare two instances of the same model (gpt2) trained on two different data sets (say, text from different authors). one of the datasets, however, is an order of magnitude larger (~20m) than the other (~2m). so now i'm wondering: should i downsample the larger one to make them more comparable? it makes sense to me, but on the
[14:06:10] <cakeroll> other hand, using more data should result in a model with better representations, so i should use as much as possible, even if it's imbalanced. any tips? maybe someone even knows work that looks into this?
