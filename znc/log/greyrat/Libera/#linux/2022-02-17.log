[06:10:59] <lockywolf> basically, horribly obsolete
[06:11:13] <lockywolf> irssi is console-only, so basically horribly obsolete

[06:11:24] <Dagmar> Being console-only doesn't make it obsolete

[06:12:07] <lockywolf> but it's crap
[06:12:19] <znf> that's literally the only thing that annoys me about hexchat's gtk2 support
[06:12:25] <znf> the lack of colored fonts support

[06:14:28] <znf> I'm pretty sure xchat has been "dead" for years?

[06:15:36] <CaesarNaykid> mIRC seems dookie tho
[06:15:41] <znf> Xchat (which hexchat is forked from) was the one that did commercial builds for Windows
[06:15:42] <lockywolf> rascul, xchat is hexchat
[06:15:48] <rascul> lockywolf no, it's not
[06:15:51] <znf> no, hexchat is forked...
[06:16:09] <lockywolf> rascul, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HexChat
[06:16:17] <znf> xchat has been dead since.. 2010
[06:16:18] <lockywolf> HexChat is an Internet Relay Chat client that forked from XChat.
[06:16:19] <rascul> znf i guess i figured hexchat kept up the same paid windows binary release that xchat did
[06:16:20] <CaesarNaykid> oh my trading platform does support debian i didn't think it does

[06:18:38] <CaesarNaykid> or, distros i guess its called

[06:29:03] <Dagmar> It's not a thing you have to question
[06:29:05] <rascul> CaesarNaykid they will be owned by the user who created them, the user who created them is the user the rsync command runs as, which is the user that owns the crontab

[06:29:55] <rascul> why?
[06:30:02] <CaesarNaykid> to look

[06:31:09] <Dagmar> No, root has a crontab, it's just empty

[06:31:49] <CaesarNaykid> "no crontab for root"
[06:31:50] <rascul> note that root's crontab is not the one in /etc ;)
[06:31:50] <Dagmar> FOr root-level cron jobs, you need to look in /etc/crontab, and probably /etc/cron.(daily|weekly)
[06:31:57] <CaesarNaykid> when i typed crontab -l
[06:31:58] <CaesarNaykid> as root
[06:32:02] <Dagmar> The format for _those_ is _slightly_ different

[07:08:06] <Dagmar> CaesarNaykid: yeah if you really need to spin up new virtuals in a white-hot hurry, cloning virtual disks with dd is generally the easiest route
[07:08:22] <rascul> i've been learning linux for almost 30 years now and i'm almost to newbie level
[07:08:23] <Dagmar> For some distros you've got to diddle a machine-id file before the first boot and that's about it

[07:08:47] <Dagmar> CaesarNaykid: That's because there is no such thing as a "good" Windows neighborhood.
[07:08:51] <Dagmar> THey're all ghettos.
[07:08:59] <rascul> mine was a trailer park
[07:09:04] <CaesarNaykid> so, i built a core i3 system and installed ubuntu
[07:09:20] <CaesarNaykid> that is now my home file server
[07:09:31] <CaesarNaykid> that's probably configured worse than the other one i been asking yall about haha
[07:09:41] <CaesarNaykid> just not as complex
[07:09:51] <Dagmar> The most reliable way to get those to behave once there's more than about 10 windows machines involved is to set up a Samba server and force it to win every browser election
[07:10:12] <CaesarNaykid> yeah i'm using samba

[09:12:22] <kj7rrv> So if I write a program that uses tun and attempts to get the bytes the kernel gives it to the other node, but doesn't guarantee it, will the rest of the networking stack handle the lost frames?
[09:12:47] <domicron> Dagmar, I suspect it came from a worse generator - like AWS portal. I agree, telling them to use ssh-keygen seems like the most sensible thing. But whats wrong with securecrt?
[09:12:48] <Dagmar> Not unless you're doing it over a tcp tunnel

[09:14:07] <domicron> or securefx
[09:14:31] <Dagmar> kj7rrv: Well, there's also some business with it keeping a buffer window around so that it can deal with resending lost packets, along with being able to indicate to the program that it's too full to take more right now

[09:16:21] <Dagmar> kj7rrv: The data link layer doesn't much care if the packets get there.  THat's not the "reliability" it's worrying about.  It's trying to avoid the packets being _mangled_

[21:37:29] <Dagmar> The sad thing is some people won't know enough to know that firejail will not help one bit
[21:37:34] <hexnewbie> On Wayland it just has to ask the desktop portal first, let the user accept (as they always do), and get to the same result
