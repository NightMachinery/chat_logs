[01:20:15] <patchvonbraun[m]> A pretty sunset with radio telescopes...
[01:22:42] <jogn_1[m]> beautiful sunset
[01:23:21] <patchvonbraun[m]> It's amazing how good security-cams are these days.
[01:24:34] <jogn_1[m]> Dam I couldn't even tell it was a security camera until you mentioned it
[01:24:46] <jogn_1[m]> What is that, ring camera?
[01:25:06] *** Quits: pcero (~pcero@187.135.224.23) (Quit: Konversation terminated!)
[01:25:25] <patchvonbraun[m]> Just a wide-angle lense on the camera.  Hence the spheroidal distortion.  
[01:25:31] <jogn_1[m]> Oh ðŸ˜‚
[01:26:14] <patchvonbraun[m]> But the sensitivity is pretty amazing on these things.    It'll switch to night mode soon, and turn on its IR illuminator.

[14:43:10] <mk[m]12> If I modify and save the file that contains the work function is it enough?
[14:47:00] <Notou[m]> You would need to do a make install to push the new version where the lib is installed
[14:50:48] <mk[m]12> thanks for the answer, so if I understand correctly after the modification I have to do:
[14:50:48] <mk[m]12> cmake ../
[14:50:48] <mk[m]12> make
[14:50:48] <mk[m]12> sudo make install
[15:04:29] <mk[m]12> is it right ?
