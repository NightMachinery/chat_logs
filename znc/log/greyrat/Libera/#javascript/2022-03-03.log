[00:15:06] <jaawerth> Sayona: if you do like $('#your-form-id').serialize() it should use thee name field to build up the kind of structure PHP wants. But it it looks like you're trying tom anually give each item an index like images[0] hardcoded in the name - you shouldn't have to do that, since multiple form inputs with the same name will automatically given indices in the serialized name iirc

[00:23:32] <ljharb> rendar: focus is up to the user
[00:23:52] <ljharb> rendar: so, you could write code that on blur, refocuses, but that'd be a fast track to making the worst webpage ever
[00:24:03] <rendar> ljharb, i agree
[00:24:41] <rendar> ljharb, my problem is that i have this terminal line where the user types commands, which i want always focused also when the user select+copy text
[00:25:00] <rendar> but if there are other input boxes, then no of course, focus should go there
[00:25:01] *** Quits: daniel-k3 (~daniel-k@fsf/emeritus/daniel-k) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)

[08:02:48] <jaawerth> Rockwood: well the only thing you have out of the box on frontend for a session is the session id, which traditionally the backend will associate with an account via some kind of configured cache. For the frontend to have that info you would either include a header that sets it in a session cookie, have the frontend make an API call, or embed it somewhere, like in a data-attribute on an
[08:02:50] <jaawerth> element, etc. for this I'd probably just use a session cookie if you're using sessions

[15:08:25] <D4mned> when they do /quit they just end it there
[15:08:37] <D4mned> but when they get disconnected then it auto reconnects
[15:08:43] <D4mned> there must be a way
[15:08:58] <Decker> onexit() is a call in C process.something( "closeProcess?", ()=>{} );   in node to add a callback which can be called on a graceful exit.   https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15769514/window-onclose-function  window onclose can send something before diconnects happen

[15:09:23] <blueagain> s/can/enter

[15:20:23] <jaawerth> (though IIRC it does do a few things better than other browsers, but I forget what... I  think it's one of the few that actually implemented proper tail calls? though maybe not on mobile)
[15:20:49] <jaawerth> well... if the makers of IE don't even support it anymore, why should your company?
[15:21:05] <D4mned> can i like provoke an error event on a socket ?
[15:23:09] <Decker> send( undefined ) ?
[15:23:17] <ashnur> the question is not why we should support that is not supported, the question is, why should we support anything :) then apply that to individual browser individually.
[15:23:59] <jaawerth> ashnur: re focus, do you mean at all? I thought it could focus based on user interaction, it just didn't do it when you tried to do it from code.. or something like that. is there any indiraction between the tap and the focus or is it just native?

[15:27:04] <Decker> or did you move on to a differnt disconnect?
[15:27:26] <jaawerth> whereas if the seerver initiates the disconnect, you should get an 'end' event client-side. but also I would expect IRC to send.. some kind of custom signal to teh client as part of the protocol

[15:31:50] <D4mned> they all trigger these events
[15:31:54] <jaawerth> also you should have the client code do process.on('SIGTERM', ...) to have it invoke socket.destroy() and only invoke process.exit(0) after receiving the 'end' event (or sommething like that) so it tries to gracefully end the connection when teh client is killed (though -9 will stil do it aggressively). and also listen for SIGINT to prevent killing that way

[19:31:59] <eson123> idk but i am pretty sure the docs say a service worker doesn't support any access to the DOM
[19:32:04] <eson123> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API
[19:32:58] <eson123> but i know this is possible somehow, facebook does that, they use service worker and somehow makes a clickable notification that will open up facebook in a new tab
[19:34:53] <austincheney> eson123, from reading the documentation it looks like service workers are on an unrelated thread and have no access to the DOM.  So I guess they are just for message passing.
[19:35:11] <eson123> hm, i wonder how facebook does that then

[19:35:55] <austincheney> eson123, I use microservices via websockets for all my message passing, because then I do have DOM access
[19:36:31] <eson123> austincheney: hm i never tried microservices but do they still run in the background even tho the tab is closed ?
[19:36:38] *** Joins: crashrep (~crashrep@user/crashrep)
[19:38:19] <austincheney> eson123, websockets are bidirectional and fully asynchronous, but they have a major limitation.  They can only pass one message at a time per direction, so they are blocking to multiple simultaneous messages, for example attempting to send multiple messages from the same function
[19:38:39] <austincheney> websockets will not run when the tab is closed
[19:38:57] <Decker> I pass stacks of events no problem.

[19:39:04] <eson123> well yes i am aware of that, i was referring to microservices instead :P
[19:39:55] <austincheney> microservices just refers to a means of message handling, a code style.  They are not a technology standard.
[19:40:41] *** Quits: blacked51 (~blacked@user/blacked) (Client Quit)
[19:42:27] <austincheney> in my app I have a bunch of different actions to perform each requiring their own type of message, so handling that is a bunch of tiny services
[19:42:48] <austincheney> but I manage it through a single listener each on the server and client
[19:43:32] <austincheney> I do that by wrapping each service in an object like:  {"data":myServiceData,"service":"name_of_service"}
[19:44:09] <austincheney> then at each end I only need one listener and it dispatches the messaging to the appropriate service handler

[21:06:21] <apocalyptech> Hey all -- So in a little app of mine, I've got a tiny function which opens a popup window; slightly-altered source is here: https://gist.github.com/apocalyptech/486fccd969795fd7dc7015bc29dc0f58 (compressed some unnecessary details into a fictional `doStuff()` function)
[21:06:55] <apocalyptech> The app calls `jplayerAdd()` with a list of tracks -- if a player window doesn't already exist, it attempts to open one and then waits 1.5 secs before trying again, with a max of 3 tries

[21:28:49] <jaawerth> apocalyptech: in order to get the 3 windows, did you have to click through the prompmt for allowing the popups? since by default browsers typically block a popup that wasn't opened in response to a user action
[21:29:51] <jaawerth> if so, then by the time you've approved it, the code would have already gotten undefined/null back from window.open, since in this case it's a synchronous API and chooses not to block the ui thread in order to wait for approval (which would be bad)
[21:30:20] <apocalyptech> Yes, the popups are allowed by my browser (the *first* one always was; I explicitly allowed the others once this behavior started happening to me today)
[21:30:34] <jaawerth> lol well there goes that theory
[21:30:43] <apocalyptech> The call to `window.open` isn't returning null -- I'd checked for that via my console output.  Logs this: `JPlayer opened, window: [object Window]`
[21:31:06] <apocalyptech> `[object Window]` in that case would've been null, if that call was failing

[21:33:17] <apocalyptech> I suppose I should probably mock up a standalone example of this, outside that app itself.

[21:41:52] <jaawerth> anyway yeah I don't see anything in that code that woudl cause it. I *could* be missing something.. but I would suggest throwing a fiddle together (you don't need to use the real jplayer for the window contents, ofc, jus verifying the state of things and the log output would do). sometimes the act of creating an isolated executable example will even let you spot the bug before anyone else takes
[21:41:54] <jaawerth> a look!
[21:42:32] <apocalyptech> Well, bah, of course when I cut it all down and stick it on a public host, it works: https://apocalyptech.com/scratchpad/exo-debug/
[21:43:30] <jaawerth> that said, one change I would suggest making is instead of always referencing jplayerWindow and openAttempts via the closure, try passing them as args (you can pass extra args to setTimeout), and maybe get the newly opened jplayerwindows as a return value from jplayerOpen before setting it to replace the closure one that tracks state. those kind of floating vars via closure can lead to some

[22:13:14] <austincheney> On posix you just have to copy the cert files into the correct store.  I am using three stores depending on: darwin, fedora, or ubuntu
[22:13:35] <austincheney> then there is a command that imports the certs into the binary trust
[22:14:19] <austincheney> posix should be easy, but everything requires sudo.  That is easy to type from the terminal but a pain in Node especially if don't want to ask the user for the password unless its absolutely needed

[23:08:31] <banana_> ah ok newb here
[23:08:44] <banana_> yea so it prevents the app from crashing

[23:08:58] <banana_> or an async block
[23:09:21] <banana_> so registering that is like providing an error callback
[23:10:47] <Decker> it lets you log so you can find where you need to add a missing .catch; which can fix the result
[23:10:57] <banana_> I don't understand Promises and errors in JS 100%
[23:11:00] <austincheney> eXtr3m0, does the js have to be embedded in the xml document?
[23:11:13] <austincheney> eXtr3m0, if not this works well in the browser: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/384639/how-to-include-javascript-in-xml-document
[23:12:35] <banana_> Decker: yeah but doesnt the promise have to be rejected?
[23:12:44] *** Joins: c4017w__ (~c4017@209.52.68.8)
[23:12:59] <banana_> wouldnt a rejected promise with no error callback log in the console?
[23:13:24] <Decker> ya usually there's a default handler there already and it does a fine job
[23:14:14] <Decker> if the rejection is caught, it can return a different result, which wwill prevent the chain as a whole from being rejected even if steps along it were
[23:14:43] <Decker> but the unhandledRejection is after the whole chain crashes

[23:57:13] <austincheney> sheetjs, what kind of stream?  Is this a socket stream over a network?  Of a file stream from the file system?
[23:58:56] <sheetjs> in context, trying to write rows to a file.  Instead of having to twiddle thumbs for 10+ seconds, it would be nice to give feedback to the user as data is being written, but writing doesn't neatly map to "bytes" or "chunks"
[23:59:42] <sheetjs> a simple transform stream wouldn't be able to tell, without reparsing the data, how many rows have been written
