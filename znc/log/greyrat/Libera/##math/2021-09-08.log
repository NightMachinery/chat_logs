[04:47:57] <ESphynx> hi all, what's the root y (r) = e ^ (ln(r) / y) equivalence called?
[04:48:40] <somiaj> just an inverse relation, since e^(ln(r)) = r
[04:49:02] <somiaj> then r^k = (e^(ln(r)))^k = e^(ln(r) * k)
[04:49:48] <somiaj> I sometimes call this change of base, basically with exponetial functions, you can either look at things like r^k or things like r^(a * k), where a = ln(r)
[04:49:51] <somiaj> arg
[04:49:59] <somiaj> e^(a * k)
[04:50:51] *** Joins: DPA (~DPA@75-128-16-94.static.cable.fcom.ch)
[04:51:37] <ESphynx> well I guess,  root y (r) = r ^ (1/y) by definition right
[04:52:26] <somiaj> yes
[04:52:55] <ESphynx> so it's a change of "exponent base" (as opposed to a log base change)
[04:53:02] <somiaj> correct
[04:53:10] <ESphynx> cool, thank you.
[04:53:58] <somiaj> and in calculus, e is just a useful base, so exponetial growth is either a^t or e^(k t), and the later is just prefered for various reasons (one is the constant k has more physcail meaning than the constant a)

[04:58:47] <elderK> Hey all, I was wondering if I could pester someone, privately, for help on a question I have. It's a question I asked about on this channel a few days ago but I'm having trouble making any head-way on it and I'd like to make sure I'm not doing something stupid. I'd prefer to discuss it privately so that the conversation doesn't get interleaved with others. It regards firing a projectile at a moving target.
[04:59:14] <elderK> I believe I've figured out the solution to it but it's kind of a mismatch to help I was given a few days ago. That's partly why I want to discuss it once more.

[05:07:44] <cloudcell> ESphynx: what do you think about my finding?
[05:08:33] <cloudcell> curious, is it not?
[05:09:03] <ESphynx> cloudcell: didn't really read it all yet :) was just trying to figure out what you meant by GPT and realized it was not a partition table :)
[05:09:24] <ESphynx> and that there is GPT-3 already but Microsoft licensed it exclusively, though you can access it via an API :)
[05:10:10] <ESphynx> and then I went wth has OpenAI become ;)
[05:10:20] <cloudcell> True true
[05:10:38] <cloudcell> I'm not sure we need GPT-3
[05:10:54] <cloudcell> GPT-2 is enough for me
[05:11:16] <ESphynx> cloudcell: I'm just baffled... Elon's goal with OpenAI was to avoid AI turning against humanity and now it was turned over to MSFT? :S

[05:12:58] <cloudcell> register at my forum (on my website)
[05:12:58] <ESphynx> apparently GPT-3 is largely superior to GPT-2 alredy and close to being an AGI
[05:13:14] <cloudcell> I do not think so
[05:13:28] <cloudcell> GPT-2 is enough

[05:19:30] <biberao> nope
[05:20:08] <ESphynx> cloudcell: is there some AI-focused channels on Libera maybe?
[05:20:39] <cloudcell> there's #machinelearning
[05:20:44] <ESphynx> i'm a bit confused there about what you're asking GPT-2 and what is its response. Is there a simple input you can give it that gives you the value and/or explanation of Pi directly?
[05:21:03] <cloudcell> that's all the input
[05:21:07] <cloudcell> pure word commands
[05:21:13] <cloudcell> just read the description
[05:21:28] <ESphynx> for some reason AI researchers seems to think that deep learning is different from machine learning, though in reality it is a subset of the topic :)
[05:21:33] <cloudcell> if it does not work at once, simply feed it back to the terminal including the original text
[05:22:27] <ESphynx> cloudcell: even that ' Here's the answer:' isn't a reply from it?
[05:23:01] <cloudcell> check this out: "Pi = 3.14159265358979323846264338327950288419716939937510582097494459230781640628620899862803482534211706798214808651328230664709"

[05:24:26] <Z-module> and it's also published all over the place (to a zillion more digits)
[05:24:28] <cloudcell> as an input
[05:24:47] <Z-module> That program most likely simply has it built in.
[05:24:54] <Z-module> it's a commonly used constant
[05:24:57] <cloudcell> and why does it give 5 separate digits?
[05:24:57] <nagefire> I concur with Z-module
[05:25:02] <Z-module> 5 ?
[05:25:20] <cloudcell> 5 separate digits????
[05:25:29] <cloudcell> what are those other 4?
[05:25:35] <Z-module> You're not making any sense
[05:26:00] <cloudcell> sorry
[05:26:09] <cloudcell> I need someone to test this
[05:27:00] <Z-module> Test what?
[05:27:02] <cloudcell> I just want to get to the bottom of this. Does GPT-2 has a built in constant for PI or not?
[05:27:07] <Z-module> Of course it does
[05:27:13] <ESphynx> cloudcell: what I was asking is what is your input to GPT-2 and what is its answer ? it's not clear from your forum post
[05:27:25] <Z-module> (no idea what you mean by 5 separate digits)
[05:27:35] <nagefire> cloudcell if you can reformat your forum post please do, it's practically unreadable
[05:27:43] <cloudcell> Pi = 3.1415926535897932384626433832795028841971693993751058209749445923078164062862089986280348253421170679821480865132823066470938446095505822317253594081284811174502841027019385211296223875288109756659 332858223173055059631379522473794507820459111745026433832795028841971693993751058209749445923078164062862089986280348253421170679821480865132823066470938446095505822317253594081284811174502841027019385211296223875288109756659

[05:27:57] <Z-module> You know that pi has been calculated by machines to at least 50 trillion decimals, right? It's not remarkable any more.
[05:28:15] <ESphynx> Z-module: even if it would have a built-in Pi value, it wouldn't directly spit it out from its source code would it? the other question of whether it has a built-in value of Pi in its model
[05:28:51] <cloudcell> Right now the question is whether it has a built in constant or not. I say I doubt that.
[05:29:02] <Z-module> Any math-related software will have it.
[05:29:05] <cloudcell> it's a neural network, for goodness sakes
[05:29:11] <Z-module> It's pretty much the most famous real number that's not rational.
[05:29:33] <cloudcell> my post is a direct output from GPT
[05:30:20] <cloudcell> If I need to insert something extra into the network, I add RAW Paste Data as a prefix
[05:31:27] <nagefire> cloudcell from the model description it's possible that its corpus contained a chart with pi up to 300 digits or more of accuracy
[05:31:44] <Z-module> Okay, it might well not have the decimal string built it, but there are so so so many known series and integrals and formulas to generate them.
[05:31:45] <nagefire> cloudcell after all, such charts were common until slide rules, computers, and calculators were developed
[05:32:28] <cloudcell> Ok, suppose I reinvented a wheel, but it's good, is it not?
[05:33:37] <nagefire> I still want to know what you meant by "it gives 5 separate digits"
[05:34:13] <cloudcell> so the first one is 3.14.... then go 4 separate sequences separated by spaces
[05:34:43] <nagefire> that makes more sense
[05:34:51] <cloudcell> good
[05:35:28] <nagefire> looks like the AI didn't understand the gigantic block of random text you gave it before
[05:35:45] <cloudcell> yes, exactly my hypothesis
[05:35:54] <Z-module> anyway, the inner workings of ML and neural nets aren't the subject matter of this channel.
[05:36:28] <cloudcell> Z-module: sorry, we'll take it elsewhere, this had to do with the calculation of pi, actually
[05:37:21] <Z-module> Maybe, maybe not
[05:37:35] <Z-module> nothing in that post is about such calculation
[05:37:50] <nagefire> cloudcell there's an entire wikipedia article on approximating pi. It's not exactly difficult to derive it
[05:38:21] <Z-module> It's a vast well-traveled area.
[05:38:21] <cloudcell> I started the session with a simple question: "What's the formula for π? "
[05:38:25] <alphamule> Many many different approaches
[05:38:29] <[itchyjunk]> where is my piece of the pi?
[05:38:31] <Z-module> your "the" is erroneous, in that question
[05:38:40] <nagefire> even the earliest mathematicians had methods of approximation
[05:38:42] <alphamule> Arcsine is best way, then, cloudcell

[05:41:32] <Z-module> Speculating on how GPT works is so pointless, isn't it?
[05:41:46] <Z-module> Is there even a way to actually find out?
[05:41:52] <cloudcell> not really, i've been studying neural networks

[05:47:44] <cloudcell> ok, we digressed, I suppose the key point is whether the NN keeps a constant or not

[10:21:28] <somiaj> Because you cannot find a slope at a point (you must have two points)
[10:21:48] <somiaj> so to find a slope at a point, we take a limit of slope of secant lines, as the two points become one
[10:22:03] <somiaj> and the result of taking a limit is that both the left and right side limits must also exist
[10:23:01] <kakashiAL> I know, but why do we want left and right side limits, why do we enforce that?

[10:23:28] <kakashiAL> sure
[10:23:45] <kakashiAL> but do we force both sides, just to have something "well defined" ?
[10:24:04] <somiaj> there is no 'enforicing that', you take a limit, which means for every e>0, there is a d>0 such that if |x - a| < d, then | secant slope - tangent slope | < e
[10:24:17] <somiaj> it is the result of the epislon delta definition of a limit
[10:26:11] <somiaj> note in higher dimensions the whole idea of left-right limits doesn't make too much sense, it is just a byproduct of limits on the real number line
[10:26:29] <kakashiAL> you mean if you take the difference quotient, use epsilon-delta with it, it implies both sides?
[10:26:31] <somiaj> though here this has nothing to do with the derivative, but with limits, and the fact that on the real number line there are two directions to approach any real number.

[10:30:17] <somiaj> on closed intervals like [0,5] you only need one direction at the end points

[10:31:35] <somiaj> we want f'(0) = 0, so at the point 0 we only use the right side limit because there is nothing to the left of 0 in [0,inf)
[10:32:08] <kakashiAL> well, I knew that differentiation requires open intervalls, to be able to approach from left and right, but I always thought that this definition fall from the sky

[13:12:53] <Fohsap> joel135, what formula did you use to get there?
[13:13:05] <tekmunkey> I'm pretty sure I'd need to drink a hell of a lot more to think you were in your right mind, tbh
[13:13:07] <Fohsap> So a/1.25 = a.
[13:13:30] <Fohsap> You have been drinking then?  ;)
[13:13:36] <cherim> a/b=1.25 => b/a=1/1.25=0.80

[14:27:32] <evilscreww> you treat a really long wire like a cylindar
[14:27:35] <evilscreww> i hope i spelt that right
[14:27:44] <Fohsap> Huh?  I don't mind, man
[14:27:50] <evilscreww> the area is 2.5mm^2 then just guestimate the length, i did 50 meters
[14:28:01] <Fohsap> Yes, you treat it like a cyliner.  But I thought you had alread done that in your calculatoin
[14:28:17] <evilscreww> Fohsap no not you, i meant tekmunkey who said some horrible condescending words
[14:28:26] <Fohsap> the area of the circular surface at the end of the wire described and then multiplied by the length of the wire.
[14:28:41] <evilscreww> Fohsap i looked up the rough approximation of copper weight per volume

[14:29:07] <evilscreww> well hopefully ill be outta here by the time that happens
[14:29:10] <Fohsap> Anyway, you just take the volume and CONVERT it to the weight....
[14:29:10] <evilscreww> is he known for his temper?
[14:29:19] <Fohsap> then you take the weight and DIVIDE it by the price per unit.

[14:29:46] <Fohsap> See?  I have a 2nd-grade understanding of multiplication and division.
[14:29:50] <evilscreww> i got weight per cubic cm
[14:29:57] <evilscreww> AND THEN

[14:39:17] <int-e> The reason that I stress the 80%*125% form is that it's purely percentages; no "decrease" nor "increase" in there.
[14:39:55] <int-e> So it separates those concepts from the multiplication that explains why one compensates for the other.
[14:40:55] <cadmio> qergle: and Z_n is abelian, so it's just the corollary of the fundamental homomorpshim theorem

[14:45:08] <int-e> Fohsap: complementing this it may be worth seeing what happens when an x% decrease is followed by an x% increase (or vice versa): (1 - x/100)(1 + x/100) = 1 - x^2/10000. So if x is small that's close (but not equal) to 1. For x=10 you get 90%*110% = 99%, so that's often close enough. For x = 50 you get 50% * 150% = 75% which is usually not okay.

[15:37:24] <savask> And the year before it was kinda reminiscent of 2006, you had to figure out how to build a VM from "alien glyphs" and then solve small tasks inside the VM
[15:37:34] <riv> that sounds fun :O
[15:37:41] <savask> (and in the end code a game-playing AI, so cherim is kinda right, lol)

[15:38:48] <savask> It worked out pretty well for our team, but I can understand why some people say it was annoying
[15:39:22] <cherim> And it ended being the game AI inthe end, with meaningless stages
[15:39:55] <cherim> I only recognize the 2006 ICFPC (the codex) and 2007 (save Endo)

[16:56:33] <rubiksdream> kinda stuck on filling in the details for this: Let D be a domain (open+connected subset) of C, let E \subset D be compact, show that there is some constant M > 0 depending only on E and D, such that every nonnegative harmonic function u : D -> R_{>=0} satisfies u(z_1) <= M u(z_2) for any z_1,z_2 \in E
[16:57:33] <rubiksdream> so far I can show that there is some finite covering of E by balls B_i (say of radius r_i, centered at z_i) and a constant C > 0 s.t. as long as z_1,z_2 are inside one of these balls, and in E, we get u(z_1) <= C u(z_2)
[16:58:04] <rubiksdream> but im struggling to extend this to the result I actually want, i.e. go from here to *any* z_1,z_2 (not necessarily in the same ball)
[16:59:56] <rubiksdream> i think given E is path connected, i could prove this and change the constant to (number of balls)*C
[17:00:02] <rubiksdream> (or something like that)
[17:00:11] <rubiksdream> but if E is disconnected things seem a little more annoying
[17:02:33] <cherim> Can you first maximally enlarge E?
[17:02:57] <rubiksdream> thats what i was thinking, but im not sure what I even mean by that , lol
[17:03:09] <rubiksdream> as in make E as close to being path connected as possible..
[17:06:52] <[itchyjunk]> It says sketch the domain of |z-2+i| =< 1. this would be a circle centered at (2,-1) with radius < 1 right?

[17:18:51] <riv> I think the answer is yes but i can't imagine how to construct an example
[17:23:14] <rubiksdream> Gurkenglas they do not follow. There are examples of pseudo-metrics, i.e. maps d : X x X  -> R_{>=0} that satisfies the triangle inequality, symmetry, but do not satisfy d(x,y) = 0 iff x = y, e.g. take the space of integrable functions on [0,1], and define d(f,g) = int |f-g|, this is a pseudo-metric, and it induces a topology where the open sets are unions of balls

[17:24:34] <rubiksdream> given a pseudo-metric space, you can turn it into a bonafide metric space, by using the equivalence relation generated by identifying all pairs of points x~y s.t. d(x,y) = 0 under the pseudo-metric
[17:25:15] <rubiksdream> in the case of the example I just gave, this gives you L^1([0,1],lebesguemeasure) with the usual metric (induced by the L^1 -norm), i.e. we just identify functions that are equal a.e.
