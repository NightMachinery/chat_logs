[03:02:30] <JayF> I'm trying to figure out how to dynamically configure width of a ul that is display-block; such that all the text is guaranteed to fit on exactly one line, with no wrapping
[03:07:29] <JayF> https://home.jvf.cc/~jay/menu.html is the test case. I'm looking for ul.submenu and ul.lastmenu to dynamically size to ensure text never wraps in the menu. I can acheieve this, in longhand, by setting manual min-width on each of those elements, but it feels like there's gotta be an automatic way
[03:08:29] <JayF> Right now, the "anti" examples are the OS History tab, with lots of unneeded whitespace around all the items, and Downloads/Windows 3[snip] which wraps because it's longer than min-width
[03:09:09] *** Quits: LucaTM (~LucaTM@user/lucatm) (Quit: Textual IRC Client: www.textualapp.com)
[03:09:18] <FunkyBob> you can set the text to no-wrap, perahps?
[03:09:23] <FunkyBob> perhaps, even
[03:09:34] <JayF> lets try that
[03:10:24] <FunkyBob> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/white-space
[03:12:34] <JayF> white-space: nowrap; is exactly what I needed
[03:12:54] <JayF> I read that doc, but it wasn't clear that it would also help to make the underlying elements have... better information(?) for width: fit-content;
[03:13:07] <JayF> I assumed it would've just made the menu overflow outside the box, this is awesome \o/ I appreciate the help
[03:13:16] <FunkyBob> np
[03:13:23] <JayF> the sample version from above is updated to working, btw, if you want to see your handiwork

[03:15:25] <JayF> Do you have a suggestion for a validator, specifically for CSS, that I can use? If it autoformats, ala `go fmt` or black for python, that'd be even better
[03:15:38] <JayF> I don't think a standard HTML validator will like these go templates I'm writing against hugo
[03:16:42] <FunkyBob> nope
[03:16:52] <FunkyBob> I only validate outputs, not templates
[03:17:57] <JayF> I'm mainly worried about the CSS anyway; there's not much HTML and if it came up flawed in the output it'd be trivial to fix
[03:18:37] <JayF> but the CSS file I'm working off of was written by 10-years-ago me, who didn't know how to develop software at all -- and it's horrendous. (I know how to do backend dev now; but CSS -- or GUI of any kind -- is outta my usual wheelhouse)
[03:19:43] <FunkyBob> know how you feel... have been in just that place
[03:20:26] <JayF> Thanks for the help1
[03:20:29] <FunkyBob> there's more "CSS structuring and design" patterns than there are people spruiking them
[03:21:00] <JayF> Haha. I'm not trying to do anything crazy, just porting a very old site to hugo site generator and forcing myself to not just blindly copy+paste the CSS
[03:21:14] <FunkyBob> heh
[03:21:26] <FunkyBob> so, no new design... which takes a load off :)
[03:21:47] <FunkyBob> when I ported my blog from django to my custom SSG... I also redid the whole style, too...
[03:22:07] <JayF> Yeah; the hardest part, TBH, was recovering the actual content. Basically I had to convert an old wiki to a static site using httrack b/c the wiki was not being maintained anymore, and so I've had to extract all the dynamic data straight outta the html
[03:22:08] <FunkyBob> a dash of SCSS kept things orderly...

[15:30:43] <hmw[at]> pagios: It kind of is. CSS has evolved over time, so some things are not as intuitive. It needs practise and there are certain traps, newbies often run into, as:
[15:30:46] <hmw[at]> `divitis
[15:30:47] <Selvvir> hmw[at], Divitis is when you use tons of <div>s when you don't have to. Create the HTML for the page first, THEN style it. The fewer elements you have, the fewer problems you have.
[15:33:01] <pagios> i need a standard way of designing, not interested in becoming a true frontend dev
[15:33:12] <pagios> just something nice and neat yet gives me flexibility
[15:34:10] <hmw[at]> It is not rocket science. If you want to use HTML/CSS, you will need at least a good basis or a high tolerance for headaches
[15:34:55] <hmw[at]> Otoh, even for people who just want to be creative, CSS is still a nice tool after all. I am not trying to put you off, if can be fun

[15:46:40] <hassoon> they have been around since i was a kid

[17:23:24] <DPA> Fun fact: there are already 2 incompatible ways to invent html tags.
[17:25:20] <DPA> Custom elements are nice together with JS, as you have a JS class for them. But they require a - in the tag name.
[17:25:20] <DPA> The other way is older, using a custom DOCTYPE, and defining them there. Support has never been great, but it does work & should validate.

[18:09:44] <moniker-> and then enter url for the page and same thing happens there as well

The window with the text, tabs for the files, and a tree view of the files on the side. Stuff like browsers, consoles, etc. go on a different screen and/or virtual desktop.

[18:17:24] <hassoon> it's another independant software, that you can find runiing on the web aswell

[18:19:12] <moniker-> i actually tried starting coding in notepad++
[18:19:35] <moniker-> nothing wrong with it, but once you try vscode at least as beginner and then learning a bit or two you are blown away
[18:20:00] <moniker-> the quick references, intellisense or whatever is called, omg so good
