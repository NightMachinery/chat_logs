[04:11:57] <hyperbounce> basically just anything, how to use outlook/sharepoint, how to use X tool, etc

[04:14:28] <hyperbounce> that I made, but management is really pushing for these presentations
[04:14:33] <hyperbounce> in fact they want us to do 1 of them every month
[04:14:48] <sd_> 07<S​trongBad> And you can't present existing material?
[04:14:48] <hyperbounce> at least their like 10 minutes or so its pretty short
[04:14:59] <hyperbounce> we can yeah 
[04:15:29] <monr0e> oooh, you already have a kb. In that case, structure your presentation around finding the information in the KB. In a few months the presentations will become observably needless, which is when you can make the case to management to cull them
[04:15:37] <sd_> 07<S​trongBad> Will it be circulated outside of company/where will it be hosted
[04:15:55] <hyperbounce> it'll be added to our KB as a recorded video

[04:16:03] <hyperbounce> internal KB
[04:16:19] <monr0e> Then precreate the articles and ad them to the kb? 
[04:16:35] <hyperbounce> nah my manager def wont be satisfied with that, he wants to try to make it "Fun" so more ppl will join and participate

[04:18:03] <hyperbounce> like if someone asks me how to setup the VPN on their on home pc
[04:18:33] <sd_> 12<C​ardinal> hyperbounce, I usually will copy and paste a response or piece of the article, they at least think its personalized.
[04:18:44] <monr0e> @Cardinal HP was full of all sorts, both technical and non-technical folks. The key is to make the language in the kb accessible, without making it condescending
[04:19:01] <hyperbounce> yeah I cbf to copy paste 
[04:19:32] <hyperbounce> honestly this crap gives me anxiety too but i guess i should just do it
[04:19:34] <hyperbounce> and get it over w/

[04:21:37] <sd_> 12<C​ardinal> monr0e, I get writing documentation for the minimum viable user. I keep that in mind. I just always try to think about IT as a customer service role in addition to a technical one.
[04:22:56] <sd_> 12<C​ardinal> hyperbounce- yeah, I would have issues with it if it was remote/had to have a camera on. It is a huge hurdle to get over- most people don't get it.
[04:22:56] <sd_> 12<C​ardinal> I have my own psychological issues with seeing my own reflection, cameras included
[04:23:52] <monr0e> In some respects, IT is also a human resources role - which includes providing accessible training for employees at a reasonable expense. The key there is teaching employees to look for information first, and ask for help if they don't understand or cannot find it. That is part of the development of average skill - in another ten years, the amount of basic information we have to provide theoretically should decrease
[04:24:54] <hyperbounce> @cardinal it is remote lol

[05:28:55] <sd_> 13<J​ay-Ros> well, you're eyeballing a server's weight
[05:29:01] <sd_> 13<J​ay-Ros> and thinking it's heavy
[05:29:15] <sd_> 13<J​ay-Ros> but if there's four points of mount, the actual pressure per corner is 1/4 of that

[09:38:40] <monr0e> There's a laundry list of oracle bullshit in there
[09:38:54] <kerat58> glad you found a good clue, but still, I was thinking there had to be Non-Working Black Magic
[09:39:16] <kerat58> I wonder why they put rules in there, since they know you have access to security groups on the vnic anyway
[09:39:38] <monr0e> what I'm confused abotu is why uninstalling iptables did not fix the problem in the first place. Frankly, I'm not all clued up on how iptables works, though, so I'm probably missing something
[09:40:06] <kerat58> was there a reboot after the uninstall?
[09:40:08] <monr0e> I suspect some of the rules are there to facilitate installation of software via Oracles cpanel
[09:40:11] <monr0e> Yes!
[09:40:27] <kerat58> it could be that there's a cloud-init script that makes sure iptables is there on every boot then (just a guess)
[09:40:27] <monr0e> That's the weird thing. I got rid of ufw, iptables and something else, and restarted. No dice
[09:40:54] <monr0e> But it definitely wasn't there after the reboot, because I had to *reinstall* it just now
[09:40:59] <kerat58> oh

[09:52:49] <monr0e> There's a whole host of other reasons that I've gone into before here, as to why I dislike the current "cloud everything" mentality
[09:52:50] <kerat58> just have to make sure that if you're on-site that you have good power redundancy and also, that whatever ISPs you are using do not have overlapping upstreams
[09:53:36] <monr0e> Ah, I'm fortunate enough to be able to connect directly to a reasonably local exchange - which might be a preferable option, depending on cost and infra requirements
[09:53:49] <kerat58> oh nice
[09:54:04] <monr0e> doing so would allow me ridiculous bandwidth, but there *is* the equipment side of things to consider
[09:54:19] <kerat58> a week ago for instance i had a bunch of self hosted clients who weren't aware that they had overlapping upstreams...and that the common denominator was twelve99
[09:54:35] <kerat58> twelve99 decided to randomly throttle traffic 
[09:55:18] <kerat58> was a mess
[09:55:25] <monr0e> Throttling is part of the reason I want a direct hookup
[09:55:47] <monr0e> its a horrible mess in the UK, rate limiting gets nasty in peak hours

[09:56:26] <kerat58> well in our case the throttling is really killer b/c we have long running connections
[09:56:33] <kerat58> like one connection is opened and data transferred fo rhours
[09:56:43] <kerat58> it is not a quick in-and-out like http request
[09:57:40] <monr0e> Posting your backups over hte net? 
[09:58:13] <kerat58> it is a data mining applicaiton, so in broad terms, there's a bidrectional socket. t he user sends us some raw data, our app 'crunches it' ,and then streams back the results 
[09:58:19] <kerat58> it is basically like a brokerless message queue
[09:58:54] <monr0e> oooh that's a challenge for a p2p style setup if ever I saw one

[09:59:09] <kerat58> so if you throttle that, the thing breaks down
[09:59:19] <kerat58> because now things come back late
[09:59:19] <kerat58> very late

[10:04:16] <kerat58> server A- jammed/delayed
[10:04:20] <kerat58> server B - in cloud - working fine
[10:04:25] <kerat58> it is websockets protocol btw
[10:04:27] <kerat58> not regular tcp 
[10:04:46] <monr0e> even so
[10:05:03] <kerat58> it is annoying because as a semi-managed service we cannot pinpoint exactly why the customer rpovided hardware doesn't work properly
[10:05:19] <kerat58> but i do keep a few cloud credits on hand at all times to spin up a "proof it isn't OUR software" whenever neededd
[10:05:37] <monr0e> Do they all have a common ISP?
[10:06:05] <kerat58> i have traced a few to colo spacing in the same Data Centre
[10:06:11] <kerat58> who claims to be carrier neutral
[10:06:24] <kerat58> so look at this, one time we had 3 clients down at the exact same time in that data center
[10:06:30] <kerat58> i got ahold of the NOC 
[10:06:50] <kerat58> i told them look; these AWS servers work fine, your severs in your facility do not
[10:07:09] <kerat58> we did some traceroutes and in that particular case, we found that they were peering directly with CloudFlare 
[10:07:12] <kerat58> at a local peer point
[10:07:29] <kerat58> they changed their routes, so that instead of peering at the IX, they actually go through the general internet, to another cloudflare node further away
[10:07:29] <monr0e> hmm
[10:07:37] <kerat58> when they did that, those 3 clients come back up instantly
[10:07:37] <monr0e> I've had some issues with cloudflare lately
[10:08:10] <kerat58> However - we later added a domain that is not under CloudFlare but has the same exact APi (it is just a domain that points to the same server w/o CF basically)
[10:08:30] <kerat58> Another incident of the exact same characteristics; but instead of changing their routes to CF, they changed their routes to us directly
[10:08:34] <kerat58> and that once again fixed it
[10:08:46] <kerat58> so it seems like it is a route issue of sorts -- but WHAT?
[10:08:53] <kerat58> how can a route issue cause a packet to arrive, but 10 minutes late
[10:08:58] <kerat58> i thougth timeouts would happen 
[10:09:12] <kerat58> but it is WebSockets, so i guess timeouts do not really apply in the same way as long as something is coming in at all times, even if it is throttled
[10:09:17] <kerat58> ugh, i dunno, it is a PITA

[10:10:00] <monr0e> I wonder if that api has somethign to do with it. Flood prevention maybe?
[10:10:31] <kerat58> I'd lean towards that but if we spin up an AWS node taht send the exact same queries, it works, so if the data they were sending triggerd something, it "should" trigger it no matter waht server is sending it

[10:12:56] <kerat58> i do know that twelve99 was showing in the traceroute during one of these epsiodes
[10:13:05] <kerat58> so that is a coincidence or possibly a lead
[10:13:54] <monr0e> ngl, that whole thing matches up with some odd internet behaviour I've seen over the past few months
[10:14:02] <kerat58> like what?
[10:17:02] <monr0e> NL to UK peerings at 80+ms with ~40ms jitter, same kind of issue with a routing centre in Long Island. Twelve99 being involved in both of those occasions. There was also some weird sync behaviour before the solstice, RDP and VNC sessions were behaving very oddly. I forget whether or not Twelve99 was involved that time, but I'd hazard a guess as to the affirmative. Meanwhile, one single issue with a cogent appliance, and after a 
[10:17:02] <monr0e> non-customer email was sent from myself, it was fixed inside 48hrs
[10:17:37] <kerat58> right
[10:17:42] <kerat58> yeah people were complaining
[10:18:12] <kerat58> But as always, the info I have available is "noisy" (not precise).  The twelve99 thing is a good lead, but the same NOC techs also claim they have mitigation in place even on outbound traffic, and that it can be "Very sensitive"
[10:18:17] <monr0e> I have a staging machine in Germany that I was playing around with, and I couldn't deploy to it through Visual Studio.
[10:18:24] <kerat58> so it could be them messing things up too
[10:18:50] <kerat58> monr0e:  It needed to open a socket, and the connection wasn't stable enough to do the asset deploy?
[10:19:04] <monr0e> Pretty much. Or, it would open a socket, and just hang
[10:19:22] <monr0e> I don't know how VS deployment works under the hood, though, other than the ports it uses
[10:20:34] <kerat58> yep
[10:20:40] <monr0e> I was also going to suggest that something to do with how that api interacts with residential IP addresses vs DC addresses could have na impact, particularly if they are acting as traffic *monitors*
[10:21:16] <monr0e> Cloudflare does have some mitigation in place for devices on their network that flood other devices
[10:24:40] <kerat58> well, one general conclusion i could reach is that perhaps the Websocket connection is being viewed as a "long lived HTTP connection "(since it is still port 443); and that "someone, somewhere" decides to throttle that whenever there's some network issue or congestion
[10:25:17] <kerat58> who exactly "someone, somewhere" I don't know, but again, with good cloud providers it does not happe, so whatever routes and/or mitigation strategies they are choosing do not fall for this same issue

[10:31:30] <kerat58> i wonder if at this point things like kubernetes are overused, where there are workflows where it is 'overkill' and people are just using it so that they can say they use it
[10:31:47] <CableNinja> its a sad truth kerat58 
[10:32:29] <CableNinja> management hears about it in some sales pitch or some news article, suddenly things its the hot new thing and it must be used for everything especially their usecase, and they force it on the rest of the teams without consideration of the real result
[10:33:37] <CableNinja> thats what happened the last 2 times it got pushed into my teams workload, and the best part... they werent even ready for docker, so nothing worked and I wasted 6 months befre snapping on the CEO for something else
[10:34:39] <kerat58> wow
[10:34:47] <kerat58> yeah very premature if your workflow isn't docker friendl yyet
[10:34:54] <kerat58> * friendly yet
[10:35:04] <CableNinja> their fuckin database wasnt even database friendly lol
[10:35:38] <kerat58> lol
[10:38:15] <kerat58> well at the very least, with volume binding, you can take apps that require config files and 'pass in' a config file, things like that
[10:39:14] *** Quits: shakygator (~shakygato@user/shakygator) (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
[10:41:21] <kerat58> also maybe some of you cloud guys know...if you have an on-prem mySQL database that is a decent size (over 500gb) and you want to move that to a cloud based offering, is there a migration strategy?  
[10:41:37] <kerat58> doing an "Sqldump and restore" is not gonna work with a db that size; the recreate time will be "forever"
[10:42:40] <kerat58> but i also do not know if you can migrate the directory itself (as if you were moving from one regular server to another)
[10:43:09] <kerat58> i know the directory move works if you stop the DB and do it with regular servers, but with cloud DBs, you may not have the same administration capabilities as bare metal hardware
[10:47:23] <monr0e> live migration with replication maybe?
[10:47:44] <monr0e> assuming VON anyway
[10:47:48] <monr0e> *VPN
[11:10:09] <CableNinja> yeah
[11:10:13] <CableNinja> thats my suggestion too
[11:10:39] <CableNinja> setup a db in the cloud, do an initial dump, configure replication. wait for it to catch up
[11:11:13] <CableNinja> once its caught up, you flip the roles, so the original server is the replicant, and the new one is the main one
[11:13:18] <CableNinja> you cant just move the directories because you have no access to the files for the db

[11:16:27] <kerat58> yes that's the issue -- the "initial dump" for a DB that large, in MySQL
[11:16:37] <kerat58> A dump of the DDL is going to take for-ever to restore I think
[11:16:43] <kerat58> but i dunno, have to do a time trial i guess
[11:17:17] <CableNinja> yeah, its not a fun process
[11:17:24] <kerat58> but the replica part is sound
[11:17:43] <CableNinja> you can likely speed up parts of it by migrating individual tables
[11:18:32] <kerat58> right
[11:18:33] *** Joins: Bideford (Bideford@dsl-217-155-169-214.zen.co.uk)
[11:19:13] <kerat58> i guess the reverse is possible too (migrating from cloud back to a regualr dedicated server), by setting up a replica locally and waiting for it to 'catch up' (however long that is), then flipping the roles again
[11:19:22] <CableNinja> yeah
[11:20:20] <CableNinja> you may also have -slightly- better luck and speeds if you migrate to a virtual instance in that cloud provider (not a db instance, but a vm instance). and then replication from there to the destined cloud db
[11:20:42] <kerat58> yes, less hop 
[11:20:46] <kerat58> better routes
[11:20:56] <CableNinja> in that method, you could technically lift and shift the files, and then your only bottleneck is the speed between the providers instance and db instance

[16:40:47] <thegodsquirrel> You would need to do some research to understand what packages / dependencies will change from 18 to 22
[16:40:56] <shibboleth> afaik 22.04 isn't out quite yet

[16:41:28] <shibboleth> or whatever newfangled method is en vogue these days

[21:37:58] <csws> int0x1C8, the guys who started mitel worked for bell at the time and didn't want them to be aware of the fact their new company was telco related so they called it Mike and Terry Lawnmowers

[21:46:39] <AnonymooseReddtr> lots of spammers will take advantage of
[21:46:57] <csws> bdenlinger, I had the pleasure of both deploying it and being on the receiving end of the crap users report

[21:48:23] <sideup66> those stupid xp sata drivers
[21:48:25] <Hunterkll> no, replaced the PSU in my model 70 and had to take out the bracket iwth the CMOS battery
[21:48:26] <Hunterkll> config poof
[21:48:38] <Hunterkll> and this early, no BIOS config tools existed in the bios
[21:48:46] <Hunterkll> bootable reference diskette only 
[21:48:47] <Hunterkll> :)
[21:48:49] <sideup66> ahhh need to run a bios config thing
[21:48:49] <csws> AnonymooseReddtr, I decompiled the DLL and had a look and there's an x-header you can set to say that it's a phish test, you give it an invalid campaign ID and if a user reports the e-mail it'll black hole the report (since it's just an empty catch {} on the http request) and the user gets a "good boy!" message
[21:48:50] <Hunterkll> so now it's unbootable and lost time
[21:48:51] <csws> it's amazing
[21:49:03] <sideup66> do you have to map out the sectors on the drive still
[21:49:11] <sideup66> or have you retrofitted that with a compactflash?
[21:49:16] <Hunterkll> no no
[21:49:22] <Hunterkll> that's older still
[21:49:25] <Hunterkll> this is an ESDI drive
[21:49:26] <Hunterkll> lol
[21:49:36] <AnonymooseReddtr> csws but can't you send spam and inject that xheader into your message 
[21:49:40] <AnonymooseReddtr> voila bypass filters
[21:50:30] <Hunterkll> but lol fuck i don't know where any of my usb floppy drives are
[21:50:33] <Hunterkll> so here's hoping one of these is it
[21:50:43] <sideup66> oh god facebook
[21:50:43] <Hunterkll> oh wait fuck
[21:50:44] <csws> AnonymooseReddtr, yeah it's a mail header. anyone can use it and because the addin is checking for it, even if the admin was good to only trust KB4 spoofs from certain IPs, it'll still blackhole any attempt from the user to report it
[21:50:45] <sideup66> wtf
