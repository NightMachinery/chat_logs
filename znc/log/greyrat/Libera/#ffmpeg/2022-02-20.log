[00:03:35] <muji369> why would it be that ffmpeg changes the frame rate to variable when the source is constant framerate?
[00:04:48] <BtbN> define "changes constant to variable framerate"?
[00:04:51] <muji369> actually that's not true, the source has variable frame rate
[00:05:02] <muji369> BtbN: sorry, i should have been more precise
[00:05:20] <muji369> i'm encoding a video. the source video has constant frame rate. the output video has variable frame rate
[00:05:27] <muji369> but i think the source in this case has variable frame rate, actually
[00:05:38] <muji369> is there a way to make it constant, but preserve the framerate?
[00:05:38] <BtbN> So ffmpeg changes the framerate, or what do you mean?
[00:05:48] <BtbN> If a framerate is constant or variable is determined by the timestamps of the frames.
[00:06:32] <muji369> BtbN: i mean that the i want the output to have a constant framerate
[00:06:35] <muji369> rather than variable
[00:06:38] <muji369> (as reported by mediainfo)
[00:07:14] <BtbN> What does mediainfo refer to with its claim of it being variable?
[00:08:06] <muji369> i'm not entirely sure, actually
[00:08:11] <muji369> also since it seems to be wrong

[00:11:39] <muji369> this is weird, since mediainfo reports "constant" frame rate for the source video, but not for the encoded video
[00:12:01] <muji369> i wonder what the default is

[05:30:35] <snover> Hi! I am writing a QTVR implementation using libav. I need data from some atoms on the data track of an ISO base movie (trak.mdia.minf.gmhd.STpn and trak.mdia.minf.stbl.stsd.pano). Looking at `mov_read_default` and `mov_parse_stsd_data` it looks like libavformat just skips these unrecognised atoms and that I will need to write a separate parser if I want to access these data, but I just wanted to double check that Iâ€™m not being dumb and missing

I'm exploring ways in which I could possibly also distribute this app on the macOS App Store (for free of course) to make it easier for non-technical users. Â  Â  Â I would obviously need to disable GPL and non-free components, but I am
[07:49:20] <kolmogorov> wondering if the resulting LGPL binary could be distributed with the App Store binaries. I think this might work by publishing the project under a GPL- and App Store-compatible open-source license, and allowing users to specify a custom path to the FFmpeg executable, as to my understanding, the LGPL is non-viral iff the user is able to trivially
[07:49:20] <kolmogorov> replace the distributed binary with their own copy. I would of course also include links to the project and FFmpeg source code in the app along with other requirements described by the LGPL and the Legal page on the website. Â  Â  Does anyone know if it's possible that this could be compliant? Sorry if these questions are way off the mark, I'm not
[07:49:21] <kolmogorov> well-versed in legal stuff
[07:51:41] <kolmogorov> Ah scratch that, I think https://stackoverflow.com/questions/459833/which-open-source-licenses-are-compatible-with-the-apples-iphone-and-its-offici just answered my question
[07:52:19] <kolmogorov> > One of the major problems with the LGPL and using static libraries in applications that are distributed through application stores is the requirement that you distribute the tools and scripts that are necessary for an end-user to rebuild the software.
[07:53:31] <kolmogorov> Oh well at least macOS still allows running unsigned apps......for now.......

[07:58:27] <aphysically> hmm, I think I can reproduce the problem even in the neighbor swscale where it gets white pixels that aren't in the original at all

[09:30:36] <itt788> i need to concatenate two files, which i do with filer_complex, but i also want to re-encode audio of the output.
[09:30:50] <itt788> can i do that in one step only?
[09:36:12] <crashrep> yes. I'm pretty sure you have to re-encode the video and audio if you combine using the concat filter
[09:37:41] <itt788> you mean  "complex_filter" does not allow concatenation without re-encoding?
[09:38:24] <furq> filtering happens after decoding
[09:38:35] <furq> if you want to concat without reencoding then use the demuxer
[09:47:06] <itt788> i want video stream to be copied and audio to be re-encoded into 48k opus with a loudnorm parameter
[09:48:48] <crashrep> itt788: try using the demuxer like this: https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/Concatenate#demuxer

[10:04:20] <aphysically> this also explains why I only got weird white outlines only sometimes when scaling pic subtitles
[10:04:28] <aphysically> it depends on the alpha mask color
[10:04:34] <aphysically> anyway I just always premultiply picsubs now
[10:04:49] <aphysically> and now the scaling looks correct :^)

[11:25:28] <tm512> so it turns out that having another application playing audio through hw:Device,0 blocks ffmpeg from being able to record, which... doesn't really make any sense

[12:01:58] <jarthur> alright
[12:03:55] <jarthur> And you've confirmed with arecord -l that the hw address is the same you're expecting, and that newer driver hasn't subdivided the device down differently?
[12:06:08] <tm512> arecord -l gives: card 2: Device [USB Audio Device], device 0: USB Audio [USB Audio]
[12:06:27] <tm512> and I'm passing hw:Device,0 to ffmpeg
[12:07:03] <tm512> it works perfectly fine as long as another application isn't playing audio through the device
[12:08:55] <aphysically> okay, so the correct way to overlay image subtitles is
[12:09:11] <aphysically> subtitle->premultiply->scale2ref->overlay (with ~default opts)
[12:09:18] <jarthur> Does arecord -l look the same when this other app is playing audio through the device, tm512?
[12:09:41] <aphysically> I thought I might need an unpremultiply or something but apparently overlay is fine with what it gets from scale2ref even when scale2ref doesn't do any scaling or whatnot
[12:09:43] <aphysically> or at least it seems to be that way

[12:29:22] <tm512> well technically there are more layers of abstraction than that, the default output pcm is a plug device with a multi device as a slave that routes the audio both through the aforementioned dmix device along with another dmix device that has hw:Loopback,0,0 as a slave
