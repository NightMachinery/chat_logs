[00:00:17] <GinFuyou> Yes that's what I meant
[00:00:32] <dre_> yeah
[00:00:35] <GinFuyou> But should it be in the form? So user-changeable?
[00:01:25] <dre_> yeah, so any posts that don't fit a "section" will go to the "general" section, which is more like just general chat.
[00:03:23] <GinFuyou> That's not really an explanation. What if user changes it to be a comment for different section? Maybe closed one?
[00:03:55] <dre_> yeah that's fine and allowed
[00:04:06] <dre_> (not the closed one, we don't have closed sections)
[00:04:18] <GinFuyou> Ok, fine then
[00:04:31] <GinFuyou> Just provide a real instance, or maybe PK
[00:04:36] <dre_> actually, no, if they try to go to a closed section then it will error out, that's fine. further down the track
[00:04:43] <dre_> yeah thanks, I'm doing that now
[00:05:25] <GinFuyou> They don't have to go to closed section, they may post from any other one changing section in their input

[00:35:20] <twomoon> pycharm is not really integrated with git

[00:46:57] <Steve-Dusty> could someone teach me what docker is used for?
[00:47:01] <Steve-Dusty> why do you need Docker in Django
[00:47:13] <Steve-Dusty> LordKalma i'm in middle school
[00:47:15] <Steve-Dusty> what's ur grade
[00:47:24] <twomoon> wow middle school...

[00:48:42] <Steve-Dusty> wait wut???
[00:48:46] <Steve-Dusty> PhD!??!
[00:48:48] <Steve-Dusty> in what?
[00:49:03] <LordKalma> telecom engineering
[00:49:11] <AnselmoCampanas> you may use docker for create containers that run all the application dependencies without the need of install all that dependencies on your operative system, also it is very convenient to have dockerized your application in order to deploy it
[00:49:11] <Steve-Dusty> oh
[00:49:18] <LordKalma> my master was in engineering physics
[00:52:55] <twomoon> docker is like a virtual environment
[00:53:11] <twomoon> except it's not just a venv for python packages
[00:53:27] <LordKalma> docker is the best thing evahhh
[00:53:27] <twomoon> it's a virtual environment for the entire system (kinda)
[00:53:33] <LordKalma> could be a bit more ergonomic
[00:53:35] <LordKalma> but it's so cool
[00:56:07] <twomoon> i'm sure Docker concept existed before Docker
[00:56:20] <twomoon> Docker is like a virtual machine config file
[00:56:27] <AnselmoCampanas> yeah, containers are old stuff
[00:57:17] <twomoon> back when you had VirtualBox and VMWare , you would fire up a configuration. some configs had Fedora, some had Debian or Windows
[00:57:27] <twomoon> that's basically the same concept as Docker
[00:58:00] <AnselmoCampanas> the main difference is that in docker the hardware is not virtualized as an abstraction
[00:58:39] <twomoon> how could it not be virtualized?
[00:59:17] <twomoon> I guess I don't fully understand Docker (I have never used it)
[01:00:22] <LordKalma> Docker is soft virtualization
[01:00:37] <LordKalma> I don't understand it either, but it doesn't have the same penalty as regular vms
[01:00:54] <LordKalma> You don't have to reserve cpu space, ram, vram
[01:01:07] <LordKalma> It's magic, basically. And that's what cool about it
[01:01:27] <twomoon> can Docker switch OSes?
[01:01:38] <twomoon> can your Docker have a different OS than your base OS?
[01:01:42] <LordKalma> There are containers with all sorts of distros underneath
[01:01:50] <LordKalma> And you can run said distros on Windows hosts
[01:01:54] <LordKalma> Sometimes with caveats
[01:02:06] <twomoon> then how the hell is it not virtualized - that doesn't make sense
[01:02:44] <LordKalma> I would love to know

[01:05:08] <twomoon> or waht Anselmo thinks
[01:05:24] <LordKalma> It seems that on Linux it shares the kernel
[01:05:35] <LordKalma> And it's just userspace stuff
[01:05:41] <twomoon> I would say it does use hardware virtualization in general because it seems there's an extra abstraction layer if you are using Windows as your base OZS
[01:05:42] <twomoon> OS
[01:05:47] <LordKalma> But on Windows it fires a hyper-v vm
[01:05:58] <twomoon> and sharing the kernel is a kind of virtualization
[01:06:05] <twomoon> it's just that it's built into linux, seemingly
[01:06:21] <LordKalma> Reminds me of openVZ in a way
[01:06:27] <LordKalma> Or was it openVK

[01:12:47] <Steve-Dusty> we did a presentation with associated student body last week
[01:13:25] <dre_> make a practise site ( like a forum / facebook clone or something ) with a big todo list and let people hack and add to it
[01:13:34] <Steve-Dusty> we welcome beginners
[01:13:37] <dre_> or a collection of member sites

[01:15:00] <dre_> i mean it's your club so you do whatever but that's an idea

[01:15:10] <Steve-Dusty> and then  use flask

[01:15:19] <Steve-Dusty> JavaScript too
[01:15:22] <Steve-Dusty> hM okay
[01:15:25] <LordKalma> twomoon: kvm is a virtualization technology. It is a very thin layer over the bare metal. It's what most virtual servers you can rent use. The good ones at least
[01:15:59] <twomoon> it seems that linux has some virtualization support built into it already, or am i wrong?
[01:16:21] <LordKalma> I've seen James Powell do flask with a single file. Loved it.
[01:16:23] <twomoon> or is that just some variants of linux?

[01:38:28] <Steve-Dusty> should I learn React or svelte first
[01:39:06] <dre_> react is more industry focused, Svelte is if you want to learn it and go your own way, but surely you knew that already.
[01:39:22] <dre_> make some django projects with tailwind, it'll probably work far nicer for you
[01:45:21] <Steve-Dusty> hey
[01:45:39] <Steve-Dusty> I don't understand thhe purpose of custom user authentication
[01:45:40] <Steve-Dusty> of django
[01:45:52] <Steve-Dusty> what's the difference between using at and just using the pre-built user one
[01:46:23] <dre_> most commonly people bolt-on some sort of Google auth, so you can "log in with google" and etc.
[01:46:30] <dre_> but other than that, there's no real reason.
[01:47:12] <Steve-Dusty> Hm
[01:47:31] <Steve-Dusty> dre_, I don't understand why they don't let users login with email instead
[01:47:39] <Steve-Dusty> why is the default username + password
[01:47:50] <Steve-Dusty> that's not good user exp
[01:48:06] <dre_> I think you can change django to use email. ( ie username is email )
[01:48:18] <dre_> idk find out for me and let me know I haven't got to that yeet.
[01:49:13] <Steve-Dusty> all the tutorial I found
[01:49:21] <Steve-Dusty> not one shows only email + password
[01:49:27] <Steve-Dusty> it's either email + username and password
[01:49:40] <Steve-Dusty> not one teaches how to do email + password. I wonder how instagram did it
[01:49:50] <hylje> if you want to do it your own special way, you can replace a lot of how authentication is done
[01:50:12] <dre_> hylje, the goal is to not replace how authentication is done
[01:50:21] <dre_> but just change it to email + pass
[01:50:22] <hylje> generally i'd just recommend setting a custom auth user model that's exactly like the django default one
[01:50:43] <hylje> so if you want to modify the model, it's within your migrations and you can change it later
[01:51:07] <dre_> all of the docs seem to advise against changing the user model. :\
[01:51:56] <hylje> changing the model after you've already set one is nontrivial as you have to "adopt" the existing db table
[01:52:28] <hylje> changing the model fields and methods is hard because built in auth stuff has expectations and you will easily break them
[01:53:10] <hylje> but just having a custom auth user model that's a direct inheritor from the conveniently provided abstract user model doesn't break anything
[01:53:29] <dre_> hmm, ye ok
[01:53:39] <dre_> as long as related apps don't rely on things like username

[02:57:32] <dre_> I think we're all good devs for using django
[02:57:33] <Steve-Dusty> btw funkybob that club I started
[02:57:41] <Steve-Dusty> what should I teach for first meeting
[02:57:49] <Steve-Dusty> it'll help me so much for college
[03:00:06] <FunkyBob> hmm
[03:00:17] <FunkyBob> am trying to think back to  the time I ran "MelbDjango School"
[03:01:13] <FunkyBob> I liked to start with basics -- how a web request works; url -> dns -> server connection -> request -> response
[03:01:38] <FunkyBob> then delved into some of the history of how servers handled resolving the response for a given request
[03:01:53] <Steve-Dusty> https://github.com/MelbDjango
[03:01:54] <Steve-Dusty> what's this
[03:01:59] <FunkyBob> direct file mappping, compiled in code, loaded scripts, external scripts [cgi], external services
[03:02:07] <Steve-Dusty> but im not a god liek you
[03:02:11] <Steve-Dusty> should I start with HTML
[03:02:25] <FunkyBob> not a bad place to start, sure
[03:02:39] <FunkyBob> this is for high school, right?  not university level
[03:03:46] <FunkyBob> MelbDjango was the django meetup in Melbourne, Australia...
[03:03:52] <FunkyBob> and for a time we ran a free 'school'

[12:29:37] <dre_> I'm with serafeim
[12:29:44] <dre_> LordKalma, how is it lacking?
[12:29:52] <dre_> FunkyBob, I broke things :(
[12:30:00] <LordKalma> not as trivial to do, is it?
[12:30:13] <dre_> it's as trivial as literally anything else
[12:30:48] <dre_> I think django makes things even more trivial because of how it sets up the ORM and admin/ to overwrite things easier than having to implement your own versions of the same thing
[12:31:56] <dre_> FunkyBob, if I want to have a DetailView for a "forum-thread" and a form on that detailview so that a person can post a "comment"
[12:33:00] <dre_> I got it going, initially, but the Comment.content from the form was overriding the Post.content ( obviously get_object() was returning the Post, form.save() was setting the content)
[12:33:22] <dre_> actually, hmm. I'm dumb. gimme a sec
[12:33:45] <FunkyBob> LordKalma: how is django lacking in SPA support, exactly?
[12:34:00] <FunkyBob> dre_: so... you want a list view? or detail view?  that can accept a post?
[12:34:25] <dre_> I was thinking DetailView on the post; the comments were just tacked on.
[12:34:40] <FunkyBob> dre_: ah, so no threads, just posts and comments?
[12:35:21] <dre_> FunkyBob, I'm thinking if i just remove the super() call here, wouldn't that just do what I wanted ( the k_operations.add_coment will create the comment for me. I'm thinking, I don't want to continue evaluating the comment after that. but does this need to return something?)
[12:35:38] <dre_> FunkyBob, yeah, I'm thinking just post and comments.
[12:35:45] <FunkyBob> am a little lost as to the actual goal, before I comment on solutions
[12:36:49] <dre_> FunkyBob, basically, I get Post.content and CommentForm.content overlapping each other, like this: https://imgur.com/q4cV5B3
[12:36:52] <FunkyBob> so a Thread is a topic with a series of Posts, yes?
[12:37:10] <FunkyBob> Post and CommentForm are models?
[12:37:22] <dre_> no, just Post and Comment. ( i said thread as generalising but i shouldn't have)
[12:37:42] <FunkyBob> what is the diifference between a post and a comment, practicallt?
[12:37:46] <dre_> AddCommentForm is a ModelForm (for Comment)
[12:37:53] <dre_> not much
[12:38:09] <dre_> but in the future I wanted to have different post types, like posting an Event, posting a Poll, etc.
[12:38:18] <dre_> which I was just going to put as different classes.
[12:38:44] <dre_> no good?
[12:39:19] <dre_> looking at this, I'm so dumb. nevermind I'm going to bed xD
[12:39:36] <dre_> UpdateView on a Post, with a CommentForm, no wonder django's getting confused.
[12:39:50] <dre_>  /I'm/ confused
[12:40:36] <dre_> FunkyBob, There's also this part of the docs but I don't think it helps me here: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/topics/class-based-views/mixins/#an-alternative-better-solution
[12:41:09] <dre_> maybe I should just write things out manually and stop using the generics until I figure out the model structure more

[13:22:23] <carloratm> Hi all, Id like to override the DEBUG setting for a testcase, it seems to be impossible. One must set that settings before running the tests and it can't be changed. Am I correct?
[13:25:48] <FunkyBob> isn't there a provided test utility to override settings?
[13:26:07] <carloratm> yes, it is. But it's not working for DEBUG
[13:26:36] <FunkyBob> template_backends/test_django.py:    @override_settings(DEBUG=False)

[18:56:04] <hylje> if child transactions can have child transactions forever, it can be a recursive rel
[18:56:08] <twomanytacos> hm... i don't think so, all the calculations are based on the main Txn
[18:56:33] <hylje> if you know there's just one layer of further transactions, i'd have two models with a simple rel
[18:56:34] <twomanytacos> ChildTxns need to match Txn, but we won't query ChildTxns
[18:57:37] <twomanytacos> child txns won't have child txns
[18:58:27] <moldy> twomanytacos: if you don't query ChildTxn, what is it for?
[18:59:14] <hylje> recursive rels are neat but... i hope you like writing tree walking algorithms

[21:38:09] <YourAverageCoder> Its my first time posting here so apologies for the multiple messages. I have recently started getting an error on my Django ASGI application with the error message: "ASGI 'lifespan' protocol appears unsupported". I use the following command to start my Django application: "gunicorn --bind :8000 --workers 4  --worker-class
[21:38:10] <YourAverageCoder> uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker myapp.asgi:application". I have read in a couple of places that adding a " --lifespan=on" would solve the issue but I think guicorn does not support that because if I add that I get the error: "gunicorn: error: unrecognized arguments: --lifespan=on". Has anyone faced a similar error or would know the solution to this?
[21:38:10] <YourAverageCoder> Again, reaching out here to see if anyone knows a quick fix to this.
