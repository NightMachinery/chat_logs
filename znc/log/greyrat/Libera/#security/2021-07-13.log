[00:01:25] <lall-> maybe not, butan honest discussion still.
[00:01:29] <lall-> all points are valid.
[00:01:45] <mats1> it is relevant, all of these things are ~bugs~ that create ~attack surface~
[00:02:01] <lall-> well systemd certainly created some.
[00:02:40] <ajak> it's generally not attack surface that isn't already there, though
[00:03:07] <mats1> torvalds, or de raadt, or rms, are effectively ddosed all the time, by aforementioned wankers, which robs projects of management
[00:03:34] <mats1> failure to exterminate the wankers with extreme prejudice, is just one of many ways we get to the state of insecurity today
[00:03:35] <lall-> trying to be everything at the same time is an attack surface. there are dozens of security issues with systemd that the creators just dismissed completely
[00:03:48] <ajak> lall-: for example?
[00:04:28] <lall-> there was a case 3-4 years ago that pottering denied being a security issue
[00:04:41] <ajak> share it?
[00:04:53] <lall-> where you could gain root privs by an admin making a mistake in them systemd ini files

[00:06:05] <ajak> well, you could've linked directly to the github issue linked by that HN post :p

[00:07:41] <lall-> that one was one of them
[00:08:10] <mats1> the wankers are not even necessarily showing up with malicious intent. they instead ask stupid questions on the ml, which could be answered by actually reading the ml or the code in question, and then individual contributors are now also being ddosed instead of fixing bugs or working on features
[00:09:05] <lall-> well, politics. people shit on RMS constantly because of his random opinions of his friends instead of his achievements.
[00:09:23] <mats1> the wankers 'just want to be included', 'be seen', finagle a commit or two in a 'sexy' project like the kernel, and then can put it in their cv or tell their boss so they can get bonused or promoted later
[00:09:27] <lall-> there was an article on /. saying how torvalds went to a sensitiy camp and now he's all better

[00:15:30] <mats1> the epstein/maxwell adjacent whore, out of obvious self preservation, chose to name a dead guy, instead of actual names, like royal pedophiles
[00:15:54] <mats1> but, this, is 'evidence', and sticks, so now rms is also a pedo by association, or whatever

[11:39:29] <TheLinuxNerd> cyberwar can end today, all the US has to do is cease any active intelligence operations against North Korea, China, Russia, ... and they will cease theirs
[11:40:24] <lind{at}yahoo> that's not what the game theory says
[11:42:20] <lind{at}yahoo> we're always going to have differences with our adversaries (by definition): there needs to be a structure in place (UN CYBERCOM) to arbitrate those, and to get everyone to sit down at the table we need to marshal our Alliances cyberpower to shape their utility curves into agreeing to sit down at the table
[11:43:00] <TheLinuxNerd> lind{at}yahoo I'm against any side-taking, any war, I'm for peace ... and union of all nations, in your paper you consider some nations adversaries, that's wrong

[11:45:37] <TheLinuxNerd> stop competing, start collaborating :-)
[11:46:01] <lind{at}yahoo> we are adversarial with several major actors right now, and I agree we must find a way to move on from that, but we have real differences to settle and the fact is to get closer to settling those differences we have to go back and forth
[11:46:27] <lind{at}yahoo> TheLinuxNerd: did you read page 14 (UN CYBERCOM) of that paper I linked
[11:47:02] <lind{at}yahoo> basically UN CYBERCOM *IS* that stabilization mechanism

[13:11:41] <Apachez> dunno, I only use 7zip if I want to use some commercially available stuff
[13:11:50] <Apachez> or zip it and push it through gpg or similar
[13:12:08] <Apachez> the pro thing of using zip is that windows users can access the content without additional apps
[13:14:57] <StayHungry> alright, i found a tool that supports metadata encryption of zip files https://github.com/zlib-ng/minizip-ng

[13:16:28] <StayHungry> and 7-zip still does not support that, what a shame
[13:16:47] <Apachez> question is can a regular winzip or win7 builtin ziphandler be able to decrypt the file incl the filenames?
[13:16:52] <Apachez> sure 7zip does
[13:16:55] <Apachez> but only for 7z as format
[13:17:11] <StayHungry> i speak about zip only, 7z is another story
[13:17:17] <Apachez> you have a checkmark to the right when you compress files just above where you put in the passphrase
[13:17:28] <Apachez> yeah but if you got 7zip you wouldnt be using zip :)
