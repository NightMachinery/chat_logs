[02:20:02] <irc_user> Well now that you mention torrenting, I do remember in the past sharing large archives with friends and the downloads would almost always fail. So I think torrenting might just be the best way.
[02:20:27] <MrElendig> if the data is actually private; consider encrypting the files
[02:20:45] <MrElendig> depends on what you mean by private though

I can get it to work again by restarting X, but this isn't ideal.  Is there some other way to get it to come back up after suspend?

[02:45:20] <jacki> srsly
[02:45:31] <Edu4rdSHL> jacki, why? You are going to download the packages from the repos...
[02:45:56] <Edu4rdSHL> You can configure local repos on pacman.conf and it will not require internet then
[02:46:04] <jacki> it may be nice, but should be an option disabled by default

[06:00:06] <mpan> Define “secure”.
[06:00:37] <kenshi> mpan: is it hash bugs, for example can someon use bug in x11 and take control of my linux...
[06:00:52] <mpan> “Secure” doesn’t have any single meaning.
[06:00:53] <kenshi> mpan: is it have bugs, for example can someon use bug in x11 and take control of my linux...
[06:01:10] <kenshi> mpan: su i can use it without problem?
[06:01:11] <Namarrgon> okt: if it's still only a pkgver bump then i wouldn't bother
[06:01:20] <mpan> Sure, one can. Which is a completely useless answer, because you are asking a wrong question.

[06:03:33] <mpan> kenshi: you seem to have a wrong perspective on the entire topic of security, which lead to you asking questions that have no answer in the realm of any serious talk about security.
[06:03:58] <kenshi> mpan: so how i should ask?
[06:04:08] <kenshi> mpan: becase security to me it mean alot
[06:04:09] <mpan> kenshi: with that type of a question, the answer is: yes, it’s secure. Not because it is secure, but because there is no way to explain to you the problem if you keep using that way of thinking.
[06:04:32] <kenshi> mpan: oh i undestand
[06:04:42] <nshp> security from what?
[06:05:24] <kenshi> nshp: from the world
[06:05:57] <mpan> kenshi: you are treating security as some global, coherent, absolute concept. With software either fitting it or not. But that’s not how it works. There is no such thing as unqualified “secure”.

[06:08:54] <mpan> In that situation the answer is: just stop worrying and use it. Perhaps with time, if you wish to learn, you will understand the problem enough to ask the question again in a meaningful manner. Though I suppose then it will not be needed. :)
[06:09:08] <kenshi> mpan: okay i ask normal question, let say for example there exploit on kernel arch and hacker have script of that exploit su it mean hacker can hack my machine and everyone else becase of the bug and stole files and do alot of things

[16:53:20] <BrainDamage> I did that with my chroot and worked fine
[16:53:49] <Voidwarper> from googling current options are, xhost + on the host, so the chroot system can talk to xserver on host. or i can ssh into the chroot from the host, with X forwarding.

[23:21:32] <mpan> Yeah, because the maintainer is working on the PKGBUILD and pushed it to the git, but no package has been built from it so far. And no, there is no trivial way to make “Source files” link to point to what the current package uses: it would require passing and maintaining additional information somewhere.
