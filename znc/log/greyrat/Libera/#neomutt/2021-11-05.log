[15:23:42] <pescepalla> would there be a reason i get this warning:

[15:23:59] <flatcap> hi pescepalla 
[15:24:00] <pescepalla> after i've already done
[15:24:02] <pescepalla> bind index t noop
[15:24:11] <pescepalla> hello flatcap
[15:24:16] <flatcap> I was just about to reply earlier, and you vanished
[15:24:25] <pescepalla> sorry, had to go to work
[15:24:30] <flatcap> np :-)
[15:24:40] <pescepalla> thanks in advance
[15:25:02] <flatcap> I tried the four lines you listed earlier and they worked for me
[15:25:11] <flatcap> which version of neomutt do you have?
[15:25:16] <gahr> I did that too :) hi pesce palla
[15:25:18] <gahr> nice name

[15:25:38] <gahr> papa' papa', il pesce palla.. mh? bang! muto deve stare!
[15:25:46] <pescepalla> :)
[15:26:23] <pescepalla> it's more like my chinese name -- it's a long story
[15:26:33] <flatcap> good, fairly recent
[15:26:53] <pescepalla> arch, btw
[15:27:22] <flatcap> can you try just the four lines in a config file: bind, 3*macro, then run `neomutt -n -F test.rc`
[15:30:07] <pescepalla> no warning
[15:30:28] <flatcap> ok, good.  so something else in your config it causing trouble
[15:31:15] <pescepalla> i grepped all of my config files and there's nothing else with "t" in bindings
[15:31:16] <flatcap> it's a bit crude, but the next step is to start commenting out bits of your config to identify *which* bit is bad
[15:31:24] <pescepalla> right
[15:31:27] <pescepalla> yes
[15:31:43] <pescepalla> this will take some time :) i'll get to it
[15:31:55] <pescepalla> and i'll report back
[15:32:04] <flatcap> yeah, sorry :-)  no rush, we're always in here
[15:32:12] <pescepalla> np thanks for helping out

[18:17:32] <gahr> but we don't even reach there
[18:18:54] <gahr> https://github.com/neomutt/neomutt/blob/master/mx.c#L1342
[18:19:44] <gahr> mh
[18:19:44] <motherfsck> I'm noticing that neomutt is downloading the entire message as I scroll through the pager.  I can grep for the subject and find the mail in the cache dir even though I've never opened it.
[18:19:50] <motherfsck> Is there a setting that {dis,en}ables this?  I'm scrolling through my config and the reference guide and I don't see anything that's immediatly obvious.
[18:19:51] <gahr> I think I don't understand how compress work
[18:19:59] <flatcap> ah
[18:20:04] <gahr> do we just write the file as is, then hook in the command to compress it?
[18:20:24] <gahr> cause how are we going to figure that a file is supposed to be compressed
[18:20:40] <flatcap> er, I think it's a pipe
[18:22:39] <gahr> I don't understand how we set  it up
[18:23:40] <flatcap> motherfsck: just a sec...
[18:24:40] <flatcap> we save to 'file.xz', which doesn't exist, but the compressed mbox has a matching open-hook
[18:25:06] <motherfsck> flatcap: no worries I'm patient and lurk in here all the time anyway
[18:25:49] <flatcap> the probe should give type MUTT_COMPRESSED
[18:26:26] <flatcap> it saves to a tmp file, then runs the hook to create the real compressed file
[18:27:10] <flatcap> the "non-existant" check in path_probe() is bogus -- that leads us to assume mbox
[18:30:37] <flatcap> motherfsck: when you open a folder for the first time, neomutt needs to read the headers of every email
[18:31:04] <flatcap> for local mail, that means opening each file.  for imap, we download the specific headers we'll need
[18:31:43] <flatcap> if you have the config: "set header_cache = DIR", that info will be cached in a local database
[18:32:31] <motherfsck> Yea, that's behaving as expcted, and I have the headers cached in lmdb.  But the body off the mail is being downloaded and stored in the message cache directory, I can see 'fetching message' as I page down
[18:32:34] <flatcap> when you next open the folder, that local cache is enough to populate the index (except for new emails, obviously)
[18:32:54] *** Joins: gabriel1 (~gabriel1@user/gabriel1)
[18:35:01] <motherfsck> think this could be caused by using unignore to grab a few additional headers and using one of those to populate the index could be the root cause
[18:35:08] <motherfsck> guess i could test that pretty trivially
[18:35:16] <flatcap> if you're in the pager, then when you change emails, the *body* of _that_ email needs to be fetched
[18:35:53] <flatcap> hmm... perhaps
[18:37:04] *** Joins: gabriel1_ (~gabriel1@37.165.177.166)
[18:38:41] <flatcap> opening an email in the pager, or searching, e.g. "~b xyz" (body) will cause neomutt to fetch emails (and cache them if $message_cachedir is set)
[18:38:51] <motherfsck> I'm talking about as I page down in the list of emails it fetches each individual message before it finished drawing the page
[18:38:58] <motherfsck> I'll double check that nothing with ~b is defined
[18:39:19] <flatcap> ok, that shouldn't happen by default
[18:39:55] <flatcap> perhaps a index color
[18:39:57] *** Quits: gabriel1 (~gabriel1@user/gabriel1) (Ping timeout: 268 seconds)
[18:40:06] <motherfsck> yep, index color '~R~h "tags: work"'
[18:40:19] <flatcap> aha!
[18:41:07] * motherfsck hrm
[18:41:20] <motherfsck> now to figure out how to approach that problem a little better
[18:43:34] <flatcap> hmm... in imap/message.c we ask the IMAP server for X-LABEL
[18:44:40] <flatcap> ~Y EXPR   messages whose tags match EXPR 
[18:44:56] <flatcap> that _might_ work
[18:45:06] *** Joins: rgrinberg (~textual@200.5.63.76)
[18:47:05] <flatcap> nope, ~y (lower case) seems to refer to X-Label in the code
[18:47:49] <gahr> flatcap: so you say we should just check compressed before mbox?
[18:48:06] <motherfsck> I control these tags/headers with sieve so I could just change tags to x-label
[18:49:11] <gahr> it's been there for years
[18:50:20] <flatcap> motherfsck: "~y label" works and it doesn't download the bodies
[18:51:28] <flatcap> gahr: yes, compressed needs to come first because it probes by using the filename, rather than stat()
[18:52:13] <gahr> which fixes openin a gz
[18:52:17] <gahr> but now writing to it
[18:53:28] <gahr> appending to is works fine
[18:53:49] <gahr> fg
[18:54:03] <gahr> so if you have an alrady gzipped file, it works
[18:54:11] <gahr> but writing to a new foo.gz doesn't make it compressed
[18:54:43] <motherfsck> flatcap: ~y label works as long as I add X-Label instead of tags. which is easy enough
[18:56:23] <flatcap> great.  I can't remember where IMAP tags fit into the fetching of messages

[19:08:22] <gahr> m->pathbuf is /tmp/whatever
[19:09:28] <gahr> sorry, I'd need to understand the whole business of how compressed work
[19:09:30] <gahr> still confused
[19:09:42] <flatcap> according to the top of compmbox/compress.c
[19:09:44] <flatcap>  * - mailbox->path     == plaintext file                                                                                                                      
[19:09:47] <flatcap>  * - mailbox->realpath == compressed file 
[19:11:43] <flatcap> what doesn't work for you?
[19:12:14] <flatcap> [devel/comp] just comments out a couple of checks.  compressed seems to work, but I haven't considered the effect on other mailbox types
[19:13:18] <gahr> the compressed file is not a mailbox
[19:13:24] <gahr> i.e., it's not in the mailbox list
[19:13:45] <gahr> so mailbox_find(m_save->realpath); won't find it
[19:14:04] <gahr> the plaintext file *is* in the mailbox list, though
[19:15:58] * flatcap steps through mutt_save_message()
[19:19:36] <flatcap> m_comp = mailbox_find(mailbox_path(m_save));
[19:22:49] <flatcap> hmm...
[19:23:54] <flatcap> it needs to search by the realpath, because the tmp file changes :-)
