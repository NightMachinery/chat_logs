[03:25:58] <sonny> it seems to indicate that software made by the best, isn't even that great
[03:26:24] <sonny> yeah, I can see how they would profit from much lower development costs
[03:27:48] <sonny> flakland: I see, guess that's why some licenses say "THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT."
[03:28:35] <flakland> i've always felt that line was just a paranoid inclusion
[03:28:54] <flakland> in case microsoft wants to sue you for loss of services or something from a DOS bug
[03:29:47] <epony> it saves resources, free software is a public good
[03:29:52] <sonny> I'm glad open software exists, all this license stuff is for the birds
[03:30:35] <flakland> open software does exist, but if a proprietary system is using it, its no longer open software
[03:30:46] <epony> and building with and over it means it will get important usage and will make commercial systems better
[03:30:58] <sonny> flakland: why not?
[03:31:03] <flakland> maybe if they didnt change a damn thing and you can drop in a replacement its still open, but if they changed anything it's no longer open
[03:31:23] <epony> so it's important that quality free software exists and is used, instead of bad "independent" implementations that are error prone and inefficient
[03:31:28] <flakland> that's semi-transparent software

[04:45:56] <[itchyjunk]> sonny, the biggest critism is he advertised autopilot as "autopilot"
[04:45:58] <communistmuslim> Elon Musk is actually pretty incompetent from what I've heard and seen about him, although I've never met him myself
[04:46:07] <[itchyjunk]> and a lot of people are upset that it's not autopiolet in practice
[04:46:08] <perro_> he's an idiot svant
[04:46:15] <[itchyjunk]> its just the most advanced lane assist and such
[04:46:22] <communistmuslim> What he is good at, is making money, paying people to create his visions, and then taking credit for them himself
[04:46:27] <sonny> I will assume tesla is pretty much mostly in the USA and some other top performing countries?
[04:46:33] <flakland> of course numbers matter, 100% of teslas with accident avoidance and awareness vas  what % of toyotas with those features?
[04:46:37] <communistmuslim> but it doesn't take a 100IQ score to make big money
[04:46:38] <[itchyjunk]> communistmuslim, he make his first 2 ventures out of his own hands.
[04:46:43] <[itchyjunk]> No one but he and his brother.
[04:46:51] <[itchyjunk]> He made his first $100M by coding.
[04:46:55] <communistmuslim> [itchyjunk], it doesn't take intelligence to succeed in business.

[06:28:39] <Gdegree> 3D printed plastic guns stands as an ultra formidable antagonist of gun control and at that rate any weapon

[06:29:04] <Gdegree> caring about who got a gun 
[06:29:25] <Gdegree> logic dictates and leads you right to anarchy 
[06:29:32] <communistmuslim> Because I lived in China for 2 years, 1 of which, I was a practicing monk at the Shaolin Temple in zhengzhou. I lest the monk lifestyle, to pursue a life in Canada where I was born. But after fighting in 3 wars for my country and then realizing the wars were not justified and the cause was oil and helping american hegemonic domination of the world... I stopped liking being in Canada. I worked with 
[06:29:33] <communistmuslim> CSIS for several years doing classified work which I gained skills from that have lead to my before becoming Muslim and not being allowed to use violence, taking over countries simply to install a democracy and human rights and freedoms. Now I don't even think freedoms and democracy, or a significant number of human rights, are a good idea.

[06:31:27] <Gdegree> this network reminds me of the 3D printable liberator 
[06:32:50] <communistmuslim> But now some group of rebels who refused to join my Jihad against ISIS, are dying by the truckload trying to fight a war I told them I would give them 2 years training and education before we even attempted... And they message me on Facebook with cries for help, with women and children begging me to save them... But they did exactly what I said not to do. Which was try to combat the enemy without my

[07:16:32] <anomal> The former camp is a lot more by the numbers.
[07:17:02] <InPhase> anomal: While this can increase some comprehension of fundamentals at an earlier timepoint, it's pretty basic psychology that such an emphasis down-values creative thinking, which comes with a cost.
[07:17:21] <oldlaptop> It's also certainly *not* limited to east/south Asian school systems, even if they're known for taking it to a relative extreme
[07:18:00] <oldlaptop> (or even for doing the rote-memorization thing *better*, for that matter)
[07:18:05] <anomal> Of course I'm in no position to judge the outcomes of these approaches. Maybe we need some platform to step on and then we can do the creative thinking on our own. But I'm a sucker for "analysis" and "contemplation" videos, where I can pick the minds of thinkers and tinkerers.

[08:26:40] <anomal> And that order impacts how it's read after
[08:26:50] <anomal> We can pretend there's no order, or we can decide what order to have.
[08:27:12] <anomal> The latter is the pragmatic and useful approach, the former is the idealistic useless approach

[08:29:43] <oldlaptop> SQL has a concept of "subqueries", where one query may reference another as though it were a table.
[08:29:58] <ski> no, an individual photo would be an element of (or an attribute of an element of) the computed relation/subset

The order isn't actually relevant.

[08:38:59] <anomal> hard to reproduce states I mean
[08:39:31] <anomal> It's much better to have an unordered set where you can ask it "do you have X" and get yes or no, but not iterate it.
[08:39:35] <anomal> Then you have no arbitrary actions
[08:39:48] <anomal> And if you want to iterate it, define an order
[08:39:54] <anomal> Simplest order: time.

[08:40:06] <ski> oldlaptop : mm, i see. i guess if there were not just a simple `max(...)', but a variant that gave you a subset of the `n' greatest elements, then that `ORDER BY' wouldn't be needed
[08:40:08] <anomal> For lack of other, time works
[08:40:51] <oldlaptop> ski: There may be some cleaner way to do it, offhand. (LIMIT is not even standard SQL, but it's a common extension. The standard syntax is IIRC different.)
[08:41:39] <ski> "\"do you have X\" and get yes or no, but not iterate it." -- contravariant subsets (as opposed to covariant, or invariant if you have both operations)

[08:42:55] <oldlaptop> anomal: Imposing order on everything, in something like a real relational database engine, is not free - and in fact ORDER BY can be *very* expensive under some circumstances. There isn't always some "natural", deterministic order.

[08:44:36] <oldlaptop> Yes. That's not relevant here.

[08:45:43] <anomal> oldlaptop: every well-formed table has a PK. Every PK has an index. That index is 99% of cases a B-tree. Which implies ordering by PK is free. Which is the most common PK type? Synthetic. What type? Autoincrementing int. Hence it's literally time ordered by default
[08:45:54] * ski agrees with oldlaptop
[08:46:22] <oldlaptop> That is not responsive to my point.
[08:46:26] <anomal> oldlaptop: we're not discussing whether all SQL queries to the same thing, but whether order is not free in RDBMS. Turns out it's practically free, because everyone has a PK and an index on it that is ordered
[08:46:43] <PlanckWalk> There are still costs
[08:46:50] <rindolf> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSQL - hardly anyone remembers that
[08:46:51] <bayaz> Title: mSQL - Wikipedia 
[08:47:09] <anomal> PlanckWalk: what are the costs if you are already ordered.
[08:47:12] <PlanckWalk> Not all indexes are based on btrees
[08:47:16] <anomal> The cost to be ordered when you're ordered is 0
[08:47:20] <anomal> PlanckWalk: yes not all.
[08:47:21] <PlanckWalk> And many queries are byu keys that arent' PK
[08:47:24] <oldlaptop> Order of some particular relation on disk does not necessarily correspond to the order in which results are returned from a query, because queries may be *considerably* more complex than "pull some stuff out of this one relation".
[08:47:34] <anomal> PlanckWalk: they don't have to be PK
[08:47:50] <oldlaptop> (And if they are not, that's a good indicator that you're not using SQL's power very well.)
[08:47:57] <anomal> Having multiple orders doesn't mean you're unordered, why are we so confused about this
[08:48:10] <PlanckWalk> All you can really say is "the results come in the order they come" if you don't impose an order.
[08:48:26] <PlanckWalk> And that order may in many cases depend upon implementation
[08:48:26] <anomal> PlanckWalk: my point is to impose an order
[08:48:37] <PlanckWalk> Yes, and imposing an order is often expensive
[08:48:42] <anomal> No
[08:49:01] <anomal> You folks are really missing the point of what I'm saying.
[08:49:09] <PlanckWalk> Eh, not worth arguing.  Go ahead, implement your DB how you like, and find out.
[08:49:30] <anomal> I'm only saying that iteration should happen in a defined order
[08:49:34] <oldlaptop> All kinds of decisions on the part of the DBMS can affect the order in which a complex query happens to yield its results, and which decisions it makes can (and do) change from execution to execution for reasons that are not necessarily obvious, or even *observable*, to user code.
[08:49:43] <anomal> PlanckWalk: I am
[08:49:44] <PlanckWalk> anomal: I know what you're saying.  I disagree.
[08:49:56] <anomal> PlanckWalk: you've cited no facts to support that
[08:50:09] <PlanckWalk> Don't care enough.  Do what you like.
[08:50:15] <anomal> PlanckWalk: what's a realistic scenario when you iterate something with no order to hang onto
[08:50:23] <PlanckWalk> Also, it's obvious to anyone who has done a decent amount of DB work.
[08:50:27] <anomal> A table with no PK or a hashtable PK
[08:50:32] <anomal> That's not common, at all
[08:50:44] <oldlaptop> Taking sqlite as a practical example, if some other database connection runs ANALYZE on your database, sqlite can suddenly start using completely different query plans that result in completely different "natural" orders.
[08:50:48] <PlanckWalk> Wrong, but asd I said, you'll learn.
[08:50:50] <PlanckWalk> as*
[08:51:04] <anomal> PlanckWalk: I've been using SQL for 20 years so I wonder what I'll learn
[08:51:09] <Decker> with row order delete and re-insert can shuffle row order of what you might think is just 1-10 ordered
[08:51:21] <oldlaptop> Imposing a defined order on a query requires, in the worst (and fairly common) case, storing the whole result set somewhere (in memory, or on disk), sorting it, and *then* yielding the results.

[08:52:50] <anomal> PlanckWalk: yes and what are the options.
[08:52:54] <Decker> they're not scanned unless you have bad indexes; but the indexes are scanned in their relative column order - which row order has no relaveance to 
[08:53:22] <PlanckWalk> Ideally, it doesn't "scan the table" at all.
[08:53:30] <PlanckWalk> That is usually a dumb thing to do.
[08:53:54] <anomal> PlanckWalk: identifying a range of rows is scanning that range in the index.
[08:54:00] <anomal> You gotta learn how queries work

[09:01:17] <Decker> anomal in a bad design maybe - I use the indexes that are required - which may be multiple - especially with joins
[09:01:22] <Decker> I don't.
[09:01:54] <Decker> which means most of the time *I* query I wouldn't expect PK order to have anythign to dowith the result order

[09:05:02] <beaky> yes this might be confusing primary keys and indexing (though they can be related in certain ways like in sql server where they have 'clustered indexes' on unique primary keys by default so the data in the table is in fact always sorted)
[09:05:04] <PlanckWalk> You get an ordering, but you can't guarantee that it's stable or has any particular properties unless you *ask* for a specific order, and that has costs.
[09:05:05] <Decker> :) probably a pragama in sqlite to do that 
[09:05:10] <anomal> Let's take this a step back. So we match on "name". We have an index on "name" because "of course" for some reason. The DB will load that index, locate the entry on that name, which will be one or more PK VALUES.
[09:05:17] <anomal> What's the next step here

[09:05:43] <oldlaptop> anomal: Suppose there's a join involved.
[09:05:44] <anomal> If we just asked for PK and name, we just scanned this in the order of the name index. We use that order

[09:10:56] <PlanckWalk> You're wrong about the consequences.
[09:11:07] <PlanckWalk> It *can't* be specified at no cost.

[09:11:34] <anomal> PlanckWalk: great argument then
[09:11:36] <anomal> fuck
[09:11:38] <PlanckWalk> Awesome
[09:12:12] <anomal> My only point was as simple and dumb as this: do not permit iteration without leaning into a known order.
[09:12:24] <anomal> If you CAN NOT provide an order, DO NOT provide iteration.
[09:12:26] <anomal> See?
[09:12:46] <anomal> Means for example if you have a dictionary, you can index into it, but you can't iterate it
[09:12:56] <anomal> UNLESS it specifies an order
[09:13:03] <PlanckWalk> Yep, and that's dumb.
[09:13:06] <oldlaptop> Sometimes, the order does not matter, and failing to impose order where it does not naturally exist can provide a substantial efficiency improvement.

[09:15:08] <anomal> Crickets
[09:15:13] <PlanckWalk> (See what I mean about going off on digressions that miss the point?)
[09:15:22] <anomal> And no answer 
[09:15:25] <oldlaptop> There is, in fact, *more* cost in the general case for an RDBMS, because complex queries do not necessarily have any easily-defined "natural order". (Or at the very least imposing such a "natural order" takes away the database engine's ability to make important optimizations.)
[09:15:50] <PlanckWalk> anomal: You can read the reasoning yourself.

[09:17:18] <oldlaptop> (If they do, a relational database does not buy me very much.)

[09:17:34] <anomal> oldlaptop: did me writing in all caps that we're not talkig about order OF QUERIES was too hard to understand last time
[09:17:49] <anomal> We're not discussing the order of query results.
[09:18:43] <oldlaptop> Then what are we discussing? Query results are what the users of relational databases generally "iterate over", which seems to be what you're on about.
[09:18:55] <anomal> No it's not what I'm on about at all.
[09:19:09] <oldlaptop> <anomal> My only point was as simple and dumb as this: do not permit iteration without leaning into a known order.
[09:19:22] <anomal> I'm discussing how the DB engine iterates tables. Obviously if you just dump a table, you'll also see it in your queries, but that's BESIDE THE POINT
[09:20:11] <anomal> oldlaptop: I was talking about tables the whole time. And guess what BTW. The result set, once computed... is also a table.
[09:20:22] <anomal> oldlaptop: and guess what, that table also has an order...
[09:21:11] <oldlaptop> What everyone else is trying to tell you is that the order of this result set table is unpredictable in practice unless the database engine deliberately sorts it.
[09:21:23] <anomal> You keep trying to twist what I'm talking about as if I'm saying there's an "inherent correct order of queries". Which is nonsense.
[09:21:37] <Decker> (I'd really hope it rarely itereated over tables) and then there's a vareity of ways that rows are browsed with indexes - which rebalance and rebuild as data is inserted; even iwthout delete and replacing a slot in table row order with some other row (though I suppsoe all PK are autoincrement too, and not OID))
[09:22:13] <PlanckWalk> Iteration order through table entries is very often not stable.
[09:22:22] <anomal> Decker: you iterate over tables implicitly all the time, but if you're lucky it's a range, not the whole table. Scanning a range is still iterating it
[09:23:13] <anomal> The DB searches into the B-tree, locating the bounds of the range. Then scans that range. ITERATES IT
[09:23:45] <PlanckWalk> That's not generally true.

[09:25:36] <anomal> PlanckWalk: what cost.

[09:25:41] <anomal> WHAT COST
[09:25:51] <anomal> It has two locations: range start, range end.
[09:25:57] <PlanckWalk> The cost of enforcing that guarantee, which is often substantial in DB indexing.
[09:25:59] <anomal> That's the cost of starting at the start and ending at the end
[09:26:15] <PlanckWalk> As I said, there is often not just one range.
[09:26:21] <anomal> You just keep rephrasing the same phrase "the cost is the cost born out of the cost"

[09:34:22] <anomal> PlanckWalk: point being even if a table lacks indexes, at least it has a PK
[09:34:31] <anomal> So a well formed table has at least one index

[09:39:22] <Decker> but then you'd have to specify an order for everything that doesn't sound fun
[09:39:22] <anomal> But it has a hash PK
[09:39:25] <Decker> some order

[09:40:03] <anomal> You can index into it, but not iterate it. It's a very simple idea

[09:40:31] <anomal> PlanckWalk: no, it's a black box.
[09:40:40] <PlanckWalk> That's already a cost.
[09:41:05] <PlanckWalk> The cost of not being able to do something you previously could.
[09:41:07] <anomal> Yea types are a cost, so let's all schlep everything in scripts.

[09:41:47] <PlanckWalk> You were saying there is no trade off since there's no cost.
[09:41:54] <anomal> Decker: if you join on the ID, you get access to the rest of the row, as it's stored under the PK

[09:57:26] <sonny> is it done in C cause everything else already is?
[09:58:17] <anomal> sonny: it's a "host" language that's running on your CPU, save for the extra primitives and keywords that run on the GPU. So in short: yes.
[09:58:34] <PlanckWalk> anomal: "It's a cost, but the cheaper one was a mistake"
[09:58:39] <sonny> I guess if you want to run a program that uses opengl, you need opengl, you also have to implement the interface on your os
[09:58:44] <PlanckWalk> Still bargaining.
[09:59:19] <anomal> PlanckWalk: I already acknowledged that by your continuously expanding definition of cost, everything has a cost
[09:59:49] <PlanckWalk> Heh
[10:00:08] <anomal> Cost also has a cost.
[10:00:14] <PlanckWalk> I've been using the same definition throughout.  You've just caught up.
[10:00:22] <PlanckWalk> So glad we agree now.
[10:00:47] <anomal> PlanckWalk: we agree about everything, in fact we're probably the same person this whole time

[10:05:01] <anomal> PlanckWalk: here's a kicker. I think allowing iteration with no order is a cost. 
[10:05:17] <anomal> That's right. Empire strikes back!
[10:05:18] <anomal> :P
[10:05:47] <anomal> PlanckWalk: and you acknowledged that cost by saying in JS there are benefits to enforcing order

[10:15:32] <apotheon> The Analytical Engine is probably not meaningfully implementable.

[10:23:21] <anomal> PlanckWalk: not that you care but I'm implementing a variation where data is stored in small arrays at the end of which there's a pointer to another array (so hybrid of both), and there's indexing by hash index. This allows actually ordered iteration despite the hash.

[13:02:52] <pikapika> I don't get the complains of windows devs about the myriad of new ui frameworks microsoft made and abandoned. For one, I find it really hard to imagine why someone enjoys being locked into a single language/runtime (C#) for their apps. And secondly, the C api is still there, whats stopping you from using it?
[13:04:18] <GeDaMo> Maybe because they might have to modify code using one of the abandoned frameworks?
[13:04:26] <psydroid> maybe they don't learn to use the C api anymore
[13:04:34] <psydroid> or don't want to
[13:04:40] <pikapika> What framework?
[13:04:45] <pikapika> You don't need any framework to use the C apis
[13:05:04] <psydroid> but I think it's the only sane thing to do
[13:05:46] <psydroid> if you don't want to become dependent on an api or framework that is going to be abandoned sooner rather than later
[13:05:48] <pikapika> Unlike Linux where the lowest level publicly exposed framework (X11) is too low level for general gui dev and we have to use toolkit libraries on top, in Windows the lowest level C apis do in fact include the shell first class.
[13:08:15] <psydroid> X11 is actually getting abandoned, so I wouldn't base any code on it except for some kind of learning experience

[13:12:41] <pikapika> I don't see how its harder to use than any other ui framework
[13:12:46] <deniska> it's fairly low level, and is probably hard to tap into newer features

[13:33:16] <psydroid> vdamewood, you wouldn't, you would just reimplement .NET apis as native C++/Rust code. But that is probably something Microsoft would never do.

[13:35:02] <psydroid> I think the .NET apis are nice, but the performance isn't there and frameworks built on/with it are getting abandoned. So I share some of the concern pikapika has with development using Microsoft's newer toolkits.
[13:35:06] <vdamewood> psydroid: Well, the whole point to using the .NET Runtime is the .NET Runtime, if you don't want to use it, then don't use it. The APIs are either available in some other form anyway, or rely on specific behavior in the .NET runtime.

[13:37:24] <psydroid> I was learning MFC once and it was horrible
[13:37:35] <pikapika> Even so, my main point is that, why is a general purpose computer (your android phone) in practice actually so constrained? Why can't we just install whatever os we want on it as we do with desktop systems? (The answer is obvious of course)
[13:37:53] <psydroid> something like C++ Builder made much more sense
[13:38:11] <pikapika> psydroid, I haven't used any of the C# frameworks so I don't know about them.
[13:38:39] <pikapika> I was just speaking about programmers who complain about windows native dev being difficult due to a proliferation of C# frameworks in various states of support
[13:38:48] <pikapika> My answer to them is, why don't you use the C apis
[13:38:53] <psydroid> and yes, I did some .NET programming in 2001 after a Microsoft developer sent me a prerelease of Visual Studio .NET and a C# textbook
[13:39:21] <psydroid> but then I tried to do some lower-level stuff with it and found I couldn't, because Microsoft restricted access to that
[13:39:33] <psydroid> and I lost interest in all of that stuff
[13:41:00] <vdamewood> pikapika: By the way, the reason I dropped it is because I realized I was arguing the wrong point and I didn't really disagree with your (real) point.
[13:41:16] <pikapika> vdamewood, explain
[13:41:21] <deniska> pikapika: the problem with winapi, is that it's even in the worse state of support than frameworks they are complaining about :P
[13:41:48] <vdamewood> pikapika: This: vdamewood, I am not talking about them. I am seeing some new devs who are bemoaning the complexity of development on Windows due to having to select among all these frameworks of the years.
[13:42:06] <pikapika> But its more or less a decades old finished product, so we don't really need "support"
[13:42:34] <vdamewood> pikapika: So for me ot was like "Oh, that's the point. Yeah, I can see that."
[13:42:39] <pikapika> vdamewood, I must say part of the problems is also that many people learned web dev as their first exposure to programming
[13:42:59] <pikapika> WIth such an education one simply does not have the key mental concepts of native in the first place
[13:43:02] <pikapika> Thats also an issue
[13:43:05] <pikapika> vdamewood, yes indeed
[13:43:13] <pikapika> A lot of complexity seems self inflicted
[13:43:23] <pikapika> There is indeed a lot of true, irreducible complexity too no doubt
[13:43:28] <pikapika> But a lot of self created problems too

[13:48:28] <user51> conclusion: TBD. lovely :)
[13:50:14] <psydroid> There is this ridiculous issue on Github about Microsoft making MAUI available on Linux and people arguing for not making it available for Linux because no one uses it. But that means that many developers are abandoning Microsoft tools completely in favour of something like Flutter or a myriad of other frameworks/toolkits that don't discriminate between platforms for mostly business reasons.

[14:17:49] <psydroid> it would be far easier to just write a new application using Qt/C++ from scratch

[19:06:03] <anomal>  What if we introduce a new concept for handling objects. You can't reference them, but you also can't move them. You create them in a place, and they're there. Can't move them.
[19:06:26] <Decker> objects don't generally move
[19:06:55] <anomal> Decker: yes, but I mean you can't pass references around to them either
[19:07:11] <Decker> I did implement Defragment(&p) which could move a block to defragment memory; but that's not something that's done
[19:07:30] <Decker> I don't know if you mean references or pointers that are references
[19:07:31] <adder> so what do you suggest, copying a 10Mx10M matrix every time you pass it to a fn?
[19:07:43] <anomal> You can't copy them either.
[19:07:56] <adder> creating in place = copying
[19:08:09] <Decker> so you can't read them, copy them or move them how do you have any way to interact with them?
[19:08:28] <adder> yeah this is nonsense
[19:08:33] <anomal> Well, you can reach them via their parent
[19:08:37] <adder> where do I apply for getting back last minute of my life
[19:08:53] <anomal> Their parent has access to them. So the parent can delegate messages to them
[19:08:53] <lf94> god
[19:09:14] <anomal> parent as in owner
[19:09:39] <anomal> So we have a chain of owners, and that way until we reach a root
[19:09:48] <anomal> Everyone sees the root.
[19:09:57] <Decker> JS call that 'globalThis'
[19:10:06] <Decker> calls
[19:10:21] <anomal> However there's a twist. When you refer the root, the root sees where in the hierarchy you are.

[19:20:40] <Decker> why does it get permission to get past the pet that others don't?
[19:21:01] <anomal> Decker: it doesn't need to get to itself. It has state which is made of inline values. Like a struct for example

[19:22:47] <Decker> anyway - even langauges like C# and JS that have strong use of references don't move objects anyway; and rarely copy them... 
[19:22:56] <anomal> Decker: I propose we don't make assumptions, let me lay out couple of basic things. When you access the object, subject to this entire scheme, it's about accessing its interface. Which is separate from its state, which is private. The object has access to its state. It doesn't need access to its interface, as its interface is already a projection of its state.
[19:23:00] <ski> jamea : `files.get(0)' ?

[19:25:04] <Decker> anomal right :) except if you need to make a clone/slightly modified version of that value (which is why you need a type of stack for recursion)
[19:25:41] <anomal> Decker: can I start over. I have a better analogy. Let's say an "object" in our case is basically a row in a table. But the row is not accessible outside to others directly, only through a function, that we call the interface of that row.
[19:26:29] <anomal> Decker: and that function is accessible only through the path to that table 
[19:26:45] <anomal> Decker: the path which also calls into the table interface and so on. It's all interfaces
[19:27:32] <anomal> Decker: so everything happens through a hierarchy of functions. State is private
[19:27:32] *** nwulfe is now known as night_wulfe
[19:27:43] <Decker> anomal well... for that sort of object set; I'd expect everything to be mutually reflected so any row can get back to its table, and tables have rows, cells can get to rows, rows can get to other rows through constraints (joins; but in C# dataset, joins are implemented so one row jus treferences another directly without a 'join' sort of operation really)

[19:54:09] <GeDaMo> Yes

[19:54:36] <ski> ok, ty
[19:54:45] <anomal> Decker: it's much harder to do this by accident, rather in some generic ass graph
[19:55:04] <piou> Decker: how is that crazy? There's 0 reason for the misalignment in the first place and it works against learning a keyboard since the association key-finger is not as direct as with an ortholinear keyboard. People use WASD for a reason: although weirdly placed in this case having sort-of aligned keys is useful.
[19:55:07] <anomal> Decker: in a graph it's as easy as     foo.children[0].parent = foo

[20:35:41] <Decker> and that's where it gets to be 'slavery, but with extra steps'   because you're counting on a index of those other thing separate form the data indexed values... which like I said sounds like a foreign key, but if I have A and Afk why can't I just have A.Afk and skip the lookup.... and if it's many to one A.[Afk]  (where A is a data table and Afk is a foreign keyed relation back to A)

[20:43:20] <Decker> because the additional relationship would be an update which would make it a different record in the same object ID; and the foriegn object reference could specify ID and Timestamp version; such that another record could find it wasn't up to date with regards to the other
