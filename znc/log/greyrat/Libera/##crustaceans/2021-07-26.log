[17:43:26] <gwozniak> Once again, the leaf blowers are outside.  I truly detest those things
[18:06:32] <ngoldbaum> lol the irish government has a scheme for getting covid recovery certificates
[18:06:34] <ngoldbaum> except
[18:06:48] <ngoldbaum> they bought a url for it that had a misspelling in it

[18:06:52] <buttsbot> Twatter - gavreilly - The Government has launched a website to allow people claim a Digital Covid Certificate if they have recovered from Covid within the last 180 days: https://t.co/l3Uu8W1FGp
[18:07:01] <ngoldbaum> https://irishcovidcertifcateportal.org/
[18:07:07] <ngoldbaum> certifcate
[18:10:00] <gwozniak> heh
[18:10:04] <gwozniak> whoops!
[18:12:09] <epilys> do the covid certifcates have to spell it that way too now?
[18:12:52] <ngoldbaum> lol and if i actually go there now the ssl cert is bad
[18:18:54] <Brekkjern> Certificate problems, huh?
[18:20:23] <Brekkjern> Why wouldn't they just have set up a subdomain of whatever central health org they have in Ireland?
[18:21:02] <Brekkjern> Not that I should complain as we didn't do that in Norway even, but at least the website is for more than just covid...
[18:22:44] <Brekkjern> In unrelated news, I spent 6 hours of today more or less goofing off at work. The joys of government employment :D
[18:24:39] <epilys> Some manager probably realised they could just register new domains
[18:25:03] <epilys> there's a point in Greek State IT after which new sites appeared on new domains instead of subdomains
[18:25:35] <epilys> you can figure out someone had an "a-ha!" revelation that resulted in 35+ character domains (greek has huge words)
[18:26:03] <Brekkjern> Were they in Greek characters too?
[18:26:31] <epilys> no, ascii (it's called "greeklish")
[18:26:31] <ben> probably transliterated
[18:27:01] <ngoldbaum> i guess most greeks don’t have keyboards with greek characters?
[18:27:04] <ben> you could probably use greek letters via punycode but that's probably jankier
[18:27:52] <epilys> punycode was a usability mistake, it always shows up as junk somewhere in the way
[18:32:08] <Brekkjern> Anything else than UTF8 is a mistake in the modern world
[18:32:44] <Brekkjern> I'm probably missing some use cases, but you make your life so much easier by just supporting it by default...
[18:34:46] <epilys> my hobby OS will include utf8/libicu in its libc
[18:37:49] <Brekkjern> Lawl. Just got shot 2 appointment moved up.
[18:38:32] <Brekkjern> Originally had an appointment in the mid September. Got moved to Wednesday
[18:42:25] <epilys> must feel good Brekkjern
[18:42:28] <epilys> an "adult win"
[18:43:14] <gwozniak> Brekkjern: getting my second shot today, which was originally scheduled for mid-Sept
[18:43:44] <ngoldbaum> nice Brekkjern and gwozniak, hope the side effects aren’t too bad
[18:44:19] <epilys> I got it early, 2 months ago due to disability and side effects were minimal
[18:44:23] <epilys> the flu shot I get every year is worse
[18:46:41] <Brekkjern> I'm looking "forward" to it
[18:47:15] <Brekkjern> It's gonna be good to get it, but I'm not looking forward to the side effects :P
[18:48:44] <epilys> I think no one would pay notice to the usual side effects were it not in the popular discourse
[18:48:55] <gwozniak> I'm curious to see if I have any side effects, tbh
[18:50:33] <Brekkjern> I've heard that it's flu-like symptoms. Probably won't be too bad. I just don't want to be away from work.
[18:53:49] <epilys> For me personally, it was very light local inflammation in the injection site, plus light headache
[18:54:04] <epilys> with the pfizer/biontech
[18:54:11] <Brekkjern> Yeah. I'm not scared of it.
[18:54:43] <Brekkjern> I would just prefer not being sick :P
[18:55:01] <epilys> well that's why you're getting vaccinated isn't it
[18:55:26] <Brekkjern> Trur that
[18:55:30] <Brekkjern> True*
[18:57:46] <Brekkjern> Now to convince my sister to get the second shot...
[18:58:01] <Brekkjern> Fucking vaccine sceptics...
[19:23:26] <gwozniak> Ugh :(
[19:56:22] <cb> i like how the the top post for a little bit was from a b& user
[20:04:31] <indigo> epilys: second shot side effects were pretty intense for me. I took a day off and slept the whole day
[20:04:43] <indigo> I think it varies for everyone
[20:10:11] <gerikson> no side effects for either of my shots, pfizer
[20:11:07] <dasm> Moderna: i imposed side effects on myself. I completely forgot about that I got 2nd, and spent pretty intense day doing a lot of homework/car work. By an evening, I had elevated temp, went asleep, barely slept. The day after was pretty rough, due to lack of sleep. But later -- everything was fine.
[20:12:34] <companion_cube> second shot of moderna knocked me out for a day
[20:13:09] <Brekkjern> I was planning on taking it before lunch, and going to work afterwards :P
[20:13:51] <dasm> Brekkjern: go for it. I had no issues for entire day. Probably it would be nothing, if I wouldn't ask for troubles :P

[20:18:08] <epilys> i use needles every day :x
[20:18:21] <indigo> Right? Hehe
[20:26:39] <wrl> indigo: honestly it's the easiest shot i've ever got
[20:26:43] <wrl> i didn't even feel the needle
[20:33:16] <Xe> indigo: i'm afraid of needles too (blood draws can cause out of body experiences) and the second covid shot is one of the first times in a long time where the color of everything didn't fade to black and white for a moment
[20:33:45] <indigo> Nice!!!

[21:18:19] * gwozniak is now two weeks away from being fully 5G compliant
[21:18:56] <jjuran> Congrats!
[21:20:14] <gwozniak> Now waiting to see if I suffer any side effects
[21:21:26] <jjuran> My fear of needles is completely gone.  I'll watch it go in.
[21:22:47] <gwozniak> I watch every time except today since it was a little awkward to turn my head enough to see it
[21:24:21] <jjuran> Once last year, I had to give myself an injection.  My only fear was accidentally triggering the needle retraction mechanism too early (which I managed not to do).
[21:26:31] <gwozniak> I had a diabetic cat and had to administer shots for a few months, so I got really used to it
[21:27:08] <gwozniak> I was a bit nervous the first couple of shots, but then it soon became second nature
[21:30:40] <jjuran> I became the medical technician for my parents' diabetic cat for the last couple years of its life.
[21:34:13] <jjuran> Pricking the cat's ear to get a drop of blood involves some technique
[21:34:44] <indigo> > If you prick us, do we not bleed?
[21:34:56] <jjuran> That's the idea :-)
[21:36:08] <jjuran> It sure helps if you hold a flat object behind the ear that you can brace with your fingers
[21:36:25] <jjuran> I found my Ripple Labs business cards to be perfect for this
[21:37:07] <jjuran> Nice and thick, I'm guessing 0.5mm at least
[21:37:12] <gwozniak> jjuran: yeah, that was always tricky
[21:37:24] <jjuran> And yes, they even have a watermark ;-)
[22:31:20] <pja> gerikson: I think an Ultra 5 was my first “real work” computer.

[22:33:55] <pja> (Enterprise)

[23:26:08] <ngoldbaum> my first exposure to unix was via a sunray thin client cluster
