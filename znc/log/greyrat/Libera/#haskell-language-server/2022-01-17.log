[21:56:19] <isovector1> could i get some help on https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server/pull/2581 ?
[21:56:47] <isovector1> it's working fine in ghc 9.0, but the compatability shim doesnt compile in 9.2 due to the new annotations on the parse tree stuff
[21:59:22] <isovector1> and not having a 9.2 compiler really makes it painful to iterate on
[22:13:11] <jneira[m]> <isovector1> "and not having a 9.2 compiler..." <- could not you get ghc-9.2.1 via ghcup for example?
[22:14:42] <jneira[m]> maybe alanz  could find some time to take a quick look? üôè 
[22:15:18] <jneira[m]> it wouldbe great to have wingman again for hls-1.6.0 and ghc-9.0.1
[22:15:53] <jneira[m]> i am gonna start the release process, if you want include some pending work, please, let me know!
[22:16:26] <isovector1> like it's working for 9.0. just the 9.2 stuff is getting in the way even though none of this will work on 9.2 anyway
[22:16:38] <isovector1> im more than happy just to comment it out on 9.2
[22:17:31] <isovector1> but i didnt see there's a 9.2 stack so i'll try that
[22:21:41] <isovector1> except that stack 9.2.yaml doesnt build :)

[23:16:41] <jneira[m]> i am just working in a stack-9.2.1.yaml, not sure if i will get it to work without head.hackage though
[23:18:13] <jneira[m]> isovector1: are you usually using stack? not sure if you read this issue about stack.yaml status: https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server/issues/2533
[23:21:45] <jneira[m]> i have the stack-9.2.1.yaml with an error in hls-class-plugin so i almost get it
[23:25:23] <alanz> jneira[m]: what was the question?
[23:26:31] <isovector1> i usually use stack 
[23:26:46] <isovector1> alanz: im trying to get a compatability shim for 9.2 up adn running
[23:27:06] <isovector1> i think i've solved that part. but playing whack a mole between three versions of ghc trying to get wingman building in all of them simultaneously
[23:27:46] <jneira[m]> <isovector1> "could i get some help on https:/..." <- isovector1 asked for help about the new annotations of the ghc parser tree
[23:29:27] <alanz> I could possibly take a look. Currently trying to wrap up the last tests for apply-refact on ghc 9.2.1
[23:33:45] <isovector1> its not exactprint anymore, so much as just wrangling the ifdefs in Compat.Core
[23:33:57] <isovector1> but i can't for the life of me figure it out and i would greatly appreciate a hand :)
[23:35:08] *** Quits: juhp (~juhp@128.106.188.82) (Ping timeout: 250 seconds)
[23:35:14] <alanz> compat is not something I have taken much of a look at.
[23:35:49] <alanz> One trick is to use a hie file to specify cabal, and then compile the project with stack.  So you get two different versions giving feedback at the same time
[23:37:59] <isovector1> yeah
[23:38:05] <isovector1> its just super frustating :)
[23:38:10] <isovector1> because there are 3 versions that are fighting :)
[23:40:10] <michaelpj[m]> shout-out to eddiemundo and @mrgutkun for fixing plugins and flaky tests! champs!
[23:40:41] *** Joins: juhp (~juhp@128.106.188.82)
[23:41:17] <jneira[m]> yeah
[23:41:58] <jneira[m]> <isovector1> "its not exactprint anymore, so..." <- oh, i thought exactprint was somewhat involved :-/
[23:44:07] <isovector1> jneira[m]: it was when i started but your suggestion to get ghc921 running fixed that bit :)
[23:46:40] <alanz> exactprint compiles.  But the GHC 9.2.1 model is very different to earlier ones, because the annotations are all in the AST, no longer separate
