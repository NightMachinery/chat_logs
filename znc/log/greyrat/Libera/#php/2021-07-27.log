[05:25:19] <Byteflux> Blondie101010: Uh, no? THC is a cannabinoid. Cannabinoids are found in cannabis plants. Catnip is not a cannabis plant, not in the same family of plants, not even close.
[05:28:35] <Blondie101010> ok, maybe not, and from what I'm reading right now some say that smoking catnip could be beneficial, soooo  I said nothing

[05:30:54] <Byteflux> The feline endocannabinoid system actually produces a much different experience of THC than in humans. Their experience is definitely not pleasant and they also have a much lower threshold for THC toxicity.
[05:31:10] <Byteflux> Definitely do not give your pets THC, please >_>
[05:31:25] <Byteflux> CBD is another story.
[05:32:17] <Byteflux> It's well tolerated but there's no real evidence to suggest it's beneficial.

[08:20:45] <ericlee> Hi, what's the best module for PHP to write logs? It looks like log4php is deprecated.
[08:25:20] <Blondie101010> "best" is very subjective, but I suggest you look at the popular results and their bug reports on https://packagist.org/search/?query=log
[08:26:22] <Byteflux> I see Monolog being used a lot

[08:33:14] <Byteflux> ericlee: Looks like it's based on PHP 5, I wouldn't use anything that still caters to such an old version
[08:33:21] <Byteflux> PEAR in general probably not so good these days
[08:34:15] <ericlee> roger, so seems Monolog is an option for sure.
[08:34:19] <Byteflux> I'd stick to Packagist like Blondie101010 said. Most projects these days use Composer to manager PHP dependencies and Packagist is the official Composer repository.

[15:56:27] <tester12> I check the log

[15:58:29] <tester12> excuse me, last warning is that
[15:58:37] <tester12> first is imagettftext(): Could not find/open font
[15:58:52] <tester12> should I change font file?
[15:59:02] <tester12> let me try
[16:12:36] <Blondie101010> hmmm...  upgrading php should not remove fonts, so you probably did more than that

[16:22:18] <tester12> I found the problem'
[16:22:45] <Blondie101010> ok, what was it?
[16:23:55] <tester12> in php 7.3 and greater, this matter was Depending on which version of the GD library PHP is using, when fontfile does not begin with a leading / then .ttf will be appended to the filename and the library will attempt to search for that filename along a library-defined font path.
[16:24:33] <tester12> the font file was in same directory but couldnt find it
[16:25:11] <tester12> I use $font=realpath('fontname.ttf'); and solve it
[16:25:23] <stenno> good job figuring it out!
[16:25:56] <Blondie101010> I'm intrigued by that change
[16:26:32] <tester12> why?
[16:26:51] <tester12> is good or bad?
[16:27:14] <stenno> it _sounds_ bad
[16:27:43] <Blondie101010> I don't know where the problem comes from but if your configs haven't change, then the extention had a breaking change
[16:27:59] <tester12> stenno Yes, exactly. I think so
[16:28:04] <Blondie101010> but upgrading can change config files

[18:21:32] <fentanyl> i've tried -r but doing multiple lines is a little pain.

[21:00:37] <TinoDidriksen> utf8_encode() is almost always wrong. It does not do what you think it does.
[21:00:57] <Lvl4Sword> Sure, understandable. I'm not fluent in PHP so :)
[21:01:45] <TinoDidriksen> If you have charset=UTF-8 on everything, then you should never need utf8_encode or _decode.
[21:01:59] <__adrian> Lvl4Sword: charset needs to be right at every step. i.e., the DB, your script, http headers.
[21:02:15] <Sammitch> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/279170/utf-8-all-the-way-through
[21:02:29] <__adrian> (yes, use the <meta charset> tag, but you NEED the http header also.)
[21:02:31] <Lvl4Sword> TinoDidriksen, __adrian Well, I'm using .. gzuncompress(base64_decode()) .. and am trying to disassemble a questionable script
[21:03:00] <TinoDidriksen> In other words, you were hacked and you're trying to fix it?
[21:03:05] <__adrian> (a) there's probably no reason to do that  (b) do you know that the script itself is utf-8 ?
[21:03:21] <Lvl4Sword> Not me, but I'm assisting someone
[21:03:26] <Lvl4Sword> But yes TinoDidriksen
[21:03:29] <__adrian> Lvl4Sword: then STOP
[21:03:31] <__adrian> that'
[21:03:34] <TinoDidriksen> Don't fix. Wipe and restore from backup.
[21:03:37] <__adrian> that's not how you help
[21:03:52] <Lvl4Sword> Well, I'm trying to piece together what it's done. The system's already been wiped.
[21:04:11] <TinoDidriksen> Ah. Anyway, how is UTF-8 related to that?

[21:05:37] <daniel-k7> Is there a php crash course for someone who already knows how to program. I know JS, Python, and Swift best specifically.
[21:05:45] <__adrian> https://php.net
[21:06:06] <__adrian> it's going to be somewhere between js and python
[21:06:27] <__adrian> substantially different from either, but also similar in various ways
[21:07:08] <Sammitch> https://phptherightway.com/
[21:07:12] <__adrian> but if you already know how to write code, then it's mostly going to be an issue of syntax and function reference

[21:08:00] <__adrian> ^^  yep
[21:08:19] <Byteflux> and generally googling "how to XYZ in PHP"
[21:08:27] <Byteflux> probably will get you 80-90% of the way
[21:08:30] <daniel-k7> I assumed so. I can read php code and understand mostly what's happening but some stuff like print, echo, and the general html generation is a little weird for me right now.
[21:08:34] <__adrian> just be careful googling
[21:09:04] <daniel-k7> yea, I've heard that's one place where php is pretty bad compared to others langs
[21:09:28] <__adrian> > html generation  // php is very well-suited to templating. anything outside the <?php  ...  ?> tags is output directly (no processing), as if you'd done  echo "all that";
[21:09:29] <daniel-k7> thanks y'all

[21:10:34] <__adrian> "daniel-k7> yea, I've heard that's one place where php is pretty bad"  php has a low barrier to entry, so it's easy from people who don't know what they're doing to get going. but they also don't know they don't know what they're doing, so they think they do, and write tutorials about it.

[23:05:28] <Sammitch> and using @ to suppress error messages is a great way to have your app break in completely unsolvable ways
[23:05:36] <__adrian> mmm
[23:06:04] <stenno> @ is code smell

[23:18:05] <stenno> actually i am assuming that for some people, @ is a part of what makes php great
[23:22:05] <Sammitch> smelly people
[23:22:40] <Byteflux> indeed, you're smelly
[23:23:59] <Sammitch> yes, but for different reasons.
[23:24:17] <stenno> Sammitch: did you watch nethack ESA stream earlier?
[23:24:53] <Sammitch> I don't understand that combination of words, so probably not
[23:24:57] <stenno> kk
[23:25:09] <stenno> saw a name similar to yours in the twitch chat

[23:26:43] <Sammitch> chances are usually pretty good it's me, but some jerk got my name on twitch before I grudgingly signed up

[23:54:39] <relipse> How does a contractor get health insurance?
[23:54:43] <relipse> and dental?
[23:54:56] <relipse> for family
[23:55:00] <Sammitch> from an insurance company
[23:55:29] <stenno> you forgot to mention that you are a php contractor
[23:55:36] <relipse> yes php
[23:55:49] <stenno> otherwise it would be offtopic here
[23:55:55] <Sammitch> the same way you're responsible for deducting income tax for your pay
