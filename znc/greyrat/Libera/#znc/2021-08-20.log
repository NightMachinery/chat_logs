[00:42:54] <DoctorD90> the hardening one is just a bunch of notes i put while walking on the beach thinking on how to do it moron proof :)

[00:46:20] <predicament> i gotta be at a computer to explain stuff, im not sure why

[00:50:19] <DoctorD90> ????
[00:50:40] <predicament> its a good thing i think

[00:57:21] <predicament> thats for my user cert. its a smaller key.  my other ones were longer keys when it was working before.  they're self-signed and sha512 when i generated them (all, including the one with the sha1 fingerprint.  not sure why it has sha1.  that was this morning
[00:57:46] <predicament> but i didnt restart it yet so i guess thats why
[00:58:43] <predicament> its not "fixed" but now its at least somewhere on the better track.  it does look exactly like the example given, a sha1

[01:13:15] <DoctorD90> be aware that you can reuse the ssl ciphers and protocols directly for apache and Nginx, but there are better guide to configure them instead to follow the ZNC's one. For the Public/private key, it is practically an how-to-guide that could be reused for all OpenSSL word. It is not applicable to SSH but...well...it is OpenSSL :)
[01:24:23] <predicament> you can sorta apply it
[01:25:08] <predicament> like you said, it's openssl

[02:17:46] <DarthGandalf> DoctorD90: did you just told me that 1.1 is on by default?
[02:20:10] <DoctorD90> DarthGandalf, in the page I wrote what it should *be* in next future. Currently I didnt find out the settings in the source code of TLS. I find out only the line in the ChnageLog about the disable of SSL 2 and 3 and allowing *all* Tls 1
[02:20:19] <DoctorD90> but TLS1.1 should be disabled
[02:20:50] <DoctorD90> as I wrote on the page, only TLS 1.2 and 1.3 should be left enabled
[02:21:30] <DoctorD90> I updated the [[Configuration]] SSL Ciphers (adding the one I added to the PR I will submit in next days)
[02:21:31] <ZNC-Linker> https://wiki.znc.in/Configuration
[02:21:43] <DarthGandalf> > The default values are: [snip] -TLSv1.1
[02:22:00] <DarthGandalf> +TLSv1.3 is not even a supported option
[02:22:03] <DarthGandalf> at the time of writing that
[02:22:16] <DoctorD90> Im waiting to find out with you the TLSv1.1 configuration
[02:22:29] <DoctorD90> yeah but if added it seems to work
[02:22:37] <DoctorD90> If you prefer I can remove it
[02:22:41] <DoctorD90> as you like
[02:25:25] <DoctorD90> The CertificateTest is currently self referencing - it doesnt reference to Hardening, so I can release the Hardening in next period as soon the default will be approved :) for the TLSv1.3, it is 'tricky' cause it seems it relays on openssl version in use... I could simply remove the tlsv13 side or comment out (if media wiki allowes it

[19:01:15] <Khaytsus> I suspect the real issue is the VM.  A lot of them aren't set up to allow connections into them from outside.

[19:01:49] <Khaytsus> I've seen folks leave off the port exposing
[19:01:54] <Casper> ESXi -> Docker VM -> Containers. :p
[19:02:42] <Khaytsus> Or also seen people break the docker firewall rules and docker has no networking that works right.
[19:03:42] <Casper> I could try VIC sometime though, but that's all new again >_> 
[19:03:50] <Casper> Heh, indeed.
[19:05:37] <Khaytsus> I even did it myself before, it's easy to do...  Docker just needs a few basic rules, my server I'd re-run the firewall and docker would break.  Finally realized what was going on, restarted it, got the rules in the firewall script..
[19:06:00] <Khaytsus> Now when I re-run the firewall script it also rebuilds the docker rules heh
[19:06:19] <Khaytsus> I suppose podman does not have them... now that I think about it.

[19:43:35] <G-Flex> I'm kind of curious what a connection to ZNC looks like from the client's perspective. Does it still see the individual servers as "servers" and so on?
[19:43:51] <G-Flex> thinking about switching from Quassel because I'd like to use a client that can actually render text properly

[19:45:32] <bookworm> you'll need a separate connection to znc from your client per upstream IRC server
[19:45:49] <bookworm> so in that sense, znc just pretends to be a normal IRC server
[19:49:35] <G-Flex> oh, so znc is essentially pretending to be *multiple* servers
[19:49:44] <G-Flex> i.e. your client is connecting to it multiple times
[19:49:46] <G-Flex> that makes sense
[19:51:05] <G-Flex> my other question was how backlog fetching works. I know it can send some backlog to the client, but wouldn't that mess with the client's timestamps, since as far as the client knows, they're new messages?

[20:09:31] <bookworm> G-Flex: ircv3 has a capability that fixes this issue, "server-time". Most clients can cope with that.

[20:09:55] <G-Flex> Does that work in practice, though, with most IRC servers and clients?
[20:09:58] <bookworm> yes?
[20:10:10] <G-Flex> that's good. I have no idea how common IRCv3 features are these days

[21:10:22] <MetaNova> DoctorD90: you wish to list listening ports?
[21:12:58] <DoctorD90> MetaNova, Im continuing with Hardening, and one step is enable sl ports and disable the not ssl :) so...in the end I find out the command :D I dont play with partyline commands by 1 year :P
[21:13:18] <DoctorD90> it would be interesting if SSLCiphers could be setuped via partyline
[21:14:06] <MetaNova> I don't see how partyline factors into this
[21:14:14] <MetaNova> partyline hasn't worked correctly since 1.0
[21:14:33] <MetaNova> it was finally and fully deprecated in 1.7 I think
[21:14:53] <MetaNova> DoctorD90: /msg *status listports
[21:15:10] <MetaNova> if you wanted a means of quickly verifying you don't have any listening ports which are not using SSL
[21:16:23] <DoctorD90> sorry MetaNova but /msg *status things, wasnt called partyline? :P Maybe I said a stupid stuff (btw, yeah, that's the command to list, and addport and del port :D
[21:17:16] <MetaNova> no
[21:17:48] <MetaNova> partyline was its own module, intended for ZNC user-to-user communication without the need for an IRC server
[21:17:55] <DoctorD90> ok so I called /msg *status - partyline xD
[21:18:02] <DoctorD90> ooooooo!!! I used it xD
[21:18:08] <DoctorD90> it was so cool :P
[21:18:11] <MetaNova> well, you shouldn't call *status partyline
[21:18:17] <MetaNova> because partyline is its own thing
[21:18:28] <DoctorD90> MetaNova, but why you guys do not run a bounce service?
[21:18:37] <MetaNova> define "you guys"
[21:18:42] <MetaNova> us here in #znc?
[21:18:47] <MetaNova> us here behind the wiki?
[21:18:54] <DoctorD90> znc is nowadays fully known
[21:19:04] <DoctorD90> you = the devs team
[21:19:15] <MetaNova> the "dev team" is quite small
[21:19:24] <DoctorD90> I was thinking about it last nigth
[21:19:37] <MetaNova> and, more to the point, there are plenty of us who either run our own public bouncers, or help run one (or more)
[21:19:38] <DoctorD90> you own znc. You can just give it as service
[21:19:42] <MetaNova> see [[Providers]]
[21:19:42] <ZNC-Linker> https://wiki.znc.in/Providers
[21:19:50] <DoctorD90> ah ok :D
[21:20:21] <DoctorD90> OGN??????
[21:20:24] <MetaNova> I help run two on that list. I know the owners of TechnoFAQZNC and IRCNow and the owner of yet another one that isn't listed
[21:20:33] <DoctorD90> omg.. xD 
[21:21:03] <DoctorD90> is still running?? (OGN network I mean)
[21:21:26] <MetaNova> huh. the link, http://wiki.onlinegamesnet.net/wiki/Bouncer is 404
[21:21:33] <MetaNova> so, maybe not
[21:21:35] <DoctorD90> ogn is probably out of date....it should be down by many years
[21:21:41] <DoctorD90> I sold znc there xD
[21:22:40] <DoctorD90> Im going to remove it...
[21:22:44] <MetaNova> I just did
[21:23:02] <DoctorD90> ...you beat me ahahah
[21:23:55] <MetaNova> besides, I think it's a good thing there is no "official ZNC service"
[21:24:05] <DoctorD90> oh really?
[21:24:33] <DoctorD90> it would be an easy way to get back a couple of buckets from something that dev team run by many years
[21:24:39] <DoctorD90> btw
[21:24:54] <DoctorD90> it is just my own idea :P I come back to hardening :P
[21:25:04] <MetaNova> it encourages people to use the services that already exist, to try to administer ZNC on their own (a good learning experience), and it prevents any sort of pressure to help run a ZNC service if you merely want to contribute otherwise (the wiki, here in-channel, etc)
[21:25:22] <MetaNova> besides, running a bouncer can be a major headache. no one should feel pressured into doing that
[21:34:45] <DoctorD90> I can understand the point :)

[22:05:19] <DoctorD90> (even if I choose to do not run SSL port, it creates znc.pem for latter usage. It is a nice solution :D but I have to understand the behaviour without SSL support

[22:18:59] <MetaNova> DoctorD90: are you asking, how to specifically compile ZNC without SSL support?
[22:19:51] <MetaNova> it seems like you're asking two different things
[22:20:01] <MetaNova> the first being, how to tell ZNC not to compile with SSL support
[22:20:12] <MetaNova> and the second, how does ZNC behave when it is not compiled with SSL support
[22:20:20] <MetaNova> the latter I know off the top of my head
[22:20:36] <MetaNova> outbound connections to destination networks will fail if an SSL port is specified
[22:20:55] <MetaNova> and listening ports will simply ignore the SSL option, forcing non-SSL listening ports

[22:27:16] <DoctorD90> moreover, I think there is a bug  :P it is possible to delete ALL active ports xD
[22:27:28] <DoctorD90> I ended up in a ZNC not listening ahahah
[22:27:52] <DoctorD90> should be there a check if 1 single port exists at least

[23:08:32] <DoctorD90> I didnt find out any open issue about it
[23:08:39] <DoctorD90> whats up with yout vps?
[23:08:57] <MetaNova> I broke python :x
[23:09:10] <MetaNova> and now I can't install/uninstall/reinstall it
[23:09:38] <MetaNova> but this is Ubuntu 16.04 and I've already purchased a new VPS intended to replace it so I'm not terribly worried
[23:10:14] <DoctorD90> lol
[23:11:52] <DoctorD90> for delport Id do a pull request but I dont know how to count available listeners...it is an "if (count(listeners) == 1) {print no} {delport}"
[23:12:01] <DoctorD90> but I dont know how to achieve it :P
[23:12:20] <MetaNova> mmm. I'm afraid I'm still no help there -- I'm not a dev

[23:13:31] <MetaNova> no worries
[23:13:46] <MetaNova> it's not an unfair (or uncommon) assumption

[23:15:14] <MetaNova> I've taken classes in assembly, java, c, c++ and .. perl, I think
[23:15:58] <MetaNova> so I understand certain concepts and if I'm hard-pressed I can edit someone else's script (sometimes) but otherwise I just don't have the energy to fully learn a language and then utilize it

[23:21:26] <DoctorD90> more or less Im the same, but C is totally out of my knowledge
[23:21:57] <MetaNova> but, yes, I also think *using* ZNC is easy, but that's mostly because I'm so familiar with it
