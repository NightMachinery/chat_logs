[17:23:36] <bookworm> I'm the kind of person who likes to tinker with their OS
[17:23:44] <bookworm> and apple is very much the wrong OS for that
[17:23:58] <bookworm> you either like it as it comes out of the box and then it's great or joke's on you
[17:25:18] <bookworm> but as for blowing my computer away, that's not hard considering that it's a ~2 year old Ultrabook meant for portability rather than specs üòú
