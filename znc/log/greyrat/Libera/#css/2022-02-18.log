[15:52:38] <pavonia> lara99: If you want the image outside of the text area, you should probably add a pseudo element using ::before

[15:57:15] <pavonia> I don't think you can with that markup
[15:58:27] <lara99> pavonia: I cannot use p:not(img)?
[15:58:47] <pavonia> You can, but it doesn't do what you want :p
[15:59:33] <pavonia> There's no way to target and element while also defining a filter for descendants of that element
[16:00:47] <lara99> ok... some alternative idea to obtain that?
[16:01:29] <pavonia> I'd use jQuery
[16:03:29] <lara99> ok
[16:13:36] <hmw[at]> wot
[16:13:47] <hmw[at]> recommends jQuery? Is this 2005?
[16:14:34] <lara99> hmw[at]: are there alternatives?
[16:14:50] <hmw[at]> If any script, then JS. jQuery is a bit outdated
[16:14:59] <hmw[at]> I am trying to read back, stand by
[16:16:00] <hmw[at]> so you want to add an image above each <p>. Shoudn't be too hard.
[16:16:32] <lara99> yes but not in the tag that includes an img
[16:17:25] <hmw[at]> I am not sure about the :not selector, it might not yet have been implemented. There is other ways, like first-child to get around that
[16:17:53] <lara99> how?
[16:18:10] <hmw[at]> I'll whip up an example
[16:21:03] <hmw[at]> lara99: Something along these lines: https://jsfiddle.net/u1cvt4ok/
[16:22:57] <hmw[at]> the last 2 rules "undo" the image stuff. If you have several paragraphs with images, this will probably be a suboptimal way to select those. I don't know any good ways with pure CSS to do this. One way could be to use JS to go through all <p> and add a class name, if they have an img inside.
[16:26:35] <lara99> hmw[at]: I have tested it and it works but not for the img because there are more p with it inside
[16:27:06] <hmw[at]> lara99: Some JS for you, that searches all img tags, and if their immediate parent is a <p>, that p gets a class added
[16:27:07] <hmw[at]> https://jsfiddle.net/u1cvt4ok/1/
[16:28:27] <lara99> they are wordpress posts with images between the text
[16:29:19] <hmw[at]> Are my CSS and JS clear to you so far?
[16:31:07] <lara99> I have seen them yes and I thank you but I do not know if adding javascript is a solution that I can pursue
[16:31:12] <hmw[at]> I am not sure, how that wordpress thing you mentioned affects the issue at hand. You can tweak the JS to "filter" correctly for basically any combination. My example with the JS will add a class to any <p><img>, even if there is text and other things in them. You can use that class name for the "undoing"
[16:32:01] <hmw[at]> I see. I personally like pure CSS solutions better too. I think it cannot be done, but my CSS is a little rusty. You can stick around and wait for other users to ask about it.
[16:32:34] <lara99> wait a second... probably the image has a class
[16:32:48] <hmw[at]> We need to select the <p> though
[16:33:16] <hmw[at]> checking if the :not pseudo class is a thing yet
[16:33:54] <lara99> the img has classes but not the p
[16:34:43] <hmw[at]> Yeah, that won't help us much. Apparently the :not selector is a thing. https://css-tricks.com/almanac/selectors/n/not/

[16:50:55] <hmw[at]> Good :) Then, happy avataring!
[16:56:49] <hmw[at]> lara99: About jQuery: JS has matured a lot and we don't need jQuery anymore, you can do everything in native JS now. Also, if you're not already comfortable with coding in JS, jQuery will not really help a lot, because it adds a layer of complexity. But then, you wouldn't need it, because you already can use JS.
[16:58:45] <nbjoerg> well, assuming you don't care about ancient browsers
[16:59:10] <hmw[at]> lol
[16:59:32] <hmw[at]> super ancient. How about polyfills? Wouldn't those add all the functionality?
[16:59:49] <nbjoerg> not sure there are good polyfils for the css emulations
[16:59:58] <hmw[at]> i see
[17:00:20] <nbjoerg> I'm not disagreeing that jQuery is obsolete, but "can do it natively" needs the qualifier :)
[17:00:27] <hmw[at]> right
[17:00:33] <hmw[at]> lara99:  ^
[17:01:01] <lara99> is it possible?
[17:01:17] <hmw[at]> no, just some info about jQuery for very old browsers
[17:02:15] <lara99> I was looking at :nth-child() but it seems not supported
[17:02:45] <hmw[at]> nth-child works fine
[17:03:19] <hmw[at]> if you know beforehand, which <p> has the img, you can safely use it. It is a bit ugly though, you never know, what the content writers may change later on.
[17:03:29] <nbjoerg> what is the current problem we are discussing?
[17:03:37] <nbjoerg> sorry, big wall of text
[17:03:38] <hmw[at]> selecting all p unless they have img inside
[17:04:01] <hmw[at]> a non-js solution would be preferred
[17:04:12] <hmw[at]> they might get away with using :nth-child though
[17:04:16] <nbjoerg> I don't think that can be done in pure CSS
[17:04:25] <hmw[at]> yeah, that was established

[17:04:53] <nbjoerg> as in: it can't be done because you can't do a selection in CSS and then pick the parent
[17:05:34] <lara99> I am seeing that the images are in 90% of the cases the first and the last paragraphs
[17:05:42] <hmw[at]> There could be a :has selector, but the browser makers are hesistant to implement it due to the heavy performance penalties, it would imply
[17:06:01] <hmw[at]> lara99: If it is a 90% situation, my recommendation is the JS solution.
[17:06:33] <hmw[at]> As everyone knows, coding CSS is all about preventing headaches.
[17:06:40] <nbjoerg> basically, run a loop once in JS to add a class to the <p>
[17:06:45] <nbjoerg> everything else is in CSS
[17:06:49] <hmw[at]> did exactly that :)
[17:07:21] <hmw[at]> If you know for sure, that it is always the nth paragraph, you could hard code it, but meh. Not so good.
[17:08:24] <nbjoerg> also, the speach bubble effect can likely be optained with some clear use of a linear-gradient
[17:09:13] <nbjoerg> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42992594/css-custom-shape-having-angled-borders might give you an idea on how to build it
[17:09:16] <hmw[at]> CSS speech bubbles are fun :) I wish, I had more than only ::before and ::after. My thinking bubble has only 2 circles, when I wanted 3
[17:10:10] <nbjoerg> hmw[at]: multiple radial-gradients should make that possible?
[17:10:32] <hmw[at]> huh. interesting. Not sure yet, how specifically, but neat idea
[17:10:56] <nbjoerg> same idea as how they build the angular blocks in above
[17:11:27] <lara99> ok
[17:12:19] <hmw[at]> oh, that is looking very promising. Thanks for the hint!
