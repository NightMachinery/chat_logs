[10:37:46] <Mudskipper875[m]> How to you transfer Firefox profiles/settings to a new system?
[10:38:30] <Mudskipper875[m]> Is it enough to just copy the `.mozilla` or `.librewolf` directory?
[11:14:31] <Arya[m]> .mozilla and .cache/mozilla
[11:14:46] <Arya[m]> but before that u need to close firefox safely or whatever
[11:14:55] <Arya[m]> or else it may get corrupted
[11:15:28] <Arya[m]> most of this applies to chromium too
[11:15:43] <Arya[m]> Arya[m]: if you want to prserve your lgins .cache
[11:30:29] <Mudskipper875[m]> <Arya[m]> "if you want to prserve your..." <- Oh
