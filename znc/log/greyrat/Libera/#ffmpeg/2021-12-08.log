[02:27:00] <bobof> hi, I'm trying to do something which would seem simple but failing miserably; I'd like to make an MKV with an own created TrueHD audio track from a wav file.  The mkvs resulting seem unplayable with the truehd audio; any clues?
[02:27:31] *** Joins: isamiamsam (~d@149.56.44.185)
[02:28:00] <isamiamsam> this url works in ffplay but i can't get it to save with ffmpeg:  ffplay https://azuracast.tilderadio.org/radio/8000/radio.ogg
[02:28:57] <isamiamsam> i'm just using 'ffmpeg -i https://azuracast.tilderadio.org/radio/8000/radio.ogg radio.mkv' and i get error 'radio.mkv: Transport endpoint is not connected'
[02:30:40] <bobof> I did : "ffmpeg.exe -i 48k.wav -c:a truehd -strict -2 48k.thd" and followed by: "ffmpeg -i 48k.thd -i p3v2020_h_1000.mp4 -acodec copy p3thd.mkv", but the mkv with truehd seems unplayable on any player...

[02:55:20] <emcodem> @bobof i never tried truehd but it is in general a good advice not to write raw files to disk first and in a second step mux them
[02:57:14] <bobof> thanks @emcodem, trouble is I'm a little bit of a newb and struggling with the syntax to get it all done in one go.  I was making the video from a single frame, which seems fine, but I couldn't quite figure out where to add the audio file
[03:01:16] <emcodem> maybe try something like ffmpeg.exe -i 48k.wav -c:a truehd -strict -2 -i p3v2020_h_1000.mp4 -map 1:v -map 0:a p3thd.mkv
[03:03:00] <bobof> i'll give it a go, thanks
[03:03:53] <emcodem> probably better like this: ffmpeg.exe -i 48k.wav -i p3v2020_h_1000.mp4 -c:a truehd -strict -2  -map 1:v -map 0:a p3thd.mkv

[03:07:03] <emcodem> @isamiamsam your cmd works for me, dunno whats your problem unfortunately
[03:09:25] <furq> bobof: does that mp4 have an audio track
[03:09:34] <furq> if so it's probably taking precedence since you're not using -map
[03:09:46] <bobof> thanks emcodem, was worth a try but the files seem to suffer the same fate.  There must be something slightly off about them, as various MKV tools will show there is a truehd track in there, but nothing will play it
[03:09:52] <furq> nvm then
[03:09:56] <bobof> @furq, no it does not
[03:10:20] <furq> ffmpeg truehd works for me in mpv at least
[03:10:23] <bobof> it's not a matter of the audio not playing, the entire video is rendered unplayable it seems
[03:10:24] <furq> i don't have any other players to test on

[03:16:02] <bobof> yes, mpv plays them fine furq.  I guess there is a difference of opinion as to what is needed to constitute a valid file....

[03:19:19] <emcodem> good joke @bobof ;-) ...it always was like differnt decoders support different flavours of the different formats :D
[03:20:46] <bobof> I guess I need to work out what secret sauce the two players I'm trying to get to work need... infuse on TVOS and an Oppo UHD player
[03:20:53] <bobof> neither will play the files at the moment

[03:22:45] <emcodem> maybe the players just don't support the mkv version really? so a container change does it?
[03:23:04] <emcodem> i don't think that it's about some issue with the audio codec per se
[03:23:22] *** Quits: Buster_ (~Buster@buster-net.ru) (Ping timeout: 265 seconds)
[03:23:52] <bobof> yes, might well be the MKV container isn't right or doesn't have the right bits for some reason.  the players play all my BD / UHD disk rips from makemkv fine.
[03:24:02] <bobof> (with truehd sound)
[03:24:31] <emcodem> hm well such stuff is not really fun to debug
[03:25:16] <bobof> it is what it is...   I will have a play.
[03:27:08] <emcodem> have fun

[15:13:44] <Atsuko> what is an intermediary format i can use that can be cat together and then encoded to flac?

[15:17:26] <BtbN> Use a rf64 wav, if you don't care about compatibility.
[15:17:33] <Atsuko> merging the 3x input .m2ts files with tsmuxer and then encoding the audio to flac that way breaks also
[15:18:13] <Atsuko> how can i do that with ffmpeg BtbN?
[15:18:17] <Atsuko> ffmpeg -i F:\BDMV\STREAM\00002.m2ts -map 0:1 -acodec pcm_s24le 1.rf64 ?
[15:18:37] *** Quits: darkapex (~darkapex@user/darkapex) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[15:19:38] <BtbN> -rf64 auto or always
[15:20:48] <Atsuko> ffmpeg -i F:\BDMV\STREAM\00002.m2ts -map 0:1 -acodec pcm_s24le -rf64 auto 1.wav
[15:20:57] <Atsuko> this is outputting a 30mb file
[15:21:48] <BtbN> The limit is 4GB or something, so you don't need it for that small of a file
[15:22:01] <Atsuko> yeah the output is bad
[15:22:07] <BtbN> also, -acodec is deprecated, use -c:a
[15:22:07] <Atsuko> output will be over 4gb

[23:36:42] <powerman2206> Does AC3 just not support language metadata? I can't get it to work properly
[23:37:41] <kepstin> language metadata is normally a property stored in the container you're storing the audio stream in, not the stream itself
[23:38:01] <powerman2206> I'm doing something wrong, then
[23:38:07] *** Joins: berndj-blackout (~berndj@ns1.linksynergy.co.za)
[23:39:21] <JEEB> I think technically AC-3 streams can have a language field
[23:39:28] <JEEB> I'm just not sure how well that works with containers
[23:39:35] <JEEB> since most containers have a way to set their own language code
[23:39:43] <JEEB> or well, identifier
[23:39:44] *** Joins: bencoh_ (~bencoh@nautica.notk.org)
[23:39:53] <powerman2206> So doing something like `ffmpeg -i audio.ac3 -metadata:s:a:0 language=eng -c:a copy out.ac3` *should* make mpv/"any media player" recognise it as English?
[23:40:14] *** Joins: tyep_ (~hatseflat@hatsuseno.rootaccess.nl)
[23:40:26] <JEEB> OK, I just looked at the AC-3 encoder (not the "format writer" if there is such), and that one just sets no language code, hard-coded
[23:40:32] <JEEB> > put_bits(&s->pb, 1, 0);         /* no lang code */
[23:40:42] <powerman2206> Curses
[23:40:56] <JEEB> in your case it wouldn't even be encoded since you're doing packet copy
[23:41:04] <kepstin> powerman2206: that command you have worked if you were muxing the audio into, say, and mp4 or mkv file
[23:41:12] <kepstin> would have worked*
[23:41:24] <powerman2206> You see, that's the problem
[23:41:26] <JEEB> it's in the audio frame headers apparently and since the encoder is writing those, I'd say that the "ac3" output format is just throwing those packets out
[23:41:35] <powerman2206> I am doing that, it's not working
[23:42:15] <JEEB> I know that matroska might in some cases ignore/skip "eng" since that is the default or whatever, I don't recall what that mess was about
[23:42:25] <JEEB> for mp4 I don't think there was anything like that
[23:42:32] <JEEB> and the mp4 language identifiers are pretty standard

[23:44:49] <powerman2206> kepstin: The actual command I'm using is something along the lines of `ffmpeg -i in.mkv -i aud.ac3 -map 0 -map 1:a:0 -metadata:s:a:1 title="English AC3" -metadata:s:a:1 language=eng -c copy -y out.mkv`
[23:45:34] <JEEB> do you have two audio streams there in the output?
[23:46:12] <powerman2206> Yes
[23:46:19] <JEEB> ok, then that makes sense
[23:46:29] <JEEB> and you should see the metadata entries in the Output: portion streams
[23:46:44] <powerman2206> See, that's the thing
[23:46:45] <JEEB> that way you know that the metadata has been mapped to those output streams on the framework level
[23:47:27] <powerman2206> Under the AC3's properties I see in `ffprobe out.mkv`, the `LANGUAGE: eng` thingy is there
[23:47:30] <powerman2206> But in a wrong way
[23:47:53] <JEEB> no I mean in your ffmpeg.c line, it literally lists the output streams and the format etc
[23:48:56] <powerman2206> I'm lost, what?
[23:49:20] <JEEB> when you utilize ffmpeg.c (the ffmpeg cli app), you will get one set of info for Input(s) and another for Output(s)
[23:49:31] <JEEB> the streams under those listings will have the metadata applied listed there
[23:49:42] <JEEB> even more will be shown with `-v verbose`
[23:49:54] <JEEB> you can thus observe that your "language: XYZ" got applied
[23:50:00] <JEEB> to the correct stream, etc
[23:50:39] <powerman2206> Yes, it did
[23:50:51] <powerman2206> But- look, I think I sent this here a few days ago
[23:50:53] <powerman2206> https://termbin.com/x2m4
[23:51:36] <JEEB> I'd start with the ffmpeg.c commands full terminal output, `-v verbose` added

[23:52:08] <JEEB> then we move to the next thing in line
[23:52:46] <furq> powerman2206: langauge
[23:52:51] <JEEB> for the record, FFmpeg does not write language as a random tag, but instead as a track language entry
[23:53:08] <JEEB> so that LANGAUGE most likely came from somewhere else
[23:53:20] <powerman2206> furq: what?
[23:53:22] <JEEB> possibly copied into the output, but if you have set the language metadata properly - that's not it
[23:53:30] <furq> you spelled language wrong in that paste
[23:53:38] <JEEB> anyways, please start with the ffmpeg.c command's full log, `-v verbose`
[23:53:41] <furq> that's probably why it added it as a tag
[23:53:49] <JEEB> so we can verify that things are as expected
[23:53:53] <JEEB> pastebin or whatever it
[23:53:54] <JEEB> gist
[23:53:55] <powerman2206> oh my fucking-
[23:53:59] <JEEB> and link it here
[23:54:24] <powerman2206> That was it
[23:54:27] <powerman2206> furq: that was it
[23:54:31] <JEEB> because if the ffmpeg.c commands terminal output in the Output section does not contain a language
[23:54:35] <JEEB> then you have not set it correctly
[23:54:38] <JEEB> and you do not have to look further
[23:54:42] <JEEB> great that you found your typo
[23:55:11] <powerman2206> Welp now I feel stupid, but I guess that's a regular thing here
[23:55:13] <JEEB> just for the future, start with checking your Output: section
[23:55:36] <JEEB> not everything is shown there but as you can see languages most definitely are
[23:55:44] <JEEB> as well as various metadata fields
[23:56:10] <powerman2206> Oh also another thing
[23:57:12] <powerman2206> Between the Japanese audio (`#0:1`) and the just-added English one (`#0:5`) there are some subtitle streams, can I make the English audio kinda tuck itself into `#0:2` so that the subtitle streams move over by +1?
[23:57:43] <furq> -map 0:v -map 0:a -map 0:s
[23:58:07] <furq> or i guess your maps are more complicated than that but it'll map in the order you set them on the command line
[23:58:18] <powerman2206> o
[23:58:23] <powerman2206> That's interesting, thanks
[23:58:25] <furq> hence 1:a ending up last
[23:59:33] <powerman2206> Yep, that did it
[23:59:36] <powerman2206> Thanks again
