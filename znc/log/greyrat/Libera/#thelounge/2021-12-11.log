[00:13:02] <fnutt> phat: Tell Apple to support web standards in Safari, e.g web push.
[00:13:10] <mouses> phat: unsure if supported, but I just use web push
[00:13:21] <mouses> knowing apple they are waiting to reinvent it and charge you $499 for it
[00:13:51] <fnutt> You can hack it though.... Use ZNC in front of The Lounge and add https://github.com/jreese/znc-push
[00:13:55] <mouses> phat: i'd bet you could do something with puu.sh or a similar service, but have no idea what the apple landscape is like
[00:14:04] <mouses> fnutt: oh thats smart

[00:14:49] <mouses> fnutt: I also use znc behind the lounge for a couple quality of life things (mostly when I need to reboot or mess with lounge config or reboot the server it runs on, the users stay logged in and authed)
[00:15:05] <fnutt> ok

[15:17:51] <thelounge5010> Hi everybody. I have an issue trying to use TheLounge. As specified in the documentation I try to add a custom CSS. So I added this in the settings: 
[15:17:51] <thelounge5010> onServerStart(thelounge) {
[15:17:51] <thelounge5010>     thelounge.Stylesheets.addFile("file.css");
[15:17:51] <thelounge5010>   }
[15:17:51] <thelounge5010> But when I launch it the server give me an error: Unknown key "onServerStart", please verify your config.
[15:17:51] <thelounge5010> Is it something I didn't understand?
[15:17:52] <thelounge5010> Thanks in advance
[15:18:47] <thelounge5010> (I precise I'm using the last dockerized version)

[19:11:57] <thelounge8360> I have a last question (sorry I discover TheLounge I'm still a begginer on it) I'm creating a theme and I want to use other files as described in the documentation. So in my package.json I did this:
[19:11:58] <thelounge8360> "thelounge": {
[19:11:58] <thelounge8360>     "name": "mytheme",
[19:11:58] <thelounge8360>     "type": "theme",
[19:11:58] <thelounge8360>     "css": "theme.css",
[19:11:58] <thelounge8360>     "themeColor": "#303e4a",
[19:11:58] <thelounge8360>     "files": [
[19:11:59] <thelounge8360>       "myfile.png"
[19:11:59] <thelounge8360>     ]
[19:12:00] <thelounge8360>   },
[19:12:00] <thelounge8360> In the CSS I used content: url("/packages/mytheme/myfile.png");
[19:12:01] <thelounge8360> But in the chrome console I got a 404 error saying this image is not accessible.
[19:12:01] <thelounge8360> Any idea?
