[18:13:08] <xx> how come when I do `git cherry-pick HASH` it applies that one commit, but when I do `git cherry-pick START..END` it applies it from START+1?
[18:14:08] <ikke> xx: START..END specifies a range where START is not included
[18:14:40] <xx> a bit counterintuitive, isn't it?
[18:14:49] <ikke> START..END is syntactic sugar for ^START END, where it includes everything reachable by END, but then excludes everything reachable by START
[18:15:09] <xx> hmm, that makes it a bit clearer, thanks
[18:15:18] <ikke> xx: it's consistent with how git log and other things work
[18:15:37] <xx> not consistent with how my brain works though, but that's a bug on my end :)

[18:48:57] <teut> https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/syncing-a-fork   guess I need this
[18:49:26] <mackerman> That's not any different than adding the remote as suggested.
[18:50:49] <teut> Syncing a fork from the web UI     <-- there are people who like UI's  , hes that kind
[18:50:54] <teut> I like the shell
[18:52:32] <mackerman> A merge from an upstream remote is  not a pull request, whatever tool is used.
[18:53:02] <teut> ya ya the goal is not to make a pull request
[18:53:16] <teut> the goal is him able to merge my master branch
[18:53:26] <mackerman> <teut> and now he says send me a pull requst
[18:54:15] <teut> yes thats true because pull request in layman's terms is "merge my changes"
[18:54:31] <teut> and thats the effect he wants
[18:55:41] <mackerman> You can rebase your branch on top of an upstream branch.
[18:56:10] <mackerman> Then pull request your branch vs theirs.
[18:56:38] <teut> my branch is that upstream branch
[18:57:04] <mackerman> Then have them do the rebase.
[18:57:05] <teut> I did not know the word "upstream" 's meaning than today
[18:57:39] <teut> yes, I ll try
[18:57:50] <mackerman> upstream is not special to git, but its a common convention for a remote repo this was forked from.
[18:58:10] <teut> so what command should they write?   git fetch  //my repo url
[18:58:27] <mackerman> https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/configuring-a-remote-for-a-fork
[18:58:56] <mackerman> git fetch upstream
[18:58:58] <teut> this i already know how to add remote, i see you didnt read the conversation above
[18:59:34] <teut> ok so first he ll have to setup the remote as usual
[19:00:22] <mackerman> git rebase upstream/<branch>
[19:00:57] <teut> when I fork a repo, is the "upstream" remote setup by default?
[19:01:03] <mackerman> No.
[19:01:13] <teut> why not?
[19:01:27] <mackerman> git has no concept of fork, that's a GitHub thing.
[19:01:29] <teut> looks to me quite usual that one would require ir
[19:01:30] <teut> it
[19:01:36] <teut> ok
[19:02:35] <mackerman> Also, in some use cases your fork  diverges permanently, and you never touch  upstream again.
[19:02:35] <teut> ya , I need to use  bitbucket, gitlab etc maybe to understand what is role of github in git

[19:03:42] <teut> a contributor wants to go a different way than the repo owner
[19:03:44] <mackerman> git lets you setup as many remotes as you need.
[19:04:10] <teut> and github/lab   allows to setup remote
[19:05:27] <mackerman> The default origin remote is a special case,  as working with the repo you cloned from is very common.

[19:06:23] <ikke> At $work we never use forks
[19:06:36] <ikke> Everone just collaborates on the same project
[19:06:41] <teut> so  you clone from a common link
[19:07:02] <teut> push to  that one guys remote who is the tech lead
[19:07:06] <teut> kind of that?
[19:07:17] <ikke> projects typically have one or more maintainers

[19:07:29] <teut> yes I know we are doing it wrong
[19:07:36] <mackerman> There is more than one way to do it.

[19:08:41] <ikke> teut: you _are_ getting industry experience ;-)
[19:09:02] <teut> :') :')
[19:09:16] <ikke> another|: usually they can just get added as developers
[19:09:38] <mackerman> If you have  access to push to a branch in "the" remote repository, same one as boss, you don't need  seperate forked repo.
[19:09:46] <another|> ikke: ok. that does not match every use case though ;)
