[07:43:54] <theholyduck> and then went to 4g
[07:43:55] <MootPoot> at least in my expeirience, 3g->4g was an exercise in "bigger status icon better"

[07:45:14] <amigojapan> MootPoot: but what do you need such fast speed on a cell phone for?
[07:45:16] <theholyduck> MootPoot:  so sure from 56 to 100 isnt that big a jump
[07:45:16] <MootPoot> like super dense mesh networking and enabling really accurate gps
[07:45:20] <theholyduck> but from 7 to 1000 is a massive
[07:45:26] <theholyduck> er
[07:45:28] <theholyduck> 7 to 100 
[07:45:37] <theholyduck> also again some 4g standards do a lot better than 1000
[07:45:38] <theholyduck> er
[07:45:40] <theholyduck> 100
[07:45:46] * MootPoot pets theholyduck 
[07:46:00] <JesseDesu> we should be talking about huge anime tiddies
[07:46:06] <theholyduck> MootPoot:  basicly if you lived in a city or something odds are you got several generations of upgrades on the cellphone network
[07:46:12] <theholyduck> all marked as "3g"
[07:46:16] <MootPoot> I've said this multiple times, the point of 5g is not enabling existing things to go faster
[07:46:27] <MootPoot> the point of 5g is enabling new features and services to exist
[07:46:28] <JesseDesu> MULTIPLE TIMES
[07:46:54] <MootPoot> looking at 5g with the mindset of "I need my twitter to load faster" is the wrong approach imo
[07:46:55] <theholyduck> MootPoot:  eh. 
[07:47:08] <theholyduck> the point of 5g is a list of requirements any technology needs to support
[07:47:13] <theholyduck> to be called 5g
[07:47:25] <theholyduck> in this case 20gbit downlink. 10gbit uplink. 
[07:47:28] <MootPoot> stuff like cm level accurate gps for delivery drones and self driving cars
[07:47:29] <MootPoot> etc etc
[07:47:30] <amigojapan> MootPoot: I would be happy if maybe I could stop using my home ISP and just rely on 5g, but that is still too expensive
[07:47:41] <JesseDesu> fighter pilots can handle 9G for only a short amount of time
[07:47:42] <theholyduck> MootPoot: i dont tihnk thats part of the spec at all
[07:47:42] <theholyduck> :P

[08:02:06] <MootPoot> tell you what
[08:02:11] <JesseDesu> i was a messenger in san francisco for several years, i used a paper map for most of it
[08:02:12] <MootPoot> I'll give you a paper map
[08:02:28] <MootPoot> and send you to the mall in the capital city of my province
[08:02:33] <MootPoot> its the biggest mall in north america

[08:03:04] <ButterNoodle> they get all stuck in my teef
[08:03:31] <JesseDesu> paper maps have an index of all the streets and a alphabet/numeral grid system to help you zero in on the location
[08:03:49] <MootPoot> or you could go "boop" and know instantly where you are
[08:03:51] <JesseDesu> to those who dont know

[19:24:50] <saganman> are bagels still a thing in America TsundereNoises?
[19:25:06] <TsundereNoises> saganman: yes, but alas there are no good bagels near my new apartment
[19:25:08] <Sadale> I thought that bagel has been a common food there since forever.
[19:25:16] <TsundereNoises> saganman: that's more a failing of this town than of America in general though

[19:39:20] <Cryowolf> davic, screw on the tube/pipe? as far as you can and try to keep it as short as possible for optimal airflow (the shorter it is and the straighter it is, the less hot air gets trapped and the better it cools)

[19:40:12] <saganman> nice amigojapan, you finally got the vaccine. It's alright, they will subside soon.
[19:40:39] <amigojapan> saganman: did you finish getting the vaccine?
[19:40:43] <TsundereNoises> MootPoot: that just means Costco has a philosopher's stone somewhere

[19:42:24] <amigojapan> Ouch saganman . It's fun. I hope you can get it soon. Also it seems people that already had covid don't get strong sure effects

[20:14:19] <TsundereNoises> weirdly popular bad advice

[20:15:05] <Sadale> ButterNoodle, found
[20:15:09] <ButterNoodle> TsundereNoises: yes

[20:16:17] <ButterNoodle> yep thats the right one
[20:17:27] <saganman> then it all comes down to practice, writing the kanji couple of hundred times

[20:18:05] <ImoutoBot> saganman: I like the valley
[20:18:07] <TsundereNoises> lol
[20:18:16] <TsundereNoises> that's‚Ä¶ a bit off
[20:18:36] <TsundereNoises> saganman: better to learn kanji in the context of vocab
[20:18:44] <ButterNoodle> yep
[20:18:56] <TsundereNoises> otherwise you waste months "learning" a bunch of kanji and not knowing any japanese at all
[20:19:06] <TsundereNoises> and then not actually knowing how to read the kanji
[20:19:15] <ButterNoodle> I can understand a lot of whats going on in a manga just by the meanings of the kanji, when I cant pronounce what is written
[20:19:34] <TsundereNoises> heisig is like "I can recognize that this kanji isn't a bunch of lines" and that's really it, and you can get past that point just via exposure instead of wasting 6-12 months on it
[20:19:45] <TsundereNoises> the "keywords" are like half bullshit
[20:19:58] <TsundereNoises> anyway, Ë∞∑Èñì means cleavage

[20:20:09] <TsundereNoises> google image search helps with things like that
[20:21:01] <TsundereNoises> ButterNoodle: and you got to that point without wasting 6 months on running through 2000 flashcards
[20:21:12] <TsundereNoises> and now you still need to actually learn words
[20:21:38] <ButterNoodle> :|
[20:22:00] <TsundereNoises> anyway, I was trying to say to ButterNoodle "but don't you like cleavage?"
[20:22:13] <ButterNoodle> I know a lot.. on/kun-yomi fucks me tho
[20:22:19] <TsundereNoises> I suspect a man of culture like ButterNoodle can appreciate many different sizes
[20:22:35] <TsundereNoises> ButterNoodle: yeah but no need to really remember which is which, that's just trivia
[20:22:40] <TsundereNoises> just learn the words
[20:23:26] <S_T_A_N> ButterNoodle, I never got your reply :(
[20:23:28] <TsundereNoises> I guess you could remember it as kunyomi are the fucking stupid weird ones

[20:23:42] <ButterNoodle> never seen ur question S_T_A_N
[20:23:44] <saganman> TsundereNoises: Yeah, I do the same too. I take a peak at Heisig in what weird story they are putting for kanji which kind of gets stuck in my brain because of their silly stories.
[20:23:44] <ButterNoodle> man sex?
[20:24:06] <TsundereNoises> ButterNoodle: I'm glad you've been remembering the important vocab I share
[20:24:11] <ButterNoodle> :)
[20:24:25] <Matt|home> if you're referring to a male roughly as the same age as you who's probably equal in social standing either in class or work, is it normal to add the san suffix to their last name? like what's convention, because in a lot of anime i see male characters calling each other kun or chan and it's not done as a joke?
[20:24:46] <Matt|home> or does it really depend on way more context than that

[20:25:12] <TsundereNoises> mathu: it's all context and what your relationship with the person is, san is kind of distant/polite
[20:25:56] <Matt|home> so it's safe to call another guy with san if you don't really know them
[20:25:57] <TsundereNoises> Matt|home: but then you have like married couples who call each other san just out of habit or whatever, at least in media
[20:26:21] <TsundereNoises> Matt|home: yeah I think that's the safe option, which is why textbooks teach it as the main thing
