[09:28:33] <getivan> Hey, is anyone awake? I'm trying to find a string of regex, which will be compatible for Scrapebox, for the purposes of finding address strings. Scrapebox uses PCRE (Pearl Compatible Regular Expressions). Support recommended strings from https://www.regexlib.com/, but when I test them on regex101.com, nothing seems to match any HTML source code I
[09:28:34] <getivan> insert. I'm looking to match with address strings, like: Dallas, TX 7777 or Dallas TX 7777 or Dallas, Texas 7777 or 777 Main Street, Dallas, TX 7777 or 7777 Main St., Dallas, Texas 7777. Lots of variations, really, in how a site owner might put their street address on their page. The most promising regex from regexlib has been entered, here:
[09:28:34] <getivan> https://regex101.com/r/DtZD8d/1  --- Scrapebox support also said that I need to remove ^ and $ from the beginning and end of each string, so I tried that, but it didn't work either. I also tried running a test directly in Scrapebox, just now, but it just froze, so that particular string doesn't appear to work. Thanks!

[22:15:34] <digitok> seems to work
[22:15:44] <digitok> document.getElementById('results-table').innerHTML = document.getElementById('results-table').innerHTML.replace(/>[^<>\n]*</g,(m) => { return m.replace(/daniel/i,'<mark>$&</mark>'); });
[22:16:18] <digitok> you're testing in an es5 browser.
[22:16:21] <digitok> ?*
[22:16:50] <nomadme> good question lol
[22:18:24] <digitok> i ask because that () => {} syntax might be es6 also, i'm not a js expert
[22:18:57] <digitok> we might need to make it use the regular function syntax
[22:19:03] <nomadme> yeah, I'm converting the arrow func to old. I'm actually going to put in my es5 code and test it here shortly.
[22:21:43] <digitok> document.getElementById('results-table').innerHTML = document.getElementById('results-table').innerHTML.replace(/>[^<>\n]*</g,function (m) { return m.replace(/daniel/i,'<mark>$&</mark>'); });
[22:21:48] <digitok> seemed to work here
[22:22:36] <nomadme> for some reason I can't make it work on my browser,
[22:23:03] <nomadme> but if I switch daniel with a it works
[22:23:26] <nomadme> looks like it is able to get in to the cells on some of the cols.
[22:23:44] <nomadme> but it doesn't reach the a in daniel.
[22:23:51] <nomadme> does it make sense?
[22:26:27] <nomadme> I can't seem to troubleshoot, why it is not reaching the some other cells in the some other columns.
[22:27:37] <digitok> maybe console.log(m)
[22:28:35] <digitok> maybe you don't want to exclude newlines like you said?
[22:29:07] <digitok> remove \n and see if it helps
[22:30:04] <nomadme> X)  slap on face.
[22:30:10] <nomadme> that was it. lol
[22:30:17] <digitok> hehe
[22:30:59] <nomadme> I owe you a beer/coffee!
[22:32:11] <digitok> :p
[22:36:29] <nomadme> pm me where I can send you a gift card code.
