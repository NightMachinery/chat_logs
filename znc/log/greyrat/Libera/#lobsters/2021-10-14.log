[00:01:25] <feoh> A LOT of companies use node
[00:01:26] <af> paypal?
[00:01:48] <dimadima> dsc_: not sure about "companies" but i if you look at "who's hiring" every month there's a ton of node
[00:01:51] <af> roughly all of the silicon valley startups?
[00:01:52] <dimadima> those are startups though
[00:01:58] <feoh> beyond startup
[00:02:04] <dsc_> right
[00:02:06] <dimadima> prboably
[00:02:07] <af> I think paypal is the biggest one then

[00:02:23] <feoh> Amazon, MSFT, GOOG, IBM, it's EVERYWHERE
[00:02:25] <technomancy> I think we have stuff that uses node at build time
[00:02:28] <technomancy> at my job
[00:02:36] <dimadima> walmart.com in production right now is node.js
[00:02:40] <feoh> Bear in mind that what you see getting press is just the tip of any given iceberg
[00:02:46] <technomancy> mastodon uses it at build time to IIRC
[00:02:47] <af> oh I thought they meant only for the backend APIs
[00:03:03] <dsc_> yeah I did mean backend APIs

[00:05:29] <af> I'm thinking more like 2.5-3 years
[00:05:34] <dimadima> why would anyone run wasm in the backend when can use actual runtimes
[00:05:43] <dimadima> except for maybe "universal" rendering
[00:05:49] <technomancy> dimadima: because it has web in the name so it's clearly web scale
[00:05:53] <technomancy> like web sockets
[00:05:57] <af> dimadima: "why'd anyone run docker on the backend when can use actual operating systems"

[00:06:32] <dimadima> af: oh well that's totally different :)
[00:06:54] <af> dimadima: it's more similar deep down IMO
[00:07:02] <af> wasm promises portability
[00:07:04] <dimadima> af: you know, to, like segregate/isolate processes
[00:07:07] <af> much like docker did
[00:07:09] <dimadima> af: i see, i didn't know that
[00:07:11] <technomancy> af: write once ... run anywhere?
[00:07:18] <dimadima> i don't know much about wasm
[00:07:19] <technomancy> how revolutionary
[00:07:22] <af> technomancy: exactly
[00:07:26] <indigo> dimadima: More. Abstraction. Layers.
[00:07:36] <af> technomancy: think of how many technologies so far have tried to capitalize on that promise
[00:07:52] <shapr> but only C has succeeded!
[00:07:56] <af> java, javascript, docker, webassembly are the obvious ones
[00:08:08] <af> shapr: lol
[00:08:11] <technomancy> shapr: characterizing C as a success is ... certainly an interesting framing =)
[00:08:12] <indigo> af: I'm very pessimistic in my estimates
[00:08:16] * shapr laughs
[00:08:17] <technomancy> successful like cockroaches
[00:08:24] <shapr> I mean, well yeah
[00:08:28] <indigo> Has too many things derail in my career
[00:08:40] <feoh> If you gauge success as number of code lines running in the wild it's hard to argue with C being successful :)
[00:08:53] <technomancy> feoh: clearly that's a bad measure of success =)
[00:09:04] <technomancy> how about "actual problems solved vs problems created"
[00:09:08] <af> feoh: aren't you a fish shell maintainer, or I misremembering nicks again
[00:09:21] <shapr> Mind you, C gets write once run anywhere by means of autotools, so maybe it's just a bad idea all around.
[00:10:33] <af> oh never mind they are faho
[00:10:51] <dimadima> never understood "write once run anywhere"... someone's got to implement a VM for that to happem
[00:11:02] <dimadima> or, a compiler
[00:11:07] <shapr> or a browser
[00:11:19] <af> shapr: and also linux being able to load a myriad of executable types
[00:11:36] <shapr> yeah
[00:11:55] <af> but what I think the real test would be, which I hope comes sooner than expected, is the rise of ARM servers
[00:12:04] <shapr> uh, how many exactly? now I want to know
[00:12:15] <af> I think there is a wiki page on that
[00:12:31] <shapr> I just got lost in wikipedia's ELF page
[00:12:32] <companion_cube> shapr: I'd say java is a lot more "run anywhere" than C
[00:12:41] <companion_cube> (where "anywhere" is not micro controllers ofc)
[00:12:49] <kline> dimadima, do you get the value of having pluggable compilers?
[00:12:56] <companion_cube> C has you write platform specific code for each value of "anywhere"…
[00:13:01] <kline> its like "why have llvm when someone always needs to write a backend for new arches"
[00:13:08] <af> companion_cube: exactly my point
[00:13:18] <af> companion_cube: although I wholly disagree with java being better on that
[00:13:23] <af> case in point: android
[00:13:25] <dimadima> kline: sure
[00:13:28] <companion_cube> android isn't java ;)
[00:13:33] <varjag> java is written in c so doesn't count
[00:13:36] <kline> dimadima, its the same thing
[00:13:37] <companion_cube> says oracle vs google, as far as I understand
[00:13:40] <af> companion_cube: that's what they tell people
[00:13:44] <dimadima> pluggable anything makes sense. it's just, a lot of work either way it seems
[00:13:48] <companion_cube> varjag: C is written in assembly!!1!!1!
[00:13:51] <dimadima> just depends on what kind of work
[00:13:55] <af> but android is as java as android is C
[00:14:22] <af> C is written in various different assemblies
[00:14:23] <shapr> even reading about the ELF file header is overwhelming
[00:14:25] <shapr> I had no idea
[00:14:25] <varjag> companion_cube: most c compilers are not written in assembly
[00:14:26] <af> java is written in only one C
[00:14:39] <kline> dimadima, instead of having NxM compilers and needing to have M arch implementations for each language in N, you can have just 1 vm and then every program which runs on that VM lands on the new target
[00:14:48] <companion_cube> varjag: true
[00:14:56] <companion_cube> anyway, it's a confusing discussion
[00:14:58] <kline> rather than having to rewrite every program every time to get support
[00:15:03] <companion_cube> ^
[00:15:26] <af> kline: "modern" x86 CPUs have been VMs for some time now lol
[00:15:38] <af> hardware VMs
[00:15:43] <kline> yes, microcode etc
[00:15:44] <companion_cube> wasm/wasi is like "compile once to wasm, run anywhere"
[00:15:48] <af> I wonder how ARM is in that regard
[00:15:49] <kline> so?
[00:15:58] <shapr> There's some chance we'll have efficient graph reduction hardware in a few years, could change some things.
[00:15:59] <kline> all it really means is that risc still won in the end
[00:15:59] <af> kline: so not much, just fascinating I think
[00:16:00] <companion_cube> a lot more than C which is "compile for each platform, possibly with #ifdef"
[00:16:28] <shapr> just gotta write the #ifdefs once!
[00:16:28] <af> companion_cube: wasm's imports are complicated (but that's not wasms fault)
[00:16:47] <shapr> ok, I'm being snarky that the subject is underspecified
[00:17:50] <kline> the core of this discussion is that computers still suck
[00:17:52] <kline> programming sucks
[00:17:59] <af> I think for Java, what "write once" probably means is that you'd never want to write Java more than once
[00:18:03] <kline> im glad i only do it as and when i want these days (so not much)
[00:19:21] <varjag> write once, do shifts at abstract factory for the rest of your life

[00:19:31] <shapr> yeah, computers suck, that's why we make the small bucks
[00:19:42] <dimadima> java is less about "writing" and more about "authoring" since you're mostly using keyboard shortcuts to generate code and autocomplete stuff
[00:19:50] <shapr> that part makes me sad

A carrier frequency is modulated by the baseband video signal (and analog soundtracks). In a simplified view, positive parts of this variable frequency signal can produce lands and negative parts can be pits, which results in a projection of the FM signal along the track on the disc.

[09:05:32] <mockturtle> [ A good old-​fashioned Perl log analyzer ] - lobste.rs
[09:06:26] <imode> I don't think that's spam. meh.
[09:06:53] <imode> ignore the haters.
[09:11:33] <mjgardner> I’m trying to find an earlier post that was tagged spam but I think it’s beyond the search horizon.
[09:11:45] <imode> I wouldn't worry about it.
[09:11:50] <mjgardner> Thanks.
[09:12:58] <mjgardner> I’m only asking because I was recently banned from a subreddit and I think it was for violating the “9:1 rule.” So I’d like to not run afoul of such things elsewhere.
[09:14:18] <gerikson> mjgardner: the site is so low traffic that people tend to notice that some usernames almost exclusively post from some domains
[09:14:19] <mjgardner> (9:1 = post 9 things that aren’t yours for every one that is. It’s difficult when I write once a week, every week.)
[09:14:53] <gerikson> and if they own the domains that is a strong indication that they're trying to promote it, without engaging in the community otherwise
[09:16:10] <Irenes> spam is always subjective, my advice is usually to post a comment explaining why you thought it would be relevant to lobste.rs and engage with discussion

[09:17:09] <gerikson> also, someone flagging a submission as spam is only a signal, the mods have the ultimate authority to actually deem it spam
[09:17:29] <mjgardner> I do try to do that. I’ve even written articles inspired by lobste.rs discussions.
[09:17:46] <gerikson> iirc you post stuff about perl? some people don't like perl
[09:17:54] <mjgardner> Yah
[09:17:56] <gerikson> I mean, irrationally don't liek it
[09:18:06] <mjgardner> Funny there’s a tag for it then.
[09:18:25] <gerikson> maybe I'm just projecting
[09:18:29] <gerikson> ;)
[09:19:00] <Irenes> Perl is certainly an allowed topic
[09:19:38] <mjgardner> IIRC you can filter out tags, so Perl-haters need never let it darken their feeds.
[09:19:49] <gerikson> doug: pretty sure Damian Conway has forgotten more about computer science than you'll ever know ;)
[09:21:14] <mjgardner> OK, thanks for the input. Trying to remain a good citizen here.
[09:22:11] <gerikson> don't mind the haters
[09:22:26] <gerikson> I enjoy your submissions personally and upvote them
[09:22:58] <gerikson> also Irenes will correct me but I do believe you'll get a PM if you're starting to cross a line

[17:58:56] <companion_cube> :D wat
[17:59:05] <wink> gerikson: isn't pledge what you do at kickstarter? :) it means "yeet money into the sun, and in 10% you get something in return"
[17:59:07] <companion_cube> I pledge to keep my floors clean?

[18:00:05] <ngoldbaum> >Blem
[18:00:11] <pja> Blem. Wonderful
[18:00:27] <iDrougge> Capitaine Blem

[18:01:18] <indigo> Not to be confused with Flemish
[18:01:40] <indigo> Which is the competitor in Belgium

[18:04:54] <ngoldbaum> >Fairy was released onto the Australian market in 2011 and is quickly growing to become one of the most popular choices available within the country.[citation needed]
[18:05:00] <ngoldbaum> did fairy write this?
[18:05:12] <ngoldbaum> wikipedia is so astroturfed
[18:05:17] <wink> indigo: geriksonthat one is new to me, but I think the Pajero one was true?
[18:06:24] <gerikson> pretty sure the nissan(?) Fitta was never released in Sweden ;)
[18:06:32] <iDrougge> Honda
[18:06:39] <gerikson> oh yeha
[18:07:03] <ychaouche> hey guys
[18:07:18] <ychaouche>  anyone of you using kdevelop as their IDE ?  I just saw an 8 year old video featuring their python language support, and I have to say it's decent to say the least.
[18:07:33] <wink> gerikson: is that something a swede would shout if something went wrong?
[18:07:34] <ychaouche> it's not a very popular IDE, it seems only KDE people ever use it.
[18:08:06] <ngoldbaum> what does it have over vs code and pycharm?
[18:08:12] <gerikson> wink: it's the c-word
[18:08:44] <wink> gerikson: yeah I googled that, but I e.g. don't know any Engliush speaker who would use it on its own, without a sentence
[18:08:50] <kline> curwa
[18:08:59] <wink> gerikson: but it would explain what my ex-coworker shouted a lot.
[18:09:29] <wink> also I never found out what his exact wording of the sentence with helvete in it was :P
[18:09:32] <gerikson> they were rude... or felt they could use it freely outside .SE
[18:09:55] <gerikson> I learned that in UK English, "shit" is much more higly charged than in US English
[18:09:55] <wink> because that was always a whole sentence whereas fitta stood on its own.
[18:10:00] <gerikson> or Swedish forthat matter
[18:10:03] <wink> humans are peculiar :)
[18:10:16] <shapr> I used to swear in Swedish all the time, cause none of my coworkers spoke it or understood it.
[18:10:23] <ngoldbaum> wink: “go to hell” perhaps
[18:10:24] <gerikson> helvetes jävla fittjävel
[18:10:24] <shapr> But then they started repeating what I said, verbatim
[18:10:35] <shapr> and I said "you can't SAY that in public!"
[18:10:40] <gerikson> LOL
[18:11:14] <banna> shapr: are your co-workers parrots?
[18:11:19] <ngoldbaum> yes you only get to swear like that in public if there’s a swedish law to capture the corner case you pointed out
[18:11:23] <shapr> banna: only after three years or so
[18:11:31] <banna> ah, typical timeline yes
[18:11:51] <shapr> anyway, that taught me it's a bad idea to swear in a language no one around you understands
[18:12:25] <wink> eh, it depends
[18:12:29] <banna> not swearing is a sort of fine line between lameness and spophistication
[18:12:36] <banna> sophistication*
[18:12:53] <wink> gerikson: could you give me an audio recording with proper expression? then I can say if it was that ;)
[18:13:15] <shapr> I had fun digging into the etymology of those words when I was learning Swedish
[18:13:31] <shapr> jävla was djävla -> devil
[18:13:53] <shapr> helvete is hell
[18:13:54] *** Joins: koevet (~koevet@ip5b4113de.dynamic.kabel-deutschland.de)
[18:14:13] <wink> yeah I knew Finns who would only use "helvete" on it's own, like the f-word
[18:14:31] <shapr> so "helvetes jävla fittjävel" is literally: hell devil female genitalia devil
[18:14:36] <wink> but it's much more fun to learn about the whole sentences that don't translate 1:1
[18:15:12] <shapr> Finnish has a bunch more crazy swear words, some of my favorite are "ski into female genitalia"
[18:15:41] <banna> sounds like a friday night to me
[18:15:45] <wink> lol
[18:16:00] <shapr> My first two years in Europe were in Finland, and I spent those two years taking lessons and trying to learn the language.
[18:16:33] <wink> I spent 3 weeks in Italy in high school, I found the piece of paper with 20 swear words like 20y later :D
[18:16:36] <ngoldbaum> shapr: in swedish is it also literally a bunch of bad words strung together?
[18:16:53] <ychaouche> ngoldbaum: I think you need to pay for pycharm IIRC.
[18:16:58] <cb> shapr: suomi finlan perkeleeeeee
[18:17:08] <shapr> ngoldbaum: do you mean, what's the average swear word string in Swedish, or what exactly?
[18:17:17] <shapr> cb: saataana!
[18:17:31] <ngoldbaum> the hell devil c-word devil one
[18:18:07] <ngoldbaum> or does it have another understanding that makes more sense?
[18:18:24] <ngoldbaum> i guess there are plenty of english swears that are just a bunch of bad words strung together
[18:18:27] <shapr> yeah
[18:18:41] <ychaouche> ngoldbaum: I haven't looked at vscode yet so can't respond on that.
[18:18:47] <shapr> I do think you can get a view on what's important/sacred to a culture by checking the literal translation of their swear words
[18:19:05] <ngoldbaum> ychaouche: vscode and pycharm are by far the most popular python ide’s atm in my experience
[18:19:06] <shapr> for Americans it's relatives and bodily functions
[18:19:09] <ngoldbaum> so those are the competitors
[18:19:20] <shapr> "bodily function your mother" for example
[18:19:50] <shapr> Finnish and Swedish are more about religion, though the current cultures don't seem to match that
[18:20:08] <gerikson> shapr: yeah, I've heard that before
[18:20:25] <wink> I found it pretty funny when someone first told me that Americans find the f-word in professional contexts much much much more appalling than british people
[18:20:37] <shapr> the most offensive swear word I learned in Finnish was 'jumalauta' which as I understand is literally translated as something about Jesus
[18:20:53] <ngoldbaum> wink: and australians don’t blink at cunt
[18:20:58] <wink> yeah ofc
[18:21:09] <companion_cube> https://www.clockworkpi.com/ wtf is that
[18:21:10] <mockturtle> [ ClockworkPi | Open Source Hardware ] - www.clockworkpi.com
[18:21:12] <gerikson> the more potent words in Swedish refer to sex
[18:21:14] <shapr> and the most offensive swear word (as I was told) in Swedish was 'förbannad' which is literally translated as the imperative form of being excommunicated from the church
[18:21:30] <gerikson> shapr: who told you that?!
[18:21:33] <ngoldbaum> the reformation really did a number
[18:21:45] <shapr> gerikson: someone who is probably 70 years old these days
[18:21:55] <gerikson> it basically means you're really annoyed
[18:21:59] <shapr> whaat
[18:22:04] <shapr> I have been misinformed!
[18:22:08] <gerikson> you have!
[18:22:10] <shapr> oh man
[18:22:28] <shapr> this is the fun of learning other languages
[18:22:31] <gerikson> or if you were in the north, it was one of the weird religious people they have up there
[18:22:36] <shapr> oh, probably that
[18:22:48] <shapr> I lived in Tornio Finland and then Boden, Sweden during my time in Europe

[18:22:57] <shapr> oh man do I have stories about THAT
[18:23:11] <shapr> I was on a bus and this guy tried to marry his sister off to me
[18:23:23] <gerikson> kinda forwards
[18:23:28] <gerikson> *forward
[18:23:31] <shapr> yeah, it got weird and then weirder
[18:23:32] <Church> Well then
[18:23:37] <Church> Well go on then
[18:23:44] <Church> I'm on the edge of my actual seat here
[18:23:52] <gerikson> "Jag är förbannad" - I am really angry
[18:24:05] <gerikson> "Förbannat kallt" - really damn cold

[18:24:20] <mockturtle> [ Laestadianism - Wikipedia ] - en.wikipedia.org
[18:24:26] <gerikson> yeha förbannad and damn are about equiv
[18:24:49] <shapr> the way it was explained to me, company towns were created and the employees were effectively indentured servants and encouraged to be alcoholics
[18:25:07] <shapr> and this one guy got angry about that and setup a religion that was designed to prevent that
[18:25:17] <Church> Interesting, mainly focus on American Christian sects. So this is a new one.
[18:25:19] <gerikson> the vodka belt is a thing
[18:25:23] <wink> lol
[18:25:24] <shapr> but it lead to a bunch of weird things like Laestadians aren't allowed to own televisions
[18:25:38] <gerikson> ``"Worldliness" is discouraged, and Laestadians frown on pre-marital sex and on alcohol consumption except in the sacrament of holy communion''
[18:25:45] <shapr> (though it turns out they weren't punished for *renting* televisions)
[18:25:57] <wink> in Bavaria a lot of curse things are also religious, unsurprisingly with a high catholic population
[18:25:59] <gerikson> this sentence imlies it's ok to fuck during communion
[18:26:11] <shapr> haha
[18:26:27] <gerikson> I mean hey as ong as its consensual
[18:26:31] <kline> same with quebecois, right?
[18:26:38] <shapr> so anyway, the Laestadians where I lived usually married and had kids by the time they were 18 or 19 years old
[18:26:43] <kline> half their curses are based on church furniture
[18:26:48] <shapr> and this guy on the bus had a sister who was an "old maid" he told me

[20:05:26] <wrl> cities are great
[20:06:36] <ngoldbaum> cities are great
[20:06:49] <ngoldbaum> almost like it’s a personal pref thing
[20:07:16] <imode> the less people the better IMO.
[20:07:35] <technomancy> I do not miss driving, I tell ya what
[20:07:37] <imode> the pollution, day to day chaos.
[20:07:46] <technomancy> cities can be OK if they have good transit, but that rules out 90% of the ones in the US
[20:08:51] <imode> if cities were planned for bikes or public transit ONLY, as well as being capped at a particular population level, with proper waste management, I wouldn't have a problem with them.
[20:09:04] <ngoldbaum> time to move to leiden or something
[20:09:54] <imode> I do speak from a US perspective, other places probably have this handled better so my speech looks weird.
[20:13:39] <indigo> LA has some of the worst traffic ever
[20:13:46] <yeirr> cities are double edged swords
[20:13:51] <indigo> It actually prevents me from going out on weekdays most of the time

[20:18:34] <varjag> but i was there mid summer maybe it's seasonal
[20:18:36] <deadk> i don't think i can engage with the population cap idea without getting political
[20:18:39] <deadk> so i won't
[20:19:31] <deadk> cities in europe tend to be much less car-friendly and have much better transport than most american ones

[20:19:59] <imode> I'm hoping Seattle's new light rail exensions change my perception.
[20:20:11] <southclaws> it's more of a mix in Europe, really depends where you are
[20:20:22] <southclaws> some cities are very car friendly,  and less walkable
[20:20:25] <Brekkjern> Oslo is trying to ban cars in the city center

[20:20:36] <companion_cube> except for moving vans
[20:20:36] <deadk> there are a lot of cities in both continents that i have not been to
[20:20:49] <southclaws> London has the congestion charge,  so central is basically just necessary vehicles like delivery and taxis
[20:20:52] <imode> good for long distance travel and moving, not for general transit.
[20:20:54] <yeirr> bikes or ebikes
[20:21:46] <deadk> london has the congestion charge and the ULEZ and it's also just completely stupid to drive anywhere inside the circulars (which are not the same as the ring road, for the non-londoners)

[20:24:51] <indigo> Oh shit varjag! You just missed me, I live right next to MDR
[20:24:55] <southclaws> not sure what immigration is like,  but we met quite a few people from outside iceland who had settled there - including an American!
[20:25:21] <southclaws> it's certainly a peaceful place to live,  though if you crave constant hustle, you'd get bored quick
[20:25:33] <imode> I am the exact opposite of craving a constant hustle.
[20:25:54] <southclaws> then it's likely perfect,  especially if you like any outdoors or winter sports!
[20:25:58] <yeirr> do yall have your own greenhouse farm etc?
[20:26:27] <yeirr> last I saw, getting fresh groceries is a chore
[20:26:32] <southclaws> there's one barley farm in Iceland...
[20:26:43] <southclaws> other than that, basically everything is imported
[20:26:48] <southclaws> hence the insane prices
[20:27:02] <imode> sad... looks like I wouldn't be able to settle. remote work, nobody icelandic to marry, not an EEA or EFTA national, no need to study in Iceland, no family in Iceland...
[20:27:32] <technomancy> in thailand you can often get a visa to learn the language; I wonder how common that is elsewhere
[20:27:39] <southclaws> at least you're not a horse imode
[20:27:48] <southclaws> horses are outright banned from Iceland
[20:27:52] <imode> woah why.
[20:27:53] <technomancy> just be like "maaaan this language is real hard; gonna take a few more years before I get it down"
[20:28:10] <southclaws> because they have their own "Icelandic breed" which is very pure and virtually untouched genetically speaking
[20:28:17] <imode> oh lovely!
[20:28:20] <yeirr> i always enjoyed watching vacations in Iceland
[20:28:27] <southclaws> and importing any horse from other countries would introduce unseen disease and different genetics
[20:28:33] <Brekkjern> I bet that horse breed is about as inbred as the Icelandic population is XD
[20:28:34] <southclaws> so it's against the law

[20:31:28] <southclaws> good idea
[20:32:27] <Brekkjern> imode: It is possible to move to EU countries, but you would need to have a degree and a job offer that would sponsor the Visa. Once you're inside the EU I believe you are free to move to other countries in the EEA, but don't quote me on that.
[20:32:32] <indigo> I hear in TX there is a good chance folks will yell at you if you cycle
[20:32:37] <yeirr> or you can cycle stationary
[20:33:03] <southclaws> iceland is not EU too, it's EEZ/EEA/Schengen,  or something
[20:33:07] <southclaws> either one, or all three
[20:33:24] <Brekkjern> Yeah, the same rules should apply there too
[20:33:38] <imode> meh, who am I kidding.

[20:39:37] <goodger> this conversation seems highly computing-focused
[20:39:42] <southclaws> very social people, not sure what the drinking culture is like,  beer is super expensive
[20:39:50] <yeirr> define expensive?
[20:39:50] <imode> gerikson: meh, at least it's friendly.
[20:40:30] <Brekkjern> I didn't think this channel required computing focused chats, just not politics?
[20:40:47] <southclaws> yeirr: well,  I bought a round for 3 of us,  £25,  also these were not even *pints* of beer but like 250ml
[20:41:01] <imode> meh. "topic" is broadly defined as vaguely computing focused but this is cultural, I don't have a problem with it.
[20:41:08] <southclaws> and if there's nothing computery to talk about I see no harm in chatting about other stuff

[20:41:50] <southclaws> so,  like 30 euros
[20:41:50] <yeirr> its about USD$12 where im from
[20:41:50] <kline> 25 quid for 3 drinking glasses of beer...?
[20:41:55] <southclaws> yeah
[20:41:58] <yeirr> for a pack of 6

[20:42:11] <southclaws> insanity,
[20:42:14] <imode> that's horrifying.
[20:42:21] <Church> Seems normal to me
[20:42:36] <southclaws> and I live in London, which is famous for expensive beer (7, 8, 9 $10 for a pint etc)
[20:42:47] <yeirr> but is it worth it?
[20:42:49] <deadk> you'd pay that for three drinks in london easily but they'd be pints
[20:42:50] <kline> no
[20:42:56] <southclaws> it was very nice beer actually
[20:43:03] <imode> at least it was nice!
[20:43:07] <southclaws> but,  I would not be going out drinking an "English amount" every weekend
[20:43:10] <southclaws> I'd be bankrupt!
[20:43:11] <kline> come back to edinburgh
[20:43:22] <kline> £2 pints i remember in 2012
[20:43:28] <southclaws> damn yeah
[20:43:35] <goodger> but it doesn't have american freedoms
[20:43:36] <deadk> those were explicitly crap pints

[20:44:02] <deadk> they still play fitbaw yes
[20:44:06] <imode> anime in pubs lmfao.
[20:44:09] <southclaws> yeah basically every pub has a game playing in the background

[20:51:18] <goodger> I find all linux distributions I've tried recently to be highly unsatisfactory

[20:51:31] <goodger> what would you suggest is the next one to try?
[20:51:35] <wink> goodger: why? like, which criteria?
[20:51:39] <imode> goodger: depends, what have you tried?
[20:51:42] <Church> goodger: nixOS obviously
[20:51:57] <wink> Church: is that a distro or just a lego set
[20:52:01] <Brekkjern> goodger: Red Star OS
[20:52:07] <imode> ^ only real answer.
[20:52:13] <southclaws> WSL2
[20:52:13] <Church> Yes
[20:52:24] <deadk> try hybridized distros
[20:52:29] <imode> use arch. btw.
[20:52:37] <deadk> install debian, then install gentoo over the top of it
[20:52:47] <imode> and then run freebsd in a VM for good measure.
[20:52:49] <goodger> I want something that's almost exactly like arch, but with fewer catastrophically dumb bugs being introduced
[20:52:51] <nyarmith> I recently used void and thought it was pretty fast and neat
[20:53:00] <imode> goodger: what bugs?
[20:53:04] <wink> mount your arch iso as /scratch and then install linux from scratch
[20:53:09] <goodger> like, if arch had any kind of testing period, that would be ideal
[20:53:09] <deadk> ayy
[20:53:11] <southclaws> i never understood complaints of "bloat" in ubuntu until i checked one of my machine's groups list and found a default group named "games" lol
[20:53:32] <yeirr> nyarmith: does void play well with nvidia drivers?
[20:53:50] <wink> southclaws: my main gripe is that errors for technical users are ungoogleable. you'll find 10 questions, no answers besides "I reinstalled and it worked lol"
[20:53:51] <southclaws> so I'm kind of on the hunt for a super light weight, secure linux distro for servers
[20:54:14] <goodger> imode: the one that convinced me to try something else was the update to kde frameworks that caused konversation to segfault randomly
[20:54:16] <kline> 12/29/2021, 11:00:58 PM (British Summer Time)
[20:54:20] <yeirr> whats keeping me from distro hopping is compatibility with nvidia drivers
[20:54:21] <southclaws> wink thankfully I never have that issue, but that's because I basically just install Docker and then do everything in containers,  the host is never really touched
[20:54:22] <imode> goodger: oh tha's fuuuuun.
[20:54:24] <kline> why is firefox giving me localised times but not dates
[20:54:31] <deadk> southclaws: well, i just use debian and deal with debian's shit
[20:54:34] <gerikson> southclaws: so an extra line in /etc/groups is bloat?
[20:54:43] <deadk> no distro is perfect
[20:54:45] <goodger> kline: why does firefox report the time in UTC to whatsapp et al.? who can say?
[20:55:07] <imode> I use Debian and then forget about it.
[20:55:09] <southclaws> not the line of text itself,  but just what it represents,  like why does a server OS need a games group? is it there for a reason? is there some preinstalled nonsense I don't know about?
[20:55:21] <imode> southclaws: yeah that's why I stay far away from ubuntu.
[20:55:27] <kline> goodger, this is in the certificate viewer for firefox
[20:55:28] <imode> why does an OS need a games group in general.
[20:55:31] <southclaws> I just grab it as a default because it works
[20:55:42] <goodger> imode: I feel like if anyone had tested that update for longer than is required to check that it compiles and loads, it would have been caught
[20:55:44] <southclaws> why does a *linux* OS need a games group :P
[20:55:51] <deadk> debian has a games group too
[20:55:53] <imode> what does the games group even do?!
[20:55:57] <deadk> i assume there's some historical reason
[20:55:58] <kline> southclaws, >he doesnt play supertuxkart
[20:56:11] <imode> ay I play sauerbraten and zandronum, I get my fill. :P
[20:56:16] <southclaws> i'm not pro enough for that kline :(
[20:56:51] <southclaws> i was interested to use CoreOS, then it got canned,  Talos looks interesting
[20:57:10] <kline> im still quietly hoping that unikernels come back into vogue
[20:57:11] <goodger> so an arch with at least minimally competent quality control would be cool, or else a port of AUR to debian maybe :P
[20:57:20] <imode> there do exist arch derivatives.
[20:57:28] <wrl> southclaws: flatcar is a coreos derivative that's still actively developed
[20:57:46] <southclaws> ooooh thanks wrl that looks interesting!
[20:58:19] <southclaws> >A minimal OS image only includes the tools needed to run containers. No package manager, no configuration drift.
[20:58:19] <southclaws> that's basically exactly what I had in mind - smaller surface area, fewer things to worry about security/provision wise
[20:58:31] <imode> I'll say this, fuck wayland-as-the-default. my wife is running GNOME at the moment and Steam would just randomly hang every five seconds and games would crash. took us a month to figure that out. the default was enabled in an update.
[20:58:51] <imode> so I feel your pain even though it's a different issue.
[20:59:03] <goodger> you didn't notice the difference between wayland and Xorg when the change hit?
[20:59:04] * wink is using debian for personal stuff (excludin mail server because of LTS lifespan) and ubuntu for work laptops because they told me to
[20:59:11] <imode> goodger: not a damn thing.
[20:59:14] <technomancy> yeah my kids thinkpad crashed randomly playing games till I switched off wayland
[20:59:21] <wink> manjaro looked cool
[20:59:28] <goodger> huh, weird. wayland is pretty much unusable on my system
[20:59:38] <companion_cube> sorry, what change?
[20:59:39] <imode> well that's the thing, we were wondering why things were broken in subtle ways.
[20:59:42] <yeirr> imode: might be temps or memory issues tho
[20:59:55] <goodger> every window gets a different cursor size, for instance :D
[20:59:56] <imode> yeirr: we swapped back to Xorg and have _no problems_.
