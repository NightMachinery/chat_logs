[12:16:27] <sm> I have enabled `allowUnconnectedMatrixUsers` in the matrix room. Hopefully this fixes the occasional non-delivery of first IRC messages to matrix.

[12:18:02] <sm> it means a matrix user not connected to libera can still see messages from libera 
[12:18:40] <sm> so, don't be revealing your secret IRC plans to overthrow the matrix
[12:20:12] <f-a> I will reveal my secret LibreJam plans tho http://www.ariis.it/link/t/lj202202/
[12:20:41] <sm> w00t! another f-a joint on the way
[12:24:10] <f-a> hopefully!

[20:17:11] <f-a> I ended up learning some `ed`
[20:26:29] <ManofLetters[m]> ed is the standard Unix text editor.
[20:31:37] <f-a> it is not bad, you can see why blind people use it (and `edbrowse`)
[20:31:49] <f-a> very little output

[20:34:03] <ManofLetters[m]> I've never used it, but this file (and a few other manifestos in the same directory) included on Slackware floppies shaped me as a young man: https://www.gnu.org/fun/jokes/ed-msg.en.html
[20:36:32] * f-a smiles
[21:24:42] <EvanR> I wrote a large amount of lambdamoo code within which their text editor is similar to ed
[21:24:48] <EvanR> wasn't that bad
[21:25:02] <EvanR> at this point I think my use of vim is worse for the wrists
[21:29:22] <f-a> http://www.ariis.it/link/t/lj202202/ more log
[21:29:27] <f-a> they say emacs is even worse
[21:29:35] <f-a> I do not like pressing two keys at the same time
[21:29:52] <ManofLetters[m]> I use emacs with mouse
[21:29:57] <ManofLetters[m]> rarely press two keys
