[00:04:58] <shibboleth> lemme guess: depends heavily on javascript and is actually a way for them to improve their model?
[00:05:38] <JimBuntu> Oh, almost assured it helps them improve their models, would be kind of silly if they didn't watch what changes people preferred to make
[00:05:41] <shibboleth> like with scroogle recaptcha
[00:06:34] <JimBuntu> Since they also offer paid licenses... (which I bought some of, lol)... I'm sure the money helps them too

[00:23:21] <Joanna> I found https://github.com/nickboucher/trojan-source interesting but I’m not sure of exactly which lines of code to look at. And I’m also wondering if there are programming languages which prohibit this stuff

[00:41:27] <Joanna> JimBuntu: I think they will eventually get rid of people in media altogether and use fakes that don’t have to be paid anything.
[01:15:18] <viktech> no, people get emotionally attached to other people and it will always be more effective to use a person 
[01:15:32] <viktech> but less impactful media may simplifyinto what you said
