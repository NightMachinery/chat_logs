[04:59:32] <dimadima> i don't actually know but i think many people take him pretty seriously
[05:01:37] <wrl> they do
[05:08:43] <dimadima> it seems improbably that the world could go on like that, but it does
[05:08:47] <dimadima> improbable*
[05:10:43] <manicennui> We thought that the Internet would educate the masses, but instead it has just shown us how truly dumb people are.
[05:10:57] <manicennui> And provided the stupids with information about how to perfect their craft.
[05:13:01] <dimadima> i just think it's weird to, like, believe that trump won the election
[05:13:24] <manicennui> The key is to just stop thinking.
[05:13:25] <dimadima> and that we've got these fauci and bill gates ppl killing everyone with vaccines and withholding drugs for covid
[05:13:32] <dimadima> and, to, just... not do anything about it
[05:13:32] <manicennui> Start with what you want to be true.
[05:13:34] <dimadima> YET
[05:13:35] <manicennui> And go from there.
[05:13:40] <dimadima> they do seem to believe it
[05:14:25] <dimadima> it's just weird the most we've got is the capitol riot
[05:14:39] <dimadima> if ppl believe this stuff what are they doing taking it
[05:15:13] <manicennui> They also fucked with a few state capitals, made plans to kidnap governors, etc.
[05:15:59] <dimadima> but for fucks sake they stole the election!
[05:16:08] <dimadima> and they call themselves patriots??
[05:16:11] <dimadima> it's kind of ridiculous
[05:16:13] <dimadima> some patriots
[05:16:18] <ngoldbaum> they don’t really believe it
[05:16:24] <dimadima> i guess not?
[05:16:30] <dimadima> but they do?
[05:16:37] <manicennui> I think the number of true believers is too low to really do anything.
[05:16:40] <ngoldbaum> the same way they didn’t really believe the cia assassinated jfk or whatever
[05:16:44] <manicennui> But you have had the idiots blowing shit up or planning to.
[05:17:02] <dimadima> i'll tell you my in-laws definitely believe the election was stolen
[05:17:13] <dimadima> i mean maybe in their hearts they do not
[05:17:25] <manicennui> Why not ask them why they aren't doing more?
[05:17:29] <dimadima> but they sure spend a lot of mental energy such that you'd think they really bleieve
[05:17:47] <dimadima> i don't want to go there with my inlaws lol
[05:17:51] <dimadima> but that's a good question
[05:18:32] <manicennui> It's possible that most of them don't really believe it, but keep repeating it as an excuse for their general shitty behavior.
[05:18:40] <ngoldbaum> they enjoy the soap opera on fox news that tells them they’re the big victim in all this
[05:19:03] <dimadima> i guess
[05:19:05] <ngoldbaum> very reassuring, don’t need to confront the racism
[05:19:20] <dimadima> i'd feel ridiculous kinda sorta believing some shit like that while acting all serious about it
[05:19:34] <dimadima> pretty intense to say they stole the election
[05:19:44] <dimadima> that's a serious fucking problem lol
[05:19:47] <manicennui> dimadima: Yeah, but I'd also feel ridiculous supporting someone like Trump.
[05:19:57] <dimadima> yes me too

[05:22:38] <manicennui> The squat is much like its name — the back of a pickup truck is lowered or kept the same and the height of the front of the truck is raised. That makes a truck appear as if it is “squatting.”

[05:26:16] <manicennui> I did see assholes with super wide pickups with super wide mirrors driving on Blue Ride Parkway. Their trucks were so large they were hanging into the oncoming lane.
[05:26:28] <manicennui> Blue Ridge Parkway is quite narrow in most parts, and one lane in each direction.

It’s up to viewers to decide the fate of these three poor souls trying to survive the wrath of The Undertaker."

[17:50:55] <gerikson> the debate right now is that restrictions are being lifted *too* soon
[17:51:03] <gwozniak> I suspect he's on board with the People's Party of Canada, which is the true right-wing nutshow here
[17:51:27] <gwozniak> Because "muh freedoms"
[17:51:30] <gerikson> it was ever thus, the infamous "22 scientists" campaigned on much much stricter lockdowns at the outset in Sweden

[17:52:35] <gerikson> this just proves to me we have no fucking chance of addressing climate change
[17:52:44] <gwozniak> I don't think most people even really believe that stuff, but it gives them an excuse to act like assholes
[17:52:49] <prussian> in all honesty. Corona is bad for a wide variety of reasons, but ultimately it isn't some world ending hell scape.
[17:52:56] <gerikson> this is - a deadly disease which can be avoided by getting a vaccine
[17:53:00] <gerikson> and people are denying reality
[17:53:08] <gerikson> and the vaccine is free
[17:53:13] <prussian> so that's 99% of the problem. if this was like Polio, idk if people would be so "strong-willed"
[17:53:31] <gerikson> no, if it hit kids hardest, we'd see another tune
[17:53:51] <gwozniak> I'm beginning to think we value individual freedom too highly. Not sure how to express that, really, but I keep coming back to it
[17:53:58] <prussian> gerikson: true...
[17:54:16] <gerikson> today in Techrights crazy: California caused the Berlin Wall to fall, thereby ending the utopia of East Germany
[17:54:28] <gerikson> gwozniak: oh, deffo
[17:54:32] <prussian> rip...
[17:54:53] <riv> gwozniak, the problem isn't individual freedom so much as individuals being bat shit insane
[17:55:49] <prussian> freedom isn't free.
[17:55:56] <gwozniak> riv: I think that is mostly driven by a complete lack of trust in institutions and a belief that the individual, pulling themselves up by their own bootstraps, can accomplish great things. It's what we've been told for a long time
[17:56:07] <riv> yeah
[17:57:01] <gwozniak> gotta get ready for 2.5 hours of knowledge transfer meetings. Sucks when a senior person leaves
[17:57:02] <riv> it's tricky because instutitions can be extremely harmful to people, but so can the sum of individual actions when masses of people agree on some terrible ideas (mostly due to the way the internet makes stupid ideas popular)
[17:57:19] <riv> so it's not really like we can side with either

[18:25:51] <prussian> literally, since I literally just snuck in.
[18:26:01] <gerikson> I approve
[18:26:32] <ngoldbaum> i left early because it was less of a talk and more of a rant
[18:26:38] <dimadima> when i saw him he gave a preamble (lecture?) about how you can't take pics of him and post them on FB/mainstream social media
[18:26:44] <ngoldbaum> don’t know what i expected tbh
[18:26:44] <prussian> I met him once when he was protesting nonfree software during HackMIT and another time where I left with my friends and we chanted to get him on a full bus
[18:26:50] <prussian> literally "let stallman on the bus"
[18:26:56] <prussian> was funny
[18:27:04] <prussian> ngoldbaum: nice.
[18:27:05] <dimadima> lol
[18:27:05] <prussian> lmao
[18:27:24] <prussian> and ya, he was all about "don't post these selfies on facebook"
[18:27:31] <prussian> real fucking hero...
[18:27:32] <ngoldbaum> is that what “bus factor” means?
[18:27:35] <prussian> yes
[18:27:39] <dimadima> i actually try to use less GNU stuff after my experience w/ stallman
[18:27:56] <dimadima> he trolled me in like 0.5 seconds
[18:27:57] <prussian> his talks are extremely predictable and unactionable if you know his nuttiness
[18:28:00] <dimadima> tirlled/triggered
[18:28:11] <ngoldbaum> free software would be in a better place today if rms had died in a bus crash in, let’s say, 2003
[18:28:22] <dimadima> yeah seriously
[18:28:23] <prussian> one of my friends literally asked him what his "favorite linux distro" was to trigger him.
[18:28:27] <prussian> it worked by the way...
[18:28:30] <dimadima> lol
[18:28:38] <dimadima> i actually don't know what RMS would say about that
[18:28:40] <prussian> ngoldbaum: hard to say
[18:28:54] <dimadima> what does RMS use?
[18:28:55] <prussian> well he went about GNU/Linux and shit
[18:28:58] <ngoldbaum> prussian: gplv3 killed free software on long timescales
[18:28:58] <prussian> idk
[18:29:11] <dimadima> i can't imagine RMS uses anything
[18:29:21] <prussian> linux distro is in fact GANU PLUS LEENUCKS
[18:29:24] <dimadima> at this point he must program on pen/paper or some mid 90s harwdare or something
[18:29:38] <dimadima> when not ranting
[18:29:38] <ngoldbaum> without gplv3 clang not exist and bsd-licensed ecosystems would be much less of a thing
[18:30:03] <prussian> which is why I set my CTCP VERSION response to that.
[18:30:23] <prussian> ngoldbaum: probably.
[18:30:24] <prussian> but idk
[18:30:27] <prussian> ffs
[18:30:31] <prussian> meeting at 10am?
[18:30:32] <prussian> bbl
[18:30:42] <prussian> short story, stallman is whack.

[19:35:12] <wrl> of course they do
[19:35:12] <riv> "no"
[19:35:14] <wrl> of course they are

[19:37:31] <wrl> ranting about... prions?? in the vaccines?????
[19:38:18] <riv> dont tell me about this stuff i scare easily
[19:39:13] <manicennui> riv: Wait until you find out about all of the scary sounding chemicals in all of the medications you take, even over the counter stuff!
[19:40:24] <manicennui> Why aren't these idiots concerned about everything else?
[19:40:27] <manicennui> Tylenol:
[19:40:29] <manicennui> Active ingredient (in each gelcap)(Purpose) Acetaminophen (500 mg) (Pain reliever/fever reducer) Inactive ingredients benzyl alcohol, butylparaben, carboxymethylcellulose sodium, D&C yellow no. 10, edetate calcium disodium, FD&C blue no. 1, FD&C red no. 40, gelatin, hypromellose, iron oxide, magnesium stearate, methylparaben, modified starch, polyethylene glycol, polysorbate 80, powdered cellulose, pregelatinized starch,

[19:41:27] <riv> bruh
[19:41:33] <manicennui> The metals are obviously part of the trackers!
[19:42:31] <wrl> riv: there are no prions in the vaccines
[19:42:53] <manicennui> riv: Don't let wrl hide the truth from you.
[19:43:55] <riv> the idea that prions might occur from your cells transcribing alien mRNA has literally never occured to me
[19:44:00] <riv> and now it can't be unthought
[19:44:31] <riv> but this thought ends with me - i'm not going to tell anyone outside of here about it
[19:45:40] <prussian> I mean, any transcription can result in misfolded proteins.
[19:46:07] <prussian> like, I don't see how transcripting some mRNA fragment is any more dangerous than what the rona virus does already.
[19:48:41] <wrl> ^ yeah, massive facts
[19:49:05] <manicennui> Yeah, but we know that Bill Gates writes buggy software.
[19:49:21] <prussian> folding sucks
[19:49:31] <prussian> idk, maybe there is something to it, but I'm not really sold.
[19:49:50] <prussian> i'd really want a good model to demonstrate the supposed risk (vs regular infection and replication)
[19:51:25] <wrl> yeah, keeping in mind that viral infection, y'know, also mRNA transcription
[19:51:31] <wrl> but with... a whole lot more collateral damage
[19:51:43] <kline> wrl | ranting about... prions?? in the vaccines?????
[19:51:48] <kline> turning the damn brain cells gay
[19:51:48] <wrl> kline: alex jones
[19:51:49] <riv> prussian, it's not more dangerous
[19:51:59] <riv> but fear isn't always rational
[19:52:05] <prussian> wrl: ya.
[19:52:20] <wrl> riv: i'll be honest, i was a little irrationally afraid of getting the vax as well. just a little bit.
[19:52:24] <wrl> but i still got it asap
[19:52:42] <riv> i dont think the fear is irrational, it's a new vaccine. I was scared too
[19:53:17] <prussian> I mean, it not only makes proteins, but integrates and hijacks host cell's nucleus for its evil plan. so it's probably like at least 100000x worse than a simple RNA fragment that will be exhausted and metabolized.
[19:54:04] <prussian> only thing that scares me about the vaxx is still the nanolipids they use to enter targeted cells
[19:55:21] <riv> i don't know about nanolipids
[19:55:25] <prussian> creepy stuff. my understanding is it comes from some specific early life experimentations and observations in thermal vent pools
[19:55:51] <prussian> well from what I heard, the vaccine being uptaken in say your liver or heart would be pretty bad.
[19:55:52] <companion_cube> prussian: what kind of model do you need
[19:55:55] <prussian> idk
[19:56:05] <companion_cube> It's obvious the vaccine is less dangerous than covid
[19:56:11] <prussian> a good pic + explainer would be good enough imo
[19:56:13] <riv> I guess this is a joke that went over my head :P
[19:56:19] <prussian> ?

[21:23:34] <gerikson> that's a great mnemonic
[21:24:23] <Brekkjern> I do it too :P
[21:24:40] <Brekkjern> It was how I was taught back in primary school
[21:25:13] <gerikson> how Norwegian ;)
[21:25:36] <Brekkjern> Hahaha
[21:25:48] <Brekkjern> I feel like I've started something now...
[21:26:35] <manicennui> The solution is to use gt and lt instead, obviously.
[21:26:42] <Brekkjern> Yeah
[21:29:44] <gwozniak> I learned that same thing back in primary school too
[21:30:05] <manicennui> I think I've heard it before, but I have never had a problem with that operator in particular.
[21:31:30] <Brekkjern> Don't have a problem really, but it's pretty solidly implanted in my mind, so I usually don't get time to think about it before my brain goes "Crocodile!"
[21:32:14] <manicennui> I think "greater than" and "less than".
[21:32:56] <gwozniak> I know it's "gt" or "lt", but I still think about the crocodile
[21:33:02] <gwozniak> More fun

[21:38:36] <manicennui> Um.

[22:20:44] <manicennui> Not that this test proves anything.

[23:42:51] <prussian> I eat orange peels too. If they aren't like paper thin, they usually have a mild sweetness to them.
[23:42:54] <prussian> hard to explain
[23:43:13] * manicennui thinks prussian might actually be some other kind of primate.
[23:43:35] <prussian> I also like 100% chocolate (no sugar mass)
[23:43:44] <riv> i like that too
[23:43:45] <prussian> so I eat strange things I guess.
[23:44:11] <manicennui> prussian: That I like.
[23:44:25] <manicennui> But I'll usually eat something closer to 85%.
[23:44:31] <prussian> but ya I like lemon peels.
[23:45:35] <manicennui> I like lemon zest in things, I love lemon juice, and I love preserved lemon.
[23:45:42] <manicennui> But I don't know that I'd eat entire lemons.
[23:45:47] <manicennui> Other than preserved.
[23:46:10] <indigo> Isn't that super bad for your teeth
[23:46:22] <prussian> I make little wedges and will bite the pulpy body and eat the peel.
[23:46:31] <manicennui> I eat tons of candy. Fuck my teeth.
[23:46:34] <prussian> indigo: i don't know. I don't have serious teeth issues.
[23:46:50] <indigo> I like eating grapefruit by peeling it
[23:46:51] <prussian> i have like a few cavities. no root canals or other major dental issues.
[23:46:56] <manicennui> I have to not keep sour patch kids around because I will eat them until my teeth hurt.
[23:47:01] <prussian> yum
[23:47:16] <prussian> ya malic acid gummies are good
[23:48:57] <indigo> I looove Starburst
[23:49:17] <indigo> And oatmeal chocolate chip cookies
[23:49:24] <riv> yum
[23:49:26] <prussian> truly
[23:50:21] <riv> i should do some baking soon
[23:51:10] <manicennui> indigo: Yeah, Starburst are great. I found a smaller candy company that makes similar candy that is great too.

[23:55:48] <manicennui> I was joking around with a coworker about starting a candy company. We are both addicted.
[23:55:56] <manicennui> We agreed that we probably wouldn't live very long.
[23:56:19] <manicennui> Only way I can get myself not to eat a ton of candy is to not have it around.
[23:57:54] <manicennui> The other thing I love is caramel Milka bars.
[23:59:41] * manicennui prepares to attend a meeting where business will be sold another magical solution so they can act surprised later when it doesn't actually save us time.
