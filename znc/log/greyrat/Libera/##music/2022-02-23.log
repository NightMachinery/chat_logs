[21:22:07] * Panther returns the salute
[21:22:25] * piercedwater smiles
[21:24:02] * Panther is wondering
[21:24:37] * piercedwater wonders what Panther is wondering about
[21:25:43] <Panther> If a platoon of M-7 'Priests' can hold off 2 platoons of heavy machine gun armed infantry with 3 platoons of halftrack mounted 81mm mortars.
[21:26:11] <Panther> The M-7s have 105mm howitzers and are armored.
[21:27:08] <Panther> They can fire indirectly, and have triple the range of the mortars.
[21:27:50] * Panther hasta get ready to start the show.
[21:33:43] <morlog> its the infantry that gets em
[21:35:10] <Panther> If they can get close enough, they can 'close assault' with grenades and the machine guns.. those M-7 are open topped.
[21:36:24] <morlog> small targets
[21:36:44] *** Quits: Awaru (Awaru@gateway/vpn/airvpn/awaru) (Quit: Awaru)
[21:36:50] <Panther> Still, the M-7 are faster, and can get away from them.
[21:37:00] *** Joins: Awaru (Awaru@gateway/vpn/airvpn/awaru)
[21:37:49] <morlog> kind of hard to fire a howitzer while its moving and they take time to set up
[21:38:00] <Panther> The halftracks are faster than the M-7s, but the mortars only have 1/3 the range, and one hit from a 105 would blow a halftrack to smithereens.
[21:38:51] <Panther> Yes, tho, they can quickly move out of range, set up, and fire before the inf. could march all the way to get in range.
[21:40:22] <Panther> The howitzers are mounted into the M-7 carriages, which are basically open topped tanks.
[21:40:33] <morlog> i know 
[21:40:50] <morlog> im familiar with these vehicles
[21:41:10] <Panther> I think you are right eventually, but in the right terrain, it would not be easy to corner them.
[21:41:17] <macrobat> egyptians will now prefer their ukranian bellydancers to their russian ones?
[21:41:34] <morlog> would have to be a giant flat open field
[21:43:46] <macrobat> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSUm3AfhsiQ
[21:43:51] <Panther> If the M-7 were in concealment on a hill, with a forward observer, I think they would dominate the terrain. Still, of the HMG inf did get close enough, the M-7 only has a little .50 cal mg for defense.
[21:43:52] <Janet> ^ mezdeke-shik shak shok - YouTube
[21:45:06] <Panther> You can get the 105s to use direct fire against them as they get close up to a point.
[21:45:45] <knots> so "Account Development Representative" from mongodb cold called me and started talking about setting up a meeting. I dont trust anyone calling me asking questions about my tech stack so i nicely told him that all the info he needs would be in the paperwork

[21:51:32] <Panther> A British self-propelled gun armed with the Ordnance QF 25-pounder in design from 1941 was nicknamed "the Bishop" as its appearance was said to resemble a bishop's mitre. A replacement, the US 105 Millimeter Howitzer Motor Carriage M7 was called "Priest" by the British, as part of its superstructure was said to resemble a priest's pulpit. Following this line of names, a 1942 self-propelled 
[21:51:32] <Panther> gun armed with the 57 mm QF 6 pounder was the Deacon, and a 1943 vehicle with the QF 25-pounder was the Sexton.
