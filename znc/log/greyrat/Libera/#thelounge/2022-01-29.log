[00:37:04] <johncs> If you follow this exactly what happens: focus the chat box, type hello, hold down shift, press enter, release shift, type world
[00:37:50] <Hess> something really weird has just happened: I typed /topic #channel to see the topic of #channel, which is a standard way of doing it, and I accidentally changed the topic of the channel to #channel
[00:39:21] <Hess> I get it that it's important to work on UX, but overriding actual IRC commands is another thing
[00:39:29] <johncs> That‚Äôs how the topic command works for the lounge, do all other clients also implement that alternate form?
[00:39:50] <bookworm> that is how the topic command works pretty much everywhere
[00:40:09] <bookworm> if im doubt, read the help
[00:40:11] <Hess> that is not how TOPIC works at all
[00:40:14] <Hess> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Internet_Relay_Chat_commands#TOPIC
[00:40:22] <Hess> TOPIC <#channel> [message]
[00:40:37] <Hess> to set or query the topic
[00:40:42] <Hess> this is standard IRC protocol
[00:40:51] <johncs> IRC protocol versus what we expose to users are different.
[00:41:05] <Hess> right, but our opinions about UX should not override standard IRC commands
[00:41:20] <Hess> come on, this is just getting in the way of users who are used to the protocol
[00:41:27] <johncs> i think they absolutely should.
[00:41:36] <bookworm> we do, if you want a one to one mapping use netcat
[00:41:52] <Hess> that's a fallacy, I didn't say abstractions are not important
[00:42:00] <Hess> I just said that the TOPIC command has an interface
[00:42:06] <bookworm> TL overrides quite a bunch of IRC commands if you don't like that you might not like TL
[00:42:07] <Hess> it's misleading to override it, to say the least
[00:42:15] <bookworm> yes, we have a different interface
[00:42:24] <bookworm> it's also documented
[00:42:47] <Hess> that's not how smart people should be doing software
[00:42:49] <bookworm> /topic [newtopic]
[00:42:51] <Hess> but ok
[00:42:57] <Hess> thanks
[00:43:06] <bookworm> it's not the goal of TL to mirror IRC one to one
[00:43:16] <Hess> I never said that, why do you keep repeating it?
[00:43:23] <Hess> I just said that it's not an abstraction
[00:43:46] <Hess> it's breaking an interface
[00:43:58] <bookworm> we don't expose low level IRC
[00:44:08] <bookworm> we abstract quite a lot of things
[00:44:09] *** Quits: eliocamp (~eliocamp@user/eliocamp) (Quit: The Lounge - https://thelounge.chat)
[00:44:19] <Hess> and that's quite important
[00:44:23] <bookworm> yes
[00:44:26] <johncs> Hess, do other clients support that form? If they do, you can open a PR to support it as well
[00:44:28] <Hess> however, you must have other power users too
[00:44:33] <Hess> of course
[00:44:39] <johncs> Then open a PR
[00:44:44] <Hess> ok
[00:44:51] <bookworm> I'd nack it
[00:45:02] <bookworm> the current UX has been this way for a long time
[00:45:31] <bookworm> you'd be breaking existing behavior for no good reason
[00:45:58] <Hess> well, we're all entitled to our opinions, but what I'm saying is that we should follow good principles of not breaking interfaces that are older than this very software
[00:46:01] <johncs> It'd only make it harder for someone to set the topic to exactly another channel name, it seems alright
[00:46:05] <Hess> we don't need to remove any abstraction
[00:46:08] <johncs> Hess I will definitely say your argument is absurd
[00:46:13] <johncs> but you're welcome to add the alternate form
[00:46:16] <Hess> just not get in the way of users who have been using IRC long before TL
[00:46:18] <johncs> At least I think so
[00:46:22] <johncs> Bookworm also gets a vote
[00:48:29] <Hess> well, I'm not wasting my time to be a prick opening a PR if older maintainers are already opposing it
[00:48:45] <Hess> it's just weird that you chose to override a standard IRC command instead of creating an alias like /t
[00:48:52] <Hess>  /t "New topic"
[00:48:52] <johncs> yea you said that
[00:49:03] <Hess> ok
[00:49:06] <bookworm> how is that a good UX? No one would know what the hell that is
[00:49:18] <Hess> do you know what an example is, bookworm?
[00:49:23] <bookworm> ...
[00:49:23] <Hess> I don't like /t either
[00:49:43] <Hess> I am just saying that real developers don't monkey patch things like that
[00:49:50] <Hess> but whatever
[00:49:59] <bookworm> "real developers", classy
[00:49:59] <Hess> that just pissed me off and I do apologize for being rude
[00:50:01] <johncs> second time you've insulted the devs of this
[00:50:06] <Hess> whatever
[00:50:09] <Hess> kick me out if you want
[00:50:24] <johncs> i won't, but i will say i'd rather you got lost
[00:50:29] <bookworm> do we really have to do that? Optionally we could just all be adults
[00:50:30] <Hess> ok
[00:50:39] <Hess> you're right

[01:53:30] <johncs> Yeah the argument they were making was really out there. The protocol on the wire shouldn't dictate what we expose to users. Like I'd love to see that argument on an XMPP client üòÇ. But I think they were really thinking that /topic behaves that way in so many other clients that we're breaking our user's expectations by doing something different.
[01:55:20] <johncs> Which I totally get. When I design UX I wanna avoid breaking established expectations like that. And when I do it I consider it a downside that I want to be offset by a bigger upside.
[01:59:27] <winter> johncs: was a custom css issue, whoops
