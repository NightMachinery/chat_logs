[01:23:23] <bobdobbs> Hi all. I set up yasnippet to work with web-mode many years ago. I haven't changed my config over that time, so basically I'm not sure how it works. Recently something that it has always been doing since I set it up has been bugging me: for some php snippets I get multiple candidates. I want to eliminate redundant candidates.
[01:23:36] *** Quits: haj1 (~haj@ip5f5beb42.dynamic.kabel-deutschland.de) (Quit: Leaving.)
[01:23:52] <bobdobbs> The particular snippet that I'm trying to eliminate multiple candidates for is php's 'if'.

[01:26:41] <bobdobbs> Interestingly, there are no files within the directory 'yasnippet/yasnippet-snippets/snippets/web-mode'
[01:29:36] <bobdobbs> Is there a way to determine where the candidates are being loaded from?

[16:22:19] <gxt> I need some help debugging a weird problem with (GUI) emacs completely losing keyboard focus after interacting with a menu or dialog.
[16:24:13] <thblt> ,anyone
[16:24:13] <fsbot`> Just ask your question. It's the best way to know if anyone can help. https://sol.gfxile.net/dontask.html
[16:24:17] <gxt> If I have the menu bar enabled, I can still save everything and exit using it, else I can apparently only close emacs forcefully. Emacs is still responsive, clicking in different buffers makes them active and moves the point, but I don't get the filled-out cursor, only the hollow "no-focus" one
[16:24:45] <thblt> gxt: OS, platform, emacs version, and so on plz?

[16:28:01] <gxt> thblt: Yes
[16:29:10] <thblt> This may be a Phosh issue.  I'v seen focus issues with xwayland programs already.  Have you tried searching for xwayland phosh focus bugs?

[19:06:08] <twrk> so, it seems a common process for a mode or package to do is a) take buffer b) put into process of another program (maybe in another buffer?) c) spit back results... and I think usually you can see the "processing buffer" in ibuffer or w/e C-x b opens, but is there any sort of "task manager of packages" I don't know about? Actual case: I'm using format-all package to format an R script file. It invokes R, uses the `styler` library,

I install the `styler` package in an R interpreter in emacs, but rerunning format-all on the buffer still tells me the package isn't installed... so, without going to the source, I was wondering if there were an already *open process* I can't see (in ibuffer).

[20:54:07] <johnjay> sure sometimes modal dialogs are necessary. with emacs the only one that stands out to me is the quit one where it asks you if you want to close all and quit like 2 or 3 times
[20:54:11] <rpav> like i love multiple-cursors but the "run this for every? y/n" i often just hit "n" and don't think about it, which is often the wrong choice ;/
[20:54:31] <thblt> mfiano: Try (let ((current-prefix-arg (4))) (call-interactively 'function))
[20:54:39] <johnjay> see that doesn't even need to be a modal dialog
[20:54:50] <mfiano> I'm trying to define a key binding to call a command as if it was given a universal argument but without doing so.
[20:54:54] <mfiano> What is 4?
[20:54:56] <johnjay> just have a window on the side unobstrusive asking in future should this always happen y/n?
[20:55:00] <rpav> johnjay: i'm not sure with a properly-designed UI modal dialogs are _ever_ necessary
[20:55:15] <thblt> mfiano: but that' a bit weird. Just create a lambda and call your func with the arguments you want.

[20:55:34] <johnjay> right. i agree. but sometimes you really do need the user input on what to do, and you couldn't have predicted it, and you need an immediate answer
[20:55:40] <thblt> That should be '(4)
[20:55:52] <johnjay> like if backups fail and you have to close program and you need user to confirm they lost their work or something
[20:55:56] <thblt> '(4) is the universal argument, mfiano :)
[20:55:59] <mfiano> I just want C-b b to behave as if I called C-u C-b b
[20:56:17] <rpav> e.g. dropdown menus are modal, and we're all ingrained with how they work, but i'm not sure they're actually very good
[20:56:28] <johnjay> dropdown menu is voluntary though
[20:56:32] <johnjay> you have to choose to view it
[20:56:46] <johnjay> modal dialogs are forced, stop you from doing any other task, and demand an immedate answer
[20:56:55] <thblt> mfiano: what's c-b b? 
[20:57:03] <thblt> C-b is not a prefix here
[20:57:07] <rpav> johnjay: sure but in the case of "really delete?" it's not really modal per se .. i.e there's no reason the user can't continue to operate on the data, and resolve the operation at their time of choosing
[20:57:47] <johnjay> sure. i'd also like it if dialogs always had the "never show this again" more often
[20:57:55] <rpav> yeah
[20:57:57] <johnjay> because too often you get into situations where you are repeatedly having to click them
[20:58:01] <mfiano> Sorry C-c b
[20:58:08] <rpav> also for any text anywhere to be selectable, but that's a separate tangent ;)

[21:02:29] <thblt> mfiano: that would be (lambda () (interactive) (foo 4)) or (foo ('4))
[21:03:17] <thblt> But it's always better to name your functions, so (define-key some-map (kbd "C-c U") (defun super-foo () (interactive) (foo (4)))
[21:03:25] <rpav> isn't it just like
[21:03:28] <rpav> (defun call-interactively-with-prefix (fun &optional prefix) (let ((current-prefix-arg (or prefix 1))) (call-interactively fun)))
[21:03:41] <gnoo> or (call-interactively (key-binding "C-c b"))
[21:03:51] <mfiano> Ok, so 4 is considered the universal argument, and interactive functions receive their prefix arguments like non-interactive functions receive their regular arguments?
[21:04:12] <thblt> If you really want to fake a universal arg, just  (define-key some-map (kbd "C-c U") (defun super-foo () (interactive) (let ((current-prefix-arg '(4))) (call-interactively 'foo)))
[21:04:15] <rpav> i thought 1 was the default universal argument, or -1 if you used the other version .. maybe -1 is the default
[21:04:48] <thblt> rpav: C-u is '(4).  The universal arg is a *list*, not just a number.
[21:05:04] <rpav> ah
[21:05:10] <rpav> well, adapt above as appropriate
[21:05:29] <rpav> i suppose they just used getRandomNumber()
[21:05:29] <thblt> mfiano: yes, interactive commands just have rules to bind their arguments. 
[21:06:00] <mfiano> That clears things up, thanks.
[21:06:11] <thblt> rpav: It's just for the case where you want to distinguish between numeric and universal, while keeping universal usable as numeric.

[22:59:42] <bremner> well, I don't have running multics system.
[22:59:50] <pmetzger> Anyway, Lisp Machines had EINE and then ZWEI and RMS worked under that system for a while.
[23:00:11] <pmetzger> All the people in that lab were lisp fanatics so the idea of using lisp as the extension language too was pretty natural.

[23:00:23] *** Joins: jactry (~jactry@user/jactry)
[23:00:37] <bremner> right. 
[23:00:43] <pmetzger> When RMS rebuilt Emacs for Unix elisp was born. It's hideous of course.
[23:00:54] <pmetzger> The worst lisp in current everyday use.
[23:00:58] <pjb> Too bad CL wasn't ready yet.

[23:01:07] <pmetzger> Its an ugly baby, but it's our ugly baby.
[23:01:08] <bremner> pmetzger: worse than autolisp?
[23:01:13] <pjb> If RMS had found a CL implementation targetting various unix systems, he may have used it.
[23:01:19] <pmetzger> autolisp might be worse, I've never touched it.
[23:01:24] <pjb> it is worse.
[23:01:31] <pjb> autolisp.
[23:01:33] <bremner> pjb: only if it was free software, which it probably wasn't
[23:01:39] <pmetzger> Scheme was already around but for some reason the notion that lexical binding could be efficient literally hadn't crossed the hall to him.
[23:01:56] <pjb> bremner: well, there were early CL implementations that were free enough, like CMU CL.
[23:02:00] <pmetzger> Scheme existed from the mid-1970s.
[23:02:22] <pmetzger> KCL. Kyoto Common Lisp. But I'm not sure KCL already existed when RMS built elisp.
[23:02:48] <pmetzger> RMS probably was aware of the Common Lisp standards effort, but maybe he wasn't aware enough to know that lexical scope was now all the rage.
[23:03:06] <pjb> exactly.
[23:03:13] <pmetzger> The thing that I still really miss is proper tail recursion. I think that can still be retrofitted into elisp.

[23:16:29] <pmetzger> But essentially every modern functional language has TCO.
[23:16:43] <pjb> johnjay: CL is  a language, it doesn't do optimization. Implementations may or may not implement optimizations.
[23:17:03] <pmetzger> With pattern matching and TCO it's possible to program in a much more elegant style.
[23:17:25] <pmetzger> Scheme is a language, but the language spec imposes TCO. Many languages are required to do TCO.
[23:17:31] <pmetzger> Some even to TRMC.
