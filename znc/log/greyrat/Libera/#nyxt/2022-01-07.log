[04:58:12] <qhong-> Does get-document-body-json produce json encoding of the whole document (including <head>) rather than just the <body> node?
[04:59:18] <qhong-> correspondingly, document-model contains the DOM of the whole <html> node?

[08:03:36] <jmercouris> qhong: yes
[08:05:39] <qhong> jmercouris: got it, thanks!
[08:05:52] <jmercouris> no problem!
[08:06:00] <jmercouris> qhong: how is your hooks patch coming along?
[08:12:01] <qhong> jmercouris: Ha, it's currently being entangled with my structural editor effort, which is a rather big project. But I probably should decouple them and submit the hooks part first
[08:13:17] <jmercouris> yes, probably
[08:13:27] <jmercouris> so your structural editor will be built in Nyxt?
[08:13:37] <jmercouris> that sounds rather cool
[08:15:23] <qhong> jmercouris: yes that's the goal
[08:15:37] <qhong> although there're probably lots of problems to solve along the way
[08:17:12] <qhong> my vision is that we would have code=data=document in Nyxt. One should be able to use the structural editor to navigate in the DOM of arbitrary web page, and `M-x print-node` to splice an editable S-expr just in place, then `M-x read-node` to unsplice the edited S-expr back into the document

[09:16:24] <jmercouris> qhong: ah, interesting
[09:16:32] <jmercouris> that's a challenge
[09:28:14] <qhong> jmercouris: proposal 5 (fixing disable/re-enabling order) will likely break backward compatibility slightly. The way I do it is to use a handler-alist (with elements (HANDLER . ENABLE-P)) instead of two separate list handlers and disabled-handlers. I could simulate readers of handlers and disabled-handlers, but it's not easy to simulate the writers. Thoughts?
[09:28:44] <jmercouris> qhong: don't worry about breaking backward compatibility, master is to become 3.0.0
[09:29:18] <jmercouris> why a single list instead of two? are there any benefits?
[09:29:47] <jmercouris> qhong: backwards compatible changes are all on the `2-series` branch
[09:29:51] <qhong> it's then trivial to retain order when disable and re-enabling
[09:30:00] <qhong> hooks is in serapeum contrib, though
[09:30:01] <jmercouris> qhong: aha, I see
[09:30:26] <jmercouris> qhong: that is still fine, we will run a submodule of our own until it is merged upstream
[09:30:31] <jmercouris> that is what we always do
[09:30:40] <qhong> sure, sounds good!
[09:30:41] <jmercouris> if it is not to be merged upstream, then we can just continue to use our submodule

[17:08:30] <Kabouik> Thanks aartaka and ardon for figuring out what was the issue with touch input in vi-mode, silly me didn't even think of trying Emacs mode despite being struggling with this issue since more than a month.
[17:08:41] <Kabouik> At least I'm glad that it was an actual bug, not a local issue on my end.

[21:50:00] <mariari> jmercouris: is nyxt more stable now? Haven't gotten a crash today, nor yesterday, though may be because of lower than normal usage of these past few days
[21:50:20] <jmercouris> mariari: I canâ€™t say
[21:50:28] <jmercouris> I believe Nyxt is more stable yes
[21:50:34] <mariari> hmm, wonder why it feels so stable then
[21:50:42] <mariari> any particular commit?
[21:51:03] <jmercouris> Not sure
[21:51:18] <jmercouris> I donâ€™t exactly understand why it was crashing for you to begin with :-D
[21:51:26] <jmercouris> Weâ€™ve fixed many potential crashes lately though
[21:51:30] <mariari> I think it's webkit constantly failing hard
[21:51:47] <mariari> also for a lil bit any allocation can cause it to run out of memory
[21:51:54] <mariari> those both seem gone? I'll have to use nyxt more
[21:51:54] <waleee> wasn't the default heap size increased in the makefile?
[21:51:59] <jmercouris> Yes it was
[21:52:04] <jmercouris> To 3GiB
[21:52:05] <mariari> that might have fixed the 2nd class of dumps
[21:52:10] <jmercouris> Well, the maximum heap size
[21:52:16] <mariari> the first calss of bugs should still be crashing
[21:52:23] <mariari> since my webkit version hasn't been changed
[21:52:33] <jmercouris> Ay yai yai Jeremyito
[21:52:50] <jmercouris> Iâ€™m not certain:-O
[21:54:05] <mariari> Well it's a good sign!
