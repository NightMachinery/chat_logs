But in a clean Emacs config, the Save action isn't listed under the State button, yet I can still click "Apply and Save" for the whole buffer at the top.  I haven't been able to figure out what I did in my main config to enable that per-option saving.

[02:45:31] <dale> Guest7184: I think you have to invoke byte compilation on a .el file, which produces the .elc file, before async native comp will kick in and also create a .eln file.  I don't know if you can then remove the .elc file and then still use the .eln file.
[02:45:39] <acdw> LOL nice
[02:45:47] <Guest7184> As far as I know I made nothing "wrong" in my config.  Ain't that a bug that somehow the "test scan for errors" ends up scanning the .eln instead of the .el to try to see if sexps are correctly balanced?

[02:46:28] <aidalgol> Compiling your init file is probably not going to save you much time, either.
[02:46:48] <Guest7184> ok but how do I compile everything, besides my init.el file ?
[02:46:59] <aidalgol> Deferring loading of packages as much as possible is going to make more of a difference, I think.
[02:47:00] <technomancy> it's a bug that's only triggered by unusual behavior but it's definitely broken
[02:47:00] <dale> Guest7184: Alternatively you could try setting custom-file to some other .el file, like I do, and make sure not to byte compile that one.  It'd probably fix your problem as well.

[02:48:55] <arch> And while you can byte-compile it on things that are exceptionally slow, you'll usually not see much of a difference
[02:49:07] <himesama> what proportion of experienced emacs users do you think have a single .emacs or equivalent, and no files of their own that are called by it?  i'd say probably pretty low.  .emacs can be byte-compiles, but i don't see the point.  in my case it is a tiny file calling another file that calls a lot of files.

[04:53:45] <Guest711> ain't that a problem ?
[04:53:53] <alphapapa[m]> I don't understand why anyone would do that.  The customization system is a strength of Emacs, unmatched in other software AFAIK.  It's powerful for users and developers alike.

[05:16:30] <alphapapa[m]> ajak: There is reason to: when I clone my Emacs config to another machine, all the packages are already byte-compiled.
[05:16:43] <Guest711> grum: for a bare git repo that is (emacsdotd.git I named it ; )
[05:16:48] <grym> Guest711: i commit that which is used to tell straight to pull in that 800 MB of history :_
[05:17:18] <grym> but those are someone _else's_ repos, not mine :)
[05:17:56] <arch> My git-committed config is tiny--but it also can break deploying if melpa is doing something silly when I put it on another computer
[05:18:22] <arch> I probably could get away with just using straight for everything
[05:18:44] <alphapapa[m]> Maybe it would help to think of ELC files as Java bytecode files: to throw them away and regenerate them on every machine would be pretty pointless.  The bytecode is intended to be portable.
[05:19:01] <Guest711> himesama: they're the natively compiled files, when you run the "native-comp" branch of Emacs (it is noticeably snappier)

[05:20:44] <alphapapa[m]> Yes, the config goes with the packages, together.
[05:21:05] <alphapapa[m]> It's a known-good configuration, including package versions that are known to work in it and together.

[06:30:22] <alphapapa[m]> I have general concern that they will add too much to the spec and bloat it, because they're tempted to compete with the likes of Slack and Discord and MS Teams.  But at least it's an open protocol, and clients can ignore events they don't want to render.
[06:30:33] <acdw> but we need GIFS
[06:30:49] <alphapapa[m]> Like, how much worse than HTTP could it become?  (don't answer that)

[07:43:10] <Viking667> Ahh, THAT stuff. I'd forgotten that. I've seen it in bars.
[07:43:22] <grym> "good ol' raisins and peanuts"
[07:43:29] <twb> "trail mix" is not a thing in my country
[07:43:50] <grym> something something anzac biscuits
[07:43:52] <twb> we have... museli?  Which is rolled oats and fruit and maybe nuts
[07:44:08] <himesama> also your glom hints at agglomerate --- 20:06 <himesama> portmanteau --- 20:00 <Viking667> lol, and you wouldn't have got anywhere. It's not German, it's ... uhm.... I don't know what that term is when you glom a whole lot of things together into a composite word.
[07:44:12] <oats> I fuckin love muesli
[07:44:23] <oats> I have it with yogurt most mornings
[07:44:31] <twb> anzac biscuits are basically pulped and baked oats I think
[07:44:57] <grym> why have a portmanteau when you can have ALL of them at once? http://tom7.org/portmantout/

[07:45:09] <Viking667> (or perhaps molasses.

[07:46:10] <bpalmer> portmanteau is a bit different than a compound word.
[07:46:12] <twb> "aramid" ain't a portmanteau, though it looks it
[07:46:15] <alphapapa[m]> grym: Okay, that's impressive.  Now, see, why don't these memory "athletes" memorize that instead of useless digits of pi...
[07:46:21] <bpalmer> at least in English.
[07:46:24] <tali713> yes

[07:46:49] <bpalmer> Viking667: for example, 'motorhotel' is a plausible compound word (usually would be written as 'motor hotel'), but 'motel' is the portmanteau.
[07:46:51] <alphapapa[m]> Imagine how entertaining it would be to have a memory competitor recite a 611k letter portmanteau of every word in the English language!
[07:47:27] <grym> alphapapa[m]: (all his other stuff is equally crazy good)

[07:48:09] <himesama> by the time you are done there will be a tagalog swahili portmanteau added to english, adorkably

[07:48:35] <Viking667> From the Collins dictionary: portmanteau  n. pl portmanteaus or portmanteaux .... 2. (modifier) embodying several uses or qualities: (it) the heroine is a portmanteau figure of all the virtues...
[07:48:38] <alphapapa[m]> cool, he seems really talented
[07:49:11] <alphapapa[m]> the way he teaches in some of his videos is really impressive, the drawing on a big sheet of paper seemingly without much advance planning (he probably does before the video, or if not, really wow)
[07:49:38] <grym> well, when you write your dissertation in twelf 
[07:49:48] <grym> you've got a pretty special kind of head

[12:19:11] <kilobug> dragestil: ah yeah you can just remove the localhost, and if your username is the same on remote host (or setup in .ssh/config) you can omit it too, and root can be omited too which means just /ssh:host|sudo::/path/to/file will work in many cases
[12:19:38] <dragestil> another thing with eshell + tramp is the environment is still the local machine, like if I type `ls /` it will list the root of local machine

[12:21:37] <kilobug> dragestil: with eshell it's elisp code running inside your emacs, so you'll need to use the tramp path to access remote files; you can use M-x shell if you want to run a "real" shell on remote host within emacs

[12:22:05] <kilobug> dragestil: but to be fair I rarely do so, I've (many) "regular" terminals in addition to Emacs, and I use screen in them
[12:22:59] <dragestil> with shell mode (M-x shell) it's harder to edit files on remote machine
[12:23:00] <trace987> When you learn something, you start with very small applications of it, when you do learning by doing. What small easy applications has emacs to start with, if you start learning emacs by learning by doing?
[12:23:21] <dragestil> with eshell + tramp at least you can do find-file
[12:24:18] <dragestil> like `find-file ./readme` in the prompt
[12:24:24] <kilobug> trace987: well, emacs is very large and offer many many things, it really depends of what kind of usage you've in mind/what your needs are

I once proposed to add Elexandria.el to MELPA under the package name "el", but they kind of resisted that idea, can't blame them really.  CL, well, not as much as I think I'd like to, but I hope to do more.  I'm pretty fond of Elisp, actually, but it has its obvious weaknesses.
[14:14:41] <makomo> alphapapa[m]: yeah, true, he's got his own priorities. i'll definitely let you know if i have any feedback :)
[14:15:20] <alphapapa[m]> makomo: What I can tell you is that all the plz.el tests pass.  :)  One thing you should be aware of, that I'll eventually document, is that using Curl as a backend means some values MUST be passed via the command line, and that could mean, e.g. leaking secrets
[14:16:00] <alphapapa[m]> Unfortunately there's no way around that.  I found a very old post on the curl mailing list proposing solutions to that, but they were all shot down as not really a problem that needed to be solved, which I was really disappointed to see.

[14:17:07] <makomo> ah ok, thanks :D
[14:17:29] <alphapapa[m]> I think it was mentioned on emacs-devel since then, and Lars said something along the lines of, "yeah, yeah, I'll get to it..."  :)
[14:18:03] <alphapapa[m]> but as skeeto's comments point out, perhaps, I don't know if wrapping url-retrieve in a macro can fix all of the issues it has
[14:18:20] <alphapapa[m]> I'm having fun with plz.el anyway
[14:19:27] <makomo> hehe, that's good. elisp is fun :D
[14:19:43] <makomo> alphapapa[m]: is there a summary of these url lib issues somewhere?
[14:21:02] <alphapapa[m]> er, not a canonical one that I know of... maybe I should have collected links to discussions over the years... you can see some issues mentioned in the comments in the elexandria.el function that calls it... and I think there are various discussions on r/emacs over the years... probably some comments on the request.el repo over the years... and surely on emacs-devel, but searching that can be hard

[14:21:31] <alphapapa[m]> probably some debbugs about it too, but, again, searching... (AFAIK you can only really search bug subjects)
[14:22:14] <alphapapa[m]> I think the bottom line, is that it's not very reliable for async purposes.  e.g. callbacks can be called multiple times or not at all, stuff like that.

[14:23:27] <makomo> alphapapa[m]: aha, i see. i *think* i remember reading something along those lines when i was reading the url manual.
[14:23:37] <alphapapa[m]> in matrix-client.el I managed to wrap it with a macro/function (I forget which) like that in elexandria.el that made it reliable for my purposes, but then I had to use request.el for certain HTTP request types that url.el just wouldn't work with... and request.el has its own issues... so I followed XKCD #whatever's advice and made yet another elisp curl wrapper

[14:24:06] <alphapapa[m]> makomo: ...and now you're teaching me, because I didn't even realize url.el had an info manual
[14:24:45] <alphapapa[m]> sometimes it feels inconvenient for these libraries to have their own, separate manuals... not very discoverable compared to searching the Elisp one
[14:25:05] <makomo> alphapapa[m]: hahaha, i hope i remember right

[14:26:46] <alphapapa[m]> the url.info introduction is kind of charming

[14:43:25] <alphapapa[m]> that kind of limits its compatibility, I guess

[16:10:24] <Viking667> If I've included (setq custom-file (concat user-emacs-directory "custom.el")) in my .emacs.el, how do I get emacs to use that? Or will it use it automatically?
[16:11:24] <MysteriousSilver> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[16:12:19] <makomo> Viking667: iirc, setting the variable is all that's required for Customize to write your customizations to the file, but i think the file has to be loaded manually at startup
[16:12:25] <gnooooo> peder: what are you using -n and -t for? You want one to override other?
[16:12:32] <peder> Viking667: (load custom-file t t t)

[16:13:23] <Viking667> heh, I'm working off someone else's instructions here, and if my IQ was emacs experience, I'd be in the low units at the moment.
[16:13:52] <Viking667> well, I've noted that setting that var then customising something does write stuff to custom.el
[16:13:52] <edgar-rft> Viking667: user-emacs-directory might contain shell abbreviations like "~/" for the $HOME directory, so if (load custom-file) doesn't work (load (expand-file-name custom-file)) should work.

[16:14:55] <chrisb> is auth in smtpmail broken for anyone else?
[16:14:55] <makomo> or you can deal with that just by setting custom-file to something expanded already, rather than when loading :)
[16:15:02] <peder> gnooooo: well... i would like -nw to actually start a frame in the terminal even with -n, so i can have an alias that always uses -n ;)
[16:15:31] <makomo> Viking667: pretty much, yep
[16:15:48] <Viking667> I just wish that customize-* would leave embedded comments alone. I was trying to include stuff into an emacs.org settings document, and regenning it with C-c C-v t gets blottoed by customize-*

[16:33:14] <wasamasa> it is slow, has awful UX, conversion generates suboptimal output and the book management part isn't my thing at all
[16:33:28] <wasamasa> the only upside is that you can use it to preview ebooks of all kinds and do dedrm with it
[16:33:47] <Viking667> yah, it was until recently the only ebook reader I had any experience with.

[21:53:47] <bpalmer> Yes. Generally I've had to choose between django and flask.
[21:53:57] <grym> my general understanding being that django is for people who want websites, and i generally don't
[21:54:09] <bpalmer> And, for all that django is commonly supported and has a lot of nice features, flask seems quicker to get something lightweight up quickly
[21:54:32] <mydraal> Fastapi is pretty great. And with fastapi-crud on top of it, it really reduces time to write apis
[21:54:33] <grym> yeah.  i usually have less than 5 endpoints and no need to emit html
[21:55:23] <bpalmer> there's probably something out there in go to cut down on writing boiler plate, but one gets used to some amount of that in go
