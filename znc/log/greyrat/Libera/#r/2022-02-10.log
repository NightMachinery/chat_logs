[00:14:43] <Bayes> who that
[00:29:16] <fendur> devtools
[00:33:05] <Bayes> lol
[00:33:17] <Bayes> there's something super weird with this setup tho
[00:34:29] <Bayes> like I installed all the packages I need, but when I run my stuff I get there is no package called ‘Rcpp’ Calls: :: ... loadNamespace -> withRestarts -> withOneRestart -> doWithOneRestart
[00:35:07] <Bayes> so the question is... if it is a dependence, it should be installed. if it's not a dependence, it shouldn't fail ?
[00:38:13] <brj> IME, it's always something to do with paths
[00:38:58] <Bayes> yeah it probably is the case
[00:39:02] <Bayes> but why tho
[00:40:01] <Bayes> frustrating :/
[00:40:40] <brj> .Rprofile shenanigans?

[00:43:35] <Bayes> don't think so, I even set the .libPath() top of the script
[00:43:58] <Bayes> what's throwing me off is that Rcpp is not part of the dependency tree
[00:44:11] <Bayes> otherwise install.packages shoulda taken care of that
[00:45:43] <brj> Hmm
[00:46:07] <brj> Those are my usual suspects. Rcpp can be tricky though, is DESCRIPTION updated?
[00:46:31] <Bayes> so I'm in the process of... "run the script", "wait for error", "install missing dependency by hand", restart
[00:46:48] <Bayes> now it's there is no package called ‘magrittr’ lol
[01:05:21] <Bayes> whatev I nuked the whole lib and I'm rebuilding this from scratch
[01:05:35] <Bayes> what a pain in the neck to be dealing with this instead of getting the stuff running but it's what it is

[17:18:16] <dgg> Hi there
[17:18:27] <fendur> o/
[17:18:42] *** dgg is now known as __that__
[17:20:26] <__that__> I would like to run a shapiro-wilk test on various sets of observations that are organised as columns in a dataframe. What would the canonical way of checking this in R be?
[17:20:36] <__that__> or what would you suggest to do?
[17:21:19] <fendur> https://www.r-bloggers.com/2019/08/shapiro-wilk-test-for-normality-in-r/
[17:21:22] <fendur> that seems like a good start
[17:21:42] <fendur> unless your question is asbout how to repeat it and organize the results.
[17:21:44] <__that__> fendur, sure I know how to do those tests in R
[17:21:54] <__that__> exactly, it is about the second question
[17:22:11] <__that__> I am still fighting with lapply, sapply, vapply, etc...
[17:22:17] <fendur> i'd do it with sapply and, therefore, auto organize the results in a named list
[17:22:55] <__that__> ta
[17:23:42] <fendur> if you have a character vector of column names (or a numeric vector of column indices) called "fields", then sapply(fields, function(f) shapiro.test(df[,f]))
[17:24:14] <fendur> you _may_ have to specific simplify=F in the sapply to avoid some attempt to simplify the result structure
[17:24:39] <fendur> lapply by default does not try to do that, but lapply also doesn't carry the input forward into the result, so you lose the field names, I think.
[17:24:58] <fendur> specify*

[18:09:57] <__that__> is there anyone here that have coded in other languages beyond R? I just feel R is pretty useful for stats but as a language is pretty primitive. Does anyone share my views?
[18:12:03] <__that__> When plotting a dataframe, I get a matrix of graphs where the correlation of every pair of variables are compared. Is there anyway to create rows and column numbers as part of that matrix of graphs
[18:12:10] <__that__> then it is easier to refer to them in a text

[19:48:28] <Bayes> brj hey, yeah it worked thanks. I wiped the whole user library and reinstalled the packages I needed from scratch, which in turns had CRAN install a huge pile of packages
[19:49:40] <Bayes> philectro ikr, it's kinda crazy that a package from CRAN will read a .txt hosted on a personal site
[19:50:19] <philectro> i am personnaly bothered by rstudio using tinytex in personnal folders instead of fulltexlive
[19:50:30] <philectro> even when texlive is installed
[19:50:44] <Bayes> I mean, I do understand that it's a highly reputable user in the community, I do understand that an institutional website need not be more secure than a personal one, and I do understand that there's an advantage of having that file to be remotely available instead of include it in the package itself
[19:50:53] <Bayes> but anyway, maybe I'm overthinking this
[19:51:08] <Bayes> ah, is that what it does?
[19:51:35] <Bayes> I've been slowly trying to use as little rstudio as possible, so far reduced it exclusively to R programming
[19:52:28] <Bayes> I'm staying out of Rmarkdown and Rbookdown and all the whole family for anything that I care, only use it for those projects that "need to get things done to foot the bill" but I wouldn't care of otherwise :P

[21:16:11] <fendur> that's what our sponsors like!
[21:17:03] <confuzeus> true. 
[21:23:55] <fendur> we literally put 1 team member's entire week towards getting the working-animation right (the thing that spins to indicate "I'm working"). That's where we are, folks.
[21:24:45] <fendur> not "right" as in functioned correctly, but looked ideal.
[21:28:48] <confuzeus> we have to pay some company whose job is graphic design to make sure that reports are to exact funder specifications. the good thing is that i do not worry about getting the reports and graphs super colourful as the design team will clone graphs and add the appropriate colours.
[21:30:31] <confuzeus> coincidentally, i also become slightly cheaper as i can only charge for the actual work and nothing more
[21:30:47] <Bayes> ^ interesting
[21:30:49] <Bayes> if I may change topic a bit ...
[21:30:59] <Bayes> I just recalled a conversation I was having earlier this week
[21:31:58] <Bayes> so as statisticians, or data scientists, or whatever you consider yourself... sometimes our role in collaborations is more like supporters, the quantitative side of things in a collab
[21:32:58] <Bayes> so you have to deal with all the things that come attach like data quality, scientists pushing for fitting thousand models and trying everything and changing their discourse on the go as they may not find first what they expected, etc
[21:33:38] <Bayes> but as a statistician you cannot really question the domain-specific science of the problem but the methodological side

[21:34:25] <Bayes> so it's kinda limited in what you can do to right the ship
[21:35:00] <Bayes> I wonder if there's a way to address such situations
[21:35:27] <Bayes> cause it really sucks when you're in a team like that
[21:36:11] <Bayes> if rickyrick were online... I can already read the "change team" trolling lol
[21:37:10] <fendur> i am usually taking teh due diligence approach of speaking up when i know something the team clearly doesn't, and recognizing (and verbally acknowledging) that they may not choose to take my advice. I also often point to expected reviewer concerns that i have experience with.
[21:37:38] <fendur> in the end, they pay me and im happy with the pay and myself for saying what i was paid to say, whether they take the advice or not
[21:37:52] <Bayes> hmm
[21:38:41] <Bayes> anticipating reviewer concerns is something we also do, it's a way to bring up your concerns without having people attack you and give such concerns a bit more consideration lol
[21:38:45] <fendur> i spend grad school actually worrying about those things. now i just say those things and let someone else choose whether to worry
[21:39:21] <Bayes> the second part... I don't know I can take the money and be happy with it, cause inside it feels really lame to work like that
[21:39:23] <fendur> to me it's the only sustainable way
[21:39:54] <fendur> im not into the role of statistician like i used to be, and im not into science like i used to be. So maybe that's why it's easier for me to take that route
[21:40:30] <Bayes> yeah sounds like you shifted mindset
[21:40:42] <fendur> i got more practical
[21:40:45] <fendur> and had a kid :)
[21:40:49] <confuzeus> my big stick in disagreements that i strongly i am right (like methods/data findings) and if i am being defeated by the domain team is to tell them that i go with their suggestion but if it is questioned, i will not defend the position.
[21:40:54] <fendur> (not that i tihnk "having a kid" is practical)
[21:41:13] <Bayes> heh so far I don't think we're going for a kid so maybe I'll never get to that tipping point
[21:41:20] * Bayes won't cave in, at least not this week
[21:41:26] <fendur> confuzeus: yep that's essentially what i mean, too. i get it off my chest and onto theirs.
[21:42:22] <Bayes> ok I'm really vocal, I don't really care much about being the old man yelling at clouds, and I try to be vocal and constructive and specific and as far as I can give actionable suggestions
[21:42:27] <fendur> so long as i feel i've expressed the gravity of the situation, I feel like it's on them to decide (and usually it IS on them to decide, because they are the ones with the power).
[21:42:34] <Bayes> so that's really not my proble, I get it off my chest every time
[21:42:49] <Bayes> but I struggle with the second part, feeling happy with it
[21:43:15] <fendur> Bayes: i guess im not telling the whole story if i say it never bothers me if im ignored.
[21:43:16] <Bayes> it feels like it was not a good job, or at least that it was not as carefully treated as I would have liked
[21:43:43] <Bayes> like "sucks that they're settling with so little"
[21:43:47] <fendur> Bayes: and if they constantly ignore me, and i feel like my role starts to be come simple technician, then i probably step away.
[21:44:05] <Bayes> no, I gotcha, it's usually not that extreme
[21:44:26] <Bayes> but you know, you end up with a paper you don't like much and you wouldn't put much effort in defending it as confuzeus said
[21:44:38] <confuzeus> the issue is that negative findings might cause the funder to cane the project so it is difficult for domain folk to write negative conclusions...
[21:45:15] <fendur> Bayes: i have removed my name from papers before and still would. i don't have any reason to care about my pub count.
[21:45:49] <Bayes> yeah that's really a way to approach it
[21:45:56] <Bayes> I mean pub count really sucks
[21:46:12] <fendur> it can be construed as a slap in the face to other authors, though. so im judicious with that move :)
[21:46:46] <Bayes> I was gonna say that, I know of one such case where things got... a bit too hot
[21:48:04] <fendur> as long as my argument is sound, though, it's pretty clear why I would prefer to be removed and no one minds, and they probably think im crazy because they think I shuold care about getting pubs.
[21:48:49] <Bayes> "gah, bohemians"
[21:48:59] <fendur> lol

[21:56:12] <Bayes> in the end I think I might sometimes be a bit overzealous with my time
[21:56:30] <Bayes> as in... "you're not trying hard enough to get this one right, don't waste my time" lol
[21:57:22] <fendur> it can be a curse or a virtue... 
[21:57:36] <fendur> decide what works for you
[21:57:55] <Bayes> I see the former, the latter tho....
[21:59:15] <fendur> it could feasibly work for you emotionally and financially to grind against the grain.
[22:00:29] <fendur> if you're prepared for the associated challenges. i suppose im not.
[22:03:26] <fendur> i choose to believe that is not failure. :)
[22:04:16] <fendur> portable goal post.
