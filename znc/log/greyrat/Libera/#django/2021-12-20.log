[01:58:58] <hyper_dave> I have a huge data on a single model with timestamps and foriegnkeys (14 million rows). So let's say the model in M and the foreignkey objects are appended letters (filtered). So if "MAB" values are like [1,1,1,2,2,2,2,3,3], I want to keep the first and last occurences. ie. [1,1,2,2,3,3], and so forth for each relation. Any tips on how to do it efficiently
[02:10:21] *** Joins: blackout69 (~blackout6@net-31-156-121-187.cust.vodafonedsl.it)
[02:11:39] <duoi> hyper_dave can you explain further? i'm not following with "MAB" unless my traceback is missing more detail
[02:12:10] <duoi> oh, i think i understand
[02:15:14] <hyper_dave> The foriegnkeys are not to much. Now that I think of it I can reduce it to around 300 time series data (filtered) It is indexed so that wouldn't be much issue..
[02:17:03] <hyper_dave> My problem is how I could delete the redundant data efficiently with out looking into every entry.
[02:17:44] <duoi> https://dpaste.org/qyjS maybe something like this? im not sure, its 23:47 here and ive been drinking :p

[12:31:02] <LordKalma> out of curiosity, have any of you used like DRF to serve like blog posts?
[12:31:12] <LordKalma> but with like, rich text, like with tiny-mce or something
[12:33:41] <serafeim> not me but it shouldn't be difficult
[12:33:47] <LordKalma> I'm jusdt curious
[12:33:49] <serafeim> also wagtail does exactly that (using wagtail headless)
[12:33:53] <LordKalma> does the API like serve html?
[12:34:00] <serafeim> why not  ?
[12:34:01] <LordKalma> htmo-as-string
[12:34:16] <LordKalma> *html-as-string
[12:34:19] <LordKalma> serafeim, just curious
[12:34:26] <serafeim> yes it will work
[12:34:30] <LordKalma> wagtail is nice, but I'm building a full custom thing
[12:34:38] <LordKalma> which sometimes I regret, sometimes I like :)
[12:34:47] <serafeim> wagtail is great
[12:35:18] <LordKalma> I'm using a JS SPA
[12:35:25] <serafeim> it also supports js spa
[12:35:49] <LordKalma> well, not I'm stuck with my half made project haha
[12:36:09] <serafeim> https://learnwagtail.com/tutorials/how-to-enable-the-v2-api-to-create-a-headless-cms/
[12:36:20] <serafeim> i'm using the wagtail spa to serve some pages as SPA
[12:36:27] <LordKalma> but yeah, it's like, you find things you want everywhere
[12:36:35] <LordKalma> but there's no "one tru framework" :D
[12:38:13] <LordKalma> V2 headless sounds like what I said, just with some boilerplate handled for me
[12:38:35] <LordKalma> how hard would be to add to an existing project?
[12:38:42] <LordKalma> (and fully administrate on django-admin)
[12:38:58] <serafeim> shouldn't be too hard: https://docs.wagtail.io/en/stable/advanced_topics/add_to_django_project.html
[12:39:01] <serafeim> wagtail uses its own admin
[12:39:12] <LordKalma> compatible with custom user models, I hope
[12:39:57] <LordKalma> but thanks for this, serafeim  :D
[12:40:08] <LordKalma> seems like something I'd want to do to add a "blog"-ish component to my project
[12:40:36] <LordKalma> # For anything not caught by a more specific rule above, hand over to Wagtail's serving mechanism
[12:40:40] <LordKalma> re_path(r'', include(wagtail_urls)),
[12:41:05] <LordKalma> I hope this won't be a pain to handle with nginx versus the frontend
[12:41:09] <LordKalma> choose what to route where
[12:44:44] <duoi> LordKalma any reason why using django at all for the blog?
[12:45:05] <LordKalma> I was just asking what kind of things are being done
[12:45:45] <LordKalma> https://i.gyazo.com/bb1b40a858ad850b50321023fa0bddd9.png
[12:45:51] <LordKalma> I'm buyilding this webpage
[12:45:59] <serafeim> no it won't be a pain
[12:46:05] <duoi> right. you can use DRF or normal django views. ive built modules like that in the past, wasnt hard.
[12:46:06] <serafeim> duoi: what he should use instead
[12:46:19] <LordKalma> I went for DRF because it's primarily a data-oriented website
[12:46:29] <LordKalma> that tree view is of coruse based on a model :)
[12:46:41] <LordKalma> and I was wondering about adding a general "posts"-like page to that
[12:46:47] <LordKalma> just to complete the portal

[12:47:02] <LordKalma> I'm thinking adding a rich editor to django-admin, like tiny mce or something
[12:47:07] <LordKalma> and serve that
[12:47:11] <serafeim> LordKalma: wagtail has that builtin
[12:47:20] <serafeim> i think it's worth
[12:47:36] <LordKalma> I'll make a git branch and try that then :) thanks for the suggestion
[12:47:38] <serafeim> i.e using the wagtail to serve the blog portion of your page
[12:47:55] <LordKalma> but it might be worth adding the rich text editor to regular django-admin
[12:47:58] <duoi> serafeim for a blog? in 2021 id like to see an engineering manager argue against something like stackbit.com
[12:48:09] <serafeim> don't know what's that
[12:48:27] <LordKalma> duoi, we're only talking backend here
[12:49:05] <LordKalma> that tree view in my screenshot has some fields that could use some regular prettyfication :)
[12:49:16] <LordKalma> I'm using https://quasar.dev/ for the frontend :)
[12:50:02] <LordKalma> the website is life at https://radioamadorismo.ruilvo.com/ if you want to check it out
[12:50:04] <duoi> serafeim <10 buttons essentially to set up a static site generator like Hugo, connect it to Netlify, plug in forestry and connect it to a github repo, probably 60 seconds from start to finish

[16:01:50] <ktosiek> dodo: I am using Django migrations, I want to handle additional kinds of SQL objects with those.
[16:02:41] <ktosiek> I know I can just create a RunSQL by hand. But I'd rather be able to generate definitions of objects I need (there's a bunch of them), and have some tool notice the definitions have changed.
[16:03:13] <FunkyBob> GinFuyou: RunSQL does it

[20:48:01] <Camilo> django doesn't like this. {username: "bob"} is fine but including phone with an emptry string isn't
[20:48:40] <Camilo> should I override the serializer to delete keys with empty values. Or should I rewrite the request so it doesn't send empty strings

[21:12:49] <Camilo> GinFuyou: required=false allows you to send an object that excludes the field, but throws an exception if you send the field with a null or blank value.
[21:13:52] <Camilo> I've rewritten the front end to delete keys that have blanks strings as values.
[21:15:45] <Camilo> unless I'm missing something obvious there doesn't seem an "easy" way to handle this in django other than overriding to_internal_value
[21:17:19] <GinFuyou> blank=True \ null=True on the model field?
[21:17:55] <GinFuyou> it blank should automatically propagate on modelserializers as it does on form fields

[22:45:27] <yolobolo> I'm not yet trying to access my media files
[22:45:55] <yolobolo> my files aren't being saved to where they should be
[22:46:05] <yolobolo> i.e., MEDIA_ROOT
[22:46:28] <yolobolo> instead they;re going to my project root (BASE_DIR)
[22:49:21] <teut> try using absolute path in the  upload_to
[22:49:48] <teut> to get absolute path import   settings.MEDIA_ROOT
[22:50:16] <yolobolo> could do that or instead use https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/files/#the-built-in-filesystem-storage-class
[22:50:17] <teut> from django.conf import settings
[22:50:44] <yolobolo> but that'd require me to do that for all the FileFields in my models.py
[22:50:58] <yolobolo> which would be nasty
[22:51:01] <teut> its almost an year I did django, you gotta see from here
[22:51:35] <yolobolo> ah
[22:51:55] <yolobolo> I hope it's not some bug with django itself
[22:52:07] <teut> no ,its not
[22:52:23] <teut> remember django has defaults
[22:52:36] <teut> if django cant locate your path
[22:52:46] <teut> it will save to its default
[22:53:01] <yolobolo> yea, by default it should store to MEDIA_ROOT
[22:53:09] <yolobolo> not sure what i'm doing wrong
[22:53:21] <teut> no, it will store where its coded to
[22:53:32] <teut> and for that see the implementtion
[22:54:28] <teut> upload_to = settings.MEDIA_ROOT + path
[22:54:33] <teut> whats wrong with this?
[22:55:25] <yolobolo> nothing, but I do not want to do that everywhere
[22:55:36] <yolobolo> and if this sentence from django docs is right
[22:55:37] <yolobolo> By default, Django stores files locally, using the MEDIA_ROOT and MEDIA_URL settings. The examples below assume that you’re using these defaults.
[22:55:49] <yolobolo> that would mess things up
[22:57:30] <teut> if it is working , then I dont this it would be such a big problem, otherwise declare a new variable in settings and import it which would be the path to that folder
