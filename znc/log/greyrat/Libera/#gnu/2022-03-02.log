[14:29:13] <epony> FreeBSD replaces Redhat and does more, better, sustainable and with improved quality, without dependence on proprietary middleware.
[14:29:28] <epony> FreeBSD >> Redhat.
[14:29:36] <labrador> epony, nah
[14:29:45] <labrador> Again more bullshit...redhat has done so much
[14:29:56] <epony> labrador, you're an idiot ;-)
[14:30:04] <labrador> also tesseract redhat is free as in freedom
[14:30:06] <labrador> epony, kek
[14:30:14] <isf> GNU/Linux-Libre are the only free distros available
[14:30:39] <isf> i recommend dont recommend malware aka nonfree software becouse is a injustice 
[14:30:50] <epony> Redhat is full of security holes and proprietary middleware and hooks for support and rent-seeking.
[14:30:56] <labrador> epony, nah it isn't
[14:31:03] <epony> it is
[14:31:06] <rindolf> epony: https://github.com/shlomif/what-i-learned-from-porting-to-freebsd
[14:31:08] <labrador> Licensing is fine
[14:31:27] <epony> nobody cares about that when it comes to servers
[14:31:40] <epony> business wants speed, quality, reliability
[14:31:52] <labrador> epony, well yea and redhat offers that
[14:31:57] <epony> no

[14:32:01] <labrador> Yes
[14:32:06] <labrador> Thats why they're in business

[14:35:42] <labrador> You're the one who keeps making claims without proofs
[14:36:04] <labrador> epony, you seem to be too considering you think freeBSD is popular in the industry
[14:36:31] <epony> nothing to prove to you, you're not an arbiter of operating systems, but an empty headed "advocacy" spambot
[14:36:41] <epony> it is

[14:39:46] <gnoo> systemd, dbus, elogind, ... guess who pushes for that
[14:40:08] <labrador> gnoo, again...systemd is fine,dbus also fine,logind also fine. Its all free software
[14:40:21] <gnoo> it's not good software

[14:40:29] <gnoo> being free doesn't mean good
[14:40:35] <labrador> ye
[14:40:46] <epony> Redhat was a real clownade in the 1995-2000 period and after that lost relevance on the consumer market and remains just pushover contract platform for medium business
[14:41:42] <epony> it contained serious flaws in installation media and was lagging with fixes and updates in the 90ies
[14:41:58] <epony> so most servers running Redhat were compromise ready in 2-5 minutes
[14:42:54] <labrador> epony, proof?
[14:42:59] <labrador> Or outta ur ass?
[14:43:07] <epony> it's well known commercia distributions do not care about security, but about volume / bulk, price per sear and contract support extensions
[14:43:23] <epony> labrador, are you unable to read or what?
[14:43:42] <labrador> epony, proof...not something you say
[14:43:45] <labrador> Like an article
[14:43:47] <labrador> Or something
[14:44:02] <epony> labrador, go find it yourself
[14:44:18] <epony> can you not see the CVE list?
[14:44:22] <labrador> epony, the burden of proof lies on you
[14:44:23] <labrador> Not on me
[14:44:33] <epony> there is much more missing in the 1995-1999 period
[14:44:49] <labrador> If you want to say something epony be able to substantiate it with sources
[14:44:55] <labrador> Otherwise its just rambling
[14:45:01] <labrador> That you very much like to do epony 
[14:45:04] <epony> labrador, I said it already.
[14:46:03] <epony> labrador, now you can not accept facts and contradict reality with "silly" requests, like your fingers have fallen off or something

[14:58:25] <epony> it's up to you to find the alternative ;-)

[14:59:23] <labrador> epony, its free software so no you aren't
[14:59:39] <epony> incorrect
[14:59:57] <epony> it's neither free nor open
[15:00:04] <labrador> epony, how so
[15:00:06] <labrador> exactly
[15:00:32] <epony> and you can't participate in that, it's closed off / fenced and proprietary software with a very high cost and below average quality
[15:01:07] <labrador> epony, thats false
[15:01:10] <labrador> Its free software
[15:01:13] <labrador> So ur wrong
[15:01:18] <epony> you have very few freedoms when you use their expensive software, to not use it, or to pay for support contracts and lose on remote attacks again
[15:01:31] <epony> it's not free ;-) it's unfree
[15:01:52] <epony> that's why your fellow is seeking an alternative
[15:02:00] <epony> fix your logic failures first
[15:02:01] <tesseract> labrador: why do you say rhel is free software_?
[15:02:23] <labrador> tesseract, because it is? why do you say it isn't? Most of it is under the gpl
[15:02:33] <gnoo> tesseract: free as in free speech 
[15:02:50] <tesseract> it ccomes with kernel with blob
[15:03:02] <isf> the only free distributions of GNU/Linux are: https://www.gnu.org/distros/free-distros.html
[15:03:16] <epony> check how many of the "four freedoms" you have retained when you purchase a copy of the Redhat Enterprise Linux distribution.. and what it costs for you to have any of those freedoms with Redhat produce
[15:03:20] <labrador> tesseract, I said most
[15:03:31] <labrador> epony, huh those cannot override the license
[15:03:39] <tesseract> labrador: so, it makes it nonfree
[15:03:53] <GNUHacker> people that promote GNU distros with optional non-free software when we have fully free GNU distros without non-free software https://www.gnu.org/distros/free-distros.html
[15:04:21] <labrador> tesseract, most of it is free....
[15:04:27] <labrador> Still counts in my book
[15:04:33] <labrador> Like debian has freedom
[15:04:38] <labrador> Even tho its not fully free
[15:04:48] <epony> people can also read and find information on their own and know when a proprietary software distribution costs more than they can afford
[15:05:04] <epony> that's above their pay grade making it very non-free
[15:05:10] <isf> Whether a program is free affects first of all our decisions about our private activities: to maintain our freedom, we need to reject the programs that would take it away. However, it also affects what we should say to others and do with others.
[15:05:21] <isf> A nonfree program is an injustice. To distribute a nonfree program, to recommend a nonfree program to other people, or more generally steer them into a course that leads to using nonfree software, means leading them to give up their freedom. To be sure, leading people to use nonfree software is not the same as installing nonfree software in their computers, but we should not lead people in the wrong direction.
[15:05:46] <tesseract> lol
[15:05:49] <tesseract> dude
[15:06:11] <epony> also, even with products like those coming out of Mozilla, you still have no freedoms to submit changes and participate in the development
[15:06:14] <epony> it's walled off
[15:06:20] <isf> At a deeper level, we must not present a nonfree program as a solution because that would grant it legitimacy. Nonfree software is a problem; to present it as a solution denies the existence of the problem.
[15:06:25] <epony> you can "take it" or "leave it"
[15:06:31] <labrador> epony, nah
[15:06:34] <labrador> Thats paying
[15:06:37] <labrador> Not freedom
[15:06:41] <labrador> Different stuff
[15:06:45] <isf> you can pay for free software
[15:06:54] <epony> do you think you can make changes to Redhat Enterprise Linux?
[15:06:56] <isf> free software mean software who respect your freedom
[15:07:09] <isf> if you cant sell free software the software isnt free software.
[15:07:13] <epony> the Enterprise freedoms?
[15:07:15] <labrador> epony, yeah you can
[15:07:21] <labrador> Thats why rocky linux is made
[15:07:27] <isf> all deserve freedoms
[15:07:38] <epony> Imperial freedoms or colonial freedoms?
[15:07:40] <gnoo> it might not get back to rh but you can make changes and distribute it

[15:08:20] <epony> were you using it in the past?
[15:08:29] <tesseract> because they killed it
[15:08:39] <isf> we recommend that you use a free GNU/Linux system distribution, one that does not include proprietary software at all. That way you can be sure that you are not installing any nonfree programs. Here is our list of such distros:
[15:08:39] <isf> Free GNU/Linux distributions. https://www.gnu.org/distros/free-distros.html
[15:08:43] <epony> no, it's still available and usable
[15:09:05] <isf> tesseract please, dont recommend nonfree software in the gnu channel
[15:09:34] <isf> remmeber here is the official chat of the GNU Project 
[15:09:37] <tesseract> isf: dude, don't compy paste those stuff. everyone knows what free software is in here
[15:09:41] <labrador> tesseract, yeh its real nice

[15:32:50] <epony> see, it's a fairly easy thing to say "what is FreeBSD" and why do you think it is better than Redhat Enterprise Linux
[15:36:10] <epony> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FreeBSD#Birth_of_FreeBSD
[15:36:27] <epony> Today, FreeBSD is used by many IT companies such as IBM, Nokia, Juniper Networks, and NetApp to build their products.[16][17] Certain parts of Apple's Mac OS X operating system are based on FreeBSD.[18] Both the PlayStation 3 and Nintendo Switch operating system also borrow certain components from FreeBSD,[7][8] while the PlayStation 4 operating system is derived from FreeBSD 9.[19] Netflix,[20] WhatsApp,[21] and FlightAware[22] are also examples of large, 
[15:36:27] <epony> successful and heavily network-oriented companies which are running FreeBSD.
[15:37:02] <labrador> epony, bsds don't eve come near linux's marketshare
[15:37:27] <epony> kind of wrong and stupid thing to say, isn't it?  Mar02 1103<labrador> Freebsd is nowhere epony  Mar02 1103<labrador> Its almost dead
[15:37:34] <rindolf> epony: FOss ≠ noncommercal
[15:39:03] <epony> the point is, FreeBSD beats Redhat in terms of "survival" for the individual and small to medium business at NO COST, and NO FORCED CONTACTS and NO SUPPORT mandate to keep it up, just updating and tweaking to your needs
[15:39:16] <epony> that's non-participatory freedom guaranteed
[15:39:25] <epony> a thing that Redhat can not give you
[15:40:05] <epony> that's why you're searching "alternatives", cause you want some set of software to use on servers.. and you can't pay the prohibitive prices of RHEL..
[15:40:25] <labrador> epony, prices are fine
[15:40:25] <gnoo> just use triseqeal on your servers ;)
[15:40:31] <labrador> no problemo
[15:40:35] <epony> and you can realistically participate in FreeBSD and have all the GNU utilities and tools you know there
[15:40:36] <labrador> THe point is freedom epony 
[15:40:39] <gnoo> or guix
[15:41:31] <epony> cause FreeBSD is a better host for the GNU userland and application software than proprietary and corporate Linux is
[15:41:43] <epony> and is more free and accessible and participatory and inclusive
[15:41:48] <epony> (and runs faster)
[15:42:23] <epony> that's like "a replacement" to RHEL ;-)
[15:42:37] <epony> get it, now after a while of thinking are beginning to "think"
[15:42:42] <epony> are you?
[15:43:29] <epony> the point in the question was "I need something more sustainable than the expensive and non-cooperative RHEL"
[15:44:02] <epony> you have choices, and one of them is a system with a different licensing model, but still in the same category
[15:44:34] <epony> where you get the "same" programs from GNU as well as packages
[15:44:59] <epony> in fact the entire system was using the GNU GCC bootstrap toolchains up to a couple of years ago
[15:45:52] <epony> that's the same with other BSDs, but the LLVM was pushed over by the graphics drivers (and hype / marketing and licensing) rather than efficiency and performance
[15:47:31] <epony> though, you can't deny to admit, it has a cleaner IR (intermediate representation) and optmisation / runtime separation and can quickly displace a legacy toolchain that complicates things with licensing fallout models (complex) and less helpful debugging and assistance tooling
[15:48:48] <epony> the same reasons why git is gaining popularity despite not solving anything radically different, just a bit more own goals oriented and self-hosting and newer model of the toolset
[15:49:30] <epony> if the point is freedom, why are people choosing the other licensing model for their compiler toolchain then?
[15:49:50] <isf> all BSD distros are nonfree distros 
[15:49:54] <epony> is it more free or more open or more participatory or more polished or?
[15:50:02] <epony> isf, that's wrong and blunt
[15:50:10] <isf> if that was wrong show me
[15:50:12] <isf> a free distro

[16:22:33] <epony> the important thing to know is

[16:35:02] <epony> now some puppy screams "but it's not free", which is plain stupid

[16:37:15] <epony> mostly after 2005-2010 (the 64bit epoch, did not need that much conversion after all)
[16:37:42] <epony> that's why 64bit new efforts are eating the compiler toolchain lunch
[16:38:53] <epony> (which is quite sad and unfortunate for such a critical and efficient tool, but you eat your own porridge that you did to yourself with the split licensing model of the compiler and libraries and modules, and.. the slow stagnant and conservative protective and controlling captive development of the compiler and libraries)

[16:41:00] <epony> the licensing, you know is just a way to limit propagation and projects between groups and larger coastal areas, have NOTHING to do with "shouting" and "freedom clashes" and "hyperbullious marketing advocacy and other baffoonery"

[16:58:17] <epony> so you will get the same result, as LLVM is the alternative to the GCC, such is the FreeBSD to the Redhat Enterprise, only FreeBSD predates and outpeforms the megacorporation that you bespokenly pronounced "free" as in "don't want it, need an alternative"

[20:07:42] <libredev> lol
[20:07:59] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> "lol"
[20:08:38] <isf> libredev the use of Free Software Licenses is for defend the users freedoms
[20:09:03] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> and because the insanity of current copyright law
[20:09:18] <isf> the public domain software dont respect the users freedoms for example, a binary can be called software but can come withot the source code, that mean the software can be used how you wish and that mean you cant modify or study it
[20:09:40] <isf> cant*
[20:09:46] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> there is no such thing as public domain for that matter nowadays
[20:10:09] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> according to copyrightlaw and Bern copyright Accord
[20:10:29] <isf> And a strong free software license, as GPLv3 or later defend the users freedom with a strong copyleft who defend the user freedoms on it
[20:11:38] <libredev> isf: i know the value of copyleft but those who use bsd/mit, why not use public domain instead.
[20:12:06] <isf> you can public a binary without source code in public domain libredev
[20:12:25] <isf> that mean nonfree software becouse you cant study it or modify it
[20:12:44] <isf> the issue libredev isnt the terms of a public domain, the issue is if the software respect the users freedoms
[20:14:00] <libredev> isf: i know these, i just telling other people to use public domain who don't like gpl
[20:14:32] <isf> if you recommend public domain that mean you dont care about free software movement
[20:14:43] <jxself> It is indeed very hard, if not impossible, to make something be free of copyright restrictions on a worldwide basis.
[20:14:44] <isf> or free software becouse public domain NEVER respect the users freedoms.
[20:14:59] <isf> always in terms legal ofcourse
[20:14:59] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> libredev: nowadays there isnt such thing as public domain
[20:15:02] <jxself> This is why CC0 exists so as to simulate it as close as can be.
[20:15:12] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> you are living in the 1910s
[20:15:37] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> that is exactly why copyleft is necessary sadly
[20:15:47] <jxself> It does exist but unless something's very old it's not really doable to make it free of copyright on a worldwide basis. Check, for example, those countries that don't recognize the rule of the shorter term.
[20:16:29] <jxself> Or the agreement between the US and Germany that says something from the US is copyrighted in Germany regardless of its status in the US.
[20:16:32] <jxself> And etc.
[20:18:03] <libredev> jxself: oh yeh their are problems with public domain
[20:18:13] <jxself> The first thing to recognize is someone doesn't have 1 single copyright to abandon but 1 for each country of the world.
[20:18:57] <jxself> Even if you can abandon the copyright you got from the US, that doesn't follow for the remaining countries.

[20:20:32] <libredev> jxself: what u think about 0bsd
[20:20:47] <jxself> First it has a public domain dedication, then a permissive license fallback for the countries that won't work in, and then a promise not to sue you just in even the license didn't work.
[20:21:39] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> the thing you are disregarding is
[20:21:54] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> if everybody else is playing with diferent rules
[20:21:59] <jxself> 0BSD isn't an attempt to remove it from copyright though.
[20:22:04] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> public domain is not really a thing
[20:22:14] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> because every code built on top of you
[20:22:27] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> will default back to nasty copyright eviroment
[20:22:29] <jxself> On a worldwide basis? Probably not. But within the context of certain places? Yes.
[20:22:38] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> so sadly CC0 is totally pointless
[20:22:41] <jxself> Unless that something is very old. That's still doable.
[20:23:01] <jxself> But it would need to be so old as to probably predate computers. :)
[20:23:11] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> has said many times,that is exactly why you need copylleft 
[20:23:24] <jxself> Yes, strong copyleft FTW.
[20:23:32] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> is basically a hack to all derivative works still act on the same oldpublic domain framework ;)
[20:24:43] <libredev> one question: is gpl impose restriction to include copyright like mit/bsd

[20:28:53] <jxself> If you'll read the GPL it does require preservation of copyright notices.
[20:29:26] <jxself> The copyright holder could give you an exception. So if the person that told you that is the person in the copyright notice you're fine. If it's some random other person please ignore them.

[20:32:30] <libredev> don't get me wrong, i am just asking for education
[20:32:48] <jxself> The GPL is a license from the copyright holder. A permission, of sorts. The copyright holder is like the root user: They can do whatever they want, including giving different people differnt permissions. Even mulitple different and incompatible permissions at the same time.

[20:34:21] <jxself> So if they want to say "you don't have to follow that one particular piece of the GPL that says you need to keep intact all notices" that's would work. They're the only person that could say that though.
[20:34:41] <jxself> And they could even have that permssion be specific to you, and no one else.
[20:35:15] <libredev> jxself: ok but what about default plain gpl.
