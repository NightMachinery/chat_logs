[17:21:23] <Joanna> Hi everyone has anyone seen those videos of people collapsing on live tv?
[17:34:59] <Joanna> Has anyone seen this https://gemmaodoherty.com/german-vaccine-propagandist-collapses-on-live-tv-32/
[17:39:47] <Joanna> I wonder what that is all about she seems a bit young to be having a stroke
[17:53:37] <Joanna> I’m surprised that tv still happens live without a delay

[19:28:57] <Joanna> tangy: they have been worrying about Russia for as long as I can remember:)
[19:31:59] <Joanna> When you see things in media it’s a good idea to think about why they are trying to scare or anger you. There are all sorts of important things that will never be mentioned in news media.
[19:33:54] <Joanna> I don’t understand why Russia doesn’t just reclaim the Ukraine already. It’s possible that their government are puppets controlled by same people as the western governments..
[19:34:13] <tangy> yeah, but this rather conspicuous example isn't a 'sending of unconscious "black people are scary" messages' sort of frightening news reports. 
[19:34:24] <SANCLA> Fuck off Joanna
[19:34:30] <SANCLA> Sorry for the language op
[19:34:37] <tangy> wtf?

[19:36:04] <tangy> ew
[19:39:17] <tangy> how about, Ukraine is a soveriegn nation with 43M people, 77% of whom are ethnic Ukrainian?

[19:52:16] <tangy> I studied theatre, which is the art of convincing people that fiction is true, so "let's ignore evidence and cook up a fake narrative that benefits us and hurts them" usually seems quite obvious to me. :-\  just sayin
