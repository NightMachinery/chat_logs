[00:45:51] <buttsbot> The 4-Day Week Is Flawed. Workers Still Want It | WIRED
[00:45:54] <manicennui> What a terrible article.
[00:46:10] <manicennui> I can only imagine that this was written by people who are opposed to shorter work weeks.
[00:46:48] <manicennui> The article admits that 4 days means different things to different companies, but the examples they give sound like they were already dysfunctional.
[00:46:59] <manicennui> Somehow only working 4 days didn't fix their problems!
[00:49:30] <manicennui> "he company changed its schedule to four 10-hour days to fight burnout, boost morning focus time, and increase overlap time among its global workforces. Harkrader had been putting in 50-hour weeks. Management didn’t intend to sacrifice productivity, so Harkrader compressed his workload so he could take Fridays off without logging 12-plus-hour days."
[00:49:39] <manicennui> s/he company/The company/
[00:52:11] <gerikson> wtf
[00:52:26] <gerikson> you'd expect 4 day week to mean 4x8
[00:52:31] <gerikson> not fucking 4x10
[01:03:11] <gwozniak> I worked 4x10 at IBM.  I did not really consider it a 4 day work week
[01:03:17] <gwozniak> Those are long days
[01:03:30] <gwozniak> I only did it because my commute was so long
[01:03:59] <manicennui> gerikson: It also sounds like they were already overworked, and they just made them do the same work in less time.
[01:04:17] <manicennui> All so they could do a PR piece for shitty companies on why 4 day work weeks are bad.
[01:06:19] <manicennui> My current situation is pretty good because no one is working especially hard and no one expects more than 40 hours.
[01:06:27] <manicennui> But a new manager with a stick up their ass could ruin it.
[01:19:26] <gwozniak> This snowstorm wasn't much of a snowstorm at all here

[02:00:45] <manicennui> Yeah, we got several inches, but it wasn't quite as bad as I expected.
[02:00:52] <manicennui> But I don't know whether it is over yet.
[02:01:45] <manicennui> Looks like the change of precipitation is low for the next week.
[02:01:48] <manicennui> So maybe it is over.
[02:02:52] * manicennui laughs at the absurdity of how difficult it is to setup the frontend for the product he works on.
[02:34:46] <manicennui> I'm amazed at how bad this is.
[02:37:52] <gwozniak> I am having similar feelings to how we added code to binutils
[02:38:29] <gwozniak> it #include "whatever.c" all over the place and the build doesn't know about it, so when you edit a file it won't detect it
[02:38:51] <gwozniak> Currently trying to fix that
[03:18:32] <kline> guess who spent 15 mins trying to debug pam only to realise that sshd_config had `UsePAM no`
[03:18:49] <manicennui> Only 15 minutes?
[03:19:09] <kline> manicennui, im not a very smart person so i was running out of ideas
[03:19:26] <kline> im sure if i knew more about pam i could have spent the whole night chasing ever more outlandish corner cases
[03:19:38] <manicennui> The good thing about dumb mistakes is that everything typically makes sense once you find them.
[03:19:52] <manicennui> Much more frustrating if you don't understand why something starts working.
[03:20:39] <manicennui> I just spent a couple of hours trying to get this huge docker compose working for our frontend.
[03:21:03] <manicennui> I now have no fucking idea what the Docker people are doing.
[03:22:18] <manicennui> They have an apt repo for docker engine, but don't include other crap like docker compose and the docker compose plugin.
[03:22:33] <manicennui> At least their documentation is decent, but I'm not a huge fan of unmanaged dependencies.
[03:23:03] <manicennui> Run this command to download the current stable release of Docker Compose:
[03:23:14] <manicennui> sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.29.2/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
[03:23:14] <buttsbot> Page not found · GitHub · GitHub
[03:23:16] <manicennui> LOL?
[03:23:38] <manicennui> Then you have to change its permissions and keep it manually up to date.
[03:23:39] <manicennui> Fun.
[03:24:14] <manicennui> It's no wonder people just install Docker Desktop on Windows/Mac.

[05:07:19] <gwozniak> What is the reason for the huge drop in Facebook?
[05:07:27] <kline> gwozniak, they lost a very small number of users
[05:07:38] <kline> but notably, its the first quarter they have _ever_ lost users
[05:08:03] <kline> 1.930 last quarter, 1.929 this quarter
[05:08:10] <kline> (billion DAU)
[05:08:11] <companion_cube> they also missed their growth targets, didn't they?
[05:08:28] <kline> companion_cube, if you're shrinking you're probably not growing :^)
[05:08:34] <companion_cube> :p
[05:08:57] <companion_cube> I mean, my hair mass is shrinking
[05:09:00] <companion_cube> my belly mass, not
[05:09:03] <kline> but yes, they probably missed a bunch of financial/ad targets, but the change in sign for dau is what has people scared
[05:09:25] <kline> 200bn lost in a day because of 1 million users
[05:09:30] <companion_cube> tbh when you have almost 2 *billions* user, going downhill is easier than uphill
[05:09:38] <kline> yeah
[05:09:49] <gwozniak> companion_cube: it's how energy transfers as you get older
[05:09:52] <kline> no matter what, it was always inevitable, you cant grow forever
[05:09:56] <companion_cube> but shareholders want more growth
[05:10:02] <companion_cube> even at 7B users they would want growth
[05:10:03] <gwozniak> moar. growth.
[05:10:16] <companion_cube> "just fuck more so we get fresh new users!"
[05:10:21] <gwozniak> That's what the metaverse is for: scads of fake accounts
[05:10:54] <kline> so yeah, the western youth intake has been slowing as people move to other platforms
[05:10:59] <gwozniak> honestly, the growth mentality makes no sense to me
[05:11:06] <kline> for a while its been papered over by increased internet access in the developing world
[05:11:42] <companion_cube> gwozniak: as the joke goes, the only thing that grows indefinitely is cancer
[05:11:49] <kline> but i guess theyre running out of new people in africa to onboard and the tap is just about closed for new users in the west as people get increasingly unhappy about practices and look to tiktok etc
[05:12:01] <companion_cube> kline: and forceful stuff with internet.com or whatever bullshit they were pulling
[05:12:29] <companion_cube> internet.org? whatever "internet is actually just FB" BS deal they provided
[05:13:53] <kline> yeah
[05:14:22] <kline> think about how closed the intake must be in the west if all their efforts in africa and india are still not able to cover it off
[05:15:44] <manicennui> Can we bring MySpace back?

[05:16:47] <Church> Tumblr gotta better because they can't make it worse heh
[05:17:03] <Church> Why use The Algorithmn when you can't market to those fucks now
[05:34:20] <kline> manicennui, its funny, i went back onto my friends old tumblr for olds times sake and its still full of porn
[05:34:38] <kline> i had to check if it was still the case (it is), i just guess they only police it on an as-reported basis
[06:07:32] <imode> good porn?
[06:07:38] <imode> maybe they only culled good porn.

[07:38:06] <manicennui> Lot of mechanics shitting on Teslas in the comments
[07:39:00] <manicennui> Worked at a Tesla-certified collision shop. Only thing worse than the cars was their parts department - slow, inept, and careless. Completely at odds with any notion of environmental sustainability.
[07:39:23] <manicennui> Had an old friend who did autobody + specialized in Teslas. He literally had to take pictures and have clients acknowledge with a walk around + paperwork that the body panels were different colours from factory and that the autobody shop was not at fault prior to fixing the car.

[17:06:51] <gwozniak> Along those lines, the book I'm reading has Alan Turing being a huge fan of Snow White
[17:07:12] <riv> that's true I think
[17:07:16] <riv> irl
[17:07:40] <gwozniak> He dies by eating a poison apple in the book
[17:12:10] <gerikson> I think he ddi in real life too ?
[17:14:07] <gwozniak> But was is planted there by a member of the secret army of the Catholic Church who had just had sex with him?
[17:14:08] <riv> yes
[17:14:12] <riv> ok
[17:14:14] <riv> that part is new
[17:14:58] <gwozniak> After he fantasized a bit about the woman who basically forced him to have sex with her who is now pregnant with his child?
[17:15:43] <riv> normal people are fucking weird bro
[17:15:51] <riv> coming up with this fanfiction
[17:16:06] <riv> hasn't turing suffered enough
[17:16:32] <gwozniak> In the bio for the author (who is a retired doctor), it says he has "written a lot"
[17:16:51] <riv> itstimetostop.gif
[17:17:26] <gerikson> fapfiction
[17:17:45] <gwozniak> I should note that Turing is totally a side character in this book
[17:18:01] <gwozniak> He exists to decode the Mayan codex and that's about it
[17:19:22] <gwozniak> Although I don't know where the "son of Turing" is going to end up
[17:20:42] <gerikson> obviosuly he will be the Kwisatz Haderach
[17:23:53] <gwozniak> The thing that is the most obnoxious about the book is the omniscent narrator who is always saying something like, "They didn't know how important that will be" at the end of nearly every chapter
[17:24:06] <Geekingfrog> :D
[17:24:35] <riv> lmao
[17:25:09] <gwozniak> At about 20 chapters in I checked and I think 15 of 20 ended like that
[17:27:04] <gerikson> omg
[17:27:04] <gwozniak> Here's the end of the synopsis on the back of the book: "Will the world end?  The Potter knows the answer.  Noah, Kate discover it.  We learn it too--on the last page."
[17:28:49] <gerikson> I have a book by Alistair Reynolds I should start on
[17:29:02] <gerikson> but I should finish this ancient cyberpunk novel too
[17:29:12] <gerikson> Hardwired by Walter Jon Williams
[17:29:15] <gwozniak> I flipped to the end of a random chapter I've already read.  Here's how it ends: "Alan Turing would indeed, changing the path of both their lives--one short, one long--that neither could foresee."
[17:29:26] <gerikson> now, he seems like a nice dude but I've not finished aby book he's written
[17:29:40] <gerikson> and this one is kinda derivative

[20:34:12] <manicennui> You are just sadists.
[20:45:48] <indigo> ???
[20:46:07] <indigo> I like Docker because it provides a simpler interface to some programs I want to run
[20:47:06] <indigo> And I don't have to deal with "this program requires py3.7, but this one is only compatible with py3.4... now which python does my distro ship"
[21:07:33] <jlindgren> also great for getting specific versions if you want to test for backward compatibility. at a past employer we had different images for each java version and would run tests on everything going back to our minimum.

[21:27:41] <manicennui> drakonis: My quotes?
[21:27:56] <drakonis> yes
[21:28:04] <manicennui> drakonis: What quote?
[21:28:22] <drakonis> "I finally figured out why you all love docker. You want to make development in frameworks like rails suck as much as whatever you are using."
[21:28:27] <manicennui> drakonis: -- me
[21:28:52] <manicennui> indigo: I don't really have those problems with Ruby, and having everything in the container makes all forms of interactive development far more difficult.
[21:29:47] <manicennui> And some things basically impossible.
[21:31:00] <prussian> i just throw tigervnc and emacs on such containers. lol
[21:31:05] <prussian> yes...
[21:32:03] <prussian> no, tramp just doesn't work for me and i'm too lazy to learn why
[21:32:49] <prussian> drakonis: this looks p cool.
[21:32:54] <prussian> idk how useful it is though.
[21:32:56] <drakonis> it sure does.
[21:33:05] <prussian> i'll give it a shot
[21:33:06] <prussian> idk
[21:33:10] <prussian> i'm not really working anyhow
[21:33:16] <drakonis> i'm more partial to guile and guix though
[21:33:23] <prussian> all I'm doing is REWRITING EVERYTHING IN RUST and not doing what I'm supposed to.
[21:33:38] <gwozniak> prussian: tramp has always *almost* worked for me
[21:33:56] <prussian> so i'm not the only one.
[21:34:01] <indigo> manicennui: Development inside containers does suck
[21:34:11] <gwozniak> But there's usually one thing it fails at that I need
[21:34:13] <indigo> I've had to deal with a huge docker-compose stack
[21:34:16] <prussian> ok, almost is a closer approximation for me as well
[21:34:22] <drakonis> it is neat though
[21:34:33] <prussian> i'm just annoyed that emacs doesn't like zle or my prompt.
[21:34:36] <drakonis> because it is a level lower than scheme in the grand scheme of language composition
[21:34:42] <drakonis> kernel, that is.
[21:34:45] <Xe> god cannot stop me
[21:34:45] <manicennui> indigo: That is what someone here did.
[21:34:51] <Xe> i am using reflection to parse CSV
[21:34:56] <manicennui> indigo: And it only works in very specific cases.
[21:35:09] <manicennui> indigo: But it makes rails development way more difficult
[21:35:34] <manicennui> I get not wanting to deal with environment setup
[21:35:37] <manicennui> And that shit is annoying
[21:35:44] <manicennui> But this is trading one set of problems for another
[21:36:08] <manicennui> What is the workflow even like for compiled languages?
[21:36:25] <drakonis> http://web.cs.wpi.edu/~jshutt/kernel.html
[21:36:32] <drakonis> this is v. amaznig.
[21:36:57] <drakonis> highly impressive.
[21:39:37] <gwozniak> manicennui: we don't use it because it doesn't really help us.  We only use docker to run our simulator, which I have constant DNS problems with
[21:39:51] <gwozniak> So I actually use it without docker
[21:40:43] <gwozniak> If we move to Jenkins we'll need it for building, but that is not so bad
[21:41:13] <prussian> I keep a docker-compose more as a description of "the standard(tm)" build environment for crap at work
[21:41:28] <prussian> it even sets up CLion for VNC use in the container for those who can't even.
[21:41:36] <prussian> so convenient.
[21:41:42] <prussian> i, guess?
[21:44:56] <indigo> manicennui: If you think docker-compose is bad, try a local environment with minikube
[21:45:09] <indigo> It will turn your macbook pro into a molten blob
[21:45:24] <manicennui> heh
[21:45:39] <drakonis> lol guile used to have fexprs
[21:45:57] <manicennui> The crazy thing is, our huge monolith runs perfectly using either vagrant, or an image we built for AWS.
[21:46:08] <manicennui> I can have a new copy of it running in a couple of minutes without problems.
[21:46:19] <manicennui> It has worked well for the entire 7 years I have been here.
[21:46:23] <manicennui> The frontend is always the problem.
[21:47:53] <manicennui> And they keep making it more and more complicated.
[21:48:12] <manicennui> And it is more and more difficult to get working.
[21:48:41] <manicennui> Anyone who has to touch the frontend, or use it to test something, is spending hours every week just to set it up and keep it running
[21:54:36] <manicennui> I decreased coverage by 0.04%. Now I must add a useless test to make the gods happy.
[21:58:45] <gwozniak> I think test coverage is important, but I hate having a target percentage mandate

[22:36:34] <gwozniak> Reading assembly in this font is actually kind of cool
[22:39:30] <gwozniak> Might be a tad too thin for regular use, but we'll see
[22:40:26] <gerikson> there's a typeface called CMU typewrite that's bascally monospace Computer Modern
[22:41:00] <gerikson> "CMU Typewriter Text"
[22:41:11] <gwozniak> I gotta admit that I love seeing assembly in this font
[22:41:17] <gerikson> but I think I prefer this one
[22:42:20] <gerikson> isn't the canonical assembly font the one you got when with DOS
[22:43:04] <gwozniak> Maybe, but this totally looks like the assembly printouts in old computer papers and reports

[23:02:57] <companion_cube> you wish, but there's no fucking way
[23:03:07] <manicennui> I know...
[23:03:14] <manicennui> SSR is actually becoming more popular.
[23:03:21] <manicennui> I read recently that Amazon does SSR.
[23:03:45] <manicennui> And React SSR is becoming more popular.
[23:04:01] <manicennui> So there is some sanity out there.
[23:04:17] <companion_cube> but it's SSR + rehydration or whatever
[23:04:24] <companion_cube> so you still have react
[23:04:32] <manicennui> I don't think Amazon even does that.
