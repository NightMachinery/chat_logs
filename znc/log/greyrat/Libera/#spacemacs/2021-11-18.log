[01:55:42] <FromGitter> <drewverlee> I want to set my auto-completion to clojure-lsp. Diagnosing the issue here is my `completion-at-point-functions`  ‚èé  ‚èé completion-at-point-functions is a variable defined in ‚Äòminibuffer.el‚Äô. ‚èé Its value is (tags-completion-at-point-function) ‚èé  ... [https://gitter.im/syl20bnr/spacemacs?at=61958166b71b5010a7fdb73d]
[01:56:53] <FromGitter> <drewverlee> likely i want to do this follow these instructions to add an auto completion layer https://develop.spacemacs.org/layers/+completion/auto-completion/README.html#add-auto-completion-in-a-layer
[01:57:25] <FromGitter> <drewverlee> i'm guessing this should be a change in the clojure layer...
[03:43:02] <FromGitter> <drewverlee> In my emacs LSP completion group vars, the lsp-completion provider value is t. ‚èé  ‚èé as where the official clojure-lsp docs,  suggest the default is capf. I'm guessing that's related to the problem of me not getting completion.
[04:15:54] <FromGitter> <ozzloy:matrix.org> when i start up spacemacs, i get a tummy ache and feel like a side of fries.  anyone else seeing this behavior?  a recent commit maybe?

[19:44:14] <FromGitter> <iftheshoefritz> Trying to use `.dir-locals.el` to deal with the "watching all the files ... so watching the repo may slow emacs down" error I get from lsp-mode. Does spacemacs work with `.dir-locals.el`?

[19:47:46] <FromGitter> <iftheshoefritz> never figured it out. I just know that if I close the buffer and come back the orange is gone
[19:47:59] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> @iftheshoefritz Spacemacs definitely works with .dir-locals.el (it is just Emacs). Or maybe you mean for solbing this particual problem?
[19:48:53] <FromGitter> <iftheshoefritz> @dalanicolai well first I had to establish that spacemacs respects .dir-locals. Now that you've confirmed that it does I can dig deeper... anything obviously wrong with that snippet?
[19:50:07] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> On first sight it looks fine to me
[19:50:49] <FromGitter> <iftheshoefritz> I have to admit I have no idea what is going on with all that escaping
[19:50:51] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> Of course you can check the value of the variable after lsp-mode was started in that directory (although you porbably did that already)
[19:51:03] <FromGitter> <iftheshoefritz> ah... how do I do that?
[19:51:13] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> > I have to admit I have no idea what is going on with all that escaping ‚èé  ‚èé I'm no expert too
[19:51:29] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> > ah... how do I do that? ‚èé  ‚èé Just `SPC h d v`
[19:51:45] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> or via `M-:` and typing the name of the variable
[19:55:44] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> I also read here (https://emacs-lsp.github.io/lsp-mode/page/file-watchers/) that you can check the watched folders in `*lsp-log*`

[20:08:59] <FromGitter> <iftheshoefritz> Hmmm, if I `eval-region` the content of the variable does update, but it doesn't have the effect I expect. OTOH if I close emacs and reopen it then open a file in the project, the variable has the old value (i.e. .dir-locals is ignored)
[20:09:28] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> I do see that you are missing a closing parenthesis in the snippet you posted

[20:18:19] <FromGitter> <iftheshoefritz> Seems that setting everything explicitly in my .spacemacs user-config does what I expect, but it'll be better if your suggestion for dir-locals works. I'll try that next
[20:27:04] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> Ah good... I would say dir-locals should work also then
[20:32:57] <FromGitter> <iftheshoefritz> hmm, adding the missing bracket did nothing, which is consistent with what I *think* I'm getting from the lsp-mode issue tracker
[20:34:17] <FromGitter> <iftheshoefritz> seems like the only way is to set everything globally in .spacemacs. Fortunately there is a set of values that I think will satisfy all my projects

[22:31:01] <FromGitter> <ivar> q: I'm fond of the filesystem manipulation functionality in neotree (i.e. add, rename files) but also the project management in treemacs. Ideally I'd be able to add/rename/etc files in treemacs but AFAICT it's just for browsing. I can't find an option that meets both needs - does anyone have a recommendation or thoughts on file browsing ?
[22:45:01] <FromGitter> <drewverlee> is tab completion enabled by default on the latest dev branch? if i manually run `completion-at-point` i get the expected results, but if `tab` at that same point nothing happens.
