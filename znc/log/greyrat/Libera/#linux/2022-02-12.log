[01:11:08] <jim> I'm guessing that / is not mounted read/write because there isn't a script that does that, now for a lot of this thing, I'm guessing, if it boots and runs a shell, it stays the way it's mounted, because there's nothing in place yet to do otherwise
[01:11:10] <Guest1778> Hello, I am using bash and want to install Powerline ( https://powerline.readthedocs.io/en/latest/overview.html ) I would like help for this step: https://powerline.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/linux.html#fonts-installation
[01:11:10] <Guest1778> On step 2 the instructions say to move the PowerlinesSymbols.otf file to a specific directory. When I do that with their listed command the prompt tells me the directory does not exist: "mv: cannot move ‚ÄòPowerlineSymbols.otf‚Äô to ‚Äò/users7/other/myusername/.local/share/fonts/‚Äô: No such file or directory"
[01:11:11] <Guest1778> Why does this not exist? If it matters, I am using Anaconda

[01:14:10] <malvo> jim: there is a kernel command-line parameter called "rw". according to the kernel docs at https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v4.14/admin-guide/kernel-parameters.html, it does the following: "Mount root device read-write on boot". that's exactly what is not happening.

[02:26:33] <mrfb> when you connect, what you see is the prompt of the remote machine

[02:27:13] <mrfb> brain farts, it doesnt matter windows or linux, when he ssh, the prompt he sees is from the remote machine
[02:27:28] <Guest1778> I considered the instructions for the linux terminal because the remote machine is using centos
[02:27:53] <mrfb> Guest1778: install all the powerline on the other machine
[02:27:57] <uwharrie> the remote machine produces the prompt, but if the local terminal doesn't have the correct colors, fonts, or escape code support, it's not going to look like much
[02:28:04] <eof> mrfb: i believe that has been done
[02:28:14] <eof> uwharrie: that's more likely the case

[02:29:00] <Guest1778> Windows 10
[02:29:49] <jim> ok, and you're using a terminal from windows 10 to ssh... to a centos machine that's on a campus?
[02:30:02] <Guest1778> That's correct.
[02:30:06] <uwharrie> you can go through the Linux install procedure, but the color/font/etc support is only going to apply to a terminal running on that linux system. `ssh -X xterm` or similar might work

[04:10:44] <jim> I'll check that out... was it originally implemented in windows?
[04:10:49] <Psi-Jack> No.
[04:10:57] <Psi-Jack> It was literally implemented for vim, in Linux.

[04:11:32] <Psi-Jack> It was later expanded to work with bash, zsh, fish, tmux, IPython, Awesome, i3 and Qtile, apparently.

[04:12:08] <Psi-Jack> powerline is basically like "power status bar line"
[04:12:20] <jim> so the OP's original thing, was first off, it worked for him, running windows

[04:13:56] <jim> the second (where the problem was), was where he tried to ssh to a centos machine, apparantly with a powerline running on it... but I don't know anything about it, not enough to reason through how to find the problem
[04:14:12] <AeroNotix> it didn't seem like powerline was set up on that machine
[04:14:27] <AeroNotix> I think they expected because it was working locally, it would carry over when ssh'ing
[04:14:33] <jim> you mean on the remote?

[04:15:36] <jim> so, the thing would have to be installed on the centos machine

[04:17:37] <jim> that should be it then... if he shows up again, someone is likely able to help
[04:18:20] <loganlee[gnu]> hi guys
[04:18:23] <Psi-Jack> I don;t use nor recommend it, but I use ideas from it, including I used to use vim-airline, until I just switched to spacevim.
[04:18:25] <Mister_Magister> Guys, i bought (used) amd rx560, yeeted my gtx1060, installed the amd, yeeted the nvidia drivers and everything is fine as in desktop, videos, 2d stuff. But when i try anything 3d i get artifacts and eventually the gpu crashes. I got dmesg
[04:18:25] <jim> hi
[04:18:29] <loganlee[gnu]> hi jim
[04:18:44] <AeroNotix> Mister_Magister: think you already have your answer
[04:18:54] <Mister_Magister> AeroNotix: if i did, i wouldn't ask
[04:19:10] <AeroNotix> Mister_Magister: used gpus (especially right now) are incredibly risky
[04:19:14] <jim> what was the answer? :)
[04:19:17] <AeroNotix> pass the dmesg though by all means
[04:19:42] <Mister_Magister> AeroNotix: i think it's more likely to be software problem rather than hardware

[05:10:23] <blahboybaz> AeroNotix: That's part of where the question originates from. The example I gave comes from a lesson I am learing about regex (in freeCodeCamp). However, the example they are giving does not seem to jive with what the documentation describes. Since I am new to this (just now learning it - hence the fact that I am taking a lesson on it in freeCodeCamp) I want to be sure that I am interpreting the
[05:10:29] <blahboybaz> documentation correctly. You see, I do not take it lightly to think that a lesson on the matter would have a typo in it. I would sooner think that I am misunderstanding.

[05:20:11] *** Joins: Two_Dogs (~emanuel@user/two-dogs/x-6929303)
[05:20:42] <blahboybaz> If what is being said in the example regex is to apply "?" to the "*" preceeding it then that makes no sense to me because it's an overlap in logic (ie: both * and ? will match zero characters - so in that part they can do the same thing). If that's what's going on then there seems to be no need for * in that example
[05:20:51] <kurahaupo> blahboybaz: that depends which dialect of regex you're talking about. Some dialects have 0-or-1 written as {0,1} rather than ? and/or may require \ before the modifier

[07:30:26] <AeroNotix> yeah only system calls
[07:30:34] <AeroNotix> but dbus uses sendmsg/recvmsg any way
[07:30:46] <AeroNotix> and you can see the dbus API being invoked, along with the iov_base (a string)

[07:33:39] <GaM3r2Xtreme> I can see that. 'RVGL registers the custom URI discord-472158403830218762:// for Discord Rich Presence integration.' is what's stated in the documentation.

[07:40:36] <znf> could have a look to see if ./rvgl -help shows anything, maybe it can unregister
[07:40:46] <AeroNotix> what I meant by that is that no amount of debugging (wihtout source code, to boot) will get us closer to a fix

[08:28:43] <jim> random1, btrfs started coming out after LVM did, and what it did was enough. I guess btrfs is getting stable, I'm hearing less and less horror stories about it
[08:28:57] <ayecee> znf: a volume on btrfs, as used by a virtual machine, would just be a file, no?
[08:29:12] <ayecee> it's not like subvolumes which are more like subdirectories
[08:29:13] <znf> I don't know
[08:29:39] <znf> I've never used btrfs for vm storage, only zfs
[08:29:46] <ayecee> if so, then a sparse file would act like a thin volume
[08:30:00] <znf> And their zvols aren't dirs
[08:30:15] <ayecee> oh, zvols, that's the one i was looking for.
[08:30:17] <GaM3r2Xtreme> so sadly unsetting the environment variable doesn't seem to help. a good check none-the-less.
[08:30:30] <znf> Yeah but then it's not a btrfs feature, just qcow2's sparse ability
[08:30:45] <jim> random1, so it's less an issue of preference with me, and more about stability of the filesystem... and lvm has been rock solid vor a vary long time
[08:30:45] <ayecee> GaM3r2Xtreme: still get the dbus error?
[08:31:07] <ayecee> GaM3r2Xtreme: i guess it either detects dbus another way, or launches its own dbus session.

[13:59:30] <pulsar12> i see that access timestamp of files in linux are changing like everyday (such as passwd or ping, or ls). the filesystem is mounted with relatime. i would like to understand why they get updated if on atime if there is no write. if i just manually 'cat' the files, the ts is not updated as expected... because of relatime. so i dont know what is modifying it

[14:08:22] <MrElendig> and only because the mta breaks without atime :p
[14:08:28] <mlu> unless you have very explicit requirements that make the usefulness of atime mandatory, it's almost certainly useless and antiproductive

[14:08:48] <mlu> the problem with atime is that you have to write back to the filesystem to perform a read-only operation

[14:55:48] <MrElendig> how broken the playback will be depends on which parts is missing
[14:55:59] <rascul> if the end is missing you might not be able to play it at all
[14:56:04] <MrElendig> if its 10mb at the actual end of the file then you can basically play it fine
[14:56:09] <cheater> the end is usually not missing
[14:56:14] <MrElendig> if you are missing random bframes.....
[14:56:27] <cheater> torrent clients have a feature where they'll prefer to download first and last parts
[14:56:29] <rascul> some fcormats store necessary info at the end

Then doing that *again* when you decided running a secondary MX was a good idea, and started spamming people with bounces

[18:22:32] <hexnewbie> I'm not sure about that, the hobby mail server will still need a lot of the knowledge and care the business mail server would. Besides, you'd get no warning that your personal emails are not being delivered for weeks on end, unlike the business case.

[18:58:14] <CuriosTiger> Yeah, because there's 25 different DNS records that have been created by various attempts to fight spam, because there's ten times that many spamblock lists that preemptively blacklist much of the world's IP space, and because there are things you can't even fight -- like heuristics that presume you're a spammer if you don't send a large volume of legitimate mail.

[20:27:40] <znf> also, "bash" itself is not the fastest thing out there, dash is somewhat faster, but then you're "stuck" on POSIX shell

[20:49:25] <phogg> rascul: nobody likes it, but since it's there nobody is willing to throw it out and replace it with something essentially identical in terms of features, but less dumb.

[20:49:46] <rascul> There are 5 6 NINE (or 63*, depending how you count) different ways to write multi-line strings in YAML.
[20:49:58] <phogg> you don't have to tell me, I have used YAML since it was invented
[20:50:06] <catbeard> phogg: Syck
[20:50:11] <frost-core> phogg : i have realized that antix does not use systemd
[20:50:12] <phogg> it's a nice alternative to XML from the days when XML was *everything*
[20:50:12] <catbeard> :)
[20:50:15] <frost-core> thats the issue
[20:50:31] <rascul> xml is rare enough nowadays that i would prefer it over yaml
[20:50:39] <rascul> and it makes me sad that i feel that way

[22:14:24] <jim> padawan_, you should look into it
[22:14:38] <padawan_> but the problem is that the games i want to finish are in uplay
[22:14:38] <rascul> johnjaye to clarify, that's what the openssh client prints out when the host key for a remote host is different that what it finds in ~/.ssh/known_hosts
[22:14:49] <rascul> other clients may not
[22:15:07] <Dagmar> Either way when a host key changes, it's time to actually pay attention

[22:26:34] <phogg> Gustavo6046: characterizing dpkg as buggy is simply a fallacy.You may like pacman better because it runs faster, but it's not as safe in any measure, and it is not as bug free. I will take slower if it means more robust, and apt+dpkg is that.
[22:26:39] <Dagmar> Oh and unlike a whole bunch of otehr similar things, the lead for iRedMail doesn't tell people "Just disable selinux"
[22:26:47] <__ad> aaaah beer time   https://snipboard.io/w8IC02.jpg
[22:26:55] <johnjaye> disabling selinux used to solve a lot of problems
[22:26:57] <Gustavo6046> simply better does exist, it's just uncommon and usually when people talk about 'simply better' they're being baseless elitists; for most things, 'simply better' would be almost impossible, because of the amount of departments that would have to be met each in an exceptional manner in order to do so.

[22:31:07] <phogg> johnjaye: depends on how much you want to be forced to learn up front
[22:31:08] <Gustavo6046> Anyway, another point I'd like to make is that the touted "newbie-friendliness" about Ubuntu is really an exaggeration; newer users will want to learn more about the Linux ecosystem and it's good that they do, but a lot of the times can be punished by bad and irreversible changes, like accidentally rm'ing important library files. Distributions like Fedora Kinoite, Garuda Arch Linux and SteamOS 3 allow rollbacks. There are other reasons why
[22:31:08] <Gustavo6046> they're more friendly to newcomers, but another strong point is that, with the exception of SteamOS 3, they are sufficiently general purpose and strong that they're still good choices even if you're more seasoned in using a Linux distribution.
[22:31:14] <Dagmar> I'm not sure you're really paying attention, man.  That bodes ill for what's going to happen when you stand up a mail server.
[22:31:30] <Dagmar> iRedMail _sets up_ postfix and dovecot (and a handful of other necessary support mechanisms) for you
[22:31:43] <Dagmar> It's not a mail daemon in and of itself

If i curl through a proxy, i tried fiddler and mitmproxy, it works! im not blocked with the captch thing, which is actually cloudflare checking thing. Now if i copy the curl request from the proxy, it is basically the same command im doing anyway, and do it without the proxy i get blocked! What kind of magic is this that cloudflare is doing?
[23:55:29] <Spiker01> Hello. I have now installed KDE Plasma on Arch GNU/Linux. But I also use i3wm. There was a following problem: Now instead of the Gnome/Gtk theme, i3wm uses icon themes, window styles and cursor skins from kde plasma. I didn't manually add anything to i3wm autoload or GNU/Linux autoload. How do I get i3wm to use GTK skins instead of kde skins again? Previously, before installing KDE, i3wm used a GTK theme. The system has Gnome installed.
[23:56:01] <Dagmar> mattf: Not sure but I still think ther'es probably something obscure in the query headers that you're either missing or not realizing is important

[23:56:48] <mattf> Dagmar: but the same command from another machine on the same lan works. from remote machines with different ip also works. Exact same curl command
[23:56:55] <mattf> there is something way more obscure

[23:57:06] <Dagmar> Understand that Cloudflare has _plenty_ of reasons to "go the extra mile" in weeding out non-standard or even "slightly unusual" access of the webservers it's protecting
[23:57:10] <personx_> okay, this sounds good. :D Any suggestions on whether to pick digitalocean or vultr [or someone else?] 'cause i've been reading that digitalocean blocks smtp traffic?
[23:57:30] <Dagmar> personx_: yeah you're going to want to talk to your hoster about that no matter what

[23:57:45] <Dagmar> LOTS of places block SMTP by default just because not everyone's trying to run a mail server
[23:58:12] <Dagmar> Many of them will just give you a stern warning about what's going to happen if you screw htem over and then lift the restriction upon request
[23:58:29] <rascul> digitalocean if i recall correctly will unblock your 25 if it is blocked, if you open a ticket
[23:59:04] <Dagmar> Genrerally if you're not runnign a mail server having the ISP block 25/tcp outbound is a good idea because it reduces the amount of mayhem that can be caused if someone compromises your site (they can't use it to send spam)

[23:59:31] <CrtxReavr> I see 'protocol ip' in some tc(8) syntax, but what would the protocol keyword be for IPv6?

[23:59:57] <CrtxReavr> ifconfig uses inet & inet6, so that wouldn't match ip.
