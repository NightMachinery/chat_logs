[04:58:49] <ChetManly> so  I seem to have a dud efi system... its a lease buy back, and I have tried to install debian and then try to reinstall the bootloader MANY times.. I also tried to install ubuntu just to see if it was something I was doing wrong. Neither will boot!!! I once had pfsense on this box so I am not sure what the heck the problem is with running a non windows OS on it
[04:59:23] <ChetManly> maybe it installed legacy mode somehow

[05:05:11] <ChetManly> although last night I stummbled on if you set the usb disk as the top of the boot order and let it access it like that it will boot the ubuntu live disk in what appears to legacy mode

[07:32:58] <Codaraxis> I want to run a target script when a new SSH connection is established with a fresh interactive log-in shell. It seems like the best way to go about this is to set an environment variable using ~/.ssh/rc and then check for it in ~/.bashrc to determine whether or not to run the script. Does this seem sensible?

[07:37:12] <rbox> huh?

[07:40:07] <Dagmar> Codaraxis: ...and the final thing you'll need to do (which is really, really ugly) is have a script called from ~/.bash_profile which looks at SSH_CLIENT or SSH_CONNECTION (doesn't matter which one) grabs the _port number_ and then goes and looks at the *parent process id*
[07:40:47] <Codaraxis> This is pure speculation and something I'll hae to look into, but I SSH into a server, launch VNCServer, exit, and then connect to it over VNC. I suspect the environment variables from that initial SSH are being inherited by the VNC server.

[17:22:14] <phogg> abradabara: Linux doesn't have a GUI, to talk comparisons you must reference specific desktop environments.
[17:22:54] <phogg> "How does MacOS X's desktop environment compare to GNOME as shipped by Ubuntu?" would be a better question.
[17:23:27] <phogg> each distribution *may* have customized things to the point where what is true of one is not true of another, especially when it comes to nebulous concepts such as "polish"
[17:24:22] <abradabara> phogg: desktop on linux always feels half done compared to commercial os like windows, haven't tried osx though. Linux being free and people getting paid to work on OSX and Windows probably has a lot to do with it.

[19:19:25] <tirnanog> [twisti]: it can, indeed, be affected by settings. if you enable the pipefail option in bash, the pipeline will yield a non-zero value in the case that any of the commands constituting the pipeline fail (which can be a nuisance, depending on what exactly it is you need to test).
[19:19:34] <tirnanog> that's not the default, though.

[19:22:25] <phogg> if you're already throwing away knowledge of whether it failed, *how* exactly it failed (in terms of exit status) seems like trivia by comparison.

[19:22:33] <tirnanog> [twisti]: yeah, if you're just calling bash -c like that, it won't be enabled. if that be the case, for it to have failed could only be because tee failed - which would be worrying. anyway, you can grab the exit status of any portion of the pipeline immediately afterwards.

[22:06:13] <bitskit> To demystify this a little bit, Archlinux maintainers directly support only certain packages. These are the ones that you normally install with `pacman -Syu packagename`. Packages that are created and mainted by other arch users are most commonly stored in the AUR (archlinux user repository). Unlike pacman (which gives you binaries) AUR packages are compiled from the source code using a PKGBUILD script. You use `g
[22:06:15] <bitskit> it clone https://aur.archlinux.org/packagename.git` to download the package, `cd package` to enter the directory, and then `makepkg -si` to build and install the package

[22:25:14] <sybariten> more specifically, i'd like to be able to treat certain commands like "bookmarks" or something . I see no point in storing complete histories per default, i'd rather be able to pick out what i want to stow away (after this long commandline has been used, i guess) ...
