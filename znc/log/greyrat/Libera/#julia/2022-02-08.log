[12:33:45] <humasect> is it possible to replace/placate the 'end' keyword? an alternate way to form and end blocks
[12:35:09] *** Joins: jjido (~Denis@2a02:c7f:5c91:e700:655c:94b:918d:9e34)
[12:35:19] <mikko> i guess you can do anything with macros, but why?
[12:36:33] <humasect> well, 'function' and 'end' become quite terse for the visual or geometric style of coders 
[12:37:15] <humasect> eg:   function a() .. end    ->    fun a() {..} 
[12:38:11] <adigitoleo> perhaps you would prefer https://www.emojicode.org/ (joke)
[12:38:13] <humasect> rearing its head when multiple 'end' -> macro, quote, function -> end end end. 
[12:38:16] <humasect> heh
[12:38:38] <mikko> personally i don't think }} is any better than end end 
[12:39:04] <mikko> for short functions you can use the shorthand syntax ("f(x, y) = x + y")
[12:39:08] <humasect> not necessarily }, but something single-character and not a language word

[12:40:52] <humasect> ohhh
[12:40:59] <humasect> in quotes though? that is, as string? javascript style
[12:41:20] <mikko> no quotes
[12:41:43] <humasect> just seen another message unrelated, about emoji however coincidental =) to have the editor simply replace the 'end' with whatever letter/char of one's choosing
[12:42:33] <humasect> oh dang i did not know this mikko =) is it the '=' operator?
[12:42:59] <mikko> i'm not sure what you're asking
[12:43:33] <mikko> it's just syntax sugar if that's what you mean
[12:44:36] <adigitoleo> https://www.emojicode.org/ Literally the second example
[12:45:06] <adigitoleo> oops I meant https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/functions/#man-functions
[12:45:16] <humasect> mikko: yeah, basically, sugar question
[12:45:39] <humasect> oh my, how did i not see this. shame
[12:46:37] <adigitoleo> no worries mate, that's why we were confused, you can even use unicode symbols as function names
[12:47:27] <humasect> p(a,b) = if(a) b end      \n        p(true,"ok") -> "ok"      # wonderful
[12:47:45] <humasect> yeah =) =) looking to do work with hebrew/right-to-left 
[12:48:38] <humasect> and now we have libjulia, i think it is ok to throw all of my eggs into this basket now. (after the 'end' debacle!)

[22:18:48] <tatsumaru> do you really think that, there are very little books on Julia
[22:19:50] <ifs[m]> I seriously think that it is a well designed and very powerful language
