[20:18:37] <sonny> how can I return true here <https://bpa.st/DBDQ>? I am trying to create a state machine for this fragment integer `::= digit {digit}`
[20:22:54] <Zipheir> Is that Scheme?
[20:23:22] <sonny> yes, read is not a real function though
[20:23:48] <Zipheir> It seems that it just tail-calls `integer`, so a return in that case is irrelevant?
[20:24:04] <sonny> what I think is that this function can only be used where an end marker exists
[20:24:30] <sonny> I want a machine that accepted input to return true, false otherwise
[20:25:36] <Zipheir> (Oops, it's a self-call.  I'm just waking up.)

[20:27:09] <Zipheir> One or more.  In that case, you'll want to refactor it as two procedures.
[20:28:00] <Zipheir> `digit` to consume one, and (usually) `digits` to consume zero or more.

[20:28:32] <sonny> ah, my digit function does not consume any
[20:28:59] <sonny> and I did not think of practical limits, only the grammar
[20:30:09] <Zipheir> Unless this is a production program, I doubt you need to worry about consuming too-large tokens.
[20:31:39] <sonny> no, it's not. thanks for your help
[20:32:12] <Zipheir> np, feel free to ask any further questions that come up.

[20:59:48] <wasamasa> amazigh: I studied interim for a while and contributed a bunch of things to it
[20:59:57] <wasamasa> amazigh: whoever told you it's based on R6RS is absolutely wrong
[21:00:06] <wasamasa> amazigh: it is easily the worst lisp implementation I've dealt with
[21:01:28] <wasamasa> amazigh: people in here like to dismiss scheme implementations for something forgivable like not having fast continuations or not their favorite macro system or whatever, but interim is fundamentally broken
[21:01:52] <amazigh> good to known.
[21:01:58] <wasamasa> for example GC must be run manually and frees objects that are still referenced
[21:02:12] <wasamasa> thereby guaranteeing that your code will only work correctly if you use global variables
[21:02:21] <amazigh> I want to scrape some ideas to run on bare rpi4
[21:02:37] <wasamasa> their code for that is also suboptimal
[21:02:42] <amazigh> or maybe wasm dunno yet
[21:02:50] <amazigh> wasamasa: why is it suboptimal?
[21:03:04] <wasamasa> people like to dismiss linux for being not ideal, but in terms of code quality, linux is far easier to study and cleaner than interim
[21:03:12] <amazigh> ("done is better than perfect" someone once said)
[21:03:40] <amazigh> Yes, I agree, but I have various problems with unix, starting with the fs
[21:03:46] <wasamasa> it actually has a hardware abstraction layer
[21:03:48] <amazigh> and tcp
[21:03:52] <wasamasa> interim pretends it does, lol
[21:04:00] <wasamasa> there is zero consistency or good engineering practices
[21:04:01] <amazigh> does what?
[21:04:27] <wasamasa> you'd be better off studying the osdev wiki and some random bare metal rust tutorial
[21:04:29] <amazigh> I do not dismiss linux, I want to explore alt paths.
[21:04:41] <amazigh> good to know.
[21:04:49] <wasamasa> the code is full of undefined behavior
[21:05:06] <wasamasa> depending on compiler options chosen it either boots or doesn't
[21:05:33] <amazigh> remind me of... gcc.
[21:05:57] <wasamasa> no, gcc actively exploits undefined behavior and so do most C compilers used in benchmarks
[21:07:36] <amazigh> At this time, the most likely thing that will happen is that will scrape my wanna-be scheme to wasm compiler, a build upon that;
[21:08:18] <amazigh> I have not xp with bare metal; and I do not to show my work; wasm seems to be an acceptable middle-ground.
[21:08:41] <amazigh> s/I do not to show/I do want to show/
[21:10:23] <wasamasa> the other thing is that interim does neither the lisp machine nor the plan9 parts well
[21:11:36] <wasamasa> it's an interesting demo for sure, but overall it felt like I wasted time on it
[21:11:55] <wasamasa> here's a list of things that would need to be fixed: https://github.com/wasamasa/interim/blob/next/TODO.org
[21:12:37] <wasamasa> the author once suggested that the lisp is so bad in terms of ergonomics, he'd rather write a compiler from JS to the lisp
[21:12:47] <wasamasa> if that doesn't make you want to run, I don't know what else will

[21:45:50] <amazigh> wow great! IIRC I never contributed that much to a project that was not mine.
[21:48:12] <wasamasa> the chances of the author working on it again are rather slim because he's currently having way more fun with hardware (like an amiga gpu or his own laptop)
[21:48:27] <wasamasa> but who knows, maybe interim will be made to run on that laptop
[21:48:56] <amazigh> > it's hard to improve it substantially without a full rewrite.
[21:51:22] <amazigh> wasamasa: still, it is an interesting take, isn't? otherwise you would not have devle into it like that?
[21:51:27] <Zipheir> Sounds ominous.
[21:52:11] <wasamasa> well, one of the reasons I did that dive was to give it a fair evaluation for my undergrad thesis
[21:52:22] <wasamasa> I'd welcome more people doing that
[21:52:44] <wasamasa> that is, going beyond the superficial
[21:53:10] <amazigh> yes, that is wasamasa I quoted; they have the experienced developer curse; wasamasa drop some optimisim here and there sometime!
[21:53:38] <amazigh> rudybot: what do you think about experienced developer curse?
[21:53:58] <rudybot> amazigh: that is wasamasa I quoted; they have the experienced developer curse; wasamasa drop some optimisim here and there sometime!
[21:54:02] <amazigh> lol
[21:54:11] <wasamasa> too specific words
[21:54:32] <amazigh> rudybot: what curse a developer can have?
[21:54:51] <rudybot> amazigh: it is somewhat like the senior developer curse.
[21:54:58] <amazigh> haha
[21:57:33] <amazigh> senior developer curse is when you only see problems; that is good in itself, that is what people look for in software engineering positions; you can't solve problems, if there ain't any problem; but it should be balanced among other things with pros, goals, and contexts;
[21:59:49] <amazigh> yes, I agree, even if your work is superficial, it is great; like we can have a convo about it; and also more reviews / audit in software engineering are necessary to make better progress
[22:00:37] <amazigh> even if the convo looks more like a monolog... as it is the case so often with our line of work.
[22:03:56] <Zipheir> wasamasa: It seems like a huge mess atm.
[22:04:08] <wasamasa> that, too
