[00:04:42] <krux02> (get-buffer "*compilation*") does the trick
[00:07:43] <dpk> Down with Emacs Lisp is an interesting paper (from the abstract)
[00:08:12] <dpk> has it ever been considered (other than through the abortive Guilemacs effort) to make Emacs bilingual?
[00:08:54] <dpk> after CL came out, most of the Lisp machines became bilingual between the old vendor-specific Lisp dialects and the new supposed standard, so old code could keep working
[00:10:45] <tromey> I don't think it's been seriously attempted
[00:13:43] <krux02> dpk: there is effort to make some cl extensions, so that cl thinking can be applied ot emacs lisp as well
[00:13:48] <krux02> but many things just don't work
[00:13:51] <dpk> well, the paper is now 20 years old, and in those twenty years Guilemacs has been kicked indefinitely far down the road (and will probably never happen now we have native-comp anyway), and the approach has apparently been to try to patch up the problems in Emacs Lisp (lexical-binding: t, the cl libraries, etc) … which, i have to say, i find an inferior solution
[00:13:52] <dpk> right
[00:14:32] <technomancy> it'd be sweet if they added restarts to elisp tho
[00:14:39] <krux02> dpk: it has to be done in incremental steps
[00:15:02] <dpk> inferior to Guilemacs and supporting extensions in Scheme?
[00:15:20] <dpk> if you could extend Emacs in Scheme, you could add restarts yourself thanks to call/cc ;-)
[00:15:33] <krux02> not everybody is sold on Scheme
[00:15:53] <dpk> (or supporting Common Lisp, whichever, the principle is adding a second language besides Elisp)
[00:16:01] <technomancy> but its the official gnu ubiquitous interactive language for extensions!
[00:16:03] <dpk> (of course, today people would probably want it to be JavaScript …
[00:16:08] <dpk> )
[00:16:29] <krux02> some say scheme is more on the elegant teaching side of languages, not the get your hands dirty languages
[00:16:58] <krux02> and to be honestt, I haven't seen wide adoption of guile scheme at all.
[00:17:06] <acdw> dpk ooh do you have a link?
[00:17:18] <dpk> acdw: to what?
[00:17:18] <acdw> oh nvm lol
[00:17:25] <acdw> what's restarts

[00:18:15] <acdw> technomancy what is it tho
[00:18:16] <technomancy> fair!
[00:18:24] <aidalgol> Why bother formalising governance when you have a cult of personality?
[00:18:34] <dpk> acdw: restarts are the ability for exception handlers to provide places to restart whatever it was that failed, usually with new input provided interactively by the user
[00:18:40] <grym> aidalgol: sometimes it's hard to know the difference

[02:59:30] <mwnaylor> Reading webpages about both emacs and Dvorak keyboard. Several get into remapping keys. Promiment advise seems to be swapping crtl and caps lock. Why? Ctrl requires hold while pressing the key to be altered. Caps lock as ctrl mainly helps with right keys. I find swapping caps lock with esc to me far more effective. Moreso, now that emacs is my primary editor since 2012.
[02:59:54] <mwnaylor> s/advise/advice/
[03:00:02] <twb> mwnaylor: do that, then
[03:01:10] <rk4> mwnaylor: "why" = "personal preference"
[03:01:48] <rk4> i say caps lock can burn! don't swap it, just map both to ctrl :)
[03:03:19] <mwnaylor> rk4: 🤣 I get that. Even though remapped in mx X config, rarely need to lock.
[03:04:20] <mwnaylor> Curious to see what fellow emacs fans do with caps lock, and what, if any esc remapping is done.

[06:50:51] <johnjay> dale: about what. i'm sorry
[06:51:23] <johnjay> oh yeah. so you know how in bash you can delete words similar to emacs
[06:51:34] <johnjay> Meta-backspace? i couldn't do that in macos terminal. but there's an option to treat option as meta
[06:51:53] <dale> johnjay: Yup.
[06:52:04] <johnjay> i assume bash is making some distinction too subtle to comprehend about option
[06:52:07] <johnjay> or zsh i guess
[06:52:08] <dale> I am constantly telling people to turn that on.
[06:52:21] <johnjay> people also told me to use iterm2
[06:52:33] <johnjay> i don't see the advantage
[06:52:41] <dale> johnjay: I think if you leave it off you can use option to enter additional characters, like in most macOS apps.  For example, option-e is an accented e.
[06:53:31] <twb> johnjay: not bash -- readline
[06:53:34] <dale> johnjay: My top reason to use iTerm is to get copy-on-select a la xterm, but it has tons of other fancy features, 90% of which I don't use.
[06:53:53] <johnjay> dale: i noticed something like that. i didn't know that was standard mac practice

[07:52:16] <twb> I don't use them

[17:08:48] *** Joins: aartaka (aartaka@gateway/vpn/protonvpn/aartaka)
[17:08:59] <EdwardIII> what's your motivation anyway?
[17:09:21] <taeaad_> Doom is nice in terms of aesthetics. The space bar functions are a bit odd, though. You can always bind things to space bar if you want to, but I don't know what the things are that pop up when you use space bar in Doom. I also like their splash screen, but I ended up using another minimal one.
[17:10:04] <EdwardIII> never tried doom, my bro swears by it. i did look at their src and borrow some things for my config
[17:10:24] <taeaad_> The other thing is that your Emacs settings also depend a bit on your screen that you use. If you have 27' or better then I just prefer to have to split buffers and that's my fastest coding setup.
[17:10:47] <Guest43> i'm using 29 :)  
[17:11:32] <EdwardIII> split buffers 24/7
[17:11:38] <taeaad_> Doom is fine I think if you code popular sort of things, like Python (and maybe Haskell heh). But it doesn't like it when you pull statistics from Poisson's grave.

[17:14:19] <EdwardIII> use-package?
[17:14:20] <fsbot> use-package is [0] a declaration macro that allows you to isolate package configuration in your user-init-file in a way that is performance-oriented and, well, just tidy. https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package
[17:14:20] <fsbot> [1] *ahem* or you could just M-x customize-group RET
[17:14:21] <taeaad_> So if you are travelling, you want your setup to not exhaust you. So you might want to fiddle with buffer windows initialisation settings.
[17:15:03] <EdwardIII> taeaad_: what does doom provide (or what do you do) that's different from just hitting C-x b and flicking through the buffers to switch?
[17:15:05] <taeaad_> EdwardIII: I use package-install to install something from either Elpa or Melpa. Doom has this sort of config file that you have to uncomment things.
[17:15:38] <taeaad_> EdwardIII: Oh, nothing. I just mean that Doom has nice defaults that will look cool to people that you want to lure to Emacs.
[17:15:54] <EdwardIII> ah ha ok
[17:17:18] <taeaad_> I think Doom is good PR for Emacs in general. Until like I say you use something other than Python (or Java?) and Doom decides to die trying to install it (ESS in my case).
[17:18:18] <EdwardIII> yes, it seems to look lovely out of the box which is important  
[17:18:19] <taeaad_> Some of the old guard here seems to be surprised tha ESS even works for a work setup, but I don't get issues using it. I *do* code in Python too, by the way. So not hating on it.

[17:34:07] <rpav> yeah generally what you can get when it's not like 1 person focused on unofficial language support for $EDITOR, but language authors providing focused effort
[17:34:11] <taeaad_> So if I had to write Java or Typescript code I would certainly use it since you keep on accessing classes that you need to integrate with the rest of the group. Does it also seperate Dev, UAT and Production and that stuff.

[17:36:34] <taeaad_> krux02: I try to avoid working in large teams so mostly I create and avoid my own problems, so I am a bit ignorant about large company coding setups. In my mind the key issue that LSP seems to address is access to live code and classes, methods, and different stages of deployment.
[17:37:21] <krux02> what do you mean with "live code"
[17:38:25] <taeaad_> krux02: Well, my code base for my current project is just managed with Git, so I can't access production environments that typically are called Development, UAT and Production. So there is no web server.
[17:38:29] <krux02> I didn't use LSP yet. But all I understand so far is, it is a compilar running in the background on a server and it provides the idea with error messages, completions etc

[17:40:01] <taeaad_> Then it's simply outsourcing your IDE's messaging, debug and code completion to a web server. But that is also a requirement for deployment.
[17:40:10] <krux02> the main idea here is that LSP defines a unified protocol, and error messages in langauage A are handled identically to error messages in language B and therefore you save a ton of integration code
[17:40:54] <krux02> not sure if "web" is the right term when the server is just accessible on the same machine
[17:41:03] <taeaad_> But you don't want error message in language A and B to be identical though, do you? Seg Fault vs. Null Pointer Exception would not be mutually intelligible.

[17:41:57] <krux02> taeaad_: the encodeing of the error messaging, tho exchange format is identical, not the essages
[17:42:19] <krux02> kind of like every compiler emits error messages in a different format
[17:42:43] <krux02> but lsp requires everything to be exactly the same so that you don't need to implement 100 parsers
[17:42:47] <taeaad_> Maybe I should just try it to understand better why you would want this kind of thing.
[17:42:53] <rpav> like, i could use clangd or i could use ccls or whatever, that could (but doesn't necessarily) interface with other processing (linting, formatting, ...)

[18:06:53] <grym> the big thing that tSNE wants you to believe that isn't true is that cluster distance in the 2d projection is proportional to cluster distance in the real space, and that is a complete artifact of visualisation and nothing else

[18:29:33] <taeaad_> Mathematical statistics has this problem about distinction of equal things, as an example. Some of the open problems are due to the fact that you can say "two atoms of x" but "two times x" is a different statement; it's rather x in some other place in time. That's how I understand it. Some of the work in that direction seems to point to using partitions of sets as a basis for statistics instead of subsets.

[18:33:27] <taeaad_> Boltzmann work directly leads the "x and another atom of x" vs. "x duplicated". In part because it's statistical, and statistics averages things over time. So how would you know anyway if it's something that moved, was copied, or just looks exactly the same? Those things appear to be the same, unless we have some way to distinguish within the mathematical framework. Newton's physics I think avoids this in part because you have a
[18:33:27] <taeaad_> parameter t, and space that can be filled with a point mass or not. So you trace the trajectories to know which things are which over time. A line is the path of one thing.

[23:24:16] <Catie> Help me out, what's "public logging"?
[23:25:06] <pono> Catie: it means not publishing this chat lot to the internet
[23:25:30] *** Joins: casionaut (~casionaut@user/casionaut)
[23:26:02] <Catie> Okay cool, no issues there. Is there a reason that's frowned upon?
[23:26:07] <rpav> no cutting down public trees!
[23:26:21] <rpav> privacy
[23:26:49] <rpav> like keeping your own logs is fine but generally people don't like their possible every interaction publicly available
[23:27:29] <Catie> I can definitely understand that, yeah. Is it not a public event? I guess my assumption was that it would be out there anyway
[23:28:04] <Catie> (to be clear, this is just so I can understand better; I have no intent to post any logs anywhere)
[23:28:43] <Catie> Ooh, I found an explanation

[23:35:01] <Catie> So my interpretation of what I'm finding on the subject of public logging is that it's generally seen almost as a form of surveillance, does that sound about right?
[23:35:19] <aidalgol> That seems a bit dramatic, but sort of.
[23:35:53] <Catie> Yeah, it's not quite what I'm going for, but it's sort of the best shorthand I can think of, you know?
[23:35:58] <grym> the norm is that irc is more like ephemeral discourse than it is like a web forum 
[23:36:03] <grym> so treat it like that 
[23:37:02] <Catie> Yeah okay, that makes sense to me
[23:37:05] <Catie> Thanks everyone!
[23:37:11] <aidalgol> Yeah, that's a better way of putting it.

[23:37:48] <Catie> So little postfix, but a tiny bit. I could at least see what I can figure out! What's up?
[23:39:03] <aidalgol> One sec, ssh-ing in to get the logs...
[23:39:56] <Catie> No worries, I ain't going anywhere!
[23:40:32] <rpav> i have the ORA postfix book from way back when .. somewhere in a storage unit
[23:41:17] <rpav> it's too bad self-hosted spam filtering isn't very good ;/
