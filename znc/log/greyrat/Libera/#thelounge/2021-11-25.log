[14:07:58] <Linn> Hello, is there a way to disable the navigation keyboard shortcuts? You use Option+[character] a lot, and the way my keyboard layout is set up is that Option+[key] becomes a special character, so I can't type, for instance, slashes, without jumping to the help menu at the moment.
[14:08:22] <Linn> This was not an issue on 4.2 but arose now that I updated to 4.3
[14:08:59] <Linn> So I can't, for instance, do /me commands anymore

[15:24:34] <bookworm> with alt? Normally keyboard are setup to switch the char with AltGr
[15:25:03] <bookworm> but no currently those are hardcoded
[15:25:30] <bookworm> Meaning, yes it is possible but you need to patch the code

[15:26:54] <bookworm> How do you do anything on there though? Alt is the usual ley that belongs to the program, not the system. Lots of more complicated application use it
[15:27:50] <bookworm> Do you not have an altgr key? If you do your keyboard setup might be wrong (or at least suboptimal)

[16:08:01] <bookworm> no, but it would make sense to enable that
[16:08:38] <bookworm> I mean yes it is possible sadly but that's purely because it exposes internals by accident you should not be using that
[16:08:54] <bookworm> but you do have access to the irc framework
[16:09:25] <EternalMan> yeah I was just looking at https://github.com/thelounge/thelounge/blob/59280cfdfdf0fe84aef5a770f938fbd4fcf75faf/src/plugins/packages/index.js#L34
[16:10:15] <EternalMan> correct me i'm wrong but that's the api that a plugin recieves in order to add a command?
[16:10:39] <EternalMan> e.g. as in         api.Commands.add("foo", fooCommand);
[16:11:07] <bookworm> yes
[16:11:25] *** Joins: eliocamp9 (~eliocamp@user/eliocamp)
[16:12:09] <EternalMan> possibly for my own entertainment I might look into misusing the irc framework internals - I'd not publish anything for public consumption

[16:13:34] <bookworm> don't look at the master branch though, that did it "wrong"
[16:13:51] <bookworm> it imports a second TL instance, not a good idea
[16:15:19] <EternalMan> right ok
[16:18:11] <bookworm> what do you wanna do?
[16:19:51] <EternalMan> Scan for specific text in channel and respond 
[16:20:18] <bookworm> as in, a bot? Automatically?
[16:20:27] <bookworm> why don't you just write a bot?
[16:20:56] <bookworm> currently the plugin functionality pretty much assumes user input to make stuff happen
[16:21:04] <bookworm> not so much autoresponders
[16:22:11] <EternalMan> yeah I understand that, I don't want to write a bot just for some odd occaisions where an automatic response from me will do
[16:22:54] <EternalMan> it's just for comedic purposes on a particular network :P
[16:23:15] <bookworm> I mean, by write I simply mean deploy
[16:23:28] <bookworm> IRC bots for mostly everything have already been written
[16:24:07] <bookworm> but hey all the power to you. So what you'd need is onMessage(), with the public client as param right?
[16:24:20] <EternalMan> yeah I know, again, it's mostly just the comedy aspect of it coming from 'me'
[16:24:22] <bookworm> that would allow the functionality you are looking for
[16:24:34] <bookworm> znc would allow that with a bot
[16:24:46] <bookworm> or any other multiplexer
[16:24:51] <cottongin> znc another method to attain what you want, then the bot can be you
[16:25:27] <EternalMan> yeah I get that and have thought about it. I like the simplicity of just having thelounge though, you know?
[16:25:36] <EternalMan> less moving parts, as it were
[16:26:11] <cottongin> sure, but in the present state i'm not sure i'd call it more or less "simple" than znc
[16:27:27] <cottongin> and offer you more flexibility in the future if you want to do more than just have comedic replies
[16:27:29] <cottongin> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

[16:29:16] <EternalMan> that all kind of skirts around thelounge plugin system not yet being as... full featured as perhaps it could be
[16:30:19] <EternalMan> I'm not criticising, I love thelounge
[16:31:32] <bookworm> Well we need input from people who actually use the API, including what's missing
[16:32:02] <bookworm> no one said PRs implementing more plugin stuff would not be accepted, it's in a draft form as is
[16:32:45] <bookworm> just recently we added the ability to get a storage location, exactly because I've read the shortcuts plugin code which solved this in a very hacky way
[16:33:16] <bookworm> Now it's a single API call ;)

[16:33:18] <EternalMan> Of course - I'm more of a backend C# guy, my frontend javascript is... passable at best
[16:33:39] <EternalMan> and backend javascript to mention it :P
[16:33:53] <bookworm> then just open an issue with what you are missing so that a discussion can take place

[16:35:38] <EternalMan> some sweet javascript contracts around 😏
[16:35:48] <bookworm> The API is pretty much, someone wanted to do $stuff and needed $thing so $thing got implemented rather than a full fledged designed API that's complete

[19:26:48] <Linn> bookworm I'm forced to use a mac at work. I have alt-gr at home, and I got used to my keyboard layout on a non-broken system. So at work I'd like to turn off the keybindings in the client alltogether since they don't work anyway
[19:27:17] <Linn> Like on Linux/Windows it works fine, since altgr is distinct from alt. On MacOS, there's only Option, no Option-Gr equivalent
[19:27:33] <Linn> so "is this a keyboard shortcut or do you wanna type a character" is ambigious
[19:27:56] <Linn> and since I wanna type a lot more characters than I wanna use options shortcuts I'd like to be able to disable them

[23:21:51] <lazyreader> the whole point of thelounge is that it's a webpage you can pull up in a browser, not sure why you want an app
[23:22:07] <lazyreader> only thing you lose is push notifications
[23:23:50] <morganu> hello oh it is a webpage. OK I didnt realize that.
[23:24:19] <xnaas> On Android you can do the same and not lose push notifications.

[23:24:31] <morganu> ho did I miss it? They were just always talking about servers and not receivers.
[23:24:48] <morganu> I can do the same (as what?)
[23:24:54] *** Joins: Raven5 (~Raven@202.78.234.186)
[23:25:07] <xnaas> Go to the URL for your thelounge instance and add it to your home screen as a PWA.
[23:25:23] <xnaas> This is a feature on Android and iOS both, but Apple is greedy assholes so you can't have push notifications.
[23:25:26] <morganu> ((Wow I appreciate the help)) a friend in the EU is hosting.
[23:25:40] <morganu> what is a PWA?
[23:25:57] <xnaas> Push notifications also only work if the URL has valid certificate for HTTPS, iirc.
[23:26:16] <morganu> is "thelounge instance" on the server?  what is that exactly?
[23:28:03] <morganu> does the owner of the server need to give me a url for the page?
[23:29:37] <morganu> --> I left this note for the guy with thelounge server. -- Is it that you give me a URL for a web page and then I can access it?
[23:29:49] <morganu> bbl, today or tomorrow.
