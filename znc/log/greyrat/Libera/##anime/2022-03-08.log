[00:43:10] <TsundereNoises> not sure if hexchat lets you do much with colors, it's pretty bare-bones, but I think it probably does?
[00:43:11] <MootPoot> but I use IRCloud
[00:43:14] <TsundereNoises> haven't used hexchat in years
[00:43:37] <gamingtoad> it seems like i should switch to a different client

[00:45:38] <MootPoot> well, it wouldn't work as a bot on the IRC side
[00:45:43] <MootPoot> just on the discord side

[04:38:01] <amigojapan> jesse everyone always thinks the world will end
[04:38:54] <JesseDesu> if there is a miscalculation by either russia or nato,
[04:39:16] <JesseDesu> nuclear missiles will start flying
[04:42:47] <amigojapan> its not going to happen and worrying about it wont change the outcome
[04:44:21] <JesseDesu> so you acknowledge it is a possible outcome?
[04:44:53] <amigojapan> but very unlikely but yeah I guess, so as it was during hte cold war

[05:03:23] <ButterNoodle> as taboo as a double headed dildo...
[05:03:41] <ButterNoodle> everyone has one.. no one will admit to using it
[05:05:53] <ButterNoodle> JesseDesu: how much is gas?
[05:06:14] <ButterNoodle> almost $5 a gallon here, and heard it was close to 8 there
[05:07:12] <JesseDesu> Average prices for regular gasoline per gallon in other regional counties: $5.42, San Francisco. $5.43, Sonoma. $5.40, San Mateo
[05:08:05] <MootPoot> the fuck is a gallon
[05:08:15] <MootPoot> is that how much ButterNoodle cums in one go
[05:08:34] <ButterNoodle> a gallon is enough to choke MootPoot 
[05:09:28] <MootPoot> !c 1 gallon 1 Liter
[05:09:29] <ImoutoBot> MootPoot: 1 Liter = 0.219969 Gallon
[05:09:32] <MootPoot> oh
[05:09:42] <MootPoot> so 5 gallons to a liter
[05:09:44] <MootPoot> obo
[05:09:45] <amigojapan> I am still surprised they sell gallons of milk
[05:09:48] <ButterNoodle> uhhhhh
[05:09:53] <ButterNoodle> try to math better
[05:09:55] <MootPoot> amigojapan: do they?
[05:10:05] <MootPoot> biggest I've seen is 4L
[05:10:08] <amigojapan> yup MootPoot, that is a lot of milk
[05:10:20] <amigojapan> 4L is about a gallon
[05:10:25] <ButterNoodle> yes
[05:10:35] <MootPoot> its just under 5L no?
[05:10:53] <amigojapan> in Japan and Mexico they only sell single litters of milk
[05:10:56] <ButterNoodle> !c 1 gallon to litre
[05:10:58] <ImoutoBot> ButterNoodle: 1 US liquid gallon = 3.78541 Liter
[05:11:07] <MootPoot> the fuck is a liquid gallon
[05:11:22] <ButterNoodle> not a solid gallon
[05:11:27] <MootPoot> wh...
[05:11:30] <MootPoot> the fuck
[05:12:05] <MootPoot> >The US fluid gallon is about 14.1% smaller than the dry gallon, while the Imperial fluid gallon is about 3.2% larger
[05:12:11] <MootPoot> ButterNoodle: fix ur shit measurement
[05:12:23] <ButterNoodle> I blame the britts
[05:12:27] <ButterNoodle> its all their fault
[05:12:33] <MootPoot> fucking Jigsy 
[05:12:41] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: they stopped using gallons
[05:13:00] <amigojapan> they joined the rest of the world in metric
[05:13:12] <ButterNoodle> if it werent for the britts, I'd probably be raping an pillaging the Scandinavian coasts rn..
[05:13:26] <ButterNoodle> amigojapan: doesnt make it any less their fault
[05:13:41] <amigojapan> alright
[05:13:50] <MootPoot> oh wow
[05:14:02] <MootPoot> ButterNoodle: according to the figures that JesseDesu posted above
[05:14:11] <MootPoot> gas is actually cheaper here
[05:14:15] <MootPoot> by about ~15%
[05:14:18] <ButterNoodle> well
[05:14:44] <MootPoot> using a online converter for cad and USD - your gas price is 1.18 CAD/Liter
[05:14:50] <MootPoot> 1.81*
[05:14:50] <ButterNoodle> u guys probably arent tryin to suck Iran or Venezuela cock for oil rn are ya?
[05:15:04] <MootPoot> the local price right now is 1.5 per L
[05:15:31] <amigojapan> trump wanted to invade venezuela for their oil
[05:15:37] <ButterNoodle> and yall dont have a problem drilling for u own oil
[05:15:44] <ButterNoodle> amigojapan: probably not a bad idea
[05:15:53] <amigojapan> ouch ButterNoodle
[05:15:57] <MootPoot> we dont drill, we fucking steamblast it out of sand
[05:16:07] <ButterNoodle> the people would be better off being occupied by a first world cuntry
[05:16:19] <MootPoot> if the price of gas ever drops below 1.2  per L the entire operation will be unprofitable
[05:16:21] <ButterNoodle> than a totalitarian military dictatorship
[05:16:24] <MootPoot> thats how dumb it is
[05:16:43] <ButterNoodle> just send it over to us.. we'll suck ur dick
[05:17:43] <amigojapan> jesse  I am just thanksful that trump is not president anymore
[05:17:50] <ButterNoodle> anyway.. yall just need to go ahead and invade... before china and russia beat u to it

[10:17:10] <Nanobot> MC is a lazy girl who spends her time watching anime and playing video games. One day, she is summoned to another world as the hero who will reign over the kingdom of mankind and save the world from the demon king's empire. At first, she thinks the notion is ridiculous, and they must have summoned the wrong person. But then, she realizes that everyone in this world, in both the human and demon realms, are even more useless than she is. If she wants to 
[10:17:10] <Nanobot> have anything close to the basic accommodations she was used to having in the previous world, she has no choice but to get this lazy kingdom off their butts and motivate them to make something more of this world.
