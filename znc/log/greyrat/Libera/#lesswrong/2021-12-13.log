[13:35:02] <shawwwn> why not
[13:36:24] <shawwwn> PapuaHardyNet ^
[13:36:25] <PapuaHardyNet> I don't need them
[13:36:39] <shawwwn> oh?
[13:36:58] <shawwwn> how do you know?
[13:37:34] <PapuaHardyNet> that's mainly because I've been avoiding social situations that would cause me intense anxiety - I barely leave the house
[13:37:51] <shawwwn> that doesn't sound like you don't not-need them
[13:37:51] <PapuaHardyNet> also I don't interview so I don't need xans these days, same with dating
[13:38:40] <shawwwn> I'm sad to hear that you don't date. You deserve to
[13:39:51] <PapuaHardyNet> all in good time - I'll focus more on dating and getting stronger once I graduate
[13:40:45] <shawwwn> that's backwards
[13:42:20] <PapuaHardyNet> oh trust me, this one's not an excuse - I really do think I should make the best of the two opportunities I have right now (the job one and this research project I'm doing)
[13:42:56] <PapuaHardyNet> appreciate your encouragement a lot, btw

[13:47:10] <PapuaHardyNet> admonishment then :) but seriously, the last girl I "dated" sent me a thousand messages over the source of the last christmas to new year
[13:47:58] <PapuaHardyNet> combine that with my distaste for using dating apps because they are anti-privacy, and you can see my reluctance to get active right now
[13:48:24] <shawwwn> that sounds awesome

[13:53:22] <Gurkenglas> you should have told her she's burning something by messaging that much.
[13:55:52] <shawwwn> hardly
[13:55:53] <PapuaHardyNet> Gurkenglas: it isn't easy to reason with some people, you just get sucked into interacting with them more and more, and that means they win
[13:56:17] <shawwwn> I would trade my job for someone that wanted to talk to me that much
[13:57:01] <PapuaHardyNet> no you wouldn't - it feels good in the beginning, but then you realize how bland the conversations are, how boring she is, and how you are the one who has to entertain her to keep the conversation bearable for you
[13:57:47] <Gurkenglas> she was only connected to you via that dating site, right? it seems better to block her openly than let her write those 500 latter messages to a wall.
[13:58:13] <shawwwn> you sure have a way with words Gurkie
[13:58:20] <shawwwn> calling him a wall and such
[13:58:20] <PapuaHardyNet> no, she was a classmate - I avoid dating sites
[13:58:48] <shawwwn> so your plan is to wait until you graduate, and then resume dating your classmates
[13:59:00] <PapuaHardyNet> I did date two girls off of tinder and hinge and they were attractive af, but hey, I messed it up
[13:59:24] <kuudes> shawwwn, what. don't encourage people to take benzoes
[13:59:36] <PapuaHardyNet> shawwwn: no, if I find a Saber-tier girl anytime, I'll make it my priority to convince her I'm her best option
[13:59:54] <kuudes> benzoes are bad. they rarely should be used but temporarily and for specific needs. they seem very antirationalist med
[13:59:54] <shawwwn> but you won't find girls elsewhere
[14:00:08] <PapuaHardyNet> you found emily outside college, right?
[14:00:09] <shawwwn> chill kuudes, I was talking about the antidepressants
[14:00:20] <kuudes> ok
[14:00:35] <shawwwn> I never went to college. I found emily through a friend of a former classmate
[14:00:49] <kuudes> yeah, human contact is good.
[14:00:55] <shawwwn> (should've blocked her)
[14:02:01] <PapuaHardyNet> you never went to college? wow
[14:02:34] <shawwwn> dropped out of highschool too. never went my senior year.
[14:03:14] <PapuaHardyNet> really? that's almost too cool, I'm suspicious
[14:04:03] <Gurkenglas> Is there a googleable keyword for VR-with-a-GPU-in-the-headset?

[14:08:51] <Gurkenglas> Me using them lowers that chance because you can observe that I haven't yet become a street adict?

[14:22:15] <Gurkenglas> shawwwn, you mean, your life is getting more predictable, and there's that mite of uncertainty left about the afterlife, and you imagine that you would clarify it by dying?
[14:22:38] <shawwwn> you know me better than anyone gurkie. yes.
[14:22:51] <PlanckWalk> PapuaHardyNet: If you do a lot of low risk low reward social gambles, you get better at doing high risk high reward gambles with less anxiety (at least compared with doing no gambles at all)
[14:23:21] <PlanckWalk> But hey, drugs might work too.
[14:24:20] <shawwwn> Gurkenglas: the best part is, even if it's super predictable, I won't mind
[14:24:33] <shawwwn> because no mind
[14:24:34] <shawwwn> ha ha
[14:25:00] <Gurkenglas> shawwwn, suppose there's a world with an afterlife, and one without. You get to decide what the shawwwn's in there do. Do you send the one in the afterlifeless world to suicide, or would that miss the entire point because no mind -> no uncertainty reduction?
[14:25:08] <shawwwn>  I don't want an afterlife
[14:25:20] <shawwwn> that sounds horrible
[14:25:25] <shawwwn> the whole point of suicide is to escape life
[14:26:10] <Gurkenglas> that sounds like it's not about the unknown after all, okay. so the appeal of suicide is that life is just bad

[14:48:27] <PapuaHardyNet> man this one has potential
[14:48:32] <Gurkenglas> to gather data on which of the garbage predictions are better than the others, so that one might, having destroyed one's brain enough times, finally update those few neurons correctly.

[14:50:12] <shawwwn> honestly I just want to die so that life is over with
[14:54:48] <Gurkenglas> shawwwn, you have no data on whether the absence of subjective experience counts as better or worse than its continuation. when you choose that plan among many plans which you estimate to have the best result, you're going to make an upward error. you should therefore estimate the utility outcome of plans very conservatively.
[14:54:49] <PapuaHardyNet> yeah, I'm not sure whether recommending anything is disrespectful or not, so I'm just going to say, I feel you man, and I hope you find life more enjoyable eventually
[14:55:34] <shawwwn> it's more interesting.

[15:15:09] <shawwwn> that's just another way of saying that-which-you-want
[15:15:10] <PapuaHardyNet> since we are in a similar timezone, I guess we could try coworking if you want!
[15:16:40] <Gurkenglas> shawwwn, ...you put a different meaning on "curious", too? I thought one is curious about doing something not when one wants to do it, but when one wants to *try* it in order to figure out whether it's good.
[15:17:40] <shawwwn> but there's an underlying motive to curiosity
[15:17:56] <shawwwn> you want to figure out whether it's good, for a reason
[15:18:09] <shawwwn> when that reason is gone, then you'll understand
[15:18:20] <Gurkenglas> yes, an expected utility maximizer will try things in order to gather data even when you don't hardcode in a curiousity instinct
[15:19:07] <Gurkenglas> humans, who value the present much more than the future, need an additional curiosity instinct so that they'll gather data the optimal amount.
[15:20:32] <PapuaHardyNet> you can also try Ultraworking's TWG for a less PapuaHardyNet coworking experience
[15:21:07] <Gurkenglas> coworking as in being webcam-adjacent to one another while we each do our own things? i tried that, it doesn't do it for me.

[15:23:17] <Gurkenglas> let's try it then :o give a link?
[15:23:17] <PapuaHardyNet> one where you clearly define your goals before a work session of 30 minutes, work, and in a break of 10 minutes, you check on each other's progress
[15:23:22] <Gurkenglas> oh uh
[15:23:30] <Gurkenglas> no, that still sounds like the thing that doesn't do it for me.
[15:24:06] <PapuaHardyNet> now i'm curious - why not?
[15:24:48] <Gurkenglas> it's in the same class of interventions as all the usual strategies to combat procrastination - it helps for a little bit, but only by tricking out the part of me that is guarding some other ressource against being exhausted
[15:25:49] <Gurkenglas> i can imagine that it's just guardians all the way down and there is no actual ressource actually being used up - but that doesn't change that tricking out some but not all of the guardians makes the problem worse over time
[15:26:55] <PapuaHardyNet> okay, how about we give it a try
[15:27:22] <PapuaHardyNet> I'm free, have multiple low urgency projects I need to work on, and am willing to do this
[15:27:27] <Gurkenglas> i suspect that actively working with other people works because it tends to tread new paths, further from any ugh fields.
[15:28:44] <Gurkenglas> fineeeeee even though this sounds like it'd use up the quite important ressource that is the gathered evidence that working with other people helps, when this time it'll miss the part that actually makes it help

[20:00:27] <feep> Obormot\Arcturus:  not like deliberately
[20:00:35] <feep> I assume
[20:01:10] <feep> just like, you get jobs on two connections, you jam them in a hashmap, iterate and grab the first one, now you have load balancing without even trying for it
[20:01:19] <feep> fix randomization, one client will start timing out
[20:02:18] <feep> this is why all hashmaps should iterate in insertion order
[20:02:43] <feep> which you can guarantee without worsening the big-O by keeping an embedded linked list between cells
[20:04:11] <gwern> that's a good argument for randomizing between library versions but not at runtime. people are going to depend on it as a convenient ambient source of RNG if it's at runtime, which makes everything impure, had to test or reproduce. library level breaks bad user behavior but without giving them a different way to cheat
[20:04:35] <feep> mhm
[20:04:35] <kuudes> iirc myanmar has had general strike ongoing, and the military junta responded to that by beating doctors etc
[20:04:45] <feep> well, the cheat is just gonna be "never update"
[20:04:45] <kuudes> also in belarus a general strike was attempted
[20:04:50] <pompolic> hashmap ordering as rng? lol
[20:05:35] <gwern> feep: not a very effective way to cheat. not-updating has a *lot* of consequences
[20:06:16] <kuudes> hmm. if you can't even initialize to random as default, what is the proper initialization?
[20:06:23] <kuudes> ie initialize to 0 has similar problems
[20:06:37] <kuudes> you need something that is sort of worse for programmer than random and 0
