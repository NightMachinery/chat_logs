[01:59:37] <Guest23432> "Because the Kasparov - Anand match began on 11th September 1995: the first game was played exactly six years before the event. There was an advertising booklet in London, which was reprinted by Roshal in 64. Kasparov as a King Kong is perched atop one of the twin towers, and Anand, as in the famous movie, shoots at him from the plane."
[01:59:49] <Guest23432> "The first eight games were bland draws. And then, interesting things started to happen. First, Anand won a beautiful game in Scheveningen with White by sacrificing a Rook on d5. Do you understand? Ninth game, with a Rook sacrifice! Then Kasparov won the very next game, again with a Rook sacrifice."
[01:59:56] <Guest23432> "And in the eleventh game, he won with Black, again sacrificing a Rook! Three Rook sacrifices in three World Championship games in a row! This just cannot be. I can't remember anything like that. And these were not just any games, but 9th, 10th and 11th. This is the date - 09/11! Also remember that in many languages, the Rook is called a tower. Do
[01:59:57] <Guest23432> you understand now? Three towers were sacrificed, from game 9 to 11."
[02:01:56] <Guest23432> also "I personally think that Karpov and Kasparov's rituals were ones of the most harmful Kabbalistic rituals of the 20th century. They did unbelievable harm! And what's currently happening in the modern politics was largely predetermined by the successful completion of these rituals."
[02:02:55] <gwern> damn, you'd think kasparov would've at least dealt with putin first
[02:03:32] <Guest23432> No, he was being controlled. Putin is also controlled, anyone who is ever named is being controlled. The controller is mysterious
[02:06:32] <gwern> 'Surov: OK then, let's discuss your residence a bit more. There'a another questions: "You're calling yourself a patriot. What's stopping you from returning to the home country? Why do you prefer to love it from afar?" I'd like to clarify: did you publicly claim to be a patriot? Salov: It's a very interesting question, I've noticed it too. To tell the truth, I've never called myself a patriot....
[02:06:38] <gwern> ...Patriot is actually a strange term. As far as I know, it was introduced into Russian language by Peter Shafirov, one of the ministers and diplomats of Peter the Great. This man was, should I say, of Babylonian descent, an embezzler who was executed for corruption. Sounds very modern, isn't it? So, he introduced this term into our language.' <-- ...is that a way of calling someone a jew

[02:16:41] <gwern> 'Salov: The most concrete question was, "Who?" If we talk about Ilyumzhinov who made him the FIDE president?' 'Sidorov: The thing is, one usually reads articles, books, etc. on some topic only if there's some interesting or controversial premise. I haven't heard any premises. You say that the article says who benefits from that. Who benefits from that, and why?' 'Salov: I've already named two...

[02:19:31] <gwern> 'Surov: While my namesake asked you questions, I came up with two on my own. As I understand from your words, we are controlled by some kind of system of worldviews. Does this system have any leaders? And who controls Putin, in particular? Salov: Concerning Putin and Russia there's a widespread opinion now that Russia is ruled by the Habad sect. Do you know about it? Surov: No. Sidorov: No....
[02:19:37] <gwern> ...Salov: And you don't know who's Menahem Schneierson is? Sidorov: Alas. Salov. Then you should read my book on the topic of the religious cult that exists in the Russian Federation, disguised as the restored Orthodox Christianity. This is a cult of the seventh rabbi of the Habad-Lubavich sect, Menahem-Mendl Schneierson. Of course, the cult is anti-Christian. Even such basic info sounds like...
[02:19:43] <gwern> ...a revelation for you. Can you imagine? People don't have even basic knowledge of what's happening.'
[02:20:36] <gwern> so that explains it. kasparov's kabbalistic rituals are inferior to a true rabbinical cult hijacking orthodox christianity

[02:23:12] <gwern> 'Surov: Tell me, Valery, are your views close to those of Adolf Hitler? Salov: My views are completely opposed to him, because Adolf Hitler was an agent of the powers that wanted the final solution for the European Christians. The World War II ended up with three main results. First: many Christians were killed, in essence, almost the entire Christian male population of Europe. The second...
[02:23:18] <gwern> ...result is the creation of the Israel state. That's why Hitler is called "the founding father of Israel".

Look at the pattern: K, B and L....

[06:03:11] <RiversHaveWings> if they evaluated by resizing to 336x336 instead, then
[06:03:28] <RiversHaveWings> i mean the 336x336 does more *compute*

[07:02:36] <PapuaHardyNet> [A] significant advancement (architect), something involving leadership or management (tech lead, project manager), or something vague enough to serve you well now and in the future (consultant, associate).

[13:24:52] <Obormot\Arcturus> Man this ACX post (the distrust one) is really something
[13:26:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Then in the sixth year, the government says there will be a _glorious_ harvest, and neither tax increases nor revenue enhancements. Savvy people breath a sigh of relief and prepare for a good year. Clueless people assume they’re lying a sixth time. But to savvy people, the clueless people seem paranoid. The government has said everything is okay! Why are they still panicking?" ... well, Scott, maybe it's because the rules
[13:26:46] <Obormot\Arcturus>  are subject to change without notice, and they are made up in the first place by and for the Inner Party (whoever that might be in any given case), and there is in fact nothing stopping the government from saying "glorious" and meaning "lol sux 2 be u"
[13:27:42] <feep[work]> well, I mean, the issue is, the government still needs to know internally if the harvest will be good or bad
[13:28:00] <feep[work]> hence the development of elaborate codes
[13:28:07] <Obormot\Arcturus> Internally, sure
[13:28:26] <feep[work]> internal publications have a tendency of becoming external publications, especially in a high-stakes high-betrayal environment
[13:28:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> But that is not relevant to the question of interpreting their public pronouncements
[13:28:34] <Obormot\Arcturus> Hmm no, false
[13:28:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> They have no such tendency
[13:28:48] <Obormot\Arcturus> Evidence: the Soviet Union (which is the example Scott used)
[13:29:00] <feep[work]> did they actually have internal publications?
[13:29:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> Totally
[13:29:08] <Obormot\Arcturus> But in fact that's not even the fully cynical answer
[13:29:28] <feep[work]> okay, let me try again
[13:29:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> The fully cynical (and - no doubt totally unrelatedly - actually correct) answer is:
[13:29:39] <feep[work]> aa
[13:29:54] <feep[work]> can I try?
[13:29:58] <Obormot\Arcturus> "The government needs to know internally if the harvest will be good or bad? Perhaps so. But does it follow from this that the government *does* know internally if the harvest will be good or bad? It does not."
[13:30:13] <feep[work]> I mean, that too, but like, I was gonna go about halfway cynical towards that
[13:30:21] <Obormot\Arcturus> "But doesn't this imply that things will be very bad very often? Yes."
[13:30:36] <feep[work]> to a first approximation you can't really have external purity standards without them bleeding into the internal
[13:30:47] <feep[work]> so you still need a code in the inner circle
[13:31:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> "a code" in what sense
[13:31:12] * feep[work] rethinks
[13:31:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> "you can't really have external purity standards without them bleeding into the internal" ... yes you can
[13:31:27] <feep[work]> okay, hang on, we're assuming the inner circle is competent, you're right, that's not a given by far
[13:31:44] <feep[work]> take 3: the purity standards are probably coming *from* the inner circle.
[13:31:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> It needn't be competent, it needn't be monolithic, it needn't be united, etc.
[13:31:56] <Obormot\Arcturus> "the purity standards are probably coming *from* the inner circle" also false
[13:32:07] <feep[work]> eh, in the soviet union?
[13:32:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> The very same
[13:32:20] <Obormot\Arcturus> (But also America, today)
[13:32:23] <feep[work]> like, I thought the whole point was that stalin was pushing the ideological shit
[13:32:41] <Obormot\Arcturus> Which ideological shit specifically
[13:32:51] * feep[work] thinks
[13:32:57] <feep[work]> I don't know enough about that to talk about it.

[13:34:37] <feep[work]> hm. idk then
[13:35:09] * feep[work] wanders back to doing work things :D
[13:35:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> There's a famous story, I don't have a reference right now, of how, during World War 2, there was some heroic ... bomber pilot, I think, some such thing
[13:36:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> The guy does some heroic shit, survives, gets awarded some medals and what have you, and as part of his reward / recognition for his actions, he's sent to Moscow to meet with Stalin and so on
[13:37:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> And when he gets there, he comes into the Kremlin, he meets all these Party officials, and he's invited to join them for a fancy dinner and so on, they all toast his heroics and praise him and all that
[13:38:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> And then when it's over, he leaves, and promptly shoots himself
[13:38:47] <nshepperd2> hm yes makes sense
[13:39:00] <Obormot\Arcturus> Because the whole rest of the country is starving, right? People are happy to get a crust of bread
[13:39:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> And here are these Party dudes, all fat and healthy and dining on caviar and sipping tea and drinking expensive vodka
[13:40:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> And they *clearly* are not even slightly ashamed of this, they think absolutely nothing of indulging in their usual over-the-top inner-circle luxuries, while right outside their walled fortress there are people literally dropping dead from hunger
[13:41:46] <Gurkenglas> should have seen that coming, it was right in the name
[13:42:31] <nshepperd2> 'I'm just saying that this study has enough yellow flags that it's worth checking out in more depth to see if anything's wrong with it. (also, the lead author is named Dr. Troller, and I am a nominative determinist)' lol

[13:45:33] <Obormot\Arcturus> Anyway, the point is, the inner circle of power are *never* true believers. Never.
[13:46:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> In the Soviet Union, the more powerful and the more "on the inside" a person was, the more cynical and shamelessly amoral they were

[16:07:57] <kuudes> I wonder if that watermarking is breach of ePrivacy btw
[16:08:02] <kuudes> ie the thing of cookie consents
[16:08:22] <kuudes> because it bans storing data on user machine without specific consent
[16:09:17] <PapuaHardyNet> they'll just force you to give consent for watermarking to access those PDFs as a researcher
[16:14:27] <kuudes> thats not consent
[16:14:45] <kuudes> gdpr specifies that you can't withold service for consent, or the consent is not consent
[16:15:01] <kuudes> consent needs to arise without any specific benefit
[16:15:04] <kuudes> no trades etc
[16:15:15] <PapuaHardyNet> huh. well, that would be nice
[16:16:49] <kuudes> and in eprivacy there are not those legitimate interest reasons; it specifies that for storing data on client machine, only consent allows that
[16:25:35] <nshepperd2> think they would probably just argue that the watermark is part of the pdf, which you consented to download

[16:48:22] <feep[work]> which perseveres not just because of the ruthless environment, but also because to these people, codeswitching is near trivial
[16:48:59] <feep[work]> so saying harvests will be bad would not be seen as anything to do with harvests, but primarily an attack on the leadership
[16:49:32] <feep[work]> but you still need to communicate accurately, because knowledge is power, and you don't want to be *blindsided* by a crisis, or your allies to be
[16:50:31] <feep[work]> you may causally accept that the masses are starving, but you probably don't want to find this out by means of another inner circle's member's inscrutable moves turning out to be building an attack against you on the back of the disgruntled populace suffering from a food crisis that you had no idea about.
[16:51:52] <feep[work]> so you need to acquire accurate knowledge while giving no appearance of threatening or contradicting another member. result: the dictator defines the "carrier wave" - the propaganda/ideology, and then actual information is modulated on top

He gave me a sneaky smile and said that he and other ‘computers’ had taken their ‘revenge’ on that guy. When I asked how, he said they used to mess up his calculations without the professor knowing about it.'
