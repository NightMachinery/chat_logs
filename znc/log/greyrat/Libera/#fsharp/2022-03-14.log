[08:49:31] <sonny> I started a task that should return int but the result is unit, any idea why? <https://bpa.st/ECNQ>

[10:07:37] <jinsun__> sonny: what is unit there? x on line 12 seems to be int, changing the %a to %d in line 13 prints "sum(10) is 55"
[10:08:36] <jinsun__> no idea how %a is supposed to work, it was giving weird errors
[10:22:40] <sonny> jinsun_ my mistake I thought %a printed the object or it's toString which I wanted to use to debug
[10:23:16] <jinsun__> %A does that, %a is something different
[10:24:14] <sonny> x seems to get changed to unit when I run my code
[10:24:30] <sonny> ` error FS0001: This expression was expected to have type↔    'int'    ↔but here has type↔    'unit`
[10:27:03] <jinsun__> oh that is not the problem with x
[10:27:18] <jinsun__> main has to return int, printfn returns unit
[10:27:36] <jinsun__> put a 0 after the printfn line
[10:28:02] <jinsun__> I ran in .net interactive notebook that's why I didn't see that error
[10:30:25] <jinsun__> your Console.OpenStandardOutput () trick for CopyToAsync also behaved differently with .net interactive btw, worked only with console application in the terminal
[10:32:24] <jinsun__> printfn works in both places, not idea what Console.OpenStandardOutput is doing that it doesn't work in notebooks
[10:45:13] <sonny> hmm, weird
[10:45:41] <sonny> oh I know
[10:45:57] <sonny> the web notebook thing is probably using something else
[10:46:09] <sonny> I explicitly wanted to print to the console
[10:46:10] <sonny> thanks
[10:56:19] <jinsun__> yeah but it says standard output, so I was assuming it would change from console to whatever notebook was using as standard output, but apparently not
[10:57:06] <jinsun__> Console.Write also works in notebooks weirdly
[11:02:05] <sonny> yeah, you'd just have to get whatever stream is being used for the notebook
