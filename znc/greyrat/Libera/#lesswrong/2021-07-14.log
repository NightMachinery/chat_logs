[00:13:37] <ggreer> so as far as I can tell, all four of these people still haven't been tried. they got their bail money back in late may
[00:14:13] <ggreer> and in late july, they're having preliminary hearings to determine if there's probable cause to actually have a trial
[00:14:33] <gwern> last july? maybe postponed heavily due to covid backlogs and not being violent
[00:15:01] <ggreer> it also looks like they went back and forth trying different plea deals, but they all fell through

[01:05:17] <rmmh> ah are they mostly in the far north?

[01:05:59] <saturn2> there are only about 25 finns but the country is like 900 million square miles
[01:05:59] <Obormot\Arcturus> Reading https://www.datasecretslox.com/index.php/topic,3981.msg0.html#new ... I gotta shake my head at this part:

[01:06:06] <Obormot\Arcturus>  $25 million."
[01:06:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> And, like ... that would be bad, though

[01:07:10] <Logos01> That's wildly miscalibrated towards plausibility.
[01:07:16] <rmmh> Logos01: a believer trying to force a win
[01:07:31] <Obormot\Arcturus> What if Eric Adams is revealed to have taken a bribe and then he's not elected and then whatsherface is elected instead - that's a disaster
[01:07:43] <Logos01> rmmh: Jane Smith smart smart smart smart smart....
[01:07:45] <rmmh> I'd think the proper prior for a holy book being true is like, at _most_ 1/$number_of_books_published
[01:08:09] <rmmh> and that's even assuming that there's one true religion
[01:08:19] <rmmh> (or perhaps 1/$number_of_religious_books)
[01:08:26] <saturn2> Obormot\Arcturus: scott is probably under that impression, i'd say
[01:08:30] <kuudes> rmmh, I have encountered reindeer some times and I have not seen reflective antlers. but iirc it would be a new thing, so that would explain it, my last encounter is some 10 years ago

[01:08:59] <rmmh> Logos01: yeah the comments properly eviscerate it, just thought you'd get a chuckle
[01:09:03] <Logos01> Like even if you just give it the "1/${NUM_RELIGIONS}" that's still vastly below 1%.
[01:09:11] <rmmh> right
[01:09:11] <Logos01> Well, yes. Yes indeed.
[01:09:19] <kuudes> wait, what is indiscretion again?
[01:09:37] <rmmh> it kind of fits the human thoughts of probability-- the intuitive "tiny" probability is 1%
[01:09:43] <Logos01> And I think that the 1/Religions.Number() is like ... the absolute most generous you can possibly be.
[01:09:45] <rmmh> when no, that's a huge prior
[01:10:05] <kuudes> 1% is the probability of my typos though, sadly
[01:10:13] <Logos01> Although you'd have to actually bump that to 1/( Religions.Number() + 1 ) to be accurate.
[01:10:23] <Logos01> The +1 is them all being wrong.
[01:10:24] <ggreer> kuudes: discretion is keeping things on the down-low. don't tell lots of people. etc
[01:10:35] <kuudes> thanks ggreer
[01:10:36] <rmmh> shouldn't you also have a bias against new religions
[01:10:42] <kuudes> whats its opposite in this meaning?
[01:10:56] <Logos01> rmmh: This is a common criticism of Bayesian Statistics, yes.
[01:11:22] <rmmh> if there's a personal god waiting out there, why would the true revelation come in 2021, and not uh, back when homo sapiens first developed
[01:11:39] <kuudes> well there is a problem that many reasonable people seem to believe into a religion
[01:11:48] <kuudes> which is a confusor
[01:11:55] <kuudes> but this may be waning
[01:12:16] <rmmh> is there a shorthand for the fallacy of 'there must be a higher power' => 'my religion is true' ?
[01:12:37] <Logos01> (The idea that you can validly normalize probability from the outset by using all currently identified probable outcomes to begin analysis which is the core presumption of bayesian statistics -- sometimes people object to this presumption on the basis that you need to normalize against the set of all outcomes you don't know about as well.)
[01:12:54] <saturn2> kuudes: in this context indiscretion means something that causes a scandal
[01:12:57] <Logos01> rmmh: Honestly I don't know if there is, but it is a common as fuck one.
[01:13:06] <kuudes> oh. thanks saturn2
[01:13:29] <Logos01> rmmh: If I had to I would name it the "Deism Theism Equivocation Fallacy".
[01:14:02] <ggreer> kuudes: it's kinda annoying because discrete means different things in different contexts. in science-y stuff, it means the opposite of continuous. for a single person, it can mean either being free or competent enough to judge things for oneself, but has the connotation of being competent enough to *not* publicly profess dumb or incriminating things
[01:14:07] <Logos01> I.e.; "I have an argument/belief that supports deism, and therefore my theism is true."
[01:14:21] <rmmh> it seems like most historical christian apologetics fall into that category. hey there's definitely a creator/higher power, therefore tithe to your local parish

[01:24:53] <Logos01> Though he also borrows some from prior apologetics, too.
[01:25:07] <ggreer> I kinda liked sam harris's debate with craig. they talked past each other the whole time, but harris had one good point: everything craig said about christianity could be said (and has been said) about islam (and plenty of other monotheisms)
[01:25:13] <Logos01> In small summary: the idea that "to begin to exist" is "to be created".
[01:25:28] <Logos01> Because this lets them equivocate between "creation" and "Creation" -- and yes the capital C matters.
[01:26:05] <Logos01> The common assertion is that things that begin to exist have a cause; and then they move on to say that said cause must be an uncreated personal Creator.
[01:26:19] <Logos01> And that this creator must be a being, because Creation implies agency.
[01:26:27] <Logos01> You see the faults here?
[01:29:15] <Logos01> Of course, Craig *HAS* to pull this "Creator Being" thing because he also believes it's self-evident that consciousness can be transcendental to time and space.
[01:30:11] <Logos01> (This is why I harp on the whole ontology-of-the-virtual thing with holes and such.)
[01:33:32] <Logos01> ggreer: You know, it's rather amazing how little impact that sort of thing has on apologists.
[01:34:37] <rmmh> you don't become an apologist by being swayed by argument or evidence
[01:34:59] <Logos01> Well that's true.

[03:34:50] <gwern> ah, is that why? I always wondered. but no, I'm pretty sure I'm using pipe and parens correctly for alternating and capturing, it's just the previous doesn't work
[03:36:18] <gwern> specifically, I was trying to search-and-replace hyphens in numerical ranges like '10-20' into '10--20', but unfortunately, your basic '\([0-9]+\)-\([0-9]+\)' -> '\1--\2' matches a *lot* of constructs, like urls, which have things like 'http://.../a-10-3-9-97' etc.
[03:37:22] <gwern> under this regexp trick, I *should* be able to skip 3-cluster matches by matching those first, alternating, and then doing the 2-cluster capture as before:   '[[:digit:]]+-[[:digit:]]+-[[:digit:]]+\|\([[:digit:]]\)-\([[:digit:]]\)' -> '\1--\2'. but no
[03:37:44] <Urchin[emacs]> gwern: can you unmatch urls?
[03:38:04] <gwern> how would I 'unmatch'? the whole problem is that emacs apparently has no easy negations

[05:09:10] <saturn2> they could make a very thin headphone port that doesn't cover the entire plug, just clamps around it from the sides

[07:50:55] <Logos01> I actually disagree with this statement, but only in a dystopian sense.
[07:53:05] <Logos01> The worst of all tyrannies are those which are apathetic to those oppressed; for while the malicious might find a certain amount of suffering sufficient, and the benevolent might notice their oppression does more harm than good; the apathetic oppresses without noting the intrinsic worth of the oppressed and thus can 'achieve' oppressive excess without calibration.

[08:23:53] <quanticle> Well, I'm not all that familiar with DAPL, but I've been looking into the Line 3 replacement, which is also getting a lot of protests here.
[08:24:28] <quanticle> And literally the reason Line 3 is changing routes is because the original route took it below a bunch of protected wetlands and whatnot
[08:24:35] <quanticle> And the new route avoids many of those places
[08:24:40] <quanticle> And people are still protesting it
[08:24:42] <Logos01> quanticle: Some of the biggest issues with the DAPL in specific is that they put it straight through multiple indian reservations and used eminent domain on reservation land to do it.
[08:24:44] <quanticle> On general principle
[08:25:21] <Logos01> It would've been different if they'd bothered compensating the tribes or negotiating usage rights.
[08:25:48] <quanticle> So my prior is that DAPL could have had the perfect routing and still it wouldn't have mattered, people would have protested the shit out of it anyway. Water is wet, fire is hot, Americans hate infrastructure, news at 11
[08:26:02] <Logos01> Well there's also that.
[08:27:02] <Logos01> But again: protesting because you hate the idea of infrastructure and protesting because they're gonna tear down your house, your neighbor's house, and the grave your grandparents are buried in and give you jackshit in compensation is a different story y'know?
[08:28:05] <Logos01> Which is my point: this is a manifestation of indifference; destroying a community because you do not even acknowledge the community's existence, let alone acknowledge the harm done to said community.
[08:28:42] <Logos01> (I'm *purely* concerned about the categorization here, not making any other arguments about it.)
[08:29:16] <quanticle> Well, to go back to the notion that the US as "more totalitarian" than China, well... in China they don't even give you compensation for bulldozing your house to put in the freeway bypass.
[08:29:32] <nshepperd2> isn't eminent domain supposed to require compensation
[08:29:40] <quanticle> So yeah, US is more centralized and totalitarian than China. That's why we're so much better at building infra... oh wait

[09:45:50] <Logos01> rmmh: SLC is one of the higher altitude cities in the US so it has a lot lower absolute humidity, meaning that even at higher relative humidities an evaporative cooler will be more effective than at lower altitudes.

[09:47:41] <feepbot> Mayfly invasion in Northeast Ohio - YouTube
[09:48:47] <Logos01> I don't think they were doing the nighttime streetlight shutoffs during mayfly season.
[09:51:00] <Logos01> But anyhow, yes; once I actually buy the house I'm currently renting I'm seriously considering spending a solid chunk on getting a better cooling solution than the swampcooler.
[09:53:07] <rmmh> Logos01: oh, interesting! Don't normal AC units involve evaporative cooling regardless, or is that only a side effect of the dehumidification so it's less powerful than evaporative?
[09:53:43] <quanticle> The "evaporative cooling" in a normal A/C takes place entirely inside a closed loop
[09:54:16] <Logos01> rmmh: quanticle++
[09:54:16] <quanticle> The coolant "evaporates" inside a closed tube and absorbs heat from inside the room
[09:54:21] <rmmh> Normal A/C produces water as a byproduct 
[09:54:25] <Logos01> They use the same principle as your refrigerator.
[09:54:28] <quanticle> Yeah, but that's outside
[09:54:43] <Logos01> Well no... AC's don't produce water.
[09:54:50] <quanticle> Well, they condense water out of the air
[09:54:55] <quanticle> If it's really humid out
[09:54:56] <Logos01> Water condensation occurs not as a byproduct but as an externality.
[09:55:16] <Logos01> They have parts that get super cold and those super cold parts are exposed to air, and that can cause condensation on the exterior.
[09:55:36] <Logos01> This is better described as a nuisance or malfunction; something to be managed and not a desired function.
[09:55:48] <quanticle> Well, it's partially a byproduct. The "conditioning" that the Air Conditioner does is condensing the water out of the air to reduce humidity.
[09:55:52] <rmmh> I suppose the heat gained by condensing water equals the heat heat lost by evaporating it
[09:56:03] <quanticle> It's not evaporating any water, though
[09:56:11] <quanticle> The coolant is some HFC substance
[09:56:12] <Logos01> It's one of the reasons why for example apartment tenemants and business complexes will put minimum AC temperature targets -- to prevent the AC units from freezing over.
[09:56:15] <rmmh> some of them evaporate the condensed water 
[09:56:22] <rmmh> After it drips off the coils
[09:56:23] <quanticle> Oh, portable A/Cs, yeah
[09:57:01] <quanticle> Yeah, but that reduces the cooling efficiency of the A/C. I know when I had a portable A/C in Seattle, I ran it in non-evaporating mode
[09:57:07] <quanticle> And just had a hose and a bucket
[09:57:50] <Logos01> rmmh: So anyhoo, yeah, this is actually a thing that's the "quirk" of heatpumps vs AC units.
[09:58:04] <Logos01> Because heatpumps just have reversible condenser/evaporator units.
[09:58:45] <Logos01> So you just swap those out depending on if you want it to be hotter inside than outside, or cooler inside than outside.
[09:59:03] <quanticle> Yep. Condenser = hot; evaporator = cold. If you make the inside the condenser, it's a heater. If you make the inside the evaporator, it's an A/C
[09:59:18] <Logos01> rmmh: This is actually how the ductless "mini-split" heatpumps I was talking about the other day work -- they don't move air.
[09:59:26] <Logos01> They move refrigerant.
[10:00:57] <Logos01> You then just slap a blower on the interior phase-exchanger (condenser/evaporator general term) and Bob's your uncle.
[10:02:33] <Logos01> Also, "phase-exchanger" just sounds more scifi.

[19:03:31] <shawwwn> that's how it can go from 512 channels to 64 channels
[19:03:47] * nshepperd2 squints. just converting back from clip text embedding -> image embedding space and using it as a prompt... works? except it feels like the number of waifus has increased
[19:04:09] <shawwwn> so of course every nn.Linear can be converted into a conv1d with kernel size 1
[19:04:30] <shawwwn> but that doesn't mean it's a convolution
[19:04:42] <nshepperd2> probably because there are so many waifus in the source dataset that it matched that part of the distribution too
[19:05:15] <shawwwn> the whole point of convolution is to convolve a filter over a signal, which implies a kernel size > 1
[19:05:43] <shawwwn> if you convolve [a, b, c, d] with [1], you get [a, b, c, d]
[19:06:13] <nshepperd2> doing the forward conversion from image -> text embedding and training the model on that instead might? fix it though

[22:48:51] <PapuaHardyNet> I read a bit of Steve Krug's "Don't Make me Think", and I've been thinking ever since - the Linux operating system is surprisingly not user-friendly
[22:49:37] <PapuaHardyNet> I've been blind to its lack of usability, mostly because of my overfocus on open source, flexibility, and simplicity of code base and the tools I use

[23:06:57] <ggreer> apparently some member of parliament named a (previously anonymous) soldier who shot 5 unarmed civilians on bloody sunday: https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2021-07-13/debates/CDF9AFDF-4BFA-4FA1-8481-B68CAF2DDB5F/ArmedForcesBill#contribution-768D1B2D-D4F5-405E-812A-8903DCEF768A
[23:06:58] <Robomot> Armed Forces Bill - Tuesday 13 July 2021 - Hansard - UK Parliament [] (Hansard record of the item 'Armed Forces Bill' on Tuesday 13 July 2021.)
[23:07:19] <ggreer> but all the papers in the UK are refusing to mention the soldier's name or even link to the transcript of what was said
[23:12:46] <ggreer> it reminds me of how zero major papers published those danish muhammad cartoons
[23:15:21] <Logos01> nshepperd2, PapuaHardyNet -- I couldn't say; I could say that I was frustrated by their responses to the point of verging on tears.
[23:15:46] <Logos01> Like they tried to hand me a flight pillow and suggest I just shove it under the seat cushion as though that would fix the problem of the seat being about to fall apart.
[23:16:38] <Logos01> When I pointed at the loose bolts and showed the seat bottom shaking off the floor of the plane they got less and less tolerant with me; I was the squeaky wheel that was delaying the flight for everyone.
[23:18:26] <Logos01> kuudes: I mean, literally sitting anywhere else on the plane would have done the trick. But instead of being willing to move me elsewhere they decided to declare that my statements about feeling unsafe -- and I was very careful about my wording, as it was like 2003/2004 -- and somehow in their brains "I will be injured if I try to sit in this seat. This seat is not safe." was translated into "this 
[23:18:32] <Logos01> person threatened to hurt someone."
[23:19:03] <Logos01> So instead of reseating me elsewhere they just kicked me off and wanted me to be arrested.
[23:19:43] <Logos01> (My then-girlfriend got herself kicked off the plane too when she realized I was being kicked off. We hadn't managed to be seated with each other, so they didn't know she and I were together until she spoke up.)
[23:20:50] <Logos01> I don't know what exactly she said to the airport rep when I was dealing with the police but she wound up getting us on a standby flight status with a different airline.
[23:35:49] <rmmh> you threatened to hurt yourself by saying that the seat would hurt you, clearly

[23:51:33] <gwern> welp, today's opera trip went poorly. I hit every light on the way there and got stuck behind slow cars (on the way back I hit them and got stuck behind *two* school buses), so I arrived on the dot. normally, that'd be perfect timing: just the right time to get a ticket and into a seat a minute or two before it started. unfortunately, it turns out the theater has *merged* its ticket &...
[23:51:39] <gwern> ...concession stand, and there was a line of like 20 people, mostly kids, waiting to get concessions (and me, waiting for one (1) ticket). after 10 minutes, the line had gotten longer, and I didn't think I'd even moved up halfway . at that point I concluded I'd miss the best song in _Porgy & Bess_ entirely, and left the theater in disgust to do the rest of my errands.
[23:53:05] <gwern> even for an opera, missing >20 minutes means missing a pretty good chunk of it...
[23:53:10] *** Joins: pompolic (~bruh@91-137-144-5.opticon.hu)
[23:54:34] <gwern> when I checked my phone and began to estimate how long it'd take just to reach the front of the line, never mind actually get seated and start watching, I decided to abandon the crying sunk cost. I'll watch a met hd stream on my computer tonight for free with no waiting -_-
[23:54:34] <ggreer> :(
[23:55:38] <gwern> and uh I am having second thoughts about going to the rebroadcast of _Agrippina_. it was wicked funny and gorgeous, but if I have to like order a ticket through the mail or wait half an hour in a line, that's enough to give me second thoughts. remember, these tickets are like $20
[23:56:00] <gwern> sorry, $22
[23:56:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: ... they don't have electronic ticket machines?!
[23:56:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> What kind of Stone Age theater is this
[23:56:19] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: they do but I've tried using them and they are ass
[23:56:23] <Obormot\Arcturus> ??
[23:56:30] <gwern> bizarre glitches
[23:56:33] <Obormot\Arcturus> Wow
[23:56:47] <gwern> the first time I tried, I ran into some sort of issue and gave up and just bought a ticket at the window in a fifth the time
[23:57:15] <gwern> I wonder if they were even operating today, because of the whole hygiene theater... I didn't even look at them
[23:57:46] <gwern> anyway, wanna bet that ticket prices aren't discounted at all despite this shit? ~hidden inflation~
[23:58:08] * gwern believes inflation should include hedonics. and hedonics is not a one-way ratchet.

[23:59:19] <gwern> man, do I want to go to _Dune_ even if the reviews are positive? today was the middle of the afternoon on a weekday in summer when there was no new release... what would an actual new movie or weekend be like
[23:59:21] <shawwwn> 1k of which came from the last two weeks apparently lol https://socialblade.com/twitter/user/rivershavewings/monthly
[23:59:30] <shawwwn> I was hoping you'd get noticed
