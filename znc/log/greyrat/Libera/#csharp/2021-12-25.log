[00:09:10] *** Joins: lz_ (l@gateway/vpn/protonvpn/lz/x-63480406)
[00:09:22] <DevJohnC> failure to save to a db should result in an exception being thrown
[00:10:00] <viaSanctus> its important you know i'm a complete noob first
[00:10:23] <viaSanctus> i'm binding ui elements to entity value
[00:10:25] <viaSanctus> s
[00:10:43] <viaSanctus> but there's not always a "mapped" value
[00:11:37] <BtbN> lz_, you want Windows 11 for WSLg. Everything prior was a clusterfuck.
[00:11:39] <viaSanctus> so i create a new entity -> but there's also a visual that shows if the value was saved or not, so i thought id have a property that returns the ID != null
[00:11:54] <viaSanctus> it works...but it feels ugly
[00:12:01] <viaSanctus> and havent found another way in fluent/nhibernate

[00:13:10] <lz_> BtbN: i dunno i'd rather make a dualboot with linux than install w11
[00:13:39] <lz_> do you guys know if I can "share" my chrome profile between computers without signing in to google? I'm looking for something like a local cloud server for these things
[00:14:08] <lz_> chrome, or edge or firefox I don't care
[00:14:20] <BtbN> lz_, why?
[00:14:26] <BtbN> WSL got a lot better on Win11
[00:14:36] <BtbN> and they decoupled it from the OS, so it can receive independent updates
[00:14:39] <lz_> BtbN: what's different from 21h2?
[00:15:04] <lz_> hmm maybe then
[00:15:18] <BtbN> X11/Wayland/ALSA/PA support, accelerated OpenGL
[00:15:27] <lz_> I don't remember why I didn't want w11 but I didn't want it
[00:15:47] <Diablo-D3> wslg doesnt ship in 10
[00:15:49] <lz_> aren't they forcing online accounts or sth?
[00:15:54] <Diablo-D3> no, they arent
[00:16:00] <Diablo-D3> and they never will
[00:16:06] <lz_> Diablo-D3: it says there's cuda in 21h2 in the link I pasted above
[00:16:25] <BtbN> Win11 forces an account to download stuff from the Store. And you download WSL from the Store on Win11...
[00:16:40] <Diablo-D3> I dont believe thats correct lz, Im pretty sure its slated for 22h1
[00:16:42] <lz_> BtbN: well lol, here's a reason I don't want it then
[00:16:51] <Diablo-D3> BtbN: thats somewhat wrong btw
[00:16:54] <lz_> Diablo-D3: well the link above is docs.microsoft.com
[00:16:58] <Diablo-D3> the store works with local accounts
[00:17:14] <BtbN> Diablo-D3, well, how do I download stuff from the store without being logged into a Live Account then?
[00:17:28] <BtbN> Unless they changed that back already, it doesn't work.
[00:17:30] <Diablo-D3> you login with a microsoft account normally.
[00:17:34] <lz_> BtbN: maybe it's the same as w10. it makes you think you need an account, but you just cancel and it installes wsl anyway
[00:17:47] <lz_> dark patterns everywhere
[00:17:49] <BtbN> No, I had to find that out when installing a Laptop for a Co-Worker
[00:18:04] <BtbN> Couldn't install WSL for him, since I didn't want to log into my MS account on his new Laptop
[00:18:07] <Diablo-D3> lz_: whats weird is, I havent actually seen that dark pattern in w11
[00:18:22] <BtbN> So the Win11 store forcing MS Account Login is very much a thing
[00:18:24] <Diablo-D3> I think they may have gotten rid of it
[00:18:42] <Diablo-D3> BtbN: it requires a microsoft account to be added, _not_ to be logged in with
[00:18:58] <BtbN> Diablo-D3, yes, so? I still didn't want to log into my MS account on someone elses laptop
[00:19:08] <Diablo-D3> sure, and he can use his ms account on his laptop
[00:19:18] <BtbN> Yes, because I know his credentials, and if he even has one lol
[00:19:30] <Diablo-D3> lz_ was asking about microsoft eliminating local accounts
[00:19:36] <Diablo-D3> which they cannot as per corporate policy
[00:19:54] <Diablo-D3> the moment they do is the day windows is never allowed on corporate/enterprise machines again
[00:19:55] <BtbN> At no point as anyone but you talking about local accounts.
[00:19:57] <BtbN> *was
[00:20:35] <lz_> apparently you can self host stuff with firefox: https://mozilla-services.readthedocs.io/en/latest/howtos/run-fxa.html not sure I wanna try it
[00:20:52] <Diablo-D3> btw, you can also just build your own wsl distros
[00:21:03] <BtbN> Last time I looked at Self-Hosted Firefox stuff, it was all Python 2. So I walked away from it.
[00:21:35] <Diablo-D3> they rewrote it in nodejs iirc
[00:22:30] <lz_> I think I'll just try wsl in win11 inside a vm just to see if I want this shit on my computer
[00:22:52] <lz_> I can't remember what made me never want to install this, I should have written it down somewhere
[00:23:13] <Diablo-D3> heh, I use wsl, its actually nice
[00:23:27] <Diablo-D3> its the only way to make windows actually useful for work purposes
[00:23:39] <Diablo-D3> else you're 100% stuck always sshing into a real os
[00:23:52] <lz_> I'll try 21h2 first, if it does the job then I don't need w11
[00:24:41] <BtbN> You'll need it in 1 year then, great
[00:25:44] <BtbN> An Win10 literally does not have WSLg, soo
[00:26:01] <Diablo-D3> I didnt expect wslg to work btw
[00:26:15] <Diablo-D3> yet it actually fucking does
[00:26:35] <Diablo-D3> what a fucking weird future we live in
[00:26:40] <lz_> BtbN: it says it does on docs.microsoft.com
[00:26:54] <Diablo-D3> first party support from microsoft to have an actually fucking working x server
[00:27:37] <BtbN> lz_, where?
[00:27:54] <lz_> I don't want to copy/paste because I have a copy operation running from a vm and it's using the clipboard
[00:28:02] <BtbN> https://github.com/microsoft/wslg literally states Windows 11 as requirement
[00:28:07] <lz_> I pasted it earlier 30mins ago
[00:28:21] <lz_> maybe it's not wslg but wsl2 has cuda support on 21h2
[00:28:27] <lz_> and I just need cuda support

[11:38:06] <JakeSays> bpmedley_: well, that's closer, but too many magic numbers for my taste
[11:38:31] <JakeSays> also i would flip the access()== logic to reduce nesting
[11:38:50] <JakeSays> i'd also do the same with the giant if/else
[11:38:58] <bpmedley_> JakeSays : I wasn't sure if I wanted the nesting or not.  Also, good point about the 4.

[11:39:10] <JakeSays> bpmedley_: and the 0 and the 2
[11:39:39] <bpmedley_> Makes sense
[11:40:56] <bpmedley_> JakeSays : You are talking about the if with the continue?
[11:41:56] <JakeSays> bpmedley_: ah. yes that's one of them. the else is useless.
[11:42:39] <bpmedley_> If you don't mind, would you put a link to the other one that is odd or useless?
[11:42:56] <bpmedley_> I should have removed the one with continue, in hindsight.
[11:43:44] <JakeSays> just a sec.
[11:47:46] <JakeSays> bpmedley_: why is this an exception? throw new ArgumentException($"Unsupported Contents Found: {line} - {line.Split(' ', StringSplitOptions.RemoveEmptyEntries | StringSplitOptions.TrimEntries).Length}")
[11:48:43] <bpmedley_> JakeSays : If that line is executed then there the file was of unknown structure.

[11:49:36] <JakeSays> bpmedley_: it's not an exceptional condition. it's valid logic
[11:49:45] <JakeSays> i mean it's a valid condition
[11:49:54] <bpmedley_> Yet, I have no idea what the file would look like..
[11:50:16] <JakeSays> well, can you get socket info from it?
[11:50:45] <bpmedley_> Dunno.  Do you have a running Linux machine with easy access?
[11:50:53] <JakeSays> i'm on one
[11:51:15] <JakeSays> but my point is, if you can't parse it, then it's not valid socket data, but it's not invalid data. so just ignore the line.
[11:51:43] <bpmedley_> cat /proc/net/tcp{,6}  <-- These are example files
[11:52:58] <JakeSays> bpmedley_: here's my take on it: https://gist.github.com/JakeSays/f9b39df5e37dffadb25f69bf6295d3f0
[11:53:32] <bpmedley_> _ => ("unknown", "format", "skip")   <-- That might work instead of the exception
[11:53:52] <JakeSays> is it worth showing anything?
[11:54:19] <JakeSays> the content of /proc/net/tcp{,6} is an excellent use case for regex's
[11:55:16] <bpmedley_> When  you say worth showing anything, are you saying that ("unknown", "format", "skip") need not be in the code at all?

[12:46:07] <JakeSays> i am not a fan of the "top level" shit in .net 6

[20:48:05] <MaNa2k> yup. they say the gpu is on pair with gtx 1070
[20:48:17] <MaNa2k> but smaller and cooler due to new tech
