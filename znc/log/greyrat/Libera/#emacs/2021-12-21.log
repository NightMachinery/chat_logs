[00:24:51] <Aurora_v_kosmose> catern: That bit about microkernels has one missing detail. RPC communication means you don't need to use a single golden language for everything.
[00:26:15] <catern> you don't need to use a single golden language to avoid RPC, there is such a thing as libraries
[00:26:16] <Aurora_v_kosmose> So that is, in fact, an advantage.
[00:26:46] <Aurora_v_kosmose> So, assuming you wrote your kernel is Rust or Java. How do I call it from CL?
[00:26:57] <Aurora_v_kosmose> (Ignore the part where Java is a horrible choice)
[00:27:26] <artefact> that's also true for monolithic kernels. you can write a kernel module in rust if you wanted (though, good luck merging it into mainline)

[00:31:15] <bpalmer> artefact: a pascal string is a sequence of 1 or more u8 values (effectively), where the first specifies the length.

[00:57:35] <rpav> yeah no
[00:58:08] <catern> rpav: hey, it's probably triggering the same kind of btree/rope operations under the hood! what's wrong with that?
[00:58:11] <rpav> the point is that with an edit tree, you can splice data _without copying or moving_ significant amounts of other data
[00:58:28] <catern> rpav: this doesn't copy/move data - it's specially optimized using those exact same techniques

[15:24:39] <josemotanet> Hello! I'm watching daviwil 's video on mu4e and I'm trying to set up. I'm noticing there has been a change in `mu` in the sense that there's now an init command. It only takes a single account though, as I've tried to init twice, one for each account I have. I'm not sure if `mu init --maildir=~/mail --my-address=personal@example.org --my-address=work@example.org` will do the trick when specifying
[15:24:41] <josemotanet> contexts within Emacs, does it?

[15:25:29] <josemotanet> To clarify: I ran mu init with a single address twice, then I ran mu init with both addresses once.
[15:25:29] <artefact> i don't understand the question
[15:26:06] <josemotanet> So my question would be: if I `mu init` with both addresses, does Emacs understand both contexts?

[20:46:24] <gnoo> yup, i wanted to use surf but it just crashes on the one website i use
[20:46:36] <bigjonny> C++ and its consequences have been a disaster for software. It has made writing code unfufilling, caused numerous footguns to be put in the hands of ordinary coders, and made us unable to reason about our own templates.
[20:47:22] <rpav> chromium is devoid of google phoning-home i think, or there is a fork that is, if that's your concern
[20:49:05] <gnoo> i think chrom{e,ium} will probably much more resource intensive than firefox. i wanted to use surf because it's much more minimalist, basically just webkit with a thin layer on top

[20:54:07] <rpav> like my main concern about tiny off-brand browsers is not staying on top of patches (and/or introducing their own vulnerabilities etc) but i guess if they at least use the OS package that should be mostly updated

[20:57:40] <bigjonny> i read a blog post from the palemoon author one time. it was talking about how you can't have security with dynamic libs because they change arbitrarily
[20:57:58] <bigjonny> so i think his approach was like pinned static versions
[20:58:04] <Bayes> dear e-friends, what are the best tool for spelling and ideally style checking?
[20:58:21] <bigjonny> Bayes: none because nobody will compile aspell for windows
[20:58:38] <gnoo> i think that's much worse in terms of security. dynamic libs can fix security bugs while still maintaining abi compatibility. 
[20:58:49] <Bayes> I'm running linux if that helps, bigjonny
[20:58:59] <bigjonny> yes but the argument is that other changes could introduce bugs
[20:59:00] <gnoo> flyspell-mode for spelling
[20:59:02] <bigjonny> at least as i understood it
[20:59:32] <rpav> bigjonny: seems dubious
[20:59:39] <bigjonny> i.e. you have a surface level "compatibility" like exported functions are the same. but some subtle change causes something to break somewhere
[21:00:09] <rpav> hypothetically, but the question is only really applicable practically
[21:00:13] <gnoo> the one using library should depend on how it's implemented but rather only that same input gives same output
[21:00:25] <bigjonny> i assume the palemoon author has some practical example that led to his beliving that
[21:00:26] <technomancy> lol, this confirms my (difficult) decision to stay away from plaemoon
[21:00:27] <gnoo> the rest is the job of the library to maintain
[21:00:33] <rpav> i would not assume such a thng
[21:00:34] <Bayes> gnoo yep flyspell-model is what I'm using, which I understand uses aspell or something like that ?
[21:01:02] <bigjonny> technomancy: is that like the "your terms are acceptable" meme? XD
[21:01:18] <gnoo> yeah, aspell, what problem are you facing, Bayes ?
[21:01:33] <rpav> though one practical example is ncurses, but that's more isolated to ncurses and the dist being a POS

[22:09:15] <TRS-80> From what I know about this so called vCard "standard" is that it's really not.  And with the implementation I am imagining, it should be easy to write customized importers / exporters for example export_vcard_2_0_android or whatever to handle whatever little nits may be specific to that.

[22:25:50] <TRS-80> I am also thinking the way to go is to eschew putting yourself in a position where you need to be at the mercy of $MEGACORP and instead make the Org Contacts file the primary source of truth, only exporting the minimal needed into a vCard for device support (mainly just to quick dial phone numbers).  But this is a paradigm shift for me, for many years I thought the goal was 2 way sync.

[22:46:06] <tsdh> TRS-80: Whereas for :annotation-function it is stated that the returned string is displayed next to the completion.
[22:46:16] <bpalmer> tsdh: it's not something in the released 27, but searching around, the prefix and suffix appear to be literally strings that will be prefixed and suffixed to the completion
