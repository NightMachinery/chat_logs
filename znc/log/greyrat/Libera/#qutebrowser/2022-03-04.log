[15:29:04] <SImatis> Devtools clearly shows the cookies per page, or anything else saved in local storage, like cached assets etc, so there is clearly a mechanism available.
[15:29:49] <SImatis> Maybe you could utilize that, to achieve the :sanitize command?
[15:32:56] <SImatis> under the application tab of devtools, you can click clear storage to delete: cookies, web sql, cached data, workers etc for the site

[18:08:32] <chrispickard[m]> is there any way to communicate with the host system that doesn't require spawning a new OS process? eg, is there a way to send a message to something running on the host system without shelling out to like netcat or something?
[18:09:13] <chrispickard[m]> spawning a new process has quite a bit of overhead I would like to avoid
[18:10:01] <The-Compiler> chrispickard[m]: wrong channel?
[18:10:49] <chrispickard[m]> nope. sorry, maybe I wasn't clear. I basically want `:spawn -u` but without having to launch a new OS process to run the userscript
[18:11:12] <chrispickard[m]> so I would have it running in the background, but the problem is how to communicate with it from qutebrowser
[18:12:34] <The-Compiler> chrispickard[m]: userscripts are separate processes, though you could have a long-running userscript and communicate with that in some way
[18:13:21] <The-Compiler> chrispickard[m]: also see https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser/issues/1741
[18:13:30] <chrispickard[m]> yeah that was my thinking, but is there a way to use like `:jseval` or something to make that happen?
[18:13:34] <chrispickard[m]> that's the part I'm struggling with
[18:17:11] <The-Compiler> nope (there's :debug-pyeval, but that's not a supported API in any way)
[18:17:50] <The-Compiler> maybe once there's an extension API
[18:17:56] <chrispickard[m]> ok, thanks
[18:17:58] <The-Compiler> can you describe what your end goal is?

[23:37:48] <The-Compiler> well, not officially, it just happens to work
[23:38:24] <The-Compiler> the idea is to slowly expand that into a supported extension API, the main roadblock (other than designing and implementing a good API) is doing proper error handling
[23:38:58] <The-Compiler> right now you just get the normal error reporter, and I do already get reports from people doing weird stuff in their config.py, so before making that more public, that problem needs to be solved
