[00:55:59] <piou> pyzozord: I think that more than simplicity go is about uniformity: since you have only one tool (to stay in the analogy) then you can take any part of the program and know what tool is used because that's the same tool that's used everywhere. It just ends up in a similar situation as old java which was a very simple language in that regard so people kept binding it backward to do everything
[00:56:05] <piou> leading to an overuse of design patterns. And suddenly the simple language had to use very complex structures that were not part of the language and were just conventions often designed for problems far more complex than the ones they were actually solving

[01:02:28] <piou> pyzozord: the interesting thing in this case is to recognize that the fact that people defaulted to these templates showed a need to have better default tools to handle complex problems, essentially building a language above the language.

[01:11:49] <piou> pyzozord: it's not exactly that, it's more "there is a minimum complexity required to solve any problem". If this weren't the case you could find a way to solve any problem without any work at all, the world just doesn't work that way. But there are ways that are more efficient than others of course. Looking for the simplest solution means looking for the one with the minimum complexity, not the
[01:11:55] <piou> one without complexity.

[01:14:16] <deniska> (well, not *that* simple if we're talking bonkers architectures like x86_64, but still, it's mostly mapping opcode names to opcode values/lengths/encodings, so mostly tabular data)
[01:14:29] <piou> pyzozord: striving to be manageable is a different goal IMHO, and most likely a better one. If go makes things more manageable for you then it certainly doesn't make the problem less complex, but you have a better chance of tackling that complexity
[01:14:48] <deniska> but for some reason people don't want simple assembly and prefer more complex high level languages instead :)
[01:14:55] <pyzozord> piou: agreed, then I think we are discussing now whether we've reached the inherent problem complexity yet or not, I believe we haven't yet and things can be simplified down more

[01:16:49] <sonny> phogg: "situation where you want to repeat a construct in a language" -- that's how I interpreted what you said
[01:17:04] <phogg> piou: It's hard to get simplicity without having a complex system that simulates it for you. It's simple *if* you can avoid looking under the hood.
[01:17:06] <piou> pyzozord: things like sorting data for example are well studied theoretically, you can shuffle the method arround, optimize some cases to the detriment of others, but the complexity is really what it is
[01:17:16] <phogg> sonny: that's not how I intended it
[01:17:34] <sonny> what is different though?
[01:17:53] <phogg> sonny: more like "if I  find I am designing a program that works *this way*, then I know that way of designing things has a name, and that name means I need to pay attention to *these things*"
[01:18:25] <piou> phogg: that's one way of being simple, and the way I prefer, but it's not the go way for example and it brings complexity in the variety of black boxes you have to learn to use compared to just having a for loop at your disposal and no box but everything to build
[01:18:26] <sonny> ah ... ok
[01:18:57] <sonny> when does something like a compiler or operating system not become a pattern? (being pedantic)
[01:20:08] <phogg> sonny: an OS might, from a certain point of view. You could say that Unix is a *design pattern* for OSes.
[01:21:10] <sonny> ok, I see what you mean
[01:21:11] <phogg> piou: both ways have their value, for sure. It's hard not to like the black boxes... it's hard to like the black boxes.
[01:22:11] <phogg> piou: in an ideal world you get both things: the high order abstraction to use most of the time *and* the ability to punch holes in it and ignore it when you want to.
[01:22:26] <piou> +1
[01:23:04] <phogg> the more I spend time doing this programming thing the more I believe that each software project is the art of designing a domain-specific language for expressing the solution to that program's problem domain
[01:23:11] <phogg> and then using that language to solve the problem
[01:23:14] <sonny> sounds lispy
[01:23:28] <phogg> to an extent, then, we are all building language infrastructure
[01:23:38] <phogg> sonny: lisp just makes the fact that you can do this more obvious
[01:23:41] <sonny> well, that is what a language should let you do

[01:25:37] <pyzozord> piou: one important technique of managing complexity is called "chunking". There is also idea in linguistics called "open class" which refers to a category of words in a language that can be created. I think that relates well to say functions and variables. There is also a closed class, which includes a class of words that are pretty much fixed, these are more like keywords in programming

[02:36:58] <piou> Hmm... Not many tbh. I like the approach of "Modern C" (https://hal.inria.fr/hal-02383654/document) but you also need a book to understand C the way it's commonly used. I like "Expert C programming" and "C Notes for Professionals" (https://books.goalkicker.com/CBook/CNotesForProfessionals.pdf) to get deep into the language. "C Programming: a Modern Approach" would probably a good general book

[02:39:29] <piou> The fundamental issue is: C is a very complex and difficult language. We know that. We developped ways to tackle that complexity in the form of new language features, standard libraries and conventions. But if people keep using books that predate all that to teach themselves the language then all that work is for nothing and we'll keep having stupid buffer overflows, use after free, etc.
[02:39:55] <sonny> It's just the language tbh
[02:40:05] <sonny> even the pros (open source commiters) do it
[02:40:12] <piou> Yes and no

[02:40:38] <piou> The language is a big part, it really shouldn't be used for most projects nowadays given the plethora of good safe languages there are
[02:40:59] <sonny> wirth has already made languages that could handle similar problems with less issues decades ago
[02:41:02] <piou> But on the other hand we made things a whole lot better for ourselves, but keep not teaching these ways to beginners
[02:41:22] <piou> if people are going to learn C, they should learn it the safe way
[02:41:39] <sonny> interesting, what way is that?
[02:41:50] <piou> it'll always be easier to shoot yourself in the foot than in other languages, but it should still be as hard as possible
[02:42:07] <piou> sonny: frankly, the most concise answer is "the way described in Modern C"
[02:42:20] <sonny> that text isn't beginner friendly though
[02:42:25] <piou> exactly
[02:42:42] <KillerWasp> sonny: the bug does not exist in the code of hello world. it's a fake notice in the blog.

[02:50:26] <KillerWasp> Although in the case of pipe it would be tools that were designed to work, in that case there could be other errors like a broken pipe. But that there is no space would only be forced from the outside and not by another program on the chain. Although the program would already tackle any error caused by sending information in the pipe.
[02:50:40] <sonny> ProfSimm: probably with invariants (assertions) ... but there isn't really tools that let me say, hmm did I dispose of memory properly or stuff like that
[02:51:44] <KillerWasp> normally you would directly use write() if you plan to pipe or stream the tool.

[04:58:21] <zzz> Gamah: it's mathematics, you can have anything you like
[04:59:42] <KillerWasp> I have also seen that to achieve greater precision in the PI, you have to do endlessly infinite calculations to weave the PI number longer and longer to infinity.

[05:51:50] <kinduff> okay i did it
[05:51:53] <kinduff> thank you all
[05:52:25] <apotheon> I wrote a Matrix widget yesterday.  That was an eye-opener.
[05:53:38] <apotheon> It was exactly like writing a JavaScript web application circa 2005 (or maybe earlier), including finding a place to host it, but with some CSS upgrades.
[05:54:26] <apotheon> . . . 'cause apparently Matrix widgets are just JavaScript applications on the web, but you register the URL with the Matrix channel where it'll be used.
[05:55:09] <apotheon> I also discovered that Matrix doesn't support bots in encrypted channels, for some reason.
[05:55:41] <flakland> how can they enforce that?
[05:55:48] *** Joins: wauterboi (~wauterboi@185.195.233.169)
[05:55:59] <apotheon> It may be a technical limitation for how they define bots.
[05:56:15] <apotheon> Otherwise, you can probably just write a Matrix client that runs itself.
[05:56:59] <apotheon> The latter strategy would be the equivalent of how IRC bots work, and I guess Matrix "bots" in the terminology it uses are different somehow.

[07:13:16] <arahael> amigojapan: It's only conceptually a "whole processor", but in practice significant parts of those conceptual processors are often shared between cores... Within a processor...

[07:36:54] <amigojapan> Windows was also a program
[07:37:02] <sonny> DOS was in windows 95? lol
[07:37:17] <amigojapan> Windows was in DOS
[07:37:23] <Decker> so was winnt - just used the bios boot directly instead of a DOS layer so it included more of its own disk drivers

[08:42:44] <oldlaptop> It's honestly probably not going to ever be particularly user-visible except to the kind of people who don't care about the "desktop wars". (i.e. those for whom wayland genuinely has feature gaps such that they don't want it)

[12:17:34] <circleguy> so I have like objects that I want to position randomly all over a space. Let's say in `{ x: Math.random() * range, y: Math.random() * range }` `range` is 1000. That means my objects will be placed in a random range from 0 to 1000. The objects will be placed rectangularly, however, like in a box

[13:42:15] <Decker> in 2D you get 1 - but it not in the space of the 2D plane... it's perpendicular and 'imaginary' to that plane
[13:42:48] <Decker> in 3 you get 3, and it looksl ike hte overlap axis... but the first is over the Z which is an axis that didn't previously exist, and the new rotaitons overlap X/Y but they're really NOT the x/y.

[13:43:03] <ski> pyzozord : well, there's simply zero planes to rotate in, in one dimensions
[13:43:05] <Decker> when you get to 4, you don't have an axis to overlap the 4th dimension... only the previous x/y/z axis
[13:43:16] <Decker> you can't even rotate around w :(
[13:43:17] <pyzozord> just dial doesn't represent rotation, it represent position in that dimension
[13:43:33] <Decker> that's more like GPS than COmpass :)
[13:43:55] <pyzozord> that's true, you'd need two dashboards one with your position and one with target position
[13:44:13] <pyzozord> and then that's going to be probably that n * (n-1) / 2

[13:47:15] *** Quits: Tempesta (~Tempesta@user/tempesta) (Quit: See ya!)
[13:47:34] <Decker> anyway after 4 it becomes really obvious all rotations are 'imaginary' ... ijklmnopq...
[13:48:07] <Decker> (err or rather tha axis are) even if they happen to overlap in 3D
[13:48:35] <ski> why broken ?
[13:49:27] <ski> it's just that there's no unique axis orthogonal to the plane that you can consider it as rotating around
[13:49:58] <ski> (but that's also true in two dimensions, as you noticed. it's really three dimensions that's the oddball here, having such a unique axis)
[13:50:25] <Decker> because if you rotate around W, it should move points in x/y/z to another x/y/z leaving the points along W the same... 
[13:51:11] <ski> .. but of course, not all rotations are rotations in a plane / circular rotations. there's also e.g. spherical (three dimensional) rotations (which you could express in terms of a sequence of two circular rotations in different planes, though not in such a nice way, sure)
[13:51:31] <Decker> but you can't even rotate around w - even when you get to 5th dimension which ; given the 'overlaps existing axis' idea which works for 3 and 4, but I think still fails for 5, but 5 would have an axis that overlapped W
[13:51:50] <Decker> but all rotation are rotations around a line.... 
[13:51:53] <ski> well, you can do a spherical rotation which leaves ⌜w⌝ fixed
[13:52:38] <ski> "but all rotation are rotations around a line...." -- nope

[13:58:39] <ski> in 4D, you get rotation around a plane (the plane spanned by two axes you're not rotating around, the lines/axes you're rotating around being orthogonal, so this is a double rotation), or around a line (so this is a (two-)spherical rotation, the line being the axis that's fixed), or around a point (a full 3-sphere rotation, changing all four coordinates (unless it's the zero rotation changing nothing))
[13:58:45] <ski> &c.
[13:59:57] <Decker> that's working from 2D planes, and assuming your axis has to be perpendicular to a plane rather than starting with a rotation axis, and rotating things perpendicular to the line

[14:03:30] <ski> anyway, thinking about an axis (or point, or plane) about which the rotation proceeds (leaving the axis/point/plane fixed) is secondary. primary is the ⌜n⌝-dimensional sphere which is rotating (in case ⌜n = 2⌝, this is an ordinary circular rotation, in case ⌜n = 3⌝, this is an ordinary spherical rotation, &c.). then if there are remaining directions/axes in the space (because there's more 
[14:03:36] <ski> dimensions), those will generate another subspace (being a point, a line, a plane, a 3D space, &c.) which is what's being fixed by the rotation

[15:09:05] <wildo> He did told me in the middle that I've to speak like a native.
[15:09:28] <wildo> But again I was really nervous and I do have native friends with whom I communicate fine.

[15:10:01] <pyzozord> yeah it's a bit off, generally looks like there is some invisible factor

[15:21:06] <user51> thanks.
[15:21:08] <Andrew> lol
[15:21:44] <pyzozord> wildo: what's the reason usually?
[15:21:47] <wildo> Recently a good company interveiwed me for an intermediate PHP role. I got quite suprised how these job things works.
[15:22:24] <PlanckWalk> I've never applied anywhere that has three or four rounds of interviews.
[15:22:25] <wildo> Experience, phone call, and most of them don't give me a feedback even though I can ask most of the time.

[15:23:23] <wildo> PlanckWalk: usually the first round is with HR - simple questions (don't know how this works either? I mean how you can judge a person or personality based on 10 - 15 minutes of interview)
[15:23:33] <wildo> and then second round goes with tecnical to do challenge
[15:24:03] <wildo> then comes phone interview with the tech lead or senior developer
[15:24:28] <wildo> if everything goes well then chat with the CEO or CTO, afte that you can join the company

[15:26:35] <wildo> I don't if I should say but the country I'm talking about is New Zealand
[15:26:47] <wildo> Most of the comapnies in here are small 
[15:26:55] <PlanckWalk> That's even more bizarre then.
[15:27:10] <wildo> PlanckWalk: Yeah and this has happened twice now four rounds of interview
[15:27:10] <pyzozord> wildo: entry level programming jobs got much more competetive
[15:27:36] <wildo> ^^it feels like they've lot to choose by hirgin entry level developers
[15:27:53] <wildo> most of the jobs that gets listed in this country are of intermediate or senior devs
[15:28:14] <wildo> also most of the junior devs. falls upon C# and .NET
[15:28:36] <wildo> which leads me to only a handful of companies doing PHP and JS stack
[15:28:59] <wildo> I wouldn't considered myself a strong JS developer as I recently started building web app. on React 
[15:29:39] <wildo> My stack is or the languages that I'm familiar with are C, Java, Python, PHP, Vanilla JS, Bash.
[15:29:55] <pyzozord> it might be that you are not a native speaker in a native speaking country
[15:31:02] <pyzozord> there might be a bias
[15:31:07] <wildo> what do you mean? I did a six month internship and I did fine, and I was able to finish my masters.
[15:31:10] <pyzozord> try finding a remote job from another country
[15:32:02] <pyzozord> I mean maybe they just bias to a native speaker with all other things being equal
[15:32:24] <wildo> pyzozord: that remind me of I've a good native friend and it's same with him
[15:32:34] <pyzozord> not sure never really had experience with new zealand culture
[15:32:45] <wildo> he recently got internship because some guy recommended him
[15:32:53] <pyzozord> oh ok well that would exclude that option then
[15:33:11] <wildo> basically in New Zealand if someone can give you a reference then you're good to go

[15:38:50] <Decker> davros 'location' should be available - seems like a useful thing to have in the wasm machine... (from window.location) which is a parsed URL (from URL() )
[15:38:52] <davros> but i want to connect to a custom application that will be on the same server
[15:39:39] <davros> yeah it seems like the browser should know what it is, but an additional concern here is "is it accessible from a program compiled with emscripten"
[15:39:55] <davros> 'location' , is that in the DOM or something

[19:49:05] <Amadiro_> InPhase, the more rigorous answer is that your question is ill-posed unless you give a more specific system of axioms to ask the question in. In standard mathematics, the question cannot be asked in a valid way; you can only inquire about the limits (e.g. lim_{x->0} (c/x)/(c^2/x) = ?). There are other systems like the real projective line which include infinity or +infinity and -infinity as numbers, but they also cannot necessarily answer this 
[19:49:05] <Amadiro_> question
[19:49:21] <KillerWasp> infinity is a number, like i (complex number) also is a number.
[19:49:55] <Amadiro_> InPhase, in terms of cardinality there's no distinction between the infinities produced by either expression, so standard mathematics wouldn't really have an answer for you as to "which one is bigger" in any commonly defined meaning of the question
[19:49:57] <InPhase> Amadiro_: Yeah, I'm aware.  :)  It is only askable under the stated premise of assigning it a value in the first place.
[19:50:23] <InPhase> Amadiro_: At which point comparisons must become possible, and it all falls apart, leading eventually to standard math.
[19:50:27] <pulse> KillerWasp, it's not, because you can't operate on it like you can with numbers
[19:50:58] <pulse> KillerWasp, infinity+1 is still infinity, it makes no sense
[19:51:09] <pulse> KillerWasp, furthermore, the number line is *not* an interval from 0..infinity
[19:51:12] <InPhase> Amadiro_: But alas, KillerWasp did not bite on the question and follow through the steps.
[19:51:14] <pulse> if it were, we could count to infinity
[19:51:17] <pulse> or subtract from it

[19:51:52] <KillerWasp> The fact that infinity is as real as matter itself and the universe, what is unreal is antimatter or fantastic matter (or supermatter). The veracity of scientists is only reduced more and more until they are old men rambling nonsense. Why should I believe that infinity is not a number? What stupidity.

[19:53:14] <pyzozord> I think a lot of my philosophy of software engineering is informed by Casey/Jon
[19:53:56] <InPhase> It grounds in a very physical sense the problems with trying to assign a quantity to infinity in any sense of the word quantity.
[19:54:23] <KillerWasp> pulse: you can substract: inf-1
[19:54:34] <pulse> KillerWasp, no, you can't

[19:54:49] <InPhase> Infinity is a thing approachable, not a thing reachable.  Things that approach infinity can approach it in different functional forms, scales, and so on.  But that's as close as it gets to a value.
[19:54:55] <pulse> which makes even inf-inf undefinable

[19:58:34] <KillerWasp> you must account in the mind that inf is a number for check and corroborate that's a exact math
[19:59:18] <KillerWasp> 0 are in the middle of inf's. between inf and -inf.
[19:59:27] <KillerWasp> also, inf are in the middle of 0 and -0.

[19:59:39] <Gamah> it is not mappable to the scale of real numbers

[20:27:07] <KillerWasp> If we tried to leave the planet earth to travel beyond the galaxy, we would find that all the galaxies that we saw in space would disappear and we would see a single galaxy, and we would run into the limit of the universe that would not allow us to leave it due to the attraction of the black hole in which we are locked.

[20:55:55] <justanotheruser> "...I decided therefore to use the word "programming". I wanted to get across the idea that this was dynamic, this was multistage, this was time-varying. I thought, let's kill two birds with one stone. Let's take a word that has an absolutely precise meaning, namely dynamic, in the classical physical sense. It also has a very interesting property as an adjective, and that is it's impossible
[20:55:56] <justanotheruser> to use the word dynamic in a pejorative sense. Try thinking of some combination that will possibly give it a pejorative meaning. It's impossible. Thus, I thought dynamic programming was a good name. It was something not even a Congressman could object to. So I used it as an umbrella for my activities." — Richard Bellman, Eye of the Hurricane: An Autobiography (1984, page 159)

[21:11:05] <pyzozord> yeah some extra optimizations might be there since you can probably make some assumptions basde on the "in this segment" vs "in other segment"
[21:11:16] <bjs> pyzozord: I was imagining prefetchers and the like
[21:11:35] <okNo> In Java, if we have the following line c.m1(), where c is defined to have static type C, is it always possible to know statically (i.e at compile time) the exact method that would be executed at run time?  (The answer is in fact no, but I'd like an expansion on why it is no; doesn't the static keyword mean yes?)
[21:11:53] <pyzozord> cppreference.com is good I should have a local copy
[21:11:56] <GeDaMo> x86 has short, near and far jmps
[21:12:23] <GeDaMo> With far, you also have to supply the segment
[21:12:33] <bjs> far is absolute, so you give it an actual address
[21:12:35] <GeDaMo> Those aren't used in normal code any more
[21:12:39] <sonny> okNo: what line?
[21:12:50] <pyzozord> far jumps are not used in normal code anymore?
[21:12:51] <yawkat> okNo: what do you mean by "static type"
[21:13:06] <okNo> I thought static type meant *static keyword*, but I'm guessing it actually means abstract type?
[21:13:34] <yawkat> "static type" means "the type of the lhs expression as known at compile time", which i dont think is what you mean
[21:13:52] <okNo> The professor who wrote this question, when I asked why it's false, responded that: "All we know is that the static type of c is C, we don’t know its dynamic type. The dynamic type determines what method is actually called at run time. At compile time, the compiler only knows the static type of c. The compiler will check to make sure that there
[21:13:53] <okNo> is a method m1 defined in C at compile time, but this does not mean this method is the one called. At run type, dynamic dispatch may be used to figure out which method to run."

[21:14:04] <okNo> But this would make me think that means they meant to write abstract type, instead of static
[21:14:17] <yawkat> no, static type is correct here. static type has nothing to do with the static key word
[21:14:36] <sonny> sounds like this is about generics?

[21:16:04] <GeDaMo> pyzozord: segments aren't really a thing anymore, so use of a far jump is unusual
[21:17:10] <bjs> okNo: if the professor is asking about just normal classes and methods. like `void foo(Object x) { ... }` for example, then you don't know just by looking at foo what class `x` will actually be an instance of at runtime, as the method accepts many different types (in this case for `Object`, almost all of them).
[21:17:38] <bjs> it's hard to know what the professor means just from that small snippet, did they not give some code to explain?
