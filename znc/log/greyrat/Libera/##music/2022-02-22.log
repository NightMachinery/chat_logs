[00:00:33] <piercedwater> new tube came today
[00:00:40] <piercedwater> i have them labeled :|
[00:01:07] <R2robot> neat
[00:01:12] <R2robot> WHat's it... 'do'?
[00:01:25] <piercedwater> makes the amp sound different than the stock tube
[00:01:29] <R2robot> I have no experience with tubes that don't go inside guitar amps
[00:01:45] <piercedwater> what else do you play?
[00:01:58] <R2robot> just guitar
[00:02:06] <piercedwater> cool. what kind?
[00:02:12] <R2robot> technically I also have a banjo
[00:02:17] <piercedwater> :D
[00:02:18] <R2robot> but I stink at it
[00:02:42] <R2robot> my guitar is an Agile.. Korean made Les Paul knockoff.
[00:02:42] <piercedwater> is the banjo electric?
[00:02:49] <R2robot> Best guitar i've ever owned. lol
[00:02:59] <R2robot> no, regular tawngy banjo
[00:03:19] <piercedwater> i don't play any more, but i've been thinking of buying some intrument(s)....for fun, ya know?
[00:03:36] <R2robot> yeah
[00:03:53] <R2robot> I haven't been playing either.. I want to start again.  Guitar is in storage.. need to get it soon

[00:04:11] <piercedwater> niiice
[00:04:21] <piercedwater> what does the sticker say?
[00:04:27] <R2robot> I changed the tubs in that amp to be more 'crunchy' at a lower volume.
[00:04:30] <R2robot> tubes*
[00:04:35] <R2robot> Blackheart
[00:04:40] <piercedwater> ah
[00:05:00] <R2robot> it was a 'boutique' amp company.. owned by Crate I think.. but I think they've gone out of business
[00:05:49] <R2robot> so i know some tubes make good dirty/crunchy sounds.. which is probably not desirable in record player amps. lol
[00:05:59] <R2robot> which is why I was wondering what yours did :D
[00:06:01] <piercedwater> lol idk
[00:06:15] <piercedwater> i've never owned any other kind of amp than for my music listening
[00:06:20] <piercedwater> but it makes sense, yeah
[00:06:31] <R2robot> ahh
[00:06:38] <R2robot> I love how tube amps are... LOUD
[00:06:49] <R2robot> like.. really really loud compared to digital amps i've had
[00:06:49] <piercedwater> the sound difference is there when I want/need it. which I like
[00:07:07] <piercedwater> yerp. i like the natural, warm sound they produce :D
[00:07:19] <MusicalDillo> tube distortion is 'soft'
[00:07:21] <R2robot> yeah..  I had another set of tubes that were a bit.. warmer and a little less harsh crunch
[00:07:49] <piercedwater> tubes are so cool \o/
[00:07:53] <R2robot> I wish I had some recordings of the crunch from this amp
[00:07:57] <R2robot> it's pleasant
[00:07:59] <MusicalDillo> there are plug-ins that emulate classic tube rigs
[00:08:13] <piercedwater> Dillo: for WinAmp, etc.?
[00:08:23] <MusicalDillo> for DAWs
[00:08:32] <R2robot> MusicalDillo: I had a digitech RP-500 with some amp modeling.
[00:08:36] <piercedwater> ah cool
[00:09:03] <R2robot> Line6 and Boss makes some nice ones for guitar as well.  I want one of those

[00:09:44] <R2robot> this blackheart amp is only 5 watts.  3 if you flip the splitter..  Thing will make you go deaf and shake the walls
[00:10:04] <MusicalDillo> "One thing we love about these guitar plug-ins at Sweetwater is how useful they are beyond just guitars — many of these are great solutions for bass too, and their outstanding effects are also sweet on vocals and other instruments."
[00:10:05] <piercedwater> woohoo
[00:10:08] <R2robot> 10x louder than the 15 watt digital amp I used to have. lol
[00:10:19] <piercedwater> \o/

[00:10:36] <piercedwater> Dilo: do you play?

[00:18:41] <MusicalDillo> and all the rack stuff I have is much easier to deal with
[00:18:45] <piercedwater> i gotta ask: do you have your own area or room or something just for creating? I ask b/c when I played I needed quite a bit of space to be creative
[00:19:00] <MusicalDillo> plus you've got the librarian features for all your patches
[00:19:26] <MusicalDillo> Yeah, I carved out a piece of the living room for a workstation area

[03:19:58] <TomatoSynth> occasionally this hellsite has some gold: https://www.reddit.com/r/synthesizers/comments/sx33g1/so_i_placed_a_craigslist_ad_for_a_synth_jam_this/
[03:19:59] <Janet> /r/synthesizers :: So I placed a Craigslist ad for a synth jam. This guy came over yesterday. Said he had some old synth. Imagine my surprise when he shows up with this! :: 860 points (98%) :: 58 comments :: Posted yesterday by Roodillon :: https://i.redd.it/ktr83d9860j81.jpg (i.redd.it)
[03:20:04] <piercedwater> ah yeah, i hear ya :/
[03:20:32] <sublim20> i don't want to be inhaling the metal,  though i think the new disposable ones dont do it as much, who knows
[03:20:42] <sublim20> i switched to nicotine pouches, and those things are amazing
[03:20:57] * MusicalDillo wonders if a TomatoSynth is anything like Stevie Wonder hooking up his ARP 2600 to plants for voltage control for the album The Secret Life Of Plants
[03:21:05] <sublim20> tasty, discrete, and can be done anywhere
[03:21:32] <TomatoSynth> MusicalDillo, lolll
[03:21:40] <TomatoSynth> i'll admit when someone has my number
[03:21:51] <TomatoSynth> i love plants, synths, ritual magick; you got me there
[03:21:52] <sublim20> oh jenny, i got your number
[03:21:55] <piercedwater> oh coo. i've never tried the pouches. are they cheaper than cigs?
[03:22:01] <sublim20> here in ny, hell yeaaaa
[03:22:07] <piercedwater> nice!
[03:22:14] <sublim20> pack of smokes here is now like 11~12 bucks
[03:22:27] <R2robot> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uw6_-x1t8PM
[03:22:30] <Janet> ^ Pulp Fiction Soundtrack-Surf Rider - YouTube
[03:22:33] <sublim20> that's literally 8-9 bucks of just straight tax
[03:23:06] <sublim20> while the pouches are, well, cause they're newer, all over the map
[03:23:18] <sublim20> they SHOULD cost 3-4 bucks, but some places charge 9 bucks
[03:23:35] <sublim20> there's this one 7-11 that sells them for 3-4 bucks though
[03:24:02] <piercedwater> ugh
[03:24:11] <sublim20> they USED to sell them for like 1.50, due to a mess up in the computer.  but the fucking old ass, former crack whore worker, found out, and stopped selling them and alerted the owner
[03:24:20] <sublim20> fucking bitch
[03:24:20] <piercedwater> $10/pack here for my favs, although I usually vape. $20 for a 60mL bottle or something. lasts 10 days
[03:24:31] <sublim20> do they allow for flavors 
[03:24:35] <piercedwater> yeah
[03:24:37] <sublim20> they banned flavors here in ny
[03:24:40] <piercedwater> Geek Vapor brother
[03:24:41] <piercedwater> oh
[03:24:46] <piercedwater> jfc
[03:24:52] <sublim20> yea
[03:24:58] <sublim20> people are now smuggling vape juice
[03:25:01] <sublim20> its absurd
[03:25:02] <piercedwater> i read awhile back NY banned large sodas too
[03:25:13] <sublim20> did they ban it, or just heavily tax it
[03:25:17] <sublim20> and i think that was only in nyc
[03:25:20] <piercedwater> i seem to remember a ban
[03:25:22] <piercedwater> ah ok
[03:25:28] <piercedwater> either way, you're right. ABTURD
[03:25:30] <R2robot> I remember that too
[03:25:42] <sublim20> the soda sizes are absurd
[03:25:46] <R2robot> yeah
[03:25:51] <sublim20> a 'small' is what used to be a large
[03:25:57] <piercedwater> true, good point
[03:26:06] <piercedwater> kids drink is now 32oz lmao
[03:26:07] <piercedwater> jk
[03:26:10] <sublim20> lol
[03:26:19] <sublim20> mexico plumped up
[03:26:22] <R2robot> I like how this one australian guys I used to follow freaked out when he'd come to the US.   our small is their large apparently. lol
[03:26:24] <piercedwater> :x
[03:26:32] <sublim20> think their obesity rates are higher than the u.s. now
[03:26:33] <piercedwater> ah damn robot
[03:26:52] <piercedwater> i'd freak out if i was raised somewhere outside the U.S. as well
[03:27:43] <R2robot> the aussie girl traveling with him was like W T F .. when the food she ordered arrived.   She was like.. this is for at LEAST 3 people! lol
[03:27:51] <piercedwater> :D
[03:28:05] <piercedwater> not to mention grocery prices are fucking insane
[03:28:08] <R2robot> we've lost all sense of normality when it comes to food
[03:28:10] <piercedwater> at least here

[03:28:31] <morf> aha aha

[03:28:44] <piercedwater> lolol
[03:28:48] <sublim20> the only ones not gouging, is costco
[03:28:55] <sublim20> costco is love
[03:29:10] <piercedwater> don't they sell a bit of everything? i've never been in one that i can recall
[03:29:55] <sublim20> costco is a big store, that generally sells food.  you pay a membership to shop there, like 60 bucks a year, but everything is sold in bulk
[03:30:12] <sublim20> honestly though, the yearly cost is offset by the savings pretty quickly
[03:30:15] <piercedwater> oh ok. I've heard of Sam's. sounds similar
[03:30:24] <sublim20> sams is the walmart version of costco
[03:30:28] <piercedwater> gotcha
[03:30:37] <sublim20> costcos hysterical
[03:30:42] <piercedwater> lol why
[03:30:45] <sublim20> they refuse to raise the price on their hotdog meal
[03:30:50] <piercedwater> :D
[03:30:51] <sublim20> hotdog and a coke, for 1.50 since forever
[03:31:04] <piercedwater> mmm
[03:31:10] <sublim20> i think they lose money on it now, and they still refure to budge, cause its something their known for
[03:31:22] <piercedwater> good for them
[03:31:26] <piercedwater> not being sheeple
[03:31:46] <sublim20> the pizza at costco, is ok though.  not great, not terrible, just ok
[03:31:56] <piercedwater> i like Whole Foods' pizza
[03:32:00] <piercedwater> so greasy mmm
[03:32:04] <sublim20> unless its some holiday and their working on a skeleton crew, then you can get some fucked up shit

[14:05:43] <artao> you get 5 tries per puzzle, and it ends if you fail one. BUT of course shows you the answer so you can figure out why
[14:06:03] <artao> and with each try the points you get go down, til you get zero on the 5th try ... but can at least keep going
[14:06:37] <artao> and it's "intelligent" in that if you feed it a database of your own games, it'll see what you need work on and give you puzzles like that
[14:06:49] <artao> the puzzles are from databases of varying skill levels of real games
[14:07:12] <artao> for awhile it was giving me a lot of fork puzzles. now i'm MUCH better -- and faster -- at seeing them

[17:14:55] <macrobat> you can have a wealth of sounds on an electric cello, but this instance (in the theme) has a weak and poor sound. maybe it can also be because of the very fast notes. you don't want them to be smeared
