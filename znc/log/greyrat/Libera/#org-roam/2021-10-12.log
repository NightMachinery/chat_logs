[11:53:38] <Carp> is there a way to search for nodes/files by tags? at the moment all my permanent notes and fleeting notes are jumbled together so i was wondering if there's a way to search for nodes/files by tags... say a fleeting tag to display only all the fleeting notes, or permanent tag for all the permanent notes, etc?
[11:54:52] <zaeph> It's something that is on the map, but I don't think it's implemented, yet.  We're still thinking/designing the UX, but since most of my time has been accounted for lately, I haven't been able to get to it.
[11:59:03] <Carp> ah ok. i'm new to roam so was just wondering if such functionality is possible. :P
[12:00:11] <zaeph> Anything is possible in Emacs; you just have to find time for the maints. :o)
[12:04:07] <Carp> haha ya that's what i heard. i'm new to emacs in general. still reading the manual :D it's been fun though
[12:04:47] <zaeph> Best of luck on your journey. :)
[12:15:27] <Carp> thank you sir! :>
