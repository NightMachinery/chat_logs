[00:09:36] <bjs> teut: no,  the text section contains the code.
[00:09:45] <bjs> teut: the stack contains local variables.
[00:10:02] <teut> yes , that much is repeated above three times
[00:10:47] <teut> new info I received today =      a stack is actually a (stack frame, stack frame, stack frame, ...)
[00:11:05] <teut> data = global vars
[00:11:14] <oldlaptop> teut: and not one of those stack frames (generally) contains any "instructions".
[00:11:34] <teut> then what do they contain?
[00:11:48] <oldlaptop> (I won't say there doesn't exist a programming environment somewhere that pushes function bodies onto some kind of "stack" along with local variables and other stuff, but it wouldn't generally make sense.)
[00:11:54] <oldlaptop> <bjs> teut: the stack contains local variables.
[00:12:12] <teut> and what about the LOAD, ADD, etc
[00:12:31] <bjs> teut: those are code, they're in text
[00:13:02] <teut> we have already compiled the code and have a binary with bytes now
[00:13:16] <teut> so there is no code now
[00:13:28] <bjs> teut: if you have a function like `void f(int x, int y) { int z = x + y; ... }` the ADD is in the "text" section, and when you call "f" then {x,y,z} will be pushed to the stack
[00:13:30] <teut> LOAD =   some bytecode
[00:13:32] <oldlaptop> Usually that's all stored somewhere else. In most general-purpose computers it's a different region of memory, but it could also be a completely different memory. (C supports Harvard-style machines with completely separate memories, one to store code and one to store data, for example; many microcontrollers, such as the AVR and PIC families, are such machines.)
[00:13:34] <GeDaMo> oldlaptop: machine code on the stack suggests a buffer overflow attack :P
[00:13:42] <teut> x56 maybe
[00:13:48] <bjs> teut: no, no bytecode.  actual machine code here.  but all of these words contain the word "code", they're all code.
[00:14:00] <teut> yes that is what I m saying bytecode
[00:14:00] <bjs> teut: the compiled code (the machine code) gets put into the bit of memory called "text"
[00:14:08] <bjs> teut: it's not bytecode, it's machine code (for C).
[00:14:16] <teut> yes but its bytes
[00:14:38] <oldlaptop> "bytecode" usually refers to the code that some kind of fake machine, such as the JVM, executes, not to the code that the "real" machine executes.
[00:14:49] <teut> the assembler  replaces  LOAD    by   some  "word" in binary
[00:14:58] <teut> yes oldlaptop
[00:14:59] <GeDaMo> 'bytecode' usually refers to an intermediate form used by interpreters

[00:18:07] <WarauSalesman> yeah! you are off meds
[00:18:12] <bjs> teut: when you compile a C program, you get an object file (e.g. some file.o).  When the OS wants to run the file for example, it'll have to load it into memory, it'll dump the actual machine code bytes in a part called "text", it'll make a space called "stack", and a space called "heap" and it'll put the program's global variables in a place called "data".
[00:18:36] <bjs> teut: then the OS will say "CPU, jump to 'text' and run the program" and then it'll run

[00:19:09] <teut> thats what I said before,  some bytes are put onto the stack from the "text"
[00:19:12] <bjs> teut: each function call will "push" an array onto the stack, with slots for each local variable (a "frame") and when it's done, it will pop it off.  The code that does this is inside the machine code which is in "text"
[00:19:30] *** Joins: Akuli (~Akuli@213.216.211.211)
[00:19:54] <teut> yes, so we are reading the  "text" and putting those bytes onto the stack
[00:19:57] <bjs> and that code will read and write to memory locations inside "stack" (for reading/writing local variables in the function), to "heap" (to read/write to malloc()d things) and to "data" [or "bss"] (to read/write global variables)
[00:20:01] <bjs> teut: no
[00:20:11] <bjs> teut: stack contains local variables, text contains code.
[00:20:17] <oldlaptop> The code in the "text" section stays there. It doesn't get copied or moved anywhere else.
[00:20:17] <teut> reading, ie loading onto the stack
[00:20:20] <bjs> teut: there is never code in "stack"
[00:20:30] <bjs> teut: no the bytes in text will never be put anywhere near "stack"
[00:21:22] <bjs> teut: you are usually not even _allowed_ to read or write to "text". That's just the blob of machine code that the CPU is executing,  you can't see it or touch it (unlike stack/heap/data) but it has to exist because the CPU executes programs that are in memory and it has to go somewhere in memory
[00:21:28] <teut> the text should contain  bytes corresponding to  LOAD eax   78  ;    ADD  #r1  #r2 #r3
[00:21:30] <teut> etc
[00:21:35] <oldlaptop> The CPU does "read" the code in order to execute it, but that's a very different operation from what is usually meant by the term "read".

[00:22:51] <oldlaptop> And although the "text" section is just a different area in memory for your desktop computer, there are millions (billions?) of embedded computers (microcontrollers) built in to things that have completely different memory systems for code and data.
[00:22:59] <teut>   x45  x78  x78  x67 x56  x89         text
[00:23:13] <bjs> teut: my "int z = x + y" will have something like "LOAD x; LOAD y; ADD; STORE z" and that code will be in the "text" section, but "x" and "y" and "z" will be memory addresses in "stack"
[00:23:45] <teut> LOAD x; LOAD y; ADD; STORE z    , isnt the assembled  code  in the text?
[00:24:01] <teut> oh oh , ok

[00:29:37] <teut> yes I know this, bjs told about this yesterday or so

[00:30:36] <oldlaptop> Most real computers have "memory" and "registers"; instructions work with operands that are stored in registers, or in locations in memory. A "register" is one of a handful (or at most a few dozen) special locations that can hold the operand to a single instruction.

[00:31:31] <teut> now I get it, actually I was relating to  this pushdown machine the whole time, sorry
[00:32:03] <GeDaMo> There have been physical implementations of stack machines
[00:32:11] <oldlaptop> It's also possible to have a "stack machine", where the operands to instructions are pushed onto the stack, and the instruction tells them to pop some operands off. Most "stack machines" are virtual machines, and the JVM is a notable one.

[00:33:51] <teut> 2 stacks?
[00:33:58] <GeDaMo> The CPU reads the instruction from memory at IP, executes it then advances the IP to the next instruction and repeats
[00:34:13] * oldlaptop casts back in memory: <oldlaptop> "Stack" is unfortunately a word with lots of more or less unrelated meanings. You might be better off not using it while you're trying to understand this.

[00:34:33] <bjs> teut: when you run C there is only 1 thing called a "stack".

[00:36:03] <oldlaptop> When you're thinking about the "runtime stack" that "stack frames" get pushed onto when you call functions, you need to completely forget about the "stack" your JVM book is talking about, they are completely unrelated things.

[01:18:39] <jraskar> Pessoal, estou matriculado em um curso de data science que me fez uma pergunta, que é: "quantos dentifrícios se vendem por mês no meu país". Querem saber mais sobre a lógica que irei seguir para resolver isso, alguma ajuda? Não consegui encontrar nenhum dado sobre isso em sites do governo, como o site de impostos. Já tenho uma linha de raciocínio, mas gostaria de outras visões sobre o caso
[01:18:48] <jraskar> Guys, I'm enrolled in a data science course that asked me a question, which is: "how many toothpastes are sold per month in my country". They want to know more about the logic that I will follow to solve it, any help? I couldn't find any data about it on government websites such as tax website. I already have a line of reasoning, but I would like other views on the case

[01:20:32] <creek> nice
[01:20:44] <eyynet4> they're going to make you go down to the store and count toothpaste sales!?
[01:21:13] <creek> tell them your answer is 1000 and it came from IRC

[01:23:00] <teut> actually you can pick any object whose price is similar to toothpaste

[01:27:11] <entuland> yep, the line of reasoning / research seems the point
[01:27:31] <eyynet4> maybe some toothpaste company is a major donor to this school and wants market research done for them

[01:41:37] <jraskar> oldlaptop: i can see how much taxes was collected in my country per month, i would take that, see the average price of toothpastes and calculate the taxes with this value... then I would make a hypothetical calculation of how many toothpastes are consumed by the population of the country, separating the social classes (eg, poor people consuming 1 or no toothpaste, rich people always buying, and middle class buying frequently). Then another
[01:41:38] <jraskar> hypothetical calculation of how much toothpaste is consumed by each person in the month, and try to filter a value that would relate the amount paid in fees with the amount consumed per person following these filters

[01:42:52] <oldlaptop> That sounds like it's probably on the right track to me. A question: can you assume that tax collections and toothpaste sales are related very strongly?
[01:43:08] <jraskar> it would all be very "hypothetical", but the logic would be valid if you got some real values ​​provided by some government website or something like that
[01:43:19] <oldlaptop> For example my jurisdiction exempts most food products from sales taxes.
[01:44:28] <oldlaptop> Are you sure you're looking at the most useful sources? Maybe there are parties that would know more about things like toothpaste sales than the government.
[01:44:34] <oldlaptop> (Or care more about them.)
[01:44:49] <jraskar> i can not assume real numbers in fact because i do not have the quantity of how much is saled, but i could calculated a base value of how much was collect in taxes, and filter by the number that i could get with the filter using the amount of toothpaste that one person can consume in a month
[01:45:53] <eyynet4> one person might bruch more often, or use more toothpaste than needed
[01:45:54] <jraskar> i tried to search for it on other sources too, but got nothing
[01:46:19] <eyynet4> brush teeth more often*
[01:46:43] <oldlaptop> I'm still not imagining you'd find something on toothpaste sales, specifically. But maybe you can find something that you can draw better inferences from than tax data.
[01:46:50] <jraskar> yes... its a lot of variables, like i said, i think that they do not care about real numbers, but the logic that could achieve such a question answered

[01:47:17] <oldlaptop> Part of that logic is minimizing those 'variables', or making sure you pick good ones. :)
[01:48:04] <jraskar> ill try to search for sales about the most popular toothpastes, maybe it would be easier to filter 3 or 4 brands that could spare this data

[11:12:40] <beaky> what are some clever uses of dependent types beyond the infamous length-indexed vector
[11:14:19] <beaky> or the not-as-infamous height-indexed tree
[11:14:25] <eyynet4> depends on length being uncorrupted value?
[11:14:34] <beaky> what is an uncorrupted value
[11:14:51] <eyynet4> what des it mean to be a dependent type
[11:16:08] <beaky> dependent types let you have types that have a value index so usually lists where the elements are of type A has the type List A but if you have dependent types you can also have a length-indexed list where the empty list has type List A 0, and the nonempty list has type List A (suc n)

[11:27:27] <beaky> a stack is a value not a type, but the stack could have a dependent type, just like the length-indexed vector, so operations like pop could have type Π n -> Stack A (suc n) -> (A, Stack A n) so it only accepts nonempty stacks for instance (and thus avoid the problem of stack underflow)

[16:04:53] <DPA> If you want to trigger some action from the gui / call a function has to be called. You usually don't want the logic / code to depend on the UI details, so usually either the UI references the function,
[16:04:54] <DPA> or an event is sent and the code calls a function when the event occurs, or there is a UI controller for handling UI stuff which then calls the real function when the UI action is performed.

[16:25:58] <gitesh> how functions are not related to events at all?
[16:26:58] <DPA> An event is just some kind of signaling / notification. There still needs to be code to react to it and change the program state. And some code somewhere must have created the event in the first place, but thats often abstracted away in some library or framework.
[16:26:58] <DPA> Some microcontrollers map certain things to memory though, such as the state of pins, to which a switch or other things may be connected. So on those, the hardware can change the a state directly, without any code.

[18:42:24] <pulse> yeah. grapes kinda come close too
[18:42:33] <pulse> you could argue grapes and blueberries are blue

[18:44:22] <sandman13> grapes look dark purple or black IMO
[18:44:38] <sandman13> But you are right. I haven't seen blue fruit
[18:44:40] <pulse> there's a specimen of grapes that looks kinda blue
[18:45:18] <pulse> but it's just light purple really
[18:45:56] <piou> there's also the question of what you name blue... Ancient greeks made no difference between green and blue, it was all shades of a single color, and to this day many different culture perceive colour boundaries very differently from the western seven colors of the rainbow (and most western people don't even agree that there are seven colours in the rainbow)
[18:46:21] <piou> So maybe it really was blue for the people that named them blueberry

[18:54:29] <pulse> yeah i can see that
[18:54:40] <pulse> blue and green are right next to eachother in the spectrum

For example, a website with only text and images will generally not be interactive: you can receive information but can't change the behaviour of the website in any way. On the other hand something like google maps is interractive, you act on it (click somewhere), it changes (zooms), etc. You're
[19:13:29] <piou> not just consuming static information, you're providing information as you go and receiving a response.

I've been reading about it wherever I can find but I'm still wondering if it is something you can implement a new (non existant) function on your code. For exmaple, suppose there is a class with a private variable but no getter or setter. Can mockImplementation be used to create a getter outside the class that works to access the variable in the
[22:27:12] <blahboybaz> actual class?

[22:48:19] *** Joins: elnavigator (~elnavigat@105.196.28.153)
[22:48:39] <InPhase> I would say read the wikipedia article, get the conceptual level down, then find a library in a language you like which does multithreading well, and find an event-based message passing library, go through the documentation, and give it a whirl with a toy problem.
[22:49:04] <InPhase> Nothing will give you a solid grasp like doing it.
[22:51:36] <InPhase> There are many takes on the syntax arrangement for this, but usually there are basic common principles at work involving connecting signals/messages to event handlers that run on the designated thread of the recipient, or sometimes in a thread pool.
[22:52:02] *** Joins: DevAntoine (~DevAntoin@78.196.234.32)
[22:53:07] <InPhase> I personally find dedicated threads most useful most of the time, as they let you break down synchronization with clean thread boundaries, and you can assign thread ownership to data.  Thread pools have more limited uses, and impose higher requirements for interface boundaries and not sharing most data across other things also running in the pool.
[22:53:48] <InPhase> It's important to consider early in the process, as some event libraries out there only do one or the other, or focus more on one than the other.

[22:55:28] <InPhase> You can also in principle do non-multithreaded event driven programming, but this is of very limited utility.  Usually this would just be for a very simple gui where every response to an interface action is guaranteed very fast.

[23:33:37] <pyzozord> oh ok, then I don't know. I'd probably assume log2 as well
[23:33:53] <blahboybaz> If I'm not mistaken, since javascript is a prototypical language there is a way to write classes (not using the class keyword) that use the prototype keyword - right?

[23:36:07] <blahboybaz> So using that way to write a class (where the prototype keyword is employed) you could add a function to the class function later in a separate file (the added function in a separate file to the class funtion).

[23:37:07] <pyzozord> blahboybaz: there is no keyword "prototype" in javascript. But there is a special myobject.prototype property
[23:37:21] <W> Izem, & and && (or = and ==) both being valid constructs in a language, with different meaning
[23:37:40] <pyzozord> blahboybaz: yes, it's very meta, very dynamic. You can add and remove properties to anything any time you want
[23:37:50] <W> usually even just a /slightly/ different meaning, like this & and && mistake
[23:37:55] <blahboybaz> What I'm gettitng at is there should be a way to jest mock where it is creating a new method and adding it to an actual class (not a mock but the real class) where you aren't overwriting an existing method in the class but creating a brand new one i9sn
[23:37:59] <blahboybaz> isn't there?

[23:40:26] <Izem> I always say equals when I see =, even though I know it is assignment

[23:40:52] <Izem> using something else is a good idea, tho I like thompsons rationale :)
[23:40:58] <W> (and that & is an operator on integers)
[23:41:22] <Izem> I was agreeing with you
[23:42:37] <blahboybaz> pyzozord: myobject.mockfn = jest.mock() is automocking the entire object right? I thought that makes everything return undefined.

[23:43:55] <W> gets rids of a whole swathe of other annoying "clever" code too, like multiplying a boolean by the difference you would have applied in a numeric expression
[23:44:27] <Izem> yeah, let the compiler be clever instead :P
[23:44:42] <GeDaMo> You could have an explicit conversion to int if it's necessary
[23:44:57] <blahboybaz> I need to track calls to a private variable (#head) because it is used throughout most of my methods in the class. The examples I've seem so far involve really different use cases for me to apply to my situation.
[23:44:59] <pyzozord> blahboybaz: oh sorry I meant myobject.mockfn = jest.fn()
[23:45:01] <GeDaMo> int(a > b)
[23:45:11] <Izem> hmm, yeah that's a good idea
[23:45:50] <Izem> if I made a language, a boolean would just be a symbol.
[23:46:02] <blahboybaz> pyzozord: Nevertheless I thought the result of that returns undefined to everyythign that was mocked. Also I didn't think it includes private fields in the mock

[23:50:43] <blahboybaz> pyzozord:  #head is a field in my class that points to the head of the list. Half the methods in the class make extensive use of it. I would like to test the interactions with that variable in a number of ways (eg: that it gets called, that it gets assigned, what it get's assigned with, etc). But the actual field, and the actual assignments and interactions
[23:51:20] <blahboybaz> If that's a bad practice then there will be a massive (and integral part of) coverage that I won't be able to address
[23:51:21] <pyzozord> blahboybaz: if you need to test your private functions I think the easiest (and best) way to do it is to redesign your class such that testing is easy. This happens a lot, unit tests will force you to redesign your system to be more modular, usually that's a good thing
[23:51:46] <Izem> sure, many languages have booleans, but they are not symbols. However they are represented internally doesn't matter
[23:52:01] <blahboybaz> It isn't a function it's a field - if it was a function I could probably use spyOn but as a field I can't find out the right approach
[23:52:26] <DALEK-SEC> aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa but forever.
[23:52:47] <user51> Izem: i never thougth of a bool symbol. how would it look like?

[23:53:24] <GeDaMo> user51: True or False, T or F
[23:53:39] <blahboybaz> My reaosning for making it a privaate field and not having a getter / setter is that there is no need for that field to be accessed or modified from outside the class. Making it private and not including a getter / setter hardens the class a little
[23:54:04] <user51> ah, for some raeson i thought it would be an operator, or maybe some latin symbol
[23:54:08] <Izem> user51: a symbol is a special element of a programming language just in case context is lost

[23:55:39] <Izem> although, knuth has shown me that sometimes it can be beneficial to have booleans and numbers be well related :P
[23:55:51] <user51> GeDaMo: any advantages over the c-style one?
[23:56:32] <Izem> not much, just consistency
[23:56:38] <GeDaMo> What's the C-style one?
[23:56:52] <user51> 0 is false, !0 is true
[23:57:16] <GeDaMo> That's what the conversation has been about :P
[23:57:18] <Izem> some languages generalize that concept anyways
[23:58:07] <Izem> yeah see above, for the & and && mistake
[23:58:38] <Izem> that would be an error in say, Java
[23:59:33] <user51> my instinct says that bools could be a subset of numbers, but i have no idea what you want to do with your language, maybe you've got a good case
