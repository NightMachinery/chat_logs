[00:49:30] <Teckla> Any OneDrive users here?  Wondering if it's reasonable to store *large* .git files on OneDrive, and if OneDrive is smart enough to sync file deltas, rather than entire files.
[00:52:02] <ben> i can't imagine putting git repos in a synced dir like onedrive/googledrive/dropbox etc would work very well at all

[00:54:50] <pe> That's actually irrelevant.
[00:57:18] <Teckla> Based on some quick Googling, it seems changing even 1 byte in a large file, will cause OneDrive to re-sync the entire file, not just the 1 byte  :(
[00:57:21] <Teckla> Oh well, so much for that idea, heh

[13:09:04] <pe> And parser combinators are cool.
[13:09:44] <pe> I managed to write an HTTP parser in C++ by more or less copy pasting the EBNF from its RFC.

[13:47:49] <grgz> I'm curious about the actual parser, http's syntax is regular, so in theory a finite-state machine ought to be enough, you don't really need a grammar. Can you dig in the bowels of the parser and see if it's using a stack somewhere?
[13:53:06] <pe> It's mine. I use the C++ stack as a stack.
[13:53:27] <pe> Really straight-forward to write.
[13:55:59] <pe> That's why it's cool.
[13:56:10] <pe> The downside is that it's also very slow.
[13:56:53] <pe> Compared to a pre-compiled solution that doesn't chase pointers.
[13:57:16] <grgz> you don't need the stack though
[13:59:07] <pe> I don't think it can be omitted.
[14:00:06] <pe> My intuition says it would be infinitely large.
[14:01:47] *** Joins: cdown (~cdown@188.214.11.14)
[14:02:18] <pe> Right, you talk about HTTP in particular.
[14:02:52] <grgz> in the grammar I don't see any recursive rules, so it can be collapsed down to a regular expression, and those only need a finite memory. In this case there's maybe one character lookahead, so only one char of memory is needed. What could grow infinitely is of course the representation.
[14:04:00] <pe> And you don't need a stack to recognize it.
[14:04:13] <pe> But still need a stack to actually parse it.
[14:04:30] <pe> Or some other kind of data structure.
[14:05:35] <grgz> I suppose you have an http request struct somewhere with a method, a url, and a map(-like DS) with key-value being headers. Your parser starts with an empty struct and builds it as it is parsing, without a stack

[21:42:23] <jackalope00> Why do people use BSD on laptops?  It seems like a lot more work than Linux for no clear advantage.
[21:42:49] <technomancy> with freebsd you can play audio without pulse

[21:43:28] <pe> That's also true on Linux.
[21:44:08] <pe> PulseAudio is reliable, if you don't want to use Bluetooth.
[21:44:42] <pe> And output switching is generally painful.
[21:44:42] <technomancy> I don't use BSD but that's the one thing I'm jealous of BSD users for
[21:46:17] <pe> More importantly, PipeWire has little to do with PulseAudio.
