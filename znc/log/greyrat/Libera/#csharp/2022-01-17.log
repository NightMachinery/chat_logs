[11:23:07] <JakeSays> yup
[11:23:08] <Nasp> I also considered if i could use some Noctua 40mm i think mines smaller if i remember correctly
[11:23:14] <tsujp> I do want to know this though: is there a validation attribute I can create that will validate the associated property is unique within a list of those objects?
[11:23:24] <MatthiasVance> JakeSays: Automatic bed leveling is *chefs kiss* though
[11:23:33] <Nasp> tsujp:  I would recommend fluent validation
[11:23:41] <Nasp> I wish i had bad leveling :D
[11:23:42] <JakeSays> MatthiasVance: what firmware are you using for bltouch?
[11:23:51] <MatthiasVance> The Creality one
[11:23:57] <tsujp> So class `Foo` has property `string Name` on it, and I add this attribute `[UniqueWithinCollection]` and then it validates that a `List<Foo>` has no objects with the same `Name`?
[11:23:57] <JakeSays> right, but which one
[11:24:35] <MatthiasVance> JakeSays: 26 Mar, 2021  Ender-3 V2-Marlin-2.0.1-HW-4.2.2-mainboard-V1.1.2-Compatible with BLTouch and filament detection.zip
[11:24:38] <tsujp> No cannot use FluentValidation, this either needs to be an Attribute or implemented via IValidateableObject
[11:26:01] <JakeSays> MatthiasVance: but that's for a 4.2.2 controller
[11:26:11] <MatthiasVance> I have a 4.2.2 currently, but there's also a 4.2.7 version
[11:26:24] <Nasp> tsujp:  Why can't you use that
[11:26:33] <Nasp> Attributes aren't a good for logic
[11:26:42] <tsujp> No new dependencies allowed
[11:26:55] <JakeSays> MatthiasVance: ah right you ordered the board upgrade
[11:26:59] <Nasp> Ohh right one of those places
[11:27:06] <MatthiasVance> JakeSays: Yeah will take 2 weeks or something to arrive at local supplier
[11:27:08] <Nasp> I believe you may have mentioned this before
[11:27:21] <MatthiasVance> JakeSays: I figured as long as stock firmware works .. not going to fiddle with it
[11:27:40] <JakeSays> MatthiasVance: i tried for three days to get that exact firmware to work with my ender 3v2. fially gave up
[11:27:49] <MatthiasVance> Did you get a black screen?
[11:28:01] <MatthiasVance> Because that scared me for a few minutes :P
[11:28:17] <JakeSays> i tried so many combinations i don't remember
[11:28:31] <MatthiasVance> What helped was fully cleaning (I formatted) the SD card, pulling the plug of the machine before doing it and naming the file "firmware<number>.bin"
[11:28:41] <MatthiasVance> Some combination of that worked (I did everything at the same time)
[11:28:42] <MatthiasVance> :D
[11:28:46] <MatthiasVance> Before that, all black screens
[11:29:10] <JakeSays> yeah. i tried all of that as well
[11:30:12] <JakeSays> i'm going to upgrade the controller just to get rid of the squealing steppers
[11:30:46] <MatthiasVance> Also some people have mentioned that you need to upgrade the LCD firmware *first*
[11:30:53] <MatthiasVance> There's a separate SD card slot on the LCD screen
[11:30:54] <Nasp> One more down with corona
[11:31:18] <MatthiasVance> I am so glad I don't work in an office anymore
[11:31:43] <MatthiasVance> Also because some people just get too close and those are often the same people that think the risk is low and come to the office when sneezing and whatnot

[11:34:21] <JakeSays> MatthiasVance: yeah that's another huge issue. i ended up replacing the extruder
[11:35:03] <MatthiasVance> Have you ever done prints longer than 8 hours?
[11:35:16] <JakeSays> yes
[11:35:18] <JakeSays> several
[11:35:28] <MatthiasVance> There's this huge rock snake thing (Onyx from Pokemon) that apparently takes 23 hours or something.. I can only imagine that failing for me after 20 hours
[11:35:51] <JakeSays> ohh it's fucking annoying
[11:37:02] <JakeSays> MatthiasVance: https://pasteboard.co/MJtRRj7ZMdSR.jpg - that's what i had to do to the extruder to get it to work
[11:37:32] <MatthiasVance> What I can see is that the initial hole is bigger?
[11:37:37] <MatthiasVance> Or both are?
[11:37:59] <JakeSays> the extruder is made out of aluminum
[11:38:16] <JakeSays> and the holes are positioned better

[11:39:25] <MatthiasVance> Ahhh wow yeah I see now
[11:39:55] <MatthiasVance> I did that (the angle) but bending it worked best
[11:40:00] <JakeSays> shit like that i shouldn't have to do
[11:40:16] <MatthiasVance> I love how not everything is totally straightforward but you can improve things yourself because those machines are relatively simple
[11:40:29] <MaNa2k> good morning
[11:41:01] <MatthiasVance> JakeSays: Every connector on my board is glued a bit so during sensor upgrade I figured to leave that end and just disconnect the z-stop sensor. However .. I need to upgrade the board later lol
[11:41:19] <MatthiasVance> The little sharp plier? that came with it did wonders though
[11:42:15] <JakeSays> i would've preferred they stick the pliers up their asses and make a printer that works out of the box
[11:43:32] <MatthiasVance> So you figured .. let's recommend it to MatthiasVance so we can share the pain?
[11:43:34] <MatthiasVance> :P
[11:43:55] <JakeSays> MatthiasVance: LOL problem is they're all like this
[11:44:08] <MatthiasVance> Just kidding, I got that after I dove a little deeper on the topic of 3D printers
[11:44:08] <MaNa2k> just wondering, why the fuck are we actually using core and .net6 anyhow, its slow and sucks balls when debugging. .net framework wasnt really that bad
[11:44:22] <JakeSays> overall the ender 3 is a decent printer once you get past the pain
[11:44:22] <MatthiasVance> MaNa2k: lol?
[11:44:48] <MatthiasVance> I am just happy my setting up was great, less happy about the bed scratch because I fucked up, but it's not a deep one so should be fine
[11:44:54] <MaNa2k> i feel like core and .net6 is too heavy, got lots of owerheads
[11:44:54] <JakeSays> MaNa2k: what alternate dimension are you in?
[11:45:01] <MatthiasVance> lol MaNa2k wtf :D
[11:45:12] <MatthiasVance> What is happening here
[11:45:17] <JakeSays> MatthiasVance: what do you use for bed adhesion?
[11:45:19] <MatthiasVance> I know you're serious so I wonder .. WHAT?!
[11:45:24] <MatthiasVance> JakeSays: Nothing
[11:45:30] <MaNa2k> MatthiasVance, try compiling the same project in .net6\core vs framework, and you see that we are in same dimension :P
[11:45:48] <MatthiasVance> I don't like it when someone is in my house damn it
[11:45:58] <MatthiasVance> MaNa2k: I dropped .NET framework years ago
[11:46:11] <MaNa2k> me too
[11:46:17] <MaNa2k> but i feel like its too sluggish
[11:46:26] <MaNa2k> the core and .net6
[11:46:31] <MatthiasVance> How?
[11:46:51] <MatthiasVance> JakeSays: Mind you I only printed the supplied cat-3.5h and dog-2h and a benchy twice
[11:46:54] <JakeSays> MaNa2k: the core and .net 6 are the same thing
[11:46:58] <MaNa2k> ex. when debugging stuff, it steps too slow
[11:47:05] <MatthiasVance> MaNa2k: No issues with that
[11:47:14] <JakeSays> MaNa2k: yeah. no issue here either
[11:47:22] <MaNa2k> MatthiasVance, especially in function apps
[11:47:43] <JakeSays> whats a function app
[11:47:51] <MaNa2k> when you have been in debug-mode for very long, have steped lots of times back and forth, then it tends to get laggy
[11:48:15] <JakeSays> MaNa2k: that's more of an issue with vs
[11:48:34] <MaNa2k> JakeSays, how do you do it then ?
[11:48:38] <MatthiasVance> Why are you debugging function apps for a very long time
[11:48:47] <MatthiasVance> Just switch to F# and make sure you have working code *before* you deploy ;P
[11:48:50] <JakeSays> what the hell is a function app
[11:48:52] <MaNa2k> MatthiasVance, because its a actually a long running process
[11:48:54] <MatthiasVance> Azure Function, JakeSays
[11:48:57] <JakeSays> ah
[11:49:04] <MatthiasVance> MaNa2k: Yeah but why debug it? Is there something wrong?
[11:49:23] <JakeSays> MaNa2k: there are many other things that could be causing debug sluggishness than just .net
[11:49:26] <MaNa2k> MatthiasVance, well one normally debugs their app while coding right ?
[11:49:30] <MatthiasVance> NO
[11:49:35] <MatthiasVance> Why would I need to do that?
[11:49:41] <MatthiasVance> There are no bugs, why would I need to de-bug
[11:49:44] <MaNa2k> MatthiasVance, so you dont test your code
[11:49:45] <JakeSays> MatthiasVance: you don't step through your code?
[11:49:49] <MaNa2k> lol
[11:49:50] <MatthiasVance> Testing is different from debugging!
[11:50:22] <MatthiasVance> JakeSays: Only if something unexpected happens that I don't want to write a test for
[11:50:27] <MatthiasVance> JakeSays: Which is hopefully not that often
[11:50:41] <JakeSays> i step through everything
[11:50:44] <MaNa2k> MatthiasVance, well when i run through the code, and it dosnt work, normally i set a breakpoint to the point it crashed, then try to figure out why by checking the variables in different vars
[11:50:56] <MatthiasVance> In our production application I hardly ever need to debug
[11:51:20] <JakeSays> i have to see my code run
[11:51:25] <MaNa2k> MatthiasVance, JakeSays well i bet you guys are using pipeline, we arnt
[11:51:37] <JakeSays> MaNa2k: i'm not using azure anything
[11:51:49] <MaNa2k> JakeSays, oh i see. aws ?
[11:52:01] <JakeSays> MaNa2k: not everything exists in the cloud
[11:52:02] <MatthiasVance> To be fair I had to debug a lot more when I was using C# primarily
[11:52:06] <MaNa2k> JakeSays, then how\where do you deploy your aps
[11:52:50] <JakeSays> MaNa2k: well that all depends on the app
[11:53:25] <MaNa2k> MatthiasVance, what are you on now? f# ?
[11:53:39] <MaNa2k> well i have no idea how F# works
[11:53:48] <MatthiasVance> All apps from our team are F# yes and run distributed
[11:54:03] <JakeSays> MatthiasVance: you poisoned your whole team?

[11:54:35] <MaNa2k> *hanging around
[11:54:47] <MatthiasVance> Why wouldn't I?
[11:55:11] <JakeSays> MaNa2k: because he has no life
[11:56:17] <MaNa2k> anyway, i feel like framework was king of working perfectly, then came core, and lots of things started to become wierd
[11:56:19] <MatthiasVance> I have so much time now that I use F# .. ;p

[11:57:20] <MatthiasVance> MaNa2k: Did you do a full switch (including knowledge) from .NET FW to .NET 6 or did you gradually do it over the years?
[11:57:30] <MaNa2k> MatthiasVance, isnt F# for big data ?
[11:57:32] <Nasp> I've been wanting to set that up, since i imagine that would be so helpful when a print fail, so it's easier to spot, when and how it failed
[11:57:33] <MatthiasVance> Nasp: Not yet but will buy one for the printer
[11:57:36] <MaNa2k> or scientific stuff
[11:57:38] <MatthiasVance> MaNa2k: F# is for the same things you use C# for
[11:58:16] <MaNa2k> MatthiasVance, well we did a sudden switch
[11:58:34] <Nasp> MaNa2k:  Why do you feel core and .NET 5+ is slow and heavy?
[11:58:48] <MaNa2k> MatthiasVance, we let old projects run in framwork, then migreted some critical to core and let some old be on an old server
[11:59:02] <MatthiasVance> Yes but did you already play around with .NET Core/6 before that?
[11:59:08] <MaNa2k> nope
[11:59:18] <MatthiasVance> Ahhh then I totally understand, now *everything* new to you
[11:59:27] <MaNa2k> we thuoght its probably pretty much the same, man we were wrong
[11:59:44] <MatthiasVance> Also, do research before you upgrade a few major versions? xD
[12:00:05] <jmer> What!? research?...
[12:00:07] <JakeSays> MatthiasVance: are you going to set up octoprint?
[12:00:12] <MaNa2k> MatthiasVance, actually, we also did a switch to azure at the same time we did a switch to core
[12:00:35] <MaNa2k> we were using a windows server before
[12:00:36] <MatthiasVance> JakeSays: Yes! I ordered the last rbpi 4 available (to me) in this country
[12:00:38] <JakeSays> MaNa2k: dude.. that's like having multiple organ transplants at the same time
[12:00:49] <MaNa2k> lol
[12:00:50] <MatthiasVance> JakeSays: It was the 2GB RAM model, but that should be plenty I guess?
[12:01:06] <JakeSays> MatthiasVance: you don't need to use a pi. anything will work. i use a jetson nano
[12:01:19] <MaNa2k> but i must say the old framework apps rarely fail
[12:01:28] <MaNa2k> compared to the .net6\core apps
[12:01:34] <jmer> MaNa2k: that's BS xD
[12:02:00] <MaNa2k> ms just made shit more complicated with azure + core
[12:02:11] <jmer> Not really
[12:02:13] <MatthiasVance> I think your team just fucked up migration?
[12:02:19] <MatthiasVance> And lack of knowledge == more errors
[12:02:20] <jmer> I agree with MatthiasVance on this
[12:02:23] <MaNa2k> wheat ms actually did was dump all the networking guys work onto developers
[12:02:26] <MaNa2k> *what
[12:02:27] <JakeSays> MaNa2k: ms just made things more complicated period. it's what they do.
[12:03:12] <MatthiasVance> MaNa2k: So you say "we did no research" and then you say "everything is more complicated now" and "we have more errors"
[12:03:19] <MatthiasVance> That is a logical result
[12:03:49] <MaNa2k> MatthiasVance, well we did do some research, and came to conclusion it was easy to migrate, but later found out different
[12:03:51] <MatthiasVance> JakeSays: Well yeah but I am already familiar with Pi.
[12:04:02] <MatthiasVance> MaNa2k: Yes but you weren't up to speed with what it meant which is the same
[12:04:07] <JakeSays> linux is linux
[12:04:16] <MaNa2k> mhm
[12:04:18] <MaNa2k> probably not
[12:04:33] <MatthiasVance> JakeSays: Oh yes, I wanted to go the safe route
[12:04:47] <JakeSays> MatthiasVance: what safe route
[12:05:12] <MatthiasVance> I read somewhere that a pi would work so I ordered one :P
[12:05:22] <MatthiasVance> Didn't look further because I wanted to get it before all the things were sold out
[12:05:34] <Nasp> MatthiasVance:  good luck with that :D
[12:05:41] <JakeSays> everyone thinks pi because of octopi, which is just raspbian with octoprint pre-installed
[12:05:43] <Nasp> I only have a date where it might be back in stock now
[12:06:07] <Nasp> I would argue a raspberry is the safest route as well
[12:06:41] <MatthiasVance> Not safest as in "this is the only thing that works" but rather "this is the only thing I know so far"
[12:07:17] <MatthiasVance> Nasp: I can't even buy one for you.. 1 per customer :D
[12:07:25] <MatthiasVance> I might be able to buy one on my personal account though
[12:08:27] <Nasp> I was also a douche and just ordered 4 from that place that couldn't confirm a date and only have an "possible stock date"
[12:08:29] <JakeSays> octoprint is just a python app. the pi is nothing special
[12:08:59] <MatthiasVance> JakeSays: Agreed!
[12:09:45] <MaNa2k> whats up with pi anyway, why do people buy em like crazy ?
[12:10:01] <JakeSays> MaNa2k: the ecosystem
[12:10:03] <MaNa2k> yes i know you can practically run windows on it, but its slow as shit
[12:10:21] <MaNa2k> JakeSays, what you mean by ecosystem ?
[12:10:29] <Nasp> JakeSays:  But most like the raspberry because it's tried and tested
[12:10:30] <MaNa2k> whatever you run on pi will be slow
[12:10:37] <Nasp> Instead of some of the lesser known devices
[12:10:49] <JakeSays> MaNa2k: that's not true.
[12:10:54] <JakeSays> Nasp: what?
[12:10:57] <Nasp> I dont think you buy a pi for speed
[12:10:58] <Inge> MaNa2k: there is so much stuff you can do with it - compatibility is excellent. Which is not the case for other and more powerful SBC's
[12:11:07] <Nasp> JakeSays:  Like compared to some rock pi, or other brands i've never heard of
[12:11:11] <Nasp> I would prefer buying a pi
[12:11:22] <MaNa2k> Nasp, JakeSays for what purpose ?
[12:11:28] <JakeSays> Nasp: why are you telling me this
[12:11:35] <MaNa2k> and why not arduino ?
[12:11:40] <Nasp> Wasn't that your argument that "Why buy a pi"
[12:11:51] <JakeSays> MaNa2k: a pi is many times more powerful than an arduino
[12:12:16] <JakeSays> Nasp: no, my argument as "it's no safer/better than anything else for running octoprint"
[12:12:18] <Nasp> Arduino is more of a micro controller isn't it
[12:12:19] <JakeSays> *was
[12:12:23] <JakeSays>  Nasp yes
[12:12:35] <JakeSays> MaNa2k: i use pi's for many things
[12:12:36] <Nasp> Like two totally different usecases
[12:12:41] <JakeSays> yup
[12:13:05] <JakeSays> i even have pi's controlling arduinos
[12:13:10] <Nasp> :D
[12:14:04] <JakeSays> i'm about to have a nano controlling an arduino
[12:14:14] <MaNa2k> so are you doing rpi servers ?
[12:14:31] <JakeSays> MaNa2k: some of them are.
[12:14:43] <JakeSays> one is a znc server
[12:15:31] <MaNa2k> hmm
[12:15:50] <JakeSays> another one is part of a KVM switch
[12:17:37] <MatthiasVance> I love that now if I need *something*, I can just fucking print it myself!
[12:17:50] <MatthiasVance> Let me print some virus DNA for you
[12:18:33] <JakeSays> MatthiasVance: i needed a C clamp to use while gluing something so i printed one.
[12:19:40] <Nasp> Or save a roundtrip to Ikea due to some plastic thing break or missing :D
[12:19:54] <Nasp> I like those manufacturers that just embrace it
[12:20:28] <JakeSays> Nasp: embrace what?
[12:20:51] <Nasp> 3D printing, as in provide schematics or blueprints for making your own designs
[12:20:59] <Nasp> Like so you don't need to measure stuff
[12:21:02] <JakeSays> who does that?
[12:21:13] <Nasp> Was it Roccat that did it for their mouse
[12:21:24] <Nasp> So you could print your own buttons / layout
[12:21:38] <JakeSays> that's cool
[12:22:19] <Nasp> IT's rather old actually, but still cool
[12:22:44] <Nasp> but it's not common place yet, but i've seen some manufactuers atleast providing 3d files of their products so it's easier for you to customize it

[15:04:54] <MatthiasVance> What happens if I don't?
[15:04:58] <canton7> tsujp, if you want to *test* whether the value is a List<string>, rather than asserting that it is, you can one-liner it with 'dict.TryGetValue("NAMES", out object value) && value is List<string> listOfNames'
[15:05:11] <tsujp> it seems canton7 that `value` is the enumerator not the list

[15:19:47] <biberu> WillPittenger: and there's the new alias too, which just makes it harder for people to recreate, ideally it should run and demonstrate the issue as is

[19:10:04] <_genuser_> DI question: Can you have 3 objects that take a single interface, but should be given separate implementations. Can you configure your DI to say when ObjectA requires ISomeInterface give it SomeImplementationA and so on for ObjectB when it requires ISomeInterface give it SomeImplementationB
[19:11:17] <MatthiasVance> MaNa2k: Totally agree
[19:11:45] <MatthiasVance> _genuser_: Named registration
[19:11:51] <MatthiasVance> _genuser_: Also what's the use case?
[19:14:03] <_genuser_> MatthiasVance let me look up named registration. Usecase: There's a IDataSorter. Then there's ByDateSorter, ByNameSorter, etc. They all get injected IDataSorter at creation. But the implementation is specific, so the sort happens based on specific criteria.
[19:14:04] *** Joins: Booster2ooo (~Booster2o@user/booster2ooo)

[19:17:39] <_genuser_> There's IDataSorter, and ByDateSorter, ByNameSorter, which implement this IDataSorter. Then there's a ViewGenerator, which takes an IDataSorter to sort and create a view.
[19:17:44] <_genuser_> MatthiasVance ^
[19:23:54] <xb0o2> _genuser_: Which container are you using? Almost all of them will allow you to register a factory method to control which IDataSorter is provided when instantiating certain services.
[19:30:03] <xb0o2> Something along the lines of `services.Register<SorterA>(); services.Register<SorterB>(); services.Register<ISorter, SorterA>(); services.Register<ThingThatNeedsSorterB>(s => new ThingThatNeedsSorterB(s.Resolve<SorterB>()));`
[19:30:24] <MatthiasVance> xb0o2: Yeah exactly that :)

[21:46:24] <MatthiasVance> By law, probably never if it wasn't required to escape?
[21:46:24] <sysRPL> i sure felt like killing him for real
[21:46:35] <MatthiasVance> sysRPL: Sorry man :(
[21:46:53] <MatthiasVance> sysRPL: I can't even begin to understand how that must have felt.
[21:47:06] <MatthiasVance> sysRPL: However, please make sure this person is not allowed anywhere near you?
[21:48:05] <sysRPL> i bet under the right circumstances if someone killed their tortured, even if the torturer was clearly no longer a threat the law wouldn't charge the person being tortured with killing their torturer
[21:48:36] <sysRPL> i wonder if there are any cases where this has happened and is documented somewhere
[21:58:47] <MatthiasVance> TIL "Easy USB" exists.. for USB-A etc
[21:58:58] <MatthiasVance> You can plug it in either way and it works

[22:46:06] <JakeSays> MatthiasVance: i use something called "bed weld"
[22:46:21] <JakeSays> some people use elmer's stick glue in the purple tube

[22:47:08] <MatthiasVance> Awh

[22:48:20] <JakeSays> MatthiasVance: no
[22:48:35] <MatthiasVance> Is that fine? It curls up and I see that the side of the nozzle has some residue still
[22:48:38] <JakeSays> MatthiasVance: it's just pre-extrusion
[22:48:55] <MatthiasVance> It doesn't always get rid of it during the first lines on the bed before printing
[22:49:00] <MatthiasVance> And then it fucks up the print
[22:49:16] <JakeSays> you can remove it and it'll just come back
[22:49:36] <JakeSays> just watch the print at the start
[22:50:29] <Nasp> JakeSays: mine just sticks so well without
[22:50:40] <Nasp> I think glue would make it stick worse
[22:50:48] <MatthiasVance> Nasp: Do you have a glass bed?
[22:51:02] <Nasp> MatthiasVance:  Btw did you pay for that Tado open window detection?
[22:51:08] <Nasp> MatthiasVance:  No
[22:51:10] <JakeSays> Nasp: i don't get consistent enough results with just alcohol
[22:51:17] <MatthiasVance> I pay for "a subscription" I'm assuming that includes it ;)
[22:51:35] <JakeSays> open window detection?
[22:52:00] <Nasp> I'm not really fan of that 5/10 euro a month for a thermostat to do what it should do to begin with
[22:52:25] <Nasp> MatthiasVance:  Mine's an ultrabase that when heated up is extra grippy
[22:52:33] <Nasp> I have to wait for things to cool down before i can get it off the bed
[22:53:57] <MatthiasVance> Same
[22:54:11] <MatthiasVance> Also heated to 60C, I think z-offset wasn't good enough
[22:54:18] <MatthiasVance> I had to lower it by 0.02mm ... shit what a distance
[22:54:29] <MatthiasVance> So not even 1/5th of a mm, no... 1/50th of a mm
[22:58:17] <MatthiasVance> Hm no that didn't fix it
[22:58:21] <MatthiasVance> Pretty sure z-offset is fine
[23:00:23] <MatthiasVance> Might be the new material

[23:39:50] <wroathe> Hey guys, so I've got a set of Powershell cmdlets I've written in C# that I'm just now learning about the ins and outs of CancellationToken with. The API for this involves overriding the methods BeginProcessing and StopProcessing for every cmdlet to do some basic setup and teardown (such as creating a new cancellation token source, and then calling cancel on it when the cmdlet is ready to exit).
[23:39:56] <wroathe> Inheritance is always a huge pain in the ass, and I see that C# 8.0 and .Net Core let you use interfaces with default implementations and initializers, but unfortunately I'm still on .NET Framework for this. What would be my best option for implementing "mixins" for something like this.
[23:40:08] <wroathe> If I had the default implementation interfaces available to me I'd try and make this something like ICancellableCmdlet
[23:42:43] <wroathe> And if I wanted to have other roles that do the same thing then I'd potentially be clobbering method definitions there
[23:42:57] <wroathe> For example, ILoggableCmdlet, which also needs to do setup and teardown
[23:48:36] <Telgareith> how do I prevent an asp.net application from spinning up if I detect a prereq (in this case all web.config keys are present) isn't met? My google fu is failing me

[23:54:20] <Telgareith> yes sir Suchi
[23:54:43] <Suchiman> Telgareith: if you throw an exception in Global_asax application_startup or something then that kills the app IIRC (it will then restart but not effectively start)

[23:55:36] <MatthiasVance> Then proceed :p
