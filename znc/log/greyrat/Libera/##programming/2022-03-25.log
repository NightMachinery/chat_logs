[01:31:37] <davros> there was a whole 'make a next gen amiga' project a while back

[04:41:40] <nomagno> Timesharing idea: I can add a round-robin flag to my VM's flag set. If the RR0 register/flag is set, normal execution is interrupted and instead a program counter is saved for subroutines index equal to the contents of register RR1, RR2, RR3, and RR4, with it being executed in instruction chunks equal to the value of RR0.
[04:42:00] <epony> sonny, yes, you have a couple of devices for this

[04:54:59] <Tazmainian> Then apple lost their way

[05:01:35] <sonny> tricky to pick a sentinel value for pointers

[06:08:10] <knusbaum> often, sure. It's also used in a lot of other ways.
[06:08:24] <epony> you can have software as a platform but it still runs on some hardware

[07:01:19] <kee> epony: Just take Windows and try running it on RISC-V.
[07:01:21] <knusbaum> vdamewood, I think BSD mostly happened because corporations lost interest in persuing their "intellectual property" claims once Linux was taking off.
[07:01:24] <kee> Oh, guess Windows isn't an OS.
[07:01:36] <kee> Chrome requires very little porting to port it to x86.
[07:01:44] <kee> But it requires some.

[07:03:30] <kee> It would take less effort than porting Windows to RISC-V.
[07:03:47] <kee> Chrome already has most of the code; you'd just need plumbing and a GPU driver.
[07:03:53] <kee> And a USB stack.
[07:03:58] <knusbaum> Chrome runs on an interface. Why does it matter whether that interface represents hardware or not?
[07:04:01] <epony> I don't know if Windows is well designed to run on RISC ISAs
[07:04:16] <epony> it definitely can not run well on ARM chips
[07:04:21] <vdamewood> knusbaum: The First full-system, open-source release of BSD predates Linus announcing of Linux.
[07:04:25] <kee> epony: That isn't a design thing.
[07:04:33] <epony> only it is
[07:04:33] <vdamewood> Linus's
[07:04:44] <knusbaum> vdamewood, I did not know that. I thought BSD was encumbered by legal issues well into Linux's lifetime. 
[07:04:45] <kee> Not an OS design thing. Maybe the port is less efficient than it could be.
[07:04:52] <oldlaptop> USL took a look at their source, and a look at NET/2 source, gravely noted that BSDi had gotten itself the phone number 1-800-ITS-UNIX, and decided that legal action was warranted. It turned out (after UCB itself intervened) that at *least* a vast majority of the common code was common because AT&T took BSD source (without attribution and therefore in violation of its license)
[07:05:03] <kee> Anyway, Chrome is designed well enough that it would get faster if you ran it bare-metal.
[07:05:11] <vdamewood> knusbaum: The legal issues happened as a result of the first full-system, open-source release.
[07:05:16] <knusbaum> vdamewood, maybe it was the license then that allowed Linux to grow and overtake the already established UNIXen.
[07:05:29] <knusbaum> vdamewood, ok, yeah that makes sense. That's what I thought.
[07:05:39] <knusbaum> vdamewood, or close to what I thought, rather.
[07:05:53] <oldlaptop> Many of the details were non-public at the time, but some years ago the full settlement agreement was released; this shed light on the degree to which USL capitulated in the settlement process.

[07:12:12] <knusbaum> It may not if BSD had fewer legal issues and better licenses.
[07:12:12] <epony> despite what Linus said as a hat-tip towards the BSDs
[07:12:21] <vdamewood> knusbaum: Not directly. Darwin is based on code that's based on 4.4BSD Lite. For a while, the userland was just copied straight from FreeBSD.

[07:38:07] <juliaEnv> I know how each of them works separately, but I haven't yet figured out how they are fitting together if you see what I mean. On one hand, project scope requires that you create a 3 level WBS or PBS and then create a textual multi-level scope from it with milestones. Req. eng. on the other hand requires that you elicit requirements by interviewing stakeholders to figure out their roles/workflows/business processes they do 
[07:38:07] <juliaEnv> and the domain they work with, or by reviewing documents, etc. and then you draw those processes and domain models, use cases, and figure out the inputs, processes, outputs.

[07:45:01] <kee> Your specification should talk about the scope.

[07:45:43] <kee> There is no Ideal way of doing these things.
[07:46:02] <kee> You have to cannibilise from different people's ideas, depending on the situation you find yourself in.
[07:46:20] <kee> If I were working on software for robotics, I'd probably pick up one of your software engineering books.
[07:46:35] <kee> (Or, better yet, ask one of my new colleagues how they do things.)

[08:05:21] <oldlaptop> knusbaum: It's far too important to pull thoughtlessly from some book.
[08:05:28] <knusbaum> yes
[08:05:28] <kee> You have to talk about it in great length until it turns out you were using completely different words for some things.
[08:05:55] <ollie> Raziel, yeah - it can get ugly, but it works nice enough. Obviously, if you can do integer division, you should use it for int(x/y); unfortunately the condition requires you to use float division to find if the decimal part is less than 0.5.
[08:06:01] <kee> juliaEnv: If you try to do things this way, you will fail.
[08:06:03] <Raziel> knusbaum, let's write a book about it. "Herding Cats - how to convince everyone that your collection of circus monkeys is, in fact, not yours"
[08:06:14] <knusbaum> And more importantly, any system that works one place with one project won't work somewhere else with some other project.

[08:14:08] <juliaEnv> IEEE defines engineering as âthe application of a systematic, disciplined, quantifiable approach to structures, machines, products, systems or processesâ
[08:14:22] <knusbaum> juliaEnv, It seems academic and idealized, like the product management strategies you're talking about.

[08:18:05] <ollie> Well... the issue is this table is in lua - ugh. I think what you suggest, duuude, is a good idea, as that ensures the keys are only repeated once (as the headers). What I might do is right a TSV parser to lua for my friend. I'll talk to them about it. 
[08:18:11] <oldlaptop> If you need to generate something the application understands, and you can't tell it to use utf-8, you're therefore stuck not using unicode at all.

[08:18:19] <kee> juliaEnv: Reasons engineering approaches don't apply to programming:
[08:18:42] <kee> â¢ Engineering needs to make multiple objects; code can be copy-pasted.
[08:18:53] <kee> â¢ Software is a set of instructions; engineering usually produces physical objects.
[08:19:32] <InPhase> knusbaum: In summary we've been over this before.  juliaEnv gets all notions of software engineering from one book that very few people have heard of, and repeatedly cites one document from 1968 that is largely inconsequential to the field, and then ignores the entire mass of the field at large.
[08:19:53] <kee> â¢ Physical objects are normally only affected by the things physically close to them. Software interfaces can be more powerful than that.
[08:19:54] <oldlaptop> InPhase: I don't remember the nick, but there was someone an awful lot like this back on old-freenode.
[08:20:01] <Haxxa> encoding is annoying, I am working on windows powershell scripts which interface with a linux based embedded device, it really is creating many headaches. 
[08:20:04] <knusbaum> InPhase, sounds like a fair summary. Has this happened before?

Software engineering was coined in 1968 at a NATO conference to address the software crisis, that is the state of people using ad-hoc approaches that result in software that is late, over budget, unreliable, and does not meet the needs very well. Software crisis is still today when you use crappy approaches. That's

[08:37:38] <oldlaptop> Haxxa: It sounds like the problem is precisely that your "proprietary app" does not speak UTF-8.
[08:38:10] <oldlaptop> Maybe you can tell it to do so, or maybe you need to tell whatever's generating the file to use whatever single-octet encoding the application uses instead.
[08:38:32] <oldlaptop> Are you aware that UTF-8 is a "variable-length encoding" and aware of what that means?
[08:38:43] <Haxxa> oldlaptop, Nah it was that powershell only outputs UTF-8 with BOM whether my app expects it without BOM, Powershell 6.0 fixed this
[08:39:25] * oldlaptop would like to see whoever at microsoft decided UTF-8-with-BOM was a good idea punished for this infamous crime
[08:39:42] <duuude> BOM?
[08:39:45] <oldlaptop> right along with whoever decided to use UTF-16 for everything
[08:40:35] <InPhase> oldlaptop: UTF-8 with BOM is also a pet peeve of mine.
[08:40:39] <oldlaptop> duuude: Unicode contains a special "Byte Order Mark" character, the idea being you put it at the beginning of a UTF-16 (or I suppose UCS-2) text so you can tell which endianness it uses.
[08:40:40] <flaqoniun> utf-16 was their most genius move!
[08:41:16] <knusbaum> that's disgusting
[08:41:22] <oldlaptop> Microsoft is stupidly evil (or evilly stupid?), and their products therefore have been known to generate UTF-8 texts with a BOM too, even though endianness is not relevant for UTF-8
[08:41:43] <knusbaum> I'm surprised that's even valid UTF-8.
[08:41:43] * duuude thinks the encoding problem is solved by extending EBCDIC to use UTF-16
[08:41:57] <knusbaum> Boooo on bell labs for allowing a BOM with UTF-8
[08:41:59] <InPhase> oldlaptop: Last year I had to implement special case removal of BOMs from CSV files just to handle the case of some people using the wrong Windows text editor / editor settings.
[08:42:07] <oldlaptop> knusbaum: I don't think it was their idea. :(
[08:42:16] <InPhase> oldlaptop: They were ascii CSV files.
[08:42:19] <knusbaum> oldlaptop, how is it valid UTF-8?
[08:42:27] <oldlaptop> InPhase: Now that's impressive.
[08:42:41] <oldlaptop> knusbaum: It's a Unicode character like any other, with a valid UTF-8 encoding
[08:42:50] <oldlaptop> it's just utterly useless and meaningless in a UTF-8 context

[08:43:54] <knusbaum> UTF-8 is awesome
[08:44:05] <knusbaum> unfortunately it has to implement unicode.
[08:44:49] <Haxxa> Yeah I feel like all my issues are just because MS decided to do it differently
[08:45:35] <duuude> whose fault is \n vs \r\n
[08:45:50] <knusbaum> why do you need two characters?
[08:46:11] <oldlaptop> anyhow, Haxxa: it still sounds like your application is interpreting your text as something other than UTF-8, and it appears to work without the BOM because without the BOM your text also happens to be valid ASCII (and therefore most likely valid windows-1252 or whatever the application actually expects)
[08:46:12] <knusbaum> It makes sense I guess on teletypes
[08:46:17] <duuude> because it started that way

[08:46:59] <Haxxa> oldlaptop, either way it works now I am outputting it as utf-8, it was utf16 at first and the utf-8 w/bom which caused all my headaches

[08:47:57] <oldlaptop> The BOM is just a really obvious problem.
[08:48:34] <oldlaptop> Some goofy accent, or fancy quotation mark (Microsoft knows a little about those too...), or something similar that you're not expecting, may yet cause corruption.
[08:49:26] <oldlaptop> (Even if you can safely assume your stuff only generates codepoints U+7F and below, you probably still want to configure it to generate ASCII to document that assumption for the future.)

[14:35:39] <user51> how would you handle right associativity?
[14:36:45] <pyzozord> with parens
[14:37:09] <pyzozord> I'm not sure what "right" associativity is
[14:37:22] <user51> a = b = c -> a = (b = c)
[14:37:22] <pyzozord> as far as I know associativity is based on operator precedence
[14:37:52] <user51> a - b = c -> (a - b) - c
[14:37:52] <pyzozord> ok, and what do you mean by "handle it"?
[14:38:03] <user51> how would you write it
[14:38:10] <pyzozord> write what exactly
[14:38:29] <pyzozord> a-b=c is not a statement you can do in computer programming
[14:38:36] <pyzozord> unless you are doing some math simulation
[14:38:43] <kee> Works in C.
[14:38:45] <kee> a-(b=c)
[14:38:47] <DnzAtWrk> I'm sure some language can handle it
[14:38:56] <piou> postfix/prefix contains the same information so convertion is always possible, not sure about shunting yard itself for that
[14:39:05] <DnzAtWrk> but it's dumb still, considering programming isn't math equations
[14:39:08] <pyzozord> well yeah I mean it will end up being a - (b=c)
[14:39:24] <pyzozord> but that' snot what was intended by user51's expression I think
[14:39:43] <pyzozord> err, that's not, sorry unfortunate typo there
[14:39:47] <kee> DnzAtWrk: It should be.
[14:39:47] <kee> That's what FORTRAN was all about, wasn't it?
[14:39:48] <user51> basically, for right associativity i thought you'd need a loop
[14:39:57] <DnzAtWrk> I don't think so no
[14:40:06] <user51> just in case you get v1 = v2 = v3 = v4 = vN
[14:40:11] <pyzozord> user51: I don't understand what problem you are trying to solve
[14:40:17] <DnzAtWrk> I agree that programming languages should have better support for vector arithmetic, like with numpy in python, R or Matlab, or as you said fortran
[14:40:24] <DnzAtWrk> but that's not quite the same thing
[14:40:42] <user51> pyzozord: my bad then. gimme a sec.
[14:42:36] <user51> if you had an operator like '^', which should be parsed as a^(b^(c)), what would you use? recursion or loops?
[14:44:01] <beaky> i would use recursion of course 
[14:44:08] <piou> aside from the fact that any loop can be written with recursion?
[14:44:14] <piou> and inverse?
[14:44:31] <kee> Why not just collect it into ^[a, b, c]?
[14:44:48] <kee> Then the associativity can be something to do with the operator, rather than something to do with the parser.
[14:44:54] <DnzAtWrk> I'd use that stack thing which you use when you parse and tokenize expressions

[14:53:19] <user51> i sould have probably just started with the s-expr version

[14:58:32] <ProfSimm> parsers are super easy :/
[14:58:34] <user51> basically, my conclusion is that you'd need infinite(?) lookahead for right associativity, so it was either loops or recursion. but maybe there's a better way i didn't think of.
[14:58:36] <piou> In C for example (a=b)=c and a=(b=c) are different things, and that's just not associative, but a = b = c is equivalent to the later expression so it must be parsed in the right order
[14:58:40] <ProfSimm> But only when you figure some thigns out
[14:59:03] <pyzozord> user51: I think that's what step g) is https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/24/Shunting_yard.svg. It decides it must pop the x and + before it can push -, I think that decision controls associativity
[14:59:17] <user51> i shot myself statring from the foot to the head in a straight line trying to understand parsing :)
[14:59:17] <ProfSimm> user51: look at the infix() method, it's left-associative by default. You make it right-associative if the second operand is calling the expression handler recursively

[15:22:10] <ProfSimm> user51: but I'm not sure I will. Because... I mean your example is kinda extreme
[15:22:21] <audio> like, use s3boto or something to unzip the zip file directly at s3? no uploading/downloading?

[15:24:37] <user51> my first instinct is always to test against infinity

[15:30:26] <user51> ProfSimm: as far as my parsing approach goes: each symbol is either a string, regex, or function. they're composed together as rules. each rule is just a call to variadic function like rule(first, second, nth). left-recursive rules are handled after a match has been found, basically a return

[16:51:22] <vdamewood> aruns: Well, tha't the point to matching things by semver. You get the latest one that supports the one you say.
[16:51:56] <aruns> I see
[16:51:59] <aruns> So even if I specify 1.0.0
[16:52:03] <aruns> It will get 1.1.0
[16:52:10] <vdamewood> Yep.
[16:52:11] <pyzozord> aruns: no I mean the actual tag in the git repo is 1.0 instead of 1.0.0 so you can't do anything
[16:52:15] <pyzozord> I'm guessing though
[16:52:19] <vdamewood> You will not get 2.0.0 thouhg.

[19:23:36] <oldlaptop> C does not.
[19:24:01] <oldlaptop> (The committee is supposedly thinking about defining it, in the next standard, but has not done so yet.)

[19:25:21] <KillerWasp> both work fine
[19:25:37] <piou> that's missing the point of undefined behaviour
[19:25:50] <oldlaptop> They pretend to work, with your compiler, on your OS, with your optimization flags, today.
[19:26:36] <KillerWasp> oldlaptop: ?
[19:26:55] <piou> that UB gives the expected result once doesn't mean anything because it's not even guaranteed to be reproducible
[19:27:15] <KillerWasp> Well, if the compiler compiles in such a way as to attack any overflow in the number, it's definitely wrong.
[19:27:36] <oldlaptop> The applicable standard, however, says the behavior (at least of the second one, I don't recall what, if anything in particular, is supposed to happen if you give %d an out-of-range unsigned value) is undefined.
[19:27:57] <piou> (I mean, you could inspect the code generated and conclude that in this case the compiler did produce deterministic code that does what you want, but that's beside what the language allows or guarantees)

[19:28:36] <Bou> It can still be application defined, like the printf of (int*)0 which can totally work on some systems

[19:29:11] <oldlaptop> Bou: Implementations are permitted to make and document their own guarantees about undefined behavior, if that's what you mean.
[19:29:29] <oldlaptop> gcc has the -ftrapv and -fwrapv flags, for example.
[19:30:04] <piou> The point of using a language that has a standard is that a valid program can be compiled on a different system with a different compiler and get the same result. Undefined behaviour breaks this.
[19:30:42] <KillerWasp> The only thing that bothers me is that C has no way to return a flag overflow that occurred in the code.

[22:16:26] <InPhase> oldlaptop: UTF-32 requires a BOM if used as a transmission or storage medium, but UTF-32 is basically never used as a transmission or storage medium, so it should pretty much never be encountered.

[22:20:33] <oldlaptop> The cost of its outrageous space-inefficiency is steadily declining relative to the benefit of fixed-width characters (since the former is relative to the cost of storage and the latter is basically constant)

[22:22:05] <oldlaptop> in practice I think the real reason UTF-8 has won for most use cases has absolutely nothing to do with space efficiency, it's mostly a function of being a clean superset of ASCII
[22:22:13] <ProfSimm> oldmagic: transmission in particular is already a stream, it's not indexable. Why have fixed width, there's no benefit to it.

[22:22:38] <InPhase> oldlaptop: It's possible at some point we would just swap to UTF-32.  If you have compression going on (like web communication) then UTF-32 is probably not very different.  Also, text tends to be a small part of data.
[22:23:02] <oldlaptop> Web stuff in *particular* is probably going to be dominated by ASCII compatibility for a long, long time
[22:23:26] <InPhase> Yeah, which is why web stuff rarely benefits from UTF-16 encodings.
[22:23:36] <ProfSimm> InPhase: the biggest part of a modern web page tends to be the JS. Even after compression. Hence text remains a top factor.
[22:23:42] <oldlaptop> (I don't think text really is a "small part of the data" for modern web applications, not if you define css and (especially) js source as text)
[22:23:50] <InPhase> Even if you happen to be displaying one of the languages where it's fractionally more compact, the html dominates the space consumption.
[22:24:07] <InPhase> Or JS.
[22:24:17] <kee> 00:14:29 <kee> nomagno: Processors normally do that with a timer interrupt â a register counts down, and then stashes the current PC somewhere / jumps to the interrupt handler.
[22:24:51] <InPhase> ProfSimm: Well when lockdowns hit nobody was commenting about all the javascript flying around.  :)  It was netflix eating up bandwidth.
[22:25:20] <kee> ProfSimm: You can transform recursive code to non-recursive code by making the stack and state machine explicit.
[22:25:43] <InPhase> But I concur utf-8 is by far the smart choice for web delivery, because it is already a pretty well tuned compact representation format.

[22:30:20] <pyzozord> ProfSimm: and the wrapUp?
[22:30:22] <ProfSimm> pyzozord: wrapUp builds the "term" from existing state and returns it. I isolated it only because I expect more code in it, and i need it in a few places.

[22:47:32] <ProfSimm> pyzozord: I'm currently rewriting infix to allow things like 1+2+3+4 to be compiled as basically sum(1, 2, 3, 4) instead of what you see there, which produces sum(sum(sum(1, 2), 3), 4) i.e. in pairs
[22:47:39] <oldlaptop> Most of this same stuff applies to accessibility guidelines as well, incidentally.
[22:47:48] <ProfSimm> pyzozord: it'll produce a cleaner tree
[22:47:50] <kee> oldlaptop: I just thought of that too.
[22:48:05] <kee> If you had text saying where the static bits were meant to be, and you didn't hide that to a screen reader, free accessibility!
[22:48:19] <kee> Heck, does it really need to be hidden?
[22:48:46] <pulse> i will agree that some type of content needs no JS, and most web developers seem to not understand that
[22:48:56] <oldlaptop> That's /all anyone is trying to say/.

[22:50:39] <kee> pulse: Promotional content is the main reason I turn JS off, even on the 8GB laptop. It spins up the fan like nobody's business, and makes the scrolling go all jolty.

[23:20:25] <oldlaptop> Ah.
[23:20:44] <pyzozord> btw alt+shift+( or ) scrolls horizontally in less
[23:20:44] <amazigh> I mean, when the user click on a link, it print the url possibly the html of the rendered page to be able to index it

[23:23:16] <kee> This concludes the list of options.

The problem I am having is that the algorithms follows a sort of natural structure, where parts in the graph that are "ahead" have higher (integer) coordinates, however, I would also like to run my algorithm the same over sequences which have "reverse" or "minus strand" coordinates, where everything 
[23:49:46] <octav1a> now "starts" at higher numerical coordinates and ends at lower-valued coordinates. For example, a simple operation to trim a sequence on the normal "plus" strand might be to set start +=1 and end -= 1 , but on the minus strand this would need to be the opposite, start -=1 and end += 1.  I'm trying to conceptualize some way to not need to manually write every single function again in reverse, and somehow transform coordinates back and forth. Does
