[02:45:36] <jemarch> I am working in an Emacs interface for GNU poke (https://jemarch.net/poke).  It is already quite useful and I will send it to ELPA soon.  It is currently called poke.el (you can find it at https://git.savannah.nongnu.org/cgit/poke.git/plain/poke-el/poke.el) but since there is also a poke-mode.el and other gnupokeish emacs thingies, I think I need another name for the interface.

[04:51:37] <ytc> when i type `C-h' it says `C-x' in echo area, as it supposed to.

[05:10:20] <parsnip> doesn't work?
[05:10:47] <parsnip> ytc: why are you doing this?
[05:11:19] <parsnip> oh, to swap key chords
[05:11:26] <MysteriousSilver> it does work, but i dont understand what ytc says with "C-x in echo area"
[05:11:45] <parsnip> like if you type C-x, and wait a second
[05:11:52] <parsnip> then C-x- shows up in echo area
[05:12:03] <parsnip> for some default delay
[05:12:35] <bpalmer> I was going to suggest calling keyboard-translate instead, but  https://groups.google.com/g/gnu.emacs.help/c/Yi_mUQdYGpM/m/2mt3TAcS3OAJ  has stefan monnier believing key-translation-map is safer.
[05:13:58] <bpalmer> (the translation going on is slightly different than simply rebinding them; for example, if the keys are translated, then C-c C-x   should actually invoke C-c C-h   and C-c C-h should invoke C-c C-x , and the rebinding only happens at the top level)
[05:14:34] <ytc> MysteriousSilver: now, C-h behaves like C-x, but on the echo area, it says `C-h' :D

[17:02:30] <mekeor[m]> "alphapapa/ement.el")) (use-package plz :straight (plz :host github :repo "alphapapa/plz.el"))` but it keeps telling me `error: Could not find package plz. Updating recipe repositories: (org-elpa melpa gnu-elpa-mirror el-get emacsmirror-mirror) with ‘straight-pull-recipe-repositories’ may fix this`. any ideas how to fix this?

[23:50:28] <twrk> or into forced fortnite play modes
[23:50:48] <aidalgol> Who plays Fortnite besides kids, though?
[23:50:59] <acdw> not i, said the chicken
[23:51:13] <artefact> fornite.el, when??
[23:51:13] <fsbot> Outlook not so good

[23:51:55] <acdw> lmao
[23:52:05] <artefact> so it's just nethack, but with shinier colours?
[23:52:07] <acdw> (defun fortnite () (floss))
[23:52:09] <aidalgol> bpalmer: Is that a Lunar Lander reference?
[23:52:38] <aidalgol> artefact: I believe they're called "tilesets"
[23:52:41] <bpalmer> I'll have you know the moon base is coming along nicely.
[23:52:51] <artefact> "The gnome zaps a wand! The ray bounces off the wall! You die-- do you want to see your attributes? [ynq]"
[23:53:20] <bpalmer> Do not spend time considering your attributes lest you fall prey to a narcissus curse.
[23:53:21] <aidalgol> Nethack isn't a game; it's a collection of bullshit deaths glued together.
[23:53:39] <artefact> You were pious. You were an emacser. You were illiterate.

[23:54:13] <aidalgol> An illiterate emacser?
[23:54:29] <bremner> starter kit user, presumably
[23:54:43] <bremner> I kid, I kid.
[23:54:50] <aidalgol> sick burn, bro
[23:54:51] <bremner> all emacs users are valid
[23:55:04] <bremner> heck, vim users are mostly fine too
[23:55:16] <artefact> in fact nethack is one of the few programs i still run in xterm (over vterm). because it unironically has higher fps
[23:55:37] <bremner> uh. it's turn-based?
[23:56:33] <aidalgol> Why on earth does anyone still play nethack when there are now better-designed dungeon crawlers in the same spirit?
[23:56:41] <aidalgol> e.g. DCSS
[23:56:54] <bpalmer> I wouldn't want to violate the DMCA
[23:57:04] <aidalgol> bpalmer: wut?
[23:57:08] <artefact> because the devs have thought of everything
[23:57:18] <aidalgol> uh, sure, buddy
[23:57:21] <twrk> brand recognition? fun? Why on earth would anyone play checkers when it's fundamentally flawed?!
[23:57:33] <bpalmer> (psst, decss was a thing, upon a time)
[23:57:35] <artefact> "checkers is (weakly) solved! stop having fun!"
[23:57:54] <acdw> is DCSS better?

[23:58:05] <aidalgol> No, seriously, nethack is full of bullshit death.
[23:58:27] <artefact> there's a few parts of nethack i don't like-- the sokoban and the gehemnon maze levels
[23:58:42] <artefact> the bullshit deaths are, mostly, due to pebkac
[23:58:43] <aidalgol> artefact: checkers is a completely different type of game, so that analogy doesn't really work.
[23:59:03] <aidalgol> I strongly disagree that dying in nethack is usually the player's fault.
[23:59:16] <artefact> though i hear elbereth was nerfed a lot. my last serious ascension was in 3.4.3
[23:59:47] <artefact> i would agree that the game is very hard, and frustrating, without spoilers
[23:59:50] <acdw> i've never made it past like, level 3
