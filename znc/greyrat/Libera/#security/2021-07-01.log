[12:06:25] <rnkn> so, the RSA key encrypts the AES key, but the encrypted AES key is stored inside the tar archive, so if an attacker were to get the tar archive, they would still need to crack the RSA encryption of the AES key, but does this then make the AES encryption meaningless?

[12:08:48] <lts> That sounds like the way a standard TLS connection is handled. Asymmetric key exchange, then send symmetric key and encrypt the rest with the symmetric key
[12:12:06] <rnkn> lts: isn't that due to speed/efficiency of AES? if we're just doing the odd password encryption locally, that's aspect is probably negligible

[12:15:44] <lts> Well, AES is easier to get Right, but if you have the key next to it.. I'm not really getting the point. Maybe they want to make comparing ciphertexts more difficult. Or reduce the size of the end result.

[12:18:03] <rnkn> yeah given we're talking pretty tiny text files (just a username and password) size isn't really an issue

[12:29:52] <lts> One has to dive into RSA specs to catch what is the exact problem they are avoiding with this. Is it key reuse, or do the modulus mathematics simply stop working when plaintext is larger than key. You'd be right that comparing ciphertexts (especially XORing them) gives out information in most cryptosystems, however RSA is rather resilient to it. It's been too long for me to remember was this one of the
[12:29:54] <lts> issues with the "naive" RSA which has since been augmented in many ways to become the standard RSA of today
[12:30:48] <lts> The most practical reason is that the RSA standard says the plaintext+padding shall not be longer than key

[12:32:34] <rnkn> I guess the main thing is that this RSA+AES would be the best practice
[12:33:59] <lts> That enables significantly longer secrets to be stored indeed. Trying to fit username + password + notes + other metadata to 245 bytes would not allow for very long passphrases
[12:34:47] <lts> Longer of course if you use a bigger RSA key (as one likely should), but still not too large for comfort. RSA+AES seems a wise solution here.

[16:42:45] <soulisson> piou, yeah, I wouldn't consider them as part of the attack but rather preparatory steps. For me the steps are 1 - Request to the attacker's site 2 - Redirection Code to the target web application 3 - Request to the target applications 4  - Dangerous operations, ...
[16:45:59] <piou> 4 isn't a thing, the request is the dangerous operation, 1 doesn't have to be since there may be no attacker's website, there is no redirection in a CSRF just the request so 2 isn't a thing either

[17:03:35] <jkc> It's neither opinion-based nor probabilistic, so how you see it doesn't mean much, and "maybe" is fairly meaningless. The attack component of a CSRF is the forged request. There it is.
[17:03:57] <soulisson> jkc, there is no wrong or right. It depends on the wording. This is from OWASP: "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is an attack that forces an end user to execute unwanted actions on a web application in which they’re currently authenticated."
[17:04:09] <piou> soulisson: an attack is an attack even if it fails, having step 3 be part of it makes no sense. As for the "code execution that makes your browser send the request" there's no such thing. You'll have a form doing a POST request, or an image doing a GET request or a regular link... But there is value in not restricting how the attack is sent because that allows focusing on the attack itself: the
[17:04:15] <piou> request. No matter how the server received the request if it receives the request then there's a CSRF attack.
[17:05:02] <jkc> soulisson: So, to formulate this as an answer to your original question of "Are the operations that occur before the sending of the request to the target web application considered as part of the attack?"... No. They're not.
[17:05:10] <piou> soulisson: naming is a matter of convention, and the convention everybody abides by is that the CSRF is the request and that's it.
[17:05:28] <soulisson> piou, how do you trick the browser into sending the POST request from an html page?
[17:05:45] <piou> soulisson: you don't trick it, it's your web page, it can do a POST request normally
[17:05:55] *** Joins: shad (~shad@user/shad)
[17:06:42] <piou> soulisson: if you have a link in the page it is actually doing a GET request. No trick involved. If you have a form it does a POST request (by default). No trick involved. Just a regular webpage with regular (old-school even) html.

[17:08:09] <soulisson> piou, the form has to be sent. The user has to click or you've to make the browser send it. Usually we want to avoid the user to be suspicious, so we use some javascript to make the browser send it. This is what I called tricking
[17:08:53] <piou> soulisson: you can get the user to click, you can use javascript (still no trick, that's your webpage), you may also not need a POST request at all

[17:09:56] <piou> At most you may be tricking the user into clicking a button, but that's no different from having that user follow a link to your website in the first place, that's common social engineering outside of the CSRF itself
[17:09:58] <soulisson> piou, my english is not great. I don't know how to call this. POST requests are not always the case.
[17:10:49] <soulisson> yes, some CSRF attacks involve Social Engineering before.
[17:10:49] <piou> Consider the case where a GET request is enough to change a password (eg: http://example.com/user/chgpasswd?newpasswd=XXX). You may not even need a malicious website.
[17:11:16] <piou> soulisson: and that's the point: the CSRF attack is the request. You may need other shenanigans to set it up, but the attack itself is the request.

You've then wasted, so far, 40 minutes of peoples' time arguing against the validity of the answer you received to your own question, and your arguments have revealed a near-total lack of understanding of the basic concepts about which you're arguing. The best thing you can do right now is step back and study the topic

It's been that way for years and that's just the way things are, there's no point getting upset about it and calling him out for "wasting" time. No time is wasted, if someone doesn't want to answer they just won't.

[17:15:16] <jkc> There's a difference between precision and continually arguing the same point.

[19:19:47] <jkc> Here's a fun one from work today. "DKIM is failing." Yeah, you're signing it with a key that's not authorized for that domain. "Well, its been like this for five years, and its always worked." Then its been failing for five years, which means it's never worked. DKIM failing means you don't have DKIM. "But..." No. You don't have DKIM. That's a finding.

[19:44:11] <uoj6wz6qoswb> its claiming it can make my computer more powerful, faster and resistent to viruses. has anyone been that dumb since downloadmoreram.com
[19:44:12] <jkc> I've heard of Zorin, but I haven't mucked with it.
[19:44:41] <jkc> If you're coming from Windows, I don't see the inherent problem in those claims.
[19:45:01] <uoj6wz6qoswb> i measure most of my computers by clock speed core count and ram
[19:45:01] <soulisson> uoj6wz6qoswb, who/what's claiming that?
[19:45:20] <uoj6wz6qoswb> just googled the zorin site to look at a screenshot :P
[19:45:47] <jkc> uoj6wz6qoswb: Those are some of the least useful specs to judge a system by.
[19:46:20] <uoj6wz6qoswb> i know right its the software that really makes the difference ^_^
[19:46:20] <soulisson> uoj6wz6qoswb, oh ok :) It's certainly better than windows :)
[19:47:09] <soulisson> I always tried Pop OS and MX Linux but I didn't like them too much despite being very popular
[19:47:12] <uoj6wz6qoswb> it doesnt even look that bad, but advertising like that just reminds me of all the unhackable security products
