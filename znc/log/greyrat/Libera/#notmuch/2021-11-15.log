[17:57:45] <fauno> i manually removed the flintlock and running notmuch again (new, compact) leaves the lock after crashing
[17:58:11] <fauno> searching throws "terminate called after throwing an instance of 'Xapian::DatabaseModifiedError'"

[22:19:49] <andi-> Curiously I also had my database blow up today after many years of usage. I noticed a couple of days ago that notmuch compact wouldn't work anymore. It threw some exception when compacting the termlist. Then today I couldn't run notmuch new anymore as it would hang there waiting forever... Having waited an hour, double and triple checked no other process was accessing the db but it was being
[22:19:51] <andi-> waited on the (file) lock. Eventually I killed that process and tried xapian-analyze,.. it segfaulted shortly after starting. I did a full FS check on my ZFS mirror and that looks fine. I was able to export my tags using notmuch dump so I decided to recreate the database (and moved the old .notmuch folder away). Initially it claimed that importing my ~3M mails would only take 3h but now (4h into
[22:19:53] <andi-> this) it is claiming it'll take another 5h. I'll probably sit this one out but are there any know issues with indexing large archives? This feels like not that many mails.
