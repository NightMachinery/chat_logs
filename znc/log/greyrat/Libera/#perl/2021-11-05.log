[00:56:02] <djerius> damn. all of a sudden it works.  Now I have to figure out what I did.
[00:56:08] <mst> hah
[00:56:18] <mst> oh, modern sybase often supports ODBC which can be less finicky
[00:56:25] <mst> or at least differently finicky ;)
[00:56:54] <djerius> I'm still getting the "Message String: Server name not found in configuration files" but it's passing the login tests.
[00:57:43] <mst> probably there's a local config file that has the remote server in it but not localhost?
[00:58:35] <djerius> shouldn't be any local config;  I haven't sullied this box with Sybase until now.
[00:59:28] <djerius> I actually tried setting a local "interfaces" file in the dsn, but strace indicated that DBD::Sybase was ignoring it, so I did something wrong.

[20:13:25] <ether> the Test2 boolean check is too loose, as it will accept '' for false and 1 for true -- I think xq wants to know that it's a true boolean, i.e. will be json-serialized as a bool
[20:13:35] <ether> ..which is exactly what is_bool looks for
[20:13:54] <ether> it doesn't accept \0 and \1 though, which some json serializers recognize

[20:40:34] <Exodist> Is there an easy/obvious tool I can use, where I give it an instance of something, and find out which parent class(es) define a specific method so I can go track them down? Specifically I am modifying a method, but my changes have no effect, so the method is probably from somewhere else, but done magically because I cannot find any other places that define it
[20:41:12] <Exodist> I don't feel like manually walking @ISA, but I can if thats what I have to do
[20:42:43] *** Joins: dansan (~daniel@75.81.148.51)
[20:45:53] <ether> some combination of $class->can($name) and Sub::Util to figure out where it lives?
[20:47:47] <ether> perl -MSub::Util -wle'package Foo { sub foo {} }; package Bar { our @ISA = "Foo" }; my $sub = Bar->can("foo"); print Sub::Util::subname($sub)'
[20:47:50] <ether> Foo::foo
[20:50:30] <Exodist> specifically I think multiple parents and/or roles all bring in the same method by importing it from another place. I override that polace, but I think it is too late as the places that import it still have the old version, but I cannot figure out which base/role specifically I am hitting, and subname just gives me the name of the original one I already overrode.
[20:52:57] <Grinnz> if you can debug at runtime caller(0) might be useful?
[20:53:13] <Grinnz> though i guess not if in an override
[20:53:29] <Grinnz> Devel::Trace?
[20:53:41] <Grinnz> er, that's not the one
[20:54:28] <Exodist> according to this there are no base classes, so I must be doing symbol manipulation wrong? https://pastebin.com/zu9VcjGU

[20:54:29] <Repaster> Repasted text from Exodist: http://perl.bot/p/ckonue
[20:55:17] <Exodist> just trying to get a list of all the base classes which have manually_add_coverage_data  in their namespace
[20:55:40] <Exodist> so no ->can(), need to check each classes symbol table
[20:55:45] <Grinnz> `next unless &{"$class\::manually_add_coverage_data"};` will call the subroutine and return if it returns true
[20:55:51] <Grinnz> act on if*
[20:55:59] <Grinnz> you probably wanted unless defined
[20:56:04] <Exodist> ok, well it does not even get that far as it only looks at the main class, none of the bases
[20:56:37] <Exodist> so my push of the clases @ISA seems to not work, but also not generate any errors
[20:56:49] <Exodist> which is perplexing
[20:56:57] <ether> are you doing this within the context of the sub you are overriding? if so you can use next::can() from the mro package.
[20:57:31] <Exodist> no, I am doing it from another method that calls $self->manually_add_coverage_data() so I can see which one it is about to call
[20:58:02] <Exodist> ah, hmm, the defined change did fix it so that it iterated all the classes
[20:58:45] <Exodist> hmm, looks like the only class that defines it is the one I overrode it in, but my overrides have no effect, so I am flummoxed.
[20:59:09] <ether> sounds like an X-Y problem
[21:00:28] <Exodist> I know the class brings it in from a role. Then I have an override that gives me an override warning telling me I did replace the method, and my prints saying the override is happening go. But when I call the method none of the prints in the overriden form fire.
[21:01:04] <furrymcgee> cant you run the perl debugger to see this?
[21:01:15] <Exodist> no.
[21:01:55] <Exodist> it is inside a unit test after like 6 forks in an app that takes 60 seconds to load enough for the test to run, and for some reason the debugger breaks some of the behaviors before it even gets here.
[21:02:05] <Exodist> this codebase is fairly crazy, and I am trying to fix that
[21:02:10] <mst> Exodist: why not just use the MOP ?

[23:08:30] <revhippie> oof... mysql docs re: "ALLOW_INVALID_DATES"

[23:08:47] <revhippie> well, that's a handy feature.  "this is intended to support garbage."
[23:08:57] <xenu> lmao

[23:17:05] <vanfanel64> A better fate than the one in maniac mansion
[23:19:47] <vanfanel64> I really want to know, was there a bug somewhere where people got 2021-00-07 for a date?
[23:21:16] <shaldannon> ehm ... so ...
[23:21:24] <Grinnz> revhippie: and if you dont have strict mode on, even if you don't ALLOW_INVALID_DATES it converts that to 0000-00-00 instead of erroring
[23:21:32] <shaldannon> I can't speak to user input, because users often do stupid user tricks ...
[23:22:13] <shaldannon> but there are some applications where that makes sense ... e.g., where a document is known to have a certain month and year for the creation date, but not a day
[23:22:25] <shaldannon> that's done in litigation support
[23:22:29] <shaldannon> ask me how I know
[23:22:49] <revhippie> Grinnz: I guess that lets you check if the date is 0000-00-00 instead of checking to see if each pieces is valid.  Easier in a query?
[23:22:56] <ether> ISO8601 has defined formats for year-month-but-not-day
[23:23:00] <ether> iirc
[23:23:02] <vanfanel64> shaldannon, I was once looking at a database table poopulated by a web based form, where one field was for phone number. One user had entered "fruity pebbles" which was causing the backend application to crash.
[23:23:10] <shaldannon> LMAO
[23:23:12] <Grinnz> revhippie: nobody ever does that though
[23:23:14] <shaldannon> that's awesome
[23:23:22] <revhippie> Grinnz: fair 'nuf
[23:24:01] <Grinnz> shaldannon: yes, and in that case you don't pretend it belongs in a DATE column :P
[23:24:09] <shaldannon> ofc in our web app that supported the litigation, we stored it all in an Oracle XML CLOB without defined field types beyond "text", so chances of it failing type validation were nil
[23:24:47] <shaldannon> but that doesn't mean other applications don't try to force it (e.g., kCura Relativity, which is an idiotic name)
[23:24:55] <ether> I wish Zoom would let you poke your head into a meeting to see how many other people are there, without actually joining
[23:25:08] <ether> it would save me from joining meetings that I thought would be large, but aren't
[23:25:10] <Grinnz> shaldannon: some date math recognizes the YEAR_MONTH format, and for other things you can add a -01 as a dummy day
[23:25:22] <shaldannon> yeah, we had to do that for kCura
[23:25:22] <genio> ether: ooooh. now _that_ would be nice
[23:25:26] <ether> I should just stop attending any meeting without a defined agenda
[23:25:40] <vanfanel64> shaldannon, I assume the XML was itself stored in a table row field, because I have seen that.
[23:25:49] <ether> twice now I've been hoodwinked by HR types to join "focus groups" for some crap I don't care about, and there's like 2 other people there so I can't politely just walk out
[23:25:54] <shaldannon> it was, yes
[23:26:11] <shaldannon> called "metadata", cleverly enough
[23:26:40] <vanfanel64> That is, where all the would-be row fields were all packed in a single field in the row. Just one column.
[23:26:40] * shaldannon got really sick of XML Clob extractValue calls
[23:26:57] <shaldannon> mostly.  we still had separate key fields
[23:27:17] <vanfanel64> That is already hugely better than what I dealt with then
[23:27:52] <shaldannon> useful when you realize that idiots send first_bates, firstbates, begin_bates, begbates, startbates, begno, and any number of other things that all condense down to the same thing

[23:32:20] <shaldannon> other fun times ... like the one where someone started a process to render several million document pages to tiff using Image::Magick ... filled up the better part of a multi TB filesystem and kept on going
[23:32:36] <shaldannon> nah ... involved me quitting for another job
[23:33:57] <shaldannon> or the one where someone scanned a 50-odd foot seismograph printout into a single tiff ... and then someone else tried to use Image::Magick to do a 90 degree rotational transform on it in memory ... that didn't end well
[23:34:37] <shaldannon> truthfully it didn't really end.  we had to kill the pid because it was consuming all the resources on the rendering server
[23:35:10] <vanfanel64> haha
