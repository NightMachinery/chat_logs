[00:19:27] <earnest> Well
[00:19:43] <earnest> If you're using awk then you can more or less gain this function y just comparing the field directly

[02:53:16] <e36freak> well, an extended regex sure. a traditional POSIX regex no

[02:53:36] <e36freak> it would be much, much more painful than just reading the input and using a state machine
[02:53:44] <phogg> definitely true

[05:31:55] <wiscii> i see
[05:32:35] <wiscii> it must be something todo with the pipe itself launching the next part ?
[05:32:57] <larryv> a pipe can't launch anything. it's a pipe
[05:33:13] <Blondie101010> it doesn't really matter...  you could start them separately on a named pipe to see how it behaves
[05:34:07] <Blondie101010> basically the `ps|grep grep` output tells us that ps starts outputing before it checks the process list
[05:34:27] <wiscii> my curiosity was more about how bash launches the externals ..
[05:34:29] <Blondie101010> which may be intentional
[05:35:34] <wiscii> both ps and grep being external .. the anonymous pipe "links" to both ?

[14:20:17] <chilversc> Though I still don't understand the "not executed" part. That documentation is just unintelligable :)
[14:21:00] <emanuele6> it means that it does not execute the last command in the background
[14:21:01] <tirnanog> "pipeline that is not executed"
[14:21:30] <tirnanog> as in, it can't very well run the last command of a pipeline in the foreground shell where it was instructed to go into the background.
[14:21:49] <tirnanog> # set +m; shopt -s lastpipe; echo 1 | read -r var & declare -p var
[14:21:50] <shbot> tirnanog: [1] 52
[14:21:51] <shbot> tirnanog: bash: declare: var: not found
[14:22:00] <emanuele6> that `not executed' should be interpreted as an adverb for `runs', not as an adjective for the process
[14:22:01] <tirnanog> that doesn't work but reasonably so.
[14:22:02] <chilversc> nope, I still read that "a pipeline" that was not executed
[14:23:23] <chilversc> saying adverb doesn't make it any clearer, and having to sit down and figure out some sort of linguistic challenge isn't the sign of plain, simple documentation :)

[14:24:54] <tirnanog> unless baz was backgrounded.
[14:24:57] <gnoo> normally, it would be in a subshell

[14:25:26] <gnoo> and backgrounding will always(?) put things in a subshell
[14:25:30] <chilversc> so if you have something like foo | bar | baz, baz would be executed in the context of the current shell, instead of a subshell?
[14:25:41] <gnoo> if you enable lastpipe, yes
[14:25:48] <tirnanog> as was demonstrated, yes.
[14:26:17] <tirnanog> # set +m; shopt -s lastpipe; echo $BASHPID; : | echo "$BASHPID"

[14:26:34] <shbot> tirnanog: 44
[14:26:34] <shbot> tirnanog: 52
[14:27:45] <chilversc> so I think it would be clearer if the docs simply removed "not executed", something like "the shell runs the last command of a pipeline in the current shell environment instead of a subshell" ?

[14:28:49] <emanuele6> whatever you mean by that

[14:30:48] <emanuele6> "it runs it not executed in the background"
[14:31:26] <chilversc> yes, but it sounds like it's refering to a pipeline that was "not executed in the background", as if that pipeline is something that's already happened
[14:31:55] <chilversc> It just reads like "not executed in the background" is an attribute of the pipeline, not a behaviour that is going to be applied to the pipeline
[14:32:47] <emanuele6> then why did you keep isolating "not executed"?
[14:33:04] <tirnanog> I suppose it could work without.
[14:33:50] <tirnanog> you'd need to make Chet believe it. we can change the factoids here but not the official documentation.

[14:34:34] <emanuele6> i thought you understood "runs ... in the background" "pipeline not executed", but now it sounds like you understood "runs ..." "pipeline not executed in the background"
[14:35:51] <tirnanog> I was never confused by the grammar, but it might be a superflous detail. after all, backgrounding does imply a subshell, irrespective of whether said subshell's parent was, itself, a subshell.
[14:36:15] <chilversc> yeah, its more like "not executed in the background" is an attribute of the "last command of a pipeline", thus a "last command of a pipeline" with the attribute of being "not executed in the background" would be executed in the current shell environment
[14:37:09] <emanuele6> <chilversc > also the phrasing on that documentation is horrible, I cannot figure out what it's trying to say. Why would you run a command that was not executed?
[14:37:25] <tirnanog> it's obviously trying to point out that lastpipe can't coerce everything into running into the foreground shell. that might be considered obvious if you already know what backgrounding is.
[14:37:26] <chilversc> even the word instead and a few commas would probably make it a bit clearer, "If set, and job control is not active, the shell runs the last command of a pipeline, not executed in the background but instead is executed in the current shell environment."
[14:37:38] <emanuele6> ok, originally it didn't sound like you were grouping "not executed" and "in the background" together
[14:37:39] <tirnanog> that's a fair point, but somewhat removed from the phrasing being horrible. I wouldn't go that far.
[14:37:39] *** Joins: sinaowolabi_ (~SinaOwola@160.152.106.62)
[14:38:01] <chilversc> something like that, but currently it all just runs together and makes it rather hard to read
[14:38:03] <emanuele6> but now you say you interpreted "not executed" and "in the background" together as an attribute of "the last command"
[14:38:32] <tirnanog> anyway, I agree on that particular point. I can't see any obvious need to mention backgrounding at all.
[14:39:10] <chilversc> yeah, it sort of sounds like "background" is disjoint and has nothing to do with the part where it says it runs in the current shell environment
[14:39:15] <emanuele6> yes, backgrounding always implies a subshell, so there is not really a point mentioning it
[14:39:35] <tirnanog> yeah. it's the subshell of the thing that may or may not, itself, have been a subshell. big deal.

[14:41:42] <chilversc> which now we've picked the current sentence apart, I think that's what its trying to say when it says "not in the background", its just having "not in the ... in the ..." makes it hard to infer the correlation between the two parts

[14:43:00] <chilversc> ah, wait so "not executed in the background" is the property? Now I get it
[14:43:17] <tirnanog> it could just say that it runs the last command of a pipeline in the current shell environment, rather than in a subshell environment, I suppose.
[14:44:14] <tirnanog> which is true.
[14:44:23] <chilversc> But there is an exception that if you have "foo | bar | baz &" baz would not be executed in the current shell environment, but what about bar? Does that now become the "last command not executed in the background"?
[14:44:56] <tirnanog> foo and bar are executed in subshells.
[14:45:47] <tirnanog> baz & is executed in a subshell, only because of the documented behaviour of &. the difference is that it is not one step removed from the original shell environment.
[14:46:03] <tirnanog> (where lastpipe is enabled)
[14:46:18] <chilversc> ok, now I do get it, but its still hard to read, maybe too many concepts condensed into a single sentence?
[14:46:21] <tirnanog> consider the difference between foo &, and ( foo & )
[14:46:23] <tirnanog> it's like that.
[14:46:58] <tirnanog> I think that's fair.
