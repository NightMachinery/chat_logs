[03:21:38] <nahstra> danke
[03:21:52] <[Coke]> that's not right. :)
[03:22:13] <[Coke]> m: my @a = <1 2 3 4 5>;  (@a.splice(2,3, <7 8 9>) && @a).head.say
[03:22:14] <camelia> rakudo-moar ab02205ed: OUTPUT: «1␤»
[03:22:27] <[Coke]> That works I feel it might not be nuanced enough.
[03:22:42] <[Coke]> (like maybe I made a mistake but it still worked.)
[03:23:13] <[Coke]> but, basically, since splice returns what you deleted, you need to force the part of the chain to pass along the array itself, not the result of the splice.
[03:25:59] <nahstra> right with the && 
[03:26:33] <[Coke]> honestly I'm surprised that worked. :)
[03:27:10] <[Coke]> m: my @a = <1 2 3 4 5>;  dd (@a.splice(2,3, <7 8 9>) && @a)

[03:27:24] <[Coke]> Yah, it seems to be doing the right thing.
[03:29:24] <nahstra> I should prob just split it up over a couple lines anyways '=D  just started learning an hour ago, raku is fun (y)

[12:26:58] <whatnext> Hi guys :)  So yesterday I was asking about this error while using Inline::Python: "Cannot find method 'EXISTS-KEY' on 'BOOTHash': no method cache and no .^find_method". I got disconnected before anyone answered. Does anyone know if there is any update on this? It seems to be a bit of a show-stopper for Inline::Python use?
[12:28:05] <lizmat> could you post a gist of the backtrace with the program running with --ll-exception ?
[12:28:06] <tellable6> 2021-11-03T22:33:01Z #raku <melezhik> lizmat - https://github.com/lizmat/IRC-Client/issues/65
[12:37:14] <whatnext> lizmat: I posted a gist with --ll-exception output some time ago: https://gist.github.com/whatnext/87c22a266f05d6f799ab5d2b01b610d3 - however, to work around the problem we have been moving "use" statements around, eventually gets the code to compile. However, it's a pain, and also it seems the error can resurface after almost any change, and then
[12:37:15] <whatnext> you are back to moving "use" statements around. If we can't find a fix for it, I think we are going to have to work towards eliminating the dependency - which would be annoying since that was one reason for picking raku in the first place
[12:39:55] <lizmat> could you re-run with rakudo at master?  and post a gist of that?  
[12:40:23] <lizmat> 2 reasons: I've refactored the code at INDIRECT_NAME_LOOKUP a bit, so that it hopefully will be able to provide more information
[12:40:55] <lizmat> and 2. there've been a lot of fixes in the past weeks
[12:41:30] <lizmat> the line number in your current gist doesn't match, so that's how I know you're running not on the latest :-)
[12:44:01] <whatnext> so you think a fix might have gone in? Ok I will do that and get back to you :)
[12:47:20] <nine> whatnext: please try adding "no precompilation;" to the module that has a "use Inline::Python;"
[12:48:43] *** Joins: evalable6 (eva-able@2001:41d0:2:5eb5::)
[12:53:58] <whatnext> nine: that doesn't seem to work unfortunately. I'll try building the latest version of rakudo and see if that helps (once I figure out how to do it!)

[20:39:41] <melezhik> I ended up spinning ztc proxy on my digital ocean droplet
[20:39:41] <lizmat> melezhik: so how did you fix / work around it ?
[20:39:55] <lizmat> ah. ok, hack around...  
[20:40:00] <melezhik> so that raku code talks to ztc proxy 
[20:40:27] <melezhik> and this one in turn is capable to implement SASL thing 
[20:40:49] <melezhik> yes, it's  a hack, but looks like right now I don't have any better option

[23:44:27] <lizmat> melezhik: that's not really a review now, is it ?
[23:44:51] <melezhik> yes, it's comment, as it says here
[23:45:15] <melezhik> oh, you mean if this is a real question or fake/test?
[23:46:42] <melezhik> actually it was my question ))) , I thought you read it before ... sorry if this a bit confusing ... I am just testing notifications against some old entries ...

[23:52:01] <melezhik> so yeah, heads up I am testing mybfio bot against OLD entries
[23:52:44] <melezhik> I can create new ones in my my dummy teddy-project as well, just thought someone would be interested to read old ones, in case they have not ))) 
[23:58:07] <melezhik> lizmat thanks for your reply, according to this - notifications work

[23:58:41] <lizmat> nice  :-)
[23:59:17] <melezhik> one can also use `@user` in any comment/reply and once a `@user` is logged they will see notification in dashboard
[23:59:59] <melezhik> I even thought to use GH logins in irc notifications, however IRC nicks NOT ALWAYS are the same as GH loginc
