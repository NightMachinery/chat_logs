[00:29:01] <Z-module> [itchyjunk]: I didn't understand your reasoning. The complex w with e^w = 1 are just all  2pi n i  (n in Z).  So e^(2z - 1) = 1 means 2z - 1 = 2pi n i  (n in Z) or  z = 1/2 + pi n i   (n in Z).  That's all you need.
[00:31:48] <Z-module> oh yeah, you got that same answer (though I wasn't sure how), and you should have omitted ln(1) in the process. Not wrong there, just peculiar.

[05:23:54] <gganbu> I must be really dumb or something
[05:24:32] <gganbu> How does C(2x-x^3) => C(x)(sqrt(2)-x)(sqrt(2)-x) = 0
[05:25:46] <meingtsla> I assume C is a constant and not a function? I smell a sign error somewhere.
[05:27:04] <gganbu> Yes, I am trying to determine if F := C(2x-x^3) if 0 < x < 5/2; 0 otherwise could be a pdf
[05:27:14] <gganbu> C is some constant
[05:27:15] <Z-module> I don't get what you mean by   C(2x - x^3)
[05:27:25] <Z-module> oh, you're factoring?
[05:27:27] <meingtsla> If you factor out an x, C(2x-x^3) becomes Cx(2-x^2). Then you can rewrite 2-x^2 as a difference of squares (sqrt(x))^2-x^2
[05:27:40] <meingtsla> Or sorry, (sqrt(2))^2-x^2
[05:27:48] <Z-module> your  =>   there should just be  =    That's what was confusing
[05:28:17] <Z-module> yes, this is using  A^2 - B^2 = (A + B)(A - B)  but where A = sqrt(2)
[05:28:56] <Z-module> also you made a mistake, gganbu, the first (sqrt(2) - x) there needs to be (sqrt(2) + x)
[05:29:17] <Z-module>    2 - x^2 = (sqrt(2))^2 - x^2 = (sqrt(2) + x) (sqrt(2) - x)
[05:29:32] <gganbu> yes, you're right I did make that mistake
[05:29:57] <Z-module> so the problem simply moves one factor of x to the left, and then uses the A^2 - B^2 on the remaining part

[05:31:47] <qergle> why does this factorization help determine if function could be a pdf?
[05:32:32] <Z-module> well, solving   C x (sqrt(2) + x)(sqrt(x) - x) = 0   is very easy
[05:32:51] <Z-module> if C is not 0, the solutions are just x = 0, sqrt(2), -sqrt(2)

[05:33:10] <Z-module> as for relevance to a PDF, that I can't say without more details
[05:33:18] <gganbu> we know 0 < f(x) < 1 for all x
[05:33:29] <qergle> gganbu: you just want to know that C must be -64/225
[05:33:49] <qergle> but you also have non-negativity. so can those two cohabitate?
[05:33:55] <gganbu> So, say 0 < x < sqrt(2) then Cx(2-x^2) > 0
[05:34:14] <gganbu> and if sqrt(x) < x < 5/2 then Cx(2-x^2) < 0
[05:34:23] <gganbu> So no one choice of C could make this a pdf.
[05:34:38] <gganbu> We'd need to address both intervals seperately.
[05:35:11] <qergle> why not just show C must be -64/225 and we have 2x-x^3 taking on positive and negative values on (0,5/2)
[05:35:24] <qergle> therefore C(2x-x^3) takes on negative values. no go.
[05:35:27] <gganbu> pdf can't take negative values
[05:35:55] <gganbu> How did you arrive at -64/225?
[05:36:33] <qergle> its integral must be 1, but this is superfluous, we already violated non-negativity, so getting C's must-be value is extra work you don't need.
[05:38:07] <qergle> you can just say whatever C's value is, (2x-x^3) takes on both positive and negative values over the interval of interest, therefore C(2x-x^3) does as well. therefore not a PDF.
[05:40:19] <gganbu> Is it clear that some clever choice of constant couldn't alter that?
[05:40:51] <qergle> yes, because C is either positive or negative (not both) [0 doesn't work because then you don't have integral of 1]
[05:41:24] <qergle> 2x-x^3>0 at x=1 and 2x-x^3<0 at x=2

[06:14:04] *** Quits: lind{at}yahoo (uid486956@tinside.irccloud.com) (Quit: Connection closed for inactivity)
[06:18:59] <nullbytes> Given an arbitrary number of points to create a polygram, I need to find the polygram with the maximum distance between points, ie: 5 points = (1 3 5 2 4), 6 points = (1 3 5) (2 4 6), 7 points = (1 4 7 3 6 2 5), 8 points = (1 4 7 2 5 8 3 6). Is there a general formula for calculating these sequences for other numbers of points?
[06:20:56] <Guest2990> oh gosh, sorry, I forgot to include the picture

[06:21:39] <Guest2990> from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_difference_method
[06:22:02] <somiaj> which part are you having trouble with?
[06:22:29] <int-e> nullbytes: so... the points are the vertices of a regular n-gon?
[06:22:33] <somiaj> the matrix is just putting the coefficents of the 9 terms f(x,y), f(x+h,y), f(x-h,y), ...
[06:23:10] <Guest2990> but when you apply the operator to a function, say, f(x,y), then \Delta_h f= what
[06:23:35] <Guest2990> like I don't understand what the point of writing the coefficient matrix
[06:23:35] *** Joins: Stalevar (~stalevar@user/stalevar)
[06:23:54] <Guest2990> idk maybe i'm overthinking this
[06:24:09] <somiaj> But you understand how to write the second derivative as a lmiit of the Delta_h u(x,y) part?
[06:24:19] <nullbytes> int-e: yes. Given n, I need to find the sequence of vertices for the shape that is the furthest left on this chart: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/20/Regular_Star_Polygons-en.svg
[06:25:06] <int-e> nullbytes: wouldn't (1 5 2 6) (3 7 4 8) be better for 8 points?
[06:25:17] <Guest2990> I understand how they used the Taylor expansion
[06:26:00] <somiaj> Guest2990: did you follow the link to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stencil_(numerical_analysis), all the matrix does is provide a nice way to understand the coefficent needed for each near by point (above/below/right/left/center)
[06:26:34] <Guest2990> oh
[06:26:41] <somiaj> so if you understand the Delta_h u(x,y) = 1/h^2 * (....), the matrix is just a stencil to help keep track of the various coefficents, and here I don't think is being used as a traditional matrix
[06:26:45] <Guest2990> I thought I was meant to "multiply" the matrix somehow with u
[06:26:53] <somiaj> note, I don't know that much about this, but this is what I get from what you share
[06:27:26] <Guest2990> do you by chance also know what the "consistency" means?
[06:27:42] <somiaj> in this same context, or in terms of mathematics in general?
[06:27:57] <Guest2990> in this same context
[06:29:10] <nullbytes> int-e: What I'm really looking for is a sequence 1 to n where the numbers are spaced as far apart as possible.
[06:30:29] <somiaj> Guest2990: not quite sure, but I think it means that the approximates do converge to the true values
[06:30:40] <Guest2990> mm mm
[06:30:57] <somiaj> so they will be the conditions for which these approximations do converge and provide reasonable values.

[06:37:10] <int-e> nullbytes: if you just want those star shaped things, that's easy, you pick connect the points 1 and ceil(n/2), and pick all n rotations of that line segment. That'll give you a polygon for odd n and n divisible by 4, and 2 polygons for n divisible by 2 but not by 4.

[06:49:24] <nullbytes> int-e: Is there an algorithm for finding the optimal shape for a given number of points?
[06:49:51] <int-e> Heh. Brute force is an algorithm.
[06:52:31] <int-e> Note I have not even fully checked whether those two examples are optimal. The right one is, since it always alternates between the main diagonal and a next shorter one, and you can't use the main diagonal twice in a row.
[06:55:00] <int-e> But the middle one... I have not ruled out that you can use a shorter diagonal once and get a larger total length.

[06:58:16] <int-e> nullbytes: There's some hope that one can find recipes for optimal solutions for all n, but these things usually become quite tedious to work out. Some n are easy of course... odd n always produce a star, for example. And the right solution generlizes to the case that the number of points is divisible by 8.

[07:41:17] <brownorange> blueberrycrop, what formal system are you working in
[07:41:32] <W> incompleteness is not just provable, but proven
[07:42:02] <brownorange> @W from assumptions
[07:42:04] <blueberrycrop> I heard someone did 1000 pages and did like 1 + 1 proof in there somewhere
[07:42:31] <W> brownorange, very reasonable assumptions that we use for everything else we use mathematics for too
[07:42:52] <cherim> https://www.dpmms.cam.ac.uk/~ardm/inefff.pdf to define 1
[07:43:12] <brownorange> @W sure but mathematics as it is
[07:45:10] <brownorange> @blueberrycrop 1 is the successor of 0. 1 + 1, is the successor to 1. you might define as 2. from there you could waste your life coming up with equalities,
[07:46:03] <brownorange> 2 is the only even prime iirc,that might be worth. 1 + 1 = only even prime
[07:46:22] <W> Well as suggested before, if you wish to probe the foundations of mathematics, see which axioms you can cut and which you can replace, you might want to have a look at the work others have done in that area before you. Probably will have to, for years, if you wish to advance the field.
[07:48:21] <brownorange> @W so some clever informal argument won't ever quite cut it?
[07:48:56] <brownorange> i think i agree, since there's no intuitive examples for Godel's own theorems.

[07:52:38] <blueberrycrop> doesn't 2 have a limit without getting to absolute infinite
[07:55:18] <brownorange> no idea depends on your assumptions
[07:55:32] <brownorange> maybe you should look at set theory
[07:56:15] <Galois> There's no such thing as a "1+1 proof". Perhaps you mean the proof that 1+1 = 2?
[07:56:47] <Galois> There exist various (bad) choices of mathematical foundations under which it takes 1000 pages to prove 1+1 = 2. Nobody uses those foundations anymore.
[07:57:11] <Galois> There also exist (even worse) choices of mathematical foundations under which the definition of 1 requires 10^17 characters
[07:57:14] <brownorange> @Galois give me an example, a riddle, anything that's intuitive
[07:57:28] <Galois> The nineteenth busy beaver number is provably uncomputable.
[07:58:25] <Galois> Naturally, nobody uses those (even worse) choices of mathematical foundations.
[07:58:35] <brownorange> so you believe there are statements about that beaver number, that must therefore be unprovable?
[07:59:00] <Galois> brownorange: if you literally don't know what I'm talking about, then you have no right to continue in this conversation as if your beliefs matter
[07:59:13] <Galois> If you use any sane choice of mathematical foundation, it's very easy to say what 1+1 is, or to prove theorems such as 1+1 = 2.

[08:02:48] <brownorange> or is that your point
[08:03:47] <Galois> that question doesn't make sense. It's wrong on several levels. BB(19) isn't a proposition; hence cannot be equivalent to any proposition. A statement about the value of, or computability of, BB(19) may be a proposition.
[08:04:14] <Galois> the continuum hypothesis isn't "independent of math altogether"; it's independent of ZFC, and ZFC does not equal math

[08:14:02] <Trigo> Hi I have a 3D line that I want to constrain one end to a y level. It has a position and a rotation, I want to limit the rotation so the end-point never goes lower than the y level. Any ideas how to accomplish this?
[08:14:02] <Galois> ok, look, this is a big project. You can go at this one of two ways. One is to do everything yourself from scratch. It will be painful, it will be a lot of work, you'll be reinventing the wheel, you'll be learning a lot of lessons from scratch that everyone else has already learned. If you want to do this, fine. But I don't see you putting in the work that would be needed.
[08:14:47] <Galois> you would need to be doing actual examples, formulating actual, precise conjectures, giving proofs, in many cases failed proofs, asking for feedback and advice on your examples, your proofs, and your conjectures.
[08:15:00] <Galois> I'm not seeing any of that. If you're doing it, it's not on IRC.
[08:15:07] <blueberrycrop> Galois yes
[08:15:10] <blueberrycrop> I was gonna say that
[08:15:24] <Galois> The other option is to go look up what other people have actually done. You haven't done that either.
[08:16:18] <brownorange> I have a proof that 2 * 2 = 2 + 2
[08:16:36] <Galois> has anyone validated your proof?
[08:16:53] <blueberrycrop> it would be cool
[08:17:01] <brownorange> https://pastebin.com/avbnMv93
[08:17:27] <blueberrycrop> what you're looking for is certainty
[08:17:32] <blueberrycrop> and that's quite a big "if"
[08:17:48] <Galois> ok, now here's my proof: Goal 2 * 2 = 2 + 2. Proof. reflexivity. Qed.
[08:17:56] <Galois> and my proof has been validated, in Coq
[08:18:44] <brownorange> look at lines 396 through 408  for 2+2=4, the next proof's first line shows that 2*2 = 2+2
[08:18:55] <Galois> I saw your proof. It actually looks decent.
[08:19:34] <brownorange> i invented two successor functions for special reasons. but if you look past that, it should be solid
[08:19:38] <Galois> What I'm trying to say is, we have tools that can help you along. If you don't want to use them, if you want to do it from scratch, then it's going to be long and hard and error-prone. That's a valid choice by the way. You learn a lot more doing everything yourself. But it's a tradeoff.
[08:20:40] <brownorange> inputtijng this into a theorem verify would take a while
[08:20:57] <Galois> no it wouldn't. I literally just did the proof of 2 * 2 = 2 + 2 for you.
[08:21:01] <blueberrycrop> I guess try not to be too caught up in "certainty"

[08:23:34] <Galois> blueberrycrop: in Coq's formal system, 1 + 1 = 2 (or 2 * 2 = 2 + 2 for that matter) is quite easy to prove. We know a lot more about how to make good foundations today than we did 50 or 100 years ago.
[08:24:15] <blueberrycrop> ok and what method is that?
[08:24:26] <brownorange> i'll look into it. i'll probably use metamath though. Coq is my understanding much more fancy. i still need to prove there are infinitely many primes. and i'm not sure any verifier has my notion of forall
[08:24:35] <Galois> 50 years ago we had Bourbaki, and 100 years ago we had Principia Mathematica. Those formal systems were the ones that I referred to above as the two "wrong choices"
[08:25:09] <Galois> if you're asking about the proof, it's simply "reflexivity."
[08:25:21] <Galois> if you're asking about the formal system, it's CIC (calculus of inductive constructions)
[08:26:59] <brownorange> Can Coq can automatically generate consistency and completeness proofs for a formal system?

[09:16:28] <Trigo> Ah ok
[09:17:18] <Trigo> How would the math for that work?
[09:17:50] <Decker> not really sure what the input arguments are... is the line like the x-z plane?
[09:18:07] <Trigo> Y is up and down
[09:18:37] <Decker> so the direction vector is a unit normal vector? Or can be normalized?
[09:18:44] *** Joins: ua_ (~ua@public-gprs224058.centertel.pl)
[09:19:02] <Decker> the arccos(Y) of the normalized direction is the angle (from Y up) that the line is...   (0 is up)
[09:19:24] <Decker> horizontal is 90- angle to up
[09:21:30] <Trigo> I'm not sure what the question is, could you rephrase? (I'm so sorry It's very late and I'm very stupid)
[09:21:34] *** Joins: jamtorus (~quassel@185.213.154.161)
[09:22:16] <Decker> know what a unit-normal vector is?  it's where xx+yy+zz=1
[09:22:51] <Decker> or a vector/||vector||  where ||vector|| is it's length
[09:23:19] <Trigo> Is that where the vector is limited to a scale?
[09:23:40] <Decker> sorta?
[09:23:48] <Decker> it makes the limit of the length 1
[09:24:14] <Trigo> Ok yes I understand
[09:24:17] *** Quits: ua_ (~ua@public-gprs224058.centertel.pl) (Excess Flood)
[09:24:41] <Decker> right - so the angle the direction is over the plane is just the Y of the unit-normal direction

[09:25:03] <Decker> (arcsin(y)) ... then when it's ON the plane it's 0... so that's just the angle.
[09:25:16] <Decker> and again- the offset doesn't matter - so what is it you really want?
[09:25:18] *** Joins: ua_ (~ua@public-gprs224058.centertel.pl)
[09:27:10] <Trigo> I want to be able to set the rotation so the end of line won't be below the other line
[09:27:43] <Decker> ... so you can just set y=0 and re-normalize the x/z componen
[09:27:49] <Decker> so it's still in a circle on that plane
[09:27:55] <Decker> and re-scale by the length
[09:28:39] <Decker> if X+Z == 0 then pick any aribitrary value as x,0,z
[09:28:53] <Trigo> Umm ok, I think I understand
[09:28:54] <Decker> (that is the line war perpendicular - and you don't really have any sort of direction on the plane)

[09:43:07] <greenbagels> Guest2990: whats up
[09:44:50] <Guest2990> I'm supposed to calculate the "local truncation error" of the 5-point stencil of -Delta u = 2pi^2 sin(pi x)sin(pi y), where Delta is the Laplacian. I don't really quite understand what local truncation error means
[09:45:24] <Guest2990> I've played with the Taylor series and have written the difference equation for the Laplacian
[09:48:43] <Guest2990> Here is how I wrote the Laplacian https://i.imgur.com/qXlqQpi.png
[09:49:47] <Guest2990> so.. i mean in my head this "local truncation error" means the error we get from examining the exact solution and the difference approximation
[09:52:33] *** Joins: kakuhen (~kakuhen@user/kakuhen)
[09:54:06] <damo22> from memory, if you have a solution for the equation as a taylor series about 0, the local truncation error can be estimated by some coefficient times the next order term in your series that you missed
[09:54:45] <damo22> so you "truncate" the taylor series and your error is the next term
[09:55:42] <damo22> and the error gets bigger the further away you are from the expansion point
[09:56:52] <damo22> if your solution is a periodic function, the taylor series with a finite number of terms is just a polynomial right, so it gets really bad at the end
[09:57:23] *** Quits: mawk (~mawk@wireguard/contributor/mawk) (Ping timeout: 264 seconds)
[09:57:39] <Guest2990> no, that is not what is meant in this context
[09:58:13] <Guest2990> its the difference of the exact solution and the difference approximation. My issue is that I don't understand how to copmute this difference

[10:00:10] <damo22> when you run out of terms in the difference approximation, the rest of the terms come from the exact solution and thats your difference?
[10:01:45] <Guest2990> I don't know the exact solution
[10:02:39] <damo22> maybe you have to find it first
[10:03:16] <Guest2990> maybe. Hopefully someone who knows about this will chime in

[18:44:35] <mawk> imagine you have your method to invert the multiplication by a vector, you could apply it to (0, …, 0, 1, 0, …, 0) to recover the coefficients of the inverse matrix
[18:44:58] <mawk> my argument isn't very good though
[18:45:07] <mawk> I'm not convinced anymore myself
[18:46:37] <savask> ESphynx: If you have a specific matrix and a specific result vector, isn't it just like solving a system of linear equations?
[18:46:45] <savask> So Gauss method would do
[18:46:59] <mawk> which amounts to inverting the matrix
[18:47:00] <ESphynx> savask: i seem to be reading something like that yes...
[18:47:07] <ESphynx> that's what I'm wondering ;)
[18:47:23] <savask> mawk: I mean, he never said the matrix was square
[18:47:30] <ESphynx> the matrix is square
[18:47:36] <ESphynx> 4x4
[18:47:49] <mawk> well he talked about inverse
[18:47:57] <savask> Indeed
[18:48:16] <ESphynx> so is there a faster way than doing the full inverse?
[18:48:48] <mawk> if you do the Gauss method, you're computing the inverse at the same time
[18:48:50] <savask> ESphynx: Are you just lazy to do a 4x4 matrix or it's being used in some sort of program idk
[18:48:58] <mawk> so it's not faster
[18:49:15] <ESphynx> savask: yes 3D engine stuff... saving cycles
[18:50:03] <savask> Hmm
[18:50:05] <mawk> you're computing a list of transformations such that when applied to the matrix it becomes the identity; so applying this list of transformation to the identity matrix would give the inverse; and you can do this in parallel to doing it to the vector

[20:26:30] <Z-module> For cardinals mu and nu, we define the cardinal power  mu^nu  to be |{all functions nu -> mu}|.  "2" here means {0,1}, so 2^|X| means |{all functions X -> {0,1}|, which trivially = |Pow(X)|.

[21:10:57] <cuppajoeman> 2^(aleph_0) = | { f | f: A -> {0, 1}, where |A| = aleph_0 } | ?
[21:12:12] <cuppajoeman> "{all functions N -> N} -> {all functions N -> {0,1} }" How can we make such a bijection Z-module
[21:13:08] <Z-module> The first is |{all functions aleph_0 -> aleph_0}|, same as |{all functions N -> N}|.   2^(aleph_0) is |{all functions N -> 2}| where "2" means the set {0,1}, though any 2-element set works.  "c" is just another name for this cardinal, the cardinality "of the continuum" (hence the letter c). R is the set of reals, whose cardinality is c.  Pow(N) is the set of all subsets of N, and for any set X at all, there's a simple bijection  {all
[21:13:08] <Z-module> functions X -> 2} -> Pow(X), so  2^|N| = |Pow(N)|.
[21:14:26] <Z-module> The only even mildly nontrivial thing in all of that is showing that there is (by writing one down) a bijection {N -> N} -> {N -> 2}.  That is, give a function taking any map from N -> N, giving back a map N -> {0,1}, in a bijective way.
[21:14:41] <cuppajoeman> there's a simple bijection  {all functions X -> 2} -> Pow(X), so  2^|N| = |Pow(N)|. (I think I've seen this one, we you use the indicator function to say whether it's a part of X or not)
[21:14:52] <Z-module> right
[21:14:52] <cuppajoeman> Yeah, that's the part I'm thinking about now
[21:15:52] <Z-module> riv, what were you thinking aleph_1 is up there? That's not definitely 2^(aleph_0) unless you assume the Continuum Hypothesis.
[21:16:07] <Z-module> It's merely the first uncountable cardinality.

[21:17:18] <Z-module> (Contrary to a claim of impossibility of such by Dugundji in his famous book "Topology" -- I wish I could've informed him of that error when he was alive; I bet bunches of people actually did so, back then)
[21:17:23] <riv> I think the Continuum Hypothesis is true?
[21:17:37] <Z-module> OK riv, you're free to do so.
[21:17:38] <riv> is this not generally assumed as an axiom
[21:17:41] <Z-module> It's not.
[21:17:47] <riv> ok, I shall be more precise
[21:17:49] <Z-module> It has a lot of *strange* consequences.
[21:21:00] <Z-module> I think my favorite, actually equivalent to CH, is this:  Some function phi: R -> R  exists so that the plane R^2 is a countable union  ( F_1 cup F_2 cup ... ) cup ( G_1 cup G_2 cup ... ),  where each F_n is a plane translate of the graph of phi, and each G_n is a plane translate of that graph rotated by pi/2 radians.  Notice how totally impossible this is if phi is continuous.

[21:23:16] <Z-module> riv, you might have had in the back of your mind that the CH is actually true for all closed or open subsets of R^n (in fact, with more proof work, for all Borel subsets). So if B is any uncountable borel set of reals, then there's a bijection R -> B.

[21:45:53] <Z-module> as nice/simple a one as possible, that doesn't just start with an injection (those are trivial to describe) and then say "now use that injection, along with the inclusion map in the other direction, and weave those together by Schroeder-Bernstein to get a bijection."

[21:47:14] <johnkeats6> well g : N --> {0, 1} is very directly equivalent to subsets of N. so if there is a nice bijection, there should also be a reasonably nice bijection between N -> N and P(N)

[21:56:42] <rex-> johnkeats6: if there supremums do?
[21:56:49] <mawk> each f_k is in N, and if you re-express it in binary you can make it a sequence like (110010, 110100001, 10000100)
[21:57:02] <mawk> which is exactly an element of {0; 1}^N

[21:57:30] <rex-> johnkeats6: or in this case it should even be the maximums
[21:57:47] <Z-module> rex-: I don't remember how to do that. I do know that under just the norm ||f||_infty, it's not complete.
[21:57:55] <mawk> or if you do it with the argument of Z-module, a sequence of N^N can be mapped to just N using various diagonal methods, and that single element from N can be expressed in binary as well
[21:58:01] <rex-> Z-module: that's the next exercise :)
[21:59:10] <mawk> but in general any infinite countable set is in bijection with any other cuppajoeman, if I remember correctly
[21:59:16] <johnkeats6> ||.||_infty norm gives uniform convergence. so i think the non-completeness is because you can have f_n --> f uniformly, with f_n differentiable but f not (like you could form a crease easily)
[21:59:22] <mawk> so if they don't ask for an explicit bijection you can say it exists
[21:59:44] <johnkeats6> but it's a classic analysis thing that if the derivatives also converge to some function, then that function is the derivative of the original limit
[22:00:05] <johnkeats6> so your norm should be uniform convergence of the function + uniform convergence of the derivatives

[22:45:44] <harwiltz> somiaj: Oh ok, that's sorta weird. So every point not in X is only equivalent to itself, and every point in X is equivalent to every other point in X?
[22:46:19] <somiaj> harwiltz: https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/127786/is-a-subset-of-a-topological-space-able-to-induce-a-quotient-space
[22:46:28] <harwiltz> Ah, thanks
[22:46:36] <somiaj> harwiltz: yea, basically you are turning this invariant subset into a single point
[22:47:00] <somiaj> and leaving everythign else along. So that is what I think of as the standard equivlance relation created by a subset
[22:47:06] <harwiltz> Right... I guess that makes sense
[22:47:29] <harwiltz> I guess I just don't really understand what's interesting about that, but maybe the problem will make it more clear
[22:48:00] <somiaj> well what is it's conclusion, does it talk about the operator on this quotient space?
[22:48:21] <harwiltz> somiaj: Yeah. It says if K is compact on H, then K is compact on H/X.
[22:49:07] <harwiltz> Now that I think of it, that actually seems pretty intuitive...
[22:49:41] <somiaj> Probably would need to prove a few more properities, but to me it sounds like they are showing that if you have an invariant subspace, you can think of that subspace as a single point and the operator on this new quotient space still has similar properities
[22:49:55] <harwiltz> Right
[22:49:56] <somiaj> but yea, closed is probably what makes the compact work
[22:50:01] <harwiltz> True
[22:50:06] <harwiltz> Thanks a lot somiaj!

[22:53:42] <lok91> Hi. This is from my textbook: https://imgur.com/a/vzV1iap - I don't really understand the steps and reasoning in the red box. They lost me there... could you elaborate?
[22:55:19] <Guest299> https://i.imgur.com/Nm5BJWe.png Comparing with this https://i.imgur.com/dD5YbY8.png can someone help me understand how to use the definition of the local truncation error?
[22:58:14] <somiaj> lok91: d/ds ( B . B ) = dB/ds . B + B . dB/ds = 2 B . dB/ds -- so since B.B = 1, 2 B . dB/ds = d/dt(1) = 0, or B . dB/ds = 0

[23:01:51] <OverCoder> here's me fitting 44 of these rectangles inside the circle
[23:01:51] <lok91> somiaj Thanks!
[23:01:58] <OverCoder> both the left and right circles have 44 rectangles inside
[23:02:06] <OverCoder> I wonder if I could optimize for more rectangles inside
[23:02:16] <OverCoder> doesn't seem possible but maybe someone knows something
[23:02:22] <lok91> somiaj That was very helpful, but that was only the first part, right?
[23:02:32] <lok91> What happens with the differentiation?
[23:02:40] <lok91> Just below?
[23:03:12] <lok91> I don't really follow the steps, when they differentiate B.
[23:03:51] <somiaj> I'm not quite sure why dT/ds = kappa N, but outside of that NxN = 0 since that is true for any vector with a cross product
[23:04:56] <somiaj> though I guess dT/ds = kappa N kinda makes since, since you can write a vector as a sum of its parallel and vertical component
[23:04:57] <cuppajoeman> Not sure where to start with this one https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/EdCynmTa/image.png
[23:05:22] <somiaj> but since T is a unit vector, its parallel component is always constant, so dT/ds must be parallel to its vertical component, which is N
[23:05:57] <lok91> They use kappa to denote the curvature, if that helps
[23:06:06] <cuppajoeman> If we have f,g being continuous it meansfor any open set V of Y, we have f^-1(V) and g^-1(V) are both open sets of X
[23:06:18] <somiaj> lok91: here it doesn't really matter what kappa is, just that dT/ds is parallell to N.
[23:06:27] <lok91> Yeah
[23:06:37] <lok91> But maybe the curvature has some specific useful properties?
[23:07:16] <somiaj> lok91: it does, I just don't quite recall what now.
[23:08:22] <lok91> This is their definition of curvature: https://imgur.com/a/kB4qTrz
[23:08:47] <somiaj> yea that is fairly normal.
[23:09:02] <somiaj> and clearly shows why dT/ds = k(s) N
[23:09:15] <somiaj> since k(s) is defined to be the magnitudue of the vector, and as I mentioned it has to be parallel to N
[23:09:25] *** Joins: notzmv (~zmv@user/notzmv)
[23:09:28] <lok91> Oh
[23:10:01] <somiaj> then even define the unit normal there, so you could also use that.
[23:10:34] <lok91> Maybe I should try to write down what you just explained to me :P
[23:10:35] <harwiltz> somiaj: Sorry to bug you again. Now I'm not sure what the metric on H/X would look like. What could the distance between a point in X and a point not in X be?
[23:11:31] <lok91> B . B == ||B||^2, right? Maybe that can be used?
[23:12:06] <harwiltz> First I was thinking, if d is the metric on H, x in X and y not in X, then the distance in H/X between y and {x} is inf_x d(x, y). But X is not necessarily compact, so this metric is not well defined.
[23:13:12] *** Quits: ferdna (~ferdna@user/ferdna) (Quit: Leaving)
[23:13:14] <somiaj> harwiltz: you can always define the distance to a set, d(a,X) = inf{ d(a,x) : x in X }
[23:13:38] <somiaj> I think since X is closed, you can say there exists x in X such that d(a,X) = d(a,x)
[23:13:53] <somiaj> I think closed is enough here in a hilbert space (I know this works for compact, think it also works for closed)
[23:13:55] <harwiltz> somiaj: don't you need compactness for that?
[23:14:03] <harwiltz> Oh ok. I'll look into that
[23:14:36] <somiaj> well maybe you do need compactness to state there exists x in X such that d(a,X) = d(a,x), but I think closed is enough
[23:14:58] <harwiltz> somiaj: right, because I don't think I actually care if that x exists
[23:15:14] <somiaj> just take a sequence of x_n in X such that d(a,x_n) -> d(a,X)
[23:15:14] <harwiltz> Either way the distance in the new topology will be <= the distance in the old topology

[23:15:51] <somiaj> if x_n has a limit, then it has to be in X, and satsifies the property you want, so I think you need closed + the space is complete

[23:20:19] *** Joins: magic_ninja_work (~sparkie1@4.4.16.52)
[23:20:45] <somiaj> harwiltz: yea, it looks like closed isnt' enough in general, but I think being a hilbert space, this gives you additional properities.
[23:21:25] <harwiltz> somiaj: This stuff is so sneaky... but I feel like the purpose of the problem isnt to define a metric though. It looks like the metric should be implied.
[23:21:50] <somiaj> harwiltz: I'm to use to thinking about R^n, which it is true, basically because you can find a closed and bounded subset of X, which is then compact and things work nicely.
[23:21:51] <harwiltz> But also, I think as long as the distance in H/X doesn't exceed the distance in H, it should work out
[23:22:24] <harwiltz> And with the inf formulation, the distance in H/X is definitely <= distance in H
[23:23:52] *** Quits: mei (~mei@user/mei) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[23:24:22] <somiaj> yea, defining the distance between a point and a set works in any metric space, though I think you have to be careful to ensure the distance you define on the quotient space actually makes it a metric.
[23:24:40] <somiaj> Here I think you need that if a is not in X, then d(a,X) > 0, which works since X is closed.

[23:52:24] *** Joins: Crescendo (~Crescendo@user/crescendo)
[23:52:42] <somiaj> harwiltz: correct, so you need to start with a sequence in the quotient space, which you don't.
[23:52:57] <harwiltz> Also the use of K does suck, but that's what my prof wrote (as in he uses K:H -> H and K:H/X -> H/X)
[23:53:12] <somiaj> harwiltz: start with h_k, create g_k from h_k, and then use g_k to show h_k also has a convergent subsequence.
[23:53:18] *** Joins: bowlofeggs (~bowlofegg@fedora/bowlofeggs)
[23:53:38] <somiaj> harwiltz: Yea, I would still use a different symbol, maybe K_Q or something like that
[23:53:43] <harwiltz> Oh I see. But it seems like it would be really easy to prove that a bounded sequence in H corresponds to a bounded sequene in H/X, no?
[23:53:54] *** Quits: seninha (~seninha@user/seninha) (Ping timeout: 258 seconds)
[23:54:12] <somiaj> sure, but again it feels backwards, you need to start with a bounded sequence in H/X and relate it to a bounded sequence in H.
[23:54:12] <harwiltz> Ah. That's probably where we need the inf stuff actually
[23:54:27] <harwiltz> Thanks for all the help, much appreciated
[23:54:49] <somiaj> well I would just say if h_n has an infinite number of x's in it, we are done, so assume h_n only has a finite number of x's
[23:55:12] <harwiltz> Right. But even that case is easy once you start with a bounded sequence
[23:55:16] <somiaj> then first create a subsequence where you throw the x's out, then go to g_n which isn't even inside of X
[23:55:25] <harwiltz> Yeah
[23:55:46] <somiaj> so I think your proof is in a good direction, it just feels backwards to me
[23:55:51] <harwiltz> But actually, why do we even need to prove that the sequence is bounded in H/X? We say it's bounded by assumption, no?
[23:55:58] <somiaj> correct
[23:56:11] <harwiltz> Ok so I just have to reorder things?
[23:56:48] <somiaj> I would, start with a sequence in the quotient space, use it to find a sequence in the original space, find a subsequence that converges, go back to the quotient space, show the subsequence converges there too
[23:57:04] <harwiltz> Right, makes sense

[23:57:33] <harwiltz> But I guess my point is, it doesn't matter if X is closed or if H isn't a Hilbert space, it just needs to be a metric space

[23:58:19] *** Quits: magic_ninja_work (~sparkie1@4.4.16.52) (Ping timeout: 244 seconds)
[23:58:27] <somiaj> but that is because you need H/X to be a metric space to even have a notion what a 'bounded sequnce' means
[23:58:45] <harwiltz> Yeah it needs to be a metric space, but not necessarily a Hilbert space
[23:58:55] <somiaj> yea, just a metric space is enough
[23:59:06] <harwiltz> Right, and X could be any subset of H
[23:59:09] <somiaj> and you have a clear distance function, just need to show it is a metric
[23:59:21] <somiaj> well it has to be closed
[23:59:31] <somiaj> otherwise you'll have d(a,x) = 0 with a != x
[23:59:50] <somiaj> having a distance function vs a metric here
