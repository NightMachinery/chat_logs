[16:14:34] <operational> fuck crowdstrike :(
[16:15:48] <shlomif> operational: hi, what did they do?
[16:16:00] <operational> caught me, i think
[16:16:25] <operational> if i see that falcon agent on a box it's like.. don't even run solitaire on this box or they'll get ya
[16:16:49] <operational> so good tool i guess, just a pain in my butt
[16:19:45] <shlomif> operational: klondike solitaire is fairly challenging to write solvers for. Freecell is in general easier
[16:20:05] <operational> :/
[16:20:14] <TheLinuxNerd> solitaire is not always winnable
[16:22:57] <TheLinuxNerd> it's not really a game of skill
[16:23:14] <TheLinuxNerd> winning depends upon getting a solvable deck

[17:22:17] <Joanna> There are certain techniques to win solitaire
[17:25:36] <Joanna> By giving priority to the larger stacks of cards
[17:26:51] <TheLinuxNerd> solitaire games use such solvers to ensure the deck is winnable
[17:27:14] <TheLinuxNerd> before giving it to the user to avoid getting the user frustrated LOL
[17:27:49] <Joanna> You can also play with a deck of cards
[17:28:10] <Joanna> I can win most games of solitaire if not all
[17:29:31] <Joanna> Unless itâ€™s one of those games that doesnâ€™t let you have access to every card in deck

[22:11:07] <Hash> Well
[22:11:10] <Hash> I feel like an idiot
[22:11:27] <Hash> No matter how many times I go over hub vs switch vs router vs layer2/3 switches
[22:11:33] <Hash> I always end up forgetting everything
[22:11:51] <Hash> What layers they work at, which one sends all frames, or which one is only certain ports etc.
[22:11:53] <Hash> omg!
[22:12:32] <Hash> Hub is physical, it sents everything eveywhere
[22:12:42] <Minall> Hub dumber switch, which is dumber that routers, these three are the 'core' Hash
[22:12:43] <Hash> Switchi is data link, as it work one higher on MAC
[22:12:50] <Minall> Not sure about layer 2/3 switches though
[22:12:54] <Hash> router is network layer since it does ip adressing
[22:13:26] <Minall> hub link layer so, only broadcasting
[22:13:35] <Minall> What about layer2/3 switches Hash?
[22:13:47] <Hash> So, if you have 10 computers, you connect them all together using a hub and ethernet cables
[22:14:03] <Hash> You can't address any one particular computer, can you?
[22:14:05] <Hash> Or how do you?
[22:14:12] <Hash> What identifies that machine?
[22:14:16] <Hash> Same question about a switch
[22:14:19] <MadCamel> hub just parrots out any frame it sees through every port except the one it came in on. layer2 switch figures out which port to send the frame to by mac address. layer3 switch figures out where to send the packet by IP address and therefore qualifies as a simple router.
[22:14:28] <Apachez> a hub will just electrically put everything in the same collission domain
[22:14:35] <Hash> On router you get ips and stuff, on switch it uses the packet's MAC addres
[22:14:42] <Hash> I see.
[22:14:42] <Apachez> a switch (l2 switch) will have one collission domain per interface
[22:15:04] <Apachez> a l2-switch will forward frames based on destinaion mac address
[22:15:15] *** Joins: allorder (allorder@user/allorder)
[22:15:15] <Apachez> a l3-switch (aka router) will forward packets based on destination IP address
[22:15:22] <Hash> oh, l3 is router.
[22:15:25] <Apachez> l2/l3 comes from the OSI layer definition
[22:15:30] <Hash> I see. Words get confusing. Thanks guys
[22:15:38] <Apachez> then you can argue what is the difference between a router and a l3-switch
[22:15:50] <Hash> How do you have VLAN on a switch without ip addressing?
[22:16:04] <Apachez> generally speaking a "router" can often deal with various l1 protocols except for ethernet also sdh, wifi and what not
[22:16:07] <Hash> I'm confused about that
[22:16:13] <Hash> Allow connections to multiple devices, manage ports, manage VLAN security settings <- switch
[22:16:13] <Apachez> while a "l3-switch" often can "only" do ethernet
[22:16:35] *** Joins: tent405 (~tent405@107-214-50-180.lightspeed.bcvloh.sbcglobal.net)
[22:16:37] <Apachez> but desicion wise a router is the same as a l3-switch, they both forward PACKETS based on dst ip
[22:16:37] <Hash> Doesn't virtual LAN stuff require ip addressing?
[22:16:46] <Apachez> na
[22:16:55] <Hash> How do you make vlans out of mac addresses only?
[22:16:56] <Apachez> VLAN is just virtualized (segmented) mac address tables
[22:17:00] <Hash> oh.
[22:17:01] *** Joins: boB_K7IQ (~boB_K7IQ@152.44.147.180)
[22:17:04] <Apachez> you can configure an ip address for a vlan interface
[22:17:04] *** Joins: plasticuproject (~plasticup@user/plasticuproject)
[22:17:05] <Hash> I misread perhaps
[22:17:18] <Apachez> then the device will automatically start to route traffic between all vlans it got an ip configured for
[22:17:25] <Hash> I see. So VLAN functionality is in switches and it's not a route feature?
[22:17:32] <Hash> routers don't use vlans, they use subnets iirc
[22:17:37] *** Joins: yans (~yans@2a02:8388:4504:1780:b5be:e9d1:8106:a961)
[22:17:46] <Hash> See, this is a bit confusing until I get all the parts down
[22:18:02] <Apachez> sometimes you might see "l2-vlan" or "l3-vlan" which basically means l2-vlan = you got a vlan configured but not ip configured for that vlan so your device will act as a l2-switch and just forward within that vlan based on dstmac
[22:18:11] <Minall> Actually, I have one question regarding this, the layer 3 can use IP AND MAC right?
[22:18:23] <Apachez> where l3-vlan is vlan with an ip address configured meaning the device will act as a router and happily route anything sent to its ip interface
[22:18:36] <Apachez> technically layer3 is ip and layer2 is mac
[22:18:39] <Hash> I see, thank you
[22:18:47] <Apachez> ethernet and ipv4 (and ipv6) are the most common ones
[22:19:03] <Hash> Ok, I'm gonna go through the layers on my own, don't type me or correct me yet!
[22:19:03] <Apachez> arp is being used with ethernet to glue ip and mac
[22:19:18] <Apachez> so in ipv4 world you got both ethernet frames + arp frames
[22:19:29] <Hash> Physical, data link, network, transport?, something, something, application
[22:19:33] <Hash> Fudge, I forgot.
[22:19:34] <Apachez> while in ipv6 world you only have ethernet frames (with ipv6 as protocol id)
[22:19:58] <Hash> oh session and presentation
[22:20:02] <Hash> Word.
[22:20:18] <Apachez> aka ethernettype
[22:20:32] <Minall> Are you gonna tcp/ip or osi layer?
[22:20:33] <Hash> What's an example of presenetation layer guys?
[22:20:43] <Apachez> some say OSI is a bit legacy/ancient because it doesnt perfectly map anylonger
[22:20:48] <Hash> I gotta know 7 layers of osi, and the 4 layers of tcp
[22:21:05] <Apachez> the lower levels are easy to explain... the L5 and upwards are tricky and merges together
[22:21:06] <Hash> it's what the course work says so I gotta do it :)
[22:21:07] <Minall> Hash the data you received is encrypted, receiving it will be the part when you decrypt it, to send it, the presentation layer encrypts it
[22:21:14] <Hash> ahhh
[22:21:17] <Hash> Gotcha. Thanks
[22:21:31] <Apachez> L1 = physical layer, like tp-cable, fiber, wifi, cabletv etc
[22:21:36] <Apachez> L2 = ethernet, src/dstmac
[22:21:45] <Apachez> L3 = IPv4 / IPv6, srcip/dstip
[22:21:54] <Apachez> L4 = udp/tcp port
[22:22:28] <Hash> Hmm. transport layes opens/closes ports? I didn't know this
[22:22:30] <Apachez> L5 = ?, L6 = ?, L7 = application itself (ultrasurf, gmail, facebook etc)
[22:22:38] <Minall> Apachez in what way won't it fit?, isn't just TCP/IP but longer?. BTW Apachez, Ethernet is a physical medium so it should be on the physical layer, in L2 in place of ethernet you meant MAC
[22:22:53] <Hash> yeah
[22:22:58] <Hash> I think he means ethernet frames
[22:23:01] <Hash> possibly
[22:23:06] <Apachez> Minall: because it gets a bit moshy above L4
[22:23:14] <Apachez> L4 is udp/tcp ports so thats easy
[22:23:19] <Apachez> and then L5 is like http/ftp/ssh?
[22:23:26] <Minall> I see
[22:23:33] <Apachez> wtf is l6 then if L7 is like gmail, facebook, bittorrent etc?
[22:23:33] <Hash> The transport layer manages the delivery and error checking of data packets. It regulates the size, sequencing, and ultimately the transfer of data between systems and hosts. One of the most common examples of the transport layer is TCP or the Transmission Control Protocol.
[22:23:33] <Minall> Like yeah, it is the protocol and all
[22:23:53] <Hash> What's the diff in presentation layer vs app layer?
[22:23:57] <Apachez> and then you have the directors cut of L8 and above which is mgmt directors, financial department, money, bribing etc :P
[22:23:58] <Minall> Hash ye
[22:23:59] <Hash> seem like they should be the same
[22:24:16] <Hash> The presentation layer formats or translates data for the application layer based on the syntax or semantics that the application accepts. Because of this, it at times also called the syntax layer. This layer can also handle the encryption and decryption required by the application layer.
[22:24:24] <Hash> And application layer:
[22:24:24] <MadCamel> l7 is generally considered protocol level. like we're talking on IRC, that's l7. or http.
[22:24:26] <Hash> At this layer, both the end user and the application layer interact directly with the software application. This layer sees network services provided to end-user applications such as a web browser or Office 365. The application layer identifies communication partners, resource availability, and synchronizes communication.
[22:24:29] <Apachez> again the OSI doesnt perfectly match
[22:24:36] <Apachez> where do you put VXLAN or MPLS in that? :P
[22:24:38] <Minall> Hash presentation would just say: is the data readable?, if not, decrypt it and pass it to the app layer... If the app layer wants to send something, encryption would happend on presentation
[22:24:48] <Hash> I see
[22:25:08] <Minall> Apachez true
[22:25:13] <Hash> What about the duplex... ness of these devicxes
[22:25:22] <Hash> half vs full duplex and whether that matterws
[22:25:25] <Apachez> duplex is down at the physical layer
[22:25:32] <Apachez> but you got duplex also at L4 level if you wish
[22:25:39] <Apachez> tcpmux for example :)
[22:25:40] <Hash> hub is half, switch is both maybe, and router is full
[22:25:43] <Hash> i see
[22:25:44] <Minall> Hash imagine an encrypted JSON, it can't be readed by the application data if it isn't properly decrypted on presentation
[22:26:01] <Hash> Minall: I see. So prsentation layer is a logic layer
[22:26:06] <Apachez> and even if you got a session with L1 -> L4, you still can have another session at L7
[22:26:09] <Hash> and appolication layer is the actual presentation layer
[22:26:16] <Hash> they stupidly named them goofily and now it's confusing.
[22:26:22] <Minall> Apachez good point, session always confused me a lot
[22:26:40] <Apachez> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model
[22:26:41] <Minall> Hash presentation would be: encryption - decryption layer
[22:26:50] <Hash> php login session_start() function
[22:26:55] <Hash> Where does this function work?
[22:27:03] <Hash> Which layer?
[22:27:18] <Apachez> https://www.bmc.com/blogs/osi-model-7-layers/
[22:27:32] <Apachez> Hash: in reality you dont care what layer it operates in
[22:27:42] <Hash> I see
[22:27:50] <Apachez> OSI is legacy but good to know since its often refered to as in layer1, 2, 3, 4 and 7
[22:28:01] <Hash> That's a good page
[22:28:02] <Hash> thanks
[22:28:07] <Apachez> layer2 means switching meaning device looks at dstmac and forwards (if its ethernet)
[22:28:11] <Hash> https://community.fs.com/blog/do-you-know-the-differences-between-hubs-switches-and-routers.html
[22:28:13] <Hash> I was reading this one
[22:28:19] <Apachez> layer3 means routing meaning device looks at dstip and routes
[22:28:22] <Apachez> etc
[22:28:30] <Apachez> layer1 is the physical cable
[22:28:35] <Hash> I think after all this public talk and mulitple times reading
[22:28:35] <Apachez> layer4 = ports
[22:28:40] <Hash> I think I got it
[22:28:43] <Hash> Ask me some questions
[22:28:43] <Apachez> layer7 = the application
[22:28:52] <Apachez> Hash: why is the sky blue?
[22:28:53] <Minall> You got me thinking with the PHP example
[22:29:06] <Hash> That's because of the air and how light hits the atmosphere
[22:29:17] <Hash> Something something physics
[22:29:23] <Hash> something something somethind darkside
[22:29:37] <Minall> A good example of presentation - application is an image, it isn't encrypted but, you have to show them graphically in the application for it to mean something to the user
[22:29:50] <Minall> Gotta go
