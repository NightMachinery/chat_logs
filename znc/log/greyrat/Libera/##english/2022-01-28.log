[06:40:04] <anders_bk> Hi there! to say "I'm talking about something" is unusual in "american" english? I see that the Merriam Webster definition of 'about' verses more concerning the vicinity of something, rather than 'the subject of'.
[06:40:43] <TimMc> I don't think that's specific to AmE.
[06:40:56] <LjL> "talking about" is of course fine
[06:41:04] <TimMc> Consider: "It's a show about dolphins."
[06:41:12] <TimMc> That's the same meaning of "about".
[06:41:32] <TimMc> something like "with reference to" or "on the subject of"
[06:41:45] <LjL> it can also be used in ways like "it's about a mile", or "we're about there", not sure if that's what you mean by vicinity, but one use doesn't exclude the other
[06:41:46] <anders_bk> ok. Thanks!
[06:42:29] <LjL> wiktionary also gives
[06:42:29] <LjL> Over or upon different parts of; through or over in various directions; here and there in; to and fro in; throughout. [First attested around 1150 to 1350.][2]
[06:42:29] <LjL>     Rubbish was strewn about the place.
[06:42:29] <LjL>     The children were running about the room.
[06:42:29] <LjL>     He was well known about town.
[06:42:37] <LjL> that's also "in the vicinity of something"
[06:42:46] <LjL> it's a meaning i can recognize but that i don't use often
[06:42:51] <anders_bk> yes, Merriam Webster defines the word much like "it's about a mile", or "we're about there", and so forth.
[06:43:31] <LjL> okay, but while i'm not sure if that's American-specific (i don't think so, but i don't know) the meaning of "on the subject of" is universal, so you can definitely "talk about" something in any English
[06:45:28] <anders_bk> :)  Thanks a lot to you all. Solved.

[12:24:35] <kompowiec> quite possibly so. Out of context, English is a conglomerate of words that mean somehow (such as "set" which has over 400 meanings).

[19:28:24] <CuriosTiger> First off, not all Americans are the same.
[19:29:25] <CuriosTiger> As an EXTREMELY rough generalization, an American who's 70 won't understand what emoticons mean, an American who's 50 and technically inclined may use them, an American who's 30 will probably prefer emoji.
[19:30:01] <kompowiec> that's true, but it's hard not to generalize when talking about a nation in general. For example, Poland is said to be hospitable, which does not mean that everyone will be there.
[19:30:35] <CuriosTiger> but technical skills differ, settings differ (for example, people on IRC are far more likely to understand emoticons) and settings differ (for example, emoticons are appropriate in an email to your friend, not so much in a formal letter.)
[19:30:57] <CuriosTiger> kompowiec: And this is why they say, tongue-in-cheek, that generalizations are always wrong.
[19:31:15] <CuriosTiger> A generalization I might apply to Poland is that Poles don't speak English well.
[19:31:30] <CuriosTiger> but to Poles who grew up in the past 20 years, their English is excellent.
[19:31:37] <kompowiec> especially that poles don't have "an" grammar case :)
[19:31:48] <CuriosTiger> and some Poles who grew up in the 60s and 70s speak excellent German.

[19:41:09] <kompowiec> To exercise (authority or influence) effectively.
[19:41:11] <CuriosTiger> Basically, it's a word that means "using".

[19:44:43] <TimMc> ("Brandishing" also has a specific legal meaning that doesn't quite match common usage.)
[19:47:45] <TimMc> I think that even just unholstering a gun or even just showing that you have one in an attempt to intimidate is "brandishing" in a legal sense.

[19:51:03] <CuriosTiger> That's how I would differentiate those four.
[19:51:13] <looney> Well, of course legal jargon is always different, they tend to exaggerate matters. For example, a burp in legalese is called "unauthorized carbon emission"
[19:51:15] <CuriosTiger> although my definition of brandishing does not entirely match the legal one
[19:51:31] <CuriosTiger> Legally, you can be "brandishing" a gun if you are showing someone your gun as a threat, even if you don't point it at them.
[19:51:49] <CuriosTiger> looney: What about when you had permission to burp?
[19:51:51] <TimMc> Yeah, legalese can be very weird.
[19:52:06] <CuriosTiger> Would that be a carbon emission with prior sanction?
[19:52:24] <CuriosTiger> (I love how "sanction" can mean "permission" as well as "punishment" in legalese.)
[19:56:35] <looney> I can barely understand legalese in my own language, let alone in English. It's a different language after all, bureaucracy is such a complex matter that I've been trying to spell "bureaucracy" like ten times, then I decided to just copy and paste it from the dictionary

[20:21:50] <CuriosTiger> Sure.
[20:22:11] <CuriosTiger> I'm just referring to spelling here. Pronunciation in English is only loosely related. :P
[20:22:46] <CuriosTiger> Others with ei include "eight" and "neighbor"
[20:23:37] <looney> I was just thinking of the "ei" words with an E sound like weird, wield, yield, wiener...
[20:23:53] <CuriosTiger> weird and wield don't rhyme.
[20:24:11] <CuriosTiger> wield rhymes with shield. Or field.
[20:25:16] <looney> yeah, they don't rhyme but are supposed to have the same phoneme for the vowel, at least in most dialects AFAIK
[20:25:20] <huf> sword and sward are particularly evil
[20:25:24] *** Quits: GuiToris (~GuiToris@user/guitoris) (Quit: Sieben Acht Gute Nacht!)
[20:25:30] <huf> but that's not a vowel thing
[20:25:39] <CuriosTiger> huf: So are sew and sow.
[20:25:45] <huf> oh god those
[20:25:56] <CuriosTiger> or coach and couch
[20:26:28] <CuriosTiger> or bow and bow. :-)

[20:28:19] *** Joins: yaru (~Fabia@net218-37-245-109.mbb.telenor.rs)
[20:28:19] <looney> iron and irony are also problematic, especially if everyone in your country (including English teachers) pronounce "iron" incorrectly
[20:28:41] *** yaru is now known as m00nl1ght
[20:29:11] <looney> by "your country" I meant mine, or any non-english speaking country
[20:29:11] <CuriosTiger> Just show them Scottish soda to set them straight.
[20:29:35] <CuriosTiger> Scotland has a soda called "Irn-Bru"
[20:29:53] <CuriosTiger> which is the local phonetic spelling of "iron brew", obviously.
[20:31:20] <CuriosTiger> looney: "iron" is common enough that I learned it early on, although one word that I had a hard time when I was first starting to learn English was "wire".
[20:31:47] <CuriosTiger> (in Norwegian spelled "vaier".)
[20:32:03] <m00nl1ght> i had so much trouble with "the"
[20:32:14] <CuriosTiger> I was like...fine, the E is silent, but why does "i" represent TWO SYLLABLES?
[20:32:37] <CuriosTiger> "the" was ok for me, although Norwegian does not have the th sound. However, "three" was a veritable tongue twister.
[20:33:33] <CuriosTiger> th on its own, no problem. r on its own, no problem, although American R is weird and British R was very confusing.
[20:33:40] <CuriosTiger> but combine the two? Hoo-boy.
[20:34:29] <m00nl1ght> yea spoken english us hard, I still speak it like I have stone in my mouth
[20:34:47] <looney> everything about languages was traumatic for me, because I probably speak one of the few languages in the world that are actually pronounced the way they are written
[20:35:05] <m00nl1ght> me too lol
[20:35:47] <CuriosTiger> I've gotten used to it, but a couple of words trip me up still, including taking the wrong kind of bow or wondering who the football couch is <-- yes, I know it's football coach. I don't confuse the words in writing, but I sometimes mess up the pronunciation.
[20:36:07] <m00nl1ght> which language tho? mine is serbian, and the rule for "alphabet" is one letter - one sound
[20:36:30] <CuriosTiger> m00nl1ght: That's most languages, although in many, some exceptions creep in over the years

[20:37:30] <CuriosTiger> One I learned in Serbian, for example, is that c represents ts, and lj represents just j (consonantal 'y' to English speakers)
[20:37:35] <looney> you know what is a good way to practice speaking? Recording sentences. It might be audio messages, or youtube videos, whatever. You can repeat and correct a sentence as much as you want, before confirming
[20:37:52] <CuriosTiger> so the name Ljubice, I would've spelled Jubitse if I was going with phonetic spelling.
[20:38:52] <m00nl1ght> yea that's true, and it cyrillic we have a letter for lj - љ
[20:39:28] <CuriosTiger> m00nl1ght: However, most languages have spelling systems that fairly closely correspond to pronunciation. The biggest exceptions I'm aware of are English and French. (I'm not counting Chinese and other logographic writing systems.)
[20:40:00] <CuriosTiger> m00nl1ght: In pronunciation, that letter corresponds to Latin J -- in most languages except for English.
[20:40:31] <CuriosTiger> J represents a "yu" sound in every other Germanic language, although Dutch ALSO uses it to represent a diphthong.
[20:41:03] <m00nl1ght> it makes sense
[20:41:19] <CuriosTiger> It also works that way in Slavic languages that use the Latin alphabet, although sometimes with an extra letter to differentiate it from other uses of J. Like in the Slovenian city of Ljubljana.
[20:41:21] <looney> my language is considered among the easiest in the world. It's Italian. I don't know why, but it's probably because of its pronunciation. The only thing that is missing in written Italian is the main stress on the words. All the rest is plain and simple
[20:41:39] <CuriosTiger> looney: Italian pronunciation is fairly easy. Italian grammar, however, can be confusing.
[20:42:22] <CuriosTiger> Like, there are so many tenses. And which auxiliary verb am I supposed to use with which main verb?
[20:42:38] <CuriosTiger> avere or essere?
[20:42:52] <looney> That's a problem in every romance language as far as I know
[20:42:58] <pussipupu> how many tenses?
[20:43:02] *** Joins: magla (~gelignite@55d49292.access.ecotel.net)
[20:43:12] <pussipupu> and are you counting aspect as tense?
[20:43:13] <CuriosTiger> looney: Not Spanish. It's always haber
[20:43:57] <CuriosTiger> pussipupu: I'm just illustrating that Italian also has aspects that are difficult for non-native speakers to figure out, even though the spelling system is pretty logical and phonetic.
[20:44:14] <looney> yeah, lots of tenses, but many are not used at all, or very rarely
[20:44:16] <jemius> What word would commonly be used to say more roughly that you and your friends are going to go drink some beers. "We're boozing tonight"?

[21:11:57] <LimeOn> hey looney, as spanish speaker i can understand almost everything in italian, you cannot understand spanish?
[21:12:25] <LimeOn> i mean, some words are almost the same, but there is some "changes", like ñ for gn , there is no j(g instead i think)
[21:12:49] <LimeOn> of course i did not consider myself capable of speak it, but at least i can read it, without much practice
[21:13:50] <kompowiec> grammar is intuitive for me because Polish is closely related to Latin.
[21:14:15] <LjL> uh no it's not
[21:14:24] <LjL> not any closer than english
[21:15:35] <LjL> CuriosTiger, some italians use "stare" the way you'd use it in spanish, but it's dialectal. we do have some isolated expression like "sto bene"

[21:28:19] <LjL> kompowiec, it *is* with a space in latin

[21:28:41] <LjL> English uses tons of those but it's not "closely related" to Latin at all

[21:29:29] <LjL> also, "nota bene" is literally "nota bene" in italian
[21:29:50] <LjL> well Spanish *is* closely related to Latin
[21:30:10] <LimeOn> you could say,even, that is based in latin somhow
[21:30:27] <LimeOn> because it is a romance language, so they share a lot of things
[21:30:32] <LjL> that's what "related" means in linguistics

[21:31:11] <LjL> two languages are related if they are part of the same family, one of the possibilities being one descending from the other. what became Spanish was originally just a spoken variety of Latin
[21:31:22] <LimeOn> looney: you could try to read some news in spanish. You will be amazed about the amount of simmilar words that you will understand
[21:31:27] <LjL> Polish and Latin *are* actually related, but only in that they are both Indo-European (descended from PIE)
[21:31:41] <LjL> but other than that, they are from the Italic and Slavic subfamilies so quite separate
[21:32:07] <LimeOn> well, i tried to disntiguish related from based since some languages have taken some concepts from latin, but they are not related in the proper sense of the word
[21:32:22] <LimeOn> And that was what you explaind LjL,i think
[21:32:38] <looney> LimeOn, yeah, written language is definitely easier, but that also  applies to English. I can even understand mumble rap songs in English if I read the lyrics! LOL
[21:33:06] <kompowiec> yeah and it's intersting, that although Polish has a different branch, it still seems easy to understand for me

[23:22:14] <wodes> <blkshp> Hello new, I'm dad.
[23:22:18] <wodes> Omg, you didn't.
[23:22:29] <blkshp> Yeah but when it's a question, I kind of expect the person to wait a couple of minutes to see if there's follow up/
[23:22:34] <blkshp> wodes: non./
[23:22:58] <wodes> Please, this is an English language discussion group :3
[23:23:15] <jemius> In scientific literature, would you write "The next chapter shows how.." or "The next chapter will show how.."?
[23:23:16] <blkshp> But I.. boss :P
[23:23:29] <blkshp> Either is fine.
[23:23:35] <wodes> Both are correct
[23:23:37] <blkshp> The former probably a bit better.

[23:29:02] <LimeOn> jemius: 
[23:29:42] <blkshp> jvega_bgn: I was mostly kidding.
[23:31:59] <jvega_bgn> I'm new to everything, to irc, to the english language
[23:32:02] <jvega_bgn> etc
[23:33:18] <blkshp> Ok. So, basically this channel is to help people with their English or, somewhere to go where English is spoken properly (so please capitalise the word English! :D)
[23:37:17] <jvega_bgn> Ok, ok, thanks this will be very helpful

[23:50:44] <LimeOn> just in case, you know
[23:51:03] <blkshp> "People use it in the lounge"

[23:56:45] <wodes> Cookies
[23:56:52] <wodes> Oh my bad it was kurahaupo
[23:56:54] <wodes> I'm tired T.T
[23:57:08] <blkshp> Did you not have your 3 hours lunch today ;)
[23:57:50] <kurahaupo> blkshp: s/hours/hour/ ← adjectives don't have plurals
[23:57:51] <chat> kurahaupo thinks blkshp meant to say: Did you not have your 3 hour lunch today ;)
[23:58:12] <blkshp> You're incorrect.
[23:58:17] <blkshp> Come to England you'll lose :P
[23:58:48] <blkshp> Think "3 hours worth of lunch"
[23:59:06] <kurahaupo> that's "3 hours' worth"
[23:59:20] <wodes> It's a three hour lunch
[23:59:31] <kurahaupo> wodes: ++
[23:59:33] <blkshp> Don't make me call you something starting in "dog" :P
[23:59:41] <wodes> Checkmate blkshp
