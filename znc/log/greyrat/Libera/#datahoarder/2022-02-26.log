[03:16:31] <ThePendulum> I gave one like it to my sister so they could connect their security camera at the same time as their Playstation 
[03:16:42] <joepie91> yeah it's def plastic fantastic
[03:16:56] <joepie91> indeed reviews on tweakers state that it's pretty much antigravity
[03:17:04] <joepie91> but nothing a bit of tape won't fix
[03:17:05] <ThePendulum> apparently they couldn't work out how to connect it even after I told them to just plug every network cable into it, so it's been in a cupboard for months

[03:18:08] <joepie91> oof
[03:18:48] <ThePendulum> I think they also unplugged it because they have the same problem connecting socket strips, so it didn't record to SD either

[20:22:49] <joepie91> Hawker: Discord is not a government, it's not like it needs any pretext to kick out people
[20:22:57] <joepie91> so that line of reasoning doesn't hold here
[20:23:27] <Hawker> joepie91, it does for PR reasons. 
[20:23:46] <joepie91> their existent reputation suggests otherwise
[20:24:26] <Hawker> So if discord kicks out people they don't like, it'll generate bad PR, but if they make an announcement saying it's for getting rid of pedos (which they are known for) it'll be seen as a plus... even though it's the same garbage

[20:24:28] <joepie91> look, I don't like Discord, I don't personally use it because I do not trust it, but trying to find some hidden agenda in a policy chance that has obvious reasons is a whole different ballgame
[20:24:33] <joepie91> change*
[20:24:55] <joepie91> it's a Trump clause
[20:25:53] <joepie91> specifically, an obvious response to the "oh yeah they are nazis but they are not being nazis *on this platform*" rule lawyering

[20:32:08] <skye0> in other news, trying to decide if i should go get an rtx 2070, again. gonna take a nap, got chores to do in a day i wanted to relax in but i don't need to go out any more unlike tomorrow
[20:32:18] <Hawker> hmm
[20:32:28] <Hawker> What would you use it for?
[20:33:44] <skye0> need more frames in halo infinite and need CUDA (don't really want to say why). current frame rates with halo infinite on lowest settings (including resolution) for a map like streets gives me 40-50 fps with a bit more stuttering than i'm comfortable with

[20:34:15] <skye0> been recommended an rtx 3060 but none available on ebay. too lazy to deal with amazon and i don't think availability may be so good with local suppliers but i'll check
[20:35:03] <skye0> my wallet's gonna cry because some of these will be over my 400 GBP planned max budget
