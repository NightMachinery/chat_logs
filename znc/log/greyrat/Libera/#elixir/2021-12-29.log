[17:10:19] <rawtaz> :D
[17:20:32] <whk> a significant portion of the indentation processing happens trying to figure out how to identify blocks for the stab_op. Apparently it is so slow that there is a PR to just give up indentation for more performance.
[17:22:39] *** Quits: Tlangor (~tangmang@159.196.132.214) (Remote host closed the connection)
[17:23:22] <rawtaz> is this parsing done entirely without elixir? is there any way you could just use elixir language server instead? see eg. https://youtu.be/ydjx2kKHzrM?t=970 for examples of similar features
[17:23:34] <josevalim> whk: if it helps, the way Elixir handles it is by seeing if the first thing after a `do/end` is a `->`. if so, everything after a `->` is indented
[17:23:57] <josevalim> whk: a `->` can only appear immediately  after `do` or immediately after a `(`, nowhere else
[17:25:24] <Nicd> `else foo -> bar end` seems to contradict that, so probably I didn't understand what you meant
[17:26:09] <whk> rawtaz: i am trying to improve the default experience in emacs for elixir devs without having to add a bunch of stuff. with lsp, treesitter etc.. it works much better. it does not have to be perfect, but just slightly more usable. 
[17:28:29] <whk> Nicd: yeah, don't think that syntax is valid. it is specified in the current grammar, but should not be there.

[17:51:32] <whk> we are working with a weak partial parser essentially generating s-expressions forwards and/or backwards. the current code adds tokens for match blocks delimiters so to feed it into a bnf rule... which works, sort of. but just moaning at this point :p

[17:58:08] <josevalim> Only those scenarios which you might be abluente look ahead

[19:43:30] <whk> josevalim: when i am at the end of a line i am looking forward to see if the next line has the stab_op, then I inject a delimiter between matches. pretty close to how it was, but with less computation. i don't really see any other option with the smie parser in emacs as we need a delimiter to get all the benefits. 
[19:44:01] <whk> looking back at do's and fn's is probably more expensive. but thanks again for the help. 
[19:56:15] <josevalim> whk: hrm, what about this: parse the contents of do/end as if `left -> right` is a binary operator. then traverse the body of do/end once to build the nesting of `left -> right`
[19:56:56] <josevalim> so the first time you will parse it like this:
[19:57:01] <josevalim> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/88XqEG2l/
[19:57:10] <josevalim> then you traverse and group it to this:

[20:03:09] <whk> it is not just about indentation, it is also about identifying the expressions and enable them to work as expected in emacs for movement commands, which was the original reason why I started tinkering.
[20:08:02] <whk> in emacs you can press "Ctr-2 Ctr-Alt-k" to kill the next two blocks, or "Ctr-Alt-f" to move to the end of the block. In this case i want to be able to kill two matches and the two systems work from the same grammar unless you add exceptions. adding exceptions makes it harder to maintain.
[20:08:29] <whk> so slightly more complex. 
[20:09:20] <whk> i am delimiting full expressions by ";" as well, which is pretty standard i think
[20:10:05] <whk> if you are looking for a real challenge after aoc ;P https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/SMIE.html
[20:10:38] <whk> the current code: https://github.com/elixir-editors/emacs-elixir/blob/master/elixir-smie.el
[20:24:39] <whk> Matz mostly maintains emacs ruby-mode version which is pretty good, so missed it when moving to elixir.
