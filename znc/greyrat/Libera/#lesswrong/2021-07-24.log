[00:15:28] <shawwwn> Actually I guess it’s not illegal as long as we’re similar ages
[00:15:55] <shawwwn> Though the law is still pretty vague about that
[00:16:42] <ggreer> I've heard of that trick but it definitely doesn't work for me
[00:17:32] <kuudes> is that "flexing your muscle" some sort of innuendo on masturbation?
[00:17:58] <shawwwn> I have no idea tbh
[00:18:20] <shawwwn> But I’m not sure they have any idea either
[00:18:32] <gwern> I've never noticed any kind of flexing helping divert blood flow, and I'm not sure that's even how penis blood pressure works... the only thing that works for me is visualizing extremely offputting stimuli like someone vomiting
[00:18:33] <shawwwn> I’m just wondering where he heard about it.
[00:18:59] <gwern> 'I feel like I should add to this. The flexing muscle strat doesn't instantly work (at least for me, maybe I'm doing it wrong), it takes a minute or so.' <-- although I don't think I've ever tried a full minute, that's a long time. I'll stick with visualizing
[00:19:05] <shawwwn> Off putting for you maybe. Every time I get a boner I visualize you vomiting
[00:19:25] <saturn2> it doesn't work, it's a weird thing people endlessly repeat on reddit

[00:23:19] <shawwwn> Speaking of offputting stimuli, I fell asleep listening to Star Trek and had a dream about Twitter getting super pissed at a furry artist for creating scat porn. The artist got really depressed and wanted to kill themselves. Someone went to captain Picard and said that he had to do something, and to stop it. But he said the prime directive applies and that he has no jurisdiction here
[00:24:01] <shawwwn> I woke up wtf’ing, and it turns out that the episode where troi’s mom meets that 60yo was playing. He’s expected to kill himself at 60
[00:24:11] <gwern> picard's right, as always. the natives must be free to chose their own preferred degeneracy

[00:36:49] <gwern> dbohdan: ah. I definitely don't follow nyx enough to know that

[00:47:10] <shawwwn> why yes, I have, and I sure could use one right about now
[00:47:22] <linear> twitter's video upload/processing is very bad
[00:47:47] <gwern> shawwwn: you are probably running into the colorspace issue
[00:47:55] <shawwwn> ah
[00:48:02] <gwern> shawwwn: twitter can only eat videos in a very restricted set of codec options
[00:48:10] <shawwwn> the only thing I can think of is to explode the mp4 into individual frames, and then use my png-to-gif script which always seems to work
[00:48:24] <shawwwn> but I haven't written a script to explode an mp4 yet
[00:48:42] <gwern> shawwwn: so it's like, 'yuv420p' is fine but 'yuv421fulol' is bad and they look frigging identical visually and in all the settings for video tools
[00:48:44] <pompolic> all this to have twitter convert it back to an mp4
[00:48:52] <shawwwn> apparently it's ffmpeg -i inputfile.avi -r 1 -f image2 image-%3d.jpeg
[00:49:10] <shawwwn> png-to-gif happens to be a misnomer. it spits out an mp4 :)
[00:49:21] <pompolic> ah
[00:49:52] <gwern> checking my bash history, it seems I settled on 'ffmpeg -i $MP4 -c:v libx264 -profile:v high -level:v 4.2 -pix_fmt yuv420p -c:a copy out.mp4'  as the magic incantation for a video that'd work on twitter without being *too* large
[00:50:42] <gwern> so, x264 but not x26*5* codec, and yuv420p colorspace as opposed to the default PNG colorspace, iirc

[01:01:45] <gwern> at a guess, moviepy is so widely used it just defaults to compatible options. have you tried dumping the format information with like ffmpeg or moviepy and seeing what the difference between working & nonworking videos are? I bet it's x264+yuv420p
[01:02:17] <dbohdan> shawwwn: FFmpeg can convert to animated GIF directly: `ffmpeg -i input.mp4 output.gif`
[01:03:22] <shawwwn> yes but png-to-gif happens to spit out an mp4 when you specify output.mp4 :)

[01:03:54] <dbohdan> Ah, okay

[01:54:26] <Betawolf> huh. I guess I've not seen this anime. If it pulls this sort of stuff it might be fun.
[01:54:51] <Obormot\Arcturus> No, it's actually terrible, and Endless Eight was egregious absurdity
[01:55:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> (But many people like it, and by "people" I mean "irredeemable weebs")
[01:56:05] <gwern> EE was reasonable to watch the first and second episodes. the first to know what happens, and the second to say, "wow, they really did redo *all* the animation, it's not a copy with a few cels tweaked. they really did just light that pile of cash on fire. wow. how about that." and then skip #3-8 because it's literally the same thing but animated by different teams
[01:57:52] <spxtr> I went in to EE totally without knowing what was coming and I was bewildered and offended

Now *that* would be impact! We need to do something that's never been done before---otherwise, there's no point in doing this at all!" He started going off about this and just wouldn't back down. The rest of the staff...
[02:00:47] <gwern> ...turned to Kazumi...Even then, she was famous for her ability to control him. "Well, if you really wanna do something no one's ever done before", she began, "why don't you have a shit-eating contest instead? You want impact? *That's* impact." Okada didn't say another word, and the "pussy proposal" was thankfully laid to rest. That, however, wouldn't be the last time Okada chimed in with...
[02:00:53] <gwern> ...some insane suggestion. After that, every one of his wild ideas was answered with the chant, "Shit-eating contest... Shit-eating contest..."'

[02:23:07] <Obormot\Arcturus> I got a recipe for an "easy apple-cranberry cake" from Serious Eats, which indeed seemed easy enough. But it seemed to me like the batter had too much sugar in it, and I knew from experience that this was often the case, so I mentally reduced the sugar by 25%
[02:23:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> ... but while adding the sugar to the batter, I *ran out of sugar*
[02:23:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> It ended up being less than 2/3rds of what the recipe said, sugar-wise
[02:23:44] <Obormot\Arcturus> ... and the cake is still more than sweet enough!
[02:24:49] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Also, Serious Eats pulled an Amazon on me and removed the recipe from their site, and now links to it ... don't 404 or anything, but silently go to a different recipe)

[03:55:16] <catern> I've discovered that my main software philosophy can be nicely summed up as "Reduce, reuse" - perform reductions on new problems to turn them into known already-solved problems, and reuse existing solutions. it would be great if I could complete the slogan with "recycle" or at least another word starting with "r", any suggestions?
[03:56:03] <adiabatty> probably not a good word, but: 'refine'?

[05:55:48] <gwern> with feynmann, the books aren't the original, they're merely the final
[05:57:31] <catern> the final?

[05:58:02] <catern> ah
[06:04:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> Let us look backwards to this essay, written in the distant past of 2017: https://srconstantin.wordpress.com/2017/08/08/the-craft-is-not-the-community/
[06:04:29] <Robomot> The Craft is Not The Community | Otium (Epistemic status: argumentative. I expect this to start a discussion, not end it. “Company culture” is not, as I’ve learned, a list of slogans on a poster.  Culture consists of th…)
[06:04:44] <Obormot\Arcturus> "I think institutions like sharehouses and alloparenting and homeschooling are more practical and humane than typical American living arrangements; I want to raise children with far more freedom than traditional parenting allows; I believe in community support for the disabled and mentally ill and mutual aid for the destitute.  I think runaways and sexual minorities deserve a safe and welcoming place to go.  And the Berkeley
[06:04:44] <Obormot\Arcturus>  community stands a reasonable chance of achieving those goals!  We’re far from perfect, and we obviously can’t extend to include everyone (esp. since the cost of living in the Bay is nontrivial), but I like our chances. I think we may actually, in the next ten years, succeed at building an accepting and nurturing community for our members." [emphasis mine]
[06:04:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> How is that prediction looking these days

[06:11:15] <nshepperd2> they have certainly nurtured 'something'
[06:13:15] <catern> dear lazyirc, is there a good more-cultured alternative word for "subtweeting"? like the thing that Obormot and nshepperd2 are doing right now, implying some bad thing and criticizing it but not openly saying what it is
[06:20:27] <Ralith> I think that's called being passive aggressive?
[06:20:34] <Ralith> unless you mean something specific they're doing on twitter right now
[06:20:48] <catern> no haha I just meant those messages
[06:38:54] <saturn2> there might be a more functional group that we never hear about because there's no drama
[06:41:06] <saturn2> they probably aren't trying all that hard to provide support for the destitute and mentally ill though

[07:06:56] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: I think the problem there was that they got the accepting down, but then the nurturing couldn't keep up
[07:07:23] <shawwwn> (after all, gwernqueue sent me https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Do1fN_isFx8&ab_channel=ohsshoot earlier, which is clearly fake)

[07:10:48] <shawwwn> ever since realizing that anyone can slap "AI created ..." on anything, real or not, it sadly ruined those for me
[07:11:19] <shawwwn> it's one reason I like GANs more than language models

[07:15:48] <TheWhisper> I was AI created

[07:15:56] <TheWhisper> computer educated
[07:17:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: No doubt that was part of it... but also: Sarah is right that if you're trying to accomplish something, you have to reject some people, but what she doesn't mention (or realize?) is that if you want to nurture people, you *also* have to reject some people
[07:17:22] <gwern> TheWhisper: in CPU I spent all my days
[07:18:30] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: yeah. this is why silicon valley works: because technical stuff serves as a filter. *because* so few people can, say, write a regexp engine in CSS filters, pg can afford to give them advice in the hopes of pay it forward
[07:19:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> True, though it's not just "keep the numbers manageable", it's also "some people are net negative"
[07:19:30] <gwern> without that costly signal (cheap to future SV techies, but oh so expensive to everyone else) of capability, it'd just all break down and pg would have to turn off his email and twitter, say
[07:20:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> Both in the sense of "they can't be helped and if you try to help them you'll just spend inordinate resources on them, i.e. they are utility monsters" and - as the Bay Aryans famously keep discovering - ALSO in the sense of "some people will actively harm the rest of your community, e.g. by doing sexual abuse or trying to murder people or who knows what"
[07:20:42] <gwern> someone emails me asking for a podcast. fuck that, everyone and their dog has a podcast, you don't even need to buy a mike these days. I may not even dignify that with a rejection. someone emails me a colab notebook using TWDNE and asks a question - I'll answer it and even add it to my pages as relevant

[07:24:39] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Some rationalists have created successful startups and many more have successful careers in the tech industry — but these are basically never “rationalist endeavors”, staffed exclusively by community members or focused on serving this community.  And they shouldn’t be. If you want to build a company, you hire the most competent people for the job, not necessarily your friends or neighbors." ... also, I feel like this
[07:24:39] <Obormot\Arcturus>  whole part of Sarah's argument evades the real question
[07:25:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> Which is: the whole *point* of the rationalist project was that rationalists were supposed to end up *being* the most competent people for the job
[07:25:23] <Obormot\Arcturus> And that clearly didn't happen, and it's worth asking why
[07:25:49] <Obormot\Arcturus> Just saying "well you don't just want to hire your friends" isn't an answer; "just be a community of weirdo friends" wasn't ever the point
[07:26:52] <Obormot\Arcturus> Like, the intent, and expectation, was that at some point you'd set out to hire the best programmers or biologists or w/e, look around, and what do you know, it's rationalists who are the best everything, so you end up hiring rationalists by dint of hiring the best
[07:28:05] <TheWhisper> At least one problem with "hiring the best" is there is no effective way to determine if any given candidate is the best
[07:28:32] *** Quits: adiabatic (~adiabatic@user/adiabatic) (Ping timeout: 255 seconds)
[07:29:09] <gwern> if rationalists were the best, that wouldn't be a problem
[07:29:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> "“Good judgment” or reducing cognitive biases is social science, and requires people with expertise in psychology, behavioral economics, decision theory, cognitive science, and the like. It might also benefit from collaboration with people who work in finance, who (according to Tetlock’s research) are more effective than average at avoiding cognitive biases, and have a long tradition of valuing strategy and quantitative
[07:29:12] <Obormot\Arcturus>  thinking." ... and then it turned out that half this shit is just un-replicable nonsense, and yet *despite that*, rationalists still didn't end up being the best at any of it
[07:29:13] <TheWhisper> You can only hire from a pool of friends with whom you have prior experience to evaluate. But, that's still just "the best of my Dunbar's-number-or-similar-value"
[07:29:38] <TheWhisper> gwern, if you have two rationalist SWEs, how do you determine which one is the best?
[07:30:11] <adiabatty> whichever squats more
[07:30:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> Who cares? If you accidentally get the second best because you can't tell whether Alice is 1% better than Bob or vice-versa, but they're both 200% better than Carol... so what?
[07:30:13] <TheWhisper> Also, as Obormot\Arcturus pointed out, if there is no exclusivity — anyone can claim to be a rationalist — then there's no vetting to keep the pool limited to only the best
[07:30:22] <TheWhisper> lol adiabatty 
[07:30:43] <gwern> TheWhisper: you hire both because you're winning so hard you need all the rationalists bodies you can hire
[07:30:49] <TheWhisper> Hah
[07:30:54] <adiabatty> interesting we're talking about rationalists and history — I just finished listening to namespace on the eigenrobot podcast
[07:30:56] <TheWhisper> And Obormot\Arcturus, you make a good point too
[07:31:06] <TheWhisper> What we really need is a neural net that can determine if someone is a True Rationalist
[07:31:18] <TheWhisper> just by looking at them and measuring the distance between their pupils
[07:31:28] <adiabatty> TheWhisper: why have a boolean  when you can nave  a real on [0, 1]
[07:31:44] <Obormot\Arcturus> Indeed, the broader point here is that it's just not clear why "accepting and nurturing weirdoes in the Bay Area" should have *anything* to do with the rationalist project as originally envisioned
[07:32:01] <TheWhisper> It sounds more like a Compassionist fork
[07:32:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> Sure, make a community of weird people you nurture... but now, back to talking about rationality
[07:32:16] <TheWhisper> Compassionalist?
[07:33:18] <adiabatty> EY pointed out this trap in his epistle to  the NY lesswrongians — he said you should have a club and if someone doesn't do the work (whatever that  is), you have to form a committee and kick the person out
[07:33:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> If I ask "so, how has the rationalist project been doing" and you go "we've done pretty well at making an accepting community for weird people", it just seems like a non sequitur
[07:34:04] <Obormot\Arcturus> Like "hey man how's that coding project coming along" "I ran five miles today!" ... like, what
[07:34:44] <gwern> in retrospect, it's quite ironic how rationalists won. eliezer founded miri and wrote the sequences to raise awareness of AI risk, why our cognitive biases blind us to it, and the philosophical & AI challenge of safe AI beyond the insanely naive conventional wisdom back then of "it'll never happen and if it does it'll just automatically be nice". then he pivoted to instrumental rationality...
[07:34:50] <gwern> ...spinning off CFAR from MoR basically, and then retreated to work on logical decision theory in peace and quiet. the third one has thus far proven completely useless; the second one 'succceeded' but maybe in a way better that it'd never happen at all; and the first one, ignored and neglected, went on to change the world, helped along by another niche LW topic, random cryptopunk stuff that...
[07:34:56] <gwern> ...people like me or wei dai were interested in because we were oldschool
[07:36:38] <gwern> incidentally, did you know eliezer helped introduce hassabis to thiel?
[07:36:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> I did not know that
[07:36:48] <Obormot\Arcturus> Amazing
[07:36:50] <TheWhisper> What was the effect that went on to change the world?
[07:37:05] <gwern> I didn't either, but it's a random piece of gossip in metz's new DL history book
[07:37:20] <adiabatty> I'm assuming "hassabis" is an uncapitalized surname and not a variety of plant?
[07:37:23] <gwern> TheWhisper: I guess you don't remember the AI world pre-_Superintelligence_/DM/OA
[07:37:33] <TheWhisper> Ah, I do
[07:38:04] <TheWhisper> I just wasn't sure how the "random cryptopunk stuff" fit in
[07:38:13] <gwern> bitcoin and ethereum
[07:38:25] <TheWhisper> Okay, that's what I thought, but wasn't sure
[07:38:36] <TheWhisper> I assumed based on the Wei Dai name drop
[07:38:37] <gwern> crypto has represented... gosh, I don't even know what percentage of MIRI's total lifetime revenue thus far
[07:38:46] <gwern> it's probably well over half now
[07:40:15] <gwern> anyway, eliezer has made 3 big bets in his life thus far. 1 of them worked. considering the nature of these things, that seems like a good track record
[07:40:57] <TheWhisper> I really should read the sequences

[08:07:57] <gwern> tonight's gwern.net linting: revisiting all of the old PDFs to force OCR on them. I have my scripts set to compress PDFs with ocrmypdf, but ocrmypdf, quite sensibly, does not add OCR if it detects a text layer already, and my script also doesn't save the ocrmypdf version if it is not at least 10% smaller than the original. unfortunately, it turns out that a decent number of PDFs have total...
[08:08:03] <gwern> ...garbage text layers, or no text at all: either they didn't compress well, or the OCR is ancient OCR little better than random noise, or the 'text layer' is paywall garbage like "This PDF was downloaded from Cambridge University Press; all rights reserved" (thanks a lot)
[08:08:27] <shawwwn> at least you can turn off the popups now
[08:08:31] <shawwwn> gwern.net has never been better
[08:08:51] <gwern> so what I did was do a heuristic check: dump the page count, dump the text layer & count words, and *force* ocrmypdf to overwrite any text layer if there is no text layer or if it averages <100 'words' per page.
[08:09:13] <shawwwn> actually, am I trippin, or did ya'll change the layout slightly? https://i.imgur.com/R56lMbr.png
[08:09:14] <gwern> amusingly, it has crashed 3 times now because there are PDFs so bizarre exiftool/ocrmypdf just crash on them

[08:09:32] <gwern> (thus far, a roundtrip through pdftk has fixed the boobytrap PDFs...)

[12:07:09] <quanticle> Anyway, this whole notion of tie-in novels got me thinking
[12:07:18] <quanticle> How is it that fanfic sites exist?
[12:07:35] <quanticle> Why haven't they been absolutely obliterated by lawsuits?
[12:08:46] <saturn2> they don't make money
[12:09:26] <quanticle> Why hasn't some exec at Universal gone, "They're writing what? Harry's doing what? With Ron? And Hermione? At the same time? What the fuck, why haven't we sued them?"
[12:09:39] <quanticle> "This is a *family friendly* franchise"
[12:09:45] <quanticle> Or Hasbro with MLP
[12:09:49] <rsaarelm> Also, tie-in novels are probably a sideshow instead of the core moneymaker, so them being outcompeted by fanfiction isn't seen as that much of a profit drain.
[12:10:31] <rsaarelm> It's hard to censor lightweight text-only sites and would be bad optics to bring a huge hammer down on your fans.
[12:10:36] <quanticle> No, I'm talking about like reputational harm. Also, even if they don't make any money, what they're doing is still copyright infringement. They're distributing derivative works without a license
[12:11:00] <quanticle> Ah yes, because "bad optics" is *such* an obstacle for the recording and movie industries
[12:11:12] <quanticle> It's stopped them so many times in the past
[12:11:27] <rsaarelm> It's not a *big* obstacle, but it is a concern.
[12:11:41] <rsaarelm> Also, fighting stuff takes time, effort and money.
[12:11:57] <quanticle> Yeah, but that's even more of a factor for the hosting site
[12:12:03] <rsaarelm> I think it comes down to cost-benefit calculation, they don't think the harm is enough to make it worth the trouble.
[12:12:20] <quanticle> You probably wouldn't even need to file the lawsuit. A bunch of angry letters from lawyers would shut them donw
[12:12:22] <quanticle> *down
[12:12:33] <rsaarelm> But yeah, I don't know why it mostly isn't a thing.
[12:12:59] <rsaarelm> I mean Nintendo does bring the hammer down on non-commercial fangames, which is a pretty similar situation.
[12:13:18] <quanticle> Yep
[12:13:35] <saturn2> iirc anne rice tried to get fanfiction.net shut down, but there was such a furor that she gave up
[12:13:38] <rsaarelm> Japan also has the doujin thing where people make explicit porn fan comics and do make small amounts of money from it.
[12:14:20] <rsaarelm> Yeah, if you're a genre writer instead of a big movie studio, you actually can piss off a whole bunch of fans with that shit.
[12:14:48] <rsaarelm> While for TV and movies the fanfictiony fandom is a drop in the bucket compared to normies who go watch Infinity War.
[12:15:18] <quanticle> Yeah, that's why I'm wondering why, for example, Disney hasn't obliterated all the sites that host Star Wars fanfics. Or have they?
[12:15:59] <quanticle> Because Disney is definitely the sort of corporation that exercises "total creative control".

[12:16:59] <saturn2> it's probably better for their family friendly image to just pretend fanfic doesn't exist than to go scouring the internet and bringing it to public attention
[12:18:49] <rsaarelm> Yeah, that too.

[12:19:10] <quanticle> Oh, according to the article, it might fall under one of the fair use exemptions.
[12:19:39] <quanticle> And yeah, it's one thing to go after fanfic authors and wipe them off the Internet. It's another thing to go after fanfic authors and lose.
[12:20:32] <rsaarelm> Wouldn't be very hard to be very anonymous when writing fanfiction. A lot of people would just treat it as a game.
[12:20:35] <quanticle> "Other fandoms faced similar threats from creators. Fox sent cease & desist letters to people who made X-Files fansites and a fanfic mailing list in 1996. Even the usually fanfic tolerant J.K. Rowling had her lawyers send a cease & desist letter to a website that hosted sexually explicit Harry Potter fanfic in 2003."
[12:20:38] <quanticle> Ah, that's more like it
[12:20:42] <rsaarelm> Trickier for the hosting sites which can be targeted of course.
[12:21:27] <quanticle> So okay, mystery solved. Fanfic sites do get wiped off the map if they piss of the original creators.

[13:26:55] <quanticle> My attitude is, if there isn't a parser, it's not a format.
[13:27:07] <quanticle> It's just freeform text
[13:28:22] <saturn2> yeah, the copyright issue is one of the few modern problems that can't really be blamed on neoliberalism as such
[13:29:12] <quanticle> Other than the fact that the President who signed it into law was quite possibly the exemplar of neoliberalism.
[13:29:12] <rsaarelm> There is a working parser, but it's soul-destroying spaghetti code.
[13:29:34] <rsaarelm> Figured I'd refactor it and got some ideas for version 0.2 while I was at it, and this was at the start of July.

[13:40:13] <dbohdan> Starred
[13:40:15] <rsaarelm> Basically the whole idea with my format is that there's a One Weird Trick that lets you take a specific sort of stuff that's a plaintext file equivalent of a bunch of scrawled up postit notes and make it look like a database.
[13:40:52] <rsaarelm> Because typing text files with minimal adhoc syntax is the only UX you can trust and actual databases and binary formats are suspicious and scary.
[13:42:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> http://michaeljohnsonphilosophy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Benacerraf.pdf an amusing paper
[13:42:28] <Robomot> PDF (12 pages; 284 KB) -  …
[13:42:59] <quanticle> Why is this printed in landscape mode?
[13:43:07] <rsaarelm> And then all the orgmode people go "well obviously you have to have the computer-readable bits be self-describing" and then they introduce a bunch of ugly cruft again and make half their stuff gross dangly bits that you're pretty much expected to have emacs macros generate instead of just going all out on trying to make things nice and quick to type by hand.
[13:43:42] <dbohdan> Yes, text files are the most resilient, I agree.  They are also inconvenient to analyze and manipulate at scale and not ACID.  If you need to slice and dice the data, it's better to have it in a database.
[13:44:02] <rsaarelm> But then my big idea of the format doesn't need to be self describing is also fun for the implementation side because parsing a non-self-describing format needs the parser to keep changing itself as it goes.
[13:44:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> "To speak from Frege's standpoint, there is a world of objects - that is, the designata or references of names, descriptions, and so forth - in which the identity relation had free reign. It made sense for Frege to ask of _any_ two names (or descriptions) whether they named the same object or different ones. Hence the complaint at one point in his argument that, thus far, one could not tell from his definitions whether Julius
[13:44:06] <Obormot\Arcturus>  Caesar was a number."
[13:44:26] <rsaarelm> And have some external schema language that drives it, which is currently being provided by the Rust type system and serde.
[13:45:01] <dbohdan> rsaarelm: And why not s-exprs?
[13:45:21] <rsaarelm> Parens are noise, indent-based format is better.
[13:46:03] <rsaarelm> S-exprs are pretty close though, https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-49/srfi-49.html was the starting point for my thing.

Instead of beginning their mathematical training with arithmetic as ordinary men know it, they first learned logic -- in their case, actually set theory."
[13:46:36] <quanticle> Seems like they used _Principia Mathematica_ as a textbook...
[13:47:10] <dbohdan> Python was my main programming language 2007-2014, and between it and YAML I've learned to dislike indentation-based anything

[13:58:38] <dbohdan> rsaarelm: Yes, it was <https://github.com/breck7/space>, which evolved into TreeNotation

[13:59:59] <rsaarelm> Huh, I don't think I've actually seen that earlier thing.

[14:00:11] <Robomot> NestedText: A Human Friendly Data Format — NestedText 3.1.0 documentation
[14:00:28] <rsaarelm> Yeah, it looks like it's closer to my thing. The tree notation stuff seemed to be trying to be some sort of s-expr like more universal thing.
[14:03:16] <rsaarelm> And yeah, nestedtext looks similar too, though it seems to have a bit more syntax.
[14:04:36] <dbohdan> Yep, it became more complex as TreeNotation

[14:14:13] <rsaarelm> Yeah.
[14:15:06] <rsaarelm> It's weird, Brecky's gone out of his way to make his website look like that. I remember it used to have a different theme.
[14:15:25] <quanticle> "XML is not the SUNSA, because an XML document like <a>b</a> can be equivalently represented as a b using a notation with a smaller set of rules."
[14:15:27] <quanticle> Can it? That seems like a weird thing to be just asserting without any proof whatsoever.
[14:16:02] <quanticle> He just throws that out there, without attempting to justify it at all and takes it as a given.
[14:16:52] <rsaarelm> Yeah, his stuff is like that a lot.
[14:17:47] <rsaarelm> I get the sense that he hasn't tried to really bounce his stuff off anyone else and just runs ahead with it.
[14:17:59] <quanticle> "The higher level base 10 Hindu-Arabic numerals are converted into the lower level base 2 binary numbers. So, before your computer solves 2+3, it must do the equivalent of import binary."
[14:18:01] <quanticle> Also a weird thing to say. Does that mean that our clocks, which operate on a Base-60 system are even "higher level" than our ordinary counting? Does this mean that American customary units, which use base-12, more or less, are "higher level" than metric units, and their paltry base-10?
[14:18:24] <rsaarelm> Definitely!
[14:18:35] * quanticle smugs
[14:18:43] <quanticle> I knew American customary was better
[14:18:46] <quanticle> But now I have *proof*

[14:19:58] <nshepperd2> so that's why assembler is higher level than C

[15:07:31] <quanticle> The good thing about being trans is that there are so many stereotypes to choose from. You can be an autistic healer, an autistic programmer, an autistic speedrunner, an autistic webcomic artist, or just a plain autist.

[15:10:27] <quanticle> Ah, okay.

[15:18:54] <PapuaHardyNet> why do you have to be autistic to be trans
[15:19:10] <PapuaHardyNet> that's a strange stereotype I haven't heard of until now
[15:19:22] <quanticle> There's a statistical correlation
[15:19:27] <PapuaHardyNet> I see
[15:19:46] <quanticle> I don't know the full details, but namespace was telling me about it
[15:20:04] <PapuaHardyNet> autism -> neurodivergent -> lonely -> agp -> trans?
[15:20:04] <quanticle> Maybe being trans causes you to be an autist?
[15:20:31] <quanticle> No, I think it's more like there's some common perceptual issue in autistic brains that causes them to view gender differently or something.
[15:20:39] <PapuaHardyNet> interesting
[15:21:42] <nshepperd2> or both autism and trans are caused by prenatal hormone fuckery
[15:22:08] <quanticle> Also possible
[15:22:24] <quanticle> Or maybe transgender minds turn autistic
[15:23:22] <quanticle> But yeah, who knows what the causal mechanism is. Brains are hard, let's write AIs
[15:24:54] <Obormot\Gaia> It's because of ~~~predictive processing~~~
[15:25:36] <quanticle> Well, that explains the autism, but how does that explain the gender dysphoria?
[15:26:11] <Obormot\Gaia> quanticle: And yes, of course I have stats, why
[15:26:40] <Obormot\Gaia> And uh, I dunno, but the "predictive processing" aficionados will have some explanation for how it explains the gender dysphoria and also everything else ever
[15:27:19] <quanticle> Well, if you have stats, you can calculate before/after on healing efficiency

[15:32:44] <dbohdan> rsaarelm: Ah, all right
[15:32:55] <rsaarelm> One interesting bit I remember is focusing on interactions between two users, post and reply, instead of just individual posts.
[15:33:08] <dbohdan> "Forced anonymity fosters society by countering vanity, making users modular, and placing the focus on the content/comments."  FWIW,I think this is massively wrong.  Forced anonymity probably even hurt /b/ when it was implemented.

[15:56:08] <dbohdan> "Most MtFs are lesbians" is often said in the open, I think.  The knowledge never seems to trickle down to the general population.  Ukraine's famous gray market estrogen tycoon Lena had a figure that slightly less than half trans women are lesbian on her homepage in the mid-2000s.

[18:47:03] * gwern slept poorly due to the earworm of "1985". he remembers one dream where he was going to "Evil Hogwarts", where douring Poisons lesson with Snape he discovered the Orangutan of Death haunts evil wizards and if you get hit with a bludger or something, you need to be ready to bluff the Orangutan (who looks like shawwwn) by telling it loudly how fine you are, look, there's no hole, even, do you see 
[18:47:09] * gwern any blood? don't be daft, you stupid monkey, it's not my time. apparently this is why so many wizards die in their sleep, as they are unable to talk when the orangutan comes for them

When applied to remote sensing, this amount of time depends on the orbital characteristics of the sensor platform as well as sensor characteristics. The temporal resolution is high when the revisiting delay is low and vice-versa. Temporal resolution is usually expressed in days

[20:05:09] <shawwwn> haha. well, I'm trying to cheer you up, so I won't be too hard on you
[20:05:16] <gwern> (and being bullied for watching anime? what is this story from, 1990?)
[20:05:16] <shawwwn> suffice to say, stuff like this happens
[20:05:36] <shawwwn> christian schools are like literally a horror show
[20:06:09] <shawwwn> of course, I have no indication this was a religious school, but good lord, as someone who was sent to a lutheran one, it was like brainwash: the game

[20:22:46] <kuudes> wait, what is [0][0]? is there a default array in python?
[20:23:36] <shawwwn> I was briefly confused too
[20:23:43] <shawwwn> but [0] is of course its own array
[20:23:43] <catern> [0] is an array with one element (0), [0] is array lookup at index 0
[20:24:11] <shawwwn> i have no idea -- literally none -- why that's a valid loop index though
[20:24:23] <catern> it's also a valid thing to assign to
[20:24:29] <catern> e.g. `[0][0] = "discard"`
[20:25:00] <catern> kind of a cute alternative to using _ as a discard/unused variable
[20:25:22] <catern> since unlike _, it actually discards the thing you assign to it (or rather, puts it in a list which is immediately discarded)
[20:26:05] <gwern> 'Asshole Victim: The Yellow(journalism)tail. After spreading nasty rumors and causing no end of chaos in the kingdom, she's fished. A gruesome enough fate, but Ela goes up to eat her, and Yellowtail's last moments are her going Laughing Mad at realizing a real scandal that eclipsed anything she'd imagine was right under her nose the whole time and she'd never get to reveal it.' wow
[20:26:54] <shawwwn> oh, yes
[20:27:12] <shawwwn> of course. if you think of it like [0][0] = "discard", then of course [0][0] is a valid loop variable
[20:27:14] <shawwwn> thanks catern
[20:27:32] <catern> shawwwn: also, that feature of and/&& is very common - "and" works that way in most (every?) Lisp, for example
[20:27:36] *** Joins: Urchin[emacs] (~user@user/urchin)
[20:29:18] <catern> the equivalent feature for "or" is quite useful for having defaults - you can have, e.g., or(user_provided_value, get_dynamically_configured_value(), "last-ditch-default")
[20:29:32] <catern> and it will return the first one that isn't falsey

[20:55:50] <feep> oyeah, regarding the difference of japanese games
[20:56:07] <feep> I think another one-sentence summary for it is "who are you doing the quest *for*?"
[20:56:24] <feep> skyrim, for instance, has absolutely zero answer to this
[20:56:36] <feep> I mean, aside the utterly literal

[20:56:40] <Robomot> Adding None-aware operators to Python? [LWN.net]
[20:57:00] <feep> more like ... me: "who is your character doing the quest for?" skyrim: "your ... character?"
[20:58:09] <feep> hey, you know what western game has a pretty good character based motivation? max payne fucking two.
[20:58:35] <feep> like, it's even got *kinda* a diverse cast of *sorta* likeable characters, by which I mean three
[20:59:12] <feep> who have cleanly painted character motivations tha are revealed in story and gameplay
[20:59:52] <feep> sadly we cannot date vinny
[21:00:11] <feep> and there's only one waifu
[21:00:14] <feep> get on the ball, remedy
[21:01:03] <feep> I mean, shit, I actually remember jim bravura, and I literally played that game ten years ago, and he was in it for like ten minutes.
[21:02:19] <PapuaHardyNet> zen bondage huh
[21:02:21] <feep> I mean, in summary, the big brain take here is, I think western games have better gameplay than japanese games because they are *carried* by gameplay.
[21:02:30] <feep> it's a survival trait.
[21:02:45] <feep> why do we play skyrim? because it's there, and the act of playing is enjoyable.
[21:02:50] <dbohdan> feep: But doesn't this contradict your previous statement that in Western games your character often works for an organization?  That's who the question is for, then: your equivalent of Vault 13.
[21:03:00] <dbohdan> *the quest is for
[21:03:11] <catern> "While these graphs tell us nothing about causation, we ran the numbers and found the degree of association to be “very strong,” which is the highest category statistically possible" gee whiz
[21:03:15] <feep> dbohdan: yes, but also no, because an organization doesn't have screentime.
[21:03:29] <feep> dbohdan: also on reflection, I 100% totally recant that view
[21:04:12] <feep> let me go check the logs so I can remember what I was wrong about.
[21:04:26] <dbohdan> feep: Ah, okay
[21:05:02] <feep> dbohdan: no I kind of stand by what I said, it's just even worse
[21:05:34] <feep> dbohdan: in that I thought western games had you following some organizational structure that motivated you extrinsically as a framework
[21:05:44] <dbohdan> catern: from __future__ import monads
[21:05:45] <feep> and my new take is too often, western games have nothing.
[21:06:11] <PapuaHardyNet> western games have nothing?
[21:06:12] <feep> like, it doesn't *matter* functionally that in skyrim you work for the stormcloaks or the empire, those are just excuses.
[21:06:26] <feep> PapuaHardyNet: skyrim has no character motivation at all.
[21:06:27] <dbohdan> feep: I think this is a better take.  If anything, I *wish* more Western games had you working for some cool organization.
[21:06:36] <feep> you have to roleplay to get the barest bones of justification for anything you do.
[21:06:45] <catern> dbohdan: I wish
[21:06:52] <feep> dbohdan: heck yeah
[21:06:58] <feep> oyeah, control has you working for a cool organization
[21:07:04] <PapuaHardyNet> feep: they've sacrificed depth for breadth, and that will continue to happen in open world games whose focus is on superficial freedom of choice
[21:07:04] <feep> but it's actualized by memorable characters!
[21:07:13] <feep> you *want* to save fridge guy, for the sake of himself.
[21:07:21] <feep> PapuaHardyNet: I kind of disagree.
[21:07:33] <feep> PapuaHardyNet: because like, see fallout 4.
[21:07:45] <feep> they *want* to be character motivated, they want to be character motivated so fucking hard.
[21:08:09] <PapuaHardyNet> I haven't played the fallout series. I have only played morrowind and daggerfall
[21:08:12] <feep> I suspect they just straight up didn't know how.
[21:08:27] <feep> I mean heck, even morrowind has basic character motivation
[21:08:28] <PapuaHardyNet> I assume you don't count Witcher3 and cyberpunk as western games?
[21:08:42] <feep> what? they're 100% western games
[21:08:50] <PapuaHardyNet> oh wait, what motivation does our character have? surely not the main quest
[21:08:53] <dbohdan> catern: Monkey's paw: Python 4 will go all in on monads.  By the time it is adopted even Java will have an effect system.
[21:08:55] <PapuaHardyNet> re morrowind
[21:09:04] <feep> I am given to understand they are better at that, I wouldn't know
[21:09:10] <feep> I quit witcher 3 when the cheese wizard showed up
[21:09:40] <PapuaHardyNet> nah feep, there's just the main quest in morrowind. Although morrowind is far deeper than Skyrim, and your choices matter a lot more since questlines intersect
[21:10:01] <feep> PapuaHardyNet: no like, at least in the very beginning, you want to do the quests cause the imperial people tell you to, whatshisface in balmora
[21:10:18] <feep> right, I'm saying, you haven't seen skyrim yet
[21:10:28] <PapuaHardyNet> but how is that different from killing the first dragon near Whiterun?
[21:10:29] <catern> dbohdan: ah but Java already has an effect system, checked exceptions
[21:10:32] <feep> morrowind has an almost total lack of relation bound motivation for your character
[21:10:45] <feep> PapuaHardyNet: no that part works
[21:10:55] <feep> killing the dragon is bound into a character scene involving the yarl

[21:11:38] <PapuaHardyNet> I still don't clearly get what you mean. perhaps an example quest or scene from skyrim would help; I've played that game for a decade now
[21:11:45] <dbohdan> catern: Fair.  Maybe they can extend it for tracking purity.
[21:12:10] <feep> PapuaHardyNet: okay like. um. as an example, we can take what is there and how it fails to cohere.
[21:12:16] <feep> let's take the civil war plotline.
[21:12:45] <feep> putting aside here for a moment that your character has zero reason to do it, let's say I roleplay that the empire tried to kill me, so it's going the fuck down, that's what I usually do
[21:13:17] <feep> the *entire god damn war* has the shape "ulfric's commander person tells you to go do a quest, you do the quest, you come back. you go assault a location. the war counter ticks up by one."
[21:13:38] <catern> dbohdan: haha that would be a crazy amusing level of reuse... if I cared about Java I might actually do that, it would fit with https://openjdk.java.net/projects/loom/ very well
[21:13:39] <Robomot> OpenJDK: Loom
[21:13:40] <feep> when the war counter completes, you fight a BIG location, and then there's a cutscene where people are grateful.
[21:14:14] <feep> and ... here's the sad part. you go watch a scene as you fight a location and it gets taken over.
[21:14:29] <feep> people sort of react according to their character, grudges are revealed, old wounds are reopened, scores are settled
[21:14:36] <feep> none of it involves you in any way, even the slightest.
[21:14:43] <feep> and none of it ever links back to the stormcloaks.
[21:15:16] <PapuaHardyNet> so, it is all superficial, there are no interconnections, no in-depth interactions between characters and their arcs?
[21:15:19] <feep> in summary, you get character beats when bethesda notices that this is a scene that should ought to have character beats.
[21:15:28] <feep> yes exactly!
[21:15:32] <feep> and *nothing* that connects to *you*.
[21:15:50] <feep> shit, here's an example
[21:15:57] <PapuaHardyNet> I see, nothing connects to your character. Because you are so intensely free, you are also never a part of the world
[21:16:09] <feep> you find evidence in the thalmor embassy that ulfric got tortured by the elves and possibly they still got dirt on him
[21:16:18] <feep> how does this affect your relationship with ulfric?
[21:16:24] <feep> ... what fucking relationship?!
[21:16:31] <feep> there isn't any!
[21:17:05] <PapuaHardyNet> surely an argument could be made that relationships are there, just superficial, in the game, such as stranger - friend - lover - enemy
[21:17:07] <feep> this is why the reward for the mage guild quest, which is a *bit* better about this, is you get made the archmage
[21:17:27] <feep> this is *always* the reward, because bethesda have no fucking idea how to reward you for your service without giving you fiat status
[21:17:35] <feep> that's also why it means nothing.
[21:17:55] <feep> PapuaHardyNet: yes, but that's damning with faint praise.
[21:18:10] <feep> I could say there are exactly two relationships in morrowind: staring placidly at you, and "you n'wah!"
[21:18:20] <PapuaHardyNet> hahahah
[21:18:35] <feep> hey, you know what western game had fucking amazing characters and relationships
[21:18:45] <feep> -okay, psychonauts now that I think about it-
[21:18:53] <feep> I *was* thinking of beyond good and evil, but psychonauts is even better
[21:19:10] <PapuaHardyNet> I think linear games would have "amazing characters and relationships", as you put it
[21:19:15] <PapuaHardyNet> RE7 and RE8?
[21:19:40] <feep> I haven't played them, but I'd believe it
[21:19:51] <feep> yeah, half-life 2 as well, not much but what's there is crisply executed
[21:19:55] <PapuaHardyNet> There's also Wolfenstein I and II which I'm excited to one day play
[21:20:27] <PapuaHardyNet> feep: Dishonored and Dishonored II (haven't played this one), Prey
[21:20:41] <feep> but like, beyond good and evil *literally has you, the player, bond with characters through a gameplay mechanic where you come to share in your character's feelings*
[21:21:02] <PapuaHardyNet> huh
[21:21:04] <feep> PapuaHardyNet: oh, dishonored is fascinating because its relationships are almost all negative, lol. I'd argue dishonored 2 is almost a counterexample.
[21:21:20] <feep> PapuaHardyNet: I speak, of course, of chasing down your dog in the beginning 
[21:21:42] <feep> PapuaHardyNet: those are the cutest, emotionally and relationally positive 30 seconds of gameplay I have literally ever seen in a western game. (pet the dog!)
[21:22:15] <feep> and the game knows what it has there, and it fucking uses it later to elevate one of the saddest moments in the story even higher
[21:22:33] <feep> it's competent and  tight, is what I'm saying
[21:22:55] <feep> it builds links, it develops them, and then it uses them to make story beats resonate

[21:40:12] <catern> dbohdan: that comment thread is quite interesting -oh , and I see now it's from Ron Pressler!
[21:40:15] <feep> you go to a place, you meet people, you have interactions with them that cause you to learn about their character - and they learn about you, you bond - and so initially you are driven by exploration and completionism
[21:40:29] <dbohdan> catern: Yep
[21:40:58] <feep> but then as the plot kicks off, these people are in danger, and *you want to save them*. *raz* wants to save them, because he knows them and they're his friends (and because he wants to show off for lily, tale as old as time), and so there's alignment between character motivation and player motivation.
[21:41:20] <feep> this is why psychonauts is remembered as one of the greatest games of all time, despite the gameplay being horseshit.
[21:41:48] <catern> dbohdan: but yeah, I don't know how "litter your code with async/await" got so popular - it seems like a total fad, because it doesn't seem necessary for many of the languages adopting it...
[21:42:38] <feep> and of course, psychonauts gives itself the affordance to do this, by literally linking the gameplay with resolving people's emotional issues.

[22:07:36] <galambo_> dbohdan, really? looking forward to it :D
[22:08:04] <galambo_> there was one about street fighter kind of games. like the author compared all the games in the genre
[22:08:26] <dbohdan> What I am suggesting is that you can't really pick the best game in its genre.  It varies from person to person, even for competitive multiplayer games.
[22:09:00] <dbohdan> feep: By the way, I wonder what you'd think of _Fallen London_'s manner of storytelling.  It presents itself as being about its characters' relationships and secrets, but it is actually kind of impersonal in a very Western way.  (For instance, character names are "The $adjective $profession".)

[22:09:41] <rsaarelm> I liked Sunless Sea, though maybe more because of the original writing than the game mechanics specifically.
[22:10:10] <rsaarelm> I guess Sunless Sea is similar to Fallen London?
[22:10:18] <catern> sunless sea was good, sunless skies was even better if you're looking for more
[22:10:33] <dbohdan> rsaarelm: I played it for the writing, yes.  _Fallen London_ is almost all writing.  I funded _Sunless Sea_, and I still haven't really played it. :-/
[22:10:55] <galambo_> dbohdan, I mean there are objective measures of the best movies or music
[22:10:59] <galambo_> like imdb top 250
[22:11:03] <galambo_> or rateyourmusic
[22:11:45] <dbohdan> galambo_: If it's "the best" in that sense, you should look at https://www.metacritic.com/browse/games/score/metascore/all/all/filtered

[22:13:31] <galambo_> disco elysium #5 checks out
[22:13:39] <dbohdan> galambo_: Why is it better than the Metacritic list?
[22:15:10] <catern> (I like games which are free as in freedom. there are some good stories in Battle for Wesnoth. I quite liked the "Affably Evil" campaign (added by a mod))
[22:15:19] <galambo_> dbohdan, metacritic relies heavily on professional reviews. professional reviews have 2 problems. the first problem is they are kind of like the oscars. they dont really correlate that well with what people actually want. the second problem is that technology has developed very considerably in the past years. so many old games have not aged well.
[22:15:53] <galambo_> so like I know there are lots of great games out there
[22:16:03] <galambo_> Im looking for the best by today's standards
[22:18:07] <dbohdan> galambo_: Right, I agree with you about Metacritic relying too much on professional reviews by default, but you can see the top only by user score, too
[22:18:30] <galambo_> dbohdan, not many user ratings. too noisy imo.
[22:19:30] <galambo_> games dont age as well as movies so I think there should be a parameter where older ratings dont count as much
[22:21:45] <dbohdan> galambo_: Yeah, you are right: it looks nosier than Glitchwave.  Games #98, #99, #100 have 21, 4, 42 user ratings respectively on Metacritic.  On Glitchwave they have 66, 1376, and 391.
[22:22:27] <galambo_> dbohdan, I found rateyourmusic.com to reliably have the best music ratings/recommendations
[22:22:52] <gwern> you'd do better to explicitly model 'decay', since it's obviously very different across genre (FPS vs puzzle game?), and unlikely to happen equally even within genre (some games will inherently decay slower)
[22:23:15] <galambo_> and it seems to be the same guys behind glitchwave
[22:23:34] <dbohdan> galambo_: I should check it out.  Thanks for suggesting it.
[22:23:54] <galambo_> true
[22:24:00] <galambo_> re gwern 
[22:25:25] <dbohdan> gwern: Definitely.  And decay varies by platform, too.  Early 2D and early 3D consoles are out of luck.  Few people want to play 3DO games.

[23:12:20] <[itchyjunk]> Who knew!
[23:12:39] <gwern> CAD is hard stuff. look how advanced the first CAD system was
[23:12:54] <gwern> also, very valuable, so you could afford to demand very high end systems
[23:13:21] <[itchyjunk]> Right CAD is hard stuff. i expected it to be written in C or some such for somereason
[23:13:59] <gwern> work smarter, not harder
[23:15:26] <[itchyjunk]> Is lisp an obvious choice for it? I know very little about lisp. i just managed to get hello world to run and i'm doing a bit of light reading on this stuff
[23:15:50] <[itchyjunk]> I thought lisp was FP related but looks like it predated functional programming by decades

[23:22:11] <[itchyjunk]> I.. can't figure it out
[23:22:20] <[itchyjunk]> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AutoLISP
[23:22:20] <Robomot> AutoLISP - Wikipedia (AutoLISP is a dialect of the programming language Lisp built specifically for use with the full version of AutoCAD and its derivatives, which include AutoCAD Map 3D, AutoCAD Architecture and AutoCAD Mechanical.[1] Neither the application programming interface (API) nor the interpreter to execute AutoLISP code are included in the AutoCAD LT product line.[2] …)
[23:23:24] <galambo_> this is a good article on how overpriced tech stocks are today. I dont know how to reconcile this with my bullish views on AI. tech stocks can have a correction and yet tech companies can still have a huge impact in the next few decades: https://rhsfinancial.com/2021/01/11/quantquake-2020-and-the-revenge-against-the-nerds/

[23:24:14] <[itchyjunk]> I guess it's written in C++? either i can't google or don't understand what google is telling me.

[23:26:15] <gwern> as autocad predates c++, that must be a rewrite
[23:28:45] <[itchyjunk]> ahh
[23:30:28] * gwern doesn't find anything about the original microcad. given the era and many extension languages, that suggests that it may well have been assembler

[23:32:11] <[itchyjunk]> man, those people who wrote stuff in assembly must have been a different breed of programmer
[23:33:19] <two2thehead> I wonder how much compsci lore has been lost due to programmers generally not being good at or enjoying writing?
