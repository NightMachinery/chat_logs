[16:19:07] <wasamasa> why not?
[16:19:09] <wasamasa> gpg does that
[16:22:10] <BadKarma> duck[m]: Okay let's think about this for a second. The ultimate purpose of keeping the private key is to maintain and verify the integrity of the secret. This can be done by keeping the private key secure, by adding layers of encryption (ephemeral diffie hellman key), etc…
[16:22:41] <BadKarma> denying access to the key by means of encryption should do the trick
[16:22:51] <BadKarma> could you elaborate?
[16:23:04] <BadKarma> wasamasa: does it?
[16:23:24] <wasamasa> what do you think the password prompt is for when you try to do something using the private key?
[16:23:39] <wasamasa> or why would it ask for a passphrase to protect the private key with?
[16:24:12] <duck[m]> <wasamasa> "why not?" <- There’s not a threat model where it makes sense; an attacker with arbitrary read access to your disk can steal browser cookies and much more.
[16:24:49] <wasamasa> ok, let's actually think about that for a second
[16:25:01] <wasamasa> there's an unencrypted private key on disk, attacker reads disk, game over
[16:25:12] <wasamasa> there's an encrypted private key on disk, attacker reads disk, game not over
[16:25:51] <wasamasa> therefore, there is a point encrypting it, unless you put the key for that on the disk, lol
[16:27:40] <wasamasa> hence why gpg prompts for a passphrase and why a yubikey prompts you for a pin
[16:27:42] <duck[m]> You’re ignoring the real-word implications beyond narrowly focusing on the private key

[17:08:41] <ms7821> you could store the private key in your password manager

[21:50:54] <ioxzev1z> How can someone differentiate between a pseudo-random and truly random number? If I roll a fair die and get the number 4, you would say that it's truly random, but if I read from /dev/urandom and get the number 3 it is pseudo random, but if I give you the numbers 4 and 3, how can one be more random than the other?
[21:51:14] <ioxzev1z> There is no information in 3 to suggest pseudo-random
[21:51:16] <ms7821> if it's a good PRNG, you can't
[21:51:39] <ms7821> which is why randomness tests are a minimal requirement for PRNGs, but not sufficient to have confidence
[21:52:33] <ioxzev1z> The OTP for example wants "truly random" numbers, and technically padding with data from /dev/urandom is therefore not random enough
[21:52:51] <ms7821> /dev/urandom is a CSPRNG, it's totally enough
[21:53:45] <ioxzev1z> It might be enough, but it's still not "truly random" like a dice roll
[21:53:56] <edk> it's not enough for information-theoretic security
[21:54:43] <ms7821> well, it's not enough for a simplistic proof of security, but that's why most discussions around OTP are fruitless
[21:55:34] <ms7821> /dev/urandom is likely to have better randomness characteristics than you randomly rolling a dice a large number of times
[21:55:42] <edk> that's irrelevant
[21:56:03] <ms7821> the topic is "How can someone differentiate between a pseudo-random and truly random number", it's really not
[21:57:17] <ms7821> the fair dice discussed as an example of perfect randomness is not likely to exist in the real world
[21:57:31] <edk> sure it is, because one possible answer is "by knowing the PRNG state"
[21:57:40] <edk> it is not, but lots of other true random number generators do exist
[22:01:24] <ms7821> they're a shorthand for something that generates an unpredictable secret anyway. any other mechanism for doing so will work
[22:03:42] <edk> unpredictable is not necessarily enough
[22:04:15] <edk> a CSPRNG will never have the properties that OTP with a true RNG has because the outputs of a CSPRNG are not equally likely
[22:04:46] <ms7821> > that's why most discussions around OTP are fruitless
[22:08:32] <edk> if you want them to be they will be
[22:09:28] <edk> you might consider how they differ in the case that someone claims to find the CSPRNG seed (for CSPRNG "OTP") vs the random pad
[22:10:01] <Bostik> IMO if you need information-theoretical security for your RNG, you are either dealing with nation-state secrets or online gambling (and the latter only because of the extremely litigious nature of the clientele)
[22:10:32] <edk> well, the most reasonable reason to attempt it is future-proofing
[22:11:19] <edk> it's hard to predict either what nation-states may be interested in in 50 years, or which CSPRNGs will have been broken
[22:11:33] <Bostik> sure, there are special radioactive decay emitters and quantum-optics, but if you need those as your baseline, your threat model is pretty extreme

[23:58:31] <jtgd> I thought for crypto the issue was predictability. PRNG is predictable no matter how random the output looks.
[23:59:05] <edk> it depends on your point of view but yes
[23:59:55] <yawkat> i would actually say that while the entropy for PRNGs is lower, they are unpredictable as well. there is no efficient way to predict them.
