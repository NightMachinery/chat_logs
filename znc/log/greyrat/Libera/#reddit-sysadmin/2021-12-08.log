[02:43:28] <yuken> but measurements nonetheless.
[02:43:50] <SantaGibby> pick up some measuring cups from walmart for like $5 my dude
[02:44:07] <SantaGibby> if you're going to be doing this with any consistency 
[02:44:26] <yuken> 3/4 cup of granulated sugar, small spoonful of yeast + yeast nutrient (cider yeast from a local brewing company), gallon of apple juice.
[02:44:29] <yuken> and that's it.
[02:45:26] <SantaGibby> anywho, when it stops blubbing, bottle it using priming sugar and let sit for 30 days
[02:46:00] <yuken> How much priming sugar you reckon is good?
[02:46:05] <yuken> obviously that'll depend on my yeast and ambient temps
[02:46:06] <yuken> but still.
[02:46:47] <SantaGibby> well, if you had a scale, I'd say 1oz for every gallon 
[02:47:09] <SantaGibby> but I'm sure you can find a conversion online
[02:47:10] <yuken> oh, well I can just convert weight to volume, if you're saying 1oz of granulated sugar.
[02:47:17] <SantaGibby> no
[02:47:25] <SantaGibby> I'm saying 1oz of *priming* sugar
[02:47:29] <SantaGibby> which is dextrose 
[02:47:35] <yuken> Oh.
[02:47:41] <yuken> I do not have such a thing, SantaGibby.
[02:48:03] <yuken> I have sucrose/table sugar, no dextrose.
[02:49:22] <SantaGibby> I would consult the googles, then
[02:49:33] <yuken> will do then, thanks gibby lvoe you.
[02:49:52] <SantaGibby> iirc its not a 1:1 thing, so don't dump a fucking oz of sugar in expecting it to be the same :) 
[02:50:19] <SantaGibby> ya need a food scale, measuring cups, and some dextrose for your next one heh
[02:50:22] <yuken> I'd imagine this is a finer sugar than table sugar too.
[02:50:35] <SantaGibby> its corn sugar, so its a bit different 
[02:50:45] <SantaGibby> but yes, typically it is finer

[05:34:48] <csws> oh
[05:34:59] <csws> so there's some stupid form you gotta fill out and send off if you get suppressors and shit apparently
[05:35:06] <yuken> in the US? yes.
[05:35:13] <csws> and they're now making it an eform so it should take a lot less time to file
[05:35:17] <yuken> ATF Form 4 for transfers of NFA items, Form 1 for creation of NFA items
[05:35:18] <yuken> >now
[05:35:23] <csws> yeah form 4
[05:35:23] <yuken> that's been a thing for a long time lol csws.
[05:35:26] <csws> no
[05:35:28] <csws> it's different
[05:35:28] <yuken> e-form takes like 20-40 days.

[05:35:38] <csws> anyway it was a forgotten weapons video talking about it
[05:35:40] <yuken> I can't do Form 4 NFA items yet until I turn 21.
[05:35:44] <jay-ros> enix
[05:35:47] <csws> it's a new system where you can do fingerprints and shit online
[05:35:54] <yuken> ohhhh, electronic fingerprints
[05:35:58] <yuken> yeah, you'd have to send in fingerprints manually before.
[05:36:06] <csws> yeah the whole thing is end to end eform
[05:36:07] <e1> jay-ros: 
[05:36:12] <csws> don't have to send anything off now
[05:36:25] <csws> oh well looks like tehy got it done just in time for you lol
[05:36:27] <yuken> csws, I can do Form 1 NFA items until I turn 21, or private transfer Form 4 items in-state
[05:36:32] <yuken> but glhf finding private silencer sellers.
[05:36:54] <yuken> since you _CAN_ privately transfer NFA items just fine, and it follows all other private transfer laws.
[05:37:46] <csws> anyway thought it might pique your interest
[05:38:04] <yuken> yee, that's nice.
[05:38:54] <yuken> I am considering just moving to a state that ignores the NFA though, csws - although there are some caveats there. Basically, no part that could be legally controlled - meanign any "firearm part" - can be sourced out of state. But, if you make the entire firearm from parts which are unregulated, then _in theory_ it holds up in court.
[05:39:15] <yuken> So if you buy blank aluminium and steel blocks and make a silencer or machine gun in, say, Arizona - that seems to be perfectly legal csws.
[05:39:37] <yuken> But you couldn't, say, buy a trigger from a manufacturer and put it into the gun, that'd be illegal. Or any other regulated part.
[05:41:49] <csws> man I wish I could go to the states but biden banned me
[05:42:08] <yuken> lol
[05:42:22] <yuken> Just do it anyway, csws, ez.
[05:42:26] <csws> tbh
[05:42:34] <csws> going up through mexico is tempting lol
[05:42:43] <yuken> csws, are you aware of how NFA items are regulated, and how it plays into a FUCK-LOAD of federal power grabs in the US?
[05:43:41] <csws> no since it doesn't really affect me but i'll read up on it if I can ever get into the US on a legit visa lol
[05:43:50] <csws> I might have to wait until at least summer or mid terms though it seems
[05:44:15] <yuken> csws, ok well basically - base US documents have a short list of powers granted to federeal government. Very short. One of which is the ability to "regulate interstate commerce".
[05:44:17] <csws> or hopefully a legal challenge takes care of some of the bullshit
[05:44:23] <yuken> Now obviously that's to prevent Texas from charging 690% tarrif to California, right?
[05:44:47] <yuken> except they interpret it as "we can ban anything we want by banning its use in interstate commerce". And that's how _A LOT_ of things are regulated federally - marijuana and guns, for example.

[05:56:57] <csws> upper house voting was different last time around
[05:57:02] <csws> they got rid of STP
[05:57:28] <csws> so you don't have to number like 100 boxes below the line lol

[06:32:53] <csws> recently I should say
[06:33:18] <csws> the idea is that the liberals are deliberately fucking up and throwing the election because they know the economy is going to burst into flames next year and they want labor to end up taking the blame

[23:10:29] <SantasWiFi> what kind of sec changes are present in core installs vs standard
[23:11:40] <Hunterkll> secured core is different than server core..... in a  manner of speaking....
[23:12:19] <Hunterkll> basically just a harsher lockdown default and more utilization of TPM/TXT type technology
[23:12:28] <Hunterkll> you can configure your current installs into such a shape yourself
[23:12:52] <Hunterkll> throw on some HVCI and VBS
[23:12:56] <Hunterkll> and bobs your uncle
[23:12:56] <SantaWasTaken> SantasWiFi: the biggest difference is this https://i.imgur.com/gbzJDfq.png
[23:13:26] <Hunterkll> long story short, it's configuration of already available things, just prepackaged from the outset
[23:13:50] <Hunterkll> secured core "certified"/"approved" hardware is guaranteed to have things like TPM 2.0, MBEC support, etc etc 
[23:14:27] <technonerd> we’ve made the difficult decision to retire Alexa.com on May 1, 2022.
[23:15:09] <Hunterkll> Server 2022 has been able to be configured into secured-core compliant setup since day zero of release

[23:23:15] <Hunterkll> and then uh
[23:23:21] <Hunterkll> those 'deep web' search engines
[23:23:21] <Hunterkll> lol
[23:23:45] <mistiry> i used yahoo and then google. the others were never really more than a novelty for me
[23:24:18] <Hunterkll> Lycos
[23:24:18] <mistiry> i tried bing after a former coworker begged me to, cuz THEY PAY YOU!!! but i just found myself getting more frustrated than anything
[23:24:33] <mistiry> a $20 amazon card a year isnt worth constant frustration over searching
[23:24:35] <SantaWasTaken> bing is only good for very specific porn searches
[23:24:37] <mistiry> excite.com
[23:24:37] <Hunterkll> Fucking Lycos is bing "powered" now apparently
[23:24:43] <Hunterkll> a year? I get like one a month at least lol
[23:25:01] <Hunterkll> i just have bing default, and switch to google if the first page doesn't have the answer
[23:25:03] <mistiry> i had a 1-800 free voicemail number from Excite.com at one point
[23:25:11] <mistiry> Hunterkll: so, every search then?
[23:25:17] <mistiry> that was my experience most of the time
[23:25:24] <Hunterkll> nah
[23:25:28] <Hunterkll> usually don't have to switch to google
[23:25:36] <mistiry> google - answer is RIGHT THERE. bing - search thru tons of results and eventually you can find it
[23:25:38] <Hunterkll> but i'm particular in how i craft my search queries anyway so 
[23:26:00] <Hunterkll> i've found myself switching to bing FROM google when it comes to finding vendor documentation 
[23:26:16] <Hunterkll> and from bing TO google when it comes to finding random ass stackoverflow posts with the other answer

[23:28:11] <Hunterkll> or when google didn't fucking suck?
