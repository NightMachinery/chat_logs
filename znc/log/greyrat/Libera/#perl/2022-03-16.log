[01:35:50] <Awaru> hi
[01:36:02] <Awaru> first to say i have no idea, i just downloaded a perl program and want to run it now
[01:36:13] <Awaru> i also googled, installed several packages etc (debian 11)
[01:36:22] <Awaru> but i get this error when trying to start the perl progrma:

[01:36:31] <Awaru> any idea how to solve this?
[01:36:53] <Awaru> i searched for anyevent packages but they say they already all installed
[01:37:20] <LeoNerd> That's wanting AnyEvent::HTTP, which might not be part of AnyEvent itself.. a separate thing
[01:37:29] <LeoNerd> apt-get install libanyevent-http-perl  or local equivalent

[01:42:12] * GumbyPAN CPAN Upload: Quiq-1.200 by FSEITZ https://metacpan.org/release/FSEITZ/Quiq-1.200
[01:42:26] <Awaru> + this at the end:
[01:42:27] <Awaru> ** need CMC_API_KEY env var **
[01:42:31] <Awaru> does this anything to mean
[01:42:43] <Awaru> btw in the installation notes in the comments what i just found before stands following:
[01:42:53] <Awaru> You need to install some packages via CPAN:
[01:42:53] <Awaru> $ cpanm --sudo common::sense AnyEvent::HTTP AnyEvent::IRC::Client JSON::XS
[01:43:07] <Awaru> do i need to install that JSON::XS too or 
[01:43:32] <LeoNerd> You may well do
[01:43:48] <LeoNerd> That's written by the same author as most of the AnyEvent ecosystem so is probably the preferred JSON encoder around those modules
[01:43:58] <Awaru> but which package is it
[01:44:12] <Awaru> i searched for the libanyevent packages but nothing with json there
[01:44:16] <LeoNerd> JSON::XS
[01:44:22] <LeoNerd> So, libjson-xs-perl
[01:44:25] <Awaru> i just installed all libanyevent packages now
[01:44:47] <Awaru> libjson-xs-perl is already the newest version (4.030-1+b1).
[01:45:10] <Awaru> still getting ** need CMC_API_KEY env var **
[01:45:27] <Awaru> btw is it a problem that the program just has a normal name and not file.ph ?
[01:45:35] <LeoNerd> That sounds like it's complaining that you need to set an environemnt variable before you run the program
[01:45:36] <Awaru> or file.pl whatever the pearl extension is
[01:45:45] <Awaru> well i did everything right
[01:45:46] <LeoNerd> export CMC_API_KEY="whatever the value needs to be"  in the shell
[01:46:06] <Awaru> i even used the example
[01:46:13] <Awaru> same
[01:46:15] <Awaru> + the ** need CMC_API_KEY env var **
[01:46:17] <Awaru> at the end
[01:47:01] <LeoNerd> Mmm well, I've no idea. That's verymuch a specific error from your specific program, so I don't imagine many folks here will have much general insight at this point
[01:47:33] <Awaru> but what does this mean?: ** need CMC_API_KEY env var **
[01:47:41] <LeoNerd> *shrug*
[01:47:54] <alh> It means you need to 'export CMC_API_KEY="..."' as LeoNerd said, most likely
[01:47:57] <LeoNerd> It's not a generic error message. It's something specific from your program
[01:48:03] <Awaru> man quite disappointed now as i never get it to make a github program work
[01:48:06] <LeoNerd> What specifially that means, we can't guess without seeing it :)
[01:48:18] <Awaru> <alh> It means you need to 'export CMC_API_KEY="..."' as LeoNerd said, most likely
[01:48:20] <Awaru> but from where?

[01:50:15] <Awaru> which is what?
[01:50:19] <Awaru> where do i get that from?
[01:50:40] <alh> Apparently this program you're trying to run wants to talk to an API, and it wants a token to authenticate against that API with
[01:50:45] <alh> It should be in the documentation you're using
[01:50:52] <Awaru> nah, stands nothing there
[01:50:56] <alh> My guess is, it's an api token for CoinMarketCap
[01:51:00] <Awaru> i can show u the github site
[01:51:03] <Awaru> yea
[01:51:04] <Awaru> it is
[01:51:10] <Awaru> cause its running over coinmarketcap
[01:51:26] <alh> So you need to go to coinmarketcap's documentation to figure out how to generate one of those tokens for you

[04:46:57] <gordonfish> If you mean stats like how many addresses are still available, all the ones I've seen are fake or based on guess work at best. They always make it seem more dire than it really is, and ignore some key things like DHCP and how in many parts of the world you have things like CGNAT where you have a few hundred or so people sharing one IP.
[04:48:54] <krismatrix> I want to discuss an implementation detail of auth. I am implementing totp and I created bas32 secret, qr code and I have enabled (in a db) a flag that says user should authenticate with totp.
[04:49:32] <krismatrix> Now I want to set up the login system to look up the database and if auth enabled, then instead of going to dashboard, it should go to auth page so that the user can authenticate.
[04:50:30] <krismatrix> I was thinking the way to implement this is do to this in under('/secure') umbrella which is called while a user is logged in ...and check whether the auth flag has been set. If set on sign in, then redirect to authentication template other wise just go to dashboard.
[04:51:03] <krismatrix> And once authenticated, it should set some auth verified stash value, so that it doesn't keep going to auth verified.

[07:33:38] <buu> I bet it needs to be a Myapp::Plugin::TOTP
[07:33:51] <buu> $app->plugin('MyApp::Plugin::SomeThing');
[07:34:59] <buu> krismatrix: If you want it to be Mojo..Plugin..TOTP then it needs to be in a directory structure that looks like Mojo../Plugin/TOTP.pm
[07:35:11] <buu> See stuff here https://metacpan.org/pod/Mojolicious::Plugins#PLUGINS
[07:35:12] <Paperbot> Link title(s): [ Mojolicious::Plugins - Plugin manager - metacpan.org ]
[07:35:26] <krismatrix> I don't follow
[07:35:36] <krismatrix> Is a Mojo plugin different from MyApp plugin?
[07:35:45] <buu> krismatrix: uh
[07:35:55] <buu> krismatrix: Semantically yes, technically no
[07:36:01] <buu> It's just a question of how you refer to it
[07:36:12] <krismatrix> ok...I see.
[07:36:22] <buu> Right now you're using the name Mojolicious::Plugin::TOTP but storing it as MyApp::Plugin::TOTP
[07:36:22] <krismatrix> I guess the plugin I am creating a specifically for my app...so MyApp.
[07:36:28] <krismatrix> Correct.
[07:36:28] <buu> You need both the name and the storage location to agree
[07:36:51] <buu> It doesn't really matter which you choose, other than mojo will default to looking for Mojo::Plugin::*
[07:37:11] <buu> So change the name/package and use the full name for ->plugin
[07:37:17] <buu> make sense?
[07:38:00] <krismatrix> Right...but that means TOTP.pm cannot be in my_app/lib/MyApp/Plugin/ but instead needs to the in whereever Mojolicious keeps its plugins?
[07:39:40] <krismatrix> now i get an error about unable to locate object method helper in TOTP.pm

[07:40:19] <buu> krismatrix: If you put it in MyApp..., then name it MyApp::...
[07:40:27] <krismatrix> yes.
[07:40:34] <buu> That's all
[07:40:53] <rewt> is my_app/lib in your @INC?
[07:41:19] <krismatrix> no
[07:41:43] <buu> really?
[07:41:47] <buu> I bet mojo adds it
[07:42:07] <laidback_01> use FindBin qw($Bin);
[07:42:07] <laidback_01> use lib "$FindBin::Bin/../lib";
[07:42:57] <laidback_01> use FindBin to help you get your lib folders found by your code.  anyway, it's probably not the right way, but it works like a charm!
[07:43:23] <krismatrix> buu: If it does add it, I have not looked into it. certainly..since my app is run via carton...carton probably adds it. My application does not run without carton.
[07:43:36] <laidback_01> I do that quite often when I've got a top level folder with /bin and /lib in it, and I'm calling something from /bin
[07:47:28] <krismatrix> Thanks buu. I have other issues now..but I don't think they are related to plugin code. But I'll tackle that tomorrow i think.

[14:59:51] <vague> jose1711, can you rephrase? Not sure what you mean by foo block
[15:00:32] <vague> But I'm pretty sure it can be solved
[15:01:09] <vague> You want to substitute 'something else'?
[15:01:32] <jose1711> https://l.perl.bot/raw/ekip5z
[15:01:48] <jose1711> and i'd like to replace "b" with "c" but only within those blocks
[15:02:32] <jose1711> trying with substitute and /sge but .. not sure if this can really work or multiple steps are required
[15:02:49] <tirnanog> it might be clearer if you have $var1 show a representative example and add a $var2 showing what it should become.
[15:03:07] <vague> Maybe Parser::MGC would work
[15:03:15] <LeoNerd> Find the positions of the blocks, then use substr($orig, POS) =~ s///;

[15:12:57] <tirnanog> oh, it's markdown. that would need a little tweaking then.
[15:13:10] <The_Blode_> Good morning all. The Perl debugger is giving me an error "Odd number of elements"
[15:13:37] <The_Blode_> I can see a hash array %token is being passed into a subroutine as %token = @_;
[15:13:45] <LeoNerd> You're trying to create a hash. A hash needs an even-sized list of key/value pairs. You're giving it an odd-sized list, meaning it has a single spare value left over
[15:13:48] <The_Blode_> And the error is thrown at the subroutine level.
[15:13:57] <The_Blode_> Oh
[15:14:44] <The_Blode_> How can I dump a hash just to review the contents?
[15:14:46] <The_Blode_> Data Dumper?
[15:14:58] <The_Blode_> Or can I just cycle through the keys as usual
[15:15:58] <LeoNerd> Sure; either works
[15:16:38] <The_Blode_> Thanks Leo
[15:20:16] <The_Blode_> I'm just reviewing the hash, it looks like each key has a value.
[15:20:55] <LeoNerd> Probably you're passing a hashref then
[15:21:11] <LeoNerd> eval: my $ref = { keys => "here" };   my %hash = ($ref);

[15:35:58] <jose1711> not sure if it can bring problems but for some simple tasks it may work
[15:37:00] <Altreus> You /could/ use the flip-flop operator and do it linewise, but that's probably only really necessary if your fun version runs into trouble
[15:37:47] <LeoNerd> It's not always a good idea to solve complex parsing problems with one single regexp ;)
