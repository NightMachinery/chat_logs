[02:16:39] <maverick81> Each of those classes contain these methods: check(), get(), set(), and, do()

[02:46:06] <PlanckWalk> It's PHP so this is a weaker consideration since there is no compiler to tell you that the former is correct or incorrect, but tooling often will

[02:49:26] <maverick81> But the biggest one i'd say is: sometimes the getter or checker are just one liners  — putting one liners in a separate method just doesn't look right to me

[02:50:12] <pyzozord> while lua has 1 based indexing
[02:50:24] <PlanckWalk> 1-line methods are fairly common.
[02:50:54] <pyzozord> no I man array[1] is the first element
[02:51:06] <maverick81> I see, I was told it was wrong to do so. Thanks.
[02:51:12] <pyzozord> and there are few other quirks I don't remember that make lua a bit of an oddball

[02:55:33] <maverick81> For now, they don't. Just a translation layer as I said.
[02:56:06] <maverick81> For now I have observed, there are only a few things in all of progamming: get(), set(), process(), do(), check().
[02:56:36] <maverick81> do() might be a subset of set().
[02:57:20] <sonny> according to oop, yeah probably
[02:57:30] <d3x0r> check is get

[02:57:45] <EdFletcher> https://twitter.com/nice_byte/status/1466940940229046273
[02:58:32] <maverick81> process is for actual logic/transformations. do() for things like Cache::forget
[02:58:38] <sonny> EdFletcher yep
[02:58:40] <maverick81> d3x0r: right
[02:59:03] <flakland> so do() doesn't manipulate this object at all?
[02:59:19] <PlanckWalk> Just because they might be useful categories of methods doesn't mean that yuor API should only have 5 methods.
[02:59:27] <PlanckWalk> (Or fewer)
[03:00:31] <maverick81> EdFletcher lmao, I know I sound ignorant, ready to accept that, that's why I am here: to learn more. Being a troll doesn't help.
[03:00:39] <EdFletcher> nor does it mean that _all_ programming can be so easily abstracted into these 5 buckets 😉
[03:00:52] <EdFletcher> maverick81: i am not trolling, rude to suggest otherwise
[03:01:14] <EdFletcher> and i actually posted that to help _support_ your point, but whatever
[03:01:20] <d3x0r> EdFletcher :) LOL ya that fine line between genius and madness
[03:01:23] <maverick81> That was my opinion as a new dev, of course I am still learning.
[03:01:34] <EdFletcher> how about this instead: "Data dominates. If you've chosen the right data structures and organized things well, the algorithms will almost always be self-evident. Data structures, not algorithms, are central to programming." (Rob Pike)
[03:01:47] <flakland> imo OOP is only 3 operations at its core,  init() action() destroy

[03:09:07] <EdFletcher> sonny: i disagree that more loc === more complexity
[03:09:08] <sonny> so you would have devs rate it?
[03:09:19] <PlanckWalk> Rate it?  This is not a practical measure at all.
[03:09:25] <sonny> might not have enough devs tho
[03:09:33] <EdFletcher> the system may just be broad but simplistic, where nearly all the LOC is boilerplate.

[03:10:58] <EdFletcher> but that's _so_ subjective
[03:11:06] <EdFletcher> pick 5 devs, you'll get 5 unique answers

[08:51:29] <maxzor_> are there fundamental things that you cannot do with a GPU when using either 1. a GPGPU platform like openCL or CUDA/ROCm and 2. a traditional rendering platform like openGL and Vulkan?

[08:54:29] <ent58> fundamentally, there isn't a difference
[08:55:13] <ent58> if your "graphics" data is simply the things you want to compute, it's just using it in a gpgpu fashion
[08:55:28] <flakland> it's not nice though, lots of hacks and square blocks through triangle holes
[08:55:43] <JanC> old OpenGL probably wouldn't be capable of "GPGPU" though...
[08:55:47] <ent58> cuda/opencl just give you friendly interfaces to doing this without rendering in mind
[08:56:13] <ent58> yeah any old fixed function stuff won't cut it now
[08:56:27] <ent58> Vulkan basically destroys the line between the two
[08:57:01] <ent58> it's just the "huge vector coprocessor" now
[08:58:52] <maxzor_> I am trying to understand why Blender, the 3D software, went with CUDA/ROCm for their *renderer* implementation : I would have thought that the cost of using a niche DSL shader language in the traditional rendering pipeline would be offset by better performance against C++ APIs.
[08:59:00] <JanC> mostly because that's more or less what modern GPUs are
[08:59:03] <maxzor_> (Blender Cycles)
[08:59:08] <ent58> flakland: just out of curiosity, what kind of problems would you hit doing that? is it just because there are data structure formats that make assumptions you don't want or something else?
[08:59:50] <JanC> ancient GL/OpenGL cards/drivers probably weren't as "general purpose"-friendly...  :)

[15:10:14] <mrig> CoderGuy I'm coding along with someone who uses a completely different style to the one that I'd adopted of late, the change has been superb for learning to use more of my editor and to adapt.
[15:10:30] <deniska> CoderGuy: while pretty much the only thing asm has is goto, it's just an implementation detail as far a higher level languages are concerned
[15:10:34] <CoderGuy> mrig, that's fine but having a rule like "don't use else" is really dumb
[15:10:51] <deniska> In some languages `if` requires an `else`

[15:11:32] <mrig> CoderGuy yes I could not agree more, always good to keep the mind open to different techniques and practices.

[15:11:55] <CoderGuy> yeah it was weird to see all the comments on the video like "this is great I never use else" like huh? what I don't understand
[15:12:03] <deniska> compilers can output asm, but that's optional, mostly meant for debugging/learning purposes

[15:18:14] <deniska> CoderGuy: there're a few approaches. Generally what CPUs do is reading and writing to and from memory. Then you can wire the rest of a machine that reading or writing to and from some special addresses will interact with hardware instead

[15:33:24] <vdamewood> CoderGuy: CPUs generally work with 'words', which are usually the same size as the CPU's described as. 64bits in a 64bit CPU for example.
[15:33:53] <jkk> http://www.6502.org/users/dieter/
[15:33:57] <CoderGuy> okay but so is that there are 64 on/off bits and then these constantly change as it reads from memory?
[15:34:14] <jkk> author says When trying to build CPUs... watch your back. - correct, gov can try to kill you Xd
[15:34:16] <vdamewood> CoderGuy: But CPUs also have cache where they copy chunks of memory into a quick local storage location for fast access. These are usually a few kilos or a few megabytes.
[15:34:36] <CoderGuy> ohhh so it reads from like l2 cache or whatever
[15:34:40] <vdamewood> CoderGuy: No, these 64 bits are stored in what is called a register.
[15:34:50] <CoderGuy> yeah what's the capacity of the register
[15:35:00] <CoderGuy> like just in general
[15:35:02] <vdamewood> Depends on the CPU.

[15:35:31] <CoderGuy> okay so these 64 bits in the register, are they constnatly being refilled?
[15:35:40] <vdamewood> Though, there are special purpose registers that can hold as much as 512 bits.

[15:36:08] <vdamewood> them*
[15:36:16] <CoderGuy> like lets say you're watching a video
[15:36:33] <CoderGuy> is that register just constantly changing it's on/off position?
[15:36:52] <CoderGuy> say we zoom in on that register, and use lights to simulate it
[15:37:01] <vdamewood> Well, registers aren't on or off, they're considered to be holding a value from 0 to 2 to 64th power.
[15:37:12] <CoderGuy> right does said value constantly change?
[15:37:29] <vdamewood> Constantly? No.
[15:37:44] <CoderGuy> but if it's processing stuff, surely the on/off of everything is always changing no?
[15:38:09] <PlanckWalk> When the CPU executes an instruction that changes them ,they change yes

[15:38:56] <PlanckWalk> Some instructions change a lot more than 64 bits
[15:39:07] <vdamewood> Sometimes a register changes every time a function is called. Sometimes a register changes only whenever something else specific happens. Some registers are treated as scratch paper for calculations and change nearly constantly.
[15:39:11] <CoderGuy> okay ballpark how many bits are being changed & what is the general capacity?
[15:39:28] <CoderGuy> I just want like a picture of a cpu reading instructions, represented with lights

[15:48:07] <vdamewood> Assembly language gets turned indo machine code.
[15:48:42] <deniska> At some point people had to write an assembler in machine code :)
[15:48:49] <vdamewood> C# gets turned into CLR bytecode, then CLR bytecode either gets handled by the CLR or translated to machien code.
[15:48:53] <CoderGuy> also I just found out that atleast one of these chips is 3d & rotateable on the simulation view

[15:54:59] <vdamewood> CoderGuy: There isn't really a way to say 'input the leter A', since the keyboard is what initiates the input. The keyboard sends an interrupt to the CPU, the CPU runs a handler routine for it, and gets a number representing the key pressed.

[15:57:54] <vdamewood> No. There is no instruction for wait for key pressed.
[15:58:06] <deniska> (at least not on IBM PC clones :P )
[15:58:20] <vdamewood> CoderGuy: The keyboard has a line into the CPU to hijack its input and make it run another routine.

[15:58:31] <GeDaMo> Keyboards usually contain a microcontroller, a small CPU which scans the keyswicthes and detects when they're pressed
[15:58:37] <arahael> CoderGuy: Basically your keyboard sends a bunch of binary numbers to the computer.  This computer has already been told which keyboard it is, so it knows what those numbers mean and converts them into scan codes.

[16:34:50] <arahael> And with the holes, you can set up wires that make contact by short circuiting through the holes.
[16:34:56] <CoderGuy> oh wow
[16:35:05] <CoderGuy> interesting
[16:35:07] <arahael> At least that's one way, there's probably others, such as using light detectors.
[16:35:18] <CoderGuy> hmmm ic ic
[16:35:23] <CoderGuy> wow okay it all kinda makes sense now
[16:35:35] <GeDaMo> There was also paper tape which could use a simpler reader

[22:06:18] <pyzozord> so AoC problems do not seem hard, if all they ever give you is just input of size less than 1000, you can always do O(n²) or even O(n³)... You can brute force yourself through most problems with input that small

[22:18:27] <CuriousErnestBro> my hypothesis is that they're iq tests
[22:18:43] <CuriousErnestBro> and no one wants a stupid person on their team
[22:18:53] <EdFletcher> they're a screening mechanism
[22:19:00] <EdFletcher> a broad one, at that
[22:19:09] <pyzozord> CuriousErnestBro: it's explained one quite in detail in Cracking the Coding interview book
[22:19:49] <EdFletcher> fizzbuzz is the perfect, canonical example: competent programmers laugh at the ease of it, whereas incompetent programmers will fail to complete it. takes a couple minutes to screen people one way or the other accordingly.
[22:20:03] <pyzozord> the tldr is google started it because they need some way to reduce the pool of applicants, and everyone copied google without thinking too much
[22:20:43] <EdFletcher> yeah, they needed a big screen because the volume of applicants was so high
[22:20:49] <CuriousErnestBro> EdFletcher fizzbuzz is fine, however not everyone needs to be an expert at algorithm design to do their job
[22:20:59] <pyzozord> originally it served a real purpose of testing for problem solving, but now people hyperoprimize for these interviews so it's kind of a pointless loop you have to participate in
[22:21:04] <CuriousErnestBro> and people say we have too few programmers...
[22:21:36] <EdFletcher> CuriousErnestBro: in fact _very few_ people need be experts at algorithm design to do this job! that's why these questions are ridiculous broadly-speaking (fwiw i believe we are very aligned on this)

[23:09:25] <macaw> pyzozord: May be in swap-hell.
[23:09:26] <oldlaptop> Depending on what you're doing, you may find that your linux has enough cross-toolchain stuff packaged for your needs already; for example, on debian: https://packages.debian.org/sid/gcc-mingw-w64-x86-64 (there are many other packages for g++/gfortran/whatever and "32-bit" windows versus "64-bit")
[23:10:08] <oldlaptop> MXE is a useful thing if you'll also need to cross-build some dependencies and/or your linux does not have mingw packaged for you.

[23:40:32] <CaCode> if i use counting sort to check if two same-length strings are palindroms and they are ascii characters only in c++ one byte each or 256, then instead of O(n+m) would the time complexity be O(n+256) and 256 being a constant so actually O(n)?
