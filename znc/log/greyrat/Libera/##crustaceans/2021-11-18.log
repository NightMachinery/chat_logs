[00:00:03] <gwozniak> What the higher-ups are/were missing is training any kind of model.  That part would be a fucking mess
[00:02:49] <gwozniak> But the black box of debugging such a monstrosity makes my blood curdle
[00:05:44] <mouseghost> Thanks for being part of the LinkedIn community - we're so glad you're here. As a thank you, we'd like to offer you one free month of LinkedIn Premium.
[00:13:47] <cot> What's the logic gate depicted on n-gate? Looks like an AND gate to me.
[00:14:08] <cot> unless it's a NAND with the circle missing or cut off
[00:20:15] <Brekkjern> What logic gate? I can't see any on the site?
[00:22:05] <imode> in the favicon?
[00:22:12] <imode> looks like an AND or a NAND.
[00:22:44] <cot> yeah, the favicon. but AND doesn't fit with the "we can't both be right" tagline.
[00:22:48] <Brekkjern> Oh. I have so many tabs open that I can barely see any favicons
[00:23:09] <imode> then it's NAND.
[00:23:10] <gerikson> ``If you are vegan and use Arch, what do you tell people first?''
[00:23:13] <imode> http://n-gate.com/favicon.ico
[00:23:17] <imode> gerikson: I use arch btw.
[00:23:40] <Brekkjern> Looks like a NAND to me
[00:23:52] <Brekkjern> It has the circle at the tip
[00:25:34] <gerikson> I can't believe I finished a main mission in Fallout 4 and didn't save
[00:25:53] <Brekkjern> It's so you can experience it all over again :)
[00:25:56] <gerikson> then got bopped by a super mutant
[00:27:57] <cot> Brekkjern: ah, I missed the tiny circle
[00:28:13] <Brekkjern> To be fair, it's only really visible if you zoom in...

[00:31:24] <buttsbot> Twatter - jennifer_fowlie - Apologies to the astrophysics student I met at a party years ago. When you were telling me how many hours a day you wer...
[00:32:01] <imode> hah
[00:40:30] <imode> I feel strangely at peace today.
[00:40:39] <imode> nice change of pace.
[00:41:17] <manicennui> So my voodoo curse didn't work.
[00:41:45] <imode> shame to say not.
[00:42:11] <manicennui> We have a team outing tonight. I'm not looking forward to it.
[00:46:55] <imode> why not?
[00:47:27] <manicennui> Frankly, they aren't very interesting people.
[00:47:33] <manicennui> And I don't really want to go out.
[00:48:00] <imode> then don't.
[00:48:21] <manicennui> I've been trying to come up with a good excuse.
[00:48:31] <imode> why have an excuse.
[00:48:40] <imode> just say "I won't be attending".
[00:48:52] <manicennui> I try to remain on good terms with my team.
[00:48:59] <manicennui> It's just like half a dozen of us.
[00:49:08] <imode> and you'd think that just not attending would put you on negative terms.
[00:49:17] <imode> why fake it. you're professionals.
[00:49:20] <manicennui> Humans like to be social.
[00:49:22] <dminkovsky> woah apple approved the latest version of my app in under an hour
[00:49:24] <imode> not all of us.
[00:49:33] <dminkovsky> good afternoon
[00:49:34] <manicennui> imode: Sure, but most of them.
[00:49:42] <imode> just say that you won't be going. if prompted why, just say you don't feel up to it.
[00:49:51] <imode> your time is not owned by others.
[00:49:56] <manicennui> I'd be fine with only seeing the same handful of people once per week for the rest of my life.
[00:50:00] <manicennui> But I wouldn't choose my coworkers.
[00:51:12] <dminkovsky> imode: are you off?
[00:51:14] <dminkovsky> i mean, from work
[00:51:17] <imode> nah.
[00:51:25] <dminkovsky> well that's doubly better
[00:51:29] <imode> have to do some additional architecting.
[00:51:31] <dminkovsky> feeling at peace and at work
[00:51:37] <imode> indeed.
[00:51:41] <manicennui> I need to figure out a way to make software engineer money with almost no human interaction.
[00:51:48] <dminkovsky> drop shipping
[00:52:06] <dminkovsky> (lolol)
[00:52:17] <imode> my little expert system doesn't understand/can't reach outside of its bubble to see what other invocations of it are working on/generating, so I use up tons of WCUs in Dynamo to dedup a bunch of data.
[00:52:25] <manicennui> I actually think I would enjoy doing some kind of online store.
[00:52:26] <dminkovsky> manicennui: wait you seriously need to go to a work outing?
[00:52:36] <manicennui> dminkovsky: Need is a strong word.
[00:52:47] <imode> putting all of that into a FIFO SQS queue would do deuping on the 5m horizon, and I can set up a lambda to do the writes.
[00:52:50] <dminkovsky> manicennui: 1) covid? 2) aren't you concerned about covid?
[00:52:57] <manicennui> dminkovsky: Minimally.
[00:53:06] <dminkovsky> so ppl in chicago are like, "it's over"?
[00:53:17] <klardotsh> s/chicago/america/ IME
[00:53:28] <dminkovsky> gah
[00:53:34] <dminkovsky> my wife is going to get recalled to her job in new york
[00:53:37] <klardotsh> we're "done" in Seattle too for better or worse, albeit with a mask and vax mandate to go anywhere in public
[00:53:46] <imode> I'm not "done".
[00:53:54] <imode> and I live in mukilteo lmao.
[00:54:04] <dminkovsky> manicennui: what is the setting for this
[00:54:07] <imode> y'all keep pretending this thing isn't trying to kill you, I'll keep my family safe.
[00:54:07] <manicennui> The thing is, it's difficult to distinguish my normal behavior from my pandemic behavior.
[00:54:17] <manicennui> dminkovsky: A brewpub.
[00:54:31] <dminkovsky> elephant and castle?
[00:54:36] <manicennui> No.
[00:54:38] <dminkovsky> :)
[00:54:38] <klardotsh> imode: heh, "we're" in the sense of what I sense to be a majority around here, not in an absolute of 100%.
[00:54:42] <Xe> manicennui: "i was attending to a personal matter"
[00:54:42] <manicennui> We have more than one!
[00:54:53] <dminkovsky> manicennui: i know you're from the land of brewpubs
[00:55:11] <manicennui> Elephant and Castle is a chain too, isn't it?
[00:55:11] <imode> I'd rather just have pizza and nerd out over drones or something.
[00:55:17] <dminkovsky> the pandemic being over is really stressful
[00:55:21] <manicennui> imode: This place serves really great pizza.
[00:55:26] <manicennui> And their beer is good.
[00:55:30] <manicennui> Those are the two things I want.
[00:55:34] <imode> meh. if I wanna get drunk I'll do it at home.
[00:55:51] <dminkovsky> i wish i had even one friend who wanted to nerd out
[00:55:55] <dminkovsky> i have 0 nerd friends

[00:56:08] <buttsbot> George Thorogood And The Destroyers - I Drink Alone - YouTube - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpzqQst-Sg8
[00:56:12] <imode> come out west dude.
[00:56:14] <manicennui> dminkovsky: I have a couple.
[00:56:15] <imode> we'll start a makerspace.
[00:56:32] <manicennui> I have only spent time with friends once since the pandemic started.
[00:56:35] <imode> try to reverse the effects of the seattle freeze.
[00:56:50] <manicennui> Fuck the West Coast.
[00:56:53] <dminkovsky> only if it attracts ppl who will fix my toaster over that i'm sure isn't actually broken but needs a new capacitor somewhere
[00:56:54] <imode> agreed.
[00:57:10] <manicennui> I want to take a trip to New England next summer.
[00:57:17] <manicennui> I've been interested in VT/NH for a long time.
[00:57:21] <manicennui> I feel like that is the place for me.
[00:57:23] <imode> come to maine.
[00:57:27] <Brekkjern> I should pop by a hackerspace or something
[00:57:27] <imode> like everyone else.
[00:57:30] <manicennui> ME is interesting too.
[00:57:33] <imode> grew up there.
[00:57:34] <Brekkjern> Not sure what I'd do there, but...
[00:57:36] <imode> 20 years.
[00:58:14] <manicennui> I want to live in a cabin in the woods, bake bread, make beer, garden, listen to music whenever I want as loudly as I want...
[00:58:43] <imode> that's the dream.
[00:58:52] <Brekkjern> I wouldn't mind having a house out in the woods with a nice view and all that, but I'd hate to garden
[00:59:00] <manicennui> I really think I have life figured out at this point, but I just need to do it.
[00:59:05] <manicennui> Nothing I want is difficult.
[00:59:07] <Brekkjern> That's one of the things I like about having an apartment. No fucking garden to tend.
[00:59:12] <imode> it'll be difficult to find.
[00:59:24] <manicennui> Difficult to find what?
[00:59:35] <imode> the place, the land.
[00:59:38] <manicennui> Nah.
[00:59:40] <imode> mm.
[00:59:43] <imode> sure.
[00:59:45] <manicennui> I make software engineer money.
[00:59:54] <imode> yyyeah, so do I.
[00:59:59] <imode> but I've lived there.
[01:00:01] <imode> have you?
[01:00:09] <manicennui> Worst case scenario is I do this for another 3-5 years to save more.
[01:00:14] <manicennui> No.
[01:00:21] <imode> then trust me, it's hard to find a spot.
[01:00:29] <manicennui> In what way?
[01:00:38] <imode> new england is experiencing what we'll call the yuppie migration.
[01:00:47] <manicennui> There are tons of potential spots online.
[01:00:56] <manicennui> So I'm curious what you think the problem would be.
[01:00:58] <imode> none of which will be available at a reasonable price.
[01:01:04] <manicennui> Yeah, I'm one of those yuppies.
[01:01:12] <imode> great. get out of my home state.
[01:01:14] <manicennui> I have the money to pay unreasonable prices.
[01:01:24] <manicennui> Your home state is IL?
[01:01:30] <imode> nah, it's ME.
[01:01:40] <manicennui> I haven't been looking in ME.
[01:01:44] <imode> good, don't.
[01:01:49] <manicennui> Portland definitely seems trendier.
[01:01:57] <imode> go for it, it's close enough to boston to be a part of boston.
[01:02:06] <manicennui> I'm thinking VT or western MA.
[01:02:14] <ngoldbaum> it turns out everywhere that anyone would ever vaguely want to move to is experiencing this
[01:02:28] <imode> yeah.
[01:02:31] <manicennui> But I need to visit next year first.
[01:02:39] <imode> and it's crowding out the actual citizens.
[01:02:51] <imode> $60k/yr in ME, you live like a fucking king.
[01:03:16] <imode> hell my family rented a 3bd house at $1.2k/mo for 6 years.
[01:03:26] <imode> overlooked the ocean.
[01:04:11] * manicennui buys that house and turns it into an airbnb.
[01:04:26] <imode> you'd be battling a millionaire for it.
[01:04:34] <manicennui> I was kidding anyways.
[01:04:34] <imode> trust me, she'll gut you.
[01:04:43] <imode> that lady was ruuuuthless.
[01:04:48] <imode> good person to have on your side.
[01:04:52] <manicennui> I can take an old lady.
[01:05:01] <imode> not one from boston lmao.
[01:05:05] <imode> she was a piece of work.
[01:05:22] <imode> probably the only rich person I could actually relate to and like.
[01:05:56] <imode> made her fortune in finance. made herself a lovely pad and just started buying up properties for rent.
[01:06:29] <imode> her husband gave me some very vintage computing hardware.
[01:06:40] <imode> shame we didn't stay.
[01:07:35] <manicennui> https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/1679-White-Rd-Corinth-VT-05039/92013262_zpid/
[01:07:37] <buttsbot> 1679 White Rd, Corinth, VT 05039 | MLS #4887730 | Zillow
[01:08:21] <imode> not a bad spot.
[01:08:29] <imode> how far from the nearest store.
[01:08:46] <Brekkjern> Like, I understand what a square foot is, but when I see that number I just have no idea what I am looking at :P
[01:08:57] <imode> "large".
[01:09:14] <imode> wood furnace, hope it's kalamazoo brand.
[01:09:18] <Brekkjern> Yeah, but like... I have a 52m2 apartment. That number makes sense to me
[01:09:32] <manicennui> Looks like about 10 miles or so.
[01:09:35] <imode> 11 acres ain't too shabby.
[01:09:35] <Brekkjern> But 1000 something? Eh?
[01:10:32] <manicennui> Ideally I'd just buy land and have something built exactly the way I want it.
[01:10:44] <manicennui> I'd probably go sub 2k square feet.
[01:11:08] <manicennui> I like the garage on that property.
[01:11:12] <imode> tbf I'd do that right there, you at least have something you can expand. log cabins are lovely.
[01:11:14] <manicennui> Could use it for a gym.
[01:11:25] <imode> they'll last much, _much_ longer than a traditional house.
[01:11:28] <imode> against much worse weather.
[01:11:52] <manicennui> I like the look of timberframe buildings a lot, but I don't know much about their performance.
[01:12:05] <imode> my folks own a log cabin, I stayed there from like, 04 to 08.
[01:12:07] <Brekkjern> Wow... Zillow confuses me greatly. Is it common that most listings only have a few pictures?
[01:12:25] <manicennui> Brekkjern: Maybe 8-10 for most places.
[01:12:29] <imode> it was built in the 80s, we haven't had to do much if anything. no constant upkeep.
[01:12:32] <manicennui> It is confusing to me too when the prices get really high.
[01:12:45] <manicennui> Should be like 5 photos per $100k.
[01:12:56] <imode> are we still in the artificially inflated territory of real-estate prices, $440k isn't that much.
[01:13:13] <manicennui> Like they can't be bothered to take more photos to try and sell their $500k+ home.
[01:13:14] <imode> unless that's over the conforming loan limit.
[01:13:34] <imode> it's not, that's $100k less, but you could be bidding past $440k.
[01:13:59] <imode> if you break that you'll be carrying worse rates.
[01:14:00] <manicennui> imode: My advantage is I don't have to buy anything.
[01:14:06] <Brekkjern> This is a pretty run of the mill listing around here: https://www.finn.no/realestate/homes/ad.html?finnkode=239053130
[01:14:07] <buttsbot> Lys og delikat leilighet - Stor vestvendt balkong på 8,5 kvm | Kjøkken fra 2020 | Populært område | FINN.no
[01:14:14] <manicennui> Not going to get into a bidding war with anyone.
[01:14:26] <imode> I mean, if you want a house/land, that's the procedure.
[01:14:27] <klardotsh> my "get the hell out of dodge" plan is a small (<700sqft probably) log cabin in the rainy panhandle of alaska, probably a workshop, and tentatively a few more cabins on the lot for friends to live in if they took up the invite. the trick to affordability is clearly to go places so cold and wet nobody wants anything to do with it :P
[01:14:29] <imode> you kinda have to buy something.
[01:14:31] <Brekkjern> It's weird to see the difference in how places get sold in various places
[01:14:51] <manicennui> imode: I didn't have to fight anyone to buy this place.
[01:15:01] <manicennui> They accepted my first offer.
[01:15:07] <imode> that's great. that's not everywhere lmfao.
[01:15:11] <manicennui> Sure.
[01:15:12] <imode> and certainly not the places you're looking.
[01:15:16] <imode> source: I've been looking.
[01:15:24] <manicennui> imode: That place has been on the market for a month.
[01:15:29] <imode> cool, go buy it.
[01:15:42] <manicennui> Not going to buy anything without visiting the state.
[01:16:00] <imode> hope you like winter.
[01:16:16] <imode> or own a snowplow/snowblower.
[01:16:20] <manicennui> Brekkjern: 43 photos is really high.
[01:16:40] <manicennui> Brekkjern: Most listings I've looked at are 8-10, and the good ones will have 20-25.
[01:16:41] <Brekkjern> manicennui: That's about average around here. Maybe a bit on the higher side of it
[01:17:26] <manicennui> imode: Obviously I'd own proper equipment if I needed to deal with such things.
[01:17:28] <Brekkjern> I've seen listings with just a handful, but they are anomalies
[01:17:33] <manicennui> Right now I'm in a condo so it is taken care of.
[01:18:01] <imode> enjoy chopping wood.
[01:18:16] <manicennui> imode: I actually want my life to be (physically) harder.
[01:18:22] <manicennui> I think avoiding physical labor is a mistake.
[01:18:44] <imode> you'd be surprised how intensive that actually is.
[01:18:48] <manicennui> And no, I'm not advocating for people to abuse their bodies for work.
[01:18:53] <imode> and if you break down, nobody's chopping it for you.
[01:19:01] <manicennui> I don't think I'd be surprised, but I'm definitely not in shape for it now.
[01:19:12] <manicennui> I realize how hard it is.
[01:19:34] <imode> haaaave you ever chopped a couple cords of wood for winter.
[01:19:40] <manicennui> I haven't made any definite plans at this point, just a general direction.
[01:19:45] <imode> in summer.
[01:20:07] <Brekkjern> "Just" get a hydraulic splitter
[01:20:14] <Brekkjern> Makes it fairly easy
[01:20:17] <imode> heh.
[01:20:21] <manicennui> Wood boys should be a thing.
[01:20:23] <imode> or pre-chopped.. some places will do that.
[01:20:38] <imode> my father and I used to chop our own wood. we'd have the logs delivered.
[01:20:42] <Brekkjern> Rather common in Norway. You buy firewood either by the bag or by the trailer load
[01:20:48] <manicennui> Yeah, I've definitely seen people getting an entire truckful of wood delivered.
[01:21:10] <imode> if we needed any more we'd just cut it off the property. not that I'd support that.
[01:21:42] <manicennui> Can be done if it is managed (yes, I know it is not easy).
[01:21:51] <imode> you'll also need to vet your wood furnace.
[01:22:38] <imode> ours had like, no moving parts. I don't think they make 'em like that any more.
[01:22:50] <imode> just a simple funnel and vent system to push hot air up.
[01:23:51] <drakonis> https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/guix-devel/2021-11/msg00082.html the right time to run guix approaches...
[01:23:51] <buttsbot> Thursday 18th: ‘core-updates-frozen’ sprint!
[01:24:02] <manicennui> I can't imagine being a Viking living in a tent.
[01:24:28] <imode> you get used to it. and you have someone tending the fire. always.
[01:24:40] <manicennui> Fire boy.
[01:24:47] <imode> fireperson these days.
[01:24:50] <manicennui> Yeah, work those logs.
[01:24:55] <imode> lmfao.
[01:25:32] <imode> I appreciate the convenience of living in reliance of others, but would like to make enough money to be selective about that reliance.
[01:25:33] <dminkovsky> just got an email from NPM saying they care about securing the software supply chain so i should enable 2FA. which is true, i'm doing that right now; but, cmon you guys
[01:25:52] <imode> didn't M$ release a similar statement.
[01:25:56] <imode> on github.
[01:26:13] <ngoldbaum> pellet furnaces are a lot more efficient
[01:26:24] <dminkovsky> about NPM or what
[01:26:26] <manicennui> imode: That is basically my goal. I don't have any delusions about how difficult a lot of these things can be, and I can afford to make many of them easier.
[01:26:28] <imode> yeh, about NPM.
[01:26:29] <dminkovsky> also +1 for M$ always enjoy that
[01:26:36] <dminkovsky> yeah i bet they did
[01:26:43] <manicennui> Most of the places I'm looking at also don't rely on a wood furnace as their main source of heat.
[01:27:13] <manicennui> They are not actually log cabins.
[01:27:56] <imode> imo in the NE you need one of those.
[01:28:03] <imode> regular construction just doesn't cut it.
[01:28:16] <imode> be prepared to drive on absolute shit-tier roads too.
[01:28:31] <imode> think ice storms, 5 feet of snow within a few weeks, and freezing temps.
[01:32:59] <manicennui> And yetis.
[01:56:15] *** Quits: dcz (~dcz@user/dcz) (Ping timeout: 250 seconds)
[01:57:52] <dminkovsky> is there anything more scary than applying a DB migration??
[01:58:19] <mouseghost> dminkovsky, doing it without migrations
[01:58:40] <dminkovsky> heh
[01:58:49] <dminkovsky> i'm not even sure about that
[01:58:53] <dminkovsky> lol
[01:59:02] <dminkovsky> it's definitely the /wrong/ thing to do, but is it less scary?
[01:59:12] <dminkovsky> i mean, more scary
[01:59:43] <dminkovsky> hello mouseghost
[01:59:49] <mouseghost> hello dminkovsky
[01:59:55] <dminkovsky> i still haven't looked for that book for you
[02:00:00] <dminkovsky> i am sorry, i've been busy
[02:00:02] <mouseghost> ah dont worry
[02:00:08] <dminkovsky> it's the best book
[02:00:13] <mouseghost> to be fair, i forgot all about it
[02:00:20] <dminkovsky> that's great, even better
[02:00:21] <mouseghost> ahh, if its best then you are obliged to tell me the title :P
[02:00:33] <dminkovsky> i don't remember the title that's the problem
[02:00:55] <dminkovsky> and all finance books have the same name lol
[02:01:02] <dminkovsky> value blah blah
[02:02:45] <Brekkjern> Man, it's much more difficult to learn a new language than one first believes...
[02:03:02] <dminkovsky> what are you looking at
[02:03:31] <drakonis> it depends on the language
[02:03:40] <Brekkjern> I mean... I remember spending like 5 years trying to learn German, and I still can't speak it worth shit, but I kiiinda expected to know a bit more after more than half a year of learning Russian
[02:04:13] <dminkovsky> oh you mean a human langauge
[02:04:19] <Brekkjern> Yeah :P
[02:04:25] <dminkovsky> context-full language
[02:04:49] <dminkovsky> gotta immers
[02:04:51] <dminkovsky> e
[02:04:55] <Brekkjern> Yeah
[02:05:05] <dminkovsky> i really want to spend some time living in ukraine
[02:05:20] <dminkovsky> i'd live in russia if they got rid of putin/the political situation change
[02:05:21] <Brekkjern> I was planning on playing Escape From Tarkov with the interface set to Russian, but figuring out what the quests want me to do was hard :P
[02:05:30] <drakonis> play stalker instead
[02:05:38] <dminkovsky> quests?
[02:05:51] <Brekkjern> Yeah
[02:06:18] <Brekkjern> EFT has tasks for the various traders you have to do to level them up to get access to more gear
[02:06:57] <dminkovsky> oh it's a game my bad
[02:07:04] <dminkovsky> misunderstood you
[02:07:06] <Brekkjern> Yeah :)
[02:07:20] <dminkovsky> cyrillic is hard man!
[02:07:25] <drakonis> https://redgem.games/wigmaker/
[02:07:25] <buttsbot> wigmaker
[02:07:25] <Brekkjern> Hehe
[02:07:57] <Brekkjern> I feel like I have a decent grasp of the alphabet, but reading and understanding complex stuff is hard when you only know around 500 words...
[02:08:37] <dminkovsky> it's a really nice language. tbh i like it a lot more than english
[02:09:10] <dminkovsky> i'd suggest you live in russia but, i wouldnt myself, so :)
[02:09:24] <Brekkjern> Eh. I have no plans for that :P
[02:09:46] <Brekkjern> I've been to Moscow once, but it was a long time ago
[02:09:48] <dminkovsky> get a russian wife?
[02:09:52] <Brekkjern> Hah
[02:09:52] <dminkovsky> or partner
[02:10:04] <Brekkjern> Nah. I'm just learning it because it is interesting
[02:10:07] <dminkovsky> :)
[02:10:57] <dminkovsky> i'd like to learn german
[02:11:11] <dminkovsky> and i'd live in germany/austria so
[02:11:24] <Brekkjern> It could help if you do :P
[02:13:16] <dminkovsky> norwegian is so non-germanic that german was hard?
[02:13:31] <Brekkjern> It's close-ish
[02:13:34] <dminkovsky> which is closer to german; english or norwegian?
[02:13:43] <Brekkjern> Eh
[02:13:49] <Brekkjern> Norwegian I guess
[02:14:08] <Brekkjern> But both languages stem from the same family of languages
[02:14:22] <Brekkjern> It's just that English has more influence from French
[02:14:52] <dminkovsky> i mean hitler didn't consider it fitting to annihilate neither the norwegians nor the english :)
[02:15:10] <dminkovsky> and norwegian just diverged w/o external influence?
[02:16:23] <dminkovsky> i hate deploying shit
[02:16:35] <dminkovsky> so stressful even w/ testing and kubernetes and shit
[02:16:47] <Brekkjern> Eh, Norwegian is two language family branches away from German I think
[02:16:55] <dminkovsky> really
[02:17:23] <dminkovsky> i'll have to look that up
[02:17:24] <Brekkjern> I'm not a linguist though, so this isn't my speciality :P
[02:17:44] <dminkovsky> how'd you end up in moscow?
[02:18:46] <Brekkjern> Norwegian, Swedish, and to some extent Danish is mutually intelligible for Scandinavians. German has a lot of similar words because of the common ancestry, but the grammar is a bit different and it branched a long time ago so there are changes to the languages that don't reflect in the others.
[02:19:37] <Brekkjern> My father worked for a huge Norwegian oil company and they were doing some cooperative stuff with Gazprom I believe it was, so he was over in Moscow for half a year.
[02:19:55] <Brekkjern> We visited for a holiday over there
[02:21:15] <dminkovsky> cool!
[02:21:34] <dminkovsky> i haven't been to russia myself, i am from ukraine. would love to see it
[02:21:55] <indigo> Moscow is really cool, I like the metro
[02:21:57] <Brekkjern> Moscow was pretty cool.
[02:22:00] <Brekkjern> Yeah

[02:27:07] <indigo> Sadly a lot of the time things are lost in translation
[02:27:32] <dminkovsky> of course, but w/ a good movie it's better to see it than not at all. is my opinion

[02:28:08] <indigo> Oh yeah for sure!
[02:28:09] <dminkovsky> sometimes the captions are even decent
[02:30:30] <Brekkjern> I'd like to play the game set to Russian to learn, but the text is a bit too complicated still
[02:32:10] <Brekkjern> Also, for some dumb reason, the search system is set to the interface language, so when you try to search for items using the english name it won't work
[02:32:24] <Brekkjern> That makes it really difficult to buy things from the market...
[02:32:48] <dminkovsky> yeah i have my phone in russian and that's half the fun
[02:32:55] <dminkovsky> opening apps using spotlight or whatever it's called in ios
[02:33:11] <dminkovsky> got to switch to the russian keyboard and start typing in russian. it's dedication
[02:33:24] <Brekkjern> Yeah. It doesn't seem like many software developers have much love for bilingual people :S
[02:33:24] <dminkovsky> only immersion i get though :(
[02:33:24] <buttsbot> 👏 developers 👏 developers 👏 developers 👏
[02:33:33] <dminkovsky> well i appreciate what it forces me to do
[02:33:44] <Brekkjern> Hehe
[02:33:52] <dminkovsky> i bet most russians are trying to search in russian :)
[02:34:32] <Brekkjern> Probably
[02:34:57] <Brekkjern> But it's annoying that I don't get results for the english name when I search
[02:36:37] <dminkovsky> yeah i guess the iphone does do that for some apps
[02:36:51] <dminkovsky> i can pull up the calculator with "cal-" even with the phone in russian

[02:47:39] <buttsbot> Eternal Legends Update (Patch 0.8.4) - Coming December 10th - Announcements - Last Epoch Forums
[03:05:10] <hoistbypetard> i suppose something like this was inevitable: https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/32650662/staples-center-become-cryptocom-arena-rich-naming-rights-deal
[03:05:10] <buttsbot> Staples Center to become Crypto.com Arena in reported $700 million naming rights deal
[03:08:26] <hoistbypetard> i'm probably too stupid to see how spending the kind of promotional money they're spending is compatible with the service they offer to "Buy crypto at true cost"... they must have margins somewhere to manage multiple giant naming rights deals
[03:10:40] <Brekkjern> I bet they do what banks do with the money you put into their accounts
[03:12:24] <Brekkjern> I mean... Your account is just a number. The bank just promises to have money on hand to let you withdraw up to that number. Not everyone is doing that at the same time, so while that happens they can use your money to give out loans, invest, etc.
[03:12:46] <hoistbypetard> Sure
[03:12:57] <hoistbypetard> but usually there's a fee to get euros into my dollar-denominated account
[03:13:12] <hoistbypetard> or a commission to convert securities into dollars to put them in my account
[03:14:05] <hoistbypetard> If they're doing that without similar charges, they must be banking on crypto only ever going up. by quite a bit...
[03:14:06] <Brekkjern> Sure, but that's just banks doing things to incentivize behaviour they want you to do for reasons
[03:14:17] <Brekkjern> Yeah
[03:27:56] <gwozniak> oh dear god (that staples center thing)
[03:31:35] <indigo> hoistbypetard: Oh God I was trying to avoid thinking about that today
[03:31:45] <indigo> I live in LA and this is terrible
[03:32:30] <gwozniak> Also, the financial site that holds my retirement savings with got 2FA. That's good! But it's a code via SMS. Ugh.
[03:33:04] <indigo> Better than nothing, I guess
[03:34:03] <hoistbypetard> It’s better than NOT making someone SIM swap you to take over your account

[03:44:02] <indigo> Oh wow, I finally *get* Forth
[04:14:46] <gwozniak> So I tried ccls instead of clangd
[04:15:10] <gwozniak> Total and complete failure.  The logs were full of "clang crashed building X"
[04:15:17] <gwozniak> So the hell with that mess
[04:19:50] <prussian> Clangd is basically the only one that seems usable
[04:20:06] <prussian> As far as I can tell
[04:22:33] <dminkovsky> we should only code in C/CPP and .... JS?
[04:22:50] <prussian> Whoa...
[04:23:04] <dminkovsky> i've expended all my weekly trolled-by-HN energy
[04:23:39] <prussian> I think that crypto.com thing and being the only person who can Google compile errors did that to me as well.
[04:24:06] <prussian> I should just quit with zero notice and full blown grind leetcode for M$ interview
[04:24:12] <prussian> Man I'm gonna fail so hard.
[04:24:53] <dminkovsky> when is it
[04:25:04] <dminkovsky> the ask leetcode for devops?
[04:25:11] <prussian> I don't know yet lol. I'm taking next week all off.
[04:25:24] <prussian> No I'm applying for storage team in Hyper-V
[04:25:40] <prussian> So I guess I gotta get my NVMe skills up too?
[04:25:45] <prussian> Not that I have any
[04:26:00] <prussian> Tired of devoops
[04:26:04] <prussian> It's time to code.
[04:26:04] <dminkovsky> i don't even know what NVMe is
[04:26:12] <dminkovsky> isn't that like some storage interface
[04:27:21] <prussian> Yeah
[04:27:55] <prussian> Azure wants to provide some paid for services around nvm and offloading code onto these custom storage accelerator cards
[04:28:06] <prussian> So idk.
[04:28:44] <prussian> I don't know nothing about Azure, Hyper-V, Windows or whatever.
[04:28:51] <prussian> So it will be an interesting interview

[04:33:07] <dminkovsky> there's, like, 800
[04:33:07] <prussian> I guess I should study up c++ memory model and maybe make some toy work queues

[18:16:36] <dminkovsky> that's the greatest feeling companion_cube, congratulations <3
[18:16:59] <dminkovsky> around week 1 or week 2 i thought "i can't even imagine this things being 1 year old"
[18:17:10] <Brekkjern> companion_cube: Congrats on your child beating infant mortality :)
[18:17:13] <dminkovsky> <3 <3 <3
[18:17:26] <dminkovsky> Brekkjern: it's not even so hard in the modern world :)
[18:17:29] <dminkovsky> the hard thing is not killing it
[18:17:30] <Brekkjern> True
[18:17:33] <Brekkjern> Hahaha
[18:17:39] <Brekkjern> Or letting it kill itself I guess
[18:17:43] <companion_cube> :D yeah, it's great
[18:17:44] <dminkovsky> yes basically
[18:17:54] <companion_cube> we got her a balloon
[18:18:04] <dminkovsky> hehehe does she like it?
[18:18:06] <companion_cube> she's kind of fascinated by it :D
[18:19:09] <dminkovsky> :) congrats companion_cube
[18:19:16] <dminkovsky> going to try to give her cake?
[18:19:16] <Brekkjern> Balloons are fucking awesome though
[18:19:41] <companion_cube> nah, we're not strong enough for a baby sugar rush + crash
[18:19:56] <companion_cube> the first year is definitely wild
[18:20:07] <dminkovsky> ours had literally 0 refined sugar before we tried giving him cake on his first birthday
[18:20:16] <dminkovsky> we tried a little to see what happened; he didn't even want it
[18:20:37] <dminkovsky> definitely wild!
[18:21:12] <companion_cube> exactly, sugar is crack
[18:21:23] <dminkovsky> it is
[18:21:31] <companion_cube> today is the nice birthday day
[18:21:37] <companion_cube> tomorrow is the bad 12m checkup
[18:21:39] <companion_cube> 😂
[18:21:40] <dminkovsky> oy
[18:21:50] <dminkovsky> those are the worst. my kid still screams non-stop the whole time
[18:22:04] <dminkovsky> his 6 month checkup was really chill and then it all went to shit from there
[18:22:22] <companion_cube> oof, yeah, I'm not eager to see that
[18:22:46] <dminkovsky> maybe if yours is in daycare it's chill? ours kid is really afraid of people and the doctor
[18:23:22] <dminkovsky> (bparker is missing some hot, steamy furry talk here)
[18:23:42] <companion_cube> she's fine with daycare, but, well, she'll remember the poor doctor
[18:23:50] <dminkovsky> hehehe yeah
[18:24:03] <companion_cube> or even the place, I'm not sure
[18:24:14] <companion_cube> … "I remember this place… nothing good happens here"
[18:24:16] <kline> im not particularly hot on furry stuff
[18:24:24] <kline> its a good way to filter people out though
[18:24:25] <companion_cube> you'd be if you were in a fursuit
[18:24:31] <companion_cube> these things seem super hot
[18:24:47] <companion_cube> does bparker think "C is based" is a compliment?
[18:25:09] <dminkovsky> kline: yet somehow you manage to stay here
[18:25:35] <dminkovsky> is it... a sense of humor? a willingness to be interact with people who may not be like yourself?
[18:28:11] <ngoldbaum> that’s what the baleen in the whalesuit is for
[18:28:14] <ngoldbaum> filtering
[18:29:16] <dminkovsky> companion_cube: so any plans?
[18:29:56] <kline> dminkovsky, any channel that false flags stuff to keep delicate souls out is of interest to me
[18:30:00] <companion_cube> not really, just unwrapping gifts tonight
[18:30:13] <companion_cube> but we're def. celebrating :)
[18:30:25] <ngoldbaum> saying that things are “based” is a good filter for me
[18:30:40] <companion_cube> same
[18:30:46] <companion_cube> or, a nice red flag

[18:32:42] <edk> i know lots of people who are nice and call things based
[18:34:33] <companion_cube> I think I've mostly heard it as opposed to "woke"
[18:34:52] <companion_cube> which is generally a sign of being far to the right, imho
[18:35:20] <kline> sneed
[18:35:56] <edk> it's entirely plausible that there's a correlation but there's also lots of people who aren't far-right who use it
[18:36:28] <companion_cube> oh ok, TIL
[18:36:33] <kline> i dont really like the idea of identity politics salting the earth of swathes of languages
[18:36:34] <companion_cube> I guess it depends on your circles…

[18:36:51] <edk> well sort of but words spread
[18:37:05] <companion_cube> like that time when 👌 got appropriated by nazis
[18:37:24] <edk> exposure to 4chan memer words doesn't even always mean someone's a 4chan user, much less that they're a nazi
[18:37:54] <dminkovsky> there aren't many nazis out there
[18:37:56] <kline> companion_cube, you know it was almost exclusively done as a joke to see how many people decided that it was appropriated
[18:38:02] <edk> god i'm going to look like such a centrist idiot if this person turns out to be a nazi
[18:38:53] <companion_cube> :D
[18:38:56] <kline> its along the same lines as saying "sneed" a lot and laughing when people decide it must be a slur against "special needs"
[18:39:04] <kline> its just a joke from the simpsons
[18:39:19] <companion_cube> words evolve…
[18:39:28] <ngoldbaum> owning the libs via linguistics
[18:39:46] <ngoldbaum> chomsky and all his lib-owning
[18:40:32] <kline> companion_cube, words do evolve, but the outrage of sneed being a slur against special needs is entirely synthetic by people who didnt understand what it was meant trying to fill the vacuum by assuming it must be something bad because of the people using it
[18:41:11] <kline> 4chan people were using it as a forced meme internally (and then externally), and the only people who linked it to special needs were extremely online anti-4chan people
[18:41:45] <companion_cube> I have no opinion on "sneed"
[18:41:49] <kline> in this regards, its actually the people who want to be supporters of equality who have coined a new slur, which is kind of amusing

[20:55:05] <gwozniak> I am living that
[20:56:55] <gwozniak> I managed to do my debugging presentation (tips for debugging GCC) at work without boring everyone to death, so now I'm going to get some lunch
[20:57:13] <indigo> Nice!
[20:57:32] <gwozniak> Then write to a customer and say, "Uh, why are you altering the logs you're sending me?"
[20:57:57] <gwozniak> Makes it hard to debug your problem when you change the output

[21:27:38] <manicennui> Damn.
[21:27:51] <manicennui> That looks incredible.
[21:40:04] <nyarmith> manicennui: accurate devops description
[22:29:05] <ngoldbaum> ah good i’m glad my laptop is applying firmware updates now right before a meeting
[22:30:36] <edm> i find just as you’re giving a virtual presentation is a good time too
[22:32:44] <Xe> i usually prerecord my virtual presentations for that reason
[22:34:02] <indigo> ngoldbaum: Macbook?
[22:34:54] <ngoldbaum> xps 13 running ubuntu
[22:35:14] <Brekkjern> Man... Fuck scheme.
[22:35:19] <Brekkjern> And Lisp by extension
[22:35:38] <manicennui> !!!
[22:36:08] <indigo> LEAVE LISP ALONE
[22:36:21] <dminkovsky> hashtag
[22:37:25] <Brekkjern> I'd leave it alone if I could...
[22:43:54] <indigo> So none of the replacement credit cards that my wife has requested have arrived
[22:44:20] <indigo> She called customer service for her credit union this morning and apparently our address is too long for the system to process replacement cards
[22:44:29] <indigo> Wat
[22:44:56] <gwozniak> ...
[22:45:29] <indigo> It's a pretty simple address... four digit street number, street name, and three digit apartment number
[22:45:34] <riv> Brekkjern: whats the problem?
[22:45:43] <indigo> Maybe they forgot to put the apartment number on line 2 or something
[22:45:58] <indigo> But like... how can the address be valid in the system for some use case, but not for others
[22:46:29] <indigo> All of her credit card statements were getting there OK, but the cards weren't
[22:46:34] <Brekkjern> riv: Task for uni. I have to modify this meta-evaluator to support (if <test1> then <exp1> elsif <test2> then <exp2> else <exp3>)
[22:46:42] <Brekkjern> With an arbitrary number of elsifs
[22:46:49] <riv> that's ...really not lispy
[22:46:50] <kline> indigo, the card manufacturer is probably different from the statement printer
[22:47:01] <kline> who probably have different label printing setups
[22:47:03] <Brekkjern> riv: I don't think the point is the syntax to be honest :P
[22:47:10] <riv> having infix keywords
[22:47:40] <gwozniak> At least you don't have to implement the LOOP macro ;)
[22:47:47] <gwozniak> side note: love LOOP
[22:47:57] <Brekkjern> You say that...
[22:47:59] <riv> you could just do a simple list processing function on its own that converts that input to (if <test1> <exp1> (if <test2> <exp2> <exp3>))
[22:48:12] <riv> this is relatively easy to implement and test in isolation
[22:48:27] <Brekkjern> Hmm. Yes.
[22:48:28] <riv> and it's kind of like adding a (runtime expanded) macro to your interpreter
[22:51:49] <indigo> kline: That makes sense, but is still very confusing
[22:53:00] <kline> its confusing, but not unexplainable
[22:53:08] <kline> credit unions are small, both of these things will be outsourced
[22:53:40] <kline> (small in the financial sense, even though some have thousands of customers - they wont be a card issuer, instead fobbing it off to visa/mastercard etc)
[22:54:12] <kline> a big enough union might do their own statement postage but thats relatively not-core-business
[22:54:34] <manicennui> Even at a large bank, there are usually dozens of different systems that they have stitched together over time.
[22:54:50] <riv> ive been on lobsters for a while but i have no idea what its actually for
[22:55:06] <cb_> computer shit beep boop

[22:57:40] <manicennui> This is the off topic channel though.
[22:57:51] <manicennui> Should we yell at people who talk about things that are on topic?

[23:23:58] <gthm> I need to either setup znc or tmux+irssi+tailscale on my vm so I can stop IRCing like a peasant
[23:24:22] <riv> I think I did most of MIT 6.002 but that was a while ago
[23:30:29] <imode> anybody ever wrote their own promo doc.
[23:31:43] <indigo> imode: I have to write "accomplishment" docs about every quarter
[23:31:48] <manicennui> I never feel like I understand wtf grafana is showing me.
[23:31:50] <indigo> https://youtu.be/DYvhC_RdIwQ also, new Krazam
[23:31:51] <buttsbot> I Have Delivered Value... But At What Cost? - YouTube - https://youtu.be/DYvhC_RdIwQ
[23:32:09] <manicennui> Like it never seems to just be graphing numbers.
[23:34:28] <imode> indigo: I have to write the whole god damn doc.
[23:34:35] <imode> stuff that my manager would be writing.
[23:34:43] <imode> I'm not the only one either.
[23:34:44] <indigo> I think that's normal, no?
[23:35:18] <indigo> You write the doc, your manager proofs it, there are a couple iterations, and then it gets read by the promo committee
[23:35:50] <defect> sounds pretty much like what we do, though not every quarter
[23:35:57] <gwozniak> manicennui: I have a link to some internal grafana thing and I can never make decent sense of it
[23:36:13] <gwozniak> It's always different, too
[23:36:30] <manicennui> I click things that I don't understand, like "null as 0", and the entire graph changes.
[23:36:49] <manicennui> And I don't understand exactly what it is doing when I'm using upper 90 and then averaging it and grouping it, etc.
[23:37:02] <indigo> TBH if you want to get a promo, I'd just go back out in the job market
[23:37:11] <manicennui> I think I know what it should be doing, but the data often makes no sense.
[23:37:28] <manicennui> We do not write our own promo docs.
[23:37:49] <manicennui> The person's manager solicits feedback from people who have worked with the person, then puts together a promo request.
[23:39:27] <imode> indigo: putting it mildly, there are things in here that I just can't answer.
[23:39:40] <imode> not normal.
[23:39:41] <indigo> That's when you ask your manager for help, I guess
[23:39:44] <imode> haven.
[23:39:46] <imode> *have.
[23:39:53] <gwozniak> Dammit... I had a message all drafted for the customer and then I managed to figure out how to reproduce the problem.
[23:39:55] <imode> I'll probably just go fishing.
[23:40:03] <manicennui> I just told my manager that I didn't care whether I was promoted, and six months later I was promoted.
[23:40:45] <dminkovsky> imode: you fish?
[23:40:52] <gwozniak> I have, at best, a passing interest in wage increases and title stuff.  I keep getting them, for some reason
[23:41:22] <indigo> Same here; I think the culture around promos where I work is kinda toxic
[23:41:24] <imode> dminkovsky: in the job market lol.
[23:41:42] <dminkovsky> less exciting
[23:41:47] <imode> yeah.
[23:41:53] <imode> the most low-effort path present to me is triplebyte.
[23:41:57] <imode> I have to do nothing.
[23:42:02] <imode> and entertain offers.
[23:42:40] <dminkovsky> the offers entertain you
[23:42:51] <dminkovsky> and this isn't even soviet russia
