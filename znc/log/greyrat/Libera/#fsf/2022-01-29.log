[06:09:51] <nvuafo> does anyone have documentation or links of the NSA hiring moles to insert vulnerabilities into free software?
[06:10:52] <DiffieHellman> Nope, the NSA are good at hiding what they do.
[06:13:07] <nvuafo> OK. But are there documentions which you could infer the NSA does perform such operations?
[06:13:33] <nvuafo> the closest I've found is from this incident: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenBSD#Alleged_backdoor 
[06:13:40] <nvuafo> but it's the FBI.
[06:15:41] <DiffieHellman> They have most likely have written bugdoors.
[06:15:58] <DiffieHellman> systemd looks like an excellent place for them to me, same as Linux.
[06:16:28] <DiffieHellman> The solution is to really read every single line of free software that you get. I wonder if there's a program that lets you mark audited lines and compare git changes?

[06:19:16] <nvuafo> haha
[06:19:19] <jacobk> If groups tried to insert backdoors in free software projects often, surely we'd have found at least one good example by now, right?
[06:19:57] <DiffieHellman> Yes, one example was Linux, where someone cracked into the git host and inserted a bugdoor with a custom commit.

[06:32:47] <jacobk> It sounds like it never made it into an actual distribution though, but it somewhat surprises me that it was caught so quickly, given the way it appeared in the CVS repository.

[06:34:28] <DiffieHellman> The intention was probably to leave it there until some developer pulled from the CVS, made a patch and then there was hope that such patch would be merged via the proprietary bitkeeper.
[06:35:58] <jacobk> Wouldn't the developer see code they didn't write in their commit then?
[06:36:18] <jacobk> Or I guess they weren't using git, so I don't know if it shows diffs in the same way.
[06:36:27] <DiffieHellman> Typically, but say a commit that changed 2k lines or so?
[06:36:49] <jacobk> Oh yeah, but, the person adding the backdoor would have to get lucky.
[06:37:11] <jacobk> Because I would guess most commits are small.
[06:37:17] <jacobk> (But, maybe I'm wrong)
[06:37:25] <DiffieHellman> If you made some major changes to the same file, it might have slipped through.
[06:37:36] <DiffieHellman> Many commits are one liners, some are hundreds of lines.
[06:38:44] <jacobk> Yes, but I mean, the backdoorer would be banking on the first commit pushed to BitKeeper being a large commit, right?
[06:39:15] <DiffieHellman> Yup. I reckon it could lurk until someone actually added the matching file to a patchset

[12:59:30] <epony> the cheapest wireless card is AR9285
[12:59:39] <damo22> i have Qualcomm Atheros QCA9880 802.11nac
[12:59:40] <epony> AR9287 is even better
[13:00:39] <damo22> supposedly that one works with free firmware
[13:00:45] <epony> N-mode does not work well with all operating systems, especially the wider channels after G-mode, the 40 and 80 MHz bandwidth ones are.. largely misfortunate
[13:01:21] *** immibis_ is now known as immibis
[13:01:31] <DiffieHellman> It doesn't, the firmware is not free
[13:01:34] <epony> here is a list of one of the more prominent providers of free and open drivers:
[13:01:37] <epony> http://man.openbsd.org/athn.4#DESCRIPTION
[13:01:51] <DiffieHellman> Some other company got the firmware sources and made a few changes, but released such under the same proprietary licenses.
[13:02:07] <hiya> epony: for faster wifi?
[13:02:20] *** Joins: moto7 (~weechat@89-179-3-235.broadband.corbina.ru)
[13:02:33] <epony> why would you want faster if it's "half the time failing"
[13:02:57] <epony> and dropping back to 50 and 20 Mbps at the slightest interference
[13:03:44] <epony> the G mode gives you 20-25 Mbps, the N mode gives you 40-50 Mbps, that's quite alright (about 2.5 to 5 times faster than your nearest GOOG PoP)
[13:04:09] *** Joins: cb400f (~cb400f@85.24.34.93.generic-hostname.arrownet.dk)
[13:04:14] <epony> you're capped to 10 Mbps at most ISP servers and points of presence (and CDNs) for free tiers / general audience
[13:04:43] <epony> the global international transit is still floating at about 50 Mbps for residential subscribers
[13:05:07] <damo22> yeah i am not able to get better than 19Mbps uplink
[13:05:16] <epony> you can't get reliable wireless networking if you have more than 2 devices in direct vicinity
[13:05:43] <damo22> even on wired internet
[13:05:49] <epony> and 95% of all wireless chips produce delayes every 5-10 seconds for 1-2 seconds that drop out highly interactive traffic
[13:05:57] *** Quits: moto7_ (~weechat@188.66.35.101) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[13:06:21] <epony> so your best choice is an Ethernet cable, it's cheap and runs nominally at 100 and 1000 Mbps with 1-2 ms delay ONLY
[13:06:31] <damo22> lol
[13:06:44] <epony> while wireless gets you in the 5-10 ms range
[13:07:00] <DiffieHellman> That's some upstream provider...
[13:07:29] <epony> well, I'm 5ms to GOOG and other CDNs
[13:07:44] <damo22> if you want 500/500 symmetric youre looking at AUD$500/month 
[13:07:58] <damo22> plus the cost of the fibre installation
[13:08:08] <DiffieHellman> Yes, there's a lot of scammers.
[13:08:13] <epony> and 50 Mbps is just fine for HD TV streaming (it takes 2-3 Mbps for SD and 4-6 Mbps for HD)
[13:08:31] <DiffieHellman> Aussie broadband apparrently provdes 100Mb/40Mb.
[13:08:41] <epony> that's just super
[13:08:50] <damo22> yes i am with them, but my connection cant go faster than 50/20
[13:08:57] <damo22> its a limitation in my area
[13:08:59] <epony> if it's sustained internationally, not just national peering
[13:09:20] <DiffieHellman> Make a meshnet that covers the country?
[13:09:26] <epony> the real BW nominally is about 50 D / 25 U for most residential points
[13:09:31] <DiffieHellman> 3>Looks at 802.11ah max speeds
[13:09:53] <epony> 50/20 is alright
[13:10:06] <epony> it should cost about 10-20 EUR/USD world wide
[13:10:12] <epony> (monthly)
[13:10:23] <damo22> 50/20 is AUD$80
[13:10:33] <epony> you're a rich country
[13:10:56] <hiya> I get 200/200 13 USD/month
[13:11:00] <damo22> its okay, but im getting 50kB/s downloading from my VPS hosted in europe
[13:11:10] <DiffieHellman> 3>Upload: 15 Mbit/s Huh
[13:11:10] <hiya> There is a cap of 3TB I guess
[13:11:23] <epony> right, we're talking uncapped landlines
[13:11:47] <DiffieHellman> I can exceed 20 Mbit/s for a short while, but the upstream router throttling kicks in soon.
[13:12:07] <epony> ADSL / GPON typically in developed nations, COAX in rural areas
[13:12:40] *** Joins: vitali64 (~vitali64a@xdsl-31-164-198-163.adslplus.ch)
[13:13:31] <damo22> the biggest telco owns the wires in the ground, and charges a fortune to all the ISPs to use it
[13:13:37] <damo22> its a joke
[13:14:16] <DiffieHellman> Of course, they spent years doing fibre to the node only and then eventually realised they had to do full fibre.
[13:14:31] <DiffieHellman> All for saving money - that lead to a 2x increase in cost.
[13:14:34] <epony> so, if your internal network (LAN) is about ~10x faster (100-1000 Mbps) than your outer (WAN) connectivity (10-100 Mbps), you're well into the future compared to the international transit rates per residential client
[13:15:29] <epony> and thus even a G-mode wireless card is.. fine
[13:16:16] <damo22> yes i get by with 2.4GHz G-mode at home, its not much different to my WAN speed
[13:17:01] <damo22> but i sometimes turn off the radio
[13:17:10] <DiffieHellman> Yep, 802.11n still exceeds the speeds as long as you don't have much inteference.
[13:17:18] <epony> yes, the need for speed is an artificial / superficial extra cost for little gains, that don't propagate between endpoints on the global Internet
[13:18:39] <damo22> but i still should be able to download from another host of my choice faster than 50kB/s
[13:18:56] <DiffieHellman> Your ISP can't into routing huh?
[13:19:19] <epony> that's just.. peering and transit problems and/or overlay networks or server side throttling
[13:19:25] <DiffieHellman> A workaround is to hope that your ISP peers with hurricane electric and get yourself a gratis 6in4 tunnel from them.
[13:19:41] <vitali64> good morning fsf
[13:19:47] <damo22> im moving my VPS closer to my location
[13:19:55] <damo22> so i can actually use it
[13:20:12] <DiffieHellman> That way, IPv6 packets will be routed sanely until they reach hurricane electric, and then you get decent routing.
[13:20:44] <DiffieHellman> I just have a server on my LAN - get a nice gigabit connection.
[13:21:03] <damo22> gigabit?? im not paying $800/month
[13:21:33] <DiffieHellman> My LAN is 1000BASE-T, so the connection between the devices on the LAN goes at that speed.
[13:21:37] <damo22> oh
[13:21:55] <damo22> yeah that works, but i want to share files i create with my friends
[13:22:04] <damo22> and my uplink is only 19Mbps
[13:22:25] <DiffieHellman> I do just fine with 20Mbit uplink.

[15:52:39] <pert> now, one little-known problem with tcc is that it doesn't support the static array function parameter qualifier, i.e. the program 'int main(int argc, char *argv[static argc+1]) {};' fails to compile, but this is a relatively little-known C99 feature anyway

[15:58:00] <pert> I couldn't find a bug for it, but I wonder why GCC doesn't support automatic allocation of flexible array members (with a constant initializer or otherwise) as an extension. fortunately GCC supports variable-length arrays in unions (also an extension), so with type punning one can achieve the same result. I don't know that anyone would care if I file a bug, I'm sure they have plenty on their plates

[20:08:05] <pert> _chroot: my advice is more general than the specific ThinkPad model. if there are specific components you'd like me to comment on, let me know. in general, ThinkPads have good GNU/Linux support; there are folks at Lenovo that specifically work on this and, for example, cooperate with Debian Developers to package appropriate software
[20:08:43] <pert> they are suscepitble to the same problems that affect other laptops when using them with free software. the Wi-Fi may require non-free firmware (which can be solved by changing the card or getting a USB adapter)

[20:11:38] <pert> _chroot: yes, the Wi-Fi will probably not work and you will probably need to replace that, but Parabola is generally very up-to-date and you shouldn't otherwise have trouble. if you give me a moment, I can research the particular model more specifically
[20:12:55] <_chroot> Replace with some external usb wi-fi?
[20:14:51] <pert> yes, you could do that. the FSF certifies adapters that Respect Your Freedom (RYF) and are guaranteed to work well with free software. disclaimer: they've sponsored me in the past for work I've done related to these Wi-Fi adapters, but this one will work swimmingly https://www.thinkpenguin.com/gnu-linux/penguin-wireless-n-usb-adapter-gnu-linux-tpe-n150usb
