[03:27:03] <pdxjohnny> I have wondered this for many years and my google fo has failed me, thought I'd ask here. Is there a system call (or why does one not exist) that takes two file descriptors and associates them in a way such that for fd X, instead of queuing data for read() by a userspace process, data is effectively written to fd Y. As an example, say a userspace process has both a TCP and a UNIX socket open. Should
[03:27:05] <pdxjohnny> that userspace process wish to forward all data read from the TCP socket to the UNIX socket, it would have to do read(TCP) and then write(UNIX). With this hypotehical system call, it would do hyptohetical_forward(TCP, UNIX), and then not have to interact with the kernel to do the read()s and write()s.

I'm sure there is a reason...

[03:45:27] <lacroix> pdxjohnny: its not so common, and not really a OS interface (you dont get padd data to and process in and out when you just want forwarding)
[03:45:52] <lacroix> (the linux kernel network/firewalling can do that with more or less tricks)

[03:47:28] <sail0r> heap: sorry for the late repsonse. you can use parted or fdisk or gparted or somethign to find out where the beginning of the first sector is, subtract one and that's the end of you bootblock. i'm not 100% sure about this, so double/triple check before you do anything.
[03:47:43] <lacroix> pdxjohnny: posix itself doesnt make a distinction about syscall or not. its objective is to provide some interface which user processes interact with the operating system

[03:58:50] <lacroix> i am wondering if a future posix glibc aio could be implemented on top of io_uring
[03:59:06] <heap> is that correct how to flash image  dd if=imgfile bs=1M | pv | dd of=/dev/sdx ;
[04:00:14] <lacroix> you need do differentiate between some kernel thing and front-facing glibc  and then POSIX which just defined the api.
[04:01:21] <stealth_> i remember there being a patch to somehow making aio work with io_uring, but i am not sure if the author actual went ahead with it.
[04:01:24] <lacroix> stealth_: How are you dealing with the Python suckage relating to multi-threading?  Seems like aio wouldn't buy you squat given that Python serializes all system calls through a single global lock?
[04:01:47] <heap> does it mean if dd if image of card does nothing the card is broken?

[04:05:09] <stealth_> lacroix, i am not using aio, only io_uring. all the IO is handled by io_uring at kernel space in async, if it needs a thread for special case it will auto open it. As for multi-threading/GIL you just need go abut it differently.

[09:05:03] <rascul> better to track the pid and kill that instead of using killall, there care cases where it can match things you don't expect
[09:05:11] <mattf> rofi
[09:05:15] <mattf> what else could it be
[09:05:32] <mattf> how can i keep track of the pid across 2 different calls ?
[09:05:32] <rascul> anything that calls itself rofi, which isn't limited to rofi
[09:05:35] <mattf> save to a file?
[09:05:39] <mattf> it will be even slower
[09:06:00] <pnbeast> rascul, do you call yourself rofi?  Tell the truth.
[09:06:00] <mattf> now if rofi could update its own running instance that would be the thing
[09:06:03] <rascul> process management without being the process' parent is actually hard, but pid files are mostly a suitable solution, and it's not very slow
[09:06:16] <rascul> or at least it's not going to be noticably slow in general
[09:06:44] <Kyv> rascul: the solution to the "alsaosd" is to set the volume intervals higher

[14:06:28] <arthur-_> hey. I'm trying to remotely add a user to the sudoers file, this is for a script, to save having to do visudo 50 times a day. I'm trying to do ssh -t 'user@192.168.1.38' "sudo echo 'test ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL' >> /etc/sudoers" but that's not working. Any idea of a better method?
[14:07:06] *** Joins: lyndog (~lyndon@139.59.180.28)
[14:13:05] <akik> arthur-_: add it to /etc/sudoers.d/test

[14:13:21] <RayTracer> arthur-_: echo "blah" | sudo tee -a /file
[14:13:24] <treegazer> instead of adding via sudo, why not just put them in the wheel (or sudoers) group. Much easier.
[14:13:30] <arthur-_> thanks !!
[14:13:33] <arthur-_> I'll try all that
[14:14:09] <arthur-_> treegazer: will that allow them to run sudo commands without a password?
[14:14:15] <treegazer> (and also much easier to take out of the wheel (or sudoer) group if needed instead of faffing around with remote visuso
[14:15:03] *** Joins: ixil (~ixil@77.109.146.91)
[14:15:54] <treegazer> artuur: suggest you test it out for your own understanding. IMHO, it is essential to avoid having no password on sudo. far too easy for attackers to take advantage of any trust relationships you establish when there is no password.
[14:15:55] <arthur-_> because the default "group" setting doesn't have NOSSPASSWD
[14:15:56] <arthur-_> # Allow members of group sudo to execute any command
[14:15:56] <arthur-_> %sudo   ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL
[14:16:41] <arthur-_> treegazer: this is just automatically running a test of an installation in a local virtual machine that is deleted right afterwards, there is no security concern
[14:18:14] <arthur-_> I dismissed the idea of adding the user to the sudo group, because my undertsanding is that would still require a password (which the ansible stuff I'm working with and can't modify, expects a passwordless environment)

[15:06:11] <lacroix> emilsp, hi
[15:08:00] <lacroix> It can be done, artificially one can create it.
[15:09:02] *** Joins: ledeni (~ledeni@fedora/ledeni)
[15:09:08] <lacroix> as an example.. there is a rule that says 'to $destination lookup table 4', and the new route came into table 0 Or invalid next-hop, where the next-hop is on an interface that is down.
[15:09:34] <lacroix> can you give more context? Do you see this happening? and 'ip route' does indeed show the new route?
[15:11:39] <schillingklaus> i stick to ifconfig and route instead of the ip stuff
[15:11:55] *** Quits: niflce (uid503076@user/niflce) ()
[15:11:55] <emilsp> lacroix: The issue is that the route _should_ be valid.
[15:12:21] *** Guest1728 is now known as niflce
[15:12:26] *** Joins: maknho____ (~maknho@user/maknho)
[15:12:32] <emilsp> lacroix: basically, we have a bit of code that tries to detect whether there's internet connectivity as far as the routing table goes (we don't need to know if the packets will reach the internet, only if the packets will leave an interface)
[15:12:59] <emilsp> what we do is listen for changes to the routing table over netlink, and issue a query every time a message is received.
[15:12:59] <lacroix> And the next-hop is reachable?
[15:13:07] <emilsp> Pretty much
[15:13:30] <emilsp> the query is just ip route get $internet_ip mark $our_mark
[15:14:41] *** Joins: gry (~quassel@botters/gry)
[15:15:01] <emilsp> the issue is that some users report that sometimes they get stuck in the _offline state_ of our application. I gave them a debug build that did a lot more logging, and that doesn't fail. The only thing I can imagine being the culprit is that there's an amount of time where ip route get $address will not return a valid route after we've received an update about routes
[15:15:30] *** Quits: maknho___ (~maknho@user/maknho) (Ping timeout: 250 seconds)
[15:15:38] <lacroix> Did you look for trickery in 'ip rule', or possible even in netfilter?
[15:16:05] <emilsp> we have trickery in `ip rule`, but we're well aware of that, and it shouldn't be related :)
[15:16:12] <emilsp> what irks me is the timing of it
[15:16:37] <lacroix> So, You get the announcement, but the route is no installed in the kernel yet. That could be possible

[15:19:23] <hackinghorn> is it like flag=1
[15:19:32] <lacroix> emilsp, I'd have to check the sources to see what happens where, but I could imagine that you are picking up the message 'go install route 0.0.0.0/0 via $x'
[15:19:39] <hackinghorn> and put it in a conditionals: if [ flag ];
[15:19:40] <lacroix> is this correct?
[15:20:03] <lacroix> If you query immediately after thet, it might not have been installed yet.

[15:53:43] <jim> hackinghorn, if you really want to use echo, you could use "command substitution" in one of those shells, which looks like: $(someCmd a1 a2 a3), and what it does, is takes whatever someCmd -prints-, and puts that into an argument...

[19:08:27] <wyre> initrd, sorry, hehe
[19:09:03] <BCMM> they are filesystems that are available as soon as the kernel boots. they exist in RAM, and they are loaded in to RAM by the bootloader before it starts the kernel, so the kernel doesn't need to know anything about block devices and stuff
[19:09:27] <BCMM> (or they can be built in to the kernel image itself, so that the bootloader just loads them in to memory as a single unit)
[19:10:33] <BCMM> so if you want to be able to run code before the "real" root filesystem is mounted, you do it in the initramfs

[20:13:48] <plujon> 1. I'm about to get a 4 GB HDD, and I fear that when it gets full du -cks * | sort -n # will take forever

[20:14:27] <plujon> Oops, TB.
[20:14:37] <plujon> Also, I just arrived from 1996.
[20:14:46] <plujon> Are there any file systems that support [very?] fast du?  Or, should I use something fancier than du?

[20:15:36] <BCMM> or are you going to fill it with photos and videos and music like everybody else does?
[20:15:44] <plujon> Maybe; it'll mostly be rsnapshot and some big files.
[20:16:03] <BCMM> i'm asking because du runtime should scale with the number of files and directories, rather than with the total space occupied
[20:16:04] <jaafarrc> plujon: That command looks like "ducks".
[20:16:21] *** Parts: msiism (~msi@user/msiism) (Konversation vaporized.)
[20:16:49] <BCMM> also, if you want to analyse a whole drive to see where your disk space went, i'd use ncdu
[20:17:02] <Psi-Jack> Mmm, ncdu is definitely nice.
[20:17:17] <plujon> 2. As for #linux on freenode.net, I'm curious about the: "Cannot join channel (+i)..."; who caused that to happen?
[20:17:32] <plujon> BCMM: Thanks; I'll make a note of ncdu.
[20:17:56] <Psi-Jack> plujon, The ops. +i, because now the channel you join on failure is ##moved_to_libera.
[20:18:06] <plujon> Running `du -cks * | sort -n` on my 1 TB dist takes a long time, and it makes it harder for me to know what is using the storage.
[20:18:23] <Psi-Jack> Because, Freenode has failed us all, with sudden and unwanted changes.
[20:19:37] <BCMM> what used to happen on Real Freenode if you joined #linux? automatic redirect to ##linux, right?
[20:19:50] <plujon> Yeah, I think so.
[20:20:17] <jelly> plujon, two things: don't use -s.  Save the output to a files.

[20:21:08] <jelly> plujon, also, don't use * either, use . if you want the current directory and everything underneath
[20:21:19] <plujon> So, there's no file system that natively supports fast du (by keeping track of directory sizes [perhaps fundamentally a bad idea])

[23:57:16] <arthur-_> anyone knows how to keep a session open across ssh commands? like when I do https://pastebin.com/aMGUryc5 I'd like it to say /tmp/ at the end. I tried ControlMaster auto after that was advised to me, but it doesn't seem to keep the session open, I still end up with it not saying /tmp/ (maybe it keeps the *connection* but not the actual shell session ??). something like re-attaching to a screen for each ssh command would work here,
[23:57:16] <arthur-_> except I don't think screen itself would work, anyone knows of a command that would work for this, that looks like screen, but maybe simpler?
[23:57:39] <Psi-Jack> arthur-_, tmux.
[23:57:47] <Psi-Jack> Or screen, but I prefer tmux.

[23:58:58] <arthur-_> mutante: cd/pwd is just the basic example, I need to do much more complex stuff where I need to read the output, make decisions etc
[23:59:13] <arthur-_> I need to keep my state across ssh commands
[23:59:23] <mutante> arthur-_: you can write a bash script on the server and run that via ssh

[23:59:38] <Psi-Jack> Hmmmm.
[23:59:46] <mutante> ssh -C /usr/local/bin/mystuff.sh  ?
[23:59:47] <arthur-_> mutante: if it was that simple I wouldn't be asking the question
