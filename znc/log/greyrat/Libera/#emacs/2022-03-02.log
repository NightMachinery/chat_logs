[01:51:29] <lemacs_zzz> hi, is there a way to have a indicator of git changes on a file that is visible anywhere in the buffer? git gutter/diff-hl shows me changes in visible portion of the buffer, but I wanted some indication that there are changes, or maybe a indicator where these changes are. not sure if it's clear enough
[01:51:49] <lemacs_zzz> on vscode I could have an idea where the changes were by the minimap, since there was a gitgutter in the minimap
[01:52:13] <lemacs_zzz> so I'm looking for an alternative on emacs. any suggestions?

[02:01:59] <shrysr> lemacs_zzz:  maybe https://github.com/dengste/minimap ? I haven’t tried it, the readme says it shows a smaller version of the buffer and I was thinking it might include the git gutter.

[10:49:16] <ecraven> hyiltiz: no, because – as I told you above – `interactive' takes many parameters
[10:49:34] <ecraven> feel free to write and use such a macro, if you like it, but there's a reason it doesn't exist
[10:49:40] <hyiltiz> but 99% of the elisp I have seen so far is just (interactive) without any options
[10:49:48] <ecraven> then you haven't seen much :P
[10:50:01] * hyiltiz  most certainly have NOT seen much
[10:50:15] <edgar-rft> hyiltiz: then you have only seen very simple elisp :-)
[10:50:33] <hyiltiz> ok i'll not whine around so what do I change for my "macro" to work?
[10:51:09] <hyiltiz> so I can write things like (fn (settext-scale-reset 1)) and that will return an interactive macro?
[10:51:15] <edgar-rft> hyiltiz: interactive often is used to ask for additional input, where the number of possible use-cases is endless
[10:51:38] <hyiltiz> s/interactive lambda/
[10:52:40] <hyiltiz> yeah reading (interactive) now but again, most of my init.el functions have just (interactive) and I guess I probably will need it without options mostly

[10:59:40] <bpalmer> I had something for a while like (defmacro wrap (&rest body) `(lambda ,(or (assoc 'interactive body) '(interactive)) ,@(loop for b in body unless (and (listp b) (eq (car b) 'interactive)) collect b)))  but it really wasn't worth the complexity
[10:59:58] <bpalmer> lambda and interactive are really not a big deal.
[11:00:26] <bpalmer> Although, really, I don't encourage the use of lambda.
[11:00:41] <edgar-rft> hyiltiz *asked* for shit, so it happened :-)
[11:01:22] <hyiltiz> thx for indulging me; I see how it can easily spin out of hand when a noob wants to abuse it...
[11:01:31] * hyiltiz self identifies as a noob
[11:02:02] <hyiltiz> This doesn't seem to work; am I doing something wrong as well? (defmacro fn (&rest body) `(lambda () (interactive) ,@body)) (bind-key* "C-=" '(fn (text-scale-set 0)))

[11:02:25] <bpalmer> you wouldn't quote the fn bit, because you want it evaluated.

[11:02:44] <hyiltiz> hmm no wonder it is not recommended

[11:03:34] *** Joins: aleck (~aleck@user/aleck)
[11:03:50] <hyiltiz> can that fn macro be eager so it gets evaluated BEFOREhand i.e. returns a true lambda so I can still use ' like most of my other key maps? (I might be asking too much onw)
[11:04:21] <bpalmer> (Incidentally, my wrap thing above was from memory and it doesn't work properly for non-trivial interactives; the real macro would have done something like if interactive has a single argument, count newlines; if not, count length of list, and provide numbered parameters.
[11:04:28] <bpalmer> Anaphoric macros are *also* something I've moved away from.
[11:04:42] <bpalmer> Maybe it's worth re-writing this, though ... hmm.
[11:05:36] * hyiltiz is feeling this is becoming like a academic code golf; the defun was clean, had docstring, and easy to understand and maintain
[11:06:39] <edgar-rft> true, macros *sometimes* simplify things, but often make things much more confusing than necessary

[23:46:11] <corwin> twb: I'm with you on this, FWIW.  I think of it rather like a federal death penalty in the US: whom do I really trust to be making such decisions?

[23:53:30] <_73> I want to use `C-m` as a prefix key so I ran `(global-set-key (kbd "C-m") nil)`. For some reason though after I do this `RET` no longer inserts a newline. It seems that RET was also set to nil? Strange. Looking at the code for `newline` I see nothing that mentions C-m.
[23:53:39] <Sario> Noob, slightly off topic question: is there a way in Org to make a scheduled item reoccur on Nth <weekday> of a month?
[23:54:44] <e1f> RET is C-m just like TAB is C-i
[23:54:45] <rpav> _73: C-m is RET even in X apparently, unfortunately
[23:54:50] <aidalgol> What exactly is SAML?  In idiot's terms.
[23:55:01] <corwin> Sario: have you looked at this already? https://orgmode.org/manual/Repeated-tasks.html
[23:55:15] <e1f> and Esc is C-]
[23:55:33] <rpav> mine doesn't seem to be
[23:55:35] <Sario> corwin: thanks, I was having issues trying to find the right docs
[23:55:43] <corwin> Sario: I'm guessing "yes but how do I constrain to weekdays", in which case IDK if there is anything built it or not.
[23:55:51] <_73> rpav: Ohh ok. That cost me a very confusing debugging session :)
[23:56:07] <rpav> maybe C-m and RET / C-i and TAB can be similarly disconnected

[23:57:27] <rpav> think of having two new, entirely unused prefix keys!
[23:57:54] <rpav> oh, C-[ is ESC ;/
[23:58:19] <_73> I had big plans for my C-m prefix.
[23:59:01] <corwin> aidalgol: SAML is a way do "single sign-on" (SSO) authentication that has separate concepts for identity provider (list of accounts) and service provider (something I want to access) and allows building in "assertions" (e.g. group memberships, and so on).
[23:59:25] <rpav> hrm maybe you can
