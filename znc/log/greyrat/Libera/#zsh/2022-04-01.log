[03:25:15] <MrFantastik> Hello all, I'm trying to configure a remote machine with a script such that when i run a script, it creates a virtual environment with python 3.7.5 and it configures a bare oh-my-zsh install with virtualenv
[03:25:16] *** Joins: Techcable (~Techcable@user/Techcable)
[03:25:32] <phy1729> !omz
[03:25:32] <machabot> "omz" is shorthand for "oh-my-zsh", an extension which the consensus of this channel recommends against using.  If you see odd behaviour using omz, please try disabling omz and see if the issue remains. For assistance with oh-my-zsh, try the discord https://discord.gg/ohmyzsh or https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/discussions
[03:25:49] <MrFantastik> ah okay ty
[03:26:04] <MrFantastik> yea unfortunatley my hands are tied on using omz
[03:26:10] <phy1729> Why?
[03:26:45] <MrFantastik> we use it as the default shell config in a product we offer
[03:27:20] <MrFantastik> and I want to get off of it but the stakeholder is really adamant that we use it citing users like it
[03:27:42] <phy1729> Perhaps you can see what features they like and keep just those.
[03:28:09] <MrFantastik> yea i had that discussion this morning
[03:28:39] <phy1729> If it's syntax highlighting, that's a separate project
[03:28:46] <MrFantastik> the main thing is that he notices a lot of our users having it as there default shell in iterm
[03:29:04] <MrFantastik> and our product is cloud dev envs (sort of)
[03:29:19] <MrFantastik> so we want to be as close to our user's terms as possible
[03:29:31] <MrFantastik> i believe there is sampling bias here though
[03:29:43] <phy1729> That would argue against using omz since that isn't shipped with macos
[03:29:51] <MrFantastik> to me, users want a reliable, reproducable, easy to configure dev env
[03:30:29] <MrFantastik> the rebuttal to that was they had fancy prompts and its likely they used omz to achieve that
[03:30:30] <Mikachu> does the version you install auto-update itself from the omz github?
[03:30:45] <MrFantastik> I'm not sure
[03:31:13] <MrFantastik> I can check, pretty sure its default way to install on ubuntu is how we get it on the workspace
[03:32:20] <MrFantastik> part of me wonders if the solution to this is push back harder again but I want to make and honest effort to get this to work and I'm pretty close
[03:32:44] <MrFantastik> I'm having issues with loading virtualenvwrapper into the startup shell thats configuring the workspace
[03:32:54] <Mikachu> sounds like fun
[03:33:15] <MrFantastik> my desk has an imprint of my face on it but otherwise yea lol

[03:48:56] <phy1729> !omzwhy
[03:48:56] <machabot> It is a collection of subpar quality shell scripts that abstracts the configuration of zsh in ways unknown to us (seemingly its users too) and reinvents various features of zsh. All in a effort of providing the mystical "sane default config".

[08:10:54] <viva> hi everyone, i am using zsh as my daily driver and i want to add some aliases, when i first test drove this like a year ago i read on a zsh primer website about adding aliases permanently to the shell using a cmd in the shell it was something like 'alias ll=ls -al'  i cannot for the life of me find
[08:11:05] <viva> info on how to do it "this way" now, does this ring any bells for anyone?
[08:11:16] <viva> im a little scared to go creating/editing zshrc files or w/e they're called
[08:11:49] <llua> that is indeed the command, one usually puts it in .zshrc
[08:12:04] <llua> you may want to quote the rhs of the = tho
[08:13:14] <viva> does that export it permanently?
[08:13:28] <viva> i couldnt seem to get it working perhaps i wasnt doing something right. ill chek again
[08:13:31] <larryv> no. you're going to have to edit a dotfile whether you like it or not
[08:13:46] <viva> ok
[08:14:10] <viva> also, can you tell me how to get my macos zsh PS1 to be a two row PS1 like the way it is by default in kali?
[08:14:32] <phy1729> typeset -p PS1 on kali and copy that into your macos .zshrc
[08:14:38] <viva> ok

[16:25:58] <malina> hi. is it possible to do a xtrace without parameters being substituted or so?
[16:26:51] <malina> I'd like to basically get a script printed with something like echo "+ ls `#comm \`\
[16:26:51] <malina> ls\`\ 
[16:26:51] <malina> `-al"
[16:27:27] <malina> like ls -al but arr=(1 2 3); echo "$arr[@]"  still printed verbatim
[16:27:47] <malina> and not echo 1 2 3
[16:29:52] <malina> it boils down to being able to prune the hacky zsh -c ' arr=(1 2 `#ignore` 3); echo $arr' kinda comments out of source
[16:31:37] <llua> doctor it hurts when doing the hack
[16:31:47] <malina> I know, right :D
[16:33:10] <llua> i seriesly doubt it since `` is actual code that is being eval'd. maybe use actual comments?
[16:33:20] <llua> seriously*

[16:34:19] <malina> configure --apes --write --novels `#--hangover` --so-on happens. 
[16:35:09] <malina> as it stands, I have to either use an external tool to first look for those in source files and remove, then let the shell do its thing OR ideally, use some xtrace/other internals to prune that or something
[16:35:09] <llua> sudo rm -rf $var_that_expands_to_/ happens too
[16:35:22] <malina> ye
[16:35:28] <malina> good catch
[16:35:48] <malina> in fact, goddman don't write that , I am tired and almost copied and pasted to see what you wre on about
[16:36:03] <malina> (kinda joking but ye, )
[16:36:04] <malina> :D
[16:38:09] <malina> erm still, where did you have in mind using 
[16:38:40] <llua> !paradigm
[16:38:40] <machabot> Some people, when confronted with a problem they "just have to" solve with shell, think: "I know, Ill apply the typical paradigms of language `X, which Im so fond of, to shell to solve the problem!" Now they have a broken solution and several questions only answerable by !paradigm
[16:39:01] <llua> not trying to bend a lang into another lang with inline comments
[16:39:14] <malina> no I know, but the fact remains
[16:40:11] <llua> that is what i would do. if it annoys you enough to care, i would attempt to patch the shitty code
[16:40:26] <llua> zsh isn't the problem here
[16:40:28] <malina> ye, the patching is what is intended. (but
[16:40:31] <malina> no , I know it isn't
[16:40:52] <malina> I just was wondering if there is something like zsh -x --literal legal.zsh
[16:41:04] <malina> you know, something a dim brick like me wouldn't know or imagine :p

[20:14:27] <phy1729> ahhh right
[20:14:34] <leah2> phy1729: so you need to build it twice or copy stuff around

[20:15:46] <phy1729> Could maybe have a noarch foo-completions package but I don't think that's very void'y
[20:16:17] <leah2> well my idea was a 'compdef _complete_from_output foobar' or something...
[20:16:37] <leah2> phy1729: you would need to update it all the time etc
[20:17:10] <leah2> i didnt check the quality of these scripts yet :p may not be worth it

[20:18:20] <phy1729> I think the best we can hope for is a way to generate the completion script at install time from the argparse lib. I've got a mostly there PoC for click https://github.com/phy1729/click_completion_zsh

[20:19:25] <leah2> llua: and now add caching :p
[20:20:00] <phy1729> I still think it should be solved at package time. How do you handle crossarch testing?
[20:20:08] <leah2> we dont :p
[20:20:16] <phy1729> I see
[20:20:25] <leah2> we have some qemu-user support but i dont really want to increase it

[20:22:45] <phy1729> I guess could ask upstreams to run it for you and stick it in the tarball, but I suspect many of these projects just tag a commit and call it good and let gh make the tarball.
[20:23:01] <leah2> right
[20:23:20] <leah2> being a distro maintainer is a fight against windmills :p
[20:23:46] <phy1729> You underestimate my willingness to fight long slow uphill battles
[20:24:09] <leah2> the amount of new software is so high
[20:24:30] <phy1729> but you don't have to fix most of it; you can target the argparse lib
[20:24:44] <leah2> well i was thinking of go like llua
[20:24:52] <leah2> i dont use too much python stuff :p
[20:25:09] <phy1729> Surely most people use conda or whatever it's called
[20:26:08] <phy1729> cobra?
[20:26:21] <leah2> conda is a binary thing for python
[20:26:35] <leah2> also made in hell :p
[20:26:54] <llua> the starting point of all of this is hell
[20:27:14] <leah2> the starting point is that debian is too slow to update anything :p
[20:27:28] *** Joins: av6 (~av6@kdm.dwimlabs.net)
[20:27:51] <phy1729> why is that the starting point?
[20:28:38] <leah2> because people started to work around how to install software that doesnt come from the distro
[20:29:21] <leah2> idk what the first language was that used its own package manager
[20:29:36] <leah2> i guess technically perl but i can't remember installing from cpan yourself was a big thing
[20:29:46] <phy1729> I think that was devs not wanting to learn a dozen distributions' way to package things
[20:30:48] <leah2> not sure what's cause and effect here

[20:33:05] <phy1729> In any case people want shell completion but there's too many projects to hand write them all. I think the next best thing is to teach the various libraries how to spit out a proper zsh completion script and not a "call me again when the user hits tab" one

[20:53:42] <phy1729> There's 4 spots I see the completer can be generated, tarball, make, shell startup, tab hit. The last two require user intervention and requires far more people to do a thing than the first two. Of those two many projects don't roll their own tarball so that stage isn't an option (and while most packagers don't like github tarballs, I don't want to complect that issue with this one). That leaves make
[20:53:43] <phy1729> time; that breaks cross builds, but that's the fewest pieces to fix option.

[20:56:58] <llua> zsh already have _arguments --/_gnu_generic which is the third option. but i do like option 1 or 2
[20:58:48] <phy1729> Sure could have _cli_generic in tree and a very long compdef line as another option. That doesn't require user intervention, but does mean we should release more often.
[20:59:06] <llua> not wanting to further endores option 3 is why _cli_generic is out of tree
