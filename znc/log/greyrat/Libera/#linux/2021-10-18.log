[01:35:12] <SnoopJ> so, one thing I'm wondering about this MADV_DONTDUMP experiment working in C++: I've only tested this with some memory allocated in the program itself. I wonder if the way I've been trying to exclude a file-backed mapping has something to do with my woes.

[01:37:08] <SnoopJ> The Python reproduction I came up with is doing what I really care about: trying to exclude a file-backed mapping. The C++ sanity-check is currently excluding something that lives in an anonymous mapping. Going to make the C++ example use file-backed for a true comparison, but maybe it's something nuanced in the difference between the two?

[01:40:54] <SnoopJ> talismanick, available for what? I've solved accessibility-behind-NAT problems (which I assume this is) with SSH reverse tunnels before
[01:41:15] <talismanick> I started up an ssh server on it, scan the local network with nmap, and ssh'd into it
[01:41:27] <akk> talismanick: Your router will have to allow outside machines to connect to it, and you might need something like dynamic DNS too.
[01:41:34] <SnoopJ> i.e. SSH from the place I wanna go (private network) to something publicly available on the internet (my VPS) and establish a reverse tunnel. It's useful for relatively low amounts of traffic.
[01:42:03] <rascul> talismanick if ipv6 then it might be as easy as checking a box in router config to allow outside connections to the local prefix or something like that, if it's ipv4 then you likely have to do port forwarding at the router
[01:42:04] <SnoopJ> I would probably do something else if I wanted "real" networking but I'm usually just using ssh itself over the tunnel :)

[05:22:48] <keir> *spock cries*
[05:23:08] <johnjay> i mean take the guile project for instance. you would think chapter 1 section 1 telling you how to do hello world would be easy to compile right
[05:23:18] <johnjay> when i asked in the #guile channel i was told on that's wrong you do it this way

[06:19:13] <pankaj> I am trying to understand 'block size' and 'sector size' on system by means of practical analysis. As far as I know I can modify block size. Just want to know what is the minimum size of a partition for ext4 filesystem? And can it support block size of 512 bytes or its support has been ended?

[06:23:48] <[[R]]> sheep: big fan of floppy things?
[06:23:49] <jim> pankaj, sector size sounds like a fixed hardware parameter per-drive, and block size would be a multiple of the hardware sector size, and it applies to specific filesystems
[06:23:51] <pankaj> sheep: So how much should be the minimum for ext4?
[06:24:11] <pankaj> jim: yeah, modifying the block size not the sector size.
[06:24:21] <[[R]]> pankaj: are you worried about the minimum size of an ext4 filesystem, or are you worried about the block size and sector size?
[06:24:31] <sheep> I'm not sure, but it probably depends on what options you choose for things like the number of inodes to have

[10:59:00] <n4dir> yeah, well, you know, to me compiling is just plain weird, rindolf . For MIDI-Visualizer i had to use cmake, it made no sense to me at all, i just used commands found on the web, and ... it worked. A miracle
[10:59:20] <just-me> I looked online but most of it boils down to disconnecting and reconnecting the device. I am looking for a more permanent solution.
[10:59:21] <n4dir> i do understand the configure-make-make-install routine, but thats about it.

Need to duplicate an EBS backed EC2 instance on AWS powering a live site, is creating an AMI image the way to go for this? If so, AWS documentation says that you can have an option called "No reboot" checked in order to avoid AWS powering down the EC2 instance from which you are generating the AMI, should I do this?

[16:12:57] <hexnewbie> You have two options, the rather simple and mainline overlayfs, which is stricter as it comes to the underlying filesystems (some chance it might refuse tmpfs), and the rather complex and looser aufs, which is complex as it requires you to maintain non-in-tree module by yourself

[16:17:31] <DPA> I want to put it there, but I have to create 2 directories after mounting the tmpfs, but before mounting the overlayfs, because the overlayfs needs them.

[16:17:58] <Khaytsus> DPA: Why wouldn't a bind mount work for a ro directory?  Seriously doubt that it matters.
[16:18:50] <jim> so put a noauto option on the line in fstab, and run a script that makes the dirs and runs "mount /thatmountpoint"
[16:18:55] *** d[-_-]b is now known as stenno
[16:19:14] <DPA> A bind mount just mounts a directory somewhere else, optionaly with ro set. It can not be used for anything where the contents of the original and the mounted directory would need to diverge.

[16:28:34] <hexnewbie> I couldn't get overlay root to work with NFS+XFS, but that was in 2014, and with aufs it was hobbled by issues when the underlying root filesystem changed. From stale handles, to odd things. Finally using a regular filesystem individual for the server was the sane thing to do, avoiding complications like that

[20:53:44] <Huckleberry> Hi there, question about Samba shares on Linux. I'm setting up a Raspberry Pi to host Sony PS2 games over SMB share. Currently, there exists a '/share' directory that was mounted with the proper permissions, as per a related Bash script from a GitHub project, aka these are the permissions: drwxrwxrwt
[20:53:54] <Huckleberry> Also the '/share' is highlighted in green in terminal with ls -al
[20:54:04] <wwwi_> hello
[20:54:06] <Huckleberry> how do I mount a drive on /dev/sda1 to that specific directory with the same permissions
[20:54:07] *** Quits: trekkie1701c (~trekkie17@user/trekkie1701c) (Quit: :P)
[20:54:18] <wwwi_> when logrotate rotates the log files?
[20:54:42] <Huckleberry> I ask because I need to setup '/etc/fstab' afterwards with the same permissions to autoshare the same drive*

[20:55:18] <djph> eewwwwww NTFS
[20:55:40] <djph> NTFS doesn't do linux permissions.  I forget the
[20:55:48] <Huckleberry> actually no

[22:51:42] <paulcarroty> TheGuestMovie Open VSX created by Eclipse Foundation (https://www.eclipse.org/), this is open market, anybody can contribute. About restriction - MS don't allow to use their store for 3rd-party, so that's the reason.
[22:51:56] <Guest7463> miko: this proves KDE is heavier than icewm; and for the facts, it can be considered a windows manager somewhat
[22:51:56] <TheGuestMovie> paulcarroty: yeah I read all that

[22:52:32] <TheGuestMovie> paulcarroty: what I was wondering is how they got those 1.5k extensions onto OpenVSX. Are most of those devs aware and uploading there? Or did random people take the (open-source) extension and upload it themselves?
[22:52:33] <Huckleberry> weird
[22:52:36] <TJ-> gschanuel: errrm, no. Keep back-ups of vital data, but if continuity is important make the LVs RAID1 mirrors so they are mirroed on both devices

[22:53:09] <TJ-> Huckleberry: that could be failed firmware in the USB device's controller
[22:53:14] <hexnewbie> In the good old days, you could run KDE 1 as the window manager for GNOME 1 (which didn't have one). And did what it sounds like - it started kwin, kdesktop *on top* of the GNOME desktop, and the kicker two panels alongside the GNOME panel

[23:15:50] <hexnewbie> Guest7463: Well, the ‘ &> /dev/null &’ part, yeah, but what is the subshell for?
[23:15:51] <Gustavo6046> velix: Generally you want nohup, and do what I said above, redirect stdout to null and stderr to stdout, I don't think you need a subshell for that
[23:16:07] <Gustavo6046> hexnewbie: No idea, I guess it's just a nuclear option?
[23:16:08] <hexnewbie> nohup will definitely do more good than a subshell
[23:16:56] *** heineken is now known as battousai
[23:17:13] <hexnewbie> So the answer is either nohup or ‘&>/dev/null’ but unclear which one. Maybe throw both at the problem just to be sure.
