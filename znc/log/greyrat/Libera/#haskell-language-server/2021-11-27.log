[00:47:12] <eddiemundo> is it possible that lsp-test is applying TextEdits in reverse order than my nvim client or vscode?
[00:48:05] <eddiemundo> i have a test that reverses the order of the text edits in a golden test but both nvim and vscode clients work insert the edits in reverse order
[00:49:00] <eddiemundo> s/i have a test that reverses the order of the text edits in a golden test but both nvim and vscode clients work insert the edits in reverse order/i have a test that reverses the order of the text edits in a golden test when compared to both nvim and vscode clients/
[00:50:13] <eddiemundo> but it seems weird for that to be the case since there's got to be another test somewhere that depends on text edit ordering
[00:53:20] <eddiemundo> it's essentially a delete, followed by 3 inserts, where order matters. if i reverse the order of text edits in code, then the test passes, but the clients become wrong...

[14:58:30] <fendor[m]> <maralorn> "Something really weird broke one..." <- yeah, nix messed up ðŸ˜›
[14:59:06] <fendor[m]> very strictly speaking, we are lacking an upper-bound on implicit-hie, which has now three broken releases in a row: https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server/issues/2398
[15:02:16] <maralorn> Aah, interesting.
[15:02:29] <fendor[m]> and nixpkgs picked that up
[15:02:55] <maralorn> So we should override to an older implicit-hie version? We should at least do that on nixos 21.11.
[15:03:20] <fendor[m]> yeah
[15:03:56] <fendor[m]> 3.* series should be fine
[15:13:11] <jneira[m]> hmm maybe it would be good to do pull requests in implicit-hie instead direct commits to master without any checking

[16:04:15] <jneira[m]> nix can reproduce failing builds with great reliability :-P 
[16:04:54] <jneira[m]> (not a bad thing, reproduce failing builds could be as usefult as a working one)
[16:06:50] <maerwald> I don't think it can... I remember nix builds failing on some GHC CI runners and succeeding on others
[16:07:42] <maerwald> environment always leaks into the build, even if it's "just" the kernel

[17:54:26] <jneira[m]> i am gonna try to reuse test results between workflow runs for the same commit, to only rerun failed tests and alliviate the terrible flakyness
[18:11:34] <fendor[m]> do we know why they are flaky? Maybe group a small task force to address flaky tests
[19:04:38] <jneira[m]> we have anissue about but i have to analyze the frequency of late runs
