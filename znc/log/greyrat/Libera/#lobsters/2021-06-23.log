[10:22:24] <manicennui> To differentiate it from ad optimization technology.
[10:22:59] <manicennui> I still don't understand what it is that all of this ML is accomplishing.
[10:23:06] <manicennui> All of the examples I see are pretty bad.
[10:23:26] <xerxes> manicennui: One hopes that the two schools would work together for hybrid solutions instead. I like the point Gary Markus makes. Machine learning would have some nifty tricks up it's sleeve but it's not the end of the world.
[10:23:31] <manicennui> Recommendation engines and ad selection seems to be worse now.
[10:23:34] <kirch> "computer vision was originally a summer project given to a grad student"
[10:24:12] <kirch> generative text is cool, but adtech is awful
[10:24:28] <manicennui> We are still decades away from "self driving" cars that can drive in anything but perfect conditions.
[10:25:12] <xerxes> manicennui: I would believe AGI is on the horizon when self-driving taxis can drive in countries like India while picking up customers.
[10:25:46] <manicennui> xerxes: They can't even drive in much of the US, especially if there is any "weather".
[10:26:16] <manicennui> And I'm sure you've seen the self-driving test video that made the rounds a couple months ago.
[10:26:35] <manicennui> And now Tesla is downplaying all of their claims with regulators.
[10:27:34] <manicennui> People have been claiming self driving cars are a couple years away for over a decade since Google revealed that they were using some self driving cars to take photos for Google Maps.
[10:27:42] <kirch> there's like 5 self-driving car companies here.... and their vehicles are annoying at best.... they have thousands of scans of a particular finger of mine
[10:28:09] <kirch> Tesla's "Autopilot" that has driven people into barriers
[10:29:02] <xerxes> manicennui: US cities are optimised for car driving. If a self-driving car can't perform there, there is not much chance for it to perform better anywhere. Cities in the Global South are optimised for area. It has narrow lanes and no "rules". Much of the traffic "rules" in countries like India is "human" communication and cooperation.
[10:29:03] <manicennui> Things like Siri and Alexa remain novelties.
[10:29:06] <kirch> couple years ago I snapped a pic of a Google Maps car with the front all smashed in sitting at a local garage, still makes me chuckle
[10:29:39] <manicennui> I just don't understand what all of this obsession with ML has gotten us.
[10:29:49] <manicennui> Some of it is cool I guess, but I wouldn't rely on any of it.
[10:29:53] <kirch> cool text generators and shitty adtech
[10:30:03] <kirch> the art stuff is best
[10:31:17] <xerxes> manicennui: Even human drivers from Stockholm or Berlin would need quite the training to drive in Manila, Mumbai or Dhaka.
[10:32:02] <manicennui> Sure. I think most of the push is to make it work in developed countries because the cost of labor is higher.
[10:32:28] <manicennui> I kind of feel like Uber was betting on it solving all of their labor problems.
[10:33:51] <xerxes> manicennui: When research is lead by multinational megacorps, it probably won't go in the direction which would increase the utility in the long term. If all you care in how to show better ads, machine learning might be a better solution.

[10:35:00] <xerxes> manicennui: I mean pharma companies spend a lot of money on solving rich people's trivial diseases while poor people's grave diseases continue to spread and kill in Africa, etc. Incentives.
[10:35:25] <manicennui> Sure.
[10:35:33] <manicennui> The ads shown to me still suck.
[10:35:47] <manicennui> None of the big networks seem to have learned basic things about me.
[10:36:08] <xerxes> manicennui: I think Grammarly has been hardcoded into the Google Ad-Sense engine, lol.
[10:36:50] <xerxes> manicennui: They don't get that unless there is a Grammarly plugin for Vim, I won't even consider it :)
[10:37:08] <manicennui> I have seen a lot of Grammarly ads, and I would never consider using it.
[10:37:26] <xerxes> manicennui: I'm sure Emacs would have some "M-x grammarly" mode by now or something like that :P
[10:38:05] <manicennui> Once in a great while Google's grammar advice in gmail or whatever is useful.
[10:38:11] <manicennui> But most of the time it is just confused.
[10:38:25] <xerxes> manicennui: Why do they keep showing me that? I'm pretty sure I won't use Grammarly or any other spell checker unless I'm forced to.
[10:38:41] <manicennui> No idea.
[10:39:00] <manicennui> I assume Grammarly paid for a lot of ads and continues to do so.
[10:39:25] <xerxes> manicennui: There was a documentary on AT&T on YouTube in which Brian Kernighan demonstrates some crude spell checker he made by piping UNIX tools.
[10:39:52] <manicennui> There are several popular command line spell checkers.
[10:40:08] <manicennui> You can certainly add aspell support to your IRC client/editor.
[10:40:46] <meff[m]> ML is pretty cool, exciting stuff
[10:40:56] <manicennui> meff[m]: For what?
[10:41:17] <meff[m]> oh, everything. Demand forecasting, anomaly detection, voting theory, etc
[10:42:28] <meff[m]> The flagship usecases of self-driving cars I don't know much about and am not really particularly interested in, though I have friends who work in self-driving cars. I barely drive and mostly bike around
[10:43:31] <xerxes> manicennui: I know there are. I meant that simple tools like those might give 90% of the performance of the hefty ML tools with very little costs.
[10:44:12] <xerxes> manicennui: Most companies using ML might just do almost all well with a couple of well-crafted SQL queries.
[10:44:41] <manicennui> I think ML advocates would argue that ML can come up with those queries.
[10:45:37] <manicennui> Our analytics department was super excited about ML, and we started using an ML produced model for part of our underwriting, but they stopped, and it hasn't been discussed much recently.
[10:45:44] <meff[m]> with occam's razor, wouldn't you think an ML engineer knows how to write SQL and can think of a solution that SQL can handle better than ML?
[10:46:12] <meff[m]> or is this an argument of aligned incentives?
[10:46:41] <meff[m]> (a la Sinclair, "It is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends on his not understanding it")
[10:47:05] <manicennui> I think the real argument is that some business analyst can write a query that is good enough and we don't have to spend six figures for someone to play with ML.
[10:48:25] <manicennui> The argument for ML probably becomes stronger at huge companies with huge problems where a tiny increase in efficiency saves them millions.

[10:59:00] <xerxes> manicennui: I feel that ML engineers sincerely believe neither they nor someone else could come up with SQL queries which deliver performance like the ML models. ML has enough smoke and mirrors to defy understanding. How can SQL do what we don't understand?
[10:59:38] <manicennui> We can have a business analyst spend some time trying to understand it.
[10:59:38] <xerxes> manicennui: I'm sorry that was in response to meff[m]'s question.
[11:00:11] <manicennui> I feel like there are a lot of people who believe that basically nothing can be understood and everything is luck and randomness.
[11:00:14] <manicennui> Which is nonsense.
[11:00:42] <manicennui> I see this a lot when it comes to engineers and dealing with human beings.
[11:01:37] <manicennui> In the business world there are also insane ideas that we can somehow please everywhere if we just model their behavior well enough.
[11:01:50] <riv> manicennui, is the universe actually understandable or do we just make it understandable or just focus on the parts that do make sense?
[11:02:17] <xerxes> manicennui: please?
[11:02:24] <manicennui> riv: It is extremely complex, beyond our understanding, but there are definitely parts of it that many people do understand.
[11:03:45] <manicennui> I think this is part of what drives geeks crazy about Apple: they have a vision and a target audience and don't generally test their way into solutions.
[11:03:52] <manicennui> So of course they don't appeal to everyone.

[11:04:40] <meff[m]> the fact that ML engineers sincerely believe that SQL cannot deliver ML model like performance
[11:04:59] <manicennui> Comparing the two seems odd.
[11:05:27] <meff[m]> in my anecdotal experience, most uses of "ML" are just linear or logistic regression, maybe XGBoost. The regression techniques have been part of Oracle DBs and Excel for ages
[11:05:37] <meff[m]> pretty sure BigQuery at this point supports regression out of the box also
[11:06:12] <manicennui> Analytics departments were certainly creating such models before ML.

[23:41:11] <daegalus> Teckla: not really. They might improve your gut health, which can improve other things, which indirectly might lead to improvement in weight loss, but its nothing direct. More of just one of many factors in weight. The number 1 thing for seeing teh number go down on the scale is caloric intake. Even if you dont count categories, eating reasonable portions, maximizing protein, and eliminating
[23:41:14] <daegalus> added sugars, usually does the most for weight loss. But everyone is different so different things work for different people, calories is just the only thing that is directly related to the number on the scale (this is information from multiple nutritionists and metabolic experts I have gone to for weight loss help. Lost 35 lbs in the last 3 months)

[23:43:40] <daegalus> You also need to eat a lot more protein than people think they need. I was quoted a minimum of 100g per day is my requirement just to supply my body with the necessary things to function. 130g ideally. Thats 40+ grams per meal. Thats 8 oz of chicken, or fish, tofu, etc per meal. or equivalent. You just need a lot per meal to hit those kind of numbers. I used to average 60-80. protein just makes
[23:43:43] <daegalus> you feel fuller, takes a long time to digest, so you eat less. Its also dense

[23:45:19] <ngoldbaum> less calories more exercise -> weight loss for most people
[23:45:43] <ngoldbaum> personally getting an apple watch really helped my motivation
