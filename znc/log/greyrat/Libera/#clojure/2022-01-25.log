[16:39:14] <ridcully_> are you using the Path or URI c'tor?
[16:40:33] <Para> fwiw there's a whole separate java.util.jar.* package for dealing with JAR files specifically
[16:43:08] <Para> For that particular error, it's possible the JAR is corrupted but only just ever so at the end; the last segment of ZIP is a section which describes the ZIP's contents, which is also why ZIPs are not really streamable, as one has to first read the whole thing to find this section if you care about file names...
[16:43:40] <Para> This name section is not needed and it has no internal validation, so you can say all your file segments are named "a" and it'll be totally fine with that, until unzip.
[16:44:09] <ridcully_> which could mean the generator forgot to close()
[16:44:45] <ridcully_> but then, why would `jar` not complain?  have they stripped checks out?
[16:45:30] <ridcully_> (asks me, who basically never uses `jar` but unzip or vim)
[16:46:05] <Para> To my understanding jar is way better guarded against weird trash and corruptions than what the standard would really allow.
[16:46:50] <Para> Which IMHO is weird since jar is way older than build tools, so I'd imagine at the very beginning of times jars were all built using standard BSD command line utilities.
[16:47:27] <sobel> i've tried with Path and URI constructions
[16:47:55] <sobel> it's a zip i get from the government, and i can browse/unzip it with 'jar' and unzip

[17:05:18] <sobel> i'm gonna try with other zip files and jars. i forgot to establish whether this is systemic or just this file.
[17:05:21] <sobel> or just this file source
[17:08:03] <ridcully_> isn't that the "official" notation for a file url?
[17:08:17] <ridcully_> file:// is the protocol and then /... is the absolute path?
[17:08:36] <sobel> no wait, it takes that when i urlencode it right (this filename comes with spaces in it)
[17:08:48] <ridcully_> i had to add the jar to make the FileSystems thingy recognize it as zip
[17:10:05] <sobel> yeah, i've been using jar:file too. Paths.get was encoding for me before i tried making the URI
[17:13:15] <sobel> oh lordy, of course the zip i create with jar works.
[17:13:45] <sobel> now i get to figure out why onle FileSystem cares about the defects in this zip
[17:13:54] <sobel> only FileSystem cares
[17:16:23] <ridcully_> if the end is borked: when you create the zip, do you close the file handle?

[19:58:00] <mwnaylor> ddgiyf; I was about to ask if there was a way to get lein to use a different software license, but a quick search revealed this: https://github.com/xsc/lein-license
[19:58:48] <Para> umm what
[19:59:07] <Para> Like sure, just slap another license there but you're phrasing that a bit weird :)
[20:02:03] <mwnaylor> lein sets the default in the LICENSE file and in project.clj. Always an option to change manually, but that gets tedious. And why do you find my phrasing to be weird?
[20:02:25] <ridcully_> create your own template
[20:02:34] <ridcully_> or pick a template, that fits your need better
[20:02:55] <Para> mwnaylor: I first read that as changing lein's own license, not just your project's :)
[20:03:19] <ridcully_> then use `lein new <template> <project>`
[20:06:51] <mwnaylor> Para: Rereading my post, I see that now. 
[20:07:55] <mwnaylor> ridcully_: I guess to do that, I would copy and modify the supplied library and app templates.
[20:14:31] <ridcully_> depends on what you are after.  my default is done from scratch because i had to remove more than what i wanted to keep.  see the docs https://cljdoc.org/d/leiningen/leiningen/2.9.8/doc/writing-templates - it also has the link to the included templates

[20:15:19] <ridcully_> i dont know if there is a good way to hunt for templates to maybe find one that matches your usecase better
[20:16:44] <sobel> ridcully_: i'd like to know how jar copes with that corrupted zipfile. i want to dogfood what they're dogfooding!
[20:17:11] <Para> sobel: meant to mention, afaik JarFile does not reuse zip stream stuff
[20:17:31] <sobel> good, because that saves me a test-impl using zip streams
[20:17:57] <ridcully_> sobel: might also work with the jdk1.0 zip stuff.  i had not tested with this
[20:18:56] <Para> I don't remember why but absolutely ages ago I once made a wrapper for JarFile which simply tracked how many bytes of the file it actually read just to list the files and it was something like +80%...
[20:19:21] <Para> This has to have been like 10 years ago at least.

[21:51:09] <sobel> there was some hint of ZipFile using the central directory, and thus being able to repair this case of corruption (garbage past EOF marker) but i'm not gonna pursue it
