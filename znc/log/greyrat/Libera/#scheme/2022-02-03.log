[00:01:15] <Zipheir> That is advice I've gotten from a Lisper; I have to say, it proved to be just folklore.
[00:01:28] <sham1> Could be, but that could also be mitigated by culture
[00:02:00] <sham1> I would say that not having mutation-based structure operations could be seen as artificially crippling the language for some idea of functional purity

[00:03:25] <Zipheir> sham1: Sure, some *would* see it that way.
[00:04:22] <Zipheir> I do think we want mutation, but in a more controlled way than what Scheme currently offers.
[00:04:36] <sham1> I mean even Haskell, the posterchild of "everything functional and immutable now!" has the ability to do mutations and mutable data structures when needed

[00:05:02] <Zipheir> Paraphrasing Oleg, there are no languages without effects; the difference is how they control those effects.

[00:05:31] <Zipheir> sham1: Yes.  The notion of "functional" has evolved.

[00:07:15] <Franciman> i mean
[00:07:17] <Franciman> not in standard scheme
[00:07:25] <Franciman> but delconts are tightly bound to algebraic effects
[00:07:27] <Zipheir> Hah, yes.
[00:07:35] <Zipheir> We should be able to do it.
[00:09:05] <sham1> I mean, I am not opposed to having more functional data structures like finger trees available, and more immutable versions of stuff like vectors or strings (and maybe even making them the default, at least for strings)
[00:09:31] *** Joins: badkins (~badkins@136.56.92.199)
[00:10:00] <sham1> If R8RS was to ever happen, I wouldn't be opposed to having mutable vectors and such be their own library separate from the default. Available if needed but not included by default
[00:10:27] *** Quits: museee (~museee@user/museee) (Quit: Leaving)
[00:11:26] <Zipheir> We have immutable equivalents to vectors in the sense of structures that act like functions from ℕ to arbitrary values with better-than-O(n) access and lookup.  SRFI 101 and the more recent SRFI 224.
[00:12:34] <Zipheir> (SRFI 224 fixnum mapping don't take advantage of sequential indices, so they're more map-like, as the name suggests.)
[00:12:37] <Zipheir> *mappings
[00:13:21] <Zipheir> sham1: Agreed.  I don't see much use for mutable pairs, either, but that's a big change.

[00:14:44] <sham1> I do wonder if the integer maps have the same operations as the Guile intmaps
[00:15:28] <sham1> It does seem like it
[00:15:30] <Zipheir> Probably not at all.
[00:15:57] <Zipheir> Oh?  I'm surprised.  We didn't even look at Guile's library when working on that SRFI, unfortunately.
[00:17:16] <sham1> Well from a quick glance it does seem that it would have most of it
[00:17:27] <Zipheir> That's good to hear. :)
[00:17:40] <sham1> Since guile intmaps are mostly a tree-like mapping from integers to whatever, which they use for their CPS soup stuff
[00:17:43] <leah2> go 17
[00:17:57] <leah2> need to fix my / key :>
[00:18:05] <Zipheir> Quite possibly the same radix tree structure.
[00:18:26] <Zipheir> Well, as the sample implementation for 224.
[00:18:37] <Zipheir> No specific structure is specified, of course.

[00:20:55] <Zipheir> "Intmaps have a tree-like structure that is well-suited to set operations such as union and intersection..."  This definitely sounds like Okasaki-Gill radix trees.  They're pretty magical in that two maps just "zip together", joined by a single node in the best cases.

[00:22:05] *** Joins: badkins (~badkins@136.56.92.199)
[00:22:13] <sham1> I like this question in the Clojure docs linked from the Guile: "If a pure function mutates some local data in order to produce an immutable return value, is that okay?" That's certainly something functional programmers tend to grapple with
[00:22:17] *** civodul` is now known as civodul
[00:22:36] <Zipheir> intmap-next & -prev are kind of funky.
[00:22:50] *** Joins: aeth (~aeth@user/aeth)
[00:22:53] <Zipheir> Traversal should just skip missing keys, I think.
[00:23:21] <sham1> Yeah
[00:23:53] <Zipheir> "Is that OK?" is a pretty underspecified question there.
[00:25:11] <sham1> I do get what the question is about. Some might consider internal mutation as an affront to an otherwise pure algorithm, even if it's done for speed and the side-effect isn't really observable outside
[00:25:15] <Zipheir> It is a very interesting and subtle issue.
[00:25:45] <Zipheir> Right, it happens all the time.
[00:28:00] <Zipheir> At some level, it describes every "pure" algorithm.
[00:29:11] <Zipheir> "This gets translated to a bunch of side-effecting processor instructions, but it reliably behaves as a true function."

[14:24:46] <paul_j> Good morning all! I am getting the message about ensuring I load org mode from elpa as the org repository is closing down. Currently I am using the built in org mode, although I noticed I still had the link to the repository in my package code. Having removed this, I am still getting the message. Can anyone advise what is triggering the message? Do I need to do something specific to stop the message from appearing, and to prepare for
[14:24:46] <paul_j> the change? Thanks!

[22:32:02] <attila_lendvai> i'm basically looking for the equivalent of `(foo ,(some-call-at-exand-time)) in CL macros
[22:32:24] <Zipheir> What is define-syntax-rule?
[22:32:48] <dpk> attila_lendvai: no, syntax-rules can't do that. you need to use syntax-case or whatever other low-level macro system your Scheme provides
[22:32:55] <Zipheir> ^
[22:33:14] <dpk> (syntax-rules is Turing-complete in its own right, i should note, if you're masochistic enough to want to write recursively-expanding macros)
[22:33:38] <Zipheir> The thing about the syntax-rules language is that it's not Scheme.

[22:34:36] <attila_lendvai> dpk, hrm, that's what i suspected. so, something like #`(foo #,(datum->syntax s (some-call-at-expand-time))) in a syntax-case?
[22:34:52] <Zipheir> *shrug*  'Language' is clear enough.
[22:34:53] <dpk> yes
[22:35:03] <Franciman> is there any unicode library implemented in scheme?
[22:35:13] <dpk> Unicode library to do what?
[22:35:30] <sham1> It's gonna be interesting once one has to actually start thinking how to do phasing with function imports and such with R7-large and syntax-case
[22:35:30] <Franciman> normalisation, check character properties
[22:35:36] <Franciman> deal with at least utf8 encoding
[22:35:43] <dpk> no
[22:35:48] <dpk> not to my knowledge
[22:35:55] <Franciman> hmm then i am intrigued
[22:36:00] <Franciman> to write one
[22:36:05] <Franciman> but i don't want to die lol
[22:36:18] <sham1> Well the UCD isn't *that* bad
[22:36:24] <sham1> It's just a lot of busywork
[22:36:27] <dpk> R6RS has normalization procedures, and you can check very basic category information with the char-*? predicates
[22:36:34] <dpk> e.g. char-alphabetic? etc
[22:36:38] <Franciman> really?
[22:36:40] <Zipheir> Franciman: For just UTF-8 encoding/decoding https://wiki.call-cc.org/eggref/5/utf8
[22:37:03] <Zipheir> SRFI 135 has embedded UTF-8 and UTF-16 decoding/encoding as well.
[22:37:04] <Franciman> thanks
[22:37:11] <dpk> yeah, and R6 and R7RS both have utf8->string and string->utf8 for encoding/decoding between bytevectors and strings
[22:37:24] <Franciman> what bothers me is normalisation
[22:37:24] <dpk> (though, sigh, the R7 and the R6 versions are incompatible)
[22:37:52] <Zipheir> Franciman: Yeah, that's a big gap in Scheme libraries.
[22:38:08] <Franciman> well, i gotta say it's a general big gap
[22:38:11] <Franciman> not just scheme :P
[22:38:15] <Zipheir> Indeed. :-/
[22:38:15] <Franciman> C++ doesn't have one either
[22:38:25] <Franciman> there is libicu, tho
[22:38:53] <dpk> that way madness lies

[22:41:34] <Franciman> honestly i don't know if normalisation is necessary for comparing two identifiers in a programming language

[22:41:48] <dpk> no, forget about it, heh
[22:41:56] <dpk> leave it for the second version ;-)
[22:41:59] <Franciman> lol
[22:42:20] <sham1> Normalisation is madness. Especially when you need to choose which normalisation to use
[22:42:55] <sham1> NFC? NFKC? or what
[22:43:03] <sham1> And then you have to justify to the users why
[22:43:43] <dpk> earlier drafts of R7RS had string-ni=?, which would have compared two strings normalization-insensitively
[22:43:55] <dpk> it was removed from the final version, but might make a return in Large
[22:44:02] <sham1> Oh goodie
[22:45:01] <Zipheir> We'll have to deal with it eventually.  Unicode isn't going anywhere, I think.
[22:45:40] <sham1> RE leaving stuff for version 2, doing the extended lexical syntax would be something an implementation might want to do anyway if they don't have some way of checking character classes, since r7rs.pdf does specify at least Lu, Ll, Lt and such
[22:46:09] <sham1> The only ones that are easy to check even without being especially Unicode-aware are U+200C and U+200D
[22:46:34] <dpk> R7RS small doesn't require anything more than ASCII ;-)
