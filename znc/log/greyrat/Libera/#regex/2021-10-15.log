[11:24:16] <re101-quokka-93> Hi, I need help with some regex in python. The regex of the following expression already does what it should but how do I implement this in python? I have a dataframe and I would apply it on a certain column. I tried the following: df["column"].str.extract(r"[at][-]([0-9]+)"). However, I only get NaN back. Link: https://regex101.com/r/mdOhE4/1   So
[11:24:16] <re101-quokka-93> if anybody knows where the problem is... Thanks for your help :)
[11:33:38] <digitok> no idea, but how about df["column"].str.extract(pat = r"[at]-(\d+)")
[11:35:03] <re101-quokka-93> Unfortunately, this does not work either.
[11:36:19] <digitok> is df["column"] itself an object?
[11:36:22] <digitok> or is df the object
[11:36:43] <digitok> ie is df["column"] just a string
[11:37:53] <mindhunter> Hey I am using sed to fetch lines that contain the word microsoft but matched lines that contain the pattern telemetry should be omitted. How exactly do i negate a particular string of characters? using [^telemetry] doesnt seem to work
[11:38:43] <re101-quokka-93> df["column"] itself is an object
[11:39:33] <digitok> i see
[11:39:47] <digitok> no idea tbh, i was just going by what's shown here https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-pandas-series-str-extract/
[11:41:04] <digitok> 07mindhunter, i don't know how to do it in sed, but i can give you a regex to be used with perl or grep -P

[19:30:32] <re101-wombat-52> Thanks for that, but it turns out that I have other strings that are slightly different, which I didn't realize, and the regex doesn't quite work on them.
[19:30:45] <re101-wombat-52> So I added them to the test string.
[19:31:09] <re101-wombat-52> Is there anyone who can help me understand this: https://regex101.com/r/Gvdyl0/1
[19:32:34] <re101-wombat-52> The first block of text in the test string works as expected, but the next text block has an extra set of () which throws off the regex.
[19:33:32] <re101-wombat-52> I do not understand how to account for that.
[19:34:02] <re101-wombat-52> Then the next block of text does not follow the same format and it is not selected at all.
[19:35:06] <re101-wombat-52> So I am trying to come up with a universal regex that will work on all the different strings and provide the same result, which is a set of groups selected that I can then assign to python strings.
[19:35:52] <re101-wombat-52> The idea is that I would make a function with the regex in it and then feed it the blocks of code and it would return the strings I want.
[19:36:50] <re101-wombat-52> Would it be better to make different regex statements or a single statement that can account for the different input blocks?

[19:47:50] <digitok> 2*
[19:53:38] <re101-wombat-52> digitok, the text after "namespace(known=Namespace(" needs to be selected before and after the "=" but not include ", "
[19:57:06] <re101-wombat-52> Although, I do not know exactly how I want to handle that because they are arguments sent to the python program and the argparse library seperates known arguments from unknown arguments, so I might want to make a list of the known arguments, and a list of the unknown arguments . . . but I am actually having trouble getting the unknown variables to
[19:57:06] <re101-wombat-52> be assigned to the unknown list at the moment.  So for now I am just trying to group the known variables separately..
[19:59:20] <re101-wombat-52> I do admit that it seems like what I am doing is marginally convoluted.
[20:00:47] <re101-wombat-52> At this point, I am just enjoying learning how to sift through text with regular expressions.
[20:01:53] <digitok> so stuff like  ASSET_INDEX=[-1, 0] being split at , is what you want?
[20:03:13] <re101-wombat-52> digitok, I would like to keep "ASSET_INDEX=[-1, 0]" as a group and split at the ", " after it.
[20:04:13] <digitok> yep, that was the next issue after we fixed this one ;)
