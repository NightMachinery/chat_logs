[03:01:59] <TRS-80> The way I migrated from custom was first to start putting those in a separate file; there is a setting for that.  Then start copying them over one by one after studying and understanding what each one did.
[03:02:02] <sm> TRS-80: it's not, no matter what I do the key is bound to indent-for-tab-command from indent.el in global-map. Is that what you're saying bpalmer  ?
[03:03:08] <TRS-80> But this worked before (I gather this is same outshine problem from earlier)?
[03:03:12] <sm> yes, I think I don't want to go all the way to babel or other transformations, just lightweight folding of big files has been terrific for me in the past. I.. just.. can.. not.. keep.. it.. working.. from year to year

[03:04:34] <bpalmer> sm: oh, no, what you had would cause the global map to be shadowed, I think

[03:23:26] <sm> byte compiling didn't change anything
[03:25:27] <bpalmer> I'm not sure that emacs ever looks at .el.gz
[03:25:47] <bpalmer> typically, it will look at .el , .elc, and files with neither appended.

[03:28:45] <sm> after editing .el.gz, I recompiled the elc (by pressing B on the .el.gz in dired); I thought that would do it
[03:29:14] <sm> is this file possibly inlined in the executable and not loaded by default ? I do see the error if I manually (load "indent")
[03:30:04] <bpalmer> yes, it's possible; when you compile emacs it first builds a binary named "temacs" and then loads a bunch of lisp files into it; then it "dumps" into a new binary named "emacs"
[03:30:19] <sm> if I just start emacs -q, the file seems not to get loaded, but TAB is still bound to that function
[03:30:20] <bpalmer> the new binary already has all that elisp loaded up so it saves time.
[03:30:30] <sm> I think it must be this
[03:30:52] <bpalmer> Modifying core libraries like indent.el is a very unusual step; I guess you're debugging things but I wouldn't recommend it.

[03:31:11] <sm> yeah, just debugging
[03:31:48] <sm> soo... a file built in to my executable sets TAB in the global map. To rebind that for my own needs.. it seems I need to alter it in global map ? AFAICT it overrides everything else
[03:31:55] <TRS-80> I think you are not also understanding what emacs -q does; it does not touch your existing config
[03:31:59] *** Joins: s-liao (~s-liao@101.86.96.21)
[03:32:14] <TRS-80> it gives you a "vanilla" emacs for testing purposes
[03:32:22] <TRS-80> then you see if you can reproduce the issue
[03:32:28] <sm> TRS-80: it wouldn't load the new config I'm testing.. but you're right, that didn't matter. Vanilla was fine here
[03:32:48] <TRS-80> forget about loading configs
[03:32:48] <bpalmer> sm: when a key is pressed, it is looked up in a few different places: any local overlays or text properties have that a keymap property. Then it goes to any minor modes that are active. Then the current local map. Then lastly the global map.
[03:33:03] <TRS-80> so you are saying it works in vanilla?
[03:33:45] <bpalmer> sm: when a key is looked up in a map, it first looks at the exact map for that key; then it checks default keybinding; then it goes through each of the map's parent maps in turn.
[03:33:57] <sm> TRS-80: the same problem in vanilla, for reasons now understood I think. bpalmer, that's what I thought, but local-set-key had no impact. I will try more
[03:34:40] <bpalmer> sm: this means if you're pressing a key and it's found in the global map, either it's not bound in any of your minor mode or local maps , or *maybe* one of them has erroneously decided to make the global map a parent keymap.
[03:34:52] <bpalmer> sm: you can look up a binding yourself in a map using lookup-key

[18:32:06] <jrm> But take all that with a grain of salt.  I don't have any Windows 11 systems to verify.

[23:15:54] <babilen> Hi all! What is the best way to follow up on a bugfix that seems to have introduced broken code? Ever since Bug#51549 was fixed, I'm getting errors to the effect that (void-function string-replace). Reverting flymake to an earlier commit results in the desired (i.e. non-broken) behaviour.
