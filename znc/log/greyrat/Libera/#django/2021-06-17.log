[05:28:44] <wallbroken> let me search on google
[05:28:58] <PaulWay[w]> nedbat: he probably knows what it is in code, but not how it fits together conceptually.
[05:29:14] <PaulWay[w]> wallbroken: you already know the model bit - that's a Django model.
[05:29:20] <PaulWay[w]> It's a model of the data you're storing.
[05:29:27] *** Quits: Xof (~Xof@157-131-136-66.dedicated.static.sonic.net) (Quit: Bye.)
[05:29:36] <wallbroken> yes
[05:29:44] <PaulWay[w]> The "View" is the method of representing that data.  In Django that's a template; in DRF it's a serializer.
[05:30:15] <PaulWay[w]> The "Controller" is the code that works out what data to retrieve, and which view to present it in.
[05:30:23] <PaulWay[w]> Confusingly, Django calls this a "view".
[05:30:59] <PaulWay[w]> That's what a 'view' is in Django: the code for each 'view' of data in your system.
[05:31:20] <PaulWay[w]> Does that all make sense so far, at the simplest level
[05:31:21] <PaulWay[w]> ?
[05:31:48] <wallbroken> is not quite clear "is the method of rapresenting that data"
[05:32:37] <PaulWay[w]> What I mean by that is: the view is the code that gets data from the models, and represents it to the user using the template.
[05:33:01] <PaulWay[w]> The view code may make decisions about what the user can see, or how they see it.
[05:33:16] <PaulWay[w]> It may need to pull together data from multiple models.
[05:33:21] <PaulWay[w]> With me now?
[05:34:00] <wallbroken> yes, it's like a database query?
[05:34:21] <wallbroken> select * from table where condition1; condition2....
[05:34:27] <PaulWay[w]> At a very simple level, yes, but a view is much more than just the query.

[05:36:48] <PaulWay[w]> You can probably see from the code you've written in your own views that they do more than just perform queries.
[05:37:31] <wallbroken> yes, it handles request/responses
[05:37:36] <PaulWay[w]> Yep.
[05:37:41] <PaulWay[w]> What else do they do?
[05:37:44] <wallbroken> so they are not just a way to rapresenting data
[05:39:20] <PaulWay[w]> Yes!
[05:39:35] <PaulWay[w]> That's why they're called 'controllers' in the MVC concept.
[05:40:01] <wallbroken> and they does not get the data just from the model
[05:40:02] <PaulWay[w]> Because they really 'control' the user's interaction with the website.
[05:40:09] <wallbroken> but also from an http request
[05:40:13] <PaulWay[w]> Yes to that too.

[05:41:08] <wallbroken> here
[05:41:22] <wallbroken> you see that there are *args, **kwargs
[05:41:27] <PaulWay[w]> Yep.
[05:41:27] <wallbroken> what do they are?
[05:41:36] <PaulWay[w]> Ahh, now that's an interesting question :-)
[05:41:59] <wallbroken> in C * is a special character used to resolve an address reference
[05:42:11] <PaulWay[w]> The stars there are Python specific mark-up.
[05:42:26] <wallbroken> it's not the same as in C language?
[05:42:31] <PaulWay[w]> So in C, you know how you can have some functions that can take a variable number of parameters?
[05:42:41] <wallbroken> yes
[05:43:04] <PaulWay[w]> And you then have a kind of special 'varargs' system of handling them, but the function definition has to have '...' as an argument?
[05:43:34] <wallbroken> now i don't remember specifically
[05:43:46] <PaulWay[w]> The '...' being a special C mark-up that says 'you'll get multiple arguments here, deal with it'.
[05:43:50] <bparker> the wallbroken saga continues
[05:43:58] <PaulWay[w]> bparker: indeed.
[05:44:00] <PaulWay[w]> We're learning.
[05:44:07] <wallbroken> bparker: grab some pop corn
[05:44:16] <bparker> but are you getting paid is the question /s
[05:45:18] <wallbroken> PaulWay[w]: ok, i did get what * is
[05:45:22] <PaulWay[w]> So in Python, if you have a function that you want to take a variable number of arguments, you put a * before any variable name in its argument list and Python will stuff all the spare arguments to that function into a list and put that list in that argument.
[05:45:29] <wallbroken> function(*args)
[05:45:52] <PaulWay[w]> (That's why *args = short for arguments).
[05:45:54] *** Quits: clemente (~Daniel@balticom-142-72-136.balticom.lv) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[05:46:08] <PaulWay[w]> Since Python also takes keyword arguments, it has another special mark-up to take keywords as a dictionary - that's **kwargs.
[05:46:14] <PaulWay[w]> Make sense?
[05:46:17] <wallbroken>       for number in args
[05:46:30] <wallbroken>      output * number
[05:46:38] <wallbroken>        return output
[05:46:42] <wallbroken> so if i use that function
[05:46:58] <wallbroken> function(2, 2, 2)
[05:47:05] <wallbroken> i'll get 8
[05:47:07] <wallbroken> right?
[05:47:17] <PaulWay[w]> Well, excusing a lot of the actual niceties of Python, yes.
[05:47:31] <PaulWay[w]> It's worth playing around with this in a small program to get used to it.
[05:47:33] <wallbroken> and in the case of double star?
[05:47:35] <wallbroken> **
[05:47:52] <PaulWay[w]> Then you get a dictionary with any keyword arguments.
[05:48:04] <wallbroken> ok
[05:48:21] <PaulWay[w]> in `def fun(**kwargs):`, 'kwargs' is a dictionary.
[05:48:33] <wallbroken> so
[05:48:34] <wallbroken> https://github.com/ClaudioViti/lookbook/blob/multi-user-registration/shoes/views.py#L36
[05:48:36] <wallbroken> for example here
[05:48:55] <wallbroken> we are defining a method of ShoeListView class
[05:48:56] <PaulWay[w]> fun(moon=1, stars=2, sun=3) will have kwargs={'moon': 1, 'stars': 2, 'sun': 3}
[05:49:29] <PaulWay[w]> Yep.
[05:49:30] <wallbroken> dispatch method takes as input
[05:49:47] <wallbroken> self, request, *args, **kwargs)
[05:50:17] <wallbroken> why we need *args in this case?
[05:51:11] *** Quits: elena (~elena@202-153-212-80.ca99d4.syd.static.aussiebb.net) (Quit: Client closed)
[05:51:41] <PaulWay[w]> Here's the overview: dispatch is a method of ListView that does the work of handling this request.
[05:52:10] <PaulWay[w]> The ListView's dispatch method can be called with a range of arguments, from within Django, depending on the circumstances.
[05:52:11] <FunkyBob> being a GENERIC view, it cant' know how many arguments will be passed to the view from url routing.
[05:52:26] <PaulWay[w]> We don't know what those arguments are, or if they're listed or keyword arguments.
[05:52:54] <PaulWay[w]> So '*args, **kwargs' catches all the arguments given to ShoeListView's dispatch() method.
[05:53:16] <bparker> the ones that aren't already named
[05:53:17] <PaulWay[w]> Then the same notation (kind of in reverse, at least in my head) stuffs them back into the argument list to the ListView's dispatch() method.
[05:53:51] <PaulWay[w]> Yes.  The ones that are named within the method declaration are handled by Python first, and then everything else is stuffed into args and kwargs.
[05:54:16] <PaulWay[w]> Then when we call super().dispatch() we give it `*args, **kwargs`.
[05:54:20] <wallbroken> in my way of thinking, i see a method as something that takes some input and gies some output
[05:54:29] <wallbroken> in this case the input are: the request
[05:54:29] <PaulWay[w]> That's correct.
[05:54:40] <wallbroken> the list of args, and the list of dicts
[05:55:21] <wallbroken> the return returns "request" (why?, is it the same as the input?)
[05:56:39] <wallbroken> but have a look to the code. i think that when i declare a method in a class, you'd expect that the metod would be used by the instance object of that class
[05:56:43] <wallbroken> and, where is it?
[05:57:32] <PaulWay[w]> It's used within Django.
[05:57:42] <PaulWay[w]> Django understands how to use GenericViews such as ListView.
[05:58:02] <PaulWay[w]> And deep down in the machinery of Django, it calls the `dispatch` method.
[05:58:05] <wallbroken> so it's called "dispatch" for a functional reason?
[05:58:35] <PaulWay[w]> It's called `dispatch` because that sounds more elegant and refined than 'execute' or 'go' or 'do_stuff'.
[05:58:38] <PaulWay[w]> :-D
[05:59:10] <wallbroken> so, django will create an instance of the ShoeListView class and inside of it will use that method?
[05:59:14] <PaulWay[w]> Yep.
[05:59:31] <FunkyBob> well, the function created by .as_view() creates the instance
[05:59:38] <PaulWay[w]> Now, when you graduate from using generic views, you'll find your view methods actually getting called :-)
[06:01:17] <bparker> I'm old school, I still use one plain method for both GET/POST, no class-based views
[06:01:23] <FunkyBob> i still say CBGV only confuse new users and obfuscate what's going on for them
[06:01:47] <PaulWay[w]> Yes.  I agree.
[06:02:00] <wallbroken> why sometimes is used a view class, and why sometimes is used a view function?
[06:02:11] <bparker> personal preference
[06:02:15] <FunkyBob> because some things you want to do are handled by the generic views
[06:02:17] <FunkyBob> and some aren't
[06:02:20] <PaulWay[w]> This is why I'm working on https://github.com/PaulWay/django-viewsets
[06:02:28] <bparker> the class way wasn't introduced until later in django's life IIRC
[06:02:34] <bparker> some people still use the old way
[06:02:47] <FunkyBob> class-based generic views are far nicer than the old generic views
[06:03:00] <FunkyBob> but how django itself handles views hasn't changed
[06:03:06] <PaulWay[w]> Because generic views are single-endpoint and I want the 'entire path in one view class' idea that DRF uses.
[06:03:14] <wallbroken> from shoes.forms import ShoeForm, ShoeImageFormSet, ShoeImageInlineFormset, ShoeOrderForm, BrandForm, CartAddForm, UrgentAddForm, ShoeCartsForm, ShoeFavouriteForm, modelformset_factory
[06:03:17] <FunkyBob> there's actually no explicit support in the core of it for class-based views
[06:03:19] <wallbroken> this can be simply:
[06:03:24] <wallbroken> from shoes.forms import *
[06:03:26] <wallbroken> ?
[06:03:29] <bparker> sometimes
[06:03:36] <bparker> but it can create circular dependencies
[06:03:46] <FunkyBob> yes, but "import *" is discouraged because it can import more than you realise
[06:04:04] <wallbroken> ok
[06:04:14] <bparker> if you're in models.py and you import forms.*, but forms.py also imports models.py... whoops
[06:04:15] <wallbroken> now, if i want to analyze the entire flow:
[06:04:21] <wallbroken> i open an url
[06:04:29] *** Joins: Guddu (~Guddu@117.222.80.236)
[06:04:33] <wallbroken> the url is triggered by a url statement in urls.py
[06:04:52] <wallbroken> that url statement will create the instance of a generic class view
[06:04:53] <wallbroken> right?
[06:05:16] <bparker> depends on what the url statement is
[06:05:33] <bparker> it could point to a single function
[06:05:37] <bparker> or a class, or a generic view
[06:05:51] <bparker> class-based view*
[06:05:59] <wallbroken> for example, when i open my website, i will reach the root level
[06:06:01] <wallbroken> path('', ShoeListView.as_view()),
[06:06:02] <wallbroken> this
[06:06:22] <wallbroken> so, ShoeListView.as_view() will create an instance of that view class
[06:07:11] *** Joins: sbmsr (~pi@104-6-130-18.lightspeed.miamfl.sbcglobal.net)
[06:07:32] <wallbroken> class ShoeListView(LoginRequiredMixin, ListView):
[06:07:36] <wallbroken> needs two arguments
[06:07:46] <wallbroken> but when i create the instance i'm not passing any argument
[06:07:51] <FunkyBob> wallbroken: no
[06:07:52] <FunkyBob> no
[06:07:57] <FunkyBob> as_view does not create the instance
[06:08:05] <FunkyBob> it returns a view function that will create the instance
[06:08:16] <FunkyBob> [yes, it's a little confusing at first]
[06:08:25] <wallbroken> 3:29:31 AM - FunkyBob: well, the function created by .as_view() creates the instance
[06:08:29] <FunkyBob> yes
[06:08:34] <FunkyBob> the function created by as_view()
[06:08:41] <FunkyBob> calling as_view returns a new function
[06:08:47] <FunkyBob> _that_ function is the one that creates the instance
[06:08:50] <FunkyBob> _that_ function is the view function
[06:09:29] <FunkyBob> https://github.com/django/django/blob/main/django/views/generic/base.py#L48
[06:09:51] <FunkyBob> In terchnical terms View.as_view is a "view function factory"
[06:10:14] <bparker> like the infamous RequestProcessorFactoryFactory
[06:10:35] <wallbroken> ok, so as_view() creates a new function which create the instance of the view class
[06:10:45] <wallbroken> but the question is: the view class needs 2 arguments
[06:10:50] <wallbroken> who is passing them?
[06:10:57] <bparker> classes do not have arguments
[06:11:00] <FunkyBob> the url matching machinery
[06:11:06] <wallbroken> of there is a class overloading?

[06:11:45] <FunkyBob> https://github.com/django/django/blob/main/django/views/generic/base.py#L61-L69
[06:12:02] <FunkyBob> that's the view function it creates... it creates the class isntance, then calls dispatch

[06:13:48] <wallbroken> now i remember

[06:14:53] <FunkyBob> dispatch() is called
[06:14:55] <FunkyBob> in this case
[06:15:07] <wallbroken> it's the first triggered method?
[06:15:10] <FunkyBob> the default implementation of that works out what to call based on the HTTP Method of the request
[06:15:18] <FunkyBob> https://github.com/django/django/blob/main/django/views/generic/base.py#L69
[06:15:28] <FunkyBob> https://github.com/django/django/blob/main/django/views/generic/base.py#L93-L101
[06:16:18] <wallbroken> ok
[06:16:27] <FunkyBob> this is, of course, covered here - https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/topics/class-based-views/intro/
[06:17:34] <wallbroken> so, when do i need to create a view class to handle a request, the first method i need to implement is dispatch()
[06:17:43] <FunkyBob> never
[06:17:51] <FunkyBob> no, you do not need to implement dispatch
[06:18:05] <FunkyBob> that's why you sub-class an existing view class...
[06:18:13] <FunkyBob> so you don't have to reimplement what's already done
[06:18:15] <FunkyBob> otherwise, what's the point?
[06:18:39] <FunkyBob> it seems you are having a hard time, still, with understanding inheritance
[06:19:30] <FunkyBob> the reason for creating class-based generic views is classes make it easy to say "I want something that works like that, but a little different"

[06:20:04] <wallbroken> here i'm defining a method
[06:20:15] <wallbroken> i'm not inheriting anything
[06:20:21] <FunkyBob> yes, because you want to do that work no matter if it's a GET or POST or whatever...
[06:20:27] <FunkyBob> yuou fucking well are
[06:20:32] <FunkyBob> class ShoeListView(LoginRequiredMixin, ListView):
[06:20:38] <FunkyBob> your class inherits from those two others
[06:20:39] <FunkyBob> AND
[06:20:43] <FunkyBob>         return super().dispatch(request, *args, **kwargs)
[06:20:50] <FunkyBob> you finish by using the parent classes dispatch method
[06:21:08] <wallbroken> ok, but i did not get the first part
[06:21:15] <wallbroken> 3:50:21 AM - FunkyBob: yes, because you want to do that work no matter if it's a GET or POST or whatever...
[06:21:16] <FunkyBob> which 'first part'?
[06:21:26] <FunkyBob> lines 37-38
[06:21:31] <FunkyBob> extra work to be done in that view
[06:22:12] <FunkyBob> as explained before, dispatch() figures out if this is a GET, POST, DELETE or whatever request... and calls t he right method for that
[06:22:14] <wallbroken> if the method who is doing the work is from the parent class, why i'm refining the same one in the child class?
[06:22:29] <FunkyBob> because you want it to do things differently
[06:22:37] <FunkyBob> can you not see in that code it's doing more?
[06:23:36] <wallbroken> wait
[06:23:51] <wallbroken> you just told that dispatch() is used to discriminate between POST and GET
[06:23:58] <FunkyBob> yes
[06:24:20] <wallbroken> now, from what i read inside of that method definition, it wants GET requests
[06:24:26] <FunkyBob> no
[06:24:34] <FunkyBob> you mean because it references request.GET?
[06:24:39] <wallbroken> yes
[06:24:47] <FunkyBob> that's a poor naming choice we're sort of stuck with
[06:25:01] <FunkyBob> request.GET contains the parsed query string data... that is, everything after the ? in the url
[06:25:27] <wallbroken> like a dictionary?
[06:25:50] <FunkyBob> like that, but a littl more complex because querystrings allow multiple values for a single key
[06:26:12] <wallbroken> also dictionary
[06:26:16] <wallbroken> they are called arrays
[06:26:20] <FunkyBob> no
[06:26:27] <FunkyBob> PHP calls them Array
[06:26:50] <wallbroken> well, going back to the topic
[06:26:51] <FunkyBob> associative array is another name...
[06:27:20] <wallbroken> request.GET contains the url string parsed data
[06:27:22] <wallbroken> ok
[06:28:09] <wallbroken> is still not clear why we're defining a dispatch() in the child class but then we return something using the dispatch() parent class
[06:28:28] <PaulWay[w]> Because you're setting properties of self in that child class's method.
[06:29:13] <FunkyBob> wallbroken: in this case, as I've said... you want that work done no matter if it's a GET or a POST request
[06:29:30] <FunkyBob> if you wanted it only on aGET request, you'd typically write it into the get method
[06:29:37] <FunkyBob> for instance
[06:30:01] <FunkyBob> so that method overrides the default, sets up those form instances, then says "ok, do the original dispatch"
[06:30:19] <wallbroken> so, if we don't care if it's post or get, we shouldn't use dispatch() at all
[06:30:30] <FunkyBob> huh?
[06:30:36] <FunkyBob> how do you figure that?
[06:30:38] <wallbroken> because it's purpose is to discriminate between the request
[06:31:00] <FunkyBob> yes... it gets called first... then it decides whether to call get() or post() or delete() or put() or whatever
[06:31:20] <FunkyBob> you have no choice... it gets called.. as you saw in the as_view() generated view I showed you
[06:32:10] <wallbroken> it gets called? WE are calling it
[06:32:13] <wallbroken> return super().dispatch(request, *args, **kwargs)
[06:32:25] <FunkyBob> _your_ dispatch gets called by the view function
[06:32:34] <FunkyBob> does its setup work... then calls t he original dispatch
[06:32:44] <FunkyBob> which dispatches the request to the right handler method
[06:33:28] <FunkyBob> super() is how you access the super-class... the class(es) you're inheriting from
[06:33:57] <wallbroken> yes, and the super class dispatch() method can't be directly called?
[06:34:37] <FunkyBob> well, not since you've defined your own dispatch method on your class
[06:34:47] <wallbroken> if you don't define a new dispatch method, the one in the super class will be called
[06:34:49] <wallbroken> or no?
[06:34:53] <FunkyBob> yes
[06:35:12] <FunkyBob> it might help to think of your class as an "overlay" on the methods and properties of the parents
[06:35:28] <wallbroken> ok, so, if i remove my own dispatch metod, do you think it will work?
[06:35:59] <FunkyBob> for ShoeListView?  doesn't it need self.filter_form and self.order_form set?
[06:36:13] <FunkyBob> looking at the code, yes it does
[06:36:24] <wallbroken> yes
[06:36:31] <FunkyBob> however
[06:36:32] <wallbroken> but it can be done after dispatch
[06:36:40] <FunkyBob> it doesn't look like it handles a POST
[06:36:49] <FunkyBob> so it could be moved into get() or somewhere later in the process

[06:38:43] <wallbroken> so, let's move on.
[06:38:57] <wallbroken> dispatch returns a post, get, delete, update
[06:38:58] <wallbroken> right?
[06:39:18] <wallbroken> with parsed querystring
[06:39:20] <FunkyBob> it returns what calling one of those returns
[06:39:32] <FunkyBob> it figures out which one to call, and calls it
[06:39:41] <FunkyBob> https://github.com/django/django/blob/main/django/views/generic/base.py#L93-L101
[06:39:47] <FunkyBob> it's a really short function
[06:40:22] <wallbroken> so, if the request is a get, it returns a get
[06:40:27] <wallbroken> if it's a post, it returns a post?
[06:40:51] <FunkyBob> it doesn't "return a get"
[06:41:02] <FunkyBob> it calls the get() method, and returns whatever that method returns
[06:42:12] <wallbroken> ok but
[06:42:13] <wallbroken> self.filter_form = ShoeForm(request.GET)
[06:42:22] <wallbroken> when i'm passing request.GET inside of ShoeForm
[06:42:31] <wallbroken> i'm coming through dispatch() ?
[06:43:30] <FunkyBob> I don't understand the question
[06:43:38] <FunkyBob> that line of code is in the dispatch method on your view class, yes.
[06:44:18] <FunkyBob> it happens when your dispatch method is called.
[06:44:53] <wallbroken> yes i know
[06:45:09] <wallbroken> but i'm not getting the utility of dispatch()
[06:49:55] <FunkyBob> of your one? or the default one?
[06:50:18] <wallbroken> can I ask you both?
[06:50:39] <FunkyBob> your one does what the default one does... but creates those two form class instances first
[06:50:58] <FunkyBob> the default one... as you can see from the code I linked you to... calls the appropriate class method for the HTTP Method
[06:51:03] <FunkyBob> read the code
[06:51:08] <FunkyBob> it's tiny and clear and commented
[06:52:16] <FunkyBob> if it's a HTTP GET, it calls self.get()
[06:52:29] <FunkyBob> this makes it easier when writing a view to write code for handling different HTTP methods

[07:09:11] <FunkyBob> request.GET parses that into a more useful container

[07:10:04] <wallbroken> ok, and that is a different thing from this: https://dpaste.org/JFah
[07:10:28] <FunkyBob> that is looking at what the HTTP verb is.
[07:10:49] <FunkyBob> then seeing if there's a method of the same name [lower cased] on this class
[07:10:53] <FunkyBob> if so, it calls it
[07:11:00] <FunkyBob> if not, it uses its default error handler method
[07:11:12] <FunkyBob> well, method-not-allowed handler method
[07:11:32] <wallbroken> request.method.lower() it the part that takes in charge the identification of the request?
[07:12:05] <FunkyBob> as you've seen in your other code, you can use request.method to see if this is a GET, POST, DELETE, or whatever other HTTP method request
[07:12:17] <FunkyBob> so they take that string and lower-case it (using .lower())
[07:12:51] <FunkyBob> and when i say "your other code", I mean places like https://github.com/ClaudioViti/lookbook/blob/multi-user-registration/shoes/views.py#L253

[07:34:50] <FunkyBob> of dispatch in general?
[07:35:15] <FunkyBob> what's not to understand... it calls get() or post() or whatever if they exist... and otherwise calls the handler that generates a 405 status
[07:35:51] <FunkyBob> [note, this is why I said you shouldn't be using class-based views yet... they only add complexity and confusion for you]
[07:36:32] <wallbroken> it calls get(), post() to do what?
[07:36:42] <FunkyBob> to handle the request... to generate the response
[07:36:58] <FunkyBob> remember the definition of a view?
[07:37:17] <wallbroken> a way of rapresenting data?
[07:37:21] <FunkyBob> no
[07:37:24] <FunkyBob> not in django
[07:37:49] <FunkyBob> it's a function that accepts a request, and returns a response.
[07:38:04] <FunkyBob> specifically a HttpRequest instance, and a HttpResponse (or sub-class) instance.
[07:38:15] <wallbroken> oh yes i remember this definition

[07:41:17] *** Quits: dez (uid92154@user/dez) (Quit: Connection closed for inactivity)
[07:52:06] <wallbroken> a question: actually my project works in the following way:
[07:52:24] <wallbroken> an "admin" user can add/manage/remove items
[07:53:01] <wallbroken> the "base" users can just seee the items bounded to their account
[07:53:20] <wallbroken> an item can belong to multiple users
[07:54:08] <wallbroken> the base users cannot add/delete/remove items
[07:54:56] <wallbroken> my idea is that the base user should have the possibility to add items, and edit/delete those items that are bounded exclusively to their account
[07:55:38] <FunkyBob> edit/delete the items?  or edit/delete that the items are 'owned' by them?
[07:55:53] <wallbroken> let me show an example
[07:55:58] <wallbroken> we have 3 items
[07:56:06] <wallbroken> item1, item2, item3
[07:56:17] <wallbroken> item 1 is bounded to Bob, John, Sarah
[07:56:35] <wallbroken> item2 is bounded to Bob, item 3 is bounded to bob and Sarah
[07:56:56] <wallbroken> what i want to do is:
[07:57:24] <wallbroken> Bob can see item1 and item3
[07:57:29] *** Joins: mihael (~mihael@49.145.68.35)
[07:57:38] <wallbroken> Bob can see and edit/remove item2
[07:57:54] *** Quits: sbmsr (~pi@104-6-130-18.lightspeed.miamfl.sbcglobal.net) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[07:58:05] <FunkyBob> so here I'm trying to clarify what you mean by 'edit'
[07:58:08] <wallbroken> John can see item1 but he can't see item2 and item3
[07:58:17] <FunkyBob> by 'remove' I assume you mean it's not longer 'bound' to him
[07:58:36] <FunkyBob> but what is 'edit' in this context?
[07:59:10] <wallbroken> "edit" means modifying the fields from managent form i already have
[07:59:48] <wallbroken> the idea is: users can modify/remove items that are EXCLUSIVELY bounded to them
[07:59:49] <FunkyBob> stop saying "management form" like it's a thing
[08:00:08] <FunkyBob> you mean to edit the Item itself/
[08:00:09] <FunkyBob> ?
[08:00:32] <wallbroken> https://github.com/ClaudioViti/lookbook/blob/multi-user-registration/shoes/views.py#L275
[08:00:35] <FunkyBob> so t hey can edit any field on the Item, or remove it from their "list of things I can edit" ... but can't add new ones
[08:00:35] <wallbroken> this is it
[08:01:08] <wallbroken> they can add new ones
[08:01:13] <FunkyBob> fine, but you're bleeding into implementation...
[08:01:28] <wallbroken> the shared items can be edited/deleted ONLY by the admin user
[08:01:33] <wallbroken> like it's currently
[08:01:34] <FunkyBob> but you
[08:01:40] <FunkyBob> you just said anyone 'bound' to the item can edit it
[08:02:10] <wallbroken> there are some item that are in common
[08:02:20] <FunkyBob> or are you saying that _currently_ onl the admin can edit them?  and you want to change this?
[08:02:22] <wallbroken> and some other that belongs to one single suer
[08:02:29] <wallbroken> yes
[08:02:37] <FunkyBob> then be specific and explicit about t hat
[08:02:39] <wallbroken> now the admin manages them all
[08:02:53] <wallbroken> the single users can't do anything
[08:02:55] <FunkyBob> you keep assuming everyone else thinks like you do... despite all the evidence to the contrary
[08:02:58] <wallbroken> just view and order items
[08:03:25] <FunkyBob> so you want to make it so users can edit any items they 'own'
[08:03:37] <wallbroken> yes
[08:03:55] <FunkyBob> sounds like the Item needs an 'owners' M2M field... and the edit page needs to filter by that if the user is not admin
[08:04:30] <wallbroken> https://github.com/ClaudioViti/lookbook/blob/multi-user-registration/shoes/models.py#L130
[08:06:34] <FunkyBob> are you trying to imply that that's what your user field is for?
[08:07:49] <wallbroken> tha user field is to bound each item to some user
[08:08:12] <wallbroken> between user and item there is N:N relationship
[08:08:33] <FunkyBob> a Many-to-Many, yes

[08:11:23] <wallbroken> in the sense of if i go in manage mode, i will see the "add/edit/remove" buttons in the page

[08:17:02] *** Joins: pathos (~pathos@169-1-247-122.ip.afrihost.co.za)
[08:18:28] <FunkyBob> so... do  you have an existing view to edit those items?
[08:19:08] <wallbroken> https://github.com/ClaudioViti/lookbook/blob/multi-user-registration/shoes/views.py#L275
[08:19:18] <FunkyBob> a "yes' or "no" will do
[08:19:24] <wallbroken> yes
[08:19:43] <FunkyBob> ok, but there's nothing in that view to limit who can edit it, so lng as they're logged in
[08:20:17] <wallbroken> exactly
[08:20:23] <wallbroken> because that view is used by admin
[08:20:33] *** Joins: bitdex (~bitdex@gateway/tor-sasl/bitdex)
[08:20:38] <wallbroken> who, by definition, can act anything
[08:20:40] <FunkyBob> so you're only limiting it now by not telling people it exists
[08:20:48] <FunkyBob> bsically
[08:20:55] <FunkyBob> basically
[08:21:19] <FunkyBob> you hide the link behind {% if user.is_admin %}
[08:21:34] <wallbroken> yes
[08:22:17] <FunkyBob> you don't need a new view, but I'd make sure that view limits who can use it.
[08:22:41] <FunkyBob> and the most common way is to limit which Shoe records the get_object_or_404 can select
[08:22:54] <FunkyBob> this would be a simple change if it weren't for the is_admin override
[08:23:10] <FunkyBob> it's only a little more complex because of that
[08:23:34] <FunkyBob> if it were only for "Shoes owned by t he user" you could use get_object_or_404(Shoe, user=request.user, pk=pk)
[08:24:57] <wallbroken> FunkyBob: a specific requirement:
[08:25:15] <wallbroken> the basic user's page itself must not show edit/delete/add buttons
[08:25:28] <wallbroken> it must just show "enter management mode" button
[08:25:46] <wallbroken> and in that, i should see all of those buttons
[08:25:57] <wallbroken> and obviously, only the items that can be managed
[08:26:28] <wallbroken> and the manageable items are those who are exclusively bounded to the current user
[08:26:50] <wallbroken> so, i guess i need a new url
[08:26:59] <wallbroken> which is pointing to a new view
[08:27:21] <wallbroken> which basically must be the same as the ShoeList view but with some user filtering
[08:27:30] <wallbroken> do you agree with me?
[08:27:44] <FunkyBob> it would be easier to manage if "management" views were separate from other views,
[08:28:11] <wallbroken> but i need a different item filtering
[08:28:31] <wallbroken> in the management view i should filter items by user
[08:28:39] <FunkyBob> unless they're a super user
[08:28:53] <wallbroken> yes, but in that case, the actual setup is fine
[08:29:07] <FunkyBob> so back to hte view we were discussing
[08:29:21] <FunkyBob> it helps if you know that get_object_or_404 can accept a queryset, not just a model, as the first argument
[08:29:54] <FunkyBob> so you can default to the full set of shoes, and if not user.is_admin:  filter the set for that user only... then pass the queryset to get_object_or_404
[08:30:11] <wallbroken> no
[08:30:16] <FunkyBob> no?
[08:30:25] <FunkyBob> you rally can
[08:30:29] <FunkyBob> really can, even
[08:31:05] <wallbroken> well, remember i said that an user can see in the normal mode also items shared with some other users?
[08:31:18] <FunkyBob> yes?
[08:31:42] <wallbroken> ONLY in "manage mode" we must show only the exclusive owned object
[08:31:55] <wallbroken> because they are only the items the user can manage
[08:32:10] <FunkyBob> ok. doesn't change what I'm saying about the edit view
[08:32:20] <FunkyBob> sounds more like an issue for the list view
[08:33:00] <wallbroken> so you want to change the edit view in order to filter the owned items?
[08:33:17] <FunkyBob> I'm saying you should make the edit view restrict who can edit what.
[08:33:19] <FunkyBob> currently you don't
[08:33:46] <wallbroken> but i also have the admin user
[08:33:51] <FunkyBob> currently if I know the shoe pk (which I can read from the URL) ... I can edit it, so long as I'm logged in
[08:33:55] <FunkyBob> yes, you mentioned that
[08:33:56] <wallbroken> who can edit anything he want
[08:33:59] <FunkyBob> yes
[08:34:05] <FunkyBob> and I'm trying to explain how to handle that
[08:34:10] <FunkyBob> once again it seems you're not reading what I say
[08:34:47] <wallbroken> remember that i need to act on 3 views
[08:34:50] <wallbroken> add, edit, remove
[08:35:01] <FunkyBob> yes, but for now I'm trying to focus only on one of them
[08:35:27] <FunkyBob> it doesn't matter how any of the others work... if I can just plug in the URL for the edit page and it will let me

[08:36:30] <FunkyBob> there's an anti-pattern called "security through obscurity"
[08:36:46] <FunkyBob> you're pretending your system is secure just because you don't show a link to the edit page
[08:37:11] <FunkyBob> right... that's the version I said you could use IFF you didn't need the is-admin override
[08:37:30] <wallbroken> 6:06:30 AM - FunkyBob: there's an anti-pattern called "security through obscurity"
[08:37:30] <wallbroken> 6:06:46 AM - FunkyBob: you're pretending your system is secure just because you don't show a link to the edit page
[08:37:37] <wallbroken> i was thinking about this problem some time ago
[08:37:40] <FunkyBob> I then went on to explain how you could change it to support admin
[08:37:50] <wallbroken> but it's the best i can reach using my knowledge
[08:37:51] <wallbroken> sorry
[08:38:04] <FunkyBob> I'm trying to expand your knowlege
[08:38:12] <FunkyBob> but it's tough going, because you seem to ignore most of what I say
[08:39:09] <wallbroken> well, sometimes things makes hard, and i need to apply more effort
[08:39:22] <FunkyBob> or ask more questions
[08:39:24] <wallbroken> well, that's the only change i need in edit_shoe view?
[08:40:05] <FunkyBob> 03:17 < FunkyBob> it helps if you know that get_object_or_404 can accept a queryset, not just a model, as the first argument
[08:40:08] <FunkyBob> 03:17 < FunkyBob> so you can default to the full set of shoes, and if not user.is_admin:  filter the set for that user only... then pass the queryset to get_object_or_404
[08:43:51] <wallbroken> yes but i cannot add is_admin in the view
[08:44:02] <FunkyBob> add it?
[08:44:12] <FunkyBob> it's a property of the user
[08:44:19] <wallbroken> generally i used it in the template
[08:44:22] <FunkyBob> which is passed to you on the request object
[08:44:25] <wallbroken> to hide parts/buttons
[08:44:30] <FunkyBob> we're not talking about buttons
[08:44:38] <FunkyBob> we're talking about rejecting access to the view entirely
[08:45:13] <wallbroken> ok, i did get what your idea is
[08:45:36] <wallbroken> well, let me try to implement
[08:45:43] <wallbroken> now we have shoe = get_object_or_404(Shoe, user=request.user, pk=pk)
[08:45:49] <wallbroken> the first argument is the model
[08:45:53] <FunkyBob> correct
[08:46:04] <wallbroken> you just tld that it cann accept a queryset instead of model
[08:46:09] <FunkyBob> but when user.is_admin ... you don't want to apply the user=request.user filtering
[08:46:14] <FunkyBob> yes, I did
[08:46:39] <wallbroken> so i can make somethin like:
[08:46:47] <wallbroken> if user.is_admin
[08:47:05] <wallbroken>     parameter = queryset(...)
[08:47:21] <wallbroken> shoe = get_object_or_404(parameter, user=request.user, pk=pk)
[08:47:35] <wallbroken> else
[08:47:43] <wallbroken>     parameter = Shoe
[08:47:53] <wallbroken> do you think it would make sense?
[08:47:56] <FunkyBob> close
[08:48:23] <FunkyBob> as I described above, I would start with the whole set, and if the user is _not_ admin then filter by user
[08:48:24] <wallbroken> the else part is before the get_object statement obviously
[08:49:02] <wallbroken> "the whole set" ?
[08:49:03] <FunkyBob> so... queryset = Shoe.objects.all() ;  if not request.user.is_admin: queryset = queryset.filter(user=request.user)

[10:54:15] <dodobrain> ah i almost forgot what i wanted to ask
[10:54:18] <FunkyBob> ok
[10:55:14] <dodobrain> does django allow forms to be created to represent an object and its foreignkey relational objects ?
[10:55:14] <bin4ry> Oh god.. its selenium version problem all along
[10:55:54] <dodobrain> i.e. single to ask/edit the author details and also book details at the same time
[10:56:10] <dodobrain> bin4ry, are you sure it wasnt the webdriver version?
[10:56:46] <bin4ry> dodobrain: I bumped selenium from 3.140 to 3.141 now the driver can close properly..
[10:56:57] <bin4ry> Can't believe I spent 10 hrs in this
[10:57:33] <FunkyBob> mihael: it really depends on why it's giving a 400.. perhaps check in the s3 console to see if it's publicly accessible
[10:58:22] <dodobrain> FunkyBob, for the purposes of this question lets assume that every book can have only 1 author. so my question is then this: if i end up "deleting"/"removing" a book from the form/frontend, whats the best way to process it on the view ?
[11:01:17] <FunkyBob> not sure I understand

[11:10:41] <dodobrain> yeah i'm prolly trying to confuse myself while trying to confuse you guys :)
[11:11:49] <dodobrain> anyway, the idea is that those Books (Book1, Book2, etc.) could be real django models or virtual properties with a schema defined on the backend and delivered with the form

[11:14:25] <dodobrain> and the current backend view when it receives the form result thats been annotated with which subforms are newly added and which subforms have been deleted is going through a hairy processor that adds/deletes the model backed properties and any non-model backed properties are saved (or edited due  to deletion) as json blobs

[11:17:59] <dodobrain_> im trying to find a good example here.. maybe Book is a django model with name and yearpublished fields. and Author is a django model with name, books (via fk) and a jsonfield called `otherprops`

[13:31:16] <FunkyBob> you mean the total price?

[13:32:15] <teut> can you see my google group post?
[13:32:18] <FunkyBob> even better, if you add total_price as a @cached_property it can be set by the query, or calculated on the fly
[13:32:34] <teut> that is something what I wanted

[13:33:33] <teut> hard coding the formula
[13:33:50] <FunkyBob> yes, well, the formula is hard coded in  your get_total_price method too

[13:35:38] <FunkyBob> https://dpaste.org/EVk5
[13:35:47] <FunkyBob> it's from django.utils.functional iirc
[13:35:53] <FunkyBob> though python has its own version now, too

[13:36:44] <FunkyBob> but like a regular attribute it can also bet set

[13:37:06] <FunkyBob> but if it did... it could be a big win
[13:37:11] <teut> yes
[13:37:21] <teut> if the formula was complicated

[13:42:43] <teut> quite strange FunkyBob I could only search it in blogs
[13:43:14] <teut> ok, but if the formula is bigger than it could be useful
[13:43:26] <teut> and there will be millions of rows
[13:43:33] <teut> billions rather
[13:43:49] <Kim^J> You won't render millions nor billions of rows.
