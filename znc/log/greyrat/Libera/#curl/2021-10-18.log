[16:25:59] <bagder> TCP windowing is not voluntary though, and since we talked http I think we can assume that TCP is used =)

[18:08:25] <bagder> they parties just settled in the trial I was gonna be an expert witness in, so now I don't have to do it
[18:08:50] <jfuller> bagder:  was it dns or bgp ?
[18:08:56] <icing> meh!
[18:09:02] <jfuller> the murder weapon that is
[18:09:16] <bagder> it was very curl like =)
[18:10:11] <bagder> the defendants scraped a major Swedish realtor site and used their contents much in a way google or a search engine does
[18:10:32] <icing> he decoded the HTML?
[18:10:38] <bagder> pretty much
[18:11:03] <icing> I thought it is encrypted securely in https:
[18:12:38] * bagder runs off
[18:12:52] <jfuller> top secret security
[18:16:13] <Piru> if you don't read the html you're fine
[18:16:35] <Piru> it's not hacking then
[18:17:31] <jfuller> yes, all you have to do is write a general parser for 'in the wild' html ... not a trivial task
[18:17:35] <jfuller> good security
