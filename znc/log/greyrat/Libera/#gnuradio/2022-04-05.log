[02:09:02] <duude__> Hey people
[02:10:34] <duude__> I started reading the wiki and following youtube lessons and I can't figure out what's causing this, it's originating from the fm modulator. Perhaps you guys have an idea https://i.imgur.com/jkwsc7L.png
[02:11:06] <duude__> See the spikes on the sides? No idea what's causing them
[02:11:10] <duude__> Every idea I had to remove them, failed
[02:11:52] <duude__> Plus the signal looks too large as well
[02:12:00] <duude__> And it looks kind of weird.. No idea :D
[02:26:53] *** Joins: hololeap (~hololeap@user/hololeap)

[02:39:20] <muaddib[m]> Your screenshot is blurry, I can’t see the parameters but it looks like your low pass is interpolating by 2 and your rational resampler is decimating by 2 ??
[02:42:06] *** Quits: nsk_nyc (~nsk_nyc@network45-238-142-host-234.inethn.net) (Quit: My MacBook has gone to sleep. ZZZzzz…)
[02:47:34] <duude__> muaddib: Nope, low pass filter is just adding a bit of gain and I included it to try and keep the FM from spiraling too out of control but it didn't help

[02:53:35] <muaddib[m]> Can you post another screenshot where are the parameters are clear?
[02:53:35] <muaddib[m]> It looks like you have a bandwidth set to 1 MHz, but your sampling rate is 44.1 kHz right?
[02:55:37] <patchvonbraun[m]> Also, TWO throttles?    That's gonna be yucky
[02:56:03] <muaddib[m]> Whoa, I didn’t even see that
[02:56:34] <patchvonbraun[m]> That speaks to a deep misunderstanding about how sample-rate conversion happens, and exactly what a throttle is.
[02:58:05] *** Quits: hololeap_ (~hololeap@user/hololeap) (Remote host closed the connection)
[02:59:24] *** Joins: hololeap_ (~hololeap@user/hololeap)
[03:06:49] <subspace1486[m]> I'm not OP, but sample-rate conversions are just decimation or interpolation, right? Grabbing samples in a specific interval or expanding them by inserting duplicates. The throttle block slows the speed of the data to a specific samples-per-second rate. Do I have that about right? still learning
[03:07:11] <patchvonbraun[m]> subspace1486: Yes.
[03:07:29] <patchvonbraun[m]> Although sample-rate conversion that largely preserve the spectral integrity require filtering in addition...
[03:07:48] <subspace1486[m]> I don't know what spectral integrity means here
[03:08:50] <duude__> muaddib, patchvonbraun: Hey people, here's a higher res picture https://i.imgur.com/ua6husA.png
[03:09:01] <subspace1486[m]> also, are there libraries for GNU Radio, say modulators and demodulators for different types of signals or some other type of meta-block that does multiple things at once?
[03:09:06] <duude__> Sorry for using two throttle blocks, from what I've seen cpu-cycles wise, it didn't impact the computer at all
[03:09:36] <duude__> Plus the lesson I went over mentioned that it's better to use it than not when you're unsure if samples were being limited, such as with signal sources and modulations
[03:10:08] <duude__> muaddib: 44.1kHz as per my wavfile is, yes then that gets upsamples
[03:10:10] <duude__> upsampled*
[03:10:17] <patchvonbraun[m]> Which is why things like the freq_xlating filter take a decimation parameter--they are a "fused" block.  I mean you *could* use a non-decimating filter followed by a keep-one-in-N but that's inefficient.
[03:11:40] <patchvonbraun[m]> duude__: Throttle is purely for simulations and reading from files when you want the simulation run in somewhere close to "real time".  Gnu Radio has no inherent concept of sample rate.  It processes streams of samples.  An actual clock-time sample rate is an artifice imposed either by hardware on the edge, or with a throttle.
[03:12:37] <patchvonbraun[m]> subspace1486: If you simply decimate a signal that is Nyquist sampled at X, and then simply decimate it by some factor, there'll be aliases unless you filter it first.
[03:13:09] <muaddib[m]> duude__: That tutorial is complete BS. That’s not good advice at all.
[03:13:39] <muaddib[m]> If that’s on the wiki, please post a link So I can change it,because that’s not how this works.
[03:14:37] <patchvonbraun[m]> When a filter needs a sample rate, it's just so that it can do the normalization math. If the samples aren't arriving at the fitler at that rate, then the math will be wrong.  Like any computer-languagey-thingy it can't "figure out what you meant".
[03:16:37] <patchvonbraun[m]> OR lets say an FM demodulator wants to know the input sample rate.  That's just for parameter setting.  It doesn't force the incoming sample-stream to that rate.  You have to not lie to it, or the demod parameters wont work out right.
[03:17:14] <duude__> I understand, but what I observe upon removing throttle blocks is a 70% increase in CPU cyle time
[03:17:38] <duude__> I'm not sure exactly what's going in background, I'm sorry, I'll try to learn better
[03:17:47] <duude__> The course is Ossman's introduction to GNUradio
[03:18:13] <duude__> I paired that with frequency googling, stackoverflow, wiki and just.. experimenting
[03:18:23] <duude__> Do you guys have a better source or a book or something to reccomend? :)

[03:25:18] <muaddib[m]> https://wiki.gnuradio.org/index.php?title=Tutorials
[03:25:18] <muaddib[m]> And to increase your basic fundamental knowledge, go through these as well.

[03:27:39] <muaddib[m]> You’re welcome. 
[03:27:39] <muaddib[m]> The first will give you exercises on how to use GNURadio and some fundamentals of DSP. 
[03:27:39] <muaddib[m]> The second is primarily fundamental, with practical applications in python.

[05:19:30] <patchvonbraun[m]> duude__: Ossmann's tutorials are VERY dated now.  Some of them are just plain *wrong* even at the time he produced them.  General DSP knowledge--www.dsprelated.com   www.complextoreal.com, also Richard Lyons book "Understanding DIgital Signal Processing".   Others:  https://www.dsprelated.com/showarticle/56.php
[05:21:52] <patchvonbraun[m]> It is unfortunately the case that the GR project has spawned a LOT of 3rd-party tutorial stuff that is either obsolete, or "born incorrect".   There's not a whole lot we can do about that, other than refer to the "good stuff".
[05:22:44] <muaddib[m]> “Born incorrect” :)
[05:28:55] <patchvonbraun[m]> The problem is, like most programming environments, you can do thing "wrong" and still achieve some positive-ish results.  You then, buoyed by the notion that you "really get this stuff" start producing tutorials.  It turns into a "blind leading the blind" kind of thing.
[05:35:45] <patchvonbraun[m]> In other news, I slewed our Rideau Ferry movable dish to make daily observations of SGR J1935+2154, which is the SGR that STARE2 detected, and is now confirmed to be a repeater not just in Gamma, but also in radio!
[05:36:40] <patchvonbraun[m]> The 14m dish at Carp will also be making daily observations of this target, since the main, block-hole-merger target is only about 1deg away, and we will use a lower-frequency feed for the FRB detections, thus giving us a larger beam.

[13:33:11] <drmpeg> It doesn't sound very good here.
[13:34:39] <drmpeg> When I see those "ears" in the spectrum, the audio sounds distorted.
[13:38:44] <drmpeg> It looks like a full scale audio signal from the WAV file overdrives the WBFM block.
[13:39:33] <drmpeg> If you scale down the audio level, it sounds a lot better and the "ears" are not as prominent.

[21:06:17] <muaddib[m]> Going through the PDU examples. They are great. Thanks Jacob... (full message at https://libera.ems.host/_matrix/media/r0/download/libera.chat/9e16ef679b4ce21d891400c0075b501b950f2b82)
[21:10:32] <Jacob[m]> ctrlport or xmlrpc would be the conventional ways to do this
[21:11:03] <Jacob[m]> you can use async message passing but i dont think there is a way for messages to update top level variables

[21:12:28] <muaddib[m]> agreed
[21:12:32] <muaddib[m]> re: xmlrpc
[21:12:39] <muaddib[m]> wait...i think i got it
[21:12:47] <muaddib[m]> This may have been one of those things that I knew i needed to ask and then i'd figure it out.

[21:13:33] <muaddib[m]> this seems to work
[21:13:58] <muaddib[m]> i'm changing the slider in the first flowgraph and the label is updating in the second
[21:14:21] <muaddib[m]> need to see if it works with non-qt control

[21:32:31] <muaddib[m]> I think this is similar to gr-control. 
[21:32:31] <muaddib[m]> Each flowgraph has to have an initial value set. An xmlrpc ‘get’ would be better to set initial conditions but you get into some chicken and egg with having a server to post to in one graph but the same graph is a client to the sender. 
[21:32:31] <muaddib[m]> I’ve got it on my list to add some of these features to XMLRPC
