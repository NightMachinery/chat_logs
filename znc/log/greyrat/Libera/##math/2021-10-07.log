[03:46:55] <isekaijin> A bilinear map is always of the form U x V -> W, where U, V, W are vector spaces.
[03:47:03] <isekaijin> But the unit circle is not a vector space over any field.
[03:47:24] *** Joins: Nickssen (~Nickssen@pc-25-120-47-190.cm.vtr.net)
[03:48:26] <isekaijin> Mmm, wait. Maybe you just want a Z-bilinear map. The unit circle is an Abelian group.
[03:48:45] <Nickssen> I am given the following PDE and I am asked to solve in a neighbourhood of (x,y) = (0,0): 2x u_xx + 2u_xx - 8u_xy  = u_y   / sqrt(|4-x|)
[03:49:29] <Nickssen> What does it mean to solve in a neighbourhood of (0,0)? Does it simplify anything?  the BC are u(0,y) = 0, u_x (0,y) = 1
[03:50:52] <isekaijin> It means that your solution must be a function defined in a neighborhood of (0,0).
[03:51:12] <isekaijin> I do not remember much from PDE class, but you had to first check whether the equation is hyperbolic, parabolic or elliptic.
[03:52:17] <isekaijin> Then you had to find a suitable change of coordinates (i.e., a diffeomorphism between neighborhoods of (0,0)) that reduces the PDE to a simpler case that depends on previously identified type.
[03:53:03] <Nickssen> right the eta zeta thingy
[03:53:15] <Nickssen> and finding a valid jacobian and all that right>?
[03:53:15] <isekaijin> Yup!
[03:53:46] <isekaijin> So it seems that your professor or book even uses the same notation that we used.
[03:53:58] <Nickssen> because then he says *explain* how to find the solution at  (5,5).
[03:54:21] <Nickssen> heh the eta zeta will live in my  mind forever

[04:47:49] <Nickssen> the case you submitted is a complex roots case because you have a cosine with an exponential
[04:48:22] <Nickssen> the exponential comes with the real part of  root, the argument of the sine/cosine comes from the imaginary part of the root
[04:48:48] <Nickssen> now, because you say the solution is:  y = -7e^(5x)*x*cos(x)   and the  equation has to be 4th order
[04:48:48] <constxd> ok wait
[04:49:07] <Nickssen> the extra "x" comes from repeated roots

[05:00:17] <constxd> right
[05:00:54] <constxd> so what do i do from there
[05:01:35] <Nickssen> expand the parentheses (D^2 - m)^2 where m is your complex root
[05:01:43] <constxd> none of the cases in the table have both the "x" factor and the cosine
[05:02:01] <Nickssen> yeah because the table is for 2nd order
[05:02:15] <constxd> right
[05:02:31] <Nickssen> but since your solution is a cosine
[05:02:55] <constxd> that's how i know the roots are complex?
[05:03:34] <Nickssen> yeah. the solution y = e^ax cos(bx) is due to complex roots, just like y = e^ax sin(bx)
[05:03:39] <Nickssen> (they come together)
[05:04:38] <Nickssen> but your solution has an extra "x" , its of the form xe^ax cos(bx), with  complex root equal to m = a+bi,  of *multiplicity two (its repeated)*
[05:05:10] <Nickssen> so now you know your equation must be of the form [(D^2 - m)^2]y = 0

[09:28:31] <qergle> so weil was not immune
[09:28:43] <Fangs> lets denote [1,n] = {1,...,n}, the set of possible maps [1,n] -> [1,n] is .. n^n.. the set of all possible nxn multiplication table would be n^3, and then given two valid tables, you check all the possible maps between them and see if any is a group isomorphism.. so n^3 * n^n * {idk whats the bound here}
[09:28:47] <Fangs> so thats the upperbound I think?
[09:29:45] <twJizhan> but can "associativity" of a algorithmically/program generated nxn multiplication table be decided also algorithmically / by program ?

[09:30:52] <isekaijin> qergle: Maybe he did not meant to identify isomorphic ones?
[09:30:54] <Fangs> the table encodes a function f:[1,n] x [1,n] -> [1,n]
[09:31:08] <Fangs> associativity follows associativity of function composition
[09:31:11] <Fangs> theres nothing to chekc
[09:31:15] <Me-me> (*programmatically)
[09:31:38] <cherim> "Nothing to check" is better expressed as "finite number of equalities to check"

[09:31:56] <cherim> Otherwise algorithmists may be shocked by his equivalence
[09:32:07] <isekaijin> qergle: Yeah. It can happen even to the smartest people.
[09:32:32] <cherim> In January this year Zeilberger asked at his seminar if a character of a finite group can ever take non-real values

[09:36:31] <cherim> Milne in his first edition of "group theory" argued "the multiplication table is nxn, each entry takes values in 1..n, so there are at most n^3 groups of order n"

[09:41:11] <Fangs> cherim: nothing sophisticated, just to continue that bound for the naive strategy of checking n^n possible maps from [1,n] to [1,n]
[09:41:50] <Fangs> twJizhan: things can be algorithmically computable and still be NP hard
[09:42:07] <Fangs> 3-sat has an algorithm to solve but still be NP complete
[09:42:26] <cherim> Associativity is checking n^3 equalities per table, nothing deep
[09:42:54] <cherim> But figuring out isomorphisms takes a lot
[09:43:35] <twJizhan> :o
[09:43:45] <Fangs> twJizhan: idk if experts would agree, but it might be relevant to know that group presentation is known to be unsolvable
[09:44:16] <Fangs> so a group is often given as a 'presentation': <generators | relations, stuff that equalt to 1>
[09:44:43] <Fangs> whether two presentation gives an isomorphic group is unsolvable iirc, so group isomoprhism is hard in general
[09:45:04] <cherim> Not for finite groups though

[18:08:25] <Hazey_Dream> What do you mean by how is EXP calculated? I did do a system earlier, where basically the EXP to reach a level is equal to the total EXP to reach the previous levels, plus that level's value. Shown in this Pastebin: https://pastebin.com/Acge4BUH
[18:08:38] <[itchyjunk]> i think right, it makes enough sense
[18:09:03] <dila> [itchyjunk]: if g(x)=-x and f(x)=e^x, then f(g(x))=e^-x

[18:17:59] <[itchyjunk]> f'(z) = (-e^(-theta)/r) (sin(ln(r)) - i cos(ln(r))) is fine as well
[18:18:12] <[itchyjunk]> i also understand why r > 0 is given
[18:18:26] <[itchyjunk]> but i don't understand what the 0 < theta < 2pi
[18:18:31] <Hazey_Dream> In the context of the nonexistent hypothetical system this system to determine amount of EXP to level up, EXP is Experience Points, which would in theory be accumulated via unspecified means. Acquire a total amoubt of EXP (Experience Points) equal to or greater than the requirement for a Level of a given value, & you become the highest of those levels you're elligible for.
[18:19:12] <Hazey_Dream> Otherwise, EXP is not based on anything, because this is just an isolated system of determining how much EXP (Theoretically) would be required to reach what level(s).
[18:19:20] <dila> Hazey_Dream: but when those means are specified, then EXP is a function of some variables
[18:19:50] <Hazey_Dream> Yes, but I don't see the relevance of those variables, given they don't exist & aren't necessary to determine this part of the system
[18:19:51] <dila> maybe you gain EXP over time without any action? in that case EXP is a function of time
[18:20:56] <Hazey_Dream> We'll say for now, EXP cannot be gained, but what amounts of it are required to become what level still need to be set.
[18:21:48] <dila> but if you can gain a level, then you can gain EXP?
[18:22:11] <[itchyjunk]> What is the question even?
[18:22:48] <dila> i assume he's trying to balance some kind of reward in a game
[18:23:06] <Hazey_Dream> No such game exists
[18:23:20] <Hazey_Dream> (10:34:27)<Hazey_Dream>In "level(n) = n + sum of level(k) for k from 1 to n-1", how & where would you define the variables?
[18:23:20] <Hazey_Dream> (10:34:49)<Hazey_Dream>After all, WHEN a formula like that is to be used, the level & sum of levels should be known, right?
[18:23:25] <Hazey_Dream> That is the question
[18:25:01] *** Joins: vqueiroz (uid340368@id-340368.hampstead.irccloud.com)
[18:25:04] <Hazey_Dream> A human can use that formula, & I assume some kinds of machine can, too, but certainly not all of them. If you show it to say, WolframAlpha : https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=level%28n%29+%3D+n+%2B+sum+of+level%28k%29+for+k+from+1+to+n-1
[18:25:04] <[itchyjunk]> level(k) is some function that defined how much exp you need to get a level posisbly
[18:25:13] <[itchyjunk]> level(n) = n^2
[18:25:50] <[itchyjunk]> level(1) = 1, level(2) = 4 etc
[18:26:36] <[itchyjunk]> or level(1) = 1, level(n) = level(n-1) + 1
[18:26:48] <[itchyjunk]> so you can compute that also
[18:27:02] <Hazey_Dream> (10:55:11)<[itchyjunk]>level(k) is some function that defined how much exp you need to get a level posisbly
[18:27:09] <int-e> Hazey_Dream: You wrote a lot, but it seems your answer is simply  level(n) = 2^(n+1) - 1?
[18:28:02] <dila> one problem is, if you want to award +1 EXP, it's possible that when mapped back to game state you end up with a delta that violates a condition such as "game time is monotonic"
[18:28:21] <[itchyjunk]> its a hypothetical game anyways
[18:28:24] <[itchyjunk]> so wouldn't matter
[18:28:39] <int-e> it's fairly common to make these things exponential, but not with base 2
[18:28:49] <dila> i would make the mapping linear
[18:29:25] <Hazey_Dream> Thank you, int-e.
[18:30:44] <dila> in a complicated game though, two players could have equal EXP but diffferent player state (e.g. they posess different items)
[18:31:46] <dila> EXP(player1) = EXP(player2) => EXP(player1-player2) = 0. if you make the mapping linear, then such nice properties hold.
[18:32:14] <Hazey_Dream> In theory, yes, & that is nice information.
[18:32:16] <Oli> How about awarding:  experience_source_base_experience * (float(experience_source_level / character level))?
[18:32:26] <dila> or just make it up..
[18:33:23] <Hazey_Dream> If I ever get the resources, skill, knowledge & ambition, I'll consider it, but thank you.
[18:33:36] <dila> EXP(player1) + 1 = EXP(player1 + EXP^-1(1))

[18:37:48] <int-e> Throwing formulas around isn't doing anything here. you need to come up with requirements... like expected time required to reach a particular level, whether XP rewards are fixed or scaled with player level, where those rewards come from (maybe they're all one-time only which would make a linear progression much easier)... a lot of things that all fall under "game design" rather than math. Once you...
[18:37:54] <int-e> ...have those requirements fixed *then* you can start talking about formulas that satisfy them. Or make up tables instead... the number of values is often small enough for that to be both feasible and reasonable.

[20:12:52] <isekaijin> So we have every possible positive integer as a Milnor number of an A_n singularity.
[20:13:08] <sek> the first thing that comes to mind is to use the dual graph of the exceptional divisor of the resolution of singularities. These are definitely different for the different du val sings
[20:13:57] <sek> but probably that's overkill again
[20:17:36] <isekaijin> If I could prove this fact, then everything would be solved. Let V \subset C^n be an affine variety, and let J \subset C[x1,...,xn] be its Jacobian ideal. Then the isomorphism type of C[x1,...,xn] / J is an intrinsic invariant of V, i.e., does not depend on the embedding into C^n.

[23:09:13] <joel135> between substitutions, i don't have a good general example on my mind, but if you compose a substitution functor with the corresponding universal quantifier so that you get an endofunctor, then the co/unit is a morphism between this composite and id

[23:55:19] <sek> I should add that even in geometry/topology we avoid dealing with presheaves by sheafifying, they are not just some unecessary abstraction, they are absolutely integral to very geometric constructions - eg the image presheaf of f:F->G a morphism is not a sheaf, and same for the tensor product, the the construction of an image/tensor "sheaf" is rather involved

[23:56:45] <mornfall> i don't even understand what (pre)sheaves actually are; i do have some grasp on fiber bundles
[23:57:03] <mornfall> they tend to be described as ‘stuff attached to points of a space’
[23:57:13] <mornfall> presumably with some smoothness of variation condition? dunno
[23:57:16] <joel135> PSh(PSh(C)) has a formal interest, because PSh is sort of like a multiset monad. You know, multiset(multiset(X)) -> multiset(X) given by taking unions/sums.
[23:57:48] <sek> mornfall: basically yeah, that's the main example of a sheaf - the sheaf of sections of something that looks like a fibre bundle
[23:58:27] <mornfall> (i mean, that's what sheaves are described as)
[23:58:48] <sek> the nicest fibre bundles are vector bundles, and a vb is exactly the data of what's called a locally free sheaf, namely the sheaf of sections to the vb
[23:59:50] <sek> of course the definition of a presheaf is simpler than all this, but I believe this came after people noticed this correspondence with vector bundles
