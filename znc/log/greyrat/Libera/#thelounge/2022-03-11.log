[21:19:05] <kinghat> in regards to: https://github.com/thelounge/thelounge/issues/4511 maybe github discussions should be opened up on the repos so help is less ephemeral 🤔
[21:23:17] <bookworm> looking at how often people search open/closed issues the answer to that is no
[21:23:31] <bookworm> they aren't looking at historical content as is
[21:25:15] <bookworm> and that particular person just wants people to thumbs up their pet project 
[21:25:18] <kinghat> could just bot them a link to the discussion forum. also you dont have to setup forum software. just "enable."
[21:25:42] <bookworm> sure, but then you need to follow and moderate it
[21:26:08] <bookworm> and for me the drawbacks exceed any benefit we'd get

[22:29:12] <bookworm> that's the point isn't it?
[22:29:46] <bookworm> if you get the same requests time and time again then your docs are shit and you need to improve them
[22:30:09] <bookworm> then eventually you have perfect docs and the chan will be mostly free of support requests
[22:30:24] <bookworm> (in an ideal world)
[22:31:48] <bookworm> and this chan has few enough messages that all maintainers which are active at least passingly read it, judging by the conversations
[22:32:50] <bookworm> so we don't have the problem that things don't get noticed by the people who should notice it. It's not like #linux where you don't pay attention for an hour or two and you have 2k messages unread

[23:03:58] <spotUP> Hiw do i get it up in the repos?

[23:04:03] <spotUP> *how
[23:04:25] <spotUP> I have never used npm
[23:04:28] <bookworm> so... did you make an account? Looked at the upload docs of either yarn or npm?
[23:04:42] <bookworm> because you need to do your homework 
[23:04:46] <spotUP> No. Indidn’t know where to look
[23:04:55] <spotUP> This is all new to me
[23:05:29] <JohnComputation> was it "node-sqlite3" or just "sqlite3" on yarn? I can't remember. Dealt with this problem before.
[23:06:07] <spotUP> Bookworm: i’m cool with homework
[23:06:17] <bookworm> spotUP: https://docs.npmjs.com/packages-and-modules/contributing-packages-to-the-registry
[23:06:19] <spotUP> I just need some pointers in the right direction
[23:06:23] <bookworm> read all relevant pages
[23:06:30] <spotUP> Will do!
[23:06:35] <spotUP> Thanks a lot!
[23:07:51] <bookworm> JohnComputation: yarn install on its own should work, but I'd just nuke the node_modules folder prior to retrying. npm / yarn can be a bit peculiar 
[23:08:23] <spotUP> So.. should my theme be a scoped release? Tied to the lounge?
[23:08:32] <bookworm> the package is just named sqlite, but if you build the latest master you need to make sure to grab the specific version that TL expects
[23:09:04] <bookworm> spotUP: to your own user account and scopes are probably not worth it unless you have tons of packages
[23:09:19] <spotUP> Ok so uns oped
[23:09:27] * spotUP continues reading
[23:09:32] <bookworm> you can't add packages to the thelounge org for obvious reasons... you aren't part of it

[23:09:44] <JohnComputation> " ...
[23:09:47] <bookworm> the way themes etc are found by users is via tags

[23:11:58] <JohnComputation> bookworm, it's "/etc/thelounge/packages/node_modules" correct?
[23:12:13] <spotUP> Bookworm: ok
[23:12:40] <spotUP> Is anyone else having problems specifying a default theme in the conf file?
[23:12:49] <bookworm> JohnComputation: don't run yarn or npm as root!
[23:12:55] <bookworm> never, ever
[23:12:59] <JohnComputation> nope, I won't
[23:13:13] <bookworm> if you went the packaging route just reinstall the package
[23:13:24] <bookworm> which distro are you on?
[23:13:31] <JohnComputation> sets permissions to the wrong user (root)
[23:13:36] <spotUP> Uhm. Noob question: what can happen if you do that as root?
[23:13:45] <JohnComputation> Raspbian (Debian, right?)
[23:13:52] <bookworm> kinghat: Max / john took care of it, I'm not a frontend person 
[23:14:08] <bookworm> you fuck up your system, properly 
[23:14:21] <spotUP> Hmm
[23:14:22] <bookworm> yeah, debian derivative 
[23:14:24] <spotUP> :)
[23:15:07] <JohnComputation> or is it Raspberry Pi OS now..? whatever
[23:15:14] <spotUP> Hmm i guess i have to redo my docker image then
[23:15:17] <bookworm> I know what you mean
[23:15:17] <JohnComputation> usually I just run... "sudo apt install ./thelounge_4.3.0_all.deb
[23:15:18] <JohnComputation> "
[23:16:16] <JohnComputation> ^ not sure why the quote is on a new message, but ok
[23:17:57] *** Quits: spotUP (~spotUP@c83-248-134-30.bredband.tele2.se) (Remote host closed the connection)
[23:18:11] <bookworm> the way it works for the deb is that a postinstall hook runs yarn for you and tries to fetch sqlite JohnComputation 
[23:18:43] <bookworm> so uninstall/ reinstall might pick it up, but you'll need to install python2 for it to work 
[23:18:51] <bookworm> at least for the current release 
[23:19:11] <bookworm> (there are no prebuilt binary blobs afaik for rpis)
[23:20:02] <bookworm> meaning you need to build from source and with the version of sqlite3 we use in the current release that needs a c compiler (build-essentials) and python2
[23:22:33] <JohnComputation> I think I already have python2, so that should be good there...
[23:22:53] <bookworm> gcc and the likes?
[23:23:01] <JohnComputation> pretty sure
[23:23:03] <JohnComputation> let me see.
[23:23:30] <JohnComputation> gcc is installed
[23:23:37] <bookworm> also, python2 os EOL you need to actively pull it in
[23:23:52] <bookworm> it doesn't come by default any longer 
[23:23:57] <JohnComputation> yeah...
[23:24:15] <JohnComputation> so, I guess time to download the repo then..
[23:24:28] <JohnComputation> er, no.
[23:24:31] <bookworm> no need for the repo, just the deb
[23:24:49] <bookworm> unless you want to build from source on your own
[23:25:07] <JohnComputation> already have the .deb file, which I tried to install from
[23:27:43] *** Joins: Baphomet (~baphomet@user/linguist)
[23:32:04] <JohnComputation> so uninstall? I won't lose any settings right?
[23:35:44] <JohnComputation> oh, no I won't, just need to run "apt remove"
[23:36:46] <bookworm> remove vs purge... the latter cleans up while the former leaves config files intact iirc
[23:37:38] <JohnComputation> yeah
[23:38:20] * bookworm stopped using Ubuntu years ago so don't listen to him if he talks about apt
[23:41:09] <JohnComputation> lol, everything you have said is correct though
[23:41:21] <JohnComputation> I am just kinda remembering it
[23:48:49] <jclsn> Ah nice mobile IRC
[23:49:05] <jclsn> Written from my Pinephone
[23:49:20] <JohnComputation> running the install, and uhh
[23:49:23] <JohnComputation> "info There appears to be trouble with your network connection. Retrying...
[23:49:23] <JohnComputation> "
[23:49:46] <jclsn> Funny that it doesn't work on my iPhone
[23:50:57] <bookworm> it works about as nice as apple wants it to work considering that they force a browser engine 
[23:54:37] <jclsn> I guess
[23:54:51] <jclsn> it says the website is insecure
[23:55:33] <jclsn> The server has SSL. What else do they want?
[23:58:59] <bookworm> hm? That's completely on you as an admin 
[23:59:21] <bookworm> you need to provide a valid TLS cert and then it isn't insecure
