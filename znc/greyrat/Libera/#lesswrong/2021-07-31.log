[01:49:39] <Robomot> Discursive dilemma - Wikipedia (Discursive dilemma or doctrinal paradox is a paradox in social choice theory. The paradox is that aggregating judgments with majority voting can result in self-contradictory judgments. ‚Ä¶)
[01:49:58] <kuudes> hmm, nice, uk has got to 88%/71% in vaccines, and cases are dropping there
[01:50:10] <saturn2> i think that's kind of missing the point
[01:50:38] <Gurkenglas> saturn2, is the point that majority voting does not preserve some kind of equivalence relation? :)
[01:53:14] <saturn2> it's not even really about the voting, any way you try to summarize a group's beliefs will not work
[01:53:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> I mean, you have to pick a decision criterion (a.k.a. an aggregation function)
[01:54:10] <Obormot\Arcturus> That's an actual choice you have to make
[01:54:48] <Obormot\Arcturus> If you ask "does this group think we should build the bridge or does this group think we should NOT build the bridge", the answer is ... mu
[01:54:49] <Gurkenglas> and that aggregation function can have neat properties such as being invariant under rephrasing
[01:54:53] <Obormot\Arcturus> The group does not think anything
[01:55:04] <Obormot\Arcturus> Various members of the group think various things
[01:55:23] <pompolic> spooky egregore noises
[01:55:27] <Gurkenglas> for example, if you throw away *all* the information it's invariant under everything x)
[01:55:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> You just can't convert a vector to a scalar without making an actual choice of function
[01:55:51] <Obormot\Arcturus> There are any number of functions that take a vector and output some scalar
[01:56:13] <Gurkenglas> you don't necessarily convert it to a scalar
[01:56:22] <Obormot\Arcturus> Well, you have to, in this case
[01:56:37] <Gurkenglas> you could convert it to a probability distribution over scalars
[01:56:38] <saturn2> the point is that there is no function where trivial logical consistency will hold
[01:56:44] <Obormot\Arcturus> Because the question "do we build the bridge, yes/no" takes a scalar (specifically, a single bit) as input
[01:57:07] <Obormot\Arcturus> Gurkenglas: That is totally unhelpful
[01:57:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: What do you mean by "trivial logical consistency"?
[01:57:56] <saturn2> as you say, "the group does not think anything," but people really want it to
[01:57:58] <Gurkenglas> i would feel better if some randomness introduced invariance. for example, you could have a random member of the group answer each question. sadly, that's not invariant either.
[01:58:07] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: Want doesn't get, as they say...
[01:59:28] <saturn2> Obormot\Arcturus: like asking A and B separately and doing the & yourself won't give the same answer as asking A&B
[01:59:53] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: If that's so, the WP page certainly neither claims nor shows that
[02:00:16] <Obormot\Arcturus> That sounds like framing effects to me, tbh
[02:00:26] <Gurkenglas> sure does
[02:00:31] <Obormot\Arcturus> Which is a different thing from what that page describes
[02:00:39] <Gurkenglas> (sure does claim that)
[02:00:43] <Obormot\Arcturus> It does not
[02:01:54] <Gurkenglas> if you ask whether the caretaker did mow over the roses majority vote says yes. If you ask whether there was a contract not to mow over the roses it says yes. if you ask whether both were true it says no
[02:01:56] <Gurkenglas> that is their example
[02:02:59] <Obormot\Arcturus> That example is not what saturn2 just described
[02:04:09] <Obormot\Arcturus> This is not a framing effect at all, note
[02:04:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's a substantive disagreement
[02:04:20] <Obormot\Arcturus> Framing this different won't change anything

[02:06:10] <adiabatic> pompolic: re: free energy: are you talking about it in the Inadequate Equilibria sense, or in the Gibbs Free Energy sense?
[02:06:51] <Obormot\Arcturus> Like, note here that the operation of taking "most think X" and "most think Y" and trying to apply AND to them - it doesn't work; AND is not defined on aggregate measures
[02:07:41] <Obormot\Arcturus> So the "paradox" or "dilemma" is because you're trying to do an illegitimate operation (or, correspondingly, we can think of it as "because you're asking two different questions, not just one question two ways")
[02:09:04] <saturn2> people do that illegitimate operation all the time
[02:09:21] <Obormot\Arcturus> People do lots of illegitimate things with numbers and logic etc.
[02:09:28] <saturn2> yes
[02:09:30] <Obormot\Arcturus> I am not sure what the takeaway is supposed to be
[02:09:34] <Obormot\Arcturus> "People are bad at logic"?
[02:09:39] <Obormot\Arcturus> That seems underwhelming
[02:10:55] <saturn2> the takeaway is that groups don't have consistent beliefs
[02:11:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> I would say "groups don't have beliefs, period" (at least not in any strict or formal sense), but, sure, I guess
[02:11:58] <saturn2> (is sci-hub not working?)
[02:12:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> Although there is another thing to note about, at least, the given example
[02:12:56] <saturn2> anyway this is a good paper if it's what i think it is https://www.jstor.org/stable/24704166
[02:12:57] <Robomot> Groupthink on JSTOR (How should a group with different opinions (but the same values) make decisions? In a Bayesian setting, the natural question is how to aggregate credences: how ...)
[02:13:02] <Obormot\Arcturus> And that is ... you can just directly poll people to ask "should we build this bridge or not"
[02:14:22] <Obormot\Arcturus> Like, the problem seems to arise because you're first deciding on a way to extract a decision criterion from specific sub-beliefs, and THEN you're polling people about those sub-beliefs, and THEN you get confused about how to aggregate things
[02:15:30] <Obormot\Arcturus> Similarly, with the judicial decision case ... ask the judges to decide whether the guy is liable. Assuming they're not misapplying the law (and the example stipulates that they are not), that is already sufficient
[02:16:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> In the given example, doing this would yield a decision of "not liable", which seems like exactly the right outcome given the disagreements posited
[02:17:02] <Obormot\Arcturus> I have a suspicion that many cases where such a "dilemma" comes up will turn out to be good old "manipulation of procedural outcomes"
[02:17:28] <saturn2> yes that's another important takeaway
[02:18:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> i.e., "the straightforward way of extracting a decision from the polled population yields an answer we don't like, so let's muddy the waters by inventing various dilemmas of the sort 'if we rejiggered our decision algorithm like *this*, then the answer would change like *that*, isn't that terrible and disturbing??"
[02:18:08] <saturn2> by choosing between different apparently fair mechanisms you can get whatever outcome you want

[09:46:35] * nshepperd2 suddenly realizes why retry_on_oom wasn't working properly
[09:47:44] <nshepperd2> when pytorch throws the out of memory exception, like any python exception, python 'helpfully' attaches to it all of the local variables in every stack frame between where it was thrown and caught
[09:49:36] <nshepperd2> which means when you catch an oom that happens in the middle of .backward(), you get a bunch of random gpu tensors from that calculation that can't be gc'd() using up memory, unless you explicitly delete the exception before retrying
[09:58:22] <otoburb> quanticle: the lower stress is worth it .... until they need more cash again 
[10:09:06] <shawwwn> nshepperd2: but why was the exception staying referenced?
[10:09:57] <nshepperd2> because i was doing the retry in the exception handler
[10:11:25] <nshepperd2> (and also because everything in python stays referenced until you del it or leave the function scope)
[10:12:20] <shawwwn> But you don‚Äôt need to name the exception usually
[10:12:38] <nshepperd2> i wanted to print it out

[10:13:09] <rsaarelm> I'm not sure if you're supposed to be able to read more than a couple paragraphs of the new Zero HPL story without quitting in exhaustion.
[10:13:15] <shawwwn> Yeah it‚Äôs nice
[10:13:59] <shawwwn> But the exception is also stored in sys.exc_info, so maybe you do have to delete it. But if so, deleting your named exception wasn‚Äôt enough either
[10:14:48] <nshepperd2> 'sys.exc_info Return information about the most recent exception caught by an except clause in the current stack frame or in an older stack frame.'
[10:14:59] * nshepperd2 throws her keyboard out the window
[10:16:46] <nshepperd2> oh wait, that's only stored for as long as it's actually in the except clause
[10:17:03] <nshepperd2> that's ok then
[10:17:31] <shawwwn> It is?
[10:17:41] <shawwwn> I thought it always stored the last exc

[11:59:41] <yorick> so I wonder about https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood-injection-injury_type_phobia , wikipedia calls it a phobia but it really doesn't match the category, it feels like a very physical response, and I can trigger it with some non-blood related things, like watching a documentary about phantom limbs or reading about TENS
[11:59:42] <Robomot> Blood-injection-injury type phobia - Wikipedia (Blood-injection-injury (BII) type phobia is a type of specific phobia[1][2] characterized by the display of excessive, irrational fear in response to the sight of blood, injury, or injection, or in anticipation of an injection, injury, or exposure to blood.[3] Blood-like stimuli (paint, ketchup) may also cause a reaction.[ ‚Ä¶)

[12:02:14] <yorick> didn't know it was this rare, maybe it's like arnold's nerve cough reflex which is estimated at 3% but everyone I know has it so maybe the methodology was flawed

[21:39:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yeah, all of this is totally unsurprising and largely familiar
[21:40:15] <Obormot\Arcturus> One thing that's interesting to note is ... very few people who are in favor of socialism are even acquainted with the example of India
[21:40:39] <Obormot\Arcturus> Even as a standard anti-socialist argument to rebut (because the anti- side is also unfamiliar with it)
[21:40:45] <Obormot\Arcturus> But it's such a huge case study!
[21:41:08] <Obormot\Arcturus> Possibly even the biggest one, counting by population (when did India surpass China in head count?)
[21:41:32] <quanticle> I don't think it has, yet.
[21:41:38] <Obormot\Arcturus> What? No way
[21:42:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> Hmmm you're right about the current numbers
[21:42:12] <quanticle> They're close. India is at 1.366 billion and China is at 1.398 billion
[21:42:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> But I could've sworn India pulled out ahead at one point

Yes, I got the Buddhist reincarnation theme form the story, and enlightenment was discussed explicitly enough that I couldn't help wondering if Zhang is supposed to be a Buddha figure.  I got no "Jesus" connection, though.  Did I miss something?
