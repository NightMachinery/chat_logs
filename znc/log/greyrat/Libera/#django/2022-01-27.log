[00:49:54] <Staunch> what is the best way to assert that an object can have at most one related object with a certain quality?
[00:50:21] <Staunch> more specifically, i have a Production model which can have any number of Roles, and i want to ensure there can only be one Role with `is_lead=True`
[00:50:50] <Staunch> is that best done on a custom `clean`? Does that go on Role (which has the foreignkey) or on Production?

[01:27:31] <dre> something like ".filter(is_lead=True).count() <= 1" I would imagine.

[02:02:30] <hoyhoy> hello
[02:03:09] <blathijs> dre: Staunch: I had a look at my comments from earlier, I've written that a CheckConstraint is not allowed to reference other tables in any case, at least when using MySQL. My notes imply that a UniqueConstraint can reference other tables, possibly using a condition parameter, but Mysql again supports no condition parameters. But maybe your constraint could be satisfied without a condition, dunno.
[02:03:56] <hoyhoy> I'm looking for a good structure for a POST request to get data and filtering it. How can I ask for the type of operator of filtering though the request? Using 0 = >,1 = <, 2 = <= ...?
[02:04:03] <hoyhoy> Maybe there is a better and cleaner way
[02:04:19] <hoyhoy> I don't like using numbers since it's complicated for another dev to then understand the code

[05:51:40] <Guest07> UserMembership = users and their paid plans/memberships

[05:53:23] <Guest07> This is a chart I made of it
[05:54:29] <GinFuyou> looks more like 1 model to me, what problem separate one would solve?
[05:55:10] <Guest07> hmm i think you might be right because people in his youtube video questioned it also and his updated one shows one too
[05:56:01] <Guest07> Basically it is a way to track users and their paid memberships versus just subscriptions I guess if keeping it separate

[12:31:03] <hzm74> I have a list of documents on my website with checkboxes in front of it. User can check the checkboxes and push a button where a modelform comes up to enter a date. This date must be added to the selected documents.

[14:37:27] <hzm74> Is it possible to pass the id´s of selected records to another template (template ¨update_document¨, there the form Datum_Document exists and then i can run the function ¨update_document¨ to update documents with the date from Datum_Document form.

[19:39:41] <CrowX-> My django website is redirecting from http to https using 302. How could I change it to 301?

[19:41:49] <GinFuyou> How you made it do the redirect in first place? It's usually not solved on django side I beleive
[19:42:10] <moldy> CrowX-: did you set SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT?
[19:50:27] <CrowX-> moldy, yes, and it does redirect, but using 302.
[19:51:05] <moldy> i guess that's what django does then (don't remember). to modify it you can probably subclass a middleware
[19:51:20] <moldy> or do it in your webserver instead
[19:51:22] <CrowX-> I see. Thanks.

[20:38:41] <hzm74_> GinFuyou: I use a list with checkboxes and a separate modelform because choosing from a list instead of a modelchoice field is more user friendly I think. Also with a list I can select multiple records.

[20:41:07] <GinFuyou> list with checkboxes is still a multimodelchoice field
[20:41:18] <GinFuyou> It's just a matter of used widgets
[20:45:14] <hzm74_> From what I read is that it is hard to code a dropdownbox where I user can make a selection from modelrecords and than another dropdownbox is filtered by the first dropdownbox. You have to use AJAX for that?! That skills I don’t have.
[20:46:32] <hzm74_> That’s why I wanna create a list or form where users can filter modelrecords by a search textbox. I managed to get that running. I also managed to let users check records and then let a view do something to that records.
[20:47:16] <hzm74_> But I don’t manage to also add a datefield to add a record to another model related to the other model.
[20:47:44] <GinFuyou> I'm not really sure what exactly is the problem here, sorry

[23:07:07] <gordonjcp> that sounds like it would need to be in your user code
