Hence, I "translated" your remark to "up to date enough". I think that running an update every 3 weeks is pretty normal / should be acceptable.

[02:47:27] <mewt> This package looks like a happier solution

[02:47:50] <rcf> Though I just hold off on the upgrade until I can reboot 
[02:47:50] <NoImNotNineVolt> my biggest problems with only rebooting annually wasn't risk from unpatched vulns 
[02:48:12] <NoImNotNineVolt> it was that arch maintainers sometimes make breaking changes in packages

[02:48:33] <NoImNotNineVolt> and so my annual maintenance cycle was _never_ smooth

[02:50:10] <NoImNotNineVolt> that's not a great maintenance process :P
[02:50:18] <grazzolini_> rcf: yeah, but it doesn't save you completely. sometimes a hard reboot is the only solution.
[02:50:23] <bparker> rcf: my problem is updates often broke my system, so I switched to just using the "arch linux archive" with a certain date as my mirror, so that I can continue installing new packages without actually updating to newer versions of everything... that way I can survive longer in-between system breakage because it happens every single time I -Syu otherwise.

[02:50:56] <NoImNotNineVolt> to each their own.

[03:07:40] <Ghosthree3> i wouldnt try to patch it because im not interested in it yet tbh. i wouldnt mind if it just told me what services it thinks should be rebooted (and even better, why it thinks that), but it actively wants to restart things in bulk, i cant do like for example an aur helper and exclude it.
[03:07:47] <Ghosthree3> hm i guess a lib could explain it

[05:43:53] <Namarrgon> first you said that you export $PATH in zshrc, then you said it's zshenv
[05:44:48] <Namarrgon> "Commands are then read from $ZDOTDIR/.zshenv. If the shell is a login shell, commands are read from /etc/zprofile and then $ZDOTDIR/.zprofile. Then, if the shell is interactive, commands are read from /etc/zshrc and then $ZDOTDIR/.zshrc. Finally, if the shell is a login shell, /etc/zlogin and $ZDOTDIR/.zlogin are read."
[05:45:39] <Namarrgon> if you launch i3 from zlogin and export $PATH in zshrc then you're exporting it too late
[05:46:19] <Namarrgon> as llua pointed it out earlier
[05:47:24] <moskos3> Namarrgon yes my mistake, i only use .zshenv with this:

[05:50:26] <Namarrgon> comment it out and replace it with nothing
[05:50:48] <Namarrgon> then check $PATH when you get dropped to that shell
[05:51:04] <moskos3> this will cause startx to start (i have exec startx) in .zprofile

[07:08:05] <et09> is anything these days just better than grub

[07:08:20] <NetSysFire> "better" is highly subjective

[07:09:26] <NetSysFire> yeah sure

[07:09:50] <Dan39> that's a bullshit line that is always said about it
[07:09:58] <NetSysFire> not relevant
[07:10:03] * et09 takes a hard look at grub.cfg
[07:10:15] <NetSysFire> !bail
[07:10:15] <Betal> the first wiki that I have seen to use a theme like this was my local wikipedia, probably about one year or more, still pretty uncommon to find translations (if used to use the english version), they added the translations near title as combobox
[07:10:15] <phrik> Looks like NetSysFire is bailing out on this one - good luck!
[07:10:18] <Dan39> systemd "technically is modular" doesn't mean much
[07:10:28] <et09> what have i done lol
[07:10:30] <Dan39> but i like systemd itself
[07:10:33] <et09> ive started the cat bun wars
[07:10:44] <Dan39> haha
[07:10:47] * NetSysFire glares at Dan39
[07:10:56] <NetSysFire> Betal: yeah i heard of the fr wikipedia using it
[07:12:26] <et09> what kills me with configuring grub is you can't just "try it out" it has to be perfect 
[07:12:52] <Dan39> create extra menu entries so you have a good one still available
[07:13:04] * et09 makes /etc/default/grub.bkp
[07:13:11] <Dan39> that too
[07:13:26] <et09> i just want graphical grub ykno
[07:13:28] <et09> i can do that right
[07:13:32] <Betal> NetSysFire: in my case is the pt wiki, but yeah, really the same theme as fr wikipedia (didn't know fr migrated too)
[07:13:35] <Dan39> et09: well if it's a small change you can just make it during boot to test

[11:07:00] <sunyibo> I have a server running linux. I'd like to install ncdu2 on it, but I don't have aur on it. Is it generally safe or unsafe to install aur-helper and stuff from aur on a server?

[11:09:33] <SponiX> sunyibo: personally I use and love "yay". But, if only doing less than a handful of things from the AUR, the helper for sure isn't even a requirement
[11:09:48] <SponiX> you can just git clone, and makepkg -si
[11:09:56] <jelle> sunyibo: the danger in the AUR is most likely not the AUR helper but what's in the PKGBUILD ;-)

[14:28:59] <braxas> so started afterwards is fine
[14:29:12] <ne2k> braxas, if it were me, I would start it in a netns with a veth pair and tcpdump on that
[14:29:17] <braxas> actully strace works fairly well, but for some reason I can't see how it gets to an IP that it uses
[14:29:37] <braxas> but my real concern is actually, how does it decide to use the IP it uses
[14:30:01] <braxas> because I see `[pid 797093] connect(8, {sa_family=AF_INET, sin_port=htons(443), sin_addr=inet_addr("20.38.120.36")}, 16)`
[14:30:12] <braxas> but I dunno where it gets the idea to use 20.38.120.36
[14:30:16] <ne2k> braxas, do you haev the source?
[14:30:29] <ne2k> there's no getaddrinfo call before that?
[14:30:30] <braxas> yes, it is rclone, but not that helpful

[17:42:52] <cdown> mov is a container. it depends on what you've got in it.

[18:34:22] <Akulen> Hello, I'm not completely sure where to ask this, so I'll try my chance here. I'm trying to make my webcam (C920) work on my arch, however, i can't seem to. The default resolution is very poor (less than 500x500 i'd say), whey I v4l2-ctl ... --list-formats-ext, yuyv, h264 and mjpg are listed, but none have a resolution higher than 1280x720, and even using this resolution, it seems to use an
[18:34:24] <Akulen> aspect ratio of 4:3 instead of 16:9. Furthermore, when I try to use the webcam in my browser, it defaults back to the base settings, losing the intermediary resolution I've set up
[18:34:26] <Akulen> Is there some kind of driver I'm missing? Everything I could found about it was that there isn't supposed to be a driver and that the webcam should work from the start

[20:32:06] <daishun> Installing archlinux-keyring works. Thanks. I don't know how it got uninstalled.
[20:32:16] <MacGyver> I'm pretty sure I've had mine on a non-hubbed USB2 port.

[20:35:19] <MacGyver> E.g. 6-3               06cb:00bd ff 1IF  [USB 2.00,    12 Mbps, 100mA]
