[02:36:18] <FunkyBob> ok
[02:36:43] <FunkyBob> the filter is odd... you have a queryset of news44... and you filter it for Symbol__contains ... that queryset?
[02:36:55] <rannnn8888> https://dpaste.org/riPf this return me the the rsults but not "real"

[02:42:59] <FunkyBob> the more you explain, the more confused I get.
[02:43:00] <rannnn8888> i take the json after from ajax code
[02:43:11] <FunkyBob> what is calling getUser?

[02:59:17] <FunkyBob> ok... so the symbolsjson method isn't used at all
[02:59:36] <FunkyBob> and you're just showing the __str__ for each of the models that match
[02:59:41] <FunkyBob> there should be no JSON

[04:25:56] <FunkyBob> depends on its semantic meaning.  a <span> if it's inline with other text.  a <p> if it's a paragraph of text.
[04:26:00] <FunkyBob> lots of other choices

[04:26:51] <wallbroken> if i use <a> here, i see the hand to click on it
[04:27:11] <FunkyBob> yes, because <a> is an Anchor element
[04:27:36] <FunkyBob> would need to see more context to  be able to suggest a better element

[06:01:40] <rannnn8888> ahhhh seccc cheack
[06:02:03] <wallbroken> all the jobs i found requires: C# and Java enterprise
[06:02:15] <wallbroken> those are the mainstream languages in the current world
[06:02:26] <wallbroken> i just learned a lot of C#
[06:02:26] <FunkyBob> wallbroken: perhaps where you're looking...
[06:03:05] <wallbroken> people said that python is not efficient as C#
[06:03:20] <FunkyBob> depends on how you measure "efficient"
[06:03:24] <wallbroken> and C# has a very big library called .NET Core
[06:03:34] <wallbroken> it's cross platform
[06:03:46] <FunkyBob> yes... took them to v4 before they learned to code to interfaces, not types
[06:04:00] <FunkyBob> and C# designers wre heavily influenced by Python
[06:05:03] <wallbroken> i guess not
[06:05:15] <wallbroken> for example python doesn't have Generics
[06:05:25] <FunkyBob> depends
[06:05:29] <FunkyBob> what are "Generics" in this context?
[06:05:39] <wallbroken> https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/types/generics
[06:05:56] <FunkyBob> it doesn't need them
[06:06:04] <FunkyBob> Generics only make sense in statically typed languages
[06:07:15] <wallbroken> python is compiled everytime i execute a program?
[06:07:40] <wallbroken> and that's the reason why people said it's less "efficient" ?
[06:07:54] <FunkyBob> no
[06:08:04] <wallbroken> no to which statement?
[06:08:05] <FunkyBob> the .pyc files are the "compiled" version of the program
[06:08:28] <FunkyBob> but it is interpreted each time... which is why it's generally slower than systems that compile to native code, like C or C++
[06:08:44] <wallbroken> so, python is like java?
[06:08:47] <FunkyBob> and cPython doesn't have a JIT... where Java and C# do
[06:08:54] <FunkyBob> however PyPy _does_ have a JIT
[06:09:11] <FunkyBob> and can be significantly faster at Python than cPython
[06:09:11] <wallbroken> so python doesn't need a garbage collector?

[06:09:47] <FunkyBob> in your mind, are garbage collectors only used in JITs?  because that's wrong

[06:11:00] <rannnn8888> FunkyBob its look ok by this right ? https://dpaste.org/FhFt
[06:11:22] <wallbroken> in my mind a garbage collector is a system controller that takes in charge to disallocate all the parts of software that considers no more useful to free up memory
[06:11:37] <FunkyBob> rannnn8888: but... you do all that work to add the count... then throw it away?
[06:12:06] <FunkyBob> wallbroken: a garbage collector is for freeing memory that's no longer required... memory for variables no longer in use/scope

[06:12:17] <FunkyBob> wallbroken: cPython most certainly has one

[06:12:40] <wallbroken> in Ansi C it is not needed because we have the "heap" and "stack" memory
[06:13:00] <wallbroken> and after a function terminates, that memory is automatically free

[07:19:40] <blackleitus> FunkyBob, how can I do it ? in order to say update if exists other wise created , but if not exists created too
[07:20:37] <sed> maybe try some of the ways in the stackoverflow link i sent? Seems to be related. But not 100% sure ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[07:21:15] <FunkyBob> sed: please stop referencing stack overflow
[07:21:38] <FunkyBob> blackleitus: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/ref/models/querysets/#update-or-create perhaps ?
[07:22:34] <sed> ok sorry - yea the docs link works too :)

[07:23:09] <blackleitus> the above means `update_or_create` , but how can I also include filter+update ?

[07:28:56] <FunkyBob> blackleitus: I don't understand
[07:29:07] <FunkyBob> what do you mean by "include filter+update"?
[07:30:38] <blackleitus> I Mean I want to say this into django orm `update if exists other wise created , but if not exists created too `
[07:31:01] <blackleitus> https://dpaste.org/TTty
[07:31:05] <FunkyBob> "create if it doesn't exist, update if it does exist" ?
[07:31:53] <FunkyBob> it's not clear how Person and People models relate
[07:32:31] <blackleitus> it was an example

[07:32:42] <blackleitus> lets say I am working in a single model Person
[07:32:48] <FunkyBob> ok
[07:33:33] <blackleitus> how can I update, create if not exists ?

[07:33:44] <FunkyBob> ...
[07:33:53] <FunkyBob> is it that you want to use differnt values for the update ?
[07:34:09] <FunkyBob> since in your last paste is_manager is different betwee 'new_values' and 'update_values"
[07:35:25] <FunkyBob> blackleitus: otherwise create_or_update is the right way...
[07:36:40] <FunkyBob> blackleitus: how about you stop with the code examples, and just explain what ytou need?
[07:36:56] <FunkyBob> because trying to decipher your _intent_ from your code examples is not working
[07:39:59] <blackleitus> let me explain with my real code , and function then , https://dpaste.org/KYiy#L23 . I want to update Vulnerability table which contains has_exploit=bolean , but if https://dpaste.org/KYiy#L9,23 there is a vulnerability mapped with a cve from a exploit dataset then update vulnerability table right after adding exploit data to db

[08:14:46] <FunkyBob> ... and your naming is still confusing... using "vulnerability_id" when it's a whole model instance, not just an ID

[23:09:25] <blackleitus> how do I perfrom a upsert in django?
[23:10:33] <hylje> https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/ref/models/querysets/#update-or-create
[23:13:51] <blackleitus> I got https://dpaste.org/qLaw , but how exactly in the second run updates to new_values? hylje
[23:16:02] <hylje> i don't get it
[23:16:34] <hylje> it gets based on some key values and then either applies defaults if found or uses defaults to create if not
[23:17:25] <blackleitus> so basically I dont need to check if created ?
[23:17:33] <blackleitus> just send straight out
[23:18:16] <hylje> only if you know you have to do something only if it's created or updated but not the other
[23:19:27] <blackleitus> what is purpose of obj, created
[23:19:42] <hylje> it's a tuple unpack

[23:23:08] <blackleitus> what is exactly the purpose of created then?
[23:23:13] <blackleitus> obj , created
[23:23:16] *** Joins: chrysanthematic (~chrysanth@user/chrysanthematic)
[23:23:43] <hylje> if you do care whether the object was created or not, you can use it
[23:24:51] <blackleitus> I just want to perform a upsert where I need to insert if doesnt exist or if exist update modified fields
[23:25:11] <hylje> then you probably don't need to use it? just unpack it into _ and carry on
[23:25:50] <blackleitus> object, _ ?
[23:25:56] <hylje> yea
[23:26:10] <blackleitus> object returns a true / false if was created right
[23:26:18] <blackleitus> or what exactly on a variable
[23:26:28] <hylje> left one is the model object right one is a bool
[23:27:17] <blackleitus> created only tell me that the object was created in the db , but `instance` why?
[23:27:31] <blackleitus> why not only model.objects.update_or_create(..)
[23:27:48] <hylje> well if you don't care about the model object either just don't assign it??
[23:29:11] <hylje> it's your code nobody is forcing you to assign return values to variables, just telling you that you can if you want em
[23:29:25] <blackleitus> let me clarify. if I just want to say insert if dont exist, but if exist update fields. I just need to add defaults to go into dont exist mode, and field=var, field2= when it exist?
[23:30:07] <hylje> in upsert the defaults get always applied, whether or not it creates a new object varies
[23:30:42] <hylje> the other arguments perform the lookup
[23:35:05] <blackleitus> how do I Properly do the following then? https://dpaste.org/EVzC I just want to add in the first run `update_values` , and the second one `new_values`
