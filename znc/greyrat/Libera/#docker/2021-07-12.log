[01:41:42] <jushur> if one would look for a recomended OS to run docker on, what would you people say? preff one that works with everything out of the box, aka lazy mans solution ;)
[01:45:07] <p_stampy> as in, what flavour of linux?
[01:45:37] <gordonjcp> jushur: kind of inherently Linux
[01:46:29] <p_stampy> jushur: I use mint and foudn it easier to set up/run than on macos (which I had to switch to). Never tried it on windows, but I can only assume it's probably a terrible idea.
[01:46:39] <akik> jushur: centos linux 7 works good

[01:55:44] <tang^> any linux should do you
[01:56:12] <tang^> macOS and Windows require a linux vm which Docker for $OS provides
[01:59:16] <p_stampy> tang^: maybe im doing it differently on my mac, but I dont grab a vm separately to run docker. Unless that's what docker desktop is?
[01:59:39] <tang^> oh... typo on my part
[01:59:50] <tang^> "which Docker Desktop for $OS" provides
[01:59:55] <p_stampy> ohhh
[02:00:25] <tang^> though you _can_ get Windows Docker containers running natively on Windows 2016 and above
[02:00:27] <p_stampy> Yeh I only switched to mac in the last few months (after linux'ing for yearrrrrsss) and its a bit frustrating
[02:00:33] <p_stampy> lol
[02:00:47] <p_stampy> tang^: sounds like that's for crazies who have too much time :p
[02:01:15] <tang^> well, macOS is a Unix variant, not a Linux variant. so it's natively missing features that docker requires
[02:01:37] <p_stampy> The few people I know who have windows end up running linux subsystem for windows ? i can't remember its exact name.
[02:01:42] <p_stampy> Yep
[02:01:43] <tang^> sounds like that's for Windows sysadmins who want to contain their apps
[02:01:47] <p_stampy> LOL
[02:01:52] <jushur> actually there is no Linux OS, only kernels.
[02:02:02] <p_stampy> yeh
[02:02:03] <p_stampy> ok
[02:02:11] <gordonjcp> jushur: I run it on Ubuntu, because pretty much all the Linux machines I use are Ubuntu
[02:02:18] <gordonjcp> jushur: I base my containers on Alpine though
[02:02:39] <gordonjcp> except when I base them on Ubuntu, for Deep Scary Technical Reasons
[02:02:54] <tang^> basing your images on $distro is really about providing that distro's package manager
[02:02:55] <p_stampy> like, it just works ?
[02:03:08] <gordonjcp> tang^: yes and no
[02:03:14] <jushur> anyhow, i set one up with Alpine 'linux' as a host, that ended with errors. its not in the docker image, its in the host setup.
[02:03:42] <gordonjcp> tang^: Alpine is mostly great, but if you must use glibc it becomes a pain in the arse
[02:03:46] <gordonjcp> jushur: what kind of errors?
[02:04:01] <tang^> okay yeah, I should have said mainly rather than really
[02:04:12] <gordonjcp> tang^: you're right thoug
[02:04:14] <gordonjcp> *though
[02:04:45] <jushur> the service stops with a cant find socks
[02:04:50] <gordonjcp> tang^: those circumstances are the sort of thing that you would only run into when you're trying to do something really stupid like run glibc binary-only software in Docker, which isn't really the use case
[02:04:51] <jushur> something
[02:04:59] <gordonjcp> jushur: can you post the error verbatim?
[02:05:23] <tang^> try to remember that containers are not VMs and things tend to go better.
[02:05:50] <tang^> they're still running on your host OS, just isolated from the rest of the system and other containers
[02:05:52] <gordonjcp> tang^: I can't really be relied upon for advice on that sort of shit
[02:06:34] <gordonjcp> tang^: I run customised Windows XP images under qemu in docker on a remote host with qemu providing VNC access, through Apache Guacamole
[02:06:48] <tang^> condolences
[02:06:52] <tang^> sounds like a headache
[02:07:14] <gordonjcp> tang^: there's an easy way to do a thing, and a hard way to do a thing, and that's the easy way...
[02:07:32] <p_stampy> https://twitter.com/iamdevloper/status/1173559739558584321
[02:07:36] <gordonjcp> tang^: it's good fun working for blue light services
[02:07:49] <tang^> oh of course, the hard way is to get the vendors to update their applications to work on a modern OS
[02:08:01] <gordonjcp> tang^: and then get it all licenced
[02:08:23] <gordonjcp> tang^: the app will actually run not too bad in Windows 10 apparently, I know fuck all about Windows so I just trust the Windows nerds
[02:08:51] <gordonjcp> it's just illegal to connect $important_thing to the app and underlying service, unless it's running on XP
[02:08:55] <p_stampy> Agh I can't find the tweet/replies but there was a pretty funny thread about people trying to explain docker
[02:09:15] <gordonjcp> tang^: I realise this makes no sense
[02:09:24] <gordonjcp> tang^: but, this is what I do all day :-)
[02:12:02] <jushur> gordonjcp: the 'rc-service --verbose docker start'
[02:12:17] <gordonjcp> jushur: okay, and can you post the error verbatim?
[02:14:02] <jushur> erors with 'supervice-daemon: fopen `/var/run/supervise-docker.pidÂ´: No such file or directory'
[02:15:00] <tang^> too many typos to be verbatim
[02:15:08] <gordonjcp> yeah
[02:15:36] <gordonjcp> jushur: you need to actually give the error message, copied directly from the terminal

[04:24:03] <gordonjcp> what the hell am I typing

[04:24:43] <gordonjcp> but you can set a router to point to a particular certresolver
[04:25:12] <Lutin> true but what if you do that twice, for an exaple 2 vhosts on the same container ?

[14:21:51] <Repox> Hey. I have a Docker Compose environment that is acting up a bit. My issue is that whenever I restart my computer or just Docker for Desktop (on my MacOS) this specific Docker Compose environment starts on it's own whenever Docker is started. Even though I run docker compose stop or docker compose down, the environment keeps getting booted every time the Docker instance is rebooted. Might someone know where to look for disabling that?

[15:13:50] <Repox> Another topic, that I'm currently struggling with is running two containers (without docker compose) and have them talk together. It's a Nginx container and a PHP-FPM container. The Nginx virtualhost is trying to proxy PHP requests to `127.0.0.1:9000`. And I'm running both containers with `docker run --rm -p 80:80 nginx-image` and `docker run --rm -p 9000:9000 php-fpm-image` but the Nginx image is getting a "connection refused" from the PHP-FPM container.
[15:13:50] <Repox>  How can I solve this?
[15:14:33] <Repox> I tried naming the container and referincing the named container inside the Nginx image, but that didn't work. 
[15:15:42] <Repox> I assume that the default network is bridged, but my Nginx container and PHP container isn't on the same network.

[15:26:32] <DrowningElysium> Issue I am having with WSL2: I have created an Ubuntu WSL2 where I keep the code. Now I run docker compose start from this directory and it will add some images that do things for the project. When I try to do anything related to files I get permission denied (For example creating some files). I now chmodded the files to 777 and that fixes it for now. But what is the correct solution to fix this? Error is gotten with for example 
[15:26:32] <DrowningElysium> mkdir() in PHP. I can provide some stuff, but I am also clueless about some parts
[15:27:02] <DrowningElysium> I do hope of course to fix the clueless part soon and build some own develop images. But currently I will use what exists
[15:38:11] <rawtaz> already told you, you have to be more specific :P

[15:39:40] <s17> DrowningElysium: I'm pretty sure you'll have to make sure those files/directories are using the same user or group as the httpd 
[15:39:50] <s17> 777 is usually a bad solution
[15:40:02] <DrowningElysium> Ah, even if that group/user is not on my original image?
[15:40:39] <DrowningElysium> I have Ubuntu (Default image I will be using), then a Apache/PHP image with all the tools on there to develop
[15:40:46] <DrowningElysium> And well the files are on Ubuntu
[15:41:11] <DrowningElysium> The apache/PHP is a docker images which should be easily replaceable

[15:41:35] <s17> maybe you can make a user/group inside the Ubuntu which matches what apache-php expects?
[15:42:01] <DrowningElysium> Will try, thanks
[15:42:17] <rawtaz> lol. DE, i already told you teh following things 1) it depends on how you mount the directory. 2) you need to be more specific. 3) you should probably show the Dockerfile(s). 4) you need to be more specific. despite this, you dont provide any of this information.
[15:42:23] <rawtaz> that is not a very constructive way to get help.
[15:42:40] <DrowningElysium> Sorry, I don't know what to provide
[15:42:41] <rawtaz> for example s17 trying to help you have no idea how you mount the dir or if it's a volume. that makes a huge difference
[15:42:56] <rawtaz> then you are not reading what i wrote i guess
[15:43:15] <s17> mmhm..  this is what I have in my docker-compose: user: www-data:80
[15:43:27] <rawtaz> if you dont know what to provide, then why do you just not say anything about it instead of just ask what parts of it you dont understand
[15:43:33] * rawtaz heads out
[15:43:43] <s17> my local (host) httpd runs as user/group apache which is gid 80, 
[15:43:49] <DrowningElysium> Basically in a Dockerfile we have: WORKDIR /var/www (guess this is what mounts it)

[18:30:28] <Lutin> as it seems you can set the desired network for it as well
[18:33:17] <akik> Lutin: yes i've set those networks in traefik.yaml

[18:35:30] <akik> sure but it's just a normal yaml file i stack deply
[18:36:25] <artok> services handled by traefik need to be in same network, but if there are services that aren't exposed to outside world, why need for certs handled by traefik?
[18:37:34] <akik> Lutin: https://pastebin.com/raw/hL757ebC
[18:39:05] <Lutin> akik yeah nice and it just picks up when you put a container in that network with labels or do you specify the traefik network in there as well as label... so traefik knows which network to use ? Need to read more about that topic tho
[18:39:09] <gordonjcp> artok: I guess if you're exposing stuff to an internal network it still needs a cert
[18:39:24] <gordonjcp> artok: like if you've got an intranet server, that still requires a cert
[18:39:26] <Lutin> gordonjcp indeed
[18:39:46] <Lutin> gordonjcp why all the hassle in other ways
[18:40:09] <Lutin> with Caddy I jus would have mounted the cert as it creates a key and pem file
[18:40:22] <gordonjcp> use caddy then
[18:40:25] <Lutin> with traefik I do see SAN issues lately, they are not added to the cert
[18:40:48] <gordonjcp> it sounds like caddy might be a better tool for the job
[18:41:02] <Lutin> gordonjcp no because caddy is not nice for services like IMAP/SMTP and such and traefik is just offloading like haproxy can do as well
[18:41:23] <Lutin> I like caddy tho
[18:41:45] <Lutin> traefik seems to be faster as well

[20:21:57] <lmat> ada_: Multiple users SSH to a server. Each of them is working on the same project, so much of the cache should be reusable, but they're in their own home directory with their own git repositories, etc.
[20:23:41] <lmat> By the way, I have a docker-compose.yml stack with two services "one" and "two". When I `docker-compose up;` it creates two docker containers: proj_one_1 and proj_two_1. They're using the same docker-compose network. This makes sense; my question is, within "one", how can I use the docker-compose stack DNS to contact "two"? `ping two;` works, but should `ping proj_two_1;` also work?
[20:24:01] <ada_> lmat: yes, the long service name should also work
[20:24:15] <lmat> On a colleague's machine, using the container name seems to work, but on my machine, I have to use the service name, "one".
[20:24:50] <lmat> ada_: "one" should route to a load balancer which in this case simply forwards all traffic to the one task: proj_one_1. proj_one_1 routes directly to the one container?
[20:24:50] <ada_> you're saying that the long service name does NOT work?
[20:24:53] <Lutin> akik do you use SAN's with traefik ? I have issues with them lately, only get the parent domain
[20:25:06] <lmat> ada_: Yes, for me, the long service name (the task name? the container name?) doesn't work.
[20:25:15] <ada_> lmat: are you deploying as swarm services or as containers?
[20:25:47] <lmat> ada_: docker-compose up; so I think neither. I would call them "docker-compose services", but I'm not sure the correct terminology.
[20:25:52] <ada_> they are containers
[20:25:57] <akik> Lutin: no, just one fqdn
[20:26:04] <ada_> so there's no LB internally with containers API
[20:26:33] <ada_> there is only a DNS record and the container's IP.  if you were deploying as swarm services using `docker stack deploy` then there would be an IPVS VIP established for each service, and each container/task would have an individual IP
[20:26:51] <lmat> ada_: (swarm services I would think would be deployed using   docker stack deploy -c <file>)
[20:27:17] <lmat> ada_: docker-compose can't use "replicas: 2"?
[20:27:24] <Lutin> akik okay, then I might file a bug
[20:27:32] <ada_> lmat: it doesn't make "real" replicas
[20:27:37] <lmat> :-o

[20:28:25] <ada_> lmat: I mean they are distinct instances of a container with different but similar names
[20:28:44] <ada_> if you depoy service `foo` with replicas: 2, using plain containers, you'd have foo_1 and foo_2 and they have different DNS records
[20:28:52] <ada_> ping foo will only ever go to foo_1 iirc

[21:53:59] <ada_> its not very feasible to map every single place to a volume where that could happen
[21:54:03] <ada_> what problem are you trying to solve?
[21:54:26] <ada_> like, the typical use case is "I want to put mysql in a container" not "I want to run ubuntu in a sandbox and play around with Ubuntu" 
[21:54:32] <ada_> the ubuntu container doesn't have a whole ubuntu in it
[21:54:38] <ada_> its just a means to an end to getting packages installed

[21:55:48] <luvalon> so having a docker container of ubuntu isnt the same as having a virtual machine with ubuntu
[21:56:05] <ada_> correct
[21:56:16] <Lutin> I have something weird going on on a container as this worked but not after a redeploy. When I exec into this container before it exits I can ping the servicename proxysql_proxy so something in resolving goes wrong Unable to get UIDcounts: dial tcp: lookup proxysql_proxy on 127.0.0.11:53: no such host
[21:56:20] <luvalon> I mean of course I knew it isnt, but I mean i understand that its not usable in this way

[21:56:37] <ada_> luvalon: it isn't completely unusable, its just anti-pattern
[21:56:46] <ada_> luvalon: like, I don't know all the posible places you'd have to map.  it would be a large list
[21:57:23] <luvalon> okay, well thanks for the information ada, just thought while Im using docker why not use it to fast test, but there are other solutions for that then. Thansk a lot
[21:57:42] <iffraff> Hi, I am getting some really wierd behavior.  I have an app.  When I run it with what seems like a very standard docker file, I get a strange error.  it's a typescript error but that I believe is not relevant.  When I create a new directory, copy the code over and set that as the working directory it works.  Please take a look at my gist 
[21:57:42] <iffraff> https://gist.github.com/reharik/270a16bc93ea5c989f6796747f545025
[21:58:15] <ada_> iffraff: you need to include the commands you ran and the error output
[21:58:33] <ada_> iffraff: otherwise we won't know if it's during a "docker run" or "docker build";  the "how" you encountered the error.
[21:58:49] <ada_> if it's during build, include the build log output as well
[21:59:22] <ada_> also you should use a more recent docker-compose syntax version, like 3.7
[21:59:36] <iffraff> well the gist shows the docker-compose.  the error is a compile time but not image build time error. It's a typescript error, but really there is something else going on
[21:59:51] <ada_> well what you said doesn't change what I said
[21:59:53] <iffraff> hmm ok, I guess that's old
[22:00:15] <ada_> we still need to see HOW you encountered the problem, otherwise how am I suupposed to know what data in the compose file is relevant...
[22:00:33] <iffraff> okey dokey I'll add them to the gist 
[22:01:02] *** Joins: varaindemian (~varaindem@86.124.22.31)
[22:01:13] <ada_> nothing in this file suggests compilation is happening, so, I must be missing something
[22:01:19] <ada_> the dockerfiles don't do any work
[22:01:26] <ada_> and the compose file startup command is a yarn start
[22:01:41] <ada_> nowhere in there is there a "compilation" step as far as I can see it so I'm stumped
[22:02:46] *** Joins: Sasazuka (~Sasazuka@user/sasazuka)
[22:02:52] <iffraff> yes, ( I'm starting it up to get the error ) so it's a webpack application, I'm putting it in a container and building it ( compiling it ) and starting a webdev server.  But the thing is, it works in the home/fu directory but not the home/current directory.
[22:04:12] <ada_> so a description doesn't really tell me much
[22:04:22] <ada_> you'd have to show me the code that's relevant, commands you ran, and the resulting error
[22:04:42] <ada_> there are lots of ways to "start it up" and nothing about your description makes it clearer where the error comes from
[22:04:43] <iffraff> ok so I added the error and the command to start to the gist.  let me know whatelse I can put up there
[22:04:43] <iffraff> https://gist.github.com/reharik/270a16bc93ea5c989f6796747f545025
[22:04:58] <ada_> so I assume you ran docker-compose `something`
[22:05:04] <ada_> ah its there
[22:05:21] <devslash> luvalon, the best thing to do is to create your own Dockerfile and build an image with wghatever packages you need
[22:05:39] <devslash> its really easy to do..
[22:05:44] <iffraff> I have done all kinds digging in.  the two directories have exactly the same files.  they have the same permissions.  I just don't get it
[22:06:17] <ada_> iffraff: something doesn't add up, if what you say is true.  they must not be the same, or some other assumption you have made is wrong
[22:06:20] <luvalon> Thanks for the information. I already know how to build dockerfiles, so I will try
[22:06:25] <iffraff> one other thing is that if I don't specify a working directory, it copies all the code to the root directory and that works
[22:06:28] <devslash> ok
[22:06:46] <ada_> iffraff: generally, if you have done tests, you should include those in your gist so the person helping doesn't have to parse the chat AND your gist
[22:07:05] <ada_> iffraff: it really helps to have all the information in one place; imagine if you were helping 4 different people each with 3 or 5 different links to random pieces of code
[22:07:12] <ada_> PLUS the chat
[22:07:22] <devslash> make sure you build only 1 layer in your Dockerfile
[22:07:25] <iffraff> I see.  so just include a sort of readme in the gist?
[22:07:34] <ada_> iffraff: i mean, it doesn't have to be so formal

[22:07:52] <ada_> ues
[22:07:53] <ada_> yes
[22:08:03] <iffraff> I can do that now if it would still help
[22:08:23] <ada_> it would be the only way to provide help, I imagine;  especially if the people you ask are not specifically yarn experts
[22:08:30] <ada_> <-
[22:08:46] <ada_> I don't really get the point of the dockerfile though
[22:08:55] <ada_> like, you make a dir, and then copy everything into it, only to run the code from that dir?
[22:09:17] <ada_> is there a goal to this exercise?  like some sort of end state you're trying to get to?
[22:09:31] <artok> looking at that gist, I'm not stopping saying: build your docker images elsewhere, run them in compose 
[22:09:35] <artok> =D
[22:09:50] <ada_> I think this error happens during run
[22:10:00] <artok> yeah, but just saying
[22:10:20] <iffraff> yes, this is stripped down.  It is an application that I am running in a container, but ok ok, I'm adding details to the gist.  one moment
[22:11:20] <artok> while "run" is compiling and starting or something
[22:15:33] <artok> btw, for a someone else provided base image, I woudn't suggest doing apt-get update && upgrade, since there might be some version conflicts
[22:17:16] <iffraff> artok: really I thought I read that I should do that somewhere, that's good to know

[22:27:59] <ada_> I don't understand the question
[22:28:08] <ada_> the advertise addr is only used by other nodes to join the swarm

[22:30:25] <Lutin> ada_ yes but updating de service doesn't change it ?

[22:37:48] <jwr> I'm seeing that `--platform` doesn't seem to work like I would expect.
