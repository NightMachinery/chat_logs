[00:20:05] <MatthiasVance> Just 3D print it lz_
[00:20:06] <MichaelLong> lz_, no with those you need a lens, otherwise you need to buy another class of camera e.g. like those panasonic tz-series with build in lens
[00:20:15] <MatthiasVance> Then you get even further from your goal xD
[00:20:56] <MatthiasVance> lz_: Create a flat surface of what you want and scan it very high res instead? :D
[00:21:10] <lz_> MichaelLong: yeah I eventually figured I needed that lens :( MatthiasVance: yes it's getting ridiculous, I'm not sure what I'm doing anymore
[00:21:35] <MatthiasVance> lz_: My advice, finish everything with low res third party textures for proof of concept
[00:21:39] <MatthiasVance> Then you have proven you *can*
[00:24:04] <lz_> MatthiasVance: I'm not sure I'll finish that game :) I thought I could sell textures instead, but I guess I'll never even cover the hw cost
[00:24:26] <biberu> just mentioning it for the curiosity because this is another thing entirely, but you could probably put a pinhole on it
[00:25:37] <lz_> also the more expensive the hw is, the bigger is the nightmare if sth wrong happens with it, like if I break it by accident etc
[00:26:15] <MatthiasVance> lz_: Yes, think big but make sure you chop it up into small pieces and finish them one by one
[00:26:28] <lz_> what I mean is, on average it's not just a one shot spending, it has repercussions down the line
[00:29:08] <lz_> I forgot how it's called but I learned this in school; you don't just plan for direct costs
[00:32:13] <biberu> lz_: what were you planning to do with the camera?
[00:32:22] <lz_> biberu: textures of things, like walls, grass, etc
[00:32:42] <biberu> i'd imagine c# pays better?
[00:32:52] <lz_> btw if you have an idea of what lens I need for that :) not sure if I need a small or big one
[00:33:12] <lz_> I was going for the 35mm one which seemed to be averge
[00:34:03] <lz_> biberu: I'm actually paid to do c++, very, very, very little given I'm a contractor
[00:34:14] <lz_> if I get sick for a week I'm basically fucked
[00:34:51] <MatthiasVance> Does a job fit you more?
[00:35:02] <lz_> I don't know how to tell this politely to my employer so I gave up negociating for now
[00:35:03] <xb0o2> I hate to sound harsh but it seems like an odd choice to decide to buy a camera, with the idea being to sell your work, if you're new enough to the skill that you don't know what lens(es) you would need to do the work.
[00:35:30] <lz_> xb0o2: making textures is not real photography work though
[00:35:36] <xb0o2> Knowing that there are a *lot* of very talented photographers who receive nothing for their work.
[00:35:46] <biberu> lz_: no idea of specifics, but if you want to make them repeatable i imagine you'll want something with low distortion, rectilinear
[00:36:18] <lz_> biberu: I figured the bigger lens would give me less perspective, but may not be good enough for closer shots; that's why i thought the averge one would be a good start
[00:36:27] <xb0o2> lz_: if there is a profit to be made from "not real photography" and the only cost is an up front one for the camera, I suspect many people would've been there and done that before you.
[00:36:33] <xb0o2> I may be wrong though.
[00:36:55] <lz_> xb0o2: yeah, I'm not only making pictures, I actually have put a lot of work on this for creating normal maps etc
[00:36:55] <biberu> lz_: the focal length affects your fov, lenses have many more properties
[00:37:05] <MatthiasVance> lz_: How is making textures not real photography?
[00:37:15] <lz_> xb0o2: and I doubt regular photographs can do what I'm doing on this
[00:37:17] <xb0o2> Does seem like you have a marketable skill in knowing how to write C++, though, and you might be better off focussing on that.
[00:37:33] <lz_> MatthiasVance: because it's basically taking a picture of a plane, there's no big deal with framing, focus, etc
[00:38:09] <lz_> xb0o2: I have knowledge in real time 3d, I'm using it all for this project
[00:38:19] <xb0o2> I see.
[00:39:31] <biberu> lz_: familiar with e.g. barrel distortion?
[00:39:50] <lz_> biberu: sort of, I guess this can be corrected with opencv
[00:40:13] <lz_> biberu: but if I can have a good enough picture to start with I'd prefer that
[00:40:17] <biberu> possibly?

[01:00:27] <lz_> xb0o2: lol yeah. That's actually the mindset I'm trying to get into. Premptively considering this just a big loss so it's less painful later when I realize how I wasted it all
[01:01:45] <lz_> I could go, and probably will go, with a compromise like a broken camera, but then all the time spent shooting things will also be devalued
[01:02:57] <MatthiasVance> Or
[01:03:05] <MatthiasVance> You buy one and write off the tax
[01:03:13] <MatthiasVance> And then later sell it if you don't need it for the project anymore
[01:03:38] <MatthiasVance> You aren't buying this shit without writing off the tax, right? You said you were a contractor
[01:03:41] <lz_> MatthiasVance: can't write off the tax; but yeah, reselling it later was on my mind. Can't resell if broken or stolen though
[01:04:03] <MatthiasVance> You just said you're doing contract work?
[01:04:03] <MatthiasVance> So you have a business entity?
[01:04:09] <lz_> MatthiasVance: as a single person company I don't get to write off taxes :( I also need to pay VAT
[01:04:40] <MatthiasVance> Heh, why is that
[01:04:47] <lz_> it's the shittiest company status you can think of in my country
[01:04:55] <MatthiasVance> I have the same thing but can write off
[01:04:59] <MatthiasVance> You can actually choose
[01:05:14] <MatthiasVance> Because if you don't write off you don't need to file taxes etc
[01:06:55] <lz_> when I was selling stuff on google store, it was crazy; they were applying VAT on the price, whereas I'm not suppose to bill VATs for my services. So in the end it was like, google take 30% + 20%VAT I wasn't supposed to pay, already half the price gone
[01:07:17] <MatthiasVance> wtf
[01:07:25] <MatthiasVance> That sounds backwards? :P
[01:07:31] <lz_> because it is
[01:07:44] <lz_> google doesn't give the option not to bill VAT
[01:09:05] <lz_> see the mail exchanges (in english) https://blog.ingeniooz.com/peut-on-recuperer-la-tva-sur-les-ventes-dapplications-mobiles-android-via-le-play-store/
[01:09:46] <lz_> and the tax service in french later explains that there's no way to get that back
[01:12:30] <lz_> french developper on app stores: you pay VAT, you can't not bill VAT, you pay eggregious fees to google, you also pay your regular income tax, + they fucking added another land tax EVEN if you work from home
[01:12:51] <lz_> for which you already pay land taxes
[01:13:24] <lz_> + you pay for some retirement you'll probably never get
[01:18:26] <MatthiasVance> :o
[01:20:12] <MatthiasVance> lz_: That tax person says "If you opt for a real VAT tax regime, you will have to invoice and collect VAT, you will only be able to deduct the VAT on your purchase invoices and your accounting and tax obligations would be more onerous."
[01:20:29] <MatthiasVance> lz_: What does that entail? Isn't that the same thing I said that you can choose whether or not you want to do VAT?

[01:22:44] <lz_> MatthiasVance: nvm you can
[01:22:51] <MatthiasVance> Ahh
[01:23:22] <MatthiasVance> You do deduct expenses from your income right for tax purposes?
[01:23:54] <lz_> yes that's what he says
[01:24:00] <MatthiasVance> No I mean it differently sorry
[01:24:14] <MatthiasVance> I don't mean in the context of VAT, but in your personal context
[01:24:27] <lz_> oh, no I don't, that's what I meant when I was saying I was paying VAT for everything
[01:24:35] <MatthiasVance> You're a contracter so everything you buy can at least be deducted from your income as an expense
[01:24:38] <MatthiasVance> Therefore paying less income tax
[01:24:44] <lz_> and for non business things, VAT is always included
[01:24:46] <MatthiasVance> And the camera costing .. -50%
[01:24:48] <MatthiasVance> Yes
[01:24:52] <MatthiasVance> I am not talking about VAT here
[01:25:16] <lz_> ok I see
[01:25:34] <MatthiasVance> If you are a (single-person) company and you make EUR 1000. You pay X * 1000 income tax for that. But if you buy something worth EUR 500. You deduct that and only have to pay X * 500 income tax
[01:25:49] <MatthiasVance> That might be another route for you and I hope you already do that with ALL your expenses if possible :D
[01:26:01] <lz_> MatthiasVance: if you want to translate, the answer is no, I can't deduct anything https://www.assistant-juridique.fr/deduction_charges_autoentrepreneur.jsp

[12:13:58] <ASUS> I fixed it
[12:14:05] <ASUS> str.Split(' ');
[12:14:22] <ASUS> in .NET 6 Core you can split with a string
[12:14:29] <ASUS> in .NET you can't

[14:47:55] <MootPoot> Does anyone have experience connecing ASP.NET apps to Azure SQL DBs?
[14:48:06] <MootPoot>  ASP.NET also being hosted in azure
[14:49:01] <MootPoot> I followed the steps online but it seems like the way I wrote the app ( local SQL server with connectionstring ) isen't playing well, I created the Azure DB, ran all the SQL to load it up, but I seem to be having a connectionstring issue
[14:50:13] <MatthiasVance> So how did you configure it?
[14:50:45] <MootPoot> Simply with SqlConnection - the official ADO library
[14:50:54] <MootPoot> before I was connecting using localhost\SQLEXPRESS
[14:51:16] <MatthiasVance> I mean the connectionstring
[14:51:52] <MootPoot> uh, I just copied the string from my azure panel for the specific DB and pasted it in where I was formerly using my localhost SQL server connectionstring
[14:52:01] <MatthiasVance> Into what file exactly?
[14:52:14] <MootPoot> my model handler class
[14:52:19] <MatthiasVance> Oh it's in your code
[14:52:29] <MatthiasVance> I was expecting something like you put it in appsettings.Development.json
[14:52:43] <MatthiasVance> What is the error you're getting then?
[14:53:31] <MootPoot> what I'm using right now is this
[14:53:33] <MootPoot> MasterConnection.ConnectionString = @"tcp:applicationdbserver1.database.windows.net,1433; Initial Catalog = Application_db; Persist Security Info = False; User ID = adminadmin; Password ={ your_password}; MultipleActiveResultSets = False; Encrypt = True; TrustServerCertificate = False; Connection Timeout = 30";
[14:54:09] <MootPoot> when I go to the URL it tells me I posted it to , this is the error
[14:54:11] <MootPoot> ArgumentException: Keyword not supported: 'tcp:applicationdbserver1.database.windows.net,1433; initial catalog'.
[14:54:24] <MatthiasVance> Seems you're missing the keyword
[14:54:28] <MootPoot> what keyword?
[14:54:38] <MatthiasVance> What was your old connectionstring?
[14:54:51] <MootPoot> MasterConnection.ConnectionString = @"Data Source=localhost\SQLEXPRESS; Initial Catalog=master; Integrated Security=True";
[14:54:58] <MatthiasVance> Sooo.. what is different?
[14:55:26] <MootPoot> I mean, there is a bunch of extra stuff in the new one for azure
[14:55:35] <MatthiasVance> The most important thing is how you specify the host
[14:55:57] <MatthiasVance> In your Azure variant you just copied in the host name without specifying that that part of the connection string is used for the host
[14:55:58] <MootPoot> the Data Source=
[14:56:02] <MootPoot> ?
[14:56:26] <MatthiasVance> Yes, seems that you are missing that :)

[14:59:25] <MatthiasVance> You're welcome!
[14:59:55] <MatthiasVance> MootPoot: As a next step, don't put connection strings in your code
[15:00:10] <MootPoot> you aren't supposed to do that?
[15:00:14] <MootPoot> uh
[15:00:31] <MootPoot> that's how I was taught during my ASP classes back in uni
[15:00:40] <MootPoot> I presume they go in some  special config file?
[15:01:03] <MatthiasVance> What version of .NET were you using in those classes?
[15:01:39] <MootPoot> I just graduated a few days ago - doing this as part of a code test for my first job
[15:01:48] <MatthiasVance> Congratulations!
[15:01:59] <MootPoot> although back when I was in class it was NET 3 or 4
[15:02:02] <MootPoot> dont remember
[15:02:06] <MatthiasVance> Ahh yeah a lot has changed
[15:02:13] <MootPoot> I remember I nearly failed my final project a year ago
[15:02:30] <MatthiasVance> That was the old ".NET Framework" which was very Windows centric and kind of monolithic
[15:02:50] <MootPoot> I spent two months working on it, it worked perfectly then all of a sudden it wouldn't host
[15:03:11] <MootPoot> realized that I was using a .NET version too new and the uni server's wouldn't accept it
[15:03:13] <MatthiasVance> Over the years Microsoft did a full rewrite (called it .NET Core, you might seem references of that) but now finally said 'Okay this is the new thing, we go further with this and call it .NET 5 .. and now 6)
[15:03:47] <MatthiasVance> MootPoot: Ah yeah :)
[15:03:54] <MootPoot> so I had to go beg my prof - showed him it working on my local pc and he let me have 4 hours overtime to copy/paste it all into a new project with the older NET version
[15:03:56] <MootPoot> lmao
[15:04:00] <MootPoot> much panic
[15:04:26] <MatthiasVance> Instead of just changing the version in the project file??
[15:04:33] <MootPoot> Tried , dosen't work
[15:04:42] <MootPoot> asked my professor and he said it works in theory but not in practice
[15:05:04] <MatthiasVance> Pfft, lies :P
[15:05:12] <MatthiasVance> But yeah with the OLD .NET Framework you can get tht
[15:05:18] <MatthiasVance> Everything is much simpler now
[15:05:28] <MootPoot> This one is built on 5, I was going to use 6, but they changed it a little and I didnt want to try something new for a code test where I'm under time pressure
[15:05:36] <MatthiasVance> That's very good!
[15:05:43] <MootPoot> they got rid of the code behind part that I learned to do everything in
[15:05:43] <MatthiasVance> Good that you're already using 5
[15:05:52] <MatthiasVance> Code behind, you used WebForms?
[15:05:57] <MatthiasVance> Ohh that's old
[15:06:01] <MootPoot> no longer is there a index.cshtml.cs
[15:06:05] <MootPoot> that I can do my stuff in
[15:06:19] <MatthiasVance> MootPoot: That technology is WebForms and I hope nobody has to use it anymore :D
[15:06:40] <MootPoot> lol - well I used net 5 since it has webforms :3
[15:06:49] <MootPoot> otherwise I would have made this project with 6
[15:06:55] <MootPoot> I jsut didnt know where everything went
[15:07:45] <MootPoot> I've figured out from many panicked late night sessions that more often then not google dosen't have your solution
[15:07:58] <MootPoot> easier to just take a chill time learning it throughly
[15:08:06] <MatthiasVance> Yes, definitely, don't do that under pressure :)
[15:09:19] <MootPoot> it was a simple app - fetch data from SQL server ( locations ) and display weather for them from API
[15:09:29] <MootPoot> the catch was I was rusty - no ASP for over a year
[15:09:45] <MootPoot> and then they wanted additional front end fancy stuff I had to do in JS
[15:10:42] <MootPoot> anyway - I'm going to clock out now, its almost morning where I am
[15:10:58] <MootPoot> Thanks for the help - you got me an exfra hour of sleep.

[20:16:02] <JakeSays> xb0o2: every parent's worst nightmare
[20:16:25] <JakeSays> those look expensive
[20:17:52] <xb0o2> Fortunately they're one of the cheaper models (about £800 all in)
[20:19:18] <JakeSays> they look like fun
[20:19:28] <xb0o2> Less of a nightmare than a real drum kit would be I hope
[20:20:07] <JakeSays> lol interesting choice for a model
[20:20:29] <JakeSays> frumpy housewife doesn't fit my view of a drummer
[20:22:09] <xb0o2> Could be any one of us
[20:22:26] <Inge>  Any of us could be a frumpy housewife?
[20:22:39] <JakeSays> not me. i have zero music talent
[20:23:00] <xb0o2> Correct, inge
[20:23:05] <JakeSays> lol
[20:23:24] <xb0o2> For example I've never seen a picture of JakeSays, so...
[20:23:29] <Inge> Could be true
[20:23:54] <JakeSays> i have the frumpy part down for sure
[20:24:44] <xb0o2> Well you could become a housewife in no time

[20:26:45] <JakeSays> i'd prefer to have a housewife than become one
[20:26:59] <xb0o2> Why not both?
[20:27:10] <xb0o2> Might get some electronic drum kit modelling gigs out of it
[20:27:13] <JakeSays> could be anyone's housewife

[20:36:45] <ravindUwU> Hiii!
[20:36:45] <learningc> Is there a way to tell which key is valid when an invalid key exception is raised from a dictionary?
[20:37:04] <learningc> is invalid I mean
[20:37:17] <JakeSays> learningc: yeah. the key that was being inserted
[20:37:50] <ravindUwU> My EF core foreign key adds a bunch of shadow properties (I think?) despite explicitly specifying the keys of the relationship with the [ForeignKey("...")] attribute... any idea why this is?
[20:39:32] <canton7> learningc, IIRC that info got added in a version of .NET a few years ago
[20:39:40] <learningc> JakeSays then we need to verify first if the key exist...  what I mean is when calling the dictionary with a key, the dictionary will automatically tell which key is invalid and display it
[20:40:26] <JakeSays> learningc: well, it shouldn't display anything.
[20:40:55] <learningc> JakeSays, ok.  But is there a way to make it do so?
[20:41:03] <canton7> learningc, that 'invalid key exception' specifically do you mean?
[20:41:06] <JakeSays> catch the exception and print it
[20:41:07] <canton7> s/what/what/
[20:41:24] <canton7> ack. I fail at typing. *What 'invalid key exception' specifically do you mean
[20:41:24] <JakeSays> learningc: or use trygetvalue instead of []
[20:41:31] <learningc> The problem I am having is sometimes the key is not present in the dictionary because I read keys from a file
[20:41:57] <canton7> So a KeyNotFoundException?
[20:42:28] <canton7> The exception message has contained the key for a few .NET versions now. But if you're not sure whether a key exists in the dictionary, do use a TryGetValue instead
[20:42:49] <learningc> canton7, that's right, keynotfoundexception
[20:44:01] <learningc> canton7, is there a way to change the exception message to display the name of the key that is not present in the dictionary?
[20:44:23] <canton7> The exception message already contains the key, that's what I'm saying
[20:44:53] <learningc> canton7, does not seem to be in my case...
[20:44:59] <canton7> See here: https://sharplab.io/#v2:EYLgxg9gTgpgtADwGwBYA0AXEUCuA7AHwAEAmABgFgAoUgRmqLIAIjaUBua6gNwEMomAEwCWYDEwC8TPDADuTACKiMwiHn4BPADysyaFrTIA+ABQBKTlQD6kocoDaAIgBmECI4C6loA=
[20:45:27] <JakeSays> canton7: i dont think framework includes the key
[20:45:29] <learningc> canton7, ohhh!
[20:45:48] <canton7> Yeah, like I said before, it's been there for a few .NET versions now
[20:45:58] <JakeSays> right
[20:46:11] <JakeSays> i'm surprised it was added.
[20:46:34] <canton7> 2017 by the looks of it

[23:59:06] <Suchiman> hseg: your options are either doing that or using a List that you pass through to helper methods and you just add eagerly to the list and return that
