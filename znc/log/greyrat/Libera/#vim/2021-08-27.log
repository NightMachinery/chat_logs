[02:25:14] <bn_work> should be in your scrollback, you came in at the tail end of it.  anyway, I don't agree with it either & I think there are other unmentioned reasons why it's being "requested"
[02:26:03] <romainl> "requester doesn't grok the notion of distributed version control", probably
[02:27:54] <romainl> anyway, :<some_string_or_char(s)> is an "Ex command". It is introduced under :h 40.2 and further explained under :help :command
[02:27:55] <digmbot> :help 40.2 -> http://vimhelp.appspot.com/usr_40.txt.html#40%2E2 | :help :command -> http://vimhelp.appspot.com/map.txt.html#%3Acommand
[02:31:09] <romainl> For <commit_msg>, you will have to detail the desired UX: choose a preexisting message from a fixed list? type the full message? complete from existing message? etc. You almost certainly will need to grok :help user-functions for that part
[02:31:09] <digmbot> :help user-functions -> http://vimhelp.appspot.com/eval.txt.html#user-functions
[02:31:57] <romainl> sounds like a nice week-end inside
[02:34:03] <bn_work> romainl:  what does "complete from existing message" mean?  as mentioned I was hoping to have it "pre-filled" with the previous commit's message that one can easily use as a template and change
[02:34:37] <bn_work> although now that I think about it more, I'm not sure how what work as a normal Ex mode command :/
[02:34:48] <bn_work> s/what work/that would work/
[02:34:52] <romainl> doesn't
[02:35:07] <romainl> hence the completion angle

[02:36:40] <bn_work> I know the git commands to grab the last message, check if I'm on the develop branch, etc. just not too sure about the vim function side of stuff 100% (I've done some very primitive functions and am studying existing ones currently)
[02:37:08] <bn_work> romainl: is there a built-in example of that which I could study?
[02:37:13] <romainl> "save, commit, push" is more of a description of the "how". Expalined in layman terms, what is the high level goal
[02:37:41] <romainl> explained*
[02:37:49] <romainl> and ?*
[02:38:19] <bn_work> what do you mean?
[02:38:43] <romainl> I mean "What is the goal?"

[02:41:24] <bn_work> I'm trying to avoid having to have two separate workflows for git and vim.  normally (before this edict came down), I would just hack away code saving as needed and when I'm ready, `git add` or `git add -p ...`, `git commit -m ...` then `git push`
[02:41:36] <bn_work> thanks lgc
[02:42:13] <romainl> "having my expensive dental procedure financed for me so that I don't sell the car" is the goal. "Sending a letter here, an email there, then waiting and giving some phone calls" is how you reach that goal.

[04:19:11] <lgc> after 4 seconds in normal mode, Vim automatically presses the pseudo-key <CursorHold>
[04:19:19] <lgc> the CursorHold event is fired whenever this key is pressed
[04:19:24] <lgc> this 4 seconds duration is controlled by the 'updatetime' option
[04:19:29] <lgc> it is reset whenever you type something

[04:20:43] <bn_work> regardless of if anything has changed?
[04:23:55] <lgc> you might want listen to BufWritePost instead
[04:23:59] <bn_work> I would like to still control when I choose to save, ie:  I could have made a typo and it would have just committed & pushed it.  The goal was to just automate interacting with git vcs each time I save in vim
