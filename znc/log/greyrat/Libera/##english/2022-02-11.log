[02:15:09] <LjL> "sooner rather than later" sounds normal to me, while for a second I even had trouble parsing "earlier rather than later". but i'm not a native speakers.
[02:16:03] <xx> the 'earlier' version rolls off the tongue weird
[02:19:25] <TimMc> "Please make sure to read the syllabus earlier rather than later." Sounds OK to me.
[02:19:40] <TimMc> but "sooner" would be more common
[02:21:32] <LjL> as to "deal with" vs "attend to", i'd simply say the former is more colloquial and the latter is more formal... as in, you may not want to be heard saying the former *in front of* clients/customers :P

[02:24:19] <rawtaz> hi. can someone help me formulate this properly. "for the last n days which have one or more snapshots, only keep the most recent one for that day" - shouldnt it be "keep only the most recent one" instead?
[02:29:08] <TimMc> "keep only" sounds better.
[02:29:14] <rawtaz> i think so too
[02:29:51] <rawtaz> because this makes the only part be about the snapshots. if it's like in the first quote above, the only is more about the keeping being the only *action*, which is different.
[02:29:55] <TimMc> I think I like it more because it puts emphasis on the "keep" -- giving a stronger indication that the others are discarded.
[02:30:17] <TimMc> Ah, perhaps that too.
[02:30:43] <rawtaz> yeah i agree with your point there, it's a very good one and highly relevant

[02:36:31] <rawtaz> in summary instead of specifying exactly which snapshots (points in time that you made a backup of your data) you want to remove, you can say like "i want to keep a snapshot from every hour for the last week, and one snapshot per week for six months", etc

[05:34:26] <xx> I just put a comma wherever I want, seems to work just fine in English.

[05:35:41] <xx> "I observed, that many of my coworkers, that are native German writers, use too many commas, when they write English text." is that what they do?
[05:36:33] <mjacob> xx: Yes, exactly that. ;)
[05:36:50] <xx> yeah, I've seen germans do that
[05:39:20] <mjacob> xx: I’m aware that the rules for commas are more flexible in English. However, of course, it doesn’t mean that they can be put anywhere, especially where they would have been in German ( ;) ). There are also cases where it changes the meaning of a sentence (e.g. restrictive vs. nonrestrictive clauses).
[05:40:16] <xx> The rule I go by is I put a comma where I'd put an intentional pause when speaking.
[05:40:28] <twb> mjacob: I would say that you insert a comma wherever there is a "breath pause" in speech
[05:40:43] <xx> yeah, that
[05:40:51] <twb> mjacob: there are other cases (e.g. lists) but that's the case you seem to be talkign about
[05:41:07] <twb> And the best way to make people stop, is to make them read aloud the sentence
[05:42:24] <twb> For tech writing, "keep sentences short" is also a good rule of thumb.
[05:42:47] <xx> so odd that there's no ##german on here
[05:44:35] <mjacob> The “breath pause” advice is useful, but then the question is where to put breath pauses (it might not be clear to non-native speakers). ;)

[19:04:04] <Bayes> placeb0 long story short, and in totally not technical terms, you pronounce them based on whether they're in the stressed part of the speech or not. Especially vowels, that have the long vs short vs schwa sound depending on how "relevant" the syllable in the word is and how "relevant" the position of the letter in the syllable is.

[19:05:25] <placeb0> Bayes: stressed part?
[19:05:27] <TimMc> I'll give it a try after this meeting. :-)
[19:05:38] <Bayes> TimMc :D
[19:05:40] <Bayes> thanks
[19:05:53] <Bayes> placeb0 yeah, not every syllable is equally important to get the message across
[19:06:05] <placeb0> my view on how you pronounce English words is that you have to memorize all of them
[19:06:16] <Bayes> lol pretty much yes
[19:06:44] <placeb0> not very practical for foreigners
[19:06:57] <Bayes> there are rules and cheatsheets and all that that help you get there, but ultimate there's only so much you can do to get everything right
[19:07:02] <placeb0> sometimes I wonder why it is considered an easy language
[19:07:04] <huf> eh, you already have to memorize the meanings of the words
[19:07:09] <TimMc> My daughter is learning to read and it's just amazing all the different things she runs into.
[19:07:14] <huf> also the pronunciation
[19:07:16] <huf> this is just one more thing
[19:07:31] <placeb0> huf: not in all languages
[19:07:33] <huf> also, this is how all pre-literate societies worked
[19:07:36] <huf> placeb0: yes in all languages
[19:07:38] <Bayes> TimMc oh that sounds very interesting, the struggles of a native speaker
[19:07:51] <huf> placeb0: how would you know how to spell them otherwise?
[19:07:55] <huf> you have to remember *something*
[19:08:02] <TimMc> She can read words like "pronunciation" just fine, but the other day she was struggling with "thoroughly".
[19:08:05] <placeb0> huf: in greek we have tones, you pronounce a word depending on where the tone sits
[19:08:13] <placeb0> in which letter I mean
[19:08:16] <huf> yeah, so?
[19:08:22] <TimMc> And "education", recently.
[19:08:22] <huf> you still have to remember how to pronounce the word
[19:08:31] <Bayes> huf hey no, some languages make spelling -> pronunciation easier
[19:08:31] <placeb0> no..
[19:08:34] <huf> Bayes: sure
[19:08:42] <placeb0> why would you need to remember that?
[19:08:48] <huf> Bayes: but to go the other way, you have to remember the word
[19:08:50] <placeb0> you just put the tone
[19:09:08] <Bayes> TimMc thoroughly is quite a big chunk tbf, what about education does she struggle with?
[19:09:11] <TimMc> placeb0: Because most of the things you say out loud are not things you're reading off a page.
[19:09:39] <Bayes> TimMc if you don't mind the question
[19:09:40] <huf> Bayes: even there it can be tricky, because a completely phonetic spelling is just not desirable
[19:09:56] <placeb0> TimMc: but when you learn a language you start by reading off a page 
[19:10:04] <huf> lol no
[19:10:11] <huf> that's not how you learn a language in any sane situation
[19:10:11] <TimMc> placeb0: For a second language, maybe.
[19:10:24] <TimMc> placeb0: Not your first language.
[19:10:25] <huf> even for a second language, you start by repeating stuff the teacher says while pointing at pictures
[19:10:30] <huf> cos you're a small child
[19:10:32] <huf> (ideally)
[19:10:34] <placeb0> I'm talking about second language
[19:10:50] <placeb0> kids obviously learn to talk first
[19:11:07] <TimMc> Bayes: She was saying "eduction". Might be because of the weird sound the "du" makes.
[19:11:30] <TimMc> -dgyu-
[19:11:45] <huf> isnt it just a j?
[19:11:50] <huf> or are you the soft d type of person?
[19:12:07] <TimMc> edge-you
[19:12:20] <TimMc> rather than ed-you, yeah
[19:12:45] <huf> that soft d thing some english speakers do is very close to our gy in "magyar" :)
[19:12:53] <huf> which is a sound even those english speakers struggle with :D
[19:12:57] <Bayes> TimMc dang that's a pretty tough one now that you make me think of it... ed-you is what I tend to go with, is that not the natural AmE pronunciation?

[19:13:16] <TimMc> Probably varies regionally.
[19:13:20] <noStory> english are bad
[19:13:33] <huf> yes yes, perfidious albion and all that
[19:14:15] <Bayes> dang I'm even doubting among ed-you, edge-you, edə (as the u in faculty)
[19:14:55] <TimMc> But I think she also tries to read too quickly, and misses letters sometimes.
[19:15:03] <huf> that can happen
[19:15:13] <TimMc> She's at the point where she can sort of skim-read but then makes a lot of bad guesses. :-)
[19:15:25] <huf> I read all of the jf cooper indian books through before I realized I had misread the main indian guy's name
[19:15:31] <TimMc> e.g. she often gets short words wrong because she just jumps over them
[19:15:40] <huf> to be fair, it was csingacsguk
[19:15:42] <huf> which is a motherfucker to read
[19:15:47] <Bayes> sounds better than what I do xD which is a bit too close to analysis paralysis for my taste

[19:19:06] <kompowiec> <placeb0> sometimes I wonder why it is considered an easy language
[19:19:08] <Bayes> education [ˌejəˈkāSH(ə)n] what is that eh-you ?
[19:19:11] <kompowiec> because you can use rote learning
[19:19:16] <huf> nah
[19:19:24] <huf> it's considered an easy language for two main reasons
[19:19:30] <huf> 1) lots of resources easily available
[19:19:38] <Bayes> 3) history is written by the victors
[19:19:38] <huf> 2) people are fucking stupid and think there are easier and harder languages
[19:19:48] <huf> and you cant beat this idiocy out of them
[19:19:50] <huf> not that we try
[19:20:05] <placeb0> kompowiec: what does thay mean?
[19:20:30] <huf> there's a faint 3 that if you speak an IE language or are immersed in western culture, you already know some of the words
[19:20:51] <pussipupu> there are easier languages, it's the ones you grew up with
[19:21:00] <huf> :)
[19:21:09] <pussipupu> including prenatally, such whilst not surprising is a fact I love
[19:21:42] <placeb0> huf: that's stupid for many reasons, but the most important one is the fact that native English speakers are more likely to not know a second language than anyone else
[19:21:48] <pussipupu> I can occasionally kinda get meaning from Sami and Estonian speech
[19:22:14] <pussipupu> For a non-PIE example
[19:22:14] <huf> placeb0: hm?
[19:22:18] <huf> placeb0: and?
[19:22:49] <huf> imperial core subjects dont need to learn a foreign language to prosper? and so they dont?
[19:22:52] <huf> I am shocked.
[19:23:21] <placeb0> native English speakers shouldn't really blame learners for being stupid especially if themselves have not ever gone through learning a second language
[19:23:35] <huf> what are you even talking about?

[19:24:37] <huf> oh wow, the original title of "the red pirate" is "the red rover"?
[19:24:38] <huf> ow.
[19:24:45] <placeb0> the fact that you think the reason people may find English hard is the fact that they are fucking stupid
[19:24:49] <huf> it's the better word for "red" too
[19:24:56] <huf> placeb0: learn to read
[19:25:02] <huf> nowhere did I say that
[19:25:46] <placeb0> scroll up on your 2) reason
[19:26:57] <pussipupu> English orthography might be harder to learn than more recently (re) standardised ones
[19:27:42] <pussipupu> their point 2 was calling those who rank languages by difficulty stupid, not people learning English as a second language
[19:28:45] <placeb0> one doesn't exclude the other 
[19:29:43] <pussipupu> They're different claims though

[19:29:48] <placeb0> you have to learn a second language in order to be able to rate one as harder than the other
[19:29:49] <TimMc> huf: Spanish is totally easier than English.
[19:29:57] <pussipupu> And one doesn't imply the other
[19:30:18] <noStory> english are many .
[19:30:21] <pussipupu> Finnish might be an easy language to me

[19:30:36] *** Joins: treflip (~user@95.79.32.99)
[19:30:43] <pussipupu> though I still struggle because I'm a stupid person
[19:32:03] <placeb0> easy part about English is the lack of verb forms and gendered words 
[19:32:34] <placeb0> though at the same time the way a verb is modified depending on tense is a tricky part
[19:33:09] <noStory> placeb0 say English-written
[19:33:12] <pussipupu> The inflexion is pretty irregular though
[19:33:32] <pussipupu> And we don't use distinct forms for different parts of speech, which I suspect adds confusion for learners
[19:34:02] <placeb0> for me the harder part is the lack of rules 
[19:34:19] <TimMc> I haven't found the grammatical gender in Spanish to be a major impediment.
[19:34:24] <noStory> spoken english here is was wasted . cant understand what hollywood movies and foreigners speak
[19:34:24] <pussipupu> There are more rules than are generally apparent
[19:34:37] <placeb0> it's fine to have irregular inflexion as long as there's a reason for that
[19:34:39] <TimMc> I just learn each word with its article.
[19:34:46] <pussipupu> It's more that there are many categories with their own rules than that there aren't rules
[19:34:52] <noStory> ^learnt here wasted
[19:34:56] <noStory> Z
[19:34:58] <noStory> BYE
[19:35:14] <pussipupu> The reason is often etymological
[19:35:32] <TimMc> I don't learn "calle", I learn "la calle".
[19:35:42] <placeb0> pussipupu: but what puts certain words in a category?
[19:35:56] <pussipupu> Their history, often
[19:36:06] <placeb0> I get there's irregular verbs, but there's no obvious reason for the to be irregular
[19:36:30] <pussipupu> So it's not necessarily something you can know from simply seeing or hearing the word, unless you recognise the root
