[03:34:58] <_inky> I just asked to excuse myself on the other channel that i come for short time and leave for long.
[03:35:51] <_inky> yes, my grandfather was a genocide survivor. i don't want to talk about this so much... but  because the theme was mentioned, i am not sure that the state is always bad.
[03:36:12] <_inky> you remember genocide of yazidis several years ago? they did not have their own state and army to defend them.
[03:36:47] <_inky> armenians in ottoman empire did not have own state or army to defend them. or to be able to defend themselves in an organized way.
[03:37:08] <_inky> Joanna: leviathan is the state.
[03:37:15] <_inky> it's from the book...
[03:37:41] <_inky> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leviathan_(Hobbes_book)
[03:38:38] <_inky> the state got the monopoly of violence. therefore nobody allowed violence except the state. state punishen violence. that was one of the main reasons behind the decrease of violence.
[03:41:56] *** Joins: shibboleth (~shibbolet@user/shibboleth)
[03:44:52] <Joanna> Hi _inky I’ve known someone whose grandmother somehow survived the genocide. Wasn’t it because ottomans were fighting Russians and considered Armenians russian allies or was it just a pretext?
[03:46:56] <Joanna> In any case the violence that the state can perform can be worse in many cases that violence from peers. I guess it’s all fine and good until the state decides that the group you are part of needs to die
[03:52:04] *** Quits: Malvolio (~Malvolio@user/malvolio) (Quit: nemo mortalium omnibus horis sapit)
[03:52:07] <_inky> it was one of the pretexts, i guess.
[03:53:41] <Joanna> I don’t know much about Ottoman Empire apart from the british were eager to destroy it.
[03:53:56] <_inky> i sincerely respect the untrust towards the government. state must be controlled by people. still, i believe currently it is the case that we are today more protected from each other than without the government.
[03:53:57] <_inky> also
[03:54:18] <_inky> if we come back to yazidi example
[03:54:36] <_inky> imagine all the people in the world are living in small communities without the state.
[03:54:54] <_inky> then the isis like structure emerges. what would you do? we all become helpless like yazidis.
[03:55:24] <_inky> we cannot guarantee that isis will not appear.
[03:56:07] <_inky> british was also eager to support it, and they support it today. i've heard there is even no 'armenian genocide' article in british encyclopedia, because it is not aligned with their politics.
[03:56:15] <_inky> so depends on time.
[03:57:36] <Joanna> Did the british have something to do with Armenian genocide?
[03:59:52] *** Quits: shibboleth (~shibbolet@user/shibboleth) (Quit: shibboleth)
[04:00:07] <_inky> not that i know of.
[04:00:53] <_inky> but germany at the time provided some limited and negligeble support to ottoman empire.
[04:01:21] <Joanna> Safety is kind of like comparing animals in wild to animals on a farm. Sure farm animals are safe from predators except the ultimate predator who is the farmer who can kill them at any moment. Why do you think british would lie about the genocide?
[04:01:37] <_inky> so i believe in state. also, you know, i represent the ethnicity which lived not their best times without the state. in the states they were considered almost foreigners, though they were living on the lands their ancestors lived.
[04:02:04] <Joanna> Ottomans and Germans were allies in ww1 I think?
[04:02:21] <_inky> in ottoman empire they did not have right to own a horse, to have a house which is more than one floor high, they were almost wrong in the courts because courts would decide in favour of muslim.
[04:02:27] <_inky> the problem mostly was the religion.
[04:02:34] <_inky> not exactly the ethnicity. most of the times.
[04:02:43] <_inky> yes.
[04:03:13] <_inky> this is from wiki:
[04:03:13] <_inky> >The German Empire was a military ally of the Ottoman Empire during World War I.[239] German diplomats approved limited removals of Armenians in early 1915, and took no action against the genocide,[240][241] which has been a source of controversy.[239][242]
[04:04:00] <_inky> many armenians were migrating to russian empire, because well, they weren't as much humiliated there.
[04:04:16] <Joanna> So you could say if the government is denying you rights now there is a good chance they might just decide to eliminate you later if it strikes their fancy
[04:04:23] <_inky> and because russia controlled other part of historical armenia.
[04:04:57] <_inky> so though there was time russia banned armenian church and schools, we must understand that only on the part that was closer to russia, armenians still live.
[04:06:00] <_inky> i am saying that though i do not approve many things israel does, i understand the desire of jewish people to have own state.
[04:06:01] <Joanna> Russians and Armenians are both Eastern Orthodox aren’t they ?
[04:06:16] <_inky> well, related orthodox, but not the same.
[04:06:29] <_inky> georgians and russians and greek are the same.
[04:06:45] <Joanna> I believe that Israel is a client state of Britain
[04:07:08] <_inky> armenians were not participating the... i don't know the exact english terms, the great cosmic meeting in around 500 because they were busy with some wars.
[04:07:16] <_inky> and the deviation of the church started there.
[04:07:41] <Joanna> It’s certainly closer than Islam
[04:07:47] <_inky> britain was preventing israeli settlers to enter the territory at the time.
[04:07:51] <_inky> so everything change with time.
[04:08:06] <_inky> islael got a lot of support from ussr in the beginning. but later became almost an enemy state.
[04:08:10] <Joanna> But they changed their minds after the war
[04:08:47] <_inky> armenian church is closer to russian orthodox than to catolics.
[04:08:53] <_inky> but there are armenian catolics.
[04:09:07] <Joanna> I didn’t know Russia helped Israel.
[04:09:31] <_inky> yes, you can check it out. but only at first.
[04:09:39] <Joanna> Is that what inspired the kibbutzim?
[04:10:07] <_inky> soviet russia in eary days helped turkey because turkey was presenting itself as on the way to become a communist state.
[04:10:30] <_inky> no, but many early settlers were leftists.
[04:10:38] <_inky> and believed in socialism.
[04:10:41] <Joanna> I think Russia still sells weapons to Turkey?
[04:11:30] <_inky> well, russia formally is a 'strategic alley' of armenia, but they sell weapons both to armenia and azerbaijan. knowing that the weapons will be used against their 'alley'.
[04:11:48] <_inky> ally actually. let me turn the spell checker on.
[04:12:42] <Joanna> Back to what we were discussing before if a government can curtail your right to own a horse or a two story house they can also curtail your right to be alive. Most people don’t understand how fast things can escalate.
[04:13:26] <_inky> also armenia is a member of russian lead nato like, but actually i would say, warsaw pact like organization.
[04:14:06] <Joanna> It seems similar to the us orchestrated iran Iraq war
[04:14:49] <Joanna> Then it later destroyed Iraq and would like to destroy Iran as soon as it can
[04:14:55] <_inky> in theory it has to defend us, but in practice, when  last year some internationally recognized armenian territory was occupied by our neighbours, and we made an official request to that organization, i think 'csto' in english, people say, putin just called and asked to not use paper requests anymore. and no help followed of course.
[04:15:01] <_inky> it indeed seems similar.
[04:15:05] <_inky> looks similar.
[04:15:45] <_inky> this 'csto' has very troubling points in the agreement.
[04:15:49] <Joanna> The Russians are probably trying to control both sides
[04:15:57] <_inky> surely.
[04:16:18] <_inky> let's say they 'defend' not only from the outside thread, but from inside 'rebellions'. 
[04:16:36] <_inky> i remember how that 'update' to the 'user agreement' came, and how our previous corrupted gov signed it.
[04:17:15] <_inky> and we all commented it, like they will support our corrupted but loyal leaders even with military force.
[04:17:39] <Joanna> For many years I played an online game and I noticed that once a group of players got rid of all enemies they would destroy their own group
[04:17:56] <_inky> luckily, and also because of very peaceful way armenian revolution happened, and also because armenia has no feasible way to not be russian hostage, no such measure followed.
[04:18:17] <_inky> but that point of agreement was used recently when kazakhstan president asked csto to send military.
[04:19:17] <_inky> if we all in region were more clever and realistic, we would agree on solving our problems, and we would cooperate
[04:19:28] <_inky> which would make us more independent from big powers.
[04:19:52] <Joanna> You don’t really have a chance of being independent you will either be absorbed by Russians or genocided by people who just want your land.
[04:20:06] <_inky> but unfortunately we were unable to do so neither in the beginning of 20th century when we gained short independence and then got swallowed by soviet russia, nor now.
[04:20:35] <_inky> Joanna: unfortunately that's what was happening for last 1000 years. (:
[04:20:52] <Joanna> That’s the way it’s always been warring tribes get bigger and less diverse
[04:21:53] <_inky> still, Assirians don't have a state anymore, but we still have our small state. 
[04:22:04] <_inky> and this small state i would say also prevented the genocide in 2020.
[04:22:48] <_inky> during the 44 days war. though we basically lost, but there was an army, badly organized, but an army.
[04:23:02] <Joanna> What stopped them from just invading and killing everyone?
[04:23:34] <_inky> well... such a heavy topic.
[04:23:34] <Joanna> If they beat your army couldn’t they take everything?
[04:23:57] <_inky> sigh. first of all
[04:24:17] <_inky> i think 44 days is a lot, taking in consideration the difference in military spendings.
[04:24:24] <Joanna> They took a large portion?maybe in future they will take more like the Americans manifest destiny
[04:24:31] <_inky> also they had turkish support and some jihadists from syria.
[04:24:49] <_inky> so resisting for 44 days was not as bad.
[04:25:51] <_inky> eventually the paper was signed to stop, and russians were already prepared and sent their 'peacekeeper' troops.
[04:26:03] <_inky> that was what they wanted for many years.
[04:26:22] <Joanna> It definitely helps to have a military but what stopped the invasion?
[04:26:28] <_inky> so i don't want conspiracies, but well, it made sense to sell weapons to both parties, eventually they got what they wanted.
[04:26:48] <_inky> i sincerely don't have the information. that's the question we are asking ourselves.
[04:26:59] <Joanna> Ah the Russians did the invasion
[04:28:26] * Roey invades the conversation
[04:28:28] <Roey> Hello!!!
[04:28:30] <_inky> when they took about the half of land they wanted, three sides, together with putin, signed the agreement. armenia left some more land without the war, and russia brought its military to 'separate sides' on some small piece of remaining land.
[04:28:33] <Roey> How's everyone?
[04:28:39] <Joanna> Hi Roey
[04:28:43] <Roey> hey hey Joanna!
[04:29:10] <Roey> & hi too, _inky :)
[04:29:35] <Joanna> _inky: what did Russia want before the war from Armenia?
[04:29:35] <_inky> so now they can say that they saved the people. and though they sold the weapons and contributed to the situation, they are also in part telling the truth. they stopped it as well. probably. but they were not able to stop it earlier.
[04:29:40] <_inky> hello, Roey.
[04:29:54] <Roey> question is, did the Russians end up using Chef or Ansible? Or something entirely different?
[04:30:07] <Roey> BANF
[04:30:18] *** Quits: XV8 (~XV8@2601:5cb:c001:50:74f2:29a5:c6ca:a36e) (Quit: Textual IRC Client: www.textualapp.com)
[04:30:28] <_inky> in short they wanted to put their military to the region, as peacekeeping force.
[04:30:52] <_inky> and practically control with military the disputed territory.
[04:31:42] <_inky> their military was always in armenia. they did not leave. actually we asked them to stay. because we have turkey nearby.
[04:32:06] <_inky> when they were leaving in 90ies we asked them to stay and have a military base.
[04:32:09] <Joanna> Has Armenia had any revolutions like Ukraine funded by western ngos?
[04:32:24] <_inky> i am certain that no.
[04:32:55] <_inky> we had a revolution, but even after the revolution, the new government tries to stay in best and close possible relations with russia.
[04:33:33] <_inky> and we don't do what americans ask. let's say they ask to not be close with iran. we tell them no. it's our neighbour for thousands of years, we cannot do that.
[04:33:36] <Joanna> If if wasn’t for russian military you might have been taken over by Azeri and Turkish
[04:34:17] <_inky> well, practically yes. turkey was almost safe in 90ies, they had much more sane government than today.
[04:34:28] <Joanna> I heard there was a failed attempt to do something in Armenia by the west
[04:35:27] <_inky> you know, some areas in russia have a paranoia. they support corrupted regimes in their sattelites, and when those regimes get endangered, they use all their media to represent every threat to those corruptioners as the western coup.
[04:35:41] <_inky> sometimes it is really comic.
[04:36:00] <_inky> for example i think in 2015 we had 'electric yerevan' protests, and that was about electricity prices.
[04:36:04] <_inky> nothing really political.
[04:36:19] <Joanna> Maybe Russia and the west really are fighting over control
[04:36:20] <_inky> so russian media portrayed it as western influence and as proof they showed a photo
[04:36:30] <_inky> of armenian police arresting a black man.
[04:36:45] <_inky> well, not arresting, but police and a black man.
[04:37:07] <_inky> and they were saying like 'see there are black protesters in armenia, they were sent there by west'
[04:37:23] <_inky> and it was really comic situation, but russian auditory believed it.
[04:37:27] <_inky> and you know what was the photo?
[04:37:35] <Joanna> The way color revolutions work is they look for discontent and exploit it for their own benefit
[04:38:05] <_inky> so the kim kardashian came to armenia with back then husband  kanye west. like a year before the protest.
[04:38:09] <Joanna> What was causing the high electricity costs?
[04:38:48] <_inky> and kanye made a performance in the park, and then he threw himself in to the small lake.
[04:39:00] <_inky> and then people rushed to him to ask to sign sometthing
[04:39:25] <_inky> and then police was sort of surrounding him and they took him out of tthat place
[04:39:48] <_inky> so that photo was used by russian propaganda to portray the protest as western organized.
[04:40:14] <_inky> they just cannot understand that people can be unhappy because of corruption an thieves.
[04:40:31] <Joanna> NGOs do spend a lot of money destabilizing and taking over governments
[04:40:39] <_inky> and today it is very much visible. let's say the thing which everyone sees - are the roads. 
[04:41:52] <Joanna> What about railroads?
[04:42:19] <_inky> well, what you say sounds like russian propaganda. i tell you, they have a paranoia about it. ngo's are doing great job by monitoring the state, and that is one of the ways that helps society to keep control of the government.
[04:42:34] <_inky> you agree that the state should be controlled by the people? what are the tools? so ngo's are the tools.
[04:42:38] <_inky> in particular.
[04:43:17] <_inky> we don't have railroads because we are blocked by turkey and azerbaijan, and the other railroad goes to georgia but via abkhazia, but abkhazia is actually occupied by russia so georgia has no rail connection with them.
[04:43:19] <_inky> so no railroad.
[04:43:20] <_inky> (:
[04:44:35] <_inky> so we are the example of the revolution which changed nothing. actually after the revolution we got the leader who was much closer with russia than any other leady in the history of last armenian state for 30 years.
[04:44:57] <_inky> and americans were very unhappy of us sending troops to syria together with russians.
[04:45:13] <Joanna> NGOs are working for the benefit of the governments the represent
[04:45:44] <_inky> well our troops were only 'humanitarian': doctors and sappers.
[04:46:07] <Joanna> Doesn’t Armenia have local railroads around towns ?
[04:46:19] <_inky> but still. that did not make usa happy. armenia almost votes for russia in un. that often makes me embarrased.
[04:46:35] <_inky> because we vote together with zimbabwe and other like countries. not a very cool company.
[04:46:41] <_inky> but we have no other choice.
[04:47:16] <_inky> yes, local railroads. in concession to russia, given years ago by corruptioners.
[04:47:37] <Joanna> Us would like to have control of Armenia so it can cause trouble for Iran and Russia most likely
[04:48:02] <_inky> the electricity crisis was because the russian backed company had overspending and they stole a lot of money. then they said well, because we don't know where are our money, you should pay with increased prices.
[04:48:44] <_inky> US actually knows very well they have no chances. I would like them to have chances. But unfortunately we cannot afford it. And they are actually not as interested.
[04:48:54] <_inky> They have Turkey, and they have Georgia.
[04:50:32] <_inky> And they don't really need us. They know we have no options.
[04:51:33] <_inky> People just want to not be robbed. Today they feel they aren't.
[04:51:40] <Joanna> I know it’s not fun to have high electricity prices but it’s sort of a blessing in disguise do not be as dependent upon cheap electricity. I bet your buildings are built properly there with windows that open ?
[04:51:52] <_inky> Can you imagine, after the lost war and 4000 dead soldiers the current government, which came after revolution
[04:51:58] <_inky> again won during the elections?
[04:52:17] <_inky> because people feel they aren't robbed now. and that the situation is more sane. that nobody robbs small business.
[04:52:46] <_inky> we had so "50% sashik" who was the brother of the former president. he had to own 50% of every more or less good business.
[04:52:55] <_inky> not it's over. everybody feels the freedom.
[04:53:25] <_inky> nobody wants corruption. now all the media which is still controlled by former guys because they still have a lot of money, criticizes the goverment as they can.
[04:53:32] <_inky> that's a freedom of speech and we enjoy it.
[04:53:48] <_inky> we did not have that luxury before. nobody was criticizing the gov in news papers. in same papers.
[04:54:14] <_inky> and not every revolution means 'the hand of the west'. people just want a bit more freedom.
[04:54:42] <_inky> and they got the freedom. and newly elected government, first thing went to moscow and assured their loyalty.
[04:54:55] <_inky> so protest doesn't mean usa. protest means people are pissed off of the situation.
[04:54:58] <Joanna> How about freedom of movement and freedom from taxation though?
[04:55:35] <_inky> that's an absolutely different topic. our task was to have taxation. because before the revolution
[04:55:47] <_inky> taxes were used as means of pressuring 'not friends'
[04:55:57] <_inky> and oligarchs were practically freed of taxes. 
[04:56:01] <_inky> they market was divided.
[04:56:19] <_inky> this oligarch has a monopoly of sugar and bananas. (: that one the other monopoly.
[04:56:26] <_inky> and they had to be loyal to the gov.
[04:56:53] <_inky> now they all pay taxes. that is also why we are able to repair the roads, increase salaries of military and teachers and medical workers.
[04:57:09] <_inky> because these people actually started to get taxed.
[04:57:17] <_inky> so in our case taxes are good, we did not have those.
[04:57:18] <_inky> (:
[04:57:25] <Joanna> It’s often hard to tell who is paying taxes and who isn’t
[04:57:36] <_inky> well i can tell you in details.
[04:58:04] <Joanna> In the us billionaires don’t pay taxes but poor folks do
[04:58:54] <_inky> what about freedom of movement? you mean covid situation?
[04:59:41] <_inky> so there was a ministry of health decision that if you are not vaccinated and you work in service, like in cafeteria or you are a seller, you need to be vaccinated or to present pcr test results every two weeks.
[04:59:57] <_inky> the constitutional court ruled out it is not constitutional so it got reverted.
[05:00:07] <Joanna> Are you allowed to go anywhere you like without permission? With the exception of strangers private homes where your not welcome of course?
[05:00:16] <_inky> so we did not see something like that before. the gov decides, everyone agrees.
[05:00:21] <_inky> now the situation is much better.
[05:00:39] <_inky> what kind of permissions are you talking about?
[05:00:44] <_inky> i don't understand you.
[05:01:26] <_inky> i cannot go only to territories occupied during 2020 war.
[05:01:46] <_inky> otherwise i was traveling a lot and i continue to travel a lot inside the country. it is small so it is very easy.
[05:01:47] <Joanna> Can you walk out of your house and go anywhere you like anytime you like without showing documents? If the answer is no you are not free.
[05:02:13] <_inky> oh, even during soviet rule, when everyone officially was required to have a passport with them, nobody followed that rule.
[05:02:26] <_inky> i don't know if we have such a rule today, but nobody has documents with themselves.
[05:02:31] <_inky> it's  a small society.
[05:02:53] <_inky> well, the drivers have a driver license.
[05:03:40] <Joanna> So how do they know if your vaxxed then ?
[05:03:48] <_inky> who?
[05:04:03] <_inky> i just told you - the ministry of health had a decision that employers sholud require
[05:04:09] <_inky> from employees (some employers only)
[05:04:19] <_inky> the vax certificate or pcr test every two weeks.
[05:04:28] <Joanna> You can’t go to work without permission from a higher authority
[05:04:34] <_inky> then the constitutional court ruled that decision is not constitutional.
[05:04:47] <_inky> so that rule is not working here.
[05:05:05] <Joanna> So you don’t have vax passports there ?
[05:05:29] <_inky> i don't know what is vax passport, exactly. but it is not required.
[05:05:53] <_inky> they want to make such a requirement now. the ministry of health. then people again will sue them and we'll see what constitutional court will do.
[05:06:11] <_inky> for now what they wanted to do was considered anti constitutional by the court so they were not able to.
[05:06:20] <_inky> this is democracy at work. division of powers.
[05:07:08] <_inky> i only did pcr test when i went to georgia recently. there i was showing a paper when entering some places.
[05:07:25] <_inky> actually all places in georgia had to require the paper, but most of the small places ignored the requirement.
[05:07:35] <_inky> i never used such paper in armenia.
[05:08:30] <_inky> it's not that i am very much confident that democracy here is stable.
[05:08:41] <_inky> in political theory there is a 'huntington's test'.
[05:09:03] <_inky> it says if the country had a switch in power via election and without violence, three times, then probably
[05:09:07] <Joanna> Well for the time being I’m glad for you having freedom don’t let it go away for any reason
[05:09:11] <_inky> it will remain democratic afterwards.
[05:09:17] <_inky> we did not pass it. it is a hard test to pass.
[05:10:39] <_inky> we had a lockdown in march 2020. government had no resources to enforce it. also the economy suffered a lot, so the government needs money, and needs economic growth. they won't do a lockdown anymore. they were very frightened in the beginning though.
[05:11:00] <Joanna> Not all elections really work as democracy maybe it is better there because country is so small
[05:11:05] <_inky> frightened of ddos of hospitals and of covid.
[05:11:25] <_inky> you know, the systems usa and european countries have are a blessing for countries like ours.
[05:11:41] <_inky> those systems have own problems, of course.
[05:11:41] <Joanna> Are you able to understand spoken English?
[05:11:46] <_inky> but we need to grow to have those problems.
[05:11:54] <_inky> i think very well.
[05:12:33] <Joanna> Have you listened to the Corbett podcast? The link is in topic
[05:12:34] <_inky> i watch movies in english, i watch online videos in english, i have foreign friends.
[05:12:43] <_inky> i'll listen. thank you!
[05:12:58] <_inky> there was internet privacy guy before. i was following him.
[05:13:03] <Joanna> He is my favorite journalist I just discovered recently
[05:13:24] <_inky> i braxman is still here.
[05:13:28] <Joanna> I’m going backwards from most recent podcasts
[05:13:29] <_inky> s/i/ah/
[05:14:09] <_inky> i would like to repeat: i understand the problems western societies have. but we have to grow up to reach that level to have such problems.
[05:14:23] <Joanna> He also has videos with same content as podcasts
[05:15:14] <Joanna> He talks a lot about current affairs I’ve learned a lot of things I didn’t know about
[05:15:44] <_inky> also, when you didn't have a state for 1000 years, and you were one of the most humiliated and discriminated in other states, you start to value having own state.
[05:16:32] <_inky> you start to value that you are able to write a thesis in own language. that you have political debates in your language. which means your language is not a second or third category language.
[05:16:45] <Joanna> It’s amazing that you have survived as a people
[05:17:07] <_inky> and you know, by the way, i don't remember that usa would require to make english as an official in georgia or ukraine.
[05:17:29] <_inky> but russia always requires to make russian as an official in the states they want to control.
[05:18:12] <_inky> we can send military to syria, we can vote with zimbabwe, but that's one thing we are still able to resist.
[05:19:03] <Joanna> Japanese is slowly beings changed into English and English is required course in Japanese schools
[05:19:05] <_inky> without the state the language doesn't work.
[05:19:33] <_inky> armenians in syria use it only in kitchen. it's not a language of journalists, language of politicians or language to write a scientific paper.
[05:19:57] <_inky> russian is a required course in armenian schools.
[05:19:59] <Joanna> I think maybe the us just wants to control countries but Russia wants to assimilate “
[05:20:16] <_inky> plus some third language. since ussr times that can be german, french, english.
[05:20:57] <_inky> you know, georgia actually is doing very well by being good with usa. we cannot afford it but i would like to do well.
[05:21:08] <_inky> usa helped georgia to fire all the old corrupted police
[05:21:10] <Joanna> If you don’t learn a language when young it’s much less likely to be good at it.
[05:21:23] <_inky> and they taught new police. usa helped to create new strong institutions and policies.
[05:21:43] <_inky> and today it is very easy to invest to georgia, and each time you have to deal with the state, it is really easy and fast.
[05:21:51] <Joanna> Do you know how much crime the us has ?
[05:21:52] <_inky> we don't have that luxury.
[05:21:59] <_inky> so what we do is very slow reforms.
[05:22:28] <_inky> well, what kind of crime? i know that crime in the streets is not much less than in 90ies.
[05:22:33] <Joanna> Didn’t they put bioweapons labs I. Georgia?
[05:23:05] <_inky> (btw it is almost 6AM now here, so my english mistakes are also because i lack computational power now)
[05:23:17] <_inky> i don't know.
[05:23:22] <Joanna> Well the us leads the world in prison population so
[05:23:57] <_inky> what i see is that georgia was a very corrupted country. with fat policemen, who would force you to give them bribes.
[05:24:03] <_inky> that business was pressured by the government.
[05:24:05] <Joanna> They are not experts in crime prevention I’ll say
[05:24:11] <_inky> and not it looks like a free country.
[05:24:21] <_inky> so you know usa actually has very good influence. (:
[05:24:36] <_inky> or don't you agree that taiwan is doing much better than if it were under control of mainland china?
[05:24:47] <Joanna> Taxes and extortion from police are kind of similar
[05:24:58] <_inky> or south korea vs north korea.
[05:25:01] <_inky> or west vs east germany?
[05:25:22] <_inky> well i tried to explain why taxes are important to us today.
[05:25:55] <_inky> also tax money mean piece of bread for the soldier, and the gun. literally.
[05:26:07] <_inky> and that money was robbed. i can tell you about my time in the army.
[05:26:23] <_inky> and the soup with the two leafes of cabbage in the water.
[05:26:26] <Joanna> I’ve never visited mainland china. I liked some things about Taiwan but two things I didn’t like. The motor scooters and the way people had gotten dogs on a whim and later abandoned them
[05:26:52] <_inky> now it's not like that. because again: taxes. that actually go to the state.
[05:27:12] <_inky> you live in japan now, but you used to live in usa, right?
[05:27:59] <ilikeyou> scooters are everywhere here now. it
[05:28:02] <ilikeyou> it
[05:28:09] <ilikeyou> its annoying
[05:28:12] <_inky> in china many don't know about the tyananmin massacre and many just afraid to mention it.
[05:28:21] <Joanna> I’m not against people contributing to make things work but when you pay taxes you have no control over what money is spent on. And as a result it gets spent on some very bad things
[05:28:22] <_inky> in china you have the worst nightmare of people like you.
[05:28:37] <_inky> the state controls everything. every movement. in big cities there are cameras everywhere.
[05:28:45] <_inky> and you have that social ranking system.
[05:28:58] <_inky> if you buy more alcohol than suggested by the state, your rank goes down.
[05:29:16] <_inky> if you say something to the neighbour, not only online, your rank goes down.
[05:29:35] <_inky> then you don't get the visa to travel to other country as a punishment, or you cannot get job, it depends.
[05:29:36] <Joanna> There is a good chance that the tianamen square thing was a failed coup by western ngos
[05:30:27] <_inky> omg, why are people having paranoia about western ngo's? chinese people would be much happier living in a free country. or let's say in a country as free as usa, than in a country as free as current china.
[05:30:33] <_inky> so let me wish freedom to china.
[05:31:10] <_inky> sincerely, some things are really hard to explain.
[05:31:14] <Joanna> The irony of it is is that only oppressive governments don’t get taken over by coups orchestrated by outsiders. I wish it wasn’t that way.
[05:31:23] <_inky> i think it's because people have a fixed scale for feelings.
[05:31:34] <_inky> let's say i would meet my german or american friend
[05:31:40] <Joanna> Have you actually visited China? I have not
[05:31:54] <_inky> and i would tell them how frustrated am i about the freedom of speech situation in armenia.
[05:32:04] <_inky> and they would tell me 'it is the same in usa/germany'
[05:32:07] <_inky> no it is not the same.
[05:32:13] <_inky> it cannot be the same.
[05:32:18] <_inky> that is the problem.
[05:32:27] <Joanna> I have met some people from China but they never mentioned their country being horrible.
[05:32:35] <_inky> but i understand that they feel bad about their gov on the same scale as bad as i about my gov.
[05:32:40] <_inky> so they cannot objectively compare.
[05:32:52] <_inky> well of course, they don't have other sources of informaiton.
[05:33:09] <_inky> ussr people also were thinking they live in the most fair country in the world.
[05:33:27] <Joanna> The chinese were in the us but I didn’t think to ask them at the time
[05:33:30] <_inky> and were ready, many of them were ready to write a claim that their neighbour did a joke about the gov.
[05:33:42] <_inky> and the the neighbour would be taken to gulag and would die there.
[05:34:00] <_inky> because they were believing they are doing a good job by telling the gov about the 'enemies of the state'.
[05:34:06] <_inky> and they were proud of their state.
[05:34:20] <_inky> i saw a dw documentary on north korea. they are so proud of their state.
[05:35:22] <_inky> i am sorry, i have a work in about 3 hours. will try to sleep.
[05:35:39] <JimBuntu> Hrm. Last person I worked with for a while who was directly from China said their country of China was terrible. They may have been trying to make me feel better, unsure. I know they left because after reaching a certain level of schooling they didn't think it was safe to ever return. They now work on experimental nuclear power generation methods in the States with the DOE/DOD/etc
[05:35:48] <_inky> i have three jobs now. our gdp is not great. and i need some money.
[05:36:23] <Joanna> In the us you can insult the puppet politicians all you like but you better not disparage the things that matter. I’ve never had freedom of speech my entire life. There are always consequences if you say wrong thing to wrong person. Freedom of speech only exists among friends subordinates or yelling where nobody can hear you
[05:36:45] <_inky> consequences are different, Joanna.
[05:36:48] <_inky> that's what i am saying.
[05:37:02] <JimBuntu> Freedom of speech is literally protections from laws and government, never about consequences outside of that.
[05:37:03] <_inky> have all your family been taken to gulag because of what you've said? 
[05:37:08] <_inky> did you all cut trees?
[05:37:11] <_inky> and die in the snow?
[05:37:14] <_inky> in siberia?
[05:37:34] <_inky> or well, that was a good scenario.
[05:37:48] <_inky> because the other one was a death sentence right away.
[05:38:33] <JimBuntu> I wonder. How many people leave their home country to move to China and become Chinese.
[05:38:52] <Joanna> _inky: I’ve read the gulag archipelago and know about Stalin ordering millions murdered most of which were probably completely innocent
[05:38:52] <_inky> well, i would say something like that.
[05:39:04] <_inky> Joanna, thank you.
[05:39:51] <_inky> JimBuntu: every time i meet a european or american leftist who supports north korea i ask them to move there.
[05:40:14] <_inky> or for some reason european leftists, well many of them, tend to adore putin.
[05:40:24] <JimBuntu> Well, i would kind of expand that to any person from anywhere of any political side, _inky , but yeah
[05:40:31] <_inky> they probably hate usa so much that they think putin is a greater good.
[05:40:32] <Joanna> Free speech is an illusion if you question the wrong things and get too popular, something will be done about it no matter what country you live in.
[05:40:49] <_inky> but they don't realize the russian elite rob the country and have golden lavatories.
[05:40:55] <JimBuntu> Joanna, the illusion is that the same thing doesn't happen elsewhere but with full and open approval
[05:41:01] <_inky> those aren't left people.
[05:41:22] <_inky> Joanna, what i am saying, it's not boolean. it's not 1 or 0.
[05:41:26] <_inky> it's a scale.
[05:41:33] <Joanna> For instance if you live in America and start convincing a lot of people not to pay taxes you will be definitely be stopped .
[05:41:35] <JimBuntu> There is always 'for national security', but that applies everywhere
[05:41:42] <_inky> and certainly you are allowed more in usa than in russia. and certainly more in russia than in north korea.
[05:42:16] <JimBuntu> I thin that in Russia, proper and actual Russia and not only ex-soviet places... it's more in the open that it's all about money. Very much like in Mexico
[05:42:17] <_inky> and we don't remember an american journalist who entered an american embassy and was killed there by americans.
[05:42:26] <_inky> but we remember such case with saudi arabia.
[05:43:20] <_inky> JimBuntu: but they tell people that 'americans are dirty' and 'the russian gov is christian and spiritual'.
[05:43:38] <JimBuntu> Sure, governments lie to their people, not exclusive to Russia or anywhere
[05:44:03] <JimBuntu> The internet (fast, cheap comms in general) make this more and more dofficult for 'free' countries.  
[05:44:04] <_inky> at least presidents change in usa.
[05:44:04] <Joanna> America has “free speech “ because they know most people are completely brainwashed.
[05:44:24] <_inky> noone ruled for more than 20 years.
[05:44:35] <JimBuntu> Putin has changed a lot in the last 20 years, lol... from this position to that one and then back to this one, lol
[05:44:38] <_inky> well i prefer that reality. i think that reality has to be valued.
[05:45:24] <JimBuntu> America has free speech because it was deemed important enough to lead the Amendments... and people were smart enough to make it very hard to remove
[05:46:04] <JimBuntu> being protected as the first A, doesn't mean too much though given the proper definition and the obvious times it's excluded... even if not talked about nearly enough
[05:46:29] <_inky> Joanna: do you know that in Russia there is one government institution which can force closing any internet site access to ISP's without a court. Just by decision of one man.
[05:46:42] <JimBuntu> or woman?>
[05:46:51] <_inky> do you know that every internet access point requires authentication of a person by mobile phone which is linked to passport data?
[05:47:13] <Joanna> I don’t care what country you are from or what kind of government you have . My definition of if you have freedom is defined by how often do you need to get government permission to do ordinary things in life. Do you need government permission to get to your food supply? Do you need government permission to use your own body to earn a living ? Do you need government permission to leave your house. By permission I mean do you need 
[05:47:13] <Joanna> anything issued by the government...
[05:47:38] <JimBuntu> Licenses?
[05:47:42] <Joanna> As inky said it is a scale of freedom
[05:47:53] <JimBuntu> Sure, most everything is on a scale.
[05:47:58] <_inky> well in those terms russia might seem a more free country sometimes, but it isn't.
[05:48:06] <_inky> i don't think it is a right way to measure freedom.
[05:48:15] <_inky> it is one of the ways to gain or loose scores, for sure.
[05:48:19] <JimBuntu> To use your own body to earn a living is kind of vague though... do you mean to earna  living that is not otherwise illegal?
[05:48:50] <_inky> just russian elite doesn't care about covid, and cares more about their own money.
[05:49:21] <Joanna> If you live in the us and everything has been designed so you must drive a car and to drive a car you need a driver’s license issued by government which can be revoked for any reason they choose .. I’m sorry but you are not free.
[05:49:57] <_inky> well, it is not boolean.
[05:49:59] <JimBuntu> Well, I think you technically only need a drivers license if you want to access specific kinds of roads, but I get what you mean
[05:50:00] <_inky> it is not true or false.
[05:50:09] <_inky> i understand and i sincerely value very much
[05:50:13] <_inky> your approach.
[05:50:25] <_inky> but we can measure different things
[05:50:31] <Joanna> JimBuntu: it doesn’t matter what your body is doing you still need government permission to work legally right ? You have to have an ssn issued by the government!
[05:50:32] <_inky> and add or subtract scores.
[05:50:39] <_inky> so what you want is a dream here.
[05:50:51] <_inky> do you think you shouldn't have a driver license in russia or north korea?
[05:51:01] <_inky> well in north korea you first of all wouldn't even have a car.
[05:51:35] <_inky> overall usa is one of the most free states in the world. if you compare it with other countries.
[05:51:40] <_inky> that's what i am trying to say.
[05:51:43] <JimBuntu> no Joanna , don't NEED an SSN, there are other ways to make sure the tax man gets their money... but you don't even need those simply to work. Paying taxes is ultimately up to the individual. A business can make contributions without that account and the individual can set up their forms so they don't pay except at the end of each fiscal year.
[05:51:47] <_inky> i understand that you aren't happy about many things.
[05:51:55] <_inky> but if we count everything, you'd see it's more free.
[05:52:33] <Joanna> JimBuntu: yes it’s possible to drive a car without permission from government but if we delve into illegal behavior that’s another subject entirely. I’m talking about things you can do without government permission without any fear of repercussions.
[05:52:51] <_inky> i would link some freedom of speech rating, but you'd say they are financed by usa and not trustworthy.
[05:52:51] <JimBuntu> Joanna, I used to work alongside Amish and Menonite... no SSNs, but they had a form of tax id (some of the time)
[05:53:23] <JimBuntu> Joanna: re driving, I was talking about legally... don't ALWAYS need a license to drive, but if you want to use certain types of roads you do
[05:53:59] <JimBuntu> A license is permission to do something otherwise illegal. You are totally right about that.
[05:54:02] <_inky> people killed a journalist (namely Politkovskaya) in the Putin's birthday. to make him a present, probably.
[05:54:10] *** Joins: vvande (~vvande@d66-183-139-240.bchsia.telus.net)
[05:54:13] <Joanna> Exactly and the roads to what people need most such as food are in that category
[05:54:21] <_inky> which journalist was killed in usa to make a present to the president in their birthday?
[05:54:29] <_inky> can you imagine which differences are we talking about?
[05:54:29] <JimBuntu> Well _inky , with the quality of journalists lately, i would probably do the same
[05:54:36] <_inky> and whatever you don't like is worse in other countries.
[05:54:48] <_inky> not that you don't need to fight for more rights. you need to. 
[05:54:56] <_inky> but it doesn't mean other countries are doing better.
[05:55:13] <_inky> JimBuntu: (((:
[05:55:23] <JimBuntu> Liberia is a fork of America, check them out some time
[05:56:07] <_inky> again, i think there is a scale of feelings.
[05:56:24] <Joanna> _inky: most journalists that most people listen to are mouthpieces of the government
[05:56:27] <JimBuntu> There is nothing about America that is new... the entire US system was based on a variety of other systems. It's all plagarised.
[05:56:33] <JimBuntu> +1 Joanna 
[05:57:06] <_inky> me and you can have different situations, but same feelings about those situations.
[05:57:23] <Joanna> I’d say the us is closest to England
[05:57:35] <JimBuntu> _inky, I'm late to the chat. Are you in proper Russia
[05:57:56] <_inky> some feel very bad because they need to wait a second for the video to load, some don't have internet at all, and feel bad because their child was eaten by a tiger.
[05:58:08] <JimBuntu> oof. Not sure about that Joanna , tons of US stuff was lifted from Netherlands, Belgium, Spain, Italy, Rome... on and on
[05:58:10] <_inky> but on the scale they can have the same feeling.
[05:58:17] <_inky> so they won't understand each other's problems.
[05:58:22] <JimBuntu> Although, to be fair, England is just a child of Rome
[05:58:26] <_inky> one would say 'it is the same here'.
[05:59:29] <Joanna> JimBuntu: don’t forget the horrible Prussian school system
[05:59:45] <JimBuntu> England has/had Church of England... no such thing in USA, never was
[06:00:00] <JimBuntu> Well, as far as schooling, it changed a lot over time.
[06:00:33] <Joanna> I know someone in Syria and they have more freedom there from government meddling
[06:01:09] <JimBuntu> While the colonies (some of them) in the US came from England, they also came from many other places... but at the end of the day, it was scholars educated in history who picked and packed ideas from most of history to form the US system
[06:01:31] <JimBuntu> But... in Syria, they can't even get geography right, lol
[06:01:38] <_inky> by the way. i need to say that i disagree with the arguments like 'i know someone from armenia they told me'. because i can always use such an argument and you don't have a proof of what i have said. maybe what i have said is complete nonsense.
[06:01:46] <_inky> https://rsf.org/en/ranking_table
[06:01:57] <_inky> they have some metrics to measure. not that the metrics are perfect.
[06:02:09] <_inky> but that's some way of measuring.
[06:02:19] <Joanna> Americans schooling was once voluntary and mixed ages of children learning together when they weren’t needed for farm work
[06:02:43] <JimBuntu> Joanna, as we have discussed, my children attend mixed age schooling, it's actually still a thing, although rare
[06:02:55] <_inky> USA - 44th place. Armenia - 63th. Russia - 150th.
[06:02:59] <_inky> feels fair.
[06:03:03] <Atque> JimBuntu: During the colonial period?
[06:03:35] <JimBuntu> Atque, Hi!  Also, can you be a bit more specific with your question please and I am happy to comment.
[06:03:38] <_inky> China - 177th.
[06:04:06] <_inky> so i am leaving. thank you for your interest. i'd prefer actually to talk less about my region.
[06:04:24] <_inky> i would like to talk more about programming to get distracted from regional problems.
[06:04:31] <_inky> but whatever. thank you for attention.
[06:04:39] <_inky> and i indeed value very much distrust in government.
[06:04:57] <_inky> but i try to show you that sometimes state and taxes are a luxury you need first to have, then to hate.
[06:05:26] <_inky> i have about 3 hours to sleep, so i leave. nothing personal.
[06:05:40] <JimBuntu> later _inky , sleep well and deep
[06:06:29] <Joanna> That website shows Australia having an abuse score of zero and last I heard Australia is literally putting people in internment camps so someone is lying ...
[06:06:58] <JimBuntu> interesting Joanna , I didn't visit the link, lol, maybe it's from Australia
[06:07:07] <_inky> well their metrics aren't ideal. but those are some metrics. other organizations have other measurements and metrics.
[06:07:14] *** Joins: Malvolio (~Malvolio@user/malvolio)
[06:07:17] <_inky> but you will hardly see china as the most free country.
[06:07:50] <_inky> the picture is more or less realistic i believe.
[06:07:58] <JimBuntu> There should really be 0 discussion if China is free... that's kind of like discussing if the Moon is made of cheddar cheese, isn't it?
[06:07:59] <Joanna> We don’t have anyone from China here unfortunately
[06:08:10] <Joanna> I’d love to ask them some questions
[06:08:19] <_inky> doesn't matter. we cannot trust a separate person. they can tell you whatever they want to believe in.
[06:08:24] <_inky> i tell you what i believe in.
[06:08:31] <JimBuntu> yeah Joanna , unfortunately, the issue is that they aren't free to come here and discuss openly
[06:08:44] <_inky> but suppose someone who was affiliated with former corrupted government would say you completely different things about my country.
[06:08:54] <Joanna> Maybe #programming or bigger channels have chinese
[06:08:58] <_inky> you cannot trust what a person says.
[06:09:05] <_inky> one person.
[06:09:31] <_inky> and you cannot use it as an argument. because then the other side has no arguments. or need to use such arguments that have no proof.
[06:09:33] <JimBuntu> You can somewhat trust what tons of people show in their videos though... I can give you some YouTubers as exampled, although,... obviously... youTubers/expats
[06:09:45] <Joanna> _inky: I know people are not always reliable and often biased and brainwashed but I still trust them. More than news media if they can answer my questions
[06:10:37] <Joanna> JimBuntu: what happened to that guy code that had brother in China
[06:10:42] <_inky> okay good time of day. hope you didn't feel very much not understood.
[06:10:49] <Joanna> I haven’t seen him since freenode
[06:10:53] <JimBuntu> The nunber one issue with chatting with people from China, still in China... is the whole China control of the internet issue
[06:10:56] <Joanna> Remember codeaholic?
[06:11:25] <JimBuntu> yeah, not sure.. haven't talked to them much since the libera move
[06:11:33] <_inky> dw has a documentary on chinese surveillance systems. worth watching.
[06:11:40] <_inky> and about social ranking.
[06:11:53] <_inky> leaving.
[06:12:00] * _inky zzz
[06:12:00] <JimBuntu> Most of my sources from within China have dried up lately... either moved or simply stopped being present on the interwebs
[06:12:24] <Joanna> China might be horrible as you say but a lot of countries are just as bad and pretend to be otherwise
[06:12:48] <JimBuntu> ^^ I see no issue with this statement
[06:13:36] <Joanna> In the us you can’t board a plane or train without government permission so I don’t know why people still think they have freedom when they don’t
[06:13:44] <JimBuntu> Joanna, quick question... did you know that as an outsider you can't simply stay at a hotel, you can only stay at sanctioned hotels and only with permission from a special entity?
[06:14:30] <JimBuntu> Joanna, well, you need to better define government in the case of flight and train. I can most certaintly board a train without any government ovesight, not so much (but toally possible) for planes... but they are expensive at that point
[06:15:02] <JimBuntu> My pilot will need government oversight though... flight patths and all that included.
[06:15:07] <Joanna> JimBuntu: I’m away that China requires us citizens to have visas to go there. It all makes sense if they are trying to prevent mischief but they seemed to tolerate a lot of mischief in Hong Kong
[06:15:17] <Joanna> Aware
[06:15:33] <JimBuntu> no no no Joanna , I mean to stay at any hotel, specifically... not just to enter
[06:15:46] <JimBuntu> any hotel, every hotel
[06:16:08] <JimBuntu> hotel, motel, inn, persons home
[06:16:12] <Joanna> JimBuntu: you have to have ID issued by government to travel. Correct ?
[06:16:16] <JimBuntu> no
[06:16:35] <Joanna> As well as not be on the no fly list
[06:16:36] <JimBuntu> Well, I guess, kind of... depending on what you mean by it
[06:17:18] <JimBuntu> You can have your normal documents, and travel, even as an ex-pat... but no document you get at the start means you can stay at any specific lodge... and nothing you get during the travel means you can either, other than for that specific night
[06:18:01] <Joanna> For China?
[06:18:10] <JimBuntu> Say your car breaks down mid-trip... you are near a village and need a room... they can't give you a room, period, without permission from a specific kind of gov worker
[06:18:13] <JimBuntu> yes, China

[06:18:33] <Joanna> Sounds like their government has good opsec :)
[06:18:50] <Joanna> Or horrible bureaucracy
[06:18:50] <JimBuntu> if by opsec you mean the ability to generate profit, yes
[06:19:19] <JimBuntu> This is just one tiny thing... I could share more
[06:19:37] <Joanna> The less involvement the government has in my life the better. That’s how I see it
[06:20:04] <Joanna> I’ve heard North Korea has minders for tourists
[06:20:28] <JimBuntu> They never shut down old informat systems either... you could have someone making money, getting paid every months... for 50 years... so spy on whaever group... and they can call you in and initiate a complete investigation... even if the threat is gone... like the country no longer exists
[06:20:59] <JimBuntu> Agreed, least involvment is best
[06:21:17] <Joanna> But it’s moving in opposite direction
[06:21:29] <Joanna> The internet of things
[06:21:31] <JimBuntu> Agreed again
[06:21:41] <JimBuntu> Internet of Everything, IOE, get used to the term
[06:22:12] <Joanna> JimBuntu: have you listened to the Corbett report Podcast? The link is in topic.
[06:22:17] <JimBuntu> IoT was the start, IoE is the end game
[06:22:33] <JimBuntu> nah, I ignore Corbett(spelling?). He is placed.
[06:22:42] <Joanna> Placed ?
[06:22:42] <JimBuntu> Corbert?
[06:23:01] <JimBuntu> Placed into position by the powers that be in HolyWierd
[06:23:19] <Joanna> Link is in topic
[06:23:45] <JimBuntu> I'm still not going to give them a visit, even if in topic. Total trash, meant to be trash

[21:28:37] <jan6> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4314163/create-iptables-rule-per-process-service
[21:28:41] <jan6> old, but probably works
[21:33:11] <jan6> all the nftables and whatever probably have similar stuff, too
[21:34:24] <jan6> probably check the manpage about what options the version you have, supports
[21:34:41] <jan6> there's similar support in other firewall software also, usually
[21:36:10] <jan6> e.g. with firewalld you'd probably make a zone with only one of the vpn interfaces, and assign your program to that zone
