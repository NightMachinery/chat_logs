[02:43:25] <rawtaz> ash_worksi: < slaughter> [10:37:42 AM]  <ash_worksi> anyway; the point is, I'd like to try to forbid "you tried to deploy without a secret for that user you just made on the database" >  not sure I follow on this. Talking something like a service "user" account and accompanying password?
[02:44:01] <slaughter> Wow rawtaz I always wanted a PA
[02:44:05] <slaughter> <3
[02:44:09] <rawtaz> <3
[02:44:11] <rawtaz> :*
[02:45:07] <rawtaz> im so deprived of social appreciation that i do anything to get noticed. so here i am copy pasting text to someone who didnt care enough to even stay..
[02:46:14] <ash_worksi> wow, that's really nice of rawtaz , thanks
[02:46:43] <ash_worksi> but yea, I welcome all opinions
[02:47:36] <ash_worksi> I was thinking about it, and I figure, I mean people probably prescribe certain criteria for an application. I just wonder if there's a way for CI to interpret that perscription
[02:47:57] <ash_worksi> prescription* ?
[02:48:29] * rawtaz &
[02:49:30] <ash_worksi> ?
[02:57:11] <slaughter> Prescription, yes
[02:57:31] <slaughter> I'm just still not sure what you're reallly getting at, personally. What exactly is the problem you're trying to solve ash_worksi 
[02:58:41] *** Quits: uvolmer (~uvolmer@2001-4dd0-212c-82-e069-f5f7-ab7b-8443.ipv6dyn.netcologne.de) (Ping timeout: 245 seconds)
[03:04:10] <ash_worksi> slaughter: I am trying to work around my own (and possibly others) stupidity in hopefully a professional manner
[03:04:28] <ash_worksi> my quote is a good use case of something stupid I could do
[03:09:06] <slaughter> Ok so you're looking for a solution that will check necessary secret values (such as DB connection information) before deployment?
[03:09:31] <slaughter> And/or other things, but that being the original thought
[03:09:48] <slaughter> ash_worksi sorry a bit async on IRC right now heh
[03:16:34] <ash_worksi> slaughter: pretty much ... the more I think about this, the more I feel like it's simply impossible
[03:17:08] <slaughter> Mmmm nothing is impossible, this least of all
[03:17:19] <slaughter> First solution: testing
[03:18:17] <slaughter> Your tests could include some "existence of secret value" checks
[03:19:00] *** Joins: ash_m (~androirc@user/ash-m/x-3292451)
[03:19:15] <ash_m> Annnnd my power is out
[03:19:28] <ash_m> What's the last thing I said?
[03:19:30] <slaughter> As a non-solution but also solution: automatic rollbacks if things fail. IE your app fails to start because it can't connect to the DB? Automatic rollback
[03:19:46] <slaughter> ash_m [04:46:34 PM]  <ash_worksi> slaughter: pretty much ... the more I think about this, the more I feel like it's simply impossible
[03:19:56] <ash_m> Awesome
[03:20:24] <ash_m> Ok. Yeah for applications that's easy. For a db not so much
[03:20:56] <slaughter> Another solution, and one I've participated in previously and found to be "good enough" without diving into weird solutions: your PR template has a section "ARE THERE ANY NEW SECRETS? HAVE YOU ADDED THEM?"
[03:21:00] *** Quits: ash_worksi (~ash_m@user/ash-m/x-3292451) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[03:21:26] <ash_m> Hmmm
[03:21:33] <slaughter> And if that's not doing it for you, have the PR review process be codified to include double checking the presence of said secret
[03:23:07] <slaughter> All that said, what do you do if the secret is there and the value is wrong?
[03:24:37] <ash_m> So... I have a few things to noob at you. Firstly are you referring to PRs (personally) in the context of github or is that something you can do (I have never done) with just git?
[03:24:49] <slaughter> I don't actually have any answer to that, it's a legitimate question but also one that I don't think usually needs a solution for. IE You fix the value. Missing the secret? Fix it. Keeps happening? Create a process to prevent it happening again, and a plan for what to do if it does
[03:25:20] <ash_m> The "create a process" is of interest to me
[03:25:59] <slaughter> PRs in github/bitbucket/gitlab/etc. The concept of a PR in git does exist though I can't speak to how it exactly works other than knowing "git pull-request" exists
[03:26:14] <ash_m> I see
[03:26:26] <ash_m> Hmm
[03:27:08] <slaughter> It sounds like you should probably create a process and plan before you start trying to figure out some overly complex solution
[03:27:26] <ash_m> I'm thinking of an overall service document.. Perhaps yaml, that CI could reference
[03:27:54] <ash_m> So a pipeline would check for the service in the file and abort if not found
[03:28:12] <slaughter> Sounds like tests with extra steps to me
[03:28:16] <ash_m> The idea would be more to document relationships
[03:28:53] <ash_m> So like if you want to know what other services some service depends on, you could look it up
[03:29:20] <slaughter> That might work for small applications, but for larger applications/distributed microservices/etc that's quite a bit of extra work that's going to end up having the same "we forgot to..." IMO
[03:29:31] <ash_m> Hmm
[03:30:02] <slaughter> If you want to know what services depend on each other, that should hopefully be well outlined in IaC and documentation
[03:30:10] <ash_m> I wonder if depends_on is a key in a Docker stack file
[03:30:25] <slaughter> Compose does have that yes
[03:30:40] <ash_m> Iac = infrastructure as code?
[03:30:43] <slaughter> Yes
[03:30:55] <ash_m> Yes but not all composed keys are valid for swarm
[03:31:03] <ash_m> Compose*
[03:31:14] <ash_m> Using voice to text now
[03:31:25] <ash_m> I can't swipe fast enough for my thoughts
[03:31:32] <slaughter> Also if you're working entirely in Docker your dependencies are laid out right there
[03:32:00] <slaughter> It really seems to me that you need standards and processes for some things, not new tooling
[03:32:11] <ash_m> In the situation those files are used purely to set up development environments where stack files only deploy single Production Services
[03:32:16] <ash_m> This*
[03:32:53] <slaughter> Is your development environment different (enough) from your prod?
[03:34:20] <ash_m> Usually, don't services are anything from a simple `image:` to some mild config. Prod services have config for standby servers, prod users, etc
[03:34:53] <ash_m> Like, rabbitmq would not have a password in dev
[03:36:07] <ash_m> Idk, I totally agree about just coming up with a process
[03:38:22] <ash_m> slaughter btw what do you think of using the same secret for an app and db. Sane? Typical? Flawed?
[03:39:26] <ash_m> Like, secrets are available to any service on the swarm right?
[03:46:48] <slaughter> When you say same secret for an app and a DB do you mean using the same value somewhere or that each container uses the same secret keys from the secret management service
[03:46:56] <slaughter> I have no idea how docker secrets work
[03:47:02] <slaughter> So can't comment RE: swarm
[03:47:29] <slaughter> ash_m 
[03:48:13] <ash_m> It's a fairly basic management system
[03:48:56] <ash_m> But I don't think you want to hear me prattle on about that
[03:50:15] <slaughter> But yeah if your question is "using the same value" IE same password for disparate systems, hell no that's not OK. If it's using the same base key:value from the secrets manager yeah I don't see an issue with that, particularly if you're already using the same secrets manager and therefore everything has the keys to that already
[03:51:26] *** Quits: pmercado (~pmercado@186.107.37.71) (Quit: Konversation terminated!)
[03:52:55] <ash_m> Right.... I think. The point is I'll have basically env: pg_pass: pgpass_secret in both the db deployment and the app deployment
[03:53:20] <ash_m> Although, I think secrets are just "available"
[03:54:59] <ash_m> Anyway, thanks for your time. I don't want to bother you too much

[20:42:51] *** Quits: shad (~shad@user/shad) (Quit: WeeChat 3.0)
[20:47:57] <slaughter> Well half the questions are super git specific so better asked in #git
[20:49:27] <slaughter> And of the remaining half, the majority are just inanely stupid and angry questions about something easily answered by a quick search/outlined in the docs for the feature in question/not answerable by anyone on IRC because they're actually looking for Github Support
[20:49:47] <slaughter> So there's just this tiny sliver of relevant and answerable questions
[20:50:37] <rawtaz> lol
[20:52:52] <slaughter> And god help us all if someone is asking a question about Pages
[20:52:59] <slaughter> Those are my favorite
[20:53:39] <slaughter> Like 99% of those questions come from users that it turns out only know what git even is because they want a free hosting platform for their dogshit blog
[20:53:57] <slaughter> "Connected from mibbit"
[20:55:13] <rawtaz> how descriptive
[20:55:15] <rawtaz> dogshit blog
[20:55:33] <rawtaz> yeah, and its funny how many people thing that "git" means "github" :P
[20:56:12] <rawtaz> and god im so tired of all the repos i have to deal with that are just a pile of shit commits, like "fix blah" and that hasnt got good commit hygiene
[21:04:57] <slaughter> Enforce conventional/semantic commits and PR titles
[21:05:31] <slaughter> People will complain for a few days, sure. But it's worth it
[21:06:05] <rawtaz> its impossible when people dont have the brains to add and commit files properly, im afraid
[21:06:31] <rawtaz> you cannot script/control that they only include the relevant line changes in commit A, the other relevant ones in commit B, etc.
[21:06:39] <rawtaz> nor can you control that they write proper messages
[21:07:57] <rawtaz> https://kopy.io/ywvln#uMqxbNfMrDzb50 for example. that should be a few commits, and properly named
[21:08:36] <rawtaz> the key to success is to not work with people who need to be educated on how to do that stuff properly. those that need education in that regard are not good enough to be useful in the first place
[21:08:53] <rawtaz> because this is absolute fundamentals, pure common sense. it's not a matter of not knowing how to use git.
[21:11:43] <slaughter> Enforce semantic PR titles, limit to squash merges. Commit messages and files and all that be damned, at least your history will be readable
[21:12:06] <slaughter> Though you're not wrong, and that commit list proves it/gives me anger problems
[21:13:02] <rawtaz> what would a "semantic pr title" consist of? :o
[21:16:18] <slaughter> Ok so you have conventional commits - https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/
[21:16:25] <slaughter> Which are also sometimes called semantic commits
[21:16:33] <slaughter> For a PR title it's basically just following that
[21:17:05] <slaughter> IE: `feat: JIRA-123 - add state selection dropdown component`
[21:17:51] <slaughter> And then if you use Github Actions, there's already an action to enforce that - https://github.com/amannn/action-semantic-pull-request
[21:19:09] <rawtaz> oh thanks, had no idea about that
[21:19:21] <slaughter> And that looks like so in practice: https://pastebin.com/06vg9xPt
[21:20:26] <rawtaz> haha
[21:20:35] <rawtaz> now, i COULD enforce that. but they dont use PRs! :D
[21:21:14] <slaughter> Excuse me what in the fuck
[21:21:15] <rawtaz> since theyre such n00bs, PRs is too much complexity. but truth be told, i dont want them to use PRs, because then i have to review the code, and OMG their code is horrible. i'd rather not have the responsibility of having said "fine, merge this"
[21:21:28] <rawtaz> i always use PRs, since im contributing to their project
[21:22:09] <slaughter> And you say consulting is good?
[21:23:34] <rawtaz> heh nah
[21:23:40] <rawtaz> its usually horrible :P
[21:24:03] <slaughter> Sounds toxic. Literally every story you have makes me want to die a bit
[21:24:08] <rawtaz> yeah
[21:24:12] <slaughter> You're a strong person
[21:24:32] <rawtaz> you know, its just the real world, and im sure it's in many aspects better in larger projects where people are more serious
[21:25:50] <slaughter> Not always but yeah in general the larger the project/org the more sane processes become
[21:25:57] <rawtaz> yeah
[21:26:06] <slaughter> Process overhead is far outweighed by sanity
[21:26:28] <slaughter> Though at this point 90% of process overhead is automated out of the way so there's not a lot to slow you down really
[21:26:35] <rawtaz> this person in this little project is just hte same tinkerer i talked about the other day. he's actually a serious problem solver, im often amazed at how he manages to get this webapp he built working and looking awesome. but he's not good with code quality lol
[21:26:45] <rawtaz> yeah
[21:50:59] <slaughter> IME those people are the most dangerous when it comes to long term things
[21:51:18] <slaughter> Sure they can get it working and that's great but then you have to deal with whatever bananas thing they did later
[21:52:02] <slaughter> "yeah I just set /etc/hosts to this and then added this random dependency and set the route table to do whatever and it works"

[23:23:53] <slaughter> Multitasking is just doing many things badly almost universally
[23:24:09] <rawtaz> in the end, all that matters is who has the most tabs open anyway :D
[23:24:12] <rawtaz> yeah
[23:24:49] <slaughter> Bleh I hate having a bunch of tabs open
[23:25:00] <slaughter> But not as much as I love closing like 100 tabs at once
[23:25:38] <slaughter> "If I needed it I would have used it and not just left it as a random tab...I hope" *right click -> close multiple -> close tabs to the right* "Too late now!"
[23:26:15] <slaughter> If it gets to the point where I can't tell at a glance what each tab is (because the titles are too short) I take that as a sign I need to clean up
[23:27:26] <rawtaz> thats your thinking because you dont procrastitask well enough. one opens about 20 tabs with useful and relevant info for thing X, then moves on to thing Y, keeping the tabs around for getting back to later
[23:27:32] <rawtaz> thats how it piles up
[23:44:11] <slaughter> I've started trying to use tab groups for that
[23:44:28] <slaughter> But haven't nailed the workflow quite yet
[23:44:46] <slaughter> End up just using whichever tab group I'm in as my "general" one until I realize then I have to move things around
[23:46:24] <rawtaz> yeah i find its easier to just use separate windows instead. but i guess it doesnt matter much
[23:49:42] <rawtaz> one thing that i love with safari and that other browsers doesnt have, is that each tab in incognito mode is "isolated". so if i log in in one tab, and open another tab for the same site, im not logged in and no cookies are saved for it. thats a huge problem with the other browsers i think. in order to isolate incognito stuff i need to use separate profiles, which sucks.
[23:53:28] <ash_worksi> I am the definition of ADD; I will pretty much get distracted by anything
[23:54:48] <ash_worksi> right now, my distraction is, "can I easily figure out how I am grouping things today when I look back on it in the future and run `docker network inspect ... | jq '.[0].Containers[].Name'`
[23:54:56] <ash_worksi> s/$/"/
[23:55:51] <rawtaz> hm why do you need to ponder that? use docker compose and youll be fine
[23:56:11] <rawtaz> put another way, why do you need to look at the docker networks
[23:57:40] <slaughter> rawtaz use Firefox + Simple Tab Groups + the STG plugin for temporary containers
[23:58:30] <slaughter> It gets you the tab grouping you mentioned AND it gets you isolated containers. And it has 123984 options to let you screw yourself into being unable to open things 
[23:58:52] <rawtaz> problem is i use many different browsers, for various reasons, so i have effectively stopped using any extensions at all because theyre browser-specific usually :)
[23:59:11] <slaughter> Curious what your reasons are
[23:59:22] <rawtaz> ah, thats 123984 to socialize with you then
[23:59:58] <slaughter> I've always got several installed, usually for testing sites and the occasions that you HAVE TO USE CHROME BECAUSE THE DEVS HATE YOU, but those don't really crossover with my usual day-to-day browser usage
