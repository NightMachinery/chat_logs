[01:58:24] <Alfr> thomasb06, you want to return such a value or print it?
[01:59:37] <Alfr> thomasb06, NIL is the false values and everything else is considered true, T is usually used then you don't have anything more useful to return.
[01:59:59] <thomasb06> It seems the test expects true or false, but there are no hints these are types in Lisp. Maybe writing and returning are not the same...
[02:00:22] <thomasb06> Alfr ah, so maybe I just need to remove the writes
[02:00:24] <Alfr> thomasb06, well for scheme it's #f and #t.
[02:00:25] <thomasb06> let me try
[02:01:16] <thomasb06> Alfr if I let the last parens in the progn be the test, it should do
[02:01:58] <thomasb06> Alfr maaaany thanks... Many many
[02:02:15] <thomasb06> removing the writes goes well
[02:03:00] <thomasb06> Well, this is it for today. Tired already

[02:05:11] <Alfr> thomasb06, some notes: You don't need the progn, defun has an implicit one. You're setq-ing m and o without binding them, that'll refer to global and I don't think you want that.

[02:19:17] <jgart> amazigh, I agree ü§≠Ô∏è
[02:19:31] <jgart> it depends what I'm doing actually
[02:19:32] <amazigh> I am building an R7RS scheme on top Racket's Chez fork ^^
[02:19:58] <amazigh> I mean sort of R7RS, because R7RS is not finished
[02:20:21] <amazigh> How many years did it take for the hyperspec to be delivered?
[02:22:28] <sham1> There's also no funding in R7RS
[02:22:50] <amazigh> #true
[02:22:52] <sham1> Well, at least I don't think. Not the same amount the hyperspec had
[02:22:53] <moon-child> 10 years from cltl1 to ansi cl.  But I'm sure they were nto working on it continuously
[02:22:57] <sham1> At any rate
[02:23:08] <jgart> What is the big idea with R7RS?
[02:23:24] <jgart> it's raison d'etre, so to speak
[02:23:53] <jgart> To me it's just a newer RNRS
[02:23:57] <jgart> I'm not in the know
[02:24:00] <sham1> R6 was slightly controversial and so it was decided that a new standard would be developed from a more minimal and such substratum
[02:24:01] <jgart> or where can I read about it
[02:24:30] <jgart> s/it/it's history and motive for existing
[02:24:32] <energizer> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_(programming_language)#R7RS
[02:24:34] <jgart> sham1, got it
[02:24:44] <sham1> Of course with the current process it seems that R7RS won't be quite so minimalistic
[02:25:14] <jgart> so R7RS was a return to a more minimalistic spec/approach?
[02:25:41] <sham1> Yeah. R7-small is only a bit larger than R5RS IIRC
[02:26:16] <jgart> So, R6RS was hoping to be what python is more or less? batteries included for general programming?
[02:26:37] <jgart> maybe like racket, I guess
[02:26:47] <sham1> I guess. Wasn't around at the time so I'm just relaying what I remember reading about. So salt required

[02:32:10] <amazigh> they were indeed controversial additions and wording but that was not the biggest problem, the problem I think, is rivalery between implementers
[02:32:18] <sham1> R6 was also a departure from R5 in some ways I recall reading
[02:32:20] <amazigh> R6RS is not that different from R7RS-large
[02:33:02] <amazigh> I am not familiar with R5RS wording, but the main addition is libraries and syntax-case which ought to be part of R7RS-large
[02:33:21] <sham1> R7RS-Large might be larger than R6 however, which would be interesting
[02:33:43] <sham1> amazigh: error handling. They had conditions
[02:33:48] <sham1> R5 didn't 
[02:34:06] <jgart> How does the Steering commitee decide who will be part of the commitee?
[02:34:43] <jgart> Hopefully I'm not opening up a can of worms, ha
[02:35:00] <aap> should probably ask jcowan. i think he's the only one currently working on r7rs
[02:35:10] <amazigh> the editor is elected by the steering commitee on a program / planning / organization, and that was decided that R7RS-small and R7RS-large would be an open process
[02:35:27] <amazigh> by the editors
[02:35:29] <moon-child> aap: I think there are a few people working on it
[02:35:31] <moon-child> but he is the editor
[02:35:35] <amazigh> that also made some noise R6RS side
[02:35:55] <aap> ah i see
