[05:30:17] <Guddu> I wish to dynamically filter objects using date if is is greater than the value of a DateTime object. Is there a way of creating such a filter without having to manually specify each and every field?
[05:30:54] <schinckel> ente_: The main reason is so that you don't have to have out-of-channel knowledge of how to fetch a related object.
[05:31:35] <schinckel> If your object contains references to other related objects, and indicates the URL that should be used to fetch that object, then you can change that url and the link should still work (assuming clients don't cache data for too long)
[05:32:12] <schinckel> Also works for pagination too: a next-page/prev-page link could be changed from using limit/offset pagination to keyset pagination seamlessly from the perspective of the API consumer.
[05:33:00] <schinckel> It also means that an API consumer should theoretically be able to fetch any type of related object, because it has the URL of that object, rather than just and ID (and thus has to know how to use that ID to fetch)

[14:53:44] <kezabelle> wait so importing from future defers the name lookup intrinsically? handy.
[15:03:28] <jmft2> graingert, so looking forward to 3.10
[15:03:42] <graingert> jmft2: you can use it all today in 3.7+
[15:04:01] <graingert> kezabelle: it wraps them all in quotes at runtime
[15:05:58] <kezabelle> oh neat, maybe typing will actually end up in a sensible place. Nearly a py3k level duration to get there :p
[15:14:07] <jmft2> graingert, so does Django actually do any type checking? My naive understanding was that type hints get ignored at runtime
[15:15:07] <kezabelle> no, Django doesn't use annotations, and your unstanding is correct
[15:15:16] <kezabelle> ... understanding, too.
[15:15:38] <kezabelle> I think FastAPI is probably the biggest runtime user of annotations, in terms of web frameworks.
[15:16:47] <graingert> jmft2: https://github.com/typeddjango/django-stubs
[15:16:56] <kezabelle> Django internals don't even have annotations, and I get why [some of it is super hairy because ducktype] but it's a pain sometimes :p
[15:17:25] <graingert> kezabelle: you just use `pyupgrade --py37-plus` and `isort --add-imports=from __future__ import annotations`
[15:18:24] <graingert> kezabelle: there's no py3k level duration here. you can use it today! https://adamj.eu/tech/2021/05/15/python-type-hints-future-annotations/ /cc adamchainz
[15:21:15] <kezabelle> graingert: given annotations arrived at 3.0, there's a literal py3 duration involved. That's not withstanding the fact that when type hinting actually came along (3.5?) it was all nominal rather than structural
[15:22:04] <kezabelle> I think we finally got non-experimental structural in 3.8 maybe? 3.9? and I don't think I've ever seen it in the wild :/
[15:22:40] <graingert> kezabelle: you use typing_extensions.Protocol

[17:57:30] *** sandcat is now known as jess
[17:58:07] <Omikron> is there a way to retrieve the ids of the related objects of a ManyToManyField, just like ForeignKey provides a *_id attribute on the object, without making db accesses?
[18:04:25] <kezabelle> not without at least touching (querying) the intermediate table
[18:04:56] <kezabelle> why?
[18:08:49] <Omikron> I have quite a number of objects that I have to query (100k+) and each of them has this m2m field. So to speed up the query I'm loading all the data once and structuring it in memory.
[18:12:23] <kezabelle> ah that old chestnut :o)
[18:12:44] <kezabelle> what data do you need from the other side of the m2m? just the IDs?
[18:13:17] <kezabelle> cached_ids = frozenset(MyModel.<mym2mfieldname>.through.objects.values_list('myotherside_id', flat=True))
[18:14:00] <kezabelle> (that is: ask the intermediate table [which you may not have defined manually] for the list of the other side]
[18:21:49] <Omikron> Mostly the complete object. Since there are only a few (<500) objects on the side, I should be able to just load all of them without loosing to much speed

[18:29:21] <kezabelle> OtherSide.objects.filter(pk__in=InterMediateTable.objects.values('otherside_id')) would probably do it (subquery styles). Another option is to select_related (join) from the intermediate table to the otherside and pluck the othersides out.
[18:30:36] <kezabelle> so 1 or 2 queries in the cases I can think of :)
