[17:47:58] <Joanna> CalimeroTeknik: you participated in the medical experiment?
[17:48:43] <CalimeroTeknik> no, but I asked everyone what the effects were, and gave advice to those who were to get shots after that
[17:49:15] <CalimeroTeknik> simple things to deal with the potential side effects
[17:49:41] <CalimeroTeknik> sometimes outright recommending against, for certain cases where I deemed an allergic reaction likely to be strong
[17:50:40] <CalimeroTeknik> for some people they get one shot, two… and say "no third" because the second caused a way severe reaction
[17:52:00] <CalimeroTeknik> actually it turns out a bunch of people do get the covid in the two weeks after the shot, because that's when the intended vaccination effect (dedicated antibodies) has not at all started

[18:04:25] <Joanna> CalimeroTeknik: vaccines used to be to prevent sickness:)
[18:07:21] <Joanna> According to the latest news which may or not be true , much of the industry in Europe is about to be shut down as a result of Russia kicking nato out of Ukraine. Why is this starting to remind me of a crazy tv series??
[18:09:04] *** Joins: s1gyn (~s1gyn@user/s1gyn)
[18:09:53] <Joanna> So millions of people are about to be harshly punished for something that happened far away that they have nothing to do with.. when has this ever happened before? Oh yea the controlled demolition thing..
[18:11:55] *** Quits: hololeap (~hololeap@user/hololeap) (Quit: Bye)
[18:35:25] <CalimeroTeknik> Joanna, and it's still the purpose of mRNA 'vaccinal' shots, and it even works to an extent (prevent sickness)
[18:36:05] <CalimeroTeknik> though for some people the disease is no worse than the shot
[18:36:27] <CalimeroTeknik> (and in children the disease is typically milder)
[18:37:14] <CalimeroTeknik> well, not quite this actually, it's rather that the benefit/risk is towards not injecting
[19:17:49] <Joanna> CalimeroTeknik: sounds like a game of Russian roulette
[19:36:09] *** Quits: BiggieSmalls (~BiggieSma@user/biggiesmalls) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[19:41:34] <CalimeroTeknik> actually that's an incorrect parallel, because everyone is affected and that's part of the goal of the substance, but to varying degrees
[19:42:31] <CalimeroTeknik> and it's not random at all: a physician who knows you well can tell people individually
[19:43:09] <Decker> so entirely random given a lack of a physicisian who knows anyhing about anyone
[19:43:26] <CalimeroTeknik> in my case my doctor said "not like you risk much either way" and for my mother that she'd rather avoid the shots (specific reason due to a thing she has)
[19:44:02] <CalimeroTeknik> doctors aren't so incompetent as to be no better than coin toss
[19:48:05] <CalimeroTeknik> this is very far from completely stochastic unless you have not a single clue, I mean, but it can be true that a large part of the population has really no clue
[19:52:07] <jessicara> think the problem is more being in a constant state of triage for 5+ years
[19:52:14] <jessicara> than the doctors being incompetent
[19:52:29] <jessicara> daily decisions on who should get treatment or not
[19:52:59] <jessicara> something like vaccine risks seems tiny compared to the norm
