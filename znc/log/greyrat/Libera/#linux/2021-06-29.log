[00:55:36] <PaulFertser> DPA: for bridging you need 4 MAC addresses in every frame header. For whatever reason standard wifi has just 3. This is a non-standard extension (supported by mac80211, so all Linux softmac drivers) to pass the fourth as well and to be able to automatically create AP/VLAN interfaces on the AP side when that's used.
[00:56:45] <RedNifre> koollman: hang on, why do you need a slash at the end of --exclude? The way I interpret the man page, that would exclude the content of that directory, but not the directory itself?

[01:46:15] <kurahaupo_> RedNifre: git commit --date=…
[01:46:51] <RedNifre> yeah, I know, but that was a bit complicated. Running it on an offline raspberry pi with the system clock changed seemed like the more reliable approach.

[01:47:55] <RedNifre> I was worried that things like git init might pull the date at some point and put it somewhere, so using an offline pi with the clock changed felt like the most save "container" like approach.

[02:04:26] <Gustavo6046> i stopped systemd-resolved in hopes that it'd help
[02:04:29] <Gustavo6046> i have literally nothing actively using the network other than irc, tinc, and wireguard/bird, and a few servers running very idly
[02:04:33] <Gustavo6046> and i already use ufw now
[02:04:34] <Gustavo6046> and i now only have pihole running between here and quad9, no resolved caching

[02:07:15] <xythrez> Add a .PHONY: all and the above should work

[02:10:39] <TJ-> Gustavo6046: even with a strong signal it can be caused by interference. The 2.4GHz band is 'unlicenced' and any device, not just WiFi, can use it, and other devices often don't use WiFi modulation so can knock out the entire band

[02:11:33] <rascul> did you use a ruler?
[02:11:52] <Gustavo6046> my bedroom is right aside the living room, although sure, separated by a wall, and the door actually goes to a corridor that runs a little bit along the living room and then has a door to it

[02:51:51] <Dagmar> Gustavo6046: Multiple layers of NAT has existed long before IP over cell phones

[03:06:50] <kfrench> It's my understanding that one shouldn't consider "version numbers" as numerical data.  They should be compared as strings.
[03:07:22] <jiffe> a string compare alone with fail
[03:07:41] <kfrench> That's a comparison though.  It's not used for "sorting" order.  "version numbers" are more free form, so the correct sorting order is dependent on that specific package.
[03:08:09] <matsaman> you'd have to assume a versioning scheme at least
[03:08:13] <jiffe> in my case I can always assume major.minor.rev numerical values
[03:08:17] <matsaman> at which point it'd be pretty straightforward
[03:08:30] <matsaman> so is major greater than major? Minor than minor? Rev than rev?
[03:08:31] <matsaman> done
[03:08:43] <jiffe> I was looking for a single command to do this
[03:08:52] <Dagmar> If you want to do that, the "rough-outline" way to go about it is to break the version number up into an array, and then pad each element with up to three digits, then stick them all together (padding to however many numbers is the maximum you have, like 1.12.101.3.12)
[03:08:59] <matsaman> why use a single command when you can use three single commands
[03:09:01] <kfrench> If yours are #.#.#, then you need to split each piece up and compare them directly.  Otherwise 1.2 will be greater than 1.10.
[03:09:15] <Dagmar> THere's no "single command" that's going to be able to really do that without it becoming a bloody nightmare

Now I would like to get back the default behaviour of ^I (C0 character code 0x09). This does not work. Now Ctrl-I outputs '9' keycode 9 not 09. Anyone knows why?

[14:58:51] <PaulFertser> BCMM: I suggest to avoid using GMT when talking about timescales altogether. And use UTC instead, as that the standard way agreed upon by all the astronomers (including those from the UK).

[14:59:22] <p0g0> Now there's a notion, local time being assessed by your Earth Centered Earth Focussed geolocation... no more timezones, just a precise time of day at your exact locale.
[14:59:26] <swarfega> right because everyone understands UTC
[14:59:32] <BCMM> ok, but you seem to be backing up that suggestion but deliberately not knowing what a time zone is

[15:02:11] <swarfega> BCMM: it would be very small difference but yes it would be different
[15:02:11] <p0g0> BCMM, GMT has a history, running back to the early construction of time keeping devices.  It has lost that meaning in the modern context.
[15:02:12] <lopid> freeman_h, if it's a user cron job, yes
[15:02:31] <BCMM> p0g0: ok?
[15:02:52] <akik> no it hasn't lost its meaning
[15:02:58] <akik> are you on drugs?
[15:03:23] <PaulFertser> akik: please check https://www.ucolick.org/~sla/leapsecs/timescales.html#GMT , this has both the history and the clarifications from the astronomers
[15:03:26] <CommunistWolf> just use %s everywhere
[15:03:35] <BCMM> p0g0: what i'm saying is that the use of Greenwich time for clocks outside of london was pioneered by railway stations, which at one point would have had clocks showing a different time from the rest of the town
[15:03:50] <p0g0> BCMM, when I first moved here, my neighbors all had a local time, whatever their clocks said was the time, usually about 1.5 hours wrong from EST.
[15:04:03] <CommunistWolf> people can make any local adjustments they like after the fact, but comparisons suddenly become globally meaningful
[15:04:33] <BCMM> p0g0: as in, they actually used local mean time for practical day-to-day use?
[15:04:50] <p0g0> BCMM, iirc, the Ukraine (I may well have that wrong) runs all the federal clocks off the phase of their electrical grid, which has been losing congruity with "real time" for years...
[15:05:06] <geirha> freeman_h: what's the point of using -u when you redirect all output to /dev/null anyway?
[15:05:08] <p0g0> So all the trains clocks are not set to any standard outside the nation.

[15:17:07] <p0g0> BCMM, I got that story from a local, (abc), and in that discussion I was told that the nation did not in fact try to spin up the phase rate to repair the time differences.  Word of mouth stuff, and I have never seen it myself.

[19:33:36] <ananke> 'rpm hell', is a dependency issue stemming from using multiple discrete repositories which are not in sync when it comes to dependency info. it's not specific to RPM at all, and affects other package managers

[22:30:46] <c705> rsync, yeah
[22:31:03] <kubast2> an absolutist way to do 1) is to use a log structured file system, but that uses shit ton of space overtime

[22:32:42] <peetaur> rsync is a poor quality backup unless you can verify consistency of files... if eg /var/mysql/somefile1 depends on /var/mysql/somefile2 having a specific content (fsynced together) and you copy them at different times, will it work or be corrupt?  and also you still need to handle snapshots som eway so you have multiple restore points.

[22:38:17] <peetaur> ajalaka: generally dedup is nothing like hardlinks

[23:09:23] <curdlesnoot> Guest72: the /etc/localtime file has no bearing on how the hwclock stores time on most systems, without direct user intervention. for example, you might run "timedatectl set-local-rtc 1" on a systemd-using system for the hwclock not to store UTC. usually, there's no reason to.

[23:25:51] <Guest72> curdlesnoot that was the first question I had; I initially thought I'd set the date time manually by passing the modified time directly but then again I wonder how I would persist that datetime value after reboots and if it would mess with what's set inside /etc/localtime
[23:25:56] <DLange> 'cause you'll only find data errors on read (which is what badblocks does)
[23:26:08] <curdlesnoot> Guest72: or, to put it another way, /etc/localtime only informs how it's displayed with -d. it doesn't inform how the input is interpreted.
