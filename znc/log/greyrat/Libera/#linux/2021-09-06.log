[00:05:01] <asgas> Well here's the issue with PDF. The core is an open format, but there are some proprietary extensions to PDF such as XFA that are still used today. Do you mind at all that there is no guarantee a PDF will work with the reader?

[00:08:13] <asgas> No, I'm talking about a PDF file, that has features that are proprietary. The PDF without XFA and the PDF with are both PDF documents, but the one with XFA forms will not work outside of select readers. Governments love to use XFA for some reason. So if you submit tax info, you probably have to use acrobat reader.

[04:10:33] <MinusOne> well vqueiroz, it is a strong source of 2.4GHz signals, which is also what bluetooth uses. So interference could be causing issues. Not the router doing anything wrong, just a fact of life

[04:28:28] <Sauvin> I'd fear rootkits more.
[04:28:39] <MinusOne> mostly true Fawkess, just don't download and install weird crap, have a firewall, update your system, you're probably safe from viruses
[04:28:41] <phogg> Fawkess: but it's true that in many cases Linux users don't run antivirus, because it's much less *necessary*--partially because we are much less targeted for attack
[04:28:45] <Fawkess> yea but still firewalld is not enough?

[04:31:53] <phogg> Fawkess: It would probably not work. Depends on the virus.
[04:32:00] <phogg> First, you would need wine to even load it.
[04:32:14] <sheep> you could run them in wine, but wine doesn't implement the windows APIs the same way windows itself does
[04:32:14] <Fawkess> can run virus through wine ?
[04:32:26] <ayecee> who's going to stop you
[04:32:33] <Sauvin> Some might. I suspect most won't.
[04:32:37] <phogg> Second, it will probably do some very clever things that won't work under Wine because Wine only implements Windows APIs enough to make well-behaved programs work, not to make deliberately-misbehaving programs work.
[04:33:01] <sheep> so it's unlikely that wine has the same vulnerabilities as windows, but there could be vulnerabilities in wine that windows doesn't have

[07:41:43] <SineDeviance> rascul: I kinda started explaining it up above, but here's an expanded explanation of the problem: when docking/undocking there is a random chance that the system will forget my monitor layout and a variety of strange things can also occur, i.e. in kde/plasma this manifests as having multiple 'blank' displays with no panels or widgets, just wallpaper and a mouse cursor. in kde/plasma in particular, no amount of fiddling with display settings and
[07:41:43] <SineDeviance>  trying to reset the primary display will 'fix' it and bring the panel and desktop icons back. this has happened in the other distros/DEs I mentioned above, but to varying degrees. some just forget the position of the displays and which one is primary, some will actually lock up one or the other display until I reboot, and other odd things have happened

[07:46:02] <rascul> i'm going away now though, maybe someone else can help
[07:46:12] <jim> jcass, I'm given to understand that when there are unroutable IPs (like the 192 thing you got, and that I got too), the original versions of talk can't deal with that... there are other talks, ntalk, ytalk
[07:46:16] <SineDeviance> rascul: unfortunately I don't have them anymore as I settled on fedora, but here's a person who has the exact same issue: https://www.reddit.com/r/kde/comments/jmr3hg/display_connected_to_docking_station_loses/

[07:48:33] <Cirrus_Minor> has

[14:25:12] <garylabronz> nmap.org

[14:25:35] <lockywolf> that is not helpful
[14:26:14] <garylabronz> i am not sure what you are trying to do, i presumed you wanted to check if your machines are alive.  so if ICMP is being blocked you can use nmap to check that
[14:26:30] <garylabronz> all depends on what you are trying to do

[15:34:56] <phogg> bewees: technically networkmanager *is* a script to set up your network. It's complicated, tries to be smart, and handles lots of scenarios. If your script isn't as smart or doesn't handle as many situations it might not work as well.
[15:34:58] <powerman2206> So y'all know when a URL has something other than http/s? Like irc://, for exaple? How do I change which commands/programs run when I open a link like that?
[15:35:26] <phogg> bewees: if your situation is quite simple, however, it might work better (because it doesn't need to check for or consider things that don't apply for you). YMMV.
[15:35:53] <phogg> powerman2206: depends on your desktop environment. Nominally xdg-mime controls that, but it has never ever worked for me.

[15:38:36] <phogg> powerman2206: on my system xdg-open is just a shell script and it tries to figure out what to do

[15:39:28] <powerman2206> Heh, every xdg thing is a script
[15:39:44] <bewees> phogg, Oh I see. In my case I need to setup VLAN tap devices, bridges and also a default PVID per specific tap devices which does not seem to be supported by NM or systemd-networkd. Not sure if I would encounter a situation where the script breaks.
[15:40:22] <phogg> bewees: I don't use nm so I can't tell you for sure, but my understanding is that bridge support was eventually added.
[15:41:14] <bewees> Maybe it is a good idea to let NM or systemd-networkd setup the network as much as possible and then run a script afterwards to configure what is missing?

[15:42:28] <phogg> if your needs are simple, or they are static and not dynamic, it is easier to disable both of those and do it manually. At least, it is for me
[15:43:01] <bewees> Yeah static network
[15:43:14] <phogg> then there's not much point in nm

[17:57:47] <Psi-Jack> chives: Well, at least you asked the right question the right way. I fun Fedora for desktop/laptop use, and primarily these days Debian for servers. I'd thought to go Ubuntu for some servers, but with the release of Debian 11, I realized Ubuntu LTS is just a stale snapshot that lasts for 2 years, while Debian, you can update specific parts more often than not.
[17:58:09] <Psi-Jack> And I still have a couple CentOS 7 instances running my BBS stuff, to which I'm hoping to migrate to Debian.

[17:58:29] <asgas> At least with ubuntu you can have select PPAs for more modern programs like blender or libreoffice.
[17:58:41] <alkisg> Psi-Jack: Ubuntu LTS is based on Debian testing, not on Debian stable
[17:58:49] <chives> oldgalileo:definitely because when you've been ground through it enough times you realize knowing a few tools deeper is much better than jumping through hoops on tools they are probably going to change faster than you can learn them anyway
[17:58:59] <Psi-Jack> asgas: And with Debian you can use backports for most things that matter, which are WAY more reliable than PPAs.
[17:59:01] <alkisg> So it usually starts newer than Debian, then ends up a bit older as time goes by

[17:59:49] <asgas> How would backports be more reliable than a ppa?
[17:59:52] <oldgalileo> chives: 100%. The last piece that I see in the age discrimination engine is "personal projects".
[18:00:00] <chives> because... it has to actually make sense somewhere somehow (i hope)
[18:00:12] <Psi-Jack> asgas: Because they're maintained by Debian people. PPA's are maintained by non-debian people, community people, which aren't always going to be as sane.
[18:00:42] <asgas> Well blender 2.93 isn't backported to debian 11 yet while I can setup ubuntu 20.04 and get 2.93 from a PPA.
[18:00:48] <B33F_1337> arch
[18:00:54] <oldgalileo> College kids who do nothing but CS for four years are bound to have a ton of personal projects they've worked on as they've learned, etc. So the expectation going into an interview is you maintain some incredible RTOS for self-driving milk delivery carts written in Rust that has been updated every day for the last two years.

[18:04:40] <asgas> The licensing for firefox clearly states you cannot use mozilla branding or names if you modify the program. Guess what debian wanted to do? Apply patches to stock firefox to improve it on debian. So they had no choice but to rename it to iceweasel.
