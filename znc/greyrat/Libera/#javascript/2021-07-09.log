[00:21:06] *** Joins: __jmcantrell__ (~weechat@user/jmcantrell)
[00:21:18] <GreenJello> jacekowski, the common theory is that the first month of the year is "January", and the index 0 refers to that (e.g. if you had an array of month names)
[00:21:34] <GreenJello> but the day of the month is just a number
[00:21:54] <GreenJello> it's not referring to anything else
[00:22:01] <GreenJello> day of the week is also 0 based
[00:22:42] <Maxdamantus> 0 is the natural starting number for sequences, but for "day of month", there's already an illogical but standard convention of starting from 1.

[00:24:30] <Maxdamantus> They didn't know about 0. There is no Roman numeral representation for 0. Our current Gregorian calendar system is mostly based on the Julian (Roman) calendar from those 2000 years ago or so.
[00:24:31] <GreenJello> everything is 1-based with human dates, even the year (the year zero doesn't even exist)
[00:24:55] <Maxdamantus> Indeed, they started counting from I.
[00:25:02] <Maxdamantus> I, II, III, IV, ...

[00:25:45] <Maxdamantus> The "1st" century started in "1". The "2nd" century started in "101". The "21st" century started in "2001".
[00:26:37] <Maxdamantus> If they had started from 0. We'd have had the "0th" century start in "0", the "1st" century start in "100" and the "20th" century start in "2000". But we didn't, so we add and subtract 1 to all these things.
[00:27:22] <Maxdamantus> 0 only started to be used in maths hundreds of years later.
[00:28:01] <hassoon> 0 based indexation exists in IT
[00:28:17] <hassoon> otherwisve instinctively people start from 1
[00:28:24] <entuland> uhm... I haven't ever seen anywhere that centuries start at 1, exception made for the very first one
[00:28:34] <entuland> Maxdamantus, do you have a reference about that?
[00:28:58] <entuland> cause as far as I know, the 20th century started on Jan 1st, 2000, not Jan 1st, 2001

[00:31:01] <hassoon> entuland: what us that supposed to mean ? 20th centry comes after the 19th, how is that related to 0 or 1 indexed maths ?
[00:31:07] <hassoon> what is *
[00:31:09] <ice9> entuland, no, the second one
[00:31:33] <entuland> ice9, sure, you can get files like that via ajax
[00:31:54] <entuland> hassoon, read the messages above by Maxdamantus, they said the century started on 2001
[00:32:01] <ice9> entuland, how they will be stored on the client side?
[00:32:17] <entuland> they won't, ice9, you normally get the data in a JS variable
[00:32:26] <entuland> what you do with that data, is up to your code
[00:32:31] <hassoon> ah ya, century naming convention is weird Maxdamantus
[00:32:45] <ice9> entuland, you mean a js var will carry the whole file content?
[00:32:54] <entuland> yes, ice9
[00:33:29] <entuland> could you elaborate better on what's your end real goal, ice9?
[00:33:34] <ice9> entuland, what is the maximum size of the file that can be in this case?
[00:33:48] <entuland> that I don't know

[00:35:48] <entuland> but you were just replying to my question I guess, so ignore that
[00:36:00] <Maxdamantus> entuland: on my phone now, so don't want to open links, but I imagine this should include the start date in the first paragraph: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/21st_century
[00:36:32] <entuland> if you are worried about the size check the specs to see if there is any mention of it, ice9
[00:36:44] <GreenJello> ice9, there isn't a specific limit, and you can break it up into multiple requests, which will let you load chunks of data into memory and pass to the encryption library
[00:36:49] <entuland> Maxdamantus, holy crap, I stand corrected
[00:37:29] <Maxdamantus> entuland: it has to have started in 2001, because based on the 1-based system, the 1st century started in 1, and the next century must have started 100 years later in 201.
[00:38:12] <GreenJello> ice9, I would probably do a max of a megabyte per chunk to avoid blocking the page while you decrypt a large chunk, and then adjust from there based on performance
[00:38:16] <entuland> I would have sworn that the only exception was the first century, going from 1 to 99, then the second century would have started on jan 1st, 100... my bad, Maxdamantus
[00:38:34] <hassoon> i rememver a bug that appeared in dating systems when 2000 came in and cause many problems for IT systems wordlwide
[00:38:39] <hassoon> remember *
[00:38:40] <Maxdamantus> Then the 1st century would have been less than a century.
[00:38:49] <hassoon> * caused *
[00:38:57] <entuland> hassoon, that bug was just about systems that were storing the year with 2 digits

[00:39:51] <GreenJello> ice9, also keep in mind that providing both the encrypted data and code to decrypt it at the same time means you could violate the user's trust and send the decrypted message back to your server
[00:39:58] <hassoon> entuland: alright then
[00:43:05] <entuland> now that I think about it better, it kinda makes more sense to have the century start on jan 1st of xxx1, I really can't believe I was hooked up on that xxx0

[00:44:50] <entuland> thanks for correcting that misconception of mine, Maxdamantus and Alexendoo
[00:45:32] <Maxdamantus> np. I'm strongly in favour of counting from 0 going forward though.
[00:45:52] <GreenJello> I think temporal does everything 1-based
[00:46:04] <GreenJello> for date
[00:46:18] <Maxdamantus> so whenever someone suggests something like 1-based indices or end-inclusive ranges, I'm quite willing to explain why that's bad.
[00:47:17] <Maxdamantus> (usually that explanation will involve pointing to the result of the centuries starting in years `(x - 1)*100 + 1` instead of `x*100`)
[00:50:11] <entuland> dunno, now that I see the rationale I kinda prefer the current strict interpretation

[00:58:39] <entuland> maybe this 0 vs 1 thingie is due to some implicit "ordinal" interpretation of year numbers?

[01:02:16] <Maxdamantus> but our ordinals conventionally (and ilogically) differ from that number by 1.
[01:02:17] <hassoon> starting from 0 is always nice
[01:02:59] <Maxdamantus> so converting from ordinal to measurement involves subtracting 1 and converting from measurement to ordinal involves adding 1.
[01:03:01] <stenno> y2k38 may be the actual y2k
[01:03:01] * hassoon pets 0-indexed for loop

[02:52:45] <Lewix> hello family
[02:52:49] <GreenJello> rndusr, you should be using addEventListener, and you can implement a function that adds a listener, and when it fires you can remove the listener
[02:53:00] <Lewix> any suggestion on how to refactor this? https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/NQQqRLyk/

[02:53:43] <GreenJello> I don't think so
[02:53:53] <GreenJello> and it'd have to be async anyways
[02:54:08] <GreenJello> you can implement a function like that which returns a promise
[02:54:44] <rndusr> oh great
[02:56:31] <GreenJello> Lewix, not sure if this is better, but: const newExercises = selectedExercises.filter((selectedUnitId) => selectedUnitId !== unitId);
[02:56:31] <GreenJello> if (newExercises.length === selectedExercises.length) { newExercises.push(unitId) }

[19:46:24] <austincheney> I can launch a remote http/ws server in chrome using --remote-debugging-port flag.  I can also inject files into pages using the CDP API Page.addScriptToEvaluateOnNewDocument.  If I want to output to a terminal application running on localhost how would I do that?
[19:47:21] <austincheney> Either I encounter problems with CORS or I can send from my injected script to the specificed backdoor port on localhost, but I don't know how to send from that port to my terminal application

[20:06:17] <austincheney> ljharb, because I work at a bank and it is a restrictive environment for security concerns
[20:06:46] <ljharb> a homegrown thing is always going to have more security concerns than a third-party thing
[20:06:56] <jaawerth> austincheney: you'd need *some* kind of third party executable to talk to the port though since you need some kind of tool to make a unix/tcp socket play nice with a websocket/http

[20:07:13] <ljharb> but fair, banks are bad at security in general, so a bank's security policies being this way are unsurprising
[20:07:15] <jaawerth> on linux you might be able to just use systemd-socket-proxyd or socat or something
[20:08:13] <jaawerth> if the terminal application can already speak in ws/http you could just have it talk to the debugger port directly, of course
[20:08:21] <austincheney> jaawerth, before that I need some way to get data out of the browser onto the terminal.  If I can do that I can do everything I need.

[20:09:27] <austincheney> jaawerth, I can send to the debugger port directly, but I cannot get data back to the terminal application from the browser.  The only thing I get back right now is network activity from the devtools envionrment related to CORS violations
[20:09:38] <entuland> not into these things at all, so bear with me - wouldn't some headless browser embedded in your own testing system simplify things?

[20:12:53] <austincheney> entuland, the connection point is remote access to devtools that provides access to the browser chrome, page, tabs, dev tools environment, DOM, security, and some other things.  There is a lot you can do with it and since they allow code injection into a page you can do even more with your own custom code than what the API provides, but I just can't get that information back to my test runner
[20:13:48] <entuland> gotcha
[20:14:15] <jaawerth> austincheney: cleanest way that comes to mind would be to implement a simple(ish) extension you can have more control over CSP and have access to more apis for talkign to the host system
[20:14:30] <austincheney> yeah
[20:15:14] <jaawerth> does just having the terminal app spin up a webserver with super permissive CORS headers not cut it in the context you're doing this?
[20:18:00] <austincheney> So I have attempted to inject an HTTP header into the page via CDP API that provides "Access-Control-Allow-Origin": `http://localhost:${serverAddress.port}` but that doesn't do anything

[22:12:02] <entuland> yep, that's mostly for user convenience, as you'd be hopefully doing proper validation on the server side, and you wouldn't be using that address for the real deal (only for the confirmation link) until they'll have confirmed

[23:16:00] <farn> Sounds like our client. But phrased differently, would it make sense to give the modal its own route? i.e. just append something
[23:16:35] <merpnderp> farn: the problem is this is a reusable search component to add user search in all our applets.
[23:16:56] <merpnderp> What good is a drop in component if it has to be wired into that local route space.
[23:17:25] <farn> Yeah, that wouldn't make sense
[23:18:42] <farn> Have you tried listening for `beforeunload`? I'm actually not sure whether that fires with the History API

[23:19:17] <merpnderp> Yeah, I'm just going to leave it as a teachable moment that the back button doesn't close modals.
[23:19:24] <merpnderp> or it does, just not the way they expected :D
