[14:48:38] <timsoftengTim[m]> hello. I've updated all plugins and looks like cmp freeze the neovim after each symbol. Is it known issue?
[14:52:23] <bloony> is there modes for the treesitter highlighting? Or is that all just the colorscheme used? Its a bit to much of a rainbow for me with all the colors
[14:52:44] <clason[m]> It's all dependent on the color scheme
[14:53:03] <clason[m]> tree-sitter just assigns syntax groups to certain ranges
[14:53:19] <bloony> okay, is there a list of treesitter color shceme somewhere?
[14:53:28] <clason[m]> there are no "tree-sitter colorschemes"
[14:53:56] <clason[m]> since the `TS*` groups are linked to the standard ones by default
[14:54:11] <clason[m]> so any colorscheme works with tree-sitter
[14:55:13] <bloony> ah right.. this claims to have "treesitter support" https://github.com/ellisonleao/gruvbox.nvim
[14:55:25] <clason[m]> yes, people like to claim many things...

[17:33:42] <clason[m]> to the LSP stuff introduced in 0.5

[17:34:00] <clason[m]> (tree-sitter remains experimental; no huge progress there)
[17:34:15] <clason[m]> same as vim.lsp.diagnostic, but centralized
[17:34:32] <clason[m]> (so other plugins can hook into it without needing to pretend to be an LSP server)
[17:34:44] <puremouron> so, it's quickfix ?
[17:34:47] <clason[m]> they're namespaced, too

[20:05:50] <bfredl> depends on the usecase :) if you literally want to process a buffer, then use `vim.cmd`
[20:05:58] <ii14[m]> mcepl: just use the command unless you want to do something more sophisticated
[20:06:04] <bfredl> while `vim.loop` is more flexible, and work with arbitrary data/callbacks

[22:21:53] <saltrocklamp[m]> in `:he :cexpr`, it says "the global value of 'errorformat'" is used - does that also apply to `:lexpr`? or if there is a buffer-local setting for `'errorformat'`, will that be used?

[22:48:55] <clason[m]> no worries
[22:48:56] <xsteadfastx[m]> pretty different to what im used to
[22:49:06] <xsteadfastx[m]> i think i now know what you mean
[22:49:19] <clason[m]> it's not very complicated (in fact, it's a really minimal language)
[22:49:44] <clason[m]> it just has one or two unusual pieces of syntactic sugar that can trip people up 
[22:50:22] <clason[m]> I really recommend "learning" Lua before trying to copy&paste config, it only takes a few minutes and will make things much easier
[22:50:30] <xsteadfastx[m]> it works now. thanks. now i have to find a way to get packer working somehow. if i press CR or d it doesnt really do anything. 
[22:50:34] <clason[m]> I recommend one of the links at the start of !guide

[22:55:39] <noex> also i love that bot
[22:55:57] <clason[m]> which doesn't really touch on the big ones (Lua, LSP, tree-sitter (early access), ...)
[22:56:25] <clason[m]> maybe look through the newsletters? https://neovim.io/news/archive/
[22:56:42] <clason[m]> especially the last two or three
[22:56:43] <noex> the only big one I know of is that neovim is community driven whereas vim has a gatekeeper deciding what gets merged? iirc
[22:57:20] <noex> at least i thought i read that somewhere
[22:57:27] <clason[m]> well, I wouldn't put it that antagonistically (Bram does a great job), but the community is indeed one of Neovim's greatest assets
[22:57:45] <clason[m]> for example, @smolck who made that bot ;)
[22:58:04] <noex> yeah, i struggled to word that sentence and make it not sound bad
[22:58:24] <clason[m]> you did a good job
[22:59:17] <clason[m]> it did not come across as troll-y or anything
[22:59:36] <Mathias[m]> Can I somehow get `expand` to give me the absolute path of a file before it exists on disk?
[23:00:26] <clason[m]> `nvim_buf_get_name`?
[23:01:07] <Mathias[m]> That's also only relative
[23:01:33] <clason[m]> noex: another is less (and less) concern for legacy compatibility (if that holds back useful new features)
[23:01:53] <noex> that actually makes sense
[23:02:40] <clason[m]> which for example translates going all-in on Lua as a scripting (and, incindentally, configuration) language over vim script (in particular, vim9script)
[23:03:55] <noex> hmm i kind of like that idea
