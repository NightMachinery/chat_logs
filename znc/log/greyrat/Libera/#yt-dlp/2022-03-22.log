[08:16:45] <brianx> i've been running something like: yt-dlp -4 -s "https://www.youtube.com/c/techlinked/videos" to get a list of public videos on a channel.  what i want is just the video id like: MlmOYmcK3sc and have no problem extracting it from the above but the performance of the command is really really slow.  is there a good (fast) way to list the video ids?
[08:16:47] <brianx> for example, a channel with just 36 videos takes over a minute and a half and --write-pages uses 36MB of disk, so it's clearly pulling a whole lot more than just the list of videos for some reason.
