[00:59:00] <MaNI> JFC, trying to figure out why I'm getting OOMs when 64gb really ought to be enough. Was it chromium? no. Was it firefox? no. Slack out of control again? no. Was it kdevelop using up 50gb of memory for its background parser because it had got hold of the (not used in the code I'm actually working on) millions of files in the "node_modules" directory that the nodeboi electron frontend pulls in when it builds itself? yes, yes it was
[01:04:31] <ERROH> is kdevelop nice these days?
[01:07:36] <T`aZ> i tried to use it last year, it OOMed after soem hours, on a pet project, without milions of files. Thus no, not usable at all. Maybe that has been fixed but i haven't checked
