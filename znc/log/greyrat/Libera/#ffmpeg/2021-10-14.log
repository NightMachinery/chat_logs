[04:15:22] <w00z1t> hello, using ffmpeg 4.2.4 on ubuntu concat a bunch of video files and the server kills the process which had taken all the mem and cpu.  what options can I apply to limit the load?
[04:28:00] <skybl[m]> you could change the nice value
[04:29:12] <hyrcanus> linux memory handling is a bit odd
[04:29:24] <hyrcanus> the nice value won't prevent an OOM-killer from reaping processes
[04:30:28] *** Quits: vlm (~vlm@user/vlm) (Quit: "")
[04:30:50] <DeHackEd> are you using the concat filter?
[04:31:51] <skybl[m]> hyrcanus: true
[04:33:04] <w00z1t> yes concat with like 300 short video files
[04:33:49] <w00z1t> what kind of args do I use with nice
[04:34:45] *** Joins: vlm (~vlm@user/vlm)
[04:34:56] <furq> nice -n19 ffmpeg ...
[04:35:02] <furq> it won't stop the oom killer though
[04:35:27] <furq> it's just thread scheduling priority
[04:35:59] <hyrcanus> you can disable the opportunistic memory reservation
[04:36:08] <hyrcanus> there's a lot of memory tweaks for linux kernel
[04:36:33] <hyrcanus> i'm just aware of them, not qualified to advise in their use though
[04:37:29] <furq> i would guess you're probably actually running out of memory
[04:38:56] <w00z1t> yep out of memory, the nice does not change the situation
[04:39:13] <hyrcanus> if you're concating that many files you might try concatenating in multiple passes
[04:39:24] <w00z1t> i need a different approach to globbing all the videos together
[04:40:50] *** Quits: shibboleth (~shibbolet@user/shibboleth) (Quit: shibboleth)
[04:41:31] <hyrcanus> if you can determine the format of the pieces to concatenate, you could generate them as mpeg-ts, i think?  which is headlerless?  and concat with filesystem tools?  (guessing)
[04:44:25] <hyrcanus> maybe this has revealed a problem in the ffmpeg concat filter furq
[04:44:50] <hyrcanus> are you invoking this with a script w00z1t
[04:48:22] <w00z1t> for a brief moment in htop i could see all the video files listed, just before it dies.
[04:50:25] <DeHackEd> I would use the concat file format instead, rather than the filter. you'll need to write a text file for it to read listing your files.
[04:53:12] <furq> use the protocol if you can yeah
[04:53:22] <furq> otherwise make sure you're on the newest version and make sure all files start at pts 0

[05:05:12] <skybl[m]> I'm running out of ways to make ffmpeg quickly extract the current frame from a stream on demand
[05:05:22] <skybl[m]> without it taking two seconds to start

[11:58:46] <fling> I just want fast encoding
[11:59:05] <furq> well 63 will be extremely low bitrate
[11:59:11] <fling> sweet
[11:59:16] <fling> will it complete faster? :D
[11:59:20] <furq> idk probably
[11:59:22] <furq> it'll look terrible
[11:59:34] <fling> so if the max slices is 8
[11:59:35] <furq> generally it takes less time to make something look terrible
[11:59:46] *** Joins: anotheruser (~user@192.210.199.34)
[11:59:51] <fling> then I could set both threads and cpu-used to 8 too?
[12:00:00] <furq> cpu-used has no relation to threads
[12:00:01] <fling> and encode 4 videos in parallel to saturate all 32
[12:00:04] <fling> hmmm
[12:00:18] <fling> what to set cpu-used to then?

[12:01:05] <furq> note the option names are different, the mappings are mostly (all?) listed in the ffmpeg docs
[12:02:39] <fling> sweet
[12:03:12] <furq> vp9 might actually be faster because the multithreading is slightly less awful

[12:03:29] <furq> but if you can do a lot of parallel jobs then that also works
[12:03:41] <furq> i doubt vpx vp9 scales to 32 cores on any job anyway
[12:04:39] <fling> wow the speed is actually good now
[12:05:02] <furq> yeah it will be if you wreck the quality
[12:05:04] <fling> between 80% and 140%
[12:05:11] <fling> when encoding with crf 63
[12:05:15] <fling> four videos in parallel
[12:05:21] <fling> maybe I can do diff crf too :D
[12:05:36] <furq> if these are supposed to be watched then that's probably a good idea
[12:07:13] <fling> same speed with crf 30
[12:07:37] <fling> hmm hmmm so all the magic happens in these slices / threads / cpu-used parameters then
[12:07:49] <fling> encoding 4 in parallel goes fast
[12:10:11] <fling> bitrate 10M and crf 10 is the same speed too
[12:10:55] <furq> i'd expect crf to have some effect but not as much as cpu-used
[12:11:10] <fling> I see drastic effect

[12:11:27] <furq> i mean to encode speed
[12:11:37] <furq> obviously it'll make a massive difference to quality
[12:12:01] <furq> with x264 higher crf values encode a bit faster with all other settings unchanged
[12:12:21] <furq> but then x264 has decent multithreading so that might explain it
[12:14:08] <hyrcanus> furq: do you know of a script that will do parallel encodes by segmenting a video, running multiple libx265 encodes, then concatenate them?
[12:14:16] <hyrcanus> should give better quality thyan threads
[12:14:25] <furq> i don't
[12:14:53] <fling> trying  crf 0
[12:15:03] <hyrcanus> should give me about 6% size improvement with same crf
[12:15:38] <furq> uh
[12:15:53] <furq> how've you worked that out
[12:18:31] <fling> the output is tiny even with crf 0
[12:18:35] <fling> vp8 is too strong wtf
[12:18:46] <furq> does it look any good
[12:18:50] <fling> probably my eyes are week also
[12:18:58] <fling> unfortunately yes :D

[15:03:26] <frojnd> Problem is that it only uses one nvidia gpu

[15:07:16] <fling> Will there be an efficient vp8 / vp9 encoder?
[15:07:20] <fling> av1 encoder? :D
[15:07:41] <fling> Will it require some fancy hardware anyway? opencl?
[15:07:43] <fling> cuda?
[15:10:33] <SimAV> fling, https://c3voc.de/wiki/_media/experiment:streaming_speeds.pdf << not vp8 but vp9. vp8 will be very likely not slower on these intel GPUs
[15:14:59] <SimAV> fling, the integrated GPU of a not-too-ancient intel CPU should be able to encode several 1080p25 streams to VP8 concurrently in realtime
[15:16:41] <BtbN> That's a weird graph. Why would you plot bitrate against speed?
[15:16:42] <SimAV> use -c:v vp8_vaapi to try encoding VP8 on the GPU
[15:17:18] <BtbN> frojnd, nvenc is a dedicated chip. One stream can by principle only use exactly one of those.
[15:17:19] <SimAV> BtbN, to see whether one can gain speed by choosing the output bitrate
[15:17:38] <BtbN> The bitrate is not involved with that whatsoever though
[15:17:43] <BtbN> as the graph shows
[15:17:58] <SimAV> BtbN, yes, but I guess someone wanted to check that empirically ;)
[15:18:15] <BtbN> You'd need to use encoder-specific quality and speed settings
[15:18:32] <BtbN> And/or actual output quality
[15:18:40] <SimAV> BtbN, the graph was linked from here: https://c3voc.de/wiki/experiment:encoding-quality
[15:18:42] <BtbN> The later is probably a bit easier to compare
[15:19:19] <frojnd> BtbN: interesting. As far as I know trans-coding is by far quickest with nvidia gpu(s) or is there faster method?
[15:20:08] <frojnd> I've also access to more powerful CPU systems like Intel(R) Xeon(R) Gold 6240 CPU @ 2.60GHz around 71 of  them
[15:20:11] <BtbN> generally, nvenc is considered the fastest for any given quality
[15:20:34] <BtbN> But x264/x265 will always beat it easily when your goal is maximum quality for a given bitrate
[15:20:38] <SimAV> IIRC i could gain still some FPS by decoding on an intel GPU while encoding on an nvidia GPU
[15:21:06] <BtbN> That'd seem weird. That's a lot of unneccesary copying of huge amounts of data
[15:21:32] <BtbN> Ideally you decode on the nvidia card, keep the frames in VRAM, and encode them there. If you REALLY need to transcode and can't just keep the original as is
[15:27:41] <SimAV> BtbN, I don't remember which of the two PCs it was where I conducted the test, but here are the figures I noted down when testing how fast I could transcode a h264: https://simeon.nlogn.org/share/20211014135517_ffmpeg_transcoding_speed.txt
[15:28:14] <SimAV> could even be, that i conducted the test on both machines and didn't see a significant difference
[15:28:29] <BtbN> the speed= metric you can just ignore, it depends on the framerate of the video more than anything
[15:28:31] <SimAV> well, my notes could have been more elaborated -.-
[15:28:50] <BtbN> if your video is just 30 fps the speed will double compared to a 60 fps video, despite the encoder going equally fast
[15:28:53] <SimAV> BtbN, I know. That's why the fps are noted frist
[15:29:33] <BtbN> The copy between CPU VRAM and NVidia VRAM can't be at all performant though
[15:29:41] <BtbN> pure on-GPU transcoding will perform better
[15:29:54] <SimAV> somehow this was faster than any ffmpeg line i could come up
[15:30:17] <SimAV> BtbN, is there a way to tell ffmpeg to decode on the nvidia-gpu and not copy back to ram?

[21:30:36] <w00z1t> i set the frame rate on the output and now am simply skirting process death

[21:36:39] <w00z1t> the messages said something about exceeding input framerates so i thought maybe i could constrain on the output to slow stuff down.

[21:36:57] <durandal_1707> using demuxer or filter?
[21:37:49] <w00z1t> filter, command is huge
[21:39:02] <durandal_1707> well, if you use bunch of files, you need to be aware that PTS values between audio and video should by in sync as max as possible
