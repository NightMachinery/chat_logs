[04:35:27] <kuudes> I just realized that that neural net imaging thingy, where you can alter the pov angle and nn interpolates how things looks, has some real military applications
[04:35:45] <kuudes> not in visual imaging but in radar imaging
[04:36:28] <kuudes> we can make fake radar responses, ghosts, by recording incoming radar ping sounds, and then replaying them back from different time, different place
[04:37:18] <kuudes> but the pov alteration would enable making a coherent "virtual reality" of the ghost, so that even if there are multiple receivers and senders, the virtual ghost locations and orientations could be kept coherent
[04:38:01] <kuudes> I guess a limitation is that you can at most make the ghost to be farther away than you in case you can't predict future pings
[04:38:18] <kuudes> but if you can predict future pings, you could also make the ghost appear more near than you yourself are

[07:35:08] <Obormot\Arcturus> Every time I deal with CORS and related shit, I always have the same thought: "this cannot possibly be anything even remotely like the best way to deal with these security issues"
[07:35:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> There's just no way
[07:35:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's such an insanely convoluted system
[07:36:20] <gwern> probably why the web keeps having security issues
[07:37:48] <Obormot\Arcturus> Like, just think about this bit: say you embed a page in another page, using an iframe. Ok. It's got a `sandbox` attribute, which either has an empty value (this means "allow nothing"), or its value can be a space-separated list of things to allow. Fine so far.
[07:38:15] <Obormot\Arcturus> One of the values is `allow-scripts`, which lets the page in the iframe run scripts. Cool, still fine.
[07:38:43] <Obormot\Arcturus> Another of the values is `allow-same-origin`, which... well, here's what the docs say:
[07:38:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> "If this token is not used, the resource is treated as being from a special origin that always fails the same-origin policy (potentially preventing access to data storage/cookies and some JavaScript APIs)."
[07:39:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> ... ok, that's... sort of borderline comprehensible?
[07:39:52] <saturn2> makes sense to me
[07:40:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> Anything not from the same origin (as the host page) can't... do... stuff (unspecified); if you don't allow-same-origin then it won't count as being from the same origin; therefore it won't be able to do... stuff (unspecified)
[07:40:09] <Obormot\Arcturus> Kind of fine?
[07:40:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> But then:
[07:40:51] <Obormot\Arcturus> Apparently if you set *both* `allow-scripts` and `allow-same-origin`, then ... the page in the iframe can *remove the `sandbox` attribute of its iframe*
[07:41:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> Which is not only not the same thing as having a blank value for `sandbox` but is in fact the *opposite* of that
[07:41:13] <saturn2> obviously
[07:41:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> And therefore lets the iframe do anything
[07:41:49] <Obormot\Arcturus> Who is going to realize this spontaneously? Without reading the docs?
[07:41:56] <Obormot\Arcturus> Who's going to remember this specific interaction?
[07:42:05] <adiabatic> not me
[07:42:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> (And is this even bad? In what cases is it bad?)
[07:42:29] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Who knows!)
[07:43:24] <saturn2> i'd actually say it's pretty surprising how well it all works considering it's the result of different browsers bolting on random crap over the decades and it's all set in stone once websites depend on any of it

[10:42:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> Programs are bestowed upon us by God himself

[19:12:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: (However what is interesting is that on LW, even though you get nothing but an error page, the webfonts *do* work. Which is not surprising in retrospect! Since they use TypePad, and Adobe can hardly keep CORS restrictions, else the service wouldn't work...)
[19:12:34] <gwern> what sort of thinking games would we nominate in the same vein as calibration training, prediction markets, Zendo, poker, or Factorio in terms of teaching ratonality skills?
[19:13:04] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: Which means that webfonts not working via the embed proxy isn't necessarily a universal issue - for some sites they might work. (Same with Google Fonts? Not sure, could be - keep an eye out for that)
[19:13:07] <two2thehead> feep, would probably know
[19:13:27] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: we don't have to worry about google fonts. the EU outlawed it donchaknow

[19:14:56] <two2thehead> huh...
[19:15:02] <two2thehead> yeah that could apply
[19:15:22] <kuudes> google fonts are ok but they should be served from site, not from third party google
[19:15:51] <kuudes> iirc I raised that question here already some half a dozen of years ago, but I feel uncertain
[19:16:01] <two2thehead> gwern, if factorio counts, does openttd count as well?
[19:16:40] <two2thehead> dwarf fortress?
[19:20:48] <PapuaHardyNet> I don't think factorio and dwarf fortress count. They are real time and therefore reduce the pressure on the player to *actually think*
[19:21:19] <Obormot\Arcturus> kuudes: By "Google Fonts" I specifically mean the service, not, like, "fonts made by Google"

[19:25:38] <PapuaHardyNet> nshepperd: the aim was to make the game easier than it actually seemed. So everytime you miss a 95% shot, the probability increases from 95% by, say, 1%. This continues until you get a shot.

[19:27:46] <kuudes> Obormot\Arcturus, indeed. cross site scripting requires assurance that the usage of the cross site resources won't be logged by the third party
[19:30:59] <Obormot\Arcturus> kuudes: Which of course is impossible; this sort of rule entirely breaks any kind of CDN, hosted fonts, hosted anything
[19:31:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> How can the host know what the client site will do?
[19:31:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> How can they stop me from logging the fact that you, the site visitor, have come to my site, and also that my site uses Google Fonts?
[19:32:39] <Obormot\Arcturus> I can just do "log('user kuudes visited my site'); log('by the way we made a request to Google Fonts, no relationship of this fact to the previous one, lol')"
[19:36:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> kuudes: Now don't get me wrong, my view of Google Fonts is somewhere between disdain and dislike, and ditto all sorts of centralized asset hosting, so I don't necessarily hate this state of affairs, but gwern is totally right in his "EU banned Google Fonts" assessment

(I reduced the white sugar by 1/4 c and they were still too sweet!) Next time I'd go with just 1/2 c each brown + white. The dryness, I dunno, maybe more butter? Maybe brown / chill (to re-solidify) the butter first? Not sure.
[19:42:28] <Obormot\Arcturus>  But not a big deal, with a cup of tea they're good. Texture is very nice, soft and fluffy, flavors complement each other very well. Overall, can recommend.
[19:42:28] <Robomot> Pumpkin Orange Cranberry Cookies Recipe (These soft, pudgy cookies have a ton of pumpkin flavor thanks to the boosting effects of orange. Tart cranberries provide occasional bursts of tartness and nutmeg, notes of fall.)
[19:45:10] <Obormot\Arcturus> Ralith: By the way, my homemade brown sugar worked out exceptionally well. I don't think I'm ever buying brown sugar again
[19:45:53] <Ralith> molasses+white? how's it differ?
[19:46:09] <Ralith> reducing sugar content will tend to make cookies drier, I think
[19:46:42] <Ralith> especially after sitting
[19:49:00] <kuudes> Obormot\Arcturus, they can't. and you can do that, there are legitimate interests in gdpr which allow that.
[19:49:14] <kuudes> but you have to use that information only for those aims, and you have to manage the info
[19:49:23] <kuudes> if the info is on third party, you can't manage it
[19:49:32] <kuudes> so you should not cause third party to have info
[19:49:45] <PapuaHardyNet> I see, so Google Fonts should be called by the server not the client
[19:49:49] <kuudes> but yes, I agree with the assessment that google fonts is banned
[19:49:51] <kuudes> PapuaHardyNet, yes
[19:50:26] <kuudes> also google could declare to never log google fonts use and verify this somehow
[19:50:36] <kuudes> but they want to log it
[19:50:41] <kuudes> because data is new oil etc
[19:50:45] <kuudes> and that is illegal
[19:51:34] <kuudes> we have known the state of affairs is this for years
[19:51:43] <kuudes> but only recently the court ruling came out of this
[19:51:53] <kuudes> this was predictable. google knew, everyone knew
[19:52:01] <Obormot\Arcturus> Ralith: Molasses + white, exactly. How does it differ? Well in theory, it doesn't! In my case what I actually did was I used pomegranate molasses (Turkish / Middle Eastern shops hereabouts carry it) - gives the sugar a nice tangy flavor (in this recipe in particular, works out great, offsets the lower acidity of butternut squash vs. pumpkin puree). But in general the answer is "you can customize like that", and also of course
[19:52:01] <Obormot\Arcturus>  "you can make as much as you need, whenever you need it" (so no worrying about "gotta buy more, but then I bought a bunch and it dried out, etc.")
[19:52:18] <kuudes> but because data is new oil, google, facebook etc have strong reason to pretend they don't understand the law
[19:52:49] <kuudes> but yeah, there just is no legal business case for offering a service with behavioural or personal data as payment.
[19:53:08] <kuudes> that may mean that facebook or google is not viable. so be it.
[19:53:38] <Ralith> Obormot\Arcturus: ah, that makes sense then
[19:53:54] <Ralith> interestingly flavored sugars can be good fun
[19:56:19] <Obormot\Arcturus> Ralith: And yeah, good point about the sugar content / dryness. This is the problem with so many of these American recipes - they're calibrated to such a high sugar content :|
[19:57:55] <Ralith> I guess more fat would be the best hope, but ofc that will impact texture substantially
[19:58:01] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yeah
[19:58:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> But you know, a slightly too dry cookie isn't the worst thing in the world. Eat 'em with milk, tea, you're g2g
[20:00:29] <Ralith> my favorite chocolate chip cookies are Stella's https://www.seriouseats.com/thin-and-crispy-chocolate-chip-cookies which are heavy on both sugar and butter and actually have a really delightful dense chewy texture, although +/- 30 seconds in the oven can be make or break
[20:00:29] <Robomot> Tate's-Style Thin and Crispy Chocolate Chip Cookies Recipe (If you love the chocolate chip cookies from Tate's Bake Shop, this copycat recipe delivers loads of buttery flavor and a delicate crunch.)
[20:01:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> Hmm, yeah I saw that recipe a while ago, def. should try it at some pont
[20:01:30] <Obormot\Arcturus> *point
[20:01:43] <Ralith> chocosphere sent me a sack of chocolate discs that are absolutely delightful in them
[20:02:19] <Ralith> nice big reservoirs of rich fruity goodness
[20:02:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> Oh yes I have a bunch of those, ironically I last used them in the other Serious Eats choc. cookie recipe that's like the opposite of that one
[20:02:55] <Ralith> relatedly, I tried out that hueg cookie recipe that came up here the other week and was rather underwhelmed
[20:03:02] <Obormot\Arcturus> The ones that are like "this cookie is intimidatingly large"
[20:03:07] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yeah those
[20:03:08] <Ralith> right
[20:03:15] <Obormot\Arcturus> Not the greatest cookies in the world, admittedly.

[21:47:14] <two2thehead> kuudes, s0ph1a feep : I just watched an hour and a half of tiktoks about 'what you learned from watching crime documentaries'. I have to say, women *really* love the true crime genre. I know of several surveys and studies mentioning this fact, but seeing so many different people talk about it really brought it home. They were 95% women. And since it was tiktok, I imagine the demographics were even more skewed.
[21:47:50] <feep> huh kay

[22:02:30] <PapuaHardyNet> "Strangely enough, learning about serial killers who had brutally murdered women actually felt cathartic, almost comforting.

[22:03:42] <two2thehead> PapuaHardyNet, I think I shared a study about it with dbohdan[phone] 
[22:03:55] <two2thehead> but specifically about horror films and the three types of fans
[22:04:12] <two2thehead> I imagine there is a similar function/overlap

[22:04:37] <dbohdan[phone]> Yep. But I can't find it, because I have no access to my logs.
[22:09:06] <dbohdan[phone]> I was briefly interested in true crime, particularly serial killers. I read some nonfiction and source documents like that FBI manual for catching serial killers. My interest faded when I realized how samey it all was. 
[22:12:34] <PapuaHardyNet> i wonder if taking estrogen makes you more interested in true crime
[22:13:37] <adiabatic> I dunno how much we can learn from the N=2 (at least) that we have here‚Ä¶
[22:13:45] <dbohdan[phone]> I haven't taken estrogen

[23:22:09] <adiabatic> Then I knew it wasn't me or mine.

[23:24:07] <adiabatic> I _think_ he's probably hitting limits in terms of how many glyphs can fit in each font file before font parsers start vomiting
