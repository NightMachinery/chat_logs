[00:00:07] <spxtr> depends on the speed/duration of the shock
[00:01:33] <Obormot\Arcturus> quanticle: *jealous*
[00:02:11] *** Quits: adiabatic (~adiabatic@user/adiabatic) (Ping timeout: 246 seconds)
[00:02:19] <spxtr> I am also jealous. We are nearly in summer mode here. It will be upper 80s later this week, mid 70s today.
[00:02:22] <kuudes> wintery
[00:06:20] <spxtr> my girlfriend studies shock waves in supernovae. feel free to ask any questions about how that stuff works and I can forward them
[00:07:12] <quanticle> I guess my question is still how is it possible for a pressure wave to travel faster than the speed of sound?
[00:07:54] <spxtr> how can a bullet travel faster than sound?
[00:08:30] <spxtr> if you somehow push the material that fast then it will continue to be faster than sound until it slows down
[00:08:46] <quanticle> Ohhh, okay
[00:09:15] <dTal> but that's surely not a pressure wave
[00:09:30] <quanticle> So basically, behind a shock wave, there's a vacuum or a near vacuum?
[00:09:37] <spxtr> not necessarily
[00:09:50] <gwern> 'abrupt, nearly discontinuous, change in pressure, temperature, and density'
[00:10:31] <spxtr> that's right. because you can't smoothly push the material in front of the shock out of the way, the pressure discontinuously jumps
[00:11:36] <quanticle> Okay, so it's like you just got hit with a moving wall of air
[00:11:40] <spxtr> yes
[00:11:50] <spxtr> imagine being shot by a blank. not pleasant, can kill
[00:11:56] <quanticle> Yeah
[00:12:46] <saturn2> a bomb is a solid object that abruptly changes into an extremely hot gas
[00:13:28] <saturn2> so there is suddenly way, way too much gas to fit in the space where the bomb used to be
[00:14:52] <quanticle> And as it expands, it pushes the existing air out of the way, at supersonic speeds, if the bomb detonates, rather than deflagrates.
[00:16:01] <spxtr> "extremely hot" in this case means "moving way faster than sound"
[00:18:12] <spxtr> I finally got around to reading EY's death with dignity joke(?) post.
[00:18:34] <spxtr> "It‚Äôs sad that our Earth couldn‚Äôt be one of the more dignified planets that makes a real effort, correctly pinpointing the actual real difficult problems and then allocating thousands of the sort of brilliant kids that our Earth steers into wasting their lives on theoretical physics." - can confirm, many many very smart people waste their lives on theoretical physics.
[00:19:15] <spxtr> Fortunately, there are so few academic jobs available that most of them are forced into the real world sooner or later.

[01:17:28] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: quick example since my links have expired: here's a desktop window height 880. a link in the middle of the page clobbers/hides itself: https://www.gwern.net/docs/www/misc/xwd-16490187202731224.png but at a bigger total height like 950px, there is always enough room for hte popin to avoid clobbering the target link: https://www.gwern.net/docs/www/misc/xwd-16490187682731973.png

[01:21:24] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: so I identify two separate bugs here: first, in the 880 height exaple, the popups should do a better job of choosing a position. it picks pretty much the worst possible position, right over the link, even though it could minimize the damage by going all the way up or down. second, there should be a minimum height requirement for popups (900px seems to be the minimum, 950px...
[01:21:30] <gwern> ...is more conservative), falling back/defaulting to popins for short windows

[04:35:40] <feepbot> correlates with the rise of the internet and online pornography. Of those born after the year 2000, just 1.04 per cent had found porn in a hedge. And how old were we when we were finding this stuff? Alarmingly young. Of course, people reported finding porn in the wild as an adult too, the oldest being in their 60s at the time, but the vast majority were between the ages of eight
[04:35:40] <feepbot> and 14. The youngest age reported was four. In fact, of the 1,944 people who reported they have found hedge porn, only 51 of them were over 18 at the time...The most commonly cited item was the pornographic ‚Äúgirlie‚Äù magazine; Fiesta, Penthouse, Playboy, Parade, Razzle, and Hustler, all repeat throughout the data. But it wasn‚Äôt all magazines, and it wasn‚Äôt all straight.
[04:35:45] <feepbot> Erotic books, playing cards, DVDs, and VHS recordings are all reported, both heterosexual and gay, as well as explicit photographs.

[09:01:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Yes, he wasn't convinced. No, it wasn't for anything resembling a good reason. No, his arguments don't make any sense.)
[09:02:46] <quanticle> >But we already have wars at the lowest rate in human history, such that a single aggressive war in one region is massive international news
[09:02:48] <quanticle> He's huffed way too many of Steven Pinker's farts
[09:03:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> Indeed
[09:03:54] <quanticle> Also, would it be out of line to suggest that the only reason we have so much international coverage of the Ukraine conflict is because it's white people attacking white people, and when we have similar wars amongst brown-people countries, no one in the US (or elsewhere in the West, more broadly) gives a shit?
[09:04:27] <quanticle> Like, when was the last time you heard anything about what's going on in Ethiopia?
[09:04:48] *** Joins: feep[work] (~mathis@195.50.168.194)
[09:04:50] <quanticle> Heck, I've been *looking* for news about the Tigray conflict, and there's slim pickings to be had.
[09:04:51] <adiabatic> a few days ago, when I heard someone say "wat about ethiopia"
[09:04:57] <quanticle> (And by slim, I mean none)
[09:05:23] <adiabatic> but yes, subsaharan Africans butchering each other is generally called "Tuesday"
[09:05:48] <quanticle> And from what I'm reading about Myanmar, that country is about to break into anywhere between three and five pieces, like a candy bar.
[09:05:55] <quanticle> But nope, Ukraine, Ukraine, Ukraine.
[09:06:01] <Obormot\Arcturus> quanticle: I already said something more or less like that
[09:06:13] <adiabatic> would everyone living there be better off if they broke up burma

[09:06:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Wikipedia has a neat article called ‚ÄúList of ongoing armed conflicts‚Äù. That‚Äôs a lot of armed conflicts! Notice two things:
[09:06:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> 1. Quite a few of them involve, let us say, non-consensual interaction of states or state-like entities.
[09:06:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> 2. The United States (and the rest of the Western world) is interfering in almost none of them, and certainly none of them are getting the sort of attention that Ukraine has gotten.
[09:06:25] <Obormot\Arcturus> Why is that? Are no international norms being violated? (Some of these conflicts are described with sentences like this: ‚ÄúAt least 10,000 people have died, and war rape became a "daily" occurrence, with girls as young as 8, and women as old as 72, raped, often in front of their families.[83][84]‚Äù) Or is it just that we (the United States) just don‚Äôt particularly care whether Sudan or Ethiopia ‚Äúwin‚Äù whatever spat
[09:06:25] <Obormot\Arcturus>  they‚Äôre having? Might that be why the epic clash between the heroic Ethiopians/Sudanese and the evil Sudanese/Ethiopians isn‚Äôt having quite the same impact on our politics, our discourse, etc.?"
[09:06:36] <adiabatic> seems like "india"/pakistan/bangladesh are all better off
[09:06:39] <quanticle> adiabatic: I have no idea, but it seems like that's what's about to happen, regardless of whether it would be good for anyone in the area or not.

[09:07:01] <adiabatic> Partition happened _once_, instead of being an ongoing thing
[09:08:01] <quanticle> I don't think the creation of yet another lawless buffer zone between empires is necessarily good, but I could be wrong. Maybe these buffer zone countries are like the grease in a mechanical system. They have to liquefy in order to keep the system as a whole from breaking.
[09:08:02] <ivan> Obormot\Arcturus: Europe has USG crawling over it and Ukraine is Europe-adjacent
[09:08:40] <feep[work]> is it ... news to people that morality is regional?
[09:09:03] <feep[work]> I thought this was just accepted status quo.
[09:09:15] <Obormot\Arcturus> ivan: y...yes. That's what I said
[09:09:31] <Obormot\Arcturus> feep[work]: Seems to be news to Scott!
[09:09:35] <quanticle> At least the British were explicit about it. They intentionally made Tibet, Afghanistan and Burma into lawless non-states in order to build up buffers between themselves and the Chinese, Russian and Chinese, respectively.
[09:09:54] <feep[work]> Obormot\Arcturus: I mean, to me the scott take has always been "morality shouldn't *ought to* be regional."
[09:10:08] <feep[work]> I don't know if you're replying to a specific thing here
[09:10:20] <feep[work]> but note that scott wrote Newtonian Ethics.
[09:10:26] <quanticle> feep[work]: You've heard of the is-ought fallacy, now witness the ought-is fallacy.
[09:11:29] <Obormot\Arcturus> feep[work]: Well, he sure isn't talking like he understands this
[09:11:36] <feep[work]> where?
[09:11:38] <Obormot\Arcturus> And yes I'm replying to a specific thing
[09:11:40] <Obormot\Arcturus> I linked it!
[09:11:45] <Obormot\Arcturus> Scroll up

[09:13:24] <feep[work]> thanks
[09:13:25] <Obormot\Arcturus> Might need to scroll up in that thread I guess
[09:13:29] <Obormot\Arcturus> There's some back and forth
[09:13:30] <quanticle> Yeah, I don't really have a lot more to add to what you wrote, Obormot\Arcturus.
[09:13:53] <feep[work]> yeah scott is just missing the african wars there I think
[09:14:00] <Obormot\Arcturus> (And Asian)
[09:14:20] <Obormot\Arcturus> (And... South American)
[09:14:21] <feep[work]> yeah
[09:14:41] <feep[work]> thouuuugh
[09:14:44] <Obormot\Arcturus> (And uh yeah basically Scott notices wars that involve white people. Sorry, but it's true)
[09:14:56] <feep[work]> I think we do need to consider 10k deaths a year in the historical context
[09:15:04] <feep[work]> it might still be the lowest it's ever been
[09:15:14] <feep[work]> I don't know, but it doesn't seem obviously false.
[09:15:23] <feep[work]> (relative to pop anyway)
[09:15:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> Well, Scott said "rates of wars"
[09:15:36] <feep[work]> true
[09:15:53] <saturn2> there was obviously a ton of covert activity going on behind the scenes between the united states and ukraine for many years
[09:16:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> This is a "fun" chart: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Conflict_Deaths_17_countries_per_year_2015-2020.png
[09:16:14] <Robomot> File:Conflict Deaths 17 countries per year 2015-2020.png - Wikipedia
[09:16:39] <feep[work]> I really want the preceding years tho.
[09:16:45] <feep[work]> preferably for two centuries.
[09:16:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> I mean, that would be a different chart
[09:16:56] <feep[work]> could do with four too
[09:17:16] <feep[work]> yes but that's the *interesting* chart.
[09:17:38] <feep[work]> we can quibble about definition of wars for hours, but what I care about, and presumably what scott cares about, or should care about, is qaly.
[09:17:48] <Obormot\Arcturus> https://www.vox.com/2015/6/23/8832311/war-casualties-600-years ... this seems like something I guess
[09:17:49] <Robomot> 600 years of war and peace, in one amazing chart - Vox (We're really lucky to be alive today, and not 200 years ago.)
[09:18:11] <feep[work]> oyeah this is what I was looking for
[09:19:09] <Obormot\Arcturus> Not really encouraging tbh
[09:19:13] <feep[work]> man look at that 1885 moment of peace tho <3
[09:19:33] * feep[work] googles 1885
[09:19:39] <feep[work]> > 1885 ¬∑ January 3‚Äì4 ‚Äì Sino-French War
[09:19:40] <feep[work]> yeah okay
[09:20:04] <Obormot\Arcturus> If anything it seems like it's been trending upwards over the last few centuries
[09:20:22] <Obormot\Arcturus> That right hand part of the chart is a lot denser
[09:20:23] <feep[work]> yeah but tho
[09:20:26] <feep[work]> look at that 1950 period
[09:20:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> And a lot of stuff higher up
[09:20:56] <Obormot\Arcturus> I'm pretty unimpressed
[09:21:11] <feep[work]> eh, I find it inspiring
[09:21:22] <saturn2> obviously there are fewer wars when one empire is too dominant for anyone to challenge and more wars when there's a struggle between two or more

[09:21:33] <feep[work]> just two blocks of what the fuck, and then everyone starts chilling out
[09:21:38] <Obormot\Arcturus> Nope, not encouraging at all
[09:22:13] <feep[work]> trends look good tho!
[09:22:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> They do not
[09:22:19] <feep[work]> do to me

[09:22:27] <saturn2> people are still people, they haven't chilled out

[09:22:42] <saturn2> nope
[09:22:55] <feep[work]> Obormot\Arcturus: any page that doesn't account for world pop is silly.
[09:23:04] <feep[work]> that's why I like your chart.
[09:23:11] <saturn2> it's just been dominated by a stronger power
[09:23:29] <feep[work]> ehh.
[09:23:47] <feep[work]> saturn2: obv we lack the counterfactual europe to disprove this
[09:23:58] <saturn2> do you think those hundreds of american military bases are just there to look pretty
[09:24:03] <feep[work]> but I think the reaction to ukraine is so strong precisely because it's war in europe

[09:24:14] <feep[work]> saturn2: I mean   yes
[09:24:29] <Obormot\Arcturus> Awful lotta these in the late 20th century
[09:24:31] <feep[work]> to a first approximation, yeah
[09:24:53] <Obormot\Arcturus> There's one that's going on now!
[09:24:56] <feep[work]> Obormot\Arcturus: again, normalize by world pop.
[09:24:57] <saturn2> well yeah they are *now* and that's why wars are starting up again
[09:25:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> Killed a whole lot more people than the Ukraine war has
[09:25:07] <Obormot\Arcturus> A whoooole lot more
[09:25:20] <Obormot\Arcturus> Where's the 24/7 news about it, eg
[09:25:22] <Obormot\Arcturus> *eh
[09:25:22] <feep[work]> yes I agree that we should care about this
[09:25:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> Who here even knows what I'm referring to off the top of their head!
[09:25:42] <feep[work]> I certainly don't!
[09:25:58] <feep[work]> but like, what are you even accusing people of here?
[09:25:58] <Obormot\Arcturus> mmhm
[09:26:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> People *here*, nothing
[09:26:10] <feep[work]> hypocrisy? yeah no shit, *we have known this for decades*.
[09:26:12] <feep[work]> even people out there.
[09:26:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> I am accusing Scott, specifically.
[09:26:52] <feep[work]> okay this is weird, I'mma go get a sandwich
[09:26:57] <Obormot\Arcturus> He damn well knows better than that "Ukraine is international news, THEREFORE there's basically no war anymore" bullshit
[09:26:59] <saturn2> it's fine to think what the powers that be want you to think, there is generally no benefit to doing otherwise
[09:27:03] <feep[work]> and continue pestering people to let me port haskell lenses to D
[09:27:19] <feep[work]> Obormot\Arcturus: fwiw I do think there's truth to this.
[09:27:35] <saturn2> except that it can be an interesting hobby if it interests you
[09:27:46] <feep[work]> like, within the nato-centric framing it still communicates a true belief, it's just not the literal meaning of the words.
[09:27:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: I think, more relevantly here, is that I can't do anything about any of this, so it's fine for me not to know about this stuff
[09:28:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: BUT, if you're gonna go and blog about this kind of thing for money, then yeah you better not make such absolutely basic mistakes, imo
[09:28:32] <feep[work]> understanding why it *feels like* there's been no serious war for 70 years
[09:28:33] <saturn2> well, no, you have to know about this stuff so you can be an engaged and active citizen in this wonderful democracy we have
[09:28:38] <feep[work]> understand*
[09:28:43] <Obormot\Arcturus> feep[work]: To whom does it feel that way?!
[09:28:48] <feep[work]> and you will understand why the western world is reacting like this.
[09:29:00] <feep[work]> I mean, to me, for one.
[09:29:10] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: lol :\
[09:29:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> feep[work]: The answer to that one is "Uncle Sam sure is good and making sure we don't get attacked", right
[09:30:04] <feep[work]> sorta? but I really do think it's just a question of ideological proximity.
[09:30:15] <Obormot\Arcturus> feep[work]: "Thank god for all them productive Americans working themselves to death so their taxes can fund sooo many aircraft carriers and stuff"
[09:30:16] <Obormot\Arcturus> etc.
[09:30:23] <feep[work]> I mean, for instance, israel has wars, but I don't think anyone is expecting them to lose them.
[09:30:30] <Obormot\Arcturus> Uh
[09:30:49] <Obormot\Arcturus> I mean, you know I <3 Israel and have a high opinion of their competence in war, but
[09:31:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> That expectation *just might* have something to do with how much aid we send them
[09:31:09] <feep[work]> I mean, *because* to fight israel ultimately means to fight the US.
[09:31:15] <Obormot\Arcturus> To help fund their not losing of wars
[09:31:32] <feep[work]> but like, pricing that in, it sure seemed like all the western sphere of influence was pretty safe!
[09:31:43] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's still pretty safe
[09:31:52] <feep[work]> it's still pretty safe
[09:31:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> Nothing's changed
[09:32:07] <feep[work]> but ukraine was a lot closer to us than any country that had genocides or wars
[09:32:10] <feep[work]> for 70 years.
[09:32:21] <feep[work]> spatially closer, contextually closer, ideologically closer.
[09:32:33] * quanticle whispers "Racially closer"
[09:32:38] <feep[work]> yes, of course. that too.
[09:33:07] <feep[work]> that's why all the russian rhetoric about how these people are really russians is so effective
[09:33:12] <feep[work]> and why the west was fairly chill about crimea
[09:33:16] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yeah I mean there's no mystery here, just "an entire generation growing up with a giant pile of privilege, then seeing a faint hint that maybe possibly there was a remote possibility that perhaps that privilege might be eroded somewhat maybe, and *absolutely losing their shit*"
[09:33:22] <feep[work]> I mean
[09:33:23] <feep[work]> yes.
[09:33:29] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yeah we all know that already :p
[09:33:34] <feep[work]> I think that sentiment is valid.
[09:33:40] <feep[work]> privilege just means that good things happen to you.
[09:33:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> I think that sentiment is absolutely laughable and contemptible
[09:33:47] <feep[work]> good things happening to people, all else being equal, is good.
[09:34:22] * feep[work] shrugs
[09:34:42] <Obormot\Arcturus> (oh there's actually multiple genocides going on right now)
[09:34:44] <feep[work]> to be clear, the giant pile of privilege here is not having wars.
[09:34:53] <Obormot\Arcturus> (at least two)
[09:35:37] <feep[work]> I quite like that privilege.
[09:35:44] <feep[work]> I mean, who wouldn't.
[09:36:10] <feep[work]> I mean if we're saying that the ongoing genocides are bad we sort of have to embrace that not having genocides is a good thing
[09:36:15] <feep[work]> as a baseline
[09:36:33] <feep[work]> and so it's like "how dare you enjoy cake while the peasants are starving", which, you know, fair
[09:36:48] <feep[work]> but the solution is certainly not to sneer at people for liking cake. cake is tasty!"
[09:36:48] <saturn2> i really don't think the west (aka america) did everything it could to prevent this war... rather the opposite
[09:36:53] *** Joins: dbohdan[phone] (uid547665@id-547665.uxbridge.irccloud.com)
[09:37:14] <feep[work]> I just want to preserve the baseline notion that cake is good.
[09:37:22] <Obormot\Arcturus> feep[work]: The rest of the world would be more sympathetic if (a) NATO-sphere Europe were *actually* in any substantially elevated danger, and if (b) NATO-sphere Europe ever gave two shits about anywhere else while that privilege didn't even look like it might possibly be threatened, and also also, if (c) anyone thought that NATO-sphere Europe is going to now start giving two shits about anywhere else now that their privilege
[09:37:22] <Obormot\Arcturus> -bubble has felt the gentle touch of what isn't even a needle but more like a feather
[09:37:34] <feep[work]> Obormot\Arcturus: I mean, I'm not trying to make an argument to the rest of the world here
[09:37:51] <Obormot\Arcturus> Anyway, as I was saying, Scott should damn well know better
[09:37:56] <feep[work]> I'm trying to explain where this sentiment comes from and why it's valid at root.
[09:38:04] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's not valid!
[09:38:07] <feep[work]> it is! 
[09:38:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> No it's not
[09:38:21] <feep[work]> if you want to get *anywhere* with "let's have less genocides", you need to *kindle* this flame, not snuff it out.
[09:38:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> Opposite
[09:38:41] <feep[work]> the feeling at the heart of this is the *right* feeling.
[09:38:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> Also no
[09:39:08] <feep[work]> I'm not sure I can argue convincingly on this.
[09:39:13] <feep[work]> It's kinda too basic a premise for me.
[09:39:31] <feep[work]> like, yes ... obviously wanting to not be in war is what you use to justify helping to reduce wars?
[09:39:52] <Obormot\Arcturus> Who's helping to reduce wars?
[09:39:58] <feep[work]> nobody, because people are hypocrites
[09:40:03] <feep[work]> we already established this
[09:40:05] <saturn2> who is helping to reduce wars?
[09:40:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> Nothing that anyone even remotely involved in this is helping to reduce wars
[09:40:15] <Obormot\Arcturus> So clearly
[09:40:30] <Obormot\Arcturus> "wanting to not be in war" is failing to justify helping to reduce wars
[09:40:35] <feep[work]> I mean, we're in the punishment altbranch, so this wouldn't reduce wars directly
[09:40:40] <Obormot\Arcturus> So that "obviously" doesn't seem so obvious after all
[09:41:02] <Obormot\Arcturus> feep[work]: I'm referring to the strategy as a whole
[09:41:05] <feep[work]> like, if russia nukes you and you nuke them back
[09:41:11] <feep[work]> obviously this is not a world with minimized genocides
[09:41:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yeah but that's not actually what's happening here
[09:41:26] <feep[work]> that's what it's being perceived as.
[09:41:39] <Obormot\Arcturus> Incorrectly
[09:41:42] * feep[work] shrugs
[09:41:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> Which is why I say that sentiment is not valid
[09:42:00] <feep[work]> we may have a different meaning of valid
[09:42:14] <feep[work]> anyway seriously need to cut this short, work to be done, I'mma switch irssi window :v
[09:42:26] <feep[work]> ya'll are too interesting! way too interesting :v
[09:42:31] <Obormot\Arcturus> Here's the difference (feel free to scroll up and read later I guess):
[09:42:34] <feep[work]> &2
[09:42:35] <feep[work]> er

[10:09:48] <Obormot\Arcturus>  conducive to atmospheric circulation, which ordinarily prevented high concentration of smog within the city.[17] As such, the problem was mostly invisible most of the time.[19] While Los Angeles is surrounded by mountains that tend to trap airborne pollutants, New York City's open topography and favorable wind conditions usually disperse pollutants before they can form concentrated smog. If a city with the climate and
[10:09:48] <Obormot\Arcturus>  landscape of Los Angeles had had the high emissions of mid-1960s New York, rapid accumulation of airborne pollutants would have quickly rendered it uninhabitable.[17]" ... whew

[11:23:20] <Robomot> bsbbtnh comments on A Dead Man's Switch Method of Insuring Against Dementia (In the Netherlands, the desire of your younger self is followed, based on what the doctor interprets that as. There was a case a few years back...)
[11:24:01] <capisce> "There was a case a few years back where a woman who was diagnosed with dementia said she wanted to be euthanized when she felt the time was right. 4 years later she was put in a care home, the senior doctor decided that was the right time, even though the woman didn't want to die."
[11:25:44] <quanticle> Well, maybe she shouldn't have said that she wanted to be euthanized when the time was right, then?
[11:27:49] <capisce> it seems she said she wanted to be euthanized when _she_ felt the time was right
[11:29:15] <quanticle> Which she?
[11:29:27] <quanticle> The sane she who made the decision? Or the one with dementia?
[11:30:59] <quanticle> I mean, I agree that this could have been explained better. Maybe if the person who set up the living will had explained, "Okay, but you do realize that you're consenting to being killed without your consent in the moment, right?" she would have made a different choice.
[11:31:11] <quanticle> Or set up more conditions around when it was all right to kill her
[11:32:32] <quanticle> >I worry that this basically means that any dementia patient who has expressed a desire for euthanasia will basically be guaranteed a lethal injection on admittance into a care home
[11:32:38] <quanticle> And what, exactly is the problem with this?
[11:32:53] <quanticle> Like, my mom has said already, "Do what it takes to make sure I don't end up in a nursing home"
[11:33:21] <nshepperd2> i mean if you don't specify when "the time is right" is, probably some random doctor shouldn't just decide for you
[11:33:30] <quanticle> If the prospect of ending up a drooling mess in a nursing home is that awful, then yeah, you ought to be euthanized.
[11:34:34] <capisce> are nursing homes only for drooling messes?
[11:35:10] <quanticle> I don't know how it works in Europe, but here in the US they tend to be, yeah.
[11:35:25] <quanticle> Nursing home means you're on your last legs.
[11:35:51] <quanticle> And of course, if you're all right with being in a nursing home, well, no one is forcing you to ask for euthanasia.
[11:36:29] <quanticle> You can just do nothing and end up with the default outcome, which is that people will work heroically to prolong your life, even when that causes nothing but pain, fear and confusion for you.
[11:39:05] <saturn2> there should be more options for extremely risky but not instantly fatal recreational activities that seniors can do
[11:39:05] <quanticle> What if they'd decided and injected her with the fatal drug when she was sleeping and she'd died peacefully?
[11:40:26] <nshepperd2> > The 74-year-old patient, who died in 2016, had expressed a wish to be euthanised but also indicated that she wanted to determine the right time. 
[11:41:07] <capisce> so it seems she had not yet determined the right time
[11:41:16] <quanticle> So your argument is that, because the dementia accelerated before she could fill in when the right time was, she shouldn't have been killed?
[11:41:26] <nshepperd2> there's gotta be more to this story bc what i'm getting from this is that they took a statement equating to "i wanna die at some point, i'll let you know when" and took that as permission to just kill her whenever they wanted
[11:41:42] <nshepperd2> which obviously isn't what she meant lol
[11:42:45] <nshepperd2> quanticle: yes
[11:42:58] <nshepperd2> if she didn't specify what to do in the case of a sudden acceleration of dementia, then it shouldn't be assumed that the answer is 'lethal drugs'
[11:43:22] <saturn2> you can't just say "i wanna die" where a doctor can hear you and expect them not to kill you
[11:44:09] <quanticle> "However, the daughter of the deceased woman thanked the doctor. 'The doctor freed my mother from the mental prison which she ended up in,' she said in a statement."
[11:44:11] <quanticle> Either this daughter is inheriting a *lot* of money, or there's more to the story, as you said.
[11:44:12] <nshepperd2> i know right, its like going to the hospital and expecting them not to disassemble your body for its organs
[11:44:22] <nshepperd2> its just not utilitarian

Jews are barred out, but it is an arbitrary ruling. I know lots of Jews who are born Nazis and many others who would heil Hitler tomorrow morning if given a chance. There are Jews who have repudiated their own ancestors in order to become ‚ÄúHonorary Aryans and Nazis‚Äù;

His brain operates quite apart from the rest of his apparatus. He will certainly be able, however, fully to explain and apologize for Nazism if it ever comes along. But Mr. G is always a ‚Äúdeviationist.‚Äù When he played with communism he was a Trotskyist; when he talked of Keynes it was to suggest

He had to return home. I recall asking him if he regretted it and wouldn't have done it if he could turn back the clock, and his response was affirmative. However, my memory is unreliable -- which is why we must consider 
[18:04:08] <PapuaHardyNet> this bet annulled.
[18:05:24] <PapuaHardyNet> I don't have conversation logs with him because Element deletes logs for "rooms" you leave. I have screenshots of adjacent facts being admitted but not the core claim that he regretted it.
[18:06:45] <gurkenglas> PapuaHardyNet: we don't have to consider it anulled, we can make use of the probability you place on your memory being correct here.
[18:09:14] <gurkenglas> If I remember correctly, we were doing a preliminary resolution in january because we had gained information. that involved me setting up a wallet
[18:09:55] <PapuaHardyNet> huh, you are right about the possibility of us using probability, but that's a lot of leeway you give me. I'd say my memory of him claiming he regretted it is ~70% accurate? I'm unsure why I didn't screenshot it which reduces the probability by a huge amount, but doesn't reduce it under 50% since I have been going through life for months believing I won the bet.

[19:36:56] <two2thehead> This seems obvious, but has anyone thought of this?
[19:37:54] <two2thehead> 'Many online auctions use proxy bidding, an iterative sealed bid auction where winners pay a fixed increment over the second highest bid. The auctioneer does not disclose the current maximum bid, but the second highest bid is always public.'

[21:25:04] <gwern> "A drowning man will suck on a straw." 
[21:25:08] <Obormot\Gaia> gwern: What you describe is of course doable but I have objections:
[21:25:27] <Obormot\Gaia> gwern: 1. This applies to Wikipedia links, yes? Replacing the dotted-underline styling?
[21:25:50] <Obormot\Gaia> gwern: 2. This relies on a distinction in people's minds between "a popup that is an annotation" and "a popup that is something else", which doesn't exist
[21:26:03] <gwern> Obormot\Gaia: no, we'd leave WP alone. no reason to change it regardless of the hooks
[21:26:08] <Obormot\Gaia> But why
[21:26:11] <Obormot\Gaia> That's just confusing then!
[21:26:33] <feep> gwern: these are amazing
[21:26:36] <Obormot\Gaia> How can you expect people to understand what specific types of popups the vertical lines mean, if sometimes there are popups without any vertical lines at all
[21:26:39] <feep> is this gpt?
[21:26:58] <gwern> feep: all of this is dumped from that subreddit. pretty much none of the GPT completions are malaphors
[21:27:10] <gwern> it either repeats regular idioms, or repeats the prompt
[21:27:19] <feep> oh I see. aw.
[21:27:23] <gwern> Obormot\Gaia: why would this change WP at all? this objection applies just as much to the current one
[21:27:30] <Obormot\Gaia> gwern: It sure does
[21:27:38] <Obormot\Gaia> gwern: And I've made that objection, you will recall
[21:27:41] <Obormot\Gaia> But this makes it worse!
[21:27:47] <feep> yeah it doesn't get the jokes.
[21:27:52] <feep> probably cause it needs self-awareness
[21:28:00] <Obormot\Gaia> Because now you're trying to pack even more meaning into that vertical line... while still totally undermining it with WP links
[21:28:48] <Obormot\Gaia> gwern: Ask your readers whether anyone has any idea whatsoever what the different kinds of hooks/lines mean, *now*, and whether people spontaneously distinguish between "annotation popups" and "other kinds (?) of popups"
[21:28:49] <gwern> feep: yeah, it's disappointing. it doesn't rely on phonetics so I did expect GPT-3 to get it. although davinci-plus seems to do a bit better: https://www.gwern.net/docs/www/misc/xwd-16490914783273263.png (what is davinci-plus? I have no idea. it's some prototype OA gave me access to)
[21:28:49] <Robomot> image/png (1798x1080; 151 KB)
[21:28:57] <Obormot\Gaia> gwern: Bet you'll be disappointed!
[21:29:44] <gwern> Obormot\Gaia: I think it makes it better because it's more consistent. now the lines lack the weird context-specific omission where a bottom hook meant popupable but a top hook erased that and may or may not be popupable
[21:29:57] <Obormot\Gaia> errr what
[21:29:58] <Obormot\Gaia> No
[21:30:04] <Obormot\Gaia> All links with hooks are popupable
[21:30:06] <Obormot\Gaia> *All*
[21:30:35] <Betawolf> "One brick in the wall at a time" is pretty good
[21:30:36] <Obormot\Gaia> A link has a hook only if (but not necessary if, due to the WP exception) if it spawns a popup
[21:30:39] <gwern> Obormot\Gaia: now it's simple. is there a top line? it has an annotation. is there a bottom line? it has popupability. does it have both? then it has an annotation *and* popupability reached through the annotation
[21:30:50] <Obormot\Gaia> You're not getting it, gwern
[21:31:01] <Obormot\Gaia> Nobody thinks of "annotations" as something different from "popups"
[21:31:10] <Obormot\Gaia> You mouse over a link, it spawns a popup
[21:31:12] <Obormot\Gaia> That's the UX
[21:31:24] <Obormot\Gaia> That's literally the user's experience of what is happening
[21:31:30] <Obormot\Gaia> Phenomenologically speaking
[21:31:57] <Obormot\Gaia> "oh, an annotation, I thought for sure it would be a *popup* instead, which this is not" said nobody ever
[21:32:31] <Obormot\Gaia> Do a poll if you don't believe me!
[21:32:56] <gwern> at that level, it's still the same. before: "does this have a little vertical line on it? then mouse-over will do stuff" after: "does this have a little vertical line on it? then mouse-over will do stuff"
[21:32:57] <Obormot\Gaia> (Making sure not to prime people with the conceptual distinction, that would be spoiling the data)
[21:33:29] <kuudes> did sonyasupposedly get a cat btw? toxoplasmosis?
[21:33:31] <Obormot\Gaia> gwern: Yeah but now it'll look like the line is rendering in different places sometimes - same line, visual glitch
[21:33:48] <Obormot\Gaia> gwern: (It's not like there isn't precedent, right?)
[21:34:40] <Obormot\Gaia> "dude can't even render this line consistently, lol, it's all over the place" is gonna be the reaction of a lot of people
[21:34:49] <gwern> sure, in isolation it may look like a glitch, but I think in context, with a lot of links (as usual), the deliberate pattern may be obvious
[21:34:56] <Obormot\Gaia> *doubt*
[21:35:49] <gwern> let's see how it looks on a page with a mix like /Clippy's first screen
[21:35:52] <Obormot\Arcturus> Hell, that screenshot looks to *me* like a couple of the links just have a positioning glitch
[21:35:58] <Obormot\Arcturus> But ok sure
[21:36:31] <gwern> Obormot\Gaia: yeah, because it lacks the third pattern of annotation+live which completes it. I just couldn't figure out the priorities and class overrides
[21:36:48] <gwern> Betawolf: '"If you live with a mule, the mule doesn‚Äôt have to brag" "There‚Äôs light at the end of the tunnel to get water from a stone" "One brick in the wall at a time."' those seem like they work...
[21:37:57] <gwern> Betawolf: "You can get a lot of friends for a sandwich, but never a sandwich for your friends." not sure if that's a malaphor but it's funny and seems to be original
[21:39:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: Here's my question: what the heck makes you think that the bottom hook maps to "live"?
[21:39:29] <PapuaHardyNet> spxtr: I think the problem is that theoretical physics has an extremely high amount of prestige due to 20th century achievements (the nuclear bomb). AI research is still on the "early adopter" end of the curve at this point (there won't be a "lagging indicator" because we'll either have FOOM, overlord, or paperclip-land after that)
[21:39:38] <feep> I'm not supposed that gpt has problems with "the phrase must trigger the classifier twice"
[21:40:04] <feep> surprised*
[21:40:09] <feep> ah my network is bugged
[21:40:26] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: perhaps 'raw' or 'fulltext' would be a better term? it's either a copy of the original document (like a local PDF or a local HTML snapshot) or it's the remote live URL, also 'fulltext' or 'raw' (well, unless we start using reader-mode etc)
[21:40:33] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: Also no
[21:41:08] *** Quits: voltage_ (voltage@user/voltage) (Quit: Leaving)
[21:41:24] <gwern> Betawolf: yeah, davinci-plus definitely gets the *idea* unlike instructgpt, although it still isn't able to really do a good job: https://www.gwern.net/docs/www/misc/xwd-16490920983274484.png https://www.gwern.net/docs/www/misc/xwd-16490921373274618.png https://www.gwern.net/docs/www/misc/xwd-16490922293275051.png

[21:42:25] <spxtr> PapuaHardyNet: Ehh, I'm not so sure it has anything to do with prestige. Theorists do what they do because they love it.
[21:42:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> In fact it is: backlinks, or similar links, or it's some variety of "the content" (which could be all sorts of things)
[21:42:40] <Obormot\Arcturus> Or possibly it's a part of the current page!
[21:42:51] <feep> oyeah it's getting it! nice
[21:43:00] <PapuaHardyNet> you think they'd be able to do it without the funding and the society subsidizing them?
[21:43:11] <spxtr> Mostly not, no.
[21:43:18] <feep> I like "one foot in the grave, the other in the frying pan."
[21:43:29] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: those are also 'raw' or 'fulltext'. they present the entire document without any attempt to annotate it. the backlinks/similar-links is just the full list, period; the popped up section is just the full section (with the whole page scrollable etc)
[21:43:36] <PapuaHardyNet> well then, prestige is what gives you access to funding and societal subsidies
[21:43:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: Really stretching it for the backlinks/similar
[21:43:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> reeeeaaally stretching
[21:44:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> Ain't nobody gonna make that connection
[21:44:10] <gwern> there is no more raw and unannotated form of the backlinks document than just popping it up!
[21:44:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> -_-
[21:44:22] <gwern> that's it. that's the whole document. there's nothing more to it
[21:44:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> That's post hoc logic of the highest order
[21:44:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> The more natural mapping is "data" and "metadata"
[21:45:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> "stuff" and "about stuff"
[21:45:38] <gwern> feep: yeah, I think a couple of these could work as submissions but I don't want to go through and curate and hand-check for originality. maybe you or Betawolf can do so? after all, I did the rest of the work (and probably spent at least $0.10 since I was bruteforcing with BO=20)
[21:47:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: Here's what would really reduce clutter: keep the bottom hook as-is; remove the top hook; replace it with the dotted-underline, which now means "annotation of any sort, possibly via WP or maybe otherwise"

[21:48:07] <spxtr> PapuaHardyNet: It's not pure prestige. Funding comes from tentative future promises of technology and publications. There is some historical basis sure, and high energy particle physics particularly is riding on that, having failed to do anything new for decades.

The span of recorded history is roughly 5,000 years, beginning with Sumerian cuneiform script, the oldest discovered form of coherent writing from the protoliterate period around 3,000 to 2,900 years BCE.[a] [1])
[21:48:30] <PapuaHardyNet> I mean, yeah, I know that
[21:48:40] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: would that still keep the overriding of popupability for annotation so popupable+annotation = annotation?

[21:49:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: (The other, technical, objection to your idea is that there's currently no facility for determining at load time whether an annotation for a link will provide a content popup for alink, so your "fourth state" is not something that the code can ever know about)
[21:49:31] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: So, like, "popupable+annotation" is just not a thing
[21:49:34] <PapuaHardyNet> I'm simply stating the fact that investments made in particle physics may be better spent somewhere else at this point, because it seems we are hitting diminishing returns from the amount of money thrown into theoretical physics

[22:31:19] <gwern> that'd be a maximum likelihood model. such theories would be pretty dumb. "god loves humans specifically, and not tentacle aliens" <-- there, just maximized your likelihood to 1

[22:32:25] <gwern> but it satisfies your exact criteria: 100% of the time the universe runs, god hates hentaliens and loves humans, and so creates only humans and never aliens
[22:32:43] <gwern> and you come across it naturally because god says in the bible he loves humans so much he'd sacrifice his only son for them
[22:32:44] <feep> right! it's a great theory on probabilistic and explanatory grounds 
[22:33:03] <feep> it's just so atrocious on message-length grounds that it loses anyway

[22:38:02] <gurkenglas> you use your telescopes and spectrometres and so on to arrive at a distribution over models, perhaps "1% matrix, 80% drake, 19% ???", where drake is a product of random factors as usual. now you update on "no aliens" and the problem so far was the posterior looked like "10% matrix, 1% drake, 89% ???" but the paper turns that into "3% matrix, 70% drake, 27% ???" so we're fine

[22:50:29] <gwern> there's a github issue I think
[22:50:35] <gwern> but no discussion of the internal dynamics
[22:51:08] <PapuaHardyNet> of course
[22:51:19] <gwern> basically, if that +1 had been there, we would've gotten biggan working in late 2020 on full danbooru with high quality 256px anime, then had the effort and enthusiasm to make the small tweaks for 512px to work, generated Ganbooru and launched with that. it would've been much more impressive than TADNE turned out to be
[22:51:37] <gwern> with the momentum we could've thrown in e621 and derpibooru since arfa et al already had them downloaded
[22:51:56] <gwern> and started bootstrapping with ganbooru to rank saples automatically and finetune models
[22:52:33] <gwern> tossing in additional tricks like top-k or data-augged D/G or evonorm would've boosted quality above the biggan paper
[22:52:48] <gwern> which had quality that was only recently surpassed by the diffusion models
[22:53:07] <gwern> with all of this on tap, eleutherai would've probably never formed, or would've failed

[22:53:49] <two2thehead> huh 'When the model is recast to represent realistic distributions of uncertainty, we find a substantial {\em ex ante} probability of there being no other intelligent life in our observable universe, and thus that there should be little surprise when we fail to detect any signs of it.

[22:53:49] <two2thehead> observable effects upon the universe.'
[22:54:00] <gwern> shawwn wouldn't've burned out like he did and turned on me or here, etc
[22:54:18] <PapuaHardyNet> yeah, I can see that. It is a tragic loss
[22:54:25] <gwern> ...yeah. that goddamn motherfucking +1
[22:54:48] <gurkenglas> gwern, on the bright side, this is evidence that if you had succeeded we would not have survived
[22:55:02] <gwern> madokai did nothing wrong!
[22:55:09] <PapuaHardyNet> on a more technical note, the original (paper described) implementation didn't have the +1, but you had to figure it out on your own, correct? (just checking)
[22:55:50] <gwern> PapuaHardyNet: we don't know because it was never released, so who knows how *exactly* its image processing code did the gamma. I dunno about the pytorch reimplementation mooch did release as the unofficial official implementation
[22:56:48] <gwern> I think it probably did do the +1 because the gamma had a learnable parameter (which is how the busted compare_gan version worked: the NN simply gradually increased that parameter by a total of 1 to cope with the absence)
[22:57:17] <gwern> and that was probably how shawwn found the issue. by the end, he was going through every single op and reverse-engineering the model weights of the released G to figure out what on earth was going wrong
[22:57:25] <RiversHaveWings> oh god i remember this
[22:57:44] <gwern> so I assume he eventually reached the gamma parameter and went 'this parameter is much larger than the parameter in the released G wtf'
[22:58:25] <gwern> 'why is it so large? you don't need to increase gamma that much, it should be a small number, just to tweak brightness a little. actually, how does this not lead to all-white images which are completely screwed up' [hours pass] 'no'
[22:59:14] <gwern> so, that is how a missing +1 led to a world with a lot more language models, and a lot fewer anime models

[23:01:20] <two2thehead> kuudes, s0ph1a feep : I did some yakshaving today. I think I made some progress :-)
[23:01:28] <RiversHaveWings> gurkenglas: maybe
[23:01:37] <gwern> RiversHaveWings:  yes. so, it manages to recover by backpropping through the not-quite-zero to make it more than not-quite-zero every iteration, and so when you look at the samples, they *look* reasonable. it's just that this... somehow screws with the regularization, or the batchnorm, or just fucks up the trajectory, or maybe just wastes so many iterations that the unstable GAN dynamics...
[23:01:43] <gwern> ...decay and diverge before you reach the best FID, or...
[23:01:49] <RiversHaveWings> *nods*
[23:02:05] <gwern> I dunno what the issue is, because by that point everyone had given up and burnt out (except for aydao still plugging away on TADNE)
[23:02:17] <gwern> and lots of people had left for eleutherai where at least the art bots were improving regularly

[23:03:06] <gwern> tensorfork hit a wall of +1s, and drowned
[23:03:24] <gwern> shawwn will tell you all sorts of other grievances, but that's the real underlying problem
[23:04:17] <two2thehead> gwern, I wish I knew what to say to make you feel better. This is obviously a high stress thing for you
[23:04:27] <gwern> it is absolutely infuriating
[23:04:31] <gwern> so much potential lost
[23:04:52] <gwern> I could see the whole trajectory forward once we had the Ganbooru model trained. that was the bottleneck. the model.
[23:04:53] <gurkenglas> what would you tell past you through a chronophone about it
[23:05:08] <gwern> nothing. it was the stupidest tiniest possible bug
[23:05:36] <gwern> there is nothing you could tell your past self to prevent such a subtle yet fatal bug in code that was simple and had no right to have any bugs whatsoever
[23:05:50] <gwern> you should never think "it's the image processing code"
[23:06:27] <gwern> use pytorch? tpu support was busted the entire time, it would've cost *so* much money to drive the tpus with the busted tpu support in pytorch
[23:06:59] <gwern> we just fell prey to incredibly shitty bad luck, the sort of horrendous thing that feels like divine malice

[23:08:36] <gwern> especially when setting to 1 is apparently convention anyway so you'd assume the gamma is already correct (why would it be zero)
[23:08:43] <gurkenglas> Missed everything after my last line. By chronophone I of course mean, you can only say advice that would still apply to the next similar thing
[23:09:05] <PapuaHardyNet> you only missed "00:06:25 <gwern> not even a bad +1 in the code, the *absence* of a +1. how you find that???" and I recommend getting a bouncer

[23:10:50] <gwern> if there was anything I could do about it, I'd at least feel a bit better about there being a learning lesson. but there isn't. all I can do is stew in my frustration and watch the opportunity cost pile up
[23:11:22] <gwern> once tensorfork fell apart, it can't be put back together. I can always apply for TRC tpus, but I can't bring back shawwn
[23:11:48] <gurkenglas> sounds like what you should do about it is update what counts as tiny, because "tiny" is supposed to mean "has no nontiny effects" :D
[23:11:51] <feep> two2thehead: yay, congrats
[23:12:36] <gwern> regrettably, that is what DL is like. tiny changes, huge results. that is why it is so hard to debug
[23:13:16] <gwern> did you frigging not implement SGD right? hey, the NN will still work! "NNs want to work". did you miss a +1 in low-level image code but it still *looks* like it works so you have no idea? "NO FID FOR YOU"
[23:13:51] <feep> I wonder how many stories like this the big teams have.
[23:14:55] <gwern> oh, loads
[23:14:56] <feep> I want to read about how like, alphago was training with an inverted leaf rating until three weeks before the lee sedol match or sth
[23:16:10] <PapuaHardyNet> I've updated towards being more optimistic about alignment. I've also updated towards being more interested in programming / research approaches that are robust to such problems (and I also now realize why you were so insistent on me logging as much metrics as possible and starting small when it comes to architectures).
[23:16:11] <gurkenglas> "we were accidentally training for negative elo. we have reached state of the art in losing to gurkenglas"
[23:16:16] <feep> haha
[23:16:23] <gwern> feep: hm, well, they obviously don't want to write it up, but some of it does leak out. for example, alphazero was partially invented by the bayesian optimization of the hyperparameters, did you know that? they noticed that as training went on, it kept trying to use fewer and fewer actual rollouts, instead just using the value estimate.
[23:16:41] <gwern> gurkenglas: the OA preference learning research did just that, btw. 'maximally nsfw' output
[23:16:46] <feep> gwern: haha
[23:17:04] <feep> gwern: "this part of your algorithm is pretty cool, clearly you put a lot of work into it"
[23:17:11] <feep> "but look: how about if you not"
[23:17:19] <gwern> feep: 'wait, we don't need to roll out estimates to the end, the value estimates are just that good? hm...'
[23:18:26] <gwern> PapuaHardyNet: regrettably, these things can only be experienced, and not conveyed. so people read me quoting karpathy's law or taking as axiomatic that small changes in NN source code could have large downstream capability gains, and they just don't believe me
[23:19:13] <gwern> from 50,000 feet, it all just looks smooth and reliable
[23:19:44] <gwern> and it doesn't help that academia falsifies the intellectual history of everything
[23:20:19] <gwern> thus all my rants about how DL is empirical and almost all of the theory is post hoc theorizing done to gussy up the results actually found by grad student descent and is intellectual fraud
