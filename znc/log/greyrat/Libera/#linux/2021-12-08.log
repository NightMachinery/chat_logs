[01:47:15] <PaulFertser> BlipBlop: fwiw I'm using wpa_supplicant without any kind of network manager. I use wpa_cli and can create new connections by "add_network" then "set_network <N> ssid "<itsssid>"", "set_network <N> psk "<psk>"" and then "enable_network <N>".
[01:47:48] <PaulFertser> BlipBlop: it's also possible to get "scan_results" with it. wpa_cli is scriptable from any language you like.
[01:48:39] <MrElendig> and then you have to deal with actually setting up the interface with ip, gw, broadcast, routing etc.
[01:48:42] <PaulFertser> BlipBlop: if you have no experience with D-Bus then probably running wpa_cli would be easier for the task.
[01:49:08] <MrElendig> imo better off calling nmcli than wpa_supplicant + whatever else random choice you make
[01:49:10] <PaulFertser> MrElendig: I'm using Debian wpa-roam config , so it runs dhclient etc automatically.
[01:49:25] <PaulFertser> nmcli would assume having networkmanager running and managing wifi.
[01:49:31] <uwharrie> that assumes they're even using network manager

[01:50:28] <PaulFertser> There's not much choice, it's either wpa_supplicant or iwd to handle connections to WPA/RSN networks.
[01:50:33] <MrElendig> so same problem
[01:50:49] <PaulFertser> And I'm talking about calling wpa_cli, not wpa_supplican itself.
[01:50:58] <uwharrie> if they're writing their own network management GUI, I'd say that's a safe assumption
[01:51:01] <MrElendig> there is exactly 0 difference there

[01:52:56] <PaulFertser> It's just a different frontend to control the same daemon, so it can probably work in parallel unless NM is aggressive at sticking to current SSID or something like that.

[02:19:31] *** Joins: mactron_ (~mactron@APN-123-252-22-gprs.simobil.net)
[02:19:33] <PaulFertser> MrElendig: I'm talking to people using plenty of different ISPs; most of those who provide native delegate at least /56 so one just passes an /64 out of it to the LAN, so SLAAC works nicely. Some stupid ISPs (somehow common in Japan) provide only /64 but then the end user usually runs an NDP+RA relay, so SLAAC works too.
[02:19:47] <BlipBlop> Is it possible for you to try out the example code of the Pywifi module real quick on your linux machine?
[02:20:02] <PaulFertser> BlipBlop: you're telling strange things. Why would you want to connect to an AP but not use it to pass any traffic?

[02:21:12] <BlipBlop> haha
[02:21:24] <PaulFertser> MrElendig: having less than /64 in residential service (if native IPv6 is provided at all) is exceptionally rare in my experience.
[02:21:31] <MrElendig> PaulFertser: less than 1/5 of the isps supports ipv6 at all :/
[02:21:57] <MrElendig> pretty damn sad
[02:22:04] <PaulFertser> BlipBlop: because associating to an AP doesn't necessarily mean you can pass traffic. That's what we're discussing and that's what MrElendig was warning you about.

[06:20:17] <Helenah> hmm
[06:20:34] <phogg> Helenah: That sounds like the sort of effect you can get (0) if you have a ridiculously huge number of files in the dir, (1) if the dir is on a mountpoint hanging on I/O wait.
[06:21:01] <Helenah> phogg, I have a ridiculously huge number of files.
[06:21:20] <phogg> Helenah: you can check on the first one using a program like https://termbin.com/nwun (if you have a compiler handy). Just pass the path to the dir to it.
[06:21:42] <phogg> Helenah: if that program returns fast then it's just time spent waiting on ls to read the whole dir and then sort it, stat()ing tons and tons of files
[06:21:43] <mdogg> Helenah: Did you add more RAM or is that just something somebody else suggested?
[06:22:05] <phogg> Helenah: there is a practical limit to how many files you can put in a dir, so if that's it then start mv'ing some to other dirs

[23:52:06] <SnowCode> Hello. I would like provide people with remote weechat using ssh+tmux+weechat. But I can't be sure of what all the users do
[23:52:20] <SnowCode> Should I create a chroot for that kind of things or do I have other alternative?

[23:53:03] <SnowCode> Is there any other way than chroot to do this?

[23:53:20] <mrfb> a linux container?
[23:53:21] <MrElendig> I would create some immutable image, with just the weechat homedir being saved as a mutable state
[23:53:49] <MrElendig> assuming you want to preserve state between runs
[23:54:02] <mrfb> lxc, maybe podman
[23:54:29] <kveroneau> Why not systemd's nspawn?
[23:54:46] * kveroneau thinks there are way too many options these days.
[23:54:49] <MrElendig> and don't run this on a machine that has other important data/tasks, use dedicated hardware/vm for it
[23:55:20] <mrfb> kveroneau: didn't know about that, cool
[23:55:20] <SnowCode> MrElendig:I can't run it on another machine than my main server :/
[23:55:27] <MrElendig> then don't do this

[23:56:07] <rouji> at least do it in a vm then
[23:56:12] <mrfb> SnowCode: virtual machine
[23:56:15] <MrElendig> you can do it in a vm on said server, but even that is a bit iffy
[23:56:20] <kveroneau> Yeah, systemd does just about everything these days.

[23:56:56] <kveroneau> And their machinectl command can even pull and push container images.
[23:56:57] <SnowCode> With a vm it won't it become huge? At the end of the day I just want a weechat running
[23:57:24] <MrElendig> won't be that much overhead
[23:57:40] <MrElendig> and I do assume that you care about security at all
[23:57:42] <mrfb> I'd go with lxc instead of a vm
[23:57:52] *** Quits: Guest5645 (~luca0N@nautilus.luca0n.com) (Ping timeout: 268 seconds)
[23:58:02] <SnowCode> yes at least lxc is smaller than a vm. I didn't think about that +1
[23:58:13] <kveroneau> LXC is pretty good, libvirt supports creating LXCs without the LXC userland tools being present.
[23:58:21] <MrElendig> you are after all giving random users full access to run arbitary code on your machine
[23:58:31] <kveroneau> libvirt makes LXC a bit more easier to manage in many respects.
[23:58:44] <SnowCode> Never heard about libvirt
[23:58:48] <mrfb> and it's easier to automate
[23:59:06] <kveroneau> And libvirt's LXC even supports executing a single program or script instead of the init-system of a container.
[23:59:21] <SnowCode> Is there some guides for this?
[23:59:22] <MrElendig> remeber, you are not just giving them access to run weechat, you are giving them rce
