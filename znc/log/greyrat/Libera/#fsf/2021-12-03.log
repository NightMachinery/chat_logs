[13:27:12] <avar> I'd like to submit a patch to GNU make, its page (https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) points me to savannah (https://savannah.gnu.org/projects/make/), where I'm logged in, but the "submit a patch" (and same for the drop-down) appears to have been disabled, it's <span class="disabled"> in the source.
[13:27:46] <avar> I see from "mailing list" that there's a "bug-make", which some people seem to attempt to submit patches to, would that be the right venue?

[20:43:18] <craigt> tfisgnag: Let me check on that.
[20:44:15] <tfisgnag> I am getting ready to contact membership@fsf.org and jeanne@fsf.org

[20:45:06] <craigt> tfisgnag: There was a little outage this morning, but everything should be up and running. What is currently not working for you?

[20:59:02] <tfisgnag> Yes. I remember because it was when this problem began. We had found that the new version had a new licence and author and you encouraged me to add it to the FSD entry and I couldn't because CAS didn't let me in.  After that I discovered CAS wouldn't let me in to the FSFAMF. Something it had never done before.

[21:01:11] <tfisgnag> I could now enter the FSD but not the FSFAMF
[21:01:54] <tfisgnag> I couldn't solve that problem by myself so I emaild jeanne and members@fsf.org.
[21:02:23] <tfisgnag> They solved the FSFAMF problem. I don't know how the FSD problem got solved.

[23:20:57] <panosalevro> FSD would require a different approach though, i think
[23:23:45] <craigt> panosalevro: agreed.
[23:25:24] <tfisgnag> craigt:  in my case they are the same. So I entered my CAS nick.. What next?
[23:26:36] <craigt> panosalevro: How did you revamp esp? Was there a test version where you could work on how it looks?

[23:30:31] <craigt> Thanks everybody for another great meeting! See you next week.
[23:31:33] * craigt will be around for while to wrap up conversations.
[23:32:38] <craigt> tfisgnag: Put that link in the License note field and save. I will double check the results.
[23:33:36] <tfisgnag> craigt: OK, I was needing that help. You need some rest. I will do that and if you don't mind we will talk about this next Friday.

[23:40:48] <craigt> panosalevro: Basing the FSD layout off of your ESP layout is probably a good approach.
[23:40:51] <tfisgnag> craigt: I hope I have done what you expected me to do. I must leave now. See you next week or someday after today if you need to tell me something.
[23:41:08] <craigt> tfisgnag: You were great. I hope you enjoyed the exercise.
[23:41:25] <tfisgnag> yes. Thank you.
[23:42:18] <panosalevro> craigt: it would be great if i could also discuss ideas with david. i havent talked to him, but i imagine he has a good understanding of FSD's structure

[23:44:05] <panosalevro> cool
[23:46:20] <craigt> panosalevro: I will clean up https://directory.fsf.org/wiki/Free_Software_Directory:Backlog_Admin_Group/Main_page so we can use it as the project's focal point for collecting ideas and goals.
