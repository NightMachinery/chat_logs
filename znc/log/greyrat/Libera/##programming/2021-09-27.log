[00:44:02] <mercenary> often interest is capitalized once a month or so, going through every day's balance, and adding it up to the total 'interest for this month'
[00:44:10] <diophantoz> however, any change on the account will also effect the accrued value
[00:44:51] <diophantoz> that makes sense
[00:45:18] <diophantoz> how would i keep track of that time in my app?
[00:45:25] <mercenary> fun edge case: transaction on the 28th, interest capitalized on the 30th, transaction is reversed out on the 2nd
[00:46:04] <diophantoz> this is for a school project so i don't think they expect us to implement a date system
[00:47:12] <diophantoz> i guess i would just call a method doing something like "addMonthlyInterest"
[00:47:15] <mercenary> end-of-month: accrue interest on daily balance, post a single 'interest' transaction
[00:48:26] <mercenary> (or two interest transactions, if you have to deal with negative balances)

[00:49:21] <mercenary> don't forget the 29th in a leap year
[00:49:27] <diophantoz> this is more proof of concept, so then they'd might have to wait +- about 15 days to see if it works

[00:52:19] <Donitz> I'm sure there is some kind of official time that banks count interests

[06:44:45] <[itchyjunk]> amigojapan, haven't done much. mawk helped me figure out a few things in java, but i still can't wrap my head around all of it yet
[06:44:56] <[itchyjunk]> "sprites" might be too advanced of a concept
[06:45:16] <[itchyjunk]> maybe some simpler mouse click based game
[06:45:37] <[itchyjunk]> oh i did manage to write my first asm thingy
[06:45:45] <[itchyjunk]> compare two numbers and return the smaller one
[06:45:48] <amigojapan> [itchyjunk]: but sprites is the minimum to make a game
[06:46:07] <[itchyjunk]> right, maybe i'll understand sprites soon but don't for now
[06:46:15] <[itchyjunk]> i can make click based game

[10:03:16] <iridium__> kmh_: is it better?
[10:05:56] <kmh_> i can't really say, as i don't have much personal experience to that regard, i run linux version mostly as/for desktops
[10:06:25] <kmh_> iridium__,  however OpenSuse uses now as a base the professional Suser Server
[10:06:50] <kmh_> so it might be well suited for running a server in terms of tools and security

[10:07:58] <iridium__> kmh_: i think the choice for me was between Fedora, CentOS and Debian.

[10:11:51] <kmh_> iridium__,  office use, games, anything needing to utilise hardware

[12:25:15] <pyzozord> as far as I understand kvm stands for "kernel vm" and is as close as you can get to native
[12:25:37] <flaknet99> windows hits the disk drive really heavily, maybe you can put that in ram if it's currently a file somewhere
[12:25:43] <pyzozord> kvm makes use of your procesor's hardware virtualization cabailities

[12:34:48] <pyzozord> but should make things like drag and drop and sharing clipboard easier
[12:34:52] <mrig> there is a slight slow down when running a debian VM with gnome, but not as much.

[15:34:17] <Guest6834> Also, how could a non-24-hours user be in contact with a 24-hours one? It is like these 2 systems are not compatible.
[15:34:21] <Guest6834> What do you think?
[15:34:50] <mawk> you can check away status with the /whois command

[15:40:39] <EtherNet> that would be selfish, being in chat isn't only for answering but reading as well. And people is connected 24hs to keep the buffer going on, scrolling, and having the complete conversation to read along the idle time during the day.
[15:41:13] <EtherNet> so you shoot a question and wait for an answer, not specifically from someone. Whoever available could answer if ever.
[15:42:24] <Guest6834> "one person is here to read, no to answer" sounds selfish :)

[15:46:07] <Lyn> who says it's "supposed"? this system is learnable, so you can adjust your expectations

[15:51:31] <piou> Guest6834: you can't effectively change IRC without first understanding who uses it, how and why. Trying to, for example, enforce "connected = active" would not make IRC more efficient. It would only make it less useful to many that use it at the moment, and maybe more useful to others (but they're probably on discord). That's not a net improvement, and I'd even argue that changing what makes IRC

[15:51:37] <piou> different would probably be at its detriment at this point: people that don't want what IRC has to offer generally just don't use IRC, there are lots of other alternatives
[15:51:41] <EtherNet> there are thousand reasons for someone to decide if he wants to participate actively or not

[15:57:19] <Guest6834> it would be better that there were 1 user active than 100 inactive
[15:57:54] <EtherNet> not all Catolics go to Church but still they're catolics. And of course they are not "useless". So again, depending the point of view is your answer.
[15:58:03] <piou> Guest6834: your definition of usefulness seems to be the expectation that you can hop in somewhere and get an answer in a matter of minutes to your questions, but that expectation sounds pretty egocentric

This is hugely important because focus is important to my job.

[17:22:44] <piou> Guest6834: answering a question is tricky. Generally if you take it upon yourself to answer a question then you're going to be seen as the main protagonist of the interaction and expected to answer follow up questions. People generally don't just answer "Hmm, I don't know, see this maybe" when they don't have time because they're then expected to answer much more and don't want to be seen as rude.

[17:28:10] <piou> Guest6834: the active users are more likely to answer, which doesn't mean their answer will be reliable, nor the best the user could get. It also doesn't mean anyone *will* answer. And it doesn't mean one of the inactive person isn't going to have a better answer later.

[18:08:57] <Joanna> You know what the worst thing is active ops who let trolls wreck channels
[18:09:13] <[itchyjunk]> Yup, irc channels are for people who talk about stuff they want. They are nice enough to ocassionally help out people.
[18:09:21] <[itchyjunk]> There are some "support" channels like #ubuntu.
[18:09:30] <Psybur> Guest6834, it didn't make anything more clear. A room with 100 muted users, who remain, is an interesting situation that I would want to find out more about
[18:09:33] <[itchyjunk]> But even those don't garuntee you any type of support.

[18:10:00] <[itchyjunk]> there are thousands of channels.
[18:10:03] <Guest6834> well, "questions" are meant to be like "talks", yes; it is the same idea

[18:10:16] <[itchyjunk]> ##programming isn't a support channel.

[18:15:50] <piou> Guest6834: it's not, because you keep talking about being "efficient" and dismissing the place of inactive people in a channel. A channel can be efficient to get an answer, but that's while considering only the interests of the person asking a question. You're dismissing all other values, and in particular the fact that being able to read what was said brings value to the reader even if he didn't

[18:19:56] <mrig> irc is a living entity, it cares not for what you want, but it does react to your nurture.
[18:20:01] <[itchyjunk]> Oh, i had a question about `this` in java. So my professor said `this` is optional and he prefers to leave them out other than few spacial cases.

[18:21:28] * EtherNet can't believe we're still debating about something innecesary.... again he thinks someone is trolling if can't understand people participate on a chat when they want to and idle as much as they want.
[18:21:33] <piou> Guest6834: "it works" by leading you to expectations that aren't in phase with what's actually lived in the real world?
[18:21:54] <Guest6834> or that*
[18:21:57] <bjs> [itchyjunk]: tbh what does "good practice" even mean?  I'm sure if you asked 10 different developers what is "good practice" you'd get 12 different answers
[18:22:13] <mrig> EtherNet: na not trolling, just the folly and foibles of youth I think.
[18:22:17] <[itchyjunk]> bjs, good practice means it will carry over to other languages if i move around
[18:22:29] <[itchyjunk]> and if someone from a different language comes to java, they can make sense of my code easier
[18:22:36] *** Quits: merijn (~merijn@83-160-49-249.ip.xs4all.nl) (Ping timeout: 245 seconds)
[18:22:46] <bjs> [itchyjunk]: well that's a terrible definition of good practice,  because often the way you want to write things in Java is certainly not the way you want to write them in other languages
[18:22:51] <Guest6834> not impossing!
[18:22:56] <bjs> because the languages are different and you write things differently
[18:22:58] <piou> Guest6834: you can compare IRC to real life rooms, but all that shows is that they're very different and can't be used for the same thing. The fact that I can't go on with my life while remaining in a conference room shows the limits of the comparison: you can do things with IRC channels that you cannot do with physical (not "real-life", physical) rooms
[18:23:13] <[itchyjunk]> well, what's a good practice in your definition then?
[18:23:25] <[itchyjunk]> explicit is considered good i think? not sure
[18:23:35] <Joanna> Guest6834: the problem with no registering is you canâ€™t keep a nick which makes you forever a stranger
[18:23:41] <piou> Guest6834: and limiting your view of IRC to real-life rooms is not comparing them, it's just restricting yourself to a world where you should disconnect whenever you go to the toilet because physical life is a pain
[18:23:57] <bjs> [itchyjunk]: for example, you may want to use "static" methods in Java and it might be "good practice" whatever that means,  but if you were writing Python then maybe it wouldn't be the way people do because Python lets you write things in a different way that Java doesn't
[18:24:00] <jelly> Guest6834, in practice, registering users to keep a nym, and using bouncers to keep a persistent connection, solve some long standing issues with the protocol
[18:24:25] <Psybur> [itchyjunk], I'd say using `this.` is a good practice when its not a local variable. Like referencing a class field in a constructor or method. I think making it very clear when a variable is not in local scope is a good idea
[18:24:28] <bjs> [itchyjunk]: I don't know, kind of my point is that if you ask different developers what it means you'll get different answers.  Maybe something like "what the average developer likes/would write in this language" or something

[18:25:14] <[itchyjunk]> i should aks non developers
[18:25:22] <bjs> [itchyjunk]: Java has some weird rules around "this" and I personally prefer languages that force you to be explicit (e.g. Python),  whereas someone who programs in Java all day might not even notice the difference because of habitualization
[18:25:44] <Guest6834> jelly: I don't trust (or not have the time to) so much on technology anyway :)
[18:25:47] <[itchyjunk]> oh does it have some weird rules?
[18:25:51] <[itchyjunk]> we barely started on it
[18:26:01] <[itchyjunk]> yeah, i'll definately use `this` till i get a feel for it.
[18:26:02] <bjs> [itchyjunk]: well for a start sometimes you can just not say `this.` and it still works the same :)

[18:28:27] <Guest6834> you joined when the topic was almost ended
[18:28:28] <[itchyjunk]> Me making a comment on it is not insisting on it.
[18:28:39] <[itchyjunk]> It's been going on for last 50 minutes.
[18:28:45] <[itchyjunk]> Different definition of "almost ended".
[18:29:06] <[itchyjunk]> So basically, i want "sprites" than can collide with each other.
[18:29:09] <Guest6834> Joanna: that is like comparing web sites owners vs viewers
[18:29:14] <[itchyjunk]> like 2 balls that can "bounce" off each other.
[18:29:18] <Guest6834> or readers
[18:29:21] <Psybur> Guest6834, are you an only child?
[18:29:40] <[itchyjunk]> Just curious how hard it is to do such a thing
[18:30:14] <Joanna> I donâ€™t see any indication that guest is even a programmer
[18:30:23] <Guest6834> a child that has lot of experience on IRC? I doubt it
[18:30:32] <Joanna> Or has any interest in programming
[18:30:34] <bjs> [itchyjunk]: "how hard" depends on your abilities,  and how precise you want the physics to be.
[18:30:43] <Guest6834> Joanna: you also joined late
[18:30:43] <piou> Joanna: being a programmer is not a requirement, neither is having any interest in programming
[18:30:48] <[itchyjunk]> low precision and i have no abilities
[18:30:50] <bjs> [itchyjunk]: you can put an imaginary box around each sprite and then if they touch make them bounce apart.
[18:31:01] <Joanna> Guest6834: what do you program?
[18:31:02] <Psybur> [itchyjunk], collision detection and basic 2d physics isnt too tough, it is time consuming though
[18:31:13] <[itchyjunk]> bjs, yes that would be good. whats the difficulty for a beginner programmer for this
[18:31:15] <piou> Joanna: it's not as if this channel was always talking programming
[18:31:22] <bjs> [itchyjunk]: have a go at making a little physics simulation, like a 2d ball pit or something
[18:31:23] <[itchyjunk]> oh no, time consuming sounds bad :s

[18:31:48] <Psybur> Guest6834, do you have any siblings?
[18:31:56] <[itchyjunk]> and if i waste time on something too hard, i'll be a bit screwed
[18:32:18] <Guest6834> Joanna: I wanted a private talk but *I am not registered* :)
[18:32:20] <bjs> [itchyjunk]: that's why I suggest the little physics thing, it's a much simpler/smaller problem and if you find it hard you can decide the bigger thing is too hard
[18:32:26] <bjs> and if you find it easy, you can try do it for the real thing
[18:32:43] <[itchyjunk]> oh the physics thing is simpler? @_@
[18:32:44] <Guest6834> Joanna: I just think you share my views somewhat; this is all (you must be latin)
[18:32:52] <[itchyjunk]> sounds good, i guess
[18:33:02] <[itchyjunk]> doesn't sound easy..
[18:33:03] <Joanna> Guest6834: too bad for you :) I donâ€™t want flash in the pan trolls pming me..
[18:33:05] <bjs> [itchyjunk]: sure why isn't it?  A little 2d box full of circles with random speeds/direction and they move around

[20:33:07] <Psybur> Im pretty sure intellij and eclipse break your code into an AST to allow things like refactoring and such. Im sure they can let you delete entire statements if you look into keybinds
[20:33:12] <Izem> if they don't have the functionality you want, you can extend them

[20:33:27] <pyzozord> and it's just one feature
[20:33:46] <Izem> for most language deleting statements is a double click
[20:33:55] <pyzozord> i'm talking motions for your cursor that don't jump "words", they jump "statements"
[20:34:05] <Izem> since there are ; delimited
[20:34:30] <pyzozord> except when there are for example two lines in one line
[20:34:52] <Izem> like foo; bar; ?

[20:35:48] <bjs> pyzozord: have you seen scratch?
[20:35:56] <pyzozord> nope
[20:36:46] <bjs> pyzozord: it's the first one that comes to mind, it's made for kids but the way you program is snapping AST nodes together (graphically, and of course since it's for kids that's not how it's described usually...)
[20:37:16] <Izem> is it the ast, or are they paths?
[20:37:26] <bjs> Izem: paths?
[20:37:33] <bjs> I'm not sure what you mean by that
[20:37:35] <GeDaMo> https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/editor/
[20:37:35] <Psybur> Thats why i like Scheme. Code navigation is very simple, since the language is very simple. There is a bit of upfront cost with parenthesis but I think its worth it.
[20:38:19] <pyzozord> no that's not it either
[20:38:27] <pyzozord> that kind of visual editors are interesting though
[20:38:30] <bjs> pyzozord: see GeDaMo's link,  there are lots of examples (but they fell out of my head) for this kind of thing for more standard engineering
[20:38:35] <InPhase> "a bit" of parentheses?  ;)
[20:39:05] <InPhase> (((((just) a (bit)))))

[20:39:12] <Izem> yeah that isn't quite an ast it makes sense
[20:39:35] <Izem> lisp has less parens than c++
[20:39:41] <bjs> Izem: what isn't quite an ast?
[20:39:52] <Psybur> InPhase, those parenthesis allow you to jump around and copy things and slurp and barf easily. Not so easy in Python. If I want to expand or contract something, i have to find more specific features
[20:40:19] <Izem> the connectors
[20:40:21] <bjs> pyzozord: sure I mean it's presented differently but is the same,  most "professional" engineers (who are the ones who make these kinds of tools) tend to prefer text and aren't so concerned with navigating the AST in most cases
[20:40:36] <bjs> Izem: why are they not the ast?
[20:41:39] <InPhase> Psybur: But it makes it very challenging to visually map what is being done in what portion of the code.
[20:41:55] <Izem> ok, I was wrong
[20:42:23] <Psybur> InPhase, there are ways to break up the code to be easier to follow, nesting things on one line in any language is usually not very readable
[20:42:44] <Izem> yeah some lisp contructs are terrible
[20:42:55] <pyzozord> bjs: not sure about anyone else, but I personally always want my editors to match my thinking process, which is "add variable" not "write letter l-e-t"
[20:42:57] <Izem> plus prefix notation
[20:43:29] <bjs> pyzozord: I think you're unlikely to see these more rigid representations of the AST (i.e. inability to produce syntactically-incorrect programs) outside of more domain-specific, and outside of education/targeted at beginners
[20:43:37] <Izem> I guess text creates the ast as well then
[20:45:04] <Izem> it should be possible to get a more high level editor, but that will end up pretty language specific
[20:45:06] <pyzozord> bjs: I'm not really interested in inability to produce syntactically-incorrect code. I'm more interested kind of mental jumps. Just want the editor match my thinking process, so there is less effort in translating my ideas into program
[20:45:09] <macaw> bjs: "most \"professional\" engineers [...] tend to prefer text and aren't so concerned with navigating the AST in most cases" -> I have a feeling it might be a "chicken or an egg" problem.
[20:45:35] <InPhase> Psybur: It's the custom of nesting itself being dominant which is a big part of the problem.  For example, in imperative languages it is regarded as bad form to excessively nest, because one loses clarity about what happens under what conditions and in what time.  Abstraction is required to obtain a digested understanding, and heavy nesting impedes this.
[20:45:39] <Psybur> prefix notation is an upfront cost but its easier to expand. (+ 1 2 3) vs 1+2+3. The prefix notation is all 1 sexp. Easy to copy and refactor. 1+2+3 is 5 expressions, and to copy it all youd need a sepcific feature like "Copy all numbers with arithmetic operations"
[20:46:04] <Izem> that is a trick
[20:46:18] <Izem> + 1 2 + 3
[20:46:23] <Izem> or something like that
[20:46:48] <pyzozord> + + 1 2 3 I think :P
[20:46:54] <Izem> oh
[20:47:14] <Psybur> What trick?
[20:47:22] <Izem> I could just as well do +(varargs)

[20:51:52] <Psybur> To treat f(42) as one logical unit, youd need to basically compile the program to see that f is a function and (42) are the arguments. In Lisp, its (f 42) and your editor can just use the parenthesis
[20:51:57] <Izem> that is 2 expression
[20:52:01] <Izem> exp op exp
[20:52:19] <bjs> Izem: and that whole thing is an expression itself,  expressions can be made of other expressions
[20:52:26] <oldlaptop> Izem: It's like the old trick question about "how many boxes are in this box" - the box itself counts
[20:52:36] <bjs> Izem: and in Python f(42) is the same, it's an expression made of two others (the "f" expression and the "42" expression)
[20:52:38] <Izem> oh ok
[20:52:45] <pyzozord> bjs: and one major thing: hjkl would navigate by default some defined ast objects instead of letters
[20:53:15] <Izem> in an ide, there's just other ways to navigate
[20:53:32] <oldlaptop> python's semantics for "callables" are a somewhat different issue

[20:53:44] <Izem> but, a language to operate on the ast, that does sound pretty hardcore
[20:54:03] <Izem> only language that you can sorta do that is like lisp

[20:55:00] <Izem> to make their multi-program single executable
[20:55:02] <pyzozord> you cannot opreate on compilers ast, but you can build your own ast and operate on that
[20:55:04] <sam4488> hi 
[20:55:18] <bjs> Izem: you really can't, an ast is a theoretical thing or maybe a data structure but all languages accept a representation.  Unless you meant *within* the language itself, you can have functions that do ast transformations
[20:55:25] <bjs> which again is a representation but much closer to the internals

[20:56:13] <Izem> ok
[20:56:57] <bjs> pyzozord: I'm not sure how well the concrete suggestion you put forward would work (i suspect not very). But I do thing there is a way to produce the kind of thing you talk about.  I'm not sure how useful it would really be.

[21:10:34] <beaky> just switch to forth and have the ast be part of a stack machine

[21:10:51] <pyzozord> sure
[21:11:01] <bjs> pyzozord: but what you're saying is you want vim verbs which operate on not-text ASTs but on e.g. a Python AST but not "too low" a level of the AST presumably
[21:11:04] <bjs> but at the pyzozord-level
[21:11:05] <pyzozord> they part of ast of english

[21:11:57] <pyzozord> bjs: I can see you are trying to get under my skin for no reason :P
[21:12:01] <bjs> pyzozord: but even this is not a very concrete idea,  but thankfully vim is very extendible and so you can try writing your own little set of verbs (or just some mappings) which work at the level you want for the specific language you want and see what concretely you need
[21:12:33] <beaky> nice i like vim too it is my favorite text editor (though i now exclusively use emacs now)
[21:12:39] <beaky> tho i want to try vscode someday

[21:12:45] <beaky> i heard it is the future of text editors
[21:12:52] <Psybur> beaky, why do you use emacs if you like vim more?
[21:13:00] <beaky> yes there is evil mode in emacs it is awesome i will never have to use actual vim anymore i can live my entire life only in emacs
[21:13:16] <Psybur> beaky, you can use neovim in vscode
[21:13:28] <beaky> i use emacs because it feels like its own universe whereas vim is only for text editing in emacs i can do irc browse the web do email read pdfs write my diary etc
[21:13:31] <bjs> pyzozord: it's just you often do this where you come and say things are badly designed or whatever and then you come up with your own idea that is obviously clearly better except of course the idea barely even exists, and at even the smallest press of "well what is your idea exactly?" you get very defensive with "oh clearly you're just trying to upset me"
[21:13:48] <Izem> Psybur: emulation or the neovim engine?
[21:13:58] * macaw eats popcorn
[21:14:15] <Psybur> Izem, not too familiar but I think its neovim embedded into vscode, not emulation
[21:14:22] <Izem> pretty cool
[21:14:34] <beaky> i like neovim but it feels too similar to vim
[21:14:35] <bjs> pyzozord: for example,  how should you navigate around expressions with your verbs? Expressions are almost always part of an "escape hatch" of these systems because they're far too dense

[21:25:30] <pikapika> what
[21:25:37] <pikapika> how do they combine bash and a binary executable in one file
[21:25:52] <Izem> quite literally
[21:26:00] <pikapika> wtf
[21:26:00] <Izem> the binary is a string

[21:26:36] <Izem> no clue, but that has taken my pc out from time to time lol
[21:26:36] <pikapika> so instead of an external file its like a bin_file="..." thing in bash?

[22:05:19] <mrig> It is as if thought is effecting the screen because you forget that it is there, that is not the text though, it is the combinations; Text is that really, combinations expressions.
[22:05:51] <mrig> if it is not written or displayed is it not still text?
[22:05:52] <bjs> I guess these are the more extreme examples,  my mind is focused very graphically here and I can't think of any serious text-based editors like that.  I guess the number of AST/"logic" nodes is far too high you'd need some kind of macro/snippet language to expand/search them to use just the keyboard
[22:06:44] <mrig> yes I think that the language can still be greatly improved.

[22:21:36] <macaw> bjs: You're probably right about the number of AST nodes and a search language. But it feels a bit weird that we're still modifying tree nodes by modifying the text describing it.
[22:22:21] <bjs> macaw: in the end we're always going to be modify some kind of representation of a thing that describes it,  the question is how closely does that representation match the thing we're describing

[22:30:09] <diophantoz> hi, having some issue with dynamic binding.
[22:31:15] <diophantoz> i have a method that takes an int type (bankaccount type) ... using dynamic binding i should be able to create varieties of the bankaccount

[22:32:23] <macaw> mrig: Well, you were right that to a non-musician it is hard to comprehend. :p
[22:32:23] <GeDaMo> diophantoz: which language?
[22:32:37] <diophantoz> method is something like BankAccount (int type) 
[22:32:39] <diophantoz> GeDaMo, java
[22:33:02] <GeDaMo> So you want a BankAccount factory?
[22:33:20] <diophantoz> i thought i could simply create different bank account classes and add them to the BankAccount method
[22:33:22] <GeDaMo> Isn't that the Java term?
[22:33:31] <diophantoz> BankAccount createAccount (int type) *
[22:33:37] <diophantoz> GeDaMo, yes a factory

[22:34:33] <diophantoz> hence i put in the method: "if (type ==1) return new BankAccountType1; if (type == 2) return new BankAccountType2; etc
[22:34:41] <GeDaMo> You'd need some kind of table mapping integers to classes
[22:35:06] <diophantoz> this doesn't work ... it refer to the "base class" BankAccount
[22:35:37] <GeDaMo> What does?
[22:35:55] <GeDaMo> You'd have to cast in the method calling the factory
[22:36:00] <diophantoz> when i call the method
[22:37:13] <diophantoz> must the classes also be in the structure of superclass and subclasses?
[22:37:23] <diophantoz> not sure what you mean by cast in the method
[22:37:30] <GeDaMo> Depends what you're trying to do with them, I guess
[22:37:42] <diophantoz> i have a menu that calls the method where you also send the int
[22:38:00] <mrig> macaw: I need to implement something using the idea and write it up, the concept is not that compacted, but why it would useful is perhaps not easy to see without an example.
[22:38:04] <GeDaMo> Your createAccount(int type) always returns a BankAccount even if the actual object is a subclass
[22:39:21] <mrig> sorry is not that complicated, spell correct failure :|
[22:40:14] <diophantoz> GeDaMo, right
[22:40:32] <mrig> macaw: I think this is a combo of both category and group theory though which is pretty out there apparently.
[22:40:33] <diophantoz> at the moment it only picks up the default BankAccount class
[22:41:04] <diophantoz> although i refer it to new instances of the other bank account classes: return new BankAccountTypeA();
[22:41:17] <macaw> mrig: I see. I'd love to see what you have in mind.
[22:41:46] <diophantoz> at the examples i have looked at I can't see much difference, and they do not use inheritance
