[02:33:26] <mikebutash> yeah, imho
[02:33:26] <demonicmaniac1> precision is a workstation, xps is crap
[02:33:44] <demonicmaniac1> if you want durabilty and replacement parts and such
[02:33:51] <mikebutash> precision is pretty much the same hardware as an xps, just with a xeon proc.
[02:33:57] <topcat001> I agree precision is very expensive, but Dell gives us a crazy corporate discount
[02:34:00] <demonicmaniac1> not the 5xxx precusions though, just the latitudes
[02:34:09] <demonicmaniac1> and 7xxx
[02:34:14] <topcat001> so effectively not bad for us
[02:34:15] <demonicmaniac1> 3xxx/5xxx are not good

[02:34:57] <demonicmaniac1> you can score an e14 or e15 with a 5500u/5700u without dgpu with corporate discounts for 500 bucks probably though
[02:34:58] <topcat001> sales/marketing gets xps 13/15 and us devs get Precisions
[02:34:59] <mikebutash> well, last time I bought my xps15 was 2017, so I'm sure shit's probably changed, so I'm down with being schooled.
[02:35:21] <demonicmaniac1> that gives you a good vega dgpu and good zen2 cpu beating the pants of anything intel
[02:35:26] <topcat001> we have gotten 60% off on bulk precision orders
[02:35:51] <topcat001> and service has been stellar too
[02:36:09] <demonicmaniac1> you can always get a latitude if you don't need a beefy dgpu too
[02:36:23] <demonicmaniac1> precision are just fatter gpus over the latitudes really

[08:08:29] <mpan> If you haven’t already entered a partial upgrade state, which strictly speaking is unsupported, I would suggest `checkupdates` to narrow down the list. But since it’s too late, you must find out which of those packages depend on vte3 manually.

[08:09:18] <mpan> vte3-git offers only a very specific version of vte3, as indicated by `provides`.

[08:10:27] <mpan> Because it may be needed in some extremely rare situations.
[08:10:59] <mpan> And the argument is invalid even if that was’t true. No one will be removing a flag just because you use it improperly.

[08:50:19] <Santzes> "Install the grub package" it does?
[08:50:36] <alloy> yeah it doesn't
[08:50:46] <Santzes> after that I used the "# grub-install --target=x86_64-efi --efi-directory=esp --bootloader-id=GRUB"
[08:50:51] <alloy> pacman is only mentioned once, not in that context
[08:50:56] <mpan> Yes, it does. Literally “Install the grub package.” Even with a link to what “install” means.
[08:51:39] <alloy> Installation
[08:51:39] <coruja> ah, down there
[08:51:40] <alloy> Install the grub package. (It will replace grub-legacyAUR if that is already installed.) Then do:
[08:51:40] <alloy> # grub-install --target=i386-pc /dev/sdX
[08:51:56] <alloy> wouldn't it be easier/more logical to just have the command there?

[08:53:32] <mpan> You are being linked to that information. It’s enough. And, anyway, the question never mentioned not understanding what “install” means or trouble with installing the package.
[08:54:11] <mpan> This is not a copy-paste guide. You are supposed to understand what you are doing. Which means: knowing the right commands to do that, where those commands are widely used.
[08:54:22] <alloy> up until now the install wiki has been using pacstrap to install

[08:55:57] <alloy> I know and respect that arch has a famously good wiki, but it's possible to end up going down a never ending wiki rabbit hole when things aren't too clear.... also sooo much stuff in wikis is out of date.
[08:56:17] <coruja> the word 'install' contains a link to how to install packages
[08:56:48] <alloy> "install a bootloader - for example command1 command2 is all you need to configure grub, the most common bootloader"
[08:57:35] <alloy> hey, I've been a Linux sysadmin for over 20 years so if I find it hard to follow :')
[08:58:13] <alloy> like telling someone the best way to learn linux is to read all the man pages - that's just horrible advice ;)
[08:58:13] <mpan> Anyway, solved now.
[08:58:21] *** Joins: synchris (~quassel@user/synchris)
[08:58:49] <mpan> And “install” in Arch context usually means `pacman -S packages`. `pacstrap` is also just a wrapper over `pacman -S` that makes things easier.
[09:01:11] <alloy> yeah, 100% not trying to be argumentative or rude, totally appreciate the work of the FOSS community.  Just suggesting it might be better to simplify the bootloader section of the install wiki... the rest was easy to follow.
[09:01:14] <Santzes> I can actually see the point as pacman hasn't been used in the guide yet
[09:02:00] <mpan> Santzes: there is a link. Literally the first word of that sentence is a link.
[09:02:06] <mpan> Anyway, it’s solved now.
[09:02:33] <bookworm> it assumes that you know the difference between say something like debootstrap and apt... Arch isn't exactly targeting people new to Linux
[09:03:08] <mpan> Unless you do not download and run random apps in your browser (aka JavaScript), that is something that is there to provide explanation for exactly that situation.
[09:04:21] <mpan> If they don’t, then I bow to them. If that was really a reason the term was unclear.

[09:06:43] <alloy> then I have two openstack clusters to build over the weekend....
[09:07:10] <mpan> The GRUB article is not really a part of the installation itself. It’s a documentation for GRUB. And, again, there is a link already that provides explanations.
[09:08:06] <alloy> yeah mpan I get what you're saying, but remember you're familiar with this already ;)
[09:08:18] *** Quits: jjt (~jjt@user/jjt) (Quit: Lost terminal)
[09:08:28] <mpan> What could be done, perhaps, is making a separate article about installing a boot loader for people, who use the installation guide. But that would basically duplicate the same article with just a different wording.
[09:09:32] <alloy> oh my point is that pretty much everyone uses grub, so a couple of lines at the end of install would work, then have the links for someone that might want to go a different way
[09:10:06] <mpan> My point is that you were pointed to it during the installation procedure, but that doesn’t have to be the case in general.
[09:10:32] <coruja> maybe it would be a good idea to place the 'install grub package' hint at the top of the grub wiki page as it's necessary for both kinds of systems

[09:12:26] <mpan> I would agree more explanations are needed, if it would be simply “Install the grub package”. But the “Install” word is a link that provides information on what it means to install. Which IMO should be sufficient.

[09:34:52] <mMal> Yesterday a strange issue started, Gdm is stuck in a login loop. I have to change what enviroment i login in to before login succeeds. From journal: Gdm: GdmDisplay: Session never registered, failing
[09:35:19] <mpan> alloy: anyway, have you solved the partition issue? I asked about whether `lsblk` lists “/boot” as being a mountpoint for anything.
[09:35:53] <alloy> mpan nope, only swap and /mnt are mounted
[09:36:44] <mpan> I can’t help with EFI much, as I am myself on BIOS systems, but I can at least verify some things and spot some common mistakes.

[09:37:21] *** Joins: nohtanoj (~jx@user/jonathon)
[09:37:32] <mpan> alloy: if it’s not mounted (but be sure it really is not!), then perhaps you have run something that operates on “/boot” before mounting it. That happens from time to time.
[09:38:16] <another|> this is assuming you want your ESP as /boot

[09:39:09] <alloy> I think I'll get a little NIC to play around with this more... use the gui installer for now so I can use my lappy.

[09:42:04] <mpan> Installing the linux package causes `mkinitcpio` to be invoked, which will blindly write to “/boot”. Probably from that.

[15:18:53] <Gagis> on a related note. I am using EFISTUB and a bit miffed with it. How large is the danger of breaking my system if I try to migrate it to booting grub instead of kernel image directly?
[15:19:05] <grawity> Gagis: very small tbh
[15:19:08] <rcf> Almost zero. 
[15:19:14] <MacGyver> Gagis: "Breaking" in what sense.
[15:19:32] <grawity> install grub first, it should work as usual, and if it works then just remove the efistub-based boot entry
[15:19:35] <MacGyver> Gagis: You won't (usually) brick the system, at most you'll just have to boot into the install ISO and fix the boot loader manually.
[15:19:39] <Gagis> in the sense of needing to spend a couple of hours repairing an unbootable system
[15:19:53] <grawity> nah worst case is needing to spend 15 minutes
[15:19:56] <gabbiel> grawity: the menu, but its not really a "menu", because grub is used, its the way it makes it look, the font is so disgusting, just for that reason alone I dont want to use efi bootin
[15:20:07] <grawity> gabbiel: yeah, pretty sure you can skip the EFI boot menu
[15:20:23] <Gagis> that option should be in your uefi bios settings
[15:20:23] <grawity> gabbiel: I mean millions of systems boot Windows and Linux (indeed even GRUB) via EFI, but without displaying any EFI menus
[15:20:41] <grawity> gabbiel: in fact I'm not entirely sure why it shows up on your system
[15:20:58] <Gagis> yeah, normally it needs to be manually enabled to be shown at all
[15:21:17] <grawity> gabbiel: normally it only shows up if a) you hit the "boot menu" key, or b) all its usual boot options failed or something

[15:22:41] <grawity> is the issue that the text is all kind of stretched?
[15:22:51] <rcf> gabbiel: if you think grub just looks ugly at the default EFI resolution, you can configure that. 
[15:22:55] <gabbiel> the issue is the way efi booting makes the grub menu and initial loading fonts look 
[15:23:04] <grawity> and how old is your motherboard
[15:23:21] <grawity> older (as in ~10 year old) EFI systems indeed had poor support for higher resolutions
[15:23:21] <jkc> gabbiel: And does that issue solve itself by the time the system is actually booted and ready for use?
[15:23:25] <gabbiel> yes the text is stretched

[15:23:55] <gabbiel> yeah by the time the os is up all is good
[15:23:59] <grawity> e.g. my 16:9 laptop used to boot at 1024x768 ... though it did that in all modes, not EFI-specific, it's just that EFI font was more terminus-like than the usual IBM font
[15:24:03] *** Joins: xoan3 (~xoan@user/xoan)
[15:24:12] <grawity> on *newer* EFI systems, grub can actually be told to use a higher resolution

[15:24:38] <jkc> If the ugly font problem resolves itself by the time the system is in a state to actually be used, then who cares?
[15:24:53] <grawity> nah, ugly is ugly
[15:24:53] <Gagis> MacGyver, I wrote a script to make updating entries easier but I'm still a bit worried about what happens if I end up with a broken kernel or faulty boot options and need to boot via USB to fix it. Would be nice to use grubs boot option editor on the fly
[15:25:04] <grawity> but I'd much rather fix the ugly in a better way than switching all the way to BIOS/CSM mode
[15:25:05] <gabbiel> I care, I want it to look good
[15:25:12] <Gagis> and have more space for fallback kernel. putting two images into the efi partition is getting crowded
[15:25:27] <jkc> grawity: Nah, this is whiny nitpicking.
[15:25:30] <MacGyver> Gagis: You may want to consider systemd-boot instead.
[15:25:40] <MacGyver> Gagis: Features you want without the complexity of grub.
[15:25:41] <Gagis> good point, I certainly might
[15:25:47] <gabbiel> also, how do I even propagate grub settings, my system doesn't even have the update-grub executable for some reason

[15:30:05] <MacGyver> Though you may need to alter the output path -- I don't know what filesystem layout the install scripts use for EFI.
[15:30:35] <MacGyver> So check first whether grub.cfg is already at the location that's telling you to write to.
[15:30:37] <MacGyver> Then overwrite.
[15:31:56] <Gagis> hm, I think my /boot mount is the actual efi partition. might have to remove that mount point and create an actual /boot directory when migrating? well, can't be too hard

[15:33:26] <MacGyver> Gagis: No, you don't need to.
[15:33:34] <MacGyver> Gagis: Utilizing the ESP as /boot is perfectly fine.

[15:33:45] *** diep_ is now known as diep
[15:33:53] <Gagis> well, as long as I dont add more kernel imagine than it has space
[15:33:55] <Gagis> yeah
[15:34:09] <MacGyver> If you're seriously considering splitting it, skip systemd-boot.
[15:34:32] <MacGyver> At the moment handling separate /boot is a bit... iffy.
[15:34:50] <MacGyver> The loader entries need to be on the same partition as the kernel images, iirc.
[15:35:09] <MacGyver> And it needs to be able to read it using UEFI FS drivers so it'd still have to be FAT32 usually.
[15:35:22] <MacGyver> Unless that's been worked around / fixed by now.
[15:35:36] <Gagis> well thats fine then. will just have to think what to do about fallback images. started getting low space on partition warnings after a recent kernel update with how large the -fallback.img got

[15:39:06] <grawity> though
[15:39:18] <grawity> that depends on what filesystem you use for /, you might still need a separate /boot in some cases

[15:40:31] <MacGyver> That's the one thing it still has going for it, support for the kernel and initramfs in any place it can access with its own modules.

[16:42:26] <varighet> for me it needs to be 2c, 4c, 8c, 16c or 32c
[16:42:32] <varighet> 6, 12, etc just feels wrong
[16:42:39] <Gagis> yeah, IIRC their cheaper processors tend to be chips that fail QA for the expensive one but pass with some disabled cores
[16:42:46] <jelle> 20 cores!
[16:42:50] <varighet> lol
[16:42:59] <MacGyver> 14 was the sweet spot of price/functionality for me.
[16:43:03] <jelle> who cares as long as it is > 4
[16:43:10] <MacGyver> Allows me to give 10 cores to the VM and keep 4 for the host.
[16:43:19] <jelle> :o
[16:43:25] <jelle> MacGyver: vm running windows?
[16:43:27] <MacGyver> (Yes. It's overkill. Sue me.)
[16:43:29] <MacGyver> jelle: Yeah.
[16:44:06] <MacGyver> I'd been running on a 6c/12t and giving 5 cores to the VM, and it was clearly struggling in games, so I decided to upgrade to something that'd last me at least 6 years.
[16:44:09] <MacGyver> Hopefully more like 10.

[16:44:44] <SysGhost> heh... with the progress I suspect it won't last more than 3 years. 4 tops
[16:44:52] <MacGyver> Why?
[16:45:09] <MacGyver> If anything, CPU advancement has slowed down a *lot* in the past decade.
[16:45:17] <SysGhost> GPU race gonna require a whole lot more from the CPU side.
[16:45:48] <MacGyver> I doubt I'll have a problem with that.
[16:45:54] <MacGyver> I've never run the latest-and-greatest GPU.
[16:45:58] <SysGhost> Maybe... but.. I'm not so sure it'll slow down. Now that Intel and AMD is on par with each other it'll go nuts.
[16:47:33] <SysGhost> We'll see though. I might be wrong

[20:25:52] <brejela> Nistar: You can always check protondb to see if a specific game you're looking to play is compatible.
[20:25:59] <farchord> XD
[20:26:03] <HEX0> also if you did buy a game license you can technically obtain without drm :P
[20:26:14] <Nistar> Will do :-)

[20:30:07] <SmarmyWalrus> So I have a weird gaming question. I've been getting into vitetris (multiplatform, but been playing in the arch vm recently) and it accepts both keyboard and traditional /dev/input/js0 input. However, I noticed when I move my mouse it breaks the game; tiles moving around, etc. So I investigated whether or not my /dev/input/js0 was actually active. Sure enough, my mouse input does correspond to changes on /dev/input/js0. Does anyone 
[20:30:07] <SmarmyWalrus> know a way to disable this behavior? Terminals tested include Kitty, Alacritty, and Foot. Running sway-wm. Am in a VirtualBox VM in case that could matter here.

[20:30:42] <HEX0> usually a default wine prefix without wine tricks seems to works for me. Though I guess proton and dxvk might give better performance in some cases, but those old games run well enough to not bother

[22:09:50] <susi> then a proper rule in i3's config to float and center window with [title="batterymon_notice"], of course
[22:11:47] <MacGyver> Right, this works like I want now, including screenlocking.
[22:12:13] <MacGyver> (Probably because of delay.sh in /usr/lib/systemd/system-sleep, but eh)
[22:12:31] <MacGyver> (Otherwise the screen locker kicks in *after* resuming from suspend.

[22:13:31] <susi> I don't need delay.sh luckily, would feel so dirty..
[22:13:50] <MacGyver> See the reason I even was still using acpid for this was because the firmware on this laptop was so broken, that *closing* the lid would *resume* from suspend.
[22:14:06] <MacGyver> So I had an acpid-script that would wait for 5s after lid-close before suspending.
[22:14:08] <susi> MacGyver: could you add an inhibitor with "delay" mode?
[22:14:25] <MacGyver> Possibly.
[22:14:31] <susi> I have such for xss-lock

[22:16:57] <MacGyver> The problem is actually fixing it s.t. it delays until the locker has started.

[23:27:57] <kailo> Namarrgon, this is my desktop that i'm working on, has a i5-2500k, 16gb ddr3, and a radeon 6450 with 1gb vram.  The chromebook I'm comparing it to has a celeron cpu with integrated gfx and only 4gb shared ram

[23:28:26] <Namarrgon> oh, i misread your initial question, okay
