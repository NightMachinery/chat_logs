[02:12:02] <spiderman> php fucking sucks
[02:12:27] <mistiry> why?
[02:14:08] <spiderman> extension/module support sucks, your stack is limited because you either have to embed FPM into your webserver process or use fcgi which is old as dogshit, upgrading from minor version to minor version can be catastrophic and there is no easy way to do that in-place without downtime, and....
[02:14:18] <spiderman> uh
[02:14:21] <spiderman> there is other stuff I'm sure
[02:14:45] <spiderman> Oh, and FUCK composer (dependency manager). It always blows up for some reason in the middle of an important deployment
[02:16:00] <mistiry> meh, never really had much to complain about in terms of modules and extension support. needing something like FPM is a problem other server-side languages also has, thats not unique to PHP and honestly, is rarely if ever an issue i face. upgrades, sure, but thats why you test (and hopefully have good devs that dont constantly do dumb shit like use deprecated functions from 4 versions ago)
[02:16:03] <spiderman> never wrote PHP though, so I can't speak about that

[02:24:55] <ExCeL> I'm thinking about trying to pivot into an ISSM/ISSO dual role. I know what's needed, but I'm an FSO managing defense stuff so I guess my main question is whether it would be worth doing
[02:25:13] <ExCeL> With both workloads
[02:26:06] <mistiry> oof, thats above my experience. FSO as it Foreign Service Officer?
[02:26:11] <mistiry> as in*
[02:26:29] <ExCeL> I work with State but not that type of FSO. FSO as in Facility Security Officer
[02:26:42] <mistiry> only person here i know that might know the gov stuff is Hunterkll/@Hunterkll
[02:26:50] <mistiry> but im sure there are others
[02:27:01] <mistiry> dual roles in general i personally shy away from
[02:27:15] <mistiry> can be good learning experience, but can also burn you out
[02:27:20] <mistiry> maybe its different in gov
[02:28:35] <ExCeL> Yeah problem is a lot of companies are requiring a lot of FSO's to do two roles as the ISSM/ISSO because of new requirements. It's something I know I can do, it's just something I'm not sure I want to do at this point

[02:36:16] <ExCeL> Yeah it's a little niche given the situation because obviously not all are in a position to be able to accomplish both so I guess that's why I'm kinda wondering about any ISSM's/ISSO's to help clue me in on their workload for that type of role.

[10:51:05] <Cl0udNinja> Sir Sceptalot but you're not getting paid for that overage being counted 'backwards' as you put it. you're just discounting your overall bill by paying debt via electricity.

[22:43:02] <Activ8> it's theraputic to some people
[22:44:38] <JollyRgrs> tbh, i thought rgb keyboards were kinda stupid... but i actually really like mine. color coding it for certain games/apps is kind of nice to easily find a key when my fingers aren't currently on the keyboard
[22:45:05] <JollyRgrs> like for rocket league, i'm on a controller, but i can easily find F8 to make a clip or T/Y/U for chat prompts b/c they are the only things lit up
[22:45:15] <shibboleth> something tells me that you'd find a significant overlap (venn diagram) between "those people" and people who spend hours trying out windows themes/skins
[22:45:29] <JollyRgrs> i'm sure
[22:45:54] <JollyRgrs> for normal stuff, all my letters are one color, other chars another, number row diff color, F keys diff color
[22:46:14] <JollyRgrs> again, just kinda makes it easier to find things if i don't have my fingers sitting at the homerow already
[22:46:36] <JollyRgrs> or like, i've got home/end diff color than ins/del and pgup/pgdn
[22:51:10] <shibboleth> so... an over-engineered version of the colorful keyboards of the late 80s?
[22:51:35] <shibboleth> and we've somehow regressed in terms of power efficiency? :P

[23:00:16] <shibboleth> well, whatever floats ones boat. i'm likely biased
[23:00:23] <JollyRgrs> likely
[23:00:31] <JollyRgrs> a blind person wouldn't see any benefit in this at all
[23:00:39] <JollyRgrs> others, their mileage may vary
[23:00:51] <shibboleth> "fond" memories of LAN-parties where ppl were bragging that this neon-sign/keyboard make them better at CS
[23:01:05] <JollyRgrs> yeah... i have no such memories of that
[23:01:22] <shibboleth> nvm the fact that it were *wireless* kbs in some cases with the inexorable added latency
[23:01:32] <shibboleth> it/some
[23:01:33] <JollyRgrs> i had a keyboard that was backlit and i could change the hue of it... but never once thought it changed my abilities. if you are looking at your keyboard while gaming, you're already dead
