[06:45:21] <sheetjs> specific to warcraft 3, the classic (not reforged afaict) wc3 chose a very strange spreadsheet format "SLK", introduced by microsoft in multiplan
[06:45:24] *** Quits: bambanxx (~bambanx@181-163-42-132.baf.movistar.cl) (Quit: My MacBook Air has gone to sleep. ZZZzzz…)
[06:45:57] <sheetjs> its strange because it's not really well documented and because there were better choices in 2002
[06:46:25] <wroathe> It's always spreadsheets with you :P
[06:46:44] <sheetjs> the whole saga is super exciting and made for an actual business case to revisit the game
[06:47:00] <sheetjs> also found out the old discs are useless
[06:47:15] <wroathe> Yup. Reforged completely nuked the old game
[06:47:21] <sheetjs> OSX catalina ditched HFS support, so you can't even mount the game discs
[06:47:29] <wroathe> Fans are rightly mad about that and any number of other problems they introduced.
[06:47:43] <sheetjs> the classic client is still available for download
[06:47:51] <wroathe> sheetjs: They used to let you download the installer on the blizzard website
[06:47:55] <sheetjs> you still can
[06:48:02] <wroathe> sheetjs: But ever since Reforged it's all now managed through battle.net
[06:48:25] <sheetjs> you can install and play the single player campaign using the old method
[06:48:29] <wroathe> sheetjs: Sure, but the original standalone installer won't work anymore. It's now managed through battle.net
[06:48:41] <wroathe> sheetjs: Oh? Maybe so.
[06:48:50] <wroathe> sheetjs: I had seen reports that that was broken now
[06:48:52] <sheetjs> there was a post on one of the forums with an actual link
[06:49:32] <wroathe> Honestly when they announced Reforged I felt like I was 16 again. Couldn't contain my excitement. The amount of betrayal I and others feel over this is hard to put into words.
[06:49:34] <sheetjs> https://www.blizzard.com/en-us/download/ if you scroll down you'll see "Reign of Chaos" and "The Frozen Throne"
[06:49:53] <wroathe> Yup. Looks like they're still there.
[06:50:06] <sheetjs> guess youwondering how they'll butcher D2
[06:50:21] <wroathe> I wasn't ever a Diablo fan

[06:50:57] <sheetjs> that's the state of all software

[06:51:32] <wroathe> cis: The magic that allowed an organization like Blizzard to flourish in the beginning is the stuff of legends that I don't think we'll ever see again
[06:51:46] <wroathe> cis: A game company more concerned with getting it done right than getting it done fast, and doing it for the passion of it
[06:52:18] <sheetjs> there's money in re-releases
[06:52:41] <cis> I doubt we'll see it from blizzard again, but there will be other companies and other creators that catch that magic spark.
[06:52:46] <sheetjs> link's awakening is $60 and nintendo managed to sell more units on switch than they ever did on gameboy
[06:53:13] <sheetjs> there are some very exciting games you should try out, all indies
[06:53:33] <sheetjs> hollow knight for a challenging metroidvania
[06:53:51] <sheetjs> dead cells for a rogue like (no wroathe not just because it has cells in the name :P)
[06:53:53] <wroathe> Honestly my bandwidth for gaming is nonexistant. WC3 just held such a special place for me that I had to get involved again.
[06:54:08] <cis> sheetjs: HK was great - I'm glad they're coming out with a sequel relatively soon
[06:54:31] <wroathe> I had a bad WoW addiction back in the day, and so I'm careful to avoid overcommitting to gaming agian.
[06:54:45] <sheetjs> silksong really should have been a rolling DLC

[06:55:16] <cis> they did have a bunch of DLC I think... I played it after it had all been released
[06:55:24] <sheetjs> gods and nightmares yeah
[06:55:39] <sheetjs> wroathe: have you tried hades?
[06:55:51] <wroathe> sheetjs: No
[06:56:14] <sheetjs> that's closer to diablo, but is an excellent game
[06:56:21] <wroathe> sheetjs: Looks cool.
[06:56:26] <sheetjs> RTS feels like a dying category
[06:56:36] <wroathe> Indeed. It's unfortunate.
[06:56:45] <wroathe> RTS, done right, is a beautiful thing.
[06:56:57] <wroathe> People just get turned off because of power gamers that ruin it for everyone else.
[06:57:51] <sheetjs> power gamers exist in LoL and overwatch but it never feels like they ruin the game
[06:58:17] <sheetjs> i personally think with LoL you kinda know exactly where you messed up and how
[06:58:22] <GreenJello> depends on how you implement matchmaking
[06:58:28] <wroathe>  Yeah, in RTS the difference is night and day. A beginner can't even hope to get lucky and beat an experienced player in 1v1.
[06:58:29] <sheetjs> with an RTS you can't really attribute a loss to a specific action you did
[06:58:43] *** Joins: gggp__ (~gggp@114.245.111.117)
[06:59:22] <sheetjs> clash of clans is not an RTS but it's a lot closer to what a beginner-friendly game would look like
[06:59:25] <wroathe> And there are particularly humiliating ways of defeat that cause people to just leave the game. For example, a raider rush in WC3 is enough to make anyone flip their table.
[07:00:09] <wroathe> The beginner is off creeping somewhere on the map, and an experienced Orc player can just come in and destroy half of the buldings of that beginner before they even have a chance to return to their base and defend themselves
[07:02:40] <sheetjs> how would you implement "rubber banding"?

[07:05:11] <neshpion> speed *= place :^^^^)
[07:05:48] <sheetjs> oh that was in the context of RTS
[07:06:20] <sheetjs> mario kart does it by giving progressively better items to the players at the back of the pack
[07:06:41] <cis> the dreaded blue shell
[07:06:45] <sheetjs> MK8's super bell
[07:06:47] <neshpion> the trick is to get in last, get a star or something, then fight your way to the front the hard way and save your good item
[07:06:57] *** Joins: onosendi (~onosendi@user/onosendi)
[07:07:15] <sheetjs> gotta admit, making the super bell only available to second and third place is pretty clever design
[07:07:37] <sheetjs> cis: super bell is the counter to the blue shell
[07:08:16] <neshpion> they should do class-based items where 1st-3rd place get tons of items that negatively impact everyone else
[07:08:26] <cis> sheetjs: last MK I played was a long time ago... didn't have the bell
[07:08:52] <sheetjs> yeah its a new addition precisely because the blue shell had no natural strategy other than sandbagging
[07:09:19] <sheetjs> haha neshpion its the other way around, the blooper obstructs the screen for players ahead of you
[07:10:16] <sheetjs> anyway the point wrt
[07:10:26] <onosendi> JWT
[07:10:28] <sheetjs> most RTS games dont have that effect
[07:10:36] <onosendi> How do you get the bot to send you the JWT article?
[07:10:49] <sheetjs> it plays like chess, where a material disadvantage can quickly snowball
[07:10:52] <neshpion> !JWT
[07:10:54] <neshpion> maybe
[07:10:57] <neshpion> nope
[07:11:01] <onosendi> JWT!
[07:11:20] <GreenJello> !jwt
[07:11:20] <jellobot> GreenJello, Don't use JWT for sessions. http://cryto.net/~joepie91/blog/2016/06/13/stop-using-jwt-for-sessions -- JWT was never meant to be used for sessions, and its popularity happened purely because of marketing: https://youtu.be/GrLtOjCTB1s?t=1h2m44s  |  Instead, use session cookies: https://gist.github.com/joepie91/cf5fd6481a31477b12dc33af453f9a1d
[07:11:38] <neshpion> what are JWT actually for?
[07:11:40] <wroathe> sheetjs: Well, to some degree RTSes are self-limiting. There's a supply limit
[07:11:45] <onosendi> There it is, thanks.
[07:11:50] <wroathe> sheetjs: And in WC3 there's something called "Upkeep"
[07:12:06] <wroathe> sheetjs: The idea behind that it costs additional money to keep a large army supplied

[07:12:46] <wroathe> sheetjs: So they tax 3 out of every 10 gold you mine if you've got a 50 food army, which means that your opponent who has a smaller army is out mining you
[07:12:49] <cis> neshpion: the video recommends using them as single-use tokens for things like authorized downloads
[07:13:22] <wroathe> sheetjs: And if you've got an 80 food army they tax 6 out of every 10 gold you mine
[07:13:57] <cis> neshpion: to be fair though, auth systems like Auth0, Cognito, and others use JWTs
[07:15:04] <wroathe> That message is kind of misleading. JWT is just a format.
[07:15:05] <ljharb> neshpion: nothing useful
[07:15:07] <sheetjs> that only penalizes you for a large standing army
[07:15:08] <wroathe> You can encode a JWT in a cookie
[07:15:22] <ljharb> right but you can also just put a session token in a cookie
[07:15:39] <sheetjs> do you pay a recurring cost for additional town centers or w/e?
[07:15:45] <wroathe> sheetjs: Yup. The point is that if you don't make a move with that large standing army you risk giving your opponent a chance to catch up

[07:16:11] <wroathe> sheetjs: That large standing army tax applies to all of your additional expansions
[07:16:26] <wroathe> sheetjs: And if you've got a small army you might have trouble defending all of your expansions
[07:16:26] <sheetjs> i kid you not ljharb, it was completely unexpected
[07:16:34] <sheetjs> the slk file format actually supports comments
[07:16:54] <sheetjs> and the only time i've seen it in the wild is in a few files that ship with WC3
[07:17:27] <sheetjs> none of the books mention it, the wiki page doesn't talk about it, none of the open source libraries support the files
[07:17:36] <sheetjs> even libreoffice choked on a few of em
[07:18:38] <sheetjs> no part of the story makes sense, especially "why would blizzard use slk in the first place?"
[07:18:39] <wroathe> sheetjs: And expansions aren't free in WC3. There's an up front cost in both time and money.
[07:19:02] <banana_> alright guys less WC3 and more W3C
[07:19:07] <wroathe> sheetjs: So trying to expand in that way makes you vulnerable to what's called a "timing attack" from a player who chooses not to pay that up front cost

[09:12:04] <sheetjs> people bash EA for killing franchises
[09:12:07] <systemfault> And all the people that made Blizzard what it is left the company...
[09:12:22] <ljharb> yeah that was in 2013
[09:12:26] <sheetjs> but if the franchises were successful, why would the owners sell to EA in the first place
[09:12:29] <ljharb> blizzard had lots of problems long before that

[09:13:16] <ljharb> but sure, that was a big downhill point
[09:13:41] <sheetjs> starcraft 2 wasn't a bad game
[09:14:15] <ljharb> brood war was great
[09:14:23] <ljharb> but online play stopped being fun once everyone figured out how to rush
[09:14:31] <wroathe> systemfault: Warcraft 3 is probably my favorite game of all time.

[23:13:38] <sillyslux__> "extract the default to a separate function"? did you mean separate object?

[23:15:31] <GreenJello> that would work if you're assuming it won't be mutated
[23:16:07] <sillyslux__> you really meant to say separate function then?

[23:36:23] <sheetjs> in jsdoc is a colon permitted after a name?
[23:36:41] <sheetjs> in specific, `@arg {number} foo: bar` is acceptable
[23:37:07] <sheetjs> but the optional `@arg {number} [foo]: bar` for some reason vscode marks the colon in red
[23:38:07] <GreenJello> what does that syntax mean?
[23:38:22] <GreenJello> the []s
[23:38:31] <sheetjs> https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/jsdoc-supported-types.html#param-and-returns
[23:38:41] <sheetjs> optional param
[23:38:55] <GreenJello> ah
[23:39:07] <sheetjs> curiously, closure-style optional params don't have a default?
[23:39:22] <sheetjs> or maybe it does support it and is just missing from the docs
