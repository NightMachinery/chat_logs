[02:08:12] <chrisb> how do you like gnus for rss using nnrss backend?  i've been using it for a few weeks now

[02:18:32] <jao> i use rss2email and then read the emails in gnus or notmuch, so i can easily search.  i find it more flexible, and totally asynchronous is a big plus.
[02:39:46] <chrisb> jao: yes, my nnrss Groups slow down startup
[02:41:34] <chrisb> do you have sophisticated expire settings for those rss2email groups, or do they just pile up?
[02:46:15] <jao> in gnus, they go to a group with expiry target set to delete and expiry wait of a few days.  in notmuch, they got distinctly tagged, and i have notmuch scripts that expire articles based on their age.
[02:47:41] <jao> it's very easy to do because rss2email let's you control to which mailbox the feed messages go, or set the "to" address per feed (so i use, for instance, jao+scheme@localhost, for feeds that go to my scheme group), and then one can split incoming mail on that.
[02:47:49] <jao> *lets
[04:16:30] <chrisb> very good
