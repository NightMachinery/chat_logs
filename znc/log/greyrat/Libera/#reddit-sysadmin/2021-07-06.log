[06:18:55] <sd> 08<c​ritamine> I feel like the only way to get that is to be an epic liar in the resume/interview and hop into a Jr Dev Position

[06:30:49] <Work-BWMerlin> For those that have removed authenticated users from pre-windows 2000 compatible access have you had any issues?
[06:31:07] <estranger> Drupal microservices 🤔
[06:32:10] <KingCobraJFS> just databases, bunch of caching, maybe an API or two, and maybe some SOLR work.

[09:15:16] <xe0n> okay then just ask away :)
[09:15:18] <d1> I'd just like to interject for a moment. What you’re referring to as Linux, is in fact, GNU/Linux, or as I’ve recently taken to calling it, GNU plus Linux. Linux is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning GNU system made useful by the GNU corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX. Many 
[09:15:18] <d1> computer use version of the GNU system every day, without ...
[09:15:18] <d1> ... realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of GNU which is widely used today is often called “Linux”, and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the GNU system, developed by the GNU Project. There really is a Linux, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the system they use. Linux is the kernel: the program allocates the machine’s resources to 
[09:15:18] <d1> the other programs that you run. The kernel is an ...
[09:15:18] <d1> ... essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself it can only function in the context of a complete operating system. Linux is normally used in combination with the GNU operating system: the whole system is basically GNU with Linux added, or GNU//Linux. All the so-called “Linux” distributions are really distributions of GNU/Linux.

[09:33:57] <Luelinker> Adagio, I'm just not sure if I should be specifying subnets which already exist on my network, or configuring Wireguard to utilize its own subnet and route traffic elsewhere.

[09:37:43] <A-KO> bravo
[09:38:39] <Adagio> Luelinker: On the server, give the interface an RFC 1918 subnet (like 10.0.1.0/24) and its peer a /32 within that subnet. On the client, give the interface the /32 you named for the server's peer. Client's peer's allowed IPs are 0/0 (to force all traffic to the VPS).

[10:47:21] *** Joins: seednode (~seednode@user/seednode)
[10:47:53] <jay-ros> similar to "I bet people will appreciate my stick figure family bumper sticker!"

[10:48:24] <enix> dont forget the "fuck your stick figure family" guys 
[10:48:33] <enix> with stick figures killing stick figure families
[10:48:54] <enix> because having a stick-figure family themed anti-stick figure family sticker is totally different
[10:49:09] <jay-ros> just bumper stickers in general?
[10:49:19] <enix> idk i can't judge
[10:49:25] <enix> we used them for group identification
[10:49:28] <jay-ros> I like the stickers on the sides of those cars that go really fast around the race tracks
[10:49:44] <jay-ros> yeah, that's also a valid reason, identification in a useful form
[10:49:49] <xe0n> racing strips
[10:49:54] <enix> Yeah.. not like we knew all the people in our groups
[10:49:56] <jay-ros> no that's a type of haircut
[10:50:11] <enix> racing stripes are ehhh
[10:50:18] <enix> i remember people tried to get edgy with them and put them to the side
[10:50:22] <jay-ros> I've tried it, the girls didn't really comment

[10:53:17] <enix> you were on the right path from the get go
[10:55:11] <DrZak> The technological and cultural stagnation of the middle ages (or in case of africa the past 3000 years) meant that old people had almost nothing to complain about.
[10:55:13] <jay-ros> 'wanna come for a ride in my hachi roku?"
[10:55:15] <jay-ros> "ok..."
[10:55:23] <jay-ros> "cool, it's a fast old corolla!"

[10:55:51] <nobyk> did the redbull guy dieded?
[10:55:56] <nobyk> who had like 3
[10:55:58] <jay-ros> I've watched "need for sixty seconds"
[10:55:59] <enix> you know those hurley shirts with hurley writen in the middle of a circle?
[10:56:11] <DrZak> that thing is fairly ugly, not as bad a lada
[10:56:14] <enix> I had one of those but HR in the middle of the circle. Was my primary shirt
[10:56:14] <DrZak> but pretty bad
[10:56:20] <enix> suuuper into that car. I miss her :(
[10:56:57] <DrZak> the new 86 seems pretty awesome
[10:56:58] <DrZak> get that
[10:56:59] <DrZak> :D
[10:57:07] <DrZak> i would, sadly, its too small for me :(
[10:57:21] <DrZak> as in, i hit the ceiling with my head
[10:57:29] <enix> It's more of a sports car than the AE
[10:57:47] <enix> AE was a great dual purpose thing. Someone imagined a RWD hatch back and came up with it so it was literal perfrection
[10:58:18] <enix> HUGE boot space, simple mechanicals, great front/rear leg room, ash tray was in this perfect pocket of dead air in the center of the car
[10:58:25] <DrZak> hmm true, there arent rwd hatchbacks around
[10:58:37] <enix> you could smoke a cigarette with your hand resting on the gear stick and it would ash perfectly into the tray from start to finish
[10:58:48] <DrZak> :)))))
[10:58:52] <enix> You could lay the rear seats down and it was big enough to be a bed
[10:58:57] <enix> mmmmmm
[10:59:04] <enix> new car doesn't hold a candle sadly
[10:59:23] <enix> you know that initial D thing where he puts the cut of water or whatever in a cup holder?
[10:59:29] <enix> and is like "dont come back if you spill it"
[10:59:36] <enix> absolutely possible in a well tuned ae86
[10:59:47] <enix> Maybe not at those speeds but absolutely possible to get it to spin
[11:00:09] <enix> Once you get it spinning it's less likely to slosh and wont go over the sides. tested that shit out 
[11:00:17] <DrZak> hahaha
[11:00:18] <DrZak> nice
[11:02:14] <jay-ros> anyone know how to make a windows notification popup thing in powershell?

[11:04:20] <A-KO> and also breaking 200K :D
[11:04:21] <DrZak> technically 'show-notification blaah' is also one line
[11:04:22] <DrZak> :D
[11:04:32] <nobyk> you guys think there'll be a 'company windows store' on windows 11?
[11:04:38] <enix> how you do while True: in PS
[11:04:38] <A-KO> I'll worry about applying to Microsoft later on in the week

[11:04:47] <A-KO> enix: while ($true) { }
[11:04:48] <A-KO> ?
[11:04:49] <DrZak> there's one in win 10 too
[11:04:56] <DrZak> so i imagine in win 11 it will be as well
[11:04:58] <nobyk> yeah but it suks
[11:05:01] <A-KO> while ($true) { do-thing ; start-sleep 1 }
[11:05:09] <DrZak> its corporate, its supposed to
[11:05:15] <nobyk> I read the one in win11 its a frontend for WinGet
[11:05:18] <A-KO> it's not
[11:05:39] <A-KO> the new store is a new store. The big changes being it's far more open, and can be used to ship out Win32 apps--not requiring their UWP nonsense to make store apps.
[11:05:41] <DrZak> till it is out, we are just guessing
[11:05:41] <nobyk> Not even partly?
[11:05:43] <enix> thanks -ako im trying to recreate dialup now
[11:06:07] <A-KO> That said, I would like to see an integration of the SCCM Software Center into the Windows Store--and maybe they'll make that happen with this one
[11:06:08] <A-KO> who knows
[11:06:09] <A-KO> maybe not
[11:06:11] <A-KO> but maybe
[11:06:30] <A-KO> the old store had a ton of limitations. No doubt I expect they're working on tons of backend changes to it
[11:06:35] <nobyk> lol I hope not, not here

[12:46:31] <yuken> Oliber, usually yes. Pure plastic can handle a few shots, and such designs do exist.
[12:46:58] <yuken> Oliber, in the US, the general point of the 3D printed stuff r/n is to print the regulated parts, and everything else is "factory made". But there are also designs that are fully homemade (with metal barrels/etc).

[13:42:58] <Luelinker> Dylan, try enabling the features using DISM.
[13:47:49] <xe0n> when you imported the iso into mdt, did you tell it to grab the entire iso or just the source.wim
[13:48:14] <xe0n> chances are when you made the usb it only copied the install.wim fine, and i believe .net and iis use the winsxs folder from the iso to install those features

[13:56:44] <xe0n> if you want to install FOD you'd do it through a task sequence
[13:57:11] <xe0n> its because i doubt your usb has the winsxs folder from the iso
[13:57:25] <xe0n> you can confirm this - in your deployment share, go to operating systems\whatever\sources
[13:57:28] <xe0n> and see if there's a winsxs folder
[13:57:46] <xe0n> if there is, that's where it works from the VM, and when you created the usb media, it only copied the .wim file from the task sequence
[13:58:21] <xe0n> and you can confirm that too if you take a look at the usb contents

[18:37:57] <haljhon> the pre-built cables we were required to use came in like 25ft, 35ft, 50ft, and 75ft... really made it a pain to manage.

[23:02:34] <AnonymooseReddtr> is it in a cluster?

[23:03:00] <SleePy> Nope. plenty of storage.  1tb+ free on all volums

[23:03:10] <PeterNorman> is disk i/o moving?
[23:03:25] <PeterNorman> or is it showing infinite disk queue?
[23:03:29] <SleePy> Can't tell.

[23:05:45] <SleePy> Yea
[23:05:52] <SleePy> Looks like the other host is bringing them back online.
[23:06:04] <AnonymooseReddtr> so you killed hung host and other host picked them up?
[23:06:16] <SleePy> We have had problems with this host.  Its motherboard failed.  Replaced it.  Updated the firmware on it today and now VMs are stuck after we put VMs on it
[23:06:20] <AnonymooseReddtr> sounds like you lost quorum and it didn't know what to do

[23:08:50] <sintax> why osx?

[23:11:15] <oxipital> nah i just want an os x machine. 
[23:11:25] <oxipital> cheapest way to it i figure
[23:12:09] <SleePy> Well some additional tech data showed that the host was zombie processes.  It didn't want to kill services, it was saying stopping and refused even with taskkill to stop processes.
[23:12:22] <SleePy> Windows is annoying that taskkill doesn't work like linux "kill -9"

[23:12:48] <SleePy> Yea,  We tried to bounce that service
[23:12:53] <AnonymooseReddtr> just my guess? your cluster lost quorum
[23:13:29] <SleePy> It seems like that.  But when I could see nodes, it showed all the nodes had 1 vote assigned to it
[23:13:38] <SleePy> ANd had a current vote of 1
[23:13:44] <AnonymooseReddtr> do you have a FSW?
[23:13:48] <AnonymooseReddtr> and how many nodes?
[23:14:16] <SleePy> FSW?
[23:14:21] <SleePy> Just 2 with a disk witness node
[23:14:32] <AnonymooseReddtr> file share witness
[23:14:47] <AnonymooseReddtr> is the disk witness something outside your cluster?
[23:14:51] <AnonymooseReddtr> or is it hosted in the cluster?
[23:15:12] <SleePy> csv
[23:15:25] <AnonymooseReddtr> just a guess
[23:15:37] <AnonymooseReddtr> Something network related that caused the cluster to lose quorum 
[23:16:05] <SleePy> Yea thats what it feels like
[23:17:02] <SleePy> The cluster indicated the witness disk as online.  ALl cluster resources indicated online
