[00:50:24] <Masklin_Gurder> rawtaz: I don't know how to clarify it
[00:50:39] <Masklin_Gurder> Do processes within a docker image show up as 'root' or not, if run as the image's root user?
[00:51:45] <BtbN> unless you're running rootless dockerd, root in the container is actual root
[00:51:48] <rawtaz> Masklin_Gurder: if you have a docker image in which there's a process started as root, then yes, that process will show as running as root on the host as well
[00:53:50] <Masklin_Gurder> rawtaz: Even if this 'root' user isn't actually the machine's root user?
[00:54:06] <BtbN> Then you're running rootless dockerd?
[00:54:16] <BtbN> Otherwise, root is full on root, with all its powers.
[00:54:35] <rawtaz> Masklin_Gurder: what does that mean? root is root
[00:54:43] <rawtaz> oh, "isn't" :D
[00:54:58] <rawtaz> Masklin_Gurder: of course not. a process running as a non-root user will not show as running as root :)
[00:55:21] <Masklin_Gurder> Uhm
[00:55:27] <BtbN> That wasn't the question?
[00:55:29] <rawtaz> Masklin_Gurder: so what do you mean, what is your "root" user that you suggest is "non-root" at the same time?
[00:55:38] <Masklin_Gurder> I'm imagining two root users here, one actual, and one that is contained within the image. Is this wrong?
[00:55:46] <BtbN> There is only one root user
[00:55:52] <BtbN> with the noted exception of rootless dockerd
[00:56:04] <BtbN> which emulates a root user, but with fewer permissions, so it explodes sometimes
[00:56:05] <rawtaz> Masklin_Gurder: please specify the second "root" user you have. how did you create it, and what is it that makes it root?
[00:56:12] <Masklin_Gurder> But the users who are running Docker do not have sudo access to this server, yet they're running things as root???
[00:56:27] <BtbN> Masklin_Gurder, users who have dockerd access are effectively root
[00:56:34] <BtbN> it's equivalent to giving them passwordless sudo rights
[00:56:44] <Masklin_Gurder> rawtaz: I've no idea, I'm not the one that is running Docker, someone else is, someone else who does not have the root password, but somehow still is running as root.
[00:56:48] *** Quits: bkhl (~bkhl@user/bkhl) (Remote host closed the connection)
[00:56:53] <Masklin_Gurder> BtbN: Seriously?
[00:56:55] <BtbN> Yes
[00:56:56] <Masklin_Gurder> God...
[00:57:19] <BtbN> It's documented like this, and warned about multiple times. Do not give untrusted users dockerd access. It makes them root.
[00:57:21] <rawtaz> Masklin_Gurder: ok. but waht are you seeing?? please simply be more concrete - show us exactly waht youre seeing or talking about so that instead of theoretical stuff we talk about the actual thing youre having a problem with
[00:57:36] <BtbN> rawtaz, seems pretty clear to me, what are you going on about?
[00:57:52] <Masklin_Gurder> The problem is that I'm worried about regular users having access to root even though they don't have a root password, but now I know why.
[00:58:03] <rawtaz> BtbN: theyre saying that a non-root user is running as root. thats pretty unclear to me what they are actually seeing.
[00:58:08] <Masklin_Gurder> I added the user to the 'docker' user group, and I suppose that's equivalent to giving them passwordless sudo?
[00:58:14] <BtbN> Masklin_Gurder, indeed it is, yes
[00:58:22] <Masklin_Gurder> Well that's awful, innit
[00:58:31] <rawtaz> Masklin_Gurder: assuming that your docker daemon/engine runs as root, yes. otherwise no
[00:58:35] <BtbN> It's how docker works, and why you shouldn't give random users dockerd access.
[00:58:49] <Masklin_Gurder> But then Docker could only be used by sysadmins?
[00:58:55] <Masklin_Gurder> A bit of a small audience
[00:58:55] <BtbN> Indeed, yes
[00:59:06] <BtbN> If you want to give untrusted users access to docker, give them a VM
[00:59:32] <DoofusCanadensis> mind you, docker should be geared towards individual developers... i.e. running on their own machine where they likely have root access anyway
[00:59:33] <rawtaz> Masklin_Gurder: non-sysadmin users shouldnt have docker admin privs. if you do need something like that you can e.g. write scripts that do just one single thing and let them run that, or specify specific sudo command privs that can only do exactly what they need
[00:59:42] <BtbN> You might be interested in rootless dockerd, which exists to tackle that whole issue, but it comes with a bunch of limitations and not all images work in it.
[01:00:05] <DoofusCanadensis> use a container orchestrator to run those containers on a shared server
[01:00:14] <rawtaz> Masklin_Gurder: i still suggest that you be more specific about what you are actually seeing and potentially having a problem with.
[01:00:20] <BtbN> Like, it can't bind on privileged ports, or do some lower level stuff root normally can do and some image might expect
[01:00:23] <rawtaz> then you can get more relevant analyses
[01:01:12] <Masklin_Gurder> rawtaz: I observe that 'root' is running bioinformatics programs. That should not happen, as none of the sudo users are running any bioinformatics programs. A student without sudo is running docker because she needed it for one of her projects and I gave her membership in the 'docker' group and that is the whole story.
[01:02:16] <BtbN> Masklin_Gurder, it's also trivial to escape dockerd. Like, you can just mount /usr/bin as volume into a container, and set suid root in /bin/bash, and then you got a root shell.
[01:02:37] <DoofusCanadensis> yeah, docker on shared systems doesn't seem wise
[01:02:54] <Masklin_Gurder> Alright so
[01:03:09] <rawtaz> Masklin_Gurder: ok, gotcha. to me that sounds like she's just running a container which happens to run a docker image which runs the software as root (instead of properly running as non-root inside the container, thats a problem with the Dockerfile in question). it doesnt have to mean he/she hacked the system and that there's a crisis that way.
[01:03:14] <Masklin_Gurder> I'll try to make it work with sudoless docker, and if that doesn't work I'll suggest to her some other container approach

[01:03:57] <BtbN> On our Cluster Environment, we provide singularity for our users instead of docker. It's designed for shared systems like that, and can (mostly) work with Docker-Images.
[01:04:10] <rawtaz> BtbN: if you are just inside a container, running as non-root, without access to the docker socket or similar, how would you do that though? you cant just say "hey, i want /usr/bin mounted into this container im in"
[01:04:23] <BtbN> rawtaz, you're still entirely missing the point.
[01:04:30] <rawtaz> BtbN: then enlighten me instead of being annoyed..
[01:04:33] <Masklin_Gurder> rawtaz: No I trust her to not intentionally hack or destroy anything, but as a matter of principle something needs to change.
[01:04:35] <Masklin_Gurder> BtbN: Thnk you!
[01:04:45] <BtbN> It's been explained like 5 times now, no idea how else to explain it.
[01:05:15] <BtbN> Masklin_Gurder, if this is in any kind of scientific environment, you probably want singularity.
[01:05:32] <rawtaz> BtbN: i was specifically asking about your "it's trivial to escape dockerd". im questioning how trivial it is to do that if you are an attacker that is just inside a container and running as a non-privileged user. or is that not the scenario you meant?
[01:05:41] <rawtaz> BtbN: you dont have to treat me like an idiot.
[01:05:44] <Masklin_Gurder> It is and thank you again, I'll look into that. Appreciate y'alls' help. :-] Good night!
[01:05:50] <BtbN> rawtaz, the "attacker" is a random user you gave dockerd access
[01:06:11] <BtbN> Giving them dockerd access makes them root on the host, exactly that described way.
[01:07:12] <rawtaz> BtbN: right, okay. i thought we were way past the point where we had all concluded that this is the case, and that you were talking about escaping out from inside a running container. i agree and of course what you said about giving a user dockerd access is futile, thats well established
[01:07:25] <rawtaz> im glad you didnt mean the scenario i thought you did :D
[01:08:00] <BtbN> It's usually also possible to escape to the host from inside a docker container when root, so don't trust that as a secure isolation either.
[01:08:23] <rawtaz> Masklin_Gurder: is it just one container she needs to run or several unknown ones she comes up with herself?
[01:08:27] <akik> BtbN: do you know of a container escape ?
[01:08:55] <rawtaz> BtbN: in that last thing you said, do you have an example? it's always interesting to understand these things better.
[01:08:56] <BtbN> akik, not of any trivial ones, but you have the power to load modules into the kernel, soo
[01:09:12] <rawtaz> hmm right. kernel module loading could be dangerous :-)
[01:09:22] <akik> BtbN: i use userns-remap
[01:09:38] <rawtaz> i dont know my capabilities off the top of my head, but i'd hope that having no caps would help mitigate that
[01:09:46] <BtbN> Then dockerd is not running as root, and you don't have the whole issue to begin with.
[01:09:52] <BtbN> root in the container is a fake-root then

[01:42:50] <rawtaz> im feeling a certain pain trying to inject configuration into my docker compose apps. its fine and doable using e.g. environment in the compose file and also in init scripts inside containers that are written to make ue of environment. but e.g. being able to configure/inject settings in postgresql.conf cleanly, not sure how to do that..
[01:43:18] <rawtaz> obviously something needs to write to that config file unless postgres can somehow read from the env instead, which i dont think (for these types of settings).
[01:43:42] <rawtaz> how does k8s and similar deal with this? does the ConfigSet or whatever its called let you control things like this with manifests? how does it work?
[01:46:02] <BtbN> You usually write some massive entry point script for the container, that translates env-vars into config files
[01:46:45] <rawtaz> actually there is one way i didnt think of.. one can use -c argument to the postgres command to specify individual options. so theres an injection point i can use in e.g. the compose file.
[01:47:00] <rawtaz> BtbN: yeah, i think thats it, what you wrote i mean.
[01:47:11] <rawtaz> still curious how it's done with k8s though :)
[01:47:25] <BtbN> pretty much the same way just 200 times more complex, because it's Kubernetes
[01:47:39] <rawtaz> hehe yeah
[01:47:49] <rawtaz> at least 200 lines of manifest per config setting :-)

[19:22:45] <vext01_> oh, that sounds like the sort of thing I don't want CI jobs to have...
[19:23:55] <vext01_> the thing is, PT doesn't require root, if /proc/sys/kernel/perf_event_paranoid is -1
[19:23:59] <tabakhase> there was a thing that starts as shim from a full --privileged and "tells you what was used after" - cant seem to find the name/link tho...
[19:24:18] <vext01_> i can use PT on the host as a normal user just fine
[19:24:34] <vext01_> but inside the container, i can't, even if i set /proc/sys/kernel/perf_event_paranoid to -1 inside the container

[19:47:21] <programmerq> vext01_▸ you can probably do a test where you fire up a container with --privileged and see if you stop getting the permission denied error. Then narrow it down to a specific capability-- it may not be cap_sys_admin. --privileged tosses everything back in and should confirm that it is indeed a capability type issue. https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/capabilities.7.html
[19:47:43] <programmerq> https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/perf_event_open.2.html - this says you need either CAP_SYS_ADMIN *or* CAP_PERFMON
[19:47:53] <programmerq> the latter may be acceptable in a CICD system, depending on your threat model.
[19:49:13] <programmerq> although, that same thing says cap_sys_admin, cap_perfmon, or perf_event_paranoid of less than one.
[19:49:20] <programmerq> I'm curious now.

[19:54:15] <vext01_> you can try my test suite? https://github.com/softdevteam/hwtracer
[19:54:23] <vext01_> just install rust and run `cargo test`
[19:55:07] <vext01_> (remember to set /proc/sys/kernel/perf_event_paranoid to -1 if you want to do stuff non-root)
[19:56:06] <programmerq> does my processor need a specific feature flag? I've got a homelab machine that's running an older proc.
[19:56:42] <vext01_> it needs to have intel pt support
[19:56:52] <vext01_> in /proc/cpuinfo you need `intel_pt` flag
[19:58:54] <programmerq> I probably won't be able to get into it then-- I'd have to fire up a cloud server somewhere to get that feature flag.
[19:59:13] <programmerq> my newer system is amd, and my intel system doesn't have the flag.

[21:16:44] <rawtaz> modsecurity is a plugin to nginx right?
[21:17:45] <rawtaz> i would 1) take the nginx docker image from hub.docker.com and if it's possible to "enable" that module in there do that otherwise extend that with my own Dockerfile which adds modsecurity. 2) grab the elasticsearch docker image from hub.docker.com. 3) use these in a docker-compose.yaml file and use docker-compose to make them work together.
[21:18:15] <ikke> it was originally for apache
[21:18:35] <rawtaz> yeah. but i think they ported it to nginx?
[21:18:54] <rawtaz> the one for apache is named mod_security unless i misremember :P
[21:18:56] <ikke> https://github.com/SpiderLabs/ModSecurity/wiki/Reference-Manual-%28v2.x%29#installation-for-nginx says it needs to be compiled in

[21:20:50] <rawtaz> then put that and elasticsearch in a docker-compose
[21:21:02] <rawtaz> i would guess theres examples of that or close to that online if you just duck or google
[21:21:45] <rawtaz> (FYI: OWASP is good stuff)
[21:22:42] <dmj`> tabakhase: my ops guy says, "You should have access to mount volumes since you're making your own containers" and "When you're running the job the VM it's running on is not the same VM as the runner itself"
[21:24:09] <gproto23> rawtaz: https://hub.docker.com/r/fufuhu/docker-nginx-modsecurity i pulled this and runned on ubuntu but it is not up when i enter my host.
[21:24:53] <gproto23> should i do run any other command in docker?
[21:25:01] <rawtaz> gproto23: why would you use that instead of the owasp one i linked to?
[21:26:54] <tabakhase> dmj` what coud also help, show your job, (just to confirm were on the same boat when talking about dind and such) -> use the CI/CD->Editor->ViewMergedYaml 
[21:28:12] <gproto23> that one does include nginx?
[21:28:56] <rawtaz> gproto23: if you were to take a few seconds and read 1) what i write to you and 2) what it says on the site, you will see that both of these places explicitly mentions that this image comes in two versions, one based on nginx and one based on apache. so, "yes".

[21:35:14] <rawtaz> gproto23: the docker image contains nginx and modsecurity yes
[21:35:24] <rawtaz> so thats what you need, at least based on what you asked initially
[21:36:15] <rawtaz> i woud recommend that you refer to the image by this tag (at least for production use):  3.0.6-alpine

[21:36:41] <MikeBux> gproto23, i am newbie to docker, too.

[21:37:51] <rawtaz> so all in all, owasp/modsecurity:3.0.6-alpine and elasticsearch:7.16.3
[21:38:01] <rawtaz> make a docker-compose with those
[21:38:06] <MikeBux> still need to learn basics and find it difficult
[21:38:11] <gproto23> rawtaz: i am just trying to clarify: imo it has two options - nginx and apache. it means is coming with nginx? if no, should i build nginx in apart?
[21:38:18] <rawtaz> then you can up and down them. but you can of course use them manually if you really want. compose is great though
[21:38:43] <rawtaz> gproto23: depending on which of the tags you reference the image with, it gets you the nginx OR the apache version. so if you use the tag i mentioned it will be the nginx version
[21:39:14] <rawtaz> it comes with nginx and modsecurity, no need to modify that. please read the usage instructions for info on how to configure nginx in it if you need to do that more

[21:52:51] <rawtaz> thats what docker-compose makes so superbly simple to do
[21:53:20] <rawtaz> so you can just up and down them all together, and it also keeps track of dependencies, and instead of having to specify a bunch of args you have it all just configured in one single file instead.
[21:53:30] <ikke> rawtaz: in what sense are they different?
[21:55:17] *** Joins: rvalue (~rvalue@user/rvalue)
[21:56:18] <rawtaz> theres some commands that behave differently, i dont remember exactly what but i think its that the `docker compose` one doesn't have all arguments that the other one does? i'd describe it as that one not being feature complete in comparison with the docker-compose one.
[21:56:45] <rawtaz> every time i tried to use it i was missing something or it didnt work as i needed it to, and there was someone else in here a while ago who had the same problem
[21:57:03] <rawtaz> surely it is usable in most ways and covers most of the things you need from it, it's just that it's not "complete"
[21:57:20] <rawtaz> so i just keep using docker-compose and hope they dont deprecate that :>
[21:58:16] <gproto23> yes i had the same problem

[23:11:12] <programmerq> it looks like nvcr.io/nvidia/l4t-tensorflow:r32.6.1-tf1.15-py3 is a valid image that will download if you don't already have it locally. As long as docker is able to connect to that registry host, it should pull it down no problem. Your docker image ls output indicates you have nvcr.io/nvidia/l4t-tensorflow:r32.6.1-tf2.5-py3 locally and not nvcr.io/nvidia/l4t-tensorflow:r32.6.1-tf1.15-py3
[23:11:36] <programmerq> you could change your command to use the image you have locally, or you could let the pull for nvcr.io/nvidia/l4t-tensorflow:r32.6.1-tf1.15-py3 run
[23:12:23] <XATRIX> damn

[23:13:54] <XATRIX> to make docker run any version of tensor, which it currently able to find on my local ?

[23:15:47] <ikke> :latest is an explicit tag that needs to exist
[23:15:50] <ikke> yes
[23:15:50] <programmerq> your docker image ls output did not show that you had the :latest

[23:22:20] <XATRIX> alright, seems like i must to specify it's tag. 
[23:22:21] <programmerq> although, it looks like there isn't a :latest tag in the repository, so I'm not sure why you're wondering about it.
[23:22:36] <programmerq> the only thing special about :latest is that if you don't explicitly specify a tag, docker acts like you typed :latest
[23:22:54] <programmerq> not every image author publishes that tag in their repository, and that appears to be the case for this image repository.
[23:22:56] <XATRIX> if thers's no :latest tage in repo. it won't mention it ? is it correct ? 
[23:23:18] <programmerq> that way the image author can force you to pick a specific tag by not having something at the default :latest for a non-specified tag.
