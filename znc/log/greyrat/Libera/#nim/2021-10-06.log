[13:39:56] <FromDiscord> <Rika> In reply to @impbox "defer lets you make": Here’s what defer does
[13:40:05] <FromDiscord> <NullCode> but this isn't inside a proc
[13:40:07] <FromDiscord> <NullCode> https://github.com/khchen/winim/blob/b7b32603f4ef672bc34405bc6200e8aab2c366b1/examples/fileopendialog.nim#L15
[13:40:31] <FromDiscord> <impbox [ftsf]> it's in the "main" ... proc?
[13:40:36] <FromDiscord> <impbox [ftsf]> not sure what you call it
[13:40:47] <FromDiscord> <Rika> Entry point function ?
[13:40:48] <FromDiscord> <impbox [ftsf]> but statements in global scope get called
[13:41:17] <FromDiscord> <NullCode> what
[13:41:30] <FromDiscord> <NullCode> main proc?
[13:41:50] <FromDiscord> <impbox [ftsf]> stuff outside any proc gets called immediately on start
[13:41:56] <FromDiscord> <NullCode> yes
[13:42:03] <FromDiscord> <impbox [ftsf]> you can kind of think of it as a proc
[13:42:05] <FromDiscord> <Rika> You can imagine that as the main proc
[13:42:06] <FromDiscord> <NullCode> oh so all those things are in a proc?
[13:42:13] <FromDiscord> <Rika> Technically
[13:42:13] <FromDiscord> <NullCode> "imagine" got it
[13:42:35] <FromDiscord> <Rika> But a defer outside any block actually doesn’t work afaik
[13:42:48] <FromDiscord> <Rika> So in that case it runs the code at the end of the try block
[13:42:51] <FromDiscord> <NullCode> so defer means the `CoBlaBlaBla` will happen at the very end?
[13:42:56] <FromDiscord> <impbox [ftsf]> i think it's technically different in some ways, but you could put it all in a proc main() and then call main() at the end if you wanted
[13:43:31] <FromDiscord> <NullCode> yeah understood

[13:51:41] <FromDiscord> <enthus1ast> winim is "just" a wrapper for the winapi, so the docs should be msdn i think
[13:51:55] <FromDiscord> <NullCode> but isn't msdn for c
[13:51:56] <FromDiscord> <NullCode> not for nim
[13:52:00] <FromDiscord> <NullCode> (edit) "c" => "c/cpp"
[13:52:03] <FromDiscord> <impbox [ftsf]> but the API is the same
[13:52:10] <FromDiscord> <impbox [ftsf]> well the nim one is based on the C one
[13:52:18] <FromDiscord> <NullCode> windows.h?
[13:52:19] <FromDiscord> <impbox [ftsf]> so i you understand the C one then the nim one will make sense
[13:52:23] <FromDiscord> <impbox [ftsf]> just the syntax is different
[13:52:30] <FromDiscord> <NullCode> oh i see
[13:52:45] <FromDiscord> <impbox [ftsf]> but same functions and arguments generally
[13:52:49] <FromDiscord> <enthus1ast> and winim tries to be very similar to c names
[13:54:04] <FromDiscord> <impbox [ftsf]> `  proc CreatePropertySheetPage(constPropSheetPagePointer: LPCPROPSHEETPAGEA): HPROPSHEETPAGE {.winapi, stdcall, dynlib: "comctl32", importc: "CreatePropertySheetPageA".}`↵eg the bit that says "import:" tells you what the C function is called

[13:54:29] <FromDiscord> <impbox [ftsf]> winim's `CreatePropertySheetPage` -> `CreatePropertySheetPageA` in C

[13:55:01] <FromDiscord> <impbox [ftsf]> yup
[13:56:40] <FromDiscord> <enthus1ast> what i always forget and must read on winim's docs is how the various winapi strings (chaos) map to nim types

[17:44:26] <FromDiscord> <Rika> its october....
[17:44:32] <FromDiscord> <Rika> what happened to this year
[17:44:38] <FromDiscord> <sealmove> yeah right!
[17:44:47] <FromDiscord> <sealmove> people losing track of time
[17:44:53] <FromDiscord> <Rika> year feels both long and short at the same time
[17:44:59] <nrds> <06Prestige99> about to be 2022, wow
[17:45:11] <FromDiscord> <sealmove> mostly felt long for me

[17:45:40] <FromDiscord> <Yardanico> imagine what would we feel in 2077
[17:45:46] <FromDiscord> <Rika> oh yeah isnt that two's day year

[17:54:00] <FromDiscord> <Schelz> nice thanks
[17:54:36] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> You can also use treeform/jsony and parse your request directly into data structure, if you will be extracting lots of fields from it
[18:24:38] <FromDiscord> <NullCode> In reply to @รєคɭ๓๏שє "mostly felt long for": here i am thinking how it went from april to october in 5 days
[18:25:10] <FromDiscord> <NullCode> tbh there should be a `py2nim`
[18:26:40] <FromDiscord> <Rika> guess what
[18:26:45] <FromDiscord> <Rika> theres a project regards that

[18:34:00] <FromDiscord> <NullCode> theres quite a lot of py2nim libs on github tho
[18:34:19] <FromDiscord> <NullCode> (edit) 04removed "tho"
[18:35:37] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> Making py2nim in general is an impossible task because there is so much about python code that is never written anywhere
[18:35:55] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> All of those implicit assumptions about what it the type of the variable, where it is first declared
[18:35:57] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> And so on
[18:36:05] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> But simple syntactic translation is possible
[18:36:18] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> If you add tons of unsafe hacks you cane make it close to python
[18:36:48] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> Because python is unsafe as it gets, with no type checking anywhere, except for some codebases that use optional type annotations
[18:36:57] <FromDiscord> <NullCode> In reply to @haxscramper "Making py2nim in general": yes
[18:37:06] <FromDiscord> <Rika> and theyre just annotations as well
[18:37:14] <FromDiscord> <Rika> no enforcement xd
[18:37:31] <FromDiscord> <NullCode> well one way to do it would be to force users to write Cython code
[18:37:34] <FromDiscord> <NullCode> and then transpile that
[18:37:49] <FromDiscord> <NullCode> cython has static typing iirc
[18:38:06] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> At this point you can just write nim directly
[18:38:17] <FromDiscord> <NullCode> true
[19:15:54] <FromDiscord> <Goel> Is it possible to have a `Table` as field type of an `object`?
[19:16:40] <FromDiscord> <Rika> yes?
[19:16:49] <FromDiscord> <Rika> what issues are you getting exactly
[19:17:44] <FromDiscord> <Goel> sent a code paste, see https://play.nim-lang.org/#ix=3B1v
[19:18:04] <FromDiscord> <enthus1ast> you must define what the table can store
[19:18:14] <FromDiscord> <enthus1ast> Table[string, Color] maybe
[19:18:22] <FromDiscord> <enthus1ast> or whatever you wanna store
[19:18:23] <FromDiscord> <Goel> oh i see
[19:18:37] <FromDiscord> <enthus1ast> the first one is the type of the key though
[19:18:37] <FromDiscord> <Rika> table is a generic like array and seq

[21:24:35] <nixfreak_nim[m]1> Hey guys good morning , I wanted to get some feedback from the chan about slowly migrating away from python/shell scripts to nim 
[21:25:05] <nixfreak_nim[m]1> I would like to start doing this on staging systems first then production systems 
[21:25:43] <nixfreak_nim[m]1> Does anyone have any experience with this ? 
[21:32:05] <supakeen> Yes, what do you want to know?
[21:47:56] <FromDiscord> <el__maco> I suppose there isn't a somewhat less ceremonial way to ignore return value from a function 🤔
[21:48:26] <FromDiscord> <el__maco> writing tons of ``discard`` everywhere feels like an overkill
[21:49:03] <nrds> <06Prestige99> Not that I know of
[21:49:21] <nrds> <06Prestige99> I think it's actually a good thing to acknowledge that you're throwing away a return value
[21:51:11] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> there is a not recommended workaround - adding `{.discardable.}` to the procedure declaration
[21:51:31] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> But generally it is not recommended to use, since explicitly annotating discarded value is better overall
[21:52:22] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> sent a code paste, see https://play.nim-lang.org/#ix=3B2j
[21:52:59] <FromDiscord> <el__maco> idk... one major appeal to me in this language is the signal-to-noise ratio compared to many other languages. The syntax is just so clean without any extra fluff. Discard in particular seems in the "noisy" side, if I ignore the return value I probably don't care about the return value 🤷‍♂️
[21:53:44] <FromDiscord> <el__maco> definitely trying this discardable specifier, thanks for the tip
[21:54:32] <FromDiscord> <el__maco> it seems to work, beautiful
[21:55:55] <FromDiscord> <enthus1ast> maybe the api is flawed when you have a ton of discards
[21:56:14] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Or is a C api
[21:56:22] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> sent a long message, see http://ix.io/3B2k
[21:56:29] <FromDiscord> <enthus1ast> true
[21:57:42] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> So it is either API misdesign or misuse, and ignoring return codes sometimes amounts to horrible bugs where system you are interfacing with is not in valid state
[21:58:31] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> That is - if half of the code is in discard statements all over
[21:58:31] <FromDiscord> <el__maco> many APIs feel obliged to return something from every function
[22:12:31] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> `#!/usr/bin/env -S nim r`
[22:13:29] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> I find it good for writing small automation scripts, and you can also make your own helper library for that purpose.
[22:14:32] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> And there are libraries like cligen if you need to make the script usable as a CLI tool
[22:20:17] <nrds> <06Prestige99> There are some libraries that return the same object you passed to it so you can chain function calls, that's usually the only time I use discard
[22:41:03] <FromDiscord> <qb> umm, Is there an xor assignment operator in nim?

[22:51:48] *** Joins: Gustavo6046 (~Gustavo60@user/gustavo6046)
[23:02:28] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> There is not but you can always make one if you want it
[23:02:37] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> wouldnt be named `xor=` though
[23:04:30] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> sent a code paste, see https://play.nim-lang.org/#ix=3B2F
[23:16:59] <FromDiscord> <Goel> SDL library does that too, returns a -1 almost on all procs to check if it succeeded or not, and in the end it means a lot of ugly `discard` everywhere. Fortunatly `{.discardable.}` cleans it by a lot
[23:18:05] <nrds> <06Prestige99> I usually use that return 'code' then display the sdl error message
[23:18:19] <FromDiscord> <Goel> (edit) "lot" => "lot. But in the end is about priority. For example the `-1` on `init()` or other main procs are a must have, while others are not needed at all and just overkill"
[23:20:06] <nixfreak_nim[m]1> supakeen: did you start porting from shell and python?
[23:25:28] <supakeen> no, i started the rule that any program that could be rewritten within a working day was allowed to be written in any language a programmer likes
[23:25:48] <supakeen> which did indeed mostly involve small shell scripts and assorted tidbits
[23:28:51] <FromDiscord> <sealmove> another perfect use case for Nim seems to be devops
[23:29:39] <supakeen> we mostly had a bunch of small forwarding or information gathering programs that run on a lot of virtual machines, those were historically written in python
[23:29:51] <supakeen> those small programs were easily ported to nim and RES savings were very good :)
[23:30:43] <supakeen> losing 50MB here or there on daemons that run on all VMs is a lot of memory saved even with dedup
[23:47:23] <FromDiscord> <Yardanico> dedup?
[23:47:38] <FromDiscord> <Yardanico> what kind of software allows you to have ram deduplication?
[23:49:16] <FromDiscord> <leorize> linux's ksm can dedup ram
[23:50:07] <FromDiscord> <Yardanico> how well does that work 🤔
