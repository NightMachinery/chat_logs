[02:08:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> Wow, where to start
[02:08:20] <kuudes> thanks
[02:08:20] <Obormot\Arcturus> 1. Ukraine has natural resources, and more of those is pretty much always better
[02:08:54] <gwern> (like the strawberries and blueberries. who doesn't need more of those?)
[02:10:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> 2. Russia has plenty of land but a lot of is land where nobody wants to live; compare population densities of the two countries: 69/km^2 vs. 8 for Russia
[02:11:01] <Obormot\Arcturus> 3. Distracting the populace from domestic problems is worth going to a lot of trouble, this kind of thing is a time-tested way of doing that
[02:11:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> 4. Dictators like power and want more power, and territorial expansion = more power

[02:12:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> 5. If Putin annexes a chunk of territory and nobody does anything to stop him, he demonstrates that he can do this, which improves his negotiating position w.r.t. other nations by demonstrating his power
[02:13:59] <Obormot\Arcturus> 6. Russian-speaking populations of ethnic enclaves in other Eastern Bloc nations are almost invariably more nationalistic than average, so adding them to Russia's population instantly gives Putin more supporters

[20:21:46] <Robomot> News from Nowhere - Wikipedia (News from Nowhere (1890) is a classic work combining utopian socialism and soft science fiction written by the artist, designer and socialist pioneer William Morris. It was first published in serial form in the Commonweal journal beginning on 11 January 1890.)
[20:21:47] <Robomot> News from Nowhere
[20:22:43] <Obormot\Arcturus> "In the novel, the narrator, William Guest, falls asleep after returning from a meeting of the Socialist League and awakes to find himself in a future society based on common ownership and democratic control of the means of production. In this society there is no private property, no big cities, no authority, no monetary system, no marriage or divorce, no courts, no prisons, and no class systems. This agrarian society
[20:22:43] <Obormot\Arcturus>  functions simply because the people find pleasure in nature, and therefore they find pleasure in their work." ... "Yes, this we also intended to try, thought Rumata. Mass hypnoinduction, positive remoralization. Hypno-emitters on three equatorial satellites…"

[20:26:21] <Obormot\Arcturus> So Morris apparently read Bellamy's _Looking Backward_, thought "this sounds horrible, actually", and decided to write his own socialist utopia
[20:28:40] <Obormot\Arcturus> But his answer to "if not an all-powerful state ensuring the perfection of the world, then what" turned out to be "human nature magically changes in precisely the ways that make my vision plausible, while social mores stay the same despite political-economic shifts (presumably also by magic)"
[20:29:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> e.g. women conveniently continue to mostly do domestic work, but now they do it because they enjoy it
[20:30:51] <kuudes> so, wireheading
[20:31:09] <kuudes> I guess they also have plenty of paperclips
[20:31:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> Fortunately, Morris had a knockdown response to critics:
[20:31:40] <Obormot\Arcturus> "And, again, that leads me to my last claim, which is that the material surroundings of my life should be pleasant, generous, and beautiful; that I know is a large claim, but this I will say about it, that if it cannot be satisfied, if every civilised community cannot provide such surroundings for all its members, I do not want the world to go on."
[20:32:16] <Obormot\Arcturus> In other words, "oh you say the world can never be as I want it to be? well then FUCK THE WORLD"
[20:32:22] <Obormot\Arcturus> I can sympathize with this!
[20:32:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> Can't win the game? Flip the table
[20:33:10] <ardent[m]> "Morality stays the same" is something I see too often in sci-fi and speculative fiction in general... generally speaking I'd say if every alien civilization is less morally alien than the Roman Empire, then the description of them is suffering from this issue.
[20:37:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> Anyway, the whole "people should enjoy work and learning" thing... it's interesting, there's some writers/thinkers who had the idea that this should/would just be instilled in people, as the basis for the socialist utopia (e.g. the hypno-training in _Brave New World_), which is what the Strugatskys were mocking with that line I quoted before, but... Morris's view seems to have been that people *already do* enjoy work and
[20:37:27] <Obormot\Arcturus>  learning, *if* it is creative work and free, self-directed learning, *which all work/learning should be*
[20:37:56] <Obormot\Arcturus> (An unsurprising view given his background/associations)

[21:11:35] <kiboneu> what is this vibe camp thing
[21:11:52] <kiboneu> https://vibecamp.xyz/about/ ?
[21:11:53] <Robomot> About Vibe Camp (2020’s lockdowns affected everyone, challenging our standing routines of being social, thoughtful, and active in the world. Many of us directed our unused energy online, forging new connections and friendships, and finding communities to be part of across the internet. TCOT (This Corner of Twitter) has come to be)
[21:12:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> pompolic: Well, the thing is, the character actually is 4 bytes, lol
[21:12:05] <pompolic> at least i think it's something like that. i don't recall how exactly the unicode is packed, but it would line up if it was 1 unicode nybble per 1 utf8 byte
[21:12:10] <pompolic> huh
[21:12:14] <pompolic> i'm wrong, my bad
[21:12:21] <kiboneu> jesus that sounds like a bad idea
[21:12:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> But the string representation of the code point value is 5 bytes
[21:12:34] <pompolic> yes
[21:12:35] <kiboneu> inviting all the twitter people to a physical location to camp
[21:12:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> Well, 5 characters, anyhow
[21:12:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> (But also 5 bytes in UTF8 because it's all low ASCII, of course)
[21:13:32] <pompolic> "utf8 is at most 4 bytes" meant to express assuming the represantion is <= 4 bytes
[21:14:18] <kuudes> whats the vibe meme?
[21:14:38] <kiboneu> it looks like the beginning of a cult
[21:14:48] <kuudes> how is it related to the channel?
[21:14:52] <kiboneu> backlog
[21:14:56] <pompolic> what i think happens is the decoder stops after processing 4 bytes unconditionally, rather than looking at the "continue" bit
[21:14:58] <kuudes> ... how far
[21:15:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> kuudes: These "vibe" people are Twitter post-rationalists
[21:15:17] <kiboneu> kuudes, man, i don't really feel like counting lines
[21:15:19] <kuudes> why are they relevant to us?
[21:15:37] <kiboneu> because Obormot\Arcturus mentioned it?
[21:15:39] <Obormot\Arcturus> kuudes: They've just progressed so far beyond, like, *words* and stuff that they'd never actually used the term "rationalist" or anything
[21:15:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> They're just "the ingroup"
[21:15:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> "vibing" with each other
[21:15:58] <kiboneu> wait, these are rationalist offshoots?
[21:16:00] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yes
[21:16:04] <kiboneu> ah
[21:16:09] <Obormot\Arcturus> Distantly
[21:16:10] <kuudes> gwern mentioned them first, not Obormot\Arcturus
[21:16:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> Sort of rationalist-adjacent-adjacent-adjacent
[21:16:20] <kuudes> but yes, there are a lot of rationalist related loonies

[21:16:22] <linear> merry christmas #lesswrong <3
[21:16:26] <kuudes> some of them matter, some of them not
[21:16:49] <kuudes> I am trying to understand if they are in the matter category or not, and if they are, what should I know
[21:17:15] <Obormot\Arcturus> kuudes: If you absolutely must have a direct relevance relation: at least one person from this channel has expressed an intention of attending vibe camp
[21:17:38] <kuudes> oh
[21:17:44] <pompolic> i'm confused now. UTF-8 is apparently in fact defined to be at most 4 bytes. but i've seen longer UTF8 in the wild
[21:17:50] <kuudes> who, so I can lower their status or something
[21:18:00] <pompolic> but i think this explains it: "A "character" can actually take more than 4 bytes, e.g. an emoji flag character takes 8 bytes since it's "constructed from a pair of Unicode scalar values".[16]"
[21:18:09] <kiboneu> Obormot\Arcturus: how could one seriously write "hey this is twitter but come hang out with us inb meatspace" in an invitation
[21:18:14] <kiboneu> without cringing or dying inside
[21:18:19] <Obormot\Arcturus> kiboneu: Don't think too hard about it, man
[21:18:19] <feep> pompolic: UTF-8 is "defined" to be 4 bytes at most
[21:18:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> kiboneu: Just wait for the inevitable LW thinkpiece
[21:18:27] <feep> people have ignored that with abandon
[21:18:38] <pompolic> that they did
[21:18:52] <Obormot\Arcturus> pompolic: Variation selectors, skin tone selectors, combining marks, etc.
[21:18:58] <feep> I mean, even beyond the emoji dual value thing
[21:19:06] <pompolic> yeah
[21:19:14] <feep> the utf-8 format is so cleanly defined that there's unambiguous encodings up to 6 bytes or so
[21:19:43] <kiboneu> lw thotleader camp
[21:20:57] <kuudes> feep, what about flagcase?
[21:21:50] <pompolic> feep: i didn't know this, but empirically, yeah, i think i've seen sequences like that, and that's what made me (wrongly) conclude that UTF-8 is >4 bytes per spec
[21:21:56] <pompolic> should've read the spec harder
[21:22:45] <pompolic> it also occurs to me that looking at the "continue" bit is bad news langsecwise
[21:23:03] <pompolic> in-band signalling is difficult
[21:23:23] <pompolic> so i retract my opinion
[21:24:53] <pompolic> feep: i'm also not sure if "unambiguous" is correct, because while they are invalid, overlong sequences do exist
[21:25:57] <pompolic> i think i'm mixing up theory and practice seamlessly
[21:26:21] <feep> oyeah true
[21:26:34] <feep> I mean in the way that the format unambigously extends beyond four bytes
[21:26:39] <Gurkenglas> <kiboneu> without cringing or dying inside <- ehh? because it indicates that one has few meatspace people to hang out with?
[21:27:16] <pompolic> feep: oh yeah, that makes sense and that's how i originally read it. thanks

Can you coherently say how reality might look, if our universe did not have the kind of structure that appears in a causal model? I can describe to you at least one famous universe that didn't look like it had causal …)

[23:28:01] <pompolic> except what you're trying to produce is something like, a program that has a "top" and a "bottom" half, where the top and bottom halves call into each other at least once, and the bottom half is just the top half reversed
[23:29:00] <pompolic> (the two halves corresponding to two universes, not before/after midpoint)

This time my visit was much shorter, but I had three dominant impressions. First, the city seems more “normal” and less Argentine than in times past. The nicer parts of town, as you might find in or near Palermo, seemed […])
