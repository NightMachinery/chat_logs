[11:52:43] <Orbstheorem> This is nice.
[13:42:38] <Orbstheorem> Arf...
[13:42:47] <Orbstheorem> Spotify is removing music I like listening to :/
[13:43:13] <Orbstheorem> On one hand, I like the possibility of listening to music I don't know with ease.

[14:22:40] <artectrex[m]> <Orbstheorem> "Spotify is removing music I like..." <- oh no the wolves are eating me :(
[14:22:54] <Orbstheorem> TouchÃ©
[14:39:20] <artectrex[m]> A little puzzle I've been trying to solve: about 10 days ago my server exploded (maybe literally, not sure)
[14:39:20] <artectrex[m]> I am out of the country it is in until tomorrow, so I have only some feedback from remote troubleshooting steps I made a layman do
[14:39:20] <artectrex[m]> Apparently the general circuit breaker was triggered multiple times when they connected the circuit the server was on. Also, when turning it on, the PSU fan spins for half a second and then turns off. When off, the server normally has an LED that is _on_. It was still on so I guess some power must be flowing?
[14:39:20] <artectrex[m]> My server is a ryzen pc basically, so I ordered a PSU and motherboard and was planning on returning one of the two if possible
[14:39:31] <artectrex[m]> Is the PSU the thing that is borked?
[14:40:10] <artectrex[m]> Or is the motherboard or graphics card short-circuiting and tripping the circuit breaker while the PSU is fine?
[14:40:38] <artectrex[m]> if the PSU is borked, what are the chances my motherboard is doing fine
[14:41:11] <artectrex[m]> Is it possible my CPU is dead because of this?
[15:09:39] <artectrex[m]> <Orbstheorem> "On one hand, I like the possibil..." <- discovery is kinda hard I agree.. I mostly listen to one d&b label and a couple of people I follow through RSS feeds and get their music on bandcamp and/or with youtube-dl
[15:16:25] <Orbstheorem> > When off, the server normally has an LED that is on. It was still on
[15:16:25] <Orbstheorem> That means nothing: PSU usually have 'always on' power rails. But says very little about the rest. That said, chances are your PSU may still be alive.
[15:17:30] <Orbstheorem> <artectrex[m]> "Or is the motherboard or..." <- If anything after your PSU (and assuming your PSU is not crap) then the PSU will trigger but it shouldn't propagate.
[15:17:38] <Orbstheorem> <artectrex[m]> "Is it possible my CPU is dead..." <- Yes.
[15:19:08] <Orbstheorem> > when turning it on, the PSU fan spins for half a second and then turns off
[15:19:08] <Orbstheorem> Either your motherboard shuts the PSU off or the PSU shuts itself off (e.g. ocp, like a short).
[15:36:55] <artectrex[m]> <Orbstheorem> "Yes." <- ðŸ˜¥
[15:39:41] <artectrex[m]> I have a PC with working parts available and was thinking of using it to troubleshoot what needs replacing to maybe avoid having to open parts that are not broken. Would it be safe to use its power supply? Or am I risking frying that too ðŸ¤”

[19:33:54] <Orbstheorem> - The CPU in the working PC
[19:33:54] <Orbstheorem> - The working PSU in the broken system.
