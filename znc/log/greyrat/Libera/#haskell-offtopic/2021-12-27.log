[12:59:36] <tomsmeding> turlando: are you willing to move to a different country for your MSc? I can say good things about the PL group at Utrecht University in NL, but that's not quite southern italiy
[13:00:30] <tomsmeding> but I don't yet have a good view on other good universities in europe for this field
[13:03:52] <tomsmeding> in my experience (of doing the MSc at Utrecht) it's a relatively demanding study program, but that's deduced from just 2 data points: 1. the step between my CS bachelor at Leiden Uni in NL and the master was larger than I expected, and 2. I once spoke to someone from Greece who had done a bachelor in CS there, and to my ears that sounded more like programming, not CS -- and they were
[13:03:53] <tomsmeding> having difficulty here (not sure if they ever made it)

[15:47:02] <turlando> tomsmeding: Thank you for sharing your opinion. On one hand I'm not so keen on moving in this period, on the other hand if I want to do a more interesting MSc that's the only option I guess. I've checked Utrecht as it's a quite famed university and the program looks interesting. If I may ask what kind of difficulties did you find? Another aspect is that, having already lived in the NL for a while, it ain't cheap at all so having a scholarship 
[15:47:02] <turlando> would be nice but I have to check yet what the requirements are.
[15:51:43] <tomsmeding> turlando: Fully understand you're not really looking forward to moving abroad in the current times. :) As for difficulties, for me not really anything specific, just that if a course is rated for 7.5 ECTS, you're likely to spend all of those 7.5*28 hours. :p
[15:53:10] <tomsmeding> as for living, housing is currently quite expensive in NL. I believe the uni may provide (temporary?) housing for international students, but you'd have to research that because I'm not sure
[15:53:44] * tomsmeding is just n=1 though
[15:55:09] <turlando> The funny thing is that the tuition fees are way cheaper than what I pay for my current university that, it's not a mistery, has lower standards
[15:58:45] <turlando> Do you have any opinion about other universities in NL? For instance why you didn't do your MSc at Leiden? Or what about UVA/VU?
[16:00:02] *** Joins: eggplantade (~Eggplanta@2600:1700:bef1:5e10:b417:46a:3118:ab81)
[16:00:39] <tomsmeding> turlando: what's "way cheaper"? Fur Dutch citizens our government pays a large part of the actual tuition so that we pay roughly 2000 per year; I thought this was different for students from abroad
[16:01:37] <tomsmeding> VU I don't really know, UVA you should ask merijn IIRC; for Leiden, I did my BSc there, but at the time they didn't really have a PL program, and last I checked they still don't (though they are strong in other areas)
[16:02:19] <tomsmeding> how did you end up in NL earlier? :)
[16:02:19] <turlando> Tuition fees at Utrecht are cheaper than my local uni (not accounting for economic incentives though)
[16:02:32] <tomsmeding> interesting
[16:02:43] * tomsmeding thought tuition was synchronised across all dutch unis
[16:03:11] <turlando> I was comparing Utrecht with my local uni in IT, not sure about the rest of NL :)
[16:03:20] <tomsmeding> sure

[16:05:59] <turlando> I worked in Amsterdam for one year and something at a startup (now defunct) doing Clojure development and infrastructure stuff. I have excellent memories of that experience and would do it again, the only hassle as you can imagine is housing and while I can afford to move and find new apartments while I'm working, studying requires a completely different level of mental concentration and I'm not sure I would be able to stand it
[16:07:20] <tomsmeding> I see! Cool stuff
[16:07:26] <turlando> After that I've done my BSc back in Italy, that was quite some time ago
[16:07:47] <tomsmeding> Amsterdam is the worst in terms of housing currently; Utrecht is also bad but second place I think
[16:09:32] <turlando> Knowing the situation in Amsterdam that doesn't reassure me for sure :)
[16:13:11] <tomsmeding> check what the uni arranges for you

[22:33:10] <[exa]> french & german institutions (esp. inria), there are surprisingly good places with brilliant people that "just" do not do the headlines on hackernews everyday 4] "losing a year" is a great decision if you lose it constructively
