[00:50:06] <cosimone> notification-daemon seems to be a "virtual" package that can be provided by multiple "concrete" packages, that's what bugs me
[00:50:29] <cosimone> i understand actual binaries not being able to be installed side by side, but this doesn't seem to be the case
[00:51:29] <somiaj> Ahh, looking at the tracker I didn't realize that it had become a virtual package.
[00:51:41] <cosimone> it basically only contains messages: https://packages.debian.org/bullseye/amd64/notification-daemon/filelist
[00:51:59] *** Joins: eventhorizon5 (~smuxi@184.170.167.152)
[00:52:16] <cosimone> i see no reason why these wouldn't work for other architectures too, please correct me if i'm missing something here
[00:52:59] <somiaj> Maybe you haven't identified the actual conflict. You have some i386 package which depends on the virtiaul package notification-daemon?
[00:53:50] <somiaj> cosimone: which depends of pcsx2 depends on notification-daemon? I don't see a direct depends.
[00:54:29] <cosimone> it is not direct, but there seems to be an indirect "recommends"
[00:54:46] <cosimone> if i install it with --no-install-recommends, i don't get notification-daemon:i386
[00:55:36] <somiaj> I would use something like apt-rdepends and see if you can figure out what package is causing this conflict. Maybe it is worth filing a bug about this

[00:57:35] *** Quits: nobyk- (~nobyk@user/nobyk) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[00:58:06] <cosimone> i found it: pcsx2 directly depends on  libwxgtk3.0-gtk3-0v5:i386, which directly depends on libnotify4:i386, which recommends (not depends) on notification-daemon:i386
[00:58:26] <kyle__> How do you flush buffered messages from rsyslog?
[00:58:56] <cosimone> but i don't think it's about pcsx2 or any other "indirect" pacakge, it's specifically about notification-daemon not being multiarch, even though it should work for at least both amd64 and i386
[00:59:11] <kyle__> I found my local syslog server was full down after a poweroutage for a bit, and now that I have it up again, it's getting _hammered_ by servers sending old buffered messages.
[00:59:21] <kyle__> I don't care aobut those, and would rather drop them for now.
[00:59:39] <cosimone> if i try running "apt install notification-daemon notification-daemon:i386", i get a conflict and apt refuses to go on
[00:59:41] <somiaj> cosimone: well in this case it is a virtual package, so the idea of multiarch won't be important there. Might be something about virtual packages not having an arch at all.
[01:00:10] <cosimone> i think this could be solved by making notification-daemon multiarch
[01:00:27] <cosimone> oh, and just fyi, my native arch is amd64
[01:00:40] <somiaj> but it is a virtual package, which isn't a real package, and the packages that provide these virtual package are not multiarch and probably cannot be multiarch.
[01:01:05] <cosimone> can't non-multiarch packages depend on multiarch packages?
[01:01:29] <somiaj> hmm, well I see a physical package too, not quite sure what is going on here, but yea, there is some issue, I would report a bug

[01:04:06] <somiaj> no it isn't, there is an actual package with various files, but it can also be provided by other packages. So isn't fully virtual.
[01:04:40] <somiaj> My guess is also the i386 libnotify daemon might be able to work with the amd64 notification-daemon, so it might just be some issue with how apt resovles depends.

[02:09:25] <bls> The fact that you're so set on doing screen sharing makes me wonder what kind of virus or other invasive crap you're going to try to do
[02:09:29] <karlpinc> Awaru: I'm just explaining how it works here.  Don't blame me for the social conventions.
[02:09:46] <sney> but Khepra, they've done 100 debian installs and 2 IT apprenticeships, we should be learning from them not the other way around
[02:09:49] <Awaru> i fkn want help damn donk... i say since 15mins come to the site with monitor sharing
[02:09:50] <bls> I'm done on this topic unless Awaru shifts his position

[17:16:31] <Khepra> unless you're comparing literally on the same hardware env with no extraneous factors, this comparison is useless
[17:16:39] <aog> the same instance type doesn't mean you're necessarily getting the exact same configuration behind the scenes

[17:23:17] <Khepra> okay, let me put it this way. spectre and meltdown mitigations benchmarks have identified loads that are syscall heavy, vs loads that are not. the former are VERY affected by mitigations
[17:23:46] <Khepra> that's why you read stuff like "beteween 5% and 50% depending on the load". that's why some people shrug, and others scream bloody gore because their syscall heavy use case falls in the latter category

[20:36:48] <PerfDave> Enissay: I don't know exactly what steps you take to do this, but if I were trying to give a random third party root access to my system, I would: (1) Set them up with a normal user account with SSH auth (2) run tmux or screen as my own user (3) set up logging of tmux/screen terminal (4) allow tmux/screen terminal to be shared with the remote user (5) run something like "sudo -i" inside the shared
[20:36:54] <PerfDave> terminal which the other user now has access to.
[20:37:08] <PerfDave> That way you should have a terminal they can run commands in, which is logging as your user account, so their user account can't tamper with the logs

[20:42:37] <PerfDave> There might be a HOWTO on how to do that somewhere on the Internet. If not, I should think about writing one.
[20:44:35] <PerfDave> I mean there's still the possibility that the other person can use the root access to mess with your terminal log, but unless they intend to hand-craft a realistic replacement (or just edit out the bit where they put the backdoors in), it's not a terrible solution. And you could possibly use script as jmcnaught suggested, on the terminal you're SSHing *into* the shared server, to try and spot that.

[22:03:58] *** Quits: i0e (~is0ke3@user/is0ke3) (Ping timeout: 272 seconds)
[22:04:58] <kee> urk: If it genuinely isn't there (it might just be hidden), the first step is to take an image of the drive. Then run a tool like scalpel over the image, searching for whatever fragments of the mission-critical files you can remember.
[22:05:05] <kee> That'll see if the data still exists on the disk.
[22:05:29] *** Joins: i0e (~is0ke3@user/is0ke3)
[22:05:59] <urk> kee:  I clonsed the drive with Clonezilla.  Is that ok, or should I image it with something else?
[22:06:02] <kee> I don't see why R Studio would help you recover files, nor why restoring from trash would behave like that.
[22:06:06] <kee> urk: That should work, yeah.
[22:06:14] <kee> When did you clone it: before or after you tried restoring?
[22:06:58] <kee> If you cloned it before you restored from trash, it's pretty trivial to get the data back (assuming it was really in the trash in the first place).
[22:07:32] *** Joins: TeRRoR_MuDa (~muda@user/TeRRoR-MuDa/x-2746693)
[22:07:48] <urk> I cloned the drive after an attempted restore.  Big mistake.
[22:07:59] <kee> That's your only cloned copy?
[22:08:16] <kee> No matter. You can still search through the image to see if the files exist.
[22:08:22] <kee> It's just you might not have the directory structure.
[22:08:26] <kee> HDD or SSD?
[22:08:35] <TeRRoR_MuDa> what back up utitity do you guys use
[22:08:43] <urk> SSD
[22:08:48] <kee> Ah.
[22:09:06] <kee> How mission critical was the data?
[22:09:07] <urk> TeRRoR-MuDa:  I usually use Timeshift, but it has its limitations.
[22:09:16] <urk> kee:  Very important.
[22:09:21] <TeRRoR_MuDa> yea thats the one i have
[22:09:31] <TeRRoR_MuDa> it feels like the only solid option for debian among a few others
[22:09:34] <kee> Do you remember any substrings from the file? (And which file formats?)
[22:11:02] <kee> And ext4 filesystem?

[22:11:53] *** Joins: gildasio1 (~gildasio@gateway/tor-sasl/gildasio)
[22:12:29] <kee> urk: Knowing the file formats might be enough to undelete the files, if they're still there.
[22:12:48] <kee> Undeletion tools normally have a check for "has this file been deleted?".
[22:12:58] *** Quits: gildasio (~gildasio@gateway/tor-sasl/gildasio) (Remote host closed the connection)
[22:12:59] <kee> So it won't just list every matching file on your computer.

[22:16:52] <urk> kee:  I am using ext4
[22:17:20] <urk> Only thing I remember is the name of the sub-folder that is missing, and it was a pretty good size folder.
[22:17:28] <kee> What kinds of files were in it?
[22:18:01] <urk> kee:  .odt, pdf, png, notepad, etc.
[22:18:05] <kee> (Well done for imaging it at all, btw. Most people don't image it, and get progressively more panicked and trash any hope of finding the files.)
[22:18:19] <kee> Most of those have nice easy-to-find magic numbers!
[22:18:28] <kee> I think scalpel actually has some of those built in.
[22:19:00] <kee> (Scalpel isn't a good file recovery tool, but it always finds the files if they're present. So long as they're not so huge they were split across several non-contiguous blocks.)
[22:19:03] <urk> I installed scalpel, but not sure where to begin.  imagefile preview?
[22:19:14] <kee> It has a GUI‽
[22:19:36] *** Joins: bls (~bls@192.182.149.233)
[22:19:52] <urk> kee:  This was a sub-folder of the Documents folder.  According to Testdisk I have a bad partition, so its probably a good idea to do some more backups besides the clone that I made.
[22:20:47] <kee> Creating a copy of the clone, and running fsck on it, might help.
[22:21:02] <kee> But make sure you create a copy; fsck usually ruins any hope of recovering data.
[22:21:04] <urk> I was using XFCE, but switched over to LXDE awhile back after XFCE corrupted. I knew I needed to do some system repairs or work, but haven't gotten around to it.  I am going to try copying stuff today, and then use scalpel to find some things.
[22:21:41] <kee> If there are bad partitions, I usually use ddrescue to get the data.
[22:22:04] <urk> My USB is only 1.7TB, but I should buy a larger USB anyway, and I am borrowing one from someone in the house.  Most of my USBs are 256gb and 500GB so probably not big enough.
[22:22:07] <kee> ddrescue can deal with failing hard drives. (Though SSDs usually fail by just returning garbage data, because badly-made SSDs refuse to admit that they're failing.)
[22:22:45] <kee> ddrescue is an imaging tool btw, not a data recovery tool.
[22:22:46] <urk> ddrescue:  Not sure if this is a failing hard drive as opposed to a bad partition.  Usually there will be warning messages in Debian announcing the drive is bad.

[22:23:44] <urk> kee:  I have a Dell XPS 15 7590, and have had more than my share of corrupted data.  I suspected a failing drive from the start, but nothing definitive.
[22:24:08] <kee> If you've had any corrupted data, that's either power failure, a faulty connection or a failing drive.

[22:24:35] <sussudio> debsums -c will check if debian installed files are okay
[22:24:35] <urk> Probably a failing drive then. I have not had a power failure, nor faulty connection.
[22:24:45] <kee> But I can't think why the documents folder would've ended up in the Trash…
