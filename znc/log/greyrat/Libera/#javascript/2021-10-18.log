[00:04:34] <Gamara> what kind of masochist designed this
[00:04:47] <bomb> Xerox
[00:05:11] <Gamara> They designed text but they didnt implement it being drawn in canvas
[00:05:22] <Gamara> the api is horriable

[00:05:56] <Gamara> why would you put the center the bottom right, then provide no (Useful and consistant) api to provide font height/width
[00:06:32] *** s is now known as Swantvee
[00:06:52] <bomb> 40 years of heritage Gamara. like why farting is socially unacceptable while letting the excess gas out of your body is very convenient?

[00:07:15] <Gamara> still its annoying I am forced to use svg images
[00:07:37] <Gamara> just to write very very basic text
[00:07:38] <bomb> what's wrong with SVG? it's declarative all the way
[00:07:39] <doc> bomb: you need better friends
[00:07:56] <Gamara> nothing wrong with SVG
[00:08:08] <Gamara> but I shouldnt need it to draw text
[00:08:20] <bomb> well, matching the SVG typography in raw canvas from scratch requires a lot of work
[00:08:41] <Gamara> all they had to do was come up with a way to get text height/width
[00:08:52] <bomb> Gamara: why don't you try a library that renders on canvas? like this one: http://paperjs.org/

[00:12:08] <Gamara> it doesnt work
[00:12:16] <Gamara> I just messed with it for an hour
[00:12:26] <ljharb> bomb: i doubt it'll change any of the realities that drive my opinions :-)
[00:12:52] <ljharb> bomb: for example, the first one, "Making impossible states impossible and exhaustive checks" typescript doesn't actually achieve this, because it has no runtime checks of any kind.
[00:13:05] <ljharb> bomb: the other two are valid, but meh
[00:13:14] <bomb> but compiler checks useful as well lj

[10:47:28] <thykka> well i mean, you're trying to make a new thing by iterating through something, so reduce would be a good fit there..
[10:47:56] <thykka> reduce's second param lets you initialize the array, and not keep track of it outside of the reducer function

[11:01:02] <teut> reduce is for  like computing sum etc , how then too it fits good here?
[11:01:23] <thykka> teut, instead of reducing to a number, you reduce to an array
[11:01:43] <biberu> reduce is a much more general operation than that

[11:12:41] <teut> ya, that I was going to ask, thanks for telling
[11:13:21] <thykka> also, instead of previous + [], do previous.push(<Card ...>)
[11:14:01] <thykka> make sure you always return `previous` (which is a misleading name here, tbh)
[11:14:15] <thykka> it's usually called an accumulator
[11:14:25] <teut> ok i ll name it that
[11:14:44] <teut> previous.push ??
[11:15:01] <thykka> it's an array, and you wish to append items to it, right?
[11:15:07] <teut> does push return something?
[11:15:44] <teut> [...previous, <Card data={val} />]
[11:15:51] <teut> what about this?
[11:16:41] <teut> ok , I ll make it 2 lines  by using { }
[11:17:41] <thykka> push returns the new length of the array, which isn't super useful here

[22:05:57] <lmat> Maybe to put it another way: I have a javascript file, thatjs.js, with     var myVar = "hey"; var myOther = "nope";. After    <script src="thatjs.js"></script>   any scripts later can simply    console.log(myVar); to print a variable that was declared in the script. This is the old javascript way. I would like to webpack this file and use it exactly the same way.
[22:07:27] <stenno> you can export those variables in a CJS module and then webpack will handle imports i _thiiink_

[23:53:25] <theskillwithin> velix it was a pizza emoji
[23:53:32] <velix> theskillwithin: LoL :-)
[23:53:50] <velix> This mall pizza is - really - the best I've ever eaten.
[23:53:56] <velix> 6 different kinds.
[23:54:13] <velix> It's pre-baken, not frozen because this finish it on demand.
[23:54:21] <velix> So you can finish it in the oven at home.
[23:54:30] <velix> It's not dry and it's not covinience.
[23:54:39] <velix> covid-ience :D
[23:54:40] <silly> i've installed some emoji font, but it's all black and white and 10px fontsize isn't enough for this
