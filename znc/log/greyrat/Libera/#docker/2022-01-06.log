[18:41:44] <programmerq> you could probably use macvlan or ipvlan with a parent interface that is that bridge.
[18:42:02] <programmerq> and you'd need to hand docker's ipam a range of ips that it can use to assign to containers.
[18:42:27] <programmerq> also, you'd need to tell docker about the gateway ip on that network so that containers can egress.

[19:32:14] <programmerq> bancroft‚ñ∏ the env vars in the Dockerfile can only refer to previously defined env vars in that Dockerfile/base image. It can't determine what the default $PATH setting is going to be when the shell inside the Dockerfile runs. You could export the PATH in an entrypoint script, or maybe a bashrc or similar.
[19:32:54] <programmerq> Tach‚ñ∏ when you publish a port in swarm, it makes every node in the cluster publish the port. There's also host-mode publishing where it only publishes the port on the hosts where the tasks are running.

If your compose file that you provide to a stack has a mapping, it'll publish just fine. For example if your 'ports:' section has "8080:8080" then it'll make all swarm nodes listen on 8080 and map that to the service vip for that service on port 8080.

[23:54:02] <snedd> Silly question inbound: When writing the following line for a volume in docker-compose (For example) "dist:/app/dist". Should I think of this as more of a symlink, or is it making a copy of the host contents into the container?
[23:54:47] <programmerq> a volume in docker is just a directory. it is not a copy. it's kind of like a symlink, but it's actually a bind mount.
[23:55:07] <programmerq> basically, the directory in question that is on your host is simply made available at the location in the container. it has the same inode and everything
[23:55:35] <programmerq> a named volume is a docker concept and it basically lets dockerd create the directory on your host for you. That's what happens when you use a named volume in compose.
[23:55:59] <programmerq> a "bind mount" in the docker verbiage is where you explicitly specify the path to the directory (or file) in question on the host.
[23:56:20] <programmerq> so in a compose file, volumes: might have "- /home/programmerq/mydata:/path/to/data"
[23:57:21] <programmerq> now if you're using docker desktop or otherwise running docker in a VM, that host path is as seen by the dockerd process itself. Docker desktop sets up a file sharing thing so that your path on your mac or windows host is visible to the dockerd running in the vm
