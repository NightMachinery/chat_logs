[00:20:31] <raph_ael> imode: is bcd the english word for marijuana without thc ?
[00:20:40] <imode> heh
[00:20:55] <imode> that'd be CBD, but no, BCD == binary coded decimal.

[00:23:57] <buttsbot> Does ES6 make JavaScript frameworks obsolete? - Stack Overflow Blog
[00:24:14] <dminkovsky> "es6" is like 3 years old or something
[00:24:36] <dminkovsky> es6 is, one could say (i would say), sort of obsolete
[00:24:51] <dminkovsky> also, the frameworks thing is long over
[00:25:08] <dminkovsky> someone forgot to post this like 4 years ago or something?
[00:27:43] <ngoldbaum> has no one come up with the react-killer?

[00:30:55] <dminkovsky> if that's brett's first action, that's awesome
[00:32:13] <dminkovsky> have never enjoyed that site and brett's take is why
[00:32:14] <riv> good
[00:34:42] <dminkovsky> indigo: you're definitely onto something w/ FearJS
[00:35:58] <Xe> i am tired lol
[00:37:08] <imode> FearJS lmfao.
[00:39:25] <dminkovsky> what could it be
[00:39:36] <dminkovsky> JS doesn't need anything
[00:39:57] <dminkovsky> it got BigInt and UInt8 so it's all set
[00:42:10] <dminkovsky> waiting for someone to say "threads"
[00:43:48] <ngoldbaum> gerikson: see main channel no new mod
[00:43:59] <imode> no client side code apart from rendering. no documents, but a direct TCP-like connection sending live draw commands, assets to invoke with those commands.
[00:44:13] <imode> basically do away with JS and make everybody's stuff a smart dumb terminal.
[00:45:14] <dminkovsky> that must exist

[00:46:59] <ngoldbaum> it was brett for a while
[00:46:59] <dminkovsky> drakonis: it is now, but it was brett before
[00:47:05] <drakonis> i see lmao
[00:50:00] <imode> dminkovsky: it probably does exist via some WebSocket connection.

[00:52:11] <imode> well, part of it is.
[00:52:23] <dminkovsky> i figured i'm just being a bitch
[00:52:34] <imode> just that it wouldn't be VNC, it would be like "draw line here, fill box here, make this trigger do X here".
[00:52:42] <imode> something like that.

[01:18:15] <dminkovsky> something under-discussed is how chaotic it can be to switch branches
[01:18:37] <dminkovsky> sometimes i'll switch branches and hell will break loose
[01:18:58] <dminkovsky> i've got a couple development-only processes that watch files and rebuild stuff
[01:19:02] <dminkovsky> sometimes they go nuts
[01:19:14] <dminkovsky> sometimes a vscode plugin goes nuts
[01:19:39] <dminkovsky> sometimes it chills out after a few moments; sometimes it does not and i have to kill stuff
[01:19:53] <dminkovsky> people act like switches branches is fun and easy but it's not
[01:19:56] <dminkovsky> switching*
[01:20:11] <dminkovsky> similarly rebasing
[01:20:31] <dminkovsky> sometimes causes things that watch directories to lose it
[01:20:45] <dminkovsky> software development is a careful dance
[01:22:33] <dminkovsky> maybe i just shouldn't use these tools but, i dunno, i like things that watch and do stuff

[01:51:29] <dminkovsky> are these people anarchists or communists when it comes to software
[01:51:41] <imode> gerikson: what channel?
[01:51:44] <dminkovsky> should proprietary software be nationalized, or should the ownership just be removed

[01:55:39] <dminkovsky> i know
[01:58:46] <gerikson> 23:26 <bill-auger> that is mostly true today - thats why one should firstly ask: "is this really an important computing task, or is it a frivilous convenience/luxury"

[02:12:39] <dminkovsky> these are just basic communists
[02:12:53] <dminkovsky> "selfish" is the giveaway
[02:13:34] <gerikson> dminkovsky: "to protect the user, we had to make their computing life miserable"
[02:15:28] <dminkovsky> much like the glorious CCCP of yore

[05:33:09] <imode> cool. youtube's removing dislikes.
[05:33:34] <imode> it's almost like including a signal that says "don't watch me" is damaging to the idea of a platform that makes its money on people watching things.
[05:33:50] <imode> fuck google and fuck youtube.
[05:33:54] <dminkovsky> smh
[05:34:03] <dminkovsky> wasn't it enough to hide the dislike
[05:34:05] <dminkovsky> count
[05:34:45] <dminkovsky> culture in general seems totally averse to any form of negativity
[05:34:51] <dminkovsky> but somethings in life, are, like, bad
[05:35:12] <imode> yeah. but bad things are antithetical to business.
[05:35:13] <dminkovsky> or, sometimes we feel like they are. isn't that okay?
[05:35:20] <prussian> Just use the ratio of views to likes.
[05:35:31] <prussian> I'm sure you could extrapolate some dislike
[05:35:42] <dminkovsky> sure but that sucks
[05:35:51] <dminkovsky> i wonder how they rationalized it publically
[05:35:57] <prussian> I don't know.
[05:36:23] <prussian> It's basically as imode says
[05:36:38] <prussian> Just like when Netflix removed the viewer ratings lmao
[05:37:08] <dminkovsky> netshits
[05:37:21] <companion_cube> steam still has dislikes I think
[05:37:25] <prussian> I merely mooch these things
[05:37:26] <imode> it does.
[05:37:28] <imode> and it's useful.
[05:37:42] <imode> valve has some shimmer of ethics.
[05:38:05] <dminkovsky> what's interesting is that you view it from an ethics lends
[05:38:08] <dminkovsky> lens
[05:38:26] <imode> yes. you are depriving people of a reliable signal and a way of saying "no, this sucks".
[05:38:29] <dminkovsky> i see that, but i wouldn't have thought about it that way
[05:38:29] <companion_cube> even though there's some brigading on reviews, too
[05:38:37] <companion_cube> eg on wolfenstein iirc
[05:38:43] <companion_cube> because "killing nazis bad" (!??!)
[05:38:54] <dminkovsky> yeah i imagine brigading is a big and potentially legit justifier
[05:38:58] <imode> the exception should not be the rule.
[05:39:11] <imode> rather, the thing to deal with the exception should not manifest into a rule. brigading is obvious.
[05:39:14] <dminkovsky> it's also probably easy enough to clean up
[05:39:25] <imode> yeah.
[05:39:32] <dminkovsky> so it's just for business you think?
[05:39:35] <dminkovsky> and not the vibe?
[05:39:41] <companion_cube> but then, *censorship* !!
[05:39:42] <imode> yep.
[05:39:48] <dminkovsky> i mean that's business, too, obviously
[05:39:55] <imode> just the business.
[05:40:07] <dminkovsky> but i wouldn't have thought they were trying to remove a signal so much as they were trying to improve the vibe
[05:40:15] <dminkovsky> but i guess that's naive of me
[05:40:57] <imode> youtube never tries to improve the vibe. google always operates in the interests of its core metrics: ad viewership.
[05:40:58] <dminkovsky> companion_cube: i mean yeah sometimes brigading does seem legit to me; but maybe that's just when i agree with the brigadiers :)
[05:41:16] <companion_cube> yeah, well
[05:41:21] <companion_cube> I don't think it's an easy problem
[05:41:29] <dminkovsky> yeah
[05:42:02] <imode> it is always beneficial to add feedback-giving mechanisms. it is most always negative to remove those mechanisms after they have been established.
[05:42:28] <dminkovsky> google sucks
[05:43:55] <dminkovsky> “Reporters characterized Google cofounder Sergey Brin as “joking” and “dismissive.” When asked about the ruling during a Q&A at a prominent tech conference, he said, “I wish we could just forget the ruling.”93”

[17:21:55] <gwozniak> But it was nice to visit my dad for a day. And I got to see Lake Louise, which was gorgeous
[17:22:11] <gwozniak> Even though it added some time to the drive
[17:22:46] <martian67> why drive so far anyways? why not fly?
[17:23:26] <gwozniak> I was delivering a car to my dad
[17:23:30] <martian67> ah makes sense
[17:23:40] <martian67> well at least you know it runs now :)
[17:23:52] <gwozniak> 4150km later :)
[17:24:13] <martian67> that is quite a drive jesus, you must have basicly went across all of usa+canada
[17:24:27] <gwozniak> I think it was fine to do once. I wouldn't go out of my way to do it again in such a short period of time
[17:24:50] <gwozniak> Almost half the drive was getting out of Ontario

[18:27:41] <buttsbot> Twatter - TheIdOfAlan - I'm "still afraid to use spaces in file names" years old
[18:27:47] <jlindgren> I'm not actually sure I've related to something more
[18:31:55] <blissful> big mood
[18:33:28] <mouseghost> so im really confused as to if i am autistic or not uhhh. so many conflicting info
[18:35:22] <gerikson> mouseghost: you probably need to see a specialist to determine that
[18:35:32] <mouseghost> ive had ados but it came negative
[18:35:46] <mouseghost> psychiatrist says "it might be false negative"
[18:35:53] <mouseghost> diagnostic criteria kinda fit
[18:35:58] <mouseghost> aq fits
[18:36:05] <gerikson> is ados a diagnostic proceudre?
[18:36:12] <mouseghost> yep
[18:36:46] <mouseghost> autism diagnostic observation schedule
[18:38:35] <gerikson> does it matter?
[18:40:25] <mouseghost> i dont know
[18:40:35] <mouseghost> i just want to know why is it like it is
[18:40:37] <mouseghost> with everything
[18:40:41] <mouseghost> and thatd explain things
[18:40:44] <mouseghost> but if that is not that..
[18:43:05] <dminkovsky> mouseghost: why it is like what
[18:43:40] <mouseghost> dminkovsky, no friends irl to meet with. always alone, etc
[18:45:13] <dminkovsky> are those indicators of ASD?
[18:47:16] <jlindgren> mouseghost: has it gotten worse since the pandemic?
[18:47:40] <mouseghost> dminkovsky, ive been told so. i mean, i want to have friends, but cannot manage.
[18:47:58] <mouseghost> jlindgren, my overall state has. but not this thing, no. it has always been like that. like a constant.
[18:49:37] <dminkovsky> mouseghost: so you've never had IRL friends or a friend?
[18:49:45] <dminkovsky> you're 18? do you have lots of ppl around you?
[18:49:54] <mouseghost> im 18. i go to school etc...
[18:50:07] <mouseghost> i think it depends on a definition of a friend
[18:50:18] <mouseghost> but if it implies frequent irl interaction, then no
[18:51:08] <dminkovsky> what do you mean by "but cannot manage"
[18:52:22] <dminkovsky> like, the interactions are stressful?
[18:52:57] <jlindgren> ^ if that is the case - i think that is part of being introverted. I am the same way - I can only hang out with people so much before I want to retreat to my cave and wait 6 months before seeing someone again.
[18:52:59] <dminkovsky> the best friends i've had, it's not been too hard to manage. but those people are generally really few and far between
[18:54:00] <dminkovsky> jlindgren: but do you simultaneously /want/ to have friends?
[18:54:30] <jlindgren> yep - but hanging out in person is just exhausting. i can handle texting fine, and occasionally hanging out, but not consistent like every day/multiple times a week
[19:13:35] <mouseghost> dminkovsky, i mean, that im unable to make and keep friendships, and have absolutely no idea how do people have friends and why i dont
[19:14:20] <mouseghost> i want to go out and approach others, but they just dont want to interact with me, it seems
[19:24:06] <dminkovsky> yeah it's sort of a strange thing
[19:24:24] <dminkovsky> the one or two most "real" friends i have i made as a young child and i don't really remember how that happened
[19:24:58] <jlindgren> big same. it just happened and kinda stuck. all the friends i made in college faded away quickly after.
[19:25:00] <dminkovsky> friends i've made when i was older, it was definitely more of a transactional thing; not totally, but still more on that spectrum than when i was like 6 or 7 years old or something
[19:25:27] <dminkovsky> yeah i have a few college friends i'm still close with but oddly that kind of came and went for me
[19:25:41] <mouseghost> at least it came hm
[19:27:34] <jlindgren> are you in college mouseghost or still high school?
[19:27:40] <mouseghost> still high school
[19:28:19] <mouseghost> its not about some kind of permamence. im just looking at daily life, and not being able to hang out with anyone
[19:28:30] <mouseghost> i dont need like lifelong friends rn
[19:30:18] <dminkovsky> and you want to, for some reason?
[19:30:29] <dminkovsky> like, you feel like it's missing?
[19:31:09] * ngoldbaum thinks about finally playing skyrim
[19:32:16] <dminkovsky> what's different about IRC than IRL?
[19:32:31] <dminkovsky> irc is definitely easier to just, "walk into a room" and start typing
[19:32:34] <dminkovsky> and you don't see ppl's faces
[19:34:02] <mouseghost> dminkovsky, yep. i want to, for some reason
[19:34:16] <mouseghost> chatting doesnt fully satisfy me .w. i want to have uhh some more interaction
[19:34:35] <indigo> Crustaceans video club gogogo
[19:35:04] <dminkovsky> at your school are there groups that have similar interests?
[19:35:59] <ngoldbaum> https://twitter.com/griph/status/1458507940713861125
[19:35:59] <buttsbot> Twatter - griph - squinted for a solid 30 seconds at the phrase “soy bisexual” trying to figure out what this latest insult meant until I went a li...
[19:36:45] <mouseghost> dminkovsky, i doubt. some individuals also program. but one guy already shown that he prefers to hang out with other people
[19:37:43] <dminkovsky> yeah i was just asking but in my experience the people i'm most friends with haven't actually shared my particular interests
[19:38:03] <dminkovsky> just thouht maybe if you have similar interests it would be easier to start interacting cause you have something in common
[19:38:07] <dminkovsky> sorry if this is annoying
[19:38:25] <dminkovsky> getting/having friends is weird
[19:40:37] <jlindgren> true that
[19:40:53] <jlindgren> crustaceans jitsi meet + greet when
[19:41:14] <dminkovsky> ugh that would exhaust me :)
[19:42:25] <indigo> Gotta check my meeting schedule
[19:43:21] <jlindgren> same. it took me forever to get used to them when i transitioned full remote like 4yrs ago - but now its ok, but if they're longer than 30m-1h i might have to take a nap after lol
[19:43:40] <indigo> Yes, no VC longer than an hour please
[19:43:54] <dminkovsky> lol hour soooo lonnngggg
[19:44:10] <dminkovsky> i'd sit in a beer garden for hours day and day
[19:44:15] <dminkovsky> but no video conf please
[19:44:21] <dminkovsky> day after day
[19:44:45] <dminkovsky> or play some kind of sports ball or any activity really. but VC feels like death to me
[19:44:55] <dminkovsky> you guys serious? :)
[19:45:17] <indigo> It’s ok Dima, we’ll send you a recording via the Pony Express
[19:45:28] <dminkovsky> Pony doesn't do video unfortunately
[19:45:30] <dminkovsky> you'd have to send a link
[19:48:04] <indigo> dminkovsky: how do you deal with everyone calling you on your birthday? ;-)
[19:48:34] <ngoldbaum> no one calls me on my birthday
[19:48:45] <ngoldbaum> but i also hate birthdays and am happy no one calls me
[19:48:49] <dminkovsky> indigo: well, by ignoring all my of friendships i've managed to get that down to like 1 person plus my 80 year old uncle
[19:49:33] <dminkovsky> i do miss how all my old now-deceased russian relatives used to the semi-formulaic happy birthday wish speaches
[19:49:36] <dminkovsky> speeches
[19:49:48] <dminkovsky> if you're familiar with that genre
[19:49:58] <dminkovsky> to do*
[19:49:58] <indigo> Oh I am so familiar
[19:50:21] <indigo> I still do the same with my family, otherwise they get very upset
[19:50:33] <dminkovsky> indigo: you're capable of executing one of those?!
[19:50:39] <dminkovsky> that's impressive.
[19:50:57] <indigo> Like… maybe 10% of one. But it counts for them :)
[19:51:09] <dminkovsky> 10% is not bad.
[19:51:41] <indigo> ngoldbaum: it’s a cultural thing. Russians call each other on their birthdays and do speeches
[19:52:13] <dminkovsky> здоровье и счастье
[19:52:24] <indigo> Always!! 😅😂
[19:52:25] <ngoldbaum> my grandfather disowned me as a teenager because he sent me a gift once and i didn’t write him a thank-you note
[19:52:28] <dminkovsky> и... и... и... и
[19:52:31] <dminkovsky> lol
[19:52:39] <ngoldbaum> no one told me it was so damn important
[19:52:49] <ngoldbaum> but also he was always kind of a grouchy jerk
[19:52:54] <dminkovsky> if only someone would resurrect my grandmother just so she could leave me one of those voicemails
[19:52:57] <dminkovsky> lol
[19:53:07] <indigo> Awww I’m sorry Dima :(
[19:53:12] <dminkovsky> it's okay <3
[19:53:48] <indigo> ngoldbaum: my dad got pissed at me once because my Amazon gift card order didn’t go through. Except my family is very passive aggressive, so he told my sister, who told me
[19:54:31] <indigo> And then he wouldn’t believe me when I called him, he thought I forgot his bday and was lying
[19:55:16] <jlindgren> wowowow thats comical
[19:55:35] <indigo> I’m so glad I met my wife; I thought all this behavior was normal from your family until her
[19:55:48] <ngoldbaum> lol yes
[19:56:41] <ngoldbaum> at least we can try to not pass on our trauma to the next generation like they did
[19:56:51] <indigo> My mom recently went to Russia and shipped us some gifts. A paper calendar that was rolled up in a tube and partially destroyed by the process, and a ugly frilly scarf. No card, no note, nothing
[19:57:02] <ngoldbaum> although i guess kids now have plenty of their own to deal with, so glad i’m not in school right now
[19:57:22] <indigo> Apparently sending a gift without a card is not normal, I only learned to send gifts with cards from my wife
[19:57:25] <dminkovsky> "I thought all this behavior was normal" | 100% the same
[19:57:30] <indigo> +1 breaking the trauma cycle
[19:58:12] <dminkovsky> my mom likes to pretend that she just has a "hot mediterranean personality" or something like that whereas in reality she's crazy
[19:58:19] <dminkovsky> "i'm FEELING"
[19:58:20] <dminkovsky> lol
[19:58:25] <dminkovsky> no, you're crazy, it turns out
[19:58:55] <dminkovsky> (ps. she's not mediterranean)
[19:59:23] <indigo> Woof
[19:59:30] <dminkovsky> my wife's family, though with its own peculiarities, is really like, reserved and chill
[20:00:10] <dminkovsky> meh it's okay, it's been a learning process!
[20:00:34] <dminkovsky> "+1 breaking the trauma cycle" is what it's about
[20:00:49] <indigo> My wife’s family is nuts; her parents stopped talking to her for four months recently
[20:01:22] <indigo> Then they gaslit her by sending her a card that said “our door is always open”
[20:01:34] <indigo> Ahhh people :)
[20:02:50] <jlindgren> families: the most normal thing out there
[20:03:26] <jlindgren> can relate to everything here - my family is good about resolving conflicts, the wifes? nope. lots of them haven't talked in years and think the ${other_party} is at fault
[20:04:39] <ngoldbaum> gerikson: yeah i’d stop reading the foundation series now if i were you, it doesn’t get any better from there; otoh if you’re looking fir good sci-fi the last expanse book drops in like three weeks
[20:06:55] <ngoldbaum> rather than keep his asshole wife who abused me and my brother when we were kids out of my nephew’s life, my dad has decided to cease all contact with both of us since 2015
[20:07:16] <indigo> Ugh that’s really shitty
[20:07:29] <ngoldbaum> it was so important to him that he bring his wife with him that he’s ok with not being in his grandson’s life
[20:07:35] <ngoldbaum> i don’t understand that
[20:12:46] <imode> people are selfish and will act selfishly.
[20:13:38] <indigo> He chose his wife over his grandson, and that is shitty, but those are his priorities :(
