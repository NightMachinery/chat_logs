[11:05:46] <serafeim> is there a way to see which deps have newer versions ?
[11:07:48] <andrhua> serafeim: https://hexdocs.pm/hex/Mix.Tasks.Hex.Outdated.html
[11:08:19] <serafeim> nice thanks
[11:08:34] <Nicd> mix deps.update will respect your mix.exs version restrictions
[11:09:05] <serafeim> Nicd: so if i've got phoenix ~> 1.5.0 i'll need to change that to 1.6.0 to really update
[11:09:19] <Nicd> yes if you want 1.6.x
[11:09:25] <serafeim> cool thanks
[11:10:03] <serafeim> however if i've got ~> 1.6.0 and my running phoenix is 1.6.3 it will update it to 1.6.6 when i run mix deps.update --all ?
[11:11:08] <Nicd> yes
[11:11:31] <Nicd> ~> basically means "you can update the last specified number"

[11:19:58] <serafeim> ok it was fixed after i recompiled

[12:13:34] <serafeim> so it's empty anyway
[12:13:59] <serafeim> could this be realted to the elixir version ?
[12:14:17] <andrhua> I just checked MIME is indeed not a application, just a module
[12:15:36] <andrhua> find the place where it's started and comment it out
[12:16:36] <serafeim> andrhua: this isn't on my app 
[12:17:13] <andrhua> it's probably upstream dependency of those you use
[12:17:35] <andrhua> ok so it seems like 1.* versions were otp apps and 2.0 are not
[12:17:51] <andrhua> perhaps updating broke it :)
[12:18:05] <serafeim> the full error is this one: https://dpaste.com/AUV8R3KWP
[12:18:50] <serafeim> it is thrown by the phoenix_live_dashboard
[12:19:32] <serafeim> this seems to be the problem: https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix_live_dashboard/commit/7f0346fd6e6add251fe1d6cb6615351fa5fd37e2
[12:19:33] <Nicd> what's your mime version?
[12:20:16] <serafeim> this one `remote:   mime 2.0.2`
[12:20:56] <Nicd> did mime compiile before phoenix_live_dashboard?
[12:21:10] <serafeim> no
[12:21:15] <serafeim> i'm not even sure
[12:21:20] <Nicd> check the log
[12:21:26] <serafeim> however if i add a `{:mime, "~> 1.6", override: true},` on my deps will it work ?
[12:21:35] <Nicd> I cannot say
[12:21:46] <serafeim> yes mime compiled before the phoenix_live_dashboard
[12:23:33] <serafeim> i'll try with setting mime 1.6 override: true
[12:23:47] <serafeim> however i don't like that i've lost like 1 hour with this thing
[12:23:47] <Nicd> looks like there is no such module: https://github.com/elixir-plug/mime/blob/v2.0.2/lib/mime.ex
[12:23:59] <serafeim> wtf
[12:24:46] <Nicd> in 1.6 there was: https://github.com/elixir-plug/mime/blob/v1.6.0/lib/mime/application.ex
[12:25:17] <serafeim> crazy stuff
[12:25:51] <serafeim> i tried this now `remote:   mime 2.0.2 => 1.6.0 (major)` 
[12:26:14] <Nicd> I think you could file an issue on phoenix_live_dashboard

[15:53:07] <serafeim> i am trying to connect to a heroku db from my local dev env (using phoenix). it doesn't work. any idea ?
[16:05:30] <josevalim> benwilson512: hey, good morning! I need a quick abinsthe help. our graphql client does a bunch of `association { id }` lookups, where we look only for the id
[16:05:54] *** Joins: antranigv (~antranigv@37.252.78.252)
[16:06:42] <josevalim> however, that is bringing the whole association struct, when we only need the IDs. this is problematic because there is a lot of data and we only need the ids. if we could use `select: map(p, [:id])`, then it would only return a single map with a single value. do you have any suggestion on how to tackle this? could we look up some public metadata to detect it is only an id being looked up?

[16:17:04] <wink> serafeim: at some unspecified time in the past I thought heroku needed a special format for jdbc, maybe there's another quirk here. only thing I remember to maybe double check
[16:17:05] <benwilson512> josevalim: yeah you have roughly two options
[16:17:26] <benwilson512> the quasi-generalized solution is to use the project/2 function in the `association` resolver to see what fields below you are being requested
[16:17:39] <serafeim> wink: i'm copying over from their DATABASE_URL
[16:17:48] <wink> k :/
[16:19:24] <josevalim> benwilson512: will data loader be happy if I simply return a map or does it generally want a struct?
[16:19:42] <benwilson512> dataloader doesn't care about the return value actually
[16:19:50] <benwilson512> it can be anything
[16:21:11] <benwilson512> josevalim: happy to sync with you on it
[16:21:39] <josevalim> thanks, i pass the info along and let you know!
[16:21:44] <josevalim> btw, what is option number 2?
[16:23:27] <benwilson512> option 2 is do a `project/2` in your association and special case if the only field asked for is `id`
[16:23:36] <benwilson512> and in that case look at the parent and pull its `foo_id` column value
[16:23:47] <benwilson512> and return `{:ok, %{id: parent.foo_id}}`
[16:24:01] <benwilson512> avoids the DB query entirely
[16:24:19] <benwilson512> won't help if you want `association { id name }` to load only those columns

[23:00:25] <hoppity> Hi guys, is it possible to query based on a (for lack of a better word) third degree association?
[23:00:56] <hoppity> For example, let's say I have CITIES that contain HOMES that contain FAMILIES that contain PERSONS
[23:01:10] <hoppity> How in Ecto can I say give me all the PERSONS from CITY X
[23:05:22] <hoppity> Is it a matter of simply adding preload over preload until you can say "where: city == x" ?

[23:25:36] <Poeticode> Can also do it the old-fashioned way of "from(p in Person, join: f in Family, on: p.id == f.person_id" or however the associations are laid out
