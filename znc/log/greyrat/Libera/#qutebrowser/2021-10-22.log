[02:24:31] <sudoforge> isene: that's because atlassian is a failure of a tech company

[02:25:21] <isene> sudoforge: Well, that doesn't help me reach that Confluence site
[02:25:34] <sudoforge> isene: try this -
[02:25:36] <sudoforge> 'Mozilla/5.0 ({os_info}) AppleWebKit/{webkit_version} (KHTML, like Gecko) {qt_key}/{qt_version} {upstream_browser_key}/{upstream_browser_version} Safari/{webkit_version}'
[02:26:56] <isene> sudoforge: Nope. No go :-/
[02:27:50] <sudoforge> are you using webkit? or qtwebengine?
[02:29:11] <isene> sudoforge: QtWebEngine/5.12.8 
[02:31:36] <sudoforge> isene: just for jollies, try what mine resolves to:
[02:31:38] <sudoforge> Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) QtWebEngine/5.15.2 Chrome/87.0.4280.144 Safari/537.36
[02:33:27] <sudoforge> if that works, set yours to the default and find out what it resolves to and post it here
[02:35:04] <isene> Not even that. Nothing works. They must be doing some other stuff to check what browser is running?
[02:36:12] <sudoforge> this is confluence cloud?
[02:40:37] <isene> Yes
[02:43:52] <sudoforge> can you get to something public, like confluence.atlassian.com?
[02:45:04] <isene> Yup. No problem there
[02:47:26] <isene> I'll defer the debugging till tomorrow. Need to get some sleep. Thanks for the help so far. Now I at least know that changing the UA does nothing to fix the issue.
[02:49:10] <sudoforge> yeah, could be your workspace
[02:49:23] <sudoforge> i'd involve your IT group or whoever manages the workspace tomorrow
[02:49:50] <sudoforge> give them your default UA and go from there
[02:51:54] <isene> Tried something interesting: Firefox works without a hitch, so I tried to set the UA in qb to what my Firefox reports (Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux x86_64; rv:93.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/93.0) - but still no go in qb. So - they are for sure doing something else to deduce what broser is running - other than simply reading the UA. Fuckers.

[12:42:18] <isene> Since it works in Firefox and is unrelated to the UA string, Atlassian must be doing some other inspection to figure out the browser (which I consider slightly evil - because if the rendering is good or bad in qb should be my concern and not blocked by them)

[12:47:39] <The-Compiler> isene: no idea
[12:47:53] <The-Compiler> isene: you might want to try with QtWebEngine 5.15, e.g. via a virtualenv install
[12:48:43] <The-Compiler> isene: also, if they really notice some essential feature is missing in the browser, this seems fine to me, rather than showing a appearing-to-be-working-but-broken website (and also much better than looking at the UA)
[12:49:39] <The-Compiler> isene: https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTBUG-92971 re GetKeyboardLayoutMap
[12:55:39] <isene> It would be better to show a notice of a missing feature than block the site entirely. Also - it seems they whitelist a set of browsers and I suspect they have no clue what is working or not in qb (also - the site worked perfectly only two days ago and I see no difference in functionality when I fire up Firefox on the same site today)
[12:57:11] <isene> So - I should just use FF for now until Ubuntu gets out a new version with that bug fixed, I suppose.

[13:14:13] <The-Compiler> no need to

[13:19:23] <The-Compiler> ok, make it 2 then (or 3, if you need to clone the git repo first)
[13:19:47] <isene> And then install 1/2 Gig worth of software...
[13:20:16] <The-Compiler> use --no-install-recommends, as mentioned in those docs
[13:23:02] <isene> OK - tried the virtualenv qb - still the same 
[13:26:57] <The-Compiler> With --temp-basedir, and it shows QtWebEngine 5.15 in :version?
[13:31:30] <isene> Ah - interesting. Now it works! Qt = 5.15.5
[13:32:35] <isene> So, knowing that it works there, I should simply wait until it comes into Ubuntu? Because dealing with all settings and cookies back and then later forth is a bit too hassle-y

[18:00:39] <sudoforge> The-Compiler: yeah, that does the trick; i was tunnel visioned and didn't think to test that
[18:02:40] <sudoforge> that's not ideal in the long term though, since it effectively stops simple searches (:open <query>). i'm wondering if we should add first-class support for host-resolver-rules
[18:03:10] <The-Compiler> sudoforge: same
[18:03:23] <sudoforge> if you agree that would be the best path forward, i'll spend some time next week working through it
[18:05:16] <The-Compiler> sudoforge: hmm, can we go back to your use-case again - is this just so you can open "go/whatever" links? I assume you don't actually need host resolution for things like images or whatever resources coming from those go links?
[18:05:34] <sudoforge> yes, it is so i can open go/foo links
[18:06:00] <sudoforge> regarding images, i.... don't know. i don't use golinks to resolve images, personally, but perhaps someone does?
[18:06:42] <The-Compiler> sudoforge: If it's just about :open, I was wondering whether we should have something like url.searchengines but allowing for regex patterns: https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser/issues/6067
[18:07:13] <The-Compiler> sudoforge: it sounds like this would be a bit less intrusive, but allow you to ":open go/whatever", as well as allowing me to ":open /r/qutebrowser" or whatever
[18:07:30] <sudoforge> hmmm
[18:08:37] <sudoforge> that's a fair idea, but i think first-class support for `--host-resolver-rules` may be a separate concern
[18:09:15] <sudoforge> it's a bit more than k/v matching like what we have for search engines (even with regex support)
[18:09:45] <The-Compiler> agreed, but I wonder if it's still generally useful then
[18:10:39] <sudoforge> the regex search engines? i'd say so
[18:10:54] *** Joins: Hund (~Hund@Linuxkompis/Founder/Hund)
[18:11:15] <Hund> The-Compiler: Have you considered using a text file for JavaScript whitelist?
[18:11:30] <sudoforge> to highlight an example, if i want "r/<foo>" to search reddit for <foo>, that's different than wanting "r" to resolve to a host
[18:11:38] <rj1> my daddy said trust no man but ya bruthaz, and never leave yo day onez in tha gutta... QUTEBROWSER RULES!
[18:11:41] <Hund> I find it rather annoying that I can't save settings for my temporary profiles.
[18:12:12] <The-Compiler> sudoforge: The regex search engines are useful, no doubt. But are the host resolver rules?
[18:12:21] <sudoforge> Hund: i think i may have missed an earlier conversation, but you can totally save the settings for your temporary profiles
[18:12:24] <The-Compiler> Hund: what do you mean?
[18:12:30] <The-Compiler> rj1: huh
[18:13:32] <sudoforge> The-Compiler: i would argue yes, absolutely -- a lot of companies use "golinks" for example. enabling the user to set up custom host resolution would simplify "native" support within qutebrowser
[18:13:51] <The-Compiler> sudoforge: but do they really need full host resolution mapping to work?
[18:13:57] <Hund> The-Compiler: I use a script that creates temporary profiles with Qutebrowser. It's nice to have for say when you want to visit a shopping website. The only issue is that I have to allow JavaScript for that website every single time.
[18:14:38] <sudoforge> The-Compiler: as opposed to what? there are a million and one golink platforms out there, and while some may be taking the url argument as a search term, others do not
[18:14:50] <Hund> sudoforge: Oh?
[18:15:23] <sudoforge> Hund: use config.py, you can endlessly extend your configs
[18:15:51] <sudoforge> eg i use a base config.py, and import that in my work profile, layering custom configuration on top of it
[18:16:20] <The-Compiler> sudoforge: What's the difference between 'MAP go go.foo.com' and a "search engine pattern" (probably needs a better name, ":open mapping" or whatever) like go/(.*) mapped to go.foo.com/\1? There are probably some subtle differences, but I'm not sure they matter.
[18:16:42] <sudoforge> you could do the same. some base config.py, and then your script passes `--config-py /path/to/some/shopping/config.py`, which imports your base and then sets custom configs
[18:16:45] <sudoforge> Hund: ^
[18:17:06] <Hund> sudoforge: Thanks. I'll look into that. :)
[18:17:28] <sudoforge> The-Compiler: in the simple case, those are functionally equivalent, but --host-resolver-rules is much more powerful than simple a:b matching
[18:18:14] <sudoforge> eg. rules support exclusion, which couldn't be accomplished by a searchengine
[18:19:45] <sudoforge> Hund: this is how i invoke alternate profiles: https://github.com/sudoforge/dotfiles/blob/trunk/sxhkd/.config/sxhkd/sxhkdrc#L47-L50
[18:20:43] <sudoforge> (i hash my profile names for privacy reasons, but you certainly don't need to do that -- and you'd want to use --temp-basedir instead of --basedir <path>)

[18:27:55] <sudoforge> and the profile-specific config.py files are pretty simple, they import my base config and then overwrite or extend it as desired (eg, in my "work profile", i add a couple more cusotm search engines)
[18:34:33] <The-Compiler> sudoforge: yeah - I'm mainly wondering if it's worth the effort to implement, given that this has comen up quite rarely
[18:37:13] <sudoforge> i would personally argue "yes" :P
[18:37:58] <sudoforge> i'll try to make some time to follow up on this next week/weekend and send a PR your way when i have something worth sharing
[18:38:02] <sudoforge> sound good?
[18:38:13] <The-Compiler> sudoforge: but would you personally use this if you had the regex searchengine thing?
[18:38:18] <sudoforge> yes
[18:38:21] <The-Compiler> sudoforge: I suppose, but note review might take a while
[18:38:33] <The-Compiler> sudoforge: can you elaborate on why?
[18:40:26] *** Joins: eremitah (~int@user/eremitah)
[18:40:28] <sudoforge> the primary reason being that it is how users of other browsers will solve this same problem, and i see first-class support as a better solution than regex searchengines
[18:41:25] <sudoforge> it gives users access to the full rule specification for host specification, which sure, most people may not take advantage of, but there are some that will (eg me)
[18:42:08] <sudoforge> er, host resolution*
[18:43:43] <sudoforge> but like i said earlier, for the simple case, a regex searchengine would do the trick
[18:44:25] <sudoforge> in this specific example, though, while some "golink" tools take `/foo` as a search term if it doesn't match anything in the store, others do not
[18:44:42] *** Quits: eremitah (~int@user/eremitah) (Client Quit)
[18:46:21] <sudoforge> "go/(.*)": "go.foo.com/{}" _would_ be functional for most people, i'd imagine
[18:48:31] <The-Compiler> sudoforge: I don't follow. What does "take as a search term" mean?
[18:53:12] <sudoforge> actually, ignore that comment
[18:53:17] <sudoforge> it doesn't make sense
[18:54:24] <sudoforge> what i was getting at is that some implementations actually set up 301 redirects whereas others search in a k/v store, but yeah, regardless of the implementation a regex searchengine would be functional _for this use case_
[18:55:48] <sudoforge> as i mentioned earlier though, extending host-resolver-rules in some way would be "ideal" in the long term, because there _are_ use cases for it (eg mapping `a` to `b` but excluding `z.a`)
[18:56:16] <sudoforge> and that couldn't be handled by a searchengine
[19:09:28] <amosbird> Do we have any process on youtube adblocking ?

[19:13:38] <sudoforge> amosbird: depends. you may find success with host blocking, but you can't do anything about embedded ads, which is what most content creators are moving towards

[19:27:18] <rj1> amosbird: i found a greasemonkey script that detects the ad div and sets playback to very fast, is a good solution for me
