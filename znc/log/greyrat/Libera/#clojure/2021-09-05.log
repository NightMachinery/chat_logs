[09:00:32] <_cb> sobel Integer/toOctalString works for the problem I'm working on in that 0123 converted to "123" works but is there a way to return the string representation of the number? ie (fn 123) return "123" and (fn 0123) returns "0123"

[15:52:01] <sandra> Right, that was the impression I got. And that wouldn't've fixed their issue if it was a zero-padding decimal numbers issue
[15:57:09] <sobel> note to self: when people seem to mean octal, they don't. those who know octal won't be asking around when the answer is a builtin converter
[15:57:18] <sobel> hindsight=20/20
[15:57:46] <ridcully_> only a fortnight ago or so a Guest asked something similar
[15:58:31] <ridcully_> i'd expect that only very few people need octal in their daily work?

[16:14:35] <sobel> it fits like a glove for expressing 3 booleans or sets of 3 booleans
[16:15:08] <sobel> and like a glove, has no room for additional digits
[16:15:27] <ridcully_> haha i totally forgot about that... but on the other hand to me this is not a "single number" but just n three bit numbers
[16:16:24] <sobel> an integer coopted for bit packing
[16:19:09] <sandra> It's somewhat on the guest because if they ahd stayed longer someone woulda seen it and got it. I showed up just too lateðŸ’”
[16:36:32] <sobel> guests leaving within 10 minutes of asking a question on a full-but-sleeping channel is classic
[16:38:37] <sobel> looking back, it seems that _cb didn't realize that 0123 was an octal literal
[17:04:10] <sandra> We won't know for sure, I guess
