Using "-keyint_min 100 -g 100" still produce shorter GOPs for certain input files... If I add "-sc_threshold 0" seems to fix the problem. Is it the correct way to do it?

[08:53:03] <Lebela> hello
[08:54:03] <Lebela> I have a problem with something that is video and ffmpeg related
[08:54:12] <Lebela> so, there is this one program on Linux called "amimationmaker"
[08:54:35] <Lebela> it is a frame animation software that allowed me to create some nice text animations (e.g. intro / outro for videos)
[08:54:50] <Lebela> I exported it at 30 fps, and also in the very same size as my video
[08:55:12] <Lebela> then I used _ffmpeg_ to concatenate the videos  (my video + outro)
[08:55:17] <Lebela> and that's where things went south
[08:55:41] <Lebela> 1) When I play the concatenated video in vlc,  there is a tiny "gap" between them, which looks like "vlc" were ending the video and opening a new one
[08:55:54] <Lebela> I can see the VLC logo in between the 2 concatenated parts for a short moment
[08:56:08] <Lebela> as though the video had ended and a new video were to start
[08:56:29] <Lebela> 2) the exported video (from animationmaker) is perfect when watching it.
[08:56:48] <Lebela> But, after concatenating it in ffmpeg, the fonts gets distorted and "faulty" in the animationmaker video
[08:57:04] <Lebela> like a slug went over the place and smeared around some slime
[08:57:21] <Lebela> also the text color is _partially_ off for some letters (but ONLY after concatenating)
[08:57:26] <Lebela> I don't say that it is ffmpeg's fault
[08:57:38] <Lebela> I only say, it happens only after concatenating with ffmpeg
[09:05:14] *** Quits: Atsuko (~x@94.242.250.86) (Remote host closed the connection)
[09:05:41] <yuu[m]> <kepstin> "i'm not sure what you mean; when..." <- oh i had no idea, thank you!
[09:07:07] <yuu[m]> btw, why is it that ffmpeg has issues in trimming in the actual specified time? it always off the start/end time...
[09:09:09] <yuu[m]> `ffmpeg -i input.flac -ss 00:01:00 -to 00:02:00 output.flac` actually starts at like `00:45:00`
[09:10:05] <yuu[m]>  * `ffmpeg -i input.flac -ss 00:01:00 -to 00:02:00 output.flac` actually starts at like `00:00:45`
[09:11:24] <znf> Lebela, sounds like you're encoding to poorer quality
[09:13:08] <Lebela> znf, both are 4K,  16:9 format
[09:13:18] <Lebela> znf, not sure about the codec which animationmaker uses
[09:13:49] <znf> you should also state the full command line you're using
[09:14:36] <Lebela> znf, ffmpeg -f concat -safe 0 -i videos.txt -c copy merged.mp4
[09:15:00] <Lebela> videos.txt  contains the filelist,  one file per line,  surrounded by  file '  in front and  '  in the end
[09:15:24] <Lebela> let me check the codec of the animationmaker mp4
[09:15:39] <znf> then your video is getting copied and not transcoded
[09:15:52] <znf> I fail to see how it would distort your video in any way
[09:17:51] <Lebela> I think I found something, znf
[09:17:58] <Lebela> I used "mediainfo" to find the codecs
[09:18:14] <Lebela> Codec of the actual "real life video"   >  https://dpaste.org/ki2y
[09:18:41] <Lebela> Codec of the animationmaker file:  >  https://dpaste.org/TetU/raw
[09:19:09] <Lebela> the difference is this line:
[09:19:10] <Lebela> Codec ID                                 : isom (isom/iso2/avc1/mp41)
[09:19:15] <Lebela> Codec ID                                 : mp42 (isom/mp42)
[09:20:29] <znf> can you show the output of the ffmpeg command you run?
[09:21:05] <Lebela> znf, I must re-run the command as it was part of a bigger script that ran over night
[09:21:12] <Lebela> znf, can I get 5 minutes to reproduce a test case
[09:21:15] <Lebela> ?
[09:22:16] <znf> I'm actually going to bed :)
[09:22:37] <znf> but still get the output of the command for when someone else will be available

[09:23:32] <Lebela> half a minute
[09:23:35] <Lebela> I am almost done
[09:25:51] <Lebela> znf, https://dpaste.org/LdvL/raw
[09:28:32] <znf> it's a stream copy, so there should be no difference
[09:30:24] <Lebela> I wonder about the different codecs
[09:30:33] <Lebela> I am going to re-encode the animationmaker's file
[09:30:35] <Lebela> ffmpeg -i animationmaker.mp4 -c:v libx264 -an -preset veryslow -crf 0 repaired.mp4
[09:31:35] <znf> if the codecs would differ a lot (which they don't), you couldn't concat
[09:32:15] <Lebela> I have no other idea
[09:32:20] <znf> mp42 vs isom is, for what I remember, just a difference in the /containers/
[09:32:37] <Lebela> the video looks good when I open the mp4 exported by animationmaker
[09:32:44] <Lebela> things only get ugly after concatenating with ffmpeg
[09:32:59] <Lebela> the letters look totally distorted and decolorized and there is this 2 seconds reloading gap
[09:33:19] <Lebela> Do you by any change know,  how I can add "-movflags +faststart"  to concatenate?
[09:33:30] <Lebela> because all my files use  "-movflags +faststart"  but not the final output after concat
[09:34:08] <znf> I don't think that matters in any way, have you tried concatenating to a different container? (ie: MKV)
[09:34:24] <znf> sorry, I kinda need to go, it's getting late (well, early) :)
[09:34:30] <Lebela> no, I haven't tried mkv yet
[09:34:35] <Lebela> sorry for having kept you from bed
[09:34:39] <Lebela> znf, I appreciate the chat
[09:34:40] <Lebela> thank you!

[13:49:35] <Lebela> hi
[13:49:52] <Lebela> I am running 2 very simple ffmpeg commands, but there is a problem
[13:49:57] <Lebela> ffmpeg -i in.mp4 -r 30 %03d.bmp
[13:49:57] <Lebela> ffmpeg -framerate 30 -pattern_type glob -i "*.bmp" -c:v libx264 -pix_fmt yuv420p out.mp4
[13:50:12] <Lebela> I compared the frames frame-by-frame in both videos.
[13:50:25] <Lebela> the frames in "in.mp4"  differ massively from the frames in "out.mp4"
[13:50:47] <Lebela> many animations get "eaten" because many frames get repeated while others don't get shown in "out.mp4"
[13:50:56] <Lebela> how can I make "out.mp4" look exactly like "in.mp4" ?

[17:26:36] <Lebela> re
[17:26:41] <Lebela> furq, are you around by any chance?
[17:27:05] <Lebela> I have tried to solve something for the past ~20 hours but I am exhausted beyond believe
[17:27:36] <Lebela> the problem (concatenating) sounds so easy to solve, yet it is so messed up
[17:27:49] <Lebela> I tried a lot of different routes but none worked.
[17:28:01] <Lebela> And I have done so much research on the internet, mostly on stackoverflow
[17:28:08] <Lebela> I have really put in the work, but I need help
[17:29:27] *** porn is now known as hentai
[17:29:47] *** Joins: stevenliu (~stevenliu@ffmpeg/developer/stevenliu)
[17:29:49] <kepstin> Lebela: indeed, if the in.mp4 is not exactly 30fps, then the "-r 30" option in the first command will result in some frames getting dropped or duplicated.
[17:30:12] <Lebela> kepstin, been there, done that
[17:30:19] <Lebela> even with -framerate to avoid any dropping of frames
[17:30:29] <Lebela> also tried to extract all frames and putting them back together as mp4
[17:30:37] <Lebela> tried to use the intermediate *.ts
[17:30:55] <Lebela> tried different formats (mkv, mp4, avi)
[17:31:14] <Lebela> I tried to remove milliseconds to we have straight seconds
[17:31:17] <Lebela> tried to re-encode
[17:31:27] <Lebela> roughly 20 hours,  I am so done with life right now
[17:31:39] <Lebela> the problem is:  There is a "jump" between the files
[17:31:58] <Lebela> in "vlc" (the media player) it looks like it's closing the video but then it starts the next video
[17:32:07] <Lebela> in "mpv", there is an akward pause
[17:32:19] <Lebela> also, the video quality suffers a lot of the second video after concatenating
[17:34:02] <znf> can we see that miraculous video?
[17:34:04] <Lebela> I also changed the bitrates
[17:34:06] <znf> because you seem to still be stuck here
[17:34:16] <Lebela> znf, I am devastated beyond believe
[17:34:42] <znf> And we can not have any idea on what the video looks like and what you're experiencing :)
[17:34:56] <Lebela> znf, I can send you a sample of the _second_ video  (the bad one)
[17:35:07] <Lebela> the first video, I am not allowed to forward (yet)
[17:35:23] <Lebela> but I am sure you will get the same problem when concatenating the 2nd video with any of your 4K videos
[17:35:24] <znf> what help would that be? :)
[17:35:42] <kepstin> hmm, all i can say is that the particular concatenate method i'd recommend for this situation is https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/Concatenate#filter (concat filter) since that'll handle mismatches in codecs/settings.

[17:36:02] <Lebela> znf, let me try if I can reproduce the error with a still image turned into an mp4 at 30 fps
[17:36:04] <Lebela> brb
[17:36:25] <Lebela> kepstin, been there, done that
[17:36:31] <kepstin> do both files have audio?
[17:36:35] <Lebela> no
[17:36:40] <Lebela> both are without audio
[17:36:59] <kepstin> so, what problem do you see with the concat filter method?
[17:37:00] <znf> we don't have a crystal ball, can not see the output, can not figure out what exactly you mean by "jump" or whatever :)
[17:37:12] <Lebela> znf, can I get a few moments?
[17:37:16] <Lebela> let's say 10 minutes?
[17:37:41] <Lebela> kepstin, the biggest problem is probably:
[17:37:44] <Lebela> >> Non-monotonous DTS in output stream 0:0; previous: 897005, current: 155136; changing to 897006. This may result in incorrect timestamps in the output file.
[17:38:00] <Lebela> For VLC, the problem is:
[17:38:01] <Lebela> >>  Too high level of recursion (3)
[17:38:10] <Lebela> >> Failed to create video converter
[17:38:11] <kepstin> that doesn't make sense, the concat filter shouldn't produce that method
[17:38:23] <znf> When you're giving us bits of info, it doesn't really help :)
[17:38:27] <Lebela> give me a moment I will create a sample case
[17:38:31] <kepstin> please share the exact command line and output (using a pastebin site, don't paste large text in the channel)
[17:38:37] <Lebela> I am closing the chat for 5-10 minutes
[17:38:44] <Lebela> I will come back with a working test case

[17:49:46] <Lebela> znf, do you - by any chance - have "Animationmaker" installed?  Or would you install it?  (please) ?
[17:49:53] <znf> neither
[17:50:00] <znf> and I'm also not going to go the length of creating a video
[17:50:02] <Lebela> should I send you the exported mp4 ?
[17:50:24] <Lebela> I upload the concatenated video
[17:51:15] <kepstin> we don't really want to re-create your problem unless it's really necessary - just seeing the ffmpeg command you're running to do the concat and its full output, along with a description of the playback problems would be a good start.
[17:52:38] <Lebela> https://filebin.net/kbz1ydp7h0132abq
[17:52:43] <Lebela> all files are there ^
[17:53:05] <Lebela> the video "concatenated.mp4" is the faulty video
[17:53:23] <Lebela> bad.mp4   is the video that works "standalone" but not when concatenated
[17:53:29] <kepstin> right, and please provide the command line used to make it and the terminal output from that command.
[17:53:32] <Lebela> good.mp4  is the video that works in both cases

[18:00:26] <znf> to be fair, I'm not seeing an actual issue with the video you last linked, ffplay seems to play it properly
[18:00:38] <Lebela> znf, vlc jumps badly
[18:01:11] <Lebela> znf, mpv does _not_ show the second video at all when playing the concatenated video
[18:01:15] <kepstin> Lebela: hmm. so there's no guaratee that file will be playable correctly if the two inputs were made with different encoders or settings. a jump as decoder is reinitialized could be expected indeed
[18:01:28] <kepstin> Lebela: i'd recommend using the concat filter method to avoid problems.
[18:01:56] <Lebela> kepstin, which command would work for sure in regards to the filter method you mentioned?
[18:02:26] <kepstin> i sent you a documentation link eariler, but here it is again: https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/Concatenate#filter
[18:03:00] <kepstin> note that concat filter requires re-encoding the video, so you need to set appropriate encoder options to maintain expected quality.
[18:03:16] <Lebela> I am sure I tried that already
[18:03:22] <Lebela> I re-wrote the command without the audio
[18:03:28] <Lebela> but that was roughly ~10 hours ago
[18:03:36] <Lebela> so I need to try it again to see what went wrong with it
[18:03:53] <Lebela> kepstin, can I just re-encode the "bad" video?
[18:04:03] <Lebela> kepstin, there are 40+ videos that I will concatenate
[18:04:10] <Lebela> the total size will be 200+ GB
[18:04:20] <Lebela> re-encoding would be a horror
[18:04:32] <znf> your issue is that you're trying to concatenating files with different color spaces
[18:04:35] <Lebela> can't I just make the 10 seconds outro  (the blue box) match the rest?
[18:04:49] <Lebela> znf, can I force the outro into the right color space?
[18:05:00] <znf> re-encode that one, then, to match
[18:05:06] <Lebela> I rather force the 10 seconds outro to behave rather than 200  GB of footage
[18:05:54] <Lebela> znf, could you please hook me up with a working command for my specific needs?
[18:05:59] <kepstin> note that you *can* re-encode while using the concat demuxer (like the command you posted in https://dpaste.org/2t05/raw ) by setting an encoder instead of using -c copy, which is likely to improve compatibility if you have some "not quite matching" video inputs.
[18:06:05] <Lebela> znf, you saw the videos - what exactly would I need to do?
[18:06:26] <Lebela> kepstin, yep but it's gonna take a loooooong time
[18:06:36] <Lebela> kepstin, the whole post-processing already takes 12+ hours
[18:06:46] <Lebela> kepstin, if I have to re-encode, then god be my saviour
[18:06:48] <znf> I only saw 2 videos, and I'm not sure which one is the "reference" one
[18:07:01] <Lebela> znf, "good.mp4" is the reference (for all videos)
[18:07:07] <Lebela> znf, "bad.mp4" is the outro
[18:07:20] <znf> so you need to append the "outro" for everyone?
[18:07:31] <Lebela> only once
[18:07:36] <Lebela> at the very, very end
[18:08:09] <Lebela> thank you for being there for me
[18:08:27] <Lebela> I had a really terrible night+day and I am exhausted and powerless and the fact that you are here helps me big time
[18:08:35] <znf> so let me get this straight: you have multiple videos that you want to concatenate TOGETHER, and then you want to append "bad.mp4" (which is the outro) after all of them, yes?
[18:08:44] <Lebela> I tried soooooooo many things, and this video keeps jumping and jumping
[18:08:55] <Lebela> znf, yes
[18:09:21] <znf> also, are you sure all those videos (except the outro one) are identical?
[18:09:51] <Lebela> yes, they are all from the same camera type and model
[18:10:09] <Lebela> znf, they were taken from different angles (different cameras) but all the same type / model / make
[18:10:28] <znf> that doesn't really say much :)
[18:10:38] <Lebela> don't scare me ;)
[18:10:46] <kepstin> and same settings? same camera can record at different resolutions/frame rates/etc :)
[18:10:48] <Lebela> how could the same camera model lead to different outcomes?
[18:10:54] <Lebela> same settings
[18:11:00] <Lebela> definitely same settings
[18:11:23] <znf> we don't know, the camera might decide that bt470bg is not a good fit for whatever it's filming
[18:11:26] <Lebela> I can't describe you how much this outro has depressed me tonight
[18:11:45] <kepstin> right. so concatenating video made with a software encoder to video made with a hardware encoder like in a camera is always problematic
[18:12:02] <kepstin> the hardware encoder is a black box, so you can't really match the settings properly to make a concatable video using software
[18:12:33] <kepstin> sometimes you can guess, or play around with profile settings when encoding the video to put at the end
[18:12:44] <kepstin> but sometimes you just have to re-encode the whole thing to get a clean concat :/
[18:13:10] <Lebela> What if I used a different software but animationmaker?
[18:13:16] <znf> that's not your issue
[18:13:41] <Lebela> I tried a workaround which I was _sure_ would work, but it failed, too
[18:13:49] <Lebela> I exported _every_ frame and then put it back together
[18:13:54] <kepstin> the particular thing you have to do is encode (or re-encode) your outro video with settings that match (or are a subset of) the settings that the camera's builtin video encoder used.
[18:14:02] <Lebela> but, for some reason, some frames were repeated, others dropped
[18:14:08] <kepstin> but what those settings are... who knows?
[18:14:38] *** Joins: guest (~guest@124.126.139.136)
[18:14:42] <znf> basically you need to match these at best: https://pastie.dev/wEykOC.py
[18:14:43] <kepstin> if you could share a clip direct from the camera encoder someone here with spare time (not me) might be able to play around with x264 to find settings that will result in a clean concat.
[18:14:44] <Lebela> kepstin, if you tell me what commands would tell us the settings, I can tell you
[18:14:50] <Lebela> I have the original camera's videos here
[18:14:51] <znf> but as kepstin said - it's a black box, your mileage may vary
[18:15:01] <Lebela> so I can find out all about their codec or whatever specs
[18:15:21] <znf> see the command I used there
[18:15:28] <znf> the ffprobe one
[18:15:34] <znf> that's basically your best starting point
[18:15:48] <Lebela> thank you znf
[18:15:53] <znf> it's a long shot tough
[18:15:54] <Lebela> I am running this on the "real" video
[18:16:13] <znf> better be running it on more than one segment
[18:16:22] <znf> to see if the output differs between them
[18:17:33] <Lebela> just doing so
[18:17:55] <kepstin> particular things you'll need to do when (re)encoding the outro video to do are to limit x264 using the -profile option to match the profile of the camera video, and ensure gop size and reference frame counts don't exceed the camera video encoder.
[18:20:46] <Lebela> znf, kepstin:  https://dpaste.org/BVRq/raw
[18:20:53] <Lebela> I only removed the "Creation Date"
[18:21:02] <Lebela> this is what the original files _all_ look like
[18:21:35] <kepstin> baseline profile (so using constrained baseline in libx264 is ok), no b frames, 1 reference frame.
[18:21:48] <Lebela> is that good or bad?
[18:21:51] <kepstin> iirc constrained baseline prevents b frames already
[18:22:03] <kepstin> neither, it's just settings
[18:22:18] <kepstin> cameras don't encode video very efficiently, they're designed to use little power.
[18:22:38] <kepstin> (you could make this video a lot smaller without visible quality loss using a good software encoder)
[18:22:43] <Lebela> Which settings do I need to pass into ffmpeg to resemble this?
[18:23:13] <Lebela> I see many settings but no idea what is important and what not
[18:24:44] <Lebela> I pasted the Outro's ffprobe output, too
[18:24:59] <Lebela> OUTRO >> https://dpaste.org/NxL4/raw
[18:25:18] <Lebela> Camera's videos  >>  https://dpaste.org/BVRq/raw
[18:25:30] <Lebela> maybe that helps to see it side-by-side
[18:25:31] <kepstin> hmm. that output doesn't include the gop size, i think, but that might not be important.
[18:26:14] <Lebela> there is no color_space in the outro!
[18:26:35] <kepstin> try re-encoding the outro video with "-c:v libx264 -profile baseline -level 41 -refs 1 -pix_fmt yuv420p"
[18:26:52] <Lebela> thank you
[18:27:23] <kepstin> note that the conversion from 444 to 420 will result in some colour smudging if there's sharp digital graphics with fine colour details.
[18:27:38] <kepstin> this is unavoidable, if it's a problem you need to redesign your outro graphics.
[18:29:11] <kepstin> you'll want to also add a -crf or bitrate option to that command when re-encoding the outro to set the quality ^^^
[18:29:24] <kepstin> default is, i think, crf 22 or 23? which is ok, but not great, quality.
[18:29:27] <Lebela> re-encoding worked perfectly
[18:29:31] <Lebela> but the problem is concatenating
[18:29:32] <Lebela> https://dpaste.org/rCXK/raw
[18:30:04] <Lebela> kepstin, can I go with crf 0 ?
[18:30:22] <Lebela> just to give it the best quality?  The outro is only a few seconds,  size doesn't matter here
[18:30:24] <kepstin> no, crf 0 is a special lossless mode that's incompatible with baseline profile
[18:30:39] <Lebela> what is the best I can do?   1  ?
[18:30:41] <kepstin> (around 14-16 or so is probably fine)
[18:31:01] <kepstin> the outro video is short, right? just try a few and check.
[18:31:05] <Lebela> the outro contains small text,  so legibility is of utmost imporance

[18:38:52] <Lebela> yes
[18:39:11] <kepstin> since if the file is playable, then it has a correct moov atom

[18:39:28] <Lebela> I still get the same error
[18:40:00] <Lebela> another|, my hope was that  -movflags +faststart  would move the moov atom to the front
[18:40:10] <Lebela> kepstin, why is that a waste of time?

[19:01:22] <Lebela> long story short:

[19:01:28] <Lebela> I then did this:
[19:01:35] <Lebela> ffmpeg -i NEW.mp4 -framerate 30 %04d.bmp
[19:01:41] <Lebela> and then I compared the frames.
[19:02:05] <znf> what's the original framerate of that video?
[19:02:12] <Lebela> the amount of frames was equal,  but the content differently
[19:02:15] <Lebela> 30 frames
[19:02:27] <znf> then you don't need to set an explicit -framerate
[19:02:40] <Lebela> znf:  let us say, in the animationmaker's outro, the animation was:
[19:02:44] <Lebela> 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
[19:02:56] <Lebela> then, in the newly put together video, the animation might be:

[19:21:10] <znf> not unless your main video changes
[19:21:12] <Lebela> because, re-encoding the entire video would annoy me a little bit, _but_ if the videos stopped working in the future after many views, that would be a real issue
[19:21:30] <kepstin> note that youtube for example re-encodes after upload
[19:21:38] <znf> the video won't just fail suddenly once it's already encoded
[19:21:41] <kepstin> so the format you upload is unrelated to what people actually see
[19:22:16] <Lebela> kepstin, are you sure?  I read, that if videos are uploaded according to youtube's specifications, they would NOT re-encode
[19:22:36] <kepstin> no, they always re-encode
[19:22:44] <znf> they stopped doing that ages ago (not re-encoding)
[19:22:55] <kepstin> uploaded according to specs allows them to start re-encoding as you upload, so the video is ready sooner
[19:23:14] <Lebela> how about tiktok and odysee ?
[19:23:35] <kepstin> i don't know specifics about those, but most platforms re-encode uploads
[19:23:39] <znf> tiktok most likely re-encodes
[19:23:55] <znf> keep in mind they have to convert dozens of formats when you upload something (youtube)
[19:23:57] <Lebela> odysee... I suppose not because they use the blockchain
[19:24:14] *** Quits: stevenliu (~stevenliu@ffmpeg/developer/stevenliu) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[19:24:17] <znf> they don't "use blockchain" to store video
[19:24:43] <kepstin> you can't put videos on blockchain anyways, doesn't make sense.
[19:24:44] <kepstin> so presumably they're linking to video stored on normal servers somewhere, and could do whatever with it
[19:24:47] <Lebela> znf, what makes you think so?
[19:25:04] <Lebela> afaik, odysee is decentralized
[19:25:17] <kepstin> basic knowledge about how blockchains works informs that view.
[19:25:22] <znf> that doesn't mean they use "blockchain" to store videos...
[19:25:27] <znf> blockchains are slow as hell
[19:25:34] <Lebela> https://www.zdnet.com/article/blockchain-based-odysee-keeps-your-social-media-content-online/
[19:25:41] <kepstin> it's probably ipfs or something if they say it's decentralized
[19:25:49] <Lebela> Quote from the page: "and the content remains on the blockchain permanently."
[19:26:05] <another|> kepstin: you can put arbitrary data in a blockchain. whether it's practical is a whole different can
[19:26:11] <Lebela> They use the LBRY network,  odysee is just the platform accessing it
[19:26:16] <kepstin> yeah, that's just marketing text.
[19:26:23] <kepstin> doesn't mean anything :)

[19:27:41] <kepstin> but a decentralized platform in general wouldn't have any central servers to do media encoding, so content would be "as-is" hosted by the participants
[19:27:42] <kepstin> use or not use of blockchain doesn't matter at all for that
[19:28:47] <Lebela> kepstin, I gave it a second thought.
[19:28:55] <Lebela> the original videos are huge... 200 GB easy
[19:29:01] <Lebela> but the cut videos are only 10-15 GB
[19:29:04] <kepstin> but yeah, if ffmpeg (ffplay) can play a video now, it's almost certainly going to keep being playable for the foreseeable future.

[19:30:26] <Lebela> I am trying it now
[19:30:31] <znf> Storing Video in "blockchain" would be massive; LBRY just uses peer2peer to transfer the video from your PC/Server to other viewers, it works a bit like torrents (or, well ipfs); your will be "uploaded" in some sort of way to different servers that would cache your file for a while
[19:31:02] <znf> but that doesn't mean it's gonna be permanently online, those servers will flush their caches at a point or another
[19:31:45] <znf> if you store something on IPFS right now, a small file might have a chance of surviving between multiple gateways/clients, but if it's an unpopular file and you (as the source who "uploaded" it) go offline for long periods of time, that resource is most likely gone

[19:34:31] <Lebela> nah, one audio too much
[19:34:39] <Lebela> ffmpeg -i intro.mp4 -i video.mp4 -i outro.mp4 -filter_complex "[0:v:0][1:v:0][2:v:0]concat=n=3:v=1[outv]" -map "[outv]" result.mp4
[19:35:07] <Lebela> but how will ffmpeg know which codec it should use?  And which color space?
[19:35:21] <Lebela> Does this command contain any info like "use it from video 0 or video 1 ?
[19:43:51] <kepstin> if you don't specify a codec, ffmpeg picks a default based on what output format/filename you provided
[19:43:56] <Lebela> I have read both, the wiki like documentation and the man page
[19:44:03] <kepstin> you should always specify an encoder
[19:44:25] <Lebela> both sites, man page + wiki don't show _how_ the syntax really looks like with a codec
[19:44:39] <Lebela> ffmpeg is such a powerful software, but the documentation should be better
[19:44:46] <Lebela> I would even be willing to chime in and help
[19:44:48] <kepstin> hmm? you've already done some encoding.
[19:45:02] <Lebela> kepstin, yeah but outside the "weird" filter_complex
[19:45:16] <kepstin> filter complex is just a single option on its own
[19:45:23] <kepstin> it doesn't affect the other encoding settings
[19:45:29] <znf> the documentation is really strong though
[19:45:54] <znf> ffmpeg is just not a tool that someone without some bits of knowledge about video should attempt to use for complex tasks
[19:45:57] <Lebela> I try it... brb
[19:46:24] <kepstin> the main thing to note about encoding settings is that position matters - they must be before the output filename, but after all the input options.
[19:47:02] <Lebela> ffmpeg -i intro.mp4 -i video.mp4 -i outro.mp4 -filter_complex "[0:v:0][1:v:0][2:v:0]concat=n=3:v=1,-c:v libx264 -profile:v baseline -level 41 -refs 1 -pix_fmt yuv420p -color_range tv -colorspace bt470bg -color_primaries bt470bg -movflags +faststart[outv]" -map "[outv]" result.mp4
[19:47:16] <kepstin> er, i don't know what you're doing there
[19:47:22] <kepstin> don't touch the filter_complex option
[19:47:25] <kepstin> that sets the filters
[19:47:38] <kepstin> encoding options are separate options, same as if you weren't using filter_complex
[19:47:52] <Lebela> will it then be valid for all 3 inputs?
[19:48:09] <kepstin> encoding affects the output, not the inputs
[19:48:12] <Lebela> ffmpeg -i intro.mp4 -i video.mp4 -i outro.mp4 -filter_complex "[0:v:0][1:v:0][2:v:0]concat=n=3:v=1[outv]" -map "[outv]" -c:v libx264 -profile:v baseline -level 41 -refs 1 -pix_fmt yuv420p -color_range tv -colorspace bt470bg -color_primaries bt470bg -movflags +faststart result.mp4
[19:48:39] <another|> znf: eh! documentation is... varied
[19:48:46] <kepstin> Lebela: you can remove that "-profile:v baseline -level 41 -refs 1" stuff and the colour space options
[19:48:53] <kepstin> those were only needed to try to match the camera video
[19:49:02] <znf> writing docs is hard :)
[19:49:13] <Lebela> kepstin, but how will ffmpeg then know that it should give all videos the same color profiles?
[19:49:20] <kepstin> libx264 can encode with much better efficiency without the profile/level options, and colour space is copied from input
[19:49:49] <kepstin> in this case, it'll just use the colour space from the first video because of how the concat filter works
[19:49:56] <Lebela> ffmpeg -i intro.mp4 -i video.mp4 -i outro.mp4 -filter_complex "[0:v:0][1:v:0][2:v:0]concat=n=3:v=1[outv]" -map "[outv]" -c:v libx264 -pix_fmt yuv420p -movflags +faststart result.mp4
[19:49:57] <kepstin> which should be fine here
[19:50:10] *** Quits: rv1sr (~rv1sr@user/rv1sr) ()
[19:50:36] <Lebela> kepstin, the first video is a still image for 5 seconds
[19:50:43] <Lebela> so using this would be bad
[19:50:57] <kepstin> hmm? contents of the video doesn't matter...
[19:51:26] <Lebela> you are right. sorry.
[19:51:33] <Lebela> one last question before I go to bed:
[19:52:05] <Lebela> If I were to be using the "simple" method of concatenating _without_ filter_complex:
[19:52:25] <Lebela> youtube wants me to set stuff like moveflags and keyframes
[19:52:36] <Lebela> will I need to do this again _after_ concatenating?
[19:53:00] <Lebela> currently, I set the moveflags option and the keyframes option for every cut out video chunk
[19:53:06] <Lebela> and then I concatenate them all
[19:53:08] <kepstin> you're encoding a new video, so you need to set all appropriate encoding options, which can include things like gop size (keyframe interval)
[19:53:16] <Lebela> but after concatenating, I don't do anything to the moov flag
[19:53:36] <kepstin> if you're re-encoding when concatenating, the only place those options are needed is the final concat encode
[19:53:59] <Lebela> what if I did not re-encode?
[19:54:09] <Lebela> what if I just used  file ''  in a text file and concatenated that?
[19:54:24] <Lebela> is it enough, that every single file of them has "moveflags" and keyframes?
[19:54:34] <kepstin> if you use "-c copy" then the video is copied as-is, so setting keyframe interval is ignored
[19:54:37] <Lebela> or will the moovflags be at the wrong spots then?
[19:54:46] <kepstin> the +movflags only needs to be on the final output file
[19:54:47] <Lebela> oh
[19:55:16] <Lebela> kepstin, can I do +movflags with a streamline copy concatenation without re-encoding?
[19:55:23] <kepstin> yes.
[19:55:55] <another|> that only affect container data
[19:56:01] <kepstin> the movflags stuff is concerned with muxing - i.e. how the video is stored into the output file. it doesn't matter what the video itself actually is.
[19:56:25] <Lebela> ffmpeg -f concat -safe 0 -i videos.txt -c copy -movflags +faststart yyy.mp4 -y
[19:56:28] <Lebela> is that okay?
[19:56:36] *** Joins: stevenliu (~stevenliu@ffmpeg/developer/stevenliu)
[19:56:44] <kepstin> setting -movflags +faststart is like putting a label that says what's in a box on the front of the box instead of the back, so you don't need to pull out the whole box to read the label :)

[20:05:13] <Lebela> it's fascinating, that they can handle it at all

[22:53:51] <bm> Hello. I'm trying to add an overlay to a video and even using 'veryslow' preset, the resulting file is 50% larger than the original and has noticeably lower quality. What options are there?

[22:55:05] <kepstin> for context, what is the original file format and type of content?
[22:57:47] <bm> kepstin: 480p camera recording .mp4 file
[22:59:26] <kepstin> hmm, camera files usually tend to be excessively large to start with because camera hardware encoders are very simple.
[23:00:59] <bm> kepstin: it's not an original, the has been already downscaled using "Lavf"
[23:01:39] <bm> the only commandline options I supply to ffmpeg are "-filter_complex overlay" and "preset"
[23:01:50] <kepstin> right, if it's been re-encoded already then you should be able to get similar size by re-encoding with the same settings
[23:02:58] <bm> kepstin: right? But the file ballooned from 100 MB to 150 MB just by adding an overlay
[23:03:30] <kepstin> well, depending on the content of the overlay that could have made it "harder" to encode, so require more bits for the same quality
[23:04:53] <bm> kepstin: overlay is a small static image
[23:06:28] <galad> your source file is already compressed enough that each additional compression will either be bigger or lose a lot of quality
[23:07:32] <bm> galad: I am aware of that, yes. But it is both bigger (massively bigger) and has lower quality.

[23:08:51] <kepstin> note that when using ffmpeg you should always be specifying the encoder to use
[23:09:17] <kepstin> with mp4 output you're probably getting the libx264 encoder, which is pretty good, but it's possible depending on where you got ffmpeg from it might do something different.
[23:10:45] <bm> kepstin: I'm on Ubuntu and got it from apt. Yes, seems like it's using the libx264 encoder.
