[00:20:58] <gfldex> CIAvash: did you consider to create a multi on-the-fly in PatternMatching?
[00:22:12] <melezhik> tbrowder - do you mean having easier to pronounce dsn name?
[00:22:16] <melezhik> dns
[00:31:05] <CIAvash> gfldex: no, how would it look like? and what are the benefits? error when no candidate is matched?
[00:32:13] <melezhik> I might change dns in the future, right now I am not sure I am ready to book a "permanent" dns, name, will it be difficult to change it later on raku site and meanwhile use the current one?

[06:16:16] <Xliff> There is a definite regression in precompilation.
[06:17:04] <Xliff> I am now spending more time in precompilation than I am in compiling new code with the latest changes to rakudo. This really hurts projects with large dependency chains, as you are constantly precompiling compunits -THAT WERE ALREADY PRECOMPILED- seconds ago.
[06:17:41] <Xliff> I have reported this once, and the onus was put upon me to prove the problem exists. I have no idea as to the best way to do that.
[06:18:08] <Xliff> But this is the second week I have had to cancel timings due to this bug. All that I can ask is that someone PLEASE look into this.
[06:18:25] <Xliff> It is seriously killing my drive to do things in Raku.
[06:18:52] <Xliff> Something that used to take less than 5 seconds now takes over 3 minutes

[09:05:38] <samebchase> Is it just me or are the code blocks looking weird in the Advent blog? https://raku-advent.blog/2020/12/04/day-4-parsing-clojure-namespaces-with-grammars/ 
[09:05:42] <japhb> Xliff: Where's the original issue report?
[09:05:54] <samebchase> Almost, unreadable üòê
[09:07:02] <japhb> samebchase: I don't see unreadable, but I do see a mix between code blocks that look normal-ish, and code blocks that look like they're missing half the style info
[09:07:23] <Xliff> japhB: It was reported here. Never made into an issue since it was not known how to best describe such a thing.
[09:08:39] <japhb> Xliff: Hmmm.  You said there was a regression.  When did it last work quickly, and when did it first start being slow?
[09:17:42] <samebchase> Ah, for me the font weight is so thin, I can barely read it. I'm on a recent FF btw
[09:19:28] <Xliff> japhb: Last timings were made on the 10th. By the 17th, I could not get isolated precompiles of a single compunit done in most-efficient compile order.
[09:23:22] <elcaro> I'm also on FF and agree the font weight could be heavier for me
[09:24:00] <elcaro> also font size is inconsistent... small in some, larger in others.
[09:24:05] <Xliff> japhb: Anecdotal evidence. I just precompiled a compunit. I then make changes in its DESCENDANT, try and compile it, and now I am precompiling the entire chain all over again.
[09:24:19] <Xliff> It's like I never spent 327 seconds precompiling the first one.
[09:24:54] <Xliff> At any rate, I literally just woke up for a bathroom break. I'm back to bed for another couple of hours.
[09:25:08] <japhb> Ah, sleep well then.  :-)
[09:28:56] <japhb> .tell Xliff If you can write down steps to recreate the timing difference, say between 2021.09 and 2021.10, that would probably be sufficient to start the issue.  Next up would be tracing the module precomp for both versions by exporting the environment variable setting RAKUDO_MODULE_DEBUG=1 and rerunning.  Then someone could compare what you're getting with what they are getting and start ruling out problems.
[09:28:57] <tellable6> japhb, I'll pass your message to Xliff

[09:46:08] <Xliff> japhb: That will involve p6-GtkPlus. Historically, people will slow down tracing issues when I involve any of the p6-GLib software unless it is pre-golfed. I have plenty of log acces, but NOTHING conducive to replication steps.
[09:46:10] <tellable6> hey Xliff, you have a message: https://gist.github.com/08952f482efc489b735bc0e659d95c83
[09:47:57] <Xliff> Actually, if I do write it up, you all may just have to accept a compile log to see the issue. It's perfectly illustrated there.
[09:53:05] <Xliff> *sigh* -- I think I have a reporting strategy. It will take time to test.
[09:53:15] <Xliff> So much for sleep. :/
