[02:31:25] <drakonis> which has had a similar problem at the time
[02:33:57] <gerikson> with systemd and friends we're finally seeing something a bit new coming out of Linux
[02:34:18] <gerikson> I mean it's a copy of what's already in macos and windows but hey
[02:34:22] <drakonis> there has been more things i guess
[02:34:41] <Brekkjern> Since when? :P
[02:35:10] <drakonis> nothing groundbreaking
[02:35:15] <drakonis> for osdev, that is.
[02:40:34] <Brekkjern> I honestly find Linux to be rather unoriginal. The only good things about it is that it's relatively lightweight compared to the competition, and the docs are good enough when the code is available to view.
[02:41:13] <Brekkjern> Each piece of the puzzle is relatively self contained so that also makes it much easier to wrap your head around as a concept
[02:41:20] <gerikson> yeah well, GNU/POSIX provided an ok foundation
[02:41:30] <gerikson> the internet and moore's law did the rest
[02:41:42] <Brekkjern> Well, yeah, but I was talking more ecosystem
[02:44:05] <Brekkjern> Concepts about managing fleets of endpoints/servers has existed for such a long time in the Windows world (albeit in clunky incarnations, but it's not like Chef/Puppet is any better here). The only thing Linux did better here is to have the components a bit more workable than SCCM, GPOs and other stuff in that space.
[02:44:47] <Brekkjern> The new shit is really at scale deployment of containers.
[02:45:34] <Brekkjern> Container tech isn't new, and neither is at-scale management of VMs, but the combination is
[02:46:41] <Brekkjern> And since the setup process for this stuff is so much faster than spinning up a Windows VM and provisioning it through SCCM then the "cattle, not pets" strategy is actually viable.

[14:08:26] <epilys> and dog walks
[14:08:48] <Brekkjern> If I had a dog I would probably be more happy about having to get up in the morning :P
[14:09:13] <epilys> yeah that's like 0.5% of the reasons why I got a dog :p
[14:10:14] <Brekkjern>  I want one, but I don't think it would be healthy for it to be locked up in my apartment for 10 hours at the time every day
[14:11:39] <epilys> depends on the breed
[14:11:53] <epilys> I got an italian greyhound which are basically one of the laziest dogs in the world
[14:12:31] <epilys> he still walks/does a lot but it's not like e.g. a husky which are very energetic
[14:12:37] <epilys> https://i.redd.it/bwozxqv4z7h61.png
[14:13:12] <epilys> Here's he is, smol https://i.redd.it/96qzztmfjip51.jpg and grown up https://i.redd.it/frhfciaaql281.jpg
[14:13:24] <Brekkjern> Cute :)
[14:13:39] <epilys> And smol. 5kg
[14:13:57] <Brekkjern> I kinda want a herding breed. We had a bearded collie when I was young. Was a loveable floofball.
[14:14:42] <epilys> They're great, but energetic unfortunately... and shed a ton
[14:14:57] <Brekkjern> Not if you trim their fur
[14:15:13] <epilys> I wish I had a farm or something but with a bunch of dogs and have them live happily all the time
[14:15:42] <Brekkjern> And my experience with bearded collies is that they are active, but not as restless as other breeds
[14:16:16] <Brekkjern> They don't need to "get the energy out", but they are happy to play around and be active if the opportunity presents itself
[14:16:44] <Brekkjern> And thye are just as happy to lie in the middle of the house so they know exactly where everyone is
[14:16:54] <epilys> adorable
[14:17:08] <epilys> have you had one in your family?
[14:17:21] <Brekkjern> Yeah
[14:17:39] <Brekkjern> It lived until it was 13 years old IIRC. Had it since it was 6 months I think it was.
[14:17:55] <epilys> :) haven't experienced that, you were lucky!
[14:18:10] <Brekkjern> Yeah, we were :)
[14:18:56] <Brekkjern> They are a bit nervous about being left behind though. I remember it hating being in the car with me while my mother popped into a store to get something
[14:19:12] <Brekkjern> And it would be looking out through the window every time we left.
[14:19:24] <epilys> separation anxiety, maybe?

[14:19:35] <buttsbot> Gaius Octavius Maximus, Italian Greyhound, puppy 2019
[14:19:54] <Brekkjern> It's a very social breed. Their instinct is to keep "the herd" together, and the family is the herd.
[14:20:37] <Brekkjern> They are extremely relaxed whenever everyone is together, but when she'd lose control of someone you could see her be a bit agitated.
[14:20:46] <Brekkjern> She used to do rounds through the house to check up on people :P
[14:21:17] <epilys> Aww.
[14:21:27] <epilys> Lovely
[14:22:15] <epilys> If I'm at a house with many people sleeping, my dog will sleep for me for a bit, then wake up later and go to another room to sleep with someone else, then repeat until he tours/sleeps with everyone
[14:22:23] <epilys> s/sleep for/sleep with
[14:23:25] <Brekkjern> Haha
[14:23:28] <Brekkjern> That is cute :)
[14:23:47] <Brekkjern> I always tried to get mine to sleep in the bed, but I think she thought it was too hot
[14:24:37] <epilys> Could be, but it's also a comfort thing, the dog might need to learn to sleep in the bed
[14:24:45] <Brekkjern> But I remember waking up to a sound once, and seeing two glowing eyes under my desk and hearing panting. It was the dog being scared by the thunder, and the light from the hallway reflecting in her eyes. Was terrifying :P
[14:25:43] <epilys> dogs iirc hear sounds louder than us, so you can imagine how loud that is for a dog :(
[14:25:57] <Brekkjern> Yeah. She hated fireworks too.
[14:26:24] <Brekkjern> New years eve was hell. She ran away once, and we didn't find her before the day after.
[14:27:30] <jjuran> kline: :-D
[14:27:59] <epilys> Brekkjern, :( good thing you found her. it's an understandable fear for dogs.
[14:28:10] <epilys> To avoid this when i got the puppy i gave him snacks everytime there was a thunder. My girlfriend tried playing thunder noises from youtube on her smartphone on clear weather days and he always came to me for snacks
[14:28:21] <Brekkjern> lol

[14:32:05] <epilys> "there's no bad publicity" right? /s
[14:32:13] <Brekkjern> Eh... There can be :P
[14:32:17] <jjuran> Could be Facebook
[14:32:46] <Brekkjern> Could have been FB, yeah, but it's not one of the FAANGs
[14:33:06] <Brekkjern> But I guess FAANG is outdated now that it's "Meta"
[14:33:14] <jjuran> No it's not
[14:33:49] <jjuran> It will always be Facebook
[14:33:57] <jjuran> Meta's too good for them

[14:58:54] <kline> i really like the idea but its vapourware
[14:59:15] <jjuran> Personally, I've been fixing bugs in our LLVM backend (which outputs genAsm), and started moving onto implementing small codegen optimizations (or at least depessimizations)

[17:02:30] <pja> Is it not possible for the Mill to get hold of academic funding, or is the problem that the IP grab that comes along with that too much of a bitter pill?
[17:02:50] <pja> You’d think some postdocs would be happy to take a swing at an FPGA implementation.
[17:03:01] <kline> got to be balanced, or else the patents will expire before they can bring it to market anyway
[17:03:09] <pja> Yeah.
[17:04:03] <pja> Lack of access to capital is a killer, but if your idea is going to run into the sand anyway...
[17:04:14] <kline> us patents last like 20 years, they state on the website that they had 18 patents in 2018, which is like 4-5 years ago
[17:04:40] <kline> so theyre about a quarter way through the life of those, presumably fundamental, patents already, at least
[17:04:42] <pja> If you do things right, you keep on patenting features of the implementation that you can’t actually do without as you go.

[18:39:43] <epilys> what was it in specific?
[18:39:53] <gwozniak> Some Python and C stuff
[18:40:38] <epilys> ctypes?
[18:42:35] <gwozniak> No, just some Python stuff and some C stuff, independent of each other
[18:42:48] <epilys> job offer "deadline" is tomorrow and they still haven't sent me a contract... sigh
[18:42:52] <kronk> RE: mill, that thing was, is and forever will be vaporware.
[18:43:59] <kronk> the architecture isn't exactly nontrivial. they've spent more time trying to secure patents than actually creating things.
[18:46:19] <kronk> greenarrays is ironically further ahead of the curve.

[19:05:32] <gwozniak> My employer is holding what is basically a call-in support symposium soon.  Customers are supposed to join the meeting and ask questions about C and the compiler.
[19:05:50] <gwozniak> I'm hanging out in the background to help answer questions
[19:06:08] <gwozniak> The pre-submitted questions generally have nothing to do with C or the compiler
[19:06:18] <gwozniak> So this is gonna... go well...?
[19:06:31] <Church> Oh boy
[19:06:35] <Church> Hold strong
[19:07:15] <gwozniak> I suspect it will be mostly people complaining
[19:09:20] <gwozniak> One person running the session is a good at just talking about who knows what, so maybe that will do a good job of filling time
[19:20:44] <gwozniak> The saving grace is that the questions are filtered, so the discussion probably won't go off the rails

[21:21:30] <buttsbot> Why does the C preprocessor interpret the word "linux" as the constant "1"? - Stack Overflow
[21:36:28] <gwozniak> `gcc -E -dM - </dev/null` for great justice
[21:39:05] <Geekingfrog> what am I looking at ?
[21:39:13] <Geekingfrog> bunch of #define __xxx
[21:39:24] <gwozniak> Those are all the builtin #define's
[21:39:44] <gwozniak> As in, they do not come from header files.  The compiler knows them implicitly
[21:40:20] <gwozniak> Stuff like __INT32_MAX__
[21:40:24] <Geekingfrog> Is it only a gcc thing then ? Aka, can you expect horrible things if you use them directly ?
[21:40:40] <gwozniak> You're free to use them.  clang will have them too
[21:41:17] <gwozniak> The compiler basically needs them (well, not the "linux" and "unix" ones) so that the stdlib works correctly
[21:41:34] <gwozniak> If you redefine them, it's at your peril :)
[21:42:06] <gwozniak> They also describe the target the compiler was built for

[22:01:52] <drakonis> cpu gandalf???
[22:07:49] <kronk> so I have an opportunity to switch from using Java to... any other language, I guess. motivated by a small aggression related to jackson and a certain method randomly failing.

[22:29:55] <Church> Trying to upgrade a helm chart I maintain for on-prem
[23:04:33] <gwozniak> I'm looking at some of the questions that were submitted to the help session I was in earlier.  Some people want the compiler to turn off the integer promotions
[23:05:57] <kline> lol
[23:06:00] <pja> gwozniak: C/C++ compiler?
[23:06:11] <kline> yeah bro just turn off core C behaviours
[23:06:29] <pja> Arguably promoting bool to an int is bad.
[23:06:45] <pja> I could get behind dropping that.
[23:10:40] <gwozniak> Given that it is part of the C standard, dropping it would be a problem
[23:12:01] <gwozniak> The thing is, most of the motivation for these questions/complaints is not about type safety.  It's about translation to assembly
[23:12:26] <gwozniak> The people saying these things see C as a language that should just generate assembly that they would probably write
[23:13:23] <gwozniak> They also (mistakenly) see C as a simple language
[23:22:35] <edk> it does seem very common for people to think of C as a programming language that is not an abstraction
[23:22:38] <edk> whatever that would mean
[23:23:14] <edk> i mean they're not entirely wrong. it's a very... porous... abstraction, and that's a strength as well as a weakness
