[00:44:55] <SnoopJ> TomyWork, not inside, but mod_wsgi allows Apache to hand off to the other side of the interface. WSGI is a way for a web server to say "hello application, here is an environment and a request, please process it and get back to me"

[04:20:21] <kuahara> I'm using openpyxl.  I've created a new workbook and added a few worksheets to it from main.  If I pass the workbook to a function and the function adds a new worksheet to it, how does python handle that?  Do I need to return the workbook?  Is it modified in place?  Is a new workbook created that doesn't exist outside the function?
[04:20:36] <kuahara> That question probably isn't openpyxl specific, but maybe it is.

[06:19:03] <seifeslimene> MacGyver The use of the caret for exponentiation can be traced back to ALGOL 60
[06:19:17] <seifeslimene> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caret_(computing)#:~:text=The%20use%20of%20the%20caret,in%20Knuth's%20up%2Darrow%20notation.

[06:20:23] *** Quits: TheCat (~TheCat@user/z-cat) (Ping timeout: 250 seconds)
[06:21:11] <seifeslimene> MacGyver Control characters are often rendered into a printable form known as caret notation by printing a caret (^) and then the ASCII character that has a value of the control character plus 64. Control characters generated using letter keys are thus displayed with the upper-case form of the letter. For example, ^G represents code 7, which is
[06:21:12] <seifeslimene> generated by pressing the G key when the control key is held down.

[06:22:30] *** Joins: white2 (~mahengrui@user/mahengrui1)
[06:22:30] <parsnip> i think vim uses CTRL-V for prose
[06:22:45] <parsnip> <C-v> for notation in writing commands
[06:23:01] <parsnip> and ^V to mean, "press the key in the sequence"
[06:23:22] <parsnip> but iiuc, many people have notation like ^X in their vimrc
[06:23:51] <MacGyver> parsnip: I'm not sure that's notation or literally how the actual control character is being displayed.
[06:24:35] <squirrel> MacGyver: if i had to guess, it's because the caret outside computers is used in a kind of similar fashion?
[06:25:16] <MacGyver> The "reason" for this kind of thing can end up being something like "In 1956 company ABC created a terminal that needed a way to print control characters, and they used an inverted V shape, which became a caret in the 1962 iteration which was then copied when ASCII was standardized".
[06:25:25] <MacGyver> *That's* the story I'm looking for.
[06:25:50] <MacGyver> Maybe the jargon file.
[06:26:13] <phy1729> MacGyver: if it's not there you might ask ##tty

[06:28:06] <InPhase> MacGyver: Well, ^ meant xor very early on, and 0x40 ^ 'A' is 0x01, or '@' ^ 'A'
[06:28:29] <InPhase> MacGyver: I could imagine it as a compactification chosen from that reasoning.
[06:29:12] <InPhase> MacGyver: Alternatively, maybe some early keyboard had a ^ like symbol on the control key which was used to input these values.
[06:29:37] <phy1729> Sure but the question is which IS it
[06:30:04] <MacGyver> Nothing in the jargon file it seems. I'll ask ##tty tomorrow when I'm awake.
[06:30:09] <MacGyver> Thanks :)
[06:30:28] <squirrel> why don't you like my theory? i mean we literally call it a caret don't we?
[06:30:59] <squirrel> my school teacher used those to mark places where commas and stuff should get inserted
[06:31:15] <MacGyver> squirrel: I don't quite understand what you mean by "a kind of similar fashion".
[06:31:28] <parsnip> "insert actual keypress here"

[07:51:26] <aphysically> I tried to ask at work but I kept disconnecting on web :) I will need to figure out how to get venvs working
[07:51:42] <aphysically> my work laptop (windows) policy sets PIP_TARGET
[07:51:46] <aphysically> which makes venvs not really work
[07:52:18] *** Quits: milkt (~debian@gateway/tor-sasl/milkt) (Remote host closed the connection)
[07:52:53] <mefistofeles> aphysically: cannot you just override it?
[07:53:40] <aphysically> well, it sets it because the other system policies mean nothing will work unless they're executed in a whitelisted directory that the PIP_TARGET is set to
[07:53:49] <aphysically> which is fine, that directory happens to be where I'll ch eckout stuff to and make my venvs
[07:54:36] <aphysically> but I need the PIP_TARGET globally (for example, to install virtualenv because python-native venv also blocked :D) and I need to unset it all the time every time I open a commandline manually?
[07:54:57] <aphysically> I mean I agree with you on the solution, I'm just a complete Windows noob and I don't know the equivalent of bashrc/zshrc for windows
[07:55:16] <aphysically> (so any suggestion would be appreciated)

[14:55:10] <mickey> i ran them

[14:59:30] <bjs> ?
[14:59:46] <bjs> Are you sure the KeyError is actually coming from your code and not some notebook truncation code (for example).
[14:59:56] <mickey> okay i found the issue, .value_counts()[0] gives the amount of appearances of zero, not the first count in the list
[15:00:04] <mickey> if the column has no zeroes, it errors

[15:00:26] <bjs> no?
[15:00:47] <mickey> bjs apparently it did as well but i didn't see it because the notebook was truncating the output
[15:00:58] <mickey> it just did a bunch of columns first so the output seemed legit

[19:20:43] <grym> Helmholtz: i've seen this done most commonly by having your users pass auth/cookies that you then bake into the headers, and when that fails, make the user regen and resubmit
[19:21:21] <grym> in a happy world, that website will offer auth tokens or API keys or something better suited towards programmatic use, but, well
[19:21:33] <Helmholtz> grym, How should I fetch auth/cookies programatically?

[19:21:51] <grym> and then passes them in to your CLI

[19:22:00] <SnoopJ> Payam, it means the function has an empty body, you get the same effect from `def f(x,y,z): 42`, the `...` is just a convenient object to use

[22:01:47] <SnoopJ> duszek, okay, it looks like the first part of the program builds `x` as a list of integers, but the second part of the program expects it to be something else.
[22:02:18] <SnoopJ> duszek, does changing Line 53 to `digits.append(str(x[i])[j])` and Line 55 to `if str(y[i])[j] not in digits:` make the program do what you expected?
[22:02:35] <SnoopJ> (i.e. turn the ith value into a string, then index the string)
[22:03:14] <duszek> SnoopJ: yeah, it works
[22:03:18] <SnoopJ> duszek, do you understand why?
[22:03:32] <duszek> SnoopJ: explain me plz
[22:03:50] <SnoopJ> duszek, the second part of your program expects your data to be a list of strings, but your actual data is a list of integers.
[22:04:12] <duszek> i didn't knew i fed it a list of integers, thanks you

[22:05:26] <duszek> but why it is possible to have another slice after )?
[22:06:55] <SnoopJ> because the slice applies to the result of the call
[22:07:18] <SnoopJ> `str(obj)[i]` translates to English as `call str() on obj, then index the result with i`

[22:07:52] <SnoopJ> duszek, looking at the program a little more closely, maybe you meant to use `xlist` and `ylist` instead of `x` and `y` in that part of the program

[22:15:32] <SnoopJ> duszek, here's how I would rewrite some parts of the program to make it easier to see what's going on: https://bpa.st/54BQ
[22:16:19] <SnoopJ> `for i in range(len(thing))` is usually not the best way to do it in Python, but if you're used to other languages you might end up doing it a lot.
[22:17:14] <duszek> SnoopJ: is intersection built in Python?
[22:17:16] *** Joins: adiKt (uid472628@id-472628.tinside.irccloud.com)
[22:17:26] <SnoopJ> duszek, yes, the set() type knows how to do that :)
[22:18:01] <Jenna64bit> yes, and if you have a custom class you want to do intersections with, you can use non default hash dunders for it
[22:18:18] <SnoopJ> no need for a custom class here
[22:18:22] <duszek> SnoopJ: Okay, I understand it now.

[23:52:19] <jaggz> how do I implement a sharpening filter that works on larger scale features, darkening large strips, ligtening large strips

[23:53:07] <jaggz> like, imagine you have an xray of a bone (inverte), and giving it a radius you can make it so the bone itself is lighter, with nice sharp lines at its edge where it transitions into other tissues
[23:53:31] <jaggz> gimp has a "Sharpen (Unsharp mask)" which works, but I'm trying to make a cli tool in python

[23:57:00] <hodapp> unsharp mask is quite easy to implement; IIRC, it's literally just blurring the image, and then subtracting that blur
[23:57:19] <jaggz> i was doing that and it looks just blurrier and blurrier
[23:57:30] <hodapp> it's simple enough that it used to be done manually with film and blurred negatives and a literal mask
[23:57:54] <hodapp> what are you doing, Gaussian blur of some radius, and subtracting that from the image?
