[00:21:27] <KDev> https://i.ibb.co/4WS0Fv6/Screenshot-2021-12-08-002922.png Hello, when building an API, what would the best practice be for retrieving information like the highlighted section on my screenshot? This is the front page. Would I make a specific route for my home page to consume that retrieves all this data in one JSON object? Or would I have an api route for each statistic? Like api/orders/total/revenue, api/orders/total and each of my
[00:21:28] <KDev> react components would consume those apis?
[00:22:14] <KDev> If anyone has any links to share related to this topic, I'd love to read it as well

[03:06:49] <ljharb> it's fine to decide that the semantic you need is "truthiness/falsiness" or "non-nullish/nullish" or "undefined/not undefined" or "null/not null", it depends on what you're doing
[03:07:02] <devslash> so that it will always be null or a valid string value

[03:17:18] <systemfault> And it removes useless discussions about formatting..

[03:18:44] <matsaman> heh
[03:18:51] <systemfault> eslint-prettier is hard to beat... no more discussions and a thoroughly consistent codebase.

[03:20:43] <ljharb> matsaman: however, there doesn't exist any reliable CST tool, as opposed to AST, that also handles comments well
[03:21:08] <matsaman> fun programming task for someone, then
[03:21:08] <ljharb> matsaman: so until such a thing exists, formatting transforms are always potentially lossy, so reformatting for each viewer would be a reckless approach
[03:21:11] <obimod> what about warnings vs errors? can't you just create a precommit hook to make sure eslint doesn't through errors?

[03:21:32] <ljharb> obimod: only things that block merging are useful
[03:21:36] <obimod> prettier seems to automated to enforce... could backfire in some places
[03:21:39] <ljharb> obimod: and precommit hooks are terrible, they slow down rebasing.
[03:21:53] <ljharb> obimod: and also, git hooks aren't supposed to ever be installed dynamically, husky-style - that's a huge security hole
[03:22:01] <obimod> well, when you have different people working on the same project, adding a warning is a lot easier to convince ppl
[03:22:02] <matsaman> well, honestly I encounter this nonsense more in the Python world with Black zealots
[03:22:04] <ljharb> obimod: there's a reason git itself doesn't allow git hooks to be activated silently
[03:22:12] <obimod> so for instance if you like vim and a line length of 80...
[03:22:13] <ljharb> obimod: in my experience there's far easier ways
[03:22:21] <ljharb> obimod: but also, line length is a shitty rule that should always be disabled
[03:22:29] <ljharb> matsaman: … with what?
[03:23:04] <matsaman> ljharb: oh yeah, that's part of it
[03:23:11] <matsaman> in python there's literally a package named 'black'
[03:23:17] <matsaman> I couldn't make this shit up
[03:23:46] <matsaman> and the idea with "black" is that when you commit code, you have the system automatically reformat it so it's all "the same"
[03:23:59] <ljharb> matsaman: ok thank you for clarifying, maybe next time qualify it the first time :-p
[03:24:04] <ljharb> matsaman: yes, that idea is how go works
[03:24:09] <obimod> ljharb: it's nice to not have to worry about wrapping, and i'm not a fan of hiding code, and using vim allows me incredible amount of screen size dynamics... so i recognize that we have a difference in opinion regarding line length requirements and being an empathetic human being i'm okay with that and realize it is better to agree to disagree than promote obstinance.
[03:24:11] <ljharb> matsaman: it's a great idea when the language does it, it's always a terrible idea otherwise
[03:24:12] <matsaman> I mean I capitalized it, but I understand your confusion entirely yes =)
[03:24:23] <ljharb> matsaman: capitalizing it is the proper way to describe the group of people, fwiw
[03:24:29] <ljharb> matsaman: hence my confusion
[03:24:36] <ljharb> obimod: wrapping is fine
[03:25:02] <ljharb> obimod: the problem is that a line length rule produces worse code, as people bend over backwards to satisfy the line length requirement. it's almost the sole reason prettier produces ugly code.
[03:25:32] <matsaman> ljharb: it's a terrible name for software
[03:25:41] <obimod> ljharb: that's a fair argument, but that is a school of thought. pythonic being a key term to an alternative school.
[03:25:45] <systemfault> The stupid 80 char rules often leads to shitty variable/function naming
[03:26:03] <matsaman> especially when you can just tell your editor to automatically wrap at 80 chars on its own

[05:26:10] <df00z> Or is it handled by the implementation - if you do multiple sends in a short timeframe network wise the frames might get combined, but websocket wise they will be separate frames due to websocket keeping track of packet length etc

[05:35:58] <KDev> but yes @df00z had the right idea on what I was originally going to do. But, because there is no row "sold" and it's all only achieved through joins and such to get that info, there is no way to actually sort by that using my plugin method. But, I could add an aggregated column and sort by that.
[05:37:18] <KDev> I guess the issue is, do I want to aggregate for every row if someone is accessing /api/products? should every row contain an aggregate "sold", hmm. I suppose it could be useful information, but I will really only access it when i'm sorting by it.

[07:01:45] <ThePendulum> anyone doing Advent of Code, look away. it's a bit unreliable on repl.it, but anyone have an idea why the sample input seems to take longer than the much bigger main input? I didn't think there would be any difference, since it's shifting the array per generation and the number of fish are only added once https://replit.com/@ThePendulum/WeepyFlawlessMining#index.js
[07:02:49] <ThePendulum> on my local it's consistently ~2.2ms vs ~0.2ms
[07:03:31] <ThePendulum> ah it seems the order in which you run them makes all the difference
[07:04:44] <ThePendulum> although if I first do a dummy run and then measure them, I still get about 0.230ms for the sample vs 0.150ms for the main input

[18:46:32] <banana_> .vscode is version controlled in project
[18:46:58] <obimod> by "that setting" do you mean the various plugin options for your workspace?
[18:47:07] <banana_> would be cool if there was a generic way to control set up on all popular text editors
[18:47:13] <banana_> yep
[18:47:29] <obimod> nice!
[18:47:34] <banana_> like extensions.json will prompt another dev to install the recommended plugins
[18:47:49] <banana_> the recommended plugins can be listed in extensions.json
[18:48:24] <obimod> that's probably all you need then, since languages have their own tooling and conf files e.g. eslintrc which the plugins read
[18:48:25] <banana_> and that prompt is super convenient because it's just "Install recommended plugins" in VSCode is pretty seamless
[18:48:59] <obimod> editor agnostic tooling configuration is a good thing
[18:49:18] <|Psycho|> I change an element id with Jquery >> $(this).attr('id', 'new_id'); It does work, but it keeps listening events hooked to the old id, why is that?

[23:09:07] <dimi1947> as I said leanr how it works and maybe add one or 2 features
[23:09:09] <sheetjs> silly: be careful
[23:09:19] <sheetjs> dimi1947: with fullcalendar, there are a few repos on github
[23:09:22] <silly> how much js do you already know? also there is typescript. if your goal is to learn js, then i'd suggest you to read this instead
[23:09:32] <sheetjs> https://github.com/fullcalendar/fullcalendar is MIT licensed

[23:09:33] <jellobot> dimi1947, Eloquent JavaScript is a comprehensive introductory Web-based book with examples and a built-in interpreter. http://eloquentjavascript.net/
[23:09:39] <sheetjs> BUT https://github.com/fullcalendar/fullcalendar-scheduler is not

[23:11:07] <dimi1947> what all these mean in the end?
[23:11:45] <silly> they can potentially sue you to get some of your $$$
[23:12:17] *** nomic2 is now known as nomic
[23:13:01] <dimi1947> you mean I CANOOT modify the code?
[23:13:17] <sheetjs> you are free to modify the original fullcalendar code
[23:13:23] <dimi1947> yes...
[23:13:32] <silly> if you only use fullcalendar there's no problem, if you add some of their premium stuff or this fullcalendar-scheduler thing, you might have to buy in
[23:13:44] <dimi1947> yeah
[23:14:05] <sheetjs> the unknown here is whether the mit licensed stuff depends on the proprietary stuff, but assumably not
[23:14:11] <dimi1947> no intention modifying premium plugins/scheduler
[23:14:47] <sheetjs> yeah then just clone the open source and make sure you can build it
[23:15:34] <dimi1947> well I am at that stage..trying to learn how to build a feature fore example

[23:46:43] <qswz> what's your go to xml npm lib guys?
[23:46:59] <timwis> Hi all, is there any way to disable microphone access on a page? I’m writing a browser extension to disable it on google meet, for when you join a hybrid meeting next to someone else on the meeting, to avoid the feedback screech. I’m currently just triggering .click() on the mute button, but I’d love to disable it entirely, to better account for edge cases
[23:47:00] <qswz> been using xml-js so far but wondering
[23:47:21] <qswz> timwis: CSP headers
[23:47:42] <qswz> Feature-Policy header actually
[23:48:14] <timwis> qswz: this is for a browser extension to be run on meet.google.com, so I don’t have control of headers
[23:48:39] <qswz> no idea then
[23:48:41] <timwis> Thought maybe I could tap into getUserMedia and disable it somehow
[23:49:00] <timwis> Or monkey patch it as a last resort
[23:50:09] <ljharb> qswz: my goto xml lib is "fuck you"
[23:50:22] <ljharb> xml is gross :-p

[23:53:07] <qswz> in mycase a security system api
[23:53:45] <qswz> there could be a XML global just like JSON
