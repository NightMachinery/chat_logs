[23:00:54] <Khaytsus> Get on the znc host and do standard diagnosis?  Can the machine really resolve the name?  ping, host, etc.
[23:07:12] <darkbasic92> Nope, "no answer" with nslookup. But specifically for that server. (? rofl)

[23:10:29] <Khaytsus> So not a znc issue.
[23:11:14] <darkbasic92> No answer with nslookup specifically over ZNC, should have clarified. I am running it on docker and through docker terminal it does not resolve. If I do it from this Windows machine it works fine
[23:11:36] <darkbasic92> But specifically this server I repeat, at this moment for example I am connected here just fine
[23:12:14] *** Joins: PowaBanga (~PowaBanga@user/powabanga)
[23:13:17] <Khaytsus> And the container is on the same machine?
[23:14:56] <darkbasic92> No, but the host machine (a q9400 I use as a 24/7 home server) can resolve it fine as well, only the docker itself
[23:15:43] <Khaytsus> Not sure what to tell you, not znc
[23:16:11] <darkbasic92> Perhaps a fault of docker itself? Maybe I should update everything and recheck

[23:36:20] <tusko> I get a flood of /who replies
[23:36:35] <tusko> and my connection routinely drops

[23:37:36] <Khaytsus> Well, route replies isn't causing who responses.  that's your client or a script your client is running or something along those lines.
[23:38:29] <tusko> honestly I don't even know what a /who is
[23:39:38] <tusko> but t*route_replies does say 'Send replies (e.g. to /who) to the right client only'
[23:39:55] <DarthGandalf> that's details of IRC protocol
[23:40:03] <DarthGandalf> to keep list of nicks on channel in sync
[23:40:06] <DarthGandalf> and who's away
[23:41:25] <DarthGandalf> often, if the client received reply to /who (and other commands) which it didn't request, it's confused and just dumps it to user
[23:42:03] <DarthGandalf> and this is a common scenario if you have several clients connected, which don't know about each other
[23:42:57] <Khaytsus> I most often got it with bans..  some clients for some reason like to look at the ban list, I can't figure out hwy, but they do
[23:43:08] <Khaytsus> And I'd get a bans output on my other clients randomly
