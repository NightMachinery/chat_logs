[02:27:01] <Joanna> Hi everyone
[03:16:43] <EdFletcher> Odd, I read about that gravitational wave distortion study days ago on a mainstream publication… https://www.quantamagazine.org/gravitational-waves-should-permanently-distort-space-time-20211208/
[03:30:52] <jan6> it prolly depends WHAT mainstream publications you use, and what you define as mainstream
[03:31:38] <jan6> I for example wouldn't classify it as "main mainstream"
[03:32:00] <jan6> but within the niche of people interested about sciency stuff and whatnot, it might well be
[03:32:39] <jan6> just like "IEEE Spectrum" might be mainstream in some circles, but layperson wouldn't even know it exists, nevermind read it
[03:33:29] <jan6> it might be well known publication of one of the world's largest organizations, but that doesn't mean it's mainstream to most people

[18:00:15] <Joanna> I heard there are some big tornadoes happening lately causing me to once again ponder as to why tornado proof buildings are not built in tornado prone areas. It’s as if they are offering up the entire population there as human sacrifices...
