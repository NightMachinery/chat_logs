I have articles from arch I am going to read eventually. Can't post the error as it is installing a kernel right now sadly.

[02:28:59] <semiote> it should show your HMDI/DP output there aswell. might be missing or buggy support in the device/driver itself.

[03:46:43] <Hello71> rawktucc: wireguard
[03:47:13] <rawktucc> CORRECT
[03:47:15] <rawktucc> thank you so much
[03:47:42] <rawktucc> I have a wg connection between two hetzner servers, but I guess it's listening on one of them for some reason
[03:47:46] <rawktucc> wish I could disable that
[03:49:16] <bloodfart69> Probably have to create my own EDID file
[03:50:00] <Foxboron> kailo: That is not going to happen. It's still a different distro and we dont have anything to do with it
[03:50:01] <Arsimael> rawktucc, why do you have a WG connection between two Hetzner servers?
[03:50:07] <rawktucc> Arsimael, for secure NFS
[03:50:15] <rawktucc> without needing to do kerberos and all that auth nonsense
[03:50:20] <Arsimael> you know Hetzner offers VLANs right?
[03:50:31] <Arsimael> As long as the are in the same account
[03:50:31] <rawktucc> the data would be unencrypted though
[03:50:38] <rawktucc> yeah same account and same rack/DC even
[03:51:13] *** Joins: tzlil (~tzlil@user/tzlil)
[03:52:53] <rawktucc> Arsimael, would a vlan help performance wise versus wg? vlan seems much more complicated, I'd have to implement nfs auth
[03:54:09] <Arsimael> if you want an encrypted transfer, you need to use Wireguard, stunnel or any other VPN solution, since (AFAIK) NFS is clear-text.

[03:54:34] <rawktucc> yup, that's the goal. i love wg because it's so easy
[03:55:17] <Arsimael> vLans are only for seperating traffic from each other. Means vLan1 and vLan2 act like complete seperate LAN connections even if they use the same hardware

[03:57:43] <Arsimael> but with vLans you could shorten the routes. means if you add both servers to one vlan and increase the MTU from 1500 to 5000, maybe you could speed up the transfer. (if the Network hardware supports it)

[08:59:25] <KillerWasp> hello
[08:59:42] <Syntax-> hi
[08:59:46] <KillerWasp> i found a old system of oct 25  2016. i guess that's from the begin of archlinux 64 (where stop maintain for 32 bits). What do I do with the system? remove all or save like a collection?

[09:01:19] <KillerWasp> I think it is ontopic in the canal, since it was a system actively maintained by the community, before it was divided.
[09:01:25] <KillerWasp> s/canal/channel/
[09:02:44] <KillerWasp> The thing is, it would be a shame to delete it, whether I delete all the files or send you a 100GB update. (?)
[09:03:00] <kevr> lol

[13:21:04] <tacokoneko> hi I have an issue where Legacy OpenGL software has extremely bad performance with virgl graphics device inside QEMU/KVM virtual machines. Minecraft Classic 0.30 in minimal clean installed Arch Linux QEMU/KVM guest versus in minimal clean installed Ubuntu Server 20.04 guest: https://tacosukoneko.tk/_matrix/media/r0/download/tacosukoneko.tk/mPSJzWPFqafaeSjHPAXagUgV 
[13:21:16] <tacokoneko> in Arch Linux it never surpasses 1 FPS while in Ubuntu it usually never falls below 200. host is Arch Linux. brief list of software I know to be affected by this: glxgears, OpenGL 1 portion of glkitty, geodesicgears from xscreensaver, minecraft classic. the number of configs and logs involved here is huge so it might not be productive to paste them all at once, just tell me what would be best to paste first

[14:56:17] <Franciman> hi all, does arch linux support using an init system other than systemd?

[14:57:29] <jelle> Franciman: no :)
[14:57:29] <Franciman> i see, no problem. I was asking because I am building my own kernel, and I read that systemd requires the kernel to have some config enabled
[14:57:47] <Franciman> so configuring it with a less assuming init system would've been easier. But no prob
[14:58:35] <jelle> Franciman: it's not much about assuming, it's basically it requires some kernel functionality to function
[14:58:40] <jelle> as in cgroups
[14:58:44] <tacokoneko> Franciman: you could look at the default arch linux kernel (zcat /proc/config.gz) to see a good starting place if you aren't sure exactly what configuration to use. arch build system can also help you i believe

[15:10:09] <labrador> s0lid7, thats ofcourse true

[15:11:07] <labrador> Even javascript for moar speed

[15:14:00] <s0lid7> Or vise versa... Suppose it is better to use ff for that setting
[15:14:11] <labrador> yeah then not required,if firefox works correctly. I feel like ublock origin would work better.
[15:14:26] <s0lid7> Hmm, better in what way?
[15:15:31] <s0lid7> I think extensions tend to use more ram, if you set them to do more "work"

[17:40:02] <alad> that's why I clarified "to a different display server"
[17:40:13] <raster> but it still is a workflow change
[17:40:13] <pomo> yea and most guides are made for X so moving to wayland isn't great for newbie users

[17:40:30] *** Joins: buttermelted (~buttermel@213-225-36-61.nat.highway.a1.net)
[17:40:31] <ouestbillie> ok so i sanity checked with arandr and basically
[17:40:39] <raster> it's still a lot more work than either using arandr, learnnig xrandr ...
[17:40:50] <ouestbillie> the mouse follows the layout but i3 doesn't
[17:40:51] <alad> sure
[17:40:58] <raster> ouestbillie: what is your problem?
[17:41:01] <alad> ouestbillie: in what sense precisely?
[17:41:10] <pomo> i mean doesn't x normally fit the display?
[17:41:18] <pomo> i never had to touch xrandr unles sin a vm
[17:41:23] *** Quits: buttermelted (~buttermel@213-225-36-61.nat.highway.a1.net) (Remote host closed the connection)
[17:41:26] <pomo> *unless in
[17:42:04] <raster> ouestbillie: is the problme that you expand your screen to span 2 screens but i3 keeps all the windows where they currently are and doesnt start using the next screen?
[17:42:37] <raster> (the mouse can move over there burt i3 keeps the windows where they were and seems unaware of the screen size change)
[17:42:41] <ouestbillie> after xrandr --output HDMI-1 --right-of DP-2 the mouse will correctly move to the screen according to said layout but i3 detects focus inverted. 
[17:42:54] <ouestbillie> no don't expand just side by side
[17:43:15] <raster> well errr expan i mean the geometry of the root window expands
[17:43:21] <raster> ie u get a blank screen on the right
[17:43:36] <ouestbillie> it worked before but I had nvidia driver crust, I just did a fresh install with free drivers, contemplating whether that s the root
[17:43:55] <raster> i dont know - never used i3
[17:44:03] <raster> so some guesses.
[17:44:14] <Franciman> how can I get a list of unneeded packages with pacman?
[17:44:24] <Franciman> by unneeded i mean that they were installed as dependencies of software I removed
[17:44:30] <raster> i3 may be unaware of randr and instead look at xinerama. nvidia exposes xinerama scren info thus i3 works, but your new drivers only expose randr info
[17:44:38] <raster> i actually havent looked inot xinerama for a decade+
[17:44:44] <raster>  randr kind of took over...

[17:46:43] <raster> rcf: then beats me what's going on... i do know randr has some dark corners depending on driver. like optimus setups requore you force a refresh to get proper edid info and screen connect info etc.

[17:47:30] <rcf> ouestbillie: if you just changed drivers, and this is an existing config... the output names probably changed. 
[17:47:35] <raster> a user ran into that and had to add a forced randr refresh into e to fix that because randr would not pick up new screens properly on its own (when plugged in)

[17:51:59] <raster> but e is kind of affected differently than some others as it maintains its x connection and modifgies randr properties directly itself - it never executes xrandr and thus has to force libxrandr to refresh data and this requires a server-round-trip to force the server side to do it

[17:53:44] <raster> thus if you happened to use the xrandr binary it happened to work by luck.

[23:15:37] <thrice> same
[23:15:40] <gehidore> ouestbillie they're talking about during the install
[23:15:51] <Namarrgon> the great firewall of the PRNK probably blocks it
[23:16:23] <apestoso> by default my resolv.conf file says "# Generated by NetworkManager
[23:16:23] <apestoso> nameserver 192.168.0.1"
[23:16:33] <gehidore> I don't comprehend why one would, or could, log into msft account while installing last I checked you can't text browser your way through msft login

[23:56:18] <MrElendig> resolved generally works pretty well with networkd and nm
[23:56:22] <CodeSpelunker> I had set up unbound a little while ago, but now I feel like its overkill
[23:56:39] <MrElendig> but nothing wrong with not using a local resolver too
[23:56:43] <CodeSpelunker> so, I'm looking to replace it with one of those two I mentioned
