[11:23:29] <jotham> agreed
[11:24:58] <Renderwww> zomg, the game has a gold rating on protondb https://www.protondb.com/app/1085750
[11:25:14] <jotham> they know their real audience is communist foss users

[11:26:19] <Renderwww> can't wait for the "have sex with diicktators" bundle on indigala one day
[11:26:52] <jotham> do i have to risk getting banished from new zealand for doing a jacinda ardern one

[11:27:35] <jotham> hehe
[11:30:47] <T`aZ> why, WHY
[11:30:59] <jotham> you're never gonna know T`aZ 
[11:31:05] <jotham> it's a mystery
[11:31:11] <jotham> like why someone sent me a $500 air fryer 
[11:31:17] <jotham> when i'm living hand to mouth basically
[11:31:25] <jotham> i shoulda resolled it, but sounded bad to do with a gift
[11:31:26] <T`aZ> the monster
[11:31:37] <jotham> also i am now accustomed to air fryed frozen meat
[11:31:39] <jotham> it's quite cheap and good
[11:31:53] <Renderwww> "air fryer"
[11:31:54] <T`aZ> omfg, let me repeat
[11:31:58] <Renderwww> "fryer"
[11:31:58] <T`aZ> why, WHY
[11:32:00] <jotham> yeah Renderwww 
[11:32:08] <jotham> that was the whole joke of bringing it up
[11:32:11] <T`aZ> it's not frying if it's not in fat
[11:32:11] <Renderwww> back in the days we called that an oven
[11:32:17] <jotham> right
[11:32:28] <jotham> let me reiterate, it was and is a wtf
[11:32:55] <jotham> this thing https://www.philips.co.nz/c-m-ho/cooking/airfryer-xxl
[11:33:03] <jotham> can do a whole chicken in it
[11:33:04] <Renderwww> my mother has one of those and for some reason thinks it's great
[11:33:05] <jotham> haven't tried that
[11:33:12] <jotham> for me it's cheaper than the oven, but is still an oven
[11:33:21] <jotham> yeah the internet appears to have gone mental on them
[11:33:24] <jotham> hence someone giving me one
[11:33:42] <jotham> anyway i will say this, it's crispier than an oven
[11:33:50] <jotham> and does offload tons of fat into the collection vessel 
[11:33:57] <Renderwww> maybe the air can circulate better around whatever you put in
[11:34:07] <jotham> but it seems a very limited use fad gadget
[11:34:29] <Renderwww> but calling it a fryer windes me up every time
[11:34:52] <jotham> https://www.etymonline.com/search?q=fry
[11:35:05] <jotham> not etymologically unsound 
[11:35:12] <jotham> but yes not what the word parochially means

[11:36:15] <Renderwww> etymology is something that creatonists use to argue
[11:36:30] <jotham> naah
[11:36:38] <jotham> because american english is horrible and destroyed the language
[11:36:48] <jotham> etymology is important for context of real english language through time
[11:37:06] <jotham> definitely not someone as a non native speaker should give a fuck about though

[11:44:17] <jotham> NZ used to copy Australias censorship laws

[15:00:24] <Faux> I had a go; not immediately grabbing me.
[15:02:44] <Carbonflux> was it tedious or something? 
[15:05:53] <Carbonflux> i guess i just have always liked the idea of Dyson spheres, i like to think about them in relation to the Fermi paradox, build a Dyson sphere, convert everything inside into programable matter, retreat into virtual worlds, etc.
[15:06:43] <BobTheTomato> somehow I doubt the links above are SFW
[15:06:49] <Carbonflux> ideas about what happens to civilizations, expand, self destruct or turn inwards.
[15:07:15] <Carbonflux> are you at work?
[15:07:26] <dukwon> i haven't seen a linux meme in a good while
[15:09:09] <BobTheTomato> usually on the work VPN but not right now, but my kids are around and don't want to erase my browser history atm
[15:09:21] <Carbonflux> links that are not safe for work are safe if you are not at work. It's like when you pretend to have Covid so you can "work" from home by bing watching sword art online and clicking various links.
[15:09:37] <Carbonflux> ah
[15:09:37] <BobTheTomato> lol
[15:13:03] <BobTheTomato> I can't play most games anymore anyway, for some reason just lost interest in them. I guess because in my younger years played them so much now I found 99.9% of them boring
[15:14:16] <BobTheTomato> When counterstrike (the original) first came out I would spend the whole weekend playing it without sleeping or eating
[15:14:20] <Carbonflux> they mostly have the same patterns or if they don't they are time sinks.
[15:15:56] <Carbonflux> ya, i loved old CS, i decided to try it again a few years ago, it was all hackers and crazy stuff, i did CS:GO for a while but it was not the same somehow.
[15:17:21] <Renderwww> after living here for almost a decade I finally decided to put a proper lamp in the living room
[15:17:37] <Renderwww> my past self was way smarter than my current self for not having bothered to do so
[15:17:42] <Renderwww> totally not worth the effort
[15:17:48] <Carbonflux> i got the skyrim 10 anv addition, doing another playthru of that has been kinda fun actually.
[15:18:10] <Renderwww> how many editions of skyrim do you own?
[15:18:13] <Carbonflux> did you buy a new lamp?
[15:18:34] <Renderwww> RGB one!
[15:18:56] <Renderwww> super market had them cheap and I wanted something dimmable and with adjustable light temperature for some time now
[15:19:04] <Renderwww> I want it dark and reddish in the evening
[15:19:40] <Carbonflux> just two really, original and special, the anniversary edition is a SE upgrade.
[15:20:02] <Carbonflux> ya, red it good at night
[15:20:39] <Carbonflux> i have these warm "edison" lights i like, tho they use a lot of electricity.
[15:21:19] <Carbonflux> but i really like the yellow color.
[15:32:42] <Faux> BOOO inefficient lighting.
[15:32:56] <Carbonflux> Been hearing a lot about this Russia invading Ukraine event, so i looked at a map, it seems like Russia has to invade Ukraine, just from the map, given Moscow's current historical frame of reference.
[15:34:41] <Carbonflux> heh ya, switching the whole house to LED lighting, san things like the above decorative lighting, actually cut my electric bill by around 20%.
[15:38:30] <Renderwww> are you allowed inefficient light in the UK after breaking free of the shackles of the EUDSSR?
[15:39:44] <Faux> I actually have seen them on sale whereas they weren't before, I dunno if it's just because we never enforced the law or if it's because it's allowed, though.
[15:40:03] <Faux> The lighting in our kitchen is outrageously terrible; I think it must be half-wave rectumfried with no smoothing.
[15:40:49] <Carbonflux> you just moved into a new house right?
[15:41:06] <Carbonflux> in my experience finding the right lighting takes some time.
[15:41:29] <Renderwww> get rgb, you'll have all the lights!
[15:41:37] <Carbonflux> heh
[15:42:11] <Faux> The lights in the kitchen that are "faulty" are not socketed.
[15:42:34] <Faux> I put cheap rgb in my mancave, I don't typically use the room lighting, 'cos I use PROPER CFL for my bias lighting.
[15:43:09] <Faux> Proper CFL is of course probably banned.
[15:43:39] <Carbonflux> ya, they are here.
[15:43:48] <Carbonflux> we have one left
[15:43:56] <Faux> I have plenty in storage.
[15:43:57] <Carbonflux> i am waiting for it to burn out
[15:44:14] <Faux> https://www.amazon.co.uk/Spectrum-Daylight-Photography-Studio-Lighting/dp/B087M3NV5H/ these things.
[15:44:53] <Carbonflux> well, you know Tesla thought FL was in fact the best form of lighting, i guess the issue is disposal.
[15:45:37] <Renderwww> suddenly teeth and hair falling out because of all the mercury
[15:45:51] <Faux> I've only broken, uh, all of them before they failed naturally.
[15:45:53] <Renderwww> at least with the hair I don't have a problem, I'm way ahead of anyone trying to mercury poison me
[15:46:01] <Carbonflux> i remember reading about Tesla lighting up whole rooms, just using air as a media.
[15:46:12] <Faux> https://contentgrid.thdstatic.com/hdus/en_US/DTCCOMNEW/Articles/types-of-LED-lights-section-5.jpg this kinda chart makes cfl look really good, especially at the high end.
[15:46:29] <Faux> (My desk lamp is probably 2000+ lumens)
[15:46:53] <Carbonflux> i had one CLF that produced a hum
[15:47:33] <Carbonflux> also they take a while to "warm up" reaching full brightness.
[15:47:47] <Faux> Yeah, the one I'm currently using is quite old, and takes like a minute to warm up.
[15:48:04] <Faux> Not actually a significant disadvantae for being turned on in the morning when I'm trying to wake up to work.
[15:48:21] <Carbonflux> thats a good point.
[15:48:49] <Faux> Purchased in 2016, no idea if it was idle before installation.
[15:49:00] <Faux> Probably on for 14h+/day.
[15:49:36] <Faux> Which would be 25,000 hours, actually a lot.
[15:50:13] <Carbonflux> i actually felt kind of betrayed by the whole thing, i bought all CLF's when they first came out, replaced every bulb but before any of them burned out it became illegal to put them in the trash.
[15:50:28] <Faux> Pfft, nobody obeys those laws.
[15:50:35] <Faux> At the small scale we use weee.
[15:50:52] <Carbonflux> heh
[15:51:28] <Renderwww> is it environment friendly to replace the old hot wire bulbs before they are used up?
[15:52:18] <Carbonflux> i honestly don't know.
[15:52:30] <Faux> For the planet, probably not. For you as a consumer, it might actually make economic sense over a two year period.
[15:53:02] <Faux> Apparently my Christmas present to myself has got lost in Germany somewhere, and then was ubernommened by the GLS. https://quad.pe/e/hTsK95bY6s.png
[15:54:14] <Renderwww> how can at arrive two times at a center when it doesn't leave inbetween?
[15:54:44] <Renderwww> also I suspect that list is read from bottom to top
[15:54:47] <Faux> They did send me an sms which basically said they had lost it, so maybe they re-shipped it, or they found it on the floor after a truck had left, or something.
[15:55:11] <Renderwww> GLS, not even once!
[15:55:33] <Faux> Never even heard of them, wonder what they sell as here.

[15:56:59] <Renderwww> "General Logistics Systems B.V., also known as GLS, is a British-owned logistics company based in Amsterdam, Netherlands."
[15:57:19] <Renderwww> globalism logistic systems!
[15:58:37] <Faux> Globalism Liberation Systems.
[15:59:34] <Renderwww> why do you keep ordering dongs from germany?
[16:00:28] <Faux> You know what they say, Germany is the leading supplier of certain types of thing.
[16:04:03] <Renderwww> I wish I gotsupplied with a steam dong already
[16:04:23] <Faux> Oh, still waiting for that? You ordered that in like 2020 take 2, didn't you?
[16:04:44] <Renderwww> valve style it got delayed
[16:04:53] <Renderwww> and they blamed it on the silicon shortage!
[16:05:20] <Faux> Oh yeah, and the global shipping crisis. This is why we have to buy things from Germany and not from China. Clearly an EU imperialist plot.
[16:06:02] <Renderwww> to bad there are no EU produced giraffics cards
[16:06:09] <Faux> Aye.

[16:20:59] <dukwon> infinity rocket plastics
[16:21:55] <dukwon> i am confused by customs declarations
[16:22:36] <dukwon> i did an eye test in the UK before xmas (so i didn't have to speak german) and bought some new glasses because mine are falling apart
[16:22:56] <dukwon> i got the opticians to send them to my parents so they could forward them to me
[16:23:29] <dukwon> my mum did the customs declaration and there's no option for "sending personal belongings"
[16:23:51] <dukwon> just stuff like "gift", "sale", "sample" etc
[16:24:09] <dukwon> i guess because they're a recent purchase they'd be viewed as a "sale"
[16:24:25] <Faux> It's a gift, 'cos that's the thing you don't have to pay tax on.
[16:24:33] <dukwon> yeah that's what my mum put
[16:24:49] <dukwon> but at £209 they're above the duty/tax-free limit
[16:25:29] <dukwon> i think the duty or whatever was factored into the courier's price
[16:25:48] <Faux> Eurgh.
[16:25:54] <Faux> Seems very unreasonable.
[16:26:26] <dukwon> but what if e.g. i wanted her to send me one of my old suits (bought 15 years ago) for a wedding?
[16:26:39] <dukwon> should i pay duty on that?
[16:26:49] <dukwon> i don't pay duty on the clothes i wear on holiday
[16:27:02] <dukwon> i don't get it
[16:27:41] <Faux> The "aim" is to support local business, so it applying to your suit would make sense. However, what's the actual value of that suit, at auction; £10? What's the value of your glasses to someone that isn't you? £1?
[16:28:04] <dukwon> yeah, they'd need exactly my prescription
[16:29:51] * Faux goes back to trying to fill in a tax form; like a whole week to go.
[16:30:45] <dukwon> i'm worried about next year's tax return
[16:31:07] <Faux> Mine will be simple next year, no new complex financial schemes (yet!).
[16:31:21] <dukwon> i believe that since i'm in germany for slightly less than 6 months, i won't have to declare my CERN salary
[16:31:55] <dukwon> germany is a CERN member so shouldn't tax it anyway, but i don't expect every single tax office in the country to know that
[16:32:21] <Faux> One of the tax forms is named BV981, but if you google for that you get only box language results.
[16:32:41] <Faux> Just post HMRC one of these. https://shopee.co.id/Stok.Lagi-184-Terlaris..-Mukenaanak-Rukoh-Import-Murah-Terbar-BV981-Bali-Rose-Marry-i.92963447.7918847967
[16:33:10] <dukwon> a woman?
[16:33:17] <Faux> Yeah. Their problem now.
[16:34:18] <dukwon> i wonder if there's a polygamous society with a tax on wives
[16:34:35] <dukwon> "you owe us 1 of your 5 wifes to pay the 20% marriage tax"
[16:34:38] <Faux> Window tax, extended edition.
[16:36:16] <dukwon> <dukwon> why are there no women in here?
[16:36:51] <Faux> https://quad.pe/e/Pm8apsnqJV.png
[16:37:08] <dukwon> nice
