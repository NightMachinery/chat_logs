[05:59:16] <nickspoon> Hello, and yes please
[05:59:58] <nickspoon> It is Monday afternoon. Tell me of your misadventures, nova.
[06:00:09] <nickspoon> Tried alpine yet?
[06:01:53] <nickspoon> Oh gentoo was up next. That's one I've never tried but always meant to.
[06:02:23] <nova> I have not tried alpine. Here is the tl;dr. You know of nixos: too niche, seems annoying to me. Then I tried gentoo. Cyclic dependencies. Unable to install for over 2 days. Ridiculous wait time when installing also. Arch is indisputably the ultimate desktop distro. I am thoroughly annoyed. I am back to arch, and it feels SO good.
[06:03:05] <nova> (ps, pacman repos have the cyclic harfbuzz dependencies, too, but it doesn't jam up everything in a ridiculously confusing way.)
[06:03:28] *** Quits: pulse (~pulse@user/pulse) (Quit: brlbrlbrbl)
[06:03:42] <nova> also openrc is garbage
[06:03:52] <nickspoon> Well this is excellent. Now I don't have to do any of that testing myself.
[06:04:04] <nickspoon> oh really? I liked the idea of openrc
[06:04:12] <nickspoon> alpine are currently writing something new though
[06:04:38] <nova> alpine looks like a server-oriented distro
[06:04:48] *** Joins: jaggz (~jaggz@user/jaggz)
[06:05:06] <jaggz> I needed an enter in my vim macro
[06:05:14] <jaggz> :$/\t"\1",/^M;nohlsearch^M
[06:05:41] <nickspoon> Yeah it's ideal for containers and servers, I think it sounds interesting as a desktop too though
[06:06:03] <nickspoon> jaggz: use <C-v><CR>
[06:06:14] <nickspoon> when entering the macro
[06:06:22] <jaggz> I placed that macro on a # commented line in my python script, and it seems the python interpreter evaluates the ^M as an actual newline, so it tries to execute the ;nohlsearch as a python command
[06:06:36] <nickspoon> oh
[06:06:38] <jaggz> nickspoon, yeah that's what I did.. I need another representation now
[06:06:55] <nova> really depends how you make the macro. why python? you can also use :execute "...\<cr>"
[06:07:33] <jaggz> I can edit the macro.. it's a convenience little thing I just use when editing the python code
[06:07:53] <jaggz> here I have to keep replacing paths with <tab>"path",
[06:08:58] <jaggz> what's that execute thing?  
[06:09:13] <nova> jaggz, can you start from square one? Maybe you would get better help instead of trying to kill flies with lasers
[06:09:29] <jaggz> so instead of the commands, put the commands in there in "string" and use :execute (which will evaluate <keys>) ?
[06:09:56] <nickspoon> \<keys>   <- note the backslash
[06:10:13] <nickspoon> And you must use double-quotes, not single
[06:11:17] <jaggz> no range allowed
[06:11:25] <nickspoon> I don't know what you're doing
[06:11:35] <nova> vimgor xy
[06:11:35] <vimgor> XY is asking about your attempted solution rather than your actual problem. E.g. you want to kill flies and think of a laser with a targeting system. You have a laser from a CD ROM, so you ask about a targeting system and get no useful replies. If you'd asked about flies you'd been directed towards chemical methods and eventually solved your problem. http://meta.stackexchange.com/a/66378/181948
[06:12:01] <nickspoon> let @a = "iSome text\<CR>Next line\<CR>\<Esc>"
[06:12:03] <jaggz> nova, maybe.. although right now I'm working on some files on a foreign system, and pasting them into my python code, and wanted to automate making those into a list.
[06:12:16] <jaggz> but, good point. I'll put them in a text file and just have it load those (ignoring comments)
[06:12:27] <jaggz> still would like to be able to handle this ^M thing just in case though :)
[06:12:53] <nickspoon> jaggz: check my last comment and see if that format helps
[06:13:13] *** Quits: lil_isaac (~lil_isaac@159.48.55.95) (Quit: Konversation terminated!)
[06:13:18] <jaggz> nickspoon, basically, I'm selecting a range of lines and doing :s/^/\t"/<cr>  on them
[06:13:27] <jaggz> but with the ending ", on the line too
[06:13:55] <jaggz> oh, I didn't want to put it permanently in my vimrc so sometimes I'll just put a macro in a comment in a file
[06:14:12] <nova> well, you could always create a function in a file that ends with ".vim". Inside that file you could also make a command like {{command -nargs=0 MyCommand :call MyFunction()<cr>}}. Then you could distribute that vim script wherever you wanted and do {{:source myScript.vim}} wherever you distributed it to (or just stick it in ~/.vim/plugins/myScript.vim)
[06:14:17] <jaggz> "ay  yank it into register a and use it

[06:14:49] <nickspoon> jaggz: yeah I get it, but if you want it in a format that doesn't use ^M, use the "\<CR>" notation
[06:15:13] <nova> I always have ~/.vim/plugins/work.vim for works stuff. It seems easier than building finicky macros to distribute inside of text files or code (but that's just a hunch)
[06:15:15] <jaggz> oh does that work on non :execute lines?
[06:15:27] <nickspoon> It works as I said a few comments ago
[06:15:30] <nickspoon> let @a = "iSome text\<CR>Next line\<CR>\<Esc>"
[06:15:37] <nickspoon> That creates macro a
[06:15:58] <jaggz> okay, so in commandline, double-quoted things handle that
[06:16:14] <nickspoon> yeah
[06:16:21] <jaggz> alright buds.. thanks
[06:16:28] <nickspoon> That's the difference between single and double quotes in vimscript
[06:17:10] *** Quits: gast0n (~g4570n@user/gast0n) (Ping timeout: 258 seconds)
[06:17:17] <jaggz> it was interesting to see python split the line
[06:17:27] <jaggz> and I wondered how I don't recall experiencing that before with other languages
[06:17:47] <jaggz> (it's partially because putting a macro in a comment is a rare thing for me to do, I think)

[21:27:03] <gpanders> I've never used that plugin, but what I've done in the past is use 'entr' with plantuml so that whenever I save the buffer in Vim the diagram is automatically regenerated

[21:29:46] <gpanders> https://eradman.com/entrproject/
[21:29:59] <gpanders> it should be in your package manager (assuming you're on some kind of Unix-y OS)
[21:32:19] <hajonnes> gpanders, I have only used plantUML setup described in the link. But how do you mean you used it. where is the diagrams drawn?
[21:33:19] <gpanders> plantuml ships as a command line tool. You can specify the output file and the format in the command line invocation. I don't have it installed right now and this was a while ago that I did it so I don't recall the exact specifics
[21:33:48] <gpanders> but the PlantUML documentation or the --help output from the CLI should be sufficient to get you started
[21:34:29] <hajonnes> gpanders, ok. I'll look in to it...
[21:38:42] <hajonnes> recommendation a good plugin manager?
[21:40:24] <gpanders> vim-plug is quite popular, though I personally prefer minpac as it uses Vim native packages

[22:28:26] <hajonnes> habamax, where do you render the graphics? This is how it looks for me. Rendered in firefox.https://imgur.com/oMQItC0
[22:29:14] <habamax> I render it to pdf from within asciidoctor using additional asciidoctor-diagram tools
[22:29:15] <hajonnes> habamax, a small version of dot is included so no need for graphviz.
[22:29:44] <habamax> but I could render it to a png or svg with commandline plantuml
[22:30:08] <habamax> so the question is what you expect vim to do for you?
[22:31:23] <hajonnes> what I liked with my setup was that when it worked I just typed :UP to rerender my graphics and then I could use firefox print as pdf and so on...

[22:32:02] <hajonnes> how is asciidoctor. is it fast to rerender?
[22:32:50] <habamax> well, you know there is asciidoctor.js extension for firefox and chrome like browsers? It can render adoc files including diagrams
[22:33:26] <hajonnes> would you say it is a better strategy to use it than vim and firefox?
[22:33:34] <habamax> so I usually write my adoc file, check it in browser (it is autoupdated, once you save your file) and see my diagrams there
[22:33:53] <hajonnes> That is nice...
[22:33:57] <habamax> hajonnes: you write it in vim and open the same file in firefox
[22:35:27] <habamax> https://i.imgur.com/z475PEp.png
[22:37:16] <hajonnes> It is very nice. So you write in vim and then where does asciidoctor come in? or how is it parsed to html?
[22:37:28] <hajonnes> habamax^
[22:37:34] <habamax> firefox extension does it for me
[22:37:49] <hajonnes> what is firefox extension?
[22:37:55] <habamax> asciidoctor.js
[22:37:57] <habamax> or smth
[22:38:21] <habamax> Asciidoctor.js Live Preview
[22:39:22] <habamax> and if you are into asciidoctor -> https://github.com/habamax/vim-asciidoctor
[22:40:20] <hajonnes> so now I have added it to firefox. Ok I will read that. Thanks for the information!
