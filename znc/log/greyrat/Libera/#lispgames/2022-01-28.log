[00:07:07] <borodust> openal is good and familiar when you already know opengl
[00:07:47] <borodust> there's also sdl mixer thing

[22:22:44] <artchad> Is there a way to enforce cl-opengl to use a certain OpenGL version?
[22:23:23] <artchad> so that it errors out whenever I use a call that's outside the defined version.

[22:30:57] <borodust> there's :cl-opengl/es2 for es2 specifically
[22:32:08] <borodust> i don't think there's another way, maybe |3b| knows
[22:32:20] <borodust> the problem is that it's not only about versions
[22:32:43] <borodust> like, there's 3.3 Core Profile and Compat Profile and they have different sets of available functions
[22:33:25] <artchad> oh, interesting

[22:33:33] *** Quits: toastiest (~crumpo@user/crumpo) (Remote host closed the connection)
[22:33:57] <borodust> it also possible have old profile enabled while still be able to query and use functions from newer ones
[22:34:12] <borodust> as an extension, for example
[22:34:17] <artchad> that would be my approach
[22:34:41] <artchad> I don't want people to see a message that their computer is too old for my game.
[22:35:04] <artchad> or has too little graphics capabilities
[22:39:56] <artchad> Btw. is there any real difference between sdl and sdl2 when you use an OpenGL context anyway?
[22:40:33] <artchad> lispbuilder-sdl has more thorogh documentation with examples compared to cl-sdl2

[23:18:48] <borodust> sdl1.2 is eol
[23:19:22] <borodust> but if it has everything you need, sure, go for it
[23:20:38] <borodust> Balooga is the author of lispbuilder, if i'm not misremembering
[23:24:00] <artchad> borodust: I decide wether it's eol. ;D
[23:24:20] <artchad> Common Lisp could also be considered EOL. :p
[23:30:21] <Jach> The opengl calls themselves will be the same. https://wiki.libsdl.org/MigrationGuide has an overview of some of the differences when it comes to migration, it convinced me to stop considering using SDL1.
[23:33:51] <artchad> alright, that list convinces me
[23:34:53] <artchad> But I feel a bit lost, because I want to learn GLES 2.0, but there are no real tutorials on that. And the cffi isn't really documented.
[23:35:57] <artchad> technology is complex
[23:37:17] <artchad> cl-opengl/es2 is a thing, btw.
