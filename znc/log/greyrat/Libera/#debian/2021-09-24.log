[14:15:08] <Blondie101010> ie: what problem are you having with auditd?
[14:15:30] <wwilliam> Is there a way to just log the rules i create? not all that other stuff/
[14:15:31] <wwilliam> ?
[14:17:30] <Blondie101010> you can remove rules you don't want, and clear them all with '-D'...  (note that you can change them live with auditctl, but also need to change the config files to persist a reboot)
[14:19:45] <wwilliam> I have no rules now if I add 1 rule such as auditctl /home/user -k home_user and do ausearch -k home_user i get whole bunch of data i dont want to see.
[14:20:00] <wwilliam> -w
[14:20:04] <wwilliam> forgot that.

[18:19:44] <faceface> hello
[18:20:10] <randall> hi faceface
[18:20:23] <hiya> somiaj: one i have kernel or anything from backports. it should auto-update right?
[18:20:31] <faceface> I'm running what I assumed to be a 'vanilla' debian on the hetzner cloud provider, and it seems that ports opened by docker are externally visible 'by default' (i.e. I didn't mess with anything yet)
[18:20:45] <faceface> When I apply hetzners firewall product, they are closed as you might expect
[18:21:11] <faceface> I'm just wondering if the first line of iptables should be 'DROP' and then I add 22 and 80 back?
[18:21:30] <faceface> Chain INPUT (policy ACCEPT)
[18:21:40] <jailbreak> somiaj, definitely KVS, not KMS (it's an x86 system) but after installing xfce4 it works and boots to lightdm. it's just LXQt that doesn't boot. jelly it's sorted but thanks for replying. :-)
[18:22:16] <faceface> hi hiya
[18:22:22] <faceface> sorry... hi randall
[18:22:36] <somiaj> hiya: yes, once you isntall the kernel meta package from backports, it will auto update from then on
[18:23:07] <faceface> https://paste.debian.net/1213103/
[18:23:11] <faceface> my iptables -L ^^

[18:23:32] <somiaj> jailbreak: I think the kvm message you are seeing is not causing your issues, I don't see why hardware virtualization support would cause boot/gpu issues, espically if you haven't installed any vm software.
[18:23:40] <randall> faceface: The usual way is to change the policy to DROP/REJECT and then whitelist the ports you want accessible.
[18:23:52] <faceface> when I open a random port using docker, e.g. with docker run --rm  -p 45678:80 nginx:alpine, I wasn't expecting that to be visible 'from the outside'
[18:23:54] <somiaj> jailbreak: but glad you got it to work. Again what gpu do you have? You may want to check if have the firmawre installed for your gpu see if that helps your system.
[18:24:04] <faceface> randall: cool, I see
[18:24:13] <faceface> So this is 'expected' behaviour?
[18:24:21] <jailbreak> somiaj, it moans about missing firmware (rx 580 8gb) but it works so don't really want to mess
[18:24:46] <randall> faceface: Depends a little on how docker is set up. If it binds to loopback or to all interfaces.
[18:25:08] <faceface> randall: by default the docker behaviour is expected, depending on firewall settings
[18:25:15] <faceface> so I'm asking if this is expected on deb
[18:25:42] <faceface> randall: I can 'turn this off' in docker by asking it explicitly to bind to just localhost
[18:25:48] *** Quits: pong (~beaver@user/pong) (Quit: grmbl)
[18:26:20] <randall> faceface: Then that is indeed "expected" behaviour, though a weird default docker did pick.
