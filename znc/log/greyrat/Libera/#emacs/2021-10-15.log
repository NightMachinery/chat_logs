[09:25:59] <codingquark> But your point is very important indeed. I need to make sure operating temperatures of my components are in acceptable ranges

During early winter mornings, I get enough dew that my car's windscreen needs a wipe with a cloth. Rest of the year is hot and dry AF.
[09:30:55] <codingquark> Like, really really dry. They call it "miserable" technically
[09:31:51] <Aurora_v_kosmose> I don't really mean dew in the way that it's used for environment/water, but really just for "at xyz temp, water condensates"
[09:31:56] <codingquark> Should even such dew cause issues? Inside my house, I never get any condensation
[09:32:12] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Your house isn't sealed and does have electronics lying at the lowest point.
[09:32:17] <Aurora_v_kosmose> *doesn't have
[09:32:54] <codingquark> Ah, so a good way to find this out is to see how my other devices like poorly cased RPi etc are doing, right?
[09:33:19] <codingquark> I use RPi as a server inside home. It stays there forever, the case is not weather-proof.
[09:33:29] <Aurora_v_kosmose> They might actually do better non-sealed, depending on how arid. But that'd of course expose them to every other environmental hazard there is.

[10:51:21] <akater[m]> My issues with Elisp manual:
[10:51:21] <akater[m]> 1. Elisp manual has a very free form, so free I don't know how would I add almost anything to it.  From my perspective there almost 0 struchure to it, compared to, say, CLHS.
[10:51:21] <akater[m]> 2. I don't want to think how do I get info on a function.  M-. means I don't think about it.  C-h f is slightly worse in that the docstring might not be there.  Info is even worse because it will only work for some (not all) built-in functions.  Documenting everything is hopeless, documenting only some parts is confusing.
[10:51:21] <akater[m]> 3. It's often more productive and instructive to provide examples than anything else.  Info pages don't do that.  The next useful data is type signature.  Info pages don't even mention return types often enough.

[15:08:11] <dragestil> EdwardIII: I went from vim to emacs a bit more than a year ago - was intially struggling with finding vim equivalence to C-d, C-u, . (repeat)
[15:08:33] <EdwardIII> dragestil: ah, same! and what did you do?
[15:09:05] <dragestil> nothing :) i only use emacs now, and don't miss those things somehow, which is weird
[15:09:07] <EdwardIII> (except like 1 week, not one year :)
[15:09:38] <EdwardIII> i was initially going to use it just for lisp stuff but it somehow just feels really good, so starting to use it at work
[15:09:54] <dragestil> sadly i don't remember much of the other struggles, should have really documented it...
[15:10:13] <artefact> EdwardIII: i use C-/ for undo and M-/ for redo (i use undo-fu). on my layout the / is on the 9

[15:10:58] <artefact> no shift
[15:11:04] <artefact> none of my key bindings have two modifiers
[15:11:09] <dragestil> i use C-/ for undo, and C-f C-/ for redo ;)

[15:11:53] <artefact> i could set up C-u C-/ [C-/ ...] for redo(s) with hydra, that feels emacs-y, but i don't actually need redo that often
[15:12:45] <artefact> C-/ is vanilla emacs. C-x u is too long/too hard to repeat and C-_ sucks on my layout (underscore requires level3 shift/alt gr)
[15:13:25] <artefact> i'm fine with vanilla emacs undo, i just use undo-fu because it can save the undo history persistently, which is very useful
[15:15:07] <dragestil> coming to think of, i now do C-v C-l subconciously as a way to replicate C-d in vim
[15:15:46] <dragestil> and C-e RET to replicate o in vim

[15:26:00] <EdwardIII> i looked at hydra, watched the video, and still didn't really understand it heh
[15:26:08] <EdwardIII> (again i guess TIAS is the true answer)
[15:26:21] <EdwardIII> i had a leader key in vim obviously but hydra seems different to that
[15:27:41] <artefact> it's not that different. have you noticed how you can do C-x e eeeeeee to repeat executing a recorded macro with C-x ( ?
[15:28:03] <artefact> with hydra you could make it so that C-x u uuuuuuu repeats undos, and much more
[15:28:19] <dragestil> EdwardIII: for me C-x or C-c in emacs are the rough equivalence of leader key in vim
[15:28:39] <artefact> also C-u
[15:28:48] <EdwardIII> artefact: no, not to
[15:28:58] <EdwardIII> artefact: no, becuase i haven't made any macros yet. but i take your point :)
[15:29:13] *** Joins: osfe__ (~lemaire@hermes.emn.fr)
[15:29:14] <dragestil> well, C-u is the prefix
[15:30:15] <dragestil> C-c x y in emacs is like \xy in vim (default leader key in vim is \ IIUC)
[15:30:27] <artefact> i almost never use C-u, i need to think more to type less
[15:30:43] <artefact> in fact, s/almost//
[15:31:26] <dragestil> and you can more or less bind anything to C-c x y where x and y are any keys, so emacs keybinding is not *that* crazy compared to vim
[15:31:43] *** Quits: af (~af@awalgarg.me) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[15:31:57] <EdwardIII> yess, i agree that making your own keybindings feels more natural in emacs (although sometimes i'm a bit scared, what if i conflict with some plugin i've installed, or i'm about to install)

[15:32:32] <dragestil> EdwardIII: C-c x y are meant for custom keybindings methinks
[15:32:35] <artefact> there's a few things that are reserved for the user, so you should be free to use them. C-c <single letter>, C-<punctuation>, f5-f9 iirc
[15:32:38] <dragestil> so that space is safe to bind
[15:32:46] <artefact> and any key chords beginning with those, obviously

[15:33:26] *** Quits: Pickchea (~private@user/pickchea) (Ping timeout: 245 seconds)
[15:33:45] <artefact> it's also fairly harmless to overwrite anything you want, with a few exceptions. C-h k is your best friend to answer the question "what am i losing if i want to rebind $x"
[15:33:50] <EdwardIII> my only other thing i'm really struggling with are remembering all the shortcuts. i have which-key, but that list is often sooo huuuuge it's a bit counter productive for me. but definitely better than nothing
[15:34:11] <dragestil> it takes time, C-h m helps
[15:34:20] <artefact> you don't really have to
[15:34:36] <artefact> i still use M-x for a lot of stuff i use infrequently. like eval-region or rgrep
[15:34:54] <EdwardIII> but i think so far the best thing about emacs is #emacs

[15:36:09] <artefact> a lot of major modes/plugins also share the same "spiritual" key bindings, so it becomes intuitive. like C-c C-c is "do the logical thing with the buffer", be it compile a tex file, send the e-mail, or git commit with this message

[19:48:59] <EdwardIII> cool, my first bit of proper elisp: https://github.com/EdwardIII/emacs-dotfiles/blob/main/customisations/init-erc.el 
[19:49:18] <grym> codingquark: but, until gyms feel safe again, i'm primarily rowing and cycling 
[19:49:39] *** Joins: diamondbond (~diamondbo@175.157.97.101)
[19:49:42] <dale> Personally I would rather go run and have a weight rack at home.
[19:49:44] <raiguy> I'm a simple man; I don't need a rowing machine. All I need is a gravel bike.
[19:49:47] <EdwardIII> (i'm sure i'm about to get correct about how 'proper' it really is :D)
[19:50:04] <grym> raiguy: that's my commuter :) 
[19:50:12] <rpav> a running machine and a set of weights goes a long way
[19:50:17] <codingquark> grym: very interesting! I cycled for a month, but the roads are not safe. One of the friends met a horrific accident which absolutely pushed me over to stop bicycling. So I am looking for another option
[19:50:21] <grym> running .... machine ... 
[19:50:24] <codingquark> This can be a good option it seems
[19:50:32] <dale> EdwardIII: This looks totally fine.  Except for that indentation on lines 17--18 which is making me twitch. ;)
[19:50:39] <grym> codingquark: you can torture yourself but good with an erg, yep
[19:50:42] <rpav> grym: treadmill, elliptical, or really anything for cardio .. bicycle machine or whatever
[19:50:58] <rpav> if you live somewhere with 24/7/365 weather 👍 but
[19:51:00] <dale> Treadmill is great during blizzard.
[19:51:01] <grym> with an air/water resistance based machine, you cannot pull harder than it can pull back 
[19:51:01] <rpav> +good
[19:51:06] <rpav> yea
[19:51:11] <grym> and it's a full-body thing
[19:51:14] <raiguy> codingquark: why aren't they safe? no curbs? 
[19:51:14] <rpav> or fall/winter/spring in general ;)
[19:51:28] <grym> so row, do some pushups, stretch, and it's pretty-good-at-least
[19:51:35] <dale> rpav: Hm, do you live somewhere colder or hotter than Chicago? :)
[19:51:51] <grym> raiguy: iirc codingquark lives in india; road quality is i think "variable"
[19:52:04] <codingquark> raiguy: not just "no curbs", roads are either 4 lane highways or shit
[19:52:06] <grym> certainly india has full-dress bike dorks
[19:52:19] <grym> but i suspect the distribution's nonuniform 
[19:52:24] <rpav> dale: madison, so probably not much if at all
[19:52:57] <dale> rpav: Ah, so not a big fan of the colder weather?  Whereas I die when it's above, like, 70 degF>
[19:53:02] <grym> i'll cycle through boston winters without much grumbling, but i find that it's hard to get motivated for a ride unless i have a goal

[19:56:57] <grym> dale: so, on a bike, i'm at least "brisk"
[19:57:14] <grym> i was regularly holding 18-20 mph on the flats for commuting with a pannier 
[19:57:28] <dale> raiguy: When it's really bad I look forward to getting stopped at a traffic light with a subway grate nearby, so I can stand on top and get slightly warmer air blown onto me.
[19:57:33] <grym> i climb like an elephant, but i descend real zippy-like
[19:57:57] <EdwardIII> dale: not offended by my tiny functions to get the attributes out of 'credentials'?
[19:58:08] <grym> my running mile PR is like 08:25 though, so i'm not quick 
[19:58:56] <dale> EdwardIII: I mean, if you want me to be real critical, I guess those names seem likely to end up conflicting with something or confusing you in the future.  And use of set instead of setq there at the bottom is probably non-idiomatic.
[19:59:26] <grym> (and my comfortable rowing pace is about 2:10/500; i can get a lot faster, but not for very long)
[19:59:36] <codingquark> I am completely unhappy with those names, I gotta admit
[19:59:39] <dale> EdwardIII: I'd probably just let-bind it all right there around the set[q] call.  But I wasn't trying to do a full code review. ;)
[19:59:47] <grym> whoops, we're talking about real things again

[20:12:18] <codingquark> "Think of the definition: a pure function is one which can be replaced with its value without affecting the result" - makes sense especially for lisps
[20:12:49] <codingquark> This "construct" named `credentials' should then provide with an API to interact with it

[22:29:53] <aidalgol> I mean, sure, the desktop metaphor can go, but doing away with hierarchical filesystems?
[22:30:08] <Catie> Nope! Just that the directed acyclic graph isn't the only (or necessarily the best) way to organize files
[22:30:15] <artefact> i don't like the discretionary access control however, and that's a real problem with not-so-easy solutions, firejail only gets you so far and selinux is a nightmare

[22:32:22] <Catie> For a lot of information, there are multiple "bins" it could be organized into. But it's difficult under a hierarchical filesystem to (consistently) organize a single file into multiple different directories, especially for people who aren't really any good with computers

[22:36:44] <ryanbw> This discussion makes me think of the development of Windows Longhorn prior to the reset and pivot to what would become Vista.
[22:36:52] <ryanbw> They wanted to use a relational DB instead of a strict file heirarchy.
[22:37:09] <Catie> YEAH I remember reading about that recently

[22:51:35] <pjb> Of course.

[22:52:21] <Catie> pjb: I definitely think that with, for example, a tagged filesystem, it would still have to be people doing the tagging. I don't think this is an area where AI should be applied
[22:52:26] <pjb> In CL we have documentation generators that collect docstrings.  Some of them may expect some kind of formatting or markup in the docstrings.
[22:53:00] <pjb> Catie: the problem is that you'd still want an enumeration operator to be able to retrive ill-tagged files.
[22:53:24] <pjb> it's easier to enumerate subdirectories than flat file system. Remember Finder 1.0!
