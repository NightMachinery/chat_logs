[02:46:07] <sheetjs> its a codebase of theseus situation

[08:18:54] <bnz> Hi all need a bit of help with some webassembly code.. trying to read a binary file and pass the contents to C for manipulation..
[08:19:00] <bnz> can anyone help..
[08:19:05] <bnz> my code https://pastebin.com/mMEKZH7U
[08:20:07] <bnz> the problem is i can pass var tmp = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]; to my function. but when i read a blob and pass the blob to the c function all i get is zeros
[08:21:06] <bnz> i understand i need to pass a pointer of where my data lives on the heap but i cannot get this to work.. every example i find all wants me to use emscripten but thats no good, hello world produces 14K lines of cruft..
[08:22:07] *** Quits: gggp (~textual@60.10.23.172) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[08:23:00] <bnz> I have run out of terms to feed google to see how to change my blob into the right format to pass to my function..
[08:23:49] <bnz> iv'e spent the last four days trying to learn webassembly and i am stuck on passing in useful arrays, my end goal wont allow for hardcoded arrays of data..
[08:25:36] <bnz> can anyone point me to a webassembly channel?
[08:27:22] <bnz> the annoying part of this problem is when i stop the debugger the data all appears correct, what makes me think i have a typecase issue is the debugger shows the arrays differently..
[08:28:13] <bnz> var tmp=[1,2,3,4,5] shows up as a list. data either shows up as a file or arrayBuffer.. cant seem tot find any way to convert between them
[08:30:46] <GreenJello> bnz, you don't seem to be logging 'test'
[08:30:59] <GreenJello> how did you determine it's not working?
[08:32:11] <GreenJello> oh, what is in the .bin file? is it that ascii text in the comment?
[08:32:21] <bnz> if i change my C code to return say all 1's my screen fills with 1's
[08:32:36] <bnz> yup just a comment
[08:32:56] <GreenJello> so there's the ascii byte for a comma between each hex digit?
[08:33:18] <bnz> no just raw numbers no commas

[08:44:07] <bnz> sheetsjs isnt that what line 50 is doing? malloc then line 52 sets and then returns the pointer?

[09:44:42] <GreenJello> bnz, huh, I can't explain why that'd work
[09:45:00] <bnz> thanks GreenJello.... you were very helpful, even if you didnt just spoon feed me the whole answer..
[09:45:27] <bnz> I kinda at that point where i just dont care.. i might just prey that it dont break...
[09:45:46] <bnz> not even sure what made me try it..
[09:47:06] <GreenJello> glad it's working
[09:47:08] <bnz> https://pastebin.com/TwUQBD6r thats the working code...
[09:47:33] <bnz> I have a feeling you're not as glad as me :)
[09:47:59] <bnz> seems like there is some double processing going on..
[09:48:56] <bnz> your structure is much better than the mess i started with :)
[09:50:09] <bnz> i'm very much in the learning phase that i was forced into.. a mate made a simple request that has blown up in proportions..

[09:52:03] <bnz> he asked me to make something that would test his ignition coils on his car.. and that expanded into almost a oscilloscope project.. want to capture data for 1 maybe 2 mins and show useful info about that data.. was looking at a 12min processing time if i used the ESP chip to server sider process the data..
[09:52:44] <bnz> so now i can transfer 20k/s to the client and the client can do all the heave lifting of making the graphics..
[09:53:59] <bnz> 5 days ago when i started this, i though the hard part would be to draw the images of the traces going up and down.. NOPE.. got that done in the first few hours. then spent the next 4 days trying to transfer some data..
[09:54:34] <bnz> thanks GreenJello.. my week is now looking so much more appealing.. :)
[09:55:15] <bnz> i might even get to do something i really enjoy make some hardware :)

[14:31:39] <interop_madness> how do frameworks like Bootstrap detect insertion of DOM nodes with CSS classes that have a special meaning to them? That is, Bootstrap will have to do some JS initialization once an element with a certain Bootstrap class is detected. Is Bootstrap using MutationObserver, or rather, is this the currently best way to do it?

[16:12:45] <teut> hi, I need that "email" state to autochange to something if  it becomes ""
[16:12:53] <teut> what can be done?
[16:14:53] <DPA> DnzAtWrk: No. Not things like fokus and so on, anyway. But HTML checkboxes, radios & inputs have states a form can submit / save. There is also the annoying autofill thing that always keeps getting in the way. It's also possible to encode state in an URL / hashtag to some extent.
[16:15:31] <DnzAtWrk> ah yeah
[16:15:39] <DnzAtWrk> you could probably masquerade a checkbox as something else
[16:16:08] <DPA> You can make them invisible. And you use labels to toggle them.

[16:34:04] <DPA> I did have a system. There are 9 forst moves. For any on the sides, I can go in the middle. If in the middle, I have to pick one on the side. I then copied all the states and filled the next one out again. I already knew which moves are good or bad, there's not that many patterns.
[16:34:04] <DPA> I sometimes reached identical board states & deduped after each move. Was a lot of work, but doable in a night.

[23:41:25] <GreenJello> onosendi, that's presumably text, so you need to escape the other segments
[23:41:27] <teut> you can just keep listening to the typing event
[23:41:32] <GreenJello> when converting it to html
[23:42:13] <teut> as user presses "a key"   you can just put that string in a span
[23:42:45] <onosendi> GreenJello: hmm, not following.
[23:43:01] <teut> i dont know why regex need to be used?
[23:43:22] <onosendi> I get a string back to the server, and `<p>{regexness(detail.content)}</p>`;
[23:43:23] <GreenJello> <script>/* evil */</script> lorem ipsum @onosendi
[23:43:38] *** Joins: Nimzowitsch (~nimzo@user/nimzowitsch)
[23:43:45] <GreenJello> you need to escape the parts that aren't the mention
[23:44:12] <onosendi> GreenJello: the data is sanitized going in to the server.
[23:44:35] <samsch> Well that's wrong :P
[23:44:45] <GreenJello> ^

[23:45:57] <GreenJello> if you end up generating html from it, you handle dangerous sequences for html during the conversion

[23:46:29] <GreenJello> basically doing it as late as possible is ideal
[23:46:41] <samsch> "Just in time" is usually correct, yeah ^
[23:47:05] <GreenJello> if you're using react, you might tokenize it and generate react elements and not need to sanitize it at all
[23:47:19] <ekh> is it possible to catch CORS error using requests made via something like axios?
[23:47:23] <samsch> Insert it into the database "as is", which of course means using the standard injection-safe insertion method (sql query parameters).
[23:47:33] <onosendi> samsch: yeah, def.
[23:47:55] <samsch> Which is also a "just in time" sanitization.

[23:59:33] <GreenJello> yeah, you just map it to something like ['literal text', <span key={1} className="mention">@onosendi</span>, '.']
[23:59:51] <samsch> "just"
