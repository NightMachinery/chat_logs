[06:09:51] <Descartes> I assume the smaller the focal length, the wider the lens, and hence the bigger the aperture, so the more light you're getting and you can use a faster shutter speed
[06:10:51] <Descartes> hence you would have faster, higher fps values?
[06:11:35] <Descartes> and you could get better quality video in low light situations?

[11:51:51] <hiya> Hello. Suggest the most basic yet robust way to download $hash(license_key).conf from server to APK. Because this .conf is enough to connect, no other credentials needed. should we use https server + auth or how does it work? .conf is wg.conf for wg client, once it is downloaded, it won't require any further credentials to connect to vpn server.

[12:48:47] <electr0n> versus your secure_download?
[12:53:28] <electr0n> what I am proposing the user would not have to leave the app potentially ( all depends on how you implement ) but entering license will produce valid config the user only needs to add new conn, scan code, done. Versus, enter license, receive secure download link, download file, import to app.

[14:36:45] <Pickchea> Would the "2" part be satisfied because there's at least two storage devices?

[14:38:04] <corby> If the 3rd PC is at another location then I'd say yes, this counts as 3-2-1
[14:38:46] <corby> Another location as in not the same building.
[14:43:45] <Pickchea> Online sources seem to be conflicting. If "2" refers to "2 storage devices" then it would suffice to use a "3-1 backup" where "3" means "3 copies" and "1" means "1 offsite" because "2 storage devices" is implied as there is clearly no way of having 3 copies on a single devices where one of these copies is offsite. If "2" refers to "2 different types of storage media" then I would have to call it overkill because let's be honest... If you have two
[14:43:45] <Pickchea> copies on two HDDs in your house and one copy on another HDD somewhere remote what are the chances of data loss just because I you used the same device type for all copies?
[14:45:42] <Pickchea> Or in other words, how much data security would you really gain by making one of these storage devices something else than HDD?
