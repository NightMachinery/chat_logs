[08:34:50] <pystardust> JB[m]: ur using gnulinuxindia bouncer and borked?
[08:34:51] <NeoVoid[m]> <labrador> "Neo Void, not my problem" <- dude you are too rude to be here.
[08:34:57] <pystardust> morning guys
[08:36:09] <labrador> NeoVoid[m], like why
[08:36:21] <labrador> I did not say anything wrong tho
[08:36:23] <labrador> but ok
[08:36:26] <labrador> Ill stop
[08:36:53] <Arya[m]> hello
[08:37:06] <pystardust> guys, I think gtlsgamr left the chat cause its getting very immature. Most talks are cringy, talking about "normie", "bloat", "chad" instead of actual learning and spreading gnulinux and foss to a wider audience. No one would be interested to join such a community
[08:38:03] <Arya[m]> gtlsgamr told the same thing to me in pms
[08:38:28] <labrador> Yeah bloat is not right,normie is a cringe 4chan word,and chad is a cringe reddit meme
[08:38:34] <labrador> 100/100 full cringe
[08:39:03] <NeoVoid[m]> pystardust: thats why i tighten the rules
[08:39:20] <NeoVoid[m]> its upon Arya to implement them on matrix side
[08:39:29] <pystardust> try keeping those terms minimal here. you can blabber those maybe in #gnulinuxindia-spam or something like that
[08:39:53] <pystardust> NeoVoid[m]: Arya is one of the main guys who does this, so i doubt it will affect
[08:40:06] <NeoVoid[m]> pystardust: sad
[08:40:10] <labrador> Yeah these just push people from gnu/linux instead of towards it
[08:40:21] <NeoVoid[m]> labrador: its you too
[08:40:23] <Arya[m]> pystardust: lol
[08:40:25] <labrador> But they are fun
[08:40:27] <labrador> to say
[08:40:27] <Arya[m]> do i
[08:40:30] <labrador> soooooooo
[08:40:37] <labrador> NeoVoid[m], ik
[08:40:51] <labrador> I'm reflecting
[08:41:01] <pystardust> dude, you guys don't wanna take it seriously at all, you just do lol for every criticism
[08:41:02] <NeoVoid[m]> its time to install schildi chat
[08:41:41] <pystardust> no one is stopping you from not having that fun, just do it in a offtopic/secondary group
[08:42:26] <labrador> These rules are quite restrictive tho
[08:42:33] <labrador> Even compared to #linux
[08:42:41] <labrador> which has the bullshit no sms rule
[08:42:56] <pystardust> NeoVoid[m]: can you put the rules in a pastebin and send
[08:43:35] <pystardust> labrador: the rule i was mentioning was to reduce the use of the terms "Chad" ... in the chat. Im not telling there is a ban for use and all
[08:43:59] <labrador> ohhhhh
[08:44:00] <labrador> nice
[08:44:02] <labrador> youre a chad
[08:44:33] <pystardust> if i was so i would just ban you
[08:44:44] <labrador> come on now
[08:44:48] <labrador> What did I even do
[08:44:55] <pystardust> these are not rules these are etiquette if you want to get more people into this community
[08:45:15] <Arya[m]> pystardust: is it possible to redirect all traffic from port a to 443 with nginx reverse proxy
[08:45:19] <labrador> Also I feel like this is a fundamental discoonect between the older people in this community and the younger ones
[08:45:41] <labrador> They speak way different
[08:46:06] <pystardust> Arya[m]: yes, it is possible. Do a port 80 reverse proxy and then use certbot itll and redirect
[08:46:20] <Arya[m]> ok
[08:46:43] <pystardust> labrador: its not a about older people its about making the environment friendly to non-linux users so that they also like the community and can spread the message
[08:47:12] * Arya[m] sent a code block: https://libera.ems.host/_matrix/media/r0/download/libera.chat/0102557b2d763a64cdef5fa87058b9a487e88907
[08:47:17] <Arya[m]> does something like this do it?
[08:48:03] <pystardust> yeah looks good, first test if 80 works before trying https
[08:49:07] <pystardust> labrador: if i may ask how old are you? Most of us are young too
[08:49:43] <labrador> I'm a teen
[08:50:05] <pystardust> teen is a variable term, that doesn't tell much
[08:50:14] <NeoVoid[m]> <pystardust> "Neo Void: can you put the..." <- https://pastebin.com/hQS7BrkG
[08:50:26] <labrador> I won't reveal my exact age . tho a teen is 13-18
[08:50:36] <labrador> so like still very pin pointy
[08:51:01] <labrador> pystardust, how old are you?
[08:51:07] <pystardust> looks good NeoVoid[m], what are others opinions on it
[08:52:04] <pystardust> labrador: since you didn't give me any number im also gonna be like im "younger adult"
[08:52:09] <NeoVoid[m]> pystardust: arya said its too restrictive
[08:52:09] <NeoVoid[m]> and labrador said "not my problem"
[08:52:09] <NeoVoid[m]> thats the far recent comment i could get
[08:52:27] <labrador> pystardust, see
[08:52:32] <labrador> still older
[08:53:22] <pystardust> NeoVoid[m]: :(
[08:53:50] <NeoVoid[m]> i doubt @BugsWriter gonna like them.
[08:54:16] <pystardust> hmm, i talked to him about them. We can't help it, the community is toxic

[10:11:23] <Arya[m]> lmao
[10:11:28] <Arya[m]> it was dns issues
[10:11:34] <Arya[m]> switched to gogole dns
[10:11:37] <Arya[m]> from cloudflare
[10:11:40] <labrador> >google
[10:11:45] <Arya[m]> but restarting resolved didnt do anything
[10:11:52] <labrador> ew. Can't you use another dns
[10:11:56] <labrador> Maybe quad9
[10:12:04] <Arya[m]> just temporary
[10:12:10] <labrador> Oh ok
[10:12:13] <labrador> I understand
[10:12:16] <Arya[m]> 1.1.1.1 was my default for a while
[10:12:17] <Arya[m]> on the router
[10:12:27] <labrador> oh
[10:12:36] <labrador> You could also setup your own dns server
[10:12:39] <labrador> As an experient
[10:12:43] <Arya[m]> i did it
[10:12:45] <Arya[m]> pihole
[10:12:47] <labrador> nice
[10:12:50] <Arya[m]> havent fully set it up yet
[10:12:53] <Arya[m]> i have unbound on it
[10:12:59] <Arya[m]> but it isnt working as expected
[10:13:15] <Arya[m]> i will look into it after i get the matrix working as i want it
[10:13:17] <labrador> oh,isnt BIND the defacto dns server?
[10:13:25] <Arya[m]> bind?
[10:13:41] <Arya[m]> unbound is what i have seen used
[10:13:47] <Arya[m]> both on pihole and alpine wiki
[10:13:49] <labrador> I think I'm getting confused
[10:14:16] <root[m]123> yeah
[10:14:18] <root[m]123> probably
[10:15:08] <labrador> BIND (/ˈbaɪnd/) is a suite of software for interacting with the Domain Name System (DNS). Its most prominent component, named (pronounced name-dee: /ˈneɪmdiː/, short for name daemon), performs both of the main DNS server roles, acting as an authoritative name server for DNS zones and as a recursive resolver in the network. As of 2015, it is the most widely used domain name server software,
[10:15:12] <labrador> No I was actually right
[10:15:16] <labrador> This from wiki
[10:15:50] <labrador> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BIND
[11:22:41] <Arya[m]> yes
[11:22:41] <Tor[m]> I think setting up xmpp and than bridging it with matrix would be easier on resources
[11:22:41] <Tor[m]> It was a question as luke smith prefers xmpl over matrix as it uses less resources
[11:22:43] <Arya[m]> but i prefer matrix
[11:25:41] *** Joins: purpux (~PurPux@user/purpux)
[11:32:06] <labrador> i like both
[11:32:24] <labrador> matrix proocol is fine
[11:32:50] <labrador> the server tho is written a bad language for servers
[11:32:59] <labrador> thats why its so slow
[11:33:07] <labrador> and memory hungry
[11:34:53] <labrador> also lukesmith is a troll
[11:36:47] <Arya[m]> dendrite
[11:36:50] <Arya[m]> i will try dendrite later
[11:36:55] <Arya[m]> its way better
[11:36:58] <Arya[m]> and its rust
[11:38:13] <labrador> yeah
[11:38:28] <labrador> the protocol is nice,but not mature
[11:38:33] <pystardust> labrador: xmpp is nice too, even tho it doesn't have such flashy features, its very very lightweight to spin up and is federated like matrix
[11:39:15] <pystardust> I hosted it on my previous server and it barely took ~50-100mb of ram
[11:39:34] <labrador> which sever pystardust 
[11:39:39] <labrador> prosody?
[11:39:57] <pystardust> yes

[12:35:05] <iamak[m]> No no. I meant what's the benefit of using a bridge over installing the app in a profile like shelter (i have did this)
[12:35:15] <iamak[m]> pystardust: Quicksy or sth from F-Droid
[12:35:46] <pystardust> hmm, isn't it more simpler than matrix. It does chats to dms very minimally
[12:35:54] <Arya[m]> i can use one app
[12:35:56] <Arya[m]> for everything
[12:36:19] <pal[m]> iamak[m]: Another step to getting away from all these proprietary apps
[12:36:45] <pal[m]> Like I would love to delete whatsapp but a lot of my college communication takes place over there
[12:37:03] <pal[m]> So this is a nice compromise I feel, instead of using the app directly
[12:37:40] <pystardust> hey pal[m], hows life? exams over i hope
[12:38:01] <pal[m]> Lol I'm doing great
[12:38:09] <pal[m]> I had gone for vacation
[12:38:35] <pal[m]> So still haven't gone back to normal lol
[12:38:50] <pal[m]> I've got my networking viva rn
[12:39:00] <pal[m]> Wbu @pystardust
[12:39:25] <pystardust> pal[m]: just came back to college offline, and im already a corona first contact, in isolation
[12:39:46] <pal[m]> Bruh that's so unfortunate
[12:39:51] <pystardust> networking viva, sounds fun
[12:40:05] <pystardust> do they ask about the differnt layers and all huh
[12:40:06] <pal[m]> Hehe would have been if I had prepared smth
[12:40:12] <pystardust> sad
[12:40:26] <pal[m]> Nah mostly stuff about wireshark and cisco packet tracer
[12:40:47] <pal[m]> And a lil about diff networking commands
[12:41:00] <pal[m]> I have completely forgotten everything I did this sem
[12:41:11] <pal[m]> So let's see how this goes
[12:41:28] <pystardust> all the best!
[12:41:46] <pal[m]> You said you're in isolation, so that means you're back home or in some hospital?
[12:41:53] <pal[m]> Thanks!
[12:42:05] <pystardust> isolated in my hostel room
[12:42:18] <pal[m]> Ahhh
[12:42:24] <pal[m]> How many more days?
[12:42:39] <pystardust> 3-4 days
[12:42:48] <pal[m]> Oh alright
[12:45:01] <pal[m]> Ait ill be back after my viva is done
[12:46:38] <Arya[m]> gws pystatdust
[12:46:50] <Arya[m]> another experience to make me not go offline \xD
[12:47:17] <pystardust> thnks Arya[m] 
[12:47:34] <pystardust> im not affected, I dont' have symptoms, but im in isolation so that i don't spread it
[12:48:48] <iamak[m]> <pystardust> "hmm, isn't it more simpler..." <- The ui is very outdated imo. ~8-10 years behind modern ui
[12:49:48] <iamak[m]> <pal[m]> "So this is a nice compromise I..." <- Shelter isolates the app from other apps. How does bridge isolate it?
[12:53:11] <Arya[m]> <pal[m]> "Like I would love to delete..." <- use matrix bridge
[12:53:20] <Arya[m]> its pretty easy to setup if you aldready have a server running
[12:53:37] <pal[m]> Yeah I am planning to
[12:53:44] <pal[m]> What are you hosting it on?
[12:53:47] <Arya[m]> i did it 
[12:53:50] <Arya[m]> my old pc
[12:53:56] <pal[m]> Ohhh
[12:53:57] <Arya[m]> i had to go through a lot of hoope
[12:54:01] <Arya[m]> to get argo working tho
[12:54:04] <Arya[m]> as i cant PF
[12:54:18] <pal[m]> I don't have an extra pc laying around so I'll need to get a vps
[12:54:36] <Arya[m]> it doesnt need to be that powerful
[12:54:57] <Arya[m]> you can host it on an rpi like Govindas or host it on a potato pc like me
[12:55:18] <Arya[m]> i am hosting it on an lxc container which is on my proxmox which is running on an i3 6th gen with 8 gigs ram
[12:55:34] <Arya[m]> the container has just 2 gigs and one thread 
[12:56:13] <Arya[m]> its just using 600 megabytes ram tho
[12:56:17] <Arya[m]> on rockylinux
[13:40:49] <AnkanRoy[m]> > <Neo Void> For those on IRC... (full message at https://libera.ems.host/_matrix/media/r0/download/libera.chat/ca647d8db028bba3b83b100e8016af8285452106)
[13:41:19] <Aryan[m]> AnkanRoy[m]: sus
[13:42:00] <AnkanRoy[m]> Aryan[m]: heeeeee
[13:42:35] <labrador> Lets talk about browsers
[13:42:49] <labrador> What browsers do all of you use?
[13:42:59] <Arya[m]> firefox for normal browsing
[13:43:04] <labrador> nice
[13:43:09] <Arya[m]> brave for school
[13:43:17] <Arya[m]> / meetings
[13:43:29] <labrador> hmm
[13:43:31] <labrador> why tho?
[13:43:33] <labrador> just asking
[13:45:24] <Aryan[m]> Google meet works better on chromium based browsers
[13:45:43] <labrador> oh
[13:46:36] <AnkanRoy[m]> labrador: uC browser 😝
[13:46:39] <labrador> Arya[m], is your ff hardened?
[13:47:05] <labrador> AnkanRoy[m], Lmao yeah,chinese spy browser too
[13:47:11] <iamak[m]> Has anyone used an IRC bouncer here? I want to set it up on my RPi
[13:47:27] <iamak[m]> s/used/setup/
[13:47:29] <Arya[m]> labrador: idts
[13:47:33] <Arya[m]> ig i did harden it a bit
[13:47:36] <Arya[m]> but then left it
[13:47:38] <Arya[m]> lol
[13:47:41] <labrador> hmm
[13:47:45] <Arya[m]> Aryan[m]: yup
[13:47:51] <labrador> you can use librewolf
[13:48:14] <iamak[m]> Aryan[m]: Is it a useragent thing lol? or actual performance thing?
[13:48:21] <labrador> its on the aur too
[13:48:25] <labrador> as librewolf-bin
[13:48:40] <labrador> Its a prehardened and de-telemtrified ff
[13:48:49] <labrador> Basically ungoogled chromium but for ff
[13:48:55] <labrador> You might like it
[13:49:36] <labrador> user agent and performance both iamak[m] 
[13:50:02] <labrador> google slows down their websites on browsers other than chrome
[13:50:32] <labrador> And chromium supports some more apis than firefox
[13:51:47] <iamak[m]> labrador: This won't be a problem. I rarely use Google websites and I broadcast a Chrome Windows UA anyways
[13:52:01] <root[m]123> successfully migrated to postgres on my homeserver
[13:52:20] <labrador> iamak[m], please dont do that
[13:52:24] <labrador> Unless you use tor
[13:52:31] <iamak[m]> Why
[13:52:38] <labrador> That makes it much easier to fingerprint you
[13:52:54] <labrador> The blink rendering engine is quite different to gecko
[13:53:00] <labrador> actaully quantum now
[13:53:02] <iamak[m]> Ah
[13:53:14] <labrador> Their differences are more than just the useragent
[13:53:18] <iamak[m]> So it checks the UA and the engine and fingerprints me
[13:53:33] <iamak[m]> I will broadcast FF and Windows then xD
[13:53:48] <iamak[m]> This won't be detected na/
[13:53:50] <iamak[m]> s///?/
[13:53:54] <labrador> So basically you're the only weirdo broadcasting a chrome+windows UA but actually a firefox+linux combination
[13:54:04] <labrador> more easier to track
[13:54:07] <iamak[m]> Yeah samjha
[13:54:18] <iamak[m]> What about Win + FF?
[13:54:29] <iamak[m]> Is that also detectable?
[13:54:44] <labrador> na,unless you wanna bypass locks,let the UA change  be handled by someone experienced
[13:54:57] <iamak[m]> Oh alright
[13:54:57] <labrador> like tor
[13:55:11] <labrador> they broadcast ff+wi 10
[13:55:14] <labrador> win*
[13:55:18] <iamak[m]> I rarely use Tor
[13:55:27] <labrador> u should use it
[13:55:28] <iamak[m]> Many websites block it
[13:56:07] <iamak[m]> I know I should but I hate to switch to LW/FF everytime a website breaks
[13:56:26] <labrador> man,security is annoying
[13:56:36] <labrador> not a lot can be done about that
[13:57:18] <iamak[m]> Hardening is also weird
[13:57:25] <labrador> why?
[13:57:34] <iamak[m]> The more you harden your browser, the more unique you become
[13:57:50] <iamak[m]> Because not everyone has hardened their browser
[13:57:54] <labrador> kind of yeah,again,unless you use tor
[13:57:57] <iamak[m]> Especially not the common people
[13:58:09] <labrador> but the gain is more
[13:58:26] <iamak[m]> I try to convince people but they like the convenience 
[13:58:51] <labrador> essentially the site knowing "hmm,this guy is not being fingerprinted" is better than the site fingerprinting you
[13:59:15] <iamak[m]> Yeah 
[14:01:27] <iamak[m]> What all extensions do you guys use in your browsers?
[14:01:38] <iamak[m]> I use uBlock + Privacy Badger
[14:01:54] <labrador> uh
[14:02:05] <labrador> dont use privacy badger
[14:02:13] <labrador> its of no use with ublock
[14:02:23] <labrador> Also I hope you refer to origin
[14:02:35] <iamak[m]> Origin?
[14:02:42] <labrador> ublock origin
[14:02:51] <labrador> this one?
[14:02:56] <iamak[m]> labrador: It blocks some stuff which uBlock doesn't
[14:02:57] <labrador> or ublock
[14:02:57] <iamak[m]> labrador: Yes
[14:03:04] <iamak[m]> uBlock Origin
[14:03:11] <labrador> ok ok good
[14:03:13] <iamak[m]> 2 version hai kya
[14:03:37] <labrador> 1 is bad
[14:03:42] <labrador> 1 is good
[14:03:59] <iamak[m]> F. Origin good na?
[14:04:05] <labrador> yea
[14:04:08] <iamak[m]> :whew:
[14:04:24] <labrador> ublock was hijacked
[14:04:37] <iamak[m]> Ah
[14:04:44] <labrador> the og dev made ubo then
[14:05:16] <iamak[m]> Happens a lot with FOSS stuff
[14:07:09] <labrador> https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock
[14:07:14] <labrador> maybe go take a visit
[14:07:15] *** Joins: ramram (~ramram@106.79.200.155)
[14:09:28] <iamak[m]> Nice
[14:10:35] <labrador> iamak[m], what distro you use?
[14:11:14] <iamak[m]> Arch (btw)
[14:11:20] <labrador> oh nice
[14:11:43] <labrador> i'm a noob compared to you then
[14:11:54] <iamak[m]> I assumed most people here use Arch based on the discussions
[14:11:58] <iamak[m]> labrador: Lol why
[14:12:18] <labrador> nope,i use debian
[14:12:33] <labrador> iamak[m], cause i use easy distro
[14:12:43] <iamak[m]> Eh
[14:12:49] <iamak[m]> Ye kya logic hai
[14:12:53] <iamak[m]> xD
[14:13:14] <iamak[m]> It takes me 10 mins to use something new with Arch
[14:13:30] <iamak[m]> Just because you don't use Arch doesn't mean you are a noob
[14:13:48] <labrador> you're learning though. Debian kinda caps you out on that. And also irc.
[14:14:07] <labrador> once i started using irc i didnt even need to learn to solve my own problems
[14:14:10] <labrador> its easier
[14:14:13] <labrador> but no growth
[14:15:08] <iamak[m]> > once i started using irc i didnt even need to learn to solve my own problems
[14:15:08] <iamak[m]> Why
[14:15:28] <labrador> because somebody who solved his problems the hard way just guided me thorugh it
[14:16:06] <iamak[m]> Ah
[14:16:13] <iamak[m]> Didn't know IRC was this activ
[14:16:14] <iamak[m]> s/activ/active/
[14:16:26] <iamak[m]> All the irc rooms I joined so far are dead ;_;
[14:16:54] <iamak[m]> Also it's difficult to use on phone (imo)
[14:17:07] <labrador> I don't really use irc on phones
[14:17:18] <labrador> I kinda actually hate my phone
[14:17:27] <labrador> Its not free like my laptop
[14:17:42] <iamak[m]> Use LOS?
[14:17:54] <labrador> its a samsung
[14:18:02] <labrador> no chance
[14:18:18] <labrador> I am not running windows once to use a leaked copy of odin
[14:18:19] <iamak[m]> Lol never used a samsung
[14:18:31] <labrador> and heimdall never supported my deivce
[14:18:39] <iamak[m]> I use 5 year old Moto because it helps me bypass safety net
[14:18:47] <labrador> oh
[14:18:50] <labrador> nice
[14:18:56] <iamak[m]> labrador: VM?
[14:19:14] <labrador> I could try
[14:19:27] <labrador> the problem would be finding odin
[14:19:45] <iamak[m]> Just download it on a friend's (who doesn't use FOSS) computer
[14:19:51] <iamak[m]> labrador: XDA?
[14:19:54] <labrador> odin cannot be downloaded
[14:20:02] <labrador> Its leaked samsung internal software
[14:20:13] <labrador> you'll find it on weirder sites
[14:20:14] <iamak[m]> Ah
[14:20:20] <labrador> but who knows if its malware
[14:21:17] <iamak[m]> F
[14:23:16] <labrador> I really like irc for one reason
[14:23:20] <labrador> Its like a command line
[14:23:35] <labrador> you can command directly from the chat
[14:23:49] <labrador> like /part #gnulinuxindia 
[14:23:51] <iamak[m]> Yes which is why it is difficult to use on phone lol
[14:24:08] <labrador> I guess yeah
[14:24:30] <labrador> I feel like phones are the reason people started becoming afraid of computers
[14:24:38] <labrador> That and proprietary software
[14:25:11] <labrador> Like yesterday zoom failed for "some reason" for an entire hour
[14:25:20] <labrador> Missed a class
[14:25:31] <labrador> No way to fix it,no way to know what caused it
[14:25:59] <labrador> No wonder people think computers are fragile beings where even doing one thing out of step will break the entire thing
[14:26:40] <iamak[m]> Phones UI makes it easier to use the device
[14:26:48] <iamak[m]> Which is the whole reason phone UI is designed
[14:27:44] <iamak[m]> It is designed keeping in mind normal people who don't know how to search online for errors and don't want to fix them
[14:27:53] <iamak[m]> They want something which just works
[14:31:23] <labrador> But in the end that doesn't even matterrrr. Abstractions are leaky.
[14:31:39] <labrador> And when you are faced with a leak when you don't know how to deal with it
[14:31:44] <labrador> The results are way worse
[14:31:55] <labrador> Phones also dont give root
[14:40:54] <iamak[m]> <labrador> "But in the end that doesn't even..." <- Common people don't care about this
[14:41:02] <iamak[m]> <labrador> "Phones also dont give root" <- Or this
[14:41:10] <iamak[m]> Also I hate to think what noobs would do with root
[14:41:51] <labrador> People need root
[14:41:55] <labrador> To have freedom
[14:42:19] <iamak[m]> Yes but
[14:42:33] <iamak[m]> They will also ruin their stuff with root
[14:42:41] <iamak[m]> Do you not know the leaky patcher thing?
[14:42:51] <labrador> But thats fine
[14:42:57] <iamak[m]> People patched everything with leaky patcher to avoid ads
[14:43:02] <labrador> They have freedom to ruin their systems
[14:43:05] <iamak[m]> Ended up installing malware
[14:43:10] <labrador> lmao
[14:43:25] <iamak[m]> labrador: People won't buy the product if the system is easily ruined
[14:43:31] <iamak[m]> Easy as that
[14:43:34] <labrador> hmmm
[14:43:39] <iamak[m]> I am not saying that don' allow people to root
[14:43:43] <labrador> But linux is also easily ruined
[14:43:54] <labrador> Because it gives you root
[14:44:00] <iamak[m]> I am just saying that they aren't educated enough to handle root
[14:44:10] <iamak[m]> labrador: And how many normal people can use it properly?
[14:44:17] <labrador> iamak[m], good point
[14:44:22] <iamak[m]> Linux from LTT broke his DE
[14:44:28] <iamak[m]> 😂
[14:44:31] <labrador> Yeah but it should be a simple on/off switch in dev options tho
[14:44:40] <labrador> Not the weird things we have to do
[14:58:48] * Bot[m]12 uploaded an image: (31KiB) < https://libera.ems.host/_matrix/media/r0/download/t2bot.io/6b2fe998399f029c550d7843e4c5006ef589abb4/image.jpeg >
[14:58:48] <Bot[m]12> Hey anybody can tell how i can run this script in startup
[14:59:01] <Bot[m]12> s/script/command/
[15:00:22] <labrador> At what point in the startup?
[15:00:37] <Bot[m]12> Because i installed spotify from snap and it don't run in startup so i neend to run every time this command in terminal when i start my system
[15:01:49] <Bot[m]12> So where i can put this command, for auto start
[15:02:02] <Bot[m]12> I'm using kali with xfce desktop environment and bspwm as Windows manager
[15:02:14] <Bot[m]12> help me guys
[15:02:58] <Bot[m]12> I tried to put in .xprofile and it's not working
[15:04:17] <NeoVoid[m]> Bot[m]12: in xfce you can use session and startup option
[15:05:02] <labrador> man
[15:05:11] <labrador> youre doing all sorts of wrong things
[15:05:23] <labrador> Why are you installing spotify in kali?
[15:05:24] <smud[m]> oh boy sudo command on startup
[15:05:33] <labrador> Thats only for working
[15:06:07] <labrador> Secondly replacing apparmor policies with one specified by snap
[15:06:11] <labrador> not a good idea too
[15:06:20] <NeoVoid[m]> goto xfce settings » session and startup » Application Autostart Tab » plus button in bottom left corner » put name » command » and trigger "on login"
[15:06:35] <Bot[m]12> Ohk
[15:07:11] <NeoVoid[m]> labrador: can you clearify whats wrong he is doing exactly?
[15:07:14] <NeoVoid[m]> plz elaborate
[15:07:22] <labrador> NeoVoid[m], I don't think that what he is doing is actually sane
[15:07:28] <labrador> That will cause security problems
[15:07:49] <NeoVoid[m]> i am not snap or apparmor user so i dont know particular about it
[15:08:06] <labrador> These are security solutions
[15:08:14] <labrador> Do not fickle around with apparmor
[15:08:15] <NeoVoid[m]> labrador: what the sane way then plz explain him
[15:08:18] <labrador> Unless needed
[15:08:58] <NeoVoid[m]> labrador: can you just tell him how to autostart that command in startup?
[15:09:26] <labrador> I could,but don't we have to ensure he knows what hes doing?
[15:09:38] <labrador> Like installing spotify in kali
[15:09:42] <Bot[m]12> labrador: Man I'm very new to linux, i don't know this deep to any service
[15:09:49] <labrador> Yeah,see NeoVoid[m] 
[15:09:59] <labrador> Don't start explaining what he means
[15:10:11] <labrador> *says
[15:10:28] <labrador> Do what he means. kali is not a distro to be putting spotify on
[15:10:46] <labrador> And is new to linux so possibly does not even understand what apparmor
[15:10:52] <labrador> is or what command hes running
[15:10:57] <NeoVoid[m]> labrador: yeah man. why bother helping a newbie instead of wasting the time and energy about gossiping LTT shit.
[15:11:19] <NeoVoid[m]> you could use your skill in helping people who are new at linux.
[15:11:53] <Bot[m]12> labrador: Who don't use spotify on his system
[15:12:04] <labrador> Man,you're giving out wrong advice to a person that does not know what hes doing? To Bot[m]12 ,kali is a distro used for pentesting and hacking. Don't use it as a regular distro
[15:12:22] <labrador> It runs stuff as root that should not
[15:12:24] <NightFury[m]> Hey can't we startup Spotify as we keep plank or docky in startups
[15:12:31] <Bot[m]12> labrador: It's stable that's why I'm using
[15:12:36] <labrador> uhhhhh
[15:12:47] <labrador> No,its a specialized distro
[15:12:52] <labrador> Please use debian
[15:12:55] <labrador> or unbuntu
[15:12:58] <labrador> ubuntu*
[15:13:02] <NeoVoid[m]> labrador: so you saying we cant do regular computing on a hacking machine?
[15:13:11] <labrador> for a stable desktop machine
[15:13:15] <Bot[m]12> labrador: It just a debian, with pre-installed pentesting tool
[15:13:29] <vipul[m]> Bot[m]12: Nope
[15:13:32] <labrador> It works differnetly to debian.
[15:13:38] <labrador> Its based on it however
[15:13:48] <labrador> Its not just debian+apt install x,y,z
[15:13:51] <NeoVoid[m]> labrador: kali is based upon ubuntu whats wrong with you lol
[15:14:15] <NeoVoid[m]> so you are distro expert then 😂
[15:14:17] <NightFury[m]> NightFury[m]: ..?
[15:14:22] <labrador> Okay fine,still my point remains.Don't nitpick
[15:14:43] <labrador> Kali Linux is a Debian-derived Linux distribution designed for digital forensics and penetration testing. It is maintained and funded by Offensive Security.
[15:14:46] <labrador> Also you wrong
[15:14:52] <labrador> Now dont feel butthurt about it
[15:15:02] <NeoVoid[m]> NightFury[m]: plank and dock have inbuilt functionality to put them in startup i dont use stotify so cant tell about it.
[15:15:20] <NightFury[m]> NeoVoid[m]: Ohh okay
[15:16:03] <NeoVoid[m]> labrador: just because some distro designed for particular usecase doesnt mean they cant do other stuff too.
[15:16:29] <Bot[m]12> NeoVoid[m]: Exactly man
[15:16:50] <NeoVoid[m]> labrador: and thats the language of guild members.
[15:17:14] <NeoVoid[m]> labrador: you are so getting banned today.
[15:17:14] <NeoVoid[m]> i am so done with you.
[15:17:36] <NeoVoid[m]> @pystardust you are seeing this right
[15:17:42] <root[m]123> <labrador> "the problem would be finding..." <- waydroid 4 life
[15:17:51] <labrador> I am ok with it. You are giving out such bad advice? Use a distro made for pentesting you say?
[15:18:06] <labrador> Maybe I thought you were more competent
[15:18:14] <labrador> than you actually are
[15:18:50] <root[m]123> damn i got pinged so many times because my username is root 
[15:18:55] <labrador> lmao

[15:27:49] <labrador> This is like the first time I'm being banned for right advice lmao
[15:28:03] <labrador> .....Firsts all the way
[15:28:08] <NeoVoid[m]> good. I am sorry for the drama.
[15:28:08] <NeoVoid[m]> but hard decision has to be taken by someone.
[15:28:45] <labrador> NeoVoid[m], I just hope you tell Bot[m]12 the truth,its a very bad idea to use kali for normal work.
[15:29:22] <NeoVoid[m]> if you still have some self respect you will leave labrador from irc. dont wait to be banned.
[15:29:32] <labrador> Eh I wanna see it tbh
