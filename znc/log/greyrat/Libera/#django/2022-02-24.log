[03:10:35] <FunkyBob> cookie
[03:11:05] <d1rewolf> FunkyBob: probably not. I've just followed this tutorial to a tee
[03:11:37] <d1rewolf> I'm a django newb (like this is the eighth time I've flirted with django) and a front-end newb, but experienced on the backend
[03:11:47] <d1rewolf> but more java and rails than django
[03:11:57] <FunkyBob> sure
[03:12:26] <FunkyBob> so, in a 'traditional' app, django would set the CSRF cookie when a template is rendered wit ht he csrf token...
[03:12:31] <FunkyBob> or you mark a view to explicitly set it
[03:13:01] <FunkyBob> I tend to wrap the "get user" API endpoint that checks if a user is logged in in the decorator that will ensure the csrf token is set
[03:13:49] <FunkyBob> I cover it here - https://blog.tinbrain.net/blog/session-auth-spa.html
[03:14:05] <FunkyBob> hmm... need to update my markdown renderer to include IDs in headers...

[03:30:49] <d1rewolf> FunkyBob: got it. thanks.

[09:28:01] *** Joins: dor (~erg@188.147.4.62.nat.umts.dynamic.t-mobile.pl)
[09:34:11] <schinckel> Sure thing. It’s just python code. You can write code that imports the classes as long as django can access the settings.
[09:34:19] <schinckel> What specifically did you need to do?
[09:35:02] <fikran> so, as this project expands, we are writing a daemon that runs on a target machine that sends data back in JSON form
[09:35:21] <fikran> Since the application is written first and foremost in Django, it owns the DB.
[09:35:34] <fikran> Wonder how I could interface with it.
[09:35:44] <fikran> the Daemon code will be written in Go (most likely)
[09:35:49] <schinckel> You can have workers that access django models - we do this with celery.
[09:35:55] <schinckel> Oh, not python.
[09:36:13] <schinckel> You _could_ have something that interacts with the database directly, but that can be problematic.
[09:36:26] <schinckel> Especially if you have lots of logic/validation in django code.
[09:37:08] <fikran> I don't mind having an intermediate layer, that's fine.
[09:37:37] <fikran> ideally I would have a stand-alone daemon that gets the data from the Go application and interacts/interfaces with the DB.

[09:57:41] <FunkyBob> it works quite well
[09:58:55] <FunkyBob> the only significant thing you need to know is the ORM was sort of built around having requests, so it wants a cleanup call to be invoked perodically
[09:59:10] <FunkyBob> the cleanup checks that connections are good, and recycles them if they're old or broken

[19:33:46] <bparker> here it says that one can use hasattr() to check the existence of an associated OneToOneField: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/topics/db/examples/one_to_one/
[19:34:32] <bparker> but it is not working for me, it returns true because the attribute exists but is set to None

[20:05:11] <timkofu> Is there a way to group models within an app?
[20:05:20] <timkofu> In-built way
[20:05:33] <hylje> group in what sense?
[20:05:36] <timkofu> This is on the admin interface
[20:06:15] <bparker> wintrmute: yea, you just use normal regex capture groups
[20:06:22] <hylje> admin will group models by app, but to have more elaborate control over that i think you'd have to modify admin code
[20:06:27] <bparker> like foo/(\d+)/(\d+)/
[20:06:36] <hylje> so nothing inbuilt that i'm aware of
[20:06:38] <bparker> will call the view foo(request, var, var2)
