[07:46:47] <rahl> After some more discussion, it's looking like it /could/ be a mutt bug, but I'm still not 100%
[07:47:00] <rahl> I'll get back to you as I find more

[08:41:50] <rahl> kevin8t8: ah, cool. Let me know what you discover
[08:45:09] <kevin8t8> I've just pushed a quick fix to branch 
[08:45:09] <kevin8t8> kevin/rahl-term-segv
[08:45:39] <kevin8t8> don't have time to play with it more tonight (it's Christmas eve), but I believe this is the bug.
[08:46:23] <kevin8t8> I'll try to test it more tomorrow/this weekend and will include the fix in the next stable release.
[08:47:15] <rahl> kevin8t8: Much appreciated.
[08:47:42] <rahl> And no stress :) have a great christmas
[08:48:29] <kevin8t8> rahl: you too.  thanks for reporting the problem and researching the cause.  that helped a lot.
[08:50:43] <rahl> Thanks. tis the least I could do - and tbf you did all the hard work (I'd only just now set up a NetBSD VM to start testing myself)

[12:25:45] <rahl> But that is only in the VM, not the original system with original problem
[12:27:33] <rahl> Sorry, might not be a hang - `ps` shows no mutt running, might just be that curses screws the tty - not sure but looking like a separate problem for later

[21:57:15] <kevin8t8> rahl: the test branch fixed a segv bug for sure, so it's interesting it crashing at that line.  doesn't make sense, but I'll look more this weekend.

[22:34:27] <kevin8t8> rahl: lol found another bug in the same comparison loop.  that was hiding the segv fix from yesterday.
[22:35:47] <kevin8t8> rahl: but your line number in curs_main.c:159 hints that tigetstr() is returning an invalid pointer. again, I'll work on getting a vm setup later, but if that's the case it's a NetBSD bug...
