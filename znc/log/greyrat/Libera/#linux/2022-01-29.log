[00:02:45] <exfalso> Hi, I'm trying to load an out-of-tree driver. It's a misc driver, insmod returns fine, I see the "taint" message in dmesg. However the driver is not actually loaded, /proc/misc doesn't contain an entry for it. I'm thinking it's some kind of error, but I don't know how to debug further. Any hints?
[00:02:54] <ayecee> Intelo: seems like you've got the best then.
[00:03:00] <Yotha> peetaur: ok got it ;)
[00:03:14] <mrfb> sathylias: go back to 5.15 or check which is the latest supposed "good" working kernel

[03:15:56] <Gaboradon> SymbioticFemale: Diversion is a DIY community made fancy script that works as a program inside Entware, Entware is a script platform what works on router firmwares such as AsusWRT-Merlin, which comes on the latest AX routers preinstalled, it does not come preinstalled on the official AsusWRT firmwares by ASUS. You can't run this on PC, you need a Router with supported FW and Entware and then you can install Diversion, and configure it to block anything
[03:15:58] <Gaboradon> you want, any dns request, that's standard, then you have what is called pixel-tls which is more advanced and can block HTTPS stuff, for ads and I think DoH, DNS over HTTPS. I didn't bother with HTTPS yet so I just make sure programs don't have DoH enabled.

[03:22:04] <Gaboradon> SymbioticFemale: Then you'd have to flash the custom -Merlin FW, and recent versions of Merlin have actually "amtm" preinstalled, then that installs entware and diversion (diversion needs entware) and entware needs an external disk connected to the router at all times, such as a USB Flash Stick, but I had 2 of them die on me in some months because logging and stuff hammers flash so I just bought a 250GB Sata SSD with USB3 to Sata adapter, it only needs

[06:30:22] <znf> a "webserver" is a piece of software that serves data, preferably over the HTTP/x protocol, but not restricted (ie: websockets!)

[06:33:58] <MrBurns> znf: so to repeat myself the project folder has to be symlinked to home folder so vscode can access and write to it. But that is not the problem. The problem is that for some reason apache is not following the symlink. And the symlimk is working. So there must be some access right issues or some config issues.

[12:22:41] <raxor2k> ok guys, here is the strange thing: I have 2 separate droplets created in digital ocean. Both of them have same resources. In each of them i am running a python restapi and both of them have the exact same code. When i perform a getlink on ofe of them, it takes me 1 second to retreieve the data, but on the other one i could take up to 10 seconds! I assume there are some programs/resources that
[12:22:41] <raxor2k> is taking alot of cpu or memory in this server, anyone here with suggestions on how i can investigate this?

[12:23:30] <raxor2k> so, all of the commands (both in docker, and in python pip) are 100% identical. And also the python project and code is 100% identical
[12:23:49] <tuxinator> raxor2k: Do they both run on different VM's or Physical machines? a Cluster from digitalocean? As a Service?

[14:59:17] <labrador> hexnewbie, also the only time the gpl hurts is when you want to make something proprietary. I think thats fine.
[14:59:28] <schuelermine> Doesn't the GPL explicitly talk about "source code" as opposed to binary code? How could that apply to images?

[15:01:11] <labrador> If something is public domain then you cannot really talk about licenses
[15:01:43] <hexnewbie> labrador: Not true. Copyleft can prevent two software projects from using each other's code. One is if two copyleft licenses are involved (GPL & CDDL is the canonical example, with ZFS in Linux still being alien), but also a library that needs to be permissively licensed cannot use GPL code, either
[15:01:58] <schuelermine> labrador: The GPL can hurt if you need to integrate closed-source things for convenience. Also, v3 restricts distribution by context incl. hardware, which can be problematic

[15:19:42] <domicron> The really weird thing about the militant GPL types is that, they conveniently forget how the computer industry we know is entirely founded on the notion of unimaginable riches gained from the technology to be invented

[15:20:24] <labrador> ok sure computer hardware is covered by copyrights
[15:20:41] <hexnewbie> mrfb: Still, it did coincide with the invention of print, because the printing press made publishers too powerful. Both CC and FSF have been arguing that its current versions are making publishers even *more* powerful.

[17:49:35] <NthDegree> in theory a Linux distro could use a similar approach to what Apple does with swappiness set to 100 and low RAM being supplemented by fast SSD (maybe zswap rather than zram?)

[19:10:07] <spyroboy> ye. just didn't realize it included things waiting on I/O.
[19:10:18] <hexnewbie> If only a) is true, you can probably call it “CPU demand” or something of the sort, but I'm sure some wise person would apply that to the new PSI stats

[19:20:13] <arkanoid> I have a file literally named '~' in my home, I fear deleting my home with rm, how to delete it via terminal?
[19:20:26] <ayecee> rm -- ~
[19:20:35] <spyroboy> looking for something above source code but below distribution level documentation, msiism.
[19:20:38] <ayecee> or rm ./~
[19:20:53] <spyroboy> for example, the way tasks are counted and the way load average is calculated is universal across all linux systems.
[19:20:54] <arkanoid> thanks!
[19:21:07] <msiism> Isn't rm not able to remove directories anyway?
[19:21:15] <spyroboy> but I suppose distribution level documentation covers that.
[19:21:16] <msiism> I mean, without `-r`.
[19:21:21] <Takios> msiism: yes
[19:21:35] <msiism> So, why could you not just give it the tilde as the first argument?
[19:21:43] <Takios> no
[19:21:45] <spyroboy> arkanoid, use '~'
[19:21:49] <Takios> the shell will expand it
[19:21:52] <ayecee> msiism: because it wouldn't delete the file
[19:21:53] <spyroboy> with the single quotes.
[19:22:08] <spyroboy> if it's not a directory, don't use -r.
[19:22:24] <msiism> But then, how does `-- ~` prevent shell expansion?
[19:22:30] <spyroboy> it does not.

[23:51:38] <derpadmin> the open source driver is no bueno, and the proprietary driver only support specific distro of old versions of linux
[23:51:54] <derpadmin> soimething got removed from the linux headers in kernel 5.5
[23:52:07] <matsaman> derpadmin: no, you can use the proprietary driver with any distro
[23:52:19] <matsaman> but it's true you could be tied to old sources if you don't want to update anything personally
[23:52:32] <derpadmin> ok matsaman, I give you the card for free, you make it work and I give you 20$
[23:52:41] <matsaman> heh
[23:52:46] <matsaman> probably wouldn't cover shipping
[23:52:50] <matsaman> hang on

[23:57:28] <TheSilentLink> Anyone know what the difference is between xhci_hcd.quirks=270336 and xhcd_hcd.quirks=270336? (apart from the letter). The latter works for me but the former doesn't. Online I see xhci_hcd.quirks=270336 mentioned far more often.
[23:57:35] <matsaman> derpadmin: what distro are you using?
[23:57:46] <derpadmin> matsaman: correct, only one monitor detected (can mirror but nothing else)
[23:58:05] <derpadmin> matsaman: debian 11 (tried debian 10, ubuntu, mint, openbsd)
[23:58:26] <DLange> try a recent Fedora derpadmin
[23:58:38] <DLange> much better chances with newer kernels
[23:58:46] <matsaman> TheSilentLink: xhcd? Looks kinda like a typo. You're just curious about the number diffs?
[23:59:01] <derpadmin> DLange: what for? they use different drivers than the one covered by xserver-xorg-video-amdgopu?
[23:59:06] <derpadmin> *amdgpu

[23:59:30] <derpadmin> matsaman: yup, installed mesa
[23:59:35] <matsaman> TheSilentLink: huh, maybe xhcd does nothing and it already worked, though? =P
[23:59:45] <matsaman> derpadmin: right but the specific version could matter, anyway
