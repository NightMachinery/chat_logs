[12:07:49] <Guillaum[m]> Hello. Do you understand the (only) CI failure I do have here: https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server/pull/2655 ?
[12:13:15] <hjulle[m]> It seems like the ghc-9.0.1 build for macos was cancelled for some reason. https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server/runs/5208261329?check_suite_focus=true
[12:13:15] <hjulle[m]> And that seems to be the reason why the test_post_job failed.
[12:15:43] <hjulle[m]> Guillaum: Here's the check for cancelled jobs: https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server/actions/runs/1849794755/workflow#L248
[12:15:43] <hjulle[m]> I don't know why the job was cancelled though.
[12:18:26] <hjulle[m]> I meant ghc-9.0.2 not ghc-9.0.1

[12:32:09] <kokobd[m]> will rebuild HLS locally help?
[12:37:58] <Guest97> I can try that
[13:34:40] <Guest97> it works after a local build indeed, thanks for the suggestion
[13:43:04] <cptwunderlich> Hey folks, so about my problem with HLS/HIE-Bios - still can't get it to work.
[13:43:29] <cptwunderlich> I removed the ".hie-bios/" folder, and ran `HIE_BIOS_OUTPUT=/tmp/hie-test ./hadrian/hie-bios`
[13:44:02] <cptwunderlich> But I get "user error (No prefixes matched "" IN [...wall of text...]\ Build failed"
[13:44:05] <cptwunderlich> https://pastebin.ubuntu.com/p/b38G3jQMNr/

[13:46:00] <cptwunderlich> OH
[13:52:07] <cptwunderlich> @mpickering `HIE_BIOS_OUTPUT=/tmp/hie-test ./hadrian/hie-bios compiler/GHC.hs` runs without error, but when I restart LHS in VS Code I still get

[13:53:13] <mpickering> are  you running vscode in the same environment?

[13:55:00] <cptwunderlich> I guess so? Well, it did work before upgrading to GHC 9.2 and latest HLS
[13:56:13] <mpickering> perhaps there is an issue with hls then
[13:56:21] <mpickering> I would just debug it yourself at this point
[13:58:00] <cptwunderlich> Alright, thank you very much!
[13:58:25] <cptwunderlich> Maybe I'll continue working without it or I try purging and reinstalling when I have time

[17:11:51] <kokobd[m]> It seems that our exactprint won't preserve lines beginning with `#!`. Is this a known issue?
[17:12:41] <kokobd[m]> Use `parseModule` from `Language.Haskell.GHC.ExactPrint` directly preserves this information though
