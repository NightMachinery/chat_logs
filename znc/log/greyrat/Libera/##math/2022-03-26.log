[00:03:47] <ihate> im alright
[00:03:53] <ihate> esuba
[00:04:26] <esuba> I'm working on this problem where I have to prove that the union of a finite and countable set is countable
[00:04:41] <esuba> My approach relies on the intersection being finite, but I can't nail it down
[00:05:07] <greenbagels> What do you mean union of a finite and countable set
[00:05:37] <ihate> Let X be countable and Y finite. Let f:N->X be an enumeration. it is easy to see how to extend this to an enumeration onto X U Y
[00:05:48] <esuba> S U T = { x : x in S |x in T }
[00:06:01] <greenbagels> Ok so the union of two finite sets?
[00:06:08] <esuba> no
[00:06:17] <ihate> countable =/= finite

[00:07:32] <ihate> oops
[00:07:34] <greenbagels> American rather
[00:07:47] <ihate> esuba WLOG assume S and T are disjoint
[00:08:20] <ihate> you don't need a bijection. just a surjection
[00:08:32] <ihate> of N onto SUT
[00:09:16] <isekaijin> esuba: If you have a finite set {x_1, ..., x_n} and a countably infinite set {y_1, y_2, y_3, ...}, what's preventing you from defining z_1 = x_1, ..., z_n = x_n, z_{n+1} = y_1, z_{n+2} = y_2, ... ?
[00:09:51] <isekaijin> Errr, this is assuming that all the x_i and y_j are distinct. But if they are not, just remove the duplicates from the x_i.
[00:09:59] <greenbagels> Well I guess the cat's out of the bag now
[00:10:01] <ihate> i.e., just combine the two enumerations after assuming disjoint
[00:11:16] <isekaijin> Heck, a union of countably many countable sets is still countable, and that can still be done with a silly enumeration trick.
[00:11:25] <ihate> you can also use (uncountable set) - (finite set) is uncountable.
[00:12:17] <ihate> need dat axiom of choice
[00:12:31] <isekaijin> That is more indirect, since uncountability means the non-existence of an exhaustive enumeration.
[00:12:45] <esuba> Well i'm trying to only use what has been explicitly given, in my book so far
[00:12:59] <esuba> while that makes sense , I can't use that yet
[00:13:04] <isekaijin> Well, we don't have access to your book.
[00:13:12] <greenbagels> The strategy given is pretty first principles though
[00:13:22] <greenbagels> All it uses is the definition of countable
[00:13:50] <greenbagels> i.e. bijective with some subset of N
[00:13:52] <Z-module> ihate, sure, it's the Hilbert Hotel argument
[00:14:12] <ihate> hi Z-module
[00:15:32] <esuba> @isekaijin what is preventing me is the intersection
[00:15:40] <ihate> what intersection?
[00:15:52] <ihate> if S and T are not disjoint?
[00:15:56] <isekaijin> esuba: As I said, if some x_i and y_j are duplicate, just remove them from the finite set of the x_i's.
[00:16:08] <isekaijin> esuba: Removing any amount of elements from a finite set still gives you a finite  set.
[00:16:12] <esuba> yes in the general case
[00:16:20] <isekaijin> Anyhow.
[00:16:28] <ihate> let S' = S-T. Then S'UT = SUT.
[00:16:37] <ihate> so WLOG they can be assumed to be disjoint
[00:17:20] <esuba> I play around with that
[00:17:26] <esuba> *I'll
[00:17:40] <isekaijin> Why is the category of CW complexes the “most appropriate category in which to do homotopy theory”?
[00:17:50] <isekaijin> Why not simplicial sets?
[00:18:16] <Franciman> isekaijin: CW complexes are easier to deal with than simplicial sets
[00:18:24] <Franciman> when you want to compose new spaces
[00:18:26] <Franciman> i mean
[00:18:28] <isekaijin> How are CW complexes easier to deal with?
[00:18:45] <isekaijin> Simplicial sets are nice and combinatorial and all.
[00:19:12] <isekaijin> CW complexes are, of course, still “somewhat combinatorial”, but they are also “somewhat squishy” because they are honest topological spaces.
[00:19:31] <Franciman> i found it easier to compose some spaces out of pieces
[00:19:33] <Franciman> with cw complexes
[00:19:41] <Franciman> for example n-dim projective spaces
[00:20:16] <isekaijin> By the way, I didn't mean “simplicial complexes”.
[00:20:27] <isekaijin> A simplicial set is simply a presheaf on \Delta.
[00:20:34] <isekaijin> So a purely combinatorial object.
[00:20:37] <Franciman> ok sorry
[00:20:41] <Franciman> i thought simplicial complexes
[00:20:45] * Franciman apologises
[00:21:03] <isekaijin> Of course CW complexes are easier to glue than simplicial complexes.

[04:04:00] <Guest8738> oh good, i can just use df then
[04:04:27] <Guest8738> thought id seen it before, but unsure. i would get marked down for even slightly wrong notaatiojn today, so..
[04:04:29] <Guest8738> ty
[04:05:17] <ihate> you can always consult your textbook or course notes
[04:05:30] <Galois> ∇f
[04:05:48] <ihate> even if one source says a notation is okay, your prof may disagree and mark you down for not following their conventions
[04:05:59] <Guest8738> i dont think im allowed to use fradient notation for differential equations, maybe im wrong
[04:06:10] <Guest8738> but df or f' should be fine, ty.

[04:06:20] <zacts> that's ridiculous.
[04:06:40] <zacts> what's important I think is the mathematics not the particular notation for the derivative.
[04:07:09] <zacts> if you can communicate the idea to the reader, then yeah.
[04:07:22] <ihate> it's important to follow conventions
[04:07:31] <ihate> otherwise, you'll confuse your reader
[04:08:09] <Galois> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient
[04:08:15] <zacts> to a point I agree. but marking down for the particular notation used for the derivative is ridiculous I think.
[04:08:38] <ihate> I find it more ridiculous to not be able to follow straightforward directions, in my opinion
[04:08:47] <Galois> it's not even clear whether Guest8738 is asking about derivative or gradient
[04:08:57] <Galois> so in some sense you have already failed to communicate the idea
[04:09:28] <ihate> fwiw i wouldn't mark someone down, zacts

[04:09:48] <ihate> i'd would correct them, however.
[04:10:12] <zacts> I think that I might leave a note explaining that I don't understand what they are trying to convey, but I wouldn't mark down points. I'd ask questions.
[04:10:32] <ihate> I'd probably follow that, yeah
[04:12:08] <zacts> I'm off for now.

[04:43:49] <ihate> Jacques you need to show: root(I) = I if I is prime. So, you need to show: if r^m in I for some m, then r is in I.
[04:44:02] <ihate> which follows from primeness
[04:44:42] <Jacques> that is what I did

[04:47:01] <ihate> to simplify: if r^m is in I, then r^(m-1)r is in I. Primeness -> r or r^(m-1) is in I. proceed inductively.
[04:47:37] <ihate> (I don't see how what you wrote gives this)

[05:35:35] <Z-module> It comes down to the fact that for any given point (a_1,...,a_n) in k^n, the evaluation map  k[x_1,...,x_n] -> k   sending p(x_1,...,x_n) to p(a_1,...,a_n)  is a ring homomorphism, so it sends the polynomial   (p(x_1,...,x_n))^n  to the element   (p(a_1,...,a_n))^n  of k. And this element is 0 in k iff p(a_1,...,a_n) itself is.

[10:14:34] <alphamule2> They all had errors, and were about as long as a small novel or opposite end, short and skipping over everything/making too many assumptions.
[10:15:34] <alphamule2> Looking at details:  Connection between integrals, packing problem, and geometry.
[10:15:56] <alphamule2> Leads to a construction of spaces
[10:16:57] <alphamule2> But it just shows things that are obvious, with lower-level explanations.  Useful sometimes but not usually.

[14:03:53] <joel135> my reasoning was that if an element of the lie algebra is a a tangent vector v at e, then one defines a curve gamma(t) by a differential equation associated to v, e.g. gamma(0) = e and gamma'(0) = v. this is what the book tells me, and it then remarks that gamma(t1+t2) = gamma(t1)gamma(t2) so gamma is a homomorphism R -> G, and it says this correspondence v <-> gamma is one-to-one.
[14:06:02] <joel135> i was then thinking that a general function f : R -> G could be "cooled down" by analogy with de rham cohomology while fixing two endpoints f(0) and f(1) to give such a gamma.

[20:23:03] <cadmio> I've a doubt. When you have a field like Z_2[x]/((p(x))  with p(x) irreducible polynomial of Z_2[x]
[20:23:35] <cadmio> you can write the residue classes this way: f(x) + (p(x)) = r(x) + (p(x)) what's the degree of f(x) ?
[20:24:21] *** Joins: Pickchea (~private@user/pickchea)
[20:26:01] <Z-module> there are infinitely possibilities!
[20:26:29] <Z-module> but only one having deg(f) < deg(p)
[20:27:07] <cadmio> yesterday I've taken into account only 2nd degree f(x) = 0, 1, x, x^2, x^2 + 1, x^2 + x + 1 and then removed those that are in the same residue class as x^2 and x+1
[20:27:10] <Z-module> you can replace f(x) with    f(x) + q(x)p(x)   for *any* polynomial q(x) at all, and those cosets all remain the same
[20:27:19] <cadmio> and it worked (but I think by chance)
[20:27:44] <Z-module> I wish you would pick the normal representatives here, which are 0, 1, x, x + 1
[20:27:57] <Z-module> all the possible polys having degree < deg(p), that is
[20:28:19] <Z-module> You don't have to, but you are "expected" to. It's clean and sensible.
[20:28:38] <Z-module> I mean when p(x) is of degree 2, like yesterday
[20:28:42] <cadmio> 0, 1, x, x + 1 are the elements I had to find
[20:29:15] <cadmio> my strategy was to use the division algorithm (dividing by p(x)) and take the remainder
[20:29:43] <Z-module> If p(x) is x^2 + x + 1, then the two cosets   x + (p(x)),   x^2 + 1 + (p(x))   are identical, but for clean notation we prefer the one using the smaller-degree representative
[20:29:55] <Z-module> yes, we use the remainders
[20:30:36] <cadmio> yes but you're dividing a f(x) in Z_2[x] by p(x) and there are infinite choices for f(x) that could be of any degree
[20:31:20] *** Quits: blueberrycrop (~blueberry@209.222.169.22) (Quit: Client closed)
[20:33:21] <Z-module> no, I'm saying there exist infinitely many possible f(x) that ALL have the exact same remainder upon division by p(x)
[20:34:39] <Z-module> Just as all the cosets  ..., -2 + (3),  1 + (3),  4 + (3), 7 + (3), ...   of the ideal (3) in Z are the same coset. The "canonical" choice is the one where the representive is in  {0, 1, ..., 3-1}, namely 1 + (3) here
[20:35:58] <Z-module> in your case, the possible choices of f(x) aren't of *any* degree, but the degrees all differ by some multiple of 2  (2 is deg(p))
[20:36:04] <cadmio> I don't understand what's the strategy for finding the elements of Z_2[x]/((p(x))
[20:36:31] <Z-module> It's simply every possible   r(x) + (p(x))  where deg(r(x)) < deg(p(x)).
[20:36:39] <Z-module> just use ALL such low-degree r(x)
[20:36:49] <Z-module> since the scalar field is finite, there are just finitely many of these
[20:37:21] <Z-module> namely, the possible such r(x) are:   0x + 0,  0x + 1,  1x + 0,  1x + 1    which we more commonly write as  0, 1, x, x+1
[20:38:39] <Z-module> I mean, you can write a coset like  x + (p(x))  in infinitely many other ways  f(x) + (r(x)),  but only this way has the f with degree < deg(p)
[20:38:50] <Z-module> the "remainder after division by p(x)"

[20:41:09] <Z-module> oh sorry, I was wrong before: these f(x), for the coset x + (p(x)),  can have any degree deg(x) or  deg(x) + deg(p(x))   or any integer > that last.
[20:41:27] <Z-module> you just add any of  p(x), x p(x),  x^2 p(x), ....   to the original x
[20:41:37] <Z-module> those all yield the same coset
[20:41:44] <cadmio> ok so that's descends from the division algorithm since  f(x) = q(x)p(x) + r(x) with deg(r(x)) < deg(p(x)) you can pick only 0 + (p(x)), 1 + (p(x)), x + (p(x)), 1 + x + (p(x))
[20:41:54] <cadmio> *that
[20:42:31] <Z-module> yes if you want the r(x) with that degree < deg(p)
[20:42:45] <Z-module> those are ALL the polys in Z_2[x] of degree < 2
[20:42:50] <Z-module> that's what you get every time, in general

[21:11:02] <Z-module> so to write out tthe above fully, with no use of mod:  In  Z_2[x]/(p(x)) :   (x + 1 + (p(x))) (x + (p(x))) = 1 + (p(x))
[21:11:06] <cadmio> so when doing the multiplication we're multiplying things with the +(p(x)) appended
[21:11:18] <cadmio> exaclty like that!
[21:11:26] <Z-module> right
[21:11:49] <Z-module> but you should be warned that beyond the first algebra course, most people don't bother keeping on with all the  + (ideal)    part

[21:12:15] <Z-module> or sometimes they put overlines above the elements, instead
[21:12:37] <cadmio> like in Z_n/nZ
[21:12:47] <Z-module> Z/nZ  you mean, but yes
[21:12:56] <cadmio> yes
[21:13:30] <dude12312414> imagine writing elements of Z_2[x]/(p(x)) as (q(x) + (2)) + (p(x))
[21:14:43] <Z-module> by the way, even without calculating at all, you can reason that the inverse in Z_2[x]/(p(x)) of (the coset of)  x + 1  had to be  x.  Because it can't be 1, can't be 0, and the set of nonzero things in this four-element field has three elements, so no element is its own inverse.  x is the only possibility left.

[21:24:07] <harwiltz> Hello all. I'm working on a problem pertaining to the stable marriage problem: there are n men and n women, each of the men has a strict preference list over the women and vice versa for the women. A stable matching is a set of n (boy,girl) pairs such that there is no pair (b, g) in the set where both b and g would prefer to be together than with their respective partners. I'm trying to find the
[21:24:09] <harwiltz> smallest n for which there can be a stable matching where no one is matched with their first choice. I conjecture that n = 3 is too small, but I can't prove it. I'm thinking about using group theory to eliminate symmetric instances of the preference lists, but my group theory knowledge is self-taught from many years ago. Anyone have any pointers?

[21:42:00] <harwiltz> I thought there might be a simpler way
[21:42:55] <magic_ninja> Z-module, so if I'm understanding this right, taking the gradient of some scalar function will give me a directional derivative pointing in the direction of greatest increase. Dotting it with a vector will yield a scalar function, and crossing it with a vector will give me a vector, but the del operator itself is a vector.

[21:44:15] <Z-module> magic_ninja: the context should make it clear. The *other* main use of Del, and this not with no arrow and no vector context, is for the Laplacian of a twice-differentiable function of two variables:     Del f(x,y) = f_xx + f_yy        Except, sadly, this is also denoted  Del^2   often. There's a lot of competing tradition.
[21:44:29] <Z-module> this *has no arrow...

[21:58:59] <rond_> basically what I mean is  $\forall (u,v) \in E(G) \setminus E(T') \colon (u, lca(u,v)) \in Q$ and Q is minimal
[21:59:11] <Z-module> the way I just wrote is that
[21:59:24] <Z-module> the set of all those ordered triples
[21:59:32] <rond_> oh, no
[21:59:34] <rond_> these are pairs
[21:59:43] <Z-module> you wrote an ordered triple
[21:59:52] <Z-module>   ( - , - , - )
[22:00:07] <rond_> oh, my bad, sorry :(
[22:00:08] <Z-module> where the third element itself is an ordered pair

[22:01:35] <Z-module> Then just    { (v, lca(u,v)) : all (u,v) in E(G) \ E(T') }
[22:02:21] <rond_> (u,v) in E(G) \ E(T')     <- here (u,v) is unordered. Should it be {u,v} then?
[22:02:28] <Z-module> oh yes!
[22:02:32] <rond_> and (v, lca(u,v,)) is ordered
[22:02:34] <Z-module>  ( ... )  is always ordered
[22:03:39] <rond_>  { (v, lca(u,v)) : all {u,v} in E(G) \ E(T') }   it means that for each edge `(u,v)`  two pairs will be inserted to Q, right?

[22:05:28] <Z-module> In the set-builder notation   { ... : ... }   the stuff to the left is literally what the elements are in this set (in your case, just certain ordered pairs), and the stuff the the right is the conditions that have to be met to qualify to be in this set. It's not an operational/procedural thing.
[22:05:39] <Z-module> It's a static set.

[23:14:07] <magic_ninja> buster, thanks for the info. I'm guessing these would be spacial vectors as we aren't working in dynamics yet. Would the arrow be for spacial rather than spacetime?
