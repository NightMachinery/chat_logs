[09:23:17] <serafeim> Mayel[m]: thank you I'll check it out
[09:25:03] <Mayel[m]> You'll need to either serve it on another port or do some workarounds with routes

[09:38:03] <Mayel[m]> Well you can do that if you access it on another port
[09:38:36] <Mayel[m]> And still setup Livebook to be embedded in your app so you can run migrations or any other function from your app

[21:20:40] <josevalim> I think you can run it anyway?
[21:20:46] <josevalim> or is the run button hidden?
[21:21:08] <josevalim> fub: what is your OS?

[21:24:08] <josevalim> fub: can you run `epmd -names` in your terminal?
[21:24:27] <LostKobrakai_> I just see the url input and the error message
[21:24:50] <LostKobrakai_> I just saw the website is open source, so will take a look and see if I can do a PR
[21:25:29] <fub> yeah I found this issue some time ago and tried the stuff there. when the livebook server is started, it shows: name livebook_lsqej6f3 at port 59117
[21:25:32] <josevalim> LostKobrakai_: yeah, in any case, open up an issue
[21:25:53] <LostKobrakai_> btw neat idea to use localStorage for it :D
[21:26:08] <fub> when I stop the livebook server, the instance is gone (livebook_lsqe.. in this example)
[21:27:24] <josevalim> fub: how are you running it?
[21:27:27] <josevalim> escript or mix?
[21:27:35] <fub> just "livebook server"
[21:27:56] <josevalim> try this:

[21:29:49] <josevalim> i thought we detected this case, but apparently we don't
[21:30:01] <josevalim> can you try this:
[21:30:06] <josevalim> `iex --sname foo`

[21:35:31] <fub> ".fritz.box" is my local network domain
[21:36:24] <josevalim> this is the issue
[21:36:30] <josevalim> your computer name is not resolving to localhost
[21:36:34] <josevalim> do you know why?
[21:37:18] <fub> mh, no
[21:37:43] <srfsh> do you have an entry in /etc/hosts for localhost?
[21:37:59] <josevalim> or rather, an entry in /etc/hosts for rbox-m1?
[21:38:03] <fub> yeah Im checking it
[21:38:09] <fub> its missing for 127.0.0.1
[21:38:16] <srfsh> josevalim: I thuoght you said «localhost»?
[21:38:20] <fub> thats strange, I did not touch it
[21:38:57] <srfsh> oh, nvm.
[21:39:10] <fub> this fixed it (adding "rbox-m1" to the "127.0.0.1 localhost" entry in /etc/hosts
[21:39:35] <josevalim> macs are supposed to do that for you (but apparently not always?)
[21:39:52] <fub> very strange, I'm sure I did not remove anything there
[21:40:10] <fub> but maybe macOS did something strange there when I recovered from a backup (different machine)
[21:40:16] <fub> and did not put the new machine name in there
[21:40:19] <fub> thanks a lot for your help!

[22:00:16] <rawtaz> unlikely, considering you have dependencies like the database and thereby storage and possibly networking etc to consider as well. unless of course you just store the data you CRUD in memory.
