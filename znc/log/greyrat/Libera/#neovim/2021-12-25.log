[00:22:14] <maverun[m]> seriously tho,what the hell it is
[00:22:18] <maverun[m]> i been wondering about it but i give up
[00:22:23] <maverun[m]> dundargoc:  we need doc master
[00:22:48] <sunjonSenghanBri> there's indicators showing the scope of open/unfolded folds
[00:22:50] <sunjonSenghanBri> they appear there.
[00:23:04] <sunjonSenghanBri> or a `+` if it's closed/folded
[00:23:21] <sunjonSenghanBri> it's additional to the inline fold formatting
[00:23:40] <dundargoc> 'foldcolumn' is a number, which sets the width for a column on the side of the

[00:24:08] <dundargoc> It's the width of the foldcolumn
[00:25:28] <sunjonSenghanBri> i'd say that's a less good answer :]
[00:26:31] <bfredl> `'foldcolumn'` is not `foldcolumn` but as there is no explicit tag for the latter `:help` jumps to the former :)
[00:26:51] <sunjonSenghanBri> 'what is signcolumn?' 'it's the width of signcolumn'

[00:34:51] <maverun[m]> oh god, combine foldcolumn 9 and signcolumn 9 make it even bigger...
[00:35:42] <maverun[m]> well i feel like that is obviously answer... anyway aint they kinda similar? you could put foldcolumn into signcolumn since its sign like `+`?

[00:40:32] <maverun[m]> ? i a msorry but what is context to this? i mean i get idea of foldcolumn is, or are you talking about that pipe line when unfold?
[00:40:35] <sunjonSenghanBri> it's only 'just a +' when it's folded. The next foldable object above it has vert lines showing what would be folded
[00:40:49] <maverun[m]> which is why it is not part of sign column?
[00:41:09] <sunjonSenghanBri> the `+` signs are even mouse clickable
[00:41:24] <sunjonSenghanBri> because it would overwrite all the signs
[00:41:54] <maverun[m]> ahh i never knew about mouse clickable...
[00:41:55] <maverun[m]> that make sense
[00:41:57] <maverun[m]> thanks for clarify
[00:41:57] <sunjonSenghanBri> if I have a function/ojbect that was more lines that the window height, it'd show entirely the pipe

[08:08:28] <R2COM> how can i navigate back and forth through functions/classes etc in nvim? for example in VsCode if you ctrl+click over function you go there, then more and more.. then i press "back" on my mose as in browser to traverse back same route. can i do similar in nvim and if yes what is easiest way?
[08:09:03] <mjlbach[m]> Well, first you need a language server client
[08:09:06] <mjlbach[m]> (probably)
[08:09:26] <mjlbach[m]> then `gd` (if you map it) and `c-o`/`c-i` are your friend
[08:10:19] <R2COM> i do have nvim setup with autocomplete and all in my freebsd build already
[08:10:32] <R2COM> so how do i say "enter" the function at which cursor is? c-i ?
[08:10:40] <R2COM> and then c-o to go back out of that function?
[08:13:27] <mjlbach[m]> No
[08:13:36] <mjlbach[m]> autocomplete isn't a language server client
[08:13:52] <mjlbach[m]> which plugin are you using for that? CoC? Built-in?
[08:14:15] <R2COM> i do have lsp installed
[08:14:17] <R2COM> forgot which
[08:14:39] <mjlbach[m]> ok, well I can't help you until you figure that out :)
[08:14:58] <R2COM> are you saying if i have that installed then im already good to go?
[08:15:03] <R2COM> or anything else i need on top?
[08:15:19] <mjlbach[m]> well, you need to figure out what the definition request is mapped to, or map it
[08:15:22] <mjlbach[m]> for me, it's gd
[08:15:25] <mjlbach[m]>  * for me, it's `gd`
[08:15:39] <R2COM> gd does what for you?
[08:16:49] <mjlbach[m]> goes to the definition of the symbol under my cursor
[08:17:19] <mjlbach[m]> >  for example in VsCode if you ctrl+click over function you go there, then more and more
[08:17:19] <mjlbach[m]> that would be the equivalent if I'm understanding your request

[19:16:39] <mort> are there better C indenters out there?

[19:19:51] <luisiacc[m]> <n00bvim0[m]> "luisiacc: BTW why not <C-T>?" <- What's that ? I have mapped ctrl T to another thing for like a year
[19:20:00] <asvln> ok, it is nvim-lspconfig which is adding them, I want the functionality it provides, such as diagnostics results in the sidebar but not the inlays.
[19:20:27] <asvln> no setting I have tried changing removes the inlays. I've been trying for like a week.
[19:20:32] <luisiacc[m]> <numToStr[m]> "lspconfig doesn't show inlay..." <- what? I only have rust analyzer on lspconfig and it does show inline hints
[19:20:36] <amosbird> https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/3344 hmm, so this is still not implemented yet
[19:21:07] <numToStr[m]> mjlbach himself said it doesn't
[19:21:26] <numToStr[m]> soo, I am on team mj
[19:21:49] <n00bvim0[m]> luisiacc: Vim has separate lists: jump list and tag stack. <C-T> is for tag stack.
[19:22:08] <mjlbach[m]> luisiacc[m]: I promise you there are no inlay hints for rust analyzer
[19:22:13] <mjlbach[m]> in core*
[19:22:26] <mjlbach[m]> there is virtual text for diagnostics and codelens, which look similar
[19:22:48] <luisiacc[m]> ohh I might be mistaken it with codelens
[19:22:50] <numToStr[m]> (guys better to audit your plugins ;))
[19:22:55] <asvln> I am using the basic config from the readme, and they are definitely there. I stripped it down as much as possible.
[19:23:25] <mjlbach[m]> well, it's not inlay hints
[19:23:40] <mjlbach[m]> idk how to convince you about that apart from saying I implemented a ton of the code myself...
[19:23:59] <numToStr[m]> asvln: care to show us? you might be mistaken for something else
[19:24:20] <luisiacc[m]> yeah it's codelens, sry
[19:24:31] <asvln> do you know how I can disable codelens stuff then? its appearing inline so I only assumed it was inlay.
[19:25:06] <asvln> I can also look it up, I just didnt even know that was a thing
[19:25:23] <luisiacc[m]> n00bvim0[m]: Oh didn't know that, thanks.
[19:25:29] <mjlbach[m]> codelens isn't enabled by default
[19:25:39] <mjlbach[m]> it's probably virtual text like I said from the diagnostic provider
[19:25:50] <mjlbach[m]> vim.diagnostic.config { virtual_text = false }
[19:26:24] <luisiacc[m]> so apparently I have a wrong concept of inlay hint
[19:26:54] <mjlbach[m]> inlay hints are for type annotations, typically they are by the variable they describe
[19:26:59] <mjlbach[m]> we can't do that in neovim yet
[19:27:28] <mjlbach[m]> there's a PR for anticonceal (equivalent functionality for the decorations provider), we would also have to add support for the inlay hint notification to set anticonceal at the appropriate range
[19:27:28] <luisiacc[m]> yes I say a PR from bfredl that I think it attempts to do that
[19:27:58] <mjlbach[m]> inlay hints aren't on spec so I won't add them until it's accepted into LSP 3.17 (or whenever)
[19:29:41] <numToStr[m]> ohh, it's in the new spec. I thought that the rust-analyzer is the only madlad in town.
[19:30:11] <mjlbach[m]> It is?

[20:18:50] <asvln> mjlbach[m] that does clarify things, for as confusing as lua integration is for me.
[20:19:29] <mjlbach[m]> hmm what does this have to do with lua integration?
[20:19:42] <asvln> i mean lua becoming a part of vim in general
[20:20:04] <asvln> i find lua very hard to read and will never use it beyong setting up nvim.
[20:20:42] <asvln> i've got too many syntaxes rolling around in my head
[20:20:52] <numToStr[m]> asvln:  s/lua/vim
[20:21:22] <mjlbach[m]> I cannot understand that tbh
[20:21:29] <mjlbach[m]> lua is like the syntactically simplest language out there
[20:22:09] <Bowuigi[m]> asvln: Do you usually read whitespace or something?
[20:22:13] <Bowuigi[m]> mjlbach[m]: Yeah lol
[20:22:33] <asvln> i prefer SASS to SCSS, so yeah I guess
[20:23:03] <n00bvim0[m]> mjlbach: But LISP...
[20:23:09] <asvln> but parsing out {({})} is very hard for me.
[20:23:18] <asvln> probably some form of minor dyslexia
[20:24:20] <Bowuigi[m]> The syntactically simplest language is probably a stack based esolang that uses single char based parsing
[20:24:29] <Bowuigi[m]> But that would be hard to reaf
[20:24:41] <Bowuigi[m]> s/reaf/read/
[20:25:08] <mjlbach[m]> There are valid complaints about lua
[20:25:27] <mjlbach[m]> like the lack of a strong type system, abundance of nil, lack of enforcing fixed arg numbers, etc.
[20:25:42] <n00bvim0[m]> Stop please
[20:26:35] <Bowuigi[m]> mjlbach[m]: Lol
[20:27:04] <Bowuigi[m]> Most can be surpassed using the builtin stuff

[20:31:37] <Bowuigi[m]> n00bvim0[m]: What
[20:31:54] <n00bvim0[m]> The Lua case implementation may easily launch nuclear missiles due to a typo.
[20:32:02] <mjlbach[m]> The nice part about lua, is there is an amazing language server
[20:32:51] <bfredl> `try parse_lua() except failure: launch_missiles() end`
[20:32:52] <Bowuigi[m]> mjlbach[m]: True, provided that you disable the "lowercase global variable" warning
[20:33:18] <Bowuigi[m]> bfredl: Lua has no try/catch
[20:33:48] <luisiacc[m]> oh boy
[20:33:52] <bfredl> Bowuigi[m]: That's a good warning, though you need to specify a whitelist of allowed globals like `vim` :]
[20:34:05] <bfredl> Bowuigi[m]: lol what is pcall()
[20:34:08] <Bowuigi[m]> `if not (pcall(parse_lua)) then launch_missiles() end`
[20:34:34] <Bowuigi[m]> bfredl: That is not exactly try/catch but it works
[20:34:59] <bfredl> Bowuigi[m]: yes, if it works it works. otherwise, missiles.

[21:02:00] <mjlbach[m]> well
[21:02:03] <mjlbach[m]> you can ask

[21:02:08] <mjlbach[m]> I promise you they work
[21:02:14] <asvln> I'm sure they do

[21:03:15] <asvln> is is running and attached to the buffer
[21:03:33] <mjlbach[m]> Ok, have you called setup {} more than once on rust analyzer somewhere in your config?

[21:04:23] <asvln> you are magic and i love you
[21:04:38] <asvln> i had a second call for setup

[21:04:49] <mjlbach[m]> I've been meaning to make that an error
[21:05:11] <mjlbach[m]> FYI you don't have to map keybinds in on_attach
[21:05:18] <mjlbach[m]> it's just good practice, since they override some defaults
[21:05:46] <mjlbach[m]> Someday if we add submodes to neovim we could have an LSP submode that maps some defaults
[21:07:50] <asvln> i am just trying to follow the readme because i didnt even know how to make normal keybinds in lua, cause the syntax looks different everytime I look at different documentation.
[21:08:03] <asvln> I could just learn lua properly, and prob should have
[21:08:12] <asvln> would have prevented all of this probably
[21:09:54] <mjlbach[m]> It's not really lua, it's the neovim API

[21:12:36] <asvln> yeah, that makes sense and makes me feel a bit better
[21:12:42] <mjlbach[m]> it's valid but it won't do what you think it does
[21:13:08] <luisiacc[m]> mjlbach[m]: what's the right way?
[21:13:08] <mjlbach[m]> you should override root_dir in setup, I've been procrasting on project support for months
[21:13:19] <mjlbach[m]> well just do a normal `setup {}` call and pass root_dir in
[21:13:31] <luisiacc[m]> but if I call setup(), wouldn't that overwrite the default config I have?
[21:13:51] <mjlbach[m]> Yes, it would
[21:14:01] <luisiacc[m]> what if I don't want to do that
[21:14:07] <luisiacc[m]> I just want to update the root_dir
[21:14:49] <mjlbach[m]> I would need to check the scope of all of the state variables associated with what is called by the try_add function

[22:39:49] <kylo252[m]> what's the plan here btw: 
[22:39:49] <kylo252[m]> > upstream project management/lspinfo (checkhealth?)/lspconfig utilities around path and root detection to core (maybe with plenary.path?). Ideally this would reduce boiler plate shared between nvim-jdtls, nvim-metals, etc.
[22:39:49] <kylo252[m]> we could really use some kind of pathlib, but I'm not sure the one from plenary is quite ready, and it looks generally challenging anyway to get it right cross-platform
[22:40:42] <mjlbach[m]> well
[22:40:50] <mjlbach[m]> I am working on the path library literally as we speak
[22:41:21] <mjlbach[m]> I think the one from plenary is too much, and I think all paths should be internally normalized before any operations take place, so I'm just writing a new one
[22:41:27] <kylo252[m]> plenary's? or a hybrid with the one from lspconfig?
[22:41:44] <mjlbach[m]> it's just from scratch
[22:42:36] <kylo252[m]> what's a bit disappointing for me in plenary's implementation is the under-utilization of libuv
