[09:24:20] <danpg> is there some audio background I don't know, like mapping to ints from a sample count doesn't click for me
[09:24:57] <Decker> you've seen wave forms right?  wiggly things that go from left to right?  Each point along that line is a value in the array

[09:25:32] <danpg> mmm gotcha so, you request # samples, and it would feed you the wave form data? # samples over what period of time?
[09:25:56] <danpg> I see they have rate defined, so do you need to match the rate?
[09:26:06] <danpg> 44100 samples per second?
[09:26:16] <Decker> the sample rate is number of samples per time - but you ask for it in sample count not time - you'll have to reverse calculate samples / (samples/time) = time
[09:26:26] *** Joins: merijn (~merijn@c-001-001-001.client.esciencecenter.eduvpn.nl)
[09:26:37] <Decker> samples / (44100) = time  (seconds)
[09:28:08] <danpg> gotcha that all makes sense, last bit I don't follow is the interface, discussing specifically audio reading from the server, you read into a buffer of some size, how often do you need to read? Or will it just buffer it for you and you are expected to consume and play
[09:28:35] <danpg> For example buffer can be N samples long, and you consume some number, but whatever you are doing you need to play at sample rate (44100) in this case
[09:28:39] <TheLinuxNerd> danpg, so a sample is simply a measured frequency at a certain moment. The bigger the sample rate, the more measurements within each second.
[09:28:46] <Decker> you will re-sample as soon as you get a buffer completed back... you want to always be sampling
[09:28:48] <danpg> I assume different processes can have their own buffer?
[09:29:01] <Decker> it depends on how big your buffer is how long between swapping you need

[09:30:31] *** Joins: flakland (~flaknet99@32.211.211.39)
[09:30:33] <Decker> you can probably queue multiple reads... usually sound drivers expect when a buffer completes that there will be a way to get a new buffer immediately ; but sound IS pretty slow so it has a relatively long time to actually get around to a new buffer
[09:31:48] <danpg> what do you mean by a buffer completing?
[09:32:02] <Decker> being filled with samples
[09:32:25] <Decker> having been completey filled with samples
[09:32:31] <TheLinuxNerd> danpg, so your soundsystem has a buffer, and every program has a buffer 
[09:32:55] <TheLinuxNerd> and the hardware has a buffer .... after all you're streaming 
[09:33:03] <danpg> what would be an example of a buffer being completely filled with samples? Is a buffer generally a certain size?
[09:33:16] <Decker> ya
[09:33:20] <Decker> a size you pick
[09:33:24] <TheLinuxNerd> danpg, yes, my DAC for instance has 2048 samples buffer by default
[09:33:35] <TheLinuxNerd> but it can go up to 16384 samples
[09:33:39] <danpg> if buffer is full and there is more audio to be placed on it is it dropped or like a ring buffer?
[09:33:56] <Decker> I'd pick like 1/10 sample rate... so 4410  samples 8810 bytes for 16 bit samples
[09:34:01] <danpg> buffer is just mainly there to give time for programs to react and read data over the buffer?
[09:34:09] <Decker> you feed it a new buffer

[09:34:19] <Decker> sound is usually at least double-buffered
[09:34:24] <Decker> sound sampling
[09:34:31] <TheLinuxNerd> danpg, so buffer is a queue, it will only buffer if it has space
[09:34:51] <Decker> it's not a queue  the head is always at the same point
[09:34:56] <Decker> it's not a ring buffer
[09:35:00] <danpg> this buffer is mainained on the pulse audio server?
[09:35:01] <TheLinuxNerd> danpg, 1 | 2 3 4 | 5 then 2 | 3 4 5 | 6
[09:35:06] *** Joins: rindolf (~shlomif@inkscape/dev/shlomif)
[09:35:26] <TheLinuxNerd> danpg,  there are multiple buffers
[09:35:31] <Decker> no it's allocated by you, and given the library to fill from the server by your program
[09:36:29] <danpg> Oh sure, so you give the server the buffer and it writes in data and then you consume the data based on the sample rate
[09:36:47] <danpg> I assume pulse audio maintains some internal buffer ? Or perhaps folks lean on the callback model more
[09:37:01] <Decker> you still need your own buffers to get the data out
[09:37:04] <danpg> er, probably a bit word soupy there
[09:37:07] <danpg> @ my own message
[09:37:28] <danpg> Yeah makes sense, so PA probably has some stream of the playback and then you provide buffers to load it out
[09:37:29] <Decker> regardless of what the server /client side library ends up having
[09:37:39] <TheLinuxNerd> danpg, so, you have a physical hardware buffer inside the DAC on your motherboard, you have a software buffer in pulseaudio and another buffer in the program playing music, let's say VLC
[09:37:43] <danpg> and you specify some amount you are willing to load up on the buffer
[09:38:10] <danpg> If you used sample rate of say 10samples / second, and provided a buffer that could accomodate 100 samples, would it not finish for 10s?
[09:38:23] <Decker> yup
[09:38:42] <Decker> it's not like you can get 10 seconds of realtime audio before 10 seconds passes
[09:38:54] <Decker> (2 seconds later, has 10 seconds into the future? :)   
[09:39:06] <danpg> lol true, just confirming the structure with a simple example so I don't word soup it up
[09:40:05] *** Quits: spac3 (~space@142.126.128.74) (Remote host closed the connection)
[09:40:17] <Decker> hmm.. if you were travelling at 10x the speed of sound into a sound source...
[09:40:25] <danpg> gotcha so you keep your in program buffer small so not to block too much ? Like if you want to read the audio within 10ms of latency 1000ms = s, so you need like a buffer that will get filled (1000ms/10ms) = 100 times per second?
[09:40:51] <Decker> 100ms or 10/sec for reading works
[09:41:06] <danpg> so for a 44100 channel, I would pick a buffer of 441
[09:41:10] <Decker> depends on how much latency you can tolerate and what you're doing if it's realtime effects where you're immediatly playing it 1ms 
[09:41:14] <Decker> is already too long realy
[09:41:15] <danpg> size in order to get 100 full buffers per second?
[09:41:36] <danpg> if you wanted 1ms do you just go for really small buffers?
[09:41:40] <Decker> ya
[09:41:44] <Decker> 44.1
[09:41:54] *** Quits: \o` (~\o`@user/o/x-1005988) (Quit: Client closed)
[09:42:08] <danpg> 0.1 of a long O_O
[09:42:14] <Decker> short
[09:42:22] <Decker> 16 bits
[09:42:25] <danpg> shoot, yeah
[09:42:29] <danpg> but 0.1 of a short
[09:42:30] <Decker> 45
[09:42:30] <danpg> O_O
[09:42:40] <Decker> and count samples and convert total samples to time
[09:42:48] <Decker> forget time as a driving factor :)
[09:43:36] <danpg> so 44.1 * 16 bit can be turned into approx 1ms of sound
[09:43:52] <Decker> yes
[09:43:54] <danpg> I don't get the wave form representation but I think that's probably something I can try googling a bit around for 
[09:44:03] <danpg> thanks this makes a lot of sense
[09:44:05] <Decker> 0 is the middle + is above, - is below
[09:44:29] <Decker> it's up to a max range of +32767 and -32768
[09:44:48] <Decker> so you scale that to +/-1 and draw it on a graph
[09:45:16] <danpg> this reveals how I don't know sound, is sound over a period of time just represented by fluctuating graph? and that is something such that you can compose a single waveform to combine multiple?
[09:45:27] <Decker> yes

[12:13:20] <epony> piou, yes.. C has become an interface to other languages due to its efficiency as a system programming language also used in compilers and related
[12:13:31] <amigojapan> Nice
[12:13:42] <epony> it's not just a language, correct observation

[12:14:36] <amigojapan> epony: good compilers can compile themselves
[12:14:51] <piou> nobody's questionning its impact as a system programming language
[12:14:56] <epony> amigojapan, yes, but they pass through C before they become self-hosted
[12:15:25] <epony> so it's not about good compilers, but a point about language implementations

[12:39:58] <epony> it's likely 'thee article' is missing it
[12:40:05] <smallville7123> piou: i think C was originally (and parially is) implemented via assembly
[12:40:08] <piou> "likely"
[12:40:26] <piou> smallville7123: not the point, never was
[12:40:39] <flakland> you don't need to use C to interact with the OS
[12:40:42] <smallville7123> until the C compiler gained the abiility to compile itself via its own language
[12:40:46] <flakland> but the OS  MIGHT be implemented in C
[12:41:11] <piou> I realize that it's the internet and people keep expressing opinions on things they haven't read, but frankly this is getting ridiculous
[12:41:32] <flakland> its ridiculous to imply otherwise as fact
[12:41:51] <epony> the github is 'teh interdump' for "blah"s
[12:42:04] <piou> There is 0 value in criticizing a point when you don't know what the point is
[12:42:32] <piou> it just goes to show how deep the dogma surrounding these old languages go
[12:42:36] <smallville7123> it IS possible to implement a language entirely in raw Assembly but that is highly cpu/archetecture specific
[12:42:45] <epony> it's not dogma, it's standards and implementations
[12:42:56] <piou> I'm not talking about standards and implementations
[12:43:14] <piou> I'm talking about coming to the defense of the language when we don't even know whether it's attacked or not
[12:43:23] <piou> That's where the true dogma is
[12:43:31] <flakland> i think most people get caught up in libc being ubiquitous, and using that as some kind of portable API
[12:43:39] <smallville7123> or rather, transpile a language from invented language directly to assembly
[12:43:41] <piou> People got to stop expecting to be offended by everything
[12:43:46] <flakland> maybe thats where the misconceptions stem from

[12:44:25] <mobidrop> we just see it as it is and that shouldn't be offending
[12:44:27] <smallville7123> but most just transpile from invented language to c cus its way easier than learning assembly unless you need to specifically optimize the assembly
[12:44:37] <smallville7123> (which you can do in C as well)

[12:45:41] <piou> epony: so my question is: why do you do that?
[12:45:50] <smallville7123> also C is VERY portable so transpiling to valid C will compile on any platform that C supports

[12:46:39] <smallville7123> eg you dont need to write a transpiler for x86 and x64 and armv7 and aarch64 cus you only need to transpile to C and then cross compile for each arch
[12:46:42] <epony> the smartest way to bring opinions and request for comments, is not what you did ;-)

[12:59:28] <piou> you can put that on the implementation side, but if the standard allows that implementation difference then that's something the standard can fix
[13:00:20] <amigojapan> piou: I rather write most userland programs in a memory safe language

[15:34:40] <DnzAtWrk> that is true, but it's not just the memories themselves. As we know, memories also change the way we think
[15:34:50] <DnzAtWrk> it's not just data, but... filters I guess
[15:35:26] <mobidrop> yes it's not statically stored like in a book, memory is associative so it has to be in the network somehow

[20:44:54] <roxlu> Hi, does someone knows how to do this (using C): i've got a static library `core.lib` that contains logging functions. The log functions use a single instance of `static struct log_context* g_log = NULL` . On Windows, when I have run-time loadable DLLs that link with `core.lib`, each DLL will create it's own `g_log` instance; but instead I want them to share the same instance. Is this
[20:44:56] <roxlu> possible on Windows? (On linux this is pretty straight foward). 
[20:45:13] <pyzozord> I think you'll still end up with something that looks like a vm even without eval
[20:45:26] <GeDaMo> OK, you need to include the compiler in the generated program :P

[20:45:38] <bnchs> and provide the libraries with the pointer to your log context

[20:53:49] <eson123> guys what is the usual idea for streaming video live through a webcam to a webpage ? i guess it will create a websocket to connect back to the server and the server will captures each frame, split it up  ( maybe ? since it's UDP ) and sends it over ?
