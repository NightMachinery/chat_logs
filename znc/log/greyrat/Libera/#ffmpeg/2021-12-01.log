[00:15:43] <yuri6037> strange thing is avio_w8 attempts to read address 0x18 like if avformat_alloc_output_context2 forgot to initialize a field of its struct
[00:16:49] <BtbN> It's much more likely you provided some invalid input somewhere.
[00:17:06] <BtbN> If avio and avformat was fundamentally broken like that, we'd have noticed a long time ago.
[00:17:48] <yuri6037> is avformat_alloc_output_context2 able to deal with just one video stream in H264 and no audio stream when filename is set to a file ending in .mkv?
[00:18:50] <BtbN> Not sure what exactly you're asking, but mkv supports the total lack of audio streams just fine.
[00:20:14] <yuri6037> I'm thinking there might be something in the file that it doesn't like
[00:20:39] <yuri6037> so I was asking maybe avformat cannot deal with no audio stream and segfault in that case
[00:21:02] <BtbN> That's very unlikely. And even if, if that caused random segfaults, it'd be a serious bug.
[00:21:17] <BtbN> Still a 99.9% chance you're just using the API wrong.

[00:37:55] <yuri6037> and even still if it absolutely needed to not open the file I give it it's still unexpected to have it segfault later instead of returning an error code
[00:38:33] <furq> if it's segfaulting either you are doing something wrong or you've found a bug that you should report
[00:38:51] <furq> if you think it's the latter then you should be very sure about it
[00:39:27] <BtbN> Looking at the avformat_write_header, it _does_ check for a valid AVFormatContext->pb
[00:39:55] <BtbN> So you're somehow setting it to an invalid value, which it then crashes on when trying to use it.
[00:40:01] <yuri6037> interestingly on my computer it just segfaults when avio_open has not been called
[00:40:48] <yuri6037> I've just added an avio_open right after creating the AVFormatContext and it no longer segfaults
[00:41:07] <BtbN> Which is exactly what the docs say how you should do it, yes.
[00:41:07] <yuri6037> maybe is it an ubuntu bug
[00:41:17] <BtbN> How would it possibly be related to Ubuntu?
[00:41:37] <yuri6037> because i'm using an ubuntu package for libavformat and libavcodec
[00:41:41] <BtbN> Are you allocating AVFormatContext on the stack, and aren't properly zero-initializing it somehow?
[00:42:02] <yuri6037> I'm not allocating it on the stack it's a pointer
[00:43:34] <yuri6037> like I have a wrapper struct in C code which I allocate myself which contains a pointer to AVFormatContext as well as to all needed encoders and RGB buffer
[00:44:12] <BtbN> Somehow that boguous value of 0x18 got in there. Which is enough to make the !pb checks pass, but is still clearly invalid

[02:10:01] <BtbN> yuri6037, you're again not reading the documentation properly. And also not understanding what the functions is actually doing...
[02:10:45] <BtbN> Also, the function you're referring to is not sws_scale, but an internal static one.
[02:11:00] <yuri6037> by assigning src index 1-2-3 to 0 they assume src is some kind of 4 plane array which is wrong assumption
[02:11:18] <BtbN> It's how its argument it defined.
[02:11:39] <BtbN> It wants an array of 4 buffers. And for safety sake, with packed formats, it sets them all to the same, first, buffer.
[02:11:42] <yuri6037> sws_scale is not taking arrays pointers according to CLion
[02:11:59] <yuri6037> maybe CLion is broken

[02:12:33] <yuri6037> yeah I know i'm looking at swscale I found that in a forum which said that sws_scale is calling that internally

[02:17:56] <yuri6037> it copies srcStride 0-1-2-3 which is wrong if srcStride is just a pointer to  a single int which is the stride of the packed RGB plane
[02:18:33] <yuri6037> Basically in my code I only generate 1 big RGB buffer nothing more
[02:19:08] <yuri6037> this worked fine for decoding as in the code it doesn't assume this for dst it only seem to do this for src
[02:19:11] <BtbN> If you're only passing it a pointer to a single buffer to srdSlice and dst, you're using it wrong.
[02:19:16] <BtbN> It wants an array of 4 buffers.
[02:19:38] <yuri6037> here is the problem: I don't have 4 buffers because it is a packed RGB
[02:19:49] <BtbN> Each buffer corresponding to one plane. In the case of packed formats, all but the first one are NULL
[02:20:05] <yuri6037> and where do you see this in doc?
[02:20:13] <BtbN> https://ffmpeg.org/doxygen/trunk/group__libsws.html#gae531c9754c9205d90ad6800015046d74

[02:21:06] <yuri6037> it doesn't tell you exactly that it wants 4 plane and also doesn't tell you to put it at the end
[02:21:28] <yuri6037> of course I can read the code but ideally they should consider writing proper docs
[02:21:51] <BtbN> It's always 4 planes. There's an FFmpeg wide define for that.

This seems to be working well with `ffmpeg -f x11grab -framerate 10 -i 0:0 myFile.mp4`, however now I'm trying to optimize on filesize. I noticed that in the output, the bitrate is listed as 480 kbits/s
[06:54:37] <ezzieyguywuf> is there a way to adjust this bitrate? is this already a 'low' number? is it possible to encode the video using a variable bitrate?

[07:10:35] <KombuchaKip> I am having a memory leak problem with ffmpeg, or more precisely a "space leak". Memory is being released correctly on my application's exit, but during its run, the more music it decodes, the more memory it seems to use. I've spent a few days profiling, and now with the tcmalloc library. If I'm reading its report correctly, it looks like the majority of the memory was allocated by av_buffer_realloc / av_malloc in this decoder loop. Can
[07:10:39] <KombuchaKip> anyone see what I'm doing wrong? The decode works fine, but obviously something isn't being released when it should: https://pastebin.com/YDdUU0wT

[13:54:05] <yuri6037> seems like libx264 is dropping a huge lot of frames
[13:56:49] <yuri6037> there's worse libx264 is writing the video as 1:07 which is FAR FAR MORE than what the original video was: 00:05 according to VLC
[13:57:12] <JEEB> any encoder does not drop frames
[13:57:17] <JEEB> esp. not x264
[13:57:32] <JEEB> theora was the last thing to actually drop frames when rate control cannot hit your requirements
[13:57:37] <JEEB> as far as I know :P
[13:58:02] <JEEB> slow stuff sounds like you're missing timestamp adjustments like time bases
[13:58:05] <yuri6037> but the matter is the video is not smooth at all you need to wait more than 1 second in order to just see one frame
[13:58:25] <yuri6037> I'm setting the exact time_base and exact frame_rate from original video
[13:58:37] <JEEB> yes but are your timestamps the same across? :P
[13:58:42] <yuri6037> and timestamps are also the ones from the original video
[13:58:45] <JEEB> as in, adjusted for time ase
[13:58:47] <JEEB> *base
[13:59:24] <yuri6037> what do you mean adjusted. I just copy the int64_t from the source video and re-use them as is in the new video
[13:59:40] <JEEB> demux gives you AVPackets on AVStream's time base, you then create a decoder instance which has its own time base, and you have to rescale the timestamps there (there's a helper for that for AVPackets)
[13:59:49] <JEEB> then after you decode you get back AVFrames on the decoder instance's time base
[14:00:01] <JEEB> then filter inputs and outputs have time bases if you have filtering
[14:00:10] <JEEB> then encoder instance has its own time base
[14:00:23] <JEEB> and finally, the muxer's AVStream time base
[14:00:28] <yuri6037> the encoder time_base is set to the one from the decoder
[14:01:07] <JEEB> there's even a nice function to print the time as a string with time base adjusted, just utilize that for debugging in each state with the appropriate time base
[14:01:10] <yuri6037> I'm transfering a lot of parameters from the decoder to the encoder like time_base, frame_rate, has_b_frames, etc
[14:01:30] <JEEB> if your timestamps are wonky, this is the number one issue
[14:01:37] <JEEB> so just start debugging that :P
[14:01:45] <yuri6037> But as I said the time base of the encoder is set to the one of the decoder
[14:01:59] <JEEB> that doesn't mean anything since you clearly are getting not those timestamps you want
[14:02:09] <JEEB> and I cannot see your code with a magical 8ball
[14:02:11] <JEEB> please understand
[14:02:45] <yuri6037> what you say doesn't make sense because I've saved the exact time_base as 2 32 bits ints (num and den)
[14:03:28] <JEEB> sure, I am incorrect then - but at least print out the values with the appropriate time bases then to verify
[14:03:33] <yuri6037> and I save all frame timestamps in the order the decoder gives me the frames and then I reencode them using the same timestamps and give it the same order of frames as the decoder gave me
[14:04:02] <JEEB> order isn't the thing I'm talking about
[14:04:06] <JEEB> you specifically complained about duration
[14:04:14] <yuri6037> yeah duration is wrong
[14:04:18] <JEEB> that is most often a timestamp issue
[14:04:27] <JEEB> you have forgotten some step or so
[14:04:32] <yuri6037> what could it be if not a timestamp issue?
[14:05:09] <yuri6037> it's very unlikely to be a timestamp issue as I'm reusing the exact timestamps the decoder gave me or the decoder gives me garbage
[14:05:45] <JEEB> it could be your player interpreting the timestamps wrong, you can easily verify the timestamps that FFmpeg would read from your output file
[14:06:02] <JEEB> `ffprobe -of json -show_packets -show_streams -i your_output_file`
[14:06:24] <JEEB> that dumps all packets' parsed timestamps from your generated file into JSON
[14:06:36] <JEEB> which you can then parse with python or just inspect the first X packets :P
[14:07:14] <JEEB> or -show_frames for decoded frames from those packets
[14:07:25] <JEEB> so you get constantly rising PTS in case of b-frames
[14:07:40] *** Quits: durandal_1707 (~computer@95.168.121.19) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[14:07:57] <JEEB> and if those timestamps in your output file are weird, then unfortunately the nr1 culprit is your code :P
[14:09:08] <JEEB> which is why I recommend just logging the timestamps for each step if possible. pts divided by the relevant time base (demuxer AVStream, decoder, filter in/out, encoder, muxer AVStream)
[14:09:19] <JEEB> whichever is appropriate for your code base
[14:12:09] <yuri6037> I'm currently running the decoder with prinint all timestamps so I can compare if by any chance saving int64_t somehow corrupted them
[14:14:02] <yuri6037> the intersting part is if I on purpose corrupt the timestamps x264 always generates 0 bytes file
[14:14:58] <yuri6037> and the output video is just a blank file. If I use the timestamps I've saved then I get a video which VLC can play but as I said it looks like a lot of frames are dropped and duration is completely wrong
[14:16:42] <yuri6037> no the timestamps are definatly correct no saving corruption
[14:17:08] <yuri6037> diff says no difference between outut of encoder and decoder regarding frame indices associated to frame timestamps
[14:18:26] <yuri6037> also the generated file is FAR larger
[14:18:43] <yuri6037> 7.3 MB instead of 557kb
[14:20:28] <yuri6037> wow that's strange I just found something weird in VLC codec information of the generated file
[14:20:46] <yuri6037> I get proper H264 but VLC cannot find out the number of FPS
[14:21:07] <yuri6037> even though I've set it when initializing the encoder
[14:21:27] <yuri6037> Is that normal VLC doesn't show any FPS count?
[14:23:01] <JEEB> just look at the output of ffprobe -show_frame for a file
[14:23:04] <JEEB> *frames
[14:23:08] <yuri6037> Here are all the parameters that I set in the codec context from the file: https://pastebin.com/xYfbX1kX
[14:23:37] <JEEB> that will dump the PTS of each encoded frame in that file as readable seconds float for example :P
[14:23:45] <JEEB> if the timestamps look weird, you will see it immediately'ish

[14:55:33] <yuri6037> ok as I said here is the problem: x264 did drop frames: [matroska,webm @ 0x55706e42bb40] File ended prematurely
[14:56:09] <yuri6037> libavcodec/libavformat truncates files
[14:56:35] <yuri6037> exactly 3 frames droped
[14:56:47] <yuri6037> 130 frames on 133 frames needed
[14:57:56] <yuri6037> so the question now is why is the C API truncating files it's supposed to generate?
[14:58:37] <BtbN> Is that output from avformat reading your input, or is that ffmpeg reading the output your code generated?
[14:58:43] <BtbN> Did you forget to write the trailer?
[14:59:00] <BtbN> And did you properly flush the entire chain? Demuxer, decoder, everything.
[15:00:56] <yuri6037> ffprobe -show_frames on output file
[15:01:15] <yuri6037> ffprobe -show_frames on source video gives proper 133 frames
[15:01:56] <yuri6037> however ffprove -show_frames on output file gives "File ended prematurely" and only shows up to 130 frames
[15:02:02] <yuri6037> so 3 frames are dropped
[15:02:18] <yuri6037> and it's not decoding, decoding gives 133 frames
[15:02:27] <yuri6037> it's only when encoding
[15:05:39] <yuri6037> do you have any idea why it's truncating the file?
[15:11:00] <BtbN> Well, it saying "file ended prematurely" is a good indicator that you messed up writing the file, and didn't write the trailer or something.
[15:11:33] <yuri6037> well it's clear that it's missing 3 frames because ffprove only shows up to 130 so it's clear that avformat/avcodec dropped 3 frames but why
[15:12:52] <yuri6037> I've ran the encoder again to see if theres any error but there's no error except a bunch of info starting with "[libx264 @ 0x563455ca4280]"
[15:14:51] <yuri6037> Here is what it says: https://pastebin.com/nDQf8TB4 is this normal?
[15:15:24] <BtbN> That's just normal stats
[15:15:42] <BtbN> But, again: It says your file is damaged, so you did not write it properly. Most likely missing the trailer.
[15:16:08] <BtbN> And missing frames are usually caused by not properly flushing the chain on input EOF
[15:16:08] <yuri6037> what's the trailer?
[15:16:18] <BtbN> The opposite of the header.
[15:16:38] <yuri6037> well I know the definition of a trailer but I have no idea how to write that
[15:16:52] <BtbN> The same way you write the header, just that it's called trailer.
[15:16:53] <yuri6037> and I'm flushing
[15:17:05] <BtbN> I literally linked you to the part of the docs that explains the process yesterday.
[15:18:12] <BtbN> https://ffmpeg.org/doxygen/trunk/group__lavf__encoding.html
[15:18:16] <yuri6037> there is no such function named "avformat_write_trailer"
[15:18:21] <BtbN> "Once all the data has been written, the caller must call av_write_trailer() to flush any buffered packets and finalize the output file"
[15:18:55] <yuri6037> of course it's not named following the same convention
[15:19:16] <BtbN> Mostly history reasons, and changing it now would be a pointless API break
[15:19:21] <BtbN> *historic
[15:21:21] <yuri6037> ok I've added the trailer now
[15:21:38] *** Quits: softworkz (~softworkz@user/softworkz) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[15:22:13] <yuri6037> ah now there's 133 frames that's better
[15:22:27] <yuri6037> and there's no more truncation error in ffprove
[15:22:39] *** Quits: lavaball (felix@31.204.155.215) (Remote host closed the connection)
[15:23:20] <yuri6037> but video is still broken on VLC and VLC still doesn't find the frame rate
[15:23:37] <yuri6037> seems like avformat forgets to write the stream framerate
[15:23:49] <yuri6037> even though I set it in AVCodecContext
[15:26:28] <BtbN> avformat is pretty unfazed by what you tell to avcodec
[15:26:39] <BtbN> And, again, the timestamps govern the framerate.
[15:26:45] <yuri6037> and there's another problem the decoder sends incorrect pts
[15:27:16] <yuri6037> according to ffprobe there should 2 times pts=0 however in the encoded file the first is 0 but the second is 512 not 0
[15:27:38] <BtbN> The decoder does not normally send any pts at all. It just passes through the ones from the packets.
[15:28:00] <yuri6037> but I'm reading pts value in AVFrame
[15:28:15] <BtbN> ... Which is just what was on the packet.
[15:28:15] <yuri6037> so do you mean it doesn't set it properly?
[15:28:27] <BtbN> It does not modify them other than re-ordering
[15:28:33] <yuri6037> what pts does ffprobe get then
[15:28:46] <BtbN> ?
[15:28:57] <yuri6037> I need to get the decoder give me exactly what ffprobe gives me
[15:29:16] <BtbN> The decoder just gives you what it itself got as input.
[15:29:41] <yuri6037> however it does not it breaks the order and misses 1 pts value
[15:29:57] <BtbN> That's practically impossible.

[15:42:11] <MG2021> yuri6037 Are we talking to ourselves?
[15:42:54] <yuri6037> BtbN was helping me a bit
[15:44:06] <BtbN> yuri6037, as the name might suggests, it's on the packet, not the frame.
[15:44:24] <BtbN> avcodec passes it through to the frames it outputs, after re-ordering.
[15:45:11] <yuri6037> then it means when re-encoding frames are not re-ordered properly
[15:46:00] <yuri6037> and that still doesn't answer the question why in the source video there's twice pkt_pts = 0 whereas in my decoded video I only see it once
[15:47:06] <yuri6037> I thought it would be enough to save the timestamps but apparently it's far from enough
[15:47:31] <yuri6037> the timestamps don't match what ffprobe finds and I have no idea why
[15:51:03] <yuri6037> in what order does ffprobe -show_frames give frames? Is it in order of display or in another order?
[15:52:03] <JEEB> it is in the coded image order after b-frame etc reordering
[15:54:23] <yuri6037> is there any way to make the C api give exact same ordering?
[15:54:47] <JEEB> yes, after decoding you get exactly that
[15:54:52] <MG2021> Friends, if you replay, please reply again. I was disconnected
[15:55:04] <JEEB> since ffprobe is a very very shallow wrapper around the basic APIs
[15:55:30] <MG2021> May I ask why ffmpeg does not yet support bink 2 format?
[15:55:33] <yuri6037> no I don't ffprobe gives me 2 times 0 in pkt_pts whereas AVFrame pts is broken
[15:55:47] <another|> MG2021: because nobody implemented it
[15:55:53] <yuri6037> and gives me 0 then 512

[15:56:27] <yuri6037> but then there is a big problem with my Ubuntu version of it because it doesn't give that at all

[17:29:15] <znf> Thanks :)
[17:29:23] <yuri6037> I think I just found a bug in matroska encoder
[17:29:48] <yuri6037> the matroska encoder cannot deal with timestamps correctly whereas the mov encoder can
[17:30:26] <yuri6037> is this normal?
[17:30:48] <another|> something, something timebase?
[17:31:42] <yuri6037> time_base is set to the time_base of the source mov video
[17:31:53] <yuri6037> timestamps are just copied from source video
[17:32:13] <yuri6037> maybe is matroska unable to correctly use time_base of mov videos
[17:32:18] <kepstin> mkv doesn't support arbitrary timebases - the muxer will after initialization update the context with the real timebase
[17:32:23] <kepstin> you need to rescale timestamps
[17:32:31] <yuri6037> ah
[17:32:34] <yuri6037> oh
[17:32:36] <yuri6037> i see
[17:32:40] <kepstin> (this is something you have to do in general with all muxers for correctness)
[17:32:57] <yuri6037> and how do I rescale the timestamps?
[17:33:07] <yuri6037> is there a function for that?
[17:33:46] <yuri6037> of course if MKV doesn't support arbitary time bases it won't work. I thought MKV supported anything you threw at it
[17:34:26] <kepstin> indeed, it even has "rescale" in the name :) https://www.ffmpeg.org/doxygen/trunk/group__lavu__math.html
[17:34:51] <kepstin> (for timebase conversion specifically, i think you want av_rescale_q)
[17:35:12] <kepstin> no, mkv (the format) only supports timebases that are powers of 10
[17:35:24] <kepstin> and i believe the ffmpeg muxer only does 1/1000
[17:36:25] <yuri6037> what about my other question about audio?
[17:36:49] <yuri6037> does avformat correctly re-orders the packets when I'm giving it all audio packets followed by all video packets?
[17:37:08] <kepstin> er, you mean interleave packets?
[17:37:23] <kepstin> i'm... not sure
[17:37:36] <kepstin> even if it does that would require buffering an entire stream in memory which would not be good
[17:38:11] <kepstin> the exact behaviour likely depends on the specific format, but i wouldn't be surprised if you end up filling a buffer somewhere and dropping packets
[17:38:21] <yuri6037> well the source video has audio packets in the middle of video when I'm re-encoding the video I don't have any of the audio packet I just send them first

[17:38:40] <yuri6037> When I tried that I got a weird error
[17:38:54] <yuri6037> Application provided invalid, non monotonically increasing dts to muxer in stream 0: 87040 >=
[17:39:30] <kepstin> well, that means that your timestamps within a single stream are bad, has nothing to do with multiple different streams
[17:40:18] <yuri6037> the timestamps of the audio stream are not changed
[17:41:29] <yuri6037> so I give it basically all audio packets in whatever order they come and then I give it all my video frames which go through first RGB to YUV re-encoding and then to write_interleaved_frame
[17:41:30] <galad> Are you muxing video and audio to the same track?
[17:41:42] <yuri6037> no I make 2 streams
[17:41:51] <yuri6037> 1 for audio and 1 for video
[17:42:02] <galad> Make sure they are going to the right stream
[17:42:33] <yuri6037> is there any way to detect the stream index of the AVFormatContext?
[17:42:37] <galad> And you really should interleave them before
[17:44:06] <yuri6037> I know I should but nobody told me that I should do this before meaning that now to do this I'd need to change completely the decoding process and that would also require give read access to the AVFrame buffer to Rust for rust to write but I have no idea how AVFrame buffer works
[17:45:24] <yuri6037> and considering the alignment issues it's most likely impossible to write it in my database BPX as it only accepts contiguous u8 buffer with total size given
[17:47:55] <MG202122> manx
[17:47:55] <MG202122> ePirat: as far as i know, ffmpeg opus encoder does not support silk, which makes it inferior for certain use cases (my information might be outdated). ffmpeg itself recommends not using their own vorbis encoder (https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/TheoraVorbisEncodingGuide).
[17:48:07] <kepstin> yuri6037: the stream indexes will be the order that you created the streams on the format context, starting at 0
[17:48:19] <yuri6037> kepstin: how do I get the time_base that ffmpeg uses for the H264 encoder?
[17:48:33] <yuri6037> when I create it for MKV
[17:49:16] <kepstin> you should already know the timebase of the frames you sent to the encoder (and you've also set that in the codec context)
[17:49:39] <kepstin> so you have to rescale from that to the timebase of the stream in the output format
[17:50:05] <yuri6037> yes and that's the problem how do I know the timebase that FFMPEG chooses for MKV?
[17:50:24] <kepstin> it updates the stream structure during initialization
[17:50:37] <another|> doesn't matroska only support 1/1000 ?
[17:50:38] <kepstin> ah, right, the method you actually want to rescale packet timestamps is https://www.ffmpeg.org/doxygen/trunk/group__lavc__packet.html#gae5c86e4d93f6e7aa62ef2c60763ea67e
[17:50:54] <kepstin> matroska (the format) supports various powers of 10.
[17:51:06] <kepstin> matroska (the ffmpeg muxer) only supports 1/1000 as far as i know
[17:51:06] <another|> ah, sorry. just read it in the backlog
[17:51:36] <yuri6037> can I hardcode this 1/1000 or is there some define for me to use?

[17:53:32] <kepstin> you need to rescale the packet timestamps from the AVCodecContext->time_base to the AVStream->time_base using the av_packet_rescale_ts function.

[18:19:07] <kepstin> but i think ffmpeg ends up using the microsoft 'audio codec manager' mapping in those cases, which limits you to approximately "whatever could be stored in avi"

[18:31:31] <kepstin> you can use the "-vn" to drop video, or "-map" option to select specific streams
[18:31:55] <kepstin> (you should also set codec options on the output, right now it's transcoding to something random)

[20:20:46] <yuri6037> in other words because of their annoying ideology they prefer to annoy users and loose users
[20:22:18] <furq> that's just lazy from opencv if they can't figure out how to include gplv3 stuff

[20:23:52] <yuri6037> on windows you can just drop OpenH264.dll in the app dir alongside your python script and it will use it
[20:24:37] <yuri6037> on linux they tell you more or less f*** y** and go build ffmpeg yourself
[20:25:11] <yuri6037> at least on Pop OS installing ffmpeg installs all codecs even the x264 codec
[20:26:00] <furq> yeah it does that more or less everywhere
[20:26:01] <yuri6037> which is very nice from System76 unfortunatly my research machine is not running Pop OS but an old Ubuntu which of course doesn't have proper lib versions

[20:44:05] <kepstin> well, libc, libm, libpthread area all just glibc

[20:47:47] <BtbN> If you want to compile C code that works on an older version of glibc, the only sane way to do that is to actually use that old glibc to build it.
[20:48:22] <BtbN> The binaries my scripts output right now target Ubuntu >=16.04

[20:48:58] <kepstin> (rust also has an option to staticly link musl if you really want portable binaries, heh)
[20:49:09] <yuri6037> yeah but I don't have a build machine to rebuild all these libs. Do you have a prebuilt version?
[20:49:23] <BtbN> I literally just linked it...
[20:50:28] <yuri6037> you don't have 58
[20:50:34] <yuri6037> only 59 and 57
[20:50:42] <BtbN> So?
[20:50:57] <yuri6037> I need avcodec avformat and swscale 58 otherwise it will tell me that the libs are missing
[20:51:04] <BtbN> What's "it"?
[20:51:11] <yuri6037> ldd
[20:51:21] <BtbN> Recompile against latest master then.
[20:52:07] <BtbN> And just ship the ffmpeg libs along your stuff
[20:52:31] <yuri6037> again as I said I don't have a build machine to build the huge code base of ffmpeg
[20:52:44] <BtbN> And again: I just linked you to a build...
[20:53:04] <yuri6037> but I just told you that your build is not the one I need
[20:53:12] <BtbN> You're not making sense.
[20:53:15] <yuri6037> I need the .so.58 version
[20:53:23] <yuri6037> you provide the .so.57
[20:53:27] <yuri6037> and .so.59
[20:53:29] <BtbN> Just re-compile and re-link your stuff, the archive has all the neccesary files for that.
[20:53:50] <BtbN> And then ship the libraries alongside your binary
[20:53:56] <yuri6037> the thing is don't control the link part cmake controls it
[20:54:02] <kepstin> rebuild your code to use BtbN's libraries instead of the ones provided by your distro
[20:54:13] <yuri6037> find_library(AVCODEC_LIB avcodec)
[20:54:29] <BtbN> Tell cmake to use my libs then, and not the system ones
[20:54:31] <yuri6037> yes but as I said cmake controls the build so it's not possible to make it use this libs
[20:54:39] <BtbN> Of course it's possible
[20:55:01] <yuri6037> you need to provide a .cmake for your package
[20:55:34] <yuri6037> and there's no libx264
[20:55:45] <BtbN> libx264 is statically linked into it
[20:55:51] <yuri6037> oh ok
[20:55:52] <BtbN> as is a whole ton of other libs
[20:56:05] <BtbN> https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/variable/CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH.html#variable:CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH
[20:56:18] <BtbN> find_library does not look for any .cmake files
[20:56:24] <BtbN> it just does a dumb search for an .so file
[20:56:57] <BtbN> https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/variable/CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH.html same for the include path
[20:58:10] <kepstin> BtbN: have you looked into providing pc files in your shared build? (I'm not sure if it's possible to make relocatable pc files tho, not that familiar with the format)
[20:58:46] <BtbN> How would I sensibly do that? They hardcode absolute paths
[20:58:59] <BtbN> I could ship .pc.in files and a simple Makefile or something I guess.
[20:59:30] <BtbN> But if that cmake script just does "find_library(AVCODEC_LIB avcodec)", it won't care about .pc files anyway
[20:59:37] <kepstin> hmm. i wonder if the pkg-config "uninstalled" stuff supports relative paths.
[21:00:09] <BtbN> I don't think so
[21:00:16] <BtbN> seems to be pretty dead set on absolute paths
[21:01:48] <kepstin> ah, that's annoying :/ would be nice if it could be done to make it easier to use your builds with stuff that does use pkg-config to find ffmpeg, but I guess i most cases there's some way to manually add include and linking flags anyways.
[21:02:54] <yuri6037> well I've tried it it doesn't work: gmake[3]: *** No rule to make target '/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libavcodec.so', needed by 'libCInterface.so'.  Stop.
[21:04:11] <kepstin> oh, interesting, you can use "${pcfiledir}" as a variable in pc files (the directory the pc file is in) and then build paths relative to that
[21:04:36] *** Joins: emcodem (uid483343@id-483343.helmsley.irccloud.com)
[21:05:22] <emcodem> good evening ladies and gentlemen!
[21:05:23] <yuri6037> I guess I'm gonna have to ditch completely the find_library and use direct absolute path to libs
[21:05:43] <emcodem> this is not 100% ffmpeg related but i try to read from stdout output of ffmpeg in a C++ program ("my program spawned ffmpeg commandline")
[21:05:46] <kepstin> BtbN: so (assuming the pc files are in .../lib/pkgconfig/) you could do prefix=${pcfiledir}/../.. then the rest of the file as normal.
[21:05:54] <emcodem> looks like no matter which buffer size i set to read from stdout, i will usually only get a maximum of 65536 per read cycle
[21:06:32] <emcodem> anyone accidently knows if this "pipe limit" for stdout piping can be influenced?
[21:06:44] <kepstin> emcodem: there's limits on the pipe buffer (in the kernel) between applications. This limit can usually be adjusted. But i would have though the default is larger than 54k, hmm.
[21:06:45] <emcodem> on windows
[21:06:47] <kepstin> 64k*
[21:06:55] <kepstin> oh, no idea on windows.
[21:07:10] <emcodem> yeeah on linux i found how it's done already
[21:07:12] <emcodem> hehe
[21:07:15] <BtbN> yuri6037, no you don't. I linked you to the env vars you have to set and point at my build.
[21:07:49] <yuri6037> I just tried it doesn't work I'll go and hardcode the path with CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR
[21:08:03] <BtbN> I can assure you, it works fine.
[21:08:10] <BtbN> Done that plenty of times
[21:12:08] <yuri6037> ok I've just hardcoded the paths and now it build and links
