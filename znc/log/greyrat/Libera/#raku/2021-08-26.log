[02:01:48] <gfldex> lizmat: I'm gonna ask Santa if we can borrow the multiverse branch slitter, so you can test your stuff in a non-production branch of reality.
[02:02:37] <gfldex> Whereby I'm not convinced anymore that *this* branch of reality was meant to be used in production.
[02:03:49] <perryprog> What's the worst is when someone runs the live branch of reality under lldb and it hits a breakpoint
[02:16:14] <ugexe> every action is already a multiverse branch splitter
[02:16:44] <ugexe> maybe a multiverse map reduce
[02:17:11] <gfldex> the checkout is the difficult part
[02:17:20] <gfldex> and there seams to be no revert
[02:17:51] <ugexe> oh a git branch, and not a multiverse branching event

[19:19:22] <Altreus> Academic interest: how can one represent the concept of, e.g., 6pm, abstracted from any particular day?
[19:19:47] <Altreus> For example, maybe I hold a 6pm object and wish to apply it to an arbitrary calendar date
[19:21:26] <ugexe> 6pm might not exist on a given day
[19:21:47] <Altreus> right
[19:21:48] <ugexe> more familiar, 6am or some such might not during DST
[19:22:16] <Altreus> That shouldn't forbid me from trying
[19:22:43] <Altreus> The mechanism would of course take into account the fact some days have no 2am and some days have two
[19:23:18] <ugexe> take a date object and add the appropriate number of hours. if that number of hours falls during the hour time loss of DST then it would likely error (similar to how perl DateTime would)
[19:23:20] <Altreus> One would quite reasonably wish, for example, to separate the time of a meeting from the day, so it could be "every day at 6pm"
[19:23:46] <ugexe> unless date is tied too close to particular day
[19:23:48] <Altreus> so what would one do in order to represent an event that is "every day at 6pm"?
[19:25:10] <andinus> should reference to freenode on learnxinyminutes/raku be changed to libera?
[19:25:23] <Altreus> I suppose the UI would have to handle the problem when that time can't be represented for a given day
[19:31:18] <lizmat> andinus: yes
[19:33:25] <Altreus> lizmat: I watched your sigils video and I might actually have learned something
[19:34:01] <andinus> lizmat: created a PR https://github.com/adambard/learnxinyminutes-docs/pull/4224 with some other fixes
[19:47:03] <japhb> Altreus: I would think that standard calendar invite formats would need to support that kind of thing, and even more detail like "Every 3rd Wednesday at 9 AM in America/Los_Angeles TZ" ... maybe look at iCal (or whatever the current equivalent is)?
[19:47:17] <Juerd> Altreus: 6pm can be abstracted as an increase of 18 hours past the day boundary, which can be stored as a pair, my $offset = :18hours; my $today18pm = Date.today.DateTime.later(|$offset)
[19:48:15] <Juerd> s/18pm/6pm/  # am/pm sucks.
[19:48:42] <japhb> Juerd: "3rd bell"?  :-)
[19:48:54] <Juerd> ?
[19:49:28] <ugexe> 6pm cant be represented as X hours past a day boundry for DST reasons. if e.g. 3am is skipped for DST then 3 hours past the day would be 4am
[19:49:40] <Juerd> ugexe: Ah, right
[19:49:41] <Altreus> Juerd: not on DST change days
[19:49:44] <japhb> Juerd: Some cultures would have town or church bells ring at certain times of day, so you might say you were meeting someone at "third bell".
[19:49:45] <Altreus> right
[19:50:01] <Juerd> 24-18 hours before the next day boundary, at least until dst change time moves ;)
[19:51:12] <Altreus> luckily that's 2am on purpose
[19:51:15] <Altreus> at least here
[19:51:29] <Juerd> Now, 2am itself is much harder to represent :)
[19:51:43] <Juerd> Or, 2:01. There might be two of those, or none.
[19:52:18] <japhb> The annoying thing is when you have a regular meeting with someone in a different TZ with different DST rules.  Then your meetings will shift around 4 times a year (shifting on and off DST, in 2 different zones).  Heavens help you if you have to deal with 3 zones.  At my previous company, we just started setting all those meetings in UTC, and letting people do their local calculations.
[19:52:24] <Altreus> that is what ugexe meant for the general case, yes
[19:52:31] <Altreus> a given time may not exist every day
[19:52:34] <japhb> Of course, then you had UTC and non-UTC meetings conflicting at DST changes ....
[19:52:59] <Altreus> imagine if a meeting were at 2am in the UK because it's at a sensible time in the US or somewhere like that
[19:53:20] <Juerd> 2am is an okay time for a party to end
[19:53:20] <ugexe> that is generally how it works lol
[19:53:38] <Altreus> And then it happened to be on that Sunday morning when we change to GMT
[19:53:50] <Altreus> so it's either at 1am or at 1am
[19:53:56] <ugexe> ive never worked somewhere where they catered meetings to outside of US besides an occasional second meeting at different hours
[19:54:10] <japhb> Altreus: Working with a team literally on the opposite side of the earth (so ~12 hours apart) or spaced around the world (6-8 hours apart, 3-4 different zones) is *really* hard.
[19:54:13] <Altreus> how on earth would you tell the UK resident when it is
[19:54:26] <ugexe> their calander software translate it for them
[19:54:26] <Altreus> It's not at 2am because that's 2 hours after 1am... and also 1 hour after 1am
[19:54:42] <Altreus> presumably the calendar itself just shows 1am twice
[19:54:48] <Altreus> never thought of that... hang on
[19:55:37] <Altreus> nope
[19:56:06] <ugexe> sorry, you only worked 7 hours today
[19:56:52] <japhb> I guarantee you every joke we've made so far about getting time handling wrong has been done umpteen times in real business software
[19:57:20] <ugexe> sure, hell ive seen most of these personally
[20:01:33] <Altreus> Looks like Google's calendar just keeps showing me GMT+1 times even when I look at GMT+0 days
[20:02:52] <japhb> I'm mildly surprised gcal is getting it wrong, simply from sheer number of people who have been using it for a long time
[20:05:38] <Altreus> ipad calendar also has 24 sequential hours
[20:06:33] <Altreus> hah I just realised my birthday is on the shortest day but my anniversary is on the longest day, by different metrics
[20:07:47] <Altreus> I suppose BST end is not the same date every year :(

[20:15:17] <Altreus> > Time zones are handled as Integers in seconds offset from UTC, not by time zone name.
[20:15:30] <Altreus> Is there a thing that uses zoneinfo to choose the right timezone for the given DateTime?
[20:17:01] <japhb> Altreus: There's this module: https://raku.land/github:raku-community-modules/DateTime::TimeZone
[20:17:21] <Altreus> ta
[20:18:59] <Altreus> hmmmmmmmm
[20:20:54] <Altreus> takes a while to test:/
[20:28:33] <Altreus> takes a while to install ... weird
[20:29:18] <ugexe> well it contains hundreds of modules, all of which have to be precompiled
[20:30:13] <gfldex> they all look like this: https://github.com/raku-community-modules/DateTime-TimeZone/blob/master/lib/DateTime/TimeZone/Zone/Turkey.pm6
[20:30:49] <Altreus> I ^C'd it to try again with --verbose and now it thinks it's installed :D
[20:30:56] <Altreus> I guess I'll force a reinstall
[20:31:29] <lizmat> https://github.com/raku-community-modules/DateTime-TimeZone/blob/master/lib/DateTime/TimeZone/Zone/Africa/Accra.pm6   # more complicated ones
[20:31:59] <lizmat> although it looks like these could also be represented by JSON files, and thus skip the precomp penalty?
[20:32:03] <ugexe> RAKU_LOG_PRECOMP=1 will show each file being precompiled during the install phase
[20:32:09] <Altreus> aha
[20:32:56] <Altreus> isn't there a C library that could be exposed?
[20:34:31] <gfldex> it uses require to load the module for a specific timezone when needed and I can't spot any caching
[20:34:45] <gfldex> is require doing the caching here?
[20:34:50] <gfldex> https://github.com/raku-community-modules/DateTime-TimeZone/blob/master/lib/DateTime/TimeZone.pm6
[20:34:59] <Altreus> iana provide timezone data as TSV
[20:35:17] <Altreus> in a badly-behaved tarbomb
[20:35:30] <Altreus> I guess it's more of a tar pellet
[20:35:40] <ugexe> installation precompiles everything
[20:35:59] <Altreus> > tz-offset 'Europe/London'
[20:36:36] <Altreus> If this isn't how one is supposed to provide the timezone that should definitely be documented, because this is how the database does it
[20:37:28] <Altreus> It says it's an invalid string
[20:38:28] <Altreus> oh, it wanted '-0800' or something
[20:39:49] <gfldex> the TSV can be found in https://github.com/raku-community-modules/DateTime-TimeZone/tree/master/tools/tzdata
[20:40:16] <gfldex> so it might be outdated already
[20:40:34] <japhb> Altreus: I think you're supposed to use &timezone if you want to use the string form
[20:41:18] <Altreus> ah I reaed "only tz-offset is supported" as "only tz-offset is implemented"
[20:41:32] <Altreus> the other ones are doing stuff, some of which is erroring, but it's not supported, so that's OK :D
[20:41:39] <gfldex> The module provides 2019a. IANA calles 2021a latest.
[20:42:00] <Altreus> Difficult to decouple these things sadly
[20:42:11] <Altreus> You can't really have an "update tz data but not the module"
[20:43:48] <gfldex> Is there any OS that doesn't provide TZ data?
[20:45:01] <Altreus> that was my next question, or my previous question, depending on how you feel about "isn't there a C library that could be exposed?"
[20:46:20] <Altreus> All this was me trying to figure out what Raku does if I ask for 2am on October 31st
[20:46:34] <Altreus> But currently there's nothing that can get to the point where it moans about it
[20:47:36] <Altreus> anyway, I feel like there's a gap, because that day is 25 hours long, so there must be a time I can't get to
[20:48:16] <Altreus> I think I'm describing a solved problem that I've only just realised exists :D
