[05:32:53] <digitok> use sed -E
[05:33:14] <digitok> what you're doing there is creating a capture group rather than specifying literal parens
[05:33:29] <digitok> with -E the behaviour is reversed (aka made standard)
[05:33:54] <digitok> without -E you'd want unescaped ()
[05:34:37] <digitok> but it's probably a good idea to use -E since you'll come across other weird behaviour with standard BRE (basic regex)
[05:34:42] <digitok> -E is extended
[05:35:47] <yitz> Ah. Cross posted. Nicely done, FuZi0N 
[05:35:56] <FuZi0N> sorry :/
[05:35:58] <digitok> :/
[05:36:02] <yitz> 3 channels!
[05:36:03] <FuZi0N> but got a great explanation here :)
[05:36:07] * FuZi0N busted
[05:36:12] * FuZi0N hides in a corner
[05:37:34] <yitz> Unless there's even more I missed?
[05:38:36] <FuZi0N> 4
[05:38:46] <digitok> (more)
[05:38:47] <digitok> :D
[05:38:56] <FuZi0N> if i'm being honest :S
[05:39:10] <digitok> at least we won the competition
[05:39:19] <FuZi0N> yes
[05:39:24] <FuZi0N> only got the -E sugesstion here though
[05:39:38] <FuZi0N> along with the explanation
[05:39:39] <FuZi0N> :)
[05:39:56] <yitz> #bash and #sed often assume you know what flags do if you've added them to the command
[05:41:12] <digitok> in this case it was that he didn't add any flags
[05:41:31] <yitz> Ah. My bad
[05:41:55] <digitok> they just don't aim to please like #regex does
[05:42:44] <FuZi0N> #regex FTW!
[05:42:59] <yitz> That's not ... wrong. They tend to be more succint and to the point with responses. This channel does tend to be more newbie friendly and go on a bit longer with explanations.
[05:46:23] <digitok> they're just bitter old linux users :p

[18:21:01] <re101-rabbit-97> Need ECMAScript regex to determine if the total number of digits is odd. For example, 111 should match. 1234 should fail.  
[18:21:58] <re101-rabbit-97> Seemingly would be easy to find, but having difficulty finding one.
[18:23:59] <digitok> "123".match(/\d/g).length % 2
[18:30:27] <re101-rabbit-97> Thanks but need pure regex
[18:31:00] <digitok> why
[18:31:24] <digitok> just curious
[18:34:10] <re101-rabbit-97> The code I'm working on provides hard coded regex patterns and I want to change those only and not add code to accomplish.
[18:35:04] <digitok> fair enough
[18:36:38] <OnlineCop> re101-rabbit-97: Are digits separated by whitespace, punctuation, etc.?
[18:36:54] <digitok> ^\D*\d\D*(?:\d\D*\d\D*)*$
[18:37:14] <re101-rabbit-97> whitespace is ok and optional

[18:38:06] <purplex> ^(?=(?:\d\d)*$) even length check
[18:38:07] <OnlineCop> In your example, '111' is three digits long (an odd number of digits). '1234' is four digits long (an even number of digits).
[18:38:29] <OnlineCop> Wouldn't that also match 0-length strings?
[18:38:38] <digitok> i think he knows that :>

[18:39:28] <digitok> 07re101-rabbit-97, just ignore these 2 and use my suggestion
[18:40:10] <OnlineCop> The `\D*\d\D*` in that makes me worry about '1,234'.
[18:40:21] <digitok> not that one

[18:41:01] <digitok> i clarified for your benefit
[18:41:05] <OnlineCop> Nothing. I thought you had re-typed the same thing. I didn't immediately see that you inserted " 2nd"
[18:49:33] <re101-rabbit-97> Thank you so much all. I have more than I asked! Both cases that work even and odd. Now to integrate with my existing regex.

[19:05:42] <re101-rabbit-97> As you can see, the end of the exp looks for 2 series of digits 1 to 5 times with an optional space between. So how to integrate the ^(?=(?:\d\d)*$) to match even number of occurrences of those digits with an optional space
[19:05:48] <re101-rabbit-97> Test cases are:
[19:06:30] <re101-rabbit-97> the following should PASS

[19:13:26] <OnlineCop> I see a "0" (an odd number of digits, but an even value) followed by a "3": line 1 has no space between them (so "03" is an even number of digits) while line 2 has a space (so "0 3").

[19:14:53] <OnlineCop> "0 3" both have 1 digit, so combined, there's an even number of digits (2 digits). "03 29" both have 2 digits (4 total), so that's also an even number.
[19:15:06] <OnlineCop> What about "1 23"?
[19:15:45] <re101-rabbit-97> That's correct. "1 23" should fail because it's an odd number of total digits.
[19:15:51] <OnlineCop> Or "1 234" (combined is 4 digits, so "even number"), but they number of digits in the first group is different from the number of digits in the 2nd group.

[19:16:16] <re101-rabbit-97> Correct
[19:16:40] <OnlineCop> Is "1 234" valid (4 total digits) or invalid ("1" digit followed by "3" digits)?

[19:33:45] <OnlineCop> I probably also need to shorten the `(?:\d{2}){0,4}` as well, since 3 and 4 "double digits" will be 6-8 digits long, and that shouldn't pass.
[19:34:04] <OnlineCop> `(?:\d{2}){0,2}` is probably the max you could go on those.

[21:35:42] <pi0> what does the : represent
[21:35:52] <Timvde> (?: ) is a non-capturing group
[21:36:05] <Timvde> If you're a beginner, you can just ignore it and use simple ( ) for grouping
[21:36:12] <Timvde> It's just a habit of mine to use (?: ) instead
[21:36:24] <pi0> non-capturing group, can you clearify on that 
[21:36:33] <pi0> yep complete newbie :)
[21:36:50] <pi0> taking a linkend online course
[21:36:53] <pi0> or lecture really
[21:37:03] <Timvde> Well, I mostly need to explain what a capturing group is: if you use ( ), the regex engine will "capture" what's inside, and you can refer to it later with \1, \2 etc (for the first, second... group)
[21:37:25] <Timvde> So for example (ab)\1 matches abab, because (ab) captures "ab" and \1 repeats what was captured
[21:37:40] <Timvde> Using (?: ) does not capture, so it is slightly more efficient
