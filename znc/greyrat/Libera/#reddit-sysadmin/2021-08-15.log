[04:07:05] <shibboleth> as i've said: they also got their information from somewhere. not unrelated/irrelevant
[04:08:51] <shibboleth> as for vaccines? well, all our current vaccines target the same property/attack vector of the virus, the longer it gets to "mutate" the higher the risk of a variant which leaves us back close to square one
[04:10:15] <corn266> kek
[04:11:21] <corn266> imagine thinking the primary cause of the meraks disease's increasing lethality isn't doing the same with covid

[04:37:04] <catbeard> primarily it's used on navy carriers to ward off pirates from a great distance
[04:37:04] <corn266> i remember quipping about it with the cheif of security of a major govt agency when it first occured

[04:38:14] <catbeard> LRAD doesn't do that, that's something else

[04:41:23] <shibboleth> wifi, 5ghz, 6ghz even
[04:41:51] <corn266> shit that has a resonent frequency with water
[04:41:57] <corn266> ya dome ass
[04:42:07] <shibboleth> it has way, *way* less penetration that the lower freqs
[04:42:26] <corn266> sure

[04:44:08] <shibboleth> ultraviolet light, however, has negative properties
[04:44:23] <catbeard> you can disband cops by calling someone to set fire to a cruiser a few blocks away
[04:44:26] <catbeard> :D
[04:44:36] <corn266> that's the point that i'm worried about, but it gets conflated with the "5G is gonna melt your skeleton" bull shit
[04:44:41] <shibboleth> but there's a respectable gap between 30-300 ghz and there. and you'll find both infrared and visible light in between

[07:11:42] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> The original PC bus was developed by a team led by Mark Dean at IBM as part of the IBM PC project in 1981.[2] It was an 8-bit bus based on the I/O bus of the IBM System/23 Datamaster system - it used the same physical connector, and a similar signal protocol and pinout.
[07:12:00] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> A 16-bit version, the IBM AT bus, was introduced with the release of the IBM PC/AT in 1984. In 1988, the 32-bit EISA standard was proposed by the "Gang of Nine" group of PC-compatible manufacturers that included Compaq. Compaq created the term "Industry Standard Architecture" (ISA) to replace "PC compatible".[4] In the process, they retroactively renamed the AT bus to "ISA" to avoid infringing IBM's trademark on its PC and PC/AT systems.

[11:57:32] <Kiernian> Admittedly, I don't keep up, but that doesn't seem like a particularly bad price for a 550gb ssd

[11:59:03] <sd> 05<N​ick1296> Laptop is 8 years old, lacks M.2 (yep... this is from Dell's mSATA phase and mSATA is a useless standard IMO) and the battery is meh health at 64% health.

[12:07:52] <Kiernian> so...the problem is that it's too cheap? It's probably been sitting on a pallet for 5 years as part of warranty rotation stock somewhere, but that doesn't automatically make it bad.

[12:10:24] <Kiernian> ah, I hear you there. I've been rocking a Lenovo Thinkpad T440 for 6 years and change now for personal use, but my main problem with that if anything goes out is how crappy the casing is to open.
