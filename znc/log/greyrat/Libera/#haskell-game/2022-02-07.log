[19:50:36] <ManofLetters[m]> I hope 8.10.8 will fix this: https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/homepage/-/merge_requests/96/diffs

[20:59:30] <f-a> what specifically ManofLetters[m] ? (I don‚Äôt see a specific line pointed out)
[21:10:56] * ManofLetters[m] waves hands vaguely
[21:11:26] <ManofLetters[m]> "We do plan one final 8.10.8 release, fixing a few issues on AArch64 (#20722, #20617)"
[21:11:59] <f-a> oh
[21:12:00] <f-a> ohhhh
[21:12:12] <f-a> btw I fixed my ghc issues by installing intel-microcode
[21:12:24] <f-a> which tells how much I know about computing
[21:12:29] <f-a> vrms is a bit dsadder
[21:21:23] <ManofLetters[m]> I assume you are on AArch64? Or did I get it all completely wrong?
[21:36:44] <f-a> nope, I was with an old lappy
[21:37:02] <f-a> now I am amd64 (is that Debianspeak?)
[21:37:51] <sm> f-a, I haven't read the details but that sounded ugly, congrats on the fix
[21:38:23] <ManofLetters[m]> f-a:  oh, sorry, no offense indtended ;) and congrats indeed
[21:38:24] <sm> things are hard enough without cpu bugs !
[21:38:39] <f-a> sm: it was ugly, segfault when using cabal. All this years I thought microcode updates were for efficiency etc. not to unbreak processors
[21:38:43] <f-a> that left me a bit anxious
[21:39:15] <f-a> bgamari diagnosed it relatively quickly though, I would have not known where to start
[21:39:32] <sm> reminds me of the old days with a home-built PC and random lockups
[21:39:32] <f-a> ManofLetters[m]: none taken! I loved my ARM lappy and in the future I want one
[21:39:41] <f-a> https://genesi.company/products/smartbook ‚ô•
[21:40:26] <sm> er wait... I still get random lockups... but, less often/less random
[21:40:36] <f-a> it only happened with ghc, so they must be using a wide range of instructions
[21:43:57] <ManofLetters[m]> and 'amd64' is true and just, a reminder of the times when Intel claimed 32bits ought to be enough for everybody, because Intel's 32bit processors were selling just fine and it didn't want disruption
[21:44:50] <ManofLetters[m]> and Windows almost had the special hacks needed to access > 4G RAM working
[21:45:29] <ManofLetters[m]> but you should really spend you money on CPU not RAM, 4GB is plenty
[21:46:04] <icrbow[m]> And who needs ECC if you only got 4GB...
[21:46:40] <EvanR> wait you get random lockups too?
[21:47:00] <EvanR> why is tech regressing
[21:49:47] <ManofLetters[m]> There is something I have to tell you all: I'm getting random lockups (rarely)
[21:52:02] <EvanR> it was much worse when I first bought the cpu, linux alerts about MCE errors over once a minute, then freeze
[21:52:16] <sm> if I had ECC would I never get a lockup ? Bet I still would
[21:54:43] <f-a> it saddens me, again preppers my not be wrong in hoarding slide rules
[21:55:11] <f-a> (ot: btw slide ruler game https://www.sliderules.org/react/osiris_artefact.html )
[21:55:59] <ManofLetters[m]> wow, amazing
[21:56:42] <EvanR> slide rules because merica. None of that chinese abacus shit that is likely going to be more useful
[21:59:41] <f-a> well If I had to choose I would get a hardcopy or logarithm(sp) tables and ùëß-value tables 
[22:00:09] <f-a> I have seen people doing amazingly fast calculations on the abacus, but really for multiplication/division you cannot beat logs
[22:00:34] <EvanR> guess what you do with logs, add and subtract them xD
[22:01:02] <f-a> :P yeah
[22:01:04] <EvanR> I find addition harder to do mentally than multiplication and division
[22:01:11] <ManofLetters[m]> so better to store some hardwood logs, too
[22:01:40] <f-a> are you serious? which method do you use? they should be more difficult to do (√ó /) than +
[22:01:52] <EvanR> "just thinking about it"
[22:02:12] <f-a> when I was younger I self produced these https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napier%27s_bones 
[22:02:23] <EvanR> maybe it's that usually they want exact addition and approximate multiplication division of reals
