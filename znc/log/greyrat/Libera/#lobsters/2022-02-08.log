[02:29:30] <ToddDead> has anyone on here gotten into graphics dev from web dev?

[02:29:56] <ToddDead> curious about how they managed the transition
[02:30:26] <technomancy> ToddDead: I've done some game dev but all pretty basic 2D stuff; nothing more complex than raycasting
[02:30:41] <ToddDead> yeah that's where I'm at these days too
[02:31:02] <ToddDead> I'm working on a 2d roguelike with SDL
[02:31:07] <ToddDead> its a lot of fun
[02:31:19] <ToddDead> but I'm teaching myself graphics on the side
[02:31:29] <ToddDead> tilemaps are tricky in 2d games I realized
[02:31:52] <ToddDead> raycasting seems like a cool technique
[02:32:19] <ToddDead> the game dev world these days seems fixated on using proprietary engines like Unity and unreal
[02:32:25] <technomancy> I wrote a blog post about my ray caster

[02:37:05] <bkhl> The alpha might be a bit crashy still, but I've heard good things about that feature.
[02:37:35] <ToddDead> yeah right now, I wrote a simple 2d tilemap of my own, it is very rudimentary 2d array with layers, and it works for my very simple game
[02:37:47] <ToddDead> learnt a lot making that

[02:49:24] <ToddDead> been working a software clerk job at a corp writing glue code
[02:51:19] <ToddDead> I don't know how anything I work with works under the hood as the hard parts are all implemented by people with Phds so to say
[02:51:37] <ToddDead> been the model for the couple jobs I've had
[02:52:13] <ToddDead> I thought moving to the backend would fix this(I used to be a front end guy), but nope, its the same crap
[02:52:37] <ToddDead> they grill you on system design and then when you sign up you're gluing lambdas together and working with crap AWS services
[02:52:46] <kline> 23:09 <technomancy> it's great because you are just kinda forced to accept that your game will be janky and un-polished
[02:52:48] <kline> this is what makes gamejams focus on the bit that matters: when the time constraints put an artificially low ceiling on the time and ability to polish your implementation, what stands out is the game concept and intent
[02:52:58] <ToddDead> I like that idea
[02:53:10] <kline> theres a big difference between game design and game development, and when you squish the development side out, its the creative design that shines

[13:53:23] <gerikson> wb vladimyr
[13:55:41] <vladimyr> How's your day going?
[13:58:26] <gerikson> not too bad
[13:58:31] <gerikson> 2 weeks left at this place of work
[13:58:34] <gerikson> need to wrap up
[13:59:03] <vladimyr> Already have a new gig arranged?
[14:03:10] <gerikson> yes
[14:03:27] <gerikson> 3 months notice
[14:04:36] <vladimyr> So what it is going to be if you don't mind asking?
[14:04:59] <gerikson> same kind - product support, but they're planning to transitiomn me to development after some time
[14:08:26] <varjag> oh man
[14:08:39] <varjag> gerikson: bang your fist on the table or it'll never happen :p
[14:09:28] <varjag> speaking of, it's salary reneg month here..
[14:10:41] <gerikson> varjag: yeah I will have to be proactive
[14:11:07] <vladimyr> varjag: aiming for 10 percent or more, gotta include inflation in that equation :)
[14:12:08] <varjag> gerikson: imo you're way overqualified for product support
[14:12:26] <vladimyr> ^ agree
[14:12:47] <gerikson> varjag: well yeah they kinda thought so too :D
[14:12:50] <gerikson> bbl luinch
[14:13:31] <reneeontheweb> we just had ours, i organized the engineers and made us all negotiate very aggressively, it went great. i got 30% including promotion and coworkers got around that somewhere
[14:14:44] <varjag> oh wow
[14:14:47] <vladimyr> Wow, you created an union, nicely played!
[14:14:52] <reneeontheweb> solidarity works!
[14:15:31] <vladimyr> Send over that application link :D
[14:18:23] <reneeontheweb> If you're serious I'll DM it, idk what the hiring situation looks after we were recently acquired, but it's a cool team and we always need more folks:)
[14:20:03] <vladimyr> Nah, I'm fine with my current gig but appreciate the offer!
[14:21:24] <vladimyr> Also, I'm curious what kind of work we are talking about, which tech stack?
[14:22:54] <reneeontheweb> anyway on the whole support thing, i feel like doing product support is some of the best onboarding you can get, i've picked up so much about how folks actually use the stuff we build since i started doing shadowing sessions with the support folks
[14:23:57] <c355E3B> I am a big fan of forcing folks to shadow.
[14:24:25] <c355E3B> Also, I feel like I can do one better. We are in a position to dogfood our own stuff which is amazing (and terrible).
[14:25:44] <reneeontheweb> vladimyr: private equity portfolio monitoring software with a dash of analytics, with a python/typescript/react stack, stuff like custom report builders, automated data collection, data with full audit trail, etc
[14:30:56] <vladimyr> +1 on shadowing, no matter is it dev or product stuff. That is a very valuable experience!
[14:32:34] <vladimyr> reneeontheweb: usual stuff I'd say, sounds interesting combined with what you've said earlier about the team
[14:33:53] <reneeontheweb> yeah it's fun, we're like 12 devs, so you get a lot of work diversity

[15:18:48] <rb> vladimyr: problem is when stupidity beats fear
[15:19:16] <iDrougge> Luckily my workplace has a union agreement, so we are guaranteed a 1,8 % raise.
[15:19:21] <rb> i.e. a company fires their only dev after said dev demands a raise to compensate for inflatino

[16:31:40] <riv> I suppose every linux distro has its own thing which you could probably make use of

[16:36:33] <vladimyr> Which language/runtime we are talking about?

[16:39:40] <riv> I guess nix does it builds already in its own container system actually - so that means you dont even need to deal with docker
[16:40:31] <vladimyr> Hm, maybe, but you'd still want to for distribution

[19:18:26] <iDrougge>  <gwozniak> I have lowly DSL at home
[19:18:40] <iDrougge> I read that as "domain specific language". Wouldn't surprise me.

[19:20:03] <gwozniak> Lisp macros hanging all over the walls...
[19:20:50] <gwozniak> I tinkered with datalog for the first time in a while yesterday.  Kinda sad it wasn't appropriate for my problem
[19:23:10] <reneeontheweb> datalog seems sweet conceptually, but i feel like the inertia between implementations that exist, the effort to integrate a datalog runtime/program always outweighs the effort to just write it in whatever the main language would be

[19:23:31] <riv> what is the key thing about datalog that prolog doesn't have?
[19:23:43] <riv> I'm guessing it's something like, all queries terminate?
[19:23:57] <gwozniak> Yeah
[19:24:01] <gwozniak> That's really the key thing
[19:24:10] <riv> how does it compare to SQL?
[19:24:15] <riv> can you do everything sql can do?
[19:24:25] <reneeontheweb> kinda depends on your SQL dialect?
[19:24:57] <gwozniak> Pretty sure it can't do everything SQL can do, assuming SQL is turing complete
[19:25:10] <reneeontheweb> but afaik, pretty much yes, including CTEs
[19:25:11] <kline> some variants of sql are
[19:25:20] <c355E3B> Datalog can do everything that SQL can and vice versa.
[19:25:22] <kline> yeah, cte is the key in most
[19:25:39] <c355E3B> Datalog is much easier implement from a parsing perspective though.
[19:27:10] <gwozniak> Is arithmetic a common thing in Datalog implementations?  The one I was using didn't seem to support it, save for equality checking of atoms/constants
[19:27:43] <gwozniak> I can see inequalities being a problem
[19:28:22] <riv> in prolog arithmetic used to be a really awful thing
[19:28:41] <riv> but constraint solvers were added so you can do fun things like  3 + X #= 5 to get X #= 2
[19:29:01] <riv> I think in a datalog situation, you would probably still want arithmetic constraint solvers?
[19:29:42] <gwozniak> Yeah, but I could see that being a serious problem for termination of the computation
[19:30:42] <riv> It should not affect termination
[19:30:59] <kline> just write a program that looks at another program and does static analysis to see if it terminates
[19:31:00] <riv> every time an arithmetic constraint it processed, it does a finite computation and moves on
[19:31:11] <kline> then run this on your datalog stuff
[19:31:13] <kline> ezpz

[19:36:49] <kline> tragnos, memes aside, if you are only just finding this now, you might want to look at when these errors started. if they only start appearing in your logs recently (because you only updated to the patched version recently), youre probably going to want to start looking for signs of exploit
