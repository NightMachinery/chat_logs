[02:10:28] <kuudes> gwern, it has held so far and flu seems to have similar
[02:11:05] <kuudes> the general rationale is that for your body to mount counterattack with force X takes time Y. with 1000x more viral thingy your body has exponentially more stuff by time Y
[02:11:12] <mjr> My earlier Random IRC guy: "The new variant is definitely going to have much better immune evasion than everything else so far, but because the mutations are in the RBD it will also be proportionally much less effective at doing bad stuff. 
[02:11:15] <kuudes> so you win it later
[02:11:16] <mjr> But those proportion-of-sequences graphs are heavily misleading because they're scale-free. Guess what's the first thing you do when you see a new variant - you sequence the fuck out of all nearby samples to estimate its spread. The missing data point is that delta is pretty much gone in south africa at the moment. So anything that is currently spreading at all will massively outcompete it.
[02:11:22] <mjr> It's not really vaccine evasion because vaccination rate in SA is very low as is - the spread reduction of delta was done by public health measures rather than immunity. I fully expect this variant to have excellent vaccine evasion, but the nice thing is that mutations that make it more different also make it bind less tightly. The opposite is the case with delta - it had mutations that made it bind 
[02:11:26] <adiabatic> kuudes: do you happen to know anything if sauna temperatures (≥80°C) kill 'rona extra fast
[02:11:28] <mjr> better, and therefore more dangerous ...
[02:11:29] <mjr> This sounds as believable as random twitter guy who assumes tracking.
[02:11:31] <mjr> ... than previous variants"
[02:11:49] <kuudes> adiabatic, no. but I haven't heard much spread events in such.
[02:12:22] <adiabatic> good. I'm up to 21 minutes at 190° and I want to push to 22 the next time I'm in
[02:12:55] <mjr> AFAIK sauna kills 'rona pretty fast but I wouldn't assume not to get infected if sitting with someone shedding the virus
[02:12:59] <kuudes> I hope it is so. some have quoted an doctor saying it is mild, some have quoted the same doctor and same cases as that they are bad

[02:16:42] <kuudes> mjr, I guess if this is just a storm in a glass I am extremely relieved
[02:16:45] <PlanckWalk> Transmissibility proportional to mortality is a ridiculously unjustified assumption.
[02:16:51] <kuudes> I just don't understand why people believe it to be so
[02:17:31] <adiabatic> I hope I don't have to adjust anything. 
[02:17:40] <PlanckWalk> I mean sure, it *might* be, as one single point in a broad continuum.
[02:17:42] <adiabatic> My main would-get-the-rona vector is the gym.
[02:17:44] <kuudes> and I don't understand why people seem so focused to downplay it
[02:17:54] <kuudes> I mean, wouldn't it be more beneficial to overprep than underprep?
[02:18:12] <kuudes> adiabatic, this likely would spread just when you walk downtown, outdoors
[02:18:20] <mjr> at this time I'm not sure what _personally_ would be proper prepping. Buying toilet paper?
[02:18:21] <adiabatic> what's a "downtown"?
[02:18:46] <adiabatic> sorry, I'm a dyed-in-the-wool suburbanite
[02:18:57] <kuudes> mjr, do you have three doses? are your kids vaccinated? can you make 2020 spring like isolation for 2 months?
[02:19:02] <adiabatic> the only other time I'm out of the house I'm doing grocery shopping with an N95
[02:19:15] <mjr> I'm already penciled in for booster shot on Jan 23rd assuming they okay it for my group.
[02:19:15] <kuudes> yeah, that might still infect you with omicron, unsure
[02:19:37] <kuudes> yes, but by then this will have ridden over finland, if it is so
[02:20:04] <kuudes> on naked population R~20 would take over 5,5M people in some 5-6 weeks
[02:20:08] <mjr> kid's vaccinated, can isolate reasonably well, and yes I ffp2-shop anyway.
[02:20:14] <kuudes> oh, nice
[02:20:23] <kuudes> i have only managed to get one kid vaccinated
[02:20:33] <mjr> yeah luckily ours is 12
[02:20:37] <kuudes> nice
[02:21:05] <mjr> optimal age, has the lowest and therefore least base-risky age that can still vaccinate!
[02:21:07] <kuudes> I tried mine with a prescription but they forbade it. got to talk with the chief infection doctor on phone about it
[02:21:11] <PlanckWalk> It always drags on longer than raw R_0 values would suggest
[02:21:16] <kuudes> yes
[02:21:25] <kuudes> I presume at least 3 months
[02:21:29] <kuudes> likely longer here
[02:21:32] <PlanckWalk> Minimum, yes
[02:21:55] <kuudes> how long would you deem measles to take on a country with 70% vaccination rate?
[02:22:04] <kuudes> with worse vaccine than current measles vaccine
[02:22:10] <PlanckWalk> The faster it surges the more measures get put in place to limit spread
[02:22:31] <kuudes> yes. which is why I expect we will have a curfew by christmas
[02:22:41] <PlanckWalk> Yeah, seems likely
[02:23:00] <kuudes> and indeed 2% of population on the line, not counting icu overflow, which is multiple of that

[02:25:41] <kuudes> but yes. I am open to what should a person do with this information
[02:26:00] <kuudes> so far I have bought us masks and increased home delivery horizon; we took kid off from daycare already
[02:26:23] <kuudes> I guess now that the rest of the family is threedosed but the youngest, we might be ok
[02:26:36] <mjr> probably
[02:26:47] <kuudes> my nephew is not; my youngest has 1 dose

[02:27:28] <mjr> Or shall I just assume "fraud and/or theft"
[02:28:44] <kuudes> but yeah. indeed panicking is usually downplayed as counteruseful; but indeed in spring 2020 prepping in february was useful.
[02:28:58] <kuudes> so. now we are about back in february 2020. what should we do?
[02:30:11] <quanticle> Buy masks and toilet paper
[02:30:34] <kuudes> first done; I guess second increased gradually

[02:39:12] <Robomot> The History of Command Palettes: How Typing Commands Became The Norm Again | Capiche (The most popular new interface element in business software lets you tell apps exactly what you want to do.)
[02:43:44] <quanticle> I saw that article on HN, and I was surprised, because... command palettes are most definitely not the norm
[02:44:25] <quanticle> And I see no progress towards them becoming a norm since Sublime Text introduced the concept to the mainstream almost a decade ago
[02:47:26] <quanticle> Outside of Visual Studio code and emacs (M-x is totally a command palette if you have Helm or Ivy) I don't think I've used any of the examples he cites.
[02:47:42] <quanticle> Heck, I didn't even know about the MS Office one until he pointed it out
[02:50:49] <phill> mjr: that guy kinda has the right info but wrong conclusions lol
[02:51:04] <quanticle> But yeah, I'm ambivalent about command palettes. It's like a terminal prompt with autocomplete. I guess there's some value in that, but I'm not sure its any better than menus
[02:51:09] <quanticle> Menus and keyboard shortcuts
[02:52:04] <Obormot\Arcturus> Why not both
[02:52:20] <Obormot\Arcturus> Menus, keyboard shortcuts, and command palettes
[02:52:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> And toolbar buttons
[02:52:30] <quanticle> Sure
[02:52:38] <Obormot\Arcturus> And macros to turn any of those things into other things
[02:52:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> And a recordable-action macro system like ClarisWorks had

[02:56:37] <quanticle> You just say that because AutoCAD's UI was lisp
[02:56:47] <quanticle> Specifically: AutoLisp
[02:57:18] <saturn2> nope
[02:57:25] <quanticle> And I say *was* deliberately. I don't think AutoCAD ships AutoLisp any more.
[02:58:39] <saturn2> yes, they changed it to make it shittier because of course they did
[03:00:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> I am not familiar with the (old?) AutoCAD UI
[03:00:40] <Obormot\Arcturus> The only CAD software I've used was CADKey
[03:00:49] <Obormot\Arcturus> Which actually also had a very good UI
[03:00:54] <quanticle> Okay, here's a challenge for Obormot and/or saturn2: name one computer software UI that's gotten *better* over the past... let's say 15 years. That takes us back to 2006. Which program, today, has a better UI than it did in 2006?
[03:01:04] <Obormot\Arcturus> Uhh, hm
[03:01:16] <Obormot\Arcturus> That's a tough one for sure
[03:02:19] <PlanckWalk> GIMP.  It's still awful, but it was massively more awful back then? :-p
[03:02:24] <quanticle> lol
[03:02:27] <quanticle> Good question
[03:02:37] <quanticle> I have no memories of the GIMP UI from 2006
[03:02:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> GIMP is way too shitty for me to use
[03:03:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> Man, I really don't know. Gotten better? I think ... nothing??
[03:03:21] <PlanckWalk> I think Blender is better than it used to be
[03:03:25] <saturn2> it's like a hybrid command line and wimp gui that has all the advantages of both - if you click a menu command the equivalent text command shows up in your command history, if you start typing a command little gui widgets will pop up to show you what arguments there are and help you choose one
[03:03:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> PlanckWalk: Oh I've heard that, actually, yeah
[03:03:42] <PlanckWalk> But both of those are starting from a horribly low starting point.
[03:03:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> I don't use Blender myself but I have heard credible sources say they've improved the UI a lot
[03:03:57] <quanticle> Yeah, it has to have gotten *better*. If I allowed you to cite UIs that have stayed the same, it'd be too easy: shells, vim, emacs, all of these are essentially the same UI that they were in 2006.
[03:04:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: Wow that sounds awesome
[03:04:53] <PlanckWalk> Firefox has definitely worsened a great deal.
[03:05:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> quanticle: Yeah I dunno. Honestly can't think of any.
[03:05:37] <quanticle> Yeah, this is an unexpectedly difficult challenge
[03:05:48] <PlanckWalk> It should be an easy challenge :-(
[03:06:18] <quanticle> VLC? I guess? Actually no, VLC's UI has stayed the same. It's just a media player and it was just a media player in 2006.
[03:06:34] <Obormot\Arcturus> No, VLC got worse with 2.0
[03:06:40] <Obormot\Arcturus> That's why I still use 1.whatever the last one was
[03:06:43] <quanticle> Oh, you're right
[03:06:56] <quanticle> The settings UI got worse
[03:07:41] <Betawolf> vim's got better around the edges since '06
[03:09:06] <quanticle> Let's see. What about Windows? 2006 was still the era of Windows XP... and as bad as the Windows XP UI was, I can't really claim that Windows 10 is a substantial improvement. Seems like Windows got way worse with Vista (though arguably necessary to force application developers away from their assumption that the user is root on a Windows box), got better with 7, got dramatically worse again with
[03:09:08] <quanticle> 8, got better again with 10, and now... Windows 11 is worse again
[03:09:52] <quanticle> IIRC Vista came out in around 2007-ish?
[03:10:22] <quanticle> Yep, General Availability on January 30, 2007
[03:10:48] <quanticle> So we can't even use Windows Vista to artificially lower the baseline
[03:11:14] <saturn2> hmm in 2006 i think they still had those ATMs with buttons along the sides, the touchscreens are a slight improvement
[03:11:22] <PlanckWalk> I'm not even going to start to try claiming that Ubuntu got any better.
[03:11:26] <saturn2> that's literally the only thing i can think of
[03:11:51] <PlanckWalk> The ATMs here have both the buttons on the side and touchscreen, so yeah that's an improvement.
[03:12:03] <PlanckWalk> As in you can choose to use either.
[03:12:27] <quanticle> Yeah, fair enough. I use the buttons quite a lot still because fuck taking off your gloves in winter
[03:12:33] <quanticle> Ain't no one got time for that
[03:13:01] <PlanckWalk> s/time/enough fingers to lose to frostbite/ ?
[03:14:11] <saturn2> you'd have to be ridiculously slow to get frostbite in the time it takes to use an atm
[03:14:20] <PlanckWalk> Well yes :-)
[03:14:54] <quanticle> Yeah, the concern for me is that I take off the gloves, put them somewhere, use the ATM, take my money, take my card, and leave the gloves
[03:15:11] <quanticle> Later, "Why are my hands so cold?"
[03:16:19] <quanticle> Betawolf: How has vim's UI got better?
[03:16:57] <quanticle> I've seen the work they've done on enabling non-vimscript extensions (thanks to neovim), but I don't see how that really improves the vim UI, which, as far as I can tell, has been is stasis since the '80s.
[03:17:37] <gwern> quanticle needs those little mittens for children that clip onto your coat so you can't forget them
[03:17:52] <Betawolf> undo/redo improved since '06, and inbuilt terminals are handy sometimes
[03:18:33] <Betawolf> it's nothing huge, you can still vim like it's 1991, but there are a few more useful features

[03:54:04] <Obormot\Arcturus> How hard is it and how expensive are they on ebay or w/e?
[03:54:20] <Obormot\Arcturus> (The screens, I mean, not the calculators)
[04:03:56] <Obormot\Arcturus> Meanwhile, I just did a comparison of 13 different oatmeal cookie recipes from various sources (Betty Crocker, Food.com, Crisco shortening package, Silver Palate oatmeal package, the Dessert Bible, and Serious Eats). One thing that stands out is that the Serious Eats recipes are all dramatically higher in sugar content (as ratio of sugar to oats+flour) than the rest... a couple of the SE recipes have *double* the sugar
[04:03:56] <Obormot\Arcturus>  proportion as the sweetest recipes from any of the other sources!
[04:05:44] <Obormot\Arcturus> What's amazing is that if you read the comments on the Serious Eats recipes, people just don't bring up the sugar content at all. They have all sorts of other questions and complaints, but there's pretty much no one saying "this is ridiculously fucking sweet, are you guys out of your goddamn minds??"
[04:25:21] <quanticle> gwern: idk I might have worked there a while ago
[04:25:47] <quanticle> Obormot\Arcturus: I'm not even sure you can buy the screen separately from the calculator
[04:27:44] <gwern> quanticle: perhaps there are salvaged or removed ones for sale?
[04:28:02] <quanticle> Yeah, maybe. Time to check eBay
[04:29:08] <quanticle> Hahah, I searched for "Ti-83" "screen" on eBay and instead of getting screens for Ti-83s, I'm getting Ti-83s with broken screens
[04:29:33] <quanticle> No, eBay, you don't understand! The broken screen is the problem, and I'm looking for a solution
[04:30:43] <quanticle> Hmmm... given that you can buy an entire working calculator (with working screen) for ~$15, it might just be worth it to buy a calculator, strip the screen and dump the rest.

[04:32:16] <linear> dv^_^: have you enjoyed any uses of it? I usually end up not liking it nearly as much as allulose

[04:33:05] <quanticle> Obormot\Arcturus: Which Ti calculator are you looking for a replacement for?
[04:33:18] <dv^_^> Hopefully the nanny state approves it eventually
[04:33:32] <gwern> I bet you could buy ti screens in shenzhen ;_;
[04:34:21] <quanticle> Doubt it; does anyone other than Ti use a screen that primitive?
[04:34:59] <linear> dv^_^: i wonder how much work it would actually be to get it, as much as I know little of how the UK works wrt that it's hard to imagine it wouldn't be easy to find a website that would ship it to you. Although maybe this is illegal to a, like, notable extent and there could be consequences? no clue myself
[04:35:03] <quanticle> In Shenzen you could probably buy a drop-in replacement for the Ti screen that has like 8x the resolution is full color and is also backlit

[04:57:14] <gwern> now, I dunno what catern actually means, that's just what 'hot water' out of context means :)
[04:57:48] <gwern> (I wonder how many chinese know how weird 'drinking hot water' is?)
[04:57:51] <catern> gwern: interesting, good to know that there's probably tens of studies which suggest my practice of drinking hot water will prevent cancer and cure arthritis

[04:58:32] <quanticle> "Voltaire drank somewhere between 40 and 50 small cups of a chocolate-coffee mixture a day. Immanuel Kant, as an old man, would take coffee after dinner, and became desperate if his manservant delayed bringing it to the table. Søren Kierkegaard used to pour sugar into his cup until it reached above the brim, and then dissolve this white pyramid with incredibly strong black coffee. No wonder he
[04:58:34] <quanticle> was up all night writing. More recently, Derek Parfit, was so eager to continue his philosophical work, that he would fuel himself with instant coffee mixed with warm water from an ordinary tap rather than waste time boiling a kettle. He was busy, but not so busy that he could neglect his stimulant."
[04:58:38] <quanticle> What the fuck is wrong with all of these people?
[04:58:54] <quanticle> Oh wait, they're philosophers. No further explanation necessary
[04:59:29] <catern> but yes, regular hot water
[04:59:47] <quanticle> Now, I'm not one of those people who sneers at instant coffee... it's the "warm water from the tap" that confuses me
[05:00:02] <gwern> I think caffeine dissolves in it anyway
[05:00:18] <quanticle> Yeah, I have to wonder, at that point, just taking a No-Doz is going to be faster and cheaper, isn't it?

[05:02:24] <catern> you're welcome
[05:03:05] <quanticle> Yeah, but if he's dissolving it in warm tap water rather than boiling water, how much of the flavor is he getting? Anyway, this makes me think less of Parfit.

[07:04:57] <Robomot> Beto O'Rourke: 'Hell, yes, we're going to take your AR-15, your AK-47' | CNN Politics (Presidential candidate Beto O'Rourke reiterated his support for a mandatory gun-buyback program of assault-style rifles on Thursday and said, "Hell, yes, we're going to take your AR-15, your AK-47.")
[07:05:12] <gwern> I think in 20[12]x you really need to specify things like 'we all know what the worst possible X is' because I'm not sure we do

[07:05:44] <Robomot> Beto O'Rourke vows to outlaw automatic rifles if elected governor (During his failed run for the Democratic presidential nomination, Beto O'Rourke blamed Congress for not passing stricter gun-control measures.)
[07:06:08] <adiabatic> > “Look, we are a state that has a long, proud tradition of responsible gun ownership. And most of us here in Texas do not want to see our friends, our family members, our neighbors shot up with these weapons of war. So yes, I still hold this view,” O’Rourke said.
[07:06:37] <gwern> I wish he didn't say things like that. I'd've liked to quote his poem about licking cowballs when he became president

[07:29:16] <quanticle> adiabatic: Lol, when Beto announced that he was running for governor, even Reddit said, "Yeah, he has no chance and also announcing that you're going to take away people's guns is idiotic"
[07:29:25] <quanticle> When even Reddit has given up on you...
[07:30:03] <quanticle> Also, re: automatic rifles, does he mean *semi*automatic rifles?
[07:30:23] <quanticle> Because the manufacture of new automatic rifles has been banned since 1986
[07:30:59] <quanticle> (Yes, European viewers, up until 1986, you could purchase a brand new machine gun in the United States... entirely legally!)
[07:32:30] <adiabatic> I assume he doesn't know
[07:32:39] <adiabatic> and yes, he probably means semiautomatics too
[07:32:46] <quanticle> Didn't he serve in the military? Or am I getting him confused with Mayor Pete?
[07:33:17] <quanticle> I mean, I'd be okay with banning semi-automatic firearms
[07:33:43] <quanticle> Single action revolvers and bolt/lever action rifles, just like Colt and Winchester intended!
[07:34:17] <adiabatic> that just means criminals get semiautomatics
[07:34:22] <adiabatic> you ever tried reloading a revolver?
[07:34:42] <quanticle> Yeah, it's a pain, but not as much of a pain as loading a lever-action Winchester rifle
[07:34:44] <adiabatic> fastest way to do that is to stick it in a holster and pull out another revolver
[07:36:00] <quanticle> But I don't agree with the, "If we ban semi-autos, only criminals will have semi-autos" arguments. Yes, if you ban it in a stupid way, you'll end up with that. But look, right now machine guns are effectively banned, yes? But we don't see gangbangers rolling up with Ma Deuces and laying waste.
[07:36:44] <adiabatic> because machine guns are too expensive and not very useful
[07:36:53] <quanticle> Even Uzis
[07:36:54] <adiabatic> a semiautomatic is way more useful than a revolver
[07:36:57] <quanticle> And full-auto AKs
[07:36:59] <gwern> would they actually want to? I thought even when they could, machine guns were a gimmick. and it's not like the cartels in mexico outline their goons with machine guns as the default either
[07:37:05] <quanticle> You don't see people rolling up with those either
[07:37:12] <gwern> * like '20s style mobster
[07:37:24] <quanticle> gwern: They have full-auto AKs, though
[07:38:00] <quanticle> Which you don't see in the US, even though, in theory if we ban full-auto, only criminals will have full-auto
[07:39:49] <quanticle> If what adiabatic were saying were true, then why did the Las Vegas shooter resort to a hack like a bump stock, rather than just modifying his rifles to be full-auto? It's not that hard to mod an AR-15 to full auto, if you have access to the parts. 
[07:39:53] <quanticle> Limiting access works
[07:40:12] <adiabatic> the hack was probably easier to do/get support for
[07:40:25] <quanticle> And why is that?
[07:40:35] <quanticle> Could the fact that it's illegal have something to do with it?
[07:40:52] <adiabatic> Maybe!
[07:42:32] <quanticle> Right, so yes, maybe in a future world where we're all limited to non-self-loading firearms, people come up with hacks to modify their bolt-actions or single-action revolvers to be self-loading or double action. But those modifications will be less effective, and a lot less accessible than going to the store and just buying an AR-15.
[07:44:04] <quanticle> Also, when I said that machine guns were made illegal, I kind of lied. They're not *illegal*. You can still own a machine gun. You can still shoot a machine gun. But in order to have one, you need to have a special license, register it with the ATF, and file paperwork when you transfer it. I'm thinking we could do the same thing for semi-autos
[07:44:38] <adiabatic> that's "making it illegal"
[07:44:53] <quanticle> Is it? By that logic cars are illegal
[07:45:00] <adiabatic> in one of the cases where you'd need it most
[07:46:14] <quanticle> Which case is that? Overthrowing the government? I mean, you're not going to be overthrowing the government with semi-autos either. 
[07:46:51] <adiabatic> a bunch of goatherds in the hills got by pretty well with just AKs 
[07:47:02] <quanticle> Absolutely wrong
[07:47:16] <adiabatic> they're still there, we're not.
[07:47:20] <quanticle> A bunch of goatherds got along pretty well with AKs, RPG-7s, and IEDs
[07:47:25] <quanticle> It's the latter two that are important
[07:47:36] <gwern> no, you said *new* machine guns. I thought those were illegal and all the legal ones are pre-existing grandfathered in?
[07:47:37] <quanticle> And I don't see you arguing for legal grenade launchers
[07:47:46] <quanticle> gwern: Yeah, new machine guns are illegal
[07:47:57] <quanticle> But not machine guns in general
[07:48:07] <quanticle> If you have one from before the registry closed you can keep it
[07:48:10] <adiabatic> quanticle: remember, one man's modus ponens is another man's modus tollens
[07:48:34] <gwern> and as you point out, the flow of new machine guns does indeed seem to be pretty thoroughly choked off. the ever escalating price of old machine guns indicates no new supply is trickling in like we see with 'old' ivory
[07:51:05] <quanticle> IIRC the US started forcing registration of machine guns in the '60s and closed the registry in the '86. So roughly 20 years. I'm envisioning a ban on semi-autos going the same way. Start forcing registration now, then close the registry in 2040 or 2050. It'll take much longer for semi-autos to fade out, because there are oh so many more of them, but if you know where they all are and you know
[07:51:07] <quanticle> who has them, they're less dangerous.
[07:52:38] <quanticle> adiabatic: I guess what I'm trying to point out is that semi-auto is a really weird stopping point. Basically unrestricted? Fine. Single-shot? Fine. No firearms at all? Fine. But firearms that self-load, but don't fire more than one round is not, I don't think, a long-term stable Schelling point.
[07:53:01] <adiabatic> well, yeah. all slopes are slippery.
[07:53:31] <quanticle> I actually wouldn't mind if they reopened the NFA registry :)
[07:53:43] <quanticle> I could get me a MAC-10!
[07:54:05] <adiabatic> IIRC that's vaguely uzi-like
[07:54:08] <adiabatic> spray-and-pray
[07:54:15] <quanticle> (Pro-tip: don't buy a MAC-10; it's a shitty gun, whose only claim to fame is that Vincent Vega got shot with it in Pulp Fiction)
[07:57:08] <quanticle> But yeah, my take is that we should either ban (in the same way that we've banned full-auto) semi-auto OR that we should reopen the NFA registry and allow quanticle to buy that PPSh
[08:02:32] <quanticle> Maaaan, I'm probably going to have to start lifting
[08:03:29] <adiabatic> you should start lifting anyway
[08:04:27] <quanticle> Yeah, the realization is due to the fact that 1) I'm getting old and 2) I spoke with my mom and it turns out that some absurd number of my older relatives have osteoporosis and like random connective tissue issues
[08:04:44] <quanticle> And lifting encourages bone density in a way that running doesn't
[08:04:45] <adiabatic> do you eat collagen and things with collagen in it
[08:04:50] <quanticle> No, but I should
[08:04:55] <quanticle> That's also a good idea
[08:05:15] <adiabatic> my mother gets old-lady spots when she lays off the collagen
[08:05:23] <adiabatic> when she returns to sprinkling it on her food they go away
[08:05:34] <quanticle> Huh, okay
[08:06:11] <adiabatic> I dump 48g collagen powder in 4 lb of ground beef for kabobs
[08:06:29] <adiabatic> that lasts me usually a little less than a week
[08:17:40] <quanticle> gwern: I'm reading this article on Japanese cat folklore that you linked earlier and...
[08:17:43] <quanticle> "Not all bakeneko were lethal, however. Around 1781, rumors began to spread that some of the courtesans of the walled pleasure districts in the capital city of Edo were not human at all, but rather transformed bakeneko. The idea that passing through the doors of the Yoshiwara meant a dalliance with the supernatural held a delicious thrill to it. Eventually, these stories expanded beyond the
[08:17:45] <quanticle> courtesans to encompass an entire hidden cat world, including kabuki actors, artists, comedians, and other demimonde. When these cats left their homes at night, they donned kimonos, pulled out sake and shamisen, and basically held wild parties before slinking back home at dawn."
[08:18:09] <quanticle> So uh... the idea of catgirls goes *way* back huh
[08:18:43] <quanticle> "These stories proved irresistible to artists, who produced illustrations featuring a wild world of cats dancing and drinking late into the evening hours. The cats were depicted as anthropomorphic human-cat hybrids (although the bakeneko were capable of shapeshifting into fully human forms, too)."
[08:18:48] <quanticle> rufkm
[08:20:10] <quanticle> "A shamisen maker who got too greedy might be cursed with a neko musume daughter as revenge. Instead of a beloved human daughter, they would find themselves with a cat in human form who was incapable of human speech, ate rats, and scratched their claws."
[08:20:13] <quanticle> So... autism?

[11:07:30] <feep[work]> I was thinking about the frame control post some more
[11:07:43] <feep[work]> and I think the core of this is understanding why autists like the *setting* of touhou.
[11:08:10] <feep[work]> and I think it's, in a large part, because it's social punch buggy.
[11:08:39] <feep[work]> like, if you think about the framing of touhou, you'd think they'd hate it because people fight each other all the time, right? and for really stupid reasons, too?
[11:08:39] <quanticle> Frame control?

[11:09:22] <feep[work]> but I think the core is: first, that people fight each other for *overtly* stupid reasons. like, really, incredibly, unbelievably stupid reasons. it's an acknowledged and highlighted part of the concept.
[11:09:31] <feep[work]> people break out weapons of fucking mass destruction at the drop of a hat.
[11:09:53] <feep[work]> I'm not aware of anyone in touhou who I'd say fights others for like ... anything approaching moral righteousness.
[11:10:19] <feep[work]> but the second part is, like, yeah people get eaten by yokai or whatever, that's just the price of living, whatever
[11:10:53] <quanticle> Jesus, feep, this is the longest reddit post I've seen outside /r/askhistorians
[11:11:08] <feep[work]> but as far as I'm aware with limited exposure, effectively nobody gets like ... meaningfully *destroyed*. it's not a story about annihilating enemies. people will fight, and people will show up in some story five months later having fucking ogiri together or whatever.
[11:11:41] <feep[work]> the massive showy danmaku fights in touhou are just a normal part of social interactions, and you can move past them, you can *move past being defeated* and still keep living in basically the same society.
[11:12:54] <feep[work]> the closest thing outside of it would be nanoha's way of defeating enemies by beating them up a lot, and I think even then there's the occasional unrepentant evil person that just gets fucked. like... any story with that, any autist, will read not as "good will triumph" but as "I will be that evil person getting annihilated by a giant laser."
[11:13:07] <feep[work]> and that's imo the core story beat that as far as I can tell, just does not exist in touhou.
[11:13:21] <quanticle> Hmmm... if it makes you feel any better, what you said applies to actual wars between nations. One of the things I push back against is the notion that World War 2 was a "normal" war. World War 2 was not a normal war! Normal wars, even wars between Great Powers, are usually not fought to annihilation. 
[11:13:40] <feep[work]> yeah normal wars are not total wars
[11:15:09] <feep[work]> quanticle: the core to me is something I only got to in addendum five, the three axioms of online autism: "everything is a social battle, you will lose every social battle, if you lose a social battle you lose everything."
[11:15:11] <quanticle> And one of the things that really worries me about the US is that, even though we're a great power, we have no idea how to fight a normal war
[11:15:38] <feep[work]> and I think that's really the heart of my feelings about this.
[11:15:49] <quanticle> Our template for war is World War 2 and the Cold War, both of which resulted in the utter annihilation of our enemies.
[11:15:56] <feep[work]> any social system that wants me to buy into it has to *directly refute* these three axioms.
[11:16:31] <feep[work]> and touhou actually refutes all three!
[11:17:10] <feep[work]> ie. everything is a danmaku battle, danmaku battles are down to individual power but also skill, and if you lose a danmaku battle you lose your immediate goal but not your place in society.

[11:45:47] <feep[work]> the second trick here is that a thing in an orbit catches up to another thing in the same orbit if it has *less* energy. this is a bit counterintuitive. try it out in kerbal etc
[11:46:27] <feep[work]> so as the lower moon gets closer to the higher moon, it *gains* energy from its gravitational attraction and that gives it a higher orbit and makes it fall behind again. somehow, I don't know how, probably astronomers know, this has ended up in a stable oscillatory system.

[11:47:56] <shawwwn> but I'm also with feep
[11:48:52] <feep[work]> they do basically bounce off each other. except, like, because it's orbits, they anti-bounce.
[11:49:08] <feep[work]> they bounce by being too attracted.

[11:51:00] <shawwwn> but I think I get it now
[11:51:07] <shawwwn> ty quanticle feep
[11:51:19] <feep[work]> I think it works out like, when they come close enough they basically do a flyby off each other, and this gives it an energy transfer that ends up in an oscillation where they go the "other way" again. but note that they're still actually going the same way in their orbit
[11:51:30] <feep[work]> just the one that was a bit higher is now a bit lower and counterwise.
[11:52:19] <feep[work]> it just happens that in an orbit, you *can* make something fly away by attracting it.
[11:52:55] <nshepperd> it's a mad max car chase but they're in orbit
[11:53:02] <feep[work]> if you have the ksp map view in mind, visualize the upper moon pulling on the lower moon and that raises its orbital radius.
[11:54:32] <feep[work]> like, from that perspective it's not hard to see how this could happen once. what boggles me is imagining it happening millions of times. some part of me goes "come on, that *can't* be stable, can it?"

[12:58:53] <Khoth> I'm glad my snap judgement many years ago turned out to be right
[12:59:02] <feep[work]> I mean, you could just have not paid attention at all
[12:59:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> Also, lol wtf @ this Aella post. Does she ever get around to saying anything concrete at all
[12:59:41] <Khoth> idk I just started mashing page down
[12:59:43] <feep[work]> Obormot\Arcturus: I think she's trying to be careful because she did See The Skulls of introducing a new social superweapon into the memeplex
[12:59:59] <Obormot\Arcturus> siiigh
[13:00:01] <feep[work]> she's just trying to be reflexively careful in the way of a person who's never had it happen to them.
[13:00:19] <Obormot\Arcturus> What do you mean
[13:00:22] <rsaarelm> I thought Leverage conclusively established that Geoff has unique understanding into the mechanics of human society and further pursuit of comprehension is futile unless it is done under Geoff's supervision, as verified by a thorough peer review by Leverage.
[13:00:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> As in, she's never had it happen to her? What is "it"
[13:00:33] <feep[work]> like, a lot of the article is the "yeah but" kind of hedging, right?
[13:00:49] <Obormot\Arcturus> Who never had what happen to them? I'm just having trouble parsing that sentence
[13:00:53] <feep[work]> like, the experience of having a totally normal academic concept abused and violently turned against you 
[13:01:08] <Obormot\Arcturus> Aella never had this happen to her, you're saying?
[13:01:21] <feep[work]> that's what it reads like! she's seen it happen, but I'm not sure if it's happened *to* her
[13:01:25] <feep[work]> if it does, that makes this even worse :v
[13:01:26] <Khoth> Anyway I hope that article doesn't get traction because if it does people will say "Frame control" a lot and I won't know what they're talking about because the post is too long
[13:01:28] <feep[work]> did*
[13:01:29] <Obormot\Arcturus> Ok I see
[13:01:40] <saturn2> leverage produced some articles about how the bicycle was invented or something like that
[13:02:00] <Obormot\Arcturus> Ah yes their very important research into the history of invention or some shit
[13:02:08] <Obormot\Arcturus> An obvious smokescreen!
[13:02:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> Who can't see this!
[13:02:13] <Khoth> Pandering to the bicycle history enthusiasts
[13:02:15] <dv^_^> what article?
[13:02:16] <feep[work]> Obormot\Arcturus: because like, a lot of the hedging is like "yeah this is totally normal and everyone does it, let me introduce 20 reasons why your neighbour is doing it to you right now and you might not even know"

[13:08:02] <feep[work]> okay ping me about it later
[13:08:07] <Obormot\Arcturus> ok
[13:08:08] <rsaarelm> Also, Howard's stories are pretty good.
[13:08:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yes
[13:08:34] <rsaarelm> Arnold-Conan was already something of a caricature from them, and then the Oglaf stuff is just nth order flanderization of that.
[13:08:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> The one I was reading was one I have archived on my wiki! Check it: https://wiki.obormot.net/Archive/BlackColossus
[13:08:36] <Robomot> Black Colossus — OborWiki
[13:08:57] <feep[work]> rsaarelm: okay yeah but oglaf's stuff is compelling as fuck
[13:09:09] <feep[work]> I unironically love grognak.
[13:09:26] <feep[work]> he's such an unrepentant chad.
[13:10:40] <rsaarelm> It feels like it's ended up on a different archetype that's all about social domination, because social stuff is where all the fun monkey stuff is going on.
[13:11:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> "At one point, while in a discussion about gender dynamics, the leader casually mentioned that “if Aella were a man, people would find her disgusting.” This was plausibly a normal thing to say in context; he was known for saying hard truths, for having insights about gender, and to be fair I _was_ sitting there sweaty, topless, and on acid, *and* I hadn’t showered in a week (this was at burning man). But it also had the
[13:11:27] <Obormot\Arcturus>  function of _reframing respect for me as actually coming from attraction_; with this sentence, it caused everybody listening to reevaluate their opinions about me, to doubt their own experience of liking what I had to say." ... hahaha
[13:11:29] <Obormot\Arcturus> Ahahahaha.
[13:11:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> "oh no frame control it's so evil oh no" ... ahaha
[13:11:50] <rsaarelm> Original Conan has the chad thing going, but he's even more about being clever about not being killed by impersonal nature when he's stuck on a glacier or on a deserted island with a demon running around or something.
[13:12:01] <feep[work]> rsaarelm: right but grognak is *not* about social domination, that's the compelling thing about him, his whole tribe operates on social validation of honor while he's the only one running on internal honor. he's very worflike, or rorschachlike.
[13:12:29] <Obormot\Arcturus> Some nasty mean man once said a thing that embarrassed poor Aella by pointing out that a whole lotta guys only give a shit about her because she's hot and THIS CANNOT STAND
[13:12:56] <feep[work]> I mean, it's a valid point, the effect was what she noticed.
[13:13:10] <Obormot\Arcturus> An ENTIRE THEORY OF SOCIAL INTERACTION must be invented to PROVE that this evil mean man was EVIL
[13:13:11] <feep[work]> whether the effect was valid is.. almost not relevant.
[13:13:23] <Obormot\Arcturus> feep[work]: Oh, it's relevant
[13:13:31] <feep[work]> at least the notion of valid harms is not even considered in this model.
[13:13:41] <feep[work]> I think this actually cuts to my core objection with it vis a vis primacy of harms.
[13:14:14] * shawwwn briefly thought the conversation was about valid harems, which raises the question of what an invalid harem would be
[13:14:15] <feep[work]> Obormot\Arcturus: I mean, the theory of social interaction is still totally valid
[13:14:33] <feep[work]> much as it is repeatedly invented through the ages, cough reality tunnels cough two movies cough
[13:14:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> "The examples I’m giving are obvious, salient ones, because they stood out and I remembered them." Oh gosh I WONDER WHY
[13:14:59] <Obormot\Arcturus> *two examples* *one of them is about how she personally was dissed one time* hmmmmmm
[13:15:00] <feep[work]> shawwwn: harem of size 0, presumably
[13:15:33] <feep[work]> is that the most or the least degenerate harem...
[13:15:34] <shawwwn> that would be a degenerate harem, wouldn't it? aka #lw-fandom
[13:15:37] <saturn2> i think aella is kind of disgusting even as a woman
[13:15:39] <shawwwn> lol
[13:17:05] <shawwwn> but how
[13:17:13] <feep[work]> Obormot\Arcturus: to be fair, I think this post stems from aella herself experiencing the "three laws of being an inexperienced autist"
[13:17:25] <Obormot\Arcturus> She's attractive, there's no reason to deny that (though admittedly maybe I'd feel differently if I saw her on acid not having showered for a week etc., that does sound kind of ew) ... and certainly doing huge amounts of hallucinogenic drugs isn't the most appealing quality in a person of any sex
[13:17:31] <feep[work]> (everything is social battle, you will lose, you will lose things that you didn't know you could lose)
[13:17:41] * shawwwn goes back and forth about asking what saturn2 considers a beautiful woman
[13:17:42] <Obormot\Arcturus> feep[work]: Hah, I like that
[13:18:25] <shawwwn> the only explanation is that you're not into women. which I can get behind (﻿ ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) but is sort of beside the point
[13:18:51] <Obormot\Arcturus> "If this happens in a culture of intense self-improvement, where people are used to finding actual insights by investigating their own resistance to things, this can be a very effective tactic, because it’s a question that points to a legitimately useful direction—there is _always_ something interesting going on in your own experience." ... but what if... this is just another piece of evidence that such cultures are
[13:18:51] <Obormot\Arcturus>  actually bad??
[13:19:26] <feep[work]> I think it's fair to ask whether cultures of self-improvement actually generate self-improvement
[13:19:27] <shawwwn> by any metric, aella is pretty
[13:19:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> Focusing too much on "self-improvement" is actually a bad idea and predictably goes wrong in many ways, some of them quite desctructive (and self-destructive)!
[13:19:49] <feep[work]> but I think it's also reasonable to say that a culture of self-improvement that causes self-improvement in 60% and harms 40% of participants may still be worth the attempt
[13:20:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> feep[work]: It is fair to ask that, yes, but insufficient, because the answer is "no" and the follow-up question is "but is that the only problem with them", and the answer to that one is also "no".
[13:20:35] <feep[work]> well, it might not be no if you expect your current capability level to be inadequate to your goals
[13:20:41] <rsaarelm> "Self-improvement" always has the implied "towards what end" question attached, so self-improvement as an end in itself sounds like it might pretty easily degenerate.
[13:20:49] <feep[work]> so like, what, you'll become even more inadequate? meh?? you might kill yourself? you were planning that anyway
[13:20:50] <shawwwn> actually never mind, saturn2 was right https://twitter.com/Aella_Girl/status/1411580619453206528
[13:20:53] <Obormot\Arcturus> feep[work]: It's especially extra double no in that case.
[13:20:58] <feep[work]> like, I can see a frame where you would be right to walk into that
[13:21:16] <rsaarelm> Same problem as "happiness for happiness' sake", mistaking the gauge for the thing being measured.
[13:21:31] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yes.
[13:21:44] <Obormot\Arcturus> If you're in a "culture of intense self-improvement" you've already failed
[13:21:45] <feep[work]> that makes sense and I agree it's a primary failure mode.
[13:22:07] <Obormot\Arcturus> You should instead be in a "culture of doing actually useful shit instead of focusing on yourself so damn much"
[13:22:07] <feep[work]> but like ... it feels like taking the skill in fallout 4 that just gives you more xp, right?
[13:22:20] <feep[work]> like, if you only grind and dump all your points into that one skill, you're a dumbass, but it's still not a bad skill
[13:22:50] <feep[work]> also the sequences have a post about this, because of course they do (two cult koans)
[13:22:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's like gwern's thing about QS
[13:22:58] <shawwwn> huh. Good points https://twitter.com/Aella_Girl/status/1396517943320580096

[13:23:39] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's actually harmful because it's *at best* a timesink and at worse, yes, goodharting, optimizing away useful but hard to measure stuff, etc., etc.
[13:23:46] <feep[work]> as blindsight says:

[13:24:27] <feep[work]> (quote minimally adjusted)

[13:25:45] <feep[work]> ever*
[13:27:33] <Obormot\Arcturus> "The problem is if your goal is to end your suffering, and the actual best way to end your suffering is to change your circumstances, then “investigate your own resistance” is a distraction; it’s a frame where _your circumstances are not considered as a changeable option_." ... yes, well, this is a special case of a general pattern, which is that a certain sort of person is way too eager to buy into the whole "introspect
[13:27:33] <Obormot\Arcturus>  your way to success" bullshit
[13:27:52] <Obormot\Arcturus> In fact the default should almost always be to do something out in, and with, and to, the world
[13:30:05] * Obormot\Arcturus is once again reminded of the ending of "The Final Circle of Paradise"
[13:31:42] <feep[work]> I mean it sounds like you're saying "yes people are vulnerable to this pattern"
[13:31:50] <feep[work]> but more scoffing :p
[13:32:23] <Obormot\Arcturus> feep[work]: No, I'm saying that this needs to be *recognized* as an instance of the pattern, which has been polemicized against *at length*

[13:32:40] <feep[work]> fair enough
[13:32:50] <feep[work]> I mean, it is a widespread metapattern
[13:33:04] <feep[work]> like, to find love, stop caring so extremely much about finding love
[13:33:22] <feep[work]> lots of things have the "when you stop searching, you will find" nature
[13:33:45] <feep[work]> it's quite unfair.
[13:33:54] *** Lord_of_Life_ is now known as Lord_of_Life
[13:33:54] <feep[work]> though amusingly similar to the orbits from earlier
[13:33:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> I don't think that's quite the same thing
[13:34:27] <feep[work]> well though it is, isn't it? the thing that's unattractive about explicitly looking for attraction is that it signals a kind of deliberative desperation
[13:34:51] <feep[work]> like, you're trying to grind perception of worth instead of worth
[13:35:01] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yeah I don't really think it's the same thing
[13:35:14] <feep[work]> I think this is unattractive *because* it's the metapattern.
[13:35:48] <feep[work]> we recognize it as a damaging attractor, hence the turnoff.
[13:36:10] <Obormot\Arcturus> Anyway, I increasingly get the sense that this Aella thing is yet another case of "person with mental issues sees faults in other people and the world but actually they just ("just") need to fix their shit, the stuff they're looking at is actually normal and fine, the problem is them"
[13:36:31] <feep[work]> I mean.... there is ..... like, yes, but...
[13:37:09] <feep[work]> I'm not sure that the world is healthy enough to be able to say that the onus is on the individual as the best point of improvement.
[13:37:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> Like, wow, girl, your childhood was clearly very fucked up, then you did All The Drugs and broke your brain further, you clearly have lots of shit going on, but that doesn't mean that normal people interacting in normal ways, that *you* can't deal with sensibly because you're super fucked up, are somehow doing anything wrong or at fault etc.
[13:37:52] <feep[work]> like, to some extent this is like the rape thing, uh
[13:38:08] <phill> I mean "frame control" is a pickup artist term
[13:38:19] <feep[work]> like, I remember this really offensive post about how some people are like, repeat victims because they attract rapists by their intense victimhood signalling
[13:38:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> There's lots of value in studying patterns of social interaction like some of the ones she describes, and in some cases we might want to stop doing such things, or modify our response to such things, etc. - this is all fine
[13:38:35] <phill> She used to be really active in the pickup artist irc channel, so it's no doubt she got it from there
[13:38:44] <feep[work]> I think to some extent it's not a coincidence that damaged people get lots of abusers.
[13:39:02] <feep[work]> and not just in the obvious way where abuse causes damage.
[13:39:16] <Obormot\Arcturus> But this business where we're supposed to panic and decide to label *yet another* part of everyday existence as An Evil Force For Evil ... sorry, no, it's just you
[13:39:30] <feep[work]> like, I think some people look at "lots of people bad at social come together to be an ingroup" as "oh hey a sheep buffet."

[13:40:33] <Obormot\Arcturus> dv^_^: Is there anything in this article that would make any sane person have any response other than "obviously not, next question"?
[13:40:50] <feep[work]> Obormot\Arcturus: I mean, I can relate to it, but define sane lol.
[13:41:17] <feep[work]> like, that seems kind of hard to answer affirmatively, I think the real question is if sane people exist at all and in what number.
[13:41:22] <Obormot\Arcturus> feep[work]: I define sane as me, insane as not-me. Obviously :p
[13:41:30] <feep[work]> I mean, yes, to be fair, I should have expected that :p
[13:42:10] <Obormot\Arcturus> And yes, sane people exist. We're mostly sane in this channel
[13:42:33] <Obormot\Arcturus> Most of my IRL friends are sane
[13:42:36] <feep[work]> well but like ... if the world is mostly insane, then this is back on the table, right?
[13:42:40] <Obormot\Arcturus> no
[13:42:43] <feep[work]> because then it's a matter of effective care.
[13:42:51] <Obormot\Arcturus> nah
[13:43:18] <feep[work]> like, maybe we do need 100 reinventions of social dynamics before everyone has good odds to find one and be able to refer to them when they need them
[13:44:10] <Obormot\Arcturus> There are bad ways of reinventing social dynamics and this is definitely one of them
[13:44:19] <feep[work]> I mean, sure
[13:44:29] <feep[work]> I think the concept of "framing" at all is the vital payload here.
[13:44:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> On the whole we need fewer reinventions of social dynamics, actually
[13:44:40] <feep[work]> getting people into the framing framing is good even if the strategy is bad and harmful.
[13:45:01] <feep[work]> I remember reading about language and framing in my children's math riddles book
[13:45:08] <feep[work]> that was good times <3 <3
[13:45:12] <feep[work]> word riddles*, rather
[13:45:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Good god, this post is still going)
[13:45:36] <saturn2> it seems like her post is doing the very thing it describes
[13:45:43] <feep[work]> saturn2: RIGHT!? THAT WAS MY FEELING TOO
[13:46:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> "They do not demonstrate vulnerability in conversation, or if they do it somehow processes as still invulnerable." ... HAAAAAH! Oh man
[13:46:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> This whole paragraph
[13:46:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> Imagine portraying this as *bad*
[13:46:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> My god
[13:46:43] <saturn2> she's describing emotional abuse then throwing in a few other things she doesn't like and packing them together as "frame control"
[13:46:53] <feep[work]> that was also my impression, yeah
[13:47:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> "long after the talk I realized at no point in the conversation he had indicated being impacted by my ideas, despite there being multiple opportunities for him to make at the very least small acknowledgements that I was onto something good" ... oh yeah? Maybe because your ideas were actually dumb and bad??
[13:47:27] <feep[work]> Obormot\Arcturus: to be fair, I *still* think this is valid

[13:48:56] <feep[work]> her view of how interaction should ought to go is normie social.

[13:51:37] <saturn2> it's not a measure of anything
[13:51:41] <feep[work]> it sorta is
[13:51:51] <feep[work]> like, it's a generic measure of formidableness, I think?
[13:52:09] <feep[work]> there's a general competence factor, and status tries to measure it
[13:52:38] <feep[work]> it's mostly not very good at this! which is why it seems like a treadmill! but it's nonzero correlated

[16:00:45] <Obormot\Arcturus> Bam
[16:00:55] <feep[work]> they're basically superhero incubators
[16:01:54] <feep[work]> any parahuman possesses a special structure in their brain called a corona pollentia, or "soul gem"...
[16:02:04] <Gurkenglas> never heard it called soul gem
[16:02:13] <feep[work]> Gurkenglas: it's a joke, I'm comparing the setup to madoka
[16:02:14] <Gurkenglas> probably a reference to some other work?
[16:04:16] <Gurkenglas> wait why do people have corona pollentiae in this setting anyway - does Warrior start by implanting everyone that he expects to trigger in order to make the later interfacing easier?
[16:04:22] <feep[work]> yes
[16:04:33] <feep[work]> well, the individual shards have like utility libraries for this
[16:05:45] <Gurkenglas> it would make sense if people had to grow up with it implanted, but i thought the first triggers were adult
[16:05:56] <Gurkenglas> ...or is it just that they are adult *now* ._.
[16:06:13] <nshepperd2> is it a genetic manipulation thing or do they just stick a noodly appendage into your brain from the fourth dimension when you're born and plonk it in there
[16:06:17] <feep[work]> I think that one
[16:06:39] <feep[work]> a lot of this setting runs on forecasting :v
[16:07:00] <Gurkenglas> i think the first one, because superpowers are sorta heritable and that would make sense if there's less work to do when your genes are already patched
[16:08:14] <feep[work]> all I remember it's that it's two-stage, and you can't really trigger unless you have the first stage
[16:08:20] <feep[work]> but I don't think it's genetic
[16:09:32] <Gurkenglas> do Thinker capes have a pollentia or does she just do it entirely differently?
[16:09:39] <feep[work]> same setup exactly
[16:09:45] <Gurkenglas> yeah, trumps wouldnt make sense otherwise
[16:09:49] <feep[work]> I think it's entity basecode
[16:10:01] <Gurkenglas> so then it must be noodly intervention
[16:10:06] <feep[work]> yes
[16:10:10] <feep[work]> also consider that dragon has a corona
[16:10:24] <feep[work]> in her case, it's like an i/o port.

[16:11:36] <feep[work]> and like, capes without brains exist.
[16:12:11] <Gurkenglas> presumably the brainless capes are merely hidden in another dimension. which is why Flechette still gets them.
[16:14:15] <Gurkenglas> I agree that Dragon must have an interface; you've also now convinced me that the interface setup must generalize beyond that with genes
[16:14:53] <Gurkenglas> i suppose the sorta-heritability must come from the lifelong proximity to capes.

[20:10:18] <PapuaHardyNet> each file in the Pile dataset is an zstd which contains jsonlines, which are text files where every line is a valid json line with at least one field called "text"

[22:30:04] <Robomot> Disclose.tv (@disclosetv): "Former CTO and new Twitter CEO Agrawal in November 2020 interview: "Our role is not to be bound by the First Amendment... focus[ing] less on thinking about free speech, but thinking about how the times have changed.""
[22:32:29] <spxtr> Well that's ominous.
[22:33:48] <ggreer> so I applied for an oregon concealed handgun license back in june. got an appointment in september. got a call today saying they sent the license but it got returned to sender because they don't do mail forwarding. now it'll probably be another 3 months before the send it to my new address
[22:34:36] <ggreer> these permits have to be renewed every 4 years. that's like 20% of the duration of the permit spent in bureaucratic hell
[22:35:45] <shawwwn> ggreer: look at the plus side. Now you don't need to defend yourself
[22:36:37] <gwern> how hard is the renewal?
[22:37:21] <ggreer> you mail in some paperwork and a check for ~$30. the problem is that you have no idea how long it'll take to get the new license
[22:37:36] <ggreer> everyone in portland is getting licenses so they're overwhelmed
[22:38:05] <spxtr> Why is everyone in portland getting their licenses?
[22:38:11] <ggreer> because crime is insane
[22:38:13] <gwern> hm. but the renewal echo in 4 years should be a lot more easy to handle than granting brandnew ones
[22:38:36] <ggreer> hopefully but it's not clear if they're increasing staffing to handle the surge of applications
[22:38:50] <ggreer> they're certainly not increasing staffing in things like... beat cops

[22:43:49] <kuudes> at least south africa already has too many doses, they say
[22:44:38] <adiabatic> who'd want to be a beat cop in Portland, though
[22:45:08] <ggreer> in 2019, 389 people were shot in portland. in 2020 it was 891. this year it's already at 1,080
[22:46:45] <gwern> so maybe 1180 total
[22:47:17] <ggreer> for comparison, so far this year 4,000 portlanders have been hospitalized with covid

[23:12:13] <feepbot> <gwern> '“Margins are still thin, even when things are good,” Cohen says. That’s because child care doesn’t work like a normal business. Looking after young children comes with a litany of regulations to ensure the programs are safe. There are square footage requirements, zoning restrictions, earthquake preparedness plans, fire safety codes, CPR certifications, nutritional
[23:12:13] <feepbot> guidelines, rules about parking and outdoor space, liability insurance. The priciest regulation is a child-to-staff ratio requiring one caregiver for every three or four infants, depending on the state. That’s a lot of employees, and it explains why quality care for one baby costs more than many families can afford. Cheaper options are often unlicensed and unregulated, and
[23:12:13] <feepbot> parents have no guarantee their kids are secure. Because babies are so expensive, a lot of businesses simply don’t accept them. Others charge less than it costs to look after them and load up on older children. According to child-care availability studies, almost 80% of spots are reserved for kids 3 years and older, because they’re subject to more lenient staffing requirements,
[23:12:18] <feepbot> making them cheaper to care for. Cohen accepts infants, charging just below $2,000 a month for babies younger than 2 and $1,500 for older kids. That doesn’t leave her much money to pay employees. Before Covid, Wow & Flutterville assistants started off at $15 an hour, barely above Portland’s minimum wage.'
