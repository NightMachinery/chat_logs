[06:46:59] <efex> I am looking at buying a new music computer.. kind of fun but man $$
[06:47:55] <sublim20> how does a music computer differ from a regular computer?
[06:48:42] <efex> It is optimised for disk access and GPU is not really important
[06:49:12] <efex> cpu, ssd speed but graphics whatever
[06:49:14] <louipc> murder me when im dead
[06:49:41] <piercedwater> i'd just setup a 4 disk array in an external enclosure with SSDs and be done with it
[06:49:59] <louipc> need an audio processing unit
[06:50:22] <louipc> for max audio performance
[06:50:34] <sublim20> im gonna murder you so hard, when you die
[06:51:12] <louipc> but i think a music computer would prioritize deterministic real-time operation
[06:51:15] <louipc> low latency
[06:51:53] <louipc> everything needs to happen in correct sequence
[06:52:33] <piercedwater> ifi makes good stuff if that's the kind of hw you're talking about. maybe i just don't know what audio processing unit is....probably the case
[06:52:47] <louipc> i just made that up ;)
[06:53:05] <sublim20> lying?  ON THE INTERNET?!
[06:53:14] <piercedwater> NO
[06:53:22] <piercedwater> everything is true on the internet duh
[06:53:24] <louipc> how dare you
[06:53:34] <sublim20> GET HIM
[06:53:35] <efex> lous	yes good name for that
[06:54:37] <louipc> a music computer could be used for lightshow and video mixing
[06:54:47] <efex> quite right… low latency is the thing… gpu and grqphics just dont mattwer so anything that runs a screen is fine
[06:54:48] <louipc> lightshow/lasershow uses midi i think
[06:55:02] <louipc> so you'd call that more like a media computer
[06:55:10] <efex> sure use MIDI to drive the lights
[06:55:15] <louipc> ya
[06:55:38] <louipc> still has same deterministic requirements as music applications
[06:56:48] <efex> it would be fun to get a new screen but I have a gamer screen tat’s ok.. a cheapo 21/9
[06:57:08] <louipc> i used to lurk by the audio booth at concerts :p
[06:59:16] <efex> audio is full of knobs and faders and lights!  love all that ehehe
