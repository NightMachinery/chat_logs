[00:52:10] <nazarii[m]> if it happens often that you have `setup` for missing plugin you can wrap require call in exception handling block. Here is some random example from github https://github.com/saifulapm/nvim/blob/8ff1a08a634b526c5daeb9cc0258affdce566ca3/lua/plugins/configs/others.lua#L25-L36

[00:54:48] *** Joins: cliluw (~cliluw@47.147.80.149)
[00:55:31] <dmitmeltest[m]> the thing is that it can happen if I am just installing the configuration on some other machine. the plugins are not present when starting the editor, but after VimEnter the plugin manager installs and sources the missing stuff, so if configuration is kept in some global variable (not necessarily on vim.g, a Lua global will do just fine) the plugin will pick it up just fine upon installation.
[00:56:14] <jaawerth[m]> or, sure, pcall. come to think of it in other lua contexts I might use `package.searchpath` but given how the loader is set up now with rtp I'm not sure how that would work, a `vim.searchmodule` or something might not be the worst idea
[00:57:04] <mjlbach[m]> dmitmeltest[m]: TBH it's kinda a "packer/X doesn't have a blocking install" sorta thing
[00:57:10] <mjlbach[m]> if we had blocking installs then it wouldn't be a big deal
[00:57:15] <mjlbach[m]> just "ensure_installed" = true
[00:57:25] <mjlbach[m]> as it stands you can load your configuration in an autocommand but it's kinda hacky

[01:00:10] <jaawerth[m]> this is where things like a lightweight layer framework could potentially be useful, imo. granted, folks won't necessarily want to wrap all their per-plugin setup in separate callbacks, which you'd probably need to do
[01:00:32] <jaawerth[m]> but it would make it easier to defer things or re-check upon install etc
[01:00:32] <dmitmeltest[m]> layer framework?
[01:02:05] <jaawerth[m]> well I was thinking along the lines of a lighter-weight thing along the lines of what spacefoo does, but really it could be done on a per-plugin-name basis too. just more flow control is what I mean, in a predictable but extensible way. though it's been tried in many ways and there's a reason it hasn't dominated the ecosystem
[01:02:14] <jaawerth[m]> packer is already a lovely improvement, I'm not greedy

[01:06:42] <jaawerth[m]> well, to be clear i now regret saying layers because it wasn't really what I was talking about, and I found it a bit too much of an abstraction when I tried spacemacs. but think about it in terms of grouping up chunks of code (including plugins and any config for them you might add via hooks) into namespaces that you can arrange in a stack.  so you might have an autocomplete layer that does your autocomplete setup and loads your relevant
[01:06:42] <jaawerth[m]> plugins + custom bindings etc
[01:07:53] <jaawerth[m]> in spacemacs/spacevim I think it gives you too much out of the box so you end up having to figure out what the builtins do, but I like the idea of, say, putting plugins x, y, an z under `lua-dev`, and if you register plugin x, you could have code that only runs when x is present. that kinda thing. but easier said than done cleanly
[01:08:57] <jaawerth[m]> also in lua it's not exactly ergonomic to write tons of `function() ... return whtever end`

[01:25:03] <gpanders> there is also https://github.com/gpanders/nvim-moonwalk
[01:25:03] <saltrocklamp[m]> yeah i had a hacky version too at one point. in my case, i injected fennel into the package loaders list
[01:25:04] <gpanders> which was written by the author as a more minimal version of hotpot :)

[01:54:13] <jaawerth[m]> I think the main downside I've noticed to lua as a compiler target is that in fennel's case it could be a great platform-agnostic lisp kit, except because it was built with lua in mind, there's a bunch of stuff in the compiler that assumes multiple returns are a thing. you can hack around that with tuples but that's extra runtime overhead
[01:54:52] <jaawerth[m]> though this still could have been accounted for had fennel been designed with an extensible list of compiler targets from the beginning; but doing that cleanly is a lot of design work no matter what your first host language is
[01:55:59] <jaawerth[m]> otherwise, it's great. Things like `package.preload` even made it easy to turn the fennel compiler into a bundler for itself
[01:57:29] <saltrocklamp[m]> jaawerth[m]: i think that's a lot more work though. and you end up effectively having one "blessed" target along with a bunch of second-class targets

[01:58:06] <saltrocklamp[m]> i think we're still in the early stages of being able to design such systems effectively, overall
[01:58:12] <jaawerth[m]> true, because most languages have its own snowflake semantics that make the theory -> practice way more complicated than it looks on paper
[01:58:29] <jaawerth[m]> multiple returns is just one of the stickier ones
[01:58:29] <saltrocklamp[m]> i also think that in general, fennel people prefer the fact that fennel is a relatively thin layer over lua
[01:58:38] <saltrocklamp[m]> like how i personally enjoy the fact that hy is a relatively thin layer over python
[01:58:50] <jaawerth[m]> yeah, since that's one of the core design goals from the start
[01:59:04] <saltrocklamp[m]> yeah, that too. every language has different semantics and optimizes for different things. that's one reason why we have so many languages!
[01:59:32] <jaawerth[m]> but someday I want to make a lisp kit that lets you define core operations so it can compile itself to the new host, just to watch the world burn
[02:00:20] <jaawerth[m]> then, spoken word programming language!!!
[02:00:29] <mjlbach[m]> I wish that we could lua as introspectable as a lisp though
[02:00:33] <mjlbach[m]> debugging in emacs is sooo nice
[02:00:38] <mjlbach[m]> hot patch anything
[02:00:41] <mjlbach[m]> advise functions
[02:00:51] <jaawerth[m]> it's not impossible
[02:01:04] <jaawerth[m]> but getting the debug module to do stuff is always annoying
[02:03:22] <bfredl> hot patch is simple as long as patchable attributes is on objects, and not closure upvalues :]
[02:03:44] <jaawerth[m]> yes but then you can't use closure upvalues :[
[02:04:44] <bfredl> you can still use them, just don't expect your patchable state to be there.
[02:05:19] <bfredl> like you could have a nested closure capturing `self` as an upvalue, then you can still manipulate that object
[02:05:57] <jaawerth[m]> yeah - in fennel I always have to remind myself to resist the temptation to do, like, `(local {: thing : other-thing} (require :mymodule))` if I want hotswap to work; it's way more tempting when destructuring is *right there*
[02:06:19] <dre> I've been curious about hy but I have't looked into it yet

[02:32:11] <mjlbach[m]> I generally do not like virtual servers/the concept of null-ls, I would prefer us expose as modules all the features they want and avoid interacting with the RPC loop
[02:32:24] <mjlbach[m]> so we have vim.diagnostic now, they can use that
[02:32:39] <mjlbach[m]> vim.format and vim.code_action I guess are the other things they would want, those would be more contentious

[02:41:35] <jaawerth[m]> that makes sense. null-ls is a nice workaround but it encourages the concept of "these features are meant to go through LSP" rather than "LSP is a protocol you can use to get these capabilities in a portable way"
[02:42:05] <jaawerth[m]> portable/editor-agnostic/whatever-you-wanna-call-it
[02:42:55] <mjlbach[m]> Yes, these are neovim features and there is no reason to fake an RPC loop for something that is mostly in-process :) I guess they want it for slow CLI linters/whatnot

[02:45:50] <mjlbach[m]> Yeah it's not that I don't understand the appeal, but part of the vim.diagnostic move is you can bind to that instead of vim.lsp.diagnostic, and it will work regardless if a server is attached

[02:51:43] <dre> forgive my ignorance, but why do things like linters and formatters fall under diagnostic? it was the same as CoC
[02:51:53] <clason[m]> if you wait a little longer, you can even start playing with 0.7.0 nightlies :}
[02:52:05] <dre> I had to configure the diagnostic-lsp or whatever, to format / fix the code. 
[02:59:18] <dre> is it placebo or are things faster when using lua counterparts 
[03:02:02] <YorickPeterse[m]> dre: did you mean null-lsp?
[03:02:37] <dre> YorickPeterse[m], no, my old setup was using CoC and i had to configure "diagnostics" to run flake and black iirc.
[03:03:25] <dre> although now that I'm looking at it, I actually think it was ALE that was running black and flake.. I dunno, but I'd like to convert over to the proper lspconfig stuff.

[03:04:21] <YorickPeterse[m]> nvim itself doesn't do anything for linters
[03:04:42] <YorickPeterse[m]> If you are referring to `vim.diagnostic`, that's just an API for presenting diagnostics
[03:08:55] <YorickPeterse[m]> the lspconfig project solely focuses on configuring language servers. For running regular linters you'll need null-lsp or similar plugins

[04:14:00] <sb[m]1> When you bother about stability, you should probably simply fix the tags of the plugins you're using. I see you're using paq which doesn't support this. Maybe switch to Packer.nvim, there you can say e.g. `tag = "v0.3.0"` for your plugin, or `commit = "f00dead"` and then your plugin is stable. When you're in the mood, you can update your plugin by removing the commit/tag declaration and see if everything works, then fix a new one.
[04:14:00] <sb[m]1> I am not sure if SemVer would help you here. Even because SemVer-using software (including nvim plugins) tends to stay in major version 0, where SemVer is essentially useless.
[04:14:25] <phaazon[m]> I’m using packer
[04:14:31] <phaazon[m]> and plugins I maintain are versioned
[04:14:47] <phaazon[m]> for instance if you want to use hop.nvim, I recommend using the `branch = v1` for now
[04:14:59] <sb[m]1> phaazon[m]: oh sorry, I only scrolled vaguely about your config and saw plugins.json with `paq`
[04:15:13] <jaawerth[m]> semver drift for git tags where applicable would be a nice plugin manager feature but, as with anything, it would rely on authors following the conventions of semver
[04:15:17] <jaawerth[m]> which is a questionable prospect even in platforms that enforce semver
[04:15:33] <phaazon[m]> for things like commands, it works
[04:15:36] <phaazon[m]> (at least it works for Hop)
[04:15:54] <phaazon[m]> for API, it doesn’t, because we need a « real » package manager enforcing semver, being able to know about package indexes, etc.
[04:16:03] <phaazon[m]> i.e. it will probably never happen

[04:17:25] <jaawerth[m]> I mean even packer could do semver drift, you just need  manager that knows how to interpret semver ranges. the limiter is the publishing side not encouraging authors to do the tagging
[04:17:50] <jaawerth[m]> even in 0.x versions it cna still help even if the conventions are wobblier there
[04:17:58] <jaawerth[m]> but I have no idea how many plugin authors even tag releases

[04:19:04] <jaawerth[m]> but even in npm, which enforces semver on both ends, there are plenty of modules where the author makes breaking changes in a semver-minor or semver-patch update
[04:19:10] <jaawerth[m]> it's all just.. guidelines really
[04:19:16] <jaawerth[m]> (i still like it)

[04:19:46] <sb[m]1> jaawerth[m]: In my experience, the tendency goes the way that authors tend to tag their releases, but the git tag is the only hint about the version number. No mention anywhere else (because it would be more work to update that)

[04:20:56] <mjlbach[m]> production readiness is self-declared :) 
[04:21:08] <jaawerth[m]> understandably so - especially since between releases the best thing to do is geneerally a variation of git describe --long for the dev versions but then you have to pick the cleanest way to automate that and magic commits are...
[04:21:18] <mjlbach[m]> lspconfig will perpetually live in 0ver when once I tag release 0.1 around the launch of 0.6
[04:21:39] <phaazon[m]> mjlbach: it is it is, I wonder whether people are actually using what I do
[04:21:42] <phaazon[m]> it’s more effort
[04:21:52] <phaazon[m]> when I want to make a new release, I have to create a tag, and switch branches to rebase them correctly

[05:16:26] <harwiltz> Hello all. I've been a vim user for a long time, but about a year ago I started using emacs, mainly because of elisp vs VimL and org-mode (with evil-mode of course). However I've been missing the simplicity of vim, and since the lua support in neovim looks really good these days, I decided to give it a try, and I have to say I'm loving it.
[05:17:04] *** Quits: gggp (~gggp@li2010-23.members.linode.com) (Quit: My MacBook has gone to sleep. ZZZzzz…)
[05:17:58] <gpanders> Glad you're hear :) We also have a Discourse if you have any long form questions: https://neovim.discourse.group/
[05:18:05] <gpanders> wow, s/hear/here
[05:19:42] <harwiltz> However, there is one thing that I really miss about emacs. I'm a graduate student and I spend lots of time writing quick mathematical notes, say to develop a new idea of some sort. In emacs I'd use org-mode with the inline latex preview feature, which was quite good. I know this won't be easy to replicate with neovim, but really all I need is a lightweight method to preview markdown with math
[05:19:44] <harwiltz> quickly, say via a markdown renderer of some sort. Is there a commonly-known solution for this?
[05:19:50] <harwiltz> gpanders: Ah, thanks. I can try there as well.

[05:24:15] <gpanders> harwiltz: I can share what I do, though it may not be an optimal solution. I created a pandoc compiler plugin (`:h :compiler`) and which I use in Markdown documents. This sets the `'makeprg'` option (`:h 'makeprg'`) meaning I can just use `:make` to convert the Markdown in my buffer into whatever output format I want. If I have the resulting HTML or PDF or whatever open in my browser then I can just refresh as necessary to view the changes
[05:24:15] <nvim-bot[m]> Links to referenced help pages:
[05:24:16] <nvim-bot[m]> * [`:compiler`](https://neovim.io/doc/user/quickfix.html#:compiler) in *quickfix.txt*
[05:24:16] <nvim-bot[m]> * [`'makeprg'`](https://neovim.io/doc/user/options.html#'makeprg') in *options.txt*
[05:24:16] <gpanders> you could extend that approach to run `:make` every time you save with a `BufWritePost` autocommand
[05:24:17] <mjlbach[m]> also fvim has support for inline latex IIRC
[05:24:17] <mjlbach[m]> via some UI widget
[05:24:18] <mjlbach[m]> harwiltz: you can use vimtex with zathura/synctex for a side by side
[05:24:30] *** Quits: rgrinberg (~textual@190.113.102.153) (Quit: My MacBook has gone to sleep. ZZZzzz…)
[05:24:46] <gpanders> yes if you're using LaTeX vimtex is 100% the way to go
[05:25:20] <harwiltz> gpanders: Yes! I was planning on using pandoc in the same way, but I think it would be annoying to have to keep switching to the browser and refresing.
[05:25:51] <gpanders> yea it's a low-tech solution for sure :)

[05:26:28] <harwiltz> mjlbach[m]: So I do use vimtex (which is great), but I like to generate html for a website for later browsing.
[05:26:40] <harwiltz> mjlbach[m]: I'll look into fvim, never heard of that!
[05:26:47] <mjlbach[m]> It's a GUI :) 
[05:26:52] <mjlbach[m]> (Also a graduate student)
[05:27:08] <harwiltz> Sweet
[05:27:10] <mjlbach[m]> I think you can compile the latex to html via some vimtex thing if you want to do it all within vim
[05:27:29] <harwiltz> mjlbach[m]: Well now that you mention it... I can use pandoc :D
[05:28:14] <mjlbach[m]> Also I assume you're aware of orgmode.nvim
[05:28:41] <harwiltz> mjlbach[m]: I am aware of it, but I have yet to look into it in detail 
[05:29:04] <harwiltz> Tbh the idea of generating latex pdfs and then generating html "offline" just completely evaded me...
[05:29:27] <harwiltz> Thanks so much for all the suggestions!
[05:30:11] <mjlbach[m]> no worries :) ltex-ls and texlab are also worth checking out

[20:29:15] <mjlbach[m]> it should be "disallowed root checker"
[20:29:16] <mjlbach[m]> or something of the like
[20:29:16] <mjlbach[m]> and also check for vim.fn.cwd

[20:30:08] <kylo252[m]> mjlbach[m]: I was just following the original `pattern` 
[20:30:08] <kylo252[m]> can I extract this to a script instead of trying to write it in a yaml file?
[20:30:46] <mjlbach[m]> if necessary, I'd prefer it be one file so I can wipe it in a couple months
[20:30:53] <mjlbach[m]> also don't spend too much time on this...
[20:30:59] <mjlbach[m]> it was just to yell at people on my behalf
[20:31:08] <kylo252[m]> it's basically `ci/run_<rule>.sh` with like 4-5 lines

[21:00:11] <Bowuigi[m]> If the changes are not being applied, load the colorscheme before the plugins, as the colorscheme might be deleting the highlighting group

[21:00:28] <clason[m]> if you have a proper color scheme, _all_ `highlight` calls in your config _must_ go through a `ColorScheme` autocommand
[21:00:44] <zostj> Bowuigi[m]: let me try :D
[21:01:35] <clason[m]> what do you mean "nothing is applied"
