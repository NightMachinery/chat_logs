[01:35:43] <int0x1C8> trying to get the certs for mitel working, but you can't take multiple csr requests and combine them on godaddy it seems
[01:35:58] <CptLuxx> *.bla.com
[01:36:00] <CptLuxx> woooh
[01:36:02] <CptLuxx> a wildcard cert
[01:36:03] <int0x1C8> you can only do them one at a time which rekeys the cert, and invalidates the previous certs
[01:36:19] <sd> 06<N​injaStyle> Weird
[01:37:07] <int0x1C8> unless I'm missing something, is it not normal to be able to specify the private key for a csr?
[01:37:15] <CptLuxx> lol wat
[01:37:52] <int0x1C8> hell I don't even really know what a csr is
[01:38:48] <Activ8> do you not have a backup of the wildcard keys
[01:39:51] <int0x1C8> do they work both ways?
[01:40:12] <Activ8> where you using them on
[01:40:25] <int0x1C8> like to get it to work I take a csr from mitel and have godaddy give me a cert
[01:41:17] <Activ8> I'm confused lol do you have the wildcard cert for *.domain.cum
[01:41:17] <int0x1C8> fuckit nevermind I don't know enough to even know what the terminology means, I need to go back to basics
[01:41:23] <CptLuxx> dude
[01:41:24] <CptLuxx> get the csr
[01:41:30] <CptLuxx> upload it to whatever ca
[01:41:32] *** Quits: vinrock (~vinrock@user/vinrock) (Quit: weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee)
[01:41:37] <CptLuxx> you get a cert back.. you import it on the mitel
[01:41:39] <CptLuxx> bam done
[01:41:43] <int0x1C8> right, but that rekeys the cert
[01:41:49] <CptLuxx> the moment you create the csr the mitel makes the private key..
[01:42:12] <int0x1C8> which invalidates the previous certs
[01:42:13] <CptLuxx> or create the cert somewhere else and export it in a format the mitel wants..
[01:42:16] <CptLuxx> and?
[01:42:24] <CptLuxx> whats the issue with that? 
[01:42:39] <CptLuxx> the old cert will still be valid till you replace it
[01:42:44] <int0x1C8> its 3 different csrs
[01:43:03] <CptLuxx> so you need a cert for 3 domains?
[01:43:10] <int0x1C8> the PBX cert, mobility router cert, and conferencing cert, all different appliances
[01:43:13] <int0x1C8> different host names
[01:43:16] <int0x1C8> same domain
[01:43:20] <CptLuxx> then get a wildcard..
[01:43:22] <int0x1C8> we did
[01:43:24] <CptLuxx> or make a san certificate
[01:44:49] <Activ8> you only need one wildcard cert per domain you shouldn't have to do anything else except import it in the right format

[02:08:04] <int0x1C8> I mean everythings working now, but we don't know if one or more of the certs will expire because every time godaddy processes a csr it rekeys our cert
[02:08:35] <CptLuxx> and why should it expire then?
[02:09:39] <int0x1C8> yeah it would necessarily have to rekey the cert since the cert is a function of the csr and private key

[02:34:38] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> in the early 2000's spam mail was a HUGE problem

[02:35:23] <Activ8> in this day and age I still don't understand how people are getting away with it

[02:35:39] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> getting away with what?
[02:35:59] <Work-BWMerlin> spam?
[02:36:04] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> open relay usually goes to spam
[02:36:10] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> but in a lot of cases it doesn't
[02:36:11] <Activ8> hacking, exploitation, spam e.t.c 
[02:36:35] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> i think with email, if you've been doing it wrong for 20 years, you can keep doing it wrong
[02:36:47] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> but if you're starting out new, then you must get everything right
[02:36:56] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> otherwise it's not going to work
[02:37:02] <Activ8> I'm going to check my logs now see if I can see anything suspicious, what helps is that I have a proxy so to do anything you have to be hitting my urls
[02:37:08] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> email is a combination of very old protocols
[02:37:16] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> Activ8: cloudflare?
[02:37:28] <Activ8> I was talking to you about it not long ago about a front facing proxy so it looks like everything comes from port 80 when in fact it doesn't
[02:37:35] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> I would use CF but then I'd need to make them authoritative for my zones
[02:37:45] <Activ8> cloudflare is a top layer
[02:38:01] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> yeah but they need me to change my nameservers to theirs
[02:38:05] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> which I refuse to do
[02:38:37] <Activ8> on my line I have a reverse proxy that gets hit first
[02:38:49] <DrZak> oooh, if you REALLY need to look like a freak https://gethushme.com/
[02:38:54] <Activ8> for the protection it's worth it I think personally
[02:38:56] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> and that forwards the requests to the correct thing?
[02:38:59] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> Activ8
[02:39:02] <Activ8> yes sysadmin 
[02:39:18] <Activ8> my services are via a url with no port even though it's filtered through 80 > another port
[02:39:21] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> DrZak: wtf is that crap
[02:39:30] <Activ8> you use nginx don't you?
[02:39:31] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> Activ8: I get it
[02:39:39] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> I just use a VPN for everything
[02:39:44] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> VPN into my network
[02:39:52] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> not for privacy but for security
[02:40:05] <Activ8> ditto 
[02:40:11] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> and yes, I do use Nginx
[02:40:14] <Activ8> outside > in (vpn)
[02:40:19] <Activ8> we spoke about it last week I think
[02:40:23] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> like most of the world uses Nginx
[02:40:27] <Activ8> I use caddy

[02:40:46] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> no wasn't me Activ8
[02:40:57] <Activ8> I'm sure it was I'll check my logs :)
[02:41:02] <Activ8> maybe the week before
[02:41:11] <Activ8> not that it matters
[02:41:15] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> yeah
[02:41:29] <Activ8> take a look at caddy when you get a moment
[02:41:45] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> I've used it in the past
[02:41:51] <Activ8> ah
[02:42:00] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> I prefer nginx because of it's flexibility
[02:42:00] <Activ8> I have never used nginx I still need to take a look at it
[02:42:29] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> I prefer nginx over caddy because it's very flexible and I have it configured the way I want to
[02:42:45] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> so to switch to caddy would be a lot of work that I don't need right now lol
[02:42:57] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> already very busy as is
[02:43:30] <Activ8> Just checked my server logs, 0 attempts not even a password attempt
[02:45:57] <Activ8> ah hold on, I have had attempts on my webmin interface but that's very odd because that interface isn't front facing
[02:46:11] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> I don't really care because it's just going to 404
[02:46:14] <Activ8> my fail2ban blocked it after 5 failed attempts
[02:46:19] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> there's no Java here
[02:46:52] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> but I get a BUNCH of phpMyAdmin requests, webmin requests, Joomla requests, WordPress requests
[02:47:05] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> none of those things are on my server
[02:47:09] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> except for WordPress

[02:48:56] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> that's not a real email
[02:49:05] <Activ8> I'm a little confused how someones got to that interface only port I have open is 80 and 443 and I don't have a rproxy enabled on that ip/domain
[02:49:14] <SantaGibby> someone send beer, pls
[02:49:46] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> Activ8: webmin?
[02:50:06] <Activ8> yeh webmin it's not possible to access that externally on my network
[02:50:10] <Activ8> very bizare
[02:50:13] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> because they're probably brute forcing potential URLs and webmin just happened to be one of them
[02:50:26] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> they didn't actually hit your webmin instance
[02:50:37] <Activ8> possibly yes
[02:50:40] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> again
[02:50:45] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> I get a bunch of webmin requests

[02:50:59] <Activ8> yeh
[02:51:06] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> it's automated bots just trying random URLs
[02:51:07] <Activ8> that's what that might be then

[14:44:51] <Activ8> If I do 1 off tasks it can go to about $100 an hour
[14:45:42] <lancehead> Yeah people do tend to earn more here as well luckily 
[14:46:00] <Activ8> I'm in the UK
[14:46:22] <lancehead> I'd say average is like 18-20/hr unless you're in the food bizz
[14:46:55] <Activ8> yeh
[14:46:56] <yuken> well lancehead, all I know is that I'd rather join the military than that kind of wage. The pay isn't too much higher to start off with, but I get free housing, free food, and a pension afterwards.
[14:47:07] <lancehead> And free PTSD! 
[14:47:08] <yuken> And if I'm not employeed at a decent rate in the next few months, I am.
[14:47:47] <lancehead> Go for JROTC if you can, yuken. Don't become infantry or something 
[14:47:56] <yuken> lancehead, I am not going to college/university.
[14:48:09] <yuken> Even if it's free.
[14:48:15] <lancehead> Why?
[14:48:42] <yuken> I would be required to take bullshit courses that are completely irrelevant to what I actually want to do.
[14:48:50] <yuken> I don't need to write an essay on Marx if I want to do EE/CE.
[14:48:54] <lancehead> Also, JROTC isn't something public, keep in mind. It'll be other junior officers
[14:49:05] <lancehead> And usually pretty relevant to the actual job
[14:49:34] <lancehead> Military educations don't tend to beat around the bush with irrelevant shit, at least not here 
[14:49:35] <yuken> Also I'm not sure if I'd even qualify for JROTC, being well above high school age.
[14:49:59] <csws> dammit yuken you gotta wait until I get there
[14:50:22] <lancehead> Just ROTC then, yuken 
[14:51:12] <yuken> Also I need my GED, which I should have gotten already but shrug.
[14:52:15] <Activ8> I'm on adding a vpn connection to a laptop, user wants to take it home with them over the crimbo period but needs to test before hand
[14:52:28] <lancehead> Oh fuck I have to buy an awful christmas sweater before tomorrow 
[14:52:34] <lancehead> Tomorrow is awful christmas sweater day at work 
[14:52:41] <Activ8> I have an awesome fat santa jumper 
[14:52:54] <Activ8> when you hit the belly it goes ho ho ho merry christmas lol
[14:53:08] <yuken> lancehead, well git on it, stores open soon.
[14:53:11] <yuken> oh wait you're a dutchie
[14:53:13] <yuken> they're open now.
[14:53:32] <SirSantalot> it's midday, they might be closed until 1pm
[14:53:45] <yuken> what kind of weird time is that?
[14:53:54] <lancehead> Stores up here open pretty early, SirSantalot
[14:54:16] <Activ8> I get paid friday so off shopping then
[14:54:43] <SirSantalot> Activ8, but you'll be late for lance's ugly sweater day!
[14:54:49] <yuken> lancehead, yeah, I might as well look into AFROTC and see what happens. If I don't have to do the bullshit normally associated with university, I'll totally go.
[14:54:54] <yuken> So if I can just take CE & EE courses...
[14:54:57] <SirSantalot> yuken, it's like midnight, but during the day
[14:55:03] <Activ8> hehe
[14:55:23] <lancehead> Air force!? Might as well go sit behind a gas station with a sign that says "sucking penis for money" @ yuken /s
[14:55:37] <yuken> lancehead, for enough money, sure.
[14:55:47] <lancehead> Hahaha you'll fit right in 
[14:56:00] <lancehead> Hey at least it isn't the coast guard 
[14:56:25] <lancehead> Or the navy, actually. Navy's probably worse.
[14:56:27] <SirSantalot> is the coast guard military?
[14:56:30] <yuken> Coast guard has the highest standards and best training, lancehead.
[14:56:31] <lancehead> Yes 
[14:56:40] <lancehead> True yuken, but they're also completely forgotten about 
[14:56:45] <SirSantalot> huh
[14:56:53] <yuken> Also probably the most likely group to get in a firefight r/n lancehead 
[14:56:55] <yuken> lol
[14:56:56] <SirSantalot> I thought they were some sort of police, not some sort of military
[14:57:14] <SirSantalot> TIL
[14:57:25] <lancehead> Yeah that's an easy mistake to make 
[14:57:46] <lancehead> I don't think NL even has an armed coast guard 
[14:57:58] <yuken> https://afrotc.osu.edu/ let's see...
[14:58:00] <lancehead> If something happens in the ocean near us we just send marines out lol 
[14:58:28] <yuken> lancehead, I may not  be accepted into any ROTC shizz in the first place though
[14:58:32] <lancehead> yuken, I considered joining the airmobile brigade here but then I got fat
[14:58:34] <yuken> Considering my GPA was 2nd lowest in my school at 1.38,.
[14:58:55] <lancehead> And I got a girlfriend that doesn't want me to that I love very much 
[14:58:59] <lancehead> So no dice lol 
[14:59:28] <yuken> god rthat is a shitty web page.
[14:59:45] <ender> …I wonder if the log4j vulnerability can be exploited by a SSID somewhere close to UniFi Controller (since the UI does keep track of nearby networks)
[15:00:03] <yuken> I'm not even sure how I'd see if I am able to apply lancehead, wtf

[20:15:31] <mistiry> i enjoy the engineering stuff though. making redstone stuff.

[20:27:52] <mistiry> yeah i use w11 at home
[20:28:25] <mistiry> haise01: problem is that since i already have vscode open 99% of the time, using terminal is just another window to have open
[20:28:47] <mistiry> and i dont admin windows boxes, so its not like i need a bunch of cmd and powershell and wsl stuff all open at once
[20:29:08] <nobyk> I'd prefer the extra window because I can alt tab without taking my hands off the keyboard
