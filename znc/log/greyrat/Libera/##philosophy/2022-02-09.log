[03:29:43] <inhahe_> huoy99: don't know what their particular argument is but most people say that being controlled by randomness isn't any more meaningful than being controlled by deterministic forces
[03:30:03] <inhahe_> if it's random, how is that a decision, or something originating from your will
[03:42:42] <inhahe_> personally, I think deterministic vs. meaninglessly random is a false dichotomy. the universe could have a meaningfully non-mechanistic aspect, which would appear to us as "absolute randomness" because we can't model it and control/predict it mathematically
[03:43:09] <mycroftiv> i have talked on this theme a lot but i dont have the time to dive back in at this moment. as always there is a lot of unwrapping of definitions. when i say 'i want to integrate randomness into my Willing' i can choose to drive to a place i dont know
[03:43:27] <mycroftiv> and then follow random associations from the street names for deciding my next exploratory turn
[03:44:25] <mycroftiv> i am in control of the vehicle im driving, but if i add some fair conflips in at ambiguous branches, what emerges is a complex narrative of my past associations interacting with the namers of the streets i drive, and a bit of 'what the universe wills', with myself always able to drive home for food or whatever
[03:45:19] <mycroftiv> if you analytically deconstruct this and use 'oppositional definitions' then you can say no 'free will' is involved in any of this, but with 'supportive understanding' definitions, i think this captures a lot of freedom and a lot of willing together
[03:45:56] <mycroftiv> NE way, out for abit for gaming, gonna doki doki since its very on theme for how to bring fictions into reality and make reality as malleable as computer software
[03:46:31] <mycroftiv> such willingly random drives are also even better with a good copilot or nav team
[03:47:03] <mycroftiv> and are surprisingly effective at serendipitously moving the story along, sometimes

[15:11:28] <POLO> no
[15:11:33] <POLO> just messing
[15:11:35] <Lumine> Well, one of them regards the misconception of the present moment being just a hairline on a clock. That it's so fleeting and short, that we can't really think in terms of the present. It always regresses into the past or is about the future. But my argument is that the present moment is more like the oval in your eye, where this is a field of perception where the outlines of it become fuzzy. And within that field, the whole universe is
[15:11:35] <Lumine> happening simultaneously.
[15:12:05] <POLO> BOOM
[15:12:08] <POLO> nailed it
[15:12:12] <POLO> and also
[15:12:20] <POLO> one that does not know one thing......knows another
[15:15:19] <Lumine> But because we can reflect on the past, or anticipate or predict, we think that there is no present, to be in. But the truth of the matter is that even those thoughts about the past or the future happen in the now, there's no escaping it.
[15:16:29] <Lumine> And the present is more than just an atto-second
[15:16:39] <POLO> i cant even anything
[15:18:38] <Lumine> Just as you can take a look around, and see up to a point, so it is with the present. Only, our conscious attention selects input from the total gamut, and then comes to regard it all as highly limited.
[15:19:39] <inhahe_> Why does the point of our conscious attention necessarily progress linearly at a constant rate from past to future?
[15:19:58] <Lumine> Because we are taught to do so
[15:20:31] <inhahe_> By whom or what and why?
[15:20:57] <Lumine> By our educational system largely, and by a subtle interaction with other people.
[15:21:06] <Lumine> Who in turn have learned it
[15:21:10] <Lumine> And so it goes
[15:22:00] <Lumine> Why? Because we can't help it, it's too convenient
[15:22:19] <Lumine> In predicting and reflecting and using that information to navigate
[15:23:04] <inhahe_> If the future already exists, do we have no control over it?
[15:23:28] <Lumine> Only the true future is unknown

[15:24:30] <POLO> i have to tell YOU about the future
[15:24:30] <inhahe_> Wouldn't predicting and navigating be easier if we allowed ourselves to change our attention to the future and back to the present, remembering what we saw?
[15:24:47] <POLO> is that not memory

[15:28:17] <Lumine> My point is, that we need these things, so we can function, but at the same time they're proving to be too much for us. Because nothing gives more way for anxiety than imagining the future, which isn't there.
[15:28:37] <Lumine> arryana: hey
[15:28:59] <amigojapan> Lumine: I think it is unknown if the past stops existing when time advances. Perhaps only the present exists, perhaps the past present and future exist

[15:34:18] <Lumine> amigojapan: yeah, my point exactly

[15:36:08] <amigojapan> Lumine: the only agreement in my life for destiny existing. Is from passional experience
[15:36:48] <Lumine> Yeah I don't subscribe to destiny

[15:37:13] <POLO> all got life down here
[15:37:41] <amigojapan> Lumine: pretty sure destiny is a thing. There are too many variables that could have gone wrong in meeting my wife
[15:37:55] <Lumine> amigojapan: that's your opinion
[15:38:05] <amigojapan> It is Lumine
[15:38:41] <amigojapan> Lumine: everything I ever day is always my opinion
[15:38:44] <Lumine> I do however believe that we have a certain extent to which we can change our reality
[15:38:47] <amigojapan> Say*
[15:39:22] <Lumine> But there's no destination, that I ought to arrive at
[15:39:45] <amigojapan> Lumine: there are two kinds of destiny. Shukumei which is what we can't change and unmei which is what we can change
[15:40:04] <Lumine> Is this shintoism?
[15:40:11] <amigojapan> Yeah
[15:40:39] <Lumine> I need to pee, brb
[15:40:50] <amigojapan> Me too brb
[15:44:48] <amigojapan> Lumine: let alone Shintoism, it's just common sense. There are things we can change and things we can't. Both those words are usually translated as destiny into English. But even forgetting the word "destiny" I think we can agree that there are some things we can change and others we can't. Japan just have a name to each
[15:45:11] <Lumine> Sure
[15:45:15] <Lumine> I'm not arguing with that
[15:45:22] <amigojapan> Ok
[15:46:58] <Lumine> My argument was that we A. can't think of past or future without the present and B. you always need an entity or consciousness to make statements on any of them. If there is not that, none of them exist in their own right.
[15:47:54] <amigojapan> Umm I guess I agree with that

[16:05:39] *** Joins: qu4nt1n (~qu4nt1n@78.198.214.34)
[16:06:03] <Lumine> This regards an attitude that I have never had anyone share with me. But, someone once said that existence is a dance. And that the patterns of life is analogous to a play. Not in the sense of taking life as mere triviality, but in the sense for example when you listen to Bach play the piano. It is not trivial, but it is play. And this is tied to one's attitude regarding anything that could be considered mundane. For someone who sees and
[16:06:03] <Lumine> feels that life is a dance, they tend to see enjoyment in almost everything that they do.
[16:06:10] <Lumine> But this might be construed as being hedonistic. Rather, it is being completely engaged in whatever activity they're participating in. And this might be called living in the present moment. But this attitude of dancing is nonetheless attractive to me, not because it suggests aimlessness to phenomena, but because it frees them from certain predicaments. If you think that life has a serious purpose, than it becomes a drag, and not a dance.

[16:08:13] <Lumine> Not at all
[16:08:32] <inhahe_> We take things seriously, like work for example, because we fear the consequences of not doing that. Even if we take life as a dance, those potential consequences are still very real.
[16:09:04] <POLO> thats where we differ

[16:09:32] <POLO> but the key or ruit is the source

[16:10:31] <POLO> r you it?
[16:11:29] <Lumine> inhahe_: what is the consequence of not taking things too seriously? Getting fired? I argue that one can certainly consider it being a dance and still contribute to whatever occupation they feel necessary to contribute.
[16:12:36] <Lumine> It all depends on adaptation
[16:16:00] <amigojapan> Lumine: I had not heard of a dance before but I have certainly heard of people claim "life is a videogame"
[16:16:10] <Lumine> If you've never considered the attitude with it's correlative adaptation, then it is extremely difficult. And results mostly in "office shenanigangs" and being the office clown and possible getting backlash. But if you adapt to the situation and find a way to be yourself while still taking it in strides.
[16:16:35] <Lumine> Then it can actually become part of you

[16:18:24] <Lumine> I don't subscribe to that idea at all
[16:19:00] <Lumine> For one thing, there are several philosophies which I happen to agree with, that you can't simply "win" in life.
[16:19:13] <Lumine> Because winning implies losing
[16:19:33] <inhahe_> Btw, the idea that life is essentially a dance isn't new to me at all. And I think it may me ideal. But it's not necessarily easy to get into that headspace.

[16:20:26] <inhahe_> We're dancing in a war zone.
[16:20:32] <Lumine> I disagree with forcing it
[16:20:43] <Lumine> There is no point to that
[16:22:31] <Lumine> If you're forcing yourself to have a different state of mind, what is the value of arriving there as opposed to genuinely feeling it? It's like forcing yourself to love someone.
[16:23:22] <inhahe_> yeah, i agree
[16:23:33] <inhahe_> just can't imagine how i would see life as a dance without forcing it
[16:24:39] <Lumine> Well it's like this. You abandon all your notions of what life ought to be. Let it all hang. And when you do that, finally, you discover that you have newfound energy. And you can use that energy in ways you hadn't thought of before. That's the difference.

[20:12:28] <ro-bot-o> mrig meant to say: well if you compare go to meditation, I would need to clarify to you what meditation means to me perhaps; I think that was perhaps my point, more so just a passing comment.
[20:13:54] <Lumine> Dhyana, zen, yoga, all means to me that fundamental state of mind where there is no problem. That is my definition for meditation. Where one stops getting caught up in going in circles with their thoughts, and has been overcome by the hypnosis of words, symbols, or numbers.
[20:14:13] <Lumine> Has overcome*
[20:14:17] <mrig> I do see what you mean, and was perhaps being a little facetious, for which I apologise; It is great that western language has adopted the term meditation now.
[20:14:21] <mrig> Yes quite.
[20:16:04] <Lumine> But differing schools have differing opinions as to what the highest state of meditation is.
[20:16:19] <mrig> Oh that said "meditacioun, "contemplation; devout preoccupation; private devotions, prayer," "
[20:16:25] <Lumine> For me it simply means the cessations of conceptions
[20:17:00] <Lumine> Of thoughts *about* what one is experiencing, where we're not evaluating the world around us, fixing labels and so on.
[20:17:07] <mrig> Yes the different schools of thought do have quite different opinions, they do however all seem to go in the same direction though.
[20:18:22] <Lumine> There was somone who said that one can even meditate while they're thinking, when they get up to a certain point

[20:19:31] <Lumine> Where they're not being distracted by their own thoughts anymore
[20:20:16] <mrig> In some schools it is taught as a practice of breathing and is done persistently throughout daily life.
[20:20:35] <Lumine> Yes, breath is the more common of ways

[21:01:32] <ski> one notion of "A or B" is that you determine *which* alternative is the case. this is the additive one. the other notion of "A or B" is that you're claiming that one holds, to the *extent* that the other doesn't. this is the multiplicative one
[21:01:36] <mrig> I was introduced to the term only recently, so it is still in the process of my digestion to be honest.
[21:02:33] <ski> the first notion implies the alternatives being detached, separated, from each other. the second doesn't
[21:02:56] <mrig> Sure, yes so conditions are used to demonstrate points, in its most rudimentary or initial form. As applied by Plato.
[21:03:30] <mrig> I think that Plato is the origin in the western school of thought, as such rather than being mixed up it was perhaps more of a germination?

[21:06:58] <mannequin> there is beauty that is obvious
[21:07:14] <mannequin> and there is beauty tha one has to search for
[21:07:24] <mrig> I suppose boolean logic is the building block of the regular expression.
[21:07:55] <ski> it's when mathematicians started to investigate infinities for real, while still confusing additive vs. multiplicative disjunction, that things started to go more downhill
[21:08:28] <mrig> Is there a down hill in this context?
[21:08:37] <ski> (excluded middle is a theorem, for statements about finite sets)
[21:09:18] <mrig> not entirely, it is also a way of approaching logical though.
[21:09:28] <mrig> Right and wrong, true and false.
[21:10:02] <mrig> One that I would argue that the English language depends quite heavily upon, French too.
[21:10:09] <ski> downhill, in the sense of producing mathematics without "numerical" (computational) content. bold existence statements without any evidence that can be used to find that which is claimed to exist
[21:10:47] <mrig> I do not take mathematical proof as being the only way that things can be known.
[21:10:57] <mrig> Find that it is really quite limited.
[21:11:05] <mrig> For the reasons mentioned.
[21:11:28] <mrig> that You have mentioned, but they are quite logical and obvious reasons though.
[21:11:56] <ski> (all this is also tied up with pretending that you can use an assumption as many times as you like. but assumptions (being "spiritual", in Girard's parlance) generalize to also include resources (which would be "material", i guess, or maybe "physical"), which can't freely duplicate)
[21:12:29] <ski> apparently the Aymara language uses a trivalent logic ..
[21:12:51] <ski> "I do not take mathematical proof as being the only way that things can be known." -- me neither
[21:13:13] <mrig> I don't think that so many philosophers nor theologians were as perturbed by recent mathematical developments as were mathematicians.
[21:13:33] <ski> sounds reasonable
[21:15:18] <ski> mannequin : yes
[21:15:49] <ski> (mathematics is a very aesthetics-oriented discipline)
[21:15:59] <mrig> sanskrit is really polyvalent, one aspect of which is trivalent, but the language also has a 4000 line context free grammar too, this trivalent logic is only a part of that.

[21:17:23] <mrig> Still scratching about at the doorway of understanding though, so early days for any really understanding of how this can be translated to boolean type logic.
[21:18:17] <ski> (yea, i don't really subscribe to any finite-valued approach to logic. to me, the truth-values are a continuum, not discrete. "fuzzy" in a certain sense)
[21:18:54] <mrig> ski: this assumption that you can use an assumption as many times as you like, reminds me of the function of time in calculus.
[21:19:09] <mrig> Very cool really.
[21:19:33] <mrig> How math and philosophy combine in computation in this way.
[21:20:00] <ski> the "reuse assumptions" is exactly why double-negation-elimination / proof-by-contradiction fails, in intuitionistic logic
[21:20:50] <mrig> I am not familiar with intuitionistic logic, will have to go and look that up.
[21:20:54] <ski> mrig : yea, one can view inference in logic as a notion of time passing
[21:21:09] <ski> mrig : it's also often referred to as "constructive logic"
[21:21:20] <mrig> I have come across a notion of temporal logic, and assume that this is similar ground.
[21:21:36] <mrig> right yes.
[21:21:51] <ski> it originates from Brouwer's student, Heyting, who tried to formalize (in an incomplete way), the kinds of arguments that Brouwer was making
[21:22:10] <mrig> this notion is foundational in eastern philosophy, as is seen in such works as kalachakra.
[21:22:16] <mrig> times wheel.
[21:22:47] <mrig> logic being bound to a notion of cyclical time.
[21:22:49] <ski> Brouwer (founder of intuitionism) himself was an anti-formalist, deeply suspicious of language. he was a mystic, had extra-linguistic experiences of math, while meditating
[21:23:09] <mrig> I shall have to look them up, thank you for the pointer.
[21:23:44] <ski> temporal logic talks more explicitly about time, i'd say. it includes operations for "forever", "sometimes", "henceforth", "eventually", ..
[21:25:52] <ski> modern day computing scientists (at least the ones that focus on languages, rather than machines (and algorithms)) very often tend to be constructivists, leaning towards intuitionist logic (since that naturally fits in with computation). they also tend to be quite formalistic, though (which is opposed to the notion of intuitionism, as seen by Brouwer)
[21:26:50] <ski> however, Joachim Lambek (category terrorist), thinks that one ought to be able to reconcile Platonism, Intuitionism, and Formalism (although all three appear at first sight to be mutually exclusive/contradictory)
[21:26:58] <ski> mrig : np
[21:27:01] <mrig> I'm rather taken by the C programming language as it seems to reflect the emergent nature of math, rather than any constructive man made nature.

[21:33:33] <mrig> I will definitely have to find out more about the fellow.
[21:34:53] <mrig> Oh for C it is the way that it is close to binary so that it is readily usable, that memory and space are interconnected and also that a very firm understanding of limits is required to use it well; In fact the limits can by applied as tools themselves.
[21:35:43] <ski> (the debate between Brouwer and Hilbert sparked a deeper investigation into the groundings of math. this got Gödel on the track to his incompleteness theorems, and it also got people (including Gödel,Turing,Church,Post,..) to try to define the notion of computation, which eventually led to (machine) computers)
[21:35:50] <mrig> I find this to be closer to mathematical reality than any language that ties to implement our current standard set of symbols and notion.
[21:36:49] <mrig> I will make a note of the book that you mention, sounds very intriguing.
[21:37:07] <ski> "it is close to binary" -- in some regards, that's a myth, or not as true as people make it out to be. (it used to be more true, with older computers and implementations of C for them)
[21:37:49] <ski> (that's not to say what you said is completely wrong, either)
[21:37:53] <mrig> Sure yes, with memory mapping and the likes, but I mean the number base more so than the actual bits on the machine.
[21:38:03] <ski> number base ?
[21:38:11] <mrig> binary is just base 2
[21:38:23] <mrig> was thinking of it in that context here.
[21:38:35] <ski> ah
[21:38:54] <ski> well, there's such a thing as "boolean blindness"
[21:39:17] <ski> mere bits are data, do not convey (meaningful) information

[21:41:36] <mrig> yes, as a number base, they are fascinating, have a wonderful tie to Sierpinski gaskets and the Fibonacci series.
[21:41:43] <ski> yes
[21:42:09] <mrig> I think it is all sound in the end, the bits are closer to the metal than they are to 'reality' :)
