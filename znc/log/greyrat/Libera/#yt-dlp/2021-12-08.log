[17:58:30] <boON> hi all :)
[17:59:19] <boON>  'noplaylist': True
[17:59:19] <boON> seems not to work at all or maybe not for all playlists?
[18:00:17] <boON> any creative ideas or workarounds how to make only single file downloading possible?
[18:00:25] <boON> thanks!
[18:02:22] <gnoo> boON: --playlist-items 1 ?
[18:17:57] <boON> thanks gnoo :)
[18:17:58] <boON> 'playlist-items': '1',
[18:17:58] <boON> still downloads the complete playlist :/
[18:17:58] <boON> will try next with                            
[18:17:58] <boON> 'playliststart': '1',
[18:17:58] <boON> 'playlistend': '2',
[18:19:13] <gnoo> boON: you're downloading the json?
[18:19:38] <boON> yes ok will test again without json download
[18:26:18] <boON> seems to be a real bug somewhere and not on my end
[18:27:19] <boON> tested 
[18:27:19] <boON> 'playlist-items'
[18:27:19] <boON> it loads complete playlist
[18:27:36] <boON>  'playlistend': '2',
[18:27:36] <boON> error
[18:28:18] <boON> json and addmetadata off to not disturb  
[18:31:14] <boON> guess i have to change my code to work properly for playlists too and also get faster internet connection :/
[18:31:57] <gnoo> there's also --max-downloads
[18:32:17] <gnoo> i haven't really tried the yt-dlp library so it's just guesswork here 
[18:33:58] <boON> good guesswork! thank you gnoo for your ideas !!
[18:57:39] <boON> 'max_downloads': '2,
[18:57:39] <boON> accepted easy solution
[18:57:39] <boON> think that will work good from me
[18:57:39] <boON> thanks and massive karmapoints for you :)
