[00:50:33] <JordiGH> But whenever I was using it, I felt like people would look at me funny and say, "why not just use rsync"?
[00:50:48] <technomancy> because rsync isn't written in OCaml !!
[00:50:51] <JordiGH> 'Cause I can't figure out the difference between 'foo' and 'foo/' that's why.
[00:51:04] <technomancy> lmao yeah that is incredibly stupid rsync behavior

[00:51:39] <companion_cube> the / is useful, just a bit tricky

[07:41:58] <pnoud> They changed menus and the UI drastically.

[07:42:41] <cb> they look a little different but are functionally identical
[07:42:45] <pnoud> Menu options have moved from where they have been for 15 years
[07:42:50] <pnoud> And for what benfit
[07:42:57] <cb> i dont know what menu options changed, can you provide an example?

[07:43:08] <cb> i rarely check the menu bar but almost everything is as i remember it from firefox 2 in 2007
[07:43:13] <pnoud> Right click on a tab, the description and order is different.
[07:43:21] <ignaloidas> it just looks slightly different, at least they didn't reorganize everything
[07:43:25] <cb> looks about the same to me?
[07:43:31] <pnoud> They _did_ reorganize things?
[07:43:32] <ignaloidas> right click options got better IMO
[07:43:46] <pnoud> I can't reconcile your last two comments
[07:44:08] <cb> i seriously can't notice any changes
[07:44:18] <ignaloidas> they did not reorganize everything. They did reorganize some things that make sense
[07:44:22] <pnoud> Are you on Firefox 89?
[07:44:34] <cb> i've got 89 on one system and 9x on the other
[07:44:36] <ignaloidas> I'm on 91
[07:45:00] <pnoud> I'm on 91 at home and 89 at work.

[07:45:30] <cb> menu options look identical here
[07:46:07] <pnoud> Ok so let me ask this way.  Would oyou be disappointed if Mozilla _didn't_ change the menus and UI?
[07:46:09] <cb> i just updated to 91 on the mac and it's still the same
[07:46:14] <ignaloidas> right click options sligtly changed for the better
[07:46:27] <pnoud> I disagree that change can be better.
[07:46:29] <cb> i personally don't care, if it improves things, i'm for it
[07:46:39] <pnoud> I don't see how change improves anything in a tool
[07:46:50] <ignaloidas> pnoud, yes, of course, let's still use linux 2.8
[07:46:58] <pnoud> Reopening multiple windows is still borken.  If they changed that it would be an improvement.
[07:47:07] <cb> i.e. some shit is just a clusterfuck of organization so changing it would break people who rote memorized it, but benefit everyone else who hasn't internalized having walk across the house to find a fglass of water
[07:47:07] <bsandro> some changes feel like they've been made just for the sake of it
[07:47:19] <cb> bsandro: i mean they haev to employ devs somehow
[07:47:38] <bsandro> like renaming the master password to primary password, wow that was world-changing
[07:47:43] <ignaloidas> you may feel that way, but they do have metrics
[07:47:43] <pnoud> This isn't devs.  This is _designers_.
[07:47:52] <bsandro> or moving "passwords" to the different menu entirely just because
[07:47:59] <ignaloidas> minor improvements is how things are polished
[07:48:18] <pnoud> I disagree.  This is disruptice change for the sake of change.  Nothing is materially better.
[07:48:20] <ignaloidas> you don't get good without things that for some seem like useless changes
[07:48:40] <pnoud> You don't get good going in circles either.
[07:48:52] <bsandro> i fail to see how master->primary change is an improvement
[07:49:10] <pnoud> I don't see _any_ improvement.
[07:49:20] <ignaloidas> if it got slightly better for 90% of users and maybe 1% of users got somewhat annoyed, it's not a bad improvement for most
[07:49:32] <pnoud> Oh please.
[07:49:36] <ignaloidas> bsandro, same as git's master -> main
[07:49:44] <bsandro> or why the new "compact" style is still a giant one
[07:49:52] <bsandro> ignaloidas: same pointless thing aye
[07:50:05] <pnoud> ignaloidas: do you believe Quantum was an improvement for 90% of users?  And that their requirements changed fundamentally in the last two years?

[07:51:10] <pnoud> If changed benefit "90%" of people then why does UI change completely every two years?
[07:51:19] <bsandro> it doesn't have to invoke "feeling"
[07:51:25] <bsandro> it has to be as transparent as it can be
[07:51:28] <ignaloidas> and a slight change of some ordering to make it more ergonomic
[07:51:42] <pnoud> It's not more ergonomic because now I have to think about what changed.
[07:51:50] <ignaloidas> believe me, I don't like constant refreshes either
[07:51:56] <pnoud> You had me fooled.
[07:52:07] <ignaloidas> but as far as refreshes go, this one is a very transparent one
[07:52:12] <pnoud> Wrong.
[07:52:44] <ignaloidas> how is it different?
[07:52:51] <ignaloidas> what changed drastically?
[07:52:56] <pnoud> I can't even tell if youa re serious.
[07:52:58] <ignaloidas> design language?
[07:53:15] <bsandro> they stole my screen pixels
[07:53:38] <pnoud> ^
[07:53:48] <ignaloidas> bsandro, what? the themes are basically the same size as previous ones
[07:53:58] <pnoud> rofl
[07:54:05] <pnoud> Ok now I'm convinced you are trolling
[07:54:21] <ignaloidas> do I need to find screenshots from the same machine to measure the pixels?
[07:54:55] <bsandro> ignaloidas: no it is not :C menu items take much more space now and compact styled tabs are not compact at all
[07:55:47] <bsandro> i can live with menus reshuffle if they can back it up with some ergonomics metrics or whatever, okay
[07:56:01] <bsandro> but why they steal my screen real estate I fail to understand
[07:56:17] <ignaloidas> 10px higher toolbar
[07:56:25] <ignaloidas> is this what you are crying about?
[07:56:34] <ignaloidas> god, why even care about that
[07:56:44] <bsandro> I wouldn't use the word "crying"
[07:56:46] <pnoud> Because it's a waste of space and makes using the browser worse?
[07:56:47] <ignaloidas> it's barely a line of text
[07:56:58] <pnoud> Right.  I could have another line of information on my screen.
[07:57:18] <ignaloidas> I fail to see how making tabs more clickable makes a browser worse
[07:57:33] <bsandro> it was already perfectly clickable before
[07:57:34] <pnoud> They aren't more clickable.  They just have wastd space around them.
[07:57:45] <bsandro> now it is "touchable" but fake
[07:57:53] <pnoud> I don't have a touchscreen.
[07:58:02] <bsandro> me neither. barely anyone has
[07:58:18] <bsandro> and those who have certainly don't use it to switch tabs
[07:58:44] <bsandro> mouse is a precise control instrument and that's what those interfaces are aimed for, you can't have both

[07:58:55] <pnoud> I actually work for a living.  I use my browser all day.  I often have multiple windows open, and multiple applications.  A couple browser windows, a shell or two, an IDE, etc.  Even with my 38" widescreen real estate matters, especially in BigSur.
[07:59:04] <bsandro> if they want to make touch-friendly stuff it should be a complete revamp for different layout altogether
[07:59:25] <cb> i also spend all day in a browser, but i literally have not noticed these changes or just "eh who cares"
[07:59:28] <pnoud> This makes my work harder and offers me zero benefit.  The things that _are_ a problem in Firefox continue to not get fixed.
[07:59:33] <cb> and i am good at noticing things
[07:59:33] <bsandro> like windows ce stuff was made for clicks but ppl tried to use it for touch and that's how it failed
[07:59:47] <ignaloidas> touchscreens had 10% market share in laptops in 2013
[07:59:49] <bsandro> no amount of screen space substituted it
[07:59:57] <ignaloidas> and the marketshare has only been growing
[08:00:03] <bsandro> ignaloidas: read above
[08:00:20] <bsandro> you can't just make clicks-based interface bigger and pretend it is touch-friendly now
[08:00:31] <bsandro> it is still shit for touch and just becomes shit for clicks
[08:00:41] <pnoud> How hard is it to just make a touch version?  They already maintain multiple layouts.  So just have a compact one for sane people like me and a touch version for the filthy masses.
[08:00:55] <ignaloidas> bsandro, have you tried to use a laptop with a touchscreen over the last 5 years? because it doesn't seem si
[08:01:01] <ignaloidas> *so
[08:01:02] <pnoud> and when I say masses I mean 10% of laptops
[08:01:14] <pnoud> Why would I do that?  I sit at a desk all day.
[08:01:25] <pnoud> They don't make 38" laptops.
[08:01:31] <bsandro> ignaloidas: no, why would I use a laptop with a touchscreen, it has a keyboard and a touchpad
[08:01:52] <pnoud> touchscreens are a huge compromise for small devices.
[08:01:52] <bsandro> i have an ipad and touch works there just fine with native interfaces
[08:02:02] <ignaloidas> well, then you can't talk shit about how it doesn't work for touchscreens
[08:02:22] <ignaloidas> because, surprise surprise, it does
[08:02:24] <bsandro> ipad browsers interface is completely different from desktop
[08:02:26] <pnoud> Please, install Firefox 91 with Proton on your iPad.  I'll wait.
[08:02:47] <bsandro> mobile firefox is also completely different from desktop one
[08:02:48] <ignaloidas> ipad interface is different because it has 3 times less screen real estate
[08:03:09] <bsandro> because no one in their sane mind would use desktop menus as touch ones, that's just a marketing gimmick
[08:03:13] <pnoud> ignaloidas: ok so we agree?

[08:04:08] <pnoud> ignaloidas: funny, I was thinking you had that problem.
[08:04:16] <bsandro> ^ this
[08:04:31] <bsandro> touchscreen on laptop is an addition, not main input method
[08:04:55] <bsandro> otherwise it wouldn't have that decrepit pointing device attached
[08:04:56] <pnoud> If an iPad and a laptop are different things why does a laptop need a touch UI?  Further, what about workstations for people who... work?
[08:05:04] <ignaloidas> bsandro, you have not used a laptop with a touchscreen, stop talking shit you don't know
[08:05:23] <ignaloidas> touch is useful for some things
[08:05:28] <bsandro> ignaloidas: i can make an educated guess
[08:05:28] <pnoud> I also haven't used a lpatop with eye stabber 9000
[08:05:31] <pnoud> Because why would I do that.
[08:05:54] <ignaloidas> e.g. quickly accessing things that could be annoying to access with a touchpad
[08:05:59] <ignaloidas> e.g. browser tabs
[08:06:21] <bsandro> i fail to see how accessing browser tabs is annoying with a touchpad
[08:06:28] <ignaloidas> it
[08:06:37] <bsandro> heck, i'm on desktop PC now and I still use touchpad
[08:07:04] <ignaloidas>  takes time to move the cursor, for some people more time than just lifting your hand and just touching

[08:07:49] <pnoud> I can move my cursor from one side to the other with a 6" motion
[08:08:12] <bsandro> for any sane person working with a computer it is a much more pain to actually move a hand from primary input device
[08:08:17] <ignaloidas> so stop talking like you know everything about laptops and use them everyday then pnoud
[08:08:25] <ignaloidas> because shit is not equivalent
[08:08:48] <pnoud> haha I am loving the idea that ignaloidas had massive shoulders and huge biceps to maintain the stamina necessary to interact with a touch screen for more than about 30 seconds.
[08:08:53] <bsandro> i'm using ipad as an extended display for macbook
[08:09:11] <bsandro> using touch there is not handy at all
[08:09:27] <bsandro> i actually have to move my hands for that and that's not ergonomic
[08:09:37] <ignaloidas> if you are so hardcore, just edit the damn user.css and make it as tiny as you wish
[08:10:03] <ignaloidas> god, if you dislike it so much, you can just compile your own version after all
[08:10:24] <bsandro> seems like you're out of arguments
[08:10:25] <pnoud> very ergonomic
[08:10:36] <pnoud> firefox has the most ergonomic user compilation
[08:10:53] <pnoud> you can rebuild the whole browser with only 9000 taps
[08:11:28] <bsandro> should i use a screen keyboard on the touchscreen laptop
[08:11:34] <ignaloidas> but whining that they changed something for others that use hardware that you clearly don't know about seems to be just about at your limits of contribution
[08:11:35] <bsandro> to keep things ergonomic and nearby
[08:11:57] <pnoud> ignaloidas: by your own argument they broke 90% of users for 10% of users.
[08:12:07] <bsandro> ignaloidas: what is the current percentage of screens on market that support touch? including desktops
[08:12:21] <ignaloidas> bsandro, you don't like touchscreens. and that's ok. but you don't need to mock people who use them
[08:12:41] <pnoud> if someone was primarily usng a touchscreen at work I would absolutely mock them
[08:12:51] <ignaloidas> bsandro, sadly, I can't tell you because I can't be bothered to buy a stupid industry report for this shit

[08:13:36] <pnoud> I already learned
[08:13:37] <ignaloidas> pnoud, and out you go with your smug attitude then, if you can
[08:13:47] <ignaloidas> 't empathize, you can't complain either
[08:14:02] <pnoud> lol smug attitude.  sorry about the hot take of "people learn how to use tools then use them"
[08:14:17] <pnoud> clearly i am a maniac
[08:14:26] <ignaloidas> if you can't learn all the time, that's the fate you deserve
[08:14:34] <bsandro> ignaloidas: i never said i dislike touchscreens, i (like many others) use them on daily basis on smartphone and tablet
[08:14:35] <ignaloidas> the more you use the tool, the more you learn about it
[08:14:36] <pnoud> rofl
[08:14:57] <pnoud> maybe i want to learn things that are useful instead of basic literacy like navigating a desktop environment.
[08:15:14] <ignaloidas> I learned how Linux 2.8 works, why are they developing new interfaces
[08:15:26] <ignaloidas> I learned the tool, and just want to use it
[08:15:35] <pnoud> i love that you keep bringing that up when the first rule of linux is "don't break userspace"
[08:15:52] <bsandro> ignaloidas: but even with "huge growth" you can't tell me that touchscreens are available in a majority of desktop+laptop computers?
[08:16:13] <ignaloidas> and if I develop kernel drivers for a manufacturer? why should it be any different?
[08:16:19] <pnoud> and even if they WERE why would I make the compromises to use a touch UI?
[08:16:32] <ignaloidas> shit changes, and not always for you. deal with it
[08:16:37] <pnoud> there's zero benefit to me

[08:16:42] <pnoud> nah man
[08:17:03] <manicennui> Yeah, who actually wants to use touch?
[08:17:11] <manicennui> We use it on phones because it works with the small form factor.
[08:17:31] <bsandro> so they introduce changes that _might_ be useful for a 0% of desktop users and maybe 10% of laptop users and you spitting noncense in favor of that? ignaloidas
[08:17:31] <pnoud> Even on a phone I kinda miss my old feature phone with the pop out tactile keyboard
[08:17:32] <ignaloidas> those who actually enjoy moving their hands away from their keyboard?
[08:17:38] <manicennui> I feel like Windows users still want it because trackpads on Windows laptops are ass.
[08:18:05] <ignaloidas> I still fail to see how that is bad bsandro
[08:18:14] <pnoud> i wish ignaloidas would move their hands away from their keyboard tbh
[08:18:42] <ignaloidas> if you think that 10 extra pixels is so bad, I don't know what to say
[08:18:48] <bsandro> ignaloidas: do you use mouse with your computer? are you a right-handed person?
[08:18:50] <pnoud> and yet you keep saying things

[08:45:26] <rtpg> Does anyone have a good solution for if I want to make a script that essentially spawns two programs, where I want to ... somehow... allow access to stdin/stdout/stderr to both? Like the functional equivalent of opening two tabs in your terminal emulator and having two programs running side-by-side?
[08:46:00] <meff[m]> Do you want to slurp stdout/stderr as the programs execute?
[08:46:19] <pnoud> I normally just output each process to a file.
[08:46:30] <pnoud> but yeah, meff[m] asks a good question
[08:46:50] <rtpg> not doing anything, just want it to be visible to the user (these are basically filewatch/devserver processes)
[08:47:18] <meff[m]> You should be able to spawn them in a shell just fine and their stdouts will be hooked up to the PTY stdout

[08:50:03] <rtpg> yeah stdout "just works", the one I wasn't so sure about was stdin though
[08:50:14] <rtpg> like choosing to direct output to one side or another...
[08:50:20] <pnoud> rtpg: IDK what you are trying to achieve exactly but I have some operations scripts I run frequently that take hours/days to complete.  I might be running 5-10 of them at once.  So they all just output to a logfile and get sent to the background and disowned
[08:50:31] <pnoud> then I just tail the logs to see what's going on
[08:50:43] <pnoud> not really an answer to your question but maybe it works?
[08:51:02] <pnoud> each process gets its own logifle
[08:51:51] <rtpg> right, like how you would run "in production". I think that's a great thing if you have an interface for it as well (like papertrail). Part of this is that this is also for people who are not so technically literate/unix-able (so not so comfortable with "just tail the log files")
[08:52:34] <rtpg> maybe the stdin thing is silly. I could just, say, have a flag like "stdin will go to this process" (allowing for using stuff like a debugger without messing with a remote debugger), and work from that.
[08:52:58] <pnoud> So your users know about stdout and stdin but not tail?
[08:53:10] <pnoud> are your users all in week 5 of cs 101?
[08:53:13] <pnoud> <_<
[08:53:36] <meff[m]> rtpg: like choosing which process to send stdin to?
[08:53:43] <rtpg> yeah
[08:53:49] <pnoud> can you use named pipes for this?
[08:54:04] <rtpg> oh, maybe....
[08:54:11] <pnoud> give each process an input and output pipe in place of stdin/stdout?
[08:54:19] <meff[m]> Personally I'd just use Python Popen

[08:56:08] <technomancy> Python on Popen; is that the new Ruby on Rails competitor?
[08:56:20] <pnoud> meff[m]: yeah I don't fully understand rtpg's limitations.  Like how do users interact with these processes?  Are they in the shell but mostly clueless?
[08:56:50] <meff[m]> Python on Pails!
[08:57:04] <meff[m]> Yeah not sure about the usecase here, but stdin might be coming from elsewhere
[08:57:07] <pnoud> Pails of Pythons
[08:57:30] *** Joins: heichblatt (~hke@user/heichblatt)
[08:57:48] <rtpg> The context is basically people like designers, where you can tell them "type exactly this in the terminal" and they can theoretically look at logfiles but it will take them longer than if you just did the hacky thing of dumping all the output in one place
[08:58:18] <pnoud> fire all your designers?
[08:58:19] <pnoud> <_<
[08:58:22] <rtpg> and the stdin stuff is more like... some people on the team know about stuff like pdb, are retiscient about using remote debugging stuff, and just want to put stuff directly in stdin sometimes (like when you do pytest --pdb)
[08:58:30] <pnoud> quick can them before they release another firefox!
[08:58:35] <pnoud> ok, I'll stop now.
[08:59:11] <pnoud> rtpg: is it reasonable to just tell them to go nuts and figure it out? because that's pretty much the best way to learn IMHO
[08:59:15] <pnoud> assuming they cant hurt themselves
[08:59:20] <rtpg> I mean my belief is that this stuff is always harder than it should be, but I was just checking if there wasn't like an existing "obvious" tool that I was just missing. Every day somebody is born that doesn't even know about shell indirection
[08:59:46] <pnoud> something something todays 10,000
[09:00:03] <rtpg> the stdin stuff is probably a bit irrelevant to the "not good at shell" crowd anyways.... so I could say that that stdin-switching is for people who at least get shell flags
[09:00:16] *** Quits: plsm (~plsm@user/plsm) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[09:01:17] <rtpg> I'm still shocked at how like... some designers on the team use sourcetree for git and even that, simple workflows like "updating from upstream" is error-prone. I don't get how people get work done (except by separating out the design people from the implementors, I guess)
[09:04:31] <pnoud> I'm not sure work does get done in a lot of places.
[09:04:40] <pnoud> I have been around long enough to see the same thing get built like five times
[09:04:59] <pnoud> It's the circle of life (promos)
[09:05:17] <rtpg> I try to be pretty open about this stuff and not too judgy (like yeah I'm fine with people not being able to manipulate the git CLI yet being able to produce good python code, it's not the same skillset)
[09:05:28] <rtpg> but sometimes it is just dysfunction
[09:05:33] <pnoud> yeah
[09:07:25] <pnoud> we are dealing with something similar.  we have partners who are... not technical.  But we need data from them.  So we have all these data validation rules and "fixes"
[09:07:55] <pnoud> but it's a constant debate about how far we let them break things before we just say hey, seriously, stop randomly picking character encodings.  if it isnt utf8 we are throwing it away
[09:08:47] <pnoud> on one hand we need their data, on the other they don't have the technical capability to create csv files.
[09:09:26] <rtpg> right. Sometimes the thing is to just build out the tool. I've found also that just throwing out the process/doing something upstream works (like "ok just give us the raw things and we'll figure it out")
[09:09:34] <rtpg> but it's frustrating and no single rule solves all of it irght
[09:09:39] <pnoud> right
[09:09:46] <pnoud> and like, the problem is human, not technical
[09:10:09] <pnoud> the problem is they are humans who literally don't think "hey maybe we should write this down" and it's kinda hard to fix thaaT with java.
[09:11:22] <pnoud> in the same way that the shell already does everything your users need.  the tool already exists, they just have to know how to swing it

[09:24:51] <rtpg> I really believe that if someone made a terminal emulator that like.... explicitly marked spaces (to show how argument splitting will happen) and added a "put a mouse over this command to see the help text"/"this argument will go to this parameter" it would help a lot of people

[20:15:07] <companion_cube> there's no money there, it's a lot of work to ask for, no?
[20:15:11] <pushcx> kline: I gotta be a bit paranoid on it.
[20:15:31] <kline> companion_cube, bants though
[20:15:34] <kline> pushcx, best of luck
[20:15:57] <riv> yes its work but it's useful to validate your claims
[20:17:07] <kline> riv, i dont think theres anything here that actually needs validating, every bit has prior art
[20:17:18] <riv> the timing attack
[20:17:52] <kline> yes, prior art exists
[20:17:53] <c355e3b> all of our infra is checked into github and public if anyone wants to try to spin it up
[20:18:04] <c355e3b> iirc you used to be able to do it with Vagrant quite quikcly
[20:18:10] <kline> its possible, i just dont think its very practical
[20:18:15] <kline> but the author says the same

[20:19:03] <kline> i still think there are issues with the article, but i dont think "bruh did you actually do it" is the main issue, because theres nothing here that is a surprising or outlandish claim
[20:19:10] <kline> c355e3b, uh, sure
[20:19:19] <epilys> the author quotes the IRA btw, "This is a bit silly when contrasted with the usual information security wisdom; n.b. “Defenders have to be right 100% of the time, attackers only have to be right once.”"
[20:19:21] <kline> but you can trivially unquiet yourself
[20:19:38] <c355e3b> Just wanted to make sure before I do something stupid
[20:19:56] <kline> epilys, right but thats not really much different from harris, "the bomber will always get through"
[20:20:06] <companion_cube> epilys: it's a good quote

[20:21:46] <kline> riv, like i said, it seems really unusual to "yeah we're just going to release cause the upstream ignored our emails" but then in narrative talk about how responsive etc the upstream has been
[20:22:06] <riv> thats normal in security
[20:22:23] <companion_cube> I hope pushcx has a bounty program
[20:22:43] <kline> to release after end of contact? yes. but its not normal to say "yes they were very responsive" and also say "but they ignored my emails and followups"

[20:35:21] <riv> I think it's important to prove that a vulnerability can be exploited (not just theory) because you are causing people significant work to fix the problem, and without a poc it's hard to regression test a fix
[20:35:45] <cb> one month seems also a little aggressive timeline wise

[21:19:54] <indigo> I wonder if adding a random sleep to the password reset query can alleviate timing attacks

[21:24:31] <epilys> frameworks usually have a constant time comparison function for this

[21:26:02] <mockturtle> [ secrets — Generate secure random numbers for managing secrets — Python 3.9.6 documentation ] - docs.python.org
[21:26:13] <indigo> Right, but this is a SQL where statement, so either you dump all the tokens for everyone and compare in the framework… or maybe mysql has a constant time where?
[21:26:26] <indigo> Soatok probably knows best tbh
[21:26:55] <epilys> you can register your own comparison function :D
[21:27:48] <companion_cube> I'm still baffled timing attacks can be a thing
[21:28:08] <companion_cube> isn't there an ~infinite amount of noise, with OS scheduling, SQL queries, etc.?
[21:28:24] <companion_cube> the time spent actually comparing a hash must be ridiculously small in comparison?

[22:40:28] <gerikson> if anything the first novel is the hit-or-miss
[22:40:36] <gerikson> not really got the formula
[22:40:43] <gerikson> ofc HMS Surprise is the best
[22:40:59] <bkero> The first book establishes the formula, of course it hasn't been refined yet. :P
[22:41:10] <epilys> They were supposed to be best friends and literally had a duel? Come on
[22:41:15] <bkero> Aubrey is inept and a posh boy, and Maturin is also a posh boy but inept in a different way.
[22:41:24] <gerikson> I seem to remember it was a surprise hit
[22:41:29] <gerikson> and POB needed $$$
[22:41:36] <epilys> Aubrey lived most of his childhood at sea, you have to remember

[22:41:58] <gerikson> he's not posh
[22:42:47] <gerikson> and Maturin has had an eclectic education
[22:42:48] <epilys> He must always choose the lesser of two weevils
[22:42:54] <gerikson> so true
[22:43:26] <epilys> My favourite Aubrey/Maturin pun was the dog watch one
[22:43:35] <gerikson> lol
[22:43:41] <epilys> "dog watch" the seamen called a watch short in duration
[22:44:02] <epilys> and someone asks "why is it called a dog watch? what's the canine connection?" and maturin replies "why because they are curtailed of course"
