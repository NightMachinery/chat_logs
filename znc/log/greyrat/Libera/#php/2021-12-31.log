[00:15:58] <judah> Hey, thats pretty nifty. I wonder if that example is actually how its supposed to be used, and if so how it works behind the scenes
[00:16:38] <AllenJB> Looking at the code I think it's abusing debug_get_backtrace to inspect how it was called. Don't do that.
[00:16:56] <da_wunder> what is your thoughs about this - https://peakd.com/hive-168588/@crell/aoc2021-review ?
[00:17:15] <AllenJB> It's terrible UX anyway IMO. How is anyone who doesn't know the library supposed to understand what's going on?
[00:18:23] <Albright> I agree. Especially since @ and ! already have other meanings at the beginning of function calls like that
[00:19:02] <__adrian> bluntly "debug" libraries are just a tangent in the wrong direction anyway
[00:19:03] <anyone> AllenJB: I don't!
[00:19:17] <__adrian> especially those that focus on some fancy way of displaying the output
[00:20:13] <da_wunder> there is nothing wrong with displaying stuff fancy way
[00:20:51] <da_wunder> and really have you ever needed to make site to cover WCAG 2.1 spec?
[00:21:06] <Albright> The latest macOS release broke my preferred GDB client (which was very old) so I've been relying a bit too much on var dumping recently, I'm ashamed to say
[00:21:42] <__adrian> what's WCAG have to do with it?
[00:22:08] <da_wunder> that fancy output need to cover those rules too
[00:22:48] <da_wunder> and "output" for me is shell, web page, email, etc
[00:28:03] <Albright> Ah, that Hive thing is a fork of Steem. Interesting.

[00:36:03] <da_wunder> the point was to ask your opinions about functional programming, not blockchain stuff

[01:05:10] <__adrian> a built-in ::new() (or more likely, __new()) method would be great.
[01:05:20] <impliednude> https://codebeautify.org/jsonviewer/cb35829a - how can I pick up customer_address and foreach contacts. all the while add the entityid and companyname
[01:06:32] <__adrian> impliednude: are you asking how to access the items?
[01:06:39] <Albright> "customer_addresss" and "AddresLabel", oof
[01:06:56] <__adrian> heh lol
[01:07:16] <impliednude> Albright> I blame netsuite
[01:08:15] <Albright> Anyway, yes, what in particular are you asking for?
[01:08:30] <Albright> Are you at least at the point of getting an object from json_decode()?
[01:08:55] <da_wunder> ^
[01:09:08] <da_wunder> and if not then you're not handling json at all
[01:09:13] <impliednude> ...
[01:09:16] <impliednude> I
[01:09:27] <impliednude> can and know how to do simple json objects.
[01:09:45] <__adrian> one of the projects i work on has legacy functions  parseMagnetoInput()  and  getDependants()
[01:10:44] <__adrian> they're used in a lot of places and everyone's just sort of resigned to the fact that there's no reason to risk fixing them
[01:11:01] <da_wunder> impliednude: so what is your actual issue then?
[01:11:15] <impliednude> I just dont know how to create a contact loop where it traverses the address with the next and next as single outputs. aka contacts name, then address 1 outputed, then go through again with contacts name, then address two, etc..
[01:11:19] <Albright> function parseMagentoInput() { return parseMagnetoInput(); }
[01:11:41] <__adrian> "json objects"  note there's no such thing. json is a string format. objects (or more sensibly, arrays) are what you get when you decode them.
[01:13:01] <__adrian> impliednude> outputted  // so you're just printing info? or do you mean "return" or collect?
[01:13:02] <Albright> impliednude: So are you saying the first "contacts" should correspond with the first "customer_addresss" and so on?
[01:13:20] <impliednude> Albright> no, first contact should have output of each address.
[01:13:21] <da_wunder> impliednude: sorry don't understand what you're looking for, you have that json string - you could convert that to array or stdclass and then just process that as you like - I don't understand what kind of output you want of that
[01:13:22] <__adrian> i find that ^ unlikely
[01:13:43] <impliednude> over and over, then onto the next contact with each address, etc..
[01:13:59] <__adrian> so every contact would list every address?
[01:14:12] <impliednude> yes, with its own foreach output.
[01:14:16] <Albright> impliednude: `foreach ($object->contacts as $contact) { foreach ($objects->customer_addresss as $addy) { // do stuff } }` maybe?
[01:14:29] <da_wunder> what is the relation between contact and customer_address ?
[01:14:30] <impliednude> alrighty.
[01:14:31] <__adrian> since you'll be reusing them every time, get the addresses first.
[01:14:36] <__adrian> then loop over the contacts.

[04:48:16] <Blondie101010> not sure why there's no quotes in that paste
[04:48:20] <__adrian> is [3] an array? or a csv?

[04:48:40] <__adrian> it should be an array  ;)
[04:48:59] <ham5> 3d point, coordinates, why?
[04:49:02] <Blondie101010> and you also need to define what to do with the multiple matches
[04:49:06] <__adrian> ^
[04:49:35] <__adrian> because a string is one value. an array has multiple values. your data matches the latter.

[04:51:06] <ham5> yes:)
[04:51:32] <__adrian> blondie's question is "what result do you want if more than one array matches?"
[04:51:49] <__adrian> e.g., first? last? error?
[04:51:54] <Blondie101010> well I'm also interested on how "59882 name     (1298.4, 0.0, 844.7)  (0.0, 0.0, 0.0)" should be parsed
[04:52:29] <__adrian> i imagine that's a pre-formatted summary
[04:52:31] <ham5> the number is unique, there will not be duplicate, [0] is not used just part of the preg_match_all
[04:52:42] <__adrian> ah
[04:53:06] <Blondie101010> then why is your limited example holding the same number you're searching twice?
[04:53:33] <__adrian> so, question. if you want to look up by [1], and [1] is always unique, why not index your array?
[04:53:48] <Blondie101010> the more I look at that paste, and the more I'm convinced it's just bad
[04:53:59] <__adrian> twice?  // assuming they're searching the list (top level array) and the nested array is an example of a single item
[04:54:01] <Blondie101010> why would all records be formatted differently?
[04:54:35] <Blondie101010> ohhh, so it's preparsed
[04:54:42] <ham5> index it why or how that just seems like an extra step,
[04:54:44] <__adrian> ham5: are you going to be searching this list more than once?
[04:55:03] <Blondie101010> ham5:  right now you have no valid data
[04:55:16] <Blondie101010> define what you need, and implement it
[04:55:27] <Blondie101010> that paste is junk
[04:55:29] <ham5> yes, I would need to find multiple [1]'s and get the cords
[04:55:36] <__adrian> then index the list
[04:55:48] <__adrian> it'll let you skip the loop entirely
[04:55:52] <Blondie101010> if that's your raw input data, then interpret it better
[04:55:56] <__adrian> ^ this too
[04:55:56] <ham5> well I got my answer 'loop, check [1], if it matches return [3]'
[04:56:08] <Blondie101010> sure
[04:56:10] <__adrian> yes, but i'm saying that, now that i know the context, my answer is bad.
[04:56:28] <__adrian> don't do that; it's foolishly wasteful.
[04:56:46] <ham5> I thought so, so I would need to 'index' it for it to be more useful?
[04:56:54] <Blondie101010> $arr[$key] = $value;
[04:57:02] <Blondie101010> then you can get it direclty
[04:57:06] <__adrian> index the list. if the _only_ bit you care about is the coords, then only keep that info.
[04:57:12] <__adrian> what blondie said ^
[04:57:54] <ham5> thanks, ill look into this indexing stuff
[04:58:13] <Blondie101010> there's nothing to look into, other than your use case and data
[04:58:23] <__adrian> i'd wonder if preg_match_all is the best way to parse your initial data, so you might consider that too
[04:58:34] <__adrian> but if you're stuck with that approach, then array_column()

[10:15:46] <Blondie101010> troubleshoot to find why
[10:15:56] <setuid> It quite literally is: $parsearray[] = $sitecontents;
[10:16:07] <Blondie101010> var_dump() it to see what it holds
[10:16:40] <Blondie101010> ok, so make a 5 line demo on https://3v4l.org/
[10:16:57] <Blondie101010> it has all php versions
[10:17:27] <Blondie101010> or you could instead look for the real problem
[10:17:54] <Blondie101010> though the exercise in pinpointing what is or is not the problem is good in itself
[10:18:14] <Blondie101010> but var_dump() now!

[10:22:24] <Blondie101010> 8.0.0	Passing the separator after the array is no longer supported.
[10:22:25] <tirnanog> the more you know. php used to accept a "legacy" signature of implode(array $array, string $separator): string. dang.
[10:22:44] <Blondie101010> interesting
[10:23:35] <Blondie101010> so screw BC
[10:24:23] <tirnanog> basically. though it begets the question of how they ever got themselves into the situation where there are two signatures that are the exact inverse of one another to begin with. that's really bad.
[10:24:34] <setuid> tirnanog: interesting... that unblocked that issue, but now I've hit another (again, working in 7.3, not in 8.0).. apparently each() is no longer supported?

[18:48:06] <AllenJB> arash: You need to copy one of those files to "php.ini" (they are suggested configs)
[18:48:35] <novns> and in windows you may need to add .dll to extensions
[18:48:41] <AllenJB> Also check that the opeenssl extension actually exists in the exts/ folder

[18:52:15] <AllenJB> Did you copy your php.ini from a previous version? If so you may need to update paths in the php.ini to point to the correct folder (I believe in this case you want to modify one called something like "extension_dir")

[21:17:39] <zzz> have i been hacked? i found this on top an index.php: https://paste.jrvieira.com/jemphp
[21:19:03] <Stanley> zzz: if you find anything and you didn't put it there then the answer is likely "yes"
[21:19:38] <zzz> this is a wordpress instalation that doesnt belong to me
[21:20:01] <zzz> they are asking me for help
[21:20:22] <zzz> i have no idea what that php does
[21:21:36] <biberu> you'll have to decode it step by step to find out, but you'll also have to figure out how it got there in the first place
[21:21:49] <Blondie101010> zzz:  then they asked the wrong person
[21:21:54] <Nekomander> zzz, that's the point. You're not suppose to know. It allows them to do whatever they want with the website/server basically, the code is intentionally obfuscated to conceal how they do it and so on.
[21:23:03] <biberu> zzz: note that you can't just remove it, that'll leave the original vulnerability in place, and possibly others that attackers could have created after gaining access to the server
[21:24:57] <biberu> clarifying: ofc you have to remove it, but *only* doing that is probably not enough
[21:25:18] <Blondie101010> so you have 2 major things to do:  a) backup the current installation somewhere you can investigate the initial intrusion; b) restore your good backup to get things back to normal and ready for a patch
[21:25:43] <Blondie101010> removing lines from source code is NOT part of any decent solution!!!
[21:26:19] <biberu> indeed, use backups
[21:26:19] <Blondie101010> though I can feel that they don't have any backups...
[21:26:46] <anomander> zzz: install a wordpress plugin ala wordfence which can scan the whole codebase comparing hashes of files to known versions. its still not guaranteed to find everything though. your best bet is to restore from backups.
[21:26:55] <Blondie101010> if you accept this assignment, you'll be responsible for whatever happens from now on
[21:26:58] <Nekomander> zzz, MAYBE your task is to learn how it got there in the first place. When you figure out how they managed to put that code there in the first place, you can then close the security hole, whatever this one weird trick they've used to get that code there.
[21:27:07] <Blondie101010> are you skilled enough to take that risk?
[21:27:08] <Nekomander> Script kiddies hates them!
[21:27:14] <biberu> those backups probably contain the original vulnerability too, which you should find
[21:27:47] <Stanley> It's pretty easy to decode
[21:28:05] <Stanley>  I've been doing it for fun
[21:28:05] <Stanley> lol
[21:28:13] <Blondie101010> that will not tell anyone how the intrusion took place
[21:28:25] <Stanley> yeah no
[21:28:34] <Stanley> and what it does is pretty pointless because that parts irrelevant
[21:28:40] <Blondie101010> does it point to a russian server?
[21:28:43] <Stanley> you just need it removed and to make sure it doesn't come back
[21:28:46] <Stanley> not sure yet haven't got that far
[21:28:53] <zzz> i'm aware of it, thank you. i'm looking through the logs and starting to work on finding out what's going on. i thought it would not be unproductive to come here while i wait for the preemptive backup to finish and ask about this suspicious lines of php.
[21:29:00] <Stanley> so far the first bunch is just assigning php function names to variables
[21:29:22] <Nekomander> Basically: Backup everything. Nuke the server. Backup the Backup. Clean a copy of the backup. Then fresh install wordpress and import the cleaned backup (clean of infection/backdoors, etc.) - Consider uninstalling all plugins.
[21:29:24] <Blondie101010> zzz:  is the timestamp for the file you pasted recent?
[21:29:55] <biberu> Nekomander: that'll still likely contain the original vulnerability
[21:30:12] <Blondie101010> yes, but it's still necessary
[21:30:15] <Nekomander> They would have to install new version of wordpress.
[21:30:16] <zzz> i've been a web developer for quite some time now, i'm comfortable with "the risk". i don't know a thing about wordpress though and i'ts been ~15 years since i touched a line of php
[21:30:34] <Stanley> wordpress is no different than anything else
[21:30:35] <zzz> Blondie101010: i can do without your rude comments
[21:30:43] <biberu> this isn't a php issue as such
[21:30:48] <Blondie101010> I wish you all the worst
[21:30:52] <Stanley> someone found a vulnerability somewhere in your server and exploited it
[21:30:58] <biberu> it's a your system has been compromised issue
[21:31:34] <Stanley> it's somewhat likely it's wordpress or a wordpress plugin since most people don't keep their wordpress installation or plugins up to date
[21:31:42] <Blondie101010> I asked him the most useful and relevant question and he insulted me
[21:31:48] <Blondie101010> what a morojn
[21:31:53] *** Parts: Blondie101010 (~Blondie10@user/blondie101010) (Closing Window)
[21:32:05] <Stanley> where did he insult you?
[21:32:30] <Stanley> oh sorry missed the rude comment thing
[21:33:25] <zzz> i have just identified a keyword hack. i think it's most likely the "wordpress japanese keyword hack"
[21:34:03] <zzz> latest changes in files are 27 Dec 2021
[21:34:32] <zzz> i'm making sure there are no other suspects before proceding
[21:35:03] <biberu> did you take backups? do you have old backups?
[21:36:00] <zzz> i'm waiting on an answer but for what i can see, the only backups in the server were done manually and they are too old to be useful
[21:36:17] <zzz> which is disasterous
[21:37:20] <zzz> wordpress  and most plugins have been updated after the incident
[21:38:05] <biberu> that might make it harder to find the root cause
[21:38:21] <zzz> yes...
[21:38:33] <biberu> i'd still take a snapshot of the current state before making any changes, could be useful later
[21:38:59] <zzz> in process. eta 18hrs :/
[21:39:05] <Nekomander> Despite the plugins being updated, those could still have vulnerabilities, especially if the source of these plugins came from random third parties.
[21:39:06] <biberu> wat
[21:39:16] <biberu> 18 hours?
[21:40:35] <zzz> yes (this is not my server and i only have ftp access. on top of that i'm on a dsl connection)
[21:40:45] <Nekomander> I would rather just install plain vanilla wordpress, up-to-date, no plugins unless it's the ones wordpress authors worked on (no third parties) and then ask them to work on the theme again from scratch to ensure things are clean.
[21:41:23] <biberu> @zzz: then you can't even take a complete snapshot
[21:41:27] <Nekomander> They would need to also check file system permissions and set the sane defaults.
[21:42:05] <Nekomander> Like for example, making directories and files non-writeable.
[21:43:36] <zzz> Nekomander: that's wise. i'm trying to find out what are those sane defaults for wordpress . i'd love to avoid a fresh install but i'm not confident i can avoid it
[21:44:16] <Nekomander> https://www.internalpointers.com/post/right-folder-permission-website <-- something like this.
[21:45:08] <Nekomander> https://chmod-calculator.com/ Great permission calculator to understand what's going on. Such as "What does 750 means"
[21:46:20] <Nekomander> How to set up permissions may also depend on tthe type of web hosting service they use. (Are they using Shared hosting? Is this a VPS? Dedicated server?)
[21:46:23] <zzz> everything is 644 for what i can see
[21:46:36] <zzz> mind that i have no ssh access to this server
[21:47:08] <Nekomander> FTP client can change the permissions to the necessary values.
[21:47:19] <zzz> i don't even know what should the right user/group be
[21:47:23] <Nekomander> File and folder permissions are different.
[21:47:44] <Nekomander> And you're a web developer?
[21:47:52] <Nekomander> :P
[21:47:57] <biberu> they want you to fix this, but you don't have server access?
[21:48:30] <zzz> they don't want me to fix it, they asked me to take a look
[21:49:17] <zzz> it's a small local newspaper and they lack technical skills
[21:49:25] <zzz> i just offered to take a look
[21:49:39] <zzz> of course i want to try and fix it if i can
[21:49:50] <zzz> but that's not my job
[21:50:25] <Nekomander> zzz, well, then you can ask them to call in the big guns based on what you've seen. Obviously they got hacked. You got several answers on how to go about this. It's not your job, you can tell them to call someone else.
[21:50:35] <biberu> "this obfuscated code here, do you know who uploaded it and why?"
[21:50:50] *** Parts: anyone (~filler@a4.inai.de) ()
[21:50:52] <zzz> thanks for your help
[21:51:07] <zzz> biberu: not at all what i asked, but i get it
[21:51:09] <zzz> thanks anyway
[21:51:20] <Nekomander> There is not much else left for you to do frankly, they didn't said for you to actually fix it.
[21:51:33] <zzz> yup
[21:51:45] <Nekomander> (Though they would appreciate it, but it would be bad to do it without pay, and if anything goes wrong, they will say it's your fault, not a good position to be in)
[21:51:51] <Nekomander> With that said, have fun.
[21:52:05] <zzz> and you guys have a happy new year
[21:52:13] <biberu> happy new year :)
[21:52:21] <Nekomander> By the way, you said you work on the web, are you doing ReactJS/Vue or something? Maybe with python thrown in on the side?
[21:52:35] <Nekomander> Just curious.

[21:53:36] <Nekomander> For me, it's ReactJS + PHP these days. I haven't code very much because I am doing a lot of research on game design (i.e. How to build games that don't suck. How to keep games fair and balanced, etc.)
[21:55:25] <Nekomander> It's really hard to find good ideas, and then one suddenly get a good idea after they remove a feature. Delete stuff. Suddenly, it feels like being relieved, freed out of a cage like a happy cow jumping (they really do jump, you would never see it because they are do not seem happy in captivity.)
[21:56:11] <zzz> mostly node since 2011 until a few months ago but i recently switched to a research job where i've been writing more haskell than anything else
[21:57:29] <Nekomander> Haskell updates so friggen frequently. o_O
[21:59:46] <zzz> the last few updates to ghc were great if you agree with the direction they're going
[21:59:51] <zzz> namely 9.1 and 9.2

[22:33:24] <omegatron> maybe i'm missing something, but (though not exactly a php question) since the value of a INPUT[type=color] field is always #000000, if the user did not select a color in my form, how would I differentiate on the php side, if the user actually selected #000000 or just did not select any color? I guess I need some (hidden) extra field, which I populate via javascript with a boolean value if the user did some selection (or remove the element from
[22:33:25] <omegatron>  the form entirely)

[22:36:51] <omegatron> (and what, if the user selects a color, but later want's to reset the color field, before submitting the form) - the implementation behaviour of this particular html element is clearly broken (it should be just empty, if no selection has been made or the field was reset in whatever way)
[22:39:00] <omegatron> and not to mention, that the browser color chooser and the element itself cannot store any alpha value ..  *sigh*   -_-
