[04:15:31] <matt_mills[m]> looking at https://www.broadcom.cn/products/broadband/cable/modems/bcm3383 as well as a few other chips I've seen references to "full band capture"... does this actually mean what it is implying?
[04:28:10] <willcode4[m]> The PDF says it does direct ADC on 1GHz which then goes to one or more DDC and QAM demods.

[06:10:53] <Hash[m]> haha
[06:11:51] <Hash[m]> So I figured out my first issue with PDU to Bursts, complete ignorance... Loading the uhd loopback latency test from gr-timing_utils made that obvious

[06:13:39] <Hash[m]> I was supplying data and thinking it was going to convert that to a waveform, but in that flowgraph they supply complex values that basically build the waveform to the PDU to Bursts block
[06:14:30] <Jacob[m]12> Ah, yes. It's a pretty literal block
[06:14:35] <Jacob[m]12> Glad that example was useful
[06:14:41] <Hash[m]> I was sending 0xAA, not even 10101010 which also wouldn't work, as I need to convert the binary to a fully built signal ready to send
[06:15:06] <Hash[m]> Any pointers on how I do that? Can't seem to see any blocks that fit the bill
[06:17:12] <Jacob[m]12> There is a dubiously named "pdu_preamble" block that will add a preamble (best to do this elsewhere though), add repetition, do NRZ coding, and zero pad the ends
[06:17:14] *** Joins: Vonter_ (~Vonter@user/vonter)
[06:17:43] <Jacob[m]12> I think it also outputs floats
[06:19:12] <Jacob[m]12> Then you can use the also poorly named "gfsk_modulator" which will take an arbitrary filter coefficient vector and do pulse shaping and frequency modulation outputting complex data

[14:27:00] <willcode4[m]> jemius: The scheduler will call your `work()` function whenever it needs to. You can call it yourself (this is not how things are intended to work) if you take into account any side effect, locking, etc. that is needed. Not recommended.
[14:27:54] <jemius> willcode4[m], but I was told here that to have an FIR-filter in your own OOT-module, you should just use the native FIR-block, because it takes care of filter-state and such
[14:30:33] <willcode4[m]> jemius: That doesn't mean you call `work()`. You would either create a hier block that included the filter block, or use it along with your OOT blocks in a flowgraph.
[14:33:54] <jemius> willcode4[m], and using a filter-kernel is not an option, because it does not take care of filter state and history?
[14:36:25] <willcode4[m]> jemius: You can use `kernel::fir_filter` exactly the same way `fir_filter_blk_impl` does.

[15:16:25] <DerekKozel[m]> rodrirq: Sounds like you do need to be modifying the generated Python flowgraph. If it's small you can use the Python Snippets to put a little code in. If it's larger you reach the point where GRC becomes less useful and creating a larger application makes sense
[15:18:56] <rodrirq[m]> Hello Derek Kozel. The idea is to work with GNU Radio from an embedded computer with no interface. That's where the need of being able to modify the frequency using python comes from. Do you have an example for me to study?
[15:19:23] <DerekKozel[m]> you can use the XMLRPC blocks in GRC to control a remote flowgraph
[15:19:32] <DerekKozel[m]> including setting variables remotely
[15:20:23] <DerekKozel[m]> So if you want to remote control from another computer and both have network access that's an option.
[15:21:18] <DerekKozel[m]> If you just want to locally change the frequency programmatically then you can write your own Python to set the flowgraph's frequency variable through the set/get functions that GRC automatically generates 
[15:23:11] <rodrirq[m]> I am not even sure about which option is the one I need, to be honest
[15:23:50] <DerekKozel[m]> Here's an example that sets the frequency remotely.

[17:01:15] <DerekKozel[m]> Interesting. I wonder what that triggers
[17:02:07] <DerekKozel[m]> Can you narrow it down to a specific line in that function?
[17:02:54] <miek> it's probably because `warnings.filterwarnings("error")` upgrades the ImportWarning to an exception
[17:03:48] <DerekKozel[m]> Ah, the fallback to find_module warning?
[17:04:09] <miek> yup
[17:05:23] <DerekKozel[m]> Hmm. It'd be disappointing to backtrack and allow warnings in the main codebase. Fedora could patch it, but I guess other OSs will start hitting it unless pygobject updates very quickly
[17:10:52] <miek> yesno: could you pastebin the full backtrace?
[17:11:38] <yesno> DerekKozel[m]: I'm trying to run the launcher in the spyder

[19:40:32] <Hash[m]> <BarryDuggan[m]> "Hash: It looks like we may be..." <- Sure, happy to chat about it. I think I am getting what feels like some building blocks of knowledge together to build a burst transmitter, but still a way to go.
[19:41:37] <Jacob[m]12> You are probably closer than you think if using something that respects tx_time tags (e.g.: USRP)
[19:42:45] <Jacob[m]12> See slide 18 of the PDU_utils GRCon19 presentation
[19:43:54] <Jacob[m]12> Those three blocks are basically all you need between a data publisher and UHD sink. 
[19:44:32] <Jacob[m]12> Now getting it to talk to your devices..... 2-100x harder than a receiver :)
[19:46:21] <Hash[m]> haha
[19:55:59] <Hash[m]> <Jacob[m]12> "Those three blocks are basically..." <- When you say "data publisher" what format is that data in?
[19:57:01] <Jacob[m]12> Ill need to check if it's packed bytes or bits but it's u8 data
[19:58:12] <Hash[m]> Got it, so a string of data goes in, and it gets modulated and bobs your uncle
[19:58:50] <Jacob[m]12> It's U8 PDUs in

[20:33:22] <Jacob[m]12> Hash:  looks like pdu_preamble takes an unpacked U8 (each value is a bit, 0 or nonzero) PDU:
[20:33:22] <Jacob[m]12> https://github.com/jacobagilbert/gr-pdu_utils/blob/master/lib/pdu_preamble_impl.cc#L113
[20:36:39] <Hash[m]> Got it, so unpacked U8 goes in, optional preamble/tail can be added in the block, or just included as part of the U8 data, then it handles interpolation and goes to GMSK
[20:39:09] <Jacob[m]12> yeah, pretty much. pdu_preamble also does NRZ and float conversion before generating a float PDU, which goes into the pdu_gmsk block which will do pulseshaping and freq mod
[20:40:53] <Jacob[m]12> * freq mod (and generate a c32 PDU)
[20:46:00] <Jacob[m]12> also, thanks, this made me realize the gr-pdu examples weren't being installed properly.
[20:47:35] <Hash[m]> Yea, I just figured there were no examples 
[20:47:43] <Hash[m]> but saw in 3.10 there were some
[20:48:44] <Hash[m]> <Jacob[m]12> "yeah, pretty much. pdu_preamble..." <- NRZ is optional, but the float conversion seems like a major part I didn't realize it was doing
[20:49:55] <Jacob[m]12> You need NRZ for [reasonable] freq mod....  i suppose you could do it sided

[21:14:04] <BarryDuggan[m]> Is there a way to turn off that output?
[21:15:41] <Jacob[m]12> Yes you can set the log level above debug in the prefs file
[21:16:17] <Jacob[m]12> That is not really a DEBUG statement....more like TRACE which we don't support. I think it should go

[21:20:47] <Jacob[m]12> Hm. There are a few places it could be. I'm on mobile so I'm not of much help this second sorry
[21:21:23] <Jacob[m]12> There are a few "log level" runtime config options
[21:21:57] <BarryDuggan[m]> oh, I just found it in ~/.gnuradio/config.conf
[21:21:57] <BarryDuggan[m]> what level should I use?
