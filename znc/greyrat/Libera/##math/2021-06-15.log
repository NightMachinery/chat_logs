[00:49:14] <humanBird> yes
[00:49:14] <johnkeats6> or the average divided by c?
[00:49:31] <humanBird> the ratio matters as well
[00:49:57] <humanBird> for example, 2 would lead to the same average remainder for 33 and 100, .5   but .5 /2 is worse than .5/33

[00:56:09] <humanBird> yea. check all the numbers from 1 to min(a,b)
[00:56:23] <humanBird> average the remainders... compare the ratio
[00:56:29] <humanBird> very brute force.
[00:56:56] <johnkeats6> unless your data set is absolutely huge, i'd expect it to run pretty fast, because computing remainders is very easy
[00:58:36] <johnkeats6> don't waste time optimizing until you're sure bruteforce won't work

[03:02:06] <buster> you can measure potential energy on a balance (E=mc^2)
[03:02:47] <buster> put an electron and a positron in one pan and a positronium atom in the other
[03:03:08] <buster> the electron and positron have a greater mass
[03:03:25] <Inline> when it comes to potential energy, and you consider many of them to be around you, then i think i have to think of a discrete space filled with scalars, you can make it as much dense as you want that does not give any of them any dependency on each other

[08:06:49] <Cale> The same goes for arithmetic. There are (likely, hopefully) some sentences upon which the axioms of arithmetic place no restriction.
[08:07:08] <brownorange> completeness i mean
[08:08:31] <Cale> Well, some people hoped to find a finite collection of axioms that would uniquely specify a system of natural numbers. It turns out that was too much to ask, but it's sort of a natural thing to perhaps look for.
[08:14:35] *** Quits: bosspotato_ (~bosspotat@user/bosspotato) (Ping timeout: 244 seconds)
[08:15:28] <Cale> It's possible for example, if you remove multiplication from the language, to have a complete, consistent and decidable theory. See Presburger arithemtic.
[08:17:42] <brownorange> ah
[08:17:44] <Cale> There's also Skolem arithmetic, which is a formulation that omits addition, discussing only multiplication and various sorts of divisibility properties, which is also a decidable theory.
[08:18:13] <brownorange> i wonder though if removing the self-reference is more important
[08:18:33] <brownorange> like the response to the Russel Paradox, something should be done
[08:21:07] *** Joins: Ginalo (uid502518@id-502518.tinside.irccloud.com)
[08:21:53] <Cale> Well, certainly if you can reason about logical theories in some way, then it typically becomes possible to do the same trick that Gödel did. But usually we want our foundations of mathematics to be expressive enough to be able to discuss things of that sort. The natural numbers are a really awkward thing to build most other structures out of, and as a consequence, Gödel's proofs involved a lot of awkward encoding
[08:21:53] <Cale> . But usually we want that step to be even easier.
[08:23:02] <Cale> Maybe for numbers alone, you could imagine trying to get rid of it, but then you're going to have to remove something, and Gödel didn't use all that much -- just addition, multiplication, the logical quantifiers and connectives, equations and such.
[08:24:04] <Cale> Maybe you could start weakening the logic itself. I'm sure if you leave out quantifiers, everything will go okay.
[08:24:23] <Cale> But then you also can't say anything very interesting.

[08:28:29] <brownorange> for me i think it's about the proof system being consistent and complete
[08:28:33] <Cale> (and lives on in Libera, which is run by the same set of people the old Freenode was)

[08:38:10] <Cale> Often to be able to answer more questions is to speak of fewer things.

[12:12:01] <ccapndave> Hey mathematicians.  Apologies if this is a simple question, but when it comes to the AND and OR boolean operators, does it matter where brackets are placed?  I would have thought that it did, but I can't find an example where bracket placement changes the result.

[12:18:42] <riv> yes
[12:18:55] <riv> take the ring Z for example
[12:19:00] <riv> the units of Z are {-1,1}
[12:19:03] <riv> and this is a group
[12:19:15] <b3z> and that is called unit group
[12:20:04] <b3z> so in modulo 10 it would be {1, 3, 7, 9} ?!

[14:15:51] <pikapika> you would rather shift the rhs to the left by division

[14:17:31] <quarterback> This is a subproblem of another differential equation.
[14:17:59] <quarterback> The problem is dx = (1/2)x^2
[14:18:43] <quarterback> This I'm thinking of solving in two ways ---> (1) (integral) dx/x^2 = (integral) 1/2  and (2) (integral) dx = (1/2) (integral) x^2
[14:19:09] <quarterback> Can both these solutions be right?
[14:20:37] <pikapika> no
[14:20:42] <pikapika> only (1) is correct
[14:20:58] <quarterback> Why is that? Any particular reason?
[14:21:21] <pikapika> you cannot integrate without a differential operator inside
[14:21:55] <quarterback> Which side are you talking about?
[14:22:24] <quarterback> Differentiation and integration have rules. I was trying to remember them again.
[14:22:24] <pikapika> right in (2)
[14:22:49] <quarterback> Okay got it. Thanks.
[14:23:15] <pikapika> quarterback, actually
[14:23:16] <quarterback> dx or dy should be present when integrating a side.
[14:23:25] <pikapika> There is something funny with that notation anyways
[14:23:32] <pikapika> I should again ask you to present the main problem
[14:23:37] <pikapika> and how you arrived at this subproblem
[14:24:32] <pikapika> quarterback
[14:28:21] <quarterback> The main problem is xy´  = (1/2)y² + y . I did a substitution y=ux and therefore dy = u´x + u. Then the above equation was derived.

[14:32:22] <quarterback> The sub problem was with u after this. I used x as the variable.
[14:35:35] <pikapika> you don't need a substitution
[14:35:42] <pikapika> the original is easier to solve
[14:36:01] <pikapika> dy/(0.5y^2+y)=dx/x
[14:36:03] <pikapika> thats it
[14:36:54] <pikapika> quarterback
[14:36:55] <quarterback> I think you need substitution or else there will be residue in denominator in LHS.
[14:37:11] <pikapika> What residue?
[14:37:36] <quarterback> y or Y^2 wont be eliminated
[14:37:45] <pikapika> Why do you need to eliminate it?
[14:37:56] <pikapika> dy/(0.5y^2+y) = dx/x
[14:37:57] <pikapika> is finished
[14:38:01] <pikapika> just integrate both sides now
[14:38:02] <quarterback> How would you integrate it then?

[14:38:19] <pikapika> lhs is left as an exercize for you
[14:38:20] <pikapika> its easy
[14:38:29] <pikapika> it involves an arctangent I think

[14:39:54] <pikapika> quarterback, observe carefully
[14:39:58] <quarterback> No, you seem to have go tit wrong.
[14:40:01] <pikapika> the lhs is f(y)y
[14:40:06] <pikapika> the lhs is f(y)dy
[14:40:10] <pikapika> rhs is g(x)dx
[14:40:15] <pikapika> Just inregrate both sides now
[14:40:23] <pikapika> look
[14:40:35] <pikapika> you have x*dy/dx = (0.5y^2 + y)
[14:40:41] <pikapika> we shift the y's to the left and the x's to the right
[14:40:42] <pikapika> we get
[14:40:53] <pikapika> dy/(0.5y^2+y) = dx/x
[14:40:53] <pikapika> done
[14:41:44] <quarterback> You have to integrate it and bring it interms of y and x without using y´ and x´ in end result.
[14:41:55] <pikapika> which I have already shown you how to
[14:41:59] <quarterback> That is called a general solution.
[14:42:07] <pikapika> Thats not a general solution
[14:42:11] <quarterback> You didn't show a general solution, you merely re arranged the differential equation.

[15:52:48] <johnkeats6> well that's a thing i wonder about
[15:53:26] <buster> yeah?
[15:53:48] <johnkeats6> in EM you learn how to solve maxwell's eqs for a given (4-vector) current density on all of spacetime. but reality should be more like: you start with a current density on a cauchy surface, and the electromagnetic field co-evolves along with the current density

[19:45:27] <somiaj> dauggy: Phi(a >= b) makes no sense then, since CDF's have inputs of real numbers not statements
[19:45:44] <dauggy> ... wut?
[19:45:58] <dauggy> ah right
[19:46:04] <somiaj> the standard normal CDF is a function from R -> [0,1]
[19:46:04] <cadmio> I had to "Determine the inner automorphism group of A4 (alternating subgroup of S4)."

[19:46:46] <somiaj> is if Phi(a) >= 0.5, then Phi(b) <= 0.5 for b < a (you could also say b<=a there since it won't matter)

[19:47:26] <somiaj> because Phi is a function of real numbers, you have to input a real number into it. 'max a>b' is not a real number.

[19:49:45] <rubiksdream> cadmio that would only happen for any g in Z(A_4), and Z(A_4) is trivial, so that would never happen for all x
[19:49:56] <drogas22> hahaha I have to admit, I'm not a fan of it myself, but have to. I am wondering how I can take the absolute values of the individual values inside a matrix in mathcad
[19:50:14] <drogas22> basically I wanna |A| where A is the matrix.
[19:50:19] <cadmio> why is Z(A_4) trivial how can I verify it?
[19:50:37] <somiaj> drogas22: |A| has meaning different than what you want, so I doubt that will work.
[19:51:04] <somiaj> drogas22: you might need to just make a new matrix, and loop trhough the enteries in A, so b_{ij} = |a_{ij}|

[23:21:34] <susam> Sorry about this spam but some members from this channel have been attending the analytic number theory book club meetings I have been hosting for a few months.
