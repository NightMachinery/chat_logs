[20:36:44] <tabakhase> tylee not sure i get your Q... - first those are kinda two storys, "docker" and "rootless docker" are a tad different --- "not beeing root and using docker" you can "kinda" do with either of the two - where "rootless" you rly dont need root anywhere (except setup) and "everything in that docker-daemon will be usermapped" --- while "using real docker without sudo" you can also make possible by 
[20:36:45] <tabakhase> just allowing your user to write to that .sock file (by adding him to the dockergroup for example), but in this case, one could potentially abuse this and escalate to the host, as "nothing is stoping anyone from `docker run -it -v /:/host debian bash` and go exploring" or even "directly go to root on the host" via `docker run --privileged --pid=host -it alpine:3.8 nsenter -t 1 -m -u -n -i sh`

[20:42:47] <tabakhase> "windows docker" is not a thing (well windows containers is, but noone does that :P) - so "docker dekstop" usually is a VM with linux. hyperV these days, i would expect that to fail greatly...

[22:48:08] <Enissay> I have a container running using `docker run -d --name xxx ...`, sadly it stops randomly and I see later `Exited (1) 16 hours ago` (bug reported)... I was thinking of adding a `--restart unless-stopped` but since I try to re-run the container I get `Conflict. The container name "/xxx" is already in use by container...` I wonder if that restart policy will work ? Or maybe I should loose the `--name
[22:48:11] <Enissay> xxx` as well to avoid any conflict ?

[22:56:07] <tabakhase> Enissay you can not "edit" a container, so to add the restart bit youll have to remove the dead one first

[22:57:24] <tabakhase> that will fix the already in use^^
[23:00:23] <Enissay> yeah, I got it, my question, if I use `restart`, then it fails, will it manage to restart properly or will it fail with the same `conflict name` message ?

[23:01:30] <Enissay> Anyhow, I just restarted it with the `--restart unless-stopped` and will discover in a few days I guess whether that worked or not xD
[23:02:25] <hydracat> What's a good base machine for a docker install? I'm considering ubuntu-server or fedora at the moment but open to other idea. I want something with good documentation 
[23:03:24] <Enissay> I've been using debian for years, no complains so far

[23:22:17] <ada_> Enissay: a container that restarts is the same container
[23:22:33] <ada_> Enissay: you could only ever hit this message when trying to `docker run` a new container with the same name as another one that already exists
[23:22:56] <ada_> Enissay: if you set the restart policy on a container, it's the same container; just restarted.  `docker run` is analogous to `docker create && docker start` so it implies making a new object
