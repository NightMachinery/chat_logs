[00:42:03] <matsaman> you gotta try new things every now and then, though, even if only confirm you already have it great
[00:42:04] <SnoopJ> If you are shopping for an IDE, PyCharm and VS Code are both definitely on the list, but...yea, text editors edit text. Don't fret about it if what you have is working for you.
[00:42:21] <SnoopJ> (especially because every moment spent on tooling is a moment *not* spent on [whatever else you're doing])
[00:42:34] <toma> matsaman: not happy but all I do is open, type, save and close. I assume at some point I'll want autocompletion, and be able to jump around easier than just using up and down arrows.
[00:42:55] * mmalter is sipping a beer, not working on his tools
[00:43:07] <ouestbillie> toma: for jumping just use etags, its simple and it works
[00:43:10] <toma> matsaman: It seems cumbersome but I don't know it well. I thyink I'll move onto PyCharm in the future and try to learn it.
[00:43:15] <ouestbillie> for autocompletion there is anaconda mode
[00:43:38] <SnoopJ> toma, you can get that kind of stuff in emacs, if you're willing to climb its learning cliff. If you think you'd feel more comfortable with a GUI IDE, it's worth at least trying one.
[00:43:44] <ouestbillie> though settin up emacs as an ide is definitely NOT a way to save time not working on tooling

[00:45:08] <ouestbillie> s/little no/little to no/
[00:45:18] <SnoopJ> worth pointing out too that many editors offer emacs/vim compatibility layers these days. I use VS Code with a plugin that gives me vim bindings, so I can do most of the stuff I'm used to doing in vim.
[00:45:22] <toma> ouestbillie: I thought you were talking about playing Doom in a game. Didn't understand. I'll google that too.

[04:53:06] <Andrew> Oh, that sounds right
[04:53:08] <Andrew> Thanks
[04:53:14] <hrob> t4nk_freenode   on the ubuntu OS you can check the libx11 version as so:   dpkg -l | grep libx11
[04:53:34] <SnoopJ> Andrew, I was thinking you'd printed a list of strings, one string per line, for some reason :)

[04:53:49] <t4nk_freenode> I'll check, hrob, let me fire it up
[04:53:56] <Andrew> Wait, would simple eval() work?
[04:54:12] <hrob> t4nk_freenode   im not sure about gentoo what package manager it uses
[04:54:31] <hrob> t4nk_freenode but worth comparing the versions of libx11
[04:54:41] <t4nk_freenode> yes
[04:54:47] <Andrew> Anyways, literal_eval works. thanks!
[04:55:41] <Andrew> lol I seem to be using recursion on everything due to the lisp mindset
[04:55:51] <SnoopJ> Andrew, eval() would work but it's a bad idea because it can execute arbitrary code. literal_eval() is safe if all you wanna do is deserialize a literal
[04:55:51] <t4nk_freenode> I'm currently movinglibffi version up to libffi-3.4.2-r1, but that now is recompiling my python versions, .. and firefox if I don't intervene ;)

[10:39:53] <dale> It is only with great trepidation that I even consider wading into the topic of code formatting... but one thing no one seems to acknowledge is how many developers (1) use editors that have very limited features WRT tabs/spaces/indentation and/or have no knowledge of how to configure it, (2) how many developers will give exactly zero fucks about tabs and/or spaces and/or learning to configure their
[10:39:55] <dale> editor, and (3) will make this your problem.

[10:53:51] <TML> I actually had to sit on Friday and watch a supposed "Senior Developer" using Apple Pages as their "IDE"
[10:54:09] <NeilRG> what do you guys use as your IDE?
[10:54:16] <matsaman> Vim =)
[10:54:51] <TML> I think it was the 5th or 6th time he pasted a curly quote to his shell that I finally said "Stop. I can't watch this anymore. Please use a text editor instead of a word processing program."
[10:55:12] <NeilRG> yeah me too.  I tried PyCharm, but it was so much slower than Vim that I went back to Vim.  Also, their vim bindings were very incomplete.
[10:55:21] <NeilRG> TML hahahahah
[10:55:34] <NeilRG> that's unbelievable
[10:56:27] <NeilRG> when i was in college, I was trying out for the ACM programming contest team for the first time, and that's when I thought I would use Vim because everyone else was.

[10:56:42] <NeilRG> I raised my hand after two minutes: "how do you add a line"?

[10:58:45] <NeilRG> also I remember interning at Microsoft ages ago and when I asked to use Vim as my editor, this developer straight rolled his eyes at me.  I forget what they used, but it was some IDE

And then I make a list comprehension on its values "supported_modes = [chanmode for chanmodes in state.chanmodes.values() for chanmode in chanmodes]". Why would mypy give me an error like ""object" has no attribute "__iter__"; maybe "__str__" or "__dir__"? (not iterable)" ?

[14:38:22] <jinsun> Adoi: the package insistency message usually tells which packages are conflicting, you have to figure out from that if you need to update or remove them
[14:39:23] <Adoi> jinsun, yes, I know but it shows a load (even torrents) of inconsistent packages..sure not a good idea to remove them all :)
[14:39:34] <jinsun> Adoi: the easier option is to create a new conda environment starting from scrapy `conda create -n scrapyenv scrapy`
[14:39:54] <jinsun> then use that env for your scrapy projects
[14:40:19] <Adoi> jinsun, yeah, but it comes with its own problems..then all other needed packages have to be installed again in the new env

[14:45:34] <Adoi> oh no, I'd rather stick with one sort of env :)

I have a question: what should be the best approach for printing the same greeting message for each member of a given list? I've tried https://bpa.st/6PLQ and I know that this is not the correct method of doing it. I know there can be other ways
[16:42:57] <DavidMilestone> involving functions, but I am curious to know a solution that works similarly to what I've tried so far. Thank you so much.

One fixes this by doing x=`list(i for i in range(10))`. However if x is never used, then there is no need consuming the generator. Passing generators and iterators around are quite neat.

[18:48:17] <kosh> jinsun, if you want to use something an ancient as  tensorflow 1.1.0 there is no choice on that
[18:48:30] <kosh> if you want to train on a GPU that is going to make this REALLY hard
[18:48:31] <panella32> kosh jinsun any suggestion what should I do to install these dependencies? I have to mention I've never used Anaconda or conda!! https://i.imgur.com/ZHioq49.png
[18:49:20] <kosh> panella32, you are dealing with a really old package it seems and you would need to create a python 2.7 conda environment and then install tensorflow 1.1.0 in there
[18:49:39] <jinsun> kosh: yeah, if you HAVE to use 1.1.0 then you are stuck with the older python, but is there really any good reason to stick to 1.1.0?
[18:50:07] <kosh> panella32, do you have a specific reason to need 1.1.0? also do you need to train it on a GPU?
[18:50:50] <kosh> jinsun, one of the downsides of tensorflow is google has broken backwards compatibility a lot, more than just in major versions
[18:51:02] <panella32> Honestly it's not my choice. I found a github repo asking for those dependencies.
[18:51:10] <kosh> what repo?
[18:51:22] <kosh> also what about the GPU part?

[18:52:36] * panella32 wishes kosh had some advice for him!
[18:53:19] <kosh> panella32, I think you best bet is install tensorflwo 1.15 and see if the code works with that version
[18:54:01] <kosh> but you will have to use python 2.7 because that is what the code is written for and the code has been abandoned

[18:54:08] <mefistofeles> tensorflow 1.x was such a mess, it's gotten a bit better with 2.x
[18:54:22] *** Joins: c4017w_ (~c4017@209.52.68.8)
[18:54:56] <kosh> mefistofeles, it has gotten better but I have still run into things that have broken between releases
[18:55:56] <panella32> kosh Thanks. I have something to ask btw. Almost all related repos on github have a section called "training". I wonder why it's important and whether it can be skipped or not. Also would it be possible to fulfill this "training" step without being a power user? Looks very complicated..

[18:55:58] <mefistofeles> kosh: minor releases?
[18:56:21] <kosh> panella32, so try using python 2.7 and tensorflow 1.15 and see if you can get that to work
[18:56:36] <kosh> panella32, training is critically important, it won't function otherwise and neural networks are very complicated
[18:56:46] <kosh> mefistofeles, between 2.x releases
[18:57:11] <panella32> Thanks again kosh
[18:57:31] <mefistofeles> panella32: sometimes you do get serialized tensorflow models that you can use right away, check that

[22:18:06] <bizolos> Hi there. I created two simple objects from a same class, with the same attributes, but obj1 == obj2 is False. I expected True. I know I can implement __eq__ if I know precisely what I want from my class to be comparable, but what does Python does in case of __eq__ being absent? What is the fallback? obj1 == obj1 is True. Does it fallback to is ?
