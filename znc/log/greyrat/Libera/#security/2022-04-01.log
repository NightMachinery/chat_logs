[12:23:36] <pagios> PGP question, i understand that ubuntu for example uses PGP to sign packages and verify them. Say i have a website, and i am publishing a software, i sign it and ppl can download and verify using my public key. NOW my website gets comromised, an attacker creates a new package, signs it with its FAKE name which is mine and publishes his key too on the website. Now ppl download it and verigfy it all good. How does PGP protect me in this case?

[13:10:53] <piou> pagios: people can notice that the public key is different (in particular people managing repos should notice that), and that's why large key publication (via key servers, wot strategies...) is essential to PGP. But you're right, this scenario isn't well covered by that signature system. On the other hand it's quite the scenario and pgp package signatures protect against other attacks that are
[13:10:59] <piou> easier to perform. In particular note that it means that you don't have to rely on HTTPS to ensure that no man-in-the-middle takes place where someone switches a legitimate package for a malicious one. That's relevant also relevant for things like debian repos where you want many people to provide the package but you need a way to make sure none of them switches the package.

[16:40:13] <piou> thing is, with this definition the method doesn't matter. Either they divert the process toward something that profits them (in which case that's a security issue) or they can divert but it can't profit (in which case it's not)

[16:41:28] <piou> So the question is should you care about the case where the attacker can't profit (not necessarily financial profit, just a note) ? Does it matter that someone can do something weird with a software if it can't cause any issue?
[16:42:09] <piou> To be that's the difference between a bug and a security issue, and your definition would pretty much classify all bugs as security issues

[16:47:41] <piou> Two examples: self XSS and notepad filename buffer overflow.  In the case of an XSS that requires the user to do a complex operation (so not just clicking on a link) in order to inflict the XSS on themselves there is no clear way to exploit the issue so even though it is possible for someone to subvert the flow of the web application it is not a security issue. Similarly, I think MS notepad.exe
[16:47:47] <piou> still has a buffer overflow with long filenames, and you could possibly use it for remote code execution, but unless you find a way to profit from that as an attacker it's not a security issue, it's just a bug. And now that I'm thinking about it, in environments where applications are locked down but you have the rights to execute notepad.exe it could allow you to escape your jail and run
[16:47:53] <piou> arbitrary code. So maybe it is a security issue after all.
[16:48:14] <piou> But not because we can subvert the proper operations of the program, rather it's because we found a way to profit from it.

[17:03:57] <B4ckBOne> errrr xD yes
[17:04:16] <piou> B4ckBOne: as I said the issue with that line of thought is that all bugs become security issues, and it becomes much harder to say that a system is secure because how do you even define it then?  A program can be bug free, but for a full system there are so many interractions (including human ones) that you can never guarantee it will only ever do what it's supposed to
[17:04:49] <B4ckBOne> yes
[17:05:07] <B4ckBOne> And you cant call a system secure anyway. At least in my mind.

[17:05:50] <piou> B4ckBOne: but you should, because that kind of "it's never enough" mentality also makes it harder (if not impossible) to identify places where you spend too much resources on security
[17:05:54] <liqidmetalman> i got venom to boot though...
[17:05:55] <B4ckBOne> pagios, did passbolt have some independent code-reviews like Bitwarden?
[17:06:24] <piou> B4ckBOne: and spending too much on one place means that you're wasting your resources where they could be necessary on another front
[17:06:44] <pagios> B4ckBOne:  i am not sure. bitwarden is not free i need to self host too
[17:07:29] <piou> B4ckBOne: there's a reason why this is the definition that has been adopted by most of security researchers, especially in more theoretical fields (if not all, I'm leaving a margin of uncertainty but I don't know anyone who uses something else)
[17:08:15] <piou> On the other hand, at the application level your definition has the advantage of pushing to fix bugs, although it probably makes it harder to establish priority
[17:09:07] <B4ckBOne> piou, i agree. Just dont like thinking in absolutes. Maybe one could define secure in certain economic context as crossing a margin of uncertainty.
[17:09:23] <piou> B4ckBOne: this *is* an economic definition
[17:09:52] <piou> has to be to account for resource management
[17:10:10] <piou> that said, can you develop what you mean by margin of uncertainty in that context ?
[17:11:56] <B4ckBOne> Threat asessment. Account for everything you are protecting. Then look at ways it can be compromised. And determine to which extent the system protects you against it being compromised. Then list all the things, ways and weight them in a balanced scorecard :)

[17:14:20] <piou> The thing is, you weigh against the ability to profit from a given attack, it's a very simple expected gain calculation
[17:15:13] <B4ckBOne> Hmmm, what if there are unknown ways the attacker can profit.
[17:15:34] <B4ckBOne> Would either definition account for it?
[17:15:39] <piou> That's the hard part in practice yet

[17:18:38] <piou> B4ckBOne: example: political visibility can be bought through other means so you have something to compare it to. Fun is a good example too: how much are you willing to spent to see a good movie? Say $10? $20? That movie will be 2h long so you value 1h of fun $10.

[17:30:43] <piou> it seems very strange that a whatsapp msg would have any consequence on her IG
[17:30:44] <greatcoof> i figured that someone sent the msg AND tried to log into her ig to many times just to be annoying
[17:30:45] <B4ckBOne> greatcoof, so you already have an indicator of compromise.
[17:31:18] <B4ckBOne> dump a copy of the filesystem and get the tools out?
[17:31:27] <liqidmetalman> what does the "0" stand for?
[17:31:29] <liqidmetalman> ...
[17:31:30] <piou> especially because it's very hard for an application to interract with another, so if you had a whatsapp+android 0day you probably wouldn't be using to annoy someone by doing bad logging on IG
[17:31:37] <liqidmetalman> in the names...

[17:34:06] <B4ckBOne> greatcoof, a more likely scenario could be that the attacker tried to divert all traffic which got detected by IG servers and locked the account temporarily
[17:34:17] <piou> Some people use the term 1day to mean a vulnerability for which a patch exist but that isn't widely deployed yet, but it's not a term that's much used.
[17:34:38] <liqidmetalman> oic
[17:34:55] <piou> Nah, that makes no sense, how is IG supposed to detect that?
[17:35:23] <B4ckBOne> Different IP address. Different Certificates in case someone used sslstrip and stuff
[17:35:35] <piou> 1) if it's diverted it may not be sent to IG at all, 2) if it's proxied then it's just a new location with the same data, nothing to detect, and it's a phone, they're expected to have different ips all the time
[17:35:45] <B4ckBOne> Men in the middle need to divert traffic to become the man in the middle
