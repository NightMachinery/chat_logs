[00:02:06] <realies> you can no longer build your images on push to github?
[00:02:19] <realies> *on docker hub

[00:12:06] <realies> i meant it more in the sense of, how is github actions a thing, but free docker builds is not a thing 
[00:12:56] <ada_> yeah couldn't say, I actually didn't know about the free tier usage thing until you said something

I will soon be installing Docker on a server in my home lab and I do not want it to inadvertedly open some way into the server. I use pure iptables with custom rules but I am open to changing the firewalling solution (will do so eventually anyway)
[02:21:09] <jochum> plantroon: my way is to us shorewall with Docker = yes

[02:27:31] <plantroon> do you disable docker's iptables functionality though?
[02:27:43] <jochum> plantroon: no
[02:29:05] <jochum> plantroon: about a week ago, my sis needed a router with some docker containers on it, I thought easy, just some make unifi-controller with docker on it and put shorewall in front. It wasn't easy until i found shorewall.conf -> docker = yes.
[02:29:32] <jochum> plantroon: after that I could finish here router/server in a short time.

[04:19:12] <jochum> zoredache: you don't have those ports listed in "ss -lntp" ?
[04:21:50] <zoredache> Hrm yes. it is on dockerd.  (paste updated with the output)

[04:41:10] <zoredache> I forgot overlay networks get an address from both the docker_gwbridge and the custom network.
[04:42:20] <jochum> zoredache: so you have found a workaround?
[04:42:26] <zoredache> I adjusted creation, so only the the overlay network, and the iptables rules that get created are addresses in the range for the docker_gwbridge
[04:42:44] <zoredache> not a workaround, just actually working, and I was worrying about something that is apparently not a problem.
[04:43:08] <jochum> zoredache: how do they (the containers) communicate internaly?

[13:47:40] <cluelessperson> So, I have a docker container running a service that can call a local command when it handles an event.
[13:48:01] <cluelessperson> I'd like it to connect somehow to another docker container and trigger a command there.
[13:48:06] <cluelessperson> how should I go about this?
[14:13:58] *** Quits: swebb (~swebb@161.97.198.243) (Ping timeout: 265 seconds)
[14:16:26] <Lyn> is it ever necessary to EXPOSE ports? (context: I'm planning to pull out all hardcoded network variables into env vars, and now I'm puzzled if I can/should modify Dockerfiles' EXPOSE lines to refer to env vars)
[14:18:20] *** Joins: swebb (~swebb@161.97.198.243)
[14:30:49] <cluelessperson> Lyn, my understanding is the expose instruction exposes a port to be available to other containers on the same network, especially for say databases and such to connect between each other,  but it does NOT publish them to the host
[14:31:14] <cluelessperson> Lyn, so they're not necessary, but definitely useful for showing defaults for people to use and help communication between multiple containers.
[14:35:02] <jochum> cluelessperson: to your question, one option is to write a helper service/run xinetd another is to expose docker.sock to container b and run over docker sock a command in container a
[14:35:24] <jochum> cluelessperson: still looking for the kubernetes way of doing so, they have a name for that
[14:35:55] <jochum> cluelessperson: xinetd - you could break the "one process per container" rule for that
[14:40:12] <cluelessperson> jochum, I'm hoping to not have to build these containers. :P
[14:40:30] <cluelessperson> I like the docker.sock idea
[14:40:44] <cluelessperson> not sure how to do it in practice though
[14:41:27] <jochum> cluelessperson: I can help, but would love to hear if its the way to go.
[14:41:39] <jochum> cluelessperson: not that expert here.
[14:41:54] <cluelessperson> jochum, it sounds like the reasonable way to go.  I'm not sure how to have something listen to the docker.sock to run the commands though
[14:42:03] <jochum> cluelessperson: you mount it
[14:42:20] <cluelessperson> I mean I could write python to use a socket and all, but I"m hoping for something ultra simple.
[14:42:45] <jochum> you install docker (i think theres a cli package only)
[14:43:11] <jochum> then you call docker exec <some-container> /bin/false
[14:43:42] <cluelessperson> oooh, giving access to the docker service to the container
[14:43:49] <cluelessperson> that's a bit too far for me actually. :P
[14:44:17] <jochum> ye
[14:44:27] <jochum> Its a way to solve your problem
[14:44:52] <jochum> cluelessperson: sidecar i think those called
[14:44:55] <cluelessperson> it's close to what I want.
[14:45:04] <cluelessperson> maybe I can setup ssh commands.
[14:45:19] <jochum> you break rule
[14:45:24] <cluelessperson> ugh, the first container is heavily firewalled though
[14:46:33] <jochum> sidecar containers just share a mount
[14:46:54] <jochum> They have theier own wheel
[14:46:56] <jochum> :)
[14:47:13] <cluelessperson> ooh that might work
[14:47:27] <jochum> ? yes?
[14:47:29] <cluelessperson> share a mount,   send just makes a file with a command
[14:47:34] <jochum> Next question would have been state :)
[14:47:39] <cluelessperson> receive side just watches the directory for changes and runs the command
[14:47:55] <jochum> cluelessperson: why not NATS or something like that?
[14:48:02] <cluelessperson> NATS?
[14:48:06] <jochum> Event system
[14:48:14] <jochum> like rabbitmq

[14:48:48] <cluelessperson> jochum, I'm seeking a super simple solution with pre-existing docker implementations, not to program my own entire system by myself.

[14:52:56] <cluelessperson> jochum, in this case, just a single event,  "this new thing is ready in this directory, scan it"
[14:53:20] <jochum> ahh so you go with a share volume/mount?
[14:53:34] <jochum> cluelessperson: I hoped you could install the command in Container b
[14:53:45] <jochum> That why I was asking
[14:53:59] <cluelessperson> well, they share a mount to operate on,   the hard part is just triggering the scan

They can even put the result of the job into the backend.
[17:58:21] <programmerq> a job can pretty much be anything-- including your case of running a command

[19:09:46] <Razva> when using `docker-compose` how can I set the `volume` location?
[19:10:53] <Razva> in this example - https://paste.debian.net/hidden/8c203ed8/ - I basically want to specify the location of the `nextcloud` volume.

[19:13:55] <Razva> got it, but where do I specify the physical path to the volume?
[19:14:03] <Razva> because I need it to be in a specific place
[19:14:40] <Razva> like .. `postgresd:/path/to/location` ?
[19:16:37] *** onelegend is now known as MachX
[19:17:01] <jochum> Razva: volumes aren't ment to get paths from what i know
[19:17:10] <jochum> Razva: please lookup the docs of docker volumes
[19:17:35] <Razva> I'm reading that, it can be done, but I'm kinda lost hence me asking here :)
[19:17:37] <jochum> Razva: you can have bind mounts with docker-compose wihthout volume, pretty sure thats what you want.
[19:18:18] <jochum> Razva: bind mount = replace "nextcloud:" with "./relative-path-from-compose:"
[19:18:34] <Razva> yeah, I can do that, but I was just curious of how to do the volume thing
[19:19:02] <jochum> Razva: I use bind mounts where i need the data in same folder and don't have permissions troubles, i use volumes for everything else
[19:19:22] <jochum> Razva: I also love volumes for postgres its always there whatever i do

[19:19:38] <jochum> Razva: once i wish to remove the volume i use the various "docker volume" commands
[19:19:58] <Razva> that's my target as well, because I need to post volumes on the `/ssd` location, not on `/var/whatever` 
[19:20:29] <jochum> Razva: well bind mount allows full paths, if its that what you wihs

[19:22:46] <[twisti]> i have containers configured with `restart: unless-stopped`. i start them with `docker-compose up -d`. then i do `sudo service docker restart`, and they dont come back up. they should, right ? thats how that is supposed to work ? programmerq they are not attached to anything but external networks
[19:24:21] <jochum> [twisti]: try 'restart: always' that works for me
[19:24:50] <jochum> [twisti]: as long I don't stop the container it always cames back after reboot
[19:24:53] <[twisti]> jochum: but ... i dont want them to always restart. are you saying the policy unless-stopped is not functional ?
[19:25:01] <jochum> [twisti]: no clue
[19:25:07] <jochum> [twisti]: just telling you what works for me
[19:25:28] <[twisti]> thats weird advice then. "my bmw's lights are broken" - "have you tried driving ford?"

[21:42:54] <Lyn> what happens if I do ports: -":3050:80" ? i.e. omit the host but still have a :
[21:44:40] <Activ8> that means you hit port 3050 on outside and 80 is inside the container.  for example https://127.0.0.1:3050
[21:45:01] <Lyn> ah so the extra : won't do anything?
[21:45:21] <tabakhase> that should explode...
[21:45:29] <Lyn> really
[21:46:18] <tabakhase> "ommiting the host" makes it use default whats 0.0.0.0 = all interfaces  --- and as found recently, supposedly compose even kinda ignores that if you try to set something else as default
[21:47:04] <Activ8> oh I see what you did there the extra : in front, sorry.  I haven't tested it like that never did it.

[21:54:53] <Lyn> am I doing anything clearly stupid with these files lol, or is this fine https://i.imgur.com/vU3ekhj.png
[21:57:49] <tabakhase> Lyn why even worry about nginx internal port at all?
[21:58:53] <Lyn> not really sure, I found some Google Cloud docs that said containers should listen on the port defined by the PORT environment variable
[21:59:45] <tabakhase> and variable dockerfile may be "questionable" - that should be somewhat static... having a extra one for dev just gives room to mess up :/ if its rly needed, see if you can maybe do it just by build-arg (ideally its the same image tho..)
[22:00:33] <tabakhase> and you may wanne set defaults, ${varName:-ifNotValue} so 90% get away without .env file :P
[22:00:54] <Lyn> I see, good points
[22:00:55] <tabakhase> and idk about gpc-specifics..., possible that that adds some more requirements there
