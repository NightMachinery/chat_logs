[00:25:08] <bpalmer> good luck, though.

[01:55:11] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Oh for sure. But it'll also be like pulling teeth.
[01:55:14] <rpav> nah
[01:55:45] <rpav> the syntax is slightly hairy for some things but it's pretty straightforward and you just want a hack anyway so 
[01:56:15] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Yeah, though when I start using proper structures is usually when I graduate from hack to "proper script".
[01:56:23] <rpav> yea definitely
[01:56:58] <rpav> i wrote an "atool" replacement in pure bash and i use maps in that, mostly just to map file extensions and mime types to compression/archive suites, but
[01:57:20] <rpav> a few idioms and it's reasonably elegant

[03:43:38] <Catie> Yeah, isn't that nuts? X is backwards because -- if I understand it correctly -- it was designed back in the day when you had wimpy underpowered workstations but a beefy workhorse mainframe, so work was shunted off onto the remote mainframe as much as possible
[03:45:11] <johnjaye> that makes sense
[03:45:26] <Catie> Although now that I'm thinking about it, that doesn't sound quite right. The Apple Macintosh came out in 1984, same year as the first release of the X Window System, and it was a consumer PC with a full GUI. Maybe it was the cost that made the difference? Shucks, I'm not sure anymore

[06:39:29] <Catie> It lives in my head at all times
[06:39:35] <grym> but, have you filked it 
[06:40:18] <Catie> I could not even begin to tell you. Maybe?
[06:40:19] <aidalgol> I showed it to my mum without telling her what it really was, and her reaction when it started getting fucked up (in the first episode) was *gold*.
[06:41:00] <aidalgol> She liked it, but was not expecting to veer off the deep end.  She was at first wondering why on earth I was showing her a British kids' TV show.
[06:41:18] <Catie> That was essentially my thought process the first time through as well, yeah

[12:43:56] <avN0> in mu4e/gnus-article the color differs widely, how can I specify a specifiy fore-/background for gnus-articles?
[12:44:17] <kiki_lamb> irek: yeah, I want to adjust any and all faces, but only when they appear in the mode line. if this were a regular mode, I'd stick a face remap on default in it's mode hook, but I don't know if the mode line has a similar hook I can use.

[12:49:48] <irek> avN0: move cursor over face you like to change and use M-x descibe-face
[12:50:10] <irek> avN0: it will automatically suggest face that is under the cursor
[12:50:30] <crazazy> well I couldn't find other things in emacs that don't have the exact same effect as shell-command
[12:50:54] <aidalgol> Because they're not invoking the shell.

[12:51:10] <aidalgol> If you're trying to write a launcher, you should be spawning the processes directly, not via the shell.
[12:51:29] <crazazy> oh wait I can use call-process
[12:52:35] <avN0> irek: it suggests "default" but weird thing is in my gnus-article it is black on white and the face-description with M-x list-faces-display it's shown as white on black?
[12:53:06] <avN0> irek: I try to set a hook for this and will state my results
[12:53:12] <aidalgol> Apparently, if you pass 0 for the DESTINATION argument to `call-process', it returns immediately without waiting for the subprocess to exit.

[18:47:05] <wasamasa> basically, it tries auto-detecting whether the server is already running and that takes a lot of time

[19:00:28] <rpav> imagine if things were more generally distributed-objecty, and your shell had sortof more smalltalk syntax 🤔 not sure that sells it outside my target crowd of probably 3 people, but
[19:00:37] <Bayes> I also tend to work with stuff that's installed in every system by default because most of the stuff I do is meant for many HPC configurations that (i) I don't manage, (ii) need not have the same configurations... and also I can't be bothered contacting ITs for my own kinks
[19:00:47] <rpav> i have a working parser, going to hopefully get the evaluator well on its way this weekend
[19:01:05] <rpav> Bayes: yeah that's why i've been writing a fair bit of bash

[19:01:35] <Bayes> yup, bash, emacs with defaults, and a bunch of gnu tools that virtually every system should ship with and we good
[19:02:53] <rpav> emacs with defaults?!
[19:03:09] <rpav> but you can so easily customize it user-side
[19:03:53] <Bayes> can't be bothered :D
[19:04:25] <rpav> what do you use emacs for then?
[19:04:26] <Bayes> I use 4 separate HPC clusters
[19:04:31] <Bayes> quick editing
[19:04:48] <rpav> i mean fair i guess .. you can't tramp/ssh into them?
[19:04:55] <Bayes> I try to do all the editing locally and push things "ready to run"
[19:05:03] <Bayes> yeah I tried once
[19:05:29] <rpav> i don't have a ton of luck with it either ;/ neat idea but a combination of "often fails" and "hard to remember" dont' help
[19:06:49] <Bayes> typically I don't need to, I really thrive for pushing things that work out of the box, and... when it fails, it typically needs such a tiny edit that even nano will suffice

[19:11:40] <cvandusen> The keybindings are close enough. vi/vim is a waste of time to remember.
