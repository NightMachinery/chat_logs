[00:21:24] <AnonymooseReddtr> vinrock wtf?
[00:21:30] <AnonymooseReddtr> wouldn't the armorer know the difference
[00:21:33] <int0x1C8> k, no clue wtf you're talking about, I'm missing some context here
[00:22:29] <vinrock> when alec baldwin killed the lady on his movie set a few weeks ago
[00:22:43] <vinrock> they've been trying to throw the armorer under the bus, but they hired her because they dint want to pay for a real armorer
[00:22:50] <int0x1C8> what?!
[00:22:54] <vinrock> shes 23 years old with no experience and was also working as a prop assistant on set
[00:23:01] <vinrock> you didnt hear about this...?
[00:23:09] <int0x1C8> alec baldwin the actor?
[00:23:11] <vinrock> baldwin straight up merked someone
[00:23:12] <vinrock> yup
[00:23:16] <int0x1C8> jesus
[00:23:47] <vinrock> hes also the producer, it was a low budget film and he started practicing his draw with a loaded firearm
[00:23:55] <vinrock> ended up shooting and killing a camera lady
[00:23:58] <int0x1C8> ...
[00:24:37] <vinrock> turns out, the gun had a real bullet in the cylinder
[00:24:46] <vinrock> when there should never be real bulets on a movie set
[00:24:52] <spiderman> holy shit terraform updates actually went smoothly
[00:25:24] <int0x1C8> right, the gun having a real round in it is NOT the issue there
[00:26:27] <spiderman> int0x1C8: alec baldwin memes have been nonstop in my face, it was huge news
[00:26:38] <vinrock> movie set was apparently plagued with issues due to poor working conditions
[00:27:07] <vinrock> iirc the union production crew walked off set the morning the shooting happened and they hired a bunch of people off the street to fill those roles
[00:27:16] <vinrock> the lady that was shot is the only one who stayed behind to finish the project
[00:27:47] <int0x1C8> I'm very far removed from anything pop culture
[00:28:09] <spiderman> int0x1C8: I am too... I found out through a kingcobrajfs discord server
[00:28:15] <vinrock> ive loathed baldwin since i heard the mesage he left his daughter
[00:28:23] <vinrock> so im enjoying this drama
[00:28:47] <int0x1C8> no idea what the message with the daughter is either
[00:28:53] <vinrock> this was years back
[00:29:05] <vinrock> but he basically screamed at his 12 year old daughter that shes a piece of shit
[00:29:14] <spiderman> idk man, I can't seem to get myself riled up at people I don't know
[00:29:16] <vinrock> it was horrible
[00:29:26] <vinrock> well ofc dont get riled up thats dumb
[00:29:50] <spiderman> we've all done awful shit. the difference between me and a celebrity is that if I fuck up it doesn't make news
[00:30:00] <vinrock> if i dont like someone its more like... if i ever randomly encounter that person walking into the store when i leave, pff, im not gonna hold the door for them
[00:30:17] <vinrock> not like i actualy have spite against em

[01:14:01] <spiderman> has anyone seen a linux box panic because it ran out of memory?
[01:14:34] <spiderman> we had a webserver OOM-kill 16 processes in under a minute then go offline, no swap 
[01:14:57] <Cl0udNinja> yep
[01:15:00] <Cl0udNinja> sounds right
[01:15:26] <spiderman> I figured that's what happened. There's just no official log saying "kernel panicked, sorry"
[01:15:55] <Cl0udNinja> assuming its a VM the hypervisors watchdog may have killed it
[01:16:10] <spiderman> it was on ec2
[01:16:39] <Cl0udNinja> yeah it may have killed it, but you'll probably never know
[01:16:48] <spiderman> when these boxes were set up, it was considered bad practice to configure swap files on VMs. Is THAT true?
[01:17:20] <spiderman> I feel like swap is a must-have, but boss man says it can degrade performance
[01:17:33] <spiderman> but like, if you're hitting swap.... performance is already gone
[01:17:34] <Cl0udNinja> I've never run into a case where I've used swap because I size my systems and configure my services properly so I dont eat up all the ram and cpu constantly

[01:30:06] <Shiromara> :)  we have both now.. i also researched why.. it was the config for a school program which wanted a path.. it doesn't do a path per user so they also split documents up to a folder redir

[03:34:01] <shibboleth> not exactly
[03:34:04] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> and they actually *did* block an OEM-SLP key several times through different methods
[03:34:09] <shibboleth> sp1 blocked the famous key

[03:34:16] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> SP1 blocked several, and that was it
[03:34:22] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> end of story, no more key blockings the entire history
[03:34:27] <shibboleth> sp2 blocked most of what keygens would spit out

[03:34:31] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> it did, overall, more harm than good
[03:34:45] <shibboleth> but WGA would actually verify with the mothership
[03:34:59] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> yea, in 2009 they blocked a slew of SLP keys from Lenovo and others

[03:35:40] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> i'm sure lenovo et all had a joy time with that
[03:36:10] <shibboleth> so, what ended up happening: ppl were running random ISOs of xp from gawd knows where, were afraid to run windows update because msft might drop some nagware on ya
[03:36:12] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> XP - ridiculously easy, any random key on google was pretty much good enough

[05:39:02] <shibboleth> iirc it'd leak fuel through the fuselage while on the ground/tarmac?
[05:39:06] <HurdyGurdyBurdy> yeah
[05:39:07] <hunterkll> the SR-71 yes
[05:39:17] <hunterkll> because the plates/tanking/fuselage sections gapped when cold
[05:39:20] <shibboleth> then the speed would make the metal expand and "not leak" while in flight
[05:39:31] <hunterkll> yep, then you do in-air refuelling before your actual sortie

[08:27:10] <Jay-Ros-NotAPie> it's usable

[08:28:31] <hunterkll> lower res, less than half the brightness, etc
[08:29:12] <hunterkll> sure, has the other input types you'd need for different work but if you're not doing that kind of thing...... it's a waste

[08:31:19] <hunterkll> that 17" is also sold by another formfactor - it's a 7RU monitor for racking

[08:33:00] <hunterkll> but that monitor only supports up to 6G SDI, so 4K @ 30fps only on those inputs 
[08:33:20] <hunterkll> need 24G-SDI for 8K @ 120fps which is barely available, and only as a draft standard
[08:34:00] <hunterkll> er, wait, that's only 8K @ 60, 4K @ 120

[08:35:58] <hunterkll> Apple's XDR skimps on other things too to get to that price: it's expected to be used with computer software, so things like waveform display are handled by software handling the i/o, unlike the sony w hich you'd use inline on something with remote control to view timecodes and such without a computer
[08:36:18] <hunterkll> but if all you're doing is using it attached to a computer/computer equipment, then it's stupidly hard to beaet that price
[08:37:14] <hunterkll> but i'd just get the vesa magnetic mount for $200 instead of that stand :P

[09:11:32] <SirSceptalot> Does the hypervisor instigate a manual sync or something?
[09:11:42] <xe0n> well the hypervisor can provide it, the os can get it, few ways
[09:11:46] <xe0n> why not check where it's source is coming from?
[09:12:29] <xe0n> and if the machine has just booted up it's going to check time from whatever source it's set to
[09:13:51] <Jay-Ros-NotAPie> SirSceptalot, I think it's not so much the snapshot going "ON > EYES CLOSED > TO DISK > RESTORE > ON"
[09:14:04] <Jay-Ros-NotAPie> it's more "SAVED STATE > DISK > SAVE STATE > ON

[09:22:39] <SirSceptalot> xe0n, it's a domain joined vm that should sync with our primary dc, as set by GPO. I just checked vmware docs to verify if timesync is pushed from the hypervisor, and that's a negative
[09:22:58] <SirSceptalot> so unless I'm missing something source should be ntp, taken from DC
[09:23:36] <CableNinja> this is likely some code within the kernel regarding suspend operations
[09:23:53] <CableNinja> the kernel probably requests the time from the hwclock at unsuspend to re-sync the time
[09:23:57] <SirSceptalot> AKCHUALLY, periodic time sync from hypervisor is disabled. It could be that it's still triggered on events such as snapshot restore. Or what CableNinja just said :p
[09:24:20] <xe0n> w32tm /query /status
[09:24:23] <xe0n> will tell you the time source
[09:24:32] <xe0n> and dont set ntp to clients via gpo, AD handles that by itself...
[09:24:50] <xe0n> just configure the ntp timesource for the dc holding the pdc fsmo
[09:25:02] <SirSceptalot> yup, source is dc
[09:25:08] <xe0n> there ya go
[09:26:08] <A-KO> SirSceptalot: with vmware, you have to go into the guest configuration (the vmx data) to turn off time sync on things like VM migrations, etc.
[09:26:13] <CableNinja> xe0n, even if there is a timesource, the kernel still has to keep time relatively well. a lot of shit would lose its mind if all of a sudden the system was 8 hours ahead of where it thought it was, thus the kernel hwclock sync at resume
[09:26:16] <SirSceptalot> xe0n, well that the dc was the source is expected. My point was that ntp only syncs periodically, and I've never seen a snapshot restore leaving a vm out of sync temporarily
[09:26:22] <A-KO> it will sync on guest startup, VM migrations, all by default
[09:26:23] <A-KO> snapshots
[09:26:24] <A-KO> all of it
[09:26:30] <A-KO> you have to turn all that shit off if you don't want it
[09:26:48] <CableNinja> computer time is the devil
[09:26:50] <SirSceptalot> I'm not turning anything off, I was just curious how it worked :p
[09:27:08] <A-KO> windows will keep pretty good time but things get fucky with dynamic migration of VMs based on workload, etc.
[09:27:10] <xe0n> CableNinja: im aware?
[09:27:11] <xe0n> lol
[09:27:12] <CableNinja> I fell down a rabbit hole of time once, because the company I was with was like 'we cant have more than 1ms of time drift across any of the systems'
[09:27:25] <xe0n> ntp > dc > clients
[09:27:28] <xe0n> stratum blah blah
[09:27:39] <A-KO> you can configure high accurate time in Windows 2016 and newer, and 2019 goes a bit further
[09:27:43] <A-KO> not sure if they did anything else in 2022
[09:27:44] <xe0n> ^
[09:27:50] <CableNinja> and I basically had to explain to them that crystals used in computers are very fickle fucking things and that even a .1 degree C change in ambient temperature can cause time drift
[09:28:03] <CableNinja> ended up having to make every system ntp sync every 30 seconds
[09:28:16] <A-KO> just enable highly accurate time fleetwide :D

[09:32:11] <Jay-Ros-NotAPie> You see... I was a pie for a while...
[09:32:35] <SirSceptalot> I find that difficult to believe
[09:32:35] <Jay-Ros-NotAPie> and bloody reset the bridge, and I'm in celebratory mode
[09:32:38] <CableNinja> but anyway.. yeah, fucking computer time can suck a bag of dicks. if you buy subpar motherboards you're more likely to get wild timedrift than others, but that can also depend on the batch of the fucking crystal oscillators and worse they arent even fucking totally the same in the same batch, you can get wild deviations to like 1000ppm in some cases

[09:34:54] <CableNinja> and even dumber still... if you shout at the can of the oscillator you can cause timedrift..
[09:35:03] <A-KO> alright time to hit the hay
[09:35:05] <SirSceptalittle> CableNinja, I never actually knew why time drift was such an issue. I thought I read somewhere that even el-cheapo casio watches were super duper accurate, factors more than the most expensive mechanical watches
[09:35:16] <Jay-Ros-NotAPie> CableNinja, I got that far in Skyrim
[09:35:52] <CableNinja> SirSceptalittle, they probably source super accurate oscillators (like within 10-20ppm)
[09:36:01] <xe0n> standalone machines sure set each client to do ntp sync, but domain joined should be getting it from the dc
[09:36:05] <CableNinja> when you buy in bulk its easy to get them cheap
[09:36:21] <CableNinja> Jay-Ros-NotAPie, I dont get it
[09:36:47] <CableNinja> xe0n, ah yeah these werent domain joined. that'd have been a nightmare

[09:37:01] <xe0n> lol
[09:37:07] <CableNinja> it would've made some shit easier, but overall would've made life shitty for the operators
[09:37:28] <CableNinja> we had to build a system that could be operated by a 7-11 employee essentially
[09:37:47] <CableNinja> that also meant debugging shit had to be stupid easy

[11:37:55] <lancehead> My supervisor wants to talk to me about it this afternoon :^) sitting here biting my nails 
[11:37:58] <lancehead> Nah, sleeping disorder 
[11:38:04] <SirSceptalot> ah
[11:38:09] <SirSceptalot> I'm not sure if that's better or worse
[11:38:16] <lancehead> I generally do fine but I have bad nights lol 
[11:38:18] <SirSceptalot> prolly worse, not being able to sleep sucks
[11:38:19] <CableNinja> am glad my bosses are understanding
[11:38:21] <lancehead> Ehh I'm used to it 
[11:38:31] <CableNinja> my bosses ask me why I'm not taking more time off
[11:38:44] <lancehead> Mine is as well, I'm pretty sure he'll understand. I'm an intern though so I'm expected to be here as much as I can 
[11:39:28] <SirSceptalot> CableNinja, your bosses are clearly malfunctioning
[11:39:34] <CableNinja> my boss told me on my first week "Babe Ruth it, Call your shot. Make your shot. Prove you made your shot. as long as you do that I dont care"
[11:39:44] <lancehead> It sucks because I got sick with flu last week, and now this. Missed 3 days in the past 2 weeks 
[11:39:48] <lancehead> Lol nice CableNinja
[11:40:13] <CableNinja> honestly, this is probably the first place I've been where I've been happy to work
[11:40:18] <lancehead> Well, last week technically. And 4 days; last wednesday to friday, and yesterday 
[11:40:50] <lancehead> I doubt I'll ever find a place where I'm *happy* to work but I'm definitely content with the place I'm working rn 
[11:41:26] <CableNinja> when I started here I figured it'd just be another job, but I actually like everyone I work with, and we're all equally nerdy and have similar senses of humor
[11:41:40] <lancehead> That's awesome :D most people at my workplace are a lot older than I am 
[11:42:02] *** Joins: n1ceAF (~n1ceAF@84.237.231.8)
[11:42:09] <CableNinja> before this job I was in super burnout, and my boss knew that going in so hes been super understanding if I'm just like 'I dont feel like workin today'
[11:42:48] <lancehead> Ahh that's cool. My dad had a burnout, then got placed in a call center through an employment agency 
[11:42:58] <lancehead> And they're coooonstantly breathing down his neck 
[11:43:04] <lancehead> Which has led him into a second one :d 
[11:43:07] <SirSceptalot> wtf lancehead
[11:43:21] <lancehead> ?
[11:43:29] <SirSceptalot> place someone with a burnout in a call center, what a clorious idea
[11:43:31] <n1ceAF> Hi guys! Anyone have experience with with host to subnet ipsec configuration using Fortigate?
[11:43:39] <lancehead> Yeah I know right 
[11:43:59] <SirSceptalot> s/clorious/glorious
[11:43:59] <CableNinja> I was in burnout for like 2 years. I decided to take some time off about 2 weeks before the pandemic and rode out last year living like hermit and not working
[11:43:59] <layer8> SirSceptalot meant: "place someone with a burnout in a call center, what a glorious idea"
[11:43:59] <lancehead> He is good at it. Gets his work done generally, but they're SUPER anal about call times and numbers 
[11:44:38] <n1ceAF> Problem is that I cant ssh into box unless I go into VM and ping something at subnet side
[11:44:41] <CableNinja> n1ceAF, not specifically fortigate but thats the general VPN process for everything
[11:44:51] <lancehead> Oh hey, on another note, any of you have experience with RPi hardening?

[11:45:21] <CableNinja> n1ceAF, so it only works after you cause an ARP on something vpn side?
[11:45:34] <SirSceptalot> CableNinja, how does a burnout work/feel in your opinion. Never had one, I find it hard to imagine. Someone from work here had/has one from like 10 years ago, and he's but a shell of who he used to be
[11:46:05] <SirSceptalot> doesn't work anymore, he's on permanent sick leave
[11:46:12] <n1ceAF> CableNinja it seems so
[11:46:12] <CableNinja> SirSceptalot, when you start calling into work and making up excuses, or you start putting in 4 hour days because you just cant anymore, or you get short with people for being dumbfucks, yeah thats burnout
[11:46:27] <xe0n> ^ pm
[11:46:44] <lancehead> Yeah I have all that down xe0n; as well as SSH security and internal hardening. These are Pi's that connect to a lot of other devices. I need those connections more secure 
[11:46:52] <lancehead> And a way to make sure they're not being spoofed or anything 
[11:47:02] <CableNinja> SirSceptalot, my first sign of burnout was snapping on the CEO of the company I worked at, because he decided that we *had* to implement a thing that was a really stupid thing, because of a stupid problem caused by stupid developers
[11:47:07] <lancehead> Which I have little experience with 
[11:47:12] <CableNinja> I let loose on the CEO, in a public forum
[11:47:19] <SirSceptalot> when he still worked here, the guys was a BEAST.then from one day to the next he just crashed. He said he couldn't even muster the energy to get out of bed, literally
[11:47:22] <CableNinja> and then promptly drove to the office and reamed him in person
[11:47:41] <SirSceptalot> damn
[11:47:45] <CableNinja> SirSceptalot, yeah thats burnout mode
[11:47:55] <lancehead> Yeah same with my dad. He used to be a high school teacher and had a LOT of fun in it, then one day he thought to himself "god I wanna throw this kid out a window" 
[11:48:03] <lancehead> And then immediately though "wait that's not right, what the hell?" 
[11:48:08] <lancehead> thought * 
[11:48:09] <CableNinja> tbh 8 hour days are too much
[11:48:35] <CableNinja> my peak is 6 hours solid work, with maybe 2 breaks at most
[11:49:01] <lancehead> Imagine working 8.5h with one half hour break, couldn't be me 
[11:49:04] <lancehead> >_>
[11:49:11] <CableNinja> thats why salary is win
[11:49:25] <CableNinja> but salary is also lose because you can be asked to put in 60 hour weeks
[11:49:39] <shibboleth> yeah, you're still getting the shit end of the stick
[11:49:43] <lancehead> heh. I get 300/month flat because I'm an intern 
[11:50:11] <shibboleth> crush the others: no incentive for them place you elsewhere
[11:50:27] <CableNinja> shibboleth, its all about workin the system
[11:50:32] <SirSceptalot> I worked my way up from manual labour in the factory to my position, but I still have my old.. eh.. dunno what it's called. I'm paid by the hour still
[11:50:53] <shibboleth> "dude closes 10x more tickets than the next guy" <--- yeah, they're not gonna wanna change that
[11:50:56] <CableNinja> hourly can be tops if you can manage to ensure you get 40+
[11:51:10] <CableNinja> shibboleth, thats why you never show your full potential :P
[11:51:33] <SirSceptalot> I make €22/hr. 38hr work week, overtime is paid less though, at €17.2/hr
[11:51:59] <SirSceptalot> €22/hr before taxes that is
[11:52:00] <lancehead> Damn, 40/h sounds like a myth to me as a student. I literally can't imagine making 1600/week 
[11:52:34] <CableNinja> also I dont find that to be the case shibboleth. every place I've worked, with the exception of maybe 2 or 3, I've been rewarded for going above/beyond. be it EOY bonuses, raises, or just in general being told 'you did good, go take some time off'
[11:52:41] <shibboleth> CableNinja, i lasted one/two months at first level. i closed more than twice as many tickets as the next guy, was getting "burnout"
[11:52:45] <lancehead> That's more than my girlfriend and I have combined in a month, currently o.O 
[11:53:46] <CableNinja> shibboleth, I know those feels. we had a shitty L1 who couldnt manage to navigate his way out of a paper bag that I basically started stealing tickets from because he couldnt handle them (even basic shit like reset users password on server X). I took so many he eventually got fired for having 0 ticket resolves for a month solid
[11:55:15] <shibboleth> so, towards the end i thought what the hell. in a single day: closed twice as many tickets as the next guy, processed twice as many repairs/installs and sold more new subs than the next guy whose job was actually sales
[11:55:32] <shibboleth> and i said: yeah, either gimme an office or i walk
[11:55:56] <CableNinja> lancehead, thats about average mid-senior sysadmin pay tbh
[11:56:11] <shibboleth> well, it had four walls, a door and a window
[11:56:13] <CableNinja> well, high end of it
[11:56:23] <shibboleth> so. at least some good came out of it
[11:56:43] <CableNinja> you did all that for an office?
[11:56:44] <CableNinja> fuck that
[11:56:49] <shibboleth> nah
[11:57:02] <shibboleth> i was getting sick and tired of 1st level
[11:57:22] <CableNinja> the nice thing about L1 is that you dont have to give a fuck
[11:57:39] <CableNinja> if you know your shit you can basically go full autopilot and save your energy for after work
[11:57:55] <shibboleth> and occasionally pissing off 2nd level by having to explain shit to them
[11:58:11] <CableNinja> no you never do that because people will know you know more shit
[11:58:23] <CableNinja> if its beyond L1 scope you dont do it and pass it on
[11:58:26] <shibboleth> so, either i move up or they're gonna gang up on you
[11:59:39] <CableNinja> I liked doin support, even L2/L3. most of the time it was easy stuff, and if it wasnt, it was enjoyable. plus set hours were always nice
[11:59:40] <SirSceptalot> I really never worked in such a structured company. How is L1/L2 defined?
[11:59:57] <shibboleth> SirSceptalot, 1st level: chimpanzees witha script
[11:59:59] <CableNinja> L1 is front-line support, they are the ones getting calls and tickets first, and generally fixing the dumb shit
[12:00:27] <CableNinja> L2 are people with some scripting and better troubleshooting skills that can work more complex problems that the general L1 cant solve through wikis and basic googling
[12:00:38] <shibboleth> 2nd level: well, at least they don't confuse the chassis and the hard drive of a pc
[12:00:40] <CableNinja> L3 are people who script, troubleshoot, and do complex project work
[12:01:33] <shibboleth> 3rd level: well. it would vary
[12:01:42] <Activ8> L1, help desk, L2, techs, L4 Engineers, L4 usually team leader L5 manager
[12:02:12] <CableNinja> you missed L#
[12:02:14] <CableNinja> L3*
[12:02:34] <CableNinja> L3 is also usually unfortunately on call

[12:03:15] <SirSceptalot> CableNinja, You said "if it's beyond L1 scope you don't do it and pass it on". Is there a clear definition of what is Ln or do you wing it?
[12:03:24] <CableNinja> it depends on the place
[12:03:47] <CableNinja> some places have very defined definitions, others its like 'if you personally cant solve it and no one else around you thats also an L1 cant solve it, escalate it'
[12:04:01] <SirSceptalot> ok, thanks for the info
[12:04:12] <lancehead> That's about how we work

[12:04:28] <lancehead> Also hi Activ8 
[12:04:50] <CableNinja> SirSceptalot, if you get the chance and arent beyond it already, datacenter / hosting support for places that have physical systems or colo is fun imo
[12:05:27] <SirSceptalot> I'm forever debating on what to do with my life, job wise
[12:05:37] <shibboleth> problem is, in an established org/system, once you move up you'll no longer be providing whatever metric was the basis for you moving up
[12:05:44] <SirSceptalot> I have kind of a nice thing here, but it has it's downsides

[12:06:11] <CableNinja> shibboleth, thats where good managers come in that can give you good metrics to improve on
[12:06:24] <CableNinja> there is always a limit to what you can learn in a single place
[12:06:36] <shibboleth> CableNinja, and then i'mma have to explain the concept of goodharts law to them
[12:07:01] <shibboleth> and like... watch them struggle with the idea
[12:07:44] <shibboleth> you know, that look a moose/deer might have right before you collide with one
[12:08:54] <CableNinja> yeah, again, good managers make the difference there. Like I said earlier, my boss told me as long as I do what I say I'm gonna do, all is good. when you get in the higher positions those kind of metrics that lower levels of support and shit have to deal with no longer apply anyway purely because the job you're doing isnt exactly the same
[12:09:34] <CableNinja> and if it is the same just more advanced you'll obviously have fewer stat points than the lower levels and that can be compensated for with statistics like LOE (level of effort) compared to number of items closed
[12:10:17] <shibboleth> you're assuming competent managers.

[12:18:23] <CableNinja> you have to pay to use the hardware
[12:18:43] <CableNinja> as in, you have to pay a licensing fee if you intend on including an SD* device on your own device
[12:18:48] <shibboleth> not that a usb flashdrive will be any better
[12:18:57] <shibboleth> also, no feasible method of ffde
[12:18:58] <lancehead> For SSH I was thinking to disallow root logins; change the default port; and use private keys as well as a password with fail2ban. Max 5 tries, 10 min lockout if failed 
[12:19:25] <CableNinja> lancehead, leave the port, security through obscurity isnt great
[12:19:34] <shibboleth> lancehead, well, that sounds impressive. in 1996
[12:19:55] <lancehead> Mmm fair. I'll propose it and if they don't want it, fair enough @ CableNinja 
[12:20:03] <CableNinja> and also afaik, password and key are exclusive, except when using a passworded key
[12:20:08] <lancehead> @shibboleth you're probably right; I *am* new to this after all 
[12:20:17] <lancehead> That's what I meant yeah, CableNinja. My bad 
[12:20:36] <shibboleth> well, if you're doing business-critical stuff on pis: you're likely doing it waaay wrong anyway

[12:21:54] <CableNinja> shibboleth, eh it really depends. if you assume a consumer level pi, sure, but they have the one thats like a ram chip slot on a system you build yourself, which is a whole different beast
[12:22:09] <lancehead> Yeah we use RevPi Core 3's 
[12:23:49] <shibboleth> no redundant storage, no feasible method of fde, all io = usb = not ideal
[12:24:49] <lancehead> In any other case I'd agree, but for a fuel pump I'd say it works well enough 
[12:25:53] <CableNinja> eh yeah I mean use what you need. dont need to go wild, and if the other devices are usb then it doesnt really matter

[12:34:27] <lancehead> Also shibboleth, keep in mind I'm only talking about the things I *know* when it comes to these Pi's, which isn't a lot. And you know even less than I do 
[12:34:39] <CableNinja> LOOOOL
[12:34:42] <lancehead> For all we know they're running absolutely perfectly and I'm just being given needless busywork 
[12:35:11] <lancehead> (Which might actually be the case; they have them running in about 8 countries without any serious issues) 
[12:35:49] <SirSceptalot> that's not to say shibboleth isn't right in principle though. You do want very reliable hardware in public stuff, and being sure stuff won't spark when pumping explosive fluids is preferable
[12:36:05] <CableNinja> I wish you could actually give more information like how the shits laid out and setup and shit without violating NDAs and shit. I'm curious how the whole thing is setup
[12:36:16] <xe0n> through a usb cable
[12:36:17] <xe0n> :P
[12:36:23] <lancehead> True, but I also have no idea what the inside of those pumps physically look like @SirSceptalot 
[12:36:23] <xe0n> they might need....a hub
[12:36:23] * CableNinja types network code faster
[12:36:25] <xe0n> of some sort
[12:36:26] <xe0n> :P
[12:36:34] * xe0n chucks CableNinja a beer
[12:36:34] <CableNinja> you *could* help you know... :P
[12:36:35] <xe0n> cheers!
[12:36:37] <lancehead> For all I know the Pi's are completely isolated and there's a single cable running out 
[12:36:40] <xe0n> i just did!
[12:36:41] <CableNinja> cheers
[12:36:42] <xe0n> i gave YOU fuelk
[12:36:44] <xe0n> fuel
[12:36:50] <CableNinja> but did you give me fire?
[12:36:54] <CableNinja> and that which i desire?
[12:37:00] * CableNinja HUHGAH's
[12:37:02] <xe0n> OOOHH YEAHHH
[12:37:03] <xe0n> LOL
[12:37:09] <lancehead> Lmaooo 
[12:37:19] <SirSceptalot> I mean, on one hand: if a spark from a 12V pi is enough to ignite the pump there might be a serious design flaw that no amount of controller hardware changes is going to fix
[12:37:23] <xe0n> p.s fuck lars
[12:37:31] <CableNinja> SirSceptalot, 20-40V*
[12:37:33] <lancehead> That's stuck in my head for the next 2 weeks now 
[12:37:37] <CableNinja> xe0n, agreed
[12:37:41] <SirSceptalot> OH MY GOD THAT'S DANGEROUS A.F.
[12:37:57] <CableNinja> SirSceptalot, google the RevPI Core 3
[12:38:05] <CableNinja> its the same thing I linked above
[12:38:09] <lancehead> Again, I have no idea how they actually physically look SirSceptalot. The pump that is 
[12:38:14] <CableNinja> but its meant for 20-40V op
[12:38:19] <lancehead> For all I know the Pi's are nowhere near the actual pumps 
[12:38:28] <CableNinja> they... would kinda have to be..
[12:38:34] <SirSceptalot> lol
[12:38:35] <CableNinja> USB is limited to 3m (15ft)
[12:39:00] <lancehead> They could be networked? Maybe? 
[12:39:02] <CableNinja> so its a bundle of network cables going back to the mdf
[12:39:09] <lancehead> I really don't know man lol 
[12:39:15] <CableNinja> heh yeah
[12:39:35] <CableNinja> like I said, I wish there was more of a layout and such just because I'm curious
[12:39:47] <lancehead> Honestly.. same LMAO 
[12:40:05] <CableNinja> well you work there you can ask for more info :P
[12:40:15] <CableNinja> you just cant go giving that info to us unfortunately lol
[12:40:20] <lancehead> I should be given it later when I actually have to implement stuff 
[12:40:29] <xe0n> curiosity killed the...CableNinja
[12:40:29] <xe0n> :P
[12:40:32] <lancehead> And when I do, I'll set a timer for two years so I can tell you after 
[12:40:44] <CableNinja> theres no harm in askin questions lancehead. being curious is an important part of being a sysadmin/devops imo
[12:40:49] <CableNinja> xe0n, yep, can confirm am dead
[12:40:57] *** CableNinja is now known as DeadNinja
[12:41:03] <lancehead> Yee, I'm a total noob and aware of it 
[12:41:13] <DeadNinja> please bury me with my ass up, near the ocean
[12:41:22] <lancehead> Ass sticking out of the sand? 
[12:41:31] <DeadNinja> yeah so the world can kiss my ass when I'm dead
[12:41:32] <shibboleth> SirSceptalot, on oil-rigs personal cellphones are out of the question
[12:41:35] <SirSceptalot> that's how you get zombie seals
[12:41:43] <lancehead> Do you also want a sign that says "free use" ? 
[12:41:54] <xe0n> oO
[12:41:55] <DeadNinja> lancehead, no, I'm not a cheap ho. $5 min
[12:41:59] <lancehead> lmao 
[12:42:02] <lancehead> lil collection bin 
[12:42:39] <lancehead> When my supervisor arrives later I'll ask him if the Pi's could technically blow the shit out of a neighborhood if they spark, shibboleth 
[12:42:45] <lancehead> But I think I know the answer
[12:42:47] <DeadNinja> shibboleth, you know what else they dont allow on oil rigs
[12:42:54] <lancehead> me
[12:42:59] <DeadNinja> fuckin. because you'll generate too much static and cause a fire
[12:43:04] <shibboleth> and a 30usd rpi powered by a 5usd chinese charger isn't any better
[12:43:12] <lancehead> LMAO Ninja 
[12:43:19] <SirSceptalot> shibboleth, at least here it's technically not allowed to use your cellphone when pumping gas either
[12:43:20] *** DeadNinja is now known as Cl0udNinja
[12:43:23] <Cl0udNinja> I have ascended
[12:43:36] <shibboleth> lancehead, also, you make it sound like all i'll need to pwn that hydrogen station is.... an sd reader?
[12:44:07] <Cl0udNinja> shibboleth, physical access is total access anyway, so its kept behind lock and key and tamper evident seal likely
[12:44:07] <lancehead> These are 250usd pi's, shibboleth >_> they're made for stuff like this 
[12:44:21] <lancehead> It is, Cl0udNinja. Several locks 
[12:44:22] <Cl0udNinja> especially because its fuel related and fuel shits heavily regulated and monitored
[12:44:35] <SirSceptalot> afaik, that's because of some incident where a cellphone was alledgedly the cause of a fire. Again afaik this was never even remotely proven but everyone got scared so they banned it, despite more evidence to the contrary than proving the claim
[12:44:45] <shibboleth> drill the lock, mess with the microsd, wait two hours and kaboom?
[12:45:00] <Cl0udNinja> SirSceptalot, yep. mythbusters also showed that
[12:45:13] <SirSceptalot> well there we go
[12:45:24] <SirSceptalot> maybe cellphones are banned on oil rigs for the same reason
[12:45:29] <Cl0udNinja> probably
[12:45:37] <shibboleth> leave the valve open, wait for a smoker or spark plug to cause hindenburg 2.0?
[12:45:43] <SirSceptalot> or maybe the workers there spent too much time watching porn on their cellphones
[12:45:51] <shibboleth> SirSceptalot, not ex-safe
[12:45:53] <Cl0udNinja> but theres a lot more voilatility on rigs than the gas pumps here
[12:46:08] <Cl0udNinja> shibboleth, that assumes thats the kind of control it even has to begin with
[12:46:16] <SirSceptalot> if you'd know my ex, you'd realise that nothing is ex-safe
[12:46:21] <Cl0udNinja> at best it controls some relays which you dont even need an sd reader to fuck it over
[12:46:34] <lancehead> I don't think these even use a microsd either. I think they have internal storage 
[12:46:36] <Cl0udNinja> or it reads a monitor from the pump itself that then triggers the relay
[12:46:41] <SirSceptalot> but yeah, I'm very willing to concede that oil rigs are quite a different environment from a gas pump
[12:46:43] <Cl0udNinja> lancehead, yeah that one I saw was internal
[12:46:48] <shibboleth> make the price-board go "all your base..." and five minutes later kaboom
[12:46:54] <Cl0udNinja> its eMMC, but it *did* have a port you could plug into and overwrite the software with
[12:47:12] <shibboleth> SirSceptalot, hydrogen is dangerous/volatile AF
[12:47:23] <SirSceptalot> a lot more volatile shit I would assume, and the consequences if something does catch fire are FAR greater
[12:47:26] <shibboleth> gasoline is... milk by comparison
[12:47:31] <Cl0udNinja> shibboleth, you and him arent even talking about the same fucking thing
[12:47:32] <Cl0udNinja> keep up man
[12:47:41] <lancehead> lmao
[12:48:17] <SirSceptalot> well we kind of are, we just need to sync up timewise :p
[12:48:36] <Cl0udNinja> lancehead, actually if you can figure out how often these things are updated, or if they are done once and never touched again, you might be able to talk them into making the upload happen at mfg and having them physical (Destructively) disable the emmc update port to prevent such things
[12:48:47] <Cl0udNinja> only down side is if they have a bug in them they are trashed without extra work
[12:49:03] <Cl0udNinja> bug in the software I mean
[12:49:09] <lancehead> They're done once and never touched again I'm pretty sure 
[12:49:23] <lancehead> They have them setup in different timezones all over the world and communicating to a central place 
[12:49:42] <lancehead> So if one of them doesn't have connection and can't update a package, it's useless until it does 
[12:49:52] <lancehead> They don't do automated updates 
[12:50:03] <Cl0udNinja> yeah I'd look at finding a way of disabling the emmc port after the update
[12:50:08] <Cl0udNinja> after the first install update I mean
[12:50:33] <Cl0udNinja> or if you can get them straight from the manufacturer, you can see if they can upload the software and destroy the mmc port for you
[12:51:04] <lancehead> Not a bad idea 
[12:51:17] <lancehead> The port disabling that is 
[12:51:20] <Cl0udNinja> if thats not feasible, you can have an extra step where you physically cut the trace on the pcb if they're visible (or cut the traces at the pins of the pi where they go)
[12:51:21] <lancehead> The manufacturer idea is ehhh 
[12:51:29] <Cl0udNinja> its pretty common
[12:51:42] <Cl0udNinja> but that depends on the mfg
[12:52:08] <Cl0udNinja> we do it at work with our systems, they upload the image we send them so that we dont have to handle the box before we ship it to the location
[12:52:49] <lancehead> I'll suggest it but if they're doing it differently now I doubt they'll want to start doing that, unfortunately 
[12:53:29] <xe0n> i'd just follow the standard process they've done for the others :P
[12:53:57] <lancehead> Yeah, planning to. I'll throw the port idea in the mix anyway, maybe they'll like it
[12:54:02] <lancehead> And if they don't, less work for me /shrug 
[12:54:49] <Cl0udNinja> hell I mean even slapping a tamper seal over the emmc port would at least give you some insight, but that assumes they're checked daily for tampering
[12:55:11] <lancehead> Yeah they're not, they're configured to just do their thing without much maintenance 
[12:55:38] <SirSceptalot> They're connected remotely right? Why not a case intrusion alarm?
[12:56:07] <shibboleth> lancehead, hydrogen is volatile and corrosive AF and using non-EX-components sounds like the premise of a tragic news.story out of zimbabwe. are you sure your boss/employer is even... insured?

[13:05:18] <SirSceptalot> I do not
[13:05:19] <Cl0udNinja> is it tells you when its gonna go full morning screen on you
[13:05:31] <Cl0udNinja> which also means it tells you how many hours of sleep youre about to not get
[13:05:56] <Cl0udNinja> "you're waking up in 7.5 hours", yeah you say that.. but am I really?
[13:06:13] <SirSceptalot> :p
[13:08:02] <shibboleth> and then you end up bein immune to pretty much every sleeping-med there is
[13:08:10] <shibboleth> like... other than morphine or whatever
[13:08:22] <Cl0udNinja> I just get super baked before bed, or stay up late tryin
[13:08:32] <SirSceptalot> I'm so happy to be a good sleeper
[13:08:33] <xe0n> LOL
[13:08:39] <shibboleth> weed is like speed for me
[13:08:42] <xe0n> i havent smoked in 7 weeks and my sleep is fucked
[13:08:49] <xe0n> i miss heavy sleep
[13:08:49] <xe0n> lol
[13:09:07] <Cl0udNinja> I have really weird dreams if I'm not at least a bit high when I go to bed
[13:09:12] <xe0n> yeah
[13:09:17] <xe0n> ive been having weird dreams not being high
[13:09:18] <xe0n> it sucks
[13:09:18] <xe0n> LOL
[13:09:22] <xe0n> i miss being high haha
[13:09:40] <lancehead> Imagine sleeping more than four hours a night
[13:09:42] <lancehead> Couldn't be me 
[13:09:51] <Cl0udNinja> the other night I had a dream that I was havin a threesome, and the other girl was like totally obviously fake moaning. I got up and just said 'fucking faker' and walked to the kitchen
[13:09:55] <SirSceptalot> Man, I'm basically snoring before my head hits the pillow
[13:10:04] <Cl0udNinja> I wasnt high enough clearly
[13:10:09] <xe0n> ++
[13:10:18] <xe0n> i think the vape has been making me have bad sleep i dunno
[13:10:33] <Cl0udNinja> its a different high I feel
[13:10:50] <xe0n> well im not getting high, that's my problem lol
[13:10:55] <Cl0udNinja> lol
[13:10:57] <Cl0udNinja> git gud
[13:11:02] <xe0n> well i dont have any!
[13:11:02] <xe0n> LOL
[13:11:14] <Cl0udNinja> lol
[13:11:21] <Cl0udNinja> I hit the weed shop like once a week
[13:11:25] <xe0n> supply dried up, cbf chasing, done that enough over the years
[13:11:28] <xe0n> NO WEED SHOP HERE
[13:11:33] <Cl0udNinja> bigsad
[13:12:12] <shibboleth> you know, drinking and getting stoned alone... could be bad, mmkay?
[13:12:25] <Cl0udNinja> idk what the fuck I'd even do with it initially, but I was considering stocking up and buying an ounce for the 2 months my dog isnt gonna be able to go in the car with me
[13:12:40] <SirSceptalot> oh right
[13:12:41] <Cl0udNinja> shibboleth, fuck that. I'm good company by myself
[13:12:45] <SirSceptalot> did you buy those doggy stairs?
[13:13:18] <Cl0udNinja> I bought a ramp for the house and ended up giving it to someone at work because he wouldnt use it even if I tried and i couldnt return it
[13:13:20] <shibboleth> dunno, i don't drink or smoke alone and can't really get stoned with others since it's like popeyes spinach for me as opposed to everyone else
[13:13:25] <Cl0udNinja> I got him to use the one for the car though
[13:13:28] <shibboleth> shibboleth, co-stoner from hell
[13:13:57] <lancehead> I do drink "alone" but I usually end up with friends in discord 
[13:14:02] <lancehead> Friends that are also shitfaced 
[13:14:05] <SirSceptalot> Cl0udNinja, where does he sleep now?
[13:14:11] <Cl0udNinja> wherever he wants lol
[13:14:26] <Cl0udNinja> bed, couch, floor, his bed, depends on his mood
[13:14:30] <lancehead> "The world is my oyster, and I sleep in oysters" - that guy, probably 
[13:14:45] <SirSceptalot> I thought he wasn't going to be able to get in the bed?
[13:14:53] <SirSceptalot> Oh, his surgery hasn't happened yet, has it?
[13:14:56] <Cl0udNinja> not yet
[13:15:11] <SirSceptalot> damn, when is it scheduled?
[13:15:12] <Cl0udNinja> I'm gonna drop the bed onto the floor when hes out for his surgery
[13:15:17] <Cl0udNinja> 2 weeks ish
[13:15:21] <lancehead> Surgery? What kind 
[13:15:25] <SirSceptalot> how is he in the meantime?
[13:15:26] <Cl0udNinja> knee surgery :(
[13:15:34] <lancehead> Ahh yikes. What for? 
[13:15:40] <xe0n> blew it out playing fetch
[13:15:45] <xe0n> went too hard
[13:15:47] <Cl0udNinja> pretty much
[13:16:04] <lancehead> Wait... playing fetch? 
[13:16:08] <Cl0udNinja> SirSceptalot, hes alright. I can see it bothers him when hes in the house, but when we're walking around it doesnt seem to bother him much
[13:16:17] <lancehead> Are we talking about a dog
[13:16:19] <Cl0udNinja> yeah
[13:16:23] <lancehead> I thought we were talking about a person
[13:16:25] <xe0n> a dawg
[13:16:25] <Cl0udNinja> lmao
[13:16:39] <shibboleth> xe0n, duh, that's why you use a boomerang
[13:16:42] <lancehead> Everything suddenly makes sense 
[13:16:43] <SirSceptalot> if it were a person I wouldn't care as much
[13:16:47] <Cl0udNinja> haha
[13:16:48] <lancehead> Lol Sceptalot 
[13:16:51] <shibboleth> hell, even the loincloth-ppl know that
[13:16:54] <lancehead> I'm getting a cat soon :D 
[13:17:00] <Cl0udNinja> my knee is also fucked, for what its worth
[13:17:09] <lancehead> Back and jaw for me 
[13:17:42] <shibboleth> like... from sucking a bag of dicks or getting beat up?
[13:17:42] <xe0n> there's a joke there
[13:17:42] <Cl0udNinja> its gonna be super weird not having him in the house for the weekend of his surgery
[13:17:59] <lancehead> From temporomandibular joint disorder, shibboleth 
[13:18:05] <lancehead> So from grinding my teeth while I sleep, essentially
[13:18:08] <Cl0udNinja> what the fuck
[13:18:12] <Cl0udNinja> I'm pretty sure you made that word up
[13:18:17] <shibboleth> sounds like a friend of dorothies
[13:18:20] <lancehead> And clenching my jaw too hard when stressed 
[13:18:24] <SirSceptalot> lancehead, good thing you don't sleep much then
[13:18:28] <lancehead> Nahh Cl0udNinja 
[13:18:36] <Cl0udNinja> I know I was kidding :P
[13:18:38] <lancehead> Lmao true SirSceptalot
[13:18:52] <lancehead> Actually it's just my jaw; my back pain is a consequence of it 
[13:19:05] <Cl0udNinja> I ground my teeth in my sleep to the point that I disintegrated my molars :D :(
[13:19:07] <lancehead> Although I do occasionally get my sciatic nerve stuck if I do too much heavy lifting 
[13:19:24] <lancehead> Sameee, my right front molar is completely rounded at this point 
[13:19:36] <shibboleth> lancehead, catch 22 for hookers. gonna be bad on either the back or the knees
[13:19:43] <Cl0udNinja> my back most one on both sides are gone
[13:19:43] <lancehead> lmaooo
[13:19:51] <teh_f4ll3n> morning, anthropoids
[13:19:57] <lancehead> Yikes Cl0ud :( 
[13:19:58] <Cl0udNinja> GREETINGS FELLOW MEATBAG
[13:20:03] <Cl0udNinja> ARE YOU BREATHING WELL TODAY?
[13:20:14] <lancehead> Greeting: Hello, meatbag. I am HK-47 
[13:20:46] *** Quits: Aoyagi_raventop (~yags@user/aoyagi) (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
[13:21:13] <lancehead> Definition: "Love" is making a shot to the knees of a target 120 kilometers away using an Aratech sniper rifle with a tri-light scope
[13:21:38] <lancehead> *please* tell me someone got this 
[13:21:41] <Cl0udNinja> man you'd basically have to be pointing at the sky to even try
[13:21:49] <lancehead> Not in star wars!
[13:22:04] <Cl0udNinja> oh yeah because *pew pew* lasers
[13:22:19] <lancehead> I imagine blasters aren't affected by wind, elevation, weather or humidity 
[13:22:25] <Cl0udNinja> also, I feel bad for the thousands of destroyed civilizations destroyed by stray fire from all those missed shots
[13:22:31] <lancehead> lol 
[13:22:33] <shibboleth> 120km at mach1->mach2?
[13:22:40] <shibboleth> yeah, you're gonna miss
[13:22:42] <teh_f4ll3n> KOTOR reference. got it
[13:22:46] <lancehead> Ayyy 
[13:22:53] <lancehead> Do you know the entire dialogue @ teh_f4ll3n
[13:22:53] <SirSceptalot> laserbeams drift down due to gravity as well
[13:22:54] <Cl0udNinja> wait.. are blasters laser or plasma?
[13:23:01] <SirSceptalot> just not very much
[13:23:03] <lancehead> Plasma I think 
[13:23:14] <Cl0udNinja> THEY SHOULD HAVE BULLET ARC THEN
[13:23:16] <teh_f4ll3n> lancehead, no, haven't played it THAT much
[13:23:28] <shibboleth> at that range you're gonna haveto factor in.. earth rotating and a bunch of stuff you can't predict
[13:23:41] <lancehead> In the rest of the dialogue he goes on to explain how it's love because it's two people achieving a singular purpose against statistically long odds 
[13:23:46] <lancehead> Which is funny because he's right
[13:23:52] <Cl0udNinja> brb calculating the direction for swinging a shot around the sun to hit you tomorrow
[13:23:52] <teh_f4ll3n> plasma should have drop. Laser should have dispersion
[13:24:04] <xe0n> science nerds
[13:24:05] <teh_f4ll3n> but space magic, so no
[13:24:43] <Cl0udNinja> teh_f4ll3n, right, though dispersion would be like... fuckall until you hit a few thousand AU because the vacuum of space
[13:25:05] <shibboleth> Cl0udNinja, 1000s of au?
[13:25:07] <Cl0udNinja> also how the fuck were lasers doing that much damage to shit.. the power requirements would be insane
[13:25:14] <Cl0udNinja> yes..
[13:25:20] <Cl0udNinja> 1AU = distance from sun to earth
[13:25:23] <shibboleth> diff in dispersion between venus and earth makes all the diff :)
[13:25:29] <shibboleth> yeah, i know
[13:25:40] <lancehead> Cl0ud was assuming it'd be in actual space I think 
[13:25:44] <Cl0udNinja> ^
[13:25:49] <SirSceptalot> that really depends on how the laser is focused
[13:25:51] <lancehead> We were talking planetside though
[13:26:05] <Cl0udNinja> oh planet side yeah I mean fuck atmosphere and dust
[13:26:11] <Cl0udNinja> good luck
[13:26:36] <lancehead> I love the dialogue this came from, such good character development 
[13:26:46] <lancehead> hunter-killer droid that understands love but has a flawed definition of it 
[13:26:48] <lancehead> 10/10 writing 
[13:26:49] <shibboleth> read up on will herschels experiment from 18-bow-and-arrow. he was able to calculated the total energy of the sun using a bucket, thermometer and an umbrella
[13:27:11] <shibboleth> turns out it's something like 400 million, million, million, million watts
[13:27:15] <shibboleth> per second
[13:27:32] <SirSceptalot> shibboleth, like we said earlier: hydrogen is potent :)
[13:27:37] <CptLuxx> so its one gibby fart
[13:27:40] <shibboleth> or 1 million times the US annual power consumption.
[13:27:42] <shibboleth> per second
[13:27:44] <lancehead> So what you're saying is 
[13:27:50] <lancehead> We need to start tapping directly into the sun
[13:27:58] <SirSceptalot> not it
[13:27:59] <Cl0udNinja> too bad the earth only gets like 1% of that
[13:28:07] <SirSceptalot> there, called it
[13:28:11] <shibboleth> not even 1
[13:28:13] <Cl0udNinja> NOSE GOES
[13:28:17] * Cl0udNinja touches his nose
[13:28:17] <SirSceptalot> I'm not going to be the one plugging a cable into the sun
[13:28:26] <lancehead> No no that'll be automated of course 
[13:28:51] <lancehead> And then, we turn north korea into one big jet engine because they're somewhat useless anyway 
[13:29:04] *** Quits: n1ceAF (~n1ceAF@84.237.231.8) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[13:29:06] <lancehead> And shoot earth into a new solar system 
[13:29:09] <lancehead> For shits and giggles 
[13:29:12] <Cl0udNinja> what? no, use the middle east, its on the equator so we wont really fuck our orbit
[13:29:19] <lancehead> Oh true, true 
[13:29:28] <lancehead> Goodbye Iran 
[13:29:31] <SirSceptalot> fun fact: there are theoretical possibilities for turning the sun into a giant engine that could move itself to a new location
[13:29:45] <Cl0udNinja> you mean gravity?
[13:29:46] <Cl0udNinja> :D
[13:29:53] <SirSceptalot> no
[13:30:02] <SirSceptalot> by using the solar winds
[13:30:15] <lancehead> There are also theoretical possibilities for a parralel universe where men have tits from birth, so I think we can all agree that possibilities don't mean a whole lot 
[13:30:17] <Cl0udNinja> like by reflecting the winds back against the sun??
[13:30:22] <Cl0udNinja> thats... weird
[13:30:28] <SirSceptalot> basically ya build a little doodad around the sun so all solar winds are deflected into a single direction
[13:30:31] <CptLuxx> wat am i reading
[13:30:37] <shibboleth> anyone know the definition of "daylight"? it's while your neck of the woods is being blasted with the equivalent of 160w of sunlight per square meter per 24h
[13:31:05] <Cl0udNinja> stop reading from google
[13:31:08] <SirSceptalot> that seems unreasonable low
[13:31:14] <lancehead> Anyone know the definition of "horny"? It's me.
[13:31:24] <shibboleth> SirSceptalot, not everyone lives in arizona
[13:31:25] <SirSceptalot> that seems unreasonably low
[13:31:39] <lancehead> That's what she said?...
[13:31:42] <lancehead> :( 
[13:31:43] <SirSceptalot> neither do I, but 160w/m²/24h?
[13:31:59] <shibboleth> yeah, last part is kinda counter-intuitive
[13:32:14] <Cl0udNinja> yeah that seems really low
[13:32:19] <SirSceptalot> wait
[13:32:24] <shibboleth> you don't get really get 24h of daylight
[13:32:24] <SirSceptalot> that's dumb
[13:32:30] <SirSceptalot> watt over time is watthour
[13:32:43] <Cl0udNinja> so its really 160W/m2/12h
[13:32:44] <Cl0udNinja> but still
[13:32:48] <Cl0udNinja> thats not a lot
[13:32:51] <SirSceptalot> so what is really is must be an average of 160w/m²
[13:32:58] <shibboleth> more likely that each m2 is getting hit on average with 160w per 24h
[13:33:02] <SirSceptalot> and WTF
[13:33:14] <SirSceptalot> why would you say that it's DAYlight over a period of 24h?
[13:33:21] <Cl0udNinja> lol
[13:33:26] <shibboleth> <shibboleth> yeah, last part is kinda counter-intuitive
[13:33:26] <SirSceptalot> is this a defeinition for the fucking north pole?
[13:33:28] <shibboleth> <shibboleth> you don't get really get 24h of daylight
[13:33:29] <lancehead> Ohhh man I just got really tired out of nowhere
[13:33:31] * Cl0udNinja waits for SirSceptalot's brain to implode
[13:33:52] <lancehead> Do you guys ever get that? Where you're reading something and suddenly just dip into exhaustion 
[13:33:55] <lancehead> And then dissociate super hard 
[13:33:59] <Cl0udNinja> SirSceptalot, it makes sense, but its stupid
[13:34:07] <SirSceptalot> so
[13:34:26] <SirSceptalot> if there's a full moon, the day can be darker but still be daylight
[13:34:28] <SirSceptalot> or something
[13:34:38] <Cl0udNinja> in any 24 hour period, a 1 m^2 area gets 160W, meaning, in 12 hours of full sunlight (a half 24 hours, thus whole DAY) gives you about 160W
[13:35:02] <Cl0udNinja> the reflection from the moon does not give off enough energy to be counted
[13:35:06] <lancehead> math is hard 
[13:35:16] <shibboleth> so, on average 160w per 24h?
[13:35:21] <SirSceptalot> but it can't give 160W can it? Watt is a measure of power
[13:35:32] <SirSceptalot> when you add time, it needs to be a measure of energy, so watthour
[13:35:34] <lancehead> e=mc2
[13:35:43] <lancehead> 9+10=21
[13:35:50] <SirSceptalot> an AVERAGE of 160W is fine
[13:36:01] <Cl0udNinja> SirSceptalot, yeah thats why I told him to stop reading from google
[13:36:36] <SirSceptalot> but yeah, in a sense I guess it does make sense because you need to account for various length of day
[13:36:58] <Cl0udNinja> the length of day never changes, anywhere
[13:36:59] <Cl0udNinja> its 12 hours
[13:37:03] <SirSceptalot> why would this definition even exist
[13:37:06] <Cl0udNinja> lol
[13:37:07] <SirSceptalot> WAT
[13:37:14] <shibboleth> Cl0udNinja, riiiight
[13:37:19] <shibboleth> ever heard of the artic circle?
[13:37:21] <SirSceptalot> the fuck do you mean the lenth of day never changes
[13:37:25] <shibboleth> an what happens above it?
[13:37:37] <Cl0udNinja> shibboleth, edge cases, prove it and file a ticket :P
[13:37:43] <lancehead> lol
[13:37:50] <shibboleth> in winter: 24h nights, summer: 4h days
[13:37:55] <shibboleth> depending on latitude
[13:38:00] <shibboleth> 24h days
[13:38:14] <lancehead> I'd love a 24h night right now 
[13:38:18] <Cl0udNinja> at any given time, half of the earth is facing the sun
[13:38:20] <lancehead> I need some goddamn sleep
[13:38:29] <Cl0udNinja> the length of day never changes
[13:38:48] <shibboleth> trust me, it's quite the mindfuck for southerners
[13:38:52] <Cl0udNinja> DAYLIGHT changes
[13:38:56] <Cl0udNinja> but the length of a day does not
[13:39:09] <shibboleth> at first you can't sleep because of constant daylight
[13:39:18] <shibboleth> and then you're sleepy AF bc of constant night
[13:39:28] <lancehead> jokes on you i'm always sleepy AF 
[13:39:29] <lancehead> sign me up 
[13:39:38] <CptLuxx> uh the length of the day changes..
[13:39:48] <shibboleth> lancehead, add a brisk -30C and bobs your uncle, eh
[13:39:54] <Cl0udNinja> IT DOESNT MAGICALLY ADD AN EXTRA HOUR
[13:39:56] <lancehead> Exactly 
[13:39:59] <lancehead> Bob is my uncle 
[13:40:12] <lancehead> Actually no his name is vincent 
[13:40:23] <thegodsquirrel> Today's prediction: 24 hours, 0 minutes, 0.0006236 seconds (0.6236 milliseconds)
[13:40:23] <thegodsquirrel> Yesterday's prediction: 24 hours, 0 minutes, 0.0008010 seconds (0.8010 milliseconds)
[13:40:27] <Cl0udNinja> but have you ever helped your uncle JAck off a horse?
[13:40:30] <thegodsquirrel> ^^length of day
[13:41:03] <thegodsquirrel> If there are PREDICTIONS, a day is variable in length
[13:41:15] <Cl0udNinja> thegodsquirrel, oh no, at that rate, it will only take.... a few million years to stop rotating.. WHAT DO WE DO
[13:41:18] <lancehead> 1.5h left to my break hngg 
[13:41:30] <Cl0udNinja> also thats why we have leap seconds and leap years
[13:41:41] <shibboleth> lancehead, at -30 you're basically trying to walk/move without rubbing against your own clothes
[13:41:44] <thegodsquirrel> xD Cl0udNinja 
[13:41:45] <Cl0udNinja> oh god we've started talking about time again
[13:41:48] <lancehead> Guys, I need advice 
[13:41:51] <shibboleth> also, iirc -30c is rougly the same as -30f
[13:41:53] <Cl0udNinja> xe0n, please send help I think I'm stuck in a time loop
[13:42:10] <lancehead> Nah shibboleth 
[13:42:13] <lancehead> -30c is -22f 
[13:42:15] <shibboleth> -34
[13:42:22] <thegodsquirrel> fuck -22
[13:42:38] <lancehead> And -34c is -29f lol
[13:42:43] <Cl0udNinja> coldest I've dealt with was -32C before windchill, and the wind was blowing the snow sideways
[13:43:21] <lancehead> Okay so 
[13:43:33] <lancehead> Do I get coffee and die entirely later, or do I try to power through and die slowly throughout the day
[13:43:43] <Cl0udNinja> coffee
[13:43:48] <lancehead> deal brb
[13:43:48] *** Joins: GWM-Deus (~GWM@user/gwm)
[13:43:50] <Cl0udNinja> you can die when you're dead

[13:44:23] <shibboleth> Cl0udNinja, at those temps both gasoline and diesel will gel
[13:44:37] <Cl0udNinja> yep, they kept the busses running constantly
[13:44:43] <shibboleth> so better have a garage
[13:44:56] <Cl0udNinja> I couldnt even make it out for a smoke. I hit the first set of double doors and turned around
[13:45:48] <lancehead> am back with coffee
[13:46:11] <BWMerlin> I don't think this bug is going to get fixed anytime soon https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=52052

[13:47:55] <xe0n> oO
[13:47:57] <teh_f4ll3n> guys, can anyone recommend a good softphone client?
[13:47:58] <xe0n> err it has? https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/all/#product-desktop-release
[13:47:59] <xe0n> lol
[13:48:24] <xe0n> teh_f4ll3n: depends on your sbc\pbx
[13:48:31] <xe0n> whatever they support probably need to use
[13:48:34] <Cl0udNinja> alright, I'm off to try and get some sleep
[13:48:53] <teh_f4ll3n> web-based sip service
[13:48:53] <BWMerlin> 3CX has an android app if that is what you are asking
[13:49:01] <SirSceptalot> Good luck, good night, and good sexual fantasies where girls don't fake their moans Cl0udNinja 
[13:49:06] <teh_f4ll3n> nah, need a desktop one
[13:49:07] <Cl0udNinja> lol
[13:49:08] <Cl0udNinja> thanks
[13:49:18] <shibboleth> and now his watch has ended
[13:49:28] <teh_f4ll3n> I'm getting rid of the desk phone
[13:49:31] <shibboleth> and winter is coming
[13:49:43] <xe0n> you'll need to see what your provider\pbx\sbc supports? haha
[13:50:10] <BWMerlin> ^
[13:50:10] <shibboleth> ok, maybe straya is the exception to the stark motto
[13:50:40] <xe0n> does the sip service support direct routing? if so teams is a good one shrug
[13:50:45] <teh_f4ll3n> I tried several and they all worked, I just didn't like the client features (lack of)
[13:50:52] <xe0n> i use teams as a soft phone and i have a handset with teams on it lol
[13:51:23] <BWMerlin> seamonkey and firefox are two different things
[13:51:38] <teh_f4ll3n> they have their own softphone, but it's a pile of crap

[13:52:06] <BWMerlin> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SeaMonkey#Components
[13:52:34] <xe0n> well what are you after in a soft phone?
[13:52:42] <xe0n> transfer, hold, pick up, contacts?
[13:52:45] <xe0n> voicemail
[13:52:52] <SirSceptalot> there are handsets with teams on them?
[13:52:56] <xe0n> yup
[13:52:59] <xe0n> i got a poly one
[13:53:02] <xe0n> ccx500 or something?
[13:53:09] <shibboleth> xe0n, still, sharks with friggin lasers in the shitter, 1 million ways to die of natural causes and both trees on the entire continent being on fire must be a mixed bad
[13:53:27] <lancehead> What am I after in a soft phone? Not having one
[13:53:34] <SirSceptalot> oh, it's a desktop thing. Figured "handset" meant a portable device
[13:53:40] <SirSceptalot> still, didn't know that existed
[13:53:47] <xe0n> https://www.poly.com/au/en/products/phones/ccx/ccx-500
[13:53:53] <xe0n> well i have teams on my phone?
[13:53:56] <xe0n> lol
[13:54:10] <BWMerlin> I might give seamonkey a shot oneday
[13:54:17] <lancehead> fancy 
[13:54:24] <lancehead> The phone, that is 
[13:55:10] <SirSceptalot> neat
[13:55:20] <xe0n> yeah its useful for speaker phone if im working on a problem or something
[13:55:40] <teh_f4ll3n> mute, hold, transfer, conference at the very least, xe0n
[13:55:40] <xe0n> i tend to answer calls with my headset and soft phone, but if P1 or something stupid is going on, easier to have a speaker phone and yeah

[16:24:10] <JollyRgrs> ATI used to have a reall good convention for a time
[16:24:18] <JollyRgrs> the first digit was the HW level of DX
[16:24:31] <JollyRgrs> the 2nd digit was how much the HW pulls for DX
[16:24:33] <lancehead> Or Sony. Who the fuck calls their flagship wireless headphones "WH1000XM4" and then has shitty IEMs with THE EXACT SAME GODDAMN NAME 
[16:24:39] <teh_f4ll3n> the problem is, for non-IT people higher number seems like a better processor
[16:24:43] <SirSceptalot> while you're at it, tell the USB group to stop changing their shit too
[16:24:57] <JollyRgrs> i.g. 9800 Pro did nearly all the DX stuff it could on the HW, while the 9200 barely supported DX 9 on the HW side

[21:27:07] <thegodsquirrel> Some level of archival purposes...I dunno
[21:27:20] <hunterkll> thegodsquirrel, for servers we use task sequence based imaging so..... 2012, 2012 R2, 2016, 2019, and 2022 we just click "image" bsaically and it does it dynamically
[21:27:26] <hunterkll> it's all packages and steps in SCCM

[21:29:22] <thegodsquirrel> hunterkll That's really cool, I have never worked at that scale before, where I was before we set up a WDS with images for everything that lives in the deployment server till we replaced/deleted
[21:29:39] <hunterkll> i mean
[21:29:43] <hunterkll> that's the same principle 
[21:29:51] <hunterkll> you can make app packages for WDS and update those
[21:29:55] <hunterkll> instead of putting them in the images
[21:30:00] <hunterkll> so next image after package update gets latest 
[21:30:07] <hunterkll> instead of regenerating and handing out ISOs
[21:30:19] <thegodsquirrel> Yeah, we just sysprep'd and did that whole thing, but I know its old hat now
[21:30:29] <hunterkll> or doing the devil's technique of fucking idiotic sysprep'd images all prestaged

[21:31:10] <thegodsquirrel> But we had like 6 images...

[21:31:35] <hunterkll> but even fat images in the XP/2K3 days if you had SMS (which became SCCM) it was old hat :P

[21:32:10] <thegodsquirrel> It was an inherited mess that I cleaned up to a sane level
[21:32:17] <hunterkll> can't fault that
[21:32:48] <thegodsquirrel> The previous guy had 40 usb sticks with stuff on them and did everything by hand or acronis or something like that I can't remember
[21:33:01] <hunterkll> I think ghost finally got updated/caught up to the future in 2015
[21:33:07] <hunterkll> before then it was basically fixed in time with 2.5 
[21:33:12] <hunterkll> jesus
[21:33:24] <hunterkll> I mean, at that point, a fat image just to get shit moving is worth *something*
[21:33:51] <hunterkll> Heh, I didn't know ghost got driver injection in 2008

[22:07:23] <hunterkll> and the RODC is gonna need hella access to your DCs, but you can secure that by saying "172.x.x.69 can only talk over DC ports to the DCs"
[22:07:39] <hunterkll> so they'd have to compromise the RODC and use lifted credsd and shit to pivot around

[22:08:12] <hunterkll> there's many types of attacks an RODC still enables, but either way 
[22:08:41] <hunterkll> it does minimize attack surface/vectors

[22:09:12] <sd> 09<M​aster_ControlFlow> I can handle that though since its flowing through my Palo?

[22:11:41] <hunterkll> at least for the RODC, you're gonna want to be straight up classic firewall rules
