[01:01:11] <dob1> ah
[01:01:28] <dob1> nice
[01:02:06] <jinsun> would have to be x.strip() in the if condition too I guess

[01:02:32] <grym> '  ' is not empty
[01:02:46] <dob1> ok my bad, blank string

[01:03:04] <grym> (as well)
[01:03:08] <dob1> yes, right. thanks

[08:38:01] <Linkandzelda> but, what im looking for in the data is the first half to increase by 30% of the range, and the last half to increase by 70% of the remaining range. so if the numbers look like that, then thats in line with what i want
[08:38:55] <Linkandzelda> those figures are just estimates, since its not exactly 30%. maybe i'd like it better if it was 40%, or 35%. but cant know until i make that function to play with the factor in question...

[12:39:51] <ChrisWarrick> blei: moving all imports to another package isn’t an issue of flat vs nested; moving all imports would be confusing, difficult to search for in docs, and you could mix names from different modules

[18:47:54] <MrNaz> ok so i have a python script that is multithreaded using the multiprocessing module. i'm running eg 4 threads, and it's working fine. however, the last "block" of threads doesn't return all the results. i suspect that my loop is ending before all threads have returned a result. can anyone help me? here's the code:

[18:52:24] *** Joins: segfaultbanana (~segfaultb@user/segfaultbanana)
[18:52:45] <nedbat> MrNaz: your "p.join" is only going to join the last process created. you need to keep a list of all of them.
[18:53:05] <MrNaz> if i have eg 15 processes
[18:53:10] <MrNaz> 1-12 return fine
[18:53:37] <MrNaz> but 13, 14, 15 will usually be missing one or two
[18:53:40] <MmeQuignon> +1, you're using "join" outside of the scope, p is then defined as the last created process. The only one you're waiting for.

[18:57:58] <MmeQuignon> I think you should define a function which will both create the process and call "join" on it.
[18:58:12] <nedbat> MrNaz: before the loop:  `procs = []`

[21:51:06] <taeaad> Those are not fundamental issues; I would say it makes sense that they are issues. Python is pass-by-sharing and thus data.copy() makes sense if you are not sharing something. A view is thus just shared objects in the normal Python sense.
