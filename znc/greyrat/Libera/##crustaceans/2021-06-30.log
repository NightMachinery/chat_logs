[00:01:26] <geoffwozniak> A specialized thing to represent what is known about the use of a register
[00:02:42] <geoffwozniak> It has various binary operators defined on it, which are tested exhaustively, hence the large number of tests
[00:06:49] <geoffwozniak> Technically, it describes the definition(s) of a value found in a register

[00:36:47] <Brekkjern> Jesus christ, geoffwozniak. That is a lot of tests...
[00:36:58] <Brekkjern> How many are in the code base in total?
[00:37:30] <cb> geoffwozniak: not a good number
[00:37:35] <cb> delete or add some more
[00:40:49] <geoffwozniak> to be fair, most of them are hidden behind preprocessor macros
[00:44:04] <geoffwozniak> Brekkjern: GCC contains no unit tests, to my knowledge
[00:44:27] <geoffwozniak> As for integration tests, there are tens of thousands
[00:44:35] <riv> lol
[00:44:38] <riv> what was the rationale for this
[00:44:53] <riv> "hey what if we don't do ANY unit tests?" "Great idea!"
[00:44:54] <geoffwozniak> The code base is 30 years old
[00:45:02] <Brekkjern> I guess because there are so many things that are undefined and depends on the architecture?
[00:45:04] <ngoldbaum> aiui, if gcc were more modular it would be easy to stick proprietary plugins in
[00:45:14] <riv> oh yeah it's intentionally not modular isn't it
[00:45:14] <ngoldbaum> so they purposely don’t do that
[00:45:59] <geoffwozniak> A lot of what you would want to unit test is very hard to do so because of a) global state and b) build complexity
[00:46:23] <geoffwozniak> The C++ libs might have some unit tests.  I'm not sure.
[00:46:27] <ngoldbaum> does llvm have unit tests?
[00:46:36] <geoffwozniak> Yes, for some of its core stuff
[00:47:07] <geoffwozniak> When you test a compiler pass, you are rarely to never going to test it in isolation anyway
[00:47:28] <geoffwozniak> But LLVM is a lot easier because the IR can be read/written as its own format
[00:47:46] <geoffwozniak> GCC can't do that, so you basically have to test the whole compiler
[00:50:29] <indigo> Not modular you say? Time to split GCC into microservices
[01:04:07] <Church> alyx: That post has been surprisingly tame so far

[01:16:23] <mouseghost> geoffwozniak, 1488 tests?

[14:23:58] <pja> I’ve signed up for co-pilot. Definitely going to try some posix related prompts to see what happens!
[14:24:17] <Geekingfrog> :D
[14:24:19] <Brekkjern> Good luck :)
[14:24:20] <pja> (They haven’t let me in yet; I’m on the waitlist.)
[14:24:20] <Geekingfrog> that would be hilarious
[14:24:32] <Brekkjern> I wonder if you have to use the same language?
[14:25:09] <pja> Maybe. IIRC if you feed the right prompts to these large NNs you can often exfiltrate training set data from them.
[14:25:23] <Brekkjern> Yeah
[14:26:01] <Brekkjern> Most of my strings are stored in hardcoded lists, so depending on how it's trained you might need the list parts to trigger the completion
[14:26:06] <Brekkjern> But I dunno tbh

[16:58:38] <hoistbypetard> quite apart from quality concerns, reading up on this makes me think it's a very likely license violation waiting to happen.
[16:58:41] <hoistbypetard> > Once, GitHub Copilot suggested starting an empty file with something it had even seen more than a whopping 700,000 different times during training -- that was the GNU General Public License.
[16:59:15] <hoistbypetard> ^^^ (from https://docs.github.com/en/github/copilot/research-recitation ) - they are telling us this has been trained on lots of GPL code
[16:59:16] <buttsbot> Research recitation - GitHub Docs
[16:59:34] <hoistbypetard> hard to see how what it generates is not a derivative work of that.
[17:00:39] <Brekkjern> Yeah. It's pretty cool, but I don't think it's gonna work from a licensing perspective :P
[17:01:19] <Brekkjern> There's probably been a few lawyers looking at this, but I think it's likely they haven't really understood what's going on

[17:36:06] <geoffwozniak> The reams of shitty code are only going to increase as a result of this
[17:36:12] <hoistbypetard> i don't think the code even has to be on gh... any recent code, written in VS code with this service attached to it.
[17:37:07] <companion_cube> you think it also uploads your code?
[17:37:16] <companion_cube> it doesn't know if it's public, so I doubt it
[17:37:30] <hoistbypetard> no...
[17:37:36] <companion_cube> anyway, the problem is that this is going to generate even more code, with less reviewing
[17:37:45] <companion_cube> you can literally commit code that no human being has even read
[17:38:08] <hoistbypetard> i think it suggests completions to you in your editor based on a corpus of things it's learned by scraping code off github. you choose where/whether to upload it.
[17:38:17] <hoistbypetard> you could put it in 'lab or even sourcehut
[17:38:42] <hoistbypetard> or even an internal repo... this thing could taint code anywhere that allows vs code :)

[20:54:00] <jlindgren> next tuesday I'm blocked all day...so I took PTO on that day to wreak havoc
[21:17:21] <indigo> LOL
[21:19:35] <jlindgren> we have a scrum master/agile coach/whatever non-technical PM are called that is OBSESSED with agile, like following it to the book. so lord knows if we miss our backlog grooming on monday it'll throw everything off, so like we have 4hrs straight of grooming+planning tuesday morning...screw that
[21:20:03] <Geekingfrog> I see you're not really a team player, shame on you

[21:20:53] <Geekingfrog> I really like the idea of strategic time off to maximise chaos, I should do that.
[21:21:22] <companion_cube> what is backlog grooming?
[21:21:33] <Xe> a fucking chore

[21:24:48] <indigo> ^ the scrum process
[21:27:10] <jlindgren> companion_cube: its more like "lets just ignore all these bugs, only prioritize feature work again. but if we ever do get time allotted to work on bugs, these are the order we'd take care of them in"
[21:27:25] <jlindgren> i wouldn't mind it if it was like once a month but we do it bi-weekly. way too often.
[21:28:30] <indigo> Looks like the bugs aren't that important to the business!
[21:28:35] <jlindgren> absolutely fucking not
[21:29:05] <indigo> I remember one of the criteria on the Joel Test is "Do you fix bugs before writing new code?"
[21:29:14] <indigo> I think that question is a little naive TBH
[21:29:49] <indigo> It all depends on bug priority
[21:30:29] <Geekingfrog> I'm always told that's because I don't communicate well enough, and don't speak the right language to prioritise bugs. Like I don't know how to make their (potential) impact visible and tangible enough
[21:30:46] <jlindgren> yeah - high priority bugs will obviously get fixed, but all the low profile ones (that we aren't allowed to add any story points to because apparently in some incantations of agile bugs dont count toward velocity) just languish forever.
[21:33:11] <indigo> I think that's fine. Maybe they're just not that important in the end :-)

[21:49:02] <jlindgren> the PM will also do the classic thing of saying "story points do not account for time", then 5 minutes later send a website to calculate how much story points to say based on how much time...its almost like agile people have to instinctively say the time piece
[21:49:09] <jlindgren> I am ranting at this point though, and I apologize.
[21:49:22] * Geekingfrog likes rant
[21:51:47] <jlindgren> all i can say is if your company does semi-agile (like scrum, and thats it) thats such a blessing. that was us until about 6 months ago then we got the PM and all of a sudden we have backlog grooming, pre-planning before planning, retrospective, etc
[21:52:12] <jlindgren> pre-planning so we can plan for what we're gonna plan in the planning meeting...its basically mini-backlog grooming. but totally different. yes totally different.
[21:52:36] <Geekingfrog> the pre-planning seems a bit over the top yes
[21:53:38] <jlindgren> agreed. the others are semi-ok most of the time i just bitch becasue I'd rather do real work than sit in meetings
[21:53:56] <jlindgren> we moved our retro to every other sprint (4 weeks) and that isn't too bad tbh.
[21:54:02] <Geekingfrog> we have a similar problem here, soooo many meetings all the time, and nothing gets done
[21:54:34] <Geekingfrog> because we have to constantly improve processes, refine things, do retro on all the things, have 1-1 meetings with many people
[21:54:34] <jlindgren> do you h ave daily standups? if so do they last 15m or less?
[21:54:48] <Geekingfrog> around 10 min, sometimes 15 but it's rare
[21:54:49] <companion_cube> I have one every morning, typically <15 min indeed
[21:55:25] <Geekingfrog> I'm usually at the helm, and I'm rather ruthless when it starts to get derailed
[21:55:30] <companion_cube> > pre planning
[21:55:36] <companion_cube> why is that a thing
[21:55:38] <companion_cube> ever
[21:55:42] <Geekingfrog> planning the planning session :D
[21:55:58] <Geekingfrog> I'm a fan
[21:56:00] <companion_cube> wait, your job tries to improve process Geekingfrog ?
[21:56:07] <companion_cube> I thought  they didn't even bother improving the code
[21:56:17] <Geekingfrog> yes, we're expected to contribute to the way we work and interact with the other teams
[21:56:30] <jlindgren> ours is usually right at 15m, but a l ot of times goes longer like 45m. sucks.
[21:56:31] <Geekingfrog> code is not important, but culture and processes are paramount
[21:56:36] <jlindgren> thats cool Geekingfrog
[21:56:45] <jlindgren> does it get in the way sometimes?
[21:56:47] <companion_cube> "cc here's the code kthbye" is the best interaction
[21:57:08] <Geekingfrog> we have sooo many meetings that we have barely any time to get work done
[21:57:19] <companion_cube> :DDDD damn
[22:00:04] <Geekingfrog> my favorite was our PM suggesting we do a retro for the previous quarter, 2 days after we did a retro for the big project which took the entire said quarter
[22:00:24] <Geekingfrog> "what do you want to talk about? The big project we just discussed 2 days ago?"
[22:01:26] <jlindgren> holy hell would need some scotch after a meeting like that
[22:02:19] <companion_cube> Geekingfrog: "I'd like to talk about production issues and code quality"
[22:03:37] <Geekingfrog> nah, these are BAU, we somewhat track how many hours are wasted each weeks on that, but it's always insignificant compared to all the $$$ that <new feature> will bring
