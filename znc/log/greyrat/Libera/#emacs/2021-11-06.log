[01:05:21] <bpalmer> so there might be a way to get what you want, one way or another.
[01:05:56] <acdw> oh, that is a good spot to look. i'm even eschewing the pulsing thing --- so yes that's a great idea. thanks again!

[05:55:54] <danielsousaio> related to this topic, I've created a .dir-locals.el in my dotfiles directory that changes the magit-git-global-arguments to include the correct working tree. this works great when running M-x magit-status, but ignores it when staging a file (magit-stage)
[05:56:35] <danielsousaio> are bare repositories supported on Magit at all, or I'm just trying to hack around it?
[05:56:57] <FubbiQuantz> I was able to create a normal git repository without any apparent problems. I've already linked it up with github. To make sure nothing bad happened, I ran M-x prelude-update after I created the repository. I think everything worked out fine.
[05:57:07] <FubbiQuantz> Thank you for your help, everyone!
[05:58:05] <danielsousaio> FubbiQuantz: no worries! prelude docs mentions you should use the directory /personal for your custom files by the way

[18:41:11] *** Joins: ueberall (ueberall_l@user/ueberall)
[18:41:16] <pjb> but even emacs keybindings assume some; and when you define your own, you can do it for the ease of use too.
[18:42:07] <masterbuilder> to be fair, vim is exceptionally immune to keyboard layout, hijk is a problem which can be solved, although it is very nice in Dvorak too, happy accident

[18:45:17] <artefact> vi was made for the machines it first ran on, and was ok. same for emacs and lisp machines (we still have the meta/hyper nonsense today...), but emacs sucks a lot less if you don't use qwerty, imho. unless you essentially remap everything, and at that point just use emacs with a modal editing package

[18:49:53] <masterbuilder> artefact: it just seems to me like Emacs is not optimized for common actions, like, it's absolutely crazy to me that you need to have your finger pressed down on either ctrl or meta to do basic editing, in vim those are all pretty much all single characters, so I tend to prefer vim for moving around, doing basic edits, and so on. But emacs is much nicer for more complex things a lot of the time, it's good to have access to both
[18:50:06] <crazazy> hey guys, why does evil over nonGNU elpa not give any keybinds?
[18:50:07] <oats> I want to check the value of a variable, but it's defined differently in the minibuffer than the buffer I want to see its value for, how do I get around the minibuffer hijacking me lol
[18:51:02] <lisp123> masterbuilder: I wouldn't say its "absolutely crazy" since all non-modal editors are like that. Furthermore, in INSERT mode, emacs bindings are more efficient (instead of having to go back to normal mode and back)
[18:51:36] <wgreenhouse> oats: M-: (with-current-buffer "foo" variable)
[18:51:47] <lisp123> All that said, I think Emacs bindings in INSERT Mode + VI(M) for Normal Mode / Visual Mode / etc. + the scripting power of elisp is perfection :)
[18:52:06] <artefact> oh yeah, some default emacs keybindings are totally b0nkers. C-x o is a good contender
[18:52:08] <masterbuilder> lisp123: most non-modal editors only offer very minimalistic editing capabilities, what I meant was it's a crazy way to do more advanced editing
[18:52:22] <wgreenhouse> oats: or C-c C-b in ibuffer
[18:52:49] <artefact> it also stuck with the lisp keyboards which had control right next to spacebar... the ibm layout fucked that up real good
[18:53:08] <lisp123> artefact: At some point you just gotta memorise them, there's too many functions and too little keys. But Emacs does offer M-x for more mnenomic commands
[18:53:14] <oats> wgreenhouse, that key is undefined for me, what command?
[18:53:23] <aqua0210> I think you can try both, choose one you love. I choose to use Emacs key bindings finally
[18:53:36] <crazazy> hmm most non modal editors i've worked with mostly use CUA and then some special binds in the form of F-keys + optionally some modifier
[18:53:39] <masterbuilder> but the point about normal mode is completely true, thankfully you have the one shot normal command mode while in insert mode
[18:53:42] <artefact> ideally i would use alt/altgr for control, win/menu for meta, and controls for super, just like the lisp machines did
[18:53:43] <wgreenhouse> oats sorry I meant ielm not ibuffer
[18:54:01] <oats> shit that's cool

[18:54:44] <artefact> no i took the coward way out and use spacebar for control ;-)
[18:54:48] <wgreenhouse> I was wrong but half right
[18:55:17] <lisp123> Ah good old spacebar, a very useful and underused key for sure
[18:55:21] <artefact> i meant, as defaults
[18:55:45] <crazazy> you know crazy idea: tap-dance on emacs binds
[18:55:47] <lisp123> I'm not a big fan of Emacs defaults so I will keep quiet
[18:56:23] <crazazy> so that keys do different things based on if yo tap them or hold them
[18:56:45] <lisp123> crazazy: You can kinda do that with keychords

[19:00:15] <rdrg109> That's a good point of view

[21:48:53] <artefact> the lisp fundamentals are fairly language agnostic
[21:49:10] <thblt> Technically, I think you could translate Haskell in any languag, it supports Unicode in identifiers and has very, very few reserved words. (import, qualified, as, where, let, in, if, then, else, and I think that's all)  
[21:49:18] <technomancy> artefact: I translated a subset of racket into thai a few years ago
[21:49:40] <thblt> Ha right, Lisps would be the obvious candidate.
[21:49:46] <thblt> technomancy: in which language?
[21:49:48] <artefact> i doubt cadar cddr etc would be argued to be "english" even if they come from english
[21:49:52] <technomancy> the difficulty of course is that no one can translate an entire library ecosystem
[21:49:57] <pjb> The only thing that cannot be easily translated in lisp is nil.

[21:52:25] <artefact> if you can type haskell you can also type python or C or anything
[21:52:29] <thblt> johnjay: well, most functions have an infix alternative that's impossible to understand in any language, like <==!=> so it's at least equally difficult in all languages.  
[21:52:55] <artefact> i guess whitespace is the only true language-agnostic language.

[23:45:27] <johnjay> lechner: there's probably projectile or something for project management
[23:45:40] <johnjay> but informally I made some elisp which closest all non-file buffers
