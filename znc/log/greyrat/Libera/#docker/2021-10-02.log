[00:28:28] <blackwood821> How do incremental images work in Docker builds? Let's say I build my own image from some official Docker image which just adds 5 files to it. Then I create a new version of my image (using the previous version of my image as the base image) but this time only 1 of the 5 files has changed. Is there any way for the new image (layer?) to only include the 1 changed file rather duplicating the 4 files that haven't changed?
[00:30:40] <ikke> docker works with layers
[00:30:59] <ikke> The final image is a result of all layers combined
[00:31:51] <ikke> each layer only contains what is added to that layer (modifications shadow files below it)
[00:35:42] *** Joins: cX1n (~cX1n@107.159.97.244)
[00:35:53] <BtbN> You don't typically want to update your image by piling up layer after layer
[00:36:05] <BtbN> there is a hard limit to how many layers you can have, so that's not a sustainable approach
[00:36:17] <BtbN> plus, having too many layers seriously hurts performance
[00:36:47] *** Quits: tex (~super@user/dix) (Ping timeout: 246 seconds)

[00:39:29] *** Quits: jmartin (~jmartin@user/jmartin) (Remote host closed the connection)
[00:40:20] <blackwood821> So it's recommended that for version 2 of my image I would use the same base image as I used when I built version 1 rather than using my version 1 image as the base?
[00:40:45] <ikke> correct
[00:42:10] <blackwood821> The downside to that is duplicating files across multiple versions of the same image
[00:42:30] <ikke> yes
[00:43:19] <blackwood821> So even though it's not recommended, if I did use my version 1 image as the base for my version 2 image, is there even a way for the new layer to only include the changes files?
[00:43:26] <ikke> But note that the way layers work, you can only add, not really remove
[00:43:35] <ikke> so the size would only grow
[00:43:54] <ikke> blackwood821: that's already how docker works
[00:44:46] <BtbN> there is also no advantage to piling up layers for updates
[00:44:58] <BtbN> Just make a fresh proper image like everyone else
[00:45:11] <BtbN> the old unused layers will get cleaned up eventually

[00:45:57] <Habbie> blackwood821, there's a balance there - if you are keeping both versions around, stacking 2 on top of 1 might save some space
[00:46:05] <blackwood821> BtbN: assuming the older images are not still being used by some containers
[00:46:09] <Habbie> blackwood821, but your users might only ever want one version, in which case not stacking like that saves them space
[00:46:43] <blackwood821> Habbie: Right, that makes sense. If our users will mostly always be on the latest version then there's no point in stacking layers
[00:46:50] <Habbie> blackwood821, yep
[00:47:07] <blackwood821> But if some of our users don't want to update frequently, then there is some advantage in layering
[00:48:16] *** Joins: ss4 (~wootehfoo@user/wootehfoot)
[00:48:49] <blackwood821> Hypothetically, if I did use my version 1 image as the base image of my version 2 image and I COPY the 5 files from the repo but only 1 of the 5 changed, does the new layer only contain the 1 changed file?
[00:49:12] <Habbie> i don't know if it's smart enough to notice that your COPY caused no changes
[00:49:21] <Habbie> i would not count on it
[00:49:29] <BtbN> That makes no sense, why would the update frequency make any difference?
[00:49:50] <BtbN> The new layer will only contain the differences between the layer below
[00:50:01] <BtbN> But it can only ever add size to the image.
[00:50:15] <blackwood821> BtbN: because if some users don't upgrade as frequently, that means they stay on older images for longer, so when when we come out with new images, not everyone will take the new images
[00:50:16] <BtbN> If you add 2GB in one layer, and remove it in the next, the image is still 2GB in size
[00:50:27] <blackwood821> In which case there is some benefit to the new image and old image sharing files
[00:50:32] <BtbN> blackwood821, and that's related to how the images are layered in what way?
[00:50:39] <BtbN> That makes no sense
[00:51:01] <BtbN> If you update, you just pull the new image. And don't care about what its base image is, or if you have to download a few MB more
[00:51:22] <BtbN> You'll also want to update the base image itself at some point anyway
[00:52:04] *** Quits: wootehfoot (~wootehfoo@user/wootehfoot) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[00:52:54] <blackwood821> If we have two users who are both on version 1 of our image which is 2 GB, then we come out with version 2, but only 10 MB changed in version 2 because version 2 uses version 1 as the base image, then when user 2 wants to upgrade then they pull down the new image which is only pulling 10 MB
[00:53:12] <pycurious> anyone knows how to change the hostname in a running container?
[00:53:25] <blackwood821> But if version 2 uses the same base image as version 1, then when user 2 upgrades and pulls the new image they would be pulling 2 GB again, right? Even though most of that 2 GB is duplicate files from version 1
[00:53:42] <BtbN> If your image is that huge, you're probably doing something wrong to begin with
[00:53:59] <blackwood821> I'm just using that size as an example
[00:54:07] <blackwood821> And wanting to verify if that's the way it does work
[00:54:19] <BtbN> Literally everyone using Docker disagrees with your idea, sooo
[00:54:42] <BtbN> Never updating the base image is bad enough of an idea for anything else to be irrelevant
[00:55:01] <blackwood821> BtbN: I'm simply providing an example of how it can be advantage, and if you are dealing with large images, then yes, there is an advantage
[00:55:19] <BtbN> It's not an advantage, it's abusing the layer system
[00:56:56] <blackwood821> Maybe that's the case in Docker, which is why I'm asking questions... but in our current image build environment which is not Docker, it saves tons of time for weekly updates. Not only are the incremental image sizes smaller, but the build process can avoid recompiling code that hasn't changed
[00:57:13] <blackwood821> But if no one does it that way in Docker then I'll do the suggested Docker approach

[01:00:12] <Habbie> if you update the base image, any perceived benefits of basing version 2 on version 1 go away anyway
[01:00:59] <blackwood821> Right. The way we do it now (outside of Docker) is we only update the base image on major releases in which case we have to install all of our code and compile all of it

[13:40:10] <ychaouche> So if I have a node image that has a FROM chain going 5 levels down all the way to the debian image, does that mean the when I build that image, the resulting container will run a whole debian OS inside ? (minus what's already taken care of by the "host" in VM parlance)
[13:41:08] <ychaouche> and so node:buster will run a node inside a debian buster container and node:bullseye will run node inside a debian bullseye container. Is that what it is ? 
[13:46:58] <tabakhase> ychaouche different topics - and there can be only ONE "CMD" and ONE "ENTRYPOINT" - so if those say node, node is what runs.
[13:47:33] <ychaouche> but runs on what ?
[13:47:45] <ychaouche> like there must be a filesystem underneath, no ? 
[13:47:52] <tabakhase> on the "os running" in general thing - docker is a little special, NOTHING actually runs in there except the one thing it should run - - this whole "debian" thing is kinda "only there so you can use apt-get during the build" ;D
[13:47:54] <ychaouche> (contained in the image itself)
[13:48:15] *** Joins: pycurious (~Adium@user/pycurious)
[13:48:26] <ikke> A container just runs a single process (which can spawn other processes)
[13:48:38] <ikke> There can be a OS filesystem, but it's not required
[13:48:52] <tabakhase> if your language compiles, you may even build with static-links and "make a docker image that consists of a single binary"
[13:50:58] <tabakhase> example -> https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/multistage-build/#use-multi-stage-builds
[13:51:31] <tabakhase> hm ok bad example ;D seems that changed to use alpine, there used to be a scratch demo... *thinking*
[13:52:55] *** Quits: pycurious (~Adium@user/pycurious) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[13:52:59] <tabakhase> anyhow, thats kinda rarecase - usually youd kinda "still need the OS" as all the libs come from there, but it isnt ""running"" in any shape or form

[13:55:06] <ikke> There is no real init system that is running or services
[13:56:14] <ychaouche> So each docker container has its own bash, libc, etc. If the process that it's supposed to run (CMD or ENTRYPOINT) need to get a function from a library, it will fetch it from itself, rather than from the host OS. Yes ? 
[13:56:35] <ychaouche> from itself : from the container it's in.
[13:57:03] <ikke> ychaouche: are you familiar with chroot?
[13:57:08] <ychaouche> a little yeah
[13:57:23] <ikke> so a process runs, but has it's own idea of what the root filesystem is
[13:57:30] <ychaouche> aha
[13:57:54] <ikke> a docker container is like a chroot, but it isolates even more
[13:58:02] <ychaouche> with cgroups
[14:00:04] <tabakhase> chroot on horse-steroids yea ;-)
[14:00:42] <ychaouche> and so if I put debian as a base for my image, the container will have all the debian filesystem inside of it, yes ? 
[14:01:02] <ychaouche> maybe a custom image for docker containing only the essential
[14:01:18] <ikke> yes
[14:01:43] <ikke> That's why alpine is popular, because it has a very small base image
[14:01:57] <ychaouche> I was reading about that, it reduces attack surface.
[14:02:47] <wez> cgroups is what lxc become? and now lxc is implemented by cgroups?
[14:03:56] <tabakhase> lxc is its own thing, but it also uses cgroups - and like half a decade back docker used lxc as kinda shim you could say i guess...

[14:06:18] <tabakhase> still do, proxmox uses lxc for containers (and kvm for vms) - also "lxd" is still pretty popular (+ libvirt can use it too)
[14:06:43] <bencc1> is it better to run each container on a separate hyperthread or can several containers share the same hyperthread?
[14:07:11] <bencc1> I'm trying to choose between a machine with few faster cores and a machine with x2 slower cores
[14:07:50] <tabakhase> bencc1 afaik docker makes no difference there
[14:08:31] <bencc1> what about programs and processes with the same question?
[14:08:48] <bencc1> each container will run chrome and ffmpeg
[14:09:13] <bencc1> I'm not sure if it's bad when several processes compete on the same core
[14:09:48] <ychaouche> many cores means more cache
[14:09:55] <ychaouche> which is good IMO
[14:10:04] <tabakhase> both certainly multicory, chrome depending on ussage (tabs/extensions) and ffmepg on what it does i guess (encoding? screencaptures?)
[14:11:04] <ychaouche> I don't think CPU speed matters anymore because bus speed to access memory is the bottleneck (even if we have made significant progress). My current bottleneck is disk I/O.
[14:11:14] <tabakhase> (disclaimer, not sure how chrome relates with the switches needed for docker-chroming - think some of the sandboxing has to be disabled or so)
[14:11:18] <ychaouche> you should care more about that (having performant SSDs)
[14:12:21] <ychaouche> having more cache memory means using the bus less often, thus increasing speed.
[14:12:46] <bencc1> in my case L3 cache is the same on both machines
[14:13:09] <bencc1> both will have nvme so probably fast

[14:17:59] <arkanoid> Hello! How can I know the installed size of a "docker-compose up" before running it? I'm dealing with a device with very little space
[14:18:44] <ychaouche> so, If I'd like to inspect the filesystem of a debian image, I just run the image, which will fire up bash, and I'm in the chroot, right ?
[14:19:06] <tabakhase> arkanoid not. - you mean like "what images to pull would use"? - whats with runtime data? - and what you/the "thing" supposed todo if answer is no?
[14:19:20] <tabakhase> ychaouche right
[14:19:25] <ychaouche> good
[14:19:49] <tabakhase> ychaouche (and "docker exec" do jump into an already running one)
[14:20:23] <arkanoid> tabakhase: well, sure the final answer would be the sum of the sizes of all the services of the compose, sure
[14:20:32] <ychaouche> presumabley because you can images in the background and get back to them ? 
[14:20:45] <ychaouche> run images in the background*
[14:21:18] <tabakhase> arkanoid so in some sense "check if its save to up(what may pull) or if doing so would lock up the thing on 100% disk used"?
[14:21:25] <arkanoid> I just want to know if I have enough space for doing "docker up", otherwize I need to open all DockerFiles and walk back all FROM and search for sizes
[14:21:54] <arkanoid> *docker-compose up
[14:22:16] <ychaouche> ah no, docker exec is for executing a command inside a container
[14:22:21] <ychaouche> that is already running
[14:22:41] <arkanoid> second option, I fear not having enough disk space and ending up 100% disk used
[14:24:18] <tabakhase> arkanoid how dirty do you want this to be? ... smells like youd have to parse the registry, compare layers-used-in-current-tags to what you have on disk or so... - but ye, nothing inbuild of any sort, "pull" doesnt even have a dry-run option
[14:26:03] <arkanoid> Ok, thank. I'll just run the command and see what happens. YOLO
[14:28:10] <tabakhase> arkanoid id prob just estimate a ~gb value or so, make sure that dcker gets pruned/garbagecollected and have docker on its own partition...
[14:28:44] <tabakhase> so if it blows, only this blows and then you can fire some escalation
[14:29:02] <tabakhase> say, a rPi appliance thing or such
[14:29:32] <arkanoid> sure
[14:31:29] <tabakhase> maybe even run a seperate "docker-compose pull" first - with a watchdog that checks and ctrl+C´s it when hitting 99% + fires a instant GC ;D
[14:31:48] <tabakhase> in a way that sounds almost reasonable...

[17:24:42] <ikke> ychaouche: that specific command is not very useful

If I kill my container, rm the container, then start the container using docker-compose (in which case I can change the hostname) - the total time taken for this operation is 5-10 seconds. How do I figure out what is wrong and how to optimize this? I tried docker stats - but the memory/cpu usage is not much.
