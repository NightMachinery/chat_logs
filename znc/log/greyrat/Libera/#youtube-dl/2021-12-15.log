[06:13:10] <ede> but the reason being mostly youtube's throttling heh
[06:13:28] <ede> oh nice, can't check it, N/A in my country :>
[06:13:38] <squirrel> well, yt-dlp seems to work where youtube-dl doesn't, and to boot it seems to be eons faster
[06:14:20] <ede> i had a lot of videos on yt already with empty size columns, couldn't use that particular format
[06:14:37] <ede> tried to use youtube-dl on such a video once, worked

[07:03:28] <ede> squirrel, Bradipo https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl/issues/30363#issuecomment-994162047
[07:03:52] <ede> seems i forgot to check the GH before :)
[07:05:08] <ede> running ytdl -F on that URL gave me "ERROR: Signature extraction failed: Traceback (most recent call last):" btw
[07:06:39] <Bradipo> ede: So this is a known issue?
[07:06:50] <Bradipo> What's odd is that this was working just a day or two ago.
[07:07:54] <ede> wah, the line linked there looks frightening
[07:08:09] <ede> yt changes things all the time just to break such tools
[07:08:48] <ede> don't forget Google got away from "Don't be evil"
[07:08:55] <Bradipo> Hahaha, indeed.
[07:09:18] <Bradipo> I remember when Google first came out (I have/had one of the beta invites) and their mantra was "Don't be evil".
[07:09:50] <ede> cool, if you still have something (mail, w/e) just keep it. you won't get it ever again ;)
[07:10:28] <Bradipo> Not interested in gmail again fortunately.
[07:10:44] <ede> it's their own fault anyway that i MUST use ytdl for their shitty site
[07:11:01] <ede> i have some accounts for registering and the like
[07:11:07] <Bradipo> I tried yt-dlp and that fails for a different reason that I haven't figured out yet
[07:11:23] <ede> did you check its -F?
[07:11:34] <Bradipo> Which youtube-dl or yt-dlp?
[07:12:00] <Bradipo> Oh, I missed your subtle hint at using -F.
[07:12:00] <ede> i just dl'd the latest release, with the october one i have yt formats w/o a filesize sometimes which i can't use
[07:12:05] <ede> yt-dlp
[07:12:35] <Bradipo> I see, so it could just be a default format problem?
[07:12:55] <Bradipo> Well, I cannot even list the formats.
[07:13:03] <Bradipo> youtube-dl -F bombs with the same exception.
[07:13:03] <ede> i still have just some helpers here instead of a nice big script (with optional gui), so i'm presented the list and a prompt :)
[07:13:11] <ede> ugh
[07:13:38] <ede> i tried the video from the link above and -F did it
[07:13:49] <ede> with yt-dlp that is, youtube-dl errored
[07:14:11] <Bradipo> Yeah, I'm trying to get yt-dlp going, but I get a different error.
[07:14:23] <Bradipo> pkg_resources.DistributionNotFound: The 'websockets' distribution was not found and is required by yt-dlp
[07:14:33] <Bradipo> Not sure what websockets package that is yet...
[07:14:43] <ede> ah, so no filesize for f22
[07:14:59] <ede> what os?
[07:15:30] <Bradipo> OpenBSD.
[07:15:33] <ede> oh
[07:16:19] <ede> where do you get your yt-dlp from?
[07:16:28] <Bradipo> I built it from ports.
[07:16:37] <ede> ah that would explain it i guess
[07:16:48] <Bradipo> http://cvsweb.openbsd.org/ports/www/yt-dlp/
[07:17:01] <Bradipo> I'm clearly missing some dependency, but I'm not sure which yet.
[07:17:41] <ede> by joining #openbsd you could help the channel hold exactly 600 users, they may give you some bonus :)
[07:17:54] <Bradipo> Yeah, I'm in that channel too.
[07:18:00] <Bradipo> Oddly, with more users, it's more silent. :-)
[07:18:31] <ede> bsd is older than linux, so maybe they are more professional idlers ;)
[07:18:48] <Bradipo> Definitely a lot of lurkers.
[07:19:05] <Bradipo> Ok, so oddly enough, I reinstalled and it pulled in Python 3.9.7 (I only had 3.8).
[07:19:08] <Bradipo> And now it's working.
[07:19:12] <ede> my channel list becomes longer over time until a re(start|boot) :)
[07:19:39] <ede> ah fine, i had some issues to because py version
[07:20:04] <ede> ah right, my old version was TOO old so i built it from upstream, was... nice
[07:21:51] <Bradipo> I wonder if there exists a browser plugin that would be able to just take all the chunks of video/audio data that it's streaming and write to disk.
[07:22:02] <ede> Bradipo: also i still have to point the blobs to python3 ;)
[07:23:09] <ede> not sure if id would make sense, cli gives better control on what exactly gets requested
[07:23:18] <ede> resize the window and BAMM
[07:24:36] <ede> but since i just discovered pluto.tv some time ago it would be interesting though
[07:25:43] <Bradipo> cli certainly is better, but a browser would more easily thwart some of their lame measures.
[07:26:17] <Bradipo> And I don't mean that it should stream to disk the video that it is displaying, only that the browser could be used to integrate better.
[07:26:31] <Bradipo> Just pull the bytes/chunks from the site and instead of displaying to video in browser, write to disk.
[07:29:41] <ede> i had this with wwwoffle many years ago, used it during my dialup years and kept it later just for convenience
[07:29:57] <ede> only it never made it to https
[07:30:24] <Bradipo> Heh, I haven't seen wwwoffle mentioned in polite society in many years. :-)
[07:30:42] <ede> gedanken.demon.co.uk
[07:30:48] <ede> even remember the host :)
[07:31:41] <ede> i pimped the ui heavily to make it fit my needs and preferences
[07:33:20] <ede> i don't even try to guess how much money it saved me over the years. online, grab the list, offline, order the articles, online, dl them, offline, read. minutes of online time for hours of reading, not a bad deal.
[07:33:56] <ede> i even kept all my downloads in it...
[07:35:08] <ede> also back then it was possible to get youtube videos from procfs, just follow the whi^Wdeleted fd.

[19:58:56] <ede> qjsgkem: dl'd -dlp from the 1st, no -dl so far.
[20:00:27] <qjsgkem> yeah, dlp as of Dec 1 and dl as of Jun 6 here, and both fail on these two vids
[20:00:46] <qjsgkem> thank you!
[20:01:01] <ede> $ curl -I https://yt-dl.org/downloads/latest/youtube-dl | grep ^location
[20:01:36] <ede> i had a function in the past comparing the version to mine and dl'ing it if there was a new one ;)
[20:01:52] <qjsgkem> aaaah. cool!
[20:02:24] <qjsgkem> confirms 06.06 :)
[20:02:35] <ede> not sure if planned or just a happy little accident, but nice design
[20:03:29] <qjsgkem> informative redirection here, maybe 'design by lucky accident'
[20:05:29] <qjsgkem> I won't die if I cannot dl these vids this week, but it might be a sign of youtube starting to roll out some fresh complications, as those two videos would probably be very new

[21:58:10] <qjsgkem> <-- sigh of relief
[21:58:48] <ede> but irc is async anyway, a reaction tomorrow wouldn't have been a problem either
[21:58:58] <qjsgkem> your nick reminds me of something I saw over many years in Munich
[21:59:06] <ede> only till the weekend i may have needed a hint what it is about heh
[21:59:18] <ede> oh?
[21:59:33] <qjsgkem> yeah, similar here:)) aging neurons
[22:00:16] <qjsgkem> yeah, there used to be a fucking huge neon panel at Karlsplatz/Stachus, advertising 'Mercedes Benz'
[22:01:16] <ede> ah, because ede? makes me think of the intro of großstadrevier ;)
[22:01:45] <qjsgkem> the city didn;t want it and sued for removal, in the meantime one part of the display became defective, so it would display 'edes Benz'. We would joke 'getaway car', because Ede is the generic name for a smalltime gangster:))
[22:01:55] <ede> lol
[22:02:13] <ede> so my prayers were noticed? o lord, won't you buy me...
[22:02:25] <qjsgkem> awww. yeah

[22:04:17] <ede> qj, but look what you reminded me of https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parole_Chicago
[22:04:57] <ede> err, qjsgkem (i really forgot to TAB :o)
[22:05:13] <qjsgkem> oh, Slesar, sounds promising!
[22:08:32] <qjsgkem> cZ6rP-rcYHk
[22:14:32] <ede> same
[22:15:15] <ede> because mpv youtube-dl links to yt-dlp, while the executable is youtube-dl.real (hello Debian!)
[22:15:52] <qjsgkem> oh joy. worked here with dlp
[22:15:57] <ede> sometimes i'm still confused why running youtube-dl gives me a table output :>
[22:16:25] <qjsgkem> so now we have vids where both fail, and this one where only non-dlp fails. OK.
[22:16:27] <ede> maybe just that 2-letter thing from the error has to be added, didn't dig into it
[22:16:52] <ede> dlp fails for you on the others you posted?
[22:16:58] <qjsgkem> right
[22:17:05] <qjsgkem> both fail on the other two
[22:17:13] <ede> are you up-to-date there?
[22:17:47] <qjsgkem> cZ6rP-rcYHk wasn't even meant as an error example, but for your consumption/enjoyment:)
[22:18:10] <qjsgkem> if Dec 1 and Jun 6 are the respective newest versions, yes
[22:18:46] <ede> ah :)
[22:19:19] <ede> j7_su0aOaJA works for me with yt-dlp

[22:26:41] <ede> ah maybe you need some newer python. not being on stable i had to build it anyway xD
[22:28:19] <qjsgkem> OK, poor old Atom box now chewing away on building py3.9.7;)
[22:28:21] <ede> ah, now i see -dl runs on an older version than -dlp here (3.9.7 is the one)
[22:28:38] <ede> is Atom worse than my K6-2? ;)
[22:29:06] <qjsgkem> heh, join the scrapheap club:)
[22:29:32] <ede> TPF, they did a good job, building it was just fun after dropping 3.10 which had a flaw in the configure process.
[22:30:03] <ede> everything's fine here until i start *using* firefox
[22:30:44] <qjsgkem> well, this box here is *not* the atom box, but it starts creaking when I start fiferoxwith 5500 tabs:)
[22:31:04] <ede> 5500 lol. i try to keep it <20 ;)
[22:31:38] <qjsgkem> 2009 quad-core, 16GB, limited joy:)
[22:31:38] <ede> but it's video (which i avoid if i can, but didn't find a workaround so far for pluto.tv), but also things like twitter
[22:31:44] <ede> wooho
