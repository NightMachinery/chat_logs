[08:23:56] <quanticle> I dunno, RMS *is* a shithead, but he's a shithead who happens to be *right* about a lot of stuff
[08:24:02] <quanticle> Right in the most obnoxious way
[08:24:13] <quanticle> Like, you go back and read "The Right To Read", for example
[08:24:19] <quanticle> And yeah, it's obnoxious
[08:24:21] <quanticle> But is it wrong?
[08:24:27] <ngoldbaum> for sure right about the gplv3
[08:24:53] <ngoldbaum> that was very worth it and wasn’t a colossal failure that led straight to llvm existing
[08:24:59] <quanticle> I'll 100% admit
[08:25:04] <quanticle> I was wrong about the GPLv3
[08:25:08] <quanticle> I thought it was pure paranoia
[08:25:23] <quanticle> But increasingly? Nah, I think it's necessary
[08:25:24] <ngoldbaum> and in general the popularity of bsd-style licenses in favor of copyleft these days
[08:26:26] <quanticle> He saw the corporatization of open source, and I didn't, so I'm willing to cut him a bit of slack
[08:39:27] <cb> gplv3 is imho fsf overplaying their hand
[08:40:03] <cb> people didnt mind gplv2, with gplv3 they alienated everyone from linus to many large corps who know considered anything gpl radioactive waste
[08:40:25] <quanticle> That's kind of the point though. It's *free* software. Not open source.
[08:40:44] <cb> and people liked the v2 version of "you give back" i.e. linus
[08:41:01] <cb> with v3 they saw it retroactively adding more shit that blew out the scope
[08:41:12] <cb> if GPLv3 was basically cleaned up GPLv2 minus tivoization clausees LLVM would have stayed a research project
[08:41:40] <quanticle> Well, sure, but on the other hand, would Android have evolved into the proprietary mess that it did if the Linux kernel had been GPLv3?
[08:41:59] <cb> there wouldn't have been an android
[08:42:05] <cb> or it'd be based on netbsd
[08:42:08] <manicennui> quanticle: They would have used something else.
[08:42:22] <cb> and linux would have lost a lot of industry support
[08:43:06] <quanticle> Yeah, that's fair, but there is a part of me (the RMS part, I guess) that looks at that situation and says, "Good"
[08:43:38] <quanticle> Like, we didn't make free software so that Jeff fucking Bezos could become a billionaire more easily
[08:43:58] <cb> i think that's exactly what free software ended up doing because rms has a very very narrow threat model
[08:44:02] <cb> that most people dont have
[08:44:03] <quanticle> We made free software so that users could have software that they could modify and share and be helpful
[08:44:59] <cb> the stuff that might have been able to added to actually stop it 1. would have been anathema bc it'd likely violate one of the four freedoms (no restrictions on use) 2. it would bne toxic waste for all but hobbyists
[08:45:07] <quanticle> There's a part of me that *prefers* a world where Facebook and Google and all the rest are built on top of like... HP-UX
[08:45:25] <cb> in this world BSDs ultimately exist
[08:45:41] <cb> what happens is if linux kneecaps itself we get the vermaden timeline
[08:45:43] <quanticle> Well... maybe. I'm assuming that the lawsuit still stirs up a lot of FUD
[08:45:46] <cb> everyone uses freebsd
[08:45:57] <quanticle> So proprietary Unixes don't die
[08:46:03] <cb> oh proprietary unices die
[08:46:09] <cb> freebsd eats the corpse instead
[08:46:37] <cb> linux only happens because of license boogeymen but if linux is gplv3, freebsd even if it's in a license quagmire looks more desirable to industry
[08:46:52] <quanticle> Nah, because w/o the GPL, any improvement to the kernel just gets incorporated into the proprietary Unices
[08:47:12] <cb> the vendors don't want to develop the proprietary unices
[08:47:19] <cb> they're money sinks and commodity wins
[08:47:32] <cb> around the turn of the millenium they (esp IBM) went hard in linux
[08:47:42] <cb> and if linux was gplv3 toxic waste they'd have gone for a bsd instead
[08:47:49] <quanticle> Yeah, that's fair. All the proprietary Unix vendors are hardware companies, fundamentally
[08:47:51] <quanticle> You've got a point
[08:48:01] <quanticle> IBM, HP, Sun, SGI
[08:48:04] <quanticle> etc
[08:49:01] <cb> they were shedding the specialized HW except for IBM and moving towards commidity
[08:49:04] <cb> this includes itanium
[08:49:10] <cb> developing a CPU is fucking expensive
[08:49:22] <cb> which is why i.e. HP (it was HP's baby) and SGI were interested
[08:50:06] <quanticle> Is it bad that I *also* wanted Itanium to succeed? :P
[08:54:09] <drakonis> the vermaden future is a future of zombies
[08:54:12] <drakonis> everything is proprietary
[08:54:36] <drakonis> because there's no incentive at all to open up any contributions extracted off the proprietary fork
[08:55:21] <quanticle> Well, that's what I don't understand w.r.t. what cb is saying. My position is that every Unix vendor takes BSD as their base and adds on their own spices and flavorings.
[08:55:48] <quanticle> So while the core BSD kernel and some user space tools are probably the same, each proprietary Unix is going to have its own extensions
[08:55:58] <quanticle> And BSD becomes kind of like POSIX
[08:56:03] <drakonis> don't ever assume that any vendor will do it from the goodness of their heart
[08:56:13] <drakonis> also bsd is heavy on gatekeeping
[08:56:40] <drakonis> which also nullifies any incentives to participate because your contributions arent valued if you're not in the ingroup
[08:56:49] <cb> it's rarely worth maintaining your own fork
[08:57:08] <quanticle> Unless you can market it as giving your tools an advantage.
[08:57:10] <cb> esp as your customers want commodity and differentiating is expensive
[08:57:22] <cb> again, in the late 90s the writing was on the wall
[08:57:32] <cb> they were all winding it down and using linux for non-legacy instead
[08:57:37] <cb> if the tides change it'd be a BSD instead
[08:57:44] <drakonis> tell you what, i've had someone who contributes to freebsd rant about it earlier today
[08:57:49] <cb> and they *did* take BSD code for the proprietary unices; often for v6 stacks
[08:57:51] <quanticle> Like, the extreme case for this is Windows, right? Why hasn't Microsoft abandoned Windows and switched to a Linux or BSD kernel? Windows must be giving them some proprietary advantage, or they'd have abandoned it.
[08:58:04] <drakonis> freebsd's entire cultural structure works against itself
[08:58:18] <cb> because windows isn't just a BSD/SysV kernel
[08:58:32] <quanticle> Well, neither was HP-UX by the '90s
[08:58:32] <cb> and microsoft is already doing that just in extreme slow motion
[08:58:43] <drakonis> the sheer amount of gatekeeping is one of the reasons why it has never recovered marketshare, even though there was so much complaining about linux and systemd
[08:58:55] <drakonis> getting new people to contribute to it is an incredible uphill battle
[08:59:05] <cb> drakonis: ime the people who'd complain about systemd would basically want freebsd to stay a fossil
[08:59:15] <drakonis> ^
[08:59:17] <cb> see oo.o and ribbon refuseniks
[08:59:18] <drakonis> that's one of the issues
[08:59:41] <drakonis> culturally speaking, getting change to take place in it is very difficult
[08:59:43] <quanticle> Okay, real talk: why is systemd bad? Difficulty: you cannot use the phrase "unix philosophy" in your answer
[08:59:56] <drakonis> intel had people paid to contribute to it a few years back and it didnt last
[08:59:58] <cb> the execution is a little sloppy buit the ideas are correct
[09:00:00] <drakonis> they went back to work on linux
[09:00:15] <cb> drakonis: i'm basically 100% with david chsinall on whatever he says about fbsd
[09:00:21] <bkero> Non-plaintext logs
[09:00:24] <cb> he's a contributor and is sad shit gets squandered
[09:00:26] <drakonis> david chisnall is a cool lad
[09:00:27] <bkero> non-composability
[09:00:36] <drakonis> the person i was talking to, works with him on a daily basis
[09:00:56] <drakonis> i'm glad i invited him
[09:00:56] <bkero> Is not memory safe
[09:01:01] <drakonis> he's great.
[09:01:08] <drakonis> also patient
[09:01:12] <drakonis> i'm sure he's a masochist :V
[09:01:12] <quanticle> bkero: Okay, now we're getting somewhere
[09:01:15] <cb> freebsd has a bunch of people from i.e. juniper and netflix working on trying to improve the base OS while all the users are 30 year old unix boomers
[09:01:21] <cb> bkero: brb RiiR
[09:01:22] <drakonis> lol
[09:01:26] <drakonis> juniper doesnt even contribute
[09:01:32] <cb> yeah they gave up
[09:01:34] <bkero> cb: Godspeed.
[09:01:43] <drakonis> the last thing they did was throw libxo into the source then ollie outie of the community
[09:01:55] <drakonis> 30 year old unix boomers lol
[09:01:57] <cb> and no one uses libxo, again, more freebsd squandering shit
[09:02:01] <cb> same with jails
[09:02:03] <cb> you were first
[09:02:03] <drakonis> they're 50 year old boomers
[09:02:05] <bkero> Is fBSD still using DDX?
[09:02:07] <quanticle> ^
[09:02:08] <drakonis> jails are flexible but userspace is trash
[09:02:09] <cb> except you had terrible tooling for it
[09:02:16] <cb> so linux ate your lunch
[09:02:17] <drakonis> horrible horrible tooling that you cant use
[09:02:26] <quanticle> I worked with a 50-year-old Unix boomer once. He was really cool, actually. I learned a lot
[09:02:27] <bkero> Or are they still scraping by with Linux KMS FB drivers and 802.11n?
[09:02:28] <cb> see also capsicum
[09:02:29] <drakonis> because you can only use it for the explicit purpose of jailing a full system
[09:02:36] <cb> bkero: bsds use DRM now
[09:02:41] <cb> they write their own drivers usually
[09:02:41] <quanticle> Dude got into Unix after he got laid off from Unisys
[09:02:52] <drakonis> bkero: they wrote a layer that leans on linux emulation to get modern gpu support
[09:02:56] <bkero> cb: The Intel stuff used XAA last I checked, which wasn't that long ago.
[09:03:03] <drakonis> honestly
[09:03:05] <bkero> and yes, it's all just loaned pieces form Linux
[09:03:09] <bkero> from*
[09:03:30] <drakonis> its a fucked up hack because it only serves to deeply nail the realization that freebsd will never be relevant again
[09:03:34] <cb> i'm going to bed because irc is boring now
[09:03:38] <drakonis> is it?
[09:03:42] <drakonis> i got you some non boring shit lol
[09:03:42] <cb> AND IT'S 1:30
[09:03:45] <drakonis> oh
[09:03:48] <drakonis> its 1:30 here my guy
[09:03:49] <drakonis> i'm still up
[09:03:57] <cb> show me the non-boring shit
[09:03:58] <drakonis> imma read me some books to sleep though
[09:03:59] <cb> then i sleep
[09:04:05] <drakonis> lmao
[09:04:35] <drakonis> okay so, how do you feel about quakecon?
[09:04:44] <cb> zero opinion, not a gamer
[09:04:47] <drakonis> ok cool
[09:04:48] <cb> well kinda
[09:05:00] <cb> but i dont thnink id made any worthwhule game past doom 2
[09:05:02] <drakonis> rumour says that the quake reboot might be announced there?
[09:05:09] <drakonis> quake was good though
[09:05:28] <cb> for some reason quake bores me to tears
[09:05:31] <drakonis> anything past quake 2 was just rehashing the boring arena shooter shit
[09:05:32] <cb> i think its the aesthetics
[09:05:49] <drakonis> the aesthetics are a lot better in the maps
[09:05:54] <drakonis> community maps
[09:05:58] <cb> and there's not a lot of meat bc all id did was rehash the boomer shooter or arena shooter for a while until doom 3
[09:06:05] <cb> which not my thing but i respect doing something diff
[09:06:08] <drakonis> arena shooters
[09:06:13] <drakonis> boomer shooters are a new thing i guess???
[09:06:15] <drakonis> new gimmick
[09:06:20] <drakonis> that said
[09:06:33] <cb> for some reason slavs are OBSESSED with basically making doom/quake clones
[09:06:42] <drakonis> just slavs?
[09:06:50] <cb> eastern europeans in general
[09:06:51] <drakonis> you mean like
[09:06:53] <drakonis> hrot?
[09:06:57] <cb> stuff like that
[09:07:04] <cb> but also even like painkiller et al
[09:07:05] <drakonis> hrot is definitely a eastern european game
[09:07:09] <drakonis> oh sure
[09:07:12] <cb> most of those studios are from like poland or czechia
[09:07:19] <cb> that make modern boomer shooters
[09:07:27] <drakonis> i think its something to do with how these countries werent console heavy
[09:07:42] <cb> for me doom basically invented and peaked the boomer shooter, most entries after that is redundant
[09:08:03] <cb> if i get a boomer shooter craving doom has this je ne sais quoi about it
[09:08:07] <drakonis> oh yes
[09:08:09] <drakonis> i agree there
[09:08:48] <drakonis> there have been some pretty interesting work in doom source ports to give it fully 3d maps
[09:08:58] <drakonis> no cheating with portals
[09:09:06] <cb> i used to play with doom mapping
[09:09:11] <cb> maybe i should get back into it then

[14:41:05] <gerikson> Bitcoin, in so far as it is a currency, is a fiat currency

[15:01:48] <goodger[m]> real money and bad cars
[15:02:15] <goodger[m]> but I have to disagree; bitcoin is not fiat and is not a currency
[15:04:54] <goodger[m]> well, it may be considered a currency under some definitions, but it's certainly not fiat, which is a technical term referring to a currency's establishment as the means of paying tax
[15:30:31] <gerikson> nah it's a currency whose worth is determined by "decree" rather than being a commodity like gold
[15:42:49] <goodger[m]> right, but that decree is the decree that the currency is how you pay tax
[15:49:38] <Brekkjern> By the definition of fiat money in the ingress of Wikipedia (lolwikipediaetc) I think bitcoin fits the description

[19:05:33] <manicennui> I know people making bay area pay working remotely and living in the Chicago suburbs.
[19:05:43] <manicennui> Many Google employees should be able to just find new jobs.
[19:05:54] <manicennui> Especially with salaries spiking in the last 18 months.
[19:08:26] <manicennui> I know many of the companies that have been distributed for a long time don't give cost of living adjustments, and use average salaries from the Bay area to pay everyone.
[19:08:41] <manicennui> Because you really aren't competing against local companies for labor.
[19:08:54] <manicennui> My employer is quickly finding this out.
[19:10:00] <manicennui> Someone on my team really wanted to remain remote, and my employer was not being clear about our plans, so he started looking casually and managed to find a job with Bay area pay.
[19:10:04] <manicennui> My employer couldn't match it.
[19:10:11] <manicennui> Really "wouldn't".
[19:10:20] <manicennui> Not that I would for him.
[19:10:24] <gerikson> heh
[19:11:07] <manicennui> They are just now telling us that it is possible for ICs to be fully remote, but we must work it out with our managers.
[19:11:20] <prussian> rip.
[19:11:21] <manicennui> Fortunately we have managers who are decent about that sort of thing.
[19:11:53] <manicennui> We also pushed back our return to the office because of the spike in cases.
[19:12:04] <manicennui> It was going to be next month.
[19:12:34] <prussian> full remote, forever, for me basically.
[19:12:35] <prussian> damn
[19:12:58] <manicennui> I think next year I'll look for something remote doing what I want.
[19:13:11] <gwozniak> Although I'm remote, most of the people employed by my company work in an office, and the upper management would like for them to be there. Thankfully, they have not been pushing hard for it.
[19:13:24] <manicennui> My employer has agreed to do 3 days in the office, 2 days remote for everyone whenever we do return to the office.
[19:13:57] <manicennui> They were pretty good about random WFH days before, but they always opposed a set WFH schedule.
[19:13:58] <gwozniak> Mine started phasing people back in, but that's different now with the case spike
[19:14:18] <gwozniak> Seems they are looking to be more flexible in the future, though
[19:14:26] <gwozniak> Doesn't matter for me
[19:14:26] <gerikson> I wonder how the situation is in Minneapolis
[19:14:37] <gerikson> mothership is there and they're kinda calling the shots
[19:19:03] <manicennui> At some point companies are going to have to realize that it doesn't matter what the locals are doing, at least for software.
[19:19:43] <manicennui> They'll end up with a large percentage of their employees being people who can't get better jobs remotely.
[19:20:52] <gerikson> hah, very true
[19:21:10] <gerikson> I actually like working in an office
[19:21:22] <gerikson> we don't have good space for home working here
[19:21:26] <gerikson> my commute is 30m
[19:21:45] <gerikson> I like the separation of concerns, and the social part
[19:21:59] <gerikson> it'll shake out after a while
[19:22:07] <gwozniak> I don't mind an office if it's not hard to get to. When I worked at the startup, it was a 20 minute walk
[19:22:18] <gwozniak> I like working at home now
[19:22:30] <gwozniak> But it's not a hard requirement
[19:22:43] <gerikson> we're planning to move to the summer house in ~3yrs

[20:14:18] <manicennui> river: Doesn't use a lot of CPU, but it is sluggish pretty often.
[20:14:25] <river> hm :(
[20:14:33] <river> i will probably not continue to use it then
[20:14:41] <prussian> companion_cube: that lawsuit was a shit show.
[20:14:42] <manicennui> I think closing the tab and reopening it helps.
[20:14:43] <prussian> jesus
[20:14:51] <companion_cube> it was
[20:14:54] <prussian> I'm glad it resolved relatively well.
[20:14:59] <prussian> we'll see.
[20:15:20] <prussian> river: Idk, I just use znc and irssi
[20:15:27] <prussian> on my phone I just use revolution irc.
[20:16:14] <pja> prussian: Trumpist lunatics as far as I can see.
[20:16:20] <prussian> pja: so it seems...
[20:16:29] <prussian> I'm watching it live cuz I guess it is MUST WATCH.
[20:16:36] <ngoldbaum> fiance is gonna demo a $140,000 waterproof prosthetic leg in a minute here
[20:16:43] <prussian> can we end all politicism?
[20:16:48] <ngoldbaum> being an amputee is expensive
[20:16:54] <prussian> ngoldbaum: ya no shit.
[20:17:01] <prussian> anything medical is expensive.
[20:17:20] <prussian> Humira is something I'm probably gonna need. not looking forward to the endless jabs and their unit costs.
[20:18:03] <manicennui> Just ignore your health like I do.
[20:18:13] <manicennui> Problem will resolve itself eventually.
[20:18:18] <prussian> simple as.
[20:18:21] <prussian> good point.
[20:18:26] <river> wow
[20:18:32] <river> closing the tab and opening did solve it lol
[20:18:33] <river> nice
[20:18:48] <manicennui> river: Yeah, I assume that it builds up too much data in memory or something.
[20:19:05] <prussian> garbage collection broken?
[20:19:08] <river> they should fix that!
[20:19:16] <river> that is my opinion on irccloud
[20:19:30] <manicennui> river: BTW, you can also stay connected indefinitely by keeping a tab open somewhere.
[20:19:35] <manicennui> I don't pay for it.
[20:19:42] <prussian> damn. rude as fuck.
[20:19:45] <manicennui> I have a tab that stays open on my desktop.
[20:20:00] <prussian> I tried https://github.com/thelounge/thelounge
[20:20:01] <buttsbot> GitHub - thelounge/thelounge: 💬  ‎ Modern, responsive, cross-platform, self-hosted web IRC client
[20:20:09] <prussian> but it just absolutely destroys phone battery
[20:20:38] <manicennui> IRCCloud seems okay on mobile devices, but I don't use it constantly.
[20:20:44] <prussian> idk. I should get off my ass and just make my own client.
[20:20:45] <manicennui> The notifications do seem delayed quite a bit.
[20:20:54] <companion_cube> weechat!1!!
[20:21:02] <companion_cube> damn I should get my new phone today
[20:21:04] <prussian> b-but I like Irssi
[20:21:05] <companion_cube> setup is going to be fun
[20:21:13] <river> i wused glowing bear for a bit
[20:21:26] <river> and i thought irccloud would fix the issue that it's laggy when ever you change tabs
[20:21:32] <companion_cube> you uwused glowing bear?
[20:22:04] <prussian> maybe some kind of service worker thing.
[20:22:07] <manicennui> river: I would probably nag them if I paid for it.
[20:22:14] <river> yeah
[20:22:19] <manicennui> I deal with the issues because I'm kind of abusing it.
[20:22:19] <prussian> perhaps on tab change the client has to do a bunch of things that tank performance.
[20:22:24] <river> it just surprises me!
[20:22:31] <river> they have thousands of users dealing with this problem?
[20:22:35] <prussian> the web is p nightmare
[20:22:36] <prussian> idk man
[20:22:39] <river> yeah it is
[20:22:40] <manicennui> river: I don't know how many people use it in a browser though.
[20:22:51] <river> oh i thought that was the whole point
[20:22:57] <river> i didn't realize it had a client
[20:22:59] <manicennui> Maybe the mobile app is better with extensive use.
[20:23:06] <prussian> I don't know how people do it. no i'm not ranting about it being demon spyware conspiracy. just that, damn.
[20:23:07] <river> ohh mobile
[20:23:07] <prussian> whack
[20:23:10] <river> i always forget about mobiel
[20:23:29] <prussian> client is probably just webview lol
[20:23:31] <prussian> many such cases.
[20:24:07] <manicennui> Probably.
[20:24:21] <manicennui> But it seems to be reloading completely when I switch to it most of the time.
[20:27:13] <manicennui> At least in iOS, I think apps are suspended when you aren't using them.
[20:27:32] <manicennui> Unless they implement background workers, which are limited in iOS.
[20:30:48] <prussian> that's what happens to IglooIRC, or at least as far as eskimo has told me.
[20:31:12] <prussian> don't use iOS though.
[20:35:36] <ngoldbaum> eskimo a very trustable character and not a racist troll
[20:35:44] <manicennui> Slack managed to fuck up sentence selection.
[20:35:52] <manicennui> If you double click a word, it selects the word.
[20:35:58] <manicennui> The third click in most apps would expand to the entire line.
[20:36:04] <manicennui> In Slack it italicizes the word.
[20:36:09] <manicennui> Like WTF.
[20:36:12] <manicennui> Who wanted this?
[20:37:10] <prussian> ngoldbaum: I don't think he is racist. he a nut though. I can at least stand by that.
[20:37:38] <prussian> hell, he has a newborn now and the woman he consorts with is also not one that inspires confidence.
[20:37:43] <prussian> anyhow...
[20:37:54] <prussian> but yes, not my favorite irc'er
[20:38:08] <prussian> manicennui: lol what?
[20:38:11] <prussian> nice...

[21:32:09] <indigo> I'm amazed at how poor Slack's UX has become
[21:32:36] <bkero> never stop dropping keystrokes
[21:33:35] <dasm> indigo: weeslack. it's pretty decent way of working with slack, atm
[21:33:45] <gerikson> prussian: lol you know about eskimo's private life?
[21:35:57] <companion_cube> I wanted to like weeslack but it's horribly slow for me :/
[21:36:10] <companion_cube> opening a channel takes several seconds (to download the content I guess?)
[21:36:58] <dasm> i know it was very slow in the past. i had to update it several times before they fixed that up.
[21:37:17] <dasm> if there is a long unread history, it is about few seconds to fetch all of it.
[21:39:19] <Geekingfrog> weeslack is broken with user token now: https://github.com/wee-slack/wee-slack/issues/844 D:
[21:39:20] <buttsbot> Session tokens no longer working · Issue #844 · wee-slack/wee-slack · GitHub
[21:40:07] <dasm> :(
[21:44:39] <prussian> gerikson: ama.
[21:45:18] <gerikson> don't really wanna know
[21:45:19] <prussian> he runs some weird scammy marketing company and hires IRC people to be his contractors. apparently he also has sexual relations with at least one said contractor too.
[21:45:28] <gerikson> don't have a beef w/ eskimo
[21:45:31] <prussian> probably for the best.
[21:45:33] <gerikson> phanes now...
[21:45:38] <gerikson> scary dude
[21:45:50] <prussian> I just, mostly ignore him. he is sort of too much for me.
[21:46:34] <cb> i wanna try ripcord but like
[21:46:42] <cb> i dont wanna lose my account if i get b*
[21:48:52] <prussian> never knew this was a thing.
[21:48:54] <prussian> sounds epic
[21:54:12] <gerikson> prussian: he got too much for Freenode too
[21:54:31] <prussian> from his side, he just did it "for the lulz" the being a mod thing.
[21:54:35] <prussian> or opper
[21:55:28] <prussian> rip Freenode...
[21:55:45] <gerikson> I got the impression he took it very seriously
[21:55:49] <gerikson> he's not like l0de
[21:56:06] <prussian> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[21:56:15] <prussian> like I said, he is an extremely cringey guy.
[21:56:40] <gerikson> hah
[21:57:03] <gerikson> Lee refrenced his blog in one of his first crazy blog posts
[21:57:08] <prussian> lol
[22:00:42] <gerikson> WTF https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Karl_Emich_of_Leiningen#Marriages_and_children

[22:43:53] <dimadima> these defunct royals are something else
[23:10:13] <cb> https://lobste.rs/s/xxbrhq/console_desktop_guide_2018#c_8yifii this is lame enough im not bothering replying
[23:10:14] <buttsbot> Console Desktop Guide (2018) | Lobsters
[23:24:17] <dimadima> hate to be that guy bitching about css but why would someone spend so much time making such a nice page but not apply padding or max-width or something like that
[23:24:58] <dimadima> (that console desktop guide)
[23:25:15] <kline> probably only views it in lynx, on a console
[23:25:30] <dimadima> was just thinking that hahaha
[23:25:42] <dimadima> and uses the framebuffer for those colomobo pics?
[23:26:22] <kline> right
[23:26:30] <kline> why would you write a guide about using the console
[23:26:38] <kline> and then immediately start talking about the framebuffer?
[23:26:40] <kline> i just dont get it
[23:28:00] <dimadima> concerned that the audience still wants some way to see graphics?
[23:28:20] <dimadima> this is more like a guide to how this person uses unix
[23:33:15] <dimadima> the most thought provoking thing i've read in the last few weeks have been this
[23:33:18] <dimadima> https://wakaba.c3.cx/shii/shiichan
[23:33:18] <buttsbot> Shiichan Anonymous BBS - the forum software's official home page
[23:34:51] <dimadima> A preliminary study done by... me in March 2005 found that there was no noticeable difference between 2channel and forums.gentoo.org in terms of useful posts, off-topic posts, and nonsense in a long thread about technical issues. On the American forum 4-ch.net where posts can be either anonymous or pseudonymous, most of the actual helpful contributions to technical discussions came from anonymous
[23:34:57] <dimadima> users, whereas pseudonymous users tended to offer their personal experiences.
[23:35:50] <dimadima> which is basically an elaboration of a bullet above, "Anonymity counters vanity. "
[23:38:30] <companion_cube>  > in 2005
[23:40:17] <dimadima> what do you think has changed?
[23:42:03] <companion_cube> anonymous boards? gentoo? :D
[23:42:12] <companion_cube> internet culture is not the same as in 2005
[23:43:50] <gerikson> tempted to post that to FReenode
[23:43:57] <gerikson> that 2chan link
[23:45:21] <dimadima> post that to freenode?
[23:45:46] <dimadima> what's left on freenode
[23:46:13] *** Quits: Seirdy (~Seirdy@sourcehut/user/seirdy) (Quit: exiting 3.3-dev)
[23:47:06] <dimadima> gentoo or not, humans are probably more or less the same now as in 2005. that vanity thing resonated w/ me cause i think i'm personally guilty
[23:47:21] <dimadima> *users, whereas pseudonymous users tended to offer their personal experiences.* hit me pretty hard :/
[23:47:36] <companion_cube> it's an interesting post
[23:47:44] <companion_cube> I just mean that *chans are not the same
[23:47:51] <companion_cube> people are more or less the same, culture is not
[23:48:15] <dimadima> yeah i'm sure chans are different these days. certainly everyone on 4chan talks about how 4chan is dead :)
[23:48:31] <dimadima> shame i never visited those back in the day to have a reference
[23:49:21] <indigo> dimadima: Back in the day, everyone was also talking about how 4chan is dead lol
[23:53:26] <dimadima> heh makes sense
