[00:50:51] <aidalgol> I mean with SSL/TLS.
[00:51:22] <aidalgol> Someone refresh my memory: what prevents MITM attacks with that?
[00:52:21] <aidalgol> Server has a certificate.  Client has the public keys for signing certificates (CAs).  Why can't someone sit in between the two hosts and relay traffic?
[00:53:39] <Common-Lisp> nothing prevents there being an actual MITM in SSL  
[00:53:49] <Common-Lisp> but they can't actually read the contents of the message
[00:54:00] <dale> Server certificate is signed by the CA.  You assume the CA doesn't sign keys for example.com except for the owner of example.com.
[00:54:11] <dale> If you mint a cert for example.com, it won't be signed by a CA.
[00:54:14] <Common-Lisp> the MITM doesn't have the server's private key, so they can't decrypt the traffic

[00:55:01] <aidalgol> dale: Right, I know that bit.
[00:55:22] <wasamasa> the MITM could make use of their own certs, establish a connection with them and hope the client accepts them
[00:55:32] <wasamasa> this is commonly done in corporate environments
[00:55:36] <aidalgol> Oh right, this also relies on DNS not lying to you.
[00:55:51] <aidalgol> That's the bit I was forgetting.
[00:56:15] <wasamasa> where you have such a CA preconfigured in your client, but need to configure all kinds of things to make use of the certs
[00:56:22] <wasamasa> because you'd otherwise get certificate errors
[01:00:37] <bpalmer> aidalgol: DNS not lying to you, and DNS not lying to the certificate authority at time of signing.

[01:03:13] <bpalmer> thus, if you try to connect to https://www.example.com , if DNS lies to you and you're "really" connecting to https://bad.example.org , the certificate presented to you doesn't include example.com as a valid domain for that certificate.

[01:58:22] <homerj> I'll be honest, I'm Trump'ed out on shady/illegal stuff he did

[02:00:48] <bpalmer> that's even better than RSS, some might say.

[02:03:08] <aidalgol> And people were hurling abuse at anyone on that instance, and saying they were enabling stalking behaviour.
[02:03:48] <aidalgol> This time, I'm ~80% certain it wasn't just on instances that yours has defederated.
[02:03:50] <bpalmer> Yeah. This is actually a tiny reflection of the problem with complaints about doxing.
[02:03:59] <aidalgol> bpalmer: hmm?

[03:18:19] <technomancy> edrx: I fixed the problem I was having with emacs-lua by adding "noexcept" on the line from the compiler error message btw
[03:18:40] <edrx> oh, great
[03:19:15] <edrx> did you do that by changing the .cpp?
[03:19:18] <technomancy> yeah
[03:19:28] <edrx> can you send me the new version?
[03:19:42] <edrx> if you prefer e-mail I'm eduardoochs@gmail.com
[03:19:48] <technomancy> sure thing
[03:19:49] <technomancy> but I saw that there doesn't seem to be a way to move data from emacs to lua or vice versa
[03:20:01] <edrx> I have hacks for that!!! =)
[03:20:02] <technomancy> did I overlook something or is that missing
[03:20:34] <edrx> right now they only work for strings
[03:20:55] <edrx> but Lua can send sexps as strings and emacs can read them
[03:21:19] <edrx> do you want help to run these hacks?
[03:22:02] <technomancy> no, that's fine; I understand how to do that but that's easy to do without emacs-lua too
[03:22:55] <technomancy> I thought the point of putting Lua in the same process is that you can share data without the overhead of serialization

[04:11:48] <aidalgol> bpalmer: But to comment on that article in particular, it essentially argues that the word "folx" is just "Queer Theory" trying to be "disruptive."
[04:11:48] <bpalmer> Nonetheless, folx is a real thing and seems "obviously" tied in to the use of x in contexts like womxn and latinx

[04:19:00] <bpalmer> ok, I lied. Before I go: ski, the reason I would avoid things like 'sibling of X includes X' is mostly practical, for the same reason that '1' is not considered prime .

[05:01:35] <ski> i remember i refused to use notation like `d y / d x' for years .. until i figured out that dependent&independent variables is basically dynamic scope. this is also the difference between "total" and "partial" derivative

[05:03:18] <ski> yea, was just about to say
[05:04:39] <ski> consider `d f(x,y,t) / d t' (with `x' and `y' being dependent variables, (possibly) depending on the (at least in this context) independent variable `t'). for concreteness, say `x = g(t)' and `y = h(t)'
[05:06:29] <ski> then, if we consider a partial derivative `d f(x,y,t) / d t', then this really means `(d f(x,y,t) / d t)_(x = g(t) ; y = h(t))' (the `let' is outside the derivative operation). but if we consider it as a total derivative, then it means `d f(x,y,t)_(x = g(t) ; y = h(t)) / d t', which is of course equal to `d f(g(t),h(t),t) / d t'
[05:07:05] <edrx> ski: yes, one of the problems of notations like that is that they don't seem to be formalized anywhere...

[05:37:06] <ski> bpalmer : fwiw, in higher math, the multiplicand vs. multiplier distinction can sometimes be useful to keep in mind (e.g. group theory, (normal) subgroup vs. factor (/ "quotient") group)
[05:37:12] <aidalgol> Catie: Out of idle curiosity, you have any of your own, or just occasionally get saddled with your siblings' offspring?
[05:37:21] <aidalgol> grym: What about "kumquat"?
[05:37:57] <grym> aidalgol: i don't think so; we aren't amazingly into botany at the moment 
[05:38:16] <Catie> aidalgol: None of my own, no immediate plans to change that. Two of my sisters have five between them, the other two siblings of acceptable child-having age have yet to have any, and the rest are well younger than me
[05:38:19] <bpalmer> my favorite response to bradfitz's tweet about The Talk about IEEE 754 was this: "They gotta learn sometime, but you don’t want it to be your kid who tells the whole class where denormals come from."
[05:38:25] <bpalmer> ski: sure, absolutely. 
[05:38:32] <grym> though when spring comes and we plant the garden again, maybe that'll change; i have a decent microscope now so we can make slides of leaf bits and everything 
[05:38:54] <aidalgol> Catie: Well I hope you take every opportunity to indoctrinate them to the ways of Emacs.
[05:39:02] <ski> (the normal subgroup is a multiplicand (/ quotient / quota), in some sense. it's "replicated" into the cosets. the factor group plays the rôle of the multiplier)
[05:39:24] <Catie> aidalgol: I'm gonna teach them all to program Lisp and pick locks. I fully intend to be the troublemaker aunt
[05:39:42] <grym> Catie: little click out of one 
[05:40:03] <ski> (likewise, "comparative" vs. "diminishing" subtraction can also be useful to distinguish. e.g. "comparing" one point to another, getting a vector, or subtracting a vector from a point, getting another point)

[05:40:28] <Catie> grym: I'm afraid you've lost me on that one
[05:40:38] <bpalmer> ski: the biggest thing in the common core multiplication that I see is a bigger focus on "showing work", which means that someone goign strictly by the book has to decide, given the problem 5x4 , is that groups of 5 drawn 4 times , or groups of 4 drawn 5 times, before the final count operation.
[05:40:46] <aidalgol> Catie: Damn.  My aunts only showed me age-inappropriate TV.
[05:40:49] <grym> Catie: you pick locks and don't also watch LPL occasionally?

[05:41:15] <Catie> grym: Huh, maybe that's why I'm no good at it
[05:41:37] <Catie> aidalgol: Then I guess you've gotta make up for it now and corrupt your own damn self

[05:41:53] <aidalgol> Catie: Way ahead of ya
[05:42:02] <bpalmer> I'm blase about that in the real numbers, although I'm not really one who should be talking; my biggest problem with linear algebra was honestly (and I'm not joking) continually mixing up which were rows and which were columns
[05:42:08] <grym> short, sweet, to the point, and very thorough in the catalogue of things he's destroyed utterly in about 90 seconds 
[05:42:48] <grym> bpalmer: i do that with image coordinates _every damn day_, and "is it rows by columns or columns by rows in numpy" is a close second 
[05:42:55] <grym> and that's like... every day

[05:43:26] <bpalmer> Then I got into ML for a bit, and I kept being careless about notating column vectors vs row vectors.

[05:46:12] <ski> yea .. matrices can be generalized such that the scalars are morphisms in a (additive,iirc ?) category (in which (finite) categorical products and categorical coproducts of objects coincide) .. so a function `f : A0 + A1 >---> B0 * B1 * B2' consists of components `[<f00,f01,f02>,<f10,f11,f12>] = <[f00,f10],[f01,f11],[f02,f12]>', where `fij : Ai >---> Bj' are the scalars ..

[05:50:21] <grym> i'm not exactly sure why cuda won, it's slightly before my time 
[05:50:21] <mfiano> Getting the kernel, metadata format, and userspace tools to all speak the same protocol on Linux is doable, but painful. Nothing like BSD anyway
[05:50:23] <grym> but they did 
[05:50:37] <grym> and they won very decisively 
[05:50:42] <aidalgol> grym: Probably because nvidia created and pushed it before OpenCL got out the door.
[05:51:09] <aidalgol> Catie: And yes, it does have ZFS support, using ZoL, but nixos-rebuild takes care of all that for you, anyway.
[05:52:03] <mfiano> aidalgol: Would you mind sharing your nixos config? I made one about 4 years ago and it didn't stick, but I'd be curious to try it for less painful ZFS support.
[05:52:12] <mfiano> Especially if it supports zfsbootmenu
[05:52:44] <Catie> mfiano: You know, as soon as I saw the lock on the ice cream I knew what would happen
[05:52:54] <mfiano> Catie: :)
[05:54:22] <hodapp> grym: didn't CUDA win because at the time there was basically nothing else for GPGPU but a couple GLSL hacks and some half-assed shader libraries?
[05:54:38] <mfiano> I like his videos because they are often short and comical, and often comical because of how short they are and his typical phrases and mannerisms.
[05:54:50] <grym> hodapp: i think that's most of it.  and then it was adopted by tf and that was pushed super hard and it all kind of adds 
[05:55:07] <hodapp> grym: long before Tensorflow, CUDA was already a fixture

[08:23:32] <meain> I remember once seeing a package which will let you maintain a list of servers(long running processes) for a project and start/manage them from emacs. I can't seem to remember the name now, anyone has got a clue?

[08:38:34] <jladd_rev> Is there a way to have several buffers open but temporarily "zoom" into one (but then revert to having all buffers visible again without having to reopen each individually?)
[08:40:33] <bpalmer> jladd_rev: first, emacs almost always has many many buffers open; buffers are internal structures containing text (and images, etc). Windows are rectangular areas; each window displays a single buffer at a time.  One or more windows fit together in a frame, which is the thing that has borders , a minimize/maximize button, etc in most window managers.

[08:40:56] <bpalmer> jladd_rev: I suspect you are talking about windows; the things you create with C-x 2 and C-x 3 
[08:42:14] <bpalmer> jladd_rev: if so, you could store your current window configuration to a register with C-x r w and then C-x r j to jump back to it
[08:42:24] <bpalmer> jladd_rev: or , you might be interested in a fancier tool like ,,persp

[08:42:26] <fsbot`> [2] git repo: git://github.com/nex3/perspective-el.git
[08:42:57] <bpalmer> ah, I guess persp is a fork of perspective . 
[08:43:51] <bpalmer> if you do the simple built-in approach, you'd store it to a register ( a register is just a single letter from a to z) , then do C-x 1 to show only a single window, and then jump to that register again.
[08:44:33] <bpalmer> there's also ,,eyebrowse,,
[08:44:34] <fsbot`> eyebrowse is [0] a simple window configuration manager

[14:25:11] <empwilli> lol, no wonder I didn't know about it... " at The International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation and Political Violence, described Odysee as "the new YouTube for the far-right", and wrote that although Odysee was "not inherently a platform for far-right or extremist content creators", it had become popular among them"

[14:35:12] <bobdobbs> yeah. I'll try using that
[14:35:36] <bobdobbs> well, I'll try and build an at-least-apparently sane expression with it first
[14:36:02] <Andrew> empwilli: Yeah.  I like peertube better because you can activitypub it toge ther
[14:36:40] <Andrew> By the way, any projects aiming to let users run emacs on bare metal?  Operating systems are bloat

[17:31:08] <Codaraxis__> I'm running Spacemacs. I found it an easy and convenient way to get started, but as I try to further tweak and customize it, I'm encountering increasingly more problems. This is probably due to the sheer number of packages, their interactions, and all the behind-the-scenes settings I don't understand. Has anyone here started with Spacemacs or similar and migrated away to their own configured from the ground up instance of Emacs? If yes, any advice? 
[17:31:08] <Codaraxis__> I'm currently considering having two separate emacs builds so that I can switch back and forth as needed.

[17:32:52] <Codaraxis__> grym, I've found it easy to install new packages. I either install it temporarily with M-x package-install or add it to the dotfile to install permanently. So, very easy
[17:32:54] <grym> then stuff those into a bare init.el 
[17:34:22] <grym> it just keeps a running tally of what functions get executed, and lets you sort / display them by package,mode,whatever

[19:29:39] <corwin> a good general rule is for elisp macros is don't write one until you have a working version using functions instead.  Then seriously ask yourself why it should be a macro instead: the function version is usually fine, even preferable.

[19:34:01] <minifridge>  I think I understand, lisp can get very complicated very fast from my understanding at this point
[19:34:35] <pjb> If you don't want to show the body of the macro, you can indeed just expand to a function call. (defmacro foo (var expr &body body) `(call-foo (lambda (,var) ,@body) ,expr))
[19:35:31] <pjb> this function call, with lambda, will just explicit how the parameters of the macro are to be used (var will be used as a variable binding, expr will be evaluated, etc.)
[19:35:48] <edrx> I almost never write macros - I'm the opposite of corwin, he's written tons of them - but I have to understand macros written by other people quite often... and my favorite tool for that is function that expands a call to a macro with macroexpand and pretty-prints the result

[20:55:15] <hartmannathan> Ah, I see. Thanks so much!
[20:55:57] <rpav> probaby the more useful thing is that, () are not metacharacters without \, so they don't need escaped at all; then you don't need ot escape \ when entering directly

[20:58:55] <hartmannathan> Ah I see... In re-builder, this seems to match it: throwSystemError\(\\(.*?\\)\)
[20:59:04] <hartmannathan> So, one additional level of escaping there.
[20:59:16] <rpav> yeah it tends to generate stuff suitable for strings or something
[20:59:50] <hartmannathan> Ok so somehow I probably need to setup re-builder to use whatever replace-regexp is using
[20:59:57] <corwin> there are options within regexp-builder to control it but by default, yes, it assumes you are creating an RegExp for use in an elisp string.

[21:03:44] <rpav> ok re-builder is not the one that does python/pcre/etc and "string" syntax seems to be suitable for building "what you would type in the minibuffer"
[21:03:54] <rpav> but C-c C-w still copies the escaped version
[21:04:25] <rpav> really i think the better option for re-builder is to add keys to the mode that take the regex and use it for search/replace/etc directly
[21:05:17] <rpav> actually i guess it has keys bound for iterating matches, so if it had one for "now replace all matches with .." it would be pretty handy .. you can always copy the string _yourself_ and get the right thing, but so many steps

[22:38:46] <Catie> You know what, StumpWM can do that too. I'm just now learning this
[22:40:19] <Unicorn_Princess> helm-swoop search can get laggy when searching through a large buffer. i suppose the results being slow to load is inevitable, but the problem is the lag affects the input box too, making it hard to edit the search expression. is there a fix?
[22:40:20] <ecraven> technomancy: how do you get emacs bindings in firefox? exwm simulation keys?
[22:40:27] <technomancy> ecraven: yeah
[22:40:43] <technomancy> it saved my career
[22:40:54] <crazazy> twrk: nvm fixed my problem
[22:40:56] <ecraven> I've been playing around with tightly integrating surf or nyxt into emacs, but surf can't do everything I want, and nyxt isn't very amenable to being remote controlled :-/
[22:41:17] <technomancy> ecraven: what do you do about security updates?
[22:41:32] <Catie> Unicorn_Princess: That's probably something to do with Emacs being single-threaded, I would think. Magit has been slowing down my session, and during those pauses I can't even complain about it on IRC in another frame
[22:41:59] <Unicorn_Princess> single-threaded, still? ; ;
[22:42:01] <ecraven> technomancy: I'm not using them much yet.. I want noscript support, but that isn't possible from *outside* webkit, you have to write a javascript extension for it, or patch webkit
[22:42:05] <Catie> Single-threaded forever
[22:42:14] <technomancy> ecraven: bleaugh
[22:42:22] <ecraven> not sure why, but webkit does *not* just raise a Qt signal for each resource it wants to load, which would make this really easy to do
[22:42:27] <technomancy> someone needs to make a netsurf frontend with emacs keys
[22:42:38] * technomancy glances around the channel
[22:42:52] <wasamasa> meh
[22:42:53] <ecraven> nothing I have to do at work works with netsurf, I believe... without javascript, it's just a lost cause
[22:43:10] <technomancy> ecraven: so why do you care about noscript?
[22:43:15] <wasamasa> I decided to write some weird elisp code and after finishing some trivial stuff, I'm hitting the frustrating parts immediately
[22:43:29] <Unicorn_Princess> well not that i'm going to do this, but: would it be theoretically possible to have elisp start a separate process that would do the searching, and the main thread would periodically poll it for results, so the main emacs can remain responsive?
[22:43:36] <ecraven> technomancy: I want to *decide* which javascript to allow
[22:43:36] <wasamasa> I'm trying to connect and communicate with a unix socket
[22:43:49] <technomancy> wasamasa: I got fennel code running inside the emacs process with that native module btw =D

[22:44:30] <wasamasa> ah, yes, C
[22:44:42] <Unicorn_Princess> oh, a simpler fix: is it possible to make helm-swoop wait for somekinda confirmation key before it launches a search?
[22:44:55] <technomancy> the biggest problem is you can't invoke `message` or `read-from-minibuffer` from the lua side

[23:30:43] <wasamasa> > The lifetime of an environment is finite; its beginning and end is described below, in the sections that describe how modules can obtain pointers to environment objects. Modules mustn’t dereference environment pointers or pass them to module API functions outside of the lifetime of the environments they represent.
[23:30:45] <bpalmer> I mean, other programming languages have to do the same basic thing, they just make it look prettier.
[23:30:51] <rudybot> technomancy: I recently came accross Lemon, the parser generator specifically designed for SQLite. Now there's the CVS. I'm beginning to suspect SQLite is the accidental byproduct of a project meant to reinvent programming from scratch.

[23:31:58] <corwin> so, that's 50% accuracy then?  By NPM standards, pretty good I guess
[23:32:01] <bpalmer> technomancy: you could also write your function so that its messages get spooled to some in-memory structure, and the next event in the module unspools these to the environment.
