[01:07:03] <pystardust> mysticbtw[m]: I updated transmission-cli by using aur which builds from source, there is a recent build which would get metadata when paused

[14:14:40] <mysticbtw[m]> I didnt ask for metadata.
[14:14:40] <mysticbtw[m]> I asked on how to exclude some files in a torrent to not download
[14:15:15] <mysticbtw[m]> Even if i set priority to low it downloads those files.
[14:15:15] <mysticbtw[m]> In Tremc 
[14:15:24] <mysticbtw[m]> * In Tremc or remote
[14:18:55] <pystardust> oh, for me when i do -G all -g 1,2 then it only downloads index 1 and 2
[14:26:11] <mysticbtw[m]> ohh Will give it a go
[14:31:18] <mysticbtw[m]> Will it continue to see with the file i have downloaded or will it just keep idle torrent?
[14:31:54] <mysticbtw[m]> Oops. No luck.
[14:31:54] <mysticbtw[m]> It downloaded it again even after that command
[14:41:14] <pystardust> mysticbtw[m]: downloaded what again? the other files?
[14:42:22] <pystardust> because of how torrents work, If you want say file A, then you might get a small part of file B, since a piece that contains file A contains that part of file B, you would need to ignore that small part

[18:52:04] <mysticbtw[m]> I mean, suppose i want to download a video file.
[18:52:04] <mysticbtw[m]> Torrent folder has also this exe, nfo files from rarbg.
[18:52:04] <mysticbtw[m]> My question is how to exclude those files and only have mkv files for that torrent as yet seed with that only
[18:52:28] <mysticbtw[m]> Same with subtitles folder with a movie
[19:07:40] <pystardust> so first you pause the torrent, then you do `-G all`, then do `-f` to get a list of files, choose the index and then do `-g 1,2` where 1 and 2 are the index of the required files

[20:28:56] <Arya[m]> hello
[20:29:06] <Arya[m]> I am making a install script for my dots lo
[20:29:13] <Arya[m]> s/lo/lol/
[20:30:09] <gtlsgamr> me and pystardust are working on a homedir cleaning script. You can contribute too! --> https://github.com/gtlsgamr/tidytilde
[20:30:20] <Arya[m]> wow nicwe
[20:32:59] <Arya[m]> ssh cant be done?
[20:33:09] <gtlsgamr> Unfortunately, no :(
[20:34:36] <Arya[m]> i will tell some of my directories... (full message at https://libera.ems.host/_matrix/media/r0/download/libera.chat/47c354bb343c8e4f1a99541002b5773f6d08a7b7)
[20:34:58] <Arya[m]> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2924697/how-does-one-output-bold-text-in-bash/2924755 Wow the terminal isnt that bad
[20:35:03] <Arya[m]> we can do bold in a tty
[20:35:07] <Arya[m]> never new that ðŸ˜›
[20:36:25] <gtlsgamr> Arya[m]: You can contribute to the project too. Go to ---> https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/XDG_Base_Directory and then set up the config for the directories that you want.
[20:36:36] <gtlsgamr> That link has ways to move dotfiles
[20:36:43] <Arya[m]> ok
[20:48:19] <Arya[m]> sent PR for vim
[20:53:08] <gtlsgamr> Wrong PR buddy
[20:53:12] <gtlsgamr> wrong code
[20:53:41] <pystardust> Arya[m]: "~/.vim" won't expand to home because of quotes u gotta do something like "$HOME/.vim" or ~/.vim
[20:54:06] <Arya[m]> ok
[20:54:42] <pystardust> also you need ;; after each case statement. Try testing the code to check if it works
[20:54:48] <Arya[m]> oof forgot
[20:59:57] <Arya[m]> gtlsgamr: FOr the gitconfig the dir is not even made yet
[21:00:03] <Arya[m]> mv: cannot move '/home/ak/.gitconfig' to '/home/ak/.config/git/config': No such file or directory
[21:00:38] <gtlsgamr> That's the beauty of opensource! Fix it and submit a PR. Also dont run the script randomly, IT COMES WITH ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY
[21:00:53] <Arya[m]> I inspected it ðŸ˜›
[21:01:07] <Arya[m]> gtlsgamr: free software
[21:01:24] <gtlsgamr> Does it matteR?
[21:01:38] <Arya[m]> ya ig it would for stallman ðŸ™‚
[21:01:52] <gtlsgamr> fuck stallman! ðŸ¤  
[21:02:06] <Arya[m]> lol
[21:02:23] <Arya[m]> you may have angered a large part of this grp
[21:03:06] <gtlsgamr> Fuck them too! ðŸ˜‰ 
[21:05:50] <Arya[m]> its .rustup not ~/rustup lol

[21:08:30] <gtlsgamr> Nope you right

[21:08:41] <Arya[m]> lol
[21:10:57] <Arya[m]> everything seems to be working
[21:11:00] <Arya[m]> you can merge it
[22:50:41] <Mudskipper875[m]> <Arya[m]> "Just a small thing i found about..." <- ```
[22:50:41] <Mudskipper875[m]> command! W execute 'w !sudo tee % > /dev/null' <bar> edit!
[22:50:41] <Mudskipper875[m]> ```
[22:50:41] <Mudskipper875[m]> Add this to your .vimrc
[22:51:26] <Mudskipper875[m]> Arya then you can save with :W
[22:52:10] <Mudskipper875[m]> <gtlsgamr> "me and pystardust are working on..." <- This is a very nice Idea !!
