[06:53:06] <estranger> it's relative 
[06:53:33] <Sousapro> 10 percent of 30k annually is very doable

[06:57:55] <Church> I've got $25k~ of options at a $0.50 strike price roughly by the time I get my options grant
[06:58:08] <estranger> damn my strike is $3
[06:58:21] <Church> And from the previous company it was... roughly the same amount of shares at a $0.32 strike.
[06:58:23] <catbeard> diversify yo bondz
[06:58:30] <shakygator> is everyone at the company gonna quit estranger 
[06:58:31] <Church> That netted me $92k~ in the buyout
[06:58:42] <estranger> I need about $100k to exercise it all ha
[06:58:46] <Church> Which was nice. Curious to see what Saucelabs gets me.
[06:59:03] <estranger> shakygator no we're all very bullish
[06:59:19] <shakygator> hoping to make it 10m eh
[06:59:31] <estranger> and can still earn equity, and buy stocks at a discount
[06:59:47] <shakygator> i sold all my grants to diversify
[07:00:00] <shakygator> missed the covid crash by literally a day too
[07:00:05] <estranger> I'd be dumb to sell at this point imo

[07:01:49] <shakygator> yeah me too. i will have to liquidate my tax account investments to put a down payment on a new home. but then when i sell this house ill get 100k+
[07:01:50] <Sousapro> Nice
[07:01:56] <Sousapro> I should buy a house
[07:02:04] <catbeard> you wouldn't download a house

[07:02:10] <shakygator> then im gonna take 100k and re-invest it
[07:02:10] <catbeard> "the fuck i wouldn't"
[07:02:11] <estranger> move away from the area a bit where land js cheap and build custom
[07:02:19] <estranger> housing here is insane
[07:02:26] <Sousapro> catbeard: yes I would. 3d printed or ramdirt house
[07:02:29] <shakygator> look at barndomoniums

[07:02:47] <shakygator> mine did too, but it took 10 years
[07:02:53] <Sousapro> But those are expensive now 
[07:02:54] <estranger> brb
[07:03:03] <catbeard> it's just 450k$, just save up with minimum wage you loser /s
[07:03:13] <Sousapro> I'm getting to the point where I want to buy a van and live in it
[07:03:50] <Sousapro> Has to be better than paying a mortgage in rent

[07:04:34] <Sousapro> Price for 10+ year old mcmansion $500k
[07:04:49] <Sousapro> That cost $200k new
[07:05:18] <Sousapro> But their body leavings and weather based aging somehow makes it worth 2x
[07:05:52] <Sousapro> So I can buy a 60 year old house that's the size of my apartment 
[07:06:31] <Church> God I'm looking at Rockland County NY
[07:06:44] <Church> And finding a place for only $350k hurtsss

[07:07:31] <catbeard> sure would be a shitty time for a tax audit
[07:07:45] <Church> Hmm for who?
[07:07:53] <Church> Me? Probably. But my taxes are simple heh

[18:11:00] <csws> PublicWiFi, i've got some lame personal project, basically frontend for an API that my bank provides and my challenge is no javascript
[18:11:14] <PublicWiFi> yuck
[18:11:21] <PublicWiFi> javascript makes it SO EASY
[18:11:31] <csws> so I used bulma as that framework doesn't require js and just do everything the old fashioned way with lots of forms lol
[18:11:43] <csws> damn it renders fast tho
[18:12:02] <PublicWiFi> im sure it does
[18:12:17] <PublicWiFi> lucky in my case my internal page is like 1 form with 7 inputs lol
[18:12:20] <PublicWiFi> 2 forms*
[18:12:31] <PublicWiFi> ugly and basic but she works
[18:12:46] <csws> hmmm

[18:12:54] <csws> for good measure
[18:12:57] <PublicWiFi> oh yeah
[18:13:03] <PublicWiFi> i need it to take a least 5 seconds to load the page
[18:13:10] <PublicWiFi> otherwise is it even a real website?
[18:13:21] <PublicWiFi> let me import like 50 libraries

[18:14:46] <gibby> I'm extra gassy today
[18:14:47] <csws> yeah tempting to put a feature in my IRC bot to get the canonical link for amp urls
[18:14:49] <csws> they piss me off
[18:14:54] <PublicWiFi> yeah its shitty
[18:15:10] <PublicWiFi> there's a reddit bot that does it when it sees an amp link
[18:15:13] <PublicWiFi> kinda nice
[18:15:31] <PublicWiFi> imagine having to make 2 copies of every page you make
[18:15:33] <PublicWiFi> just to make google happy
[18:15:54] <csws> guessing all these news sites use CMS software to handle that anyway
[18:19:49] <PublicWiFi> probably
[18:21:45] <JollyRgrs> PublicWiFi: i'm pretty sure everyone reading their news from google's news reader (swipe to left from android home screen) or from the mobile chrome "new tab" page will all be AMP links

[18:25:40] <PublicWiFi> whys that

[21:36:06] <sd> 13<C​olour> What if they don't have a bloody smartphone
[21:36:42] <signofzeta> Security Defaults is wonderful, though it does break authenticated scan-to-email.  You have to use Direct Send and modify SPF to make it work, which isn't *too* terrible.
[21:37:05] <CptLuxx> maybe more devices will support oauth in the future
[21:37:26] <signofzeta> However, my biggest client at my last job used a lot of authenticated SMTP, so we had to manually enforce MFA for users and urge them to use MS Authenticator.
[21:38:05] <sd> 13<C​olour> What did you do if they didn't have a smartphone haha
[21:39:06] <signofzeta> Everyone either had one or was given one.
[21:39:19] <signofzeta> But yes, that's a problem with Security Defaults.  Almost everyone can get a text.

[21:42:00] <signofzeta> You can also use the Authenticator app as a token.
