[03:56:32] <Grinnz> well that function call doesn't really make any sense anyway
[03:56:48] <Grinnz> what are you trying to pass to it?
[03:57:02] <elein> Which function call, Grinnz?  The call to parse_file?
[03:57:14] <Grinnz> "$report$var{'suffix'} " || die "Bad report name _ $report _ " is a nonsensical argument
[03:58:11] <Grinnz> if you're trying to form a filename the trailing space would break that, and the die will never happen because a string with a trailing space can't be false
[03:58:13] <elein> OK, but I am not getting that error, I am getting the error after the || "Cannot parse Bad report..."
[03:58:23] <Grinnz> what are you trying to pass to it?
[03:58:56] <elein> I will change that first or die.  I am trying to pass in a file name with a suffix, e.g. tablelist.xml.
[03:59:07] <Grinnz> ok, a filename is not a glob
[03:59:29] <Grinnz> you don't want to pass a glob
[03:59:51] <Grinnz> but you do have to pass the correct filename, and i guarantee the trailing space isn't correct

[05:24:55] <pts> does perl have int32+32 != int33 issue?
[05:25:37] <xq> example?
[05:25:41] <xq> also, what is int33?
[05:25:52] <Grinnz> perl usually uses 64 bit ints
[05:26:21] <pts> douglas crockford is talking about a bug in java where adding two int32 would yield an int33
[05:26:40] <leitz> Is is generally better for a sub to return a hash or a hashref?
[05:26:56] <xq> you can't return a hash
[05:26:58] <pts> douglas_crockford_numbers.mp4
[05:27:03] <Grinnz> not exactly how it works in perl, but if the result of an addition is too large for 64 bit ints you'll get a float and have to deal with that imprecision
[05:27:07] <xq> if you try, it gets flattened
[05:27:14] <Grinnz> 64 bit ints are obviously much larger so this is rare
[05:27:31] <Grinnz> but you can use Math::BigInt if you need arbitrary precision ints
[05:27:38] <Grinnz> it's just a lot slower
[05:28:13] <leitz> xq, but if the hash is flattened, and is given to a hash on the right side, it seems to be rebuilt.
[05:28:16] <Grinnz> leitz: sub args and return values can only be 0 or more scalars
[05:28:24] <Grinnz> yes, because you assigned that list to another hash
[05:28:27] <xq> yes, that's exactly what happens
[05:28:53] <Grinnz> so hashrefs for args and return values avoid that reconstruction in both direction
[05:28:54] <Grinnz> s
[05:29:03] <xq> I wonder if perl internally is smart enough to avoid copies during that
[05:29:11] <Grinnz> it has to copy the SVs at least
[05:29:20] <Grinnz> but it's smart about copying
[05:29:37] <xq> but still, if it's hashes then the (cryptographic) hashes will need to be recalculated
[05:29:45] <Grinnz> yes, i'm pretty sure that's unavoidable
[05:30:05] <xq> this seems unfortunate
[05:30:11] <Grinnz> but perl uses pretty efficient hashing functions of course
[05:30:12] <leitz> Then do you wrap the sub call in %{ hashy_thing() } so that the return is dereferenced?
[05:30:24] <Grinnz> that just means you're copying it after it's returned instead
[05:30:37] <Grinnz> would make no difference to the returning a list case
[05:30:50] *** Joins: akaWolf (~akaWolf@akawolf.org)
[05:31:00] <Grinnz> if you need a hash variable directly there's no alternative, but you can just use a reference anywhere you would use a hash
[05:31:10] <xq> leitz: anyway my point is if you return a hashref you can avoid copying and recalculation
[05:31:26] <xq> so if  you need to do that a million times a second you should give that a thought
[05:31:34] <pts> i wish i learned more math in school
[05:32:04] <leitz> I need ease of reading performance more than I need CPU cycle performance.

[05:33:57] <leitz> Grinnz, I'm still going over your notes about removing local::lib. It'll take me a bit to really understand it though.
[05:33:59] <Grinnz> leitz: yeah this only matters for large structures or commonly repeated tasks
[05:34:25] <Grinnz> like a subroutine you call thousands of times
[05:34:25] <mason> In all seriousness, why remove local::lib?
[05:34:36] <Grinnz> because he's using a setup that doesn't need it
[05:34:42] <mason> ah
[05:34:44] <mason> kk
[05:34:58] <leitz> mason, I've made a mess between OS perl and CPAN modules. Need to clean it up.
[05:35:09] <mason> local::lib is a sanity saver in lots of instances. I end up recommending it to folks who pollute their system packaging beyond repair.

[05:35:21] <Grinnz> in your homedir yeah.
[05:35:26] <leitz> And that clean up will break a lot of things that I need to fix.
[05:35:28] <mason> leitz: That's the case where I tend to recommend local::lib
[05:36:07] <Grinnz> not for installing to the perl's sitelib.
[05:36:17] <leitz> mason, I don't like the idea of installing in my homedir, that's why I used local::lib. I just didn't use it well.  :(
[05:37:02] <Grinnz> basically local::lib is for installing to a non-default lib location, not a default lib location
[05:37:49] <xq> I don't think I've ever used local::lib, ever
[05:38:10] <mason> leitz: Think of local::lib as being a nice way to let you have custom environments and module sets per application, controlled by environment variables.
[05:38:11] <leitz> I'm at the point of thinking I need to build perl.
[05:38:24] <xq> still don't understand why would anyone prefer it instead of perlbrew
[05:38:39] <leitz> mason, I really dislike the custom environments and brew stuff.
[05:38:40] <xq> but everytime I ask it become some sort of political discussion
[05:39:24] <Grinnz> xq: different use cases - whether you want a separate perl or just a place to install modules for an existing perl
[05:39:27] <mason> xq: Never heard of it before today, but anything that starts with curl into bash is not off to a good start.
[05:39:30] <Grinnz> both use cases are perfectly valid
[05:39:51] <xq> mason: apt show perlbrew, yum info perlbrew
[05:39:53] <Grinnz> mason: not necessary, just the only way anyone can get newbies to install stuff, such is life
[05:40:11] <xq> Grinnz: "existing perl" is not a thing
[05:40:16] <leitz> I agree; brew and Carton have their place. 
[05:40:29] <xq> not for me at least, and not in any sane (in my view) setup
[05:40:29] <leitz> Just not on my computer.   :)
[05:41:00] <Grinnz> xq: if you mean it shouldn't ideally be used, sure
[05:41:07] <xq> if the perl is available and you did not install it 1) it's not there for you 2) it's in unknown state aka vendorperl
[05:41:20] *** Joins: todd (~todd@gateway/tor-sasl/toddf)
[05:41:22] <xq> aka install your own perl
[05:41:27] <Grinnz> but if you limit your use to a local::lib it's generally fine
[05:41:37] <xq> *shrug*
[05:41:40] *** orange97 is now known as icecoldjava37
[05:41:42] <Grinnz> of course i would recommend installing your own perl for any development or production purpose
[05:41:49] <xq> yes
[05:41:53] <xq> hence perlbrew
[05:41:55] <Grinnz> for hobby purposes, do whatever you want
[05:42:25] <xq> < leitz> mason, I really dislike the custom environments and brew stuff.
[05:42:29] <xq> reality #1
[05:42:48] <xq> in production, 2 perl application should run on 2 different perls
[05:43:05] <xq> so as updating one and its dependencies does not break another
[05:43:07] <mason> xq: I've argued on both sides of that at different points in life.
[05:43:11] <xq> reality #2
[05:43:25] <xq> perl is already based on 'custome environments'
[05:43:43] <Grinnz> for development you want to install your own perl so you can use the latest perl and versions of cpan modules
[05:43:47] <xq> its behavior is based on 4 (I think? or 3?) environment variables
[05:44:01] <Grinnz> for production you want to install your own perl so you aren't beholden to the package manager for stability of your app
[05:44:04] <leitz> I've done production support for a while, and if you have two applications using a non-system language, the application people need to supply the entire language.
[05:44:09] <Grinnz> (and use carton, on top of that)
[05:44:19] <xq> PERL5LIB and friends; 
[05:44:53] <xq> so if you are using perl you are already using 'environment'; it's a matter of which one you use - one you setup yourself or one provided by perl install (eg vendorperl)

[17:41:33] <leitz> I'm trying to organize my tests better, so that the testing var data is in __DATA__.
[17:42:45] <lopid> i don't think you can execute content from __DATA__ without evaling it

[17:59:43] <leitz> lopid, nothing yet. I'm trying to fix that.
[17:59:45] <lopid> or do you mean it is currently unused, and you want to use it?
[17:59:47] <lopid> ah
[18:00:11] <lopid> then just as xq says, why not move it in into the code?
[18:00:18] <xq> it will not improve anything in my opinion
[18:00:38] <xq> just put my $word_list_report = { ... at the top of file and be done with it
[18:00:59] <xq> what could be improved however about that file is the testing function used
[18:01:34] <xq> instead of ok($A == $B) you can use is($A, $B)
[18:01:52] <xq> it handles undef if needed
[18:02:23] <xq> and to force a specific comparison you can use cmp_ok($A, 'some compare operator', $B)
[18:02:55] <xq> the improvement that this grants is that when the tests fail the error message will be more descriptive (try it)
[18:08:59] <BlueShark> pts: was afk. yeah, lopid is right. we can only control the value of $input, rest cannot be changed.
[18:09:16] <BlueShark> pts: also, backticks aren't in the regex, so it'll be removed.

[18:16:55] <lopid> rather than changing the actual code logic, i'd use some code folding in my editor of choice, because really, you have a display issue
[18:18:49] <xq> instead of a variable you could put all your testdata pieces in constants

[23:22:36] <Grinnz> $< or $> to check the current user is fine imo. anything beyond that is asking for confusion
[23:23:20] <Grinnz> and confusion is not a great thing when dealing with this stuff
[23:23:51] <Grinnz> for example, if you do assign to $< or $( or anything, you have to reset $! first and check it afterward to determine if it succeeded
[23:24:12] <Grinnz> because there's no "error condition return value" and of course it won't throw an exceptin
[23:24:15] <Grinnz> exception
[23:24:37] <Grinnz> setuid and setgid don't throw exceptions either but at least they have a clear error state
[23:25:06] <Grinnz> and you want to set both real and effective in this sort of case, if you just set effective then it's possible for the process to revert to root
[23:25:21] <Grinnz> setuid and setgid do that
[23:25:41] <Grinnz> (set both)
