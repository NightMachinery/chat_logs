[00:03:18] <Modx3> i never used javascript before 
[00:03:20] <piou> meh, passing the password through the URL is bad, but I don't see any hashing being done here
[00:03:54] <Modx3> i don't know what is happening 
[00:04:17] <Modx3> is there a way to brute force this ?
[00:04:55] <piou> 1) so where exactly did you see that hash? 2) bruteforce what?
[00:05:03] *** Joins: chiselfuse (~chiselfus@user/chiselfuse)
[00:05:18] <Modx3> maybe its not a hash i don't know 
[00:05:21] <piou> were you intercepting traffic maybe when you saw it?
[00:06:28] <Modx3> brute force the login web page 
[00:07:42] *** Joins: chasmo77 (~chas77@71.63.241.168)
[00:08:17] <piou> I mean, bruteforce is always an option, the question of whether it's practical is another thing, but on a little router I expect it to be. Where did you see the "maybe hash but we're not sure yet"?
[00:11:34] <Modx3> when i tried to login i intercept the traffic this is the body request

[00:15:38] <piou> Modx3: it's strange that you don't see a request to login.cgi with the username password first
[00:15:41] <Modx3> https://pastebin.com/4DjzPsRr
[00:16:21] <piou> But it's fun to see enckey here, looks like an encryption key, so that wouldn't be a hash but something like AES maybe
[00:17:31] <piou> Ah, yeah, in that last page you linked, line 93 and forward

[15:16:59] <tsujp> I'm learning about basic ciphers and I understand a monoalphabetic cipher but I'm having trouble trying to find the name of an example I've been given. It's monoalphabetic but uses a key which is a word such that the next letter in the alphabet after the last letter of the key is continued on in order to form the substitution alphabet. Here's an example paste (4 lines): http://ix.io/3ygI
[15:17:34] <tsujp> So the key is MARKET and after T comes U, so continue alphabetically from U (while not including any letter already used in MARKET) so U, V, W, X, Y ... until all 26 places have been filled
[15:17:42] <tsujp> Is there a name for this particular monoalphabetic cipher?
[15:33:51] <Wulf> tsujp: hello

[15:35:32] <maroon> tsujp i dont understand how your ciphertext is calculated - and i'm sure you agree that a real cipher would never include the key as a literal part of the published ciphertext
[15:36:51] <maroon> looks like your ciphertext is re-arranging the alphabet similarly to the way the *key* (not ciphertext) is done in the playfair cipher
[15:36:52] <tsujp> Perhaps it was used purely for demonstrations sake
[15:37:53] <Wulf> scheme looks familiar to me
[15:38:06] <maroon> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playfair_cipher
[15:38:10] <piou> maroon: it's a substitution cipher similar to cesar (or keyed cesar rather), if you put the alphabet in a cesar cipher then your ciphertext is just the corresponding alphabet shifted, that's the same thing here
[15:38:42] <piou> Don't see it as a ciphertext, see it as the list of associated letter
[15:38:49] <maroon> but that's not what his 'ciphertext' is doing, it instead is the word MARKET followed by the alphabet portion that excludes those 6 letters
[15:39:02] <piou> maroon: no, you're not considering the plaintext
[15:39:11] <maroon> which is what playfair does while building the 5-by-5 key square
[15:39:47] <maroon> there's no relationship between his ciphertext and plaintext, other than a one-time-pad
[15:40:04] <piou> With that cipher, "plaintext" would become "FLMWCJEPJ" and "abcdefg" would become "MARKETU"
[15:40:14] <maroon> his 'ciphertext' is really the 'key' expanded to include the whole alphabet
[15:40:26] <piou> it's not a good cihpertext by any means, but it doesn't claim to be
[15:40:39] <piou> it's just a small variation on a keyed cesar
[15:41:40] <piou> keyed cesar would be that ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ maps to MARKETBCDFGHIJLNOPQSUVWXYZ
[15:41:53] <piou> (well, the most commonly seen keyed cesar at least)
[15:42:13] *** Joins: dez (uid92154@user/dez)
[15:42:15] <maroon> looking at it that way, it would be perhaps similar to the thomas jefferson code wheel
[15:43:07] <tsujp> So I presume the correct term here is I have some starting alphabet ABCDEFGH ... and using the key I produce a new alphabet MARKETU ... which this keyed caeser then uses?
[15:43:20] <tsujp> As in, the correct labels for `plaintext` and `ciphertext` in my incorrect paste
[15:43:33] <piou> I mean, it's a subset of what's possible with a code wheel
[15:45:30] <piou> tsujp: the association of "regular letter" to "encrypted letter" is called a mapping. A plaintext is a message you want to send, unencrypted. A ciphertext is an encrypted message. It just happens that, since your cipher is a letter-by-letter substitution, if your plaintext is the alphabet in order then your ciphertext will be the corresponding mapping to use for encryption/decryption
[15:45:47] <piou> tsujp: so it's not incorrect, but I think your labels are mistakenly correct
[15:48:43] <maroon> so your pastebin should need 3 lines, top line is plaintext, the 2nd line renamed as 'key', and a 3rd line shows the ciphertext which uses the key to map the plaintext into differing characters

[15:55:53] <piou> tsujp: Caesar (which I often spell Cesar because I'm not english) was one of the first ciphers used and it had the advantage that you didn't need to give much to the recipient: just by knowing the principle of caesar and the shift you had used it was possible to reconstruct the full mapping and decrypt the message. But there are only 25 such shifts, so people began trying new ways to exploit the
[15:55:59] <piou> idea, and shifting some letters to the beginning then listing the remaining ones in order became somewhat popular. It still only required to know a word and the principle but there were much more possibilities. One issue of that method though is that the last letters of the alphabet were often untouched. Take my mapping for MARKET with the traditionnal method above: MARKETBCDFGHIJLNOPQSUVWXYZ As
[15:56:02] <maroon> right piou, this makes it look like the http://practicalcryptography.com/ciphers/monoalphabetic-substitution-category/simple-substitution/ monoalphabetic substitution cipher
[15:56:05] <piou> you can see everything from U to Z is untouched: these letters will not be shifted. So for any message, without knowing the key you knew you had a very good chance that a Z was a Z, a good chance that a Y was a Y etc with decreasing probability. The method you describe that continues the alphabet starting from the last letter of the key is interesting because it solves this problem.
[15:56:45] <piou> maroon: it is a monoalphabetic substitution cipher, that was literally in the first sentence of tsujp 
[15:56:57] <maroon> though this has the vulnerability as having a frequency distribution identical to the plaintext, which playfair tries to disguise by doing the same thing against pairs of letters instead of single letters
[15:57:16] <piou> like any monoalphabetic substitution cipher
[15:57:32] <piou> As to what that variation is called, I don't know
