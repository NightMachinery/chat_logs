[00:22:52] <hovercat> meaningless banter.
[00:24:59] <hovercat> When someone is vital to your heart, your smile, an act of nature with causation of you joy and purpose, they can become exactly opposite, turning love to poison. Causation of experience of joy turns to sour regret and vulnerability. Some say better to have loved and lost, than never loved at all. Others will curse existence because love set the barometer so high that nothing else can meet the
[00:25:05] <hovercat> challenge, of replacing its abscense.
[00:26:24] <hovercat> I hold no soul in contempt, of being a product of its own nature to love, and hating everything for it.
[00:28:30] <hovercat> I smile when I see people bicker and froth about trivial things that have no purpose, than having an idea or possible ability to relate, to the misery I've known.

[00:31:35] <hovercat> The only thing I can see, staying off the anguish of lost love is more love. Quite the fickle cycle of insanity, history repeating itself over and over or unto, condemnation and termination of desire.

[13:19:21] <blkshp> They're definitely demising here.
[13:20:02] <blkshp> I did a mask count in the local indoor shopping centre about masks, 257 without 114 with
[13:20:08] <arryana> yeesh
[13:20:30] <arryana> kids are still unvaccinated, and so are those under chemo and similar.  it's fucked up to put them in jeopardy for no reason.
[13:21:21] <blkshp> they've also removed the one way system (which was being followed to a point) and removed all the warnign signs from the floors and walls.
[13:21:29] <arryana> sigh
[13:21:30] <blkshp> I guess having the floor shiny again was more important.
[13:21:47] <arryana> delusional childish people want to pretend it's over because they're tired of it
[13:21:53] <arryana> waaah, i want reality to be different!
[13:22:32] <blkshp> Ok, not to be clear, i do think that at some point we need to get back to a semblance of normal at some point, but it did strike me as very strange that as soon as that 19th hit, they were all on their hands and knees, literally from that morning, removing the signs
[13:23:38] <blkshp> And one of the staff in a wetherspoons, almost encouraged me not to wear a mask inside and pointed me to the bar, the outdoor food ordering has gone from the app as have all but one NHS track and trace QR code
[13:24:32] <arryana> i guess i'm biased on this one.
[13:24:39] <arryana> i used to drive the ambulance in new york city, as an emt
[13:25:08] <arryana> i know what more than 30 bodies on a road look like.  the idea of jeopardizing lives because a mask is slightly unpleasant is unconscionable to me
[13:25:58] <blkshp> Indeed, i want to smash the ones in the face that wear it under their nose. They, to me are worse than the ones that dont wear one at all
[13:26:17] <blkshp> At least the ones not wearing one at all are not pretending so they can look like they give a fuck.
[13:27:10] <blkshp> After all this time, wearing a good medical grade mask, i don't even feel it anymore
[13:27:28] <arryana> idiots, agreed
[13:27:32] <arryana> and dangerous idiots
[13:28:37] <arryana> but selfishness and entitlement are a rampant poison these days
[13:30:09] <arryana> that's the part of religion that society is suffering for, community good
[13:30:54] <arryana> i'm unspeakably grateful to be old, i remember a better time.  nobody was so important that they could be above the rules.
[13:31:23] <arryana> these days throwing a tantrum and declaring oneself a victim is enough justification to be a total asshole.
[13:32:55] <Ungwelian> One of my family members is a corona anti-vaxxer.
[13:33:00] <Ungwelian> It's pretty difficult :F

[13:35:44] <krb> my wife from the Philippines is sort of suffering from anti vax ideas as well
[13:35:50] <Ungwelian> :/
[13:36:53] <krb> it's mythological cancer, just like religion
[13:38:02] <spruit11> my ex,  mother of kids,  had the same.  but my kids convinced her
[13:38:22] <Ungwelian> One of the new ones is this idea, that vaccines cause blood clots. While that is true for some, corona _also_ causes blood clots at a higher rate.
[13:38:43] <Ungwelian> But it's always just one-side of the story for them.
[13:39:30] <Ungwelian> How did the kids manage to do that? :)
[13:39:39] <blkshp> In 2 days i am at my '2 weeks from 2nd jab' full immunity. And I can go clubbing... wait, i didn't go clubbing before corona! xD
[13:39:52] <spruit11> it's heparin-induced trombosis I think and very rare.  like 1:250.000
[13:40:02] <arryana> haha
[13:40:07] <arryana> too true, blkshp
[13:40:10] <blkshp> It's the smell¬
[13:40:12] <blkshp> lol
[13:40:51] <Ungwelian> Even if you get both vaccines and the 2 weeks, you won't get full immunity.
[13:40:56] <arryana> a former bandmate of my other half isn't speaking to us anymore, because he wanted to visit the day after england lifted lockdown
[13:40:59] <arryana> and we said no
[13:41:06] <blkshp> 95%
[13:41:10] <Ungwelian> You can still get the corona and also become a carrier.
[13:41:15] <Ungwelian> And then spread it.
[13:41:36] <blkshp> Yes, I am aware
[13:41:41] <Atque> Ungwelian: What about if you get four vaccines with two doses each: pfizer, astrazeneca, j&j and sinovax?
[13:41:54] * Ungwelian shrugs
[13:41:56] <Atque> Ungwelian: Can I go clubbing without potentially killing people then?
[13:42:18] <Ungwelian> Probably not, because none of them has been designed vs. delta.
[13:42:28] <spruit11> we'll probably get a booster against delta yah
[13:42:59] <Ungwelian> It's infuriating, because even if that's done, there'll be a new variant still.
[13:43:09] <spruit11> or not.  will need to see
[13:43:16] <blkshp> Pfizer is effective against delta
[13:43:25] <Ungwelian> So much of the world is unvaccinated because of political reasons. A massive amount of people live in undeveloped countries.
[13:43:32] <spruit11> depends on how much evolutionary space this virus has
[13:44:03] <Ungwelian> Currently, they say that vaccines give immunity for 6 months. Maybe more.
[13:44:43] <Ungwelian> So by the time the developing countries have been vaccinated, the developed already need to go through it again.
[13:44:53] <Ungwelian> It's such a circus.
[13:45:40] <spruit11> it's all been predicted.  the virusses and weather changes
[13:45:54] <amigojapan> Ungwelian: so you get another vaccine 6 months later
[13:46:31] <Ungwelian> amigojapan, theoretically yet. However, at least in Finland nobody's getting 3rd doses yet. And there aren't even any real plans for it.
[13:46:57] <amigojapan> I see Ungwelian
[13:47:58] <Ungwelian> I remember listening to this guy from our foreign institute. He said that the pandemic politics failed on a global level.
[13:48:10] <arryana> if he had just wanted to see us, that'd have been one thing, but he wanted to use our house as a base so he could visit a number of other households
[13:48:13] <arryana> that's just... insane
[13:48:25] <arryana> my other half is asthmatic, and one in five colds sends him to the hospital
[13:49:16] <arryana> i don't want to think what covid would do to him
[13:49:23] <arryana> jeopardizing him is a hard no
[13:50:02] <amigojapan> Ungwelian: why does this vaccine only last 6 months and other vaccines last for years?
[13:50:59] * amigojapan will party like it is 1999 during the 6 months
[13:59:10] <Atque> Ungwelian: In Australia, it's possible, but would involve going to a GP after getting it from a government run health centre. Go only knows why someone would do this though.
