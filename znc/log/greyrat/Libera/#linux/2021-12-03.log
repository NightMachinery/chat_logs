[02:48:38] <Dan39> jcbjoe2021: i prefer to use fdisk/gdisk and then the filesystem's command to grow
[02:48:54] <Dan39> like delete and re-add partition with fdisk, run resize2fs on it, done?
[02:49:01] <Dan39> just make sure the starting position is the same
[02:49:54] <jcbjoe2021> Dan39: I meant grow probably or something. Let's say I have a partition that's 10gigs and I want to get some free space like 5 gigs to create a née partition how would I do that? Without erasing the original partition

[02:51:17] <Dan39> jcbjoe2021: depends on the filesystem
[02:51:39] <Dan39> jcbjoe2021: some support shrinking, in that casee you usually shrink the filesystem first, then the partition to the same size, then you can add another partition

[02:52:19] <jcbjoe2021> I know gparted does it all but im trying to stay away from it just to try something new
[02:52:29] <Dan39> shrinkin is more annoying because you have to make sure you resize the partition to the exact same size you just shrinked the filesystem to, or do what i've done before and shrink it a good bit smaller than i want first, make the partition bigger, than grow it back to the full partition size
[02:53:10] <sysRPL> BorgCuba: that was captured from my raspberry pi 3
[02:53:24] <Dan39> that's pretty much just for ext3/4 filesystem, i don't think btrfs or xfs support shrinking. actually, i think one of them may have added it very recently, you can check. but anyways, you would have to copy the data off and back on to shrink with most other filesystems
[02:53:43] <jcbjoe2021> Dan39: so its better to grow?
[02:53:44] <sysRPL> running raspbian ... and using a linux pc to record the video
[02:53:53] <Dan39> jcbjoe2021: for sure, you want to avoid shrinking

[05:04:02] <Blondie101010> I have a quite unusual case which I can't even reproduce, but would like if someone has any insight about it...  if I run: `ssh "$server" ps -ef|grep "$processName" |grep -v grep`, it locks up without doing anything but the same command works with any other process and server...  the only particularity is that the "$processName" has about 300 instances...  splitting the command at the first pipe bypasses the weird issue

[13:00:42] <jim87> Hello! For development reasons, I need to access a cluster which needs to connect back to me. I'm currently under a NAT and thus can't bind on the public IP. I thought I could use a SSH tunnel, but it's not an option here. I was thus considering a VPN approach. I don't need security for this VPN, as it's not open to the net, so a simple PSK should be sufficient. Is there a way to somehow configure the VPN server and thus allow any client connect via a simple
[13:00:42] <jim87> bash script with the given IP and PSK? Thanks :)

[15:18:51] <joo-_> hmm how would You do that ?

[15:19:42] <PaulFertser> joo-_: regarding tuning the APs, in OpenWrt you can try using DAWN or "usteer" (not yet properly documented but in active development).
[15:19:51] <djph> joo-_: with a network analyzer (e.g. wifi analyzer for android), and the AP config screens.
[15:20:03] *** Quits: _inky (~inky_@188.115.224.238) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[15:20:13] <PaulFertser> But best way is to have your client configured to roam as you see fit of course, to not depend on APs kicking you out.
[15:20:17] <djph> joo-_: basically, turn DOWN the transmit power so the APs don't bleed too far into places you don't want them to
[15:20:46] <joo-_> djph: well i need to have two access point in my apartment , so when i bring laptop from one place to the other, it should just realize that the old wifi is now very weak and switch to the close one
[15:21:00] <joo-_> djph: ah yeah that could maybe be an option
[15:21:28] <djph> joo-_: yes, that is how roaming works.  But if AP1 is too high of Tx, if it doesn't fall below your client's roaming threshold, the client isn't gonna move
[15:21:45] *** Quits: seizer (~seizer@user/seizer) (Ping timeout: 250 seconds)

[15:22:46] <djph> joo-_: not really, unfortunately (I mean, it _might_ be doable, but I've never dug that deep into the kernel)

[15:37:17] <djph> joo-_: actualy, if it's "too weak for anything" but the client stays connected to it, that tends to indicate that the AP transmit settings need to be turned down a bit (i.e. the client can hear hte AP, but the AP can't hear the client)

[17:56:53] <hongkong_john> since I started using Linux on my laptops I've always used a SWAP partition but I don't think I have ever needed to use it even once. Am I totally misinformed or is it really unnecessary to even have a swap partition for my use case? I just turn my computer off when I'm not using it - I don't see why anyone would even need to hibernate their computer.

[18:52:02] <EtherMan> I have a laptop with an emmc that I’m having a bit of an issue with. Everything works ok, if I first of all set apic=off as a boot param. Until I touch that drive. If I zero out the drive using dd, then after reboot everything is fine, I can create the part table, partitions, format and everything. Up until I install a bootloader. Then suddenly touching the drive in any way, results in kernel soft locking for very long periods. Like, just writing
[18:52:03] <EtherMan> a new partition table resulted in 9 watchdog timers triggering (25s each). Actual time elapsed: about 7mins… Now I would sort of assume that means that sector is damaged or something but I can do a full write of zeroes, or full ones and it writes either perfectly, and the bootloader written works, it’s just very VERY slow (takes more than 8h to boot Alpine). If I don’t pass apic=off, it instead hard fails with input output error when it now
[18:52:03] <EtherMan> softlocks. Any ideas wth is going on? I’ve run multiple tools that all day the drive and ram are both perfectly ok too so it doesn’t seem to be a hw failure :/

[23:20:30] <Dreamer409> I've never had much luck with the GUIs for configuring samba. I recommend editing the configuration file. But, maybe someone else has tried one more recently. The problem in the past was the GUI didn't always support the latest versions of samba. Many options weren't available to be edited.
[23:20:45] <Dreamer409> Editing the configuration file directly allows you to review all of the configuration.

[23:23:52] <Dreamer409> However, configuring for a mixed windows/linux environment can sometimes get a bit hit or miss.
[23:24:02] <u1> Dreamer409: system-config-samba worked great, till python scripting got broken
[23:24:21] <PaulFertser> pikapika: of course if your interactive UEFI menu allows to change between some legacy emulation and AHCI mode for the SATA controller it should be set to AHCI, yes.
[23:24:38] <PaulFertser> pikapika: raid controller might be using different PCI VID/PID
[23:24:48] <PaulFertser> pikapika: but you'd still see that in lspci -nn.
[23:25:20] <PaulFertser> pikapika: usually this raid controller thing means you can configure soft-raid from your UEFI menu and then Linux will pick it up.
[23:25:30] <Dreamer409> u1: And that's the rub. GUI's are great for some things, not so much others. There are a ton of items in network service configuration, and you're better off learning the configuration files.
[23:25:43] <jim> Woodrow, sorry to hear that... well, you can try other stuff to see what the program is capable of
[23:26:02] <Dreamer409> I'm not sure you're going to find better than the GNOME GUI for configuration.

[23:26:54] <Dreamer409> If you really want to give it a go, I used to use Swat, but it's overkill I think.
[23:27:00] <jim> Woodrow, I remember in one program, I was able to define boundaries beyond the default "rectangle", I could add vertexes, and then put an image outside those boundaries
[23:27:04] <Woodrow> im ashamed for them
[23:27:12] <PaulFertser> pikapika: probably your UEFI somehow disabled the PCI controller altogether because you didn't configure the softraid in it.
[23:27:28] <Dreamer409> GAdmin is another.
[23:27:28] <u1> Dreamer409: how user is supposed to share files? gnome gui?
[23:27:33] <pikapika> Its possible linux does not yet have drivers for it
[23:27:48] <u1> Dreamer409: GAdmin doesnt work out of the box
[23:27:49] <pikapika> but thats also possible
[23:27:59] <pikapika> since its a fresh laptop
[23:28:09] <PaulFertser> pikapika: possible, yes, but you'd see it in lspci in this case.
[23:28:34] <jim> oh, probably they're proud of how the program turned out... I really don't like folks using shame as a motivator to change their behavior

[23:32:43] <Dreamer409> I've only used Samba in a home environment with share level security, but I believe in your case all Samba users should also have local accounts, and you would set up Samba passwords with smbpasswd
[23:33:02] <Dreamer409> As root: smbpasswd -a <username>
[23:33:08] <Woodrow> and why dont they allow size to change or have a save? thinking ease of use
[23:33:16] <Woodrow> there is no logic these days
[23:33:16] <phogg> samba users do not require local accounts, although you can set it up that way
[23:33:34] <Dreamer409> Then you would add the user to the list of valid users for a share

[23:33:55] <[[R]]> phogg: spooky
[23:33:59] <phogg> u1: running it as root?
[23:34:15] <Dreamer409> phogg: yeah, I've always preferred share level over user level in a mixed environment. Keep it simple. There's always that one windows box that refuses to play well.
[23:34:37] <phogg> Dreamer409: it's not what you'd call friendly. This is why I prefer NFS.
[23:34:39] <u1> phogg: same with root. linuxmint 20.2
[23:34:47] <jim> Woodrow, ease of use will come when you develop some "chops" in using the program (often, whatever program you might use doesn't work exactly as you want... if this is the case for you, find their bug tracker, and file a bug; it's possible that the way you want somethign to work could be useful to others, so you could encourage the developers to make some changes
[23:35:00] <phogg> with NFS you have to do something about UID sync, but otherwise it's a breeze

[23:36:18] <phogg> u1: it stands for Network File System. It's the original... network filesystem for Unix-like systems. Samba implements SMB/CIFS, which come from the Windows world. The semantics are not Unix-native, which can be a pain.
