[01:23:28] <Joanna> People believe they are correct on all sorts of issues. Culture is when people all agree upon what is good or bad. Culture is what binds large numbers of otherwise hostile people together. Censorship by omission is a fairly common tactic to prevent gullible foolish people from going astray. If they don’t know about things they won’t do them. This technique is far preferable to tempting people to do illegal things then punishing 
[01:23:28] <Joanna> them.
[01:27:40] <Joanna> Freedom of the press is just a pretext for divide and conquer tactics to split up the population into groups that hate eachother. There has never been free speech anywhere at any time with the exception of subordinates, friends and nobody being around to hear you. Other than those exceptions there have always been consequences for saying the wrong things to the wrong people.

[01:29:20] <CalimeroTeknik> so, since natural gas is not guaranteed, perhaps everyone should build a rocket stove
[01:29:35] <CalimeroTeknik> or at least look into it
[01:29:49] <Joanna> Natural gas isn’t guaranteed?
[01:30:17] <Joanna> What is a rocket stove?
[01:30:24] <CalimeroTeknik> I mean, we might get less availability 
[01:30:52] <Joanna> That would be very inconvenient if that happens
[01:31:20] <Joanna> Is your country boycotting russian gas?
[01:32:01] <CalimeroTeknik> not really, but it wouldn't hurt either, and electric stoves aren't efficient
[01:32:37] <CalimeroTeknik> the stove itself is, but electricity production and transport isn't
[01:32:39] <Joanna> I would like to have a solar stove if I could.
[01:33:06] <CalimeroTeknik> that's a good one too, though around our latitudes a backup plan won't hurt
[01:33:47] <Joanna> A solar stove won’t work all the time of course but it would reduce energy usage a lot
[01:34:35] <Joanna> I forgot what part of world you are in
[01:34:35] <CalimeroTeknik> and in turn, a proper wood burner optimises the cases when you can't use solar power

[01:35:36] <Joanna> How about an electric stove connected to a small wind turbine outside your house.
[01:36:04] <Joanna> A one burner electric stove
[01:36:43] <Joanna> If it is a windy day powering that should be possible
[01:38:03] <CalimeroTeknik> sure

[01:40:38] <CalimeroTeknik> if you want security, you epand from the dependable source to the less dependable but preferrable ones
[01:40:50] <Joanna> As far as I can tell people have designed things to waste as much energy as possible. There are windowless  public restrooms that use electricity even for flushing toilets and turning on water in sinks.
[01:42:00] *** Joins: elkclone (~elkclone@user/elkclone)
[01:42:02] <Joanna> It’s hard to believe that people survived for thousands of years without electricity isn’t it ?
[01:42:44] <CalimeroTeknik> not really
[01:43:24] <Joanna> Eating pickles and smoked and dried food
[01:43:25] <CalimeroTeknik> and it's not like we're going to forget about it overnight and stop using it
[01:44:22] <Joanna> It could go away and never come back overnight if there is emp wave from sun.
[01:44:34] <CalimeroTeknik> I sometimes get the snarky "do you want to return to the Middle Ages?" to which the correct answer is: "you know, we cannot reverse knowledge"
[01:45:18] <CalimeroTeknik> we as humans still have enough knowledge to build electric devices whatever happens
[01:45:52] <CalimeroTeknik> unless we're not here any more to begin with, but that will require no planning, so I'm ignoring that scenario
[01:45:54] <Joanna> Back before electricity people lived closer to their food supply. So meat was eaten the same day as the animal was killed
[01:48:55] <CalimeroTeknik> some was kept with salt and smoking
[01:49:22] <CalimeroTeknik> but my first reaction was "how did this go from food supply to meat?"
[01:54:52] <Joanna> Meat spoils faster than many other types of food
[01:55:55] <Joanna> People used to use streams near farms to keep milk cool before they could sell it.
[01:57:32] <Joanna> I don’t think most people even think about the topic we are discussing,they just take cheap reliable energy for granted.
[02:08:46] <CalimeroTeknik> for rocket stoves, it turns out maybe (as usual) over here in France we have the most experiments https://invidious.snopyta.org/watch?v=ltxlY5X3hRk
[02:10:27] <CalimeroTeknik> look at the plans in description, they show how it's made internally
[02:12:06] <CalimeroTeknik> it's a bit technical, with the feeder, double combustion vortex, top cooking plate, external mass for heating the house and so on

[03:17:28] <CalimeroTeknik> Joanna, it doesn't burn the entire piece of wood because the air is being drawn in
[03:17:53] <CalimeroTeknik> fire cannot progress against the wind
[03:18:48] <CalimeroTeknik> and if it did, then the tip would turn to ash, making the woodpiece fall: it's a pretty good design
[03:20:25] <Joanna> Yea not having to put wood on fire and not wasting wood all at once must be great
[03:21:06] <Joanna> So it’s fuel efficient
[03:21:24] <CalimeroTeknik> not to mention, complete combustion leaves no char or soot
[03:21:46] <CalimeroTeknik> I'm using the extra calories myself for a different purpose: instead of heating the room, since it's for outdoor use, I pre-heat the intake air https://oremilac.tk/vrac/rocketstove-arrows.jpg
[03:23:11] <CalimeroTeknik> and, the guy in the video says he would like to have an air intake from the outside for the stove, which my design has, as part of the chimney to grab calories along the pipe
[03:26:11] <CalimeroTeknik> I need to adjust the primary and secondary air supply ratio with adjustable vents, but other than that, my bunsen burner design is funny and shouldn't be too shabby
[03:27:35] <CalimeroTeknik> the problem is that the ideal primary/secondary air ratio depends on the wood used https://stoves.bioenergylists.org/rocketair
[03:28:46] <CalimeroTeknik> if that could be made to autoadjust it would be amazing
[03:34:06] <Joanna> http://kulkulfarmbali.com/how-to-build-a-rocket-stove-for-earth-friendly-cooking/
[03:39:14] <Joanna> Interesting stuff
[03:45:14] <CalimeroTeknik> they're missing the insulation, of which the most economical form is ash
[03:45:42] <CalimeroTeknik> the L should have insulation to heat up for better combustion
[03:47:29] <CalimeroTeknik> a very thin tube around the vertical one, with ash between the two, would do the job
[03:51:26] <Joanna> https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/4MRHVrPS/1647303682.JPG
[03:51:49] <Joanna> That didn’t look good
[03:52:47] <Joanna> Here are more pictures https://www.pinterest.com/pin/554294666620173163/?mt=login
[03:54:16] <Joanna> One thing that is unclear is where the ash is collected
[03:54:45] <Joanna> Also are the tips of wood elevated on a grate
[03:54:53] <Joanna> Above the ashes
[04:00:27] <CalimeroTeknik> oh, the ash is collected right where you put the wood
[04:01:50] <CalimeroTeknik> you'll find a tons of such stoves, but I showed one of the best designs
[04:02:11] <CalimeroTeknik> and i'm attempting to further improve on it, reading about all the science
[04:05:22] <Joanna> How is ash collected? I once lived somewhere with a fireplace and it had a trapdoor that went to place outside
[04:08:40] <Joanna> Maybe the best thing to do is make miniature stoves to test how well they work
[04:23:21] <CalimeroTeknik> it's what I'm doing, and it's important to get it right for the ratio of air on the wood and after the wood, and the turbulence
[04:23:49] <CalimeroTeknik> from a campfire with 10% efficiency, to a good stove with 80% efficiency for the same amount of wood, you can see why there's tuning involved
[04:24:10] <CalimeroTeknik> even a chimney has 10~20% efficiency
[04:24:57] <CalimeroTeknik> it's chemistry, thermodynamics and fluid mechanics
[04:26:33] <CalimeroTeknik> at least I finally figured out the primary/secondary air ratios thing: I just need to control the primary air (that lits the wood) and that'll take care of rushing more air to burn the smoke (which contains methane, CO, and other combustibles)
[04:27:02] <CalimeroTeknik> perhaps it should obstruct the secondary for the starting position
[04:28:40] <Joanna> Can’t you make the air intake adjustable?
[04:29:52] <Joanna> I’ve seen vents on barbecues that could open and close for different conditions

[12:58:29] <CalimeroTeknik> Joanna, in that case, to reduce flow I would limit the exhaust (why not: it increases air pressure inside the entire apparatus)
[12:59:50] <CalimeroTeknik> if there are leaks, it means they won't cool anything down by bringing air in, but you will detect them due to smoke/smell getting out
[13:02:25] <CalimeroTeknik> the thing I need to adjust is rather the ratio between the quantity of air brought on the wood and after, though this may sound a bit strange, when you start making a stove "not just a pile of wood", the part with the wood is a gasifier (some people ran cars with that), and more air is brought after that on the smoke to make that smoke burn

[17:03:38] *** Joins: BiggieSmalls_ (~BiggieSma@user/biggiesmalls)
[17:04:05] <CalimeroTeknik> typically you get just as much in total as the same weight in twigs, only with less throughput and over a longer period
[17:04:49] <CalimeroTeknik> and high temperature combusion might not be a perfect match with that
[17:05:33] <CalimeroTeknik> in theory you can stretch everything far, but in practice it requires more engineering to do so
[17:06:39] <CalimeroTeknik> so as a compromise, people would rather build something not too high-tech so they can get away with just a bit of trial and error, and call it a day with smaller bits of wood as the adequate fuel

[18:55:29] <CalimeroTeknik> of course it's easier to burn twigs faster, but you can, with a burner tuned to do so, burn them as slow as a log
