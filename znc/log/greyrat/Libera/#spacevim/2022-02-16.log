[01:52:25] <SpaceVimBot_> <csmcrvrs> Hello, has anyone been able to get VimWiki to work with SpaceVim?
[01:52:26] <SpaceVimBot_> <csmcrvrs> 
[01:52:27] <SpaceVimBot_> <csmcrvrs> I tried:
[01:52:28] <SpaceVimBot_> <csmcrvrs> [[custom_plugins]]
[01:52:30] <SpaceVimBot_> <csmcrvrs> name = "vimwiki/vimwiki"
[01:52:31] <SpaceVimBot_> <csmcrvrs> 
[01:52:32] <SpaceVimBot_> <csmcrvrs> in the init.toml.  It seemed like the plugin was loaded without error but /ww is not recognized.
[01:58:57] <SpaceVimBot_> <csmcrvrs> > ubuntu21.10
[01:58:57] <SpaceVimBot_> <csmcrvrs> > i tried using node from apt but it is not working for me
[01:58:58] <SpaceVimBot_> <csmcrvrs> > i got error on node because restricted global install
[01:59:00] <SpaceVimBot_> <csmcrvrs> > similar issue

[01:59:02] <SpaceVimBot_> <csmcrvrs> > so uninstall node from apt and install nvm with  their guide here

[01:59:06] <SpaceVimBot_> <csmcrvrs> @rachmadaniHaryono So are you able to generate the html expression of your markdown file when you do:  SPC l p    ?
[02:20:46] <SpaceVimBot_> <csmcrvrs> Hmm, seems to be working now.  I think I was hitting the wrong slash for my leader key.

[03:51:42] <SpaceVimBot_> <rachmadaniHaryono> yes but there must be pause between `l` and `p`
[07:06:11] <SpaceVimBot_> <CsmcRvrs> Yeah, I noticed that too.  odd.
