[02:18:29] <Cl0udNinja> PattyCakes, If my dog wasnt so dumb he could probably do the same, but last time we were out on ranch land he immediately tried to fuck with a horse
[02:19:25] <PattyCakes> that's always the worry Cl0udNinja 
[02:19:31] <PattyCakes> I had the same concern when we got there
[02:19:57] <PattyCakes> but I also have this weird thing in my brain that is able to separate "love this dog to death" and "I can't fix or love stupid"

[02:19:58] <layer8> Cl0udNinja meant: "PattyCakes, If my dog wasnt so dumb he could probably do the same, but last time we were out on ranch land he immediately tried to fuck horse"
[02:20:09] <PattyCakes> Like, either you're going to learn that cows kick hard
[02:20:13] <PattyCakes> or you're gonna be dead in the field
[02:20:22] <PattyCakes> Choose wisely
[02:20:51] <PrincessZoey> "As your server blah.net is presenting too great a threat to our network,
[02:20:51] <PrincessZoey> we had no choice but to place it in 'rescue FTP' mode. An email 
[02:20:51] <PrincessZoey> containing a username and password has been sent to you so that so you can 
[02:20:51] <PrincessZoey> easily retrieve any data still located in the storage space.
[02:21:31] <PattyCakes> In general, animals are pretty good about not getting themselves killed
[02:21:50] <PattyCakes> don't get my wrong, my dog will engulf an entire onion and garlic clove (which are toxic) if you let her
[02:22:00] <PattyCakes> but she ain't gonna get domed by a moo
[02:22:15] <Cl0udNinja> PrincessZoey, that sounds more like they thought your server was being attacked so they shut it down, probably doing something wild
[02:22:40] <PattyCakes> My real concern was her getting too far and getting lost, or hit by a car
[02:22:54] <PattyCakes> I got her a GPS collar, she went no more than a mile radius and never crossed a road
[02:22:55] <Cl0udNinja> he almost got a hoof to the head.. if I hadnt yanked him away he would've, the horse was winding up for a kick and dumbshit dog was still tryin to get him
[02:23:08] <PattyCakes> she did say hi to the neighbors dog, 3 properties away
[02:23:21] <PattyCakes> but that GPS collar really put me at ease
[02:23:56] <PrincessZoey> lmfao and the ftp access they gave me doesn't actually have any files
[02:24:13] <PattyCakes> like I said Cl0udNinja, my philosophy is to let him learn the lesson. Now if he does it twice (and lives), then fine

[02:24:17] <PattyCakes> :P
[02:24:54] <Cl0udNinja> lol
[02:24:58] <PattyCakes> oh, and I'm also talking about dogs with bloodlines of working dogs
[02:24:59] <PrincessZoey> I only have like 4 ports open, so I have no idea. (SSH/ HTTP/HTTPS and my VPN)
[02:25:03] <Cl0udNinja> hes smart in someways, but hes stupid in others
[02:25:05] <PattyCakes> your retrievers, cattle dogs, etc
[02:25:12] <PattyCakes> don't put a tea cup poodle in a cow pasture
[02:25:17] <PattyCakes> that's more stupid owner vs stupid dog
[02:25:25] <Cl0udNinja> its a staffy :P
[02:25:36] <PattyCakes> oh yea, he's plenty big enough to learn at least once
[02:26:00] <PattyCakes> but I get it, I'm the crazy person here
[02:26:33] <PattyCakes> just grew up this way. Treat my dogs like kings and queens, but in return we expect a good well behaved dog
[02:27:16] <PattyCakes> I don't judge training or parenting. None of my fucking business. If you want your little rat dog to bark it's little head off 24x7 - more power to you
[02:27:20] <PattyCakes> I just hope you burn in hell
[02:27:31] <Cl0udNinja> lol
[02:28:09] <PattyCakes> and it ain't easy. Like I said, I'm at 2 years on this one and I kinda cheated
[02:28:13] <PattyCakes> she went to training school for a month
[02:28:33] <Cl0udNinja> hes pretty well behaved, he tries to pull a lot and throw his weight around, but other than that, he listens well 90% of the time
[02:28:36] <PattyCakes> they specifically worked her around larger animals (goats and chickens irrc)
[02:29:14] <PattyCakes> I get a kick out of the karens that use training schools, and then get all pissy when their $5000 trainned dog isn't trained anymore in 6 weeks
[02:29:31] <PattyCakes> The quality of stupid is absurd
[02:30:41] <PattyCakes> Like stupid person, it takes 18 years before your nasty spermgobblin is trained, and even then there's a good chance it'll fuck up and piss in the closet
[02:31:04] <PattyCakes> you want a perfectly trained animal after 30 days, with 0 additional work?
[02:32:41] <Cl0udNinja> shit I had to git gud at life at the age of 8
[02:33:01] <PattyCakes> The place I had her at almost always requires 4-6 weeks of PRE-Training (group classes) before they'll take a dog on for a full month train and board. I actually was able to convince them to waive that for me seeing how I was in a wheelchair at the time
[02:33:19] <PattyCakes> they were very hesitant, didn't wanna take her, said it wouldn't work - that's not how training works. The humans require more training than the dogs
[02:33:22] <PattyCakes> blah blah blah
[02:34:10] <PattyCakes> "I will literally pay you more, and sign a document that says your only legal requirement is to board her for the month. Please I beg of you" lol
[02:35:40] <PattyCakes> Just needed her gone for a month to relearn how to use the ankle I broke - but really wanted to kill 2 birds with 1 stone. Training and Boarding
[02:36:38] <PattyCakes> ok yea, I sound like the kind of parent I hate that has nothing better to talk about than the spelling bee their spermgobblin won
[02:36:43] <PattyCakes> at least my dog is cute :D
[02:37:25] <PattyCakes> and to end my Ted Talk. Dogs are not children. Do not call your dog your child. You are not a doggy parent. GTFO
[02:38:02] <PattyCakes> If my kid broke my ankle, his ass would be at a fire station with a sign around his neck 
[02:38:20] <PattyCakes> I kept the dog that broke it though :D

[08:13:29] <sideup66> ok am i the only one around here who feels awkward about home networking
[08:14:17] <sideup66> ie gigabit is kinda coming to the end of its useful life because well, home plans are at gigabit and some whispers of multi gig are already happening...meanwhile lan ports on most consumer stuff is still gigabit....you can GET some with 10 gig or multi...but its stupid $$$$ and or half enterprise stuff
[08:14:42] <sd> 10<n​emisys> I still have some 100mbps stuff
[08:14:57] <sideup66> and feel like awkward stepchild because if i upgrade...i feel like new stuff isnt really future proofed? ie you should be seeing home routers now with multi gig across the switch, maybe 2.5 or 5
[08:14:57] <sd> 10<n​emisys> Linksys WRT54G + dd-wrt ftw
[08:15:19] <sideup66> this way...you get faster wifi router...future proof that and lan is future proofed
[08:15:22] <sd> 10<n​emisys> are you really gonna notice the difference?
[08:15:27] <sideup66> as your endpoints get better, the backend can just deal with it
[08:15:40] <sideup66> if you run multi gig stuff, and have say a NAS on it...youll notice it
[08:15:48] <monr0e> The laptop I use as my generic webserver is a 100mbps machine. Its an elderly Inspiron, but it works just fine. No difference having a 40mb connection vs having a gigabit connection over here
[08:16:27] <monr0e> I did upgrade to 80 down though because I couldn't get 40/30. 80/30 serves e well enoguh
[08:17:04] <sideup66> yeah but in my setup its about 400 down atm
[08:17:25] <sideup66> but with higher speeds coming and they keep pushing up, i am not saying you NEED it, but as a futureproof moreso
[08:18:13] <monr0e> The only thing I really notice is the Raspberry pi that serves as a media centre. That has a supposedly gigabit nic, but in reality it doesn't have the processing or storage speed for anything mroe than 150mpbs or so. Copying bluray films to it is a bit of a pain. When I get a proper nas though, that won't be an issue
[08:18:43] <sd> 10<n​emisys> I think the NIC in the pi runs off the USB bus, which might be your bottleneck
[08:19:02] <monr0e> It probably does. The SD card is also going to have na impact
[08:19:48] <sideup66> granted i dont buy a pi to go fast
[08:19:52] <sideup66> mine is in a hobby project really

[08:21:37] <monr0e> I did try setting up a mailserver on it, but it was so finicky and I couldn't get an imap client to work
[08:22:21] <sd> 10<n​emisys> yeah linux imap servers are a pain in the butt, especially trying to get SSL working

[08:26:21] <sideup66> ahh see consumer isps in the US register their client ips with spamhaus
[08:26:32] <sideup66> so youd be flagged as spam everywhere if you ran your own server, no?
[08:26:42] <monr0e> idk, I'm not in the US

[13:38:11] <lancehead> cl0udNinja; birds *aren't* real 
[13:38:13] <Cl0udNinja> actually if you wanna talk conspiracy shit. I think I found one this weekend
[13:38:33] <Cl0udNinja> so.. everywhere in america, the gas prices are 4.XX and 9/10ths of a cent
[13:38:42] <Cl0udNinja> right ok I get the 9/10ths, but..
[13:39:10] <Cl0udNinja> WHERE DOES THE OTHER 1/10th go!?? the machines automatically round it, obviously upward, so we never see it
[13:39:27] <Cl0udNinja> gas stations around the world been pulling an office space/superman on us for years
[13:40:12] <monr0e> I remember reading something about this, and it being permissible to round up only if it was at 6/10 or above
[13:40:18] <monr0e> I could be wrong on that
[13:40:27] <monr0e> Banks do the same thing with currency exchange though
[13:40:55] <Cl0udNinja> right thats how the whole office space thing started, was because they were shaving it off and nobody cared until they started taking it and doing something with it
[13:42:01] <Cl0udNinja> but how do we know thats not really whats happening there? like, you get 8 gallons of gas, so you've paid 8/10ths of a penny at the end, they round it up, so we pay for it, but its money we pay for nothing
[13:42:31] <Cl0udNinja> pay for it/pay a whole penny
[13:42:54] <monr0e> Not a damn clue. Also not that consequential for the individual tbh, even if it does result in an extra few thousand a week
[13:43:46] <Cl0udNinja> idk man... when I was driving to work every day, I was filing up a full tank 3 times a week, thats 60+ gallons of 1/10th of a penny
[13:44:46] <Cl0udNinja> also on the topic of gas stations, if any gas station charges more for using a CC, the fees are way steeper than they seem if you add it up on a full tank. like, if they charge 10cents/gallon for using card over cash, by the end of a tank thats more than $2 for using your card.. goddamn thievery
[13:45:29] <monr0e> Here in the UK we have debit cards with the same protections as US credit cards, and we don't get charged a fee for them. Its actually illegal to charge a convenience fee now
[13:51:50] <Kiernian|Work> doesn't it just average out to an extra half cent a gallon, though?

[14:02:31] <Kiernian|Work> eventually the tenths of a cent gets to zero and you pay even. the rest of the time, below five tenths the price is rounded down (net loss for the retailer) and at or above 5 tenths it's rounded up (net gain for the retailer, which covers for the loss of rounding down)

[14:38:35] <Kiernian|Work> my main problem with azure...or any cloud solution really, is the absolutely obtuse pricing and how very, very easy it is for things to get out of hand there. Keeping up with and tweaking usage/billing could easily be a full time job and then some
[14:39:00] <Kiernian|Work> unless you're big enough to simply not care about 20 grand one way or the other in any given month

[14:49:41] <monr0e> I have more concerns about the lack of control over infrastructure, and what that means for the smaller businesses in respect of uptime. Even with failover, its concerning. If I run my own equipment, I at least have the ability to pick it up and move it in a worst case scenario.
[14:57:18] <Kiernian|Work> yup, and there are still some severe failings with regards to cloud infrastructure. Time to propigate changes is a huge one.
[14:57:48] <Kiernian|Work> It also takes me several orders of magnitude longer to do message searches in cloud 365 compared to on prem exchange
[14:58:27] <Kiernian|Work> less than an hours worth of work on prem for a few dozen or so searches is now several DAYS
[14:59:09] <monr0e> Not to mention what happens if local connectivity is lost. A work stoppage that could be prevented by having on-prem equipment is a stick in the heel for me
[15:00:06] <Kiernian|Work> yeah. https://imgur.com/a/Yqva7
[15:07:24] <teh_f4ll3n> My issue with anything cloud-base is the speed
[15:08:13] <teh_f4ll3n> especially SMB when you have 65k files per directory and need to manipulate those
[15:08:26] <teh_f4ll3n> holy shit it takes so long sometimes
[15:09:09] <teh_f4ll3n> 1 is fine, but when your app needs to rename/move 40-50 at a time...
[15:09:10] <Kiernian|Work> yeah, who would have thought that putting MORE hops between everything would make it take lo...n..g..oh wait. we all did.
[15:09:54] <teh_f4ll3n> LAN takes 2 seconds. Azure - sometimes reaches the application timeout limits of 300s
[15:09:59] <Kiernian|Work> yup
[15:10:14] <riff-IRC> on-prem FS > * for massive large-scale file management
[15:10:39] <teh_f4ll3n> that's what I've been saying all along
[15:10:54] <riff-IRC> anything else is chancing disaster
[15:11:06] <riff-IRC> and even on-prem can be easily setup for failure
[15:11:20] <teh_f4ll3n> I even advise customers against migrating to cloud if they have a lot of data
[15:11:21] <riff-IRC> say, RAID 0 on a 96TB diskk array
[15:11:30] <teh_f4ll3n> data = media in our case
[15:11:32] <Kiernian|Work> yeah. how many times have we seen news stories about "soandso corp lost 12 TB of data"
[15:11:42] <Kiernian|Work> and it's almost always during a migration
[15:11:57] <teh_f4ll3n> RAID 0 is not meant for permanent storage
[15:11:58] <monr0e> The only use for the cloud is as a live backup medium. 
[15:12:06] <teh_f4ll3n> RAID0 is for caching
[15:12:14] <monr0e> But if you dont have a backup medium, you're an idiot
[15:12:41] <CptLuxx> raid 0 best backup
[15:12:41] <riff-IRC> had a generator control system lose it's primary ATA channel in 1995 or so- it had 4 drives in a RAID 0, and the ATA controller overwrote the 2nd disk with trash on its way out
[15:13:39] <riff-IRC> we got the data back, but it wasn't a good situation.
[15:14:30] <teh_f4ll3n> CptLuxx, pfsense best firewall?
[15:14:37] <riff-IRC> OPNsnese
[15:14:41] <riff-IRC> *OPNsense
[15:15:22] <riff-IRC> $20,000 was the bill on that- but the data that was recovered was enough to prove that a recent (and catastrophic) generator engine failure was the cause of a fire that destroyed an electronics lab
[15:15:51] <monr0e> No power smoothing? No voltage capping? 
[15:16:07] <monr0e> I mean, it was 1995, but still
[15:16:40] <riff-IRC> metallurgy analysis determined that a casting error (sharp edge on the inside surface of the upper crankcase) resulted in premature block failure
[15:17:26] <riff-IRC> when it failed, the carnage ripped everything in the upper crankcase apart before spreading to the lower crankcase
[15:17:53] <riff-IRC> cue a piston getting ejected right into some 4160V ducting
[15:18:09] <monr0e> jesus christ
[15:19:23] <riff-IRC> that dislodged enough shop dust that when the 4160V flashed over, it created an explosive fireball that blew through some improperly fireproofed conduit, which exposed a few chafing points in some 600V wiring, creating more major arcing
[15:20:45] <riff-IRC> that eventually hard shorted, but the previous explosion had damaged switchgear, resulting in the trip coil on the 600V main breaker failing to fire off, so the power stayed on
[15:21:55] <riff-IRC> so now you have three-phase 600V melting down, which leaked out of the lab side of the conduit and onto an exposed stack of paper, setting it alight
[15:22:54] <riff-IRC> and that's when the CCTV system went offline- the UPS protecting it shut down on an overheat condition
[15:24:20] <riff-IRC> the UPS protecting the generator control system held up until its batteries were depleted, but the heat was enough to trigger the failure of the primary ATA controller, resulting in it trashing the 2nd disk
[15:25:03] <monr0e> I think at that point I'd have quit. That's one hell of a chain of events
[15:25:14] <riff-IRC> Seen worse.
[15:26:56] <riff-IRC> January 4, 1988. A cold day. It's 2:30am when a coworker signs off, clocks out, and takes a nap in a random part of the generator room. (Heater in the main office had failed the day prior, but the generator room heater was still running.)
[15:27:08] <riff-IRC> 3am, we all sign off and head home.
[15:27:39] <riff-IRC> 3:30am, power failure. Generator notices am imbalance and performs a slow spinup before coming online.
[15:28:29] <riff-IRC> 4:30am, phone rings. Double power failure, aka utility power offline and generator is locked out. "SUSTAINED MODERATE IMBALANCE" is the reported fault.
[15:29:16] <riff-IRC> 5am, I manually bring it online again. Red spray EVERYWHERE. Slammed the EPO switch and shut 'er down.
[15:30:54] <monr0e> wait 
[15:30:56] <monr0e> hol up
[15:31:30] <monr0e> dude got caught up in the genset?
[15:39:29] <Kiernian|Work> don't sleep on stuff with moving parts. holy crap.
[15:40:22] <riff-IRC> Yep.
[15:40:48] <monr0e> Did he... did he live?
[15:41:57] <riff-IRC> No. Dead as soon as it started up. Idle speed is 750RPM on it, and nominal operating speed is 1800RPM. Load sensing had it up at 2100RPM before the main load relays closed, at which point the surge load brought it down to 1800RPM.
[15:42:16] <monr0e> what a way to go
[15:43:46] <riff-IRC> There's a reason why the security system tapes for 01/04/88 don't exist.
[15:44:21] <riff-IRC> They got tossed into the generator at full operating speed in June 1988 when we re-opened for business.

[20:07:13] <PublicWifi> I have a z80 breadboard computer i've been working on and off for like 5 years lol

[20:08:08] <sd> 14<K​illnine> When I took a job in software dev I was more on the elctrician side so got to design some data collection panels that used optoisolators and such to wire up PLCs. It was more legos and less actual circuit design but still very fun
[20:08:50] <sd> 14<K​illnine> Then moved my way up to software dev/engineering side and got more away from the hardware. Then, after 13 years was like "you know what? I'l throw all this in the garbage and start an IT dept from scratch". And here we are

[20:33:19] <signofzeta> it's getting weaker, but it's spreading more easily.  our hospitals are still overwhelmed, even in my U.S. state with one of the highest voluntary vaccination rates.  but, it's getting better.
[20:34:16] <zetorian> I can't say I'm exactly hopeful yet. there's no garuntee that the next variant will be weaker and hospitals are effectively broken.
[20:34:41] <zetorian> the hospitals in my state are at 130% capacity. most rooms are double beds at this point, and they are absolutely hemoraging nurses.
[20:34:53] <zetorian> it's to the point they are paying med students to do nursing jobs.

[20:41:09] <signofzeta> COVID-19 will definitely become endemic. but enough people get vaccinated, and the virus continues mutating to get less severe, it won't matter if the future mutations get more spreadable.  the modern H1N1 flu is the old "Spanish" flu.

[20:51:39] <PublicWifi> so you can turn that shit into swoleness and then when you lean out youll be a grecian god
[20:52:20] <PublicWifi> as far as daily life goes, youll feel the biggest difference after you do cradio and leg days for a while
[20:52:28] <mistiry> im not really a fat ass, just got some dad bod going on
[20:52:55] <mistiry> im like 215. got some covid weight.
[20:53:00] <signofzeta> good, I'm getting past dad bod.  doesn't help that I'm not a dad yet.
[20:53:13] <misspwn> dad bods are in
[20:53:27] <mistiry> i should be ~180
[20:53:33] <mistiry> so im over for sure
[20:53:51] <PattyCakes> At least ya'll aren't in the same odd position as PattyCakes - Imagine being a fat ass AND working for a health and fitness company
[20:53:54] <mistiry> but its not like i cant see my feet. i dont even got a flap-over-the-belt LOL
[20:53:56] <PattyCakes> boy, some of those video calls are awkward
[20:53:58] <PublicWifi> PattyCakes: LOL
[20:54:08] <PublicWifi> PattyCakes: hey man get on the gym train with us
[20:54:15] <PattyCakes> man, I ain't even fuckin joking either lol
[20:54:17] <PublicWifi> I'm trying to see all my buddies get healthy
[20:54:23] <PublicWifi> its never too late
[20:54:36] <PattyCakes> oh, I'm working on it. Gym isn't my cup of tea no matter what my resume says
[20:54:43] <mistiry> i was surprisingly more flexiible than i thought when i started back up
[20:54:43] <PublicWifi> and if you are truly a "fat ass" then you have the gift of massive calves and you can keep them while you lose weight and train
[20:54:55] <PublicWifi> fat dude calves are dope as fuck and I envy them lol
[20:55:02] <PattyCakes> PublicWifi 306lbs
[20:55:07] <PattyCakes> I can left a horse with my legs
[20:55:10] <PublicWifi> bro I bet your calves are shredded
[20:55:23] <PattyCakes> s/left/lift
[20:55:24] <layer8> PattyCakes meant: "I can lift a horse with my legs"
[20:55:29] <PublicWifi> bro you can keep most of that strength too if you keep lifting heavy while cutting
[20:55:33] <PublicWifi> dude youll be a force of nature lol
[20:55:55] <PattyCakes> bro. Either you are a gym rat and just love weights - or you are ignorantly giving terrible information
[20:56:07] <PublicWifi> i go to the gym a lot xD
[20:56:08] <PattyCakes> I'm ok with the gym rat, as long as you know what you are recommending is not the proper way
[20:56:23] <PublicWifi> I've seen lots of big dudes cut and look jacked lol
[20:56:26] <zetorian> whatever the case, i'm here for the positivity.
[20:56:31] <PublicWifi> POSITIVITY
[20:56:34] <PattyCakes> LOVE IT
[20:56:46] <vinrock> i should do roids
[20:56:50] <vinrock> that would be rad
[20:56:52] <vinrock> become a beast at 42
[20:56:56] <vinrock> just not give a shit
[20:56:59] <vinrock> heart explodes
[20:57:02] <PattyCakes> but as a fat dude, tell me to hit the gym and get swole (while possible) won't help the shitty diet, the depressions, etc
[20:57:08] <PublicWifi> its true :S
[20:57:16] <PattyCakes> fix your brain, mind, and soul first. Then get swole
[20:57:24] <mistiry> it was easier for me to start by finding a friend to go with
[20:57:32] <PattyCakes> bring, diet, and soul*
[20:57:34] <vinrock> poor dietary health fucks up your brain like a person that abuses drugs
[20:57:38] <vinrock> your chemicals are all outa whack
[20:57:38] <PattyCakes> ^
[20:57:49] <mistiry> thats why you inject more chemicals
[20:57:51] <mistiry> to balance it out
[20:57:53] <vinrock> word up
[20:57:56] <PattyCakes> the red ones bring me up
[20:57:57] <zetorian> I will tell you nothing has helped my mental health more than learning how to cook decent food.
[20:57:59] <PattyCakes> the blue ones bring me down
[20:58:07] <PublicWifi> i read a study the other day that said daily exercise was -ALMOST- as effective as depression meds in MOST people in the study
[20:58:09] <zetorian> lol
[20:58:14] <PublicWifi> shit makes your brain happy
[20:58:17] <PattyCakes> zetorian, I am deep in the middle of redoing my entire kitchen layout
[20:58:30] <PattyCakes> I've found I love cooking, but it's aggrivating when you can't do it effeciantly
[20:58:40] <mistiry> working out releases endorphins
[20:58:59] <vinrock> i cant wait to get a plac with an island in the kitchen and a bigass cooktop
[20:59:02] <mistiry> i love to cook. always said if i didnt go IT i would have went to be a chef
[20:59:04] <vinrock> so i can whip up cheesesteaks like a boss
[20:59:18] <mistiry> why am i opped
[20:59:33] <PattyCakes> vinrock, man I gotta show you my spice rack. That alone made cooking more fun
[20:59:34] <zetorian> PattyCakes:  thats totally fair. i'd suggest getting yourself a nice big skillet. they work great and you can cook all kinds of shit.
[20:59:41] *** ChanServ sets mode: -o mistiry
[20:59:54] <vinrock> i seriously learned how to enjoy cooking from watching the original iron chef
[21:00:08] <mistiry> ive been watching Adam Ragusea lately
[21:00:11] <vinrock> i had to learn how to get all my shit prepped beforehand, get the water boilding and oven preheated first, etc

[21:00:36] <vinrock> i watch a lot of yt cooking shows
[21:01:09] <vinrock> oh yeah sweet spice rack
[21:01:53] <PattyCakes> that made cooking a lot easier, well not easier, but I mean come on. I'm in IT
[21:01:58] <PattyCakes> if it's not efficient or quick
[21:02:01] <PattyCakes> I don;t do it

[21:06:05] <A-KO> the best part is, they opened a Sev A Microsoft ticket before calling me
[21:06:06] <PattyCakes> first is a learning experience, second is a stupid experience, third it's time to find a new job
[21:06:06] <A-KO> lol

[21:06:19] <mistiry> it happens. but as long as they learn from their failures, it's not a bad thing to be able to hand off to others. if you're the only one that can do something, good luck taking a vacation.
[21:06:20] <A-KO> so they called me
[21:06:20] <shakygator> this stock market, is the world ending
[21:06:26] <PattyCakes> I have done more stupid, than I have learning
[21:06:41] <A-KO> mistiry: I don't mind handing things off to others, but a lot of the folks on the team are very green.
[21:06:49] <PattyCakes> I make the first mistake cause I didn't know better, I make the second mistake because I thought I knew better

[21:07:35] <PattyCakes> @bdenlinger O_O you did WHAT now?
[21:07:46] <PattyCakes> shakygator, 4 years? Are you like at retirement age?
[21:07:52] <shakygator> no
[21:08:01] <shakygator> its just a reference for how shit the market has been this year
[21:08:03] <mistiry> A-KO: yeah that's not the most fun to deal with. as long as they are capable of learning. if not, they're just aggravating.

[21:08:46] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> Monday morning sell off after a bad Friday is normal though
[21:08:56] <shakygator> cuz no amount of technical analysis matters when the whole market corrects
[21:08:59] <PattyCakes> I didn't realize you were playing the game
[21:09:20] <PattyCakes> the game is fun, but I hate when panic sets in and people go doing stupid things with long term strategies based on short term events
[21:09:23] <shakygator> not a big amount, very small amount of the portfolio. point is i was better off having this money in a savings account if the market is this shit
[21:09:32] <PattyCakes> if you wanna play short term, have fun, I agree it's hella fun
[21:09:51] <shakygator> my system was killing it, but since september the market has not been so great
[21:10:01] <PattyCakes> but lets not start setting in actual panic, because my long portfolio will do fine without needing to resort to moving to bonds
[21:10:01] <mistiry> just invest everything in NFT's
[21:10:04] <PattyCakes> and risking taxable events
[21:10:06] <mistiry> safest bet
[21:10:10] <signofzeta> My dentist called to reschedule for the third time. I remember early in the pandemic when they all dressed like they worked in a nuclear reactor. maybe they should go back to that.
[21:10:31] <shakygator> well if it goes down any more i could move to bonds with no taxable events

[21:16:56] <Bru^> lolol
[21:16:58] <PattyCakes> I put in only what hte company matches, and then the roth gets maxed out, if I have any extra of my allocated 30% net for investments, I put that into ETFs through Fidelity
[21:17:03] <PublicWifi> their cheapest fee is still so high its like 100K+ different at the end of retirment
[21:17:03] <Bru^> LET ME TALK TO YOU ABOUT LIFE INSURANCE
[21:17:05] <PublicWifi> just insane
[21:17:24] <PattyCakes> I however don't go bonkers like some people do. I have the ability to save more, but I don't
[21:17:31] <Bru^> i put in 10%
[21:17:34] <Bru^> company puts in 3%
[21:17:35] <PattyCakes> because the world is the world, and I'm not sure we'll be here in 40 years
[21:17:55] <PattyCakes> that's a waste of money Bru^, if they match up to 3%, contribute that, put the difference in a roth
[21:18:05] <PattyCakes> it'll grow more, and at a tax free withdrawl basis
[21:18:11] <PattyCakes> grow better*
[21:18:24] <PattyCakes> because you generally get more granular control of how you can fuck it up

[21:19:07] <Bru^> PattyCakes: isnt there a 10% penalty on that?
[21:19:08] <PattyCakes> my Roth matches basically what I do on the 401k. The only benefit it gets me is all that capital gains growth is tax free at 65
[21:19:11] <PattyCakes> or whatever the age is
[21:19:11] <Bru^> early withdrawal?
[21:19:17] <PattyCakes> Yea, don't fucking touch it
[21:19:39] <Bru^> tbh i can only see taxes getting higher
[21:19:42] <Bru^> so yeah
[21:19:43] <Bru^> good thought
[21:19:47] <Bru^> I may be doing some moving around
[21:19:53] <PattyCakes> No, don't be doing any moving.
[21:19:58] <PattyCakes> Just change your contribution, and start a roth
[21:19:59] <Bru^> I mean
[21:20:00] <PattyCakes> yea
[21:20:00] <Bru^> allocations
[21:20:01] <PattyCakes> I know
[21:20:05] <Bru^> not moving $
[21:20:53] <PattyCakes> Trying to make it as easy as possible for any lurker reading that might be interested. It's generally the "goto" formula for retirement. 401ks are great only when they match. If they don't match, using a 401k is about the dumbest thing ever
[21:20:56] <Bru^> ive got a traditional IRA in schwab right now from an old rollover
[21:21:03] <Bru^> might do the ROTH for future
[21:21:04] <PattyCakes> because you get taxed on what you pull out at retirement
[21:21:24] <PattyCakes> with a roth, you put in today POST tax, get all the gains over 40 years, and withdrawl with 0 tax liability
[21:21:41] <Bru^> unless they change tax code
[21:21:42] <PattyCakes> where as 401k is pretax contributions, but taxed at withdrawl
[21:21:44] <PattyCakes> TRUE
[21:21:49] <Bru^> but yeah youre right
[21:21:53] <PattyCakes> but there's a literal fuckton of money in ROTHs
[21:21:59] <PattyCakes> I don't see the banking industry allowing that to happen
[21:22:00] <PattyCakes> quite honestly
[21:22:15] <Bru^> youd hope not
[21:24:00] <PattyCakes> My dad pulled the ultimate move and did the backdoor roth method - https://www.forbes.com/advisor/retirement/mega-backdoor-roth/
[21:24:21] <PattyCakes> went from a 401k to a TIRA, then converted that post retirement to a roth at a single 12% rate (since he's now legally unemployed with 0 income)
[21:24:44] <PublicWifi> i absolutely love hearing stories about people evading taxation
[21:24:51] <PattyCakes> I was honestly impressed
[21:25:00] <PublicWifi> i would avoid every single tax I could if i was rich

[21:25:13] <PattyCakes> he's not rich, well that's realtive to who you are talking to
[21:25:16] <PublicWifi> right
[21:25:20] <PattyCakes> he worked a white collar engineering job for 50 years
[21:25:32] <PattyCakes> and was very smart with his retirement savings
[21:25:48] <PublicWifi> avoid every tax you can lol
[21:25:55] <PattyCakes> sucks he can't use any of it for fun - seeing how he slaved away for that long and now his body won't let him enjoy all the new tools he now can afford
[21:26:02] <PublicWifi> damn that sucks
[21:26:09] <PattyCakes> learned my lesson from him
[21:26:31] <PattyCakes> balance between setting up for future success vs having fun now
[21:26:45] <Bru^> yeah
[21:26:47] <Bru^> live life
[21:26:52] <PattyCakes> I won't be eating ramen in retirement, but I sure as hell won't be flying first class around the world either
[21:27:42] <PublicWifi> ive got a few goals I want to hit first, then ill start enjoying my money lol
[21:27:46] <PublicWifi> pay off my house and stuff like that
[21:27:50] <Bru^> wow
[21:27:54] <PattyCakes> Yea, mine was 6 figures by 30
[21:28:01] <Bru^> if you make over $144k, you cant contribute to a roth directly?
[21:28:01] <PattyCakes> I hit that, and started enjoying my time
[21:28:01] <PublicWifi> yeah 6 figures is my next goal
[21:28:13] <PattyCakes> Nope Bru^, problem I have now
[21:28:18] <PattyCakes> gotta get crafty
[21:28:32] <Bru^> hmm
[21:28:43] <PattyCakes> The advise I gave is for the majority of people. If you're making over that 144k, you don't need an IRC channel
[21:28:45] <PattyCakes> you need an account
[21:28:47] <PattyCakes> you can afford one
[21:28:50] <shakygator> just get into cloud, 6 figures is ez then
[21:28:52] <PattyCakes> accountant*
[21:28:53] <shakygator> esp right now
[21:29:08] <PublicWifi> hard to get into cloud in my area
[21:29:13] <PublicWifi> and online jobs are so damn competitive
[21:29:24] <shakygator> the people applying for online jobs dont know anything
[21:29:30] <shakygator> green people asking for 200+ these days
[21:29:32] <PattyCakes> if it was that easy shakygator, I wouldn't have 5 senior DevOps openings
[21:29:33] <PattyCakes> or 3 SRE openings
[21:29:39] <PattyCakes> or 5 Cloud Architect openings
[21:29:40] <PattyCakes> lol
[21:29:42] <shakygator> thats my point, people suck
[21:29:44] <PublicWifi> i've applied to a few dozen online postings
[21:29:44] <PattyCakes> ^
[21:29:45] <shakygator> hard to find good help
[21:29:53] <PublicWifi> shit ill take 100k as a greenie, how about that
[21:29:55] <PublicWifi> xD
[21:29:56] <shakygator> so if you know youre stuff its ez
[21:29:58] <PublicWifi> cloud greenie*
[21:30:12] <shakygator> we had a guy come in with under 3 years exp, ask for 200k, and to buy off his 200k in unvested stock
[21:30:18] <PublicWifi> LOL
[21:30:30] <PattyCakes> motherfucker, it took me a decade to hit 100k. People do it faster, but those are the types that you don't wanna hire.
[21:30:37] <PublicWifi> 3 years exp cloud tech? or total career
[21:30:40] <shakygator> same, but now the market is crazy
[21:30:52] <shakygator> im not sure, i didnt interview him
[21:31:00] <PattyCakes> let the market be cray is the way I feel
[21:31:07] <PattyCakes> it's not like they're hurting my salary
[21:31:15] <shakygator> good time to jump ship
[21:31:18] <PattyCakes> but I'm 100% not anywhere near what some of the dumbasses ask for
[21:31:32] <PattyCakes> nah, again - money ain't the end all
[21:31:38] <vinrock> maybe the guy only wanted 100
[21:31:41] <vinrock> so he asked for 200
[21:31:51] <vinrock> then they cut him down and he was like, arraight
[21:32:21] <PattyCakes> we had a guy, who was honestly qualified come in asking what was semi reasonable (160k), but acted like he was the god who invented AWS
[21:32:33] <Bru^> PattyCakes: im still under that limit, but very interesting
[21:32:51] <PattyCakes> Go fuck up someone elses day for $160k/year. I don't need you in my life
[21:32:54] <Bru^> i might drop my contribution back to 6% at work (they match 50% up to 3%)
[21:33:01] <Bru^> then throw the other 4 into ROTH
[21:33:05] <PattyCakes> This is the way
[21:34:54] <shakygator> thats probably why you still have 8 open positions
[21:35:00] <shakygator> labor is short right now, esp good labor, so the market is paying
[21:35:05] <PattyCakes> oh I know
[21:35:13] <PattyCakes> don't disagree
[21:35:16] <shakygator> i wont talk to anyone for under 170 right now
[21:35:23] <shakygator> and closer to 200 is looking more realistic
[21:35:51] <sd> 14<K​illnine> Man, my employer wont enroll into 401k until 1yr of service. wtf
[21:36:07] <sd> 14<K​illnine> So I guess just pump into roth until then?
[21:36:10] <PattyCakes> shakygator, honestly curious. Are these types of gigs the kind where I go "home" at 5pm all the time
[21:36:18] <sd> 14<K​illnine> But then they match $1/$1 up to 8%
[21:36:19] <PattyCakes> and the work load is reasonable?
[21:36:21] <shakygator> well im full remote, so im always home
[21:36:25] <PattyCakes> I know same here
[21:36:27] <PattyCakes> but you know what I meant
[21:36:35] <shakygator> well, depends on the exact team/company
[21:36:36] <PattyCakes> that's why it was in quotes :P
[21:36:44] <shakygator> my team is very adamant about work/personal life balance
[21:36:54] <shakygator> but we do have oncall rotations
[21:37:03] <DrGibby> PublicWifi / signofzeta you rang?
[21:37:12] <shakygator> so there are times im expected to respond, but we have secondary/tertiary response too so its not all on me. if im playing hockey i aint responding
[21:37:19] <signofzeta> DrGibby: yeah, just a dumb fart joke
[21:37:28] <DrGibby> no fart jokes are dumb
[21:37:32] <shakygator> agile team here on 2 week sprints so basically do your work, dont be a nob, and youre okay
[21:37:34] * DrGibby farts gibbyfarts.com/#nft
[21:37:37] <shakygator> for another company i cant say
[21:37:38] <PattyCakes> I'm at just under 130k, probably doing the same thing you are - it's just my job is with people I've worked with for years elsewhere, and the workload is like amazing
[21:37:47] <signofzeta> oh schnikes, there's an NFT?
[21:37:52] <DrGibby> indeed
[21:37:57] <PattyCakes> some weeks we have our plates full, but it's always 40hrs and we're done
[21:38:00] <DrGibby> an honest-to-goodness NFT
[21:38:04] <PattyCakes> some weeks I spend on IRC talking about roth IRAs
[21:38:05] * signofzeta counts his 0.0000001 BTC to see if he has more somehow
[21:38:15] <PattyCakes> that's the balance I require. More money is nice, but if it's more money for more work
[21:38:16] <PattyCakes> count me out
[21:38:24] <shakygator> PattyCakes, yeah thats why i dont wanna leave my company. im comfortable. but i can get a fat raise to leave if i just tried (no like change)
[21:38:30] <DrGibby> speaking of, I'm pretty gassy today
[21:38:40] <PattyCakes> we can sneeze and be employed tomorrow shakygator 
[21:38:44] <PattyCakes> and that's not even ego or being cocky
[21:38:47] <shakygator> i know thats why i need to try
[21:38:50] <shakygator> its the reality
[21:39:13] <shakygator> trust me i have imposter syndrome all day every day
[21:39:23] <PattyCakes> oh I got over that
[21:39:25] <shakygator> but ive been around long enough i do actually know what im doing
[21:39:32] <PattyCakes> Just admit you're stupid
[21:39:33] <PattyCakes> if they keep paying you
[21:39:34] <PattyCakes> win win
[21:39:46] <shakygator> i work with plenty of stupid people
[21:39:49] <PattyCakes> I routinely am stupid
[21:39:55] <PattyCakes> I just average more smarts than I do dumbs
[21:40:27] <shakygator> the guy that took over this other (very big) app was asking me last week about route53 as a global load balancer, etc. he was showing me A records saying shit like "this over here, its a label, it doenst matter!"
[21:40:35] <shakygator> the A record
[21:40:39] <shakygator> doesnt matter, cuz he didnt have NS pointed
[21:41:14] <PattyCakes> Yea, had to stop letting it make me mad when I know damn well the idiot on the other end makes more than I do
[21:41:28] <shakygator> hes probably 4x me
[21:41:35] <PattyCakes> sounds about right lol
[21:41:42] <signofzeta> don't even try getting him to understand AAAA records.  "Oh, I don't need those.  GoDaddy Network Solutions web hosting told me to add an A record four times."
[21:41:52] <DrGibby> ...
[21:41:54] <PattyCakes> ...
[21:42:16] <shakygator> i had this other team, similar situation want me to run ops, beat me up over 10k raise (i actually wanted 30) and instead they hired someone else and still call me expecting me to respond
[21:42:25] <shakygator> went to my boss last week for "consulting help"
[21:42:57] *** Quits: monr0e (~monr0e@mail.vixen.international) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[21:42:58] <PattyCakes> My mom is a director of IT where she is. The CEO routinely crypto locks the network, makes A/P send out checks to obvious scammers, etc
[21:43:33] <PattyCakes> It entertains me the stories she tells
[21:44:00] <Bru^> :O

[21:45:03] <signofzeta> Perhaps the CIO needs to have a vision-related accident -- like not seeing a company run him over on a sidewalk.
[21:45:17] <PattyCakes> Yea, good luck dictating that the boss can't click on things from his personal email
[21:45:33] <PattyCakes> at the end of the day, the paychecks get signed. She's gotta work around the bullshit
[21:45:37] <PattyCakes> I on the other hand would have left lol
[21:45:55] <signofzeta> oh, his personal email.  shit, can you somehow mitigate that on the corporate network?
[21:46:01] <PattyCakes> HE OWNS THE COMPANY
[21:46:03] <PattyCakes> sorry, caps
[21:46:13] <signofzeta> maybe you need to chat with the Board of Directors about getting a new CEO.
[21:46:29] <int0x1C8> yep he's CEO, so no rules apply to him
[21:46:30] <PattyCakes> hahahahaha, board of directors - you mean the owner and his wife

[21:47:25] <int0x1C8> our CEO is kinda the same
[21:47:33] <shakygator> just run
[21:47:34] <PattyCakes> signofzeta, at that point - he'd just get angry she spent time on the power point
[21:47:39] <PattyCakes> and send a scammer another 100k
[21:47:43] * PattyCakes shrugs
[21:48:09] <int0x1C8> kept bitching about the cell service in his vacation home down in florida, which happens to be a purely concrete structure
[21:48:29] <Bru^> int0x1C8: why didnt you fix it for them!?!?!
[21:48:31] <signofzeta> Yeah, at that point, I'd try and join The Great Resignation
[21:48:33] <Bru^> :))
[21:48:34] <int0x1C8> he wanted us to fly down there and install a cell signal booster for him
[21:48:46] <PattyCakes> She's at retirement age signofzeta, she's riding the ship down
[21:48:48] <Bru^> bitch use wifi calling
[21:49:16] <int0x1C8> he does now, at the time us cellular didn't have it enabled
[21:49:19] <signofzeta> PattyCakes: Oh, okay.
[21:49:22] <Bru^> oh gotcha
[21:49:31] <int0x1C8> or at least you had to have certain phones for it
[21:49:31] <Bru^> send him one of those femtocells
[21:49:32] <PattyCakes> built up enough tenure that she really does as she pleases - if the CEO fucks something up badly, she has no problems calling that diamond level support at Microsoft
[21:49:34] <PattyCakes> you know, the one that's $500 just for the ticket
[21:49:48] <Bru^> PattyCakes: IF they even fix it
[21:49:49] <Bru^> too
[21:49:59] <PattyCakes> They'll keep throwing money at it til it's done
[21:50:05] <PattyCakes> no business being in business
[21:50:08] <PattyCakes> makes no god damn sense
[21:50:12] <PattyCakes> but her paychecks clear every pay day
[21:50:27] <int0x1C8> and since his house is close to our warehouse location he gets free internet by wireless point to point, which of course we have to support
[21:50:37] <PattyCakes> OMG int0x1C8 
[21:50:38] <PattyCakes> LOL
[21:50:41] <PattyCakes> She did the same thing
[21:50:48] <PattyCakes> I helped her install a ubiquiti on the roof
[21:50:57] <PattyCakes> to beem the office internet across the street to his townhouse
[21:51:07] <Bru^> hahaha
[21:51:17] <PattyCakes> you bet your ass I charged premium rates on that invoice
[21:51:20] <Bru^> if secret put a 20Mb traffic cap on that 
[21:51:22] <int0x1C8> climbing up on his roof and aligning antennas, and his house is too big for the signal to reach the main AP, so there's a wifi connected wifi point
[21:51:25] <PattyCakes> look, if he's gonna just throw away money, PattyCakes is gonna get some
[21:51:32] <Bru^> ^
[21:51:42] <int0x1C8> which has problems all the time, and he is incapable of successfully power cycling a goddamn wifi AP
[21:51:56] <Bru^> int0x1C8: install a smart switch
[21:51:58] <PattyCakes> She really could have it far worse, at least this company will spend money
[21:52:00] <Bru^> do it from your phone
[21:52:03] <PattyCakes> I've worked for enought o know that's rare
[21:52:05] <Bru^> or schedule a daily off/on
[21:52:21] <int0x1C8> oh and he didn't get charged ofc
[21:52:38] <int0x1C8> he has us do landscaping shit every year and it just doesn't get billed
[21:52:47] <Bru^> wat?
[21:54:17] <PattyCakes> This is the same company I quoted $6k to run 15 drops of cable through a drop ceiling - They ended up not picking me because of some sort of implied liability
[21:54:27] <PattyCakes> like PattyCakes doesn't come with his own insurance, releases of liability, etc
[21:54:35] <PattyCakes> So I sent to the lead to a buddy, he got the job
[21:54:38] <PattyCakes> and I got a little taste
[21:54:46] <Bru^> sweet and salty
[21:54:55] <Bru^> love dat MSP lyfe
[21:55:32] <PattyCakes> My taste was him coming over to the house to crawl through my atttic and run more ethernet
[21:55:40] <PattyCakes> treat your network good, and good things happen
[21:55:46] <Bru^> yep
[21:56:18] <int0x1C8> and the CEO's spoiled grandkids just steal gas from the company pumps all the time
[21:56:35] <PattyCakes> yea, I could go on all day on nepotism
[21:56:50] <PattyCakes> CEO's daughter, literally burned her house down because she "forgot" the stove when she left
[21:57:16] <PattyCakes> guess who got a new house, that now has a "wing" that's owned by the company
[21:57:26] <PattyCakes> the wing is a closet, the entire house was built on company money
[21:57:33] <PattyCakes> fraud? 100% yes
[21:57:37] <PattyCakes> prove it? make the case? yea, good luck
[21:57:48] <Bru^> ugh
[21:58:00] <Bru^> drives me nuts
[21:58:07] <PattyCakes> like bro, I have 1 house
[21:58:11] <PattyCakes> Do you know how many times I check the stove
[21:58:13] <Bru^> my last job was family owned
[21:58:24] <Bru^> fortunately the grandparents/parents/kids
[21:58:24] <PattyCakes> but w/e - not my money, not my kids, not my choices
[21:58:27] <Bru^> were put to work from the ground up
[21:58:32] <int0x1C8> CEO's wife complained endlessly about us not supporting or getting iphones on our corporate account
[21:58:40] <Bru^> son wants to join teh family business? sweet, he started as a merch, then driver, etc.
[21:58:49] <int0x1C8> we kept telling her if she got an iphone we'd no longer be able to help her with technical issues and such
[21:58:51] <PattyCakes> I mean, I want a happy medium Bru^
[21:59:03] <Bru^> dont see that all the time though
[21:59:08] <PattyCakes> like if my dad owned a company, and I had marketable skills, I'd hate to be punished as the low man for years
[21:59:10] <int0x1C8> her daughter nagged her into getting an iphone and guess who still complains to us when it doesn't work?
[21:59:17] <Bru^> that family brought in the family to work, but made them start from the bottom
[21:59:20] <Bru^> all good people
[21:59:21] <PattyCakes> like, I get you built this empire, and I'm glad you did
[21:59:24] <PattyCakes> but I also am your kid
[21:59:33] <PattyCakes> I do get a little break, not a life changing break
[21:59:38] <PattyCakes> but don't make me mop floors when I can wirte code
[21:59:39] <Bru^> yeah
[21:59:39] <int0x1C8> luckily we have her son's (COO) support in saying "no"
[21:59:52] <Bru^> PattyCakes: I think the work needs to be put in though too
[21:59:55] <Bru^> like you said, happy medium
[22:00:06] <PattyCakes> It's never though, as you said
[22:00:23] <Bru^> we were short drivers one time, and the CEO himself came in at 3am for shift and hopped in a truck to do the route
[22:00:33] <PattyCakes> either the kid is worked to the bone, and eventually gets the company - sure he earned it, but I'd like to help my kids a little bit
[22:00:36] <PattyCakes> at least give them the chance to fuck it up
[22:00:42] *** Quits: trekkie1701c (~trekkie17@user/trekkie1701c) (Quit: :P)
[22:00:47] <PattyCakes> and then you have the parents who commit fraud to build their kid a new house
[22:00:51] <Bru^> yeah
[22:02:31] <PattyCakes> as a kid with almost.0 breaks, I get salty when I see family businesses that treat their kids the same you got treated. Isn't the entire point of having kids to provide them a better life than you had?  
[22:03:10] <Bru^> truth
[22:03:11] <Bru^> like you said though
[22:03:13] <PattyCakes> and now I'm ranting about kids again lol.
[22:03:13] <Bru^> happy medium
[22:03:38] <Bru^> generational benefit
[22:03:50] <Bru^> but they also needs to learn hard/smart work
[22:03:51] <PattyCakes> I have plenty of people in my life I can make miserable without having to change their diapers
[22:03:53] <Bru^> earn
[22:03:57] <PattyCakes> why would I do that to my own kid
[22:04:10] <int0x1C8> one of the CEO's other kids works in retail and does basically nothing
[22:04:13] <DrZak> preparation for furthe life
[22:04:18] <Bru^> have them learn to work hard/smart?
[22:04:19] <int0x1C8> our retail store*
[22:04:22] <Bru^> in general
[22:04:41] <DrZak> funny thing is even hardcore psychology professionals fuck up their kids
[22:04:42] <PattyCakes> There's prep for life DrZak, and there's mental abuse. Being "wise beyond your years" and "mature for your age" isn't a compliment
[22:04:53] <PattyCakes> it's the result of having to make it on your own from a young age
[22:04:54] <DrZak> expecting a workign couple to make it is ironic
[22:04:59] <int0x1C8> she got approved to work from home even though she works in retail
[22:05:00] <PattyCakes> it's survival, not a compliment
[22:06:22] <Bru^> yeah
[22:06:23] <PattyCakes> It's pure abuse when you have the financial ability to set your kid of for success, but make them figure it out on their own.
[22:06:37] <Bru^> yeah thats shitty
[22:06:45] <Bru^> parents are supposed to guide their kids
[22:06:49] <Bru^> prepare them for adulthood
[22:06:49] <PattyCakes> That's not teaching them life lessons, that's just being a dick
[22:06:50] <PattyCakes> yea
[22:06:58] <int0x1C8> its also super annoying that the CEO and his family are SUPER religious
[22:07:06] <Bru^> int0x1C8: supply side jesus is not real jesus
[22:07:32] <PattyCakes> and it's even more abuse to act like you as the parent deserve more time/love/dedication in return for all that financial success they had
[22:07:35] <int0x1C8> like my first day working here the CEO's wife had to do that weird "let us pray" thing and hold my hands and pray for me
[22:07:44] <int0x1C8> was super fucking uncomfortable
[22:07:51] <PattyCakes> like "You better take care of me in my old age, there's a pay out involved"
