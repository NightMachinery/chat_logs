[06:02:00] <BrokenClutch> What you guys use to make games?
[06:02:04] <BrokenClutch> (besides haskell, ofc)
[06:03:28] <EvanR> I'm using SDL and GLFW
[06:03:33] <EvanR> and JuicyPixels
[06:03:57] <BrokenClutch> How you handle events?
[06:04:15] <EvanR> what do you mean
[06:04:23] <EvanR> with GLFW
[06:04:33] <BrokenClutch> How do you handle events? Like, do you create callbacks?
[06:05:06] <EvanR> GLFW makes you use callbacks at least to get hook up to the world
[06:05:22] <EvanR> mouse move callback, user typing callbac
[06:05:23] <BrokenClutch> cool
[06:05:50] <BrokenClutch> I wanted to use raw SDL, I'm trying to think in a way to make it more sane
[06:06:52] <EvanR> SDL is good but no reason to subject yourself to the C API unless you really have to
[06:07:50] <BrokenClutch> EvanR: I'm a fan of suffering
[06:08:38] <EvanR> when I want "raw" access, I use native system stuff, like quartz
[06:08:59] <EvanR> or apple core audio
[06:19:29] <sm> readLine/putStrLn, FunGEn, sdl2, ansi-terminal-game so far BrokenClutch 
[06:20:21] <sm> gloss, fltkhs, monomer, keid are other things not yet mentioned
[06:20:36] <sm> dear-imgui-hs...
[06:21:06] <sm> godot bindings... 
[06:21:17] <sm> it would be interesting to see a chart of how many real games have been made with each
[06:23:31] <sm> Merry Christmas ðŸŽ„ Holidays ðŸŒ´ Friday, all
