[00:27:35] <jr> it's worked pretty well for us
[00:28:00] <MoonBounce> yeah the problem is
[00:28:09] <MoonBounce> most of my users just RDP to their workstation machine
[00:28:17] <MoonBounce> so we've been lenient and letting them use both side by side
[00:28:26] <MoonBounce> guess i just gotta lay down the law

[00:36:22] <oxipital> whats the pricing like?
[00:36:42] <oxipital> for WVD
[00:37:26] <jr> as long as you have windows/microsoft 365 licensing or RDS CALs, there's no additional cost

[00:41:27] <MoonBounce> yeah ive always wondered how VDI holds up against developers who need

[00:42:08] <sd> 11<c​hicken lit tool> A separate vm is triggered upon submission to this db. It reads the content and creates the actual file once again and stores it locally. The cell in the remote DB is then scrubbed clean in case it's ever compromised

[00:44:33] <sd> 11<c​hicken lit tool> Plus it gives me the ability to implement threat checking on the contents before casting them back out for employees to download

[07:07:05] <xe0n> that's because they want to hire people who have invested time into their career

[07:09:10] <xe0n> yes, experience is one thing, but the extra "oomf" is you going out of your way to learn the theory side of things as well, and be formally recognised for it

[10:09:49] <e1> yes
[10:09:52] <e1> port 80 is exposed
[10:09:58] <e1> grep -iR "80" /etc/httpd
[10:10:01] <e1> or /etc/apache2
[10:10:11] <A-KO> sounds like ubuntu
[10:10:17] <e1> yeah
[10:10:18] <A-KO> ubuntu is the only one that uses /sites-enabled :P
[10:10:21] <e1> I haven't memorized it
[10:10:27] <Mark_Pinecone> no its debian
[10:10:28] <A-KO> but yeah, you're likely correct
[10:10:33] <A-KO> whatever same difference
[10:10:33] <A-KO> lol
[10:10:35] <e1> /etc/apache2/conf/httpd.conf ?
[10:10:50] <A-KO> there's probably a default listener of 80 in the file e1 is mentioning
[10:10:51] <e1> that grep will tell you where 80 is defined though. Look out for "Liste ::80"
[10:10:56] <Mark_Pinecone> so by default it serves port 80 from /var/www/http
[10:10:56] <A-KO> ^
[10:11:03] <A-KO> check your config files

[18:38:39] <oxipital> one of them was near the infected whoever
[18:38:40] <sintax> they've had every chance to get it. but whatever.

[18:40:16] <oxipital> well, that was the first crash
[18:40:20] <Jaelae> ah yea

[18:59:55] <oxipital> not really vaporware

[19:01:37] <int0x1C8> oh they just launched it
[19:01:43] <oxipital> blue origins launch site is tiny too
[19:03:04] <int0x1C8> BO was founded 2 years before spacex
[19:03:17] <vinrock> yeh but musk blew past those jokers
[19:03:39] <oxipital> iterative testing for the win
[19:03:51] <oxipital> but in a lot of ways they're not reinventing the wheel
[19:03:59] <int0x1C8> and spacex beat them to orbital capability by only 13 years
[19:04:05] <oxipital> yeah
[19:04:24] <oxipital> i'm sure blue origin will be a great joyride for rich people
[19:04:26] <oxipital> that's fine
[19:04:49] <oxipital> bezos should just drop launch and get to working on habitation
[19:05:01] <int0x1C8> wait the flight they just did was still suborbital
[19:05:06] <oxipital> then combine forces with musk to form....devastator
[19:05:37] <vinrock> musk should be like smell ya later and launch to his mars lair
[19:05:52] <oxipital> i think a lot of blue origins time was spent on making space flight comfortable
[19:06:00] <oxipital> the inside of the capsules all padded and shit

[19:17:16] <oxipital> i mean they're using batteries, cool

[19:21:27] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> Server 2019 is an LTSC release
[19:21:32] <oxipital> i'm watching some robo narrated video about the engine
[19:21:33] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> Yes it is
[19:21:33] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> if it's a server release, that's different, i suppose
[19:21:42] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> SAC releases of server are server core only, etc
[19:21:45] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> It's Win10 LTSC 1809
[19:21:49] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> that Ada is using
[19:21:53] <int0x1C8> anything bigger than the Rutherford engine wouldn't work because you'd need too much battery mass
[19:21:55] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> *shrug* I mean, if they're using it as a server, it's whatever
[19:22:13] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> using LTSC is pants on head retarded if it's being used as a workstation though
[19:22:18] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> true... because LTSC will require a full reinstall when a new version comes out
[19:22:21] <MikeSpears> sup nerds
[19:22:29] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> that's not even the primary reason
[19:22:30] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> lol
[19:22:36] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> not even close, though it is a good reason
[19:22:40] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> either way
[19:22:45] <sd> 10<L​iteral_Sperg> Unless you're using Win10 like a box for X Service, don't use LTSC
[19:22:56] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> What would *you* claim is the primary reason? @Hunterkll
[19:23:08] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> API support, security functionality, management functionality, etc
[19:23:27] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> i've seen a lot of people get jammed up for deploying LTSC and then software upgrades come along requiring X minimum windows version for Y api reason
[19:23:32] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> Adobe software and games come to mind
[19:23:38] <int0x1C8> so the electron is right at the threshold where it's big enough to launch cube sats and such, and small enough that electric turbopumps are feasible which makes the engines super cheap to fabricate
[19:23:47] <sd> 10<L​iteral_Sperg> Just pay for Enterprise licensing
[19:23:50] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> And for the longest time, the minimum build approved for STIG/gov use was above the current LTSC releases for several years
[19:23:55] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> @Literal_Sperg you have to in order to get LTSC
[19:23:56] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> lol
[19:24:00] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> that's literally how you get it
[19:24:17] <sd> 10<L​iteral_Sperg> Soz. Just install enterprise, not LTSC.
[19:24:20] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> i know there's a few other channels, but 99% of people who have access to LTSC do it through Enterprise
[19:24:21] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> right

[21:07:27] <signofzeta> At this point, TLS 1.2 is supported by dang near everything.
[21:07:35] <signofzeta> Only Windows 7 doesn't use it by default, but there's a registry tweak.

[21:10:13] <signofzeta> Good point, @sea.  I guess if you're lucky enough to have your CAS role and transport roles on different servers, then you can harden it a little.
[21:10:19] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> and those that don't are already sending unencrypted by default anyway
[21:10:34] <sd> 06<A​da> i've got exchange behind a reverse proxy for both http and smtp so i dont have to worry particularly
[21:11:21] <sd> 13<s​ea> So I'm not sure if I would disable TLSv1.0-1.1. A server will always use the highest, so most will already use TLSv1.2. All others will then use 1.0-1.1 which might be better than emails not arriving.
[21:11:30] <sd> 06<A​da> thanks, gonna copy paste that into my global

[23:05:17] <sintax> i'm gonna throw things at an end user. my screen flickers when i unplug and plug my laptop in to a dock. no kidding...ya don't say....
[23:06:00] <JollyRgrs> sintax: simple solution. stop being a helpdesk bitch
[23:06:19] <sintax> JollyRgrs: i'm working on it. i've been doing IT 3 years and slowly getting out of it. 
[23:06:50] <sd> 11<t​elgareith> how do I figure out all of Frontier FiOS's available IPs are?
[23:06:53] <sintax> right now though i'm low man on the totem pole where im at now but i get to do everything so....yeah. plus its a ticket that just came in. i'm just going to let it sit. 
[23:06:58] <sd> 11<t​elgareith> can I even do that, i'm thinking no
[23:07:12] <JollyRgrs> sintax: there's hope. i did retail IT for 8 yrs... then helpdesk bitch for another year before I got anywhere
[23:07:43] <sintax> I'll get there. I'm not worried about it. Just shaking my head. 
[23:08:31] <sintax> half tempted to send an email back to them full of jargon and why it flickers and blah blah blah
[23:13:54] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> 3 years and you're still the bottom? Sounds like really low turnover
[23:14:11] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> Which is either really good or really bad
[23:15:01] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> hey everyone
[23:15:05] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> urgent question...
[23:15:24] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> what are some good phishing templates for 2021 relevant now?

[23:18:18] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> got one for hot single russians, but it's in German

[23:20:00] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> that's not helping lol
[23:22:45] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> was I trying to help... no
[23:22:51] <thegodsquirrel> Heh, cool new Zoom backgrounds
[23:23:16] <sd> 05<f​irebarber> anyone know the syntax for creating a conditional forwarder for a classless reverse lookup zone in AD DNS?
[23:23:47] <signofzeta> 2.0.192.in-addr.arpa or 8.b.d.1.0.0.2.ip6.arpa
[23:23:57] <signofzeta> err, sorry, missed the first part.

[23:24:53] <sd> 05<f​irebarber> I think the syntax is the same for a classless reverse lookup zone but I don’t know how to do that either
[23:24:56] *** Joins: Rpifan (~Rpifan@user/rpifan)
[23:24:59] <sd> 05<f​irebarber> Needs to be larger than /24
[23:25:38] <sd> 05<f​irebarber> Microsoft docs only show how to create a subnet
[23:26:17] <signofzeta> I don't think Microsoft DNS Server supports classless reverse anything.  I tried to make a reverse zone for a /25 and it flat-out refused to do it.  If I entered it manually, DHCP wouldn't write any entries to it.
[23:27:02] <veam> Anyone using Teams thru RDP?
[23:27:16] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> yes
[23:27:17] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> me
[23:27:17] <sintax> you're rdp'ing into a machine to use teams?
[23:27:22] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> yes
[23:27:29] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> over a 10gbps udp connection
[23:27:31] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> lol
[23:27:37] <sd> 05<f​irebarber> dynamic updates don’t work with subnetted reverse lookup zones, which is annoying
[23:27:38] <sintax> ha
[23:27:44] <veam> rdping into a system to do work and also use teams in my case
[23:28:12] <veam> whenever some get s a call RDP crashes if webcams are on
[23:28:20] <veam> some gets*
[23:28:20] <sintax> use rdp to get to teams and then use teams to see another pc
[23:28:22] <veam> shit
[23:28:26] <veam> someone gets*
[23:28:38] <sintax> we blocked webcams over rdp because it eats up resources server side. 
[23:28:43] <sintax> we made people do it locally
[23:29:13] <veam> that's my thought as well but management made it a requirement to have cameras on during calls -_- 
[23:29:14] <signofzeta> Microsoft only officially supports camera redirection over LAN, not WAN.  Still, I had a customer using it through RD Gateway 2008 R2 (no UDP support at all!) and they said it was great.
[23:29:39] <veam> We are dong it over both LAN and WAN
[23:29:48] <veam> we only have issues with people on LAN
[23:29:58] <veam> I don't understand what the issue is
[23:30:29] <sd> 04<O​ddyKnocky> Anyone know of a good alternative to Task Scheduler? Just found we are running 100s of business critical tasks through task scheduler and they're super disorganized, hard to sort, and subject to Task Scheduler wonky-ness
[23:30:40] <sd> 06<o​nenerdyguy> what kind of jobs?
[23:30:45] <sd> 06<o​nenerdyguy> also, who thought this was a good idea
[23:31:00] <sd> 04<O​ddyKnocky> Most of them are sending emails to my knowledge but I'm not 100%
[23:31:24] <sd> 04<O​ddyKnocky> Lmao apparently it's an old system that just kept getting bigger until now when it's a mess to manage
[23:31:49] <sd> 06<o​nenerdyguy> you want some kind of am RPA tool. I like VisualCron

[23:50:00] <sd> 06<o​nenerdyguy> we use Visualcron to replae Winautomate, that got bought by Microsoft. We like it

[23:51:00] <sd> 04<O​ddyKnocky> It's more than sending email unfortunately, just heard back and he said it also runs imports, exports, file transfers, etc
[23:51:00] <JollyRgrs> "just sending emails" or like "doing a bunch of stuff, then sending the logs or a report as an email when complete"?
[23:51:22] <sd> 06<o​nenerdyguy> yeah. these apps will do that
[23:51:23] <JollyRgrs> yeah, sounds like you def. need something to manage that
[23:51:25] <JollyRgrs> yup
[23:51:28] <sd> 04<O​ddyKnocky> The latter
[23:51:37] <sd> 04<O​ddyKnocky> Neat, thank you guys very much
[23:51:45] <sintax> thats a lot to ask task scheduler to do and not have it in any kind of order. 
[23:51:46] <sintax> eek
[23:51:54] <sd> 04<O​ddyKnocky> Oh yea it's brutal
[23:51:58] <sd> 04<O​ddyKnocky> They aren't even in folders
[23:52:02] <sintax> o.O
[23:52:07] <sintax> that's def painful then. 
[23:52:09] <JollyRgrs> eek
[23:52:18] <JollyRgrs> well, tbh... might be easier not being in folders
[23:52:19] <sintax> amazing it's all still working correctly
[23:52:28] <JollyRgrs> think about trying to hunt down a specific task looking in all the folders
[23:52:31] <sintax> maybe, i was just thinking organization with folders
[23:52:35] <sintax> true
[23:52:38] <JollyRgrs> i'd have to get REAL good at PS task querries
[23:53:28] <sintax> for sure.
[23:53:41] <sintax> i'm slowly teaching myself PS
[23:53:49] <sintax> try to use it instead of a gui
