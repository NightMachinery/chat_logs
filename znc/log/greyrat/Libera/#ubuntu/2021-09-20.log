[00:11:29] <alkisg> I think you should ask this in #archlinux, not in #ubuntu, for example https://www.maketecheasier.com/install-deb-package-in-arch-linux/ says you can use "debtap" to convert a .deb into an archlinux package
[00:11:32] <Dax2051> I'll try. Thank you Vitus.
[00:11:36] <vitus`> I have seen this post online: https://archived.forum.manjaro.org/t/solved-install-a-program-from-another-repository/155603
[00:12:27] <vitus`> it contains a link to a tutorial how to convert .deb packages to arch linux packages, but the app I just posted is not in the debian repository, so I am completely overwhelmed

[02:45:48] <TJ-> obby: what you're actually referring to, is addding a kernel command-line option that the tooling in the initrd.img scripts reads from /proc/cmdline ... but if cryptsetup isn't installed in the initrd.img that won't help

Early this week we had someone else with the same issue; and there it turned out a kernel module being loaded from initrd was responsible. We discovered that by using "break=top" which drops to the busybox shell even before it tries to load kernel modules. You might try that, if you do get a shell, you know where the issue is

[18:43:30] <Xiol> Afternoon all. I'm having some trouble with the HP servers we have in that the SD card reader is enumerated as /dev/sda, then the RAID array as /dev/sdb. The HP documentation suggests adding `rd.driver.pre=smartpqi` to the kernel command line at boot time to ensure the RAID array is enumerated first, and this works fine for our RHEL installations, however that's a dracut option which isn't going to work for Ubuntu. Does anyone know
[18:43:30] <Xiol> what the equivalent option to `rd.driver.pre` is for Ubuntu? `rd.modules_load` looks promising however I'm not sure this will load the driver early enough.
