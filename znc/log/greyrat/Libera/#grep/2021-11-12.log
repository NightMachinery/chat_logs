[19:27:27] <OnlineCop> If anyone in here could set a /topic, could it include something akin to "Please indicate your grep version"?
[19:28:19] <OnlineCop> Mainly for the differences between GNU and BSD (especially MacOS) greps....
[19:38:29] <OnlineCop> Is the best way to report a grep bug by using the bug-grep mailing list (https://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/bug-grep)?

[23:47:01] <e36freak> if for GNU grep, yes
[23:54:50] *** ChanServ changes topic to 'Welcome to #grep | This is a low volume channel, please be patient and someone will answer when they're able | Regex: #regex | Please let us know the grep version you're using'
