[02:13:26] <Brekkjern> Jesus christ... The political climate in Norway is going to shit :(
[02:15:47] <gerikson> what now
[02:15:58] <Brekkjern> Literally on the 10 year "anniversary" of Utøya, the political right just went "LOL, not our problem!" when they were confronted with their role in the event
[02:16:01] <gerikson> right-wing populists gaining ground?
[02:16:31] <Brekkjern> Kinda, yeah
[02:16:32] <gerikson> Brekkjern: sickening
[02:16:37] <gerikson> but it's a classic play
[02:16:38] <gerikson> deflect
[02:16:41] <Brekkjern> Yeah
[02:17:00] <Brekkjern> >"Det er nemlig så utrolig mange av oss som ikke har en plass i den fascistiske drømmen om et samfunn renset for menneskelig mangfold"
[02:17:00] <Brekkjern> >Det er et paradoks siden hver gang noen fra venstresiden snakker om mangfold så mener de kun mangfold basert på etnisitet, ikke meninger og politisk standpunkt.
[02:17:13] <Brekkjern> Literally go fuck yourself
[02:18:50] <gerikson> same
[02:19:00] <Brekkjern> The first line there was written by someone who actually got shot at by neo-nazis back in the 90s for trying to help protect refugees and immigrants that were being bullied and attacked
[02:19:13] <gerikson> freeze peach
[02:20:12] <Brekkjern> I bet the worst the responding guy has ever experienced was the charging cable being a bit too far away when his phone ran out of powerr
[02:20:19] <Brekkjern> Absolute fuckwit
