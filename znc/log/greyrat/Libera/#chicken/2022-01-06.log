[22:58:57] <wasamasa> sigh
[22:59:12] <wasamasa> I realize I've never made http-client use a custom user agent and struggle to make it do one
[22:59:35] <wasamasa> debugging with a netcat listener to see what requests it actually makes feels so dirty
[22:59:43] <wasamasa> but it works
[23:00:32] <wasamasa> I've been looking at the intarweb tests to figure out the appropriate syntax because the documentation one look wrong
[23:01:26] <wasamasa> like, if it's supposed to be a list of 3-tuple lists of strings, why does it use ((("Mozilla" "5.0" ...) ...))?
[23:01:48] <wasamasa> perhaps it's meant to say (user-agent (("Mozilla" "5.0" ...) ...))
[23:09:51] <vandusen> "mario-goulart" pasted "http-client user-agent example" http://paste.call-cc.org/paste?id=21420af6b7fd69dd9f89fda8494949514e0e052a
[23:10:05] <wasamasa> duh
[23:10:07] <mario-goulart> wasamasa: I use this ^
[23:10:32] <wasamasa> I still believe the intarweb wiki is wrong on this one
[23:10:35] <wasamasa> but thank you
[23:10:42] <mario-goulart> yw
[23:11:38] <wasamasa> why do you quote the vector literal though?
[23:13:24] <mario-goulart> It' pre-R7RS.
[23:13:56] <wasamasa> it's not even using a vector in http-client
[23:14:12] <wasamasa> just a list of 3-tuples
[23:14:24] <mario-goulart> Hmm.  Is my example broken?
[23:14:38] <wasamasa> I wouldn't say broken, but it seems it could be simpler :D
[23:15:08] <mario-goulart> I can hardly get more convoluted for a user-agent "string". :-D

[23:16:45] <wasamasa> why would there even need to be several of them
[23:17:23] <wasamasa> before scheme I've never run into the finer details of the web, such as semicolons being valid separators in a query

[23:17:53] <wasamasa> I dunno, sometimes it feels like correctness is valued way more than simplicity
[23:18:17] <mario-goulart> I don't know, to be honest, but I think our web eggs tend to follow specs very respectfully.
[23:20:38] <mario-goulart> Speaking of which, some days ago I stumbled upon https://bugs.python.org/issue42967 . sjamaan: might be of your interest (so to speak -- more like "oh, no").
[23:21:39] <wasamasa> sigh, caches
[23:23:21] <wasamasa> basically, the problem with this vulnerability class is that you have a proxy/cache/whatever in front of your web application and it parses requests differently
[23:23:39] <wasamasa> at least it's pretty tricky to detect, let alone exploit
[23:23:52] <mario-goulart> One of the comments says "But the W3C standards evolved and now suggest against considering semicolon (";") as a separator".
[23:25:33] <wasamasa> the solution is apparently to make both parse the url the same way
[23:52:59] <florz> the solution is to not change standards in backwards-incompatible ways
[23:53:01] <vandusen> [eggs repo (r40984, by wasamasa)] intarweb: Correct user-agent example
[23:55:01] <florz> and also, to not forward stuff that you parse--if you parse it, then re-serialize it before sending it elsewhere, that avoids many vulnerabilities due to parser differences
[23:55:09] <wasamasa> true
[23:55:17] <wasamasa> SSRF wouldn't be a thing if you heeded that practice
[23:55:34] <wasamasa> parse and work with the parse result, rather than letting someone else parse it again
