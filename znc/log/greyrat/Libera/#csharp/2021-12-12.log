[00:03:56] <MatthiasVance> lara99: Are you doing the measurement by character?
[00:04:07] <lara99> yes
[00:04:28] <MatthiasVance> "The MeasureString method is designed for use with individual strings and includes a small amount of extra space before and after the string to allow for overhanging glyphs."
[00:04:39] <MatthiasVance> It's meant for strings, not characters
[00:04:54] <MatthiasVance> Read the remarks in the docs, they give more info
[00:05:04] <lara99> damn
[00:05:11] <lara99> what should I use then?
[00:06:29] <MatthiasVance> idk didn't have to deal with that use case
[00:06:42] <MatthiasVance> Why can't you just use MeasureString, but with the full string?
[00:07:09] <lara99> because I also need to set the letter spacing
[00:07:22] <MatthiasVance> Why?
[00:07:51] <lara99> to adhere with the graphic space at my disposal
[00:08:29] <MatthiasVance> Ahh but why use measure then? There is Draw* which you can give hints to (same as Measure)
[00:08:41] <MatthiasVance> Maybe you are missing hints? Have you looked at them?
[00:09:01] <lara99> what do you mean?

[00:10:04] <lara99> what hints?

[01:31:12] <Nasp> Lifetime means 10 years
[01:32:09] <bpmedley> I have a private repo that has some #if roslyn directives and enough mustache template conditionals that the public repo can be generated.  Also, both repos are currently building.. :-)
[01:32:10] <ap5> Nasp, yes. Bought it 3-4 years ago
[01:32:37] <ap5> But didnt know that it wasn't a lifetime license :O Broken
[01:33:11] <Nasp> Neither did i
[01:33:12] <bpmedley> That is true.  mIRC is so entrenched that you could buy 4-5 lifetime licenses over the years..

[01:36:49] <Nasp> But it's not fast enough as a router
[01:36:55] <Nasp> Need another mikrotik or device for that
[01:37:03] <_Shurik_> perhaps
[01:37:08] <Nasp> I was hoping it could route packages fast enough but it couldnt
[01:37:15] <Lukky> The gotcha though is the upload speed being limited to 60 Mbps
[01:37:22] <_Shurik_> what's the best router nowdays?  I'll go order one
[01:37:49] <Nasp> _Shurik_:  Some of the Mikrotiks are switched that can work as a router
[01:38:00] <Nasp> But they do not have enough CPU to do full 1gb
[01:38:07] <Nasp> Or missing hardware acceleration to do it

[01:50:23] <Lukky> MatthiasVance: yes, I wonder why they limit it so much...
[01:50:36] <MatthiasVance> Is it fiber?
[01:50:57] <Lukky> They probably want to avoid kids running websites in their parents' basement
[01:51:26] <Lukky> MatthiasVance: cable/coax... they certainly have fiber upstream, but I don't know
[01:52:07] <Lukky> Videotron
[01:53:30] <Nasp> Ofc they have fiber upstream
[01:53:42] <Nasp> Everything is
[01:54:14] <Lukky> Nasp: well, yes, of course, but I meant like locally, after the nearest hub
[01:54:49] <Lukky> Many ISPs boast about offering fiber, but not directly to your house
[01:54:54] <Nasp> Lol
[01:55:00] <Nasp> They c all it fiber when it's not last mile?
[01:55:18] <Nasp> Last mile is usually what denotes the name of the isntalaltion, because everything after that is fiber
[01:55:19] <Lukky> something like that
[01:55:30] <Nasp> So they call coax fiber?
[01:55:33] <Nasp> Or a DSL?
[01:55:36] <tlf> thats not how that works
[01:55:39] <Nasp> And are they allowed to do that
[01:56:07] <tlf> they limit it because the headends can only handle so much traffic at a time
[01:56:29] <Lukky> Mine is coax, and they don't mention fiber, but their most direct comptetion here even call their service "Fibe", but it's really DSL
[01:56:35] <tlf> just because transmission between COs is fiber, does not mean its fiber for the last mile
[01:56:57] <Lukky> Bell
[01:57:04] <tlf> copper is inherently expensive to maintain in comparision to fiber, so they're really trying to get rid of any usage of copper where they can

[01:57:24] <Nasp> Copper is just shit
[01:57:29] <tlf> copper has its place
[01:57:37] <Nasp> Not unusualy for copper to be 50 years old
[01:57:45] <Nasp> It's in quite poor condition
[01:57:53] <Nasp> Copper can't be used for shit
[01:58:05] <Nasp> It's coax of fiber, DSL is worthless
[01:58:07] <Nasp> or*
[01:58:09] <tlf> copper is actually pretty convenient
[01:58:19] <tlf> its very easy to ts, and very easy to fix
[01:58:22] <tlf> fiber, not so much
[01:58:37] <tlf> let me rephrase that, fiber's infrastructure not so much
[01:59:15] <tlf> copper's crux is that it has a finite limit to its use
[01:59:32] <tlf> but there's a reason why t1s are still around :)
[02:00:01] <Nasp> Copper = 20mbit on average
[02:00:04] <Lukky> What is fiber's claim as to its duration?
[02:00:11] <Nasp> duration?

[22:47:48] <Bilz> Quick one hopefully: if I'm binding to a List<SomeObject> in ItemSource a DataGrid in xaml (WPF), and then I have a bunch of columns and I use Binding={Binding SomeProperty}, where SomeProperty is a property on SomeObject. But in one of the columns, I want to bind to the actual SomeObject to pass to a ValueConverter. How do I do this?
[22:48:40] <Bilz> (my issue isn't how do I write the ValueConverter, or use the converter, but how do I write Binding={Binding SomeObject}
