[00:04:51] <larryv> userT: the general form is ''${array[@]:offset:length}''. if you omit the length -- ''${array[@]:start}'' -- the slice extends to the end
[00:05:52] <larryv> the offset and length are evaluated as arithmetic expressions, in which context "(2)" is just 2
[00:06:34] <userT> But for -2 I need (-2) indeed
[00:06:44] <xmb> you need a space after :
[00:06:48] <xmb> to make it not recognize as :-

[00:07:12] <larryv> that is false

[00:07:29] <larryv> a space works, as does wrapping the offset in parentheses

[01:22:47] <larryv> Kaedenn: pedantically speaking, the scope is the caller's. for instance, if you call f from another function that has already declared foo local, then foo=1 would not affect a foo at the topmost level

[01:23:01] <Kaedenn> `f=$(find_my_thing $1); if [[ -n "$f" ]]; then echo "THING=$f"; fi;`

[02:35:43] <Earnestly> (As for dpi, you shouldn't ever change it (in theory).  It should be left as a constant, just like fonts use 72 as a constant.  Sadly UI designers didn't use the same context, but 96 has become de facto.  From this the ideal is to use a scaling multiplier; i.e. points.  It's not ideal though, so finding right balance sometimes means faffing with this constant, which is a pity)
[02:38:32] <bud> not gonna lie, Inter is very readable at small sizes https://0x0.st/oqEk.png .

[07:53:07] <darwin> i usually used emacs to sort lines alphabetically, but say I have a text file of almost 1500 lines... is there a quicker way to sort them than selecting them all in emacs (might take a while if even possible?)
[07:53:38] <larryv> there is a standard command for sorting
[07:53:44] <larryv> it is named "sort"
[07:53:45] <viva> thank you xmb, i dont follow exactly what you mean by "its the filename i choose to edit"
[07:53:58] <llua> considering the hostmask, using emacs first isn't shocking

[07:54:33] <darwin> i use vi also; I've never been in the emacs vs vi war
[07:54:46] <darwin> though I don't know vi can sort lines
[07:54:55] <xmb> viva http://0x0.st/oq6F.sh made to your question
[07:55:08] <xmb> usage is files as args
[07:55:24] <xmb> and, i dunno handling of ffmpeg i think it was bad when file exists
[07:55:24] <gnoo> in emacs you can select the whole buffer with C-x h
[07:55:31] <xmb> i suggest some random value in the new name or something
[07:55:34] <darwin> good
[07:56:29] <larryv> darwin: are you planning on saving the sorted lines back to the same file?
[07:56:59] <darwin> actually I'm first combining three files (.newsrc from different NNTP servers) into one file but then afterwards will save them to the same file
[07:57:19] <darwin> after it's sorted...

[07:59:00] <viva> regarding my first question with zsh becoming standard on certain distros these days, kali, macos, etc... do we no longer call them bash scripts and just call them shell scripts as a catch all? or would calling them zsh scripts be technically correct? (but kinda cringe?)
[07:59:23] <xmb> viva, sad situation
[07:59:27] <e36freak> if they're written in/for zsh, they're zsh scripts

[12:49:34] <Payam69> chiselfuse well I can try. I ve starting reading the bash guide stated in the topic here.
[12:49:54] <malina> sounds like me walking up to the local supermarket and asking if I could be a technical director and get an office there.. "because I been a  loyal customer since 2012"
[12:49:57] <Payam69> malina No good reasons? I just gave you the reasons.
[12:49:57] <pj> Payam69: Let me ask you something, if a complete stranger walks up to you in the street and says to you, "Let me hold all your money for you while you go in that shop over there and I'll keep it safe", would you trust them?
[12:50:30] <malina> it just seems like you are on drugs Payam69 , and trust me, usually that's my job.
[12:51:21] <Payam69> pj my wallet no. I won't give anything personal to any one. and I won't ask for help if I can solve that. and I would also say that that comparison is no way near this situation so I would call your example way unrelated.

[12:52:07] <pj> It's completely related, nobody here knows you and no one is going to trust you with the keys to the channel.

[17:38:31] <pj> assuming that's what you're after ... indexing args with a variable and using the resulting arg as an index to another array (or a key to an associative array or something).  It's likely safer with the slice because it can only index the args that way whereas indirection can return the contents of any variable.

[20:19:14] <jelly> johnjaye, well there's your answer, you're in tmux.  tmux is an additional level of tty abstraction.
[20:20:04] <jelly> the shell is connected to a tmux-provided pty, not the linux vt tty
[20:20:12] <johnjaye> i'm testing in both. same result
[20:20:30] <johnjaye> basically i'm getting the imrpession i am correct and escape sequences can't be entered directly

[20:23:00] <jelly> oh, what are you trying to do, literally type esc [ 1 m and expecting the terminal to go BOLD?
[20:23:08] <Earnestly> johnjaye: I gave you a link https://www.linusakesson.net/programming/tty/ which explains this relationship
[20:23:16] <twkm> direction matters as well.
[20:23:17] <johnjaye> jelly: yes
[20:23:30] <johnjaye> Earnestly: and i told you what i gathered from reading the link
[20:24:02] <jelly> johnjaye, terminal can be put in a mode that echoes your input directly; that mode is OFF by default
[20:24:13] <twkm> your terminal doesn't react the same to bytes arriving from the tty as it does those arriving from the kbd.
[20:24:33] <Earnestly> jelly: The tty article explains this
[20:24:42] <Earnestly> And how curses and readline relate to it
[20:25:10] <Earnestly> Even what stty does and how it relates to termios

[20:25:39] <johnjaye> thanks i will read it in more detail then
[20:25:54] <johnjaye> and yes my naive understanding was you could just hit a few keys like ESC [ and then the code and it would read it
[20:26:09] <johnjaye> that's how i guessed terminals worked in the 60s.

[21:45:27] <ForeverNoob[m]> hi again, check this out: https://paste.debian.net/1236422/ ......... ok, so if I do: echo "hello" | sh script.sh -a -b  .......... I expect it to output: Message: Hello
[21:45:37] <ForeverNoob[m]> why am I dumb to think that?
[21:46:07] <twkm> does the script read from stdin?
[21:46:28] <ForeverNoob[m]> in other words: Why is it outputting an empty $message?
[21:46:41] <ForeverNoob[m]> yes I pipe the "hello" into it?
[21:46:44] <twkm> i suggest using xtrace to explore why.
[21:46:56] <xmb> yea it reads stdin, [[ -t 0 ]] and $( cat | perl )
[21:47:18] <xmb> [ -t not [[
[21:47:20] <twkm> -a reads stdin, emptying it.  then -b reads stdin, which is empty.
[21:47:38] <ForeverNoob[m]> xtrace as in sh -x ?
[21:47:42] <twkm> yes.
[21:47:42] <ramblebamble> ForeverNoob[m] because you are asking for parameters to the script
[21:48:02] <ForeverNoob[m]> so stdin is not copied?
[21:48:15] <twkm> the first cat ate it all.
[21:48:16] <ramblebamble> stdin is not a parameter
[21:48:29] <gnoo> the message is lost the first time you read it with cat
[21:48:30] <twkm> stdin isn't duplicated.
[21:48:40] <ForeverNoob[m]> aaaah

[21:48:45] <gnoo> and you overwrite the same variable later (with -b)
[21:48:49] <twkm> use just -a or just -b and all is well.
[21:49:01] <twkm> xtrace should show this.
[21:49:17] <phy1729> and maybe add an error if message is set
[21:49:19] *** Joins: funhouse (~funhouse@user/funhouse)
[21:49:21] <ForeverNoob[m]> yeah it did but I thought that was weird behavior
[21:50:22] <twkm> if one cat reads the pipe it can't suddenly reappear when a later cat comes to read, the data was consumed.
[21:50:31] <ForeverNoob[m]> I thought stdin could be shared between the cats but of course I should have better known that cats rarely share :)
[21:51:02] <ForeverNoob[m]> ok so this behavior was unknown to me before, I'll keep this in mind next time.

[23:34:54] <jb1277976> Whats a good find command that lets me see the creation date of a file?
[23:35:22] <phy1729> !wayttd
[23:35:23] <greybot> What Are You Trying To Do?
[23:36:29] <jb1277976> So im copy and moving files to folders, we are opening up each file and looking at what date it has (via whats inside dates times etc..) and sorting (long proccess) i want to speed up the proccess and check the creation date so i can just move by that date without opening the file
[23:37:00] <jb1277976> if that made any sense
[23:38:35] <jb1277976> i read somehwere about that stat command but i don't think its accurate

[23:38:56] <phy1729> not all file systems have creation time iirc
[23:39:06] <emg> jb1277976: if you can put the date in the filename, that's a much more sane solution
[23:39:26] <emg> in a sortable format e.g.   2022-04-01 my file
[23:40:14] <emg> jb1277976: but as phy1729 said, many file systems don't support creation date, and some OSes don't support accessing it even if the fs does support it
[23:40:25] <emg> so first you need to figure out if your fs/os combo let's you see creation date

[23:47:01] <Earnestly> phy1729: Generally more a case of statx(2) use, surprisingly well supported by filesystems - you'd probably have to list those that don't rather than do
