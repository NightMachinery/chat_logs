[00:00:00] <Satin> also slowly exerting geopolitical influence about its model to its neighbours
[00:00:09] <dfch> but its more about coding, than... you know rms stuff
[00:00:12] <Satin> countries like malaysia and SG are already borderline authoritian
[00:00:19] <Satin> they call themselves democracies
[00:00:27] <Satin> but they're more closer to state capitalism than anything
[00:00:29] <MootPoot> Can we remove the script part from JavaScript 
[00:00:37] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Satin: They also pretty much have a cultural history of regimes that really don't differ much from that to start with.
[00:00:45] <Satin> fair point
[00:00:46] <DaPinkOne> MootPoot, we should just universally call it JS and be done with it
[00:00:46] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Satin: And the life attitudes expected of those are already pre-existing.
[00:01:15] <Satin> but in general the Chinese/authoritian model is arguably more "effective" than this whole liberal democracy shit the west keeps peddling :^)
[00:01:23] <Satin> and you can believe it they're not going to keep it contained just within china or anything
[00:01:32] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Satin: On authoritarian yes. I mostly mean the rest of the baggage.
[00:01:46] <DaPinkOne> Satin, I think representative democracy is nice, and it'd be good if we really had it
[00:02:01] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Satin: Nominal domination of remote colonies is more likely to work than any attempt at direct leadership.
[00:02:08] <Satin> Aurora_v_kosmose: I guess on that part, I have to disagree as someone who's partly grown up a bunch over the years recently on discord and elsewhere and gradually seen stuff like chinese media and stuff slowly gain prominence
[00:02:14] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Because the leadership would manage to piss off the local too much.
[00:02:17] <Aurora_v_kosmose> *locals
[00:02:32] <Satin> Aurora_v_kosmose: it's not impossible at all for chinese culture and ccp styled values to start dominating and become more plausible alternatives
[00:02:43] <Satin> when the western model is proving to be powerless and ineffective, liberal democracies etc
[00:02:53] <Satin> yes the "default" for now as an ideal globally is'democracy" 
[00:02:59] *** Joins: ld_ (~a0z1@cpc158779-hari22-2-0-cust168.20-2.cable.virginm.net)
[00:03:01] <Satin> but it's changing quickly lmao
[00:03:04] *** ld_ is now known as a0z1
[00:03:05] <Satin> value systems change overnight
[00:03:27] <Satin> Aurora_v_kosmose: oh btw i'm not saying that china will try to become an empire or whatever like that, i'm just saying it'll export its model and way of doing things elsewhere
[00:03:42] <Satin> i agree 100% direct leadership is not exactly going to happen
[00:03:53] <Satin> that's not how things in the 21st century work
[00:04:07] <Satin> of course chinese culture has a unique colonial history etc they're deeply ashamed of and fighting against as well
[00:04:28] <Satin> they were stomped on by western colonial powers for the better half of the last 2 centuries
[00:05:15] <Satin> but all of these western leftists who are excitedly tell me they're happy to live in a more bi-polar world or whatever and give china a pass on some of this stuff are disgusting to me
[00:05:43] <Satin> i'm not sin-phobic or whatever, and the US is just as evil or sometimes more, but the US neoliberal system at least has a stab at change.
[00:06:00] <Aurora_v_kosmose> I really doubt their alignment is considered "left" anywhere outside of the US.
[00:06:01] <Satin> free speech and democratic values, all our cynicism rightfully of them aside, are far more fucking preferable than authoritian bullshit
[00:06:10] <Satin> Aurora_v_kosmose: these are european leftists too bro
[00:06:20] <Aurora_v_kosmose> How the mighty have fallen.
[00:06:23] <DaPinkOne> we should've had the second bill of rights.
[00:06:43] <Satin> even the furtherest far left leaning of my friends, who i agree with on so many things
[00:06:52] <Satin> subtly start giving china a pass or whatever on these things
[00:06:54] <DaPinkOne> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Bill_of_Rights would've been a big difference
[00:06:55] <ImoutoBot> [title] Second Bill of Rights - Wikipedia
[00:07:27] <Aurora_v_kosmose> "No privacy for thee but privacy for me" is one of the thing that pisses me off about a lot of governments.
[00:07:29] <Satin> I'm not very pro-liberalism, you know, but at the same time, come on. Just because the US is imperalistic and all of these other things we want to change
[00:07:45] <Satin> doesn't mean you should start supporting outright authortinism or stop condemming it
[00:08:02] <Aurora_v_kosmose> And basically all the authoritarian fuckwits everywhere seem to support that.
[00:08:02] <Satin> DaPinkOne: True.
[00:08:38] <Satin> this is just aimed at my own countrymen/women really
[00:08:49] <Satin> but i would like to see american leftists also stop the buck at criticism.
[00:08:49] <Omega037> morning yall
[00:08:55] <Omega037> we talking anime?
[00:08:57] <Omega037> or manga?
[00:09:07] <Satin> I know criticism is the centre piece for a lot of marxism/far left aspect, critique etc
[00:09:08] <DaPinkOne> Satin, what do you mean by "stop the buck at criticism"?
[00:09:09] <Satin> from the ivory tower
[00:09:16] <Roey> Satin: hey, leftists don't have to be accountable.
[00:09:17] <Satin> but they just stop there
[00:09:17] <dfch> Omega037, vtubers
[00:09:28] <Satin> and they're often pretty correct
[00:09:40] <Omega037> oh
[00:09:44] <Satin> that this country was founded on blood etc, and genocide and slavery etc and exposing hypocricies within the current status quo order
[00:09:47] <Satin> but then they just stop there
[00:09:52] <Satin> there's no vision for a new-america
[00:09:52] <DaPinkOne> Satin, direct action/praxis is the way, but it's risky, and there's an undercurrent of mccarthyism in the right's talking points
[00:09:57] <Omega037> I've been using my new Manga Fire device to finally go back and finish some manga
[00:10:03] <Roey> because they're not there to give constructive feedback
[00:10:04] <Roey> satin
[00:10:06] <Satin> they let the right wing now grab onto the american flag for example?
[00:10:10] <Omega037> Stuff that I originally read years ago and dropped when I got caught up
[00:10:18] <Satin> and now when you see a person with the flag on twitter or on their car in person
[00:10:22] <Satin> you know exactly what type of person that is
[00:10:29] <Satin> and what their political affifiation is
[00:10:49] <Satin> and so all "american nationalism" or symbolism has been taken over the right which is a travesty
[00:10:55] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Satin: One of the issues that causes problems to this day is that even USA was founded primarily at the behest of rich dudes that wanted to avoid local regulations.
[00:11:00] <DaPinkOne> Satin, from what I understand, in other countries it's cringe as fuck to show national symbolism like that
[00:11:00] <Aurora_v_kosmose> It had very little to do with rights.
[00:11:05] <Aurora_v_kosmose> In fact, it had to do with reducing them.
[00:11:07] <DaPinkOne> nationalism is weird
[00:11:13] <Satin> DaPinkOne: I grew up partly in india, it's not that weird over there
[00:11:17] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Nationalism is incomprehensible.
[00:11:22] <Satin> nationalism isn't bad
[00:11:27] <Satin> *as long as it's not the you know what type*'
[00:11:33] <Omega037> this seems like a convo for ##politics
[00:11:35] <Satin> H I T L E R 
[00:11:50] <Omega037> I'm going to go there and talk anime
[00:11:51] <DaPinkOne> Omega037, sorry, you're trying to be on-topic
[00:11:54] <Satin> Omega037: XD
[00:11:55] <dfch> Omega037, it really does
[00:12:03] * Aurora_v_kosmose rolls
[00:12:10] <DaPinkOne> but ##politics sucks, and I don't know any of those people
[00:12:10] * Satin clears throat
[00:12:25] <Aurora_v_kosmose> !g uwu god is dead
[00:12:26] <ImoutoBot> Aurora_v_kosmose: God is dead UwU : r/copypasta - Reddit <https://www.reddit.com/r/copypasta/comments/bb4i6k/god_is_dead_uwu/> | GOD IS DEAD OwO | SiTe - Bandcamp <https://site621.bandcamp.com/track/god-is-dead-owo> | God is dead - Wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_is_dead>
[00:12:31] <Satin> DaPinkOne: It's not about blind sort of nationalism though. Like. Isn't there a way to both say
[00:12:49] <DaPinkOne> Satin, you mean....patriotism? that's a word that exists
[00:12:51] <Satin> "Our country fucking sucks on this and this. But we can make this work. And yes we're built on this and this, but we can do new things together"
[00:12:55] <Satin> yeah i guess that's the word
[00:13:02] <Satin> but leftists are almost ashamed to celebrate independence day now etc
[00:13:16] <Satin> and there is fair good reason for that perhaps but you know, you can't have the new if you don't push for it
[00:13:26] <Aurora_v_kosmose> "Serving your country" almost always is at your expense for nohting.
[00:13:39] <DaPinkOne> Aurora_v_kosmose, having done that, imma disagree with you there
[00:13:46] <Satin> i half disagree aurora
[00:14:11] <Satin> i just happen to live in a country that's ...doing what it's doing in the middle east and so on which i'm ashamed about obviously.
[00:14:17] <Satin> but i don't think the idea is like that or anything.
[00:14:25] <Aurora_v_kosmose> There's very few things my country uniquely does well. Most others in the same region are practically interchangeable.
[00:14:25] <DaPinkOne> I compromised on my personal values, but I didn't come out of it with nothing. I don't have to take student loans, and though I sustained minor injuries, I'll be paid for the rest of my life for it
[00:14:39] <Satin> Aurora_v_kosmose: stop saying this, you refuse to tell your country :P
[00:14:43] <Aurora_v_kosmose> As far as individual life goes.
[00:14:43] <Satin> so now you're just playing tease
[00:14:49] <Satin> rude baka
[00:14:52] <Satin> !!!
[00:14:57] <dfch> sussy baka
[00:15:02] <Satin> this
[00:15:06] <Aurora_v_kosmose> owo
[00:15:10] <dfch> uwu
[00:15:14] <Satin> e.e
[00:15:21] <Aurora_v_kosmose> n.n
[00:15:49] <Satin> DaPinkOne: but yeah that's what pisses me off a lot about the american left. lots of Criticism TM, but no vision for a new national identity
[00:15:51] <dfch> c==8
[00:16:04] <Satin> and then they get shocked when it's the rightwingers who grab onto "American identity" or whatever
[00:16:06] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Anyway, if I would consider expatriation before dying for my country, it suggests they're not doing anything worth dying for them in the first place.
[00:16:10] <Satin> or get lots of votes fro mrural areas and what not
[00:16:10] <dfch> c equals 8
[00:16:24] <Aurora_v_kosmose> dfch: c0(k
[00:16:39] <Satin> there was ONE time
[00:16:40] <dfch> *sigh* ok...
[00:16:43] * dfch unzips
[00:16:45] <DaPinkOne> Satin, the left had a vision for a national identity in the 50s and 60s, but a large portion of their leadership was either killed or imprisoned
[00:16:55] <DaPinkOne> mccarthyism and the cold war really fucked us up
[00:17:02] <Satin> DaPinkOne: yeah :(
[00:17:06] <Satin> that is very true
[00:17:12] <Aurora_v_kosmose> dfch: And so Harambe left to partake in the heavenly toke
[00:17:38] <DaPinkOne> the russians/ussr believed in worker's rights and economic freedoms, so that must be unamerican
[00:17:43] <DaPinkOne> rediculous
[00:17:44] <Satin> lol
[00:18:05] <Satin> yeah :/
[00:18:23] <Satin> i know this is such a cliche thing to say
[00:18:30] <Satin> but we're probably headed towards civil war of some sort
[00:18:44] <DaPinkOne> i'm convinced that's the real roots of the contrarianism that the right wing espouses. this "owning the libs" shit is just the same as the "owning the ruskies" shit we had decades ago
[00:19:06] <Satin> DaPinkOne: i'm more ...symphathetic in my explanation I guess?
[00:19:14] <Satin> DaPinkOne: a lot of it just stems from plain ole fear.
[00:19:22] <Satin> things changing rapidly. within a genreration.
[00:19:54] <DaPinkOne> yeah, but that fear was stoked in the cold war just the same, and it was used to supplant the gains the working class had made in the 40s-60s
[00:19:55] <Satin> all the same concepts, from way of life, to gender, to the economic system associated with the national identity of this country, and bullshit like american exceptionalism, and more
[00:20:06] <Satin> and waking up to the aftermath of neoliberalism globalism
[00:20:07] <DaPinkOne> and then reagan showed up and really fucked it over the rest of the way
[00:20:14] <Satin> middle america robbed of jobs and what not
[00:20:15] <Satin> yeah
[00:20:18] <Aurora_v_kosmose> I just wish there was some country that actually was legitimately better than mine to a degree sufficient to actually justify carring.
[00:20:26] <Aurora_v_kosmose> *caring
[00:20:31] <Satin> even values and principles
[00:20:36] <Aurora_v_kosmose> But they all mostly suck, some more than others.
[00:20:41] <Satin> religion doesn't matter as much anymore
[00:20:44] <Satin> we live in a postmodern era
[00:21:03] <Satin> and somehow americans are suffering the worst of it, aren't sure about naything themselves
[00:21:19] <DaPinkOne> I hear good things about some countries, but our media is inundated with misinformation about any non-US ally, so I can't be sure
[00:21:21] <Satin> no one knows what being american means now, it's in a state of flux
[00:21:39] <DaPinkOne> figuring out reasonable accounts of wtf happened during the cold war is infuriating
[00:21:42] <Satin> but within weirdness and confusion is beauty too  
[00:21:56] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Decrepit fossils keep trying & occasionally passing idiotic surveillance bills here.
[00:22:08] <Satin> DaPinkOne: we're the world's expermimental grounds right now
[00:22:13] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Caring nothing but for profit and hegemony that won't matter when they end up killing us all in their idiotic greed.
[00:22:15] <Satin> i don't want to make us sound exceptional either
[00:22:17] <DaPinkOne> we should have an age cap on congress.
[00:22:22] <Aurora_v_kosmose> And it's the same basically everywhere.
[00:22:27] <Satin> but a lot of the cutting edge leftist movements are emerging in the US
[00:22:34] <Satin> not in europe or whatever, which is very much settled in the status quo
[00:22:38] <DaPinkOne> *we should have a cap on government positions
[00:22:39] <Satin> or other parts of the world
[00:22:54] <Satin> it turns out, in confusion and flux and change, emerge new things
[00:23:10] <Satin> i don't think european neoliberals want much to change
[00:23:21] <Satin> or have much to worry about
[00:23:37] <HeTo> I'd like to point out that neoliberalism is a right-wing idea
[00:23:51] <Satin> centre left and centre right are both neoliberal
[00:23:56] <Satin> in this day and age
[00:23:56] <DaPinkOne> Satin, we'll see. it looks like they're gonna privatise the NHS, and the UK isn't doing to great recently
[00:24:08] <Satin> DaPinkOne: the UK hasn't been doing great in general for years now yeah
[00:24:22] <Satin> DaPinkOne: it's just one datapoint, but the UK is full of feminist TERFs
[00:24:35] <DaPinkOne> HeTo, well yeah, the proper solution here is an economy without profit as it's primary motivation
[00:24:35] <Omega037> So I need to find a way to make myself seem like enough of a flight risk at work to get a retention bonus, but not enough that they assume I am going and cut me out
[00:24:38] <HeTo> I'm much more concerned about the people in the government there
[00:24:39] <Satin> while the ameircan left in general has no issue with gender identity and what not and far more progressive
[00:24:42] <HeTo> than TERFs
[00:24:50] <Aurora_v_kosmose> so yeah, when everything is mostly about pointless greed, why care?
[00:24:53] <Satin> HeTo: of course, my example was just a cultural example
[00:25:00] <Satin> Aurora_v_kosmose: not caring is bad
[00:25:05] <Satin> we live in a flawed world
[00:25:09] <Aurora_v_kosmose> And that's the best-case. Religious holdouts remain which are unambiguously worse.
[00:25:21] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Satin: I mean "why care to help or like them" when they're trying to drag us all down?
[00:25:24] <Satin> Aurora_v_kosmose: there is such a thing as making things slightly better than yesterday >:c
[00:25:40] <DaPinkOne> Aurora_v_kosmose, I'd say not caring about macro level issues is fine. get involved in your local community. help people who you can get to know
[00:26:25] <DaPinkOne> you'll care because they're your friends :>
[00:26:26] <Omega037> DaPinkOne, you can maybe do without monetary profit, but ultimately you need some reward mechanism
[00:26:39] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Local culture here is basically more interested in who fucks what than actually improving things.
[00:26:51] <Omega037> You are better off trying to make the rewards happen in a way that benefits society
[00:27:03] <DaPinkOne> Omega037, I didn't say money wasn't involved, but I don't think it should be necessary for individuals to work to survive
[00:27:07] <Satin> ^
[00:27:31] <DaPinkOne> government subsidies and services aren't unique or new ideas either.
[00:27:42] <HeTo> DaPinkOne: it is necessary for someone to work for people to survive
[00:27:42] <Aurora_v_kosmose> No one cares about the "deviants". No one cares about idiot oligarches' feelings. Fix the problems for fuck's sake.
[00:28:02] <Omega037> DaPinkOne, eh
[00:28:08] <HeTo> DaPinkOne: even the food that grows on trees needs someone to nurture the trees and collect the fruits
[00:28:17] <DaPinkOne> HeTo, perhaps, and nobody wants to do a job that needs to be done, those individuals should be adequately compensated that they do at that point desire to do the work
[00:28:17] <Omega037> I think you gotta avoid extremes
[00:28:23] <Satin> Aurora_v_kosmose: agreed
[00:28:39] <Omega037> I don't think a society where an able-bodied person doesn't have to contribute is alright
[00:28:56] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Omega037: As a working programmer, I have never contributed to society at work.
[00:28:56] <DaPinkOne> HeTo, I'm arguing the abolishing of work-to-live, not the abolishion of labor itself
[00:29:00] <Omega037> Now, what "contribute" can mean, that is another story
[00:29:08] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Omega037: I have contributed to the profit of some fuckers holding infrastructure hostage.
[00:29:15] <MootPoot> Satin: cool but pointless animation http://daniel-lundin.github.io/snabbt.js/periodic.html

[00:29:28] <DaPinkOne> MootPoot, sweet!
[00:29:29] <HeTo> DaPinkOne: adequately compensated - so, profit?
[00:29:33] <Satin> MootPoot: i've seen this somewhere before i think
[00:29:40] <Aurora_v_kosmose> I have contributed more via work done in my hobbies than I have in all my paid wage work.
[00:29:43] *** Joins: weeb (~libera@e1.nixmagic.com)
[00:29:51] <Satin> HeTo: you can be adequately compensated without living in a system that actively encourages competition between people.
[00:29:51] <dfch> oh reminds me of three.js
[00:29:52] <Omega037> At the greater scale, societal advancement may require a lot of attempts
[00:29:53] <Aurora_v_kosmose> That's a problem.
[00:29:58] <Satin> and profit between one person and another
[00:30:04] <Satin> and a competition of profit*
[00:30:10] *** Quits: aHick (~memes@143.60.229.4) (Ping timeout: 250 seconds)
[00:30:10] <Omega037> So person your company didn't advance things, but you need many companies like it for one of them to hit an advance
[00:30:11] <HeTo> like, yes, this is profit from labour rather than profit from owning the means of production, but you did not specify the latter earlier
[00:30:39] <DaPinkOne> HeTo, an individual can benefit from their labor, yes, but such a business would be run by the workers and/or government owned and run at cost, not with the objective of squeesing as much value out of the workers as possible
[00:31:02] *** Quits: a0z1 (~a0z1@cpc158779-hari22-2-0-cust168.20-2.cable.virginm.net) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[00:31:06] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Local system incentivizes contributing to government hegemony or oligarches' bottom line. Not to society.
[00:31:45] <Satin> having corporations owned by workers rather than capitalists would be such a great start
[00:31:52] <Aurora_v_kosmose> ^
[00:32:03] <HeTo> DaPinkOne: the problem with government-owned is how do you prevent those who are the government being, in practice, the owners who get most of the profit, even if nominally it's the government or the people
[00:32:09] <DaPinkOne> Satin, we could call them councils, or soviets. I swear it's never been tried before
[00:32:11] <Satin> having laws that encourage ownership of a company being transferred to workers rather than company would be such a great start too
[00:32:21] <Aurora_v_kosmose> So yeah, I always find the "contributing to society" line funny. Other than taxes, I never have via work.
[00:32:31] <Satin> Aurora_v_kosmose: very strong point there yeah
[00:32:33] <Omega037> I actually contribute to society with my work
[00:32:42] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Omega037: You're lucky.
[00:32:46] <Omega037> Which, while not required, does help one find meaning
[00:32:52] <Omega037> Not really, you can choose where to work
[00:32:53] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Omega037: For the overwhelming majority of tech work, that's not possible.
[00:32:57] <Omega037> Especially as a programmer
[00:33:07] <Omega037> Eh
[00:33:10] <Satin> I think you're wrong about that lol
[00:33:17] <DaPinkOne> HeTo, you're essentially asking how do we reign in corruption in government, and I do admit, I don't have an answer to that one
[00:33:20] <Omega037> I work in biotech/agtech
[00:33:24] <Satin> people actually jobhunting and programmers here will tell you a different story.
[00:33:31] <Aurora_v_kosmose> ^
[00:33:33] <dfch> ^^
[00:33:35] <DaPinkOne> pitchforks and guillitines?
[00:33:37] <Omega037> For the most part if you work in this space, you are at least indirectly contributing
[00:33:38] <dfch> ^_^

[00:34:07] <Aurora_v_kosmose> They were paid well too.

[00:40:44] <Omega037> Not sure if Authoritarian is the opposite of Progressive really, since Progressive *is* a statist position
[00:40:49] <DaPinkOne> most progressives live in the cities, and due to the structure of our government, their votes are worth less than those in urban areas

[00:44:02] <Satin> Omega037: that's not as clear cut as "individual benefit"
[00:44:08] <Poeticode> idk why we care so much about states when big tech already controls so many aspects of our lives

[00:44:23] <Aurora_v_kosmose> dfch: Kyoresu is great.
[00:44:28] <Omega037> Satin, that is sorta the point
[00:44:34] <Omega037> The collective does more overall good
[00:44:40] <dfch> contigo bro is great
[00:44:40] <Omega037> Otherwise, why do it at all
[00:44:54] <Omega037> But is it right to harm one person to help 50
[00:45:06] <Omega037> Or to restrict an individual's rights
[00:45:15] <Omega037> I mean, that is always the crux of the argument
[00:45:19] <Satin> yeah? 
[00:45:21] <dfch> my fav kyoresu song
[00:45:25] <Satin> you drive on the highways
[00:45:34] <DaPinkOne> Omega037, there's an implicit assumption there that restricting individual rights does not harm people
[00:45:35] <Omega037> Depends on the situation, is what reasonable people think
[00:45:49] <Omega037> Hardcore Libertarians are crazy for individual rights
[00:45:53] <Satin> no, a lot of people don't have reasonable ideas about this imo

[00:46:03] <Omega037> Hardcore Progressives are for the other

[00:46:19] <Satin> I've never seen hardcore progressives argue for the abolition of civil liberties
[00:46:20] <Satin> seriously
[00:46:35] <Omega037> Satin, sure they do
[00:46:35] <DaPinkOne> Omega037, the leftwing anarchist crowd would also be for individual rights
[00:46:50] <Aurora_v_kosmose> dfch: The puppy one is fun but not as interesting in theme.
[00:46:50] <DaPinkOne> it's possible to mix the two
[00:47:05] <Omega037> They aren't against individual rights automatically
[00:47:07] <Satin> Yeah I was about to bring that point up as well DaPinkOne 
[00:47:09] <Satin> as i mentioned earlier
[00:47:12] <Omega037> There has to be a compelling reason
[00:47:33] <Satin> there's plenty of far left leaning people that argue for the state to be very much reigned into the control of the people
[00:47:43] <Satin> but fundamentally focus on "local" solutions for things
[00:48:05] <Omega037> Honestly, most people who are politically active tend to by all for the state when it is for their ideas, and against it when opposed
[00:48:10] <DaPinkOne> ham and rice burritos for lunch
[00:48:29] <Aurora_v_kosmose> The scale of the corruption has made local solutions ineffective and attempts at scaled intervention near impossible to organize.
[00:48:30] <Omega037> So really, the issue is idealogues
[00:48:50] <Neopolitan> the issue is politicians and entrenched power VS the will of the people
[00:48:57] <Omega037> Eh
[00:49:01] <Omega037> The will of the people kinda sucks
[00:49:06] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Neopolitan: That's part of it at least.
[00:49:09] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Omega037: That's another issue.
[00:49:17] <DaPinkOne> Omega037, I've seen that the state isn't the end solution, but as a community, we don't have the class consciousness or parallel structures in place to sustain ourselves without it. there's more work that needs to be done on the ground
[00:49:18] <Omega037> Certainly it isn't good when everyone clearly wants pot legal
[00:49:20] <Omega037> And it isnt
[00:49:37] <Satin> Linking a specific timestamp
[00:49:38] <Omega037> But the "will of the people" also leads to lynch mobs

[00:49:51] <Omega037> And knee-jerk reactions to half-read headlines
[00:49:51] <DaPinkOne> until then, either we'll get the state to work for us, or it'll all burn to the ground
[00:49:58] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Drugs safer than ethanol should be legal.
[00:50:12] <Aurora_v_kosmose> It makes no sense to keep a hard drug legal but soft ones not.
[00:50:22] <dfch> heroin?
[00:50:31] <Aurora_v_kosmose> dfch: Heroin isn't typically legal.
[00:50:40] <DaPinkOne> dfch, heroin abuse is a medical and a social issue, not a criminal one. 
[00:51:11] <Aurora_v_kosmose> But few things cause as much damage as widespread ethanol abuse other than opioids.
[00:51:20] <DaPinkOne> it should be legal and treated with rehabilitative services, courtesy of the local community or state
[00:51:59] <Aurora_v_kosmose> And ease of fabrication isn't the reason. Growing psychoactive plants tends to be pretty easy when legal barriers aren't a consideration.
[00:52:14] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Even more so than building a safe distillation rig.

[01:19:40] <DaPinkOne> he didn't say anythin, so I didn't even see him show up
[01:20:36] <Satin> I'm extremely confused tbh
[01:20:47] <Satin> like
[01:20:54] <Satin> i went to find my vaccination card in the car
[01:21:09] <Satin> and i see a bunch of stuff from the center console dash compartment
[01:21:14] <Satin> strewn on the seats?
[01:21:30] <Satin> but i find my credit card there, my drivers license under the seat, and also my vaccination card?
[01:21:38] <Satin> and the coins in the center console are still there
[01:21:43] <Satin> but the wallet itself i can't find?
[01:21:46] <Satin> wtf is going on
[01:21:55] <TsundereNoises> Satin: was there cash in the wallet?
[01:21:57] <Satin> i can be slobby sometimes and do that
[01:22:02] <Satin> TsundereNoises: i don't remember lol
[01:22:05] <Satin> probably a little bit
[01:22:05] <HeTo> are the windows intact? was your car locked?
[01:22:14] <TsundereNoises> Satin: maybe they just wanted the cash and were trying to be nice
[01:22:16] <Satin> yeah i'm pretty sure the car was locked. it's my habit
[01:22:21] <Satin> and the windows are intact
[01:22:32] <MootPoot> 4okay
[01:22:36] <Satin> now i *hope* it's just me mindlessly having been a slob
[01:22:40] <MootPoot> I cant concentrate on typescript anymore
[01:22:40] <Satin> and strewn that
[01:22:43] <Satin> but i don't do that usually
[01:22:45] <MootPoot> I'm going to fap nonstop for a hour
[01:22:48] <MootPoot> then come back
[01:22:50] <Satin> i rarely do that if i'm trying to find for something
[01:22:51] <Satin> else
[01:22:54] <Satin> MootPoot: didn't ask
[01:23:00] <MootPoot> Satin: but no u know
[01:23:02] <MootPoot> ;3
[01:23:06] <DaPinkOne> MootPoot, careful of the chaffeing
[01:23:21] <MootPoot> dont worry, I can go upto 6 times in row without any problems 
[01:23:24] <HeTo> wouldn't you remember if you were trying to look for something? and remember strewing at least after you see it strewn?
[01:23:35] <Satin> HeTo: yes i most likely would
[01:23:39] <Satin> and i don't remember doing that recently
[01:23:53] <Satin> at the same time it looks like something i would have done i have to confess, if i was looking for something
[01:24:05] <Satin> so now i'm just confused by myself lmao
[01:24:12] <Satin> but one thing's for sure: i can't find the wallet
[01:24:34] <Satin> but i'm not as concerned as i should be because my short term pressure is to visit campus and get a lanyard for classes tomorrow, and i was worried about the vaccination card

[01:25:19] * Satin meows back in latin
[01:25:33] <Satin> i'm at home
[01:25:36] <Satin> and my housemates would never do such a thing
[01:25:53] <Satin> we leave our doors unlocked but we never touch each other's stuff or anything
[01:25:57] <Satin> or our doors can't be locked rather
[01:26:39] <HeTo> I hope so. and maybe you'll find your wallet wherever you left it but don't remember soon
[01:26:58] <Satin> I'll re-look again in the car once i finish this lanyard business
[01:27:15] <Satin> but i can't see anything and i rarely lose such items. they're always in the car within reach
[01:27:22] <Satin> and the other stuff is in my room always
[01:27:32] <Satin> keys, watch, phone.
[01:27:49] <Satin> now, is it a bad idea to keep the wallet in the car? yes. habit? yes.
[01:28:10] <Satin> ButterNoodle: do you keep yours in the car
[01:28:12] <Satin> TsundereNoises: 
[01:28:53] <TsundereNoises> Satin: do I keep what in the car?
[01:29:00] <Satin> the magical girl coins
[01:29:06] <ButterNoodle> woah
[01:29:06] <Satin> (the wallet)
[01:29:09] <TsundereNoises> Satin: actually, nvm, I don't keep anything but cds in the car
[01:29:10] <ButterNoodle> my wallet?
[01:29:14] <Bco1981> Satin: lol
[01:29:14] <TsundereNoises> Satin: hell the fuck no
[01:29:15] <Satin> yes
[01:29:20] <Satin> TsundereNoises: so it's just me who does that?
[01:29:21] <Satin> WTF
[01:29:23] <ButterNoodle> nope.. front left pocket
[01:29:26] <TsundereNoises> Satin: I've had my car broken into twice in my life
[01:29:31] <Satin> ufffff
[01:29:33] <ButterNoodle> my car is sterile
[01:29:48] <Satin> i'm too used to living in a suburban relatively safe area in missouri
[01:29:50] <Satin> fuck lol
[01:29:55] <ButterNoodle> I dont need to tempt anyone to break a window
[01:30:14] <Satin> welp...
[01:30:17] <TsundereNoises> Satin: anyway, wallet lives on the bookshelf nearest the door, with the car keys/house keys/etc. Vaccination card lives in the back of my desk with other paperwork kind of shit
[01:30:18] <Satin> assuming i find the wallet again
[01:30:24] <Satin> i'll try not to keep it in the car again
[01:30:29] <Satin> if i don't, well, it was taken.
[01:30:43] <TsundereNoises> Satin: worst thing about someone breaking into your car in winter: driving with saran wrap for a window
[01:30:55] <Satin> TsundereNoises: jesus christ
[01:31:08] <TsundereNoises> Satin: 10 years or so ago, but I'm still mad
[01:31:13] <Satin> lol
[01:31:14] <Satin> undertsandable
[01:31:46] <ButterNoodle> u never get all the glass out
[01:32:02] <TsundereNoises> ButterNoodle: not true, the human ass is a natural magnet for shards of glass
[01:32:14] *** Joins: Arcorann (~A@user/arcorann)
[01:32:17] <Satin> i found glass in plastic bags in my car or somehting
[01:32:18] <Satin> or wait
[01:32:22] <Satin> no it was on the ground somewhere idk
[01:32:32] <Satin> but anyways the bullets went through and shattered the back glass
[01:32:41] <HeTo> Satin: now just because your credit card is there, doesn't mean the number wasn't stolen
[01:32:42] <Satin> i still have some of the glass sitting in my car 
[01:32:47] <Satin> HeTo: oh shit u right
[01:32:57] <ButterNoodle> TsundereNoises: ur ass will always find a new one tho
[01:33:11] <TsundereNoises> ButterNoodle: true true
[01:33:28] <TsundereNoises> ButterNoodle: actually my feet are really good at that too, I swear whenever I break a glass in the house I'm hurting myself on it for months
[01:33:32] <TsundereNoises> no matter how much I sweep
[01:34:05] <HeTo> although, if there are no signs of the car having been broken in, I don't know if theft is the most probable explanation here
[01:34:09] <DaPinkOne> gotta use a vacuum and a good flashlight. the glass is hard to see, and the broom always misses some
[01:38:24] <Satin> TsundereNoises: that's so comical
[01:38:31] <Satin> i'm sorry for laughing at your expense
[01:38:41] <TsundereNoises> Satin: it's okay, you're not alone

[02:14:57] <Bco1981> the mpv config uses the gpu instead of standard cpu.
[02:15:38] <DaPinkOne> the nural network ones look the best, unsurprisingly
[02:16:04] <DaPinkOne> Image Tracing looks sharp for text upscale though
[02:16:33] <JesseDesu> gpu uses more power.  more power takes more from the power plant.  the power plant has to burn more coal or gas, which goes into the atmosphere and contributes to global warming
[02:17:16] <JesseDesu> see the connection
[02:17:21] <Bco1981> the power plant burns the same, i just makes sure it is not burned in vain.
[02:17:22] <DaPinkOne> JesseDesu, maybe. GPU is also more apt at threading and concurrency, meaning things may be able to get done before things heat up
[02:17:27] <JesseDesu> anime upscaling ruins the earth
[02:17:56] <JesseDesu> if everyone upscaled their anime
[02:18:07] <DaPinkOne> if you're arguing upscaling is bad for the environment, sure it is
[02:18:11] <JesseDesu> yes
[02:18:17] <JesseDesu> that is exactly what i'm saying

[04:09:38] <Aurora_v_kosmose> That doesn't work particularly well. Tentacles are more comparable to tongues or fingers anyway. Both in function and mechanism.
[04:13:07] <TsundereNoises> Aurora_v_kosmose: that's true if we're talking sea life, but it's a well-known fact that most tentacle monster tentacles are penises
[04:14:24] <TsundereNoises> obviously finger-tentacles are inherently non-discriminatory, a monster of any sex can and will molest anyone with them
[04:15:16] <Aurora_v_kosmose> I think even for octopi one just doubles as a sexual organ.

[05:55:04] <MootPoot> I need to replace my monitor cable
[05:55:10] <MootPoot> I think that's why it is flickering
[05:55:23] <JesseDesu> you need to kick it
[05:55:29] <JesseDesu> hard
[05:55:36] <MootPoot> I'm not kicking a 1000 dollar monitor
[05:55:53] <JesseDesu> thats how spike spiegel does things
[05:56:25] <JesseDesu> is it under warranty
[05:56:31] <JesseDesu> did you buy a warranty
[05:56:33] <amigojapan> Spike Spiegel also is always broke
[05:56:49] <JesseDesu> he 12,12dies at the end
[05:56:51] <MootPoot> no warrenty - no option either
[05:56:57] <MootPoot> but I'm fairly sure its the cable
[05:57:05] <JesseDesu> thats wishful
[05:57:10] <amigojapan> I know Jesse
[05:57:14] <MootPoot> since if it was the monitor windows would no longer detect the monitor and rearrange all my windows
[05:57:18] <JesseDesu> what if its a blown capacitor
[05:57:29] <MootPoot> all that is happening is that it changes to black and back 
[05:57:33] <JesseDesu> you still configuring arch
[05:57:36] <MootPoot> every min or two for a second
[05:57:40] <MootPoot> no, arch is done
[05:57:46] <JesseDesu> good
[05:57:55] <MootPoot> I'm not going to put any high end stuff on arch
[05:57:56] <JesseDesu> arch is something yuou do just to say you did it
[05:58:01] <MootPoot> no
[05:58:06] <MootPoot> I use that system regularly
[05:58:16] <JesseDesu> no sensible person would use arch for a production machine
[05:58:26] <MootPoot> buts its not a production machine
[05:58:29] <MootPoot> its a home machine
[05:58:36] <JesseDesu> you aint making cool shit
[05:58:56] <JesseDesu> and relying on it for business
[05:59:05] <MootPoot> no
[05:59:11] <MootPoot> if I did that I would do it on windows
[05:59:13] <MootPoot> not linux
[05:59:20] <JesseDesu> yes windows is a sensible production OS
[05:59:39] <amigojapan> Man bad opinions today
[05:59:40] <JesseDesu> ubuntu is the windows of linux
[06:00:04] <PancakeMatsuri> I've seen some Ubuntu prod
[06:00:11] <MootPoot> why would I try to make and sell something for linux - a smaller market with less people to buy my stuff
[06:00:45] <PancakeMatsuri> SaaS has all the OS as market
[06:00:52] <MootPoot> if it was some high end enterprise tool then sure, but that's not the case with anything I'm going to be building
[06:02:06] <amigojapan> MootPoot: you could use a multiplatform developing system like Qt and still sell it on Windows
[06:02:32] <PancakeMatsuri> or a webapp
[06:02:35] <MootPoot> sure, but then I'd have to support the linux market
[06:02:37] <PancakeMatsuri> or Electron
[06:02:56] <MootPoot> which would be a pain - for a tiny amount of users I would have to dedicate equal if not more developement time
[06:03:02] <MootPoot> and support time
[06:03:18] <MootPoot> if its a webapp then sure, anything goes really

[06:06:17] <amigojapan> MootPoot: and if you use multiplatform you could also support Mac which is huge now
[06:06:37] <MootPoot> Sure, but if I wanted to do multiplatform I would just do a webapp 
[06:06:55] <amigojapan> Web apps are limited
[06:07:08] <amigojapan> You can't do everything with them
[06:07:10] <MootPoot> And if I wanted to do windows I would use something like. NET which has better integration with windows 
[06:07:40] <amigojapan> MootPoot: then you would not have a Mac version

[06:36:03] <JesseDesu> i'm not into moving models
[06:36:06] <JesseDesu> only static ones
[06:36:18] <S_T_A_N> bite my pink purple and orange dickbagel 
[06:36:22] <JesseDesu> the instant it moves or lights up it becomes something like a toy
[06:36:51] <JesseDesu> theres toys and theres works of art
[06:37:02] <gh0s1> Yeah, these were toys :)
[06:37:08] <JesseDesu> i mean
[06:37:10] <gh0s1> There were competitions etc
[06:37:13] <JesseDesu> i did do model rockets
[06:37:18] <gh0s1> Hell yeah
[06:37:24] <JesseDesu> when i was in 4th grade
[06:37:40] <JesseDesu> but after launching 5 of them the novelty wore off

[06:38:47] <JesseDesu> i like static models that look like the real thing in every detail
[06:39:04] <JesseDesu> i fly them in my mind

[06:40:01] <JesseDesu> pictures of flying RC models arent as impressive as 1/48 or 1/32 scale static models
[06:40:07] <JesseDesu> thats imo
[06:40:23] <JesseDesu> i'm so picky
[06:40:38] <amigojapan> I see Jesse
[06:40:39] <JesseDesu> if i wawnted to really fly or do something like flying i'd pickup flight simulators
[06:40:42] <JesseDesu> which i did for a time
[06:41:14] <amigojapan> Jesse I have used a flight simulator for RC planes
[06:41:27] <JesseDesu> ive heard of that
[06:41:37] <JesseDesu> i went to a hobby store that had a demo for helecopters

[08:28:56] <TsundereNoises> the sleeping at the desk thing is a previous thing, not right now

[08:30:11] <amigojapan> Never happened to me

[08:34:00] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: I never have, I've been close sometimes, but stopping to get out has always been enough to get me home

[16:27:20] <Satin> yes im stressed in general and have untreated ptsd from the shooting
[16:27:45] <Satin> first day of the semester today, i just hope i can settle into a comfortable rhythm
[16:27:52] <mexen> oh sorry, I didn't know. It must be tough, are you on your own?

[16:28:44] <Satin> i was in the ICU at this time a year ago for a month for taking in 5 bullets from carjackers etc

[16:29:12] * ImoutoBot welcomes s​mallville7123 (2 / 2): <s​mallville7123> Imouto committed seppuku
[16:29:26] <mexen> oh goodness me, that's dreadful. Glad you made it
[16:29:31] <mexen> Well for me...
[16:29:46] <mexen> I reset my cycle by disrupting a routine
[16:30:02] <Satin> disrupting?
[16:30:17] <Satin> lol my phone just went from night mode to bluelight mode
[16:30:26] <mexen> Yeah let me give an example
[16:30:26] <Satin> good morning!
[16:32:26] <mexen> I used to wake up at 4 no matter what, I would be in bed by midnight after like 2 hours of being in front of screen. So I traded those hours for just laying in the dark. Soon enough I was going to bed at 10pm and waking up at 4am does not feel as draining anymore
[16:33:00] <Satin> So nothing at all whatsoever?
[16:33:07] <Satin> digital devices*
[16:33:08] <mexen> sometimes I would just stare at the ceiling for an hour, hour and half...now by 9:30pm, I get sleepy
[16:33:16] <Satin> Doesn't that get a bit boring?
[16:33:25] <Satin> or was it for a short time and then you didn't need to do it a few days later?
[16:33:26] <mexen> Ok when I first started, I traded my phone for my kindle
[16:33:46] <Satin> Oh dude. I could start reading the literature novels I want to get through, every night before bed.
[16:33:48] <Satin> Ya think that would help?
[16:34:23] <mexen> Yes, I really do. Reading before bed (e-ink or paperback) has been helpful for me so I recommend it
[16:34:31] <mexen> Not your phone, ipad or whatever
[16:34:44] <Satin> Yeah. I have and prefer physical books
[16:34:53] <mexen> Put that stuff away 30 minutes before you settle in
[16:35:13] <Satin> I just didn't think of doing that. That's such a great idea honestly. I've already wanted to minimize digital device usage wherever I can and have more reflective/focused moments on books and such.
[16:35:17] <Satin> Two birds in one stone
[16:35:28] <mexen> Awesome!
[16:35:42] <Satin> Spend an hour or two reading after I finish schoolwork, I'll try that tonight
[16:35:56] <Publios> !
[16:36:17] <DPA> Once again, I'm looking for ideas for animes to watch. But I'm not sure what I'm looking for. It should be more fantasy than realism. Maybe something that explores an unique idea. No boring romance / slice of life stuff. No mecha stuff. Fighting shouldn't be the main focus.
[16:36:17] <DPA> But there should still be interesting new developments. Interesting characters are a plus. And no "someone evil pulls strings in the background" trope. (that holds suspense, but tends not to deliver on it).

[16:57:16] <Satin> It has philosophy references, thinkers, and so on. It's a lot of interesting stuff, mixed with a fascinating storyline. It's seriously worth analyzing a 'lil like Neon Genesis Evangelion.
[16:57:44] <Satin> Obviously you don't have to be caught into all of that. It's just.. for the most part aside from boring fillers in the middle, one of the best anime I've seen.
[16:57:51] <Miyukii> Some parts of it seem a little out there, like the quiz episode
[16:58:15] <Satin> that's exactly what i was thinking of when I said filler episodes
[16:58:26] <Satin> there's also the one with the camp that seemed a bit unnecessary but yeah
[16:58:33] <Satin> kind of typical for its day and age
[16:59:12] <Miyukii> The filler is one thing, but what I meant is that it seemed a bit disconnected from the rest of the series
[17:03:50] <Satin> Sometimes.

[18:09:00] <ButterNoodle> :|
[18:09:04] <Bco1981> 2 or more
[18:09:17] <ButterNoodle> they made so many different variations of that switch..

[18:11:23] <Bco1981> i was more thinking of with only 1 pair, like 1 patch cable, i can have a 10g connection on each side of the fiber patch cables, cable. then do the anime trick and combine them on the switches.

[18:12:44] <ButterNoodle> tf
[18:12:52] <Bco1981> so in short, i only need to pull 1 fiber cable, but it will be 2 connections. but onw the switches it can become 1

[19:06:21] <Sadale> ButterNoodle, what did you mean by dead tube?
[19:06:31] * dfch is just really really dumb tho
[19:06:32] <ButterNoodle> its a manga
[19:06:37] <ButterNoodle> maybe that was saganman

[19:06:53] <ButterNoodle> it was now that I remember
[19:07:03] <ButterNoodle> Sadale: gud shit if u like brutal stuff
[19:07:15] <Sadale> Brutal? no thanks.
[19:07:20] <ButterNoodle> :|
[19:07:33] <ButterNoodle> cute girls killing each other
[19:07:41] <Sadale> dfch, what's even is the point of measuring CO2 at home?
[19:07:56] <ButterNoodle> I have CO sensors
[19:07:58] <Sadale> Let's say, if it's of high value, is there even anything you could do with that?
[19:08:01] <ButterNoodle> not co2
[19:08:05] <ButterNoodle> Sadale: open a window
[19:08:22] <dfch> Sadale, for managing optimal air quality obviously
[19:08:22] <Sadale> oh duh!
[19:08:26] <ButterNoodle> u can get high as fuck on O2
[19:08:35] <ButterNoodle> just get an o2 tank
[19:09:05] <Sadale> dfch, how do you manage that tho? If the CO2 level is high even after opening the windows, what'd you do?
[19:09:07] <Sadale> cry?
[19:09:11] <ButterNoodle> there is a point of super saturation in the body.. and then everything is "loud"
[19:09:38] <ButterNoodle> like everything feels like it burns relatively
[19:10:10] <dfch> Sadale, well obviously there're limitations, but opening/closing windows or starting turning off ac can level down co2 to outside levels
[19:10:29] <ButterNoodle> ac increases co2?
[19:10:30] <Sadale> I see :3
[19:10:51] <ButterNoodle> mr wizzard pls explain.. or I just google
[19:11:01] <Sadale> I think AC doesn't increase CO2 per se. But if you keep exhalting CO2 in a closed space, then yes. CO2 would rise...? I guess.
[19:11:37] <ButterNoodle> running air across cold metal.. it condenses out moisture.. so something science-ey is happening
[19:12:27] <ButterNoodle> wonder how much co2 my 30 cats output
[19:12:35] <Sadale> lol
[19:12:38] <dfch> ButterNoodle get a co2 sensor!
[19:12:42] <Sadale> did you ever bang your cat girls? :3
[19:12:57] <Sadale> dfch, sell your CO2 monitoring solution to ButterNoodle! :LP
[19:12:58] <ButterNoodle> Sadale: if I had cat girls I would have no need for this place
[19:13:08] <Sadale> ButterNoodle, ouch!
[19:13:08] <ButterNoodle> oh oh oh oh

[20:42:16] <sentionics> my family members are ok, that said. My dad is back to work, and my cousin, last I spoke with him, is just dealing with some lesser symptoms (he's getting better).

[20:43:45] <sentionics> I dread my next booster shot (I guess that'll be some time in July or whatever). At this point, I think it's established that a covid booster == flu-ish symptoms for almost 2 days
[20:44:36] <sentionics> Urchin[emacs], nice! Your music taste, my music taste, they are synchronized!
[20:44:55] <sentionics> also, I love her shirt being open like that. :P

[20:46:12] <sentionics> MootPoot, if you get side effects, no worries, it's only for a short time (>_>)
[20:46:48] <sentionics> from my understanding, side effects shouldn't drag on too long.
[20:47:16] <sentionics> my 2nd shot, I was sick for a day. My booster, I was sick for a day and a half.
[20:47:53] <sentionics> Of course, I drink a lot, so maybe I'm not at my best anyway, so that might be the reason I took a bit longer.

[20:50:01] <TsundereNoises> hey senti
[20:50:07] <jbwncster> I found a strange manga
[20:50:08] <sentionics> o/
[20:50:08] <MootPoot> I have some of those problems - green flashes and screen to black and according to what he says - it might be the DP cable 
[20:50:31] <MootPoot> googled it - seems like the DP cable that came with my monitor is kind of iffy for other people as well
[20:50:44] <jbwncster> MootPoot: MacBook?
[20:50:52] <MootPoot> ?
[20:51:03] <jbwncster> Display ports are usually on a Mac
[20:51:13] <jbwncster> My windows machine has hdmi
[20:51:16] <MootPoot> I guess, sure
[20:51:32] <MootPoot> any non shit gpu on a normal PC will have DP sure
[20:51:35] <MootPoot> as well*
[20:51:41] <jbwncster> Oh well I’m on a laptop
[20:51:42] <TsundereNoises> I thought Poot had a double penetration cable

[20:53:34] <MootPoot> but I'm absolutely maxing out the throughput of the cable / DP standard with this display so I guess that is it - the cable is the problem

[20:54:04] <MootPoot> sure np
[20:54:13] <Poeticode> I'm seeing even boomers start to use tiktok and it makes me sad
[20:54:24] <MootPoot> Poeticode: why?
[20:54:31] <TsundereNoises> jbwncster: so when is the Vag Fight Island spinoff coming out?
[20:54:35] <MootPoot> if the boomers are on there that means tiktok will die

[20:54:48] <MootPoot> as the zoomers leave in droves because their parents are on there as well
[20:54:51] <MootPoot> see - facebook
[20:54:54] <TsundereNoises> MootPoot: that's what they said about facebook
[20:55:14] <Poeticode> MootPoot why are they starting to use it, or why it makes me sad?
[20:55:18] <TsundereNoises> MootPoot: yes but I still have people trying to force me onto facebook to see when their motherfucking business hours are now
[20:56:12] <Poeticode> TsundereNoises yessss that pisses me off. I have to rely on Apple/Google Maps to see business hours these days
[20:56:39] <MootPoot> I mean they dont really make you log in
[20:56:48] <Poeticode> yes they do
[20:56:56] <TsundereNoises> MootPoot: facebook nags you to, and won't let you see some stuff
[20:57:00] <MootPoot> google maps dosen't - not sure about apple
[20:57:07] <Poeticode> If I try to access a business page on FB a modal pops up asking that you log in
[20:57:10] <MootPoot> facebook is cringe
[20:57:19] <TsundereNoises> at least here, google maps has the wrong hours for everything
[20:57:26] <TsundereNoises> like they haven't updated hours in 2 years, and everyone changed them
[20:57:29] <MootPoot> google maps is mostly right here
[20:57:49] <Poeticode> hm might be cuz I'm in a little city that it's more accurate
[20:57:57] <TsundereNoises> but also fuck google and apple
[20:58:10] <TsundereNoises> what happened to just having a shitty website you had your high school kid make for you
[20:58:21] <MootPoot> I'd really rather not go to those shitty sites
[20:58:26] <TsundereNoises> why not?
[20:58:36] <TsundereNoises> picture of the business, hours, menu if restaraunt
[20:58:45] <TsundereNoises> don't need a ton of jscript and all that
[20:58:47] <MootPoot> they are worse, have less info, dont have a nice map , get updated even less then google maps - I could go on
[20:59:06] <MootPoot> aside from tracking and local resources they are worse in every other possible way
[20:59:08] <TsundereNoises> MootPoot: all the ones I'm thinking of were easier to navigate and more informative than the fucking facebook pages are
[20:59:23] <MootPoot> well I'm comparing them to gmaps , not fuckbook
[20:59:25] <TsundereNoises> and I don't need maps
[20:59:32] <TsundereNoises> that's what actually using the map is for
[20:59:33] <MootPoot> no businesses here use fuckbook afaik
[20:59:36] <TsundereNoises> you use the embedded maps?
[20:59:49] <TsundereNoises> MootPoot: it's the gold standard here
[20:59:55] <Poeticode> everyone uses it here
[21:00:00] <TsundereNoises> all businesses want you to follow them on facebook to get any info about them
[21:00:01] <MootPoot> me - I typically dont even use their business website
[21:00:10] <MootPoot> I'll just directly look them up on Gmaps
[21:00:18] <MootPoot> if they aren't  on maps - I wont go to them
[21:00:41] <jbwncster> Hillary duff has a new tv show
[21:01:16] <TsundereNoises> who is hillary duff and why do we care?
[21:01:23] <Poeticode> I have to zoom in all the way to see smaller businesses on any of the map apps
[21:01:40] <Poeticode> or maybe they're not paying premium for visibility
[21:01:41] <TsundereNoises> also generally I know where businesses are if I want their hours

[22:19:50] <ImoutoBot> [title] Keystroke Deanonymization - Whonix
[22:20:04] <Jigsy> I've never used Tor.
[22:20:07] <Jigsy> Probably time I learnt how.
[22:21:37] <ButterNoodle> why
[22:22:08] <ButterNoodle> just put a proxy on Jigsy's pc so ur browsing history is all on him
[22:22:49] <Fenderbassist> rofl
[22:22:57] <Fenderbassist> greetings evil Sir ButterNoodle :)
[22:25:26] <Jigsy> Sadly I don't have a spare machine, so I can't play around with Whonix.
[22:25:31] <Jigsy> My old laptop blew up at the end of October.
[22:25:35] <MootPoot> whorenix
[22:25:51] <MootPoot> ButterNoodle: these macros are working wonders
[22:25:55] <Fenderbassist> sorry to hear about the broken machine
[22:26:02] <MootPoot> but it seems like I'm losing weight faster then the math says I should
[22:26:10] <MootPoot> I dont understand why
[22:26:46] <MootPoot> maybe its just the combo of regular beat saber plus keto
[22:26:48] <Jigsy> Well, the machine itself still works.
[22:26:52] <Jigsy> It's just the PSU exploded.
[22:26:58] <Jigsy> So there's no way to charge it/use it.
[22:26:59] <Fenderbassist> ah
[22:28:50] <MootPoot> wym psu?
[22:28:55] <MootPoot> the external power brick?
[22:29:01] *** Quits: TsundereNoises (~Adium@024-177-252-106.res.spectrum.com) (Quit: Leaving.)
[22:29:01] <Fenderbassist> or the internal port?
[22:29:14] <MootPoot> you can just replace the external one -  they aren't too expensive
[22:29:24] <Jigsy> They don't make them for this model anymore.
[22:29:32] <Jigsy> This laptop itself is 13y old.
[22:29:43] <MootPoot> sure, but you can get equivalent replacements or a universal adapter
[22:29:53] <MootPoot> just make sure you dont mess up the voltage toggle
[22:30:29] <ButterNoodle> get a chinese one that has dirty enough filtering that the noise it makes can be picked up back in China 
[22:30:49] <MootPoot> lol the psu I got for my atomic pi borked itself
[22:30:53] <MootPoot> reuturned it
[22:33:02] <Fenderbassist> did it fry the pi?
[22:33:15] <MootPoot> nah
[22:33:19] <MootPoot> just the psu
[22:33:20] <Fenderbassist> I assume Atomic Pi = one based on an Atom processor?
[22:33:24] <MootPoot> ye
[22:33:24] <Fenderbassist> ah that's good news
[22:33:28] <Fenderbassist> cool
[22:33:40] <Fenderbassist> I have two RPis, I enjoy playing around with them
[22:33:46] <MootPoot> although Jigsy for a computer that old you can probably outperform it with a rpi for the same price as a new power adapter really
[22:34:56] <Fenderbassist> it's $100 for the RPi 400 kit, I think?
[22:35:05] <Fenderbassist> that's the one that's inside the keyboard
[22:35:07] <MootPoot> meh, just get the board

[22:36:12] <Jigsy> Pretty sure I can't run Whonix out of a VM on Pi, though.
[22:36:40] <MootPoot> or well - x86 mini PC's can be had for like 150 and up
[22:36:51] <MootPoot> with quad core celerons and 128gb ssds
[22:37:26] <Fenderbassist> Jigsy: I'm not sure if Whonix is worth your time, I've never tried it, just someone linked it in another chat so I shared
[22:37:47] <Jigsy> Why?
[22:38:26] <Fenderbassist> I didn't intend for it to determine your next purchase, unless that is what you really want to do
[22:38:28] <Fenderbassist> :)
[22:39:53] <Jigsy> ?

[23:10:11] <emmeka> Canadian farmworkers get a better deal than US ones
[23:10:24] <emmeka> in that we don't just have a broken system which treats them all as illegals
[23:10:24] <paine> well that's kind of a given, US doesn't like immigrants at all
[23:10:50] <TsundereNoises> paine: you guys really should have built a wall to keep people like me out
[23:11:02] <paine> but trump was supposed to fund the wall
[23:11:02] <MootPoot> I mean all things considered
[23:11:11] <MootPoot> the US is one of the easiest places to move to
[23:11:19] <emmeka> farmworkers come here under specific farmworker visas. they come in spring, and can stay 6 months, and it's not like anyone in Honduras or Guatemala or wherever reaaaally wants to stick through a Canadian winter.
[23:11:19] <paine> not if you're canadian
[23:11:23] <MootPoot> they dont like immigrants on a social level but 
[23:11:31] <MootPoot> on a actual numbers of immigrants level
[23:11:40] <paine> you can get a green card to USA but canadians are exempt from the program
[23:11:49] <emmeka> you don't need a green card.
[23:11:57] <TsundereNoises> MootPoot: often at risk of having basic human rights violated
[23:12:06] <paine> you have six months to stay in america as a canadian 
[23:12:10] <emmeka> also, what, no
[23:12:11] <MootPoot> emmeka: for a guy who can't enter the US you know a lot about it
[23:12:17] <emmeka> Canadian citizens can indeed get a green card

[23:13:15] <emmeka> paine this is false. it's actually trivial to move to the US.
[23:13:24] <paine> if you want to enter illegally...
[23:13:29] <emmeka> no.
[23:13:42] <TsundereNoises> it really isn't hard for canadians if it's for tourist reasons
[23:13:48] <TsundereNoises> likewise, I can just drive to canada
[23:13:51] <paine> yeah because they can enter for six months
[23:13:52] <TsundereNoises> legally
[23:14:16] <paine> canada/usa have an agreement wherein canadians/americans can legally enter either country for up to six months for visitor reasons
[23:14:25] <emmeka> you go there for the allowed 6 months, you find work in that period of time, then you get a visa. Canadians get special work visas which are easy to obtain. Then you can stay, insofar as you are employed. 
[23:14:37] <Jigsy> [19:34:53] <MootPoot> do you have a degree?
[23:14:37] <Jigsy> No.
[23:14:50] <emmeka> paine then, you can indeed get a green card if you so please
[23:14:56] <emmeka> or go the more normal route: marry a yank
[23:14:57] <paine> that seems like an interesting loophole, to obtain an a work visa from inside
[23:15:04] <paine> but you can't do the green card lottery route,
[23:15:07] <emmeka> it's not really a loophole...
[23:15:09] <paine> that i'm sure of
[23:15:20] <emmeka> you also don't need to go through the lottery route to get a green card
[23:15:28] <paine> not if you can just apply from inside
[23:15:34] <TsundereNoises> exactly
[23:15:41] <paine> in canada you are technically not supposed to enter to visit and then look for work
[23:15:47] <paine> that's misreprensentation
[23:15:50] <MootPoot> pretty sure if I crossed the US border they would just shoot me right there
[23:16:11] <TsundereNoises> MootPoot: being assaulted by a border guard is a crime in the US
[23:16:16] <paine> i haven't crossed the border recently but the last time i did i accidentally brought marijuanas back with me to canada and i think i might be on a list with america now
[23:16:16] <TsundereNoises> MootPoot: be careful
[23:16:33] <paine> i thought i smoked it all 
[23:16:40] <paine> they confiscated it but left me a pot brownie

[23:17:08] <emmeka> paine no, you're allowed to do whatever on a visitor's visas.
[23:17:11] <MootPoot> TsundereNoises: its not assault if they shoot me
[23:17:13] <emmeka> you just can't *work*
[23:17:13] <MootPoot> instead of punching
[23:17:20] <emmeka> you can *find* a job
[23:17:21] <paine> yeah because that's not what a visitor's visa is
[23:17:32] <paine> you'd have to apply for a work visa to give you the right to work
[23:17:43] <Jigsy> [19:45:50] <MootPoot> pretty sure if I crossed the US border they would just shoot me right there
[23:17:47] <Jigsy> Canadians? I doubt it.
[23:17:50] <TsundereNoises> MootPoot: if they shoot you and you don't go down right away, that counts as resisting arrest
[23:18:01] <paine> wtf is that true
[23:18:02] <Jigsy> They'd probably fire off a very polite verbal warning.
[23:18:06] <MootPoot> TsundereNoises: what if they shoot me then I shoot myself first
[23:18:09] <paine> that would explain a lot about why americans are shot so much
[23:18:18] <Omega037> I might go to Canada this summer
[23:18:22] <TsundereNoises> paine: resisting arrest is basically whatever the cops say it is
[23:18:28] <TsundereNoises> and it's a felony
[23:18:36] <Omega037> It's our 10 year anniversary, and we honeymooned in Ottawa

[23:18:39] <TsundereNoises> among other things
[23:18:40] <Omega037> Would be fun to go back
[23:18:41] <emmeka> searching for employment is an entirely legitimate use of the visitor's visa, and it doesn't matter anyway, because your visitor's visa is automatic and the intent of your visit isn't something that they have any limits on.
[23:18:53] <ButterNoodle> *stop resisting

[23:19:24] <TsundereNoises> ButterNoodle: if you don't stop resisting I'm going to fear for my life
[23:19:28] <HeTo> TsundereNoises: just because pot is legal where you live does not mean it's legal to cross borders with it, or that it's federally legal
[23:19:36] <MootPoot> "there is no reason for you to have any sort of interaction with the cops - the only thing they CAN do to you is negative"
[23:19:44] <ButterNoodle> still a federal crime
[23:19:50] <paine> do you have dual citizenship?
[23:19:51] <ButterNoodle> states rights tho
[23:20:12] <MootPoot> ButterNoodle: stalin said that every man would get a wife, a loli, a cow and a rifle
[23:20:20] <emmeka> MootPoot my mama told me when I was just a kiddo, "the cops are not your friends, and you should never ever talk to them"
[23:20:24] <TsundereNoises> MootPoot: what do you need the cow for?

[23:23:36] <MootPoot> TsundereNoises: native windows... too hard to wait for lighting to make glass
[23:23:57] <emmeka> I used to say I was métis when people asked just because it's easier than explaining it, but then one time I did this an an actual métis person got mad at me for CULTURAL APPROPRIATION
[23:24:17] <emmeka> so now I just explain that I'm half-blood like it's a Harry Potter novel
[23:24:22] <TsundereNoises> emmeka: stop being a colonizer, jeez
[23:24:37] <emmeka> I can't help it, it's a part of my heritage afterall
[23:24:38] <MootPoot> wait, if you are a half blood does that still count you as native
[23:24:44] <MootPoot> in the treaty and govt things
[23:24:48] <emmeka> MootPoot generally.
[23:24:52] <Bco1981> EdgyMC_69: only thing i have encountered was hyperv is enabled by standard... and that messed up the performance for my virtualbox's
[23:24:58] <ezekielnoob> cuties
[23:25:03] <MootPoot> emmeka: how far do you have to go down to not be counted as native
[23:25:04] <MootPoot> 1/4?
[23:25:08] <EdgyMC_69> okay, thank you Bco1981
[23:25:19] <Jigsy> There's no such thing as Cultural Appropriation.
[23:25:32] <Jigsy> Unless you're a racist idiot who has a hard-on for Apartheid.
[23:25:49] <emmeka> MootPoot it varies a bit based on what we're talking about, for example Jay Treaty rights only apply to half-bloods and up, but Indian status can be claimed by anyone at least a quarter blood. With... some difficulties.
[23:26:02] <emmeka> the law says that this can only be passed patrilineally
[23:26:28] <TsundereNoises> wtf
[23:26:42] <emmeka> yes well they've set about correcting this in recent times
[23:26:47] <paine> i would never try to claim it i look very white
[23:26:56] <paine> i am probably 1/4
[23:27:12] <emmeka> but the problem is because of the many many many decades in which mothers couldn't pass status to their children, it can be difficult to prove matrilineal treaty rights
[23:27:24] <MootPoot> are there any records of that?
[23:27:35] <MootPoot> family records going back that far

[23:31:18] <emmeka> <Jigsy> There's no such thing as Cultural Appropriation. -- as an Englishman, basically the number one offender in the world for cultural appropriation, you should maybe recuse yourself :P

[23:31:43] <Jigsy> No.

[23:33:14] <TsundereNoises> yeah, in recent times cultural appropriation is looking a lot more like a weapon to silence people you don't like, compared to "maybe white people shouldn't wear blackface"
[23:33:45] <MootPoot> nobody cares if you have some indian curry, but imo cultural appropriation is like taking westernized indian curry and putting it on national TV as "authentic indian curry"
