[00:13:27] <PanickedKernel> Hey all. I'm trying to figure out why dmesg output is flooded with these errors: https://paste.debian.net/1224237/ . Related info: debian 11 x64 and I believe these issues are related to docker and/or qemu/kvm/libvirt. My ethernet device is: enp2s0 BUT I use a bridge for qemu which is br0
[00:14:48] <PanickedKernel> There are also these errors in syslog https://paste.debian.net/1224238/

[00:25:44] <programmerq> PanickedKernel▸ the "stream copy error: reading from a closed fifo" sounds similar to an issue that I believe needed to be fixed in runc or containerd. double check you have updated versions of docker, containerd and runc.
[00:26:30] <PanickedKernel> programmerq, I'm using the official docker repo and updated everything last night. Things should be up to date.
[00:26:50] <programmerq> still worth double checking actual versions that you are running.
[00:28:04] <PanickedKernel> programmerq, For sure. I'll check now.
[00:30:07] <PanickedKernel> Hmm https://docs.docker.com/engine/release-notes/ lists 20.10.11 as latest, but docker version shows 20.10.12
[00:30:23] <programmerq> as for the sky2 errors in your dmesg, that sounds like a non-docker issue since docker just sets up virtual interfaces and a linux bridge that isn't connected to your enp2s0 device. docker just does NAT out. on my qemu-kvm guests, I use the intel or virtio devices. I'm not sure I've seen a marvell chipset for a qemu guest network card?
[00:30:54] <PanickedKernel> programmerq, I asked in #debian as well. Turns out that nic and kernel driver are crap. 
[00:31:16] <programmerq> PanickedKernel▸ it's possible the docs are pushed slightly after a release. I wouldn't worry about that one patch release of docker itself. Sometimes you can end up with a distro-provided containerd or runc package that aren't very recent.

[00:31:39] <PanickedKernel> Ahh. I added the repo from dockers website
[00:31:52] <programmerq> still, double check the actual versions of containerd and runc you are using
[00:32:15] <programmerq> don't just assume that the steps you followed achieved the desired outcome. verify.
[00:35:22] <PanickedKernel> Hmm, is containerd not a part of docker and made by docker?(I'm a docker noob still, not familiar with all the moving parts)
[00:35:42] <programmerq> check the version of the package that is actually on your system.
[00:36:17] <PanickedKernel> dpkg shows 1.4.12-1

[03:00:22] <foul_owl> about 20% of the time perhaps. Does docker really have to download an image every time it runs? Is there some sort of cache I can set for 1 year expiration?
[03:04:36] <rawtaz> foul_owl: try to first pull that image once and for all, `docker pull image/name`
[03:04:46] <rawtaz> if that works, you should be able to run it without it being pulled again
[03:04:54] <foul_owl> Gotcha! Thank you!

[11:55:41] <maret> how to easily access and copy / download a file from docker managed volume used by a docker container running on remote(aws) to local mac ?  i can use docker cp to copy on the host and then download from there but good god thats seems anoying for common access.  I am using vs code which can access remote host easily although might bit trickier then to access docker running on remote
[12:01:00] <fearnothing> hmm, to be fair about my docker situation, while my image may be 1.89GB, partly that will be down to the base image I'm working from being 944 MB already
[12:01:56] <fearnothing> and one of the things I'm adding is Chrome
[12:02:23] <fearnothing> with all the fonts

[22:58:01] <LiENUS> @fearnothing, but this isnt even querying for version numbers, it's looking at file names.
[22:59:15] <fearnothing> oh I misunderstood, I thought you said the file names included version numbers
[23:01:04] <LiENUS> the file names do
[23:01:33] <fearnothing> it's quite likely that's what the scanner's looking at then
[23:02:03] <fearnothing> you said the files were renamed to match the old versions?
[23:02:07] <LiENUS> i would have thought it would look at resource strings
[23:02:07] <LiENUS> yeah
[23:02:32] <fearnothing> not very likely. Scanners are dumb
[23:03:02] *** Quits: Ryu945 (Ryu945@gateway/vpn/protonvpn/ryu945) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[23:03:19] <LiENUS> its launched with -jar so just putting the new files in and deleting the old doesn't work. it wont find them in its classpath, i'll have to look at messing around with classpath then
[23:03:29] <LiENUS> javas not my thing
[23:04:31] *** Quits: lithium (~lithium@user/lithium) (Quit: Textual IRC Client: www.textualapp.com)
[23:04:35] <LiENUS> the renaming is given as a workaround to use older versions that support older hardware
[23:04:58] <fearnothing> that's fair
[23:05:41] <fearnothing> for a situation like that, you simply have to note that the scanner is invalid, and document the fact that you fixed things by renaming the patched version to match old filenames
[23:05:56] <fearnothing> honestly you can't really do much else
[23:05:58] <LiENUS> but like manifest.mf has the version so i assumed the scanner would be looking at that
[23:06:20] <fearnothing> nah, they're rarely that smart

[23:07:02] <LiENUS> i have the container print out on startup that it's validate the fix (it checks the md5sums of the log4j jar files as its validation)
[23:07:03] *** Joins: Ryu945 (Ryu945@gateway/vpn/protonvpn/ryu945)
[23:07:45] <fearnothing> I used to do vulnerability scanning for an enterprise (25k users) and things like this would turn up often, like we'd deploy a fix or mitigation and the scanner would still flag it as vulnerable

[23:08:20] <fearnothing> auditors would shit a brick and we'd just have to throw paperwork at them showing how we'd handled it until they accepted
[23:08:38] <fearnothing> auditors love paperwork
[23:08:42] <fearnothing> so document document document
[23:08:45] <LiENUS> man it's easy for a scanner to check this too, read it as a zip file, look in META-INF/MANIFEST.MF
[23:08:59] <LiENUS> Log4jReleaseVersion: 2.17.0
[23:09:02] <LiENUS> right there lol
[23:09:07] <fearnothing> lot of easy things that scanners don't do :P
[23:09:26] <fearnothing> I don't write the damn things, I don't know why they handle it that way
[23:09:33] <fearnothing> I just know that's how it is

[23:10:21] <LiENUS> preventing false positives probably just isn't even considered in their design
[23:10:55] <LiENUS> its documented as fixed in the container logs i'll just have to see about going a little further by screwing with classpaths
[23:11:17] *** Joins: trevors (~trevors@c-65-96-171-157.hsd1.ma.comcast.net)
[23:13:56] <fearnothing> well at the end of the day if someone questions it and you can just hand them a bit of paper that says "yes I know it still flags it, it's wrong, here's why, you can check if you want" you'll save yourself time. Also if you leave and some new person comes along they have a chance to read it before screaming "aaaaaah all our shit is vulnerable"
[23:20:31] <LiENUS> I'm putting it into the relevant issue on the issue tracker now
