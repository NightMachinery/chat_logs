[15:33:14] <rawtaz> i think youre onto something - a lot of the use has to do with integrating with existing infra such as on-prem domains and systems, as well as office 365. i have a customer which does that and theres no way they could use AWS for the same level of integration or usability
[15:33:25] <rawtaz> i think that simply put, MS offers things that others cant

[15:54:41] <Deknos> yeah, and europeans (i also am one) are lazy. if you are already locked in/invested, why change? thanks to cloudnative stuff you can run most of the features in azure, even if azure platforms itself may perhaps be a little bit worse.
[15:54:59] <Deknos> also MS/Azure managed to sell the "we care about your data privacy" a little bit better at least in my home city
[15:55:11] <Deknos> which is frankly surprising

[17:56:47] <egy> i thought AWS was the only multibillion company there
[17:58:50] <rawtaz> shad: should there be anything on http://mtvs.io ?
[17:59:11] <rawtaz> egy: i think its one of the first if not the first EU site MS had :o
[17:59:40] <rawtaz> its quite old. i did some AWS work last year and discovered that certain services/features werent available there, or rather, only old versions of them were available.
[18:10:08] <shad> rawtaz: there should, but I don't have any more money to give DO for my cluster
[18:10:18] <shad> if only my readers would use my DO referal link ... :D
[18:10:52] <rawtaz> oh ok
[18:10:57] <rawtaz> what is that service about anyway?
[18:11:55] <shad> it's a video game I made. Phaser 3 client, NodeJS+SocketIO backend. Think Hotline Miami Multiplayer Mode on a .io website
[18:12:27] <rawtaz> oh cool! i love phaser :D
[18:12:53] <shad> worked during a sabbatical on it, didn't finish the gameplay loop but i had players in the same room, some kind of dead reckoning for movement, was picking weapons up
[18:13:07] <rawtaz> nice
[18:13:52] <shad> i only keep it up and running when I'm looking for a job :D
[18:14:09] <rawtaz> hah ok
[18:16:40] <shad> i don't know if I can find free k8s cluster, or at least cheap ones
[18:17:03] <rawtaz> i guess you cant
[18:17:09] <rawtaz> i mean free. cheap is relative
[18:17:19] <shad> but with a one node + control plane + LB at Digital Ocean, it makes about 25$/month, and i don't use it enough to justify that cost
[18:17:29] <rawtaz> what you could do is release the source so others can run it if they want, and contribute as well
[18:19:33] <shad> i don't think much people would like to use my spaghetti code, and there was a world where if I was more skilled/determined/amibitious i'd make some money off it
[18:20:47] <shad> i was trying to make more or less https://surviv.io/, with Hotline Miami graphics instead of agar.io style
[18:21:03] <shad> blood, violence, gore, the whole thing
[18:22:00] <rawtaz> hehe
[18:22:16] <rawtaz> surviv.io lost me after the first two popups i had to click to get to the game
[18:22:44] <shad> yeah i see that, they really fucked up on that UI
[18:23:37] <shad> when I was making mtvs, all they had on their website was a "play" button and poof you're in game
[18:27:22] <rawtaz> oh, thats cute :)
[18:27:25] <rawtaz> i like that
[18:29:35] <rawtaz> darnit. i have a prediction :( Rust will take over a huge part of the dev market, simply because its what's the thing to use when doing WASM stuff

[19:38:19] <shad> how are you guys looking for new jobs ?
[19:38:36] <shad> linkedin, network, other ?
[19:39:05] <rawtaz> not at all. but if i was i would look at specific groups on linked in as well as various consultancy sites where jobs are published
[19:40:12] <shad> have you ever done consultant, as in freelance job ?
[19:40:27] <rawtaz> thats all i do, i was last employed around 2009/10
[19:40:35] <shad> in DevOps. I don't know if full remote devops freelance is something i'd be able to do
[19:40:45] <rawtaz> and thats a problem because a lot of companies want to hire instead of a consultant, which sucks
[19:41:00] <rawtaz> why not?
[19:42:56] <shad> i'm afraid of how to find jobs and how to bill people, and for what
[19:43:48] <shad> like, what does a client usually ask for, and what's the rate. Itemized bills ? all of that i'm not prepared for :p
[19:44:53] <rawtaz> right
[19:45:23] <rawtaz> i guess the best recommendation is that you actually start looking, frequently, at the consulting gig ads there are and that are serious, so you get a feel for what they ask for, what they offer, whats important to them, and what the rates might be.
[19:45:46] <rawtaz> there's aso a devops/sre spreadsheet that you can find a link to in ##sre i think, which lists current jobs and maybe also rates
[19:46:35] <rawtaz> i would say that the more you can be a "one gig at a time" type of consultant and build up a timeline, the better the chances are for having a gig most of the time. it SUCKS when you have a lot of gigs at the same time because you cnat build a proper timeline/CV out of it so dont do that
[19:46:47] <rawtaz> but in general, start collecting info instead of being unsure!
[19:47:10] <rawtaz> and when you feel ready for it, just start a company and take small gigs on the side, so you get a feel for it. then you can go more permanently with time.
[19:47:33] <rawtaz> oftentimes people also recommend you to others if you did a good job, which of course you will do
[19:49:14] <shad> I already have a company to my names, but never used it. All the paper work is already done though
[19:49:46] <shad> Is something like "build me a CI/CD pipeline" or "deploy my stuff to k8s via ArgoCD" the kind of job you can get ?
[19:55:01] <rawtaz> so if someone wanted to hire you as a consultant, not an employee, you could just start working and then send an invoice right now? thats good
[19:55:24] <rawtaz> yes, definitely. theres a lot of companies that arent using devops at all or much and want someone to lead them into that in practice
[20:01:11] <egy> shad: currently linkedin
[20:01:30] <egy> which sux but all the gigs are there
[20:01:56] <egy> also i learned that remote jobs are available if you're only a senior
[20:02:03] <egy> remote SRE jobs *
[20:03:44] <rawtaz> egy: you mean that only senior SREs get the remote jobs?
[20:04:21] <egy> from what i have seen, yes. this is especially true if you're outside the country
[20:04:44] <egy> so if you're outside US and thought of getting a junior SRE job, good luck with that
[20:05:27] <egy> same for EU, it does a lot of gatekeeping
[20:06:23] <egy> only a handful pass through (again, if you're not inside EU or a specific country, then chances become low)

[20:12:22] <rawtaz> i guess thats what youre talkjing about
[20:12:52] <slaughter> What's a junior SRE job anyway
[20:13:15] <slaughter> Like, you'd need to be at least late-junior or mid tier developer to reasonably be able to be in the devops space
[20:13:44] <slaughter> Unless you're just looking at those grody straight up infra/SRE jobs that don't need any development experience at all. But those are grody
[20:17:26] <Deknos> well your senior developer will be an junior sre :D
[20:17:31] <shad> i'm about to leave junior tier i think
[20:18:20] <shad> Master in IT (5y study), 1y of backend dev, 1y of fucking around sabbatical, 1y of devops.  
[20:18:48] <shad> looking at my options now that I get bored of my place
[20:19:31] <rawtaz> i think its important to understand that devops != SRE though :) SRE is more like being able to understand a lot of things and solve many different problems, whereas devops is of course similar but with a different docus and not as all-around (IMO)
[20:19:56] <shad> i'm probaby more SRE than devops. Y'know, the whole "devops team" thing
[20:20:08] <shad> if you have a devops team you ain't doing devops
[20:20:11] <rawtaz> shad: i highly recommend getting small gigs on the side to start with, while youre still employed. perhaps go down a bit in employment hours if needed, but make a smooth transition
[20:22:14] <shad> rawtaz: will do, I don't know yet how to find small gigs though, all I see is full time employment
[20:22:28] <shad> i'm not advertising freelance devops skill yet tho
[20:26:27] <rawtaz> if you do that on linked in im sure youll get a lot of offers

[20:35:10] <egy> shad: i'm not an expert, but why not do some freelance jobs on the side ?

[20:39:40] <rawtaz> shad: if you ask me - it's not a question. of course you saw it when it popped up. then you determine if that is something which needs to be addressed at that opint of if it can wait until the regular working hours (including relating the situation to other systems and in particular any daditional side effects the situation can have)
[20:39:40] <slaughter> <rawtaz> i think its important to understand that devops != SRE though -> could you tell this to employers?

[20:40:38] <shad> rawtaz: i know

[20:52:04] <slaughter> I've been working with it a lot lately and other than personally hating OOP I've found it really nice
[20:53:30] <rawtaz> i just find ruby horrible. perhaps not the syntax, but the ecosystem/tooling around it

[20:54:04] <rawtaz> but i sure aint alone in not liking ruby stuff
[20:54:19] <rawtaz> i think gitlab is great but over my dead body that ill run it as long as its built on ruby

[22:52:31] <Deknos> did anyone of you play with nerdctl?
[22:53:22] <rawtaz> not i
[22:56:56] <Deknos> this looks interesting
[22:57:05] <Deknos> especially loading images also over ipfs
[22:59:31] <kubblai> i have Deknos as an alternative to docker desktop on m1 macs alongside lima. it didnt last long since it was buggy af but i think that was more lima's fault
[23:00:53] <Deknos> okay, i would also think it only works reliable on linux
[23:02:26] <kubblai> rancherdesktop is one to look at too its in beta and IS buggy but if it works for you its really mnice
[23:07:38] <kubblai> rancherdesktop uses nerdctl and containerd
