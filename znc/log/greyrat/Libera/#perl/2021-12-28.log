[05:38:49] <aquanight> hot dayum
[05:38:59] <Adura> Just needed 2 characters.
[05:41:55] <aquanight> wtf is DYNFILE
[05:42:14] <aquanight> meh. not really relevant to what I'm dealing with. I'll look it up later.
[05:43:03] <aquanight> although
[05:43:22] <aquanight> this might be where I want a warning or something.
[05:43:28] <aquanight> if I do
[05:43:46] <aquanight> sub Some_Constant :prototype() { some_pure_sub(stuff) } expecting it to become a constant
[05:44:12] <aquanight> if some_pure_sub() dies during the inlining, the exception gets swallowed, the sub is not inlined, and Some_Constant is then not a constant
[05:45:35] <simcop2387> DYNFILE gets used for xs i think? no idea why you'd see that though
[05:46:25] <aquanight> "The filename is malloced" according to cv.h
[05:46:37] <simcop2387> ok i know nothing then

[16:20:54] <simcop2387> Yaakov: yea i've heard it's decent.  I don't want to pay someone else for irc (i'd donate to the server) but that's also why I run a copy of The Lounge for myself for mobile/web access
[16:22:48] <haarg> irccloud does seem like a decent solution. i generally like irc, but it's a lot of effort to get set up well. nice to have a solution for people that don't want to invest so much time doing everything manually.
[16:23:01] <Yaakov> Over the years I used all sorts of strategies for persistent connections. Eventually, I ended up with irssi + screen and some scripts. It worked out just fine, but irccloud is so easy and the web client is good enough that I don't really mind it at all.
[16:23:30] <simcop2387> just as long as you don't want to use freenode :) unless they finally unbanned irccloud there
[16:23:51] <Yaakov> I consider that a feature.
[16:24:24] <simcop2387> i am kinda curious how that place has been fairing after so long, not well i can imagine.
[16:24:44] <Yaakov> It was why I originally signed up. I figured I would use irssi with irccloud, and I wanted to support them for taking a stand, but then it turned out to be really good, so...
[16:26:42] <buZz> simcop2387: honestly , all the 'life time bans' on freenode seem to reset every time littlewannabekoreanboy gets a new delivery from the dealer

[17:45:44] <simcop2387> C:\CON\filename.txt will also hit it

[17:46:00] <aquanight> well
[17:46:11] <aquanight> given that \ is not in \w this would obviously not be matched against a full path
[17:46:35] <simcop2387> also \w won't match spaces which are valid too
[17:47:02] <aquanight> they are valid, but they make using them on command lines a pain
[17:47:31] <aquanight> some of the characters we've mentioned are perfectly cromulant and are only bad because they are painful from either a cmd, bash, or other such things

[17:51:58] <aquanight> why are drive letters even still a thing in this day
[17:52:12] <huf> sneaking a / into a filename with a hexeditor would be _fun_
[17:52:38] <aquanight> I can't help but be curious not only to how the fs driver would handle that
[17:52:48] <aquanight> but also what will fsck do to it
[17:53:13] <huf> i hope there's no special check for this and it just goes hilarious
[17:53:34] <aquanight> I think it would become effectively inaccessible

[17:54:00] <aquanight> no that's the thing
[17:54:02] <aquanight> it's not hidden at all
[17:54:07] <aquanight> it's just not usable
[17:54:23] <aquanight> and would you have to hexedit it back to normal

[18:08:29] <xenu> even the sparc port of windows nt (which was never released) was supposed to be little endian and they added LE support to that cpu specifically for windows
[18:09:05] <aquanight> is there even a mainstream big-endian CPU at this point?
[18:09:28] <aquanight> literally the only big-endian usage I know of is NBO
[18:09:31] <xenu> s390x and powerpc (only under aix, linux is mostly little endian)

[18:10:13] <haarg> arm apparently supports big endian

[18:11:37] <xenu> arm does have BE mode but it wasn't ever widely used.
[18:11:45] <aquanight> I could imagine UTF-16BE being used on network (since NBO) but I think most everyone uses UTF-8 for that now.

[18:13:29] <xenu> some mips and arm routers use BE mode but that's dying too
[18:13:30] <aquanight> I wonder why everyone relevant is LE then.
[18:13:30] <tm604> UTF16BE is the default for network RFCs (there was an RFC about it) - if you don't have a BOM or explicitly define endianness, you get BE - but it's not the most popular network format around.
[18:14:01] <aquanight> tm604: yeah that makes sense. network byte order and all that but like I said I think everyone uses UTF8
[18:14:04] <xenu> aquanight: the main advantage of little endian is that casts are free
[18:14:36] <aquanight> xenu: that actually makes a lot of sense
[18:15:04] <aquanight> as a lot of low-level stuff probably still want to use char and short fields but C(++) integer-promotes at the drop of a hat

[21:14:10] <aquanight> eh
[21:14:36] <aquanight> honestly if people want to use neat syntax tricks to avoid accidental mistakes more power to them
[21:14:45] <aquanight> you lose nothing with so-called "yoda conditionals"
[21:16:30] <aquanight> constant first, variable first, left side, right side, up side, 17-degrees downleft of forward-right side, who cares
[21:20:45] <Yaakov> Given how unlikely it is that you'd actually want to test if an assignment works compared to if there is an equality, perl really should just call that a syntax error and have some other notation to test an assignment.
[21:21:06] <Yaakov> Warnings are better than nothing, but... it should just fail.
[21:22:36] <simcop2387> that's one reason that python didn't support it for the longest time, and only recently got the := operator to explicitly do an assignment in an if statement
[21:22:52] <simcop2387> and honestly i kind of agree, but it wouldn't be perly to do it with a different operator
[21:23:26] <LeoNerd> It is a shame BCPL didn't use the Pascal convention of := for assignment and = for comparison
[21:23:34] <Yaakov> It's such a silent killer for neophytes though.

[22:05:59] <simcop2387> just need a single 10g port for what i want to do

[22:06:44] <simcop2387> basically router/AP attached to the switch, and then also a rpi off a poe, and eventually the router/AP on poe too
[22:07:22] <simcop2387> with the 10g port for going to the rest of the network so that i can do some other cleanup (put cable modem in closet, use switches and vlans to send it to router elsewhere)

[22:21:12] <ham5urg> Yaakov, thanks. Is there a further example avail. with encryption and a simple user-auth (like a txt file)?

[22:22:13] <simcop2387> ham5urg: PoCo::Server::IRC doesn't natively support any of those things, you'd have to build it on top.
[22:22:34] <simcop2387> ham5urg: hence my recommendation of ergo, it supports all that built in with very little configuring to work

[22:23:12] <ham5urg> simcoop2387, go is not perl. I will try perl first.
[22:24:31] <simcop2387> ham5urg: i think the current closest then to what you want is Mojo::IRC::Server::Chinese actually
[22:24:53] <simcop2387> doesn't have native auth built in, but it's possible to add it relatively easily
[22:24:59] <rindolf> for all L \in prog-langs, L != Perl -> L != Perl ;)
[22:25:02] <simcop2387> and i believe supports TLS
[22:25:44] <simcop2387> you'll still likely be missing a decent amount of ircv3 support but it's not a terrible place to start
