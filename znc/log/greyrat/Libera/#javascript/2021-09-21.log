[01:56:32] <sheetjs> so many headaches related to npm.  for example, `npm login --scope` would set the registry for the given scope as well as login.  one of the random npm patch revisions changed that behavior

[01:57:44] <onosendi> sheetjs: I think the headaches without npm would be a lot more headaches, no?
[02:02:46] <sheetjs> a long time ago, npm added update-notifier to the cli tool, whose sole purpose is to check for updates.  it ended up breaking a lot of systems because the dependency used a bare `const` and many supported node releases at the time only enabled es6 behind a flag
[02:05:44] <systemfault> Shit happens everywhere...
[02:08:49] <sheetjs> its a stretch to argue that npm specifically created a ton of ewaste, but the philosophy of rapid deprecation certainly contributes to the problem

[03:05:30] *** Joins: noarb (~noarb@user/noarb)
[03:05:59] <fakuve> and I don't mean `node` , cause `node` doesn't parse websites , then I cannot traverse the DOM
[03:06:19] <earendel> with runkit you can develop almost live with all deployed libs. it lets u create one liner endpoint microservices. which you can curl right after clicking the deploy button. its for experimenting but.. hell. why did it not make really make it although initially featured with node
[03:06:41] <austincheney> fakuve, you can get devtools of both Chrome and Firefox in your terminal via chrome devtools protocol

[03:08:33] <austincheney> you have to start the browser with cdp enabled via a flag.  Then in a terminal application send an http request to the web server opened in the browser for cdp which will respond with the connection points

[18:59:21] <maroloccio> hi. for a beginner class we ought to put a json file online at some http address so that it may be "read" by another program somewhere else. the file should be updatable or if it can't, at least the _link_ to it updated. we could do it with a pastebin service and a link shortner but is there a site that allows sharing of a json file? size requirements: < 1 kb

[22:41:11] <KDev> ljharb, I posted this code a few days ago: https://pastebin.mozilla.org/7hcMsAUV asking if I was on the right track to keeping my code clean such.
[22:41:23] <KDev> And one of the responses I got was:
[22:41:24] <KDev> <wroathe> KDev: If you're going to make calculatorCurrent a global variable you should make that explicit for the reader by doing globalThis.calculatorCurrent  = ...
[22:41:47] <KDev> Assignments to undeclared variables are usually a mistake, and someone will reading this will think you made a mistake
[22:42:18] <KDev> So because of that, I just started using globalThis for my "global" variables, even though they are only supposed to be "global" in my module scope.
[22:42:28] <KDev> Because I thought that was a norm he was saying.
[22:43:15] <KDev> https://pastebin.mozilla.org/DpHFPR2a here is my current code
[22:46:06] <Intelo> ljharb nevermind. just typing bash solved via showing me old terminal. now nvm is working fine

[23:35:40] <KDev> Is the only way to have leading zeros show in a number is to convert to string? like toFixed()
[23:35:56] <KDev> Say I have 0.10, it shows as 0.1 but I want it to show the leading 0
[23:36:14] <KDev> Is there no way to do it only in numbers without converting to string?
[23:37:56] <systemfault> It's formatting, so string-based

[23:30:48] <anddam> 1) is es6 a sensible target in this time and era? (I honestly have no idea)
[23:31:17] <anddam> 2) is there a less verbose way than doing     const yearString = year.toString(); const paddedYear = yearString.length < 2 ? `0${yearString}` : yearString;  ?
