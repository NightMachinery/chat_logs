[02:07:55] *** Joins: tejr (~tejr@user/tejr)
[02:08:02] <ulu> now I am considering replacing the laptop
[02:08:58] <ulu> any particular brand/make you can suggests for a laptop in max 600-700$ range which works well out of the box with Debian?
[02:09:30] <ulu> I remember I had hard time getting rid of windows UEFI from this one
[02:09:50] <Mister00X> ulu:  just for clarification what makes you so sure you can only add 4 gigs or ram and not a dimm with for example 8?
[02:11:04] <ulu> well I checked other user's reviews (mostly youtube videos) as suggetsed here
[02:11:40] <PMT> Does the vendor's spec sheet also say you can't?
[02:12:02] <Mister00X> ulu:  hmm I am not an expert on that topic but it shoud technically be possible to add more ram if and only if the bios supports +4 GB ram
[02:12:43] <PMT> Mister00X: it sounds like the consensus is it supports 8GB in 2x4GB, the question is whether it supports more.
[02:13:17] <Mister00X> PMT:  yes I agree on that you where just faster typing than me
[02:14:39] <Mister00X> and you expressed yourself in a more clear way (less prone to missunderstandings) than me
[02:14:55] <ulu> PMT I can't find specs on lenovo website, but a third party website mentions that the max ram is 8GB
[02:15:17] <PMT> ulu: what model?
[02:16:17] <ulu> B590 (MBX2BMH)
[02:17:16] <PMT> I wish Lenovo provided the same detail of useful information for all their lines.
[02:17:54] *** Quits: hitest (~hitest@user/hitest) (Quit: Leaving)
[02:19:31] <ulu> also 2x8GB DDR3 would cost around 180$ which is not a cheap quick solution. so i would prefer replacing it for a more log term solution (as it also doesn't have an SDD) 
[02:19:36] *** Quits: i0e (~is0ke3@user/is0ke3) (Quit: Zzzzzz.....)
[02:19:43] <PMT> This is true.
[02:20:38] <ulu> so any good Debian-oriented laptops you can suggest?
[02:21:53] <PMT> You know your requirements better than anyone. I am fond of Lenovo ThinkPads, possibly refurbished or older models if they don't fit in your budget, and I've had minimal problems running Linux on my last couple, though I have relatively light needs. I also had acceptable experiences when I last tried Dell Inspirons, though that was many years ago and I'd expect the Latitudes or Precisions to be more robust.
[02:22:30] <PMT> I'm sure other people have varyingly strong opinions too.
[02:23:16] <PMT> System76 specializes in this sort of thing, but I've never bought one from them, and they might be outside the budget you specified.
[02:24:01] <Mister00X> ulu: If you want a really linux compatible laptop and live in europe I would reccomend TUXEDO computers but they will charge higher than your budget

[12:54:26] <jelly> gurki, if you don't need swap, that's some extra space.  You can fit a decent amount of useful services in 2GiB.  I'm running a VM with vpn, proxy, on a 10GB disk with 1.8G used for OS.  Watch out for space taken by new linux kernel packages.

[13:00:44] <Anywhere> Hey! I'm trying to install debian on my moms laptop but the wifi isn't recognized. It says it's missing rtlwifi/rtl8821aefw_29.bin and a few others. How do I put them on usb for the installer to recognize them? I triend /rtlwifi/rtl8821aefw_29.bin /firmware/rtlwifi/rtl8821aefw_29.bin.

[13:02:38] <jelly> !firmware images
[13:02:38] <dpkg> There are <live> system and <netinst> and DVD images containing non-free Debian <firmware> packages available from https://cdimage.debian.org/cdimage/unofficial/non-free/cd-including-firmware/current/amd64/iso-cd/ The images are "unofficial" because "official Debian" includes only 100% free software. They are otherwise identical to the normal installer images and prepared by the same Debian Developers. See <check iso>.

[18:18:29] <ratrace> is there a tool for convenience build of random python version in a virtualenv? or should I get my hands dirty with a good ol' compile
[18:18:39] <Mister00X> ratrace:  pipenv
[18:18:59] <ratrace> Mister00X: does that actually build the python version of choice? or does it only link to existing python?
[18:19:22] <Mister00X> I think it uses pip to download and installt the specified version
[18:19:30] <ratrace> lemme check it then
[18:20:01] <Mister00X> Usage Examples:
[18:20:01] <Mister00X>    Create a new project using Python 3.7, specifically:
[18:20:02] <Mister00X>    $ pipenv --python 3.7
[18:20:14] <Mister00X> from https://pypi.org/project/pipenv/
[18:20:42] <ratrace> Mister00X: yeah, no, that one expects python3.7 to already exist on the system
[18:21:24] <ratrace> so python virtualenv TOOLS only link to _existing_ python, and create a PATH munge'd virtualenv dir. What I need is literally what nobyk asked, but downgraded, 3.7 on bullseye.

[18:27:08] <ratrace> nobyk: which ansible tho? ansible on buster works jsut fine with buster's python3.7
[18:27:10] <milkt> coyotes4ys: take a look at https://wiki.debian.org/IRC
[18:27:38] <nobyk> yeah it's working, I was just wondering with the warning message
[18:27:51] <ratrace> nobyk: python version never changes for the duration of a release lifecycle. buster has 3.7. if you need 3.8+, then that's bullseye's 3.9. mind the backwards incompatibilities tho.
