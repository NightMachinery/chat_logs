[05:30:19] <Zipheir> Most of the SICP code would break without it...
[05:32:02] <klf> Zipheir, just to clarlify what he said.
[05:32:13] <klf> the gentleman said: "inner defines need to be at the top of the function"
[05:32:47] <Zipheir> OK, that's different.
[05:33:06] <klf> in any case, I am just wondering why the above code runs without errors while in Racket the interpreter would emitt the following:
[05:33:30] <Zipheir> klf: It's not quite right, though.  It needs to be at the top of any <body>.
[05:33:33] <klf> err_msg: x: undefined;

[05:39:31] <klf> Zipheir, what's correct?
[05:39:41] <Zipheir> At least according to R7RS, that's equivalent to (define (foo x) (display x) (letrec* ((x 5)) x)).
[05:39:47] <Zipheir> klf: What you wrote.
[05:40:30] <tokie> i thought that it's not legal since the define is not at the beginning of the block?
[05:40:52] <Zipheir> Oh, yeah. nvm, missed that.
[05:41:03] <klf> yea... (display x) is a body :p
[05:41:38] <Zipheir> Plenty of Schemes will allow that, though.
[05:41:47] <tokie> chez definitely errors
[05:41:55] <klf> what is chez?
[05:42:01] <tokie> an implementation of scheme
[05:42:10] <Zipheir> Well, that's R6, so I expect far more rigor.
[05:43:16] <Zipheir> Than, e.g. CHICKEN, which happily accepts it.
[05:43:35] <tokie> chicken creates a lexical binding at least?
[05:43:43] <tokie> it'd be lulz if it was global
[05:44:29] <Zipheir> Yeah, that would be disastrous.  It's local.
[05:44:57] <Zipheir> It probably just shuffles the defines to the head of the body.
[05:45:22] <tokie> in my scheme i scan forward for (defines) in the body and create environment slots, and then the (defines) emit the same code that set! would
[05:45:30] <tokie> i'm guessing chicken does something similarly

[06:26:56] <klf> I am going to handle this in the next sprint.
[06:27:31] <tokie> you're learning scheme at work??? that sounds too much fun to be work
[06:29:37] <klf> It's for a compiler course.  I never should've chosen a (dynamic type (input) -> static type (target)) compiler for a project.

[06:30:29] <tokie> yeah, that is a big task

[06:30:59] <tokie> http://scheme2006.cs.uchicago.edu/11-ghuloum.pdf i think this one?
[06:31:10] <Zipheir> That doesn't sound bad to me.  It's easy enough to implement a statically-typed language in Scheme.

[09:27:37] <Zipheir> klf: A value that's not yet defined is allowed to appear in a lambda body.  But this should probably cause a warning from a compiler.
[09:28:19] <Zipheir> i.e. if the entire source has been parsed and there's no definition for y.
[09:29:15] <Zipheir> s/value/name/
[09:30:05] <klf> I see.  (in other words, REPL and compiler exhibit different behaviors)
[09:30:29] <Zipheir> They should, in this case, I think.
[09:31:58] <Zipheir> Some non-Scheme REPLs like ghci require everything to be defined ("in order"), and it's very annoying.

[20:12:32] <Zipheir> Yeah, SRFI 1 provides the `first' alias.

[20:18:45] <johnjaye> same with car and cdr no?
[20:19:10] <Zipheir> Yeah.  first, second, third, ... are just aliases for list-ref, anyway.
[20:19:29] <johnjaye> i don't know of any consistent naming for "safe" versions of these functions
[20:19:33] <johnjaye> other than car-safe, cdr-safe, etc

[20:20:11] <wasamasa> I think I wanted to have this once, but I don't remember what for
[20:20:24] <johnjaye> i saw something like that in elisp one time. i guess you can just use exxceptions... oh wait scheme
[20:20:42] <Zipheir> johnjaye: Scheme has exceptions.
[20:20:51] <Zipheir> Well, R6 and R7 do.
[20:20:55] <johnjaye> wasn't that one of the big kerfuffles in R6?
[20:21:13] <johnjaye> oh like in R7-large or whatever the formal name is?
[20:21:17] <Zipheir> The condition system, yes, but exceptions are in R7-small, too.
[20:21:22] <johnjaye> oh ok
[20:22:15] <Zipheir> IIUC the issue with conditions in R6 is that it broke a lot of existing condition systems, because every error situation *must* raise exactly *this* kind of condition.
[20:22:57] <Zipheir> So R7RS-small doesn't say anything about what kinds of conditions are raised.
