[12:26:27] <doc> Exactly. Now imagine how your browser feels when you leave out markup

[12:26:58] <programmar> i mean i can still just do <h1>Hello world</h1> without any other, it will still render things the same

[12:28:03] <programmar> what is the exact name of this "idiot developer mode" yuou are talking about, i would like to mess around with it
[12:28:06] <doc> there's a reason the topic links to a validator for people who ask for help, because if you're page isn't valid then your browser is trying to parse garbage, and if you put garbage in, what do you get out?
[12:28:15] <doc> *your page
[12:30:04] <doc> the common name is quirks mode, but like with people, no one should call themselves quirky

[19:45:00] <omen> does it make sense to use form for single button? Or just use a hyperlink? For example this one button removes items and it would make sense to use method='delete' and form
[19:45:45] <omen> but it would work with just with a hyperlink but that would submit get request instead of delete
