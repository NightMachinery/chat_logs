[03:05:56] <freakingpenguin> (insert-file-contents-literally "01.txt" nil 0 (1- (file-attribute-size (file-attributes "01.txt")))) seems to work. probably not the best solution though.

[03:06:47] <bpalmer> again, though, that relies on the file ending in a newline; chomp only removes newlines, not other characters (contrast with chop)
[03:07:04] <bpalmer> I assume ruby follows perl in this regard.
[03:08:36] <bpalmer> so you end up with something ugly like (concat (buffer-substring (point-min) (1- (point-max))) (save-excursion (goto-char (1- (point-max))) (if (char-equal ?\n (char-after)) "" (list (char-after)))))
[03:09:12] <bpalmer> and at that point, char-delete is looking pretty attractive.

[05:23:48] <twb> aidalgol: with revolvers especially, "single-action" means you manually pull back (cock) the hammer, and trigger releases it.
[05:23:58] <twb> aidalgol: "double-action" means trigger pull first cocks, then releases the hammer
[05:24:25] <twb> aidalgol: single-action is simpler and more accurate, but slower.  Sort of like bolt action vs. semi-auto
[05:24:52] <twb> aidalgol: some revolvers (quite a lot, I think) can operate in either mode, with a seletor lever
[05:25:22] <twb> In principle the functionality is the same for a pistol

But in GTK Emacs, it seems that none of the symbols will appear when using this font (I always get the box with the codepoint number)

[05:40:09] <grym> the bruise fades in about a week 
[05:40:15] <grym> twb: not even close to true 
[05:40:24] <grym> there's an overlap of several centuries
[05:40:34] <twb> >handwave<
[05:40:40] <grym> during which time bows dominated, and saw major advances 
[05:40:56] <aidalgol> grym: As long as none of the required motions put strain on joints.
[05:40:58] <grym> (there were cammed bows, if you count the winch-loading crossbows with metal prods)
[05:41:07] <homerj> you know, that's something I always wondered...you would think when things like line infantry were popular and they had muskets
[05:41:14] <homerj> that a bow would just be more useful
[05:41:24] <grym> homerj: higher RoF for a long time.  
[05:41:31] <twb> grym: OK pin the starting point then at decent metallurgy needed for the bow body itself, which was probably equivalent to steam age
[05:41:38] <aidalgol> I have to avoid lost of forms of martial arts because so many of the moves would just fuck up my joints in the long run.
[05:41:46] <twb> grym: I guess that's then only like 1850 to 1900 or so

[05:42:42] <twb> homerj: I thought 3/min was the sustained fire rate for longbowmen

[05:53:15] <homerj> I'd have to dig up the book
[05:53:33] <grym> homerj: the literature on stacked reloads at large battles is also interesting 
[05:53:38] <homerj> and "Mouser" was the mouse guy at the end of level 1 of Super Mario Bros. 2

[07:26:47] <pingpongball> thanks it is also fine if it is not possible , i'm fine with titlebar
[07:27:14] <jeetelongname> yeah it might just be easier to put it in the title bar

[08:41:14] <aidalgol> Yeah, I really like how org renders links as hyperlinks in the editor.  I don't know of any markdown editor that does that.  You have to render it to make it look nice.

[09:42:07] <wgreenhouse> advent of code?
[09:43:08] <winny> yes though i like to think i use racket for other stuff when given the opportunity :)
[09:44:55] <codingquark> winny: none! I used Debian's apt sources to install racket which comes with drracket etc all bundled. I borg-assimilated racket-mode and things are working
[09:45:20] <rk4> curious what the attraction is over say plain ol scheme or CL
[09:45:21] <codingquark> I am not getting completions yet, but I will check that later. I don't like automatically popping things in my Emacs

[09:46:21] <winny> should i use borg, i sometimes find myself manually adding submodules to my .emacs.d

[09:47:37] <winny> are you gunna write your code in org babel?
[09:48:09] <aniketgm> rk4: and i gues you get all the good things of CL and Scheme.
[09:48:27] <codingquark> winny: ha ha, yes!
[09:48:38] <winny> this is what i do currently, quite a few things are `use-packaged`ed from site-lisp or using :load-path to a submod

[19:39:44] <Wafficus> How do I file away the top '** Task' underneat the '** Week of 11-22-2021' heading?
[19:40:00] <ecraven> hm.. the emacs-slack package actually doesn't look bad, I'll just try that..
[19:40:06] <ecraven> and I'll look into the discord bridge thing too ;)

[19:40:18] <Wafficus> I tried to do this but that lower, deeper heading doesn't show up in Helm via 'helm-mode-org-refile'
[19:40:42] <Wafficus> is there a related config setting to allow tasks to be refiled into infinite depths

[19:50:06] <Wafficus> Found the directions on how to fix 'emacs-slack' via the mailing list responses in GitHub ecraven:
[19:50:09] <Wafficus>  1. fork the repo (if you want only this PR, just clone https://github.com/aculich/emacs-slack/tree/cookie and switch to the cookie branch and skip directly to point 4)
[19:50:10] <Wafficus>  2. merge the PR you need in your branch
[19:50:10] <Wafficus>  3. clone the repo in your directory (e.g., ~/where-the-git-repo-is/emacs-slack)

[19:54:02] <hodapp> v/q?
[19:54:03] <mwnaylor> Other than splitting a window, is there a way of freezing the top line(s)? The discussion on units of measure prompeted me to pull up the units table in calc; wanted to keep column headings in view as I scrolled down.
[19:54:54] <bpalmer> quotient space of v, one might assume.
[19:55:22] <Wafficus> you mean this zebrag

[19:55:24] <Wafficus> ?
[19:55:42] <zebrag> yes

[19:58:14] <zebrag> Wafficus: really I was meaning something even more elementary: when you are with "dired", if yo type "v" it open the file in vew-mode, and then you type "q", and it closes the file and goes back to the dired view.
[19:58:59] <mwnaylor> bpalmer: I thought so, but worth asking.
[19:59:16] <taeaad> Any thoughts on undo-redo vs. undo-tree?
[19:59:37] *** Quits: pmy (~user@user/pmy) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[19:59:47] <cvandusen> ,undo-redo 
[19:59:48] <fsbot> Why do you say,undo redo? 
[20:00:07] <cvandusen> whimsy?? 
[20:00:07] <fsbot> Outlook not so good
[20:00:19] <rpav> undo-tree avoids losing content, and has saved me a number of times, i can't imagine not using it
[20:00:32] <mwnaylor> With dired, I don't remember all the key mappings; slows me down at times. It's pretty good at deleting, copying, moving (renaming), etc.
[20:00:36] <zebrag> but, if you know about fuzzy finders of any sort, I was about to ask about some things to find things in a somehow large bunch of files
[20:00:53] <cvandusen> taeaad: I've never heard of undo-redo, but as rpav said, undo-tree is essential for me.
[20:00:53] <taeaad> rpav: That's a good argument.
[20:01:31] *** Joins: pmy (~user@user/pmy)
[20:01:35] <taeaad> I think that I've been using a linear undo and redo, which is what I meant by undo-redo. But maybe it's not called undo-redo.
[20:01:53] <rpav> that's what i figured you meant
[20:02:01] <cvandusen> It may be the built-in undo. 
[20:02:11] *** Joins: gopar (~gopar@c-67-164-79-22.hsd1.ca.comcast.net)
[20:02:14] <taeaad> So undo-tree is not default, right?
[20:02:19] <cvandusen> Right
[20:02:24] <rpav> right you have to get the package and enable it
[20:02:50] <taeaad> Alright.
[20:03:56] <mwnaylor> Also like the C-x C-q cancels read only mode and allows for directly changing file names. C-c to commint, C-k to abort. Much like editing macros or managing commits in magit. Using common keystrokes for similar actions across packages makes emacs more usable.
[20:04:08] <taeaad> Is the tree's branches based on the state of the file you have opened?
[20:04:46] <taeaad> I think it must be, but unless you use a mouse at some point to move around you could base it on keystrokes.

[20:05:59] <zebrag> dired: `v` is `(dired-view-file)`, `q` is `(view-quit)`, and it's very convenient
[20:06:05] <Wafficus> more so, because that's just a bit of a hacky workaround since there are some keybindings that you can accidentally kill lines if you don't know what you're doing

[20:06:34] <vdv> hi :) how to show a overview of the functions and definitions in a sidebar? like tagbar in vim
[20:06:39] <Wafficus> it just gives 'h' is undefined

[20:06:44] <taeaad> I've also grown to ignore Dired.
[20:06:44] <vdv> like speedbar or sth
[20:06:46] <Wafficus> when I hit '?', and then 'h' in Dired
[20:07:02] <Wafficus> I might just resort to the weird glitchy 'ranger.el' instead again
[20:07:14] <bremner> or just us a shell?
[20:07:19] <bremner> s/use/use/
[20:07:21] <bremner> err.
[20:07:23] <Wafficus> Since really, Dired just makes me want to quit Emacs alltogether, but I won't since there's always something ebtter
[20:07:30] <Wafficus> I've used 'vterm' with ranger, yeah
[20:07:45] <Wafficus> but its just not seamless
[20:07:52] <bremner> I mean more like just use zsh
[20:07:55] <bremner> ymmv
[20:07:55] <Wafficus> then again, I could probably set my '$EDITOR' variable to Emacs

[20:08:25] <Wafficus> the problem is that I think when I set my $EDITOR to 'emacs' before, it would keep spawning new instances of Emacs
[20:08:27] <Wafficus> which is really annoying
[20:08:34] <taeaad> bremner: Yeah. Dired is like vi ./directory. Usually a mistake.
[20:08:40] *** Joins: galex-713 (~quassel@galex-713.eu)
[20:08:58] <Wafficus> is there a way I can force only one Emacs instance per machine instead of it spawning multiple instances?

[20:09:08] <grym> i like dired 
[20:09:08] <bremner> Wafficus: there is emacsclient

[20:09:39] <Wafficus> hard to describe I know, a bit weird

[20:13:45] <Wafficus> how do bookmarks work in that respect? I ask because often I have to go back to the 'Dashboard' package I use on startup for my recent files

[20:17:01] <taeaad> cvandusen, rpav: Do you visualise the undo tree?
[20:17:11] <Wafficus> Just wanted to give you an update since I kind of put it off, since the process looked a bit intimidating as I just use MELPA, and not GitHub packages directly in my Emacs config
[20:17:57] <Wafficus> You should check out 'popup-kill-ring.el' as well taeaad cvandusen rpav
[20:18:24] <Wafficus> I know paste buffers aren't really undo related, but its SLIGHTLY related to a similar workflow. I find this to be super helpful, and bound this to M-y personally
[20:18:46] <rpav> taeaad: yeah that's basically all i use, i'm not even sure about what else there is

[20:19:49] <taeaad> rpav: Cool, thanks. Let me check my holy list of shortcuts.

[20:36:41] <Catie> johnjay: would transpose-chars work?
[20:37:35] <Catie> Wafficus: I don't use EXWM, I use StumpWM. Which has a similar configuration format with Common Lisp, but I don't know that it would be of much help to you
[20:37:35] <johnjay> hrm. i didn't think it was composable. but i think it is.
[20:37:59] <johnjay> i don't think C-t goes backward though is the problem
[20:38:17] <treflip> zebrag: no, it's active, the most recent commit from thierryvolpiatto was today
[20:38:27] <johnjay> it says it goes backward if arg is negative
[20:38:28] <Catie> johnjay: You could make a pretty short lambda with transpose-chars and backward-char

[20:38:49] <_73> Wafficus: I also have used `Space2Ctrl https://github.com/r0adrunner/Space2Ctrl` which makes holding the spacebar work as a control key. Unfortunately though it prevented me from making XFCE keybindings that use space.
[20:38:56] <Wafficus> thanks treflip
[20:39:04] <johnjay> yes i guess i'll have to. M-- C-t is not very easy to hti
[20:39:09] <johnjay> this is the big problem with emacs.
[20:39:14] <Wafficus> Yeah I want to get Spacemacs type spacebar keybindings to work so bad
[20:39:17] <johnjay> unfortunately i think doom kind of solves it
[20:39:18] <Wafficus> I have no idea how to start though
[20:39:29] <Wafficus> I don't think there's really a package that they have made that separates that out
[20:39:31] <johnjay> most of the key combos you need to repeat need to be 1 key. or 1 modifier + 1 key tops
[20:39:33] <Catie> Wafficus: That being said, I do very much recommend StumpWM if you're looking to try a new window manager!
[20:39:35] <Wafficus> I really like the Spacemacs spacebar leader ideas
[20:39:52] <_73> Wafficus: emacs spacebar keybindings work with Space2Ctrl.
[20:39:53] <johnjay> like in this case ideally it should be 1 key or 2 at most to go forward and backward
[20:39:58] <Wafficus> Catie yeah we'll see haha :)  I'm looking for a basic DE setup as I'm looking to use this computer for more notes on my artwork, etc
[20:40:08] <Wafficus> More so, Emacs would be probably the most complicated thing on the PC, etc
[20:40:08] <johnjay> but most of the C-x M-f M-a combos are taken
[20:40:23] <johnjay> probably should get around to defining a bunch of these with hyper
[20:40:39] <johnjay> but i forgot hyper doesn't work in terminal. at least... i think it doesn't.
[20:40:45] <Catie> Wafficus: Oh, XFCE is excellent, it's my go-to for people who don't use tiling window managers
[20:41:09] <Wafficus> I like tiling though in some respect to be fair, but not too crazy stuff
[20:41:18] <Wafficus> we'll see if I like XFCE in that respect
[20:41:40] <rpav> hlwm tiling is what works for me .. i like to pre-split desktops and put windows where i want them
[20:41:41] <Wafficus> I liked my minimal Openbox setups because I got some basic tiling and other keybindings to open stuff up too
[20:41:42] <treflip> Catie: my goto for those who prefer floating to tiling and are computer savvy is FVWM. It's really cool. You can build your own desktop environment on top of that XD

[22:16:15] <andreyorst> and a similar question about adding extra font-lock keywords via dir-locals, I also have to use (eval . (font-lock-add-keywords 'foo-mode '(("\\<\\(bar\\)\\>" 1 'font-lock-keyword-face))))
[22:16:33] <andreyorst> which also works, but, I have a feeling that I'm doing it wrong

[22:58:03] <andreyorst> here's an example of what I have now, and would like to simplify without cluttering safe-local-variable-values: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andreyorst/fennel-test/master/.dir-locals.el
[22:59:00] <andreyorst> because putting all font-lock keywords under single font-lock-add-keywords call, will put whole expression into custom file, and thus, if I add another keyword, everything will be duplicated essentially

[23:00:26] <bpalmer> andreyorst: perhaps fennel supports a variable like fennel-extra-keywords which gets folded into font-lock-keywords (some modes do)
[23:00:36] <bpalmer> if not, you can derive your own mode from fennel-mode which does.
[23:00:56] <bpalmer> (or even write your own mode which hard-codes in support for things like assert-eq)

[23:03:14] <andreyorst> well, fennel-mode supports whatever I can add to it (I'm one of the maintainers) :D
[23:03:56] <andreyorst> this still leaves the question about duplication in user's custom file though
[23:04:00] <technomancy> in general I get the feeling that "add this value to an existing list" is a really important use case that dir-locals just completely misses out on
[23:04:15] <bpalmer> ah. Then I'd consider providing an "-extra-keywords" variable that users can customize
[23:04:19] <bpalmer> that's what org does, as an example

[23:04:32] <bpalmer> org-font-lock-extra-keywords
[23:05:08] <bpalmer> also, consider an official fennel-test-mode as that derived mode, if this is a common framework.
[23:05:13] <andreyorst> mhm, these have a bit more to them, as they also highligth other symbols, acting as a somewhat semantic highlighting
[23:05:50] <andreyorst> bpalmer: no, I just write such file for all my libraries, so anyone could copy them if they're using emacs
[23:06:17] <andreyorst> but by no means fennel-test is a common thing
[23:07:23] <bpalmer> OK, I don't see how they highlight other symbols, in at least most of that example paste.

[23:07:57] <rudybot> wasamasa: if you're interested, I eventually figured out the exclude "\n\n" regexp (using rx, no less) https://gist.github.com/rnkn/8413038

[23:08:03] <rudybot> wasamasa: rnkn was seen in #emacs one day ago, saying "that's it? c'mon", and then rnkn was seen quitting one day ago, saying "Quit: rnkn"
[23:08:05] <andreyorst> bpalmer: if ( is before the `deftest' it is highligted as a keyword, and the word after it is highligted as a function.

[23:08:55] <andreyorst> there are two font-lock rules for it, in the link I've posted
[23:11:13] <andreyorst> technomancy: do you think we can have a contrib directory in the fennel-mode package, and let users submit a minor modes, that add keyword highlighting and indentation rules for their libraries? A kinda wild idea tho

[23:13:00] <andreyorst> I think I saw something like this in Sly
[23:13:16] <andreyorst> maybe not keywords, but some minor modes
[23:13:39] <technomancy> I guess the underlying assumption there is that syntax highlighting for 3rd-party libraries is a good idea... to me syntax highlighting is used as a tool to make sure I'm spelling built-in constructs correctly.
[23:14:11] <technomancy> it would be a bit unsettling to see a macro that comes from a library show up in the same face as a special form
[23:14:19] *** Joins: mfiano (~mfiano@li1282-157.members.linode.com)
[23:14:26] <andreyorst> while yes, highlighting macros seems kinda important. Even if not for highlighting, then for indentation
[23:15:01] <andreyorst> well, macros are no different from special forms in the regard that they treat arguments specially..
[23:15:28] <technomancy> they're quite different in provenance though; special forms come from "nowhere" while macros are imported lexically
[23:15:47] <andreyorst> yeah, that's a valid concern
