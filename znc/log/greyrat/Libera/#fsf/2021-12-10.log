[04:45:29] <tpefreedom> And replicant isn't an option
[04:45:49] <tpefreedom> and the librem 5 is way too expensive (idk if it would even work w/ verizon's network)
[04:46:07] <tpefreedom> So then what is my next best option?
[04:50:06] <DiffieHellman> Not using version?

[04:53:42] <tpefreedom> I'm not sure whether I'd be able to yet.
[04:53:55] <gry> do you have pocket cash
[04:54:09] <tpefreedom> yes
[04:54:11] <gry> i got my first mobile plan for ten bucks by walking into a shop, i needed a photo id and a note
[04:54:44] <gry> as far as i remember they didn't even need to post anything, they just gave me a sim card straight away
[04:54:52] <gry> it was pre-paid
[04:55:18] <gry> so i pay for as much as i use. if i don't use it, i don't need to pay much, only a bare minimum to keep the service active
[04:55:36] <gry> though my personal preference is towards not having a mobile, i prefer landline internet now
[04:55:49] <gry> a sim card is just easier to get independently
[04:56:02] <tpefreedom> I'm not sure if the pinephone is ready for daily use without having to do a lot of maintainance.
[04:57:58] <tpefreedom> I don't want to get stuck with a broken phone and no quick way to fix it.
[04:59:19] <tpefreedom> I was thinking of buying a refurbished phone and flashing a degoogled rom when I first get it.
[05:01:13] <tpefreedom> Which pinephone distros are the most usable?
[05:02:14] <gry> people in #pinephone might know better, though it's such a tiny channel that 2-3 days wait without closing the chat might be required
[05:02:45] <tpefreedom> What do you use?
[05:04:16] <gry> i use phones from a bin so to speak - something a friend was going to recycle, but the 3G is still on, so i grab it and keep using ancient devices until they break down completely
[05:05:03] <gry> personally i like pinephones, they have a switch to disable mic, but i highly dislike the fact that cellular chip is the same both for phone calls and for mobile data
[05:05:24] <gry> in my view this is a security risk, if the OS has a backdoor, it means any mobile phone can send data anywhere over internet
[05:06:01] <gry> but then, some phones silently sms'ed data without showing the sms to the user
[05:06:51] <gry> basically even a landline phone if it has a backdoor can easily deliver my phone call history to someone else, without my permission
[05:08:07] <tpefreedom> The pinephone distros and the major degoogled android roms seem pretty similar in terms of freedom. They most nonfree software but still are not completely free/libre (drivers/firmware and a few other random nonfree programs).
[05:08:23] <tpefreedom> I wish replicant worked on newer devices but it doesn't.
[05:08:48] <gry> you don't need newer device
[05:08:50] <gry> not for phone
[05:09:51] <tpefreedom> I have no idea where to find carrier support for 2g or 3g that would last more than a year or two more.
[05:10:13] <gry> let me get it right
[05:10:20] <gry> you have internet at home from your parents

[05:17:21] <tpefreedom> An upgrade over my current 5+ year old phone. it works as a simple phone IG but there are other things I use it for other things (like music, or being able to quickly look something up or check my email or matrix account or also playing some games.)
[05:17:45] <tpefreedom> It is much more efficient than having several dedicated devices for different purposes.
[05:18:15] <gry> do you even own a laptop
[05:19:09] <tpefreedom> Yes
[05:19:17] <tpefreedom> But mobile data can be verry useful
[05:19:52] <gry> why/when/where
[05:19:58] <gry> music you can download at home
[05:20:05] <gry> listen later
[05:20:13] <tpefreedom> for example, my school has filters on the wifi that sometimes block things as random as the replicant website. I trry to look up replicant devices while I have some free time and it's blocked.
[05:20:30] <gry> so do it at home
[05:20:40] <gry> at school do more study time or someother that they allow
[05:20:46] <gry> also, download all replicant website to your device
[05:20:57] <gry> it might be easier than it sounds

[09:13:57] <fossdev> Isn't today meeting
[09:16:03] <bandali> the fsf directory meeting? i believe so; it should begin about 11 hours from now
[09:18:41] <fossdev> Thats right
[09:21:37] <fossdev> I don't think most new free software even care about fsf
[09:24:01] <gry> someone could go through recently new added projects at github, gitlab, others
[09:24:10] <gry> and show them how to add copyright headers to their files
[09:24:16] <gry> many of them dont even know what software licence is
[09:24:35] <gry> and once they do everything right, if they dont have non-free deps, list them in the directory
[09:24:42] <gry> potentially this process could be automated
[09:25:21] <gry> and even more - this script could go as far as make a mirror of the repository, if a human says it passed
[09:25:32] <gry> currently the fsf directory might have a number of broken links
[09:25:43] <fossdev> gry: most of developers don't even care about implementation of license in proper way
[09:26:11] <gry> right, hence the suggestion
[09:26:51] <fossdev> How we talk to them if they don't join us
[09:28:28] <fossdev> Do u going to talk to them on github or gitlab
[09:29:32] <fossdev> 99 % of free software somehow linked to companies
[09:29:50] <fossdev> And they control them

[21:03:04] <myrcy> There is some discussion on the Rust page that would be nice to get addressed
[21:03:15] <craigt> myrcy: It just started.
[21:03:23] <craigt> myrcy: Glad you could make it.
[21:03:41] <myrcy> oh nice, yes I'll make sure and stick around then
[21:04:31] <myrcy> I need to go in and edit a few of the entries I made, I think I may have accidentally only linked the main repository for a few of them and not other repos used for the source code
[21:06:44] <myrcy> Warning behind Bitwarden's license as well: https://directory.fsf.org/wiki/Talk:Bitwarden especially considering they often get listed as "free and open source"
[21:08:31] <tfisgnag> craigt: This week, while I was reviewing what we had done since we began studying Mailvelope's entry in the Directory (and unintentionally rm my log of Nov 26's meeting ) I was wondering if (in real life) what we almost did with the data of line 33 (of what we had greped) should also be done with lines 2 through 13 (both included); 32; 34; 42; 48
[21:08:32] <tfisgnag> through 60(both included); 131; 191 through 193  (both included).
[21:09:12] <Noisytoot> tfisgnag, What are these line numbers?
[21:10:00] <craigt> tfisgnag: Yes. I don't think I see the line numbers the same way you are seeing them.
[21:10:18] <craigt> Noisytoot: Hello! Welcome back to the FSD meeting.

[21:29:07] <tfisgnag> craigt: When we  "grep -R Copyright" the contents of mailvelope-4.4.1 folder, the reply we got on the CLI was a 193 line response. Last Friday we worked on the contents of line 33.  But the contents of the lines I named  a while ago were lines that didn't show something like "Copyright (C) 20??-?? Mailvelope GmbH" in them. I was wondering if
[21:29:07] <tfisgnag> what we had done with the data of line 32 should also be done with those other lines.

[21:32:00] <craigt> tfisgnag: We were looking for any line that did not say, "Mailvelope GmbH" and we found "The Closure Library Authors." We want to include that author and the license on the FSD entry for Mailvelope.

[21:54:46] <tfisgnag> craigt: Yes, we were looking for lines that didn't say "Mailvelope GmbH" and we found on line 33 (of the CLI ) "The Closure Library Authors". You suggested I should enter some data related to that in the "Licence" subtab of the "Edit with form" tab. I did that and that data was there during these last 6 days but I can't find it now.
[21:55:18] <craigt> tfisgnag: checking...
[21:56:25] <craigt> tfisgnag: Ah! Your changes have to be approved by an administrator.

[22:03:12] <tfisgnag> Because the other lines I have mentioned today also lack of "Mailvelope GmbH" on them, I was wondering if I should try to do the same with them.

[23:57:00] <myrcy> I'll try and run the software recommended earlier to check if everything is correct but the current entry I have created should include all necessary information as well
