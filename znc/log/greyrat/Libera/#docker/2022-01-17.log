[01:06:41] <moo> COPY Gemfile Gemfile.lock vendor ./

[01:06:58] <moo> but ok that seems like easy fix, thanks
[01:07:15] <Abdullah> so I wrote my first Dockerfile. and I want to start nginx on boot in a debian image. But debian image I have had no systemd. so I also instructed it to install systemd. but now it says system hasn't booted with systemd yet. 
[01:07:30] <LordKalma> that line would yield ./Gemfile ./Gemfile.lock ./vendor/[...]
[01:07:33] <LordKalma> (iirc)
[01:07:45] <Abdullah> Synchronizing state of nginx.service with SysV service script with /lib/systemd/systemd-sysv-install.
[01:07:46] <Abdullah> Executing: /lib/systemd/systemd-sysv-install enable nginx
[01:07:48] <Abdullah> System has not been booted with systemd as init system (PID 1). Can't operate.

[01:07:52] <Abdullah> The command '/bin/sh -c systemctl enable --now nginx.service' returned a non-zero code: 1
[01:08:07] <LordKalma> Abdullah, not really an answer, but you can always use the nginx as the base image :)
[01:08:08] <ikke> Abdullah: docker containers are not full systems that you boot with an init process
[01:08:32] <ikke> Abdullah: you start a single process in a container, which most of the time is the actual thing you want to have running

[01:09:15] <ikke> https://hub.docker.com/_/nginx
[01:09:22] <LordKalma> in fact, if you're building a stack with like docker-compose, it's so easy to use nginx

[01:09:52] <Abdullah> I also need git 
[01:10:00] <LordKalma> image: nginx:stable and volumes: some_config_file :D 
[01:10:01] <Abdullah> to fetch source code of app
[01:10:45] <LordKalma> hum, in that case I would start with a Dockerfile with `FROM nginx:stable` and apt install git inside it
[01:10:55] <ikke> I would not do that
[01:11:14] <LordKalma> yeah, I wouldn't do that approach
[01:11:18] <ikke> A separate container could take care care of that and copy the source in the shared volume

[14:35:50] <moo> so i have an awful webapp that loves to get stuck, hang, crash, burn the whole village etc. do you think it makes sense to make eg. 2-4 installs of it and add each separately to docker-compose + then add some loadbalancer? 
[14:36:34] <moo> i don't think there is an automatic option to tell docker-compose how many copies of given service to spawn right
[14:38:26] <moo> i guess there is -p but doesn't make sense to me in this case
[14:40:37] <rawtaz> Tuor: if you create a volume for it it should just work. are you sure youre not making a bind mount?
[14:43:42] <rawtaz> moo: are you saying it dies at random intervals? docker restarts (depending on configuration though) the process that runs in a container when it dies, and you can also configure the health checks it should use to determine when to restart, so perhaps you can just have one container restarting when needed?
[14:44:02] <moo> sometimes it just hangs process forever and needs to be killed. its really awful lol
[14:49:05] <rawtaz> fun. what is it that hangs?
[14:50:04] <rawtaz> here's an unofficial example of using HEALTHCHECK: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/docker-healthcheck-instruction/
[14:50:20] <rawtaz> as you see you can do pretty much whatever you want, should be doable to check if it no longer replies i guess

[15:22:00] <rawtaz> Tuor: so what are you actually asking, im not sure i get it.. in your container you should now have that volume mounted on that path - cant you use it? you should be able to use it like any other filesystem basically. and i presume you are to create the keys inside the container?

[15:40:15] <rawtaz> Tuor: then obviously you need to just reconfigure the ownership and permissions? like on any other filesystem
[15:40:46] <rawtaz> you'd need to use the firewall for that i think. or perhaps if you use the host network type (im not sure)

[19:15:29] <rawtaz> Masklin_Gurder: you probably need to clarify your question. give a concrete example
[19:15:41] <rawtaz> rvalue: yes, and depending on the restart policy restart it or not
[19:15:45] <rvalue> i want to make some changes to files with all the settings set correctly in the running container and then restart the container and have it running
[19:24:21] <Sqaure> anyone know if its easy to have a bunch of applications running on amazon for periods - not all the time. I guess i wonder if theres some inherent cumbersomeness of deploy/remove (as in start / top paying for the service?)
[19:24:45] <rawtaz> rvalue: so do that
[19:24:52] <rawtaz> rvalue: nothing wrong with restarting a container
[19:25:22] <rawtaz> Sqaure: not sure what youre really asking.
[19:25:54] <rawtaz> easy is relative. yes you can have apps running on aws when and how long you want. cumbersome is relative, but yes it does require work to deploy them obviously.
[19:26:06] <rawtaz> paying, i guess you simply get an invoice and they charge your CC
[19:26:49] <Sqaure> rawtaz, so you cant pause your apps for extended periods of time? Once you stop paying everything is deleted?

[19:28:18] <rawtaz> you pay for what you use. if you dont run a server you dont pay for it. if you despite that want to keep the data for the server instead of redeploying that, you pay for it.
[19:28:46] <rawtaz> you need to look at your needs and requirements and stack to determine which of the many AWS services are applicable to your user csae
[19:28:50] <rawtaz> -r
[19:29:36] <Sqaure> ah ok. You dont happen to know what it would cost *very roughly* to have 3-4 dormant docker images (700meg-ish each) per month? 
[19:30:10] <Sqaure> (id be paying from my own pocket)
[19:31:23] <rawtaz> haha nope :D i still havent blown my head off by looking too deeply in the pricing at amazon :) but they do have a nice cost calculator that i recommend, its good
[19:31:39] <rawtaz> i looked at some server pricing last night with it and gave up when it turned out that they were more expensive than the alternative

[22:44:34] <rawtaz> can someone confirm that the -m memory limit (e.g. from docker run) is for resident memory? i have a container which has mem_limit:512m in the compose file and i see it's using 796872 virtual and 77428 resident memory, hence the memory limit can presumably not be for virtual.

[23:09:14] <molt> hey all. I'm pretty new to Docker and could use some help. I set up a container for something called Apache Guacamole. It works great, but realized that I should have set it up on a macvlan instead of a bridge -- that way I can use the WoL magic packets the application uses to wake up remote machines. How can I do this? I've been failing miserably...
[23:12:02] <molt> I tried just changing the network on the container after stopping it. No 's joy. I tried recreating the container (via Portainer's "Duplicate/Edit" option), but with the macvlan instead of the bridge and I get an error.

[23:18:03] <yuesbeez> I have created a simple dockerfile with two lines: 'FROM quay.io/fedora/fedora:35' and 'RUN ["/bin/bash", "-c", "dnf update -y"]' which is failing with 'The command '/bin/bash -c dnf update -y' returned a non-zero code: 1. Please fix the Dockerfile and try again..'. However this command works if I start the image with docker run and run the command manually. How do i get it working in the dockerfile?
[23:19:49] <rawtaz> s17: well there are more than those as well. but thats probably besides the point
