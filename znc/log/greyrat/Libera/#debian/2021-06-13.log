[15:06:00] <PMT> "New functionality" and "bugfix" are not the same thing.
[15:08:49] <velix> I know, that's why I was comparing it to Enterprise LTSC. Just bug- and security fixes.
[15:10:22] <PMT> AIUI from outside, the threshold for LTSC patching something is much higher.
[15:10:44] <velix> hmm... can I usermod a normal user to a shell user?
[15:11:00] <velix> or is it easier just to edit /etc/passwd?
[15:11:20] <PMT> What exactly do you think you couldn't do with usermod?
[15:12:20] <velix> PMT: usermod seems to set "shell", so setting it to /usr/sbin/nologin might work.
[15:12:24] <velix> Thx
[15:12:25] <velix> thanks*
[15:12:42] <PMT> I would not advise manually editing passwd unless you have literally no other choice. 
[15:13:33] <PMT> I'm also now quite unclear on what you want to do, since I assumed you meant "absolutely unprivileged user" into "user with a valid shell".

[16:08:12] <shtrb> Would teams flatpak really have access to WiFi network name,  mac address and hostname ? 
[16:09:47] <PMT> What are you basing this question on?
[16:12:04] <shtrb> Microsoft Teams privacy terms where they cover Wifi network name, hardware identifiers etc

[16:14:33] <shtrb> I'm trying to see the link that I was proivded now , with not much success 
[16:15:37] <ratrace> I suppose that's a generic Teams ToS because on windows it surely would have access to all that.
[16:16:12] <shtrb> But now I'm intrigued if they have technical way to access that over flatpak (user installation) 
[16:16:33] <shtrb> And good day ratrace , long time no see
[16:16:34] <ratrace> It's also possible the flatpak would have access to that info as well, if a portal exists. But I see no reason to permit the pak any kind of (dbus I assume) interaction with NM, the supplicant, or whatever else
[16:16:45] <jhutchins> shtrb: Teams would need access to network configuration info in order to be functional.
[16:16:51] *** grit_ is now known as grit
[16:17:11] <ratrace> jhutchins: but why? is that something baked into Teams?
[16:17:20] <ratrace> ie, just opening a tcp socket to a server isn't enough?
[16:17:35] <jhutchins> ratrace: Yes, it's a network application.  Without the network it's useless.
[16:17:51] <ratrace> that doesn't make any sense
[16:18:07] <ratrace> opening a tcp socket ("using the network") does not require access to _configuration_
[16:18:12] <shtrb> This is the basic teams flatpak perm list : http://paste.debian.net/1201059/
[16:18:41] <ratrace> and the networking stack on linux is such that, this being a namespace, the "localhost" info would be specific to the namespace, unless host is exposed
[16:19:01] <shtrb> jhutchins, do you mean they know your ip address (doh !) or do you mean actual access to the config (MAC address, WiFi name , etc) ? 
[16:19:39] <ratrace> at the very least, it _should_ be possible to anonymize all that with the namespace, even if the pak in question doesn't

[20:58:02] <ratrace> the openzfs docs, debian specific section, are a better sauce imho
[20:58:16] <PMT> I've never read that wiki page, so I can't comment.
[20:58:49] <ratrace> but if you're familiar with ZFS already, there's nothing specific here except:  a) DKMS  and b) how all that integrates with initramfs for root on ZFS
[20:59:08] <PMT> It seems like someone might want to annotate the wiki page to note that even if you make a v28 pool it's still not interoperable with Oracle ZFS because they broke something.
[21:00:09] <PMT> There also aren't enough flashing warnings around using dedup on there.
[21:00:50] <evilbug> so gotta enable backports for zfs on deb...

[23:16:04] <ratrace> the question is also: why. People can be very wrong too. Like Linus did when he slammed ZFS oblivious to teh fact that OracleZFS != OpenZFS. Or people might have.... agendas.... like GKH has when he inanely, like a spoiled brat, wants to stick it to the long dead company and retaliate by hating ZFS.
[23:17:17] <ratrace> Sun^W <long dead company> didn't like linux. oh yeah? so now we're gonna show them alright and prevent ZFS from working on Linux wherever possible.
[23:17:51] <PMT> Certainly. Most questions about legality are just an opinion until it's taken to court. 
[23:19:16] <ratrace> indeed.
[23:20:01] <ratrace> but the only thing that could go to court here is the question of copyrights and patents.   redistributing zfs kmod simply isn't against GPL. None of the GPL-only APIs are being violated, ZFS worked around those.
