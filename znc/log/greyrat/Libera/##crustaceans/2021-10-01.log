[00:14:18] <dimadima> devault
[00:14:54] <dimadima> i like how it's packaged for macOS and SUSE
[00:14:57] <dimadima> that's pretty specific
[00:16:49] <dimadima> i guess there are flatpaks too
[00:16:59] <dimadima> big netsplit today
[00:18:31] <dimadima> that guy basically looks like he's sleeping in a hammock
[00:20:24] <dimadima> i've alway wondered if hammocks are good on the back
[00:27:56] <riv> i can't imagine that they are *good* for the back
[00:28:58] <riv> google seems to be split on it
[00:58:42] <manicennui> I confirmed with my manager that I would be eligible to work remotely forever if I wanted.
[00:58:56] <n3t> nice
[01:00:14] <manicennui> Sounds like management and HR are also talking about our overall compensation levels and perks.
[01:00:48] <manicennui> We've been without many of the perks for 18+ months now, and compensation for software engineers has jumped in the last couple of years and we haven't really kept up.
[01:00:59] <bkero> Nowhere ever keeps up
[01:01:04] <bkero> That's why you need to jump ship
[01:01:30] <manicennui> I've been getting 5-6% more per year, so I haven't been unhappy.
[01:02:07] <manicennui> And the years I was promoted I got a raise for the promotion and still received a year end raise, which made it more like 8-12% in those years.
[01:03:02] <manicennui> But I know people in Chicago getting base salaries that are 15%+ above what I'm making for Rails nonsense now.
[01:04:19] <manicennui> I still might leave regardless of what they do, but I'll do it in the spring after we get our raises and bonuses.
[01:04:43] <manicennui> Plus some of my RSUs will vest.

[01:35:30] <dimadima> doesn't talk, it swears
[01:35:51] <dimadima> if you don't feel like switching jobs, you could ask them for a bigger bump?
[01:36:06] <manicennui> I'm not really worried about that.
[01:36:18] <manicennui> Whether I leave will boil down to how much longer I want to deal with Ruby/Go.
[01:36:39] <dimadima> ah
[01:36:42] <manicennui> This job would be good if I wanted to try to start something on the side too.
[01:36:59] <manicennui> There is no chance that I'd compete with them, and they aren't demanding.
[01:37:16] <dimadima> like a consulting thing?
[01:37:43] <manicennui> Nah.
[01:38:17] <manicennui> Some kind of small company that may or may not do software.
[01:38:44] <dimadima> what is there besides software
[01:38:49] <dimadima> ...hardware?
[01:39:00] <manicennui> Some people buy things other than software.
[01:39:04] <manicennui> Silly people.
[01:39:06] <dimadima> like hardware
[01:39:16] <manicennui> I meant non-computer things.
[01:39:19] <dimadima> :)
[01:39:29] <manicennui> I honestly rather write software for a non-software company.

[02:12:34] <dimadima> trying to find public domain media to use in screenshots is difficult. first, it seems like most cool things are not in the public domain
[02:12:42] <dimadima> cool as in, appealing in app screeshots
[02:12:49] <dimadima> second, i just get distracted looking at cool things
[02:13:01] <dimadima> turns out there are literally no audio recordings in the public domain in the united states
[02:13:18] <dimadima> by virtue of how copyright law for audio recordings evolved
[02:13:41] <dimadima> but i did find tons of cool stuff like this https://archive.org/details/@paris-portland
[02:13:43] <buttsbot> User Account
[02:16:58] <dimadima> tons of audio recordings appear to be in the public domain, but it appears that it's just because no one takes action to pursue infringement
[02:18:28] <dimadima> Whether or not there are sound recordings in the public domain is a difficult question for a whole host of reasons, but the short answer is that it’s safest to assume that there are no sound recordings in the public domain. In reality, there probably are a few. But sound recording rights are tangled up in both state and federal law and require expert research into those laws to determine the
[02:18:34] <dimadima> status of a recording.

[02:27:08] <dimadima> what kind of assets are those? i'm looking more for, like, art like this https://i.imgur.com/dQ4MR65.png
[02:27:32] <dimadima> the first image i thought was from 1925 but thats when the book was from and the image itself is from the 30s and not PD
[02:27:37] <manicennui> Shots of other people's software?
[02:27:46] <dimadima> that's my software?
[02:28:03] <manicennui> So take more photos?
[02:28:08] <dimadima> with media that infringes unfrotateunly

[03:17:46] <dimadima> whats the deal with the yakuza
[03:18:52] <manicennui> All of my yakuza knowledge is from movies.
[03:23:04] <dimadima> Sakamoto days looks funny but what's a hitman in japan? small business or part of a larger organization? same as in the west?
[03:23:44] <dimadima> some people just can't not try and kill somebody?
[03:24:25] <manicennui> I assume same as the West more or less.

[07:59:29] <buttsbot> - Login • Instagram -
[08:00:23] <dimadima> hmm i'm not sure what kind of music that is
[08:00:40] <dimadima> maybe i said metal? i meant more like black metal, scandanavian metal
[08:00:56] <dimadima> less high pitched screaming
[08:01:03] <manicennui> Ah.
[08:01:05] <dimadima> more death
[08:01:17] <manicennui> Opeth?
[08:02:11] <dimadima> never heard of them. i don't actually know much about metal, just enjoy listenign to it sometimes
[08:03:25] <dimadima> i like this album for example https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaMbKZPBruU
[08:03:26] <buttsbot> Electric Wizard - Dopethrone (2000) full album - YouTube - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaMbKZPBruU
[08:04:30] <manicennui> This is decent.
[08:04:51] <dimadima> i'd like to have more time to explore this kind of music and psychadelic rock/metal in general. but over the last 5-10 years i've mostly been listening to classical/jazz/ragtime and shit like that
[08:05:05] <dimadima> yeah i really enjoy metal like that
[08:06:11] <manicennui> This band is hilarious, but their music isn't great: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gorgoroth
[08:06:12] <buttsbot> Gorgoroth - Wikipedia
[08:06:19] <manicennui> I just like how fucked up they are.
[08:06:58] <manicennui> "On February 1, 2004, during a concert being recorded for a DVD in Kraków, Poland, the band displayed sheep heads on stakes, a bloodbath of 80 litres of sheep's blood, Satanic symbols, and four naked crucified models on stage. A police investigation took place with allegations of religious offence (which is prosecutable under Polish law) and cruelty to animals."
[08:07:52] <dimadima> heh youtube knows me so well. up next it recommended https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WNxnQ39b38
[08:07:53] <buttsbot> Sleep - Holy Mountain [Full Album | 1992] - YouTube - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WNxnQ39b38
[08:08:31] <dimadima> jeeez
[08:09:45] <dimadima> i wish i hadn't stopped being able to think while listening to music. its made it impossible for me to listen to music while working
[08:10:24] <manicennui> Yeah, I can't really listen to anything while I program.
[08:10:47] <dimadima> heh youtube man, i think i meant to link that sleep album, sent electric wizard by accident
[08:10:55] <manicennui> I don't know how people listen to music and read either.
[08:10:55] <dimadima> but lo and behold, youtube knows all
[08:11:26] <dimadima> i have no idea either. as a kid i could do that. but maybe around age... 18 or 20 it just switched off
[08:12:01] <dimadima> there's a good chance i wasn't intellectually challenged until that age heh
[08:12:14] <dimadima> and nothing actually changed
[08:12:48] * dimadima finds full Gorgoroth album
[08:13:33] <dimadima> heh this sounds pretty evil and not as stoned as i would like
[08:13:37] <dimadima> :)
[08:14:01] <dimadima> i saw the melvins i think at the aragon ballroom
[08:14:19] <manicennui> I recommend Opeth, but their albums are all different.
[08:14:38] <manicennui> So you might have to listen to a few of them to find one you like.
[08:14:53] * dimadima pulls up opeth
[08:15:03] <dimadima> heh the melvins played the empty bottle in june 2020
[08:15:08] <dimadima> who played shows in june 2020!??!
[08:15:32] <manicennui> I saw Los Campesinos at Empty Bottle. One of my favorite shows ever.
[08:15:34] <dimadima> also crazy is i am thinking about shows i went to and my i suddenly started smelling that stale beer smell
[08:16:13] <manicennui> heh
[08:16:24] <manicennui> I think smell is one of our strongest memory triggers.
[08:16:51] <dimadima> exactly, but this was the other way around!
[08:17:03] <dimadima> i'm not sure that's ever happened
[08:17:41] <dimadima> here's a jam that is decidedly not metal https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qlk8QlRsyII
[08:17:42] <buttsbot> múm - Smell Memory - YouTube - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qlk8QlRsyII
[08:17:56] <dimadima> (not ever happened to me, obviously)
[08:18:44] <dimadima> not sure it's a jam per se, but we can let that live
[08:18:45] <dimadima> :)
[08:19:18] <dimadima> will get back to opeth in a sec, this song distracted me
[08:19:49] <manicennui> That brought this to mind: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OaO81kL6EM
[08:19:49] <buttsbot> Tunng - Bullets [Official Video] - YouTube - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OaO81kL6EM
[08:20:51] <manicennui> There are a lot of weird sounds later in the song.
[08:31:39] <dimadima> that's a nice song
[08:32:57] <dimadima> i can't remember if i've ever heard this band tunng
[08:36:12] <dimadima> yeah opeth is nice too
[08:51:44] <dimadima> i didnt know bands were playing shows in july 2020

[13:43:55] <Brekkjern> Well, Lobste.rs is the only thing everyone on the site has in common, so it's not that weird that announcements get a lot of engagements

[16:27:44] <dimadima> my irssi stopped working at some point last night
[16:31:39] <dimadima> did libera make sasl required recently? as in https://libera.chat/guides/sasl
[16:31:39] <buttsbot> Using SASL | Libera Chat
[16:32:16] <Brekkjern> That would become difficult as you need to connect to Libera first to register an account
[16:32:25] <Brekkjern> So you are stuck in a dependency loop to get that done
[16:33:01] <dimadima> yeah :/
[16:33:57] <dimadima> i was running irssi on google cloud so maybe they added it go sasl required ranges "Some IP address ranges are configured to require SASL authentication to an existing NickServ account with a verified email address. "
[16:34:20] <dimadima> but then i tried from my local ISP (comcast) and same thing happened
[16:34:30] <dimadima> maybe a cert issue with irssi?
[16:34:59] <Brekkjern> Maybe, or maybe they are seeing abuse from some ranges you connect through and are now requiring SASL from them to limit it.
[16:35:18] <dimadima> both google cloud and my local comcast?
[16:35:30] <Brekkjern> I mean... It's possible...
[16:35:56] <Brekkjern> Not saying it's likely :P
[16:36:12] <dimadima> yeah. i'd never tried connecting to libera directly from my home IP until last night. so who knows. will have to investigate further

[16:44:23] <gwozniak> Finally got a good night's sleep
[16:45:02] <gwozniak> Woke up at 3:30am yesterday and was pretty tired
[16:45:08] <Brekkjern> That sucks :S
[16:45:29] <gwozniak> I hate it when I wake up like that and then can't get back to sleep
[16:45:38] <gwozniak> Then I just stay up and I'm really tired
[16:46:52] <Brekkjern> I kinda have the opposite problem. I just can't sleep until rather late :S
[16:49:11] <indigo> I have both problems sometimes :D wooo
[16:49:28] <indigo> Glad to hear you got some sleep though gwozniak
[16:49:35] <gwozniak> I usually go to sleep a little before midnight
[16:49:49] <gwozniak> And typically wake up at 6:30
[16:50:58] <indigo> That’s not a lot of sleep! I try to aim for at least 8 hours
[16:51:27] <indigo> I guess everyone is different in that respect
[16:52:52] <Brekkjern> Yeah
[16:53:52] <Brekkjern> I should sleep before 1 am if I am to be at work at a reasonable hour, but I rarely fall asleep before 2:30 :S
[16:56:02] <gwozniak> indigo: 7 hours is optimal for me. More than that and I get a bit groggy
[16:56:40] <gwozniak> I can get by on 5 hours for a couple of days in a row, but then I crash for a good 8-10 the next day
[16:57:36] <Brekkjern> I've had a period lately where I haven't gotten more than 4 hours a night :S That was harsh...
[16:57:47] <indigo> Gotcha
[16:58:01] <gwozniak> That pretty much knocks me out these days :)
[16:58:02] <indigo> Oof that’s horrible Brekkjern
[16:58:13] <gwozniak> Yeah, 4 hours is pretty low
[16:58:22] <gwozniak> Hope you manage to get some rest soon
[16:58:36] <Brekkjern> It's somewhat better now
[16:58:48] <gwozniak> oh good
[16:59:13] <indigo> Do you filter the blue light from your screen at night?
[16:59:14] <Brekkjern> I sleep longer, but I don't feel as rested as I should :(
[16:59:31] <Brekkjern> I don't use my devices when I go to bed.
[16:59:43] <gwozniak> Really don't understand why this library decides to use integer registers when the hardware supports floating point registers...
[16:59:48] <gwozniak> Anywho...
[17:00:00] <gwozniak> Same as Brekkjern
[17:00:27] <indigo> It might help even an hour before bed
[17:01:04] <indigo> Lol, is it emulating fp in software??
[17:03:01] <prussian> big biz. my current manager came from a place that made libraries for just that.
[17:04:56] <gwozniak> indigo: yes, but you need an fp library when the hardware doesn't have a floating point unit.  When you do have one, though, the compiler will put floats into the floating point registers for function calls
[17:06:07] <gwozniak> Good, and small, floating point libraries are very hard to write
[17:07:31] <gwozniak> Writing in assembly is not at all uncommon in that world
[17:08:55] <indigo> Makes sense
[17:09:55] <gwozniak> ABIs are messy
[17:11:36] <gwozniak> integer, float, vector arguments being passed in different registers makes for complicated codegen
[17:12:16] <gwozniak> It's very much a case of the concept being fairly straightforward, but the details being rather overwhelming
[17:13:02] <gwozniak> C++'s exception stuff makes it more complicated (and something I have yet to dive into)
[17:16:39] <indigo> Thankfully we have C++ exceptions turned off at work
[17:18:27] <gwozniak> We generally avoid exceptions and RTTI

[21:27:10] <manicennui> They are just authorities that can't be questioned.
[21:27:25] <dimadima> or even studied, for that matter

[21:31:59] <dimadima> i don't think it was like that prior to nixon
[21:32:06] <manicennui> I do.
[21:32:07] <dimadima> nixon was really the turning point, in my understanding
[21:32:13] <manicennui> I think most of the Founding Fathers were also shitheads.
[21:32:21] <manicennui> Our entire history is atrocious.
[21:32:32] <dimadima> isn't history in general atrocious
[21:32:33] <manicennui> Humans just aren't good at this stuff.
[21:32:48] <manicennui> dimadima: Sure, but we pretend like the US is this amazing place.

[21:35:00] <manicennui> If you say so.
[21:35:38] <manicennui> I think that's just a nice lie we tell ourselves because genetics are so unfair.
[21:36:23] <dimadima> genetics are unfair but i think "wild type" humans are all about the same
[21:36:34] <manicennui> Wild type?

[21:38:29] <dimadima> manicennui: that's a strawman
[21:38:32] <dimadima> definitely not a genius
[21:39:00] <manicennui> So you believe the only differences are extreme?
[21:39:00] <prussian> what, me worry?
[21:39:05] <prussian> that's me.
[21:39:21] <dimadima> but i reason it the opposite way, that there's no way to tell realyl given that most people don't even get a chance
[21:39:33] <manicennui> That's not what I'm saying.
[21:39:47] <dimadima> yeah my take is that the differences are in the 4th-6ths sigmas
[21:40:03] <manicennui> Unless you mean "a chance of being extremely intelligent".
[21:40:15] <dimadima> a chance at developing themselves
[21:40:34] <manicennui> They can develop in many ways, and might be better people than those who are much more intelligent.
[21:40:34] <dimadima> but i guess i sound like a super asshole now
[21:40:50] <manicennui> But that doesn't mean that extremely intelligence is just a matter of trying hard.
[21:40:59] <manicennui> Nah, I probably sound like the asshole.
[21:41:09] <dimadima> yeah but i don't understand why "Extreme" keeps coming into play
[21:41:17] <dimadima> you don't need extreme intelligence to see through trump
[21:41:18] <manicennui> It's a faux pas for people to acknowledge science when it comes to genetics.
[21:41:36] <dimadima> you need some basic degree of worldliness that these people do not have for some reason
[21:41:43] <dimadima> or some kind of emotional radar or something
[21:41:53] <manicennui> dimadima: I don't know. A lot of Democrats "see through him" for reasons that have nothing to do with rational thought.
[21:41:59] <dimadima> yeah
[21:42:05] <manicennui> I think we are extremely good at rationalizing things.
[21:42:09] <dimadima> anyway i don't want to go to far w/ politics
[21:42:13] <dimadima> nothing good can come of it
[21:42:17] <manicennui> And when we are offered a plausible rationalization, we are eager to take it.
[21:42:35] <manicennui> There are hundreds of reasons to hate Trump.
[21:43:11] <manicennui> I also think the reasons why many people opposed him were not hard to figure out.
[21:43:22] <manicennui> Like he was clearly okay with racist policies.
[21:43:33] <manicennui> For some people that was a pro.
[21:43:37] <manicennui> And for many it was a con.
[21:43:54] <manicennui> And then there are the crazies who tried to pretend like he wasn't being racist.
[21:44:16] <manicennui> I actually don't think he is hardcore racist, but he is fine with racist policies if it helps him.
[21:44:37] <manicennui> At some point, if you commit enough racist acts, you are kind of are hardcore racist though.
[21:44:38] <dimadima> he's just a con
[21:44:47] <dimadima> and a narcissist, first and foremost
[21:44:47] <manicennui> Whether you are internally racist or not.
[21:44:51] <manicennui> Yeah.
[21:45:01] <manicennui> Almost everything he does boils down to his narcissism.
[21:45:10] <dimadima> i think you can drop the "almost"
[21:45:16] <dimadima> he's a reptile
[21:45:58] <dimadima> if people were okay with the disinfectant/UV thing
[21:46:10] <dimadima> putting the racism etc aside
[21:46:28] <dimadima> if people were okay with that, tbh it's hard to process that
[21:46:55] <manicennui> I think that was one of the many cases where he half paid attention to a briefing and then jumbled a bunch of things together when talking.
[21:47:06] <dimadima> whether you think covid is real or fake
[21:47:13] <dimadima> whether you hate immigrants or you don't
[21:47:30] <dimadima> you'd think the disinfectant/UV thing would be some sort of point of no return
[21:47:33] <dimadima> or at least i would
[21:47:39] <manicennui> But that's where the authoritarianism comes in.
[21:47:47] <dimadima> i would think every reasonable person could get behind that being too fucking much
[21:48:00] <dimadima> yeah lol
[21:48:03] <manicennui> This is why religious people indoctrinate children from a young age.
[21:48:08] <dimadima> as he said, he could shoot someone on 5th avenue and get away with it
[21:48:10] <dimadima> he said it himself
[21:48:34] <dimadima> and then steamrolled 17 opponents and become president of this glorious nation
[21:48:40] <manicennui> I'm sure you've felt a bit of this when someone you really respect in the computing field says something that seems questionable.
[21:48:52] <manicennui> At first you might second guess yourself because you respect the person.
[21:49:00] <manicennui> But imagine if it went far deeper than that.
[21:49:06] <manicennui> This person is your source of truth.
[21:49:28] <manicennui> They aren't simply giving their opinion.
[21:49:35] <manicennui> And they can't be wrong.
[21:49:55] <manicennui> The only possibilities are that they are right or you misunderstand.
[21:50:17] <dimadima> i'm just sad my inlaws are in this cult
[21:50:22] <dimadima> i feel really bad for my wife
[21:50:30] <manicennui> Same reason why most religious people don't read their religious texts and take the word of their religious leaders.
[21:50:45] <companion_cube> the most impressive thing is that he fucked up so badly he wasn't reelected
[21:50:48] <companion_cube> even with the electoral college
[21:51:00] <dimadima> yeah epic fail
[21:51:28] <manicennui> companion_cube: I was more afraid of the fact that it looked like someone at some level of government might help him steal the election.
[21:51:39] <manicennui> Some members of Congress certainly tried.
[21:52:15] <manicennui> If Democrats ran great candidates I think they'd win most of the time.
[21:52:33] <manicennui> They have to rely on people being unhappy enough with the Republican in office to get them to go out and vote.

[21:52:50] *** Joins: jess (~jess@libera/staff/jess)
[21:52:54] <manicennui> And I think there are great Democrats who can win, even ignoring people like Bernie.
[21:53:16] <companion_cube> all behind the AOC train!
[21:53:28] <manicennui> But the DNC seems to want to push people who have "paid their dues" like Hillary and Biden.
[21:53:33] <manicennui> Obama somehow snuck through.
[21:53:43] <manicennui> Kind of amazing that he beat Hilldog.
[21:55:08] <dimadima> she went on record calling "a substantial portion of the population" or however she said it "deplorable" lol
[21:55:16] <dimadima> the DNC beat hilldog
[21:55:19] <dimadima> by running her
[21:55:34] <manicennui> And then they ran her again anyways.
[21:55:45] <manicennui> She was too hated to pull people from the "center".
[21:56:13] <dimadima> how are you a politician who stands in a public space with the video running and call people "Deplorable"?
[21:56:36] <manicennui> dimadima: At the time it wasn't seen as a bad thing.
[21:56:48] <manicennui> The Clintons won in the 90s because of triangulation.
[21:56:48] <dimadima> huh
[21:56:52] <dimadima> at what time
[21:57:11] <manicennui> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangulation_(politics)
[21:57:11] <buttsbot> Triangulation (politics) - Wikipedia
[21:57:21] <dimadima> i'll read that later
[21:57:23] * dimadima gets back to work
[21:57:29] <dimadima> thanks for the link though, i've never heard of that
[21:57:30] <manicennui> They pushed for tough crime laws and limits on welfare.
[21:57:40] <manicennui> To appeal to conservatives.
[21:58:00] <manicennui> Hillary really made Bill president.
[21:58:53] <manicennui> Hillary didn't even support gay marriage until fairly recently (neither did Obama).
[21:59:02] <manicennui> Things have changed a lot in the last decade.
[22:03:16] <manicennui> Hillary was also very hawkish as secretary of state.
[22:03:58] <dimadima> Hillary Rodham Goldwater Clinton, man
[22:04:12] <manicennui> If Republicans were able to think straight, they'd probably support her.
[22:04:13] <dimadima> just another token sociopath
[22:04:20] * dimadima actually goes back to work
[22:42:01] <gwozniak> Office 365 may be obtuse and annoying, but its online group editing capabilities are still better than manually sharing files
[22:42:17] <gwozniak> I was reminded of that today. Very starkly.
[22:42:45] <manicennui> I've been using nothing but Google Docs for years now.
[22:44:12] <mouseghost> ^
[22:44:42] <gwozniak> We use Office 365 here
[22:45:05] <manicennui> I'm sorry.
[22:45:12] <gwozniak> But someone tried to start a group edited presentation by passing around a PPT file
[22:45:32] <gwozniak> So I obliged and, well, it became an online one pretty quickly
[22:45:54] <manicennui> I have to edit a group presentation every other week.
[22:46:00] <manicennui> Fortunately it uses Google Slides.
[22:46:02] <gwozniak> I find Office 365 as annoying as Google Docs and generally try to avoid it when possible
[22:46:11] <gwozniak> But, sometimes you can't
[22:46:45] <manicennui> I find most of my annoyance comes from people trying to use spreadsheets to duplicate information and manage projects with them.
[22:47:28] <gwozniak> I don't see the need for what we're doing to even have a presentation, but it's not a big deal
[22:47:37] <manicennui> Not uncommon to have 2-3 different versions of the same data in different spreadsheets.
[22:48:15] <manicennui> Unfortunately this presentation we do every other week has become part of our ceremonies even though no one has a good reason to keep doing it.
[22:48:28] <manicennui> It's generally over in 20-30 minutes though.
[22:48:46] <gwozniak> That's mercifully short
[22:50:04] <manicennui> Unfortunately we have a meeting right after that with a subset of the people from the previous meeting where we often go over spreadsheets.
[22:50:20] <manicennui> It was really bad a couple of years ago. People were basically reading the spreadsheet out loud.
[22:50:39] <gwozniak> Really, what is the point of that
[22:50:56] <manicennui> I don't know.
[22:51:06] <manicennui> Too many people from super bureaucratic companies.
[22:51:16] <manicennui> The spreadsheet was basically a list of projects and their statuses.
[22:51:24] <manicennui> And they were reading it for the head of product.
[22:51:32] <manicennui> As if he couldn't just read it himself.
[22:52:20] <manicennui> All of these projects are in JIRA, but they still feel the need to duplicate all of that information in multiple spreadsheets.
[22:53:04] <manicennui> This is one of the reasons why I can't go into management.
[22:53:13] <manicennui> I can't spend even more of my time working on useless crap.
[22:53:39] <gwozniak> I'm concerned we're going to be pushed to generate useless metrics soon
[22:54:49] <manicennui> I feel like a lot of that stuff gets done because there are too many people who don't have clear work to do.
[22:55:09] <manicennui> Meaning layers of management.
