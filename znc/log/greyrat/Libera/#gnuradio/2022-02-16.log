[00:06:02] <willcode4[m]> muaddib: After you change the gitbranch in the uhd section of your config file, safest to pybombs remove uhd, which will remove gnuradio and half of everything else. Maybe the default in the recipe is 3.15. I've been overriding it for a while in the config.yml.

[00:14:20] <Zero_Chaos> willcode4[m]: I've been on uhd 4.1 for a long time, I just kept 3.15 in case anything needed it.  At this point, I don't care to maintain it unless someone tells me I should.

[01:37:39] <LordKalma> yes, I know someone was crazy enough to write it
[01:37:46] <LordKalma> oh YOU were
[01:38:03] <LordKalma> how did you cope, really?
[01:38:12] <LordKalma> honest question, sorry for the interview, but I have questions
[01:38:50] <LordKalma> how do you cope with the fact ATSC 3.0 can use TDM, FDM, combination of both, + optionally LDM? 
[01:39:08] <drmpeg> I joined ATSC and obtained the Verification and Validation test files.
[01:39:18] <LordKalma> how do you cope with the fact it might use 503465532 combinations of constellation sizes, and error check sizes
[01:39:28] <LordKalma> it's just insane
[01:39:44] <LordKalma> plus that preamble is really interesting with that cyclic-shift modulation
[01:41:10] <LordKalma> btw, side rant about ATSC 3.0 versus DVB-T2
[01:41:27] <LordKalma> WHYYY did they make the preamble 4.6ish MHz wide?!?!
[01:41:42] <drmpeg> You just use parameters in GNU Radio. https://www.w6rz.net/atsc3tx.png
[01:41:45] <LordKalma> you can have really narrow bandwidth frames, but let's put a wide-af preamble in front
[01:42:09] <LordKalma> DVB-T2 has a narrower preamble iirc, which is good 
[01:42:21] <LordKalma> makes narrower modulation settings actual useful
[01:44:10] <drmpeg> You can't have narrow bandwidth in ATSC 3.0. The lowest sample rate that can be signaled is 6.144 Msps.
[01:44:37] <LordKalma> I stand corrected
[01:45:08] <LordKalma> I probably misread something, or read DVB-T2 and that was what I was remembering
[01:45:51] <drmpeg> In DVB-T2, you can have 5 and 1.7 MHz channels.
[01:46:12] <drmpeg> Along with 6, 7 and 8 MHz.
[01:46:29] <LordKalma> 1.7 seems a really nice hobbyist option :p

[02:16:25] <DerekKozel[m]> I can seriously only try ^^
[02:16:59] <patchvonbraun[m]> These are support ribs for 4 "ParaSlice" antennas for our upcoming synthesis telescope project.
[02:18:21] <patchvonbraun[m]> They worked out so incredibly well in terms of quality that my brain is doing flip-flops on other things I can have the same CNC wood shop work on.
[02:24:22] <patchvonbraun[m]> Basically these will be a 1-lambda-wide "slice" of a parabolic trough, with only a single feed, giving a quite asymmetric notionally elliptic beam.  Allowing an object to stay in the beam for an extended period without having to steer the beam, but squashed in the declination plane down to about 20deg.

[03:15:34] <muaddib[m]> How do you like the MSi SDR?
[03:16:12] <LordKalma> It was a nice thing to have when u didn't have the actual rspdx 
[03:16:45] <LordKalma> Is it as good as an actual rsp1a? No. Is it piracy? Yes. Was it cheap? Yeah. Does it "work"? Yes... 
[03:17:12] <LordKalma> So depends on both your moral compass and performance expectation 
[03:18:29] <LordKalma> It was enough for me to get mad at SDRplay's insane api haha 
[03:21:51] <muaddib[m]> wow. never heard of it.
[03:23:03] <LordKalma> It's an aliexpress clone of the rsp1a
[03:23:19] <muaddib[m]> ah, i see
[03:24:56] <willcode4[m]> Clones firmware too?
[03:25:22] <LordKalma> What do you mean, sorry? 
[03:27:20] <willcode4[m]> Maybe the msi chip is controlled entirely by registers over USB. I was thinking they might have firmware on board.
[03:28:02] <LordKalma> I don't know the underlying architecture. 
[03:28:27] <LordKalma> The clone does show up as a rsp1a as far as SDRplay's api is concerned 
[03:29:03] <willcode4[m]> Do you have a legit rsp to compare hf performance?
[03:29:25] <LordKalma> And SDR Console also lists it under "simple" MSi devices but I never tried actually using it that way 
[03:29:39] <LordKalma> I only have the rspdx but that's a flagship performer 
[03:30:27] <LordKalma> The 1a clone is like... Not good, not terrible either, expect some spurs and expect that money was not put in board quality of heavy filtering haha 
[03:30:28] <willcode4[m]> The 1a and 2 are good. I don't have a dx to compare.
[03:30:53] <LordKalma> The rspdx is really a flagship hf receiver 
[03:31:38] <LordKalma> I'm comfortable recommending that clone to morally flexible half poor people

[13:41:16] <LordKalma> if you have a sin wave in it's positive slope zero, and I added a 180deg phase shift it's go immediately to the negative slope zero and start desceding from there

[13:45:41] <LordKalma> oh, that's just *very* minor artefacts 
[13:47:30] <DerekKozel[m]> Try plotting the output of the phase modulated signal through a Complex to Arg block to see the power. I'd expect that to be a bit more consistent. You're also zoomed very far out in the time domain, so display artifacts are very possible
[13:48:06] <Yamakaja[m]> You mean complex to mag?
[13:48:28] <DerekKozel[m]> Complex to Mag Squared, yes, whoops
[13:48:43] <DerekKozel[m]> Complex to Arg to get your phase input back!
[13:49:28] <DerekKozel[m]> Mag Squared for "power", Mag for "voltage" amplitude
[13:49:35] <DerekKozel[m]> Not enough sleep.
[13:50:16] <LordKalma> honestly it looks just fine
[13:51:12] <LordKalma> but yeah, I noticed the flowchart is plotting re+im 
[13:51:17] <LordKalma> that doesn't make much sense

[13:53:18] <LordKalma> given the rest of the flowchart, what I understand is that re is the left channel, and im is the right channel
[13:53:25] <LordKalma> plotting their sum seems... weird?
[13:53:44] <LordKalma> also I never found a use to plot re+im? I always plot mag and phase when I need something

[13:58:49] <LordKalma> I've had to explain to my engineering colleagues that no, signals over wires can't be complex-valued, so I forgive anybody's intuition haha
[14:01:44] <DerekKozel[m]> See you later. I'm headed into work but people will be around. Are you specifically doing Magnevox AM or the updated C-QUAM?

[14:06:47] <LordKalma> what an interesting architecture
[14:08:08] <LordKalma> PM under AM, so interesting
[14:10:29] <DerekKozel[m]> I hadn't seen sodiraSDR before so had a quick look and found this example of a GNU Radio C-QUAM transmitter that mentions it. I remember someone looking at it about a week ago, was that you reightlabel?
[14:10:29] <DerekKozel[m]> https://github.com/mephitisdeux/cquam
[14:12:28] <reightlabel[m]> <DerekKozel[m]> "See you later. I'm headed into..." <- I have already done a C-QuAM graph, and the same thing with the limiter after quadrature modulation, but I did not like the fact that after limiting the audio information was distorted, and I heard distorted sound in AM mode even when there was no L+R modulation. Now I'm trying Magnavox
[14:12:58] <reightlabel[m]> <DerekKozel[m]> "https://web.archive.org/web/2016..." <- Yes, I studied this manual

[15:15:17] <reightlabel[m]> <DerekKozel[m]> "Cool. When you get them going..." <- In general, it all started with the fact that I found a ready-made C-QuAM graph on GitHub, where the output after quadrature modulation was immediately fed to the transmitter. But this is not correct, since the amplitude of the quadrature signal varies according to the Pythagorean law, and this is a distorted signal relative to the sum of the channels, although this may not be
[15:15:17] <reightlabel[m]> noticed. I didn't like it, and I decided to add a limiter after quadrature modulation, as described in the manual. It didn't get any better, the information was distorted, extraneous artifacts appeared in the spectrum. After that I started trying Magnavox. It was simpler than C-QuAM, there was no need to limit anything, and I began to doubt the viability (maybe another word) of C-QuAM relative to Magnavox. Now I'm still studying
[15:15:17] <reightlabel[m]> Magnavox's work with the SoDiRa receiver.

[17:33:49] <mhilts[m]> s/him/my mentor/
[17:34:28] <drmpeg> Yeah, you often see PRBS sequences used for testing.
[17:35:03] <drmpeg> But it doesn't really affect the operation of the flow.
[17:36:23] <drmpeg> There's already a scrambler block. Even if you input a TS with all ones, the signal still gets whitened.
[17:38:27] <drmpeg> If your advisor demands a PBRS, I can make one for you.

[18:14:02] <mhilts[m]> If I have a file source outputting data in the "Byte" format directly into the "BBHeader" block (which takes 188 byte MPEG-2 Transport Stream Packets to produce FEC baseband frames), will the flow rate of the flowgraph be decimated by 188 after the BBheader block?
[18:16:09] <drmpeg> The BBheader block outputs 1 bit per byte.
[18:17:34] <drmpeg> The TS rate is determined by the symbol rate, code rate and modulation.
[18:18:28] <drmpeg> The TS rate calculator is here. https://github.com/drmpeg/dtv-utils/blob/master/dvbs2rate.c

[18:34:23] <mhilts[m]> Thanks! If the BBHeader takes in a byte (0-256) and produces a bit(0 or 1), wouldn't that result in a loss of information?
[18:36:45] <drmpeg> It outputs 8 bits for each byte.
[18:40:49] <drmpeg> Plus 80 bits of baseband header.
[18:41:04] <drmpeg> per FEC frame.
[18:45:51] <mhilts[m]> Ah, okay its starting to come together for me. Does data get "backed up" at all, since the blocks are regulated by a throttle and and BBHeader must produce 8x the samples it is receiving? (+80 bit headers every frame)
[18:47:37] <drmpeg> It's a transmit flow, so the bits are "pulled" from the file.

[19:18:41] <mhilts[m]> I think so! I'll give it a try, thanks!
[19:19:42] <drmpeg> The LFSR is from this specification. https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-O.151-199210-I/en
[19:20:44] <drmpeg> It was used in the ATSC 3.0 test files, so I thought it would be good to use.
[19:22:05] <drmpeg> usage is: tsprbs <outfile> <number of packets>
[19:22:18] <drmpeg> so like:
[19:22:45] <drmpeg> ./tsprbs test.ts 10000
[19:23:57] <drmpeg> and that will create a 1,880,000 byte file.
[19:29:30] <drmpeg> On the BBheader question, it's just reformating the input bytes into 1 bit per byte on the output. https://github.com/gnuradio/gnuradio/blob/main/gr-dtv/lib/dvb/dvb_bbheader_bb_impl.cc#L495-L498
[19:30:11] <drmpeg> Because the LDPC and BCH blocks want to work with bits.
