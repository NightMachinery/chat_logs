[07:20:19] <codingquark> Hmm... Audio first and then visuals... I will try experimenting with this approach
[08:27:01] <sachac> The audio is what makes your presentation sound like it flows smoothly
[08:27:34] <sachac> you can speed up or slow down visual segments to make them fit the audio

[18:14:59] <seabass_> codingquark: also, recording both video and audio can melt your CPU
[18:15:14] <seabass_> recording just the audio and adding the slides later in a video editor melts your CPU slightly less :)
[18:15:30] <seabass_> maybe also melts your brain less too hehe ;)
[18:18:51] <grym> i don't think i've ever given a talk i had a real script for 
[19:19:35] <codingquark> My CPU cannot melt!
[19:19:56] <codingquark> Well, I got a good gfx, so I should be okay
[19:20:18] <codingquark> Brain has mostly melted already with drafting
[20:24:11] <sachac> it's hard to ad-lib if you want to fit a lot of things into 10 minutes :)
[20:25:04] <sachac> we're looking for people who can stream extended Q&A, so there might be opportunities to go into more detail live
[20:27:19] <sachac> I'm aiming for about 160 words per minute, so I think I can squeeze my first draft into about 5 minutes. Just posted it at https://github.com/sachac/emacsconf-2021-emacs-news-highlights
