[00:38:08] <pmercado> Hi, how to get hexadecimal of a char? I'm doing a trim() in an empty csv cell, but doesn't cut space because is not a space char (tab, new line and others neither) so want to know what is
[00:38:33] <AllenJB> pmercado: bin2hex()
[00:39:50] <pmercado> ;Â ;Â ;Â ;Â ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;; <-- got this in okteta
[00:40:33] <pmercado> I'm importing a csv file, those Â should be empty
[00:40:49] <TinoDidriksen> bin2hex() dump it and see what's actually there.
[00:42:01] <pmercado> It's ok to be chars there, but looking to trim them, only preg_replace?
[00:43:19] <TinoDidriksen> You can trim Unicode spaces with preg_replace() with patterns /^[\s\pZ]+/u and /[\s\pZ]+$/u
[00:43:48] *** Joins: dlundgren_ (~dlundgren@utm1.ctic-inc.com)
[00:43:48] <biberu> pmercado: did you find php.net/fgetcsv btw?
[00:44:27] <pmercado> Seems we are using Spl file methods
[00:44:39] <__adrian> Spl is fine (preferable imo)
[00:44:57] <pmercado> TinoDidriksen: thanks, will looking in depth
[00:45:02] <__adrian> but they're the same function in the end
[00:45:31] <biberu> as long as you're parsing it with something that understands the format :)
[00:45:32] <pmercado> to test I need to remount database before upload file, take some time
[00:46:08] <TinoDidriksen> ...you don't have the CSV file available to look at?

[02:43:49] <BadAdviceCat> pmercado, what about characters that changes direction of text?
[02:45:38] <pmercado> surely I will die with all variants
[02:45:53] <__adrian> ...?
[02:45:57] <pmercado> https://www.php.net/manual/en/regexp.reference.unicode.php <--- Zs Space separator means "all kind of spaces"?
[02:46:40] <__adrian> ...yes
[02:46:50] <__adrian> which does not mean "whitespace" nor "nonprintable character"
[02:47:50] <__adrian> what are you actually looking for? and are you sure you're not just reading the file with the wrong charset?
[02:47:58] <pmercado> aah looking for clean a "string with spaces" but if I use Zs it clean white space and as a result i get a "stringwithspaces"
[02:48:12] <__adrian> no
[02:48:27] <__adrian> it's the "replace" part of preg_replace that's doing the replacing part
[02:48:44] <pmercado> yes, you are right
[02:49:10] <__adrian> the things you're saying seem to contradict each other
[02:49:25] <__adrian> if by "clean" you mean "remove" ...?
[02:49:33] <__adrian> yet then you complain that they're gone
[02:50:09] <__adrian> regarding the actual example you gave (nbsp) why would you want to remove it anyway?
[02:54:18] <pmercado> yes, sorry __adrian you are right, sorry by my bad english. I need to remove it because CSV files come with them in empty cells and I need to check if a cell is empty, currently it have a "non-breake-space" and trim don't cut that char
[02:56:02] <__adrian> a cell is not empty if it has _any_ character in it
[02:56:10] <__adrian> i.e., " " is not empty.  "" is.
[02:56:20] <__adrian> so you need to figure out which characters you want to count.
[02:56:40] <__adrian> count *as "empty"
[02:57:06] <__adrian> note "nonprinting" is not what you seem to want after all, as " " is certainly printable
[03:00:38] <pmercado> yeah an "empty" cell was a comparison only, that's why fail. Users think they are "empty" cell even with a white letter in a white background color
[03:07:59] <pmercado> now, if I got an real empty string, how is the correct way to check if it empty?  can I use empty() right?
[03:08:39] <__adrian> if you want an actual empty string, then  $value === ""

[18:06:13] <Poboy> biberu not yet.  New project for me and just 1 other dev currently.  One of my tasks is to create documentation for us to follow and I'd like us to format things the same way.
[18:09:38] <biberu> Poboy: sure, it's good to have some guidelines, but would still consider reviewing each others code even if it's just the two of you. it'll help spread knowledge, keep things consistent, catch more serious errors than sloppy formatting etc

[19:41:43] <TinoDidriksen> Maybe ask https://codereview.stackexchange.com/
[19:43:16] <Naktibalda> I think that you can't ask to review full project there
[19:43:30] <azy> i would want it done privately
[19:43:35] <Northwoods> Hi ,  i need to get the substring from this string --> https://3v4l.org/Iovvi
[19:44:04] <Naktibalda> azy: you can hire a code reviewer at https://www.codementor.io
[19:44:17] <da_wunder> I would not expect anyone to do that free
[19:44:26] <Northwoods> Naktibalda, any such place where you can learn to improve the code ?
[19:44:37] <Northwoods> compared to current code
[19:44:53] <Naktibalda> Northwoods: could you show more examples of source string?
[19:45:10] <Northwoods> Naktibalda, this one  -> https://3v4l.org/Iovvi  ??
[19:45:33] <Northwoods> Its a string brought out by OCR funciton
[19:45:57] <Northwoods> need to string after item:
[19:46:47] <Naktibalda> there was no "i" in "item" in your example
[19:47:03] <Northwoods> oh ok

[20:11:56] <Byteflux> Northwoods: It would be easier to answer the question if there was some established pattern to these strings that you need to extract substrings from. Without any specific pattern, all I know is that the substring is a number prefixed by "IWM" is the 4th "word" in $str. I assume not all substrings will follow that same pattern.
[20:12:53] <biberu> azy, Poboy: just want to add that the kind of review i'm talking about above is a continuous process, e.g. before any pr is accepted into your mainline, not something you order as a service now and then
[20:12:56] <Northwoods> Byteflux, right , not all start with "IWM" , a pattern that is common is string after "item:"
[20:13:15] <Northwoods> so we just need string after "item:"
[20:13:42] <Byteflux> Northwoods: But what about your first example? It's "SOEPRX281462tem:" -- is this a typo or did the OCR mess up?
[20:13:55] <Northwoods> OCRmess up
[20:14:05] <Northwoods> we can ignore these
[20:14:21] <Northwoods> just need to pull out after "item:"
[20:14:27] <Northwoods> or maybe "tem:"
[20:15:11] <Northwoods> if OCR is incorrect , we don't care , but if ocr has "item:" then we need next string
[20:16:07] <TinoDidriksen> So you just want to capture /i?tem: (\S+)/iu
[20:17:13] <Northwoods> correct TinoDidriksen
[20:18:03] <Byteflux> this still has a problem https://3v4l.org/d1dBH
[20:19:19] <Northwoods> Byteflux, thanks, still quite accurate
[20:19:20] <Byteflux> probably should change that i? to I? or add the /i modifier
[20:19:38] <Northwoods> ok
[20:19:40] <Byteflux> maybe don't even need the i? at all, really.
[20:19:49] <Northwoods> right

[22:27:15] <Rockwood> why its string https://3v4l.org/9Agkg?
[22:27:20] <Rockwood> why its string https://3v4l.org/9Agkg ?
[22:27:30] <Rockwood> null should be null
[22:27:46] <Rockwood> instead of string
[22:27:56] <__adrian> you're looking at the _type_
[22:28:01] <Rockwood> yeah
[22:28:08] <__adrian> you're not looking at the value
[22:28:16] <__adrian> https://php.net/gettype
[22:28:23] <__adrian> returns a string (the type)
[22:28:43] <Rockwood> ok
[22:29:18] <Rockwood> suppose if its shows object then?
[22:30:10] <__adrian> if you do gettype($some_object)? yes
[22:30:15] <__adrian> see docs
[22:30:49] <Byteflux> gettype() is a function that asks "what is it?" ... if you ask it about `null` then gettype() says 'it is "NULL"'
[22:32:20] <Rockwood> yes capital words
[22:32:45] <Byteflux> well that's not really important, the point is that it returns a string indicating the type
