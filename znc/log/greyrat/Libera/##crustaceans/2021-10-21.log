[00:11:16] <prussian> I just use duckduckgo because I can webscrape it.
[00:11:24] <prussian> Google requires a stupid api key
[00:16:32] <dimadima> what do you scrape it for
[00:20:04] <prussian> For the hell of it.
[00:20:06] <prussian> Simply
[00:20:13] <prussian> Mostly mdn
[00:20:39] <prussian> But mdn allegedly improved its search now
[00:20:41] <prussian> Or so I heard.

[01:27:45] <dimadima> yarn
[01:27:56] <dimadima> cmon buttsbot you can do it
[01:29:40] <indigo> Are you expecting butts
[01:31:14] <dimadima> i think it snarks at javascript. i was waiting for a dep to install so i thought it was appropriate
[01:32:02] <dimadima> "and then, get this, i used YARN to install a library that god knows who wrote"
[01:32:19] <dimadima> ... nothing
[02:10:42] <imode> yarn
[02:10:51] <imode> once again.
[02:10:53] <imode> yarn
[02:11:05] <imode> yarn is the best.
[02:12:42] <dimadima> imode: i'm not making this up right?
[02:13:09] <dimadima> i'm still on yarn 1.22 but i realllly need to upgrade to v2 or 3
[02:13:57] <indigo> I thought npm caught up to yarn
[02:14:06] <indigo> I don't really know what's better about any of 'em
[02:14:21] <dimadima> yarn 2 did away with node_modules installs
[02:14:42] <dimadima> so apparently your new installs go from many minutes to seconds
[02:15:04] <dimadima> it's different so it takes a bit to migrate, apparently
[02:15:19] <dimadima> yarn v1 and npm are basically feature equivalent at this point though
[02:15:27] <dimadima> workspaces being the big thing npm lacked for a while
[02:15:42] <dimadima> (workspaces ~ like maven submodules or whatever)
[02:16:44] <dimadima> but worksapces still suck
[02:16:46] <kline> never js
[02:16:48] <kline> not even once
[02:17:40] <dimadima> i just wish js would have been called something else, like webscript or something
[02:17:47] <dimadima> groovy is the real javascript
[02:19:26] <dimadima> i know people hate it for all sorts of reasons, but i think the name really led to a lot of misgivings from the beginning
[02:19:47] <dimadima> a real failure of managing expections
[02:21:03] <dimadima> i still hope rome comes through some day
[02:21:48] <dimadima> though looks like it doesn't manage dependencies, so fuck it
[02:22:51] <dimadima> (https://rome.tools/#development-status)
[02:22:51] <buttsbot> Rome Toolchain
[02:23:10] <dimadima> (a JS unified toolchain written in rust)
[02:24:06] <dimadima> lolol no, even better: big text at the top of the readme:
[02:24:12] <dimadima> Rome is currently being rewritten in Rust. Read more about it in our latest blog post.
[02:24:29] <drakonis> wait but why isnt being rewritten in javascript?
[02:25:15] <dimadima> because javascript sucks
[02:25:28] <indigo> WASM will save us
[02:25:29] <dimadima> how can you write anything in javascript
[02:25:49] <imode> WASM ain't shiiiiiiiiit.
[02:34:32] <indigo> Lulz, M1 Max benchmarks came out... same single core speed as M1
[02:34:46] <indigo> p e r f o r m a n c e
[02:50:40] <cb_> yueah, it's the same core as an iphone
[02:50:43] <cb_> it's just more of them
[02:50:59] <cb_> except that core trades blows with top tier ~95w ryzens
[02:51:24] <cb_> it's like complaining your i7 has the same single-core perf as an i5
[02:51:29] <cb_> same thing just more cores
[03:21:55] <hoistbypetard> cb_: i missed the €1k part too... i'd have cried "scammed hard" for half that.
[03:22:24] <drakonis> the m1 max has high gpu perf apparently?
[03:23:54] <hoistbypetard> looks like it has a pile of GPU cores, anyway
[03:24:37] <companion_cube> imode: wasm is still the fastest part of any js/wasm mix :p
[03:26:17] <cb_> hoistbypetard: if this was 5 years ago, it's still slightly sus bc thinkpad resale values fucking crater
[03:26:27] <cb_> BUT FORGIVCEABLE
[03:26:30] <cb_> goddamn it caps lock
[03:27:17] <hoistbypetard> i'm also just silently chuckling about saying "Lenovo, we need to talk" (about this machine you made 7 years ago)
[03:27:34] <cb_> yeah
[03:27:39] <cb_> the entire artticle is a trainwreck
[03:27:45] <cb_> massively reduced the respect i had for the author
[03:27:57] <cb_> tthere's no central thesis
[03:28:11] <cb_> you can branch out of it if it comes back to it
[03:28:30] <cb_> i can talk shit about this because i've tried so hard to make my writing less diarrhea of the mouth
[03:28:58] <cb_> it's three articles that crashed into each other
[03:29:49] <hoistbypetard> that's about the size of it right there. and one of those three, well edited, might've made a good post here
[05:26:38] <dmc> TIL homosexual men can't really donate blood
[05:26:52] <dmc> Temporary Reasons
[05:27:01] <dmc> Condition: You are a man who has had sex with another man
[05:27:17] <dmc> Length of time before you can give blood: 3 months after last occurrence
[05:34:51] <dimadima> dmc: huh
[05:34:58] <dimadima> what
[05:35:05] <dimadima> where
[05:40:25] <defect> NY for instance, a lot of the US i suspect
[05:41:56] <defect> most europeans weren't allowed to donate blood up until like 6 months ago
[05:42:19] <dimadima> you mean european gay men?
[05:42:30] <defect> no, europeans in general
[05:42:37] <dimadima> why not
[05:42:47] <defect> if you lived in europe in the 90s you weren't allowed to donate due to BSE
[05:43:32] <dimadima> so if you're a european in the united states you can't donate blood here?
[05:43:39] <defect> you can now, at least in NY
[05:43:52] <dimadima> but if you're a gay man you need to say whether or not you've had sex in the last 3 months?
[05:43:59] <dimadima> i had no idea that was still in effect
[05:44:06] <dimadima> wow
[05:52:41] <dmc> https://www.nybloodcenter.org/donate-blood/become-donor/can-i-donate-blood/
[05:52:42] <buttsbot> Can I donate blood? |  New York Blood Center
[05:53:01] <defect> the tattoos one is fun
[05:53:13] <dmc> I keep forgetting to start donating
[05:58:09] <dimadima> i just don't understand where's the uproar
[05:58:20] <dimadima> where's the even fake twitter outrage
[05:58:23] <dimadima> what am i missing here
[05:59:11] <dimadima> how are "Is a man who ever has had sex with another man" | "Has ever used illegal drugs with a needle" | "Has ever taken money or drugs in exchange for sex" in the same category
[06:21:51] <defect> i think it comes down to those groups having a higher probability of HIV infection, and it takes a few weeks/months to detect infections
[06:34:35] <dimadima> i wonder what the numbers are
[06:39:21] <defect> CDC says 70% of new HIV cases in 2019 were in gay and bisexual men. no idea if/how that would translate into increased risk of infection from a transfusion though
[06:51:10] <dimadima> damn
[06:51:22] <dimadima> well maybe hold the outrage, then
[06:51:41] <dimadima> that probably translates into... something
[06:52:28] <defect> well, i don't have a super strong opinion but maybe they could reword it with a focus on sexual health and activity rather than sexuality
[06:53:20] <defect> like, a gay man in a long-term relationship using condoms and PReP is probably less likely than some straight dude having multiple sex partners and not using condoms
[06:53:32] <dimadima> you'd think those would be the relevant factors
[06:53:42] <indigo> Good evening folks
[06:53:56] <dimadima> good evening indigo
[06:54:02] <defect> but what do i know :) when i wasn't allowed to donate blood it was just a bit annoyingg
[06:54:18] <defect> "well, i'll keep my tasty 0-blood to myself then"
[06:54:55] <indigo> Had my first day back in the office today
[06:55:14] <defect> how was it?
[06:55:49] <indigo> It was all right; still prefer working remote haha
[06:55:53] <dimadima> defect: i guess stats are stats but presenting it like that, alongside illegal drug use and prostitution is just... off
[06:56:10] <defect> yeah, agreed
[06:56:20] <dimadima> indigo: is it a back to office thing? or you voluntary
[06:56:23] <defect> i started going to the office last week
[06:56:29] <dimadima> wow
[06:56:34] <dimadima> everyone is going back
[06:56:44] <indigo> dimadima: I went in voluntarily today; don't have to come back until Jan of next year
[06:56:55] <defect> we're still opt-in too
[06:58:23] <indigo> Just wanted to check it out since a few of my coworkers were talking about how much they enjoyed being in the office
[06:58:41] <dimadima> what's the scene
[06:59:14] <indigo> They really like the free food I guess :-) I like making my own a bit better, get to choose the entrees
[07:01:17] <dimadima> i mean, lots of ppl there?
[07:01:18] <dimadima> masks?
[07:01:38] <dimadima> i'm guessing masks for sure...
[07:01:41] <indigo> Yeah lots of people, all wearing masks
[07:01:49] <indigo> I was surprised tbh about how many people were back
[07:02:44] <defect> where is your office?
[07:02:59] <defect> ours is pretty deserted still. i'd guesstimate 5-10% max
[07:03:17] <indigo> defect: Venice Beach
[07:04:03] <dimadima> defect: are you in california too
[07:04:20] <defect> no, new yorkr
[07:04:33] <dimadima> i haven't been to venice since the whole encampments things started (no idea how real that is, either, only seeing that on the news)
[07:04:41] <dimadima> but i love LA
[07:05:16] <dimadima> would it get old going to an office in venice?
[07:05:17] <indigo> dimadima: Yes, there are a lot of encampments; some streets are straight Mad Max
[07:05:48] <dimadima> i figure it must be real, a good friend's cousin lives there and leads an outraged residents groups type thing
[07:06:41] <dimadima> anyway i visited before all that and it was... wonderful
[07:06:48] <indigo> I mean, those people just need help
[07:07:10] <dimadima> yeah
[07:07:49] <dimadima> but i bet it sucks
[07:08:07] <dimadima> new york didn't have encampments when i left, but it did start having more and more and more small groups everywhere
[07:08:14] <indigo> LA, like any big city, has a bunch of homeless folks... one of them took a #2 on my friend's property a month ago
[07:08:18] <dimadima> a buildup that was like 3-5 years in the making
[07:08:26] <dimadima> i couldn't really handle it psychologically too much
[07:08:39] <dimadima> jeez a #2
[07:08:48] <indigo> I think COVID accelerated the growing economic divide
[07:10:15] <dimadima> for sure
[07:10:48] <dimadima> interesting seeing all this play out
[07:10:59] <dimadima> you see that sam altman tweet i dropped earlier
[07:11:40] <dimadima> https://t.co/Ed7YHI5IwN
[07:11:41] <indigo> Wowww
[07:11:48] <dimadima> lol
[07:11:58] <dimadima> i mean, not really "lol" but you know
[07:12:08] <dimadima> "Wowww" is more accurate
[07:18:26] <dimadima> bed time. au revoir
[07:24:39] <indigo> Спокойной ночи
[07:28:20] <dimadima> haha i don't know french i meant to say "bon soir"
[07:28:24] <dimadima> Спокойной ночи!
[07:29:36] <indigo> Au revoir works too!

[17:09:57] <gerikson> makes sense
[17:10:01] <gerikson> freedom 0
[17:10:07] <hoistbypetard_> he named it TRUTH
[17:10:08] <gerikson> or wait...
[17:10:10] <hoistbypetard_> PRAVDA
[17:10:26] *** hoistbypetard_ is now known as hoistbypetard
[17:11:25] <hoistbypetard> (I have no idea whether he named it or not, TBH. I still find it a very amusing choice of name.)
[17:12:33] <gwozniak> The masto instance I'm on is already blocking it
[17:13:38] <dimadima> nice gwozniak
[17:14:17] <companion_cube> why did y'all make me search about the trump social
[17:14:20] <companion_cube> why
[17:14:27] <companion_cube> > “We live in a world where the Taliban has a huge presence on Twitter, yet your favorite American President has been silenced. This is unacceptable," Trump said in a written statement included in the release.
[17:14:30] <gerikson> I think "Pravda" is just a generic newspaper name now.. very few people remember the 1984ish trnaslation
[17:14:34] <companion_cube> I mean, the hubris keeps impressing me
[17:14:39] <gerikson> besides I believe it predated the revolution
[17:15:07] <dimadima> is pravada in 1984?
[17:15:21] <dimadima> i must have forgotten that
[17:16:04] <gerikson> dimadima: no, but the idea of the newspaper of record in the Soviet Union called "Truth" must have inspired Orwell...
[17:16:26] <dimadima> sure
[17:16:33] <companion_cube> minilove
[17:16:36] <hoistbypetard> i had no idea it predated the revolution. i still find it interesting that a bunch of people who went to school in the 60s, 70s and 80s in the US and definitely knew that the soviet mouthpiece was called truth chose that name.
[17:17:06] <gerikson> hoistbypetard: doesn't mean they *learned* anything in school
[17:17:08] <phytyca> i would make a joke about how mastodon doesn't scale because its rails - but we also have a most likely negligent IT team behind this so its more likely not gonna make it to the rails bottlenecks
[17:17:12] <dimadima> hoistbypetard: i don't think they're particularly deep thinkers
[17:17:12] <gerikson> companion_cube: not Miniluv ?
[17:17:25] <companion_cube> Minilibuv
[17:17:30] <companion_cube> the ministry of node.js
[17:17:36] <hoistbypetard> fair enough
[17:17:54] <ngoldbaum> we have always been at war with rust
[17:17:56] <gerikson> ``The newspaper was an organ of the Central Committee of the CPSU between 1912 and 1991.''
[17:18:05] <gerikson> (Pravda)
[17:18:23] <dimadima> i'm more of an Iskra kind of guy myself
[17:18:39] <gerikson> `The Pravda paper is today run by the Communist Party of the Russian Federation, whereas the online Pravda.ru is privately owned and has international editions published in Russian, English, French and Portuguese.''
[17:18:43] <gerikson> TIL
[17:18:44] <dimadima> spark the fire under the feet of the bourgois pigs!
[17:18:49] <ngoldbaum> comintern for me
[17:19:00] <gerikson> Norrskensflamman
[17:19:02] <dimadima> yeah it's not even communist anymore
[17:19:07] <dimadima> to my knowledge
[17:19:11] <ngoldbaum> https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_International_(magazine)
[17:19:12] <buttsbot> Communist International (magazine) - Wikipedia
[17:19:31] <hoistbypetard> we could argue about how long the soviets were communist
[17:19:48] <dimadima> they were never communists, i don't thinkthere's an argument there?
[17:19:56] <dimadima> by their own admission, they never made it
[17:20:21] <gerikson> Pravda had great branding tho
[17:20:23] <hoistbypetard> heh. i didn't know they admitted it
[17:20:39] <ngoldbaum> no true scotsma^H^H^Hcommunist
[17:20:56] <dimadima> hoistbypetard: yeah they set up socialism in the 20s, and were always working "toward communism", like "we'll have communism in 20 years" etc, but it never materializedd
[17:20:59] <dimadima> (pun intended)
[17:21:52] <dimadima> a fun (or perhaps not so fun) discussion would be whether they had socialism
[17:23:28] <dimadima> During the period of Brezhnev's leadership, the term "Era of Stagnation" was not used. Instead Brezhnev used the term "period of developed socialism" (Russian: период развитого социализма) for the period that started in 1971. This term stemmed from Khrushchev's promise in 1961 of reaching communism in 20 years.[3]

[17:24:09] <ngoldbaum> every time i read something dan luu wrote it leaves a sour taste in my mouth, everyone seems to think he’s a thought leader but he just comes across as an arrogant ass to me
[17:24:57] <hoistbypetard> i don't always feel that way, but i did after the one about "looking stupid"
[17:25:33] <gerikson> I am neutral towards him
[17:25:39] <gwozniak> same
[17:26:07] <gwozniak> I didn't see the "looking stupid" one

[17:26:32] <ngoldbaum> oh must have been removed by dang
[17:26:41] <ngoldbaum> oh no #2 i can read
[17:27:36] <dimadima> i don't get why he makes the homepage all the time
[17:27:41] <gerikson> I had a classmate who posed "stupid questions" but was top of the class
[17:28:25] <hoistbypetard> some people have a knack for asking "stupid questions" in a very relatable way that makes you glad you explored them
[17:29:08] <gerikson> wow extended humblebrag
[17:29:25] <dimadima> gerikson: i wanted to say that
[17:29:37] <deadk> i didn't notice that last post
[17:29:38] <dimadima> but i had just yesterday called something a humblebrag
[17:29:39] <ngoldbaum> i asked questions a lot in school and suffered socially for it
[17:29:42] <gwozniak> The first sentence is really sus
[17:29:58] <dimadima> it's just a long-form stroking
[17:30:02] <dimadima> self-stroke

[17:30:19] <deadk> also i feel like anoyne vaguely smart has probably experienced being thought stupid by people who couldn't understand why you'd ask a certain question
[17:30:23] <deadk> or anyone
[17:30:35] <dimadima> yes
[17:30:52] <deadk> it doesn't really need an article
[17:31:08] <deadk> but i'm sure people will upvote it because they'll read it and think wow! that happens to me too! guess i must be really smart like dan luu
[17:31:50] <ngoldbaum> he works at twitter and constantly says how valuable he is to them because he’s Very Smart and You Aren’t
[17:31:55] <dimadima> he's so brave
[17:32:36] <deadk> hmm, so he's very smart and also has no morals?
[17:32:44] <deadk> i'm starting to see why HN likes him
[17:33:07] <dimadima> the real problem with it is that's it's lame and stupid
[17:33:08] <ngoldbaum> this is also influenced by him being an asshole to me on the RC zulip, basically subtweeting me because he didn’t like some advice i gave to someone (contributing to open source as a way to burnish a resume) and took my giving that advice as a sign that the RC community as a whole is going downhill
[17:33:14] <dimadima> the post i mean
[17:33:16] <gerikson> also has no web styling which is major points on HN
[17:33:22] <ngoldbaum> and then like he’s constantly subtweeting people on his twitter
[17:33:27] <dimadima> the examples suck
[17:33:39] <dimadima> yes i love having to resize my browser to read his stupid post
[17:33:40] <ngoldbaum> like he blocks their names but his twitter is popular enough i’m sure the authors he’s criticizing sees them
[17:33:59] <dimadima> lol sorry i'll stop
[17:34:11] <ngoldbaum> thanks for confirming i’m not the only one who gets frustrated by this shit
[17:34:13] <deadk> dimadima: "the real problem with it is that's it's lame and stupid" reminds me of a nile red video
[17:34:37] * dimadima googles nile red
[17:34:52] <deadk> i can't remember what he's doing, but he does something differently, and then says "but that still didn't change the major problem which was that this method sucked"
[17:35:05] <dimadima> oh cool a chemistry yt
[17:35:29] <dimadima> haha deadk yeah i model my critical processes on beavis and butt-head
[17:35:48] <dimadima> it helps getting to the heart of things as fast as possible
[17:36:00] <gwozniak> I'm a few paragraphs into this post and I can't get over how much it's droning on about mundane stuff
[17:36:24] <gwozniak> I clearly haven't read much of his "social" stuff
[17:36:56] <dimadima> basically what he's saying is that on the Kohlberg morality levels, he's jesus
[17:36:58] <pja> How did you find Recurse ngoldbaum ?
[17:37:05] <dimadima> that's the heart of the post, really
[17:37:35] <ngoldbaum> pja: i like it a lot my complaints about dan notwithstanding, there’s jerks in every community
[17:37:52] <gwozniak> disappointed to see Laurence Tratt as someone who provided editorial guidance

[17:37:59] <ngoldbaum> remote RC is here to stay if you want to do a batch from home
[17:38:08] <pja> Have the claims about “recurse alumni” panned out for you?
[17:38:20] <hoistbypetard> ngoldbaum: really?
[17:38:24] <ngoldbaum> i’m not aware of that
[17:38:27] <hoistbypetard> i was afraid i'd missed my window
[17:38:45] <pja> IIRC both you & angry|friendlysock have been at Recurse from lobsters.
[17:38:48] <ngoldbaum> hoistbypetard: it makes it *way* easier to get non-US people to come and participate
[17:39:00] <hoistbypetard> i think i'm in a decent-ish place for it next year, but figured it'd be back in-person by then
[17:39:14] <ngoldbaum> yeah i was there in-batch with him
[17:39:18] <ngoldbaum> and shapr
[17:39:18] <pja> Yes, there’s not much likelihood of me flying to NY for three months, even outside a pandemic times.
[17:39:45] <ngoldbaum> hoistbypetard: they’re also trying to sell the remote RC software so they’re gonna continue working on it
[17:39:48] <deadk> i wonder if there's any sort of social platform type thing for planning events like this so as to avoid meeting anyone you know
[17:39:52] <ngoldbaum> it’s sorta like gather.town
[17:40:26] <ngoldbaum> pja: what claims?
[17:40:41] <pja> It’s a little surprising that no one else has set up anything similar in Europe, but I guess the seed funding you’d need is significant.
[17:41:04] <pja> ngoldbaum: They’re just very keen on their whole “you never stop being a Recurse person” on the blog.
[17:41:23] <ngoldbaum> oh i mean for some people sure
[17:41:34] <gwozniak> okay, I've got too much other pressing stuff to do rather than read that tripe of a post
[17:42:06] <ngoldbaum> especially if you lived in NYC it was extremely convenient to have access to a free friendly coworking space
[17:42:31] <pja> I bet.
[17:43:12] <pja> I should try the co-working space in Oxford sometime actually. Maybe when this covid wave has died down a bit.
[17:44:32] <ngoldbaum> there’s also plenty of people that participate in batch then are never seen or heard from again
[17:44:58] <gwozniak> makes it sound like some kind of mafia thing ;)
[17:45:18] <ngoldbaum> it’s definitely cult-adjacent :p
[17:45:27] <ngoldbaum> has some cult characteristics
[17:45:36] <gwozniak> Maybe they are on a comet somewhere
[17:50:47] <pja> Yes, you could go from Recurse -> Leverage a bit too easily with the right (well, very wrong!) leadership I suspect.
[17:51:12] <pja> (Leverage was the Rationalist cult that broke up a year or two ago IIRC.)
[17:51:56] <ngoldbaum> thankfully nick, albert, and sonali (the founders) seem to have their head on their shoulders
[17:52:13] <ngoldbaum> there is VC money involved but they’re a minority share in the business afaik
[17:53:35] <hoistbypetard> ngoldbaum: what's the business model?
[17:53:51] <pja> Yes, YC funded them initially I believe, plus some from the Ubuntu guy (if I read that correctly). Seems they only really needed seed funding & income from recruitment consultants is sufficient to cover on-going costs.
[17:54:00] <pja> Just shows how much cash their is in recruitment...
[17:54:03] <pja> (there)
[17:54:05] <ngoldbaum> hoistbypetard: there’s a recruiting business you can use if you want
[17:55:08] <hoistbypetard> oh good... that seems perfectly reasonable. when i saw VC my mind went to darker places than that
[17:55:20] <pja> “Here, have a pre-screened candidate who is available right now because they’ve just finished a Recurse & you can even look at the code they’ve just produced” has to be fairly compelling.
[17:55:42] <hoistbypetard> yeah, really
[17:55:46] <indigo> “Code looks great, but can they leetcode?”
[17:56:14] <pja> Ah, the sign-up form suggest they charge 25%. I image that’s 25% of annual salary.
[17:56:34] <ngoldbaum> yeah it is
[17:56:45] <ngoldbaum> out of the company’s pocket
[17:56:56] <hoistbypetard> that seems high, but for a very low risk higher, not insanely high
[17:57:00] <hoistbypetard> hire
[17:57:23] <ngoldbaum> it’s a bit of a bait and switch for some people though
[17:57:31] <ngoldbaum> they don’t have a lot of entry level positions
[17:57:55] <ngoldbaum> so there’s definitely people that come to RC for a career change from, like, being a barista, and then never find a job
[17:59:02] <hoistbypetard> that might just be an outreach problem on the recruiting side. last time i hired entry level, i'd have loved a pool like that
[17:59:02] <pja> hoistbypetard: No, that’s entirely in line with what I’ve heard about recruitment fees elsewhere.
[17:59:32] <hoistbypetard> last time i paid them they were more like 15% of first year
[17:59:37] <hoistbypetard> but it's been a little bit
[17:59:56] <pja> ngoldbaum: To me, it doesn’t sound like Recurse is a good fit for someone who doesn’t already have some experience.
[18:00:12] <hoistbypetard> they were also typically structured as X up front and the rest after Y months
[18:00:28] <pja> hoistbypetard: Might reflect the fact that the labour market is super tight right now by all accounts? I’d expect fees to rise as a consequence.
[18:00:37] <hoistbypetard> sure
[18:00:38] <indigo> Wooof, the latest Dan Luu post reads #iamverysmart to me :(
[18:00:43] <ngoldbaum> i agree but they also want to build a community more diverse than the industry as a whole and i think not highlighting the difficulties entry level people have is part of that
[18:00:54] <ngoldbaum> that’s why i called it a bait and switch
[18:01:04] <ngoldbaum> indigo: me too
[18:01:40] <indigo> I feel like he kinda jumped the shark with his latest posts
[18:01:58] <ngoldbaum> IMO he’s always been an arrogant ass
[18:02:22] <indigo> Hahaha
[18:06:49] <hoistbypetard> on a different bent... anyone have an opinion on htmx vs the basecamp thing ( https://hotwired.dev/ )? something in that vein would be very helpful for me, and i have no legacy concerns that would suggest one over the other
[18:06:50] <buttsbot> HTML Over The Wire | Hotwire
[18:17:08] <dimadima> just used a CSS float the way it was intended to be used
[18:17:30] <dimadima> which, now that flex and grid are a thing, is pretty refreshing
[18:18:12] <dimadima> hoistbypetard: i'm not sure what you mean?
[18:18:27] <dimadima> basecamp is tha team project managment sofware, i thought
[18:18:43] <dimadima> OH they make hotwired
[18:19:38] <dimadima> have been curious about hotwire for a long time myself; first time hearing about htmx
[18:19:41] <ngoldbaum> why is the javascript wat talk #1 on lobste.rs right now?
[18:19:47] <ngoldbaum> watman indeed
[18:20:40] <hoistbypetard> the developers of basecamp (who also developed hey) are pushing hotwired as a way to make server-rendered things have more of what people like about SPAs. htmx is a pretty similar but seems to maybe have more uptake outside rails
[18:21:15] <hoistbypetard> it looks to me like hotwired might be a little easier to get progressive enhancement working
[18:21:58] <dimadima> how do you deploy them?
[18:22:30] <ngoldbaum> isn’t that basically reinventing CGI scripts?
[18:23:10] <hoistbypetard> not exactly. you serve it up with things that reinvented cgi scripts back in the mid 2000s
[18:23:49] <hoistbypetard> dimadima: you can pull them down through a cdn or ship the minimal js with your pages
[18:24:18] <hoistbypetard> for some of the websockets stuff (that's not what i'm after right now) you do need a little server support
[18:24:51] <dimadima> that's cool
[18:25:09] <companion_cube> is it me or is github slow AF today
[18:25:26] <hoistbypetard> github is slow AF today
[18:25:37] <hoistbypetard> it's absurd
[18:27:20] <pja> ngoldbaum: Some people just can’t stop themselves from upvoting things.
[18:28:49] <hoistbypetard> ngoldbaum: suppose you have a web form with a couple of drop-down choices. those choices influence what appears in a list of items you can select using check boxes. with traditional CGI, changing a drop down choice would make the whole page reload. and leaving the drop down choice on the page would mean you'd need to accommodate a way to change it again.
[18:29:49] <hoistbypetard> these things offer you a middle ground in terms of interactivity between re-rendering the whole page or having a javascript http client started on the first load grab some serialized objects and update the DOM
[18:30:52] <hoistbypetard> the main benefit of that being i can track my state on the server side only but get dynamism that feels almost like i wrote that javascript client, and can fail back to the traditional CGI mode for UAs that don't do rich javascript
[18:31:15] <ngoldbaum> indigo: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28942648 it us
[18:31:16] <buttsbot> One way to prove that he truly doesn't mind looking stupid would be to list time... | Hacker News
[18:32:13] <ngoldbaum> hoistbypetard: fair enough, doing all your html-munging server side is appealing if only to escape the horrorshow that is frontend webdev
[18:33:26] <pja> A fair comment.
[18:34:01] <pja> Like, he appears to be unaware that buying comprehensive (full coverage) car insurance can be /cheaper/ than 3rd party only for the same vehicle + drivers.
[18:34:24] <pja> But no, apparently he knows more about the insurance industry than veteren salepeople do.
[18:35:45] <pja> Obvs this varies a lot, but his insistence on doing things his way is something of a red flag.
[18:36:26] <ngoldbaum> yeah he has a very strong prior that everything he says is right which just reeks of overconfidence to me
[18:36:57] <ngoldbaum> just on a rhetorical level he’d be more convincing if he didn’t couch his posts that way
[18:38:06] <indigo> He also seems like he doesn’t want to spend the time to explain *why* to others
[18:38:27] <indigo> Like why did he want the laptop with the smallest box?
[18:38:46] <deadk> it can be very difficult to explain why you're on a certain train of thought
[18:39:04] <indigo> Maybe he could be self-aware enough to convert that to a model
[18:39:38] <deadk> maybe he didn't know what the smallest one was. who knows?
[18:39:53] <deadk> but i definitely think the shop person was acting reasonably
[18:40:38] <pja> Why the hell would you want the smallest box anyway? Does it imply that it’s the strongest one?
[18:40:51] *** Joins: reneeontheweb (~reneeonth@c188-149-36-100.bredband.tele2.se)
[18:40:52] <pja> Just the smallest one overall? It makes no sense.
[18:41:31] <deadk> possibly he wanted to take it in his hand luggage on a plane
[18:42:34] <deadk> but i mean, accepting that he had a good reason, asking a question that you'd normally only ask if you were very confused is going to make people think you're very confused
[18:42:41] <dimadima> it was obviously an environmental concern and he's bashful about coming off as too much of a tree hugger
[18:42:48] <indigo> Who knows? But hey, he is very smart and the audience should trust that he had a good reason
[18:43:24] <hoistbypetard> he's so unconcerned about appearing stupid that he can't even be bothered to explain his very good reason
[18:43:33] <ngoldbaum> also the apple store employee has a strong prior that strange questions come from a place of confusion
[18:43:40] <deadk> yeah
[18:43:47] <ngoldbaum> otherwise they wouldn’t be in the store asking strange questions
[18:43:57] <indigo> A lot of social interaction is about knowing your audience
[18:44:05] <gwozniak> indeed
[18:44:36] <deadk> i don't really blame dan for not explaining the very good reason, the problem with that example is much more that he's not seeing it from the shop assistant's point of view
[18:45:18] <ngoldbaum> i think having empathy conflicts with the conviction that there’s always one right answer or explanation
[18:45:51] <indigo> Ooh that’s an interesting thought
[18:46:24] <dimadima> yeah i mean it would take all of 3 breaths to explain why he wants the small box
[18:46:30] <dimadima> instead he's just being a jerk-off weirdo
[18:46:32] <dimadima> and then blogging about it
[18:46:55] <hoistbypetard> curiously, this made me go back to one of his writings that i didn't dislike as intensely.  https://danluu.com/productivity-velocity/ would have been a better piece, IMO, if he'd spent more time on what he did to work on his productivity/velocity apart from typing speed (which he clearly doesn't assign much of it to)
[18:46:55] <buttsbot> Some reasons to work on productivity and velocity
[18:46:55] <dimadima> (explain to the salesperson)
[18:47:23] <hoistbypetard> i thought there was a lot of reasonable stuff in that one, but i felt like something was missing, and that's it.
[18:48:51] <indigo> I felt like that one was a fluff piece that didn’t really say anything
[18:49:20] <ngoldbaum> sorry to make the channel dan luu complaint hour this morning it’s just been sticking in my craw lately

[18:53:26] <gwozniak> I wish I could spend more free time using my telescope
[18:53:40] <indigo> Hell yeah!! Telescopes are cool
[18:53:44] <hoistbypetard> me too but... getting faster at trying things out is worth something to me personally
[18:53:53] <dimadima> nice gwozniak what kind do you have
[18:54:21] <gwozniak> I do look into being more "productive", but I don't devote my non-work time to it
[18:54:53] <gwozniak> dimadima: I have a 110mm apochromatic refractor
[18:55:48] <hoistbypetard> gwozniak: i don't need to be more productive for work time. the only reason i care is being able to do more with "free" time :)
[18:56:36] <indigo> It’s your free time! Don’t let anyone tell you what to do with it ;)
[18:58:23] <indigo> Wow, that worldcoin article on HN

[19:02:09] <phytyca> well that can only go one of two ways
[19:02:11] <indigo> Still feels weird though
[19:02:24] <ngoldbaum> yeah hope it’s not bad news

[19:02:59] <gwozniak> time to take up baking and switch careers
[19:03:20] <indigo> Might as well find a remote team within Google and finish my vesting
[19:03:35] <indigo> Then join RC and be as cool as Dan Luu
[19:03:58] <imode> just do software consulting.
[19:04:04] <imode> easier than you'd think these days.
[19:04:11] <ngoldbaum> you can be a more chill thought leader
[19:04:30] <imode> where's the money in that. :P
[19:04:31] <indigo> Actually I prefer the term “thot leader”, as in That Ho Over There
[19:04:57] <ngoldbaum> indigo: do you think volvo is the only ethically justified car manufacturer?
[19:05:03] <ngoldbaum> if not you’re already chiller
[19:05:20] <imode> fuck cart manufacturers in general.
[19:05:25] <imode> car. it's early.
[19:05:27] <indigo> I don’t know enough about car manufacturing ethics to even answer that question
[19:06:24] <ngoldbaum> ahcktooally it’s about ethics on automotive manufacturing

[21:55:53] <ngoldbaum> everyone with broken pgup keys thanks you dimadima
[21:57:05] <Brekkjern> From my eyes this code should work, but it doesn't act the way I expect it to
[21:57:38] <dmc> has DDG been slow for anyone else
[21:58:24] <Brekkjern> Specifically the push command doesn't work
[21:58:48] <Brekkjern> Instead of making the stack into a list that contains (4 3 2 1) it becomes (1)
[21:59:51] <riv> what is initial?
[22:00:16] <Brekkjern> Initial is what is set during the make-stack call
[22:00:40] <Brekkjern> It should be a list of some sort
[22:00:48] <riv> ok but this code should error
[22:00:56] <Brekkjern> Well, it aint :P
[22:00:58] <riv> imagine I load up this code and call (stack)
[22:01:11] <riv> initial is an undefined variabl
[22:01:24] <Brekkjern> No?
[22:01:32] <riv> yes
[22:01:38] <indigo> I wonder if args is not being recognized as a list
[22:01:42] <pja> Brekkjern: My scheme is rusty, but aren’t you expecting the argument to push-iter to always be a list?
[22:01:51] <Brekkjern> pja: Yes
[22:01:55] <pja> But sometimes you’re pushing an atom?
[22:02:02] <Brekkjern> Dunno tbh
[22:02:08] <pja> (Maybe I’m wrong about that...)
[22:02:12] <Brekkjern> That might be the reason, but I don't know :S
[22:02:42] <Brekkjern> The problem is that this isn't working at all like I expect it to, so I don't even know what is happening :S
[22:03:02] <indigo> I actually don't get (4 3 2 1) when I push 1 2 3 4 to the stack
[22:03:04] <indigo> I get 1 instead
[22:03:06] <pja> No, I think it is always a list.
[22:03:09] <riv> oh I misread the code, I thought these definitions were at the top level, but they are inside the definition of make-stack
[22:03:15] <Brekkjern> indigo: Yes. That is the problem.
[22:03:34] <indigo> Right, derp... it is in your output :)
[22:03:38] <Brekkjern> Yeah :)
[22:05:15] <Brekkjern> output.txt is the actual output. The comments next to the the lines below is what is expected.
[22:05:20] <riv> push-iter doesn't make sense
[22:06:22] <Brekkjern> I agree. I just don't have any idea why :P
[22:06:43] <riv> so you use push variadically
[22:06:56] <riv> that means you need to define it like   (define (push! . vals)
[22:07:11] <Brekkjern> Let me try that quick
[22:07:15] <riv> oh wait, you call it via dispatch
[22:07:23] <riv> so that is already handled, my bad
[22:07:26] <Brekkjern> Yeah
[22:07:42] <Brekkjern> Because with your definition the stack becomes this: ((1 2 3 4))
[22:07:50] <Brekkjern> Which is not what I want at all :P
[22:08:03] <riv> in push-iter you shoudl have a null? case and a cons case, for the input
[22:08:12] <riv> (if (null? list) #t  ;; do nothing
[22:08:31] <riv> otherwise push (car list) then (push-iter (cdr list))
[22:08:38] <indigo> But it already does that, no?
[22:08:49] <riv> oh
[22:08:58] <riv> so you have got (if thing x y)
[22:09:06] <riv> that's like if(thing) { x } else { y }
[22:09:25] <riv> if you want to do both x and y, it would be (when thing (begin x y))
[22:09:33] <gerikson> wtf is Worldcoin
[22:09:52] <indigo> Ahhh basically the recursion is in the else-expr?
[22:09:53] <defect> not sure i want to know
[22:10:07] <ngoldbaum> gerikson: a blockchain where your wallet key is an eyeball biometric scan
[22:10:08] <indigo> So it only pushes the first element and then returns
[22:10:13] <Brekkjern> WAIT
[22:10:15] <Brekkjern> I SEE IT
[22:10:16] <Brekkjern> FUCK
[22:10:18] <indigo> LOL
[22:10:34] <ngoldbaum> Brekkjern sees worldcoin!
[22:10:56] <Brekkjern> God damn it...
[22:10:59] <pja> Brekkjern: your pop! method doesn’t have an else clause; it should probably return null on empty?
[22:11:03] <pja> or () or something.
[22:11:12] <Brekkjern> pja: Correct
[22:11:24] <Brekkjern> Or actually, no
[22:11:38] <Brekkjern> It shouldn't return anything at all when empty
[22:12:08] <pja> And your push-iter iterates down the list and only pushes the last item.
[22:12:25] <pja> Can a scheme function return nothing at all? Is that allowed?
[22:12:32] <pja> (My scheme is /extremely/ rusty.)
[22:12:46] <pja> I guess it’s not a functional language, so yes...
[22:12:47] <indigo> `cond` might be nicer to express conditionals in Scheme
[22:12:49] <Brekkjern> No, this is even dumber
[22:13:11] <Brekkjern> It evals to if not null? then set, else push-iter
[22:13:14] <pja> Or else push-iter only pushes the first item. One or the other.
[22:13:28] <pja> It doesn’t look right anyway.
[22:13:37] <Brekkjern> I put it into a begin block and it works
[22:13:44] <Brekkjern>   (define (push-iter list)
[22:13:44] <Brekkjern>     (if (not (null? list))
[22:13:44] <Brekkjern>         (begin
[22:13:44] <Brekkjern>           (set! initial (cons (car list) initial))
[22:13:44] <Brekkjern>           (push-iter (cdr list)))))
[22:13:49] <Brekkjern> That works
[22:13:59] <indigo> Perfect
[22:14:04] <riv> recommend WHEN and UNLESS rather than one-armed-if
[22:14:28] <pja> I think what you had written made the second line of the begin block the else clause of the if.
[22:14:31] <Brekkjern> riv: Never heard of those keywords, but I'll look them up
[22:14:37] <pja> (what you had originally written)
[22:14:38] <indigo> TIL `when`
[22:14:41] <riv> also (push! val) vs (push-iter list) is very confusing, recommend that they both be called list
[22:14:42] <Brekkjern> pja: Exactly
[22:14:52] <imode> wheeeeeeeeeeeeeen.
[22:15:18] <indigo> I always thought Scheme didn't have `if`... only `cond`
[22:15:18] <riv> having not done scheme in a while, wow I suck
[22:15:37] <Brekkjern> when doesn't seem to be part of the version we are using
[22:15:40] <Brekkjern> R5RS
[22:16:12] * pja ~~~ I remember when R5RS was the new hotness ~~~
[22:16:18] <gwozniak> Having an editor that knows how to indent Scheme helps, too.  Then it would indent the (push-iter (cdr list)) differently
[22:16:41] <indigo> Eight hours for work, eight hours for rest, eight hours for emacs
[22:17:24] <riv> that's weird, R5RS does have WHEN
[22:17:59] <riv> you can define it if you like, (define-syntax when (syntax-rules () ((when <cond> <body> ...) (if <cond> (begin <body> ...) #f))))
[22:18:09] <indigo> Yeah, I think it's BWSD rather than R5RS
[22:18:14] <indigo> Brekkjern's Weird Scheme Dialect
[22:18:36] <Brekkjern> I don't have the faintest fucking clue what is in the dialect or not, but when I try to use it it is just undefined
[22:18:59] <riv> what program are you using to run your scripts?
[22:19:02] <Brekkjern> DrRacket
[22:19:07] <imode> oh.
[22:19:14] <imode> you sure you usin' scheme.
[22:19:15] <Brekkjern> Because they told us we should use that or emacs
[22:19:23] <riv> drracket has multiple modes/languages
[22:19:32] <riv> you usually put a #lang directive at the top of your files
[22:19:39] <Brekkjern> It says R5RS in the bottom of the window where we choose the language
[22:19:46] <Brekkjern> And that is what we were told to use :S
[22:22:06] <riv> that's crazy, I could have sworn WHEN and UNLESS was in the standard
[22:22:08] <riv> but it's not
[22:22:53] <gwozniak> Not surprising
[22:23:48] <pja> Oh, DrRacket runs a constrained version of scheme doesn’t it?
[22:24:08] <pja> Like, it’s in training wheels mode unless you tell it otherwise & doesn’t define the whole universe of scheme functions IIRC.
[22:25:56] <pja> (checks)
[22:26:22] <pja> Yeah, Racket doesn’t implement all of R5RS. It’s not a full scheme in that sense.
[22:26:34] <pja> But it’s very, very ... scheme-like.
[22:27:04] <riv> i think it does have a faithful R5RS mode, but normally you run it in #lang racket mode, which is its own language with way more stuff
[22:27:20] <riv> I just had a false memory that WHEN was part of R5RS, but it's actually not
[22:28:08] <Brekkjern> The way we were told to use it was to choose languages, go to "Other Languages", select "R5RS" under "Legacy Languages" and that has a tooltip of "RFRS, with no frills"
[22:28:13] <Brekkjern> So I bet it's really stripped down

[22:32:30] <pja> Don’t have much to compare it with mind.
[22:32:49] <pja> Also, there’s a ton of DNN stuff that’s been done in the last 10 years which obviously doesn’t get touched.
[22:33:42] <pja> Oh, and I have developed a special hate for the style of mathematical notation that apparently ML papers must use. Too many indicies!

[22:39:05] <pja> ngoldbaum: You can avoid all the stress though.
[22:39:28] <pja> There’s always a stress-free route.
[22:39:55] <ngoldbaum> i don’t really want to wander around in the dark to find them :/
[22:40:08] <pja> But I think they could have signposted “hey, you don’t /have/ to do this the hard way” a little more effectively.

[22:54:39] <imode> no, you need yuzu for that. didn't you want to emulate galaxy, though.
[22:54:45] <imode> that was for the wii.
[22:54:53] <imode> indigo: yeah..
[22:57:28] <riv> i think I tried yuzu
[22:57:36] <riv> i meant oddysee., that was just my test to see if it could emulate fast enough
