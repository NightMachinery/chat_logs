Acorrding to this post: https://github.com/gnuradio/gnuradio/issues/2941
[15:15:12] <jemius> After I have called get_tags_in_range(), the tag buffer is empty, right?
[15:15:31] <Yamakaja[m]> I don't think tags are "consumed"
[15:16:15] <jemius> They have to be thrown away anywhere. Otherwise, the buffer would grow to infinity over time
[15:16:19] <jemius> *somewhere
[15:16:22] <jemius> *sometime
[15:17:14] <Yamakaja[m]> Well, i'd assume only the tags for which work has been called are guaranteed to be available. Not sure though
[15:18:04] <Yamakaja[m]> (Tags are associated with a particular sample, so once that sample has passed the flowgraph, why keep the tag around)?
[15:21:24] <jemius> I trigger an event based on the first tag which occurs in all samples reaching general_work. This code apparently always gives the same result, although the Tag changes in the python-block generating it https://pastebin.com/67ptzvEq
[15:26:00] <Notou[m]> Using get_tags_in_range, you target tags based on an absolute indexing of samples, from the start of the flowgraph (init of the buffer really), so if you ask always for tags in the first few samples, you always will see the same ones. Either use get_tags_in_window, or change the indeces to account for how many samples you've seen before (using nitems_read())
[15:27:15] <jemius> Notou[m], ah, i see
[15:29:22] <jemius> Geil, it works. We are so talented, working together, Notou[m]

[17:19:11] <cpfig[m]> I am using Ubuntu, data is set as short to the UDP sink
[17:19:39] <cpfig[m]> Anyone has a clue on what I can do to solve this?
[17:19:52] <cpfig[m]> I friend of mine says it works on Windows
[17:28:44] <willcode4[m]> Just tried it and this works. Make sure the flowgraph is producing `short` samples and that their amplitude is scaled correctly (+/-32767 full scale). You will still need a throttle in the flowgraph since there is not backpressure on a UDP sink. This gives you a "two clock" problem, so there could be artifacts in the audio periodically. It looks like you can ignore that error - I see it on the console.
[17:31:57] <cpfig[m]> thanks. Did you use an endian swap block?
[17:32:48] <willcode4[m]> No. Signal Source (short, amplitude 5000), Throttle, UDP Sink.
[17:33:39] <cpfig[m]> I was using a RTLSDR source, so should I need the Throttle?
[17:34:17] <willcode4[m]> No Throttle, then.
[17:35:40] <willcode4[m]> Debug it in pieces. Make sure audio works, then check that the flowgraph before the UDP Sink is creating samples of the right type, amplitude, rate (using one of the graphical sinks).
[17:35:56] <cpfig[m]> The audio works if I use a audio sink
[17:36:10] <cpfig[m]> I will have to check the amplitude
[17:36:54] <willcode4[m]> The audio sink scales for you.
