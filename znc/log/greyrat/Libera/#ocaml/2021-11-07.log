[11:14:45] <d_bot> <a-c-sreedhar-reddy> Hi all.
[11:14:45] <d_bot> <a-c-sreedhar-reddy> Opening a project in vscode, `ocamllsp` throws the following error.
[11:14:46] <d_bot> <a-c-sreedhar-reddy> ```
[11:14:47] <d_bot> <a-c-sreedhar-reddy> /Users/acsreedharreddy/.opam/4.06.1/lib/ocaml/compiler-libs/location.cmi
[11:14:49] <d_bot> <a-c-sreedhar-reddy> seems to be compiled with OCaml 4.06.
[11:14:50] <d_bot> <a-c-sreedhar-reddy> But this instance of Merlin handles OCaml 4.12.```
[11:14:51] <d_bot> <a-c-sreedhar-reddy>
[11:14:53] <d_bot> <a-c-sreedhar-reddy> How can I fix this?
[11:14:54] <d_bot> <a-c-sreedhar-reddy> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/436568060288172044/906811395268571156/error.png
[11:21:36] <d_bot> <Ulugbek> I feel like you want to compile your project with your OCaml version 4.12; it seems now to be compiled with 4.06
[11:23:04] <d_bot> <a-c-sreedhar-reddy> I ran `make` command which compiles using `4.12.0`
[11:23:12] <d_bot> <a-c-sreedhar-reddy> and the build is also successful
[11:23:36] <d_bot> <a-c-sreedhar-reddy> But there is some issue with ocamllsp which is throwing this error.
[11:23:50] <d_bot> <Ulugbek> Oh, does the project use dune?
[11:24:41] <d_bot> <Ulugbek> Also, can you save the file to get updated diagnostics? If you compiled after you opened the file with the error, the error may simply be stale. When you save the file, you get fresh diagnostics
[11:27:09] <d_bot> <a-c-sreedhar-reddy> I do not think so. I am new to ocaml. This is the repo: https://github.com/rescript-lang/rescript-vscode/tree/master/analysis
[11:27:10] <d_bot> <a-c-sreedhar-reddy>
[11:27:11] <d_bot> <a-c-sreedhar-reddy> Tried editing the file and then running `make` But still the issue remians.
[11:28:21] <d_bot> <Ulugbek> Also, can you call vscode command from the command palette in vscode ‚Äúocaml: set sandbox‚Ä¶‚Äù and pick an appropriate sandbox
[11:29:21] *** Joins: mro (~mro@2002:5cc3:e43c:0:2162:556:1a86:2b34)
[11:29:58] <d_bot> <Ulugbek> Oh well the project uses compiler version 4.06 as expected. So you want to install that version of ocaml. You should be able to go to the project root and run ‚Äúesy‚Äù
[11:32:21] <d_bot> <a-c-sreedhar-reddy> But in the contribution docs it mentions it uses 4.12.0 https://github.com/rescript-lang/rescript-vscode/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#install-dependencies
[11:32:35] <d_bot> <Ulugbek> I‚Äôm not sure that‚Äôs the command esy to run actually. It seems to compile to JavaScript so it probably used npm or yarn.
[11:36:49] <d_bot> <Ulugbek> They have .merlin file with fixed 4.06, I‚Äôd talk to maintainers
[11:36:50] <d_bot> <Ulugbek> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/436568060288172044/906816952767496212/IMG_0302.png

[19:35:25] <d_bot> <a-c-sreedhar-reddy> Hi @RegularSpatula I was trying to hack on the ReScript vscode plugin.
[19:37:00] <d_bot> <Ulugbek> did you get it to work eventually?
[19:38:01] <d_bot> <RegularSpatula> makes sence...just checking.  I know that rescript uses an old version of ocaml compiler as you've run into.  i did manage to get an alternative toolchain set up to work on rescript ocaml stuff as well as normal...it's been a while, but have you set up a switch for that version of the ocaml compiler?
[19:40:34] <d_bot> <a-c-sreedhar-reddy> No @Ulugbek I had to go out, and came back just now.
[19:40:35] <d_bot> <a-c-sreedhar-reddy>
[19:40:36] <d_bot> <a-c-sreedhar-reddy> @RegularSpatula  In the contribution docs  it says to use 4.12.0 https://github.com/rescript-lang/rescript-vscode/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#install-dependencies
[19:41:32] <d_bot> <RegularSpatula> yeah i saw that
[19:41:45] <d_bot> <RegularSpatula> just reporting what I had to do (granted it was a while ago)
[19:43:20] <d_bot> <RegularSpatula> whenever doing anything from the ocaml side with rescript i have a switch setup for just that with the 4.06 compiler...then all the tooling works fine

[22:10:26] <d_bot> <Perry> Mostly because you‚Äôre clearly a real user and the other account has no public posts to this discord. But next time you should be a bit more careful about how you do a report.
