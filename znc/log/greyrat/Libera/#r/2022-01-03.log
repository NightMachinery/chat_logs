[12:49:57] <DrNostril> hi all
[13:01:35] <CuriousErnestBro> hi DrNostril 
[13:01:36] <CuriousErnestBro> what's up
[13:08:56] <DrNostril> not much
[13:09:26] <DrNostril> my mom was visiting me for the holidays... now she's gone... i'm working on a report for a late round job interview
[13:09:31] <DrNostril> it's going slowly but well
[13:09:40] <DrNostril> how about you CuriousErnestBro
[13:10:36] <CuriousErnestBro> im about to start studying for my econometric methods 2 resit, after that i'll apply to med school and tonight i'll start reading this trading systems development book
[13:10:55] <CuriousErnestBro> am using R library and they pulled a lot of examples from that book so I reckon it's a good starty
[13:10:57] <CuriousErnestBro> start
[13:11:07] <DrNostril> very nice
[13:11:30] <CuriousErnestBro> im noob at R but so far it seems like the javascript of the stats world
[13:12:54] <CuriousErnestBro> one weird thing, a char vector (i think) can have columns, but when you convert it with as.numeric() it becomes 1d 
[13:13:46] <CuriousErnestBro> so I'm doing x <- matrix(as.numeric(x), ncol = ncol(x))
[13:20:09] <h_m> how come your always resitting? i thought you had become top of the class now...or you in class of bums
[13:22:54] <DrNostril> we can be more encouraging than that
[13:23:20] <DrNostril> a vector is a vector... what's your actual question?
[13:32:40] <CuriousErnestBro> h_m that's from last year, 3rd sit to complete my bachelor
[13:32:59] <CuriousErnestBro> in my master i'm top of class (not quite but im getting good and that's all that matters)
[13:33:08] <CuriousErnestBro> i'm not losing sleep comparing myself to my classmates, not worth it
[13:34:10] <CuriousErnestBro> what are you up to h_m?
[13:35:28] <CuriousErnestBro> DrNostril when I click on the object I get columns labeld V1 V2 etc
[13:35:55] <CuriousErnestBro> why is that? how does R know there are columns?
[13:36:11] <DrNostril> screenshot? pastebin?
[13:36:57] <CuriousErnestBro> DrNostril http://0x0.st/osFN.png
[13:36:57] <CuriousErnestBro> running typeof(x) gives [1] "character"
[13:38:21] <CuriousErnestBro> it comes from here http://0x0.st/osFc.png
[13:38:29] <CuriousErnestBro> cont$data
[13:39:11] <CuriousErnestBro> but the top-right screen misspecifies the dimensions? http://0x0.st/osFT.png
[13:48:03] <CuriousErnestBro> vectors can be 2d? how is it different from matrix then?
[14:07:35] <DrNostril> well this is curious
[14:25:07] <DrNostril> ccccccrjituhciltghnhktrflgihniebjdchjrkfnrfd
[14:25:10] <DrNostril> oops
[14:25:43] <DrNostril> looks to me like that first image isn't a vector
[14:25:53] <DrNostril> each column is a vector, hence the V

[14:48:43] <CuriousErnestBro> well it says this: [1] "character"

[15:54:58] <fendur> i mean, from the user's perspective, it's often more important to consider the class, not the type
[15:55:06] <CuriousErnestBro> > class(as.numeric(coin))
[15:55:06] <CuriousErnestBro> [1] "numeric"
[15:55:14] <CuriousErnestBro> then why does it change when calling as.numeric()
[15:55:42] <fendur> probably because as.numeric() removed the dimensions.
[15:56:01] <fendur> i.e., made it a simple vector
[15:57:19] <fendur> i think you're right to convert a char matrix to a numeric matrix with matrix(as.numeric(...), ncol=...)
[15:58:20] <CuriousErnestBro> huh the documentation doesn't mention it
[15:58:35] <fendur> it may not be that common
[15:59:01] <fendur> i rarely need to do that
[15:59:35] <fendur> but it's happened and i did wish as.* would recognize it's a matrix
[15:59:56] <CuriousErnestBro> weird...
[16:00:05] <fendur> it would need a dispatch function for the matrix class
[16:00:18] <CuriousErnestBro> thanks for the affirmation
[16:00:19] * CuriousErnestBro googles dispatch function

[18:29:03] <Bayes> sup
[18:29:06] <DrNostril> i got a df with 201 rows and 8 columns... and another df with 29 rows and 2 columns... I want to replace all the values in df1 column 8 with the vlaues from df2 according to corresponding dates... what's the 1 liner i'm looking for?
[18:29:15] <DrNostril> also hi Bayes
[18:30:12] <Bayes> DrNostril is `date` the only column that matches both dfs?
[18:30:17] <DrNostril> yes
[18:30:26] <Bayes> if so, it'd try something along the lines of ...
[18:30:50] <DrNostril> i would write a for loop with an if statement but it feels dirty
[18:30:54] <Bayes> nooo
[18:30:59] <DrNostril> feels so dirty
[18:31:25] <fendur> sounds like a task for sqldf
[18:31:29] <Bayes> df1[smth, 8] <- df2[smth, some_column]
[18:31:33] <DrNostril> working on a project for a job app, want it to be clean and nice
[18:31:48] <DrNostril> is it really that easy?
[18:32:00] <Bayes> where smth is how you match dates, but I cannot think of the specifics cause no mwe
[18:32:02] <Bayes> yeah it is
[18:32:15] <DrNostril> okay it's gonna be a %in% statement
[18:32:26] <Bayes> the cleanest, R-way to do this is basically vectorization IMO
[18:32:47] <DrNostril> but one is weekly data and the other is daily
[18:33:05] <DrNostril> trying to match up the beginning of the weekly with the correct day in the big one
[18:33:20] <DrNostril> then probably use zoo to fill in the NULLs
[18:33:44] <Bayes> because basically what you're doing is: take df1row1, df1row2, df1row3, ... column 8 from df1 and put the values in df2row1, df2row2, df2row3 some_column
[18:33:57] <mefistofeles> Bayes: what about that smth?
[18:34:00] <mefistofeles> what's that?
[18:34:07] <DrNostril> ciao mefistofeles
[18:34:11] <mefistofeles> DrNostril: o/
[18:34:17] <Bayes> some expression to match the df columns
[18:34:34] <DrNostril> (df1$date %in% df2$date)
[18:34:39] <DrNostril> i think
[18:34:44] <Bayes> no
[18:34:49] <Bayes> cause those are true or false
[18:34:56] <Bayes> you probably want some which in there or something
[18:35:03] <eliocamp4> DrNostril the safest and "correctest" approach is a join, I think. 
[18:35:04] <Bayes> or maybe match
[18:35:05] <DrNostril> ah yiss
[18:35:09] *** eliocamp4 is now known as eliocamp
[18:35:12] <Bayes> match could be clever
[18:35:23] <DrNostril> *intense googling noises*
[18:35:32] <Bayes> eliocamp4 yeah that was my first thought when DrNostril said I have dfs, but actually they have time series
[18:35:38] <DrNostril> man i love this channel
[18:35:58] <Bayes> also also also zoo has some specific methods for going from some periodicity to others
[18:36:11] <DrNostril> normally people call me he/him, but actually we are many persons in here.....
[18:36:22] <DrNostril> zoo kinda rules
[18:36:27] <DrNostril> have used it a few times
[18:36:28] <Bayes> oh that's fine I just didn't want to assume
[18:36:33] <Bayes> as in "I have weekly data but the eow doesnt match"
[18:36:43] <Bayes> so you might actually have a neat one liner
[18:36:48] <Bayes> if you search the zoo docs
[18:36:50] <DrNostril> there definitely is one
[18:36:55] <DrNostril> somewhere
[18:37:16] <DrNostril> i feel like i have done this before? been searching through my old code but the xmas booze toasted mt brain
[18:37:36] <Bayes> how are you searching your old code?
[18:37:57] <Bayes> there's only one acceptable answer to that question o.o
[18:38:03] <DrNostril> click here, click there, consult passive memory, pet the dog, go back to the computer....
[18:38:05] <Bayes> I'm warning you before you actually answer it
[18:38:08] <eliocamp> I might 've not understood the issue. 
[18:38:19] <Bayes> wrong answer DrNostril go back to computing 101
[18:38:31] <DrNostril> well i think match and zoo are the reasonable tools
[18:38:39] <Bayes> only correct answer in the world: ripgrep :P
[18:38:57] <DrNostril> google.com site:github.com __name__ zoo
[18:39:24] <eliocamp> Perhaps the rolling joins feature from data.table can help you? 
[18:39:52] <Bayes> trying to match up the beginning of the weekly with the correct day in the big one -> as weekly, head ?
[18:40:25] <Bayes> not sure that will do exactly what you want to, but another approach is to mix and match as weekly with head or tail or what have you
[18:40:28] <h_m> are you trying to automatically impute something? sounds a terrible idea whether or not there is a package for it
[18:41:18] <Bayes> yay only a couple hours in the new day until we started judging your methods!
[18:42:20] <h_m> lol
[18:43:15] <h_m> s/automatically/automagically/
[18:48:29] <DrNostril> well i got a bunch of weekly google trends data and a bunch of daily information on the searched thing and i'm trying to combine them into 1 table
[18:48:32] <DrNostril> that's it
[18:48:39] <DrNostril> should be trivial but here we are....
[18:51:02] <h_m> think of 1:many or many:1 join if it helps...it would repeat weekly in each of the daily.
[18:52:55] <DrNostril> oh shit thats the best advice so far
[18:52:56] <eliocamp> DrNostril if you add a "week" column to the daily data and then join with the weekly data using that column as key, then you'll end up with daily data with the corresponding weekly data as another column. Would that work for you? 
[18:53:44] <DrNostril> sounds like it would
[18:54:01] <DrNostril> thanks everybody lol this is the deepest discussion ive seen here all day 
[18:55:06] <DrNostril> it's really just a join
[18:55:10] <DrNostril> no need for match or zoo
[18:55:24] <DrNostril> like this is actually very simple, but i'm more simple
