[19:42:19] <Orbstheorem> I've been so spoiled by NixOS and Arch that I had forgotten about long-outdated packages...
[21:07:44] <Orbstheorem> `ufw` est un truc ubuntu?
[21:07:45] <Orbstheorem> Ugh...
[21:08:37] <Orbstheorem> C'est pas compliqué ce que je veux: Je veux `iptables -I INPUT -i docker0 -m tcp -p tcp --dport 9000 -j ACCEPT`...
[21:08:53] <Orbstheorem> But I don't want to use multiple tools at the same time to do the same thing.
[21:09:10] <Orbstheorem> And to be fair `ufw allow 80/tcp` is much more readable than its iptables equlivalent.
[21:09:27] <Orbstheorem> Specially to my classmates who have never seen a line of iptables in their lives.
[21:12:46] * Orbstheorem oftentimes has problems with the 'simple' tools...
[21:18:58] <Orbstheorem> Hmm... I was trying `ufw allow in on docker0 from any port 12345`, which may work, but tcpdump says the packages are not coming through docker0, but rather a funny-named bridge created by docker compose...
[23:33:21] <afontain[m]> découverte du jour:
[23:33:28] <afontain[m]> > <@craftyguy:postmarketos.org> I use this to 'import' the env used by phosh to be able to run UI things from ssh: export $(cat /proc/$(pidof phosh)/environ | tr '\0' '\n')
[23:34:20] <afontain[m]> ne mettez pas ça sur un script de production, hein ;)
[23:35:12] <afontain[m]> c'est très exploitable
