[12:24:00] <Lindrian> Hehe, was comparing an old version of Me-mes regex
[12:24:40] <digitok> on a related note, you should add thousands separators to the step count

[12:26:06] <digitok> cool eh
[12:26:11] <digitok> no need to be rude
[12:26:20] <digitok> yw for the great idea
[12:26:52] <Lindrian> xD
[12:27:07] <Lindrian> I think regexing that is the easiest way
[12:27:42] <digitok> probably, assuming js doesn't have something built-in
[12:29:56] <NiLon> just make sure you use space as separator ;)
[12:30:11] <digitok> yea, no
[12:30:29] <NiLon> it's the least confusing
[12:30:45] <digitok> commas confuse you?
[12:31:10] <NiLon> yes, it is a decimal separator
[12:31:20] <digitok> not for me
[12:31:32] <NiLon> exactly my point
[12:31:53] <digitok> then you're currently confused by the match time output
[12:31:55] <NiLon> space is used only as thousand separator
[12:32:18] <digitok> and a word separator
[12:32:25] <NiLon> comma and dot is used as both, also the rule is different from country to country
[12:32:43] <digitok> yep, we'll go with comma
[12:33:11] <NiLon> and by rule I mean what counts as thousand
[12:33:23] <digitok> Lindrian, something like  (?!^)(?=(?:.{3})+$)  maybe
[12:33:31] <NiLon> 123,00 vs 12,300
[12:33:44] <Lindrian> International standard says , or . for thousands separator
[12:33:56] <NiLon> if you present 123,00 then some people think it is 12300 and some think it is 123
[12:34:10] <Lindrian> thats a cool regex digitok, i'll copy that
[12:34:49] <digitok> actually, yours had a good idea
[12:34:52] <digitok> \B(?=(?:.{3})+$)
[12:36:36] <NiLon> Lindrian "Spaces should be used as a thousands separator (1000000) in contrast to commas or periods (1,000,000 or 1.000.000) to reduce confusion resulting from the variation between these forms in different countries."
[12:36:47] <NiLon> from your international standard
[12:38:38] <digitok> cool, didn't know Lindrian made the international standard
[12:38:44] <Lindrian> :D
[12:40:27] <NiLon> you don't need to make something it to be yours
[12:41:11] <NiLon> and if you reference it for justification, then that is your system
[12:41:51] <NiLon> unless of course being a hypocrite

[12:43:50] <NiLon> comma is fine if the target audience is US only
[12:44:14] <Lindrian> I personally find comma easier to read in the UI
[12:44:23] <NiLon> intl has way of figuring that out from locale, but it is bit tricky to figure out proper locale
[12:44:25] <digitok> or the UK, or AU
[12:44:50] <NiLon> so as SI states, space is good compromise between every country
