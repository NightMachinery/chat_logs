[00:27:27] <LordKalma> foo, there's actually a django setting that adds a trailing slash when you enter a path without it
[00:27:37] <LordKalma> like if you give it /admin, it'll redirect to admin/
[00:27:41] <LordKalma> you can turn that off
[00:27:57] <LordKalma> but I don't remember if there is the setting to *remove* it, aka /admin/ to /admin

[03:52:20] <foo> nbjoerg: oh, BTW, I'm seeing this is debug mode... so I don't think that's relevant? I think collectstatic is for production only?

[03:55:07] <foo> nbjoerg: in incognito, nothing missing or odd in console. Thanks for the help troubleshooting. It looks like various columns have the "sticky" CSS class which is causing some odd behaviors because various parts of admin are sticking

[06:31:37] <Steve-Dusty> nobody was able to help me..
[06:31:58] <Steve-Dusty> I'm trying to deploy Django, but for some reason, django is unable to get into my .env file...

[06:52:01] <Steve-Dusty> dre look at the docs https://django-environ.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting-started.html
[06:52:08] <Steve-Dusty> it said to put it in the project dir
[06:55:17] *** Joins: dodobrain (~dodobrain@user/dodobrain)
[06:55:51] <dre> However, this is not the recommended way. When it is possible always specify the path tho .env file.
[06:57:46] <Steve-Dusty>  how do i do that??
[06:58:11] <dre> For details see “Multiple env files”.
[06:59:14] <Steve-Dusty> ok
[06:59:18] <dre> Steve-Dusty, you say "try to deploy" django; where precisely is that?
[06:59:30] <dre> is this your local, or VPS, or heroku or some docker container
[06:59:40] <Steve-Dusty> it doesnt work on VPS
[06:59:43] <Steve-Dusty> so im trying it on Local
[06:59:47] <dre> ok
[07:00:00] <Steve-Dusty> can you send link?
[07:00:04] <Steve-Dusty> i can't find "multiple env files"
[07:00:07] <dre> don't tell me what doesn't work, tell me what you're doing. you are on local, right?
[07:00:20] <dre> Steve-Dusty, I've been copy pasting from the site you linked me
[07:00:26] <dre> in FAQ
[07:00:27] <dre> first item
[07:01:31] <dre> Steve-Dusty, seems it's just "env.read_env('.env')"
[07:01:52] <Steve-Dusty> ```
[07:01:52] <Steve-Dusty> env = environ.Env()
[07:01:53] <Steve-Dusty> env.read_env(env.str("../", ".env"))```
[07:01:54] <Steve-Dusty> I did this
[07:02:02] <dre> nope
[07:02:30] <Steve-Dusty> so just `env.read_env('.env')` this?
[07:02:38] <dre> sure, that's better
[07:02:57] <dre> what could even better ( to help you debug ) is to specify the file exactly
[07:03:41] <Steve-Dusty> `env = environ.Env(
[07:03:42] <Steve-Dusty>     # set casting, default value
[07:03:42] <Steve-Dusty>     DEBUG=(bool, False)
[07:03:43] <Steve-Dusty> )`
[07:03:43] <Steve-Dusty> `env.read_env('.env')`
[07:03:50] <Steve-Dusty> this works
[07:04:31] <Steve-Dusty> im curious, how did you come up with `env.read_env('.env')`
[07:04:40] <Steve-Dusty> nowhere in the docs it showed that
[07:05:00] <dre> it doesn't /show/ that. it /says/ it. you need to /read/ not /look/
[07:05:03] <Steve-Dusty> Ohh, you just didn't specify file path
[07:05:11] <dre> the first item of the FAQ.
[07:05:15] <Steve-Dusty> Ok.
[07:05:20] <dre> no Steve-Dusty, your "../" is entirely wrong
[07:05:32] <dre> look at what it is trying to say
[07:06:12] <dre> env.str(    {get a string}       "../"     look for a string called "../" ? ??      ".env" default value
[07:06:34] <Steve-Dusty> `env.read_env(env.str("/etc/environment", ".env"))`
[07:06:40] <dre> nope
[07:07:03] <dre> Steve-Dusty, what is "env.str"
[07:07:04] <dre> what does it do
[07:07:47] <Steve-Dusty> string version of .env
[07:07:56] <dre> yep
[07:07:57] <Steve-Dusty> returns string version of .env
[07:08:08] <Steve-Dusty> ok so I don't need to add " "??
[07:08:19] <dre> so, what would     env.str("/filepath/to/somewhere")  do?
[07:08:29] <dre> tell me what that line of code is meant todo
[07:08:44] <dre> starting with "returns string version of env"
[07:08:54] <Steve-Dusty> wait, but it's already a strinmg
[07:08:55] <dre> note, not of ".env" but of env
[07:09:06] <dre> nope, close, you're losing it
[07:09:27] <Steve-Dusty> FINDS THE ENV FILE IN THE PATH??
[07:09:29] <dre> what about this, what does:    var = env("DEBUG")        do  ?
[07:09:58] <dre> sets var to whatever is in the environment for the key "DEBUG"       -- right? or not right ?
[07:10:28] <Steve-Dusty> YES
[07:10:31] <dre> ok
[07:10:47] <dre> then var = env.str("DEBUG")  does.. what?
[07:10:55] <dre> spell it out to me
[07:11:02] <Steve-Dusty> converts the value of DEBUG to string
[07:11:09] <dre> ok
[07:11:11] <Steve-Dusty> DEBUG = True
[07:11:13] <Steve-Dusty> DEBUG = "True"
[07:11:15] <dre> yep
[07:11:16] <dre> perfect
[07:11:18] <dre> NOW
[07:11:32] <dre> tell me what var = env.str("/etc/env") does
[07:11:46] <Steve-Dusty> FIND THE PATH OF THE .ENV FILE?
[07:11:50] <dre> nope
[07:12:04] <Steve-Dusty> oh, returns everything inside /etc/env
[07:12:24] <dre> how does "DEBUG" make it 'convert the value of debug to a string' but then using "/etc/env" makes it 'find the path of the .env file'
[07:12:34] <dre> it does the same thing no matter what string you give it
[07:13:05] <dre> so if originally, it does [[ converts the value of DEBUG to string ]]   but then we swap debug with a file path, the result is:
[07:13:19] <Steve-Dusty> it just shows what contains /etc/env
[07:13:24] <Steve-Dusty> in a string
[07:13:24] <dre> converts the value of "/etc/environment" to string -- which doesn't make sense
[07:13:29] <dre> nope.
[07:13:35] <Steve-Dusty> it converts the value of DEBUG to a string though
[07:13:40] <dre> yes.
[07:13:41] <Steve-Dusty> True => "True"
[07:13:47] <dre> beause "DEBUG" is a key
[07:13:49] <Steve-Dusty> so it should convert whatever inside etc/env to a string too
[07:13:55] <dre> Why should it?
[07:13:59] <dre> "DEBUG" is a key
[07:14:03] <Steve-Dusty> ok
[07:14:04] <dre> and the value is true
[07:14:24] <dre> is "/etc/env" a key?
[07:14:27] <Steve-Dusty> no
[07:14:30] <dre> wonderful
[07:14:39] <dre> so because it is not a key, it does not have a value
[07:14:45] <Steve-Dusty> yes
[07:14:51] <dre> and so env.str("/blah") does nothing
[07:15:20] <dre> likewise with env("/blah") and env.bool("/blah")
[07:16:18] <dre> so can you see what this line does? env.read_env(env.str("../", ".env"))
[07:16:26] <Steve-Dusty> Ok, I thought because env.str("DEBUG") returns the value inside the key (to string), then "/blah" would return the contents inside /blah to string
[07:16:32] <Steve-Dusty> it does nothing
[07:17:06] <dre> env-vars (key/values) are different to filepaths and files
[07:18:00] <dre> if you have `print(env('something'))` --- is it meant to print the value pointed by the key of 'something' or is it meant to read the file 'something' and return it's contents
[07:18:17] <dre> it would be an awful library if it did the latter
[07:19:08] <Steve-Dusty> ok
[07:20:14] <Steve-Dusty> https://github.com/Steve-Dusty/gameclip/blob/main/config/settings.py is this correct now?
[07:23:04] <Steve-Dusty> I'm using appliku
[07:27:09] <dre> env.str( ".env")
[07:27:12] <dre> what does this do
[07:27:35] <dre> also appliku looks p.nice
[07:28:45] <Steve-Dusty> nothing

[07:34:14] <dre> as a string type.
[07:35:44] <Steve-Dusty> but there's no value for .env
[07:36:01] <dre> yep, so it's nothing
[07:36:09] <dre> and you're saying env.read_file("")
[07:36:14] <dre> which means it won't read any file

[09:31:08] <Steve-Dusty> does anyone know what causes this `Dec 24 05:52:38 gameclip gunicorn[31914]: gunicorn.errors.HaltServer: <HaltServer 'Worker failed to boot.' 3>`?
[09:58:42] <pembo13> Steve-Dusty, does it happen randomly? Or is this on initial startup?
[09:58:55] <Steve-Dusty> when Im doing gunicorn status
[09:59:06] <Steve-Dusty> Is there a definitive guide to deploying django?
[09:59:12] <Steve-Dusty> im just looking at random tutorials online
[09:59:32] <pembo13> Steve-Dusty, did you review https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/howto/deployment/ ?
[09:59:46] <pembo13> Steve-Dusty, I recommend increasing the error logging output of Gunicorn
[09:59:55] <pembo13> and reviewing the logs generated by it

[13:09:25] <GinFuyou> If you want to use django special feautures like orm - you have to
[13:09:44] *** Joins: fikran (~fikran@user/fikran)
[13:12:15] <pycode> GinFuyou, ok i am getting very strange behavior, now it works i can use "spawn" with multiprocessing but i have noticed that something strange happen when i use a pandas Dataframe inside the code i am using in the workers
[13:12:29] <pycode> for some reason i see that the memory increase overtime
[13:12:46] <pycode> if i comment the line where i add columns to the dataframe i see nothing strange in memory
[13:13:07] <pycode> i know the database are huge (around 2GB) but when the worker ends its job it should clean the memory (i suppose)
