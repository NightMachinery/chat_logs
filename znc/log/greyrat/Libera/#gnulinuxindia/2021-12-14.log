[06:38:48] <Sayon[m]> <NeoVoid[m]> "see that white screen" <- install your graphics driver and xorg again maybe
[06:39:31] <Sayon[m]> also do you have a lot of stuff in your dwm bar script?
[07:23:16] <gtlsgamr> Check 
[07:23:30] <gtlsgamr> For the DRM kernel modesetting if you have nvidia
[07:30:17] <NeoVoid[m]> <Sayon[m]> "install your graphics driver and..." <- graphics driver? 
[07:30:17] <NeoVoid[m]> yeah whenever i try to play any game it complaints for missing gpl graphics because of that i couldn't play any game for about half a year. 
[07:30:17] <NeoVoid[m]> but how I know which package should install.
[07:30:25] <NeoVoid[m]> s/./?/
[07:31:03] <Sayon[m]> what graphics card?
[07:31:24] <Sayon[m]> dedicated or integrated?
[07:31:37] <Sayon[m]> s/what/which/
[07:32:41] <Sayon[m]> are you using 3d acceleration?
[07:35:27] <NeoVoid[m]> Sayon[m]: intel integrated i think
[07:36:21] <Sayon[m]> bruh
[07:36:28] <Sayon[m]> do you use your own system
[07:37:05] <Sayon[m]> install mesa and xorg-drivers
[07:37:08] <Sayon[m]> if on arch
[07:37:17] <Sayon[m]> probably lib32-mesa too
[07:43:18] <NeoVoid[m]> <Sayon[m]> "do you use your own system" <- i think i only installed this package xf86-video-intel xD
[07:43:42] <NeoVoid[m]> mesa is already installed
[07:44:23] <Sayon[m]> xf86-video-intel is deprecated
[07:45:21] <Sayon[m]> even i dont have it installed
[07:45:46] <Sayon[m]> install xorg-drivers and mesa

[07:45:50] <NeoVoid[m]> alright
[07:46:05] <NeoVoid[m]> xorg drivers i didnt installed
[07:46:12] <Sayon[m]> lol what
[07:46:20] <Sayon[m]> how does it include xf86
[07:46:30] <Sayon[m]> arch ok
[07:47:30] <NikunjChopra[m]> Everybody sounds like a super pro in this group. Do you all use arch?
[07:47:42] <Sayon[m]> no
[07:47:45] <Sayon[m]> i dont use arch
[07:47:48] <NeoVoid[m]> NikunjChopra[m]: arch is the noobest one
[07:47:52] <Sayon[m]> i have gentoo
[07:47:58] <NeoVoid[m]> use artix xD
[07:48:08] <Zardian[m]1> #fedora_gang
[07:48:31] <NikunjChopra[m]> Only different thing about artic is that it does not use systemd I guess
[07:48:35] <NikunjChopra[m]> I use MX21
[07:48:37] <Sayon[m]> yes
[07:48:42] <NikunjChopra[m]> Noob
[07:48:56] <NeoVoid[m]> NikunjChopra[m]: yep thats a chad/pro  thing
[07:49:00] <NeoVoid[m]> s/yep thats a chad/pro  thing/yep thats a chad/pro thing/
[07:49:42] <Sayon[m]> why people use artix
[07:49:45] <NeoVoid[m]> <Sayon[m]> "xf86-video-intel is deprecated" <- how that possible without it how xorg suppose to work
[07:49:47] <NikunjChopra[m]> üëçüèª
[07:49:56] <Sayon[m]> if you can go this deep install gentwo
[07:50:14] <Sayon[m]> source based distributions are super hit
[07:50:21] <Sayon[m]> s/hit/hot/
[07:51:02] <Arya[m]> I use arch because it just works :)
[07:51:25] <NeoVoid[m]> Sayon[m]: idk its super friendly community i think better than arch one which more dwells on elitist side. keeping all elitism to themselve. whreas in artix you distribute all cool stuff freely. like a diwali ke laddu.
[07:51:28] <NeoVoid[m]> * ke laddu. xD.
[07:51:41] <NikunjChopra[m]> What is this matrix telegram bridge and how did you do it?
[07:51:48] <NeoVoid[m]> * more dwells more on elitist, * ke laddu. xD.
[07:52:14] <Arya[m]> it just bridges telegram to #gnulinuxindia:matrix.org 
[07:52:32] <NeoVoid[m]> <Sayon[m]> "are you using 3d acceleration?" <- should i use 3d acceleration?

[07:52:53] <Sayon[m]> why the hell i cant click continue
[07:53:01] <Sayon[m]> NeoVoid[m]: no
[07:53:12] <NeoVoid[m]> why lol
[07:53:57] <Sayon[m]> because i dont use it and everything runs fine
[07:54:04] <NeoVoid[m]> (43/43) installing lib32-mesa                                           [########################################] 100%... (full message at https://libera.ems.host/_matrix/media/r0/download/libera.chat/c4565fcaf5baf777d64dbe8c4bc578d535f7652a)
[07:54:38] <NeoVoid[m]> these dependancies you were tallking about 3d acceleration right?
[07:57:09] <NeoVoid[m]> ok installed all drivers xorg-drivers, lib32-mesa, its time to reboot.
[07:57:30] <Sayon[m]> wait no
[07:57:38] <Sayon[m]> they are the xorg drivers for intel
[07:57:39] <Sayon[m]> lol
[07:58:01] <Sayon[m]> actually no
[07:58:14] <Sayon[m]> why tho i have a running dwm setup then

[08:13:34] <NeoVoid[m]> everytime i try to run any game even in browser it through webgl error
[08:27:50] <NeoVoid[m]> <Sayon[m]> "wait no" <- i removed xf85-video-intel and startx thrown red screen lol
[08:28:18] <NeoVoid[m]> like its bleeding
[08:53:52] <gtlsgamr> Opinion: there is no such thing as "noob" distro. Even pros use ubuntu and noobs use gentoo
[09:00:38] <vipul[m]> <gtlsgamr> "Opinion: there is no such..." <- kya baat.
[09:01:35] <PriyanshuRai[m]> <gtlsgamr> "Opinion: there is no such..." <- I use Arch btw
[09:01:43] <PriyanshuRai[m]> * I use Arch (btw)
[09:01:51] <telegram_8037364> <gtlsgamr> "Opinion: there is no such..." <- Opinion: boomers stick to good old distros like ubuntu even if they are pro
[09:43:51] <Sayon[m]> <NeoVoid[m]> "everytime i try to run any..." <- did u harden firefox?
[09:44:28] <Sayon[m]> <gtlsgamr> "Opinion: there is no such..." <- fax
[09:45:01] <relejek[m]> Observation: Pros want stability in system so they want more stable system after years of experimenting, so that they can work/develop what is most important to them. Noobs want bleeding edge systems coz the want to experiment and learn and also "new, shiny, precious, 'I use Arch BTW' " i.e. for internet clout.
[09:45:52] <relejek[m]> can't say why people use ubuntu though. the community is very welcoming for new people. thats all i have to say.
[09:47:48] <NeoVoid[m]> Sayon[m]: nope
[09:48:25] <Sayon[m]> relejek[m]: i use arch btw is cringe
[09:48:44] <Sayon[m]> more cringe than someone using garuda linux
[09:49:46] <relejek[m]> T_T i like using arch though. it's so feather light on my pc

[09:49:57] <relejek[m]> i don't brag about it but i like it.
[09:56:49] <Arya[m]> <relejek[m]> "i don't brag about it but i like..." <- same
[09:56:54] <Arya[m]> <Sayon[m]> "image.jpeg" <- üòÜ
[09:58:36] <relejek[m]> i feel like after the founder of arch left. gentoo community took it upon themselves to be chad purist of source builds.
[09:59:13] <relejek[m]> arch has become so noobie friendly since i had built it. dayum.
[10:01:34] <Arya[m]> didnt gentoo founder also leave to make funtoo
[10:04:09] <relejek[m]> as it feels after Griffin step down from arch leadership, current dev team is taking it slow and focusing on strengthening core for arch. and modernizing i guess.
[10:05:46] <Arya[m]> who was griffin
[10:05:53] <Arya[m]> judd vinet was thefounder
[10:07:02] <relejek[m]> yes my bad. vinet was the foudner. griffen was the lead untill 2020.
