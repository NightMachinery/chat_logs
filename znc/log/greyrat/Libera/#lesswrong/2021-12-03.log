[00:46:14] <catern> dear lazyirc, is there an EA equivalent of an index fund?
[00:46:22] <gwern> donating to givewell?
[00:47:11] <catern> hm, I'm not sure that's right, givewell just gives money to wherever they think it will be best used
[00:47:35] <catern> they don't split the money over all causes
[00:47:50] <catern> that's like investing in a hedgefund you think is particularly well managed
[00:48:28] <catern> or I guess, like investing in a VC firm/private equity
[00:48:38] <catern> since hedge funds are much more diversified than that
[00:48:46] *** Quits: src (~src@user/src) (Quit: Leaving)
[00:48:56] *** Joins: src (~src@user/src)
[00:50:57] <catern> the reason I say this is because I'm thinking about the "invest your money and donate later" strategy. suppose all you want to do with your money is maximally grow the whole economy. if you don't worry about capturing value produced by your investment, you have many more and likely better options
[00:51:52] <catern> so it seems like donating now should be good, but if you're donating to a specific thing, there's more risk that you might have greater impact later when you know how to target your money better
[00:51:53] <kuudes> rmmh, no we don't I agree, but it seems we can rule out it being better than delta
[00:52:27] <kuudes> and it is at least worse in that it likely reinfects like hot knife cuts butter, so I wanted to confirm Obormot\Arcturus has got their booster and won't get covid the third time
[00:52:36] <catern> so like, I guess I'm imagining an equivalent of buying equity/an index fund which is *not* worried about capturing the value produced by its investment
[00:52:50] <kuudes> the bad scenario or R~10-40 is now more probable with today's case data from there

[00:53:23] <galambo> hi
[00:53:24] <gwern> I think there's a lot you could say against it. for example, consider how Kelly underperforms simply betting 100% on the best ROI you have
[00:53:30] <kuudes> hi
[00:53:44] <galambo> kelly? what are you guys talking about?
[00:54:06] <gwern> the justifications for Kelly wouldn't make any sense in a charity context. you're not getting back your investment to reinvest in the next period, so maximizing log growth over time or whatever is not even wrong
[00:54:11] <catern> (not to be too capitalist about it, but I think the EA cause is equivalent to maximizing the wealth of humanity, which is basically maximizing the size of the economy if you ignore distribution. so that's why this effect would be good)
[00:55:10] <catern> gwern: sure, that seems true about Kelly
[00:55:51] <Obormot\Arcturus> kuudes: ... no? I wasn't planning to, remember?
[00:56:11] <galambo> gwern, what is wrong about saving up and investing all my money and then donating it when I die?
[00:56:16] <catern> gwern: but like, I'm thinking about Hanson's posts on how we can give a much greater gift to the future by saving and giving later
[00:56:35] <gwern> galambo: I'm not sure there is anything wrong with that
[00:56:48] <Obormot\Arcturus> kuudes: Do you have info about the reinfection thing
[00:56:50] <catern> seems like you should be able to outperform the returns of an index if you don't care about recapturing value
[00:57:15] <gwern> galambo: but if I were arguing that it was, I think I would focus on the expectation that charitable returns are going to diminish steeply over time, particularly as we are in a time of major danger/opportunity from AI & genetics
[00:57:52] <catern> (I'm not naming a specific strategy for how, but it seems like indexing strategies - of spreading donations over many places because of your uncertainty about which is best and how expensive it is to determine which is best - should apply in charity too)
[00:57:55] <catern> although...
[00:58:01] <gwern> (if AI fooms badly, your long-term perpetuity gets devoured by gray goo; if it fooms well, then there won't be anyone who really needs help)
[00:58:20] <catern> "how expensive it is to determine which is best" doesn't apply in charity I suppose - with an efficient market, it has to be expensive to find good ROI opportunities
[00:58:31] <gwern> I think the only reasons people 'index' charity, when they aren't literal billionaires, is desire to virtue signal and loss aversion
[00:58:33] <galambo> the givewell index
[00:58:47] <catern> but if you don't care about capturing value, in theory you should be able find opportunities cheaply - there's no equilibrium preventing it
[00:58:57] <gwern> (if I donate to both the children's christmas festival *and* the local opera, I get more signals than if I donated twice as much to just the christmas festival)
[00:59:09] <gwern> (log-perception)
[00:59:12] <catern> gwern: sure, but just because ineffective altruists do it doesn't mean it's automatically bad
[00:59:21] <catern> (those are bad reasons for it, of course)
[01:00:06] <gwern> and then there's also a weird sort of worry about "what if I donate 100% to the best charity I can find and then it doesn't work". well so what, it was still the best one in expectation and paid off the most across all worlds
[01:00:08] <catern> but still, it comes back to: seems like you should be able to outperform the returns of investing in market indexes, if you don't care about recapturing value
[01:00:10] <galambo> I think if we make a givewell index it will be overwhelmed by something stupid like an insect charity
[01:00:17] <gwern> it's not like you're going to go bankrupt if you donate to the wrong charity
[01:00:44] <gwern> and you're not bill gates. it's not like you're going to donate *too much* money to AMF
[01:00:46] <catern> gwern: okay, sure, so then I think those are strong arguments against investing-and-then-donating-in-the-future

[01:02:37] <catern> galambo: like I mentioned above, since there's no efficient market in charities, you should expect to be able to do that
[01:02:50] <gwern> (AMF HQ: SECRETARY: "Mr President! Huge news! catern donated $110 to us!" PRESIDENT: "My god. That means we can cover Zimbabwe, the Congo, South Africa, *and* Uganda.

[01:04:31] <galambo> in seriousness I think the most reliable way of improving the wellbeing of people is increasing the world gdp
[01:04:32] <catern> the core here is this very fundamental principle: you only invest in things where you think you can capture value
[01:04:42] <catern> it's why public good problems are problems
[01:04:49] <galambo> and the best way to improve the world gdp is investing
[01:04:56] <catern> saturn2: so the EMH doesn't say "there's no such thing as public goods"
[01:05:09] <saturn2> it's not about causing deflation it's about giving up the reward for whatever you did to earn that money

[01:06:39] <gwern> you aren't, tho
[01:07:04] <kuudes> and it is not milder, hospitalizations are rising at least as fast as cases compared to delta, but lag may mean they rise more than with delta
[01:07:04] <catern> it's actually totally plausible that I influence billions of dollars
[01:07:16] <saturn2> if you believe the EMH it shouldn't matter how much money the fed prints since everyone instantaneously adjusts their prices to compensate
[01:07:21] <catern> considering I work in finance
[01:07:35] <galambo> saturn2, I disagree
[01:07:36] <kuudes> so it seems we have ruled out it being milder. it spreads considerably faster, unsure yet if just 1.5x delta or R~20 or so
[01:08:00] <kuudes> it may be worse given so far most of infected are university students, ie not-old people
[01:08:05] <rmmh> R0 infinity
[01:08:16] <galambo> saturn2, the fed will have to push the brakes at some point, and when the fed does that the economy will be hurt
[01:08:32] <kuudes> there has been some speculation that maybe its R would not be much higher but its generation would be shorter
[01:08:48] <kuudes> as people seem to have given it to others just hours after they themselves have got infected

[01:21:49] <galambo> saturn2, treasuries and stocks are negatively correlated and both have positive long term returns. stocks zig when treasuries zag. but if inflation becomes bad and rates go up treasuries dont work as well

[01:22:13] <galambo> Filipepe, hi
[01:22:46] <saturn2> galambo: by what mechanism would this harm happen if it doesn't distort prices?
[01:22:51] <Gurkenglas> it'll be pretty sad if it turns out the entire brain implements trapped priors just so this one inaccurate belief can persist, and when you fail to trap that belief's prior, you get akrasiacs
[01:23:05] <kuudes> hmm
[01:23:10] <galambo> saturn2, this is akin to an investor in tesla being upset that elon is announcing he is selling his stocks. the investor still believes in tesla, but they think that what elon is doing is stupid
[01:23:35] <saturn2> that also contradicts EMH
[01:25:07] <galambo> saturn2, how so?
[01:27:09] <saturn2> it's impossible for any securities trade to be stupid under EMH, since every security is worth exactly its price
[01:27:39] <gwern> (although arguably Musk is the person who is best placed to bring information into the market and make the tesla price efficient by buying/selling...)
[01:28:15] <galambo> securities trades are not stupid
[01:28:19] <galambo> where did I say that?
[01:28:24] <Gurkenglas> i think the law says he's supposed to bring that information into the market by saying it
[01:28:30] <galambo> I myself am invested in securities
[01:28:47] <galambo> I have more money in securities than in the s&p 500

[01:34:25] <galambo> saturn2, I think my problem is not that elon sold his stock. the problem is elon announced he was selling his stock. so people panic sold because they knew elon was about to dump his stock.
[01:34:48] <galambo> the drop in value of tesla would have been less if elon did not make the thing so public
[01:34:52] <saturn2> if people panic sold then the EMH is not true
[01:35:03] <galambo> it is more stupid that he made that announcement *before* he sold the stock

[01:37:59] <galambo> so yes the emh is efficient in the sense that the market responded appropriately to elon's stupidity
[01:38:04] <galambo> but what elon did was stupid
[01:38:51] <galambo> if a financial professional does something stupid and loses billions of dollars the market will respond appropriately as per the emh
[01:38:56] <galambo> but what that person did was stupid
[01:38:57] <galambo> anyways

[04:02:45] <feepbot> teaching, which got people most of what you get in the first several ring fights, and most of what he got from blindfolded fighting practice, but with far less pain. We put on blindfolds and limited strikes to slaps and shoves. Of course, people still got hurt, but not like the ring, and we avoided some twisting motions on the victims (not medical advice). Pain itself is not such a
[04:02:50] <feepbot> good teacher. Pain, per se, is not any indicator of gain, even where the two seem closely associated. In the end, I am saying there is usually a better way to do it.'

[15:50:18] <Gurkenglas> Oh, that's not technically a win yet; but you may ask now instead of later if you'd like.
[15:50:39] <Gurkenglas> Or do you expect asking now to expend social capital with him?
[15:50:42] <PapuaHardyNet> agreed, he hasn't yet left his gf(now bf?) yet

[15:51:56] <Robomot> image/png (865x598; 64 KB)
[15:53:05] <PapuaHardyNet> honestly, I did *not* expect this to happen - I expect him to be the one to mess it up and get tired of her
[15:53:32] <PapuaHardyNet> if we agree on what he said as the truth, then it could also be that she's letting him down nicely hahah
[15:57:03] <Gurkenglas> The part of me that finds it appropriate that you would win from an unexpected-to-you direction because you happened to be on the pessimistic side of the bet is also insisting that this information doesn't resolve the bet. Though it sure changes expectations such that I would no longer make this bet :).
[15:58:19] <PapuaHardyNet> I agree - we can still wait until... April, I think? - and see how things go
[15:59:30] <Gurkenglas> One reasonable action now is that you receive the winnings now, but if it turns out I win you pay it back, plus my winnings, plus you reimburse the transaction fees thereby lost. But I expect that the numbers involved are too small for that to be worth it to you
[16:00:17] <PapuaHardyNet> transaction fees are in the order of cents for Monero :)

[16:03:49] <Gurkenglas> While that part is at the forefront of my mind, it would like to file a *complaint* that society's tax situation does not allow us to just go from "A owes B x$ and loses y$ transaction fees" to "A and B throw a coin on whether (A owes B 2x$ and loses y$ transaction fees)" >:(
[16:05:07] <PapuaHardyNet> I think the real question is what is the norm in the crypto community as to whether you refund the transaction fees or not
[16:05:42] <Obormot\Arcturus> "it was just perversion, not gender dysphoria" oh no
[16:05:43] <PapuaHardyNet> I don't think it is, as far as I can remember from merchant refund terms
[16:07:00] <Gurkenglas> it feels just to make whoever chooses the means of payment bear the transaction costs. that doesn't sound like the right incentive structure, though.
[16:08:01] <Gurkenglas> the transaction fee refund i first mentioned was just because it's the obvious thought to place the *additional* transaction costs that result from an early payout to he who benefits from that agreement modification
[16:08:34] <PapuaHardyNet> oh that's true
[16:09:16] <PapuaHardyNet> honestly, I think the cryptocurrency ecosystem sucks big time when it comes to UX and transaction fees. The only three cryptocurrencies I would actually practically use would be Monero, nano, and litecoin
[16:09:31] <PapuaHardyNet> all three have negligible trx fees, with nano having zero trx fees
[16:09:46] <PapuaHardyNet> also all three have really good official wallets
[16:10:16] <PapuaHardyNet> (correction, monero and litecoin have really good official wallets, idk about nano, I use some suckless golang cli wallet for it)
[16:10:22] <Gurkenglas> the "fair" default attribution of fees i see is that, since we didn't think about fees, we act as though fees did not exist, and then we are "surprised" by fees stealing from us some of the money as it is transferred.
[16:11:47] <Gurkenglas> and of course monero can make the fees look like they're stolen from the sender or the receiver; we should accept whatever judgement it makes, and very much not decide whether to use monero based on its choice there
[16:11:52] <Gurkenglas> corrigibility, yo.
[16:12:55] <feep> legalize agp
[16:13:06] <PapuaHardyNet> the sender is the one always paying trx fees though
[16:13:24] <PapuaHardyNet> and that is always written separately in the invoice
[16:13:34] <Gurkenglas> that's that, then; looks like i carry them.

[16:17:08] <feep> well, it depends on where you go I guess
[16:17:17] <Gurkenglas> oh, you mean the "oh no" reaction is one you wish didnt exist there
[16:17:28] <feep> well, the oh no reaction is fine
[16:17:37] <feep> there are uh. harsher reactions.
[16:17:50] <PapuaHardyNet> ehh, the cuter you are, the less harsh the reaction
[16:18:27] <feep> like, there's a reason agp people think they're trans, and it has a lot to do with people not even being able to tell them agp exists without being branded transphobic
[16:19:09] <feep> hence, legalize agp.
[16:19:15] <PapuaHardyNet> oh, you mean the reaction to people who talk about agp not those who indulge in it
[16:19:16] <Gurkenglas> of course the "oh no" reaction was, as far as i can tell, sympathy for Papua's friend who thought he had a gf.
[16:19:30] * feep shrugs
[16:19:49] <feep> I didn't think that far about it, but that seems like a weird categorization to make
[16:19:56] <PapuaHardyNet> no, he knew she was trans (well, had a cock). according to him, she is incredibly hot and he already lost his virginity to her
[16:19:56] <feep> like, why do you care what the label says
[16:20:13] <Gurkenglas> PapuaHardyNet, not what I meant
[16:20:30] <feep> PapuaHardyNet: he is incredibly hot*?
[16:20:33] <PapuaHardyNet> oh I see. the definition of gf confused me
[16:20:52] <feep> what is that even, double-deadnaming? undeadnaming?
[16:21:05] <PapuaHardyNet> cut me some slack :/
[16:21:16] <feep> XD I'm just teasing~
[16:23:09] <Gurkenglas> "it was just perversion, not gender dysphoria" oh no <- sympathy for Kaji as he realizes that the gender-dysphoric person that therefore likes him was actually a person with a perversion who therefore doesn't like him
[16:24:13] <Gurkenglas> i agree that the labelling is silly, and if these labels cause someone to like or not like someone then that is a small thing causing a large thing, aka unfair

[17:02:42] <PapuaHardyNet> what
[17:03:05] <PapuaHardyNet> there are two kinds of nodes, full nodes and non-full nodes
[17:03:18] <nshepperd2> Gurkenglas: i mean that some places the laws might not punish scams, or not very hard
[17:03:18] <Gurkenglas> PapuaHardyNet, why do you need to store 90 GB for a full node?
[17:03:24] <CoJaBo> Gurkenglas: You can't verify transaction history without having transaction history lol
[17:03:38] <Gurkenglas> CoJaBo, why do you need to verify more than the last GB of transaction history?
[17:03:41] <nshepperd2> like how robocalling is basically legal in the us
[17:04:05] <CoJaBo> Gurkenglas: Because then anyone could just create coins out of thin air as long as they referenced blocks older than that
[17:04:18] <PapuaHardyNet> just run a pruned node then
[17:04:31] <PapuaHardyNet> but for a pruned node you still need 75+GB yeah
[17:04:56] <Gurkenglas> Pruned sounds about right - it only keeps tracks of those coins that haven't been spent yet?

[17:08:01] <Gurkenglas> CoJaBo, could you simply believe every transaction you're told until someone else contradicts you? would take like 1 KB to keep track of your own wallets :3
[17:08:45] <PapuaHardyNet> what? just use a remote node, don't run your own node

[22:28:55] <feepbot> <gwern> 'For most of my teaching career, I was an economics professor at the Naval Postgraduate School. My students were generally motivated, reasonably hard-working military officers from the Navy, other US services, and other countries. I loved teaching them. But one day in the mid-1990s I told them a true anecdote whose shock value required them to know, for comparison, the
[22:28:55] <feepbot> population of the United States. I usually read students’ faces well and I saw little shock. I immediately wondered if they knew the US population. So I told them to write their estimate of the US population on a piece of paper and hand it in. At the time the US population was about 270 million. Finally there was a shocked face: mine. Although the median answer was within 10
[22:28:55] <feepbot> percent of the right answer, only about 40 percent of the students gave a number close to the median. The estimates ranged from—are you ready?—1.5 million on the low end to 2 billion at the high end. I pointed out that 1.5 million was close to the number of Americans in the armed services. So that would mean that almost everyone in the United States, including little babies and
[22:29:00] <feepbot> eighty-year-olds, was in the military. At the other end, I noted, 2 billion was about one-third of the world’s population.' https://www.hoover.org/research/what-are-you-afraid
