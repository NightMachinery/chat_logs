[05:05:46] <gilberth> I liked the part where he says that the masks are made with Photoshop. :)
[05:07:31] <gilberth> Meanwhile I listen to "simple mijads empirjaes aid daice" what ever that means.
[05:07:58] <gilberth> Na, "miids" it is.
[05:08:00] <hayley> Funnily enough, the only similarity between us (which does not include gilberth) and them is that the people who set pen to paper with the names first like Karl Marx. Otherwise it is quite different.

[05:10:11] <gilberth> Ah, licenses, licenses, more licenses.
[05:10:44] <hayley> We got the name first still.
[05:11:03] <gilberth> You patented the name?
[05:11:40] <hayley> No. But the collision would cause a lot of head-scratching.
[05:12:03] <gilberth> Sure, blame the tiny alphabet we have.
[05:12:14] <hayley> As, if you look around the other "discussions", they are focused on a binary view of the community. "You are in the community, thus you get the software. You are not in the community, thus we cannot sustainably give it to you."
[05:13:37] <hayley> Perhaps amusingly for you, our very-copyleft ethics have us give out the software freely, and I have written that "the community" is not something that can be observed like that.

[06:49:03] <hayley> {gilberth}: Which north/south did you say was the more reactionary again?
[06:49:44] <{gilberth}> Reactionary? In what specific sense?
[06:50:02] <hayley> idk, you say there is more of a north/south divide.
[06:50:57] <{gilberth}> The south is catholic and much more religious than the protestant north.

[07:05:01] <{gilberth}> See.
[07:06:26] <hayley> So I should occupy the jukebox?
[07:07:06] <{gilberth}> Could have helped. What were you supposed to chat about?
[07:07:21] <hayley> Not sure.
[07:07:48] <hayley> Though I have a habit of trying to fill time when people are doing literally nothing.
[07:08:28] <{gilberth}> So you want to become an entertainer, when you're grown up?
[07:08:47] <hayley> Not likely.
[07:09:11] * hayley is working through what a conflict with this wankery about a "community" would look like.
[07:09:12] <{gilberth}> Well, you play music, forgot?
[07:09:26] <hayley> I wouldn't do it for money.
[07:09:43] <{gilberth}> Who said it would be for money?
[07:09:54] * hayley shrugs
[07:10:11] <{gilberth}> I mean, I consider myself a hacker, but don't get money for it.
[07:10:37] <hayley> Yeah, you retired already.
[07:10:58] <{gilberth}> Yes, /me is olde.
[07:12:04] <hayley> So, the problem (which happens frequently enough to care btw) is that I want some feature, but the rest of the community doesn't. Would they rather: put up with me, or kick me out at the first sign of trouble.
[07:12:46] <hayley> If you do the usual thing of forking and doing it yourself, and your code gains any popularity, then they will just vote you out and you are now breaking their EULA^WCooperative License.
[07:13:51] <{gilberth}> What a shitty license then. And who is it, who governs?
[07:14:11] <hayley> The "community", i.e. the author and people who agree with them perfectly.
[07:14:52] <{gilberth}> Do I "own" my code, once I release it?
[07:17:13] <hayley> On paper, no, it is supposed to belong to that gated community, but IMO yes.
[07:19:37] <{gilberth}> Oh dear. So there is an owner, you say?
[07:21:32] <hayley> Yes, the first person still owns it, and can do so forever. Proof: the first person invites only people who are not going to cause any trouble. At the slightest sign of trouble, they vote to kick out the troublemaker (ideally before they can do anything with "reason", so that it will be unanimous).
[07:23:08] <hayley> Thus I would rather say "I own this code, but you can use it how you like, and claim ownership on that, as long as you follow the same principle." i.e. what I call "an abstract free software".
[07:24:52] <hayley> There is no need to have a reified "community", or a vote, because there is no barrier to moving or hacking it yourself.
[07:27:40] <{gilberth}> Hmm, why the hassle?
[07:28:36] <hayley> Because the usual approach apparently "isn't sustainable", which I assume means "doesn't make me any money".
[07:29:51] <{gilberth}> So it's about money?
[07:30:02] <hayley> Pretty much.
[07:30:17] <{gilberth}> Oh dear.
[07:30:51] <hayley> n.b. the Telekommunist lineage isn't about making money. Quite the opposite, as it is about not making bullshit money.
[07:31:04] <hayley> Again, the only similarity is that the original authors both like Karl Marx.
[07:32:05] * hayley uploaded an image: (30KiB) < https://libera.ems.host/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/SDdzYYZcuEOmEjRHYYDFbdch/Screenshot%20from%202021-08-16%2010-10-55.png >
[07:32:24] <hayley> See this image for sustainable being used as "doesn't make me any money".
[07:32:28] <{gilberth}> Well my view about all that is different, when you could get rich by using my code, I'll congratulate you.
[07:33:28] <{gilberth}> Why is it "Members" with a capital "M"?
[07:33:29] <hayley> IMO remix culture/free software/etc makes it a hard problem. Say, the hammer company wouldn't ask for a share if you used their hammer to build a prototype of a device which made millions.
[07:34:27] <{gilberth}> Indeed.
[07:34:48] <hayley> But OTOH if you copied someone's song and just change some words/chords/not a lot then that someone might ask for some royalties.
[07:35:27] <{gilberth}> By law, yes. Doesn't make it right though.
[07:35:31] <hayley> {gilberth}: Legalese pretty much.
[07:36:15] <hayley> What I mean by reification of the community, in a way. These people are Members. These people are not Members. The latter cannot use our Source Materials.

[07:37:50] <hayley> Right, even that is tricky. So the telekommunist "kludge" is that, if you are fine with giving it for free again, then you can have it for free. Else, prepare to write some checks.
[07:39:02] <{gilberth}> So it's still about money? Why does money matter at all?
[07:39:32] <hayley> Because, I dunno, humans decided they need money to survive.
[07:40:20] <{gilberth}> Yes, but then find someone who pays you.

[07:53:55] <{gilberth}> hayley: What would not happen? The discussion?
[07:55:01] <hayley> Yes, you wouldn't say "don't expect me to contribute then", just as you wouldn't say "don't expect me to plant a German flag on Jupiter", because it clearly won't happen.

[07:57:20] <{gilberth}> Really? What would I need to do? Poll?
[07:57:40] <{gilberth}> The good olde days we had mailing lists.
[07:57:42] <hayley> Okay, got it on text: "Users pay for Membership, which lets them use the software and file issues."
[07:58:03] <hayley> You do nothing, because you aren't getting any source code, and let's be honest, you probably pirated that shit.
[07:58:35] <{gilberth}> Ah, ok.
[07:59:05] <hayley> That is, of course, if you found an urge to use the software, because there is no way in hell they are going to write anything good.
[07:59:07] <dave0> i used to have linux from scratch where you build literally everything from the ground up from source code
[07:59:24] <dave0> i looked at the actual source code for all those packages zero times
[07:59:52] <dave0> sometimes having source code doesn't mean squat
[08:00:09] <{gilberth}> hayley: So then, what is the difference then from a commercial license?
[08:00:15] <hayley> I also think there is a correlation between "thinks this is a good idea" and "writes shitty code". For example, the comment yesterday on throwing out all code, and that the intro to the ACSL says source access can cause security issues.
[08:00:28] <hayley> {gilberth}: Some hand waving about communities and cooperatives.
[08:00:49] <hayley> It is a commercial license. The people involved speak like commercial actors. They write like commercial programmers.
[08:01:02] <{gilberth}> dave0: Imagine you wanted to read every single line of the source for any reasonable Linux distribution. How long would you need?
[08:01:23] <dave0> {gilberth}: like 1,000 man-years
[08:01:31] <{gilberth}> hayley: Ok.
[08:01:48] <dave0> isnt just linux kernel about 15,000,000 lines?
[08:01:55] <hayley> On a similar note, there is also the assumption that no one needs source code cause few people program. That could change easily if they wrote good code, or if there weren't so many gates involved.
[08:02:11] <{gilberth}> dave0: It used to be like 30,000 :)
[08:02:20] <hayley> So I wouldn't be surprised if there were a "conspiracy" to keep people uninformed, so that they can get away with it.

[08:15:22] <dave0> magic number AND a semi-useless comment
[08:15:44] <{gilberth}> It always depends. Is 32 a magic number, when talking about character codes?
[08:15:57] <dave0> {gilberth}: you just want more spaces :-p
[08:17:30] * lotuseater looks now again in TAoCP3 for shell sort
[08:18:05] <lotuseater> hayley: be grateful your ex code could talk with you about such stuff :)

[08:19:38] <lotuseater> but I know shellsort is in Algorithms by Sedgewick indeed
[08:22:17] <lotuseater> ah Algorithm D in 5.2.1
[08:28:53] <lotuseater> i should sleep a bit
[08:31:29] <kakuhen> (loop do stuff until something) ; does stuff, a lot, until  something
[08:32:52] <lotuseater> or "have fun with the causing side effects"
[08:36:58] <lotuseater> int main() {} // the main function, empty now, so doing nothing, you shouldn't try to compile this big program
[08:38:42] * hayley is now moderator of some discord server.
[08:38:48] <lotuseater> ooh
[08:38:59] <hayley> There is an #onboarding channel. Fine. There is an #outboarding channel, with the topic "stfu, idiot"
[08:39:41] * hayley uploaded an image: (3KiB) < https://libera.ems.host/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/dqgYjtgBBAsEyKIplmZckuVP/Screenshot_2021-08-16_14-15-07.png >
[08:40:15] <lotuseater> I'm not into Discord.
[08:40:46] <hayley> Well, they send you to a room with topic "stfu idiot" before being banned.
[08:41:04] <lotuseater> did you make progress with DOOM the last days? I should keep on with Eternal sometime.
[08:41:29] <hayley> I had finished it. Felt a bit short, but I played it for 20 hours or so. And I didn't find that many secrets.
[08:41:36] * lotuseater bans lotuseater
[08:42:13] <kakuhen> im not into discord either
[08:42:23] <lotuseater> oh yes the secrets ... John Romeros favorite part about DOOM 1 afaik
[08:42:38] <kakuhen> but it seems to be the canonical platform for ... i should probably think of a good way to say it first
[08:42:59] <hayley> xXx_EPIC 420 GAMERS_xXx
[08:43:14] <lotuseater> soso xXx ..
[08:43:37] <lotuseater> sounds EPIC
[08:44:08] <kakuhen> that compresses my original information too much
[08:44:17] <kakuhen> but yes they usually play video games, too
[08:44:28] <hayley> Lossless or lossy compression?
[08:44:38] <kakuhen> it is lossy
[08:44:51] <hayley> Damn.
[08:45:16] <kakuhen> OK my mind finally got the right words
[08:45:29] <kakuhen> it's the canonical platform for PMing sharing your crossdressing pics with other crossdressers.
[08:45:59] <hayley> Hm, I only met one femboy who posted pics on Discord.
[08:46:34] <lotuseater> as long as it's not offending
[08:47:50] <kakuhen> hayley: looks like i'm in my own bubble then :x
[08:48:04] <kakuhen> i'm on my 3rd alt account because my 2nd one got banned for using an alternative discord client
[08:48:14] <{gilberth}> lotuseater: You miss the '@' hat here, you can't ban yourself.
[08:48:35] <kakuhen> the 1st one i deleted because i did the mistake of adding annoying people
[08:48:45] <hayley> kakuhen: That implies you've been sharing pics, I guess.
[08:48:50] <kakuhen> correct
[08:49:22] <hayley> Nothing bad about that. Though I'll need a few years before I show anything more than blurry conference call footage.
[08:50:36] <kakuhen> tbh i'd probably use discord more than once a week or two to post pics if it didnt eat my RAM and battery
[08:50:55] <lotuseater> sad
[08:50:57] <kakuhen> but keeping the client running in the background somehow halvens the battery life of my laptop
[08:51:09] <kakuhen> and they do not allow alternative clients -- i learned this the hard wa.
[08:51:14] <kakuhen> the hard way.*
[08:52:30] <lotuseater> this is not good

[09:31:57] <kakuhen> what a net split x.x
[09:33:41] <{gilberth}> Announced. Actually I wonder, why I'm still here.
[09:33:55] <moon-child> IRC is a distributed system.  There are lots of different servers; everybody is connected to one of them, and they relay messages to one another
[09:34:09] <moon-child> sometimes, some group of servers stops being able to talk to another group of servers
[09:34:11] <moon-child> (see: CAP theorem)
[09:35:18] <kakuhen> this reminds me of a temporary netsplit a few months ago
[09:35:28] <kakuhen> all the channels i was in, i lost access to like 95% of the users in them
[09:35:44] <{gilberth}> Well, I got notice that they wanted to re-route and restart. The others will appear again.
[09:37:22] <{gilberth}> But at times, I ask myself "Is it me being left cut-off or all the others?" Philosophical question, I know.

[11:50:46] * hayley reads someone saying locks and semaphores are "low level". Compared to mailboxes and actors, sure. Compared to atomics and designing fine-grained locking, nope.
[11:53:28] <dave0> hayley: semaphores are my favorite
[11:56:35] <dave0> the interface is glorious.. what could be simpler than a single word in memory
[12:06:08] <{gilberth}> CCL is funny, as it uses Mach semaphores. This is outside of BSD and thus you can't use kevent(2) on them. And yes, I like them too.
[12:06:34] <hayley> So, ATOMIC-INCF/DECF in a trenchcoat (with a wait-queue hiding somewhere else, if you like to timeshare?)
[12:07:58] <{gilberth}> Kind of, yes.
[12:09:36] <hayley> Speaking of, if I ever want to write real threaded code on the Pi Pico, I need a way to make a mutex without atomic compare-and-swap.
[12:10:35] <{gilberth}> That Pi Pico doesn't have that? Anything else you could use?
[12:11:26] <hayley> Indeed. So I am reading <https://lamport.azurewebsites.net/pubs/mutual2.pdf> which rather describes something with only mere reads and writes.
[12:11:45] <hayley> Also note it is cache-less (all SRAM, so who cares?) so I assume any read or write to be immediately visible.
[12:15:15] <{gilberth}> Hmm. Is it multi-core?
[12:16:16] <hayley> Yes, two cores.
[12:17:42] <{gilberth}> So you say that anything hits just the SRAM? No caches at all? No write buffers? No IFU? How made they the RAM so fast, that it could serve two cores then?
[12:18:21] <hayley> Correct. But there is like 300K of SRAM, and it is "merely" dual-port 133MHz or so. Seems pretty comparable to, say, some L2 cache.
[12:18:39] <hayley> Well, except the L2 cache is way faster.
[12:19:07] <{gilberth}> What's the clock rate of the CPU?
[12:19:36] <hayley> I could extend the design to M cores and N threads, requiring only M "flags" and somewhere to stash the thread object, provided we don't interrupt between acquiring the lock and stashing the thread object.
[12:19:45] <hayley> Some 133MHz or so. Nothing amazing relatively speaking.
[12:20:44] * hayley reads Figure 4: The N!-Bit FCFS Algorithm and wonders how fair the damn lock has to be.
[12:21:25] <{gilberth}> You're too young. 4MHz was a fair clock rate once. And in nid 90s all were envy of my PPro 200MHz :-)
[12:21:52] <{gilberth}> mid, even.
[12:22:10] <hayley> Yes, my first machine was a clambook G4 iBook, some 700MHz or so.
[12:22:20] <{gilberth}> Anyhow, I wonder if the dual port nature of the SRAM could interfere.
[12:22:58] <{gilberth}> You grew up with a Mac?
[12:23:05] <hayley> lol no, some 300MHz G3 rather.
[12:23:10] <hayley> Indeed.
[12:24:50] <hayley> Got it in 2004 from my uncle, so it was a bit olde then.
[12:24:52] <{gilberth}> hayley: BTW the '181 seems to get scarce. I find none in the EU.
[12:25:26] <{gilberth}> Still 300MHz sounds like a fair machine.
[12:49:21] <shka> powerpc
[12:49:29] <shka> right?
[12:49:58] <shka> which means that it is kinda toasty 
[12:52:58] <shka> and underpowered cooling is currently tradition of the apple 
[12:55:31] <shka> well, it was for a while actually 
[12:55:34] <shka> since the 90s 
[12:56:42] <hayley> Hm, IIRC only G5 was notably toasty.
[12:57:00] <hayley> It got defenestrated in 2010, so I can't remember how hot it got.
[13:05:59] <kakuhen> PaperPC can get quite hot
[13:06:39] <kakuhen> also i vividly remember people with G5 quads or whatever model reporting leaks of some green fluid that was apparently coolant

[13:08:01] <dave0> i didn't and i regret it every day
[13:08:01] * hayley hopes the answer isn't no
[13:08:45] <hayley> This person thinks CLOS was only made to match the 80s hype of OOP. Which is funny since e.g. Flavors predates that by a while. And then the advice comes from, what, Interlisp...
[13:09:31] <kakuhen> "CLOS bad because 80s OOP bad because 80s computers slow or something, qed"
[13:09:46] <kakuhen> the same rationale some unix weenies have against garbage collectors
[13:09:55] <kakuhen> they seem to be stuck in the 90s 
[13:10:32] <hayley> Dear Clojure liberals, if CLOS is a hack, why did they write the best OOP book of the decade (The Art of the Metaobject Protocol) about it
[13:10:45] <kakuhen> omg
[13:10:52] <kakuhen> how will the clojure fanboys ever recover from this
[13:10:59] <hayley> Curious.

[13:21:21] <kakuhen> ck_: that messes with my brain in several ways
[13:21:50] <kakuhen> in math (f1 ○ f2 ○ f3)(a) would be the opposite of what (-> a f1 f2 f3) does
[13:22:08] <kakuhen> i sometimes get into heated debates with one of my friends who does composition in reverse and says me and everyone else does it "in reverse"
[13:22:52] <kakuhen> in any case I like the brevity of ->
[13:23:15] <kakuhen> in some common lisp code i wrote last night, I used alexandria:compose, and that still wasn't enough, because I had to funcall it
[13:23:44] <kakuhen> err rather, do something like (apply (alexandria:compose (car some-list-of-functions)) x)
[13:30:40] <selwyn> i have heard that reverse polish notation is popular in german maths departments
[13:30:57] <selwyn> i get why they do it
[13:32:00] * hayley uploaded an image: (199KiB) < https://libera.ems.host/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/uLeWvhyDPCiyuBrCmpVbMwiU/turning-point-applied-language.jpeg >

[13:34:13] -ixelp- Alan Kay at OOPSLA 1997 - The computer revolution hasnt happened yet - YouTube
[13:34:24] <kakuhen> also since the game im working on pulls in tons of libraries already, I decided to check out if alexandria had anything
[13:34:31] <kakuhen> turns out it already did, so i just use alexandria:compose now
[13:34:45] <selwyn> i prefer writing mathematical expressions in prefix notation
[13:35:18] <kakuhen> i just attempt following the conventions i see used in my classes and textbooks and then modify some pieces of notation for my own convenience
[13:36:15] <kakuhen> i guess if you care a lot about computation then it may be better to just do everything with reverse polish notation or whatever
[13:36:23] <kakuhen> but i'm not that kind of person
[13:37:23] <kakuhen> the nice part about RPN compared to the usual notation is that it's much harder to produce ambiguous expressions, if not impossible
[13:38:22] <kakuhen> but in practice this usually nly matters for facebook math problems like 2÷2(1+1)=????? and then people fight on for hours about how to interpret an obelus
[13:39:08] <ck_> selwyn: like as in \int \mathrm{d}t [expression] ?
[13:39:16] <hayley> The variable 2÷2 is unbound.
[13:41:39] <selwyn> kakuhen: i like prefix notation for the same reason
[13:41:50] <kakuhen> ck_: that's a notation i see physicists do a lot for some reason and i never understood it
[13:41:58] <kakuhen> i forgot the reasons i was told 3 years ago
[13:42:13] <kakuhen> i have a very strong opinion on integration however
[13:42:45] <kakuhen> (if it's not a stochastic integral then it's not very interesting)
[13:43:24] <selwyn> first time i saw that our lecturer was surprised and told us ´well we do it like that when we are not at school anymore, idk why´
[13:43:57] <kakuhen> iirc the reason was something along the lines of "we are more about the expression than our choice of coordinates" etc etc
[13:44:42] <kakuhen> my memory is failing me, and im not sure if that's true anyway, because you get alphabet soup very easily the moment you do any geometry and introduce coordinates somewhere
[13:44:53] <kakuhen> (just look at christoffel symbols, also jokingly called "christ awful symbols")
[13:48:00] <selwyn> physicists often have to care about the choice of coordinates when they have to solve a problem
[13:48:06] <selwyn> so i don´t get it either
[13:51:29] <hayley> I am going to make a pure message-passing OO Lisp and no one can stop me
