[00:02:11] <Z-module> right, you need x != a, same as  0 < |x - a|
[00:02:21] <cuppajoeman> ok thank you
[00:05:12] <Z-module> I would state this as:  Since f(x) >= M > L for all x in the domain, then for any x != a in the domain,   |f(x) - L| = f(x) - L >= M - L, so there's no punctured interval around a in which all the x give  |f(x) - L| < M - L.  So eps = M - L  has no possible positive delta.
[00:06:02] <Z-module> In other words, get rid of as many absolute values as quickly as possible, for a more easily readable proof. Here we can because M is a global min.

[00:09:30] <Z-module> in fact  |f(a) - L| = f(a) - L >= M - L   as well, but we don't need this fact

[01:43:15] <int-e> omnisip: so you want to compute 10*10*10 - 9*6*6?
[01:43:39] <omnisip> no, I want the dimensional spaces available
[01:44:07] <omnisip> 10*10*10-9*6*6 == the amount cubic space available without respect to any dimensions

[01:46:05] <omnisip> I think that''s on the right track.  Do polyhedrons support disjoints?  (i.e. if by some odd situation, I had enough boxes into the bigger boox where there are two open spaces with no continuities?
[01:47:10] <CuriousErnestBro> well var(X‚Çú‚Çä‚Çõ - X‚Çú ‚à£ X‚Çú) = var(X‚Çú‚Çä‚Çõ|X‚Çú) + var(X‚Çú|X‚Çú)

[03:13:18] <qergle> does the book say G isn't a function?

[03:13:41] <biberao> then on detailed it says it is
[03:19:22] <toretto> In probability, what does the power mean? Like here: https://gcdn.pbrd.co/images/5gdJfZQD8OAG.png?o=1
[03:19:40] <CuriousErnestBro> toretto the C means "complement"
[03:19:52] <CuriousErnestBro> so it is "everything except"
[03:20:08] <toretto> I see, so it's like (A \cap B)' ?
[03:20:16] <toretto> same as this one right?

[05:31:08] <biberao> right
[05:31:11] <biberao> that i understood
[05:31:17] <biberao> what i dont get is interval notation
[05:31:44] <qergle> they use [a,b] to mean closed (including a,b)
[05:32:00] <qergle> and reversed bracket to mean open so [a,b[ means include a but not b
[05:32:15] <qergle> i like [a,b) more for open b
[05:32:24] <biberao> is this right [-1,0]U[0,+inf[?
[05:32:34] <biberao> or actually
[05:32:39] <biberao> is this right [-1,0]U]0,+inf[?
[05:32:47] <qergle> no that's not right
[05:32:52] <biberao> then?
[05:33:27] <qergle> you need to find out when x(x^2+2x+1) is non-negative
[05:33:55] <qergle> the last one was x(x-1)(x+1), this one is x(x+1)(x+1)
[05:34:02] <qergle> solve it the same way
[05:35:09] <qergle> this one is actually simpler than the last one
[05:36:02] <biberao> like
[05:36:05] <biberao> i did the sign table
[05:36:14] <qergle> for x and (x+1)^2?
[05:36:16] <biberao> yes
[05:36:36] <biberao> <-1 = negative then negative again >0 positive
[05:37:01] <qergle> what>?
[05:37:11] <biberao> sorry?
[05:37:19] <qergle> i don't understand what that means
[05:37:26] <qergle> "<biberao> <-1 = negative then negative again >0 positive"
[05:37:56] <biberao> like [0,+inf[ <= positive
[05:38:06] <qergle> yes
[05:38:37] <qergle> i agree for [0,inf[ it's non-negative (not positive)
[05:38:43] <biberao> right
[05:39:06] <biberao> positive doesnt include the zero right
[05:39:10] <qergle> right
[05:39:15] <biberao> ok
[05:39:44] <biberao> then frm -1 to 0 its nonpositive
[05:39:47] <biberao> correct term?

[05:41:09] <biberao> my bad
[05:41:16] <biberao> but why {-1}
[05:41:16] <qergle> ok, that looks good.
[05:41:29] <qergle> because at x=-1, (x+1)^2=0
[05:41:30] <biberao> is it because "we discard below it?"
[05:41:40] <qergle> and 0*anything is 0, so it satisfies being ‚â•0

[11:18:09] <toretto> I don't. I know to prove P(A') = 1-P(A); and the other ones I found using de-morgan's rule.
[11:19:11] <greenbagels> ok, that gets you the first two rather directly; but the last 2 don't end in (1 - ...) on the right, so maybe try going through those again

[11:33:05] <greenbagels> because probabilities are nonnegative
[11:34:54] <greenbagels> one fun thought that i will put out there is that all of these identities are basically the same thing up to some relabeling and basic set theory / properties of P

[12:03:48] <greenbagels> You should get first, from relabeling A^c <-> A in (1), that P(A u B^c) = 1 - P(A^c n B)
[12:05:27] <JimmyRustles> another random walk question, if you have a random walk that has a 1/1000000 chance of walking back to the centre on every iteration, will that tend towards staying around the centre?
[12:05:32] <JimmyRustles> im guessing yes
[12:05:50] <JimmyRustles> by centre i mean starting point, sorry
[12:05:56] <toretto> greenbagels: I'm looking for a final result. like, in terms where ^c doesn't occur.
[12:06:31] <greenbagels> then you gotta get creative with simplifying P(A^c n B)

[16:43:19] <river> so the pullback is the initial object in that category
[16:43:30] <thecommieduck> isn't it the final?
[16:43:44] <river> oh perhaps, i always mix up limits vs colimits
[16:44:10] <thecommieduck> something is telling me that maybe this level of abstraction is unique to aluffi
[16:44:29] <river> yes, terminal object. thank you for the correction!
[16:45:00] <river> this is common in category theory - instead of doing each limit as a special case you can construct a category theory that has that limit as the terminal object

[16:45:44] <thecommieduck> yep, I can see that - but I'm guessing you don't then need to talk about the ambient (?) category C_{f, g} normally?
[16:46:47] <thecommieduck> we can say that this limit is the terminal object with regards to Set, knowing full well that actually the objects aren't Sets but are limits or whatnot
[16:47:25] <river> not quite - the limit is not a terminal object in set, it's a pullback in set - but it's a terminal object in the category of cones over the pullback digram
[16:48:09] <river> because a single object in that category (C_{f, g}) is a whole complex of objects and maps (when you think of it in C)
[16:48:20] <thecommieduck> it's a terminal object in the category of cones, /but/ we don't need to explicitly mention the category of cones; we can talk about it being a construction (a pullback in this case) related to Set

[16:48:32] <river> yeah
[16:49:26] <thecommieduck> yeah that makes a lot more sense now; everything I read online takes that approach (a pullback in set...) whereas aluffi makes it explicit (the universal property in C_{f, g}) and I was concerned I couldn't find anything about C_{f, g} online. thanks a bunch! :)

[20:41:13] <twJizhan> Can you start with studying mathematics that's below PhD level and end up with working on mathematics that is equivalent to PhD level???
[20:44:35] <Z-module> sure
[20:44:45] <Z-module> most mathematicians do that
[20:44:47] <thecommieduck> how do you think phd students get there
[20:46:25] <tolarz> some people commit the fallacy to think that most good people have always been good
[20:46:37] <tolarz> or they overestimate the importance of "talent"
[20:47:46] <twJizhan> I know I can somehow easily start with studying math and end up with falling asleep for quite a while @@
[20:47:54] *** Joins: quartz (~quartz@user/quartz)
[20:48:38] <thecommieduck> you do realise it takes phd students something like 3-4 years of fulltime study and then probably a couple of years of postgrad, right
[20:48:47] <thecommieduck> it's not something you can knock out in 6 months
[20:49:10] <cherim> 3-4 years of fulltime study and then probably a couple of years of postgrad, and only then sleep

[20:54:02] <mh_le> hey tolarz
[20:54:31] <tolarz> hey mh_le
[20:54:33] <joel135> My gut feeling says that mathematical "talent" is derived from habitual engagement.
[20:54:46] <tolarz> joel135: this is the case for all disciplines, even non-academic ones.
[20:55:01] <joel135> Good to hear you agree then :)
[20:55:22] <mh_le> tolarz: how are things?
[20:55:23] <tolarz> there may be some genetic factors sometimes (e.g., in sports), but largely people succeed primarily because they put in effort.
[20:55:55] <cherim> "Deliberate practice" is the official term
[20:55:57] <tolarz> s/succeed/win at competitive things (because they want to)
[20:56:49] <tolarz> mh_le: i no longer have contact with _her_. and i had to tell my advisors the third time i don't want to do a phd
[20:56:52] <joel135> It doesn't have to be consciously decided and motivated by a long-term perspective, would be my point.
[20:56:58] <tolarz> (they tried convincing me)
[20:57:01] <mh_le> tolarz: ah

[23:13:37] <[-_-]> http://0x0.st/-Yw3.jpg
[23:13:44] <[-_-]> I am talking about this
[23:14:01] <[-_-]> I don't think the logic makes sense here...does it?
[23:14:29] <river> this integral gets you the fourier coefficients
[23:14:33] <river> that's a separate thing
[23:14:57] <[-_-]> yes...but the limit of 0 to x has nothing to do with it?
[23:15:22] <[-_-]> then How on earth am I supposed to understand this during exams?
[23:15:27] <river> the reason they integrate from 0 to pi is because that gives you a result with pi in it
[23:15:45] <river> I mean pi^2
[23:16:04] <[-_-]> you mean 0 to x?
[23:16:13] <river> the goal was to prove some identity about pi^2, so integrating the sawtooth wave from 0 to pi gives you pi^2/2
[23:16:27] <river> so it's a reasonable choice to make
[23:16:32] <cherim> I'd say the goal was to prove somethig about zeta(2)
[23:16:42] <[-_-]> So I have to be reasonable now
[23:16:44] <[-_-]> :(
[23:16:47] <cherim> So they want cos(nx) to be not very trigonometric
[23:16:52] <river> well zeta(2) is the other side of it, using the fourier coefficients
[23:17:14] <river> oh I see what you mean, that's a really great point
[23:17:23] <river> using 0 to pi makes the trig functions disappear
[23:17:37] <cherim> I understand, I just mean "stop at pi to get pi^2" is not very persuasive :)
