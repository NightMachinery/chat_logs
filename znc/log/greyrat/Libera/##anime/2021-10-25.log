[04:01:45] <sentionics> amigojapan: cool, what kind of project is it and what are you coding it in (language, framework, etc)?
[04:02:35] <amigojapan> sentionics: it is for better classifying anime, plain JavaScript and PHP
[04:03:26] <amigojapan> And mysql
[04:04:24] <sentionics> amigojapan: Sounds like a nice project. I know some really prefer vanilla JS. I personally still use JQuery a bit, but am actually shifting towards trying out a reactive library.
[04:04:40] <sentionics> Front-end isn't exactly my favourite area to code in.
[04:05:23] <amigojapan> sentionics: I may use some jQuery at times
[04:05:42] <sentionics> amigojapan: I recently went through a youtube tutorial on using Svelte JS, which is pretty nice looking so far. I'm planning to use it as part of writing VS Code extensions.
[04:06:02] <amigojapan> Ok
[04:08:10] <sentionics> The reactive variables/statements is quite nice. I'm a bit of a greenhorn when it comes to these reactive libraries/frameworks, tbh, but I'm definitely liking the component and composition approach.
[04:10:11] <sentionics> Some people use Storybook to keep track of their reusable components that they intend to use across multiple projects. Looks neat, but also seems a bit of an investment of effort for components that one may or may not ever actually reuse.
[04:11:34] <sentionics> (maybe just having the discipline to always collect and document your reusable stuff is more important than how much of it gets reused, I guess)

[07:52:17] <amigojapan> MootPoot: this should work simillar to political compass but for classifying anime
[07:53:21] <amigojapan> MootPoot: those are the questions that will be asked
[07:57:00] <sentionics> amigojapan: Interesting. Also, sounds like quite the undertaking as well (just to compile the data), as there are tons of anime to go through to make these calls on.

[07:59:27] <amigojapan> sentionics: tomako does not understand "target audience age" no matter how hard i  try to explain
[07:59:47] <sentionics> ahhh, I see. That makes sense. I imagine you'll use ReCaptcha v3 or something to curb the bots/spam submissions on the anime entries that users supply.
[08:00:13] <amigojapan> sentionics: that is a good idea
[08:00:39] <amigojapan> sentionics: tho recaptcha i think is a bit too strict, I have trouble filling it out on mobile
[08:00:51] <amigojapan> sentionics: I think I will use some other captcha
[08:01:22] <sentionics> "Age group the anime is intended for by the show's developers/publisher. Other age groups may also enjoy, but they are not the ones the show is designed for."
[08:02:01] <sentionics> amigojapan: v3 is invisible, unless you're behind a vpn.
[08:02:09] <amigojapan> yeah sentionics , I have tried to say that, but she just does not get it... I will need to ask another Japanese person
[08:02:28] <sentionics> Well, also not having a google account signed in increases the chances it will pop up a challenge as well.
[08:02:42] <amigojapan> ah ok sentionics , then I will give it a try
[08:03:10] <sentionics> amigojapan: alternate solution is to try using Askimet's service.
[08:03:49] <sentionics> submission -> your application -> Askimet api to pass/fail it -> your application
[08:04:13] <sentionics> can't remember if you can use it free for non-commercial sites.

[08:39:15] <sentionics> amigojapan: Now I use WinSCP, but I've gotten to where I now try to use rsync or LFTP (if SSH isn't available) whenever possible. One off file transfers though, WinSCP is what I fall back on (or the cli sftp client)
[08:39:23] <amigojapan> sentionics: I prefer pushing one file at a time and knowing which one I pushed
[08:40:00] <amigojapan> sentionics: I don't use Windows
[08:40:14] <sentionics> amigojapan: Ah, that's right, winscp is windows only.
[08:40:29] <amigojapan> Yup
[08:41:48] <sentionics> There's also, Nautilus if you're using Gnome apparently. But I'm looking at some really old StackOverflow answers.
[08:42:09] <sentionics> amigojapan: main reason I shy from FileZilla is that the author has done some shady stuff with it from what I read.

[08:43:27] <sentionics> Yeah, probably fine on linux the more I think about it.

[08:43:51] <amigojapan> I see
[08:45:05] <sentionics> We kinda have to get it through the installer. I used it while I was still on Win 7, but since getting on win 10, I just switched to WinSCP and have more and more been trying to step away from manually doing transfers for anything routine (code updates).
[08:45:56] <sentionics> Can probably install it without the installer on windows, tbf. But that's more work, ha ha.

[Backend]: Form handling business logic. Details page data pulling (and processing if it needs to be recalculated rather than pulled from cached results). DB table setup.
[08:54:26] <MootPoot> mercury in products is a strict no-no these days
[08:55:40] <amigojapan> sentionics: my wifest goal is just to make the fornt end
[08:56:08] <amigojapan> MootPoot: in Mexico they still use mercury thermometers
[08:56:29] <amigojapan> MootPoot: when I was a kid, I found a huge bottle of mercury, and used to play with it all the time
[08:56:38] <amigojapan> MootPoot: mercury is really fun
[08:56:38] <sentionics> amigojapan: DB migrations can be good to use for managing changes to your database structure. For PHP, a quick google search shows Phinx at the top. (says v0.11 though, so maybe still in beta, but maybe could be a sufficient and lightweight tool, if you're not using a PHP framework).
[08:57:57] <amigojapan> sentionics: it is possible to dump an entire database to a text file mysql, and load it in another mysql, dont need any tool
[08:58:13] <MootPoot> SQL export
[08:58:13] <sentionics> Always good to have some scaffolding in place after you set up your db schema, so you have data ready to go so you can test your business logic.
[08:58:28] <MootPoot> amigojapan: there should be a export function in the mysql ui
[08:58:57] <MootPoot> exports to a text file - you have to select it to export everything - table structures / schema and the records and the triggers etc
[08:59:17] <amigojapan> MootPoot: that is very easy on the command line
[08:59:34] <MootPoot> does mysql have a command line for remote users?
[08:59:42] <sentionics> amigojapan: I mean, for managing incremental changes. With migrations, you can rollback or redo changes if needed (and won't have tons of backup files just to do the same by hand).
[08:59:45] <amigojapan> yes duh MootPoot 
[08:59:49] <MootPoot> idk - its just 30 seconds on the gui
[09:00:01] <MootPoot> just go to the page, check off your boxes, and export
[09:00:19] <amigojapan> I see sentionics 
[09:00:43] <amigojapan> MootPoot: I never use the gui
[09:01:01] <amigojapan> MootPoot: the command line is very good
[09:01:08] <MootPoot> when I was at uni they just had it pre-setup for us
[09:01:13] <MootPoot> we would still write SQL in text
[09:01:26] <MootPoot> but stuff like config, import/export etc was all gui
[09:01:48] <amigojapan> thats for dummies MootPoot 
[09:02:21] <MootPoot> I guess
[09:02:23] <amigojapan> MootPoot: you need to embrace the command line
[09:02:36] <MootPoot> for the scale of work we were doing using the mysql gui was plenty
[09:02:42] <MootPoot> if we were doing fancy shit sure 
[09:03:13] <sentionics> with CLI, if it feels tedious, it's because you need to delegate what you're doing to a script, or at least an alias or function.
[09:03:25] <MootPoot> just depends on your need
[09:03:36] <sentionics> yes.
[09:03:51] <sentionics> though, there is the issue of dealing with credentials, but... that's another topic.
[09:04:23] <sentionics> even if you encrypt, consider those creds compromised if they are stored or otherwise accessible from your user account, and your device gets stolen.
[09:04:24] <MootPoot> also - they were teaching a bunch of n00b students lol
[09:04:32] <amigojapan> sentionics: anyway, I wont b other with the DB yet, cause I have not set up my RPI to do PHP yet
[09:04:53] <MootPoot> there were students there who needed to be taught how to use a web browser
[09:05:00] <MootPoot> teaching them cli would be ...

[09:06:36] <MootPoot> lol
[09:06:46] <amigojapan> sentionics: not sure yet, I could reinstall my RPI, cause it is too old version ot upgrade
[09:06:46] * MootPoot jerks back in horror
[09:06:53] <sentionics> I still haven't upgraded anything to php 8, largely, b/c my clients' hosts don't even support it yet.
[09:06:53] <MootPoot> ...pee....pee ech pee
[09:06:59] <MootPoot> terrifying
[09:07:12] <MootPoot> I'm not a fan of scripting languages
[09:07:18] <MootPoot> I like my compiled stuff
[09:07:38] <amigojapan> MootPoot: little difference nowdays
[09:07:39] <sentionics> MootPoot: PHP isn't so bad, so long as you honor basic separation of concerns and keep business logic and views separate at the very least.
[09:07:45] <amigojapan> MootPoot: on modern computers
[09:07:49] <MootPoot> ?
[09:07:59] <MootPoot> there is still a massive difference amigo 
[09:08:06] <MootPoot> depends on what you're using it for
[09:08:06] <amigojapan> no MootPoot 
[09:08:16] <amigojapan> MootPoot: and web is even less sensitive
[09:08:44] <amigojapan> MootPoot: .NET is not even really compiled, ti is byte code
[09:09:03] <sentionics> MootPoot: if it doesn't need to be high load/performance, scripting languages are a great choice, imo.

[09:10:06] <MootPoot> python is a joke
[09:10:18] <amigojapan> MootPoot: drag race does nto change that ti does nto make a difference if one is faster than the other
[09:10:29] <MootPoot> but yes sentionics, if its not intensive then it dosen't matter
[09:10:37] <MootPoot> amigojapan: depends on use case
[09:10:49] <sentionics> heck, gaming frameworks often using scripting languages as well. C++ and Lua was popular for a long while (might still be, haven't touched much game programming since college)
[09:11:06] <MootPoot> a 5 user webpage? no it dosent. 300k people enterprise system? yes it does
[09:11:50] <MootPoot> afaik gaming frameworks do use both sentionics 
[09:12:19] <MootPoot> scripting for like basic stuff - movement and object / level prep, but the intensive stuff is still compiled
[09:12:23] <MootPoot> as I understand it
[09:13:08] <amigojapan> MootPoot: c# is fake-compiled, its nto really a plain runnable binary
[09:13:08] <sentionics> Fair enough. Of course, there's different strategies at play here too. With a scripting language, you can often get to an MVP and get something to market a lot faster, then just scale up from there on your hosting service as the traffic grows.
[09:13:23] <amigojapan> MootPoot: why not write your web pages in C or rust?
[09:13:36] <MootPoot> amigojapan: when did I say I'm only comparing it with C# though?
[09:13:39] <amigojapan> MootPoot: they will be faster
[09:13:43] <MootPoot> why do you keep on bringing up C#
[09:13:46] <sentionics> But if you know you'll have heavy traffic to begin with, something like Elixir/Phoenix might be a better choice.
[09:13:54] <amigojapan> MootPoot: you said you se it
[09:14:17] <MootPoot> yes, but we're talking about compiled vs scripting, not C# vs all scripting languages
[09:14:21] <MootPoot> I use php as well 
[09:14:22] <MootPoot> lol
[09:15:16] <MootPoot> Quick google says Unreal engine is still using C++
[09:15:36] <amigojapan> sentionics: I could also use nodejs instead of PHP< still have not made up my mind, I like them both
[09:15:48] * MootPoot hisses at nodejs
[09:15:52] <amigojapan> sentionics: but I have more experience with PHP
[09:16:16] <MootPoot> nodejs is a pain
[09:16:27] <MootPoot> I hate having random node packages change and break my shit
[09:16:31] <amigojapan> MootPoot: I like it
[09:17:11] <amigojapan> MootPoot: yeah, that happened to me once
[09:17:21] <MootPoot> also the file sizes are...
[09:17:36] <MootPoot> idk, I dont mind if stuff is big and has a reason for it
[09:17:53] <MootPoot> but my node projects are like = 200kb project and 4gb of node modules
[09:18:07] <MootPoot> mendoksai
[09:18:13] <sentionics> amigojapan: I'm still learning the basics of working with nodejs. Getting there though. Takes a lot of getting used to, with the heavy use of async calls. The await syntax is a huge improvement of having to do Promises.all() or whatever.
[09:18:47] <amigojapan> I see sentionics 
[09:18:59] <MootPoot> =>
[09:19:03] * MootPoot dies
[09:19:11] <sentionics> I think await rolled out with ES7 or ES8 if I'm not mistaken. I'd have to look at EcmaScript's version history again.
[09:19:18] <amigojapan> I like that you program your own web server in nodejs
[09:19:42] <MootPoot> I forgot what it was called
[09:19:57] <MootPoot> there was a specific node/js or some package
[09:20:03] <MootPoot> for writing your own API
[09:20:23] <sentionics> MootPoot: ah, yeah, that's the thing about nodejs, is its dependency hell, and that's why I've generally avoided it in the past.
[09:20:31] <MootPoot> ah yeah - Express.JS
[09:21:10] <MootPoot> I mean PHP has its dependancies as well , same with .NET
[09:21:12] <sentionics> that infamous case of someone taking down their super commonly used library, and suddenly shitloads of projects couldn't build anymore b/c they had that project as a dependency.
[09:21:23] <MootPoot> but they've been historically been much easier to manage for me 
[09:21:50] <MootPoot> in my experience at least

[09:25:07] <sentionics> Lesson I learned from that was, don't reinvent MVC. Just use another framework.
[09:25:23] <sentionics> What unnecessary effort that was.
[09:25:47] <MootPoot> I didn't really "get" MVC for the longest time

[10:36:59] <ImoutoBot> [title] anime_typification_ranking_questions.txt · GitHub
[10:37:06] <tsukkin> deathnote has pretty minimal gore and sexuality but is also a story who follows a pretty immoral character in my opinion
[10:38:12] <snake> amigojapan, in eromanga sensei, the boy is writing lewd stories and having his little sister draw illustrations for it, but he also doesn't ever cross the boundary if you know what i mean
[10:38:16] <snake> maybe its 50% moral
[10:38:23] <amigojapan> tsukkin: even having blood and some nudity reduce the scale of morality a bit
[10:38:30] <tsukkin> amigojapan this would leave something like mushoku tensei as like 80 % hentai ?
[10:38:55] <snake> so the MC is a gentleman mostly
[10:39:06] <amigojapan> snake: nudity has a weight in my chart
[10:39:26] <snake> amigojapan, i dont think there's any nudity in this particular anime
[10:39:30] <tsukkin> kind of feels like you should have a weight for incest and lolicon too ?
[10:39:31] <amigojapan> tsukkin: 20% moral, maybe?
[10:39:36] <snake> have you seen it? i know it was kind of mainstream
[10:39:50] <amigojapan> ok tsukkin , that is good feedback, let me add that

[10:40:35] <tsukkin> mieruko - chan would mess with your tragedy / comedy scale as well
[10:40:51] <tsukkin> horror comedy is a genre of its own that would automatically break that 
[10:41:10] <snake> tsukkin, it's still a work in progress
[10:41:12] <amigojapan> tsukkin: that is fine, the math woudl take care of that
[10:41:22] <snake> amigojapan, using complex numbers?
[10:42:04] <amigojapan> snake: some things add to the weight some things substract from the weight, horror will take  away a bit and comedy will add quite a bit

[10:44:12] <amigojapan> tsukkin: no, web scraping is still unreliable anyway, and also kind of boring

[10:44:40] <snake> just cause some company offers to fix your problem (not being able to cook) doesn't mean it will
[10:44:43] <snake> but they will take your money
[10:45:00] <snake> same thing with the 3d printer in a way
[10:45:11] <MootPoot> well I just wanted to use it to get to try a bunch of things

[10:45:48] <snake> you underestimate the power of subliminal messaging
[10:46:08] <amigojapan> tsukkin: the weights I added are a bit bias , cause I just decided on them arbitrarily
[10:46:21] <MootPoot> I did the math with the coupon and it worked out in m favour - so I was about to do it
[10:46:27] <MootPoot> it was 35 dollars for 6 meals
[10:46:31] <snake> not only will they help you get better at cooking, but they'll also make your family happy, and get you laid
[10:46:48] <MootPoot> it switched back to the normal price of 80 bucks
[10:46:56] <MootPoot> which is way too much - pass
[10:47:10] <snake> o didju try just entering the coupon again
[10:47:16] <snake> or maybe you misread it
[10:47:26] <MootPoot> yeah - it enters fine in the welcome screen

[13:44:39] <DunceCotus> it doesn't sound too dissimilar to KFC in japan, though might be more expensive there due to the demand?

[17:07:36] <amigojapan> Looks like a nice cartoon DunceCotus but it is after I was a kid
[17:08:52] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: yeah from 1996
[17:09:23] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: I was 18
[17:09:57] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: its still airing :| 
[17:10:02] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: already I was into japanination
[17:10:05] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: 25 seasons
[17:10:15] <DunceCotus> I haven't watched it for decades
[17:10:21] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: I see
[17:10:25] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: it looks wholesome
[17:10:37] <DunceCotus> well its meant to be early education
[17:10:45] <DunceCotus> in televisual form
[17:10:46] <amigojapan> I see
[17:11:40] <DunceCotus> for kids of all ages
[17:11:53] <DunceCotus> "It is the longest-running children's animated series in the U.S., and the second longest-running animated series in the U.S., behind Fox's The Simpsons."
[17:12:06] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: I had to drive 2 hours to get VHS tapes of anime, you kids have it easy
[17:12:44] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: I see
[17:13:02] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: well at least you had the patience back then
[17:13:25] <amigojapan> Yeah
[17:13:40] <DunceCotus> these days 2 hours is very slow without internet
[17:13:50] <DunceCotus> with internet its very fast
[17:14:02] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: the cheapest option was to get VHS tapes with random anime on them
[17:14:09] <DunceCotus> time has certainly become a lot more variable, experientially
[17:14:37] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: I really enjoyed driving tho
[17:14:52] <DunceCotus> kripke's last VHS tape
[17:14:53] <amigojapan> So I was not bored
[17:15:12] <DunceCotus> you enjoyed driving?
[17:15:19] <DunceCotus> you WOT mate
[17:15:53] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: VHS was such a crap format now I think on it
[17:16:11] <DunceCotus> I can't believe we rented that shit xD
[17:16:13] <ButterNoodle> better than broadcast tv
[17:16:24] <DunceCotus> well that's not saying much
[17:16:32] <ButterNoodle> thats all we had
[17:16:35] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: it was better than the first DVDs cause it could record
[17:16:50] <ButterNoodle> amigojapan: VCDs
[17:16:57] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: yeah but by doing so you wear out the tape for the next person
[17:16:58] <ButterNoodle> 2 disks to make a movie
[17:17:11] <ButterNoodle> not necessarily DunceCotus
[17:17:12] <amigojapan> Right ButterNoodle but I had not heard of them back then
[17:17:18] <DunceCotus> betamax
[17:17:27] <ButterNoodle> I was making VCD rips in 98
[17:17:40] <ButterNoodle> DunceCotus: well they fucked the dog and didnt market better
[17:17:50] <ButterNoodle> and it was only marginally better than vhs
[17:17:52] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: we wood reuse the tape hundreds of times
[17:18:23] <DunceCotus> ButterNoodle: there's a worldline out there who experienced a betamax 80s and 90s
[17:18:35] <ButterNoodle> a few extra lines of resolution @ 640/480 compared to 1080P is like comparing real video to mp4s.
[17:18:37] <DunceCotus> in that worldline we already have flying cars
[17:18:49] <ButterNoodle> DunceCotus: yea I a beta deck
[17:18:54] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: vcd is just something I found out from Technomoan for me
[17:19:12] <MootPoot> 4k or nothing
[17:19:21] <DunceCotus> VCD was extremely niche in my country
[17:19:37] <ButterNoodle> when I use to dick with video editing in the 90s we were using beta decks
[17:19:37] <MootPoot> I had a video cassette player 
[17:19:42] <ButterNoodle> nice
[17:19:42] <DunceCotus> apparently the VCDs rivalled early dvd
[17:19:48] <ButterNoodle> it did
[17:19:59] <MootPoot> I probably remember it looking a lot better then it was 
[17:20:20] <ButterNoodle> dvd won bc of better tech, even though it was more expensive
[17:20:30] <ButterNoodle> $300 for a sony dvd player..
[17:20:31] <MootPoot> Lazeedisk
[17:20:32] <amigojapan> MootPoot: we watched Hollywood blockbusters in them
[17:20:41] <ButterNoodle> MootPoot: lazer dicks
[17:20:52] <ButterNoodle> that tech was too early.. $$$
[17:20:59] <MootPoot> Dee Vee Dee Arr
[17:21:09] <DunceCotus> but nothing beats blu-rag
[17:21:16] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: PS2 was my first DVD player. I still have it
[17:21:22] <MootPoot> I've never owned a desktop Blucum reader/writer
[17:21:30] <MootPoot> amigojapan: same 
[17:21:35] <MootPoot> Although I sold mine 
[17:21:42] <DunceCotus> bluray is a stupid name
[17:21:46] <DunceCotus> HDDVD made sense
[17:21:49] <DunceCotus> there was continuity
[17:21:58] <DunceCotus> there's another worldline there too
[17:22:08] <ButterNoodle> u recently watch S;G ?
[17:22:17] <DunceCotus> I have lived S;G
[17:22:30] <ButterNoodle> can u send a dmail back to me to buy some more btc?

[17:22:47] <DunceCotus> ButterNoodle: no I can only send 4 years back
[17:23:13] <DunceCotus> and if you buy more btc it may mean another 2 terms of Trump
[17:24:07] <ButterNoodle> doesnt matter.. have btc

[17:30:22] <DunceCotus> that's a crap definition
[17:30:35] <DunceCotus> its not just for babies, or small ones anyway
[17:30:38] <amigojapan> Yeah?
[17:30:46] <amigojapan> I see

[18:12:27] <Cryowolf> DunceCotus, a large part of the problem with his dog is that it doesn't see him as Alpha and it's a female dog that's still in its "puppy" years (like 2.5 years old) and thinking it has to take on the alpha role makes it stressed out, makes it bark at everything etc. Except when I'm there and mostly looks at me on how to react to most things. It should be doing this with him
[18:13:22] <Cryowolf> Ive also taught it not to greet me with jumping and biting :P
[18:13:46] <DunceCotus> Cryowolf: basically the dog has gone insane
[18:14:07] <Cryowolf> not really, it has a bad owner and this could easily be solved by getting the right owner
[18:14:38] <DunceCotus> im not so sure
[18:15:13] <DunceCotus> Cryowolf: its odd that it reacts so different to you
[18:15:29] <DunceCotus> perhaps you give off peaceful vibes and dog appreciates that
[18:16:03] <Cryowolf> no its cause of how ive behaved towards it. Very strict, I don't tolerate it misbehaving and I reinforce good behavior with petting etc
[18:17:06] <Cryowolf> nothing strange about a dog behaving differently to those it considers ranked higher in the pack

[21:35:18] <TsundereNoises> this is how we know Jigsy isn't american
[21:35:27] <Jigsy> Since they're only going to edit the video to their viewpoint.
