[09:58:29] <TelegramBridge[m> Oh
[09:58:55] <AryaBackup[m]> messaging as channel isnt supported by the bridge yet
[09:58:59] <AryaBackup[m]> so it looks like that
[09:59:11] <AryaBackup[m]> so i would suggest noone use the message as channel feature
[09:59:16] <TelegramBridge[m> I see
[09:59:26] <TelegramBridge[m> BTW, I'm using a Channel

[10:01:16] <TelegramBridge[m> @ambeux is me
[10:01:47] <TelegramBridge[m> BTW, I should open Telegram Web again.

[10:14:29] <AryaBackup[m]> you were messaging as a channel
[10:14:32] <AryaBackup[m]> and are still doing so
[10:15:07] <pystardust> testuser[m]: open element web instead :D or https://web.libera.chat/

[10:17:35] <TelegramBridge[m> lol
[10:17:48] <NeoVoid[m]> whats happening
[10:18:06] <NeoVoid[m]> why my msgs looks bold

[10:26:53] <NeoVoid[m]1> I am gonna listen to pystar and delete my telegram. 
[10:26:53] <NeoVoid[m]1> but wait i am the freaking owner of telegram side. 
[10:30:01] <AryaBackup[m]> we need admins for telegram

[10:37:58] <testuser[m]> Why
[10:38:02] <NeoVoid[m]> I am having mental battle on this trying to understand his point of view. but couldnt really get it. May be I am complete FOSS shenanigans afterall.
[10:38:31] <testuser[m]> Are u worried about server side being closed?
[10:39:04] <NeoVoid[m]1> yes
[10:39:27] <testuser[m]> Even matrix.org could be running a patched synapse with malicious code and you'd never know
[10:40:24] <NeoVoid[m]1> Thats why no one on their right mind and follows the foss philosophy are against using telegram
[10:41:35] <NeoVoid[m]1> s/Thats why no one on their right mind and follows the foss philosophy are against using telegram/Thats why no one on their right mind who agrees with the foss philosophy cant trust telegram/
[10:41:36] <testuser[m]> The stuff that actually matters is the encryption which can't be compromised by a malicious server, if it can, then the protocol is shit
[10:41:39] <AryaBackup[m]> hostyour own matrix
[10:42:06] <NeoVoid[m]1> again link on your title
[10:42:29] <NeoVoid[m]> is bridge dead
[10:42:32] <testuser[m]> What are they going to do with a proprietary server though? With proprietary clients like shitcord they can inject telemetry and shit
[10:42:44] <testuser[m]> NeoVoid[m]: no
[10:43:57] <NeoVoid[m]1> testuser[m]: idk but still their arent using e2ee but their custom encryption which highly the topic of debate
[10:44:21] <testuser[m]> vro that's verifiable in the client source code
[10:44:31] <testuser[m]> If encryption is handled on server side then it's broken
[10:45:15] <testuser[m]> * is handled completely on server
[10:45:21] <NeoVoid[m]1> <AryaBackup[m]> "we need admins for telegram..." <- you are one too
[10:45:35] <AryaBackup[m]> not like i have touched my telegram in a long time
[10:45:39] <NeoVoid[m]1> testuser[m]: idontget it
[10:46:11] <AryaBackup[m]> usually messages are encrypted in client sent to server and server sends it to the receiver  
[10:46:38] <NeoVoid[m]1> being telegram group owner is cursed especially when you cant trust the platform fully itseld
[10:46:45] <NeoVoid[m]1> s/itseld/itself. /
[10:46:52] <AryaBackup[m]> server side means i think the unencrypted message is sent to server encrypted just with https its encrypted in server and sent to the reciever 
[10:47:00] <AryaBackup[m]> how active is the old group
[10:47:15] <NeoVoid[m]1> very less
[10:47:55] <NeoVoid[m]1> so encryption happens in server? 
[10:48:16] <AryaBackup[m]> i am myself not sure lol
[10:48:25] <AryaBackup[m]> we need new admins
[10:48:32] <AryaBackup[m]> who are actually active on telegram
[10:49:01] <NeoVoid[m]1> telegram is becoming cringier day by day with all of its bloated fancy features
[10:49:47] <NeoVoid[m]1> its becoming new discord
[10:50:00] <relejek[m]> Neo Void:  just choose another admin for TG group if you wish to switch to irc or matrix
[10:50:00] <testuser[m]> Fork the client vro
[10:50:40] <AryaBackup[m]> are there any viable admins 
[10:51:29] <NeoVoid[m]1> relejek[m]: we already tons of admins
[10:51:29] <NeoVoid[m]1> same case with old groups
[10:51:29] <NeoVoid[m]1> but no one cares to do the job seriously because probably busy

[11:03:28] <AryaBackup[m]> so performance issues ...
[11:07:11] <relejek[m]> overused in the sense that it has to handle alot of other matrix-tg connections? 
[11:08:40] <AryaBackup[m]> yes
[11:09:44] <NeoVoid[m]> relejek[m]: hmm may be
[11:09:48] <relejek[m]> yet it is working pretty smoothly  for us. so why fix what is not broken?
[11:11:30] <AryaBackup[m]> messages arent going over to telegram side i think

[11:30:36] <NeoVoid[m]1> relejek[m]: i always wanted to see such post
[11:30:44] <NeoVoid[m]1> but never mind
[11:31:17] <NeoVoid[m]1> maybe i'll join matrix forum for opsec
[11:34:06] <relejek[m]> yeah. we have all sorts of people here who have diffrent level of opsec understanding in gnulinux group. just sharing a random code to 'test for vuln' on your system is a bad practice.
[11:35:12] <relejek[m]> no where on that article it says as a warning 'to not run it on your main system' or 'only run it in a closed testing system'

[14:23:08] <ramram[m]> hey guys what do you think of nft's
[14:23:15] <testuser[m]> poty
[14:24:06] <relejek[m]> ramram[m]: good tech. yet it need to get more mature outside of speculation market.
[14:25:44] <gtlsgamr> nfts are fads
[14:26:03] <gtlsgamr> smart contracts already exist why make nfts a thing?
[14:43:21] <TelegramBridge[m> <ramram[m]> "hey guys what do you think of..." <- Utter ridiculousness
[14:43:48] <Abhi[m]> <ramram[m]> "hey guys what do you think of..." <- People don’t understand it and most ntfs are scam
[14:44:48] <ramram[m]> TelegramBridge[m: explain will this fall or not

[15:01:02] <ramram[m]> wth is this?
[15:01:24] <hemish> Fluffy chat works better for me both on linux and android, compared to element. But j use gomuks on laptop. And don't use matrix in android, just revolution irc. Ffluffychat worked all great except one feature that is present in element: picking up from unread messages. Fluffy chat just scrolls down to most recent message
[15:01:24] <hemish> One praise about fluffy chat: it somehow put itself automatically int trusted devices, whereas in my case sometimes even element shows unverified. Though we can manually make them verified
[15:02:28] <hemish> Though it has sometimes issues with freedesktop.org secret service. I don't use gnome keyring. Instead I now setup keepassx. Just for secret service and not for passwords
[15:04:12] <hemish> *keepassxc
[15:06:34] <AryaBackup[m]> <ramram[m]> "paste.png" <- WTF
[15:06:43] <AryaBackup[m]> Neo Void and telegram admins
