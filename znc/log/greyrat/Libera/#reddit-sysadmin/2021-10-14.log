[00:11:44] <Arlion> is aws up or down? AWS DOESN'T EVEN KNOW.
[00:11:52] <Arlion> its 100% uptime if you never report the downtime.
[00:18:01] <spiderman> our company guarantees uptime to 9 nine's

[02:57:25] <Hunterkll> i missed this statement
[02:57:26] <Hunterkll> During the outage, the full Internet routing table was being announced in the OVHcloud IGP. The massive influx of routing information on the IGP led some routers to miss behave : OSPF table got full, overloading RAM and CPU. The impact was the IPv4 routing only and all IPv6 traffic were accessible.
[02:57:26] <sd> 03<H​urdyGurdyBurdy> he got mad that docker kept crashing my vm
[02:57:38] <Hunterkll> they overrouted the routing and filled the routes

[02:57:46] <sd> 03<H​urdyGurdyBurdy> oof
[02:58:16] <Hunterkll> and the reason IPv6 kept working is that in most hardware/devices, those route tables are in specific dedicated memory and separate under separate processes

[07:39:08] <csws> Hunterkll, we have holds on every mailbox :shrug:
[07:39:10] <Hunterkll> no one's actually written a fuse module or similar to mount an exchange mailbox as a local filesystem
[07:39:14] <Hunterkll> csws: that's just crazy talk
[07:39:18] <csws> lol
[07:39:26] <csws> I wish we'd move to lit hold though
[07:39:27] <DrZak> csws: in number of countries you cant
[07:39:29] <csws> we're still on in place holds
[07:39:38] <Hunterkll> we got retention policies *because* we want shit to be deleted unless there's a specific reason why
[07:39:39] <Hunterkll> lol
[07:39:48] <DrZak> btw holds
[07:39:52] <DrZak> thats fun thing too
[07:39:52] <csws> yeah well we have the 7 year hold requirement
[07:40:05] <Hunterkll> sure, but not for everything
[07:40:07] <csws> previous place did unlimited holds
[07:40:24] <DrZak> legaly in germany you need to NOT retain data from users 'private' folder/location
[07:40:24] <Hunterkll> SOX only does it for things like financial data, etc..... your IT support guy doesn't need that hold :P
[07:40:32] <DrZak> so, it is a bit complicated
[07:41:01] <Hunterkll> but i mean if you're not paying for the storage i suppose .... yolo 
[07:41:02] <sd> 02<r​yalln> that sounds nice to not store shit
[07:41:23] <sd> 02<r​yalln> try some of my governemnt contracts. Depending on the personal data. staff cannot email/teams/message that to someone
[07:41:44] <DrZak> yea
[07:41:49] <Hunterkll> the whole point of retention policies, documented ones that are lawfully compliant, to purge shit, is so when someone sues the shit out of you discovery may or may not succeed because "oops, sox retention policy deleted that like 2 years and 90 days ago"
[07:41:55] <Hunterkll> and you're in the clear
[07:42:01] <sd> 02<r​yalln> Yep
[07:42:01] <Hunterkll> unless some dumbass has a local archive on his laptop 
[07:42:06] <Hunterkll> we no longer even allow local archiving
[07:42:09] <Hunterkll> online archive only, etc 
[07:42:20] <csws> hold everything!
[07:42:23] <DrZak> its all connected with that idiot apple approach
[07:42:26] <sd> 02<r​yalln> I remember when I worked for iinet. because the CEO at the time MM, didnt say or store anything in his emails about people torenting and said fuck all he shafted some of there complaints
[07:42:46] <DrZak> which makes dumbass users too stupid to create any information management customs
[07:43:04] <Hunterkll> heh
[07:43:14] <DrZak> so they go into business
[07:43:20] <Hunterkll> when i started here in 2014 we had 10mb mailboxes (or was it 100?) with 1gb by super major exception policy only
[07:43:22] <Hunterkll> on lotus notes
[07:43:22] <DrZak> and sharepoint sites have then no strucuture
[07:43:37] <DrZak> poor loltus
[07:43:46] <DrZak> this is also a lotus to o365 migration
[07:43:55] <Hunterkll> we still use notes, but we use notes for what it's meant for 
[07:43:57] <Hunterkll> LOB app platform 
[07:44:00] <Hunterkll> not an email client
[07:44:36] <DrZak> yea, this happens often, along with profound misunderstanding of shared service
[07:44:59] <DrZak> yea, we go to office 365 from out lotus, but we want it too look and work like our lotus
[07:45:24] <Hunterkll> that... ain't gonna happen
[07:45:30] <xe0n> LOL
[07:45:38] <DrZak> these particular fellows decided the right way around this is to create a ton of outlook add-ins
[07:45:38] <Hunterkll> unless HCL added O365 email support to notes
[07:45:39] <Hunterkll> :D
[07:45:59] <DrZak> so, it takes about 3-5 minutes to load outlook
[07:46:01] <Hunterkll> DrZak: i got some cyanide creamer for your coffee if you want
[07:46:14] <DrZak> noo noo, i migrate them off and im done
[07:46:20] <DrZak> the support will need that though
[07:46:32] <Hunterkll> no no i meant like
[07:46:36] <Hunterkll> swap out the office creamer
[07:46:40] <Hunterkll> for the rank and file employees
[07:46:55] <Hunterkll> solve many problems with one solution
[07:47:24] <DrZak> oh yea, another fun thing is - We pay A LOT OF MONEY! to migrate off premise, so we are not holding any .ost files on storage!!!! only online mode - for 13k users with 2gbps internet link (shared by ton of SAP cloud shit and .. everything pretty much)
[07:47:31] <DrZak> its just loads of fun
[07:48:02] <Hunterkll> yea.... we do actually use cached mode but lol
[07:48:10] <Hunterkll> i'd throw a major fit for online only 
[07:48:20] <Hunterkll> htf am i supposed to review shit in an airplane 
[07:48:35] <Hunterkll> when half of them have broken or no wifi if it even has wifi at all
[07:48:47] <Hunterkll> hol up lemme put my starlink dish in the window
[07:49:31] <Hunterkll> DrZak: still, even if you were using cached, you're still adding a lot more strain to that link anyway since it'll try online retreival/search first 
[07:49:31] <xe0n> ha enjoy degraded performance.
[07:49:39] <Hunterkll> oh well
[07:49:43] <xe0n> exchange online you want cache mode...investigate how to manage it.

[07:53:17] <sd> 02<r​yalln> half is the OS, the rest if apps. then if you take a picture it stops working
[07:53:19] <Hunterkll> cap the OST to 1GB 
[07:53:41] <Hunterkll> ofc, outlook 2013 and up auto-cap the OST on small drives anyway....
[07:54:25] <DrZak> um, its citrix, so osts are offloaded to a share
[07:54:44] <Hunterkll> i was talking about the laptop/desktop scenario
[07:54:47] <DrZak>  combined with morons who end up with 50gb of data -> a looot of disk space
[07:54:48] <Hunterkll> so you're saying they're pure VDI?
[07:54:48] <Hunterkll> lol
[07:54:50] <DrZak> :)
[07:54:55] <DrZak> Hunterkll: almost
[07:54:56] <Hunterkll> yea so GPO cap the OST size...... 
[07:55:08] <xe0n> something something you should be gpo'ing the office suite anyway
[07:55:10] <Hunterkll> then you have 13k * 2GB = max usage 
[07:55:12] <DrZak> 90% are working only with citrix using the laptops as terminals
[07:55:20] <Hunterkll> god
[07:55:22] <Hunterkll> i wish we could do that
[07:55:29] <Hunterkll> so does security.... lol!
[07:55:29] <DrZak> yea, i suggested them 3months of cache
[07:55:35] <DrZak> no no, expensive
[07:55:44] <Hunterkll> yea cap it by size, not X days 
[07:56:01] <Hunterkll> makes it far easier to do numbers on what you need storage wise and make a better case 
[07:56:01] <DrZak> you cant
[07:56:06] <Hunterkll> yes.... you can

[08:07:55] <LordOfThePings> That's just silly.

[08:08:05] <xe0n> LOL
[08:08:06] <LordOfThePings> Oracle however, on the other hand, has free stuff
[08:08:11] <xe0n> good one
[08:08:39] <Hunterkll> yea but oracle's slices are tiny as fuck tho
[08:08:47] <Hunterkll> and AWS/Azure you can just keep churning out new email addresses
[08:09:01] <Hunterkll> the 2 free 1GB ram VMs you get are pretty much linux only and 1/8th of a  CPU core
[08:09:23] <LordOfThePings> One Ping to rule them all. One Ping to find them. One Ping to bring them all... and in the network bind them
[08:09:25] <Hunterkll> AWS/Azure 1 year of much better stuff 
[08:09:32] <Hunterkll> but they do want you to eventually pay and/or not hog address space
[08:09:46] <Hunterkll> oracle is doing it because, well, who the fuck wants to use oracle cloud?
[08:09:56] <LordOfThePings> LOL
[08:10:08] <Hunterkll> i use it for an irc bot literally named 'boobs'

[08:11:50] <Hunterkll> but their other limits are good for exploring the tech, but not really useful to 'do' anything
[08:12:01] <Hunterkll> AWS/Azure's free tier limits you can actually get away with doing useful non-training stuff on

[08:18:16] <EnchanterTim> So you can just make new AWS accounts and use a server free for a year and keep doing it over and over?
[08:18:30] <EnchanterTim> Kind of have to redo servers every year, that's the only downside I think
[08:18:52] <pitastrudl> dont you need to bind a credit card every time
[08:19:04] <EnchanterTim> Yeah I thought they did some kind of verification
[08:19:26] <Hunterkll> virtual card numbers from your bank or whatever
[08:19:44] <Hunterkll> lotsa places offer that kinda thing (temp made on the spot numbers)
[08:19:57] <EnchanterTim> They verify
[08:20:16] <Hunterkll> yes.... and you give it a $2 limit.... boom done.....
[08:20:17] <EnchanterTim> The days of CC generators and extraploratos was done circia 1996/1997
[08:20:29] <EnchanterTim> Come 98 almost everyone was doing instant verification.

[08:20:41] <Hunterkll> .......
[08:20:45] <Hunterkll> "from your bank or whatever"

[08:28:00] <Hunterkll> huh guess not, oh well, just for business travel stuff
[08:28:07] <Hunterkll> either way, a lot of my cards do have it, so it's whatever

[10:15:57] <sd> 02<S​ir Sceptalot> Ok, so it's configurable for on-prem (which we don't have) and max 90 days for exchange online.

[10:18:27] <JollyRgrs> Oliber: don't diss rap now. there's a lot of good out there... just a lot of crap as well (like any other genre)
[10:18:30] <xe0n> Sir Sceptalot....question answered
[10:18:33] <xe0n> imagine if you googled it yourself?
[10:18:53] <Oliber> sir, i am just spittin facts
[10:19:10] <xe0n> rhymes*
[10:19:49] <JollyRgrs> xe0n: but how can one ask basic questions in IRC if they already googled and found the answers?
[10:19:57] <JollyRgrs> what would I talk about in here if I googled?
[10:20:01] <JollyRgrs> OH THE HUMANITY!
[10:20:09] <xe0n> interesting stuff :)
[10:20:11] <xe0n> like rap!
[10:20:12] <xe0n> duh
[10:20:14] <sd> 02<S​ir Sceptalot> I did google it myself, and I found no way to go beyond 90 days.
[10:20:14] <sd> 02<S​ir Sceptalot> The thing is though: I know that I'm an idiot, so I might be overlooking something very basic
[10:20:16] <xe0n> sheeeshhh
[10:20:28] <JollyRgrs> lol xe0n 
[10:20:33] <xe0n> :D
[10:21:13] <JollyRgrs> so what you really wanted to ask us was "hey, what i read says exchange online you can't configure logs past 90 days, anyone know if there's a workaround or if that is it?"
[10:21:21] <xe0n> ++
[10:21:22] <JollyRgrs> it makes it look like you googled before asking the question
[10:22:24] <sd> 02<S​ir Sceptalot> I did mention the 90 days in my original question.
[10:22:24] <sd> 02<S​ir Sceptalot> "With O365, is it possible to see if an outgoing message was delivered to the recipient when it's more than 90 days ago?"
[10:22:42] <JollyRgrs> yes, you did mention it... but differently
[10:22:54] <JollyRgrs> look, we're not here to poke fun at you. we're trying to help you
[10:22:59] <sd> 02<S​ir Sceptalot> The 90 days could have been a good guess I suppose
[10:23:39] <sd> 02<S​ir Sceptalot> I know, and you did.
[10:23:39] <sd> 02<S​ir Sceptalot> Not sure if I said this already though: thanks
[10:24:11] <JollyRgrs> well, i meant also with how to formulate questions so you look smarter (or to show you did some research)
[10:24:28] <JollyRgrs> people are much more likely to offer help/advise if they see you've tried to google first
[10:24:47] <xe0n> :)
[10:25:00] <JollyRgrs> so many times ppl ask a question and i literally take their question, paste it into google and result 1 is a very clear answer/response which is just what they needed
[10:25:30] <sd> 02<S​ir Sceptalot> I'll try to phrase it more clearly next time. I just tried to get my question very to the point.
[10:26:14] <JollyRgrs> or in your case, if you knew that exchange online has a 90 day limit and no way around it... you'd know that that's that... and if you wanted to find a workaround for future logging, you could ask if there's any workarounds
[10:26:44] <JollyRgrs> but that's the thing... you need to explain the whole thing, or it is just a point in outerspace with no context
[10:26:47] <JollyRgrs> disconnected
[10:27:10] <JollyRgrs> HEEEEEEEEEERE AM I SITTING IN A TIN CAN, FAAAR ABOVE THE WOOOORRRRLD!

[10:28:08] <sd> 02<S​ir Sceptalot> Don't need a workaround, this is the only time it was ever asked for so far back (february). I mostly needed confirmation I wasn't overlooking something.

[10:53:47] <xe0n> nah im good
[10:53:59] <PrincessZoey> That's going to be my next one
[10:54:01] <JollyRgrs> i should order a new laptop... i got a slight bulgie wulgie where the battery is... just slight, been that way 6 mo. or so at least
[10:54:20] <Oliber> why not just a new battery?
[10:54:31] <ender> https://twitter.com/bcrypt/status/1448378297490968577
[10:54:32] <JollyRgrs> but i honestly just don't want to deal with it... and maybe if i'm lucky, we'll move back to dell from HP before i need a new laptop
[10:54:41] <JollyRgrs> Oliber: work laptop, idc
[10:54:47] <xe0n> ++
[10:54:54] <xe0n> i'll wait to see what apple do
[10:54:59] <ender> you don't have support contracts for your laptops?
[10:55:09] <JollyRgrs> why would we?
[10:55:26] <JollyRgrs> i mean... we might... not sure how many years they do
[10:55:29] <ender> what about warranty at least?
[10:55:34] <ender> how old is it?
[10:55:43] <JollyRgrs> but either way, they'd prob ship me a diff laptop and then hold mine to get it fixed under wty and dish out to someone else later on
[10:55:48] <JollyRgrs> like 2 yrs ish
[10:56:15] <JollyRgrs> you don't make the end user wait w/o a laptop while you get the battery fixed, etc. you jsut give them a new device and "Recycle" the old one into your "used" inventory
[10:56:20] <ender> then it should still have warranty - business laptops usually have 3 years
[10:56:38] <JollyRgrs> yeah, at the hospital, we did an extra year to make it 4
[10:57:08] <ender> we just call the service to order a new battery, then swap it when it arrives, and return the old one
[10:57:15] <JollyRgrs> where i'm at now, it used to be each country might have had a diff contract... now we're all under HP... but AFAIK it has been a cluster trying to deal with them
[10:57:22] <JollyRgrs> my batt is internal
[10:57:34] <ender> yeah, about 15 minutes of work
[10:57:35] <JollyRgrs> i doubt our service desk can do that
[10:57:48] <JollyRgrs> replacing a removable battery would be stretching their skills
[10:57:54] <ender> ouch
[10:58:02] <JollyRgrs> and 15 min of work? lol
[10:58:04] <JollyRgrs> you assume a lot
[10:58:12] <JollyRgrs> ever tried to replace a keyboard on a sony laptop for example?
[10:58:22] <JollyRgrs> i had to basically disassemble the entire thing to reach it
[10:58:29] <ender> no, but I replaced batteries in HP Pro and EliteBooks
[10:58:43] <ender> 15 minutes is if you really don't know what you're doing
[10:58:45] <JollyRgrs> some companies put more into engineering for size rather than servicing
[10:59:01] <JollyRgrs> sony was notorious for that
[10:59:32] <JollyRgrs> dell, usually you just push in two notches and the keyboard pops out, unlock the ribbon, then reverse for installing the new one
[10:59:38] <JollyRgrs> maybe 1 screw... maybe
[10:59:47] <ender> remove the bottom (9-15 screws, depending on model), remove the battery (0-3 screws), place new battery, close the cover. They're easily serviceable, unlike consumer models
[11:00:06] <JollyRgrs> yeah, i mean, again, idc
[11:00:10] <PrincessZoey> I took the bottom lid off mikespears's old laptop and the battery just flopped out
[11:00:14] <PrincessZoey> like dick in boxes
[11:00:16] <ender> older EliteBooks had no screws at the bottom, I've no idea why they changed that from G3 onwards
[11:00:18] <PrincessZoey> ... 
[11:00:50] <ender> no ribbons involved at least
[11:01:04] <JollyRgrs> nothing worse than someone breaking the ribbon bracket
[11:01:21] <ender> the battery just sits there and is either latched or screwed in
[11:02:07] <JollyRgrs> tryna think... i don't think we ever tore apart laptops when i worked as a desk tech at the hospital
[11:02:37] <JollyRgrs> we did a RAM upgrade for a lot of them (just before W7 upgrades from XP) but I was already working on SCCM by then
[11:03:20] <ender> i once destroyed the keyboard ribbon bracket on some consumer laptop - and to make it worse, it was something so proprietary you couldn't even get a compatible part anywhere
[11:03:40] <ender> these days i just refuse to work on consumer laptops
[11:03:57] <ender> even swapping HDD to SSD can involve taking the whole thing apart
[11:03:58] <PrincessZoey> I'm getting a new NVME ssd, ram, and a wifi card
[11:04:11] <JollyRgrs> but yeah, with everyone WFH now, you'd have to ship laptop in... have someone get it, replace battery, then ship back... OOOOORRRR... get shipped new laptop, get it running, then ship old one back and don't care what they do with it (refresh it, fix it, send it to someone else as a loaner or to replace an OLDER laptop or something)
[11:04:16] <ender> PrincessZoey: what laptop brand?
[11:04:20] <PrincessZoey> Acer
[11:04:28] <ender> ok, swapping wifi there should work
[11:04:28] <PrincessZoey> acer e5-575g-53vg
[11:04:39] <csws> woah
[11:04:47] <csws> silverlight EOL end of this month?
[11:04:53] <ender> HP, Dell and Lenovo throw a fit if you put in a non-branded wifi card
[11:04:58] <JollyRgrs> it isn't EOL already csws ?
[11:05:02] <JollyRgrs> lol who is still using it?
[11:05:05] <Oliber> i thought silverlight was dead years ago
[11:05:07] <csws> oh "end of support"
[11:05:16] <csws> oh fuck
[11:05:19] <csws> oct 12 2021 lol
[11:05:22] <ender> Oliber: Windows Update on Server 2012 R2 keeps offering it
[11:05:24] <csws> this luser is wrong.. it's already dead
[11:05:36] <JollyRgrs> Oliber: exactly, the last stronghold for me was stupid application website for SCCM that used it
[11:05:38] <Hunterkll> csws: well you weren't wrong
[11:05:40] <Hunterkll> it was this month
[11:05:40] <JollyRgrs> even back then it was a PITA
[11:05:41] <Hunterkll> lol
[11:05:53] <csws> Hunterkll, we've got this shitty app ofc
[11:06:08] <csws> and the owner is trying to get our asses in gear on an upgrade because of that silverlight dependency
[11:06:10] <JollyRgrs> csws: i mean... i really go by "+1 month" for EOL to call it out of compliance :D
[11:06:25] <Oliber> the SfB 2015/6 control panel is still silvershite sadly
[11:06:42] <JollyRgrs> so you're good until the next patches woulda come out (November) when they don't
[11:07:00] <JollyRgrs> Oliber: oh gross... but when is SfB going EOL?
[11:07:08] <Oliber> JollyRgrs: 2023 i think
[11:07:09] <JollyRgrs> i know you can't do online, only on-prem, right?
[11:07:16] <Oliber> correct
[11:07:33] <csws> SCCM admin console has that silverlight appearance
[11:07:40] <csws> is it actually silverlight under the bonnet still?
[11:07:42] <Oliber> oh sorry, it's 2025 for SfB server
[11:08:00] <Hunterkll> https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/answers/questions/305720/silvrlight-eol-october.html
[11:08:49] <Hunterkll> Oliber: but you can also just use powershell instead
[11:08:50] <Hunterkll> lol
[11:08:53] <Hunterkll> good time to learn
[11:08:54] <Hunterkll> :)
[11:09:00] <csws> get-csuser | remove-csuser
[11:09:02] <csws> i'm learnding
[11:09:03] <Hunterkll> JollyRgrs: can't wait to upgrade to SfB 2022 server
[11:09:04] <Hunterkll> lol
[11:09:58] <Oliber> most of our SfB management is done via our account management or inhouse built webapps (pretty much only setting a user to EV and the phone URI), because the control panel is so horrific
[11:10:37] <csws> yeah last place had on prem SFB and we had it tied into MIM
[11:10:40] <Oliber> it has a strange behaviour where sometimes it refuses to load, unless you hold f5 for a bit on the browser, and at somepoint it'll load
[11:10:49] <csws> and then a little button in snow to recreate the user if anything went wrong
[11:11:10] <csws> Oliber, you ever get the issue where a trailing space in the display name woudl cause it to fail to enable a user?
[11:11:12] <csws> that one is lol
[11:11:50] <Oliber> not encountered that, probably because our HR/student data goes through a few different things that sanity check it
[11:12:19] <csws> https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/Lync/en-US/6204d1eb-3587-4c0b-a277-bdceb5c9c5fc/the-property-value-is-invalid-the-value-cant-contain-leading-or-trailing-white-space?forum=exchangesvrgeneral
[11:12:20] <csws> just lol
[11:12:41] <csws> the HR data was usually quality but contractors were inputted via snow and it's all freetext fields :(
[11:13:08] <csws> oh wow that's exchange
[11:13:15] <csws> oh well.. same shit used to happen with SFB
[11:13:46] <Oliber> one day, i hope that our HR will know who works for us; they say we have ~650 staff, but 1100 accounts get created because of contractors/agency staff/volunteers/etc
[11:13:58] <Hunterkll> S4B's pretty good as a telephony system though
[11:14:15] <csws> yeah
[11:14:26] <csws> could be worse
[11:14:27] <Hunterkll> we're actually using S4B for telephony still till something better is figured out i suppose 
[11:14:32] * csws flashbacks to oracle CCA
[11:14:38] <Hunterkll> for teams
[11:14:39] <Hunterkll> :P
[11:14:49] <csws> yeah last joint was like that
[11:14:54] <csws> SFB for telephony, teams for literally everything else
[11:15:04] <Hunterkll> our onprem S4B is our telephony for teams lol (and the S4B users still using s4b client too since that's not wholesale done)
[11:15:10] <csws> webex for the management staff desperately trying to justify buying webex licenses
[11:15:49] <Oliber> i'd move our users over to teams phone system, but the licence cost is around 4x more expensive per head
[11:16:00] <csws> the people pushing webex at last job really missed the boat
[11:16:12] <Hunterkll> webex got a few good things going for it tho
[11:16:13] <csws> they started prior to 2020 but pissed around so much they completely lost the opportunity
[11:16:17] <Hunterkll> especially for remote support and shit like that
[11:16:20] <csws> they were finally "ready" to start onboarding users in june 2020...
[11:16:23] <csws> little too late welp
[11:17:13] <Hunterkll> i've got webex, bomgar, teams, and sfb for remote shit for the occasion i have to dive in and i pretty much prefer webex unless I have to use smart card redirection in a crazy way
[11:17:19] <csws> oh wow bomgar
[11:17:35] <Hunterkll> its pretty good - especially when you compare it price wise to LMIR
[11:17:38] <csws> don't think anyone over here has heard of it
[11:17:39] <Hunterkll> and we can host it onprem
[11:17:40] <Hunterkll> lol
[11:17:51] <csws> I used to use it when I was working in canada
[11:18:10] <csws> it was pretty good.. combination of that and LMI, which was ok also
[11:18:14] <Hunterkll> we've had a few incidents w here i've had to have the user's smartcard plugged in to my machine, while they're on the other side of the country, while I have my administrator smartcard plugged into my machine as well, and BOTH available via an RDP session from my laptop to a specific server with an admin console 
[11:18:20] <Hunterkll> bomgar actually can do that
[11:18:39] <Hunterkll> present a user's remote smart card as plugged in locally to an RDP session on my machine (if they're running the full bomgar agent on the remote machine)
[11:18:43] <Hunterkll> the remote machine being a mac, even
[11:18:56] <Hunterkll> talk about a use case and a half
[11:19:37] <Oliber> i've not seen bomgar mentioned for years, our student records system vendor used to use it, think they were the only one
[11:20:05] <Hunterkll> LMI's cloud only, not fedramp (though it meets the requirements for our usage for us to be able to use it) and was like 4x the cost when i was trying to push it

[11:28:28] <Activ8> I’m moving back from windows 11 to windows 10 I’ve had enough of the crashes for now.  Can’t even get docker stable or hyper-v.
[11:28:39] <Hunterkll> that's just fucking weird
[11:28:50] <Hunterkll> you update your bios?
[11:28:56] <Activ8> Went to install docker last night, system crashed again 
[11:29:07] <Activ8> yeh it’s up to date
[11:29:27] <Activ8> it was the same stop code as when I installed hyper-v
[11:29:30] <Hunterkll> somethin' non-windows smells dodgy, especially if you did a clean install 
[11:29:49] <Hunterkll> then again it is an AMD system, so it's dodgy in general :)
[11:29:59] <Activ8> indeed
[11:30:08] <Activ8> its fine I know what works for now

[11:31:47] <Activ8> I’ll only roll back on my desktop though.  Actually what I’ll do is install it on my laptop which is intel see if it works.  Might be something amd based or with it been old
[11:32:07] <Activ8> I only need to push something back up to my repo
[11:32:23] <Hunterkll> AMD's got a current flurry of issues on current supported stuff, so who knows......
[11:32:38] <Hunterkll> 'tis why I tend to avoid AMD 
[11:32:40] <Activ8> Yeh
[11:33:00] <Hunterkll> and it, just like the linux issues that i'm a fan of, will require conjoined code fixes in the kernel and AMD provided microcode updates/bios revisions 
[11:33:03] <csws> hey my shit works on win 10 :D
[11:33:08] <csws> the bios gave me issues though
[11:33:13] <csws> seemed to be due to some weird vcore shit
[11:33:41] <Hunterkll> i love it when i see shit in the linux kernel bugtrack that goes "AMD must fix" or "AMD is proposing a microcode update to fix" and shit
[11:33:43] <Hunterkll> lol
[11:34:02] <csws> some guy in here had the exact same issue
[11:34:05] <csws> it's a gigabyte mobo issue
[11:34:12] <Hunterkll> don't get me wrong, i'll use AMD, it's just a lot higher scenario based
[11:34:27] <csws> they crank the core voltage too high and it just causes POST failures.. which lead to the BIOS auto resetting as it thinks it's an OC failure (even if you're not OCing)
[11:34:43] <Hunterkll> when in doubt go intel for daily driver though, unless there's some pressing need or something unique for a specific thing 
[11:34:44] <csws> I moved it from "auto" to "normal" in the BIOS and now it isn't shitting itself thank god
[11:34:54] <Hunterkll> erm
[11:34:57] <Hunterkll> auto is trying to oc
[11:34:57] <Hunterkll> :D
[11:35:01] <csws> it's dumb
[11:35:09] <csws> so hypothetically auto might OC
[11:35:12] <csws> but then they don't enable XMP by default
[11:35:19] <csws> the settings don't make sense to me
[11:35:32] <Hunterkll> XMP isn't the only kind of overclocking you can do....
[11:35:43] <Hunterkll> turboboost like functionality alone is overclocking
[11:35:43] <Hunterkll> lol
[11:35:55] <Hunterkll> and XMP being on can only help modern AMD processors :/

[14:38:02] <Hunterkll> that doesn't mean that the data is getting anywhere meaningful, that just means the data's eventaully going to come back destination not reachable, or in an overload scenario request timed out

[14:41:44] <Hunterkll> at its core, it's still relying on the router to know where the next destination is - that's where IGP comes into play.

[18:10:52] <Activ8> for a lot of people it's out of range
[18:10:52] <Hunterkll> because of the cost
[18:10:56] <Hunterkll> and that's in 2003/2004 dollars

[18:58:55] <yuken> It's literally being ignored.

[18:59:40] <Activ8> employees do not get paid to interfere with anyone robbing.  I would never do that.

[19:00:59] <Hunterkll> @Hotmess in this case, the company has to actually press charges for the DA to be able to do anything
[19:01:06] <Activ8> I don't think suicide drones is the answer lol

[19:45:25] <vinrock> cant look like a buncha scrubs
[19:45:25] <signofzeta> ender: it can?  Awesome!  I thought Apple didn't bother putting x86 emulation into their ARM64 chips, because Catalina removed 32-bit support.
[19:45:31] <ender> getting Win10 AArch64 ISO might be a bit of a problem though
[19:45:46] <ender> signofzeta: Windows uses it's own emulation
[19:45:52] <signofzeta> yes, I'm aware that getting your hands on a legitimate and stable Win10 ARM ISO is damn near impossible.
[19:45:53] <teh_f4ll3n> we have plenty of those customers... we just tell them we don't support Macs for our x86 apps
[19:46:12] <ender> used to be available from Action Pack website, but not any more
[19:46:23] <teh_f4ll3n> if they want to make it work in parallels, it's up to them
[19:47:45] <Hunterkll> signofzeta: huh? you can just download it from VLSC ....
[19:48:02] <ender> Hunterkll: since when?
[19:48:12] <teh_f4ll3n> "you asked us for a recommendation on a new laptop. why did you get a mac after all that?" -- "the guy at the store said it would run everything a windows laptop will run much better"
[19:48:13] <signofzeta> Hunterkll: really?  $CLIENT_NAME is big enough that they'd sign up for VLSC to get Win10 ARM64.
[19:48:30] <Hunterkll> but.... it won't run on the mac....
[19:48:30] <signofzeta> teh_f4ll3n: yes, and that was true for several years -- until now.
[19:48:31] <vinrock> ender: uup.rg-adguard.net

[19:48:36] <ender> vinrock: i know
[19:48:50] <signofzeta> Hunterkll: virtualized through Parallels (which only supports ARM64 versions of Windows on M1 Macs)
[19:48:51] <ender> Hunterkll: it should work in Parallels
[19:49:14] *** Joins: BOWnbERTHA (~BOWnbERTH@178.239.165.203)
[19:49:47] <Hunterkll> and 'big enough' to buy one VL copy of windows
[19:49:48] <Hunterkll> lol
[19:50:16] <Hunterkll> note that VL copies of windows client are 'upgrade only' licenses so you still need a base retail/FPP license for each mac .... but if it's the same 'edition' you can just use reimaging rights i suppose..... 
[19:50:17] <signofzeta> "big enough" that if Microsoft said it'd cost them four or five figures, they wouldn't blink.  six figures would need approval.
[19:50:20] <teh_f4ll3n> M1 parallels doesn't emulate x86 instructions though, does it?
[19:50:28] <Hunterkll> signofzeta: try low 3 ....
[19:50:43] <Hunterkll> problem is legality of it though
[19:50:49] <signofzeta> teh_fall3n: Parallels doesn't emulate Intel, but I'm told Win10 ARM64 does.  Obviously a performance killer, but...
[19:50:54] <ender> teh_f4ll3n: neither does RPi4, but Windows runs in KVM running in it
[19:51:06] <Hunterkll> signofzeta: OS X emulates intel too for non-ARM OS X apps ...
[19:51:15] <Hunterkll> it'd be suicide not to
[19:51:18] <mistiry> remember that you are going to have to support this forever
[19:51:29] <mistiry> so the more janky a solution, the harder you are making your life
[19:51:44] <ender> M1 has some instructions that help with x86 emulation, but Windows doesn't make use of them
[19:51:49] <signofzeta> Believe me, if the answer is to get a Windows Insider subscription, that's off the table.
[19:51:52] <teh_f4ll3n> that's going to be a PITA to support
[19:52:09] <Hunterkll> using parallels + standard windows ISO is the same UX/support load as doing it on an x86 mac
[19:52:11] <signofzeta> I don't have an M1 MacBook (and my wife won't let me borrow hers), so I can't test anything.
[19:52:33] <signofzeta> the people using Windows in Parallels on macOS are techy people.  I just have to tell them what to do and they do it.

[19:54:01] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> Same with Win11
[19:54:16] <Hunterkll> signofzeta: windows for ARM is only licensed to OEMs for installation on a new PC and that's *IT*

[19:54:48] <spiderman> what a load of shit
[19:54:57] <signofzeta> So it's technically possible, but logistically impossible.
[19:55:08] <teh_f4ll3n> pretty much it seems
[19:55:11] <Hunterkll> signofzeta: that ISO is a standard windows install ISO for ARM, but it's meant for businesses taking the wim to reimage their surface pro X's with custom internal image and shit f rom SCCM 
[19:55:12] <Hunterkll> etc
[19:55:25] <signofzeta> and these guys do government contracts, and after a Business Software Alliance lawsuit a few decades ago, they will ONLY do what is legally allowed.

[19:56:11] <signofzeta> agreed, mistiry.  keeps my nose clean.
[19:56:36] <signofzeta> unlike my last job, my new employer doesn't want to have to remember all of their various lies.
[19:56:41] <mistiry> i fucking hate when places willfully lie to get around licensing, especially when its a software company. like...you _rely_ on people paying license fees, and yet try to fuck other companies out of it?
[19:57:41] <signofzeta> I had an architecture firm as a client, many years ago.  before I joined them, they tried to skirt AutoCAD licensing.  A fired employee tipped off the BSA.  They settled with Autodesk for $25K -- not easy for a small business.  Since then, they've been on the straight and narrow.  They now do Autodesk 360 for everyone.
[19:57:45] <teh_f4ll3n> it's the usual "it's OK if *I* do it", mistiry 
[19:57:58] <signofzeta> No word on what the former employee received as a reward, but I'm sure it was beer money at best.
