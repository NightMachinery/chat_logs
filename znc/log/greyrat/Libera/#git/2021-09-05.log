[01:07:28] <ZacSharp> you add "https://github.com/kestrel1974/openwrt.git" as a remote (I would use `git remote add kestrel1974 "https://github.com/kestrel1974/openwrt.git"`)
[01:08:14] <docmax> ok and then?
[01:08:22] <ZacSharp> then you can just checkout remotes/kestrel1974/ltq-deu or ltq-deu
[01:08:41] <ZacSharp> in the latter case git will create a local branch following the pr branch
[01:09:11] <ZacSharp> the first case results in a detached HEAD (being on no branch at all, just at some commit)

[01:12:13] <ZacSharp> little mistake on my side, it's kestrel1974/ltq-deu, without remotes/
[01:12:51] <ZacSharp> just checking out ltq-deu should work though, unless the main repo has that branch as well
[01:14:08] <euouae> osse but what would you do if you wanted to record your .bashrc?
[01:14:14] <docmax> ok, works. a "git remote update" was missing
[01:14:19] <osse> the original repo also has references for all pull requests
[01:14:40] <osse> so there is no need to add the originating repo as a second remote
[01:15:17] <docmax> osse, then how would you do it?
[01:15:19] <osse> something like  git fetch origin refs/pull/4326/head:refs/heads/somename
[01:15:25] <osse> and then you have branch somename
[01:16:06] <osse> euouae: ln -s ~/whatever/myrepo/.bashrc ~/.bashrc

[09:54:48] <johnny> FH_thecat, the answer to the question of "can i override X config option on the cli" is 99% likely to to be yes. it should be in the man page

[10:09:41] <johnny> is that one of the arguments?
[10:10:24] <johnny> did you read the man page?
[10:10:31] <FH_thecat> diffr is name of the highlighter that I want to use instead of the default diff-highlight
[10:10:44] <johnny> diftool isn't about highlighting
[10:11:14] <FH_thecat> OK, so what should I use, then ?
[10:12:21] <johnny> did you read the man page tho?
[10:12:36] <johnny> the manpage literally says that --tool only works with specific tools
[10:12:50] <johnny> then it says you can do other things
[10:13:23] <johnny> like the -x option

[10:13:54] <johnny> but you do have to pass it specific args for the tools as per the instructions
[10:14:54] <johnny> basically --tool only works with sepcific tools because the cli for the tools are usually different in which way they take arguments for the 2 or 3 way revisions
[10:15:02] <johnny> 2 or 3 way diffs
[10:15:26] <FH_thecat> johnny: if you know how to do it, why don't you tell me?
[10:15:29] <johnny> i don't
[10:15:32] <johnny> i just said it could be done
[10:15:58] <johnny> you asked if it could be done, and i told you that it can be :)

[10:16:56] <johnny> of course the best solution in the end is to get get diff to support your diffr tool in tools by submitted a patch
[10:17:12] <johnny> to get diff.tool to support your diffr program that is
[10:17:21] <johnny> so difftool can work

[10:19:19] <gnoo> https://github.com/mookid/diffr
[10:20:48] <johnny> i just did a terrrible rebase recently and it reminded me that i need a semantic differ
[10:21:28] <johnny> it's freakin dumb wen you renme a function and provide the old function name as a fallback with the origianl args that it can't tell that the new name is a new function and not to diff it as if there were a change, but rather a totally new function

[13:49:38] <gitinfo> gnoo: Worried about your data while trying stuff out in your repo? The repository in its entirety lives inside the .git directory in the root of your work tree so to backup everything `cp -a path/to/workdir path/to/backup` or equivalent will suffice as long as the repo is not modified during backup. See also http://sethrobertson.github.com/GitBestPractices/#backups

[15:27:46] <sverzel> I'm at a new project phase where we'll start up several teams basing from the same code base. Going forward I think there might be a need to introduce incompatible changes in various teams code. Given this, what would be an intelligent approach repository-wise? One repository and a branch per project which might pull-request into master and which is ultimately a persistent team branch? Or use a repository per team?
[15:29:00] <sverzel> ("team" and "project" used interchangeably)
[15:31:23] <nedbat> sverzel: incompatible changes? You mean teams need to maintain their own code that other teams don't want?
[15:31:38] <sverzel> nedbat, yes exactly
[15:31:56] <sverzel> and I realize this is a bit tricky in the soft area of evaluating commonality etc.
[15:32:37] <nedbat> sverzel: i wouldn't have a directory per team then.  i wouldn't try to keep long branches that shouldn't be merged
[15:32:54] <nedbat> oops: I *would* have a directory per team.
[15:32:57] <sverzel> it might sound strange, but this project is a data platform project where some teams might deal with formats particular to a specific system or they might be generic, too.
[15:33:06] <sverzel> nedbat, a directory i.e. a repo?
[15:33:24] <nedbat> sverzel: it could be a separate repo, but i meant a directory within one repo
[15:34:02] <sverzel> nedbat, oh, OK. Need to let that sink in what that would mean in my case..
[15:34:33] <sverzel> the project has various components, e.g. a database component, code transformation component, etc. They should all be deployed to a team-specific target environment.
[15:35:11] <j416> sounds a bit like you're trying to use git as a dependency manager
[15:35:38] <sverzel> j416, yes, that is one concern I might be conflating the tool with perhaps
[15:35:58] <j416> it might work but I don't think it's optimal
[15:36:34] <j416> single repo is of course one way to overcome it, but then working multiple teams on one repo has its own issues
[15:36:55] <sverzel> yeah, exactly. Not trivial to figure out the pros and cons.
[15:37:24] <j416> I think the biggest con would be the humans; you'd need to define some way of working and communicate that across all teams
[15:37:33] <j416> easier said than done I bet
[15:37:48] <sverzel> indeed, that's one problem I'd be forced to handle
[15:38:15] <sverzel> basically I want distributed teams with local self-rule but be able to still have central influence. I guess I'm describing a unicorn.
[15:38:40] <j416> without knowing many details about your project, I'd strive towards multiple repos
[15:39:13] <sverzel> j416, I'll read up on it more, but it's possible to pull-request from one repo to another, right?

[15:39:55] <j416> pull requests, while git has them, I think you are referring to the github thing, correct?
[15:40:13] <j416> you'll want all repos to share the same history, then
[15:40:20] <j416> which would be difficult since they'd all be diverged
[15:40:43] <sverzel> it's Azure DevOps, but basically the same thing
[15:40:48] <j416> if that's what you're planning to do, maybe rethink, or see yourselves as one giant team working on the repo
[15:40:55] <nedbat> i guess i would try to have a repo for what all teams share, and separate repos for the things teams need to be unique
[15:41:11] <j416> ^ yes, something like this
[15:41:32] <j416> then again I don't know what you are building so difficult to give much advice
[15:41:54] <sverzel> indeed.. I need to think on how common/unique would possibly overlap code-wise.
[15:42:03] <j416> a lot of problems in git and teams come down to workflow issues
[15:42:04] *** Quits: jetchisel (jetchisel@user/jetchisel) (Quit: Unfortunately time is always against us -- [Morpheus])
[15:42:40] <sverzel> exactly.. I'm trying to figure out how the process would look and that it won't create bottlenecks on a "central team" i.e. the people who decide what goes into the main platform.
[15:43:19] <j416> the more people you have on your team(s) working with one repo, the less structure it inevitably gets, unless you have some kind of merge liutenant responsible for keeping the repo in good shape
[15:43:29] <sverzel> there's a main platform that is offered to teams, but singular teams have issues that are particular to only that team since they deal with data formats. etc. that other teams don't care about.
[15:43:54] <j416> I'd try to have one team perhaps responsible for the data formats, then.
[15:44:25] <sverzel> I suspect it might not scale, but I need to think more on that I guess.

[15:45:23] *** HaxPenguino is now known as CoCoHaxPenguin
[15:45:29] <nedbat> sverzel: why not have a "data_formats" directory, with a subdirectory for each format?
[15:45:37] <sverzel> I think that's a good point. Isolate things that are not up for public discussion and break off the parts that may be edited.
[15:46:09] <sverzel> nedbat, it's one way but currently the solution is not built nice enough to have modules like that. Maybe that's yet something to work with, too.
[15:46:53] <j416> I believe in independent autonomous teams with clear responsibilities; trying to work on the same code from multiple teams creates a lot of headache in terms of overhead in both lead times and reduced quality, in my experience
[15:46:55] <sverzel> seems obvious to split common/non-common but I hadn't thought of it that way. That is the way I need to go.
[15:47:19] <sverzel> j416, exactly what I want to avoid. It'll create way too much debate and discussions.
[15:47:29] <j416> PRs to other teams are fine, but I would avoid having some "all teams own all the things and no one is responsible" wild west
[15:47:51] <sverzel> indeed, that'll drop on my own head.
[15:48:20] <sverzel> better clearly define what's changeable on a team level and what's centrally managed (for order).
[15:48:41] <sverzel> with as little as possible centrally managed for interest of speed and flexibility.
[15:49:24] <sverzel> e.g. all infrastructure centrally managed and stubs of code, database design, etc.
[15:50:00] <j416> why not per-project?
[15:50:00] <sverzel> then I'm thinking good generic code can be merged to said code stubs.
[15:50:14] <j416> the definition of good code changes fast over time
[15:50:36] <sverzel> infrastructure per-project can probably become cumbersome to deploy and maintain.
[15:50:49] <sverzel> well yes, I guess. But it can be edited over time, too.

[15:51:31] <sverzel> to give some background this is in Azure and teams will map to a specific resource group which holds databases, various code, etc.
[15:51:51] <sverzel> so there will be multiple teams and therefore multiple resource groups with similar setup inside.
[15:51:52] <j416> we've pondered having some kind of stubs/template repo with things that are built to good standards, but always arrived at the conclusion that no one would spend the time to maintain it
[15:52:19] <j416> now, we typically just look at recent projects whenever we write something new, to steal new (and old) ideas
[15:52:43] <sverzel> ah yes. I've seen that too. Rather than stubs I guess I mean a starting point of a working solution to read and write data from source to destination. But a team might need to edit that in the middle to add transformations etc.
[15:53:36] <sverzel> my dilemma is that I want some control but not be a dictator and suffocate progress.
[15:53:41] <j416> I also would try to map infrastructure to each project, so that it becomes easy to see which project depends on what, and even sandbox that.
