[01:55:05] <esaym153> found a chunk of code that was actually using env vars: https://github.com/Soni295/insta-clon/blob/main/frontend/src/services/login.js not sure if there is an easy way to create that or something similar

[02:01:11] <esaym153> FunkyBob: well I mean in templates you'd have something like <form action="{% url create_view %}">... but clearly js files doesn't go through templating

[02:04:19] <esaym153> FunkyBob: was thinking maybe there was something slick like python manage.py create_endpoints which could drop a file with api endpoints that you could import via node during bundling. (something like show_urls but that has the wrong format)
[02:04:58] <esaym153> of course not hard to make myself, but I assume if it is not done already, then it must be a stupid idea :-/

[03:48:39] <FunkyBob> PaulWay[w]: also wonder what drives a company to include language comprehension in their hiring test
[03:48:42] <FunkyBob> then again...
[03:49:24] <PaulWay[w]> It's not language comprehension, it's logic.
[03:50:04] <FunkyBob> it's both
[03:50:12] <wallbroken> to me the right answers are the first and the third
[03:50:14] <PaulWay[w]> OK, yes.
[03:50:17] <wallbroken> do you agree with me?
[03:50:26] <PaulWay[w]> It's language comprehension and logic comprehension.
[03:51:00] <PaulWay[w]> There was a study I heard about about a decade ago where they tests first year university students in computing with tests like that.
[03:51:28] <PaulWay[w]> Simple logical tests and sequential programming tests.
[03:51:47] <PaulWay[w]> E.g. 'a = 1; b = a; what does b equal?'
[03:52:08] <PaulWay[w]> And they found a third of the students had no coherent grasp of logic at all.
[03:52:17] <PaulWay[w]> Their answers were basically random.
[03:52:50] <FunkyBob> All water is wet. This is wet. Is it water?
[03:53:10] <PaulWay[w]> That kind of thing, yes.
[03:53:54] <PaulWay[w]> And Lewis Carroll wrote a large number of increasingly silly logical tests like that.
[03:54:12] <wallbroken> so, can you answer to my question please?
[03:54:20] <PaulWay[w]> Why?
[03:54:55] <wallbroken> because i failed the test but it's not written which answers are wrong
[03:55:12] <wallbroken> and I'm trying to figure it out by myself

[14:10:50] <jbooker> the code where you load the jpg file then save it as a png - where is that running? Are you just manually running that for testing?
[14:11:05] <pycode> jbooker, inside a shell python manage.py shell
[14:11:10] <jbooker> ok no problem
[14:11:15] <pycode> i see the record on db

[14:11:37] <pycode> https://bpa.st/I6JA

[14:12:02] <pycode> i only see the file with the same name i used during save

[14:12:07] <jbooker> I agree, you should based on its documentation

[14:12:36] <pycode> i do not understand because the saving is working i do not get any error
[14:12:41] <pycode> just i do not see avatar
[14:12:51] <pycode> it seems like a normal django imagefield
[14:14:19] <jbooker> Well you're saving the image (and renaming it as a png, when the source is a jpg)
[14:15:36] <pycode> wait
[14:16:09] <pycode> jbooker, same problem
[14:16:17] <pycode> i see django created a file called paolo_WmfPfaB.jpg

[14:16:59] <pycode> so i have the file and the record is updated
[14:17:05] <jbooker> OK
[14:17:08] <pycode> but easy-thumbnails is not working
[14:17:19] <jbooker> So you have the image working, can you reference the image (not thumbnail) directly
[14:17:34] <pycode> jbooker, yes if i do user.photo.url i see that url
[14:17:49] <pycode> no the thumb...but as i wrote i do not see avatar,big,small
[14:18:07] <pycode> so i suppose easy-thumbnail did not work
[14:18:14] <jbooker> I don't think it even ran
[14:18:15] <pycode> i just added 'easy_thumbnails', on installed apps
[14:18:21] <pycode> and the configuration i showen above
[14:18:24] <jbooker> but its supposed to do it on the fly
[14:18:35] <jbooker> did you 'load easy_thumbnails' at the top of your template?
[14:18:38] <pycode> yes exactly i do not thing it ran
[14:18:47] <pycode> {% load thumbnail %}
[14:19:38] <pycode> https://easy-thumbnails.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage/#templates
[14:20:55] <jbooker> I think it's the way you're saving the image in the Shell
[14:21:14] <jbooker> ThumbnailerImageField extends the ImageField class, but doesn't override the Save() method
[14:21:34] <jbooker> so when you're saving your image in the shell, you're not actually doing anything different to a normal ImageFIeld
[14:21:37] <pycode> i think the problem is the shell too
[14:21:41] <jbooker> See https://github.com/SmileyChris/easy-thumbnails/blob/master/easy_thumbnails/fields.py
[14:22:01] <pycode> i added the save at the end too https://bpa.st/43AA
[14:22:03] <pycode> let me see
[14:22:34] <pycode> jbooker, so how can i "simulate" a form upload ?
[14:22:51] <jbooker> after you added easy_thumbnails to `INSTALLED_APPS` you did remember to run 'migrate' didn't you?
[14:22:59] <pycode> yes
[14:23:05] <jbooker> regarding simulating a form upload, use the admin site that's what it's for
[14:23:29] <jbooker> actually that may not work if they haven't scaffolded that out hold on
[14:23:31] <pycode> jbooker, i easy_thumbnails_source table
[14:23:31] <pycode> i see
[14:23:38] <pycode> users/photos/paolo_WmfPfaB.jpg
[14:23:51] <pycode> with 2021-10-15 12:45:50.480 +0200
[14:23:56] <jbooker> hm, so it did do some of the work, then
[14:24:00] <pycode> so the save() has updated that table too
[14:24:01] <jbooker> have you got DEBUG turned on?
[14:24:05] <pycode> yes
[14:24:33] <jbooker> "whenever a thumbnail does not exist or if the source was modified more recently than the existing thumbnail, a new thumbnail is generated (and saved)." (from the docs)

[14:25:30] <pycode> jbooker, yes but i supposed AFTER a real upload
[14:26:55] <bancroft> dodo: I assume it's frowned upon to put it in the view?
[14:28:31] <jbooker> pycode maybe try this: https://bpa.st/TW3Q

[14:31:17] <pycode> same thing same user
[14:31:24] <pycode> object.user and user are the same object
[14:31:36] <pycode> and as i wrote i load it doing {% load thumbnail %}
[14:31:39] <pycode> at the beginning
[14:32:13] <jbooker> OK
[14:32:29] <jbooker> change your THUMBNAIL_ALIASES settings to not name the object:
[14:32:47] <pycode> in template if i do user.photo.url i see the media url and i can see the photo but in that case i am not using easy-thumbnail
[14:32:48] <jbooker> https://bpa.st/VS2A
[14:32:59] <pycode> yeah already did it
[14:34:27] <pycode> jbooker,
[14:34:29] <pycode> waaaaaaaaaait
[14:34:32] <pycode> not it is working
[14:34:52] <pycode> jbooker, why??
[14:34:52] <pycode> https://bpa.st/WACQ
[14:34:57] <pycode> i have commented the other won
[14:35:00] <pycode> others one
[14:35:33] <jbooker> well you didn't paste the other ones before
[14:35:37] <jbooker> you only showed the first one
[14:36:05] <pycode> jbooker, yes you are right but why? whats the problem?
[14:36:15] <pycode> there are no conflicts i used different alias no?
[14:36:18] <jbooker> paste the THUMBNAIL_ALIASES you had
[14:36:26] <pycode>  https://bpa.st/WACQ
[14:36:26] <jbooker> ALL of it, as it might just be a syntax error
[14:36:49] <jbooker> No, that's after you commented out the other two and moved the closing brace
[14:36:58] <jbooker> before you did that how did it look
[14:37:46] <pycode> https://bpa.st/OHOQ
[14:37:48] <pycode> this is working now
[14:37:56] <pycode> i suppose runserver had some problem or something...i do not know
[14:39:01] <pycode> ok the problem is --> 'apps.core.User.photo'
[14:39:04] <pycode> why?
[14:39:11] <pycode> apps is the folder where i put all the applications
[14:39:17] <pycode> core is the name of the base application
[14:39:20] <pycode> User is the model
[14:39:22] <pycode> photo is the field
[14:39:29] <pycode> how can i call it?
[14:39:57] <jbooker> I don't know
[14:40:10] <jbooker> I've never put apps in a subdirectory
[14:40:19] <jbooker> got to step out
[14:40:38] <pycode> i try to use 'User.photo': {
[14:40:59] <jbooker> actually you shouldn't need 'apps'
[14:41:05] <jbooker> just core.User.photo should suffice
[14:41:10] <jbooker> core is your app name
[14:41:12] <pycode> no work User.photo
[14:41:18] <pycode> yes i try that
[14:41:29] <jbooker> at the point this is being processed, the 'apps' is irrelevant as it's a model name not a file path
[14:41:58] <pycode> jbooker, BINGO
[14:42:03] <pycode> it is working properly
[14:42:09] <pycode> core.User.photo is the correct one

[18:20:35] <dbedrenko> The field-name is a common string and the codebase is quite large so looking for ways better than the obvious `grep`
[18:24:30] <GinFuyou> Consider changing ide if it can't do such a simple task?

[18:26:45] <dbedrenko> GinFuyou, the IDE would have to interpret Django's particular query syntax like `old_field_name__isnull`, can you recommend one that does and is able to rename those?

[18:27:19] <theprophet>  py manage.py sqlmigrate polls 0001 does this command work for postgresSQL?
[18:27:43] <GinFuyou> there is nothing particular about it, it just about matching search inside strings or by regexp
[18:28:14] <GinFuyou> I don't use IDE, but Kate editor has a number of search options that always helped me
[18:28:57] <theprophet> GinFuyou are you talking with me?
[18:29:10] <GinFuyou> nope
[18:29:30] <theprophet> can somebody please help me with my question?
[18:29:36] <dbedrenko> A string search is not much better than grepping the codebase. As I said the field name is a common word that gets used in all sorts of places in this large codebase
[18:30:29] <GinFuyou> theprophet, postgres is official supported backend, so pretty sure it works
[18:30:57] <theprophet> GinFuyou i see thanks.
[18:31:07] <GinFuyou> dbedrenko, even more reason TO use string search?
[18:33:48] <dbedrenko> GinFuyou, how so? I'll get 500 search matches to look through, only let's say 10% of which are actually where I need to rename, the rest are irrelevant
[18:34:33] <dbedrenko> Probably less than that, like 20 out of those 500 are what I'm looking for, i.e. queries
[18:36:15] <GinFuyou> To make sure you renamed everything relevant and didn't anything irrelevant. 500 doesn't sound that many. I guess your question was about some smart way like object analysis to know when it refers model's member? I don't know of a such tool
[18:37:04] <GinFuyou> obviously you can look for queries with regex searching for (pseudocode) (_)?<name>(_)?
[18:38:13] <dbedrenko> Yeah I think by Python's nature there are no such tools, I'll have to comb through it myself. Thanks anyway
[18:39:20] <GinFuyou> there might be for object members but it won't help with queries anyway
[18:42:14] <dbedrenko> Object member one would be really nice. PyCharm is too dumb, it doesn't have insight on them

[20:52:27] <djapo> does transaction.atomic create race conditions ?
[20:53:08] <djapo> I have a strange bug, where for each row in a dataframe I load that row to my db and each row is in an atomic transaction
[20:53:42] <djapo> problem is that some of the rows are ending up with data from a previous row
[20:54:04] <djapo> and it is often more than one row that has that data.
[20:54:40] <djapo> err .. i mean only one row in the dataframe should have the data but in the db more than one row ends up with the data
