[11:36:56] <apollo13> mad_moses: you can put it in the root of your templates lookups
[11:37:02] <apollo13> if you want to customize it
[11:38:20] <mad_moses> apollo13: yes I want. Just wandering if I head to add something special into the template? Like a 404 header or a 404 title
[11:38:42] <apollo13> mad_moses: no, whatever you want, ie see https://google.at/asd

[12:53:56] <mad_moses> but with disabled debug i can not see the error message
[12:53:58] <mad_moses> what can i do?
[12:54:28] <serafeim> mad_moses: i told you to visit this page: https://www.spapas.net/2015/04/29/django-show-404-page/
[12:54:30] <serafeim> you did  not.
[12:55:11] <mad_moses> serafeim: thank you
[13:00:17] <mad_moses> serafeim: with debug=True and your solution the 404 page is loading proparly
[13:00:29] <mad_moses> serafeim: but if I set it to false it is not working ...

[14:40:34] <serafeim> i run it on prod

[14:42:28] *** GinF is now known as GinFuyou
[14:43:14] <GinFuyou> collectstatic usually meant for production, but there are some different scenarios about serving static and media
[14:48:28] <serafeim> here's what i more or less do when deploying on prod https://github.com/spapas/mailer_server/blob/master/fabfile.py#L32

[14:55:54] <apollo13> mad_moses: that mostly depends on your deployment strategy. For instance with docker containers you'd probably precreate those etcâ€¦
[14:59:40] <mad_moses> GinFuyou: actually it is only collect static. But running this command takes 1-2 minutes on my server.
[15:00:44] <serafeim> lol why
[15:00:45] <apollo13> slow server is slow :D
[15:00:47] <serafeim> you'
[15:00:53] <serafeim> you're doing something wrong
[15:01:07] <serafeim> the collectstatic won't do work if the fiels are already copied
[15:01:30] <mad_moses> hmm, I always remove everything before i run collectstatic
[15:01:33] <mad_moses> wrong approach?
[15:01:38] <serafeim> yes
[15:01:41] <apollo13> no, but 2 minutes is still rather slow
[15:01:51] <serafeim> see what i do in the fabfile i pasted
[15:01:56] <mad_moses> okay, I will investigate this
[15:01:58] <serafeim> that's the proper way to deploy it
[15:02:05] <apollo13> removing is good to get rid of old files
[15:02:10] <serafeim> at least that's whatt i'm doing in like tens of apps in more than 10 years
[15:02:14] <serafeim> apollo13: why do that
[15:02:16] <mad_moses> serafeim: which file?
[15:02:21] <serafeim> https://github.com/spapas/mailer_server/blob/master/fabfile.py#L32
[15:02:27] <apollo13> serafeim: as I said, to get rid of files that no longer exist
[15:02:37] <serafeim> apollo13: does not seem to worth it for me
[15:03:09] <apollo13> well I usually deploy into an empty folder anyways that is versioned with the release we deploy
[15:03:23] <apollo13> otherwise old code might refer new css/js etcâ€¦
[15:03:31] <mad_moses> serafeim: what is a fabfile?
[15:03:51] <serafeim> mad_moses: https://github.com/ploxiln/fab-classic
[15:04:14] <serafeim> apollo13: why would old code refer new css ?
[15:04:14] <mad_moses> thx
[15:04:29] <serafeim> as i said i'm using this for over 10 years and never had any problems
[15:04:56] <apollo13> serafeim: because a link like /static/test.css will fetch the newest version
[15:05:12] <apollo13> so if the old python code (webserver process) is still running your site will fetch the new css
[15:05:17] <apollo13> which can be problematic
[15:05:32] <serafeim> mad_moses: make sure to use fab-classic and *not* fabric
[15:05:43] <apollo13> this obviously doesn't happen with hashed file storages but then you even more wwant a new directory to make sure to clean up the old data
[15:06:17] <serafeim> apollo13: but i will restart my webserver when deploying
[15:06:19] <mad_moses> I will investigate first why it takes so long. The server is faster then  my machine (intel i5 6600k)
[15:06:32] <serafeim> so why would it use the old files ?
[15:06:35] <apollo13> serafeim: sure but in the timeframe between collectatic and restarting the webserver?
[15:06:59] <apollo13> mad_moses: collectstatic (depending on the backends) can do plenty of work (like minimizing etc)
[15:07:01] <serafeim> well that happens in a fab file one after the other. there's no such timeframe
[15:07:17] <apollo13> so it is not unheard off that it takes long, but you might want to investigate
[15:07:19] <apollo13> serafeim: LOL
[15:07:31] <apollo13> serafeim: you think one after another means zero time?
[15:08:05] <mad_moses> apollo13: yes, it is minimizing stuff
[15:08:07] <serafeim> apollo13: no it may be some time. but i don't really care about that :)
[15:08:31] <apollo13> serafeim: well yes, you might not care for your simple deploy to one server or so. But rolling out to a fleet is a different story
[15:08:40] <serafeim> ok then
[15:08:41] <apollo13> mad_moses: so yeah, might be that 1-2 minutes are okay then
[15:08:46] <serafeim> and i don't deploy to a fleet
[15:08:54] <serafeim> so until i do i'll keep using my good ol' fabfile
[15:09:07] <serafeim> so until i do (which will be *never*) i'll keep using my good ol' fabfile
[15:09:21] <apollo13> sure, no worries. I never said that you should or so. I just said that old code can see new css -- more I didn't want to say (you objected to that ;))
[15:09:34] <serafeim> yes ok this may happen
[15:09:46] <serafeim> but in 99% of use cases it won't matter
[15:10:05] <apollo13> let's say in your use case it will probably not matter :)
[15:10:23] <apollo13> but our deployments often take an hour or so
[15:10:36] <serafeim> uh oh
[15:10:47] <apollo13> we slowly deploy a few servers and let a few users onto it
[15:10:51] <apollo13> then we see how it behaves
[15:11:04] <apollo13> then you slowly add more server till you have the full farm deployed
[15:11:20] <serafeim> crazy
[15:11:32] <serafeim> lucky i'm not a devops for that
[15:11:54] <apollo13> well actually it is pretty great, you can do amazing things with that
[15:12:01] <apollo13> like measuring if response times are getting worse etcâ€¦
[15:12:14] <serafeim> yea i guess
[15:12:29] <apollo13> but yeah, many sites won't care or need that

[21:45:36] <evilpyro> Hi! I'm starting my journey learning django but I have some experience with fastapi/flask and ORMs, right now I'm trying to implement a login/register system and I've been reading tutorials. It seems django relies on the auth app, which already implements this with the default User model. My question is: should i use that if i plan to use a custom User and also plan to add email verification and other login methods?
[21:46:29] *** Quits: bambanxx (~bambanx@2800:150:106:1061:9c7f:3c97:315c:da8) (Quit: My MacBook Air has gone to sleep. ZZZzzzâ€¦)
[21:46:29] <Kipe_> evilpyro: you can do email verification with the basic User model
[21:47:17] <Kipe_> evilpyro: main reasons for replacing it with a custom one is if you plan to modify it a lot, and can't do that via a UserProfile model or something
[21:47:48] <Kipe_> evilpyro: for example I quite often replace the user model if I want to force usernames to be emails, just as an example
[21:48:25] <evilpyro> will my custom login work with apps like admin? can i disable the auth app but keeping admin?
[21:48:43] <Kipe_> don't disable auth.
[21:49:01] <Kipe_> and yes, custom user model will work with admin
[21:51:08] <evilpyro> why i should't disable auth? also, if i want to add roles/groups with a custom one do i need to do something extra? Can you recommend me a tutorial on this topic? (custom auth)
[21:52:51] <Kipe_> I haven't found a reason to replace the groups included in auth, just extending them via OneToOneField or ForeignKey has been enough
[21:53:26] <Kipe_> if you disable auth, you have to do sooooooooo much yourself (and you're very likely to just create amazingly bad security issues)
[21:53:44] <Kipe_> as well as admin, many addons etc rely on the auth

[22:10:23] <zamba> but i have already swapped out the built-in user model.. since i want to have email as username
[22:10:25] <zamba> how can i point to that?
[22:10:39] <zamba> Field defines a relation with the model 'auth.User', which has been swapped out.
[22:10:41] <zamba>         HINT: Update the relation to point at 'settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL'.
[22:10:51] <zamba> i wish this would explain itself.. but unfortunately it doesn't
[22:11:07] <zamba> i read what it says and i should be able to understand it and fix it, but django's a bit too complicated in this regard
[22:11:50] <zamba> i have already changed AUTH_USER_MODELS in settings.py

[23:39:21] <soxfoxrox> I have a model "Article" where users can vote for articles they like. I have a simply algorithm to calculate a score based on the number of votes for an article divided by the age of the article, which I have defined as a @property for my model: https://dpaste.org/bHcy. Is it possible to calculate the score as an annotation instead so I can sort articles by score?

[23:48:22] <nbjoerg> soxfoxrox: you can annotate with F objects
[23:49:56] <nbjoerg> soxfoxrox: and you can also look at "Func" for the date handling part
[23:55:16] <soxfoxrox> nbjoerg, just to get started, I've tried what I thought would be the syntax for getting the difference between the age of an article and the current time:
[23:55:17] <soxfoxrox> Article.objects.annotate(score=F(Now())-F('created_at'))
[23:55:57] <soxfoxrox> But this gets me an error: 'Now' object has no attribute 'split'
[23:57:55] *** Joins: Stench (~Staunch@c-24-7-237-208.hsd1.mn.comcast.net)
[23:59:46] <nbjoerg> shouldn't that be Now() - F('created_at') ?
