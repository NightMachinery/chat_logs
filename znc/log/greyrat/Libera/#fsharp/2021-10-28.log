[18:31:58] <sonny> how would I get the next element of the sequence seq { 1..10 }? I am using the interpreter and I just want to get the next item
[18:35:35] <sonny> I'm motivated by the idea to turn a file into a sequence https://bpa.st/BBGA

[19:27:56] <biberu> sonny: context? usually you'd pipe it to Seq.map, Seq.collect, Seq.take etc to transform the stream into what you need
[19:30:43] <sonny> ok, I need something custom then
[19:31:30] <biberu> sonny: e.g. lines |> Seq.collect (fun line -> line.Split(' ')) |> Seq.map (fun word -> word.ToUpper()) // split lines into words and merge those back into the seq, transform each word to uppercase
[19:31:30] <sonny> I wanted to make some sate machines that have a character parameter, and use Seq.next or something to pass the parameters in
[19:35:35] <MatthiasVance> Does anyone have a clue what the best method is to go from string to executing F#?
[19:36:01] <MatthiasVance> Like, in C# I'd probably use expressions to build something, then compile it and store the result

[20:26:03] <akronymus[m]> Funnily enough I made a simple, and bad, brainfuck interpreter in f# today.
[20:26:40] <akronymus[m]> Unless you want to literally convert it to IL
[20:31:54] <biberu> MatthiasVance: I guess you found code quotations?
[20:33:03] <MatthiasVance> Yes and I don't know if they somehow can be compiled to an assembly type thing?
[20:33:54] <MatthiasVance> So that I can save it to disk and reuse later
[20:35:31] *** Joins: stenno (~stenno@user/stenno)
[20:45:39] <biberu> ah, sorry, don't know that either
[21:13:01] <MatthiasVance> yeah it's less about interpreting (because there are multiple ways for that) and more about really compiling down to F#
