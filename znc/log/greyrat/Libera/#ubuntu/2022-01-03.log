[07:32:23] <milktoast64> I'm aware of Linux systems using Active Directory for user authentication from some old jobs. Currently, I'm in a new and small org. I'd like to know if there is a user authentication system for a domain where each user can log into all desktops? I'd like to not have local authentication on each desktop per user. Our current desktops are Windows,
[07:32:24] <milktoast64> Mac and Linux. We are going to gradually move all desktops to Linux and still have small amount of Mac and Win. We would like to not use any Microsoft Authentication servers.
[07:32:24] <milktoast64> Thanks

[23:20:59] <biapy> Guest59, if your network cable is between two PC, you MUST use a crossover network cable . NOT a standard network cable like the one between a PC and a router or hub or switch

[23:23:13] <biapy> leftyfb, i know, just still surprised that nfs survived to this day.
[23:23:14] <oerheks> or maybe 15?
[23:23:16] <leftyfb> anything with gigabit has a feature called Auto-MDIX as part of the spec. No crossover needed

[23:25:03] <leftyfb> Guest59: step #1  upgrade or reinstall your machine running 21.04 and your problem of mounting the drive should go away and you'll get support for it here. If you do a fresh install of 20.04 or 21.10, your problem will 100% go away

[23:48:49] <biapy> Guest59, dit you mount the drive manually ?
[23:49:06] <ducasse> Guest59: you need to show us logs if that command hangs, as that's where the error will be
[23:49:37] <Guest59> it does not hang
[23:50:13] <ducasse> ok, try 'touch /mnt/sdc1/testfile'
[23:50:15] <biapy> Guest59, I agree with ducasse: ls should not be able to list anything if the mount was unsuccessfull.... it's really strange.

[23:50:43] <Guest59> well it is mounted, I can read the files but not create
[23:50:48] <Guest59> ls also does not work

[23:52:27] <Guest59> it also has unsupported ubuntu
[23:52:35] <ducasse> you might be able to write and still have it throw errors, did you check the logs on the other machine?
[23:52:36] <biapy> Guest59, my guest is a usb problem rather than a disk problem

[23:52:54] <ducasse> yeah i suggested that earlier

[23:54:30] <Guest59> 150 gb
[23:54:31] <Guest59> to move
[23:55:12] <Guest59> I understand formatting this device
[23:55:15] <Guest59> will make it work
[23:55:24] <Guest59> after I save everything manually on old pc
[23:55:30] <biapy> Guest59, not so sure...
[23:55:52] <ducasse> if the disk is shot, it's shot
[23:56:06] <Guest59> yeah well it does not seem shot on old laptop
[23:56:17] <ducasse> check the logs
[23:57:31] <leftyfb> ducasse: I told them to check dmesg 3 times several hour ago. Nothing but refusal

[23:58:27] *** MrChristmas is now known as MrC
[23:58:51] <Guest59> I checked dmesg and it's almost clear
[23:59:35] <Guest59> I am still thinking the drive will work after format
[23:59:38] <Guest59> it usually does
[23:59:50] <Guest59> it has not been moved physically at all
