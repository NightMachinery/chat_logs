[14:21:01] <wasamasa> I kind of expected that
[14:21:42] <bremner> aye
[14:22:21] <wasamasa> so github.com/emacs-circe move I guess
[14:22:38] <wasamasa> then add ecraven and other contributors to the team
[14:23:06] <bremner> :thumbs-up-emoji:
[14:23:59] <ecraven> :-/ what has he moved on to from Emacs?
[14:25:56] <wasamasa> my bet is vs code
[14:26:15] <wasamasa> I met forcer once in hamburg and he mentioned working lots with go
[14:26:28] <ecraven> well, all the best to him, and thanks for all his great work, but still sad to see him go :-/
[14:26:54] <ecraven> I've never met him, but talked a bit about Scheme and Emacs on IRC, a decade or two ago
[14:27:10] <wasamasa> currently he's doing some JS here and there
[14:27:13] <wasamasa> on github at least

[21:09:40] <jgkamat> that's unfortunate, but yeah, kind of expected :(
