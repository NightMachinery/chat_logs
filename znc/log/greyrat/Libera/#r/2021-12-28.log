[21:03:44] <eliocamp1> I hate LaTeX with a passion and I hate that so many people in the FOSS like it and want to sing its praises. It's terrible, it's ugly code, it's a frustrating workflow. The only redeeming quality is that the end result is (sometimes) pretty. 
[21:03:49] *** eliocamp1 is now known as eliocamp
[21:05:32] <Bayes> latex is ok, sure it has many quirks and it does feel old as shit but it's ok afterall
[21:05:39] <Bayes> there's nothing better out there unfortunately
[21:07:55] <eliocamp> Yeah, that's kind of my issue. That the best we got is this thing that is ugly as hell and involves nonsense stuff like "render the pdf twice, then run bibtex and then render again". 
[21:09:59] <Bayes> heh
[21:12:20] <Bayes> can't remember the name but there's a tool for that
[21:12:35] <Bayes> you're not supposed to run pdflatex pdflatex bibtex pdflatex by hand
[21:13:06] <Bayes> there's mktex or something that takes care of the whole cycle
[21:13:43] <Bayes> since I switched to AuCTeX, or simply emacs built-in latex, latex became a great experience
[21:13:49] <eliocamp> Yeah, I know,. You have like two dozen variations of latex, which is also not great since they are not always intercompatible. 
[21:14:03] <Bayes> it basically took away like 90% of the burdensome part
[21:14:20] <Bayes> yeah also that
[21:14:28] <eliocamp> In TexMaker there's a button to do that, but it's not even the default so you basically need to actively learn about that. 
[21:14:51] <Bayes> incidentally, since I switched to luatex it's also faster and has better error messages
[21:15:10] <eliocamp> The user shouldn't need to see that awful little secret. It should be as hidden as possible and Just Work. 
[21:15:10] <Bayes> with emacs you simply do C-c C-a and voila :P
[21:15:37] <Bayes> no thanks:P Â that's how we came up with windows and the tidyverse
[21:15:41] <eliocamp> Right, you now need to learn yer another semi-obscure tool.
[21:16:02] <Bayes> I sure wish latex was a bit more modern and had better compatibility and all that
[21:16:15] <eliocamp> Exactly. Software that works and, for all its failings, helps people be productive. 
[21:18:07] <eliocamp> In any case, though, I'm basically saying that it should be like what you use, that the editor does it all by itself. 
[21:29:16] <Bayes> couldn't agree more

[21:52:20] <Bayes> gah
[21:52:38] <Bayes> I have 280 observations that can be quickly summarized in a two way table
[21:53:04] <Bayes> and I'm just going in circles to account for "variability" between cells

[21:53:46] <rickyrick> wat
[21:53:55] <rickyrick> How big a two-way table
[21:54:29] <eliocamp> When in doubt, use all of them and chose the one with p < 0.05
[21:54:40] <rickyrick> lmao
[21:54:43] <Bayes> 7 cols, 5 rows, 8 obs per each row x col
[21:55:03] <rickyrick> Declare a negative result :^)
