[15:10:38] <KatrinValerie> Or maybe directly call the demiurge
[15:10:58] <amigojapan> !c demiurge
[15:10:59] <ImoutoBot> amigojapan: In the Platonic, Neopythagorean, Middle Platonic, and Neoplatonic schools of philosophy, the demiurge is an artisan-like figure responsible for fashioning and maintaining the physical universe. The Gnostics adopted the term demiurge.

[15:26:58] <Sadale> You can't win a political argument with Chinese users. And if you keep replying thing would get escalated. And politic discussions is out of the scope of an anime channel :P
[15:27:21] <lastonestanding> do people in HK have points too now?

[15:27:36] <lastonestanding> why not?
[15:27:39] <snake> lastonestanding, the social credit system is mostly to help enforce regulations, they apply to businesses

[15:29:36] <lastonestanding> china has its own internet though
[15:29:40] <Sadale> I'm correct and I'm the truth. You're wrong
[15:30:15] <Sadale> not exactly. China's internet is connected to the world. It just has a strict firewall for all external connections.
[15:30:20] <lastonestanding> can a chinese man open google.com ?
[15:30:25] <Sadale> North Korea has its own intranet. So is Iran.
[15:30:39] <Sadale> lastonestanding, not without bypassing the firewall.
[15:30:43] <snake> seems i never saved the article about social credit system
[15:30:50] <snake> being mundane regulatory things
[15:30:51] <KatrinValerie> Space has 11 dimensions
[15:31:10] <lastonestanding> isn't space only 3?
[15:31:10] <KatrinValerie> or it makes for neat mathematical models to assume that, sometimes.
[15:31:13] <lastonestanding> or 3+1?
[15:31:21] <snake> i did save "What to tell parents whose child saw them having sex" LOL
[15:31:22] <KatrinValerie> lastonestanding: m-theory stuff
[15:31:25] <Sadale> space has 69 dimensions
[15:31:52] <lastonestanding> is there more space than universe?
[15:31:59] <KatrinValerie> Maybe space really has an arbitary number of dimensions and it assumes whatever number that we do not assume
[15:32:23] <KatrinValerie> lastonestanding: probably not
[15:32:45] <HubertFarnsworth> amigojapan: so is the pizza salty?
[15:32:49] <lastonestanding> then how does the universe expand?
[15:33:15] <lastonestanding> there has to be space outside the universe
[15:33:32] <HubertFarnsworth> yes, there is
[15:33:48] <HubertFarnsworth> there is more than one universe
[15:33:57] <HubertFarnsworth> it isn't like closed box
[15:34:01] <snake> nah there is only one universe
[15:34:05] <snake> and it's a close system
[15:34:09] <snake> closed
[15:34:13] <lastonestanding> it has to be closed
[15:34:14] <lastonestanding> yes
[15:34:36] <snake> lastonestanding, i think its like a baloon, expanding with more air
[15:34:55] <snake> except what is the air for the universe? perhaps that is outside the realm of science
[15:35:04] <KatrinValerie> It's wonky geometry really

[15:40:07] <snake> i dont know enough about it
[15:40:45] <Sadale> Basically there's a one-China policy. Now both PRC and ROC claims that there's just one China with both claiming that they own the mainland plus the Taiwan island.
[15:40:50] <amigojapan> snake: Taiwan has native languages from before the Chinese arrived
[15:41:06] <Sadale> At least that's how it is de jure.

[20:14:59] <Bco1981> The 12VHPWR power connector consists of 16 pins in total, four more than Nvidia's 12-pin PCIe power connector.
[20:15:11] <Bco1981> The 12VHPWR power connector is reportedly built for PCIe 5.0 graphics cards and isn't backwards compatible with previous generations graphics cards.
[20:15:28] <MootPoot> wym backwards compatible
[20:15:31] <MootPoot> its a power connector
[20:15:33] <MootPoot> use an adapter
[20:15:44] <Bco1981> so... is our current psu forwards compatible ?
[20:15:53] <MootPoot> its just molex
[20:15:58] <MootPoot> enough adapters
[20:16:01] <MootPoot> :P
[20:16:15] <MootPoot> unless we switch to ATX 12VO
[20:16:24] <Bco1981> According to the technical drawings, the 12VHPWR power connector doesn't adhere to the MicroFit Molex standard. The power pins are 3mm apart whereas the pitch on the existing 6-pin and 8-pin PCIe connectors is 4.2mm. It's 18.85mm long so it isn't exactly a small connector.

[20:17:44] <Bco1981> okay so it sounds like it's possible.
[20:17:45] <Bco1981> The introduction of the 12VHPWR power connectors will be troublesome for power supply manufacturers. They'll either have to design new products that comes with the 12VHPWR power connector or provide existing owners with an adaptor.
[20:18:38] <MootPoot> I doubt its going to happen
[20:18:53] <MootPoot> Nvidia will provide it maybe with their founders and an adapter
[20:19:03] <MootPoot> AIBs will just use the current standard
[20:19:11] <MootPoot> its like ATX 12VO
[20:19:14] <Bco1981> good luck getting one of those.
[20:19:34] <MootPoot> its cool in theory but the problem is your asking the mobo makers to do more for not much benefit for them
[20:19:36] <MootPoot> so why bother
[20:20:06] <MootPoot> Bco1981: just makes my point even more solid, if the founders are so rare, we're going to just stick to 8pin molex
[20:20:08] <MootPoot> which is fine tbh
