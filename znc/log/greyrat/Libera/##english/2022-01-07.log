[01:29:49] <michigan> While "English" includes them all?
[01:30:00] <blkshp> no it's the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. England, Wales and Scotland are British
[01:30:14] <blkshp> English includes only people from England.
[01:30:24] <michigan> Ah ok, cool.
[01:30:27] <blkshp> Do not call someone Scottish for example English, they do not appreciate it!
[01:30:57] <michigan> A bit confused, my Welsh friend talks about the British like they're separate people.
[01:31:04] <michigan> haha
[01:31:12] <blkshp> I understand but he's wrong.
[01:31:26] <blkshp> He is British whether it's acknowledged or not.
[01:31:32] <michigan> :D
[01:31:41] <blkshp> But if he doesn't want to be called British he is still Welsh
[01:31:56] <blkshp> I am English British.
[01:32:06] <blkshp> So I can still be called English.
[01:32:11] <michigan> I was about to ask.
[01:33:12] <michigan> Did I share his opinions? He was joking ofcourse - I found it very funny.

[01:44:19] <silverdust> What have everyone's decision to wear red do to my decision? Is there a word/phrase? Is there some concept of this that I can read more of on Wikipedia?

[02:26:15] <Nobrem> May I please inquire as to whether or not the following question is considered correct?
[02:26:24] <Nobrem> "How to learn English quick"
[02:26:50] <Nobrem> The full sentence was: "In this video you'll find out how to learn English quick"
[02:27:14] <Nobrem> shouldn't it be "quickly" rather than "quick" as it describes how something is done rather than how something is?
[02:29:18] <acdw> Yes, but "quick" is fine for conversational usage, IMO.
[02:30:00] <Nobrem> If I were to use this sentence myself (for whatever reason) and I said "quickly",  would it be considered wrong?

[10:12:55] <Me-me> The "best" way to learn grammar is a bit misleading, since most people learn most of their grammar by exposure. There are more formal methods of learning, like English language classes or educational texts, but they won't give you all the social and cultural context for the uses of these things, so even that which is technically correct can sound out of place.
[10:13:59] <pingpongball> :| yes right

[12:20:27] <amigojapan> Why does English really need question marks, for me it is clear when it is a question because of the reversal of the verb and the subject. Why don't we stop using them?
[12:20:38] <amigojapan> It seems redundant
[12:21:16] <Me-me> These days, question marks are more about intonation.
[12:22:00] <amigojapan> I see
[12:22:43] <Me-me> Not that it's technically correct, but you might see someone say, "What." In frustrated incredulity to something, as opposed to, say, "Hey, Jessica?" When that's not a question. It's about the upward intonation at the end of the sentence.

[12:58:00] <GuiToris> hello, is 'silly' offensive?
[12:59:05] <Me-me> Depends entirely on context.
[12:59:22] <Me-me> It's not really inherent in the language - but then, most offensive words aren't.
[13:00:10] <GuiToris> I'm about to say I'm surprised because I thought you were a silly little girl
[13:00:11] <Me-me> Retard, for example, is a verb describing the dramatic reduction or lack of growth. Like flame retardant. But it's also offensive in most situations as a result of its (entirely technically accurate) use in the now deprecated term, mental retardation.
[13:00:29] <GuiToris> or what should I used in place of silly
[13:00:33] <GuiToris> I guess not retard :D
[13:01:01] <GuiToris> is there an even lighter word?
[13:01:02] <Me-me> Wwwwellll... I can envision situations where calling someone a "silly little girl" isn't offensive ... but they're few and far between. Mostly to do with intimate friendship with that person.
[13:01:17] <Me-me> Can you give a bit more context than that? Why are you calling this person a silly little girl?
[13:02:11] <GuiToris> she showed me pictures of herself where she wasn't so serious on them, like sticking out her tongue, etc
[13:02:49] <GuiToris> but I wouldn't like to refer in any way to her intelligence
[13:05:38] <GuiToris> ok, the dictionary offers these: loony, dippy, dopy, bonkers, cracked, screwball, wachy, nutty, kookie, kook, loco, flaky, fruitcake, charlie, dingbat, goofball
[13:05:51] <GuiToris> is any of them better than silly?
[13:06:55] <Me-me> Um.
[13:07:21] <Me-me> I'm going to keep asking for context, here. Are you flirting with this girl?
[13:07:41] <Me-me> Because "silly" is not the most notable descriptor, to my mind.
[13:09:04] <GuiToris> hmmm, I don't know :/ I'm teetering tottering, I would say yes, but sometimes I change my mind
[13:09:32] <GuiToris> I'm saying yes now

[13:11:15] <brigand> "Little" is more offending if she is his age anyway.
[13:11:44] <Me-me> GuiToris: "Silly" is not the potential dealbreaker, here. "Little girl" is something called a diminutive. And that's what might be a problem, here.
[13:11:56] <GuiToris> ohh... ohhh
[13:11:56] <brigand> Yeah.
[13:12:03] <GuiToris> she's 30
[13:12:42] <GuiToris> she just sent me more serious pictures, and I'm afraid that she will notice a crack in my 'tone'
[13:12:43] <Me-me> Still dependent on context. Some people would find it funny, others wouldn't think anything of it. But there's a significant chance that it would be considered offensive.

[13:18:34] <Me-me> Happy to help.
[13:19:15] <Me-me> And for what it's worth, I recommend committing to the flirting part. Harder to recontextualise a relationship as romantic than to (gently) back out of a romantic relationship.
[13:19:50] <brigand> Do you always want to tiptoe around her?
[13:20:34] <Me-me> brigand: The counterpoint is that she would always have to put effort into interpreting him. There's always compromise, you just set the starting position. Hence my previous assertion.

[13:37:04] <Me-me> brigand: "Women don't", even appended by "usually", is a fallacious statement in almost all contexts. You happened not to choose one of those contexts.
[13:38:10] <Me-me> You chose a context, being their preferences for romance, that is, in fact, decidedly not to do with gender dimorphism. It was a small, ugly thing, what you said, and I spat upon it. Do I need to go on, or is your reading comprehension up to snuff?
