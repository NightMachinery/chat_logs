[12:26:51] <hendry> I made a couple of bad commits, can I create a branch from HEAD^2 and then swap that with main, so that i can cherry pick from the two bad commits what I need? Is that a good strategy?
[12:28:14] *** Quits: otisolsen70_ (~otisolsen@xd4ed80b5.cust.hiper.dk) (Quit: Leaving)
[12:28:31] <Nei> yes
[12:28:43] <Nei> for example you can do: git checkout -b b0rked-code
[12:28:52] <Nei> git reset --hard HEAD~2
[12:28:55] <hendry> how do i do that? most resources online seem to want to replace main with what's in the branch
[12:28:56] <Nei> something like that
[12:29:11] <hendry> Nei: ah ok, thanks
[12:29:17] <Nei> or you can git checkout HEAD~2, then git checkout -b head-before-2
[12:29:41] <Nei> there are too many ways ^^

[14:21:01] <jokoon> is it possible to remove a commit remotely and to keep it locally?
[14:21:44] <jokoon> I need to make a PR without a certain commit
[14:21:52] <Nei> yes and no :) you can force-push to a remote, but you cannot be sure if the commit will be gone
[14:22:05] <Nei> if you've never put the commit on remote then you can also do  it
[14:22:23] <Nei> you would first make a new branch without that commit, then push that branch to remote
[14:22:30] <jokoon> I guess I could just just branch from a previous commit and PR that new branch
[14:22:44] <Nei> you cannot just skip a commit though, all the following commits will have different hashes
[14:22:50] <jokoon> Im using git bash and tortoise git
[14:23:06] <Nei> yes, branch from a previous commit, sounds exactly right
[14:23:36] <jokoon> How would I do it with tortoise git?
[14:24:04] <Nei> that I don't know. but in bash, you can "git checkout previoushash"
[14:24:10] <Nei> then git checkout -b newbranch

[19:20:06] <SpeakerToMeat> Hi all.
[19:20:38] <SpeakerToMeat> Question, if I branched, from a commit, and never pushed anything to that branch, and I want to start the branch from a commit further down the road, what's best, I delete the branch and create again?
[19:20:47] <bookworm> hoppity: status only uses local information, you need to git fetch first to sync up with a remote
[19:20:48] <SpeakerToMeat> Or is there a way to sanely "rebase" the branch start point
[19:21:08] <bookworm> SpeakerToMeat: just reset it
[19:21:17] <hoppity> bookworm: thank you
[19:21:42] <bookworm> git reset --hard $whatever SpeakerToMeat
[19:22:05] <bookworm> if it's all linear, merge works as well
[19:22:12] <SpeakerToMeat> bookworm, so, checkout the branch, and reset (hard) to the hash of the commit I want to start from?
[19:22:19] <bookworm> yes
[19:22:39] <bookworm> note that --hard can loose work, you've been warned

[19:24:09] <SpeakerToMeat> I just checked out, and there has been no edits, nothing to stash, etc

[22:33:10] <sudomann> I added a branch to track a remoteB/foo-channel. I then moved files around (all local changes) and wanted to merge these changes into another branch, but they all show as delete/add changes
[22:33:41] <sudomann> We're trying to move a whole repo into a folder inside another repo and preserve history
[22:36:37] <OnlineCop> Whenever you add/remove files, it will show two entries for each: one delete, and one add. I believe there's a "recognize move" flag (-m or -M maybe? I'll have to look it up), but that usually preserves the file history.
[22:37:12] <texasmynsted> Showing your move as delete/add looks exactly like what you did.
[22:38:05] <texasmynsted> The second sentence looks incompatible with what you did.
[22:38:52] <texasmynsted> but maybe it is just a step in your process
[22:39:13] <OnlineCop> I'll have to review `git help mv` again. It's been a long day.
[22:41:32] <texasmynsted> You should be able to look at the history and see the move. It should look like what you want.
[22:42:26] <texasmynsted> you could always try the move with --dry-run and --verbose to see what happens

[23:48:39] <texasmynsted> I mean they remove data that should not have been in the repo
[23:48:53] <texasmynsted> It is not simply removing files or key value pairs.
[23:49:25] <j416> but that data exists in their parent commits, and you are fine with this?
[23:49:32] <texasmynsted> yes
[23:49:45] <texasmynsted> it will need to be removed from all history

[23:50:16] <texasmynsted> oh sorry
[23:50:34] <j416> it's ok that the parent commits have the data, but it's not ok so you want to remove it?
[23:51:04] <texasmynsted> I mean to say that the data must be removed from all commits that remain in the repo
[23:51:24] <j416> ok. and what is the reason that you are moving these commits?
[23:52:01] <texasmynsted> the problem is that the main branch merges with the develop branch long before the commits that clean the repo. Right now the cleaning commits exist only on develop.

[23:54:00] <texasmynsted> my plan is to break everything necessary to rewrite history as needed and create a new repo
