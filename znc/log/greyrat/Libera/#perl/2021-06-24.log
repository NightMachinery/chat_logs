[00:12:44] <mjgardner> If I do something like `*foo = \&bar;`, is there any way in `bar` that I can tell I was actually called with `foo`? `(caller 0)[3]` seems to always contain `main::bar`.
[00:13:59] <Grinnz> no
[00:14:18] <Grinnz> that assignment is an alias - they are the same subroutine
[00:14:47] <mjgardner> Is there a better way than doing that assignment that will tell me which I was called as?
[00:15:07] <Grinnz> only by making it a wrapper, which will introduce another stack frame
[00:15:23] <Grinnz> sub foo { bar @_ }
[00:15:56] <Grinnz> i suspect there's a better option depending what your end goal is

[00:16:43] <nirnam> found dead in prison cell after Spanish court approved the extradition
[00:18:10] <mjgardner> Grinnz: The end goal is that I have a private subroutine _foo that I want to now make public foo, and I want to warn that calling it as _foo is deprecated.
[00:18:10] <Grinnz> mjgardner: for example, if you just want the subroutine to act differently when called a different way, a common mechanism is to write a wrapper which uses local to locally set some (private) state while the subroutine runs
[00:18:32] <Grinnz> ah, so yes just make _foo a wrapper which does the deprecation warning then calls foo
[00:18:54] <simcop2387> maybe doing a replacement after the first warning too
[00:19:46] <Grinnz> you can write it like: sub _foo { warn 'deprecated blah blah; goto &foo; } to remove the extra stack frame
[00:20:10] <Grinnz> it's slower than a normal wrapper, but since it's deprecated i doubt that's a concern
[00:20:32] <Grinnz> (don't worry, that's not a real goto)

[12:09:20] <tm604> The_Blode: if you're using asynchronous code, then yes - what are the remaining steps in the function that should happen later?
[12:09:29] <tm604> or can you pastebin an example of what you have already?
[12:10:01] <The_Blode> I can't really paste the code since it's my work code.
[12:10:22] <The_Blode> However, what I'm doing is, I am playing a sound and I want to also fire off a cURL command.
[12:10:35] <The_Blode> and I want the cURL command to process while my sound is playing
[12:10:42] <The_Blode> I have thought of doing a while loop
[12:12:22] <tm604> okay, that's a good starting point - how are you playing the sound, is that with system() to run an external command?
[12:13:01] <The_Blode> Actually, I'm using AGI Perl Module which interfaces with Asterisk
[12:13:06] <The_Blode> A method called Stream File
[12:14:17] <The_Blode> Also, side note, I would like to check if a file is being accessed or not. Currently, I'm using Linux lsof...but wondering if Perl has something native?
[12:14:27] <The_Blode> So I can use this to determine if a file has finished playing or not.
[12:17:25] <tm604> does the stream file method return when the file has finished playing? or does it return immediately?
[12:18:11] <The_Blode> I'm not sure. That was another head scratcher. The module document tells me the method returns a value.
[12:18:23] <The_Blode> But I'm not sure how to store that return.
[12:18:50] <The_Blode> I'm using something like $return = $AGI->stream_file...but it doesn't help me.
[12:19:03] <tm604> you can run curl in the background - see perldoc perlopentut or perldoc perlipc for details, https://perldoc.perl.org/perlopentut#Opening-a-pipe-for-reading
[12:19:04] <Paperbot> Link title(s): [ perlopentut - simple recipes for opening files and pipes in Perl - Perldoc Browser ]
[12:19:26] <The_Blode> Running cURL in the background would be an amazing thing
[12:19:27] <tm604> maybe start by logging the value of `$return`, see when that happens?
[12:19:42] <The_Blode> I have done that and it returns 0 which is expected
[12:19:57] <tm604> background is basically: open my $curl_fh, '-|', qw(curl https://whatever) or die "curl failed - $!";
[12:20:12] <tm604> the value of the return is less important than *when* it returns, I think
[12:20:12] <The_Blode> I'm actually using backtricks for my cURL command
[12:20:17] <The_Blode> Wasn't sure of the native Perl support
[12:20:27] <tm604> backticks will wait for it to complete, unless you add the &
[12:20:59] <tm604> but with open(), you can run as a subprocess in the background and if your script is stopped it'll cause SIGHUP on the curl process so that should stop it, rather than leaving it running in the background
[12:21:27] <The_Blode> Is cURL a seperate module or is it built in to Perl?
[12:21:47] <The_Blode> I mean the methods for it
[12:21:57] <The_Blode> Maybe it's on CPAN let me see

[12:23:59] <The_Blode> Yep
[12:24:10] <tm604> Perl does have HTTP clients, but they might not be a good fit for an Asterisk plugin
[12:25:09] <The_Blode> Thank you so much for your help. Still learning about Perl

[12:27:29] <The_Blode> I actually prefer Perl over Python personally. Unpopular opinion but Perl seems to be able to do whatever Python can.
[12:27:41] <The_Blode> And I like a bit of structure that Perl offers.
[12:27:53] <The_Blode> Curly braces and brackets. That sort of thing.
[12:28:37] <The_Blode> Also, my mind was blown the other day when I decode my first Base64 string
[12:28:47] <tm604> Yes, python is widely used and tends to have up-to-date libraries for more things than Perl, but each language has its own strengths and weaknesses
[12:28:51] <The_Blode> How could this massive text dump turn into a binary file...astonishing to me
[12:29:27] <The_Blode> For Perl, I use it to parse HTML and it's superb at it. I believe Perl was the first language to use Regular Expressions that we all use today in other langs.
[12:29:30] <The_Blode> I could be wrong though.
[12:29:38] <The_Blode> Larry Wall did a remarkable thing.

[17:36:24] <leitz> genio, that sounds like good advice. There are a lot of things I need to figure out, along with my module.  :)

[18:35:33] <simcop2387> rindolf: morning, we haven't fully figured out what we want to do regarding #perlcafe vs ##perlcafe but you're welcome in either and i've set you up with the ability to op in ##perlcafe since it's registered.  I've proposed we register a community here for #perlcafe as a perl mongers group so that we can properly register it and get everyone moved to one channel or the other again
[18:36:35] <simcop2387> Altreus: just the ability to force myself to use perl critic and such during the author testing/minting of the dist makes a big difference for my own sanity/quality

[18:42:04] <simcop2387> rindolf: ah that would probably be good to put in the whole thing if we send it off.  but my main reason was to ask if you wanted to be part of what libera calls the "group contact" for the community, that'd basically give you the ability to get cloaks for people that'd look like @about/perlcafe/<user> and help register any #perlcafe-* channels but i don't see any channel registrations ever

[18:47:37] <pragma-> you can just freely add other #perl-xyz channels too.

[18:50:08] <pragma-> In any case, I think most of the current ex-freenode staff think the # vs ## channel namespacing thing was a mistake. They've reverted it here, and the new freenode has also removed that policy. I'd go with #perlcafe over ##perlcafe going forward.
[18:50:27] <Altreus> I like perlcade more - it sounds like we have games
[18:52:14] <simcop2387> Altreus: i'll probably setup something like that when i finish rewriting the core part of perlbot.  my whole purpose in doing so is going to be to get rid of the parts that i can't get anyone to claim ownership of and give me a license i can distribute it under, but also allow perlbot to fully control a channel and do more advanced plugins for things like zork, battleship, warewolf, uno, and many

[18:52:26] <pragma-> Actually, I am not 100% clear on what libera's policy for # and ## is. I recall they made the rules more lax, but maybe they didn't completely revert it as I originally claimed.

[18:53:52] <simcop2387> pragma-: it's not completely reverted no, basically they made it easier for someone to claim one without a ## by making things like communities part of the policy.  before it was *ONLY* projects/official channels.  now groups like the people talking about regular expressions can get #regex without requiring an exception or being grandfathered in.
[18:54:05] <pragma-> Yeah, they still use ## for informal channels, but you no longer need to have an official representative of a community or project to register # channels.

[21:36:39] <leitz> thrig; yeah, SunOS 2.4, 2.5, Solaris 6, IIRC.
[21:37:28] <nirnam> leitz: ricardo signes said jokingly in perl conference 2016 that they gonna keep removing stuff until perl become python with sigils
[21:37:31] <nirnam> it gonna be amazing
[21:37:42] <mjgardner> as far as I know Perl 7 is still going to be a thing, and it will be safe to have it as /usr/bin/perl. Past that I don't think anything specific has been determined.
[21:37:46] <leitz> ether, if I understand, the perl core maintainers have to spend a lot of energy maintaining very historical code. If Perl 7 allowed Perl 5 to continue for those that need it, it might help the core team.
[21:37:54] <thrig> nirnam: how would they slow it down, though?

[23:07:46] <leitz> The perlhack page has me doing a "./Configure ...", and then "make test", with no "make" inbetween. Is that correct?
[23:07:51] <leitz> The tests are running...
[23:09:36] <thrig> presumably the Makefile was written so that "make test" depends on "make"
[23:10:06] <Grinnz> as you're just adjusting docs, you actually only need `make test_porting`
[23:10:08] <leitz> makes sense.  :)
[23:11:04] <leitz> Grinnz, likely so. But at the same time, this makes sure my box is set up for building.
[23:13:01] <leitz> I want to move to an RPi as a desktop, and being able to compile is one of the things I need to do. Well, I'm currently on a third hand Dell, I think the RPi will be faster... 
[23:19:53] *** Joins: furrymcgee (~devuan@31.179.186.66)
[23:30:57] <zgu> which generation pi?
[23:33:20] <pragma-> seems a bit redundant to show youtube api metadata and also youtube url titles for the same youtube link
[23:34:26] <Grinnz> I have to rearchitecture a bit to fix that, the plugins currently have no idea they're both responding to it
[23:34:35] <pragma-> fun stuff
[23:35:10] *** Quits: Vicissitude (~Vicissitu@user/vicissitude) (Quit: Leaving)
[23:36:18] <zgu> the best is when the title has a keyword that trigger a command in another bot
[23:36:22] <pragma-> (probably want to disable the redirects for youtu.be too)
[23:36:45] <Grinnz> nah, that's intentional
[23:36:56] <pragma-> i know the redirects are intention, but even for youtu.be?
[23:37:00] <pragma-> seems unnecessary
[23:37:09] <mjgardner> They're giving me double embeds in IRCCloud.
[23:37:10] <Grinnz> not really necessary, but consistent
[23:37:15] <leitz> zgu, 4B. 
[23:37:16] * pragma- nods
[23:37:24] <Grinnz> anyway, once i fix the double responding thing, that won't be a part of youtube responses anyway
[23:37:43] <pragma-> probably going to eventually want to be able to ignore certain redirects since they'll just be redundant (like youtu.be)
[23:37:46] * pragma- shrugs
[23:38:25] <leitz> Uh, not too much hubris to add myself to AUTHORS so   t/porting/pending-author.t   passes?
[23:38:46] <Grinnz> leitz: nope, that's expected - the committer can also do it for you if you want
[23:39:46] <leitz> Grinnz, I'd have to grump at myself if I gave them something with a failing test. I grump at everyone else who does it.

[23:40:26] <Grinnz> sure, but the authors test isn't really the responsibility of individual committers (though many have been happy to fix it themselves)

[23:47:42] <Zhmylove[m]> Hi all
[23:48:05] <leitz> Anyone up for critiquing my first Perl PR?    https://github.com/LeamHall/perl5/commit/1dc0244f2bf4878474bb5805993759edcc9324ea
[23:48:06] <Paperbot> Link title(s): [ Modifications to perlnewmod.pod · LeamHall/perl5@1dc0244 · GitHub ]
[23:50:42] <Grinnz> leitz: 1. make your commit message something like 'perlnewmod - general description of the changes'
[23:51:05] <Grinnz> 2. the C<> as its own paragraph would be better as a verbatim block (remove the C<>, and indent the line)
[23:51:29] <Grinnz> might even be better as multiple lines

[23:55:46] <leitz> Grinnz, at the point the builder is there, the one-line version makes sense. Presumably they've actually done some testing prior, this is just a quick set of commands to build the tarball.
[23:56:18] <Grinnz> sure
[23:56:25] <Grinnz> what i would do though, is replace the ; with &&
[23:56:31] <alh> For the commit message, something like: perlnewmod: Remove dead URL and reword a step for consistency / clarity
[23:56:33] <Grinnz> so that e.g. failed tests stop the process
[23:56:39] <alh> It should give you an idea of what's changed, and more importantly - why
[23:57:13] <leitz> alh, what about:  Remove dead link and make a header line stand out more.
[23:57:49] <leitz> the C<> line doesn't look like a header, when you read the file.
[23:58:40] <alh> It does if you read it with perldoc (to me, anyway)
[23:59:02] <alh> But I agree it doesn't really line up with the way that file is written so changing it seems good
