[01:39:23] <kuhilas> http://sprunge.us/bwli9B
[01:40:53] <kuhilas> I have that libreddit.js in greasemonkey directory. Now if I try go to www.reddit.com/r/news it redirects to www.libredd.it/r/news which doesn't work since libredd.it has not configured www sub-domain. Also even if I go to https://reddit.com/r/news it will redirect to https://www.libredd.it/r/news which doesn't work. I guess the problem is in that script
[01:49:44] <nimaje> well, it should work if it just propperly sets  window.location.host  is there a reason why it uses  .replace(  instead? some places where the subdomain matters? 
[01:54:34] <kuhilas> not sure, I haven't made the script, I changed the last line now to location.href=location.host("libredd.it");  but now it doesn't redirect at all
[01:55:28] <kuhilas> location.host=location.host("libredd.it");  <- now changed to this but still
[01:59:51] <Earnestly> kuhilas: E.g. https://0x0.st/ozQA.bin (my rewrite.py) with config.source(config.configdir / 'rewrite.py') in config.py
[02:00:03] <Earnestly> Can do this using interceptor api
[02:02:31] <kuhilas> that looks a lot like the code I have commented out in my config.py which sometimes crashed my browser
[02:03:04] <kuhilas> I wouldn't want to switch back and forth. This I have had works fine, but since teddit.net is laggy I want to try libredd.it, they just don't have www subdomain
[02:04:08] <kuhilas> but thanks anyway
[02:05:30] <kuhilas> nimaje: trying to find how to set location.host but can't get good search results https://duckduckgo.com/?q=how+to+set+location.host()+python&ia=web
[02:05:42] <kuhilas> oh wait, it's js
[02:08:31] <Earnestly> sigh
[02:08:47] <kuhilas> ok found and it works now. I wonder if I used that interceptor API would it redirect at an earlier phase because now it is as if it starts to load reddit.com and then redirects
[02:09:31] <kuhilas> somehow I felt the redirect was faster or earlier earlier, maybe it was when I was using that interceptor

[12:12:03] <The-Compiler> Guest539: if I do "qutebrowser --temp-basedir https://192.168.1.73" I get Chromium's error page, and I would assume you get too

[12:14:43] <Guest539> I don't remember getting annoyed by error page until recentlyÂ =D
[12:15:06] <Guest539> maybe beacuse I'm using qutebrowser from debian repo
[12:18:13] <The-Compiler> maybe you got the same error pages but without the broken URL, if you used to run an ancient Qt before
[12:18:22] <The-Compiler> like, on Debian oldstable or something
[12:19:09] <Guest539> No, I distinctly remember getting a different type of error page, and I'm using debian testing
[12:19:37] <The-Compiler> so what about --temp-basedir?
[12:20:11] <Guest539> Yes I get the same type of "chromium error page"
[12:20:42] <Guest539> I used to get this type of pages: https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8147434/46190551-4ded3480-c2f4-11e8-9443-146b4c9ab406.png
[12:20:45] <The-Compiler> see, so there must be something in your setup causing that to not be possible
[12:20:58] <The-Compiler> are you sure you don't have JS turned off?
[12:22:58] <Guest539> I don't remember changing anything deliberately and yes I have js turned on.
[12:24:54] <The-Compiler> can you show your :config-diff?
[12:26:13] <The-Compiler> ah, right, Debian, hm
[12:26:38] <The-Compiler> maybe https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=882805 regressed or something
[12:27:28] <The-Compiler> but no, if that was the case, you would see it with --temp-basedir too
[12:28:54] <Guest539> here's my config-diff: https://paste.the-compiler.org/view/10986897
[12:30:45] <The-Compiler> hm, I'm out of ideas
[12:31:29] <The-Compiler> could you reproduce this once in your normal instance (ideally after a :restart) and once with --temp-basedir (where you get the Chromium error page), and do :report in both so I can take a look at the logs?

[12:59:35] <Guest539> The-Compiler: I've sent both versions of the report. Another thing (I don't know if it helps) is, the older error page shows just for a fraction of a second and then it's replaced by the chromium error page.
[13:00:03] <The-Compiler> Guest539: contrary to what you say, you seem to get the qutebrowser error page with --temp-basedir too, according to the logs?
[13:00:15] *** Quits: jnphilipp (~jnphilipp@gateway/tor-sasl/jnphilipp) (Client Quit)
[13:00:25] <The-Compiler> Guest539: also, if you say "replaced by the chromium error page", do you mean "the qutebrowser error page"?
[13:00:56] <Guest539> yes I'm sorry, I mean the qutebrowser error page
[13:01:23] <The-Compiler> well, that changes things
[13:02:43] <The-Compiler> Guest539: if you run https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser/master/scripts/testbrowser/testbrowser_webengine.py with https://192.168.1.73 as an argument, do you see a fully working Chromium error page, or a corrupt one?
[13:05:51] <Guest539> It shows a chromium error page, I don't know what a corrupt one would look like.
[13:06:16] <Guest539> But this is the type of error page I want
[13:06:59] <The-Compiler> Guest539: it would look something like https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?att=1;bug=882805;filename=2017-11-26-231109_638x430_scrot.png;msg=5
[13:07:30] <Guest539> No, I get a fully working chromium error page
[13:07:36] <The-Compiler> it sounds almost like something changed in Debian's packaging/patching of QtWebEngine which causes an old workaround in qutebrowser to trigger
[13:10:51] <The-Compiler> Guest539: if you don't mind messing with your qutebrowser installation for a second, could you edit /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/qutebrowser/browser/webengine/webenginetab.py and find the line starting with "missing_jst = ..." there, add a "log.webview.debug(html)" above it, and send another report with that?
[13:11:31] <Guest539> sure
[13:11:37] <The-Compiler> it's likely Debian-specific and I'd probably need to set up a VM first to track this down :-/

[23:55:59] <bdju> does anyone here use myanimelist.net? the "mark all as read" button in notifications doesn't seem to play well with hints. I type the letters that appear to be right by it, but it ends up clicking through to the search behind or something
[23:56:17] <bdju> I'm guessing it's just not getting hinted at all actually (the real button)
