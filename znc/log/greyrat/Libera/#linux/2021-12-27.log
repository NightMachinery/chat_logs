[01:38:49] <akk> SineDeviance: It might be interesting to run xev (from x11-utils) and type the key, and see if it shows XF86AudioRaiseVolume (and *Lower*)

[01:40:39] <SineDeviance> I guess the mixer is ignoring them
[01:41:02] <akk> SineDeviance: Detected as having that name, you mean? Just being detected as a key doesn't help if it's sending some other keysym.

[01:53:14] <kapaun> where the system prompts you, "which program should I open this type of thing with"
[01:53:31] <AsenMx> yeah, you have to find where your mimeapp list is located and clean it up i guess
[01:53:43] <kapaun> no...?
[01:53:46] <AsenMx> can't help you more than this sadly
[01:53:47] <kapaun> that won't get me what I want?
[01:54:16] <kapaun> is there any spec for implementing a program to handle links?

[01:54:30] <kapaun> if it doesn't exist I'd like to make one myself
[01:54:34] <SineDeviance> tm512: seems like plasma-pa is needed for them to work. I curiously did not have that package, but installing it has fixed the issue
[01:54:35] <SineDeviance> thanks!
[01:54:40] <AsenMx> well might be, in the mimeapps you keep the default app to open file type if it is empty for that file type it will open a prompt to let you select
[01:55:14] <kapaun> ok how do I reset this?
[01:55:17] <tirnanog> kapaun: the File Associations dialog under System Settings should have "Ask" as one of the configurable choices, thouhg it probably can't be set there other than on a per-mimetype basis.
[01:55:20] <tm512> SineDeviance: glad that helped. that was a shot in the dark, just googled "kde volume keys not working"

[01:59:23] <hexnewbie> kapaun: KDE has an Open With in the context menu that provides all available programs.
[01:59:35] <tm512> maybe there is some sort of "open with" application that you can set as the preferred application for every MIME type. I don't get what the big deal is though, like where this would even be exceptionally useful

[03:46:09] <bpmedley_> gebbione : Have you considered a pstree or similar output and find the parent trail?

[03:47:26] <Dr-007> ok
[03:47:50] <freeone3000> MrElendig: The server doesn't understand unix permissions; it's granted access via the CIFS ACL, so, it allows the CIFS User to read/write/modify/execute.
[03:47:56] <gebbione> bpmedley_, pstree with the process id shows -> sh???php [ that i guess could be anything, even a cron]
[03:48:05] <freeone3000> MrElendig: The problem is that permissions are too *loose*, not too strict.

[04:33:56] <Duchess> before asking here.
[04:34:14] <akk> Elw3: There's presumably something grub-related on the mbr that's pointing to one partition or the other, but I don't think it's the same as the grub.cfg.

[09:19:54] <ayecee> depends what the problem is
[09:19:55] <flimsypondreed> and you're getting stuck at the last part
[09:19:55] <node1> solution*
[09:20:26] <flimsypondreed> I had a computer that was unable to shut itself down and would get stuck at this waiting for watchdog thing, until I upgraded to latest kernel
[09:20:40] <ayecee> nice when that works
[09:20:50] <flimsypondreed> really is haha
[09:20:56] <joo-_> i got some ibm eservers, are there ways to check the health of the raid arrays inside the linux or will i need to shut down to find out , -and enter the raid bios ? :-)
[09:21:12] <ayecee> joo-_: that's a definite maybe
[09:21:26] <node1> Then let me upgrade my operating system.
[09:21:37] <Bocaneri> How are you determining that power from the battery is being drawn after shutdown, as opposed to the possibility that the battery isn't holding a charge?
[09:21:48] <flimsypondreed> it's a good low effort first try node1
[09:22:05] <ayecee> consistent with the low effort problem description
[09:22:19] <joo-_> ayecee: thats what i thought :D
[09:22:49] <node1> okay let me try to upgrade. And check if it works.
[09:22:54] <flimsypondreed> ayecee: my guess is getting stuck in POST, but the screen has been turned off so they can't see the log text
[09:23:30] <flimsypondreed> would explain the hard restart required to power on the laptop again
[09:23:41] <ayecee> joo-_: some types of array have a specific tool to use, from the manufacturer. do you know what kind of raid controller it is?
[09:24:02] <ayecee> flimsypondreed: reasonable theory, hard to test
[09:24:16] <ayecee> you'd see the power light on though
[09:25:02] <joo-_> ayecee: i will find out asap, i was just curious maybe there was a swiss armor knife of raid checking

[10:01:05] <Bocaneri> Nobody is worried. It's child's play to dump crap to a *terminal*. It's quite another to dump stuff to another *shell*. There's a big difference: the shell uses the terminal, but not vice-versa.
[10:01:11] <SudoBash> yea but on multiple systems I've tested so far, that does actually execute, but like ayecee says it just echos the output to their bash PID shell instead of executing, proven by id

[10:04:54] <jim> brentaarnold, are you using linux?

[10:04:59] <ayecee> you're correct, that goes to the shell's process, and 0 is stdin. to be honest, i've seen this before but i don't remember why it works this way.
[10:05:30] <SudoBash> so /proc/self/fd/0 is stdin? nothing else?

[10:20:07] <SudoBash> ok but if you're not running CGI or executing / using bash to execute anything through your web server, then how would you limit www-data so that it couldn't execute bash or ash/dash
[10:20:17] *** Quits: monoxane (~monoxane@user/monoxane) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[10:20:17] *** monoxane9 is now known as monoxane
[10:20:24] <ayecee> SudoBash: normal people wouldn't
[10:20:38] <AssKoala> having said that, ZFS sucks in its own ways.  For example, importing can break based on the device naming -- you may have perfectly good drives that wont import because it cant sort it out based on naming
[10:20:54] <brentaarnold> But I'm pretty sure that I'm going to be switching to something Linux/ESX because I don't want to continue the charade with Hyper-V, my customers are in areas too remote for VDI.
[10:20:54] <devslash> I "fixed the glitch" from earlier with the strangely named file
[10:21:03] <AssKoala> its not a "backup", ZFS/RAID/whatever is all about uptime/availability not an auto local backup
[10:21:21] <SudoBash> well, by what I've seen, you can pretty much reverse shell most web applications to some degree, which usually involves bash or /bin/sh (ash)
[10:21:23] <ayecee> SudoBash: even normal people who were very concerned about security wouldn't.
[10:21:35] <brentaarnold> AssKoala: I see
[10:22:19] <ayecee> SudoBash: what you've seen has mainly been toy problems.
[10:22:49] <SudoBash> aren't reverse shells a problem?
[10:22:53] <AssKoala> brentaarnold, I can't speak to what issues you're having with Hyper-V.  My home server runs Win11+Hyper-V with around 10 Linux VM's (and a FreeBSD one).  It's not a production environment but I wanted the host to run Plex with HW transcoding
[10:23:07] <ayecee> SudoBash: no. they're the result of a problem. they're not the problem.

[10:24:14] <SudoBash> you don't try to fix millions of problems when you could fix one
[10:24:47] <ayecee> this is not that one
[10:25:18] <ayecee> the one to fix is the one that let you start the reverse shell in the first place, because if you can start a shell, you can run any other program on the system.
[10:25:28] <brentaarnold> AssKoala: The issue is that M$ is going to be phasing out Hyper-V, they are no longer going to support or develop it come 2024, and they're now pushing Server Standard and Datacenter 2022 users to use what they call Azure HCI which is a hybrid stack. I don't need a hybrid stack.

[10:27:38] <SudoBash> brenaarnold that sounds impossible, but your best bet is probably proxmox / linux kvm?
[10:27:48] <AssKoala> brentaarnold, huh, first Ive seen that.  Doesnt really affect me, but I can see it being an issue with production systems to be forced to move to azure hci

[12:44:31] <vanessa> Sauvin, out of all 100s of tracking metadata, you only have managed to remove only one: geo-location.
[12:45:03] <jim> sumthing1980, you can make a dir in /var/www (say, called 'foo') and then mount something on /var/www/foo
[12:45:30] <tirnanog> Sandlayth: removing the backslashes and enclosing the parameter following -o with double quotes would eliminate the syntax error. there is an independent issue of potential code injection which you can potentially resolve by doing, say, `printf -v q_proxy_ip %q "$PROXY_IP"; printf -v q_proxy_port "$PROXY_PORT"` and, instead, expanding $q_proxy_ip and $q_proxy_port.
[12:45:39] <tirnanog> Sandlayth: that said, it's hard to render this strictly safe because 1) %q formatting is only useful if the shell into which the code is injected is known to be bash 2) you're dealing with at least three quoting layers here. so, the simplest approach is probably just to inject directly but perhaps test the values as to whether they're sane first.

[13:37:01] <sheep> the environment variables aren't standardized either, and it might be using something besides its "data directory" to detect other instances that are running so it can limit itself to one running instance

[16:03:59] <hexnewbie> I even had an issue where a subvolume decreased reliability, but it mostly had to do with ‘btrfs restore’ not seeing that subvolume
[16:04:25] <koollman> most fs won't like being anywhere close to 100% full. btrfs will be really really bad once it gets full enough
[16:04:42] <hexnewbie> But it had to do with some very ancient tools used to create it, so even that's not applicable in the here and now
[16:05:16] <hexnewbie> tar > any filesystem if you're going for 100% full (you can't randomly modify data in a tar, but neither can you in a 100% full FS, so might as well go tar)
[16:06:18] <koollman> I suppose cramfs and similar alternatives are better than tar, while being 100% 'full' (or rather, unable to modify data in them)
[16:06:28] <koollman> but it still seems like a bad design
[16:08:32] <Gaboradon> koollman: so btrfs needs some empty space for ... what? It's meant to be cold storage that I'll only power on once a month or so.

[16:10:35] <jjakob> there's too many filesystems to choose from
[16:11:11] <hexnewbie> There are also numerous other issues with being 100% full. The rapid fragmentation is probably not an issue if the backup is seldomly upgraded,but literally 100% full may be cause too much fragmentation even for that. The *bigger* issue is that being 100% full implies perfect planning.
[16:11:12] <koollman> https://xkcd.com/927/  s/standards/filesystems/  ;)
[16:11:15] <MrElendig> you don't want it to be 100% ful, try to stay under 90 on a spinner and 80 on ssd
[16:11:23] <Gaboradon> Well BTRFS is the one that has data robustness and FS metadata duplication, I've did some research in the weeks and it all looks better than NTFS/EXT4
[16:11:41] <jjakob> how does it compare to ZFS?
[16:11:46] <hexnewbie> For read-only data, you can get data robustness with par2
[16:11:55] <koollman> I don't think ntfs will crap itself when full. it has other weaknesses, but not that one
[16:12:00] <MrElendig> zfs is in teory more robust, but only if you have >1 disk
[16:12:14] <MrElendig> also requires a lot more ram etc
[16:12:29] <koollman> zfs will also work very slowly once it's close to full
[16:12:30] <Gaboradon> hexnewbie: par2 is files, but not the FS and it's metadata it self, so what's the point of using par2 on NTFS, if the NTFS it self gets corrupt
[16:12:34] <MrElendig> rule of thumbs is 1gb/tb of ram with zfs
[16:12:38] <koollman> it doesn't require *that* much ram, really
[16:12:46] <hexnewbie> ZFS is also more maintenance and headaches, which is why switched half my machines to btrfs from zfs. Even at the risk of losing all my data to btrfs *again*

[16:13:04] <Gaboradon> I guess I'll keep it 99% full then, really a few megs it doesn't matter, but I'll fill it mostly as I have little budget

It seems to connect but I don't have internet and the CLI is stuck at "ignoring non-forwardable exclude route 0.0.0.0/32". I'm too much of a network noob to understand that. It is a machine with arch and I ssh'd into it. Am I missing some configuration? The vpn is from my university and it
[16:45:18] <kek_> simply states "you can use anyconnect, no config needed" but I'm on openconnect, so... any ideas what I might have to configure?
[16:45:56] <Gaboradon> I would need at least 1 or two more 4TBs to duplicate everything, right now. So this'll be a process that'll take some months in not more, duplicating as I can afford more HDDs
[16:46:01] *** Guest4 is now known as m3e
[16:46:36] <Gaboradon> actually more like 2-3 4TBs

[16:48:47] <uwharrie> so you're experimenting with filesystems and deduplication on the only copy of your mission critical data
[16:48:48] <Gaboradon> Question is, whether I use the NTFS source to make each BTRFS and ZFS duplicate HDDs, or use one of the new to use as sorce for the second copy?
[16:50:07] <tirnanog> kek_: it means that it either did or didn't honour a request to add an entry to the route table for 0.0.0.0/32 as a destination. it's a bit hard to tell, given the curious wording. such a route would imply routing _all_ traffic through the VPN peer.
[16:50:31] <Gaboradon> First I'll go make the 4TB BTRFS one, then when I do the duplicate 4TB ZFS, would I rather use the BTRFS as source data or the NTFS one I originally used to make the BTRFS ... this may be such a detail or edge case tho.
[16:50:32] <tirnanog> I might add that doing so could also then disrupt existing connections, depending on the circumstances.
[16:50:58] <Gaboradon> That NTFS could have a bit rot right there in the middle, would be unlucky.
[16:51:22] <Gaboradon> uwharrie: I wasn't talking about deduplication,

[16:51:45] <kek_> tirnanog, route table of what? And isn't the point of a VPN mostly to just routing all traffic through the VPN? How would I figure out why it didn't honour that request?
[16:51:57] <tirnanog> kek_: of wherever you invoked this VPN client.
[16:52:25] <koollman> Gaboradon: first, make checksums of all current files. later you can check your copies against the checksums, at least
[16:52:32] <tirnanog> kek_: no, that is by no means the point of VPN routing, necessarily. for example, if I connect to my work VPN, it doesn't mean I want all IPv4 traffic being conveyed through my work place. far from it.
[16:52:38] *** Quits: lsrtl_ (~lsrtl@user/lsrtl) (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
[16:52:46] <tirnanog> kek_: it is, however, a valid use case.
[16:52:46] <koollman> (and don't store the checksums on the ntfs drive, at least not at first)
[16:53:56] <Gaboradon> uwharrie: I'm aware I will have no benefit of COW because all files are unique and the disk will be full so only one instance of data, no data saving and no data recovery from COW, or whatever features it also provides.
[16:53:59] <flimsypondreed> VPN providers have muddied the term VPN
[16:54:10] <tirnanog> kek_: either way, the routing table must be adjusted to determine what should and shouldn't be routed over the tunnel, once established, and the message in question concerns that process.
[16:54:15] <flimsypondreed> majority of people just use them as a proxy
[16:54:33] <flimsypondreed> unless it's a corporate/private network
[16:54:47] <koollman> kek_: the message means either there's a problem on the remote side, or openconnect didn't understand some parameter correctly
[16:54:54] <Gaboradon> koollman: Indeed, thanks for reminding me, I was thinking about this already back when I was making NTFS archives, never finished completing the sort/structure becuse of time so never got to more stuff on-top

[16:55:05] <kek_> tirnanog, koollman ok thanks, gonna do some reading then.
[16:55:26] <koollman> 0.0.0.0/32 is really not a useful route in your context. maybe the intended one is 0.0.0.0/0
[16:56:03] <koollman> or maybe the cause is something completely different, I do not use anyconnect/openconnect, but I expect those software to be 'regular' ssl vpn stuff

[19:12:23] <nvz> Dagmar: perhaps you should try rather than a bind mount, and overlay mount such that your new install being debootstrapped has its /etc/ overlay mounted on the actual host /etc/ so that when things install in the chroot they install to the right place but it can still read the files from the host
[19:12:44] <nvz> I've only ever read about overlay, I've never actually used it, but I think this is a case where it would work

[19:13:47] <Dagmar> When one chroots into a part of the filesystem to essentially "play pretend" that they're on the live system, the things inside that chroot _have to work_
[19:14:15] <Dagmar> What's in the etc/resolv.conf file is utterly mistaken at that point, because systemd and friends are *not* running inside the chroot
[19:14:30] <nvz> I've been using linux exclusively about two decades and I'm certified in it, I get the idea of something as simple as a chroot
[19:14:34] <Dagmar> The sensible thing to do is just temporarily move the symlink aside and replace it with some usable parameters
[19:14:51] <tirnanog> DPA: you could cp -L /etc/resolv.conf into the prospective root filesystem somewhere. upon chrooting, you could test -L /etc/resolv.conf and, if true, replace with the aforementioned resolv.conf (regular) file. you would, however, need to be careful as concerns the matter of subsequently restoring the symlink (perhaps, by way of an exit trap).

[19:53:08] <akk> grub1 was super easy compared to grub2. But I doubt grub1 was ever updated to deal with EFI, hasn't it been unmaintained for over a decade?

[21:57:07] <GaM3r2Xtreme> i think it's a hardware issue with the controller. that's the only way i can see buttons just spamming themselves apart. linux is seeing the controller
[21:57:46] <hexnewbie> Yeah, I don't think Linux can crap its pants in a way that wouldn't be fixed with a reboot in this particular instance

[21:59:17] <GaM3r2Xtreme> any controller that uses xinput is basically going to work on linux. xinput is really standardized, if I'm not mistaken.
[21:59:19] <hexnewbie> Of course, userspace programs are free to do anything, so we can't rule out the existence of some software on rendar's computer that is at the root of the issue and triggers it after every reboot, but that's... unlikely and probably will show in lsof for /dev/input/js
[21:59:46] <hexnewbie> GaM3r2Xtreme: My gamepads don't show up in xinput I think. I don't have them with me now to test that, though
[22:01:20] <GaM3r2Xtreme> xinput i think is more of the api/protocol for the controller. i guess there is a command 'xinput' for linux, but I don't know much on that front.

[23:50:06] <rendar_> ok
[23:50:14] <Ludon> is it possible to get through linux without touching python?
[23:50:22] <rendar_> you don't have to be sorry, you're right, and i apologize for that
[23:50:27] <hodapp> enh, OS wars are sorta like getting drunk. sure, it's fun the first 1,372 times but if you still enjoy it a lot for its own sake at the 1,373rd time you have a problem
