[22:59:08] <Orbstheorem> Today, I finally understood why [highmem](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/vm/highmem.html) was needed. Some 'magical config options' that I had used in the past now make sense :D
[22:59:44] <Orbstheorem> > High memory (highmem) is used when the size of physical memory approaches or exceeds the maximum size of virtual memory.
[22:59:44] <Orbstheorem> I may have to git-blame this... I never found such a clear explaination in my time...
[22:59:58] <Orbstheorem> s/explaination/explanation/
[23:02:32] <Orbstheorem> I knew it was needed by PAE, and funny enough played a little with `vmap` and `kmap_atomic` to map DMA buffers from highmem. But in the back of my head the explaination was always "devices and userspace (may) need it" for some reason...
[23:03:14] <Orbstheorem> Anyways, back to my main research: How do I mount a tmpfs that can't be swapped.
