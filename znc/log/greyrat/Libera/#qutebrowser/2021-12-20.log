[01:29:45] <bdju> can you seriously not tab-complete in the save dialog anymore? I'm gonna cry...
[01:29:59] <bdju> it keeps deleting what I typed. I have to do some weird dance with the arrow keys now
[01:30:24] <bdju> if it wasn't from an update, I also am running qutebrowser in wayland mode instead of xwayland mode now in case that'd change something
[01:30:28] <The-Compiler> bdju: tab again over the ..
[01:30:41] <The-Compiler> bdju: and yes the .. should probably go away
[01:31:01] <bdju> okay, you're right, that works
[01:31:08] <bdju> that's less horrible but still annoying
[01:32:00] <bdju> if I have to up a directory I usually just press ctrl-backspace a few time in the text boxt
[01:32:03] <bdju> s/boxt/box
[01:32:08] <The-Compiler> I can't disagree
[01:32:38] <The-Compiler> It's a side effect of a PR and I did the release before noticing another PR fixing that
[01:37:29] <bdju> another issue I just realized, text isn't appearing for lots of elements on certain webpages. I can't read the changelog, stuff is missing on gitlab, but amazon.com looks normal
[01:38:21] <bdju> https://waifupaste.moe/raw/r6W here's the qutebrowser github page as an example
[01:40:14] <bdju> restarting the browser didn't fix it
[01:54:41] <The-Compiler> fun
[01:54:47] <The-Compiler> bdju: can you reproduce it when starting with --temp-basedir?
[01:55:38] <bdju> The-Compiler: yes
[01:57:44] <bdju> I think I have a third problem also. I'm getting double-typing of some text in qutebrowser. I'll press : or O and then as I type there'll be a bit of lag and one or several of the letters will end up doubled. I haven't noticed this happening in other programs.
[01:59:06] <bdju> it can even happen with the : itself and end up with me typing ::set and having to go back to fix it
[01:59:27] <The-Compiler> bdju: no idea about that one, that's pretty much handled by Qt
[01:59:31] <bdju> ah okay
[02:00:22] <The-Compiler> bdju: the missing text one sounds familiar
[02:00:39] <The-Compiler> bdju: can you reproduce with --temp-basedir --qt-flag disable-seccomp-filter-sandbox
[02:00:46] <The-Compiler> bdju: and if yes, what about no-sandbox instead
[02:02:03] <bdju> with those arguments the text appears!
[02:03:49] <The-Compiler> bdju: how did you install QtWebEngine? What distribution?
[02:03:59] <bdju> I'm on guix system
[02:04:53] <The-Compiler> I can't find the issue right now, but it happens if your QtWebEngine is too old and your glibc is too new
[02:05:03] <bdju> oh okay
[02:09:30] <The-Compiler> bdju: https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1164975
[02:09:52] <The-Compiler> bdju: fix is here: https://codereview.qt-project.org/c/qt/qtwebengine-chromium/+/374232 (landed in QtWebEngine 5.15.7 IIRC)
[02:15:46] <bdju> thanks, I'll report it to my distro

[13:10:23] <emanuele6> The-Compiler: i know that, but that is unrelated
[13:10:45] <emanuele6> i was talking about injecting paths in qutebrowser commands
[13:12:19] <emanuele6> like:   config.bind(";a", f"message-info {qbcommand.quote(var)}")
[13:12:46] <emanuele6> otherwise if var contains ; or " or \ or ' etc it will not write the correct message
[13:13:46] <The-Compiler> well yeah, the command syntax is a bit too ad-hoc to even allow for escaping everything

[18:08:41] <ninewise> well I'm still wanting to write a parser for the commands
[18:08:52] <ninewise> should you decide on which type of parser we want
[18:09:53] <ninewise> I suppose I could extend my proposal with parenthesis (though actually I'm now realizing <> would be better then (), since they cannot occur in URL's)
[18:09:59] <ninewise> *than
[18:18:15] *** Joins: mord0d (~mord0d@gateway/tor-sasl/mord0d)
[18:33:01] <The-Compiler> ninewise: well I suppose the first thing to decide would be whether to hand-roll it or to use a library like lark
[18:33:40] <The-Compiler> ninewise: but I'd say it's probably simple enough to hand-roll one, the trickier part is probably integrating it with everything touching command line parsing in qutebrowser
[18:39:26] <ninewise> myeah you do say simple enough, but we're talking partial parser here, right?
[18:39:43] <ninewise> which is interesting, which is why I'm interested
[18:39:52] <ninewise> but also not simple
[18:40:26] <ninewise> anyway, a partial parser would also parse partial commands, and could thus return the current expected type of word
[18:40:36] <ninewise> which means it would integrate with completion
[18:41:25] <ninewise> (think, parsing ':open htt' would return "this is incomplete, please complete URLs starting with htt")
[18:41:49] *** Joins: nitrowheels (~nitrowhee@151.95.83.100)
[18:42:21] <ninewise> (while parsing ':open somequickmark' would return a proper complete parsing if that's a quickmark)
[18:42:59] <The-Compiler> well, I guess from a shell-like parser's POV those two wouldn't be very interesting
[18:43:14] <ninewise> or did you have some other type of parser in mind?
[18:43:15] <The-Compiler> but e.g.  :set setting "some val
[18:43:19] <The-Compiler> would be
[18:44:06] <The-Compiler> this wouldn't need to parse URLs, but things like quotes, {replacements}, ;;, that kind of stuff
[18:44:25] <ninewise> oh
[18:44:43] <ninewise> I those those things *and* the types for completion
[18:44:46] <ninewise> *though
[18:46:19] <The-Compiler> well, options/flags probably, but completions would probably still act on strings in the end
[18:46:21] <ninewise> (a  :set setting "some val  would return incomplete, and complete for values starting with 'some val' for that setting if there are any listed for that setting, followed by a ")
[18:46:40] <The-Compiler> https://github.com/tridactyl/tridactyl/issues/789 might have some inspiration
[18:51:15] <The-Compiler> ninewise: I imagine it more like the completion function being called with, say [Literal("set"), QuotedLiteral("some val", quote="'")] or whatever, and the completion function can then tell the parser to replace the "some val" part by something else, but honestly I don't really know how the end result will look like at all
[18:51:54] <ninewise> that's about what I was thinking
[18:52:13] <ninewise> except I was thinking from the perspective of the parser wrapping the completer
[18:52:19] <ninewise> not the complete wrapping the parser
[18:52:41] <The-Compiler> ninewise: my main aim is a) to have a consistent way of escaping stuff (say, e.g., ;; inside quotes not splitting off a second command), and b) to have a way to run a pre-parsed command line e.g. for :later without having to hand around quoted strings
[18:53:52] <ninewise> yeah (a) is clear and (b) is just an artifact of having a proper parse
[18:54:09] <ninewise> you just pickle AST's
[18:54:18] <ninewise> or s/pickle/json/
[18:54:58] <ninewise> or parse/unparse them properly
[18:55:36] <ninewise> I might just throw something together over christmas holidays as a proposal
[18:55:51] <ninewise> even just to conclude that's not the type of parsing we want
[18:56:02] <The-Compiler> sure, I might defer this until February or so though, depending on how detailed it is
