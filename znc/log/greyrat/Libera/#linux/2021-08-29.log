[01:40:36] <kuku> No1x3r0: why dont you do yourself a favor and stop chasing your own tail. You had 3 macs and you were not happy with macOS so you bought new mac m1 because they said it will support linux and of course it doesnt. Just buy a regular laptop and run bsd/linux whatever you like. Then you can complain about boot errors, security etc...

[02:14:01] <simbaclaws> depends on how much you know about the hardware you're putting the system on and what you actually want to do with it

[02:15:26] <simbaclaws> in which case it can be shorter
[02:15:29] <codebam> depends on the package

[02:21:32] <No1x3r0> or "typical"
[02:21:33] <Guest53> What's "average"?
[02:21:35] <No1x3r0> or "general"
[02:21:49] <hassoon> average is like a boring usual thing
[02:21:52] <simbaclaws> oh come on dude, there are millions of different devices in the world, and thousands of different packages
[02:21:52] <jim> No1x3r0, your guesses tend toward the negative
[02:21:56] <simbaclaws> how can you make an average of that
[02:22:01] <hassoon> e.g No1x3r0 is an average person

[02:22:09] <hassoon> ^ profecy fulfilled
[02:22:19] <Guest53> Unsurprisingly everyone's list of packages is different so nobody can tell you how long the "average" is going to take
[02:22:33] <codebam> average compile time? probably weeks yeah
[02:22:46] <No1x3r0> hassoon an algorithm isn't a profecy
[02:22:48] <Guest53> Not even factoring in what hardware it's running on, which again, what's "average"
[02:23:02] <hassoon> algorithm ? what algorithm
[02:23:08] <No1x3r0> nevermind that
[02:23:19] <hassoon> alright then
[02:23:22] <codebam> No1x3r0: just test how long it takes to compile the kernel on your M1 and that'll give you a good idea of how long it'll take for everything else
[02:23:30] <codebam> if the kernel takes an hour grub will probably take 15 mins

[05:21:55] <ayecee> services launched with systemd can use the PrivateTmp directive to do something like that, but i don't know how you'd do that with an individual program

[05:23:29] <ayecee> b0nn: i'd assume you could do this somehow with the same "namespaces" that systemd uses to do this, but i don't know offhand how you'd do that for a single program.
[05:24:39] <b0nn> hmm the easier path might be recompilation :\

[06:04:44] <Shanzem> esselfe what was the issue you had? expand and how did down grading solve it?
[06:06:42] <esselfe> When running top one process would show 8-9% usage, but the meters kept being 0-1%. gkrellm/gkrellmd also report wrong results. I guess it's something the kernel does because 2 programs failing to parse metrics at the same time would be odd. Not too sure what it is, when I compile on multiple core it's fine.

[07:41:10] <stellaralways> What does that do?
[07:41:18] <stellaralways> Why must I do "make oldconfig" and then "make prepare"
[07:41:19] <stellaralways> ?
[07:41:28] <stellaralways> Does it rebuild entire kernel or what?
[07:41:34] <Dagmar> stellaralways: Because the leprechaun told you to?
[07:41:39] <ayecee> to regenerate include/generated/autoconf.h, i guess
[07:41:59] <Caffeinated> lol
[07:42:00] <Dagmar> You've given us no information that would lead to needing to use oldconfig
[07:42:12] <ayecee> nope, oldconfig kind of does what menuconfig does, and prepare.. i'm not sure about that one, but it doesn't build a kernel.

[07:44:06] <Dagmar> Eventually you're going to see oldconfig result in a build that ends with goo all over the floor.
[07:44:38] <Dagmar> I'm not saying don't use it, but expect to follow it up with a pass through menuconfig because it's sanity checks are a little more expansive
[07:44:41] * Lemniscate nukes a box of popcorn
[07:44:42] <ayecee> it shouldn't, if the .config was just created with menuconfig.
[07:45:03] <Dagmar> If hte .config was created with menuconfig then oldconfig isn't needed at all

[19:52:55] <mh_le> joo: I'm not suite there yet :P
[19:52:56] <ananke> TheSilentLink: random freezes can be due to many factors, there is no sufficient data based on your description to determine the root cause. it could be problems with your disk storage, network layer, etc

[19:56:30] <ananke> TheSilentLink: you'll have to gather more info, and perhaps follow process of elimination. eg: do the logs or 'dmesg' show any errors during transfer? does iftop or similar tool show network activity during those freeze times? does 'vmstat 1' show continued disk activity? does 'ifconfig' show any rx/tx errors? do other protocols transfer significant amount of data between those hosts just fine?

[21:38:33] <Dagmar> It could also be illiteracy
[21:38:35] <ananke> TheSilentLink: at this point I don't think anybody here has a clear idea of what's the scope of the problem you're trying to solve. you haven't been very clear, and the variables keep changing (wifi, ethernet). now you also mentioned that one of the devices in question is rpi4, which also implies very slow disk storage

[21:39:48] <TheSilentLink> right so it's not errors. I miss read the column errors is only 39... That isn't the why scp keeps stalling during transfers from this specific host then.
[21:39:48] <ananke> TheSilentLink: perhaps you should start from scratch, and narrow down the scope to one set of variables, and explain what's involved. otherwise, you're going to get tons of conflicting and often useless advice

[21:40:53] <TheSilentLink> ananke: the issue is that this pc connected to wifi using scp with a host connected to ethernet the transfer keeps stalling for 30 secs or more and then carries on for a couple more before stalling again. I've tried another host with scp and it is fine

[21:42:52] <ananke> we can't see what you see, and we don't do mind reading
[21:43:12] <Dagmar> Well, it's rather obvious.  The host is defective.

[22:43:40] <uwharrie> nothing wrong with using physlock, only this is working on the assumption there's only one thing controlling the state of the monitor, not two different ones operating in conflict
[22:43:45] <codebam> it's probably something you're starting in your xmonad config that's breaking it

[22:44:23] <NewLeaf> Is xmonad not a language ?
[22:44:28] <elvishjerricco> I've switched to xsecurelock for a while now, since all the other ones I found failed me, and there's documentation in their repo about how compositors sort of fundamentally break screen lockers in X

[23:55:44] <Velvet> Endeavour has a nice kernel manager ...I believe Garuda does too
[23:55:46] <Psi-Jack[m]> And if Fedora has it, Ubuntu does too.
[23:55:52] <NewLeaf> Psi-Jack oh so no to Fedora suggestion ?
[23:56:01] <Psi-Jack[m]> NewLeaf: No to all. You're SOL.
[23:56:14] <NewLeaf> Psi-Jack[m] oh :(
[23:56:20] <omero> in case no one remembers: the original question was: |2021-08-29+20:58:05|   NewLeaf)) Real quick, I thought of another question to ask: Does anyone know of a GTK Only Distro or know of a way to search for such a thing ?
[23:56:27] <NewLeaf> Psi-Jack[m] unless I regress ?
[23:56:45] <Psi-Jack[m]> NewLeaf: I mean, generally what qt is used for is support integration, theme, etc...

[23:57:07] <Guest53> If you're looking to be extremely picky about what is installed on your system you're almost always better off installing whatever distro from a minimal install and just adding the packages you are interested in.

[23:57:27] <NewLeaf> yeah but it originally was for KDE and Plasma but I think it crept into Wayland and now other projects are compiling with it.

[23:57:56] <[[R]]> what*
[23:58:09] <omero> or in other workds, you have shot yourself your feets. or higher parts.
[23:58:13] <NewLeaf> [[R]] like Manjaro Settings Manager
[23:58:25] <[[R]]> NewLeaf: okay... so exclusing one garbage dist with one garbage program...
[23:58:36] <[[R]]> NewLeaf: step 1... use a sane dist... step 2... profit

[23:58:57] <Psi-Jack[m]> Yeah, Fedora's qt stuff is literally barebones minimum.
[23:58:59] <Guest53> Not sure we really need to get into flaming distros here.

[23:59:47] <Khaytsus> See the paste I did above..  f34 Workstation install had a few in it, no idea what brought them in offhand, easily removed.  But WHY.
