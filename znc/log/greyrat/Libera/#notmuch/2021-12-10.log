[16:00:58] <juliank> ah this upgrade - notmuch:amd64 (0.33.2-1ubuntu1, 0.34.1-1ubuntu3) - broke my workflow :)

[16:01:15] <juliank> I have two email accounts, each has its own notmuch config file
[16:01:58] <juliank> neomutt was configured as set nm_default_uri="notmuch:///home/jak/mail.canonical"
[16:02:09] <juliank> with 0.34 it does not pick up emails anymore
[16:02:34] <juliank> setting the environment variable to the correct config file, which I missed doing before, fixes it
[16:02:37] <juliank> so hooray?
[16:03:24] <juliank> not sure why it worked in 0.33.2
[16:03:29] <juliank> (and earlier)
[16:03:34] <juliank> fsvo "worked"
[16:15:51] <bremner> juliank: where did / do your two notmuch config files live?
[16:16:16] <juliank> They live in /home/jak/.notmuch-config and /home/jak/mail.canonical/.notmuch-config
[16:16:27] <juliank> the workaround is special :D
[16:16:43] <bremner> oh. Yeah, it is probably a bug that the second was picked up?
[16:17:05] <bremner> or at least an unintended feature
[16:17:32] <bremner> so profiles should make this easy now from a pure notmuch point of view, but iirc there is no neomutt support yet for notmuch profiles

[19:20:21] <bremner> indeed I think there are a couple of error cases that are not handled properly still
[19:20:43] <bremner> that's the problem with adding features, it also adds bugs :P
