[00:44:04] <johnkeats6> a bundle E --> B locally behaves like a product B x F but twists globally. a connection is at each point an infinitesimal choice of how to split E into B and F directions
[00:44:13] <johnkeats6> thats how i picture them

[00:49:16] <mycroftiv> i mean algebraic geometry and topology is a huge thing, this whole insane mass of homological algebra
[00:49:35] <Ethos> somiaj with 0^0 = 1 do you mean lim x->0+ x^x = 1?
[00:49:41] <joel135> Yes, so presheaves of sets appear as a caricature of sheaves of modules, perhaps.
[00:50:15] <johnkeats6> we're talking riemannian geometry, which afaik is pretty much untainted by categories, since categorists haven't figured out how to do hard analysis
[00:50:25] <somiaj> Ethos: no 0^0 is just defined as 1, so sin(pi)^sin(pi) = 0^0 = 1 is part of the domain.

[04:48:35] <PlanckWalk> If |A| > |B| then |X| |A| >= |X| |B|
[04:48:36] <memorye> maybe infinity is really weird that way, and can result in a smaller product even though the the infinity multiplied by X was larger
[04:48:53] <memorye> thank you for steelmanning
[04:48:57] <PlanckWalk> So it's not quite that weird
[04:49:00] <droid3> However the discriminant is invariant under any coordinate change and still looks so appealing that there be a good connection
[04:49:17] <memorye> yeah i know that holds for finitenumbers A and B
[04:50:15] <droid3> Like is there a connection perhaps to the discriminant of the characteristic equation of the quadratic form instead of the quadratic form itself for the PDE.

[04:51:33] <droid3> Because the case of n = 2 independent variables we have a connection with eigenvalues of the characteristic equation of the quadratic form.
[04:52:13] <PlanckWalk> memorye: If |A| >= |B| then there exists a surjection f:A->B.  You can use that to construct a surjection g:X x A -> X x B

[04:52:38] <PlanckWalk> E.g. just take  g(x, a) = (x, f(a)).
[04:52:43] <droid3> Yet maybe the key is for n > 2 independent variables we look at the connections between the discriminant of the characteristic equation itself instead of the discriminant of the quadratic form for the PDE.
[04:54:12] <droid3> Either way i am all set on the classification of linear PDE of second order for any amount of independent variables.
[04:55:07] <droid3> My curiosity was weather there was a connection still holding between the discriminant and eigenvalues as is so appealing for 2 independent variable case.
[04:56:17] <droid3> I know know usually most physics and applied math would only need two independent variables but for a math guy like myself i am never satisfied by not knowing.
[04:57:09] <droid3> And the connection between discriminant and eigenvalue classification for linear second order pde is so appealing to just want to use the discriminant.
[04:57:25] <droid3> IF one can do that for higher independent variables.

[04:58:10] <mycroftiv> memorye: i think the closest to what you want is that it is independent of ZFC that for all x y, x < y implies 2^x < 2^y , see https://mathoverflow.net/questions/1924/what-are-some-reasonable-sounding-statements-that-are-independent-of-zfc
[04:58:22] <droid3> I know there is another route to take is that of quadratic surfaces in many variables you can do connections with positive definite matrices to connect those to the elliptical type pde classification....etc
[04:58:54] <droid3> But this route is more cumbersome the just looking at eigenvalues.
[04:59:28] <droid3> the problem is it be much easier if we could just look at discriminants in a particular way so we wouldnt have to find eigenvalue signs.
[05:00:23] <droid3> In general characterisitic equations of high degree is a hassle to work with. And using just a discriminant computation  >0 < 0 = 0 to distingish would be so cool.

[05:32:52] <rex> but why does such an element exist?
[05:33:11] <droid3> But i dont see how in general the discriminant = 0 or < 0 is still going to work for n > 2 that the tricky part
[05:34:08] <bosspotato> because the probability of the space is 1 and is the sum of the probabilities of the elements in the space

[05:39:27] <droid3> grey error => grey area
[05:40:01] <droid3> its so appealing yet such an mystery sofar for me.
[05:40:23] <bosspotato> this is a bit hard to explain for a lack of a proper notation but the point is that if you look at every set of the form \Cap_{i=1}^\infty A_i^a_i where a_i is a sequence of 0's and 1's and A^l is defined to be A if l = 1 and the complement of A otherwise you find that those partition the space
[05:40:50] <bosspotato> and so one of those things will contain an element of nonzero probability and its probability will be less than that product by the independence of the sets
[05:41:08] <bosspotato> and its probability will be greater than zero because it contains that element

[05:47:26] <droid3> And weather one can use the discriminant of a higher order quadratic form with say 4 variables to classify a 3 variable pde say....so maybe not all is lost for the discriminant in the classification of pde.

[07:26:20] <droid3> I know i know even if you could solve all nonlinear pde of first order in this way. You still dont have a way to know when solution exist or any thing about the number of solutions.
[07:27:37] <droid3> Anyway i think this is essentially correct method to solve any first order nonlinear pde PROVIDE THAT YOU CAN ALWAYS COME UP WITH A GRADIENT FUNCTION THAT FITS THE EQUATION
[07:27:54] <droid3> This may not be doable in alot of cases but still
[07:28:13] *** Joins: X-Scale` (~ARM@83.223.250.30)
[07:28:22] <droid3> its cool because if you compute out enough gradients forms for different function you might hit on a form that you can use.
[07:28:51] <droid3> Anyway i am going to play around with this a little more at a later point just figured i make people aware of my method.
[07:29:27] <droid3> Or should i say just a generalization of a well known method aka the method of characterisitc curves /integral surfaces... applied to nonlinear first order

[07:30:41] <droid3> One can see if he can find a gradient function that works to use the method to solve any first order nonlinear pde equation as well.
[07:30:52] <droid3> Note this would only work for first order PDE
[07:31:25] <droid3> for second order , third order ,...etc weather there linear or nonlinear you cannt really apply method of characterisitics in this classical sense.

[08:39:40] <brheurhe> how do you prove that there's no continuous bijection from [0, 1] to (0, 1)?
[08:44:51] <int-e> staa: well, -phi(t) satisfies a similar system with x, x', y and y' replaced by -x, -x', -y and -y' throughout.
[08:44:58] *** Joins: plankster (~plankster@user/plankers)
[08:45:15] <int-e> staa: and then you can show that that's equivalent to the original one
[08:46:45] <int-e> brheurhe: hmm, what notion of continuity is that? In topology, note that the primage of (0,1) is open...

[08:47:52] <staa> thanks, I'll try that!
[08:48:43] <brheurhe> the limit definition of continuity is what we've been using so ig its by that
[08:49:26] <cherim> Usually it is asked in the context of topology induced on [0,1]
[08:52:58] <int-e> surely if it's continuous on [0,1] I can extend it to a continuous function on the reals, by stitching on constant functions to the left and right
[08:53:35] <int-e> (and only assume the surjectivity part of the bijection)

[17:04:02] <mycroftiv> yes, it is allied with computer formalization of mathematics, that was a big part of Voevodsky's motivations
[17:04:37] <mycroftiv> he found doing his research in homotopy theory was becoming impossible to not make mistakes because of the complexity. he was a fields medal winner and still found errors in his papers  years later.
[17:06:08] <[itchyjunk]> Oh interesting, never heard of him
[17:06:10] <mycroftiv> and he made the fascinating discovery that a modification to the computation rules of the identity type in martin-löf type theory enabled type theory to correspond to the algebraic content of core principles in homotopy
[17:06:20] <[itchyjunk]> so he decided you need computer to help you not make mistake?
[17:06:22] <[itchyjunk]> ahh
[17:07:18] <mycroftiv> yes, so he decided that it made sense to put all mathematics into a common foundation where homotopic path-equality was the basic notion and it could all be checked by a computer

[19:08:54] <[itchyjunk]> Pi-sistance, you keep writing radians in equation

[19:11:42] <Pi-sistance> [itchyjunk] its the only unit left after dimensional analysis of a complex number comprised of  2 complex numbers in a fraction. the radian is attached to only the imaginary parts of both.
[19:11:57] <[itchyjunk]> what unit?
[19:12:02] <[itchyjunk]> radian is dimensionless
[19:12:19] <[itchyjunk]> what is the symbol for radians you use in paper?
[19:12:29] <[itchyjunk]> you make a circle for degree right?
[19:12:35] <[itchyjunk]> you write out radians on a paper too?
[19:12:48] <Pi-sistance>  it was initially radians/second but the seconds were used to show that the whole finished complex number on the LHS was equal to resistance
[19:13:04] <Pi-sistance> so im left with fockin radians
[19:13:10] <nejimban> rain3: try with the change of variable v = tan(x)^2
[19:13:17] <[itchyjunk]> you're still saying radians
[19:13:31] <[itchyjunk]> your write out literal "radians" on a piece of paper?
[19:14:03] <Pi-sistance> it was already there as rad/s
[19:14:11] <Pi-sistance> which is angular velocity
[19:14:35] <rain3> nejimban: I will, thank you
[19:14:47] <Pi-sistance> after its seperated from /s I didnt think I could just reduce it to 1, but seems I can
[19:14:55] <[itchyjunk]> its in  per sec
[19:14:59] <[itchyjunk]> not rad per sec
[19:15:03] <[itchyjunk]> if you're writing out dimensions
[19:15:10] <[itchyjunk]> because radian, again, is dimensionless

[19:52:17] <Batzy> usually if you're doing a monte-carlo simulation, you're probably focused on bounding the error
[19:52:44] <Batzy> you also have two extremes for monte-carlo. Maybe your first check works, or maybe you have to go through the entire space to find something that works

[19:54:10] <Batzy> savask: imagine doing prime factorization via monte carlo for example

[19:55:29] <isekaijin> Batzy: I don't really know much about MC simulation, but for me the prototypical example is approximating pi by sampling uniformly distributed points on the square [-1,1]^2, and checking how many of them are on the unit disc.
[19:55:40] <Batzy> isekaijin: you take your N and you montecarlo to guess factors 2 to sqrt(N)
[19:55:43] <isekaijin> How does prime factorization fit in this model?
[19:55:44] <Batzy> that's one way
[19:56:01] <isekaijin> Batzy: That seems horribly inefficient.
[19:56:04] <Batzy> it is

[22:55:13] <f-a> thanks
[22:57:51] <somiaj> sage is nice, but it is very large. If you know python sympy + numpy can often be more effiecent.
[22:58:01] <somiaj> sage does make syntax seem more like a CAS than a programing language though
[22:59:36] <somiaj> octave is also nice if you like more matlab like experience

[23:36:24] <biberao> ok
[23:36:50] <somiaj> Sage's various plot functions use matplotlib (for 2D plots). So you would need matplotlib if you wanted to use sage for 2d plots
[23:37:00] <somiaj> I don't think sage as setup so you can use different plotters for 2D plots.
