[18:10:04] <Joanna> If the Russians had not annexed Crimea and rescued Syria they would have lost important military bases. The people of Crimea also wanted to rejoin Russia. There have been many attempts to carry out a coup in Russia. If anything Russians have been far too patient for far too long in my opinion. Maybe they felt they needed to do it  as part of their overall strategy. If you listen to podcast with Scott Ritter he explains how the 
[18:10:04] <Joanna> Russians have already won. All the hype is about weapon makers trying to drum up business as usual.

[18:22:04] <Joanna> It’s a stall tactic to try to prolong the war as long as possible. The us and U.K. have no problem with getting millions of Europeans killed. They have done it before.

[19:06:08] <Joanna> CalimeroTeknik: I think _inky inky_ might know some people there we can ask him what’s happening
[19:08:36] <CalimeroTeknik> there = Moscow?
[19:09:06] <Joanna> There are some that speculate that the war is part of agenda by the powers that be to topple countries economies. On the other hand Russia has been helping other countries fight back against NATO lately so this could just be another incidence of the same thing that is getting more publicity
