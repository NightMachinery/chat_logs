[17:57:04] <Orbstheorem> TIL my matrix server is federating with inf.ethz.ch ^^
[17:57:17] <Orbstheorem> (Pure random unrelated log walk)
[17:57:57] <Orbstheorem> Completely irrelevant, yet it gives me a slight feeling of satisfaction.
[18:01:15] <Orbstheorem> There's also matrix.debian.social and a surprising amount of `.hu` servers x)
[18:54:06] <afontain[m]> Doing a log walk on the domain names of a matrix server is great
[18:58:15] <Orbstheorem> I wish I had a proper log query solution.
[18:58:53] <Orbstheorem> And ideally have an ML connector to detect outliers.
[18:59:14] <Orbstheorem> I could probably go a long way with prometheus.
[18:59:23] <Orbstheorem> If only I had the time...
[19:01:10] <afontain[m]> With infinite time I could make so many cool things :)
[19:02:06] <Orbstheorem> Ikr
[19:02:37] <Orbstheorem> Isn't that what holidays are for?
[19:03:05] <Orbstheorem> I feel life is so clumped with regular stuff.
[19:03:30] <afontain[m]> afaik holidays are not infinitely long
[19:03:44] <Notkea> could just use netstat with the right arguments to show the remote addresses of the currently established connections :D
[19:04:09] <Notkea> holiwhat?
[19:04:22] <Orbstheorem> Yeah, but that only shows what's connected NOW
[19:04:49] <Notkea> indeed
