[02:48:25] <arooni> i have a ssd i pulled out of my now sadly dead thinkpad.  i had ubuntu 20.04 installed on it and set up whole disk encryption during the setup process
[02:48:31] <arooni> i now have another ubuntu machine i can hook it up to
[02:48:36] <arooni> how do i permanently decrypt it
[02:48:45] <arooni> i know the passphrase; not an issue
[02:49:04] <ravage> you have to mount it and copy the data to another drive
[02:49:14] <ravage> there is no decryption process
[02:49:56] <arooni> is this something that could be done via a virtual machine on my macbook?
[02:50:07] <sarnold> arooni: there's some notes on the arch wiki on how to do an in-place decryption, but there's so many warning boxes there that I'd personally go with ravage's advice and just copy it to another drive https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Removing_system_encryption
[02:50:34] <arooni> ok i'll go with the recommended approach

[03:11:06] <sarnold> hard to say :( I hear that our standard cloud baseline is 10 gigs, and it feels like I see folks troiubleshooting nearly-full filesystems a bit too often :) but those machines may have different needs than yours..
[03:11:21] <matsaman> arooni: what VM system?
[03:11:31] <arooni> yeah i'm not sure what i need it for right now but i do like mirroring my production server to make sure stuff works
[03:11:35] <arooni> maybe 25g?
[03:11:45] <matsaman> 30GB is like a _huge_ /desktop/ install, for reference
[03:11:45] <arooni> i have 1.5tb+ available
[03:12:00] <sarnold> yeah.. i've done physical system installs with 30gigs on / and never really thought about space :)
[03:12:00] <matsaman> so 30GB should always be enough, by a very large margin

[03:12:30] <matsaman> unless you want to store in the same spot like, enormous data for some reason, obviously
[03:12:49] <arooni> wondering if its smart enough to expand the size of the volume depending on usage; so it doesnt just write a 30gb file up front
[03:12:56] <arooni> virutalbox i think used to do that

[03:13:12] <arooni> yes

[14:29:55] <lesshaste> guiverc, thanks!

[14:31:25] <BrianHechinger[m> General purpose VMs on my desktop, firewall VMs on my NUC and PCI Passthrough GPUs on a single box for two kids (two GPUs)
[14:31:40] <guiverc> 20.04 is the 2020-April release; `qemu | 1:4.2-3ubuntu6.19        | focal-updates            | source, amd64, arm64, armhf, ppc64el, riscv64, s390x` is the package for that version; 6.0 is available for later release(s)  ; security fixes only are back-ported to older releases usually

[14:33:10] <BrianHechinger[m> Boo! Is there a way to install 6.x easily then? My google-fu is failing me.

[15:03:12] <jo-erlend> BrianHechinger[m, Ubuntu is a stable distro. The purpose is to make sure things change as little as possible. Therefore, you won't get the newest versions of packages. Ubuntu 21.10 has Qemu 6.0.

[15:07:38] <ducasse> BrianHechinger[m: there might be a ppa available, but that's entirely at your own risk. most likely 6.* depends on other packages being later versions, though

[15:11:01] <BrianHechinger[m> I have a PC (running 20.04) that runs two PCI Passthrough VMs. Each VM gets a GPU and one of the onboard USB controllers. The one VM is fine. The second one causes the host to lock up or spontaneously reboot when it tries to attach the USB controller (GPU is fine).
