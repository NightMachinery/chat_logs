[00:30:59] <ThePendulum> man I'm getting sick of reddit just randomly filtering out my comments
[00:31:52] <ThePendulum> it's a 10 year old account
[00:32:05] <Bitweasil> Have you tried only posting things in the narrow window that you're allowed to think by the tech overlords?
[00:32:57] <ThePendulum> if anything it kind of shows most of the time there's no greater intention to it, it's just some arbitrary algorithm
[00:33:29] <ThePendulum> it was an image photoshopped to demonstrate something, literally nothing opinionated about it
[00:33:58] <Bitweasil> *shrug*
[00:34:03] <Bitweasil> The whole modern internet has gone to hell in a handbasket.
[00:34:22] <Bitweasil> All algorithm based, big data extracting, centralized, venture capital, eyeball-grabbing.
[00:34:26] <Bitweasil> It's a pile of shit anymore.
[00:34:46] <ThePendulum> I blame the viability of spam more than the algorithms themselves, it's fucking impossible to manage a platform without some automated moderation
[00:35:14] <Bitweasil> Sure, but when you value "engagement" over everything else, it's also hard to walk that line.
[00:35:29] <Bitweasil> I'll counter argue that if a platform cannot be managed without automated moderation, the platform is *too big.*
[00:36:24] <ThePendulum> we have a chat site with <1k users and we can't get around it, we need an automated system even for reporting child abuse to the authorities because of how many filthy people there are out there
[00:36:35] <ThePendulum> and that's just a fraction of people trying their luck with scams and spam
[00:37:08] <Bitweasil> *nods*
[00:37:09] <ThePendulum> I don't really see what you're supposed to do when your platform becomes too big, split it up in a thousand similar sites?
[00:37:50] <Bitweasil> What's the platform based around?  Just running something weird helps a lot...
[00:38:41] <joepie91> ThePendulum: that's the wrong angle
[00:38:52] <ThePendulum> joepie91: what is?
[00:39:02] <joepie91> the correct question is "how are platforms designed to scale to planet size, and how do you not do that"
[00:39:05] <unfinity> ãƒ»ã‚œã‚œãƒ»ã€‚ã€‚ãƒ»ã‚œ â€‹ ã‚œ\_â€‹Ã¸< Qâ€‹UACK!

[00:39:09] <unfinity> Well this is awkward, the duck needs to think about it. You can try again in 7 seconds.
[00:39:10] <unfinity> imMute you befriended a duck in 4.383 seconds! You have made friends with 2 ducks in #datahoarder.
[00:39:13] <joepie91> the massive scale of social media is not an accident or natural phenomenon
[00:39:18] <joepie91> they're specifically built to do that
[00:39:48] <joepie91> so just... don't do that
[00:39:53] <Bitweasil> ^^
[00:40:05] <Bitweasil> You don't need to "go huge" to have a viable community on the internet.
[00:40:38] <ThePendulum> you don't have to go huge to run into abuse issues, you would have to actively prevent your platform from growing beyond... 100 people or so
[00:41:13] <joepie91> the goal is not to eliminate any and all abuse
[00:41:20] <joepie91> the goal is to eliminate abuse at a scale that is no longer moderatable
[00:41:26] <joepie91> you have much more breathing room there
[00:42:55] <Bitweasil> Yeah, I'm not saying that you can't have moderation, but if it grows to the point where a few human moderators can't handle it... well, you either need to find more humans or find a way to split/reduce scale/etc.
[00:43:02] <Bitweasil> Automated moderation is just horrid.
[00:43:18] <ThePendulum> so what do you do when your platform does eventually become that big just because it's naturally useful or entertaining?
[00:43:43] <Bitweasil> You need to figure out more moderators, or start restricting growth.
[00:43:51] <Bitweasil> It's a hard set of problems.
[00:44:22] <Bitweasil> Or you go full on Facebook, write shitty automation, and every time anyone calls you on it, you say "We are so, so sorry you caught us doing that, we will try to do the work and learn the lessons and do better [to not get caught] in the future."

[00:47:32] <ThePendulum> given the moderator to user ratio we have on our site, if youtube had to achieve that, they'd need to employ about the population of Russia
[00:49:12] <Bitweasil> Well.
[00:49:18] <Bitweasil> Then YouTube might not want to use that model.
[00:49:24] <Bitweasil> YouTube shouldn't exist at that scale either.
[00:49:33] <Bitweasil> It's far, far too much control over the discourse of video on the internet.
[00:49:38] <ThePendulum> the basic concept might, the comment section probably shouldn't
[00:49:42] <Bitweasil> And leads the idiotic "chasing the algorithm" style of video.
[00:50:56] <Bitweasil> "I ALMOST BLEW MYSELF UP!!!!! HUGE O FACE!   CRAZY THUMBNAIL!  INSANE FACE!"  "Guys, guys, listen.  I need you to SMASH THAT LIKE BUTTON.  And subscribe.  Listen, listen, you need to go sign up for my Patron, and follow me on Instgram, Twitter, Livejournal, and Facebook for updates.  Now, anyway, so there I was... oh, darn, out of time.  Well, subscribe and you'll get notified when I continue the story in 5 minutes, with my next video!"
[00:51:03] <ThePendulum> how /do/ you categorize and prioritize that amount of content. limiting the number of videos already starts falling apart at like 10 videos per day
[00:51:23] <Bitweasil> I don't know, I actually hate video with a passion.
[00:51:37] <Bitweasil> And the whole YouTube community is just an excuse for tons of bandwidth to communicate no information or nearly none.
[00:51:43] <ThePendulum> I wonder how effective it is to ask people to smash the like button
[00:52:17] <ThePendulum> Bitweasil: okay, but now you're suggesting to impose /more/ control over the discourse of video? :P
[00:52:31] <Bitweasil> No, just don't subsidize the hosting with web ads.
[00:52:37] <Bitweasil> It's far from clear if YouTube is at all profitable on their own.
[00:52:50] <Bitweasil> Blow up most of the centralized internet and the place gets an awful lot better.
[00:53:18] <ThePendulum> they do have a built-in patreon model now that seems better in theory, just, well, it's youtube executing it

[00:57:37] <ThePendulum> haven't really used it properly but afaik you can support channels you like with a monthly payment if they enable it
[00:57:57] <joepie91> <ThePendulum> so what do you do when your platform does eventually become that big just because it's naturally useful or entertaining?
[00:57:59] <ThePendulum> not sure if you can do one-offs
[00:58:04] <joepie91> I frankly do not believe that this is a scenario that exists
[00:58:17] <joepie91> I have never once seen a single case of this
[00:58:31] <joepie91> prior to intentional engineering for planet scale, communities didn't grow this big either, they naturally segmented
[00:58:48] <joepie91> so I frankly don't think this is a question worth discussing until there's evidence that it can actually happen
[00:58:52] <ThePendulum> joepie91: you think if google never bought youtube it would've just stopped growing?
[00:59:02] <joepie91> youtube was engineered for planet scale
[00:59:11] <joepie91> the same is true for basically every 'startup'
[00:59:27] <joepie91> like, that's the point of a startup, it's a baby monopolist
[00:59:29] <ThePendulum> well, yeah, fair enough, I concur no one intentionally designs their platforms to break after the first 100 users
[00:59:45] <joepie91> that isn't what I said
[00:59:55] <joepie91> actually nvm, I misread that
[01:00:21] <joepie91> but yeah, point being, if you want to see how communities grow naturally, you have to look at things that aren't startups

[21:23:20] <softpaw> imMute 100% hate leads to war then fund both sides with arms to get into debt
[21:23:50] <imMute> or just keeps people from fighting the ones *actually* oppressing them.
