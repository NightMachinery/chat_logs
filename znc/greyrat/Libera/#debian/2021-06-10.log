[03:12:05] <velix> Hmm... Normally Debian is into security, but why has journald been chosen as primary log storage? journald doesn't have a function to deal with damages in the binary logfile.
[03:13:13] <velix> If a bitflip acurres, journalctl stops parsing the log at this position. The parts after the bitflip can't be accessed anymore.
[03:13:22] <xx> velix: debian is not specifically a security-focused distro
[03:13:24] <rudi_s> velix: The default is AFAIK still to install an rsyslogd in addition to journald
[03:13:37] <velix> rudi_s: Sure, but ... I'll answer this in a secondd.
[03:13:40] <velix> Logs can't be removed granulaly. etc.
[03:13:45] <rudi_s> And btw. this is more safety than security.
[03:14:04] <velix> xx: I know, but normally Debian community think twice about such problems ;)
[03:14:32] <velix> rudi_s: The problem is, most applications directly writing to journald are writing important variables to journld variables. Those don't land in normal syslog.
[03:14:36] <xx> velix: have RAM modules with ECC, and use a filesystem with checksumming features = you don't need to care about bitflips or random corruption to journals
[03:14:56] <velix> rudi_s: rsyslog has a plugin to parse journald, but it has bad performance, as written in man page.
[03:15:02] <velix> xx: It just was an example.
[03:15:10] <velix> xx: The bad thing is: journald cannot deal with corrupt log files.
[03:15:16] <xx> true
[03:15:19] <velix> That's in discussion since 2013.
[03:15:22] <xx> hence try to avoid corruption in the first place
[03:15:41] <velix> xx: As soon as they detect corruption, they're rotating the file.
[03:15:50] <velix> But if the file is bad "in the middle", you're doomed.
[03:16:03] <xx> it's just like in politics - you can't prevent people from taking money, everyone will accept $1M, but you can work on making sure corruption is not necessary
[03:16:34] <velix> xx: But you could make them pay tax ;)
[03:17:36] <velix> What really annoys me about journald: you cannot remove logs granularly. That's a bad thing in GDPR world.

[03:59:27] <r3> speaking of English, say you were writing about a series of toasters.  The TST-03 and the TST-07.  They are ostensibly in the same 'family', the "TST" family, but their model numbers have incremented.  However, I cannot say that the TST-07 was "4 models after" the TST-03 because there weren't any TST-04 or TST-06.
[04:01:16] <r3> if I wished to refer to them in order of release, I also cannot say that the TST-07 was released after the TST-03 as - let's say - they were released at the same time.  So, the question:  how would I refer to them?  Is it "ordinal"?  "In Ordinal Order"?
[04:01:16] <velix> mutante: is there also an asocial channel?

[04:08:03] <sney> #debian is staffed by volunteers so the enforcement is not always 100% the same, but that doesn't mean you're entitled to ignore how the community is set up.

[04:09:43] <r3> give me a break already, it was dead quiet in here, and - as a matter of fact - you piping up has actually CAUSED more "offtopic" chatter, as well as your schoolmarm diatribe about "enforcement"

[09:39:21] <spinningCat> it tries to configure odoo package and stucked i cannot install anything else i cannot cancel odoo installation
[09:39:26] <somiaj> Debian has no package named odoo in it, the closes I can find is odoo-14 (14.0.0+dfsg.2-7), which is a different version and has a dfsg tag (has to be modified to get into debian)
[09:39:31] <somiaj> where are you getting this odoo package.
[09:39:38] <somiaj> also what version of debian are you running?
[09:41:00] <spinningCat> here deb http://nightly.odoo.com/13.0/nightly/deb/ ./ in this folder /etc/apt/sources.list.d/odoo.list  i am using debian buster
[09:41:03] *** Joins: ectospasm (~ectospasm@user/ectospasm)
[09:41:44] <somiaj> sounds like you found a bug in their nightly build package, but since this is third party, this is not really a debian problem.
[09:42:02] <spinningCat> okay but i cannot install anything else
[09:42:05] <somiaj> as for the issue, it could be stuck in some loop, unsure, you'll have to invesitate their package
[09:42:19] <spinningCat> is there a way for calcelling "setting up" process?
[09:42:32] <somiaj> Yea, I'm unsure what is the best solution. You could kill the dpkg process, hit ctrl-C, then purge this package
[09:42:49] <somiaj> then afterwards run dpkg --configure -a, or apt -f install to try to fix any remaining unconfigured packages.

[09:44:26] <spinningCat> okay thank you
[09:44:29] <spinningCat> that was weird
[09:44:40] <spinningCat> i just came across such situtation first time
[09:44:51] <spinningCat> i am using debian more than 10 years now
[09:45:20] <somiaj> maybe don't use nightly build packages, they are more likely to have such issues
[09:45:58] <spinningCat> well odoo has community and enterprise edittion. Community comes as nightly build
[09:46:00] <somiaj> I notice that odoo-14 is in bullseye, so maybe once bullseye releases (hopefully end of july) and you upgrade, you can get this sotware without the need for those nightly builds. Though I would maybe use their stable build and not nightly, that way you don't have to chance things
[09:46:06] <spinningCat> i dont have lots of chances there
[09:46:23] <somiaj> ahh they don't have a more stable build,a lso looks like 13 is an older version, since 14 is in bullseye
[09:46:45] <spinningCat> so i am old now
[09:47:00] <spinningCat> how can i upgrade version of os?

[09:49:10] <dpkg> Test failed.
[09:49:15] <somiaj> oh yea
[09:49:25] <somiaj> dpkg: buster->bullseye
[09:49:25] <dpkg> In /etc/apt/sources.list, change "buster" to "bullseye", change "bullseye/updates" to "bullseye-security" on the security line; remove lines like buster-backports, debian-multimedia <dmo>, and other 3rd party repos as they are known to cause issues. apt update && apt upgrade && apt full-upgrade. We're close to release so bullseye isn't a <moving target>. Please report upgrade bugs and serious problems with packages.
[09:49:32] <somiaj> forgot there is a bug with ! and ->
[09:49:51] <somiaj> spinningCat: Make sure to read the release notes, don't just do that without planning and thought

[14:09:32] *** Quits: ignis (~ignisf@user/ignis) (Client Quit)
[14:10:13] <PMT> I have not, but - which Debian version, and does tcpdump or tshark or wireshark on the interface it's listening to show it receiving the request and/or sending a response? Is it actually listening on that interface?
[14:11:41] <ecraven> tcpdump shows the DISCOVER and it also shows the OFFER by another dhcp server. it just seems kea itself doesn't do anything :-/ I've just modified the default configuration file to use the right interface. systemctl status says it is listening, ss -tulpn says kea listens to UDP port 67.
[14:13:02] <ecraven> this is all running inside a Debian 10 container in proxmox, but if tcpdump sees the network traffic (inside the container), it should arrive fine, right?
[14:13:19] <PMT> Does it have logging? If the discover is turning up there, that sounds like a question to ask the DHCP server.

[14:15:06] <ecraven> ah, I just enabled debug logging, and it does indeed give an error message ("No suitable subnet configured for a direct client

[20:11:44] <topoi> jelly: If I understood you (and "!partial downgrade") correctly I'll go through the list (https://paste.debian.net/1200701/) and select the correct versions with aptitude?
[20:12:29] <jelly> topoi, yes, that's one way
[20:12:45] <jelly> using aptitude's interactive terminal UI
[20:13:04] <jelly> you can also use the apt/apt-get/aptitude install package=version syntax

[20:15:17] <jelly> you can also guide it at that prompt, accepting some parts of the proposed solution and refusing others, and telling it to try again
[20:15:47] <jelly> this is probably the one powerful thing that only aptitude can do

[22:00:22] <TheBigK> what should i prefer in dovecot for a lot of mails per mailbox... mbox or maildir... i used to think maildir... but im not sure with dovecot... im new to dovecot
[22:02:03] <sney> I've always used maildir
[22:02:16] <sney> mbox stores all the mails in a single file, right? there are downsides to that 
[22:04:14] <TheBigK> i dont even understand the mbox format in dovecot... i dont know where the mails are in
[22:04:56] <TheBigK> okay ur right... 
[22:05:02] <TheBigK> okay Maildir it is
[22:05:11] <TheBigK> weird that mbox is the default

[22:43:07] <cdhowie> TheBigK: it's a trade-off.  mbox files are more efficiently handled by the filesystem, but deleting a message from the middle requires rewriting the whole file.
[22:43:39] <cdhowie> TheBigK: on the other hand, maildir results in potentially millions of very tiny files, which can cause you to run out of inodes (for filesystems that have inodes, like ext4)
