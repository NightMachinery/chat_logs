[01:26:28] <ProfSimm> I have this issue with most OOP languages that two interfaces with same method name collide.
[01:26:40] <ProfSimm> I don't know how to avoid this without adding a lot of verbosity to an object
[01:26:53] <flakland> namespace, or rename it
[01:27:02] <ProfSimm> That's not a general solution
[01:27:08] <flakland> oh?
[01:27:29] <ProfSimm> Well renaming it is not a solution. I may need to implement two interfaces from different authors.
[01:27:32] <ProfSimm> I can't rename their methods
[01:27:49] <ProfSimm> I wanna solve this deeply in the language semantics themselves
[01:27:50] <sonny> namespace?
[01:28:01] <nomagno> ProfSimm: Well define "collide". It is polymorphism
[01:28:05] <flakland> s/namespace/make a namespace for it/
[01:28:05] <sonny> that's a feature of some common oop languages iirc
[01:28:14] <ProfSimm> It is.
[01:28:26] <sonny> c++ and c# at least
[01:28:27] <ProfSimm> In C# you can type a variable for some interface and you get those methods only.
[01:28:48] <nomagno> The alternative would be not having polymorphism and crashing at compile-time
[01:28:51] <ProfSimm> The issue is you need to explicitly specify types
[01:29:15] <ProfSimm> What other alternatives could we have
[01:29:23] <nomagno> If the authors aren't coordinated you're out of luck
[01:29:36] <nomagno> Same thing with any other language
[01:29:47] <ProfSimm> What if you could design a language from scratch to avoid this
[01:30:04] <sonny> well if it's just names, there are solutions
[01:30:17] <sonny> when you mention polymorphism I'm not sure what that's about
[01:30:38] <nomagno> Well you could explicitly prohibit inheritance and have different sub-objects act as parents
[01:30:40] <nomagno> But it's a BS solution
[01:30:41] <ProfSimm> we could design objects like   object[full.path.to.interface]method()
[01:30:49] <nomagno> ^
[01:30:53] <ProfSimm> But this is terribly verbose

[01:31:32] <nomagno> sonny: if you have two methods with the same name and the interface collide in the same scope, that's more often than not function overloading
[01:32:04] <ProfSimm> nomagno: function overloading would be nice, but what if you have no arguments
[01:32:10] <ProfSimm> or they collide as well
[01:32:13] <flakland> namespace
[01:32:21] <ProfSimm> What do you mean namespace anyway
[01:32:32] <ProfSimm> As I said that can't be a default solution.
[01:32:37] <sonny> nomagno overloading doesn't require an interface?
[01:32:45] <flakland> it was created for this problem
[01:32:50] <nomagno> ProdSimm: then it gives an error, and you have to rewrite the code
[01:32:55] <sonny> nomagno I'm thinking java interface btw
[01:32:56] <ProfSimm> foo.com_java_some_lib_something_something_Interface.method()
[01:33:03] <EdFletcher> create a properly-namespaced facade interface for one of the colliding interfaces 
[01:33:20] <ProfSimm> That's not a solution
[01:33:27] <flakland> lol
[01:33:34] <ProfSimm> Because then it's not the object that implements the interface
[01:33:34] <jackson99> I'm not a big fan of function overloading, especially when combined with default arguments
[01:33:50] <EdFletcher> ProfSimm: huh? 
[01:33:56] <nomagno> sonny: I might have used the term wrong, but if you have a context where an object inherits two methods with the same name, that's either overloading OR an error

[01:35:05] <EdFletcher> ProfSimm: namespacing, not how else to further define it. such as `std` in C++... all modern, proper OOP languages i'm aware of support some kind of namespacing. 
[01:35:07] <sonny> nomagno yeah that's a different term iirc
[01:35:33] <sonny> overloading is the same signature in the same class if I recall
[01:35:37] <ProfSimm> EdFletcher: namespacing typically solves interface name collisions not method collisions
[01:35:54] <ProfSimm> EdFletcher: unless I misunderstand you
[01:35:57] <EdFletcher> and that's why i suggested a facade interface 
[01:36:04] <flakland> where are you reading that, profsimm?
[01:36:16] <DPA> I think go had a different but interesting approach, but I don't remember the details.
[01:36:20] <EdFletcher> wherein you can redefine the colliding method interfaces

[01:37:20] <sonny> which sounds like what you want?
[01:37:40] <sonny> what multiple methods with the same signature?
[01:37:44] <flakland> you can't solve it would you like ambiguity instead of a namespace?
[01:37:44] <sonny> s/what/why/
[01:37:52] <nomagno> ProfSimm: no, because the issue is with code writing uncoordination
[01:38:05] <nomagno> You could have a language where you give a unique identifier to ever library
[01:38:12] <ProfSimm> nomagno: if we require coordination we've failed at the design stage
[01:38:38] <ProfSimm> nomagno: we could, but then we need to type it before every method call or something
[01:38:41] <sonny> two things, namespacing handles names, and this polymorphism thing is confusing
[01:38:47] <flakland> maybe the compiler flips a coin to decide which symbol the programmer meant to use

[01:40:40] <DPA> I just noticed, in C, I need a pointer / member for each interface. But there is no reason a named inerface implementation needs to be implemented that was. It should be possible to have it look the same, but resolve things at compile time.

[01:41:04] <ProfSimm> alternatively you can make a facade that looks like a function, that internally delegates to a long unique name:   function first(list) { return list.NAMESPACE_OF_LIST_INTERFACE.first(); }
[01:41:12] <nomagno> DPA: I don't understand what you mean
[01:41:13] <ProfSimm> Then you can use first(list). and it'll be polymorphic
[01:41:44] <nomagno> That is insanely dynamic, but would work
[01:42:10] <ProfSimm> The issue is I kinda like the order object.method()
[01:42:37] <DPA> nomagno: I mean basically, you have object X, implementing inteface Y. Just give that implementation name Z. THen accessing object.Z.method, make the compiler resolve it at compile time.
[01:43:23] <nomagno> DPA: In C objects can't implement interfaces, at all
[01:43:30] <nomagno> Well, classes can't
[01:43:44] <nomagno> You need a constructor to link the implementations to the interfaces
[01:44:01] <nomagno> That is, the function pointer to the function
[01:44:14] <DPA> I guess it's the same as namespacing. (Sure, C doen't have the feature, but I can always do equivalent things)
[01:44:18] <sonny> yeah so, polymorphism is for inheritance, not overloading
[01:44:59] <nomagno> Overloading is a type of polymorphism
[01:45:22] <sonny> name clash is resolved by using the full name

[04:56:53] <tomathy> html5 is a scripting lang right?
[04:56:59] <EdFletcher> no 
[04:57:02] <EdFletcher> it's a markup language 
[04:57:04] <EdFletcher> ML 
[04:57:06] <[itchyjunk]> is python a browser based scripting language now?
[04:57:10] <gladys__> if my program is interacting with an "API" , is an API a program in and of itself? like separate from the thing my program is ultimately trying to engage with? Or does it just refer to the various "windows" of engagement of a program that other programs must use "for business"
[04:57:16] <gladys__> sorry if thats a stupid question
[04:57:16] <[itchyjunk]> lol
[04:57:26] <Inst> hmmm, okay
[04:57:28] <Decker> gladys__ API is generally more like a library than a program
[04:57:38] <Inst> also fun troll: programming is just code plumbing these days
[04:57:41] <[itchyjunk]> gladys__, API is part of a program
[04:57:52] <Inst> way too many coders, way too many bad coders, unless you're 10x or 100x, you're probably better off trying another career
[04:57:54] <[itchyjunk]> you programm is interacting with another praogarmm via API
[04:57:58] <tomathy> python is a command-based military language for warfare optimisation
[04:57:59] <sonny> Inst the game doesn't seem to work this way
[04:58:15] <gladys__> so the API is the library of functions you must utilize in order to engage your program with another
[04:58:18] <Inst> apparently HTML5 requires javascript for interactive components
[04:58:20] <gladys__> like do_IRQ in the kernel?

[05:08:25] <sonny> flakland c is on the algol tree
[05:08:39] <flakland> my point is, why stop at algol. go back further
[05:08:43] <Inst> I read somewhere that Haskell sort of displaced Lisp as the intellectually aggressive option, i.e, it's now (circa 2013, which isn't now) the preferred language to learn, if you want to not be a "commodity coder" or "code plumber"
[05:08:44] <jkk>  A language is homoiconic if a program written in it can be manipulated  as data using the language, and thus the program's internal  representation can be inferred just by reading the program itself. This  property is often summarized by saying that the language treats "code as  data"
[05:08:58] <sonny> flakland that's really it, algol or lisp
[05:09:04] <[itchyjunk]> lisp folks don't consider lisp to be FP language
[05:09:07] <sonny> or apl tbh

[05:09:10] <flakland> is that "really" it?
[05:09:12] <Inst> but I'll give you guys this, Lisp is alive, has a good community, despite having multiple dialects, and has specific domains where Lisp is preferred and useful

[05:31:47] <sonny> Inst I don't get that question, can you rephrase it?
[05:32:44] <Inst> sonny: I mean that pure or highly pure functional programming (OCaml in the latter case) is sufficiently different from imperative programming that it's supposedly like learning how to code all over again

[05:33:02] <sonny> ocaml is quite imperative
[05:33:20] <Inst> what i'm told on FP discord is that OCaml, unlike, say, Scala, defaults to a functional style
[05:33:23] <sonny> there's like 2 pure languages
[05:33:56] <Inst> and most of my complaints about Haskell are handled in OCaml, but OCaml's problem is that the ecosystem (in terms of jobs, coders, etc) is even worse than Haskell's

[05:35:47] <sonny> learning the functional paradigm isn't the hard if you already know imperative

[05:45:24] <InPhase> Inst: If you want to become an amateur programmer for fun, by all means do so.  It's quite fun.  But there is certainly no surplus of skilled programmers out there in the job market, so don't avoid it from that perspective.

[05:52:07] <Inst> I'm a swing trader. I'd like to become a start-up entrepreneur. I'd rather try to hire 10xers as a rule.
[05:52:22] <Inst> The entire point of interest in Haskell is so that my code isn't useless if I'm not a "good" programmer
[05:52:45] <Inst> It can be refactored trivially and my underlings can fix my mistakes without charging me huge overtime fees.
[05:53:25] <Inst> So yeah, as someone who wants to hire, I'd like to hire 10xers.
[05:53:55] <Inst> Because I believe they exist and are enormously more productive than commodity coders. Because you can hire commodity coders on FiveRR
[05:54:54] <Inst> Some of them charge 10 USD / hour, others charge 100 USD / hr.
[05:56:20] <InPhase> Inst: I'm a pretty effective and generally speedy programmer with 3+ decades of programming, and there are many things I can hammer out 10 times faster than a typical person that sits down to do it, in large part due to more experience doing a thing...  But I find the "10x programmer" notion a bit sketchy, because more broadly speaking programming is not a strictly linear thing.  The complexities of 
[05:56:26] <InPhase> the skills involved and the advantages of experience intertwine in such a way that there is no one who is strictly 10 times faster than some average group across the board of possible tasks.
[05:58:09] <Inst> I've worked minimum wage jobs, I've also taken courses at Ivies, both with an eye toward assessing the caliber of the people I meet.
[05:58:13] <InPhase> Inst: So looking for highly effective programmers is certainly a reasonable thing.  More experienced programmers with more accumulated skill will typically be able to hammer out significantly better quality, more reliable, more maintainable code in a significantly shorter period of time.  But one probably shouldn't use the term "10x programmer" to identify these people nor to seek them out.
[05:58:23] <Inst> I do believe that some people are just way better than others at certain tasks.
[05:58:52] <norias> Inst: I feel like those people would avoid such buzz words. Or maybe that's just me.
[05:59:12] <Inst> InPhase: 10x was originally developed because Rockstar was considered a horrible buzz word.
[05:59:17] <KillerWasp> which's the translation for 'quiero estar ciego'?
[05:59:24] <Inst> I guess the fully PC term is "experienced senior developer"
[05:59:31] <InPhase> Inst: Additionally, it is often not optimal to pack one's staff with purely top skilled experienced programmers.  A good strategy is to get a distribution of experience levels, setup mentoring structures, and distribute tasks of different complexities across these skill levels.
[05:59:41] <KillerWasp> my internet is very broken

This takes your experienced people and multiplies their effectiveness.  The trick is to hire smart junior people who can learn rapidly.

[06:04:40] <norias> wtf do i know, though.
[06:04:40] <InPhase> Inst: Once they start learning, and under guidance, they can be comparably effective.  The reason for this is that a lot of the decisions from experience that make code really good quality can be made quickly and implemented more slowly in comparison.  This is another reason that "10x programmer" doesn't make sense as a label, because that might only be true in a vacuum, and disappears when you 
[06:04:46] <InPhase> actually setup structured teams with experience levels and get people working together.
[06:05:18] <Inst> InPhase: you mean at the architecture and style level, right?
[06:05:25] <InPhase> Inst: Yes.
[06:06:48] <InPhase> Inst: The primary reason I got faster as a programmer as I gained more experience is that I more rapidly saw more ideal architectures and structures for my code before I even started, and with the right architecture and structure everything falls into place more quickly.

[10:07:39] <node1> or values. I'm saying if pre-oder is given then anyone can easily guess in-oder by sorting the pre-order.
[10:07:44] <Decker> ya... are you just consdiering a in-order step function?  
[10:08:28] <Decker> if the nodes in the tree know their parent, it's easy to step greater and step lesser with no recursion

[10:09:45] <Decker> I don't get that second line at all
[10:11:05] <node1> It's simple. If you have given only a pre-order traversal (sequence  of binary tree) Then how would you draw a binary tree with post-order traversal ?

[10:12:46] <node1> What i have visualize that the key is to make it in in-order. In-order is kind of junction where you could easily draw post-order by the help of in-order and pre-order. Otherwise there are no formula exist
[10:12:47] <Decker> preorder is inorder and postorder is just reversed... so step right and stepleft from the leftmost or rightmost

[11:34:22] <flakland> what's that, a timeout on a timeout?
[11:34:23] <Stalevar> What is the best programming language for system programming, such as initial bootloader like grub or lilo?
[11:34:43] <Stalevar> If not assembly
[11:35:19] <flakland> bootloader will require assembly, unless it's some new-age-faux-boot-loader under EFI
[11:35:21] <archie> flakland no, should be a timeout on a socket
[11:36:05] <Stalevar> flakland, first sector is going to be written in asm, of course, but the bootloader usually has more than one sector
[11:36:31] <Stalevar> Also modern bootloader has to support both Classic BIOS and UEFI BIOS
[11:36:43] <flakland> what about EFI
[11:37:17] <Stalevar> So it has to have some common code in one module and then separate modules one of which goes to first sector and other to beginning of uefi file
[11:37:36] <flakland> you keep saying Uefi when you really mean EFI
[11:38:02] <Stalevar> Perhaps

[15:07:26] <DnzAtWrk> making that game in unity or godot would take like 5 times the effort
[15:07:31] <DnzAtWrk> due to the lack of immidiate mode rendering
[15:07:40] <DnzAtWrk> which allows you to render stuff directly to the screen inside the code

[17:31:56] <mrig> mishugana curiously enough it was easier to work when I lived in countries we tend to call third world, because the people are much nicer.

[17:51:08] <DnzAtWrk> thank you Decker

At the core of it is not

[18:23:03] <InPhase> pyzozord: So the long term solution to improving those interactions is to try to shift your perspective of your role in an organization and your role in interacting with others.  When you encounter flaws and defects in the competence or actions of others, try to redirect so that rather than feelings of hostility or aggression arising from this, and look for other perspectives for how you can 
[18:23:09] <InPhase> structure those interactions.  For example, if a coworker repeatedly gets things wrong, you can look at it as an opportunity to advise them in a supportive manner.  If a coworker repeatedly does things that are not optimally friendly, you can regard this as a coworker who is also struggling to figure out how to socially interact in a constructive manner, and respond accordingly as if it is a skill

[19:01:50] <DPA> Async functions kind of need stacks. But with many stacks, I'd have to keep them from colliding. How would I do that efficiently?
[19:01:50] <DPA> Do I just, segment the 48 available bits? Like, 1 bit for if it's stacks or not, 17bit for which stack, 30bits for stack addresses? That'd give me up to 131072 stacks, each up to 1GiB. Not sure if that would be enough, but I wouldn't have to worry about stacks colliding.
[19:01:50] <DPA> Or should I make what I call "stacklets"? Allocate a few pages at a time. If a stack frame doesn't fit the stack, allocate a new one. Always put the previous stack top at the bottom of the stack. It'd be more difficult, and have more overhead. But it'd use the address space more effectively, and I'd not have to make a trade of between stack number vs. size.
[19:02:02] <DPA> Or are there better ways?

[22:08:27] <EdFletcher> godot has games shipping on steam 
[22:08:32] <sonny> nice
[22:09:06] <[itchyjunk]> sonny, you have to define a size of object , the image you load itself doesn't have it, or somesuch i think
[22:09:10] <sonny> ok so that's probably why it's so confusing to me, it has everything to make games but I don't know much about that
[22:09:15] <[itchyjunk]> and you can chose the shape for you object that way

[22:10:42] <[itchyjunk]> amazon came up with opensource game engine?
[22:10:46] <[itchyjunk]> wtf thats news to me
[22:10:53] <sonny> yeah what lol
[22:11:07] <[itchyjunk]> in any case, my code has a bug that i will try to debug but later
[22:11:16] <[itchyjunk]> my head hurts now so can't think code
[22:11:18] <EdFletcher> well they took over one, technically: it was originally called CryEngine. it's what they built New World with. 
[22:11:24] <sonny> games seems to be profitable so I thought about making one :P
[22:11:39] <GeDaMo> You only here about the successful ones

[22:12:30] <EdFletcher> and yeah GeDaMo is correct, for every successful game you hear about there are hundreds if not _thousands_ that languish in unsuccessful obscurity 
[22:12:44] <sonny> I see
[22:12:44] <EdFletcher> GeDaMo: haha yes they have indeed, and New World was very touch-and-go for awhile there too 
[22:12:56] <sonny> so you probably just have to make them in volume or something
[22:13:14] <EdFletcher> even that is no guarantee of success 
[22:13:24] <EdFletcher> tons of shit AAA games come out every year and sell like crap 
[22:13:35] <sonny> yeah, like 2K lol
[22:13:41] <EdFletcher> it's a creative medium: you need to build something engaging and novel 
[22:13:48] <GeDaMo> AAA games cost so much to make, it can be difficult to make a profit on them even if they sell well

[22:14:37] <EdFletcher> they don't

[22:14:51] <sonny> I imagine that would bring the cost down a lot
[22:15:01] <[itchyjunk]> not for AAA
[22:15:07] <[itchyjunk]> their pipelines are funky
[22:15:12] <GeDaMo> I've thought before about making a game using procedurally generated graphics 
[22:15:16] <[itchyjunk]> and it's not AAA if it's shit quality
[22:15:24] <EdFletcher> and honestly graphics quality doesn't directly dictate costs, not the way you think they do 
[22:15:27] <sonny> [itchyjunk] what does that mean?
[22:15:36] <[itchyjunk]> sonny, gameing studios now aquire indie game studios of have "indie" branch
[22:15:39] <EdFletcher> games are extremely broad, that's where the bulk of the work comes in 
[22:15:41] <[itchyjunk]> sonny, what do you think AAA means?
[22:15:47] <sonny> EdFletcher I thought it did since you have to pay for the studio time and stuff
[22:15:55] <pyzozord> GeDaMo: have you heard about .kkreiger?
[22:15:58] <GeDaMo> Yeah
[22:16:02] <[itchyjunk]> if you copy paste some 2 pixel art and write 10 likes of code, it's not AAA title
[22:16:26] <sonny> [itchyjunk] people seem to love playing retro games right now
[22:16:30] <GeDaMo> Have you seen the creature editor on the game Spore?

[22:17:11] <[itchyjunk]> is the issule my lack of understandng of vectors here?
[22:17:17] <[itchyjunk]> why doesn't it go up 3 then down 3?
[22:17:25] <EdFletcher> sonny: it can incur significant costs yes but you always need art & design, and how well you do that is not a function of the visual quality of the game itself. 2d pixel art games can look awesome or terrible, as can flashy 3d games built in Unreal. it depends on how the artists & designer built it.

[22:18:24] <EdFletcher> sonny: and as you note, retro games are a big deal these days. 2d games are easy and fun to write! here's an example i threw together in about a week https://pc.computerpho.be

[22:28:15] <nomagno> [itchyjunk]: Heads up, an indie game is not 10 lines of code with two sprites
[22:28:52] <pyzozord> i put together a big closet alone. It has three doors 2.5m doors with mirrors. This was kind of tough to put it all together alone
[22:29:15] <pyzozord> there was one scary moment where I thought that massive mirror will fall on my face
[22:29:24] <[itchyjunk]> nomagno, that's now what i claimed
[22:29:33] <[itchyjunk]> i said 10 line of code with two sprites isn't AAA game
[22:29:47] <Intelo>  my primary goal is to make the interview non-blocking. no interviewer. should be 100% automatted. Any opensource app like proctoru ?
[22:29:53] <nomagno> That level of code density has yet to be achieved :D
[22:29:56] <[itchyjunk]> Okay, i fundamentally don't understand direction and vector
[22:30:33] <[itchyjunk]> Intelo, you'll have to break down the features you want, find software for each step and glue it together most likely
[22:30:34] <pyzozord> Intelo: how do you want to use that kind of software for interviews if I may ask?
[22:30:37] <[itchyjunk]> since you want to self host
[22:30:58] <nomagno> [itchyjunk]: Well, you're correct.
[22:30:59] <nomagno> My bad
[22:31:49] <Intelo> [itchyjunk] ya.. most probably. any suggestions on these pieces of software? pyzozord automate / schedule interview and let the candidates take it..
[22:32:05] <[itchyjunk]> there is no avoiding looking at docmentation for this shit
[22:32:16] <pyzozord> Intelo: why not just ask candidates to record how they solve the interview?
[22:32:38] <Intelo> pyzozord because if it is not regulated, candidates will record the best retake
[22:33:02] <nomagno> [itchyjunk]: A vector is represented by two points A, B, and a direction A->B / A<-B
[22:33:28] <nomagno> the distance between the two points is the magnitude, and the way the force travels is the direction
[22:33:44] <pyzozord> Intelo: well but that means they will send thir solutions later. I think all you need to do is record when they press "start" button, then show them instruction and then let them upload the screen recording of their solution
[22:34:10] <nomagno> Hence, a vector may also be expressed as a starting point, an absolute direction unit, and a length unit
[22:34:15] <pyzozord> Intelo: if someone uploads their solution in 30 meanwhile another person takes 4h, you know the 4h is a weaker candidate
[22:34:42] <sonny> huh why?
[22:34:43] <[itchyjunk]> nomagno, that understanding isn't helping. i know the mathematican notion of vectors
[22:34:52] <[itchyjunk]> but i can't seem to move up then down concurrently
[22:35:19] <[itchyjunk]> i think the issue is how i am calling the position vector or something
[22:35:23] <[itchyjunk]> tbh idk what the issue is
[22:35:29] <[itchyjunk]> i just know that there is an issue
[22:35:51] <pyzozord> Intelo: but why make record at all, why not use one of the code interview websites? They record every key stroke and you can give any question you want
[22:36:03] <pyzozord> or also choose from a set of standard questions
[22:36:15] <pyzozord> those code interview systems are quite good at what they do

[23:53:41] <ProfSimm> We're all gonna die.
[23:53:55] <[itchyjunk]> There are all sorts of conflicting concepts that come into play when saying "aeging".
[23:54:03] <[itchyjunk]> https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/gut-bacteria-change-as-you-get-older-and-may-accelerate-aging/
[23:54:20] <[itchyjunk]> Both "inbuilt" mechanism and "external" mechanism
[23:54:22] <ProfSimm> [itchyjunk]: your quote directly shows cell death is programmed, i.e. evolved
[23:54:27] <[itchyjunk]> such as entropy and error accumulation.
[23:54:32] <ProfSimm> In the context of a multicellular organism
[23:54:38] <[itchyjunk]> being programmed != evolved to begin with
[23:54:51] <ProfSimm> Tell me what programmed means. God did it? 
[23:54:57] <ProfSimm> I'm fine with that too
[23:55:08] <[itchyjunk]> Evolutionary means there is a selective pressure for it.
[23:55:10] <ProfSimm> Evolved implies "it's that way for a reason"
[23:55:14] <[itchyjunk]> Thats the premise of neo darwinism.
[23:55:21] <ProfSimm> Yes there is. 
[23:55:24] <[itchyjunk]> You're claiming entropy = evolution at this point.
[23:55:39] <[itchyjunk]> No, entropy != evolution, biologically.
[23:55:40] <ProfSimm> If there was no apoptosis or cell suicide, we'd be tumors within few years of birth
[23:55:45] <[itchyjunk]> You need selective pressure to talk about this.
[23:56:06] <[itchyjunk]> A universe evolving and an organism evolving are 2 different concepts of evolution.
[23:56:32] <ProfSimm> You know. You're an excellent energy vampire, I give you that
[23:56:43] <ProfSimm> The real question is why am I talking to you
[23:56:43] <[itchyjunk]> If you don't want to talk, use ignore.
[23:56:48] <[itchyjunk]> Stop making this personal attacks.
