[12:20:09] <arjun> ongy[m]: just wondering whether to double down on haskell or maybe start picking up rust
[12:20:35] <dminuoso> Whatever you prefer. :)
[12:20:38] <riv> id love to understand rust better, but i just find it so difficult with all the borrow stuff
[12:22:13] <arjun> dminuoso: i mean, i have no particular reason to move to rust or whatever, it's just even after a year on haskell, seems like i hardly get it
[12:22:16] <ongy[m]> depends a bit on what you plan to do with your skills
[12:22:38] <dminuoso> arjun: Are you actually writing things in Haskell? Or are you busy trying to learn it?
[12:22:44] <arjun> ongy[m]: yea, that's unclear, i am all-over.
[12:23:11] <arjun> dminuoso: more of the later, less of the former, since i dont really have something to build.
[12:23:21] <dminuoso> arjun: That's your problem right there, then.
[12:23:38] <arjun> nor do i care about making more todo apps and crud api points
[12:23:41] <dminuoso> It's sort of like learning a new language from a book without actually speaking it.
[12:23:44] <ongy[m]> yea, then it's arbitrary. I'd suggest to stay with Haskell for now
[12:23:48] <arjun> i just contribute to ghcup open source
[12:24:09] <dminuoso> Well yeah, if you dont have any problems to solve, then it's hard to really absorb any language.
[12:24:26] <dminuoso> Haskell is just very different, which means you cant simply pick it up in a day like you could Python after having learned say Ruby
[12:24:29] <arjun> dminuoso: i more of know what i dont want rather than what i do want : P
[12:24:46] <arjun> i absolutely hate java and loathe javascript now
[12:25:02] <arjun> indifferent to meh on python
[12:26:09] <arjun> but the problem seems like, whatever language, i don't really have anything that i'd like to build at the moment, sounds weird right ?

[12:27:06] <arjun> ongy[m]: i see.
[12:28:53] <dminuoso> arjun: Then you will have a difficulty picking up any language.
[12:29:10] <dminuoso> Learning Japanese without actually being exposed to Japanese is not really going to improve your proficiency.
[12:29:20] <dminuoso> Same as with any programming langauge
[12:30:01] <ongy[m]> stop it with the hurtful truths D:
[12:30:23] <ongy[m]> The 'rona prevented any ideas of going to Japan to try and force myself to improve language understanding D:
[12:32:26] <arjun> that's not quite right, you can pickup any language you want, just a matter of time, if you have any use for it tho, that's another matter. (i picked up a little german last year, i don't have any german relations, nor do i watch any german media / art, i just wanted to pick a foreign language which is not english)
[12:33:03] <arjun> native fluency is the 20% of the 80-20 thing, you can quite work with the 80% of the way it gets you
[12:33:08] <ongy[m]> und wie gut sprichst du dann deutsch, wenn du es nicht wirklich verwendest?
[12:33:28] <arjun> just speaking, no reading : P
[12:33:56] <ongy[m]> point is, you might get the grammar and rules down, but not the customs and experience/speed to use it properly
[12:34:10] <arjun> sure
[12:34:11] <ongy[m]> unless you are a workaholic and just manage to power the hours into a topic for the fun of learning
[12:34:14] <ongy[m]> I know I'm not
[12:34:43] <ongy[m]> which is why I bought https://kodansha.us/book/read-real-japanese-fiction/ :)

[12:36:05] <dminuoso> arjun: Im not talking about native fluency.
[12:36:17] <dminuoso> arjun: If you are not *exposed* to the language, most people are unable to make much progress.
[12:36:49] <arjun> dminuoso: what did ya guys did when you were sarting out?
[12:37:01] <ongy[m]> followed the lecture :P
[12:37:07] <dminuoso> I wrote various bits and tools.
[12:37:18] <ongy[m]> and then went into projects I wanted to have done
[12:37:32] <dminuoso> At the time, I was using it to solve work problems.
[12:37:44] <arjun> i see
[12:37:47] <ongy[m]> I've written what I still consider the easiest to use libraries for pulseaudio and netlink in Haskell D:
[12:38:08] <arjun> ongy[m]: that's dope
[12:38:14] <ongy[m]> pulseaudio is a huge mess of callbacks. Very easy to use with a collback monad, that makes the code look normal do-notation imperative
[12:38:40] <dminuoso> arjun: Like, I can formally teach you how a loop is implemented in Haskell in a way that you can recite it. But it's unlikely you can solve trivial algorithmic problems formulated with loops.
[12:38:50] <dminuoso> If you have not actually written it yourself.
[12:39:09] <arjun> yea, trivia is endless, you remember what you use often
[12:39:11] <dminuoso> It's probably different if you have sufficient experience or are very talented, but for most people you just have to get a feeling for it.
[12:39:50] <dminuoso> Some bits are certainly going to help a lot, like if you know SML then your entry in Haskell is going to be much easier.
[12:40:07] <dminuoso> Simply because you've already been exposed to various constructs and ideas with a similar syntax style

[12:40:20] <dminuoso> But other than that, practice helps most.
[12:40:42] <arjun> i look at programming as a useful skill to have and programming languages as tools (say a hammer). now i don't have any particular use for a hammer at the moment, but i'd still like to learn how to use the hammer properly and the works for when i do have a nail to fucking smash
[12:40:54] <dminuoso> Arguably, trying to do something silly like implementing a calculator or writing simple quality-of-life command line tools for organizing your files, is going to help a lot more than reading guides for a year

[12:41:13] <ongy[m]> the issue with that analogy is the complexity of your hammer
[12:41:32] <ongy[m]> it's not the tool you pick up and smash. It's the industrial vehicle variant that'll decapitate your colleague if you aren't careful
[12:41:45] <arjun> but you're right tho, no ammount of reading about how to swing a hammer would make you learn than the actuall feeling and feedback of actually swinging a hammer
[12:41:57] <dminuoso> arjun: Right. And more to the point, swinging the hammer is not complicated.
[12:42:03] <dminuoso> You do it a few times and rapidly pick up experience
[12:42:06] <dminuoso> Programming is the same.,
[12:42:46] <arjun> yea, no, i've been programming a little while and imperative languages as easy as cakes
[12:42:48] <dminuoso> My personal recommendation is to just create your own problems if you dont have them
[12:42:59] <arjun> haskell's just giving me grief
[12:43:04] <dminuoso> Well
[12:43:14] <dminuoso> Treat Haskell as learning from anew.
[12:43:34] <arahael> Is *complaining* about haskell offtopic here, or allowed? :)
[12:43:45] <dminuoso> We used to have #haskell-offtopic-offtopic.
[12:43:47] <dminuoso> :p
[12:43:59] <ongy[m]> offtopic spillover
[12:44:06] <lortabac> we should create #haskell-rants
[12:44:07] <ongy[m]> was -blah ever moved?
[12:44:16] <arahael> dminuoso: Was that on the network now known as the Josedion empire or something? :)

[12:45:07] *** Joins: merijn (~merijn@83-160-49-249.ip.xs4all.nl)
[12:45:18] <arahael> Ok, that's too complex. I think I might head back to #haskell.
[12:45:21] <dminuoso> arjun: Accepting that learning Haskell requires unlearning old habits, unlearning vocabulary, and learning problems as if you have never programmed before, this is key.
[12:45:50] <dminuoso> arjun: Like some of the problems people face is that accepting what we name "function" or "variable" is distinctly different from what Python or many other traditional languages would have you believe.
[12:46:50] <dminuoso> Which is in part why "how do I write a python function as a haskell function" quickly fails, simply because you might end up trying to compare things that are simply different.
[12:47:06] <dminuoso> And in addition its not helpful, because you end up trying to write Python in Haskell.
[12:48:08] <dminuoso> Pretend you know nothing about programming, look at Haskell, and start solving problems without thinking "how would I do this in <language-xyz>". I think that's the universal road to success for people who have had a long traditional/imperative background.
[12:48:37] <arjun> dminuoso: it's the opposite, i end up writing haskell in python these days
[12:48:41] <zincy> With natural languages we instinctively don't learn through translation
[12:48:58] <riv> i was unable to write haskell in python and had to just rewrite my thing in haskell recently D:
[12:49:09] <zincy> riv: haha
[12:49:15] <dminuoso> zincy: Hah, Germans beg to differ. It's almost like a national sport to take a German phrase, translate word-by-word into English, and utter some gibberish.
[12:49:23] <arjun> and i cringe everytime i have to write a class and make a object, so much state, ew.
[12:50:24] <dminuoso> arjun: Curious, how do you do that if you haven't really learned Haskell?
[12:50:44] <arjun> i have been on and off at it for a year+
[12:50:46] <dminuoso> Though I must admit, when I was learning Haskell, I was wild and tried to copy so many ideas into Ruby, which is what I was doing back then.
[12:50:56] <dminuoso> I thought it was a smart thing and would improve my ruby life so much.
[12:51:02] <dminuoso> Some painful lessons had to be learned..
[12:51:15] <arjun> i know the basics alright, monad transformer and type level fuckery is mumbo-jumbo to me atm tho
[12:51:27] <zincy> dminuoso: Do you recommend forcing Haskell thinking into Ruby/JS etc?
[12:51:53] <zincy> Or are you better to "respect" the language design
[12:52:00] <dminuoso> I dont think forcing ideas from one language into another is often a good idea.
[12:52:01] <arjun> i think i'll stick with haskell for now, thanks guys
[12:52:16] <arjun> not like a need a job or anything :p
[12:52:21] <zincy> dminuoso: Interesting, you just saved a million future colleagues from screaming
[12:52:35] <dminuoso> zincy: Many things in Haskell only work well because we have full blown ADTs or a good type system
[12:52:50] <zincy> So is it kind of 80/20 principle
[12:53:04] <zincy> Like if you are using Typescript just fit in what isn't too much effort 
[12:53:07] <dminuoso> Like partial.lenses in JavaScript is a fine library, but if you make the slightest mistake, be ready for random gibberish runtime errors you cant decipher in the slightest.
[12:53:28] <zincy> Yeah so lenses are a bad idea in JS
[12:53:35] <dminuoso> Well, they are still a great tool
[12:53:37] <arjun> JS is a bad idea in JS
[12:53:55] <dminuoso> Especially in the web development, say when you do something like a react eventloop over some global state (like with redux)
[12:54:03] <dminuoso> When you have this big honking deeply nested state
[12:54:09] <dminuoso> partial.lenses is the most sane way to interact with it
[12:54:21] <dminuoso> But it's very frustrating to use due to the lack of a type system
[12:54:31] <arjun> dminuoso: immutable data structures and dots ftw
[12:54:42] <zincy> So with typescript would you use lenses for web dev?
[12:55:03] <dminuoso> It would require some creativity to make something work with typescript in the sense of `optics`
[12:55:03] <zincy> I'm just wondering where the line is 
[12:55:17] <dminuoso> zincy: But if we had something akin to `optics`, yes I would.
[12:55:26] <arjun> yea, what's the opinion on purescript vs typescript these days?
[12:55:40] <dminuoso> Different tools for different problems.
[12:56:04] <zincy> https://github.com/gcanti/monocle-ts
[12:56:19] <arjun> i asked what do haskell people do for frontend ? purescript seemed the popular choice
[12:56:27] <dminuoso> zincy: yeah that library is too limiting for me.
[12:56:33] <arjun> and was asked not to go the entire ghcjs way
[12:56:43] <dminuoso> zincy: some of the problems you will have with typescript, is that you dont have the power to talk about compositionality.
[12:56:45] <dminuoso> LIke
[12:57:05] <dminuoso> If you compose a Prism with a Lens, does your type system give a guaranteed way to putting out an (Affine) Traversal?
[12:57:14] <lortabac> arjun: also Elm
[12:57:27] <arjun> yea, and that, lortabac 
[12:57:30] <dminuoso> arjun: I simply dont do a frontend.
[12:57:32] <dminuoso> :p
[12:57:53] <arjun> dminuoso: like i don't do databases : P
[12:57:53] <zincy> dminuoso: So ts library is useful enough atm. Do you think Typescript just cannot support optics done right?
[12:58:10] <dminuoso> zincy: I dont know typescript well enough to make a statemant about it.
[12:58:22] <dminuoso> But given that I know how optics is implemented, I doubt it can get even half the way.
[12:58:56] <zincy> dminuoso: Yeah lens implentation in Haskell looks like a beast
[12:59:02] <zincy> I bet it would be instructive to really understand it
[12:59:15] <dminuoso> lens is not complicated really
[12:59:17] <dminuoso> neither is optics
[12:59:26] <zincy> Seems like just learning the implementation of a haskell libary can teach you a lot of interesting orthoganal concepts
[12:59:39] <zincy> oh ok
[12:59:46] <dminuoso> lens/optics are very interesting in that they are very puristic and mathematically beautiful solutions.
[13:00:17] <zincy> What fields of maths do optics straddle
[13:00:53] <arjun> i think they are category-theory adjacents ?
[13:01:56] <dminuoso> zincy: Well, so optics uses profunctor optics, and the cool bit is that *all* of them have a uniform shape
[13:02:34] <dminuoso> And composing ends up just adding constraints, which given subsumption leads to new constraints. So optic types are identified just by constraints
[13:02:43] <dminuoso> (in lens the story is slightly more complicated for a variety of reasons)(
[13:03:30] <zincy> "An optic is a first-class, composable notion of substructure. As a highly abstract concept, the idea"
[13:03:50] <dminuoso> So `Strong` gives you what we call a lens, `Choice` gives you a prism, `Choice` and `Strong` implies `Visiting`, which gives you an AffineTraversal
[13:03:51] <zincy> So is the underlying abstract concept the same for both lens and optics approaches
[13:03:52] <dminuoso> etc
[13:04:15] <dminuoso> zincy: Yes. optics just uses a profunctor representation, lens uses a mix of VL-style and profunctors
[13:04:21] <merijn> Man...sometimes I'm sad I'll never be as good a Haskell shitposter as Vanessa...
[13:05:02] <merijn> http://vmchale.com/static/pl_2021.html
[13:05:33] <arjun> *reluctantly clicks link, hoping to not be rick-colled*
[13:05:36] <arjun> rolled**
[13:05:40] <zincy> dminuoso: Cool. Did you find learning category theory useful/interesting? I feel like a lot of people into optics like CT
[13:05:57] <dminuoso> Interesting yes, useful no.
[13:06:19] <dminuoso> zincy: Dunno, I think actually that beginners have a simpler time with optics than with lens.
[13:06:39] <arjun> merijn: "- [ ] You can't write a compiler backend without LLVM" OUCH
[13:07:14] <zincy> dminuoso: What theoretical topics did you find both interesting and useful for thinking about programming?
[13:07:35] <dminuoso> zincy: In category theory?
[13:07:44] <zincy> Just generally
[13:07:53] <dminuoso> Algebra gives you the most bang for your buck.
[13:07:57] <zincy> As in abstract algebra, type theory etc
[13:08:15] <zincy> Oh cool I planned to dip my toe into Algebra
[13:08:20] <dminuoso> Everything else greatly depends on your experience, field of work and itnerest.
[13:08:48] <zincy> So Algebra is analagous to Calculus in the context of coding
[13:09:07] <dminuoso> Not sure what the analogy tried to depict
[13:09:37] <zincy> In a maths degree analysis is the first thing you usually do and the pathways split after that
[13:10:48] <zincy> Did you find diminishing returns for the depth of algebra you did?
[13:10:57] <zincy> In terms of usefulness for coding
[13:12:08] <dminuoso> It's hard to put this into numbers.
[13:12:26] <dminuoso> I dont regret my time if that's what you're asking
[13:12:43] <zincy> Ok cool
[13:13:05] <zincy> I'm learning topology atm.
[13:13:43] <zincy> Heard there are some applications to PL with homotopy theory etc
[13:14:49] <dminuoso> At the end I think some programmers could do with learning more formalisms.
[13:15:11] <dminuoso> There's a general lack of rigor amongst modern programmers
[13:15:24] <zincy> 100%
[13:25:44] <lortabac> I think having "code monkeys" in a team is not bad, as long as you also have someone who is able to reason about the problems at a higher level
[13:26:50] <lortabac> also, it's important to give people the right tasks according to their skills
[13:28:03] <lortabac> I've seen too many senior architects with impressive CVs and salaries being assigned trivial tasks
[13:28:16] <lortabac> and viceversa
[13:36:12] <zincy> "I think having "code monkeys" in a team is not bad" Yes, not ideal though probably
[13:49:57] <ongy[m]> depends on structure and type of tasks I'd say
[13:50:47] <ongy[m]> also, what exactly we term code monkey. But I'd love to have someone that does the typing, of repetitive stuff or just integrates things we know how to integrate
[13:54:15] <zincy> Yeah
[13:54:50] <zincy> Anyone got any good non-fiction book recommendations?
[13:55:08] <zincy> I recently read The Information by James Gleick and really enjoyed it
[13:57:05] <arjun> i tried pickin up Asimov's foundation after watching the recent series
[13:57:25] <arjun> the protagonist is a male, tranied mathematician in the book
[13:57:45] <arjun> exactly the oposite in the series
[14:02:42] <merijn> Welp
[14:02:54] <merijn> This week is starting off well with some cursed debugging
[14:03:30] <merijn> Specifically 'hah, python's subprocess module behaves slightly differently in how it closes FDs between macOS and linux'
[14:06:07] <zincy> arjun: Oh cool thanks
[14:08:55] <merijn> oh god...they don't use posix_spawn when close_fds is enabled...
[14:09:37] <arjun> merijn: what are FD's ?
[14:12:00] <arjun> also, if you don't mind reading manga, i've been enjoying Dr. Stone
[14:12:27] <geekosaur> file descriptors, the underlying mechanism for reading and writing from files or subprocesses on unix-like operating systems
[14:14:02] <merijn> arjun: file descriptors
[14:14:07] <merijn> FML
[14:14:12] <merijn> cpython uses fork

[22:08:40] <tomsmeding> re:survey but also in general: are phd students considered "students"? I'm always confused
[22:21:06] <monochrom> I think yes.
[22:22:12] <monochrom> Well, that's what I had always classified myself when I was a PhD student, when e.g. going to COMDEX and filling out their forms.
[22:23:08] <monochrom> "I'm a student and the organization is U of Toronto and no I don't make purchase decisions"
[22:23:54] <monochrom> That earned me a badge with a colour that stood for "this person doesn't make purchase decisions" so all the exhibitors don't have to waste their time :)
[22:24:39] <monochrom> Fortunately, most exhibitors were still happy to answer my curiosity questions.
[22:25:04] <monochrom> And in good years, happy to give me the same freebies they gave to everyone else.
[22:25:13] <tomsmeding> yay that colour
[22:25:22] <monochrom> I got a Caldera rubber penguin this way :)
[22:25:23] <davean> tomsmeding: I never thought anyone might not classify them as students
[22:26:23] <tomsmeding> here in NL it's kind of ambiguous, because we 1. get a salary, 2. don't get a government student loan anymore, 3. don't have free public transport anymore (which is called "student public transport")
[22:26:35] <monochrom> Some universities' payroll systems classify PhD students as research/lab assistants.
[22:27:05] <monochrom> Yeah, that. It's called "salary" so it now doesn't sound very student-like.
[22:27:53] <tomsmeding> basically all the student perks stop :p
[22:28:31] <monochrom> But in my city PhD students still qualify for student fee in public transport.
[22:28:39] <tomsmeding> also the Dutch traditional name for a PhD is an "assistant in training", literally translated, which is guess similar to what monochrom said
[22:28:46] <tomsmeding> they do? jealous
[22:29:32] <monochrom> and qualify for that International Student Travel thingy's airplane discount, train discount, etc.
[22:30:08] <monochrom> Well, on the down side, students still pay a fee, it is not free, not for anyone above age 12.
[22:30:25] <monochrom> And even the "free for below age 12" thing was recent.
[22:30:41] <tomsmeding> monochrom: that Caldera penguin needs picture for proof
[22:31:18] <tomsmeding> yeah no fee for me, university pays me instead
[22:31:27] <tomsmeding> okaya so NL is just being weird here

[22:33:12] <davean> tomsmeding: why wouldn't a student get a salary?
[22:34:41] <tomsmeding> monochrom: yay pinguins! Also lol kermit and windows XP ?!
[22:35:08] <monochrom> That's not kermit, it's keroppi.
[22:35:12] <tomsmeding> davean: as a bachelor and master student, I paid roughly 2000 euros per year to study, didn't get nothing from them.
[22:35:21] <tomsmeding> well, aside from free public transport and a cheap government loan
[22:35:31] <monochrom> The picture was taken a long time ago in XP time.
[22:35:34] <tomsmeding> monochrom: beg your pardon
[22:35:40] <tomsmeding> ah
[22:36:05] <tomsmeding> ah I could have read that from the filename lol
[22:36:22] <davean> tomsmeding: I ended up paid for a period of my undergrad
[22:36:35] <davean> but only once I was into reasearch and had actual projects going
[22:36:58] <monochrom> I do have a baby kermit from McDonald's
[22:37:03] <tomsmeding> yeah, if you have an actual function as research assistant, you can sometimes get paid for that here as well. But theses don't count.
[22:37:08] <tomsmeding> <3
[22:37:46] <monochrom> Oh dart I forgot to post this picture yesterday!  ObHalloween pic: pumpkin catmorphism: https://www.vex.net/~trebla/photo/unorganized/pumpkin-catmorphism.jpg
[22:39:11] <davean> tomsmeding: So aren't PhD students basicly paid on the same basis?
[22:40:21] <tomsmeding> monochrom: I'm not quite sure how the category theory joke works there, but fancy halloween penguins :p
[22:40:45] <monochrom> uh those are cats...
[22:41:08] <tomsmeding> davean: I guess? though PhD students being paid is run of the mill, and a BSc/MSc student getting paid for research-assistant work is very sporadic and non-standard
[22:41:21] <tomsmeding> monochrom: I was talking about the ones on the left of the cats
[22:41:29] <tomsmeding> though I'm not 100% sure those are supposed to be penguins
[22:41:30] <davean> tomsmeding: right, but at leasy my cynical take is that they started paying me as soon as they respected me
[22:41:31] <monochrom> Ah.
[22:41:40] <davean> tomsmeding: The difference seemign to be who they take for a category?

[22:43:55] <tomsmeding> :)
[22:45:34] <monochrom> I have a feeling that the profs understand student financial hardship and want to channel some of their own research grant into research assistant salaries whenever they find good students.
[22:45:45] <monochrom> and perhaps s/understand/sympathize/
[22:46:23] <[exa]> let's assign the probability to the event of "finding a good student" to understand why that is hard.
