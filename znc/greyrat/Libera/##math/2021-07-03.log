[00:00:35] <buster> tusko, in the first section (the proposition) there seems to be some confusion about which variables are bound and which free
[00:01:06] <buster> the left side has n as a bound variable, so it's 'just a number' and doesn't depend on something called n

[00:01:43] <buster> but then the right side is a function of n, and it says "n in N" afterwards. i'm left unsure what's being said.

[00:07:38] <[itchyjunk]> I am watching a random youtube video that brought up knapsack problem and said it's equivalent to P vs NP problem. but i don't see a relation between picking items from a bag and P vs NP
[00:10:20] <Plazma> it's more than about just picking items from a bag but putting them back in, and their respective size and values
[00:11:07] <[itchyjunk]> well sure, problem is to find optimal solution to minimize weight and maximize value
[00:12:04] <Plazma> it's considered NP because technically there is no polynomial time solution to solve it, though i think there are some that are pseudo or some otehr variant they came up with

[00:37:03] <cherim> I already said that yesterday so maybe there is no sense in repeating
[00:37:38] <cherim> When a proof is a sequence of statements A;B;C it is a shorthand for (context)=>A; (context, A)=>B; (context, A, B)=>C etc.
[00:38:10] <cherim> So formally this makes no sense

[00:38:28] <buster> and even informally, it's confusing
[00:38:49] <cherim> "Now observe that 1+...<=1+k/(k+1)"
[00:39:07] <cherim> One can't observe that, and it's not what you mean
[00:39:27] <cherim> You spend time proving this below, so don't claim this before you are ready
[00:39:41] <cherim> There are several ways to fix
[00:40:08] <cherim> 1) You can reverse the sequence of formulae. Start from bottom (which is indeed obvious) and go up
[00:41:00] <cherim> This is the standard way, and most proofs in textbooks are of this sort. People sometimes wonder where the first mysterious (but obviously true) formula came from, but they know that it's a result of reversing anyway

[00:41:40] <cherim> 2) You can make everything one statement with <=> connective, i.e. "A<=>B<=>C, where C is obviously true for all n"
[00:42:48] <cherim> 3) You can transform LHS only, not the inequality. It's almost what you do in "LHS=", although that line is simply wrong with "="  (it's not equal by induction hypothesis, only <=)
[00:43:35] <cherim> As is, there is some weird mix of 1)-3) plus the original broken reversed logic in the end

[01:46:26] <dila> isn't "push forward" a category theory thing
[01:46:53] <taeaad> Yes, but it has nothing to do with pushing.
[01:47:18] <dila> people like physical analogies in math it seems
[01:47:21] <dila> "lifting" .etc
[01:47:33] <buster> heh yeah. another metaphor. here we're literally pushing.
[01:47:57] <taeaad> It vaguely has something to do with forward—the arrows move out from an object and end up in an object. The colimit is the end object.
[01:48:07] <taeaad> In a pullback the start object is the limit.
[01:48:07] <DynV> it's also an economic term, commonly known as ponzy.

[01:51:46] <DynV> I reposted the question 3 mins ago
[01:52:16] <taeaad> dila: It's called "Fourier Theory" :P
[01:52:43] <dila> are you sure? i was hoping that the correct treatment would be in an algebraic setting
[01:53:20] <taeaad> The terms of a Fourier series are gears, but it's more a way of explaining Fourier Series than a treatment of gears.
[01:53:39] <taeaad> 3 Blue 1 Brown likes using it to explain Fourier Series.

[01:54:16] <taeaad> A sine or cosine wave can be drawn by a rolling circle, which is what the concept of using "gears" for it is based on.

[02:01:59] <taeaad> Machine learning is not unlike actuarial science, but it may be easier since you use code libraries.
[02:02:11] <taeaad> It's all just weaponised mathematics :P

[02:04:04] <johnkeats6> :P
[02:04:11] <taeaad> There are also a lot of design redundancy in machine learning. But bad redudancy rather than good redundancy. As an example, gradient boosted decision trees are still trees. But they seem to be much bigger and complicated than a minimal representation thereof. I don't have a citation for this, but that was my experience when trying to visualise the trees.
[02:04:12] <buster> stamp collecting
[02:05:46] <johnkeats6> so what's the maximum value over l >= 0 of [l W(y/2l) (W(y/2l) + 2)]/y for a fixed y > 0 where W is the lambert function?
[02:06:02] <taeaad> I suspect that I can reorganise the trees to 1) completely recover the bigger tree and 2) to approximate the tree and be way smaller. The other problem is that they are decision trees and yet we don't know the decisions that branch. And then, oddly, we use them as though we pretend to know what "decision" they are recommending.

[02:09:10] <johnkeats6> buster, i find it useful to know about the physical ideas aside frm just studying the math of qft. for that i rather like the recent Particle Physics notes by Tong, and Griffith's book Introduction to Elementary Particles

[03:38:14] <cherim> Build a graph G where i and j are joined with an edge if you ever used the ij swap. If there are fewer swaps than cycles, G has more connected components than the permutation has cycles. Hence some cycle contains entries from different components.
[03:38:51] <cherim> But you can emulate any power of the permutation with the same swaps, including the power that moves elements between these two components

[05:29:06] <harwiltz> Hello all. This is probably a really dumb question, but it's been driving me nuts. My research has lead me to a PDE of the form f_t(t, x) = -f_x(t, x), where e.g. f_t is the partial derivative of f wrt t. Now I really want to write a PDE in terms of another variable y, where x = g(t, y). If the original PDE is satisfied, is f_t(t, g(t, y)) = -f_x(t, g(t, y)) also satisfied?
[05:29:25] <harwiltz> Intuitively I think "no", because of chain rule terms, but I keep confusing myself.

[15:28:20] <rubiksdream> i kinda dislike the treatment of conditional distributions in statistics courses, particularly how they are so blatant about 'justifying' things with bayes rule
[15:29:31] <rubiksdream> like its not normally justified why writing p(Y = y | X =x) = p_{XY}(X=x,Y=y) / p(x) is appropriate
[15:30:16] <int-e> It's the definition of a conditional probability.
[15:30:32] <rubiksdream> no i mean
[15:30:48] <rubiksdream> f_{Y|X}(y|x) = f_{X,Y}(x,y)/f_X(x)
[15:30:57] <rubiksdream> the conditional density
[15:31:05] <rubiksdream> for continuous random variables
[15:31:16] <rubiksdream> for discrete random variables sure one can just apply bayes
[15:31:33] <rubiksdream> but in the continuous case to actually show that f_{Y|X}(y|x) is that quotient requires a bit more work
[15:32:14] <rubiksdream> and in the general case it requires a definition of conditional probability for continuous random variables
[15:32:23] <rubiksdream> which requires a definition of conditional expectation

[16:15:14] <riv> of course any fixed compression algorithm is just an approximation of the (kolmogorov) entropy, i will not always attain the limit
[16:15:38] <riv> and with something very basic like RLE, having A doesn't even help, even if its similar to B
[16:16:26] <int-e> or with something like BWT (basis of bzip) which works on the whole input at once
[16:16:27] <riv> you might be interested in facebook zst

[16:17:30] <int-e> ...what a useless use of unicode
[16:17:36] <riv> https://github.com/facebook/zstd it has training sets that let it compress certain types of data really well. e.g. you could train it on source code and it may compress source code very well as long as compressors and decompressors have that trained data set
[16:17:36] *** Quits: nate1 (~nate@108-233-125-227.lightspeed.sntcca.sbcglobal.net) (Ping timeout: 272 seconds)
[16:18:11] <riv> that's really interesting that bwt doesn't benefit from shared data in this way
[16:18:25] <oj> In my case, there's no sensible way to train a compressor on the data
[16:18:28] <oj> unfortunately
[16:18:54] <riv> what do you mean? why not?
[16:19:09] <oj> it's floating point data
[16:19:31] <riv> is lossy ok in this case?
[16:19:40] <oj> I would prefer lossless
[16:19:50] <riv> just treat it as a binary string then
[16:19:51] <oj> lossy is ok to within floating point error
[16:19:53] <oj> yeah
[16:20:10] <oj> since A and B should be similar
[16:20:18] <oj> my idea was to use XOR to combine them
[16:20:35] <oj> and hope that there's a lot of zeros in the resulting string
[16:20:40] <oj> which should then compress nicely
[16:20:52] <int-e> oj: that will probably be awful unless A and B are perfectly aligned
[16:21:13] <int-e> (say, follow the same fixed binary format)
[16:21:24] <oj> they do follow the same format
[16:22:04] <oj> a floating point number in A at position k is the same as the floating point number in B at position k, but after an operation
[16:22:04] <riv> xor wont be good
[16:22:12] <oj> xor is fast
[16:22:18] <riv> something to consider, if A is "structured" and B is "random", A xor B is "random"
[16:22:29] <oj> both A and B are structured
[16:22:32] <oj> in the same way
[16:22:45] <int-e> then sure, why not... data compression has quite a few ad-hoc tricks for specific kinds of data
[16:22:52] <oj> B[k] = A[k] + f(A)
[16:23:08] <riv> subtract, don't xor
[16:23:23] <oj> subtraction with floating points is lossy
[16:23:28] <oj> that's the issue
[16:23:29] <riv> i didn't know that
[16:24:01] <oj> 0.1f + 0.2f != 0.3f
[16:24:04] <int-e> (one of the most stupid ones I know of is... scanning through executable code looking for things that appear to be relative addresses, and making them absolute, so that more substrings repeat (calls to the same address))
[16:24:15] <riv> (assuming f(A) is more likely to be compressible than A,B)
[16:24:23] <riv> oj, that doesn't imply floating point subtraction is lossy
[16:24:32] <riv> that's about decimal vs binary conversion
[16:24:36] <oj> it does
[16:24:40] <riv> no it doesn't
[16:24:58] <oj> let's say x = 0.3, and y = x - 0.1
[16:25:05] <oj> then x+ 0.1 != y
[16:25:11] <oj> you can't recover y from x anymore
[16:25:17] <oj> *x from y
[16:26:15] <oj> this is why, when programming, you generally can't compare equality between floating point numbers and expect a sane result
[16:26:58] <oj> equality is usually tested with x + d > y && x - d < y => x = y
[16:27:09] <oj> where d is a small number
[16:29:11] <oj> To go back to my initial point, if there is a sensible measure for the "information redundancy" between A and B, then that would give theoretical support for the idea
[16:29:34] <oj> and I wouldn't have to test potentially bad schemes
[16:29:58] <oj> then I could separately evaluate the merit of using the shared data for compression and the scheme used to perform the compression
[16:31:08] <riv> https://ideone.com/56eGQv I tested subtraction and they are 1 bit different

[19:17:56] <d3x0r> so... the definition of rotation is that the point rotated is still the same distance from either the axis of rotation or origin... If there were a 4D (XYZW) rotation, then rotating around X should cause changes in Y, Z and W; but then what's normally just a change in yz around a circle/cylinder, would leave W unchanged... but since the total distance would have to be the same, any additional/difference in W would have to additionally shift

[19:20:05] <d3x0r> so maybe rotation can only apply to a plane, or a translation of one axis toward another; But then the basic rule that any combination of rotations can be resolved into a single axis breaks too... in 4D you'd have 6 coordinates, for each of the orthagonal planes
[19:20:41] <hanif> i think the '-1' in 'n-1' is only if the sequence is 1-indexed. i guess the 'n-1' can be interpreted as how many terms a_n is from the starting one
[19:21:40] <diophantoz> i see
[19:21:44] <hanif> then a_6 is 6 terms from a_0. but a_6 is 5 terms from a_0. either way, i'd say it is better to derive the formula yourself than use an existing one

[19:54:16] <laurus> I spent quite a lot of time figuring out recently that the change of basis transformation is really just the identity transformation.
[19:54:24] <laurus> However, the change of basis _matrix_ is not the identity matrix
[19:55:14] <laurus> So for S the change of basis transform, T = S^{-1} T S because S is Id. And also the matrix version of that formula works if you use the correct bases
[19:55:44] <laurus> But, for S an isomorphism _not_ the identity transformation, we _don't_ have T = S^{-1} T S even though the matrix formula would have equality. Is this correct?

[20:00:07] <tolarz> >  we _don't_ have T = S⁻¹ T S
[20:00:13] <Cale> Hmm... there's something uncomfortable with saying that a change of basis transformation is the identity transformation. In a sense it is, and a change of basis matrix is always what you get by writing out the matrix of an identity transformation with respect to the two bases... but it's often going to be misleading to say that any change of basis is the identity.
[20:00:21] <tolarz> i agree, but often we think of T and S⁻¹TS as equivalent
[20:00:31] <tolarz> Thus, often we consider the original space quotiened out by that.
[20:00:39] <tolarz> (in group theory terms: we think of the Abelianization of the group instead)
[20:00:47] <laurus> Cale: I am writing it up in LaTeX and will show you very briefly
[20:01:07] <tolarz> If you say that two matrices are equal (but say they accept inputs over different bases),
[20:01:10] <tolarz> you are precisely doing this quotiening
[20:01:34] <Cale> Like, if we're going to say that, on the face of it, we're saying that every invertible linear transformation is the identity, which is not true.

[20:01:47] <buster> laurus, no, it's not correct. if S is in the centralizer of T (that is, ST=TS) then S⁻¹TS=T. and it's not true in general that the centralizer of T is {1}. for example, the centre of GL(V) is a subset of the centralizer.

[20:47:49] <motle> Cale: thats the same method...
[20:47:58] <laurus> cherim: That is quite plausible

[20:48:36] <motle> oh right, yeah, as long as the average isnt the 0 vector the transformation to obtain the angle should work
[20:49:05] <motle> it just seems strange there isnt a way to do that without transforming to cartesian coords first
[20:49:24] <motle> something to do with the circle being periodic seems to mess up the averaging process
[20:49:36] <Cale> You could also cut the circle at an arbitrary point, and take an average of the angles (which are just real numbers then), but that'll have a pretty bad bias.
[20:49:41] <motle> idk if complex numbers would be better..

[20:50:10] <Cale> This is kind of a fundamental "what do you really mean?" sort of problem
[20:50:18] <motle> Cale: the problem with averaging the angles is that on either side of the negative x axis are +/- pi
[20:50:41] <motle> in the limit these should induce the same change on being averaged with, but they differ by 2pi
[20:51:12] <Cale> Right, so if you make a cut there, points immediately on either side of the cut will average to 0
[20:51:22] <Cale> which is on the opposite side of the circle, unintuitively
[20:52:01] <motle> they can be shifted eg so everything lies in the same half circle, but the choice of where on the circle to place this, eg in the upper half plane, is arbitrary, and has the same sensitivity to points moving continuously over the dividing line making a discontinuous change in the average
[20:52:41] <motle> i cant seem to get round that without transforming to cartesian coords to perform the average
[20:53:01] <motle> im wondering if thats something fundamental to do with complex numbers having 2 components like 2d vectors
[20:53:23] <motle> ie, does it make sense that i would have to transform to a 2 component representation, and so i should just stop worrying
[20:53:46] *** Quits: bosspotato (~bosspotat@user/bosspotato) (Ping timeout: 258 seconds)
[20:54:21] <Cale> I mean, even the Cartesian thing is kind of arbitrary as well, right?
[20:54:24] <motle> something to do with the arbitrary choice of windowing of a periodic infinite range to a finite domain

[20:55:52] <Cale> So it's somewhat natural
[20:56:25] <motle> and then after averaging we can reproject to get a vector of the right radial length
[20:56:33] <motle> it does seem expensive

[20:57:43] <motle> i was wondering if using complex numbers would somehow by being the correct 2 vector for the job, might make some savings
[20:57:47] <Cale> Well, why are you averaging points on a circle in the first place?
[20:59:00] <motle> i have a set of samples and a new sample with vectors from the samples to this new point, all the vectors are represented in polar coords and im trying to average them
[20:59:44] <motle> to get the average angle as measured against the set of existing sample points
[20:59:47] <Cale> Oh, yeah, convert them all to Cartesian coordinates before averaging.
[21:00:24] <motle> so i just want the polar representation of the cartesian average instead of the average of the polar representations of the cartesian vectors
[21:00:26] <motle> thanks!
[21:00:30] <Cale> I think so
[21:00:43] <motle> in other news, how is everyone doing today?
[21:03:06] <motle> here, its raining so hard that snorkeling equipment is advised for venturing forth upon excursions
[21:08:10] <motle> erp, i hit another snag
[21:08:28] <motle> so, i think i need to transform the cartesian vectors *onto* the circle first...
[21:08:43] <motle> then transform back to cartesians - having normalised the radius
[21:09:05] <motle> otherwise the far away points contribute *more* to the average angle, while they should actually contribute less
[21:09:35] <motle> setting all the radiuses equal to one at least makes them even, but i actually want to boost them if they are close
[21:09:54] <motle> ie the opposite to when the larger radius contributions weighted more heavily in the cartesian average
