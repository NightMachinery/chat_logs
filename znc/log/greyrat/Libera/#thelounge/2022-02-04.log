[00:29:37] <d76d5436757> SSLbits: it's coz they use cloud-init for starting vm images, which does this as a default move
[00:29:44] <bookworm> as long as you get CAP_FOWNER you're good
[00:30:09] <d76d5436757> cloud architecture is fascinating! check out openstack to understand how complex they are
[00:30:10] <bookworm> and sudo for all intents and purposes gives you root as well, sudo -i if you want a root shell
[00:30:15] <SSLbits> yeah sorry. i'm kind of a noob. compared to like digital ocean or making a local vm, it seems unusual to me at least

[09:42:09] <xnaas> hmm...there's a node package for DSM, but idk how ancient it is
[09:42:16] <xnaas> (probably fuckin' ancient)
[09:46:34] <SSLbits> migration seemed to work pretty well. thanks again for the help 
[09:47:18] <SSLbits> i was trying to move to an ARM based instance and tried the npm installation, but i couldn't find the config folder location 
[09:47:32] <SSLbits> and was worried i was going to have issues with nginx
[09:47:37] <bookworm> depends on what you told npm
[09:47:53] <bookworm> and whether you were insane enough to run npm as root
[09:48:11] <bookworm> (it likes to fuck up all kinds of permissions)
[09:48:20] <SSLbits> 🥺 👉 👈
[09:48:37] <SSLbits> i forget what i did on the arm box
[09:49:10] <SSLbits> it looked like it was in my home folder under .thelounge as a hidden folder, but i couldn't find it in winscp with hidden files enabled 
[09:51:23] <bookworm> modifying files on windows for a linux box is bound to end in tears... BOM marker, different EOL conventions, messed up default encoding... you are better of just shelling into the box and do the work there locally
[09:52:05] <SSLbits> yeah i know. and WSL doesn't recognize chown (why i have so many permissions issues)
[09:52:26] <bookworm> it does, just not for all filesystems
[09:52:45] <SSLbits> i couldn't copy files there or in ec2 instance connect or SSM but that could just be me being a noob
[09:54:04] <SSLbits> i should probably have a dedicated linux box in my house for this sort of thing 
[09:55:08] <locke789> bookworm docker is unofficially supported on ds218. I could try using docker way. Hope it doesn’t take too many system resources
[09:56:19] <bookworm> docker on its own doesn't do anything resource wise, only after you start containers and that's about as bad as a plain install
[09:56:35] <bookworm> s/anything/anything noticeable/
[09:57:30] <bookworm> it uses ip more storage but you are on a NAS and that should not be a problem
[09:58:20] <locke789> Will install docker and see how it goes. Anyway to monitor the system resources usage
[09:58:24] <bookworm> keep in mind though that the processors in those aren't really meant to run applications... performance might be bad and maybe a 30$ pie would be better

[20:39:06] <SSLbits> hmm. ever since i migrated, when i join new servers, thelounge doesn't appear to be creating new certs for external sasl
[20:40:18] <SSLbits> making note of the uuid in the user json file, but there's no corresponding crt or pem in the certificates folder
[20:40:21] *** Joins: zer0bitz (~zer0bitz@2001:2003:f74d:b800:39e9:9943:8cd0:5689)
[20:43:56] <bookworm> did you tell it to do that in the auth section?
[20:44:05] <SSLbits> yes
[20:44:10] <bookworm> logs?
[20:44:16] <SSLbits> i suppose i could just manually create one with `openssl req -x509 -new -newkey rsa:4096 -sha256 -days 1096 -nodes -out libera.pem -keyout libera.pem`
[20:45:56] <SSLbits> would you like me to provide logs? i suppose i could. which logs (or where would i find them)?
[20:47:29] <bookworm> well, the question is more if you have anything relevant in the logs... all code paths in question log on error
[20:47:48] <bookworm> and I'm referring to the TL log output, as in stdout of the server process
[20:49:07] <SSLbits> i'm sorry. i may not be technical enough to provide anything meaningful
[20:49:22] <SSLbits> but i'm willing to try
[20:49:26] <bookworm> it works fine on my installation (though that's the bleeding edge fork of mine)
[20:49:34] <bookworm> how did you start TL?
[20:50:06] <bookworm> also, which OS while we are at it?
[20:50:29] <SSLbits> sudo systemctl start thelounge
[20:50:31] <SSLbits> ubuntu
[20:50:32] <SSLbits> 20.04
[20:51:01] <bookworm> `journalctl -u thelounge -r`
[20:51:22] <bookworm> that will show you the log in reverse order (-r) limited to thelounge (-u)
[20:52:05] <bookworm> you might need to add sudo, but do so only if you get a permission error. Not sure what ubuntu does by default in regards to log privileges
[20:54:54] <SSLbits> i'm getting access denied errors
[20:55:00] <SSLbits> i can put it in a pastebin if you'd like 
[20:55:18] <SSLbits> but i think this might be a permissions issue. i know you mentioned chown when migrating 
[20:56:09] <SSLbits> 2022-02-04 17:00:31 [ERROR] Unable to write certificate Error: EACCES: permission denied, open '/etc/thelounge/certificates/>
[21:09:07] <SSLbits> i think if i just found out who owns /etc/theounge/ i can just rescursively chown the folders contents to that owner as well
[21:10:36] <xnaas> should be a user called 'thelounge', no?
[21:10:50] <SSLbits> yep. that and root
[21:11:21] <SSLbits> not sure why that would differ between my instances, but i can chown thelounge. brb
[21:12:27] *** Joins: Soni (~quassel@autistic.space)
[21:13:49] <SSLbits> yep. i think `sudo chown -R thelounge /etc/thelounge` fixed it 
[21:13:57] <SSLbits> thanks yall. i'm such a linux noob
[21:14:21] <SSLbits> but that's why i'm trying to toy around with this stuff in a lab environment 
[21:16:38] <SSLbits> i really appreciate everyone's help
[21:21:51] <bookworm> that's an artifact of the copying from instance A to B
[21:22:08] <xnaas> the only way to test is in prod
[21:22:16] *** Joins: trekkie1701c (~trekkie17@user/trekkie1701c)
[21:22:46] <bookworm> or do I mix up two people now? In any case. Fixed and working (hopefully)
[21:23:07] <bookworm> although we should really fail in this case, rather than silently continue
[21:26:22] <SSLbits> well this is still a great project (perhaps the best irc client out there) and this is a very helpful lab scenario for me to derust and learn
[21:26:43] <SSLbits> next up, i might try migrating from this instance to one on arm
[21:27:13] <xnaas> thelounge is literally the only thing that was able to bring me back to IRC in general
[21:27:17] <xnaas> everything else sucks :P
[21:27:29] <SSLbits> yeah i was running znc for a bit 
[21:27:35] <SSLbits> but the replay is very wonky 
[21:27:49] <SSLbits> also could have just been me being ignorant 
[21:29:20] <SSLbits> hopefully the npm installation on arm doesn't affect nginx and certbot. at first i tried building from source on a t4.nano 👀
[21:29:58] <SSLbits> but then the npm install was throwing a bunch of sqlite3 errors and looked like it had some deprecated dependencies 
[21:35:25] <bookworm> it's you being ignorant, znc works fine ;)
[21:36:08] <bookworm> you'll still get the depreciation notices until my PR with the deps gets merged
[21:36:24] <bookworm> until then you'll need python2 to build sqlite
[21:36:43] <bookworm> just as a heads-up for your arm install
