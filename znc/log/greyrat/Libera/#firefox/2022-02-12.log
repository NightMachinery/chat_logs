[00:55:23] <ede> this is yad https://alternativeto.net/software/yad/about/
[00:56:04] <ede> one of its thing is a file dialog and which a lot of things in firefox may be a mozilla thing i'd think at least that part is original gtk at least mostly.
[00:58:51] <susi> what do you use it for
[01:04:06] <ede> have to see. but sometimes a gui for a task would be nice without the need to install a dozen packages.
[01:05:33] <ede> used its --dnd recently to get a list of URLs out of the browser. no rightclick.copyurl.alttab.insert.alttab dance for each, just drag and you're done.
[01:08:11] <susi> lol. name one task a gui would be nice?
[01:08:30] <susi> maybe photo editing and such visual/graphic creation stuff
[01:08:34] <susi> but can't think of anything else

[01:43:20] <blahboybaz> I had thought there is a simple way to force ff to load an http web page (from the error page it throuws up). I remember being able to access a permission to allow the page to be loaded from that error page. Now I do not see it. I see there is an article about some implementation: https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2020/11/17/firefox-83-introduces-https-only-mode/
[01:44:03] <blahboybaz> what is going on? Are we not being allowed the option of vising pages as WE choose them? Somebody bottom-line this for me please.
[01:49:09] <blahboybaz> btw.. I am perfectly aware of the differences between http and https and what https does.. I just don't appreciate being told what I can and can not visit on the web. For the record, what I was trying to access was a repository mirror page that list the contents of a repository for my o/s. This is a technical issue that come up occasionally (the need to visit a mirror page to see what the problem 
[01:49:15] <blahboybaz> might be). Making it impossible to access that (if that is what is going on) is downright wrong and causes a problem for someone just trying to troubleshoot a problem - as if one problem wasn't enough.

[03:40:56] <blahboybaz> Timvde: I have no idea nor do I know what hsts is. It's not in https only mode (I checked). I don't get any prompt - if I change the url from https to http (or paste directly as http) it will automatically rewrited the url to https and then try to resolve that. Perhaps the cause of the problem is not what I thought (hence the reason for not getting an option to proceed anyway) - but I don't know how 
[03:41:02] <blahboybaz> to tell. 
[03:41:42] <Timvde> blahboybaz: it's a header a website can send to the browser that says "Any time you load any page on this hostname, please only use https and never ever use http"
[03:42:17] <Timvde> It's why Firefox doesn't give an option to add an exception in that case
[03:42:25] <Timvde> The website specifically told it not to do that
[03:44:29] <Timvde> Given what you are seeing, that is my most likely guess
[03:44:41] <blahboybaz> Timvde: I see. I wouldn't know how to verify if that is happening (whether the host is sending that or not) BUT if you assume that it is then it kinda explains something I'm experienceing that I had not mentioned
[03:44:53] <blahboybaz> I think they broke their site over there
[03:45:32] <blahboybaz> implemementing hsts when they may or may not have intended to or not fixed all the things it was going to effect before making it live
[03:46:20] <Timvde> blahboybaz: to verify, go in your Firefox profile and check SiteSecurityServiceState.txt
[03:46:30] <Timvde> If the domain is in there, it's HSTS
[03:46:43] <blahboybaz> Ok thx
[03:46:44] <Timvde> (note: do not save that file outside of Firefox, open it read-only if you can)
[03:47:11] <blahboybaz> so $ less SiteSecurityServiceState.txt
[03:47:12] <blahboybaz> ?
[03:47:17] <Timvde> That would be perfect :)
[03:47:18] <blahboybaz> or cat
[03:47:20] <blahboybaz> ok
[03:48:15] <Timvde> Note: a common mistake is to have "includeSubdomains" in the header
[03:48:46] <Timvde> So they want to set hsts on example.com, but add the "includeSubdomains", and suddenly there's HSTS on sub.example.com

[03:59:55] <Timvde> Hmm, then I don't know what it could be.
[03:59:59] <blahboybaz> That's pretty scary though - there's a list of a lot of the sites I have visited
[04:00:15] <blahboybaz> Timvde: I'll worry about it later I guess
[04:00:21] <blahboybaz> Thanks for showing me about it
[04:01:31] <Timvde> blahboybaz: your history has an even bigger list of sites that you have visited :)
[04:02:41] <Timvde> blahboybaz: I believe that the HSTS list is also cleared if you set Firefox to delete cookies on shutdown
[04:02:56] <blahboybaz> Thats some freaky stuff
[04:03:04] <blahboybaz> that's cool to know
[04:07:13] <Timvde> blahboybaz: why is it freaky?
[04:07:25] <Timvde> It's on your computer, not somewhere on the internet
[04:08:47] <blahboybaz> Timvde: Hackers do exist (and maliciaous sites)
[04:09:06] <Timvde> So do you have history disabled?
[04:09:17] <Timvde> And websites can't access the list
[04:09:33] <blahboybaz> Timvde: I have no idea
[04:09:57] <blahboybaz> It's one of those things I never took the time to get into
[04:11:02] <blahboybaz> I mean it's not like I'm all puckered up about it..  Although I have encountered some scary web sites in the past (stuff that starts showing you the places you visited)

[19:55:04] <t4nk_freenode> in my kde plasma.. there've been long standing bugs about the little thumbnail previews of the windows
[19:55:58] <t4nk_freenode> if you had multiple windows open, and played a video or something somewhere, then the thumbnails and titles and such would all be the same for all 
[19:56:46] <t4nk_freenode> that's been fixed, sort of, but I still see some darned media controls underneath every darned thumbnail
[19:57:05] <t4nk_freenode> and the title of the media on the bottom
[19:57:42] <t4nk_freenode> one and the same, even if you had 3 videos playing
[19:57:53] <t4nk_freenode> it's driving me nuts ;)
[19:58:12] <t4nk_freenode> if I want it to go away.. I have to look up the tab that has it, and refresh the page
[19:58:41] <t4nk_freenode> is anyone experiencing the same? and how do you feel about it?

[23:07:31] <akik> where did the setting move in firefox settings where i could set the amount of firefox processes?
[23:07:51] <akik> now it looks like it starts one process per tab
[23:09:15] *** Joins: Cyp_ (~cyp@213.237.87.172)
[23:09:27] <t4nk_freenode> I currently have 12 firefox processes, maybe that's the max

[23:10:05] <t4nk_freenode> then there's GeckoMain
[23:10:48] <akik> i have one process per tab. it's easy to see how it increases

[23:12:33] <t4nk_freenode> I have 7 windows at the moment... with hunddddddreds of tabs
[23:12:58] <akik> i close the tabs quite quickly after i'm done with it
[23:13:02] <t4nk_freenode> not all of em opened right now of course
[23:13:13] <t4nk_freenode> but a great many more than processes
[23:13:21] <akik> yes it increases the amount when you open the tab
[23:13:41] <t4nk_freenode> perhaps until the set limit
[23:13:49] <akik> i have 19 now
[23:14:00] <t4nk_freenode> so 19 processes??
[23:14:24] <akik> yes
[23:15:34] <t4nk_freenode> well, that's strange, like I said I currently have 12, and that's 1 more than I normally see
[23:15:56] <t4nk_freenode> I remember limiting the amount once, with the var you mentioned, but that's a long time ago
[23:16:22] <akik> it was a setting in settings, next to the performance settings

[23:16:41] <t4nk_freenode> and I think after that... it got deleted, like a lot of firefox settings you set get deleted or unset with an update (grmbl)

[23:18:22] <t4nk_freenode> I sure never agreed to 12
[23:18:42] <akik> welp i guess it's gone now. maybe i'll find an issue in the tracker
[23:20:11] <akik> it was called content process limit

[23:23:27] <akik> https://www.reddit.com/r/firefox/comments/r69j52/firefox_content_process_limit_is_gone/
[23:23:36] <akik> it's gone james, gone
[23:23:57] <akik> "If you must have websites share the same process (dangerous), you can change fission.webContentIsolationStrategy to 2 (isolate high value) or 0 (isolate nothing)."
[23:25:20] <akik> that works, setting it to 0
[23:25:25] <akik> now i only get 7 processes
