[10:05:52] <xe0n> how long is a piece of string?
[10:06:01] <xe0n> have you looked at event logs, and what do you mean "offline"
[10:06:14] <xe0n> you're aware of what the latest patches have changed with the print spooler
[10:14:43] <gibby> something something printnightmare 
[10:17:30] <sd> 11<도​현> I mean by offline that in print management it shows that the printer status is offline
[10:17:46] <sd> 11<도​현> And therefore users cannot print from that printer

[12:49:38] <Oliber> yeah true
[12:49:59] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> only reason we do macs with DEP into our jamf that way is because apple uses the same image with no extra software at all for every machine
[12:50:44] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> Only way i could do autopilot is if we went into an image agreement with dell and had them pre-image machines with our shit before shipping and that'd make them more expensive than the macs, not just about the same price

[13:11:05] <sd> 02<S​ir Sceptalot> Dear elders of the internet, I come to you seeking guidance.
[13:11:05] <sd> 02<S​ir Sceptalot> I'll be replacing a few switches soon, and I'm wondering if it'll be worth it to start going for 10Gb equipment and 2.5Gb or 10Gb NIC's for regular users.
[13:11:05] <sd> 02<S​ir Sceptalot> Will this make any difference at all, considering pretty much nobody really handles extremely large files?
[13:11:05] <sd> 02<S​ir Sceptalot> 
[13:11:05] <sd> 02<S​ir Sceptalot> We have CAD (Solidworks), CAM, and obviously a plethora of other software.
[13:11:05] <sd> 02<S​ir Sceptalot> 
[13:11:29] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> so the question is really
[13:11:37] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> are they doing big ass file transfers back and forth to the workstation
[13:11:42] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> or working on the files over network?
[13:13:20] <sd> 02<S​ir Sceptalot> I'm... not sure...
[13:13:20] <sd> 02<S​ir Sceptalot> They don't copy the CAD files over manually to work on them, but I'm not sure if the software saves directly over the network or if it's cache/sync stuff
[13:13:36] <sd> 02<S​ir Sceptalot> but since you said "big ass file", then no.
[13:14:20] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> I mean, if you have the option - i'd get switches that have 10g access ports, with 40g uplinks
[13:14:29] <sd> 02<S​ir Sceptalot> I would figure it not to make a huge difference since they're not big files, but I've never worked on/with 10Gb so I figured I'd ask
[13:14:31] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> so don't factor the workstations in at alll - right now -
[13:14:49] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> but future proof yourself out the ass
[13:15:01] <sd> 02<S​ir Sceptalot> jeez louise
[13:15:12] <sd> 02<S​ir Sceptalot> right now we're still on all 1Gb
[13:15:27] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> i mean, you can run 40g ports at 10g or whatever, no big deal
[13:15:40] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> but dell uses 40g for inter-switch stacking for example
[13:15:46] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> using HDMI cables even, lol

[13:17:00] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> @Sir Sceptalot if you have RJ-45 access ports to clients, i'd take a good look at dell's offerings
[13:17:31] <sd> 02<S​ir Sceptalot> eh... MSP does switches, and they do cisco
[13:17:34] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> prices aren't absurd, and they have RJ-45 10gig switches

[13:17:52] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> ah
[13:17:59] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> so you'll have 10g access ports either way, i guess?

[13:18:48] <sd> 02<S​ir Sceptalot> If I ask for 10Gb access port switches, I'll have them. Right now they offered 1Gb
[13:19:06] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> i'd do that for access ports, but ask what the uplink capability is

[13:20:14] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> so if you got some old ass gear like an hp laserjet 4 (my home printer....) you can stick a gigabit unmanaged switch in between
[13:20:17] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> to make it work
[13:20:33] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> 10g ports normally can only go down to 100mbit
[13:20:52] <sd> 02<S​ir Sceptalot> that should be good, I don't think we have any 10mbit stuff
[13:21:08] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> you never know, but like i said - sticking a gig switch in between makes it work
[13:21:28] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> so yea - get 10gig across the board minmum, even if it's just 10gig uplinks
[13:21:43] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> while it doesn't matter, faster link speed reduces latency a bit....
[13:21:47] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> but think of it as future proofing
[13:21:59] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> but do ask if the switches they provide do multi-gig or just 10gig
[13:22:10] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> if it's multi-gig then you can set up 2.5 on the workstations
[13:22:19] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> if it's just 10gig, you're limited to 1gbit or 10gbit
[13:22:39] <sd> 02<S​ir Sceptalot> considering how long cisco switches last, future proofing is prolly not a bad idea. We still have a few 100Mb switches somewhere

[18:57:35] <oxipital> congrats, how'd you manage that, int0x1C8
[18:57:36] <int0x1C8> just took almost 5 weeks of complaining
[18:58:31] <int0x1C8> pregabalin and tylenol weren't doing shit and I was still needing to leave an hour or 2 early everyday to WFH the rest of the afternoon because it got to the point where I couldn't concentrate on anything else

[18:58:49] <oxipital> i know how that is

[18:59:01] <int0x1C8> so 2.5mg hydrocodone
[18:59:30] <oxipital> whats interesting is when doctors get sick they crumple like paper bags
[18:59:32] <int0x1C8> which is I think the lowest dose they make, but enough for me
[18:59:44] <oxipital> it is
[19:00:55] <int0x1C8> to think my doctor told me a week ago "tylenol is going to do as good if not better than an opiate for your nerve pain"

[19:03:23] <PublicWiFi> then at the end it says "We recommend against exposing the ActiveSync endpoint to external access."
[19:03:34] <PublicWiFi> whats the point in having activesync enabled if you won't have it pointing out  lol
[19:03:54] <PublicWiFi> activesync + phone whitelist is pretty much okay in my book
[19:04:11] <CptLuxx> phone whitelist?

[19:05:06] <CptLuxx> like whitelistening specific devices?

[23:53:06] <sd> 13<b​ug> but not to rely on obviously
[23:53:11] <oxipital> this is amazing. this is the response i got about an interviewer dicking me around: https://uploads.kiwiirc.com/files/4d305cd1724a1fe7843678dabaf8102b/pasted.txt
[23:53:21] <sd> 13<b​ug> thanks dude

[23:53:36] <oxipital> bug: that makes perfect sense
[23:53:45] <oxipital> and good mentors are rare
[23:53:48] <sd> 06<C​omputer man, fix my pants!> this industry is so bottom heavy right now that good luck finding someone with the time and inclination to show you the ropes
[23:53:54] <oxipital> you either get morons or well akshually

[23:54:35] <oxipital> when what you need is someojhe who can make it fun again
[23:54:44] <thegodsquirrel> I agree with computer man, slowly lean in and go for a kiss, it will solve all your problems.
[23:54:48] <sd> 13<b​ug> I mean, I stand by with what I said about being confident in myself. I'd say(honestly) I feel well versed for the position I'm in
[23:56:01] <thegodsquirrel> I think it is time for you to start a blog.
[23:56:09] <sd> 13<b​ug> buddy, I have considred it
[23:56:12] <sd> 13<b​ug> considred*
[23:56:13] <sd> 13<b​ug> fml
[23:56:17] <sd> 13<b​ug> considered*
[23:56:19] <thegodsquirrel> But in all seriousness, sound like your manager is a dingus
[23:56:22] <int0x1C8> ending up in your wait and consuming your precious tim
[23:56:25] <int0x1C8> OH GOD NOT TIM
[23:56:38] <sd> 13<b​ug> he's actually a solid guy, but I just don't think he's suited for his position
[23:56:41] <sd> 06<C​omputer man, fix my pants!> It'
[23:56:53] <sd> 06<C​omputer man, fix my pants!> It's like 90% crap managers out there
[23:56:59] <thegodsquirrel> Best managers I ever had let me test, test, and prove something would work and if it brought value to the company they would look into doing it
[23:57:09] <oxipital> i have no idea how to become a manager though
[23:57:12] <oxipital> i so want to do it
[23:57:17] <oxipital> because they do so little
[23:57:19] <sd> 13<b​ug> this
[23:57:28] <sd> 06<C​omputer man, fix my pants!> you learn to be a smooth talker with no substance
[23:57:34] <sd> 06<C​omputer man, fix my pants!> basically, take acting classes
[23:57:34] <oxipital> i already am
[23:57:40] <sd> 13<b​ug> I owe everything I know about ZyWall firewalls to my previous baws
[23:57:46] <sd> 06<C​omputer man, fix my pants!> yet you are on IRC, curious
[23:57:50] <oxipital> im incapable of landing a job wherew i have to do something beyond schlep hardware
[23:58:00] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> ZyWall
[23:58:01] <thegodsquirrel> Most managers get that role by being promoted away
[23:58:05] <oxipital> like actually lack the capabilities
[23:58:09] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> sounds like something that once you get a real job you'll never touch again
[23:58:10] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> 😄
[23:58:15] <int0x1C8> oxipital, that's an email from an interviewer at a position?
[23:58:19] <oxipital> so they start out being cook
[23:58:31] <oxipital> int0x1C8: a manager at his recruiting agency
[23:58:49] *** Parts: majavah (taavi@wikimedia/majavah) (K-Lined)
[23:58:53] <oxipital> i fired off him and the cio of his client an email for being fucked around with by one of his interviewers
[23:58:55] <int0x1C8> oh even worse
[23:59:50] <oxipital> for some reason a local hospital has hired indian consultants to come on site and manage IT projects
[23:59:57] <sd> 13<b​ug> just out of curiosity, how dry is the market at the moment? I.e, if I were to start looking for another job
[23:59:58] <oxipital> they hire locals to staff it
