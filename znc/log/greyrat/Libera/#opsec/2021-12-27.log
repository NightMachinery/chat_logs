[05:10:31] <jan6> 02:49 <Joanna> I wonder if there is a script for registered accounts
[05:10:33] <jan6> wdym?
[05:39:16] <Joanna> jan6: what is wdym?
[05:39:31] <jan6> very common acronym, "what do you mean"
[05:39:47] <jan6> like how "iirc" is "if I remember correctly"
[05:40:06] <jan6> and "afaik" is "as far as I know"
[05:40:28] <jan6> all three are veeeery common shorthands
[05:40:31] <Joanna> Oh just speculating because trolls keep coming to my other channel and I wonder if they manually create accounts
[05:41:21] <jan6> well, it's pretty easy to create accounts, lol
[05:42:35] <jan6> all you'd need to do is have a way to automatically swap out proxies, because pretty sure your IPs would be abuse-banned if you constantly churned new accounts, and a super basic bot, and quite a few email accounts
[05:44:13] <Joanna> I guess but why would someone take the effort to manually register an account so that they can troll in a pascal channel with around 10 inactive members?
[05:45:18] <jan6> the much more logical explanation is either 1) simply different people, possibly friends, or 2) just using compromised accounts
[05:45:41] <jan6> and there's always 3) that it's not exactly trolling in the first place
[05:45:54] <jan6> because your definition of "trolling" is way stricter than a lot of other people's
[05:46:09] <Joanna> I know a troll when I see one :)
[05:46:36] <jan6> I bet just adding a smiley at the end of every message would make you detect one ;P
[05:46:43] <jan6> jk ;)
[05:50:10] <Joanna> It would certainly start to annoy me they better be saying something really interesting before each smiley!
[05:51:40] <Joanna> What would you think if you owned the Linux channel and someone came there and said. Do you actually use Linux??
[05:57:16] <jan6> that they can't read
[05:57:31] <jan6> or that they're unaware of -offtopic channels
[05:57:40] <jan6> mostly latter
[06:01:47] <jan6> it's a bit antagonistic, sure, but not necessarily intended badly, it could, for example, be someone who doesn't think linux is actually usable for anything other than maybe servers, since hey, you can't even run ms office, or adobe programs, or most AAA games, or anything, how could anyone actually USE it?
[06:03:01] <jan6> not everyone knows of alternatives, or how good/bad those alternatives are, too
[06:04:52] <jan6> like adobe suite might be "industry standard", so they want to run that, without even considering that you could use for example krita or gimp + kdenlive or davinci resolve, for most of the same stuff, and the alternative office suites are often also pretty capable, some handle ms's formats better than others
[06:05:14] <jan6> etc
[06:06:20] <jan6> not as many fancy games, sure, but about enough to be liveable, and dualbooting is also a thing a lot of people might not know about
[06:06:21] <jan6> etc etc
[06:07:01] <jan6> there's a lot of people with a lot of different perspectives, experiences, and knowledge, about any given topic
[06:07:29] <jan6> barging in like that would be totally a thing someone who barely knows anything about linux would do
[06:08:39] <jan6> the other side would be "linux community is so elitist! I just asked if anyone actually uses it, and I got banned!" going to whine about it on all other platforms
[06:11:14] <jan6> so y'know, plenty of different possibilities, with big and/or popular and/or "only" channels (like, a non-popular language/program/framework's channel) you can never tell who's just new and/or lacks knowledge, or who's straight away trolling for lulz
[06:13:04] <jan6> and most channels also tolerate off-topic chatter anyway, just giving priority to anything on-topic, so it's fine if you derail to the topic of "is linux even usable as daily driver, if I need X", as long as you're not doing so WHILE someone else is asking for help
[06:17:19] <jan6> *derail to
[06:17:28] <jan6> *topic to
[06:17:30] <jan6> whatever, lol
[06:17:32] * jan6 sleeps
[06:17:43] <jan6> it's 04:47 here, lol
[06:19:05] <jan6> but still, ^ keeping an open mind is best
[06:20:40] <jan6> #bash's greycat has also really surprised me, with how he manages to calmly explain for the 3000th time some simple thing that might or might not have been asked seriously, and other such stuff (or well, did at the time I actively looked at all the chat there)

[14:07:23] <Joanna> jan6: I have a simple policy for a channel for a particular programming language and that is I reserve the right to ban anyone who isn’t using it because they really have no reason to be there if they aren’t using the tech whatever it is. So everytime someone who acts strange comes along I have a streamlined decision making process on deciding whether to ban them. Some people think that the  channel is a place for informing people 
[14:07:23] <Joanna> or convincing people who hate the language to change their minds. I don’t mind trying to help people who are starting out but people whom I don’t know who talk offtopic or troll get banned.
[14:10:25] <Joanna> I’ve gotten a lot of flack for being strict but I represent the interests of the project and I know how easy it is for one troll to kill an irc channel.
[14:11:00] <Joanna> Especially a small channel.
