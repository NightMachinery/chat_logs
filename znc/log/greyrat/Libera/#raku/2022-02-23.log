[00:36:21] <Guest1838> sorry, this got long:  it suddenly popped into mind, "-Ofun", optimized for FUN! :)   as an operational newbie (albeit longtime 10,000-foot lurker) to raku, could someone point me to something that i could do for the community that would be 1) low barrier to entry, 2) useful, 3) would help me (gradually) ease myself into the
[00:36:21] <Guest1838> language/ecosystem/community, while also be useful for everyone?  assuming i don't flake (like i'm sure many with a rush of enthusiasm ultimately do), my personal interest in raku is more in the "100-year language" sense, less in the "i have a TODO that i need to DO today" sense...  i would love if humanity had a "lingua franca" in the
[00:36:22] <Guest1838> computational realm, and the various contenders i am aware of for "total systems" are just... not inspiring to me, personally, for this or that reason... raku has great technology, but i think more importantly it has a wonderful community... polite, open, and *unrushed*... "rome wasn't built in a day" and all that
[00:37:24] <tonyo> a pure raku gzip module would be nice
[00:38:28] <[Coke]> there's bug queues for rakudo/nqp/moarVM/docs which usually have some tag to indicate good tickets or first users... what sort of skills? programming? (what langs), QA, documentation...
[00:39:24] <japhb> Guest1838: You could ask lizmat if she would like help with her ecosystem update work, she's got like 100 modules left to convert (but may have gotten into an efficient groove already, I dunno)
[00:46:52] <Guest1838> i love the idea of a gzip module (compression is interesting theoretically and practically, and having something that was streaming, concurrent, etc. would be neat), but that's beyond my ken ATM
[00:46:53] <Guest1838> in term of bug trackers, where are those?  is https://rakudo.org/issue-trackers the canonical starting point?
[00:47:30] <Guest1838> as for module conversion, that's probably not yet appropriate for me either, given that i really am not up to speed on the language proper
[00:47:36] <[Coke]> it's a great place to start, sure!
[00:48:59] <Guest1838> sweet!
[00:50:31] <MasterDuke> well, i don't think the module conversion really requires any raku programming. i think it's mostly some git and shell commands and editing a json file
[00:51:36] <Guest1838> ahhh, okay, i didn't know that... is there a page that talks about what it is/entails in more detail?
[00:54:05] <MasterDuke> i don't think so, you'd need to chat with lizmat

[02:33:13] <guifa> Guest1838 to be honest, if you take a simple module from another language and try to convert it, you'll learn a lot
[02:33:35] <guifa> You'll probably end up rewriting it all from scratch when you're done based on everything you learn, but having something practical as a goal is really useful
[02:34:10] <guifa> What language are you coming from?
[02:36:10] <lizmat> Guest1838: what also could be helpful is collecting and / or remastering blog posts in the CCR https://github.com/raku/CCR

[20:13:43] <cognominal> I don't understand the package is there on GitHub https://github.com/pierre-vigier/Perl6-Data-MessagePack
[20:13:50] <moritz> cognominal: does 'git clone git@github.com:pierre-vigier/Perl6-Data-MessagePack.git' work for you?
[20:15:30] <cognominal> morizt: It says I don't have the access rights :(
[20:16:08] <cognominal> I must do something from zef to enable them ?
[20:16:43] <moritz> I tend to have an SSH key where the public key is known to github
[20:17:44] <cognominal> Thx. Ok. Will do that. But why not providing access thru https ?
[20:19:57] <moritz> dunno; isn't it the module author's choice which URL they put in?
[20:20:48] <cognominal> Ok, I will ping the author.
[20:22:19] <cognominal> The package is 4 years old and is used for MoarVM debugging. I would be surprised to be the only one one bit by that
[20:24:04] <cognominal> $ ls -al ~/.ssh
