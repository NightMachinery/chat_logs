[19:18:25] <lz_> interop_madness: also I didn't know what "efilist" meant, I learned a new word. I don't think life is inherently bad, I just think that any amount of suffering disqualifies everything else life can bring

[19:26:00] <interop_madness> yeah that's basically the efilist ideology
[19:26:16] <lz_> anyway I think advanced civilizations opt out completely and it could be the explanation of the fermi paradox
[19:26:24] <interop_madness> the only real emotion is suffering, what people call "bliss" or feeling good is the momentary lack or attenuation of suffering
[19:26:31] <Shariff> imho everyone is free to make the decision to opt out of kids, but that too will lead to great problems...
[19:26:51] <lz_> interop_madness: I don't think it's the only real emotion at all. I'm just saying some people are in hell and they don't deserve it
[19:27:00] <Shariff> interop_madness: no-true-scottsman falicy ? :)
[19:27:11] <interop_madness> hence, life is suffering, only suffering, and, since giving birth is imposing life, giving birth is imposing suffering, therefore people who conceive are criminals

[19:27:36] <lz_> it's not only suffering. it's suffering for maybe 10 to 30% ppl, and that's plenty enough a reason not to make people

[19:28:55] <interop_madness> I would even go as far as saying the average suffering per person is higher in developed countries with high depression rates than in 3rd world countries with low depression rates

[19:50:06] <khanred> and I guess we're just never going back
[19:50:10] <brianonymous> not too long ago youd have no time to worry about it, cuz youd be too busy milking chickens
[19:50:28] <Shariff> O_o
[19:50:39] <khanred> I thought you had to choke chickens to get their milk?
[19:50:47] <brianonymous> you may be right
[19:51:09] <khanred> I milk my chicken more than I care to admit
[19:51:55] <Lukky> Working remotely from home allows me to take as long a dump as I need to :-)
[19:51:55] <nicode> What did I walk into...
[19:52:22] <tlf> us choking chickens
[19:52:24] <tlf> duh
[19:52:51] <lz_> we're self conscious poop machines

[19:53:50] <nicode> You are a compost bin and everything you eat is compostable.
[19:54:05] <brianonymous> walking, talking poop tubes
[19:54:12] <Lukky> they should pay us for that
[19:54:45] <nicode> You do get paid, in food distractions and transportation.
[19:55:00] <Lukky> meh
[19:55:05] <nicode> missed a comma, but maybe that was a freudian slip.
[19:55:20] <brianonymous> i was curious what a food distraction was
[19:55:23] * khanred wrecks
[19:55:27] <Lukky> :-)
[19:55:40] <nicode> food distracts you from your real job, pooping.
[19:55:47] <Lukky> eating beaver is what I call food distraction...
[19:55:53] <khanred> But there is no pooping without food
[19:55:56] <brianonymous> i thought it was more like finding out there were donuts in the breakroom
[19:56:09] <khanred> There's poop in the breakroom
[19:56:15] <nicode> Future poop.
[19:58:12] <lz_> at a NASA meeting: "hey guys, we really need to poop on other planets, how about mars"
[19:58:58] <lz_> here's us pooping on the moon https://timesknowledge.wwmindia.com/content/2019/apr/trash11554879978.jpg
[19:59:09] <khanred> The moon pooping was faked
[19:59:34] <brianonymous> we first had to master pooping in the depths of space itself. i wonder if anyone actually pooped on the moon as well. cuz you could be the first human to poop on another terrestrial body. thats some amazing creds. i would have attempted it.

[20:33:30] <jonp> JakeSays: i know.  it was a joke.
[20:33:38] <jonp> Lukky: added language complexity
[20:33:46] <JakeSays> Lukky: there's no benefit to them.
[20:33:50] <JakeSays> and yeah that
[20:33:51] <jonp> it also "hard-codes" a specific XML lib into the language
[20:33:57] <JakeSays> ^
[20:34:21] <Lukky> hmmm... what would be an equivalent?
[20:34:23] <jonp> i prefer "more general" language features, like object & collection initializers.

[21:24:17] <DevJohnC> unpopular opinion: I find TypeScript kinda fugly and super hard to parse
[21:25:07] <bomb> that opinion is quite popular among my friends
[21:25:14] <alguien> DevJohnC, can you give an example?
[21:25:22] <alguien> because, you know, you're in C#
[21:25:56] <DevJohnC> export const SocialEditor: FC<SocialEditorProps> = ({ placeholder, ...props }) => {
[21:26:13] <DevJohnC> wat
[21:26:47] <alguien> RHS looks fine to me
[21:27:32] <alguien> the only weird thing is the type anotation
[21:27:53] <alguien> to me
[21:28:23] <alguien> sorry, that's too many chat lines...
[21:28:26] <DevJohnC> to my eyes it takes a not-insignificant mental effort to parse and grok that line, and it's just a single line of many, making it hard for me to read and grok TypeScript
[21:28:53] <Nasp> That's why i'm not always a fan of shorter less readable code
[21:29:04] <Nasp> Like when someone insists on doing something in a single 50 lines Linq
[21:29:40] <alguien> what would that be in C#, public readonly FC<SocialEditorProps> SocialEditor = (/*not sure that C# can do this*/) => {
