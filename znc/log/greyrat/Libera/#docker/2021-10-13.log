[01:50:49] <kittonian> big difference
[01:51:04] <kittonian> instead of mapping from your host filesystem to a docker container, you are doing the opposite
[01:51:46] <kittonian> and apparently when you run a docker-compose file it automatically creates a name_static-files volume so that you can share it with other docker-compose containers and map the directory
[01:51:52] <kittonian> but i cannot figure out how to make it happen

[02:02:53] <imp> maybe I'm too dumb but I can't see the difference.
[02:06:49] <zoredache> kittonian: that isn't what a named volume is.
[02:07:02] <kittonian> zoredache, you are correct. wrong term
[02:07:06] <kittonian> external volume
[02:07:26] <kittonian> but i still can't find a solution to getting it working
[02:07:55] <zoredache> Maybe step back and tell us why you need this. Since I don't believe what you want is possible, but there may be alternatives.
[02:08:06] <kittonian> imp, you don't understand the difference between sharing a local directory on your host TO a docker container, vs sharing a directory ON the docker container TO your local host?
[02:08:27] <kittonian> i have two docker-compose files
[02:08:34] <kittonian> one for apache and another for nextcloud
[02:08:57] <kittonian> I need to give apache access to the files in the nextcloud container so it can server all the static content
[02:09:29] <kittonian> nextcloud container = nextcloud
[02:09:38] <kittonian> path on nextcloud = /var/www/html
[02:09:44] <kittonian> apache container = apache
[02:09:55] <zoredache> so you want something shared between multiple containers, not between a container and the host
[02:10:00] <kittonian> I need to map /var/www/html (from nextcloud) to /usr/local/apache2/htdocs
[02:10:04] <zoredache> sharing between containers is easy with a volume.
[02:10:05] <kittonian> correct
[02:10:08] <kittonian> that's the entire issue
[02:10:28] <kittonian> great, but i haven't found a solution using two docker-compose files
[02:11:05] <kittonian> so how do I make this happen?
[02:12:09] <zoredache> make a volume named shared or something at the command line
[02:12:20] <zoredache> and reference it as an external volume in your two compose files
[02:12:22] <kittonian> i need this be persistent upon reboot
[02:12:46] <kittonian> can i create a volume from within a docker-compose file?
[02:13:36] <zoredache> Do you have all your containers in a single compose file, or do you have multiple files?
[02:13:43] <kittonian> multiple
[02:14:01] <kittonian> and the files I need apache to access are IN the nextcloud container, not local on the host
[02:14:58] *** Quits: tex (~super@user/dix) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[02:15:22] <zoredache> Having it as multiple compose files makes it more complicated. I mostly don't use compose, and use ansible to do everything so I am not sure of the syntax you would need.
[02:15:36] <kittonian> you just said it was easy
[02:15:45] <kittonian> lol
[02:15:56] <zoredache> I said it was easy to share a volume between containers, yes
[02:16:17] <zoredache> and it is, make the volume seperately, and then reference it as an external volume.
[02:16:38] <kittonian> when you say a "volume" does this mean another name for a path to a directory inside a container?
[02:16:49] <kittonian> my_volume=nextcloud_container/var/www/html
[02:17:22] <zoredache> a volume is a (https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/)
[02:17:37] <kittonian> i am well aware of volumes
[02:17:45] <kittonian> i'm specifically asking to ensure you understand the issue
[02:18:16] <zoredache> I do
[02:18:18] <kittonian> because everything i'm reading is talking about mapping to local files on the host, not creating a sudo hard disk with a name
[02:18:33] <kittonian> i cannot overwrite these nextcloud file
[02:18:38] <kittonian> *files)
[02:18:51] <kittonian> i just need them to be able to be accessible from another container
[02:19:03] <zoredache> So do you already HAVE a volume?
[02:19:12] <zoredache> maybe take a couple minutes and post  your compose files
[02:19:20] <zoredache> in gist/pastebin/etc
[02:19:33] <kittonian> and if, when starting a docker-compose container it automatically creates a name_static-files volume, it would seem that you could reference that as an external volume by simply doing name_static-files/var/www/html
[02:19:59] <kittonian> I have not created my own volume, only mapped local files to container files
[02:21:28] <kittonian> this is my nextcloud docker-compose file
[02:21:28] <kittonian> https://pastebin.com/TcnWwm4y
[02:22:29] <zoredache> You are not using volumes at all there, only bind mounts
[02:23:15] <kittonian> this is my apache docker-compose
[02:23:15] <kittonian> https://pastebin.com/wY76Cbgh
[02:23:35] <kittonian> well, technically I think it's called volume mapping, but yes, that's what I was saying

[02:27:36] *** Quits: aidalgol (~aidalgol@user/aidalgol) (Ping timeout: 245 seconds)
[02:28:28] <zoredache> if you wanted the nextcloud/data directory to be under htdocs/nextcloud_data you would add a line like this under your volumes section of the http container `- /web/nextcloud/data:/usr/local/apache2/htdocs/nextcloud_data`
[02:32:02] *** Joins: aidalgol (~aidalgol@user/aidalgol)
[02:32:02] <kittonian> no, that would map a /web/nextcloud/data directory on the local filesystem
[02:32:12] <kittonian> not from within the nextcloud container
[02:33:04] <zoredache> yes, and the nextcould container is also pointing at the exactly same place
[02:34:00] <zoredache> If your data is stored under `/web/nextcloud/data` on the host, then you just add a bind mount to that path into the place you need it.
[02:35:11] <kittonian> it is not
[02:35:23] <kittonian> i need to map from within the nextcloud container
[02:35:25] <kittonian> nothing more
[02:35:36] <zoredache> why do you think you need that?
[02:35:51] <kittonian> i can't keep explaining the same thing over and over
[02:36:12] <kittonian> i asked a straight forward question
[02:36:27] <kittonian> how do I mount an external volume from a different docker-compose file
[02:36:28] <zoredache> yes, and I gave you an answer, but you aren't underwstanding it
[02:36:30] <kittonian> that's all i need to know
[02:36:38] <kittonian> no, you aren't understanding the use case
[02:36:51] <kittonian> apache needs access to this directory in order to serve the static files
[02:37:02] <kittonian> and that directory exists from within the nextcloud container
[02:37:06] <zoredache> Just try adding the line I suggested and see what happens
[02:37:07] <kittonian> not on the local filesystem
[02:37:23] <zoredache> I am 99.9% sure it won't  hurt anything
[02:37:29] <kittonian> i don't need to see what happens. i already have lines like that all over the place. that is for mapping a local directory to a container
[02:37:33] <kittonian> that is not what I need
[02:37:59] <kittonian> your line says on the local filesystem there is a directory called /web/nextcloud/data that contains files
[02:38:28] <kittonian> tell the nextcloud container that it should use that directory instead of it's own directory so that if the container is destroyed, the files within data will remain on the local filesystem
[02:38:33] <kittonian> that's what your command does
[02:39:06] <zoredache> the line I suggested adding was to the APACHE contianer
[02:39:16] <zoredache> it wouldn't do anything to the nextcloud container

[04:42:20] <zoredache> unless you also install k8s, it doesn't have any containers running by default.
[04:42:35] <raijin> I see them with I -l --all
[04:43:25] <zoredache> From the windows side of things you just start a container with 'docker run --options image command
[04:43:32] <zoredache> or start them with compose
[04:43:50] <raijin> so the container in question is running on a linode
[04:44:19] <zoredache> You mean you already have containers running on linnode that you want to connect to?
[04:44:22] <raijin> why is vscode trying to connect to a mystery URL, is the real question here
[04:44:31] <raijin> zoredache: yes
[04:44:56] <zoredache> Do you have ssh access to the linode box running docker?
[04:45:06] <raijin> yup
[04:45:25] <raijin> I'm actually chatting ssh'ed into weechat on the linode in question
[04:47:51] <zoredache> I would be tempted to setup a context
[04:47:55] <zoredache> and use the context
[04:47:58] <zoredache> `docker context create linnode --docker ssh://dockeruser@yourhost.linode.com`
[04:48:07] <zoredache> replace with your user/host
[04:48:39] <zoredache> then do `docker context use linode`

[04:49:31] <zoredache> That works best if you have key-based auth setup, an agent running ,and you need the OpenSSH client installed under windows
[04:51:29] <raijin> hmm I don't know that i have the agent running
[04:52:25] <raijin> looks like it is there but not running, let me check on windows dogma for this

[05:02:44] <zoredache> after creating the context and so on does 'docker system info' show you the details for your linode host?
[05:02:55] <raijin> same error -_- 
[05:03:14] <raijin> I wwas looking at  the default context
[05:03:31] <raijin> let me follow your instructions, I had a step to cath up

[15:40:04] <kittonian> good morning all
[15:40:53] <wez> Good evening kittonian!!!
[15:40:57] <wez> How are you?
[15:41:49] <kittonian> I created my own Dockerfile because I didn't want to have to keep installing sudo, nano, etc. every time I stopped and restarted the docker container. However, even though I am installing memcached during build, it is not automatically starting when I bring up the container via docker-compose up -d. I have to grab a bash prompt and manually /etc/init.d/memcached start and then all is well. How can I fix this?
[15:41:59] <kittonian> hi wez. I'm good. how are you?
[15:42:32] <wez> It doesn't work if you set it as a command?
[15:43:09] <kittonian> that's the really strange thing. if I use CMD service memcached start && /bin/bash, the container crashes
[15:43:27] <kittonian> I've tried ENTRYPOINT service memcached start && /bin/bash, and it crashes
[15:43:47] <wez> You could try CMD service memcached start &; /bin/bash
[15:43:52] <kittonian> if I remove starting memcached, it comes up just fine but then I have to start it manually from bash
[15:44:00] <wez> Or setup an entrypoint script
[15:44:15] <kittonian> happy to try whatever, and really appreciate your assistance
[15:44:49] *** Joins: INeedAHandle (~INeedAHan@39.124.72.106)
[15:45:19] <[twisti]> why are you doing && /bin/bash ?
[15:45:20] <kittonian> nope, the first idea did not work, same crashing
[15:45:34] <kittonian> only because I read that was what I needed to do
[15:45:58] <[twisti]> i would think that would simply open a shell which would then hang forever
[15:46:02] <kittonian> like I said, happy to do whatever to make this work :)
[15:46:11] <[twisti]> where did you read that ? maybe you misunderstood ?
[15:46:22] <kittonian> stackexchange
[15:46:48] <[twisti]> youll have to be a little more precise, theres a few answers there, i wouldnt want to check every single one ;)
[15:47:03] <[twisti]> and what is your end goal here ? why are you building your own docker image in the first place ?
[15:47:51] <kittonian> like i said, i wanted extra things installed in the container that I needed and I didn't want to have to do it manually every time I brought the container down and then up again
[15:48:08] <kittonian> all i want to do is solve this one problem and i'm good. everything else works perfectly
[15:48:13] <tabakhase> kittonian "docker is not a vm" - and using it as such will not end in fun
[15:48:48] <tabakhase> if you need memcached, you should run a memecached container and network that with the rest of the things you need - have a look at docker-compose to streamline such things
[15:49:14] <[twisti]> why do you want these things installed in the container ? nano is an interactive editor, theres really very little reason to have something like that in a docker container, which should be hands off
[15:49:34] <kittonian> ok, can we forget about that stuff and just work on solving my one issue?
[15:49:50] <kittonian> i really appreciate the advice but i just need to solve this one problem and i'm good

[15:51:19] <kittonian> it's really not that weird of a problem. i simply asked how to start a service automatically
[15:51:28] <tabakhase> if you also need memcached, running a memcached container and networking the two is the only "fix" - and one docker run command away from you

[15:51:52] <kittonian> yeah? how exactly do you set that up with nextcloud-fpm?
[15:52:22] <donofrio> kittonian, how long have you used irc?
[15:53:06] <tabakhase> kittonian where/how do you run nextcloud right now? just a bare docker-run or got a compose file already?
[15:53:20] <kittonian> i use docker-compose
[15:54:24] <[twisti]> running a service the right way is a complicated problem, and usually involves more than a single line of code. running a memcached service is a problem that is already solved, via the official memcached docker image. if you want to essentially reinvent that because you prefer to do it that way, then that isnt going to be very interesting to many people
[15:54:30] <tabakhase> then add a service: \n memcached: \n image: memcached - and your nextcloud should be able to contact "memcached:11211" (after a "up" obvs)
[15:54:45] <[twisti]> this is how the official memcached image does it: https://github.com/docker-library/memcached/blob/e0b2a7e2288f313824b2e860d6225d3fd018a7f7/debian/Dockerfile
[15:59:48] <kittonian> tabakhase, thank you. got it all working. a separate memcached container was a better solution

[16:28:29] <tabakhase> "making memcached its own service"? - start with beeing able to just use memcached from the hub then and not having to reengineer the wheel..., in dockerland the hub "is your apt-get replacement" whenever possible. --- but even if we say there is no hub images, you build apache and memcached from debian, youd still keep em on there own cause "why restart memcache when apache updated?" - and 
[16:28:29] <tabakhase> while possible to "run multiple things in one" (by running a full init process, like s6, runit, dumbinit are often seen in docker, or also the now inbuild "--init") - youd never ever just "cmd &;" background things, that leaves zombies if the container tries to stop... there is half a book to write about signal-handling...

[19:52:01] <cemerick> whooo, ssh contexts always use the remote root socket (e.g. `/var/run/docker.sock`), even if the logged-in user has a non-root socket available (e.g. `/run/user/1000/docker.sock`)
[19:52:26] <cemerick> so if I ssh over, and `sudo docker images`, I see the images I've built :-/
[19:54:21] <tabakhase> cemerick tried if DOCKER_HOST works correctly?
[19:55:01] <tabakhase> that technically runs a docker stdin command so it may hit the correct one...
[19:56:21] <cemerick> tabakhase: same semantics; if I set e.g. `DOCKER_HOST="ssh://chas@ranger"`, I see the images visible only to root on the remote box
[19:56:44] <tabakhase> fugly :/
[19:56:57] <cemerick> and if I do `DOCKER_HOST="ssh://chas@ranger/run/user/1000/docker.sock"` (hoping to get it to use the non-root privs), docker commands fail with `ssh host connection is not valid: extra path after the host: "/run/user/1000/docker.sock"`
[19:57:33] <cemerick> yeah, it seems Real Bad to (reasonably) push people to not run under root, but then toss that away when using remote contexts / nonlocal DOCKER_HOSTs

[22:47:49] <kittonian> anyone around today? have an interesting one regarding how apache is going to access files outside of a container
[22:48:00] <kittonian> i've got a container running httpd
[22:48:26] *** Quits: mickey8 (~user@user/mickey) (Quit: Ping timeout (120 seconds))
[22:48:30] <kittonian> in my docker-compose i've volume mapped directories so that the local (outside container) filesystem is mapped properly inside the container
[22:48:43] *** Joins: mickey8 (~user@user/mickey)
[22:49:01] <kittonian> but these are for a few friends of mine that i host their websites and they each have separate usernames specific to their account
[22:49:44] <kittonian> I have chown'd the dirs on the local filesystem correctly and created their user accounts, but since those user accounts don't exist inside the docker container, even though the volume is mapped, apache can't access it because of permissions
[22:49:58] <kittonian> trying to wrap my head around how this should work

[22:54:34] <tabakhase> kittonian well, how would you do it without docker?
[22:56:17] *** Joins: linsux (~metbsd@user/linsux)
[22:56:55] <tabakhase> and then do pretty much the same :P - key is that the kernel just cares about whatever the uid&gids say, so you can align things in&outside as needed
[22:57:19] <kittonian> ahh, so you're saying to use the id instead of the name
[22:57:23] <kittonian> that makes sense
[22:58:41] <tabakhase> names mean nothing ye, in some cases bindmounting (!with :ro !) /etc/passwd & groups can make sense, but thats all just for "you", kernel only cares on numbers - and from there its kinda as if docker doesnt even exist
[22:58:43] <kittonian> nope, that didn't work
[22:59:21] <kittonian> the user id for one of the users is 1003 and docker is mapped so that all id's are 500000 + userid
[22:59:36] <kittonian> so I chown'd 5001003 and it still shows as nobody inside the docker container
[23:00:16] <tabakhase> read what i said about passwd above ;-) -- and with remap obvs none of that applies anymore
[23:01:32] <tabakhase> if you want each to run there own apache, you can just force there apache to be run as there userID from the host and gg
[23:01:34] <kittonian> i understand I can mount /etc/passwd ro but like you said that's only for me to see usernames
[23:01:46] <kittonian> no, i want one apache for these people
[23:01:50] <tabakhase> if you want a shaed one, you have to emulate "www-data" and its group on the hot
[23:01:53] <kittonian> no need to run multiples
[23:02:06] <kittonian> right, and that's what I'm doing for the group
[23:02:18] <kittonian> and that shows as www-data properly (i.e. 500033)
[23:02:22] <tabakhase> and obvs corresponding chmods on the homefolders so www-data (or rather, uid 33 by default?) can descned

[23:03:28] <kittonian> oh, you're saying it's not a chown thing, it's a chmod thing so that even though there are read permissions already, there are also needs to be write permissions?
[23:03:31] <tabakhase> well they dont - they dont hit the "owner" in chmod, but want the "group" bit

[23:04:28] <kittonian> sorry, 775
[23:04:36] <kittonian> is that correct?
[23:06:57] <tabakhase> without your whole setup those arent rly blue/green questions... 
[23:07:41] <kittonian> 775 didn't work either
[23:07:47] <kittonian> the setup is really simple
[23:07:53] <tabakhase> and multi user linux is a little dead anyhow these days... vms for free, every cpu under the sun has vtx... heck the most important part on getting "a server" is ipv4 currently :D
[23:08:04] <kittonian> on the local filesystem you have /web/domain.com/

[23:12:20] <tabakhase> ressources is like 20mb extra ram :P
[23:12:50] <tabakhase> space no is used, images are only stored ONCE (and even shared across different tags, so if you have 15 containers build from debian, you still just store debian once)

[23:20:24] <kittonian> i can show the docker-compose file but i'm not sure how that would help
[23:20:30] <kittonian> it's just a permission issue
[23:20:42] <tabakhase> the dockerfile of your php i mean
[23:20:43] <kittonian> if you want me to pastebin it I'm happy to do so
[23:20:54] <kittonian> php isn't even involved in this question
[23:20:59] <kittonian> so there's no reason to worry about that
[23:21:31] <kittonian> i'm just trying to figure out how to allow apache to write to the logs directory
[23:21:34] <kittonian> that's the big issue
[23:21:55] <tabakhase> you said you "build a custom php for them" up there^^
[23:22:06] <kittonian> forget i said that please
[23:22:15] <kittonian> completely off the topic of this question
[23:22:43] <tabakhase> well lets just say i hope you arent using apt-get in there ;-)
[23:22:58] <kittonian> no worries
[23:23:16] <kittonian> so, back to the permission denied issue
[23:23:35] <kittonian> i've tried chmod'ing the dir to 775 and the files inside to 664 and still permission denied
[23:24:56] <tabakhase> and for your apache you pretty much should have all you need, docker doesnt change a thing in any of this except that "names resolve to rubbish" - if your apache is running as a nobody, either nobody has access to your userdirs (what means also the users within another do), or you do some group-magic to allow to traverse in there (whole path from / needs read&execute for whatever the apache 
[23:24:57] <tabakhase> runs as)
[23:26:34] <tabakhase> given you say 2 others - and yourself? so 3? - so apache cant run as any of those anyhow? so you dont even have another option than nobodying it --- same as it would be on a bare metal debian with www-data
[23:27:04] <kittonian> apache is not running as nobody
[23:27:08] <kittonian> apache is running as www-data
[23:29:21] <tabakhase> guess one hackedy way could be to stackup normally in /var/www - and then bindmount (with chowner flags) into your userdirs - so you dont need to mangle with the homedirs themself...
[23:30:02] <tabakhase> (cause opening up /home/usrname for world and such can be seen ugly)
