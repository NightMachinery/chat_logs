[04:45:37] <Shariff> Hey there
[04:46:21] <Shariff> Is the word Curation a proper word? I was looking in the dictionary and it spoke about the verb to curate or the noun as a clergy member.. but not as a synonym for a collection
[04:50:41] <mdogg> Shariff－ It isn't a synonym for "collection".  It is an individual who looks after a collection.  For example:  "‘I had a chance to talk with a fellow musician about the festival's curation.’"  https://www.lexico.com/en/definition/curation
[04:51:01] <Shariff> Thanks for that!
[04:51:51] <mdogg> Glad to help!
[04:52:59] <mdogg> I misspoke when I stated it was an individual.  A "curator" is the the individual.

[08:15:18] <chlorine> if i don't know somebody's initials or first name but do know their last name, say "Black", is referring to them in the third person as "Mr. Black" more appropriate or should i just say "Black"? i notice the former was the case in the academic literature in the first half of 20th century. 
[08:16:49] <chlorine> so, "i think Mr. Black has made some noteworthy points" or "i think Black has made some noteworthy points"?
[08:18:05] <chlorine> it goes without saying here that the person in question is a male.
[08:29:26] <twb> depends on context
[08:29:46] <chlorine> twb: elaborate, please.
[08:30:15] <twb> e.g. film critic could say "Polanski's later works were weaker" in the middle of an article about Roman Polanski
[08:30:27] <twb> But a lawyer addressing a judge would probably say "Mr. Polanski"
[08:30:57] <chlorine> i like to use the latter in almost all contexts. is that alright?
[08:31:05] <twb> I think so
[08:31:15] <twb> it might come off as a touch officious, but harmless
[08:31:57] <chlorine> i like the feel of the Oxford intellectual indulging in an epistemological discussion in Trans-Atlantic accent if that makes sense ;)

[09:49:49] <kurahaupo> chlorine: In academic writing, it is entirely normal and expectable to cite a work by a single name, usually the surname of its first (or sole) author. (Honorifics are omitted partly because the appropriate honorific may have changed since they wrote the work - indeed it might have changed because99,99 they wrote it.) This includes direct questions like "Black says 'quotes are weird'", indirect quotations like "According t

[09:50:19] <chlorine> kurahaupo: yeah, citations by single name are the norm.
[09:50:47] <kurahaupo> In each of those, you're using the name as a shorthand not for the person, but for a specific work by that person.
[09:51:27] <chlorine> kurahaupo: yeah. i was just making some notes and had to include some person's name but including just the last name didn't sound right, so i asked.

[09:57:31] <kurahaupo> In academic texts, a verbal discussion would be treated as if it was an unpublished written work, and cited the same way. Ordinary writing tends to follow ordinary speech, but then it depends on the social norms where you're writing as to whether you would write "Jeremy Singh", "Mr Singh", "Mr Jeremy Singh", "Jeremy", or "Jerry".
