[00:32:05] <BaronVladimirHar> Windows 11 blocks other browsers (even from the store) from opening links.
[00:32:05] <BaronVladimirHar> Mozilla: Hey, our friends at Microsoft let us into the store! We even get to pay them $500 a year to maintain a developer account, and you can't modify things like user.js!

[01:18:03] <BaronVladimirHar> It's obvious that Microsoft's endgame here is to make it such an uphill battle to use Firefox, or even install it in the first place, that you just won't.
[01:18:03] <BaronVladimirHar> After Microsoft was fiddling with that thing that said it was unsafe to install Firefox and you should just use Edge when it detected the Firefox installer, why is Mozilla giving Microsoft's store free publicity?
[01:18:03] <BaronVladimirHar> It's obvious that they've bought silence.
[01:18:33] <BaronVladimirHar> There are defamation and antitrust lawsuits here in one issue, yet, just, silence from Mozilla.

[01:51:45] <BaronVladimirHar> No....Lots of things you can do to Firefox with a custom user.js.
[01:52:05] <BaronVladimirHar> It was inherited from Seamonkey/Mozilla Suite, which also inherited the concept from Netscape.
[01:52:19] <BaronVladimirHar> I do recall, I think, user.js and prefs.js being in Netscape 4.
[01:52:28] <BaronVladimirHar> The scope of both is much bigger now obviously.
[01:52:44] <BaronVladimirHar> There's MANY APIs in Firefox that aren't all that useful but do add attack surface.

[01:56:20] <BaronVladimirHar> I think pretty much all of these are in Firefox.
[01:56:47] <BaronVladimirHar> But the Arkanfox hardening (and the other one, can't quite remember what it was called) that they use turn this and more off.
[01:57:01] <BaronVladimirHar> And none of these APIs are in GNOME Web because it uses WebkitGTK.

[07:22:11] <BaronVladimirHar> I left it installed a long time after the browser quit working reliably on websites because POP3/SMTP/NNTP didn't change much.
[07:22:49] <BaronVladimirHar> They removed the Calendar from it eventually, but you could go grab it out of an older release and stick it back in, all the way up through the last 4.x release, 4.8.

[15:01:44] <BaronVladimirHar> Makes me wonder how we ended up here where Google or Apple thank their users for patches and bug reports and Mozilla leaves their code to rot and insults users on Bugzilla.
[15:01:54] <ede> on my normal profile noscript is in battle mode
[15:02:26] <ede> it's a bit work after browser restart, but if you don't open a new site every 2 minutes it's ok
[15:03:03] <BaronVladimirHar> I'm torn on the WebKit thing because making it better makes Apple more usable. And Apple is against the users.
[15:03:20] <ede> also you can use DNS to get rid of a lot of tracking and useless scripts. that's pihole and manual hosts entries (also completes lists available on github)
[15:03:31] <BaronVladimirHar> On the other hand, allowing Apple to hide their bugs doesn't help, because nation states will use them.
[15:03:57] <BaronVladimirHar> China attacked people in Hong Kong with a JavaScript engine bug in WebKit, apparently.
[15:05:24] <BaronVladimirHar> Privoxy is still around.
[15:05:47] <ede> "allowing", services want those bugs, only exclusively for themselves. see the problem? ;)
[15:06:10] <ede> and they even deny to undermine security when they buy 0days on the darkweb

[15:06:33] <ede> never had an apple myself and never will
[15:07:19] <ede> where do you see insults against users on bugzilla?
[15:11:00] <Timvde> BaronVladimirHar: you are really delusional if you think Apple and Google accept more user patches than Mozilla
[15:12:00] <BaronVladimirHar> Plenty of people outside Apple have direct commit access to the WebKit source tree.
[15:12:17] <BaronVladimirHar> Including Igalia and the GNOME project.
[15:12:24] <Timvde> But definitely not to the trunk
[15:12:42] <BaronVladimirHar> YES.
[15:12:58] <Timvde> Also, Webkit != the browser

[15:13:26] <BaronVladimirHar> The architecture leaves relatively little for a browser to do.
[15:13:27] <Timvde> Then Gecko also is?
[15:13:43] <Timvde> The engine is mostly irrelevant to most people and how they experience the browser
[15:13:50] <BaronVladimirHar> Epiphany is about 2 MB of compiled code.
[15:14:23] <BaronVladimirHar> Timvde: The second biggest disaster out there. After Blink.
[15:14:32] <TheHermann> ede, this is what i block https://imgur.com/a/oQHdkCA
[15:14:41] <Timvde> Epiphany is also not a pleasant browser to use
[15:14:49] <Timvde> And last time I tried it, it crashed all the time
[15:15:25] *** Joins: The_Blode (~Blode@user/the-blode/x-7164444)
[15:15:57] <BaronVladimirHar> I haven't had any crashes lately.
[15:16:33] <Timvde> It's probably been a year or so
[15:16:39] <BaronVladimirHar> It had a lot of major improvements in the past few years, not the least of which was the complete deletion of that awful browser level ad blocker leftover from Gecko 
[15:16:58] <Timvde> Gecko doesn't have and never had an adblocker built in
[15:17:00] <BaronVladimirHar> It moved that down to WebKit and uses Content Blocker now.
[15:17:06] <BaronVladimirHar> No, it doesn't.
[15:17:31] <Timvde> They never claimed to, is my point
[15:17:39] <BaronVladimirHar> That's why Epiphany had to use an awful ad blocker in the browser itself which stopped making sense once it left Gecko and used a better engine.
[15:17:44] <Timvde> So you shouldn't judge it ad being an adblocker
[15:18:00] <Timvde> I disagree that Webkit is a better engine than Gecko
[15:18:14] <Timvde> It is way behind on standard support
[15:18:19] <BaronVladimirHar> Ad blocking should be provided in the engine, or at least the basic underpinnings for one.
[15:18:53] <BaronVladimirHar> No, Firefox is just better at blindly copying useless crap that invades privacy and runs malware as soon as Google craps it out.
[15:19:24] <BaronVladimirHar> When WebKit outright rejects an API, there are good reasons.
[15:19:51] <Timvde> Mozilla has rejected tons of APIs they think are harmful
[15:19:56] <BaronVladimirHar> https://www.theregister.com/2020/06/29/apple_web_developers/
[15:20:20] <Timvde> See https://mozilla.github.io/standards-positions/
[15:20:29] <BaronVladimirHar> Apple also deleted some that they implemented and then decided we're more of a hazard than they were worth, like web fonts.
[15:20:49] <BaronVladimirHar> Attacks using the font engine are hardly theoretical.
[15:21:28] <BaronVladimirHar> Fonts look so much nicer in WebKit than in Gecko.
[15:22:01] <BaronVladimirHar> Sites should never be allowed to point your browser at random fonts for the font system on your OS to load.
[15:22:12] <Timvde> I don't remember how they look in Webkit, but they look fine in my Firefox?
[15:22:29] <Timvde> Unless you aren't talking about rendering, but just the font that websites serve
[15:22:35] <BaronVladimirHar> If you attempt to block remote fonts in Firefox, you plug this hole, but then you break sites.
[15:22:42] <Timvde> In that case, well, that',s a design choice
[15:22:46] <BaronVladimirHar> Including Reddit and Wine HQ.
[15:23:01] <Timvde> If that's the case, then the same websites are also broken in Webkit
[15:23:22] <BaronVladimirHar> Since this feature isn't in Safari they know not to use it.
[15:23:29] <BaronVladimirHar> So they don't break.
[15:23:42] <BaronVladimirHar> It looks fine.
[15:23:47] <Timvde> I'd imagine the fallback would work for Firefox as well
[15:23:52] <Timvde> Unless they do UA detection
[15:24:00] <Timvde> Which again means the site is just broken
[15:24:31] <BaronVladimirHar> It's more than UA. I tried blocking remote fonts in Firefox and then setting the UA to Safari 15 on Mac OS Monterrey.
[15:24:39] <BaronVladimirHar> And still broken.
[15:24:53] <BaronVladimirHar> Seems they sniff deeper than the UA string for this one.
[15:25:01] <Timvde> I'm out for lunch now, so afk
[15:26:31] <BaronVladimirHar> Web Midi. Crap. Should be rejected outright.
[15:27:48] <BaronVladimirHar> It enables fingerprint attacks and let's malicious sites go looking for more stuff to exploit.
[15:30:39] <BaronVladimirHar> The harmful category is.... I don't disagree with Mozilla, but they fold like a cheap card table.

[15:35:02] <BaronVladimirHar> The Linux kernel hasn't updated the module in a while. When Debian has a 5.16 kernel, I'll be switching from lz4 to zstd for my zswap compressor.
[15:35:02] <lembron> how the fuck is it soooo impossible to change the language of firefox? and i do NOT mean the "accept language shit it sends" but the actual language of the browser UI
[15:35:07] <lembron> seems sheer impossible todo

[15:36:24] <t4nk_freenode> english?
[15:36:29] <t4nk_freenode> never hoid of it
[15:36:38] <BaronVladimirHar> Being super fast is more important to zswap and zram than maximum compression. If you add more jank than just swapping to the SSD, there's no reason to use it.
[15:36:47] <BaronVladimirHar> In the context of the web it's the same.
[15:37:15] <BaronVladimirHar> But zstd can. Solve a couple problems on the web.
[15:37:46] <BaronVladimirHar> Not the least of which is web browser performance trying to decompress items from the server.

[21:27:44] <BaronVladimirHar> Mozilla is inconsistent.
[21:28:23] <BaronVladimirHar> On some level, they must agree with me that sites that break themselves on purpose lose the privilege of expecting a correct UA and correct CSS vendor prefix support.
[21:28:56] <BaronVladimirHar> But they won't do anything and defer to the website when it's Facebook UA sniffing and breaking Facebook Messenger Live Video chats for 3 years.
[21:29:51] <BaronVladimirHar> The Mozilla employee who insulted me and then marked my posts as spam instead of assuming good faith when I said I was annoyed that this went on for so long is why I just deleted my Bugzilla account.
[21:30:16] <BaronVladimirHar> To an extent, he's correct. You should reach out to the site owner.
[21:30:28] <WaltS48> You go Baron. Give em helk
[21:30:35] <BaronVladimirHar> But having this go on for three years while they recommend your competitor and break the site entirely is not okay.
[21:30:53] <BaronVladimirHar> The time for talk is over when they let this go on without replying to you for THAT long.
[21:31:21] <BaronVladimirHar> I'd say if you're a company the size of Mozilla and Facebook won't talk to you and fix the issue inside of a week or two, give them a fake UA.

[22:27:01] <BaronVladimirHar> I wasn't born yesterday.
[22:27:10] <BaronVladimirHar> I had one of the first ad blocking HOSTS files.
[22:27:13] <BaronVladimirHar> I was the maintainer.
[22:27:20] <dalias> that's nice
[22:27:28] <BaronVladimirHar> There was no software to do that yet, so I did that.
[22:27:33] <dalias> i can't even tell what you're upset about. but whatever it is, it's not firefox

[22:28:14] <dalias> and don't login with facebook
[22:28:14] <BaronVladimirHar> Windows 98 had this crazy limit of 150 KB or so, if you went over it the HOSTS file made things very slow.
[22:29:26] <BaronVladimirHar> I found that not only did 0.0.0.0 fail lookups faster, it reduced the size of the file. So I did that, and then prioritized the worst/most prevalent ad networks, and then I found I had space left, so I went after the ads in AOL Instant Messenger, MSN Messenger, Yahoo Messenger, and all of the major adware, like Gator, new dot net, and the rest.
[22:30:16] <dalias> i like how your ramblings have nothing to do with the claim that firefox is broken
