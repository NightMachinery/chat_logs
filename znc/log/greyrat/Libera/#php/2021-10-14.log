[02:27:02] <Slartiba1t> If I run 'composer search <some package name star pattern>' then does composer only look in the master branch in the repo? Composer.json for the project that I'm trying to install has a bunch of require lines on the format '"asd/package" : "dev-branchname#commit"'. If I check the repo in bitbucket web GUI those branches are there, but I can't see that the dependencies are downloaded..
[02:27:56] <Sammitch> composer search won't touch git at all, it just pokes through the data provided by the composer repo
[02:28:05] <Sammitch> eg: packagist
[02:29:04] <Sammitch> if you want to test if the user that you're running composer as can access those repos, then try to check them out manually with git, or try just installing one of the packages
[02:29:44] <Sammitch> IIRC composer has no provision for specifying git credentials, it falls back entirely on what is configured for that user
[02:32:47] <Slartiba1t> Sammitch: There's bitbucket-oauth (https://getcomposer.org/doc/articles/authentication-for-private-packages.md#manual-bitbucket-oauth), which I thought I had configured. But I guess I should doublecheck that.

[07:33:26] <benl90-> Hello, I've simple question, how to limit php cli open_basedir only to the homedir of account that run the php cli? is that possible? Thanks
[07:40:50] <LordOfThePings> https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.chroot.php perhaps
[07:41:00] <LordOfThePings> Changes the root directory of the current process to directory, and changes the current working directory to "/".
[07:41:22] <LordOfThePings> So it should lock the process into that chroot dir
[07:41:30] <Blondie101010> that would indeed be an option, though not directly what's asked
[07:41:36] <LordOfThePings> Then when you open basedir after it, / should be that dir
[07:41:46] <Rockwood> root directory
[07:42:03] <Blondie101010> benl90-:  if all users are in /home/$user and the permissions are sane, setting open_basedir to /home would do the job
[07:43:18] <Blondie101010> '.' is another option, but it can be cheated
[07:43:20] <Rockwood> permission should be on require file and reasonable  user
[07:44:03] <Blondie101010> to be honest, if the user is allowed to read a file, they'll also be able to copy it, so limiting that doesn't have much benefit, if any!
[07:44:26] <benl90-> Blondie101010, ah that make sense, all is on /home/$user, but on open_basedir we can't use $user right?
[07:44:35] <jargon> Blondie101010, see "dggr"? How would I make that multiple numeric groups? like foo1 foo2 foo3 for up to 15 optional groups? https://regex101.com/r/hinwiN/11/
[07:44:36] <Blondie101010> no
[07:44:48] <LordOfThePings> That would make it a certain user's home directory
[07:44:58] <LordOfThePings> /home would be the 'base' directory for users.
[07:45:02] <Blondie101010> jargon:  ask #regex
[07:45:24] <benl90-> LordOfThePings, but that means we can't limit to each user?
[07:45:27] <benl90-> only /home
[07:45:37] <LordOfThePings> Hence the chroot.
[07:45:51] <Blondie101010> LordOfThePings:  yes, and my point about sane permissions involves that other users can't read each others home
[07:46:06] <Blondie101010> but yes the chroot does go a step beyond that
[07:46:28] <benl90-> LordOfThePings, how to implement chroot, I only get that this function is work if we autoload the script to each script that run?
[07:46:49] <Blondie101010> benl90-:  no, you'd give the user a chrooted environment
[07:47:03] <Blondie101010> so that when they log in, they are in an isolated part of your /
[07:47:47] <benl90-> oh... I get it... so like rbash or such?
[07:47:55] <Blondie101010> no
[07:48:04] <Blondie101010> it fakes /
[07:48:18] <LordOfThePings> You'd set chroot("/home/$user/") and then / would be that user's home directory. Put this in somewhere in the start of your script that loads other scripts. However you have it.
[07:48:22] <Blondie101010>  / could point to /home/benl90
[07:49:03] <Blondie101010> setting this is, though not very complicated, is not easy, and very off topic here
[07:49:18] <jgrim> Are you doing some shared hosting or something?
[07:49:42] <benl90-> Blondie101010, I see, but does the function of php that mentioned by LordOfThePings directly can be used or I need extra step for it?
[07:49:52] <LordOfThePings> That may throw off your other programs, who knows
[07:50:09] <Blondie101010> benl90-:  chroot is not a PHP function, though php-fpm can set it up for its own process
[07:50:34] <LordOfThePings> You can set open_basedir to /home/$user/ as mentioned previously
[07:50:51] <LordOfThePings> If you can give us more information on why you're trying to do what, we can probably guide better.
[07:51:01] <benl90-> jgrim, no I just want to restrict each user, because by default :/proc/meminfo already set and I think it should work as intended, just suddenly today it's cause laravel can't open vendor dir on its own folder.
[07:51:26] <LordOfThePings> So the problem is with Laravel reading the vendor folder and not chrooting?
[07:51:36] <LordOfThePings> Can you be exact in what's the issue?
[07:51:57] <Blondie101010> not following either
[07:52:38] <benl90-> It's throwing error /home/foo/web/domain.com/public_html/vendor/autoload.php can't be opened because not part of open_basedir using /usr/bin/php command, I run cron using laravel scheduler.
[07:53:14] <benl90-> but this never happened before, autoload use require function, I mean the artisan command (the php artisan)
[07:53:25] <Blondie101010> echo ini_get("open_basedir");
[07:53:38] <Blondie101010> or actually write it to a file
[07:53:44] <Blondie101010> and run the cron job
[07:54:09] <benl90-> the basedir is open_basedir = ":/proc/meminfo"
[07:54:23] <Blondie101010> if you're offering any access to your server to third parties, you should hire a sysadmin
[07:54:36] <Blondie101010> why /proc/meminfo?
[07:54:36] <benl90-> not I uncomment it first so the cron could run, but this never happend before. I'm the sysadmin sadly... *sob
[07:54:51] <Blondie101010> my point stands!
[07:55:02] <Blondie101010> you'll have a lot of trouble
[07:55:12] <benl90-> Blondie101010, it's default from andreonerj repo of ubuntu
[07:55:37] <Blondie101010> I seriously doubt that but can't check right now
[07:55:39] <benl90-> Blondie101010, ehm, I don't get the context of 2 last sentences, could you rephrase it for me in simple way?
[07:56:01] <Blondie101010> no
[07:56:22] <Blondie101010> hmmm
[07:57:06] <Blondie101010> you hide all the context, so I won't persist on comments about it without knowing anything
[07:57:12] <Blondie101010> I already made a clear comment
[07:59:00] <benl90-> ehm, sorry, what context?
[07:59:18] <Blondie101010> [00:24:22] <Blondie101010> if you're offering any access to your server to third parties, you should hire a sysadmin
[07:59:48] <Blondie101010> explaining it would basically be insulting you
[08:00:11] <Blondie101010> (not the intention)
[08:01:09] <Rockwood> benl90-, Blondie101010 also very good in sysadmin idk she like or not freelancing
[08:01:36] <Blondie101010> that's not important here
[08:01:38] <benl90-> Oh. I see.. I get it. Thank you. that mean my knowledge isn't sufficient enough than. Thanks.
[08:01:52] <Blondie101010> but you can learn
[08:02:09] <benl90-> ah, take Zend certification?
[08:02:20] <Blondie101010> to become a sysadmin?
[08:02:49] <benl90-> No for this condition. I already has some Red Hat certified thing for basic linux
[08:03:19] <Blondie101010> sadly proving how useless certs are
[08:03:19] <Rockwood> but your question not shows that
[08:03:58] <Rockwood> certification always good for get new jobs
[08:04:26] *** Joins: genomc (uid245282@id-245282.hampstead.irccloud.com)
[08:04:27] <benl90-> anyway, so the only way is to do chroot right as LordOfThePings state before
[08:04:27] <Blondie101010> they help to compensate for experience
[08:04:30] <Rockwood> in real you have to collect knowledge correctly that is matter
[08:04:41] <Blondie101010> benl90-:  you still didn't answer on what this is about
[08:05:06] <Blondie101010> if it's for shared hosting, you need to hire a sysadmin now
[08:05:53] <benl90-> the open_basedir? I just want to limit to the directory that user access, and it's not shared hosting, it's internal one, It's okay to let it open to any folder, just I felt not secure enough to some dev that sometimes mess around
[08:06:15] <Blondie101010> then you don't need it
[08:06:46] <Blondie101010> open_basedir is not that usefull, and it doesn't protect any files
[08:07:06] <Blondie101010> the user could just copy the file over and use it
[08:07:11] <Blondie101010> so what does it change?
[08:07:19] <Blondie101010> more disk use for nothing?
[08:07:32] <Rockwood> i don't have certificates and i don't have job too :D
[08:07:59] <benl90-> Blondie101010, Hmm.. so I just let it open for cli is okay right. because everyone that access the server is dev. I can set it per vhost so when some dev do make hole on their code at least it doesn't go anywhere. I already have selinux enabled so at least on low level it won't do crazy thing.
[08:08:17] <benl90-> Rockwood, nah.. you have one
[08:08:32] <benl90-> Blondie101010, but that provide me with answer. anyway thank you.
[08:09:05] <Blondie101010> benl90-:  you should not need open_basdir anywhere in that kind of environment...  it does NOT provide any real security
[08:10:38] <Rockwood> benl90-, really i am unemployed
[08:10:40] <Blondie101010> but how do they test their scripts on HTTP?  don't they use a common DOCROOT?
[08:10:47] <Blondie101010> Rockwood:  #phpc
[08:10:58] <Rockwood> he is not there
[08:11:04] <Blondie101010> NOT the point
[08:11:58] <Rockwood> anyway time to leave the computer
[08:12:07] <Rockwood> my shop time
[08:12:10] <Rockwood> oops
[08:12:12] <benl90-> Blondie101010, why dev colleague ?
[08:12:14] <Rockwood> tc cya
[08:12:24] *** LordOfThePings is now known as EnchanterTim
[08:12:39] <Rockwood> [10:12:29] <benl90-> Blondie101010, why dev colleague ?  means?
[08:13:06] <benl90-> sorry, my dev colleague testing script on HTTP?
[08:13:17] <Blondie101010> or is there a vhost per user on that machine?
[08:13:36] <benl90-> vhost on some user, so like staging
[08:13:43] <benl90-> staging.domains.com
[08:13:44] <Blondie101010> staging is not a user
[08:13:54] <Blondie101010> hmmm
[08:14:00] <benl90-> yeah I know. but I mean user has many vhost
[08:14:01] <Blondie101010> sounds very badly organized
[08:14:31] <benl90-> for each user, but this's out of the #php scope right? do we need to go to #phpc?
[08:15:03] <benl90-> Blondie101010, well they pay me so low, so I just do duct tape. It shouldn't be like that honestly. well forget it.
[08:15:08] <Rockwood> lol still we are off-topic here
[08:15:27] <benl90-> yeah. sorry :')
[08:15:35] <dag> open_basedir is like a helmet when you are walking. it's probably not necessary. also post verbatim error. should be easily debuggable
[08:16:30] <Blondie101010> more like a baseball cap
[08:17:58] <benl90-> dag, Rockwood, Blondie101010, Thanks. seems Lord of the pings left already
[08:19:27] <Rockwood> you can me anytime :D i don't mind

[08:21:02] <Blondie101010> that ^^ in private
[08:21:27] <dag> whats the current value of open_basedir
[08:22:08] <benl90-> dag, haha... done already. I set it allow all, as it's only for staging, and some dev, so let them do whatever they want. I only control the rest via selinux

[17:55:30] <Byteflux> biberu: With regards to Windows... I most of the time would assume that people use Windows for development, not production. Such people are also more likely than non-Windows users (I assume) to use Apache for development instead of the built-in server.
[17:56:26] <AllenJB> I'd go as far as to wager most of them are using XAMPP or similar
[17:56:29] <Byteflux> Just my perception, any way. And relating to ZTS, that's the only reason I can see why ZTS PHP would be "preferred" on Windows.
[17:56:52] <biberu> Byteflux: i read your comment as non-windows users using the built in server
[17:57:06] <Byteflux> Now I personally also use Windows for development, but I only use the PHP CLI or built-in server so I only need to use the NTS PHP.

[17:58:41] <Byteflux> not LAMP :P
[17:58:45] <biberu> also, it can be good to avoid relying on your host system even if you're running linux, keeping projects in vms or containers makes it much easier to control the environment
[18:00:19] <Byteflux> biberu: If I had to guess, probably a disproportionate number of non-Windows developers are using stacks that use the built-in server for development, not sure exactly, but just a perception.

[18:05:10] <Byteflux> Or `php artisan serve` in Laravel which does basically the same thing, if I remember.

[19:10:12] <Byteflux> A more accurate example/explanation of your goal with closures could lead to better advice, but in general pass-by-reference indicates a bad decision :P
[19:14:00] <__adrian> "i don't like using brackets for single sublines"  right, i noticed  ;)
[19:15:16] <__adrian> it's up to you, of course, but it's not a "style" suggestion. code without brackets is less obvious, which makes it less maintainable in the long term.

[22:06:19] <Blondie101010> there are various ways to handle files in PHP
[22:07:09] <Blondie101010> looking for a 'standard' typically denotes some obscure unmentioned requirement or lack of confidence
[22:07:17] <pcfreak30> I more of mean an OOP route.
[22:07:27] <Albright> Lack of confidence in my case :)
[22:07:30] <Blondie101010> sure no difference
[22:07:41] <Sammitch> you should give a bit more detail on what you mean by "filesystem abstraction"
[22:07:52] <pcfreak30> I see Psr7* for anything http, but nothing past the various scattered fs api procedural functions
[22:07:54] <Sammitch> before we run away with our assumptions

[22:08:31] <Blondie101010> bah
[22:08:44] <Byteflux> Not a standard in the PHP-FIG sense with PSR's, but a part of the Standard PHP Library (SPL)
[22:09:26] <pcfreak30> yes thats what i was asking
[22:09:33] <Blondie101010> that kind of shows how looking for "standards" doesn't result in "better" or more "appropriate"

[22:10:48] <Blondie101010> defining a proper structure for your *desired* file access is where you should start, then you can use whatever you like to build it with
[22:11:24] <Sammitch> I mean that's also not really what I would call abstraction, it's just aliasing all the file IO functions into a class definition. :/
[22:11:53] <Blondie101010> if all you want is replace `fgets($fp...)` by `$fp->fgets()`, sure
[22:12:12] <Byteflux> It's "abstract" enough I think, given the scope of "filesystem" :P
[22:12:14] <Sammitch> oh god, it's the mysqli of file io @_@
[22:12:25] <Blondie101010> it's not abstracted at all
[22:12:37] <Byteflux> Streams are definitely more of an abstraction over IO
[22:12:43] <Sammitch> ^
[22:12:45] <Blondie101010> definitely
[22:13:13] <Blondie101010> but they may not be the best candidate for the unknown requirements
[22:13:14] <pcfreak30> I was asking as I will likely be writing a filesystem interface to a storage system and wanted to use any standards that  existed.
[22:13:20] <Sammitch> ok now do an SplString class :3c
[22:14:02] <Blondie101010> pcfreak30:  that part will be the less important part of your code
[22:14:17] <Byteflux> You should probably define the Storage interface first.
[22:14:43] <Blondie101010> sounds like a high level simili-ORM
[22:15:26] <Blondie101010> therefore likely reinventing the wheel and a motor
[22:16:11] <Byteflux> You might be able to just have a stream-based storage interface with files being just one possible implementation.

[22:18:46] <Blondie101010> I found one, which was already abandonned
[22:19:13] <Byteflux> File per object is not necessarily a bad approach for many use cases.
[22:19:15] <Albright> Anything other than SQLite would be reinventing wheels. :)
[22:19:21] <Blondie101010> that's an option, but not fitting the typical requirements of a flat file DB infrastructure

[22:35:17] <Blondie101010> oh it is without specific requirements, that at the time involves very limited hardware
[22:35:35] <Blondie101010> *involved
[22:36:54] <Albright> It has its place. I personally think SQLite is underused (which is kinda funny since it's already one of the most used RDBMSes on the planet) in that many smaller sites which use MySQL could be better suited by SQLite.
[22:38:07] <Sammitch> I'm still a little iffy on how well SQLite stands up to concurrent access, if I'm being honest
[22:38:17] <Sammitch> I have MS Access flashbacks
[22:38:49] <Sammitch> "up to 1024 concurrent accesses" but realistically 10 would cause it to lock up
[22:39:21] <Albright> No issues at all for reads. The whole file is locked for writes. If your site does far more reads than writes, as is the typical case for web sites, SQLite could theoretically be faster than traditional RDBMSes.
[22:40:02] <Albright> But yes, if you have to do a lot of writes/logging, SQLite isn't the best if you'll have a lot of concurrent users.
[22:40:22] <Blondie101010> the bottom line to that point is that it's suitable for small projects
[22:40:45] <Blondie101010> if it gets bigger, you need the flexibility of a more sophisticated system
[22:41:46] <Blondie101010> considering that switching to another SQL RDBMS would be very easy, it's actually a sane idea

[23:37:29] <Byteflux> DBs dont actually handle power failures. They can minimize their impact, but a sudden failure can still break data consistency.
[23:37:30] <Albright> If we're still talking about SQLite, there aren't really any buffers to flush once the "connection" is closed.
[23:38:35] <Byteflux> Even the most perfect database mitigation will at the very least lead to a rollback of some kind in the best case scenario where consistency was disrupted from power failure.
[23:39:26] <da_wunder> I would use sqlite only for data that really doesn't matter - no harm done if some of that data is lost and so on
[23:39:45] <da_wunder> if that is not the use case, use proper database
[23:40:03] <Albright> You seem to have mixed up SQLite and MongoDB. :P
[23:40:10] <Sammitch> FWIW I'm talking about "proper" RDBMSes with transactions and transaction logs, and I agree with ByteFlux. I also consider unexpected outages to be a separate case from a backup. if my backup process loses transactions, then it's a bad backup process.
[23:40:26] <da_wunder> Albright: imho those both are in the same pool
[23:40:39] <Albright> Well, then you misunderstand SQLite.
[23:40:48] <Sammitch> ^
[23:41:26] <Byteflux> Sammitch: Yes, backups should absolutely be done by tools that are database-aware, not by taking a snapshot of the database's filesystem storage
[23:41:42] <Sammitch> MongoDB is unique in that it explicitly does not give a shit about consistency
[23:42:16] <Sammitch> which is funny because MongoDB cluster replciation is incredibly picky about consistency :P
[23:42:55] <da_wunder> might be, last I check sqlite is just using one file for the whole "database" and you cannot use transactions with that - so please tell if those are wrong
[23:43:06] <da_wunder> s/wrong/not true
[23:43:14] <Albright> Obligatory: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2F-DItXtZs
[23:43:51] <Sammitch> there's no point in implementing transactions in an RDBMS that inherently does not have concurrent writes.
[23:44:20] <Sammitch> like mandating seatbelts in a car that's bolted to the ground
[23:44:42] <Albright> SQLite does support them anyway though. :P
[23:44:45] <Byteflux> You can have multiple readers though.
[23:44:45] <Albright> https://www.sqlite.org/lang_transaction.html
[23:44:55] <Byteflux> So transactions for read consistency still matters, I would think
[23:45:04] <Albright> Yes.
[23:45:09] <Sammitch> hey lookit that
[23:45:37] <Albright> Oh, another reason why
[23:45:51] <Albright> I like SQLite: their doc pages are awesome.
[23:46:02] <da_wunder> and without concurrent writes you might be blocking other users to do that same thing
[23:46:22] <Albright> da_wunder: Yes. We discussed that above. SQLite will be slow if you have to do a lot of writing.
[23:46:30] <Albright> But you won't lose data.
[23:46:36] <Byteflux> SQLite isn't trying to be a replacement for PostgreSQL or MySQL.
[23:46:50] <Sammitch> ITT: "if sqlite doesn't fit your use case you shouldn't use it"
[23:47:39] <da_wunder> Byteflux: and that is the main question - why to even bother to use something like that, when you've better choices to use?
[23:47:48] <Albright> Corollary: SQLite probably fits your use case if you have a web site that isn't swamped with users. :)
[23:47:49] <Byteflux> Or "it has limitations that disqualify it for my use case, therefore it sucks"
[23:48:09] <Byteflux> da_wunder: Because like Sammitch said, there are use cases for it. When it fits your use case, use it. When it doesn't, don't.
[23:48:31] <Albright> da_wunder: It does really fast reads, and most sites do more reading than writing, and it's very easy to do backups. Those are the advantages IMO.
[23:49:53] <da_wunder> Byteflux: that is true, but really I don't see point to use that when you've better choices to use
[23:50:05] <Sammitch> do you use your car to visit your friend down the street, or do you just walk? don't you know cars are much more confortable?
[23:50:11] <Byteflux> "Better" is a loaded term, here.
[23:50:25] <Sammitch> or would that just be overkill?
[23:50:26] <Byteflux> There are many factors at play that could make SQLite the "better" choice
[23:50:33] <Byteflux> How exactly are you quantifying "better?"
[23:50:45] <Albright> exactly. I think SQLite *is* the better choice in many cases.
[23:51:21] <da_wunder> ok, so this is not going anywhere... let just agree that we disagree with this one
[23:51:24] <Albright> But whatever. Use whatever you feel comfortable with. Just don't do so based on mistaken ideas like "SQLite causes data loss."
[23:51:30] <Sammitch> Albright: but everyone thinks they're making the next F*cebook and have to be ready for one million concurrent users right out of the gate
[23:51:47] <Albright> lol yup
[23:51:50] <Byteflux> Sammitch: Or using your car to drive when there's only a sidewalk/bike lane with no road.
[23:52:32] <Byteflux> I guess Android shouldn't use SQLite as its default database either.
[23:52:43] <Byteflux> Obviously running a MySQL server on your phone is better.
[23:52:51] <Albright> Speaking of which, I wonder how many companies built their infrastructure on MongoDB back when it was the second coming of data and have wondered why data just mysteriously goes missing now and then over the last ten years
[23:53:12] <da_wunder> huoh, phone applications are totally different animals versus web applications...
[23:53:16] <Sammitch> Byteflux: but what if I have 1000 concurrent users on my phone?
[23:53:41] <da_wunder> and with phone application that makes really sense - there is just _one_ user for that local data
[23:53:44] <Sammitch> Albright: please no, I already had to stab my leg with a fork to stop from bitching about mungus for an hour
[23:54:28] <Sammitch> Mongo is a glorified cache daemon that got WAY out of control
[23:55:27] <Albright> I still can't believe they got away with naming a major software product after a slur against the mentally disabled. I presume most of its serious users/developers are not native English speakers. But other projects have been cancelled for far less…
[23:56:00] <Byteflux> Mongo is just having a bit of an identity crisis, that's all. Wants to be relational without being relational.
[23:56:24] <Albright> As an introvert I guess I can relate
[23:56:33] <Byteflux> But it does a decent job for what it is. I just don't see myself using a hybrid.
[23:56:58] <Byteflux> Either my use case fits perfectly into a RDBMS or there's a better document-oriented database solution
[23:57:11] <Byteflux> But Mongo tries to do both and masters neither.
[23:57:50] <da_wunder> and relational databases are adding more document kind of features...
