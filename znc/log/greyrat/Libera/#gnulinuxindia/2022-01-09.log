[08:41:16] <glizzster[m]1> its not installin
[08:41:23] <glizzster[m]1> i tried git and normal version
[08:41:28] <glizzster[m]1> both arent working
[08:53:30] <JB[m]> <pystardust> "* I have decided to stop youtube..." <- Why
[09:08:33] <pystardust> NeoVoid[m]: books books books, i have been ignoring them for other dopamine sources. But yeah now ill read. :). gtlsgamr ur blog inspired me to delete yt and all. JB[m] read this https://hitarththummar.xyz/posts/writings/death_of_long_form_media.html . i usually enjoy watching educational stuff only. if i wanna have fun id rather watch a tv show downloaded. And yt is the worst for getting educated compared to the addiction
[09:08:33] <pystardust> and shitty content.
[09:11:39] <pal[m]> <pystardust> "* I have decided to stop youtube..." <- One blog I'd suggest would be julia evans's blog
[09:11:53] <pal[m]> She has some really interesting stuff

[09:13:12] <pystardust> Thanks! 
[09:13:31] <pal[m]> Np
[09:16:41] <JB[m]> <pystardust> "Neo Void: books books books, i..." <- Website is dowm @gtlsgamer 
[09:16:41] <JB[m]> @pystardust  bro what are you doing. Theres lot of good stuff too on youtube as well. Just stick to the " good stuff"
[09:16:41] <JB[m]> If its a fight against proprietary. Then its a different thing.
[09:20:52] <JB[m]> <pal[m]> "http://jvns.ca/" <- Niiice
[09:23:25] <pystardust> JB[m]: i agree there are, but its a dirty place, if ur truly educational u cant be successful on yt, people need to appeal to other means. There are very few exceptions, but i doubt its worth it compared to text alternatives
[09:23:55] <pystardust> Fighting abt proprietary is also a factor
[09:29:44] <Arya[m]123> i agree for the most part
[09:29:55] <Arya[m]123> but too lazy to read books and stuff :)
[09:33:22] <pystardust> I agree the laziness is there. But tbh the laziness cames because we are used to immediate dopamine. This is not good, we need to control outself and read books
[09:52:16] <pal[m]> Yeah I completely agree
[09:52:53] <pal[m]> Even Ive noticed that if the person talking about the topic isn't entertaining enough I don't pay much attention
[09:53:19] <pal[m]> That shouldn't be the case for consuming information

[12:04:45] <Arya[m]123> gtlsgamr: is it possible to use d/m/y in hugo
[12:05:23] <gtlsgamr[m]> Yes to both.
[13:25:54] <Arya[m]123> ok
[13:25:57] <Arya[m]123> but how for the latter
[13:36:36] <pystardust> Arya[m]:  the date formatting in Hugo docs and edit the appropriate layouts

[17:45:31] <gtlsgamr> Hi all
[17:45:33] <gtlsgamr> how is it going
[17:45:42] <Arya[m]123> hi
[17:45:44] <Arya[m]123> good 
[17:45:51] <Arya[m]123> started work on my synapse blog post
[17:50:52] <NeoVoid[m]> Can anyone clarify this:
[17:50:53] <NeoVoid[m]>  If you are on call with ram in sim1 and other person shyam calls you on sim2 would you get call notification and have ability to hold and accept that call or that person couldnt able to connect you?
[17:54:04] <NeoVoid[m]> In my example this user has jio on sim1 and airtel on sim2. 
[17:54:04] <NeoVoid[m]> he can see another call notification if calling with same sim company but not with different sim company.
[17:54:24] <Arya[m]123> not sure
[17:54:38] <Arya[m]123> probably depends on phone 
[17:54:41] <Arya[m]123> i mean rom
[17:58:33] <NeoVoid[m]> Arya[m]123: did you get call notification if you are having call with someone and another person try to call on your second sim?
[17:58:53] <Arya[m]123> i dont even use my phone that much and i use only one sim

[18:48:38] <NeoVoid[m]> like using telegram frontend for custom matric server

[18:51:10] <NeoVoid[m]> so "proprietary backend of telegram" issue will be resolved.

[21:10:08] <SurajKushwah[m]> hey guys , can you tell me in gnome gdm how to autostart applications?
[21:10:08] <SurajKushwah[m]> which I start in xinitrc?
[21:12:23] <NeoVoid[m]> > <Suraj Kushwah> hey guys , can you tell me in gnome gdm how to autostart applications?
[21:12:23] <NeoVoid[m]> > which I start in xinitrc?
[21:12:23] <NeoVoid[m]> i think there should be "startup application" named program which can be found with search in activities.
[21:12:32] <NeoVoid[m]> or in settings.
[21:13:03] <NeoVoid[m]> * i think there should be "Startup Application Preferences" named program which can be found with search in activities.
[21:13:11] <SurajKushwah[m]> umm. I am using dwm
[21:13:16] <SurajKushwah[m]> don't tell me ..it have some GUI
[21:13:38] <NeoVoid[m]> SurajKushwah[m]: you said gnome
[21:13:55] <NeoVoid[m]> SurajKushwah[m]: obviously lol
[21:13:55] <SurajKushwah[m]> gnome and dwm both on ubuntu.
[21:14:15] <NeoVoid[m]> ohh so you want to add dwm in sessions?
[21:14:23] <SurajKushwah[m]> i did add .
[21:14:28] <SurajKushwah[m]> just how to start some program
[21:16:26] <NeoVoid[m]> i guess gui is the way unless if i am wrong just like openbox there should be folder in .config/autostart where you write a script just like .xprofile
[21:16:33] <NeoVoid[m]> * i am not wrong just
[21:18:11] <NeoVoid[m]> SurajKushwah[m]: wait if your .xinitrc file not working then create similar file named .xprofile in $home
[21:18:47] <NeoVoid[m]> .xinitrc does not work with gdm or sdm
[21:42:04] <mysticbtw[m]> https://github.com/notprash/manga-cli
[21:45:30] <SurajKushwah[m]> Does zprofile works with display manager
[21:54:31] <mysticbtw[m]> <NeoVoid[m]> "wait if your .xinitrc file not..." <- this here should do. 
[21:54:31] <mysticbtw[m]> .xprofile (not bash or z)
[21:58:35] <mysticbtw[m]> or since you said gnome, its uses gdm
[21:58:35] <mysticbtw[m]> from this also
[21:58:35] <mysticbtw[m]>  
[21:58:35] <mysticbtw[m]> /etc/gdm/Xsession
[21:58:47] <mysticbtw[m]> s/its/it/
[23:04:56] <pystardust> SurajKushwah[m]: xprofile kinda thingy works
[23:06:04] <pystardust> zprofile won't work, its when u enter a tty, but when using a display manager things work different
[23:09:41] <pystardust> Or just use this file https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/XDG_Autostart , put stuff in bg just like xinitrc
