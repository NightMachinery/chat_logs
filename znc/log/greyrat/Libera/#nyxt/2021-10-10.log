[22:35:33] <dije> waleee: edgarvincent[m]: This is me using Nyxt installed from your repo tarball on Manjaro. Sweet.
[22:36:03] <dije> Now it begins.
[22:36:47] <dije> Anyone got a good solution for org-capture from nyxt?
[22:41:02] <waleee> dije: https://ag91.github.io/blog/2021/07/09/org-capture-in-nyxt-taking-notes-while-browsing/
[22:42:00] *** Joins: sarab (~sarab@103.210.200.98)
[22:48:54] <dije> @walee: Thanks. Before I commit to that approach, is there a known-good solution using org-protocol? Now that I've got it working in Conkeror, Chromium and Firefox, I don't want to lose it. I feel like I should be able to re-use my existing org-protocol/XDG integration with Nyxt fairly easily.
[22:49:39] <waleee> I remember seeing someone else doing another implementation, but I can't swear it used that approach
[22:52:57] <waleee> ah, no, fairly sure they weren't using org-protocol from looking at https://orgmode.org/manual/Protocols.html
[22:54:03] <waleee> dije: oh, or wait, capture was part of it. Then ambrevar has it in his config, https://gitlab.com/ambrevar/dotfiles/-/blob/master/.config/nyxt/init.lisp#L18
[22:58:00] <dije> waleee: Thanks, I've seen that in code in the blog post you linked earlier, it invokes org-capture in what I would call a semi-automated way.
[22:58:15] <dije> Here's the crucial line of JS from my .conkerorrc:
[22:58:41] <dije>   const cmd_str = `${emacsclient_executable} ` +
[22:58:41] <dije>         `'org-protocol://capture?template=w&url=${url}&title=${title}` +
[22:58:42] <dije>         `&body=${selection}'`;
[22:59:03] <dije> I want to be able to use something like that if at all possible.
[22:59:30] <waleee> dije: you can execute that fairly easy from nyxt
[23:00:20] <dije> The solution you showed makes me manually select the "w" template, which is an unnecessary extra step (or should be)
[23:00:41] <dije> OK, so I'll make that a project.
[23:01:03] <dije> Do we have the concept of packages for Nyxt?
[23:03:36] <waleee> there's a concept of extensions, aartaka has examples of a couple in his config https://github.com/aartaka/nyxt-config
[23:04:13] <waleee> eg https://github.com/aartaka/nx-kaomoji
[23:04:35] <waleee> dije: but this would be achieved in just a couple of lisp lines
[23:07:41] <waleee> dije: https://gitlab.com/ambrevar/dotfiles/-/blob/master/.config/nyxt/init.lisp#L12
[23:07:50] <dije> So just a do-shell-command (or equivalent)
[23:08:11] <dije> waleee: you are a fount of good information
[23:08:16] <waleee> essentially yes
[23:08:19] <waleee> thanks
[23:09:44] <dije> I see in the example code how to obtain the page URL and the HTML>HEAD>TITLE tag value.
[23:10:23] <dije> Presumably there's a function for obtaining the user-highlighted selection too? That's all I'd need, I guess.
[23:11:38] <waleee> not sure, you might have to resort to js/parenscript inside the lisp
[23:19:42] <waleee> I haven't managed to unbork my build of nyxt yet, but this https://github.com/atlas-engineer/nyxt/blob/master/source/input-edit.lisp#L22 and some of the other things in that file might be useful as a reference for js/ps <-> lisp interaction for selections in nyxt
