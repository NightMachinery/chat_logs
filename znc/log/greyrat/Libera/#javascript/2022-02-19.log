[06:07:00] <quartz> Why is JQuery becoming legacy tech?
[06:07:15] <quartz> Yeah but why is JQuery becoming phased out?
[06:07:49] <ox1eef> because the browser caught up in standardizing and providing the functionality jquery use to provide.
[06:08:18] <quartz> ox1eef: What do you mean in layman's terms?
[06:08:42] <ox1eef> jquery solved the problems of the last decade, or longer ago - we have new problems now, and new APIs.

[06:36:59] <wroathe> I added a small helper that was something like: const createEl = (attrs = {}, children = [], el = 'div') => Object.keys(attrs).reduce(..., document.createElement(el));
[06:37:22] <wroathe> And yeah, if you need reactivity you've got options
[06:41:05] <ox1eef> vanilla JS works when put in careful hands, otherwise it can quickly become a mess
[06:41:38] <wroathe> ox1eef: In my experience this is true of all applications at scale regardless of framework or library
[06:42:05] <wroathe> React doesn't save you from writing unmaintainable nonsense on it's own
[06:42:17] <ox1eef> id agree, but react or vue or whatever it may be usually provide conventions and structure to avoid some of the pitfalls.

[07:27:58] <matsaman> it would be a little amusing, to do it without jQuery, and see if your instructor even had any idea it wasn't using jQuery
[07:28:09] <matsaman> or, if they were cool enough to notice but not care
[07:28:11] <KevinX> well, with programming in general that's common. Then when you finally solve something you get that endorphin rush and serotonin release that makes it all worth it
[07:28:14] <matsaman> but not without risk

[07:56:57] <KevinX> it just seems like we're almost done with it is all
[07:57:08] <KevinX> atually i got the second shot more than 5 months ago I guess
[07:57:36] <Rockwood_> KevinX, i am unable to get your point
[07:57:55] <KevinX> im talking about covid boosters lol
[07:58:08] <Rockwood_> i am confuse :D
[07:58:26] <KevinX> ill have to check when i got the last shot is all
[07:58:30] <KevinX> Time flies
[07:58:39] <Rockwood_> i never vaccinated
[07:58:42] <KevinX> Im just wondering if i still need it, or is covid basically over
[07:58:52] <systemfault> KevinX: It's going to eventually become like "flu 2"... people at risk at going to get their boosters when there are waves, and get antivirals (like paxlovid) when they catch it...
[07:59:12] <Rockwood_> covid is nothing now
[07:59:17] <KevinX> so i should get it then anyway, and again every year or whenever
[07:59:20] <Rockwood_> its weak
[07:59:34] <ox1eef> we've largely decided on herd immunity
[07:59:45] <KevinX> Rockwood_ I think that might be too soon to say 100%, but mostly its probably right
[07:59:55] <systemfault> ox1eef: There was nothing to decide, really.
[08:00:04] <KevinX> People still get it and die, and getting it and not dying means you're probably contributing to the spread
[08:00:14] <ox1eef> herd immunity was thought of as insane at the start.
[08:00:16] <systemfault> Anyone that requires everyone to comply to work is inevitably going to fail...
[08:00:18] <Rockwood_> i think infection does max already
[08:00:21] <systemfault> *anything
[08:00:39] <KevinX> and sometimes viruses get worse, so it's a misconception hat it will always get weaker
[08:00:41] <Rockwood_> so now stronger are remain on earth
[08:00:45] <systemfault> And lol even if we got 100% vaccinated, we would still have been f'ed by omicron
[08:01:18] <Rockwood_> again just forget that word now "covid"
[08:01:23] <KevinX> maybe. hard to say I guess. Maybe that mutation wouldn't have happened
[08:01:46] <ox1eef> omnicron is what will put covid into the memories of yesterday. it is mild, and highly contagious. it will be dominant, and not much to worry about.
[08:01:51] <systemfault> KevinX: It seems to be the trend though... virus tend to become more infectious but less pathogenic
[08:02:06] <Rockwood_> lol we are on off topic today :D
[08:02:20] <systemfault> Happens... it's the weekend

[08:03:28] <KevinX> Rockwood_ how many times did you give it?
[08:03:37] <xisop> i never tested positive for it, but about 2 weeks before they started shutting down the western US borders i got SUPER sick for a week
[08:03:44] <Rockwood_> i think more then 5 to 6 times
[08:03:58] <xisop> i have a feeling i got it back then. i havent had anything close to it since
[08:04:10] <Rockwood_> but i never tested it
[08:04:13] <ox1eef> so many people think they got it, but never know for sure, me included.
[08:04:17] <Rockwood_> just once fever i got
[08:04:19] <KevinX> I think covid mutates every 3 million transmissions or something
[08:04:20] <Rockwood_> for one day
[08:04:37] <KevinX> probably less than 3m
[08:04:46] <systemfault> KevinX: The weird part is omicron though...
[08:05:03] <KevinX> thats what most people arent thinking about. Whether it affects you personally doesnt really matter
[08:05:20] <KevinX> spreading it and it mutating is the only concern for healthy people
[08:05:24] <systemfault> KevinX: It's not a derivative of Delta... it's its own strain, directly from the original one
[08:05:36] <KevinX> I think there's a hybrid now too
[08:05:49] <KevinX> delta + omricon hybrid
[08:06:02] <systemfault> I've heard of that once... and it was due to bad lab contamination..
[08:06:20] <KevinX> I thought that was separate
[08:06:29] <Rockwood_> get request --> await fetch('https://api.rockwood.test/sanctum/csrf-cookie'); and  POST https://api.rockwood.test/api/auth/login 419
[08:06:30] <KevinX> oh no, youre right
[08:06:37] <KevinX> im thinking of omicron 2.0
[08:06:48] <systemfault> Ah, omicron 2 is real
[08:06:55] <Rockwood_> now deltacron is coming :D
[08:07:07] <KevinX> Rockwood_ I think it's like I said above, fetch isnt going to set that cookie on its own like axios does
[08:07:10] <systemfault> But it doesn't seem to be really different in terms of "effect", just more contagious
[08:07:32] <KevinX> its probably too late now to do anything
[08:07:48] <systemfault> I wonder if the origin of omicron is really the crap I've read...
[08:07:52] <KevinX> i don't want covid or the flu though just because i dont want to be sick lol

[08:15:16] <systemfault> I expected that only from stupid news outlets like Faux News.

[08:19:08] <KevinX> Thats between Feb 3, 2020 – Sep 10, 2020
[08:19:25] <matsaman> republican, "conservative" in some other country, same deal
[08:19:40] <matsaman> republicans in the USA like to call themselves 'conservatives' for some reason
[08:19:43] <bobdobbs> I've been watching the parliamentary, msm, antifa and antivaxx and fascist broadcasts and commentary about the vaccine mandate protests in wellington. They are all nuts. They are all absolutely paranoid.
[08:19:50] <KevinX> it is wild that every country has their version of the same thing
[08:20:00] <ox1eef> i'm not that either, stop trying to dump me into a group so you can align your stereotypes against me.
[08:20:04] <Rockwood_> is biden doing correct job?
[08:20:08] <matsaman> youd did it to yourself
[08:20:13] <matsaman> Rockwood_: compared to what
[08:20:19] <Rockwood_> Tump
[08:20:23] <matsaman> Trump? Hell yes. It's a low bar, though, for sure
[08:20:25] <Rockwood_> Trump
[08:20:27] <Rockwood_> yes
[08:20:28] <systemfault> Rockwood_: So far, nobody is happy... a lot of people are just happy that he's not Trump
[08:20:45] <ox1eef> okay, good luck - i won't be talking to you anymore. your attitude from the start was hostile, so sit on your high horse - for one day you will surely fall off it.
[08:20:47] <Rockwood_> you means both having similar
[08:20:55] <matsaman> you also have to keep in mind that there are a lot more people aligned with Biden's party than Trump's in the USA
[08:20:59] <systemfault> The idiot is probably going to start a war... because the US wouldn't be the US without useless wars.

[08:21:15] <matsaman> only that we elect people not by popular vote do republicans ever get elected
[08:21:22] <matsaman> that and voter turnout
[08:21:27] <matsaman> nah, Trump is done
[08:21:37] <matsaman> the only people who respected him that mattered thought he had balls
[08:21:40] <matsaman> but he's caved so many times
[08:22:03] <matsaman> his last chance was Jan 6
[08:22:08] <matsaman> you don't cave that hard and come back
[08:22:30] <matsaman> nobody useful in the military would support him anyway. He was always incredibly disrespectful to the military
[08:22:34] <systemfault> I thought that the media was harsh to Trump... but damn the guy was good at giving them ammunition by doing stupid shit
[08:22:40] <KevinX> he's making some good money post presidency though
[08:22:50] <matsaman> they weren't harsh enough, but really they should've just given him less coverage
[08:22:56] <KevinX> systemfault that was his strategy
[08:23:03] <Rockwood_> Trump performed less in these kind of activities
[08:23:12] <matsaman> somehow everyone given millions of dollars by their parents makes good money +p
[08:24:11] <ox1eef> the issue isn't trump but everyone person who takes part in the us political system, every thing ive seen indicates it is a toxic pit beyond rescue, and online discussions are partciuarly damning to this fact. in truth, the internet backfired on the us by dumping so much misinformation, disinformation and bad actors into its politics.
[08:24:47] <matsaman> ox1eef: this is also something republicans in the USA say, a lot
[08:24:59] <matsaman> "oh boo hoo every play is rigged .. guess I'll vote republican!"
[08:25:02] <matsaman> dumbest shit ever
[08:25:11] <matsaman> everything is rigged so here I go voting for a thing
[08:25:12] <Rockwood_> only the way for is axios
[08:25:26] <Rockwood_> fetch is not helpful
[08:25:30] <matsaman> Rockwood_: axios is immune to being bad newsmedia?
[08:25:33] <ox1eef> i'm not saying that either, but you are a prime example of what im talking about - you call me someting im not, then stereotype me, and then proceed with hostle discussion
[08:25:43] <matsaman> ox1eef: this is also what republicans say =P
[08:25:45] <ox1eef> thats us politics in a nutshell
[08:26:10] <matsaman> well, mind your own business and maybe people won't mistake you for a nutter in a country you aren't of
[08:26:13] <systemfault> Rockwood_: Then use Axios... why fight with fetch if Axios just works?
[08:26:24] <matsaman> axios, heh
[08:26:44] <ox1eef> matsaman: how about you just be respectful and stop being hostile, which youve been from the start - in plain language, you're an asshoe.
[08:26:52] <matsaman> oh lord
[08:26:56] <matsaman> there is zero change you are not a republican
[08:26:59] <matsaman> chance*
[08:27:03] <ox1eef> im not even american
[08:27:06] <matsaman> oh the liberals are picking on me
[08:27:12] <matsaman> well come to america and you'll be a republican
[08:27:30] <matsaman> I don't care if you're a conservative in another country, you're exactly the same
[08:27:35] <ox1eef> you have to put everyone in one of two groups, then decide you hate them

[08:28:00] <systemfault> ox1eef: There are two parties in the US... that's the game, unfortunately.
[08:28:04] <matsaman> now I can prioritize my time to not take you seriously
[08:28:07] <matsaman> Rockwood_: good advise
[08:28:12] <matsaman> systemfault: no, there are more
[08:28:21] <systemfault> matsaman: Two that matters.
[08:28:22] <matsaman> although all republicans think there are only two
[08:28:25] <matsaman> systemfault: no, there are more
[08:28:34] <matsaman> the idea that there are only two is really poisonous
[08:28:39] <matsaman> for everyone
[08:28:39] <systemfault> matsaman: Don't stop believing! Like the song says.
[08:28:40] <ox1eef> systemfault: i'm not even in the us. i don't have any partciuption in the things he so hates and annoy him.
[08:28:45] <matsaman> systemfault: it's reality
[08:28:47] <KevinX> ox1eef not trying to attack you or anything, but you are kind of following the same script we see almost daily on the right
[08:28:57] <KevinX> "the internet backfired on the us by dumping so much misinformation" I agree with this though
[08:29:03] <matsaman> ox1eef: I would dislike republicans who moved out of the USA just as much
[08:29:28] <ox1eef> KevinX: dude i'm not part of your society, i don't support trump or biden, i don't participate in your society - im totally disconnected from what you claim.
[08:29:37] <systemfault> matsaman: Republicans are not all crazies like MTG or stupid religious crazies.
[08:29:48] <KevinX> humans are the same all around

[08:29:59] <ox1eef> go to japan and tell me that
[08:30:09] <ox1eef> its not true, and its very small minded to think that way
[08:30:21] <KevinX> i used to live in japan, they have politics there too
[08:30:22] <matsaman> maybe you don't _realize_ it, ox1eef
[08:30:31] <matsaman> but you clearly support the ideas of republicans in the USA
[08:30:34] <matsaman> that's what I'm telling you

[08:30:39] <ox1eef> no i don't.

[08:30:52] <matsaman> thing*
[08:30:58] <systemfault> Most americans keep voting for the same stupid party no matter what happens
[08:31:27] <ox1eef> i support neither republican or democrat, i care little to nothing about us politics. i just observe, and i see how toxic it is. there is no respectful debate, there is just fighting and name calling, and worse. it is a disaster.
[08:31:42] <KevinX> its not even about politics
[08:31:45] <matsaman> systemfault: well, too many for sure
[08:31:48] <KevinX> its about ideas
[08:31:56] <matsaman> ox1eef: observe more quietly and I'll believe you
[08:32:10] <matsaman> until then I say you're supporting republicans
[08:32:26] <KevinX> ox1eef i think a lot of it might also be what media you consume
[08:32:28] <ox1eef> whatever, you're just an ass, and you'd be an ass if you were republican or democrat. you engage in hostile conversation and other antics.
[08:32:31] <systemfault> matsaman: Are you american? Because you seem to love labeling people...
[08:32:45] <matsaman> systemfault: as opposed to who?
[08:32:47] <KevinX> It doesnt look like a disaster to me. it's more of a joke
[08:32:52] <systemfault> matsaman: The rest of the world..
[08:33:08] <matsaman> systemfault: that's quite a comparison
[08:33:12] <KevinX> Right wing media plays on fear, left wing plays on hope (both are bad)
[08:33:32] <KevinX> but people who consume right wing media live in fear
[08:33:38] <ox1eef> KevinX: i don't read ring wing media at all. i actually read what most would call liberal media.
[08:33:42] <xisop> has anyone found a use for async local storage?

[08:35:04] <KevinX> isnt localStorage only synchronous?
[08:35:12] <systemfault> xisop: Looks like some primitives on which you would build profiling/monitoring tools
[08:35:14] <xisop> KevinX: this is different
[08:35:24] <xisop> systemfault: i see
[08:35:25] <matsaman> didn't remember Rogen in that
[08:35:48] <KevinX> xisop thats a node api
[08:35:54] <ox1eef> KevinX: i think the fault here is rejecting what i say before i say it, by putting me into one of two groups. its like, oh you disagree with me? then youre republican and suck. it works off steoreotypes, a feature of racism. it really made me realize every thing i think about the us political environment is true. it is a rancid pit.
[08:35:55] <xisop> yes
[08:36:17] <systemfault> yes

[08:49:45] <codebam> I'm just not sure why the request that is passed to handle() doesn't contain content anymore
[08:49:54] <codebam> compared to the previous commit
[08:50:18] <xisop> you probably want return this.processRequest
[08:50:24] <xisop> ah crap
[08:50:37] <codebam> yeah I did that
[08:50:48] <xisop> nah, sorry, i hit enter too fast
[08:50:52] <codebam> all good
[08:51:57] <KevinX> whats in request when you pass it in?
[08:52:23] <xisop> okay, so here's what i see... it looks like this.bot.update() is asynchronous because initially you were putting an await in front of the call.. .is that so?
[08:52:35] <KevinX> Shouldn't u be using `response`?
[08:53:14] <codebam> no request because I'm checking the content of what the webhook sends me, not the response of how I handle it
[08:54:06] <KevinX> oh ok
[08:54:09] <KevinX> you're mutating it
[08:55:11] <codebam> yeah I know I need to fix that
[08:55:16] <KevinX> its late here so im probably not following :P
[08:55:18] <xisop> codebam: by doing return this.bot.update(..) you are returning a promise and not the result of the promise
[08:55:44] <KevinX> this line? if (req.cf) req.content = await this.getContent(req);
[08:55:52] <xisop> codebam: so, initially, the deleted code had that part right by awaiting it
[08:57:01] <codebam> xisop: isn't fetch awaiting that for me?
[08:57:12] <codebam> because it gets returned directly to the fetch
[08:58:03] <xisop> return this.processRequest is returning a promise
[08:59:27] <xisop> on line 32 of the deleted code, this.request will have the response before it moves on to instantiating the TelegramBot
[08:59:43] <codebam> is it because I'm trying to mutate request and then use it in the then?
[08:59:49] <codebam> or wait
[09:00:03] <codebam> maybe I should be using response
[09:00:07] <KevinX> i think ti's from the function i mentioned above
[09:00:51] <xisop> if you do console.log(this.processRequest(request)); it will print "Promise<Pending>" or something like that

[12:10:38] <copier_> say you need to construct and add some nodes in the dom

[12:12:17] <systemfault> There's a reason why people have moved to more declarative frameworks...
[12:12:46] <Maxdamantus> copier_: I'd generally use React, but if not using a framework for whatever reason, you can always just create an object that provides the abstraction you want, so it has a few methods on it that will do all the DOM manipulations for you.
[12:12:57] *** Quits: chao (~stenno@user/stenno) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[12:13:53] <Maxdamantus> A library will normally work that way, since a library will often involve creating something in the DOM, but the library users are only meant to interact with it through a particular API.

[12:15:38] <codebam> it's a reducer
[12:15:46] <EdFletcher> I love building single-file no dependency stuff and I always just use vanilla JS.

[12:16:26] <Maxdamantus> copier_: sure, it's fine to not use a framework. You can create abstractions without a framework.

[19:32:38] <KevinX> you can write () => console.log() || doStuff() as the former returns undefined and will call the latter
[19:34:56] <KevinX> codebam looks like you still didn't update this part of the code https://github.com/codebam/moonitor/blob/broken-code/src/handler.ts#L75
[19:35:00] <stagas> you can also write an entire program using just the && and || operators and 0 and 1
[19:35:06] <KevinX> but you're logging around there at least
[19:35:10] <stagas> or just 1
[19:35:19] <stagas> && || and 1 should be enough for coding

[19:38:39] <stagas> console.log('foo') || doStuff() means "if console log fails do stuff" -- wait a minute why would console log fail, oh it returns undefined, which is falsy.. and your mind has to decompile it, which is a waste
[19:38:57] <KevinX> like i said though, it's for temporarily logging

[19:41:24] <KevinX> but it's useful especially in react components when debugging and you want to quickly log without removing your fancy arrow function
[19:41:27] <KevinX> const foo = (bar) => console.log(bar) || <></>

[19:45:42] <stagas> and that reads properly: "if debug console.log"

[20:54:59] <KevinX> Seemed dead last time I checked though
[20:55:13] <codebam> is fetch(...).then(response => response.json()).then() equivalent to fetch(...).then(response => response.json().then(...)) or no?
[20:55:37] <SpiceMan> no
[20:55:38] <codebam> if they aren't equivalent, should I use the second one?
[20:56:22] <codebam> I thought the .then() would await the next promise too so the first one would do the same thing
[20:56:24] <blueagain> KevinX: I was a dalnet user too.
[20:56:51] <blueagain> It was hit by a DDOS at some point and they basically shut off access to an entire country, don't remember which was it was. was really bad.
[20:56:59] <han-solo> the first then returns a promise which is `response.json()`

[23:45:12] <Maxdamantus> fweht: afaik pretty much everyone uses upper-case class names, whether it's a React component or not.
[23:45:24] <fweht> Maxdamantus: cool, thanks a lot!
[23:46:00] <Maxdamantus> and even functional React components use upper-case names.
[23:48:02] <Maxdamantus> https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html
[23:48:05] <Maxdamantus> > Note: Always start component names with a capital letter.
[23:48:47] <Maxdamantus> Yeah, so actually you're forced to use upper-case names by the JSX syntax, unless you write something like `<{foo} a="b">...</{foo}>`
[23:51:04] <Maxdamantus> The convention of upper-case class names came well before React; all of the standard JS "classes" use upper-case names, eg, `Object`, `Function`, `String`, `Array`, `RegExp`

[23:57:25] <Maxdamantus> and to the extent that Go has classes, Go doesn't either (it uses upper/lower to distinguish visibility)
