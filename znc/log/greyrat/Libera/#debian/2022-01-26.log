[06:32:10] <jmcnaught> GNOME has VNC screen sharing built in, you can turn it on from inside Settings.  You do this on the system whose screen you want to view/control remotely with a VNC client on a different computer.
[06:32:43] <Wade> that is probably why none of the tuts worked, thank you jmcnaught

[06:37:57] <zumba_addict> Hi all. We generate deb packages and we host it internally in our artifactory server running in an EC2 instance. We have so much pain with Artifactory like sometime it's not reindexed and other issues. We'd like to use another repository that we can also install to another EC2 instance. What would you recommend?
[06:37:58] <jmcnaught> I have never used realvnc.  I think vinagre because it gets installed with GNOME.
[06:38:26] <jmcnaught> Wade: what are you using VNC for?
[06:38:47] <Wade> to run terminal to interact with systemd for game servers

[06:43:17] <Wade> is just what i used for the pi and it worked ok

[07:15:02] <wade__> seems too vague
[07:15:02] <sney> I haven't used vnc in a long time, but I kind of remember some clients using a double colon, maybe? host::port?
[07:15:28] <wade__> https://archive.realvnc.com/products/vnc/documentation/4.2/win/winvncviewer.pdf
[07:16:11] <wade__> i put the port in at the end of vnc://debian.local the same way as demonstrated in the documentation to no avail
[07:16:25] <sney> yeah, look at that. page 20, "Enter the address (IP address or url) of the remote server system, immediately followed by two colons and then the port number"
[07:16:27] <wade__> is the only way i know how to add ports :/

[07:18:30] <wade__> at least in the first image on page 20, not so much in the 2nd it is badly garbled

[07:20:18] <sney> that's a separate example, obviously in a web browser.
[07:20:20] <wade__> and two colons in the first image 192.168.0.3::5200

[07:32:47] <sney> do you have a firewall configured on the debian host? that could do this
[07:32:56] <wade__> no was 1st thing i checked
[07:33:29] <wade__> it's a bone stock debian 11.2 amd64 with nvidia nouveau, x99 128GB ram
[07:33:51] <wade__> with gnome selected during the installation
[07:34:02] <sney> yeah, debian does not ship with any firewall enabled, but some 3rd party stuff will turn it on
[07:34:18] <wade__> i've only installed hexchat and turned on the screen sharing stuff in gnome
[07:34:29] <wade__> and added myself to sudoers list
[07:34:40] <sney> maybe turn off the gnome screen sharing thing, log into gnome in xorg mode, and try it with x11vnc instead?
[07:34:58] <wade__> don't know what the latter two things are
[07:35:12] <wade__> i can probably google xllvnc though
[07:35:31] <sney> gnome in debian uses wayland by default. xorg is an option in the logon screen to use a different gui rendering system
[07:35:53] <wade__> yes i like it was hoping to not have a deviation on the vnc
[07:35:53] <sney> x11vnc (those are the number 1) is a package you can install to share your desktop over vnc
[07:36:26] <sney> it's very old but it's still available and should work ok
[07:36:44] <sney> ,i x11vnc
[07:36:45] <wade__> x11 is how i do it in wsl i think
[07:36:46] <judd> Package x11vnc (x11, optional) in bullseye/amd64: VNC server to allow remote access to an existing X session. Version: 0.9.16-7; Size: 993.0k; Installed: 2114k; Homepage: http://www.karlrunge.com/x11vnc/
[07:37:18] <sney> X11 is basically another name for xorg. x11vnc is a specific piece of software you can install in debian with apt.
[07:37:52] <wade__> i feel like if i add another vnc it's going to be some other x number than is mentioned in the tuts thereby giving me the errors i got before i went to irc for assistance
[07:38:21] <wade__> because even though i didn't have the gnome screen sharing turned on it still failed miserably with tightvnc and tigervnc
[07:38:36] <sney> there will be no visual difference between gnome in wayland and gnome in xorg. wayland is a newer technology, but at present, it is just trying to show the same gui as xorg.
[07:38:54] <sney> x11vnc is the established (for 10+ years) way of sharing an existing linux desktop over vnc.
[07:39:14] <sney> I hoped the gnome thing would work, maybe there's a way, but I've never used it
[07:39:33] <wade__> yeah is too bad jmcnaught went afk or something
[07:39:55] <wade__> all my 12TB disks are coming tomorrow was hoping to get this chooching before then
[07:40:14] <wade__> my old synology from 2013 is elderly and full
[07:40:31] <wade__> and can't transcode anything
[07:40:57] <sney> are you saying you already tried x11vnc, or ..?
[07:41:06] <wade__> no
[07:41:25] <sney> do you need more instructions?
[07:43:04] <wade__> no following tut from 2015
[07:43:24] <sney> ok, I'm done here, good luck

[12:09:25] <FreeBDSM_> hi. I have a problem installing fresh git. https://git-scm.com/download/linux suggests to `sudo add-apt-repository ppa:git-core/ppa && sudo apt update && sudo apt install git`, however this results into a `warning: apt-key is deprecated. Manage keyring files in trusted files in trusted.gpg.d instead (see apt-key(8)).` + `sudo apt update` results into `W: GPG error: 'http://ppa.launchpad.net/git-core/ppa/ubuntu jammy InRelease: The following signatures

[15:07:38] <eoli3n> Hi
[15:07:51] <eoli3n> is there a way with preseed to install a package on the installer OS
[15:08:04] <eoli3n> i'm trying to get sshd working, i can install the package in early_command
[15:08:21] <eoli3n> but it fails because debconf locked dbdriver file

[15:10:37] <PerfDave> eoli3n: What are you trying to do? SSH into an installer to complete the installation?
[15:10:50] <eoli3n> i want to be able to access the host during installation
[15:11:00] <eoli3n> i boot pxe on a nfsroot installer os
[15:11:38] <PerfDave> That's documented in the install guide isn't it?

[15:14:21] <eoli3n> is ubuntu preseed the same as debian preseed ?
[15:15:36] <Cool_Fire> For debian < 20.04 it is, I'm not sure if the same preseeds still work since 20.04 since they changed the installer

[15:16:59] <eoli3n> thanks
[15:17:03] <PerfDave> eoli3n: Then you probably want to ask #ubuntu not #debian, if you're using Ubuntu not Debian.
[15:18:16] <Cool_Fire> I'm interested in the answer though if you find out eoli3n. As it happens I need to build some autoinstall for an ubuntu 20.04 setup

[22:14:27] <libh> I like debian, and it would be a shame to see snaps replace traditional deb packages. Hopefully a good resolution is found.
[22:15:13] <sney> even if some container-based solution ends up being the direction for chromium, it certainly wouldn't replace the whole package infrastructure
[22:15:41] <sney> finding a solution for 1 thing that needs to be better is not a slippery slope. and debian historically takes for-bloody-ever with anything big.
[22:16:48] <karlpinc> While we're talking browsers, every so often there (seems to be) a firefox-esr upgrade (or maybe firefox is upgrading itself?  I don't always recall upgrading the debian packages.) and my extensions are all lost and I have to re-install them.  Is this expected?

[22:20:44] <karlpinc> Khepra: That's likely the explanation.

[22:21:22] <libh> Will debian stop splitting the low latency kernel next release (debian 12) because a few versions ago, you could compile to where you set a boot flag to if it's preemptive or not.
[22:22:42] <Khepra> karlpinc: in general, after the webextensions mechanism has replaced xul, that should not happen.

[22:45:23] <jelly> my recipe is roughly: step 1) "vncpasswd ~/.vnc/passwd", on the server; step 2) ssh -L5900:localhost:5900 from remote to the server step 3) x11vnc -display :0 -rfbauth ~/.vnc/passwd -auth guess -localhost
[22:45:59] <jelly> step 3 is run on the server, either within that same ssh session or some other way
[22:46:15] <jelly> step 1) needs only be done once
[22:47:24] <jelly> oh, and step 4) run vnc client on local machine, and point it to vnc server ":0" or localhost:0 ; the ssh tunnel will take care to securely route vnc traffic to the server

[23:29:37] <jelly> !point release
[23:29:38] <dpkg> Point releases are updates to <stable> and <oldstable>, fixing security & grave bugs. If you track security updates regularly (as you should!) there will often be no updates for you in a point release. Upgrade by referencing a Debian <mirror> in /etc/apt/sources.list, then "apt update && apt full-upgrade". See <9.13> <10.10> (None for bullseye yet). https://wiki.debian.org/DebianReleases/PointReleases.

[23:30:50] <jelly> ^ regardless of outdated NUMBERS, sometimes point releases introduce changed dependencies for packages.  full-upgrade takes care of those.
