[15:17:19] <MaxFrames> hello. I have an openvpn server (community edition) running on debian. when I connect to a particular device (netgear switch) on the remote lan, via http, connection is refused, whereas I was able to connect to any other device I tried in the same lan
[15:18:06] <MaxFrames> this only happens when I connect to this switch via the vpn. every other device in the lan can connect to it (there are no ip restrictions on the device for the http connection)
[15:19:54] <MaxFrames> the vpn clients get a private IP from the vpn server and then gets on the LAN with the LAN-facing IP address of the vpn server (TUN, NAT)
[15:21:09] <MaxFrames> it's either the switch refusing connections from this IP (but as I said the device does not even HAVE an ACL/firewall feature) or, more likely, something strange is happening with the NAT.... can you help?
[15:28:36] <Snegodick> switch without default route
[15:28:41] <Snegodick> check default route on switch
[15:31:27] <MaxFrames> default gateway you mean?
[15:35:12] <Snegodick> yes
[15:35:51] <MaxFrames> that is set and correct, and in all cases, all the involved devices are on the same lan/bc domain so the gateway is not a factor
[15:35:57] *** Quits: lorimer (~lorimer@user/lorimer) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[15:52:58] <Snegodick> MaxFrames, vpn server and default router - the same device?
[15:53:13] <MaxFrames> no
[15:53:48] <Snegodick> add route to vpn network in switch route table
[15:54:42] <Snegodick> or make NAT from vpn server, if vpn server have an IP address in same network which have switch
[15:54:57] <ordex> he does that already - as stated
[15:55:05] <ordex> MaxFrames: is the connection refused or does it timeout?
[15:55:50] <Snegodick> need traceroute
[15:56:00] <MaxFrames> I saw an "err_connection_refused" on firefox, it seems to just timeout on other browsers, I dunno if the device actively refused or not
[15:56:19] <MaxFrames> important fact: I *can* ping the device from the vpn. just not connect via http
[15:56:41] <ordex> MaxFrames: no log on he device? it may tell you why the connection to the webserver is being botched
[15:56:45] <Snegodick> may be switch have a ACL for admin interface
[15:57:26] <ordex> MaxFrames: can you connect to the switch from the VPN server directly ?
[15:57:33] <MaxFrames> no logs, it's a very basic switch
[15:57:46] <ordex> you use the same IP (since you do NAT) so connecting from there will eliminate part of the variables
[15:57:50] <MaxFrames> ordex: good question, let me try with wget
[15:57:58] <ordex> yap wget or curl
[15:59:51] <MaxFrames> bingo, wget times out from the vpn server itself
[16:00:40] <MaxFrames> nope! sorry, I typed https but it's http. no, it works.
[16:00:50] <Snegodick> blah
[16:01:42] <MaxFrames> so the ip address of the vpn server is not the problem
[16:02:00] <MaxFrames> the switch as I said does not have ACL features
[16:02:20] <MaxFrames> traceroute is a three hop path to the device, no timeouts
[16:02:39] <MaxFrames> ping gets through...
[16:03:25] <Snegodick> Your problem is probably firewall. Really
[16:04:50] <MaxFrames> firewall? in a lan?
[16:05:40] <MaxFrames> there is no firewall on the target device... or acl...
[16:06:06] <MaxFrames> netgear GS108Ev3, it's a very basic 8 ports desktop mini switch
[16:06:57] <MaxFrames> I can connect from any host on the lan, including the openvpn server... just not from openvpn clients (which get on the LAN via NAT with the openvpn server IP address which we at this point know is not the problem)

[16:07:46] <Snegodick> it's not openvpn problem
[16:07:55] <Snegodick> check your firewall or routes
[16:08:55] <ordex> MaxFrames: just guessing: does the VPN work for other type of traffic (ping is not a good candidate)
[16:08:58] <ordex> maybe this is an mtu issue
[16:09:29] <ordex> MaxFrames: but can't rule out that the VPN server is not doing forwarding correctly - you could check on the VPN server is the request is properly going out on the LAN interface or not
[16:12:41] <MaxFrames> it works to connect to other http/https devices on the same lan
[16:12:57] <MaxFrames> I think you may be right about the mtu
[16:15:05] <ordex> just set something smaller on the vpn client
[16:15:07] <ordex> and test again
[16:15:18] <ordex> like tun-mtu 1400

[16:26:25] <MaxFrames> can't remember where to set mtu on the server.... it's not in /etc/openvpn/[server].conf
[16:28:41] <ordex> because it uses the default
[16:28:44] <ordex> you can add it there
[16:28:48] <ordex> and same on the client
[16:31:31] <MaxFrames> I tried 1400 on the client, no change... does it have to be set on the server also accordingly? or does the client value override?
[16:32:19] <ordex> client only should be enough, even though asymetric values may create other issues
[16:32:27] <ordex> but client should be enough for your test
[16:32:36] <ordex> as next step I'd really suggest to check with tcpdump on the server
[16:32:41] <ordex> to understand what's going on with the packets
[16:32:48] <MaxFrames> I got a warning indeed about asymmetric values (server is 1500)
