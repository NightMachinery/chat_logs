[00:27:52] <matsaman> twiclo: centered div?

[00:28:22] <twiclo> topnav-centered
[00:28:26] <matsaman> ah
[00:28:46] <matsaman> so like, 'Home' on the bottom, and the rest still at the top?
[00:29:56] <matsaman> the bottom of the list of nav items, or the viewport?
[00:29:58] <twiclo> Yeah
[00:30:26] <twiclo> I don't know what a viewport is but if you shrink the window enough it'll put the divs top to bottom instead of left to right
[00:30:33] <twiclo> I would want home to be at the bottom of those divs
[00:30:53] <FunkyBob> we need to teach the bot to warn people how shite w3schools is any time a link to it is pasted... :/
[00:31:06] <FunkyBob> (I know, it's just their paste bin this time)
[00:31:34] <matsaman> yeah, but
[00:31:43] <matsaman> then you start automating everything
[00:31:48] <matsaman> and spending time with your family instead
[00:31:50] <matsaman> rich and fat
[00:31:55] <matsaman> that's not normal
[00:31:57] <FunkyBob> a 'viewport' is the browser window showing the page
[00:32:20] <FunkyBob> consider, the page often extends past the visible area... what's showing is in the viewport

[00:32:47] <FunkyBob> so when the window is narrow, you want 'Home' to be at the bottom of the list of nav links?
[00:33:08] <FunkyBob> flexbox allows you to redefine ordering, doesn't it?
[00:33:22] <FunkyBob> oh... you're using flot :/
[00:33:25] <matsaman> yeah, this markup is pretty bad
[00:33:54] <FunkyBob> the markup isn't so bad [if a little DIVitis-y]
[00:34:13] <matsaman> you should have like <ul id="nav"><li><a href="#home">Home</a></li><li>...News...About</a></li></ul>
[00:34:26] <FunkyBob> there is a <nav> element now, too
[00:34:27] <matsaman> and it'd be really easy to do the "desktop" version and also simply reverse the order for the small screen version

[00:34:55] <matsaman> what does 'nav' get me that <ul id="nav"> doesn't already provide
[00:35:04] <matsaman> they should've done that 'nl' one
[00:35:45] <twiclo> You guys seem to know what you're talking about but it's all over my head haha
[00:35:49] <matsaman> it doesn't make sense to have <div><div>one link</div>two more links<div>one more link</div></div>. The hierarchy is all whack
[00:36:12] <matsaman> twiclo: so, it could be done with this markup (HTML), but it's really bad markup and I wouldn't bother

[00:58:04] <twiclo> Not sure what you mean oksushi
[00:58:36] <oksushi> I mean that when you’re moving elements out of order, you need to check that a keyboard user can tab through them in a logical order
[00:58:48] <oksushi> which is left to right, top to bottom

[01:23:19] <twiclo> That doesn't have the text input bar though
[01:25:41] <hassoon> twiclo: what is your issue, wasn't around earlier
[01:27:09] <FunkyBob> where does the text input go?
[01:27:17] <FunkyBob> since it wasn't in your initial design
[01:27:25] <FunkyBob> oh, you posted a pen link
[01:27:29] <twiclo> https://codepen.io/twiclo/pen/KKXROJN?editors=1100
[01:27:31] <twiclo> Yeah
[01:27:51] <FunkyBob> ok, and...
[01:27:51] <twiclo> Issue is I want that input bar centered and ALSO want it on the bottom when the screen is shrunk down
[01:27:58] <FunkyBob> ok
[01:28:07] <FunkyBob> it's not centered now because there's no right element any more
[01:28:19] <FunkyBob> ISTM you didn't understand how my design worked :/
[01:28:54] <twiclo> You'd be correct haha. I could come up with a button to go into that corner if that's easiest though
[01:28:57] <hassoon> twiclo: bottom of the header ? or of the page ?
[01:29:01] <twiclo> I don't know maybe a link to the repo
[01:29:20] <twiclo> Bottom of the header like what "Home" does in the design FunkyBob gave me
[01:29:24] <FunkyBob> mine worked by having left/centre/right elements, and making them evenly sized
[01:29:48] <twiclo> Okay then I'll just add a link to the repo. How else am I going to shill it?
[01:36:28] <hassoon> twiclo: like that ? https://ghanhass.github.io/myfiddle/18
[01:36:38] <hassoon> twiclo: i'd opt for absolute positioning in your case
[01:37:37] <hassoon> twiclo: also why the weird flex:1 style for header contents ?
[01:41:09] <twiclo> Looking
[01:41:33] <twiclo> Oh that's perfect
[01:42:15] <twiclo> I don't know why that flex is there. That wasn't even in the w3schools I example I started with
[01:43:46] <twiclo> You know what? You're going to hate me for this
[01:43:54] <twiclo> Do you think it'd look better to have the text input on the right?
[01:44:17] <twiclo> Heck I could even make that change
[01:44:20] <twiclo> One sec let's see
[01:44:23] <hassoon> twiclo: i'd put it on the left side next to the watch later
[01:44:34] <hassoon> to keep the header contents together
[01:44:58] <hassoon> twiclo: well yes the right side might look better imo
[01:45:11] <twiclo> The idea is that watch later is a playlist and every new playlist will be right next to it. You could have like 5 playlists and I like the idea of the bar being in the same place always for quick adding

[01:51:24] <FunkyBob> i feel twiclo did not ask enough questions to understand my solution
[01:51:31] <FunkyBob> hence including styles without reason :/
[01:51:50] <FunkyBob> there's little point coming here and asking for help if you're not going to make the effort to understand the solutions.
[01:52:44] <twiclo> https://codepen.io/FunkyBob/pen/zYEjgaP?editors=1100
[01:52:45] <twiclo> This one?
[01:53:03] <FunkyBob> well, when hassoon asks why the flex: 1 ; is there, and you can't answer why...
[01:53:21] <twiclo> I hardly understand what margin: auto does
[01:53:27] <FunkyBob> so ASK
[01:53:43] <twiclo> Oh okay I have heard of flexbox before
[01:53:49] <FunkyBob> this channel is here to educate... but that won't happen if you don't mention what you don't understand
[01:53:54] <twiclo> So does setting it to 1 enable flexbox?
[01:54:06] <FunkyBob> setting "display: flex;" enables flex layout
[01:54:23] <FunkyBob> then that containers immediate children can be flexed according to their flex values
[01:54:41] <twiclo> So 1 is the left most or top most?
[01:54:56] <FunkyBob> they start at their flex-basis size, then their flex-grow and flex-shrink settings desicde how the remaining space is allocated, proportionately
[01:55:03] <FunkyBob> 1 what?
[01:55:09] <twiclo> So you make all of topnav a flexbox. What does > * do?
[01:55:27] <twiclo> Do most people like flexbox?
[01:55:29] <FunkyBob> ">" is selector syntax for "immediate descendants"...i.e. the elements own children
[01:55:34] <FunkyBob> and * means "any element"
[01:55:49] *** Quits: dpuerto (~dpuerto@136-27-83-52.cab.webpass.net) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[01:55:51] <FunkyBob> so  ".topnav > *" selects all the children of elements with class "topnav"
[01:56:27] <FunkyBob> flexbox is a much nicer, safer, more powerful layout tool than what we had before
[01:56:28] <twiclo> So why set every immediate child to flex: 1. Sounds like the number value is a sort of state according to mdn
[01:56:38] <FunkyBob> not having to fuck about with float containment, for a start :P
[01:56:58] <FunkyBob> flex: 1;  is a shorthand for setting the 3 flex-* values
[01:57:52] <FunkyBob> so "flex: 1;" is short for "flex: 1 1 0", meaning it starts with a base size 0, and can grow and shrink
[01:58:22] <FunkyBob> the number is the proportionate weight of flex space to allocate
[01:58:36] <FunkyBob> if it were 2, it would get twice as much of the leftover space as any with a value of 1
[01:59:00] <FunkyBob> `flex @ twiclo
[01:59:01] <Selvvir> twiclo, Read all about flexbox: http://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/ & http://jonibologna.com/flexbox-cheatsheet/ - Game/tutorial: http://flexboxfroggy.com/
[02:00:08] <twiclo> So basically it tells the containers how aggressive to be when taking up space?
[02:00:24] <FunkyBob> that's a good way to put it, yeah
[02:01:00] <FunkyBob> the container will first start with each child at its 'basis' size... then take the leftover space and allocate it to each based on  their grow/shrink values
[02:01:29] <FunkyBob> also there's controls for if  the flex layout is veritcal (flex-direction: column;) or horizontal (row)
[02:01:33] <FunkyBob> and if it can wrap or not
[02:01:48] <FunkyBob> the css-tricks link is a good reference for all  the knobs you can tweak

[05:40:00] <entropy_> sorry
[05:40:11] <entropy_> i'm not understanding how it should be?
[05:40:27] <entropy_> like <ul><li>This</li></ul> ?
[05:41:29] <entropy_> how do i go about making it only one <ul>?

[05:45:05] <entropy_> any advice?
[05:46:02] <oksushi> yes — aim for a structure like this https://capture.dropbox.com/5Np0mBiQGebcQR7m?src=ss

[05:48:09] <entropy_> how's this: https://jsfiddle.net/j5oamx6w/5/
[05:48:55] <oksushi> much better

[05:49:14] <oksushi> do you know the <a> element?
[05:50:05] <entropy_> yes
[05:50:31] <entropy_> the reason i didn't use <a> was because i want the whole div to be clickable, not just the text
[05:50:35] <entropy_> any work around?
[05:51:07] <oksushi> yes — you can use CSS
[05:51:20] <entropy_> okay
[05:51:27] <entropy_> like padding?

[06:06:56] <FunkyBob> jsfiddle has handy Tidy buttons top-right of each  pane
[06:07:44] <entropy_> why

[06:10:48] <entropy_> https://jsfiddle.net/qj5wn7oz/4/

[06:11:40] <oksushi> also, remove all of those meaningless title attributes
[06:12:14] <entropy_> so: "about" becomes "About"?

[07:19:28] <entropy_> anothe quick question...
[07:19:32] <entropy_> another*
[07:19:48] <FunkyBob> mmm?
[07:19:54] <entropy_> how do i stretch the navbar to be 800px?
[07:20:01] <entropy_> but remain in the center
[07:20:20] <FunkyBob> so... instead of being full screen like it is now?
[07:21:44] <entropy_> no i mean the navbar is full screen, i want the "navbar divs" to stretch to 800px
[07:22:03] <entropy_> i know it's flex something
[07:22:13] <FunkyBob> have a look
[07:22:21] <FunkyBob> see what element is having the background set red
[07:23:22] <entropy_> i have this
[07:23:43] <entropy_> .navigation { display: flex; justify-content: center; margin: 0; padding: 0; text-transform: uppercase; background: red; }
[07:23:57] <entropy_> now what?
[07:24:10] <FunkyBob> ... so, that's the nav tabs
[07:24:21] <entropy_> no
[07:24:21] <FunkyBob> clearly it's already full width
[07:24:26] <entropy_> that's the 100% width red div
[07:24:27] <FunkyBob> yes, it really is
[07:24:29] <FunkyBob> yes
[07:24:36] <FunkyBob> it's the ul
[07:26:37] <entropy_> .navigation ul {} ?
[07:26:55] <FunkyBob> what about it?
[07:27:23] <FunkyBob> that's selecting any UL that is a descendant of an element with class 'navigation'

[07:58:10] <FunkyBob> for border width thre are some shorthands that would make this simpler
[07:58:19] <FunkyBob> border-width: 1px;  makes all sizes 1px
[07:58:28] <FunkyBob> border-width: 0 1px;  makes top/bottom 0, and left/right 1px

If it's local or private, copy your HTML and CSS into a `testcase in a `paste server like http://jsfiddle.net or http://codepen.io. Screenshots and plain text code pastes are difficult to debug.

[08:25:18] <entropy_> https://mypastebin.com/test/navbar3.php -> i want the navbar to stretch all divs to equal 800px, and when you make the window as small as possible, to be 100%

[08:25:33] <entropy_> i know it's with flex
[08:25:38] <entropy_> but i don't know how

[08:25:54] <entropy_> yes
[08:26:03] <entropy_> for all of them to equal 800px
[08:26:07] <entropy_> in total
[08:26:31] <FunkyBob> but when in 'mobile' view, they are each full window width?
[08:26:39] <entropy_> yes
[08:26:44] <entropy_> exactly
[08:27:38] <FunkyBob> in that case you'd need to set .navigation to be 800px wide, set the nav tabs to flex: 1;
[08:28:00] <FunkyBob> and add a media query for the smaller res... to set .navigation's flex-direction to column; and the elements  to flex:0;
[08:28:39] <FunkyBob> if you want that red to continue all across the top, you'll probably need to move it to #navbar

[14:03:54] <hendry> hi, this form's textarea used to take half the height of the screen, now it doesn't https://jsfiddle.net/kaihendry/dzq93eua/ ... what have I broken?
[14:06:50] <hendry> perhaps a better question, why isn't textarea height working? https://jsfiddle.net/kaihendry/dzq93eua/3/
[14:23:47] *** Joins: horseface (~horseface@user/horseface)
[14:26:28] <DPA> % is relative to the parent element, but that kind of needs to be knowable in advance to work. It's probably a bit more complicated than that, but if you make the form a known height, the textarea height will work with a percentage (for example, with "html,body,form { height:100%; }" or "form { height:200px; }", the textarea height of 50% will work).
[14:26:28] <DPA> But since you want half the screen height, you could use vh instead of %. vh is relative to the height of the viewport of the page. https://jsfiddle.net/x9o4tbL2/
[14:28:30] <stenno> generally i recommend working with flexbox and grid, then you usually don't have to worry about stuff like that

[17:35:06] <kevindank> this is particularly noticeable on smaller screens.

[22:57:52] <theskillwithin> bin scss is fair game
[22:58:19] <bin> ok so this is something im now runing into and didnt run into before: Error: compound selectors may no longer be extended.
[22:58:27] <bin> the thing is, i'm trying to extend ::before
[22:58:35] <bin> and it suggests doing .element, ::before
[22:58:41] <bin> but won't that extend EVERY ::before?
[22:58:50] <bin> or does it understand I mean .element::before
[23:01:12] <bin> some of the styles in  this case are ambiguous so i cant quite tell

[23:08:59] <bin> that is not a solution
[23:09:41] <stenno> new versions of sass have this breaking change
[23:10:00] <bin> i know but i do not have any control over the sass version
[23:10:26] <stenno> dunno if there is a sensible option then apart from actually redoing the entire damn thing
[23:10:34] <bin> i know i have to redo it
[23:10:55] <stenno> oh you are just venting, fair
[23:10:56] <bin> what im asking is i can't tell if .element, ::before is extending every before or if it is actually only extending .element::before
[23:11:04] <stenno> oh i see
[23:11:13] <stenno> should be every ::before, no?
[23:11:19] <bin> so i need to figure out if that is the solutiuon, or if i have to make mixins
[23:11:32] <bin> that's what i thought too, but that's their suggestion which is what's throwing me
[23:11:49] <bin> and in this particular use-case i cant tell in my attempt
[23:11:57] <bin> i may have to try others and see what happens
[23:12:04] <stenno> who is 'they' in this case?
[23:12:07] <bin> i guess mixins are the safest bet, but idk how mixins work with pseudoelements
[23:12:15] <bin> they being the scss error message
[23:12:36] <bin> Consider `@extend .element, ::before` instead.
[23:12:45] <stenno> right, that can't be true
[23:12:55] <bin> ok, i just needed a reality check here
[23:13:01] <bin> it didnt seem like it could be true to me
[23:13:08] <bin> but im not sas expert
[23:13:22] <bin> so idk, maybe it has some magical intelligence with pseudo-elements or something
[23:13:38] <bin> but im thinking the opposite... it cant tell that it's a pseudo-element and think it's just another normal selector
[23:14:06] <bin> sorry, ive been a bit all over with this issue so sometimes i get caught in my own head and don't communicate clearly lol
[23:14:51] <bin> what is throwing me off is this https://sass-lang.com/documentation/breaking-changes/extend-compound doesnt mention pseudoelements at all
[23:15:02] *** Joins: dpuerto (~dpuerto@136-27-83-52.cab.webpass.net)
[23:15:16] <stenno> you just cannot extend compound selectors anymore
[23:15:32] <stenno> as its saying in the docs, sass does not know what '.foo::before' means
[23:15:34] <bin> yeeah
[23:15:42] <bin> stupid
[23:16:08] <stenno> yeah its a design flaw in @extends... thats why they are deprecating it like that
[23:17:13] <bin> imo the design flaw is not allowing compound extends lol because now i have to figure out a hack with mixins and pseudoelements
[23:17:33] <bin> maybe something like this https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45952266/mixin-possible-for-pseudo-element
[23:18:00] <bin> doubt the client wants to pay for this though lol so ill just live with the errors until it's really broken.
[23:18:07] <bin> ty for confirming whjat i thought though stenno
[23:18:12] <bin> and thanks for tolerating my minor rant
[23:19:04] <stenno> lol no issue
[23:19:15] <stenno> we know each other for quite some time now
[23:19:21] <bin> yeah lol :D
[23:19:26] <stenno> :)
[23:19:35] <bin> hope you had nice holidays and a happy new year
