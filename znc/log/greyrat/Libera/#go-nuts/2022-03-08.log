[00:30:32] <Mathisen> and that is the part im asking about here. is it efficiency enough
[00:30:52] *** Joins: NCS_One (~NCS_One@bl11-90-133.dsl.telepac.pt)
[00:31:55] <Mathisen> it takes some time for the program to finnish when passing the 9 to the function

[00:32:50] <Mathisen> nope i just did it today
[00:32:57] <Mathisen> maybe more people doing this

[00:37:30] <Mathisen> hmmm so i need to rethink the hole thing then....
[00:37:53] <Mathisen> i thought using just 2 for loops would make it kinda efficent

[00:41:31] <b0nn> That conversion from string to int is costing you a lot
[00:41:46] <b0nn> and you don't need to do it
[00:41:57] <b0nn> because they are n and n-1
[00:42:19] <Mathisen> but how would i compair the numbers without doing that ? i need a way to check that the number to the right is always bigger

[00:46:22] <Mathisen> and that was a diffrent assignment
[00:46:32] <Mathisen> way easyer then this one

[00:51:54] <b0nn> buiklder is a slice of bytes )and an address) which is cheaper to frow than strings because string immutability and allocation costs
[00:52:16] <b0nn> essentially, each time you call string += string you are creating a new string

[00:54:46] <pyzozord> the function definition says it will return string type
[00:55:07] <pyzozord> it seems to me that it constructs a new string anyway, what am I missing?

[18:07:38] <fizzie> It's obviously _possible_, but if you're looking for a built-in way, don't think one exists. io/fs.WalkDir can walk any FS (including an embed.FS), and you could have a WalkDirFunc that just calls ReadFile and adds the result to a map.
[18:11:15] <fizzie> That said, isn't an embed.FS pretty much "a `map[string][]byte` or something" already, in all the ways that matter, except for the syntax? Instead of `data, ok := myMap["path"]` you do `data, err := myFS.ReadFile("path")`, but that's scarcely worth mentioning.

[18:54:35] <braxas> I checked it, it is somewhere in /tmp
[18:56:55] <bpalmer> ah, https://dave.cheney.net/2016/05/10/test-fixtures-in-go : "First, when you run go test, for each package in scope, the test binary will be executed with its working directory set to the source directory of the package under test. "

[18:58:47] <bpalmer> so you can rely on the relative paths, or absify the current path and apply whatever heuristics you want (e.g., if your module is example.com/pkg/bar  , just search for that in the current working directory to know how to relativize it)
[19:02:57] *** Joins: aog (~aog@user/aog)
[19:06:56] <chilversc> If I need to poll a context to check if its cancelled/timedout, is there any significant difference between checking ctx.Err() vs non-blocking select on ctx.Done()?
[19:07:25] <chilversc> alternatively, any form of DirWalk that accepts a context?
[19:08:53] <bpalmer> you could have your walking function check the context itself.
[19:09:34] <chilversc> that's what I was thinking, just wondering about overhead of the mutex if I'm checking on every file
[19:09:54] *** Joins: LordDoskias (~lorddoski@212.21.133.210)
[19:10:26] <LordDoskias> does this line: NS, CNAME, PTR []byte inside a definition of a type struct entail some specil meaning or it's shorthand of declaring those 3 fields as a byte slice?
[19:10:51] <bpalmer> ah. I suppose you could only check it if the DirEntry parameter is a directory
[19:11:04] <siXy> would you actually need to check that mutex every file? Checking every N files where N is like 500 or so might be enough
[19:11:24] <chilversc> siXy: that's what I was thinking
[19:11:33] <bpalmer> since *most* of the time, individual directories are pretty small and the speed up is stopping from handling the next directory inline
[19:11:35] <bpalmer> *in line
[19:11:51] <bpalmer> (There are some pathological cases with overstuffed directories, admittedly)
[19:11:54] <siXy> Also as you're probably aware, it's very possible for a slow FS (eg NFS) to block indefnitely and not be cancelable, so your calling routine would maybe need to handle that anyways
[19:12:08] <chilversc> but was curious about; ctx.Err() vs select { ctx.Done(): default: } construct?
[19:12:35] <chilversc> siXy: that's ok, this is guaranteed to be local as I'm actually looking through FS-Cache to find the age of the oldest file
[19:12:37] <bpalmer> the only thing that immediately comes to mind is ctx.Err() doesn't establish a synchronization point
[19:12:59] <chilversc> bpalmer: it uses a mutex from what I could see
[19:14:08] <bpalmer> if it happens to use a mutex, then you're paying mutex overhead anyway.
[19:14:38] <bpalmer> but you're right, in almost every real world case for this, some form of synchronization has to happen inside of Err()'s body.
[19:15:40] <chilversc> yeah, I was wondering if anyone had established a good pattern or heuristics for handling checking context within a loop
[19:16:53] <bpalmer> In a tight loop, I just check every N times; haven't seen a better approach.
[19:17:12] <bpalmer> guess there's no reason to think differently about it in the walking pattern.

[20:15:29] <CoolerX> fizzie: ok, ia there some other in-memory filesystem?
[20:15:58] <A_Dragon> you could implement io.fs and extend it to have rw capabilities

[20:18:44] <CoolerX> for an in-memory filesystem
[20:18:47] <A_Dragon> you want an in-memory writable FS?
[20:18:48] <A_Dragon> why?
[20:19:39] <CoolerX> A_Dragon: so I can use the same code that works with an on disk filesystem
[20:19:48] <fizzie> Not in the standard library, I think. Externally, there's "github.com/spf13/afero".MemMapFs -- the context here is that afero was a pre-"io/fs" filesystem abstraction, that's been since then (I believe) made compatible with "io/fs".FS.
[20:20:11] <CoolerX> ok
[20:20:13] <A_Dragon> CoolerX: I mean you could implement fs.FS
[20:20:18] <A_Dragon> quite trivially, in fact
[20:20:30] <A_Dragon> and then as I said, extend it to allow writes
