[03:32:17] <Steve-Dusty> is this allauth?
[03:32:31] <Steve-Dusty> `ACCOUNT_LOGOUT_REDIRECT_URL = 'home'` instead of `LOGOUT_REDIRECT_URL`
[03:33:52] <Steve-Dusty> `<p><a href="{% url 'account_logout' %}">Log Out</a></p>` this instead of just `logout`
[03:38:00] <PaulWay[w]> So the latter is in the template and the former is in the settings, yes?
[03:38:17] <PaulWay[w]> There's a piece missing - the URL named `account_logout` in urls.py
[03:38:39] <PaulWay[w]> I think it may default to ACCOUNT_LOGOUT_REDIRECT_URL - would have to check the docs.
[03:38:52] <Steve-Dusty> what??
[03:39:01] <Steve-Dusty> i need to add account_logout in urls.py?
[03:39:08] <Steve-Dusty> the tutorial didn't ask me and it works fine

[08:02:13] <FunkyBob> I don't know... i'm still trying to work out your needs
[08:02:39] <FunkyBob> we can talk about solutions once we've scoped out the problem

[08:03:08] <Steve-Dusty> I want to **SIGNUP** needs 4 inputs. 1. Email. 2. Username. 3. Password. 4. Password2.   **Login** needs 2 inputs. 1. Email. 2. Username. All I want is this
[08:03:33] <FunkyBob> don't you mean email + password /
[08:03:34] <FunkyBob> ?
[08:03:46] <FunkyBob> and is 'username' more of a 'display name' ?
[08:04:31] <Steve-Dusty> username is more of a display name
[08:05:21] <FunkyBob> ok, well, consider this then -- it's a post about customising auth so you can have users register/sign up, get email verification, and then set their password
[08:05:24] <FunkyBob> https://blog.tinbrain.net/blog/django-registration-redux.html
[08:05:39] <FunkyBob> you would need to tweak the model a little to add name
[08:06:53] <Steve-Dusty> why redux
[08:07:06] <FunkyBob> because as i ssay at the start of the guide, it's a revision of an older post
[08:07:07] <Steve-Dusty> nvm
[08:07:27] <Steve-Dusty> it uses regex and token
[08:07:41] <FunkyBob> regex?
[08:07:55] <Steve-Dusty> `r'accounts`
[08:08:01] <Steve-Dusty> from django 2
[08:08:13] <FunkyBob> r'' is a python thing
[08:08:14] <FunkyBob> raw string
[08:08:26] <FunkyBob> it's not a regex
[08:08:27] <Steve-Dusty> oh
[08:08:36] <Steve-Dusty> because all examples I saw with "r" use regex
[08:08:42] <FunkyBob> however, yes, it's likely carried over from the original being url()
[08:08:55] <FunkyBob> it is helpful to use raw strings when declaring regex patterns, that's why
[08:09:46] <FunkyBob> """Both string and bytes literals may optionally be prefixed with a letter 'r' or 'R'; such strings are called raw strings and treat backslashes as literal characters."""
[08:09:52] <FunkyBob> https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#string-and-bytes-literals
[08:11:50] <Steve-Dusty> I think I will try to follow that..
[08:12:01] <Steve-Dusty> but what's the token for?
[08:13:00] <FunkyBob> it's emailed to the user to verify the email address is real/correct/theirs
[08:17:48] <Steve-Dusty> This would be helpful for a dedicated production project but since I'm my main focus for this web app is to learn CBVs and establish a registration system similar to the already built-in auth system but a step more with email login I don't believe this article is suitable for this particular project

[08:32:02] <tm007> Read this one.
[08:32:14] <tm007> In one memorable situation, I was working with some colleagues to help scale a com‐ putationally heavy system. The underlying calculations were performed by a C library we were given. Our job was to collect the various inputs, pass them into the library,
[08:32:14] <tm007> and retrieve and store the results. The library itself was riddled with problems. Mem‐ ory leaks and horrendously inefficient API design were just two of the major causes of problems. We asked for many months for the source code for the library so we could fix these issues, but we were rebuffed.
[08:32:23] <tm007> Many years later, I caught up with the project sponsor, and asked why they hadn’t let us change the underlying library. It was at that point the sponsor finally admitted they’d lost the source code but were too embarrassed to tell us! Don’t let this happen to you.

[08:32:58] <tm007> 🤣

[08:34:35] <tm007> FunkyBob:
[08:35:14] <Steve-Dusty> FunkyBob according to your blog, AbstractUser uses default fields which makes username unique but not Email
[08:35:56] <Steve-Dusty> so if I want email unique but not username, (two ppl can be named Mrs. Brown) i'd use AbstractUserBase
[08:36:03] <FunkyBob> yes
[08:39:29] <FunkyBob> AbstractUser is the default Django auth model, but abstract so you can inherit from it

[12:01:02] <serafeim> hello my friends
[12:03:13] <schinckel> dre: I've been known to dynamically generate the form in `get_form_class` if there is a bunch of customisation I need to do. Sometimes that's simpler than passing an argument in and doing it in __init__.
[12:04:08] <schinckel> That's really useful where you need to use querysets that reference something available on the request (like the user).
[12:06:32] *** Joins: rje (~rje@50.54.137.153)
[12:06:57] <schinckel> dre: Stuff like https://dpaste.org/NCnk
[12:07:20] <schinckel> I missed a bunch of bits in there though ;)
[12:08:23] <dre> ye cheers.
[12:08:40] <dre> this all helps, I ended up finding the place in the django docs (I'm getting faster at looking at the django website now )
[12:08:57] <dre> schinckel, that's interesting.
[12:09:33] <dre> I'm wondering if you "dynamically change" the field of a form; would that be picked up in validation? ie: if you set a field to disabled, would form.save ignore it?
[12:09:49] <dre> does it do that normally or is disabled purely cosmetic?
[12:10:06] <schinckel> Hmm. Not sure about disabled, but you can remove fields dynamically.
[12:11:06] <schinckel> You _can_ write a field that just uses `initial` for its value though.
[12:11:20] <schinckel> Or just not have the field in the form, and render it as a disabled input manually.
[12:11:36] <dre> for us we have some data available in the view; don't really want to pass it down to the form, but if we could just "set field disabled" when making the form, and then "ignore field result" on the save, that might be best.
[12:12:55] <schinckel> https://github.com/django/django/blob/main/django/forms/fields.py#L154 and https://github.com/django/django/blob/main/django/forms/fields.py#L175 both look like they are helping handle disabled "correctly" though.
[12:14:34] <schinckel> Because https://github.com/django/django/blob/main/django/forms/models.py#L30-L66 uses cleaned_data, which should have come from the bound_data, IIRC.
[12:16:46] <dre> i love how django just takes my worst assumptions and then gently caresses me and looks after me :)
[12:17:18] <schinckel> Sometimes you need to give some love back though ;)
[12:17:39] <schinckel> (Getting a reasonably large feature merged into Django is one of my high points)
[12:19:20] <dre> :o
[12:19:24] <dre> if only I could think of something
[12:19:40] <dre> django already blasts away my dumbest ideas and replaces them with awesome ones
[12:19:40] <dre>  
[12:19:55] <dre> I need to think up something great for it to be worthy of django

[17:01:33] <hackedhead> what's best practice for using Class Base Views when I want to show only a subset of data about a model instance? (For example, looking at a Student's related courses, but restricted to a single Semester at a time, /student/<student_id>/semester/<semester_id>/ ? )
[17:02:31] <hackedhead> subclass ModelDetailView for Student and do extra parsing of the request to filter from the URL?
[17:03:07] <dodo> custom get_object?
[17:03:24] <dodo> not really sure what you're trying to do though, or why
[17:03:49] <dodo> do you want to protect against leaking data?

[17:15:06] <hackedhead> not so much leakage as overload of data
[17:15:38] <hackedhead> all information about a Student is too much data to be useful. one semester at a time is managable/actionable.
[17:16:16] <hackedhead> so the question is what's the best practive for urls patterns/views that captures that join
[17:16:56] <hackedhead> or maybe the answer is "just use a function based view" because the request doesn't align well with CBV?
[17:17:10] <hackedhead> since it's not a "whole" class instance?
[17:17:11] <hylje> i've usually used a serializer library like DRF to pick what fields to include
[17:17:32] <hylje> then it's just a matter of providing a custom serializer that spits out just the fields you want to each view
[17:18:07] <hackedhead> .. DRF seems like the wrong approach here, as I'm not writing an API
[17:18:37] <hylje> if you're just giving model objects to templates to render it doesn't really matter what fields it contains
[17:18:50] <hylje> the template just declines to use the fields that it doesn't need
[17:19:59] <hylje> (for curiosity it's also possible to use serializers to process template context, essentially providing an API to the template distinct from the model objects)
[17:21:47] <hackedhead> I think since I want the template context to be the result of a join (Student x Semester), I should just use a function based view instead of a CBV, since it's not a common pattern view around a single model. Maybe I just needed to say that "out loud" to convince myself it's the right way.
[17:21:53] *** Quits: rje (~rje@50.54.137.153) (Quit: My computer has gone to sleep. ZZZzzz…)
[17:22:10] <hackedhead> Maybe I'm just over-eager for everything to be CBVs and that's actually not correct all the time.
[17:23:08] <hylje> if it's an one off use case most of the benefits of a CBV fall right off
[17:23:34] <hylje> but if you have a pattern of (X x Semester) for example you could encode that logic in a mixin
[17:23:55] <hackedhead> thats probably the way, yes.
[17:24:17] <hackedhead> Student X Semester, Room x Semester, Instructor x Semester
[17:24:57] <hackedhead> maybe I'll extract that pattern once I see how the functions shake out.
[17:25:01] <hackedhead> thanks!

[21:34:26] <hemebond> It depends entirely on what the change is and how your app is structured.
[21:35:21] <hemebond> I don't really know what kind of change you're trying to make.
[21:35:33] <hemebond> But it's database schema management.
[21:36:19] <hemebond> e.g., http://nothing.tmtm.com/2009/02/gradual-deployment-of-schema-changes/ but you also need to manage it through Django (because of the ORM).
[21:36:34] <withered_wolf> @relationalalgebr if you make changes/migrations in your local dev environment (on a different git branch I would assume) it should never hit your production environment. Then the production app would work fine and you could play around locally.
[21:36:51] <withered_wolf> The changes will never be live in production until you run the command to migrate the production database
[21:37:04] <withered_wolf> so your app will still be functioning on the old DB schema until you migrate it
[21:38:28] <hemebond> Steve-Dusty: Are you following the documentation on using a custom user model?
[21:38:34] <Steve-Dusty> yes..
[21:38:53] <Steve-Dusty> my book ask me to create a forms.py...
[21:38:56] <hemebond> And your issue now is... you want the admin to reflect the new model? It's not automatic?
[21:39:03] <Steve-Dusty> the documentation full example doesn't use a forms.py
[21:39:17] <Steve-Dusty> what??? I don't need to apply it to admin.py??
[21:39:20] <hemebond> Hmm? Why do you need that? You need an adminform
[21:39:31] <hemebond> Well, I don't know.
[21:39:41] <hemebond> I've not used a custom user model in a long time. Did you check the admin?
[21:40:07] <Steve-Dusty> this certainly would not work
[21:40:15] <Steve-Dusty> I want to make sure login takes email and password
[21:40:23] <Steve-Dusty> signup takes email, password, and username
[21:40:27] <relationalalgebr> thank you hemebond and withered_wolf, let's say I have a Customer model and the new version I add a new field "Phone". I run migrations so the database will have new phone column. In this case, will the old version still run or will it show error because the table has a "Phone" field which is not defined in it's Customer model?
[21:40:29] <Steve-Dusty> that 5 lines of code wont accomplish that
[21:42:14] <withered_wolf> @relationalalgebr if it's a required field, when you run the makemigrations command after changing the model, it will prompt you for a 'default value' specifically so the app doesn't blow up. If not required? All the existing data will just have an empty phone attribute and the app should work.[
[21:42:34] <hemebond> relationalalgebr: I'm assuming you mean applying the migration without updating the app. I don't know off the top of my head. Easy to test though. I've definitely used newer models without applying migrations. Not sure about the reverse.

[22:05:41] <Steve-Dusty> why are there 0 tutorials on explaining how to write the most generic authentication system - email, username, password on signup. email, password through login.
[22:05:57] <lorcab> You would normally commit your model code and your migrations together, so when you check out a revision you would have the Model code coupled with the migrations it needs
[22:05:59] <Steve-Dusty> all of them are just "you can login with both username and email"

[22:07:40] <lorcab> create a custom User model without a username field
[22:07:51] <Steve-Dusty> But I want people to sign up with username
[22:08:00] <Steve-Dusty> I created a custom user model with email
[22:08:03] <relationalalgebr> hemebond, thanks for the link!
[22:08:17] <hemebond> You'll have to write a custom view that first tries the input as a username, then an email address.
[22:09:04] <Steve-Dusty> why?
[22:09:05] <Steve-Dusty> https://dpaste.org/63qN
[22:09:10] <Steve-Dusty> why  not just add an email field
[22:09:25] <Steve-Dusty> I have 0 idea on how to configure login
[22:09:48] <hemebond> Oh, I thought you wanted one field in the login form that would accept a username or email address.
[22:09:57] <Steve-Dusty> no
[22:10:05] <Steve-Dusty> I want to be able to login as Email not username
[22:10:12] <Steve-Dusty> unlike the default system
[22:10:13] <Steve-Dusty> https://dpaste.org/wQR5
[22:10:15] <Steve-Dusty> I got this error
[22:10:41] <Steve-Dusty> ik it's my __str__ inside models.py
[22:10:48] <hemebond> USERNAME_FIELD = 'email'
[22:10:58] <Steve-Dusty> but since CustomUser inherits from AbstractBaseUser why cant I do return self.username
[22:11:00] <hemebond> Why you doing that if you still want a username field?
[22:11:13] <lorcab> Let me as a question though: if you want them to log in using email, why even have a username field? What's its purpose?
[22:11:19] <Steve-Dusty> because USERNAME field is unique
[22:11:22] <Steve-Dusty> EMAIL_FIELD isn't
[22:11:26] <Steve-Dusty> and the official docs does that
[22:11:34] <Steve-Dusty> lorcab for display
[22:11:43] <lorcab> you can make it unique in the custom model
[22:11:57] <lorcab> just add unique=True
[22:12:05] <Steve-Dusty> so I remove USERNAME_FIELD?
[22:12:13] <Steve-Dusty> or change it to EMAIL_FIELD
[22:14:19] <Steve-Dusty> I changed it to EMAIL_FIELD and still can't return self.username
[22:15:42] <Steve-Dusty> nevermind
[22:15:46] <Steve-Dusty> that's now how you do inheritance
[22:18:08] <Steve-Dusty> wait... that's not the problem. it's not in the magic __str__ method returning self.username

[23:06:08] <withered_wolf> Lots of different folks handle scaling and app performance in wildly varying ways.
[23:06:40] <withered_wolf> It's really a matter of your use case as to how to handle that sort of thing
[23:07:07] <withered_wolf> although, I think *any* server that will be outward facing had better be as bullet proof as possible. Otherwise you're bound to have a bad time.
[23:08:44] <theseb> withered_wolf: it seems google app engine takes care of all of that for you?

[23:16:20] <knbk> theseb: yes, GAE can handle the auto-scaling for you. You still need to write a scalable application in the first place
[23:16:45] <CodenameTim> Taking a cursory look at GAE, the flex service only scales the web workers, it won't scale the DB, correct?

[23:17:28] <theseb> knbk: wait..how do you know if you've written a scalable django app?
[23:19:03] <knbk> in general... when it breaks you know it isn't scalable
[23:19:34] <knbk> (performance) testing might help you discover that before production
[23:19:54] <knbk> also don't forget that your wallet needs to auto-scale along with the traffic
[23:20:02] <theseb> knbk: heh
[23:20:38] <theseb> knbk: well for example, my django app was freezing...i just had to set some switches like max # processes and max TTL of each
[23:20:55] <theseb> knbk: so just because it "broke" didn't mean my python was problematic
[23:21:56] <knbk> sure, not every issue is a scalability issue
[23:24:51] <CodenameTim> To add to knbk's comments, a part of a scalable application is handling requests that want to operate on the same instance. For example, if you have a counter that gets incremented on a request. https://dpaste.org/FkRk The bad view would miss an increment if two requests were occurring at the same time. While the second would (depending on the
[23:24:52] <CodenameTim> database and settings, but generally should) update it as you'd expect.
[23:25:31] <CodenameTim> As a specific example of one part of a scalable application, that's not related to throughput.
