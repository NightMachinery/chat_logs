[19:28:48] <alkp> Hi. Sry nt a Django specific doubt. Can anyone help me send a batch_execute statement to AWS RDS using python boto3?
[19:29:22] <alkp> I'm getting parameter validation error and I don't understand the format of sending batch requests from the docs..
[19:29:28] <apollo13> kezabelle: mhm that probably rewrite the whole table
[19:29:40] <kezabelle> apollo13: yiss, indeed
[19:30:05] <apollo13> kezabelle: I wonder though, assume you have User and Profile, can you change User first and then Profile or does changing on user immediatelly break the FK?
[19:30:07] <kezabelle> trying to figure out how much I need to do manually re constraints & triggers and yadda yadda
[19:30:17] <alkp> https://dpaste.org/FhZR
[19:30:41] <alkp> Doc https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/reference/services/rds-data.html#RDSDataService.Client.batch_execute_statement
[19:31:55] <kezabelle> apollo13: yeah I'm going 1 model at a time, but AFAIK the alter table will take an exclusive lock if I try and do the int->bigint in a single DDL command
[19:32:38] <apollo13> the lock makes sense, but do FKs work from int -> bigint or do you have to remove the FK constraint first?
[19:33:19] <apollo13> I wonder if the following is faster: setup a new server with the correct schema
[19:33:23] <kezabelle> the sqlmigrate for one with a bunch of relations certainly indicates that it's dropping the constraints up front, then doing the rewrite, then restoring them
[19:33:33] *** Quits: idontneedanick (~idontneed@h-85-24-184-105.A189.priv.bahnhof.se) (Quit: Leaving...)
[19:33:48] <apollo13> copy data from a backup and then use logical/streaming migration to get the rest over
[19:33:51] <apollo13> and then make the cut over
[19:34:04] <apollo13> well if sqlmigrate is "intelligent" is questionable
[19:34:14] <kezabelle> It's currently looking (to me) like I'll need triggers + not valid constraints + future indexes and concurrentlys and ... well, lots of manual stuff ;)
[19:34:32] <kezabelle> or yes, punch another server into the mix and handle it that way.
[19:35:22] <kezabelle> though that might be complicated by it already being a multi-AZ (hi RDS) something something with encryption and read replicas and ... :o)

[19:36:30] <kezabelle> All the war stories about this certainly suggest doing it manually is either a) the only way or b) they're not using Django/Migrations anyway...
[19:36:42] <kezabelle> apollo13: yep, that's one of the links I've stashed into my ticket.
[19:37:04] <apollo13> but honestly, assuming you are converting all pks
[19:37:12] <apollo13> how long does a data dump & restore take?
[19:37:23] <apollo13> nevermind I forgot RDs
[19:37:29] <kezabelle> chortle :)
[19:37:38] <kezabelle> tbf I don't know the answer anyway
[19:37:50] *** Joins: dez (uid92154@user/dez)
[19:37:59] <apollo13> might be worth to look into though, I mean if you can get away with 1 hour downtime or so
[19:38:04] <kezabelle> I'm currently still at the stage where I daren't even count(*) and I'm just hoping the reltuples are up to date to give me an approx. row count ;)
[19:38:04] <apollo13> how big is the whole db?
[19:39:55] <apollo13> kezabelle: I am kinda annoyed though that you cannot stuff tell PG to stfu
[19:39:58] <kezabelle> 150GB by eyeballing, 47m rows in the most worrisome table, allegedly (if reltuples are up to date)
[19:40:13] <apollo13> in theory it would be nice if it could just make int -> bigint a noop
[19:40:18] <apollo13> and only use it for new rows
[19:40:24] <kezabelle> indeed.
[19:40:46] <apollo13> since rows are stored (afaik) not as fixed length anyways I am not sure how much of a diff it makes (strings are stored variable length in row after all)
[19:40:59] <kezabelle> I guess it's got to pad the indexes and rows though? its not going to end up in TOAST anyway...
[19:41:22] <kezabelle> tbf for all pg's wonderfulness, it's also annoying in a whole bunch of ways ;)
[19:41:37] <apollo13> I doubt that would be easy in most other DBs
[19:42:25] *** Quits: alkp (~alkp@110.225.157.197) (Quit: Leaving)
[19:43:08] <kezabelle> indeed, the difficulty of it is why I was sort of hoping that migrations were super-intelligent about it, or there was a (semi-)official guide for doing it within a Django project ;)
[19:43:16] <apollo13> https://zemanta.github.io/2021/08/25/column-migration-from-int-to-bigint-in-postgresql/
[19:43:21] <apollo13> this looks relatively niec
[19:44:06] <kezabelle> yup, that's the trigger and concurrently and validate parts. Got that set of steps, but across a bunch of other links. Hadn't seen this one :)
[19:44:47] <kezabelle> the recommendation to re-analyze afterwards though, I've not seen that bit before I don't think. Useful.
[19:46:03] <kezabelle> Appreciate your talking things through with me, and digging out new links :D
[19:46:08] <apollo13> Is that one large table just append only?
[19:46:35] <apollo13> although copying over the data into a new table is maybe also not helpful sizewise
[19:46:44] <vlt> kezabelle: Stupid idea from the back seat: Clone the whole database machine and test how it behaves.
[19:47:16] <kezabelle> haha no. I mean, it's "mostly" read only insofar as it's mostly inserts, but it's not guaranteed and data can mutate anywhere in the table.
[19:47:28] <apollo13> only $deity knows how RDS behavs :D
[19:47:43] <kezabelle> vlt: not a stupid idea, absolutely going to have to do that just to see how bad the downtime would be if I just did it the "simple" way

[19:48:16] <kezabelle> e.g. an hour's downtime? I'll probably eat it just for operational simplicity. A day? bleh time to do it all manually with a fine-toothed comb :)
[19:49:50] <kezabelle> Might also be able to clone it into a honking powerful instance and see if that improves things enough that the time + cost works out ok.
[19:50:08] <apollo13> kezabelle: https://aws.amazon.com/dms/ ?
[19:51:42] <kezabelle> oO where and when has this come along?!
[19:52:04] <apollo13> https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/userguide/CHAP_Source.PostgreSQL.html#CHAP_Source.PostgreSQL.RDSPostgreSQL
[19:52:16] <apollo13> don't ask me I am not really an AWS user :D
[19:52:48] <kezabelle> heh :) this is super interesting, thanks.
[19:54:20] <apollo13> I mean I have no idea what it costs

[22:46:34] <artifishul> ORM noob question. I've got ModelA - m2m -> ModelB -> Generic Relation ModelC. I want to return a list of everything at the end there, all the ModelC's from my modelA. I don't even know what to search though so find what I'm looking for on stack overflow or anything. Anyone mind pointing me in the right direction?

[23:27:32] <jim> for one thing, you can use the djqango shell, import the models and experiment
[23:28:56] <jim> as you learn more ways to read and manipulate data in models, you can incorporate that code
