[02:39:58] <catern> with open windows, seems pretty clearly better
[02:39:58] <Obormot\Arcturus> This ain't SF, can't be freezing your ass off while you eat your artisanal steak or w/e
[02:40:07] <catern> in winter yes, dubious
[02:40:15] <catern> but then in winter who wants to eat outdoors anyway
[02:40:27] <catern> better to stay home if you don't want to go inside
[02:40:29] <Obormot\Arcturus> Nobody, which is why they turn the outdoors into indoors, lol

[02:50:03] <ggreer> Gurkenglas: you have to watch out for reflections. UV will give you cataracts
[02:50:42] <ggreer> you could make everyone wear goggles and bathe the place in UV. they might have an increased risk of sunburn and skin cancer, but whatever
[02:51:00] <rmmh> aren't they proposing UV-C to kill viruses that gets absorbed by the layer of tears?
[02:51:05] <Gurkenglas> Are all photoreceptors reflective?
[02:51:26] <saturn2> everyone knows coronaviruses can teleport through walls as long as they are less than 2 inches thick
[02:53:17] <ggreer> that would be really weird if germicidal lamps which are designed to destroy nucleic acids somehow didn't destroy our eye cells

[02:55:27] <rmmh> We should note, though, that while eye exposures to UVC may cause extreme discomfort, the symptoms usually subside within a rather short time, and no evidence of any malignant effects has ever been noted.
[02:55:38] <rmmh> yeah the corneal burning hurts like a bitch, but it's fine, probably

[02:59:18] <rmmh> it's ok 95% of this 10W UV laser won't get to the living skin cells
[02:59:30] <kuudes> you could use air filtration?
[03:00:07] <rmmh> UVC as part of air filtration is probably a decent idea
[03:00:18] <kuudes> it is used
[03:00:24] <ggreer> you have to make sure the ozone doesn't get too high
[03:01:04] <kuudes> my portable air purifier has uv, hpa and electric and was there still some fourth method I don't remember
[03:01:19] <Obormot\Arcturus> catern: Yeah I see many like that around here

[03:02:19] <saturn2> there's not really any need for deadly lasers, regular old air filters will do
[03:02:44] <kuudes> yes
[03:03:01] <kuudes> ikea sells such for some tens of euros, and they even look nice
[03:03:03] <saturn2> if you need to make them deadly maybe you could strap a chainsaw on them or something like that
[03:03:13] <ggreer> there's no way that little thing can make a dent in any volume bigger than a phone booth
[03:03:25] <kuudes> it just sprays clean air to your face
[03:03:56] <kuudes> it does not protect you from droplets etc, but it seems possible it is ok for viral air displacement
[03:04:16] <ggreer> yeah but what's your tidal volume? half a liter? you breathe air faster than that thing can filter
[03:05:13] <kuudes> no, it makes air faster than you breathe
[03:05:18] <kuudes> but it is uncertain if that is enough
[03:05:40] <kuudes> but it is clearly at least faster than a liter per second
[03:05:46] <kuudes> *per 2 seconds
[03:07:03] <ggreer> they claim 12L/min
[03:07:06] <kuudes> 1 liter per second would be 3600 liters per hour, so 3,6 m¬≥ per hour
[03:10:15] <ggreer> my guess is that it helps but such a tiny amount that it's not worthwhile
[03:10:47] <ggreer> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXPwzaaiGE0 even in the kickstarter video they have to speed it up, and that's only a 12L box

[03:12:08] <kuudes> processor fan seems capable of 60 m¬≥/h
[03:13:21] <kuudes> it has been tested and works ok with presumptions; ie if you only breathe what it outputs, you won't get sick. and likely the output should be enough. but there could be too much mixing, that is the hard part
[03:13:42] <kuudes> on the other hand, at least so far it has been meaningful to reduce the viral load in the air
[03:13:54] <kuudes> ie good air conditioning counts as 1/4 on microcovid
[03:14:08] <kuudes> so less than ffp2 but better than a rag

[03:19:43] <ggreer> a processor fan can't generate enough pressure to force air through any sort of effective filter
[03:22:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> Not a filter that fine, no
[03:22:34] <Obormot\Arcturus> It does perfectly well if what you want to filter is dust and relatively coarse particulates

[05:04:44] <quanticle> I would have figured that the kitten would have just dragged the whole thing to the floor
[05:05:42] <gwern> it might be in the middle of doing that. assuming it's statically stable, my best guess would be that the kitten is lighter than you think, the phone heavier than you think, and the acute angle pulling down avoids just laterally dragging it over the edge
[05:06:37] <quanticle> Oh, it's a phone, not an external HDD, lol
[05:06:47] <quanticle> But yeah, I guess it's a very light cat

[05:13:55] <gwern> that's a good point, it's got a sort of rim to it, and most cases are grippy/rubbery
[05:14:23] <catern> a good proof of my autism is that I only recently realized that the response to "hello, how are you" is not "i'm okay. [continue onto meaningful conversation]" but rather "i'm fine, how are you?"
[05:15:03] <dv^_^> is autism like living in a foreign land?
[05:15:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> catern: We were just talking about that the other day
[05:15:35] <catern> i can't say, i've never lived in a foreign land

[05:16:19] <catern> because that's why I'm mentioning it lol
[05:16:35] <catern> just because it has "hello how are you im fine how are you" as a random minor example

[05:16:46] <quanticle> But I have no idea what it would do
[05:16:50] <phill> "frame control" is from PUA
[05:17:13] <phill> I would be like, "what exactly do you mean by how am I?"
[05:17:29] <catern> phill: perhaps you too are autistic (self-diagnosed)
[05:17:46] <quanticle> Not all misanthropy is autism
[05:17:50] <phill> no, i'm not autistic, but likely just avoidant/lack social skills
[05:18:05] <phill> (i went to see a psych exactly bc of this)
[05:18:07] <catern> i should go to a therapist so i can get diagnosed with ADHD and autism
[05:18:16] <catern> or psychologist, whatever
[05:18:18] <catern> therapists can't do that
[05:18:22] <phill> I *did* score highly on the autism tests they used though
[05:18:22] <quanticle> I'm perfectly capable of following the script, I just choose not to because 95% of the time I don't give a shit
[05:18:28] <catern> then I can have those feats on my character sheet

[05:19:06] <phill> like if you just went by the tests, i have autism, but there are quite a few things that don't fit

[05:19:39] <phill> well, those are neurologists/surgeons xD
[05:19:43] <quanticle> Wait, being autistic gives you the frame-control feat? I thought it was the other way around; being autistic made you vulnerable to frame control.
[05:19:54] <catern> no the "Autistic" and "ADHD" feats

[05:21:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> Malus is a dumb and fake word

[05:21:56] <gwern> catern: maybe to you, but the 'mal' root there makes it sound even more malicious to me than penalty
[05:21:57] <quanticle> I think I'd make it give like a -1 to WIS as well
[05:22:37] <catern> gwern: i mean... mal is evil, bon is good...
[05:23:00] <phill> wait what
[05:23:08] <phill> malus is an actual english word?
[05:23:11] <phill> interesting
[05:23:11] <catern> they've been paired before https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vince_malum_bono
[05:23:12] <Robomot> Vince malum bono - Wikipedia (Vince malum bono or Vince in bono malum is a Latin phrase meaning Overcome evil with good or Defeat Evil with Good.)
[05:23:21] <gwern> now, if you want to switch to malus/bonus, I can give my classics benediction to that: https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/malus#Latin 'antonym: bonus'
[05:23:22] <Robomot> malus - Wiktionary [Latin]
[05:23:39] <quanticle> I don't know how I'd model ADD in third edition, but in fifth, I'd model it as having disadvantage on all saving throws that use the WIS stat
[05:23:46] <catern> gwern: huh, why the change of heart? that's what i've been saying the whole time
[05:23:53] <quanticle> Like, ADD kids know they're doing something dumb, they just can't help themselves
[05:24:09] <gwern> catern: oh, I thought you were using it for both 'bonuses' and 'bonuses that subtract'
[05:24:13] <quanticle> Hence the disadvantage; you roll twice, and whichever is lower is the roll you get
[05:24:31] <phill> i was familiar for the latin word malus...didn't know there was an english definition
[05:24:33] <saturn2> Malus  n 1: apple trees; found throughout temperate zones of the northern hemisphere [syn: {Malus}, {genus Malus}]
[05:24:34] <catern> gwern: ah, no, yeah, bonus is bonus and malus is "bonus-that-subtracts"
[05:24:55] <gwern> phill: I'm not sure if you'd call it 'actual'... certainly it's not a word you see much, and wiktionary only attests it to 1997... this might be a 'gretchen, stop trying to make malus happen. it's not going to happen.' situation
[05:25:00] <catern> phill: well uh I may have made it up
[05:25:07] <catern> I'm pretty sure I've seen malus in games though
[05:25:14] <gwern> wiktionary mentions that, yes
[05:25:45] <quanticle> That's because games are designed and written by exactly the same sorts of autists who look at bonus and think, "Nah, penalty isn't symmetric... what about... *malus*?"
[05:26:20] <dv^_^> all words are made up
[05:26:22] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Penalty" is the canonical term
[05:26:22] <gwern> ...on the other hand... the OED does *not* record it, despite wiktionary's 'rare'. hm. so it's a /hisses a latinizing neologism!
[05:26:26] <catern> the good sorts of autists
[05:26:34] <Obormot\Arcturus> Note that there is also a general term "modifier" which encompasses "bonus" and "penalty"
[05:26:46] <catern> gwern: bonus is essentially latin already
[05:26:57] <gwern> catern: ah yes, but it is hallowed by centuries of use
[05:27:01] <Obormot\Arcturus> (This is needed becauses a bonus cannot be negative, a penalty cannot be positive, but a modifier can positive, negative, or zero)
[05:27:03] <catern> Obormot\Arcturus: I prefer to call those simply uses
[05:27:08] <catern> us-es
[05:27:10] <Obormot\Arcturus> catern: trbl. shame.
[05:27:15] <quanticle> ^
[05:27:28] <gwern> catern: malus is a parvenu word. actually, it's not even nouveau riche or arriviste, because that would imply it'd arrived
[05:27:31] <catern> ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
[05:28:07] <catern> gwern: yes, but it serves a valuable industrial function
[05:28:09] <nshepperd2> alexander wales says 'malus', that makes it a real word
[05:28:23] <catern> nshepperd2: aha! I probably picked it up from him yeah
[05:30:27] <catern> Obormot\Arcturus: modifier is an acceptable term for bonus/malus, yes
[05:30:43] <catern> although something more obscure and inscrutable would be nicer
[05:33:34] <quanticle> Modifier? I hardly know-er
[05:34:33] <saturn2> how can a modifier be zero? that would make it an identifier
[05:34:46] <gwern> it's an infintesimal modifier, of course
[05:35:13] <gwern> you approach zero from either -1 or +1 depending on whether it was a malus or bonus
[05:35:17] <catern> nonus
[05:35:39] <gwern> this has important implications for when a wizard casts an infinite loop spell - will the malus/bonus converge and to what sum?
[05:36:12] <vrs> depends on what the logical substrate of the spell is
[05:37:25] <vrs> -1/0/+1 depending on what came first and what came last, and in realistic scenarios "glitched" is also possible

[06:07:02] <feepbot> <gwern> 'Dave Denkenberger: Yeah. Obviously people can‚Äôt eat all seaweed, and even at the level of relatively small number of calories, there‚Äôs concern about getting too much iodine, if you look at the upper limit of iodine. However, there was an interesting natural experiment, where some Peace Corps workers thought they were taking a supplement, but they were actually taking
[06:07:02] <feepbot> iodine tablets that were used to purify water. So they were, for over a year, ingesting 50 times the upper limit of iodine. Rob Wiblin: Per day. Dave Denkenberger: Per day. Rob Wiblin: Okay, yeah. Dave Denkenberger: And they only had minor conditions, and they were reversible. So I think this shows that we can push it farther than normally recommended. And that could get you up to,
[06:07:02] <feepbot> perhaps, a quarter of your calories. Now of course, there‚Äôs the issue of whether you want to eat that much seaweed, but then again, if the alternative is starvation‚Ä¶'
[06:07:46] <quanticle> Yeah, but from rmmh's link it seems like the actual thing is some kind of vat-grown protein

[09:57:46] <PapuaHardyNet> what went great
[09:58:01] <quanticle> So uh, what was their reply to the AI safety question? Was it, "Paperclips? Oh no, we're going to turn you all into staples!"
[09:58:16] <PapuaHardyNet> oh, the generally intelligent meet
[09:59:15] <shawwwn> They're doing some really neat work with video. One of their experiments was to make a model that predicts the motion of a ball as it rolls across a floor, and then try to make it learn object permanence by having it roll under a table. (If the model has object permanence, it should know the ball still exists)
[09:59:53] <shawwwn> I made sure to ask about AI safety towards the end, and we both agreed that it would be awesome to become paperclips
[10:00:06] <shawwwn> actually she said that different members of the team feel different ways about it
[10:00:38] <shawwwn> the research team is small (~9 people) plus 3 remote ML engineers, so it's an interesting group
[10:00:57] <quanticle> Okay, as long as you're the cool kind of paperclip that just sits there and holds my papers together and not the annoying kind of paperclip that pops up in the lower-right of my screen asking if I need help writing a letter or w/e
[10:01:27] <Obormot\Gaia> Meanwhile, I continue to make my way through Appendix N. This time: Gardner Fox
[10:01:50] <shawwwn> (someone should make clippy: the later years, where he's in a retirement home annoying all the secretaries)
[10:02:32] <Obormot\Gaia> Reading _Kothar: Barbarian Swordsman_ (first of a whole Kothar series). Written 1969. *Directly* inspired the D&D lich (as opposed to the indirect / original inspiration which was, of course, Koschei the Deathless)
[10:03:29] <Obormot\Gaia> On the whole Kothar is basically a cut-rate Conan... writing's not as good, character not as compelling, basically an inferior imitation (and a rather transparent one), but fun enough for a casual read
[10:04:04] <Obormot\Gaia> Much more D&D-esque than many earlier works. Dungeon-crawling is just straightforwardly there, in an almost archetypical D&D form
[10:05:34] <PapuaHardyNet> it must be rather boring to read a D&D log in a narrative form
[10:05:48] <Obormot\Gaia> Various other D&D stuff visible in obvious prototype (Wind Walk spell, e.g., and also the whole "weak wizard needs strong fighter type to protect him from pesky enemy warriors while he does his big magic to marshal cosmic forces and prevail in a mighty magical struggle" thing is spelled out pretty much literally)
[10:05:54] <PapuaHardyNet> "he hit the goblin for 12 damage! the goblin bit him for 2 damage!"

[10:09:39] <Obormot\Gaia> Anyway, more re: Gardner Fox. The guy wrote a lot of comics (Golden and Silver Age) ... those and his novels are explicitly inspired by the earlier pulps and so on (Burroughs was a big inspiration). It definitely shows... so what Gygax took from Fox was basically the earlier stuff, pre-digested into easier-to-process form

[10:10:42] <Obormot\Gaia> Fortunately Gygax *also* read much of the earlier stuff, so his work is not really degenerate relative to Fox's; but this shows that the process of "inspired by work that was inspired by work that was inspired by ..." had already started then
[10:10:51] <Obormot\Gaia> And with corrosive effects on quality
[10:11:06] <Obormot\Gaia> But also lol:
[10:11:09] <Obormot\Gaia> "A polymath, Fox included numerous real-world historical, scientific, and mythological references in his comic strips, once saying, "Knowledge is kind of a hobby with me".[8] For instance, during a year's worth of Atom comic strip stories, Fox referred to the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, the space race, 18th-century England, miniature card painting, Norse mythology, and numismatics."
[10:12:04] <quanticle> He would fit right in here
[10:12:08] <rsaarelm> It's a fun dynamic. Kids who want to become comic book writers don't read anything except comic books and then get confused when people call the stuff they write total crap and they don't see any way to get better.
[10:12:14] <Obormot\Gaia> "During July 1939, just two issues after debut of the character Batman by artist Bob Kane and writer Bill Finger, Fox wrote the first of his several tales for that character,[17] introducing an early villain in the story "The Batman Meets Doctor Death".[18] Alongside Kane and Finger, Fox contributed to the evolution of the character, including the character's first use of his utility belt, which "contain[ed] choking gas
[10:12:14] <Obormot\Gaia>  capsules,"[18] as well as writing the first usages of both the Batarang and the Batgyro, an autogyro precursor to the Batcopter, two issues later.[19]" ... gosh

[18:40:56] <rsaarelm> And then you can just go "eh, might as well blow my brains out if this gets fucked up" with unwrap.
[18:43:25] <feep[work]> I         guess?

[18:47:02] <rsaarelm> It's pretty well-entrenched in Rust that it provides the most general-purpose but maybe somewhat clunky primitives and then you can build more opinionated machinery on top of it.

[18:48:03] <rsaarelm> Generally you want to push the suicide option as close to the top of the program as possible, libraries shouldn't panic.
[18:48:47] <rsaarelm> At least in cases where it makes more sense to return an error, there are some data structure invariant violations where it's just "eh, panic if this won't work"

[20:06:04] <Gurkenglas> nlsh helps a lot with linux being a pain, by the way.
[20:10:11] <Gurkenglas> I will in any case need some cloud compute. Can y'all recommend a place to get a linux remote with a GPU for ML experiments?
[20:10:37] <Gurkenglas> Ideally the GPU would not be dedicated to me because I may well only use it 1% of the time.
[20:11:42] <PapuaHardyNet> well, I have access to a remote workstation with an nvidia quadro 5000, although I do my testing and prototyping on my x230 regardless
[20:12:32] <PapuaHardyNet> although on second thoughts, it probably isn't worth it due to the network restrictions my college places on the workstation
[20:12:57] <Gurkenglas> Is that enough to calculate a jacobian between one input to the InceptionV1 network and all its activations? Or is that an astronomical ask?
[20:13:57] <PapuaHardyNet> how about I send you an ssh and you decide?
[20:14:07] <Gurkenglas> (That takes O(number of numbers in one input * number of activations) time and space.)
[20:14:15] <Gurkenglas> Sure, why not :).
[20:14:32] <Gurkenglas> By network restrictions do you mean bandwidth?
[20:16:31] <PapuaHardyNet> nope, my uni network (in which the workstation lies) uses a proxy thing. Very problematic. afaict the workstation doesn't face that issue and you don't need to think about proxies
[20:16:57] <PapuaHardyNet> however, I manually set the dns at times, and some servers don't resolve, which means the uni network is still tampering with connections
[20:17:18] <PapuaHardyNet> I would use a VPN to avoid the tampering entirely, but I'm not very enthusiastic about using remotes all that much anyway

[21:46:13] <ggreer> last night I had a fever of 102. all of my joints ached so much that I could barely sit up to drink water. the muscles on the left side of my body above my waist were also extremely painful to use
[21:46:54] <ggreer> but now I just have a slight headache and I'm a little cold
[21:50:27] <Gurkenglas> Could the legislature just pass literally the above and let the legislature decide on the particulars?
[21:50:35] <Gurkenglas> *let the judicature
[21:51:11] <adiabatic> wha'ts a judicature
[21:51:22] <adiabatic> the faceless drones of the executive branch?
[21:51:28] <ggreer> there's a law that says hospitals must make their prices public, but the hospitals don't follow it
[21:51:52] <Gurkenglas> no, the faceless drones of the judicative branch.
[21:52:12] <adiabatic> judicial branch?
[21:52:31] <Gurkenglas> google says oxford languages says i can use judicature
[21:52:57] <adiabatic> nobody here calls it that
[21:53:26] <Gurkenglas> sure, we can say judicial branch. judge judy.
[21:53:42] <adiabatic> but the judicial branch doesn't do its own enforcement outside its own areana. that's why we have the exclusionary rule (see Mapp) and not the judicial branch going out and controlling how cops collect evidence
[21:53:48] <adiabatic> arena*
[21:54:44] <Gurkenglas> i thought a law can say "reasonable" and then the judges interpret that. like they interpret "hardcore pornography"
[21:55:36] <adiabatic> a lot of interpretation of laws happens by the people who draft not the laws (in the legislative branch), but people in the executive branch who have to turn those laws into regulations
[21:56:15] <Gurkenglas> Makes sense. So the legislature could pass literally that and then the executive branch implements it.

[22:15:20] <ggreer> I did
[22:15:46] <kuudes> fever of 40C or more is considered a notable adverse effect, and in the research cases that is the limit when one needs to contact doctor

[23:08:26] <Robomot> Beyond Folk Activism | Cato Unbound
[23:09:09] <catern> i.e.: talking to people and trying to persuade them is something you do just because it's your social instinct, it's not necessarily the most effective way to pursue your goals
[23:12:23] <catern> (that article has been hugely influential on me tbh)
[23:14:21] <Obormot\Arcturus> How so
[23:14:44] <Betawolf> seems to mostly be arguing that being libertarian is a waste of time, while accidentally endorsing bitcoin
[23:17:26] <catern> Obormot\Arcturus: how so what?
[23:17:45] <Obormot\Arcturus> Influential how
[23:17:48] <catern> Betawolf: if that's your takeaway then the part of your brain which does generalization is severely atrophied
[23:18:23] <catern> Obormot\Arcturus: well I've spent less time on talk and more time on action over my life because of this article
[23:19:01] <Obormot\Arcturus> Interesting
[23:20:17] <Betawolf> 'less talk, more action' is easy to say, but what action does it even discuss?
[23:20:33] <Betawolf> seasteading is dumb, market anarchism would be hell, crypto-anarchy is useful but can't solve everything, the FSP is good but won't save you.

[23:22:12] <otoburb> ggreer: Sounds like you had stronger side effects from the 3rd dose than from the other two.
[23:22:21] <catern> a vague "less talk, more action" would be fine, but something that more specifically suggests that people systematically over-talk and under-act, is more interesting
[23:22:48] <ggreer> otoburb: no the second was the worst. I took about a week to be fully recovered from that one
[23:22:52] <catern> (it's so I can link it from http://catern.com/constructive.html instead of linking to Beyond folk activism)
[23:22:52] <Robomot> Give constructive proofs of your ideas
[23:23:29] <Betawolf> hmm. I guess that might be tricky, you're looking for a 'how to do better activism' post but only activists post that stuff and probably generally about their causes.
[23:25:02] <Betawolf> perhaps some articles about slacktivism?
[23:25:05] <otoburb> Ok good to know. 
[23:25:40] <catern> Betawolf: I don't know if it's purely an activism thing - I think it happens also in lots of projects - like bikeshedding for example
[23:26:15] <catern> but whereas the word "bikeshedding" is more "Don't focus on trivial issues", I'm looking for more "Don't focus on talking"
[23:26:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> "I also happen to be a former Monastic Academy apprentice and am the one who brought them up earlier. In ten years of nonprofit service I have never personally encountered a more high risk, dysfunctional, authoritarian/hierarchal, unethical, sexist and abusive organization.

[23:26:42] <Obormot\Arcturus> Nice, nice
[23:27:23] <catern> Betawolf: slacktivism is a good keyword though
[23:28:14] <Betawolf> There's a quote "There's no use talking about the problem unless you talk about the solution." which seems connected.
[23:28:56] <Betawolf> Though 'talking about the solution' is a poor fit actually.
[23:28:56] <catern> tangentially, another thing about https://www.cato-unbound.org/2009/04/06/patri-friedman/beyond-folk-activism/ - the first sentence is really poetic and evocative, I like the article for that
