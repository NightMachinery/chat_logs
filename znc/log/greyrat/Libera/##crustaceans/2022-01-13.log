[00:43:52] <ngoldbaum> that’s pretty fucked up
[00:44:20] <manicennui> Maybe they are working on it.
[00:44:38] <manicennui> He is certainly giving them ammo.
[00:46:51] <manicennui> CEO also made it clear in his recent update (anti-vaxxer was basically responding to this update) that the company is requiring vaccination regardless of whether people are fully remote at least partially to make the company's position on such matters clear.

[02:59:36] <skyl4rk> so my option for when I need to go places further away than I can bicycle, or when the weather does not permit, is mass transit, hah hah ha no
[02:59:57] <manicennui> What is wrong with mass transit?
[03:00:52] <skyl4rk> lots of people in a confined space during a pandemic that is currently seeing increasing numbers of infections pretty much across the board?
[03:01:18] <manicennui> Sure, at the moment.
[03:01:35] <skyl4rk> it as been at the moment for quite some time now
[03:01:47] <manicennui> I guess I forget that some people can't self isolate for weeks at a time.
[03:02:57] <skyl4rk> I am not at all opposed to mass transit in non-pandemic times
[03:07:07] <bontaq> ah yeah mass transit is a little tough during these times, I want to get one of those bodysuits off amazon
[03:13:32] <skyl4rk> I made a trip by train last year-wore a face mask, then I read that that class of mask is rated for protecting others against you so to speak, sigh. On the return trip I hedged my bets and wore one of each kind on top of each other, taped to my face along the edges. I already know nurses and doctors have a shit situation, but walking to the train station with that was an experience.
[03:15:51] <skyl4rk> For a lot of the time every inhalation and exhalation was a conscious effort, like some sort of breathing exercise. I would not want to have to work or try to be any kind of intelligent with that kind of setup.

[16:24:29] <Brekkjern> Now the question. Should I take the rest of the day off, or should I go in to work?
[16:24:38] <riv> take the day off :)
[16:24:43] <Brekkjern> Leaning towards that, yeah
[16:24:55] <Brekkjern> I'm not sure I have the motivation to work after an exam...
[16:26:31] <Brekkjern> Dunno what to do, but at least it won't be work :P
[16:27:10] <riv> ive recently taken up doing absolutely nothing
[16:27:16] <riv> not exactly by choice
[16:27:39] <Brekkjern> How so?
[16:28:02] <riv> idk< I just haven't been feeling a game or tv show
[16:31:53] <Brekkjern> I know that feeling
[16:32:12] <Brekkjern> Honestly, I've felt kinda depressed since mid november
[16:35:56] <riv> aw
[16:36:01] <riv> it's a tough one
[16:36:10] <riv> I hope you feel better soon!
[16:42:40] <Brekkjern> Eh. It's basically a lack of motivation and joy from anything
[16:42:58] <Brekkjern> Will probably be better now that the exam is over, but I'll still have it looming over me in June I guess...
[16:49:42] <riv> it's so difficult to just enjoy yourself when you have something looming like that
[16:49:53] <riv> I know that feeling well
[16:51:21] <riv> I have some hobby programming I want to do but literally 0 motivation, so it's a total slog
[16:51:42] <Brekkjern> Yeah, same

[16:53:14] <riv> you get to learn the fastest :)
[16:53:30] <Brekkjern> I've been making clips out of scenes in Arcane for a group of other people since I have it in 4k
[16:53:51] <Brekkjern> And after I started getting the hang of the software I figured I'd try to actually edit some of the scenes together
[16:54:27] <riv> Ah I really want to watch Arcane, because of the clips here. It looks so cool
[16:54:44] <Brekkjern> It is an amazing show. IMO easily the best thing released last year.
[16:55:11] <Brekkjern> And I don't really care for the "cool" scenes and such. The emotional moments are amazingly well done.
[16:55:56] <Brekkjern> And the animation is breathtaking at times

[16:58:32] <Brekkjern> But I'm realizing that it takes a lot more work than you'd expect to make things flow well
[17:01:05] <Brekkjern> riv: If you give Arcane a shot, try watching 3 and 3 episodes at a time if you can. They were made kinda like story arcs. Gives the best experience IMO.
[17:01:13] <riv> okay
[17:01:23] <riv> im planning to watch to tonight, ty!
[17:01:29] <Brekkjern> Enjoy :)
[17:02:08] <Brekkjern> The first arc is a bit slow though. The third episode kicks things off.

[20:09:44] <manicennui> Thank god
[20:20:43] <jlindgren> lucky you
[20:20:45] <jlindgren> good stuff
[20:21:02] <Geekingfrog> jlindgren http3 is built on top of quic, which is "merely" the transport part (on top of udp). QUIC defines flow control, handshake and stuff, while http3 adds http semantic on top of that.
[20:21:21] <jlindgren> i see. its all UDP from what I read on a quick google
[20:21:23] <jlindgren> which is interesting
[20:22:41] <Geekingfrog> yeah, it implements handshake, flow and congestion control, ordering and retry in "userland", on top of udp. It's supposedly pretty good for low latency and roaming
[20:23:46] <manicennui> Last night I made the mistake of commenting on reddit for the first time in years to correct someone. The person of course doubled down and the idiots kept upvoting their wrong comment. I just deleted my comment and have been in a bad mood ever since.
[20:23:51] <Geekingfrog> low latency because you don't have the head of line blocking of tcp where one dropped packet backs off all the subsequent ones, and roaming because you don't have to rely on the tuple (source addr, source port, dest addr, dest port), so you can switch from wifi to wan for example
[20:23:57] <manicennui> Such a stupid thing to be in a bad mood about, but I can't get my brain to stop.
[20:24:21] <Geekingfrog> damn brains
[20:24:45] <manicennui> I think it might help me to stop spending time on reddit though.
[20:24:56] <jlindgren> reddit does that to me too. i hate it.
[20:24:57] <Geekingfrog> that would be a pretty good thing

[22:21:02] <gwozniak> manicennui: 1999 was an amazing year for movies
[22:21:20] <gwozniak> And 2000 was.... no
[22:21:21] <gwozniak> not
[22:21:45] <manicennui> I don't even like all of those movies, but it is impressive that they all came out in one year.
[22:21:57] <manicennui> But I do like half a dozen of them quite a bit.
[22:24:48] <gwozniak> Just reading about the Firefox bug now.  That's gonna hurt.
[22:24:50] <manicennui> gwozniak: I don't know. 2000 looks pretty damn good too.

[22:35:10] <Brekkjern> Oh man. Dealing with codecs is an infinite pain.
[22:47:21] <gwozniak> The joy of video editing
[22:48:21] <Brekkjern> Yeah
[22:48:51] <gwozniak> So another long time friend of mine has become a baptized member of a church
[22:48:55] <Brekkjern> The worst part is that this file is an mp4 in h246, and for some reason Resolve doesn't recognize it
[22:55:11] <imode> gwozniak: i.e a cult.
[22:55:22] <imode> RIP to your friend.
[22:58:02] <gwozniak> Russian Orthodox, no less
[22:58:27] <ngoldbaum> beard intensifies
[23:02:26] <gwozniak> I wonder about this "getting older, join a church" thing that I heard as a kid
[23:03:18] <manicennui> I become less tolerant of religion as I become older.
[23:08:03] <gwozniak> I accept it at the personal level, that is, if you find peace in it for you, fine.  But as a moral guiding force or anything like that, forget it.
[23:08:34] <manicennui> It never remains that though.
[23:10:49] <manicennui> Even the really "nice" religious people I've known who wouldn't opening attack anyone often have some pretty reprehensible views if you talk to them about specific topics, and I don't see how one can hold those views and not allow them to influence various decisions.
[23:11:24] <gwozniak> This is true, but you also can't force people to not "use" it internally.  As in, you can't make someone think more rationally or scientifically
[23:11:41] <manicennui> Or even simple things, like voting for abhorrent political parties because that party talks about religion a lot.
[23:11:47] <manicennui> gwozniak: Sure.
[23:12:05] <manicennui> I don't think there is a good solution other than to continue to expose people to various things and hope for the best.
[23:12:18] <gwozniak> I find it's mortality that turns people to religious thinking
[23:12:29] <manicennui> I do think religious indoctrination of children is at least mildly abusive though.
[23:12:34] <gwozniak> manicennui: no, there isn't a good solution to it
[23:13:01] <indigo> bkero: Lol, going in for a third adjustment tomorrow
[23:13:15] <bkero> Wow
[23:13:26] <bkero> Good luck, I hope they can do it right that time.
[23:13:52] <indigo> I hope so too. This time I realized the reason I've been losing sleep was because my teeth fit way differently when I have my retainer on :P
[23:14:16] <manicennui> gwozniak: I get a lot of the sentiments about mortality and wondering about how things came to be, but I don't understand why that means one should leap to made up bullshit.
[23:15:30] <gwozniak> Me neither.  But my friend turned to it when his mom died, and his mom was a key part of his life.  I suspect he needs to feel he will see her again
[23:15:55] <gwozniak> I'm content with "when you're gone, you're gone" but other aren't for some reason
[23:16:58] <manicennui> gwozniak: I don't find religious descriptions of the afterlife at all comforting, especially if religious people will be there.
[23:18:42] <imode> tbf if I had the opportunity to hang with god in paradise, I'd be down.
[23:19:03] <manicennui> imode: I don't like their definition of "paradise".
[23:19:10] <manicennui> If it were my definition? Sure.
[23:19:11] <imode> what's their definition of paradise.
[23:19:40] <manicennui> imode: For one, many of the religious assholes will be there.
[23:20:21] <imode> can probably guarantee you that religious assholes aren't getting into the place they preach.
[23:20:28] <imode> if it is consistent.
[23:23:32] <manicennui> imode: I don't mean famous assholes like Pat Robertson.
[23:24:08] <manicennui> I mean the everyday religious assholes who believe they are "good people" while doing their small part to make the lives of others worse, while also being the most boring people imaginable.
[23:25:53] <companion_cube> good and boring isn't incompatible

[23:39:02] <mouseghost> any cool vr games youd recommend to try on quest 2?
[23:40:03] <ngoldbaum> do you have a pc that can run half life alyx?
[23:40:14] <mouseghost> not really :(
[23:40:35] <mouseghost> i mean, there is more pcvr games than there is games that run directly on questtt
[23:40:36] <Xe> mouseghost: Beat Saber, Synth Riders, Population: One, PC ports of classic games via sidequest, umm lemme look through my apps list
[23:41:04] <ngoldbaum> i’ve heard good things about the myst port
[23:41:09] <Xe> Tetris Effect
[23:41:28] <Xe> VRChat if you have friends for it
[23:43:08] <Xe> things to avoid though: Kizuna Ai: Touch The Beat (unplayable "rhythm" game)
[23:44:07] <Geekingfrog> I had a blast with space pirate trainer when I tried it.
[23:44:10] <Xe> here's how bad the Kizuna Ai game is though: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0drsxgKO-g0
[23:44:10] <buttsbot> This Rhythm Game is HORRIBLE - YouTube - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0drsxgKO-g0
[23:44:24] <Xe> this is max difficulty
[23:44:38] <ngoldbaum> superhot vr is good
[23:45:06] <ngoldbaum> yeah there are a lot of bad vr games unfortunately
[23:45:13] <mouseghost> Xe, it sounds out of sync for some reason??

[23:45:35] <drakonis> now this is some good vr
[23:45:52] <mouseghost> thanks for recommendationsss
[23:46:05] <mouseghost> ive heard about that population: one hmm
[23:46:05] <drakonis> hitman 3 with vr...
[23:46:12] <mouseghost> theres also onward
[23:46:41] <drakonis> this is how you do vr
[23:48:42] <Xe> mouseghost: that's because it is
[23:48:59] <Xe> pop 1 is a blast
[23:50:20] <gwozniak> You know you're dealing with some great Python code when the beginning of most functions are 8-10 'global' statements
[23:50:30] <Geekingfrog> oooooh boi
[23:50:33] <mouseghost> lol
[23:50:55] <Geekingfrog> without even a comment like # forgive me Padre ?
[23:52:12] <gwozniak> Nope
[23:52:23] <gwozniak> At least they prefix them with 'g_'
[23:52:48] <manicennui> Remember Hungarian notation?
[23:52:51] <gwozniak> grep -c -e '^g_' offending.py  --> 42
[23:53:54] <Geekingfrog> nice
[23:54:13] <Geekingfrog> many `nonlocal` as well ?
[23:54:17] <gwozniak> One function has 35 global statements
[23:55:14] <gwozniak> This is some firmware project I have to muddle through
[23:56:05] <gwozniak> No 'nonlocal', but I expect this was written for Python 2.7
