[01:01:57] <r00tobo> ideally you would want to self-host your znc instance and connect your computers with it
[01:02:16] <r00tobo> by self-host I mean get a cheap VPS for like 15$/y or something
[01:03:02] <r00tobo> setup znc there and let your weechat connect to it, it will buffer everything for you because it will be connected 24/7 on the internet
[01:04:24] <r00tobo> or you can go the free service route : https://wiki.znc.in/Providers
[01:07:08] <r00tobo> and pkill would just kill the process without saying anything I think

[14:39:28] <perryprog> For some reason, when I connected this morning I didn't get any message playback, even though there should've been according to my logs. Is there any way to force playback to happen?
[14:39:55] <Manara> can i run a server on my house moden?
[14:40:34] <Manara> if i can maintain connectiong with it outside my house 
[14:40:51] <Manara> is it even possible ?
[14:43:34] <DarthGandalf> I'm doing that
[14:43:52] <DarthGandalf> but that depends on your hardware
[14:43:58] <DarthGandalf> if it can run arbitrary programs
[14:44:44] <DarthGandalf> perryprog: what logs? so you got the messages already?
[14:45:10] <perryprog> As in there /should've/ been messages that were played back when I connected but I got nothnig
[14:45:37] <perryprog> I mean logs as in logged by ZNC on my VPS
[14:46:08] <DarthGandalf> you're using only one client?
[14:46:16] <perryprog> Yup
[14:46:31] <DarthGandalf> Maybe ZNC got restarted, or something?
[14:46:54] <DarthGandalf> by default (without [[savebuff]]) restart makes buffers go away
[14:46:54] <ZNC-Linker> https://wiki.znc.in/savebuff
[14:47:44] <perryprog> hmm
[14:48:12] <perryprog> I doubt it. Is there a systemctl command to view a service's uptime?
[14:48:28] <DarthGandalf> no clue, I don't use systemd
[14:48:48] <DarthGandalf> ps aux|grep znc should have the start time though
[14:48:54] <perryprog> oh, right

[15:44:40] <Khaytsus> I"ve never put a finger on why, but I've made changes to znc that didn't show up in the config file for 3-4 days one time, not in file, file way older, saveconfig, then the option was there.  It's like znc doesn't save the config at all unless it exits cleanly or manually saved.

[16:23:21] <Khaytsus> Manara: If you can connect to it from outside depends on your ISP, we can't guess.  Try it.
[16:25:51] <DarthGandalf> r00tobo: that depends on use case. For me there was electricity out only once in years, but I do reboot the computer with client much more often than the router where ZNC is running
[16:30:42] <r00tobo> yeah it varies, for me I need a UPS to run this 24/7
[16:30:59] <r00tobo> getting a VPS somewhere is better
[16:31:33] <r00tobo> you run znc on your router?
[16:31:59] <r00tobo> not all routers can do this especially the stock firmware

[18:58:33] <Czernobog> Whenever I reboot my server, all the data in the znc gets deleted and I have to start from scratch again. Really annoying!  How can I fix this? I am using docker-compose and I have assigned a volume. https://pastebin.com/KxtGVQaa
[19:02:19] *** Mathisen_ is now known as Mathisen
[19:04:12] <qwerty> Czernobog: is the entire volume deleted i.e. you have to create a new config each time? or do you mean channels within the config are?
[19:04:18] <Khaytsus> So that znc image looks for data in /home/unbuntu/znc ?
[19:04:32] *** Joins: Haxxa (~Haxxa@122-199-4-24.ip4.superloop.com)
[19:04:36] <Khaytsus> The official znc image looks at /znc-data by default
[19:05:26] <Khaytsus> Czernobog: <path to data>:/config
[19:05:41] <Khaytsus> Czernobog: Note your compose is.... wrong
[19:06:28] <Khaytsus> Perhaps you meant /home/ubuntu/znc:/config
[19:06:42] <Khaytsus> If you have a local path you want to use as the volume data at /home/ubuntu/znc

[19:11:26] <Czernobog> Khaytsus: omg thank you! I just noticed that! I have migrated to a fresh install couple of time and I usually only backup the docker-compose.yml I guess somewhere in between I messed up and I never even bothered to check!
[19:11:58] <Khaytsus> Czernobog: I'm surprised that wasn't an error, maybe there's some......  default?  Maybe it does /path:/path by default?  o_O  
[19:12:13] <Khaytsus> I've been doing podman/pods recently so haven't messed with a Docker compose in a few years
[19:13:42] <Czernobog> I have no idea the logs doesn't sjoe anything wrong. The only wrong happens is when I reboot lol
[19:15:14] <Khaytsus> Well, hopefully that was the issue.  Perhaps znc was writing to /config but your volume wasn't /config, etc
[19:15:23] <Khaytsus> So it was writing to ram effectively
