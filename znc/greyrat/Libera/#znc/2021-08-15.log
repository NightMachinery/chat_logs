[04:12:05] <DoctorD90> DarthGandalf, hello and excuse me for the ping. Im updating and finalizing my own PKI infrastructure before play with the ZNC certs. From my current setup on this machine I have 1 cert for each ZNC network profile I have to connect (all certs are the same). Is it correct that there is a plugin/module to allow the client-znc connection/authentication via certificate? Cause from at first look, the znc.pem and the certs on my laptop are different.

[18:35:58] <JAVA_THE_HUT> you might be looking in network
[18:37:00] <JAVA_THE_HUT> actually does it show up in /msg *status ListMods
[18:37:37] <oneofvalts> they it does, and yes i just saw them on global settings.
[18:37:50] <oneofvalts> *yes it...
[18:38:45] <oneofvalts> how do i add the module for a specific network though? it doesn't show up in network plugins list.
[18:38:50] <oneofvalts> in webadmin.
[18:39:18] <JAVA_THE_HUT> playback works globally
[18:39:27] <oneofvalts> i can load them manually, but i want it to load automatically.
[18:39:30] <oneofvalts> hmm.
[18:39:41] <JAVA_THE_HUT> well once you load it, it will load again on restart
[18:39:45] <JAVA_THE_HUT> it persists
[18:39:54] <JAVA_THE_HUT> in webmin, is it checked under global?
[18:40:03] <oneofvalts> yes it is.
[18:40:09] <JAVA_THE_HUT> yeah it's all setup
[18:40:14] <JAVA_THE_HUT> that's all you need to do :)
[18:40:23] <oneofvalts> nice.
[18:40:32] <JAVA_THE_HUT> does your IRC client support playback though?
[18:40:54] <oneofvalts> it's weechat and i have to look it up on internet, i don't know if it does.
[18:41:01] <JAVA_THE_HUT> yeah weechat does
[18:41:57] <JAVA_THE_HUT> actually I'm not 100% sure
[18:42:04] <JAVA_THE_HUT> maybe ask #weechat
[18:42:05] <oneofvalts> one more question: how exactly do i use "/znc *playback PLAY <buffer(s)> [from] [to]" command? what to write for from and to?
[18:42:20] <JAVA_THE_HUT> usually your client does that automagically
[18:42:29] <JAVA_THE_HUT> so you just get the playback you missed
[18:42:34] <JAVA_THE_HUT> (if your client supports it)
[18:43:04] <oneofvalts> uh huh
[18:43:23] <oneofvalts> but when i run this command, it should actually give me something, right?
[18:43:27] <JAVA_THE_HUT> yeah
[18:44:04] <JAVA_THE_HUT> from and to are UNIX time iirc
[18:44:17] <JAVA_THE_HUT> i.e. seconds since 1 January 1970
[18:44:18] <oneofvalts> when i run it, i don't get any response at all, no change it any windows.
[18:44:30] <JAVA_THE_HUT> is there anything in the playback buffer
[18:45:30] <JAVA_THE_HUT> this is meant to be done by the client... really don't think you will be calculating UNIX time manually
[18:45:51] <oneofvalts> gotcha
[18:46:07] <oneofvalts> this is hard to test :)
[18:46:29] <oneofvalts> i'm not really sure if it works now :)
[18:47:15] <oneofvalts> i don't want to see a few lines of playback when i launch weechat again tomorrow.
[18:47:30] <oneofvalts> i want to see the whole thing.
[18:51:22] <JAVA_THE_HUT> are you running weechat locally or on a VPS ?
[18:51:51] <JAVA_THE_HUT> most people run weechat on a server in screen or some such
[18:52:07] <oneofvalts> i run weechat locally, znc is in my server.
[18:52:28] <JAVA_THE_HUT> ahhh
[18:52:38] <JAVA_THE_HUT> I'm not sure if weechat actually supports playback module, tbh
[18:52:43] <JAVA_THE_HUT> Textual does
[18:52:45] <JAVA_THE_HUT> I am using Textual 7.2.1 (Build 210711.11) (Standalone Version) as a universal binary on an Intel Mac.
[18:53:49] <oneofvalts> if people run weechat on a server in screen, why would they need playback, it runs always anyways.
[18:53:53] <oneofvalts> i don't get it.
[18:55:15] <oneofvalts> noted, will take a look at textual.
[18:57:16] <JAVA_THE_HUT> they don't use playback in that situation
[18:57:26] <JAVA_THE_HUT> weechat on the server is basically the bouncer
[18:57:30] <JAVA_THE_HUT> they don't use znc either
