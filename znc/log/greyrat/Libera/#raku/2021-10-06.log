[00:51:54] <MasterDuke> there are still some bugs and/or not yet implemented features in unsigned or smaller-than-64-bit natives

[00:52:46] <bisectable6> Guest12, ¦6c (58 commits): «True␤»
[00:52:47] <bisectable6> Guest12, Nothing to bisect!
[00:53:28] <Guest12> MasterDuke: Thanks. Does it make sense for the docs to reflect (very long-standing and basic) bugs?
[00:54:30] <MasterDuke> there's been debate about that. should they reflect the limitations of a particular implementation? or the intentions of the language?
[00:54:57] <Guest12> Ah. "NOTE: at the time of this writing (2018.05), certain implementations (such as Rakudo)
[00:55:15] <Guest12> offer somewhat spotty details on native types, such as whether int64 is available
[00:55:23] <Guest12> and is of 64-bit size on 32-bit machines, and how to detect when your program is running on such hardware."
[00:56:33] <MasterDuke> yes. currently i would recommend only using the signed, 64-bit versions with rakudo, i believe those work fine
[00:56:41] <Guest12> I missed that note. (I searched for "bug" and "known")
[00:57:20] <Guest12> MasterDuke: Thanks. Makes sense.

[18:11:03] <lizmat> m: sub infix:<^>(\a,\b) is equiv(&infix:<**>) { "foo" }; say 4 ^ 5

[18:11:34] <Petr> Nice day )) Anybody can help me? Can i convert html to docx &
[18:11:36] <lizmat> immediate: the problem is that your candidate did not have 2 params
[18:12:08] <immediate> lizmat: didn't it? With $^a and $^b?
[18:12:31] <immediate> and it gave a result 8000 back as (5 * 4) ^ 3
[18:13:09] <Petr> I cant find any solution for this...
[18:14:12] <[Coke]> Petr: I don't think raku has any interop with the latest office standard. You might find a solution in perl (that you could then use from Raku)
[18:14:28] <[Coke]> If it's a one off.. you should be able to cut and paste it in.)
[18:15:16] <Petr> What about ODT?
[18:15:43] <MasterDuke> i think tbrowder was working on some modules for office docs
[18:16:35] <MasterDuke> and i think jnthn made a module to work with xls
[18:17:08] <lizmat> immediate: ah, yes...  :-)
[18:17:43] <lizmat> m: sub infix:<^> is equiv(&infix:<**>) { $^a, $^b; "foo" }; say 4^5
[18:17:43] <camelia> rakudo-moar 569f90eae: OUTPUT: «foo␤»
[18:18:02] <lizmat> so, I'm not sure why that didn't work for you, immediate 
[18:18:06] <[Coke]> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4226095/html-to-doc-converter-in-python/4227062#4227062 - a python example of using the word itself to do the conversion.
[18:18:07] <Petr> thanks
[18:18:42] <lizmat> aaah... it's about precedence
[18:18:51] * lizmat goes back to working on the weekly  :-)
[18:19:17] <Petr> i hate python )))
[18:20:36] <Petr> what about jvm support&
[18:21:30] <lizmat> there is a JVM backend, but it misses some features
[18:21:33] <lizmat> most notably NFG

[18:52:26] <ggoebel> is this still a good place to ask questions about using comma?
[18:55:21] <immediate> thanks liz\mat
[18:56:15] <sena_kun> ggoebel, two its devs are currently here, so yes, pretty much.

[19:50:23] <Tirifto> Hello! Is there a way to re-dispatch a method call to a role that the given class does? The method resolution order only includes parent classes, but not roles, so stuff like ‘callsame’ doesn’t work. Is anything like it available for roles, too?
[19:51:21] <Tirifto> (I guess I could inherit from the role instead, but that feels a bit hacky.)
[19:51:52] <MasterDuke> maybe explicitly calling `RoleName::method-name()`
[19:54:39] <Tirifto> Ohh, ‘::’, I didn’t realise that was a thing that would work here!
[19:58:06] <Tirifto> Or maybe it wouldn’t. :P | Could not find symbol '&remove' in 'Container'
