[05:26:13] <monoxane> the only apple tax i validly agree with is the price of phones holy fuck why are they so expensive
[05:26:24] <sd> 02<H‚Äãunterkll> both our mac and PC configs are about $2k all said and done and about equal spec for spec

[05:26:55] <PublicWiFi> not only that
[05:26:57] <sd> 02<H‚Äãunterkll> that's true, but when you're buying 8 and 16GB machines

[05:27:01] <PublicWiFi> LOL
[05:27:02] <monoxane> like im not going to not buy one because of it but i dont like dropping 1k+ on a phone every 3ish years, even if its still around $1 a day effective

[05:27:14] <sd> 02<H‚Äãunterkll> though, last time i spec'd out a 32GB MBP it was cheaper than the latitude i was looking at

[05:27:22] <sd> 02<H‚Äãunterkll> lol
[05:27:42] <Sousapro> Yeah it's always about paying attention but once you get out of consumer prices they were always pretty competitive 
[05:28:02] <Sousapro> Now they're generally competitive because they save so much on cpu/gpu
[05:28:11] <sd> 02<H‚Äãunterkll> plus our service agreement makes the cost per-unit cheaper in the end once we get that kicked into gear for x86 kit
[05:28:24] <monoxane> im currently on my work m1 mbp and it performs significantly better than an equal priced latitude my coworker has for what we use it for (mostly development)
[05:28:29] <sd> 02<H‚Äãunterkll> like, we just buy units, and they covered, no figuring that shit out, no addon shit, etc
[05:28:43] <sd> 02<H‚Äãunterkll> yea, i'm waiting for the big boy ram option ones of those
[05:28:53] <monoxane> even running docker builds through a rosetta2 docker desktop vm is still faster

[10:17:56] <xe0n> DingDong: the first thing to do is make a list of the roadblocks you're facing, chances are many of them can be bundled together to solve...or you solve them each at a time...which creates a complete solution
[10:18:21] <xe0n> i.e. pc imaging = 1 problem. user account creation = 1 problem. assigning licenses = 1 problem
[10:18:32] <xe0n> three problems there that can be their own project, and can be solved
[10:18:45] <xe0n> its just a  matter of research, understanding your requirements, having the rest of your team\management on board
[10:18:55] <xe0n> and then also the resources (i.e infrastructure) to do the things

[10:54:39] <xe0n> jet direct!
[10:54:42] <JollyRgrs> i mean... that's... vague?
[10:54:56] <sideup66> yes, im curious, as i found a cheap one on buy/sell (local), trying to figure out if its part of their golden era, or if junk
[10:54:59] <sideup66> its a 4350tn
[10:55:05] <JollyRgrs> had an LJ2100 that worked for 15-20 yrs before my dad finally gave it up
[10:55:05] <xe0n> haha laserjet4
[10:55:07] <catbeard> HP = junk
[10:55:12] <catbeard> ez
[10:55:14] <xe0n> oh please laserjet4s are tank
[10:55:16] <xe0n> lol
[10:55:19] <xe0n> they've been around forever
[10:55:25] <xe0n> <waits for you know who to chime in>
[10:55:25] <sideup66> catbeard: older ones though? i thought i heard the older ones were tanks
[10:55:27] <sd> 02<S‚Äãir Sceptalot> so has herpes
[10:55:35] <JollyRgrs> iirc 4350 is what we had a LOT of at the hospital (Where ton of printing was done)
[10:55:43] <JollyRgrs> tanks, but also sucks energy
[10:55:49] <JollyRgrs> so depends on electric bills and stuff, too
[10:55:54] <xe0n> yeah but it'll also fold your washing if you get the addon
[10:55:58] <JollyRgrs> and print speeds may not be as fast
[10:56:01] <JollyRgrs> xe0n++
[10:56:12] <catbeard> not as if someone's life depended on a printer
[10:56:22] <Kiernian> *twitch* someone said jet direct
[10:56:25] <catbeard> if that's the case, whoa man you're in the wrong place
[10:56:44] <catbeard> might as well have them print your last will and testament
[10:57:12] <sideup66> well in my apartment i can use a printer, wont be used much honestly
[10:57:14] <JollyRgrs> they finally moved off of dot matrix to laser printers for Rx... but not when I first started in like... 2012ish?
[10:57:27] <JollyRgrs> sideup66: a laser printer for your apartment?
[10:57:28] <xe0n> need that computer paper yo
[10:57:31] <catbeard> DOT!   DOT MATRIX!!!!!
[10:57:43] <JollyRgrs> dude, you can find cheap brother laser printers with ethernet for like $100 or less
[10:57:45] <xe0n> doo dooo doo dooooooot doo doo
[10:57:48] <catbeard> everybody now, starting on your left foot
[10:57:54] <catbeard> DADDY THATS YOUR RIGHT FOOT
[10:57:58] <catbeard> it's too late!
[10:57:59] <JollyRgrs> i snagged one that was samsung for like $50, cheaper to buy a new printer than a new toner cart
[10:58:05] <xe0n> +++
[10:58:13] <xe0n> officeworks here like 13-14 years ago had $20 printers
[10:58:26] <xe0n> cheaper to buy a new printer with half an ink cartridge than buy a full ink
[10:58:26] <sideup66> JollyRgrs: not a printer id use daily, but i mean a personal pritner to use for the occasional time i need to print something
[10:58:33] <JollyRgrs> sideup66: exactly
[10:58:34] <xe0n> should be fine
[10:58:41] <xe0n> find some toner, good to go
[10:58:43] <JollyRgrs> i have 2 kids in school and a wife... sometimes we print
[10:58:43] <sideup66> and im debating the laserjet im looking at because well, it will be a tank because hp laserjet
[10:58:50] <JollyRgrs> but i don't need a printing press in my office
[10:59:04] <JollyRgrs> you are looking at tanks, but just need a geo metro dude
[10:59:08] <JollyRgrs> don't think too hard about it
[10:59:17] <sideup66> i know, that thing is total overkill
[10:59:20] <sideup66> but 25 bucks is 25 bucks
[10:59:32] <xe0n> hey if its free
[10:59:39] <Kiernian> and depending on the model of laserjet you can use PJL over telnet to set the rdymsg to fun things like "INSERT COIN" "ADD WHITE INK" and "xe0n ate mice"
[10:59:47] <JollyRgrs> sideup66: but the size of that thing
[10:59:54] <sideup66> heheh

[11:01:06] <sideup66> i was just looking because well old laserjets are industrial grade and this is stupid cheap, i was curious if this is from a crappy era or not
[11:01:14] <xe0n> its $25
[11:01:17] <xe0n> buy it, and if it sucks, smash it
[11:01:20] <xe0n> there's your $25 worth

[17:30:10] <corn266> it's 9am now and i just gotta check on a prgram that ran over the weekend and update the code
[17:34:37] <JollyRgrs> mistiry: 100% on those stupid pop-ups... even worse is now EVERY SITE has to take up space at the bottom for the GDRP/california/whatever else privacy laws about cookies
[17:36:05] <vinrock> man ive unsunsbscribed from so many services becaue of that california law
[17:36:16] <vinrock> i get a message saying i can tel them not to sell my shit ONLY if i live in cali
[17:36:18] <vinrock> motherfucker what
[17:36:43] <Oliber> quite a few sites feel like they default to no tracking, if you customise/save changes
[17:36:52] <Activ8> I use a browser extension called "I don't care about cookies"
[17:37:00] <Activ8> it automatically removes them
[17:37:23] <Activ8> doesn't detect some trackers but on a whole it does remove the majority

[17:46:30] <PublicWiFi> you're welcome lol
[17:46:44] <haise01> I'm finally spinning up Matrix instance in my lab
[17:47:04] <haise01> yesterday I fought with Grafana, Alertmanager and Prometheus but it was worth it
[17:47:49] <MoonBounce> do most people just modify scripts they find online?
[17:47:58] <MoonBounce> i hate writing scripts from scratch
[17:47:59] <mistiry> had a logitech g502 hero, not even 2 months old and the scrollwheel died. got replacement yesterday, hooked it up today. it's either a refurb or they changed what swithces they use, new old is so much louder and at _least_ 3x the actuation force to depress the buttons. at least the top buttons, side buttons feel the exact same.
[17:48:02] <sd> 08<b‚Äãdenlinger> I have a love/hate relationship with Prometheus
[17:48:12] <mistiry> i write most of my scripts from scratch
[17:48:34] <mistiry> even im borrowing code its not usually an entire script
[17:48:34] <MoonBounce> everytime i work on a script and show it to my manager he always asks me if i wrote it from scratch and i feel kinda dumb when i say no lol
[17:48:58] <MoonBounce> i mean if it gets the problem fixed thats all that matters i guess
[17:49:03] <Joe-Developer> depends
[17:49:12] <haise01> MoonBounce: I write most of mine from scratch 
[17:49:17] <Joe-Developer> if it's something really accustom to your workplace then from scratch
[17:49:21] <MoonBounce> yeah im not at that level tbh
[17:49:24] <Joe-Developer> but if it's something someone else has done before and shared
[17:49:27] <MoonBounce> i need something to work off of usually
[17:49:34] <Joe-Developer> then taking from the internet makes life easier
[17:49:58] <sd> 13<C‚Äãolour> I mean it doesn't matter if you wrote it from scratch haha
[17:50:03] <Joe-Developer> gotta think things like librarys etc. exist for code etc. because people have already made something work and tested it, so *you* don't have to
[17:50:08] <mistiry> as long as you understand what the script is doing
[17:50:21] <sd> 13<C‚Äãolour> If I copy paste powershell lines from Microsoft.com does that count as scratch or copied from the internet.
[17:50:24] <MoonBounce> yeah, usually what I do is I find some script online that kinda/pretty much does what we want to do
[17:50:32] <MoonBounce> i clean it up, make it work specifically for our enviroment 
[17:50:34] <mistiry> you go copypasta some random script without understanding what its doing, you can have unintended consequences

[18:11:32] <PublicWiFi> okay dumb question.. im using k8s with a docker driver. Does this make k8s a sort of "hypervisor" for containers?
[18:11:37] <PublicWiFi> though they all share the kernel right?
[18:11:53] <PublicWiFi> so it doesn't have to actually work on resource management? is that all handled in the kernel?
[18:12:02] <JollyRgrs> I wouldn't go down the hole of trying to think of it like a hypervisor
[18:12:15] <PublicWiFi> yeah its hard to split my brain from that idea I think
[18:13:41] <estranger> what is "it" and which resources... containers share a kernel but k8s manages resources to each pod/container
[18:13:47] <estranger> it has its own scheduler
