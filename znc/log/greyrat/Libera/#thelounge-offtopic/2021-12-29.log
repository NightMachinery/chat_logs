[03:19:47] <hbag> would be nice if there was an option to disable notifications on other devices while one device is being used
[03:19:55] <hbag> like i keep getting phone notifications for thelounge while im using it on my pc
[03:21:14] <bookworm> define being used... screen open? client has focus? You're actually typing?
[03:21:28] <bookworm> not as easy as it sounds I'm afraid
[03:22:00] <hbag> "screen open" would work for me
[03:22:28] <hbag> idk, discord seems to pull it off pretty well but i got no idea how they do it
[03:22:29] <bookworm> except not for people who don't shut down devices and just keep the browser open
[03:23:24] <hbag> i guess define being used as "last typed in/posted from"
[03:23:59] <bookworm> people still move between devices and not closing the window
[03:24:05] <bookworm> are not*
[03:24:09] <hbag> true
[03:24:29] <bookworm> playing the devil's advocate btw, I see what you mean
[03:24:37] <hbag> if i can figure out discord's algorithm for deciding which device to ping, that'd probably work
[03:24:37] <bookworm> but it really isn't simple
[03:24:40] <hbag> since they pull it off pretty well
[03:24:59] <xnaas> There's already logic for detecting no active sessions and marking yourself afk in irc
[03:25:04] <xnaas> in thelounge
[03:25:32] <xnaas> surely an off-shoot of that same logic to something similar would be able to yield the desired result, no?
[03:25:32] <bookworm> that assumes open clients to always be connected and "active" iirc
[03:25:39] <hbag> yeah#
[03:25:51] <bookworm> which is kina broken for the same reason mentioned above
[03:26:36] <bookworm> Telegram does it rather neat, it just delays the notification by X and dismisses the notification as soon as any client read the message
[03:26:36] <xnaas> obviously the solution is to buy an iphone and have 0 push notifications, hbag
[03:26:38] <xnaas> ðŸ¤ª
[03:26:48] <xnaas> B A I T
[03:26:50] <hbag> i like having push notifications on my phone though
[03:26:54] <hbag> when im not at home
[03:27:03] <xnaas> (I'm mostly just trolling mr. worm)
[03:27:05] <bookworm> if you don't read it within X amount of time it emits it for all devices
[03:27:25] <bookworm> we're in -ot I don't care if you're trolling
[03:27:45] <hbag> bookworm: that telegram thing could work tbh
[03:27:51] <bookworm> yeah
[03:28:13] <hbag> and then it marks the client that does eventually read it as the "active" one?
[03:28:21] <bookworm> also avoids any kind of passive guessing
[03:29:08] <bookworm> It doesn't have a concept of active or not, you either read the message in time (meaning no push) or you didn't (meaning emit the push to all devices)
[03:29:28] <hbag> yeah but how does it decide which gets the first notif?
[03:29:47] <bookworm> that I don't know
[03:30:01] <bookworm> guess last active then you're probably right
[03:31:26] <bookworm> native applications have 8t a tad easier as they can actually query the WM whether they are in focus or not... iirc the browser nerf that capability quite much due to privacy concerns
[03:31:57] <bookworm> which makes sense for web pages, not so much for applications
[03:35:10] <MaxLeiter> huh, im kind of amazed ðŸ¤ª works 
[03:35:18] <bookworm> react?

[03:36:02] <bookworm> oh, italic smileys
[03:36:04] <MaxLeiter> oh, guess you wouldnt notice :P
[03:36:07] <bookworm> no

[03:36:54] <MaxLeiter> havent worked on react in a bit bc i dont like the socket handling 
[03:37:08] <MaxLeiter> if i find a nice way to do it ill work on it some more ðŸ¤·
[03:37:24] * bookworm hovers over the +c button
[03:38:25] <MaxLeiter> +c?
[03:38:36] <bookworm> disable control chars
[03:38:43] <bookworm> aand colours
[03:38:58] <bookworm> win win
[03:39:05] <MaxLeiter> self plug but i did *just* push https://maxleiter.com/blog/useMoustrap which i used for react lounge 
[03:41:35] <bookworm> onto my RSS feed you go, plug successful ;P
[03:41:50] <MaxLeiter> ah damn, of course I mispelled mousetrap in the slug
[03:41:58] <MaxLeiter> eh, im sorry for my writing skills/effort
[03:42:27] <bookworm> but *I* get stabbed at for missing stuff in a commit message
[03:43:12] <MaxLeiter> wasnt meant to be a stab :D 
[03:43:21] <bookworm> I know, just kidding
[03:46:34] <bookworm> re your run-pr.sh post, you do know that you can tell git to just fetch all GH PRs on every fetch right? No need to do this one by one
[03:46:53] <bookworm> as in, just add the PR ref namespace to the refspec

[03:51:51] <xnaas> Can't see italic emojis on iOS of course, but that shouldn't really come as a shocker to anyone. :P
[03:54:18] <MaxLeiter> bookworm: we have a lot of them 
[03:54:34] <bookworm> yes
[03:54:56] <MaxLeiter> ive previously done https://gist.github.com/piscisaureus/3342247
[03:55:11] <bookworm> luckily that only matters when you first fetch
[03:55:50] <MaxLeiter> this is also portable, I can clone the repo and do it 
[03:55:55] <MaxLeiter> which is a point i left out of the post 
[03:56:09] <MaxLeiter> (its most useful for me so I can run PRs on my vps's)
[03:56:19] <bookworm> don't quite understand what you mean
[03:56:21] <MaxLeiter> git clone && ./scripts/run_pr
[03:56:27] <bookworm> ah, that
[03:56:38] <bookworm> y
[03:56:54] <bookworm> I just push to my fork and clone from there
[03:57:13] <MaxLeiter> ðŸ¤·
[03:57:52] <bookworm> ah, nevermind the y that was me fat fingering, not sms speak
[03:59:32] <MaxLeiter> ah
[05:40:25] <bookworm> what kills me in JS land is that you can't possibly reason about algorithmic complexity like at all. The freaking language changes an Array which should have a certain type of behavior to a hashmap under you, which has a completely different behavior
[05:41:55] <bookworm> problem being that you don't know if or when that flip happens, meaning your perfectly working code can suddenly degrade without you knowing why that is
[05:42:22] <bookworm> who the hell came up with that idea?
[06:14:53] <MaxLeiter> I feel like with any language youd need to read the docs or source to determine complexity in some cases (maybe you cant make as any assumptions in js, but assumptions in any language can be dangerous) 
[06:15:03] <MaxLeiter> as many*
[06:15:30] <MaxLeiter> Assumptions regarding implementations, to be clear
