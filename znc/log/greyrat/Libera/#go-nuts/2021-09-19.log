[02:05:00] <A_Dragon> or, the correct answer, use a struct
[02:05:16] <A_Dragon> in fact, for that, you must use a struct
[02:06:23] <fizzie> You *can* have a `map[string]interface{}` to represent that same data, but you shouldn't.

[02:21:01] <fizzie> Yeah. (It's not standard terminology or anything, hence the quotes.)
[02:21:53] <b0nn> Huh, what's wrong with a nested struct?

[02:27:53] <fizzie> A few reasons. It won't catch any errors you might make with the keys, you have to type-assert all the values you pull out from it to the types you "know" them to be (and panic if you get it wrong), tools won't know what fields there are and can't help you write code, and so on.

[02:32:17] <someuser> i see what you mean, there has been few times were i expect a json response and i decode the res.Body to some map, i always choose the type to be map[string]interface{}, but then the type assertion can be tricky with it's syntax
[02:32:21] *** Joins: ninjin (~ninjin@user/ninjin)
[02:33:30] <someuser> is there a way to map the response type to the correct one ? i can make var responseMap map[string]string and then json.NewDecoder(req.Body).Decode(&responseMap)
[02:33:36] <someuser> but is this the right way of doing it ?
[02:34:53] <fizzie> You can make `var response StructTypeRepresentingTheResponse` as well, and decode straight into it.
[02:35:40] <fizzie> A `map[string]string` will only be correct if the response is really a "flat" JSON object where all the values are strings.
[02:37:06] <fizzie> (Yes, you'd have to declare the `StructTypeRepresentingTheResponse`, but you implicitly have to list the keys and their types anyway when making use of them, a struct type just puts them all nicely together.)
[02:38:54] <someuser> okay that is also something i should be practicing, but i assume that's the case when I'm aware of the response and it's not some huge one that I only need tiny parts of it
[02:38:59] <someuser> thank you :)

[15:04:45] <SoF> could someone explain to me how licenses work with go modules/requirements? I.e. can my MIT-licensed project use a GPL-licensed dependency in go.mod?
[15:05:06] <SoF> I think yes, because I don't actually redistribute the files? is that how that works?
[15:08:36] <bomb> "GPL-licensed dependency" gives me goosebumps already
[15:09:18] <bomb> it's contagious, you wouldn't want to touch it.
[15:09:53] *** Joins: sdfgsdfg (~sdfgsdfg@user/sdfgsdfg)
[15:26:48] <SoF> so just having a link in my go.mod means I must release the source code of my project as AGPL as well?
[15:28:46] <Sam> If you just distribute source it's fine to link to a GPL project, if you distribute a binary then you're also distributing that GPL project, so then you'd have to change your thing to be GPL. I am not a lawyer though.
[15:29:14] <SoF> Sam: thank you!
[15:30:07] <ikke> There is a lot of FUD around GPL
[15:32:15] <bomb> rightfully
[15:33:01] <SoF> Sam: is the reason behind that discrepancy (just source code can be MIT, binary must be GPL), that with source code I can inspect and see that it uses some GPL licensed code, but if it was a binary I couldn't (not always, anyway)?
[15:33:04] <Sam> I'm with the other person that replied, I'd avoid it if at all possible. It will limit what you can do with your own code in the future if you ever need to vendor things or distribute a binary.
[15:33:45] <Sam> SoF: no, it's just about distribution. If you're just distributing source code you're only distributing a link to the GPL project. If you're distributing a binary their code is actually built in object form and included so you're distributing it.
[15:34:21] <SoF> how about "vendor things" - is it fine to vendor GPL source in my MIT source if I just distribute the source?
[15:34:35] <Sam> No, vendoring is also distributing the GPL code and you'd need to relicense your stuff most likely
[15:35:13] <SoF> I see
[15:35:20] <bomb> which GPL library you wanted to use, by the way? maybe we can find a non-GPL alternative
[15:35:40] <SoF> https://github.com/juruen/rmapi AGPL
[15:36:05] <SoF> I mostly asked because I found a popular repo that vendors rmapi's source but is licensed as MIT
[15:36:12] <SoF> so that is a license violation, correct?
[15:36:18] <SoF> https://github.com/jessfraz/morningpaper2remarkable/tree/master/vendor/github.com/juruen/rmapi
[15:36:29] <Sam> oooh, that's not GPL, that's AGPL. That's even stricter IIRC
[15:36:40] <SoF> yeah, it is from what I've heard
[15:37:11] <Sam> I would assume that's a license violation, but I am not a lawyer. And it only matters if the other author decides to care and file a complaint.
[15:37:30] <SoF> I see, thank you :)

[15:53:04] <bomb> if it wasn't compatible, you wouldn't legally mix the two
[15:53:15] <Sam> It also means you can link to the GPL project from your MIT project, but as soon as you build a binary the work as a whole must use the GPL terms, IIRC

[15:53:47] <SoF> re: additional restrictions
[15:54:52] <Sam> All of this is exactly why you shouldn't use the GPL though. Normal people can't use them without confusing themselves and screwing up and risking being sued :) I mean, hopefully a good project maintainer wouldn't sue someone acting in good faith, the point is to just stop giant companies from abusing your work, but it opens you up to that. There's got to be a better way to stop big companies while not hurtin

[20:00:23] <SoF> different question - would it be acceptable to have both a GPLv3 licensed version and a MIT licensed version of my project at the same time? that way I could use the GPLv3 licensed version to distribute a binary, but users could still use parts of my own code under MIT
[20:00:46] <SoF> (^still in the context of having a GPLv3 licensed dependency)
[20:00:53] <ikke> yes, mutlilicensing is a thing
[20:01:14] <ikke> But, having it just as MIT means they can still combine it with GPL code
[20:01:18] <seebs> I'm not a lawyer. There's a lot of people associated with FSF who will be very aggressive about suggesting that you can never use other licenses for your code if it's been shipped with GPL code or whatever, or even if it just *relies* on GPL code.

[20:01:49] <seebs> The example they used to give was a program which can be built to use readline, and their claim was that since readline was GPL, the code can't run without a GPLd thing, therefore has to be GPL also.
[20:01:55] <SoF> ikke: do you have any examples of such multilicensed projects I could look at?
[20:02:01] <seebs> But actually there's a non-GPL API-compatible readline that someone posted to usenet so hah.
[20:02:06] <Sam> Yah, also not a lawyer but that is just wrong.
[20:02:14] <Sam> You can license code even if it doesn't work, it's still your code.
[20:02:32] <seebs> Some companies make commercial products available to other people as GPL, and *also* as their own proprietary binaries, for example.
[20:02:52] <Sam> I wonder if the Oracle v Google case influences this. Maybe they could argue that the API you use is GPL or something. I hope not, but it sounds like something the FSF would do.
[20:02:59] *** Joins: fikran (~fikran@user/fikran)
[20:03:20] <Sam> (in the U.S. anyways, not that that controls anywhere else)
[20:03:26] <SoF> seebs: how does that company example work, the one with one GPL version and one proprietary binary version?
[20:03:56] <seebs> I mean, if I understand it correctly (again, not a lawyer), it works because it's their code and they don't need a license to do anything they want with it.
[20:04:22] <seebs> So they can say "here are terms under which *you* are allowed to use this code", but also *they* can do anything they want with it. Such as building binaries, which they also own, and which they can give to people under any terms they want.
[20:04:33] <SoF> ah my bad, I thought this was in the context of them using a third-party, GPL library
[20:04:43] <SoF> but the way you explained it makes sense.
[20:05:24] <seebs> Yeah. As long as it's their own code, they can make up a new license every time they ship it or something.
[20:05:44] <ikke> It's different when they accept contributions from others though
[20:05:53] <seebs> My favorite recently-seen licenses are (1) a license that does not give you permission to use the code, at all, for any reason or in any way, used on a Go monkeypatching library (and quite reasonably so), and (2) a license the terms of which are "Be gay. Do crimes."
[20:05:57] <ikke> So that's usually why there are multiple licenses

[20:11:09] <seebs> to clarify those licenses were on different projects
[20:11:25] <seebs> and i think the intent of the "be gay. do crimes." license is that most of the writer's friends are already in compliance one way or another. :P
