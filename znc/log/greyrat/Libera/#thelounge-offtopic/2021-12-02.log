[02:42:04] <johncs> i mostly build with react. i feel like it's not hugely different from what I've experienced hacking on the lounge.
[02:42:38] <johncs> the whole hook api was a pretty wild new direction for react, but i've been digging it. definitely a harder thing to wrap your head around though than their class API.
[02:43:41] <MaxLeiter> yeah I very much like react with hooks and functional components
[02:43:56] <MaxLeiter> vue 3 can get a lot closer to it
[02:44:37] <johncs> legit, i'll be excited if we upgrade the lounge to it so i can get some experience with it
[02:46:16] <MaxLeiter> I wish we didnt have such a complicated build process. Vite would be a cool DX upgrade too
[02:47:59] <johncs> haha for sure. i've got so many bash scripts for shmeppy it's absurd... gotta optimize them too, my pre-commit git hook takes like a minute or so to run which is hella annoying
[02:48:16] <johncs> i don't do nearly enough "only look at the files that changed" things
[02:48:58] <johncs> i don't know how to avoid ending up with a complicated build process ðŸ˜­
[02:50:44] <MaxLeiter> yeah, https://github.com/thelounge/thelounge/blob/master/webpack.config.js kind of hurts to read sometimes 
[02:51:25] <MaxLeiter> removing index.html.tpl would be nice. everything templated should be exposed via API for other theoretical frontends

[11:05:31] <bookworm> nothing, absolutely nothing should be done in a pre-commit hook, damned I use commits to structure / checkpoint my work *I know* it's broken
[11:05:46] <bookworm> if you want to sanity check things, do it at the CI level
[11:06:09] <bookworm> or pre-receive if you want to annoy your devs, but pre-commit is the wrong place for absolutely everything
[11:07:10] <bookworm> in facty, can we get rid of husky? That thing spams emojy in my git workflow and needs to die :P
[11:07:43] <bookworm> well spammed*, marking my hook dir as immutable solved the issue for now
[12:26:27] <MaxLeiter> I think it increases likelihood of successful PRs from new contributors  
[12:26:35] <MaxLeiter> but i dont feel too strongly 
[12:26:40] <MaxLeiter> you can always just -n

[12:57:29] <bookworm> is that --ignore-scripts? That I cannot else sqlite3 is broken 
[12:57:47] <bookworm> as that actually does a sane thing in the installation hook

[12:58:47] <bookworm> or do you mean 8n git? Yeah, no. We shouldn't install scripts by default in my view. Rather we can provide an installation script for those who want it

[13:31:29] <MaxLeiter> Git commit -n wont run pre commit hooka
[13:47:08] <bookworm> yeah, but that's papering over the problem, not fixing the issue
[13:47:30] <bookworm> for successful PRs, the CI will do the exact same thing no?
[13:47:47] <bookworm> I mean the bot sends a nice email with the error so people can correct it
[13:48:19] <bookworm> that also meant that they didn't run the test framework, so there's that
[13:48:54] <bookworm> meaning the PR isn't exactly up to speed either way and they need to re-evaluate the workflow ;P
