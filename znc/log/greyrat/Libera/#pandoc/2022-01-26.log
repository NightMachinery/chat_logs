[00:03:18] <ede> ah, scss is also on the agenda
[00:04:09] <ede> how do you handle relative pathes to the css?i think i ran into some issue, though not sure right now what exactly it was

[00:55:59] <ede> any idea why the .deb binary is 10% bigger than the .tgz one?
[01:32:25] <jaawerth> well, in my case I use the xdg spec - or just pass a relative path, which should work? or you can use shellisms to resolve it into an absolute one - unless you mean "relative in the html output to where the css will be deployed" rather than using -s/--standalone or --self-contained
[01:33:58] <jaawerth> in which case there's various flags 'n things. for fancy logic you might want a filter
[02:22:48] <ede> i think i reconstructed the situation. i have 3 directories: css, md, html. md has subdirectories, html will mirror the structure after build. i had a script handling this, can't remember what it did.
[02:23:52] <ede> but probably it used find's results to dive into directories and create html files adding the relative path from the start dir to the html dir.
[02:24:53] <ede> hm, i'll have to try how images in the different source directories get included correctly and how i'd have to use the path to the css.

[02:50:04] <ede> using links in tables is really a pita. i tried with what i thought would work, but doesn't, that's [text]() and [text][], i think i may remember the 2nd one from some wiki.
[02:50:35] <ede> and when i add now links into the brackets the text becomes much wider, means i have to resize the whole table
[02:54:47] *** Joins: Xenguy (~Xenguy@user/xenguy)
[03:24:00] <ede> yeah. in the main dir i need ../css, below it ../../css etc. and probably a dozen ways to handle this. but definitely something for a script. would really be nice if pandoc would be able to handle such things.
[03:53:07] <jaawerth> ede: just keep a reference for whatever markdown flavor you're using, there aren't typically that many forms unless you're adding wacky extensions like mermaid flowchart syntax or w/e. if you use gfm you can just use the github reference :)
[03:56:29] <ede> usually i don't know what i need before i need it
[04:10:16] <ede> i don't get this https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7764.html#section-3
[04:10:22] <ede> same as the wikipedia article
[04:10:55] <ede> they use MMD and GFM (which are dialects of a language) together with Pandoc (which is a tool)
[04:11:18] <ede> that's like comparing html, xhtml, html5 and chrome.
[04:18:43] <jaawerth> half the point of using markdown is it doesn't take much to have everything though, cusotm extensions aside
[04:32:50] <ede> but things like lists in table cells, hmm...
[05:00:11] <jaawerth> ede: ohh LISTS in tables, not links? yeah that won't work - iirc gfm tables are inline elements only, block elements are a no-go. you'll need to use html (which you can do with gfm) for that
[05:02:08] <ede> jaawerth, right now it was links and the impossibility to do it nicely only with | tables. but reformating tables because of added text is a lot of work anyway.
[05:02:22] <jaawerth> links you can do, lists not so much
[05:03:13] <ede> i remember some wiki (no idea which one) able to handle lists in simple tables, iirc it needs some kind of linebreak marker between the list items
[06:10:12] <jaawerth> plenty can, just not gfm without resorting to html tables
