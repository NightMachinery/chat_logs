[00:17:38] <vdamewood> Uh, no.
[00:18:11] <vdamewood> There's a big push to make the HTML content of a page semantic, meaning the tags used reflect the nature of what they're being used for.
[00:18:13] *** Joins: Pickchea (~private@user/pickchea)
[00:19:00] <vdamewood> <table>s are meant for tabular data. <code> is used for actual programming code. <p> is used for paragraphs, and so on.
[00:19:36] <vdamewood> Sure you can use <blockquote> to 'indent' something, but that indentation means nothing to a screen reader, but a quotation still means something in that context.
[00:19:47] <oldlaptop> Part of the *reason* for this push is to make it easier to modify the page, by separating purely stylistic things from actual information (or at least that's the ideal), but it also is useful for user-agents, which can use that semantic information to help the user
[00:19:50] <vdamewood> I screen reader might read quotes in a slightly different tone.

[00:20:29] <diophantoz> but if it's in the css, the screen reader doesn't need to read it
[00:20:30] <oldlaptop> In theory, Firefox's "reader view" could use semantic markup to make its job easier - in practice it has to have all sorts of evil heuristics to deal with old pages, or pages written by people who don't care about semantics

[00:21:21] <oldlaptop> The screen reader can assume (or could, if people didn't misuse tables) that a table is a table, and not a hack to make the page look a certain way
[00:21:31] <vdamewood> Well, CSS comes in by giving hints to User-Agents on how to render the page for an appropriate medium.
[00:22:02] <vdamewood> For example, you can specify, with CSS, that the <nav> element shouldn't be printed, but should be displayed on screen.
[00:22:25] <vdamewood> And without CSS at all, a screen reader can skip nav entirely while reading the page to the user.
[00:22:32] <oldlaptop> None of this means css is actually a particularly good style-description language, or for that matter that html is a particularly good semantic markup language

[01:16:22] <pyzozord> oldlaptop: I don't think is any different than other programs. It just makes it more convenient to write different language in it. But same thing can be achieved with library of function, just (subjectively) uglier syntax

[01:21:07] <Guest8456> tho I think C/C++ are rather strong languages anyway, as in ones of the best you can choose nowadays as a general purpose ones
[01:22:23] <Guest8456> with the plus you can use some visual libraries with them
[01:23:09] <pyzozord> sure I have preferences and opinions too, but in the back on my mind ultimately, I have some distance to my views about languages
[01:23:44] <Guest8456> in the other hand, there are bad languages, I understand too
[01:24:09] <oldlaptop> rannnn8888: Generally one doesn't ask to ask, one just asks
[01:24:12] <MrMobius> pyzozord, you cant boild it all down to preferences. people write things in one language and when it's not fast enough they change algorithms and when it's still not fast enough they choose another language and get a dramatic speed increase (ie way less cycles)
[01:24:22] <MrMobius> that is not a benchmark. that is objectively faster and not preference
[01:24:23] <Guest8456> in example I don't like MS branch in general

[01:25:08] <pyzozord> MrMobius: but I also think the reality is too complex and we can't quantify it at the moment to make any conclusive statements
[01:25:29] <MrMobius> you can conclusively prove that something took less time than something else
[01:25:45] <pyzozord> yes but it doesn't matter
[01:25:47] <MrMobius> that doesnt have to be the same as saying it's always better no matter what. that's a reaosnable standard to hold anything to
[01:25:53] <pyzozord> because it's synthetic benchmark
[01:26:05] <MrMobius> it's not a synthetic benchmark if you're using it for a real task
[01:26:27] <pyzozord> thing is, in different language you might use something else
[01:26:28] <MrMobius> a benchmark is a placeholder to let you reason about what will probably happen in real life. if you go out in real life and actually do it, that's not a benchmark
[01:26:37] <pyzozord> or solve the problem from completely different perspective
[01:27:19] <MrMobius> anyway, not worth arguing about but you can quantify all kinds of things and measure all kinds of improvements

[11:31:23] <mrig> Wow, it is quite an intriguing thing to write with a new script, the density of the information in a given space is different, this changes the behaviour of the interaction between the brain the hand and the paper entirely.
[11:33:36] <pyzozord> yeah something werid happens when you actually use your hands to draw on paper, different section of your brain is activated or something
[11:34:12] <mrig> Seems to be quite apparent that the type of script that you use has a massive effect too.
[11:34:39] <mrig> Its data content, not sure what the metric for this would be in this instance.
[11:35:06] <mrig> Fascinating stuff though.
[11:35:10] <pyzozord> different scripts could very well have a lot of impact too

[11:36:02] <mrig> Oh they do, I was reading the other day how there is no dyslexic effect when writing with the Chinese dialects scripts.
[11:36:20] <pyzozord> huh, interesting
[11:37:05] <mrig> I am toying with devanagari at the moment, which is between Chinese and Latin in its construction, but has the added facet of being an alpha syllabary.

[11:37:24] *** Quits: ravan (~ravan@user/ravan) (Quit: Leaving)
[11:37:38] <mrig> well there are no peculiar rules that break otherwise regular patterns.
[11:37:40] <quazimod1> pyzozord: that's not bad. I am seriously contemplating running an s3 & redis machine in AWS to handle this for us
[11:37:56] <quazimod1> but then you start to do out of subnet traffic... ends up costing $
[11:38:24] <mrig> the way that this leads into regular expressions is very cool though.

[11:42:54] <pyzozord> what interests us is a curious thing on it's own. For me grammars and parsers are interesting but only as tools, so I'd call that a minor interest. You seem to be fascinated with the concept of language itself so that's a major interest

[11:43:44] <pyzozord> For me grammars and parsers are only a way to build a programming language. And my own programming language is only a tool to write games. The games are the final goal for me.
[11:44:31] <pyzozord> Or maybe not even games, more like, virtual worlds and and maybe even art in some sense
[11:45:01] <mrig> Oh I can understand your interest, I do have the same one too, but that is for a little later on to explore and visualise the data.
[11:45:38] <mrig> as a game would be really fun to do.
[11:46:28] <mrig> It's not so much the language though, that I see as something that emerges, it's the logic that really grabs my attention some how.
[11:47:20] <mrig> its like the flame underneath the pot of bubbling liquid, the language being the bubbles.
[11:47:54] <pyzozord> I see, yes that sounds like the scientific bend.

[11:51:31] <flaknet99> sadly gamedev has been over commercialized, language dev is a more artistic act now
[11:51:34] <pyzozord> I don't think making games is really like making toys. I mean a lot of it, is. But I think it's a an artistic medium as big or bigger than text, picture, movie.

[11:55:07] <nitrix> mrig, The "good practices" work fine when they can be isolated to some parts of the application, but games tend to have they sort of design problems decisions that just infects the whole codebase so, in my experience at least, it's futile to try to massage things neatly.

[12:04:55] <akronymus> nitrix It was more me wondering what the reason is that you can't do that.

[12:05:48] *** Quits: Buttercat (~Buttercat@user/buttercat) (Quit: Leaving.)
[12:06:04] <nitrix> GPUs are stateful. It's akind to concurrent programming, or networking. If you send it a message so that it enables blending, blending stays enabled until you turn that off.
[12:06:26] <nitrix> If you have code that relies on blending being on or off, then it has to request that too, even if the GPU already was in the good state.
[12:06:37] <akronymus> Oh gotcha.
[12:06:48] *** Quits: togusa (~togusa@user/togusa) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[12:06:57] <mrig> state machines are amazing.
[12:07:00] <nitrix> Turning it on/off is overhead, keeping track of whether it's on/off is overhead too, the only way is with invariants.
[12:07:18] <nitrix> The code just has to do the right sequence of steps, knowing in which state the GPU is.
[12:07:23] <akronymus> Polling the current state is overhead too

[12:10:56] <nitrix> Anyway, it's just one example. Lifetime for game objects is annoying too. If you allow objects to point at other objects and one of them disappear, then depending on the language, you either have memory access violations, or you're working with a stale object preventing the GC to collect it.
[12:11:53] <nitrix> And then maybe you incorrectly persist that if the change naively happens in a destructor, causing causality problems, duping in-game items, etc.

[12:13:25] <akronymus> Thats what a DB is for IMO
[12:13:47] <nitrix> You can't download the entire game's database to all the players.

[12:13:52] <akronymus> In memory
[12:14:10] *** ixokani is now known as swinnenb
[12:14:38] <mrig> when managing memory, search for a specific prefix, that sort of thing; Yes effectively using regular expressions to form sets, like a database.
[12:14:41] <nitrix> So clients only download the guild info of the players that are in that guild, but that information needs to be obtained before the player is rendered, otherwise you wont be able to draw a cute banner above their character in-game.
[12:15:21] <nitrix> You don't want to re-download the same guild info everytime for each player, lot of them share the same guild. When it's just a string it's simple, when it's more data it's complicated.

[12:46:36] <pyzozord> consulting for startups you mean?
[12:46:42] <pyzozord> mercenary: thanks!
[12:47:04] <nitrix> Not consulting, a full time employee at a startup. You meet one of the founders and join as a developer there.
[12:47:21] <pyzozord> oh, yeah I think I am more of a startup person for sure
[12:47:27] <pyzozord> been in few startups and it was fun
[12:47:33] <arahael> I'd not want to do consulting unless I was very sure of my funding.
[12:48:22] <mrig> I think consulting could be the term used to describe someone who is so successful that they can pick and choose from the people who come to them offering work.
[12:48:31] <mrig> Not many people are that fortunate.

[12:49:24] <mrig> else their domain is so specific, and they so learned in it, that options for people who require the specific abilities are greatly reduced.
[12:49:45] <mrig> Ultimately having the same result.
[12:49:51] <mercenary> mrig: first rule of consulting: you don't get projects by advertising. You get them by knowing someone who knows someone who needs something done
[12:50:11] <nitrix> Yeah or extremely specific domain knowledge, might even be a former employee that worked on an old system no one understands anymore that got temporary re-hired to tweak it.
[12:51:23] <mercenary> Sometimes there's money to be made on migrations from an old system you know to something new
[12:51:55] <nitrix> Short contracts stresses me out. I need to know that as long as I do good and continue doing good, my income is safe.
[12:52:16] <xeno> mercenary: yeah, one of the reasons I don't wanna do consulting; the main requirement is not competence but being a social butterfly that knows everyone and their wives and dogs and all their wedding guests, that you impress in a suit and that you do what they want with a smile even if it's the wrong thing to do - especially if it's the wrong and short term thing to do 
[12:53:48] <mercenary> xeno: he that pays the piper, calls the tune. Even if the tune sounds horrible
[12:54:12] <mrig> mercenary: interesting thought, yep who and why some are successful is really all about the network, I suppose.
[12:54:13] <pyzozord> if consultancy is dependend on networking that I will probably not succeed
[12:54:22] <pyzozord> I mostly left burnt bridges behind :(
[12:54:56] <mrig> pyzozord: not entirely on networking, this would be domain specific, just that in most cases it likely would.

[12:56:52] <mrig> shame, as 50 years or so ago, I doubt that it was quite the same.
[12:58:29] <mercenary> pyzozord: it is not always about friendships. It is also about someone remembering 'in that place I worked in 5 years ago, there was this person who was good at X. We need X done.'

You look not even 50 years ago and people had their own pride and manners; it often conflicted with others but they would still hold their own in mutual respect and often learn something from each other in the process.

[16:43:37] <PlanckWalk> You need a stronger type system than most OOP languages for that
[16:44:02] <CoderGuy> PlanckWalk, well what would you do in this situation where you only want to accept implementations that have multiple interfaces?
[16:44:23] <PlanckWalk> It depends upon what you're doing with the type
[16:45:12] <CoderGuy> well, lets give an example, I want Cars from Japanese manufacturers, so it's a car but also it has manufacturer info
[16:46:03] <PlanckWalk> Are you designing a type system, or using an existing one?
[16:46:14] <PlanckWalk> Your options are much more limited in the latter case
[16:46:15] <beaky> with rust traits you can list the traits together like fn f<T: A+B>(x: T) the type T has both traits A and B
[16:46:18] <CoderGuy> umm using say c# I think c# is the best example
[16:46:36] <CoderGuy> yeah idk anything about Rust
[16:46:52] <PlanckWalk> E.g. are the Car and Manufactured interfaces defined by some library?
[16:46:59] <PlanckWalk> Or are they types that you plan to define?
[16:47:00] <CoderGuy> yeah your own
[16:47:29] <CoderGuy> you can set it up however you want, but ideally you can have a Car Interface and a Manufacturer interface, but ultimately I want to pass the object that implements both
[16:47:32] <PlanckWalk> If you plan to define them yourself, then you can use a subinterface type of both
[16:47:47] <CoderGuy> right so does that mean you have a third interface that has both?
[16:47:59] <PlanckWalk> Yes, though that also has disadvantages

[16:48:32] <PlanckWalk> E.g. if some other type "happens to" implement both the desired interfaces but not the combined interface, it will be rejected.
[16:48:43] <vdamewood> The problem with that solution, though, is that ... that.
[16:48:44] <eson123> anyone here has tried to code the "contact me" form ? i am wondering about the backend, usually do they have to create a totally seperate email address which doesn't contain any sensitive information to send whatever the user submits to the contact me form or another mechanism ?
[16:48:45] *** Quits: RenAdjest2 (~RenAdjest@user/renadjest) (Client Quit)
[16:48:47] <CoderGuy> yeah so what do you do about that problem?
[16:49:09] <PlanckWalk> The generic type signature approach can work, but has its own problems
[16:49:18] <vdamewood> eson123: I usually just use contact-form@ or something like that.
[16:49:19] <CoderGuy> eson123, I have answers one sec
[16:49:43] <CoderGuy> ugh PlanckWalk sounds like a "pros/cons" answer I hate those lol
[16:49:52] <eson123> vdamewood: wait, what "contact-form@" ? without any domain behind it ?
[16:49:53] <PlanckWalk> E.g. such signatures are usually only defined within the scope of a single method.
[16:50:09] <vdamewood> eson123: No, the domain is implied by the site that the form is on.
[16:50:13] <CoderGuy> yeah
[16:50:17] <CoderGuy> sigh, what should I do?
[16:51:13] <PlanckWalk> You may be loading too much work onto your language's type system.

[16:51:47] <CoderGuy> I guess I could try catch it
[16:52:24] <PlanckWalk> A generic type signature would let you reject at compile time
[16:52:36] <PlanckWalk> But not do much else
[16:52:37] <CoderGuy> how would you generic it?
[16:52:41] <CoderGuy> oh the <t>
[16:52:41] <vdamewood> eson123: No.
[16:53:00] <CoderGuy> yeah I like the generic idea
[16:53:17] <eson123> i will try to ask this in Python, maybe they have some examples
[16:53:21] <PlanckWalk> The downside is that it's hard to carry such a signature through anywhere else.
[16:53:41] <CoderGuy> yeah I would have to check everytime
[16:53:43] <PlanckWalk> E.g. you probably can't declare a container for such objects.

[16:55:38] <bayaz> Title: Ideone.com 
[16:55:50] <PlanckWalk> The problem normally doesn't come up much since it's unusual to have multiple classes that all implement two interfaces

[16:57:26] *** Quits: iridium__ (~iridium@122.175.247.252) (Quit: leaving)
[16:57:42] <CoderGuy> yeah that's why I think the third interface makes sense because it says "you want these things to share a common ancestor, so make them"
[16:58:07] <CoderGuy> so if they all must have something in common perhaps that thing in common is there interface
[16:59:03] <CoderGuy> oh well atleast I discussed it, now lets help this guy with his email form
[16:59:05] <beaky> yes the third interface version is one way to combine the two without having to use the generics with constraints on type parameters approach
[16:59:58] <beaky> but i think C# does not automagically provide an implementation for that third interface
[17:00:15] <CoderGuy> eson123, contact me forms have 2 samples of which I prefer the database method, HOWEVER doesn't have to be a database could just be a file
[17:00:41] <CoderGuy> eson123, in the database or storedata method, you simply take what the user submits to the contact me form, and store it inside a database

[17:01:19] <CoderGuy> and in the terrible "i'm a newbie I don't know how the internet works" version, you can send the data through email to your client, this works but it is super bad and not ideal
[17:02:01] <CoderGuy> a contact form should simply store whatever the user submits in a database of which you can go over it, BUT if you want 1 to 1 communication sure you could allow them to send an email to the client
[17:02:54] <CoderGuy> oh and to be specific when I say client I just mean the person who is the holder of the contact me form
[17:03:50] <eson123> CoderGuy: by that you mean the admin ? so far that is what i get from "holder"
[17:04:04] <eson123> but in that case, "client" is a bit weird to be fit there tho
[17:04:06] <CoderGuy> sure the admin of the contact me address
[17:04:25] <CoderGuy> yeah client is a bad word when talking about coding, but generally the person you're building the site for is what I mean
[17:04:37] <eson123> awh
[17:04:41] <eson123> ok that make more sense
[17:04:43] <CoderGuy> the problem is people can spam a contact me form
[17:04:53] <CoderGuy> so to avoid "spam" especially on email, you store it in a database
[17:05:11] <CoderGuy> then you can even setup paramaters behind the contact, to check "hey have you used this multiple times..k sto pit"
[17:05:14] <eson123> well that can still result in bad situations of overflowing my database, wasting memory
[17:05:21] <CoderGuy> not if you set limitations
[17:05:36] <CoderGuy> "I want to store a post" "ya do, lemme check something, you have done this already in the past 5 minutes, wait your time"
[17:05:54] <CoderGuy> but if you setup to just email on command, well now spam will happen
[17:06:07] <CoderGuy> so in both cases I recommend some type of a database to monitor the activity

[17:08:06] <Gamara> Hey so I have 2 variables playerId, and client connection (client) object. I need to be able to lookup playerId from client and lookup client from playerId. What data structure should I use for this, should I just use two hashmaps (arrays), I am using PHP
[17:08:32] <nitrix> A bidirectional hashmap, aka two hashmaps.
[17:09:23] <[itchyjunk]> oh fancy hashmaps
[17:09:32] <CoderGuy> Gamara, sounds like something you could easily solve by searching a database, but also if you want to do from cache literally any type of a dictionary or key/pair value would work, but yeah ultimately a hashmap as people are suggesting
[17:09:36] <[itchyjunk]> would you then put the two hasmaps inside some other structure ?
[17:09:44] <[itchyjunk]> like a linked list or something ?
[17:09:47] <nitrix> When the language allows sharing objects (references or pointers), it's possible to have the keys of one be the values of the other without doubling the memory requirement.
[17:10:09] *** Joins: hexfive (~eric@50.35.83.177)
[17:10:28] <[itchyjunk]> hmmm sharing refrences? never heard of such a concept!
[17:10:31] <nitrix> That probably doesn't matter much for your case, since they're merely IDs, which I assume aren't very large (probably integers).
[17:10:38] <[itchyjunk]> what's a super simple example? trying to wrap my head around it
[17:10:38] <Gamara> there are references in PHP I think
[17:10:54] <nitrix> Yes, but you need a wrapper object in PHP.
[17:10:54] <CoderGuy> Gamara, cuz what you have is this [{PlayerID:1,ClientObject:sldfkjsdlfkj},{PlayerID:2,ClientObject:sdlfkjsdflkjuuuu}]
[17:11:14] <eson123> CoderGuy: ok thank for the advise, i will try database with some captcha, not sure about the "setup server cache" tho, didn't quite get that but still useful enough
[17:11:29] <CoderGuy> Gamara, so basically you need something that allows you to search over based on PlayerID or based on ClientObject, which is what HashMaps are built for
[17:11:44] <Gamara> I know I needed to use a hashmap :P
[17:11:52] <Gamara> I just was wondering if there was a clean way to do it
[17:12:02] <eson123> CoderGuy: also i still wonder that does the request that is sent back to the client which passed through CAPTCHA has some extra parameters in its HTTP request or not, if not then people can still write scripts to bypass captcha and spam
[17:12:02] <Gamara> since hashmaps arent memory efficient 
[17:12:02] <CoderGuy> Gamara, but at the same time, it's also what databases are super good at "select from players where playerid:2" or whatever it is
[17:12:10] <nitrix> Oh, then you want a broom then.
[17:12:19] <Gamara> I am using a websocket server lol
[17:12:28] <Gamara> So I am just using memory
[17:12:41] <Gamara> I was thinking of setting up redis but it seems pointless
[17:12:42] <merijn> You can have database that's just in memory...
[17:12:49] <merijn> See, SQLite
[17:12:55] <CoderGuy> Gamara, yeah i'm sure there are many ways to do it, you just need to be able to lookover the values, if you know for example that the user is going to submit a playerid, then a keypair value is great cuz Key=>PlayerID,Value=>ClientObject
[17:12:57] <Gamara> since the websocket framework seems to handle caching
[17:13:18] <[itchyjunk]> sqlite is a db but only in memory? it's deleted when the application closes? @_@
[17:13:18] <CoderGuy> Gamara, in that sample, well now you can just get from the key/pair where the key matches

[17:13:40] <nitrix> CoderGuy, They want both directions, PlayerID to ClientObject as well as ClientObject to PlayerId.
[17:13:45] <CoderGuy> Gamara, but you can't scale this, if there are 3 values it's not gonna work, so ultimately it will become a dictionary or a map, the map helps once you're out of keys
[17:13:46] <merijn> [itchyjunk]: SQLite can use memory and file based storage
[17:14:00] <[itchyjunk]> ah both
[17:14:01] <CoderGuy> nitrix, well yeah but that's just search based on key or search based on value
[17:14:04] <merijn> [itchyjunk]: If you use memory only, then all data is gone when you shutdown, yes
[17:14:13] <[itchyjunk]> interesting concept
[17:14:14] <merijn> [itchyjunk]: Still useful in many cases
[17:14:20] <[itchyjunk]> yeah
[17:14:21] <CoderGuy> nitrix, if it's binary you can do that easily but once it becomes multiple so say PlayerID,ClientObject,Date  well now you have issues
[17:14:39] <merijn> [itchyjunk]: Like: Load CSV file into database, run SQL queries on it, etc.
[17:14:46] <CoderGuy> nitrix, so I agree with using a Map just to avoid once it scales
[17:15:05] <CoderGuy> it's also just ideal to use a Map
[17:15:23] <[itchyjunk]> a database is just some datastructure right?
[17:15:28] <CoderGuy> yup
[17:15:31] <nitrix> CoderGuy, Depends which ones are indexed. The row becomes the tuple (PlayerID, ClientObject, Data), the indexes are over PlayerID (probably a BTree) and ClientObject (probably a hashmap).
[17:15:42] <[itchyjunk]> isn't like a haspmap also a database then?
[17:15:49] <CoderGuy> sure sure
[17:16:05] <[itchyjunk]> oh interesting. i have never thought of them as being the same thing for some reason
[17:16:08] <CoderGuy> yup [itchyjunk] but it's one with a lot of cool lookup commands lol
[17:16:25] <merijn> [itchyjunk]: I mean, it depends on how you define database

[17:16:34] <CoderGuy> databases just have really nice search functions and abilities to manipulate and also "persistent?" idk it stores for longer
[17:16:41] <mishugana> what's a tabase?
[17:16:41] <[itchyjunk]> merijn, i don't have a working definition
[17:16:52] <[itchyjunk]> i am not really not sure what a database it
[17:16:53] <[itchyjunk]> is
[17:16:58] <merijn> CoderGuy: More than just that, there's also things like ACID
[17:17:14] <[itchyjunk]> but sqlite is a database that's not persistant
[17:17:19] <CoderGuy> oh yeah of course, it's just people spent a long time making them work way better for storing data and retreiving it, but obviously cache can be faster
[17:17:20] <mishugana> and ALKALI, of course
[17:17:33] <merijn> [itchyjunk]: If you use a file backend it *is* persistent
[17:17:48] <nitrix> SQLite has different backends, some are disk-based, some are memory-based, you can also provide your own.
[17:17:48] <mishugana> like the persistent buzzing in my ears
[17:17:49] <[itchyjunk]> i could say the same about hashmaps no?
[17:17:52] <CoderGuy> true you could just store the cache to file
[17:17:56] <[itchyjunk]> i could always write it to some flatfile
[17:18:03] <CoderGuy> in that case having a map is perfectly fine you don't "need" a database, they're just fun
[17:18:11] <mishugana> can we use papyrus?
[17:18:27] <merijn> [itchyjunk]: SQLite can handle much more things than "hashmap in a file" and more efficiently too

[17:21:29] <[itchyjunk]> like i still can't tell the difference between array and list in java properly
[17:21:38] <nitrix> Flat files don't have indexes to help you query them. You'd have to artificially build that functionally on top of them to emulate a database.
[17:21:45] <CoderGuy> a list is just a datatype that makes it easier to deal with the array problem
[17:21:46] <mishugana> [itchyjunk]: you're trolling, right? :D

[17:24:23] <CoderGuy> [itchyjunk], the testing is god like as well go right into your browser
[17:24:28] <[itchyjunk]> just seems a bit security risky that js can talk to servers
[17:24:41] <CoderGuy> [itchyjunk], well no in this case the javascript is the server

[19:49:08] <oldlaptop> There are "sql fiddle" sites that let you play around freely without setting up a client/server DBMS yourself - you could find one that supports postgres, for example, and work through the examples in the postgres tutorial if you haven't already

[19:49:25] <pyzozord> (just want to return two values)
[19:49:43] <oldlaptop> sqlite's command shell is also very handy for this kind of thing, because it runs everywhere and requires zero setup to get you a working RDBMS to play with

[19:50:24] <greyblue9> sum is an 'aggregate' function meaning it consumes values from multiple rows (like `sum`, `average`, etc) which you need to use  `having` with instead of `where`

[22:01:42] <teut> A file is the common storage unit in a computer, and all programs and data are "written" into a file and "read" from a file. A folder holds one or more files, and a folder can be empty until it is filled. A folder can also contain other folders, and there can be many levels of folders within folders.

[23:39:55] <Izem> even though it's sufficient technically
[23:40:03] <oldlaptop> keep in mind that something like Google Docs (which is an important application for these kind of machines) will take up something like 150-200MiB per open document, to say nothing of all the js it's running
[23:41:02] <oldlaptop> and of course vendors of web-based "learning management systems" are modern web developers like any other, and so their pages weigh a ton and do a whole lot of rendering on the client - in javascript, on that CPU, which is also doing other things
