[17:20:41] <Joanna> e5e5e5Hi _inky inky I find your privacy discussions interesting. There have been rumors floating around about people who want to control who want to use internet and some sort of cyber attack to take down internet. Any idea how to mitigate that? You can maybe run your own server using a numerical IP address but you still depend upon an isp for actual access to internet and they can demand whatever info they like right ?

[18:30:01] <jan6> it's an "overlay" network, and not exactly privacy focused (so no onion or garlic routing or such jazz), but you just need SOMEONE to provide a proxy service to normal net, and boom
[18:31:04] <jan6> and since the IPs are bound by cryptography, not any ISPs, you'll have the same IP no matter if you have internet, or where you physically are
[18:32:00] <jan6> and as it's encrypted, it can be used as basically a VPN, for accessing your own devices, too

[20:04:38] <Joanna> jan6: would that work if you don’t have your own internet service like if you couldn’t get an account with local isp?
[20:11:50] *** Joins: genera (~Genera@user/genera)
[20:16:15] <iz> i think he's implying that someone could
[20:16:25] <iz> and could provide service to others via meshing
[20:16:35] <iz> or even via wifi
[20:18:30] *** Quits: treble (~treble@user/treble) (Quit: WeeChat 3.4)
[20:24:29] <jan6> pretty much
[20:27:21] <jan6> yggdrasil can network either locally, or over internet, and someone on the other side can provide a proxy that lets you access normalnet, which, if any node you have access to, has access to, means you can use
[20:27:36] <Joanna> If the wifi isn’t password protected?
[20:43:42] *** Joins: Malvolio (~Malvolio@user/malvolio)
[21:35:17] <jan6> who cares
[21:35:20] <jan6> it's an overlay
[21:35:47] <jan6> just like "would NordVPN work if wifi is password protected", it's the same nonsense
[21:37:15] <jan6> if you want to tunnel through internet, you just need SOME interface, that can reach internet, be it wifi, cellular (e.g. 4g dongle or builtin adapter, or phone tethering), fancy pants satellite internet, ethernet, or whatever else sort of method
[21:37:58] <jan6> as long as the OS knows where to send packets from/to, it doesn't matter what technology or drivers it uses

[22:41:54] <_inky> jan6: thank you for explanations, because just today i was reading yet another yggdrasil article.
[22:42:09] <_inky> https://changelog.complete.org/archives/10319-make-the-internet-yours-again-with-an-instant-mesh-network
[22:42:10] <SeaDough> ^ Make the Internet Yours Again With an Instant Mesh Network | The Changelog
[22:43:19] <_inky> my understanding in the context of the Joanna's question is (though the yggdrasil sure sounds inspiring) 
[22:43:29] <jan6> yeah, ygg people were slightly wondering @that, as it seems articles about yggdrasil are written when there's NOT been anything new, and not when there IS something, like a new release, lol
[22:43:45] <_inky> (:
[22:44:05] <_inky> my understanding is ygg still needs to rely on physical networks (even if wireless)
[22:44:18] <_inky> and the networks it uses now are ISP's.
[22:44:27] <_inky> in case of apocalypse, when 
[22:44:35] <jan6> well, not really
[22:44:57] <_inky> somebody taked down ISP's, my network gets disconnected from yours, and we need to setup own network infrastructure.
[22:45:06] <jan6> it can use normal networks as transport, to make it easier to use, because otherwise you're limited to your LAN network only
[22:45:18] <_inky> but if we did it in the first time, without ISP's we would not need ISP's. but that's money we did not able to spend.
[22:45:21] <jan6> like all the other mesh networks are
[22:45:51] <_inky> what do you mean by 'normal networks'?
[22:45:55] <jan6> you will always need ISPs, unless you manage to establish a mesh network chain all across the world, or at least across each continent
[22:46:27] <jan6> well, normal ISP networks, and optionally you could add Tor or I2P or such on top
[22:46:36] <_inky> okay i think i understand it more or less right.
[22:47:08] <_inky> back to the original question, i think it doesn't help if we imagine that all ISP's will be taken down suddenly.
[22:47:20] <_inky> but let me ask you another question
[22:47:56] <jan6> except, not ALL will, and sattellite internet is TECHNICALLY a thing, which is a lot harder to force down
[22:47:57] <_inky> can i host a server at home
[22:48:10] <_inky> if i only have not real IP behind the NAT?
[22:48:36] <jan6> you can totally airgap from the internet if you want, but if you do, it's not much better than any other mesh
[22:48:56] <jan6> just like TECHNICALLY you could run your own personal Tor network
[22:49:05] <jan6> but it's not really useful, if nobody else can access it
[22:49:26] <_inky> yes that part i understand. but can i have a global DNS domain and IP that is routed from normal Internet?
[22:49:37] <_inky> so that other people 
[22:49:46] <jan6> it's an overlay network, it doesn't conflict with normal internet
[22:49:47] <_inky> they don't need to install something to access my server?
[22:50:04] <jan6> you can share your personal subnet, in your LAN
[22:50:13] <_inky> in case of tor i can host a site, but the clients have to install a tor service and use it.
[22:50:31] <jan6> basically yells out "HEY ANYONE WANT TO ACCESS THIS IP RANGE, I GOT IPs AND I GOT ROUTES TO THERE"
[22:50:32] <jan6> lol
[22:51:12] <jan6> but it's not reccommended if possible, because there's less bits of uniqueness, although it works just fine
[22:51:17] <jan6> you can even do that over VPN
[22:51:44] <jan6> I have normal ipv4 + ipv6 + yggdrasil ipv6 all working through wireguard tunnel, automagically ;P
[22:52:16] <_inky> ok let me put it the other way, imagine someone wants to have a globally accessible server on a phone (and he has virtually unlimited battery, no need to sleep)
[22:52:39] <_inky> he changes networks, but has the same IP in ygg
[22:53:00] <_inky> but can he host a site which is visible from the global internet with global dns?
[22:53:21] <_inky> can he tell the friend - just write this domain in your browser and my phone will answer?
[22:53:27] <jan6> DNS is unrelated
[22:53:32] <_inky> okay type that IP
[22:53:48] <_inky> is that IP visible from the Internet without a special setup on the client side?
[22:54:02] <_inky> that's what i am interested in: selfhosting.
[22:54:03] <jan6> but obviously you can't access it, if you don't run a node, and nobody on your LAN is sharing a subnet
[22:54:17] <jan6> because the standard networking infrastructure doesn't know how to reach it
[22:54:23] <_inky> so the client needs to be a part of ygg right?
[22:54:33] <_inky> heh.
[22:54:40] <jan6> someone on the LAN can share the subnet too, as I said
[22:54:49] <jan6> you can also ask in #yggdrasil, lol
[22:55:02] <_inky> true, didn't think there is a channel.
[22:55:38] <jan6> but you not only have a static address, but along with it, a personal /64 subnet you can share with any devices, which is useful to let devices or people who can't, or don't want to run a node, to use the network
[22:56:01] <jan6> e.g. set up your router to share your prefix, and anyone connecting will magically be able to reach yggdrasil
[22:56:17] <jan6> (can also share from any other computer, probably)
[23:00:27] <_inky> by the way, what will work is #ssb
[23:00:31] <_inky> secure scuttlebutt
[23:01:45] <_inky> because it is currently used by offgrid people. they meet and exchange information via it.
[23:02:12] <_inky> they also can use a host which is accessible to both of them on the internet or just somewhere.
[23:02:31] <_inky> that host emulates a common friend, and they are able to get messages by using common friends too.
[23:03:10] <_inky> so imagine my city has no internet, but i can go once a day to the physical place and sync with my friends, or with the host that will sync their data to me.
[23:05:54] <jan6> that works just as well
[23:06:15] <jan6> like, if ISPs are down, do you really think that people will be able to cross the borders any easier than get internet?
[23:07:12] <jan6> scuttlebutt's main flaw is its working principle, it requires you to store all of the data, yourself
