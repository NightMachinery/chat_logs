[00:57:23] <JD-Robbs> Sure, though, you've got the source showing rather than just the signatures?
[00:58:24] <Suchiman> JD-Robbs: i don't think there's a way in VS for that, especially for .NET Framework
[00:58:37] <DoofusCanadensis> that sounds dumb
[00:58:41] <Suchiman> there's .NET Framework source stepping which allows you to F11 into .NET Framework calls and have the source available
[00:58:46] <Suchiman> but it's not surfaced for F12
[00:59:15] <JD-Robbs> Yep, saw the Debug support. Ah shame, cheers though for chiming in.
[00:59:47] <Suchiman> JD-Robbs: they did add in the most recent version though https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/releases/2022/release-notes#summary-of-whats-new-in-this-release-of-visual-studio-2022-version-1710
[00:59:55] <Suchiman> "When building managed libraries developers can choose to embed their source files with the debug information (PDB file) that is produced by the build, and even embed the PDB file into the assembly itself. We now surface embedded source as part of Go to Definition if a referenced assembly has embedded source and the PDB is available. This allows you to navigate to the original source files that declare the target symbol. Place your cursor on
[00:59:55] <Suchiman> a symbol and press F12 to navigate to the original source file."

[02:24:22] <Suchiman> Nasp: yeah that's the part i don't know about exactly, basically if you look at the latency that's promised in the portal, the best case is same as business critical (SSD) and the worst case is from general purpose (access to blob storage)

[02:24:54] <Nasp> That seems high
[02:25:09] <Nasp> Suchiman:  We just crossed 1.5TB

[02:27:45] <Suchiman> thank god azure enabled using geo replication to get off azure germany before shutting it down

[02:27:47] <bomb> pandem Sao Paolo is so f#$%ing big it took me hours to find you
[02:27:53] <Suchiman> so we didn't have to go the bacpac route

[02:32:59] <Suchiman> Nasp: but like i said, the PITR backups are geo replicated so if like ~5 minute data loss is acceptable to you, you could restore that backup on the secondary region and then have to wait like 1~2h for the backup to restore

[02:33:43] <mkf9> are dumb csharp questions welcome here?
[02:34:02] <Nasp> Suchiman:  Like i'd rather take the hit of that downtime than an entires day of outage
[02:34:07] <Nasp> Due to someone being to cheap with the DB
[02:34:10] <Nasp> Ohh and it was the CTO :D
[02:34:19] <Nasp> "No we don't need to scale to the usual database size"
[02:34:20] <bomb> what does "Sé" mean?
[02:34:38] <Suchiman> Nasp: well PITR backups are using the grandfather father son principle, you get a full database backup like twice a week, an incremental backup every 6h or so and a transaction log backup every 5 minutes
[02:35:07] <Nasp> Suchiman:  Hmm and that's enabled by default or?
[02:35:11] <Suchiman> Nasp: yes
[02:35:20] <Nasp> Oh well

[02:41:22] <bpmedley> mkf9 : The C# language spec makes no guarantee about the internal representation of a string. However, it implements the index operator to provide a char for each character in the string.

[02:41:30] <mkf9> or why they added it to csharp in first place
[02:41:35] <Suchiman> mkf9: well... some minor details, first and foremost, they're different types so the typesystem says they're not the same but other than that arrays and strings are both length prefixed with an integer, sequentially followed by it's elements. The special thing about string is, is that there will also be 2 trailing 0 bytes for null termination

[02:49:28] <Suchiman> jonp: although C# started going a bit in that direction, with readonly structs and readonly methods
[02:49:37] <jonp> a bit, but not the same
[02:49:45] <jonp> you can't overload a method based on `const`
[02:50:12] <Suchiman> jonp: ... can you in C++?
[02:50:17] <jonp> yes
[02:50:25] * Suchiman thinks he should better go to sleep now
[02:50:43] <jonp> Suchiman: https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/vector/operator_at
[02:50:48] <mkf9> jonp: wdym by varible itself can't changed?
[02:50:55] <jonp> notice `reference operator[]( size_type pos );` and `const_reference operator[]( size_type pos ) const;`
[02:51:03] <jonp> the ` const;` suffix means it's a "const member function"
[02:51:12] <jonp> and can be invoked on `const` variables
[02:51:14] <Suchiman> ah can you even overload by constexpr...
[02:51:40] <jonp> mkf9: conceptually, this isn't valid: `readonly int A = 42; A = 64;`
[02:51:48] <jonp> in practice you need to work harder
[02:52:06] <jonp> `readonly` means that the constructor can change it as often as it wants, or the static constructor (for static members)
[02:52:08] <Nasp> Suchiman:  Anyways regarding data deletiong i think we can delete between 20-50%
[02:52:15] *** Quits: bomb (~bomb@user/bomb) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[02:52:19] <jonp> mkf9: but once the (static) constructor has finished running, it can't be changed.
[02:52:27] <Suchiman> Nasp: neat, dew it
[02:52:37] <jonp> mkf9: `class Example { public static readonly int A = 42; } /* … */ Example.A = 64; // error`
[02:52:43] <Nasp> Also i think we get around GDPR by saying it's companies and not people
[02:52:53] <jonp> mkf9: but that's "shallow"
[02:53:10] <Nasp> Suchiman: Well it would be a rather large project to figure out what to delete and how you delete it
[02:53:17] <jonp> mkf9: `class Example {public static readonly char[] A = new char[1];} /* ... */ Example.A[0] = 'a'; // valid!`
[02:53:43] <Suchiman> Nasp: well, if it's easier, figure what not to delete and delete the rest :P
[02:54:13] <Nasp> Suchiman: Would be easier if we had some EF graph that contained all the data for a specific user
[02:54:26] * Suchiman has that
[02:54:30] <Nasp> Hmm
[02:54:36] <Nasp> And have you made a way to delete it?
[02:54:41] <Suchiman> yes
[02:54:49] <Nasp> I was kinda doing a graph for deleting it across microservices
[02:54:56] <Nasp> So service A knew it had a dependency on Service B
[02:55:02] <Suchiman> every table basically has a Profile_Id flag that references the StorageProfile table
[02:55:07] <Nasp> So the deletion service should delete it from A first and then B
[02:55:23] <Nasp> Suchiman:  So every table has a tenant id, even though it isnt needed?
[02:55:27] <Suchiman> Nasp: ah, the benefits of a monolith xD
[02:55:30] <Nasp> It probably makes searching faster as well
[02:55:32] <Nasp> Well we have both
[02:55:38] <Nasp> A monolith and 100 microservices
[02:56:15] <Nasp> I also want to mark all PII with an attribute so it's easier to identify
[02:56:18] <Nasp> And make living docs :D
[02:56:34] <Suchiman> Nasp: yeah, originally i was like "well i could join 5 tables together... or copy this to every table..." eventually i went with the "copy it to every table" approach, as i felt like adding one more integer column to tables that have up to 400 columns doesn't do much damage and helps perf a lot xD
[02:56:44] <mkf9> jonp: i see

[02:57:17] <Nasp> Suchiman:  It's EF6 right?
[02:57:22] <Nasp> I soo wanna use query filters
[02:57:23] <Suchiman> yep
[02:57:31] <Nasp> Which would also be easier of each table had the tenant id
[02:57:43] <mkf9> thanks a lot bpmedley, Suchiman and jonp.
[02:57:46] <Nasp> Which it will often end up with anyways
[02:57:47] <Suchiman> and if everything goes well... we might be upgrading from MVC 5 / WebAPI 2 to Core 6 soon (TM)
[02:57:57] <Nasp> Uhh
[02:58:01] <Suchiman> but keeping EF6 because fuck migrating that xD
[02:58:02] <Nasp> I'm in progress as you know
[02:58:05] <Nasp> For like 6 months now
[02:58:19] <Nasp> I've considered if we shoud look at EF but yeah
[02:58:22] <Nasp> It's fucking huge
[02:58:23] <bpmedley> mkf9 : Just out of curiosity, are you attempting something like "hello"[0] = 'j' ?
[02:58:33] <Nasp> But we have like 30 DBContext in the monolith so we could take some of them
[02:59:10] <Suchiman> Nasp: nah i have just one monothlith DbContext xD
[02:59:27] <Suchiman> with over a hundred tables and up to 400 props a class xD
[02:59:32] <Nasp> Also with the switch to aspnetcore you may need to keep newtonsoft as well
[02:59:48] <Suchiman> Nasp: definitively, we rely on a lot of customization with newtonsoft xD
[02:59:52] <Nasp> Samesies
[03:00:01] <Nasp> Although we didnt' it's only recently we started doing that
[03:00:16] <Nasp> I was thinking of looking into doing double serialization
[03:00:27] <Nasp> So i could  serialize using both serialize and compare the result and log a warning
[03:00:35] <Suchiman> oh
[03:00:45] <Nasp> I think that would be a nifty way to find all the difference
[03:01:00] <Nasp> Although expensive for performance while doing it ofc
[03:01:14] <Suchiman> well i mean, i know the differences, like we have a custom contract resolver that only serializes props that were asked for, and a few other things
[03:01:16] <bpmedley> Nasp : When do you plan on migrating to .NET 7?
[03:01:24] <Nasp> bpmedley:  As soon as it comes out
[03:01:35] <Nasp> I hope we will be done with the .NET 5 migration
[03:01:40] <Nasp> Then imediatly we wil lgo for .NET 6
[03:01:50] <Nasp> And then i hope when 7 is release, we will run that 2-3 days after
[03:01:54] <bpmedley> Would a few months before .NET 7 comes out be a good time to start planning any EF Core migration?
[03:02:00] <Nasp> Suchiman:  Yeah i know most of the difference as well, but there are also others
[03:02:01] <Suchiman> Nasp: and then after that... i might look at upgrading that .NET Core 3.1 app that's using EF Core 2.1 xD
[03:02:11] <jonp> bpmedley: so…August?
[03:02:13] <Nasp> bpmedley:  Sure it would
[03:02:32] <Nasp> Suchiman: We did 2.1 -> 3.1 to .NET 5 for the Core services
[03:02:42] <bpmedley> Nasp : The reason I ask, is because EF Core 7 looks like, if many of the features are realized, will be a really great release.
[03:02:46] <Nasp> And then we stopped and got approved to do the monolith, but man that's some work
[03:02:50] <bpmedley> jonp : Dunno about the specific month
[03:02:54] <mkf9> bpmedley: no, but i was confused first i saw c# has both char[] and string
[03:03:02] <bpmedley> mkf9 : Understood, thanks
[03:03:07] <Nasp> bpmedley:  You can always keep waiting for the next release
[03:03:16] <jonp> bpmedley: give or take.  .NET 7 should be released in November
[03:03:24] <Suchiman> mkf9: well C++ also has std::string ;)
[03:03:26] <Nasp> Suchiman:  I also can't wait to get this moved and then kill IIS in the next project
[03:03:31] <jonp> "a few months before" would be…August
[03:03:46] <Nasp> bpmedley: Also are you using EF6 on Core?
[03:04:01] <bpmedley> Nasp : My rational for asking is because, from the few conversations we've had, I feel there a couple specific EF Core 7 features you would really like.
[03:04:06] <Suchiman> Nasp: apparently management considers azure finally expensive and is looking at containerization to not depend on app service too much (TM)
[03:04:16] <jonp> Suchiman: C++ has `char*`, `char[]`, `std::string`, `std::wstring`, and a few more if you look at e.g. MFC (CString) or Qt (QString) or…
[03:04:21] <bpmedley> jonp : Makes sense, I was not trying to pin down a specific month.  Just a general idea..
[03:04:27] <jonp> right
[03:04:32] <jonp> "general idea" is "summer"
[03:04:36] <bpmedley> Nasp : I use EF Core 5, 3.1, and 6.
[03:04:42] <Nasp> Suchiman: Well we move half to google
[03:04:47] <Suchiman> jonp: and ofc `wchar_t*`, `wchar_t[]` ;)
[03:04:53] <jonp> of course!
[03:04:54] <bpmedley> Nasp : If you want the specific features, I can dig them up..
[03:04:55] <Nasp> So containers in Azure -> database in google
[03:05:00] <Nasp> IIS in google -> database in Azure :D
[03:05:04] <Suchiman> Nasp: ... weird
[03:05:07] <jonp> not that anyone should ever use wchar_t for anything…
[03:05:12] <Nasp> Suchiman:  Yes, and with no plans to finish the move
[03:05:21] <Nasp> And we've had issues due to different datacenters / providers
[03:05:46] <Nasp> Suchiman:  Also we just decided on Kubernetes for containers
[03:05:53] <Nasp> Took forever to decide that
[03:05:59] <Suchiman> ewww
[03:06:05] <Suchiman> Nasp: what alternatives are there anyway :P ?
[03:06:18] <mkf9> Suchiman: TIL, i have never used anything besides C :)
[03:07:01] <Nasp> Eww to kubernetes or
[03:07:10] <Nasp> Suchiman: Well there are other things like cloudrun and functions in google
[03:07:19] <Nasp> But most didn't like those and they dont fit as well and many unknowns
[03:09:03] <Suchiman> mkf9: oh well yeah in that case everything is just bytes to you i guess, btw. C# char is 2 bytes (wchar_t essentially, utf16)
[03:09:13] <Suchiman> and linear memory space xD
[03:14:19] <mkf9> nice, thanks :)

[04:07:49] <lz_> guys guys guys i have a problem
[04:08:07] <bjorkintosh> regarding?
[04:08:16] <lz_> 1st i received an email saying the configuration of my "onedrive" is "almost finished" but I never used it
[04:08:25] <lz_> should I be fucking worried?
[04:08:36] <bpmedley> lz_ : Is it a phishing email?
[04:08:40] <lz_> does that mean someone logged in with my email ?
[04:08:42] <bjorkintosh> go examine it.
[04:08:49] <lz_> bpmedley: doesn't look like one
[04:09:03] <pandem> send me your password and i can check if its legit
[04:09:15] <bpmedley> lz_ : I would validate the MIME header's To and From fields.
[04:09:40] <lz_> 2nd i realized the emails i was sending to a contact were send to another contact with a weird address of the form "outlook_someguid@outlook.com"
[04:09:53] <lz_> and what is fucking weird: this happens if I send an email from thunderbird, but not from hotmail
[04:09:54] <bjorkintosh> or lz_ go and look and see if the onedrive is indeed 'almost finished'.
[04:10:10] <lz_> my contact *is not* a hotmail or outlook contact, it's a gmail address
[04:10:10] <bpmedley> lz_ : Did you validate the MIME headers?
[04:10:27] <lz_> tbh this is the 2nd problem that worries me the most
[04:10:46] <lz_> when i inspect the mails from my thunderbird client, both emails are to the gmail address, but from the webmail app, the 2nd email is this weird recipient
[04:11:27] <lz_> on a scale of 1 to 10, how much should i be worried right now? is my thunderbird compromised?
[04:11:43] <lz_> it's the only app i'm running in a virtual machine, and i only have like 1 extension for a dark theme
[04:11:51] <bpmedley> lz_ : Have you validated the MIME headers?
[04:12:07] <lz_> bpmedley: do you mean, to check whether or not the onedrive thing is a phishing link? not yet
[04:12:29] <lz_> bpmedley: but i inspected the "source message" of both copies of the emails I sent, and in thunderbird they don't match what shows in webmail
[04:12:49] <bpmedley> lz_ : Yes.  So you can ascertain if the "To" and "From" MIME fields are contextually accurate and relevant.
[04:13:49] <bpmedley> lz_ : https://www.lifewire.com/view-full-message-headers-thunderbird-1173106  <-- This may help
[04:14:38] <lz_> bpmedley: it absolutely looks legit. I'm convinced this is a real email from onedrive. I'm just wondering why it would happen
[04:14:41] <lz_> Authentication-Results: spf=pass (sender IP is 136.147.186.32) smtp.mailfrom=bounce.microsoftemails.com; dkim=pass (signature was verified) header.d=mail.onedrive.com;dmarc=pass action=none header.from=mail.onedrive.com;compauth=pass reason=100
[04:15:10] <lz_> why would i receive such email? why are copies of my emails sent to a weird outlook contact?
[04:15:17] <bpmedley> lz_ : An very strange think is that thunderbird and webmail differ.
[04:15:30] <bpmedley> Does your webmail have a "view source" option?
[04:16:10] <lz_> yes
[04:16:20] <lz_> i'll try to compare both sources, thanks for the idea
[04:16:27] <bpmedley> lz_ : Yes, perfect..
[04:17:13] <lz_> i can't find it for the sent emails :(
[04:19:11] <lz_> maybe one drive sent this email because i logged in on the webmail thing?
[04:21:11] <bpmedley> There are several possibilities. Did you say that you can no longer find the email in either webmail or thunderbird?
[04:21:42] <lz_> bpmedley: yes i can find the email in both, in 2 copies each time. just that the recipient doesn't match for the copy
[04:22:03] <bpmedley> lz_ : And you compared sources from both the webmail and thunderbird?
[04:22:06] <lz_> thunderbird shows 2 copies of the same mail, webmail shows 2 copies, but the 2nd one is sent to an outlook address
[04:22:15] <bpmedley> Bizarro email
[04:22:16] <lz_> i can't see the source for sent messages on webmail
[04:22:27] <bpmedley> Is it an IMAP account?
[04:22:32] <lz_> yes
[04:22:41] <lz_> i'm trying to reproduce the thing with another email from mine
[04:22:54] <bpmedley> Why are you looking at sent messages on webmail?  I guess I assumed these were in your INBOX..
[04:23:14] <lz_> when i try with an address of mine, i get the same 2 copies, but same address
[04:23:29] <lz_> bpmedley: i wanted to reply to some message i sent to add more info
[04:23:43] <_genuser_> hey guys, interesting GPU behavior. anybody seen this before?
[04:23:48] <lz_> bpmedley: i noticed the messages were sent in double; never paid attention because i thought that was a bug from thunderbird
[04:23:56] <lz_> but this time i noticed the 2nd email was sent to a weird address
[04:23:57] <_genuser_> after waking up from monitor blankout, it removes some display modes.
[04:24:02] <bpmedley> lz_ : I'm really confused.  You got some email that you assumed was from onedrive and replied?
[04:24:11] <lz_> bpmedley: lol no sorry i speak too fast
[04:24:39] <lz_> bpmedley: i noticed in my webmail outbox some message sent to a weird address. I also received an email from onedrive, but I don't know it's because I signed in to webmail
[04:24:57] <lz_> that's why i was more worried about the weird address thing
[04:25:35] <bpmedley> lz_ : Are you saying that there are strange messages in your "sent messages" that you don't think you specifically sent?
[04:25:51] <lz_> bpmedley: the content, I definitely sent, but not to that recipient
[04:26:23] <lz_> I'll edit the texts and try to show you how that looks
[04:26:34] <bpmedley> lz_ : Does the thunderbird source show a Reply-To or similar MIME header?
[04:27:49] <bpmedley> Sounds like an orchestrated phishing attempt, but I'm not 100% sure.
[04:28:00] <lz_> bpmedley: https://i.imgur.com/OiHI5wD.png
[04:28:13] <lz_> the "weird" contact actually contains info from the real contact. Like, a 2nd name
[04:28:48] <bpmedley> lz_ : I would examine the contents of the MIME headers in Thunderbird..
[04:28:49] <lz_> 1st contact is name "Name Surname", 2nd contact is named "Nickname OtherSurNameThatUsedToBeARealName"
[04:30:34] <lz_> bpmedley: the 2nd contact isn't showing in the thunderbird headers
[04:30:51] <lz_> i'll diff them but I'm pretty sure they'll be the same
[04:31:03] <bpmedley> lz_ : Specifically, I would examine the 1st email for a Reply-To or similar header.
[04:32:24] <lz_> ok so 2nd message has a bit more stuff in it. seriously i can't read headers, they're too complicated for me, but no trace of 2nd contact
[04:32:35] <lz_> either outlook is doing some weird shit, or i'm fucked

[04:39:33] <lz_> the outlook weird address looks related to this https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/outlook-com-email-account-appears-as-outlook-long-series-of-letters-and-numbers-outlook-com-in-outlook-for-windows-90ed7938-7f21-4cb5-a69d-a3b79ea4eafd
[04:40:32] <_genuser_> I think that's because it's a hotmail (possibly? due to the hotmail.com visible at the bottom) and that would definitely be getting handled by ms exchange server.
[04:40:47] <lz_> _genuser_: recipient is gmail
[04:41:03] <lz_> _genuser_: and the "wrong" recipient address is of the form outlook_blablabla@outlook.com
[04:41:11] <lz_> my address is hotmail
[04:42:33] <lz_> it's weird because I tried to do the exact same thing, ie sent an email from hotmail to a gmail address of mine, reply back and forth, and check if it was doing something of the sort but it doesn't. only happens with this specific gmail recipient
[04:43:06] <lz_> maybe the recipient has done sth weird with their gmail address and linked it to outlook or something
[04:44:04] <lz_> it has to be something the recipient has done, especially since it's showing private information of them (like the other legit name and nickname)
[04:44:43] <lz_> anyway thanks for helping me, i was fucking worried and i'm a little less worried now
[04:45:36] <lz_> i'm an engineer and i don't know how to tell what's happening with my emails. today is the day i give up
[04:46:14] <_genuser_> without seeing addresses, doesn't really look suspicious. in-reply-to probably had a different address than original sender. and the exchagne stuff seems from hotmail.
[04:46:42] <_genuser_> lol, I'm an engineer too. and I'm trying to run a dual monitor setup on a GPU that as one DP and one HDMI output.
[04:46:43] <lz_> _genuser_: I swear, the reply-to are the same. it's still showing the same in thunderbird
[04:47:10] <lz_> for some reason webmail is retrieving some informations thunderbird doesn't have
[04:47:29] <_genuser_> both work great on bootup, 2560x1440 @60Hz, amazing. Then monitor goes to sleep after inactivity and when it wakes up, HDMI output is lowered to 1920x1080 only. Can't even select 2560x1440 anymore.

[04:51:27] <_genuser_> I'm thinking either old card, or driver messing up. more inclined to believe driver.
[04:51:59] <_genuser_> here's the thing - in radeon settings software you can create a custom profile (while the resolution is available) and when it goes away, you use the settings and apply that custom profile and it will restore it.
[04:52:21] <_genuser_> But everytime you wakeup the computer because you walked away, going to settings and restoring the resolution is annoying.
[04:52:33] <_genuser_> currently looking for nvidia cheap gpu with two displayports, lol.
[04:52:53] <_genuser_> nothing with radeon. they install too much stuff with it and try to have all sorts of bloatware.
[04:53:48] <bpmedley> lz_ : Is that imgur of the 1st or 2nd emai/
[04:53:49] <bpmedley> ?
[04:54:07] <lz_> bpmedley: both, it's a diff (green is the difference). I deleted the image btw
[04:55:36] <lz_> my assumption about the whole double emails thing was that thunderbird would store a copy in the "sent" folder, and hotmail would do the same, hence the double emails. I'm just very confused as to why webmail is showing this weird outlook_[guid]@outlook.com email instead of the gmail address of the recipient
[04:55:55] <bpmedley> lz_ : So, what you are saying is that the "From" field of the 1st received message does not match the "To" field of the 1st reply?
[04:56:42] <bpmedley> lz_ : Which MIME header has outlook_[guid] in the 1st received message?
[04:56:51] <lz_> bpmedley: the image is a sent message, not a received one. Sent message 2nd copy doesn't show a "To" that matches what I sent the email to
[04:57:18] <lz_> bpmedley: i don't have any MIME header that shows the guid thing. Guid thing only shows in webmail, which doesn't let me show the source of sent messages

[05:00:02] <bpmedley> So, when you download sent messages in Thunderbird you don't get any "outlook_[guid]" message?
[05:00:16] <lz_> indeed i don't
[05:00:34] <lz_> that's why i was starting to wonder if my thunderbird was compromised
[05:00:47] <bpmedley> My bad, I misunderstood, I would download MailKit and fetch the IMAP messages in your Sent folder and do a validation that way.
[05:01:04] <_genuser_> bpmedley going big boy on this problem!
[05:01:22] <lz_> bpmedley: to rule out a problem with thunderbird you mean? I'll do that, thanks
[05:01:32] <bpmedley> _genuser_ : Not so much, just bored..
[05:01:40] <lz_> eventhough at this point I think it's just outlook doing outlook shit
[05:02:00] <_genuser_> bpmedley I mean I like it! I appreciate suggestions like this from community when someone has a question.
[05:02:03] <bpmedley> lz_ : The more I think about it, the more I think it's outlook phantoms
[05:02:38] <bpmedley> _genuser_ : Perhaps I misunderstood what "big boy" meant.  I assumed you were saying I suspected a huge issue..
[05:02:41] <_genuser_> hotmail should also have login audits. somewhere microsoft account should have login audits. You can verify that too to check if any logins were done from outside your account.
[05:02:58] <_genuser_> bpmedley heh, I just mean bring serious tools to the situation.
[05:03:21] <_genuser_> bpmedley you know something more than, "oh enable 2fa and change your password"
[05:03:34] <bpmedley> Fair enough, writing some custom code this really is "big boy".. :-0
[05:04:28] <lz_> i wonder, shouldn't i just use another install from thunderbird in another machine and check i get the same thing?
[05:04:38] <_genuser_> bpmedley lol for my monitor issue, I'm just thinking of buying a new GPU.
[05:04:48] <bpmedley> _genuser_ : I have no clue on that one
[05:05:05] <_genuser_> bpmedley I don't either, so I'm looking at GPU prices on amazon.
[05:05:14] <_genuser_> $150'ish might be worth less hassle in time wasted.
[05:05:14] <bpmedley> Isn't that frustrating?
[05:05:36] <_genuser_> what is? shopping for a new one?
[05:06:00] <bpmedley> No, it's frustrating lacking introspection into our hardware and software stuff..
[05:06:09] <bpmedley> Or, at least, I don't know how really..
[05:06:56] <_genuser_> bpmedley it's also annoying to see the radeon software... what the driver actually allows. hotkeys to enable recording the last few seconds of your "gameplay". So technically it's able to record the screen output anytime it wants.
[05:08:12] <_genuser_> bpmedley record and save as gif or as video. streaming abilities built into radeon settings software. If I download something like OBS or a streaming software suite, that would be understandable. This seems to be just able to record last few secons of gameplay without having to launch a screen recording software first.
[05:09:00] <lz_> my new theory: 1st copy of the email is the one stored by thunderbird; 2nd copy is the one stored by hotmail. Hotmail figured out the recipient (who has a gmail address) has registered an outlook account with this address, so it shows this weird garbage. I think I'm fine with this explanation
[05:09:27] <lz_> I can't reproduce this with my own gmail address because I never registered an outlook account with it
[05:09:32] <bpmedley> lz_ : You have one sent message represented differently by different software products?
[05:09:35] <_genuser_> althought that's a huge privacy violation to auto associate one account with another.
[05:09:57] <lz_> bpmedley: i only tested in thunderbird, but as i mentioned this machine is completely, completely isolated. never installed shit on it
[05:10:30] <bpmedley> lz_ : Makes sense, however, did I understand you correctly?  There is only one IMAP message and each client is viewing them differently?
[05:11:05] <lz_> no there are 2 imap messages (the 2 copies of the same sent email); both shows the same on thunderbird, but show differently on webmail
[05:11:24] <bpmedley> I see.  That's some craziness, lz_ ..
[05:11:45] <lz_> i suspect 1st copy was made by thunderbird and 2nd one by outlook. outlook shows more info than thunderbird knows because of that supposed outlook account the recipient would have made with their gmail address
[05:12:19] <bpmedley> lz_ : Did you respond to one message in Thunderbird and another message in webmail?
[05:12:45] <lz_> bpmedley: if i reply on webmail, there's only 1 copy and no weird outlook stuff, only gmail as expected
[05:13:35] <bpmedley> I'm not understanding what 1st copy was made by thunderbird and 2nd one by outlook.
[05:13:39] <bpmedley> Is outlook the webmail?
[05:13:45] <lz_> yes
[05:14:20] <lz_> when i said "2nd one by outlook", i mean by the mail server
[05:14:43] <lz_> he saw some message being sent and probably said "hey i'm gonna store this in the sent folder", whereas thunderbird already did it
[05:14:55] <bpmedley> Did Thunderbird use IMAP?
[05:15:04] <lz_> or some thunderbird bug. yes it's using imap
[05:15:48] <lz_> sorry this is all very confusing
[05:16:05] <bpmedley> I know of 0 IMAP clients or webmail that will monitor the sent message folder and manage them for other clients stored messages.
[05:16:40] <lz_> bpmedley: tbh this really sounds like a bug
[05:16:44] <bpmedley> I could be wrong, but a webmail client fetching new messages from the Sent folder and then creating an almost duplicate feels strange.
[05:16:48] <lz_> but i'd rather it be a bug than a hack
[05:17:05] *** Quits: DrowningElysium (uid190788@user/drowningelysium) (Quit: Connection closed for inactivity)
[05:17:22] <lz_> bpmedley: no no, i don't thinkt he webclient did it. I think that sth is wrong when thunderbird actually sends the message and copies it. I think the 2nd copy happens at that stage, not sure how
[05:18:53] <bpmedley> lz_ :  So, you feel that there are two stored copies of the IMAP message by Thunderbird?
[05:18:58] <lz_> bpmedley: quick google search https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1189261
[05:19:21] <lz_> bpmedley: i was not worried about the copies, seems legit. only the weird infos that showed on webmail
[05:19:50] <bpmedley> lz_ : Are you using outlook.com's SMTP server?
[05:20:32] <lz_> yeah smtp-mail.outlook.com
[05:21:04] <bpmedley> So, one IMAP message is stored after the SMTP server and another is specifically stored by Thunderbird?
[05:21:15] <lz_> I think that's something like it
[05:21:41] <bpmedley> If so, then there are two different IMAP clients storing messages.  No clue how each will end up on the server or how clients will interpret them..
[05:21:54] <bpmedley> lz_ : I'm happy with that, if you are..
[05:22:27] <lz_> bpmedley: as i said i was not worried about the 2 copies. only the weird outlook_[guid]@outlook.com that showed for a recipient that was supposed to be a gmail one
[05:22:49] <bpmedley> lz_ : Well, different IMAP clients could send slightly different MIME email messages.
[05:23:55] <lz_> i'm still not sure i could explain everything right lol
[05:24:25] <lz_> bpmedley: the webmail i use is actually outlook, if that was your question earlier. of course it's not going to do weird things
[05:24:27] <bpmedley> Because the most probable scenario is that the email sent via SMTP is placed in the IMAP Sent folder via an IMAP client.
[05:24:59] <lz_> bpmedley: you mean an imap client that isn't mine? the mozilla link above shows that thunderbird is responsible for it
[05:25:06] <lz_> and that can be disabled
[05:25:32] <bpmedley> lz_ : Well, what I'm asking is by what method is the outlook.com's SMTP message being placed in your Sent folder.
[05:25:41] <lz_> scenario 1: i send an email with thunderbird, chaos ensues. if I use hotmail.com directly, it's fine
[05:26:22] <lz_> in scenario 1, i get the garbage in my sent folder: 2 copies instead of one, but that's apparently fine and can be disabled in thunderbird settings
[05:26:36] <lz_> the super weird thing was how one of those 2 copies showed up on hotmail.com
[05:26:54] <bpmedley> lz_ : However, my question was: "by what method does the SMTP message be stored in the IMAP Sent folder".
[05:27:18] <lz_> i read that question like 3 times but i don't think i know the answer :D
[05:27:26] <lz_> i'm not sure what it even means
[05:27:46] <lz_> my answers were the closest i could get to answering it without understanding
[05:28:01] <bpmedley> lz_ : Rereading, my question may be badly worded.
[05:28:29] <bpmedley> For clarity, do SMTP servers usually add sent messages into an IMAP Sent folder?
[05:28:47] <lz_> I think so, that's why there's an option to disable thunderbird doing it too
[05:29:51] <bpmedley> I feel that most SMTP servers do not do so.  So, there is custom code on outlook.com's email system that implicitly stores all sent messages into the IMAP Sent folder.
[05:31:12] <lz_> why would that message show differently in thunderbird and outlook webmail, still a mistery. I guess outlook webmail does a bit more work to avoid creating that guid trash
[05:31:17] <bpmedley> What if the mail store was not IMAP?  Could the SMTP server and the MDA be that intertwined?
[05:32:12] <lz_> i think everything is imap
[05:32:46] <lz_> and the 2nd weird copy misses some metadata that tells the outlook webmail not to go and fetch stuff from its outlook accounts

[05:33:11] <lz_> or something
[05:33:44] <bpmedley> I personally feel that the issue is related to encoding the SMTP message by different software applications.
[05:34:59] <lz_> well that's what i was trying to say: the webmail outlook client does stuff nicely as it expects stuff to be, and thunderbird isn't doing all outlook was expecting
[05:35:31] <lz_> because outlook guys probably imagines people only would ever use outlook
[05:35:59] <bpmedley> lz_ : Makes sense.  Thanks for sharing.  I am basically satisfied with the scenario we arrived at, what about you?
[05:36:34] <lz_> bpmedley: sort of :D but I'm really happy you helped
[05:36:51] <bpmedley> lz_ : What other questions or thoughts have you got?
[05:37:18] <lz_> bpmedley: the recipient could probably tell me if they have an outlook account registered with their gmail address, I think that'll probably settle it

[12:41:09] <Jonopoly> I'm using 3 seperate linq calls to grab ids from an object left
[12:41:22] <Jonopoly> and i'm wondering if it is possible to unify it
[12:41:25] <Jonopoly> https://pastecode.io/s/dzprhdoj
[12:44:33] <Babbage> there different things arent they?
[12:45:19] <Babbage> one is 3 lists of unique staff, students, assistance, the other is a matrix of every possible combination of those 3 wich each combination being unique?
[12:46:20] <canton7> Jonopoly, .Concat, but you'll get different results if you use a single .Distinct vs multiple calls to .Distinct
[12:47:13] <Suchiman> Jonopoly: School.ClassRoom.SelectMany(e => new[] { e.Student_ID, e.Staff_ID, e.Assistant_ID }).Distinct().ToList() would work but it's not pretty :P
[12:49:14] <Jonopoly> Suchiman: how come that's not pretty? looks alright
[12:49:23] <Suchiman> (i mean i guess it kinda is pretty but it allocates an intermediate array for every ClassRoom)
[12:49:32] <Jonopoly> and less than multiple lines
[12:49:37] <Jonopoly> Ohh okay
[12:50:01] <Suchiman> hehe but then again your sample code also isn't as efficient as it could be :P
[12:50:26] <canton7> var c = School.ClassRoom; var IDList = c.Select(x => x.Student_ID).Concat(c.Select(x => x.Staff_ID)).Concat(c.Select(x => x.Assistant_ID)).Distinct().ToList()
[12:50:34] <canton7> But, that's slightly different to your current code
[12:50:54] <Suchiman> canton7: is it? should have the same results
[12:51:01] *** Joins: vim_fans_ (~pi@user/vim-fans/x-3284168)
[12:51:03] <canton7> In that in yours, if a student and a staff have the same ID, you'll get both in the result
[12:51:12] <Suchiman> ah... yeah
[12:51:52] <Jonopoly> But can't you use distinct() ?
[12:52:17] <Suchiman> Jonopoly: the difference is how distinct is being used between your sample and canton7's code
[12:52:49] <Suchiman> Jonopoly: your sample applies distinct only between Student_ID's and Staff_ID's, etc. individually while canton7's applies it globally once
[12:52:51] <canton7> Your code is: var c = School.ClassRoom; var IDList = c.Select(x => x.Student_ID).Distinct().Concat(c.Select(x => x.Staff_ID).Distinct()).Concat(c.Select(x => x.Assistant_ID).Distinct()).ToList()

[13:03:08] <Jonopoly> Well I guess both are better than how i was originally doing it haha
[13:03:31] <Jonopoly> I've got one later that has 7 Id Properties it needs to grab
[13:03:50] <Jonopoly> So i'm hoping I can use Suchiman sample or canton7 sample
[13:03:51] <canton7> You could write a helper method
[13:03:57] <canton7> That'll save a bunch of boilerplate
[13:04:39] <canton7> School.ClassRoom.Grab(x => x.Student_ID, x => x.Staff_ID, x => x.Assistant_ID).Distinct()

[13:06:33] <Jonopoly> But what if its different properties/objects
[13:07:07] <edcba> well you can't distinct different things ?
[13:07:24] <canton7> Or put them in a list. So you must be dealing with the same type across all of those properties
[13:08:21] *** Quits: vim_fans_ (~pi@user/vim-fans/x-3284168) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[13:13:09] <edcba> anyway having the same type to refer to different kind of entities is bad imo
[13:13:42] <edcba> you are not far having a teacher becoming a student
[13:14:44] <xb0o2> Insert some proverb about life long learning here
[13:14:50] <Jonopoly> haha
[13:19:06] <Jonopoly> canton7: I don't suppose you'd know a helper method so handle:
[13:19:08] <Jonopoly> List<int> sample = School.ClassRoom.Grab(e => new ( e.Student_ID, e.Staff_ID, e.Assistant_ID ).ToList()
[13:19:22] <Jonopoly> That would return distinct list of ints
[13:19:53] <canton7> What type is being instantiated by the 'new' there
[13:20:33] <Jonopoly> :( new list of ints?
[13:20:59] <canton7> That's basically the same as Suchiman's thing? You'll create a ton of new array of ints
[13:21:13] <Jonopoly> Oh yeah, sorry my bad

[16:12:20] <interop_madness> Every Russian expat celebrity who doesn't speak out now against Putin is the mortal enemy and should be brutally kicked out.
[16:12:25] <pandem> is that too much?

[16:13:49] <interop_madness> Oh, I absolutely am for compelling speech in this case
[16:13:52] <interop_madness> We're at war.
[16:14:19] <pandem> well, technically we are not
[16:14:22] <pandem> but not far off
[16:14:27] <interop_madness> There was no freedom of speech for Axis Sally and Tokyo Rose either (luckily)
[16:14:48] <pandem> i'm not a big fan of cancel culture either, but i dont think it's bad now
[16:14:54] <pandem> maybe i'm a hypocrite, idk
[16:15:00] <interop_madness> No, that's not cancel culture
[16:15:09] <bomb> Russia invaded Georgia in 2008, Ukraine in 2014, Syria and Libya recently. why are we at war this time?
[16:15:15] <interop_madness> Cancel culture is when the punishment stands in no relation to the infraction
[16:15:41] <interop_madness> We're at war because it is the first "proper" war on European soil since 1945
[16:16:16] <bomb> lol
[16:16:34] <interop_madness> Regardless, it seems Putin has miscalculated and seriously thoght the EU would just bicker a little and impose no stiff sanctions
[16:16:40] <pandem> it's a bit different scale
[16:17:02] <interop_madness> Yet.
[16:17:13] <pandem> syria is probably comparable scale though

[16:17:27] <pandem> but at least for me as a european i care more about wars in europe
[16:18:19] <bomb> Putin already won the war. all this "we're at war" news going on in media is because USA wants European countries to boost their military spending.
[16:18:42] <megaTherion> bomb: Putin wants to attack all european countries basically, this is just the first war in his plan
[16:18:57] <interop_madness> It will be interesting how China will react in the mid-long run to Russia

[16:23:27] <interop_madness> He won't win any other way, Ukrainians have made clear that they would even continue to fight after a nuclear attack

[16:24:31] <interop_madness> Yes, but only if Putin commits severe war crimes and genocide pandem
[16:24:41] <pandem> guerilla war would continue after surrender
[16:24:41] <megaTherion> many people have answered the call, they dont want to wait until baltic states are being attacked
[16:25:09] <megaTherion> pandem: I dont think we should care so much for words or contracts, Putin did break all kind of contracts - we cannot deal with him
[16:25:16] <BSaboia> I don't think that Russia can ever "win" this war. In the militar aspect, maybe. But politically, certainly not
[16:25:25] <bomb> interop_madness Ukraine war is going on in pro-Russian areas of Ukraine, except Kiev
[16:25:27] <megaTherion> so how we will call this state of war... is not relevant, EU will not recognize Ukraine or krim being part of russian federation
[16:25:45] <BSaboia> megaTherion, including the one that Russia would never attack Ukraine after they gave up the nuclear arsenal in the middle 1990's
[16:25:48] <interop_madness> bomb, "pro-russian" is increasingly relative these days
[16:25:53] <bomb> interop_madness and Russia is going to siege Kiev, blocking western supply. nobody can fight without food and ammo
[16:25:55] <interop_madness> Putins support is crumbling even in Russia
[16:25:57] <megaTherion> BSaboia: exacly
[16:26:09] <megaTherion> russia needs to surrender now and give up nuclear weapons, I dont see any other way out of this
[16:26:33] <megaTherion> I hope that someone in russian military/leadership kills putin and takes over the power and begin diplomatic communications
[16:26:34] <bomb> interop_madness quite the opposite. sanctions against Russian people, like credit cards not working, etc. actually boosts Putin's domestic support
[16:27:01] <pandem> sometimes it might, i dont think this is the case
[16:27:10] <megaTherion> bomb: not completly, putin forgot that this internet thing exists - young people know whats going on
[16:27:17] <bomb> interop_madness that's where I thought the miscalculation is going on. financial sanctions against a state is important, but against people... it would only backfire.
[16:27:58] <interop_madness> bomb, the people will learn that all they have to do is to remove Putin for their troubles to end

[16:28:29] <bomb> interop_madness you think Russian people was fan of Putin? it's so called "oligarchs" that keep Putin in command for decades, not the democracy.
[16:28:31] <interop_madness> Solidarity is a "had food within the last three days" topic
[16:28:53] <interop_madness> The oligarchs have started speaking out against him. At least 2-3 as of now
[16:29:00] <megaTherion> yeah they are loosing their money

[16:29:05] <interop_madness> Which is unprecedented (except for Chodorkowsky)
[16:29:57] <megaTherion> bomb: they will learn it, its not just the USA - almost all countries are against this war
[16:30:06] <megaTherion> (except maybe China, which only basically says - war is bad, but we stay out of this)
[16:30:36] <bomb> megaTherion time is running against Ukrainian people. they're running out of resources. in contrast, Russia has a plenty of resources
[16:30:55] <bomb> megaTherion it's likely that Zelensky will lose support than Putin
[16:31:03] <megaTherion> bomb: resources are useless and russia doesnt have all resources required to continue to wage war against europe - only fuel oil and stuff
[16:31:14] <megaTherion> bomb: absolutly not, Putin is horrible unpopular
[16:31:34] <bomb> megaTherion you clearly don't have many Russian friends

[16:33:04] <interop_madness> Well they say they're doing ok^^
[16:33:10] <megaTherion> if you say "okay" equals "leader is fat and wealthy" - you dont have a clue

[16:33:34] <pandem> all my friends from russia are from the top universities of the country and even most of them supported him
[16:33:55] <megaTherion> pandem: does this mean they support this war?
[16:34:04] <bomb> megaTherion you're just supporting my argument, are you aware that? North Korea is doing okay even though the people are starving
[16:34:19] <pandem> probably not
[16:34:20] <megaTherion> bomb: thats an oxymoron
[16:34:27] <megaTherion> you cannt "do okay" and starve at the same time
[16:34:40] <pandem> but even over the years if the young and educated people supported him it's kinda scary
[16:34:54] <pandem> it's the opposite in turkey, everyone that's young and educated opposes erdogan
[16:34:58] <bomb> megaTherion you're an oxymoron. you claimed russians will remove Putin because of the sanctions, I proved it wrong, and you actually agreed on this.
[16:34:59] <megaTherion> pandem: its their choice....
[16:35:13] <pandem> ok?

[16:47:18] <Jonopoly> https://pastebin.com/3af339uF
[16:47:44] <Jonopoly> Error CS1503: Argument 1: cannot convert from 'System.Collections.Generic.List<int>' to 'System.Collections.Generic.List<int?>'
[16:47:54] <Jonopoly> I thought it wouldn't matter what type i put in
[16:48:54] <shadowchaser> TeacherFemail;)
[16:49:02] <Jonopoly> haha, sorry typo
[16:49:06] <jonp> Jonopoly: `int` != `int?`
[16:49:12] <Jonopoly> I usually have to re-write my problem
[16:49:17] <jonp> `int?` is a "short form" for `Nullable<int>`
[16:49:19] <canton7> Jonopoly, TeacherAssistant1_ID is an 'int', so your 'Grab(...).ToList()' is returning a 'List<int>'. But you're then trying to turn that into a 'List<int?>'. That's not going to work -- an 'int?' is bigger than an 'int', because it needs an extra bit of data to say whether it's null or not
[16:49:35] <Jonopoly> Ah okay
[16:49:51] <Jonopoly> Right, so i can do something like
[16:50:02] <Jonopoly> (a => a.Teacher_ID ?? 0)
[16:50:08] <canton7> Jonopoly, you can do 'x => (int?)x.TeacherAssistant1_ID', or you can do 'Grab<int, int?>(...)'
[16:50:27] <pandem> why is the idlist not List<int>
[16:50:42] <canton7> Jonopoly, that's backwards? Teacher_ID is an int, not an int?. So the '?? 0' is meaningless, since the 'Teacher_ID' can't be null anyway
[16:53:24] <Jonopoly> canton7, jonp: thanks!
[16:53:37] <Jonopoly> I'll just cast the lists where id is nullable
[16:53:46] <Jonopoly> to ints
[16:54:02] <canton7> Jonopoly, I don't follow
[16:54:14] <canton7> Jonopoly, the only nullable ints in that snippet is the List<int?>, which you introduced
[16:54:56] <Jonopoly> rider says it returns IEnumerable<int?>
[16:55:21] <Jonopoly> so i used the list<int?> instead of var
[16:55:28] <pandem> just use var
[16:55:33] <Jonopoly> Some of those ID can be nullable though
[16:55:34] <canton7> Jonopoly, the compiler error you posted suggests differently. It's failing to cast a List<int> to a List<int?>, and the only List<int> in that code is the one returned by ToList()
[16:56:41] <canton7> Jonopoly, and that can only happen if the delegates being passed to Grab are Func<Whatever, int>.
[16:57:19] <canton7> ... Which can only happen if the IDs aren't nullable

[17:02:56] <hseg> ok, then I'm in a catch22

[20:28:50] <GunArm> specifically meaning I give it the object that it's supposed to serialize for me (*i think.....*) and then the request is being made with no post content at all
[20:30:07] <GunArm> if I use the debugger and open the response message and look at it's members, I can see respMsg.RequestMsg.Content.Value is my object with it's properties
[20:30:45] <GunArm> am I missing something I need to do to make it actually send the content of the post?

[20:45:01] <eurogos> DevJohnC, is a software kvm any good?
[20:45:12] <alguien> From the docs: "For SUTs that still use the Web Host, the test app's builder.ConfigureServices callback is executed before the SUT's Startup.ConfigureServices code. The test app's builder.ConfigureTestServices callback is executed after.".
[20:45:23] <alguien> before Startup.ConfigureServices adds S as the DbContext, when I request a DbContext from the service provider after all that, I get W, not S. That would make sense if ServiceProvider.GetService returned the last service added (doesn't it return the first one added though?), but IServiceProvider.GetServices<DbContext>() only returns one element! I don't get it.
[20:45:47] <alguien> oops, my second line is missing the start of the sentence:

[20:49:29] <GunArm> but the reason I spent a day and a half so far trying to make PostAsJsonAsync to work is I wanted to use some syntax that was only in dotnet core, so fewer people will take this sample code and use it on .net framework and then try to get us to support that
[20:49:47] <alguien> subsequently = after the call to WebHostBuilder.ConfigureServices, and before getting the service from the ServiceProvider

[22:51:30] <BinarySavior> Hi I have a table in MS SQL db with just two fields, id and label.  There's only 4 rows in this table.   I want to populate a RadListBox with the those four rows
[22:51:42] <BinarySavior> I'm using Telerik and wpf
[22:52:16] <BinarySavior> Where do I start?
[22:52:16] <lz_> from a very very broad perspective, I think bombs are likely to explode at some point. 2nd law of thermodynamics etc
[22:52:40] <lz_> just like a glass will fall, etc
[22:53:08] <BinarySavior> Yea, statistically anything that *can* happen *will* happen if enough time passes
[22:53:36] <Suchiman> BinarySavior: do you have any connection between the application and the database already?
[22:53:58] <Suchiman> .NET (Core) or .NET Framework? is the database on the same machine?
[22:54:03] <BinarySavior> Suchiman yes, my colleague set all the connections up
[22:54:03] <lz_> BinarySavior: 2nd law is not exactly that. more like, entropy increases, and things that are low entropy are likely to be affected
[22:54:08] <BinarySavior> it's .Net Core
[22:54:32] <Suchiman> BinarySavior: what is being used? raw ADO.NET? Dapper? EF Core?
[22:54:33] <lz_> BinarySavior: it's true that even unlikely things can happen, but i was talking about likely things

[22:57:10] <BinarySavior> Okay I found the context file he created
[22:57:15] <BinarySavior> I will look into this t hank you
[22:58:23] <BinarySavior> lz_ I think starvation and mass civil unrest due to climate disasters is far more likely than nuclear war
[22:59:25] <lz_> why not both
[22:59:55] <lz_> note that climate change is also linked to 2nd law of thermodynamics: all this fuel and coal was likely to burn
[23:00:21] <BinarySavior> if nuclear attack happens I would assume nuclear retaliation will also occur which will surely kill enough people that the climate change would be reversed

[23:02:25] <bomb> wonderful news
[23:02:48] <lz_> blezz: apparently not. nuclear winter would last "only" 1 to 4 years, prolly not enough for a reverse at a bigger scale
[23:03:05] <lz_> so the effects would probably add up
[23:03:55] <BinarySavior> after nuclear war I think the entire global supply chain would be overhauled, domestic infrastructure would be overhauled, systems would be built to scale and account for climate impact
