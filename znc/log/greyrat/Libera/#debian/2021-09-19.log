[00:08:49] <johnjay> it's nice if config files all have regular syntax ideally
[00:09:27] <alkisg> sudo allows me to allow users to run a single command as admins. It's very very handy
[00:12:12] <johnjay> i've never really understood that since it destroys the separation of user from root
[00:12:24] <johnjay> but idk i don't make the rules i just sudo apt-get here
[00:13:22] <Khepra> johnjay: it doesn't. you need special permissions to run sudo. and then you can granularly permit some root's actions without giving keys to the kingdom.
[00:17:50] <Blondie101010> Mr_Queue:  indeed, sudo tracks everything that is done by real UID session

[00:36:09] <gspbirel56> I just wanted to ask before installing. I know Pop!_OS has out of the box support but it isn't as good as vanilla Ubuntu. That said, I think I would prefer Debian on this machine if I can get my graphics card to work on it

[01:02:21] <sney> cryptic "access denied" / "not permitted" errors can be apparmor related, are you using anything other than the default apparmor configuration?
[01:02:46] <Khepra> Sokomine: init=/lib/sysvinit/init  really?
[01:03:05] <Khepra> so no systemd-logind to handle the session? is there elogind involved?
[01:04:24] <Sokomine> no indication of elogind. the system has been upgraded over years
[01:04:57] <Sokomine> if i ran into any problems with apparmor some years ago with the last update, i may have changed something. but i don't consciously remember
[01:05:04] <Khepra> then I'd say your system is broken. you're using sysv init judging by the logged cmdline, which means no systemd-logind to handle the session
[01:05:35] *** Joins: kathenas (~kathenas@2a02:c7f:e512:a500:5e87:9cff:fe0a:a66d)
[01:05:36] <Khepra> so for starters, check if that's sysv or systemd system, and confirm that cmdline log in xorg's log is factually correct
[01:07:28] <Sokomine> systemd is at least to some degree involved i'd say, although i'm not 100% sure. just did the update a few days ago. with the old 4.x kernel x was still starting. now switched to the 5.x and it doesn't anymore
[01:08:10] <Sokomine> i start x still with  "startx &" on the command line
[01:08:42] <Khepra> Sokomine: it can't be "to some degree" involved. either it is, or isn't pid1. do you actually have /lib/sysvinit/init and is that pid1?
[01:09:29] <Blondie101010> ps -f -p 1
[01:09:46] <Sokomine> the *file* /lib/sysvinit/init still exists.   root           1       0  0 21:50 ?        00:00:00 init [2]
[01:10:09] <Blondie101010> so no systemd
[01:10:09] <Khepra> Sokomine: so check with Blondie101010's command
[01:10:32] <Khepra> ah you did
[01:10:41] <Sokomine> ah: init [2] SHLVL=1 HOME=/ init=/lib/sysvinit/init TER
[01:11:04] <Sokomine> that wasn't sufficient either. had to provide  exe as param to see which one it was
[01:11:12] <Khepra> yeah, without systemd as pid1, systemd-logind won't work. you don't have session management for xorg, which requires logind. not sure how you could get in that state accidentally :)
[01:11:37] <Blondie101010> he apparently tried many things manually
[01:11:47] <Sokomine> time? :-) perhaps even deliberately in the past. don't want x to start automaticly and may have done something against that
[01:12:27] <Sokomine> i've even been working with the console for years and only switched to x when i couldn't avoid that anymore
[01:12:40] *** Quits: fcinq (~irc@network.g33k.host) (Remote host closed the connection)
[01:12:59] <Khepra> I mean, it's not possible for xorg to start via startx without logind seat handling permissions. it's not possible you had that setup for buster. so it must've happened during/after upgrade, by removing systemd and adding init to grub cmdline, during which time xorg wouldnt' work at all
[01:13:44] <Khepra> well, that's factually incorrect; you _can_ startx if you _manually_ fix permissions in /dev, which you'd have to do on boot, or toy with ACLs or udev rules

[01:14:21] <Khepra> but then you'd be very much aware of that and this problem wouldn't've been unsolvable
[01:14:40] <Sokomine> grub cmdline - could be that something went wrong there. the system didn't boot after updating, and i eventually edited my grub.cfg manually by taking the params from the old 4.16.x or so version

[01:15:47] <Khepra> and that's what I'm saying. if you had sysv init on buster, then xorg would still fail to startx unless you manually fidgeted with permissions in /dev
[01:16:31] <Khepra> so now, you'd need to assess your current state of the system, and bring it up to proper systemd configuration
[01:17:23] <Sokomine> seems reasonable. i very likely didn't do that back on buster. at least not deliberately. but apt-get upgrade didn't complain much either (nothing serious at least; went pretty smooth)

[01:19:34] <Sokomine> it just surprises me that the kernel makes a difference
[01:19:49] <Khepra> I don't think the kernel here has anything to do with this
[01:20:13] <Blondie101010> I suggest you stop wasting time on explaining what happened and start fixing it
[01:20:50] <Khepra> that permission failure is due to inability to write into /dev/dri/somwehere, because the session management didn't permit your user access to those

[02:04:51] <Sokomine> tjcarter: accidentally had init=/lib/sysvinit/init in my grub.conf and was wondering why startx refuesd to start
[02:06:01] <tjcarter> oh
[02:06:04] <Sokomine> the older kernel with the (supposedly...) same parameters worked fine :-) just not the one with the wrong ones....
[02:06:15] <Khepra> but didn't you also have sysvinit-core instead of systemd?
[02:06:42] <Sokomine> guess that's a remaining transitional package from old times? perhaps the reinstall helped
[02:07:36] <Sokomine> without that old package it probably wouldn't have booted at all with that parameter. but apart from x most things (like i.e. irc, lynx and so on) worked just fine
[02:08:15] <tjcarter> yeah I don't see that file in current (at least sid) Contents …
[02:09:16] <Sokomine> it's a system that got updated over at least two generations of debian. perhaps more. i might have reinstalled from scratch sometimes in the past due to a new disk
[02:09:17] <tjcarter> Sokomine: are you using sysvinit at all or should the system have started with systemd
[02:10:05] <Sokomine> it should have started with systemd. but apparently quite a lot (apart from x or things i didn't miss immediately) still works with sysvinit. that's quite impressive
[02:10:26] <Sokomine> well, ok, mostly tested console programs and nothing that'd affect either much
[02:12:09] <Khepra> technically even xorg/startx woudl work without systemd if you managed permissions manually
[02:12:40] <tjcarter> Debian's last words on systemd vs. anything else were that systemd is that it will maintain compatibility with non-systemd where possible and not preclude something better coming along later, but that systemd is the default and they're not going to hamstring it to make old stuff work.
[02:12:53] <somiaj> Debian had supported both systemd and sysvinit for a while, and I suspect most will keep sysvinit scripts around that are working
[02:13:23] <tjcarter> That's both in line with and a great departure from its previous outlook of make all of the above work.
[02:13:36] <tjcarter> As long as they all reasonable can work, they will.
[02:14:21] <Khepra> which unfortunately makes many things not take advantage of systemd fully  --  but thankfully, that's simply fixable with proper configuration.
[02:14:42] <somiaj> I think it also gives maintainers a bit more freedom
[02:14:47] <tjcarter> Khepra: Debian's old policy definitely had that effect.
[02:15:14] <somiaj> It was a lot of work to have to support multiple init systems in some packages

[02:18:46] <Khepra> at least the new GR doesn't say you _have_ to support multiple inits. unless I misunderstood it, a maintainer can write fully systemd specific service configuration

[02:22:46] <tjcarter> somiaj: I have little desire to support non-systemd systems not because I like systemd—I basically tolerate it at best—but because the rage against systemd has caused those doing the raging to make it virtually impossible to detect the "not systemd" case in any kind of generalized way.
[02:22:49] <somiaj> Sokomine: I personally found systemd nicer than sysvinit, just easier to write my own services, and easier to debug things.
[02:23:32] <tjcarter> I can do it on Debian systems, sure, but general cases are needed, not system-specific ones.
[02:23:39] <somiaj> tjcarter: my only major complaint about systemd is not runtime modular, it is compile time modular, so Debian can't let the users easily configure which of all of its modules they may or may not want.
[02:24:52] <Khepra> s/want\./want present on the system, but otherwise can decide what does or doesn't run, save journald/

[02:27:54] <Khepra> but but but! systemd-timesyncd was separated out into its own package for bullseye. nspawn already is too. logind makes little sense to separate. journald is unfortunately baked into pid1. so that leaves resolved. upcoming homed will hopefully also be separate
[02:28:28] <tjcarter> I actually removed syslogd
[02:28:32] <Khepra> oh yeah, and networkd; though I'm using it, so meh
[02:28:48] <tjcarter> if I have to put up with journald anyway, I might as well just use it
[02:29:17] <Khepra> I'm running one system wihtout syslogd. oh man after 20+ years that feels terribly weird. I can _feel_ the gap.
[02:29:51] <Khepra> tjcarter: I prefer(ed) using journald as short, 100M volatile in-memory buffer, and have the rest rsylsog'd into files, and remoted to the logserver, wher it makes sense
[02:30:15] <Khepra> it's not a XOR situation really. journald can be minimized to stay out of the way

[02:37:05] <tjcarter> where no syslog makes sense is on a small home machine that's not part of a larger network. Such a machine doesn't really need to run a syslogd really, but it would help if logs were available if something went wrong. In fact a home machine is greatly improved overall using systemd in place of … all the traditional UNIX servers, really.
[02:39:43] <joepublic> plus, this gives the home user the opportunity to forget decades of experience and learn the exciting, new "systemd way" to do things.  it's a win-win.
[02:39:58] <Khepra> how... relevant is the myth about rotated corrupt journald files? I've heard that a lot as argument against journald, but in practice did that happen to anyone, and how serious is it?
[02:41:15] <Khepra> (I don't do non-data-checksummed filesystems so "corrupt data" is an alient term to me  *snicker* )
[02:41:16] <tjcarter> joepublic: that's not necessarily a benefit 😛
[02:41:36] * Khepra hands tjcarter new batteries for the sarcasm detector
[02:42:09] <tjcarter> I actually think "learning new things" CAN be beneficial
[02:42:35] <tjcarter> if the new way is genuinely an improvement over the old way … but often systemd is a wash on that. It's not better, just different.
[02:42:57] <Khepra> "you don't say!"   I think you meant "learning new things"  vs   "learning new things without also learning the past"
[02:44:24] <Khepra> systemd is solving real, actual problems. now, it may do so with certain design flaws, but that's a separate issue.  a properly designed replacement could still retain , maybe not all but substantial, compatibility with systemd

[06:47:11] <somiaj> again look at the output of mount to see the details
[06:48:42] <Na_Klar> anyways, the question is if /run/shm is a real ramdisk or is on a partition on the hdd.
[06:48:42] <Na_Klar> mount -l just gives the file system. it is not clear to me if "tmpfs on /run/shm typ tmpfs" has the information I search for.
[06:50:42] <somiaj> tmpfs on /run type tmpfs (rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime,size=3274148k,mode=755) -- It has a fixed size, though not sure what you mean by real ramdisk
[06:51:05] <somiaj> but if you mean 'ramfs', not it is clearly tmpfs
[06:51:30] <Na_Klar> a ramdisk is a "virtual" device which is completely located in the ram.

[10:31:16] <willow> i would get rid of NetworkManager however it's very useful for managing the wireless interface
[10:31:22] <somiaj> I know networkmanager will nicely ignore things in the interfaces file, but might not be aware of netword (unsure here)
[10:31:42] <somiaj> willow: I prefer wpa_gui for that, but anyways, you should be able to tell network manager to ignore a device if it isn't ignoring it already
[10:32:14] <somiaj> though I could see issues with network manager wanting to set up resolv.conf for the wireless device and conflicting with resolved, you might want to check out resolvconf or openresolv
[10:32:37] <willow> it appears to be ignoring it
[10:33:06] <willow> it appears to not bring up the wireless interface when it detects that the ethernet is already up
[10:33:46] <willow> cool will check out wpa_gui
[10:34:20] <somiaj> it is part of wpasupplicant
[10:34:32] <somiaj> I manage my wired card and wifi through my interfaces file
[10:34:52] <somiaj> and just use wpasupplicant in roam mode setup throught eh interfaces file, and wpa_gui is a gui tool to change networks
[10:35:13] <somiaj> check out /usr/share/doc/wpasupplicant/ for some good docs on setting this up in the interfaces file (though seems you want to go networkd which I know little about)

[10:36:23] <willow> 👍 thank you
[10:38:57] <willow> it is tricky, because i don't think you actually want networkmanager to completely ignore the ethernet.  it needs to be aware of it in order to know not to enable wifi
[10:40:46] <somiaj> ignoring the device, vs paying attention to network status can be indepedent though
[10:40:57] <somiaj> I think it is more 'unmaged' vs 'ignore' though

[11:07:44] <grndslm> i see numerous distros discussing openrc & other alternatives, but they mostly seem like lipstick on a pig at first glance
[11:08:53] <somiaj> !why systemd
[11:08:53] <dpkg> a tired argument.  Start by reading rra's excellent analysis at https://lists.debian.org/debian-ctte/2013/12/msg00234.html  Support for other init systems (sysvinit) is still present in Debian 8-10.  systemd-shim allows userspace requiring some systemd APIs to work without it.  See <jessie sysvinit> if you have to delay or wish to avoid using it.
[11:09:11] <somiaj> grndslm: that email lists lots of pros and cons of various init systems and why debian went with systemd
[11:10:43] <somiaj> grndslm: in short systemd is the most mature and is widely supported. Debian is in the place where systemd is its main init system now, but is open if something more mature comes in the future
[11:10:57] <alkisg> It modernized the boot process, but then it went on and took over many other parts that belonged to network managers, boot loaders etc.
[11:10:57] <alkisg> Many see that as a good thing, as it makes life easier for both programmers and users, but some whine about "the unix way is to do one thing, in a manner that allows different implementations"

[11:12:31] <willow> it would be cool if someone made a documentary about how everything evolved over time.  for example what is the purpose of 'systemd-machined.service' and how was that responsibility handled before systemd?
[11:13:42] <willow> systemd seems to be like amazon or walmart.  it's basically taking over everything and seems to be a logistical improvement in numerous ways but is also scary
[11:13:51] *** Quits: p0indexter (~alpha@user/p0indexter) (Client Quit)
[11:14:24] <somiaj> although biased to many, potern's blog on systemd myths does have some good arguments.
[11:14:45] <alkisg> The C standard evolves over time. Unfortunately, the Unix/POSIX standards aren't evolving as fast. I think that aspect of systemd is positive, it modernizes things that noone dared touch in the past
[11:15:05] <grndslm> alkisg:  that is essentially the way I was introduced to Linux from a Slackware user a couple decades ago... "everything in *nix is a file"...
[11:15:18] <somiaj> though personally I found the switch to systemd painless in debian, and using systemd I find it much more useful to setup my own services and debug them once I learned the tools.
[11:15:30] <grndslm> perhaps the systemd implementation is still a group of files, but the issue is that it could be done better with one file, I believe
[11:15:43] * willow agrees with somiaj on that 
[11:16:06] <alkisg> Eh, when you have to pass IOCTLs to a device, it's no longer a simple file
[11:16:26] <somiaj> not even sysvinit was a single file, and shell scripts are so much more complicated that unit files
[11:16:56] <somiaj> but anyways, lets not discuss the merits of systemd to much (mostly off topic here), if you need help with it in debian that is a horse of a different color
[11:17:12] * willow also likes the convenience of systemd overlays
[11:17:14] <alkisg> The next step would be systemd-install-package, and it will use appstream and replace .debs and .rpms with a declarative syntax, and end the distro wars forever :P
[11:17:32] <somiaj> alkisg: you haven't noticed packaged?
[11:17:46] <grndslm> haha

[11:19:09] *** Joins: p0indexter (~alpha@user/p0indexter)
[11:19:10] <alkisg> somiaj: no I haven't, do you mean packagekit or some systemd-packaged unit?
[11:19:56] <somiaj> ahh yea, must be packagekit, for some reason I thought that was part of systemd
[11:20:11] <willow> i think packaged has yet to be invented ;-)
[11:21:20] <alkisg> I think the basic part would be "declarative syntax", to allow automatic conversion between pip, npm, rpm, deb into something homogeneous
[11:21:35] <alkisg> (FHS isn't helping on that part, changes will be needed there)
[11:21:56] <somiaj> yea that is what packagekit is meant to be, a single api that is desktop indepdnent (nice for desktop tools), which then integrates with the distro it is on and uses the actual tools
[11:22:46] <alkisg> Declarative syntax would also mean that I could install packages in an arm64 chroot from my amd64 installation without qemu
[11:22:53] <alkisg> packagekit isn't even close to that...
[11:24:08] <willow> interesting.  'pkcon search cowsay'
[11:26:56] <willow> alkisg: what do you mean by declarative syntax in terms of package management?
[11:27:55] *** Quits: p0indexter (~alpha@user/p0indexter) (Quit: parting is such sweet sorrow)
[11:28:08] <alkisg> willow: debian/rules is an executable (usually runs with `make`). While npm/package.json is a text file, that contains the information without code
[11:28:23] <alkisg> So it makes the packaging representation separated from the tools to use (make or whatever)
[11:28:51] <alkisg> So for example it would allow dpkg to install a package in a chroot, without using the chroot command, without running code inside an incompatible architecture
[11:29:04] <willow> debian/rules is non-declarative ?
[11:29:23] <alkisg> Yes, declarative means "text" while rules is code, a program
[11:29:38] <alkisg> You can't read debian/rules with a script and decide what it means
[11:29:54] <alkisg> You can't convert it to other formats, etc etc
[11:30:16] <alkisg> It's like systemd service files vs sysvinit service files
[11:30:22] <willow> right.  seems like that is an older paradigm but the modern one now is that everything is declarative
[11:30:35] <alkisg> systemd uses .ini-like files, while sysvinit uses shell code
[11:31:46] <willow> doesn't that also have to do with separation of concerns that underlies modern programming paradigms?
[11:31:57] <alkisg> While prototyping, shell code is more flexible. Now 30 years later, we already know what packaging needs, we don't need so much flexibility anymore
[11:32:20] <willow> the declarative part would be like the view or something?
[11:32:28] *** Joins: p0indexter (~alpha@user/p0indexter)
[11:32:30] <grndslm> alkisg:  .ini-like means Windows Registry-like?

[11:32:49] <alkisg> Not registry though,the older 3.11 style
[11:32:51] <alkisg> Registry is like dconf, binary
[11:33:11] <grndslm> hmm.... you must be old
[11:33:27] <alkisg> Many debian packages already have declarative syntax with debian/control and their debhelper-managed files. In that case, debian/rules is a dummy simple makefile. Those could already be automatically ported to other formats etc

[19:06:46] <Khepra> udaba: yes, but you need a filesystem capable of snapshots, like ZFS. or make full system backups some other way, rsync for example

[19:10:51] <shtrb> You will make a mistake , one day it will happen
[19:11:05] <Khepra> sid will break because you'll get a package update that came in too soon, without coordinating with upgrades in (reverse) dependencies. or it will breake because there's a bug in your use case and ithasn't been tested, retested, ironed out as it is for Stable
[19:11:06] <alkisg> udaba: parakalw! :)

[19:19:50] <shtrb> no
[19:19:58] <Khepra> the side effect of notable stability of Debian Stable is that it lags on bringing new features and new software, other than backporting security fixes. IF you want latest software, you cannot have the same promise of stability. Maybe you should consider a distro that offers what you want. Ubuntu will at least let you stay in apt/dpkg land, with 6-months bumps to software versions.

[19:20:45] <shtrb> that way you enjoy stability , but can get the most recent version of specific apps

[19:23:45] <jonathan> Ok, another question: I when I dd the boot partition and the root partition from my other computer over the boot partition and root partition of this computer - will this machine boot like my other computer then?
[19:23:46] <Khepra> speaking of, here's a bit of bad news: https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2021/09/ubuntu-makes-firefox-snap-default
[19:23:52] *** Joins: CEP (~CEP@user/cep)
[19:24:12] <Khepra> I think this is bad news because it removes a big chunk of FF maintenance in the debian/ubuntu ecosystem (with DDs shared between debian and ubuntu), so FF on debian can only suffer...
[19:24:29] <shtrb> jonathan, no , after dding a parttion you need also to update the uuid on fstab , and update the UEFI to set what to boot
[19:24:51] <Khepra> jonathan: why dd and not copy at the filesystem level?
[19:24:52] <shtrb> *You need to update in fstab if you used uuid (probably did)
[19:25:11] <shtrb> Khepra, that is an excelent question but he said it in the first place
[19:25:23] <jonathan> Khepra: Hmm.. I could also do it on the filesystem level. But I would still have to fixe the UUIDs, right?

[19:30:31] <Khepra> I just cloned a computer similarly to that. I used sgdisk to copy and recreate parition layout. I copied at filesystem level, including zfs send|receive; updated UUIDs, redone initramfs, redone and reinstalled grub-install

[21:51:19] <Urk> Khepha:  Dictionary.com defites an emulator as Computers. hardware or software designed to imitate a different piece of hardware or a different software system, in order to do the same work or run the same programs:
[21:51:20] <Urk> These JavaScript emulators allow you to run newer programs on older, incompatible operating systems.
[21:51:27] <Urk> Hope that answers your question.
[21:52:03] <Khepra> Urk: still doesn't. what does have to do with debian, 5.10 kernel, and potentially even xps 15?

[21:52:49] <Urk> Khepra:  I am running Kernel 4.19, and every attempt I have made at installing 5.10 crashed.  For that reason I am going to run it in emulation mode before bringing my system down again.
[21:53:14] <Urk> From what I hear, Kernel 5.10 works quite well on most systems, but not all.  There are still a few pieces of hardware that need work.
[21:53:27] <n4dir> installing it ended in a crash or trying to boot it made it crash?
[21:53:43] <Urk> n4dir:  Installing it caused it to crash.
[21:53:50] <n4dir> uff
[21:53:57] <Khepra> do you have any metrics of that crash? log entries? outputs?
[21:54:27] <Urk> This is why I was asking whether or not anyone had successfully got it to work on a Dell XPS 15 7590.  My hardware has both Intel and Nvidia, and I have heard reports from others that this combination was still problematic, but on systems different than mine.

[21:55:06] <n4dir> are you running debian 11 ?
[21:56:33] <Urk> Khepra:  I don't.  From what I recall on the last crash, I attempted to change the background color to get rid of the hideous dark desktop wall paper, and the system froze as soon as I selected the color option in the "desktop" settings.  I reverted to Kernel 4.19 with Timeshift/Rsync after copying my Documents, Picturs, and Desktop, but then my profile had been corrupted in the process, and ended up creating a new user profile.  I don't want to have to
[21:56:33] <Urk> waste any more time on this so installing in emulation mode is a good option.
[21:57:05] <Khepra> and what is this "emulation mode"?
[21:58:26] <n4dir> something is confusing here. First you say your system crashed when installing kernel 5.10, then you say you run it and it crashes when setting the background

[23:47:06] <tesseract> Mr_Queue: i am wondering too lol
[23:47:24] <sney> bae: a tar.gz file is an archive, like a zip file. there could be anything in there, so "install" doesn't necessarily make sense. what is your actual goal?
[23:47:42] <Mr_Queue> bae: you don't install those.
[23:48:16] <Mr_Queue> bae: It's like a suitcase.
[23:48:43] <tesseract> isn't arch using tar.gz packages?
[23:48:48] <n4dir>   assuming i understand correct: in debian and most other linux-distributions you usually don't download stuff from the web and install it, you use the package-manager of the distro.

[23:49:37] <sney> tesseract: again, it's just an archive, it could hold anything. some distros use them as packages, some upstream distributes source in tar, I have backups of photos in the same archive type

[23:56:53] <tesseract> nevermind
[23:57:01] <sney> bae: ucblogo 6.1 is in bullseye, you could backport it or update to bullseye (debian 11)
[23:57:17] <bae> tesseract yes, it's source
[23:57:29] <sney> compiling source from upstream should be a last resort. here are instructions to backport the package:
[23:57:31] <sney> dpkg: ssb
[23:57:31] <dpkg> First, check for a backport on <debian-backports>.  If unavailable: 1) Add a deb-src line for sid (not a deb line!); ask me about <deb-src sid> 2) enable debian-backports (see <bdo>) 3) apt update; apt install build-essential; apt build-dep packagename 4) apt -b source packagename 5) dpkg -i packagename-ver.deb  To change compilation options, see <package recompile>; for versions newer than sid see <uupdate>.
[23:57:47] <sney> correction, it's version 6.2 in bullseye (and up)
[23:58:26] <bae> Where is debian-backports?
[23:58:42] <alkisg> bullseye has 6.2.1, which is the latest upstream, right?
[23:58:49] <sney> this package is not in debian-backports so you can ignore that part.
[23:59:00] <bae> sney ok
[23:59:18] <bae> What is bullseye?
[23:59:36] <alkisg> The latest debian release
[23:59:37] <bae> If they have 6.2.1, that's newer than mine.
[23:59:39] <alkisg> 11. Which one are you using?
