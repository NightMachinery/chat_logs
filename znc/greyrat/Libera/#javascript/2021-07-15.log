[00:53:12] <ljharb> lol well sure but that has 24 weekly downloads, that's obviously a troll package
[00:53:16] <entuland> luckily that one only has a handful of weekly downloads and zero dependencies :P
[00:53:18] <entuland> yep
[00:53:30] <ljharb> it has 5 dependencies https://github.com/yjhuoh/is-definitely-array/blob/master/src/index.js

[10:15:00] <Muttsuri> I mean that I wanted (I think I may have found another path that doesn't require it) was to generate an array (that I know how) with it's contents initialized as object with two elements, one random and one constant and I can't use for loops, if that is possible even
[10:15:26] <ljharb> Muttsuri: of course, loops are never needed
[10:16:03] <ljharb> Muttsuri: `Array.from({ length: n }, () => ({ v: 42, k: Math.random() }))`
[10:17:14] <Muttsuri> oh, ok now I feel dumb XD, I was that close but I guess I just needed to wrap the object in () to make it work...
[10:17:24] <Muttsuri> Thank you :)

[13:03:50] <l__q> how to completly remove npm package from project? yarn remove removes only package in package.json and this package is still remaing in yarn.lock
[13:04:55] <l__q> is it a bug?
[13:07:33] <electr0n> npm uninstall should work, are you passing it globally?
[13:08:00] <l__q> why is intenret needed to remove pacakge in project?
[13:08:19] <l__q> info There appears to be trouble with your network connection. Retrying...
[13:08:28] <[R]> Running `yarn` without arguments will nuke anything not in package.json
[13:08:40] <l__q> why intenret to remove a package?

[15:33:03] <OnkelTem> Is it possible to implement file upload via a POST request ALONG WITH some other fields, except of the file itself?

[16:19:35] <enoq> hi, I was wondering how you handle env variables in tests
[16:20:30] <enoq> I am passing a couple environment variables that handle how the app connects to certain dbs
[16:21:00] <enoq> in Java + Spring you can override configuration parameters pretty simple in your test case
[16:21:30] <enoq> in the current codebase these variables seem to be buried deep in the code and you have to set them globally to do something else

[21:57:23] <entuland> Rockwood, you need to tweak the placement so that there is no gap between the element that triggers the hover and the elements it shows, otherwise the hover goes lost and you can't interact with the second level
[21:57:32] <entuland> that's a frustrating thing with menues like that

[23:33:43] <Noustropos> How else can i set paramName to variable string?

[23:33:59] <Noustropos> its functions option i guess
[23:34:37] <Noustropos> tldr; setting it to "asdf" works, but as jquery selector.val(), does not
