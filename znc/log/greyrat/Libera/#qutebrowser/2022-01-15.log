[00:48:29] <mharig> Hi folks. I started a longer download and at 98% the internet connection dropped. I have reestablished it, but qutebrowser does not continue the download. How can I solve this?
[00:50:55] <marcello42> perhaps weird question, but is it somehow possible to get the time in the status bar in the bottom? the only reason I have my bar in max mode is because of a clock.. tmux has it already ;D
[01:09:06] <mharig> Or: how do I make the download failed? Atm it is just doing nothing. Can I savely quit qutebrowser and restart it and it will remember the unfinished download?
[01:18:09] <toofar> marcello42: no clock widget currently, although there is a PR up for adding one and it came up on the text widget PR, so you are not the first to ask!
[01:19:17] <marcello42> toofar, not too bad so hopefully it gets merged
[01:19:28] <toofar> mharig: there is :download-retry but idk, I haven't had any luck with resuming downloads in qute
[01:19:50] <toofar> and :download-remove to remove one from the list
[01:19:51] <marcello42> doesn't wget resume automatically?
[01:20:23] <marcello42> if so this might be a workaround since he claims the dl was pretty big
[01:20:38] <mparillo> I always wget -c
[01:20:55] <toofar> if you pass -c to wget it'll resume based on bytes, assuming the server supports content ranges
[01:22:02] <marcello42> worth a try

[01:47:44] <marcello42> mharig: that is strange qutebrowser creates a file.. perhaps the file was removed?
[01:48:00] <marcello42> did you cancel the download by accident?
[01:54:22] <mharig> the download is ongoing, as far as qutebrowser is concerned. just with 0 B/s. I didn't remove the file, and it seems strange that qutebrowser removes the file after a while or when connection drops.
[01:58:48] <toofar> oh you said you tried re-downloading?
[02:09:03] <mharig> it has not registered the download as failed, so it will not retry
[02:12:50] <toofar> idk, I recall something about incomplete download files not being protected from being overwriten
[02:14:59] <mharig> toofar: why should qutebrowser overwrite the file of an ongoing download? and when it overwrites, what is the filename?
[02:17:55] <mharig> There are just 2 scenarios I can imagine: the filename is really obfuscated, so that I cannot find it, or it (or a spawned wget?) deletes the file after a connection drop.
[02:19:53] <toofar> "why should qutebrowser overwrite" if you tried to re-download. Although in that case I would expect a new empty incomplete one

[02:35:06] <toofar> mharig: yeah, it would be a bug
[02:35:48] <mharig> Hm. I see in the source code, that a shutdown (of browser?) does a cancel on all downloads, and that the cancel method has a parameter "remove_data", which is set to false. So quitting qutebrowser may make no harm. And if retry has deleted the file, the harm is already done. So I will quit and restart and see what happens.

[05:49:58] <leo_rockway> has anybody exported to Qutebrowser the default noscript settings? IE: the ones that block most of the stuff, but allow for common websites functionality?
[05:50:10] <leo_rockway> I think it would be a good starting point, instead of having to manually whitelist everything myself.
[05:54:14] <ectospasm> I'm not sure if this is an X11, XMonad, Alacritty, or qutebrowser problem.  IIRC, when Vivaldi was my default browser, clicking on links in Alacritty would bring Vivaldi in focus, and load the URL.  With qutebrowser, I have to manually bring qutebrowser into focus when I click on links in Alacritty.
[05:54:50] <ectospasm> qutebrowser does load the URL in a new tab, but I don't see it until I bring qutebrowser into focus.
[05:55:21] <ectospasm> qutebrowser is usually on a different XMonad workspace, and I have a hotkey that brings qutebrowser into focus.

[23:44:09] <leo_rockway> The-Compiler: I set my weechat up probably in 2007 and it works exactly how I want it to work, so I haven't checked for any new interesting scripts in a while. An extension API for Qutebrowser would be neat, but the userscripts we have now are really nice too!
