[01:45:11] <KevinCarbonara> So backblaze is unlimited backup for 70$ a year for mac/pc
[01:45:26] <KevinCarbonara> but backing up from a nas or other sort of server is more expensive
[01:46:10] <KevinCarbonara> then they have 5$/tb storage for non-personal devices like a nas
[01:47:27] <KevinCarbonara> I don't guess they have anything in between? I have about 15TB I'd like to back up and 75$ a month is just a bit too much for me. I could use their 70$ a year, but I still plan on building a NAS soon

[05:37:58] <Snuupy> ah yes
[05:38:11] <Snuupy> session support is like, each browsing session - can I save a snapshot of all my browser windows and tabs
[05:39:20] <Snuupy> bookmarks don't do that well because if you ctrl-shift-d you have to manually type in the date etc
[05:39:24] <Snuupy> it's not very...usable
[05:39:32] <Snuupy> and then position the location of the save
[05:39:36] <Snuupy> it just doesn't really make sense
[05:39:39] <Snuupy> you can't really browse it well either
[05:39:57] <Snuupy> let me see if I can come up with a 1 liner to make sense of it
[05:40:01] <joepie91> oh, so 'session support' would only be false for bookmark managers, not for tab managers, then?
[05:40:12] <Snuupy> https://sessionbuddy.com/
[05:40:17] <joepie91> since for tabs it's presumably handled by the browser

[05:40:31] <Snuupy> let me double check
[05:40:39] <Snuupy> yes that is correct
[05:40:47] <Snuupy> session support means the row is a bookmark MANAGER, but not a tab manager
[05:40:58] <joepie91> right

[18:57:35] <skye0> ThePendulum: Futa? Just ladies with dicks
[18:59:02] <ThePendulum> oh for fuck sake now Germany is doing the porn identification thing too
[19:00:23] <ThePendulum> ah, I guess HS2 doesn't really allow for that, not sure if it's stigmatized in japan. I would be surprised if you can't stick a dick on a female Sim with a mod
[19:01:07] <labrador> ThePendulum, whats the porn identification thing?
[19:01:33] <ThePendulum> Germany just banned xHamster because they didn't ask for ID to verify your age
[19:01:44] <labrador> Sometimes I think countries try too hard to protect the "purity" and "innocence" of children. I started watching porn at 11 and I turned out fine.
[19:01:55] <labrador> Its too dystopian for something that gives no inherent advantage
[19:03:11] <ThePendulum> I do think porn comes with risks, but I agree this is not the solution, it should be part of sex ed imo
[19:03:51] <labrador> Like we don't even have proof porn watching is bad for adults let alone children...Its just plain moral superiority stuff at this point
[19:04:42] <ThePendulum> I get a bit skeptical when "think of the children" is used. on one hand I do think there are definitely people out there who are this painfully conservative, on the other hand, is this just a way to track people even more?
[19:05:42] <labrador> ThePendulum, yeah it is a way to track people more for the government. But there are some people who believe it actually helps children. Which it doesn't...
[19:05:54] <ThePendulum> I do think young teens should be educated about the contrast between porn and a healthy sex life
[19:06:58] <ThePendulum> there is an endless supply of horror stories from women getting with guys that couldn't figure that out on their own
[19:07:40] <labrador> ThePendulum, yeah well thats a good idea. But the point is keeping them safe doesn't really work out in the long term. It just makes them ignorant on all sexual topics
[19:11:22] <ThePendulum> I don't know how I'm not an incel yet (I think, anyway...). I had one girlfriend in my early teens and since that I've only really watched an unreasonable amount of porn over the past decade
[19:12:20] <ThePendulum> and time and time again I am staggered what the folks in the comment think what "all women want", like what the fuck did you do to get to that point
[19:12:26] <NeoThermic> <labrador> Like we don't even have proof porn watching is bad for adults | "University of Montreal researchers wanted to compare the attitudes of non-porn watchers to regular viewers." "We started our research seeking men in their twenties who had never consumed pornography. We couldn’t find any"
[19:12:40] <labrador> lmaooo
[19:12:54] <ThePendulum> haha
[19:13:22] <NeoThermic> the rest of their research is interesting though because they pivoted into looking at the viewing habits
[19:13:23] <unfinity> ・゜゜・。。 ​ ・゜゜\_​O< qu​ack!
[19:13:26] <NeoThermic> ,bang
[19:13:26] <unfinity> NeoThermic you shot a duck in 3.787 seconds! You have killed 374 ducks in #datahoarder.
[19:13:28] <labrador> !bang
[19:13:32] <labrador> oh ,
[19:14:10] <labrador> ThePendulum, I've had no girlfriends ever...but thats not cuz i started to watch porn. Thats cuz I don't try to. Also because I studied in a boys school so I've never had any interaction with girls in my teens.
[19:14:13] <ThePendulum> it's interesting that both men /and/ women are turned on by facials more if they watch porn regularly

[22:18:12] <skye0> I'd like to play a 3D sex game where I could create my own avatar I think, but I would prefer ones where I can add dicks to the women

[22:18:33] <skye0> First attempt with `dd` and `pigz`

[22:20:51] <skye0> Actually a bit faster because it's less than an hour and I got 100 GB transferred - at this rate I anticipate just 1 TB in 10 hours - bear in mind the only bottleneck is the external HDD, no longer doing this from the live USB.
