[04:32:53] <squirrel> hi. i want to match uris, both http and non-http, treating http differently. something like `(http://foo|[a-z]+://[a-z]+)`. but this also matches `http://bar`. what's a nice way to make it match `http://foo`, `bar://bar` but not `http://bar`?
[04:33:52] <squirrel> i imagine using lookahead
[05:00:59] <digitok> \b(?!http://bar\b)[a-z]+://[a-z]+
[05:05:34] <squirrel> (foo is not a real expression, just a placeholder)
[05:07:37] <squirrel> i was thinking of `(http://foo|(?!http:)[a-z]+://[a-z]+)` or `(http://foo|(?!http:)[a-z]+://(?<!http://)[a-z]+)`

[11:19:33] <varun37> now its saved
[11:20:14] <varun37> so my issue is I have regex and it finds all parameters from request BUT i need to fetch parameters based on request 
[11:20:17] <varun37> like 
[11:20:44] <varun37> if I give {1} it sjould give me total_impacted_count
[11:21:10] <varun37> if I give {2} then it should give me : services.highest_impacting_priority
[11:21:18] <varun37> if {3} then 26
[11:21:21] <varun37> like wise
[11:21:38] <Me-me> That's something your implementation should be able to handle.
[11:22:14] <Me-me> There are ways to do it in the pattern, but it might be easier to do it with your code.
[11:22:19] <Me-me> Or your tool.
[11:23:00] <varun37> yes ... but i want regex to give me that with my current situation I cant use any code
[11:23:10] <varun37> it would have been easier with code

[11:35:25] <army> i need litlle help here https://regex101.com/r/93PiyL/1
[11:38:56] <varun37> Hi Me-me , I am using notepad++ for testing purpose only , but the tool where I am putting regex accepts only Java flavour of regex
[11:39:12] <varun37> so \K doesot work there
[11:39:39] <varun37> for PCRE your regex works perfectly fine 
[11:39:44] <Me-me> Okay well that's a different story.
[11:39:51] <varun37> and I want this output only
[11:40:04] <varun37> but in regex floavour java
[11:40:20] <digitok> https://regex101.com/r/93PiyL/2
[11:40:29] <Me-me> If it's being implemented in another flavour of regex then you're stuck with the version that highlights a lot.
[11:40:38] <Me-me> Which could be /2 or /3
[11:40:44] <digitok> 07varun37, which version of java
[11:40:53] <Me-me> But please note
[11:40:54] <varun37> java8
[11:41:11] <Me-me> That just because it highlights doesn't mean that it won't work - you just use the capture group 1 instead of the whole match text.
[11:41:15] <army> digitok: thx bro
[11:42:12] <varun37> Me-me ok tx .. let me try and get back

[11:54:33] <varun37> Hi Me-me please see this screenshot shows my tool in which I put your regex : https://ibb.co/hRXbGP4
[11:55:13] <varun37> now it replaces GET part , but i wanted to remove first param value
[11:55:23] <Me-me> Why are both your screenshots such low resolution o_o
[11:56:27] <varun37> Me-me let me send u from another site , but its fine at my end
[11:57:24] <varun37> Me-me check here plz
[11:57:26] <varun37> https://pasteboard.co/KcCw4AE.jpg
[11:58:55] <Me-me> Here, try this https://regex101.com/r/LQ4MRY/6
[11:59:10] <Me-me> By putting a capture group around the text we want to be kept, we can put it back in in the substitution.
[12:03:00] <varun37> Me-me , ecact same behaviour as I shown in screenshot
[12:03:05] <varun37> exact
[12:03:16] <Me-me> Did you change the replacement text?
[12:03:54] <varun37> yes in replacement text i put string as - "superman"
[12:04:08] <Me-me> Use $1superman instead
[12:04:09] <varun37> shall i share screenshot again
[12:04:11] <varun37> ok
[12:04:15] <varun37> let me try
[12:06:09] <varun37> same behaviour 
[12:06:10] <varun37> https://pasteboard.co/KcCzECj.jpg
[12:06:17] <varun37> Me-me
[12:06:42] <Me-me> I see, so it doesn't use regex substitution.
[12:07:19] <Me-me> Can you tell me the tool?
[12:08:17] <digitok> you can see if \1 works
[12:08:51] <varun37> Me-me https://github.com/nccgroup/AutoRepeater
[12:08:56] <varun37> this is the tool
[12:09:02] <varun37> ok checking
[12:10:34] <varun37> in replacement text i put \1superman
[12:10:38] <varun37> same behavour
[12:10:46] <Me-me> My unprofessional recommendation is to submit a request on github that they implement proper regex substitution so you can use all the tools of regex. As it stands I don't see a way to do it.
