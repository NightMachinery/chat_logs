[02:04:36] <mefistofeles> AnnoyedFirefoxia: hmm they work fine around here, but I guess it does depend a lot on your setup...
[02:04:46] <mefistofeles> I use intel
[02:05:29] <AnnoyedFirefoxia> mefistofeles the setup is more than enough to handle 2k and 4k, other browsers don't have this problem, only firefox.
[02:07:28] <mefistofeles> AnnoyedFirefoxia: yeah, this is not uncommon, what firefox version are you using?
[02:08:19] <AnnoyedFirefoxia> mefistofeles 94, this has been happening for years, it's just that i didn't bother much with resolutions higher than 1080 until now
[02:12:00] <mefistofeles> I see, AnnoyedFirefoxia can you check if you have gpu acceleration?
