[09:55:14] <sd> 15<b​brendon> got an air sensor

[09:59:29] <Cl0udNinja> have you checked whether its actually UV or not?

[09:59:55] <Cl0udNinja> well yeah
[10:00:00] <Cl0udNinja> thats why you dont look directly at it lol

[10:00:17] <Cl0udNinja> that doesnt mean anything imo lol

[10:01:01] <sd> 02<M​itchy93> i have a dust mite allergy and i get a blocked nose in my sleep, no matter how much i vacuum or change the sheets
[10:01:19] <sd> 02<M​itchy93> i also live close to a main road
[10:01:32] <Cl0udNinja> you can do that with a $10 fan and $2 worth of a filter every 3-6 months

[10:03:09] <Cl0udNinja> my AC unit is the dumbest shit ever
[10:03:21] <Cl0udNinja> to turn it on or control it, you have to have the remote control
[10:03:45] <sd> 02<M​itchy93> get a broadlink RM3
[10:03:52] <Cl0udNinja> and the IR reciever is in a tiny little hole on the top of the unit where the controller is supposed to sit normally
[10:03:56] <sd> 02<M​itchy93> or if its RF, an RM pro
[10:04:36] <Cl0udNinja> I dont care that much, if I have to turn it on, I just get up and adjust it, its just stupid that the remote is mostly useless without close line of sight
[10:04:58] <sd> 02<M​itchy93> when i lived at the parents, i used to mess with them with the RF transmit function and start playing with the electric fireplace
[10:05:03] <Cl0udNinja> also the remote is janky af and if you look at it wrong it gets fucky
[10:05:30] <sd> 02<M​itchy93> the fan light was also IR and id also use that
[10:06:16] <Cl0udNinja> I have some of those shitty arduino modules, I could probably rig up a stupid simple repeater without any microcontroller if I was really motivated
[10:07:04] <Cl0udNinja> 433mhz radio transmitter hooked to an ir reciever taped to the remote, and an ir transmitter connected to a radio receiver
[10:12:36] <sd> 02<M​itchy93> or just use home assistant
[10:12:54] <sd> 02<M​itchy93> and their cloud stuff to hook it into google assistant or alexa
[10:13:19] <sd> 02<M​itchy93> i use ESPhome to read my sensors and control stuff

[18:52:19] <koollman> I prefer some different keystone, like digitus DN-93617. Easy enough for home

[18:55:55] <koollman> and the setup is really easy. put each wire in the corresponding color coded slot. 4 on each side so I can do it with my not-nimble fingers :)

[19:40:49] <Gaboradon> Hello
[19:42:38] <Gaboradon> I have a corrupt XFS 1TB drive, just 1 data partiton (or it may be bootable), so far I've successfully ddrescued onto an image, ran TestDisk and at first it thought it's a FAT32 partition, other software too, then it reported XFS 6.2+
[19:43:19] <Gaboradon> I've installed XFS utilities and I'm currently on OpenSUSE, any more suggestions or warnings before I try xfs_check ... and repair ?
[19:48:34] <Gaboradon> Maybe people in #hardware might be more suited for this, ah otherwise I'd need to go to OFTC for #xfs

[22:09:28] <ccp> Is there any convention for how to indicate optional arguments in bash documentation? I'm editing something that's using ".." to indicate that additional arguments can be appended; e.g., `mkdir newdir1 newdir2 ..`, which seems like not exactly the best option. But I can't seem to find something that's tastefully unambiguous
[22:11:12] <koollman> ccp: command arg [optionalarg...]
[22:12:14] <ccp> Also interested in opinions on keyboard shortcut notation. At the moment I'm thinking I'll use emacs notation for the emacs mode stuff and the slightly different vi notation (maybe) for the vi-mode section, just in the interest of not having people taken by surprise some time later when other documentation doesn't say "ctrl-shift-X" etc.
