[02:25:10] <e1> Oh, yeah that makes sense
[02:25:19] <e1> I always have dual ssid for 2.4GHz and 5Ghz
[02:25:40] <e1> I want to run an ssid specifically for IOT devices tho, treat that traffic different.
[02:25:45] <JollyRgrs> i once thought that
[02:25:59] <JollyRgrs> but oyu might traverse from 5ghz to 2.4ghz if the range isn't so great on 5
[02:26:07] <JollyRgrs> can't do that as easily if you have different SSIDs
[02:26:26] <JollyRgrs> and yeah, as you said besides the 2.4ghz, i have it on a diff vlan, too
[02:26:48] <e1> Wait waht do you mean I might traverse from 5Ghz to 2.4?
[02:27:06] <e1> For IoT?
[02:27:15] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> no like
[02:27:17] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> your laptop
[02:27:24] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> might shift to the 2.4 if it things it's more reliable/stronger signal
[02:27:30] <e1> ahh
[02:27:37] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> if you have your shit named "SSID 5GHz" and "SSID 2.4GHz" it cant do that
[02:27:45] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> it can only do that kind of shifting if the SSID/password is the same
[02:27:50] <e1> Yeah that' sokay, I dont really want it to anyway
[02:28:05] <sd> 07<Q​uantumFoam> pffffft I don't advertise

[02:29:02] <sd> 07<Q​uantumFoam> this reminds me I have a backlog of shit for my home network
[02:29:04] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> so you could get in and poke around
[02:29:04] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> lol
[02:29:05] <sd> 07<Q​uantumFoam> like a Pihole

[02:29:37] <sd> 07<Q​uantumFoam> the new hotness
[02:29:38] <e1> idk i'm not that autistic
[02:29:53] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> its the one with more gbs
[02:29:59] <e1> to contradict that tho, I am looking at doing a pihole
[02:30:13] <e1> But I'd really like to get a hat with multiple ports on it 
[02:30:17] <sd> 07<Q​uantumFoam> as long as you have a good powerful AP yeah you can get over a gigabit on AX
[02:30:56] <sd> 07<Q​uantumFoam> I think you can just run Pihole as a VM/container now?
[02:31:06] <sd> 07<Q​uantumFoam> I might just put it on my Proxmox machine if that's the case
[02:31:16] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> pihole's always been runnable that way
[02:31:26] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> its always just been something you install on a debian based distro
[02:31:34] <sd> 07<Q​uantumFoam> yeah, thought so
[02:31:35] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> the idea was just to use a low power device to run it 24/7
[02:31:40] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> and pis were the hotness
[02:31:42] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> so that's the whole point
[02:32:04] <e1> ooo you use proxmox
[02:32:06] <e1> nice :D
[02:32:10] <e1> love me some proxmox
[02:32:15] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> not everyone who wants to use pihole wants to run 24/7 vm hosts
[02:32:18] <sd> 07<Q​uantumFoam> another backlog item: UPS for all of my internet-related devices, because I have fiber
[02:32:23] <sd> 07<Q​uantumFoam> meaning that if the power goes out
[02:32:29] <sd> 07<Q​uantumFoam> technically I still have internet
[02:32:43] <sd> 07<Q​uantumFoam> so I want battery backup for the ONT, router, etc
[02:32:43] <JollyRgrs> pihole is just DNS with a web GUI
[02:32:59] <e1> I thought pihole had some firewally thing to it
[02:33:02] <sd> 08<a​bakedapplepie> Found this old bastard today, no power adapter tho 😦

[02:33:11] <sd> 07<Q​uantumFoam> it's not a firewall
[02:33:15] <sd> 08<a​bakedapplepie> I missed this thing
[02:33:19] <sd> 07<Q​uantumFoam> it's exactly what it sounds like, a hole
[02:33:26] <e1> oh fuck that then
[02:33:28] <sd> 07<Q​uantumFoam> there's a list of stuff that goes in the hole
[02:33:35] <sd> 07<Q​uantumFoam> advertisements, etc
[02:33:42] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> e1: it's just dns filtering
[02:33:43] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> that's all
[02:33:45] <sd> 07<Q​uantumFoam> it's really damn effective at blocking ALL ads
[02:33:55] <e1> I'm good then
[02:34:01] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> it's just DNS blacklisting
[02:34:04] <sd> 07<Q​uantumFoam> you no longer need a blocker in your browser and it can even block ads on streaming devices
[02:34:10] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> and it fucking blows too if you want to do shit like DNS forwarders, etc
[02:34:20] <JollyRgrs> i just use opnsense for my routing and unbind has an option to add blacklists... add steve's blacklist and it's basically a default pihole setup
[02:34:22] <e1> Oh what
[02:34:30] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> I have to use my router anyway to do DNS forwarding, then forward upstream DNS to the pihole, then let the pihole go up to the internet
[02:34:33] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> it's stupid
[02:34:48] <e1> @Hunterkll that sounds about right tho?
[02:34:51] <sd> 08<a​bakedapplepie> I wonder if I can do blacklisting on the udmp
[02:35:05] <e1> JollyRgrs: opnsense is <3 
[02:35:06] <sd> 07<Q​uantumFoam> Yeah, it would be nice if you could just do this in the router
[02:35:07] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> e1: Ideally, you want all DNS to be set to the pihole itself, so it's client -> pihole -> internet
[02:35:11] <sd> 08<a​bakedapplepie> Always wanted to look into it but never bothered
[02:35:15] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> no no
[02:35:17] <JollyRgrs> i tried a pihole for abrief moment, was a PITA and I just decided to do it all on the same place
[02:35:19] <sd> 07<Q​uantumFoam> Not sure why no one has come out with a consumer router that can do it yet
[02:35:19] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> i have no issue setting client DNS to the pihole
[02:35:29] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> if the pihole could *fucking do DNS forwarders properly*
[02:35:33] <e1> JollyRgrs: I was under the impression that pihole was opsense for noobs but glad I got that cleared up before I went investigating :\
[02:35:35] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> so I have to use my router as a crutch
[02:35:38] <JollyRgrs> there's... backlash for openly blocking all the ads
[02:35:41] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> and I do n't have per-client statistics and data
[02:35:47] <JollyRgrs> do you think netgear wants to block netgear ads getting to your PC?
[02:35:52] <sd> 08<a​bakedapplepie> ^
[02:35:56] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> because to the pihole, it's only my router making all DNS queries
[02:36:05] <sd> 07<Q​uantumFoam> I think netgear should shut the fuck up and be grateful to get my money
[02:36:14] <e1> ohhhhhhhh i see
[02:36:55] <e1> @Hunterkll I would have thought you have it as an edge device, handle all your internal zones with your internal DNS/DC then forward from DNS/DC to pihole
[02:37:02] <sd> 07<Q​uantumFoam> honestly I don't see how anyone makes any money off web advertising any more considering how widespread blockers are
[02:37:15] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> no
[02:37:21] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> half the features of pihole are all the per-client stats and shit
[02:37:28] <sd> 07<Q​uantumFoam> except on phones, I guess
[02:37:31] <e1> lol eh
[02:37:32] <sd> 07<Q​uantumFoam> that's probably a big chunk of it
[02:37:41] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> blockers are not as widespread as you seem to think they are
[02:37:42] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> lol
[02:37:51] <JollyRgrs> lol, how widespread blockers are?
[02:37:54] <e1> @QuantumFoam it's not about 'making money' in some cases. Some of it's about brand recognition, some of it's about pulling traffic back
[02:37:57] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> a very small segment of the internet uses them
[02:37:57] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> lol
[02:37:59] <JollyRgrs> outside of IT people, what % do you think have blockers?
[02:38:01] <e1> Mostly it still comes up
[02:38:03] <sd> 07<Q​uantumFoam> really?
[02:38:07] <e1> urgh brb
[02:38:09] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> hell, i don't even use any adblockers
[02:38:17] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> then again i just don't in general use browser extensions at all, but that's a different point

[02:38:52] <e1> TOOOLBAR
[02:38:58] <JollyRgrs> i like ad blocking for playing phone games
[02:39:02] <e1> It has GOOGLE and a nifty little quick link to our homepage!
[02:39:06] <sd> 07<Q​uantumFoam> I mean in many cases the advertisement payload is larger than the website itself, which slows it down
[02:39:17] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> but anyway
[02:39:33] <e1> I thought I would get ot have a coffee this morning in peace :(
[02:39:35] <e1> bbl
[02:39:36] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> e1: way it's set up right now, router handles all DNS and forwards upstream, except for the AD domain, which it forwards to the DCs

[02:40:12] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> since pihole can't do forwarding like that, to use pihole i had to (when i tried it) have the router point tot he pihole as its upstream dns

[02:40:24] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> so it added yet another dns hop and caching layer

[03:06:52] <JollyRgrs> not the ones i made for my wife recently
[03:06:58] <e1> oo orly
[03:07:02] <e1> what were they
[03:07:03] <JollyRgrs> i mean, you gotta do them in the pan on the stove, can't microwave them
[03:07:05] <JollyRgrs> no clue
[03:07:11] <JollyRgrs> didn't pay attn. black bean somethings

[03:07:42] <e1> Hmm... I wonder if you could put some wheat gluten into the pattie to make it less mushy, more chewy
[03:08:10] <JollyRgrs> i bet if you spell it patty, it'll be less mushy, too
[03:08:21] <JollyRgrs> you want the outside to get slightly crisp/crunch
[03:08:23] <e1> heh
[03:08:25] <JollyRgrs> not much, but a little
[03:08:32] <JollyRgrs> and prob the thinner the better
[03:08:41] <JollyRgrs> caramelize the outside
