[06:09:56] <bindi> wash it with hot water, dry with a heatgun
[06:10:30] <bindi> if there are tricky spots where water can get trapped, try to displace it with alcohol and then give it some more heatgun

[16:58:33] <savolla> I think the vnc solution can be applied but I block the internet connection of my host machine. while vm uses a wi-fi dongle to connect
[16:58:33] <lopid> maybe via some network route
[16:59:27] <savolla> is that possible? wi-fi of the host (windows10) is not connected to the net
[16:59:58] <lopid> your vm tech likely can provide its own private lan, at least

[23:26:44] <jethro3> Hi. It turns out that running "flatpak install <package" as installs packages in the /var directory - without asking for password - even if it's ran as a non-root user, as long as the user running the command is a member of sudo. How can this happen, and how can I make sure that other binaries that I'm running as a local user (belonging to sudo)
[23:26:44] <jethro3> don't have root privileges
[23:27:39] <lopid> a polkit policy, maybe? or maybe you've no timeout in sudoers
