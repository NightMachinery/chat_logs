[00:27:04] <Guest77> Hey :)  
[00:27:59] <Guest77> I want to traverse over a binary tree, so I need to run two recurs at the end of the loop. how can I do this?

[00:34:00] <hiredman> you can't, just like at the end of a while loop in C or Java, you can only loop one way

[00:39:11] <manicennui> I think the problem is that you need 15 additional things to make SMTP truly usable and secure.
[00:40:06] <manicennui> Postfix and Qmail don't do all of those things.
[00:40:25] <Guest77> Thanks! In Java you can do something like: Int f(i:Int) { if(i==0) { return 1} return f(--i) + f(--i) } 
[00:40:45] <Guest77> So your point is that we can't do this with TCO?
[00:41:14] <technomancy> you can't return from a function twice
[00:41:42] <technomancy> you can have two tail positions in a function tho
[00:42:12] <sobel> manicennui: so i found, after i started outfitting my postfix setup with greylisting and mail list managers, etc
[00:44:18] <Guest77> With if or something like that? but I need to traverse in both left and right nodes of the tree
[00:44:30] <raek> Guest77: you can use "ordinary" recursion instead of "recur" (use the function name instead of "recur"). but that doesn't give you tail call optimizaition (because it requires the call to be in tail position, i.e. the last thing a function does)
[00:45:45] <Guest77> I understand, their is a way to solve this? I don't want to reinvent the wheel, because this is a "simple" tree traversal problem, each iteration needs to invoke the function for both left and right nodes
[00:49:10] <raek> what kind of data structure do you use for the tree?
[00:49:28] <sobel> Guest77: are you implementing this because you want to or because you have to? there may be something for this already; trees are really popular. https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/tree-seq
[00:50:29] <sobel> generally, https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.walk
[00:51:00] <hiredman> your java example of `return f(--i) + f(--i)` in clojure would be `(+ (f (dec i)) (f (dec i)))`
[00:51:29] <hiredman> in both cases you will consume extra stackspace with the recursive calls
[00:51:55] <hiredman> and the same would be true in a language with tco, because those function calls are not in tail position
[00:51:58] <sobel> isn't --i going to mutate i before the 2nd time?
[00:52:02] <jeaye> Also, that's not Java. Maybe it's TypeScript.
[00:52:08] <sobel> oic
[00:53:03] <jeaye> Yeah, careful of that -- to dec mapping. -- is mutating.
[00:53:23] <Guest77> Yeah, Java isn't my day-to-day lang :)

[00:53:33] <hiredman> in any language
[00:53:40] <Guest77> I think you gave me here some directions, thanks a lot!
[00:54:07] <hiredman> like, it doesn't matter, you can't do that sort of thing that way in constant stack space
[00:54:48] <hiredman> you can turn it into something that uses constant stack space if you are willing to use heap space
[00:54:54] <Guest77> Yeah, I understand now. thanks!
[00:55:02] <jeaye> Also, aside from tree-seq and clojure.walk, we also have specter.
[00:55:21] <jeaye> i.e. manually implementing this yourself doesn't sound like normal Clojure.
[00:55:40] <jeaye> Sounds like normal Java though. ;)
