[00:01:08] <Bunny351> yes, it's kind of strangely designed. I use it mostly for rebuilding when files change, but then I can run it in a separate terminal
[00:01:43] <Bunny351> also, why does it have to mess with the terminal at all? just reading files from another file would be fine

[04:18:35] <Zipheir> klovett: Do you have any plan to port srfi-101 to CHICKEN 5?  I'd like to use it and would be happy to help with porting efforts if there's a public repo somewhere I can make a PR to.
[04:35:48] <wasamasa> it all lives on svn, no
[04:36:55] <Zipheir> Well, I have an svn account...  I volunteer to do the porting.
[05:00:41] <elflng> i have the whole svn archive...
[05:00:57] <elflng> which is srfi-101?
[05:01:29] <elflng> ooh, nifty.
[05:01:52] <elflng> that reminds me, i need to finish porting the cheap true randomness source to chicken.
[05:03:49] <Zipheir> "flexvectors" came up on #scheme and I was thinking, "I know there's a 'pure' datastructure for that".
[05:03:58] <elflng> there was a paper a few years back about the molecular differences in the silicon leading to a high quality randomness source by timing repeated blocks of simple overflow additions
[05:04:41] <elflng> which i implemented in c in a few diff ways and found that it made a perfectly normalised distribution and was true-random by all available tests
[05:04:58] <elflng> (tried it on several machines, OSes, OS vers, etc)
[05:05:45] <elflng> its quite cute. the one issue is that to do it really efficiently, you need to generate large amounts of randomness at a time and cache it, which is problematic for memory safety.
[05:06:12] <elflng> whats a flexvector? i thought that was just a resizable vector?
[05:06:16] <Zipheir> Yes.
[05:06:28] <Zipheir> (SRFI 214, not yet ported to CHICKEN.)
[05:07:18] <elflng> doesnt that roughly correspond to a dynamic alloced c array?
[05:07:26] <elflng> (flexvector under that definition)
[05:07:38] <Zipheir> Usually.
[05:07:50] <elflng> ... so it should be trivial to do in chicken, yes?
[05:08:32] <elflng> its still only O(log(n)) according to the srfi doc, which is much worse than O(1) 
[05:08:33] <Zipheir> Maybe not *trivial*, but you could probably make a very fast implementation for CHICKEN, yes.
[05:08:46] <Zipheir> O(1) is usually a myth :)
[05:08:49] <elflng> so its just replacing a list with a balanced bintree
[05:08:57] <elflng> C array ref is O(1), yes?
[05:09:09] <elflng> (its not 1 but it is constant, or should be.)
[05:09:28] <Zipheir> Only allegedly.  IIUC it's going to be more like O(log n) with large arrays.
[05:09:37] <Zipheir> What with paging, etc.
[05:09:46] *** Quits: skapata (~Skapata@user/skapata) (Remote host closed the connection)
[05:10:13] <elflng> paging isnt calculable in the general case, i thought?
[05:10:43] <Zipheir> "It is not much of an exaggeration to say that the difference between a functional and an imperative programmer is that the functional programmer doesn't assume an O(1) array access." --Richard Bird
[05:10:52] <elflng> heh
[05:10:59] <Zipheir> Though he goes on to say the same thing about "O(1) array access".
[05:11:36] <elflng> i assume that if im dealing with enough memory per single structure where paging becomes an issue, that ive already optimised the structure to where it will be O(1) :)
[05:11:42] <Zipheir> I don't think flexvectors are an abomination, but I like rlists more.
[05:12:29] <Zipheir> Hah.
[05:12:31] <elflng> from the srfi-101 doc, it looks like its just redefining the extant primitives to handle the new structure but doesnt actually define the implementation for the new structure
[05:12:57] <Zipheir> Implementation detail :)
[05:13:00] <elflng> which would really kill the efficiency of anything that uses both rlists and regular lists.
[05:13:20] <elflng> not really, i really dont like overloading things that are used everywhere
[05:13:29] <elflng> its a fast way to make things way way less efficient. :)
[05:13:41] <Zipheir> It's described by Okasaki in _Pure Functional Data Structures_.
[05:13:49] <Zipheir> Oh, does it overload cons, et al?
[05:13:54] <elflng> yes.
[05:14:48] <elflng> cons, car, cdr, pair?, list, quote, equal?, eq? ca*d*r, null? list?, make-list, length, append, reverse, list-tail, etc etc etc
[05:14:48] <Zipheir> That's weird design, indeed.
[05:15:02] <elflng> list-ref, map, for-each
[05:15:02] <Zipheir> I think this came up when it was being considered for r7rs...
[05:15:02] <elflng> etc
[05:15:12] <elflng> this is what i would consider Bad Design inherently.
[05:15:58] <elflng> from the srfi doc, it looks like its basically what plt wanted to do with lists as a whole, which is why it doesnt matter to r6. 
[05:16:08] <elflng> which is probably why its not supported at all in chicken :)
[05:17:06] <elflng> why do we have flexvectors when theres already an array (or more than one array) srfi with mutable size?
[05:20:31] <Zipheir> I guess the idea with reusing all of those identifiers was to make rlists drop-in replacements for lists.  Still, that makes it hard to use without renaming...
[05:20:53] <Zipheir> No idea.  If you're talking about Lucier's array SRFI(s), probably people didn't fully understand them.
[05:21:48] <Zipheir> OK, all the stuff from SRFI 101 was prefaced with rlist- for R7RS.
[05:21:54] <Zipheir> More verbose, but less of a mess.
[05:22:51] <elflng> i was thinking of the slib array stuff, not lucier's//
[05:27:10] <elflng> fwiw, doing a vector-resize without a copy shouldnt be that difficult in scheme.
[05:27:36] <elflng> still in O(1) (theoretically) though slightly slower O(1)
[05:28:21] <elflng> would either require overloading the basic vector ops or a new set of funcs...
[05:29:02] <Zipheir> Side effects!
[05:29:12] <elflng> not from side effects
[05:29:26] <Zipheir> I think if srfi-101 is ported to CHICKEN 5, it should definitely rename everything: rlist-cons, rlist?, etc.
[05:34:39] <elflng> rs-vector? make-rs-vector, rs-vector, rs-vector-ref,set!,length,resize! rs-vector->vector,list and vice versa... anything im missing for the basics?
[05:35:25] <elflng> (fwiw, chicken already has vector-resize built in)
[05:35:49] <elflng> (so this is kinda a waste of time for me to show how it can be done in a general case without increasing time complexity)
[05:36:04] <elflng> im happy to finish writing the code if youre interested, though i do have a few things i need to do first.
[05:36:07] <Zipheir> Why rs-?
[05:36:13] <elflng> resizable
[05:36:18] <Zipheir> SRFI 214 settled on flexvector- .
[05:37:59] <elflng> im not doing srfi-214, im just trying to show a trivial way to do resizable vectors without increasing time complexity :)
[05:38:05] <elflng> and without doing copies.
[05:38:38] <Zipheir> OK.
[05:39:05] <Zipheir> Well, if it *does* happen as an egg, I think following the names from SRFI 214 would be less confusing.
[05:39:45] <elflng> im not trying to do an egg, or an SRFI, just a trivial thought on how to go about doing such things whilst requiring neither copies nor worse time than O(1) (assuming vector-ref is O(1))
[05:39:57] <elflng> meaning no hidden cost
[05:40:53] <elflng> every certain number of grows, there will be a slight bump, but without copying :)

[05:46:46] <elflng> that might actually push it up slighly for complexity, so probably not. hm. just trying to handle the extreme cases, very large numbers of grows)
[05:46:54] <elflng> mismatched ) argh
[05:49:41] <elflng> ah, i could probably accept an option for what to do in these cases, that would be best - whether to copy after certain points or to build recursively. i dont want there to be cases where large numbers of grows followed by shrink grow shrink grow etc cause issues for known boundaries

[19:09:40] <Bunny351> jcowan: what does it mean when r7rs says for case conversion "note that language-sensitive mappings and foldings are not used"?

[19:15:04] <florz> Bunny351: I'd think that probably refers to the fact that case mapping can be locale dependent?
[19:15:51] <Bunny351> so special cases for TR/AZ or German ß would not apply?
[19:16:05] <Bunny351> hm, the latter would, I guess
[19:17:41] <Bunny351> the utf8 egg does locale-specific special casing on dotted-small-i for turkish and azeri and lithuanian
[19:17:59] <Bunny351> I thought unicode would make such things unecessary...
[19:18:26] <florz> no idea re the specific details, but something like that would be my guess, yeah
[19:22:02] <wasamasa> I think it's about high time that people rebrand themselves from "solution engineer" to "problem creator"
[19:23:20] <fantazo> wasamasa: that would be honest. honesty is not reflected in a paycheck.
[19:23:35] <wasamasa> if it were, I'd be stupidly rich
