[14:19:54] <m1dnight> Hi all. I'm writing my resume for my university. I copied the structure from somebody else's. I'm confused about the capitalization of the words. 
[14:20:10] <m1dnight> https://call-cc.be/~christophe/tmp/Screenshot%202022-01-04%20at%2011.46.03.png
[14:20:33] <m1dnight> I would assume that you start each line with a capital, and the labs/universitites with capitals.
[14:20:37] <m1dnight> But I'm unsure.
[14:20:58] <m1dnight> So "Doctoral researcher at Software Languages Lab (SOFT)" instead of "Doctoral Researcher at Software Languages Lab (SOFT)"

[21:17:45] <acdw> 7
[21:17:52] <huf> yeah but we're counting leave
[21:17:55] <huf> not normal days
[21:18:12] <acdw> work week is 5
[21:18:12] <pussipupu> six, weirdly
[21:18:22] <huf> I think of 5 vacation days as a week since I already get the 2 weekend days off

[21:22:38] <acdw> bin: That's why I backtracked and said, the job should define "work week" 
[21:22:47] <acdw> and differentiate it in policy
[21:22:50] <bin> ah
[21:23:03] <bin> I've never worked anywhere that needed to do that, I guess.
[21:23:09] <bin> retail is expected to be 7 days
[21:23:16] <pussipupu> three weeks annual leave is really low though
[21:23:28] <pussipupu> maybe that's common in the US I guess
[21:23:37] <huf> how many days is that? 15? 21?
[21:23:55] <huf> let's get precise here :D
[21:24:03] <acdw> pussipupu it is common depressingly
[21:24:38] <acdw> I have 5 days of leave at my salaried position.  That's 5 Paid Time Off days that I can use when I would otherwise normally be working.  I.e., M-F
[21:25:13] <huf> the threat of communism really has done wonders for increasing paid leave :)
[21:27:49] <pussipupu> That's terrible, I'm sorry to hear it
[21:27:53] <pussipupu> Join a union
[21:28:04] <acdw> we haven't one
[21:28:23] <acdw> America is really crap, to be honest
[21:28:30] <bin> I like it
[21:28:42] <pussipupu> I'm almost certain there are unions in the US :p
[21:28:42] <bin> pussipupu: nah 3 weeks is pretty good. 
[21:28:57] <bin> that's not including holidays where the office is closed 
[21:29:50] <acdw> pussipupu: There isn't a union at my work.  And I'm salaried, which means a number of other things as well.
[21:30:09] <bin> yeah salary can be a blessing or a curse
[21:30:28] <bin> a blessing in my case because I work fewer hours, but a curse when the employer takes advantage and has you working tons of overtime for free
[21:30:43] <acdw> ^^
[21:31:42] <bin> unions too can be a blessing or a curse
[21:33:38] <pussipupu> being salaried doesn't imply unlimited working hours
[21:33:53] <pussipupu> Just how terrible is employment law in the US?
[21:34:15] <huf> very
[21:34:39] <pussipupu> Intellectually I know that but it still shocks me sometimes
[21:34:59] <huf> it probably also varies masssssively from place to place
[21:35:02] <huf> just US things
[21:37:29] <acdw> It's pretty bad pussipupu , but yes also varies.  The thing to remember about US law is that the US is basically the EU, but messier.
[21:37:40] <acdw> But state laws can vary by a lot.
[21:37:44] <huf> the eu isnt one country

[21:38:45] <pussipupu> Give it a little time and the US might not be either
[21:39:14] <acdw> Right, and I'm saying that the USA is less like one country than most others
[21:39:42] <acdw> Like, it started very much as a EU-type federation
[21:39:47] <pussipupu> Yeah and I get that, but it's worlds away from the EU
[21:40:12] <pussipupu> which is a bunch of independent countries, not a federal union
[21:41:11] <acdw> fair enough. My EU knowledge is ... not the best.  
[21:41:19] <acdw> apologies
[21:41:31] <huf> the eu is mainly a convenient way to sync up treaties between states

[21:41:56] <acdw> oh, yeah, that's quite different then. Thanks for the lesson!

[21:55:45] <bin> I think venmo has fees and PayPal does 
[21:56:04] <blkshp> I don't pay fees to paypal for using it's services non-commercially.
[21:56:05] <bin> but that's more for payment processing. Hence Zelle for sending money between friends
[21:56:12] <pussipupu> I have mixed feelings about it, it replaces merchant charges effectively
[21:56:21] <bin> blkshp: there are fees, you just don't pay them, the merchant does.
[21:56:56] <bin> but Zelle doesn't have fees on either side, although it can't be used legally for business transactions
