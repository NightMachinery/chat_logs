[02:06:38] <pyzozord> computer games are fine
[02:06:52] <pyzozord> it's not about computer games or any other for of recreation
[02:07:26] <novns> if you want recreation - play music, paint pictures, travel to new places
[02:07:37] <novns> there's a lot of things to do
[02:08:14] <novns> computer games make you fat and sad
[02:08:15] <pyzozord> I'm sorry novns but I think we have different worldviews
[02:09:08] <pyzozord> I don't think computer games makes you fat, or movies make you fat, or music makes you fat or books
[02:09:15] <pyzozord> bad diet makes you fat
[02:09:52] <pyzozord> maybe in some other cases video games somehow make people stay at home more
[02:09:59] <apotheon> Lack of physical activity of a sort that healthfully burns calories can also contribute.
[02:10:02] <novns> computer games are too addictive, you don't notice how you spend hours and hours
[02:10:06] <apotheon> It's not just how you eat.
[02:10:13] <pyzozord> but in my case it's the opposite I play video games because I stay at home, I don't stay at home because I play video games
[02:10:19] <mrig> your grandparents living habits at the time that your parents were conceived likely play a role too.
[02:10:37] <mrig> a considerable one.
[02:11:00] <apotheon> . . . although "addictive" in the case of video games can vary wildly, between games and between people.
[02:11:02] <pyzozord> novns: nonesense, 3h session either playing games or watching a movie or painting a picture is about standard
[02:11:26] <pyzozord> novns: again no offence, but sounds like a good advice for a teenager, in that case this really might be the case
[02:11:33] <novns> pyzozord, painting a picture is a creative process, it makes you brain work
[02:11:46] <mrig> and depression is like the weather, connected to a massive chaotic system that is very far removed from just chemicals in the brain and genetics.
[02:11:48] <pyzozord> playing videogames can make your game work a lot
[02:11:55] <pyzozord> *your brain
[02:11:58] <novns> playing a computer game is a lazy and meaningless thing
[02:12:03] <apotheon> Some games and movies make your brain work a fair bit . . . but rarely, and generally not as much.
[02:12:13] <independent56> Programming is a destrcutive process. It makes you angry, and in the case of haskell, kills it
[02:12:21] <independent56> *send you insane
[02:12:23] <mrig> butterfly effect can cure depression though, its a curious thing.
[02:12:26] <pyzozord> novns: yes, will not try to convince you of anything
[02:12:44] <novns> pyzozord, I'm sure you don't play chess, you play some stupid counter strike or something
[02:12:51] <apotheon> novns: Tell me some time how Rocksmith 2014 is lazy and meaningless.
[02:12:55] <pyzozord> my opinion is that there are deeper underlaying causes and drives that manifest as lifestyle choices
[02:12:58] <pyzozord> not the other way around
[02:13:24] <mrig> pyzozord: you know full well that I believe that too :D
[02:13:52] <novns> and painting pictures makes you feel good, you have some pictures to show off
[02:14:15] <novns> playing computer games is just spending time for nothing
[02:14:25] <perro_> much of what we do is
[02:14:28] <pyzozord> novns: I think you are just in a place in your life where these statements are helpful to you, in this case that's great you have a strong conviction
[02:14:34] <mrig> western style thought is often a little to wrapped up in other stuff to actually notice reality though :)

[02:19:25] <perro_> he was actually a nobleman with serfs, but his writing speaks for itself
[02:19:33] <mrig> pyzozord: it is not society's right to demand anything of anyone, and if people chose to live in a hermetic way, why would that be an issue?
[02:19:35] <perro_> he lived a very modest life at the end
[02:20:21] <mrig> it is society's burden to understand human nature fully, if it does not want to undergo the cycle of collapse.
[02:20:23] <pyzozord> mrig: if you live in a society you benefit from the society and you must contribute
[02:20:33] <mrig> It is suppose to serve all types not just some.

[02:51:32] <epony> novns, so, then creating a video game that makes others unhappy is the result of intentional defects in it then

[02:54:28] <pyzozord> I agree that unfortunately games are far more commercialized (thus degenerateed down to the lowest instincts) than paintings, but against movies it's not so obvious

[10:45:52] <Decker> ProfSimm like ARM does 
[10:46:06] <ProfSimm> Decker: how does it
[10:46:40] <Decker> instructions have 2 bits... that if either flag is set in the flags register, they skip those instructions - so there's no branching, it just falls over instructions
[10:46:56] <Decker> 2 is more flexible than 1 for cases of nested branches

[10:48:01] <Decker> then reverse the flag

[10:50:21] <Decker> dekwakre's script language basically works that way - there's 2 flags 'find else' and 'find end'   if the /if success is true, then it doesn't set anything, until the /else in which case itsets the 'find end' when it gets there... otherwise it sets 'find else' which skips all instructions until the else, which clears the flag, and then falls theough the rest of the code

The comma is identical to then "then" part of if/then/else, it orders the sequence and continues only if the previous evaluates to "exists/true". Its also identical to the AND operator which has the same semantics. So this means the ELSE and OR resp. can be seen as  branchi

[11:24:31] <rm_rf> You're referring to the logic course I took? 
[11:25:07] <ProfSimm> Decker: the interesting thing is that it kinda is like that. If we all talk about a concept all the time, it starts to shape our thinking. It becomes a piece of state in our world, that shapes it, bends it, sometimes control flow goes to it
[11:25:21] <rm_rf> I was a philosophy major so we took logic to help out with our arguments and reasoning. I wasn't a math student. For some reason, I didn't do too great with math using numbers but did really well in logic 
[11:25:32] <ProfSimm> Decker: functions are kinda like that, because it takes effort to even try and unthink about functions
[11:26:22] <Decker> ya.... repeated code modules - why do legos exist?
[11:26:23] <rm_rf> I ordered the symbolic logic book we used though ... Found it on Amazon. I don't remember any of it from decades ago. I know the basic Aristotilean arguments and forms but the complex stuff, I'd have to study up on it again.

[11:30:46] <rm_rf> There's a great chasm between those who can and cannot program well and this has a lot to do with the technically savvy people on the "can-do" end not being able to communicate with those outside of themselves.

[12:33:53] <ProfSimm> I think

[12:34:09] <ProfSimm> By the type system

[13:21:38] <pyzozord> Was Church the one who invented lambda calculus?
[13:21:39] <ProfSimm> The church encoding kinda forces you into lazy execution tho
[13:21:50] <bjs> ProfSimm: it's a fine representation of booleans, but church encodings are again not a nice thing to work with as a programmer, generally
[13:21:54] <bjs> pyzozord: yes.
[13:21:57] <pyzozord> Omg my autocorrect now suggests lambda and calculus lol
[13:21:58] <ProfSimm> As in you don't wanna evaluate earlier. You can keep piling closures into one another

[13:23:01] <ProfSimm> bjs: we just haven't found the right high level
[13:23:02] <pyzozord> Yes, and i bet these church boolean are "in the category of endofunctors"
[13:23:05] <bjs> ProfSimm: sure,  using functions to represent structure is a common thing in functional programming and that's all church encodings are.  But like with everything, the question is about moderation
[13:23:26] <bjs> abstractions are a nice thing that make programmers lives easier, not harder :P

[13:29:55] <ProfSimm> bjs: maybe I can rephrase this. You have types, but the basic values are all 1 type, which is a set of interfaces implementing bool, int, list, set, map and so on

[13:30:39] <ProfSimm> bjs: I don't know how you can rephrase it either. We're stuck
[13:31:00] <bjs> ProfSimm: well the whole point of a type system is to assign types to things so that you can reject some programs as type unsound

[13:31:57] <ProfSimm> bjs: let me put it this way. In most programs types whether static or dynamic, are like a sum type.

[22:05:51] <sonny> didn't show any reason to believe they made 38k but wow if true
[22:05:52] <Amadiro> NFTs have some cool ideas in them like paying a portion of every sale back to the original creator... they just kinda suck in practice
[22:06:05] <sonny> Amadiro that's old lol
[22:06:19] <sonny> it's called royalties
[22:06:42] <GeDaMo> The problem is you can't tell if the NFT was made by the creator of the artwork
[22:07:03] <Amadiro> sonny, I guess. That's a bit of a different model though, since it's licensing. I guess it blurs the line between owning and licensing

[22:08:25] <sonny> GeDaMo that would require the artist to [digitally] sign the media right?
[22:09:04] <GeDaMo> I'm not really sure that helps
[22:09:08] <Amadiro> they could do that, but it'd arguably just push the problem a level higher, because now you need a registry of publickeys of artists
[22:09:20] <Amadiro> which is not that different from the artist just straight up having an ethereum wallet or whatever

[22:09:44] <sonny> GeDaMo I'm just thinking about how artists sign their works irl
[22:10:12] <sonny> but yeah I guess the signature doesn't establish the artists is who they say they are
[22:10:15] <GeDaMo> How do you prevent someone stripping the digital signature?
[22:10:27] <sonny> oh
[22:10:38] <GeDaMo> This is the same problem that media companies have been working on for decades
[22:10:43] <wedr> Yesterday, I asked about Angular and a pickling issue regarding how the our customer wanted Angular to act as a middleware, sending requests from a machine and passing that machine's request to the server. Well, that whole Angular thing is somewhat fixed. I just made a lazy approach to authentication by asking the machine give Angular some extra info.

[22:10:55] <sonny> wow
[22:10:57] <sonny> I see
[22:10:58] <Amadiro> well, in practice with physical art it's a chain of trust and chain of custody. You trust that the piece of art has only gone through people who are sufficiently honest (or incentivised to be honest) and reasonably authenticated (reduces incentive to lie)
