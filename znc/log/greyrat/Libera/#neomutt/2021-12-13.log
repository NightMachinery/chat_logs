[15:20:00] <flatcap> morning all
[15:28:09] <gahr> hi flatcap 
[15:28:21] <flatcap> hi gahr 
[15:28:43] <flatcap> thanks for the fixes :-)
[15:29:47] <flatcap> I finally dived into the TAILQ defects over the weekend
[15:30:03] <flatcap> no good news, but I did discover one strange thing...
[15:30:14] <flatcap> https://github.com/neomutt/neomutt/blob/master/email/parse.c#L250-L251
[15:31:00] <flatcap> I saw that and decided to change it to
[15:31:12] <flatcap> struct ParameterList pl = TAILQ_HEAD_INITIALIZER(pl);
[15:31:32] <flatcap> and Coverity gave me a *extra* defect!
[15:35:04] <gahr> oh interesting
[15:35:25] <gahr> that can't be right, right?
[15:35:51] <flatcap> yes, that can't be right :-)
[15:37:01] <flatcap> it seems that Coverity *will* monitor `x = TAILQ_HEAD_INITIALIZER(x)`, but not `x; TAILQ_INIT(x)`
[15:37:14] <flatcap> but I only have one data point
[15:38:32] <flatcap> I found a FreeBSD kernel wiki, where they complained about Coverity + TAILQ
[15:38:40] <flatcap> (A TODO from years ago)
[15:39:27] <flatcap> https://wiki.freebsd.org/CoverityPrevent
[15:40:19] <flatcap> I wonder if anyone would know what their workaround was
[15:48:51] <flatcap> (sorry, gotta pop out.  back in a bit)
[16:03:13] <Martin[XMPP]> I saved a message locally as txt and didn't realize that the mail will be gone from the mailbox afterwards. Is there a way to reimport the message from the txt file?

[16:07:03] <gahr> how did you save it as a text file?
[16:08:55] <gahr> if you used <save-message>, it creates a mbox or maildir.. you chould be able to <change-folder> into it and save your message back to your original mailbox
[16:09:14] <Martin[XMPP]> Pressed `s` (safe-message) and put `~/example.txt` as target.
[16:10:10] <gahr> what's your mbox_type?
[16:10:32] <Martin[XMPP]> gahr, worked, thanks
[16:10:37] <gahr> nice
[16:11:21] <Martin[XMPP]> `c` ~/path/to/mail.txt and then I did my `copy to archive` command it's in the archive. Phew.
[16:32:15] <Martin[XMPP]> I think I should have used `<copy-message>` instead of `<save-message>`.
[16:33:39] <Martin[XMPP]> Probably a stupid question, but I didn't find the answer by searching the neomutt docs: How can I use a command which has no keybinding, e.g. `<copy-message>`? Typing it after `:` neomutt says `unkown command`…

[17:14:24] <gahr> hi flatcap 
[17:15:26] <flatcap> hi
[17:17:20] <gahr> the notes on TAILQ on the freebsd/coverity wiki page date back to 2007
[17:17:39] <flatcap> yeah
[17:18:01] <gahr> I would just stop caring :)
[17:18:11] <flatcap> :-)
[17:19:42] <flatcap> I'll triage them as false-positives, later
