[01:49:58] <mario-goulart> That was a disappointly stupid user error.
[01:50:50] <mario-goulart> I was giving an http url and the user was using https.

[18:25:12] <Corbin> curium: Some spammer posts spam to paste.call-cc.org, vandusen announces the paste, judybot reads the paste and determines that it's spam.
[18:27:03] <curium> that is sort of peculiar .. the freeeee thing
[18:55:33] <wasamasa> yeah
[18:55:46] <wasamasa> normally you'd just improve pastiche's spam filter
[18:56:11] <wasamasa> but as there has been no progress on that front, I decided to write a bot to automate the remaining spam checking
[18:56:54] <wasamasa> what I've considered is to go a step further and immediately report the material the spammer is posting
[18:57:00] <wasamasa> that would probably annoy them a good deal more
[18:58:18] <Corbin> wasamasa: If you have a reliable way to detect the spam, you can annoy them even more. One classic trick is to slow down their TCP connection to a trickle, so that it takes minutes or hours to submit spam.
[18:58:36] <wasamasa> I have, yes
[18:59:09] <wasamasa> but the thing is that I have no control over the deployed version of pastiche doing the spam checking
[18:59:51] <wasamasa> I've submitted a PR (which was merged and later detected to be erroneous
