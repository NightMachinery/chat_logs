[01:42:04] <klaxa> but i'd have to mix the background with the sax this way it's already mixed
[01:42:20] <Fenderbassist> vegii: thanks, also saved
[01:49:33] <lastonestanding> Fenderbassist: do you try to find new artists/bands or do you prefer the old and established?
[01:50:18] <Nanobot> You come before the pigman king. He's the most disgusting thing you've ever seen in your life. The pigman wizard casts a magic spell that turns the pigman king into a beautiful woman who wants you to make love to her. There is an x% chance that the spell will be broken before you finish. What is the highest value of x at which you would agree to do it?

[02:04:28] <vegii> and ketchup as a vegetable
[02:04:45] <Nanobot> It's a salad consisting of tomato, carrot, zucchini, and cheese strips. I'm guessing they looked at the cheese strips, mistook them for lettuce, and just skipped the lettuce.
[02:05:02] <amigojapan> Ketchup was meant to replace tomatoes
[02:05:08] <lastonestanding> Fenderbassist: do you ever tried live looping?
[02:05:42] <vegii> ketchup was a chinese fish sauce I heard

[02:10:20] <vegii> > As the century progressed, tomato ketchup began its ascent in popularity in the United States. Ketchup was popular long before fresh tomatoes were. People were less hesitant to eat tomatoes as part of a highly processed product that had been cooked and infused with vinegar and spices.

[02:18:09] <lastonestanding> I don't understand why reducing the intake of fat is bad
[02:18:13] <amigojapan> lastonestanding: this seems to be working
[02:18:51] <lastonestanding> fat makes you fat after all
[02:18:56] <lastonestanding> correct?
[02:19:12] <Fenderbassist> dietary fat doesn't equal body fat
[02:19:23] <amigojapan> Low fat and low sugar
[02:19:32] <Fenderbassist> however eating a lot of calorie dense food will pack on the pounds
[02:19:44] <lastonestanding> how that?
[02:19:45] <Fenderbassist> so you have to balance calories with the food types(s) you do best with
[02:20:09] <lastonestanding> doesn't our body only store fat?

[09:24:30] <ButterNoodle> find me another repo and use it
[09:24:32] <ButterNoodle> but

[09:26:19] <ButterNoodle> was gonna install it on my arch remote desktop but its like 750meg w all the dependencies
[09:26:34] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: it seems the trick to listening when you lock the screen is to use the desktop version of YouTube
[09:28:38] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: better use Firefox cause they are running into trouble because of losing users
[09:28:49] <ButterNoodle> where are they going?
[09:29:13] <amigojapan> The company is shrinking
[09:29:38] <amigojapan> But I guess it is open source anyway
[09:30:43] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: the users? They are switching to some incarnation of chromium
[09:30:46] <ButterNoodle> what is taking market.. chrome?
[09:30:51] <ButterNoodle> ic
[09:31:16] <ButterNoodle> then firefox will reinvent them self and be the big browser again

[13:43:09] <Sadale> I'm not entirely sure. But the dumbest kind of power button is just a couple of shorted contact points. So you just need to short the two contacts somehow... ?

[13:55:04] <Sadale> MootPoot, If the contact's exposed somehow, then you might be able to power it xD

[14:10:15] <Sapphirus> oh crikey 
[14:10:52] <Sadale> Sapphirus, It's actually a PC with a custom case that a monitor is mounted onto it. It's huge compared with a normal laptop tho. It offers better portability than conventional PC tower, at a cost of less customizability because I can't install dedicated graphic card on that nor 3.5" HDD.
[14:11:12] <Sapphirus> There's no SSDs?
[14:11:29] <Sadale> There is a 2.5" drive slot. I've installed SSD onto it

[14:12:41] <MootPoot> to use the single cells in different projects
[14:12:45] <Sadale> It's a bomb. don't! xD

[14:12:50] <MootPoot> lol
[14:13:07] <MootPoot> I can feel the soft battery pack - there are 3 seperate cells in there
[14:13:10] <Sadale> Could contain toxic chemicals inside.
[14:13:25] <MootPoot> Sadale: well, I'm not gonnna open the cells...just the pack
[14:13:29] <Sapphirus> burning lithium batteries aren't good for theeeeee
[14:14:02] <Sadale> I'd rather not to risk that. But you could try if you want. Make sure to read up info on how the battery works beforeward.

[14:17:31] <MootPoot> these cheap celeron laptops dont even have a sata slot
[14:17:54] <Sadale> :O
[14:18:07] <Sadale> how did they connect the HDD with the laptop then?
[14:18:11] <MootPoot> although some of them take a nvme storage
[14:18:13] <Sadale> Back then there was no nvme
[14:18:19] <MootPoot> they use m.2
[14:18:27] <Sadale> Oh you aren't talking about your old celeron laptop.
[14:18:33] <Sapphirus> It's hilarious how m.2 storage is cheaper now than sata ssd storage
[14:18:34] <Sadale> oh wait yours isn't celeron but an i5
[14:18:45] <MootPoot> I was just looking at new ones
[14:18:55] <Sadale> Sapphirus, I find it sad. I dunno. I somehow thinks that SATA's more "standard". :-(

[14:20:43] <Sapphirus> Maybe some additional chips for SATA, but that's it.
[14:20:45] <Sadale> Sapphirus, Maybe that's why it's more expensive than NVME SSD
[14:20:46] * MootPoot almost throws his 18TB 3.5" HDD at Sadale but stops because its too expensive
[14:21:02] <Sadale> lol
[14:21:13] <Sapphirus> Sadale, perhaps, but in the $100s of dollars more expensive seems a bit ridiculous

[15:10:34] <Sapphirus> Manjaro behaves just like Arch in the respect that it's 'rolling release', except it freezes packages and whatnot.
[15:11:00] <MootPoot> its manjaro 21.2.0-211220
[15:11:12] <Sapphirus> What's happening here is that you've got an out of date keyring with an out of date version of patchelf 
[15:11:39] <Sapphirus> yeah, scratch what I said earlier.
[15:12:01] <Sapphirus> I was a bit confused on how Manjaro's release system worked.
[15:13:14] <Sapphirus> In other words, these packages are out-of-date and it's causing a regression due to an expired key.
[15:13:39] <Sapphirus> Manjaro for whatever reason hasn't gotten around to fixing this.
[15:13:53] <MootPoot> just wait then?
[15:14:32] <Sapphirus> Either wait or you can install Arch in a lightweight console-only VM to build it

[15:21:46] <MootPoot> we know they're worse but
[15:21:56] <MootPoot> if you only have one shot them 
[15:21:57] <MootPoot> then
[15:22:02] <MootPoot> maybe they'll last longer

[15:30:54] <MootPoot> cum on it then wipe with a towel
[15:31:56] <Sapphirus> I have an old dead hard drive I want to take apart just to have a look on the inside.
[15:32:11] <Sapphirus> WD Black that died on me not soon after I got it
[15:32:15] <amigojapan> Sapphirus: I am sure there is a utility for that or you could do cat /Dev/zero > mountpoint after blanking it. That works fill it with zeros
[15:32:28] <Sapphirus> I'm using shred, amigojapan.
[15:32:35] <amigojapan> I see
[15:32:36] <MootPoot> I just zero fill twice and call it a day
[15:32:49] <Sapphirus> From what I gather, it just pulls from /dev/random and writes over the disk 3 times by default.
[15:32:54] <Sapphirus> Which is good enough for my uses.
[15:32:55] <amigojapan> MootPoot: why twice?
[15:33:11] <Sapphirus> For magnetic media, it should ensure data security.
[15:33:16] <MootPoot> ^
[15:33:21] <amigojapan> Ah ok
[15:33:27] <Sapphirus> Especially for a magnetic disk in a datacenter I can't physically access.
[15:33:28] <MootPoot> I assumed you were talking about spinny bois
[15:33:33] <MootPoot> not sds
[15:33:34] <MootPoot> ssds
[15:33:46] <MootPoot> idk how to wipe ssds properly, I haven't needed to
[15:34:22] <amigojapan> MootPoot: only once is enough for ssds, filling then with zeros
[15:35:15] <Sapphirus> You can just write /dev/random once with shred instead of three times like with an HDD.
[15:35:35] <Sapphirus> Writing zeros isn't guaranteed to actually remove the data from the nand cells.
[15:35:47] <Sapphirus> Firmware may actually just mark the cells as free and return zeros.
[15:36:05] <Sapphirus> You wouldn't really be able to tell very easily if that's what it was doing.
[15:36:25] <Sapphirus> To avoid that, use /dev/random for SSDs, instead, but beware of NAND wear. :P

[16:30:23] <MootPoot> I think I know why my head hurts and I haven't managed to get anything done
[16:30:25] <amigojapan> !x 1977 + 8
[16:30:43] <amigojapan> !c 1977 + 8
[16:30:44] <Sapphirus> I wasn't born until a decade after at least, amigojapan.
[16:30:44] <ImoutoBot> amigojapan: 1985
[16:30:48] <MootPoot> I dropped out of keto because I've been too lazy to go shopping 
[16:31:12] <amigojapan> Sapphirus: yeah, it used BASIC programming langaues as the OS

[16:31:39] <Sapphirus> that's neat. I like watching youtube videos of vintage computers to take a trip to that past I never got to experience.

[16:36:53] <Matt|home> what's the easiest option

[16:45:40] * MootPoot is confused on what he's being congratulated on
[16:46:02] <Sapphirus> My elementary and high school used netware long after it was probably considered abandonware
[16:46:02] <ButterNoodle> 4 was ipx only unless u bought the ip license iirc
[16:46:10] <ButterNoodle> and I ran 5 native ip
[16:46:28] <MootPoot> ButterNoodle: me and Sapphirus (mostly him) discovered that manjaro be slackin today
[16:46:29] <Sapphirus> IT staff there were a bunch of old cranky guys that didn't want to adapt
[16:46:34] <ButterNoodle> it was good at what it did, until microsoft copied its funcitons
[16:46:38] <MootPoot> Sapphirus: that's like 80% of us
[16:46:43] <MootPoot> on the network side
[16:46:45] <ButterNoodle> MootPoot: woah manjaro is now slacware?
[16:46:48] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: what exactly was novel , was it an OS? I guess it was a file server
[16:47:05] <Sapphirus> ButterNoodle, it's hilarious to see Manjaro with broken packages.
[16:47:10] <ButterNoodle> it was an os that was basically a dedicated file server
[16:47:17] <ButterNoodle> Sapphirus: lol
[16:47:21] <ButterNoodle> those manjaro folks
[16:47:29] <amigojapan> ah ok ButterNoodle, you should make a video showing that
[16:47:35] <Sapphirus> Of all the edge cases MootPoot could've ran into.. lol
[16:47:58] <ButterNoodle> amigojapan: it was strange.. u booted dos 6.22, then ran the netware kernel
[16:47:58] <MootPoot> Sapphirus: my entire experience with linux is running into edge cases....ask butter about the boot partition
[16:48:10] <ButterNoodle> MootPoot: I dont remember
[16:48:11] <MootPoot> the fuckery that had to be done
[16:48:16] <MootPoot> ButterNoodle: remember when we called on discord
[16:48:17] <ButterNoodle> I see stuff like that all the time
[16:48:23] <Sapphirus> This edge case is Manjaro's fault for neglecting to update packages.
[16:48:25] <MootPoot> installing arch on that laptop
[16:48:31] <ButterNoodle> did we arch-chroot to fix?
[16:48:38] <ButterNoodle> oh shit
[16:48:40] <ButterNoodle> the dev names
[16:48:41] <MootPoot> we did but it kept failing to actually make the thing
[16:48:43] <MootPoot> yea
[16:48:46] <MootPoot> you remember now
[16:48:48] <ButterNoodle> yea I member
[16:49:01] <Sapphirus> I broke arch for fun with a friend watching awhile back
[16:49:13] <ButterNoodle> is that like NTR arc?
[16:49:16] <ButterNoodle> is that like NTR arch?
[16:49:18] <MootPoot> woah
[16:49:19] <Sapphirus> Installed apt-get and dpkg in an arch vm to see what could go wrong for shits and giggles
[16:49:30] <Sapphirus> I wanted to fuck it up on purpose for some fun.
[16:49:48] <MootPoot> I've broken debian installs by running a single command
[16:50:01] <MootPoot> apt get upgrade && update
[16:50:11] <MootPoot> what it does, no idea
[16:50:12] <Sapphirus> Debian can break itself, yeah, so don't worry yourself too much about it.
[16:50:12] <ButterNoodle> Sapphirus: #metoo me and Bco1981 were trying to get his sound workin, and I figured it was that kernel that has some support issue - so I was trying to help him invoke the wayback machine
[16:50:29] <ButterNoodle> in the process I rolled my test vm back to 2020
[16:50:38] <ButterNoodle> *it works
[16:50:43] <ButterNoodle> not great, but it works
[16:51:18] <Sapphirus> Installing Arch from Debian was a recent adventure which succeeded.
[16:51:29] <ButterNoodle> glibc downgrade was interesting - as the current one couldnt build the initcpio image.. so it was borked till I chrooted and reran
[16:51:37] <ButterNoodle> Sapphirus: that sound fun
[16:51:57] <Sapphirus> Even was an out of date version of Debian, so far more fun.
[16:51:58] <ButterNoodle> kinda like LFS from slackware
[16:53:45] <Sapphirus> Funny thing is, ButterNoodle, it actually went about as smooth as installing Arch from a live cd.
[16:53:54] <ButterNoodle> rly
[16:54:06] <MootPoot> where do I email manjaro to tell them to fix their shit
[16:54:10] <Sapphirus> Yeah, because the bootstrap script is distribution agnostic.
[16:54:20] <Sapphirus> Or so at least the one I used.
[16:54:23] <MootPoot> "Shits Borked" - MootPoot, 2020.
[16:54:36] <Sapphirus> Then you chroot into it like normal, with only a few extra steps.
[16:54:43] <amigojapan> MootPoot:there is endless shit to fix in manjaro
[16:54:47] <Sapphirus> Debian contains all the normal tools you need for setting everything up prior to bootstrapping and chrooting.
[16:54:58] <amigojapan> MootPoot:dont waste your time
[16:55:07] <Sapphirus> I also installed Arch onto physical hardware from a virtual machine before.
[16:55:27] <Matt|home> sigh. "i wanna watch a video!" computers: "go do these 500000 steps" me: "oh ok.." let's see if this works..
[16:55:30] <Sapphirus> Attached the physical disk into the VM and installed it in the VM from my terminal through virtual serial.
[16:55:32] <Sapphirus> Glorious. 
[16:56:29] <Sapphirus> This something I contrived on my own with limited documentation for the individual components involved.
[16:56:49] <Sapphirus> It's not something someone would normally do 
[16:57:19] <Sapphirus> By limited documentation, I mean the most important part: Passing through a block device into a VM.
[16:57:39] <sokill> you can shut your leg from behind but what the point?
[16:58:27] <Sapphirus> Oh, it worked out just fine. I was able to bootstrap my new drive whilst bickering to people and listening to YouTube.
[16:59:14] <amigojapan> MootPoot: manjaro was nothing but frustration
[16:59:26] <amigojapan> MootPoot: you will get ot hate linux that way
[16:59:45] <Sapphirus> Manjaro was a contender for a family member's machine I want to migrate away from Windows.
[17:00:03] <Sapphirus> Now that's out the window.
[17:00:13] <amigojapan> Sapphirus: I super recommend not going with a rolling distro
[17:00:16] <Sapphirus> I don't want to deal with the stupid edge cases they introduce because of how they selectively freeze packages.
[17:00:33] <Sapphirus> amigojapan, that's the irony of Manjaro, technically it's both rolling and stable.
[17:00:34] <amigojapan> Sapphirus:  manjaro keeps on braking on updates

[17:00:56] <Sapphirus> They call themselves a rolling-release distribution, yet they have 'stable' releases.
[17:01:00] <Sapphirus> It's astoundingly confusing.
[17:01:25] <Sapphirus> When I was talking to MootPoot at first about it, I got mixed up because of this.
[17:01:33] <amigojapan> Sapphirus: they claim to test stuff, that sall, before releasing
[17:01:58] <Sapphirus> When they end up being more unstable and buggy than Arch Linux, then they've successfully failed at doing that.

[17:12:15] <Poeticode> oh yeah I saw that Sapphirus lmao what the hell is M$ doing/thinking
[17:12:32] <Sapphirus> Well, it's basically that they're losing market share to mobile/tablets.
[17:13:22] <Sapphirus> Which has been happening for a long time, so now they want to milk whatever they can out of their remaining user base.
[17:13:29] <isekaijin> They had an abusive monopoly in the 90's and early 2000's, but at least they had it by making better software than most of the competition.
[17:13:49] <Sapphirus> Internet Exploder and ActiveX was cursed
[17:13:59] <isekaijin> But nowadays Windows is plainly bad.
[17:14:07] <amigojapan> Sapphirus: their normal user base will likely be hardcore gamers and businesses
[17:14:41] <Sapphirus> amigojapan, which is going to make it interesting, because hardcore gamers are likely to be tinkerers. 
[17:15:00] <Sapphirus> With the SteamDeck doing as well as it is, Microsoft better not let that arrogance sink themselves.
[17:15:29] <amigojapan> Sapphirus: forcing everyone to buy a new computer with TPM 2.0
[17:15:58] <Sapphirus> Whilst I wouldn't count on a full-on collapse of that demographic, I'd say that they're likely to be alienate a enough people in the 'hardcore gamer' demographic.
[17:16:02] <isekaijin> The business market will always be profitable. In the worst case (for them), they will become the next IBM.

[17:16:33] <Sapphirus> isekaijin, that may be their last place where they hold any relevance.
[17:17:04] <Sapphirus> Best case scenario if Microsoft gets too arrogant is maybe 3-10% share for Linux
[17:17:13] <isekaijin> As long as the money from the consulting contracts comes in...
[17:17:30] <isekaijin> 10% market share for desktop Linux isn't happening anytime soon.

[17:17:39] <isekaijin> Heck, 3% isn't happening anytime soon.
[17:17:41] <Sapphirus> Linux still isn't that userfriendly for a lot of people

[17:20:23] <Poeticode> hell even at my software dev workplaces, everybody runs windows/mac, with _maybe_ one crazy dev running a weird Arch setup
[17:20:24] <isekaijin> Also, even among the students who are interested in things like competitive programming (surprisingly not dominated by informatics students), the most popular OS is still Windows.
[17:20:38] <Sapphirus> Poeticode, why is one crazy for using Arch?
[17:20:40] <ezekielnoob> amigojapan oh i see
[17:20:59] <amigojapan> ezekielnoob: Japanese change fashion like they change underware
[17:21:04] <Sapphirus> maybe I've already answered that with my ramblings
[17:21:06] <Poeticode> Sapphirus just a stereotype lol
[17:21:29] <mixfix41> i dont think that is true at all just look at libera. programmers are basically all using linux.
[17:21:31] <Sapphirus> isekaijin, competitive programming can be toxic.
[17:21:36] <amigojapan> ezekielnoob: the last time I checked , something called dekora was teh latest fashion in harajuku
[17:21:42] <Poeticode> One is not crazy for running Arch, but the crazy devs who might burn down the workplace before leaving will be running Arch
[17:21:50] <mixfix41> and if on windows their backbone is in linux otherwise its hard to follow
[17:21:52] <Sapphirus> mixfix41, to be incredibly fair, you have to be a special breed of person to be on IRC in 2022.
[17:22:24] <amigojapan> Sapphirus: I have just been on IRC since 1992
[17:22:34] <Sapphirus> far longer than I have.
[17:22:38] <Sapphirus> I've been on it since like the mid 2010s
[17:23:01] <Sapphirus> You're truly an internet native. :P
[17:23:17] <isekaijin> Sapphirus: Sure, it's a sport, and sporting contests can get... uh... heated.
[17:23:17] <Poeticode> I've been on IRC forevers and run Fedora so I'm a crazy dev :(
[17:23:27] <amigojapan> Sapphirus: I also used BBSs before the internet
[17:23:58] <KatrinValerie> isekaijin: who's dominating those contests? math students?
[17:24:03] * amigojapan tips his hat to  Poeticode
[17:24:12] <Sapphirus> isekaijin, one thing that always dissuaded me from programming communities, or maybe the ones I was around, was the toxicity instead of actual critique.
[17:24:38] <Sapphirus> Instead of laying out a proper critique, everyone would just call people's code shit.
[17:24:44] <isekaijin> KatrinValerie: That used to be the case a few years ago. But now there's no dominant major.
[17:25:01] <KatrinValerie> Sapphirus: you can't expect getting spoon fed
[17:25:12] <KatrinValerie> But yeah, programming communities used to be pretty toxic
[17:25:20] <Sapphirus> No, but you also can't expect people to know what they're doing wrong if you don't explain yourslef.
[17:25:24] <KatrinValerie> The Python discord is refreshingly different

[17:25:40] <Sapphirus> It made me quite reclusive and not a community participant.
[17:25:49] <KatrinValerie> Sapphirus: obviously not, tbh the most toxic community was the linux one
[17:25:50] <isekaijin> Sapphirus: Programmers have an incentive to shit on technologies they haven't invested / specialized in.
[17:25:54] <Poeticode> elixir's community has been pretty naisu
[17:26:13] <mixfix41> i only assume they are using linux because the best teachers can use ide well so its about using an ide well and sharing their screen i think.

[17:44:21] <amigojapan> Zoidberg: super long term
[17:44:29] <Sadale> manpower.
[17:44:35] <Sadale> Manpower is probably the main cost saved.
[17:45:13] <Sadale> Arguably tho it takes more skill to maintain the e-ink pricetag updating system if it has to be maintained
[17:45:26] <amigojapan> Zoidberg: MootPoot prices hardly ever really go up here only during the time I was here twice with the introduction of new consumption tax laws
[17:45:33] <Sadale> So the per-hour cost of e-ink pricetag maintenance would be far higher than label printing
[17:45:39] <Sadale> per-hour manpower cost
[17:46:09] <amigojapan> They have always been expensive
[17:46:54] <Sadale> yes. That's the point of using e-ink paper. By using e-ink paper you just develop the software to automatically update the pricetag instead of getting someone to manually swap the label.
[17:47:22] <amigojapan> Zoidberg: technological advancements are not needed for everything
[17:47:22] <Zoidberg> I see amigojapan. It's not like that in other countries
[17:47:45] <Sadale> It saves the time required on swapping the label. Assuming it takes 30 seconds to swap a label, swapping 100 labels would cost almost an hour of labor cost.
[17:48:07] <Sadale> And you have to do that like maybe once a week. It adds up.

[18:21:38] <ButterNoodle> since we have advanced symbols now
[18:21:40] <Sadale> lol
[18:21:49] <ButterNoodle> cat ears for yen
[18:22:15] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: apparently the us first currency was called something like "American pesos"
[18:22:30] <Sadale> ButterNoodle, Wouldn't ezekielnoob be using a currency that has a taco icon for its symbol then? Except that it has a PH written on the taco.
[18:22:43] <ButterNoodle> the first us currency was the blood of my enemies..
[18:22:45] <amigojapan> according to wikipedia at least
[18:22:45] <ButterNoodle> wait
[18:22:59] <ButterNoodle> they just killed the natives :<
[18:23:07] <amigojapan> yup
[18:23:42] <ButterNoodle> I mean at least when my people came and conquered.. we just raped an pillaged.. we didnt kill em all and take their land too
[18:23:59] <Sadale> booooooooooo

[18:24:43] <ButterNoodle> however, is it more brutal to leave behind our ice blooded spawn in the bellies of the natives?
[18:24:45] <Sadale> There's a limited amount of ammo, isn't it?

[18:25:11] <ButterNoodle> Sadale: limited ammo? today or in 1492 when columbus sailed the ocean blue
[18:25:17] <ButterNoodle> amigojapan: yes
[18:25:22] <Sadale> ButterNoodle, 1942
[18:25:22] <ButterNoodle> god said they deserved it
[18:25:26] <Sadale> ButterNoodle, 1492 *
[18:25:36] <Sadale> Oh was there even gun?
[18:25:38] <ButterNoodle> 1942 when hitler sailed the ocean blue..
[18:25:41] <Sadale> I mean like firearm
[18:25:44] <ButterNoodle> Sadale: muskets
[18:26:00] <ButterNoodle> no cartridges for quite a few years
[18:27:08] <ButterNoodle> first "modern" cartridge was in the late 1800s
[18:27:37] <Sadale> ah.
[18:27:43] <ButterNoodle> to which one is still in production. the 45-70, used to kill many men and buffalos
[18:27:50] <Sadale> Still wouldn't the invader be outnumbered by natives?
[18:28:07] <ButterNoodle> well when u show up bringing gifts 
[18:28:10] <ButterNoodle> and are all nice
[18:28:12] <Sadale> LOL
[18:28:16] <ButterNoodle> then say get off my lawn

[18:29:18] <ButterNoodle> american natives spent centuries learning to get along with each others different tribes
[18:29:31] <Sadale> oh. Right. They settle there first. And they develop an economy and military supply chain right in the America.
[18:29:37] <ButterNoodle> so they werent the bloody savages that american history made them out to be
[18:29:42] <Sadale> I mean the invader*
[18:29:57] <Sadale> I see. sad.
[18:29:58] <ButterNoodle> yea they came w ships, guns, disease, and religion
[18:31:03] <Sadale> In modern warfare apparently the one with stronger firearm doesn't always win. The defender often have an advantage.
[18:31:36] <ButterNoodle> yes and the natives with primitive weapons defended their land well all things considered
[18:31:44] <ButterNoodle> that being said
[18:32:07] <Sadale> And the natives know the terrain much better than the invader.
[18:32:22] <ButterNoodle> saxons were in america long before history says europeans setteled it
[18:32:38] <Sadale> And the native has access to the the supply right inside their land. The invader has to supply their shit from their home country.

[21:26:54] <MootPoot> KatrinValerie: you dont have EuroDOCSIS?
[21:26:55] <Bco1981> she wanted something to remember you by.

[21:27:31] <KatrinValerie> Oh, yes that exists but is more expensive
[21:27:43] <KatrinValerie> and the cable providers have no service at all
[21:27:51] <MootPoot> docsis is the default here
[21:27:59] <MootPoot> either docsis or fiber
[21:28:19] <MootPoot> the poor fuckers who live out of the cities/towns are stuck with using ADSL though
[21:28:30] <MootPoot> or mobile broadband / starlink
[21:29:38] <emmeka> haha, you think I get DSL
[21:29:40] <emmeka> ;~;
[21:30:01] <Bco1981> don't tell us you are still on dialup?
[21:30:02] <MootPoot> I added mobile broadband in there for you
[21:30:11] <MootPoot> Bco1981: afaik he uses some wireless bullshit
[21:30:17] <MootPoot> CDMA or something
[21:30:20] <MootPoot> EV-DO?
[21:30:35] <MootPoot> god those were shit
[21:30:39] <emmeka> Bco1981 no, there's a local company that does WiMax-based fixed wireless, they have towers all over the valley
[21:30:50] <MootPoot> ah, thats what it was
[21:30:51] <MootPoot> Wimax
[21:31:02] <Bco1981> ah, wimax...
[21:31:21] <MootPoot> emmeka: I was checking out internet around here and it seems like its either a 3g usb modem thing, or ADSL
[21:31:32] <emmeka> for some reason I can't get DSL
[21:31:47] <emmeka> and you may ask, but emmeka, is there no landline service to your house?
[21:32:14] <emmeka> and, there is. the cable is still run and everything. but there's just no ISP running DSL to my specific area, for some reason
[21:32:21] <Bco1981> fuckin' finally. the arch install script has ntp enabled from first boot.
[21:32:46] <emmeka> guess I'm not profitable enough

[21:33:31] <MootPoot> fucking TCL again
[21:33:34] <emmeka> MootPoot I can't complain anyway, my ISP is a small local company and they are nice to me. I get 20mbps, and it broadly speaking works.
[21:33:47] <emmeka> the nice thing is I pay for 20mbps and I *get* 20mbps
[21:33:49] <MootPoot> for basic use, 20mbps is alright
[21:33:55] <MootPoot> I guess
[21:34:05] <MootPoot> I pay for 1gbit down and I get 950 or so
[21:34:29] <MootPoot> emmeka: there is a indian multinational that dosen't have their shit together that keeps on hounding me positions 
[21:34:35] <MootPoot> because I applied to them once like 4 years ago
[21:34:56] <MootPoot> like they'll randomly mail me code tests and scedule interviews without even telling me what the job is
[21:35:02] <MootPoot> or what the pay is
[21:35:05] <MootPoot> or where it is
[21:35:20] <MootPoot> and when I ask they dont give me a straight answer
[21:35:50] <emmeka> MootPoot couple people around here have gone Starlink now
[21:36:13] <emmeka> I refuse on principle because it would require me handing over perfectly good money to Elon Musk
[21:36:32] <MootPoot> last time they pulled this shit they told me I had a job in my city that was remote, then somehow that changed to a job in vancouver where I would actually lose money ( even though I'm getting paid ) given the cost of living in vancouver
[21:36:36] <Bco1981> my average internet use the last month is 6,4mbit download. and 1,11mbit upload
[21:36:47] <MootPoot> like, I live for free right now
[21:36:56] <MootPoot> if I make 60k, I live like I make 100k
[21:37:02] <MootPoot> in terms of dispoable income
[21:37:20] <MootPoot> if I moved out I'd have to pay rent and do other disgusting things
[21:37:29] <emmeka> and, existing ISP has earned my loyalty as a customer, they've even done things like once we had an outage that lasted a day, and *without me asking* the ISP emailed me to apologize and said they'd be crediting 2 days off my bill.
[21:38:05] <MootPoot> wonder if you could get a load balancer and get two connections...
[21:38:22] <emmeka> I mean I could upgrade, I am not at their highest plan
[21:38:34] <Bco1981> if there is any other isp in the area.
[21:38:35] <MootPoot> how much do you pay
[21:38:37] <MootPoot> anyways
[21:38:46] <MootPoot> I pay like 80 a month for 1gbit
[21:38:50] <emmeka> $80 CAD/month
[21:38:56] <MootPoot> yikes
[21:39:06] * MootPoot gives his condolences
[21:39:06] <emmeka> but ofc, it's going to be more expensive than fibre. that's pretty obvious
[21:39:14] <emmeka> or cable or whatever
[21:39:22] <MootPoot> is it?
[21:39:36] <emmeka> they're running a service with fewer customers over a larger area with infrastructure that has to operate at high power
[21:39:38] <KatrinValerie> Internet here is so expensive
[21:39:39] <MootPoot> cheaper to maintain cell towers then widespread copper wires
[21:39:44] <emmeka> not really.
[21:40:04] <MootPoot> Bco1981: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fexA7N1rq2o

[21:42:31] <emmeka> MootPoot like if I wanted to I could spend $100/month and get 40mbps, but I have literally never encountered a scenario where what I have wasn't adequate. I would probably think otherwise if say, there were a bunch of kiddos in the house trying to do shit online at the same time I wanted to watch a video or whatever, but this is not the case
[21:43:00] * MootPoot looks at his 4k 60fps JAV downloads
[21:43:02] <MootPoot> uhh
[21:43:32] <emmeka> I mean everything I have is 1080p so
[21:43:50] <emmeka> I'm sure I'd have trouble streaming 4k, but I'm not gonna do that.
[21:44:03] <MootPoot> lucky you dont play games
[21:44:18] <emmeka> I mean I do
[21:44:18] <MootPoot> or at least AAA western ones
[21:44:31] <MootPoot> 200gb install sizes are the norm now
[21:44:41] <MootPoot> when you add all the crap in
[21:44:52] <emmeka> but yeah, nothing competitive online and nothing AAA
[21:45:05] <MootPoot> somehow genshin impact is 35gb
[21:45:08] <MootPoot> a fucking phone game
[21:45:13] <MootPoot> I cant get it either
[21:45:19] <Bco1981> you can't ?
[21:45:29] <MootPoot> I dont mentally got it
[21:45:31] <MootPoot> get it*
[21:45:36] <MootPoot> I have it downloaded but
[21:45:42] <mixfix41> 2g ac wireless gets forty mb/s
[21:45:43] <Bco1981> ah... i have it on pc. but... never played it yet.
[21:45:52] <MootPoot> I cant wrap my head around how that game is the file size that it is
[21:46:19] <Bco1981> big texture files, in bmp format will help
[21:48:19] <lastonestanding> it has much content
[21:48:28] <lastonestanding> and they keep adding more of it
[21:48:35] <emmeka> I mean when you've got people paying a grand to get waifus, the waifus might as well be hi-res
[21:49:33] <MootPoot> the game literally looks like a wii U game
[21:49:36] <MootPoot> in terms of graphics
[21:50:02] <MootPoot> I can understand the file size of black desert ( shit game though ) or MS flight sim, or DCS etc
[21:50:04] <lastonestanding> are you sure it's 35gb and not 3.5?
[21:50:04] <MootPoot> but genshin?
[21:50:13] <MootPoot> lastonestanding: its 35
[21:50:21] <MootPoot> I've been playing it for a few months
[21:50:28] <MootPoot> updates are like 8gb in size
[21:50:55] <Bco1981> i haven't updated it in a long time. and my genshin impact folder says 39gb
[21:51:18] <lastonestanding> maybe do a fresh install then
[21:51:30] <MootPoot> a fresh install is 32-33...

[21:58:17] <lastonestanding> I think I've missed this news
[21:58:23] <lastonestanding> Popular image-sharing site Imgur has been acquired by MediaLab, a Santa Monica-based firm that describes itself as a “holding company of consumer internet brands.”
[21:59:06] <Bco1981> i heard something about that, but didn't feel any difference after moving to brave browser.
[21:59:38] <lastonestanding> their website is vague
[21:59:57] <lastonestanding> so, probably a lil bit shady
