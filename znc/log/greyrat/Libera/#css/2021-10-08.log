[12:05:47] <stevenm__> or perhaps just one specific thing
[12:06:00] <stenno> :not will not (no pun intended) prevent cascading
[12:06:17] <theskillwithin> its like a waterfall, you can only go one direction
[12:06:32] <stevenm__> yeah that's not what I'm getting at
[12:06:35] <stenno> :not(.foo,.bar) should be the way to specify multiple
[12:06:52] <stevenm__> got a div here with class=footer.. then a div inside that (no class on that) and then a span inside that with class=preferences
[12:07:11] <stevenm__> i can't see to say... div.footer :not(span.preferences) { font-side: 0; }
[12:07:21] <stevenm__> or rather I can say it :P but it affects that span anywya
[12:07:29] <stenno> yeah you have to specifically 'reset' that attribute for the span
[12:07:39] <stevenm__> ?
[12:07:55] <theskillwithin> easier to ask for help with a codepen
[12:08:00] <stenno> using :not will not help you here, the way you are doing that now is the right now
[12:08:27] <stevenm__> but it does work if I'm trying to 'not' a div inside a div
[12:08:31] <stevenm__> is it because it's a span?
[12:08:45] <stenno> no
[12:10:06] <stenno> https://jsfiddle.net/ybnkutzf/ stevenm__
[12:10:13] <stenno> :not does not do anything here
[12:10:44] <stevenm__> actually I'm finding that it does
[12:10:50] <stenno> then show your code

[12:12:35] <theskillwithin> if you can type out reduced code in irc, then you can make a reduced example in codepen for sure stevenm__
[12:13:17] <theskillwithin> sometimes just making the codepen you solve it yourself
[12:14:37] <theskillwithin> even if its just attacking one aspect of the problem at a time, its still better than not having one
[12:15:25] <theskillwithin> esp with css, where the structure of the html is a huge factor
[12:17:03] <stevenm__> https://jsfiddle.net/per745Lk/
[12:17:41] <stevenm__> but if you swap the CSS to...  div.footer :not(.preferences) { font-size: 0; }
[12:17:54] <stevenm__> then everything is hidden - and I'd expect it should just be the bits that aren't the span which are
[12:19:09] <stenno> yes, because .preferences is not a direct descendant of .footer
[12:19:31] <stevenm__> right but I already tried 'div span.preferences' too - no joy
[12:20:18] <stenno> :not does not work when you are cascading
[12:21:08] <stenno> in your fiddle, you apply the rule 'a child of .footer which is not .right'
[12:21:38] <stevenm__> ok so without altering the html - how can I go about hiding everything but the span?
[12:21:44] <stevenm__> i.e. within .footer
[12:22:33] <stenno> you would just reset the font-size for .preferences explicitely
[12:22:52] <stevenm__> tried that also - didn't work
[12:23:19] <stenno> then you did it wrong
[12:23:21] <stenno> https://jsfiddle.net/vhm584ex/
[12:25:07] <stevenm__> https://jsfiddle.net/per745Lk/1/

[15:36:29] <stevenm__> it wouldn't be able to reach it
[15:36:36] <hassoon> what is this ?
[15:36:43] <stevenm__> you see how I've already had these thought processes? :P
[15:36:44] <hassoon> you coding inside a prison ?
[15:36:59] *** Joins: pycode (~pycode@2001:b07:5d28:551:d65c:6a73:66f4:ab7f)
[15:37:17] <stevenm__> work does often feel like that
[15:37:29] <hassoon> your boss has lost it
[15:37:35] <stevenm__> amen
[15:38:20] <hassoon> so i think that you need to create some kind of portable webpage, where everything is just portable and does not rely on any kind of storage medium ?
[15:40:01] <stevenm__> well it's nice to hear that you're thinking... about... well anything really... it's good to think
[15:40:07] <stevenm__> but my thinking has already resulted in thought :)
[15:40:18] <stevenm__> I was really seeking any input on the task at hand
[15:40:46] <stevenm__> i already know what that task is and how crazy it is :)
[15:41:45] <hassoon> stevenm__: why isn't a style tag enough for you ? that's portable imo
[15:42:01] <hassoon> stevenm__: you just write it in the browser, and it renders css for you
[15:42:16] <hassoon> 07:10 < stevenm__> well it's nice to hear that you're thinking... about... well anything really... it's good to think
[15:42:28] <hassoon> and what is that supposed to mean ?
[15:44:56] <stevenm__> again the only thing where I can add anything to is this config option
[15:45:06] <stevenm__> so I can't just add in random style tags wherever I want to
[15:45:39] <stevenm__> there are NO files :)
[15:46:01] <hassoon> what is the config option
[15:46:07] <hassoon> what is it exactly ?
[15:46:29] <stevenm__> i've already said the option twice now
[15:46:46] <stevenm__> not that it would mean much to you, just as much would the project mean much to you
[15:46:53] <stevenm__> so there is little point in asking about it
[15:47:09] <hassoon> you know what ?
[15:47:49] <hassoon> you have a good day, you see mto be a very annoying person, and helping you is just a wrong idea at whole
[15:54:28] <stevenm__> fun!
[15:54:41] <stevenm__> Q: <stevenm__> can anyone think of a reason why
[15:54:45] <stevenm__> A: <stevenm__> oooh 2000 characters max
[15:54:56] <stevenm__> see that was me answering my own question... you likely missed it
