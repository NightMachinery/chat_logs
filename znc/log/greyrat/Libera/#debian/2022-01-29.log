[00:01:42] <sney> it was a reply to peetaur's question
[00:02:05] <somiaj> oh I see, they were trying to break their install.
[00:02:19] <peetaur> dpkg -i will install it, not complain about deps missing?
[00:02:19] <dpkg> package will install it, not complain about deps missing is already installed
[00:02:50] <somiaj> peetaur: It will put it into the upacked but not configured state which puts your system in a state it is broken and apt -f install will often fix it
[00:03:07] <peetaur> ah good...that sounds like what I want; so let's test and find out..
[00:03:19] <somiaj> you could also forcefully remove a dependency (no vital), dpkg will let you force things
[00:03:59] <somiaj> actually maybe not unpacked and not configured, it might be in another state, but dpkg doesn't just bail, it still installs it in a broken state is the point

[02:45:15] <wade__> yeah i followed that guide yesterday, dracorex
[02:45:17] <dracorex> only thing i can *see* in your fstab, is it appears you have used 'spaces' instead of 'tabs' - between items
[02:45:35] <wade__> and it resulted in the md0 disappearing after reboot

[02:46:22] <wade__> is why i looked at the debian manpages
[02:46:36] <wade__> but their instructions end after making sure the array is made to spec
[02:46:38] <sney> fstab doesn't care whether you use tabs or spaces. tabs are nicer for readability and consistent columns, but it'll get parsed fine either way
[02:47:00] <dracorex> thats nice to know, sney - i've always tab'd it and it's always worked.
[02:47:22] <wade__> did you take a gander at my fstab and mdadm.conf? if so do you reckon this md0 will persist through reboots?
[02:47:30] <dracorex> only thing i could think of seeing his fstab
[02:48:13] <wade__> i've got the system on a major UPS right now to preclude reboots until this is answered so am not in a gigantic hurry
[02:48:20] <somiaj> wade__: can you manually mount this raid array after boot?

[02:50:26] <somiaj> wade__: okay, so don't worry about fstab until you can get it to mount, if you try 'mount /dev/md0 /mnt' as root, what happens?
[02:51:07] <somiaj> the idea here is get it working first, once you know how to manually mount it, you will then know what to add to fstab
[02:51:10] <wade__> mount: /mnt: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/md0, missing codepage or helper program, or other error.
[02:51:43] <somiaj> wade__: are you booted into your system or on some live system? Anyways that makes it sound like the array is either not up or configured fiferently

[02:52:00] <wade__> with kde plasma

[02:53:04] <somiaj> do you recall what command/part of the guide mounted it, and have you tried to manually do that part again to see if it still works?
[02:53:26] <wade__> no but i can find out shortly one moment please
[02:54:11] <somiaj> I don't know md config well enough, but maybe you have an issue with that. Anyways I gotta go, but my advice is ignore fstab for now, get it to the point you can manually mount it (and unmount it) relabily, once you have that down, we can help make your fstab have the right options.
[02:54:22] <somiaj> Others here might also be able to better help  you track down your mdconfiguration

[02:54:50] <wade__> sudo mount /dev/md0 /mnt/md0
[02:55:08] <somiaj> note the first command will destory all info on the md0 device (it will create a new filesystem) so don't do that if you have data there
[02:55:15] <wade__> there is no data
[02:55:36] <somiaj> and if you run all three of those commands again it mounts?

[02:56:11] <wade__> very good german shepherds, about as cuddly as dogs that aren't labs or golden retrievers can be
[02:56:13] <somiaj> since there is no data, not gonna worry about that, though you should really only need to do the third, if the third isn't working now but worked earlier, this means your raid configuration isn't working

[03:05:54] <PerfDave> Your mdadm.conf seems to have three definitions for the same UUID, which looks weird to me.
[03:05:57] <wade__> that file was generated by the debian installer

[03:08:54] <wade__> since it takes 17 hours to resync i'm really hoping to avoid a reboot until a consensus of more than one user is reached, nothing personal intended
[03:09:16] <wade__> i really don't want to do that a 3rd time this week
[03:09:45] <SymbioticFemale> so if i want to release a project into a debian main repository, it can have telemetry and send private data back to me for analysis/sale, right? so long as i license the software under a compatible FOSS license?
[03:10:50] <sney> I think you'd want to discuss that in #debian-mentors on OFTC (note, right now you are on libera) or on the debian-legal mailing list
[03:11:16] <SymbioticFemale> ok i'll hit them up on oftc
[03:11:18] <sney> I'm not aware of any specific prohibition but I don't think it's likely to be super welcome either
[03:11:19] <PerfDave> wade__: That's entirely fair enough :) But assuming that's correct, your next step is to do something with that /dev/md0 - either put a filesystem directly on it, or probably better to use it as an LVM volume.
[03:11:46] <wade__> idk anything about lvm ;)
[03:11:55] <wade__> anyway mdadm.conf now looks like https://controlc.com/1000374b
[03:12:00] <wade__> does it need further trimming?
[03:12:17] <PerfDave> wade__: It's pretty easy, and just means you can deal with "virtual" partitions and not be bound by partitions having to take up contiguous disk blocks.
[03:12:39] <wade__> such has never bothered me before?
[03:13:21] <wade__> i barely know how to make it ext4 much less anything else
[03:13:24] <PerfDave> wade__: Fair enough. It's pretty easy and can save a lot of pain in future IME. Might be worth looking into if you're getting back into things :)
[03:13:46] <wade__> i did see lvm in the debian installer though and thought hrm that wasn't there the last time i diddled with mdadm
[03:14:07] <PerfDave> wade__: On the mdadm.conf, I'd comment out that last ARRAY line, just leave the /dev/md/0 one
[03:14:35] <Khepra> SymbioticFemale: "send private data back"? lol? you'll have that kicked out of the repo, if it ever lands there, before you could say "I violate GPL!"
[03:14:49] <wade__> by comment out do you mean put a # or delete it?
[03:15:00] <SymbioticFemale> Khepra: i don't think that violates the GPL
[03:15:02] <PerfDave> wade__: Stick a # in front of it, just in case - much easier to restore that way.
[03:15:22] <Khepra> SymbioticFemale: no, not this. your earlier desire at a license that prohibits stores, did :)
[03:15:43] <Khepra> I'm just seeing a pattern of very anti-foss, anti-freedom going on here.
[03:15:43] <SymbioticFemale> hmm
[03:15:56] <wade__> such like https://controlc.com/0fc659e1 ?
[03:16:20] <PerfDave> Such a piece of software under a DSFG-free license would be trivial to fork to remove the spyware, and I expect Debian would be more than happy to carry such a fork.
[03:16:35] <PerfDave> wade__: That looks great to me
[03:16:38] <wade__> :D
[03:16:41] <Khepra> yeah. like debian already compiles that crap out of Audacity
[03:16:58] <SymbioticFemale> Khepra: no, i'm fine with releasing my own code under the GPL or Perl license but this discussion is irrelevant to that. i came here to ask the question because the topic of audacity and firefox came up in #linux just now.

LVM just means I can just create, remove, expand and shrink partitions within that 3.7G without worrying too much. Also supports stuff like filesystem snapshots which can be useful.

[04:26:55] <ghola> hello, I'm having some trouble getting PCF/BDF bitmap font files to work on my Debian 11 laptop. I've tried enabling bitmap fonts with 'sudo dpkg-reconfigure fontconfig-config', refreshing my fonts with 'sudo dpkg-reconfigure fontconfig' and 'fc-cache -fv'. I've also tried running 'xset fp+ <my local font path>' and 'xset fp rehash', plus a few reboots. Nothing will make xfontsel or fontmanager see the fonts
[04:27:31] *** Joins: wade__ (~wade@user/wade)
[04:29:08] <ghola> i also tried creating files in /etc/fonts/conf.avail/ and linking them to /etc/fonts/conf.d/ to specifically enable/allow these fonts, as described in the comment by "ximpr" on this thread: https://github.com/polybar/polybar/issues/1466
[04:29:30] <ghola> no success - xfontsel and fontmanager cannot see the fonts
[04:29:39] <ghola> is there anything I could be missing?
[04:31:16] <somiaj> ghola: by bitmap fonts do you mean the old style x11 fonts? If so fontconfig won't have anything to do with those. Xft fonts and bitmap fonts are handled by different libaries.
[04:31:17] *** Quits: wade__ (~wade@user/wade) (Remote host closed the connection)
[04:31:57] <ghola> somiaj: yeah I believe they are the old style fonts -- PCF and BDF format. Which libraries/tools manage those fonts?
[04:32:59] <somiaj> It has been a while, but I wonder if the old tool xfontsel can be pointed at your font files directly to double check they work. If so you just need to pop then into the proper location

[04:34:03] <somiaj> https://www.x.org/archive/X11R7.5/doc/fonts/fonts.html -- scroll down to 'installing bitmap fonts', maybe that has enough info
[04:34:31] <ghola> somiaj: i will play around with xfontsel and check out that link - thank you!

[04:37:30] <wade__> i found some things but i'm not sure if they're applicable to deb 11.2
[04:37:31] <somiaj> wade__: I don't think you want to do that
[04:37:51] <ghola> i do have it installed, but it doesn't look like I can select specific font files with xfontsel - I'm reading through the documentation at the link you sent me now to see if I'm missing anything

[04:38:05] <somiaj> In general users (even your main user) shouldn't have permissions to read/write to the array directly, this should all be done via the filesystem level once it is mounted by root.
[04:38:16] <wade__> somiaj what do you suggest instead? i own my home and nobody else has access to the room it's in...
[04:38:22] <wade__> ah
[04:38:51] <wade__> there is nothing sensitive that i want to put on the computer
[04:38:55] <somiaj> once you mount any filesystem from that array, such has /home/, just use chmod/chown appropertly on the file (thus the filesystem) so users can read/write files there
[04:39:02] <wade__> there are no files
[04:39:06] <wade__> it's a fresh array
[04:39:11] <somiaj> still users shouldn't have access to the raw device, they should have access to the filesystem
[04:39:17] <wade__> i can't write anything to it
[04:39:22] <somiaj> and this is done by setting permissions to that file system
[04:39:23] <wade__> eg no files
[04:39:28] <somiaj> wade__: is it mounted at /home now?
[04:40:00] <wade__> it shows up in dolphin but it's /dev/md0 not /home/md0 how much of a difference does this make?
[04:40:29] <somiaj> here /dev/md0 is a device, not a mounted file system, the first thing you have to do is mount that file system. Where have you mounted /dev/md0?
[04:40:37] <wade__> oh boy
[04:40:44] <wade__> pretty sure usr mnt
[04:40:57] <somiaj> so it is mounted at /mnt/md0?
[04:41:10] <somiaj> run command 'mount' to see where it is mounted
[04:43:23] <wade__> https://paste.debian.net/1228786/

[04:48:20] <somiaj> wade__: so the device is at /mnt/md0, so just modify the files inside the filesystem so users can read/write to them like you would any unix style file system.
[04:48:47] <wade__> somiaj, there are no files
[04:48:53] <somiaj> wade__: if you just want full access to everything by default, chmod 775 /mnt/md0, create a group chown root.customgroup /mnt/md0, and add the users you want to access that to the group
[04:48:55] <wade__> i can't write any files to it
[04:49:03] <somiaj> that is fine, it is a blank file system, just change the permisions so you can write to it
[04:49:12] <wade__> it's a brand spanking new ext4 partiation on a spanking new array
[04:49:14] <somiaj> or create subdirs, and allow users to write to specific subdirs, here depends on what you want
[04:49:32] <wade__> ah
[04:49:58] <somiaj> again it is the filesystem (not the array) you want to modify to your needs

[08:54:06] <labrador>  I had run a command yesterday >sudo cat /dev/watchdog

[08:54:27] <labrador> Now its kindof working fine(atleast boots fine)

[08:54:54] <dvs> !enter
[08:54:55] <dpkg> The enter key is not a substitute for punctuation.  Hitting enter unnecessarily makes it difficult to follow what you are saying.  Consider using ',', '. ', ';', '...', '---', or ':' instead.  If you hit enter too often, you will be autokicked for flooding the channel.

[08:56:22] <sussudio> are you running this as root or what
[08:57:02] <labrador> I ran it yesterday when I was trying to fix an error sussudio. Doing that just tripped the watchdog
[08:57:10] <labrador> And caused a reset
[08:57:47] <sussudio> you keep doing the enter thing.
[08:58:08] <labrador> I tried punctuation that time. I'll do more of it sorry
[09:00:11] <labrador> But is there a way to know what causes this sussudio?
[09:03:23] <sussudio> labrador: yes, googling gives the solution. it's some package named "telepathy" causing it.

[09:07:34] <labrador> sussudio, which telepathy are you talking about? I don't have kde-telepathy installed.
[09:08:10] <labrador> I think the reason it happened is because of that unclean reboot. A lot of inodes were deleted in that fsck too.

[09:11:06] <sussudio> don't paste it here. all those things are using up time and slowing down your system. see if there's anything in there you don't need, like "modemmanager" is you're not using a modem on that machine.
[09:11:58] <sussudio> not sure why polkit is #2 of things to use cpu in the list on that google result... what on earth could it be doing.
[09:17:58] <labrador> No sussudio everything in systemd-analyze looks normal. Time is >Startup finished in 6.045s (firmware) + 7.788s (loader) + 7.500s (kernel) + 43.383s (userspace) = 1min 4.717s. Which is absolutely normal for my PC.
[09:19:42] <labrador> I guess I'll just have to see for sometime what got borked...
[09:19:43] <sussudio> labrador: it's something you upgraded or installed since your last reboot, according to several google results.
[09:19:56] <sussudio> possibly this "snap" service.

[09:21:15] <labrador> sussudio, the error can say that. But the special condition of running that command also has to be taken into consideration. Nothing was installed or removed. I do not use snap. The only thing that happened was the command. And I checked them once but I'll check the logs again too.

[13:23:59] <tercaL> Hi there. How to have PHP 8 and latest version of Nginx installed via apt?
[13:24:10] <tercaL> The system's official repo has PHP 7.4.
[13:24:36] <Wulf> tercaL: Hello. Install newer debian.
[13:24:42] <tercaL> I got latest.
[13:24:53] <tercaL> 11.2.0-amd64
[13:25:16] <Wulf> tercaL: oh, never mind. I thought it already shipped php8.
[13:25:29] <tercaL> Weird but it hasn't.
[13:26:58] <tercaL> While PHP 8.0.x is "old stable", even PHP 8.1 is up as "current stable". Officially-sticking to 7.4 is not really good. PHP 8 is quite fast.
[13:27:48] <Wulf> tercaL: well, it's debian. PHP 8 was released on 26 Nov 2020, Debian 11 had its freeze on 12 Feb 2021.
[13:27:51] <tercaL> I'm new to Debian, would there be an update so that PHP 7.4 could be replaced with version 8, or the versions don't change until the next release?
[13:28:13] <Wulf> tercaL: Looks like there wasn't enough time to get a "bleeding edge" php version into debian stable
[13:28:37] <Wulf> tercaL: they probably won't change. You can use a third party repo such as ... hang on a sec.

[14:05:15] <dpkg> PHP Packages with different versions than stable are available from deb.sury.org, provided by the same developer who maintains PHP for debian stable. Not supported in #debian, but should be about as reliable as <backports>. Short instructions can be found at https://packages.sury.org/php/README.txt . See <mod-php>.
[14:05:26] <tercaL> Who manages "sury"? Is it *official*?
[14:05:42] <tercaL> I hesitate to add 3rd party repos to production servers.
[14:05:48] <Wulf> tercaL: same person who maintains the official packages

[19:53:18] <Khepra> you did that only if you had multiple filesystems
[19:53:22] <LikWidChz> eitherway putting data on it seemed like playing with fire.
[19:53:31] <Khepra> that it definitely is
[19:54:03] <Khepra> btrfs is only barely usable in a mirror profile with at least 2 drives to safeguard against its fragility to transient errors
[19:54:21] <Khepra> raid5 profile is definitely, still, warned against by developers themselves.
[19:55:03] <Khepra> but like with any filesystem... ANY.... filesystem... you should have independent backups. depending on how much you value the data, preferrably in 3-2-1 backup pattern.
[19:55:12] <LikWidChz> also its kind of like the amount of extra random disks I have is pretty low. I have two identical nas's I built. a while ago, they are celeron based single core, mini atx has 6 sata ports, 1st port is an 80 gig ssd, the other 5 are for random disks. running the debian net install without a gui super super SUPER basic which I like.
[19:56:46] <LikWidChz> its not quite there yet for me to want to pull the trigger on SSD based nas's but its getting closer.
[19:56:47] <Khepra> LikWidChz: if you can pair up disks in groups of two similarly sized disks, I would really recommend striping mirror vdevs under ZFS
[19:57:33] <Khepra> The only otehr solution offering JBOD bunching under a single pool is LVM, but that's lacking a lot of things you definitely DO want when dealing with such different media: redundancy and data checksumming
[19:58:29] <LikWidChz> well right now I have 3 nas's, one Qnap that has 14tb and my smaller custom wood nas I built two of, has one of them populated with 2tb disks 5x of them in raid 0, so because I have a spare nas "sounds funny" I thought about trying to take some of the other disks i have sitting in a drawer and trying to experiment with file systems.
[19:58:52] <LikWidChz> sorry that should have been 5x 2tb disks in raid5
[19:59:10] <Khepra> another option is grouping disks into two (or more) RAID0 mdadm devices, and then using them in ZFS mirror vdevs.
[19:59:38] <Khepra> but such combinations are.... rather experimental and flaky. however, if I'd trust anything atop of that, it'd be ZFS.

[20:02:55] <LikWidChz> I would do it just to see the lights blink.

[20:08:39] <LikWidChz> I guess is there a reason why a user would want ZFS over RAID-5 when they have 5x 2tb disks? or what? I had also read that with ZFS you really need some decent hardware running it behind the scenes.. my celeron single core is pretty weak for real work, but with the setup I have I typically get ~85 / 100mb a second read from it granted its on gigabit. and is fast enough
[20:09:51] <Khepra> ZFS has RAID profiles. in this case, raidz1 is closest to RAID5
[20:11:13] <Khepra> ZFS has no greater resource requirements than BTRFS, which is a comparable filesystem. mdadm and lvm aren't fully comparable beacuse they lack same functionality. ZFS loves RAM, but doesn't strictly require it. the more RAM you give it, the better it'll perform. But it can operate in as low as 64MB which is the absolute minimum iirc
[20:12:00] <Khepra> (64MB given to it, which would then require a bit more overall RAM, for the rest of the OS to work)

[20:21:43] <Khepra> FightingFalcon: you can't limit RAM, as it takes whatever it takes. But you can run the process in a single thread and give it very low cpu priority. eitehr with nice, or using cgroup and cpu shares if you really need to go that far
[20:22:11] <Khepra> I have somethign similar, but it's a continuous process, munchin on millions of gis data imagery. and nice works more than enough.
[20:23:43] <Khepra> and as I use ZFS I can limit the pagecache (ARC, actually) trashing, so it's not affected by transient one-time loads of an image.

[21:12:13] <somiaj> wade__: It is probably not the best idea to use the sudo group like that. Instead create a new group and add users to it. You may also want to look up the GID and sticky bit, if you want users to have access to each other files without modifing the permissions each time.

[22:52:42] <amacater_> Sorry - if you plug the laptop into a dock - that's presumably charging it - it's fine?
[22:52:59] <rdr> are you using a desktop environment Benzi-Junior ?
[22:53:58] <Benzi-Junior> rdr, nope

[22:55:46] <Benzi-Junior> rdr, yes pulse is installed
[22:56:03] <rdr> you might find info if you run pavucontrol (i *think* that's the name)

[22:56:27] *** Joins: Fauto_ (~dante@gateway/tor-sasl/filohuhum)
[22:56:34] <Benzi-Junior> it just showed a "dummy output"
[22:57:05] <rdr> ohh that happens for me sometimes
[22:57:08] <Benzi-Junior> untill I plugged the dock in then it could detect that as aaudio device
[22:57:27] <rdr> it could be that you don't have the non-free firmware for your audio setup perhaps?
[22:57:35] <rdr> I also sometimes was getting that until i rebooted
[22:57:50] *** Quits: han-solo (~han-solo@user/han-solo) (Quit: leaving)
[22:57:54] <Benzi-Junior> amacater_, the dock is  a usb-c dock that provides a couple of HDMI ports as well as two jacks so it works as a audio device
[22:58:19] <Benzi-Junior> rdr, that could be, the only non-free firmware  I have is iwlifi
[22:58:40] <Benzi-Junior> rdr, how would I found out what would be the appropriate package to install ?

[22:59:47] <rdr> i think this would be a good start for the latter: https://packages.debian.org/buster/firmware-linux-nonfree
[22:59:53] <amacater_> Possibly firmware-intel-audio or similar from Debian non-free archive. Check through dmesg for what's reported on bootup
[23:00:14] *** Joins: digilink (~digilink@user/digilink)
[23:01:00] <amacater_> rdr: I generally install the two meta packages firmware-linux-nonfree and firmware-misc-nonfree. There are issues with some of the newest laptops where there's a need for non-free firmware to get anything out of the video at all, for example.
