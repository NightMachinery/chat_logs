[01:00:54] <manicennui> How iMessage a lock in strategy? When I switched from iOS to Android I went to some page to remove my number from iMessage and that was it.
[01:00:59] <manicennui> How is

[01:01:51] <gerikson> didn't you see how it promotes segregation into Blue Bubbles and Green Bubbles?!
[01:02:07] <gerikson> ofc the Byzantines did it first ...
[01:02:51] <gerikson> also it's a Pixies song apparently!
[01:03:01] <manicennui> Everyone I know uses SMS. I'm sure a few of them use other random services, but not enough for us all to switch from SMS.
[01:03:13] <manicennui> Facebook is probably the second most popular after SMS.
[01:05:27] <gerikson> SMS is the fallback
[01:05:47] <gerikson> I tend to text my wife (she's on Samsung) but we use MEssenger too
[01:06:03] <gerikson> my stepson doens't have Messenger (I guess he has Whatsapp?) so we text
[01:06:14] <gerikson> same with my stepdaughter, and parents...
[01:06:40] <gerikson> manicennui: read that thread and there's plenty of anecdata about how no-one in Europe texts ;)
[01:06:53] <manicennui> gerikson: Possibly.
[01:07:31] <gerikson> I have Whatsapp installed but I suspect I'm too old for it to be relevant for me... it seems to be used a lot for parents of kids coordintaint here
[01:07:40] <gerikson> Telegram? dunno anyone who uses it
[01:07:46] <manicennui> The only people who I see talking about those apps in the US are paranoid geeks.
[01:07:48] <gerikson> nor Signal, becuase I'm a normie ;)
[01:07:53] <gerikson> lol
[01:11:52] <martian67> I wish apple would just open up imessage
[01:11:59] <martian67> its really dumb they don't
[01:17:24] <companion_cube> manicennui: it's just another example of a Mac only app and protocol
[01:17:44] <companion_cube> I'd say it's lockin but not more than a lot of other Mac things
[01:23:00] <manicennui> It isn't limited to sending messages to other iMessage users though.
[01:23:49] <manicennui> It is literally SMS when one of the parties does not use iMessage.
[01:32:51] <ngoldbaum> martian67: the distinction between ‚Äúblue‚Äù and ‚Äúgreen‚Äù contacts in messages is a pretty strong differentiator and social reinforcement for apple
[01:33:20] <cb> i have an iphone and i dont really give a shit
[01:33:43] <ngoldbaum> also how only one person not being on an iphone kicks a group chat onto sms where one message in a thousand or so takes 24 hours to deliver for dumb reasons
[01:33:47] <cb> whatsapp is used ime only by people outside of north america or east asia
[01:33:55] <cb> europeans, latin americans, africans, etc. all use whatsapp
[01:45:55] <edk> what do north americans use?
[01:46:15] <manicennui> SMS
[01:52:57] <ngoldbaum> sms, facebook chat, google chat, snapchat
[01:53:04] <ngoldbaum> but mostly sms
[02:10:13] <Church> Yeah mostly SMS but I think I do use WhatsApp line my other two methods of keeping in contact with people that said that constantly you're not sites
[02:10:48] <Church> Text to speech is a punk ass
[02:15:41] <gwozniak> I only use iMessage.  This is because I barely talk text with anyone.  I had WhatsApp a while ago and Signal, but no one ever used them so I got rid of them
[02:20:13] <gwozniak> I asked my wife (a high school teacher) what her students use, but she said she's a bad person to ask because she's only ever telling the kids to put their phones away, not asking them what they are using ;)
[02:20:51] <gwozniak> Although she thinks many of them use WhatsApp to talk to their families overseas
[02:24:16] <quanticle> manicennui: Counterpoint: my brother just bought an iPhone recently
[02:24:29] <quanticle> Despite him being a devoted Android user for the past decade
[02:24:32] <quanticle> Why?
[02:24:38] <manicennui> Counterpoint to what?
[02:24:39] <quanticle> All of his college friends use iMessage
[02:25:01] <quanticle> And he was missing messages and group conversations by not having iMessage
[02:25:11] <quanticle> iMessage absolutely is a lock-in strategy
[02:25:13] <manicennui> Sounds like shitty friends.
[02:25:31] <manicennui> There is nothing preventing one from sending messages using SMS.
[02:25:37] <quanticle> Yeah, well, it's med school, and that's not the sort of thing you want to go through alone
[02:25:40] <manicennui> They'd have to actively exclude him.
[02:25:50] <quanticle> manicennui: Group texts
[02:26:04] <manicennui> You can send group texts with SMS.
[02:26:22] <quanticle> Well, I dunno, I'm not an iOS user
[02:26:41] <quanticle> But my brother isn't the only one who's switched and cited iMessage group texts as their reason for switching
[02:26:50] <quanticle> I have multiple anecdotes
[02:27:17] <manicennui> I've never even seen iMessage do anything that would deter me from sending a message to a non-iMessage user.
[02:27:35] <manicennui> It's not like, "this fucking loser doesn't have iMessage, do you want to remove them from this message?"
[02:28:00] <quanticle> Have you been able to include SMS users and iMessage users in a mixed SMS/iMessage group?
[02:29:01] <quanticle> Also, personally, I've found that when people with iMessage try to share videos with me, it doesn't work
[02:29:12] <quanticle> I just get a thumbnail of the video
[02:29:18] <manicennui> I don't know that I've paid attention.
[02:29:19] <quanticle> But no link or any other way to actually play the video
[02:29:30] <quanticle> Haha, maybe you're the shitty friend ;)
[02:29:34] <manicennui> I don't actually text often. I mostly get updates about orders and access codes.
[02:29:40] <manicennui> I email my friends.
[02:29:40] <quanticle> Same
[02:30:14] <quanticle> gerikson: Maybe you're just not third world enough to use Whatsapp. I'm from an immigrant background and my parents are *constantly* on WhatsApp
[02:30:25] <quanticle> Free video calls to the third world is a hell of a hook
[02:30:43] <manicennui> The US is very third world, hence our use of SMS.
[02:30:53] * quanticle rolls eyes
[02:31:06] <Brekkjern> What's wrong with SMS?
[02:31:11] <manicennui> We are behind basically every developed country when it comes to stuff like this.
[02:31:13] <quanticle> Yes, look at all our 24-hour electricity and drinkable tap water! So third world!
[02:31:46] <manicennui> quanticle: Perhaps you hadn't heard that a significant portion of our water supply has dangerous levels of lead.
[02:31:49] <manicennui> Not just Detroit.
[02:32:00] <manicennui> And we still have a lot of people without indoor plumbing.
[02:32:16] <manicennui> But I was referring specifically to anything around cell phones and connectivity.
[02:32:26] <quanticle> A lot meaning thousands or millions? Like, seriously, if you're trying to compare the US to India, you've never been to India
[02:32:47] <manicennui> https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/its-almost-2020-and-2-million-americans-still-dont-have-running-water-new-report-says/2019/12/10/a0720e8a-14b3-11ea-a659-7d69641c6ff7_story.html
[02:33:11] <manicennui> I'm not comparing the US to India. I'm comparing it to developed countries.
[02:33:36] <manicennui> The US is great for those of us who have money.
[02:33:53] <gwozniak> quanticle: I think I've run into that media sharing thing from/to SMS and iMessage before
[02:34:06] <manicennui> Other than being overcharged for healthcare, Internet connectivity, and mobile service.
[02:34:06] *** Joins: jaix (~jaix@user/jaix)
[02:35:16] <quanticle> Yeah, okay, whatever.
[02:35:35] <quanticle> Anyway, the original topic was, "Is iMessage a form of lock-in"
[02:35:38] <quanticle> And I think it is
[02:35:49] <quanticle> Because of the group messaging and media sharing limitations described above
[02:36:08] <quanticle> It's like Facebook having a soft restriction on sharing links outside of Facebook
[02:36:28] <quanticle> Is it lock in? On the one hand, no, because a sufficiently motivated user can find a way around it
[02:36:37] <manicennui> They make links to FB pretty useless if you aren't logged in.
[02:36:44] <quanticle> But on the other hand, yes, because the vast vast majority of users are *not* sufficiently motivated
[02:36:50] <gwozniak> Can the other messaging apps interact with SMS as well as their own protocols?  I honestly don't know.

[03:02:37] <ngoldbaum> you can have sms group chats with imessage users but it kind of sucks

[03:03:44] <quanticle> He has an iPhone SE now
[03:03:58] <quanticle> As far as Apple is concerned: Mission Accomplished
[03:04:08] <companion_cube> manicennui: group SMS sucks
[03:05:08] <quanticle> This goes back to what I was saying: the fact that something is possible doesn't imply there's no lock in. Things don't just have to be possible, they have to be easy. Easy enough that a harried non-technical med school student can do it.
[03:06:07] <companion_cube> the worst really is the bait-and-switch lockin
[03:06:14] <companion_cube> like slack: "we're compatible with IRC, no worries!"
[03:06:23] <companion_cube> and then: "oh no, no more IRC bridge ü§∑"

[03:11:25] <quanticle> IRC does suck
[03:11:28] <quanticle> But discord is not better
[03:11:39] <Brekkjern> Discord is different
[03:11:45] <gerikson> "better than IRC" is a low bar ;)
[03:12:21] <quanticle> I do wonder
[03:12:23] <Brekkjern> Unless you got a way to do screen sharing and VOIP over XDCC, then Discord provides a different set of abilities
[03:12:26] <quanticle> Because if it's such a low bar
[03:12:32] <quanticle> Why do so many services fail to meet it?
[03:12:56] <Brekkjern> Casue they don't try to make IRC Version 4, but rather something else
[03:13:14] <Brekkjern> And you try to use it as IRC v4, and then having a shit experience
[03:15:09] <quanticle> I would have a less shit experience if these services didn't advertise themselves as a superset of IRC. Honestly, given my current setup, forget IRCv4; I'm not even sure I need IRCv3 :)
[03:16:38] <gerikson> re: iMessage as an Apple lock-in, I think it's a necessary but not sufficient cause for someone to switch. It's not a killer app, it's part of a killer ecosystem
[03:17:21] <gerikson> switch to iPhone and you get iMessage *and* arguably the best most up to date apps anywhere
[03:17:36] <gerikson> and it's not as if a lightyl used iphone is expensie
[03:19:05] <quanticle> Or an iPhone SE, in this case. They're only $349, new.
[03:19:43] <gerikson> yeah
[03:20:02] <quanticle> And yeah, they don't necessarily have the *latest* CPU or the most RAM or the fancy OLED displays, but they're still adequate, and, more importantly from Apple's perspective, *hella profitable*

[04:07:10] <companion_cube> multiline messages might also be nice
[04:07:18] <companion_cube> even if only to interop better with matrix
[04:08:18] <quanticle> Yeah, but as an IRC user, I haven't been bothered by the lack of multi-line messages in forever. Yeah, on some abstract level, it sucks that clients have to implement multiline on their end, but in practice, every major IRC client *does* implement multi-line messages
[04:08:44] <companion_cube> not really, they can be interleaved with other messages, be subject to throttling, etc.
[04:08:55] <companion_cube> you can paste multiple lines but they're just multiple messages
[04:11:47] <quanticle> Yeah, like I said above, though: in practice? Not really that much of a problem
[04:13:33] <companion_cube> maybe
[04:13:53] <companion_cube> I odn't feel a strong need for it, but when it lands it might be one of these "oh it's nice actually"

[04:35:28] <quanticle> They have to sell the latest year's TurboTax, after all
[04:35:28] <manicennui> Well, not for those reasons.
[04:35:35] <quanticle> And how can they do that if there are no changes to the tax code?
[04:36:04] <manicennui> It's not as if the tax code becomes simpler if it doesn't change.
[04:36:38] <companion_cube> you do need to pay taxes every year, they don't really need the code to change
[04:36:44] <companion_cube> although it might slow down potential competitors
[04:36:44] <manicennui> Even if the tax code doesn't change for a decade, most of us are still not going to become experts on it.

[04:37:42] <quanticle> companion_cube: My point was, if there are no changes to the tax code, there's no incentive to buy Turbotax 20XX rather than just reusing Turbotax 20XX-1

[04:47:36] <companion_cube> joke's on you, I moved to the US to still work in OCaml

[05:12:44] <quanticle> And if you disagree with how much you owe, you can of course file a return to contest

[06:43:47] <manicennui> jeffvandermeer is the author of the series that Annihilation was adapted from.
[06:44:02] <manicennui> I wonder whether he just strongly prefers horror.
[07:12:03] <gwozniak> I love Fincher and Alien 3 is only enjoyable if you do like Fincher.  No way it's better than Aliens.
[07:12:34] <gwozniak> By the way, I'm a big fan of Fincher and will gladly watch Alien 3, but it is not a great movie.

[07:13:18] <gwozniak> Alien Resurrection is maybe marginally better, but it's not great either
[07:14:24] <gwozniak> Starship Troopers came out the same year as Alien Resurrection and it's a much better movie
[07:14:43] <gwozniak> It's the one I remember more, that's for sure
[07:15:33] <manicennui> Not having Ripley as the lead kind of ruined it for me.
[07:15:45] <manicennui> Resurrection that is.
[07:15:50] <manicennui> I don't even know how to describe her role.
[07:15:52] <manicennui> Fan service?
[07:17:07] <gwozniak> What saved it from being really bad was that it wasn't too serious
[07:17:33] <gwozniak> And Brad Dourif as the obsessed scientist
[07:17:44] <manicennui> I honestly can't remember another character in that movie other than the guy who looked like Bishop at the end and the Quantum Leap guy.

[19:08:11] <cb> i use what sounds like a good fit from the standard library and don't worry about it
[19:08:30] <cb> i basically use C but with STL so i dont need to write a fucking hashmap

[19:09:06] <gwozniak> GCC/binutils is all custom versions of them

[19:10:46] <cb> write a compiler? i sleep

[19:11:35] <companion_cube> cb: good, there's a need for complementary people :p
[19:11:43] <companion_cube> personally I'd hate working on a linker
[19:11:51] <companion_cube> seems annoying and not too interesting
[19:12:43] <gwozniak> cb: thing is, a compiler and linker are intimately linked. Some really good optimizations can only be done effectively in the linker
[19:13:08] <gwozniak> Linkers are much more interesting than they used to be
[19:13:24] <companion_cube> what kind of optimizations, gwozniak?
[19:13:40] <gwozniak> Full program ones, like outlining
[19:14:10] <gwozniak> Better placement of functions to use smaller instructions, reduce constant pool sizes, etc.
[19:14:13] <companion_cube> is that extraction of parts of functions into other functions?
[19:14:17] <companion_cube> wow, I see
[19:14:44] <gwozniak> The complier can't do that because it needs the whole program to do it, including libraries
[19:15:53] <gwozniak> Granted, it's mostly code size optimizations you get there, but that matters for large programs too, for caching reasons
[19:16:13] <gwozniak> On embedded systems, that's not much of a concern
[19:16:28] <cb> gwozniak: for me i got into linkers bc they are such a massive bottleneck
[19:16:34] <ngoldbaum> LTO can make a substantial difference too
[19:16:37] <cb> compilation units? embarassingly parallel, don't have to think about it
[19:16:44] <gwozniak> LTO can do so much
[19:16:44] <cb> a linker? that requires some thought to optimize
[19:16:51] <cb> and they can be real pieces of shit
[19:17:08] <cb> and IMHO linking and compiling seem like unncessary steps nowadays
[19:17:10] <gwozniak> Linkers were not helped by the molasses that is GNU ld
[19:17:16] <cb> why not just do it all at once?
[19:17:31] <gwozniak> You need the whole program, which you typically don't have
[19:17:44] <gwozniak> Namely the libraries
[19:18:00] <cb> well this ties into my whole-system school of thought - we're basically constrainted by the unix model
[19:18:13] <cb> linker optimizations or skipping entire steps are impossible because of our current model
[19:18:14] <companion_cube> cb: separate compilation makes compilation faster, no?
[19:18:19] <companion_cube> since you can cache a lot of it, often
[19:18:35] <gwozniak> Partly.  But sometimes you have to split a program up and put it together later
[19:18:52] <cb> gwozniak: my comment too is more directed at the people who design languages and compiles but fail to think of the steps after or handwave it
[19:18:56] <ngoldbaum> also profile guided optimization to make sure frequently used code paths have good cache characteristics
[19:18:58] <gwozniak> And yes, separate compilation is very helpful
[19:19:11] <cb> i also think the C header model is kinda silly and leads to a lot of redundancy in those sep compilation units
[19:19:15] <ngoldbaum> that requires having the whole program actually compiled first
[19:19:22] <gwozniak> C header model is awful
[19:19:32] <cb> the unix world seems pretty hostile to precompiled headers and its only a bandaid anyways
[19:19:36] <cb> a real module sys would be v nice
[19:19:58] <gwozniak> ngoldbaum: full program optimization is where it's at, tbh
[19:20:20] <gwozniak> You won't get much at the function level these days
[19:20:51] <mouseghost> gwozniak, technically you dont need to use headers
[19:20:57] <gwozniak> Sadly, GCC is architected around the "one function at a time" approach, and so LTO is a bolted on garbage fire
[19:22:06] <gwozniak> mouseghost: maybe not, but then you'll be declaring a lot of things "extern" manually and hopefully you get the types right
[19:22:25] <cb> K&R didn't have function declarations which made coee == data
[19:22:29] <cb> so it's better
[19:22:36] <mouseghost> gwozniak, i dont quite understand what you mean

[19:27:05] <prussian> cb: that second comment though...
[19:27:07] <ngoldbaum> i wonder if the internals of icc are any less of a garbage fire than gcc
[19:27:14] <prussian> that's some hell right there.
[19:27:54] <gwozniak> prussian: yeah, it's pretty terrible
[19:29:08] <prussian> jesus. this is one long ass thread.
[19:29:33] <gwozniak> The worst part about convincing people who think old C was well thought out is the super-subtle bugs that result from it
[19:30:54] <gwozniak> Like, where you're debugging opcodes because the size of something was wrong or the type was converted in a non-obvious way
[19:31:12] <companion_cube> cb: it's quite clear the C headers were done in a hurry, and no one revisited them afterwards‚Ä¶
[19:31:32] <gwozniak> Silent data corruption is right up there with the worst thing to debug
[19:31:35] <companion_cube> even though module systems happened pretty soon after (or even at the same time? isn't modula also 197x ?)
[19:32:46] <ngoldbaum> gwozniak: love to debug things where the stack trace i get is random and never where the actual problem is
[19:33:29] <cb> companion_cube: Ackshually, it's jUst Text
[19:33:33] <cb> which makes it better
[19:33:47] <gwozniak> ngoldbaum: I discovered a bug that would cause it and writing a test case for it was very tricky, but if it happened in the wild, it would have been murder to figure out
[19:33:57] <cb> because you can use ANOTHER text processing dsl (cpp)
[19:34:20] <cb> the most text you have the more unix you are
[19:34:21] <gwozniak> Like literally, the one value would have to be higher that 65536 or something like that for it to show up
[19:34:43] <ngoldbaum> i had to debug an issue in cython caused by cython not generating correct OpenMP code once, that was no fun
[19:35:23] <ngoldbaum> race codition but the code i wrote is correct but the generated C code is racey but only way to see that is to have a deep understanding of the openmp spec
[19:35:34] <companion_cube> cb: yikes
[19:35:37] <ngoldbaum> that was the day i realized cython has some very sharp edges
[19:35:39] <companion_cube> so terrible
[19:35:48] <cb> i love how unix has several text processing DSLs
[19:35:51] <cb> and all of them are shit
[19:36:03] <cb> can you name them all?
[19:36:08] <companion_cube> wouldn't the world be better if unix adopted S-exprs‚Ä¶
[19:36:14] <cb> ngoldbaum: i do a lot of runtime hacking as a hobby and job
[19:36:36] <cb> you'd be surprised how different the internals are from the language itself
[19:37:23] <manicennui> They have played us programmers for absolute fools!
[19:38:15] <companion_cube> OCaml does separate compilation pretty well, imho
[19:38:25] <companion_cube> there's a ton of file formats, but they all serve a role
[19:38:32] <gwozniak> cb: m4! cpp! awk! sed!
[19:38:34] <companion_cube> even for cross module inlining
[19:40:07] <prussian> manicennui: this. so true.
[19:40:30] <prussian> don't forget envsubst
[19:40:34] <manicennui> prussian: I'm referring to a video that I don't want to link to again.
[19:40:41] <prussian> probably at least 10 other ones.
[19:40:46] <prussian> oh ok

[19:47:59] <companion_cube> what if shells actually had structured data??
[19:48:10] <river> ugh!
[19:48:23] <river> sed is one i like actually
[19:48:40] <river> i wonder if DLS are actually bad
[19:48:44] <river> DSLs*
[19:49:00] <river> instead of a bunch of DSLs maybe we should just have 1 good language
[19:51:59] <ngoldbaum> domain specific shart
[19:52:49] <prussian> one dsl to rule them all?
[19:53:01] <companion_cube> is there a "good language" everyone agrees on? :p
[19:53:02] <prussian> seems counter to dsl, no?
[19:53:34] <gwozniak> We'll always have DSLs.  Maybe structured data would be better, though
[19:54:00] <companion_cube> now I'm angry because I don't have maps or tuples in the shell :p
[19:54:05] <companion_cube> it'd be so fucking nice
[19:54:06] <gwozniak> Plain text piping is handy sometimes, but having it be the only way isn't enough, imo
[19:54:16] <companion_cube> you could pipe structured data, really
[19:54:19] <river> agreed!
[19:54:21] <gwozniak> companion_cube: yeah, I would really appreciate that
[19:58:18] <Brekkjern> It's not actually plain text piping though
[19:58:24] <Brekkjern> That's the thing that annoys me
[19:58:39] <Brekkjern> If you want to render it at any point, you first have to interpret the stream of bytes and guess the encoding
[19:59:01] <river> yeah
[19:59:03] <Brekkjern> The fact that the majority of symbols commonly seen in a terminal maps well to ASCII is just a coincidence
[19:59:06] <ngoldbaum> i would simply use an easily guessable encoding
[19:59:08] <river> data needs to include its own description
[19:59:08] <Brekkjern> Or "coincidence"
[19:59:15] <ngoldbaum> like latin-1
[19:59:48] <Brekkjern> The most obvious encoding depends on the users environment, and we're back to complexity again
[20:01:36] <ngoldbaum> ok then, JIS encoding
[20:02:29] <gwozniak> Bring back code pages! /s
[20:03:18] <prussian> TRON
[20:03:23] <prussian> is clearly what we need.
[20:04:14] <ngoldbaum> mmm memorizing octal codes
[20:04:27] <prussian> gwozniak: this. and make sure to label the code pages with the wrong names too.
[20:04:30] <prussian> for extra fun
[20:06:31] <gwozniak> And put them in environment variables that can be altered by the program
[20:07:02] <gwozniak> Because *that* was a sane idea
[20:07:35] <prussian> genius. ship it.
[20:08:21] <prussian> I remember trying to reverse engineer some "plaintext" thermal printer's command language and all the code-pages I could find documented were just wrong.
[20:08:33] <prussian> god I hate printers.
[20:09:18] <prussian> i just hope the docs I had were out of date, but work wasn't going to pay epson for the sdk/docs.
[20:19:15] <goodger[m]> oh look he's done it again
[20:20:43] <goodger[m]> maybe I should preemptively add ‚Äòpond,‚Äô ‚Äòstream‚Äô and ‚Äòoxbowlake‚Äô to my ignore list
[20:20:51] <goodger[m]> get ahead of the curve
[20:29:10] <cb> bro i debug codepage bullshit as part of my job
[20:29:28] <cb> ebcdic is a reality
[20:29:36] <cb> gwozniak knows my suffering
[20:30:54] <river> I refuse to believe that ebcdic is real
[20:32:03] <cb> it is!@@@@@@@@@@@@
[20:32:32] <river> sure.. next you'll tell me about a 3rd kind of endianness
[20:40:24] <cb> pdp-11: exists
[20:40:38] <cb> or better, honeywell endian
[20:42:46] <river> "Middle-endian machines like the Honeywell 316 above complicate this even further"
[20:42:48] <river> oh fantastic
[20:43:25] <cb> good thing we dont have bit endianness
[20:48:39] <indigo> HN is still butthurt about Apple
[20:48:58] <bkero> If only they could do something about it.
[20:49:07] <bkero> (crying into their iPhones)
[20:49:49] <companion_cube> they're very butthurt
[20:50:45] <bkero> Boycott and divets?
[20:50:47] <bkero> divest*
[20:51:15] <companion_cube> some think they still have influence over what normies buy
[20:51:20] <companion_cube> because of their tech aura
[20:51:26] <companion_cube> üòì
[20:53:16] <bkero> They do have the influence of their stock and instruments containing the stock
[20:53:29] <bkero> and yes, halo devices exist
[20:53:40] <bkero> and the hype machine is dependent on techies
[20:54:26] <companion_cube> not for established brands like Apple
[20:54:28] <companion_cube> not anymor
[20:54:31] <companion_cube> e
[20:55:05] <bkero> What of those doesn't Apple have?
[20:56:31] <companion_cube> the hype machine of Apple has long escaped the circles of techies
[20:56:44] <companion_cube> people buy iPhones without their geek nephew telling them to
[20:59:07] *** Quits: mouseghost (~draco@user/mouseghost) (Quit: mew wew)
[21:03:16] <bkero> Not their newphew anymore, sure
[21:03:20] <bkero> but newspaper and news sites
[21:03:42] <bkero> which I suppose isn't much different than non-hype-driven
[21:04:01] <companion_cube> there might be a few newspaper articles on that
[21:04:05] <companion_cube> and then everyone else will forget
[21:11:29] <manicennui> I did not realize that the first Suicide Squad movie won an Oscar for makeup. The movie was terrible.
[21:13:54] <river> for makeup? huh
[21:14:14] <river> I saw a cool analysis comparing it with birds of prey
[21:14:59] <cb> tbh it's because an apple device tends to be more interesting launch wise than most products
[21:16:03] <river> that's certainly true
[21:16:14] <river> i think i watched the last apple release thing
[21:16:24] <manicennui> Birds of Prey was worth a single watch.
[21:16:28] <river> those screens seem really good
[21:16:30] <river> yeah i liked it!
[21:16:32] <manicennui> The original Suicide Squad can be skipped entirely.
[21:16:35] <river> haha
[21:16:38] <manicennui> The new Suicide Squad is really entertaining.
[21:16:49] <manicennui> Typical James Gunn comic book movie.
[21:16:51] <river> didn't realize it was out yet
[21:17:10] <manicennui> I've already watched it twice on HBO Max.
[21:18:11] <manicennui> I can't get enough of dopey King Shark voiced by Sly.
[21:19:21] <cb> i dont care about capeshit, so
[21:19:21] <river> :)
[21:20:22] <manicennui> King Shark doesn't wear a cape.
[21:21:11] <ngoldbaum> i heard the new suicide squad is not terrible
[21:21:24] <ngoldbaum> why they needed to make two of those movies in quick succession otoh‚Ä¶
[21:21:31] <companion_cube> the answer is money
[21:21:36] <manicennui> Two of which movies?
[21:21:41] <ngoldbaum> suicide squad
[21:21:46] <manicennui> The last one was 4 years ago.
[21:22:04] <ngoldbaum> 4 years seems short for time between reboots
[21:22:17] <manicennui> The first one was terrible.
[21:22:24] <manicennui> And they got James Gunn, who is a known quantity.
[21:22:47] *** Joins: sudoforge (~sudoforge@wireguard/tunneler/sudoforge)
[21:23:00] <manicennui> I'd put the new SS in the top ten of DC/Marvel movies from the last decade.
[21:23:11] <manicennui> If you liked GOTG, you'll probably like this.
[21:23:31] <manicennui> I also can't stand the Avengers movies, if that helps you decide.
[21:24:37] <manicennui> The only parts of Infinity War that I really enjoyed were the parts with GOTG and Thor.
[21:24:59] <indigo> I liked Infinity War + Endgame, but the first two were terrible
[21:25:04] <indigo> Ultron was the worst to me IMO
[21:25:44] <manicennui> I really only enjoy the movies directed by Gunn and Waititi.
[21:26:09] <manicennui> Some of the others are watchable.
[21:26:22] <manicennui> I could not understand why I was supposed to care about characters like Tony Stark.
[21:26:28] <indigo> Gunn got fired by Disney, right?
[21:26:47] <manicennui> Yes, because of some tweets from like a decade ago.
[21:26:51] <manicennui> They also rehired him.
[21:26:57] <indigo> Oh cool
[21:27:00] <manicennui> He is doing GOTG3 and a GOTG Holiday Special.
[21:27:32] <manicennui> I think there is some real potential with some of the new Disney+ shows.
[21:27:46] <indigo> My wife and I are actually rewatching all of the MCU movies right now
[21:27:48] <manicennui> Really excited about Oscar Isaac as Moon Knight.
[21:27:52] <indigo> We're halfway through GOTG2
[21:28:22] <manicennui> And I basically have to watch the Blade movie, because I like Blade and Mahershala Ali.
[21:28:26] <ngoldbaum> i really liked loki
[21:28:32] <ngoldbaum> eps 4 and 5 especially
[21:28:47] <manicennui> I have not subscribed yet, but the new What If? series might push me over the edge.
[21:28:54] <manicennui> And then I'll watch Wandavision and Loki.
[21:28:57] <ngoldbaum> wandavision was also great
[21:29:24] <manicennui> I'll skip all of the Avenger adjacent stuff.
[21:29:30] <manicennui> Like Falcon.
[21:29:42] <manicennui> I'll watch all of the weird stuff.
[21:29:51] <ngoldbaum> falcon and the winter soldier was terrible
[21:30:02] <manicennui> I didn't know about their Premier access until recently.
[21:30:15] <manicennui> People pay $30 for immediate access to movies in theaters.
[21:30:19] <ngoldbaum> they could have taken it to interesting places but definitely didn‚Äôy
[21:30:26] <manicennui> And then those movies end up on the service several months later.
[21:30:38] <manicennui> I just never liked Falcon nor Bucky.
[21:30:44] <ngoldbaum> also apparently it was supposed to be about a pandemic and they hastily rewrote it and it shows
[21:30:53] <manicennui> I never cared about most of the MCU characters.
[21:31:31] <manicennui> Between that, the formulaic plots, and how pointless most of the movies turned out to be in the grand scheme of thing (e.g. Civil War), I can't enjoy most of the MCU.
[21:31:41] <companion_cube> superhero movies suck
[21:31:43] <companion_cube> all of them
[21:32:06] <manicennui> companion_cube: I'd defend at least the first GOTG.
[21:32:25] <companion_cube> it's just so conventional
[21:32:30] <companion_cube> there's 0 surprises
[21:32:40] <companion_cube> but then no hollywood movie has surprises these days I guess
[21:32:40] <manicennui> I mean, so are most action movies.
[21:32:46] <companion_cube> yeah
[21:33:47] <manicennui> It's hard to think about whether movies like Terminator/T2, Predator, and Alien/Aliens were surprising at the time.
[21:34:18] <manicennui> But I think action movies mostly peaked in the 80s/90s.
[21:34:18] <companion_cube> a bit more, I think?
[21:34:26] <manicennui> Matrix is one movie I remember being surprised by.
[21:34:27] <companion_cube> Alien is more horror than just action
[21:34:34] <companion_cube> for sure
[21:35:08] <companion_cube> I watched "double jeopardy" last year, it was really good; but similarly it's a thriller, not just an action movie where you feel like there's 0 stakes because all the action is so predictable
[21:35:29] <manicennui> Yeah, the lack of actual tension is a real problem in these movies.
[21:35:48] <manicennui> Other than Infinity War/End Game, there was no chance of main characters dying.
[21:35:55] <manicennui> Although that isn't true in the new Suicide Squad.
[21:36:11] <manicennui> It is R-rated and lots of characters die.
[21:36:22] <companion_cube> > lack of tension
[21:36:28] <companion_cube> thank you for expressing what I meant in a better way :)
[21:37:05] <manicennui> It's one of the reasons why I can't stand Civil War, which other people seem to love.
[21:37:20] <manicennui> It was just a bunch of idiots I didn't care about bashing into each other for 30 minutes.
[21:37:27] <manicennui> I can't even remember the rest of the movie.
[21:37:40] <companion_cube> GoT got really famous partly because it subverted expectations at the end of season 1
[21:37:41] <manicennui> And it had absolutely no impact on anything after.
[21:37:49] <companion_cube> (and reiterated later, red wedding, etc.)
[21:38:01] <manicennui> Yeah, I was watching a video about what is wrong with the later seasons.
[21:38:16] <companion_cube> yeah
[21:38:24] <companion_cube> they got off the rails once they went further than the books
[21:38:27] <manicennui> And the creator of the video basically boiled it down to running out of the source material, and believing that it was just about having twists.
[21:38:27] <companion_cube> and badly
[21:38:41] <companion_cube> did you per chance watch Lindsay Ellis' takes
[21:38:44] <companion_cube> ?
[21:38:47] <manicennui> Not understanding how to subvert expectations in a good way.
[21:38:52] <manicennui> I don't think so.
[21:38:56] <companion_cube> or even in a logical way
[21:39:02] <companion_cube> characters die for a reason
[21:39:34] <manicennui> I honestly don't know how they could have stopped the Ice King in a way that was satisfying though.
[21:39:46] <manicennui> And I haven't heard anyone come up with a plausible idea.
[21:39:50] <manicennui> It was just too built up.
[21:40:33] <manicennui> About the only suggestion that I've heard that make some amount of sense is that he should have first "won" a bit.
[21:40:39] <manicennui> And taken over part of Westeros.
[21:40:59] <ngoldbaum> there‚Äôs a reason grrm stopped writing main series books
[21:41:17] <ngoldbaum> it‚Äôs not actually possible to end the series in a satisfying way
[21:42:17] <manicennui> It's basically a really well done soap opera.
[21:42:32] <companion_cube> manicennui: maybe the whole dragon thing was a mistake :p
[21:42:34] <manicennui> Do soap operas ever really end unless their ratings tank?
[21:43:38] <manicennui> I actually figured it would end with Daenerys on the throne, but hinting at the fact that she was becoming a tyrant.
[21:43:50] <companion_cube> ngoldbaum: is there not?
[21:43:53] <manicennui> Basically the typical "nothing really changes" ending.
[21:44:02] <companion_cube> I forget if the books truly imply that the wrights are like zombies
[21:44:35] <ngoldbaum> aiui the end of the tv show is based on grrm‚Äôs ideas circa 2015 or so about how the series would end
[21:44:44] <ngoldbaum> doubt he‚Äôs come up with anything better
[21:44:56] <ngoldbaum> although hodor being really hold the door was clever
[21:46:33] <manicennui> Someone speculated that he is waiting for the hype from the show to die down before he finishes.
[21:47:32] <manicennui> I wonder how passionate he is about actually finishing.
[21:47:58] <ngoldbaum> he‚Äôs been writing books about the interesting but underwritten parts of westeros‚Äô history for a while
[21:48:00] <manicennui> He is quite old, and probably very financially comfortable at this point.
[21:48:11] <ngoldbaum> and he‚Äôs working on a tv show set hundreds of years before the main show
[21:48:15] <companion_cube> it must feel like‚Ä¶ unfinished business tho
[21:48:20] <ngoldbaum> soooo‚Ä¶ tells you what he finds interesting
[21:51:26] <manicennui> I found it interesting that he has also written sci-fi.
