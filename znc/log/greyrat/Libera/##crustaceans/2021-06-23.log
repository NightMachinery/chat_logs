[23:07:30] <kirch> cow-orkers are thinking of spinning up a vm to compile sass on-demand... which sounds like overkill (but we currently only use node for some testing)
[23:11:07] *** Joins: riv (~river@tilde.team/user/river)
[23:16:10] <aleph> cb: Well that was an epic whooshing alright
[23:17:16] <hoistbypetard> is it still a whoosh when it's as willful as that?
[23:17:26] <companion_cube> I want to ask why on earth is vaccination status linked to ideology
[23:17:33] <companion_cube> but that'd be non constructive
[23:19:20] <ngoldbaum> finally found a prospective landlord with a wheelchair accessible property
[23:19:23] <ngoldbaum> unicorns do exist
[23:20:41] <Brekkjern> companion_cube: It isn't unless you use it as a proxy for some other concept
[23:20:48] <Brekkjern> Which he probably does
[23:20:56] <ngoldbaum> cb: lmao hwayne with the low-hanging fruit
[23:21:56] <hoistbypetard> ngoldbaum: those seem common here (DC metro area), though i've not actually tried to rent such a property. it's easy to imagine it'd be hard to actually close.
[23:22:36] <ngoldbaum> apartments for sure exist but i don‚Äôt want to deal with building management changing under me and other such hijinks
[23:23:06] <ngoldbaum> most houses and townhomes around here predate ADA or are in terrible locations close to DIA or Buckley AFB
[23:23:43] <ngoldbaum> and even if they‚Äôre newish construction it‚Äôs not uncommon for architects to try to jam more crap into a home by making bathroom doors 24‚Äù closet doors
[23:23:47] <aleph> I may have to move
[23:23:48] <companion_cube> right now I'm kind of wishing there was a section "vaccinated only" on planes
[23:23:53] <aleph> I'm not looking forward to it
[23:24:05] <companion_cube> with the unvaccinated at the back of the bus^W plane
[23:24:11] <hoistbypetard> ugh. hope your prospective landlord pans out, then :)
[23:24:14] <ngoldbaum> companion_cube: planes are pretty safe, airports less so, n-95 masks are also obtainable now
[23:24:28] <companion_cube> I'm not worried for me, but we're travelling with a baby :/
[23:24:46] * ngoldbaum wonders if they make smol n-95s
[23:24:53] <hoistbypetard> companion_cube: I'd drive
[23:25:23] <hoistbypetard> (and plan to, traveling in August with 2 unvaccinated children to see family where we'd normally fly.)
[23:25:40] *** Quits: mercerist (~mercerist@user/mercerist) (Ping timeout: 268 seconds)
[23:25:40] <companion_cube> we thought about that
[23:25:54] <companion_cube> but 6 days of driving (to get there and back) are also a real risk :/
[23:26:03] <Geekingfrog> how about cycling ?
[23:26:07] <ngoldbaum> hopefully they‚Äôll approve the mrna vaccines for kids by august :/
[23:26:30] <hoistbypetard> yeah, 6 days is a long time to drive
[23:26:44] <companion_cube> Geekingfrog: :D
[23:27:00] <ngoldbaum> cross-country road trips are fun in moderation
[23:27:01] <hoistbypetard> the last i heard, october was realistic for ages 4-12
[23:27:02] <companion_cube> I mean it's DC <-> Austin TX
[23:27:05] <companion_cube> crazy shit
[23:27:08] <ngoldbaum> and with someone to switch off driving with
[23:27:17] <ngoldbaum> oh but that‚Äôs a shit drive in thebsummer
[23:28:02] <Geekingfrog> otherwise you could go private jet companion_cube (https://www.flyvictor.com) but that may be a bit expensive
[23:28:06] <companion_cube> :DDDDDDDD

[23:28:15] <companion_cube> thank you Geekingfrog, I expected as much from you
[23:28:24] <Geekingfrog> always there
[23:28:52] <companion_cube> you could row a boat from London and meet me on the potomac
[23:29:25] <companion_cube> (gasp, I'm doxing Geekingfrog)
[23:30:38] <Geekingfrog> It's only about 800km
[23:30:43] <goodger> monstruous
[23:32:34] <hoistbypetard> https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/06/153-hospital-workers-quit-or-were-fired-after-refusing-covid-19-vaccine/ starts off as such a happy story until the last line...

[23:32:40] <hoistbypetard> "She also told the AP that Tuesday was her first day at a new job with a company that will send her and other unvaccinated nurses into people‚Äôs homes to provide care."
[23:32:44] <companion_cube> > 800km
[23:32:47] <companion_cube> fake :D

[23:34:23] <Geekingfrog> not sure I can row all the way though
[23:34:34] <ngoldbaum> FDA doing a formal authorization for the mrna vaccines would certainly help too‚Ä¶
[23:34:59] <companion_cube> :D damn
[23:35:21] <companion_cube> wonder if it's named after Jack London now
[23:35:37] <companion_cube> Geekingfrog: might take more than 166hr if you row though.
[23:35:43] <companion_cube> roads aren't super rowable.
[23:39:23] <hoistbypetard> it would seem at this point that we have more evidence for safety and effectiveness than we usually do at the point where drugs get formally authorized
[23:39:33] <hoistbypetard> by quite some distance
[23:40:16] <Geekingfrog> how does that usually work for long term potential side effects?
[23:40:17] <companion_cube> bUt WhAt AbOuT LonG TeRm SiDe EfFeCtS
[23:40:30] <companion_cube> oops :D
[23:40:38] <companion_cube> I need a script for that one too, grr

[23:42:28] <hoistbypetard> i think long-term things are usually done as "post-marketing" studies after approval
[23:42:33] *** Joins: mercerist (~mercerist@user/mercerist)
[23:42:43] <hoistbypetard> the real approval process is slow, but not that slow
[23:42:50] <ngoldbaum> Geekingfrog: it‚Äôs impossible to judge long term side effects in a phase 3 trial for a vaccine, afaiu they generally don‚Äôt check for long-term side effects before formally approving after a phase 3 trial
[23:43:49] <companion_cube> :D
[23:44:03] <companion_cube> at this point I've has so many vaccines anyway
[23:50:17] <prussian> based on how the vaccine is intended to work, i'd be surprised to learn of any long term potential issue.
[23:50:41] <ngoldbaum> yeah, the mrna is gone from
[23:50:45] <ngoldbaum> your system quickly
[23:51:12] <ngoldbaum> the spike proteins longer but just like other inert junk it gets cleared out or breaks down as well

[23:55:20] <prussian> ya not worried
[23:55:39] <companion_cube> still beats long term effects of the virus itself
[23:55:50] <companion_cube> how is that not seen as the other possibility
[23:56:00] <prussian> i don't know
[23:56:01] <ngoldbaum> companion_cube: covid is natural
[23:56:10] <ngoldbaum> wouldn‚Äôt want to put any chemicals in your body
[23:56:15] <companion_cube> :DDDDDDDD
[23:56:18] <ngoldbaum> also bill gates 5g q
[23:56:22] <companion_cube> my brain hurts ffs
[23:56:59] <companion_cube> if bill gates wants to give me 5g I'd gladly accept as a repayment from these windows licenses I bought in the past
[23:57:21] <prussian> I have plenty of loons (mostly family) on whatever spectrum or theory you want, and I still can't glean the basis for their hesitance. even more paradoxical are the ones I know got the Janssen one and still act like it's some... scam/conspiracy/whatever.
[23:57:29] *** Joins: mercerist (~mercerist@user/mercerist)
[23:58:34] <ngoldbaum> gonna go over well when the recommendation for everyone who got janssen to get an mrna shot comes out
[23:58:56] <prussian> lol...
[23:58:59] <prussian> well. ya.
