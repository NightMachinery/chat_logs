[02:15:08] <alystair> well I'm in a position where a library does some magic. One converts <form> name attribute into an API query string, another utilizes function names as part of a hook/integration system. The problem being that form names utilize dashes, whilst function names are camelCased. I could have an internal funct that converts the form name to camelCase but then it feels a bit inconsistent... might
[02:15:08] <alystair> be the easiest way out assuming it's well documented...

[05:12:39] <Crash1hd> if I have a string say x = "AAA" and I am wanting to do a check say  y = (x.length - 3) * 5 to get a new value for y but I do not want the x.length - 3 to go anyless than 3 so say x = "AA" I still want the output inside the (x.length - 3) to either be 0 or greater?
[05:16:03] <pavonia> Not sure I understand correctly, but perhaps Math.min(0, x.length - 3)
[05:16:12] <pavonia> Err Math.max
[05:16:36] <Crash1hd> pavonia, ok, I am thinking that maybe Math.abs
[05:17:23] <pavonia> It depends on what you want the results to be if length < 3
[05:17:39] <Crash1hd> Yeah. well mostly did not want it to go into the negative.
[05:18:33] <Crash1hd> problem is that when empty its 3 when just single string its 1 etc.. I want if there is 3 or less for it to be 0
[05:18:47] <Crash1hd> and on the 4th letter and above start at 1, 2 etc
[05:19:23] <pavonia> Then use the Math.max version
[05:19:50] <pavonia> n> [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7].map(x => Math.max(0, x))
[05:19:51] <jellobot> (okay) [ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 ]

[05:20:00] <jellobot> (okay) [ 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 ]

[06:56:04] <powftw> Do you remember this? I was actually trying to add one more feature to this. We already get the selected line number. Can we make an index number per line? My intention is to get every words before selection in that line. I was thinking if evey word has index number, I could minus from it to reach the beginning of the line thus getting all text before it.
[06:57:13] <powftw> Another way is to get the entire text in that line and the selected text index number to backend,  I could then loop through the line as a list and get all words before our selected text.
[06:57:21] <powftw> What method do you prefer?

[09:00:49] <teut> is this this valid?   given that you have files with named component1.js, component2.js, component3.js
[09:01:06] <teut> and yes correcting the template string

[09:04:07] <teut> because you said no
[09:04:45] <systemfault> I don't do React, I just know that you cannot do that with imports.
[09:05:02] <systemfault> Imports are static....
[09:07:48] <teut> https://dpaste.org/91Je
[09:07:55] <teut> I want to do this kind of stuff
[09:08:14] <teut> component will be the name of the file which has component
[09:09:04] <systemfault> Then you need dynamic imports (Just google'd React.Lazy, it's pretty much doing that)

On chrome (96.0.4664.45 (Official Build) (64-bit) ubuntu) the text is weirdly resized as soon as the mouse pointer touches it. The same issue doesn't happen with Firefox (94.0), nor with Chromium (96.0.4664.45). Any idea of how to fix it? thanks

[19:16:49] <jsmooth> I may have missed an answer to this, but I'll ask again since I hadn't seen one with a scroll. For developing a front-end app that will use server-side databasing, without having a server-side script/API in place. The current idea is having a mock API using hard-coded JSON embedded data with app set to testing mode, otherwise same API calls would be made, but to real server-side API end-point instead. Is there anything already available for making this

If you want to avoid having a server at all then you're looking at mocking your HTTP library (like fetch or axios) which is probably going to be more pain than it is worth for interactive testing.

[20:23:59] <Deneb> I am still trying to get my head around why I can't access elements in my array from this particular function that I am building. The array object evidently exists, but is empty when it shouldn't be.

I am wondering whether
[20:23:59] <Deneb> myobj.style.display="none" which closes the controls window is then clearing the global array variable.

[22:03:55] <systemfault> The advantage of functional programming, and not using loops, is that it shows the intent of the programmer better than a loop could do (it also removes the possibility of off-by-1 errors). By using some/every as a weird way to stop an iteration in the middle of it, you're just throwing that advantage out of the window.

[23:31:21] <systemfault> It can mean to use ESM modules directly in the browser.. (something nobody does) It can mean to use CommonJS modules and webpack to bundle them into an app... it can mean to use ESM imports and use webpack to bundle them...
[23:32:14] <earendel> Daneb: if it's a module, only exported things are accessible. yet if you export a class, you export all its members as well.

[23:36:17] <Deneb> so, I have a .js file with a class. I have a utility function outside the class. As soon as I add the .js file using <script> tags to the html page, won't both the class and utility function become accessible? So I'm trying to work out how to implement this as systemfault said, so that the class is visible but the function is NOT exported. I see from googling that there is an export keyword in ECMAScript 6, but I suppose I need the opposite.

[23:39:48] <Dorward> @Deneb:  export and import are only used if you have <script type="module">, otherwise any global variable in one script is available in all scripts
[23:40:54] <silly_> Dorward, we're mostly taking about bundled js here

[23:41:11] <earendel> there's a special type of script, which is called es-module. on in that scripts you can use the export keyword, which then would work as you expect. (hiding away your utility function)
[23:41:12] <Dorward> Ah, missed the context.
[23:41:55] <silly_> Dorward, wait, i think i missed the context...
[23:42:03] <Deneb> earendel: so if I export my class using the export keyword, but not anything else, then only the class will be available?
[23:42:46] <Deneb> Dorward: wasn't aware of that one either

[23:45:13] <earendel> the class and its members yes. you will have to use that type="module" script reference. and i think you need to name that script with the correct extension as well. which was not .js but

[23:49:26] <Deneb> just reading and article on MDN and it does say its a good idea to use .mjs to identify which files are modules. It then goes on to say that "some tools may never support .mjs" and then goes on to use .js in all the examples...

[23:51:27] <systemfault> ESM in general is an unwanted solution to a non-existing problem...
[23:51:53] <systemfault> Was written by people who I sometimes wonder if they have written actual real-world JS.
[23:54:36] <systemfault> As far the browser is concerned, nobody uses "real ESM" (native browser ESM support). What we do is to use the ESM "syntax" then use babel and/or webpack(or any other bundler) to compile it to whatever format it uses internally.
[23:55:30] <lantech19446> What exactly is ESM, I noticed that zsoc used it in the software they wrote for me
[23:55:34] <earendel> which adds to the oddity
[23:55:40] *** Joins: Booster2ooo (~Booster2o@user/booster2ooo)
[23:55:42] <systemfault> So, real ESM provides no advantage for the browser... as NodeJS already had a pretty good module system (CommonJS)
[23:55:52] <systemfault> s/as/and
[23:56:27] <systemfault> lantech19446: Native "modules" (think includes/imports in other languages)
[23:56:59] <systemfault> lantech19446: You can have a add.mjs module that exports a function to add 2 numbers... then just import it in another file foo.mjs and use it.
[23:57:11] <systemfault> Without precompilation step... or bundling... or anything.
[23:57:25] <Deneb> so I have converted that example to a class and it works. So long as I can hide that populate() function from the rest of the application that would be a solution - https://jsfiddle.net/u8zhvfgw/26/
[23:57:31] <lantech19446> o ok, that might be some of the stuff i don't understand in their code then. I wanted to add some functionality too it but I don't understand it well enough to do it
[23:57:35] <earendel> it's pointless to use esm instead of cjs, if you're using babel, bundlers and co
[23:57:43] <Deneb> I do think the class approach is actually neater.
[23:58:09] <systemfault> The only thing I like from ESM, is the syntax... but that's highly subjective.
[23:58:30] <earendel> it's not even javascript.
[23:58:41] <stenno> ljharb: sorry for not looking closely at your example earlier, that was a real brainfart
