[01:46:42] <Joanna> So the bots trying to log in only know about the root account not other accounts you have with root level access? Is there a way hackers could get your other account names ?
[01:52:24] <Joanna> iz: fnk Hydragyrum
[01:55:38] <Joanna> Hi everyone
[02:04:02] <jan6> obviously not, unless you publish them somehow
[02:04:16] <jan6> easiest defense is simply obscurity ;P
[02:04:44] <jan6> rename "root" to "superuser", and boom, you've probably broken most automatic scripts
[02:05:03] <iz> there are other ways to enumerate accounts via other services
[02:05:19] <jan6> only if those services expicitly list 'em
[02:05:20] <iz> often smtp will have a vrfy command or crap like that
[02:05:45] <jan6> like yeah the vrfy, which has good intentions, it lets you check "do you really have user X?"
[02:05:58] <jan6> but they'd still have to know what they're looking for
[02:06:05] <iz> yeah, but lets them guess and check
[02:06:14] <jan6> it won't GIVE them accounts, it'll give them boolean status
[02:06:34] <iz> but if you just don't allow password ssh logins, you really don't have anything to fear from bruteforcers
[02:06:40] <iz> they are just looking for weak passwords
[02:06:53] <jan6> and they're not doing too good job at that
[02:06:54] <iz> b/c sometimes someone just leaves thies password as temp123 or whatever
[02:07:14] <jan6> I once left a VPS with root ssh enabled, and root's password was "toor"
[02:07:23] <jan6> it took like a week until I got alerts
[02:07:24] <jan6> lol
[02:18:40] <Joanna> I didn’t know you could rename root account to something else that’s a good idea
[02:26:13] <jan6> you can also have several accounts with the same UID
[02:26:18] <jan6> or name
[02:26:31] <Joanna> When someone tries to log in with an account that doesn’t exist do they get a message that it doesn’t exist or is it like online banking where it just says the login failed
[02:26:57] <jan6> if you have multiple with same UID or GID, then pretty much all tools will report the first username that comes up in passwd, and for groups I think it's the reverse order for some reason
[02:27:08] <jan6> login to where?
[02:27:15] <jan6> ssh just says login failed
[02:27:19] <Joanna> Why would you want accounts with same name .
[02:27:38] <Joanna> Oh ok so they can’t validate username
[02:28:14] <jan6> $ ssh ashdoashdoiahdohdaoisd@github.com
[02:28:15] <jan6> ashdoashdoiahdohdaoisd@github.com: Permission denied (publickey).
[02:28:53] <jan6> ssh doesn't know if there's an account, it just knows that you provided no credentials that would let you access the account
[02:29:13] <jan6> since y'know, the account info might be in ldap, or wherever else, not just unix passwd
[02:31:50] <Joanna> That’s interesting
[02:32:33] <Joanna> What if you make an account called root that is not allowed to do anything? Is that possible?
[02:32:48] <jan6> why not
[02:32:57] <jan6> I think ssh just uses PAM, anyway
[02:33:03] <Joanna> That’s like a honeypot
[02:33:30] <jan6> I know for a fact you can drop certain users into a chroot, or do other such per-user config changes
[02:33:58] <jan6> or enforce them to only be able to run a limited PATH of programs, i think, too
[02:34:05] <jan6> etc
[02:34:55] <Joanna> What is the reason for all the bots trying to get root access usually?
[02:35:18] <jan6> I mean, who doesn't love free root access on hosts you're not responsible for?
[02:35:21] <Joanna> I assume it happens a lot
[02:35:41] <Joanna> So for illegal stuff?
[02:36:14] <jan6> generally, yeah
[02:36:19] <jan6> same as all the stupid bots
[02:36:32] <jan6> trying to get easy access without much effort
[02:36:59] <jan6> why bother sitting and trying to bruteforce one box, when you can instead try the top 100 factory passwords on a million hosts?
[02:37:01] <Joanna> What is it used for usually ?
[02:37:23] <Joanna> Ddos attacks?
[02:37:30] <jan6> who knows, spam, of course, I assume ddos probably too
[02:38:44] <Joanna> I don’t understand why the people doing this can’t be found and stopped. I’ll assume they are using someone else’s computer?
[02:38:56] <jan6> "I'm behind 7 proxies!"
[02:39:01] <jan6> pretty much
[02:39:12] <jan6> it's just not worth the effort
[02:39:41] <jan6> just like it's not worth the effort to put every drug user in jail, or fine them, or whatever
[02:40:20] <Joanna> They could go after the isp making it possible..
[02:40:22] <jan6> people start trying to track these down once there's suspicion they're part of some organized group
[02:40:57] <Joanna> A remote computer isn’t a problem with no internet
[02:41:19] <jan6> it's not much use either
[02:41:58] <Joanna> Surely there is some way to stop cyber attacks
[02:44:02] <Joanna> Isn’t there a way to inform people that their computers are infected with malware that is trying to hack other computers? It’s all as if this is happening on purpose and getting worse with all the internet of things nonsense.
[02:54:03] <jan6> you act as if people aren't doing that
[02:54:39] <jan6> what else do you think the abuse and technical contacts are there for, registering domains, for example?
[02:55:07] <jan6> why else do you think there is abuse contacts at every step of the way?
[02:55:52] <jan6> there's abuse contacts for IPs, for DNS, for VPS providers, etc, and often instead of directly reporting away, you get some warning shot emails first
[02:57:26] <jan6> there's contacts for dns host, and for the domain owner, and for the domain's TLD
[02:57:54] <jan6> the internet is chock full of information a lot of which tells you who to talk to when X is causing issues
[02:58:28] <jan6> of course, the spammers and baddies often swap in and out of places quicky, hence not being bothered
[02:59:03] <jan6> you shut down this VPS? well, I got 17 others already, half of them finding new unsecured boxes
[02:59:08] <jan6> etc
[02:59:43] <jan6> you can't really do much, because internet, much like human society, is fundamentally based on trust
[03:03:08] <jan6> you can always go infinitely paranoid, "what if my ISP is MitMing my connections, and replacing all of my distro's CA certificates with their own? and live-modifying the install ISOs too? maybe they have the distro maintainers's keys! or maybe I never got their keys, and they were fake from the start!!!"

[18:32:20] <JimBuntu> I still have some stuff kicking around for auto-playing minecraft and that slither.io game
[18:35:04] <jan6> noice
[18:35:06] <jan6> using what?
[18:35:33] <jan6> directly hooking into the game? autohotkey-like macros? 
[18:36:18] <jan6> there's someone who's even made a full on AI to autoplay minecraft (and there's baritone & such which can do specific sequences, too)
[18:39:22] <JimBuntu> I have used a mix of things, none tying directly into the game, mostly autokey and kb/mouse control via command line.  To do things like aim, shoot, change item in hand over and over... for slither it was a simple mouse control that would maintain a tight circle
[18:40:41] <jan6> how'd you do aiming?
[18:40:44] <JimBuntu> I really only used those things for afk... like to stand at a mob farm and kill them for me, to get the xp.
[18:41:02] <JimBuntu> blind aiming without knowing what was on the screen at any specific time.
[18:41:18] <jan6> ah, alright, makes sense
[18:41:53] <jan6> for mobfarms you often don't even need any botting, lol
[18:42:12] <JimBuntu> I mean, I almost exclusively play in survival, so this was basically cheating but I resolved that in my mind by only doing it for highly repetitive tasks.
[18:42:41] <JimBuntu> greater loot drops with enchanted weapons plus the xp, is the reason at the mob farms
[18:42:58] <jan6> if you alt-tab away, then until very recently at least, you could keep hitting stuff, so like automining a cobble generator or such would be trivial

[18:43:36] <jan6> I think they changed that in 1.16 tho
[18:44:02] <jan6> yeah but I mean, I've never had a need to even bot such tasks, lol
[18:44:08] <jan6> not that I play much anyway
[18:44:25] <JimBuntu> I have several accounts too, so I have literally had several machines running overnight before or all day with each char in a different place auto-mining ;p

[18:45:59] <jan6> even without mending, it's pretty easy to make a long-loop dispenser to throw like, idk, stone swords at you, which doesn't get enchantments, but otherwise pretty simple and effective enough
[18:46:20] <JimBuntu> magma blocks really changed things for me too though, much quicker builds using those to autokill or even simply to auto-injure mobs
