[03:25:27] <maks25> What do you peeps use for APM?
[03:25:41] <PaulWay[w]> Fast mouse clicking.
[03:26:03] <maks25> lol
[03:26:22] <maks25> I like that
[03:26:25] <PaulWay[w]> Perhaps you'd like to tell us what you mean by APM :-)
[03:26:35] <maks25> application performance monitoring
[03:26:49] <maks25> identifying bottlenecks in the application
[03:27:01] <maks25> as well as general logging etc
[03:28:16] <maks25> I was looking at a better way to manage logs, then came upon APM software like dynatrace, datadog, newrelic etc. Got me curious as to what the django community uses to manage their stack
[03:28:43] <PaulWay[w]> Those work.
[03:28:58] <PaulWay[w]> Monitoring the response time at your HTTP server level works.
[03:29:10] <PaulWay[w]> Prometheus instrumentation in your application works.
[03:30:22] <maks25> What kinda blew me away was how dynatrace would break down the entire path of the request, even within the django app and identify how long each method, query etc takes on average
[03:30:35] <maks25> is that common?
[03:30:46] <maks25> I am pretty new to the world of APM
[03:31:04] <maks25> I mainly use sentry to identify problems..
[03:31:26] <hemebond> That's common of monitoring systems.
[03:31:35] <hemebond> And analytics.
[03:31:47] <maks25> IC, yea I could definitely benefit from that
[03:32:00] <PaulWay[w]> I think a benchmark set of requests is important here.
[03:32:03] <maks25> I've looked at that data within django-silk, but never live data
[03:32:34] <PaulWay[w]> It's one thing to say "our page loads are slow", but there are so many causes for that.
[03:32:41] <maks25> PaulWay[w]: what do you mean by that? As in test how long on average different requests should take?
[03:33:12] <PaulWay[w]> Basically, choose a core set of requests and set requirements on how long they take to answer.
[03:33:57] <PaulWay[w]> So you might say <1 sec performance on a simple API request, but <5 sec performance on a more complicated one.
[03:34:51] <PaulWay[w]> It's too easy to get lost in the detail of trying to speed up one particular request, without knowing whether that's used at all or is the reason your overall page load is slow.
[03:34:59] <maks25> That wont really work for our app. It is highly dependent on the user's content. The api requests in question can differ wildly because of that.
[03:35:10] <PaulWay[w]> Pick a user you care about.
[03:35:20] <PaulWay[w]> Pick the user with the most data.
[03:35:31] <PaulWay[w]> Pick the user that complains the most.
[03:35:32] <PaulWay[w]> Measure those.
[03:35:43] <maks25> Manually or within one of these APM?
[03:35:49] <PaulWay[w]> Any way you can.
[03:36:19] <maks25> You said you use "Prometheus instrumentation" for this?
[03:36:21] <PaulWay[w]> We have one customer that we have a very good relationship with but has been very critical of us in the past.  So that's the one we use in our benchmarks.
[03:36:42] <PaulWay[w]> We use it.  I'm not sure it contributes anything to our actual measurement.
[03:36:55] <maks25> Yea, makes sense. We would then use our largest customer, hence also the largest
[03:36:55] <PaulWay[w]> It was one of the other developers' ... enthusiasms.
[03:37:00] <maks25> ic
[03:37:25] <PaulWay[w]> The point I'm making in general here is: be careful about lying with statistics here.
[03:37:25] <maks25> I take it you're not a fan?
[03:37:39] <PaulWay[w]> I've never used it to find a performance problem.
[03:37:41] <maks25> Oh I wouldnt lie, or even use it for marketing
[03:37:50] <maks25> I just want to identify the bottlenecks without spending countless of hours of testing
[03:38:27] <maks25> I'd rather set something up and spend 50-100 bucks a month, or whatever the cost might be
[03:38:30] <PaulWay[w]> Lying with statistics here means picking the wrong metrics, picking metrics that are too general, ignoring the skew in the data, focusing on the average rather than worst case, and a host of other mistakes.
[03:38:44] <maks25> ic
[03:39:48] <PaulWay[w]> You could measure 'average performance time' but that could be heavily biased by your load balancer making a simple 'are you there' call every five seconds.
[03:40:25] <PaulWay[w]> And how do you even find a 'bottleneck'?
[03:41:32] <maks25> A customer complains, I populate the db with a ton of random data and run django-silk on the end point.
[03:41:46] <maks25> Then optimize from there
[03:42:52] <maks25> AS you can probably tell, it's sub optimal. I'd like to identify the issue well before that hah
[03:42:59] <PaulWay[w]> Optimise what?
[03:43:03] <PaulWay[w]> Database speed?
[03:43:08] <PaulWay[w]> Number of requests to the database?
[03:43:18] <PaulWay[w]> Template file fetching?
[03:43:21] <maks25> It depends, it can be a db query, it could be the post processions of the data
[03:43:22] <PaulWay[w]> Serialisation time?
[03:43:54] <maks25> we do a bunch of accounting computations, part in the db, part in pandas as it would be a nightmare to write and maintain in sql
[03:44:35] <PaulWay[w]> I'm not trying to put you off here, I'm just giving you things to consider as you're looking.
[03:44:47] <PaulWay[w]> Try to focus on the thing that's causing the most delay.
[03:45:06] <PaulWay[w]> And don't be afraid to push out to other teams and say "your system is causing this slowdown".
[03:45:07] <maks25> Oh, I am not taking it that way at all. I appreciate constructive criticism.
[03:45:22] <maks25> I am the other team :)
[03:45:33] <maks25> I am a 1 man show that is doing the work of 5

[12:48:02] <oaken-so1rce> Hi, I'm using a django application that makes heavy use of the admin interface, and one of the date fields uses a date picker as input that stubbornly refuses to display dates in any format other than m/d/y. I'm not an expert in django, so I don't really know what determines these formats. I've tried a couple of things, but without success. any tips? thanks

I've started down this path a number of times over the years...I've been through the Django tutorial at least 4 times, but it's been a few years. Is there a book you could recommend for coming up to speed quickly? I have deep experience in Rails if that helps
[19:20:31] <d1rewolf> i'm not sure the tutorial is the best place to start (again), but if that's what you recommend, I'll go that path

[19:29:39] <moldy> and then just start working on a project
[19:30:14] <moldy> regarding books, https://www.feldroy.com/books/two-scoops-of-django-3-x is probably the only one that is not rather outdated
