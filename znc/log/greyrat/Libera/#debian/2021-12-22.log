[03:39:24] <jelly> bind tries to do too much.  I like pdns-server.
[03:40:40] <jelly> dns needs to be reliable.  You might as well run different software on your two auth servers, and see how well both work.

[03:41:07] <greycat> bind has a long history of security holes
[03:42:57] <jelly> everything has a history of security holes.  ISC software however also has a history of inadequate security coding practices.  Also, bind does so much and often some obscure feature that you never needed, or knew it was enabled by default, has a security issue.
[03:43:41] <Khepra> I think it's pretty secure out of the box.
[03:44:15] <jelly> it's pretty dumb out of the box and allows you to use it as both auth and recursor.

[03:44:32] <Khepra> I run a number of authoritative DNS servers for several hundred zones. like Jelly said, everything has a vuln. I see more CVEs coming down from Apache than Bind, in a typical. year.
[03:44:57] <jelly> I didn't know apache had an auth dns server.
[03:45:03] <jkc> Apache also has a much larger attack surface, and isn't a DNS server.
[03:45:08] <Khepra> jelly: no it doesn't. it's limited to localnets as recursor unless you allow something else.
[03:45:29] * Khepra shrugs.
[03:45:48] <jelly> Khepra, so yeah, it _does_ recursion by default.
[03:46:43] <Khepra> limited to localnets
[03:47:04] <pushrad> ask three people, get four answers huh
[03:47:16] <Khepra> its' a bigass tool with lots of knobs. serves the purpose well. is there a better one? shrug.
[03:47:43] <Khepra> most certainly, however, I'd stick to : don't run a public resolver in any kind using _any_ software.
[03:47:53] <jelly> I've learned to avoid tools that try to do too much
[03:48:00] <Khepra> DNS requires UDP support for small requests and can be abused extremely easily
[03:48:44] <Khepra> surely there's tons of freeware, freemium and paid "censorship mitigating" DNS services

[17:50:49] <Khepra> silly: given the sudo nonsense Aarch was given earler, I wouldn't be surprised there's root's instances running
[17:50:51] <Aarch64debian> u mean from vnc?
[17:51:01] <silly> oic
[17:51:20] <Aarch64debian> let me see
[17:51:21] <Khepra> Aarch64debian: I mean, you installed x11vnc package, and that installs x11vnc.desktop launcher, meaning you should be able to clicky-clicky start teh application in your DE and even make it autostart
[17:52:09] <Khepra> Aarch64debian: try to use the packages with their default settings as much as possible and deviate as little as possible to obtain a goal. your future self will thank you for that.
[17:52:35] <Khepra> so what I mean here is, check if the default packaged launcher works too, and if it does, see if you can make it "autostart" with your DE autostart settings.
[17:53:15] <Khepra> which then brings up one question: would this work if you wanted rpi to be boot-to-vnc straight with zero interactivity. I would say No, as this way requires DE login, so you'd have to turn it into a "user service"

[22:53:44] <red-bear> hello all, I am running a cluster of 4 raspberry pi 4s, Ihave most current raspbian installed, but cannot get snap to work, and trying to install microk8s but can't make it work, what am I doing wrong? Apt-get works fine

[22:55:02] <Khepra> oh I just noticed it actually renamed to "Raspberry Pi OS". Neat. "raspbian" was too nerdy.
[22:55:33] <sussudio> you should go see a doctor if you have raspberry piss.

[23:00:31] <red-bear> all the sources online I find for pi-cluster talk about kubernetes, or sometimes ansible
[23:00:58] <Khepra> xx: maybe macdonalds is complaining. in the tech sector, at least from what I see, there's absolutely no shortage. unless you're not willing to pay for skill and knowledge
