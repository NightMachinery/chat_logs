[08:41:05] <pystardust> yo
[09:02:10] <gtlsgamr> hey
[09:17:24] <Arya[m]> hi
[10:06:55] <pystardust> any one doing competitive programing these days?
[10:06:57] <gtlsgamr> What is an easy way to search through a ttf file?
[10:07:20] <Arya[m]> gtlsgamr: font-preview-ueberzug 
[10:08:04] <gtlsgamr> Not that way
[10:08:11] <gtlsgamr> I have a ttf with 5k+ icons.
[10:08:15] <gtlsgamr> I need to search through them
[10:08:26] <Arya[m]> maybe the gnome font-previewer
[10:08:30] <Arya[m]> i forgot its name
[10:11:22] <pystardust> gtlsgamr: I don't think the icons are associated with a name, they usually are stored just like every other character. So if you pick a icon online and copy its character value then ur font will render it
[10:19:49] <gtlsgamr> Yep

[14:05:08] <mysticbtw[m]> Hey bugswriter: You should check out some cli (ncurses) torrent client 
[14:07:02] <mysticbtw[m]> Personally i use tremc (transmission-remote-cli) and its so low on resource that,
[14:07:02] <mysticbtw[m]> I seed whole time when i use laptop.
[14:07:02] <mysticbtw[m]> It just takes about 30-40 mb thats it
[14:08:14] * mysticbtw[m] uploaded an image: (38KiB) < https://libera.ems.host/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/XGHlxNUlgkrkFHgWEldXsbYx/Tue%20Oct%2019%2004%3A07%3A23%20PM%20IST%202021.png >
[14:08:37] <mysticbtw[m]> This is the stats from it.
[14:08:37] <mysticbtw[m]> And you can imagine how great it is todo on laptop
[14:10:55] <mysticbtw[m]> Wait a sec.... You used deluge, it should have Tui client itself.
[14:10:55] <mysticbtw[m]> How is it compared to Transmission?
[14:11:12] <mysticbtw[m]> Sorry to jump to conclusion very quick
[14:11:39] <mysticbtw[m]> * 30-40 mb for daemon+tremc thats it
[14:13:46] <pystardust> mysticbtw[m]: bugswriter is not in this group, the bridge is removed, he is on telegram
[14:15:15] <pystardust> transmission-remote-cli is super cool, it gives so much control to the user. transmission-daemon + transmission-remote is what I use. tranmission-daemon also opens up a webinterface (if you want gui)
[14:17:49] <mysticbtw[m]> Yep. So great
[14:17:49] <mysticbtw[m]> Just like your scripts are great bro.
[14:17:49] <mysticbtw[m]> I use ytfzf and rss as my daily content watch
[14:18:52] <mysticbtw[m]> pystardust: Also, the config is straight to the point.
[14:18:52] <mysticbtw[m]> Nothing unnecessary
[14:19:30] <pystardust> :D
[14:20:08] <mysticbtw[m]> Are there many south indian here?
[14:20:26] <pystardust> me!
[14:20:36] <mysticbtw[m]> Cause tamilmv will be gem to them.
