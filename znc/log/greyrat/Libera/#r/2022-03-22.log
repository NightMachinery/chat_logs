[19:13:30] <confuzeus> ns12: there are a few more base R readings at help.start() from your console (e.g. R data import and export,...).

[19:27:39] <confuzeus> it is very similar to advanced R but is more R programming oriented. so, i suppose it is better for someone with a programming background.
[19:28:29] <confuzeus> i bought hard copies of both books (hadley's first version which was before tidyverse).

[19:29:20] <ns12> Bayes: "it's impressive you got thru the introduction to R, it's such a dry reading gah" - I made several attempts 😆 I come from Lisp (Scheme and Common Lisp), Python, and OCaml. I have an amateur interest in statistics.
[19:29:41] <Bayes> ns12 well congrats friend ^_^ it's really great to have you here

[19:31:21] <Bayes> R is very lispy, many of the old school R people were lispers or heavily influenced by lisp
[19:31:49] <Bayes> that said, the "everything is a function" stills needs to click on me

[19:32:52] <confuzeus> true. xlispstat was once a thing. but the author joined the R bandwagon
[19:33:21] <ns12> Bayes: Yes, I think R is a bit weird. The biggest issue I currently have is with the documentation. "The R Language Definition" is not complete. It has a "FIXME" and some bits that appear to be the author's notes.
[19:33:46] <Bayes> well I mean that's R for you ns12, R feels a lot like a WIP
[19:33:58] <Bayes> and not just a WIP, but as a thing in continuous change
[19:34:29] <Bayes> with time you'll find many inconsistencies in the base R language, e.g., naming conventions
[19:35:13] <Bayes> it can be a bit... irking sometimes
[19:35:52] <Bayes> it doesn't help that in the last few years the whole tidyverse as a way to popularize R for data science introduced a kinda different mindset
[19:36:03] <ns12> Bayes: "R feels a lot like a WIP" - Ah, okay. Good to know that this feeling is shared by other R users. I thought that I was missing some important documentation, causing me to feel this way.
[19:37:03] <Bayes> ns12 oh no, it's clearly not you, or at the very least it's us both :D
[19:37:53] <Bayes> not only there are many people introducing their own personality in the same things, but also you have many people introducing different things that over time will pile up
[19:38:29] <Bayes> like, it all started with pairlists (which AFAIK were lisp-like lists but I'm no expert here) then moved to lists, but they had to keep pairlists for compatibility
[19:39:13] <Bayes> same with princomp vs prcomp, wut
[19:40:35] <Bayes> then you have stuff like... print.classname for S3 generics but the odd printCoefmat, summary.classname and summaryRProf, etc
[19:41:18] <Bayes> not to mention that as.Date because Date is not date (o_O) !
[19:42:34] <Bayes> and I can't remember an example top off my head but I think i've found a few more inconsistencies like... many base functions being snake_case but some being camelCase or vice versa
[19:43:05] <Bayes> aaaaaaand finally, so I can move on from my rant and work on my own shit
[19:43:39] <Bayes> the R way of things is to basically provide some rather minimal base R and a plethora of tools to extend R so the community can do it via packages
[19:43:45] <Bayes> so you end up with lots of dependencies
[19:44:10] <Bayes> compare to, say, some languages that like to grow the base language over time to include more and more features
[19:44:18] <Bayes> that's very personal, so you may like that approach or not
[19:44:35] <ns12> Bayes: I don't mind this approach.
[19:45:05] <ns12> My statistical knowledge is not yet large enough to require tons of dependencies, so I'll stick with what the base installation has to offer.
[19:45:38] <Bayes> the only issue I had is that... well, you'll find many inconsistencies among packages so not everything interoperates well and more irking you gotta get used to filling the gap
[19:46:10] <Bayes> I think that's one key thing that made the tidyverse so popular, it helped integrate many different packages into the same framework
[19:46:38] <Bayes> offering some consistency that speeds up learning and programming time quite significantly
[19:47:18] <Bayes> anyway, keep learning ns12 and ask around
[19:47:43] <ns12> Thank you for all the information, Bayes.
[19:48:16] <Bayes> no worries, as all in this world it's highly opinionated so take it with a grain of salt ^_^
[20:07:46] <danshearer> I set up an R/shiny server from scratch, and I there are many things familiar to me from the worlds of other package repositories - CPAN, CTAN, PyPI, npm and more. 
[20:07:49] <danshearer> R is impressive, however a lot of people will find the need to build packages in a C++ environment quite strange, and the same mechanism installs from CRAN as from a random source repository without a word of advice or complaint about the giant footgun :-)
[20:08:26] <danshearer> so n12 do persevere. 
[20:09:09] <danshearer> There are companies who use R a lot, and if just two or three of them could employ a CRAN gardener and infrastructure developer it would make a big difference.
