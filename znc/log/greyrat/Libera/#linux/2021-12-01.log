A concern I have is that the backup starts while things are in the process of changing. Say, the backup would wind up with a file that was "partly" updated.
[00:26:53] <elderK> How can I avoid this? I've looked into rsync, rsnapshot and LVM snapshots. Googled solutions seem not to focus on this issue.
[00:26:53] <elderK> I've thought of bringing the system down automatically around the "snapshot" period but that seems less than ideal too, since I could interrupt something that is in progress.

[02:16:33] <ayecee> what is it counting then

[02:16:55] <Dagmar> It knows what it's designed capacity is, what the discharge graph over time should look like, and it's strictly a measurement of voltage
[02:17:10] <ayecee> no, for sure it's not a measurement of voltage.
[02:17:55] <Dagmar> For smart batteries it is.  You don't have to guess about the remaining power when you know what the cells are designed to hold, know you have a specific number of them, and know the high- and low-water marks for charging

[02:19:28] <ayecee> going by voltage wouldn't be practical. it varies so much with temperature and load.
[02:19:34] <Dagmar> Yeah but when it comes back online from being off for some time, it's going to start with a guess based on voltage
[02:19:45] <ayecee> also the lithium ion voltage curve is very shallow.
[02:20:08] <pierino> capacity is not in Ah ?
[02:20:23] <Dagmar> ...or it'll just report the same figure as before and then people get the supe-fun surprise of watching the battery go from 95% down to 20% in a short span of minutes
[02:20:47] <ayecee> pierino: for better or worse, it's usually given in Wh for these batteries.

[02:21:32] <Dagmar> Smart batteries updating their "map" of what the charge/flow is the reason it's recommended to let them do a full discharge cycle every so often
[02:21:56] <ayecee> sure, because of the self-discharge that throws off the coulumb counting over time.
[02:22:17] <ayecee> and also the progressive loss of capacity, i guess.

[10:10:05] <pnbeast> grouinos, good news:  LFS exists.  Or you can spend a few years learning Linux and, probably, OS theory, coding in C and a couple of other languages, reading long books and practicing until you can do it yourself.
[10:10:08] <xx> grouinos: you're setting yourself up for a lot of needless extra work if you do everything yourself
[10:10:36] <rindolf> a|3x: hi
[10:10:38] <xx> and perhaps more importantly, nobody will ever be able to replicate your problems, because nobody will have the same environment as you

[10:17:27] <[ESphynx]> so I tried creating a RAID0 array with mdadm, and it seemed to work, I had created a partition table and file system and everything, but after a reboot the array was gone...

[10:17:50] <[ESphynx]> and now trying to do mdadm --create gives me a Device or resource busy  and not suitable for this array

[11:20:28] <tirnanog> [ESphynx]: your initramfs, in all likelihood. only a 0.90 superblock can be automatically assembled by the kernel. if the initramfs doesn't do so, it's also possible for arrays to be incrementally assembled in response to udev rules processing udevents for the underlying block devices.
[11:20:30] <catbeard> you'd probably want to `grub-install /dev/md0` too
[11:20:48] *** Quits: Betal (~Betal@user/betal) (Quit: WeeChat 3.3)
[11:21:01] <tirnanog> by the way, if there were things on these block devices before, you should sanitise them with wipefs (note, it only reports signatures unless given the -a option).
[11:21:08] *** Joins: gschanuel2 (~gschanuel@user/gschanuel)
[11:21:26] <tirnanog> again, to make sure there's no metadata left that could result in confusion as to its purpose.
[11:21:49] <tirnanog> if it's done right, it should only report a raid superblock and absolutely nothing else.
[11:21:53] <catbeard> tirnanog: wouldn't the --zero-superblock in the blogspot article take care of that?
[11:22:23] <tirnanog> catbeard: it only does what it says, zeroes a raid superblock, if present. wipefs -a obliterates any detectable signatures - literally anything that libblkid recognises, which is a lot.
[11:22:35] <tirnanog> partition tables, ext4 filesystem signatures ... you name it.
[11:22:41] <catbeard> gotcha
[11:22:55] <catbeard> i've never had to do wipefs personally
[11:23:01] <tirnanog> it doesn't come up often, but I have actually seen one or two cases come up where it stops something from working as expected.
[11:23:10] <tirnanog> besides, it's just common sense to eradicate any residual signatures.
[11:23:17] <catbeard> but then i've only set it up on brand new drives without anything on it
[11:23:25] <tirnanog> ah. yeah, nothing to worry about in that case.

[11:24:34] <tirnanog> that is, if you create a partition in which it then finds signatures of any kind, it now prompts as to whether they should be deleted.
[11:24:43] <[ESphynx]> catbeard: so if I do mdadm --stop --scan ; mdadm --assemble --scan
[11:24:47] <[ESphynx]> should that bring the array back?
[11:24:51] <tirnanog> sometimes, that's right but it's also pretty bad if the intention was just to create a partition in the same place deliberately.
[11:25:26] <tirnanog> [ESphynx]: not sure why --scan is mixed with --stop there but yes, it should.

[11:34:53] <tirnanog> [ESphynx]: possible explanation: the hostname is not set at the point that the array is being composed by initramfs code. in that case, it would be considered as foreign and given a high minor number.
[11:35:01] <tirnanog> there is ... oh well.
[11:35:13] <tirnanog> I suppose it doesn't matter all that much anyway.
[11:35:49] <ESphynx> tirnanog: yeah even after leaving that line in mdadm.conf for /0, it goes back to 127

[12:25:36] <DPA> I have a nodejs project which needs kerberos, and has to run on kubernetes. So it needs /etc/krb5.keytab. But I absolutely have to put it in vault, because it contains secrets.
[12:25:36] <DPA> I first thought I could make a fuse fs so I can symlink a file to a kv entry in vault, but kubernetes doesn't cleanly support fuse yet, so that won't work.
[12:25:36] <DPA> With libkrb5, (which the node kerberos module relies on), Is there some way to avoid the keytab, or to set it using an environment variable, or something like that?

[22:13:16] <peetaur> grkblood13: there are gui things that alert you when things are plugged in... but they should list the filesystems, not just the whole drives. I guess you mean that?
[22:13:24] <theos> peetaur i have done a lot of changes like that to reduce boot times. disabled a lot of kernel modules(?) i didnt need. followed a guide some time back. 45sec is the min i could get. i dont like systemd but cant get rid of it that easily without moving to another OS. things are ok now :) hoping the ssd would make things even better.
[22:13:50] <grkblood13> lsblk just lists the drive name for example

[22:45:51] <ayecee> not without seeing the error message, for sure
[22:45:51] <hexnewbie> I think sshfs uses sftp, and sftp implements POSIX-like calls over the wire, so whatever you can do on a local filesystem, you should be able to do on a remote. That would *exclude* swap, mount, loop, etc., but you can use fuse2fs to the horror of everyone in this channel

[23:28:28] <wingone> Hello -- I have a question-- I have installed Ubuntu18.04 via a Vagrantfile.  I then install Ubuntu Desktop with "sudo tasksel install ubuntu-desktop" or "sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop".  Then I shutdown the VM and start it in VirtualBox.  Here is the outcome-- (Sometimes my shared directory is duplicated) I receive this error message about giving privileges to Nautilus.  -- https://ibb.co/hdKGYk1

[23:29:06] <wingone> I would expect the vagrant user to have access to nautilus.. I guess the solution is some sort of permissions modification
[23:29:41] <wingone> Just weird that the dock & file system don't show up
[23:29:46] <wingone> after I installed desktop...

[23:35:22] <frojnd> Why when listing gpg keys I see only one ultimate id, but if I edit that key I see 2 ultimate ids? I've revoked one ultimate id but I still see it when I edit gpg key?
