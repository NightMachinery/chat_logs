[04:32:40] <pjb> thovthe: this is a legal form, so it should work.
[04:33:23] <pjb> thovthe: it's difficult to say whether it's wrong, if you don't give a specification.  A program without a specification is always 100% correct: it does what it does.

[09:14:47] <MetaYan> pjb: Thanks for "it does what it does". Still laughing.
[09:15:32] <pjb> Well, it's not a joke.
[09:16:10] <pjb> This is why there's a docstring to defun (and others).  To write down some kind of specification.
[09:16:46] <MetaYan> Good point.
[09:16:47] <pjb> This is particularly important in lisp, because it's a very orthogonal language, and there are very few sexps that are not valid forms.
[09:17:25] <pjb> And there are a lot of valid forms that can generate errors at run-time, which may be expected and handled, so we cannot assume that it's unwanted.
