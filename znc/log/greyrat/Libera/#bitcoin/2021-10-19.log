[00:04:26] <gene> berndj: not sure I understand you. are you saying if Blockstream or Chaincode Labs was found to have too much influence, no one would use their code?
[00:05:15] <berndj> gene, no, i'm saying that if they flipped the evil bit and changed the code to confiscate your coins, people would stop using their code
[00:05:49] <gene> if so, I would argue the opposite: if any individual (or group of) organization(s) had overwhelming influence, they would have the ability to run propaganda campaigns
[00:06:08] <Guest73> s17 I'm interested in finding nonce (k) in a transaction
[00:06:14] <berndj> why would they only have that ability then?
[00:06:48] <gene> right, but how many people use alternatives to Google, even though they have an arguably central (singular) role in browser development?
[00:06:54] <berndj> gene, CSW had approximately zero influence on the protocol, yet had the ability to run propaganda campaigns
[00:07:02] <s17> I think nonce is only for the block, when finding the hash
[00:07:19] <JPT> According to https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Block_hashing_algorithm the block header contains the nonce
[00:07:22] <gene> berndj: that's categorically different than billion dollar corporations

[00:08:47] <berndj> gene, maybe so, but you're creating a dependence where there is none. a billion dollar corporation can run propaganda campaigns whether they have influence over the protocol or not
[00:08:48] <gene> what I'm getting at is that socially, Bitcoin development is not immune to centralising forces present in other industries. to ignore that fact is dangerous
[00:08:52] <Guest73> JPT the block does, but where is in the transaction (in the signature somewhere)
[00:09:26] <Guest73> gene watch out before they censor you
[00:09:57] <berndj> gene, i see decentralization as a means to an end, not an end in itself
[00:10:01] <JPT> I don't think a transaction contains a nonce. I never needed one when creating and signing transactions with coinb.in?
[00:10:35] <gene> berndj: yes anyone can run propaganda campaigns at any time, organizations with control (undue influence) over the channels considered legitimate (magazines, github repos, other media outlets)
[00:10:48] <berndj> like so what if satoshi came back and reassumed sole authorship of bitcoin? how does that affect us?
[00:11:02] <JPT> Also, the wiki page for transactions has only a few matches for Nonce right where it talks about Generations and extraNonce in relation to the block header
[00:11:03] <Guest73> every transaction must have a (k) nonce and each must be random
[00:11:28] <gene> then Satoshi could be squeezed by anti-Bitcoin interests, and fuck up the project

[00:12:57] <JPT> However, there is no mention of a nonce in there, apart from the coinbase extra nonce

[00:14:24] <Guest73> JPT that also not good
[00:14:30] <berndj> gene, i'm not convinced it matters how centralized (or not) bitcoin development is. the rational response is the same: invest in auditing the code
[00:14:43] <JPT> Guest73: Where did you get the information that a transaction must contain a nonce?
[00:14:55] <Guest73> Lol
[00:15:00] <Guest73> ECDSA
[00:15:09] <JPT> lol?
[00:15:35] <Guest73> yeah lol
[00:15:44] <gene> berndj: then we will just have to agree to disagree. if you don't see the dangers associated with centralisation in a protocol like Bitcoin, we have fundamentally different understandings of the game theory and social aspects of the protocol
[00:15:52] <JPT> Dude, there is a fundamental difference between parsing a bitcoin transaction and parsing an ecdsa signature.
[00:16:20] <JPT> You don't look through the bitcoin wiki for that

[00:18:36] <Guest73> Repeated R is all about the nonce which is the same for multiple transactions. I want just one nonce from the signature probably need to know the position in DER
[00:19:01] <belcher> gene read this article, it tries to explain bitcoin core's low requirement for trust https://blog.lopp.net/who-controls-bitcoin-core-/
[00:19:51] <belcher> fundamentally it comes down to what berndj said: its open source and relies on you examining the source code
[00:20:25] <belcher> the protocol isnt really centralized, the protocol is running on many thousands of full nodes out there
[00:20:25] <Guest73> The scammer belcher linking to the other scammer lopp, nice. Coinjoin and wasabi sucks bro
[00:20:53] <belcher> zoltan?
[00:21:05] <JPT> Let's see... each input should have a signature within the signature script bytes. That's where you can expect signatures for each input used. Not sure about their format yet, but if they contain a nonce, you could get them out of there.
[00:21:31] <davidbak> you guys talking about the "social aspects of the protocol" and the impact of mighty corporations over Bitcoin _development_: consider instead the social aspects of the protocol and the impact of might corporations over Bitcoin deployment, use, and _legality_:  The enormous financial institutions of all countries, banks, investment funds, _exchanges_ which must operate with the blessing of the local government, and all their ties
[00:21:31] <davidbak> to the mechanisms of government.  Someone "taking over" _development_ of Bitcoin ranks way low in the threats to Bitcoin, IMO.
[00:21:35] <berndj> gene, our actions shouldn't depend on how centralized (or not) software or protocol development is
[00:21:45] <physiology> I that is the truly revolutionary aspect: the mechanisms of the currency are available for audit by all who understand the technology.  Not so with typical fiat.
[00:21:45] <Guest73> wow someone flooding...
[00:21:53] <berndj> that's nothing at all like "not seeing the dangers associated with centralisation"
[00:23:33] <Guest73> centralized development always result in centralized products!
[00:24:01] <gene> belcher: I've read the article, and am not fully convinced by Lopp's arguments. entire avenues of development have been left to bitrot in the core repo, only to be later implemented by core developers. careers can be made or broken based on the amount of merit one accrues in this space. to deny that there are gatekeepers in a meritocratic community leaves out an important aspect to a healthy,
[00:24:03] <gene> resilient culture
[00:24:48] <belcher> who are the gatekeepers?
[00:24:58] <berndj> perhaps, but even if development were completely atomized, 100% "decentralized", it shouldn't give us licence to trust the code any more than if ever bitcoin core dev were an employee of microsoft itself
[00:25:06] <Guest73> Lopp works for big pharma he will give you some Made in USA pills with the taste of fascism

[03:45:24] <reset[m]> its going up
[03:49:38] <yanmaani1> gene: it seems like you've rediscovered capitalism
[03:49:48] <yanmaani1> at the end of the day, some people are always going to have control over other people
[03:50:26] <yanmaani1> that's just how it is, not really anything to be done about it. you can clear out the obvious power structures, like if github started to act up you could self-host, but beyond that it's very difficult IMO
[03:51:04] <yanmaani1> the other thing you could do would be to encourage altcoins, or sidechains if that's your cup of tea, and then have them be a sort of proving ground for ideas.
