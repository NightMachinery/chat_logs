[06:02:04] <maroon> re101-camel-1, i dont understand what you're saying, does your page include things that should and shouldnt match?
[06:03:27] <re101-camel-1> i see my link does not show what i entered
[06:03:27] <re101-camel-1> i am not sure how to remedy that
[06:04:19] <maroon> among the test strings, or the search pattern or both?
[06:04:51] <re101-camel-1> both
[06:05:14] <re101-camel-1> the link shows the orig patterns / strings from a stack overflow question
[06:05:22] <re101-camel-1> but not what i entered
[06:06:05] <re101-camel-1> let me try entering one from scratch
[06:08:28] <re101-camel-1> ok here is the link https://regex101.com/r/WpPYkb/1
[06:13:44] <maroon> so the dealbreaker is that it shouldnt match when it's preceded by 'slow'?
[06:13:52] <re101-camel-1> correct
[06:14:05] <re101-camel-1> thank you for looking at it
[06:16:23] <maroon> is it ok if i cheat by putting the ^ at the very beginning of the pattern?
[06:16:36] <maroon> or is it allowed to have the pattern match in the middle of a line?
[06:16:48] <re101-camel-1> middle of line
[06:19:05] <re101-camel-1> the database column on which it will be matching is varchar(max)
[06:19:06] <re101-camel-1> and there could be multiple matches in the text
[06:24:31] <maroon> where you have Laptop? is it intential that the match is Lapto or Laptop ?
[06:25:03] <re101-camel-1> that's a typo on my part

[19:30:59] <re101-pug-4458> thank you, I know it is weird but does it include numbers and things like special characters? because it is username but it is written as name

[19:34:03] <re101-pug-4458> it worked, if instead of Name= it was <img alt= can I just change the expression?
[19:34:29] <karhunkynsi> Sure, try it.
[19:35:43] <karhunkynsi> If some of them has more attributes or whatever it won't match those though.

[19:39:38] <re101-pug-4458> Nope, Im totally a noob when it comes to coding, It took me ages to find a solution to this problem. Changing the timeout on regex 101 seemed to work tho!
[19:40:25] <karhunkynsi> Ok, good.
[19:40:31] <re101-pug-4458> Is there any way to transform the match information to only display the "Group" and not the "Match"?

[19:42:10] <karhunkynsi> In the LIST window it only shows the name values.
[19:42:49] <re101-pug-4458> Oh, nevermind, I found it. On the right side it gives both group and match, but below it shows only the matches

[22:27:14] <karhunkynsi> You don't. Regex doesn't do arithmetic.
[22:41:50] <purplex> why do you need to add them, re101-guppy-52 probably you're solving it wrong way.
[22:42:34] <re101-guppy-52> yes I was trying to do it all at once but I can handle the math after I get the times.
[22:50:49] <purplex> always break it up what you solve! it lets you see the reality of the thing you are solving. alright brb
