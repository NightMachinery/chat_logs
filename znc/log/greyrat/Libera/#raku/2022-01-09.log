[00:05:39] <jdv> does anyone know if https://github.com/CurtTilmes/raku-nativehelpers-callback/pull/3 is good?
[00:05:51] <jdv> seems it but i have very little experience

[00:35:00] <SmokeMachine> Voldenet: about the `#1.a` stuff, I'm planing on transforming something like this (https://github.com/FCO/EventExpressionLanguage/blob/master/examples/fire-risk) into something like this:  https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/Twx0KKt5/
[00:38:02] <Voldenet> it is slightly more verbose
[00:39:22] *** Joins: reportable6 (rep-able@2001:41d0:2:5eb5::)
[00:39:31] <Voldenet> in fact I think that assigning fields should be separate from matching rules
[00:40:22] <SmokeMachine> Voldenet: yes, and I'd prefere to find a way to "declare" on the has declaration from where to get its value instead of actively setting it... but I couldn't find a syntactic way of doing that...
[00:40:57] <SmokeMachine> Voldenet: I agree... any suggestion?
[00:42:02] *** Joins: abraxxa-home (~alex@2a01:100:2000:2500::22)
[00:44:26] <Voldenet> maybe convention-based constructors/setters like `event fire-risk { multi method new(Temperature $t) {  } multi method new(Humidity $t) { } }``
[00:45:38] *** Quits: abraxxa-home (~alex@2a01:100:2000:2500::22) (Remote host closed the connection)
[00:45:50] <Voldenet> and `multi method new(Temperature $t, Humidity $h) { }`
[00:46:48] <Voldenet> but i'm not sure how would that be optimized, because matching everything would require creating cartesian product of all event types from last 5 minutes
[00:48:23] <SmokeMachine> Voldenet: I didn't get how the matching would work on that case...
[00:49:43] <SmokeMachine> Voldenet: have you seen my try to explain how the matching works currently? https://github.com/FCO/EventExpressionLanguage#how-it-work

[00:55:21] <Voldenet> …so essentially it means that every event match generates some NFA
[00:55:56] <SmokeMachine> It converts the pattern into a tree of conditions and sub steps, then it adds the root condition of the pattern into a condition btree, every event is tested on the tree of conditions (its a tree so it do not need to test all conditions), then, when a event matches with any of the conditions of the btree it gets the next step of that condition and adds it to the btree...
[00:58:38] <Voldenet> it somehow sounds like multi dispatch
[00:59:22] <Voldenet> and `event` object that exposes abstract state machine that consumes events
[01:03:54] <SmokeMachine> yes... originally on that repo's version I was thinking on a process that would parse a string code, consume events from log file, kinesis, kafka, etc and use a external query storage (probably a DB)... but now I'm thinking to make a lib using events defined by raku code (instead of string to be parsed) to consume a Supply of events using a in memory query storage...
[01:03:57] <Voldenet> I understand why TOP method is used and it's sane
[01:08:24] <Voldenet> maybe it would be more practical to define trait to link events
[01:24:14] <Voldenet> `event fire-risk { has $.temperature is event(*.temperature.value); has $.humidity is event(*.humidity.value); has $.area is event-match(*.temperature.area ~~ *.humidity.area); }`
[01:51:06] <SmokeMachine> But if we have more than one temperature, how to choose?

[02:38:38] <Voldenet> maybe in case of multiple temperatures just *.temperature[0] or *.temperature.grep(…)
[02:39:25] <Voldenet> in fact, not accepting multiple events of the same type is valid too
[02:40:12] <Voldenet> consider this `event temperature { … }; event previous-temperature { has $.temperature(*.temperature); }; event fire-risk { has $.temperature is event(*.previous-temperature) }}`

[03:12:49] <andrea[m]> if i want to pass an argument to an one line function but i don't care about the name of the argument, is this the best way to express that?: sub mysub($_) { .say }
[03:13:13] <andrea[m]> i mean, the $_ works as expected but it that something "correct"
