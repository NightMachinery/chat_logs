[00:05:06] <Mochomo> Hi everyone. I have been using ffmpeg to download video streams once they finished. If I use this command "ffmpeg -i URL -map 0:15 -c copy name.mp4" while the stream is "LIVE" am I going to download from very beginning of the stream or from the moment I sent ffmpeg command?
[00:06:01] <Mochomo> Let's say LIVE show started 30 minutes ago I sent download command at minute 31... Am i going to download the first 30 minutes as well?

[00:27:29] <BtbN> That's impossible to tell from just that, and will mostly depen on what URL actually is
[00:27:37] <BtbN> if URL sends you the stream from the beginning, it sure will
[00:27:42] <BtbN> if it's just a live feed, nope
[00:28:49] <Mochomo> I can go back to the begging using the progress bar.. But it opens on LIVE mode.

[00:52:32] <tar_xvf> Mochomo: you should give it a try and let us know how it goes.
[00:52:50] <tar_xvf> however, be careful that the url you are referring to is the direct-link to the live stream instead of just to a page which shows it
[00:53:08] <tar_xvf> you may also want to give youtube-dl a try for that purpose

[01:00:28] <BtbN> Mochomo, you still have not shared any further info, so your question remains unanswerable
[01:00:36] <BtbN> is it rtmp, hls, plain http, ...
[01:01:00] <Mochomo> Should I paste URL here?
[01:01:12] <BtbN> Or just tell us what it is
[01:01:34] <Mochomo> URL starts with https..... Not sure if that what you mean?
[01:01:38] *** Quits: arbitercoin (~Rheanna@218.78.67.149) (Remote host closed the connection)
[01:01:47] <BtbN> So either plain http or hls, most likely
[01:01:58] <tar_xvf> ok, wonder if that happens to coincide with the legal threads by youtube a short time ago. Do you know if it's being forked by anyone?
[01:01:59] <BtbN> What does ffmpeg say it is?
[01:02:12] <Mochomo> How can I check?
[01:02:19] <BtbN> Look at what it says about the stream
[01:02:20] <tar_xvf> `ffprobe <url>`
[01:02:21] <BtbN> quite literally

[02:12:46] <jtgd> CounterPillow Wow, I never thought of that. But this is a subtitle stream that is in the same original file as the video, not something I downloaded. I will see if there's a way to check for that.
[02:13:05] <jtgd> CounterPillow But wouldn't the video then actually play for that long?
[02:14:06] <CounterPillow> hmmm, if you're hardsubbing then I guess yeah that would make it play that long, so that theory is out the window. I only know that similar issues have happened before with soft subtitles

[10:56:05] <JEEB> nemesit: you want `ffprobe -of json -show_frames -i INPUT` or so. JSON or so into stdout.
[10:56:22] <JEEB> if you are OK with just packet timestamps (no decoding), -show_packets instead
[10:56:24] <nemesit> but I want the frame extracted
[10:56:26] *** Joins: thebombzen (~thebombze@c-68-41-54-207.hsd1.mi.comcast.net)
[10:56:33] <JEEB> "extracted"?
[10:56:39] <nemesit> like I want the first I-frame at a certain time
[10:56:46] <nemesit> output into an image
[10:56:55] <nemesit> and get the timestamp of that frame
[10:57:29] <nemesit> with select scene I can use metadata=print to get the time offset to stdout
[10:59:18] <JEEB> I think the best alternative is for you to patch ffmpeg.c (or your own API client) to write the data you need how you need it. or you keep the input timestamp as-is and write that one image in a container to stdout. then read that container with whatever you need
[10:59:40] <JEEB> alternatively, if you are doing image output, see the image2 writer's frame_pts option
[10:59:49] <JEEB> which writes the frame PTS as time
[10:59:55] <JEEB> asdf not time
[10:59:58] <JEEB> as file name :P
[11:00:09] <nemesit> that would be nice
[11:00:42] <JEEB> -h muxer=image2 should show that option
[11:00:57] <JEEB> if you are using that (see the extensions list)
[11:02:10] <nemesit> I think when I tried the frame_pts option I got an index or something

[11:06:05] <JEEB> so 1000 is one second etc
[11:07:18] <nemesit> hm
[11:07:20] <nemesit> interesting
[11:07:51] <nemesit> JEEB do you happen to know why strftime %L is not supported?
[11:08:54] <JEEB> looking at the code it just calls strftime on your system
[11:09:08] <JEEB> so if it doesn't work, then your system does not support %L ?
[11:09:26] <JEEB> > !strftime(filename, sizeof(filename), img->path, tm)
[11:10:35] <nemesit> hm
[11:11:01] <JEEB> also I don't see it listed in various documentation pages for the C language
[11:16:12] <nemesit> yeah I'm using it from a ruby script

[11:24:55] <JEEB> nemesit: if it's the PTS you're interested in, get the PTS and set the time base when calling ffmpeg.c
[11:25:06] <JEEB> then divide by time base when you get to that point
[11:25:11] <JEEB> and you get time in seconds
[11:27:00] <nemesit> ffmpeg -ss 12763ms -t 60 -i input_23.976.mp4  -f image2 -vf 'select=eq(pict_type\,PICT_TYPE_I),showinfo' -frames:v 1  -time_base:v 1:1000  -frame_pts 1 xyz_%09d_out.jpg
[11:27:09] <nemesit> I get only zeroes in the filename
[11:28:06] <JEEB> -vsync passthrough -copyts do the same?
[11:28:27] <JEEB> there is also an option to limit start time to zero, so let me see that one too
[11:29:19] <JEEB> -avoid_negative_ts disabled
[11:29:26] <JEEB> I think that's it?
[11:29:36] <JEEB> but utilize the minimum that gives you the right result
[11:29:41] <nemesit> with -vsync passthrough -copyts I get the ms
[11:29:46] <JEEB> great

[12:53:25] <JEEB> because it's not supposed to be a thing to parse
[12:54:11] <JEEB> if you really want something in stdout, you can utilize something like -f framehash as second output?
[12:54:15] <JEEB> and set that to stdout
[12:54:27] <JEEB> all logging in multimedia applications goes to stderr

[15:04:15] <JEEB> if FFmpeg is built with threads, most components will spawn at least one thread, so you have one thread reading the input, another thread for decoding, another for encoder etc
[15:04:26] <JEEB> -threads 1 will limit decoders and encoders I think

[21:15:09] <emcodem> what's the exact commandline you are using for opening?
[21:17:52] <SamHenderson> A bit more about this terminal though ...  It has two monitors, one is a touch screen and is what the retailer actually uses to sell tickets and print reports.  The second monitor has a chromium browser opened in fullscreen kiosk mode that plays a few hundred different *.webm videos (advertisements) to customers.  My ultimate goal is get this .mp4

[21:57:54] <emcodem> whats interesting is that when you echo'd hello
[21:58:02] <emcodem> it stated that it did read 6 bytes
[21:58:19] <emcodem> when i do this, it says 5 bytes which matches hello
[22:00:40] <emcodem> are you able to confirm that it states it reads e.g. 2 bytes when you specify a file of 1 byte size?
[22:04:48] <SamHenderson> Well, I echo'd "1"  into a file called one.txt ... but when I run ls -la it shows the filesize is 2 bytes?
[22:05:03] <furq> newline
[22:05:19] <emcodem> well i guess your echo puts a newline as @furq says
[22:05:26] <emcodem> thats ok then
[22:05:30] <SamHenderson> and it does indeed read 2 bytes
[22:05:33] <furq> shell echo always does]
[22:05:41] <SamHenderson> Good to know :)
[22:05:54] <emcodem> funny that it doesnt do on windows hehe

[22:07:00] <emcodem> sorry, ubuntu does, i was in the wrong terminal
[22:07:28] <emcodem> ok so that leads nowhere... wtf could be the issue here?
[22:07:37] <SamHenderson> So ... here's what I did to even get to this point
[22:08:15] <SamHenderson> When I went to compile this demo program from github I found that I was missing avcodec, avformat, etc etc.
[22:11:01] <SamHenderson> This terminal has no package manager, however it (allegedly) was based off Fedora ... so I fired up a Fedora 27 live USB stick (because the GLIBC version there matches the GLIBC version on my terminal) and then I went and installed ffmpeg-devel and copied the /usr/include/ffmpeg and /usr/lib64/libav* and libswscale and libswresample libs over to my
[22:11:01] <SamHenderson> terminals SDK /usr/include and /usr/lib directories ...  This allowed the program to compile and link fine
[22:11:39] <emcodem> my problem is that i don't have enough insight to understand the way you start your stuff
[22:11:40] <emcodem> DISPLAY=:0.0 LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$SDKTARGETSYSROOT/usr/lib ./rdu-video-test.out /data/src/rdu-video-test/bin/x64/Debug/sometext.txt
[22:11:41] <SamHenderson> BUT!  The libav* libs were missing some dependency .so files so I had to copy those from the Fedora 27 machine as well
[22:11:48] <SamHenderson> Ok
[22:12:49] <emcodem> ok but what you just said might tell us enough
[22:13:05] <emcodem> basically you fooled the compiler hehe
[22:13:27] <SamHenderson> Yeah that is kind of what I was afraid of ..
[22:13:51] <emcodem> ah it will not be that hard to solve

[23:02:18] <emcodem> hmmm i just recognize your stuff is c++, not sure how that works together
[23:03:42] <emcodem> but what i did in the past to make my life easy is to e.g. just replace the code of ffmpeg.c with my code so i was able to use all the configure and make scripts from ffmpeg
[23:06:35] <emcodem> maybe this is still doable with a little hack in the makefile? ..others here might know better
[23:11:50] <JEEB> for linker and compiler flags, just utilize pkg-config. you build FFmpeg, set --prefix in configure to a location (generally in your homedir or wherever your development sysroot is at), then make and make install. stuff gets properly installed into the prefix you set. then when you're building your own thing, `PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/path/to/your/prefix/lib/pkgconfig pkg-config --libs libavcodec` for example
[23:12:03] <JEEB> that would give you the linking stuff for libavcodec
[23:12:14] <JEEB> then if you are utilizing libavformat, you put that in there
[23:12:20] <JEEB> for compiler flags there's --cflags
[23:12:41] <JEEB> (you can see the .pc files under lib/pkgconfig in the prefix which actually have that information written down in them)
[23:15:10] <JEEB> if you look at doc/examples/README and other stuff there, it primes you for that stuff (see Makefile.example etc)
