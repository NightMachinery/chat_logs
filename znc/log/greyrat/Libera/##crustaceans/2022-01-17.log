[00:56:59] <manicennui> That is not at all the problem.
[00:57:04] <manicennui> The problem is that reality is really complex.
[00:57:18] <kline> for example, why argue about the precise meaning of quorum and if you can vote when you can instead just have everyone submit a vote and you get "yes", "no", "inquorate" out

[03:24:31] <buttsbot> How Tumblr Became Popular for Being Obsolete | The New Yorker
[03:24:41] <manicennui> I have noticed that Tumblr has some decent content now.
[03:24:48] <manicennui> For specific interests.
[03:29:27] <manicennui> The Tumblr users I spoke to, both new and returning, cited a few unfashionable aspects that keep them using the platform. Tumblr’s main feed doesn’t shuffle posts algorithmically based on what it determines might appeal to a user. It’s “a good, old chronological river,” Maryellen Stewart, a social-media consultant who has kept a running diary on Tumblr since 2014, said.
[03:29:55] <manicennui> Users spoke of the platform feeling disconnected from the “real world”—no President would ever try to shape world events with a Tumblr post.
[03:31:45] <manicennui> I didn't realize that Flickr was sold to SmugMug.
[03:31:48] <manicennui> That's kind of crazy.
[03:31:57] <manicennui> I remember when SmugMug was the up and coming company.
[03:32:46] <jjuran> "no President would ever try to shape world events with a Tumblr post." <— That's why I'll be announcing my run for office on Lobsters :-)
[03:33:35] <manicennui> Holy shit. Verizon reportedly sold Tumblr to Automattic for $3 million.
[03:33:43] <manicennui> Yahoo bought it for $1.1 billion.

[03:33:54] <jjuran> Bwahahaha
[03:33:55] <manicennui> Did Yahoo do a single solid deal in their lifetime?
[03:35:03] <manicennui> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mergers_and_acquisitions_by_Yahoo!
[03:35:04] <buttsbot> List of mergers and acquisitions by Yahoo! - Wikipedia
[03:35:36] <manicennui> $436,000,000 for hotjobs. Remember them?
[03:36:23] <manicennui> Monster paid $225 million to acquire it from Yahoo.
[03:39:22] <manicennui> Wonder whether they made enough profit on any of these companies during the time they held them to make the purchase worthwhile.
[03:41:18] <manicennui> "Verizon Media Group is a hodgepodge of assets, with some more valuable than others. The group generated about $7 billion in revenue in 2020 and $1.9 billion in the first quarter of 2021, up 10.4% over a year earlier, when pandemic quarantines first led to advertising spending declines."
[03:41:26] <manicennui> That includes Yahoo, AOL, and other garbage.
[03:42:00] <jjuran> No, even after prompting I can't recall ever having heard of hotjobs.
[03:44:31] <manicennui> Really?
[03:44:39] <manicennui> It was pretty popular back when Monster was popular.
[03:45:03] <manicennui> Maybe Monster still is popular among the type of companies I don't want to work at.
[03:45:17] <jjuran> I guess it's just a thoroughly forgettable name.
[03:45:54] <jjuran> I remember Monster, Dice, and CareerBuilder.
[03:46:15] <manicennui> We use this service at work called hotjar. Another coworker and I would make jokes about it implying that it was something else.
[03:46:26] <manicennui> "Gonna go watch some hotjar videos in private now."
[03:46:32] <jjuran> Is it Java-related?
[03:46:35] <manicennui> Nah.
[03:46:41] <manicennui> It like records what users do on your site.
[03:47:00] <jjuran> Of course it does.  Hence the name, right?
[03:47:39] <companion_cube> "hotjobs" sounds like corporate onlyfans
[03:48:08] <manicennui> How about hotmail?
[03:48:45] <jjuran> Too infamous for obscurity
[03:48:50] <manicennui> From the hotjar site: "Filter by rage clicks & u-turns".
[03:49:16] <companion_cube> "Mail" isn't as sexual as "job"
[03:49:30] <manicennui> companion_cube: Only a short distance to male.
[03:50:00] <jjuran> The Blackberry company was previously named Research in Motion
[03:50:01] <companion_cube> It's raining mails, alleluia? :DD
[03:50:09] <manicennui> butter males
[03:50:17] <jjuran> I wonder what sort of career opportunities they had
[03:50:29] <jjuran> at RIM
[03:50:34] <manicennui> jjuran: I bet gwozniak was required to learn about RIM in school.
[03:50:52] <manicennui> Since they were like Canada's most famous tech company.
[03:50:53] <companion_cube> I guess their west coast office was the pacific RIM
[03:51:27] <jjuran> If they had launched a rocket, it would be Sky RIM
[03:51:34] <manicennui> They should actually use RIM as a case study, at the very least for business classes.
[03:51:48] <manicennui> In 2007 when they laughed at the iPhone.
[03:52:52] <manicennui> Looks like their revenue didn't peak until 2011.
[03:53:22] <manicennui> Almost $20 billion.
[03:53:34] <manicennui> Last year it was less than $1 billion.
[03:54:17] <manicennui> "Now, most of BlackBerry’s revenue comes from its enterprise software and services and BlackBerry Technology Solutions (BTS) business segments."
[03:54:20] <manicennui> Who still uses that crap?
[03:54:27] <manicennui> Some companies maintaining legacy shit?
[03:56:51] <companion_cube> I think you can use their software on smartphones now
[03:57:06] <jjuran> If they made an airship that flew erratically, the soundtrack would be RIM-Sky-Korsakov :-P
[03:57:06] <manicennui> Hmm. They still own QNX.
[03:57:14] <companion_cube> Lots of companies probably have deep integration with RIM?
[04:00:48] <manicennui> Silly companies.
[04:01:38] <manicennui> I bet you could make a good amount of money with an email service aimed at executives that didn't actually do anything special.
[04:01:57] <manicennui> Just make it somewhat exclusive and expensive, and throw in a few nebulous claims about superiority.
[04:02:22] <manicennui> That is honestly what Blackberry felt like to me.
[04:02:37] <manicennui> No one could ever tell me what their Exchange add-ons did other than nebulous claims of security.

[04:03:14] <manicennui> And no one could explain how any additional security it provided mattered once their message left our Exchange server.
[04:03:53] <manicennui> I suppose it was possible that there was some special crap it did if one Blackberry user sent a message to another Blackberry user.
[04:04:10] <manicennui> But the Blackberry was never really that ubiquitous.

[04:58:00] <gwozniak> But I was there in 2010-2012 when it was clear the downhill trajectory was coming
[05:08:20] <cb> rip rimjobs
[05:10:13] <gwozniak> Now they're bbjobs
[05:11:14] <gwozniak> Reading the history here and I gotta say that the problem with squabbling over the wording in contracts likely isn't the wording of the contract, it's someone who wants to squabble so that they can get more of what they want
[05:11:36] <gwozniak> If this was expressed in code, it would solve nothing
[05:12:21] <gwozniak> I really fail to see how DAO's are going to do anything useful
[05:12:45] <gwozniak> It is, imo, doomed to fail.  It just may take a while to get there
[05:13:12] <gwozniak> And we'll be back to where we were before people started thinking DAOs were some sort of saviour
[05:20:12] <drakonis> what is even a dao
[05:21:02] <cb> data access objects, microsoft database api
[05:23:01] <kline> drakonis, when you make things like contracts/constitutions/bylaws machine interpretable and executable so as to remove human interpration from their use
[05:23:12] <kline> right now a lot of people have wanted to do them on the ETH blockchain etc
[05:23:38] <drakonis> sounds insane
[05:23:46] <kline> i still think that cryptocurrency has potential but i dont think any of the extant cryptocurrencies are at all well designed and their true value is all really $0
[05:24:01] <kline> so right now its just a speculation machine where the trick is to get out with your profits before it reaches there
[05:24:25] <drakonis> whoever's left holding the bag loses
[05:24:38] <kline> but i do like the idea of being able to do proper cloud execution stuff like on eth, except for eth specifically theyve already shown if they dont like the results theyll just break the machine and implement what they wanted instead
[05:24:55] <kline> which obviously massively undermines the whole thing
[05:25:10] <kline> so again, theres eth in my eyes with a true value of $0

[05:57:04] <manicennui> And many industries are frequently affected by new laws, which mean changes to that code and often, more bugs.
[05:57:55] <manicennui> companion_cube: Sorry.
[05:59:32] <manicennui> companion_cube: I suppose. I just don't understand what it offered over standard email with regards to email.
[05:59:45] <companion_cube> I honestly don't know
[05:59:52] <companion_cube> maybe it was a promise of better security
[05:59:54] <companion_cube> like you said
[06:00:09] <manicennui> That definitely seemed to be what the marketing was about.
[06:00:20] <companion_cube> but maybe like, if you write to another blackberry user (and why would you address plebs?) it would be guaranteed to be "secure"
[06:00:39] <manicennui> But what is described by the other link I shared sounds just like standard encryption between the server and client, but specific to blackberry devices.
[06:01:04] <manicennui> Sounds like they later integrated standard email protocols.
[06:01:22] <manicennui> companion_cube: I think that is what BB messenger did.
[06:01:33] <manicennui> Which was more like IM.
[06:01:36] <companion_cube> it's a bit like asking why iMessage exists :)
[06:01:45] <manicennui> companion_cube: Yes, but that's not what I'm confused about.
[06:01:50] <manicennui> I'm asking about the Exchange add-on.
[06:02:10] <manicennui> It really does seem like they just forced their users to use it because there weren't a bunch of BB apps available.
[06:02:25] <manicennui> So you bought the Exchange add-on and used their app to talk to it.
[06:02:31] <manicennui> Good racket.
[06:02:40] <companion_cube> worked for a good while!
[06:03:52] <manicennui> I bet Apple could pull it off today with business users.
[06:04:17] <manicennui> Sell some bullshit server software that promises better security for iPhone users.

[06:42:14] <kline> manicennui | kline: That is not what happens. You cannot remove yourself from the legal system because you write code.
[06:42:23] <kline> thats not what i think anyone is trying to do
[06:42:55] <kline> what people are trying to do is remove the need for people to bicker, on a day to day basis, how things like constitutions should be interpreted
[06:43:30] <manicennui> I don't understand why you or they believe that is possible because you have code instead of English.
[06:43:52] <manicennui> And if you are bickering daily, you probably are part of a highly dysfunctional organization.
[06:44:23] <kline> because code has objective outputs
[06:44:30] <manicennui> That isn't the issue though.
[06:44:37] <manicennui> Who writes the code?
[06:44:44] <manicennui> Are they incapable of introducing bugs?
[06:44:54] <manicennui> Who comes up with the rules in the first place?
[06:44:55] <kline> this is no different to writing bylaws that are wrong
[06:45:02] <manicennui> Who verifies that the code does what was agreed to?
[06:45:10] <manicennui> It is very different.
[06:45:16] <manicennui> Fewer people understand code.
[06:46:00] <kline> there are two issues being discussed here: type 1: when you tried to write something down, and what is written down doesnt match the authors intention
[06:46:19] <manicennui> Code doesn't help with these things.
[06:46:31] <kline> i agree, instead we look to type 2
[06:46:34] <manicennui> It just makes a specific interpretation very rigid.
[06:46:54] <manicennui> Not to mention the problem of writing code to implement anything more than trivial rules.
[06:47:10] <kline> type 2: where what is written matches the authors intention, but leaves sufficient room for interpretation by other people that its unclear what the intention was
[06:48:07] <kline> if the author is not around to answer, or is challenged on what is right, in english written contracts, you need to have some kind of arbitration where the different parties (one of which may be, but does not have to be, the author) come to a shared agreement
[06:48:08] <manicennui> And none of this matters because 1. if someone wants to challenge things, the code isn't going to stop them and 2. if your organization is as dysfunctional as you describe, nothing is going to help
[06:48:17] <kline> sometimes this will be lawyers involved, sometimes not
[06:48:55] <manicennui> Except all of that will still happen, but now you have to translate from code to English, and all of the problems that come with that, to involve those people.
[06:49:13] <kline> however, if you both agree ahead of time that the code are the bylaws, then interpretation is done by computer, which is objective, and not down to who can argue their case better or convince the other
[06:49:34] <kline> it might still end up being a type 1 error: that in trying to write code (or legalese), the author fails to correctly encode their intent
[06:49:39] <manicennui> Really doesn't matter. You can still involve lawyers.
[06:50:08] <kline> but type 2 errors i think are broadly more common - disputes over agreed upon sets of rules where there is a difference of understanding of what they mean
[06:50:19] <manicennui> Software based rules aren't even recognized as a legal contract AFAIK.
[06:51:22] <manicennui> I think gwozniak is right here. It isn't even about the rules.
[06:51:23] <kline> well, contracts are legal instruments, and not simply written documents, which is why you can have verbal, implied etc contracts
[06:51:39] <manicennui> If I want something to happen and it is important enough to me, I'll use a lawyer to find a way.
[06:51:48] <manicennui> And it won't matter what the software does.
[06:52:11] <kline> i dont think there is a particular leap to suggest that if both people agree that a software with sha hash of xyz will bring about the decisions that this would be an issue
[06:52:13] <kline> but its not really about that
[06:52:32] <manicennui> kline: I just don't fundamentally understand why you believe this solves anything.
[06:52:53] <kline> manicennui, is it the case that people disagree over the interpretation of written, human language rules - yes or no?
[06:53:03] <manicennui> Even iron clad language with lots of precedent can change if the law changes or precedent changes.
[06:53:09] <manicennui> kline: Of course.
[06:53:12] <kline> ok
[06:54:20] <kline> if people agree that 1) a given machine interpreter should be used and 2) a given program for that interpreter specifies the rules they will follow, that this eliminates any kind of dispute in interpretation, and moves us away from "i meant what i wrote but we disagree on the meaning of what was written"
[06:54:31] <kline> (because you now have an objective and pre-agreed interpretation)
[06:54:34] <manicennui> Why would anyone agree to that?
[06:54:48] <manicennui> You'd have to be completely ignorant of how software works, and the problems with implementing complex logic.
[06:54:59] <kline> >why would anyone agree
[06:55:12] <manicennui> As well as the inability of software to sufficiently interact with the real world.
[06:55:21] <kline> well, we already have arbitration clauses in actual written contracts to try and bring about objective, 3rd party interpreters
[06:55:30] <kline> theres no reason why these have to be people rather than software
[06:55:40] <manicennui> Of course there is.
[06:55:44] <manicennui> Because reality is fucking complex.
[06:55:59] <kline> im not suggesting that its suitable for every case
[06:56:33] <kline> but suitable cases do exist already
[06:56:45] <manicennui> I struggle to think of a single case where you gain any benefit from involving blockchain in this. If you want to automate voting or whatever, you can already do that without blockchain.
[06:56:52] <manicennui> Describe one.
[06:56:58] <kline> i dont think blockchain is important to this at all
[06:57:19] <kline> just because some people are doing it on eth doesnt mean that eth or blockchains are inherent to this
[06:57:31] <kline> indeed, i think eth is bad and doomed to die, and the sooner the better
[06:57:36] <manicennui> But they are because most of these things are ultimately scams.
[06:58:02] <manicennui> But we can set that aside.
[06:58:03] <kline> lots of actual contracts are scams, too. there are many agreements written and agreed to that are essentially unfair or one-sided
[06:58:10] <kline> thanks, we should set that aside
[06:59:00] <kline> ok, tennis is in the news a lot this week, lets create a contrived example
[06:59:44] <kline> say there are 10 players and they all agree to put some money in a pool, and say that at the end of the season, the best player keeps the pool. its a fun bet, why not, just between friends
[06:59:56] <kline> every player has a set of stats that are tracked across the season
[07:00:35] <kline> and the players even agree a formula on how their final score is based on these stats (so that "the best" is fair and considers all these stats fairly weighted - after all, each player has their own unique strengths and weaknesses)
[07:00:47] <kline> at the end of the year, one player comes out on top
[07:01:56] <kline> player 3 comes out and says: "no, you got the order of operations wrong - in my home country we teach <some slightly different but entirely valid order of operations>. i know that in the american way of teaching, player 1 wins, but in the european way of teaching, i, player 3 would win"
[07:02:25] <kline> here is a type 2 issue: everyone agrees on the intention and what was written, but there is still sufficient ambiguity
[07:02:55] <kline> right now, what we do is we spend a lot of money on some kind of arbitration system who decides in this case what order of operations is used and who ends up taking the pot
[07:03:49] <kline> this could have been avoided up front if they said "and to implement the formula, we will use this very short python script, on python 3.9" - and then in doing so, this kind of ambiguity is pre-resolved
[07:04:12] <manicennui> So you want a group of tennis players to agree to a piece of software they don't understand?
[07:04:14] <kline> (as a bonus, in this instance, players can even wargame a bunch of different inputs and see and understand how the contract would pan out, verify it for themselves, etc)
[07:04:35] <kline> manicennui, they could decide to do it in excel, which they could all understand
[07:04:43] <manicennui> Would they?
[07:04:49] <kline> sure
[07:04:51] <manicennui> I don't think the average person understand anything beyond the basics.
[07:05:01] <manicennui> And many people don't understand the basics.
[07:05:04] <kline> most people dont understand contracts and hire lawyers
[07:05:13] <manicennui> For good reason.
[07:05:20] <kline> i dont think people not understanding code and hiring programmers is vastly different
[07:05:34] <manicennui> Except that if there is a real dispute, lawyers might become involved.
[07:05:40] <manicennui> Programmers would never be the final say.
[07:05:54] <manicennui> And then you have the added problem of translating from code to English.
[07:06:03] <kline> but its still the case that the vast majority of agreements like this are still agreed upon without lawyers, and probably in the future, people will have such agreements in things like excel or python
[07:06:11] <manicennui> And I'm sure someone could make a good case that they didn't fully understand what they were agreeing to.
[07:06:26] <kline> all of these issues all still apply to english-written contracts
[07:06:37] <manicennui> It's hard to make any claims about agreements "like this" because it is a fairly ridiculous scenario.
[07:06:40] <kline> all we're doing is shifting where the arbitration sits
[07:07:00] <kline> i dont think it really is, lots of stuff like this really does exist in real life
[07:07:05] <manicennui> People only agree to contracts without involving lawyers for things that are fairly standard, or highly regulated.
[07:07:28] <kline> yes, in practice the whole "stats in a formula" bit is contrived but its still true, people do stuff like this for things like fantasy football
[07:07:29] <manicennui> And once you get to something as expensive as a house, a lawyer is involved.
[07:07:42] <kline> im not saying we should use this for houses
[07:07:58] <kline> housing sales are obviously not appropriate usecases
[07:08:10] <kline> and housing sales have lots of complex legal requirements in various places
[07:08:24] <kline> but there are many many many more agreements that could be implemented like this
[07:08:25] <manicennui> Most people playing fantasy football are either doing among a small group of people who are not risking much, or they are using a platform that ultimately decides.
[07:08:43] <manicennui> s/doing among/doing so among/
[07:08:45] <kline> right, this kind of stuff is happening already
[07:08:53] <kline> so its not impossible, its happening literally every day
[07:09:10] <kline> and surprise, outside of the cryptocurrency world its much less likely to be a scam
[07:09:33] <manicennui> I'm sure there have been lawsuits over fantasy football, but ultimately, people are fine with allowing software written by some gambling company decide because it is mostly right, and they generally aren't risking much.
[07:10:20] *** Quits: jjuran (~jjuran@c-73-172-196-113.hsd1.va.comcast.net) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[07:10:24] <manicennui> Just like I write software which implements lending, and most of the time, things go fine or users call in with problems and we resolve them.
[07:10:43] <manicennui> But people absolutely involve outside parties. In our case that is regulators.
[07:10:49] <kline> im sure there have, and im sure there would be similar lawsuits over english contracts and will be similar lawsuits over computer-driven decision making
[07:10:52] <manicennui> And we have regulators checking on us all the time.
[07:10:56] *** Joins: jjuran (~jjuran@c-73-172-196-113.hsd1.va.comcast.net)
[07:10:57] <kline> for example, if the contract is correct, fair, etc
[07:11:13] <kline> (outright unfair or malicious contracts are generally not legally valid)
[07:11:19] <manicennui> I think the lending case is much more realistic.
[07:11:35] <kline> these problems are outside of the scope of what they try to solve
[07:11:39] <manicennui> There is an actual English contract that the customer agrees to, and we try our best to make the software implement the rules of the contract.
[07:11:46] <manicennui> And sometimes we get it wrong.
[07:11:50] <manicennui> And sometimes the law changes.
[07:12:07] <kline> its about providing a system of resolving decisions and arbitration that doesnt boil down to how well you can convince people of your personal understanding
[07:12:45] <manicennui> kline: In lending specifically, in the developed world, not understanding the contract is actually a valid problem.
[07:12:55] <manicennui> And the regulators tend to side with customers.
[07:12:57] <kline> and ideally, these systems are deterministic and hopefully you could hire staff lawyer-programmers who could tell you ahread of time that it really is fair
[07:13:26] <kline> rather than not knowing until the day what judge youre going to get, only to find out that that judge has a reputation for ruling one way or another based on their legal scholarship
[07:13:42] <manicennui> The UK especially requires that you make every effort to make sure you are not selling products and services that the customer is unlikely to understand.
[07:13:52] <kline> im not sure what this has to do with anything
[07:14:21] <kline> i mostly want to talk about the case of equal parties contracting between each other, not highly capitalised organisations pushing products on the general public
[07:14:23] <manicennui> kline: It means that you can't just claim that they agreed to use this software and the software says this, and that is final.
[07:14:42] <manicennui> No one in the real world cares that you think your software is correct.
[07:15:05] <manicennui> And on one who has done any amount of development is arrogant enough to believe that their software is always correct.
[07:15:20] <kline> again, im not saying that this addresses writing correct software
[07:15:22] <manicennui> The idea that there would be a bunch of people skilled in software and the law is laughable.
[07:15:46] <manicennui> I'm sure a small amount of those people do exist and work at companies like Relativity.
[07:15:51] <kline> you can have buggy code contracts in the exact same way as you can write english contracts with loopholes that end up exploited by your other party
[07:16:24] <manicennui> kline: Take the case of lending again. Our software is wrong, far, far more often than the contracts are wrong.
[07:16:44] <kline> i dont think this is a case where it would be useful to apply this
[07:16:48] <manicennui> I'm struggling to think of a time that the contracts have been wrong in the last 7+ years I have worked there except when the software somehow makes them wrong.
[07:17:04] <manicennui> kline: But it is a good example of how much better the legal profession is at this.
[07:17:15] <kline> you can throw out chaff in the form of places where it shouldnt be used, but i dont think youre addressing the core of this at all
[07:17:41] <manicennui> They spend a bunch of time writing and reviewing these contracts, and we hire outside counsel to review them as well.
[07:17:49] <kline> how many of these contracts need to go to arbitration because of disagreements on the meaning?
[07:18:02] <manicennui> kline: I'm not suggesting that you are suggesting we use this for lending.
[07:18:11] <kline> then why are we talking about it?
[07:18:15] <manicennui> I'm suggesting that we are far worse at writing software than we are at writing English contracts.
[07:19:00] <kline> i would agree, if you generally mean things like "how often do we accidentally write contracts that have exploitable loopholes or are legally unenforceable"
[07:19:32] <kline> but i dont agree that its the case that contracts, law, etc are written such that they are unambiguous, or else you wouldnt see them so frequently argued in civil court
[07:19:51] <manicennui> I'm not claiming that either, but software is even worse.
[07:20:02] <imode> if you think ambiguities are bad for existing contracts, wait until you have to deal with that in software, without a human in the loop.
[07:20:04] <manicennui> So why replace one problem with an even worse one?
[07:20:31] <manicennui> And a great deal of lawsuits have nothing to do with how well the contract is written.
[07:20:36] <kline> now, they arent being argued in civil court because someone decided to out and out break it, what im suggesting is that there are frequently disagreements in how they should be interpreted, and if you both agree on the interpreter and how it should be arbitrated, these kinds of disagreements can be avoided entirely
[07:20:56] <kline> and ideally, the software should be deterministic so you can even test your expectations ahead of time
[07:21:05] <manicennui> kline: As gwozniak stated, most of those disagreements are not fundamentally about the contract language.
[07:21:09] <kline> (really, i think non-deterministic contracts are a terrible idea but im sure people do what them)
[07:21:09] <imode> the interpretation of a contract isn't really under dispute in 99% of cases.
[07:21:12] <manicennui> The contract language is a tool to get what they want.
[07:21:39] <manicennui> kline: And how would you test complex software contracts? More software.
[07:21:48] <kline> imode, youre entirely wrong, most of the time it absolutely is the interpretation of the wording
[07:21:51] <manicennui> And we all know that tests are always perfect.
[07:21:58] <imode> care to present examples.
[07:22:10] <manicennui> kline: Again, you are seeing the action, but not the reason.
[07:22:51] <manicennui> If I decide that I don't like the way a project is going, having my lawyers find an argument to make about the contract might be a good way to get what I want.
[07:23:08] <kline> imode, a really good example of where this would be relevant to us, would be how oracle and google disagreed on how copyright law should be interpreted with respect to APIs. now obviously we cant computerise that case, nor should we, but these are the kinds of dispute im talking about
[07:23:26] <manicennui> It's even possible that the contract was solid when written, but the law has since changed, or new precedence has been set.
[07:23:45] <imode> but if that's the kind of dispute you're talking about, and that type of dispute can't be computerized, then you're arguing that we should do something we can't do.
[07:24:55] <kline> imode, this is the kind of writ-large dispute that cannot be computerised, yes, but there are lots of smaller instances of these kinds of disagreements in interpretation we see in smaller forms in everyday life and in business
[07:24:59] <manicennui> I still maintain that the best use of computers is to automate things that already exist.
[07:25:05] <imode> ..like what.
[07:25:08] <manicennui> And they are bad at most other things.
[07:25:15] <kline> the law is a bad place to apply it, generally, because the law is full of really horrible stuff that is hard to computerise
[07:25:17] <manicennui> imode: Like an accounting system.
[07:25:31] <kline> but its not exclusively the case, for example, the french tax laws are computer programs already
[07:25:34] <imode> manicennui: I was responding to kline.
[07:25:37] <Xe> ah semiotics
[07:25:41] <manicennui> The interesting cases are where new emergent properties develop from automating something, like communication.
[07:26:15] <imode> fwiw we have vendor contracts that are already automated/scripted within the accounting and royalties space. we've already automated this.
[07:26:32] <manicennui> kline: And arguably US tax laws are computerized in most cases, in the form of TurboTax and the IRS software. They aren't hand validating most returns.
[07:26:36] <kline> imode, so in france you absolutely cannot argue that rules should be applied in, for example, different orders where the legislation is ambiguous to try and minimise your taxes, because theres a program where you plug in details and get numbers out
[07:26:44] <manicennui> kline: But the computer system does not have the final say.
[07:26:55] <kline> manicennui, right, but in france it can
[07:27:06] <imode> (just speaking from amazon's perspective)
[07:27:07] <kline> manicennui, ultimately in the US, the code is based on an interpretation of the written law
[07:28:11] <imode> utterly mechanical things should probably be automated with inlets for human intervention. machines should be able to do things that machines are suited to do.
[07:28:36] <kline> manicennui, you might see an argument arise, for example, if the IRS automated validation differs in interpretation from the turbotax interpretation. but in france, there is a single programmatic intperpretation that is the canon truth
[07:28:36] <manicennui> kline: And there are absolutely tax lawsuits in France.
[07:28:42] <kline> sure
[07:28:53] <imode> anything outside of that that has a genuine need to be interpreted and/or expands unbelievably in terms of an interpretation space.. can't be automated.
[07:28:57] <manicennui> And I'm guessing that people win sometimes, otherwise no one would bother.
[07:29:08] <imode> someone's guilt in a criminal case can't be decided by a machine, for example.
[07:29:12] <kline> manicennui, i would expect they take different forms
[07:29:20] <manicennui> imode: guiltyornot.com
[07:29:26] <kline> imode, agreed, we shouldnt generally be using these here
[07:29:50] <manicennui> Just bring it to /r/AmITheAsshole
[07:29:51] <imode> so you're generally narrowing these down to finance or event-driven situations.
[07:29:53] <companion_cube> kline: https://gitlab.inria.fr/verifisc/mlang ? :)
[07:29:54] <buttsbot> Verifisc / Mlang · GitLab
[07:30:09] <kline> imode, we're doing a very programmer thing where we overgeneralise - automated contracts are absolutely not applicable everywhere, but that doesnt mean theyre not valuable anywhere
[07:30:28] <kline> there are places where they can better resolve these issues than natural language agreements
[07:30:30] <imode> whereby a system can actually verify that someone did some X, that someone is who they say they are, that X satisfies criteria Y, triggering result Z.
[07:30:41] <imode> or something similar. business rules.
[07:30:51] <imode> the thing is, this is everywhere in large scale business.
[07:31:04] <imode> amazon's done it. we have to do it. we have hundreds of thousands of vendors.
[07:31:04] <kline> like i pointed out, its good for situations where everyone agrees on what is written, but not how it should be interpreted
[07:31:11] <manicennui> kline: I think ultimately you are saying that we can automate a lot of rules, and those systems will be useful in enough cases to justify themselves. But I don't see how that then extends to not needing the legal system or solving any fundamental human problems.
[07:31:16] <kline> if people have a canon interpreter, then you cannot really debate that
[07:31:28] <imode> eh, I don't think the interpretation is the issue here. speaking at large, it's mostly the _execution_.
[07:31:30] <kline> manicennui, im not syaing that
[07:31:40] <imode> you need to verify all parties are adhering to their ends of the contract.
[07:31:56] <kline> sure, and thats not inside the scope of what i think is useful
[07:31:58] <imode> and an easy way to do that is to turn it into an event based system with well-known inlets for human interaction.
[07:32:02] <kline> but english language contracts cant do that either
[07:32:03] <manicennui> kline: We have yet to hear an example where a computer is the absolute authority and the law has no power.
[07:32:09] <imode> well,  you can actually do that.
[07:32:13] <imode> we're doing that.
[07:32:17] <imode> we've been doing that for decades.
[07:32:31] <manicennui> And no sane person would agree to a system where there is no legal recourse.
[07:32:53] <kline> imode, a written contract itself cannot say, for example that someone built something correctly, nor can a programmed contract, you still would need a surveyor to say "yes thats to standard" or to press the equivalent button on the program
[07:32:57] <manicennui> Except in cases where so little is at stake that it doesn't matter.
[07:33:32] <imode> kline: not the scope I mean. I mean if someone didn't meet a particular criteria that can be mechanically verified.
[07:33:48] <imode> building something correctly such as a house isn't mechanically verifiable. yet.
[07:34:09] <kline> manicennui, the court of the land will always have ultimate power, my point is that by agreeing on the interpretation and resolution mechanism being one thats mechanical rather than hoping you have written an unambiguous enough contract, that you can avoid needing to dispute it in court in the first place
[07:34:18] <imode> paying vendors is mechanically verifiable.
[07:34:32] <kline> im not even really interested in that
[07:34:35] <imode> taking a cut of vendor sales that's according to a vendor contract is mechanically verifiable.
[07:34:43] <imode> well I'm talking about a real-world example from one of the largest companies in the world.
[07:34:47] <imode> of smart contracts.
[07:35:00] <manicennui> kline: As a software engineer, I don't even want to agree to a "software contract". I want a written contract.
[07:35:09] <kline> imode, specifically im interested in resolving decisions where the decision making criteria, written in english, leaves room for differing (and potentially equally valid) interpretations
[07:35:24] <manicennui> Not having a written contract would be a colossal impediment to any legal action.
[07:35:28] <manicennui> And probably isn't entirely legal.
[07:35:30] <Xe> manicennui: if work.do() { money.get() }
[07:35:32] <imode> ...then there's no point, because the contract will be written according to those specifications.
[07:35:35] <manicennui> Depending on domain.
[07:35:39] <imode> and if they are ambiguous, then the contract is ambiguous.
[07:35:44] <imode> otherwise you choose an interpretation.
[07:35:58] <imode> and if you have more than one valid interpretation, you're enforcing a particular view on a contract.
[07:36:04] <kline> right, but if the two parties cannot agree on the interpretation after the fact, then you need some kind of 3rd party arbiter
[07:36:11] <kline> sometimes thats an arbitration service
[07:36:14] <imode> which is why law is written, my dude.
[07:36:19] <kline> sometimes its a court
[07:36:22] <imode> and contracts are written, my dude.
[07:36:33] <kline> imode, did you read my example about the tennis players?
[07:36:37] <manicennui> Xe: function do() { return true; }
[07:36:39] <imode> no, came into it late.
[07:36:46] <kline> ok, ill pm you the basics
[07:37:18] <imode> no worries I can scroll back and read.
[07:37:43] <manicennui> kline: I think you should use fantasy football instead.
[07:38:16] <imode> "this could have been avoided up front if they said "and to implement the formula, we will use this very short python script, on python 3.9" - and then in doing so, this kind of ambiguity is pre-resolved"
[07:38:26] <imode> so, here's the problem with that.
[07:38:38] <imode> who gets to decide what the ambiguity gets resolved _to_.
[07:39:11] <imode> that's the problem and kind of the point of ambiguity.
[07:39:33] <imode> is that two parties have the opportunity to have an open dialogue and come to a compromise in the face of nearly infinite or very large choice spaces.
[07:39:40] <companion_cube> can't wait to use AFL to find tax loopholes
[07:39:57] <manicennui> companion_cube: I was hoping that you would interject with a demand for static types in these contracts.
[07:40:16] <imode> I would rather leave things open to discussion than have someone pre-decide what those ambiguities get resolved to.
[07:40:52] <imode> and if there's a disagreement when the contract is drafted.. _you still need the damn arbiter_.
[07:41:05] <kline> right, but you've pre-agreed on the arbiter
[07:41:07] <imode> all you've done is make it so that an intermediate language that has deterministic or at least mechanically computable operations.
[07:41:16] <imode> so I still need to spend the money.
[07:41:21] <imode> for the arbiter.
[07:41:26] <kline> python, rather than someone (say a court) who you have to convince your way is right
[07:41:27] <imode> we still need to spend time to resolve the ambiguity.
[07:41:37] <imode> so, why python.
[07:41:48] <imode> why not X language that conforms to the way the other person ranks players.
[07:42:01] <kline> its not important, because you dont sign the contract if you dont agree
[07:42:07] <imode> okay, so nobody agrees.
[07:42:12] <companion_cube> manicennui: honestly if we're talking about formalising tax code
[07:42:14] <imode> congratulations, you've done.. nothing.
[07:42:18] <companion_cube> I want coq, not just basic types
[07:42:19] <kline> but youre moving that issue up-front, so no one has skin in the game
[07:42:26] <manicennui> companion_cube: Let's use floats for money.
[07:42:29] <imode> pretty sure if someone's drafting a contract that's already up front.
[07:42:34] <imode> like, that's kind of the point.
[07:42:34] <kline> it would be far better to be deadlocked because your money is committed or work done
[07:42:44] <kline> than to get to the end and realise theres an issue you dont agree on
[07:42:50] <manicennui> "I'm sorry, you still owe 0.00000000001 in taxes."
[07:42:56] <kline> s/because/before
[07:43:33] <imode> why is that "better". there are ambiguities that aren't due to malicious disagreements between parties and are just a side effect of the business rules you're intending on modeling, and you want both parties to suffer.. something in lieu of just having this arbitrated?
[07:43:35] <kline> imode, this kind of decision is already in existence, where you can pre-agree what jurisdiction applies to a contract if you are in different jurisdictions
[07:43:50] <imode> I don't see the point of any of this.
[07:44:18] <imode> it's like trying to do digital logic simulation and verification without including floating inputs.
[07:44:18] <kline> but if you were to say python instead of a legal jurisdiction, its still faster, cheaper, and you can even test up front and deterministically rather than having to chance it in court that you can be more convincing
[07:44:41] <imode> "either it's a ONE or a ZERO" "but what if we actually _have_ floating inputs" "no, we can't"
[07:44:52] <kline> whats the floating input in the tennis scenario
[07:44:57] <companion_cube> a float is just 64 ones and zeroes !!!
[07:45:05] <imode> 32, thank you very much. ;)
[07:45:25] <imode> kline: the ambiguity in how rankings are calculated cross-region.
[07:45:36] <imode> and how, say, two players rank together from different regions.
[07:45:54] <kline> based on how they each interpret the formula?
[07:46:06] <kline> because of those differing backgrounds and regions?
[07:46:16] <imode> assume that you have a different formula between regions.
[07:46:18] <companion_cube> imode: how quaint
[07:46:20] <kline> no
[07:46:22] <companion_cube> are you from the past? :p
[07:46:26] <kline> thats not what i am proposing
[07:46:31] <imode> companion_cube: floats are 32, doubles are 64!
[07:46:42] <companion_cube> f32 are 32 bits, f64 are 64 bits!
[07:46:50] <imode> D O U B L E
[07:46:51] <kline> the 10 players agree between themselves on a single formula they will all use
[07:46:54] <imode> P R E C I S I O N
[07:46:56] <imode> F L O A T I N G
[07:46:58] <imode> P O I N T
[07:47:00] <imode> N U M B E R S
[07:47:11] <companion_cube> "double" is like a C-era name, it sucks
[07:47:16] <imode> yeah it does.
[07:47:16] <companion_cube> like "long" 😂
[07:47:21] <imode> can we have a triple.
[07:47:26] <kline> the problem is that because they have different elementary school educations, some of them will do the orders of operation differently
[07:47:31] <companion_cube> f128?
[07:47:38] <kline> neither is correct, its a genuine and honest ambiguity
[07:47:38] <imode> jfc there's apparently quadruples.
[07:48:02] *** Quits: jjuran (~jjuran@c-73-172-196-113.hsd1.va.comcast.net) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[07:48:18] <kline> in this case, how do we decide who's order of operations "wins"?
[07:48:27] <kline> (and resolves the decision)
[07:48:42] <kline> (or more clearly, resolves the winner)
[07:48:45] <imode> you have a discussion among the participants and come to some kind of agreement.
[07:49:01] <kline> what if you cannot agree, because both of them want the 10k prize pot
[07:49:21] <imode> then you have to endure a long-ass arbitration.
[07:49:25] <imode> until someone caves.
[07:50:04] <kline> would it not have been smoother, cheaper, and less fractuous to have agreed ahead of time on a mechanical interpretation that everyone could wargame themselves?
[07:50:16] <kline> for example an excel sheet or python 1-liner?
[07:50:46] <imode> why. humans can still ignore the results of code.
[07:50:50] <companion_cube> write it in J!
[07:51:09] <imode> there's no case here where a computer arbiter is an unbiased source.
[07:51:36] <manicennui> I still don't understand the part where tennis players agree to code or an Excel spreadsheet. That is never happening.
[07:51:53] <imode> yeah, seriously.
[07:52:01] <imode> a better example of this would be like, chess or go players.
[07:52:05] <kline> if you agree ahead of time that python3.9 will be the interpreter for the formula, then you cant have a disagreement about whos interpretation of the formula is correct
[07:52:05] <imode> iirc that actually differs by region.
[07:52:09] <kline> because its not peer vs. peer
[07:52:31] <kline> the only interpreter is the objective and deterministic, even at the time of agreement, python
[07:52:41] <imode> aren't you the one who rails against formal methods?
[07:52:47] <imode> why is this any different.
[07:52:54] <kline> i dont rail against formal methods, no
[07:53:02] <imode> must be thinking of someone else.
[07:53:11] <companion_cube> manicennui: well one recently had to cave to a vaccination spreadsheet
[07:53:19] <manicennui> heh
[07:53:24] <imode> ooooooo
[07:53:52] <kline> what i do think is that formal methods are, right now, hard to apply - there are lots of examples of how to solve sudoku or whatever with formal methods, but not many posts that show how formal methods can help you write better software
[07:53:57] <kline> though there have been one or two lately
[07:54:19] <kline> the "verifying video games with formal methods" was one such example
[07:54:43] <kline> (where someone spends an hour proving certain outcomes are/are not possible in an RPG story tree)
[07:55:06] <companion_cube> tbh SAT solvers are one of the most usable technique these days
[07:55:20] <kline> doing this without formal methods is hard and there are games where certain outcomes are accidentally impossible or inevitable despite that not being the writers hopes
[07:55:29] <companion_cube> a friend of mine devs a randomizer for a zelda game, using that to ensure the game remains winnable
[07:55:53] <kline> skyrim for example (thanks bethesda, doing the good work as usual) has a load of places where you just need to open the dev console and turn quest state flags on and off
[07:56:44] <kline> because the storywriters accidentally wrote in conflicting quests that are supposed to be run together but mutually lock each other out because of emergent and unintuitive interactions in the quest tree
[07:56:59] <kline> (these are mostly fixed because players are great fuzzers)
[07:57:19] <kline> but the example of doing it with mass effect in this video was an excellent actual application of it to real software problems
[07:57:45] <kline> whereas i think "solving wordle with z3" is garbage because i dont want to use z3 to solve puzzles, even if its amusing
[07:58:23] <kline> i want to prove, for example, that my python puzzle strat "solves" (like game-theory solves) worlde
[07:59:28] <manicennui> kline: There are systems that are used to verify software for highly critical applications. They cost a fortune.
[07:59:35] <companion_cube>  proving python is and will remain too hard
[07:59:46] <kline> yes, thats fine
[07:59:54] <manicennui> Trying to think of the name of the one...
[07:59:57] <kline> im talking about the strat, not proving python
[08:00:17] <kline> manicennui, sel4 is a good example of a proven kernel
[08:00:26] <companion_cube> some people write formally verified C
[08:00:32] <companion_cube> (or rather, generate it)
[08:00:39] <kline> and contract systems like spark/ada exist for proving some aspects of your own programs
[08:00:41] <companion_cube> e.g. Everest, a TLS stack proved correct
[08:01:00] <kline> i think these are good things
[08:02:08] <kline> what i rail against are people constantly post minesweeper bots written in z3, which doesnt show me how you could use this to improve my python design
[08:02:35] <companion_cube> right
[08:02:44] <kline> whereas the article about proving RPG story trees absolutely does show you how you could identify or improve bugs in those games
[08:02:46] <companion_cube> it's an easy way to use z3, but agreed, not the actually useful one
[08:03:15] <kline> theres one about microsoft proving equivalence in firewalls as well which is quite good
[08:04:17] <kline> they decided to rewrite how they generated and stored firewall rules, and they wrote a z3 based tool to verify that the new version for any generated firewall was the same as the input, old style firewall
[08:05:04] <kline> which is a nice middle ground between "toys written in z3" and "proving other stuff with z3" by using a z3 program as a test of your software being correct in use

[08:17:51] <kline> companion_cube, yeah, its fairly easy to write alternatives, but its nice to see places where formal methods can be used without them being out and out toys
[08:18:11] <companion_cube> I would hope so, since my job relies on that :D
[08:18:26] <kline> which is overwhelmingly my criticism of most submissions to lobsters about formal methods
[08:18:28] <companion_cube> it's not easy to write alternatives to z3 though
[08:18:44] <companion_cube> I know of one credible alternative :/
[08:19:46] <kline> heres an example of a post i dont really get: https://github.com/lorin/dns-alloy
[08:19:46] <buttsbot> GitHub - lorin/dns-alloy: Modeling DNS with Alloy
[08:20:05] <kline> ("Modelling DNS with Alloy" was the submission on the site)
[08:20:15] <kline> im not sure what formal methods really brings to this
[08:20:42] <companion_cube> alloy brings a language, pretty concise, that you can use to model stuff
[08:20:47] <companion_cube> and then you can ask questions to it
[08:20:58] <companion_cube> Hillel Wayne has a lot of content about Alloy on his blog
[08:21:06] <companion_cube> it seems pretty cool tbh
[08:21:29] <kline> did you read that link above?
[08:21:55] <kline> all it really does is specify the structure of dns and then produce a picture of the structure you just wrote down
[08:21:56] <companion_cube> yeah I skimmed through it
[08:22:07] <companion_cube> sure, you can get a model and display it
[08:22:08] <kline> im sure alloy is useful, but this is a terrible article for demonstrating _how_ its useful!
[08:22:14] <companion_cube> but alloy allows you to verify stuff, too
[08:22:17] <companion_cube> sure
[08:22:37] <kline> its a real missed opportunity, it sticks out because im implementing DNS stuff right now
[08:23:17] <kline> id have loved to have found this was going to be in some way useful in making sure i did a better job than i would without alloy, but in the end all it does is show a very very verbose and overcomplicateed alternative to dot and graphviz

[09:12:00] <manicennui> WTF is this song even about?
[09:12:01] <manicennui> hah
[09:12:36] <manicennui> The lyrics of the song tell the story of a condemned criminal on the run to Mexico. Told from a first-person point of view, it describes how an outlaw and convicted multiple murderer, on the run from a death-by-hanging sentence, has to "ride like the wind" to reach "the border of Mexico," where, presumably, the posse in pursuit of him will not be able to reach him.
[09:12:49] <imode> mouth dreams had me in fucking stitches.
[09:12:51] <manicennui> Cross described "Ride Like The Wind" as "sort of a romanticized Western where the bad guy gets away."[citation needed] The setting can be surmised to have been from the time before the United States and Mexico signed their mutual criminal-extradition treaty.
[09:12:53] <manicennui> Hilarious.

[18:55:41] <gwozniak> I've heard of that idiotic faucet thing
[18:55:44] <kline> manicennui, re. the contracts stuff im currently involved in a discussion about whether "7 years" means seven calendar years (ie, 1st january of 2007, 2014, 21, etc) vs. "a year (365 days)" and accepting this means drift relating to leap years
[18:56:49] <kline> how do you mix units in this way unambiguously without it being awkwardly wordy, trading off intelligibility vs. precision of expressing intent
[19:02:29] <riv> Oh that's a good question
[19:02:48] <riv> I think that anyone reasonable would assume 7 calendar years, not 365*7 days
[19:03:50] <kline> the problem is that in some places we use day units and have number of years for ease of reading
[19:04:10] <kline> for example, data retention is 1 year (but implemented as 365 days)
[19:04:30] <kline> and financial stuff is every 1 year, on a given month in a year
[19:05:09] <kline> it would be nice if we could head off any complaints that we "over retained" someones GDPR-related data by 1 day because it was a leap year
[19:06:03] <kline> the way we're probably solving this is doing "one year (365 days)" for when we mean 365 days, and "1 year" for when we mean a calendar year
[19:06:08] <ngoldbaum> just use 365.2425 days :p
[19:06:29] <kline> but its annoying to even have to consider this

[19:55:08] <ngoldbaum> epilys: you’re paid hourly?
[19:55:44] <epilys> I'm self-employed but for non-hourly  (salary) workers, out of hours work payment is protected by law but it is not enforced
[19:56:08] <epilys> so the average employee might work 1-2 hours extra  every day and not get paid for the extra hours
[19:56:22] <epilys> sounds extreme but it's the harsh reality
[19:56:43] <ngoldbaum> here if you’re salaried there’s no such thing as overtime
[19:57:26] <epilys> you can't work overtime or you don't get paid for overtime?
[19:59:12] <ngoldbaum> salaried workers don’t have any legal limits on how much they work per week and there’s no extra compensation if they work more
[19:59:30] <ngoldbaum> so a lot of salaried jobs work 60 hours per week
[19:59:32] <ngoldbaum> or more
[19:59:35] <ngoldbaum> it’s dumb

[20:07:48] <epilys> wow that's terrible. same situation as here, but it's explicit
[20:13:17] <kline> epilys, im salaried, so i do whatever hours are needed to get the job done
[20:14:22] <kline> i dont have to work a lot of hours normally, the the issue is related to someone _arriving_ out of hours because theyve driven a long way at short notice for reasons that are not their fault
[20:14:56] <kline> they dont really want to be here, and theyve been personally very nice about it, and its not an awful lot of work
[20:14:58] <kline> on balance its still a good deal for me
