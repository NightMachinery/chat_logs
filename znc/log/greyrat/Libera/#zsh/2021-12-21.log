[02:41:13] <axisys_> how to hide the error on invalid path when listing a dir.. ls /invalid/path 2>&1 >/dev/null still prints no matches found 
[02:41:47] <phy1729> The error is coming from inside the house^W^W%Wzsh
[02:42:28] <phy1729> zsh errors on globs that don't match anything because it doesn't know if passing it through or omitting it is safe, so it fails safe and errors
[02:44:00] <llua> your redirection is backwards
[02:44:04] <axisys_> so any other way to handle that error? like in python try: except:

[03:46:40] <nickdiazswag209> is there anyway to get suffix fuzzy search capability? or is that too confusing/difficult to implement without it being a performance hog
[03:47:12] <nickdiazswag209> basically, i have a bunch of directories that are prefixed with the same thing, and its kind of a long prefix, like "example-com"

[03:52:20] <nickdiazswag209> Mikachu: what i mean is i have a bunch of directories with "example-com" prefix (ie. example-com-dir1, example-com-dir2...). instead of typing out example-com- everytime... i would like to just type dir<TAB> and have it be able to figure out the right one (this is what i meant by suffix based fuzzy search), is that posible?

[03:53:06] <Mikachu> well, you can either just press tab, or you can type *dir1 and press tab
[03:53:13] <nickdiazswag209> Mikachu: ohh
[03:53:20] <Mikachu> you can set it up so that just dir<tab> works too
[03:53:21] <nickdiazswag209> didn't think about the asterisk
[03:53:23] <nickdiazswag209> let me try that
[03:53:28] <Mikachu> but it can be confusing
[03:54:09] <Mikachu> zstyle ':completion:*' matcher-list 'l:|=* r:|=*'
[03:54:18] <Mikachu> you likely already have a matcher-list for case insensitive completion
[03:54:22] <Mikachu> in that case it would be something like
[03:54:30] <Mikachu> zstyle ':completion:*' matcher-list 'm:{a-z}={A-Z}' +'l:|=* r:|=*'
[03:54:34] <Mikachu> (note the + sign)
[03:54:59] <nickdiazswag209> match * might be too much, i guess i can just replace the * with 'example-com'?
[03:55:09] <Mikachu> the syntax for matcher-list is confusing

I've strange situation, and I'm unsure who is guilty (so and how to fix), tmux or zsh: I'm not sure what exactly cause this, whether it be long time running tmux server, or it's upgrade, or anything else, but sometimes, in some conditions I facing an issue that calling tmux (with piping it's result) from zsh scripts makes that script to freeze on reading from pipe. On the other hand, doing the
