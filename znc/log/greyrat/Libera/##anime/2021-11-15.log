[00:55:25] <Berlin36> holy fuuuuck that was scary
[00:55:39] <Satin> yikes
[00:55:48] <Berlin36> i went about 2 km down a hill 
[00:56:00] <Berlin36> was not very steep
[00:56:04] <Berlin36> but was long
[00:56:39] <Berlin36> idk how fast i was going, but it was insane
[00:57:11] <Berlin36> also i got some speed wobbles for about 2 seconds but it was okay because i could reduce the speed a bit
[00:57:40] <Berlin36> and now i want to downhill again...
[00:57:58] <Satin> be careful
[00:58:27] <Berlin36> i would practice a lot, though i don't have any places where i could
[00:58:40] <JesseDesu> i had a skateboarding accident in 2004
[00:58:50] <Berlin36> the road i downhilled yesterday is a road where cars go 
[00:58:52] <JesseDesu> i went too fast and had to bail
[00:59:03] <Berlin36> oh shi-
[00:59:43] <JesseDesu> i have an awful scar on my knuckle
[00:59:57] <Berlin36> i know a very steep road that also has some curves, but it doesn't last too long because the road ends after it goes down
[00:59:58] <JesseDesu> somehow i didnt break a bone
[01:00:13] <Berlin36> i cracked my elbow a bit when i rollerskated

[01:02:43] <JesseDesu> i havent touched my skateboard since i had another accident on it early this year
[01:02:53] <Berlin36> i see
[01:03:17] <JesseDesu> i fell on my wrist
[01:03:29] <Berlin36> i had a lot of accidents when rollerskating too, but weren't too bad, usually i could skate again after some days
[01:04:00] <JesseDesu> i i have small wheels
[01:04:06] <JesseDesu> i bought 52mm's
[01:04:12] <Berlin36> but what hurts a lot is to fall on the butt xD
[01:04:25] <Berlin36> oh, 52mm are small 
[01:04:33] <Berlin36> on my longboard i have 80mm
[01:04:49] <Berlin36> and my rollerskates were 80mm too, but i tried also 110mm

[01:07:35] <Satin> Qt stuff is so much C++
[01:07:40] <Berlin36> yeah, fuck it
[01:07:52] <Berlin36> i tried once learning qt
[01:08:03] <Berlin36> that's how i quited learning c++
[01:08:07] <Satin> lol
[01:08:12] <Berlin36> and started Go
[01:08:12] <Satin> i only know basic C
[01:08:18] <Satin> i just wanted to add an UI....
[01:08:20] <Berlin36> and honestly, Go is so much fun lmao
[01:08:48] <Berlin36> i've been learning c++ for a few months and it felt like i don't learn anything new because everything was so hard
[01:09:08] <Berlin36> but with go now i can learn everything mich easier, plus there is a lot of documentation
[01:09:54] <Satin> nice to hear :)
[01:10:18] <Satin> HeTo: lol I feel like switching to trying to make a GTK+ interface with C instead
[01:10:37] <Berlin36> and now i want to make a cryptography  library with go that will contain some badic algorithms
[01:10:39] <Satin> I understand that GTK on windows kinda iffy though
[01:10:45] <Satin> Berlin36: sounds good
[01:11:17] <Berlin36> i'll start with caesar's cipher, i've done it in c++ already a while ago
[01:11:24] <Satin> :o 
[01:11:28] <Berlin36> and then i'll move on to harder and harder stufd
[01:11:31] <Berlin36> i hope
[01:11:38] <HeTo> Satin: if you insist on sticking with C then GTK+ is a better (more viable) option indeed
[01:12:20] <Satin> Yeah, I'm starting to be afraid if I stick with Qt, there will be things i don't really understand
[01:12:37] <Berlin36> gui sucks
[01:12:38] <Satin> and I don't like bulshitting my way too much
[01:12:48] <Satin> this isn't a school project
[01:12:54] <Satin> i want to understand what i'm doing but not rly do C++ lol
[01:13:03] <Berlin36> yeah, i can relate
[01:13:32] <Berlin36> i mean i loved c++ a lot, but it is just not beginner friendly
[01:13:54] <Berlin36> i know all the basic stuff, but even like that, i can't do more advanced stuff
[01:14:15] <Satin> i see i see
[01:14:16] <Satin> yeah
[01:14:23] <Satin> i'd like to get a stronger grasp on C before I do C++ stuff
[01:14:24] <HeTo> Satin: that said, Qt Quick is QML, not C++. when getting started making Qt GUIs, you'd learn QML first before having to touch any C++

[01:15:01] <Satin> lmao

[01:15:20] <Berlin36> i kind of want to learn low level stuff, but i feel like i should do some basic programming before that
[01:15:31] <JesseDesu> i dont know how to program
[01:15:39] <JesseDesu> why am i even on libera
[01:15:40] <Satin> I'm the opposite way around, my university somewhat throwing me into the low level stuff first
[01:15:42] <Satin> in a sense
[01:15:45] <Satin> JesseDesu: neither do I?
[01:15:51] <ButterNoodle> yea JesseDesu efnet is better
[01:15:55] <Satin> I have written 0 complex or advanced programs
[01:15:56] <Satin> ButterNoodle: LOl
[01:16:02] <JesseDesu> i should be in rizon or something
[01:16:05] <Satin> JesseDesu: it's ok not to be a programmer
[01:16:06] <Satin> no you'
[01:16:08] <Satin> you're fine
[01:16:12] <ButterNoodle> just said efnet
[01:16:14] <ButterNoodle> ..
[01:16:20] <Berlin36> i think I'll do that cryptography lib
[01:16:21] <JesseDesu> whats efnet
[01:16:24] <Berlin36> what should it include?
[01:16:25] <Satin> an irc network
[01:16:26] <JesseDesu> i've never been
[01:16:30] <Berlin36> like what algorithms
[01:16:32] <ButterNoodle> !g efnet
[01:16:34] <ImoutoBot> ButterNoodle: EFnet - The Original IRC Network <http://www.efnet.org/> | EFnet - Wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EFnet> | IRCHelp.org — EFNet Server List <https://www.irchelp.org/networks/efnet/servers.html>
[01:16:36] <JesseDesu> whats efnet like
[01:16:46] <Satin> idk anything about cryptography tbh
[01:16:48] <HeTo> Satin: sort of, but it combines JavaScript so that you don't have to write the code separately, you can do simple stuff like foo.something ? x.bar : y.other right in a property assignment, and not only that, it'll automatically change the value of the property you're assigning to if any of the inputs change
[01:16:48] <Berlin36> i was thinking of making a base64 algorithm too, maybe some hashes
[01:17:03] <Satin> HeTo:  ooh i see
[01:17:08] <Berlin36> then move on to rsa and simillar stuff
[01:17:12] <HeTo> Satin: and syntactically it's a lot like CSS IMO
[01:17:39] <JesseDesu> what is efnet geared towards
[01:17:51] <HeTo> although a big difference to CSS is that QML creates objects whereas CSS only assigns styles to objects that are created elsewhere
[01:18:45] <Berlin36> and another thing i absolutely adore in Golang is that it can return multiple values from a function
[01:19:09] <Berlin36> this is very useful imo
[01:19:20] <Satin> wild
[01:19:35] <HeTo> Berlin36: like... tuples? or sum types? like any modern language has in one way or another
[01:19:41] <JesseDesu> wild thing
[01:19:46] <JesseDesu> you make my heart sing
[01:19:53] <Berlin36> nah, just different values
[01:20:03] <Berlin36> and when you declare a variable it will be like
[01:20:21] <Berlin36> value1, _, value3 = func()
[01:20:35] <HeTo> that's just a tuple and tuple unpacking
[01:20:44] <Berlin36> notice the underscore, it is used in case you don't need the value
[01:21:00] <Berlin36> idunno what's that, but it's very cool, HeTo 
[01:21:37] <HeTo> that code is valid Python except it actually assigns to a variable called _
[01:22:25] <HeTo> and apart from the underscore ignoring you can do similar stuff in C++ and numerous other languages as well

[01:27:37] <Satin> it's so straightforward, just include so and such library etc
[01:27:43] <HeTo> Satin: but if you go down the GTK+ and C path, you won't get away from OOP, you'll just be doing it all by hand
[01:27:51] <Satin> yeah LOL
[01:28:03] <Satin> but at least it will be in a language i understand ree
[01:28:05] <Satin> kind of
[01:28:32] <Satin> HeTo: when was object oriented programming even invented?
[01:28:42] <Satin> like C happened in the 70s I think
[01:29:03] <HeTo> languages with OOP support built in started appearing in the 80s, I think
[01:29:05] <Satin> when did someone decide "eh, we need to start having things like objects and classes"

[03:11:13] <analoq> i thought that happens only in porns :P

[03:12:25] <analoq> Satin: doesn't matter. what matters is his reach
[03:12:26] <ezekielnoob> photographers looking for free models and in return cosplayers get to have their photos
[03:12:34] <ezekielnoob> so both sides benefits

[03:14:15] <Satin> I don't think instagram is used by professional photographers as much
[03:14:15] <ezekielnoob> analoq nah, to be honest instagram is better... i just prefer flickr for image quality

[03:14:28] <Satin> from what I'm told by astrography friends

[03:14:31] <Satin> instagram is more social idk
[03:14:33] <Satin> o i see
[03:14:37] <ezekielnoob> but the quality is terrible
[03:14:42] <Satin> yeah lol
[03:14:49] <Satin> i guess they can always contact you
[03:14:51] <Satin> and pay you
[03:14:55] <Satin> for a bigger res
[03:14:58] <analoq> im just a little confused looking at that profile of yours. on one hand you put lots of effort into the pics, but then you dump them in a folder together with random room photos on flicker :D
[03:15:01] <ezekielnoob> i guess the thing about it is that, yes instagram image quality sucks. but if you have a good photo, it don't matter if the resolution is not that good
[03:15:11] <Satin> hmm i see

[04:24:13] <analoq> yeah the awkwardness on the first few sessions is probably unavoidable
[04:25:12] <analoq> do outdoor shootings in public work better for these?
[04:25:48] <ezekielnoob> well hmm maybe a bit
[04:25:57] <ezekielnoob> i personally prefer outdoors
[04:26:08] <ezekielnoob> there's just more 'interaction' you can do
[04:26:14] <ezekielnoob> rather than just standing in a plain background
[04:26:15] <ButterNoodle> outdoor light is hard tho
[04:26:33] <ezekielnoob> it is and sometimes it can offer to be better
[04:26:43] <ezekielnoob> that owuld be the photograher's problem
[04:27:12] <ezekielnoob> analoq to me expressions are even more vital for cosplay cause of the fact on how anime characters express themselves
[04:27:28] <ezekielnoob> it's always more over the top than typical media
[04:28:07] <analoq> i dont think the anime style works irl. which is imho why life action looks so cringy
[04:28:30] <analoq> i think expressions need to be normalized, but still enough to transport the message
[04:28:40] <ButterNoodle> the live action of inuyashiki was good
[04:29:16] <MootPoot> GODDAMN
[04:29:23] <ezekielnoob> analoq aha yeah that's true
[04:29:24] <MootPoot> I passed out at 6am

[04:32:17] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: tomako liked it. I am not such a fan of action tho like her

[06:35:47] <klaxa> i also used arch btw
[06:35:50] <klaxa> but not anymore
[06:36:04] <klaxa> i like non-breaking distros now
[06:36:29] <JesseDesu> my lubuntu broke after 2 solid years
[06:36:42] <MootPoot> My win10 install has never broken
[06:36:55] <Aurora_v_kosmose> I literally never had an unfixable break in a distro so far.
[06:36:56] <MootPoot> its been about  7 years I think
[06:37:14] <Aurora_v_kosmose> The worst I've had was grub not liking the removal of a hardware raid unit.
[06:37:21] <klaxa> yeah it's all fixable
[06:37:25] <MootPoot> (although I did basically refresh/fac reset the entire ssytem when I upgraded it to win10 pro from home )
[06:37:29] <klaxa> but it all is time consuming
[06:37:50] <klaxa> and i'd rather spend my time fapping then fixing X for the twelvehundredth time
[06:39:54] <emmeka> MootPoot Windows doesn't break, it just gradually melts into a pile of turtles that barely move
[06:40:16] <Aurora_v_kosmose> klaxa: X very rarely breaks, in my experience.
[06:40:19] <MootPoot> sounds like a shit computer problem emmeka 
[06:40:38] <MootPoot> I've had my ubuntu turn to garbage on craptops too
[06:40:46] <Aurora_v_kosmose> MootPoot: Not really, Microsoft decided to assume everyone had SDDs when they chose their new swapping patterns around W8~w10
[06:40:52] <Aurora_v_kosmose> *SSDs
[06:41:05] <Aurora_v_kosmose> They instantly nuked performance on a large swathe of their users.
[06:41:20] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Especially since Microsoft has no adjustable swappiness.
[06:41:33] <MootPoot> if you dont have a ssd at least in 2021, I'd pretty solidly put your system into the "crapbox" category unless for some reason you're running baller specs elsewhere
[06:42:01] <Aurora_v_kosmose> MootPoot: A 2010 machine with top spec at the time is perfectly serviceable now as a Linux computer.
[06:42:12] <Aurora_v_kosmose> It's not going to work for Windows.
[06:42:23] <Aurora_v_kosmose> I think it might even get "not supported" bullshit come W11
[06:42:31] <MootPoot> it will, not might 
[06:42:56] <MootPoot> but also your "perfectly servicable" linux computer is still a slow pile of shit
[06:43:04] <MootPoot> even if it can run linux 
[06:43:31] <Aurora_v_kosmose> MootPoot: I mean, my server is basically that old and runs perfectly fine as a VM & storage server.
[06:43:48] <emmeka> and yet, those "old piles of shit" run fine when you get rid of Windows
[06:43:50] <MootPoot> I'm only talking in context of desktop persnal use systems
[06:43:52] <emmeka> which was my point
[06:43:53] <Aurora_v_kosmose> (I did put an SSD but that's mostly because I had one lying around.)
[06:43:59] <MootPoot> not headless boxes
[06:43:59] <Aurora_v_kosmose> And there's emmeka's point

[06:45:10] <MootPoot> woah JesseDesu keep posting
[06:45:14] <emmeka> MootPoot I mean I have zero confidence in your ability to maintain a linux system after yesterday :P
[06:45:19] <Aurora_v_kosmose> MootPoot: The thing is that if the IO is the only thing that's slow, it shouldn't bog down your entire system.
[06:45:42] <JesseDesu> mootpoot you like dis shit dont you
[06:45:42] <MootPoot> emmeka: blame that on the debian image makers making the default package link to the install cd-rom
[06:45:46] <Aurora_v_kosmose> An i9 with a HDD should have adjustable swappiness and a lot of ram, such that the HDD & filesystem cache mean it wouldn't even matter you're using an HDD
[06:46:03] <Aurora_v_kosmose> So the problem is purely that Windows is badly designed.
[06:46:09] <emmeka> the main takeaway I got from yesterday was that I forgot how ugly apt actually looks compared to dnf
[06:46:43] <MootPoot> butter just pointed out the problem and told me to swap out the sources.list links with differnet links

[06:48:27] <ImoutoBot> JesseDesu: No more!
[06:48:44] <Aurora_v_kosmose> MootPoot: No, adjustable tendency to spend time moving old pages to and from memory & non-volatile memory.
[06:48:45] <JesseDesu> those are my top 3 favorite artists
[06:49:11] <Aurora_v_kosmose> MootPoot: Windows tends to eject pages way too much, meaning you have to fetch back from disk all the time
[06:49:25] *** Quits: redstarcomrade (uid99592@user/redstarcomrade) (Quit: Connection closed for inactivity)
[06:49:36] <Aurora_v_kosmose> You shouldn't be swapping at <50% RAM usage. And yet you are.
[06:50:17] <Matt|home> sigh... see that's my main/biggest issue by far with this show im watching. there is no genuinely good character >:\
[06:50:28] <MootPoot> Sure, I can get that they jumped the gun and made that change too fast Aurora_v_kosmose 
[06:50:37] <Aurora_v_kosmose> MootPoot: It's bad design all around.
[06:50:46] <Aurora_v_kosmose> MootPoot: There's no reason to swap without memory pressure.
[06:51:14] <Aurora_v_kosmose> And even with SSDs, only NVMe gets anywhere near fast-enough to say you "don't notice it much".
[06:51:48] <MootPoot> NVMe ssd's dont really command a price premium anymore ( unless you're looking for top shelf stuff ) over sata
[06:52:06] <MootPoot> but I see your point
[06:52:16] <MootPoot> RAM is made to be used 
[06:52:19] <Aurora_v_kosmose> You need top shelf stuff to get anywhere near RAM-level IO speeds
[06:52:52] <MootPoot> but this dosen't really get past the slow cpu problems for anything 10 years ago
[06:53:14] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Most of the time I find, with HDDs, the first bottleneck is IO.
[06:53:15] <MootPoot> sure if you're not doing much - go linux all day
[06:53:30] <MootPoot> but for actual desktop / workstation  use as a proper system
[06:53:37] <MootPoot> 10 year old system is a 10 year old system
[06:53:44] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Not swapping removes a lot of unnecessary IO bottlenecking.
[06:54:37] <tcsilver> like visual studio mootpoot?:-----D
[06:54:45] <tcsilver> do you like it ?
[06:54:52] <MootPoot> its pretty good , no complains
[06:55:01] <tcsilver> I like it too :)
[06:55:05] <MootPoot> 2022 ver is a buggy POS, give it a few weeks 
[06:55:15] <tcsilver> ah
[06:55:26] <tcsilver> I use 2015 and 2017
[06:55:28] <tcsilver> and 2012
[06:55:31] <tcsilver> and 2010
[06:55:42] <tcsilver> er something like that
[06:55:43] <tcsilver> :)
[06:56:03] <MootPoot> Aurora_v_kosmose: I do accept that linux takes less to run - but my caveat here is that I dont like it when its presented in a manner where "linux can breathe life into a old system"  - no, it just puts it on life support for a little bit longer
[06:56:46] <JesseDesu> i retired my 2008 macbook after i installed ubuntu mate on it
[06:56:53] <emmeka> isn't that two ways to say the same thing
[06:57:11] <MootPoot> the context /framing is different
[06:57:20] <Aurora_v_kosmose> It depends on your workloads a lot, and how often you're limited by single-core bottlenecks.
[06:57:31] <MootPoot> one is like rubbing a turd and saying "here's a gold bar!" 
[06:57:48] <MootPoot> the other one is saying "heres a turd, but heres a nose plug"
[06:58:35] *** Parts: tcsilver (~tcsilver@pool-96-255-128-204.washdc.fios.verizon.net) ()
[06:58:42] <Aurora_v_kosmose> For example, for mostly-idle containers and VMs, virtualization acceleration and sufficient ram matters a lot more than single-threaded speed & IO speed.
[06:58:54] <MootPoot> Agree
[06:59:13] <Aurora_v_kosmose> And you can use basically anything able to saturate a 1Gbps link for NAS.
[06:59:16] <MootPoot> But I did sayI was talking in the context of "desktop personal systems"
[06:59:24] <MootPoot> earlier
[07:00:06] <MootPoot> I've been trynig to figure out how to make one of those software defined cpu's on my FPGA 
[07:00:07] <Aurora_v_kosmose> I've tended to mothball my older systems into becoming servers in some manner or another.
[07:00:25] <MootPoot> same here - although because that's all they're good for anymore 
[07:00:30] <MootPoot> linux headless servers
[07:01:14] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Storage drivers always have to run on ECC though. Wouldn't want faulty ram nuking zfs/btrfs by running a scrub and "repairing" everything
[07:01:36] <MootPoot> did alder lake add ecc support
[07:01:43] <MootPoot> I forget
[07:01:48] <MootPoot> I know AM4 has it
[07:02:02] <Aurora_v_kosmose> No idea. Storage is the one thing I'm basically stuck with using old enterprise stuff for, for now at least.
[07:02:15] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Maybe DDR5's mandatory internal ECC will make full ECC support in general more popular.
[07:02:28] <Aurora_v_kosmose> I shoudl would like for something with a raspi-tier power draw to be usage as a storage driver.
[07:02:35] <Aurora_v_kosmose> *usable
[07:02:52] <MootPoot> I heard somebody say somewhere say that ddr5 onboard ecc is not "real" ecc
[07:02:59] <Aurora_v_kosmose> s/shoudl/sure/
[07:03:31] <Aurora_v_kosmose> MootPoot: It's internally ECC'd. The bus doesn't get any ECC signaling or messages, and can neither detect nor correct errors that happen can happen outside the ram chip.
[07:03:46] <Aurora_v_kosmose> *or can
[07:04:07] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Full ECC/real ECC requires an additional data line.
[07:04:26] <MootPoot> These is one thing that might work for that use case Aurora_v_kosmose I found recently

[07:09:10] <MootPoot> you meanted rpi and storage and I thought it was like some kind of beefier rpi NAS box
[07:09:53] <Aurora_v_kosmose> MootPoot: Yeah, in this case there's no real bottleneck annoying me, it's mostly the monthly energy bill that could stand to be lower. 
[07:10:17] <MootPoot> what on earth are you using right now that actually has a meaningful effect on your power bill
[07:10:18] <MootPoot> lol
[07:10:21] <Aurora_v_kosmose> I don't need a mostly idle machine to draw >45w
[07:10:29] <Aurora_v_kosmose> When it could draw a fifth of that easily.
[07:11:15] <Aurora_v_kosmose> And it's a bit like everything else. A 4$ sandwhich every morning adds up after a year.
[07:11:18] <Aurora_v_kosmose> *sandwich
[07:11:43] <Aurora_v_kosmose> It adds up even more when it means you have to air-condition more in summer.
[07:11:55] <MootPoot> you dont just spread out your computers?
[07:12:29] <Aurora_v_kosmose> MootPoot: That doesn't change the need to air condition. Heat has an annoying tendency to spread.
[07:12:40] <Aurora_v_kosmose> And it's a lot more expensive to AC than to heat.
[07:12:45] <MootPoot> no I mean like

[09:08:12] <Satin> like they're not neccessarily wrong but then they play it up and make me feel like they think other fields are below them, and only mathematics and physics reign supreme
[09:08:30] <Satin> Fuckers. In my opinion Biology is studying more complex phenomona of this world and so on
[09:08:37] <Urchin[emacs]> I'm really inclined to tell a joke about the fields
[09:08:39] <Satin> and even CS is probably harder at the appropriate levels
[09:08:44] <Urchin[emacs]> I forgot the full chain

[09:10:16] <Satin> > Macroscopic systems that contain huge numbers of particles manifest ‘emergent’ properties that are best understood in terms of new, irreducible concepts appropriate to the level of the system. Valency, gastrulation (when cells begin to differentiate in embryonic development), imprinting, and natural selection are all examples. Even a phenomenon as unmysterious as the flow of water in pipes or rivers is better understood in terms of 
[09:10:16] <Satin> viscosity and turbulence, rather than atom-by-atom interactions. Specialists in fluid mechanics don’t care that water is made up of H2O molecules; they can understand how waves break and what makes a stream turn choppy only because they envisage liquid as a continuum.
[09:10:21] <Urchin[emacs]> geographers think they're geologists, geologists think they're ... something something ... think they're biologists, biologists think they're chemists, chemists think they're physicists, physicists think they're gods, gods think they're mathematicians

[09:10:31] <Satin> Lol yeah
[09:10:57] <Satin> I mean it makes me motivated to dabble in mathematics, i don't know for what end reason

[09:12:40] <Satin> i can imagine lol
[09:12:43] <Urchin[emacs]> Satin: but then, in my uni, our easy stuff is your hardcore stuff on hard mode
[09:12:52] <Satin> possibly
[09:13:05] <Satin> my school is one of the "hard STEM schools" in this country
[09:13:08] <Satin> not ivy league tho
[09:13:16] <Satin> and probably not that hard on undergrad
[09:13:33] <Urchin[emacs]> Satin: like, I bumped into a guy going over a 3rd year uni math book on youtube, and he gets into a proof, and it's the easy version of the stuff I did on first year
[09:13:44] <Satin> yeah
[09:13:49] <Satin> american schools are a bit like that sometimes
[09:13:54] <Satin> learning calculus in freshman college
[09:14:01] <Satin> while other countries might start at 15 years old
[09:14:09] <Satin> but all in all, we get there eventually :)
[09:14:12] <Satin> just a bit later
[09:14:24] <Urchin[emacs]> Satin: eh, I only started with calculus in uni
[09:14:44] <Satin> a lot of indians and chinese start in hs with sthat stuff
[09:14:45] <Urchin[emacs]> Satin: scrach that, I started straight with real analysis in uni
[09:15:02] <Satin> wild
[09:15:07] <Urchin[emacs]> Satin: we're still a bit of a traditional geometrist holdout country
[09:15:14] <Satin> lol
[09:15:19] <Satin> idk what that implies
[09:15:26] <Satin> i know that real analysis is calculus but rigid
[09:15:28] <Urchin[emacs]> that we do a lot of geometry
[09:15:34] <Satin> ew
[09:15:43] <Urchin[emacs]> including stuff you'd have problems with
[09:15:48] <Satin> .-.
[09:15:52] <Satin> i don't like no geometry
[09:16:03] <Urchin[emacs]> geometry was the basis of mathematics for couple thousand years
[09:16:09] <Satin> ugh
[09:16:42] <amigojapan> Trig is useful for making games
[09:16:43] <Urchin[emacs]> it was only in late 19th century, IIRC, that formalists started really taking over
[09:16:53] <Satin> tbh i need a way to connect those two to be motivated
[09:16:59] <Satin> connect programming and math
[09:17:11] <Satin> otherwise just learning math feels so pointless and useless to try to go any further than school stuff
[09:17:21] <amigojapan> Satin: trig, really useful for games
[09:17:28] <Satin> yeah i can imagine for graphics
[09:17:35] <amigojapan> Yup
[09:17:43] <Satin> Urchin[emacs]:  how much programming do you need to know to start touching haskell
[09:17:43] <Satin> lol
[09:17:51] <amigojapan> Satin: make the game asteroids
[09:18:19] <Urchin[emacs]> Satin: Haskell is a beast that's based on an attempt to redefine the foundations of mathematics
[09:18:21] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Satin: I'd say you'll probably have a much easier time if you're familiar with ML languages.
[09:18:31] <Aurora_v_kosmose> But you can just learn it on its own.
[09:18:37] <amigojapan> Satin: Haskell is a different paradigm and has little to do with other programming
[09:19:15] <Urchin[emacs]> Satin: currently, the basis of mathematics is Zermelo-Frankel's set theory with the axiom of choice expressed in first order logic
[09:19:35] <Urchin[emacs]> Satin: Haskell tries out new branches of logic
[09:19:59] <Urchin[emacs]> Satin: but, usually, you don't need to know that for simple stuff
[09:20:14] <amigojapan> Satin: also I don't think you will be making games or programming micro controllers in Haskell
[09:20:19] <Aurora_v_kosmose> You don't need to know most of that stuff for most things.
[09:20:19] <Satin> dude i learnt a very small bit of set theory
[09:20:24] <Satin> and it made understanding functions and stuff
[09:20:26] <Urchin[emacs]> and expect almost everything you may want to do to fall under simple stuff
[09:20:26] <Satin> finally make sense
[09:20:34] <Satin> i learned very little tho on my own

[09:21:24] <Satin> interesting
[09:21:30] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Learning Scheme is what made functions and stuff actually make sense for me.
[09:21:37] <amigojapan> Alright Aurora_v_kosmose 
[09:21:43] <Aurora_v_kosmose> In an abstract rather than "I know this specific instance" way.
[09:22:09] <Aurora_v_kosmose> There's also MicroPython which Libre-SOC is using.
[09:22:25] <Aurora_v_kosmose> iirc
[09:22:28] <amigojapan> Aurora_v_kosmose: seeing the debugger in Dr racket makes recursion more clear
[09:23:14] <amigojapan> Aurora_v_kosmose: it shows the entire history of the stack 
[09:23:21] <Urchin[emacs]> !later tell tsunderenoises https://i.redd.it/0ju03w7jciz71.jpg
[09:23:25] <Aurora_v_kosmose> amigojapan: Oddly I originally had a lot more trouble with the notion of first-class functions because the languages I'd learned before dealt stupidly badly with the notion.
[09:23:44] <amigojapan> I see Aurora_v_kosmose 
[09:24:05] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Recursion was helped a lot by the named-let in Scheme for me.
[09:24:13] <amigojapan> Ok I gotta get ready for about an hour work, be back soon
[09:24:17] <Urchin[emacs]> Aurora_v_kosmose: I was like, I don't need function pointers, cool!
[09:24:20] <Aurora_v_kosmose> It... actually took me a while to realize Scheme actually had mutable variables.
[09:24:32] <Aurora_v_kosmose> So my earlier scripts are purely functional.
[09:25:12] <Urchin[emacs]> lol
[09:26:36] <Satin> where does philosophy stand
[09:26:40] <Satin> in the fields earlier
[09:26:42] <Satin> or is that just about scientists
[09:27:03] <Satin> philosophers would argue that philosophy comes up with the "concepts"that science measures
[09:27:09] <Satin> to quantify and understand the world in the first place
[09:27:30] <Satin> you can't measure the distance between the earth and the sun if you can't comphrend what a star is, and categorize it as a concept, and so on and so forth
[09:27:43] <Satin> there's a reason why the "philosophy of science" and "philsophy of x field" exists
[09:28:28] <Urchin[emacs]> Satin: concepts of reality are not strictly philosophical, and you can't get them simply out of philosophy
[09:28:40] <Satin> of course, but they're intertwined often with it
[09:28:45] <Satin> it's like the meta thing
[09:28:53] <Urchin[emacs]> Satin: when dealing with reality, you have to look at reality, often with sensors and stuff
[09:29:07] <Satin> yes, but what you pick up with those sensors
[09:29:10] <Satin> how you interpret that
[09:29:16] <Urchin[emacs]> Satin: I'd call science a proper subset of philosophy, if that helps
[09:29:16] <Satin> would arguably fall down to philosophy as well
[09:29:20] <Satin> yeah
[09:29:25] <Satin> in a way maybe
[09:32:23] <JesseDesu> i'm back
[09:32:28] <Urchin[emacs]> in a way, I'd call physics the art of ignoring the irrelevant
[09:33:06] <JesseDesu> whoa i sneezed 3 times
[09:33:53] <Satin> it's just that people need to not become reductive either
[09:34:17] <Satin> not everything can be explanined by some fundamental "reductive" explaination of what reality is like
[09:34:30] <Satin> different abstractions
[09:34:33] <Satin> different levels

[11:39:33] <HubertFarnsworth> MootPoot: what projects are you on?
[11:39:46] <MootPoot> business process automation
[11:39:54] <MootPoot> taking away jobs from clerks 
[11:39:55] <MootPoot> etc
[11:40:37] <HubertFarnsworth> I mean you said it is taking up space
[11:40:44] <MootPoot> oh
[11:40:48] <MootPoot> I thought you meant my work projects
[11:40:50] <MootPoot> lmao
[11:40:58] <MootPoot> oh no for me I have like
[11:41:13] <MootPoot> my main pc setup and electronics setup in my room
[11:41:21] <MootPoot> and then I have another rigup in the garage
[11:41:29] <MootPoot> problem is too cold down there 
[11:41:43] <HubertFarnsworth> nice, what kind of rigup?
[11:41:58] <MootPoot> two tables, 3d printer, tabletop CNC machine
[11:42:05] <MootPoot> and a simple workbench
[11:42:12] <MootPoot> hand tools etc
[11:42:19] <MootPoot> a few computers
[11:42:55] <DunceCotus> clerx
[11:44:06] <HubertFarnsworth> nice
[11:44:34] <MootPoot> am I addicted
[11:44:39] <HubertFarnsworth> no
[11:44:48] <MootPoot> my headache went away when I started drinking monster energy
[11:44:59] <MootPoot> I want a fucking warehouse for my stuff
[11:45:03] <HubertFarnsworth> MootPoot: you have interests which is very good
[11:45:19] <MootPoot> best I got is a bedroom and a single car garage
[11:45:22] <HubertFarnsworth> MootPoot: people these days are fucking lazy and have no interests or passions
[11:45:44] <MootPoot> the amount of shit I could do if somebody just gave me like
[11:45:47] <MootPoot> 10k dollars
[11:45:57] <MootPoot> forget about bling
[11:46:02] <MootPoot> its time to make my robot army
[11:46:40] <HubertFarnsworth> patience man, you're still studying, aren't you? once you graduate, I bet you'd get a good job and eventually make a lot more money
[11:46:41] <beaky> factorio in real life
[11:47:31] <MootPoot> I graduate in december
[11:47:58] <MootPoot> but I wont be making 'real' money for a while
[11:48:30] <HubertFarnsworth> student loan?
[11:48:42] <MootPoot> that, although its not too much
[11:48:54] <MootPoot> 6k - aiming to half that by end of this year
[11:49:39] <MootPoot> but mainly I'm employed as an intern
[11:49:50] <MootPoot> until like either the end of jan or mid of next year
[11:49:52] <MootPoot> so
[11:50:02] <MootPoot> I'll be making intern level money as well
[11:50:04] <MootPoot> you know how it works
[11:50:20] <HubertFarnsworth> yeah
[11:50:34] <MootPoot> Well, I am making intern level money anyways
[11:50:40] <MootPoot> like 2200 / mo
[11:50:50] <MootPoot> out of which half goes to bills , ffood etc
[11:50:58] <MootPoot> other half goes to loan

[12:03:26] <MootPoot> okay, wow
[12:03:30] <MootPoot> so apparetly
[12:03:45] <MootPoot> airpods work with android phone, work with iphone, dont work with macbook air
[12:03:51] <MootPoot> so the problem must be with the air right?
[12:04:05] <MootPoot> except my sony headphones also work with all three of them
[12:04:17] <MootPoot> something is fucky in the airpod-macbook link

[12:07:53] <MootPoot> atomic pi
[12:08:04] <MootPoot> has a quad core 14nm intel atom - cherry trail
[12:08:10] <MootPoot> ~40 usd
[12:09:01] <amigojapan> Nice MootPoot 
[12:09:15] <HubertFarnsworth> it's alright amigojapan

[12:09:29] <amigojapan> MootPoot: does it have gpio?
[12:09:40] <amigojapan> Ty HubertFarnsworth 
[12:10:06] <MootPoot> it does have GPIO but not much - but that's not a problem anywya
[12:10:12] <MootPoot> just plug in a rpi pico into it

[12:11:57] <amigojapan> MootPoot: I am not sure about Pico but the gpio pins of the Arduino are much more capable than the ones in the real RPI.it has like 5 hardware analog read/write pins
[12:12:58] <MootPoot> afaik as long as you have a usb connected, you should be able to control the pins on a arduino from a linux board easy
[12:13:08] <MootPoot> over serial usb connection
[12:13:29] <amigojapan> Yeah
[12:16:49] <hassoon> dooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooods
[12:16:49] <MootPoot> but anyways, for the price its really good
[12:17:06] <MootPoot> 40 usd for something thats like 2x as powerful as a rpi4
[12:19:49] <hassoon> MootPoot: wa(r yo doin'
[12:19:52] <hassoon> wa'r *
[12:19:55] <MootPoot> weeb
[12:20:26] <amigojapan> MootPoot: but both Arduino and RPI have more active communities than a third party option so I don't think I would buy it
[12:20:40] <amigojapan> MootPoot: power is not everything
[12:20:49] <MootPoot> why do you need a more active community?
[12:21:09] <amigojapan> Cause they produce interesting libraries
[12:21:10] <MootPoot> as long as it can run a stable OS and has periphrals you can access
[12:21:23] <MootPoot> you should be able to just run those libraries on anything you want really

[12:21:52] <amigojapan> No they would be incompatible
[12:22:08] <MootPoot> a tool meant to run on raspbian cant be just compiled for x86 and run on any other linux box?
[12:22:32] <MootPoot> adruino sure, since it dosen't have the same pinouts and microcontrollrs are too different
[12:22:52] <amigojapan> Usually yes, unless there is a hardware difference and when it comes to gpio there is
[12:23:15] <MootPoot> yeah but its just gpio - chaning the gpio pin # should be a really easy task for someone like you
[12:23:21] <MootPoot> especially if you have the source code

[12:23:59] <MootPoot> why
[12:24:09] <MootPoot> I've done it on my stuff
[12:24:33] <amigojapan> Cause pinouts are complex. Not every pin has the same functionality
[12:25:06] *** Joins: LucaTM (~LucaTM@user/lucatm)
[12:25:08] <MootPoot> do you not have a breadboard and some dupont connector wires?
[12:25:17] <amigojapan> It would need to port the library
[12:25:39] <amigojapan> That is not the point
[12:26:35] <HubertFarnsworth> It’s difficult when one is using special functions of gpio amigojapan otherwise it’s just plain gpio
[12:27:17] <MootPoot> I've done it when porting stuff for raspi to run on my orange pi - which has a different gpio layout
[12:27:28] <amigojapan> HubertFarnsworth: he is taking about putting a library designed for rpi on another board

[12:28:11] <HubertFarnsworth> I’m not sure then. It depends on the kind of library, what it hardware features it uses and such.
[12:28:11] <JesseDesu> i cleaned up the hair
[12:28:15] <JesseDesu> what a nightmare
[12:28:38] <HubertFarnsworth> amigojapan: if all it needs is just plain gpio and processing power, then it’s fine.
[12:28:57] <MootPoot> HubertFarnsworth: for the few times I've done it, it was just a matter of editing the designated gpio the program uses
[12:29:12] <MootPoot> in the start
[12:29:19] <HubertFarnsworth> MootPoot: yeah, those cases are fine.
[12:30:43] <MootPoot> maybe in some fancy cases, I dont know 
[12:30:52] <MootPoot> but for me its been realtively simple
[12:31:20] <HubertFarnsworth> I don’t know how fine it would be to run those libraries on something so weak like atmega controllers, heh
[12:31:40] <MootPoot> lol
[12:31:42] <HubertFarnsworth> These are just 8bit MC
[12:32:02] <HubertFarnsworth> Teeny tiny memories and processing power.
[12:32:13] <MootPoot> yeah but what I was saying is that there is a different SBC called an atomic pi , 40 bucks but it gets you a quad core intel atom on 14nm , much more powerful then the rpi4
[12:32:18] <MootPoot> it has gpio as well
[12:32:31] <MootPoot> so you could just run linux on there and edit the pins in your app
[12:32:36] <MootPoot> if you wanted to
[12:32:56] <HubertFarnsworth> Nice.
[12:33:21] <MootPoot> a quad core x86 14nm cherry trail atom blows the rpi chip out of the water
[12:33:28] <HubertFarnsworth> MootPoot: why don’t you mess with fpga, I find those are more fun.
[12:33:29] <MootPoot> in terms of capability
[12:33:38] <MootPoot> HubertFarnsworth: I have one or two
[12:33:39] <HubertFarnsworth> Damn
[12:33:51] <HubertFarnsworth> A quad core? Lol
[12:33:55] <MootPoot> I haven't gotten into it yet, busy with other side projects atm
[12:33:56] <amigojapan> I mean libraries like wiringpi

[12:34:25] <HubertFarnsworth> So much processing power!
[12:34:39] <MootPoot> HubertFarnsworth: I mean the pi is also a quad but compared to a intel atom even...the pi dosen't stand a chance
[12:34:42] <MootPoot> and its so cheap as well 
[12:34:45] <MootPoot> 40 usd
[12:36:03] <HubertFarnsworth> Sometimes I find it mind boggling seeing so much processing power in embedded systems. Back in my day 32 bit risc at91sam are like fancy thing.
[12:37:06] <HubertFarnsworth> MootPoot: I was so stupid back then that I used to write my own libraries. Refused to use others.
[12:37:22] <MootPoot> I still to this day I dont know why the arduino people use usb B on some of their boards
[12:37:24] <amigojapan> HubertFarnsworth: I still prefer the simple ones like Arduino for most tasks
[12:37:30] <MootPoot> lol HubertFarnsworth

[12:59:29] <HubertFarnsworth> No way that can be C++ Berlin36. C++ is still used a lot, I mean really really lot. So many solutions to  problems in C++.

[13:00:58] <HubertFarnsworth> Berlin36: btw, why don’t you try MIT’s sicp course? It’s free.

[13:02:07] <Berlin36> oh, ill look at it later today
[13:02:17] <HubertFarnsworth> Berlin36: you’ll learn the elements of programming in general, concepts and such
[13:02:47] <Satin> what languages do they use
[13:02:50] <Satin> if they use python i'm not interested
[13:02:53] <HubertFarnsworth> You learn them with scheme but what’s important are those concepts
[13:03:01] <Berlin36> well i kind of already know the basic stuff
[13:03:03] <HubertFarnsworth> Satin: scheme, lisp based
[13:03:12] <Satin> what are the prerewuistes
[13:03:52] <HubertFarnsworth> Satin: nothing, anyone with minimal knowledge is good

[18:34:36] <Sadale> other dumb IoT clocks would wrap back to 1900 after 2036. Mine'd keep working on and on and on until it reached Y9999, which the 4-digit display wouldn't be able to show the year by then. :3
[18:34:51] <Sadale> s/reached/reaches/
[18:35:09] <darkwitch> at that time, no one will have a need for time any more

[18:36:09] <MootPoot> I'd imagine people on other planets would still use earth time
[18:36:28] <MootPoot> since we still need to sleep wake according to the daylight hours on earth courtesty of evolution
[18:36:42] <MootPoot> unless it turns into a gundam situation lol
[18:36:46] <Sadale> The problem is that the number of hours per day of other planets are different from earth
[18:37:12] <MootPoot> I know, but our sleep/wake requirements are in tune with earth

[20:15:20] <SummerSkies> I'm about to watch Demon Slayer for the first time tomrrow
[20:15:35] <emmeka> It's pretty good.

[20:17:28] <emmeka> yes, they're a pretty renowned studio for action series.
[20:17:35] <emmeka> Demon Slayer would've been way better without Zenitsu shouting constantly, though
[20:18:07] <emmeka> I'd be tempted to retry it with the dub, that's out now, because dubs tend to solve shouty male characters and tone them down for anglophone audiences
