[15:05:41] <artchad> yo, borodust. I've encountered an interesting issue while trying to load :trivial-gamekit on alpine linux.
[15:06:29] <artchad> Unable to load foreign library (LIBGLFW.SO.BODGED-747). Error opening shared object "/home/user/quicklisp/dists/org.borodust.bodge/software/glfw-blob-20200824142326/x86_64/libglfw.so.bodged": Error relocating /home/user/quicklisp/dists/org.borodust.bodge/software/glfw-blob-20200824142326/x86_64/libglfw.so.bodged: __snprintf_chk: symbol not found.
[15:07:49] <artchad> it said something about not being able to open some special file because of nouveau or so.
[15:08:49] <artchad> nvidia...
[15:10:33] <artchad> I guess trivial-gamekit is not meant to be run in exotic places with exotic hardware.
[15:10:35] <artchad> xD
[15:14:04] <borodust> artchad: it won't work on alpine
[15:14:17] <borodust> gamekit needs glibc
[15:14:23] <borodust> on linux systems
[15:15:41] <borodust> artchad: gamekit is built to run on smth popular like ubuntu 2018+ and similar systems
[15:15:55] <borodust> it assumes glibc and X server
[15:17:52] <artchad> I've already installed glibc in addition. I also got an X server running. It's some DRM related stuff. Maybe I could get it to work if I knew how to configure X properly.
[15:18:05] <artchad> I'm already happy that I got an Xorg server running as a regular user. :D
[15:18:17] <artchad> btw. I'm learning cffi. right now.
[15:18:32] <artchad> I want to write my own OpenGL bindings as practice. It's really not all that hard.
[15:18:37] <artchad> it's just a bit of work.
[15:19:35] <artchad> or my own cffi, the manual makes a distinction between "bindings" and an "ffi".

[22:58:52] <jstoddard> Since I'm not writing my own tile editor this weekend, does anyone here use cl-tiled?
[23:00:58] <jstoddard> I've been playing around with it this morning, but have had to make some tweaks to stop it from choking on maps with object layers.
[23:01:30] <jstoddard> It's still choking for other reasons in CCL, which I want to look into later, but for now I have it reading my test maps in SBCL alright.
[23:02:10] <jstoddard> I'm wondering if my experience is on par with others', or if it's working right out of the box for other people.
