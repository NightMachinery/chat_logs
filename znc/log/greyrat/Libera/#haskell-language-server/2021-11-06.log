[15:04:38] <jneira[m]> dont know about a concrete problem, only looks like a hack 
[15:05:47] <jneira[m]> it was considered here and it seems to have some problem? https://github.com/haskell/hie-bios/pull/282#issuecomment-864060085

[15:19:24] <fendor[m]> wz1000: Agree with  jneira, can't remember whether there was a real issue, but since semantics of `cabal exec` are weird and feel like a hack,  we didn't opt for it yet
[15:19:48] <wz1000> seems quite reasonable to me
[15:23:32] <fendor[m]> Just tested it in a project of mine and it failed immediately
[15:23:53] <wz1000> I think you need to run cabal configure first
[15:24:08] <fendor[m]> guess you have to call `cabal build --only-configure` first
[15:26:00] <jneira[m]> just tried `cabal configure` and did not work :-(
[15:26:26] <wz1000> what did not work?
[15:26:43] <fendor[m]> matrix client is so weirdly slow. On Hexchat, zubin wrote in between my messages but the timestamp is earlier than my last message
[15:26:48] <jneira[m]> well id will be supurseded by cabal s-b-i no?
[15:27:17] <fendor[m]> cabal s-b-i is currently not a great solution to find the project ghc
[15:27:30] <jneira[m]> wz1000: `cabal configure; cabal exec ghc -- -e 'System.Environment.getExecutablePath'` does not work
[15:27:42] <wz1000> how does it fail?
[15:27:49] <jneira[m]> with the same error
[15:28:00] <fendor> jneira[m], same behaviour with `cabal build --only-configure`?
[15:28:40] <jneira[m]> jneira[m]: `ghc.exe: can't find a package database at D:\dev\ws\haskell\hie-bios\dist-newstyle\packagedb\ghc-9.0.1`
[15:29:25] <jneira[m]> so it will need `dry-run`
[15:29:47] <jneira[m]> still dont know (or dont remeber) what exactly does any of those
[15:29:48] <fendor> `cabal build --dry-run` works?

[15:30:06] <jneira[m]> s/`/`?/
[15:30:29] <jneira[m]> it seem it works
[15:30:33] <jneira[m]> will double check
[15:31:19] <jneira[m]> nope, i did a --only-configure and no cleaned it 
[15:31:38] <jneira[m]> but only-configure build deps, no?
