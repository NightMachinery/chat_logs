[00:01:06] <EvanR> the part about 2D (sighted) vs 1D (blind) UI makes me think of zippers for some reason
[00:02:00] <f-a> mhhh how so
[00:02:21] <f-a> zippers on what, too :P on a list, on a tre
[00:02:34] <EvanR> anything
[00:03:20] <EvanR> ok, maybe it's not 1D, more like focus oriented
[00:03:35] <EvanR> like playing zork but any given room is 1 sentence or 1 word long
[00:03:49] <f-a> focus oriented is an excellent definition
[00:04:57] <EvanR> exits up front or at the end might be worse than distributed into the description
[00:05:09] <EvanR> (I have no idea how blind people use a computer)
[00:06:32] <f-a> why do you say worse?
[00:07:03] <f-a> if there is a way to skip paragraphs (screen readers have), it seems ok
[00:07:23] <EvanR> ok nvm
[00:07:40] <EvanR> it's definitely worse in a normal web page to put all the hyperlinks at the end 
[00:07:47] <f-a> yeah
[01:37:36] <EvanR> here's some numeralology https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/710644130048639066/939277452226723960/numerals.jpg
[01:43:03] <ManofLetters[m]> prime numbers have it rough
[01:46:28] <EvanR> can you think of what to use for 13
[02:03:48] <ManofLetters[m]> diamond?
[02:06:35] <EvanR> what kind of diamond
[02:19:43] <ManofLetters[m]> as in hearts, diamonds, clubs and the fourth
[02:20:15] <EvanR> ah cool
[02:20:35] <EvanR> 13 in cards would be Ace
[02:21:30] <EvanR> associated with spades, which is at least not a letter

[07:31:22] <EvanR> ManofLetters[m], thought you might like to see what "a diamond" looks like among the rogue's gallery https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/669294558072274955/939369920582549624/unknown.png
[07:32:28] <sm> pretty!
[07:37:00] <EvanR> actually, 12 hogs less if you use squares https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/669294558072274955/939371375393636412/unknown.png
[07:37:32] <EvanR> horray no real pattern

[07:46:52] <EvanR> damn that diamond was a good idea
[08:58:50] *** Joins: ardell (~ardell@user/ardell)
[09:38:53] <f-a> that is quite pretty EvanR 
[09:39:17] <f-a> and yeah unfortunately you would need an infinite supply of symbols ;_;
[09:39:56] <f-a> I prefer the diamond too
[09:40:21] <EvanR> it doesn't have much to do with the number 13 but what does really
[09:41:53] <f-a> is 14−1 doable in this system?
[09:41:57] <f-a> 7*2−1
[09:42:14] <EvanR> it's a bit of a stretch xD
[09:42:38] <f-a> what is this for EvanR 
[09:42:43] <EvanR> no idea
[09:42:53] <EvanR> we'll see tomorrow maybe
[09:42:53] <f-a> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/669294558072274955/939369920582549624/unknown.png ← EU flag v2.0
[09:43:16] <EvanR> bizarro EU
