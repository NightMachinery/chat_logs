[12:09:13] <Guest45> hey guys, how do i manage the situation where many different schemas might have 1 or many images associated with them?
[12:09:50] *** Joins: andrhua (~andrhua@31.134.187.8)
[12:11:13] <serafeim> Guest45: what exaclty is the problem
[12:11:15] <Guest45> I want to use a single Image schema (with a url field), but how do i index these images on FKs? for example say i have a Product schema where each product might have many images, and my User schema has a `field profile, :string` field
[12:11:20] <Guest45> ^
[12:12:27] <Guest45> with this approach, i'm not able to create an index on the product (via `product_id`)
[12:12:59] <Guest45> or should i just add a column for each schema that need to use images
[12:13:05] <Nicd> with a regular belongs_to or has_many or many_to_many association?
[12:13:30] <Guest45> i.e. Image{url: string, product_id: int, user_id: int, ...} etc
[12:14:06] <Guest45> Nicd: that wouldn't let create indexes for the different relations though right?
[12:14:15] <Nicd> it would
[12:15:04] <Guest45> Nicd: assuming i add a column for type of schema that could use images you mean?
[12:15:25] <Guest45> *for each type
[12:16:21] <Nicd> well I don't know your DB structure but a product would `has_many :images, Image` and image would probably have `belongs_to :product, Product` (unless the relation is many-to-many)
[12:19:45] <Guest45> Nicd: and image would need a `product_id` field for that to work, correct?
[12:20:18] <Nicd> yes, and there you can create an index with the foreign key
[12:22:39] <Guest45> Nicd: ok cool, thank you

[13:36:05] <Guest45> is it possible to pass some images to a controller (done this part) and then upload those images via waffle? (https://hexdocs.pm/waffle/)
[13:36:47] <Guest45> i've matched the "files" from params, but i'mt not quite sure what i need to do after that
[13:38:00] <Guest45> using the example they use, would i do something like `changeset = User.changeset(%User{}, %{avatar: file}`?

[13:48:52] <Guest45> also is it possible for "belongs_to" fields to be null?
[13:49:21] <Guest45> dumb question, that's the default
[13:49:22] <Nicd> yes
[13:52:22] <Guest45> Nicd: if i created a table with `mix phx.gen.context Photos Photo photo uuid:uuid`, but forgot to set primary_key: true, is it still possible to do this?
[13:52:52] <Guest45> i tried doing it in another migration, but ecto said that a primary key column already exists
[13:53:01] <Nicd> tried doing what?
[13:53:22] <Nicd> apparently you already have a primary key, use psql or the equivalent of your db to inspect the table structure
[13:53:41] <Guest45> `alter table(:photos) do\n modify :uuid, :uuid, primary_key: true\n end`
[13:54:00] <serafeim> hey do you know if the github copilot supports elixir ?
[13:54:10] <Nicd> I think you have the default primary key field called "id" already there, you'd need to remove it
[13:54:14] <Nicd> serafeim: yes
[13:54:36] <serafeim> so something's fishy with my vs code config :(
[13:54:39] <Nicd> I haven't used it but I've seen snippets from other people
[13:56:04] <serafeim> uh oh. i've got a file named Thumbnailer.ex that defines a Thumbnailer module. is the fact that I named my file Thumbnailer.ex instead of thumbnailer.ex problematic ?
[13:56:28] <Nicd> it shouldn't matter
[13:56:51] <Nicd> Phoenix wants some certain naming for controller/view/template files but Elixir doesn't care
[13:57:28] <serafeim> Nicd: ah ok cool thanks
[13:57:41] <serafeim> because renaming Thumbnailer to thumbnailer in widnows is problematic 
[13:59:11] <Guest45> Nicd: thanks, that seemed to work, although i get `** (Postgrex.Error) ERROR 42703 (undefined_column) column i0.id does not exist` when trying to use `Photos.list_photos()` in iex now
[13:59:37] <Nicd> it's assuming you have an id column. did you change your schema to match?
[13:59:38] <Guest45> (and there's no `id` field in my Photo.ex schema)
[14:00:47] <Norrland> serafeim: the filename should not matter? You could have "mymodule1.ex" with "defmodule Thumbnailer do" in it IIRC
[14:01:33] <Nicd> Guest45: you probably want something like `@primary_key {:uuid, :binary_id, autogenerate: true}` in your schema
[14:03:41] <Guest45> Nicd: that worked, thanks!
[14:04:05] <Nicd> relevant reading: https://hexdocs.pm/ecto/Ecto.Schema.html#module-schema-attributes (and the next section in the same doc)
[14:04:15] <serafeim> yes i know that the filemae does not matter i just wanted to make sure that i won't have problems for having a filename starting with a capital letter :)
[14:06:03] <Guest45> Nicd: thanks, didn't know about these, it seems using :uuid instead of :id creates quite a few problems
[14:12:44] <Guest45> Nicd: is there anything else i've missed? I'm still getting `** (KeyError) key :id not found in: %Photo{uuid: "aaa-bbb-ccc-ddd"}` when i try to create a Photo changeset
[14:13:14] <Nicd> what does the code look like?
[14:15:28] <serafeim> ah i just implemented a genserver to have some global state and i must confess it was refreshing! i liked it very much!!! 
[14:15:43] <serafeim> of course i'm not sure how good would it be to store global state ... but since you've got htat hammer
[14:16:08] <Guest45> Nicd: hmm seems like the error comes from here -> https://github.com/elixir-waffle/waffle/blob/master/lib/waffle/storage/local.ex#L30
[14:16:15] <Nicd> sometimes you need global state, it all depends on the situation
[14:16:24] <Guest45> does waffle require an :id instead of a :uuid perhaps?
[14:17:01] <Nicd> I don't use waffle, I don't know. can't say anything without seeing your code and the full error
[14:22:18] <Guest45> Nicd: fair enough, well this is the error and the stacktrace -> https://dpaste.com/3SM7Q74V3
[14:22:41] <Guest45> i wasn't really sure why its pointing to line 21 tbh
[14:23:50] <Nicd> the error is from a function generated by `use Waffle.Ecto.Schema`
[14:26:06] <Guest45> oh ok
[14:26:52] <Nicd> at least I suspect so
[14:27:35] <Guest45> maybe it does in fact require an :id then
[14:30:39] *** Joins: Ilyu (~quassel@78.202.228.230)
[14:37:33] <Guest45> Nicd: ok i removed the :uuid field, added `add :id, :id, primary_key: true` and then added :uuid again all in a new migration, and now when i try to insert an Image, i get this error -> https://dpaste.com/E3PFJCVTW
[14:37:48] <Guest45> basicaly `null value in column "id" violates not-null constraint`
[14:37:58] <Nicd> did you change the schema?
[14:38:22] <Guest45> all i did was remove that @primary_key metacode
[14:39:14] <Nicd> 🤷
[14:40:36] <Guest45> this happens quite often when i go off the beaten path lol
[14:41:10] <Guest45> normally i  would just do a db reset, but i don't want to lose the data in my db
[14:41:38] <Nicd> I hope you're not developing on top of an important db
[14:41:50] <Nicd> could just do a backup and restore to that
[14:43:21] <Guest45> i wouldn't call it "important", it's mostly seed data but still took me a while to manually enter
[14:43:33] <Guest45> is it possible to just delete the entire table and migrations?
[14:44:17] <Guest45> there's not data in it, which makes things easier
[14:44:20] <Guest45> *no
[14:44:24] <Nicd> yes, then it will attempt to run all migrations next time
[14:46:44] <Guest45> Nicd: er so if i drop the table, and remove the related migration files from priv/repo/migrations, you're saying it will attempt to run all remaining migrations?
[14:47:59] <serafeim> the thing with the elixir and global state is that you're assured that no bad stuff will happen. i.e the access will by synchronized, items will be added to lists one by one etc. in other languages you'd either need to use funny sync things like mutexes or specific thread-safe structs like the ConcurrentHashMap in java
[14:48:24] <serafeim> i.e you can be more "relaxed" in using global state in elixir
[14:48:37] <serafeim> because you know it won't bite you in the future
[14:49:21] <Guest45> serafeim: wrt migrations?
[14:49:38] <Nicd> Guest45: ah I figured you meant the schema_migrations table. you may need to touch that also or it'll be out of sync with reality
[14:51:37] <serafeim> no this was a general comment :)
[14:51:51] <serafeim> the ecto does not do good migrations unfortunately
[14:52:01] <serafeim> i mean after you use django migrations you're spoiled and can't use anything else
[14:52:14] <Guest45> Nicd: ah ok it's that simple then? i.e. drop the table, delete the migration files and remove the associated rows in schema_migrations table?
[14:52:34] <Nicd> I don't know the contents of the schema_migrations table so I can't help you there
[14:52:59] <serafeim> but ok ecto's fine for simple small projects. but if you have large database table then it's worth it to convert your schema to django models so you'll be abel to use django-migrations
[14:53:08] <Guest45> Nicd: just has 2 columns, ["version", "inserted_at"]
[14:53:23] <Nicd> serafeim: lol
[14:53:30] <serafeim> Nicd: not lol. 
[14:53:38] <serafeim> Nicd: i've already done this to a project and was really happ
[14:53:43] <Guest45> serafeim: django does automate a lot that's true, but if you're stuck, it's really hard to unstick yourself
[14:53:58] <Nicd> I believe that serafeim, but I don't agree with the conclusion
[14:53:59] <serafeim> i.e share my models between django (to use migrations + django admin) and phoenix 
[14:55:01] <serafeim> well itt all depends on the way you develop
[14:55:16] <serafeim> but for me it fits very nice
[14:55:26] <serafeim> ymmv

[15:01:44] <Nicd> I don't know, you could try asking the waffle people
[15:01:49] <Guest45> the only way i now how to "solve" any non-standard ecto issue
[15:02:12] <Guest45> i think it is, but it's not too important anyway
[15:02:46] <Guest45> is file uploading a resource-intensive process by the way?
[15:03:22] <Guest45> (just images, and nothing > 1MB)
[15:06:05] <Nicd> not really
[15:06:28] <Nicd> bandwidth and file I/O will probably be the first bottlenecks
[15:06:52] <serafeim> yes elixir ain't like other languages (i.e php python ruby) that are worker-restricted
[15:07:02] <serafeim> it's more similar to java in this case
[15:07:20] <Guest45> nice
