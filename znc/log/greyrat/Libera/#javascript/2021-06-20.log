[01:48:06] <dustfinger> I am reading a PDF file out of a PostgreSQL bytea column. When the result is returned to the client side, it is a file object with type = Buffer and the data property appears to be a byte array. I would like to load this data into an <embed> HTML tag. When the page loads, I am calling loadBase64DataUrl (see https://termbin.com/c3po) to convert the data to base64 dataurl which I store in the state.src for rendering by the 
[01:48:06] <dustfinger> tag. Unfortunately, the embed tag is rendering a large number, rather than a human readable PDF. What am I doing wrong?
[01:50:11] <Slade> dustfinger, try iframe instead of embed
[01:50:17] <Maxdamantus> dustfinger: a large number like "400 Bad Request"?
[01:50:44] <Maxdamantus> Oh, nvm, it should be getting an actual data URL.
[01:51:28] <Maxdamantus> dustfinger: maybe try specifying the type in the `Blob` constructor. I'm guessing `file.type` won't be meaningful.
[01:53:46] <dustfinger> file.type equals Buffer

[01:59:51] <dustfinger> Okay, I tried calling the blog contstructor with a mime type as opposed to the type property from the file object. That definately helped. It now begins to render the content as a PDF, but the file still fails to render. The browser has a warning that says the PDF might not be displaying correctly and prompts me with an option to try opening the PDF in another program. When I try MuPDF, it I see the error "no objects foun

[02:03:12] <wroathe> dustfinger: Why not just have the backend generate a unique URL for the PDF, and feed that to the embed's src?
[02:03:15] <dustfinger> The problem might have something to do with the way postgresql stores bytea. This field stores data in "hex" format which means it encodes binary data as 2 hexadecimal digits per byte, most significant nibble first. When I am trying to create a Blob directly from hex format, I wonder if that is causing a memory alignment problem.
[02:03:21] <wroathe> dustfinger: Rather than dealing with a buffer on the client side?
[02:03:41] <dustfinger> wroathe: I might go that route. I thought that this would be faster for now.
[02:03:51] <entuland> dustfinger, are you able to extract that data from the server side somehow to verify the actual file is not corrupted or the alike?
[02:03:57] <wroathe> dustfinger: Faster?
[02:04:02] <wroathe> dustfinger: As in, faster to implement?

[02:36:24] <onosendi1> Logging like that, I get the error twice.
[02:37:49] <GreenJello> you probably at least want to log an Error instance, so you get a stack trace
[02:38:23] <GreenJello> but it's unclear from this example if you should throw
[02:38:49] <GreenJello> the component doesn't actually use the children prop, so it doesn't actually care if it follows any rules

[02:45:31] <GreenJello> validating children tends to be pretty arbitrary. Even if you need the DOM to be a button with a span inside, this would exclude a component child that renders a span

[08:31:28] <onosendi1> GreenJello: correct

[08:33:42] <GreenJello> it's fine, with the alternative being to turn this into a middleware
[08:34:28] <onosendi1> Ah, okay.
[08:34:47] <GreenJello> I'm not sure you want to handle all errors in any consistent way, though
[08:34:58] <GreenJello> it should probably at least be possible for the action to say "I got this"
[08:35:23] <onosendi1> GreenJello: I was planning to toast "Something went wrong" for 500's.
[08:37:23] <GreenJello> that might be universal enough to be fine
[08:38:03] <GreenJello> but you then need other code to ignore it so you don't display the same error twice
[08:38:59] <onosendi1> As in, if they keep clicking whatever to cause the error, they only get the one error?
[08:39:27] <GreenJello> no, like if you submit a form, and get an error back, the normal thing is to display the error in the form
[08:39:47] <GreenJello> so you would need everything to be on the same page about whether an error has been handled already or not

[08:41:33] <wroathe> I tried the hooks approach out and came up with this: https://github.com/JustinChristensen/react-sample-app/blob/master/src/components/EmployeeFields.jsx#L32-L53
[08:41:57] <wroathe> Basically mapStateToProps/mapDispatchToProps, but in hook form, and then composing together hooks that operate on props.

[08:54:41] <wroathe> GreenJello: Also, I was tinkering with an alternate API to the createSlice stuff I see Redux has now been recommending. Back when I used Redux I wasn't crazy about how createReducers made part of the state shape static, and coupled it to the structure of the reducers
[08:55:03] <wroathe> GreenJello: So this is what I came up with: https://github.com/JustinChristensen/react-sample-app/blob/master/src/reducers/employees.js#L3
[08:55:23] <wroathe> Err, ignore the line I selected. That was a mistake.
[08:56:22] <wroathe> Basically reducers explicitly handle a case, and they can be combined together with caseReducers to make a multi-case reducer. The final root reducer is essentially just a simple reducers[action.type](state, action.data);
[08:56:30] <wroathe> With immer wrapped around it
[08:56:39] <wroathe> https://github.com/JustinChristensen/react-sample-app/blob/master/src/utils/redux.js
[08:57:40] <wroathe> and usePropsOrState injects getState and dispatch from the Redux store into all event objects. so the event handlers and initialization routines are the only place where side effects occur, and they're easily testable
[08:58:49] *** Allypost_ is now known as Allypost
[09:00:17] <wroathe> Also, combineReducers has the unfortunate side effect that redux needs to try all of the reducers provided to it in sequence on every dispatch

[09:16:57] <wroathe> Also, another interesting thing generally is that on every store update react-redux has to loop through ALL of the places where useSelector is used and perform an equality check on the new return value and the previous return value to determine if it should trigger a re-render. So every "reactive" part of the UI needs to be completely re-evaluated on every state update
[09:17:54] <wroathe> Which isn't the end of the world, but it's something to think about. I think setting that up to log performance statistics about just how many comparisons were done and how long they took after every dispatch could fairly simply be done
[09:18:08] <wroathe> So the developer can keep an eye on the running time cost of updates
[09:20:29] <wroathe> Also, another takeaway is that immer is fucking rad

[17:49:46] *** Joins: Trieste_ (T@user/pilgrim)
[17:49:47] <entuland> there are animations and transitions even in pure CSS depending on the end goal

[17:50:28] <OhTheCode> its more than 10 things moving and timing in css animation/transition is hard even with scss formulas so I need a library
[17:51:03] <entuland> oh definitely better to use JS then, or a library, can't elaborate on how much bloated the libraries around are though

[17:51:45] <OhTheCode> 16kb for one and 11kb i saw another one , i want lightweight but one i'm gonna use again
[17:52:06] <entuland> I would probably give it a go with vanilla JS if the animations aren't too complex (say, just moving stuff around along different paths or scaling / rotating them)

[17:54:28] <OhTheCode> entuland: I've tried to do it before with just vanilla javascript, it can get complicated with 20 different animations. I don't know if this one would need requestAnimationFrame, i guess so
[17:55:22] <entuland> yes, that could be complex as a whole
[17:56:03] *** Trieste_ is now known as Trieste
[17:56:30] <theskillwithin> well I hope you get a lightbulb moment and realize what u should do
[17:57:13] <entuland> there are some animations that can be baked into SVG to an extent, and you could probably do them in, say, Inkscape
[17:57:46] <entuland> but if you want full control and you need to do complex stuff, it's probably better to just use a JS library and code in the sync of the various bits and pieces
[17:59:40] <OhTheCode> entuland: ok thanks, u might be right ,its not that hard but timing is tricky, do i use requestanimationFrame and have a cycle number to know which frame it's up to? i have about 4 frames and animations within each frame

[18:00:18] <entuland> what you need to do as actual nitty gritty details depend on the animations you need and what library you use
[18:00:30] <entuland> it's hard to say without knowing the exact requirements about the end result
[18:01:44] <OhTheCode> i know, but i think i've gotten a better idea now, i'll work it out, i'll try vanilla js first thanks for the link and the ideas
[18:01:54] <entuland> yw, gl!
[18:03:04] <OhTheCode> but continuous animation in javascript, would i use requestAnimationFrame ?
[18:03:34] <OhTheCode> i wonder if requestanimationFrame would be slightly demanding on the gpu
[18:03:39] <entuland> depends on how the animation is implemented, it could be as simple as adding a class and removing it when enough time has passed

[18:24:00] *** Joins: Allypost (~Allypost@user/allypost)
[18:26:10] <OhTheCode> mateeee, thanks. I just think with 20 or 40 svg items to animate, css animation ie adding a class isn't the best way to do it. I might be wrong, and i've noticed SVG has some things in attribute not in css properties which makes svg harder to animate eg <line x y> x and y are attributes so it's a big disadvantage over css in that way. Fill is an attribute and also can be used in style="fill:#ffffff" but x, y, transform etc are
[18:26:10] <OhTheCode> attributes so it makes it harder to work with svg to do css animation
[18:26:12] <theskillwithin> is that the site they gave biden instead of the nuclear football?
[18:27:45] <entuland> OhTheCode I'm not up to date with the recent changes but some of the things that used to be inaccessible via CSS are now available, such as the height and width properties, IIRC - some other stuff, yes, you may need to alter via JS
[18:29:19] <entuland> the MDN docs should help getting up to speed with the most recent changes
[18:30:21] <OhTheCode> u see what i mean though, svg transform, x, y, are attributes, so not something that can be changed by classList.toggle(), so that's a disadvantage i've found with svg. css variables can be used on css properties but not on attributes, css varaibles can make things so easy but that option is out for some svg elements
[18:31:41] <entuland> indeed
[18:31:59] <entuland> that's were you have to decide whether you want to roll your own or you want to use a library
[18:32:38] <entuland> the compromise is between investing time in studying the library or investing time in studying specific techniques via vanilla JS
[18:33:04] <OhTheCode> yep. I'm gonna take it on with vanilla javascript. Earlier people were talking about bootstrap. I try not to use libraries unless i need it. Too much bloating and slower page load and bad for SEO and bad for google
[18:33:10] <entuland> s/were/where
[18:33:18] <OhTheCode> yeah u are so right
[18:33:24] <entuland> you definitely don't need bootstrap
[18:33:36] <OhTheCode> no no, i mean about libraries in general
[18:33:37] <entuland> but you may take advantage of some specific JS animation libraries
[18:33:54] <entuland> oh okay
[18:34:04] <theskillwithin> wowa, i was saying i don't use bootcrap.  but that doesn't mean i don't use react
[18:34:23] <entuland> recrapt :P
[18:34:36] <theskillwithin> 🖕
[18:34:37] <OhTheCode> react is awesome
[18:34:41] <entuland> eheheh
[18:34:48] <OhTheCode> there is a tradeoff
[18:35:16] <OhTheCode> making it easier for developers is something good but at a cost, and its that judgement we must make
[18:35:34] <entuland> I don't care if people uses library X or Y if that's what gets the thing done in the time they need it and it doesn't become a problem for the end user (or for the developer)
[18:36:19] <OhTheCode> yeah, we have jobs to do and we need to make money and libraries make that easier, react can make soemthing that takes 10 hours, take 1 hour
[18:38:24] <OhTheCode> but bootstrap slows down the page load, when u want to rank on the first page on google, that can be a problem with bloated things, not always though. Using jquery for just 1 little feature is such a waste but that's what some of these wordpress web houses do. Like building cheap houses that look good on the outside but after some time u realize they aren't build greatly

[19:02:20] *** Joins: gggp (~textual@60.10.194.47)
[19:02:35] <entuland> laying out forms or other arrangements of contents used to be a pain in the past but nowadays it's relatively straightforward (knowing the newer CSS features)
[19:03:24] <entuland> and it may definitely be faster from scratch just adding what it needs on top of the default styling than having to "bend" any framework to your will
[19:05:18] <OhTheCode> with vb, you choose a field , drag it to where you want it, link it to the backend and link the field on the form to the database table and field and that's it, thats so quick but javascript, html and css is much much slower to do that. But its much much more flexible. But i think React might make it faster, I haven't used React yet though
[19:08:46] <entuland> indeed - it's the price to pay for such a flexibility / decoupling - there may not be any database at all on the server side processing a form and your form on the client side may be rendered in an arbitrary viewport size and aspect ratio - all of this adds complexity
[19:14:50] <entuland> there are also middle grounds where you can take advantage of form editors combined with the CSS flexibility (such as QT widgets)
[19:15:22] <entuland> there are also such JS based layout builders for web pages

[19:18:38] <entuland> beware of what builder you pick, if you pick an existing ones - as a silly example, there are some badly screwed approaches such as some wordpress plugins that on the surface look tempting for their ease of use, but they may store such layouts with their own format that may become a serious problem if such a plugin / builder breaks / stops being supported and whatnot

[20:41:08] <Selicre> so if you have a 120Hz display it becomes unplayable
[20:41:11] <OhTheCode> i heard requestAnimationFrame operates at 60 fps and if it can't do that, it drops to 30 fps, so either 60 fps or 30 fps, your browers may be reporting 25 fps but its requestanimationframes 30fps
[20:41:26] <Selicre> no, I said 25mspf, which is uhh.. 40fps I think
[20:41:33] <ljharb> OhTheCode: it offers no FPS guarantees at all
[20:41:39] <Selicre> exactly
[20:41:53] <ljharb> the whole point is that the browser gets to run it whenever it won’t slow down other things, and only when needed
[20:41:53] <Selicre> so the approach I took is to wait if it triggers too early
[20:42:09] <ljharb> so it’s perfect for unnecessary animations, and anything whose state is entirely time-based
[20:42:29] <Selicre> however, ever since the timing attack shit struck, it seems like the timer precision has been reduced significantly
[20:42:36] <Selicre> which affects the speed at which the game is running
[20:42:38] <ljharb> yep
[20:43:31] <Selicre> https://i.selic.re/elastic/ < game in question
[20:43:43] <Selicre> works perfectly in ff, but chrome seems to suffer in various ways

[20:55:35] <entuland> that game is brutal ahahaha
[21:05:19] <MJCD> Selicre: seems to work fine here on chrome
[21:05:23] <MJCD> played a few lvls
[21:05:59] <Selicre> entuland: can't really do much in 4 kilobytes, the difficulty curve ended up being quite steep lmao
[21:06:12] <Selicre> yeah, idk. It seems to work well for some people but not for others
[21:06:20] <MJCD> it maybe feels a bit fast
[21:06:26] <MJCD> but that's by design i'd imagine
[21:06:41] <entuland> I meant brutal as gameplay, not the looks of it or anything else
[21:06:59] <entuland> what's with the 4KB limitation?
[21:07:02] <Selicre> maybe, I kinda just put a bunch of random physics constants and went with it
[21:07:08] <entuland> brutal as tough / difficult
[21:07:08] <Selicre> entuland: I just wanted to make something in 4kB
[21:07:14] <Selicre> and see how far I can push it
[21:07:27] <Selicre> taught me a bunch of cool optimization tricks
[21:07:34] <entuland> okay, so it's not some kind of limitation of the technology, it's an arbitrary limit you set for yourself
[21:07:41] <Selicre> mhm
[21:07:44] <Selicre> My other game is 40kB
[21:07:44] <entuland> ok

[21:19:03] <Rockwood> o/
[21:19:25] <wroathe> You can limit the framerate yourself by only redrawing every other requestAnimationFrame (if 120 hz is too much, for example)
[21:21:19] <Selicre> wroathe: yes but how do I figure it out if the timer is scuffed
[21:21:35] <wroathe> Selicre: "scuffed"?
[21:22:06] <silly> there's a term in rugby like that
[21:22:16] <Selicre> basically just reporting wrong values
[21:22:42] <Selicre> e.g. advanced tracking protection in firefox makes it coarse to 100ms
[21:23:06] <Rockwood> lol
[21:23:13] <silly> requestanimationframe is hopefully unaffected
[21:23:15] <Rockwood> theskillwithin, still there bro
[21:23:16] <Rockwood> ?
[21:23:17] <Selicre> silly: ha
[21:23:26] <Selicre> it is in fact affected
[21:23:34] <Selicre> which is why that option is hopelessly useless
[21:23:45] <Selicre> the best way to avoid tracking is to be chrome 84 on windows 10
[21:23:46] <wroathe> I'm not following. As soon as you've determined that RAF operates at 120 fps, you just increment a counter and only re-render if it's % 2?
[21:23:58] <Selicre> wroathe: how do I determine that
[21:24:05] <Selicre> also framerates can change at any time
[21:24:16] <Selicre> I can drag the window to the 60Hz monitor and it'll run at 60fps
[21:24:17] <Rockwood> who is the owner of state concept?
[21:24:30] <Rockwood> JS or any other?
[21:24:40] <wroathe> Selicre: I'm not sure right off hand. I'm guessing there's a DOM API for reporting what the frequency of RAF is
[21:24:47] <wroathe> Selicre: But I"m eating breakfast right now and don't want to look it up
[21:24:48] <Selicre> there is, and it's scuffed
[21:25:08] <Selicre> you get a timer value that should be accurate down to a millisecond or so
[21:25:19] <silly> some mediaquery?
[21:25:31] <Selicre> silly: these things can change at runtime
[21:25:36] <Selicre> it's not just a static value
[21:25:38] <wroathe> I mean, if your timers are scuffed all bets are off anyway
[21:25:40] <Rockwood> lol
[21:25:43] <Selicre> honestly yeah
[21:25:47] <wroathe> I'm still not sure how or why it would be scuffed
[21:25:50] <Rockwood> no answers :D
[21:26:02] <Selicre> I should probably just stop fighting against this and just make a desktop app if your browser is doing weird shit
[21:26:05] <Rockwood> gn
[21:26:57] <wroathe> Pancakes are yummy
[21:27:02] <Selicre> or just have a big "this website works best in firefox" banner
[21:28:03] <wroathe> Selicre: Can you further define scuffed? I still don't get it?
[21:28:19] <Selicre> wroathe: generic word for "doesn't work as expected"
[21:28:25] <wroathe> Selicre: Like, does that mean that "They've said that this API does this, but I don't trust it."
[21:28:41] <wroathe> Or "I've seen this thing screw up my games, and here's the numbers"
[21:28:48] <Selicre> the latter, yes
[21:29:05] <Selicre> it _technically_ works properly but it's too coarse and ends up giving me issues
[21:29:24] <Selicre> and I think something as simple as a 60fps lock should be an easy thing
[21:32:14] <foureyes> do people routinely put complex objects in react component state, unlike redux, or should you keep it basic in all state?
[21:32:58] <foureyes> not sure why I'd want to keep some component state serialisable
[21:33:09] <wroathe> foureyes: You can, but you'll need to be mindful of the equality check you use to determine if it should be updated or not
[21:33:14] <wroathe> err, rendered or not, I mean
[21:33:50] <foureyes> ok, yeah all my useEffect hooks have explicit properties to watch

[22:45:59] <jamea> hi all,  https://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/ep7nxkvt/5/  how to validate data entry when user click on "Editar" green button, before confirm the changes?
[22:48:04] *** Joins: eck0 (~Android@mobile-166-173-62-252.mycingular.net)
[22:48:17] <entuland> what kind of validation do you need to perform? some checks can be "hardcoded" into the elements, such as the min/max values of a number field
[22:48:48] <entuland> and you'll need to do proper validation server side anyways
[22:50:10] <jamea> in this case: Price, range: 0,20 and no letters.... or other symbols
[22:51:29] <entuland> there are various approaches at that simple check, one is just using an number field instead of a text one, setting the limits there
[22:51:46] <entuland> no need to do any validation for other characters that wouldn't be allowed there anyways in a number field
[22:52:40] <wroathe> jamea: You can let the browser do that for you by using a "number" type input
[22:52:45] <jamea> note: i use a thid party plugin, see? table-edit
[22:52:48] <entuland> for more complex validation you can use something like this, since you're using jQuery: https://jqueryvalidation.org/validate/ or other facilities, I'm not really a jquery user
[22:52:50] <wroathe> jamea: <input type="number" ...
[22:53:15] <entuland> check the documentation of that library to see if you have control over what controls get added there
[22:53:38] <jamea> entuland, wroathe, this a plugin not mine the code... if possible i dont touche the original code... because the plugin is updated ... underastand,,,
[22:53:59] <entuland> yes, I understand
[22:54:24] <entuland> first check the documentation of table-edit to see if you can annotate your table or set the plugin properly so that you get a number field instead of a text field
[22:54:31] <entuland> don't fight against the libraries
[22:54:47] <wroathe> Idk, I've sworn off reading jQuery documentation long ago
[22:54:54] <wroathe> It's bad for my health. Good luck :P
