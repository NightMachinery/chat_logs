[02:33:27] <llua> 16 is the default number of events shown when you don't specify a starting point
[02:33:40] <llua> history 1 will show all of them
[02:35:51] <hajonnes> so does that mean that history from entry 1 gives the whole history?

[02:47:08] <hajonnes> I found the answer myself. 
[02:49:44] <mehwork> why does 'rm -rf node_modules' take 3 minutes sometimes?
[02:50:13] <llua> aliens
[02:53:15] <hajonnes> llua. 'history info 100' returns 'fc: event not found: info', according to the man page it should be the same as history 100. what do I missunderstand?

[03:03:26] <llua> a lot
[03:03:53] <phy1729> builtins, alias, functions are specific to a shell. External commands are still external. (Though note things like quoting are handled by the shell)
[03:06:44] <hajonnes> llua, phy1729, so using manjaor/arch wiki will give me problems if I do not stick to zsh or are the syntax overlapping?
[03:07:28] <llua> there is overlap, but they are different shells for a reason
[03:07:56] <llua> they behave differently, i imagine the arch docs are written with bash in mind
[03:11:54] <hajonnes> llua, so zsh it is not the default for arch? what do you like with zsh vs bash? 
[03:12:14] <hajonnes> I just installed manjaro and got zsh.

[03:13:13] <llua> i don't use bash often enough to know
[03:14:25] <llua> but bash is the default shell of arch. manjaro being something different i don't know about that
[03:14:44] <hajonnes> llua, ok. well thanks for the help, and I must say, comming form bash zsh was a pleasent surprice. but... I'm not used to it. I like the autocompletion.
[03:16:43] <hajonnes> and the look. but I do not know if it is just a setting...
[03:21:51] <hajonnes> llua, why did I get the manpage about commands that does not work when using 'man history' how can I see that I should use 'man zshbuiltins' instead?
[03:22:33] <phy1729> # type history
[03:22:38] <phy1729> > type history
[03:22:42] <machabot> phy1729: history is a shell builtin
[03:22:43] <phy1729> % type history
[03:22:58] <llua> some other software provided the man page, usually when you want to learn about builtin commands for shells, you read the man page for that shell
[03:22:59] <phy1729> so foo is a shell builtin means look it up in the shell docs
[03:24:17] <hajonnes> phy1729, llua, ok. how do I know what man-page is for the built in commands?
[03:24:45] <phy1729> it's man zshbuiltins
[03:24:57] <llua> since you are about to switch to bash tho, it would be in man bash
[03:25:01] <hajonnes> yes, but how do I see that?
[03:25:19] <hajonnes> llua, I'm not sure I will...
[03:25:33] <llua> its something that you know
[03:25:47] <hajonnes> ok. yes. hehe...
[03:25:47] <llua> we knew zsh's builtin commands are in zshbuiltins

[17:55:44] <Mikachu> there are people who would prefer to forbid filenames with spaces than to make their shell work in a reasonable way
[17:55:52] <saltrocklamp[m]> heh

[17:55:56] <saltrocklamp[m]> that and the huge amount of parameter expansion options!

[17:56:50] <saltrocklamp[m]> i think i asked this a long time ago, but it'd probably be a huge PITA to extract the various parameter expansion options to a standalone library of C functions right? some of them are really useful and surprisingly not necessarily trivial to implement in other languages

[17:58:25] <saltrocklamp[m]> ty this is a great article
[17:58:42] <Mikachu> (i obviously don't agree with parts of it) :)
[17:59:34] <saltrocklamp[m]> same. i would be in favor of banning ASCII control characters for sure though, including `\n`
[18:02:32] <llua> Add a “simplified quoting” mode to Bourne shells. <- that is far to low on the page
[18:03:37] <saltrocklamp[m]> "Spaces in filenames are less bad if other problems fixed"
[18:03:42] <saltrocklamp[m]> that should be section 1!
[18:04:35] <saltrocklamp[m]> you know what'd be great? elastic tabstops
[18:04:52] <saltrocklamp[m]> fixed size tabstops basically don't work
[18:05:34] <saltrocklamp[m]> if you had wide access to elastic tabstops in text editors and terminal emulators, people would probably be happier to use tabs instead of spaces for various things like separating fields in a delimited-column file
[18:06:10] <phy1729> I'd prefer storing the AST not a particular representation of it.
[18:06:19] <saltrocklamp[m]> indeed
[18:06:26] <Mikachu> there are too many ways to fix problems so we just keep the problems instead
[18:06:30] <saltrocklamp[m]> zsh shell syntax is pretty close to an AST
[18:06:40] <saltrocklamp[m]> probably half of this article is solved by not word splitting the results of parameter expansions and filename generation/expansions
[18:06:45] <phy1729> I assure you it is not
[18:07:04] <saltrocklamp[m]> well it's not an AST but it's closer to a stream of tokens than in other sh-derived shells
[18:07:28] <phy1729> $((   is unparsable until you see the closing ) or ))
[18:08:23] <saltrocklamp[m]> fair. i guess my point is that in a sensible shell like zsh, you don't have to worry about re-lexing expansions unless the user specifically requests it

[21:50:52] <FH_thecat> OK, but what should I see ?
[21:50:55] <FH_thecat> I see nothing
[21:51:23] <Mikachu> run-help is a builtin widget so if it somehow doesn't work, it's broken before the function gets invoked (probably)
[21:51:34] <Mikachu> or you overrode it with some other widget that doesn't work

[21:58:27] <FH_thecat> https://paste.ofcode.org/URAGPL3CZiU7eyWGi8sFVz
[21:59:04] <Mikachu> maybe we should go back to "it does not work"
[21:59:13] <Mikachu> what exactly happens when you press the keybind with the space there?
[21:59:19] <Mikachu> nothing? it runs run-help with the wrong arguments?
[21:59:25] <FH_thecat> Mikachu: nothing 
[21:59:38] <Mikachu> what does echo $_widgets[run-help] say
[21:59:52] <Mikachu> oops that's no the right command
[22:00:04] <Mikachu> just $widgets[run-help]
[22:00:09] <Mikachu> confused it with $_comps :)
[22:00:27] <FH_thecat> nothing.
[22:00:31] <FH_thecat> no output
[22:00:36] <Mikachu> that's impossible
[22:01:13] <Mikachu> well, it's not, but you presumably didn't run zle -D run-help
[22:01:55] <yaymukund> Is there a reason to prefer `echo` versus `eval` (or vice versa) for 'returning' values from a function?
[22:02:05] <Mikachu> that question makes no sense
[22:02:19] <yaymukund> damn
[22:02:25] <FH_thecat> even when i run "zle -D run-help", then $widgets[run-help] still does nothing
[22:02:44] <yaymukund> Mikachu: referring to this: https://www.linuxjournal.com/content/return-values-bash-functions
[22:02:56] <Mikachu> oh maybe there was some confusion, i wanted 'echo $widgets[run-help]', my "just" referred to the underscore
[22:03:11] <Mikachu>  but presumably the value is "builtin" then since you got no output
[22:03:19] <FH_thecat> builtin
[22:03:31] <Mikachu> it's hard to imagine it wouldn't work then
[22:03:39] <Mikachu> what about bindkey '^[h'
[22:03:53] <yaymukund> (That article is 10 years old, so I guess I'm just wondering if anything has changed)
[22:04:01] <FH_thecat> "^[h" run-help
[22:04:45] <Mikachu> yaymukund: ah, there's no reason to use eval to set the return vaule to a specific parameter, but the idiom is to just use REPLY for scalars or reply for arrays
