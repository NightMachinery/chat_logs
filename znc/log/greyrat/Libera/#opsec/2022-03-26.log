[01:36:44] <Joanna> Doesn’t matter if there is a democracy so long as people have the illusion of participating and can blame eachother for electing the wrong people. people refused to vote for Ralph Nader for decades because they thought he had no chance of winning. Even though he was on the ballot. People insisted upon voting for the lesser evil of the two candidates which they knew was bad. Ralph Nader was probably controlled opposition to give 
[01:36:44] <Joanna> illusion of choice whilst the news media made sure he wasn’t taken too seriously.

[18:34:12] <Joanna> Interesting weapons https://www.rt.com/russia/552743-kalibr-cruise-missile-ukraine/
[18:45:12] <jessicara> my thoughts are that this war is showing small cheap drones can be surprisingly more effective than many of us imagined
[18:45:51] <jessicara> millions worth of equipment baited to turn on radar then hit by loiter radiation-seeking suicide drones
[18:46:54] <jessicara> seems like a lot of people are too scared to think of what this means for future terrorism
[18:50:59] <Joanna> It’s hard to say what is happening. According to Scott Ritter russia is winning. He also mentioned that the us has discarded nice
[18:52:03] <Joanna> Nuclear weapons treaties and Is bringing back the threat of nuclear war
[18:52:54] <jessicara> only one threatening nukes is putin it seems
[18:53:20] <jessicara> makes sense though, has been a part of planning the idea of nuking poland in particular
[18:53:32] <jessicara> more the effect it would have on an unprepared nato

[18:55:11] <Joanna> For people who can understand spoken English...
[18:55:47] <jessicara> i guess i didn't think ukraine would win, but this is far more a fight being put up than expected
[18:55:55] <jessicara> lots to learn from it
[18:56:21] <Joanna> jessicara: I think there are ways of having weapons set up that are more dangerous than others.
[18:58:19] <Joanna> According to above video it is slow because Russians are trying to avoid killing civilians. If they wanted to they could just kill indiscriminately and finish sooner.
[18:59:56] <Joanna> The video is pretty good it had the technical names of the weapons systems etc.
[19:01:25] <jessicara> i don't buy the denazification narrative
[19:02:13] <Joanna> Russians don’t like nazis many were killed by Nazis in ww2
[19:02:13] <jessicara> ukraine has less nazis than poland, uk, russia...
[19:02:21] <jessicara> indeed
[19:02:31] <jessicara> so russia should denazify britain
[19:02:36] <jessicara> and america
[19:02:40] <jessicara> itself too
[19:03:22] <jessicara> i'd think it has more to do with keeping nato at a distance than this excuse
[19:03:49] <Joanna> The Nazis are I small minority but are good at scaring the government into doing what they want by threatening violence.
[19:04:59] <Joanna> The Nazis are a tool of nato.
[19:05:17] <jessicara> i do think russia will win eventually though
[19:05:25] <jessicara> but i think opening so old style with tanks... no
[19:05:26] <Joanna> They were funded and trained with us tax dollars.
[19:05:28] <jessicara> that cost so much
[19:06:34] <Joanna> They used modern weapons to destroy the military infrastructure though
[19:06:54] <jessicara> actually, it was banned to send arms and such to azov
[19:07:14] <Joanna> Banned by whom?
[19:07:16] <jessicara> i guess that didn't stop sweden though
[19:07:17] <jessicara> america
[19:07:40] <jessicara> i don't buy the not targetting civilians either
[19:08:08] <jessicara> it is standard no matter what side are on to demoralize, cluster bomb residential areas and get people in a panic
[19:08:43] <Joanna> They have been sending weapons and training them to NATO standards for years . The azov is part of the Ukrainian military.
[19:09:12] <jessicara> yeah, and helping azov specifically was banned
[19:09:19] <Joanna> In not in Ukraine
[19:09:22] <jessicara> to be fair they don't need help
[19:10:23] <Joanna> Well supposedly it’s illegal to import cocaine into a country too yet it happened using military planes...
[19:10:25] <jessicara> this sounds like some serious nonsense, suckering the russians in, letting them invade? what?
[19:10:46] <jessicara> you can't stop russia invading lol
[19:10:54] <jessicara> russia will do what russia will do
[19:11:22] <jessicara> also, what do you think about kidnapping mayors and replacing them?
[19:11:56] <Joanna> Russians set up elaborate trap it seems. They could have attacked much earlier but they waited until the conditions were right.
[19:12:43] <Joanna> I haven’t heard about kidnapping mayors
[19:15:02] <Joanna> I’ve heard Russians leave city governments in place
[19:17:54] <Joanna> The worst part of this is all the famines that will probably happen from a combination of sanctions and a highly complex food system
[19:20:07] <jessicara> yeah this isn't going to be good
[19:33:55] <Joanna> Governments should be doing everything in their power to make sure that there is food as Castro did in Cuba when Cuba lost their modern farming after ussr collapsed.
[19:35:03] <jessicara> sort of wonder if china might be the only one to do this
[19:35:57] <Joanna> Realistically though they will probably let a lot of people starve to death and then act all confused and try to shift the blame elsewhere.
[19:37:34] <Joanna> I’m really amazed about the lack of fertilizer problem which could easily be solved by sending the sewage to the farmland like they did in the 1800s
[19:38:13] <Joanna> Or using animal waste..
[19:43:08] <Rathskalon> true, far too much reliance on industrial agriculture.
[19:43:14] <Rathskalon> I found a cynical, satirical glimmer of hope from this Corbett article - https://corbettreport.substack.com/p/how-to-survive-regime-change
[19:43:32] <jessicara> reason usually don't use sewage directly is tend to end up with a lot of human parasites
[19:46:32] <Joanna> You have to be careful and not step into it with bare feet
[19:47:19] <Joanna> I’ve heard of hookworm
[19:47:59] <Joanna> In any case the risk of disease is better than starving to death..
[19:49:25] <Rathskalon> yeh, do safe farming :) - https://www.apsed.in/post/sewage-farming
[19:50:53] <Joanna> You would probably want to use sewage a long time before you want to harvest . There are also ways to process night soil without the water
