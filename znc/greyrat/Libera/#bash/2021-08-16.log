[00:39:22] <greycat> Anyway, this site is not teaching you rigorous coding.  It's testing your knowledge of basic common tricks.
[00:39:56] <greycat> I went through it from the beginning for a few minutes, and one of the questions was to list all the files in the current directory, one per line.  It accepted "ls -1" as the answer, which we all know is not bullet-proof.
[00:40:09] <greycat> So it's obvious that they wanted to hear the common, but flawed, answer.
[00:40:15] <pj> if that, the use of the term "all files" there implies that you probably should also set dotglob, but I'd be willing to bet they aren't looking for that in the answer.

[02:54:24] <nova> I want to have this as a quick one-liner. Given a list of directories, how can I cycle through them given that one of them is there (default to a default if non exist).

[02:55:45] <nova> so tl;dr  [ -f /tmp/.bg_cur ] || echo dark > /tmp/.bg_cur && {{{no idea what to do here}}}   .. also note that ~/.backgrounds has 3 folders in it: dark light nature. And note that these could be arbitrary names
[02:55:51] <alzgh> if parameter is an array subscripted by * or @, the result of ${#parameter[@]} and ${#parameter[*]} does not differ. That's what I understand from the man pages. superboot

[03:16:43] <greycat> nova: Are you trying to say that you have a *file*, and inside this file is the name of a directory, and each time your script is invoked, you would like to read the name from the file, and change it to the "next in line", and write it back to the file?
[03:17:30] <greycat> Suffice to say, this is not a one-line job.
[03:19:32] <greycat> One approach would be to set up an associative array that maps each possible name to the next in line.  Then read the name, look up the "next" in the array, and write that out.
[03:20:24] <nova> greycat, I am just going to rewrite my background changing utility. I made a bg changer, and I will just make it better. for example  bg_switch next dark changes to ~/.backgrounds/dark/* (and it caches the current one in $XDG_DATA_HOME (~/.local/share/ by default)). So, I just need to rewrite it so it can also cycle through different types of backgrounds (dark, light, nature, etc) based on what is
[03:20:27] <nova> inside the background dir (~/.backgrounds by default). I was trying to do a quick dirty bash hack in a keybinding for my window manager, but I gave up. thanks for the help anyway
[03:21:57] <nova> I og write bg_switch in bash, but then rewrote in python for better option handling and because it's annoying to write stuff like this in bash.

[04:06:37] <greycat> printf '    <action>%s</action>\n' "${thing[i]}"
[04:06:50] <ormaaj> Why do you have litteral escape sequences stored in a variable?
[04:06:59] <r00t^> AntonioPt: it might behave in ways you did not expect if your string contains backslashes
[04:06:59] <emanuele6> greycat: thing could be an associative array
[04:07:36] <AntonioPt> i learn php and im doing in php logic :D and yes im using an array 
[04:07:55] <greycat> *what kind* of array
[04:08:01] <AntonioPt> and what i wanna do it works fine 
[04:08:29] <AntonioPt> my_list=( 1 2 3 )
[04:08:47] <greycat> so it's an indexed array, not an associative array.  then my answer stands.
[04:08:51] <emanuele6> then, you should use ${ACTION_LIST[i]} without the $
[04:09:02] <neshpion> nova: heh i have a pretty ugly wallpaper cycler/switcher myself, to select prev/next/random wallpaper or by filename, from among my ~13k wallpapers
[04:09:04] <ormaaj> array makes no difference. You almost always want to directly store the string, not the unexpanded version of it.
[04:09:37] <greycat> The reason the type of array was brought up was because it changes whether you want [i] or [$i]
[04:09:46] <AntonioPt> got it 
[04:09:58] <AntonioPt> yes yes you are right about the $
[04:10:02] <AntonioPt> thxx
[04:10:15] <AntonioPt> its my php logic lol
[04:10:21] <AntonioPt> thxx all

[05:44:18] <superboot> "always"... for most definitions, but you could always have history turned off.
[05:44:43] <sybariten> hmmm
[05:45:16] <sybariten> i mean, i see history, i can do my usual ctrl-r stuff....  but !1483 doesnt work, oddly enough. I must be missing something fundamental
[05:47:05] <sybariten> bash: !1483: command not found
[05:47:36] *** Quits: sinaowolabi (~SinaOwola@102.134.114.1) (Remote host closed the connection)
[05:47:37] <superboot> Try ctrl-alt-e when you have !1483 on your commandline. 
[05:47:44] <superboot> It should expand it on the line.
[05:48:05] <sybariten> is it like running !1483:p  ?
[05:48:32] <superboot> Oh! Did you check if your history that is loaded in to your environment goes back that far?
[05:48:42] <superboot> #history | tail
[05:48:53] <sybariten> hmmm
[05:49:38] <sybariten> i mean, sure, if i do history i see like 1490 commands or something. I think i changed variables to get longer history storage
[05:49:42] <superboot> make that head...
[05:50:02] <sybariten> ctrl alt e didnt do anything. Alt . works though 
[05:50:20] <sybariten> with head it shows from #1
[05:50:33] <superboot> And when you run "history" command you see the 1483 entry you are looking for?
[05:50:44] <superboot> Ah, ok. 
[05:50:53] <sybariten> Yep absolutely. I wonder if this is realted to me using a not-so-common terminal or something
[05:51:38] <superboot> Try echo $- and see if there is a capital H in the output.
[05:52:27] <sybariten> mhm mhm

[05:52:46] <superboot> Is that a yes?
[05:52:47] <sybariten> Whats this?   himBs
[05:53:26] <sybariten> No, smaller h
[05:53:29] <superboot> They map to the flags you can give to /bin/bash. so himBs is like: bash -h -i -m -B -s
[05:53:38] <sybariten> oh really
[05:53:49] <sybariten> btw i couldnt figure what teh english opposite of capital is
[05:54:06] <superboot> sybariten: That is the problem. -H is to enable "! syle hisotry substitution" as the manual says.
[05:54:15] <superboot> "lower case"
[05:54:38] <superboot> "lower-case" is USA, "under-case" is British English. I'm from USA
[05:54:46] <sybariten> yeah but there is already upper case as an opposite of _that_ ....   thought there would be somethig more elegant
[05:55:04] <superboot> sybariten: Yeah, me too.
[05:55:39] <superboot> So to fix your problem you can run /bin/bash -H which will give you a new session with history expansion on. I'm sure there is a shopt setting for it too. I'll look.
[05:56:23] <superboot> Ah! set -H
[05:56:31] <superboot> aka, run the command "set -H"
[05:56:42] <sybariten> yeah, i've never really though of there my options for bash are set...? This bash command is effectively started by tmux, i think...
[05:57:24] <superboot> It is supposed to be "on" by default, but you can add the "set -H" line to your $HOME/.bashrc file.
[05:57:35] <superboot> Are you on a mac?
[05:57:52] *** Joins: vlm (~vlm@user/vlm)
[05:58:31] <sybariten> oh no
[05:58:57] <superboot> "oh no" = you are not on a mac? or "I am, is that a problem?" kind of thing?
[05:59:04] <sybariten> It's hmmm  well i'm effectively at a linux server, but coming from Win SSH through chrome
[05:59:22] <sybariten> it was, "oh, no no. I'm not"   ;----)
[05:59:47] <sybariten> i'll try doing set -H manually
[06:00:27] <superboot> Haha, that really shouldn't matter. Once you have an actual session with bash, you are sending keystrokes. Although that is quite an unusual setup, so perhaps that is why -H is off.
[06:00:55] <superboot> I'm not well versed in the details of when sessions are "login" sessions vs interactive, etc. 
[06:00:58] <sybariten> now it works better! And H is in that echo $- thing. Thank you so much!
[06:01:16] <superboot> My pleasure.
[06:01:28] <sybariten> Interesting. Never really had this one. But i mean, i do ctrl-r _aaall the time_ , but i do !#  very seldom
[06:01:53] <superboot> sybariten: Same here. I've maybe done !# like 5 times... ever.

[06:03:14] <sybariten> hehe. This time it was for an rsync followed by a git add and some git statuses thrown in between. So a chain of three old commands
[06:03:17] <superboot> You mentioned you use alt-.  (alt-dot)   Try "echo me you" then "alt-1" then "alt-," (alt-comma). It is a way to grab arguments other than the last one (like alt-. does).
[06:04:12] <superboot> Also, ctrl-o  after you have ctrl-r (searched) for an old command. It executes the comand you have found and pulls the next one up from the history.
[06:04:30] <superboot> Both those tricks save tones of time, once you get used to it.

[06:08:03] <sybariten> I've never used alt-. before tonight (to analyze these ! related problems) , hehe. 
[06:08:28] <sybariten> What does ctrl-o do again?
[06:08:38] <superboot> One of the more common patterns I do is: mkdir /my/dir;  and then cd alt-.
[06:08:48] <sybariten> just passes on to the next commands after then one i found with ctrl-r ?
[06:09:01] <sybariten> oh, yeah thats handy!
[06:09:01] <superboot> Yes, you got it.
[06:10:04] <superboot> also, if you are on the latest command (the one most recently run) and hit ctrl-o, it will execute it and load it back in. So you can spam the screen with: echo I Am AWESOME!  ctrl-o ctrl-o... etc.

[06:12:56] <sybariten> actually, what does ctrl-o really do by strict definiton? I'm too tired to really understand it

[06:15:45] <superboot> Yes.

[06:18:58] <sybariten> uh, i'm completely confused now. 
[06:19:27] <sybariten> I do echo "alpha", return, then echo "bravo", return
[06:19:56] <superboot> Try these two commands: mkdir ./test   and then    cd ./test    Then use the up arrow to go up to mkdir ./test   and hit ctrl-o a bunch of times.
[06:20:11] <sybariten> then go back to alpha with cursor and do cttrl-o, over and over, and i get alhpa bravo alpha bravo alpha bravo etc ... Maybe this is expected but i'm just failing to see it now, haha
[06:20:13] <superboot> It will make a deep tree of ./test/test/test/test/test/test/test/....
[06:20:41] <superboot> It is appending to your history (making the list longer) on each command you execute. 
[06:21:11] <greycat> If you'd like to read what it does, it's in the man page, under operate-and-get-next (C-o)
[06:21:14] <sybariten> okay, oh, yeah. I was failing to see before that it was actually also polluting my history with it, hehe
[06:21:35] <sybariten> i thought it only executed it without adding it actually

[21:32:33] <jaggz> yes
[21:32:51] <emg> jaggz: bigger question: why do you want to source AND execute the same script? that right there is a bad idea and if you fixed that you wouldn't have this problem
[21:33:19] <jaggz> I have my foo-settings file (different types of those, to keep various settings including processing)

[23:39:08] <wwilliam> How do i find if a while loop is running?
[23:39:41] <greycat> put an echo or printf command inside it
[23:40:05] <wwilliam> Well the while loop is already running, I need to find it.
[23:40:33] <wwilliam> This is what is running while read -r x;do echo "$x";ls -l "$x"|tail -3;done < af1
[23:41:08] <greycat> so you did "ps -ef" or "ps auxw" and looked for the ls and head commands, right?
[23:41:38] <wwilliam> I did pgrep while
[23:42:00] <greycat> well that was daft.
[23:42:07] <greycat> while is not a *program*.  it's a shell keyword.

[23:42:59] <wwilliam> Sorry graycat checking ls and head commands
[23:43:57] <colo> `while` is not a process/program of its own, it's something that exists inside your running bash process/interpreter only. you cannot find it by looking at the system's process table.
[23:44:02] *** Joins: Gooberpatrol66 (~Gooberpat@user/gooberpatrol66)
