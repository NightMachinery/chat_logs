[00:00:09] <dpk> that came to Mac OS X from NeXTSTEP. the control key in old Mac OS was completely different and uniquely useless
[00:00:31] <dpk> depending what old language i've most recently been typing in, caps lock (to switch to Greek keyboard), l, caps lock (to switch back) will give me an λ. which isn't too bad
[00:01:10] <dpk> if i've been working on Sanskrit it'll give me ल instead though, which is not what i want when coding
[00:02:12] <mdhughes> L is probably an acceptable rename for most people, only old FORTRAN nerds are gonna use it as a variable.
[00:03:49] <Zipheir> dpk: Right.  I suspect it would be best to just write the SRFI with "lambda*" and see what comes out of the discussion (assuming there is one).
[00:05:13] <Zipheir> Interestingly, the paper has a bug: they use the syntax-rules pattern (a a* ... . rest) to try to match "polyvariadic" formals lists like (x y z . args).  This isn't a valid pattern, however.
[00:06:01] <Zipheir> And most syntax-rules implementations don't allow . to be a literal.  Hmm...
[00:07:33] <dpk> hmm, i think it's a valid pattern in R6RS
[00:07:38] * dpk checks
[00:08:16] <dpk> "A <pattern> is an identifier, constant, or one of the following. […] (<pattern> <pattern> ... . <pattern>)" — http://www.r6rs.org/final/html/r6rs-lib/r6rs-lib-Z-H-13.html
[00:08:46] <dpk> "More formally, an input form F matches a pattern P if and only if one of the following holds: […] P is of the form (P1 ... Pn . Px) and F is a list or improper list of n or more elements whose first n elements match P1 through Pn and whose nth cdr matches Px."
[00:10:24] <dpk> several complex syntax-rules macros i've written recently would be at least somewhat simpler if those patterns were allowed
[00:10:46] <Zipheir> IIUC that doesn't describe (<pattern> <pattern> ... <ellipsis> . <pattern>)
[00:10:57] <dpk> no wait
[00:11:01] <dpk> yeah, that's confusing
[00:11:06] <dpk> ... isn't ellipsis
[00:11:35] <dpk> however, (<pattern> ... <pattern> <ellipsis> <pattern> ... . <pattern>) does cover that use (since ... is zero or more)
[00:11:40] <Zipheir> That's what H & F seem to be using, and the various syntax-rules implementations aren't having it.
[00:11:46] <dpk> "P is of the form (P1 ... Pk Pe <ellipsis> Pm+1 ... Pn . Px), where <ellipsis> is the identifier ... and F is a list or improper list of n elements whose first k elements match P1 through Pk, whose next m−k elements each match Pe, whose next n−m elements match Pm+1 through Pn, and whose nth and final cdr matches Px."
[00:11:54] <dpk> that might only be valid in syntax-case
[00:12:09] <dpk> like identifier-only patterns are only valid in syntax-case for reasons i will never understand
[00:12:19] <Zipheir> Possibly.
[00:13:11] <Zipheir> A crummy work-around is using something other than ., e.g. (syntax-rules (·) ((_ (x y ... · rest) ...) ...)
[00:13:34] <dpk> you can gather the cdrs one expansion at a time
[00:13:47] <Zipheir> Then you have to write (lambda* (x y · rest) ...)  :p
[00:14:02] <Zipheir> Hmm, possibly.
[00:14:22] <Zipheir> I have to finish the paper, then figure out what's wrong with the final version, if anything.
[00:14:30] <dpk> that's what my opt-lambda implementation does (though also because it needs one unique identifier per optional argument, meaning one expansion per argument using the trick discovered by Clinger and/or Rees)
[00:15:23] <Zipheir> dpk: Interesting.  Is that in the SRFI 227 repo?
[00:15:35] <dpk> yes, but it's also here https://gitlab.com/dpk/presrfis/-/blob/master/srfi-89/lambda-optional.scm
[00:15:41] <dpk> uhh
[00:15:43] <dpk> or was there
[00:15:53] <dpk> (that's where my browser history told me it would be)
[00:16:04] <dpk> oh, here https://gitlab.com/dpk/presrfis/-/blob/master/keyword-arguments/lambda-optional.scm
[00:17:59] <Zipheir> dpk: Thanks, I'll try to comprehend it. :)
[00:20:34] <dpk> Chez accepts this macro:
[00:20:34] <dpk> (define-syntax parse-list
[00:20:34] <dpk>   (syntax-rules ()
[00:20:34] <dpk>     ((_ items ... . tail)
[00:20:34] <dpk>      '(items: (items ...) tail: tail))))
[00:21:00] <dpk> as does Chibi, actually
[00:23:28] <dpk> but Chicken doesn't like it, unsurprisingly
[00:24:08] <Zipheir> Yeah, that's my experience.
[00:24:26] <Zipheir> And it's not valid per R7.
[00:24:49] <dpk> well, maybe it'll be valid in R7 Large
[00:25:09] <dpk> (very probably, if the current results of the Yellow ballot are anything to go by)
[00:26:57] <Zipheir> Maybe it can be worked around in the H & F paper.  We'll see.
[00:27:07] <dpk> actually … R7 Large does also say that (⟨pattern⟩ ... ⟨pattern⟩ ⟨ellipsis⟩ ⟨pattern⟩ ... . ⟨pattern⟩) is a valid pattern, and gives the same rule as in R6!
[00:27:19] <dpk> so Chicken and any other implementation rejecting it is wrong
[00:27:32] <dpk> not the first bug in Chicken's syntax-rules i've found recently
[00:27:44] <mdhughes> CHICKEN is, as noted, R5+=2, not R7.
[00:28:03] <Zipheir> Oh, you're right.  I forgot that ... is zero or more, not one or more.
[00:28:06] <Zipheir> Derp.
[00:29:12] <Zipheir> mdhughes: Apposite observation.  That is not a valid pattern in R5RS syntax-rules.
[00:29:42] <dpk> yes, it is invalid in R5RS (just checked)
[00:33:19] <Zipheir> dpk: Thanks for your help.

[16:41:07] <amazigh> :D
[16:41:45] <amazigh> I made up the generator part, snowball is a programming language, in which the algorithm is described, given the generator and the description of the algorithm, one can generate a stemmer.
[16:42:38] <dpk> the Snowball compiler generates/can generate C, though, right?
[16:42:52] <dpk> so just use your favourite Scheme's FFI
[16:43:21] <amazigh> yes.
[16:43:50] <amazigh> indeed, it's prolly better to make a first version using FFI.
[16:44:19] <amazigh> indeed it is compiler
[16:50:55] <amazigh> I am playing around nanogenmo ie. I want to generate a 50k words novel (based on some other text); I trying to figure how to generate mezangelle programmatically
