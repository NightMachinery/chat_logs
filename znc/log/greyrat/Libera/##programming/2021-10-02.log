[00:20:42] <vdamewood> Anyway, Arabic doesn't have an actual word for 'of'. They just use a grammatical construct where two nouns together indicate 'possession'. Though classical Arabic does  include a genitive suffix -i.
[00:21:14] <Hash> During the movement to India around 800AD
[00:21:34] <Hash> They developed that in the form of ko/ka/ki/ke

[00:21:52] <Hash> it varies.
[00:21:55] <Hash> depending on context
[00:22:17] <Hash> Arabic doesn't have a t or a p sound.
[00:22:25] <Hash> i had an ARabic teacher in 3rd grade

[00:24:43] <vdamewood> Well, like I said 'soft' is meaningless.
[00:25:06] <vdamewood> In Russian a 'soft' letter is palatised. In Korean a 'soft' sound is lenis.

[06:17:43] <Hash> I'm not sure why I can't do this with English. I can do it in couple of other languages
[06:17:57] <flaknet99> yeah that does sound more efficient, at least  cmpared to english

[06:18:17] <Hash> But there are people who are adept at speed reading English
[06:18:31] <flaknet99> do they have rules for plurals or is the symbol changed in a significant way?
[06:18:39] <Hash> Or it could just be that because of the way that spy novel authors (both of them) phrased things, after a while you get used to it.

[11:20:44] <mrig> oh there is such a big difference between making modifications to code when you have a linter on, and when you do not.
[11:20:58] <Lyn> what's linter
[11:21:15] <mrig> Much nicer when it is not on, as the linter noise is quite distracting.
[11:21:53] <mrig> Lyn: a linter is a parser that reads your code and highlights anything that is matched in its rule set.
[11:22:07] <mrig> IDE's use them to show hints and the likes.
[11:22:30] <mrig> so when you start refactoring something they make the code light up like a christmas tree :)
[11:22:41] <Lyn> ohh
[11:22:46] <GeDaMo> A linter is the code version of Clippy :P
[11:22:48] <Lyn> can you automate the flashing lights too
[11:23:19] <mrig> I'd forgotten what it is like when you have it turned off, much easyer to think about what you are doing and not get driven by the computer mindlessly.
[11:23:20] <iridium__> i hate the wavy red underlines which IDE's keep using. that's why i don't use an IDE.
[11:23:26] <arahael> mrig: In haskell, we have a program called "ghcid", which, as you're making changes, it continiously rebuilds the project and spits out any error or warnings, whenever you save a change.  It's remarkably low-tech, yet remarkably effective.
[11:23:30] <iridium__> s/IDE's/IDEs/g
[11:24:35] <mrig> yes some of the command line tools with go are really nice, as they are there should you want to call them and work well, but not all the time unless you set the editor up to do that.
[11:24:36] <arahael> mrig: And the error messages are *very* helpful, including "Perhaps you should add 'frobbit' to the import list of 'Data.Frobbit'? or even suggesting a suitable function to use instead.
[11:24:49] <mrig> GeDaMo: lol :D

[11:26:36] <Lyn> I think clippy would suit macOS's theme
[11:27:21] <mrig> There is a switch over in thought though, from I am doing something to I am following orders from my computer.
[11:27:26] <mercenary> Has anybody done research into how much energy the IDE spends in generating wavy red lines versus a Mk.I programmer brain?
[11:27:51] <mrig> changes the way that you think about refactoring and how you remember what it is that you are doing.

[11:29:10] <Lyn> they should just be straight bold lines
[11:29:16] <mercenary> mrig: given enough dimensions to work in, certainly
[11:29:39] <mrig> mercenary: nice, perhaps we could use fortran for this?

[11:31:35] <flaknet99> nothing is worse than using laggy javascript for your million dollar spacecraft UI
[11:31:41] <mrig> I was thinking that with all that waviness, plugins could benefit from some precision engineering.
[11:31:45] <mercenary> iridium__: I have had to port a 300k lines fortran model, with common blocks hitting the 600-variable max limit, into something else. It can be bad
[11:32:41] <iridium__> mercenary: i've had similar problems with 80-column width restrictions, etc. i meant that it's not bad when you're writing it afresh.
[11:33:37] <mercenary> One can write decent programs in most languages. And one can also abuse most languages yes
[11:33:43] <iridium__> mercenary: not that i would do that.

[16:04:06] <Rounin> private methods can only be accessed by the object itself... So I guess in theory they could all be inlined

[16:09:01] <[itchyjunk]> A.T(B) { return A.field + B. field; } would be fine
[16:09:06] <Rounin> As long as private fields can be accessed from any object of the same class, and any code in the other class that's not static is in a method, then it follows that it has to work that way

[16:58:32] <pyzozord> so we had recently some discussions about software correctness and I mentioned that especially in healthcare I'd like that developers paid more attention to correctness. Ideally with formal proofs, but if not, at least with TDD.
[16:59:43] <pyzozord> I had an interview yesterday to a private healthcare service. An app for older people who need a caretaker at home and for those caretakers.
[16:59:46] <user51> what if your formal proof has a bug?

[17:01:49] <pyzozord> and it made me realize that I probably have too high expectations
[17:02:01] <[itchyjunk]> user51, in a type system, if you prove something, it is more likely that it is true than it is not.

[17:09:34] <[itchyjunk]> But deepmind is one example of who is in this game.
[17:10:02] <[itchyjunk]> Yes, but what subset of "health care" do you want to type check and for what?
[17:10:10] <pyzozord> my point was, I'd like the developers of such app to make damn sure that the app will send emergency signal when it notices something wrong
[17:10:13] <pyzozord> etc
[17:10:20] <[itchyjunk]> the social media aspect of it doesn't need to type check
[17:10:48] <pyzozord> i mean it's not social media, sorry. It's a communication platform between patients and health professionals
[17:11:24] <pyzozord> if I send a message to my doctor, I want to be sure he received it

[19:35:24] <node1> can we consider a time complexity of a loop  to be  `log n` when n is divided by any constant number  inside it.

[19:37:48] <node1> I'm just trying to find the cases where i could apply `log n ` inside a control structure of a program. And i found that it's applicable in the cases when a loop variable is divided with constant number over a sorted list or array.  
[19:38:40] <node1> For example `binary search` is the best example of `log n`

[19:39:57] *** Quits: saurabhs (~saurabhs@183.83.47.51) (Client Quit)
[19:40:08] <iridium__> node1: the point is how many times you perform some operation for a given input n, which is the number of elements in this case.
[19:40:55] <iridium__> node1: you see in binary search, you keep throwing away half the list. it's like you're dividing n by 2 at every step. that would soon reduce the array to the element you want to find.
[19:42:02] <iridium__> node1: if the array if 8 elements long, on average you'd do it 3 times. see that, by definition of `log`, you perform `log n` operations (3 = log 8).
[19:42:03] <node1> I see, but on some random post somebody claims that multiplication of loop variable is also being consider to be `log n` for time complexity.

[19:44:31] <node1> okay.
[19:44:33] <iridium__> node1: take a very small number and try to count the number of steps you'd have to go through.
[19:44:41] <iridium__> node1: then try to generalise.
[19:44:49] <node1> yes 
[19:44:58] <iridium__> node1: you do understand why binary search is O(log n), right?
[19:45:07] <node1> Yes.
[19:45:19] <InPhase> node1: The operative question is only to consider how the operation count scales with input size.
[19:45:37] <node1> ok.
[19:45:48] <iridium__> node1: while multiplying the iterator would have the same effect as the binary search, make yourself believe it by trying a real algorithm like that.

[19:47:08] <iridium__> node1: there's no formula of what the Big-O will be given some property of the algorithm. each case is different.
[19:47:30] <iridium__> node1: once you get the hang of it, you'll see the patterns emerge.
[19:47:51] <iridium__> node1: what you mentioned is one such pattern. try to find it on your own instead of memorising it.
[19:48:31] <node1> iridium__, Yes i will do that
[19:48:48] <InPhase> node1: Sometimes you have to pause a bit.  For instance, imagine a loop that just counts up to a terminal value and does one operation each iteration.  Now quickly tell me the algorithmic order based on the number of bits required to store the terminal integer.

[22:48:22] <Twix> The swiss are weird. No idea which language they speak
[22:48:24] <extern> not to mention the Switzerland
[22:48:40] <extern> which speak even wierder german
[22:49:42] <edgar-rft> switzerland has three official languages (german, french, italian) and *lots* of local dialects
[22:49:44] <Twix> Then there is austria. I think they speak bavarian. I can't understand it either ..
[22:51:46] <edgar-rft> in switzerland they have a ministry that does nothing but making sure that all federal documents are correctly translated into their three official languages (no joke)
