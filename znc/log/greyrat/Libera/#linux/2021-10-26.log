[01:14:26] <dTal> gmcastil: how can you chroot to an ARM sdcard from an x86 desktop without emulation?
[01:14:52] <TJ-> I'd not like to use an SD-Card for building on
[01:15:06] <gmcastil> dTal, oh, i hadn't thought about that....this is why i'm forcing myself to do it all from scratch
[01:15:12] <TJ-> most are not designed for the number of random read-write cycles

[01:15:34] <gmcastil> dTal, so, i guess what i meant is that I'd build everything and install to something like /mnt/my_root_fs or something
[01:15:48] <dTal> gmcastil: To be clear, you absolutely can do that, with Qemu user emulation, and it's a nifty tool

[01:16:07] <dTal> it's really really easy
[01:16:26] <TJ-> gmcastil: qemu-system-arm or qemu-arm-static
[01:16:26] <gmcastil> yeah, ive been told that something like that can be done so i can know its going to work before i deploy to the actual hardware
[01:16:39] <gmcastil> i might need to look into that sooner rather than later then
[01:16:56] <gmcastil> there is a chapter in this book i've been reading on that sort of thing I think at the end (Embedded linux Primer)

[01:17:46] <TJ-> gmcastil: using those qemu tools I can run foreign architecture containers on amd64 hosts and they can sometimes perform better than the native hardware
[01:17:49] <dTal> cross compiling generally involves a native program, generating foreign code
[01:17:51] <gmcastil> as TJ- mentioned, there is a limitation on flash access
[01:18:07] <dTal> your cross build chain should not rely on qemu
[01:18:13] <gmcastil> no, i wouldnt think it would
[01:18:26] <gmcastil> qemu (or whatever the emulator is) would be used to show it works before i deploy to the actual hardware
[01:18:36] <gmcastil> unless qemu doesnt run cross compiled code?
[01:19:01] <TJ-> there's no such thing as cross-compiled code. It's native code no matter how created
[01:19:29] <Thuryn> okay, then.

[01:19:50] <TJ-> that's not cross-compiled though
[01:19:52] <gmcastil> rather than building, flashing, rebooting the board, debugging
[01:20:13] <TJ-> qemu is emulating the foreign instruction set

[01:20:50] <gmcastil> ok, yeah, that's what i was trying to say, but did a poor job of it
[01:21:02] <gmcastil> thanks for the clarification - yeah, getting a qemu setup running would save a lot of time for sure

[10:53:08] <Blondie101010> recyclehero:  `scp` does not offer bandwidth control...  so to do that with it, you'd need to use a separate tool like `tc`, but that is quite complicated to use...  alternatively you could use `rsync` which does have a speed limit

[13:12:37] <lostchild> I have a few linux users on my host, and also I have a few interfaces. I want to assign an interface for each user separately, so that everyone could have 1 assgned per user.  I need definitely to create a separate Routing Table for each user. And set a rule for each user to use a specific RT. I know that after I created RTs I need to assign them to users. And the question is -> ip rule add uidrange 100-200 lookup 123. I found this command, and the last
[13:12:37] <lostchild> 'lookup 123' thing just got me confused. What is that? Is that an RT ?

[13:21:48] <folaht> Thanks for pointing that out.
[13:22:26] <lostchild> TJ-: so basically, it will be enough to create a few RTs and just assign "ip rule add udirange 100-200 table 123" per each user? Should I remove default RT, or priority will be sufficient to manage the traffic correctly?

[13:48:08] *** Joins: spare (~gzxsdvs3n@user/spareproject)
[13:48:31] <katp32> typically you want one extra thread because there's some overhead in starting processes, so if it's the exact number of threads your CPU has it'll not quite be using 100% most of the time

[13:49:06] <swarfega> so the 5600x has 12 threads, so -j 8?

[13:49:23] <katp32> obviously though, you may need to lower it if you want to be doing other things on your system while you compile, or if you run out of memory
[13:49:31] <katp32> swarfega: no, it would be 13
[13:49:37] <katp32> not sure where you got 8 from
[13:49:40] <katp32> 12 + 1 = 13
[13:49:46] <hexnewbie> 14 to avoid the baker's dozen
[13:49:47] <swarfega> im not sure i follow that reasoning
[13:50:49] <hexnewbie> swarfega: If you have 12 processes, they won't be compiling all the time, because times they would perform housecleaning tasks, wait for the disk, etc. To saturate the CPU, you add an extra 13th process, which will be using CPU whenever any of the remaining ones is not using CPU

[17:04:27] <katp32> someone should make an esolang that's impossible to interpret due to *requiring* a solution to the halting problem in order to evaluate any problem written in that esolang

[17:07:17] <hexnewbie> Also, excusing bugs is sometimes justifiable. There have been times where I've been like, this is not doing the correct thing, but it's 10 lines. Doing the correct thing will be 1000 lines and a unit test. We'll simply call it a day. Sometimes; I usually over-engineer *and* get 100 extra bugs in those 1000 lines. But when that actually solves a tangible, real bug, I don't do it

[18:15:52] <Rogach> hexnewbie: The io_uring idea is that it's fully non-blocking by default - you submit recv for example, and the response arrives sometime later. So you get async access already, and so I don't see why one needs to do extra poll().

[20:53:22] <katp32> I'm an amateur, maybe I'm mistaken, but I don't think acceleration directly has anything to do with special relativity, just speed. it's not "altering the curvature of spacetime", the point is that spacetime is relative, spacetime for the earth is not the same as spacetime for the ship

[21:33:05] <dostoyevsky2> Is there something like securely deleting a file on Linux? (So that it will be hard to restore the file)  I am not even sure how easy it would be to restore a file without knowing the path...
[21:33:18] <schillingklaus> ignore is supported by bloated clients
[21:33:31] <NotGuest> what music player do you guys use ?
[21:33:38] <hexnewbie> dostoyevsky2: There is shred. Some filesystems and drives may work with it
[21:33:54] <NotGuest> also is there a tool to download music from youtube by terminal ?
[21:34:01] <dubiago> dostoyevsky2: you could dd /dev/random into the file n number of times, I suppose.
[21:34:11] <hexnewbie> dostoyevsky2: Particularly, non-COW, possibly non-SSD
[21:34:19] <katp32> dubiago: that's what shred does
[21:34:46] <hodapp> NotGuest: see youtube-dl, assuming you've rights to the music in question
[21:34:47] <katp32> NotGuest: for downloading stuff from youtube, they're youtube-dl
[21:34:51] <dostoyevsky2> Ah, and is there a command to undelete a file?
[21:34:57] <katp32> a millisecond too late :P
[21:35:07] <keir> katp32: is that 100% shreds implementation?
[21:35:28] <keir> i thought it just zero'd the file
[21:35:29] <katp32> dostoyevsky2: I... wha? why? I thought you were just trying to delete them securely ;D
[21:35:40] <dubiago> /dev/random would be better than /dev/zero imo
[21:35:44] <katp32> keir: no, it repeatedly write it over with random data and then optionally writes it with zero
[21:36:00] <katp32> see `man shred`
[21:36:12] <dostoyevsky2> katp32: I just wonder if it's actually feasible to globally undelete files if you don't know the filename

[21:37:20] <dubiago> for shred, -z is a final overwrite...it's an option, not a default
[21:37:36] <keir> katp32: i'm familiar with shread. however, the manpage doesn't specify how it overwrites, just that it overwrites
[21:37:51] <keir> s/shread/shred/
[21:38:03] <katp32> keir: that's fair, but the -z option sort of implies that it's not just writing with zeroes, as if that was the case the -z option would be redundant
[21:38:28] <keir> katp32: that conclusion is reasonable
[21:38:29] <dostoyevsky2> I guess for the strings usecase, shred should turn those things you could grep for into random data...

[21:39:09] <_73> why would an init system open `/dev/console` for read/write and then duplicate the file descriptor to descriptors 0, 1, and 2? Is this suggesting that stdin, stdout, and stderr are the same file or do I misunderstand the role of /dev/console?
[21:39:10] <ananke> meh, shred -n 0 -z is enough [tm]

[23:23:35] <fuzzybear3965> matsaman I'm on Pop using 5.13.0-7614-generic
[23:23:40] <matsaman> fuzzybear3965: there's kernel, userland, and configs, that's all
[23:23:56] <matsaman> fuzzybear3965: you could try taking pop's kernel and boot that in your non-functioning installation
[23:24:22] <fuzzybear3965> matsaman There's also X11 modules, right?
[23:24:29] <fuzzybear3965> And X11 drivers?
[23:24:43] <matsaman> sure, and they are part of either the kernel or the userland

[23:25:59] <matsaman> fuzzybear3965: if you try the ubuntu/pop kernel with nonworking system and it works, then it was in the kernel, the difference
[23:26:04] <nomagno> Is getting analog input to a terminal by asking the user to activate a driver that writes to a FIFO file in a very specific format a good enough idea?
[23:26:20] *** Quits: curvv (~quetzlcoa@user/curvv) (Client Quit)

[23:26:54] <matsaman> nomagno: better than no format
[23:27:13] <fuzzybear3965> matsaman Are kernel modules a part of user land? Because, they're not in the kernel.
[23:27:29] *** Joins: TheGuestMovie (~TheGuestM@173.231.114.74)

[23:31:51] <matsaman> jr_web_dev: sure you even have a problem yet?
