[04:36:22] <ProfSimm> Let's discuss why people can't shut up about free will in scientific and philosophical discussions. Why do we care about free will, and is there a single concrete definition of it

[04:42:02] <chatguy> hey handsome
[04:42:17] <Delf> You said my response wasn't the most emotionally intelligent response
[04:42:22] <chatguy> right
[04:42:30] <LordOfLive> Yo chatguy
[04:42:37] <Delf> I can't fucking handle my response not being most emotionally intelligent response!
[04:42:49] <Delf> It has to be!
[04:42:50] <chatguy> that's because you're not very emotionally intelligent
[04:42:51] <xx> you should work on yourself then
[04:43:00] <LordOfLive> I tried hitting you back but it wouldn’t sends
[04:43:03] <LordOfLive> Send
[04:43:15] <chatguy> but, as i said, this is irc: no one here has emotional intelligence (for the most part)
[04:43:28] <chatguy> and the eq levels in real life are only slightly higher, and that is out of necessity
[04:43:31] <Delf> xx: What if that ends up making me change my mind about breeding?
[04:43:53] <xx> Delf: I'd prefer you don't change your mind about breeding, but it's up to you

[04:44:48] <chatguy> hi dude12312414
[04:45:05] <xx> whether I'd breed or not would have zero effect on my continued existence anyway, since my existence ends when I die

[04:46:40] <chatguy> hard to tell sometimes. most humans are rather sociopathic
[04:46:49] <Delf> Potatoes has chromosomes too?
[04:47:15] <chatguy> if humanity is reduced to molecules then there really is no value in being human
[04:47:59] <Delf> Why stop there? Reduce them to atoms

[04:50:09] <chatguy> dude12312414 no, I don't think so
[04:51:30] <Delf> xx: We've gone from humans not having any value to humans having value depending on how fast they can be replaced
[04:52:15] <xx> Delf: two different values
[04:52:16] <dude12312414> i see
[04:52:23] <xx> one is intrinsic value, which they have none

[04:52:55] <Delf> What give it away, xx?

[05:00:08] *** Joins: kish` (~aqua@user/aqua)
[05:00:12] <causative> just to be clear, when people say humans have no intrinsic value, they're saying there's nothing intrinsically wrong with murdering innocent people for your own enjoyment
[05:00:31] <chatguy> there's nothing intrinsically wrong with anything
[05:00:34] <chatguy> it's all atoms, remember
[05:00:45] <Delf> causative: It's wrong because it's illegal
[05:00:51] <chatguy> lol
[05:01:03] <causative> and when you say that, you are saying, *specifically*, it's not intrinsically wrong to murder people for your enjoyment
[05:01:23] <causative> a lot is hidden by that word "anything"; it is better to be more specific.  You're saying murder is okay.
[05:01:41] <chatguy> everything is what it is. you are free to judge anything as you choose
[05:01:48] <chatguy> your mind makes it wrong
[05:02:00] <Delf> causative: I'm trying to figure out xx
[05:02:29] <causative> chatguy, and how do you judge murder?  do you judge it is okay?
[05:02:57] <chatguy> I have no judgement about it
[05:03:01] <chatguy> is it murder to kill an animal?
[05:03:05] <chatguy> is it murder to kill a fetus?
[05:03:12] <chatguy> is it murder to kill an enemy in warfare?
[05:03:17] <chatguy> is it murder to kill an attacker?
[05:03:22] <causative> no
[05:03:27] <chatguy> is it murder to kill the man who raped your wife?
[05:03:30] <Delf> Murder is when you kill another human, outside war and not as a defense
[05:03:42] <causative> look, stop trying to deflect to "easy" cases
[05:03:58] <causative> when I am saying murder is wrong I am referring to the worst possible forms of murder
[05:03:58] <xx> Delf: what's there to figure out?
[05:04:00] <chatguy> everyone has a reason for what they do. you may not think it's a good reason
[05:04:07] <Delf> xx: There is you to figure out
[05:04:07] <chatguy> you determine what is good and bad
[05:04:25] <xx> chatguy: there's no good and bad
[05:04:39] <chatguy> so if i am raped and beaten and tortured as a child for years and turn into a psychopathic serial killer, that is wrong?
[05:04:42] <causative> for example, torturing and killing an innocent child purely because you derive enjoyment from it.  Are you saying you have no judgment about this act?
[05:04:49] <causative> you don't judge it is wrong?
[05:04:59] <xx> chatguy: don't see anything wrong about it. It's just something that happens.
[05:04:59] <Delf> If you turn into a psychotic serial killer? Yes that's wrong
[05:04:59] <chatguy> who did it and why? were they raped and tortured as a child?
[05:05:15] <chatguy> well, Delf, let's see what happens if you are put in that situation

[05:06:23] <Delf> My condolences if that has happened to you btw
[05:06:40] <causative> suppose, for instance, you have a a button you can press that will prevent 10 innocent children from being tortured and murdered by psychopaths. The button sends information to law enforcement to stop the psychopaths, with no benefit or credit to you personally. Do you press the button or do you not care?
[05:06:49] <chatguy> condolences without understanding and compassion are not that meaningful tbh
[05:06:57] <causative> you have no judgment, so you don't care?
[05:07:05] <chatguy> I'm not in a position to judge innocence, causative
[05:07:10] <causative> you think what the psychopaths are going to do is not wrong, so you don't press the button?
[05:07:11] <Delf> I'd spam the shitts out of that button
[05:07:31] <chatguy> causative I would prob press the button, but without judgement (if possible)
[05:07:49] <causative> you can't act "without judgment"
[05:07:52] <Delf> Why would you press it?
[05:07:53] <causative> if you act, you are making a judgment

[05:08:11] <Delf> Why?
[05:08:22] <chatguy> Delf I don't like how it feels
[05:08:35] <chatguy> Delf I have empathy
[05:08:40] <Delf> Nice
[05:08:48] <causative> then don't say nothing matters
[05:08:52] <causative> it does matter to you
[05:09:07] <chatguy> I didn't say nothing matters. I said nothing is intrinsically wrong. you make judgements.
[05:09:11] <chatguy> of course things matter to you
[05:09:11] <Delf> chatguy: I'd press the button, even if I felt nothing at all. How about that...

[05:09:56] <causative> and if your judgment is that something is intrinsically wrong?
[05:10:06] <chatguy> the fact is that we all have access to such a button every day, but few press it
[05:10:21] <chatguy> causative I am not in a position to judge something as "intrinsically wrong"
[05:10:25] <chatguy> I'm not that arrogant or deluded
[05:11:08] <causative> well, you judge things are wrong, even if you don't want to use the word "intrinsically"
[05:11:11] <Delf> You leave that part to me
[05:11:16] <causative> you judge that murder is wrong
[05:11:27] <Delf> No
[05:11:34] <Delf> They do not like what it feels like
[05:11:40] <chatguy> causative. best not tell me what i do, especially without evidence. I make my own judgements. they are simply my personal opinions.
[05:11:41] <Delf> Murder is not wrong, it's conditional
[05:11:51] <Delf> This is why the previous examples were provided
[05:11:56] <causative> you've got to own your opinions, or else it's dishonest
[05:12:21] <chatguy> caustive, again with telling me what to do. i have opinions. never disowned them.
[05:12:22] <causative> you can't say "I think X, but it's just my opinion so an opinion of not-X could be equally valid."
[05:12:26] <causative> that's dishonest
[05:12:38] <causative> if you think X, you think X.  That means you think opinions of not-X are NOT valid.
[05:12:47] <causative> that's what it means to think X
[05:12:52] <Delf> There are exceptions
[05:13:18] <chatguy> in my opinion chocolate is better than strawberry. if someone thinks strawberry is better then I accept that for them that is the case
[05:13:23] <Delf> For you, murder is wrong, causative. But even you can commit murder, if you give me enough time
[05:13:44] <chatguy> I am not so arrogant or delusional as to believe that my opinions have absolute value
[05:13:47] <causative> that's just equivocation chatguy
[05:13:59] <causative> you don't really think chocolate is better than strawberry
[05:14:06] <causative> you think chocolate tastes better to you
[05:14:09] <chatguy> but I am happy to express my opinions. and I have strong opinions on certain issues
[05:14:10] <causative> not the same thing
[05:14:27] <Delf> What're the strongest opinion you have?
[05:14:54] <chatguy> my strongest opinion is probably about libertarianism and the right to bodily autonomy
[05:15:13] <causative> and your opinion on murder is not "murder (of others) is unpleasant for me."
[05:15:34] <causative> it's "murder is bad."
[05:15:46] <chatguy> i personally don't care about murder. i think most people are murderers. most people eat meat.
[05:16:01] <causative> that's not the definition of murder, again you're trying to deflect to "easier" cases
[05:16:03] <Delf> Bodily autonomy?
[05:16:16] <causative> but I said earlier I'm talking about the *worst* possible types of murder, murder of innocents for the murderer's pleasure
[05:16:25] <causative> talk about that, not about cows or chickens
[05:16:50] <Delf> Murder of non-innocents is still murder, right?
[05:16:58] <chatguy> it's not for me to determine who is "innocent"
[05:17:05] <chatguy> once you accept reincarnation and karma then all bets are off
[05:17:13] <chatguy> animals are innocent in my view
[05:17:14] <causative> come on, stop trying to deflect
[05:17:19] <causative> the worst possible type of murder
[05:17:27] <Delf> That one is no fun
[05:17:36] <chatguy> maybe the person who suffers the worst kind of murder performed the worst kind of murder in the previous lifetime
[05:17:38] <Delf> Murdering innocent people is not fun
[05:17:42] <chatguy> and they are getting their just desserts
[05:17:53] <causative> the difference between "murder is bad" and "murder of others is unpleasant for me" can be seen by the following scenario.  Say there is one button that will prevent a murder.  Another button will make you forget all about the murder and also give you $10. You can only press one button.
[05:18:13] <causative> if your only opinion is "murder is unpleasant for me," then pressing the second button will eliminate the unpleasantness for you, and give you $10.
[05:18:28] <Delf> You get to get rewarded for forgetting?
[05:18:34] <causative> the only reason to press the first button would be if you think there is something wrong about murder that goes beyond just how unpleasant it is for you to think about
[05:18:59] <Delf> He's got to have too much money too
[05:19:39] <causative> so, which button?
[05:19:55] <Delf> Cheap dignity if his getting paid only $10 per sitting
[05:21:07] <Delf> chatguy: You cannot use previous lives and karma to justify stuff...
[05:21:22] <chatguy> Delf I didn't justify anything

[05:22:23] <chatguy> oh?

[05:23:24] <chatguy> we learn through consequences
[05:23:30] <chatguy> and we atone through balance
[05:23:34] <Delf> No
[05:24:14] <Delf> Shifting the consequences about and using previous lives to "make it fit" is not acceptable
[05:24:24] <inhahe_> "Two wrongs make a right" isn't balance

[05:25:27] <chatguy> what question?
[05:25:33] <Delf> Which button!
[05:26:06] <chatguy> i said i'd prob press the button to save the kids
[05:26:16] <Delf> Thanks you
[05:26:17] <causative> no, this is another button scenario
[05:26:25] <causative> not the previous one
[05:26:33] <chatguy> remind me, pls
[05:26:38] <causative> <causative> the difference between "murder is bad" and "murder of others is unpleasant for me" can be seen by the following scenario.

[05:27:13] <chatguy> that is also based on a misunderstanding of what i said
[05:27:27] <causative> before you tell me how I've misunderstood you, please tell me which button
[05:27:55] <chatguy> if there is a button that prevents an unspecified murder, i don't know. that murder might be of an animal to feed someone's family
[05:28:03] <causative> omg this again
[05:28:07] <chatguy> it might be of a fetus to prevent someone from becoming homeless
[05:28:11] <Delf> Hahahh
[05:28:12] <causative> it prevents *the worst possible type of murder you can think of*
[05:28:32] <causative> stop talking about killing fetuses and animals and reincarnated villains
[05:28:46] <chatguy> i notice you have no response to any of those challenges
[05:28:58] <causative> I literally just responded
[05:29:05] <chatguy> ur really dealing with a comic book version of reality
[05:29:11] <chatguy> it's pretty pathetic
[05:30:21] <Delf> He provided the kind of murder
[05:30:37] <Delf> Unspecified in the sense that we have no fucking idea who's killing whom except that it's an innocent person getting killed
[05:31:07] <chatguy> I don't necessarily believe in innocence
[05:31:24] <Delf> What about deserving?
[05:31:26] <chatguy> how about this. do you have money in your bank account? if you use that money (or part of it) to feed starving children you will save their lives
[05:31:27] <chatguy> do you do it?
[05:31:37] <chatguy> maybe we all get what we deserve
[05:32:00] <Delf> You have no idea how many people I've fed
[05:32:11] <chatguy> it was a question

[05:35:44] <causative> chatguy, it's intellectually dishonest to first intentionally misinterpret what the other person has said - as if I was talking about killing fetuses or chickens, which I'd already said I was not - and second to refuse to answer their question about your position
[05:36:09] <chatguy> I consider killing animals and fetuses as murder, if there is any murder
[05:36:32] <Delf> Do you eat animals too?
[05:37:36] <chatguy> I do. I am a sinful person
[05:37:38] <Delf> causative: They have their own definition of what the word murder means, we cannot force them to use ours

[05:39:06] <chatguy> i'm not god, so it's not for me to judge. i am only entitled to my own opinions based on my own reasoning and experience
[05:39:33] <Delf> Because that one they're experienced with and they know their position with it, causative. Not because of malicious intent
[05:40:00] <chatguy> my main gripe is with human ignorance, which is endemic. and i seriously doubt anyone here is free from ignorance.
[05:40:21] <chatguy> if we lived in a less ignorant society, then a lot of crimes would never occur because people wouldn't be desperate and deranged
[05:40:54] <Delf> Did you know, I'm not god either, but when it comes to critical things and the things regarding values, I am the prime authority, I make the judgements
[05:41:15] <mrdata> if laws were logical, people would trust government more
[05:41:20] <chatguy> that doesn't mean i don't believe in "evil" (per se), but I am not so self-righteous as to think that I am beyond evil
[05:41:30] <chatguy> most people are evil, in my view
[05:41:33] <chatguy> (myself included)

[06:35:35] <yanmaani> Hello! I have some questions regarding Karl Popper's paradox of tolerance.
[06:35:49] <chatguy> ask Delf. He wants to answer questions
[06:35:54] <yanmaani> 1) Is the Paradox of Tolerance a utilitarian or deontological argument?
[06:36:09] *** Geronimo2 is now known as Geronimo
[06:36:17] <yanmaani> 2) If the former, is there anything putting a stop to it? Or can whatever actions are expedient be done?
[06:36:54] <yanmaani> (For example, from what does Popper get the limitation he describes? Because it would not be justified from the utilitarian PoV?)
[06:38:00] <yanmaani> 3) More concretely, at what point does the 'intolerance' kick in? For example, if it is utilitarian, are politically harmless but aesthetically/morally unpleasant e.g. skinhead thugs excluded?
[06:38:51] <LordOfLive> whats the question Delf

[08:02:48] <Delf> But you wouldn't consider me unreasonable now would you, causative?
[08:03:36] <causative> in this sense, it's difficult to say who is truly reasonable
[08:03:45] <causative> perhaps not me or you
[08:04:21] <causative> because we're using "reasonable" in this context as the type of thinker who will eventually come to the truth given enough time and information
[08:04:22] <Delf> Once we know the requirements of "sufficient"
[08:04:34] <causative> "sufficient" could be a million years
[08:04:37] <causative> this is a *definition* of truth
[08:05:03] <causative> the reasoner can't be limited by practicalities like the human lifespan, because we're trusting him to eventually come to the truth, whatever it may be or however hard it may be to understand
[08:05:06] <Delf> That's the thing. It could take me 5 years of thinking where as it could take you less than 4 minutes
[08:06:38] <Delf> There are too many unnecessary variables for me to consider which is why I keep it simple. I don't have the brainballs
[08:07:17] <causative> in time, with dedication, the limitation of not being able to handle enough variables can be overcome by using pen and paper to write down and formally manipulate what you can't remember
[08:08:08] <Delf> Yes, I've tried that with thought bubbles or mind maps

[08:09:06] <mannequin> well the reason is, i hate brushing hair

[11:47:43] <chatguy> hi
[11:48:08] <sweetsymph> Yeah life can be fucked up, but you'll be ok I hope
[11:48:16] <sweetsymph> Hi
[11:48:45] * brigand hugs chatguy
[11:48:49] <brigand> hi all
[11:49:00] <chatguy> thanks brigand. that's sweet of you
[11:49:06] <brigand> :)
[11:49:23] <arryana> wow, sorry to hear you lost your arms and legs
[11:50:10] <brigand> just ignore her
[11:54:14] <arryana> when i was very young, i had a professor who had a suggestion for students who were overwhelmed with their problems
[11:54:18] <arryana> maybe it'll help you.
[11:54:46] <arryana> he gave those students a four inch by four inch piece of paper, and asked them to write all their problems on it.
[11:55:48] <arryana> then he'd hold the paper just past their noses and asked them what they saw.  inevitably, the answer was 'my problems'.  then he'd move the paper away from them a few inches, and ask again.  the answer was 'paper with my problems on it' and with a bit more prompting, the other things in the room they could see around the edges of their problem-paper
[11:56:01] <arryana> then he'd move it back again, and ask again.  the answer was always 'more of the room'
[11:56:26] <arryana> then he'd point out that what we focus on is most of what we see, and the more closely we hold it, the more it's all we can see.

[12:08:19] <chatguy> you may have good intentions, but you are very unskilful
[12:08:26] <trbp> question is that loss of arms and legs real?

[12:10:06] <chatguy> people who "try to help" people they don't know often figure themselves as quite skilful counsellers
[12:10:12] <chatguy> they are usually delusional
[12:10:21] <trbp> chatguy: interesting observation
[12:10:33] <trbp> may i tell you my observation?
[12:10:45] <trbp> in my eyes anybody can be therapist
[12:10:58] <trbp> or counseller be it educated or not
[12:10:59] <sweetsymph> Then screw up the peice of paper and throw it at the professor
[12:11:03] <sweetsymph> Sorry joke
[12:11:13] <trbp> in fact most of the educated i saw/talked with
[12:11:18] <trbp> need therapy themself ;)
[12:11:34] <trbp> ever more than their poor patients ;) but well that is another story
[12:11:53] <trbp> sweetsymph: not so bad, if that works with you
[12:11:54] <brigand> this zen talking can be infuriating sometimes. but maybe she's right
[12:11:54] <sweetsymph> Maybe many want to help it is hard to know know right words to say
[12:12:12] <chatguy> it's not that hard
[12:12:47] <brigand> but so many words. just say "look at the bigger picture"
[12:12:54] <trbp> brigand: she?
[12:13:02] <brigand> arryana
[12:13:19] <trbp> brigand: that is the usual approach to such things from outside
[12:14:33] <trbp> of course inside it is difficult to see that one, and a more "professional person" (what ever that is, would wait for reinputs/conclusions) but we are all just human
[12:14:52] <trbp> brigand, i see ;)
[12:14:52] <brigand> ya. and this is just chat
[12:16:40] <brigand> when you're in pain or trouble you may not be able to look outside. but when someone says "you're not the only person in the world" it feels like insult to injury
[12:17:00] <trbp> true
[12:17:08] <chatguy> most ppl have low eq
[12:17:14] <chatguy> arrayana is no exception
[12:17:35] <trbp> but still without that input the person may stand in her/his selfchoosen corner forever
[12:17:58] <trbp> chatguy: i would not go as far as to question someones eq based on only some sentences in a chat
[12:18:21] <brigand> chatguy: i think she mentioned that she took in some people and animals, and does voluntary work
[12:18:43] <chatguy> doesn't translate to high eq
[12:18:43] <trbp> chatguy: but that what brigand says goes obviously with you, you do not feel well and do not want any kind of cheering
[12:19:24] <brigand> i think she's more fed up with crying people as she maybe sees "the bigger picture" idk

[12:20:59] <trbp> and another person wanted to relativate this
[12:21:06] <trbp> which was not accepted
[12:21:11] <trbp> end of story .
[12:21:23] <trbp> though what arryana said is right
[12:22:30] <brigand> i saw her do it a few times
[12:22:32] <trbp> if on such kind of social answer/input there follows that kind of reaction/answer, there will be no difference at all in the long run, or worse maybe all will one by one referr from further contact
[12:23:03] <brigand> maybe she put him on /ignore. she's known for this
[12:24:09] <trbp> maybe we should stop thinking about what arryana wants/does/said but just get back to the thing that is plain to read, or let it stand there as is? ;)

[17:43:54] <arcturus> the proposition has to be clearer
[17:44:08] <ProfSimm> I just set the bar quite low
[17:44:16] <ProfSimm> Can't set it lower.
[17:45:54] * pussipupu throws scones at arryana
[17:46:35] <ProfSimm> I'll be specific. Regardless of what "free" means, "will" implies intent.
[17:46:47] <pussipupu> I don't know what you think it's a reasonable definition, and I'm not a proponent of fundamental randomness or any strong meaning of free will so I'll pass thanks.
[17:46:50] <ProfSimm> The very definition of "random" excludes intent.
[17:47:02] <ProfSimm> If it has intent, the intent caused it, it's not random.
[17:47:05] <ProfSimm> Random means without cause.

[17:49:04] <ProfSimm> Epic
[17:49:45] <pussipupu> I assume people will catch them
[17:50:05] <ProfSimm> pussipupu: fundamental randomness has one benefit, it can bootstrap the universe from nothing. So I guess the question is, do we think the universe made itself or not.
[17:50:28] <ProfSimm> Any explanation of "X made it" would turn around and require explanation for "who made X"
[17:50:42] <ProfSimm> We can accept time loops.
[17:50:49] <ProfSimm> So the universe made itself without randomness.
[17:51:00] <ProfSimm> But causal loops are semantically problematic
[17:53:20] <pussipupu> I'm neutral on the origin of the universe, if there even is such a thing
[17:55:41] <pussipupu>  And to be honest I don't understand what you're claiming about randomness bootstrapping the universe
[17:55:48] *** Joins: kmh (~kmh@2a00:6020:5004:6800:9881:9737:5341:5446)
[17:55:53] <ProfSimm> pussipupu: I'm neutral too, but being neutral doesn't stop us from realizing that not knowing is a problem
[17:56:05] <ProfSimm> pussipupu: I'll explain in a bit
[18:10:16] * arryana pushes tea to pussipupu to go with the scones
[18:10:55] * Lumine replaces the tea with alcohol
[18:10:58] <arryana> haha
[18:11:00] <arryana> woo!
[18:11:09] <pussipupu> Excellent, cheers
[18:11:11] * pussipupu keeps both
[18:11:18] <arryana> haha
[18:11:50] <arryana> scones would be brilliant
[18:12:35] <arryana> i think lunch here is likely to be what the kids of one of my friends calls 'green fish'
[18:13:43] <ProfSimm> pussipupu: by randomness bootstrapping the universe I mean that every effect has a cause. The only causeless effect is true randomness. Therefore it's the only possible initial cause.
[18:14:28] <ProfSimm> pussipupu: of course we can falsify this by thinking about cause and effect, beginning of time. Those are assumptions. Quantum mechanics are time-symmetric, mostly. Means cause and effect trade places when you play the timeline in reverse.
[18:14:32] <pussipupu> I had a kebab for lunch
[18:14:38] <arryana> ooh
[18:15:20] <pussipupu> one day I'll find a Finnish kebab house that knows what "hot" means in the context of sauce
[18:15:33] *** Quits: amigojapan (uid86330@id-86330.helmsley.irccloud.com) ()
[18:15:54] <arryana> not spicy there?  is there any finnish food that is?
[18:18:35] <pussipupu> ProfSimm: Honestly I'm not sure I see how it could be meaningful for the universe(in the most total sense of the word) to "begin"
[18:18:57] <pussipupu> There's good Thai food here, if you find the right place
[18:20:11] <pussipupu> The “native” cuisine isn't generally spicy though, and the mustard is weirdly sweet
[18:20:31] <ProfSimm> pussipupu: well, we don't know either way, but conservation of energy implies finite space and time. Otherwise what are you conserving exactly, if either of those is infinite.
[18:21:05] *** Quits: sweetsymph (uid509475@id-509475.lymington.irccloud.com) ()
[18:21:06] <ProfSimm> pussipupu: furthermore everything in the universe we've seen so far, has a beginning and an end
[18:21:22] <ProfSimm> pussipupu: so to make an exception for the universe seems statistically unwarranted
[18:22:06] <arryana> i love that sort of cultural difference
[18:22:08] <pussipupu> I don't follow your objection to conservation laws in infinite contexts
[18:22:45] <ProfSimm> pussipupu: you have infinite energy, what are you conserving exactly.
[18:22:51] <pussipupu> When I am emperor, I will encourage more people to travel the world and open restaurants(and clothes shops and all sorts of culturally informed things)
[18:23:04] <pussipupu> You are not creating or destroying energy
[18:23:07] <arryana> i, for one, welcome you as the new overlord
[18:23:25] <ProfSimm> pussipupu: creating and destroying is meaningless with infinite energy
[18:23:43] <pussipupu> I don't accept that claim
[18:24:01] <ProfSimm> pussipupu: well. Let's say I give you infinite beans. And tell you "make sure their count doesn't change"
[18:24:10] <ProfSimm> What did I just tell you
[18:24:20] <ProfSimm> Non-sequitur
[18:24:50] <pussipupu> Changing the total count isn't what I said by not creating or destroying
[18:24:51] <arryana> i loved working at a vietnamese restaurant when i was young.  that is some -seriously- hot food, culturally
[18:24:52] <ProfSimm> You can't figure out the count of infinite beans, you can make no claims the count changed, you can make no claims the count didn't change
[18:25:07] <arryana> what they served in general was not as spicy as the kitchen staff ate when they cooked after hours
[18:25:24] <ProfSimm> pussipupu: well creating and destroying implies changing the "count" of energy in any arbitrary unit
[18:25:53] <pussipupu> Not if the amount is transfinite it doesn't
[18:26:06] <pussipupu> aleph-null + 7 = aleph-null
[18:26:50] <ProfSimm> pussipupu: it's very easy to imagine aleph-null in the abstract, like it's easy to imagine a perfect circle. Neither can be found in reality
[18:28:16] <ProfSimm> pussipupu: on top of energy conservation being meaningless in an infinite universe, information preservation also ceases to make sense.
[18:29:03] <ProfSimm> pussipupu: infinite information implies all possible states exist on equal terms, there's nothing to preserve. And a universe without boundaries doesn't contain its information
[18:29:58] <ProfSimm> pussipupu: infinities are just our brain throwing exceptions. We can pile on top of the exception and build meta-infinities and so on.
[18:30:05] <ProfSimm> I don't see how this makes them real.
[18:30:53] <arryana> did you finish the article, lumine?
[18:31:36] <Lumine> Not even close
[18:31:43] <arryana> aw
[18:32:09] <Lumine> I've been writing it, but it's going to be long
[18:32:14] <Lumine> Real long
[18:32:46] <pussipupu> I don't agree that infinities are "easy to imagine", though they're possible to reason with, an infinite universe doesn't necessarily imply infinite information needed to describe it(though I don't see your objection to that either to be honest)
[18:33:28] <pussipupu> I don't think conservation of information is a settled question even if it were a problem, q.v. the entropic gradient of time
[18:41:28] <ProfSimm> pussipupu: they're easy to imagine because imagination can be abstract and overlook pesky gaps
[18:41:51] <ProfSimm> pussipupu: say when you imagine a circle you don't concern yourself with what it's made of
[18:42:09] <ProfSimm> pussipupu: neither you're concerned per se what are the exact contents of an infinity
[18:42:51] <ProfSimm> pussipupu: the entropic gradient of time seems to come from a point in the past with very low entropy.
[18:43:03] <ProfSimm> I'm unsure it's a property of time as we experience it per se
[18:47:16] <pussipupu> I understand that you reject various infinities, but I don't see a compelling argument against them as I've outlined
[18:47:23] <pussipupu> Maybe we should just agree to disagree on the issue
[18:47:46] <arryana> do you think it matters what age someone travels internationally, pussipupu?
[18:48:33] <pussipupu> Honestly I think that if it can be done safely, it's best to travel early and ideally to more foreign places
[18:48:44] * arryana nods
[18:48:50] <pussipupu> As in places which are more foreign, more distal culturally(parallax4life)
[18:49:10] <pussipupu> Though I say that as someone who is old and has never left Europe :þ
[18:49:22] <arryana> seeing how differently people can live and still have things function
[18:50:11] <pussipupu> Yeah, which can help to fuel the search for improvements to one's own homeland(whether born or adoptive)
[18:50:30] * arryana nods
[18:50:32] <pussipupu> And just generally richness of experience is something I value
[18:50:41] <arryana> sometimes i fear it goes the other way too
[18:51:02] <arryana> the uk is getting frighteningly close to suggesting the nhs be scrapped for an american style insurance system
[18:51:06] <pussipupu> I'm not sure I follow, how so?
[18:51:19] <arryana> it'd be a tragedy
[18:51:24] <pussipupu> Ah, it's definitely possible to adopt stupid ideas from abroad :þ
[18:52:23] <pussipupu> But the Tories have historically been pretty stable in wanting to entrench power gradients, and destroying the NHS is part of that project IMO
[18:52:46] <pussipupu> I struggle to understand the Tory mindset(either in terms of their heirarchs or to be honest their voters)
[18:53:17] <arryana> sadly, to me it appears to be personal profit and cronyism
[18:53:54] <pussipupu> Certainly that's a large part of it, at least for the powers that be
[18:54:16] <pussipupu> But that to me seems to imply an increadible paucity of outlook
[18:54:42] <arryana> i find it more than a little unfortunate
[18:56:00] <pussipupu> I worry also to be honest that if/when Scotland gets Indie the SNP will show themselves as a very small-c conservative party and keep getting power
[18:57:28] <arryana> i guess i'm hoping scotland splits off and adopts a nordic model
[18:58:27] <pussipupu> Well, me too, I just don't know that I see it happening
[18:58:54] <arryana> it won't happen soon.  but it would be nice if it did.
[19:02:11] <arryana> the optimist in me likes to believe that ireland and wales would follow
[19:05:19] <pussipupu> I'd like to see England do it too to be fair :p
[19:05:28] <arryana> yeah, but they'd be last
[19:05:41] <arryana> they're actively moving in the other direction at the moment
[19:07:11] <pussipupu> and the constitution fights progress even aside from the specific parties we elect
[19:07:24] * arryana nods
