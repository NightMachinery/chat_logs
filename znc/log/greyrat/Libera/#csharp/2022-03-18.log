[00:32:18] * MatthiasVance is pondering whether GCP is a good alternative to Azure
[00:33:20] <irwiss> narrator: it was not :P
[00:33:43] <JakeSays> MatthiasVance: why?
[00:34:32] <MatthiasVance> irwiss: Why not? :D
[00:34:57] <MatthiasVance> JakeSays: Just want to be aware of differences. Customer of ours uses GCP exclusively, I use Azure myself
[00:35:29] <JakeSays> MatthiasVance: i've thought about using gcp for my own stuff
[00:36:29] <irwiss> MatthiasVance: in our short (3 month) experience you have 0 chance of reaching non-bot support if anything goes wrong
[00:38:21] <JakeSays> irwiss: oh?
[00:40:13] <irwiss> we had instance group that couldn't be deleted for some reason, took over 2 weeks of emails to get past walls of bots, precanned emails and low level support who couldn't do anything
[00:40:14] <JakeSays> ms blocked my azure account because i owed them $.77.
[00:42:05] <bomb> we can set up a debt payment plan for you JakeSays
[00:42:19] <JakeSays> bomb: lol
[00:42:48] <lz_> irwiss: how does that compare to azure though? was it any better ?
[00:43:20] <JakeSays> it was a monthly charge for an azure sphere device connection. then they deleted the device because i wasn't using t, so now there's no record of the $.77 owed, yet the account is locked. i opened a ticket but they couldn't handle it

[00:46:27] <bomb> you see the Top Gun 2 trailer?
[00:46:34] <MatthiasVance> That is 40 years ago JakeSays ...
[00:46:44] <MatthiasVance> So .. yeah ..
[00:46:50] <JakeSays> MatthiasVance: no way
[00:47:09] <JakeSays> what year was the movie released?
[00:47:16] <bomb> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSqVVswa420
[00:47:17] <MatthiasVance> '86
[00:47:28] <bomb> F-18 hornets in the new movie
[00:47:30] <MatthiasVance> 36, but still ;p
[00:47:31] <JakeSays> MatthiasVance: that is NOT 40, dammit
[00:47:55] <lz_> why does watching youtube videos from my subscriptions feels like a chore?
[00:48:00] <JakeSays> i graduated high school in '85
[00:48:02] <MatthiasVance> I know right I'm from '87, DEFINITELY NOT 40 YEARS AGO
[00:48:07] <JakeSays> so every year counts!
[00:48:34] <MatthiasVance> Also fuck does that mean I'll be 36 this year.. I fucked up my goals :(
[00:48:50] <lz_> MatthiasVance: don't worry it's all downhill from here
[00:48:56] <JakeSays> LOL
[00:49:10] <JakeSays> dude.. dont talk to me about fucked up goals
[00:49:20] * JakeSays puts up the hand
[00:49:26] <MatthiasVance> lz_: No I just took a detour because of a fucked up company I made the mistake of joining, so instead of 📈 I wasn't doing much of anything
[00:49:43] <MatthiasVance> TWICE
[00:49:46] <JakeSays> MatthiasVance: instead of what?
[00:50:03] <lz_> instead of what? it's not showing the character on my client
[00:51:02] <MatthiasVance> I was in a leadership position and was planning on growing further in that area but first company was planning to hire an entire team, but didn't .. second one wanted a CTO .. but didn't..
[00:51:15] <JakeSays> ah
[00:51:20] <lz_> oh ok
[00:51:30] <MatthiasVance> Both self-obsessed (micro-)managers
[00:51:48] <lz_> best to apply directly to such positions I guess, rather than relying on promises
[00:51:55] <MatthiasVance> I .. did
[00:51:57] <JakeSays> see, the trick is to set completely unrealistic goals that are impossible to achieve.
[00:52:00] <lz_> lol
[00:52:59] <MatthiasVance> It was a CTO position, I got equity and everything .. but then they didn't let me run it in fear of spooking their 1 dev that was their first one and knows the entire system
[00:53:20] <MatthiasVance> (they had more devs, but they only had that person as a concern)
[00:53:22] <MatthiasVance> So, yeah :D
[00:53:22] <lz_> MatthiasVance: at least they didn't hire a retard who took that position from you, like it happened to me
[00:53:41] <MatthiasVance> ah, that's even worse yeah
[00:53:51] <MatthiasVance> What exactly happened lz_ ?
[00:53:56] <lz_> dude always had a big smile and was being nice to every one, but he was fucking bad at his job
[00:54:20] <lz_> they hired him with the intention of promoting him, instead of giving me that position; I was there for like 5 years, had twice his qualifications etc
[00:54:45] <MatthiasVance> Did you also mention to your manager that you would like that position?
[00:55:00] <MatthiasVance> Lots of people get upset about people getting promoted yet haven't put in that part
[00:55:05] <lz_> MatthiasVance: he already made his mind :D when he told me, I asked "is this a fucking joke?" and my resignation letter came the next day
[00:55:48] <MatthiasVance> JakeSays: One thing in GCP vs Azure .. Azure feels way more layered
[00:56:02] <MatthiasVance> lz_: Your manager you mean?
[00:56:19] <lz_> MatthiasVance: yeah
[00:56:22] <lz_> fuck him
[00:56:29] <lz_> fucking piece of shit
[00:57:09] <MatthiasVance> At least at the place where I didn't get to hire a team .. they got rid of the entire business unit that was progressive .. so they could micromanage people overseas .. lot faster results
[00:57:32] <MatthiasVance> (not better though, but that was not their fault)
[00:58:40] <lz_> that shit absolutely gave me trust issues
[00:59:04] <MatthiasVance> lz_: Can imagine =/
[01:10:03] <lz_> MatthiasVance: I cut all contacts with my previous colleagues; but I had a drink with one a couple of years ago. He told me exactly that. The guy is a joke at his job :) Ofc maybe he told me that to be nice, but I'm pretty sure it's a giant mess now
[01:11:24] <lz_> in retrospects I should have quit way, way earlier; almost did at some point
[01:11:47] <lz_> HR was shit
[01:12:22] <lz_> so was IT, and the CTO was harrassing half the team
[01:13:24] <irwiss> lz_: no weird incidents yet
[01:15:22] <lz_> + the few people that were really good already left the company, which just lives on the prestige of its name now

[01:20:36] <lz_> irwiss: that reminds me that I had to wear fucking gloves at this job, because the CTO was a fat pig who always put the temp to -10°C
[01:20:45] <lz_> also he was doing it in our back without admitting it
[01:22:04] <JakeSays> irwiss: offices are always way too hot for me, so i bring my own air conditioner
[01:22:17] <lz_> did I mention I hate him

[02:07:38] <JakeSays> how did you accidentally end up in the er?
[02:07:55] <brianonymous> also a weird fucking story.. but i had thought for sure id broke a rib or someshit, right?
[02:07:55] <DoofusCanadensis> that's where you get sent when you're in an accident
[02:08:37] <brianonymous> so i go to urgent care thinking maybe they will just do an xray and send me back with some supercharged ibuprofin or something
[02:08:54] <brianonymous> for non US - urgent care is just a walk in place with doctors
[02:09:13] <Nasp> Here you need to call and order a time
[02:09:25] <brianonymous> so, i made the huge mistake of telling the doc at urgent care that i had the rona the week prior

[02:09:35] <brianonymous> he walks out
[02:09:47] <lz_> brianonymous: what accident were you in?
[02:09:58] <brianonymous> walks back in and was like 'welp, YOU MIGHT HAVE A DEADLY RONA BASED BLOOD CLOT. we have notified the ER, they are expecting you"
[02:10:19] <DoofusCanadensis> eek
[02:10:19] <lz_> if you think you broke a rib?
[02:10:21] <brianonymous> and there went 6hrs of my life
[02:10:32] <Nasp> brianonymous: Atleast you got help :D
[02:10:49] <JakeSays> brianonymous: damn
[02:10:58] <brianonymous> lz_ well, i was coughing and sneezing quite violently the week before, so it ended up that i pulled the interior muscle of my rib cage or something
[02:11:16] <lz_> oh wow, didn't know it could be this violent
[02:11:20] <brianonymous> it felt like i was being stabbed from the inside every time i took a breath, and i lost my ability to cough and stuff
[02:11:39] <lz_> I understand the doctors were concerned
[02:11:43] <Nasp> brianonymous:  That same feeling can be due to back issues
[02:11:57] <Nasp> I had once pinched a nerve in my back and thought i was dying
[02:11:59] <brianonymous> nasp: it sucked, and was really confusing
[02:12:22] <brianonymous> i went to bed with just some mild soreness, but at 4am i woke up in severe pain
[02:12:37] <brianonymous> and it felt very physical
[02:12:46] <brianonymous> very pin point
[02:12:54] <lz_> Nasp: oh yeah, I had my share of back pains. As brianonymous says, it starts mild, then get horribly worse
[02:13:06] <lz_> in my case I think they were muscle issues
[02:13:22] <lz_> had to crawl on the ground for a while
[02:13:44] <brianonymous> i honestly was just going to stay home, it was my wife that talked me into going to urgent care

[02:14:26] <Nasp> Their number one job is make sure you dont show up
[02:14:29] <lz_> sucks to have a wife I guess. I can die whenever I want and no one will bother me
[02:14:41] <brianonymous> Nasp: what i found weird is that the ER here was practically empty
[02:14:49] <brianonymous> there was like 2 peeps in the waiting room
[02:14:59] <Nasp> ER here is always min 4 hours wait
[02:15:07] <Nasp> Also no triage or anything
[02:15:09] <brianonymous> Nasp: every other time ive been there, thats been the case
[02:15:44] <Nasp> I've been there for 8 hours two times
[02:16:00] <JakeSays> hmm. 128/84

[02:22:40] <JakeSays> i think i use 240

[02:22:44] <brianonymous> it was oscillating between 245-247

I found this method of doing so, "https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/UploadFile/80ae1e/canceling-a-running-task/", however the check only occurs after all body statements of the while loop have executed. If
[02:51:59] <Guest21> cancellation was needed to cease execution of the task the moment .Cancel() was called, I struggle to find a solution.

[04:43:30] <Guest31> Good evening everyone, hope everyone is doing well.  I have been looking for the libraries to interact with Word.  I am looking to convert docx to pdf.  I see there are many paid for solutions, but I am thinking that this should be somewhat a simple task to create.  Can anyone please point me to the libraries that I need to import into my
[04:43:30] <Guest31> project to work with?
[04:44:48] <JakeSays> Guest31: if you have word the simplest approach would be to have word print directly to a pdf

[04:46:30] <Guest31> So, we are doing that currently but the issue is that it is opening up Word and a lot of the time the process isn't quitting and bogging down the server with orphaned processes.  I am looking to rewrite some of it but can't find what libraries I need or any documentation.
[04:47:03] <Guest31> We don't want Word to open at all.
[04:47:20] *** Joins: llanhmod_ (~personnel@user/domhnall/x-2887755)
[04:47:41] <JakeSays> then your best bet is one of those paid solutions.
[04:48:10] <JakeSays> you could always parse the word document and then manually create the pdf, but that can get real difficult real fast
[04:48:31] <JakeSays> i can't think of anything opensource tha would do it
[04:50:05] <Guest31> I was going to look to see if LibreOffice had something, but would rather keep it with Microsoft.  I thought that would have been the best bet, but then again.... Microsoft ;)
[04:52:19] <Guest31> Thank you JakeSays
[04:52:43] <JakeSays> Guest31: how complicated are the documents
[04:53:56] <Guest31> They legal documents that can be up to about 20 pages, but from what I have seen (or have been given to look at) they don't seem that difficult.
[04:54:35] <JakeSays> libreoffice would probably cause similar issues as word is
[04:54:59] <JakeSays> although it's open source so the code could be extracted to work as a library. could be interesting
[04:56:35] <Guest31> I would think this is a common problem to solve, so figured I would drop in and ask.  I haven't found anything on SO or Microsoft that doesn't point to a third-party paid-for service, api, ...   I guess it is  a well kept secret for those handful of companies haha

[05:02:33] <JakeSays> there's also a python lib that would probably be easy to convert to c#333
[05:02:49] <Guest31> it calls the soffice exe or dll.  That is my next stop, to see if this opens up the program in the back end or just calls the method to do the conversion

[09:18:50] <Tripknotix> theres no other value, its just a compare, if it exists inside the array, it doesnt even need to return the value
[09:21:54] <Tripknotix> it will be stored on a c# server as an instance in the cloud. and has a 100ms limit for code execution
[09:25:25] <Tripknotix> hmm appears hashset is the prefered choice for seeing if the code exists
[09:25:29] <Tripknotix> when its a string
[09:27:31] <Tripknotix> its not sorted btw, it was randomly generated, and included 14 digits in the string, of letters numbers and dashes

[11:09:36] <MatthiasVance> It's friday!
[11:10:27] <MatthiasVance> JakeSays: By the way one thing I noticed in GCP logging coming from Azure is that it's not easy (unless you pump the data into Big Query) to query events and whatnot to get a better overview
[11:10:38] <MatthiasVance> So usually when querying logs that feels a lot easier in Azure
[11:12:22] <shadowchaser> MatthiasVance one day you won’t be here and we won’t know it’s Friday:(

[11:30:54] <MatthiasVance> We had a certain thing where we optimized something that ended up costing 10x the monthly cost because initializing the cache would take longer than x seconds which means GCP went "uh oh this is not working, let's kill it"

[12:16:21] <MatthiasVance> Nasp: Also are you on Kubernetes? Have you checked out Cast AI?
[12:26:32] <Nasp> We are not on Kubernetes yet, thats' the next project after .NET 5/6 migration
[12:26:42] <Nasp> MatthiasVance:  Well it's not my problem with the budget
[12:26:55] <Nasp> But if we can't minimize it, i would say it's a big extreme
[12:26:59] <Nasp> Also that's with a 20% discount
[12:27:07] <Nasp> Which i imo think is nothing
[12:29:28] <MatthiasVance> Apparently if you use spot instances with kubernetes you can save a lot of money
[12:29:39] <MatthiasVance> The only "problem" is that you have to account for termination of said instances
[12:38:16] <Nasp> Oh well this is not hosting cost
[12:38:24] <Nasp> This is only the cost for monitoring from datadog
[12:38:38] <Nasp> In general we saved a lot when we moved some of our stuff to google

[16:04:53] <MatthiasVance> So you still get a popup as consumer
[16:05:54] <bomb> MatthiasVance according to what I read on forums, OV sufficient. so it's either SmartScreen thing resolve eventually, or users manage to pass that stage
[16:06:15] <MatthiasVance> Yeah I guess once enough people say "this is fine" you don't get it anymore
[16:06:27] <MatthiasVance> And if you keep renewing the cert for the same org then that's good
[16:06:36] <bomb> yep. for a few weeks antiviruses and even browsers complain
[16:07:17] <bomb> yeah. do you plan to get a cert for individual projects or as company?
[16:09:15] <canton7> Yeah, from what I've read, if you have a non-EV cert, then SmartScreen reputation is attached to the cert rather than to the binary, so your reputation carries over when you sign a new binary with the same cert
[16:09:38] <canton7> But from what I've also read, that reputation disappears when you renew your cert. So if you only do a couple of releases a year (and renew every year), it's pointless

[17:06:33] <smallville7123> int newPointerIdBits = oldPointerIdBits & desiredPointerIdBits;
[17:06:38] <smallville7123> for a List<T>
[17:06:59] <smallville7123> where both oldPointerIdBits and desiredPointerIdBits are List<T>
[17:07:13] <PeterR``> bitwise and on a List?!
[17:07:34] <smallville7123> originally all variables are of type int
[17:07:45] <smallville7123> but i am converting to a list of objects
[17:08:05] <Nasp> anyone knoe if it's possible to make a custom constraints that accepts a List of arguments instead of a fixed number of parameters?
[17:08:34] <smallville7123> Nasp: "param args ... a" i think
[17:09:09] <smallville7123> "a" will be equivilant to a List<object> or something
[17:09:31] <Nasp> I tried that
[17:09:41] <smallville7123> welp
[17:09:48] <Nasp> It may not be supported i think
[17:10:22] <smallville7123> PeterR``: what would       old & wanted     result in if both are int
[17:11:48] <smallville7123> as i have      `if (newPointerIdBits == 0)`      and    `if (newPointerIdBits == oldPointerIdBits)`
[17:12:05] <smallville7123> and then      `split(newPointerIdBits)`
[17:12:51] <smallville7123> would would such equivilant be if `List<object>` was used instead of `int`
[17:13:38] <smallville7123> as unfortunately `Operator '&' cannot be applied to operands of type 'List<object>' and 'List<object>`
[17:14:15] <irwiss> Nasp: may be use code generators to generate the variants or analyzers to verify your varargs types are what you want?
[17:15:50] <smallville7123> would i simply do `List<object> newPointerIdBits = desiredPointerIdBits` `if (newPointerIdBits.Count == 0)` and `if (newPointerIdBits == oldPointerIdBits)`    ?

[19:12:10] <bomb> Russia is the new COVID
[19:12:16] <JakeSays> lol
[19:12:47] <interop_madness> I think the censoring of RT is rather dangerous. I fear that there will be a balkanization of public opinion between Russia and the West, with law-enforced filter bubbles on both sides
[19:13:24] <lz_> bomb: funnily enough, it's the same problem. People don't know who are experts and who aren't. Conspiracy theorists also shift from covid to war in a blink of an eye. Some even say russia is fighting covid in ukraine
[19:14:15] <lz_> this is seriously boring, we need more education
[19:14:39] <interop_madness> Also, it seems impractical to even provide objective criteria by which to censor Russian media. If "propaganda" is the threshold, then how about established Russian media outlets where the journalists now are confronted with the problem that they end up in prison if they don't write the official narrative?
[19:15:26] <Nasp> JakeSays:  Sure, but does that make sense?

[19:18:17] <interop_madness> The real question is: What do we strive to achieve by blocking RT and throwing them off TV stations?
[19:18:28] <interop_madness> As in, what is the actual, tangible goal here?
[19:18:30] <JakeSays> Nasp: the sanctions are against corporations.
[19:18:35] <DevJohnC> given the rise of domestic far right extremism and spread of conspiracy theories online it makes a certain sense to be filtering/censoring pro-russia outlets less public sentiment turn against Ukraine now that the EU is heavily invested in being anti-russia in the conflict
[19:18:57] <lz_> interop_madness: have you been following the news in the US? Russia has been really good at sewing disinformation in the west

[19:32:18] <Miles8of9> not if you play some kgb tricks... baltic states will leave nato on their own will (apparently) and join russia
[19:32:23] <sysRPL> in online auctions i keep having to compete with idiot bidders
[19:32:59] <JakeSays> they won't
[19:33:06] <sysRPL> people are bidding on a 27" monitor with a broken screen because they can't read the description or click through all the images
[19:33:30] <Miles8of9> are you really sure.......? <putin face>
[19:33:39] <JakeSays> but at this point it doesn't matter - we already have troops in several baltic states, so if he attacks he's attacking us.
[19:33:51] <sysRPL> or people are bidding up RAM sticks because they can't bother to research it's ECC server ram
[19:34:06] <bomb> yeah, how's Murrica doing in Afghanistan?
[19:34:11] <bomb> Syria?
[19:34:27] <JakeSays> bomb: i fail to see the relevance
[19:34:30] <bomb> last I saw they were running away
[19:34:39] <bomb> because Russians came
[19:35:05] <Miles8of9> putin will put his men as leaders of those countries....
[19:35:29] <bomb> if you have balls, send troops to Ukraine. or stop acting like USA will save the world LOL
[19:35:35] <Nasp> Putin should just try and sneeze into a NATO country
[19:35:40] <Nasp> And boom, nuclear war
[19:36:07] <JakeSays> Nasp: i think nuclear war is a big long shot
[19:36:08] <lz_> Nasp: I think putin might also start nuking things just by himself
[19:36:25] <Nasp> If he only nuke Ukranian things, then maybe he would get away with it?
[19:36:29] <lz_> Nasp: I can see him drop 1 just to test the water
[19:36:30] <Nasp> Not sure if anyone dares to react
[19:36:32] <sysRPL> and why are people bidding up a used 480GB Kingston SATA SSD to $45 + $10 shipping when the same drive is $55 new on amazon with free shipping
[19:36:35] <Nasp> But else it would be the end of the world
[19:36:35] <Miles8of9> putin is not mad like hitler... he's russian.... he won't attack nato
[19:36:42] <Nasp> 1000 nukes would fly in either direction
[19:37:00] <JakeSays> i think he'll be taken out by his own people if he tries to go nuclear
[19:37:17] <Nasp> I hope so
[19:37:32] <sysRPL> the usa is likely supplying ukraine with lots of the things they are publically denying
[19:37:33] <Miles8of9> he won't use nuclear weapons... he has no need to...
[19:38:07] <lz_> Miles8of9: yes he does. He's running out of conventionnal weapons
[19:38:08] <bomb> sysRPL Ukrainians are out of ammo
[19:38:09] <sysRPL> that's part of war: subterfuge
[19:38:19] <sysRPL> bomb: source please

[19:38:30] <JakeSays> bomb: huh? they're not out of ammo. we just sent them 20 million rounds
[19:38:36] <Miles8of9> no... he's winning the war just by sending untrained soldiers and tremendously old tanks
[19:38:50] <Miles8of9> and he's still winning!
[19:38:51] <JakeSays> Miles8of9: he's not winning the war
[19:39:14] <bomb> JakeSays that's like 4 magazines per soldier
[19:39:16] <Miles8of9> ukrainians are retreating... day by day...

[19:39:53] <JakeSays> Miles8of9: that's not true.
[19:40:25] <JakeSays> bomb: well, there's many millions of rounds yet to be sent.
[19:40:25] <sysRPL> bomb: most of the war is currently being fought with missles, artillery, and aerial bombs
[19:40:36] <JakeSays> one thing we can do is keep him armed.
[19:40:58] <Miles8of9> by not using nuclear weapons the war will last more time... a couple of weeks? 1 more month?

[19:43:31] <lz_> Miles8of9: I'm not a war analyst either, just sharing some experts estimate :)
[19:43:34] <sysRPL> russia lost 15,000 soldiers in all of their afghanistan war during the 80s
[19:44:20] <lz_> Miles8of9: my guess is it will change "nature", less missiles and tanks, but no simple resolve in sight
[19:44:22] <Miles8of9> russian army has 1 million soldiers...
[19:44:28] <sysRPL> so this conflict has lasted 4 weeks so far, and cost russia 50% of the casualties they incurred during 10 years in afghanistan
[19:44:36] <JakeSays> they do not
[19:44:54] <bomb> some people are really detached from the reality
[19:45:05] <lz_> even if putin "wins", there's nothing to win. Unless he wants to remove everyone there
[19:45:12] <JakeSays> some people spend too much time on reddit
[19:46:08] <sysRPL> putin is getting desperate. he has arrested his defense advisors, he i sending his genrals to the front lines, and he has replaced his personal staff for fear of poisoning

[19:47:47] <JakeSays> well, even if those are accurate, it doesn't mean they're any good. he spends almost nothing on defense.
[19:47:56] <lz_> I guess Miles8of9 probably has me on /ignore lol
[19:47:56] <bomb> as if average Dimitry in Russia has a saying about Putin's foreign policy
[19:48:26] <Miles8of9> russian people don't care about war... they think what kremlin thinks
[19:48:30] <lz_> that or he's using irc in write only mode
[19:48:51] <sysRPL> bomb: the protests can grow in russia as the sanctions begin to make life miserable for the everyday person in russia
[19:49:25] <sysRPL> and the everyday russian will grow to understand that this war is costing them so much
[19:49:39] <lz_> sysRPL: hence the nuke problem
[19:49:41] <Miles8of9> sactions will make no difference.... russia can self-produce EVERYTHING... + they can buy from china

[19:50:15] <lz_> sysRPL: I'm afraid he could, yes
[19:50:28] <bomb> western governments is spreading this Pollyanna optimism like Ukraine is winning the war, so they don't have to send troops or even aid
[19:50:45] <Miles8of9> JakeSays, just be patient and wait a couple of months
[19:50:54] <lz_> bomb: western govs are mostly concerned about not starting WW3, but it might start anyway
[19:51:09] <JakeSays> bomb: "or even aid"? aid has been flowing like water
[19:51:09] <sysRPL> sure he could, but at some point the people on the other side (most of the rest of the world) has to stand up against autocratic dictators
[19:51:19] <bomb> JakeSays yeah where are the jets?

[19:51:56] <bomb> lol
[19:51:59] <lz_> sysRPL: I don't think there's a solution in either case. I'm not even sure the west would retaliate to nukes
[19:52:06] <lz_> nor that it should
[19:52:10] <JakeSays> if they were putin would have won the air war.
[19:52:18] <JakeSays> he hasn't come close
[19:52:31] <Miles8of9> russians never had non-autocratic government...! they don't even know what democracy is... freedom of thought etc etc
[19:52:52] <Miles8of9> neither chinese...
[19:52:54] <sysRPL> lz_: if nukes were used outide of ukraine (on poland or finland for example) the rest of the world would wipe out russia, no question
[19:53:08] <sysRPL> and putin and his generals know that
[19:53:11] <bomb> lz_ I hope this whole shit ends without igniting a global warfare
[19:53:12] <lz_> sysRPL: what would be the point of destroying the world though?
[19:53:39] <Miles8of9> none can wipe russia without beign wiped too
[19:53:45] <bomb> Zelensky already agreed not to join NATO. I feel a neutral Kyiv state would work
[19:54:01] <blez> now nato wants balkan countries to give their soviet anti air stuff to ukraine

[19:54:10] <lz_> I mentioned this the other day, but I don't really believe in MAD, as it's not a symetrical thing
[19:54:48] <Miles8of9> putin doesn't care about neutrality... he WANTS Ukraine as loyal Russian servant...!
[19:55:18] <JakeSays> Miles8of9: i agree with that

[20:12:59] <cloudbender> I had hoped to write a data server

[20:13:25] <JakeSays> what is stackless python
[20:13:37] <cloudbender> Python which has no call stack
[20:13:41] <lz_> I discovered Node.JS and went another way that involved not doing Node.JS

[20:15:38] <bomb> sysRPL did you check Plasticity btw?
[20:15:40] <cloudbender> stable references
[20:15:52] <cloudbender> for instance ...
[20:15:57] <sysRPL> designed to allow people to connect electronics, sensors, and devices together to perform tasks
[20:16:00] <JakeSays> what's a stable reference
[20:16:13] <sysRPL> bomb: yeah. it seems likes it too early to be useful
[20:16:20] <cloudbender> In FreePascal, 'this' inside of a method has a different reference pointer than it's owning object
[20:16:35] <Tobbi_> Stable *s = new Stable(); &s <- Stable reference.
[20:16:37] <sysRPL> this si Self in free pascal
[20:16:49] <bomb> sysRPL yeah. but it's gonna be the closest thing to MoI/Rhino
[20:16:52] <cloudbender> right, but you catch my meaning
[20:17:08] <JakeSays> that's a handle
[20:17:23] <sysRPL> bomb: i am sticking with freecad for now. i have moved onto making assemblies
[20:17:40] <cloudbender> assembling makies ?
[20:17:48] <sysRPL> assemblies = mutliple designed parts connected together with specific contraints
[20:18:11] <bomb> sysRPL right. you have real parametric CAD/CAM usecase. MoI/Rhino is mostly for freeform surface modeling for product design.

[20:21:12] <bomb> sysRPL what's your opinion on kicad for circuit design?
[20:22:51] <JakeSays> cloudbender: the answer is no, but you can do var value in map.Values, or for (var (k,v) in map)..
[20:23:12] <JakeSays> or var (_,v) in map
[20:23:16] <cloudbender> nice
[20:23:44] <cloudbender> JakeSays that's two I owe you

[20:24:48] <sysRPL> star wars is such a racist film series
[20:24:57] <canton7> cloudbender, if you're not actually looking up things by key, don't use a dictionary. If you just want a way of associating keys with values, use e.g. a `List<(string key, string value)>`
[20:26:13] <lz_> I read "if you're actually looking up things by key" and started wondering what was wrong with dictionaries :D
[20:26:26] <sysRPL> star wars a new hope has this white boy, cracker luke skywalker, nazi poster child

[20:28:22] <sysRPL> he gets together a whole clan of white folks, so that the light people can drive out all the dark folks

[20:28:59] <lz_> sysRPL: except I don't remember the color of the skin was ever a reason for anything so it doesn't look very relevant

[20:34:15] <sysRPL> bomb: for that i use easyeda
[20:34:33] <sysRPL> easyeda does everything i want easily
[20:35:15] <sysRPL> the wire routing is especially nice once you understand how it works
[20:35:21] <bomb> sysRPL is it expensive?
[20:35:28] <sysRPL> it's free
[20:35:31] <cloudbender> OK we should not allow AI to invent type names, such as
[20:35:33] <cloudbender> ListViewVirtualItemsSelectionRangeChangedEventArgs
[20:35:38] <bomb> free!?
[20:35:50] <bomb> thanks sysRPL
[20:35:53] <sysRPL> https://easyeda.com/
[20:36:12] <bomb> oh it's SaaS
[20:36:29] <sysRPL> yeah well
[20:36:32] <sysRPL> it works great
[20:36:52] <sysRPL> plus it stores you files online so you can access and share them anywhere
[20:36:55] <bomb> $9.9/Month/Member for the Enterprise version
[20:36:58] <bomb> not bad at all
[20:37:04] <sysRPL> the free version has everything you need
[20:37:20] <sysRPL> the cad tools for psb design are awesome imo

[20:37:33] <JakeSays> cloudbender: lol what ai?
[20:37:39] <sysRPL> i was going to do some tutorial videos with tips and tricks of their designer

[20:37:55] <bomb> JakeSays easyeda
[20:38:01] <JakeSays> ah
[20:38:11] <bomb> good kicad alternative, looks like
[20:38:12] <sysRPL> but seriously, try it out. the way the wires are designed in easy eda is ingenious
[20:38:22] <bomb> alright. thank you!

[20:39:03] <bomb> JakeSays nothing yet. but I might try doing some guitar pedal in the future
[20:39:04] <cloudbender> I was thinking MS has a 'Type Delcaration Bot' that concatinates the necessary words to create distinct types
[20:39:11] <Tripknotix> cloudbender,  interesting, any chance you got a linq for doing that to awhole hashset and or stringarray? =D
[20:39:16] <cloudbender> er, 'Definition Bot'
[20:39:17] <Tripknotix> nevermind ill good it =)
[20:39:20] <bomb> JakeSays https://easyeda.com/

[20:40:18] <cloudbender> Tripknotix I think I may have something
[20:40:31] <Tripknotix> im using jungleHashSet = new HashSet<string>(theWholeFileAsOneLongString.Split('\n')); , shouldnt that have gotten rid of anything?
[20:40:40] <JakeSays> Tripknotix: you should clean the data before it goes in to the container
[20:40:52] <Tripknotix> if i grab a value at say count 5, and then do a compare, it works, but only if i grab a value from the hashset
[20:41:06] <Tripknotix> it comes from a google sheet
[20:41:18] <Tripknotix> exported to csv, single column
[20:41:45] <JakeSays> not sure that changes anything
[20:41:46] <Tripknotix> i would lov ea white list, of just numbers, letters and dashes. if thats the issue
[20:41:49] <Tripknotix> ah ok
[20:41:52] <Tripknotix> damn u google !
[20:41:54] <Tripknotix> =D
[20:41:58] <cloudbender> be sure to .Trim each line from the csv
[20:42:06] <sysRPL> bomb: you ought to try using a raspberry pi and experiment with digital signals
[20:42:13] <Tripknotix> what do you mean, is the split not doing that?
[20:42:19] <sysRPL> uart / i2c/ spi /adc
[20:42:19] <cloudbender> No
[20:42:31] <cloudbender> Split creates a word from the CR/LF
[20:42:49] <sysRPL> and then making your own circuits
[20:42:49] <Tripknotix> so you want me to just trim a specific count correct?
[20:43:13] <sysRPL> you can use c# to do that
[20:43:16] <cloudbender> You are reading lines, ReadLine.Trim()
[20:43:33] <irwiss> Tripknotix: may be check if still have \r left

[20:44:27] <Tripknotix> i was just about to use a similiar regex
[20:44:33] <sysRPL> and learn math
[20:44:44] <sysRPL> it's all about fft
[20:44:47] <Tripknotix> hmm ill test trim real quick, then might use regex
[20:45:03] <Tripknotix> ill need to iterate over thewhole thing, likely ill just save the result as readonly
[20:45:17] <bomb> sysRPL that sounds like a lot of investment
[20:45:27] <cloudbender> return (wword.ToUpper().All(c => "0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ".Contains(c)));
[20:45:37] <cloudbender> cheesy, but it works
[20:45:46] <JakeSays> that's nasty
[20:45:59] <cloudbender> but only for the Western Alphabet
[20:46:04] <Tripknotix> fuckin it was trim
[20:46:26] <Tripknotix> so either at the start of end, its got dirt
[20:46:46] <cloudbender> There will be no extra chars at the line-start
[20:47:12] <cloudbender> some splitters treat cr/lf as values, some do not
[20:47:25] <cloudbender> string.split does
[20:48:08] <Tripknotix> ic ic, i verified, its the hashset that needs the trim, i mean i knew that, but just in case =)
[20:48:27] <Tripknotix> wheres a hashset.trim extension when u need one =D
[20:48:50] <JakeSays> Tripknotix: it's not the responsibility of the container to clean its input
[20:48:58] <Tripknotix> oh hm that would do something different if it was named that

[20:58:22] <JakeSays> cloudbender: it's just nasty
[20:58:31] <Diablo-D3> irwiss: loos like it removes ascii 9, 10, and 13
[20:58:45] <JakeSays> it doesn't remove anything

[20:59:11] <Diablo-D3> wait, wtf does that do? thats wrong

[20:59:55] <JakeSays> irwiss: yeah
[21:00:00] <Diablo-D3> did c# invent some foreign lambda syntax that makes no sense?
[21:00:03] <Diablo-D3> or am I just having a stroke?
[21:00:18] <lz_> let's go back to politcs then
[21:00:23] <Suchiman> he's missing a parenthesis at the end
[21:00:27] * Suchiman slaps lz_ around a bit with a large saber-toothed blenny

[21:00:49] <Suchiman> now it makes more sense
[21:00:50] <Diablo-D3> also, shouldnt it just be actual literals for \t \n and \r? and those are decimal
[21:00:55] <Diablo-D3> he wants the hex values
[21:00:56] <irwiss> parenthesis isn't the prolem here though...
[21:01:04] <JakeSays> Diablo-D3: yes it should
[21:01:27] <lz_> ooohh adding chars make a string? ok :D
[21:01:28] <Diablo-D3> er wait no, those are the decimal values
[21:01:47] <Diablo-D3> also jesus christ that entire line is still garbage
[21:02:04] <lz_> Diablo-D3: isn't it a beautiful thing, it made everyone here agree on something
[21:02:04] <Diablo-D3> you cant make a string in c# by adding chars.
[21:02:17] <Suchiman> cloudbender: here, much cleaner return !word.All(c => c is '\t' or '\r' or '\n');
[21:02:29] <Diablo-D3> lz_: dude
[21:02:33] <Diablo-D3> Ive been coding rust for like 6 months
[21:02:38] <Diablo-D3> I literally had to page c# back into my brain
[21:02:47] <JakeSays> Suchiman: should be word.Any
[21:02:52] <Suchiman> JakeSays: yeah
[21:02:59] <irwiss> i mean, that just checks that all chars in the word are ascii space, and then tries to check if a bool contains something, even if you disregard parenthesis
[21:03:16] <Diablo-D3> btw doesnt String in c# already have a thing for this?
[21:03:28] <cloudbender> Suchiman yes that's a nice one
[21:03:28] <Diablo-D3> because if it doesnt, it probably should given what we just witnessed
[21:03:29] <JakeSays> Char does
[21:03:35] <JakeSays> Char.IsWhitespace or something
[21:04:00] <Suchiman> although that is also true for ' '
[21:04:05] <Suchiman> and that would be undesired i think :P
[21:04:08] <Diablo-D3> yeah, you'd want space
[21:04:09] <JakeSays> Suchiman: ah true
[21:04:10] <cloudbender> I have sets of chars predefined like 'junk'
[21:04:14] <lz_> I think there's a char.IsWhiteSpace()
[21:04:27] <cloudbender> string junk = ""+(char)09+(char)10+(char)13;

[21:05:12] <Suchiman> cloudbender: why not just string junk = "\t\r\n";
[21:05:54] <cloudbender> becuase I am processing old reports that have many more junk characters embedded
[21:06:06] <JakeSays> so?
[21:06:09] <cloudbender> So I'm sticking to one pattern
[21:06:37] <JakeSays> then just write an actual parser

[21:08:02] <JakeSays> like there aren't enough of those already
[21:08:31] <cloudbender> I would use the parser from MS but I'm leary of the 'Unsafe Pointers' aspect
[21:08:40] <Suchiman> cloudbender: by his holy noodleness, just use Newtonsoft :P
[21:08:53] <JakeSays> cloudbender: lol huh?
[21:09:16] <cloudbender> I am also leary of shipping a third-party add-in to the client
[21:09:27] <JakeSays> trust me, your client won't mind
[21:09:34] <cloudbender> lol
[21:09:42] <cloudbender> No.
[21:10:03] <JakeSays> "hey client, do you want me to write a hacked up parser, or use one that has been battle tested and under constant support?"
[21:10:34] <Suchiman> cloudbender: better use C then without stdlib
[21:10:41] <JakeSays> Suchiman: LOL
[21:10:42] <cloudbender> OK I'll look at newton soft
[21:12:00] <JakeSays> cloudbender: or get over your fear of unsafe pointers
[21:12:27] <Suchiman> it's not really "unsafe" pointers :P MS wouldn't release something "unsafe"  xD
[21:12:43] <JakeSays> lol

[22:41:49] <irwiss> doesn't look like it spilled too much, though cleaning it would be stupid hard... if just lighting on fire and running away isn't allowed XD
[22:43:33] <xb0o2> Don't they just dump a load of shit on it and sweep it up?
[22:43:35] <xb0o2> Like sawdust
[22:43:52] <irwiss> yeah, or tons of sand
[22:44:19] <irwiss> but it'll probably spread across like a km if the street has any kind of inclination which looks like it has
[22:45:34] <Nasp> Who mentioned node-icp yesterday?
[22:45:41] <xb0o2> A bunch of people
[22:45:42] <xb0o2> Why?
[22:45:48] <Nasp> I only first saw the news today
[22:45:58] <Nasp> Oh well, node be node
[22:46:10] <xb0o2> blez, bomb and I were discussing it for a while
[22:46:25] <xb0o2> I think irwiss brought it up originally
[22:46:29] <bomb> JakeSays few pro-Russian feeds, in case you want to have a look, all NSFW https://t.me/grey_zone https://t.me/anna_news https://t.me/vysokygovorit
[22:46:36] <JakeSays> holy fuck the skies are hot over kiev
[22:46:54] <irwiss> yeah i mentioned it yesterday first i think, but apparently the shitshow has been going for a few days
[22:47:10] <Nasp> Got an email that they would restart the internal security systems at work
[22:47:14] <irwiss> i swallowed a menthol candy i was supposed to suck on, ffs
[22:47:19] <Nasp> So no doors or elevators would work in 10 minutes
[22:48:05] <blez> JakeSays btw, some things look looped in this video
[22:48:07] <irwiss> elevators only powered on by some security system? sounds like asshole design
[22:48:36] <JakeSays> blez: i've been watching for that but haven't noticed
[22:48:38] <bomb> irwiss BMS
[22:49:08] <blez> JakeSays I might be wrong, but I think I saw the same car 2 or 3 times in the 6th video
[22:49:29] <JakeSays> blez: ah. i'm only watching camera 7
[22:49:55] <JakeSays> cam 6 is in lviv
[22:50:11] <JakeSays> well, i'm watching the kiev cams

[23:24:49] <MatthiasVance> bomb: Ah so more as a "hobby"?
[23:26:30] <MatthiasVance> JakeSays: Where are you watching things?
[23:26:32] <bomb> MatthiasVance EE yeah. I have a few months to decide
[23:29:13] <JakeSays> MatthiasVance: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Val1Evp9HMo - mainly cam 7
[23:30:13] <MatthiasVance> Ah hm what is that annoying bar at the bottom
[23:30:29] <JakeSays> it's usually a news scroller
[23:30:39] <JakeSays> definitely annoying though
[23:30:58] <merced> "russia still in ukraine despite losing"
[23:31:38] <JakeSays> russia doesn't know how to fight a modern war
[23:32:34] <irwiss> nobody really does
[23:33:00] <irwiss> and there were no wars with modern equipment, most combat was only third partying in some local conflict zone
[23:33:20] <merced> idk im pretty sure the US's whole strategy is to fight a modern war against russia
[23:33:23] <JakeSays> i dont get why they started with ground forces.
[23:33:38] <merced> that's what happens when you execute all your generals until you get a yes-man
[23:33:45] <JakeSays> merced: lol true that
[23:33:50] <irwiss> nah, US whole strategy is funnel money via cia to drug cartels and terrorists so they keep the poor regions poor
[23:34:09] <merced> well besides _that_
[23:34:13] <irwiss> then you can go there "to help" and let the arm corps sell off weapons to the army
[23:34:14] <merced> that's more foreign policy, not defense

[23:37:54] <irwiss> lol may be XD
[23:39:29] <bomb> is that funny?
[23:40:20] <irwiss> it's funny cause most of the world ignores that and looks at us as the world police man, because they fear china and russia... when in fact every power pole in the world is "evil" cause it chases it's own interests
[23:40:51] <irwiss> and literally every single one of them shits on whoever gets hurt by those interests
[23:41:27] <bomb> sorry didn't read, what is us?
