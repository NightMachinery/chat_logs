[00:00:23] <rpav> i think california was having a drought when i lived there in the late 80s/early 90s, and i don't think that ever stopped
[00:00:32] <bpalmer> the 2000-2018 data showed its drought has been beat out only by a megadrought in the late 1500s (going over data from the 800s).

[00:46:51] <earthToAdam> So I want to write an appleScript that takes a selection of text from the browser and sends it to org-capture. But... I also want org-capture to open in its own floating window. I've been able to accomplish both of these independently with org-protocol and with emacsclient... but I'm stuck on how to put these together, so that I can create the custom frame AND pre-fill it with content from the browser.

[01:51:13] <acdw> i forget where and what it was, but i heard about it yesterday on NPR, so maybe america?
[01:51:15] * acdw looks it up
[01:51:39] <Sario> Laws are sometimes (but not often) retroactive
[01:51:44] <rpav> if you mean globally, pretty sure _some_ laws have been retroactive
[01:52:01] <acdw> i remember specifically b/c it was retroactive, and i was like, 'I didn't think you could do that"
[01:52:16] <rpav> especially when it's like "hey this is dumb, you (are/were) allowed to do this since <a few months ago>"
[01:52:25] <rpav> or maybe "this applies to last year's taxes" (;
[01:52:40] <bobdobbs> some laws have been retroactive. This is why there are specific laws against bills of attainder in some constituencies.

[01:54:09] <rudybot> https://teensy.info/8AVU63hlYb
[01:54:13] <e1f> i was thinking more of, if X is declared illegal, you can't arrest people who did X before it was declared illegal
[01:54:23] <rpav> acdw: yeah that kind of thing

[01:55:09] <e1f> so in the context of the crypto reporting, it's unlikely that suspicious crypto transactions before the law came into effect could be deemed illegal

[04:18:06] <earthToAdam> http://ix.io/3PDw
[04:18:52] <twb> earthToAdam: at a glance, your problem seems to be that "emacsclient -c" doesn't automatically acquire input focus?
[04:19:01] <earthToAdam> twb it's tricky because the window is being created by emacs. AS is a wrapper for Javascript which grabs the content, then sends it out through org-protocol which builds the floating window...
[04:19:17] <earthToAdam> twb yeah.
[04:19:31] <twb> OK so you can literally reproduce problem with just "emacsclient -c" ?
[04:19:38] <twb> If so that narrows the focus considerably
[04:20:00] <twb> If running "emacsclient -c" by hand focuses correctly, then investigate ways the two usages are different

[04:30:54] <twb> earthToAdam: which means display PDF, which is modern, so apps probably cannot unilaterally focus themselves (like they can in X11)
[04:31:19] <twb> earthToAdam: so you probably need to tell the compositor/window manager to do it, either by policy, or explicitly every time

[08:29:31] <s-liao> Okay. Thanks

[08:30:31] <bpalmer> sure thing

[08:33:34] <twb> https://www.sqlite.org/fasterthanfs.html
[08:33:49] <bpalmer> twb: if you're writing a C file in an editor, you probably want the compiler to be able to access the file eventually.
[08:34:14] <twb> bpalmer: why would the compiler be outside the browser
[08:34:35] <twb> bpalmer: and it sounds like you expect the compiler to be on the phone, instead of on the web server?
[08:34:40] <twb> bpalmer: won't that make the phone rather hot
[08:35:12] <bpalmer> I wasn't thinking of phones at all, actually.
[08:35:26] <twb> bpalmer: well everything else is deprecated, no?
[08:36:01] <bpalmer> the downside of having the compiler in the browser, hmm. There'd be some complicated cross-origin stuff unless you wanted to download the compiler on every project you have, but I suppose that would work.

[15:44:44] <theothornhill> What is the easiest way to check if a file is a subfile/directory of another path?  As in, "is this file somewhere to be found inside this directory"
[15:45:36] <theothornhill> I want to be able to bookmark wildly, then filter bookmarks by the current project using project.el
[15:47:26] <pkal> theothornhill: Recursivly or not?
[15:48:57] <theothornhill> Recursively
[15:49:04] <pkal> I was thinking dealing with this just a few days ago, and it seems that you either have to (file-exists-p (expand-file-name ...)) or use directory-files-recursively with a clever regexp

[15:50:07] <theothornhill> Ah thanks!  It would be nice to be able to maintain a smaller list of bookmarks to serve as a curated "project-buffers"
[15:51:05] <theothornhill> An even more optimal solution would be for it to be branch local as well
[15:51:12] <pkal> With project.el, it might make sense to use project-find-file-in?
[15:51:32] <theothornhill> so that the list of bookmarks is persisted between sessions and branches
[15:51:37] <pkal> Sadly I have never gotten around to using bookmarks, so I don't realy know how they work.

[18:52:54] <Shortstop> Hey there, I have a question regarding refreshing a package's contents from MELPA. The package is 'emacs-slack' from 'https://melpa.org/#/slack. My problem is that even after deleting the 'slack-20210712.628' directory from ~/.emacs.d/elpa, I am still seeing the older 'slack-20210712.628' version appear there.
[18:52:54] <Shortstop> My goal is to get the '20211129.310' version since this contains a crucial update for XOXC based tokens from Slack

[19:37:06] <rpav> what's not fast
[19:37:18] <Unicorn_Princess> eeeeh, just generally could be snappier
[19:37:24] <jbe> basically everything that needs it is probably already bytecompiled I'm guessing
[19:37:27] <grym> ,native-comp
[19:37:30] <rpav> there's native comp stuff now but

[19:38:43] <Unicorn_Princess> that could be it
[19:38:56] <rpav> my solution is "don't use it"
[19:39:09] <Unicorn_Princess> scrolling through a c++ source, for which i have lsp, is a bit choppy, while scrolling through lsp-less .spacemacs.el is snappy
[19:39:10] <rpav> also maybe turning down the file watch stuff in LSP (i have it off completely)
[19:39:18] <rpav> yeah probably lsp-ui thne
[19:39:37] <Unicorn_Princess> i'd rather live with the slight choppyness than go without lsp
[19:39:43] <rpav> emacs 28 also helped with the lsp stuff because of the faster json parser and other general performance improvements iirc

[22:28:30] <ldb> but yeah if you want to get serious, some other projects has more strict requirement on that
[22:28:51] <artefact> yes you definitely want git format-patch
[22:28:58] <technomancy> git format-patch gives you an actual patch file if you don't want to send email directly from git
[22:29:05] <artefact> and maybe even git send-email
[22:29:32] <technomancy> send-email is technically better in some ways but I totally understand not wanting to use it because there's definitely things about it that suck
[22:29:34] *** Joins: Catie (~user@user/catie)
[22:29:41] <ldb> send-email requires sendmail properly setup, I think it isn't true for most people
[22:29:58] <artefact> you don't have to aiui, the manpage explains simple smtp passthrough
[22:30:05] <technomancy> also it assumes you're OK with sending email without your MUA, which is dumb
[22:30:45] <ldb> but once you've get into it, sending email is lots of fun
[22:31:07] <artefact> you can tell the tool was made by kernel devs, for kernel devs
[22:31:09] <technomancy> if you want to ad a follow-up in the same thread as the original, good luck
[22:31:27] <technomancy> if you have multiple patches, it separates them into multiple emails, which is wacky
[22:31:35] <bremner> it is?

[22:31:44] <artefact> it's for sending your patches to mailing lists. if you have follow ups reply to the thread normally, or send a PATCH v2
[22:32:03] <technomancy> artefact: "normally" meaning using your MUA?
[22:32:13] <artefact> one patch per e-mail makes code review easier on a mailing list thread
[22:32:31] <bremner> technomancy: sure. Press c G. then paste the arguments into the command line
[22:32:39] <bremner> I can't help if that only works in notmuch :P
[22:32:45] <ldb> https://notmuchmail.org/contributing/ notmuch uses the "serious" work flow
[22:33:02] <bremner> ldb: it has pros and cons.
[22:33:19] <bremner> it means we don't kneel to big-forge

[22:36:27] <artefact> never mind explaining "what's that weird signature.asc file you attach to all your messages"
[22:37:16] <bremner> technomancy: I don't find IRC suitable for patch review
[22:37:50] <bremner> it's a bit like writing elisp in emacs; notmuch is good at reviewing patches to notmuch.
[22:37:55] <technomancy> granted I'm very rarely dealing with patches of over 2 or 3 pages in length
[22:38:03] <Shortstop> neat, you can submit patches via IRC?
[22:38:24] <bremner> if you share urls
[22:38:40] <technomancy> Shortstop: sure, just be like "hey I pushed a branch called foobar to my remote at https://my.git.host/technomancy/jankytown WDYT"
[22:38:47] <ldb> you can xdcc to share files over IRC

[22:55:53] <technomancy> bremner: I guess my question is what's the downside of pasting into mu4e
[22:56:10] <bremner> why not attach patch?
[22:56:38] <technomancy> doesn't putting it inline make it easier to comment on?
[22:56:53] <bremner> depends on the reading MUA.
[22:57:09] <technomancy> hm
[22:57:21] <bremner> technomancy: I guess my real objection is that I can't cleanly turn the email into a commit
[22:57:44] <technomancy> oh, why's that?
[22:58:22] <bremner> commit message, mostly
[22:58:53] <bremner> I get all the "Hi my name is techno and this is my patch" faff in front
[22:59:06] <technomancy> oh, it needs commit msg as the subject; right
