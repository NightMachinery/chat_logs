[00:48:06] <theprophet> So, i reached the deployment state in my django learnings. and i beg you answer me. on couple of questions
[00:48:20] <theprophet> is requirments.txt neccessary or optional?
[00:49:11] <theprophet> i know what it contains, but should it include everything, or there are neccessary things you need to include there and rest is optional? i mean whats neccessary and whats optional there?
[00:50:50] <jim> well as far as I know, requirements.txt specifies the dependencies, that is, the things that need to be installed for things to work properly (or at all)
[00:51:43] <theprophet> so without it , the app wont work when deployed for example on free server host?
[00:52:41] <jim> I'm not sure... on the tutorials I've seen, the first step is to install django itself (and python3 if it's not already installed)
[00:53:03] *** Joins: arend (~arend@84-31-198-78.cable.dynamic.v4.ziggo.nl)
[00:53:09] <theprophet> ok then, lets wait for somebody who knows , thank you tho.
[00:53:47] <jim> things other than that may need to be installed, again, to make things work properly
[00:53:51] *** Joins: soul-d (~uknown@user/soul-d)
[00:54:03] <jim> yep, good thought
[00:54:38] <jim> there's a harvard course you can audit free online
[00:54:41] <colo> it will depend on what kind of system or platform you are going you deploy to. but yes, you will need to have your actual depencies accounted for and in order eventually.
[00:55:32] <theprophet> so it is necessary colo .  Must have file.
[00:56:23] <theprophet> colo does that system , platform, aquire those dependecies automaticly or i need to do it manually?
[00:56:34] <colo> there are going to be environment where you do not need it to get your django application to start and run. but I would imagine those to be the exception. did you develop your application using requirements.txt to install depdencies?
[00:56:41] <jim> theprophet, it's one way to do it, maybe it's the "usual" or "standard" way
[00:57:13] <colo> you will have to check with the platform of your choice. that's the least thing they should be documenting if they advertise python hosting
[00:57:30] <theprophet> colo i havent done it yet, but i dont understand whats what here , whats needed and whats not

[01:00:00] <colo> theprophet, reqirements.txt document which software components your project needs to run. chances are no runtime environment in the world will bring exactly the combination of dependencies YOUR specific application is going to need, so you will need to declare and install them. assume you will need requirements.txt - I would wager most modern platforms expect it to be there.
[01:00:24] <jim> theprophet, it's -very- important that -something- knows what is needed to run your web program. if that's not you, maybe it should be in something like a requirements.txt

[01:02:03] <jim> theprophet, this is your app? you're the author?
[01:02:27] <theprophet> colo so if i dont include requirments.txt i can still do fine? what if i remember all dependecies, can i go like this? i am asking this because, i want to fully understand , if requirments.txt is like deadly required or not
[01:03:09] <colo> I basically already answered that question. yes, it is POSSIBLE that it could work like this. it is, however, very much unlikely it will.

[01:03:36] <theprophet> i see, some platforms do some dont

[01:05:01] <colo> sure, just ask :)
[01:05:18] <jim> ok, so if you know what it needs, you could put that information into a requirements.txt, I'm given to understand that something can read that file to install everything on the list, so it -is- one way you can go about it
[01:05:55] <theprophet> colo so i watching, the video tutorial, where guy includes gunicorn in his requirments.txt but he never installed it , it was just a name in the list. what did he probabaly meant by doing it?

[01:07:21] <theprophet> i was watching* - probably *
[01:07:28] <colo> theprophet, gunicorn is software that sually sits between your python application and some terminating web server/reverse proxy (you might have heard of nginx and the like)
[01:07:43] <colo> if you only ever ran django in development mode, you wouldn't have seen it
[01:08:06] <colo> but you might want (have?) to use it once you run your application in production mode
[01:08:23] *** Quits: Thanatos (~Thanatos@105.112.184.235) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[01:08:34] <theprophet> so it is ok, to include something that is not installed in your django app?
[01:08:41] <theprophet> in your requirments.txt?
[01:09:19] <colo> also, stuff in reqirements.txt usually gets installed in one single go, so you might have missed that video author installing it, but not ending up using it
[01:09:38] <theprophet> ooh , i see
[01:10:04] <colo> having something needed, but not installed, is worse than having something installed, but not ending up needing it ;)
[01:10:15] <colo> (well, usually.)
[01:10:16] <theprophet> so if add something not installed, it just a name? or it will be also portrayed as dependecie?
[01:10:41] <theprophet> when deployed on certain platform
[01:11:00] <colo> if you add lines to your requirements.txt but don't do anything else, it wont change the state of yor project beyond that new line.
[01:11:32] <theprophet> after deploy right?
[01:11:42] <theprophet> it has to be installed right?
[01:11:44] <colo> but once you re-run pip (or maybe some other mechanism) to make sure all your depencies are there, changes will be made
[01:12:05] <colo> you will have to ensure required depencies are there for python to be found, yes
[01:12:18] <theprophet> ahh, i see it might install that line which is not in my project
[01:12:29] <colo> chances are your hosting platform will do that for you, by interpreting requirements.txt upon deploying
[01:12:43] <theprophet> i see
[01:13:05] <colo> other hosting platforms will expect you to submit a container image or tar/zip archive with all the dedencies already installed by you
[01:13:14] <colo> but also then, sing requirements.txt makes sense
[01:13:27] <colo> because it makes your work reproducible
[01:13:44] <theprophet> yes , that part i know. i watched one guy making archieve of entire project, removing couple of things
[01:14:56] <theprophet> colo thank you my friend. , thank you for your time and energy. i apreciate what you've done for me.
[01:15:23] <colo> you're welcome. good luck on your journey and with your project! :)

[16:17:38] <GinFuyou> nikitagupta, it's not really a django problem, in this setup it's purely apache job
[16:18:18] <GinFuyou> also, we don't recommend apache with mod_wsgi. If you prefer apache, still recommended to use gunicorn \ uwsgi behind it
[16:19:02] <nikitagupta> actually in our system, we have one more application which is using python, apache, java, angular...and there they have taken the application by configuring ssl certs into java settings.json file. And they expect the same for Django application as well.
[16:19:29] <nikitagupta> My employer wants to configure the ssl certs into django application and take the application to https.
[16:20:52] <nikitagupta> is this a possibility even? Because from all my search I can see people are configuring apache's httpd.conf file for configuring mod_wsgi and mod_ssl. And m not finding any solution for configuring it into django itself instead of apcahe
[16:21:06] <GinFuyou> well, it's probably possible but I'm not sure anybody is doing it, so helping here could be problematic
[16:21:45] <GinFuyou> though, mod_wsgi...
[16:21:54] <GinFuyou> no idea, really.

[18:08:24] <theprophet> So i am watching this guy on youtube, which teaches us how to deploy django app,on digital ocean and i am seeing that he has gunicorn installed in his tutorial django app, but when i searched, digital ocean does not has customizable WSGI , and uses only NGNIX as webserver . and my question is why is this guy has installed gunicorn when it wont work
[18:08:25] <theprophet> on digital ocean ?
[18:09:38] <theprophet> i know that he does gunicorn, because it is included in requirments.txt  , so if having gunicorn in your django project, what is the point in this case of having it?
[18:10:09] <theprophet> so if having gunicorn in your django project wont work on digital ocean*
[18:13:27] <theprophet> ngnix for webserving*
[18:13:28] <GinFuyou> theprophet, why it won't work? Are you looking at shared hosting plan instead of a VPS?
[18:13:57] <theprophet> i dont know, thats why i am asking
[18:14:16] <theprophet> clearly  i am not seeing something
[18:14:21] <theprophet> and i was curious
[18:14:48] <GinFuyou> Well, then I can only say that your statement is incorrect
[18:15:03] <theprophet> ok

[23:54:43] <jim> jaybe, https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:HarvardX+CS50W+Web/home
[23:55:08] <jim> and yes, it's free/gratis, if you don't want a certificate
[23:56:17] <jim> otherwise it's about $200
[23:58:13] <nedbat> jim: people seem to love CS50 (full disclosure: i work at edx, but have nothing to do with the course :)  )
