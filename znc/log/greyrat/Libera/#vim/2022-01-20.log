[01:17:48] <nickspoon> gaze___: OK I think you're trying to build up a big register (a) full of the words you cut, and then paste them all at the end, separated by newlines. It might be simpler to do this as you go, rather than all at once
[01:18:26] <nickspoon> You could do that by cutting the words you want, with vwwd or d2w or whatever, then  :$put

[01:19:01] <nickspoon> It writes the content of a register on a new line in the file
[01:19:24] <nickspoon> So if you use the range $ it writes the content of the register on a new line at the end of the file
[01:19:33] <gaze___> ah that's neat@

[01:20:45] <nickspoon> It moves the cursor to the bottom though, so you might just want to drop a mark first, e.g.  m'  so you can get back to the same cursor location afterwards with  ``

[06:11:45] <KimK> Hi, in reading this Vim search tutorial (  https://www.linux.com/training-tutorials/vim-tips-basics-search-and-replace/  ), I am very confused by this: "As an example, the * quantifier tells Vim to match 0 or more of a character. So, a search like /abc* will match abc, abby, and absolutely." 
[06:11:47] <KimK> I understand why abc would match, or abcd, or abcxyz. But why would abby or absolutely match? Does just mentioning * in the search string mean that all parameters in the string are zero or more? I'm confused. 
[06:13:02] <phy1729> It just matches in ab in abby
[06:13:05] *** Joins: digup (~digup@149.167.138.23)
[06:14:33] <KimK> But the search was for abc, doesn't abb cause a reject before we get to the final * ?
[06:15:44] <phy1729> The regex didn't specify a whole word has to be matched
[06:16:28] <phy1729> so the ab in   baby   would match too
[06:18:37] <KimK> Is this some kind of Vim super-search mode, or is this the normal mode of operation? Sorry if this is "obvious", but I don't get it. What would happen if you searched for /abc , same thing or different?
[06:19:28] <phy1729> That's just how regexes work. While vim and grep have different syntaxes,   grep ab /usr/share/dict/words    matches quite a lot

[21:27:27] <fsoc> Forgot about the first link to a website. Let's just consider the book (https://net0.cx51.xyz/vim_book.pdf) for now.
[21:27:54] <romainl> so, the book, then what?
[21:28:01] <dayid> fsoc: Try ":help diw"
[21:28:14] <dayid> it explains "delete inner word" and doesn't require any 3rd party analogies.
[21:28:15] <almostdvs> it means what it says fsoc not sure what answer you are looking for
[21:28:43] <stanrifkin> fsoc: get a better book maybe.
[21:28:44] <romainl> well, fsoc didn't ask any question
[21:29:20] <fsoc> dayid: I'm not why it's called "inner".
[21:29:25] <romainl> fsoc: that part of the book is wrong, not sure about the rest but if it's like that part then it's crap
[21:29:53] <dayid> fsoc: is English your native language?
[21:29:58] <fsoc> dayid: No.
[21:30:01] <dayid> is it the use of "inner" that is lost?
[21:30:10] <romainl> fsoc: :h text-objects explains all about text objects
[21:30:10] <digmbot> :help text-objects -> http://vimhelp.appspot.com/motion.txt.html#text-objects
[21:30:11] <stanrifkin> fsoc: your cursor is "in" the word so to say
[21:30:32] <fsoc> No, I know the literal meaning of "inner", but I was asking about the choice of the word "inner".
[21:30:44] <romainl> the choice?
[21:30:55] <romainl> do you think it is inappropriate?
[21:31:23] <phy1729> vim has to hide new features behind keystrokes that were previously errors. i and a were available and I'd assume the mnemonic came after
[21:31:48] <fsoc> lol. i asked if there's a reason they named it that way, so that that'd help me remember/understand better.
[21:31:51] <romainl> it is used for exactly what it is fsoc
[21:31:52] <dayid> fsoc: if your current highlighted "char" in the word "biglongword" is on the "l"; then diw will delete the whole word that you are within. As opposed to doing just "dw" which will delete from the current location to the end of the word...
[21:32:14] <dayid> Some of that understanding may just come from practicing/using the commands
[21:32:18] <romainl> fsoc: nothing is named "inner"

[21:33:12] <fsoc> dayid: makes sense.
[21:33:16] <dayid> romainl: the "inner" here is from me - and me quoting specifically the :help for diw which mentions:         "diw"   delete inner word                       *diw*

[23:49:49] <alyssa> When adding a comment inside a function in C code indented with tabs, then wrapping with (normal mode) `gqj`, vim seems to insert a single space before inserting a hard tab. Any idea why, and how to stop that from happening?
[23:49:55] <alyssa> (The project is the Linux kernel.)
[23:50:07] <alyssa> au BufNewFile,BufRead */linux/* set colorcolumn=81 noexpandtab ci pi tabstop=8 softtabstop=8 shiftwidth=8
[23:50:23] <alyssa> ^ relevant vimrc, this may be wrong, I don't know vim well despite years of using it.
[23:51:20] <alyssa> As a workaround, I can then unindent the wrapped comment (spamming <<) and then reindent it (spamming >>), and then a single hard tab is used without a space at the start. That's annoying, though.
