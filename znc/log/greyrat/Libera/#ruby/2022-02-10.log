[00:53:45] <leah2> hi
[00:54:46] <hellstabber[m]12> Hii
[01:05:05] <libsys> sup brahs... question... can I specify an executable as dependency on a gemspec? I require a program to be installed which is not available on through rubygems 
[01:06:23] <leah2> i dont think so
[01:06:34] <leah2> you could check it on startup

[01:14:07] <leah2> rubygems couldnt install it anyway, so what's the purpose :p

[01:22:48] <nakilon> agree with mooff on numbered parameters
[01:26:25] <nakilon> adam12 not sure what I was smuggling lol but I'm pretty much lost in ruby's OOP and I don't feel a shame
[01:27:53] <nakilon> I suppose the fraction of interviewers who ask you oop quiz questionf from google is 10-100 higher than those who really understand the point of the oop
[01:29:15] <nakilon> so when you add all the ruby abilities around it it's just insane how one can remember all the stuff
[01:30:43] <nakilon> decades ago when you was taught how C with structures were getting the shape of C++ every single feature was explained why it had to be invented, at least I feel that it was like that
[01:31:43] <nakilon> now they just copypaste someone's blog posts into one pdf and call it "a book", that has oop in the 2nd or 3rd chapter just because
[01:32:31] <nakilon> resulting in teaching you overcomplicate things

[02:31:26] <cahoots> hi, if i have a class "class MyClass ; def func1 ; at_exit { func2 } ; end ; def func2 ; end ; end" and i run "obj = MyClass.new ; obj.func1 ; obj = nil ; exit 0", will i run into issues since obj is deallocated?
[02:35:51] <leftylink> I don't see how it could. you can't know that obj is deallocated. I expect it not to be, because whatever is keeping track of at_exit functions would have necessarily need to have kept a reference to obj
[02:38:38] <cahoots> leftylink, how does the block keep a reference to obj?
[02:38:56] <cahoots> would it not keep a reference if the block didn't call func2?
[02:39:49] <ox1eef> i dont think the GC is not going to let you shoot yourself in the foot like that, at worst it would be nil
[02:40:16] <ox1eef> -not
[02:43:12] <weaksauce> i would assume the at_exit keeps a closure 
[02:43:31] <weaksauce> and then it would run fine
[02:43:51] <weaksauce> and since there is a closure there the GC wouldn't cull it 
[02:45:35] <cahoots> so ruby parses the closure, finds all the callers of functions, and retains them? how does it even know what to retain without running the closure?
[02:46:43] <ox1eef> ruby knows everything about your program, it can easily make informed decisions about when to GC or not
[02:47:00] <cahoots> ruby is also highly dynamic
[02:47:33] <ox1eef> it's also not C. you're not going to cause a segfault this way and if you did it would be a bug.
[02:47:40] <weaksauce> > Converts block to a Proc object (and therefore binds it at the point of call) and registers it for execution when the program exits. If multiple handlers are registered, they are executed in reverse order of registration.

[02:48:20] <weaksauce> everything is in scope in that object so func2 would be valid
[02:50:47] <weaksauce> you could see by playing around with ObjectSpace::garbage_collect before exiting i guess

[03:19:18] <nakilon> I wish I could add 'when' blocks in a loop
[03:42:31] <mooff> obj = nil doesn't deallocate the object, it just sets the obj variable to nil
[03:44:56] *** Joins: cahoots (~cahoots@190.0.32.130)
[03:45:04] <weaksauce> yeah that's why, since there is a reference to the scope in there containing the object the mark and sweep algorithm will not cull it... it's also something that you can get into with two strongly held loops of references that can cause a memory leak... not sure if ruby has that problem but it's definitely a problem in other reference counting GCs
[03:51:20] <mooff> i wonder if locals are necessarily referenced when a block is created in the scope of them

[18:40:36] <leah2> just use regular if :p

[18:58:38] <mooff> to save someone else a Google: i think the intent there is a ? b : true :)
[18:59:13] <leah2> hm, another way to put it
[18:59:39] * mooff thanks that one StackOverflow explainer
[19:01:19] <leftylink> hmm it's too bad, becase in school I would have lost marks if I'd written boolean expressions involving true or false like that
[19:01:27] <leftylink> but that actually looks all right
[19:01:32] <leftylink> so I wish I would not have had to lose marks for that
[19:04:13] <mooff> when sounds pretty useful in for
[19:05:26] <leah2> i also want while else :p but not like python
[19:05:59] <mooff> have wanted rescue without begin in if/for/all kinds of blocks
[19:06:06] <leah2> yeah maybe
[19:06:20] <mooff> i think while else may be supported in Ruby
[19:06:25] <leah2> it isnt
[19:07:04] <mooff> cool
[19:07:18] <leah2> i also want a more granular rescue...
[19:07:27] <leah2> you should say which parts you want to catch
[19:07:42] <leah2> dunno any language that can do this properly
[19:07:47] <mooff> what like?
[19:08:00] <leah2> e.g. begin a; b; c; catch FooError => ... end
[19:08:13] <leah2> but you only want to catch FooError if b threw it
[19:08:27] <leah2> (and catch other stuff from other calls or so)
[19:09:04] <mooff> how would you say you only want to catch FooError's from b?
[19:09:13] <leah2> well idk! :D
[19:09:20] <mooff> xD
[19:09:26] <leah2> but i think many file not found exceptions or so are too wide
[19:09:28] <leah2> or argumenterror
[19:09:33] <leah2> lots of things can throw that
[19:09:37] <mooff> idk either but i'd like to be able to inline rescue only certain types of errors
[19:10:43] <leah2> yeah

[19:10:58] <leah2> hard to parse i guess
[19:10:59] <mooff> probably wouldn't fit with the existing syntax
[19:11:03] <leah2> File.open rescue Foo => ...
[19:11:18] <mooff> yeah, it's hard to think what could be consistent
[19:11:24] <mooff> and backwards compatible
[19:11:46] <leah2> hm, its not a hash literal tho
[19:11:50] <leah2> so could work
[19:12:02] <leah2> ah it's this damn pattern matching now :<
[19:12:04] <mooff> {File.open rescue Foo => a}
[19:12:07] <mooff> does that work atm? :P
