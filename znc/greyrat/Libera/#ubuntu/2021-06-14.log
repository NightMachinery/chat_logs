[00:34:25] <tgp1994> Hi everyone, I'm trying to configure DNS resolution on Ubuntu Server 20.04 and I'm hoping I can ask for some help. I'm running AdGuard Home in a container on this system, that I'd like to be the main resolver. I've verified that AGH is configured and resolving on its own. I've also mapped the ports

But any other application on the system - such as nslookup - cannot resolve names. nslookup reports that it's getting a response from an unexpected source (127.0.0.1 instead of .53).

When I entered that mode I was seeing all options clearly, since the installer became textual. No need for server installation and mini iso and things like that. I could navigate through options, so no need for pressing buttons blindly either. I could see what your suggested procedure
[01:18:49] <Anna_> were trying to do. So I was able to test some things and see if I could simplify your procedure. It seems (a) in order to enter that mode, you can press any button, not just spacebar and (b) you don't have to delete the 3 dashes in the end of the prefixed command after F6. You can simply type the "video=LVDS-1:d" part right after esc from F6 menu. After the live session was loaded, I used the regular terminal [super+T] and "xrandr -s 800x600" and
[01:18:49] <Anna_> the normal, graphical installation was started from live session and done without any problem.

[08:26:37] <JeffATL> i've tried twice now to boot a dell server to a usb drive with ubuntu-20.04.2-live-server-amd64.iso dd'ed to it and it says something like "ISO corrupt." is there a trick to this? command use was dd if=ubuntu-20.04.2-live-server-amd64.iso of=/dev/sdb bs=1M and  shasum checked out.
[08:29:15] <tomreyn> JeffATL: shasum of what and what?

[09:02:19] <Alturic> The reason I even got to this is because I didn't think it would really care about speed, but I wanted to see before I really do a benchmark between the two processors, ha.
[09:02:27] <TJ-> Alturic: presumably both have similar background loads?

[09:02:30] <Alturic> But this is... eye-opening to say the least.
[09:03:17] <Alturic> As funny as it is, the slower speed per core is actually much higher load than the Ubuntu server with no load at all.
[09:04:03] <TJ-> Alturic: try timing both:  " time bash -c 'C=1000000; while [[ $C > 0 ]]; do ((C = C-1)); done' "

[09:07:28] <Alturic> ^ Meant that as your example was those numbers.

[09:23:54] <Alturic> Thanks for the info both of you. One last question. This might be a bit low-level in terms of how processors work, but something that's cpu intensive calculating would it be better to process 2 iterations on 4 actual cores, or 1 iteration on the 4 cores/8 threads?
[09:24:25] <Alturic> I assumed there was a bit of overhead on the threads, and you would be better of using 100% of the core twice, instead of 100% of the "core" and 100% of the thread... once.

[17:27:31] <Guest30> apt-get update in another client machine, but still got the same warning message. How to resign the private repository files with new gpg.conf settings?

[22:00:59] <ox4e44> You should not have any much delay on this.

[23:37:53] <z1haze> Hi folks, when trying to figure out the proper way to set a static IP on my ubuntu server, when googling i have found several difference ways, all involving netplan, but why are everyone's cloud.yml files named differently, if they are all examples on 20.04 ?
[23:39:48] <z1haze> and in some of these files for the dhcp option, they have yes/no and in my file, it says true, so im assuming the opposite would be false, and not 'no' .. why so inconsistent
[23:42:48] <rbasak> z1haze: netplan reads /etc/netplan/*.yaml, so you can call the file whatever you like. This allows tools to drop-in and/or manage different networks as different files without interfering with one another.

[23:44:48] <rbasak> z1haze: yes/no or true/false come down to YAML syntax, where both forms are accepted as boolean types. See: https://yaml.org/type/bool.html
