[03:38:05] <slaughter> Lord almighty if you have any interest in changing jobs right now the market is so hot you might need to bring a fire extenguisher
[03:42:49] <slaughter> My job hunt last year was nowhere near this easy
[03:57:02] <rawtaz> eh
[03:57:03] <rawtaz> heh*
[03:57:26] <rawtaz> perhaps thats true for employments
[03:57:36] <rawtaz> on the consulting side people seem just as picky as always
[03:57:55] <rawtaz> caring more about CVs than how you think and work
[04:11:16] <slaughter> Well yeah consulting is just pure hell
[04:11:25] <Dus10> I love consulting
[04:11:40] <slaughter> I guess somene needs to love it
[04:11:43] <slaughter> But it damn sure ain't me
[04:11:47] <Dus10> if it weren't for consulting I probably wouldn't have a job because I would have burned through all of the local places of employment
[04:12:03] <Dus10> I can only hang out for 2-3 years at a place without losing my mind
[04:12:19] <Dus10> I do all of the things then they don't let me do new things because I did all of the things
[04:12:21] <Dus10> then I am bored
[04:12:27] <slaughter> That's totally fair
[04:12:30] <Dus10> consulting is like always having a new job for me
[04:12:42] <slaughter> But 2-3 years is the Tech Job Hopping Thingâ„¢ so that works out :p
[04:12:53] <Dus10> I have been at my current place for over 8 years now
[04:13:01] <Dus10> I was at my previous place for like 5 years
[04:13:09] <Dus10> before that.... tons of 1-3 years stints
[04:13:27] <rawtaz> as a consultant?
[04:13:46] <Dus10> before the last place, I wasn't a consultant... except for my first job
[04:14:04] <Dus10> I shouldn't have been a consultant then... but it only lasted for a year... they closed our brance
[04:14:08] <Dus10> branch
[04:15:04] <rawtaz> so you are consulting now?
[04:15:26] <Dus10> yeah
[04:15:28] <Dus10> for over 8 years
[04:15:36] <Dus10> and teaching...
[04:15:39] <Dus10> that is just over 2 years now
[04:15:59] <rawtaz> are you employed as a consultant or are you your own company and people hire you as a consultant?
[04:16:04] <Dus10> and... I played the game of two jobs by working remotely
[04:16:12] <slaughter> I can't imagine not being totally burnt out on clients after 8 years
[04:16:12] <Dus10> I am employed as a consultant
[04:16:24] <Dus10> nah, I love it slaughter
[04:16:36] <slaughter> Keep on keepin' on then my dude!
[04:16:38] <Dus10> I mean, I can certainly feel burned out
[04:16:48] <slaughter> Again, someone's gotta do it. Just ain't me
[04:16:53] <Dus10> but it is better than being employed by the customers that I work for
[04:17:02] <rawtaz> noone wants to be slaughtered anyway ;)
[04:17:14] <Dus10> ba dum tsss
[04:17:19] <slaughter> You'd think
[04:17:34] <slaughter> But based on my current calendar and linkedin messages, they totally want to be slaughtered
[04:18:29] <slaughter> I still can't get over it. Last year doing the same job hunt for basically the same jobs...next to nothing, lots of ghosting. A year of experience doesn't hurt obvi but I'm in the second round of interviews at 2 (very promising!) places after 4 days of looking
[04:19:04] <rawtaz> i wish you luck :)
[04:19:11] <Dus10> I have my final interview for a promotion on Monday
[04:19:13] <rawtaz> what jobs are you applying for?
[04:19:21] <Dus10> for absolute undisputed top dog
[04:20:23] <Dus10> I am "Tech Lead" now
[04:20:37] <slaughter> rawtaz basically anything that looks cool and a few that don't. My filter is more or less "small(er) company, no fintech/marketing/healthcare/blockchain, not a consulting org"
[04:20:38] <Dus10> we have two TLs, though... and we are forecasting a need for 4
[04:20:43] <slaughter> Damn Dus10 good luck!
[04:20:55] <slaughter> Do you get the youtube channel when you get the promotion?
[04:21:01] <Dus10> I am interviewing for the sole Technical Architect role
[04:21:12] <Dus10> my boss doesn't want me to because I will be in a different department
[04:21:19] <Dus10> I said to make me the Senior Technical Lead
[04:21:27] <slaughter> Oh you're already tech lead, even better. Hell yeah man much luck!
[04:21:34] <rawtaz> i was asked to apply for a tech lead job a while ago. by the one announcing it. but they only wanted to employ so i didnt even apply.
[04:21:57] <Dus10> I have a Youtube channel, but I haven't posted anything since moving away from O365 work
[04:21:58] <rawtaz> Dus10: lots of roles. what a mess :o
[04:22:23] <Dus10> so... it has been years, at this point

[17:33:02] <nakedeyes> i'm not sure if it is rude to ask or not, ima doin it anyway: whats the avg age here?
[17:33:59] <nakedeyes> slaughter: i'm wishing you luck finding a good job.
[17:37:56] <rawtaz> haha i dont think anyone knows the average age in here :D
[17:38:11] <rawtaz> but given that kwilczynski is around it must be very high
[17:40:14] <kwilczynski> Don't talk about your elders like that!
[17:40:19] <nakedeyes> sure it is not direct enough, if anyone is willing to share please do it. curiosity is my inner-fuel. i'm 29.
[17:40:20] <kwilczynski> :)
[17:40:33] <rawtaz> kwilczynski: sorry! i thought you were old enough to not hear me :P
[17:40:53] <kwilczynski> rawtaz: What??? WHAT???? 
[17:40:56] <kwilczynski> :)
[17:41:03] <rawtaz> nakedeyes: let's conclude that a lot of us are way older :P ( :( )
[17:41:12] <nakedeyes> hahah
[17:41:30] <kwilczynski> nakedeyes: What's he saying... This troublemaker rawtaz.
[17:41:35] <kwilczynski> :)
[17:42:47] <kwilczynski> nakedeyes: Be careful. He's very cheeky this one. Back in my days we would send him off to Australia. But then... they revolted and made it into a country proper, so fat chance now...
[17:42:50] <rawtaz> nakedeyes: as you can tell, some of us are three-digit old ;)
[17:43:00] <kwilczynski> Yes. 0xx
[17:43:00] <kwilczynski> :P
[17:43:05] <nakedeyes> not respecting his elders... :D:DDDD jeeeeeez
[17:43:07] <kwilczynski> Like HTTP codes.
[17:43:30] <kwilczynski> Wait.
[17:43:35] <kwilczynski> How am I actually?
[17:43:41] <kwilczynski> Where's my calculator.
[17:43:50] <kwilczynski> Ahh. Yes.
[17:43:57] <kwilczynski> The ripe age of almost 40.
[17:44:18] <kwilczynski> But, I look like a baby panda, so that's OK.
[17:44:27] <nakedeyes> you must have your beard all over on the ground.
[17:44:30] <kwilczynski> Thanks to my porridge and seaweed diet.
[17:44:44] <kwilczynski> nakedeyes: I would... if I still had any hair left. :)
[17:44:50] <rawtaz> raw seeweed directly from the ocean certainly tastes well doesnt it
[17:45:01] <kwilczynski> rawtaz: You are being picky.
[17:45:02] <rawtaz> it has that fishy sensation to it
[17:45:28] <kwilczynski> The ocean variety is the best one. The best kind.
[17:45:32] <kwilczynski> With micro-plastic.
[17:45:42] <kwilczynski> Tastes like a Tesco bag. Truth be told.
[17:46:15] <kwilczynski> (don't ask me how do I know how does a Tesco bag tastes) 
[17:46:26] <rawtaz> lol
[17:46:30] <nakedeyes> who doesnt know?!
[17:46:34] <kwilczynski> nakedeyes: Anyway. Welcome. Make yourself a home.
[17:46:38] <rawtaz> well presumably you came in one
[17:47:31] <kwilczynski> No. I am always eco-friendly.
[17:47:52] <kwilczynski> I was delivered to the orphanage in a proper bio-bag. Fully recyclable.
[17:48:06] <kwilczynski> Paper.
[17:48:16] <kwilczynski> Will save us all. Or rot, or both.
[17:48:30] <kwilczynski> nakedeyes: I am 38.
[17:48:58] <nakedeyes> i'm following this channel for a while now. nice little comunity, this is here. few people keeping it on an active :d
[17:49:02] <kwilczynski> nakedeyes: Pssyt. There is also our friendly sister channel -> ##sre if you want more random banter.
[17:49:51] <nakedeyes> kwilczynski: yes i thought you are a bit under 40. ^^
[17:49:52] <rawtaz> kwilczynski: you are 38? seriously?
[17:50:02] <kwilczynski> nakedeyes: "few people keeping in on an active" - nice polite euphemism for saying "some people rant randomly without coherence which makes my window go *bing* sometimes" :)
[17:50:05] <kwilczynski> rawtaz: I am.
[17:50:16] <nakedeyes> rawtaz: and you?
[17:50:19] <rawtaz> oh man, i thought you were older than that
[17:50:22] <kwilczynski> rawtaz: August 1984.
[17:50:23] <rawtaz> like 50+ or something
[17:50:28] <rawtaz> nakedeyes: 40
[17:50:41] <kwilczynski> rawtaz: Oh really?
[17:50:54] <kwilczynski> I guess it's my monocle and a tuxedo that has this mature charm to it.
[17:50:55] <kwilczynski> :>
[17:50:58] <rawtaz> kwilczynski: see - you come across as much older! you cant even type ORLY properly ;P
[17:51:07] <rawtaz> yeah that would be true
[17:51:34] <kwilczynski> OK, now that the truth is out.
[17:52:00] <kwilczynski> And you are 40, which makes you older than me, a senpai.
[17:52:06] <rawtaz> it does
[17:52:08] <kwilczynski> I need to be nice to you and carry your groceries.
[17:52:11] <kwilczynski> Damn.
[17:52:15] <shad> anyone ever used clonezilla here to restore 4To disks ?
[17:52:17] <rawtaz> all your elderly benefits vanished in a second there :P
[17:52:20] <nakedeyes> kwilczynksi: weechat wont give me any bings. :D
[17:52:35] <kwilczynski> nakedeyes: :P
[17:52:43] <rawtaz> shad: not i!
[17:52:50] <kwilczynski> shad: Not precisely 4TB but in general yes.
[17:52:53] <kwilczynski> shad: Why? :)
[17:53:07] <kwilczynski> (not that it would matter to CloneZilla)
[17:53:14] <nakedeyes> i think we uncovered a lot today already.
[17:53:25] <kwilczynski> nakedeyes: You did dig deep, didn't you?
[17:53:26] <kwilczynski> ;/
[17:53:38] <shad> so i have a disk #1 with grub, linux, a bunch of programs installed. I want that disk to be cloned onto disk #2
[17:54:02] <rawtaz> i'd just reinstall on the new one and copy over the stuff needed
[17:54:07] <rawtaz> thats how lazy i am
[17:54:14] <kwilczynski> shad: You might find out that rsync might be quicker.
[17:54:17] <nakedeyes> kwilczynski: what could i say, i like depth.
[17:54:25] <shad> So I made a clonezilla image of the disk, and try to restore-image that to disk #2, process goes fine, operation is okayed, clonezilla even able to chroot onto the disk
[17:54:31] <shad> trying to boot onto the disk, nothing
[17:54:39] <kwilczynski> shad: EFI?
[17:54:54] <kwilczynski> shad: You might need to boot into recovery mode and reinstall GRUB.
[17:55:27] <shad> thing is, i would do otherwise if I could
[17:55:48] <shad> because, i'm trying to make it work now for 1 disk, so that our manufacturer can make it happen for ... about a 100 more
[17:56:06] <kwilczynski> I also assume not errors and whatever resize you did also succeeded?
[17:56:47] <shad> i suspect some bullshitery with GPT partitions, but i don't exactly know what i'm doing
[17:57:07] <shad> i can talk kubernetes, Docker and HTTP all day though. But Clonezilla ? man...
[17:57:18] <kwilczynski> shad: CloneZilla should take care of it for you too, hopefully.
[17:57:40] <kwilczynski> shad: Can you mount the file systems there under the old image/disk?
[17:57:46] <shad> the disks are the same 4To Samsung's, and yeah i hoped clonezilla did the whole thing itself
[17:58:27] <kwilczynski> shad: When you are booking the other disk, it's a 1-to-1 swap or as a second drive or something like that? SATA? SAS? NVMe? SSD?
[17:59:50] <shad> I booted Clonezilla, cloned disk #1 onto a USB drive, powered off, swapped disk #1 to #2, boot clonezilla, restore image
[18:00:12] <shad> disks are wired with SATA
[18:01:19] <shad> I'm trying again with an advanced option named "rewrite MBR after installation" right now, but i don't know if it'll change anything
[18:01:37] <shad> also, i thought this was supposed to be called GPT now that i'm using 4To drives
[18:05:04] <shad> "EFI system partition was _NOT_ found on this hard drive: /dev/sda"
[18:05:07] <shad> could that be it ?
[18:05:55] <kwilczynski> Might be. Which is why I asked about EFI above.
[18:06:19] <kwilczynski> And yes, you would need GPT.
[18:06:22] <kwilczynski> What file systems?

[21:45:11] <kwilczynski> The ship.
[21:45:17] <slaughter> Great series
[21:45:20] <slaughter> I need to finish it
[21:45:29] <kwilczynski> Oh.
[21:45:30] <slaughter> Well, not the show. The show can suck it, but I'm halfway through book 8
[21:45:32] <kwilczynski> Read the books!
[21:45:38] <kwilczynski> \o/
[21:45:48] <kwilczynski> I just finished the latest one.
[21:45:53] <kwilczynski> I need moar.
[21:46:04] <slaughter> I listen to them on my runs. Just been listening to music lately or I'd be about done I think
[21:46:16] <kwilczynski> Audiobooks?
[21:46:21] <kwilczynski> I can't consume books like that. ;/
[21:46:23] <slaughter> Aye
[21:46:31] <slaughter> That's too bad, it's a great format
[21:46:33] <kwilczynski> My brain is broken.
[21:46:47] <slaughter> I mean, definitely don't get everything out of the book in audiobook format, but it's better than nothing
[21:47:03] <slaughter> I'd say whatever I get from reading, I get like 80% from audiobooks. 90% if I'm not running at the time
[21:47:04] <kwilczynski> When I read, I can imagine, almost seeing the scene playing out, when I listen... this does not happen.
[21:47:13] <slaughter> Eh plenyt of people can't do audiobooks, not just you
[21:47:22] <kwilczynski> Ahh, really
[21:47:37] * kwilczynski is now on the bell curve somewhere, with some other outliers
[21:47:38] <kwilczynski> :)
[21:50:40] <kwilczynski> Speaking of which.
[21:50:57] <kwilczynski> I wonder how much of the future they got right in the books.
[21:51:16] <kwilczynski> Overpopulation, people on "basic".
[21:51:26] <kwilczynski> Earth being unable to grow crops.
[21:51:46] <slaughter> I think it's a bit of a pessimistic view but probably more or less on point
[21:51:52] <kwilczynski> Colonies on moon and Mars are probably a given.
[21:52:07] <slaughter> That last point there is defintely going to end up correct - we're headed straight towards crop failures already
[21:52:33] <kwilczynski> There is some cool medical technology.
[21:52:39] <kwilczynski> Growing limbs back?
[21:52:41] <slaughter> In line with pessimistic views, I doubt we'll get to the colonies on Mars point before we die out from climate change
[21:52:50] <kwilczynski> Spine fixing surgeries. Cancer medicine.
[21:53:00] <kwilczynski> Ahh
[21:53:03] <kwilczynski> You reckon?
[21:53:26] <slaughter> I have a very cynical and pessimistic (aka realist) view on the future of humanity
[21:53:57] <slaughter> Considering how bad last year was, and the fact that we're doing nothing about it so it's going to get worse...yeah I think we're past the brink and going full steam ahead into the pit
[21:56:25] <slaughter> I really hope I'm wrong, to be clear. 
[22:09:52] <kwilczynski> :)
[22:18:23] <slaughter> We have scientists coming out of every single nook and cranny in every field basically screaming that it's now or never, and the best any corporation or government can do is "plan to reduce X by 50% before 2050". 
[22:18:35] <slaughter> 2040 if they're really progressive
[22:18:48] <slaughter> "it'll cost too much" etc. Grinds my gears
[22:18:58] <slaughter> But not as much as living in Mad Max will

[23:18:34] <dan_pena> hello
[23:18:42] <nakedeyes> how so?
[23:19:04] <dan_pena> I'm looking for documentation on how to structure in the right way a project (for my gitlab project)
[23:19:13] <dan_pena> Maybe I can get some help here

[23:20:11] <nakedeyes> hi, it depends on the codebase and its purpose. can you give us more info?
[23:28:01] <rawtaz> dan_pena: gitlab? in that case you can simply put all your files in one and the same folder - /dev/null
[23:28:11] <rawtaz> no need to complicate it more than that :)
[23:28:25] <rawtaz> then you can go have a look at gitea :)
[23:28:36] <nakedeyes> +1 gitea
[23:28:50] <slaughter> Gitea is pretty great
[23:29:04] <slaughter> Well, I haven't used it for anything more than backing things up, but it's pretty great at that
[23:29:14] <slaughter> Setup on my NAS was about 30 seconds
[23:29:19] <rawtaz> i guess the only downside with gitea is that it has less/no integration with ci/cd at least not to the extent that e.g. gitlab has
[23:33:40] <slaughter> You can use Drone with it, and a few other random things. So it has some CI/CD. 
[23:34:25] <dan_pena> Anyway that's not the question haha
[23:35:15] <slaughter> Doesn't matter what your destination provider is, just what your project is. 
[23:35:32] <slaughter> What kind of project is it dan_pena ? What language, what tools are you using, etc
[23:38:48] <nakedeyes> if you are unsure how to structure, one way to go, is putting everything into the root dir, and organizing later as it grows and categories are getting well distinguishable
