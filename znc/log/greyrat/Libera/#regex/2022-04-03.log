[16:20:29] <re101-cougar-74> Hi! I'm looking for a regular expression to validate a field on my google forms. We're trying to collect "Name of affiliation, address". I've come across a regex here (https://regex101.com/r/aO5rV7/1) that covers the address bit, but I need the name of the company/institution as well. Help?
[16:21:51] <re101-cougar-74> For a sample, we could use "Botswana Institute for Technology Research and Innovation (BITRI), 10062 Samora Machel Dr, Gaborone"

[16:55:21] <re101-cougar-74> THANK YOU!
[16:58:20] <purplex> Do those names and addresses come in a single line?
[16:58:30] <re101-cougar-74> Yes
[16:58:59] <purplex> Add a ^ in front as well to make sure it doesn't yield unexpected results on bad data
[17:01:20] <purplex> unless you want me to re-write it (some users don't understand when I say "add a ^ in front"): https://regex101.com/r/3BfTVS/2 
[17:02:36] <re101-cougar-74> Oh, great. I was on the right track. Adding it to my form and testing again
[17:03:52] <purplex> what does testing say this time?
[17:08:06] <re101-cougar-74> The addresses are "valid" even if I just write the city name. I would like it strictly in the format I shared above. Is that possible?
[17:11:05] <purplex> some number followed by any string?

[17:56:05] <re101-coati-41> how does that work?
[17:56:23] <purplex> yes you must use first one, re101-cougar-74
[17:56:58] <purplex> 2nd one, re101-cougar-74
[17:58:59] <purplex> re101-coati-41: it selects text between parenthesis that is before a word NOA, but 
[17:59:20] <purplex> since you are in my pm i might answer there
[17:59:22] <re101-coati-41> I just realized while this works to select the text between parenthesis it does not select between the first and last parethesis https://regex101.com/r/IvyLha/1
[17:59:33] <re101-coati-41> yes just answer here
[17:59:49] <re101-coati-41> But after testing I realize it will cut off

[18:04:55] <re101-coati-41> but that does work
