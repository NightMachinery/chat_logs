[00:20:23] <kraftwerk28> I get broken treesitter highlighting when setting `foldmethod` to `expr` and `foldexpr` to `nvim_treesitter#foldexpr()` right after running neovim. Though after `:edit` it gets fixed. Any solution to this?
[00:20:32] <jaawerth[m]> buu: well, same idea, but <c-y> on the right - but you may want <expr> so you can check pumvisible(). are you doing it from viml or lua?
[00:20:56] <buu> complete_CTRL-Y When the popup menu is displayed you can use CTRL-Y to stop completion and accept the currently selected entry.  The CTRL-Y is not inserted.  Typing a space, Enter, or some other unprintable character will leave completion mode and insert that typed character.
[00:21:03] <buu> jaawerth[m]: viml
[00:22:12] <buu> I mean, doesn't generally each mapping live in a specific context
[00:22:31] <buu> Is there a context for completion mode?
[00:23:02] <buu> I guess it's a more general question about pumvisible()?<stuff>:stuff all the time
[00:24:12] <buu> sub-mode of Insert and Replace modes.  You enter CTRL-X mode by typing CTRL-X
[00:24:47] <buu> So confused
[00:26:40] <jaawerth[m]> tbh I don't think about it that deeply and just roll with the pumvisible of it all
[00:26:49] <jaawerth[m]> afaik there isn't a way to query that as a minor mode or pending state  but I could be wrong
[00:28:21] <jaawerth[m]> buu: anyway can you be more specific? do you just uwant to map something to <c-y> or is it more complicated than that?

[12:25:00] <channoti> Hi all, there is a list of patches for CVEs in vim that does not seem to have reached nvim. Is nvim not affected by CVE-2021-3973?
[12:26:27] <channoti> The POC triggers segfault, but I do not want to recompile nvim with sanitizer to verify the heap-buffer-overflow
[12:26:53] <vigoux[m]> Looks like we are indeed affected then
[12:27:11] <vigoux[m]> The thing is that the fix is as easy as porting the patch from nvim
[12:27:13] <vigoux[m]> s/nvim/vim/
[12:28:10] <vigoux[m]> Do you have the list of patches you refer to somewhere ? And do you know how to port patches ?
[12:28:21] <channoti> There has been a filerename between vim and nvim, but yes
[12:29:00] <channoti> I have a list of patched CVE in Debian testing changelogs
[12:29:17] <vigoux[m]> Then we'll need to port all of those
[12:29:28] <channoti> CVEs which are linked to the corresponded commit on cvedetails
[12:29:39] <vigoux> Great
[12:29:46] <channoti> But I do not know if they all affect nvim
[12:29:51] <vigoux> (sorry little change of interface)
[12:30:05] <vigoux> The policy is: port the patches you want to
[12:30:32] <vigoux> So even if the CVEs do not actually apply (which is pretty unlikely tbf), porting the patch will not hurt
[12:32:05] <channoti> Ok, I'm reading the "merging patches[...]" wiki, and I'll open PR for those patches

[19:05:54] <jaawerth> since luvit mamnages to do things well, but it does so by building a node-esque core api/core library, which isn't really what youd' want to pull into nvim..

[19:24:43] *** Joins: codeswhite (~codeswhit@user/codeswhite)
[19:25:09] <gpanders> you still have to use `wall`, or you can append `|w` to the `:cfdo` command
[19:25:45] <gpanders> `:cfdo` might not operate on the current buffer, which would explain why the interactive preview doesn't appear
[19:26:03] <gpanders> if the current buffer is in the quickfix list then theoretically the interactive preview would make sense, but I'm not sure if it's supported or not

[20:28:34] <kylo252[m]> it's not always about the timeout either, it's useful for chaining commands or on the fly processing

[20:34:18] <kylo252[m]> idk, if we can translate that user-case that they mention to `<C-c>` should also interact with the servers 🤔
[20:34:37] <kylo252[m]> s/,//, s/user/use/
[20:34:52] <mjlbach[m]> no
[20:35:13] <mjlbach[m]> also 99% of requests are returned extremely quickly
[20:35:20] <mjlbach[m]> this is not worth optimizing
[20:37:48] <kylo252[m]> the easiest is probably hooking into it from `$/progress` to achieve the same thing
[20:38:09] <mjlbach[m]> what
[20:38:40] <kylo252[m]> if the server supports progress reporting, it should be possible to cancel the running operation through that interface
[20:38:45] <mjlbach[m]> no
[20:38:48] <kylo252[m]> as far as I can tell
[20:40:01] <mjlbach[m]> Try implementing it
[20:40:42] <kylo252[m]> it says in the protocol that you can use it with references
[20:41:36] <mjlbach[m]> sure, go for it
[20:42:53] <kylo252[m]> not sure if ironic, but it requires some kind of "contract" anyway of how to define the interface for it

[21:35:32] <andreypopp[m]> mjlbach: this is what I have, 0.6.0
[21:35:40] <kylo252[m]> <andreypopp[m]> "When I open a random (outside of..." <- null-ls should only complain once, and then the source should get de-registered. that said the dynamic_cmd feat is nearly complete, it should be able to resolve based on the locally installed node-module
[21:36:35] <andreypopp[m]> maybe having no log messages at all would be even great, now I think
[21:37:21] <kylo252[m]> andreypopp[m]: for either? you can set both logging levels to "error" and it should be fine, since both of these seem like warnings 
[21:37:51] <andreypopp[m]> the null-ls one follows the ones I posted above and it says ERROR
[21:39:00] <kylo252[m]> but it does it once, correct? there's a slightly convoluted way to get around it: https://github.com/jose-elias-alvarez/null-ls.nvim/issues/509#issuecomment-1002950065

[21:39:58] <kylo252[m]> you can probably use `on_new_config` to manipulate the start_cmd with lspconfig, but I'm not sure if it'll work for all cases
[21:40:26] <andreypopp[m]> yes, null-ls message appears only once
[21:40:50] <mjlbach[m]> That's more a limitation of the messags pane

[21:43:28] <mjlbach[m]> I'd rather fix/allow messages to not require a press enter prompt
[21:45:32] <andreypopp[m]> maybe... but at the same time, it's not uncommon to use vim to edit/view files ad-hoc, w/o all the setup, would be nice not to see warnings/errors in those cases (just thinking out loud)

[21:48:14] <mjlbach[m]> I mean, you can view/edit files ad-hoc
[21:48:19] <mjlbach[m]> lspconfig works fine with single files, you just need to make sure `cmd` points to a valid server location
[21:50:18] *** Joins: epony (epony@user/epony)
[21:51:03] <andreypopp[m]> if I have to do some configuration then it's not ad-hoc. Also by ad-hoc I mean editing files in a non-installed project.
[21:51:11] <mjlbach[m]> That's what I mean to
[21:51:20] <mjlbach[m]> it works with no configuration if the server is globally on your path
[21:51:29] <andreypopp[m]> but I don't have it globally
[21:51:30] <mjlbach[m]> s/to/too/
[21:51:33] <andreypopp[m]> and don't want to have
[21:51:41] <mjlbach[m]> Well, then you need to add a single line :) 
[21:52:01] <andreypopp[m]> so there's no way to disable those messages? 
[21:52:02] <mjlbach[m]> no
[21:52:13] <mjlbach[m]> lspconfig calls start_client, start_client throws that warning because it can't start the server
[21:52:51] <andreypopp[m]> would you be open to a PR which can make more intelligent decision on when to call start_client? Like resolving if there's an executable available?
[21:53:14] <mjlbach[m]> no
[21:53:18] <mjlbach[m]> I removed that actually
[21:53:59] <mjlbach[m]> The server isn't always an executable
[21:54:21] <mjlbach[m]> it can be over a TCP connection (think remove servers or godot), or piped via distant.nvim

[21:54:32] <mjlbach[m]> or PATH can be modified via cmd_env
[21:54:51] <mjlbach[m]> if the message really bothers you, then you can silence it with a vim.notify filter
[21:55:08] <andreypopp[m]> fair
[21:55:35] <mjlbach[m]> The solution is to add more flexible rules to lspconfig for when to launch servers
[21:55:57] <mjlbach[m]> which I am working on
[21:55:59] <kylo252[m]> mjlbach[m]: I was just gonna say, I remember it was possible to hack a validation check for the `buf_try_add`, probably still is, but it's not straight forward
[21:56:03] <mjlbach[m]> (not specifically for this)
[21:56:43] <andreypopp[m]> mjlbach[m]: This is great! I think this is what I was asking. Looking forward to it.
[21:56:59] <kylo252[m]> now lua-autocmds would be helpful here, since you would be able to expose the callback :)
[21:57:00] <andreypopp[m]> tbh I very liked how ALE handled that (discovery and launch of LSP/linters)

[21:57:29] <mjlbach[m]> Yeah, I don't want to silence errors but I'd be fine letting people write an arbitrary executable check themselves
[21:58:01] <andreypopp[m]> that'd be very useful, probably some standard executable checks can be default
[21:58:21] <mjlbach[m]> I mean, we had those, those are what I removed
