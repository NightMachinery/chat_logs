[17:17:05] <re101-deer-85> yes, its reloading...

[17:20:17] <Lindrian> Thanks. Not sure what went wrong here.
[17:20:20] <Lindrian> Does Ctrl+F5 fix it?
[17:21:12] <digitok> no, but hard refresh does
[17:22:58] <digitok> well, it was fixing it before, but not now
[17:23:35] <digitok> also note it only does it on a saved regex link, not on the main page
[17:25:05] <re101-deer-85> digitok, Please send that regex
[17:25:20] <Lindrian> oh wtf

[20:58:34] <OnlineCop> re101-poodle-46: Since your character set allows `\s` (whitespace), you'd match (but not capture) whitespace after the '^' (probably with `\s*` or `[\t ]*`) and then your {3,39} range would need to be lazy/minimal by appending '?' to the end of it. Then you'd match more whitespace between the end of that and the '$'.
[20:59:27] <OnlineCop> re101-poodle-46: https://regex101.com/r/IbbtQg/2 is one way to do it, where you would only be interested in the captured group contents.
[21:01:16] <OnlineCop> If you're using PCRE and don't want to deal with a capturing group, put `\K` after `^[ \t]*` so that it matches, but then discards, the whitespace before your text. You'll keep the lazy/minimal `{3,39}?` quantifier, but then wrap the `[ \t]*$` at the end in a look-ahead: `(?=[ \t]*$)`. Something like this: https://regex101.com/r/IbbtQg/3
[21:01:52] <OnlineCop> (And sorry for the hour-long delay; I'm at work and only sometimes check in on IRC.)
[21:05:22] <re101-poodle-46> Thanks a lot OnlineCop
[21:05:27] <re101-poodle-46> I will try this
[21:11:06] <OnlineCop> There is a minor issue with this:
[21:11:45] <OnlineCop> Your string is expecting 3-39 characters (including "internal" whitespace, I imagine). This won't take into account that leading/trailing whitespace into that 3-39 character count, if that's okay.
[21:12:04] <re101-poodle-46> Yes thats ok
[21:12:52] <re101-poodle-46> I modified the leading spaces group to [a-zA-Z] as my string should start only with letters
[21:12:56] <re101-poodle-46> thank you
[21:13:02] <OnlineCop> My pleasure.
[21:13:19] <OnlineCop> And don't forget that you can always update the regex101 page and use 'Update Regex'.
[21:13:34] <OnlineCop> Then you can test out any other strings to make sure those work as you're hoping.
[21:13:34] <re101-poodle-46> sure
[21:18:04] <OnlineCop> Two things to note on version /4: without the /m flag, `^` and `$` match the beginning and end of the entire string, not just per-line. Your text contains a newline in it, so the '$' won't match that properly (unless you change the `(?=[ \t]*$)` to `(?=\s*$)` so `\s` matches newlines as well.
[21:18:40] <OnlineCop> The second thing to note is that your TEST STRING does contain leading whitespace, so `^` (start of string) followed by `[a-zA-Z]` requires that the letters begin immediately at the start of the line.
[21:25:15] *** Joins: f00 (~timm@user/timm)
[21:25:36] <re101-poodle-46> my string should fail vaildation if it has leading spaces and it should only start with letters
[21:27:45] <re101-poodle-46> I dont need new lines, when I copy pasted, it accidentally had that. My bad sorry for the confusion. But it is working as expected now and will make a note of your comments if I face any issues with that. Thanks a lot for looking into again OnlineCop
[21:29:43] <OnlineCop> 👍
