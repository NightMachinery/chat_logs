[00:51:57] <InPhase> pyzozord: Indentation and line-based spacing tends to be a little more intuitive though.  For as much as experienced programmers complain about it, Python did correctly identify that beginners will find that a little easier as long as there are no tabs involved.

[01:09:04] <sonny> I've seen many yaml rageposts so I thought maybe something was up
[01:09:06] <apotheon> There are some unnecessary complexities in YAML, and it would be nice to simplify it a bit, though.
[01:09:31] <sonny> pyzozord that is a possiblity 
[01:09:32] <arahael> apotheon: and history, i quite dislike YAML because older formats were particularly ambigious and i havent really caught up to the newer formats.  i do feel it is unneccessarily complex.
[01:09:56] <apotheon> JSON has the benefit of being a simpler data language than YAML, but YAML is a better designed data language at its core, in my opinion.

[01:10:16] <InPhase> apotheon: We had an open discussion evaluation of yaml vs json at my work for a standardization.  In the end we went with json across the board for those file types, because we could dual-use it for json-lines event streams.  (One area yaml does not work.)  And because there are slightly more tools available for json parsing.
[01:10:36] <apotheon> I think it would be a good idea to agree on a YAML syntactic subset and promote that.
[01:10:52] <pyzozord> so object files are more like elfs - executable binary, but just they are libraries
[01:11:24] <InPhase> apotheon: And then every once in a while we get some error happening in production because someone dropped a comma somewhere while editing a json file.

[01:11:40] <apotheon> InPhase: It's true that YAML doesn't work for use cases that explicitly require JSON.
[01:11:53] <apotheon> . . . but that's not a reflection on the language itself.
[01:11:59] <pyzozord> im wondering if I made a language how would I make call libraries like opengl, I can't rewrite entire opengl in my language
[01:12:10] <InPhase> apotheon: Well the inability to pack complex structures on one line is sometimes a deficit.
[01:12:29] <flakland> pyzozord you use the systems C abi to call into the library

[01:13:46] <flakland> its an ABI
[01:13:51] <InPhase> apotheon: Well for programming, sometimes you want to pack a short bit of illustration code on line line to share it over IRC for example.  For the json-lines event streams I mentioned, it's very helpful to open up a log of these event streams in a text editor and see each one sequentially in its own line.

[01:15:10] <pyzozord> im confusd by the "systems c abi" I though there isn't a system's abi
[01:15:21] <flakland> why wouldnt there be a ABI
[01:15:36] <pyzozord> because each language has it's own abi
[01:15:38] <flakland> then no libs would be able to coopoerate

[01:16:44] <apotheon> . . . though I'm really not convinced that packing it all into a single line is ever all that great an idea.
[01:16:51] <pyzozord> flakland: but what was the "c abi" part in your message then? is it system abi or c abi
[01:16:57] <apotheon> If you don't want multiple lines in IRC, use a pastebin.
[01:16:58] <flakland> the C calling convention
[01:17:26] <pyzozord> flakland: meaning the os adapted th c abi, and now os abi is the same as c abi?

[01:18:44] <pyzozord> i'm trying to undersatnd how languages do interop

[01:19:13] <pyzozord> ah
[01:19:19] <apotheon> InPhase: That's an example of how there are notations available in YAML that allow single-line packing, though I recommend against it for the much same reason I'd recommend against JSON.

[02:34:09] <nomagno> "In Christianity, a minister is a person authorised by a church or other religious organization to perform functions such as teaching of beliefs; leading services such as weddings, baptisms or funerals; or otherwise providing spiritual guidance to the community. The term is taken from Latin minister ("servant", "attendant")"

[02:35:34] <sonny> nomagno padre
[02:35:37] <apotheon> In practice, "minister" is applied to more than just Christian faiths.
[02:36:16] <sonny> padre == minister, sorta
[02:36:33] <jkk> i did not go to a shop and now it is closed :
[02:36:34] <jkk> haha

[02:36:48] <sonny> yeah
[02:36:53] <jkk> apotheon: do you provide matching services? :)
[02:36:57] <apotheon> Padre is used to refer to a Catholic priest in Spanish, and Father is used to refer to a Catholic priest in English.
[02:37:00] <nomagno> It seems the term 'minister' is predominantly applied in protestant churches, in both Spanish and English

[02:45:25] <jkk> if you have people willing to marry rest is easy
[02:45:27] <InPhase> apotheon: There are two methods that seem to work.  One is using some site that connects people up, with different ones being good for different skill levels and types of work.  The other is to build up a network for which you have a reputation.  Either you'll get long contract jobs from that network, in which case you're a short term employee without benefits, or you'll spend a lot of your time (up 
[02:45:33] <InPhase> to half) tracking own new work from this network of contacts, and you'll need to charge twice per hour compared to what you need to make to compensate for the time it takes to land contracts.

[02:47:38] <sonny> it's not possible to hire marketing folk?

[03:03:26] <apotheon> nomagno: Yeah, for public rooms it's harder to make that meaningful, but at the very minimum with an end-to-end encrypted Matrix channel you can at least know who's able to log what people are saying.
[03:04:05] <apotheon> nomagno: Meanwhile, on IRC, the netops can at any time just log every channel if they have the interest and resources to do so.

[03:50:53] <KillerWasp> [itchyjunk]: When you install an irc server it is not accompanied by users so that you do not feel alone and stay motivated.

[03:52:10] <[itchyjunk]> it has users, and you'll be an oper of a larger network.

[11:05:57] <fweht> hey, id like to experiment with realtime audio, like building my own oscillators or effects, it seems that most of this stuff is done in c or cpp but somehow i dont want to learn c(pp) in 2021, so the other two languages which seem to be supportive on that are rust and swift.   any reason to pick one over the other?
[11:07:43] <Decker> audio processing is actually really small amount of data... you can do a lot with software transforms in webaudio too https://noisehack.com/custom-audio-effects-javascript-web-audio-api/ for example
[11:07:44] <bayaz> Title: Custom Audio Effects in JavaScript with the Web Audio API 
[11:08:07] <flakland> yeah, any non-interpretted lang will do
[11:08:11] <Decker> and you can record and playback at the same time if you connect to mic and sound sources
[11:08:15] <Decker> JS isn't interpreted
[11:08:23] <flakland> (js being mostly JIT'd) should be good
[11:08:40] <fweht> Decker: ah cool, yeah i experimented already with the web audio api, but i had the assumption that it would be not so fast as other implementations?

[11:09:40] <Decker> fweht I would be it is fast enough... and gets you iphone and android too instead of just computers
[11:10:04] <fweht> Decker: thats true, but with rust i could target wasm with the same effect (being portable)
[11:10:05] <Decker> the marshalling of data between WasmVM and JS engine is a lot of overhead
[11:10:11] <Decker> lots of extra copies goin on there
[11:10:18] <fweht> ah ok good to know!

[12:49:44] <arahael> But for example, when I order my groceries...  Lets say I order $200 of groceries.  The payment happens *immediately*.  The particular store I use makes me book the delivery slot ahead of the shopping, which is a bit odd but works really well.  I pick my items, and pay it.  I then shortly get an email telling me exactly when it will be delivered.

[13:22:17] <arahael> Like, a 4k screen... For each eye...  In 1" of space.
[13:22:54] <arahael> By contrast, the one I'm getting is 1832x1920 per eye.

[13:24:33] <mrig> just pondering the scaling, iv a HD resolution screen on a 12" laptop, which is nice for working close to the screen, 1/4 of that would be 4k I think. Up close that is quite pixely.
[13:26:08] <arahael> It's quite a lot of dots.
[13:26:23] <arahael> At this level, they have to selectively optimise which pixels they choose to simulate, so it's not a uniform density.
[13:26:25] <mrig> indeed, very dotty! :D
[13:26:48] <mrig> oh does it track the eye, or something like that?
[13:28:32] <arahael> I'm not sure.  The one I'm getting doesn't, unfortunately.  But the best focus is usually right ahead, I think, such that you're instructed to move the head, and not the eyes, for the best vision.

[13:29:10] <pyzozord> I was trying to design a static language yesterday and I have to say it's hard to do
[13:29:14] <pyzozord> it turns out so ugly
[13:29:55] <pyzozord> I had one idea: there is no curlies or any other denotation of code block. Everything is flat level
[13:30:13] <pyzozord> the function ends when you declare another function
[13:30:50] <deniska> pyzozord: assembly :D
[13:31:04] <pyzozord> yeah a bit :D
[13:31:19] <pyzozord> but same goes for all other syntax with code blocks like conditions or loops
[13:31:24] <deniska> although a lot of dialects have what's called "local labels"
[13:31:39] <deniska> pyzozord: how do you nest things though? :P
[13:32:15] <deniska> pyzozord: have you seen today's AoC?
[13:32:17] <pyzozord> I'm not sure. There is escape hatch. You can use "end" keyword to explicitly end the scope and get back up one level

[13:39:19] <deniska> pyzozord: no, how would it?

[13:39:53] <deniska> pyzozord: I mean, the points of each scanner are literally in the input :)
[13:40:25] <deniska> just because you represent them in a different coordinate system, they still should be the same distinct points
[13:41:03] <pyzozord> but I mean if the input can have 2 points at the same location for the same scanner
[13:41:24] <pyzozord> like sensor 0: [(0,0),(0,1),(0,0)]
[13:41:58] <pyzozord> I'll assume it can't, that way I can make a sensor a set and it makes things easier

[15:05:47] <deniska> pyzozord: in python it works like this, if you define __eq__, you also have to define your own __hash__
[15:06:15] <deniska> pyzozord: and __hash__ isn't supposed to change during the lifetime of an object
[15:06:38] <deniska> pyzozord: so for mutable things you either hash by identity (the default), or not hash at all, otherwise bad things happen
[15:06:42] <pyzozord> can't __hash__ just be == id()
[15:07:04] <pyzozord> or, is it possible that objects are moved in memory
[15:07:05] <deniska> pyzozord: it can, but then __eq__ should also better compare identity
[15:07:18] <deniska> no, id() doesn't change during the lifetime of an object
[15:07:58] <deniska> pyzozord: basically if two object compare equal, they should have the same hash
[15:08:08] <deniska> and by should I probably mean must
[15:08:13] <pyzozord> oh right right
[15:08:37] <pyzozord> because I cared about "if it's the same object" but there is also "it looks identical but it's another object"
[15:08:40] <deniska> mutable collections in python override comparison, so they don't have any kind of hash which would make sense
[15:09:45] <pyzozord> I'll try taking id() of set instead of using fronzenset. Fronzenset is fine except makes debug output less readable
[15:10:48] <pyzozord> ehh, well id is not better, then it's just random numbers, why didn't I think of that

[16:43:31] <ProfSimm> bjs: I think the road ahead is to make "type system" and "code execution" the same thing, then you don't need to specify all types in a system, you let the program define the system and it checks itself
[16:44:04] <bjs> In actual fact there are lots of secret dependent types in places you don't expect.  `printf` is usually dependently typed (very hackily) because it makes things nicer for the programmer
[16:44:11] <nomagno> That doesn't sound very useful
[16:44:12] <Decker> units without values don't work :)

[16:44:34] <nomagno> If a program generates types by itself, it might as well be untyped
[16:44:50] <bjs> ProfSimm: well the point of a type system is to check your code before you run it, if the system has to run and then just generates the types it actually saw then that's pretty useless
[16:45:08] <ProfSimm> What if a system always runs, even as you type code.
[16:45:10] <bjs> ProfSimm: in a fully generic dependently typed system then every syntactically valid program has a valid assignment of types,  so you gain nothing
[16:45:19] <Decker> nomagno :) that's a tree falls in the forest question; is a thing untyped if a thing generates its types?

[19:37:43] <pikapika> Complex numbers are very friendly and nice
[19:37:44] <sonny> I see
[19:37:57] <ProfSimm> Complex numbers aren't just two numbers though, although sometimes used as such.
[19:37:59] <[itchyjunk]> complex numbers are also not imaginary number
[19:38:03] <[itchyjunk]> but the other way around
[19:38:20] <[itchyjunk]> R^2 is isomorphic to C
[19:38:31] <[itchyjunk]> so complex numbers are tuples of 2 real numbers
[19:38:38] <[itchyjunk]> (x,y) \in R^2
[19:38:45] <sonny> so that's why people like algebra
[19:38:49] <[itchyjunk]> you just define vector multiplication
[19:38:57] <[itchyjunk]> People like algebra?!?
[19:39:02] <sonny> cause you can do funky stuff when you have an isomorphism
[19:39:11] <InPhase> [itchyjunk] is correct.  You can redo all of complex numbers as just orthogonal 2-tuples following a rotation rule.

[19:43:07] <sonny> time can't be 2d, that would just be boring
[19:43:10] <pikapika> With quadratics, the people could have waved away equations like x^2+2=0 as having no roots since it does not cross the x axis
[19:43:23] <pikapika> but some cubics have real roots but which involve i in their expression
[19:43:31] <pyzozord> (or another dimmention I should say probably)
[19:44:05] <[itchyjunk]> another plane makes sense too, there
[19:44:13] <pikapika> pyzozord, there is nothing deep about imaginary numbers
[19:44:28] <pikapika> As mentioned its just a convenient 2d vector
[19:45:00] <pikapika> and in a format where change in phase is as easy as a multiplication
[19:45:03] <ProfSimm> It's not just a 2D vector folks
[19:45:04] <InPhase> pyzozord: They're only in another direction.  The plane is what you get by combining imaginary and non-imaginary numbers.  Just think x is real, y is imaginary, and the multiplication is that 1 is a 0 degree rotation, i is a 90 degree rotation, -1 is a 180 degree rotation, and thus -i is a 270 degree rotation.  Other than the special multiplication rule, they act like a 2D coordinate.

[23:12:28] <EdFletcher> much preferred to the ESR doc, 1000% 
[23:12:34] <nomagno> Ensir: Right so, if you were asking what features does C have that could make it preferrable over other languages by so many people, I can provide my opinion: 
[23:12:34] <nomagno> It is simple, *feasible* to implement by yourself, straight to the point, flexible, universally supported, integrates with almost any other programming language without issues, can support most any paradigm (despite being purely procedural by default), and the ecosystem of libraries it supports has consistently been in the top 3 in the world since forever.
[23:14:24] <nomagno> Memory safety is pretty much the only point you could objectively improve about it, but garbage collection would take way its performance, and a Rust-style borrow checker probably would make a language that isn't C anymore

[23:18:00] <Raziel> it's definitely a lot more possible to avoid pointers or allocating in C++, for the most part

[23:19:54] <nomagno> Well, mostly
[23:20:04] <mrig> zzzod: depends on what it is that you are writing, by asking this you are essentially considering variable scope, perhaps a more important question would be 'how can I group things together so that I do not require global scope'. If you still need global variables for anything other than very mundane things or when doing anything other than testing out ideas, it is quite likely that you
[23:20:05] <mrig> should be thinking more about how it is that you have structuring your code, that makes them a requirement, and change that.
[23:20:09] <vdamewood> Ensir: s/best/only/ yes
[23:20:16] <Ensir> nomagno, I was once thinking to use structs as a pseudo-class in C.

[23:32:42] <Thedarkb-Desktop> Perhaps BASIC?
[23:32:55] <InPhase> nomagno: I feel confident I could implement C++.  It would just be a massive waste of time.  This makes more sense as a team project, as do C compilers, because the primary reason these languages are still doing well is the massive time investment in optimizer technology.  And while you could implement a basic C compiler in a reasonable period of time, there's no way you're just going to sit down 
[23:33:01] <InPhase> and hammer out a C compiler that has comparable optimization performance to what we are used to getting.

[23:37:13] <InPhase> nomagno: A good example of what happens with that arises when you look at Forth, one of the easiest languages to implement.  The problem is that every Forth program has to then reimplement everything one would need to build a modern system, so consequently every Forth program evolves into its own language.
[23:37:49] <InPhase> nomagno: C programs tend to do that also, where sufficiently complicated C projects with reliability requirements end up implementing features that would be found in C++, but in different ways, and without language support that automates certain things.
