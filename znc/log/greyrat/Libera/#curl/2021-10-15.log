[11:52:00] <gevaerts> And I could easily believe you're below average in the "rich" category, but then there's the people where maybe the neighbours have a phone. They're going to take the average down!
[11:55:28] <bagder> right, but I don't think those without even a phone are among the existing "internet users" when counted globally
[11:55:28] <gevaerts> I'll try to get my CIPC number later today :)
[11:56:01] <gevaerts> True, but they do mean you don't get to multiply whatever number you get by the world population

[11:56:27] <bagder> I'm being modest and "only" multiple with number of internet users
[11:59:17] <bagder> next week I'll serve as "expert witness" in a webscraping trial here in Stockholm
[12:00:00] <gevaerts> I'll try to come up with an estimate for my parents (which I suspect will be low) and for me (a lot higher) later. Now I need to be off for a meeting...
[12:08:08] <dege> bagder: are you called by prosecutor or the defence?
[12:10:02] <bagder> for the defence
[12:11:05] <dege> this will be interesting to hear about when you talk about it
[12:11:21] <dege> *if* a "when" happens that is
[12:11:40] <bagder> yeah, I'll try to not reveal details before my appearance but I think I can speak more after Wednesday
[12:14:34] <GodEater> wait, what?
[12:14:58] <GodEater> ah - I missed the earlier message.
[12:15:27] <bagder> it's a smaller service sued by a major Swedish realtor
[12:16:40] <GodEater> sounds similar to this thing that made the news overnight from missouri (spelling?) yesterday
[12:16:53] <GodEater> apparently "view source" is now a hacking offence
[12:16:55] <bagder> yes, something along those lines
[12:17:59] <GodEater> sounds unpleasant anyway - not something I'd want to have to appear in court over - even if I'm not the accused
[12:18:10] <bagder> the lead lawyer in the case against thepiratebay is the defence lawyer here!
[12:18:15] <GodEater> ah
[12:19:04] <GodEater> I'm not sure how often it happens in real life - but you dramatisations of court sessions seem to have this thing where the barrister / lawyer shuts down the testimony from the expert witness at the point he feels he got the answer he wanted, without listening to the rest of the context.
[12:19:23] <GodEater> s/but you/but you see in/
[12:20:00] <bagder> I've gotten a pretty good explanation for what to expect in the questioning, so I think it'll be fine
[12:20:09] <GodEater> ok good
[12:20:29] <bagder> the defence lawyer will get a chance to "round off" after the prosecutor's lawyer has asked questions
[12:20:51] <GodEater> my thought on that situation (if I'm ever in the unfortunate position of being in it) would be to turn to the judge and ask "I was sworn in to tell the *whole* truth - this person is stopping me from doing that?"
[12:21:37] <GodEater> but again, I don't know how realistic it all is on TV ðŸ˜„
[12:21:55] <bagder> I've also been told that the prosecutor's representative is especially unpleasant so I should expect "bad faith" questions... so, anything can happen =)
[12:22:05] <GodEater> oh boy
[12:22:26] <Piru> fun times
[12:22:49] <bagder> "I've never worked with such an unpleasant opponent" she said, and she's been around...
[12:23:36] <GodEater> then I *really* don't envy you
[12:24:04] <bagder> I do however think that I'm on the right side of the issue, which is why I agreed to this
[12:25:10] <dege> makes sense

[13:11:07] <dege> damnit.. googling for writeups on actual stack overflows with sscanf only yield sscanf usage questions on stackoverflow.com
[13:12:33] <Piru> um. isn't it identical to pretty much any other string stack buffer overflow?
[13:12:59] <Piru> for example strcpy to fixed size stack buffer
[13:13:48] <Piru> okay whitespace typically is a badchar with sscanf though. depends on the actual *scanf statement
[13:14:53] <Piru> for example "%s %s" in which case the exploit can't have chars that match isspace()
[13:15:18] <Piru> but other than that it's pretty much identical to strcpy to stack buffer
[13:16:34] <Piru> assuming you get control of some program counter (either function return or some subroutine called via dereference) then it's just dealing with ASLR, DEP and all that usual jazz
[13:18:32] *** Quits: nevo (~quassel@7thplanet.org) (Quit: ~Cya)
[13:19:27] <Piru> interestingly sscanf family functions are not protected by _FORTIFY_SOURCE -- so in that sense it's exploitable, assuming other factors don't prevent it
[13:19:42] <Piru> stack cookies can ruin your day for example
[13:19:48] <dege> sure it is, I was just curious to read some good case study writeups of such vulns to amuse myself but ended up with crap results .. kind of like when googling for how to embed images in LaTeX .. that requires care

[15:48:38] <Shry> Hello!
[15:53:22] <bagder> o/
[15:58:42] <Shry> I'm making a C++ program which is supposed to make tens of thousands of requests as fast as possible but I'm having an issue on Windows. The way my code works right now is that I'm just creating threads and in each thread I'm using one curl_easy interface to make x amount of requests. My main issue right now appears to be that each thread is making its own DNS hostname resolving request which isnt efficient but I think that also causes requests to fail, maybe 
[15:58:42] <Shry> because the DNS server has rate limit thing or something, this is what each thread keeps printing: "curl_easy_perform() failed: Couldn't resolve host name on thread 0xXXXX". I'm terrible at explaining but my question is whether its possible to make the DNS request one time in the beginning and then all the threads can use that or something. I tried curl_share but I think I'm doing something wrong there (is there a full example on how to use it with std::mutex? I 
[15:58:42] <Shry> found one example but wasnt with std::mutex)
[16:00:09] <Shry> Oh as I was writing this I tested with 1 thread and I still had that "Couldn't resolve host name" issue...
