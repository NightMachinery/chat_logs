[02:36:51] <Albright> â€¦I might mean PEAR.
[02:39:21] <varrg> Is there a neat way of conditionally stop a RecursiveArrayIterator from going deeper, and instead continuing on the next adjacent node?
[02:41:03] <varrg> I can't find any method, just some hooks that might have something to do with it, but they are executed after the fact. I'm already using getSubIterator() with getDepth, to get the chain of nodes, which I could check against to break;, but the iterator would still go down each child

[02:48:02] <ash_worksi> well, I am trying to figure this out and I don't really have any idea where to start; pecl complains on the make stage
[02:48:07] <Albright> But certainly I'd suggest seeing if there's a Composer package first before trying PEAR/PECL.
[02:48:41] <judah> varrg, could you accomplish the same thing using an IteratorIterator that itself is recursive? This way you can decide yourself if you want to recurse or skip
[02:48:51] <Albright> ash_worksi: This looks promising: https://packagist.org/packages/php-amqplib/php-amqplib
[02:49:27] <varrg> judah, I'll look into that. I guess otherwise I'll have to implement Iterator myself, but I'd rather not
[02:49:34] <ash_worksi> I mean... you need both afaik; like, you how you might need the sqlite module installed for the driver to be available to PDO
[02:50:41] <ash_worksi> I mean I guess I'll try that
[02:53:52] <judah> varrg, depending on how you set it up, you could likely get away with a recursive generator. If you need to rewind, just pass the generator to iterator_to_array and call it a day.

[03:19:38] <varrg> I'm going to need it, but it's not strictly important. I have several multidim arrays, I need to iterate them recursively from Array A to C (order is important). For each node chain (specific chain of keys in the array), I need to stop going further if I've already found the same key chain in a previous array
[03:20:16] <varrg> even if their content is different. Effectively Array A's keys will overshadow Array B's key of same name, where keys are unique in their chain of keys
[03:21:11] <__adrian> ...is there something wrong with  foreach ($a + $b as $k => $v) { ... }  ?
[03:21:34] *** Quits: LucaTM (~LucaTM@user/lucatm) (Quit: Textual IRC Client: www.textualapp.com)
[03:21:36] <__adrian> or you have flattening / recursion also?
[03:21:40] <varrg> so I'm keeping a cache: $cache[] = $key; and checking against that: if (in_array($key, $cache)) {}, and I can stop it from processing a found key, but it still continues down the value. So for example if A has: ['foo' => 'scalar'] and B has ['foo' => ['bar' => 'scalar']], I don't want to iterate into foo.bar, because foo was already found in A
[03:22:25] <__adrian> so maybe instead of making valid() return false, you want to make it call ->next()
[03:22:58] <__adrian> but i'm not clear on your requirement and examples don't seem to explain it completely, so ...maybe
[03:23:00] <varrg> next() will still go down a level of the same key if it is an array

[03:33:08] <varrg> __adrian, all in all it's a config system, read a file and have the data as an array, the class will give you setters and getters and ability to write back to file. Allow parent instances without merging

[03:39:08] <varrg> seems unnecessary complex. I've found a reference to the iterator for the child array that should not be traversed. I'll investigate ways to kill it. Perhaps I'll have to move my cache and condition into a custom Iterator class to process it in valid() or hasChildren()

[12:26:09] <ash_worksi> I see

[12:27:04] <ash_worksi> or might there still be cruft, it'll just all be in 1 layer?
[12:27:30] <TinoDidriksen> Almost. It squashes all layers so there's no intermediate state, which multistage also does. But multistage can choose what to copy over, which squash can't. But if you just erase anything non-essential before squashing, it's the same.

[12:29:11] <ash_worksi> What should I look into to determine that? I mean, I have never built any packages on linux before so I don't really know what ancillary files might be created during the install process
[12:30:15] <ash_worksi> I mean, is there a phrase I can look up or something to learn more about it?
[12:31:59] <TinoDidriksen> Good question. Not sure where PECL stores builds. Surely there are some paths shown during build? Probably something like wiping /tmp/*
[12:33:00] <ash_worksi> There is a /tmp/pear dir
[12:33:47] <TinoDidriksen> It's safe to wipe /tmp/* regardless.
[12:34:04] <ash_worksi> right
[12:34:18] <ash_worksi> I am curious if it keeps anything in it
[12:35:53] <ash_worksi> so, for things like rabbitmq and postgresql (I actually haven't tried to just use the composer package for rabbitmq alone, but [shrug]) when you install `postgresql-dev` and `rabbitmq-c-dev`, are those packages that are only necessary for the installation or do the modules themselves require those packages?

[12:42:47] <ash_worksi> To anyone that concievably cared; if rebuilding your image on alpine now breaks with `pecl` or `docker-php-ext-install`, it's not because your missing a package. It's because you didn't pin alpine tightly enough when it worked and your docker version is out-of-date.
[12:43:21] <ash_worksi> that is, only one of those problems need to be solved.
[12:43:34] <TinoDidriksen> Given how unofficial docker-php is, I'd say just use Debian or Ubuntu instead. They ship supported packages for all the modules.

[12:45:32] <ash_worksi> then I tried apt-get install php7-pdo_pgsql and it said, "this package is missing, but there are references to it; it is probably obsoleted"
[12:45:42] <ash_worksi> then I said, "I hate you" and went back to alpine

[12:48:08] <TinoDidriksen> Oh, PDO is a default module.
[12:48:21] <ash_worksi> it does say, "virtual package provided by php7.4-common" though
[12:48:50] <ash_worksi> and the other one says "provided by php7.4-pgsql"
[12:49:20] <ash_worksi> then I tried apt-get install ^that and got: This may mean that the package is missing, has been obsoleted, or
[12:49:29] <TinoDidriksen> The unversioned packages point to the versioned ones, which makes it easier to install because it'll pull in whatever version is on that distro.
[12:49:58] <ash_worksi> Package php7.4-pgsql is not available, but is referred to by another package.  This may mean that the package is missing, has been obsoleted, or is only available from another source
[12:50:07] <ash_worksi> sorry, I meant that ^

[18:50:23] <omegatron> as an alternative to use a single-line comment, which would colorize the line different (which is good), but would lead to a line indentation (which is not good - stupid editor, I know)
[18:51:26] <AllenJB> Use a better editor. Or a multi-line comment. Or version control and remove the code completely.
[18:52:11] <omegatron> so far I have not found a editor in Kubuntu, which has not more disadvantages than Kate  (god, I miss BBEdit from Mac OS X)
[18:53:12] <omegatron> multi-line comment would be not suited in this case (for the sake of readability) and version control is out of the question at this time (I want less not more overhead)
[18:53:38] <judah> less overhead by commenting out code you want removed, uh huh, sure
[18:53:48] <judah> To each their own I suppose
[18:54:01] <omegatron> no, less overhead by not using version control .. read my text properly
[18:54:48] <judah> Sounds like more steps to me. I have worked on old (10+ year) projects where the original authors refused to use version control. There was more commented code than there was actual code. Was an utter nightmare to work with, that could have been easily solved with VCS
[18:54:52] <judah> but you do what works for you
[18:54:58] <judah> ill just poke fun at it :P
[18:55:09] <AllenJB> Version control does not add more overhead in the long run. I highly recommend learning and using it (even on personal projects, even if it is git)
[18:55:46] <judah> What AllenJB said. Just "git init" and keep the repo local. No need to push anywhere. Trust me you are saving yourself a world of hurt down the road
[18:55:49] <omegatron> I said at this point, not forever - if you fail to understand other people's text, then don't comment
[18:56:10] <judah> If you dont like people commenting, you better hop off the internet buddy
[18:56:16] <judah> you are literally on a chat platform
[18:56:27] <judah> I have words to say and you cant stop me :D
[18:57:33] <omegatron> I asked "does someone know for sure, ..."  - so, now I have two people, who don't know for sure, but feel competent enought, to answer .. and one of them completely fails to understand the topic ... well done
[18:59:46] <AllenJB> But your initial question doesn't actually make sense. You're not looking at the generated syntax trees or anything, so why do you care what PHP does with it "under the hood"?
[19:02:38] <omegatron> I am only takling about code readabilty, that's all
[19:03:05] <Rockwood> AllenJB, what is your qualifications?
[19:03:10] <Rockwood> don't mind
[19:03:13] <Rockwood> lol
[19:03:23] <Rockwood> happens
[19:03:39] <__adrian> your original question had nothing to do with readability - but, if you only care about readability, i'd think you'd find a comment more readable
[19:04:19] <__adrian> and while the choice is up to you, the idea that using vcs is "overhead" is silly
[19:04:26] <omegatron> but you don't need to know, I only asked about whether a "if ( false ) ..."  would end up in the resulting code, which I did not assumed, but the last time I checked PHP was at 5.x, so I don't know - but someone here might, that's why I asked "does someone KNOW FOR SURE..."
[19:05:30] <__adrian> omegatron: when you ask a question, people will want to know the context so they can give their best answers. this is appropriate. you can choose what you eventually decide to do, but you can't tell other people how to answer.
[19:06:00] <omegatron> vcs is overhead at this time .. next year, when our vcs server is set up and running, the code will be used with vcs, but NOT NOW (you don't know my circumstances, so ONLY answer the question, IF YOU CAN)
[19:06:15] <__adrian> if you don't want to give context, and get no answers you like as a result... that's because you chose not to give context.
[19:06:28] <biberu> vcs is overhead?
[19:06:31] <omegatron> no more context than the one I gave in my initial question was necessary
[19:06:31] <biberu> now i really want context
[19:06:38] <biberu> *scrolls back*
[19:07:06] <__adrian> omegatron: to be clear, you cannot tell other people how to answer. please be polite and cooperative if you want to participate here.
[19:07:11] <omegatron> this code i'm working on right now has to be working and running in the next days .. next year, it wil be too late - IT'S THAT SIMPLE

[19:17:06] <omegatron> Kate does change the color of comments ( which is good ), but it also introduces a line indentation ( which is not good ) - therefore I switched to a   "if ( 0 ) ..." - style, which is annoyting ( because now it has the same color as the other code ); and the reason why I asked myself, if this approach might also have the negative effect, this always false-statement might end up somehow in the executing code ( which I don't assume, but I don't
[19:17:06] <omegatron> know for sure, hence my question in this channel )
[19:17:44] <__adrian> "this always false-statement might end up somehow in the executing code"  it will never be executed.

[20:55:33] *** Quits: guenhael (Thunderbir@gateway/vpn/protonvpn/guenhael) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[20:55:34] <__adrian> but 202112 is not a valid datetime format
[20:55:39] <__adrian> *date/datetime
[20:56:04] <Sammitch> DATE_FORMAT()
[20:56:26] <__adrian> ^ if you want to format a date/datetime like that (but why would you)
[20:56:49] <FightingFalcon> because i have a postviews plugin and it stores monthly views like period: 202112
[20:57:19] <__adrian> not a great design decision  ;)
[20:57:59] <FightingFalcon> I know :D
[20:58:17] <bytestream> FightingFalcon, select concat(year(curdate()), month(curdate()))
[20:58:47] <FightingFalcon> yes, thanks, thats just how i did iit
[20:59:16] <__adrian> date_format() would mean you don't have to call currdate() twice
[20:59:32] <FightingFalcon> what do you mean?
[20:59:48] <__adrian> i mean, you would only need to call currdate() once
[21:00:17] <FightingFalcon> example?
[21:00:20] <bytestream> select date_format(curdate(), '%Y%m')
[21:00:45] <__adrian> it's also on the manual page i linked above  ;)
[21:01:23] <FightingFalcon> ok ok i get it

[21:36:36] <judah> My other gripe with it is the special characters are a bit of a pain to get to. Not that its any easier with qwerty

[21:40:12] <puff> Git is very useful and I highly recommend it.  Most of the headaches with git come from using it for multi-person projects, so using it for a single project is super easy.
[21:41:02] <puff> That is, it's *worth* the extra hassles if you're working on multi-user (er, multi-developer) project, but even for a single developer, it's very useful and most of those hassles don't apply.

[21:46:11] <Sammitch> I would also posit that if you think that "most of the headaches come from working on multi-dev projects" then you probably have a less-than-stellar workflow, eg: your project only ever has a single branch
[21:48:43] <judah> My headaches come from the other people on the project, not the tools we use to collaborate
[21:48:58] <judah> Except maybe for QA. Those are good people.
[21:52:33] <Sammitch> IMO everyone should be using a Feature Branch workflow at the least. Even if you're the only one working on the project it makes sense to separate your work so that you have the capability of working on more than one thing at a time without polluting/cross-pollinating the entire project dir.

[23:13:10] <Helenah> __adrian, I wish keyboards were universal. I don't mind multiple universal standards either so as long as I can stick whatever keys I want and where on a keyboard.
[23:13:27] <Helenah> I have a laptop and I refuse to put stickers on the keys.
[23:13:48] <__adrian> "universal" is pretty impractical
[23:14:19] <__adrian> though i wish i could find PBT caps (blank of not) for my current kb. (the one above i don't use anymore)

[23:15:54] <Helenah> __adrian, I like Cherry MX, keys can be replicated easily or one can find replications easily.
[23:16:04] <Helenah> blank keys are nice.
[23:16:32] <Albright> I've been using an X-Bows. Without a 10-key at first but I've got the 10-key one to use at work now. I'm fairly happy with it for the price and the software to remap keys and such (with the newer models) is non-Windows-compatible.
[23:16:56] <Albright> Er, I mean, it's compatible with non-Windows machines.
[23:17:26] <Albright> I don't care about blank keys. I don't need special keycaps to prove to myself I can touch-type. :P
[23:17:29] <Helenah> I thought all keyboards were compatible with non-Windows machines? New one to me.
[23:17:35] <Helenah> Also, 10 key?
[23:17:41] <__adrian> KBs that aren't compatible with _anything_ are idiotic
[23:17:50] <Albright> I mean the *software* is compatible with non-windows machines.
[23:18:03] <Helenah> Albright, What software?
[23:18:10] <Albright> The software to remap keys and such. You can use it without the software too of course.
[23:18:15] <Helenah> Oh.
[23:18:26] <Helenah> I thought that was an OS utility.
[23:18:37] <Albright> Helenah: It's called QMK.
[23:18:42] <Helenah> Weird...
[23:18:50] <__adrian> i have a g915 because last birthday, my wife misunderstood my appreciation to mean that i'd think it was okay to spend so much money on a keyboard
[23:18:50] <Albright> It tweaks the keyboard's firmware. Doesn't affect the OS.

[23:20:42] <__adrian> it flippin works
[23:20:44] <Albright> Especially for a gaming keyboard. Why introduce unnecessary latency? That seems odd.
[23:20:57] <Helenah> Albright, Agreed.
[23:22:06] <__adrian> well, the bluetooth doesn't. but the super-wireless-whatever is pretty remarkable. you could probably measure the latency, but not without tools i don't have. it's nothing like wireless KBs i've had in the past.

[23:54:09] <varrg> Can I implement my own RecursiveCallbackFilterIterator? I can't see how accept() works, does it call next()? when? at key(), valid() or current()?
[23:54:32] <varrg> I need to wrap RecursiveIteratorIterator with a RecursiveCallbackFilterIterator, but it only works the other way around
[23:55:52] <varrg> I need it in that order because my RecursiveIteratorIterator is constructing keys in key(), by concatenating all previous keys in the chain and I need to filter items from those. Thus I need the FilterIterator to be the outer most iterator, but it won't take a RecursiveIteratorIterator
[23:57:21] <judah> varrg, You have been talking about this problem for the past little bit. Could you share a pastebin of what you are trying to accomplish? I would love to help but there is some ambiguity in what I understand your dataset to look like
[23:57:41] <varrg> judah, yes. Here's a working code that should demonstrate my goal: https://3v4l.org/6ZI7M#v8.1.0
[23:57:53] <judah> perfect. give me a few
[23:58:17] <varrg> So, I tried using valid() to stop it from printing the current key (which is invalid), but returning false from valid() stops the entire iterator.

[23:59:13] <varrg> I reckon I can't bypass current() and key() and do the same check $this->invalid(), because I'd have to return NULL and it would still be present in the foreach then
