[11:29:53] <amazigh> hello
[11:30:42] <amazigh> I am trying to convert .md to .pdf; pandoc complains that the font is missing some chars
[11:31:05] <amazigh> so I added, a header to the markdown file specifying another font:
[11:31:14] <amazigh> % head scheme.rs.md
[11:31:16] <amazigh> ---
[11:31:18] <amazigh> mainfont: static/texgyrepagella-regular.otf
[11:31:53] <amazigh> The error is still here
[11:31:58] <amazigh> Missing character: There is no ‌ (U+200C) in font [lmmonolt10-bold]
[11:32:10] <amazigh> It mentions that is a mono font, I am wondering why
[11:32:42] <amazigh> There is the same message for a roman font which should be the default / main font
[11:34:22] <amazigh> [WARNING] Missing character: There is no ● (U+25CF) in font [lmroman10-regular]:mapping=tex-text;!
[11:34:25] <amazigh> [WARNING] Missing character: There is no ● (U+25CF) in font [lmroman10-regular]:mapping=tex-text;!

[12:46:49] <ede> amazigh: no idea how to define fonts, but did you check in a GUI if the other font has that specific one? the original one could still work as fallback else and still fail.

[12:49:44] <ede> wtf, i can type every hex character in hexchat to get a unicode point, but not C?
[12:51:32] *** Joins: carter (sid14827@helmsley.irccloud.com)
[12:55:13] <amazigh> No I did not check
[12:55:24] <amazigh> I assumed since the other font comes from a reputable World Wide Web site, it has the needed characters.
[12:55:30] <amazigh> Seems I was mistaken.
[12:55:56] <amazigh> Anyway, I dropped the .pdf output for the time being, and use just .html
[12:56:17] <amazigh> by the way pandoc consume something around ~10G of RAM when trying to produce the html
[12:59:05] <ede> from the web, so i suppose you're on windows?
[12:59:40] <ede> GNU Unifont and Noto are some fonts with a whole lot of Unicode codepoints available.
[13:00:18] <ede> also, Liberation
[13:01:29] <ede> you could check on one of the websites displaying whole unicode blocks at a time with a font of your choice (be aware that webfont loading in the background may happen)
[13:02:05] <ede> or with something like gucharmap
[14:40:31] <amazigh> I will look into Noto tx!
