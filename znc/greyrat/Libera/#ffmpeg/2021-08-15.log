[00:01:05] <edgy> JEEB: Wow!
[00:01:22] <edgy> JEEB: I just tried svt-av1 and it worked great
[00:03:50] <JEEB> SVT is by a company that intel acquired and they apparently had a framework for threading stuff (so I would expect it has more latency and memory usage, but it can go faster), on top of which they then put encoder code, such as libaom in case of AV1 I think
[00:04:28] <JEEB> youtube/google doesn't really require threading since they just split clips into bits and check at them around cpu-used 5 at the same time
[00:04:51] <JEEB> think of clips being split into ~2-10 second bits and being encoded at the same time
[00:05:21] <JEEB> (most large not-livestreaming sites do it like that)
[00:05:54] <JEEB> and you can see that libaom encoding is slow even for google since they apply it only on popular videos + it takes a (few )day(s) to get them
[00:06:04] <JEEB> them -> AV1 video
[00:07:06] <edgy> JEEB: then I would test both aom and svtav1 with a 2s video and check the result
[00:08:18] <edgy> JEEB: I don't see a crf option for svt in ffmpeg help
[00:08:42] <JEEB> yes, it's weird. there's a patch for it but I need to find time to rewrite it to work the same way as other encoders in libavcodec
[00:08:57] <JEEB> apparently the SVT devs originally didn't know it had a CRF mode, but then they found it out :D
[00:09:27] <JEEB> also to be honest, what CRF means is somewhat different between all encoders
[00:09:31] <JEEB> x264 is what had it originally
[00:09:39] <JEEB> constant rate factor
[00:10:24] <another|> I thought it referred to creamy ramen food

[00:11:51] <edgy> JEEB: by different you mean the scale but the concept is the same, right?
[00:12:14] <JEEB> not necessarily even the concept being the same other than it's something a bit more dynamic than constant quantizer
[00:12:49] <JEEB> x265 licensed x264's code, so they probably copied it from x264 so it at least started off similar?
[00:13:07] <JEEB> libvpx most likely conceptually with both vp8 and vp9 was different
[00:13:28] <JEEB> I would expect libaom be similar as it's an off-shoot of libvpx
[00:14:40] <JEEB> but really, there's no magic in this stuff so to figure out if you're getting better bang for buck from SVT-AV1 or libaom compared to x264, you need to basically match them up at the same resulting bit rate (each gets its parameters tweaked until the speed is similar and the output file size is very close)
[00:15:08] <JEEB> and then you should be able to compare if you are gaining much if anything from these encoders
[00:17:38] <edgy> JEEB: yes, though I would test the quality and size as far as the speed is not deadly slow, it's not a deciding factor, I really appreciate the detailed information and your patience. It's very rare to have such insight
[00:19:31] <JEEB> edgy: well the idea being, that if at your speed x264 makes you nice H.264 but the AV1 encoders don't really give you love, why utilize the newer stuff? :)
[00:20:04] <JEEB> I have use cases where I utilize x264 because it's a known stable encoder (visually etc), and because it's fast even at lolslow presets (veryslow and placebo)
[00:20:16] <JEEB> and due to compatibility, of course :)
[00:23:12] <edgy> JEEB: you are right. Will you be around after 10 mins? I will do some quick tests and tell you my findings
[00:23:47] <edgy> JEEB: there is also rav1e, this is all new to me
[00:24:55] <JEEB> yes, rav1e is the one I saw being over 2000fps or so when it first got rolling :) of course, it has gained complexity since ;)
[00:28:04] *** Quits: Blacker47 (~Blacker47@user/blacker47) (Quit: Life is short. Get a V.90 modem fast!)
[00:35:27] <edgy> JEEB: if you have large videos and you want to minimize the size while keeping the most of the quality, how would you proceed? I thought changing the format to av1 or 265 is the proper way. but now after your argument may be it's better to keep them x264 but change the bitrate or crf, what's the proper way to deal with this?
[00:37:03] <JEEB> if they're already "highly compressed", not doing anything is possibly the simplest answer. :P I mean, you're not going to do magic because you don't have the original source from which the lossy encode had been originally made
[00:39:37] <edgy> JEEB: let's say it's encoded in a higher quality than it needs to be. After all, human eye has limitations so not all the bitrate thrown on the video would be useful to me
[00:40:14] <JEEB> then it's all up to whether you can get a good enough result for your use case from whatever encoder
[00:44:09] <edgy> JEEB: exactly, so should I start with minimizing the bitrate or just use a higher crf and check?
[00:44:58] <JEEB> well, since you really don't seem to care about achieving an exact bit rate, choose a specific preset which is fast enough first with a say 90-120 second clip that is representative
[00:45:03] <JEEB> (2500 frames or so?)
[00:45:20] <JEEB> then after you have tweaked the preset to the slowest which fits your speed profile
[00:45:26] <JEEB> then you start with -crf 23
[00:45:31] <JEEB> and if it looks good, you go down
[00:45:39] <JEEB> asdf
[00:45:40] <JEEB> the other way
[00:45:47] <JEEB> if it looks good, you go up. if it looks bad, you go down
[00:46:03] <JEEB> thus you find with some tweaking the highest CRF value that still looks good to you for that preset
[00:46:10] <JEEB> and there you go
[00:46:34] <JEEB> you can then start rolling that over clips according to which the test clip was representative of (dark/light, frame rate, resolution)
[00:47:04] <JEEB> of course it's very possible that the highest CRF that still looks good to you ends up larger than the clip you already have
[00:47:06] <edgy> JEEB: when you say choose a specific preset which is fast enough, you mean like -preset fast? shouldn't this be used alongside crf?
[00:47:24] <JEEB> first you pick the preset, then within that preset the CRF
[00:48:17] <JEEB> there's plenty of presets starting from ultrafast (not for actual utilization since it skips way too much) to veryslow and placebo
[00:48:27] <JEEB> default is medium
[00:50:09] <edgy> JEEB: ok, so I will start with ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v libx264 -preset fast -crf 23 output.mp4. I assume there is no way to tell the current crf for the video, right?
[00:50:34] <JEEB> and that crf would be for that source version of the clip, anyways
[00:50:39] <JEEB> if the encoder utilized crf, of course
[00:50:59] <JEEB> and yes, if the speed level you want is with the fast preset
[00:51:44] <JEEB> that way you have already done the hard decision of how much time you want to utilize to compress in general, CRF is then just a lever within that to adjust which quantizer ranges are being utilized
[00:52:27] <edgy> JEEB: and when you say "2500 frames or so" you mean what we normally call video bitrate, right?
[00:52:37] <JEEB> no
[00:52:56] <JEEB> I first gave something in seconds (90-120) and then something in frames more or less in similar'ish ballpark
[00:53:08] <JEEB> (in some sets of frame rates)
[00:53:25] <edgy> JEEB: ah!

[14:35:16] <phisch> i have an audio file with an A52 and a DTS audio stream and i try to convert both audio streams to AAC with `-map 0 -c:a aac`. the A52 stream is converted properly, but the DTS one barely contains any audio, just some choppy bits of noises here and there. do you guys know where that issue could come from?

[15:10:15] <phisch> looks like the one that converts properly is a stereo stream, and the other one 3f2m/lfe (5.1) but i have no idea how to tell ffmpeg to properly auto detect what to convert the second one to :/
[15:12:13] <phisch> i guess it's an open bug... https://code.videolan.org/videolan/vlc/-/issues/21535

[20:19:11] <af> Hi, I'm trying to do scene detection on video from webcam however no frames are being output. The same command works for a video existing on disk: `ffmpeg -i /dev/video0 -filter_complex 'select=gt(scene\,0.1)' -vsync vfr 'f%03d.jpg'` - am I missing some flags or is there something limiting about v4l2 streams?
[20:23:54] <af> https://w.awalgarg.me/d/r4rBb5uch this is the output. Note that I tried to completely cover the camera lens with my thumb and remove it several times for over a minute or so. No frames were output after which I manually terminated it and it gave that response.

[20:36:54] <af> Also if I save the output as a matroska video and then run the same command on it, it works fine. Is there something I'm missing here as to how to make it work for a live video feed?

[21:37:22] <aphysically> now that I'm converting my streaming script to python I should look into the API.....I'm a bit partial to still using ffmpeg.c though
[21:41:41] <aphysically> does r_frame_rate always contain a /
[21:43:17] <aphysically> I was going to just eval() it but there's probably some idiotic way to stuff arbitrary code into r_frame_rate so I guess I should write a limited parser
[21:44:22] <JEEB> r_frame_rate as a variable is just an AVRational
[21:45:47] <aphysically> so ffprobe definitely won't output rm -rf ~?.....I'll just parse it anyway it's not that bad

[21:47:33] <furq> if you're using a real language then -of json
[21:48:23] <JEEB> I think he's already getting the string, but he just did the right decision of not doing eval() :P
[21:48:27] <JEEB> (on that string)
[21:49:02] <aphysically> I actually did that in bash already too (json output) - the text output was ultimately unparseable in general
[21:49:50] <aphysically> I had an enormous list of edge cases where it outputs extra spaces or junk and I eventually gave up and started parsing it with jq (but in python I'm using its native json parser obviously)
