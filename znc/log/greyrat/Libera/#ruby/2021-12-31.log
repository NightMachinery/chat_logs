[02:58:25] <weaksauce> which game John_Ivan 
[03:01:03] <John_Ivan> weaksauce, ever heard of puzzle pirates?
[03:01:19] <weaksauce> nope
[03:01:48] <John_Ivan> a small pirate rpg game, with a large persistent world, player driven economy and player ruled archipelagos.
[03:02:00] <weaksauce> fun
[03:02:17] <John_Ivan> weaksauce, activities (bilging, carpenting, blacksmithing, navigating, sailing, etc) are emulated through puzzles. the better you are at it, the better you're doing your job.
[03:02:43] <John_Ivan> Your profile also has a summarized CV-like screen which tells you your activities' experience and skill in them.
[03:03:05] <John_Ivan> weaksauce, the nice thing in the game is that you have ownership over ships, stalls/shops and/or other assets.
[03:03:15] <John_Ivan> weaksauce, the problem? I suck at puzzles. there's 20 of them.
[03:03:27] <John_Ivan> and every single one of them - I end up being miserable.
[03:03:29] <weaksauce> hah
[03:04:39] <John_Ivan> weaksauce, yeah. it's not easy to find 3x3x3x3 in the "bejeweled"-like game, that is, bilging (removing ship water through a pump) when you can barely find 3x3s...
[03:04:54] <John_Ivan> and that's just one aspect of a puzzle. they're all different.
[03:05:51] <John_Ivan> weaksauce, another puzzle is carpenting. it's an np-hard problem. you are given a hole and you must fit the pieces together to try not to overlap what you are carpenting on. this repairs the ship's hull.
[03:06:15] <John_Ivan> while I can achieve a "perfect" hole to cover with the pieces that randomly appear, I cannot do it more consistently than once.
[03:06:17] <weaksauce> sounds fun
[03:06:39] <John_Ivan> weaksauce, yeah. it's fun. the game overall is a genius concept. I just **really**. really suck. at puzzles.
[03:06:55] <John_Ivan> and yet here I am, playing the game. and trying to get better at them. the problem is, I never see progress xD
[03:07:30] <John_Ivan> weaksauce, https://yppedia.puzzlepirates.com/Carpentry
[03:07:36] <John_Ivan> yes, the game has a wiki

[04:41:23] <weaksauce> generally parens are omitted when there are no parameters

[05:09:32] <weaksauce> axisys_ it's shorthand for { foo: :bar } which is short for { :foo => :bar }
[05:10:33] <weaksauce> well in the function call it is a named parameter or a named catch all parameter but that's a bit different 
[05:11:32] <weaksauce> you could also just have Book.new(12, "title")
[05:12:01] <weaksauce> or depending on how it is defined Book.new(quantity: 12, title: "title")

[18:27:44] <havenwood> LACampbe1: CRuby startup should still be zippy... Benchmark it?
[18:28:04] <havenwood> hyperfine 'ruby --disable=gems -e "0"'
[18:28:49] <havenwood> LACampbe1: I'm seeing a nice little improvement. I'm curious why you aren't.
[18:31:18] <havenwood> gproto23: Implement any method? Hem, depending on how I read that it seems either sprawling and impossible or just to know Ruby.
[18:32:21] <leftylink> I use Enumerable when implementing certain methods, but not all of them
[18:32:23] <havenwood> gproto23: Minitest::Assertions you mean? Say more about your `assert` question?
[18:35:58] <gproto23> havenwood: e.g each_index method how can i get information about it, its use case etc.
[18:37:51] <leftylink> pandabot rb [:gproto, [].method(:each_index).owner]
[18:37:52] <pandabot> [:gproto, Array] - https://carc.in/#/r/cj6p
[18:38:06] <leftylink> therefore you know where each_index comes from.
[18:39:38] <gproto23> leftylink: this is confusing for me. i do not understand it
[18:40:03] <leftylink> you may do the same to find out where any method comes from.
[18:40:18] <leftylink> that is the question you asked.
[18:40:40] <leftylink> then perhaps seeing that it comes from array you will look up https://ruby-doc.org/core-3.0.2/Array.html
[18:41:11] <leftylink> thereby you get information about it, which is also the question you asked
[18:45:12] <havenwood> gproto23: You can use `ri` from the command line, like: ri each_index
[18:45:29] <havenwood> gproto23: Or in Ruby, you can: foo.method(:each_index).owner
[18:45:47] <havenwood> gproto23: And if the method isn't implemented in C: foo.method(:each_index).source_location

[21:50:43] <cahoots_> hi, i want to run Process.spawn(...) but direct stdout to multiple outputs (one being a file, the other being normal stdout). how might i do this? (and i can't just add "| tee file" to the end, because for various reasons i need Process.spawn to spawn the process directly and not a shell)
