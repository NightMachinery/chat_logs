[17:09:55] <Demosthenex> well that's common lisp, which is external to emacs.
[17:10:02] <afidegnum> ok
[17:10:28] <Demosthenex> gotta tell ya, i learned TONS of programming languages over the years, and i regret not picking up lisp first
[17:10:43] <Demosthenex> and CL is really powerful
[17:10:44] <afidegnum> that's also my regret :) 
[17:10:59] <Demosthenex> emacs+slime and CL is an amazing way to code
[17:11:25] <afidegnum> I started with Java in 2002, later php in 2004, python in 2010 ... 
[17:11:52] <Demosthenex> but org isn't for coding, it's not a programming language, it's a document markup. some people do literate programming in it, meaning they document everything and then make code blocks they tangle out into source files, but the code itself isn't executable in org
[17:11:54] <afidegnum> the issue is, I had no one to guide me on lisp 
[17:12:34] <Demosthenex> ah. yeah i started on basic in the 80's, pascal, c, c++, assembly 80286 in the 90's, perl, python, tcl, shell, etc later. it wasn't til like 2010 i studied lisp
[17:12:57] <afidegnum> some painful regrets :( )
[17:13:13] <Demosthenex> so, practical common lisp is a great book, that's what i self studied
[17:13:54] <afidegnum> I will need to go back to CL again. 
[17:14:15] <afidegnum> what pushed me away from it was McClim which seems complicated to me 
[17:14:46] <afidegnum> i was interested in building GUI framework with less learning curve, 
[17:15:11] <Demosthenex> ah
[17:15:16] <Demosthenex> so i HATE uis.
[17:15:20] <Demosthenex> i'm a backend guy
[17:15:41] <afidegnum> at a point, you might need some forms, prompts etc.. 
[17:16:32] <Demosthenex> yep. i agree
[17:16:54] <Demosthenex> i've been seeking a decent TUI library, maybe a turbovision replacement for years
[17:17:22] <afidegnum> yes
[17:17:28] <Demosthenex> basically, if i can't do it in a terminal over ssh, forget it
[17:18:21] <Demosthenex> and i loathe webapps with every fiber of my being
[17:18:24] <afidegnum> there are some complexities terminals are not able to handle
[17:18:36] <Demosthenex> as far as i'm concerned, the web is a giant radioactive dumpster fire

[17:19:06] <afidegnum> clients need them badly :)
[17:20:37] <afidegnum> i have done something like this : https://sites.google.com/site/sabraonthehill/postmodern-examples/postmodern-intro-to-s-sql but it was in python
[17:20:46] <Demosthenex> yeah, i'm only 40 and i'm already a greybeard shouting at webdevs to get off my lawn
[17:21:27] <Demosthenex> i'm going to break the hands of the next webdev who makes their site blinding white and full of whitespace, and disabled hotkey remapping forcing me to use the crayola copy/paste commands.
[17:21:30] <afidegnum> i'm also 40, I just want to set up a sustainable project so i can retire, 
[17:21:46] <Demosthenex> DAO's, sql wrappers, are common in every language.
[17:21:57] <Demosthenex> but being able to express sql via LISP is unique
[17:22:24] <afidegnum> yes, 
[17:22:39] <Demosthenex> because of how you can manipulate and compose lisp code, it's unique.
[17:23:28] <afidegnum> most my utiliites are built in lisp/elisp, making work easy for me, 
[17:23:58] <Demosthenex> yep
[17:24:03] <Demosthenex> emacs is a godsend
[17:24:42] <afidegnum> the so-called IDEs misled us 
[17:24:53] <Demosthenex> and don't mind me being grumpy too much. i've got decades of resentment that programmers made gui's to dumb down computing for users, and then get lectured by users how easy computing is.
