[05:47:40] <bailsman> You're not worried about giving all jenkins jobs root access then?

[05:48:10] <aeon_flux> i'm confused what you mean by that
[05:48:53] <aeon_flux> why does it mean jenkins jobs run as root? because the docker daemon is running as root?
[05:48:55] <bailsman> Anyone that can log in to jenkins and can control what job runs (directly or in directly) can then talk to the docker daemon and ask for root, and receive it, no?
[05:50:02] <bailsman> And you can trivially get a root shell on the host by talking to the docker daemon

[05:51:04] <bailsman> Currently I'm running builtkid rootless in another container and using buildctl to build containers
[05:51:12] <bailsman> previously I've used bazel to build containers where that made sense
[05:51:56] <aeon_flux> all i want jenkins to do is run a docker-compose file in a repo haha
[05:52:01] <aeon_flux> this is incredibly frustrating
[05:52:28] <bailsman> You have a usecase where it does not matter so much that any jenkins job can trivially obtain root on the host and bypass any and all access controls?
[05:52:55] <aeon_flux> why do you keep saying that haha
[05:53:04] <aeon_flux> are you saying that having an exposed docker daemon means anyone can connect and get root?
[05:53:12] <bailsman> Yes
[05:53:18] <aeon_flux> like... what's the point of even having a docker daemon if that's the case

[05:57:23] <bailsman> Maybe I've been overcomplicating things - I didn't realize people were just forwarding the docker socket.
[05:58:20] <aeon_flux> ugh. the articles i'm reading all use that open socket
[05:58:21] <aeon_flux> i'll check youtube
[05:58:44] <bailsman> Isn't anyone worried that a job can get root access on the host? Why are all the tutorials saying that
[05:58:45] <aeon_flux> you can also add ssh creds

[06:03:04] <aeon_flux> okay that video was trash lol
[06:03:11] <bailsman> aeon_flux: oh hold on, you've got jenkins running in docker on one vm, and you're forwarding a *second* docker daemon running on a different, isolated vm?
[06:03:19] <aeon_flux> correct!
[06:03:20] <bailsman> is that why you're not worried about the job getting root on that 2nd vm?
[06:03:47] <aeon_flux> the problem is, the docker plugins, (there are like 15 of them), can build the image, but i can't get it to run in a container. i get a weird error.

[06:04:46] <aeon_flux> but then i get a health check error when it goes onto the next build stage which is to run docker compose
[06:05:20] <bailsman> Why go through the trouble of forwarding daemon sockets and whatnot? Just have your job ssh into the second machine and run `docker-compose build`
[06:06:01] <bailsman> run a slave on the second machine I mean, I guess. because you'd want the repo to be cloned there
[06:06:03] <aeon_flux> yeah, i could do that. i just wanted to use the built in tools. i didn't just want jenkins to be a dumb shell script runner

[06:07:19] <aeon_flux> there is no slave. it's just a docker socket config in one of the plugins.
[06:07:25] <aeon_flux> i don't have any slaves, i haven't explored jenkins that much yet.
[06:07:47] <bailsman> the slave would run outside of docker and have access to the regular docker socket

[06:27:02] <tabakhase> the trick is to make that "host" just as disposable ;-)
[06:28:17] <tabakhase> gitlab-ci is a good example, its all dind, but on a openstack baselayer with maxbuilds=1 so the whole thing goes up in flames after a build

[06:32:29] <tabakhase> but when you can "trust" a little more - say company internal and you want todo parallel builds on the runner and such getting that rooted normally isnt rly a "risk" - you may end up with "a runner per project" or such to get some separation, but there KVM&co can jump in to give you that extra layer
