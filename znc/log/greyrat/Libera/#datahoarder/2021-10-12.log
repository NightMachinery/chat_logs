[22:33:57] <danderson> skye0_mobile: thankfully, at least for chia's economics, tape doesn't seem to work. Checking if you have a hash would take minutes/hours to reel/unreel tapes, and each time you do you're wearing out the tape. It's just not designed for a ton of repeated access.

[22:47:29] <danderson> and up to 5min or so if a different tape is needed
[22:47:32] <rmmh> right, and chia needs *several* sequential accesses
[22:47:43] <rmmh> (er, several random accesses in sequence)
[22:48:18] <danderson> yeah, so, hopefully, tape is structurally incapable of participating in the ponzi scheme
[22:48:41] <danderson> doesn't make it _much_ cheaper, given there's now only 1 manufacturer of tape drives, 2 of tapes, and ~3 of libraries...
[22:48:41] <rmmh> warmwaffles: on the bright side it's barely grown in the last few months, largely because of the pathetic economic prospectus https://www.chiaexplorer.com/charts/netspace?period=6m

[22:49:03] <sarnold> why mine someone else's pyramid scheme when you can build your own pyramid?
[22:49:14] <rmmh> dedicating 100TB of storage to chia has an expected return of like $100/mo
[22:49:28] <danderson> or do what ethereum does, and build a pyramid factory
[22:49:32] <rmmh> which is something like 2 or 3 years to break even
[22:49:42] <danderson> then you get to charge a tax on every new pyramid being built! It's brilliant.

[22:50:45] <warmwaffles> I want to get in to tape, but holy christ it's expensive to do LTO6 or LTO7. Just waiting for used drives to hit the market end of year
[22:50:57] <warmwaffles> *insert OP skeleton waiting*

[22:51:37] <danderson> still waiting on SAS cables and tapes to test it, but the autoloader is almost exactly 5 years old - thrown out right at the end of the depreciation schedule
[22:53:30] <rmmh> there's a company that makes a lightning LTO drive
[22:53:42] <warmwaffles> Yea the thing is, I have to plan out how it's going to run / where it is going to sit
[22:53:43] <rmmh> err, thunderbolt
[22:53:46] <danderson> rmmh: for $4-5k you can get a 16-slot LTO-8 library from the right sources, if you're okay with Quantum ("budget" LTO compared to HPE and IBM)

[22:55:38] <danderson> That's not the one I got :) But if I had $5k to blow, I would definitely get one of those. Fully loaded with LTO tapes it'll do 192TB without operator intervention
[22:56:12] <danderson> Note the non-native capacity numbers are lies for LTO :)
[22:56:21] <danderson> they assume a 2.5:1 compression ratio
[22:56:28] <rmmh> oh, right. they assume you're archiving petabytes of text, as you do
[22:56:53] <danderson> but LTO-8 doesn't really need that much help, 12TB per tape will absolutely do
[22:56:56] <rmmh> maybe there are dummies with 500TB oracle databases they archive to tape that get 2.5:1 compression
[22:57:19] <danderson> Stuff like VM images probably also compress decently. Really everything except video
[22:57:30] <danderson> which is ironic given the number of youtubers who are getting into tape for project archival :)
[22:59:18] <danderson> but on ebay at least, the sweet spot atm is LTO5/6, 1.5T and 2.5T per tape

[23:00:03] <danderson> not great, not terrible. And the trick is to look for libraries where the tape drive isn't easily separable from the autoloader, afaict resellers list those at roughly the price of the autoloader robot, not the price of the tape drive inside it
[23:00:42] <danderson> So instead of $3k for a naked LTO6 drive, it's $1k for a basic autoloader... with a builtin LTO6 drive.
[23:10:38] <warmwaffles> danderson, that's hot
[23:11:00] <warmwaffles> I'd love to backup my entire 100TB setup on a monthly basis :D
[23:11:59] <danderson> yeah. Tapes aren't _super_ cheap still, you're still paying $10/TB or so
[23:12:31] <danderson> and LTO only gets ~150-200 full scans of the tape (read OR write) before they degrade, so you have to be a bit careful in planning your backup schedule
[23:13:03] <warmwaffles> Yea, mainly I want a disaster recovery plan. Where I make a backup quarterly and rotate it out of a safe place
[23:15:24] <danderson> Same, that's my plan. I have 75TB of tapes showing up this week. One full backup every 6-12mo or so, rotated offsite. Onsite has a full backup + differentials.
[23:16:00] <danderson> So, if I lose spinning rust, at worse a couple days of data loss from what didn't make it into a differential yet. If the house burns down, at worst 6-12mo dataloss for the "bulk" hoarded data
[23:16:29] <danderson> But that stuff doesn't grow *that* fast, so rescuing the bulk of it is still a big deal
[23:16:41] <danderson> and if I get paranoid, I can do a monthly incremental and ship that tape offsite as well or something
[23:20:16] <warmwaffles> How are you doing differentials? I was thinking literally just `cp -R` into the drives
[23:20:29] <warmwaffles> or are you just dumping borg backups into it
[23:20:57] <danderson> Not decided yet, I'm sacrificing the first few tapes to figuring that out.
[23:21:18] <rmmh> are borg/attic/restic suitable for tape at all?
[23:21:34] <danderson> The "classic" way to manage tape is either Bacula or Bareos, they handle all the "grab the data, move it across the network, write to tape, maintain a file->tape+offset database" stuff
[23:22:10] <danderson> They also handle automated full/incremental/differential backup schedules, and know how to work an autoloader and ask you to swap tape magazines when the autoloader is full
[23:22:37] <warmwaffles> LTFS I think is the filesystem that takes care of that right?
[23:22:38] <danderson> more basic is "take any large file and write it to the tape through mbuffer"
[23:23:00] <danderson> LTFS is optional, but yeah, if you want a "classic" filesystem view of the tape, LTFS does that
[23:23:28] <danderson> it's somewhat limited though: deleting files doesn't recover any space, it just marks that extent of tape as "deleted" but can't reuse it until you wipe the entire tape
[23:23:36] <warmwaffles> I should just get a cheap lto system and play with it
[23:23:39] <danderson> and it's pretending that tape can do random access, so... Any access is slow
[23:23:44] <warmwaffles> like LTO4 or something small
[23:23:55] <danderson> LTO4 doesn't do LTFS, be careful :)
[23:23:59] <danderson> LTFS is LTO5+
[23:23:59] <warmwaffles> ugh
[23:24:15] <danderson> But honestly, for a large data volume, LTFS doesn't make much sense IMO
[23:24:37] <danderson> it's nice if you want to get a desk-top tape drive and treat it like a chonky zip drive
[23:25:01] <danderson> But for really large amounts of data, a backup manager like Bacula is the way to go, IMO
[23:25:17] <warmwaffles> I haven't messed with bacula, only borg 
[23:25:32] <danderson> something designed for tape, and that knows how to play to the strengths of tape (basically: stream large contiguous files onto the tape, and record byte offsets for each file so you can seek+read efficiently)
[23:26:14] <danderson> Bacula is from the older generation of backup software, it's much less smart. Doesn't really do deduplication or anything, if a file changes the entire changed file gets backed up again.
[23:26:20] <warmwaffles> The other thing is, I need another long term store that my wife / kids can access easily without my retarded gooey brain to get pictures and stuff off of
[23:26:57] <danderson> Some commercial tape library software can do "deduplication", but it's really not playing to tape's strength if trying to read one file translates to "ok I need 5 blocks from tape A, 15 blocks from tape B. ///A
[23:27:07] <warmwaffles> I've got an external drive I have mounted that is exfat that I just have all the crap copied into it
[23:27:18] <danderson> oh yeah, if ease of access is a big deal, LTFS is the way to go
[23:27:20] <warmwaffles> that is labeled "in case things go terrible"
[23:27:45] <danderson> Then the instructions can be "buy a magstor tape drive of the correct generation, plug it into a mac, insert tape, receive files"
[23:28:28] <danderson> Systems like Bacula need software infrastructure in place to read the tapes back. Basically there's a central database of which files live on which tapes, and you _must_ have that database to restore files
[23:28:40] <warmwaffles> Although I think the critical shit I have can live in sub 4TB right now

[23:28:53] <danderson> well, not _must_ must. There's a disaster recovery process where you can feed bacula every single tape you have, and it'll reconstruct the index from that
[23:29:21] <danderson> but that'll take a while, and you still have to do that before you can tell it "okay restore precious photos at timestamp X"
[23:29:54] <danderson> The strength of something like bacula is scalability. You can back up hundreds of systems to dozens of different disk and tape locations, and a restore is just "here's the files I want, put them over here"
[23:30:21] <danderson> and bacula then goes "okay cool, I'll need the following 5 tapes with barcodes 1,2,3,4,5, load those into tape library A and I'll get to work"
[23:31:06] <danderson> If a full backup doesn't span more than 1-2 tapes, you can manage it by hand with LTFS
[23:31:34] <danderson> In my case I'm being greedy, I want to back up _everything_. I don't want to have to decide what's precious :)
[23:32:03] <warmwaffles> same. I've got tons of ISOs I would like to keep in case BTRFS decides to poop all over me

[23:32:21] <danderson> I have a small dataset that I *know* is precious, and that goes to N+2 disks plus cloud backups. But then there's 30TB of crap that's "probably not super precious, but I'll kick myself if I realize in 5 years I really needed one of those files"
[23:32:25] <warmwaffles> Been 5 years, no poop for a raid 6 :D

[23:32:51] <rmmh> danderson: bacula is probably fine for my purposes, where the bulk of my data is from large media files
[23:32:54] <rmmh> that don't change
[23:33:04] <danderson> So my plan is to yeet all of it, thousands of files and dozens of terabytes, onto tape. A full backup will be 12 LTO6 tapes, which fits nicely in a pelican case for storage
[23:33:17] *** Joins: tech_exorcist (txrcst@user/tech-exorcist/x-0447479)
[23:33:33] <danderson> But 12 tapes per full backup, plus extra tapes for incrementals/differentials... Starts to become hard to track which files live where
[23:33:36] <warmwaffles> do a write up of your solution. I'd be interested in seeing it
[23:33:46] <danderson> that's where Bacula shines. I tell it what files I want, it tells me which tapes to fetch and load up
[23:34:00] <rmmh> couldn't you dump the bacula DB to the end of each tape?\
[23:34:06] <danderson> rmmh: yeah, same. Tape is *great* for large volumes of WORM data
[23:34:29] <danderson> That's why it's so popular for "archival" storage, where tape is the only copy of data

[23:34:55] <danderson> take all the big data you *probably* never need again, yeet it onto tapes, put them in a vault. 5 years later, realize you were wrong and you needed that data, just pull it back off the tape :)
[23:35:03] <ThePendulum> tapeworm?
[23:35:30] <danderson> rmmh: bacula has some mechanisms for backing up its own database, but I haven't looked at it in detail
[23:35:40] <rmmh> I'd almost be tempted to rewrite backula for my purposes, since it's so simple...
[23:35:56] <danderson> their recommendation is basically: the DB is small enough to back up to spinning rust, so just do that and keep lots and lots of copies, so you never have to worry about losing it
[23:36:09] <rmmh> sure-- rust, cloud, whatever
[23:36:26] <rmmh> does that metadata DB handle the entire FS structure / deletions ,too ?
[23:36:46] <danderson> Very worst case if you lose all of them, you can reconstruct the DB by scanning in the manifests of every tape you have, so very worst case, it's a couple days/weeks of annoying "load a bunch of tapes and let bacula reconstruct its index"
[23:37:31] <danderson> yeah, its index should handle all that. It's designed for really traditional "back up and restore entire filesystems" workflows
[23:37:58] <danderson> So once you've set up your schedule of full/incremental/differential, the restore operation is just which files, at which timestamp
[23:38:30] <danderson> And same, it's tempting to rewrite bacula. Bacula is very enterprisey, and not really well suited for the tiny scale of hobbyists
[23:39:17] <danderson> It's designed so you can have hundreds of "file daemons" (sources of data to back up), hundreds of "storage daemons" (disks and tape libraries where backups live), and an operator that's basically running your backups machine room
[23:39:34] <danderson> It's a bit overkill for "all my data's on my NAS, please just back up my NAS to tape thx"
[23:40:30] <danderson> But tape is not super popular, so the only solutions that exist are either "figure it out yourself with LTFS" or turbo-enterprise megasystems

[23:52:26] <danderson> warmwaffles: and yes, once I figure out wtf I'm doing, I'll write it up :)
[23:53:30] <warmwaffles> yea you seem to have WAY more knowledge than I do on this right now but that's probably because you are about to embark into it
[23:54:39] <danderson> yeah, I've been lusting after tape for stupid reasons for years (basically: I *love* tape robots, even though it's impractical for my actual needs, I want one), and did a bunch more research before buying. But no practical experience yet, hopefully later this week when the SAS cable and tapes show up
[23:55:02] <cirdan> danderson: it was rewritten, bareos :)
[23:55:17] <cirdan> i have 4 tape libraries, i need to sell 3 of them
[23:55:31] <cirdan> i need to sell a lot of things actucally
[23:55:40] <danderson> forked, rather than rewritten. Both Bacula and Bareos are on my list to test out. Bareos is annoying right now because NixOS doesn't have a recent build of it, been working on getting an updated version in
[23:55:54] <danderson> cirdan: so you use bareos? Any tasting notes?
[23:56:21] <cirdan> It’s complicated
[23:56:30] <cirdan> I have so much data I can’t decide how to back it up
[23:56:36] <cirdan> But I’ve done one offs
[23:57:53] <danderson> So what do you primarily do these days? I also want to explore various options, but if you've liked some more than others...
[23:58:30] <cirdan> I mostly don’t have things backed up even though I should
[23:58:35] <danderson> mood
[23:58:46] <cirdan> Zfs snapshots and raid have helped me
[23:59:10] <danderson> That's part of what I'm optimizing for: something that's self-driving once I've set it up, so I can let ADHD run wild and only have to react to "yo, eject left mag and gimme fresh tapes"
[23:59:42] <danderson> yeah same, with ZFS snapshotting and raidz2 I'm less stressed about actual real backups than I should have been
