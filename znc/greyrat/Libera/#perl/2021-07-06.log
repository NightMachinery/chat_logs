[00:00:10] <Grinnz> Parallel::Map as mentioned provides a pmap_concat, which is essentially a IO::Async::Function combined with fmap_concat

[00:00:40] <Bossi> splitting is just reading input and when there is the "blockseparator", mostly an empty line, it forms a datablock, while the splitter also has some kind of configuration rules what to ignore on input
[00:00:42] *** Joins: jetchisel (jetchisel@user/jetchisel)
[00:01:09] <Grinnz> what does the input come from? file or socket?
[00:01:12] <Grinnz> or database?
[00:01:30] <Bossi> file descriptor
[00:01:34] <LeoNerd> It doesn't sound very CPU-intensive
[00:02:27] <Grinnz> you can either split them upfront into an array of things to process, or use fmap_concat's generate option to split them as it processes
[00:02:50] <Bossi> the input splitter should not be the performance issue at all

[00:07:08] <Bossi> so i have a "splitter" which has a method "next_block" which returns the current input line counter, a array ref for a data block and a array ref for meta-data
[00:09:04] <Bossi> while the handle_block for analysing the data block, gets a block-counter, a datablock array-ref and a meta-data array ref
[00:12:46] <ehuelsmann[m]> I think you should be able quite easily build this as a generator, which would throttle the input based on the ability of the remainder of the pipeline to process the blocks.

[18:17:05] <leitz> Morning all.
[18:17:25] <leitz> Is there a config option for module-starter to use semver when writing new modules?
[18:19:05] *** Joins: gryphn (~gryphon@84.17.45.6)
[18:20:47] <simcop2387> leitz: i don't think so, but i've not used it.  semver doesn't always play nicely with versions in perl for a few stupid historical reasons but it can be done
[18:21:10] <simcop2387> Grinnz: you're the current maintainer so you might know better than me on that front
[18:21:57] <leitz> simcop2387, thanks. I'm working on my module now, which is giving me a lot of questions about the process that I'll need to figure out as I press on.
[18:24:12] <simcop2387> yea, at the worst you can just manually set it of course, but one thing to keep in mind is that semver in perl will end up actually working like this: $semver="v1.2.3"; $perlversion="v1.002003";  meaning that perl version parsing and comparing modules will work with it like the $perlversion even though you specified it as v1.2.3.  which can catch you off guard if you aren't expecting it.
[18:24:38] <simcop2387> that's because of the way perl (the interpreter) versions used to work so everything else followed that, and it all predates semver
[18:25:26] <simcop2387> but that also means that semver-like comparisons aren't really all that workable as far as listing requirements generally goes, but the human side of things will work fine at least
[18:26:20] <leitz> Well, that's pretty odd. Perl uses three digits for its own version...

[18:26:51] <perlbot> simcop2387: 5.034000

[18:27:06] <perlbot> simcop2387: 5.008008
[18:27:32] <leitz> So it keeps a three digit number for minor and tiny versions?
[18:27:39] <simcop2387> pretty much
[18:27:55] <simcop2387> eval: $^V
[18:27:56] <perlbot> simcop2387: bless( {original => "v5.34.0",qv => 1,version => [5,34,0]}, 'version' )
[18:28:15] <leitz> Okay. My main reason is that I expect to have to do a lot of work on my modules, so multiple version numbers will help.  :)
[18:28:52] <simcop2387> there's a new version object bit that works the way you'd logically think about them but the old style still exists and has compatibility maintained and it's caused things in the perl ecosystem to generally think about things with the combined number.

[19:08:11] <treefrob> does anyone have experience using Perl to (semi-)automatically generate a document in an editable form?
[19:08:28] <leitz> Okay, I'm back to being confused. These lines used to make the book object, before I started on the modularization.  https://github.com/LeamHall/book_collate/blob/new_report_writer/demo/test_book_collate.pl#L108-L117
[19:08:29] <Paperbot> Link title(s): [ book_collate/test_book_collate.pl at new_report_writer · LeamHall/book_collate · GitHub ]
[19:08:54] <leitz> Not I get   In the demo, the book title is Book::Collate::Book=HASH(0x562a90edacf0)->title().
[19:09:06] <leitz> Not/Now
[19:09:16] <treefrob> +it?
[19:10:17] <curdlesnoot> leitz: within the double quotes, only "$book" is being expanded, as opposed to the title() method.
[19:10:26] <leitz> treefrob, not sure what I'm working on meets what you're looking for. My project takes text files and collates them into a larger text file.
[19:10:35] <curdlesnoot> you can see that's hinted at by what's printed.
[19:11:13] <haarg> you can't make method calls when interpolating in a string. at least, not directly
[19:11:31] <haarg> print "In the demo, the book title is " . $book->title() . ".\n";
[19:12:20] <leitz> Cool, that works. Now to phrase the deeper problem well. Gimme a minute.
[19:13:07] <treefrob> I'd like to use Perl to generate, for example, an ODT document using pre-defined chunks of text and image files
[19:13:31] <treefrob> such that someone could open and edit the document using LibreOffice, or (barf) even Word
[19:14:40] <leitz> treefrob, mine currently generates text, but I'm working towards LaTeX and HTML output. No reason it can't do ODT, eventurally.
[19:15:10] <leitz> I open the end file in LibreOffice and munge it a little, before saving it as a docx. 
[19:15:40] <treefrob> RTF might also be an option -- I haven't looked at it in a while

[22:18:13] <JasonNYC> Hi there
[22:18:35] <leitz> mjgardner, I updated the PrePan URL and comments.
[22:19:30] <Grinnz> leitz: '0.0.01' doesn't make sense as a version. if you're using semantic versioning, each segment is an integer, so should not have leading zeroes
[22:19:37] <JasonNYC> Is there a way to delete a file using a filehandle? I need to be able to delete a file while I have a LOCK_EX on it because if I close it and then call unlink, another process might open it between my close and unlink and I would delete its new file
[22:21:26] <leitz> Grinnz, thanks! That's the sort of critique I'm looking for first; on the module build parts. I'll start a branch and work the changes.   :)
[22:22:03] <Grinnz> our $VERSION = 'v0.0.1'; # ideally
[22:22:26] <Grinnz> the leading v prevents it from changing version variety if you accidentally release a version with only two segments
[22:23:18] <leitz> Cool.
[22:23:20] <nirnam> JasonNYC: I don't there is, tell me if I'm wrong but filehandle just filedescriptor with extra steps, I don't think you can delete a file in which that filehandle coming from
[22:23:59] <treefrob> which is better maintained/easier to use: OpenOffice::OODoc or ODF::lpOD?
[22:24:47] <Grinnz> JasonNYC: nope, unlink requires a file path
[22:25:14] <Grinnz> it's unlinking it from the filesystem, not the file descriptor
[22:26:19] *** Joins: randir (~randir@95-25-192-120.broadband.corbina.ru)
[22:26:33] <JasonNYC> Ok. thank you. So what would be a workaround to make sure I don't delete that file if it was open by another process? I suppose rename is the same thing, or can I rename while it's LOCK_EX?
[22:26:35] <Bossi> the file descriptor will still be open, you just remove the reference to the inode in the filesystem, the inode gets deleted after the last filehandle is closed using it
[22:27:33] <leitz> Grinnz, funny for the day. Fixing the version breaks Manifest.SKIP, which looks for a \d after the module name.  ;)
[22:28:10] <JasonNYC> For example, I still have LOCK_EX, I rename to something random, then I close. Now I can unlink that new name safely because another process wouldn't use that file name?
[22:29:00] <Grinnz> leitz: no reason to check for anything after the module name - ^Book-Collate- is enough
[22:29:15] <Grinnz> similarly for .gitignore: Book-Collate-*

[22:31:17] <Bossi> JasonNYC: the flock is just advisory, even the file can be changed by some other process which does not use flock: "This means that programs that do not also use "flock" may modify files locked with "flock"."
[22:32:05] <JasonNYC> sure, but none will in my case. All processes use flock
[22:33:21] <Bossi> i dont see a problem to rename the file while you have the lock then, since it wont bother the file descriptor, you only change the "name" pointing to the opened inode
[22:33:30] <JasonNYC> I guess the question then comes down to: Can we safely call rename() on a file that is in LOCK_EX without issues?
[22:34:03] <Bossi> the flock does not know about a "name"
[22:34:23] <JasonNYC> hmmm, so the system (as it relates to the filehandle) doesn't actually care that the name has changed? It's still the same handle, just at a different name on the disk?

[22:36:07] <Bossi> the data gets removed from the file system then when all references to the inode are removed and every filedescriptors are closed
[22:36:09] <JasonNYC> ok that's awesome. I'll just rename while locked then, and then delete after that rename, that should make it very safe in case another process is trying to open it in the same time

[22:37:33] <JasonNYC> So a filehandle is really just a handle on some address then, it's independent from the name or "location" (path) on the disk?
[22:37:58] <Grinnz> yep
[22:38:03] <Grinnz> or more precisely
[22:38:18] <Grinnz> the file's data on disk is independent from the filesystem path which points to it
[22:38:43] <Grinnz> file paths are basically scalar refs
[22:41:48] <JasonNYC> I see :)  Thank you!
[22:43:41] <Grinnz> this is also why deleted files actually still exist most of the time until the filesystem decides to reuse that space

[22:59:13] <leitz> I've added the "issues" to Book::Collate that I know of. If you see anything else then please let me know here or just make an issue. I'm overdue for a nap.

[23:02:12] <Grinnz> META.json and META.yml should not be in your MANIFEST; these are generated by make dist, which also adds their entries to MANIFEST in the dist
[23:02:52] <Grinnz> er, ./Build dist in your cast

[23:54:31] <cornett> LeoNerd: will a single statement form of defer be possible?  That is, defer $dbh->disconnect; instead of defer { $dbh->disconnect; }
[23:55:03] <cornett> I assume that most uses of defer will be single statements
[23:55:30] <cornett> and yes I'm lazy ;)
[23:55:46] <LeoNerd> Not currently.., I don't see much point in such
[23:55:57] <LeoNerd> you can just put { }s around it
[23:56:34] <cornett> functionally, no point.  But visually, I could do without the block
[23:56:48] <cornett> just a comment
[23:56:57] <lopid> agree
[23:57:02] <lopid> it was indeed just a comment

[23:57:52] <Grinnz> the benefit of a defer-expression form would be more the ability to do "defer stuff() if $foo;"
[23:58:11] <Grinnz> but you kinda still need a block to notate what part you're deferring
[23:58:40] <cornett> yes
[23:59:42] <LeoNerd> Visually it's nice to put the deferred code inside a block. The braces remind you it's not part of the current code flow
