[06:42:10] <twb> is there really any difference between doom and quake
[06:42:19] <aidalgol> Probably because they've learned from the last two decades of game design.

[06:42:54] <aidalgol> I've played a bit of it, but it's boring.

[06:45:33] <twb> in Marathon 1 you get missions from the ship AI which is slowly being hacked by aliens so goes batshit
[06:45:40] <aidalgol> I've had it up to my eyeballs with roguelikes.
[06:45:53] <twb> so like halfway thruogh the AI is like "actually I've changed my mind, the next mission is to walk out this airlock without a suit"

[07:05:39] <technomancy> I had played the opengl version but it still used the original textures

[07:07:49] <technomancy> doom has more in common with descent than it does with actually being infantry

[09:38:23] <twb> Let's do a fan mode of Mega Man X that replaces all animal bosses with Australian animals
[09:38:51] <twb> aidalgol: I can tell you EXACTLY how
[09:39:03] <aidalgol> I'm listening...
[09:39:15] <twb> aidalgol: in the last 5 years, most webdev moved from "I upload some PHP over FTP" to "I do AWS containers"
[09:39:22] <twb> aidalgol: so MS had to roll azure to compete
[09:39:43] <twb> aidalgol: but both of those require you to run linux on your dev system to generate the containers in the first place, i.e. to run "docker emerge" or whatever
[09:40:05] <twb> aidalgol: so EVERYONE was running ubuntu inside VMware/vbox inside windows/macos
[09:40:20] <twb> aidalgol: so LXC is basically to stop people going "why don't I just run Ubuntu directly and skip windows?"
[09:40:28] <twb> er, WSL, not LXC
[09:40:52] <aidalgol> Where does EEE come in?
[09:41:03] <twb> >shrug<
[09:41:10] <twb> but that's (IMO) why WSL exists at all
[09:41:22] <twb> it's driven indirectly by AWS and docker
[09:41:32] <aidalgol> Also, docker on Windows is utter shit, and many of my coworkers have moved to Ubuntu to use docker.
[09:41:38] <aidalgol> After struggling with WSL.
[09:41:54] <aidalgol> And now that Docker Desktop is no longer free for large companies, it's even more of a pain on Windows.
[09:43:02] <twb> aidalgol: why would they struggle
[09:43:14] <twb> aidalgol: unless they're doing something non-CLI in docker, which... makes no sense
[09:44:54] <aidalgol> Mainly because IO in and out of WSL is shit.
[09:45:47] <aidalgol> Even if you can work entirely inside the WSL environment, IO performance is still shit.
[09:46:10] <aidalgol> The UX around the docker service is terrible.
[09:46:23] <twb> aidalgol: oh WSL2?
[09:46:27] <aidalgol> Both.
[09:46:54] <aidalgol> Many people I know who *like* Windows are disappointed with what WSL has shaped up to be, vs what was promised.
[09:46:55] <twb> for me, emacs inside wsl1 is noticably faster than emacs in w32 personality
[09:47:14] <twb> Of course I am comparing it to 9pfs and virtiofs
[09:47:25] <contrapunctus> Anyone know why ERT might report a `should-error` test as failed because it returned an error as expected?
[09:48:18] <twb> OTOH I'm doing things like "du -haxt1G /mnt/c/porn/steam | sort -hr" rather than "download 2GB of docker tarballs and untar them"
[09:48:33] <twb> Maybe what they're doing in docker happens to be stupid?
[09:49:37] <twb> wsl1 also lets me run virt-manager on windows.  Obviously the actual VMs are not on the same system, they're on a remote computer
[09:49:46] <twb> aidalgol: wait wait
[09:49:57] <twb> aidalgol: are these people running the docker containers themselves inside WSL inside windows?
[09:50:35] <twb> aidalgol: why would you do that.  The purpose of wsl is just to avoid porting the provisioning tools to windows.  Not to actually run a production environment.
[09:50:43] <contrapunctus> To signal the error, I'm using `cl-assert` inside the function to be tested.

[16:02:07] <treflip> tykayn1: are you looking for a file manager, that can be used as sidebar with a tree view mode?
[16:02:11] <Guest50> i found emacs git clone master branch is toooo slow
[16:03:06] <Guest50> This
[16:03:09] <Guest50>  git clone -b master git://git.sv.gnu.org/emacs.git
[16:03:40] <tykayn1> yes treflip, i have installed treeview but i dont know how to achieve a regular IDE file browser behavior 
[16:04:08] <tykayn1> ah, i have to go
[16:04:10] <treflip> tykayn1: several packages that can do this exist
[16:04:22] <treflip> I use https://github.com/jojojames/dired-sidebar
[16:04:33] <treflip> also used https://github.com/jaypei/emacs-neotree in the past
[16:04:34] <tykayn1> awesome! i will check that
[16:05:24] <bremner> Guest50: try to put your question all in one line, or use a pastbin for lots of lines of output
[16:05:40] <bremner> Guest50: otherwise your question gets lost in the discussion
[16:05:55] <treflip> Guest50: have you tried to clone it with depth 1?
[16:05:59] <Guest50> i've found solution but , i'm cloning emacs master branch, but it is so so so slow, yes
[16:06:05] <Guest50> yes that depth 1 i'm trying
[16:06:07] <Guest50> :)
[16:06:10] <tykayn1> you can try shallow clone

[17:09:31] <kilobug> dustfinger: there is no difference between utf-8 and us-ascii if you use only standard ascii characters (ie, no accentuated characters, or emoji, or non-latin scripts, ...)
[17:09:34] <dustfinger> gnoo: I inserted a smile character. The smile character just looks like a box with the number 23 written twice. file -i now returns text/plain; charset=utf-8. Why does the smile char not render correctly?
[17:09:39] <rpav> hrm, any easy unix-command way to format a single column into variable-width multiple-column like a simple `ls`
[17:10:10] <gnoo> dustfinger: that means the font emacs is using for that character dosen't have the correct glyph for it
[17:10:11] <kilobug> dustfinger: the smile not rendering is probably a font issue; the font you're using to render the text doesn't have that special character, so it can't display it
[17:11:01] <dustfinger> gnoo, kilobug: Thank you both. That all makes sense. Thank you for your time.
[17:11:11] <gnoo> dustfinger: you can try to eval this in *scratch* assuming you have noto color emoji installed (set-fontset-font t 'unicode "Noto Color Emoji" nil 'prepend)
[17:11:30] <gnoo> or even (set-frame-font "Source Code Pro" 'keep-size t)
[17:11:39] <gnoo> oops sorry that was not it
[17:12:07] <gnoo> i have the previous one as a hook with (add-hook 'after-make-frame-functions (lambda (frame) (interactive) (set-fontset-font t 'unicode "Noto Color Emoji" nil 'prepend))) in my .emacs
[17:12:35] <dustfinger> gnoo: Okay, thank you!
[17:12:54] <gnoo> but i also have a fontconfig generated with blood and sweat to get other applications to use correct font

[23:51:55] <bremner> wasamasa: I think it is some weird attempt at doing pronouns that manages to annoy everyone
[23:52:02] <wasamasa> possibly
[23:52:06] <bremner> well, I guess the true RMS fan is not annoyed
[23:52:08] <wasamasa> I'm only aware of per/pers

[23:52:52] <wasamasa> "Your freedom and privacy: free/ziyou software and beyond"
[23:53:12] <grym> libre, but MOAR 
[23:53:13] <grym> ?
[23:53:43] <wasamasa> it's Chinese for free apparently
[23:54:06] <bremner> probably chinese for a lot of things, give the limits of transliteration
[23:54:08] <grym> that's a yes-ish, then
[23:54:20] <wasamasa> oh wait
[23:54:22] <grym> rudybot: there is no free in ba sing se 
[23:54:29] <wasamasa> could it have to do something with RMS talking to Po Lu
[23:54:34] <rudybot> grym: And there is no war in Ba Sing Se?
[23:54:49] <wasamasa> I think it does
[23:54:52] <grym> judybot: ba sing se, what is it good for
[23:54:53] <judybot> grym: ? What's up with a lot of cuts these days? OK, maybe not a lot, but it seems like a good many folks have had multiple cuts in a short period of time lately. The questions is, why bother? Seems almost like a waste of time to me.
[23:55:01] <bkhl[m]> Seems it means liberty/freedom.
[23:55:18] <wasamasa> yeah, the equivalent of his usage of free
[23:55:19] <bkhl[m]> So I guess avoids the ambiguity in English?
[23:55:28] <bremner> and he hates the French?
[23:55:41] <bkhl[m]> His usage of Free rather. :-)

[23:56:18] <rudybot> grym: Everyone knows that serif typefaces connote maturity and seriousness
[23:56:46] <bremner> true words.
[23:56:56] <bremner> that's why I avoid them.
[23:57:15] <bremner> rudybot: growing up leads to growing old and dying
[23:57:22] <rudybot> bremner: also living leads to growing old and dying.
[23:57:22] <bkhl[m]> 3/5 of my desk neighbours are Chinese, guess I can ask them tomorrow if they think it's accurate.
[23:57:53] <wasamasa> bpalmer: what do you think about emacs master adding native sqlite3 bindings?
[23:58:22] <wasamasa> bpalmer: looking through this month's emacs-devel and it seems there is some controversy involved
[23:58:35] <grym> but, sqlite3 is awesome
[23:58:51] <bpalmer> I haven't looked at emacs-devel in months
[23:58:55] <rpav> GL bindings when
[23:59:06] <wasamasa> I occasionally look at it because I can't take a constant stream of it
