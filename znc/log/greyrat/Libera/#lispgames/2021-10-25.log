[00:04:13] <technomancy> cool; I'm back
[00:27:05] <dthompson> just so everyone knows, totally possible to do a no-deaths playthrough of my game. do not despair! https://img.itch.zone/aW1hZ2UvMTI0Mzg4Ni83Mjc2NjMzLnBuZw==/347x500/bbGiPG.png
[00:27:29] <technomancy> 'shopped!

[00:38:26] <borodust> good, i hope it's impossible not to die in my game ;p

[02:12:30] <mfiano> Also someone _just_ joined the jam :)
[02:21:04] <technomancy> talk about a speedrunner
[02:22:20] <mfiano> I think all the removals have been corrected, except for one, which the author made a mistake and posted his 7DRL game to the jam...maybe he has another one; wasn't clear by his message
[02:25:00] <mfiano> Anyway, I've been thinking of getting into Racket. I spent the last couple months reading about (and trying) different Schemes, and none impress me much,  besides Guile, but the "stable" release I was using had several bugs I found that were confirmed by the devs :)
[02:25:32] <dto> mfiano: scheme is fun. 
[02:25:37] <mfiano> I last looked into Racket about 6 years ago or so, and I thought it was impressive, though I was never a fan of the language-oriented ecosystem
[02:25:40] <dto> i worked extensively in S7 Scheme (custom DSP dialect)
[02:25:48] <dto> have you considered Chicken?
[02:26:09] <mfiano> I like Scheme, I just don't like its minimalism and lack of compatability and required knowledge about all the SRFI's and such
[02:26:38] <mfiano> A Scheme that is usable for the things I'd want to make with it, would include many SRFI's not shipped with iut, and some not even proposed yet :)
[02:26:51] <mfiano> Racket on the other hand, looks usable out of the box, like CL.
[02:27:15] <dto> hmm!
[02:27:18] <dto> well let me know what happens. 
[02:28:26] <mfiano> Scheme is nice because it's such a small language and good for learning and exploratory programming more than most other Lisps. But it's that minimalism and lack of compatibility with other Schemes that puts me off.
[02:28:30] <technomancy> racket is odd because its core devs are all academics but somehow it has the biggest standard library and most practical libs of any scheme
[02:28:44] <mfiano> I do appreciate Scheme, I just don't think its model is right for me on several fronts.
[02:29:00] <dto> chicken has lots of libs. http://eggs.call-cc.org/5/
[02:29:21] <dto> just a thought. at one time i looked into feasibility of porting my game engine to scheme and chicken looked good
[02:29:27] <dto> although, speed might be a problem
[02:29:41] <mfiano> Also if I were to use any Scheme it'd be Guile, if only for its extended TinyCLOS (GOOPS)
[02:29:56] <borodust> technomancy: also racket is going away from scheme :/
[02:30:18] <borodust> most ppl i know don't call it that already)
[02:31:20] <technomancy> borodust: the non-paren syntax? it looked like that might have stalled out. or just regular semantics divergence
[02:32:38] <borodust> smth like that i guess: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3345397/how-is-racket-different-from-scheme
[02:35:18] <mfiano> I believe a language is like a tripod. If it doesn't have a frictionless grammar, prolific ecosystem, and good tooling, it just falls over flat.
[02:39:57] <mfiano> I actually spent the last couple weeks learning Raku (formerly Perl 6). It's actually a much different language than Perl 5, and has a lot of similarities with Common Lisp, including multiple dispatch, special variables, and a meta-object protocol. But it is a fairly complex language, leg 1 above is not very sturdy, and smaller than CL, so leg 2 is completely useless :)
[02:40:58] <mfiano> I love the language, but it's too hard to write the kind of quick exploratory prototyping I like to do, and it's such a small-knit community, so my interest in it is kind of small, despite how nice the actual language itself is.
[02:48:33] <borodust> technomancy: actually, authors seem to specifically distinguishing racket from scheme: https://racket-lang.org/new-name.html
[02:48:58] <mfiano> borodust: That's just marketing, because PLT doesn't want to be called PLT Scheme anymore
[02:49:05] <mfiano> Kinda like Raku and Perl
[02:49:18] <mfiano> marketing doesn't change anything about its roots
[02:50:30] <borodust> to me, it acutally seems exactly the same reason Scheme authors decided to drop Lisp naming
[02:51:01] <borodust> to avoid confusion
[02:51:11] <borodust> it's a different language now :)
[02:51:20] <mfiano> and probably why CL authors don't like to admit large parts of the language was inspired by Scheme.
[02:51:35] <mfiano> marketing and personal reasons don't change the facts :)
[02:51:57] <mfiano> Thre is no "lisp", just a bunch of inbreeding :)
[02:52:18] <borodust> it's fine as long as inspiration don't break backward compatibility (and semantics) too much :)
[02:52:45] <borodust> introducing lexical scope (feature borrowed from Scheme) doesn't break dynamic scoping
[02:53:22] <mfiano> now elisp on the other hand... ;)
[02:54:03] <borodust> hmm, well, i don't really want to get into what is lisp, but there is a lisp, and it is common ;p
[02:54:28] <mfiano> hehe
[02:55:14] <mfiano> Yeah it's pointless trying to classify lisp. To me it's a way of thinking more than a single language.

[06:25:32] <peterhil> Finally I have a playable version of Alchemy uploaded to Tic-80 site: https://tic80.com/play?cart=2302
[06:38:07] <peterhil> mfiano: Alchemy on Itch: https://peterhil.itch.io/alchemy and my submission to Lisp Game Jam: https://itch.io/jam/autumn-lisp-game-jam-2021/rate/1248757
[06:39:33] <peterhil> I hope the cartridge is working!
[06:48:38] <peterhil> I uploaded the HTML dir also here: http://composed.nu/alchemy/
[06:54:24] <Icefoz> I could probably have made something "finished" but it wouldn't have been that good and having a day I actually enjoyed was more important.
[06:54:41] <Icefoz> But I'll probably finish it off by the end of the week anyway, and publish something.
[06:54:49] <Icefoz> It's been a fun time.
[06:57:25] <peterhil> Icefoz: It was tight for me also – I got the game play somehow working just an hour before, and there are still some slight bugs. Also many details could be improved or developed more...
[06:57:34] <peterhil> Sortware is never ready!
[06:58:19] <peterhil> Icefoz: I hope you publish what you have done.
[07:02:39] <Icefoz> I could, sure.
[07:03:48] <Icefoz> Heck lemme do that now, I got half an hour.
[07:04:40] <peterhil> Icefoz: Thats the spirit! :-D
[07:09:58] <Icefoz> Definitely gonna be writing up a postmortem later.
[07:12:44] <technomancy> as long as you learned something and grew your skills that's a win in my book
[07:12:59] <Icefoz> Hell yeah
[07:13:10] <technomancy> there's always some half-finished entries, and it's fun to look at them and imagine how they could have turned out =)
[07:16:44] <peterhil> dto: Cool, there are colours!
[07:18:23] <peterhil> My commit log ended up being kind of fun to read: https://github.com/peterhil/alchemy/commits/main
[07:19:19] <Icefoz> All right, submitted!
[07:20:33] <peterhil> My favourites: "Make the game play work with chaos and balance", "Add random thing and make the game play work", "Adjust Neptune", and "Make the mercurius more mercurial"
[07:24:17] <Icefoz> I like "Add more blue into the poles of jupiter" myself.
[07:24:33] <Icefoz> Like... it could be exactly what you says, or it could be some kind of code phrase from a spy novel.
[07:24:57] <peterhil> LOL!
[07:25:18] <Icefoz> Could someone please confirm this loads properly for them?   https://alopex.li/data/rk2/RocketKiwi2-0.1.0/   and doesn't give a weird permission error or anything

[07:50:31] <mfiano> for autumn jam only though

[07:53:04] <peterhil> I did not have time to make title screen with credits or game play guide. But I would have added my girlfriend Sini’s name on the credits because she helped so much with developing the game idea through ideation of transition screens and helping me clarify the ideas, so I could advance from the initial creative block.
[07:54:02] <peterhil> And in case you are wondering – I did not have time to make the transition screens either. :-D

[23:39:09] <dto> sup dthompson 
[23:41:23] <dto> dthompson, technomancy: beat-by-beat DSP analysis metadata from SchemeMosaic now loads more or less directly into Xelf. https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/4ByH30jC/Screenshot%20at%202021-10-25%2016-08-47.png
[23:43:38] <dto> of particular interest will be kick, snare, cymbal guesses, pitch detection, energy/volume
[23:43:53] <technomancy> wow nice. what's schememosaic?
[23:44:03] <dto> and whatever other properties i can think of making SchemeMosaic analyze
[23:44:47] <dto> https://gitlab.com/dto/mosaic-el/-/blob/master/scheme-mosaic.org     technomancy my custom music dsp thing. 
[23:56:11] <dthompson> wow that's cool
[23:56:27] <dthompson> xelf is truly built with alien technology
