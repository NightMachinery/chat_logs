[02:43:18] <sd> 11<H​otmess> for glory and gain obviously
[02:43:47] <mistiry> i mentioned this morning how anyone with a WAF could block that user agent string as a step until patching could be done
[02:44:11] <mistiry> that only triggers part of the problem. you have to have an actual ldap host to serve the exploit java class file
[02:45:24] <JollyRgrs> so block any outbound LDAP (who has LDAP go out on WAN?)
[02:45:27] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> i guess exploiting this is harder than it looks
[02:45:31] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> right?
[02:45:34] <mistiry> not really
[02:45:40] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> or is harder than what people make it out to be
[02:45:51] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> like you need a very specific set of conditions
[02:45:57] <CptLuxx> epxloiting that is fucking easy
[02:46:02] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> such as LDAP out on WAN
[02:46:20] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> and so is the mitigation CptLuxx
[02:46:42] <JollyRgrs> i'd say a very vast majority do NOT have LDAP on WAN blocked
[02:46:49] <sd> 13<B​lasteh> we block outbound by default
[02:46:51] <sd> 13<B​lasteh> so yeah
[02:47:01] <JollyRgrs> also, afaik, this affects clients as well... anything that can log anything (so sending a message to all users in Minecraft)
[02:47:12] <sd> 13<B​lasteh> most places wouldn't bother with outbound blocks
[02:47:21] <mistiry> JollyRgrs: yes
