[03:14:43] <s87651[m]> mjlbach[m]: Would like to get it working without going to this extreme, but seeing as `pyright`, a python language server packaged on npm, also has these issues, I feel as if it might be indictive of a bigger neovim problem
[03:15:02] <mjlbach[m]> I use pyright daily, without any issues with virtual environments, so it's not a neovim issue
[03:15:41] <mjlbach[m]> pyright automatically picks up on the active virtual environment's environmental variables, so you just active the venv before launching neovim
[03:16:21] <s87651[m]> mjlbach[m]: Yeah, I am doing this, it still doesn't pick up on the packages
[03:17:15] <mjlbach[m]> don't know what to tell you then, if I install pyright from npm in a docker container, create a new virtual environment or conda environment, install a package with typestubs (like numpy), everything works fine

[03:21:04] <mjlbach[m]> pandas for example has a separate package with typestubs you can install

[03:21:34] <mjlbach[m]> What is the package?
[03:21:34] <s87651[m]> But I'm unsure if that ambiguous because of typestubs, or because of another issue

[03:31:41] <mjlbach[m]> Hmm still works fine for me

[06:07:32] <bluemonksr[m]> Could not find this in Nanotee's  excellent guide. Is `vim.fn.exectue()` same as `vim.api.nvim_command()`?
[06:09:33] <ii14[m]> no
[06:10:21] <ii14[m]> or actually I'm not sure, last time I checked all of these functions for evaluating vim script had their own quirks
[06:11:35] <bluemonksr[m]> i understand that `vim.api.nvim_command` can return the eval result as its just a "run this vim code" whereas `vim.api.nvim_command()` is like callin `exe foo` in vimscript
[06:11:59] <bluemonksr[m]> s/nvim_command/nvim_exec/
[06:12:29] <bluemonksr[m]> bluemonksr[m]: but dont know how different `vim.fn.execute()` is
[06:14:24] <ii14[m]> nvim_exec should be the closest to evaluating vim script as if it was done by `:source` command
[06:16:25] <ii14[m]> nvim_command might have problems with script local variables or line breaks, but you'd have to check that
[06:18:05] <bluemonksr[m]> ii14[m]: Ah forgot all about the `:source` stuff. thanks for the reminder!!
[06:18:08] <ii14[m]> another difference is that nvim_exec creates a script context, and evaluate() inherits the context from the script where it was called from. at least in vim script, not sure how it behaves in lua

[06:19:21] <bluemonksr[m]> also how did you find this info? there is nothing on `fn.execute()`. did you just look up `execute()` from vimscript?
[06:19:51] <ii14[m]> trial and error, as I don't think it's documented
[06:20:59] <ii14[m]> execute() is a vim script function

[06:21:00] <ii14[m]> `:h execute()`

[13:54:31] <bitblt[m]> I currently have a custom implementation that does not actually check/detect the project type, but relies on the filetype plugin to setup some global variables. So on *.rs I set g:build_cmd = "cargo build" and g:run_cmd = "cargo run", on *.js I do set g:build_cmd = "npm run build" and g:run_cmd = "npm run serve" etc.
[13:55:07] <bitblt[m]> Then my (also) custom terminal / runner plugin just launches a new tab with a terminal running the g:build_cmd or g:run_cmd in specific mappings

[22:47:56] <BennyPowers[m]> yes. given a treesitter node, i'm traversing up the tree looking for a certain node type, ending at "the document"
[22:47:56] <BennyPowers[m]> I believe my "the document" predicate is incomplete, but debugging is difficult because the only way I know i missed it is because nvim enters an infinite loop, at which point i have to kill the process.
[22:47:56] <BennyPowers[m]> So i'd like to limit my traversal function to, say 1 second, and bail with an error message if i can't find what im' looking for

[22:49:51] <gpanders> for traversing up a tree you typically just have a condition for the current node either 1) not being nil or 2) not being the same as the last node, and then in each iteration of the loop you set the current node to its parent
[22:50:11] <gpanders> but to answer your question more generally, you can just create a counter variable and if the counter exceeds some value (e.g. 1000000) break the loop and report an error
[22:50:40] <BennyPowers[m]> yeah that 2nd option sounds reasonable
[22:50:55] <BennyPowers[m]> because i'm (i think) dealing with embedded languages option 1 isn't so simple
[22:51:27] <BennyPowers[m]> my current predicate looks like this:... (full message at https://libera.ems.host/_matrix/media/r0/download/libera.chat/b04eb465491a0d76e122ea041601baabaf73221b)

[23:04:59] <peki> and adding it to Coc's config file like so

[23:05:16] <peki> however
[23:05:19] <peki> that crashes the server
[23:05:48] <peki> and trying to use it via the CLI shows the same situation
