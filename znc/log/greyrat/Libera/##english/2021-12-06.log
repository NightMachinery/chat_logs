[00:44:51] <Tanuki> I'm confused. What does an SSD drive have to do with sound quality? Are those people praising it on the forums being ironic?
[00:45:21] <huf> i *think* they're seriously (but harmlessly) insane
[00:45:39] <Tanuki> This sounds like some woo-woo to me. :/
[00:46:10] <huf> the upper echelons of audiophilia were always woo
[00:46:18] <huf> it just became even more absurd with digital stuff

[00:46:45] <Tanuki> I have a friend who keeps insisting that FLAC files are lossy and legitimately sound different than their source.
[00:46:50] <Tanuki> This reminds me of that.
[00:47:00] <huf> TimMc: that too. more obvious and more absurd :)
[00:47:16] <TimMc> I need to get into business making bespoke audio file formats.
[00:47:27] <huf> at least with analog stuff, the chunks of material matter
[00:47:36] <huf> so you can handwave yourself to victory
[00:47:48] <huf> but this is literally believing that a good novel needs to be written in gold ink otherwise it's a bad novel
[00:48:46] <TimMc> or maybe I should make nylon mesh sleeves for the cables and call them "EM field guides" and make up some hokum about them clarifying the data or whatever
[00:48:55] <TimMc> $500 each, naturally
[00:49:09] <Tanuki> Yeah, that's the stuff I'm talking about.
[00:49:19] <Tanuki> Or "crystals" that you put under speakers.
[00:49:27] <TimMc> That might be too obvious.
[00:49:38] <huf> so do it under a different brand name
[00:49:43] <Tanuki> Made of some "special" mineral only found in the anus of a near-extinct kind of water buffalo.
[00:49:49] <huf> people believe in oils

[00:50:00] <TimMc> You don't call them crystals, you call them... quartz resonators

[01:40:17] <twJizhan> I have a serious question to ask
[01:40:25] <twJizhan> how to train my poor listening comprehension on IRC
[01:40:27] <twJizhan> ?
[01:40:45] <Tanuki> On IRC? I mean IRC is text-only, so I'm not sure I understand.
[01:41:41] <kurahaupo> dTal: also at https://audiophilestyle.com/forums/topic/62753-nvme-ssd-designed-for-audiophiles/?do=findComment&comment=1127853 they claim that reducing the usage by ⅔ increases the lifespan by 300% when they probably mean increase it by a factor of 3. Aside from all the random woo, they don't understand percentages either
[01:45:09] <twJizhan> ... I am unsure is "asking training listenning comprehension on ##English" a joking or a good question...
[01:45:31] <kurahaupo> twJizhan: Wouldn't you need a source of audio material to train your listening ability? How would IRC be involved?
[01:46:07] <twJizhan> oh okay sorry for bothering
[01:47:48] <Tanuki> You're not bothering. We're genuinely curious how something like that could work.
[01:47:57] <kurahaupo> twJizhan: in «a joking or a good question» the second «a» should be omitted
[01:48:17] <Tanuki> I wonder if IRCv3 had an audio interface of some kind.
[01:48:22] <Tanuki> Where this could be done.
[01:49:17] <kurahaupo> twJizhan: or the word «question» should also be repeated.
[01:50:01] <twJizhan> oh :o
[01:50:04] <twJizhan> thank you
[01:50:07] <twJizhan> :)
[01:51:24] <Tanuki> Are guillemets used in English?
[01:51:28] <kurahaupo> you're welcome
[01:51:29] <Tanuki> It's the first time I've seen them used.
[01:51:50] <kurahaupo> not normally, but it's helpful when nesting quotes
[01:51:55] <Tanuki> Yeah, I see.
[01:52:19] <Tanuki> I've only ever seen them used in French and (European) Spanish, so it confused me.
[01:52:45] <twJizhan> Maybe ##English on Discord will be more like IRC plus audio... but currently unsure are such servers popular
[01:53:37] <twJizhan> need to check info on sites like reddit
[01:55:15] <kurahaupo> twJizhan: There's some antipathy towards Discord among the IRC communities, because it's not an open protocol, and the servers are all all closed source.

[07:51:38] <DynV> perhaps you can show me a page closer to my initial post?
[07:52:28] <DynV> I'm ESL, so my "natural" inclination toward words is limited.
[07:53:09] <LjL> you could just say something like "whiny", those words tend to have a connotation of complaining "a lot" but at the same time, of complaining "for no good reason"
[07:53:11] <DynV> (although I've been spending a lot of time with english since pre-teen)
[07:54:35] <DynV> Although I'm not fully convinced about vexatious, I'm convinced it's better than whiny.
[07:58:12] <LjL> except the meaning of "without a good reason" is really only in the legal sense
[07:58:38] <LjL> the primary meaning of vexatious from Wiktionary is "Causing vexation or annoyance; teasing; troublesome."
[07:58:53] <LjL> vexation in turn is "The act of annoying, vexing, or irritating."

[12:13:10] <blkshp> Neither are accep...  What he said! ^

[12:13:27] <shan> Me-me + blkshp: Right, thanks!
[12:13:28] <blkshp> and Moodle would have a capital letter.
[12:13:40] <Me-me> blkshp: He didn't say which is grammatically correct, he said which is more grammatical.
[12:13:41] <Me-me> :D
[12:14:16] <shan> blkshp: right, ofc
[12:14:17] <blkshp> I'd go with "Moodle went down this morning"
[12:14:32] <blkshp> !w Moodle
[12:14:34] <tinsoldier> Moodle — Verb: 1. To dawdle aimlessly, to idle time away. https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/moodle
[12:14:42] <shan> I don't actually know when it went down, which is the pickle
[12:14:43] <Me-me> Well, assuming "down" refers to a state of being, I would say, "Moodle seems to have been down since this morning."
[12:14:58] <twb> I think "have been down" is a needlessly complicated tense.
[12:15:08] <Me-me> Or maybe, "Moodle seems to have been feeling down since this morning."
[12:15:09] <shan> Me-me: that's what i've changed it to, for now
[12:15:10] <blkshp> Ah, in which case delete my comment :)
[12:15:27] <Me-me> shan: Well it depends on the context. blkshp's assumption may or may not have been accurate, in which case mine is inaccurate.
[12:15:38] <twb> blkshp: moodle is a shitty web app for making students do homework in a GUI web browser
[12:15:45] <Me-me> Ah!
[12:15:58] <shan> what twb said. I don't actually mind it though, atleast it's foss
[12:15:59] <twb> like blackboard but less bad
[12:16:08] <blkshp> Do schoolkids use books these days!?
[12:16:12] * blkshp humphs
[12:16:30] <twb> blkshp: when I was in school 20 years ago, I had to carry physical books AND a laptop with digital books
[12:16:36] <shan> My school is bent on hosting it themselves instead of paying for a hosted instance so it goes down all the time.
[12:16:59] <Me-me> Books are outdated. They overtook parchment millenia ago, and overtook chalkboards more recently, but their time in the sun is waning.
[12:17:04] <twb> shan: jupyter is mostly OK, but moodle just makes me angry
[12:17:04] * blkshp hadn't even touched a laptop when he left school.
[12:17:18] <blkshp> We had many desktops in school but no laptops.
[12:17:28] <shan> Whenever some slight inconvenience happens, like a quiz or something. So I was just writing to my professor to please make us a Teams assignment to submit our work on because there's no way to submit it on Moodle, since it's down.
[12:17:38] <twb> I do think that computer scientists should not be allowed to use a computer for their first year of undergraduate studies
[12:17:45] <Me-me> shan: Ach, my condolences.
[12:17:57] <shan> twb: Good thing I'm an EE major? ;_;
[12:18:00] <Me-me> I would say "has been down", then since "went down" seems almost confrontational.
[12:18:04] <shan> Me-me: ty
[12:18:07] <Me-me> If that makes sense.
[12:18:13] <shan> that does make sense
[12:18:17] <twb> I would go so far as to say "down for me"
[12:18:39] <blkshp> "It ain't working, yo"
[12:18:53] * blkshp gets ready for work.
[12:18:57] <Me-me> Ah, indeed. But then it opens up the rhetorical facet of, "Well, that's your problem then."
[12:19:02] <twb> "I can't access moodle since 2021-12-06T02:00+13:00 --- the problem seems to be in moodle, see attached debug logs"

[12:20:06] <shan> It's due at midnight today ;_; it's 2pm
[12:20:07] <twb> That's for assignments with a submission window of about 10 days, though
[12:20:17] <Me-me> twb: Unnecessarily harsh. If you want it submitted earlier, move the submission date up.
[12:20:23] <shan> ^

[19:46:24] <furrykef> Enough that I'd avoid the phrase entirely, myself.
[19:46:37] <furrykef> Since no matter which way you spell it, a lot of people will think you got it wrong.
[19:47:32] <Tanuki> Well, the standard way is with one "s" -- the confusion stems from the pronunciation, and M-W explains why there's a disconnect there: https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/just-deserts-or-just-desserts
[19:47:54] <Tanuki> That's why it's so tricky.
[19:48:27] <pussipupu> "Just Desserts" should be a book about moral philosophy as pertains to pudding
[19:48:39] <furrykef> Right. But also "desserts" seems to make sense as a metaphor.
[19:48:50] <Tanuki> Hah. Yeah, Wiktionary does mention that "just desserts" is used as a pun by some restaurants.
[19:49:23] <Tanuki> furrykef: That's another good reason. It's like the phrase was meant to exist as an orthographic troll.
[19:49:38] <furrykef> I actually learned it as "desserts" first and had to unlearn it.

[20:34:06] <cousteau> What's the gender-neutral word for "mansplaining"? 
[20:36:02] <cousteau> i.e. "explaining something to someone who already knows it, treating them like an idiot for not knowing it, and actually not knowing it themselves" 
[20:36:26] <cousteau> I think I'm going to start using "personsplaining" 
[20:36:53] <bin> mansplaining is just fine
[20:37:33] <cousteau> Yeah but I don't know if the person performing it is a man (not like it's relevant anyway) 
[20:37:48] <bin> since it applies to men 99% of the time, and if women behave in that way then it's masculine socialization and mansplaining works fine too. "personsplaining" makes no sense 
[20:39:04] <cousteau> mansplaining   (informal, derogatory) The act of condescendingly explaining something, particularly99,99 by a man to a female listener, in order to appear knowledgeable, or from a mistaken presumption that she has an inferior understanding of the topic. 
[20:39:10] <bin> yes
[20:39:15] <cousteau> Particularly in italics, so maybe you're right 
[20:40:33] <cousteau> Only it wasn't necessarily by a man, and it wasn't to a woman, so I don't think the definition really fits 
[20:41:44] <cousteau> And "being an idiot" isn't specific enough 
[20:42:34] <Tanuki> Yeah, that's too generic. "Mansplaining" also involves sounding arrogant and/or condescending.
[20:42:37] <TimMc> I'd use "mansplaining" even if a woman does it.
[20:43:21] <Tanuki> Yeah, I'd be inclined to use it as well.
[20:44:19] <TimMc> It might have a bit of an ironic feel that way, but that seems fine.
[20:45:21] <brigand> "From whom are you expecting a visit?" is that correct?
[20:45:29] <brigand> also hi :)
[20:46:34] <cousteau> Sounds right to me, but I've never quite gotten "whom" right 
[20:47:13] <huf> very entish
[20:47:47] <brigand> maybe "Who are you expecting a visit from?" is more common
[20:48:02] <huf> i'd say so yeah
[20:48:04] <cousteau> I still don't know how often you're supposed to use "whom", nor if it's pedantic, or even hypercorrect sometimes 
[20:48:25] <brigand> yeah, it's hard
[20:48:36] <Tanuki> brigand: The typical rule of thumb is to substitute "him", "her" or "them" (in the corresponding declarative sentence) and see if the sentence makes sense. This would be "I am expecting a visit from them," which checks out, so it seems fine. But the more idiomatic way, in North American English anyway, is "Who are you expecting a visit from?" Some would tell you to avoid this since it has a preposition at the end, but ignore that. It's fine.
[20:48:59] <brigand> Tanuki: nice. thank you!
[20:50:14] <cousteau> Shouldn't that be "Whom are you expecting a visit from" if we're being picky? 
[20:50:55] <brigand> dang
[20:50:56] <brigand> :D
[20:50:59] <cousteau> "Who are you expecting to visit you?" - there, whom cowardly avoided :) 
[20:51:15] <Tanuki> That's a really awkward, unidiomatic way to say it, though.
[20:51:27] <Tanuki> Most native speakers wouldn't use that wordiing.
[20:51:30] <Tanuki> wording*
[20:51:51] <cousteau> "Who's coming?" 
[20:52:24] <Tanuki> That would be informal, since you used a contraction. "Whom" constructions are typically highly formal.
[20:53:27] <cousteau> Formal enough that I was never taught them in school (as a non-native English speaker) and had to learn about them on the internet :(

[21:28:11] <pussipupu> oh ignore those examples, but also you don't mean "verbs"
[21:28:22] <SymbioticFemale> right i meant vowels
[21:29:18] <boosterooster> sylt (german island) has no vowels
[21:29:26] <LjL> y is definitely a vowel in that instance
[21:29:33] <LjL> y was also a vowel in greek from the start
[21:29:40] <boosterooster> no its a consonant!!
[21:29:46] <pussipupu> as I hear it pronounced  "latinx" has the syllables each with one vowel
[21:29:56] <LjL> the whole "y is not a vowel" in english comes from some weird misconception that because "a e i o u" were the vowels in Latin, that also applies to English
[21:29:56] <boosterooster> "brother"
[21:30:22] <boosterooster> LjL: does that mean that I am weird? i strongly disagree!!

[21:38:04] <huf> the whole thing barely makes sense, a e i o u are letters, not sounds. you could get away with this kind of sloppiness in latin because it had more predictable spelling

[21:38:54] <huf> but yeah, y obviously represents vowels all over the spelling

[21:39:08] <boosterooster> huf: obviously
[21:39:53] <pussipupu> the e in time is a null vowel which mutates the i
[21:40:05] <huf> yeah, y is as much of a vowel as e :)
[21:40:23] <boosterooster> pussipupu: are you a p**** that makes pupu?
[21:40:28] <cousteau> Thing is, in English all syllables have one vowel, or at least one vowel sound.  There are languages that don't have this requirement. 
[21:40:40] <boosterooster> hebraic
[21:40:47] <huf> what
[21:40:48] <boosterooster> dunno how to write
[21:40:49] <huf> that's full of vowels
[21:41:14] <boosterooster> hebrew
[21:41:18] <huf> yes
[21:41:28] <LjL> cousteau, that depends on how you define a vowel, though. if a vowel is whateve can constitute the nucleus of a syllable then things like those Slavic letters still have a syllabic "r", a vowel under that definition. then there are languages where the concept of a syllable doesn't make much sense in the first place, so maybe those count
[21:41:43] <huf> doesnt english have syllabic N's?
[21:41:48] <huf> or L's?
[21:41:49] <huf> something.
[21:41:56] <huf> "bottle"
[21:41:57] <LjL> n can be syllabic in many dialects yes
[21:41:57] <boosterooster> also it is interesting why are there fewer vowels that the other stuff?
[21:42:01] <LjL> yes that too
[21:42:18] <LjL> sometimes there is a schwa somewhere in there though, it may depend on the dialect
[21:42:38] <LjL> boosterooster, there aren't. english has something like 30 vowels, although i'd have to link to wikipedia to show that
[21:42:46] <LjL> swedish has some 18 or so vowels
[21:43:18] <LjL> https://wals.info/ has some rough categorizations of languages by how many vowels they have, among other things
[21:43:27] <huf> yeah, we've got 14 different spellings for ... a bit more than that, but they're not very important

[22:30:33] <LjL> pussipupu, huf: we nearly don't use UK except (in expanded form) officially in the news and such, but even feels like a bit of a recent thing whereas "Great Britain" used to be the "official" term in the news etc... and "England" really tends to be what people use to mean the whole country :P we know it's "wrong", but we'll only be self-conscious about it in the presence of a Scot or similar
[22:32:03] <cousteau> LjL: and now in the sticker you have to put in cars to drive them abroad 
[22:32:10] <LjL> i read, yes
[22:32:24] <cousteau> (except in Ireland) 
[22:32:44] <LjL> but i meant "we" as in Italians
[22:32:50] <cousteau> Oh 
[22:33:30] <huf> LjL: yeah, similar
[22:33:49] <cousteau> Well you probably use "I" then :P unless within the EU with a EU license plate 
[22:34:55] <Tanuki> I'm actually learning German now, and that problem is so pervasive, that my book actually has "Großbritannien" as the country's name and "Engländer" and "Engländerin" as the demonym.
[22:35:27] <huf> well, what can you say then
[22:35:27] <LjL> cousteau, i think pussipupu knew what i meant, and also there's more than one italian ;(
[22:35:29] <huf> yooker?
[22:35:31] <pussipupu> It'll be easier once the UK dies

[22:35:57] <pussipupu> though as I say everyone will still be wrong but also anachronistic
[22:36:10] <cousteau> I try to use UK rather than Great Britain / Britain / England because it's more correct (when it is)

[22:36:48] <huf> the rest is really just the vassals of england anyway :)
[22:36:52] <LjL> Tanuki, yes, i think part of the problem in Italian is demonym too. it'd be easy to switch to "Gran Bretagna" or even "Regno Unito" if we had a meaningful adjective for it... we do have "britannico" but it's very stilted and almost never applies to *people*, so we can only say "inglese", "scozzese" or whatever applies
[22:36:57] <cousteau> LjL: >:( you know I was talking about car stickers, not pronouns 
[22:37:10] <LjL> cousteau, ... oh
[22:37:17] <LjL> cousteau, actually no, i'm just stupid
[22:37:22] <cousteau> Haha
[22:37:40] <blkshp> It's rude to laugh at the stupid.
[22:37:55] <LjL> but yes we use "I", but it's rare to see these days, precisely because it's not required in the EU and we have a small "I" on the actual plates
[22:38:21] <LjL> the thing about the Britain sticker is, aside from going back to being required in the EU, they actually changed it from "GB" to "UK" recently
[22:38:35] <Tanuki> LjL: Right. And I guess England is the most prominent one of all, so it gets preferential treatment. It also lists "Englisch" as the language, ignoring all other languages spoken natively in Great Britain.
[22:38:42] <LjL> probably as a somewhat laughable attempt to be more inclusive of Northern Irish while some of them set buses on fire
[22:38:43] <huf> we've got the flag on the plate
[22:38:45] <blkshp> GB doesn't include NI.
[22:38:46] <blkshp> Now it does.
[22:39:11] <huf> who needs more? (I dont know if we have HU on it, it's one of those things you see every day and cant remember)
[22:39:14] <cousteau> I don't know what the Spanish demonym for British is.  ¿"Británico"?  I know the proper one for American is "estadounidense" and not "americano" (the latter would mean "relative to the Americas") 
[22:39:32] <LjL> blkshp, maybe it should be "BI-I"
[22:39:35] <huf> we say "brit"
[22:39:38] <huf> plural "britek"
[22:39:46] <blkshp> ljl lol! :)
[22:39:53] <cousteau> LjL: not probably, it was because of that 
[22:39:54] <Tanuki> cousteau: No; both "estadounidense" and "americano" are acceptable forms for "a person from the USA."
[22:39:57] <LjL> cousteau, we have that too, statunitense. but americano is much more common to mean the same
[22:40:12] <Tanuki> cousteau: "americano/a" also means "from the Americas".
[22:40:14] <LjL> right, same here. statunitense is just more formal and/or more useful if you need to make a distinction
[22:40:26] <cousteau> Tanuki: I think the former is more correct, or at least the latter seems to be avoided in formal contexts 
[22:40:43] <Tanuki> cousteau: It's useful to avoid confusion, I guess.
[22:40:44] * LjL pretends he didn't just see "formal" being equated to "correct" :P
[22:40:58] <Tanuki> "Estadounidense" is, unambiguously, a person from the USA.
[22:42:34] <bin> people just say "Americano" and it's not usually ambiguous because context is present
[22:43:05] <Tanuki> Well, "americano", to be pedantic. In Spanish, demonyms aren't capitalized (like in English.)
[22:43:30] <bin> ok
[22:43:32] <bin> fair
[22:43:41] <bin> I've only ever been called it, don't think I've seen ti written ha
[22:44:12] <Tanuki> Well, I'm assuming you've been called "americana", with the feminine morpheme.
[22:44:13] <Tanuki> lol
[22:44:26] <bin> nah usually it's to the whole group not me personally
[22:44:29] <bin> "ayy americanos"
[22:44:30] <Tanuki> Oh, I see.
[22:44:32] <Tanuki> Right.

[23:01:38] <blkshp> What does "where" mean diskin?
[23:01:48] <diskin> I suppose "Was", but I found a "solution" with "were".
[23:01:58] <diskin> Oops, "were" of course. Apologies.
[23:02:08] <blkshp> ah LD
[23:02:09] <blkshp> :D
[23:02:18] <blkshp> I thought it may be one of them to confise the kids!
[23:02:21] <blkshp> confuse*
[23:02:28] <blkshp> it's was.
[23:02:46] <diskin> Right, because the second "was" is omitted, yes?
[23:03:13] <blkshp> No. think "bag" singular vs "bags" plural.
[23:03:30] <diskin> "Was your bag packed and was your passport ready?"
[23:04:03] <blkshp> That doesn't make a difference to this sentence but... if you had 2 bags, it would be "were".

[23:21:09] <TimMc> "Warning" really might be the most appropriate.
[23:21:15] <cousteau> Or "wow, the default Ubuntu nginx recommends you to..."

[23:22:09] <mdogg> "Recommendation" is stronger than "suggestion".
[23:22:22] <cousteau> TimMc: warning in this context can mean a message that is printed alerting you that you might have done something wrong; in this case it's more a message they give you beforehand 
[23:22:23] <TimMc> "Recommendation" seems fine.
