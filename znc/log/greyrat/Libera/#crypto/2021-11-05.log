[02:43:22] <yanmaani> If I take a point, and multiply it by a scalar, is that guaranteed to be one-way?\
[02:43:41] <yanmaani> e.g. if I take a public key, and multiply it by seven, there's no way to divide it by seven?
[02:45:04] <sarnold> I've wondered about that before but figured '2' or '3' were more likely to be immediately obvious to the right attacker..
[02:53:27] <tolarz> isn't inversion, if possible, pretty cheap in most groups and rings?

[04:05:06] <maroon> yanmaani, unless im not understanding you, assuming the public key is N bits, and you multiply it by 7, someone can take that result, and multiply it by (multiplicative inverse of 7 modulo 2^N), and get the original number
[04:06:49] <maroon> so, the multiplicative inverse of 7 mod 2^64 is 7905747460161236407, so if you start with N, then multiply it by 7. then take that result and multiply it by 7905747460161236407, then get the remainder after divide by 2^64, and you're back to the original number
[04:12:37] <maroon> but if you choose an even number instead of 7, that's not reversible. like multiplying by 2 in a 64bit register, and that bit is lost unless you can still access the carry flag

[15:44:55] <br1ck> @riv, yes this is what i see too, but on the other hand its dan boneh's lesson, I mean maybe there's something tricky I don't see?
[15:45:09] <riv> i suppose you could just repeat it until there is a match
[15:45:59] <riv> there are 2^l hashes, and l ints chosen... so apply birthday to find the chance of a match

[15:47:54] <riv> well it's not exactly birthday, but basically we need to do some probability calculation

[16:01:07] <Chouhartem> riv, actually as it takes the inputs in Z/λ²Z, then there are only λ² possibilities and it takes λ from it, so yeah, from the birthday's bound there should be a collision w.h.p.

[16:02:31] <riv> oh yes youre right, ty
[16:02:56] <riv> why does this not make the hashing process insecure? since there is such a small input space

[16:20:16] <br1ck> @riv, @Chouhartem but the goal is to reach a shared secret, because H is a hash function we may have a collision but on different number
[16:20:37] <br1ck> I did some trials and they failed :/
[16:21:03] <br1ck> I took λ = 5 so H(x) = x mod 5
[16:21:11] <yanmaani> Are there any irreversible operations that can be done on a point, that can also be done on the scalar?
[16:21:36] <Chouhartem> br1ck, if you have a collision on different numbers then you don't share a secret as you output the preimage as a “shared secret”, no?
[16:21:44] <yanmaani> e.g. f(k) = k', f(K) = K', and k'G = K'

[21:59:07] <maroon> yanmaani, if you want a way to map a 2^n space to a scrambled state in a 1:1 relationship that's difficult to reverse, only way i know of is to have a block cipher of the same 2^n block size, then ECB-encrypt the value with a fixed/hidden key
[22:01:45] <maroon> if there's not a block cipher of the same 2^n block size, there's supposed to be a luby-rackoff design that can adjust, but i dont understand that. im pretty sure it's not a good idea to have a pair of 128-bit ecb encrypts for 2 different halves of a 256-bit space, even if they both use different keys
[22:02:19] *** Quits: dna44 (~dna@12.118.196.34) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[22:02:19] <yanmaani> Doesn't have to be 1:1, but has to work for both public and private key.
[22:03:07] <yanmaani> E.g. if N(k) = kG = K, and f(k) = k' and f(K) = K', then N(f(k)) == f(N(k)).
[22:08:12] <maroon> so you're not needing to be able to get back from new-value to original-value?
