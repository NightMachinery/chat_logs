[00:11:34] <lz_> irwiss: why can't we have a big one like the dinosaurs :'(
[00:12:09] <lz_> I wonder if people would hoard toilet paper too
[00:12:26] <irwiss> to be fair we don't even need one that big, relatively smaller ones would wipe out civilization pretty effectively
[00:13:11] <irwiss> and we probably have one, just not detected yet :P
[00:13:30] <lz_> after a few days/weeks it would suck because it would be hard to survive, but at least it would make some interesting times to behold

[00:14:27] <khanred> Sounds ideal
[00:14:43] <lz_> money would probably instantly lose any value
[00:15:05] <lz_> countries with guns would probably use their guns
[00:15:25] <khanred> :D
[00:15:42] <lz_> russia would detonate all its nukes so they don't go to waste
[00:16:35] <JakeSays> lz_: people would hoard toilet paper - covid has proven that.

[00:19:10] <JakeSays> when the pandemic hit hard in early '20 for weeks you couldn't buy a roll of ass wipe around here if your life depended on it.
[00:21:18] <khanred> I never had any issues

[00:21:32] <khanred> I mean I heard the stories but I guess I just don't shit enough
[00:22:12] <JakeSays> khanred: your governor probably didn't go on live tv and tell people to stock up on "toilet paper and other necessities"
[00:22:40] <khanred> Stitt? Pretty sure he just said it was a hox
[00:22:42] <khanred> hoax
[00:22:59] <JakeSays> khanred: huh?

[00:24:13] <JakeSays> i dont know what that has to do with my governor

[00:26:31] <khanred> Did you have your coffee this morning?
[00:26:56] <JakeSays> or oklahoma
[00:27:44] <khanred> You were making a comparison by saying "your governor" so I made a comment about my governor's response to the pandemic
[00:28:49] <JakeSays> i was just stating why there was a run on toilet paper in 2020.
[00:30:10] <khanred> This has been a shit talk

[05:00:34] <Nasp> hehe
[05:00:35] <Suchiman> Nasp: not entirely sure yet, might upgrade to the S7 MaxV Ultra
[05:00:47] <Nasp> The one with washing as well?
[05:01:05] <Suchiman> Nasp: the base station that cleans the mop? yeah
[05:01:09] *** Quits: cliluw (~cliluw@47.147.77.43) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[05:01:15] <Nasp> Wasn't it like 2000 euro?
[05:01:19] <Suchiman> 1.4
[05:01:25] *** Joins: cliluw (~cliluw@47.147.77.43)
[05:01:26] <JakeSays> Suchiman: if you upgrade then you are required by international law to turn the old one in to a robot with lasers
[05:01:34] <Nasp> i kinda wish they would make the base stations smaller
[05:01:36] <Nasp> But wide maybe
[05:01:39] <Suchiman> JakeSays: already has lasers
[05:01:41] <Nasp> So they could easier fit under stuff
[05:01:48] <JakeSays> Suchiman: that burn things?
[05:01:59] <Suchiman> JakeSays: no :( only LIDAR
[05:02:10] <Nasp> But why is it roborock makes every second version with lidar and then camera
[05:02:26] <Suchiman> Nasp: although it will have to be seen if they go bag exclusive on the auto emptying or do cyclone again
[05:02:32] <Suchiman> Nasp: lol yeah
[05:02:41] <Nasp> Suchiman:  They did both- for the S7 plus right?
[05:02:42] <Nasp> Or the dock
[05:02:45] <JakeSays> Suchiman: think austin powers laser boobs
[05:02:46] <Suchiman> yeah
[05:02:48] <Nasp> I think NA was bag based
[05:02:51] <JakeSays> what were those called?
[05:02:52] <Nasp> And EU cyclone
[05:03:06] <Nasp> Would just be nice if they could make it smaller or in two parts
[05:03:11] * JakeSays draws a blank
[05:03:14] <Nasp> One for the dock, and another for the bin
[05:03:20] <Suchiman> JakeSays: wasn't it laser sharks?
[05:03:32] <JakeSays> those were the sharks with lasers
[05:03:37] <JakeSays> the fembots had lasers too
[05:03:59] <Nasp> I want it like this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbuevuY8RHU
[05:04:09] <Nasp> So it can fit under the sink with the garbage can
[05:04:35] <Suchiman> hahaha
[05:05:01] <Nasp> But the auto emptying stuff can't fit anywhere
[05:05:09] <Nasp> I would prefer to hide it away
[05:05:21] <Nasp> Although i can't figure out how they make that garage thing open and close
[05:05:24] <JakeSays> machine gun jubblies
[05:05:28] <Nasp> Like does the vacuum supports it
[05:05:35] <JakeSays> ah they were just regular guns
[05:06:59] <Nasp> Also i can't figure out if any of those window cleaning robots are worth buying
[05:07:20] <Nasp> Suchiman:  But imagine if the base came in two parts
[05:07:28] <Nasp> One for the dock, and another for the emptying
[05:07:34] <Nasp> And then you just needed a hose between them
[05:07:34] <JakeSays> hmm. apparently fembots are also called gynoids
[05:08:00] <_genuser_> question is why are you looking at fembots?
[05:08:29] <JakeSays> _genuser_: accessories for Suchiman's robot vacuum upgrade
[05:08:39] <JakeSays> machine gun jubblies
[05:08:51] <_genuser_> oh I thought next mrs. jake would be a fembot. Does everything without complaining.
[05:09:04] <_genuser_> or mood swings
[05:09:18] <JakeSays> lol
[05:09:40] <_genuser_> JakeSays was the jumblies reference to the austin powers movie?
[05:10:49] <_genuser_> oh wait, those were called fembots. I see now where this is going.
[05:10:58] <JakeSays> lol yes
[05:12:39] <_genuser_> JakeSays it's been a while so youtubing that scene. pretty funny. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTv9AhCuSU4
[05:12:57] <JakeSays> oh! space force season 2 is coming!
[05:13:21] <Nasp> Suchiman:  What did you pay for your S7 and is it the plus with dock?
[05:14:44] <Suchiman> JakeSays: jeez, those are just regular bullet titties :P
[05:15:12] <_genuser_> JakeSays meh a politicized show. I thought it was just trying to sound funny at the expense of half the country.
[05:15:14] <JakeSays> _genuser_: LOL that's it
[05:15:26] <_genuser_> even steve carrell couldn't save it, imo. I watched a few eps and then just gave up.
[05:15:28] <Suchiman> Nasp: 549€ without dock
[05:15:29] <JakeSays> Suchiman: yes, yes. i was confused
[05:15:47] <merced> god i fucking hate these motherboards with the one-sided snaps

[05:16:55] <_genuser_> JakeSays but to be fair, I don't really watch any of the newer stuff. All the marvel verse and dc comic verse disney stuff. 90lb girl kicking a 300lb man and he flies 5miles away. just because womenz!!
[05:17:23] <JakeSays> lol i dont see why that would be an issue
[05:17:49] <JakeSays> '90lb girl' is enough - what she's actually doing is irrelevant
[05:18:14] <Nasp> Suchiman:  I found it to 800 euro with dock
[05:18:32] <JakeSays> Suchiman: just get a wife
[05:18:36] <Suchiman> Nasp: yeah i was considering it but then i was like "nah... not worth that much extra"
[05:18:49] <Suchiman> JakeSays: this bot doesn't bitch around though
[05:18:58] <Suchiman> JakeSays: and i believe the maintenance costs are much cheaper
[05:19:06] <Nasp> And 450 euro withotu dock
[05:19:12] <_genuser_> JakeSays unrealistic parameters for defining equality.
[05:19:13] <JakeSays> Suchiman: they add spice tho
[05:19:34] <Nasp> Suchiman:  I think i would just like it to be able to run often without me needing to emptying it
[05:19:35] <Suchiman> JakeSays: do i assume correctly that you're allergic to spice?
[05:19:37] <JakeSays> _genuser_: that's not the equality part. you miss the point
[05:19:47] <JakeSays> Suchiman: LOL no, just ex wives
[05:20:27] <_genuser_> JakeSays imo, it's showing badass-ness while modelling men's behaviors. imo, the hip-writers missed the point on this. equality should be addressed. But better than ... oh let's remake batman with a woman.
[05:22:05] <JakeSays> _genuser_: they didn't miss the point at all. they're saying "hey, in our movies make believe female characters can make believe kick a fat man just like make believe male characters" - in other words, women can also be strong character
[05:22:24] <_genuser_> JakeSays in other words, one doesn't need to be defined by another. If a man can do this, let's show a woman doing it. Or consider how they extend it to other groups. If white man plays this role, let's get a non-white man to play this role too. Create new roles, Write new stuff. Have some creativity. It's always playing catchup because you're
[05:22:25] <_genuser_> always taking one group and defining that group in terms of another group. People should stand alone.

[05:22:59] <_genuser_> JakeSays it has nothing to do with strength, imo. Same is argued about superman all the times, if he catches a person falling from 100 stories high building, the person will be sliced by his strong arms. Not caught.
[05:23:11] <JakeSays> the easiest way to demonstrate equality is to use something well known
[05:23:31] <Suchiman> Nasp: depends on how much dirt you have ofc, although i have the bot basically next to my computer, next to the garbage bin so when i leave the house typically i just press on the "do everything button", then leave, come back, open up, flip the dust bin over the garbage bin, put back in, sit at PC
[05:24:16] <Nasp> Suchiman:  Would still be nice if the emptying dock was more versatile
[05:24:18] <Suchiman> the main thing about the S7 MaxV Ultra is the auto mop cleaning which is annoying to do by hand xD
[05:24:22] <JakeSays> Suchiman: ah so turn the old vacuubot in to a flipper-emptyer bot for the new vacuubot
[05:24:24] <Nasp> Because who ants that standing around
[05:24:33] <Nasp> Suchiman:  Well the S7 can mob as well
[05:24:43] <Nasp> Are you planning to mob everydyay?
[05:24:48] <_genuser_> JakeSays I'll agree to that, but also add - we don't show men to also be equally feminine by showing them as bitchy and moody. We show them by let's say having a softer side. More sensitive. So no reason to use stereotypes.
[05:24:51] <Nasp> Although i see it could be relevant in a kitchen
[05:25:03] <Suchiman> Nasp: yeah but after the S7 has mopped the floor, you need to wash the mop manually :P
[05:25:15] <JakeSays> i want a bot that will detect dirt and clean only those spots as they happen
[05:25:50] <Suchiman> JakeSays: install cameras on the ceiling, use AI to detect dirt, then send a zone cleaning command to the bot
[05:26:06] <_genuser_> JakeSays real thinking. which is missing in hollywood. even in the standard old remakes of start trek or star wars, it's the same old stuff that keeps getting remade. Nothing new. I haven't see anything interesting since despicable me, imo. Even though that was a standard villain goes good story. But it was done well. And had decent writing for the
[05:26:07] <_genuser_> most part.
[05:26:24] <Suchiman> JakeSays: i'm sure your clock could do that
[05:26:49] <JakeSays> Suchiman: clock v7 will make the bed
[05:27:03] <Nasp> Suchiman:  Can't you just throw the mob in the washing machine
[05:27:11] <Suchiman> Nasp: if i would have one xD
[05:27:19] <Nasp> You dont have one?
[05:27:23] <Nasp> Well i dont have one either
[05:27:31] <_genuser_> Suchiman cameras on the ceiling, right above the bed.... those could get hacked.
[05:27:41] <Suchiman> Nasp: no, i just recently acquired a mini dishwasher xD

[05:35:21] <_genuser_> Nasp I heard the CDC is ready to recommend no masks and regular activities. Which is what I based my comment on. Personally, I'm ok if everybody thinks it's a bid deal. You know work from home and all that.

[08:41:59] <bomb> I'm afraid the Ukrainian-Russian war might have just started,
[09:01:37] <teegee> so, i've got this winforms app that captures mouse movement and is able to replay it. that's done by user32.dll import. Is there a cool way to do that better with .net desktop apps?
[09:03:43] <teegee> I played around wiht a wpf app yesterday and using Mouse.GetPosition() and Window.PointToScreen() but that needs to happen in the GUI thread 🤮
[09:05:38] <bomb> WPF is 🤮 by design
[09:06:09] <bomb> I'd stick with win32 for low level OS stuff like that
[09:08:17] <teegee> yay for 64bit OS :(
[09:14:19] <bomb> win32 is just the name of the API
[09:14:38] <bomb> also known as winapi or more recently "Windows API"
[09:16:26] <teegee> I haven't looked at this in detail, but kernel32.dll and user32.dll just sounded like something that comes out of a 32 bit compatibility layer
[09:19:46] <teegee> alright, I guess I can stick with dll imports then
[09:19:52] <bomb> I wouldn't personally worry about that at all. Windows has phenomenal backwards compatibility up until .NET Core
[09:21:07] <bomb> yeah winforms with DLL stuff is just fine.
[09:25:36] <teegee> maybe i'll split it into a .net standard library that deals with getting and setting mouse cursor. then I can do whatever desktop framework i want. vomit or not

[18:48:31] <tsujp> Let me type please
[18:48:52] <tsujp> If Foo calls a PRIVATE METHOD BAR (because having 500000 line methods is not okay) and part of Bar's job is to call an external API
[18:48:59] <tsujp> Then how do you mock what Bar is doing
[18:49:05] <tsujp> I don't want Bar public, it's an implementation detail
[18:49:12] <tsujp> I don't want bar actually calling Azure, this is a unit test
[18:49:15] <biberu> tsujp: if it's just an internal helper that you want to test you can mark it as internal instead of private
[18:49:35] <jonp> tsujp: this is a possible usecase for "Inversion of Control"
[18:49:40] <biberu> and if you need to test something that uses it you should be able to supply a fake
[18:49:51] <jonp> provide an interface/abstract class to "proxy" that "external resource"
[18:50:03] <jonp> and allow it to be provided via constructor or whatever
[18:50:07] *** Joins: Klinda (~superleag@user/klinda)
[18:50:22] <jonp> then you can mock it for unit tests, and have a "real" one for production, and when you need to change that "real" one later, you can reasonably do so
[18:50:32] <jonp> as you (hopefully) have a good abstraction
[18:50:59] <Nasp> tsujp:  I think maybe i need to se some code because not sure i understand the issue

[19:04:28] <tsujp> Okay here's an example:
[19:05:01] <jonp> don't paste here, gist it
[19:05:05] <tsujp> Link has no ads: https://pastebin.com/embed_js/31Yg3qxK
[19:05:11] <tsujp> It has no ads and has syntax hilighting
[19:05:58] <jonp> yes, using IConfigurationService sounds like a good idea
[19:06:24] <tsujp> I am but you can only call `Mock` on public functions
[19:06:46] <tsujp> Is the solution here to allow the `NetworkManagementClient` to be set in `ConfigurationService`'s constructor?
[19:07:05] <tsujp> `SomeConfigurationService` constructor*
[19:07:16] <jonp> you'd have a `MockConfigurationService` type which you provide to the SomeEntityService constructor
[19:08:05] <tsujp> The code I pasted isn't the unit testing code it's the actual production code
[19:08:15] <tsujp> Why would I have a constructor in production code accepting a `MockConfigurationService` type?
[19:08:35] <jonp> you have a ctor which takes an IConfigurationService type
[19:08:51] <jonp> which you can then implement in your test code as MockConfigurationService
[19:08:54] <jonp> in your test code
[19:09:29] <tsujp> Okay so then I get it to call `DoResourceCreation` and I'm no closer to mocking the `NetworkManagementClient` no?

[19:09:53] <jonp> ok, so for line 36, you'd want to remove the `new`
[19:10:13] <jonp> and instead do `var client = _configurationService.CreateNetworkManagementClient()`
[19:10:43] <jonp> or move "more" logic into IConfigurationService, and have a IConfigurationService.GetExistingResourceNames() method
[19:11:07] <jonp> or just *not* have GetExistingReosurceNames() on that type
[19:11:13] <jonp> and have it as an extension method or something
[19:11:36] <tsujp> I'm even more confused given what you've said there line 36 is _within_ the configuration service
[19:11:44] <jonp> doh, mis-remembering

[19:13:03] <tsujp> Like when you say "move more logic in" it already has a method GetExistingResourceNames
[19:13:08] <tsujp> Line 34
[19:13:12] <jonp> what is it that you want to test here? SomeEntityService or SomeConfigurationService ?
[19:13:15] <tsujp> In class SomeConfigurationService
[19:13:28] <tsujp> The test is for SomeConfigurationService
[19:13:41] <tsujp> I want to test the DoResourceCreation method
[19:13:50] <tsujp> But that method calls a private helper method which itself calls out to the Azure API
[19:13:58] <jonp> if SomeConfigurationService is completely tied to the external resource, then don't bother mocking it
[19:13:59] <tsujp> It's a unit test so I don't want ti _actually_ calling out to Azure
[19:14:19] <jonp> you don't need to test *everything*
[19:14:26] <jonp> that might be something that isn't worth testing
[19:14:55] <tsujp> I don't know this is quite basic to do in Rails or elsewhere but.. impossible(?) here..?
[19:15:04] <jonp> otherwise, if you *do* want to test SomeConfigurationService, then you'll want to add a new IAnotherService interface
[19:15:17] <jonp> and have SomeConfigurationService take that as a constructor parameter
[19:15:18] <tsujp> I tihnk it's pretty important this method is tested, it's job is to take input resources, compute a unique name, and then that unique name is used in the `DoResourceCreation`
[19:16:33] <Nasp> So mock DoResourceCreation?
[19:17:20] <tsujp> How...?
[19:17:30] <tsujp> How do I mock that if it dpeends on data returned from a private method
[19:17:41] <Nasp> Design it otherwise?
[19:17:51] <jonp> by having the private method invoke an interface method on something provided to the ctor
[19:18:01] <tsujp> Okay
[19:18:56] <tsujp> How do you provide arguments to a dependency injected constructor?
[19:19:05] <tsujp> Lines 3 through 8
[19:21:11] <tsujp> Oh I cannot even do that if I knew because Azure NetworkManagementClients require a value I don't know until CreateAResourceForMe is called

[21:24:54] <alex88> BtbN, I'll have to figure out how much of the runtime they'll be using

[22:39:34] <jonp> alguien: typically, localization is done on a per-assembly basis.
[22:39:59] <jonp> so you can have multiple assemblies, each with their own satellite assemblies
[22:40:51] <alguien> jonp, and if i want to show diff messages to diff users from diff countries, how does that work?
[22:41:11] <jonp> there really should be a tutorial
[22:41:27] <jonp> but in theory, each request could set CultureInfo.CurrentCulture to the right language based on the request
[22:41:37] <jonp> and the localization infrastructure will Do The Right Thing™
[22:42:01] <jonp> behold, a sample! https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/localization?view=aspnetcore-6.0
[22:42:15] <ki9a> localization in .net isn't like the most friendly thing though
[22:42:22] <jonp> oh god no
[22:42:27] <jonp> where's gettext() when i want it?
[22:42:34] <ki9a> thats what I mean
[22:42:40] <ki9a> one of the few good things to come out of gnu
[22:42:43] <jonp> Mono.Unix has a binding for gettext
[22:42:53] <ki9a> i used those last time
[22:42:55] <jonp> the VSMac team had troubles making it work under .NET 6
[22:43:04] <jonp> 'cause dotnet fucked up setting env vars
[22:43:23] <jonp> specifically, Environment.SetEnvironmentVariable() doesn't actually set env vars in .NET Core!
[22:43:27] <jonp> not for C libs!
[22:43:32] <jonp> it's *not* setenv/putenv
[22:43:45] *** Quits: cliluw (~cliluw@47.147.77.43) (Remote host closed the connection)
[22:43:53] <jonp> so if you're interacting with native libs which want an env var, you need to P/Invoke setenv!
[22:44:00] <jonp> which is fucking hilarious!
[22:44:05] <jonp> i mean the opposite of that.

[22:46:45] <jonp> Suchiman: Environment.SetEnvironmentVariable() is "visible to" Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable()
[22:46:51] <jonp> …and that's about it
[22:47:00] <jonp> so if everything is managed code, you're fine.
[22:47:11] <jonp> if you use System.Diagnostics.Process, you're fine.
[22:47:22] <jonp> if you P/Invoke anything native, and that lib wants env vars, you're fucked
[22:48:39] <ki9a> is there a good reason for this?
[22:49:23] <jonp> "security"/"sanity"/"no memory corruption"
[22:50:54] <jonp> ah, this is better

[22:51:43] <Suchiman> setenv not thread safe haha
[22:51:50] <jonp> and worse
[22:51:52] <jonp> > So there you have it. The situation is a mess. You can't access environment variables safely from multiple threads and can't portably call setenv or putenv without introducing memory leaks.
[22:52:32] <jonp> anyway, nobody should write C anyway ;-)
[22:52:50] <ki9a> heh
[22:53:09] <Suchiman> jonp: https://i.imgflip.com/65m7a5.jpg
[22:53:28] <jonp> it's not "worthless" per-se
[22:53:32] <jonp> it's Fraught With Peril
[22:53:34] <ki9a> We should just port gettext to .net
[22:53:43] <jonp> i think the GNU folks did that, actually
[22:53:50] <jonp> but nobody wants a GPL .dll
[22:54:04] <ki9a> true
[22:54:43] <jonp> Suchiman: char *c = strdup("value"); setenv("key", c, 1); free(c);
[22:54:47] <jonp> Is That A bug™
[22:54:49] <jonp> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[22:54:55] <jonp> which is the problem, in a nutshell
[22:55:15] <ki9a> So i think we found our trickiest bit in buyin ga new house
[22:55:18] <ki9a> the kitchen!
[22:55:37] <ki9a> the bathroom is a good 2nd contender though
[22:55:47] <jonp> kitchens are surprisingly difficult
[22:55:53] <ki9a> too many options
[22:56:02] <jonp> been watching House Hunters w/ my wife
[22:56:13] <jonp> and it's impressive how often the kitchens are just bad
[22:56:22] <jonp> …and how often the purchasers are insane
[22:56:40] <jonp> "oh noes, it doesn't have granite and stainless steel!!! whatever shall we do!!!!"
[22:56:55] <jonp> but sometimes those kitchens are just bad
[22:57:19] <alguien> jonp, thanks for the link

[23:46:45] <herkus> Hello, I have some what of a weird question.
[23:47:34] <herkus> in .NET is it possible to be somehow conscious of whether a user is in the office or working from home?
[23:48:08] <herkus> This place is dead huh.  Did everyone go back to freenode?
[23:48:56] <ki9a> what if my pc is at the office, but I'm remoting in from home?
[23:48:58] <ki9a> where am I?
[23:49:13] <herkus> right thats fine
[23:49:22] <herkus> you are at the office then
[23:49:35] <herkus> but if you are at home, joined to the network
[23:49:46] <herkus> how can I be conscious of that
[23:50:06] <ki9a> not really
[23:50:13] <herkus> thats kinda what i figured.
[23:50:16] <ki9a> you'd hae to define how a work network is dfferent from a home one
[23:50:28] <herkus> I believe them to be the same VPN

[23:51:13] <ki9a> the last office I was in the only thing the office network offered over internet was printer and sonos access
[23:51:28] <herkus> Something works at the office, but not outside of it.
[23:51:34] <ki9a> which curiously isn't all that different from my home :)
[23:51:39] <herkus> And I don't want to bother the user with a checkbox or popup
[23:51:53] <herkus> and im trying to determine whether or not I can somehow be consicous.
[23:51:59] <herkus> Other than specifying each machine name
[23:52:12] <herkus> "This is a home machine, this is an office machine"
[23:52:30] <Suchiman> herkus: do you wanna see if the machine is connected to the office network? check for an internal server address if it's reachable
[23:52:37] <Suchiman> wanna check if the PC is domain joined? check that
[23:53:03] <herkus> domain will be the same I believe
[23:53:24] <herkus> "internal server address" im going to look into that'
[23:53:32] <irwiss> vpn access point has logs, and often a separate ip range for remote endpoints
[23:53:52] <herkus> but can i even see those from within a .net app?
[23:54:13] <herkus> hmmm
[23:54:15] <herkus> IP eh
[23:54:20] <herkus> that might also be helpful
