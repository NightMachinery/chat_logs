[12:55:46] <pepeiborra> drsooch[m]: alanz would know. But in any case, if ghc-exactprint need to be updated for head, best to open an issue in the repo
[13:53:17] <alanz> The sync of ghc-exactprint and head has been on my mind recently.  I am not sure where it should live. And suspect something like for haddock might make sense

[16:43:13] <drsooch[m]> Ah ok I've been incrementally building hls for 9.3 and ran into exactprint issues. I've slowly made changes to a local version of exactprint but wasn't sure if someone was actively working on it

[18:39:59] <fendor[m]> Do we have HACKING.md docs or something like that? If not, we should make some
[18:43:15] <michaelpj> fendor: https://haskell-language-server.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing/index.html
[18:43:40] <fendor[m]> great, I am just blind, thank you!
[18:43:55] <michaelpj> maybe we should make a `CONTRIBUTING.md` that just links to that...
[18:46:54] <fendor[m]> not sure that's necessary, I was really not looking closely enough
[18:47:35] <michaelpj> the user is always right: if it wasn't where you looked for it and it's cheap to fix that, we might as well do it
[18:48:20] <fendor[m]> yeah, I did expect a top-level contributing.md, and didn't even read the directory names...
[18:48:35] <michaelpj> it's linked to from the README, but ðŸ¤·
[18:49:42] <fendor[m]> yeah, I was just being dumb. I think it is fine as is

[19:45:43] <maerwald> fendor[m]: did you see https://github.com/haskell/vscode-haskell/pull/533/commits/096db706df9593f1b8912229061eff833e0ab3ef
[19:46:19] <maerwald> I find this much more intuitive, but it's a config change. I'm not sure how extension devs communicate such things to users
[19:47:25] <fendor[m]> yes, but no time to review yet. I agree with your re-organisation of variables, but would like to think about it without stress (e.g. not during a coffee break)
[19:47:50] <maerwald> you are stressed during coffee breaks? :D
[19:48:24] <fendor[m]> not sure either how to communicate it but ignorePATH is very new and hasn't been published yet
[19:48:54] <maerwald> It's questionable anyway... you can adjust your PATH before you launch vscode.
[19:49:09] <maerwald> I'm sure there's even an extension for that to do it from within vscode
[19:49:50] <fendor[m]> hehe, no, but thorough reviews take time sometimes, and I don't want to look at it and be like, damn, I should be back to work since five minutes
[19:50:25] <maerwald> corporate slavery
[19:50:38] * maerwald continues idling in r/antiwork
[19:51:35] <fendor[m]> I prefer r/workReform nowadays ðŸ˜€
[20:07:52] <dpratt> maerwald: is that your PR?
[20:08:08] <maerwald> what pr?
[20:08:35] <dpratt> the one you linked? https://github.com/haskell/vscode-haskell/pull/533/commits/096db706df9593f1b8912229061eff833e0ab3ef
[20:08:40] <maerwald> yes
[20:12:41] <dpratt> maerwald: nice; I am too much of a Haskell neophyte to provide any useful feedback, but I did notice the path separator is the wrong one on line 86 of README.md :)
[20:13:24] <maerwald> dpratt: both separators are valid on windows
[20:13:46] <maerwald> but I guess it might be confusing
[20:23:08] <dpratt> maerwald: I know they are mostly interchangeable; either way, just looks weird to have it switch to the other at the end :)
[20:24:13] <maerwald> yeah

[23:25:36] <mpickering> drsooch[m]: Are you trying to make ghcide work with HEAD?
[23:32:03] *** Quits: arrowd (~arr@78.107.6.128) ()
[23:33:49] <drsooch[m]> mpickering: attempting yes, mostly cleaning up libraries that donâ€™t have updates on head.hackage so far.
[23:34:03] <mpickering> will you put the head.hackage patches up?
[23:34:28] <drsooch[m]> Itâ€™s probably a pointless exercise that may not go anywhere but Iâ€™m enjoying digging into the API changes with GHC
[23:34:28] <mpickering> around start of April I will be able to help
[23:34:41] <mpickering> in a more hands on way anyway
[23:35:00] <drsooch[m]> I can take a look at the steps tonight to push to head.hackage
[23:35:26] <mpickering> how did you patch things?
[23:35:31] <mpickering> there is a tool you can use
[23:35:37] <mpickering> ./scripts/patch-tool
[23:35:45] <mpickering> which makes it easy to write patches
[23:36:42] <drsooch[m]> Iâ€™ve got a separate patch directory with all of the  libraries then I go in and make the changes manually.
[23:41:03] <mpickering> ok, I am sure you can work it out
[23:41:48] <pepeiborra> @wz1000 is there any chance that you or mpickering can take a look at https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server/issues/2693 before the release?
