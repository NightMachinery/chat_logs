[03:11:30] <gwern> rmmh: very nice. I guess the cat doesn't get bored with it, like watching birds out a cat flap
[03:12:04] <rmmh> who doesn't love a fish cupola?
[03:13:28] <gwern> rmmh: it's just that it's hard to predict what cats will get bored with. oolong has yet to tire of watching birds out his cat flap, but he got tired of videos for cats after a month or so
[03:13:48] <gwern> he doesn't interact with the birds (usually), so why is the screen so much worse?
[03:14:35] <rmmh> felines failing at suspension of disbelief? RGB screens not well matched for feline visual spectrums and acuity? 
[03:15:29] <rmmh> someone in my neighborhood always leaves their garage door 2' open so their monstrous orange tabby can glare at passing cars. It cracks me up; I should grab a photo sometime. 
[03:16:27] <gwern> they have shit color vision, so the RGB is not the problem. their flicker fusion isn't *that* high, and they definitely seem to see movement or else videos-for-cats wouldn't interest them at all
[03:16:59] <gwern> they're optimize for low-light levels, but of course that's no issue here, screens are sure bright enough
[03:18:44] <gwern> it could be some combination of refresh rate + resolution, but my suspicion is that screen just doesn't have the occasional rewards - after all, as ambush predators, cats are very patient and accustomed to waiting days or weeks for a successful hunt outcome, so maybe oolong jumping out the window once a month to rush some birds is in fact enough to make window-watching exciting
[03:19:09] <gwern> fully indoor cats, who have literally never hunted a real bird, might find screens a lot more exciting
[03:19:26] <quanticle> Yeah, I wonder the same thing about the fish tank
[03:19:49] <saturn2> the screen isn't 3D
[03:19:49] <quanticle> Sure that cat find it exciting to look at fish it'll never be able to catch, but would Ooolong?
[03:22:51] <gwern> saturn2: more plausible but again why would a cat a priori care? it is fully able to recognize and view a 2D screen. because it has experience with *real* prey and can see the missing 3D on the fake screen prey?
[03:23:53] <saturn2> i would guess a large part of the "fun" is continually calculating whether the prey is within lunging range
[03:24:06] <quanticle> The 2D screen is missing the ineffable qualia of real prey
[03:24:42] <gwern> you can judge distance with 2D
[03:26:33] <Betawolf> but you can't taste the fear in only two dimensions

[05:09:37] <nshepperd2> most people in the 1950s didn't know they *could* transition
[05:10:03] <adiabatic> yeah, back in the 50s, there was, like, one guy
[05:10:13] <adiabatic> dunno how well he passed
[05:10:21] <rmmh> Back in the 50s there were just crossdressers 
[05:11:29] <gwern> mccloskey didn't decide until 1995. I'm pretty sure he heard of the whole thing before that
[05:12:05] <nshepperd2> yeah, 'heard of the whole thing' in the sense of being told by everyone that transitioning equalled being a fetishized drag queen
[05:12:48] <adiabatic> presumably one could imagine transitioning, but not dressing in overly showy womens' clothing
[05:12:49] <nshepperd2> the idea that you can actually transition and then just be a normal man/woman
[05:13:02] <adiabatic> mccloskey's a smart guy, he could have thought that up
[05:13:03] <nshepperd2> is not something that has penetrated the public consciousness until extremely recently

[05:38:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Because logically the latter is entirely compatible with heterosexuality, right?)
[05:39:15] <nshepperd2> ...is it?

[05:47:50] <gwern> oh, androgen insensitivity. eh. that's not as clean a counterfactual.
[05:47:59] <nshepperd2> or just knocking out the SRY gene i suppose
[05:48:51] <gwern> most of these disorders have a number of other effects or inconsistencies or incompleteness. just the frequency of infertility tells you that they aren't *exactly* the same as being a normal XX woman
[05:49:15] <rmmh> gwern: lyonization means X chromosome "dosage" is constant in men and women
[05:49:20] <gwern> and of course, we know that many of these sorts of rare disorders involving genes affect facial appearance
[05:49:40] <gwern> so it's entirely possible that a CAIS person does *not* look identical to if they had been XX

[05:52:31] <rmmh> naively that seems harder than for Caucasian populations
[05:52:51] <gwern> it's a testable claim. once the face predictors arrive, run them on CAIS etc, and see how much and whether systematically they diverge from the doubled-X prediction
[05:54:02] <gwern> rmmh: uighurs might be easier. one of the rationales used in papers on uighur genetics is that as a population admixed between caucasian/central asian and east asia, they have relatively extreme genetic differences compared to a much more homogenous population like han chinese
[05:54:26] <gwern> 'oh, we just happen to be studying uighur DNA because the admixture studies are so powerful and interesting!'
[05:54:35] <rmmh> I suspect that the distances between face latent vectors are much smaller for Han Chinese than Caucasian, which is smaller than African 
[05:54:49] <rmmh> from a simple homozygosity standpoint 
[05:55:09] <gwern> oh sure, but never say that publicly because you'll sound like a racist saying 'those slanteyes all look the same'
[05:56:16] <gwern> anyway, there are a lot of ways to use a face predictor that people would be very uncomfortable with, of which embryo selection and chinese totalitarianism are but two, and I'm amused to add to the list that's merely weird

[07:25:30] <rmmh> milked in the morning, used through the day, basically rancid by the night

[10:27:40] <quanticle> ardent[m]: Isn't the usual argument that the world has far too much regard for disgust norms, as evidenced by the ease with which bioethicists can convince people to oppose new medical treatments (especially ones that involve genetic manipulation)?
[10:28:06] <quanticle> You're going to have to do some work to convince me that we're not caring enough about other people's disgust norms.
[10:28:09] <ardent[m]> Yes, that's exactly what I'm saying, sorry if the double/tripe negative confused
[10:28:14] <quanticle> Ah, okay.
[10:28:16] <ardent[m]> triple*
[10:28:23] <quanticle> Yes, I misinterpreted your statement, then.
[10:28:51] <ardent[m]> basically I'm saying that I see the opposite errancy all the time and very rarely see too much disregard in practice
[10:29:16] <ardent[m]> and when all the errors I see are in one direction it tends to scream "GRADIENT IS THIS WAY" away from them
[10:29:40] <quanticle> Oh yeah, gwern's been banging that drum for a long time now.
[10:30:15] <ardent[m]> it's kinda like I regret doing things about twice and not doing things some hundreds of times
[10:30:20] <quanticle> Like, if you find a promising medical treatment and the only arguments against it come from bioethicists, then it's probably actually really great.
[10:30:57] <ardent[m]> and that kind of mismatch either says that doing thing has long-tail safety risk (possibly true) or that my default is tuned way too much towards saying no (probably true)

[10:35:49] <ardent[m]> also sometimes I forget this isn't the Slate Star Discord where I'm a very known quantity for arguing strongly against disgust-based norms, so maybe I've gotten into a bit of a habit of not checking the scrutability of multiple-negatives with regards to those kinds of topics

[10:46:31] <PlanckWalk> Heh, I was confused by the ambiguous negatives too
[10:47:48] <PlanckWalk> Usually people use the phrase "near-unhealthy" to mean something *bad*
[10:47:49] <PapuaHardyNet> chaining multiple-negatives is usually a bad idea if you want to be understood
[10:48:17] <PapuaHardyNet> relying on cultural context to make it clear doesn't change the fact that using multiple negatives is a bad idea
[10:48:34] <PlanckWalk> So it sounded like "a certain near-unhealthy level of disregard for disgust norms" was referring to something bad.

[10:48:51] <PlanckWalk> But then followed up with "... that is sorely lacking in the world in general"
[10:50:11] <PlanckWalk> But yeah, now I see "near-unhealthy" as meaning more like "almost as far away from digust norms as you can get while remaining healthy"
[10:51:15] <kuudes> hmm, do I understand it correct that there are either ground stations or users of starlink up to 70 degrees north in alaska? that sounds promising to finland then as well
[10:51:23] <PlanckWalk> Rather than "dangerously close to unhealthy"
[10:51:39] <PapuaHardyNet> kuudes: this is so cool
[10:51:50] <ardent[m]> yes I do mean people are unhealthy in one direction far more than the other, and this is a big sign that things lean too far in that way overall

[10:53:27] <PapuaHardyNet> what's with that triangle of satellites near south of Australia though
[10:53:27] <kuudes> they are like 3000 km long lines over earth
[10:53:42] <kuudes> two waves of new satellites, I think
[10:53:44] <PapuaHardyNet> seems like a waste to keep so many of them so close to each other in a weird shape

[11:00:23] <kuudes> so mainly the current satellites are the ones who run between +-60 degrees
[11:00:44] <quanticle> Most of them are fairly evenly distributed, but there's a cluster at high altitude that represents the Beidou constellation.
[11:00:58] <kuudes> hmm, or I guess +-50 degrees even

[11:11:35] <quanticle> But from what I'm reading on Wikipedia, they're launching a global positioning system of their own too.

[11:13:11] <quanticle> The one advantage of the Russian GLONASS is that it has better coverage at high latitudes than GPS. Also, the hardware for it is pretty cheap, to the point where a lot of so-called GPS devices are actually GPS+GLONASS devices. My Garmin running watch, for example, allows you to select GPS only or GPS+GLONASS.

[12:45:58] <PapuaHardyNet> sounds like sensible thing imo
[12:52:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> One of the many things that annoys me about recipe sites like Serious Eats is how they will casually include "one vanilla bean, split lengthwise" in like every dessert recipe ever
[12:52:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> Despite the fact that vanilla beans are still ridiculously expensive
[12:52:41] <Obormot\Arcturus> No attempt to suggest a substitution either
[12:53:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> There's perfectly good vanilla extract... ok, it's going to taste *slightly less amazing* (to other people, not to me, but yes)
[12:53:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> Of course the writers of these recipes don't have to worry about this sort of thing!
[12:53:30] <Obormot\Arcturus> But some people do...
[12:53:33] <PapuaHardyNet> signalling that serious eats is for elites
[13:00:36] <Obormot\Gaia> Meanwhile. I am reading a fascinating little sf anthology called "American Science Fiction 1953–1956" - four novels from those years, each selected because it was, at the time, somehow unusual, groundbreaking, novel, etc. (this is apparently the first of two or three volumes, each covering a similar span of years, but the library only had this one)
[13:01:04] <Obormot\Gaia> One is Leigh Brackett's _The Long Tomorrow_, which I've read before and have commented on here
[13:02:21] <Obormot\Gaia> One is Frederik Pohl and C. M. Kornbluth's _The Space Merchants_, which is (rightly!) famous, lives up to everything I'd heard about it and more, and ... really there's not much for me to say about it that you won't find in any review, this is one of the most well-known sf works of the era
[13:02:51] <Obormot\Gaia> (But I will suggest reading the WP page on C. M. Kornbluth, the dude was, uh... quite a character)
[13:03:53] <Obormot\Gaia> One is Theodore Sturgeon's _More Than Human_, which was an interesting read but ultimately its appeal was subverted by the ending, in a way I'll perhaps comment on later
[13:04:10] <Obormot\Gaia> And one is Richard Matheson's _The Shrinking Man_, which I am still reading
[13:04:15] <Obormot\Gaia> About the last:
[13:06:20] <Obormot\Gaia> 1. Fascinating tidbit: the main character, who is some kind of working class guy (not sure what his profession is exactly but it's something blue-collar, I think), comes to the East Coast from the Midwest, with his family, to build a career (he starts out working for his brother's company) and a life... so we get a mention of how establishing themselves in the new place was expensive, because he had to buy a house, a car,
[13:06:20] <Obormot\Gaia>  clothes... clothes!! They're repeatedly mentioned, mind you, as a major expense, on par with a house and a car!
[13:06:46] <Obormot\Gaia> I thought immediately about gwern's page on life improvements... who would think to write such a thing today?
[13:07:22] <Obormot\Gaia> Buy a car - yeah, major expense. Buy a house - hah, don't be ridiculous, that's for rich people, no working stiff just come to the big city could imagine buying a *house*
[13:07:28] <Obormot\Gaia> But clothes? Clothes is nothing
[13:07:40] <Obormot\Gaia> But in the 50s... it was not nothing
[13:09:20] <rsaarelm> Oh huh, I read More Than Human in the 90s but didn't remember the ending at all.
[13:09:46] <Obormot\Gaia> 2. So the main plot point is that the guy gets bitten by a radioactive spider or w/e (not actually that, just, you know, "an unexplained science-fictional magic event that causes the protagonist to spontaneously develop inexplicable science-fictional-magic properties") and he starts slowly shrinking. Seems like a silly premise but Matheson takes it in some very not-silly directions... anyway, so of course the guy is like "oh
[13:09:46] <Obormot\Gaia>  god wtf" and he goes to doctors and stuff to figure out wtf 
[13:09:48] <Obormot\Gaia> And...
[13:10:24] <Obormot\Gaia> - and this is a major plot point, mind you, that affects all the characters' actions and decisions -
[13:10:35] <Obormot\Gaia> - he can't afford it.
[13:10:43] <Obormot\Gaia> The medical care! The tests! He can't afford them!
[13:10:57] <Obormot\Gaia> Because he doesn't have health insurance. He's poor! His family is on a tight budget!
[13:11:36] <Obormot\Gaia> At one point it's like "yeah I asked the doctors if they'd do the tests for free, on account of they're so excited to see this amazing novel phenomena, and they looked at me like I insulted their mother"

[14:41:19] <feep[work]> okay, they're arguing there's fundamentally two mechanisms for interacting with tasks, which are "proactive" - active control over tasks as they're queued for execution - and "reactive" - hindsight oversight over tasks as they're being performed
[14:41:46] <feep[work]> proactive seems to be activated from uncertainty in task selection
[14:42:29] <feep[work]> and the prefrontal cortex p much only does proactive control
[14:42:51] <feep[work]> ie. this is eager checking vs lazy checking
[14:43:52] <feep[work]> I'd guess the model here is that the brain normally operates in a "flow state" - where it just does its tasks with little competition for what comes next - but if nothing to do next comes to mind, or an error occurs, the brain kicks itself over into active checking
[14:44:46] <feep[work]> the obvious take here is "proactive control = self-awareness"
[14:45:14] <feep[work]> not sure if that mapping holds up, but it seems to match my self-experience
[14:46:41] <feep[work]> anyway this is pretty cool
[14:47:14] <feep[work]> it also explains why you can do the wrong thing out of habit
[14:47:22] <feep[work]> no context cues in the reactive system

[16:52:56] <kuudes> over here there are two different dimensions for education; specific named courses which the degree must hold, and minimum amount of study work the degree must hold
[16:53:18] <kuudes> this holds to at least secondary and tertiary
[16:54:05] <kuudes> so you have things like "at least math courses 1,2,3 and chem courses 1, ... total amount of courses must be at least 75"
[16:54:26] <kuudes> so there is sort of menu you can choose your courses from
[16:55:15] <kuudes> and there is minimum mandatory skeleton of choices, but then you are free to pick the rest of the degree from the menu
[16:56:47] <kuudes> with tertiary this is a more pronounced thing, as indeed the faculty decides what previous proven learning can be used to show what mandatory requirements, thereby reducing the mandatory requirements, but the study work amount, ie how many courses, ects one must show as new learning, is constant
[16:58:07] <kuudes> so a degree tells the person has some specific knowledge and also that they have managed to pass at least X amount of ects of academic work

[17:13:06] <Gurkenglas> (by discontinuity i mean, a small change in seat distribution outcomes that would cause a large change in policy)
[17:15:38] <kuudes> isn't the whole point of government being that a small change in seats inflicts a large change of policy?
[17:15:50] <kuudes> I mean, otherwise the thing is something like free market or whatever
[17:17:29] <Gurkenglas> It makes sense that some policy changes must happen all at once, because a compromise would be worse than either extreme. Is there a system that, *assuming* that all policies can gainfully be changed continuously, would do so?
[17:18:12] <kuudes> examples of preffered things?
[17:18:42] <pompolic> i've heard about belgium that it's big on compromise
[17:19:04] <pompolic> COVID-19 is probably one of the areas where a compromise between approaches is worse than extremes
[17:20:03] <pompolic> and this is just my subjective impression, but it feels like it contributes to the rampant schizophrenia about covid policy
[17:20:20] <pompolic> anyway, I'm not certain this is enough evidence to conclude that belgium is one such continuous system
[17:21:38] <Gurkenglas> kuudes, the archetypical discontinuity is when you have ~50% for the left and ~50% for the right and then swing voters decide which half of representatives is ignored
[17:22:35] <Gurkenglas> so i imagine the voting system would have to do something other than "spit out which half of representatives to ignore"
[17:23:01] <Gurkenglas> -voting
[17:24:34] <Gurkenglas> quadratic voting sounds like it's trying to address this issue, though its math doesn't look right
[17:25:27] <pompolic> also
[17:25:49] <pompolic> i thought of a joke answer but now i'm not sure it's a joke anymore... anarchy?
[17:26:48] <pompolic> i expect "policy" would be a function of who has the most people/resources/power, without the abstraction of representative democracy
[17:27:02] <Gurkenglas> then policy depends on what the strong think they can get away with before people band together for a lynching? i suppose that is continuous!

[17:28:13] <pompolic> Warlord Prediciton Markets here i come
[17:31:10] <PapuaHardyNet> I wonder if one can make microassassination markets
[17:32:01] <PapuaHardyNet> viably, I mean. and by microassassination, I obviously mean in the sense of "micromarriages" - fund legal or kind-of grey area or tiny illegal activities to the detriment of people
[17:33:10] <two2thehead> so how would you define microassassination?
[17:34:19] <bildramer> so like paid ddos services but for egging someone's house instead

[17:34:45] <two2thehead> yep

[19:00:47] <pompolic> crime uniqueness?
[19:01:18] <pompolic> like, they have heuristics for what criminal behavior looks like
[19:03:39] <pompolic> and i think my intuition says that it's easier to develop/deploy heuristics for microcrimes as opposed to things like being a serial killer, which is probably pretty complex
[19:03:54] <pompolic> i do not really have domain experience

[19:42:13] <pompolic> two2thehead: it occurs to me that i've been using IRC as my idea notepad for way too long
[19:42:30] <pompolic> this is suboptimal because the people living in the computer interfere with the thoughts
[19:43:07] <pompolic> or less jokingly, it's probably not a smart play to try to work things out in conversation
[19:44:03] <gwern> IRC is a fine place to start discussing ideas. just not a great place to end it.
[19:44:39] <pompolic> i have never had a discussion that ended
[19:45:04] * gwern notes https://www.gwern.net/Backstop#internet-community-design https://www.gwern.net/Epigrams#fn4
[19:45:04] <Robomot> Epigrams · Gwern.net [One of the most frequent failings of hackers is the ‘90% problem’: hacking on a project to 90% completion, then, the novelty over, abandoning it before doing the relatively modest amount of work (often typically just writing some documentation or a blog post explaining even what it is & showing off a few examples). Once stopped, one typically never resumes. This is particularly …]
[19:45:04] <Robomot> Evolution as Backstop for Reinforcement Learning · Gwern.net [Internet Community Design Internet community architecture can be seen as a bi-level optimization design too. There are fast and slow methods of interaction, and ideas or knowledge (or just ‘memes’) are created, varied, and selected on. These interactions happen inside discrete communities which are themselves created, varied, and grow. So, they …]
[19:45:20] <gwern> of course you have. every discussion but this one has ended. 'Arrakis teaches the teaching of the knife...'
[19:46:09] <pompolic> fair enough, although what i was alluding to is this particular failure mode of interminable circular conversations
[19:46:48] * gwern taps the rule-of-three sign
[19:47:33] <pompolic> another angle: for path-dependent reasons i avoided writing things down but for IRC. i think over time this produced resemblance to someone from an oral culture
[19:47:46] <pompolic> i predict that people younger than me have this problem worse
[19:47:59] <pompolic> what's the relevance of rule of three here?
[19:51:09] <phill> pompolic: on discord you can usually tell former IRC users by the pacing of their messages
[19:51:14] <phill> it's pretty weird
[19:51:35] <pompolic> oh? in what way does it differ?
[19:53:28] <pompolic> i now understand what the relevance of rule of three is
[19:53:38] <phill> usually shorter but more frequent....and they'll correct their previous errors using another line
[19:53:50] <phill> (instead of using the edit function, for example)
[19:54:47] <pompolic> that makes sense, although i'm still surprised at higher frequency
[19:54:57] <phill> i've found native discord users either don't use the edit function or use it, but if you usually provide corrections in a new message that's a pretty specific symptom
[19:55:12] <pompolic> yep lol
[19:55:40] <pompolic> and, i would argue, saner
[19:55:40] <PapuaHardyNet> see anyone doing it on discord? call them a boomer and the situation will resolve itself quick
[19:56:00] <pompolic> people are already too accustomed to their client rewriting their history on other people's command
[19:56:04] <pompolic> this is very evil
[19:56:10] <pompolic> even Matrix does it
[19:56:19] <pompolic> s/Matrix/element
[19:56:32] <PapuaHardyNet> what? matrix is the protocol, you got it right the first time
[19:57:01] <pompolic> you're right, but i think the clients can choose to just display edit events
[19:57:14] <pompolic> sort of. redacted messages will probably not be re-sent
[20:00:21] <phill> pompolic: yeah irc users tend to send like incomplete thoughts as they arise
[20:01:01] <pompolic> i have this bug
[20:01:32] <phill> (the "oral culture" comment reminded me of it)

[20:22:38] <gwern> if only because everyone is on drugs already. caffeine etc
[20:23:17] <kiboneu> being alive in meatspace is a drug to cyberspace
[20:23:47] <Betawolf> you mean being alive is a gateway drug for being on IRC?
[20:24:03] <Betawolf> (not a very effective one, it seems)
[20:24:38] <kiboneu> not really. i mean, relatively to each other in cyberspace, we're on drugs, by virtue of being alive and affected by the environment in meatspace
[20:25:13] <kiboneu> i.e. melatonin production is disrupted because of lights. stuff in the water and in the air

[20:29:27] <kiboneu> and it's happening on a global scale, popping through cyberspace portals to topologically disparate points in meatspace
[20:29:53] <kiboneu> i feel unwell
[20:29:57] <PapuaHardyNet> look, if you are on drugs, we get it
[20:30:21] <PapuaHardyNet> you don't have to write an explanation about why it is normal to be high on an IRC
[20:31:35] <kiboneu> i'm not high today, as it turns out
[20:34:34] <pompolic> i think drugs are a misleading frame and altered states of consciousness would probably be a better one for analysis

[21:11:03] <pompolic> looking forward to adversarially attacking the AI with shitposts
[21:11:11] <feep> otoh, an ai constructed on this may be "legible by default"
[21:11:16] <gwern> so the baseline models are all 'close' in some absolute sense, so the log-law scaling predicts that we can't be too far off
[21:11:37] <gwern> at least in an absolute sense of 'requiring billions or trillions as opposed to quadrillions upon quadrillions'
[21:12:50] <feep> I'd still expect explicit reasoning models to be inherently easier to scale to larger problems
[21:12:59] <feep> in a way that goes beyond scale

Notably, chain of thought prompting does better than standard prompting only at the scale of ∼100B parameters; models of smaller scale produced fluent but illogical chains of thought, leading to lower performance than standard prompting'

Several thousand people have changed careers based on our advice, and one of them has already become a billionaire who has pledged his wealth to helping solve global problems, and is also probably the world’s richest person under 30. Sam Bankman-Fried is extremely talented
