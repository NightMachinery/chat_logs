[00:56:00] <DoctorD90> hello! I have a question. I remember I can setup the "shell" to auto logout the user after the login. My scope is to allow the login, run a command on login (example a simple "echo $timestamp >> file") and force the user to logout. what is the correct setting? noshell ?
[00:56:34] <greycat> The correct approach would be to write a script that performs the action you want (echoing a message, for instance), and use that *AS* the user's login shell in passwd(5).
[00:56:46] <greycat> e.g. change /bin/sh  to  /usr/local/bin/goaway
[00:58:26] <DoctorD90> thanks greycat as usual. So instead to setup /usr/sbin/nologin (i remembered one of possible option), I can easly setup the script I want. Once runned the connection will be forced to be closed?

[01:06:44] <greycat> when the user's login shell exits, the connection is dropped, yes.  if their login shell is an actual shell, this happens when the user types 'exit' or 'logout' or Ctrl-D or whatever.  in the case of a script, it happens when the script exits.

[02:28:31] <sney> no it's just scanning your hardware and matching it to a database, it'll end with a report that tells you what you might need 
[02:29:00] <Ares000> and how do I use it?
[02:29:52] *** Joins: lukedashjr (~luke-jr@user/luke-jr)
[02:29:56] <greycat> the "GUI popup" phrase concerns me a bit... how is that going to work if the whole problem is that the GUI can't run
[02:30:18] <sney> "gui popup" is a function of the isenkramd daemon that monitors for new hardware 
[02:30:28] <sney> isenkram-lookup is a python script 
[02:30:32] <greycat> is there a command-line version?
[02:30:44] <sney> you use it by running 'isenkram-lookup' and then just wait for the output

[05:26:38] <somiaj> !non-free
[05:26:38] <dpkg> [non-free] a component which contains software that does not comply with the <DFSG>.  To add non-free packages to your packages index, ask me about <non-free sources>.  To see which non-free packages are installed ask me about <non-free list>.
[05:26:49] <somiaj> you can enable non-free, then apt install firmare-amd-graphics (that should work for most amd cards)
[05:29:07] <Ares000> is not working
[05:29:42] <Ares000> i enabled testing and is not doing anything, but it can ping google at 8.8.8.8
[05:30:03] <somiaj> what do you mean enabled testing? Are you mixing stable and testing?
[05:31:25] <Ares000> i tried to get the latest kernel with drivers but is not upgrading to it
[05:31:37] <Ares000> it says is up to date but nothing else
[05:31:51] <somiaj> that is because you haven't fully upgraded to testing, you don't mix stable and testing.
[05:32:15] <Ares000> i tried but is not upgrading to it
[05:32:21] <Ares000> is strange
[05:32:38] <somiaj> well now that you have started mixing things you are in a worse situation than you started in. Is this a fresh install?
[05:32:52] <Ares000> is a fresh install
[05:33:00] <somiaj> Is this for a desktop?
[05:33:13] <Ares000> laptop
[05:33:39] <somiaj> well not a server, okay. Does this laptop have pure amd gpu, or is it some intel/amd mix (those exist but are rare)
[05:34:07] <Ares000> i think is all amd
[05:34:32] <Ares000> is asus vivoBook
[05:34:35] <Ares000> 15
[05:34:49] <somiaj> well my suggestion at this point, since the release of bullseye is so close, is to use the testing installer to install bullseye
[05:34:58] <somiaj> is this a very new laptop (made in the last 6 months?)
[05:35:46] <Ares000> is quite new but i have it over 1 year
[05:36:22] <Ares000> model x512D
[05:37:37] <somiaj> well my suggestion since this is a fresh install is to just start over
[05:37:50] <Ares000> i did it 3 times
[05:37:58] <somiaj> https://cdimage.debian.org/cdimage/unofficial/non-free/images-including-firmware/bullseye_di_rc3+nonfree/amd64/iso-cd/firmware-bullseye-DI-rc3-amd64-netinst.iso -- there is an unoffical installer with non-free firmware (only unoffical because it contains non-free firmware)
[05:38:13] <somiaj> that should allow you to install the firmware you need provided the bullseye kernel supports your hardware

[09:10:15] <maxtimbo> i guess let's focus on smartmontools and how can I get ahead of disk failures
[09:13:23] <PMT> Shrug. My general philosophy is to have backups, use redundant configurations if you need that kind of resiliency, and replace disks when you start getting errors out of them. If you can afford to proactively replace disks just because SMART counters tick into a range that the drive reports as abnormal, and you really want to, go for it, but trying to do anything cleverer than all-or-nothing is probably a 
[09:13:29] <PMT> deep timesink with not enough benefit.
[09:14:26] <PMT> But keep in mind that a number of drives fail with little to no prior warning, so all your proactive monitoring won't save you from the need to plan for and handle sudden failures.
[09:15:48] <maxtimbo> i was thinking i'd clone these two machines anyways and have a backup ready. that's pretty good advice. I am one of those who have had catastrophic disk failure

[12:57:25] <Khepra> "nobody" is special in that it's used in circumstances where you want a non-persistent unprivileged user. the whole concept relies on sharing nothing between... contexts.... that utilize nobody. if you chown, you've broken that concept by persisting

[13:23:44] <dob1> Khepra, but the cron job is */5 * * * *     munin if [ -x /usr/bin/munin-cron ]; then /usr/bin/munin-cron; fi   so it runs as munin user,  how do it switch to other user while running ? is munin suid ?

[13:26:26] <Khepra> PMT: about what?
[13:26:42] <PMT> That cronjob is indeed in the Debian munin.
[13:27:04] <Khepra> yes, I was looking at the wrong thing. munin is separated between master and node items, I was looking through the node
[13:27:40] <dob1> so the question remains, if the cron job is run as munin user, how it runs plugins where you define user root ?

[13:30:56] <Khepra> Khepra: and btw, you mentioned /usr/share/munin/munin-update. I misread that as you trying to run a node update run. munin-update is also a master process that doesn't run as root, but note it's a master process that contacts nodes, ie. doesn't run local plugins
[13:31:12] <Khepra> (unless indirectly through a localhost munin-node)

[13:36:01] <Khepra> no, just run /usr/share/munin/munin-update as user "munin"

[13:39:40] <Khepra> dob1: "define doesn't update" or what precisely you expect would happen?
[13:39:59] <dob1> the Last update on bottom right it's the same as the last cron run
[13:40:18] <Khepra> because the HTML are created by the munin-html subprocess invoked from munin-cron
[13:40:33] <dob1> and why they are not created?
[13:40:39] <Khepra> that's teh part about "full cycle" I mentioned earlier, if you want to force node updates, limits, HTML and graphing, you must run the whole shebang, munin-cron

[21:55:59] <rendar> sad.
[21:56:21] <PMT> Aw. That'll teach me not to notice sid isn't newer before asking.
[21:57:06] <somiaj> !slushy
[21:57:06] <dpkg> When a <testing> release becomes frozen, <unstable> tends to partially freeze as well.  This is because developers are reluctant to upload radically new software to unstable, in case the frozen software in testing needs minor updates and to fix release critical bugs which keep testing from becoming <stable>.
[21:57:14] *** Quits: drupin (9839315e@67.205.143.82) (Quit: The Lounge - https://thelounge.chat)
[21:57:26] <ede> > sid: 3.38.1-1; experimental: 40.1-1
[21:57:28] <rendar> PMT: so, i can't install gedit sid's version, right?
[21:57:29] <ede> something missing?
[21:57:42] <PMT> rendar: that would be a colossally bad idea.
[21:57:51] <rendar> :(
[21:57:53] <rendar> that's sad
[21:58:10] <somiaj> anyways, usually testing/sid are close, even during the freeze
[21:58:15] <PMT> Well, sid's package would be a colossally bad idea. Sid's version backported along with dependencies would probably be a bunch of work but might not be infeasible.
[21:58:30] <rendar> why debian has so old packages? and.. do they become older and older? i mean, debian can't keep up to check more and more software?
[21:58:50] <somiaj> rendar: you can upgrade to bullseye now if you want to get a jump start. Outside of no security support until the actual release, it is basically ready.
[21:59:16] <somiaj> rendar: Debian's release are frozen, that means the version at the release is the version that is avaialbe for the lifetime of the release.
[21:59:31] <rendar> somiaj: i have to upgrade an entire distro for a gedit 'async' syntax highlight? LOL.
[21:59:39] <somiaj> rendar: Buster started to freeze in the end of 2018, so basically most software in buster is 2018 (maybe early 2019 depending on the matainer)
[21:59:50] <rendar> somiaj: like Apple, cool
[21:59:52] <ede> rendar: when was it introduced, in what version?
[22:00:04] *** Quits: peterz (~quassel@j217100.upc-j.chello.nl) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[22:00:18] <rendar> ede: python supports that keyword since 2015
[22:00:32] <somiaj> rendar: you could backport it yourself, but this will require backporting a few libaries, and knowing how to build software. If running a desktop you maybe wanting to update to bullseye anyways since it will contain newer software all around.
[22:00:47] <ede> rendar: gedit
[22:00:59] <ede> since this isn't about python
[22:00:59] <rendar> i know how to build software but i don't want to lose 1 hr of my life! would be quicker to use another editor
[22:01:05] <somiaj> If this is just a gedit plugin, maybe you can just update the plugin locally (in your $HOME) to have more modern systnax hilgihthing.
[22:01:06] <rendar> ede: i don't know of course
[22:01:48] <ede> rendar: so if it was just one week after debian stopped introducing new software into then-not-yet-buster it's just bad timing
[22:01:55] *** Joins: mbrad (~mbrad@176.252.84.38)
[22:02:02] <somiaj> There are lots of advantages to frozen systems, like Debian's stable release, but one of drawbacks is learning how to deal with software if you want a newer version than the one provided.
[22:02:43] <rendar> frozen system means that if gedit will have a new version, i can get that only with the debian next distro release?
[22:02:48] <rendar> what about security?!
[22:02:48] <somiaj> And a lot depends on the matainer of the package, it takes work to get things into Debian, so just because upstream release was before the freeze, the matainer may not have the time to ensure it gets into the release.
[22:03:03] <ede> tbh looking at what gnome software brings with it when installing i wouldn't touch it with a pole once it shows a consistent behaviour with the installed versions
[22:03:04] <rendar> what about gedit 3.30 has a severe security bug?
[22:03:12] <somiaj> rendar: Security fixes are all backported to the version in the stable release (same with any bug fixes applied to the stable release)
[22:03:35] <somiaj> rendar: they will then make a targeted fix against the 3.30 version that fixes that bug.
[22:03:59] <rendar> somiaj: ok but when? months after? or quickly?
[22:03:59] <somiaj> They will make sure any fixes only target the bug and will not intrudoce new features (or change existing features)
[22:04:26] <somiaj> It veraries, depending on the bug, how sever it is, how long it takes the security team to backport a fix, etc
[22:04:31] <rendar> i want to understand if this debian version system can also affect system's security
[22:05:09] <somiaj> Debian security is reasonable quick on fixing security issues it deems widspread and sever enough. Though even if the fix is slow, it is always well documented.
[22:05:30] <ede> changes may break things, bugfixes are changes too but especially targeted against already broken things. even more for security bugs.
[22:05:43] <somiaj> Debian's security tracker will let you know exactly which security CVE's it has fixed, plans on fixing, or ignores. But the answer is it varries depending on the package, bug, and scope of the security issue.
[22:06:03] <ede> even on oldstable i got instant updates for security related issues
[22:06:05] <rendar> i see
[22:06:16] *** Quits: brachamh (~brachamh@user/brachamh) (Quit: ZNC 1.7.2+deb3 - https://znc.in)
[22:06:34] <rendar> but Ubuntu has the same package manager, but seems to upgrade/fix stuff a way more quickly, why is that?
[22:06:54] <ede> they go on sid
[22:07:06] *** Joins: Tokamak (~Tokamak@107.117.203.33)
[22:07:09] <rendar> uhm, i see
[22:07:14] <ede> also i'd say having Canonical in the background may be a difference
[22:07:15] <somiaj> https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-14108 -- for instance there is an old CVE the security team deemed negligiable
[22:07:23] *** Joins: brachamh (~brachamh@user/brachamh)
[22:07:34] <somiaj> So debian may not fix every secuirty bug, but they document the exact status for the user to decide what to do.
[22:08:07] <rendar> so, paradoxically speaking, sid would be unstable but more secure?
[22:08:16] <somiaj> rendar: Ubuntu has (a) a much faster release cycle, every 6 months (unless using LTS), (b) only mataines a very small set of packages (most things you install in ubuntu are not matained by ubuntu)
[22:08:31] <PMT> For what value of secure? "May crash unexpectedly, but has more known issues fixed" is not a pure win, IMO.
[22:08:35] <somiaj> rendar: so though the core doens't update that fast, the universe (which is mostly just untested sid packages) is updated regurally.
[22:08:55] <rendar> ok
[22:09:34] <rendar> bullseye is the next stable? and what is the middle way between stable and sid?
[22:09:35] <somiaj> rendar: sid is not concisered more secure than stable. It is often broken, buggy, and the security bugs that it has fixed that aren't fixed in stable are often either minor, don't make an inpact, only affect a very very small subset of users.
[22:10:09] <somiaj> There is testing (which is now bullseye), but testing has the slowest security support of all the debian development branches.
[22:10:28] <rendar> so the testing is the one more unsecure

[22:10:54] <somiaj> Also many security bugs are introduced in new features, so many security bugs will affect sid, but not affect stable, because the bug is in some new feature not present in the frozen version in stable.

[22:12:49] <somiaj> It is a hard balance, there are many who want frozen versions of software for much longer than a debian release (hence why LTS (5 years) and ELTS (up to 7 years) of support is offered for debian by third party companies
[22:12:55] *** MrSparkle is now known as MrBile
[22:13:39] <somiaj> every 2 years I think is a reasonable balance, though near the end of the release many users do wish their software was newer
