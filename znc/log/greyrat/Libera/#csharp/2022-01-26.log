[00:11:34] <MatthiasVance> I am still 100% sure it was due to that Cura plugin since I didn't have it happen afterwards

[00:12:00] <MatthiasVance> "send to octoprint" :P
[00:12:06] <GetShwifty> if we're printing rocket engines with 3d printers feel like yeah it could be feasible

[00:22:55] <MatthiasVance> Hm, that doesn't give me a clearer picture on what kind of data that would be :D
[00:23:51] <GetShwifty> it's not data, it's gibberish that you attempt to turn into data

[00:57:56] <xb0o2> It'd be more idiomatic C# that's for sure.

[01:03:57] <edcba> i'm hungry now :/
[01:04:57] <hseg> anyway, seems like the idiomatic way here would be to use a factory of visitors
[01:05:17] <xb0o2> Sounds like pattern soup
[01:05:20] <hseg> yup
[01:05:34] <hseg> and it wouldn't be anything better than what I have rn
[01:05:57] <hseg> since I'd _still_ have typecasing, only abstracted away in a factory
[01:06:01] <xb0o2> Sounds like what you have now and your proposed pattern soup might not be great options then
[01:06:26] <xb0o2> i.e. you're missing the right abstraction
[01:06:39] <hseg> sounds to me like the language is too constrained to express the abstraction I want
[01:07:16] <xb0o2> Well, the visitor pattern is the way to swing the needle to the other side of the expression problem what C# usually uses
[01:07:30] <hseg> ideally, would be able to have extension methods implement an interface
[01:07:50] <GetShwifty> huh
[01:08:11] <xb0o2> So if you're struggling with the C# approach, feel free to use the visitor pattern but appreciate it's pretty verbose
[01:08:12] <GetShwifty> what language lets a method implement a class contract?
[01:08:26] <GetShwifty> and how would that work lmao
[01:08:43] <xb0o2> GetShwifty: you can implement interfaces using methods in Go
[01:08:43] <hseg> my experience for that is Haskell's notion of orphan typeclass instances
[01:08:58] <JakeSays> hseg: you can create a composite type at runtime that would implement an interface. i've done that before
[01:09:09] <xb0o2> Not that it's particularly relevant in this case I suspect
[01:09:34] <hseg> where you can basically have class, interface and implementation all separate
[01:09:56] <hseg> JakeSays: which would involve changing the type passed to the use sites, no?
[01:10:13] <xb0o2> Haskell just takes the opposite side of the expression problem to C#, it's not magic
[01:10:13] <hseg> all of this is probably not worth the bother
[01:10:23] <JakeSays> hseg: yes, but that's easy enough to do
[01:10:24] <hseg> xb0o2: in what sense?
[01:10:30] <JakeSays> and low risk
[01:10:33] <hseg> JakeSays: clarify?
[01:10:54] <JakeSays> clarify which part?
[01:11:05] <GetShwifty> func (ms MyString) FindVowels() []rune {
[01:11:10] <GetShwifty> wow that is an annoyingly ugly syntax
[01:11:11] <hseg> how you'd use composite types here
[01:11:46] <xb0o2> In Haskell it's trivial to extend the behavior over a type (add a function), harder to extend the cases of a type (add a new variant). C# is the opposite (i.e. it's easy to add another implementation of an interface, harder to add a new method to an interface).
[01:12:03] <JakeSays> hseg: i'm not entirely sure. i just saw implementing interfaces and that ocurred to me. i'd need to know more about your issue.
[01:12:57] <GetShwifty> hah
[01:12:57] <JakeSays> but i've implemented interfaces at runtime that combined multiple class instances, where each class implemented a method on the interface
[01:13:14] <GetShwifty> go has a really simple / hard codedc automatic service registratation based upon parameter types
[01:13:21] <xb0o2> In C# if you want the Haskell-ish behaviour of exhaustive case checking (without relying on a type switch with a default), you have to use the visitor pattern.
[01:13:23] <GetShwifty> that's kind of interesting
[01:13:29] <JakeSays> but go sucks ass
[01:13:30] <hseg> JakeSays: basically need to add a .Render() method to a collection of types, without changing the types
[01:13:32] <xb0o2> It's more verbose because it's unidiomatic.
[01:13:51] <GetShwifty> the format is definitely ugly AF
[01:14:09] <GetShwifty> its like it's doing the same god damn thing every other language is doing synacticallybut decided to just be assininely different

[01:14:16] <hseg> xb0o2: fair cop re exprssion -- didn't notice haskell presumes OCP on its types
[01:14:16] <JakeSays> hseg: you could certainly do that with an interface
[01:14:37] <xb0o2> hseg: if you *cannot* modify the original type, you'll need to write adapters. That's C# life.
[01:15:01] <hseg> right, which changes the use sites
[01:15:11] <xb0o2> Yes but you'd still need to do the same in Haskell.
[01:15:17] <xb0o2> There's no free lunch here.
[01:15:28] <JakeSays> hseg: but you would have to change the usages, which, again, isn't a big deal
[01:15:31] <GetShwifty> actually we do a free lunch every weekday that ends in ay
[01:15:34] <xb0o2> Both languages need you to specify that operation X is a valid operation to perform on type T.
[01:15:45] <hseg> would only have had to change the couple use sites using the .Render operation
[01:15:56] <hseg> unless I'm misunderstanding something
[01:16:39] <xb0o2> Which is equivalent to changing those sites in C# if you used the visitor pattern.
[01:16:53] <hseg> hrm... unless you mean "wrap up your type in an adaptor when rendering, then unwrap when done"?
[01:17:12] <JakeSays> why would you unwrap?
[01:17:27] <GetShwifty> cause some people don't believe in 'wrapping before they tap'
[01:17:33] <JakeSays> xb0o2: visitor feels like overkill
[01:17:45] <xb0o2> In Haskell, if you wanted to pass *any* type that you can call Render on, you'd have to have a typeclass.
[01:17:46] <JakeSays> GetShwifty: dude you need to get laid
[01:17:51] <xb0o2> In C#, it's an interface.
[01:17:52] <hseg> because I'd want to keep the changes contained to those places that need .Render()
[01:18:20] <xb0o2> You couldn't 'wrap and unwrap' it in Haskell either.
[01:19:16] <hseg> hrm. _could_ if my wrapper was generic
[01:19:48] <JakeSays> hseg: seems like you could create an interface with Render() as an interface function
[01:19:49] <xb0o2> You can do that with an interface.
[01:20:26] <xb0o2> I'm not seeing how there's any different languages feature in Haskell that's preventing you from recreating the same solution to your problem in C#.
[01:20:54] <JakeSays> i'm not sure why haskell is even a part of the discussion:p
[01:21:06] <GetShwifty> because hes afraid of changing the usage sites
[01:21:09] <hseg> me complaining out of haskell envy
[01:21:15] <GetShwifty> but is willing to rewrite the whole thing in Haskell
[01:21:20] <hseg> oh hell no
[01:21:32] <GetShwifty> but failing to realize that he's going to be bitching about a different slew of problems in Haskell rewrite that aren't a problem in C# lmao
[01:21:43] <hseg> lol, fair nuff
[01:21:55] <GetShwifty> the theme is always darker/sharper in the other IDE/langauge
[01:22:01] <JakeSays> if haskell were so great then c# wouldn't exist :p
[01:22:18] <GetShwifty> Haskell and C# are really designed for two completely different sets of problems
[01:22:25] <GetShwifty> is the way i'd state that :-p
[01:22:33] <xb0o2> hseg: in Haskell, you'd be reliant on the typeclass at the call site right?
[01:22:43] <hseg> right
[01:22:49] <xb0o2> And somewhere there'd be an implementation of the typeclass for your specific type
[01:22:53] <hseg> yes
[01:22:54] <xb0o2> And then you'd have your specific type
[01:22:57] <hseg> yes
[01:23:04] <JakeSays> sounds like an interface to me
[01:23:07] <xb0o2> In C#, the call site relies on the interface
[01:23:13] <xb0o2> The specific type still exists
[01:23:33] <xb0o2> And either the specific type implements the interface or yes you have to write an adapter to implement the interface
[01:23:49] <hseg> yes yes. but making a type implement an interface doesn't require changing/adapting the type
[01:23:55] <JakeSays> or you use a default method on the interface
[01:23:58] <xb0o2> It's the same thing, just with potentially an intermediate type in C# if you for some reason cannot change the original type (e.g. it's in a library you don't control)
[01:24:06] <hseg> just that an implementation _exists_, somewhere
[01:24:11] <hseg> in the compilation unit
[01:24:39] <hseg> (these are called orphan instances in the haskell lingo)
[01:24:53] <JakeSays> well, a default method wouldn't work if you can't change the type
[01:25:08] <JakeSays> how many of these types are we talking about?
[01:25:08] <xb0o2> If you mentally equate writing a typeclass instance and either implementing an interface on a type (or writing an adapter that implements the interface), you're talking about the same thing
[01:25:47] <hseg> actually, that gives me an idea
[01:26:00] <JakeSays> hseg: how many types are there?
[01:26:06] <hseg> a dozen
[01:26:09] <JakeSays> ...
[01:26:11] <JakeSays> dude
[01:26:14] <GetShwifty> *stabs hseg*
[01:26:22] <xb0o2> Typeclasses -> interfaces is one of the easier translations of Haskell to Java, C# etc
[01:26:23] <JakeSays> you could've manually added the render method by now
[01:26:29] <hseg> yeah, fair
[01:26:53] <GetShwifty> hseg is buying Friday Donuts
[01:26:58] <JakeSays> hell you could've written a tool to add the method for you by now
[01:27:08] <xb0o2> And the visitor pattern is always there if you want to tackle the opposite side of the expression problem (i.e. the side Haskell takes)
[01:27:12] <GetShwifty> remember when VS had programmable macros?
[01:27:22] <GetShwifty> could you imagine if they kept that technology, enhanced it and mixed roslyn in with it
[01:27:31] <GetShwifty> instead of degrading the interface to the point where hitting the same but ton 30 times
[01:27:39] <GetShwifty> elicits a 10% success rate at bringing up intellisense suggestions
[01:27:48] <JakeSays> GetShwifty: yeah i wanted them to use csx as the scripting language
[01:28:09] <GetShwifty> think csx came out about the time they finally killed vs macros
[01:28:21] <GetShwifty> it got removed 2003/2005 right?
[01:28:23] <hseg> am still unsure Render should be part of the classes -- whatever happened to "dumb data, smart functions"?
[01:28:31] <JakeSays> no. they killed macros in vs 2010
[01:28:37] <JakeSays> roslyn wasn't for another 5'ish years
[01:28:48] <GetShwifty> oh okay
[01:28:53] <xb0o2> If you want dumb data, smart functions across multiple types with type safety in C#, you need the visitor pattern.
[01:28:56] <GetShwifty> yeah i know roslyn came much later
[01:29:34] <JakeSays> xb0o2: you are hung up on visitors:p
[01:29:35] <xb0o2> If your definition of dumb data is 'just a bag of properties', that is
[01:30:26] <xb0o2> JakeSays: I suspect we're talking about FP-related dumb data, smart functions though, in which case the visitor pattern is how you do it *extremely verbosely* with full type safety
[01:30:27] <hseg> which it basically is
[01:31:19] <xb0o2> Idiomatically you'd just implement the interface or write an adapter in 99.9% cases though
[01:31:50] <hseg> OK. Isn't that anti-SOLID, though?
[01:31:57] <xb0o2> No?

[01:32:37] <hseg> why does the class need to know about all my weird and wacky interfaces?
[01:32:54] <xb0o2> Why would they be weird and wacky?
[01:33:05] <GetShwifty> Weird Al is his Co-Pilot
[01:34:38] <hseg> disregard the "weird and wacky" then. why does the author of a class need to know of all the interfaces the users of that class will want it to implement?
[01:34:51] <GetShwifty> the poi9nt of the interface is so they dont?
[01:35:06] <JakeSays> hseg: that question doesn't make sense
[01:35:07] <xb0o2> Because that's the side of the expression problem C# landed on ;-)
[01:35:24] <JakeSays> hseg: the author of a class is the one who implements the interface, not the consumer
[01:35:36] <_genuser_> interface were created to create confusion and add complexity to code.
[01:35:37] <hseg> oh ffs, i'm going to have to unlearn a bunch of haskell, aren't i?
[01:35:48] <_genuser_> and so people can religiously chant "abstractions over concretions"
[01:35:57] <xb0o2> The author of the implementation class has to be aware of the interface.
[01:36:13] <xb0o2> (In C#, at least)
[01:36:24] <xb0o2> And if you're not the author of the implementation, you write an adapter.
[01:36:36] <xb0o2> Just the way it goes.
[01:36:43] <hseg> ugh. ok, ig
[01:37:11] <_genuser_> xb0o2 no way dude. if yo'ure not the author, you inherit and create a bastard lovechild.
[01:37:35] <_genuser_> and then mark your class sealed.
[01:37:37] <JakeSays> unless the author doesn't allow inheritance
[01:37:39] <hseg> so in any case, I'll need to bake in the implementation of the interface. oh well
[01:37:46] <xb0o2> No, I write an adapter because I don't use inheritance because I'm not a masochist ;)
[01:38:13] <_genuser_> hehe.
[01:38:18] <JakeSays> xb0o2: for 12 types i'd just add the interface/method
[01:38:31] <JakeSays> that doesn't involve inheritance
[01:38:35] <xb0o2> hseg: Is the interface realistically something that the implementing class should be aware of?
[01:38:47] <GetShwifty> do it explicitly
[01:38:52] <GetShwifty> that waythe class doesn't have to know about it
[01:38:53] <GetShwifty> :-D
[01:38:53] <xb0o2> If you're talking about, for example, a domain class and some kind of UI interface then write an adapter.
[01:39:14] <xb0o2> If the class and the interface are somewhat related, just implement it.
[01:39:30] <xb0o2> Insert caveats about what 'related' means yadda yadda
[01:39:36] <JakeSays> xb0o2: i get the feeling that the entire project is one bad design. adding adapters might be more trouble than benefit
[01:39:51] <GetShwifty> i feel like we could have rewritten his whole project in the time we've had this discussion
[01:39:52] <xb0o2> JakeSays: who knows, you may well be right
[01:40:03] <hseg> yeah, ok. probably best to just add the implementations
[01:41:14] <hseg> GetShwifty: we're talking a project in the 100's kloc
[01:41:24] <GetShwifty> twas a joke son
[01:41:25] <GetShwifty> lol
[01:41:36] <xb0o2> hseg: out of interest, what would this interface be?
[01:41:53] <GetShwifty> IAreWeRenderingAnyGoodPorn.AIDetect()
[01:43:08] <hseg> In this case, should be a pair of sth like GetXDataFromDB and RenderXData
[01:43:22] <JakeSays> i should be tracking down an alignment issue but i want to print!
[01:43:34] <JakeSays> hseg: ohh that's not solid for sure
[01:43:49] <xb0o2> Sounds like the whole problem stems from a bit of an odd abstraction
[01:45:07] <hseg> heh. yup. why the others decided to build this system without composing away the XData part is beyond me
[01:45:32] <GetShwifty> seems very WET
[01:45:45] <hseg> (the main problem now is that we're completely changing the XData format, so I need to be able to render both)
[01:46:05] <GetShwifty> sounds like a simple problem if implemented right lol
[01:46:33] <xb0o2> Does feel a bit like if the problem were split into two interfaces your life would be a lot easier
[01:46:47] <hseg> yup. it's a basic crm, how on earth did they mess it up so badly
[01:47:11] <GetShwifty> we all make bad choices, some people choose meth, others choose Jalapenjo Donuts
[01:47:20] <GetShwifty> the important thing is we get Non-Jalapenjo Donuts next Friday
[01:47:34] <hseg> xb0o2: probably. but trying to do that failed last week
[01:47:58] <GetShwifty> a CRM tbh can very simply be do this with one interface
[01:48:01] <GetShwifty> if designed right
[01:48:09] <GetShwifty> i actually just finikshed this weekend doing something similar lmao
[01:48:10] <xb0o2> IGetData<X> + IRender<X> doesn't seem like too much of a stretch

[01:49:07] <hseg> had an entire DI thing up there, it was a mess

[03:02:22] <GetShwifty> so install Pro+ if you don't want it
[03:02:44] <GetShwifty> honestly the bastardization / babyifing of the TAskbar on Windows 11 was the show stopper for me
[03:03:12] <Slade> JakeSays, eh?

[03:03:37] <GetShwifty> which is Pro+

[03:04:28] <Slade> actually hes completely incorrect since i was talking about my own experience. its good to know its not all editions experience tho
[03:04:31] <BtbN> Putting it offline works, and is how you get arround the MS account requirements.
[03:04:33] <BtbN> And still no ads
[03:04:34] <GetShwifty> then you had an internet conetion and setup a windows 11
[03:04:37] <JakeSays> i think you installed it figuratively
[03:04:37] <GetShwifty> because MS EXPLICITLY
[03:04:41] <GetShwifty> said that will NOT work
[03:04:43] <BtbN> Nope, you are just wrong.
[03:04:47] <GetShwifty> you mean
[03:04:47] <BtbN> Well, it does work.
[03:04:49] <GetShwifty> Microsoft is wrong
[03:04:53] <JakeSays> Slade: lol that was my point
[03:05:05] <GetShwifty> because Microsoft explicitly said Windows 11 Consumer Edition MANDATORILY requires Internet Connection AND a Microsoft Account

[03:05:14] <GetShwifty> so I'm not wrong
[03:05:16] <GetShwifty> Microsfot is wrong
[03:05:25] <GetShwifty> and you can go fight with MS about that lol
[03:05:52] <GetShwifty>     Windows 11 Home edition requires an Internet connection and a Microsoft Account to complete device setup on first use.

[04:16:54] <JakeSays> oh wait.. that wont work
[04:17:17] <JakeSays> Slade: get that transfer thing and a couple usba-usbc adapters
[04:17:43] <Slade> JakeSays, then its slow speed
[04:18:47] <JakeSays> Slade: you doing a lot of these upgrades?
[04:19:07] <JakeSays> Slade: https://amz.run/5Fyj
[04:19:08] <Slade> JakeSays, what do you mean? just transfering over 500gb
[04:19:27] <JakeSays> if you're doing that much then use ethernet
[04:19:37] <Slade> usbc is faster
[04:19:54] <Slade> usbc->usbc drive might be faster
[04:20:10] <JakeSays> i doubt that, unless you have ancient nic's
[04:20:22] <JakeSays> but that last link us usb 3
[04:20:24] <JakeSays> *is
[04:21:39] <Slade> JakeSays, usbc is up to 10gbps .. which is faster than my network

[04:24:49] <JakeSays> Slade: the spec is, but i'd be really surprised if reality was anywhere near that
[04:25:07] <JakeSays> but i dunno. i don't transfer much shit
[04:25:23] <Slade> JakeSays, transfering to my phone its really fast the bottleneck is storage device
[04:25:45] <lz_> so I thought about buying a real camera instead of a phone. turned out even fucking cameras are out of stock now
[04:25:47] <JakeSays> Slade: another option is to just mount machine b's drive in machine a and do the transfer
[04:26:20] <JakeSays> oops. i shouldn't say 'mount' around GetShwifty
[04:26:39] <Slade> JakeSays, yea some option. actually the problem seems to be windows.  both linux and apple let you do this
[04:27:18] <JakeSays> well duh
[04:27:44] <JakeSays> having two pixel phones is confusing me
[04:28:02] <Slade> my keyboard starting jaking up on my pixel :(
[04:28:06] <Slade> hah jaking up.. jacking up
[04:28:20] <JakeSays> LOL
[04:28:30] <JakeSays> which pixel do you have
[04:30:04] <GetShwifty> have the 4 5g version
[04:30:31] <GetShwifty> been meaning to do the aosp / lineagos but combination of not really thta brave and no real time
[04:30:49] <GetShwifty> really would like to find somebody locally that's done it lol and have them walk me through it
[04:36:07] <Slade> JakeSays, 5
[04:36:34] <Slade> sometimes the keyboard is shorter than normal, and sometimes it covers up the screen instead of slidding it up, and sometimes it wont appear until i force stop it
[04:36:39] <JakeSays> i have a 3xl and 6pro
[04:37:15] <JakeSays> i much prefer the body of the 3xl
[04:37:25] <JakeSays> the 6 is all glass, which is just fucking stupid
[04:37:58] <lz_> i found a used one, screen broken lol
[04:37:59] <lz_> fml
[04:38:21] <_genuser_> JakeSays I guess the body of the 3xl looks like a man's then....
[04:38:47] <JakeSays> _genuser_: you are more qualified to judge that than I
[04:38:55] <JakeSays> so i'll defer to you
[04:38:59] <_genuser_> JakeSays cool under pressure I see!
[04:39:12] <_genuser_> didn't even break a sweat returning the jab, heh.
[04:39:13] <JakeSays> coooooll
[04:39:32] <_genuser_> I _was_ gonna say cool as a cucumber, but I didn't wanna compound the situation.
[04:39:51] <JakeSays> yeah GetShwifty would get all excited
[04:40:26] <_genuser_> lol
[04:40:31] <GetShwifty> need to add some spring mix, tomatoe, avocado, grilled salmon, apple crips, to that cucumber to get me excitedd
[04:40:34] <_genuser_> so any of you use rope light before?
[04:40:47] <JakeSays> rope light?
[04:40:58] <GetShwifty> think bdsm?
[04:41:06] <GetShwifty> that's the vein thgat people were in?

[04:41:09] <JakeSays> that would be light rope
[04:41:27] <_genuser_> JakeSays mainly curious about brand recommendation. I saw some of them had reviews like, "cheap made in china, caught fire"
[04:41:29] <GetShwifty> oh wow _genuser_ you're kinky, tying your gf/bf/we up in led light
[04:41:32] <JakeSays> _genuser_: well, being an adult i would have to say no
[04:41:52] <JakeSays> _genuser_: however if i were wanting some, i'd make my own
[04:41:57] <_genuser_> both of you calm down.
[04:42:12] <_genuser_> I was actually thinking of accent lighting in the room. Soft white to bright white.
[04:42:21] <GetShwifty> you're the one talking about rope light,
[04:42:26] <GetShwifty> :-p
[04:42:37] <_genuser_> but sure if I was pumping adrenaline such when playing Age of Empires, I could see turning that to blue or something.
[04:42:42] <JakeSays> _genuser_: make your own - it's a lot of fun
[04:42:47] <GetShwifty> you're talking about rope light and i'm over here one-hand typing while tugging with my dog

[04:43:07] <GetShwifty> lol
[04:43:13] <_genuser_> JakeSays you mean find led lights and just string them together?
[04:43:32] <JakeSays> _genuser_: something like that
[04:43:53] <JakeSays> you can get ws2812b's in a string
[04:44:08] <JakeSays> then you can build a controller (like my clock)

[04:45:55] <JakeSays> _genuser_: actually more like this: https://amz.run/5Fyp
[04:47:25] <JakeSays> _genuser_: no, i picked the fairy string one because it fit you
[04:47:37] <_genuser_> "High failure rate from low-quality LEDs."
[04:47:44] <JakeSays> which one?
[04:47:49] <_genuser_> the fairy string one.

[04:48:34] <_genuser_> so basically, if you scroll down, click on the 1 star review line - then search comments - you can search for anything. I genreally search for fire and see how many people have had fire issues.
[04:48:55] <JakeSays> i've used several hundred ws2812b's and have never had a bad one
[04:50:11] <GetShwifty> do i want to ask what you've done that requires you to use several hundred ...
[04:50:21] <JakeSays> i build shit
[04:50:47] <_genuser_> JakeSays dude you know there's always one guy who has to leave a bad review....
[04:50:48] <GetShwifty> now i'm imagining a skit like the Cowbell skit but instead of Cowbells.. it almost perfecti.. it just  needs more WS2812bs
[04:50:52] <JakeSays> well, by several hundred i mean ~200
[04:51:01] <JakeSays> _genuser_: of course
[04:51:16] <JakeSays> he's probably driving them with 60v or something
[04:51:23] <_genuser_> unless I see a few bad review, I just let it slide. On the fire, though, I might be a little cautious.
[04:51:52] <_genuser_> So I was thinking of rope lighting all around the room.
[04:52:01] <_genuser_> and then maybe you know sit down and watch "you've got mail".
[04:52:07] <JakeSays> LOL
[04:52:09] <_genuser_> I meant transformers...
[04:52:14] <JakeSays> i could totally see you doing that
[04:52:21] <_genuser_> and maybe Die Hard 1 & 2.
[04:52:36] <GetShwifty> and by die hard he means the sequel to You've got mail. You've got an SMS
[04:52:54] <_genuser_> well you know how much I like LED lighting in keyboards and on computer mobo's.
[04:52:57] <JakeSays> you've got a snap

[04:54:11] <_genuser_> why would I want to watch you've got sms or snap.

[04:54:22] <GetShwifty> Hah JakeSays.. nice
[04:54:37] <GetShwifty> i thought that was still in production
[04:54:40] <_genuser_> again, I think my keyboard is messing up. I meant to type, when I could "a world war II documentary"

[04:54:52] <GetShwifty> nice save _genuser_
[04:55:03] <_genuser_> lol.
[04:55:22] <_genuser_> all joking aside, I figured under the table or around the bottom of the room, might add nice accent lighting.
[04:55:32] <_genuser_> but I've never actually done it before. So who knows.

[10:06:34] <MatthiasVance> JakeSays: What I wonder, is it possible for OctoPrint to just load a file onto the SD and then instruct the printer "do your thing" and then reading out the progress?
[10:19:42] <JakeSays> MatthiasVance: octoprint will save to the sd card, but why would you want that?
[10:20:07] <MatthiasVance> I am wondering if it could instruct the machine to do things instead of sending the GCODE
[10:20:16] <MatthiasVance> I mean, save file to machine, tell machine to print
[10:20:20] <MatthiasVance> And then only read out progress
[10:20:35] <JakeSays> well, the way you instruct the printer to do things is via gcode
[10:20:41] <MatthiasVance> Yes, not what I mean heh
[10:21:01] <JakeSays> i think it is what you mean. you just don't know it. lol
[10:21:12] <JakeSays> the "api" of the printer is gcode
[10:21:24] <MatthiasVance> yes, would there be a GCODE for "print this file"?
[10:21:35] <JakeSays> i believe there is
[10:21:41] <JakeSays> but.. why?
[10:22:09] <MatthiasVance> Interesting
[10:22:28] <MatthiasVance> Why would OctoPrint need all the features then
[10:25:28] <JakeSays> MatthiasVance: huh?
[10:25:57] <MatthiasVance> What is the benefit of having all the features in OctoPrint when the printer can already report it's progress just fine?
[10:26:46] <JakeSays> report it where?
[10:27:10] <MatthiasVance> Having it available to fetch using another GCODE command
[10:27:33] <JakeSays> also i'm not sure what features you're talking about
[10:28:15] <JakeSays> also the way the printer reports progress is by responding "ok" after it processes a gcode command that was sent
[10:28:36] <MatthiasVance> Ah so you can't fetch progress during a print?
[10:29:02] <MatthiasVance> Also, I ran out of things to print :D
[10:29:03] <JakeSays> i'm not sure. might be possible.
[10:29:10] <JakeSays> but again, why?
[10:29:28] <JakeSays> as far as i'm concerned the sdcard is good for nothing beyond flashing
[10:29:28] <MatthiasVance> I just like to know the limits of what's possible, for .. educational purposes and .. fun! :D
[10:29:33] <MatthiasVance> Oh I agree
[10:29:35] <JakeSays> and even flashing can be done w/o it
[10:31:51] <JakeSays> MatthiasVance: install "marlingcodedocumentation" plugin

[10:35:11] <ki9a> they have 100 different models
[10:35:30] <ki9a> nice!
[10:38:04] <MatthiasVance> ki9a: Before you get started, you have to know a few things: Things will break, things will not work, things will be off, you will swear, you will have fun, you will tinker with stuff, you can upgrade almost anything.. or really.. anything.
[10:38:14] <MatthiasVance> It's a lot of waiting
[10:38:35] <MatthiasVance> Oh and I highly recommend buying a cheaper one first :D (like the Ender 3 V2)
[10:39:50] <MatthiasVance> JakeSays: So what is your top 3 of most useful stand alone prints? So not parts or replacements
[10:40:20] <MatthiasVance> I think my most useful prints were a self-designed battery cover (okay that's a replacement) and a box for batteries :P rest was toys
[10:40:34] <ki9a> yeah I'm not planning on getting one :)

[10:41:33] <MatthiasVance> ki9a: Also all the toys I make .. if a part breaks I can print it myself :P
[10:41:36] <ki9a> also got over a 100k of expenses pending in the upcoming year so it's out of budget for now
[10:41:49] <MatthiasVance> haha yes I know how that feels
[10:42:06] <MatthiasVance> Also that's what my wife said about something that would have netted me 1 million eur
[10:42:11] <MatthiasVance> booo
[10:42:24] <ki9a> haha
[10:42:35] <ki9a> but the odds of earning 1 million with a 3d printer are quite low :P
[10:42:37] <ki9a> that said
[10:42:45] <ki9a> I like the idea; just don't have a usecase yet

[11:23:02] <jmer> also I don't like that some former employee decided to "refactor" some code... and not put it in production before he leaves
[11:23:10] <jmer> then I base my changes of the latest master with his shit

[14:52:17] <biberu> Tazy: and for testing it's just substituted something that returns a deterministic result ofc
[14:52:34] <Tazy> well I made a mock http request message
[14:53:34] <biberu> having to mock a request message sounds odd
[14:53:59] <Tazy> sorry mock HttpMessageHandler
[14:54:32] <biberu> sorry, no advice for that, i rarely mock things
[14:55:24] <Tazy> well it was var httpClient = Substitute.For<HTtpClient>(); httpClient.SendAsync(Arg....).Returns(...);
[14:55:27] <biberu> if i have to mock i assume that something is wrong with the design
[14:55:41] <Tazy> and that was failing and blowing up with that invalid request uri
[14:56:39] <Tazy> Turning off "Enable just my code" Man the exceptions that are thrown are a lot
[14:57:48] <xb0o2> Tazy: you need an interface, no?
[14:58:20] <Tazy> What is worse, is in the other project using this httpclient, it just seems to die for some odd reason
[14:58:26] <Tazy> timeout
[14:58:33] <xb0o2> NSubstitute can only mock virtual methods on concrete classes
[14:58:34] <Tazy> but I can't catch the error or why
[14:58:54] <Tazy> xb0o2, yeah... you can sorta get classes mocked, but it's  iffy
[14:58:59] <Tazy> but mostly interfaces for that
[15:05:33] <irwiss> to be fair it says what's the issue in the exception... use full uris or set a base uri
[15:06:18] <Tazy> that was the test in that project, which I have fixed.
[15:10:02] <Tazy> I think because it's like 3 layers, and all the nuget packages, the project I am now in, would load the correct dll for layer 2, but not layer 1 behind that
[15:10:45] <Tazy> my project -> layer in the middle nuget package -> the http client nuget

[16:21:47] <hseg> So I had an idea for cleaning up some of my horrible dynamic dispatch: write Render() accepting a superclass of all the classes I want to support, dispatching to locally overloaded _Render() functions
[16:22:11] *** Joins: tsujp (~tsujp@sourcehut/user/tsujp)
[16:22:18] <hseg> Annoyance: Turns out local functions may not shadow names from their parents
[16:22:26] <xb0o2> Why do you prefer that option over an interface?
[16:22:53] <jmer> hseg: sounds like you need the Visitor Pattern
[16:23:30] <hseg> xb0o2: Probably am irrationally avoiding editing the classes themselves
[16:23:51] <hseg> But at least this is a less-horrible version of what I was doing
[16:25:11] <hseg> jmer: eh, not really? I just want a collection of classes to support Render(), as xb0o2 says the idiomatic way of doing that is modifying all of them to implement some IRenderable interface
[16:26:10] <hseg> anyway, my point was that I don't understand the motivation for this no-shadow rule -- it means refactoring into local functions forces renaming
[16:26:31] <xb0o2> Adding a base class expecting each subclass to implement a method is kind of the exact same deal as adding an interface... just with the added pain of inheritance.
[16:26:55] <hseg> base class is already there though
[16:28:08] <hseg> oh gdi is this another thing c#8 fixed which I'm missing out on?

[16:31:25] *** Joins: hseg (~hseg@195.192.229.23)
[16:31:37] <xb0o2> Well I don't know what the base class looks like to comment as to whether or not it seems appropriate but either way it means you're tying the calling code to that base class rather than remaining flexible enough to accept anything that implements the interface.
[16:34:11] <xb0o2> Just something to think about.
[16:34:27] <jmer> I solved a similar problem with the visitor pattern at least
[16:35:07] <jmer> had to represent a bunch of various shapes as XML and used the visitor pattern to call "Export" that fit each shape
[16:36:40] <hseg> fair enough
[16:37:25] <jmer> mine wasn't performance sensitive so I could even get away with casting to dynamic to cast to the specific IShape implementation, avoiding a if/else based on the object type
[16:39:20] <hseg> ... and it turns out this
[16:39:27] <hseg> solution doesn't work
[16:40:08] <hseg> if I keep it as local functions, c# complains - apparently overloaded local functions are illegal?
[16:40:31] <jmer> trying to fake multi dispatch in C# doesn't end well.. At least I never found a solution I was satisfied with
[16:40:57] <xb0o2> I'm not even sure why local functions would be relevant to what you're doing :/
[16:41:01] <jmer> you can overload local functions but their method signature can't be the same iirc
[16:41:36] <hseg> was trying to use C#'s single dispatch support to have it do the overload resolution
[16:42:53] <xb0o2> Without meaning to be too critical, I do feel like echoing the comments last night that you could have had a working interface-based solution written and tested by now :p
[16:42:59] <hseg> have another, much weaker objection to using the interface solution: it means spreading my render code around instead of having all render definitions (which share a lot of commonalities) in the same place
[16:43:13] <hseg> probably (:
[16:44:13] <canton7> hseg, if I understood what you're trying to do correctly.... 'void Render(Base b) { _Render(b); void _Render(Derived1 d) { ... } void _Render(Derived2 d) { ... } }' -- like that?
[16:44:25] <hseg> _sigh_ should probably stop fighting the language and do as it wants
[16:44:30] <hseg> canton7: yup
[16:45:04] <canton7> hseg, that's never going to work. The compile-time type of 'b' is 'Base', and method overload resolution is done at compile-time
[16:45:45] <canton7> All the compiler knows about 'b' is that it has type 'Base'. Since it has to pick an overload of '_Render' to call at compile-time, it *has* to pick one which accepts a 'Base': it can't bind to anything more derived
[16:45:50] <hseg> ah, fair
[16:46:11] <hseg> was thinking it was more dynamic than that, considering reflection exists
[16:46:34] <canton7> This is the compiler. It runs at compile-time. You can ask the runtime to get involved -- that's when things like reflection and 'dynamic' start working
[16:47:08] <canton7> So doing the same, but 'dynamic b' instead of 'Base b' *will* work, because that pushes the overload resolution out to runtime. But then you have to deal with the costs and lack of type-safety that 'dynamic' brings
[16:47:23] <hseg> makes sense
[16:48:34] <hseg> it's probably just the culture shock of getting back to c# after about a decade working in different languages with very different solutions

[20:54:52] <_Shurik_> to be completely honest, I have not yet discovered benefits of functional languages for non scholastic purposes
[20:54:59] <_Shurik_> could be my ignorance, I admit
[20:55:20] <jonp> _Shurik_: because those benefits have been added to C# & other languages over time
[20:55:31] <jonp> so what used to be an exclusive benefit is no longer exclusive
[20:56:04] <_Shurik_> I just don't see anything that C# lacks that allows to solve real life problems
[20:56:06] <khanred> I'm not some huge functional guy, it was just an example. But pure functions and map/reduce/filter can make code much more concise in some cases. The judicial application of functional concepts can lead to cleaner code, but the functionality purity stuff is taking it too far imo.
[20:56:17] <_Shurik_> that "prevents" to solve real life problems
[20:56:33] <jonp> _Shurik_: "prevent" is too broad of a brush
[20:56:37] <jonp> "simplify" is better
[20:56:46] <khanred> Most big languages are multi paradigm anyway
[20:56:47] <jonp> _Shurik_: consider the pre-LINQ vs. post-LINQ worlds
[20:56:57] <_Shurik_> functional languages is definitely on my research list, I admit
[20:56:59] <jonp> LINQ made many things *much* easier
[20:57:08] <jonp> and is almost entirely made up of functional concepts
[20:57:30] <khanred> Also React
[20:57:44] <_Shurik_> jonp: I still always revert to understanding of machine code to know that at the end that's how thing work
[20:57:58] <_Shurik_> syntax simplicity is all you get
[20:58:46] <_Shurik_> LINQ filters are grand definitely
[20:59:25] * ben <3 linq function syntax
[20:59:39] <ben> lets me pretend i'm using a functional language
[20:59:50] <khanred> lol
[21:00:12] <ben> map -> .Select(); reduce -> .Aggregate(); filter -> .Where();
[21:02:46] <khanred> Writing C# at my job would be an upgrade
[21:03:06] <khanred> I applied at my current job expecting to do it, but I ended up on a PHP team
[21:04:32] <ben> i do c# but it's a massive legacy winforms app
[21:04:42] <khanred> great
[21:04:45] <ben> so much logic in the designer code :(
[21:04:49] <jonp> ben: migrate to .NET 6 + WinForms?
[21:04:59] <jonp> then migrate to MAUI? :-D
[21:05:02] <Suchiman> ben: :s
[21:05:02] <ben> i'd like to but oof
[21:05:03] <jonp> (lol?)
[21:05:06] <ben> it's like 5+ million lines
[21:05:27] <Suchiman> ben: referencing any problematic tech that is unsupported on .NET?
[21:05:40] <khanred> I think maybe I'm just too opinionated. Like lack of unit tests makes me want to shoot myself and my coworkers..
[21:05:43] <ben> i'm sure, i haven't looked across all our solutions
[21:05:47] <_Shurik_> code readability is paramount
[21:06:07] <ben> we use a super-outdated infragistics controls release
[21:06:10] <ben> from liek 2009
[21:06:23] <ben> and https://www.oakleafsd.com/ mere mortals from 2005
[21:06:25] <Suchiman> ah... yeah... that will prolly do
[21:06:26] <khanred> Psh
[21:06:28] <_Shurik_> everyone should read "Clean Code" book for sure
[21:06:37] <khanred> _Shurik_, Good book
[21:06:42] <ben> we finally got to .net framework 4.8 recently
[21:06:44] <_Shurik_> really good book
[21:06:49] <khanred> I agree
[21:07:10] <khanred> But it also will make you hate most code you encounter in the wild
[21:07:38] <_Shurik_> khanred: well, that's my job to come in and fix bad practices
[21:07:45] <_Shurik_> so I thrive on bad code
[21:08:09] <Suchiman> ben: for the fun of it, you could try running https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/analyzers/portability-analyzer over the solution to see how much unsupported that is
[21:08:15] <khanred> I would gladly fix broken code if management would allow me
[21:08:32] <khanred> er, poorly written code*
[21:09:57] <_Shurik_> khanred: thus become consultant who is called in to fix bad code
[21:10:07] <khanred> Maybe
[21:10:14] <_Shurik_> when you're summoned for that task, you get authority
[21:10:17] <ben> heh ok i'm curious now
[21:10:25] <khanred> _Shurik_, I'll look into that
[21:10:44] <_Shurik_> ben: about?

[23:14:08] <ap5> Evening
[23:17:11] <MatthiasVance> Slade: IRCCloud is really nice :)
[23:17:36] <MatthiasVance> jonp: Do you have a corresponding 15 year old ticket for it?
[23:17:50] <MatthiasVance> or is it more of a recently discovered but ancient bug?
[23:17:51] <Slade> MatthiasVance, $50 per year isnt terrible
[23:18:06] <Slade> do you use the desktop client?
[23:19:10] <MatthiasVance> Yes, but I don't know why
[23:19:27] <Slade> highlights and icon separation
[23:19:49] <MatthiasVance> You have the same in browser
[23:20:01] <MatthiasVance> And also when I'm not looking I can get a mobile notification
[23:20:07] <Slade> the browser separates?
[23:20:09] <ap5> I use ZNC. Free. And hard to setup and maintain :D
[23:20:17] <MatthiasVance> Slade: Well you have desktop notifications in the browser and a favicon
[23:20:21] <MatthiasVance> So I would call that the same thing
[23:20:41] <MatthiasVance> ap5: I like ZNC .. however then you still need a client
[23:20:54] <Slade> ah, i like it being its own item on the taskbar, not buried with my 50 tabs/windows
[23:20:59] <MatthiasVance> Then yes go for it
[23:21:00] <MatthiasVance> Works nicely
[23:21:13] <Slade> and i dont like y'all enough to have mobile notifications
[23:21:22] <ap5> MatthiasVance, i use hexchat and CoreIRC on the mobile
[23:26:12] <MatthiasVance> ah!

[23:49:15] <canton7> I ended up using ZNC backing thelounge -- I pin the IRC tab (along with email etc), so it's always just sitting in the corner of the browser
[23:49:30] <canton7> tbh though the ZNC part is fairly pointless - it's a relic, but I keep it because it's good at writing logs
[23:52:38] <ap5> :)
[23:53:01] <ap5> I had that setup as well, but i didn't use thelounge, so i removed it
