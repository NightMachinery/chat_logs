[00:09:37] <rsjw> remember, fgets reads an entire line, not just the ATOM prefix you happen to be interested in

[00:12:59] <rsjw> also, the first format specifier in your fscanf format is %*d, which corresponds to an int. since fscanf is reading in a fresh line, after the one fgets already read in, and since the first field is not necessarily and int, fscanf will fail

[02:08:12] <megaTherion> well ok, C is an abstraction sooo
[02:08:35] <xb0o2> A reasonable abstraction to work with, though.
[02:08:45] <caze> xb0o2: No.
[02:08:51] <xb0o2> No?
[02:09:09] <caze> xb0o2: It more often than not gets in the way of understanding how C works.
[02:09:35] <xb0o2> Oh, thought you meant no as in C is not a reasonable abstraction to work with.
[02:09:58] <caze> C is as reasonable abstraction as any other.
[02:10:13] <caze> It depends on the problem you're solving, of course.
[02:10:29] <xb0o2> I'm just looking for a suggestion that's not along the lines of "this is a computer" but "this is the nitty gritty of C, welcome to the real world".
[02:12:15] <xb0o2> For the definition of nitty gritty being a very modern nitty gritty because I have no particular need to deal with older versions of C, specific compilers etc.
[02:13:05] <megaTherion> modern versions of C wont save you from that
[02:13:12] <megaTherion> (if modern verisons are available for your desired platform anyways)
[02:13:29] <caze> C is a language with a specification - learn the specification, not the implementations.
[02:13:49] <caze> And modern versions of C are for the most part, supersets of earlier versions of C.
[02:14:00] <xb0o2> So your recommendation in this situation is sit down with a C specification? Really?
[02:14:15] <caze> You can learn it from a book.
[02:14:28] <xb0o2> Which book?
[02:14:34] <xb0o2> Which brings us to the original question.
[02:14:50] <caze> But just be sure the book is teaching the language, and not a particular implementation.
[02:15:28] <oldlaptop> K&R2 remains well-regarded, especially for its exercises. The changes in newer revisions of C do very little more than add features it won't teach you.

[02:17:07] <oldlaptop> Some of them are, namely those that are widely-supported in practice. (Not all of the new features in C99 and C11 are widely-supported in practice, though C11 does make the ones they couldn't convince everyone to support "optional".)
[02:17:16] <caze> xb0o2: You can't really understand them without first understanding the existing features of the language.
[02:17:18] <axon> though I haven't read it, Effective C could be another choice, was released in 2020
[02:17:33] <oldlaptop> None of them are the kind of thing you see with C++, where many people will tell you that *failing* to use new features is *bad* practice.
[02:17:57] <caze> For instance, you can't understand variable length arrays without first understanding arrays.
[02:18:06] <oldlaptop> Failing to use //comments, or for (int var; ...), or interspersed declarations and code, is not something many people would call actively bad.
[02:18:49] <caze> xb0o2: There are really only two things in old C that are actively discouraged.
[02:18:50] <xb0o2> oldlaptop: So if I picked up K&R2, there's no glaring discrepancies between that and modern C?
[02:19:12] <oldlaptop> Not to nearly the same extent there would be with thirty years of development in most other languages.

[02:19:36] <xb0o2> Thank you.

[02:57:33] <fizzie> From N2432: "The -- property to provide declarations without prototypes -- has also been marked obsolescent in the C standard, but still is relatively widely used. In particular, it seems that the possibility to declare function pointers with unknown parameter lists is appreciated in parts of the C community for dealing with function call backs."

[02:58:27] <nomagno> Oh yes, that
[02:58:31] <nomagno> For callbacks
[02:58:55] <sham1> Could just cast back and forth between valid pointers to callback functions
[02:59:58] <nomagno> I agree with the reasoning of empty parameter lists being useful for callbacks, but
[03:00:03] <rsjw> from K&R1: "The identifiers in the parameter list, and only those identifiers, may be declared in the declaration list. Any identifiers whose type is not given are taken to be int."
[03:00:25] <fizzie> Could, though for some reason using an arbitrary "generic" function pointer type + explicit casts always feels a little like using a `char *` in place of a `void *`.
[03:00:45] *** Joins: cvmn (~caveman@gateway/tor-sasl/caveman)
[03:01:24] <rsjw> and K&R2 does talk about old-style definitions. it was pretty important to do so, so that people could supply function prototypes for their old-style functions and so they'd need to know how it worked
[03:02:00] <fizzie> As part of removing implicit int, they did change that last part for C99 and later; in addition to it being an "obsolescent feature", you do also have to declare all the identifiers.
[03:02:10] <sham1> I don't. I find it silly and even glib does this correctly by having a GCallback type which is IIRC either void(GCallback)(gpointer /* i.e. pointer to void */) or void (*GCallback)(gpointer)

[03:09:05] *** Quits: Klinda (~superleag@user/klinda) (Quit: Konversation terminated!)
[03:09:31] <sham1> It is indeed an interesting way of making use of the fact that a pointer to a function is compatible with another pointer to a function, and where one just needs to cast back to the original and everything is fine
[03:10:02] <fizzie> I was once thinking of using `typedef void any_function(struct any_function_dummy_parameter unused);` as a generic function pointer type, because the function would then be uncallable without converting it, since the struct declaration would have function prototype scope (and would be incomplete as well), meaning no value for the parameter could be constructed.
[03:10:13] <fizzie> Sadly, compiler warnings ruined that idea.
[03:10:45] <clarity> That's when I turn them off
[03:11:15] <fizzie> GCC has one warning about using the function prototype scope in general, and it also special-cases `void (*)(void)` as the only type exempt from the other warning about converting between incompatible function types.

[07:35:45] <pert> I asked this in #posix but think perhaps the larger audience here can help me out.
[07:35:47] <pert> how is the wc command supposed to work? POSIX says that it's required to work for binary files with arbitrary data, but then how do you recognize which characters are whitespace separating words if they can potentially be locale-dependent multibyte characters?
[07:36:00] <pert> should an implementation try converting sequences of bytes to a wide character opportunistically, and then, if that succeeds, pass it to something like iswspace? I'm pondering how to implement it myself if I were to write it in C

[07:40:47] <Rounin> You could also say that certain control characters etc. are separators along with whitespace... Then again, how would you know there isn't some encoding where they're used for text
[07:41:11] <Rounin> For instance, the Windows codepages sometimes use characters that ANSI encodings don't
[07:41:20] <crashrep> no, you can still do wc -w on binary files, and it returns a number

[07:52:20] <rsjw> maybe the current locale would tell you what format to consider it as
[07:53:49] <Rounin> Right, right... It's one thing to work with ASCII-based encodings, but then we have UTF-16 and UTF-32... Well, even in those encodings, I suppose a space would still be a space, except it would have extra nulls attached...
[07:54:05] <Rounin> Then you have issues such as the additional Unicode linebreaks and other kinds of spaces...
[07:54:27] <Rounin> Then you have languages with other kinds of separators due to having other writing systems... And then on top of that you have things such as EBCDIC
[07:54:41] <Rounin> It all depends on what you want the program to actually do
[07:54:57] <Rounin> For most things, even UTF-32, you should be able to just break on space, tab, form feed and the usual things, as they're < 128
[07:55:24] <Rounin> Unless you want to also support the additional Unicode whitespace characters
[07:55:33] <Rounin> wc -c would be a bigger problem, really
[07:55:55] <Rounin> Does it count bytes or codepoints or characters or what... What about UTF-16 surrogates, etc.

[16:11:45] <fizzie> pflanze: The relevant rule is C11 6.10.3.1p1; the "unless preceded by a `#` or `##` preprocessing token or followed by a `##` preprocessing token" bit exempts them in the direct case from the normal "is replaced by the corresponding argument after all macros contained therein have been expanded". That also explains why it works in the indirect case: in `#define xcat(a, b) xxcat(a, b)` the exemption does
[16:11:47] <fizzie> not apply, so "all macros contained therein" will be expanded when the `b` in `xxcat(a, b)` is being replaced by the argument corresponding to `b` (in the example, `Foo`).

[18:06:54] <nomagno> Is a libc function that always fails strictly compliant?
[18:09:03] <koollman> it could be. Depends on the function, I suppose
[18:09:20] <koollman> malloc comes to mind. NULL is a perfectly valid answer, always :)
[18:10:12] <Rounin> And of course, your machine could actually have 0 bits of RAM
[18:10:21] <Rounin> Only registers and cache and whatnot
[18:12:53] <fizzie> If it's a function that has a way of indicating failure (like malloc, or fopen, or whatnot), then I think always failing would be a quality-of-implementation issue, not a conformance issue.
[18:13:27] *** Joins: van (~van@46.23.94.214)
[18:14:13] <fizzie> From the C99 rationale, around environmental limits: "The C99 Committee reviewed several propsoed changes to strengthen or clarify the wording on conformance, especially with respect to translation limits. The belief was that it is simply not practical to provide a specification which is strong enough to be useful, but which still allows for real-world problems such as bugs. The Committee therefore
[18:14:15] <fizzie> chose to consider the matter a quality-of-implementation issue, and to leave the translation limits in the standard to give guidance."

[22:37:14] <ChoHag_> Comments are irrelevant but visually noisy, they can be ignored.
[22:37:21] <ChoHag_> Get rid of all the I/O for example.
[22:37:51] <ChoHag_> Or not if that makes the problem go away. Is the problem with reading, parsing or maths?
[22:37:53] <sokan> oh i see. So instead of the user giving aa_in1, I declare it and assign a variable to it
[22:38:11] <clarity> > (atom_id[l].type == "CA")
[22:38:18] <clarity> That's not how you compare strings

[22:40:10] <ChoHag_> sokan: It helps if you don't think of C as having strings. str[n]cmp compares base-256 numbers.
[22:40:52] <clarity> sokan: What are the inputs for which the program should print "l is 2"?
[22:41:21] <sokan> clarity: I fixed it. strcmp(atom_id[l].type, "CA") == 0 did the magic
[22:41:29] <ChoHag_> It's not magic.
[22:41:29] <sokan> ChoHag_: that's actually one excellent advice!!!

[22:46:09] <ChoHag_> Obviously C. I mean in this particular.
[22:46:42] <sokan> Figure out what my programming is doing wrong, mostly.
[22:46:52] <sokan> And when I see that, why it's doing it wrong.

[22:51:57] <sokan> ChoHag_: The purpose is indeed to parse that file, and then calculate distances based on specific numbers in that file
[22:52:05] <ChoHag_> What you could do is define a constant string of awk of perl source code and use C to execve it.
[22:52:28] <ChoHag_> That way you could write it in a sensible language in about 6 lines.
[22:52:47] <sokan> perl + bash + python +awk/sed would be much better, but they wanted C in order for us to learn "programming" logic
[22:52:50] <sokan> I guess
[22:52:56] <ChoHag_> That's bullshit.
[22:52:59] <sokan> haha
