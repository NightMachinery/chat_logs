[21:15:12] <Bayes> so in R it seems a package is the ultimate way to distribute things
[21:15:22] <Bayes> there are packages with utility functions, there are packages with data sets
[21:15:41] <Bayes> how would you go about packaging an *application* tho?
[21:16:10] <Bayes> something that you should run non-interactively somewhere else to produce results
[21:16:48] <fendur> "somewhere else"?
[21:16:57] <Bayes> yeah clusters for example
[21:17:08] <Bayes> or maybe locally
[21:17:09] *** Quits: Vojtaeus (~vojta@user/vojtaeus) (Quit: Odcházím...)
[21:17:19] <Bayes> but something that you would typically have as a script
[21:17:49] <fendur> how does an application differ from, say, lme4?
[21:17:57] <fendur> (not saying it doesn't)
[21:17:58] <Bayes> is that something like a package with an exported main function s.t. you call Rscript -e "PKG::doit()" ?
[21:18:18] <Bayes> fendur an application reads the data, fits many models, produces report files, etc
[21:18:33] <fendur> that would be a package, too
[21:18:46] <fendur> yes i think something like that should work
[21:19:30] <fendur> it may not HAVE to be a package. but that's the way of things and it would work the same as, say, a tgz of functions and scripts that work together with a call to Rscript
[21:19:49] <Bayes> hmm
[21:20:06] <fendur> CRAN is a nice way to distribute such collections of code like that because it's popular.
[21:20:12] <Bayes> is that the recommended way tho? like the best practice for encapsulating analyses?
[21:20:27] <fendur> i've never come across a package that is merely intended to just go()
[21:20:35] <fendur> so to speak
[21:22:03] <fendur> i do know of packages that play the role of organizing the data you give it, providing gui-ish tools to specify some model, then fit the model for you with a special technique for that particular model.
[21:22:11] <fendur> but it requires much more than go()
[21:22:28] <fendur> i don't know if that counts as an app.
[21:23:17] <Bayes> by app I mean...
[21:23:24] <Bayes> let's say you have a data analysis
[21:23:56] <Bayes> ie you get some raw data, clean, have many "sourceable" functions, which in a script you start calling to produce various outputs (figs, tables, reports, what have you)
[21:24:21] <Bayes> now, the whole progress of getting (say, downloading) and cleaning the raw data can be encapsulated in a package
[21:24:43] <Bayes> so that you install it once and then you have all other moving pieces to simply load the package to get the latest, curated data set
[21:25:32] <fendur> for me that would be my own code in a folder somewhere, called by Rscript.
[21:25:37] <Bayes> then you put all your "sourceable" functions in another package, say split_in_folds, fit_model_1, fit_model_2, compute_validation_statistics
[21:26:20] <Bayes> and then you have either a large script, of a family of smallish possibly sequential scripts along with say a bash file, to run the whole thing
[21:27:39] <Bayes> so this "actionable" script, ./run.sh or ./run.R or some, would load pkgdata to get the latest data set and pkgtools to get the latest code and run the analysis
[21:27:43] <Bayes> make sense?
[21:28:36] <fendur> yeah i think so
[21:28:48] <Bayes> well that's what I'm wondering
[21:28:57] <Bayes> like, say you want to handle your project to somebody else
[21:29:03] <Bayes> do you "send the script" :P?
[21:29:11] <Bayes> do you "send the package"
[21:29:18] <fendur> i send the organized folder and tell them how to use it
[21:29:29] <Bayes> do you... have your project as a git repo with a script that calls the corresponding packages?
[21:30:18] <fendur> yes git is good. but it'd still just be a folder of sourcable functions and scripts, for me.
[21:30:46] <fendur> but who TF am i? :)
[21:36:36] <Bayes> fair enough
[21:37:15] <fendur> that's what a lot of dashboards are, really, right?
[21:37:21] <fendur> apps
[21:37:58] <fendur> ours are organized folders in a git repo
[21:39:56] <Bayes> yeah I don't do dashboards personally
[21:40:02] <Bayes> don't think they're "responsive enough"
[21:40:10] <Bayes> I prefer documents and files
[21:40:25] <Bayes> and leave dashboard for the funny clients
[21:40:31] <fendur> responsive enough for what, though, right? we're pleasing customers with them
[21:40:41] <Bayes> yeah not for me :P
[21:41:09] <Bayes> I think many will argue that a "proper" approach to engineer the "run this script" approach is something like drake
[21:41:40] <Bayes> I can't say I'm a fan of the package, though I understand that it got way more friendly now that they're rewriting it as `targets`
[21:43:07] <Bayes> there used to be rmake or maker or something like that, which was an R package with a gnu make like flavor
[21:43:21] <Bayes> but it's been discontinued IIRC, no longer maintained
