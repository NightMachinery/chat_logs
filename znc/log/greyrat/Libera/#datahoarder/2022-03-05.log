[04:43:43] *** Joins: CharlesA (~CharlesA@ubuntu/member/charlesa)
[04:43:48] <cluelessperson> but I would prefer a front loading harddrive storage rack server case.
[04:44:08] <cluelessperson> the rosewill, it's impractical to remove a server from the rack to access hard drives quickly.
[04:48:52] * skye0 sighs
[04:49:05] <Allie> cluelessperson: is it not on rails? 
[04:49:28] <Allie> rosewill don't seem to understand the GDPR so i can't look at their website
[04:49:30] <skye0> busy restoring the OS backup i made. so annoyed because of graphics driver issues that caused my system to just irreversibly go to a black screen
[04:50:03] <skye0> tried learning the bullet points of the GDPR off by heart as part of work interviews but i don't want to think about work
[04:50:12] <cluelessperson> Allie, it is not, but I suppose it could be placed on rails.  It's just a half rack in my closet.
[04:50:27] <skye0> gonna lose sleep waiting for it but hey, at least i can play games or have midnight snakcs while i wait
[04:50:28] <Allie> cluelessperson: i mean the chassis - which chassis is it? 
[04:50:35] <cluelessperson> Allie, Really, I want a quiet storage server in my closet, and the storage server should have minimum processors.
[04:50:51] <cluelessperson> everything I'm finding online is just dual CPU or more, loud as hell
[04:51:26] <Allie> if i was building a small storage server today i'd probably pick a 1U box and hang DAS enclosures off it
[04:51:29] <cluelessperson> Allie, The one I have is a supermicro 12x 3.5 bay, dunno the exact model.  This one works because I replaced all the fans.   but I'm looking for a new one.
[04:52:00] <cluelessperson> Allie, that's probably a good idea.  a cute little 1U server with a raid card + DAS JBOD?
[04:52:07] <Allie> aye
[04:52:39] <Allie> QNAP make some nice JBOD boxes
[04:54:50] <Allie> the TL-R1200C-RP is cute - it's a rackmount USB-C JBOD. if you're putting spinning rust in it and you're not subjecting it to heavy workloads, that and a small 1U would be more than enough for a lot of people 
[04:54:56] <NeoThermic> Allie, from memory most of rosewil's stuff is also sold as Norco
[04:56:11] <NeoThermic> also I'd go down the route of 3U, but I'd build it myself; from memory 3U is the minimum height were you can just use standard ATX PSUs
[04:56:15] <unfinity> ・゜ ​ ゜・。。・゜゜\​_ö< QU​ACK!

[04:56:28] <Allie> ,bastards
[04:56:33] <NeoThermic> hopefully my shots land in russia..
[04:57:11] <NeoThermic> also relatedly unrelated, this is gonna be my new application server, to join my 4U NAS: https://www.servercase.co.uk/shop/server-cases/rackmount/1u-chassis/1u-server-case-w-4x-35-hot-swappable-sata-drive-bays-sc-1404/
[04:57:24] <cluelessperson> Allie, My current plan is like: 8-10x18TB drives in RaidZ2
[04:57:43] <cluelessperson> Yeah
[04:57:54] <cluelessperson> I'm also considering using like a rosewill case, which can hold like 12x3.5 drives
[04:57:59] <cluelessperson> and just throwing in a cheap mobo in that.
[04:58:20] <NeoThermic> 12 of them makes it 3U IIRC
[04:58:47] <Allie> 12 3.5* drives fit in a 2U high-capacity case
[04:59:02] <NeoThermic> ew :D
[04:59:22] <NeoThermic> also bonus tip
[04:59:33] <Allie> $work's warm storage is probably going to end up being those QNAP UASP JBODs tbh
[04:59:56] <NeoThermic> if you need 1U PSUs, nab a flex ATX adapter plate, and nab a flex ATX PSU, as they're often cheaper, but higher wattage and plat rated.
[05:00:37] <NeoThermic> flex ATX PSU is same height/length, but about 20mm thinner, hence the adapter plate
[05:01:51] <parted> what would you buy for <silent> fans
[05:02:13] <NeoThermic> noctua
[05:02:27] <parted> my free server that I got doesn't pass my partners' "its too loud" test
[05:02:59] <xMopx> i built a box with an sfx power supply a while ago, those things are so cute lol
[05:03:25] <NeoThermic> a good noctua will be more silent than standard server fans, but it will be less airflow too, so you gotta work out if the balance is ok
[05:04:20] <parted> hrm... okay. The problem are the cpu fans
[05:04:39] <NeoThermic> what U is it and what CPU?
[05:04:50] <parted> i wonder if i turned those off, and just had the standard 4cm fans across would be enough?
[05:04:54] <parted> 2U, E5606

[05:08:23] <NeoThermic> also yeah, that might be why I'm struggling to find a cooler
[05:08:30] <NeoThermic> it's been 11 years since that socket :D
[05:08:40] <parted> :\ yeah...
[05:09:07] <parted> at the end of the day, i could probably just buy a recent board, and replace it
[05:09:24] <NeoThermic> depends on the case, but possibly
[05:09:29] <parted> its a generic case
[05:09:59] <cluelessperson> NeoThermic, I think I want a 3U with the drives sidesways
[05:10:10] <Selavi> I'd use even a i5 2400 over that CPU tbh. those things put out serious heat for such little work
[05:10:21] <NeoThermic> parted, your electric bill will thank you
[05:10:44] <NeoThermic> 4c/4t for 80W is a terrible exchange

[05:11:48] <xMopx> i am running a 6/6 125W rn lmao
[05:12:07] <parted> NeoThermic: yeah... it did come with 3x those sata adapters
[05:12:14] <xMopx> amd 1090t
[05:12:17] <NeoThermic> *looks at 280W CPU in her desktop* hmm

[19:06:52] <ThePendulum> my god my mom is impressively bad at explaining games
[19:07:32] <ThePendulum> we were playing rummikub and my dad and I had never played it
[19:09:21] <ThePendulum> "so... the point is to put 30 on the table" - "they all need to be the same color?" - "the color does not matter" - "you can put any tiles that make 30?" - "no, of course not, they need to go together" - "what makes them to go together?" - "when they add up to 30"
[19:09:35] <ThePendulum> and in the end getting to 30 isn't even the point of the game, just the entry bet lmao

[19:30:07] <ThePendulum> rummikub: each player starts out with 14 tiles, each with a number 1-13 in one of 4 colors. you need to play either a sequence of the same number in different colors, or sequential numbers in the same color. for example, red 5, blue 5, black 5, or all black 5, 6, 7. you can extend or modify any sequence already on the table, even if it's not yours, but they always need to be at least 3 tiles 
[19:30:13] <ThePendulum> long. to first enter the game, a player must play a sequence adding up to 30. if they can't play, at any point in the game, they must take a tile from the spares pile
[19:33:27] <joepie91> ThePendulum: FYI that sounds like a neurotype mismatch :p
[19:33:50] <joepie91> I've noticed that ND folks often try to explain things procedurally whereas NT folks often try to explain them structurally

[19:34:24] <joepie91> logic rules in a game is typically one of those things that needs to be explained structurally...
[19:35:00] <ThePendulum> that could be, my mom also doesn't seem to understand that most software UIs are build in a similar way and she can use her understanding of one program to figure out another one
[19:35:08] <labrador> ThePendulum, sounds complicated
[19:35:30] <ThePendulum> I can't explain to her the concept of menus, input boxes, any generic UI element that she can look for in any program. she needs to be told exactly "ga met de muis naar de rechter bovenhoek"
[19:36:17] <joepie91> ThePendulum: that's probably a different issue tbh
[19:36:47] <joepie91> a thing I've noticed with computers is that people often *do* understand what to do, they just don't feel confident that their understanding is correct and don't want to "risk it"
[19:36:49] <unfinity> ・゜゜・。。・゜ ​ ゜\_​ö< QUACK​!
[19:36:51] <ThePendulum> ,bang
[19:36:51] <unfinity> ThePendulum you shot a duck in 2.515 seconds! You have killed 191 ducks in #datahoarder.
[19:36:52] <joepie91> ,bef
[19:36:52] <unfinity> You tried befriending a non-existent duck. That's freaking creepy.
[19:36:56] <joepie91> and much of the blame for that lies with devs tbh
[19:37:16] <labrador> ,bang
[19:37:16] <unfinity> There is no duck! What are you shooting at?
[19:37:18] <ThePendulum> I guess that plays a part of it as well
[19:37:20] <labrador> ,reload
[19:37:27] <labrador> ,help
[19:37:38] <joepie91> like, software should be built such that it is abundantly clear that 'trying stuff out' is a safe thing to do that won't do damage
[19:37:41] <joepie91> but almost no software actually is
[19:38:03] <joepie91> and so it just looks like a pile of complexity about which you can't confidently reason if it's not your specializtaion
[19:38:07] <joepie91> specialization*
[19:38:16] <joepie91> and every button looks like a potential delete button
[19:38:29] <joepie91> so people end up underestimating their understanding
[19:38:41] <labrador> joepie91, I have faced that fear multiple times. WHat eased that fear for me was cli programs that take in options using a config file. I can try out stuff without any fear now!
[19:38:49] <joepie91> ThePendulum: here's a neat hack: when she asks you how to do X, ask her her own question back but with different phrasing so that it sounds like you are asking her a *different* question
[19:38:57] <labrador> Whereas with guis there would be that "what if all of it got ruined cuz of me"

[19:39:04] <joepie91> 9 out of 10 times you'll find that the answer pops right out
[19:39:18] <ThePendulum> labrador: the rules of rummikub are pretty simple but it can be pretty challenging to get good at it
[19:39:23] <labrador> Like I get that with hexchat too...what if i misclick and press something I shouldn't have pressed and don't remember what I pressed
[19:39:40] <joepie91> this is how I dealt with this situation with my mom - doing that a couple of times and then telling her "yep, you got it right in one, that's the answer, see, you're pretty good at this"
[19:39:46] <ThePendulum> I think anyone can finish a game, but you can really get on another level if you can rainman the shit out of it
[19:39:51] <joepie91> and it really did help :p
[19:40:16] <joepie91> labrador: IME it's much less about how fragile stuff actually is and much more about how fragile it *appears*
[19:40:34] <ThePendulum> joepie91: I could give that a try
