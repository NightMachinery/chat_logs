[13:43:41] <p3rL> hello..
[13:43:55] <p3rL> can we dns in bridge instead IP 
[13:43:57] <xx> hope you're not running as root
[13:44:34] <p3rL> obfs4 DNS:PORT ...
[14:09:27] <p3rL> hello anyone ?
[14:09:30] <p3rL> i need help
[14:14:18] <xx> have you tried it?
[14:14:53] <p3rL> no
[14:14:58] <xx> then try it and see
[14:15:40] <p3rL> and 1 more thing ... how can i set the authentication if i set the SOCKSPORT 0.0.0.0:9050 < ... anyone can use my server with that port
[14:15:47] <p3rL> is here a way to set authentication
[14:17:13] <xx> you configure it in the torrc
[14:17:19] <p3rL> yes
[14:17:30] <xx> I meant that as an answer to your question
[14:18:03] <p3rL> but, it doesn't provide any user password authentication to secure connectivity ?
[14:18:22] <p3rL> just SOCKSPORT 0.0.0.0:9050 < who have my server ip can access the tor.
[14:18:45] <xx> search for 'auth' in manpage for torrc
[14:19:02] <p3rL> they are showing for socks5proxyuser & password
[14:19:27] <p3rL> to connect TOR over a socks5
[14:19:38] <p3rL> with authentication
[14:19:42] <p3rL> but no authentication for its own
[14:23:00] <p3rL> NOTE: Although this option allows you to specify an IP address other than localhost, you should do so only with extreme caution. The SOCKS protocol is unencrypted and (as we use it) unauthenticated, so exposing it in this way could leak your information to anybody watching your network, and allow anybody to use your computer as an open proxy.
[14:23:27] <p3rL> what a dumbshit they didn't code for SOCKSPORT authentication
[14:23:37] <xx> sounds like you found your answer
[14:24:15] <p3rL> its bad they have to add the authentication feature too
[14:24:27] <p3rL> wheres the fking devs are
[14:24:32] <xx> doesn't sound necessary
[14:25:21] *** Joins: |\n (~x0a@user/n/x-7623025)
[14:25:39] <xx> you'd have to come up with a realistic scenario where it is an issue for the supported usecases of tor
[14:26:45] <|\n> hi guys, could anyone pls provide some hint for the noob: can we run a bridge using other bridges at torrc? are there any mechanisms for internode relays communication inside tor families?
[14:26:54] <p3rL> ofcourse its usefull.. i am running tor on my vps, and that server have more thing running too someone can easily scan ports and get the tor SOCKSPORT and i can't even protect my tor
[14:27:01] <p3rL> because they dont have auth feature
[14:27:33] <xx> p3rL: that's not the control port
[14:27:37] <xx> there's no issue
[14:27:47] <|\n> asking because it seems weird a bit seeing "Servers must be able to freely connect to the rest of the Internet" in partially censored internet and not being able to invent a wrench using tor only capabilities
[14:28:18] <|\n> you could fwknop or something on that port eh?
[14:28:23] <p3rL> xx if i give you my ipv4 and you will try the 9050 you can easily use my tor sock
[14:28:30] <xx> p3rL: that's the point
[14:28:44] <xx> that's literally what tor does
[14:29:07] <|\n> you could also ssh to that 127.0.0.1 tor transport / socks
[14:29:38] <p3rL> no by default they are not allowing to bind 9050 with 127.0.0.1 ... if i bind myself SOCKSPORT 0.0.0.0:9050
[14:29:41] <xx> |\n: I don't know what "run a bridge using other bridges" means
[14:29:43] <p3rL> any one can use my tor socks 
[14:30:09] <p3rL> |\n you meant to say Bridge to Bridge ?
[14:30:28] <xx> p3rL: what's the issue with anyone using your tor socks?
[14:30:47] <|\n> xx, consider the following: i got a client with own set of bridges i wouldn't like to expose, i have another instance of tor i'd like to run at ISP subnets under heavy regime censorship - what are my options involving only tor as a solution?
[14:30:49] <p3rL> xx i installed tor for my own use not for others
[14:31:01] <|\n> i'd like to run it as either relay or a bridge
[14:31:31] <xx> |\n: a bridge that's not published to the directory then
[14:31:36] <|\n> p3rL, https://www.cipherdyne.org/fwknop/ https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh/tunneling/example and no tor allows to bind to localhost
[14:31:42] <|\n> xx, why?
[14:32:39] <xx> |\n: hmm, I think I see what you want. You want a bridge for personal use that nobody else will know about and nobody else but you can connect to?
[14:32:52] <xx> sounds like a job for ssh proxy
[14:34:20] <|\n> no, i want to provide a single public bridge into opressive ISP subnets, utilizing the set of private bridges at my possession yet not exposing any of them, using only tor as a solution to the end goal
[14:34:23] <|\n> is it possible?
[14:35:23] <|\n> (maybe not single, but anyhow, the perimeters so to say should be separate)
[14:37:27] <xx> a bridge *into* opressive ISPs?
[14:37:37] <xx> that's be an exit node, not a bridge
[14:37:58] <xx> also, not a very useful exit node for most purposes
[14:38:30] <|\n> no it wouldn't be an exit node
[14:38:35] <|\n> it would be a bridge as per torrc
[14:38:46] <|\n> looking at other private bridges of mine
[14:38:49] <xx> then I don't know what you mean
[14:39:10] <p3rL> |\n whats your aim :D
[14:39:31] <|\n> to allow at least a single public bridge to opressive ISP subnet p3rL 
[14:39:57] <xx> your use of "to" might be confusing here
[14:40:08] <|\n> potentially yes
[14:40:23] <xx> the tor client builds the entire circuit path and it cannot be interfered with
[14:40:36] <|\n> and i don't want to
[14:41:06] <|\n> i want my bridge to utilise private bridges
[14:41:18] <xx> do you want a mitm between your "public" bridge and a relay node, formed by your "private bridge"?
[14:41:36] <|\n> no, i want to provide an accessible public bridge at the censored ISPs subnets
[14:41:39] <xx> that stuff can't be done purely by tor, no
[14:41:52] <|\n> got it, what are my options?
[14:41:55] <xx> well how is what you're describing different from a regular bridge?
[14:41:59] <xx> that's what I'm asking
[14:43:13] <|\n> i got an access to several subnets including non-censored ones, the non-censored ones allow me for external resources across the globe to host something, what are my options to populate the public bridge technically at the e.g. given consored ISP subnet?
[14:43:36] <xx> a bridge is just an entry node that's not published into the public directory. A public bridge can be obtained through the various tor means, such as sending an email to a specific address. A private bridge is not published anywhere and can only be used if you know its address.
[14:44:03] <|\n> i know how to obtain public bridges, but these are censored as of now in that end goal ISP subnet
[14:44:07] <xx> well, I'm confused by what you're trying to do, and possibly by your understanding of what a bridge is
[14:44:19] <|\n> i am confused as well
[14:44:34] <xx> describe what a user wants to achieve
[14:44:53] <xx> say they are at home, with a tor browser open at their computer. What now?
[14:45:17] <|\n> the user wants to be able to receive a non-censored bridge with an address at the subnet of his own ISP that complies to censorship regulations
[14:45:33] <xx> that's out of scope for tor
[14:45:38] <|\n> why?
[14:45:47] <xx> because filtering nodes are removed from the network
[14:46:02] <|\n> filtering?
[14:46:05] <xx> yes
[14:46:12] <|\n> what do you mean by filtering nodes?
[14:46:22] <xx> if an exit node performs censorship, it is removed from the directory
[14:46:39] <|\n> what exit node?
[14:46:42] <xx> similarly if an entry node prevents access from some specific IP
[14:46:51] <xx> and same for relays
[14:47:22] <xx> you don't get to pick what bridge you receive if you ask for it using that email address, or the other public means
[14:47:30] <xx> you can however setup your own bridge anywhere you want and use it
[14:48:03] <|\n> wait, it is not the opresses ISP users who prevent the internet access for themselves, it is an ISP and if someone at this ISP subnet has routes for uncensored www subnets there are not technical means for utilize this leverage?
[14:48:25] <xx> I think you're confusing networking terminology
[14:48:32] <|\n> maybe
[14:49:06] <xx> the only part of the tor network that sees where the user wants to go is are the exit nodes
[14:49:20] <xx> bridges, entry nodes, relay nodes don't know where the user wants to go, it's encrypted
[14:49:24] <|\n> i don't care where they go, i care about entry point
[14:49:35] <xx> but you're talking about bridges, bridges are entry points
[14:49:42] <|\n> yes
[14:50:01] <xx> so how would you do any sort of censorship at the bridge?
[14:50:26] <xx> the best you could do is setup a firewall that prevents access to the bridge from some IP ranges
[14:50:32] <xx> but nothing more fine-grained than that
[14:50:38] <|\n> exactly how it now works in russia man
[14:50:51] <xx> everything is fine in russia if you use private bridges
[14:50:56] <xx> no slowdown either
[14:50:59] <|\n> and i actually don't care how they lock up with obfs public nodes
[14:51:09] <|\n> i do, but what about others?
[14:51:30] <xx> well give them a bridge that's not published anywhere, and ask them to not share the bridge address with anyone
[14:51:43] <|\n> why would i fall into trust issue model?
[14:51:55] <xx> because that's how a private bridge works
[14:52:01] <xx> only those who know about it can use it
[14:52:14] <|\n> i can provide a bridge at their ISP subnet exactly securely, being public (not for eternity maybe, but still)
[14:52:39] <xx> well, I'm stepping out because we're going in circles where I still don't know what you mean
[14:52:50] <xx> read the tor docs, maybe you'll find what you're looking for
[14:53:17] <|\n> i wouldn't join if i wouldn't try to read first though might be missing something indeed
