[23:07:39] <technomancy> as long as gemini people are honest about it being a totally recreational thing I have no problem with it
[23:07:54] <lep> "the fact that trolls are upsetting so many people convinces me that they are meeting their goals"
[23:07:57] <cb> i cant fault recreation
[23:08:05] <technomancy> the real nutters are the ones saying it's actually more useful than HTML 2.0
[23:08:07] <cb> i.e i think plan 9 is a mistake, but i can respect what the 9front people do
[23:08:10] <manicennui> technomancy: Why would it matter whether it is "recreational"?
[23:08:13] <cb> and yes those are the people i beef most with
[23:08:23] <cb> manicennui: because then its uselessness doesn't mater
[23:08:29] <technomancy> manicennui: it's just about being honest about your motivations
[23:08:31] <cb> it's masturbation but honest about it
[23:08:37] <manicennui> How does its usefulness matter in either case?
[23:08:41] <manicennui> If you don't like it, don't use it.
[23:08:53] <cb> if it was proposed as a /useful/ thing, then its uselessness would become a problem
[23:09:01] <manicennui> Why?
[23:09:19] <technomancy> are you asking why dishonesty is bad?
[23:09:20] <cb> because its lack of functionality would make it unfit for purpose
[23:09:31] <manicennui> I don't think they are being dishonest.
[23:09:31] <cb> but if that's not the intended purpose it doesn't matter
[23:09:44] <manicennui> I think people are mad because it doesn't fit *their* usecase.
[23:09:46] <manicennui> use case
[23:10:11] <cb> i dont think it fits any use case. it's less functionality than http/1.0 and html 1.0
[23:10:25] <technomancy> the original gemini guy came out and said that the point of gemini is to be exclusive
[23:10:25] <cb> but if it's for nerds to masturbate wiht and they're honest, who cares
[23:10:29] <manicennui> Like many things, it seems like people being mad about something they wouldn't use regardless.
[23:10:42] <technomancy> and that technically speaking there's no point in adopting it over older versions of HTML
[23:10:47] <cb> i wouldnt but i get mad when people think it's a legitimate alternative to the www
[23:10:50] <cb> i.e devault was proposing that
[23:11:01] <manicennui> Why would you get mad?
[23:11:14] <manicennui> Seems kind of silly.
[23:11:25] <cb> because he could influence others into thinking as such
[23:11:36] <manicennui> Oh no!
[23:11:56] <manicennui> Of all the possible "bad influences", I'm not sure that one is worth worrying about.
[23:12:27] <technomancy> "we don't have a way to publish documents on the web without the bad influence of Javascript" is just stupid
[23:12:33] <manicennui> I'd be much more concerned about all of the bad influences on the web.
[23:12:44] <edk> you can just publish documents on the web without using javascript
[23:12:52] <edk> no?
[23:12:56] <cb> edk: i agree but the larpers gonna larp
[23:13:12] <dcand> Hi, I would like to get an account on  lobste.rs
[23:13:12] <cb> let them wear the hairshirts
[23:13:13] <manicennui> I just find the level of anger amusing.
[23:13:29] <technomancy> if you're gonna go in on gemini at least be honest that you're treating it like a nand2tetris thing
[23:13:33] <edk> angmusement should be a word
[23:14:13] <technomancy> if you claim you're choosing it for technical merits that's going straight into the killfile
[23:14:33] <edk> what annoys me about gemini is that there really are serious problems with the web, and everyone using gemini is using gemini instead of fixing them
[23:14:50] <cb> it's escapism
[23:14:52] <manicennui> edk: So you are mad that they aren't using their time the way you would like them to use their time?
[23:14:58] <edk> no, i'm not mad at all
[23:15:12] <manicennui> s/mad/annoyed/
[23:15:36] <kline> edk, im not convinced theres any incentive _to_ fix html/js/css though
[23:15:38] <edk> i mean, i don't spend time thinking about gemini when i'm not reading #lobsters talking about it
[23:16:03] <technomancy> kline: performance =)
[23:16:06] <edk> so in one sense i'm currently annoyed because you're asking me a stupid question
[23:16:07] <riv> i was very interested in gemini early on but I went in a direction i dont like
[23:16:16] <technomancy> I mean, the trick is to get startups to care about performance
[23:16:20] <technomancy> which is really difficult
[23:16:30] <edk> but no, i think it's annoying because i perceive it to be a form of hypocrisy
[23:16:46] <riv> I think we have a lot of potential to make a better minimalist linked document platform
[23:17:22] <riv> I would like one that has primitives for annotation for example
[23:17:39] <riv> (think fermats library or soundcloud commenting on audio)
[23:17:44] <riv> or genius.com
[23:18:03] <technomancy> riv: best to just treat it like collapseOS. people have fun reinventing the wheel because ... it actually can be fun.
[23:18:52] <technomancy> it's like people doing an alternate history cosplay; similar to steampunk enthusiasts
[23:19:13] <edk> it's "X has problems, we must fix them!" followed by taking such an extreme position that you're never going to be successful anyway, and so you don't have to solve any real problems at all
[23:19:24] <edk> and yes, it's fine making things that don't solve any problems
[23:20:08] <technomancy> edk: just be honest about your motivation and recreational intent; is that so hard?
[23:20:11] <riv> dont pm people randomly please
[23:20:12] <edk> yeah
[23:20:19] <manicennui> I don't think they are being dishonest.
[23:20:24] <manicennui> I think you disagree with their assessment.
[23:20:43] <riv> > never going to be successful anyway
[23:20:51] <riv> this stops a lot of my ideas happening ;;
[23:20:58] <manicennui> riv: Why?
[23:20:59] <dcand> riv: ok
[23:21:07] <riv> i know my idea is "good" but... worse is better.
[23:22:07] <dcand> Can I get a invite
[23:22:46] <edk> riv: i may have failed to provide a lucid characterisation, but what i'm trying to describe here are things that are *designed* not to be successful
[23:23:19] <riv> ohh?
[23:23:48] <riv> i remember haskell used to have an in-joke "avoid success at all costs"
[23:25:20] <edk> i don't believe gemini's proponents have any expectation or intention to replace the web, for example. iirc they're quite open about that
[23:25:52] <riv> but that's just realism isn't it?
[23:25:55] <ngoldbaum> dcand: see the link in the topic, asking over and over again reduces the likelihood that someone will send you one
[23:26:05] <dcand> Why this discussion about gemini matter
[23:26:11] <edk> it's interesting to us
[23:26:18] <edk> so we're talking about it. that's how conversations work
[23:26:23] <riv> lol
[23:27:32] <edk> riv: i mean that is realistic, but it's also not really doing anything to address any real problem. they're just creating something they find pleasing, for fun. good for them!
