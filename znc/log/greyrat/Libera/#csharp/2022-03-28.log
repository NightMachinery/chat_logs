[02:39:30] <Ameisen> I decided to do a non-scientific benchmark against new[], GC.AllocateUninitializedArray, and GC.AllocateArray.
[02:39:34] <Ameisen> https://pastebin.com/pDFxQji7
[02:39:45] <Ameisen> I was kinda expecting AllocateUninitializedArray to be more performance at some point.

[02:48:38] <Suchiman> Ameisen: well, it's complicated xD
[02:49:08] <Suchiman> Ameisen: first of, for reference types and small arrays, this does not apply, https://source.dot.net/#System.Private.CoreLib/src/System/GC.cs,652
[02:52:06] <Nasp> This tracing library really sucks
[02:52:20] <Nasp> If there's no existing parent trace, then it just doesn't even start one

[02:56:28] *** Quits: Klinda (~superleag@user/klinda) (Quit: Konversation terminated!)
[02:57:39] <Suchiman> Ameisen: second, for GC heap allocations there's a so called "allocation context" (per thread), it's a region of pre-zeroed memory in which pointer bump allocation via handwritten asm is performed. If the current allocation request exceeds the allocation context available space, the slow path is triggered, which will, depending on a complex state machine of choices, for example, search for a contiguous region of free memory on the heap >= the
[02:57:39] <Suchiman> allocation request and zero that memory to be used as the new allocation context. So the zeroing overhead is not incurred when calling `new T[]`, unless that allocation request is big enough to exceed the allocation context. If you call, AllocateUninitializedArray, it will first attempt to satisfy the allocation request from the allocation context (which is already pre zeroed so you'd receive zeroed memory even if you specified that it's okay
[02:57:39] <Suchiman> not to), otherwise if you've asked for more than the allocation context, then you'll actually receive (at least partially) uninitialized memory

[03:02:37] <Nasp> Suchiman:  When you log to seq, what do you use as servicename?
[03:13:25] <Suchiman> Nasp: ?
[03:13:44] <Nasp> When you log to Seq, don't you use a name to identitfy what service wrote that log?
[03:13:48] <Nasp> Or was it splunk you used?
[03:14:40] <Suchiman> Nasp: yeah, each service gets their own api key, on the api key there are 2 properties defined, App and System, System is like Staging or Prod, App is the name of the app
[03:15:15] <Nasp> Just system?
[03:15:19] <Nasp> Or did you only have one service
[03:15:27] <Suchiman> Nasp: App and System
[03:15:30] <Suchiman> counting helps :P
[03:15:36] <Suchiman> and reading
[03:16:10] <Nasp> Hmm ok so they are defined by the api key
[03:16:34] <Nasp> We ususally use the process name
[03:16:38] <Nasp> But we also have a bit more
[03:16:39] <Suchiman> yeah and the api keys are automatically generated and assigned by the release pipeline before running the ARM template that sets that api key into the app settings
[03:18:19] <Suchiman> Nasp: so the name for the app is manually chosen as part of the release pipeline creation
[03:18:45] <Nasp> Ahh
[03:18:51] <Suchiman> and the system name is automatically derived from the release stage name
[03:19:02] <Nasp> Ours is basically just the namespace
[03:19:33] <Suchiman> Nasp: ah, yeah, our names are simple, like Account for the SSO service or Pdf for the pdf document generation service or Ocr for the Ocr service :P xD
[03:20:19] * Suchiman had pdf.azurewebsites.de back in azure germany
[03:23:40] <Suchiman> Nasp: did i mention that my release pipeline is amazingly automated :P ? you go to a release definition, create a stage and give it a stage name like ImportantTest, then it will generate an seq api key for App = Account; System = ImportantTest, feed that with a few other settings into the ARM template which then creates all app services, databases, storage accounts, dns, and putting the RUN_FROM_PACKAGE setting with the release url in
[03:23:56] <Suchiman> and then creating the user accounts in the database for the app to use :P
[03:24:57] <Nasp> I just push a branch
[03:24:58] <Nasp> Done
[03:25:06] <Nasp> :D
[03:25:22] <Nasp> Is it RUN FROM PACKAGe thaths the ziup thingy
[03:25:27] <Suchiman> yes
[03:25:27] <Nasp> Which avoids the Azure bug
[03:25:33] <Suchiman> which bug?
[03:26:08] <Suchiman> Nasp: well... yeah, i could do that :P xD create a stage that deploys any branch, using the branch name as the system name
[03:28:01] <Nasp> There was a bug in web app that crashed all application pools if you did or didnt use that run from package
[03:28:12] <Nasp> Accoding to azure it was a feature
[03:28:25] <Suchiman> lol
[03:29:06] <Suchiman> i use this feature mainly because it's very convenient, it means i can do the entire deployment in a single ARM template, one ARM template that does infrastructure deployment, code deployment and slot swapping in one go
[03:31:32] <Nasp> It was a bug they fixed once and then introduced
[03:31:40] <Nasp> If you send 250 chars or osmething in the url
[03:31:48] <Nasp> Then it would jsuyt recycle ALL servers in your app service
[03:31:56] <Nasp> And it was related to RUN From PACKAGe
[03:32:03] <Suchiman> Nasp: ah yeah i remember you complaining about that and warning me about that but i couldn't repro it
[03:32:11] <Nasp> yeah

[04:36:42] <Ameisen> Suchiman: so, at a base level, if the array is for reference types, or it is likely to be 'small', I should just use new[]?
[04:37:14] <Suchiman> Ameisen: yeah, as you can see in the source code, if the array size is less than 2kb, it will do that for you automatically
[04:37:18] <Ameisen> For a large array, primitive array, I'm unsure if there's any downside to using AllocateUninitializedArray. It doesn't seem any _slower_. There's a function call involved, but that seems to be basically negligible.
[04:37:45] <Suchiman> Ameisen: yeah large primitives arrays is where AllocateUninitializedArray can show improvements
[04:38:03] <Ameisen> if the size is unknown, might make sense to also call it, since it will revert to new[] anyways.
[04:38:33] <Ameisen> for my use case, about half of my arrays are < 2KiB, and the other half are larger (usually around 12KiB or larger), and that's pretty predictable.
[04:38:40] <Ameisen> inputs are tiny, outputs are big
[04:38:52] <Ameisen> They're also usually containing structs, so value types
[04:39:19] <Suchiman> Ameisen: that works, as long as the structs do not contain any reference types
[04:39:25] <Suchiman> like strings or such
[04:39:33] <Ameisen> They're wrappers around `uint` and `ulong` (color8 and color16)
[04:39:41] <Suchiman> that should work
[04:40:35] <Suchiman> llanhmod: looks about right
[04:42:22] <llanhmod> Suchiman: okay, why the exception? docs say likely developer error but I'm not sure what else I need to do.

[04:44:18] <llanhmod> Suchiman: I believe so, `dotnet list package` says 2.15.0 for both.
[04:46:01] <llanhmod> I would like to know wher this 'List of configured name servers' is located

[13:31:22] <alguien> JakeSays, so what's the right direction, my man?
[13:32:02] <JakeSays> alguien: a ui framework that draws its own controls instead of relying on native platform gui frameworks (like xamarain)
[13:32:51] <alguien> oof
[13:33:44] <alguien> Idk, maybe you turn out to be right
[13:33:50] <alguien> But that was Xamarin's main selling point
[13:33:54] <JakeSays> i know
[13:34:02] <alguien> Now it's competing with Flutter
[13:34:18] <JakeSays> but just because a framework renders its own controls doesn't mean they dont look/act native
[13:34:19] <alguien> I mean, assuming this takes off. "There is no official support. Use at your own Risk."
[13:34:27] <alguien> JakeSays, ayayay
[13:34:30] <JakeSays> take for instance wpf - it renders 100% of everything
[13:35:06] <alguien> I'm only familiar with UWP
[13:35:22] <JakeSays> i'm pretty sure uwp does as well
[13:35:27] <blez> the only thing that uses custom render and looks native is Qt
[13:35:37] <JakeSays> blez: and flutter
[13:35:44] <blez> flutter on OSX?
[13:35:55] <JakeSays> flutter on ios/android
[13:36:11] <JakeSays> flutter on osux probably looks like ios
[13:36:20] <blez> so, only qt then :)
[13:36:30] <JakeSays> no, not only qt
[13:36:39] <JakeSays> you didn't specify every platform :p
[13:40:25] <blez> I'd rather use C# instead of Dart

[22:20:49] <DevJohnC> it's exactly what it sounds like
[22:20:49] <redoc> must be some sort of cache?
[22:20:59] <Suchiman> DevJohnC: WinUI3 runs on standard coreclr
[22:21:08] <DevJohnC> nvidia have a RAID driver thing that uses a nvidia GPU to run RAID parity calculations and shiz
[22:21:22] <redoc> DevJohnC: i never knew that...
[22:21:27] <DevJohnC> Suchiman, neat
[22:21:31] <bomb> cute. Nvidia does everything to penetrate into server market

[23:18:24] <Guest87> takes one to know one
[23:18:35] <JakeSays> MichaelLong: what does scrubbing do?
[23:19:48] <MichaelLong> AFAIK it checks the checksum information in some kind of deferred way. e.g. you can start this process in idle time situations or over night. not sure if it can actually correct something or whether it is just to detect bitrot
[23:20:18] <JakeSays> zfs has something similar. it's called re-silvering.
[23:20:21] <irwiss> zfs scrubbing corrects the data
[23:20:48] <MichaelLong> I know my NAS is doing it occasionally
[23:21:05] <JakeSays> the idea is to read the data and write it to refresh the magneticy things
[23:21:12] <MichaelLong> proabably I left one of the volumes on btrfs by accident
[23:21:34] <MichaelLong> you mean to create unnecessary wear?
[23:21:47] <JakeSays> no. to prevent bit rot
[23:22:27] <irwiss> wear isn't really irrelevant on modern ssds, unless it's some weird super write-heavy scenario on almost filled drive
[23:22:44] <JakeSays> it's only useful on magnetic media
[23:22:46] <MichaelLong> I don't even know if bit rot is an actual thing. there're not very many reports in typical tech media about such kind of issue
[23:22:58] <JakeSays> it's definitely a thing on magnetic

[23:29:03] <Guest87> What is it? Ibuprofen?
[23:29:44] <JakeSays> lol yeah thats it
[23:29:55] <Guest87> Well I hope you get it and feel better soon
[23:30:15] <JakeSays> it's a samsung s7 fe
[23:30:27] <MatthiasVance> Tough to swallow
[23:30:34] <bomb> lol
[23:31:27] <JakeSays> MatthiasVance: lol
[23:31:50] <JakeSays> the one i have now is too damn slow
[23:32:25] <brianonymous> the FE part stands for Fart Emitter
[23:32:40] <brianonymous> but in reality - i didnt know they made an s7 tablet
[23:32:53] <JakeSays> they make an s8 now
[23:33:02] <JakeSays> s7 is last year's model i think
[23:33:13] <Guest87> Probably slow and pants now
[23:33:14] <brianonymous> im out of touch with the latest tablet tech
[23:33:24] <JakeSays> Guest87: pants?
[23:33:48] <brianonymous> my daughter requested a new ipad for xmas to draw with.. i got her it and then kicked her out of the house
[23:33:53] <MatthiasVance> JakeSays: How much did you pay for it?
[23:34:07] <JakeSays> MatthiasVance: ~$600
[23:34:17] <JakeSays> brianonymous: lol why'd you kick her out?
[23:34:20] <brianonymous> cuz ipad
[23:34:37] <JakeSays> i thought you were an apple fanboi
[23:34:46] <brianonymous> she is an android girl tho, she only uses the ipad cuz it had better drawing software on it
[23:34:55] <brianonymous> me? are you cray?
[23:35:03] <redoc> yea, ipad is pretty good for artists
[23:35:04] <JakeSays> yeah. don't you have an iphone?
[23:35:33] <brianonymous> i have this tiny wee iphone for work that i only use to test player apps with.. but id rather it not be in my life. i have an s20+
[23:35:50] <redoc> Galaxy fold 3 FTW
[23:35:51] <brianonymous> basically, if i have an apple product here in my office, you can assume 'work issued'
[23:35:55] <JakeSays> ah ok. well good. i was worried there fo ra minute
[23:36:25] <brianonymous> i have this macbook pro for the vpn, but i feel like a total idiot (more so than usual) using it
[23:36:30] <redoc> JakeSays: you use iPhone?
[23:36:31] <brianonymous> like im typing with elbow knubs
[23:36:39] <JakeSays> i'm not gonna return to samsung for phones until i can install my own os
[23:36:49] <JakeSays> redoc: hell no. pixel 6 pro
[23:37:02] <redoc> why can't you install your own OS on samsung phones?
[23:37:15] <JakeSays> because they don't want you to
[23:37:30] <redoc> im certain you can, you will just trip knox
[23:37:50] <bomb> Samsung tablets with stylo are great for drawing
[23:38:00] <JakeSays> i thought they made it next to impossible on newer models
[23:38:23] <redoc> JakeSays: idk about that, i havent ran custom roms in years
[23:38:35] <brianonymous> ive never tried, cuz i enjoy a working phone, lol
[23:38:45] <redoc> i just know they made it impossible without tripping knox, which removes some features
[23:38:56] <brianonymous> i did root a few of the early droids, like my motorolas
[23:38:57] <JakeSays> i went with the pixel because they're easy to flash
[23:39:26] <redoc> i went with the fold because tablet in pocket is awesome
[23:39:31] <JakeSays> i have a note 1 running JakeDroid
[23:39:44] <redoc> note 1...
[23:39:50] <blez> redoc what's knox?
[23:39:53] <JakeSays> yeah. it's 10years old
[23:40:02] <JakeSays> blez: samsung's security shit

[23:41:06] <redoc> no one is worse than t-mobile reading your texts and deciding to send it through or not if it finds 'misinformation'
[23:41:18] <JakeSays> brianonymous: cool!
[23:41:27] <brianonymous> JakeSays: ive dedicated a full spare desk to it
[23:41:28] <JakeSays> redoc: wtf.. what?
[23:41:45] <JakeSays> brianonymous: what ya gonna build?
[23:42:05] <blez> I got my dad A52s 5G. Great phone for 300 eur. I was impressed
[23:42:07] <brianonymous> JakeSays: first project attempt, i bought some 8086 cpus
[23:42:09] <redoc> JakeSays: tmobile was screening texts for covid 'misinformation'
[23:42:19] <JakeSays> brianonymous: LOL really?
[23:42:24] *** Tobbi__ is now known as Tobbi
[23:42:28] <JakeSays> redoc: that's seriously fucked up
[23:42:40] <brianonymous> JakeSays: yeah.. i also want to buy some 6502/6510, but goddamn, they arent cheap these days

[23:43:15] <JakeSays> that's just wrong. texts are private communication
[23:43:19] <redoc> talk about invading privacy
[23:43:29] <redoc> boycot tmobile
[23:43:44] <JakeSays> next they'll be interrupting phone calls with "the caller just give you fake news"
[23:43:56] <redoc> I wonder if they can intercept iMessage's ?
[23:44:09] <brianonymous> at this point, Orwell is a prophet
[23:44:11] <JakeSays> brianonymous: what are ya gonna build with the 8086's?
[23:44:36] <brianonymous> JakeSays: i just want to see if i can make a functional computer with it
[23:44:48] <bomb> blez "cheap chinese" products are getting better and better. I noticed that with electirc guitars

[23:46:25] <JakeSays> yeah iirc memory access is a lot more complicated
[23:46:48] <JakeSays> i'd love to get my hands on an 8008
[23:46:54] <JakeSays> or 4004
[23:46:59] <brianonymous> JakeSays: it seems to have a lot of what i interpret as "bus modes" and overly complex internal state/pin mapping
[23:47:09] <JakeSays> right
[23:47:10] *** Joins: Haxxa (~Haxxa@202-130-210-100.ip4.superloop.com)
[23:47:18] <brianonymous> in fact, they recommend using their clock ICs
[23:47:37] <brianonymous> and that makes me sad/scared. i just wanted a dumb cpu to make puter with
[23:47:48] <JakeSays> z80
[23:47:57] <JakeSays> those should still be available
[23:48:07] <brianonymous> they are.. but if i switched, id wanna go 6502
[23:48:21] <brianonymous> just cuz i know that system quite well
[23:48:33] <JakeSays> right
[23:48:42] <JakeSays> you could fpga one up
[23:49:08] <brianonymous> https://www.electro-tech-online.com/datasheets/8086_intel.pdf
[23:49:19] <brianonymous> fpga is cheating a smidge

[23:49:53] <brianonymous> yeah, saw those last night, but they come from china and i want stuff this weekend
[23:49:59] * brianonymous is impatient
[23:50:03] <JakeSays> LOL
[23:50:04] <MatthiasVance> Buy a ticket to China, fixed

[23:55:27] <JakeSays> LOL this would be fun https://monster6502.com/
[23:55:58] <brianonymous> it has the internal clock tho, and that makes me a wee bit sad
[23:55:59] <JakeSays> i always wanted to do that with an 8080
[23:56:11] <JakeSays> brianonymous: why sad?
[23:56:57] <brianonymous> well, lets say i wanted to do something really weird, like see if i can build my own breadboarded c64.. id need full control of the clocks
[23:57:34] <brianonymous> oh, it looks like i can externally drive it
[23:57:38] <brianonymous> buyin'
[23:57:40] <JakeSays> ya picky bastard
[23:58:23] <JakeSays> woo 1 mhz. it's a screamer!
