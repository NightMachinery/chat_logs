[16:00:38] <JTL> the amazon one? better than paying list price for ergotron when it's exactly the same :P
[16:00:41] <joepie91> this seems to be the cheapest suitable ergotron: https://www.megekko.nl/product/0/767425/Ergotron-LX-HD-Wall-Mount-Swing-Arm?r=tweakers.net&utm_source=tweakers.net&utm_medium=cpc

[19:30:21] <imMute> This reminds me of when I worked at the LED display mfgr and some customer wanted to put a wall of LED screens along part of a subway run, they wanted a very high frame rate so that they could "move" the advertisements with the train so it looked stationary to people on the train.
[19:31:01] <imMute> it would have been redicuously expensive with LEDs (and the frame rate needed probably wasn't possible either).  we told them to go buy some projectors from Christie and mount them on the trains - would work infinitely better
[19:32:53] <ThePendulum> hah, indeed
[19:33:05] <ThePendulum> did they have access to the trains though
[19:34:53] <imMute> I think it was the train authority that was the customer.  it was one of the requests that was "wow, no, that's not gonna work with today's technology unless you have $$$$$ for R&D"
[19:35:20] <joepie91> wasn't that actually built somewhere though
[19:35:25] <imMute> we got one or two of those a month - I always told the FAE to quote something like $50 Million so that they either fuck off or they fund the R&D to make it happen
[19:35:31] <imMute> joepie91: which one?
[19:35:51] <joepie91> I don't recall, but I vaguely recall seeing a system like this deployed in practice as a prototype
[19:36:21] <imMute> I'm pretty sure projectors on trains (to project on the tunnel wall) is a thing you can buy off the shelf from some integrator.
[19:36:40] <imMute> I woudln't be surprised if some tiny company got conned into doing the LED-on-the-wall with really high frame rate thing too.
