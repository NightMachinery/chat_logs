[02:13:48] <entuland> I suspect they set the line height _below_ a reasonable value (anything under 1.2em would result in overlapping lines when they wrap - whatever the reason they wrap for)
[02:14:52] <entuland> birkoff - in other words, you're probably using line height for the wrong purpose
[02:15:56] <entuland> you may as well be setting line-height with a non-font-size-dependent value of some kind, which may screw up with zoom
[02:16:10] <entuland> but as mentioned above, if you need help, share your code

[14:41:58] <entuland> cadmio, the three-em dash seems the longest supported by unicode: ⸻
[14:42:12] <lara99> entuland: is it possible? How?
[14:42:36] <entuland> lara99, you just need more keyframes likely
[14:43:03] <entuland> but not sure if it's going to be elegant / easy with arbitrary amounts of lines
[14:43:17] <lara99> entuland: why?
[14:43:49] <entuland> because you'd need a crapload of keyframes likely, it seems something you shouldn't try and tackle with pure CSS

[14:46:36] <entuland> it works
[14:46:41] <entuland> I just added lines and works just fine
[14:46:54] <entuland> no idea how it does it really, I thought it wasn't possible honestly
[14:46:57] *** Joins: fweht (uid404746@id-404746.tooting.irccloud.com)
[14:47:11] <entuland> oh wait, no, it fails
[14:47:24] <entuland> I added LIs up to 9, it cycles 1, 2, 3, 9
[14:47:58] <lara99> why?
[14:48:13] <entuland> it's probably matter of magic numbers in the frames, and I may have seen it right that it's not really easy to make it generic
[14:48:56] <lara99> the fact is that the list is obtained programmatically each time I add a word
[14:49:14] <entuland> yeah, you may just bite the bullet and do that via JS
[14:49:21] <entuland> after all I assume you already have JS
[14:50:45] <lara99> yes I have but I do not know how to do it
[14:51:18] <entuland> do you have an upper boundary of the amount of items?
[14:51:37] <entuland> actually, I now understand how that technique works, I think
[14:51:49] <entuland> it's matter of the animation-delay bound to nth-of-type
[14:52:39] <entuland> you _may_ be able to add such style inline to each LI as you add it, increasing the delay
[14:52:41] <lara99> a maximum of 40 to exaggerate
[14:52:41] *** Quits: otisolsen70 (~otisolsen@xd4ed80b5.cust.hiper.dk) (Quit: Leaving)
[14:52:58] <entuland> then you could pre fill that bunch of rules in the CSS up to 50 or so
[14:53:26] <entuland> but that's just a guess, you need to test it
[14:54:05] <entuland> likely better, as above, to just learn how to deal with these things with JS
[14:54:47] <entuland> it's just matter of messing with a single param such as top / margin-top / scrollTop depending on how you want to implement it
[14:54:53] <lara99> If I fill it then it leaves white steps?
[14:54:59] <entuland> no idea
[14:55:08] <entuland> I just half understood how that works
[14:55:13] <entuland> so you need to try it
[14:56:05] <entuland> if it works, you may try and make it somewhat more flexible with variables and calc
[14:56:31] <entuland> something like animation-delay: calc(2 * var(--my-delay));
[14:56:49] <entuland> so that you can change the speed of all the animation at once altering the delay variable in one single spot
[14:57:01] <lara99> :O
[14:57:02] <hassoon> 'morning
[14:58:12] <entuland> but seriously, this is more of a "cool tricks you can do with CSS" than something you may want to put in production, imo
[14:59:16] <lara99> :(  I need it as a sub header of the title of a website
[14:59:24] <lara99> to list the services
[15:02:09] <entuland> actually, you may as well consider using a library
[15:02:19] <entuland> after all, that's just a carousel
[15:02:39] <entuland> and there are carousel libraries that support arbitrary elements, they do not force you to use images
[15:02:42] <hassoon> lara99: do you want an infinite animation that scrolls with which the list items scroll ? or you want to scroll manually but the scroll stops gradually on another item ?
[15:03:17] <entuland> a proper library may also give you additional goodies such as stopping the animation when the user hovers, or letting them go back / forward in the series if so they wish
[15:03:20] <lara99> hasson: infinite
[15:03:45] <hassoon> lara99: infinite? so the user is not supposed to interact with the list and scroll ?
[15:03:47] <entuland> you don't want to frustrate your users with having to wait for line 2 after they missed it if the list is 40 or so long
[15:03:54] <hassoon> ^
[15:04:01] <lara99> it is more as a cool effect
[15:04:11] <lara99> than an explanation
[15:04:14] <entuland> you can't anticipate how they'll perceive it
[15:04:28] <hassoon> lara99: so you want a mere animated automatically self-scrolling list that just gives eye-candy effect for your website ,
[15:04:30] <lara99> it is just to say look at how many sevices
[15:04:30] <entuland> and no, that's not really a cool effect, I personally hate it
[15:04:36] <entuland> that's like the <marquee>
[15:05:16] <lara99> hasson: yes
[15:05:24] <entuland> video backgrounds that I can't control, carousels I can't stop that keep looping distracting me from reading text, blinking stuff, sliding banners of any kind
[15:05:25] <hassoon> entuland: that's like a news self-scrolling bar, they should use a carousel and the user just interacts with it
[15:05:28] <lara99> entuland: :(
[15:05:46] <entuland> yes, a carousel would be "okay", with proper UX
[15:06:06] <hassoon> lara99: what is this animated list made for anyway ?
[15:06:07] <lara99> entuland: it is only under the title
[15:06:21] <hassoon> lara99: use owl carousel
[15:06:34] <hassoon> lara99: it's a pretty famous and easy to user carousel library
[15:06:59] <entuland> lara99, you don't have to "sell" it to me :P it's okay, it's your website, you're free to do as you please - I'm just warning you that's really matter of tastes and you may just piss off someone with something they can't control
[15:07:27] <hassoon> lara99: it's a general purpose tool, you can use it for scrollable lists, for automatic self-scrolling lists, or whatever you want to make scrollable in a nice animated way, with touch support
[15:07:53] <hassoon> lara99: https://owlcarousel2.github.io/OwlCarousel2/
[15:07:56] <hassoon> start from there
[15:08:55] <lara99> hasson: it is horizontal
[15:08:57] <entuland> something like this, just one item at a time, and sliding vertical: https://owlcarousel2.github.io/OwlCarousel2/demos/autoplay.html
[15:09:05] <hassoon> lara99: you can make it vertical og course
[15:13:32] <hassoon> lara99: look here too https://codepen.io/marcogu00/pen/eLeWMq
[15:14:34] <lara99> I see a blank page
[15:14:48] <hassoon> what ?
[15:15:20] <lara99> no images
[15:15:26] <lara99> only a "v"
[15:16:55] <hassoon> lara99: doesn't matter, just look at the approach
[15:18:31] <hassoon> lara99: how about now https://ghanhass.github.io/myfiddle/351
[15:19:21] <lara99> I am trying with text
[15:19:23] <lara99> https://codepen.io/marcogu00/pen/eLeWMq
[15:19:39] <lara99> but it remains rotated at 90
[15:35:43] <lara99> I prefer the first solution honestly, I would only understand how to manually alter it to work correctly at each new li I add https://jsfiddle.net/utasir/e8mqgxcf/
[15:51:00] <entuland> it's not really a solution, it doesn't scale automatically (you need to mess with inline styling), it has timing quirks to get right: https://jsfiddle.net/entuland/k1v20qxw/
[15:51:21] <entuland> I'm not an expert on those techniques so there may be better ways, but as above, this is definitely not something I would put in production
[15:52:08] <entuland> I just hacked the above around to show you how you can half-simplify the code with variables
[15:52:41] <entuland> but you'll still need to update the number 5 in that inline styling of the UL that calculates the --total variable
[15:56:39] <lara99> thanks I make a few tests
[15:56:50] <entuland> yw
[16:01:38] <hassoon> lara99: check this https://codepen.io/hassoon/pen/mdmKWVX
[16:02:39] <entuland> ^ that, you should really be using a library like that

[19:34:09] <DPA> (basically, nth-last-child can be used to generate rules for a specific number of child elements, and nth-child can then be used to set rules for the n-th entry, such as the animation time offset.
[19:34:09] <DPA>  Generate those for any number of elements needed, and you won't need JS for starting/stopping the animations).

[21:18:23] <Rockwood> i think yes but not sure
[21:18:40] <entuland> just call updateButtons() when the scrollbar changes for whatever reason
[21:18:57] <Rockwood> how it would be?
[21:18:59] <entuland> this means you may as well remove the call to updateButtons() in the button handlers
[21:19:03] <entuland> not sure whether that would fire
[21:19:18] <entuland> we should really be discussing this in #javascript though
[21:19:34] <Rockwood> ok
[21:19:39] <Rockwood> i am moving there

[22:25:30] <DPA> hunboy: No, scss isn't JS at all. It's an independent CSS templating language. It generates pure CSS.
[22:26:07] <hunboy> based on JS yes, learn more about that.

[22:55:54] <FightingFalcon> Question: Is it good idea to place the nav bar (hamburger menu) on bottom in mobile?
[23:20:02] <theskillwithin> well sure on mobile then its closer to their thumb touching th escreen if holding in one hand
[23:20:19] <theskillwithin> but it depends, generally no
[23:21:19] <DPA> hunboy: I don't see how this is relevant, if it's even true at all, especially considering the language rather than the implementation.
[23:21:19] <DPA> Anyway, here is a posix shell rewrite of the previous scss code snipped, *now* there is no way anyone can claim it's not JS free! https://bpa.st/36HA
[23:37:43] <farn> hunboy: The primary implementation of Sass is written in Dart, not JS. It doesn't matter either way though when the concern is whether any JS needs to run on the client.
