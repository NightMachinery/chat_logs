[09:59:33] <sussudio> OsteHovel: there's guides to this on the internets, it involves things like remounting several /proc things, and changing the blkid in /etc/fstab, mounting the new drive as root, and then running grub.
[10:00:20] <OsteHovel> Sounds like it is easier to just reinstall Debian and copy files from backup instead
[10:00:50] <sussudio> !aptitude clone
[10:00:50] <dpkg> To clone a Debian machine using aptitude (or install your favourite packages) use aptitude search --disable-columns -F%p '~i!~M!~v' > package_list; on the reference machine; xargs aptitude --schedule-only install < package_list; aptitude install; on the other machine.  This preserves information about "automatically installed" packages that other methods do not.  See also <reinstall>, <things to backup>, <debian clone>, <apt-clone>.

[12:53:38] <Khepra> !frankendebian
[12:53:38] <dpkg> When you get random packages from random repositories, mix multiple releases of Debian, or mix Debian and derived distributions, you have a mess.  There's no way anyone can support this "distribution of Frankenstein" and #debian certainly doesn't want to even try. See https://wiki.debian.org/DontBreakDebian and <reinstall>
[12:54:15] <Lope> I love me a good old frankendebian
[12:54:17] <Khepra> Lope: also the practice is not clear from the womanpages. What I do, I force whole repo to -1 priority, then one by one package, of those that I'll need + deps, I override to priority 500
[12:54:24] <Lope> I should make it an official distro
[12:55:24] <Lope> interesting approach
[12:55:37] <Khepra> yeah otherwise all kinds of unexpected hilarity ensues
[12:55:54] <Lope> yeah, the weird thing is I installed linux-image-amd64 and linux-headers-amd64 from backports
[12:56:09] <Lope> but then unstable has a higher priority by default
[12:56:10] *** Joins: AimHere (~David@92.238.16.159)
[12:56:31] <Lope> so it automagically installs the unstable kernel, keeping backports headers.
[12:56:43] <Khepra> mmhm hm.
[12:56:54] <Lope> When it first did it, the headers were still compatible and it worked I was able to reboot.
[12:57:14] <Lope> BUt then the versions diverged, my initramfs failed, and it also decided to uninstall zfs hahaha
[12:57:16] <Lope> was a fun time.
[12:57:25] <Khepra> dpkg also has one very dumb and annoying habit, it seems. apparently, if you installed a package from backports once, but later uninstalled, it'll continue to think you wanted upgrades to that package from backports.
[12:57:26] <dpkg> Khepra: You are person #1 to send an unparseable request
[12:57:33] <Lope> cos I didn't pay attention to the upgrade stuff I semi-automated it.

[12:58:39] <Lope> what's the new code name? does it have a repo?

[18:10:46] <Khepra> have rescue system available in case you have to rebuild that initramfs, or else you'll be locked out
[18:11:13] <Lope> Khepra, ok I touched them all. No warnings.

[18:56:57] <dpkg> Newer kernels for Debian stable releases are available from the <bullseye-backports> repository.  After modifying your sources.list, run «apt update».  To install the current backported kernel: «apt -t bullseye-backports install linux-image-`uname -r|sed 's,[^-]*-[^-]*-,,'`».

[23:54:10] <shibboleth> does interfaces/ifupdown have some magic for changing variables? iface is getting xx.xx.xx.foo, proper gateway will always be .1

[23:57:11] <somiaj> well the magic way is write a script to do it. I wonder if you could use post-up to bring up new interfaces, so instead of having the interface come up automatically, bring up the interface in a post-up script from the interface you need to wait for the gateway to
[23:57:43] <randall> The proper approach should be to set it correctly via DHCP server.
[23:57:46] <somiaj> this way there won't be a race condition, because this interace won't come up until after the first one is up

[23:58:12] <somiaj> (this is from a converastion a few hours ago)
[23:59:32] <somiaj> though here I think the interfaces file might not be the best tool for the job, they didn't like my suggestion of networkd, which might be able to better handle this
