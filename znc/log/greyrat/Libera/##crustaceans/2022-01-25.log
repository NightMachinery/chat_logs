[05:52:52] <manicennui> Do tell.
[05:54:37] <imode> y2goat
[05:54:48] <imode> "There is no Goat Ops."
[05:55:32] <manicennui> I just learned how much Thoreau upset normies.
[05:55:36] <manicennui> Now I like him even more.
[05:55:50] <manicennui> Scottish author Robert Louis Stevenson judged Thoreau's endorsement of living alone and apart from modern society in natural simplicity to be a mark of "unmanly" effeminacy and "womanish solitude", while deeming him a self-indulgent "skulker".
[05:56:47] <manicennui> In a similar vein, poet John Greenleaf Whittier detested what he deemed to be the "wicked" and "heathenish" message of Walden, claiming that Thoreau wanted man to "lower himself to the level of a woodchuck and walk on four legs".
[05:57:49] <manicennui> In response to such criticisms, English novelist George Eliot, writing for the Westminster Review, characterized such critics as uninspired and narrow-minded:
[05:57:49] <manicennui> People‚Äîvery wise in their own eyes‚Äîwho would have every man's life ordered according to a particular pattern, and who are intolerant of every existence the utility of which is not palpable to them, may pooh-pooh Mr. Thoreau and this episode in his history, as unpractical and dreamy.

[06:45:07] <cb> it was a small scale one
[06:45:54] <manicennui> I think most people are thinking more like have a few acres with a few goats.
[06:46:03] <manicennui> Nothing commercial
[06:46:42] <imode> just the idea of goatops is hilarious to me.

[15:08:14] <kline> riv, yeah, someone in my rss reader pointed out that the difference between the sum of two square roots is PSPACE
[15:08:19] <kline> ie even worse than NP hard
[15:09:03] <kline> real life it doesnt matter a jot unless you're doing extremely high precision stuff, at which point you should be using better tools
[15:22:36] <riv> is that in modular arithmetic I guess?
[15:26:58] <kline> i have no idea where you need to do infinite-precision differences of square-roots
[15:27:22] <edk> do you have a link
[15:27:27] <edk> i feel like there's probably some nuance being lost
[15:27:30] <kline> the key thing that makes it pspace is that to compare any number with infinite precision requires you to necessarily take up to infinite time to continue down the path to find the first differing digit
[15:28:08] <kline> https://shlegeris.com/2018/10/23/sqrt.html
[15:28:08] <buttsbot> A surprisingly hard CS problem: sums of square roots
[15:30:28] <kline> im unconvinced its really that interesting a problem for anyone but the overlap of mathematicians and computer scientists
[15:31:09] <edk> so computer scientists, morally
[15:31:59] <kline> i mean, is it really interesting to computer scientists that transcendental numbers, in the worst case, take infinite time to compare?
[15:32:22] <edk> well, no
[15:32:25] <kline> i think it's pretty much accepted, and its only really of note to people wanting to specifically apply computing to math
[15:32:38] <edk> but this isn't infinite or about transcendental numbers
[15:32:43] <edk> also, pedantically, everything in NP is also in PSPACE
[15:33:36] <edk> there's a big difference between things that are known to be impossible to solve in NP and things that just nobody has bothered to
[15:33:39] <kline> see, im not good at maths, but i really understand this as boiling down to "some numbers require infinite digits to represent, so you may have to go infinitely down the line to find the first digit they do/do not differ at"
[15:34:03] <edk> but you don't need to think about them as digits at all
[15:34:04] <kline> the rest about square roots etc is just dressing
[15:35:04] <edk> the number 1/3 takes infinite digits to represent
[15:36:03] <kline> mhmm
[15:36:45] <edk> it's not hard to reason about, though, and square roots aren't much worse
[15:39:51] <kline> yeah, it feels like this is a bit about applying the wrong tools to the problem

[16:33:40] <kline> a post*
[16:34:19] <edk> i think it's probably true that nobody has done it more efficiently
[16:35:10] <edk> the obvious techniques for working with exact values that can be square roots don't lend themselves to a less-than-exponential solution
[16:36:12] <edk> but square roots are quite well-behaved in general and i wouldn't be surprised if there was a way
[16:36:42] <edk> they're not particularly weird as irrational numbers go
[16:38:02] <riv> one thing about square roots is that they have a repeating continued fraction
[16:38:13] <riv> cube roots and other higher degree algebraic numbers do not
[16:39:52] <riv> kind of like how rationals have repeating digits and irrationals dont
[16:40:34] <edk> the problem with sums of square roots is that although they are algebraic their degree grows exponentially
[16:41:21] <riv> oh right, sqrt(2) + sqrt(3) is degree 4
[16:44:13] <kline> man, id love to have 4 degrees, maybe one of them would be in number theory so i could understand this
[16:44:51] <Geekingfrog> :D
[16:55:47] <mgdm> kline: that's how I feel any time I do any Haskell

[19:07:35] <indigo> Whew, I have a meeting block from 8-1:25 today
[19:11:56] <defect> my condolences
[19:15:15] <indigo> defect: https://imgflip.com/i/62mcv5
[19:15:16] <buttsbot> Ralph in danger - Imgflip
[19:17:56] <indigo> It's the natural progression of software engineer; you start out with a pretty decent velocity, shipping a bunch of projects, and then the meetings start to happen
[19:18:20] <Geekingfrog> more impact !
[19:34:36] <bontaq> high impact meetings only
[19:36:22] <manicennui> We need to have more meeting to discuss all of the work that we don't have time to do because of meetings.
[19:36:32] <indigo> Pretty much!
[19:37:06] <defect> indigo: again, my condolences
[19:37:22] <indigo> Hehehe
[19:37:27] <indigo> Thank you defect
[19:37:33] <manicennui> I wonder whether everyone being remote will eventually lead companies to cut some fat in the middle.
[19:38:26] <manicennui> It's made it kind of obvious that some people don't really have much to do when they can't bug people in person all day.
[19:42:07] <manicennui> https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-25/nvidia-is-said-to-quietly-prepare-to-abandon-takeover-of-arm
[19:42:07] <buttsbot> Bloomberg - Are you a robot?
[19:42:15] <gwozniak> I must live a charmed existence because nearly every job I've had, the amount of time spent in meetings each day, on average, has been remarkably small
[19:43:29] <defect> i'm still fairly blessed with not that many meetings either
[19:44:00] <manicennui> I'm pulled into everything.
[19:44:06] <gwozniak> I have about 3-4 hours a week of scheduled meetings, most of which are actually useful
[19:44:26] <manicennui> And my manager loves to entertain ideas for things we might do 6 months from now and talk about them the moment people bring them up.
[19:45:16] <manicennui> Google tells me that I have 9.1 hours of meetings this week and my average is 9.6.
[19:45:52] <manicennui> The biggest problem is that they are often scheduled with short periods of time in between that I can't really use to do real work.
[19:46:46] <manicennui> I also declined another hour of meetings this week, and I have an hour with three overlapping meetings.
[19:47:23] <defect> i think i'm just not important enough. i have ~3 hours of meetings this week
[19:47:51] <indigo> gwozniak: Generally what happens with me is that I start out with very little meetings, and then I get added to more and more projects
[19:48:21] <manicennui> A lot of my meetings run over too.
[19:48:23] <defect> we also have the notion of "focus block" in our calendar tool. which highlights and tracks uninterrupted sections of time to focus on shit
[19:48:33] <defect> i've been appreciating that
[19:48:35] <manicennui> Or I get pulled into impromptu meetings.
[19:48:46] <manicennui> I'd say my actual time spent in meetings is closer to 15 hours per week.
[19:49:01] <manicennui> Focus on meetings.
[19:49:57] <manicennui> On Thursday I have 4 hours of meetings. During one hour I have the three overlapping meetings, and I also declined a 30 minute meeting.
[19:50:57] <gwozniak> My manager's day is pretty much all meetings.  I suspect he gets pulled in to everything, shielding us
[19:51:53] <manicennui> We are in a weird situation where we don't really benefit from being part of a larger company, but the larger company is super dependent on us.
[19:52:10] <manicennui> I have no idea what the layers of management above us actually do.
[19:52:58] <manicennui> They have actually gotten rid of a couple layers, which is surprising.
[19:53:19] <manicennui> There was a senior manager in SE above my manager, and a director above that manager. Both levels are gone now.
[19:53:32] <indigo> gwozniak: That's super nice. Generally I'm juggling ideas/feature requests from my manager, the PM, backend and frontend team members
[19:53:53] <manicennui> There is now a higher level director over parts of SE and other things.
[19:54:03] <manicennui> And my manager reports directly to her.
[19:56:23] <manicennui> Nvidia has told partners that it doesn‚Äôt expect the transaction to close, according to one person, who asked not to be identified because the discussions are private. SoftBank, meanwhile, is stepping up preparations for an Arm initial public offering as an alternative to the Nvidia takeover, another person said.
[19:58:19] <indigo> gwozniak: What I've noticed is that my team/company values ideas a lot more than execution, so sometimes it's just a whole bunch of meetings about stuff that is designed and in progress with "I wonder..." and "it would be interesting if..."
[19:58:51] <gwozniak> Yeah, we don't get too much of that here
[19:59:30] <gwozniak> Most of our meetings are to work out problems and design things
[20:00:25] <gwozniak> The manager of my manager is the person who talks to other business units and some sales/support people to get a feel for what features we should be considering
[20:00:33] <gwozniak> My manager does a bit of that too
[20:01:03] <manicennui> A lot of my meetings are people who don't need to be involved in projects being brought up to speed.
[20:01:21] <indigo> It's also possible that you've been working on a project for half a year and then your project gets cancelled or reprioritized ;-)
[20:01:41] <manicennui> We don't work on much of anything for that long.
[20:01:46] <manicennui> At least not as a single project.
[20:02:22] <indigo> That's nice too. I've been working on some projects for a year+ without launch
[20:02:38] <gwozniak> The trick for us is convincing the hardware people that we don't know ahead of time how much of an improvement an optimization will have
[20:02:47] <manicennui> It is, but our priorities also shift constantly.
[20:05:07] <indigo> I'm fine with shifting priorities as long as something gets shipped every quarter
[20:06:28] <manicennui> We ship something every day.
[20:06:45] <indigo> That's really nice
[20:08:56] <indigo> I spent yesterday deleting a bunch of code, so that was fun. We spent a quarter building something without product requirements and lo and behold, now we have to rewrite a lot of it
[20:09:27] <indigo> We were busy though!!
[20:09:40] <gwozniak> Keep typing!
[20:10:03] <indigo> Yeah pretty much. "but the requirements aren't ready" "yeah but can't you start building it??"
[20:10:30] <manicennui> Yay! Another meeting!
[20:10:36] <gwozniak> indigo: heh - just had a taste of that today
[20:11:09] <manicennui> We released 9 PRs yesterday.
[20:11:20] <manicennui> That's just the main monolith for our product.
[20:12:11] <gwozniak> Some BU pushed for a somewhat tricky feature about 6 months ago, so we just added it last month and, lo and behold, there are some odd integration problems with it and it turns out the BU only kinda sorta wanted it
[20:13:06] <indigo> Hahah great
[20:13:39] <manicennui> # Ruby 3.1
[20:13:39] <manicennui> { a:, b: } #=> { a: 1, b: 2 }
[20:13:42] <manicennui> Eww.
[20:13:44] <manicennui> Why?
[20:13:55] <gwozniak> Adding different codegen features (which is what this was) always produces weird things you basically can't forsee.  We know this, but convincing others of it is hard
[20:14:08] <manicennui> The missing context here is that 1 and 2 are really the values from variables named a and b.
[20:14:28] <manicennui> But I hate this kind of implicit code to save a few keystrokes.
[20:15:13] <gwozniak> Yeah, that's not actually any clearer to me
[20:17:15] <gwozniak> My Ruby knowledge is basically 0, but the form on the left looks like a dict/table with no values and only keys
[20:17:30] <manicennui> Yeah.
[20:18:00] <gwozniak> I would be rather surprised to find out that they actually had a value, if I were just looking at it unprompted
[20:18:03] <manicennui> But it is sugar for this: { a: a, b: b }
[20:18:35] <manicennui> I just don't understand increasing the size of the language to save keystrokes and make things slightly less clear.
[20:18:57] <manicennui> I'll never understand the obsession that a lot of developers have for saving keystrokes and writing terse code.
[20:18:57] <buttsbot> üëè developers üëè developers üëè developers üëè
[20:19:25] <gwozniak> I mean, yeah, code can be too verbose, but...
[20:20:42] <gwozniak> lol - because of this BU silliness, we may be in a position where we remove the feature for this version (which is going to be certified by an outside party) that we were explicitly told to put in
[20:21:12] <indigo> Features are legos!!! Why is it broken??
[20:33:23] <manicennui> Wow. Ford makes a pickup that starts just under $20k.
[20:33:31] <manicennui> https://www.ford.com/trucks/maverick/
[20:33:37] <manicennui> I didn't think that vehicles like this still existed.
[20:34:23] <companion_cube> why buy that when you can buy an expensive landcruiser^W F150 ?
[20:35:58] <prussian> take out the read two doors and replace them with jump seats and make the bed longer and it looks good.
[20:36:54] <companion_cube> put a jacuzzi on the bed
[20:40:06] <prussian> seems like an accident in the making
[20:41:43] <manicennui> Looks like about $25k to get it with AWD (no 4WD available as far as I can see).
[20:42:52] <manicennui> Would have to compare it to similar SUVs with large amounts of cargo space.
[20:43:19] <manicennui> Everything else they sell seems far more expensive though.
[20:43:24] <companion_cube> hmm how does AWD differ from 4WD ?
[20:43:26] <manicennui> Only SUV around $20k is small.
[20:44:09] <manicennui> companion_cube: I don't know how well I could explain it. I've watched entire videos about it.
[20:44:20] <manicennui> I think the main takeaway is that AWD is better for everyday driving.
[20:44:38] <manicennui> And 4WD is better for serious off-roading and utility.
[20:45:09] <manicennui> 4WD is usually (always?) part-time, meaning you can turn it off.
[20:47:05] <manicennui> https://www.caranddriver.com/features/a27630736/awd-vs-4wd/
[20:47:06] <buttsbot> AWD vs. 4WD Explained
[20:47:32] <manicennui> "AWD is optimized for on-road use. It has the capability to send the engine's power to all four tires all of the time. It will help keep your vehicle moving forward better than front-wheel drive or rear-wheel drive on snow-covered or rain-slicked roads."
[20:47:43] <companion_cube> heh, I'll jsut consider them as "mostly the same"
[20:47:44] <manicennui> "Intended only for use off-road or on extremely slippery surfaces, 4WD is a part-time system, meaning the driver must shift into and out of four-wheel drive by turning a knob, pushing a button, or yanking a lever. Doing so locks the front and rear driveshafts together, keeping the front and rear axles turning at the same speed."
[20:47:52] <companion_cube> the difference seems irrelevant to my use cases
[20:48:55] <manicennui> I do think that vehicles use more fuel when they are AWD or 4WD is engaged.
[20:49:35] <manicennui> I'm not aware of any vehicles where you have the option to get both.
[20:49:52] <Brekkjern> More mechanical complexity means more ineficciencies in power transmission
[20:49:56] <manicennui> companion_cube: I think it matters in this case because 4WD is something one might want on a pickup depending on how you plan to use it.
[20:50:42] <manicennui> companion_cube: The AWD is nice to make driving in the winter better, but overall it has a fairly low towing capacity and load limit, and the AWD makes it somewhat less useful as a work truck, depending on what you are doing.
[20:51:00] <manicennui> It is basically a pickup on an SUV frame.
[20:51:21] <manicennui> The main thing that makes it attractive is its price really.
[20:51:57] <manicennui> It could be nice if you want an everyday driver but also want to be able to bring back larger things from Home Depot.
[20:52:17] <manicennui> An SUV should be about as good for that, but Ford's SUVs are all more expensive.
[20:53:32] <companion_cube> manicennui: the question is why you'd want a pickup truck
[20:53:40] <manicennui> companion_cube: To put things in the bed.
[20:53:51] <manicennui> In this case that's about it.
[20:53:53] <companion_cube> I mean, ok. that can be useful once every other month
[20:53:54] <manicennui> And it is cheaper.
[20:54:03] <manicennui> But I think you know the real reason in the US.
[20:54:26] <manicennui> companion_cube: Yeah, I don't think it is something you'd get to live an urban life.
[20:54:40] <manicennui> companion_cube: But it is something that interests me as a starter vehicle if I buy some land.
[21:00:10] <manicennui> WTF
[21:00:25] <manicennui> Tickets to the Biltmore estate are $86 most of the year.
[21:00:34] <manicennui> Who pays $86 to see some rich person's former home?
[21:00:51] <manicennui> I like a lot of the architecture and gardens, but I wouldn't pay that much to see it in person.
[21:01:09] <companion_cube> in the US it's to show how big your dick is, yes
[21:01:13] <companion_cube> I judge people so hard
[21:01:24] <companion_cube> when I see a gigantic F150 with shiny paint and obviously no real use
[21:01:41] <manicennui> Walmart rednecks
[21:03:17] <manicennui> Live in a shitty suburban hellscape, be a toxic fan of the local sportsball team, work some shitty office job, but you have a pickup and a Confederate flag so people know that you are a Real American!
[21:03:46] <Geekingfrog> the american dream !
[21:04:06] <manicennui> Pose with your firearms on Facebook
[21:05:39] <companion_cube> how is it even possible to show a confederate flag and be a real american
[21:05:47] <manicennui> It's just another lifestyle that is the product of marketing.
[21:06:02] <manicennui> companion_cube: How dare you.
[21:07:22] <companion_cube> they should give me citizenship and kick these assholes out :p
[21:07:27] <manicennui> For extra irony, have a Confederate and Nazi flag.
[21:07:35] <manicennui> companion_cube: And send them where?
[21:07:47] <Geekingfrog> guantanamo ?
[21:07:58] <manicennui> We should give Guantanamo back to Cuba.
[21:10:13] <manicennui> Maybe we can pay Australia to take them.
[21:10:54] <manicennui> companion_cube: Don't plan to go back to France?
[21:15:01] <companion_cube> not particularly soon, no
[21:15:06] <prussian> You aren't a real american until you have an F150 Raptor or at least a F250 Turbo Diesel that's lifted a few inches.
[21:15:12] <prussian> duh...
[21:15:23] <companion_cube> not even sure if you're making that up :D
[21:15:55] <prussian> still a cool truck. I'd look into it, but the full size cab kills it for me.
[21:16:03] <prussian> not sure who this truck is for
[21:16:17] <prussian> i guess it's the SUV of Trucks as stated earlier. meh
[21:17:16] <ngoldbaum> i want to live in the universe where this tweet is a punchline of an it‚Äôs always sunny episode https://twitter.com/cherylhines/status/1486002123280199684
[21:17:16] <buttsbot> Twitter - cherylhines - My husband‚Äôs reference to Anne Frank at a mandate rally in D.C. was reprehensible and insensitive. The atrocities that mill...
[21:17:28] <manicennui> prussian: Ignoring all of the Walmart rednecks who will buy it, I think the price is the only thing that makes it worth considering if you need the cargo space.
[21:18:17] <prussian> ya I guess.
[21:18:18] <manicennui> Who is she married to?
[21:18:22] <prussian> such a small ass bed though
[21:18:46] <manicennui> prussian: Sure. You might be able to find a cheap SUV from someone else who gives you the cargo space you need.
[21:18:54] <manicennui> Ford doesn't offer anything though.
[21:19:11] <manicennui> The only thing close in price is this: https://www.ford.com/suvs-crossovers/ecosport/?gnav=header-suvs-vhp
[21:19:39] <prussian> just wondering how bad it is though given it's "base" 20k
[21:19:45] <prussian> the truck
[21:19:59] <manicennui> prussian: Not sure. I only watched one video and the people reviewed it favorably.
[21:20:07] <manicennui> Who knows what long term reliability will be like.
[21:20:25] <prussian> I really should have gotten something like that, or at least a ranger.
[21:20:35] <prussian> Sedan is cool and all 99.999% of the time
[21:20:36] <manicennui> They said it was quiet in the cabin and the materials didn't seem overly cheap.
[21:20:40] <manicennui> It was just no frills.
[21:20:47] <prussian> but good luck shoving anything in it.
[21:20:48] <prussian> ya
[21:20:53] <prussian> sounds good
[21:21:33] <manicennui> The standard hybrid engine also gets decent mileage.

[21:30:54] <prussian> are iPhones actually any good?
[21:31:43] <indigo> I like mine :)
[21:32:31] <prussian> never had one. getting tired of this android shit though.
[21:34:25] <manicennui> prussian: They are both annoying in different ways.
[21:34:37] <manicennui> I can't remember the last time either released a feature that I gave a shit about.
[21:34:44] <prussian> maybe I should just get a pine phone then
[21:34:44] <manicennui> But they do love to change shit and add more bloat.
[21:34:45] <prussian> fuck it
[21:35:13] <manicennui> I like my Pixel 3 more than any other phone I've used in the last few years.
[21:35:28] <manicennui> I don't know that the Pixel 6 is really comparable.
[21:35:45] <manicennui> Just seems more expensive for a bunch of crap I don't care about.
[21:35:53] <prussian> of all the android phones I've gone through, samsung seemed to be the only ones that went the whole 4 years without breaking somehow.
[21:35:53] <manicennui> And I don't really want a larger phone.
[21:36:01] <prussian> same
[21:36:31] <prussian> I tried big phones with the note, and it's just comically large. easy to type on? sure, that's about it though.
[21:40:54] <manicennui> I have a Pixel 3 from work and an iPhone 12 mini.
[21:41:01] <manicennui> The mini is just a bit too small.
[21:41:09] <manicennui> But I prefer using the Pixel.
[21:41:47] <manicennui> I also tried a Motorola moto g power for a while. It was okay.
[21:43:11] <manicennui> Oh, she is married to Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

[21:50:53] <prussian> people just do
[21:51:19] <prussian> more amazingly, they can do things like drive, wipe their ass, hell, even be productive members of society.
[21:51:30] <prussian> weird stuff
[21:52:17] <manicennui> prussian: Everyone likes to pretend like it is just poor uneducated people being fooled by Fox News.
[21:52:33] <manicennui> RFK Jr. had every advantage in life.
[21:52:34] <prussian> if only
[21:52:52] <manicennui> Since 2005, he has promoted the scientifically discredited idea that vaccines cause autism,[4] and is founder and chairman of Children's Health Defense, an anti-vaccine advocacy group.[5]
[21:52:57] <prussian> my mom's current husband is all up in this shit and he is an educated turbopump draft engineer
[21:53:02] <prussian> it's just the way it goes
[21:53:09] <prussian> what a brotha knows
[21:53:27] <prussian> personally, I'm convinced most of it is just surface level us v them sports team thing.
[21:57:55] <prussian> manicennui: this RFK Jr. guy sounds like a hero
[21:58:24] <manicennui> It's especially sad considering who his father was.
[21:58:40] <prussian> rebel against
[21:58:43] <prussian> rise against even
[21:59:20] <prussian> I'm at the point where people say antivaxx shit, I just say, "ya man, so true....." and tell people to just fake their vaxx card. Like fuck it.
[21:59:30] <prussian> done
[22:00:34] <manicennui> I don't really encounter antivaxxers in person.
[22:00:56] <prussian> it's about 50/50 at work alone lol
[22:01:25] <manicennui> I guess there was the antivaxxer at work who caused some drama, but I don't really interact with him.
[22:01:37] <manicennui> And most people I work with thought he was nuts.
[22:04:16] <prussian> sounds about right.
[22:11:29] <indigo> I got two engineers to work on my project this quarter... and then they got different priorities :P fun
[22:14:35] <Geekingfrog> not enough alignment meetings indigo
[22:26:19] <indigo> Clearly
[22:30:40] <manicennui> Can we put a quick meeting on our calendars to discuss how to better collaborate in meetings?
[22:35:03] <companion_cube> manicennui: you'd meet more of them in person
[22:35:07] <companion_cube> if you hanged out in the ICU :)
[22:35:25] <manicennui> I'm not cool enough to hang out in the ICU.

[22:52:27] <manicennui> We know the US never will.
[22:55:44] <Geekingfrog> Are you anti progress and anti innovation manicennui ? /s
[22:56:02] <manicennui> Let me know when we do those things.
[22:56:08] <riv> 3 years?
[22:56:10] <Geekingfrog> :D
[22:56:17] <riv> that's crazy they actually made a statement
[22:56:28] <manicennui> riv: Still better than most Android phone makers.
[22:56:31] <riv> they basically admitting that this block of rare earth metals is actually disposable
[22:56:51] <manicennui> riv: The thing that pisses me off is pretending like it is somehow good for users.
[22:56:56] <Geekingfrog> I think it's more about getting more money with this strategy than with others.
[22:57:01] <Geekingfrog> externalities !!!
[22:57:02] <riv> yeah
[22:57:10] <riv> it's that evil corpo crap where they state everything as a positive
[22:57:18] <riv> but this is a really bad thing for the environment
[22:57:19] <manicennui> "You're having a good experience, user!"
[22:57:33] <riv> because they can't be bothered updating software, they are bricking hardware
[22:57:40] <manicennui> riv: It's dumb for numerous reasons, but that is a big one.
[22:57:53] <riv> which makes the effort of mining finite resources we have, wasted
[22:58:01] <manicennui> Like the whole idea that people should spend nearly $1k on a phone every couple of years is asinine.
[22:58:13] <riv> it's horrible
[22:58:19] <manicennui> And it would be nice if we could keep using devices that might finally be stable.
[22:58:26] <manicennui> Instead of beta testing each new device for them.
[22:58:31] <riv> we've had the slow unfolding plastic disaster from the last decades
[22:58:38] <riv> and now we have this new one
[22:58:43] <manicennui> That is why I'm hoping the EU will do something.
[22:58:50] <riv> I really hope so too
[22:58:56] <manicennui> They kind of improved the AC adapter situation.
[22:58:56] <riv> it's quite sad
[22:59:05] <riv> what happened with that?
[22:59:05] <manicennui> Although Apple still does whatever they want.
[22:59:47] <manicennui> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_external_power_supply
[22:59:47] <buttsbot> Common external power supply - Wikipedia
[22:59:48] <Geekingfrog> I think the EU decided that usb-C will be the standard way to charge stuff going forward. Not sure what does that mean practically though
[23:00:21] <bontaq`> apple gets a new dongle?
[23:00:29] *** bontaq` is now known as bontaq
[23:01:09] <manicennui> I think Apple just made it so you need a different cable from the adapter to the phone.
[23:01:14] <manicennui> For no good reason.
[23:01:30] <manicennui> USB-C is barely bigger than lightning.
[23:03:33] <riv> uuugh
[23:03:42] <riv> standards exist for a reason
[23:04:34] <manicennui> I think I'm also the only one who hates their magnetic wireless charger.
[23:05:45] <manicennui> But I don't end up charging my phone often, and don't generally care if it charges somewhat faster because it is aligned perfectly.
