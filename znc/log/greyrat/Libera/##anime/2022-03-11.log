[01:13:38] <Berlin36> legends say that once you enter Vim, there is no way out
[01:14:43] <hok7z> No,use :q or :q!

[01:16:19] <Berlin36> hok7z: have you used emacs?
[01:16:44] <hok7z> No
[01:16:59] <hok7z> I use Neo(Vim) is Fork Vim
[01:17:29] <Berlin36> console text editors are confusing
[01:17:48] <Berlin36> especially because you need to remember hotkeys lol
[01:21:12] <boogiepop> too much extra complexity for me, it's not like anyone actually needs the efficiency of kb shortcuts unless youre a super mega programmer that never stops to think

[01:29:22] <Berlin36> LiveServer (if i remember correctly the name) is an extension for site creators, it setups a localserver that will display live changes in your website code
[01:29:27] <hok7z> Now with neovim plugins we can create our own editor simillar to vscode 
[01:31:24] <Berlin36> interesting, also i'd like to point out that vscode is pretty demanding on ram, neovim has to be less demanding since it's a console editor

[06:48:23] <ButterNoodle> its 2008 all over again
[06:48:30] <MootPoot> the price goes up in spikes and down in steps
[06:48:35] <Roey> it's 1978 over again
[06:48:37] <ButterNoodle> incorrect MootPoot

[06:49:07] <Nanobot> It's noon. Why is Calli slippin?
[06:49:52] <ButterNoodle> I mean the spikes are when we are at war in the middle ease, or an oil baron is in office
[06:50:07] <ButterNoodle> or a democrat is in office
[06:50:21] <ButterNoodle> or cooperate greed goes unchecked

[06:51:54] <Nanobot> I remember when there was some oil company person as a guest on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart, and he asked her whether it makes sense that that gas prices go up when supply drops, and gas prices also go up when supply rises. She said yes and was confused about why people would find that odd.
[06:52:14] <MootPoot> Nanobot: its like new york real estate
[06:52:25] <MootPoot> supply down or up, price always goes up
[06:52:39] <ButterNoodle> Nanobot: u do forget the goal of gas pricing... 
[06:52:58] <MootPoot> the goal is fucking me in the ass
[06:53:03] <MootPoot> not nicely either
[06:53:07] <ButterNoodle> its to make the gas companies so rich that they literally cant burn the money fast enough to make room for all the money they are making

[10:36:18] <amigojapan> ah ok I stand corrected
[10:36:34] <MootPoot> so turns out I installed it through AUR with YAY but I didnt know that pacman update did not also upgrade AUR packages

[10:39:11] <MootPoot> or do you have to build them
[10:39:36] <MootPoot> so its basically a VM right?
[10:39:42] <amigojapan> it uses a package manager called pkg
[10:40:01] <MootPoot> I know about termux
[10:40:02] <amigojapan> no its not a vm, it runs natively

[10:42:03] <Sapphirus> Computer, but I suppose I could connect it to a phone if Arch were running there.
[10:42:23] <amigojapan> except this needs arm64 packages
[10:42:33] <Sapphirus> Yeah, this solution would work for that.
[10:42:41] <amigojapan> ah good good
[10:43:26] <Sapphirus> I do it this was because I got sick and tired of rebuilding the same packages multiple times 
[10:43:31] <Sapphirus> this way*
[10:43:40] <amigojapan> I see
[10:43:47] <ButterNoodle> local repo.. as in a folder where u do ur own builds
[10:44:17] <Sapphirus> no, ButterNoodle, this is an actual pacman repo hosted on a local webserver.
[10:44:25] <MootPoot> does arch have like
[10:44:29] <MootPoot> performance modes or something
[10:44:30] <MootPoot> idk
[10:44:32] <ButterNoodle> so where do you do ur builds
[10:44:39] <MootPoot> "toggle this flag for max perf"
[10:44:48] <MootPoot> or aggressive cpu c-states
[10:44:56] <Sapphirus> Inside the build environment in the virtual machine hosting the repo, ButterNoodle.
[10:45:05] <amigojapan> MootPoot: there  is a command called nice'
[10:45:14] <Sapphirus> Then it gets distributed to all of my machines through pacman.
[10:45:32] <Sapphirus> well rather pacman pulls the packages, but yeah.
[10:45:39] <ButterNoodle> ur doing a mirror of core/extra/community?
[10:45:40] <amigojapan> MootPoot: nice level determines how aggressive it is
[10:46:20] <Sapphirus> ButterNoodle, no, I'm literally doing my own custom repository with my own packages in it instead of using a pacman front-end for the AUR
[10:46:34] <ButterNoodle> I get it
[10:46:43] <Sapphirus> Not doing a mirror or anything.

[14:21:33] <lastonestanding> MootPoot: doesn't it have anti missile flares?
[14:22:15] <MootPoot> some do, some dont , also even if it did that does not mean the pilot saw it coming
[14:22:21] <MootPoot> it depends on what block it is
[14:22:30] <MootPoot> block = aircraft version
[14:22:59] <MootPoot> it would also need a RWR or something to even know the missile was incoming

[14:23:09] <lastonestanding> JesseDesu: how does he make those animations?
[14:23:56] <MootPoot> lastonestanding: even if it had all those things that is still not a gurantee of anything - that missile is launched from a MANPAD - a single human firing the missile. Usually at the ranges that those are fired, flares wont really help you in a helicopter
[14:24:12] <MootPoot> those systems are fired about 1-1.5km away
[14:24:36] <MootPoot> by the time the pilot gets a warning its maybe 1km or 700m away, at which point it'll hit in ~2 seconds
[14:24:58] <lastonestanding> I see
[14:24:59] <lastonestanding> then maybe the pilot should not fly that low
[14:25:15] <MootPoot> he was probably doing it to avoid larger anti-air systems - the radar ones
[14:25:17] <MootPoot> S-400s
[14:25:28] <lastonestanding> ohh

[14:27:42] <MootPoot> lastonestanding: so its a choice of either you WILL get shot down up high, or maybe if you get liucky you can fly low and hope nobody is on the ground
[14:28:09] <MootPoot> tbh they don't really use helicopters in areas where anti air is a threat, helicopters are kind of weak against that
[14:28:14] <MootPoot> very weak
[14:28:38] <lastonestanding> could they even take a black hawk down?
[14:28:42] <MootPoot> with a jet you can drop your flare and by the time the missile comes close you have pulled away enough for it to safely explode 
[14:28:53] <MootPoot> since you're filying at 600kmph or so
[14:28:59] <MootPoot> or even higher
[14:29:03] <MootPoot> lastonestanding: easily
[14:29:41] <MootPoot> if you're close enough to the launcher and you are relatively slow like any helicopter flares really wont help you much
[14:30:18] <MootPoot> and even less if they have radar tracking missiles rather then IR tracking - flares are useless against those

[17:51:43] <isekaijin> Interesting.
[17:53:02] <isekaijin> Mmm, it doesn't seem to have the ability to type by swiping the pen on the tablet.
[17:53:11] <isekaijin> Which is the important feature that I actually need.

[17:54:20] <Bco1981> why is that a requirement ?... you don't do that on a real keyboard?
[17:55:16] <Bco1981> look, either get a tablet and use it as a tablet... or... get a computer, and use it as a computer.

[17:56:32] <isekaijin> I would love to use a tablet, but they have shit battery life when playing games.
[17:56:50] <isekaijin> As a matter of fact, I installed Windows primarily to play a *phone* game.
[17:57:03] <isekaijin> Because playing the game on my phone turned it into a handheld stove.
[17:57:29] <Bco1981> yeah... phones arn't gaming devices... get a steam deck, and use your tablet as a tablet.
[17:58:27] <isekaijin> I don't have a tablet in the sense of, say, an iPad or a Surface.
[17:58:49] <isekaijin> I have a drawing tablet. It's really a glorified bundle of a monitor and a mouse.
[17:59:04] <Bco1981> ah
[17:59:05] <ButterNoodle> fleshlights are fleshlights, onaholes are onaholes.. everything has it own unique purpose
[17:59:14] <isekaijin> ^
[17:59:25] <ButterNoodle> you wouldnt try to fuck a toaster would you?
[17:59:25] <Bco1981> and a drawing tablet isn't a mouse or a monitor
[18:00:00] <ButterNoodle> MootPoot: yea I signed up all my accounts for the beta
[18:00:00] <isekaijin> It really is. On Linux, it really works like a monitor and a mouse (with the pen).
[18:00:32] <Bco1981> and the company brand, provided the linux drivers for this ?
[18:00:35] <isekaijin> But Windows recognizes the drawing tablet and treats it differently.
[18:01:24] <isekaijin> The company itself doesn't make any Linux drivers.
[18:01:40] <Bco1981> hence, it wan't ment to be use that way.
[18:01:45] <isekaijin> rofl
[18:01:45] <Bco1981> wasn't*
[18:02:11] <isekaijin> That doesn't make any sense.

[18:02:32] <Bco1981> if they wanted it to be used like that, they would have made it work in windows, as they provide drivers for i guess.
[18:02:56] <isekaijin> I never installed the Windows drivers for this thing.
[18:03:05] <Bco1981> maybe you should try that.
[18:03:23] <isekaijin> On Linux it works out of the box, rofl.
[18:03:28] <isekaijin> But anyhow, let's see if that works.

[18:05:25] <MootPoot> then if you want anything fancy the OEM drivers are there
[18:05:28] <MootPoot> if your OEM cares
[18:06:00] <Bco1981> ofcourse that won't fix that specific "issue". but you say windows treat it differently. maybe the drivers will make it treat it right. like the company actually intended.
[18:06:26] <isekaijin> There really needs to be a way to swap the contents of two displays.
[18:06:34] <isekaijin> Or swap the mapping of displays to physical monitors.
[18:06:48] <isekaijin> On XMonad, I can do that just fine.
[18:07:09] <MootPoot> usually any additional non basic feature requires a OEM driver ( mouse with a lot of buttons, joysticks, VR controllers, anything )
[18:11:11] <MootPoot> sounds like the linux default drivers is just coincidentally how he likes his stuff setup
[18:11:22] <Bco1981> yeah.

[21:35:10] <isekaijin> What do you mean by “it” in “never had a use for it”?
[21:35:40] <Bco1981> i have never had anything that made sense to me, to need virtual desktops
[21:35:51] <Bco1981> just alt+tab bewteen apps
[21:35:56] <Bco1981> between*
[21:36:07] <isekaijin> Ah, virtual desktops are simply so much cleaner.
[21:36:15] <isekaijin> Everything goes in its proper place.
[21:37:09] <Bco1981> the use i found for it was. i could have a maximized remote desktop on two virtual desktops, and a terminal running btop.
[21:37:55] <Bco1981> but sadly, i had no sound on this install
[21:38:13] <Bco1981> was otherwise the best experience i had ever had with linux.
[21:38:34] <Bco1981> as a desktop
[21:38:56] <Bco1981> servers... linux > windows
[21:39:21] <isekaijin> XMonad by default gives you 9 virtual desktops. So I always use the following program placement: (1) Emacs, (2) Emacs, (3) Firefox, (4) Firefox, (5) three terminals, (6) Discord, (7) Slack, (8) Transmission, (9) VirtualBox.
[21:39:41] <isekaijin> (Sorry for counting from 1, but this stupid program counts the virtual desktops from 1.)
[21:40:21] <isekaijin> If I want to use Firefox for work, I don't need to think, I just press Win+3.
[21:40:29] <isekaijin> If I want to use Firefox for entertainment, I don't need to think, I just press Win+4.
[21:40:31] <isekaijin> And so on.

[21:41:21] <boogiepop> how many programs you got open bro damn
[21:41:50] <Bco1981> but since you are mainly a linux user, what app is good for image browsing... fast and light weight.
[21:42:03] <isekaijin> I use Emacs for image browsing, of course.
[21:42:23] <isekaijin> But then, I have my directory structure mostly memorized.
[21:42:28] <Bco1981> isn't emacs just a kind of terminal ?
[21:42:31] <isekaijin> No.
[21:42:55] <Poeticode> hmm mine are usually 1) social apps 2) firefox 3) IDE 4) misc/temp programs

[21:53:28] <isekaijin> Oh, right. One thing that I noticed in the new Windows UI is that it never asks you to explicitly save your configuration changes.
[21:54:01] <isekaijin> It automatically saves any changes you make. If you were merely trying something out, then tough luck, you have to manually undo it (if you know how to).
[21:55:06] <isekaijin> Now, I wouldn't mind this too much, if the configuration were stored in human-readable text files that anyone can easily edit (possibly programmatically!), backup, etc.
[21:55:38] <isekaijin> But, given the way Windows is, it's unfriendly on its part not to require options to be explicitly saved.
