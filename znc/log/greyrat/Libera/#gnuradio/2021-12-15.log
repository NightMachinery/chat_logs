[14:35:33] <Notou[m]> <rodrirq[m]> "Hello, I am working with jesusp...." <- You most probably will need to write a block (an embedded python block should suffice) to detect the preamble tags output by the _correlate access code_ block, and use the content of the packet to figure out how many bits are in it. 
[14:35:33] <Notou[m]> That way you can isolate the frame bits from noise bits and, either record the bit sequence directly to file from that block, or stream the bit sequence to a _tagged file sink_ block, with "burst" tags at start and end of frame to trigger recording into a new file.
