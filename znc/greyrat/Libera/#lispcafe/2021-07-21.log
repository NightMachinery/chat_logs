[15:07:14] <selwyn> anki is good for learning potentially large amounts of vocabulary

[15:07:47] <shka> hayley: teddy?
[15:07:48] <selwyn> because it is a stealth plane
[15:07:55] <shka> i know about this library
[15:08:04] <hayley> One sec...
[15:08:14] <shka> i started vellum before it existed, but my development process was not exactly... efficient
[15:08:20] <hayley> Sawzall https://docs.racket-lang.org/sawzall/index.html
[15:08:21] -ixelp- Sawzall: A grammar for chopping up data
[15:08:39] <shka> ooh, no that's new for me
[15:08:48] <shka> no wonder, since it is racket
[15:08:54] <hayley> They use a sorted merge join whereas my intuition (and AIUI what vellum does?) is to use a hash join, given that the data set is already in memory, so cooking up a hash table isn't so bad.
[15:09:07] <hayley> Do you know if either is faster?
[15:09:36] <shka> i use hash-join in vellum, merge join is usually faster though 
[15:09:44] <shka> if your data is ordered at least
[15:10:11] <hayley> They think they're wasting time sorting, because the data isn't ordered to start with.
[15:11:09] <shka> hm, i think that asymptotically sorting will loose, but in wonder at which N
[15:11:39] <shka> anyway, the problem with hash-join is that there is no memory locality 
[15:12:31] <shka> i personally don't care about the performance of join all that much because i made vellum with more of interactive use cases in mind
[15:12:50] <shka> and if join takes 1 second or 1 ms does not make a practical difference in such case
[15:13:08] <hayley> https://crate.io/a/joins-faster-part-one/ has some (literally two rows) numbers under "Making a decision".
[15:13:09] -ixelp- How we made joins 23 thousand times faster: part one | Lab notes
[15:14:26] <hayley> Though AIUI if one is smaller and one is larger, they should just flip the left and right tables around to get the better performance? As such I'd sorta expect the faster of each in a real test.
[15:14:27] <shka> sawzall looks kinda nice honestly 
[15:15:02] <shka> it is closer to being lisp version of dplyr then vellum
[15:15:24] <shka> mostly because vellum reaches outside for grouping and aggregation
[15:15:29] <hayley> As for cache locality, I'd need to bug them to use vectors - at least the join code used lists.
[15:16:12] <shka> which makes sense because this way i can have aggregation and grouping without having data frames to begin with
[15:16:57] <hayley> But would we have unsorted data, I don't see anything having good locality.
[15:17:23] <shka> hayley: yeah
[15:17:48] * shka should also consider adding some higher level grammar to vellum
[15:17:55] <shka> like where
[15:18:24] <shka> right now it is all about using transform which is a Swiss knife of a function
[15:18:54] <shka> can do filtering, transform row values, do that in place or create new frame
[15:19:20] <shka> which is great, but at some points stops being easy to read
[15:20:21] <selwyn> sounds a bit like petalisp
[15:20:27] <shka> hayley: kudos to the author of the lib, it looks like a really good effort!
[15:20:38] <shka> and i like racket as well
[15:20:51] <hayley> Petalisp came up when I tried to think of optimization things.
[15:21:32] <hayley> But I am not very bright and I said that the whole thing could be lazily evaluated, which would allow doing "whole program" analysis on the query. But Petalisp only has that COMPUTE function because it spits out CL arrays.
[15:21:45] <shka> selwyn: i guess all DSLs have a common point
[15:22:06] <hayley> Since data frames are opaque objects, you could rather only force when someone uses a reader function, and there would be no explicit COMPUTE.
[15:22:14] <selwyn> petalisp has this minimal design where everything is built out of three basic operations iirc
[15:22:21] <shka> and systems like those, will all have verbs, adjectives and so one 
[15:22:43] <shka> yeah, alpha, beta... and i don't remember :P
[15:22:55] <hayley> It was map-reduce-transform, but I accidentally showed reduce was a special case of map and transform, so now it is map-transform.
[15:24:03] <shka> that's what you want anyway
[15:24:17] <shka> you want the minimal set of fundamental operations
[15:28:53] <hayley> So the series in this data-frame library is also a hash table. The key seems to be the column name, then the value is a structure which has a vector of the elements.
[15:29:31] <shka> a little bit wasteful but ok
[15:30:20] <hayley> That would make grabbing rows for our join a bit harder than I'd prefer.
[15:32:14] <hayley> But the author of Sawzall didn't make that data-frame library. So I can't ask them to add slots to the data-frame structure, or make it some abstract class where an actual table is a mere subclass.
[15:34:17] <shka> well, you can work on vellum instead :-)
[15:35:11] <shka> and yeah, you can subclass standard-class
[15:35:44] <shka> *standard-table
[15:35:47] * hayley is afraid to ask them to use CL, since she got in a fight when a friend of theirs shit talked it for no reason.
[15:36:16] <shka> uh, i don't know, CL is a wonderful language
[15:36:23] <shka> so is racket
[15:36:30] <shka> but i personally prefer cl
[15:36:53] * hayley thinks "immutable top level" and decides to stop thinking about Racket.
[15:37:26] <selwyn> i like racket for the js interop that we saw in the latest els
[15:39:17] <hayley> I don't really want to debug Racket or JS, so a Racket-JS FFI is scary :)
[15:39:53] <selwyn> does it have a true ffi? i can´t remember
[15:40:03] <SAL9000> time for a Racket WASM backend instead? :-)
[15:40:43] <hayley> I also don't really want to debug any WASM targets (:
[15:41:27] <selwyn> once i tried app development using clojurescript -> javascript -> react native -> android/ios
[15:41:27] <SAL9000> >debug >WASM
[15:41:30] <SAL9000> ahahaha
[15:41:37] <SAL9000> there is no debug, there is only console.log /s
[15:41:37] <selwyn> most unstable stack ever
[15:42:03] <hayley> shka: Well, it was something about CL not learning anything from Standard ML or something, which a. doesn't make sense because CL started in 1981 and SML was published in...1983? and b. ML "only" had pattern matching, types, mutable cells, and crap to work with types.
[15:42:16] <SAL9000> selwyn: have you tried PWA?
[15:42:40] <hayley> When I mentioned it, I was called a whole bunch of pleasant names. And then I said "sure, whatever" and they kept going saying I wasn't allowed to feel bad or something like that.
[15:42:42] <selwyn> sal9000: it looks interesting but i am not currently in the market for such a thing
[15:43:22] <SAL9000> aha. to be clear, I'm not "recommending" it or anything like that -- haven't touched anything web other than WASM in years.
[15:43:28] <selwyn> oh, no firefox support
[15:43:35] <selwyn> right
[15:43:51] <SAL9000> (I am, however, disappointed in a particular React Native app, the web version of which isn't responsive, never mind PWA)
[15:43:55] <hayley> That was the day that I really started to hate people FWIW.
[15:44:48] <SAL9000> reminds me of the "unidirectional filter" essay
[15:45:18] <SAL9000> i.e. "we all have a filter that applies politeness... it only works one way. 'most' people have it oriented outwards."
[15:47:17] <hayley> Someone told me that indeed I seem pretty grumpy when I have to put up with people I don't know, and that's probably why.
[15:47:43] <SAL9000> hayley: I think this is the essay in question https://www.mit.edu/~jcb/tact.html
[15:47:43] -ixelp- Tact Filters
[15:48:48] <hayley> Who's the nerd in this situation?
[15:49:22] <shka> and racket takes anything from sml?
[15:50:19] <hayley> Pattern matching? I forgot who it was that I ended up throwing metaphorical hands with, but no one mentioned Racket.
[15:50:37] <shka> you can do pattern matching in cl as a library
[15:50:54] <shka> though, i guess it would be interesting to see pattern matching lambda lists or something
[15:50:57] <hayley> I'll probably cry if I look through my logs, so I won't do that.
[15:51:13] <shka> which you can also do as library, because macros
[15:51:26] <SAL9000> hayley: your explanation of the situation -- particularly "[you're not] allowed to feel bad" etc. -- reminded me of a certain kind of 'chronically offended' person, who presumably has their filter oriented outwards.
[15:51:46] <hayley> Trivia has...some wrappers over DEFUN and LAMBDA but they look like (trivia:defun-match blah (x) (1 ...) ((cons a b) ...)) IIRC
[15:52:31] <hayley> https://github.com/telekons/one-more-re-nightmare/blob/master/Code/nullable.lisp
[15:52:32] -ixelp- one-more-re-nightmare/nullable.lisp at master · telekons/one-more-re-nightmare · GitHub
[15:53:17] <shka> yeah, so why would you need that in the language if you can add this as a library?
[15:53:22] <hayley> The difference AFAICT is that the lambda list doesn't destructure, because CL evidently wants a normal lambda list, and to be fair so would SLIME and whatever else displays lambda lists.
[15:53:59] <hayley> Do I look like I know what was going on in their heads? Can we drop this?
[15:54:11] <shka> well, normal lambda list in cl is already rather complex beast
[15:54:31] <shka> i think that clojure has the best lambda lists in the lispland
[15:54:50] <shka> but that is not important anyway
[15:55:16] <shka> macros do de-structuring of lambda lists
[15:55:22] <hayley> Oh, and Trivia lets you define your own patterns, so you can have patterns while keeping isolation and things.
[15:55:59] <hayley> There was one article I read about why one should use the (pretty crappy for this kind of thing) type system of some language to make it not so bad to expose slots to client modules, and one argument was to make pattern matching work.
[15:56:47] <hayley> That pattern matcher IMHO is a very anti-modular thing. I think Gilad Bracha had something to say about this? He also made fun of HM types in the same presentation.
[15:57:43] <shka> well, i call it quits on this topic 
[15:58:12] <SAL9000> hayley: No problem, sorry about bothering you; it sounded like you wanted to follow up on my mention of the essay.
[15:58:57] <hayley> SAL9000: All good. I rather meant that I didn't feel like trying to figure out that asshole's head with shka.
[15:59:07] <SAL9000> Ah. :)
[15:59:21] <selwyn> shka: what language would you like to learn
[15:59:29] <shka> selwyn: russian
[15:59:48] <shka> because russian memes are superior
[15:59:48] <hayley> (With no offense intended to shka either. I don't usually say I'm uncomfortable with things until far too late.)
[16:00:27] <hayley> Did you capture audio in the CS:GO data sets?
[16:00:31] <SAL9000> oh boy
[16:00:39] <selwyn> imo duolingo is excellent for smaller languages, while for bigger languages, there are many other learning resources that it has to compete with
[16:00:56] <shka> selwyn: ok, got it
[16:01:05] <SAL9000> if the memetic images of CS:GO players is in any way accurate, learning Russian from CS:GO audio is... well.
[16:01:11] <SAL9000> s/is in/are in/
[16:01:39] <shka> russian grammar is similar but simpler to Polish, so the alphabet and vocabulary is the main problem for me 
[16:01:50] <selwyn> i can´t think of any downside to duolingo really, apart from a possible ´impedance mismatch´ that you would have to learn russian using an english language app
[16:02:14] <selwyn> but i cannot comment on this, apart from noting that people seem to manage

[16:02:48] <selwyn> hm, duolingo does not typically teach large amounts of vocabulary
[16:03:11] <shka> i can give it a try
[16:03:39] <selwyn> after duolingo you might look into anki flashcards as i say
[16:04:08] <shka> yeah
[16:06:02] <selwyn> polish grammar is harder than russian? damn
[16:06:21] <shka> well, Russian has no separate grammar for questions
[16:06:23] <shka> for instance
[16:07:56] <hayley> Right I think https://www.infoq.com/presentations/functional-pros-cons/ was that talk
[16:07:58] -ixelp- Deconstructing Functional Programming
[16:09:52] <selwyn> i had the idea of learning russian to understand a couple of untranslated papers
[16:10:08] <selwyn> but the effort to reward ratio would be very high
[16:10:33] <shka> well, it is very different language structure compared to english

[16:18:13] <hayley> I got the grade review back. And they changed nothing.
[16:18:13] <hayley> Not even my claim that if they say "the Maven build system", I expect to be able to use just that.

[16:21:41] <hayley> And another beautiful one: "We used the NumberFormat class to format every quantity presented, so there is no argument that we did not format some quantity." "You don't need the NumberFormat class to format numbers." Cool, and how does it relate to the original argument?
[16:23:49] <hayley> "Ms. Patton was explicitly instructed by course staff to ensure all their Java programs in Programming Studio 1, including their project, could be executed using the supported course VS Code setup. In particular, the course staff explicitly noted this is required to ensure Ms. Patton could effectively work with their project group partner." Yeah, and that setup was poorly represented. You said "VS Code uses Maven", so that's what I did. How is
[16:23:49] <hayley> it my fault that it doesn't work?
[16:25:12] <SAL9000> "lol you should have tested using the university's setup on their computers" seems to be the stance
[16:27:39] <hayley> I mean, they said they use Maven over and over, how was I not supposed to think that VS Code used Maven (and not some crappy clone) and so I'd have no problem with just that?
[16:29:47] <shka> as for the russian CS players
[16:30:03] <shka> there is no money to be made on those kids

[16:36:08] <selwyn> by some margin
[16:36:41] <shka> i also hate hindley-milner type system
[16:38:15] <SAL9000> hayley: I TA'd a Scheme course a few years back. I was told to not "waste time" running any students' code, never mind running it with anything other than the "approved" toolset. Knowing how much that kind of shite pissed me off as a student, I spent like double the "approved" (i.e. paid for) time marking because I would run peoples' code and if it didn't work with Racket I'd try Chicken Scheme
[16:38:17] <SAL9000> too, not to mention actually giving feedback beyond right/wrong (which was also "not expected").

[16:40:58] <hayley> SAL9000: Nice. But it would be like saying, I dunno, that your Racket setup included some SRFI (again I dunno how) but as it happens, it was just some subset and this was never communicated unless you RTFM for Racket and it's somewhere in the fine print there.
[16:41:22] <SAL9000> Well, it was a *Scheme* course, not a *Racket* course.
[16:41:29] <SAL9000> i.e. we were using Racket in "R5RS" mode
[16:41:44] <SAL9000> but Racket R5RS has only peripheral correspondence to, y'know, actual R5RS
[16:41:54] <hayley> Right. But this is a nonsensical example anyway.
[16:42:09] <SAL9000> My point was more "TAs told to Not Bother and most probably won't" :(
[16:42:21] <SAL9000> only paid for "simple marking" time -- like, 2-3 minutes per student

[16:47:12] <hayley> Like I had stripped down the landing page (it is a web application) in a way that I believed eliminated enough user errors and didn't frighten the new user with too many buttons. This is a tradeoff, and I mentioned it in the presentation. But a claim was that the page was too underpopulated.

[16:51:31] <hayley> If I put navigation shortcuts on the front page, we'd need more dropdown boxes to only allow valid input, and then it begins to look pretty nasty and I lose focus looking at the page. This is a feature.

[18:10:26] <gilberth> Somehow Duolingo is not for me. I miss a kinda formal introduction to grammar, I could just learn.
[18:11:10] <gilberth> Or rather how declination and conjugation works. Grammar itself is all the same.
[18:12:17] <gilberth> If that is how that it is called in English.
[18:14:28] <hayley> Hi gilberth 
[18:14:47] <gilberth> Hello hayley!
[18:15:16] <Gnuxie> hi gilberth
[18:17:18] <gilberth> And my weak spot is pronunciation, I guess for that I would need a real teacher. And I fear memorizing it the wrong way as this happened to me for English.

[18:20:13] <hayley> shka: No, it was certainly maximal effort.
[18:20:18] <shka> gilberth: right
[18:20:23] <shka> well, that sucks
[18:20:36] <hayley> Semester 2 of last year was minimal, and I did well enough to get an invitation for an academic society that I threw out.
[18:21:00] <gilberth> Well, hayley, would make that score it to your final score?
[18:21:35] <hayley> I don't know, I just thought I have to pass everything.
[18:21:46] <gilberth> hmm
[18:22:01] <hayley> But it does appear on my academic transcript.
[18:22:12] <gilberth> Anyhow, you're done with it? Any further things to do while there are no lectures?
[18:22:56] <hayley> I got an email about a survey run by the government. Wonder what praise I can fit into that.
[18:23:18] <gilberth> What do they want to know?
[18:24:52] <hayley> A "student experience" survey, so just that.
[18:25:43] <gilberth> "Student experience" What kind of? Partying?
[18:26:06] <hayley> Probably what you think of university in general.
[18:26:23] <gilberth> Which university?
[18:26:45] <hayley> After what I said about it, you think I'd say which?
[18:27:12] <gilberth> Heh. Do you indent to be honest with that survey?
[18:27:23] <hayley> Very much so.
[18:27:41] <gilberth> Fine. Will there be your name on it?
[18:27:50] <hayley> Nope.
[18:27:56] <gilberth> Good. :)
[18:29:41] <hayley> Last year I wrote a review of the Java class which I got in trouble for.
[18:30:09] <hayley> That had my name on it. My points were there was no OOP (c.f. <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKg1hTOQXoY>) and they used crappy algorithms and data structures (c.f. the Wirth book).

[18:32:50] <hayley> And for what I didn't really learn, I admit I am a tiny bit insulted to have to go through the class I didn't get a fair grade for. One thing was that the program manager didn't buy that I learnt SQL in high school.
[18:33:19] <hayley> You have my word that everything the university taught was covered in my high school. Which was a mediocre large-ish public school FWIW.
[18:36:45] <hayley> The other part was "user centric design", which was just another way of capturing user requirements and desires, but you make up names and backstories for your users. 
[18:39:09] <hayley> Okay, not really, but the only complaint there was "YOU DIDN'T REFERENCE YOUR PERSONAS!!1!!1one"

[20:48:14] <shka> usb, portable 
[20:48:40] <SAL9000> if it only has one usb plug = it is bus powered, it may not work (at all, or brownout intermittently) with the pi
[20:48:57] <shka> it has two usb plugs i think
[20:49:20] <SAL9000> not sure then. still safer to plug the "power" plug into a separate usb power adaptor.
[20:49:32] <SAL9000> which gen of pi? afaik Pi4 is better about powering stuff over usb.
[20:54:12] <shka> it is pi4
[20:54:24] <shka> pi4b to be specific
[21:00:20] <SAL9000> then it's more likely to work :)
[21:00:43] <SAL9000> of course, you might still have issues with docker containers not being ported to the Pi's ARM.
