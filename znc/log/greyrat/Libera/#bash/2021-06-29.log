[00:06:25] <jmcantrell> is there a way to pass $@ on to `bash -c "command ..."`?
[00:06:39] <geirha> bash -c 'command "$@"' _ "$@"
[00:07:30] <jmcantrell> geirha: what's the _ "$@" part?
[00:07:37] <greycat> !sh-c
[00:07:37] <greybot> sh -c 'commands' argv0 a1 a2 a3 ## The argv0 placeholder can be any string. Don't expand variables like sh -c "foo $bar"; that's a code injection. Use sh -c 'foo "$1"' x "$bar"; see https://mywiki.wooledge.org/CodeInjection
[00:07:44] <greycat> _ is the placeholder
[00:08:07] <jmcantrell> interesting. thanks
[00:08:14] <geirha> $0 is normally set to the name of the script file, but when you provide the script via argument, it instead expects the next argument to be the name of the script, and I just set it to "_" there, as it doesn't really matter what the name is

[00:19:52] <jmcantrell> this shows a PATH already set: env -i sh -c set
[00:20:32] <geirha> bash has a hardcoded PATH it uses if there's no PATH in env

[16:11:12] <twkm> bit masking.  yes dividing by 2 once you convert to a pure number.
[16:12:05] <twkm> generally speaking it isn't possible to find a prefix length without the netmask, or if it is on an interface ask system tools to tell you how it is configured.

[17:17:41] <koollman> 1011 and 1001 is 1001 . take each bit, position by position, apply 'AND' logic table, you get the result for the current bit position
[17:18:22] <koollman> which makes it nice to make a mask. anything with value 0 in the mask will be 'unset' by applying it. so, ip address AND mask -> network address

[20:29:30] <FreeBDSM> AFAIU this doesn't really fit my case well: I have script-initiator and script-worker. There are 4 initiators (each calls script-worker with necessary args); AFAIU to use associative arrays I'd need to move the declaration of those vars away from script-worker to script-initator, and since I have multiple of them - that's a WET approach, I want DRY.

[21:16:12] <Filystyn> but maybe some better  ideas
[21:17:16] <kurahaupo_> clawh: I'm not a fan of the "read /dev/random and throw stuff away", because it takes indeterminate time, and could potentially mess up the entropy pool estimator. If you want X bit of entropy, read X bits of entropy, and then map that into whatever representation you plan to use. Base64-encode is a good approximation if you basically what alphanumeric
[21:17:54] <kurahaupo_> Filystyn: $'\r'

[21:18:05] <Filystyn> chekcing this

[22:51:32] <pandoxer> I just want to deploy two changes, rather than copying over an entirely different .conf file

[22:56:46] <omegatron> you could also make a list of conf files with all the changes you deem possible (if not too many) and want to switch between and then just rename those files, so that only the file with the requested configuration is at /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf

[22:59:22] <omegatron> pandoxer: many solutions .. choose your own "best way" ..
[22:59:28] <twkm> some systems wouldn't read a home directory for a root daemon's configuration.
[23:00:17] <pandoxer> yeah I think i'll go with sed
[23:00:31] <twkm> even if not root it might deny a not-the-same-uid-owner file.
[23:01:15] <omegatron> but please think about making a backup of the conf file before any modification, in case something goes wrong and you have to restore any pervious state

[23:14:55] <kurahaupo> omegatron: "pervious" = readily damaged, corrupted, or penetrated; opposite of "impervious". Which seems quite apt when users are writing scripts to modify system configuration files
