[00:53:17] <thumbs> mysql -e "CREATE DATABASE foo" yes
[00:55:09] <thumbs> so what is the question?

[15:13:33] <lembron> hi, is there any fancy inbuild trick to "give me holes in a list of ids" or such? - so, given id=1,2,5,6,7,9,11 - "ask it to check 1-12", get an answer alla "3/4(2), 8(1), 10(1), 12(1)" or anything similar...
[15:14:21] <lembron> seems one could spook around with joining from a faketable or such to "expand the list" - but i cant seem to find anything to like "group" the null-buckets
[15:15:42] <lembron> other idea would be to "manually make buckets, and see where count doesnt match and investigate further ((check 1-10=10 lines, 11-20=just 5 lines))" - but that doesnt scale all that well...
[15:16:10] <Xgc> lembron: Yes.  It's pretty easy. You can use an outer join or just simple window functions LEAD/LAG to find edges or holes.

[22:18:52] <litheum> leeuw1976: sounds like a question for ##php? why do you think this has something to do with #mysql?
[22:20:13] <doug16k> leeuw1976, can you run `mysql` on the command line and get in?
[22:20:27] <doug16k> if that works, it probably isn't mysql

[22:22:19] <doug16k> there are a few different ways to execute php - some with or without async - perhaps you don't have the right kind installed
[22:22:56] <doug16k> preforking kind and thread worker kind, etc

[22:23:17] <litheum> doug16k: i trust you've read https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-locks-set.html in detail?
[22:24:39] <doug16k> that's great, thanks
[22:42:03] <doug16k> I don't think that says what happens if you make it acquire an update lock on an index record that was already locked for share in this session
[22:43:08] <doug16k> almost every time you use an RWlock, you need to upgrade sometimes, and if you can't you have to make it an infinite start-all-over acquire algorithm
[22:45:17] <doug16k> where you might shared acquire, and see that a huge work item needs to run to update it, and we need to enforce that only one client does that high-work update, so it upgrades to update, and everyone else waits for share, and they all get it at once at the end of update and release lock
[22:45:40] <doug16k> that is textbook forupdate/forshare right?

[22:49:52] <doug16k> it doesn't say whether a waiting exclusive lock will prevent shared acquires, or it lets shared acquires keep happening indefinitely, locking out exclusive for unbounded time
