[11:03:04] <FromGitter> <yejianfengblue> try debug-on-entry, the function lsp--persist is not called. Instead it's lsp--text-document-did-open what calls save-buffer

[17:46:13] <FromGitter> <hariseldon78> Hello guys. I'm trying to use the server-client approach with spacemacs. I run emacs as daemon with systemd (which just runs emacs --fg-daemon) with my user (systemctl --user start emacs). The problem i have is that when I run emacsclient it is using a different font than the one i configured in the spacemacs configuration. I'm sure that it is loading the config because if i eval (print 
[17:46:13] <FromGitter> ... dotspacemacs-default-font) than it outputs the correct one
[17:48:02] <FromGitter> <hariseldon78> i'm running emacsclient with options: -c -d $DISPLAY
[17:59:29] <FromGitter> <hariseldon78> i see there is already an issue, (closed without reason :-( ) https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/issues/10894
[18:00:12] <FromGitter> <hariseldon78> anyone has solved the problem without the hack of repeating the font configuration?
[18:39:13] <FromGitter> <milochadam> thanks, I'll look into it
