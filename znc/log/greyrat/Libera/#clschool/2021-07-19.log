[22:57:35] <nij-> Hi :) I just finished re-reading this tutorial on generic functions: https://gigamonkeys.com/book/object-reorientation-generic-functions.html
[22:57:45] <nij-> and I wonder if I may ask two questions.
[22:58:38] <nij-> 1. In the standard method combination, the methods come in this order: around->before->primary->after.
[22:58:54] <nij-> I wonder what's the difference between around and before, as they could have been both called "before".
[22:59:37] <nij-> 2. Are there simple real-life examples that use all of the different types (around, before, primary, after)?
[22:59:41] <nij-> Thanks :)
[23:01:20] <antoszka> nij-: Are you Peter Seibel? :)
[23:02:39] <nij-> antoszka: No @@ Why?
[23:02:46] <nij-> I'm a cl-noob.
[23:03:04] <antoszka> oh, sorry, I read "I just finished re-adding this tutorial"
[23:03:13] <antoszka> had too much Pernod today, sorry ;)
[23:03:39] <nij-> ;)
[23:04:09] <mfiano> 1) The answer is in the name
[23:04:23] <nij-> 3. Given a form of (gen-fn obj1 obj2 .. objn), is there a function that prints the effective method, without running the effective method?
[23:04:51] <mfiano> That is, around runs code _instead_ of the most applicable method, with the user being able to insert a call to the next method via #'call-next-method
[23:04:55] <nij-> Something like (show-effective-method (gen-fn obj1 obj2 .. objn)) ;; Oh in this case, show-effective-method must be a macro.
[23:05:55] <nij-> mfiano: @@ Sorry.. I don't comprehend.
[23:05:57] <mfiano> find-method, if i understand you
[23:07:05] <mfiano> an around method lets you hook into the before and after of a piece of code. You can use it to establish a dynamic variable binding, for example
[23:07:11] <nij-> Oh cool! find-method is almost what I want. At least I can wrap it to what I want :) Thanks!
[23:07:27] <mfiano> with a before and after, you cannot do that
[23:10:51] <nij-> ;; Hmm I now think find-method isn't what I am looking for.
[23:11:39] <nij-> If I understand correctly, upon calling a generic function, all applicable methods will be sorted by in a deterministic way.
[23:12:08] <nij-> This results in a list (ordered!) of methods. These methods will be arranged into an effective method.
[23:12:27] <nij-> Can I easily see what that list of applicable methods is?
[23:12:51] <nij-> That must tremendously help make a smooth developing experience!

[23:17:42] <mfiano> When standard method combination is used with qualified methods, section 7.6.6.2 of the HyperSpec describes how an implementation produces an effective method.
[23:17:54] <mfiano> If you want to interrogate how CLOS works, you use the MOP
