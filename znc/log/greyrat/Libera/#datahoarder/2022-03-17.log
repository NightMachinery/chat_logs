[00:39:50] <Codaraxis_> evilgohan2, but it's not just about copying. I could write my own script that has a list of paths to what I want "checked out" and have rsync then check and sync on a regular schedule, but I was hoping for something a bit nicer. Ideally, I'd have an interface that a) lets me select folders and/or files; b) lets me filter the upstream content by the child-most element selection selected; and c) intelligently, determine when to sync using some 
[00:39:50] <Codaraxis_> sort of upstream sync.
[00:39:53] <Codaraxis_> I'd like it to be similar to the "make available offline" feature so many cloud-based services have.

[19:08:30] <Czernobog> Hello, I need help with DNS. I have a domain which I use for selfhosting purpose and it's behind ZeroTier. I want to use the same domain to publish a website as well. Is this possible to do?
[19:08:54] <Czernobog> publish a website to the world* if I may
[19:10:07] <superkuh> I don't know what zerotier is, but I imagine you just go add an A record in the DNS entries that points to the IPv4 of your server.
[19:10:17] <superkuh> (or AAAA if ipv6)
[19:10:53] <Czernobog> superkuh, It's a VPN. I use it to tunnel through cgnat.
[19:11:05] <rawktucc> that's a totally separate issue then
[19:11:15] <rawktucc> you need to look up port forwarding for ZeroTier, or whatever process is involved there
[19:11:20] <superkuh> And you want to host from the computer that's behind the VPN?
[19:11:24] <rawktucc> but for DNS specifically, just add an appropriate A record
[19:12:13] <superkuh> I'd ditch the VPN (and tunnel what applications need it individually) or figure out a way to except the port/service.
[19:12:30] <vuori> Do you mean that your domain's name server is on the Zerotier network? Or does it have normal servers but you want to host a public server on your Zerotier network?
[19:12:38] <vuori> normal name servers
[19:12:59] <rawktucc> superkuh, they can't host if they're not on the zerotier vpn, because they're behind cgnat
[19:13:20] <superkuh> Oh. Right. Yuck.
[19:13:27] <rawktucc> yes
[19:13:28] <Czernobog> No, I am using cloudflare. I have the A record pointing to the ZeroTier IP and couple of CNAME
[19:13:54] <superkuh> ZeroTier IP? You get a static one?
[19:14:13] <Czernobog> superkuh, yeah, you can assign any ip
[19:14:28] <vuori> I haven't used ZeroTier for a couple of years, but back then the easiest method was to have a VPS or something, join that to the ZeroTier network and forward port from the VPS public IP to the ZT internal IP
[19:14:30] <Czernobog> I want to publish the website using git hugo and cloudflare but since 
[19:15:17] <Czernobog> but since I already have A record pointing to the ZT IP I was wondering if there's a way
[19:15:40] *** Joins: labrador (~labrador@user/labrador)
[19:16:01] <Czernobog> vuori, I can't afford a VPS for now
[19:16:16] <vuori> Unless things have changed ZT IPs aren't accessible to outsiders directly, you'll need to somehow forward stuff from a public address to the inside
[19:16:32] <rawktucc> i think you could just use cloudflare workers in this case
[19:16:36] <rawktucc> if your site is on github already
[19:16:38] <rawktucc> or use github sites

[19:16:47] <unfinity> labrador you shot a duck in 5.148 seconds! You have killed 1 duck in #datahoarder.
[19:16:48] <rawktucc> you're kinda screwed a bit because of the crappy cgnat unfortunately
[19:17:59] <Czernobog> rawktucc, I guess so. But even if I wasn't I would still be using VPN
[19:19:11] <superkuh> I don't suppose there's any chance of getting an ISP instead of a web service provider?
[19:20:41] <vuori> You might be able to use Cloudflare Tunnel, looks like the free plan includes it
[19:21:03] <superkuh> Yeah. Cloudflare is terrible but given your situation it's not any worse.

[19:43:53] <vuori> ok, not really helpful then, you'll need a public IP somehow

[19:46:04] <ThePendulum> https://github.com/RIAEvangelist/node-ipc/issues/308
[19:46:05] <ThePendulum> hah
[19:46:06] <ThePendulum> yeah
[19:46:12] <ThePendulum> well fucking done, twats
[19:47:49] <warmwaffles> I saw that
[19:47:55] <warmwaffles> such a shit show
[19:48:13] <warmwaffles> also, y u no have backups
[19:53:53] <ThePendulum> yeah if it's true that's definitely also a major fuck-up on their part,
[19:54:02] <warmwaffles> massive
[19:54:40] <joepie91> I have my questions about the truthfulness of that issue (there are some odd errors in there that I would not expect from a native English speaker) but honestly I'm not sure it matters much, it's a good illustration of what kind of consequences this can have
[19:56:23] <warmwaffles> The js ecosystem with the dependency trees that I've seen, it's close to impossible to monitor all of them for any breaking changes like that.
[19:56:57] <labrador> Eh its a bluff anyway
[19:57:27] <labrador> No lawyer can do anything about that...also what did they do anyway? Nuke the file system or something?
[19:57:30] <ThePendulum> would it even emerge as a breaking change in tests?
[19:57:40] <warmwaffles> Oh, I'm not really talking about the dumb ass NGO group
[19:57:54] <warmwaffles> just the dependency situation where a sabatoge can happen
[19:58:48] <joepie91> warmwaffles: it's actually quite possible to monitor changes like this *if* you restrict yourself to single-responsibility dependencies, but in practice *most* people don't do that because they carry over assumptions from other languages and go for the do-it-all packages, which then pull in massive unauditable dependency trees :/
[19:58:54] <joepie91> this is a perpetual frustration in JS-land
[19:59:08] <warmwaffles> Yea, for any js shit, I pin versions
[19:59:12] <joepie91> people shooting themselves in the foot by insistently following assumptions and preconceived notions
[19:59:22] <warmwaffles> also pin for any other language projects as well
[19:59:23] <joepie91> instead of actually, like, learning how shit works and whyu
[19:59:25] <joepie91> why*
[19:59:33] <joepie91> warmwaffles: lockfiles do that by default
[19:59:50] <joepie91> which is why it's pissing me off that a lot of people are trying to use this incident as an excuse to bash on npm
[20:00:04] <joepie91> like, ~everything is vulnerable to this, and half of the other package managers don't even have a reasonable lockfile mechanism
[20:00:06] <labrador> Actually I would bash js culture and npm
[20:00:15] <joepie91> labrador: yeah or just fucking don't
[20:00:31] <rawktucc> i truly believe tumblr is on a path towards site closure within the next 3-5 years
[20:00:34] <rawktucc> and it's one of the most unique, deranged, exciting and hilarious "social" media sites on the internet
[20:00:40] <labrador> joepie91, why would I use a language whose projects take in more than 1k deps of which more are rando scripts?
[20:00:45] <joepie91> I don't need to hear yet another shitty take from someone who doesn't understand how any of it works
[20:00:49] <labrador> Why would I not denigrate it

[20:03:26] <labrador> Nice modding skills
[20:03:28] <skye0> i think it seems to be a safer place to not be white on tumblr than anywhere else
[20:03:38] <skye0> tumblr also seems to bring next to nothing new or interesting to the table.
[20:03:38] <ThePendulum> white men say, only fooools rush in
[20:03:41] <rawktucc> yes, I agree with that. it definitely is.Tumblr is kinda psuedo-anonymous
[20:03:43] <rawktucc> pretty much
[20:03:47] <rawktucc> it depends on what content you follow, blogs I mean
[20:03:52] <rawktucc> i really love how niche the memes can get
[20:04:05] <rawktucc> the site itself shares one brain cell in a sense, we all latch on to the newest memes and just run with them
[20:04:11] <skye0> tiktok keeps users hooked through their AI thing, instagram is trying to copy tiktok and at least has the meta's help and the help of some influencers keeping instagram alive
[20:04:14] <joepie91> labrador: this is your final warning: if you believe that your opinion of a language is a justification to bash on and "denigrate" it and/or people using it, then your shitty attitude is not welcome here.
[20:04:14] <rawktucc> like the Slug Gay Kiss Reaction meme the past week or so
[20:04:25] <skye0> tumblr is on life support through wordpress these days
[20:04:32] <rawktucc> skye0, that's exactly what tumblr users like myself hate :) I hate AIs, I hate algorithms, and suggestions, and other bullshit
[20:04:45] <skye0> twitter remains used because it's just big and it's basically reddit for those who prefer their news in non-text format
[20:04:46] <joepie91> I don't care how bad you think the language is. it's not a reason to harass others about it.
[20:04:48] <rawktucc> skye0, they just introduced a paid ad-free feature, which is good for funding, aI understand it
[20:04:59] <rawktucc> also they introduced a merch store
[20:05:04] <rawktucc> which im tempted to get a patch
[20:05:14] <skye0> rawktucc i think tumblr is pretty light with AIs and algorithms. in fact, it tries very hard to keep users focused on the very content they want
[20:05:15] <rawktucc> but if i buy it, they'll link my tumblr to my home address I Bet hahahah... and fuck that
[20:05:21] <rawktucc> exactly why people love it

[20:06:27] <skye0> but yeah, a lot of people are either turned off by tumblr's own brand of toxicity (fandom and inter-queer discourse) or just prefer the pretty (and often, white) influencers on sites like instagram and tiktok. tumblr also seems to value anonymity far more
[20:06:49] <skye0> only thing tumblr and reddit share in common is that anonymity is a bit more valued in those sites than most other places.

[20:09:23] <rawktucc> i dont even understand half of this post tbh
[20:09:26] <skye0> i found this. queer discourse in reddit cries misandry whereas tumblr kind of gets to the point from what i found
[20:09:40] <rawktucc> before I say anything further: is this your blog
[20:09:45] <skye0> no
[20:09:50] <rawktucc> ok phew
[20:09:55] <rawktucc> cause this 15 year old has some wild ideas
[20:09:57] <skye0> "they [men, especially homophobic ones] are also repulsed by the idea that a woman cannot feel attraction to a man. your relations to men are equivalent to your protection; in general as a woman you are safest when you are a man’s wife and a man’s mother."
[20:10:08] <rawktucc> and personally I would just ignore them lol because anyone under 18 should not interact with me or my tumblr blog
[20:10:22] <ThePendulum> a woman cannot feel attraction to a man?
[20:10:31] <skye0> this post is basically saying that gay women are hated in a very particular way because they do not desire men as husbands or boyfriends
[20:10:43] <ThePendulum> oh particular women
[20:10:45] <rawktucc> i think that's a silly idea
[20:11:04] <ThePendulum> idk I guess that would frustrate some
[20:11:14] <xMopx> Lol the js nuts out in full force eh
[20:11:19] <skye0> and how bi women are granted some degree of "protection" for having the ability to like men

[20:11:54] <skye0> rawktucc this was a tasteless international women's day post i think they made

[20:12:12] <rawktucc> yes skye0 it was incredibly tasteless and bad
[20:12:16] <joepie91> there was a second part to that tweet
[20:12:19] <joepie91> but yeah, it was bad
[20:12:19] <rawktucc> good god how could they have not thought that through

[20:12:41] <joepie91> rawktucc: they tried an 'edgy punchline' thing
[20:12:52] <skye0> it's a rich white man's club up there
[20:13:08] <joepie91> with the second tweet going "... if they want to, of course. <random blah blah about how inclusive BK is>"
[20:13:19] <rawktucc> wooooof. they should've put it in the same tweet
[20:13:19] <joepie91> this is... not very compatible with how twitter works
[20:13:21] <rawktucc> even that reply is bad
[20:13:23] <joepie91> yeah, exactly
[20:13:39] <joepie91> it was a bad choice, but I do understand how they ended up at it
[20:14:19] <skye0> "women belong in the kitchen, their hard work helps us at Burger King be able to give you quality dishes" or something along that line

[21:09:50] <skye0> good thing i tend to stay away from JS-related stuff unless absolutely necessary
[21:10:57] <joepie91> rawktucc: this is in no way npm-specific
[21:11:06] <joepie91> basically every package registry is vulnerable to this
[21:11:17] <joepie91> and quite a few language package managers don't even have lockfiles to mitigate this sort of thing
[21:11:25] <joepie91> so if your response to this is "sandboxing JS software" then you're doing it wrong
[21:11:39] <xMopx> pulling down an order of magnitude more packages increases the risk of exposure 
[21:11:43] <joepie91> nope
[21:11:44] <skye0> kinda sad that i'm considering using windows just to use a program that requires CUDA and tensorflow (although i could get the same problem since it's an unmaintained package now)
[21:12:14] <xMopx> of course it does, for the same reason having more dependencies increases risk
[21:12:19] <joepie91> nope
[21:12:27] <joepie91> see also: https://twitter.com/joepie91/status/1065193459349446656
[21:12:28] <xMopx> yep
[21:12:42] <joepie91> you are implicitly assuming that more dependencies == more trusted authors and that is false
[21:13:01] <xMopx> that tweet doesn't look relevant 
[21:13:04] <joepie91> moreso, in this case, just like in a number of previous cases, the problem was with a package of a known and otherwise trusted ecosystem contributor, not some random nobody
[21:13:17] <joepie91> in other words: someone who would probably have been in your dep tree in another language as well
[21:13:30] <xMopx> probably? now that sounds like an assumption 
[21:13:33] <joepie91> xMopx: it addresses this myth + a number of preceding myths
[21:13:47] <xMopx> that tweet just looks like a vague claim 
[21:14:10] <xMopx> is there anything that isn't handwavy on this topic?
[21:14:18] <joepie91> so honestly, it's your choice what your takeaway from this is, what you consider more important: finding an excuse to complain about JS, or actually understanding the failure mode and protecting yourself against future incidents?
[21:14:27] <joepie91> pick one
[21:15:01] <xMopx> that's a no
[21:15:44] <xMopx> pulling in dependencies from more sources obviously increases risk of exposure. You apparently disagree but can't seem to explain why lol
[21:16:15] <joepie91> xMopx: why exactly do you feel you are in a position to dismiss the information and reasoning I've provided for being "too handwavy" when *your own* argument boiled down to "more packages, therefore more authors to compromise" and didn't even consider whether that correlation is actually true in practice?
[21:16:28] <joepie91> (which it is not, as that thread explains)
[21:16:41] <xMopx> i said handwavy because there's a lack of reasoning behind your point
[21:16:48] <xMopx> maybe it exists, but you havent expressed it
[21:17:05] <joepie91> like, this would be a different discussion if you came in with actual credible data, but right now you're basically disagreeing because it doesn't conclusively disprove your gut feeling, which uhhhh
[21:17:13] <joepie91> xMopx: the reasoning is provided in the thread.
[21:17:23] <xMopx> the concept i am positing is so basic that is not necessary
[21:17:36] <xMopx> joepie91: i dont use twitter. Can you link the specific post?
[21:17:37] <joepie91> ah yes, the "common sense" argument, the famous justification for unsupported gut feelings
[21:17:49] <xMopx> because the post you already linked doesn't cover it
[21:18:15] <xMopx> you may not like it but ive explained my case better and with more detail than you have
[21:18:37] <joepie91> xMopx: it's a thread, ie. multiple tweets. this myth is part of what it covers. the specific section that addresses this specific myth is https://twitter.com/joepie91/status/1065193478630576128 but if you haven't read the rest then it's likely that you're going to try and dismiss it on the basis of a wrong assumption.
[21:18:44] <rawktucc> i trust the arch repo developers more than random package dependencies
[21:18:50] <joepie91> xMopx: you've explained literally nothing

[21:19:38] <joepie91> which is just a shared gut feeling.
[21:19:52] <joepie91> seriously, take the hint.
[21:19:56] <xMopx> it's a common belief and a gut feeling that the sky is blue
[21:20:03] <xMopx> but it's foolish to argue against that too
[21:20:05] <rawktucc> my eyeballs are exploding
[21:20:22] <joepie91> you don't have to desperately try and defend a poorly-thought-through belief, you can also just take a step back and re-evaluate based on new information
[21:20:38] <xMopx> what's the new information?
[21:20:44] <joepie91> which in this case has actual security implications
[21:21:31] <xMopx> i think you're acting like your opinion is new information as a matter of posture 
[21:21:37] <xMopx> but it's just a foolish opinion 
[21:21:55] <joepie91> seriously, stop.
[21:22:01] <xMopx> i think you need to stop
[21:22:17] <joepie91> you don't want to argue the actual reasoning, fine. but stop rattling off every fallacy in the book trying to desperately "win" the discussion
[21:22:20] <xMopx> this is the 2nd time youve written an essay about javascript today 
[21:22:39] <xMopx> thou dost protest too much
[21:22:51] *** xMopx was kicked by not-joepie91 (I told you to stop)
[21:22:59] *** Joins: xMopx (~xMopx-lib@192.95.23.134)
[21:23:22] <xMopx> you dont deserve to be an op for kicking those that disagree with you
[21:23:53] <xMopx> such immaturity is not surprising given the discussion 
[21:23:53] <joepie91> xMopx: that kick was for bad-faith arguing, not for 'disagreeing'.
[21:24:04] <joepie91> xMopx: and if you insist on keeping going, it will turn into a ban
[21:25:00] <xMopx> im happy to help prove my point about to
[21:25:02] <xMopx> about you*
[21:27:00] <skye0> again, time to cancel JS i think lel
[21:27:18] <skye0> i'm not following the argument and i don't wish to since i want to take a nap anyway
[21:28:27] <xMopx> agree
[21:28:42] <skye0> why does cuda need visual studio?
[21:28:44] <xMopx> seems to have the worst fanboyism, second to perhaps elixir
[21:29:01] <skye0> javascript? yeah, because like call of duty, they force people to give a fuck about them
[21:30:02] <skye0> "we're so loved because we're so easy to work with". nope, you're only so loved because you're the only programming language that works with anything that interfaces with the web beyond just mere networking
[21:30:20] <skye0> call of duty is the only way people can play team deathmatch, and is the only game out there focused on such
[21:30:29] <skye0> while other games are more focused on either being tactical or being battle royales
[21:30:56] <skye0> i digress
[21:32:42] <skye0> and call of duty releases a new game every year so it's impossible to ignore them in gaming
[21:33:40] <skye0> so yes, javascript is the call of duty of programming languages - only good for one thing and forces attention upon itself. if something else could take its place, both javascript and call of duty would be rapidly forgotten
[21:36:11] <joepie91> okay then, new channel rule, since apparently it's not clear to people that this is a part of "don't be an asshole". no technology bashing, javascript or otherwise. (constructive) criticism is fine. shitting on something for the sake of it, *especially* without understanding the thing you're shitting on, is not. take your religious wars elsewhere.
[21:37:07] <joepie91> you'd think that this would be obvious, but apparently not.
[21:39:11] <skye0> regarding javascript, nothing can easily replace it because 30 years ago it was cemented as the fundamental scripting language for the then nascent internet/web, but since the HTML-powered internet/web as we know it is shaping how we use software more and more, javascript seems to be less easily avoidable and seems to be trying to take on the purpose beyond its original intended scope (as nothing else was developed to interface with HTML in
[21:39:11] <skye0> the same way javascript could). javascript seems to have a more legitimate reason to exist even if it's the bane of programmers everywhere.
[21:39:28] <xMopx> lol, you labeling discussion of a view you disagree with as "bashing" tells us all we need to know about how you run this channel
[21:39:38] <xMopx> incredible
[21:40:21] <skye0> some people require the use of certain technologies even if derided publicly by the whole programming world
[21:40:55] *** not-joepie91 sets mode: +b xMopx!*@*
[21:40:56] *** xMopx was kicked by not-joepie91 (User terminated!)
[21:41:55] <joepie91> skye0: the early history in that is accurate, but JS hasn't been 'just a browser language' for a decade or so by this point
[21:42:04] <joepie91> and it's also extremely different today from how it was originally
[21:42:08] <joepie91> both in language itself and in ecosystem
[21:42:32] <skye0> call of duty, meanwhile, because of rape scandals with activision and blizzard, shouldn't have a legitimate reason to exist. for those who still enjoy first person shooters, in my experience, there seems to be largely only three types of games players could choose from - call of duty, battle royales and tactical shooters. there's very little that is none of those, with halo infinite being one of the very few exceptions to these - it's not call
[21:42:32] <skye0> of duty, it's not a battle royale, and while it has tactical game modes, it's not a central focus of the whole game experience.
[21:43:44] <skye0> joepie91 i am wondering why javascript remains the only thing that HTML can be interfaced with
[21:44:40] <joepie91> skye0: well... *sort of*. you can build things with WASM and have them interface with a webpage, and then there's only a bit of JS involved for the interoperability layer, and there's a few good reasons for that
[21:44:54] <skye0> and the only thing stopping javascript being the de-facto programming language for practically any use case are those use cases where javascript would be worse than, say, C++ (as an obvious example)
[21:45:16] <joepie91> the ones I can immediately think of being 1) the DOM API is defined in terms of JS functions, not independently from JS, and 2) WASM, while a good compilation target, is really too low-level to have a directly defined binding to "webpage stuff"
[21:45:36] <joepie91> eg. mutating a webpage without a GC involved somewhere along the line is a pain
[21:45:49] <joepie91> and WASM, by design, does not have a GC - but JS does
[21:46:15] <joepie91> so it makes a certain sense to have WASM as a compile target which can interact with JS, and then use JS for the icky bits of exposing a DOM API
[21:46:55] <joepie91> there's no *fundamental* reason you couldn't replace JS as "the thing that interacts with HTML", but realistically if you tried to do so, you'd end up with something that looks an awful lot *like* JS
[21:47:07] <joepie91> so there's just not much point to it
[21:47:41] <skye0> so, it's probably a bit linked with how HTML was set up?
[21:47:41] <joepie91> HTML, the DOM API, and JS all co-evolved, and so it's hard to find a better fit than the parts that are already there
[21:47:45] <joepie91> yeah
[21:47:58] <skye0> tbf i haven't really researched this topic in depth because i'm very interested in web stuff (I'm more generally inspired by programs that either don't need a connection or make very basic use of networking tools and do not require a browser to operate)
[21:48:08] <skye0> ,s/very/not very
[21:48:08] <unfinity> 04<skye0> tbf i haven't really researched this topic in depth because i'm not very interested in web stuff (I'm more generally inspired by programs that either don't need a connection or make not very basic use of networking tools and do not require a browser to operate)
[21:48:28] <joepie91> right
[21:48:58] <joepie91> the very simple summary of web stuff is "yes, it's complicated, but there's a good reason why it's complicated, so while it's certainly not without its flaws, your idea of what those flaws are is probably wrong if you haven't researched it in depth"
[21:49:09] <joepie91> general you, not personal you :p
[21:49:21] <skye0> i've used this command a few times in vim, but forgot that unfinity would be overzealous with these substitutions
[21:50:16] <skye0> gonna need to consider taking a nap, i'm still on my leave and i should still try to make the most of it
[21:50:52] <joepie91> if you think of browsers and web technologies as "a universal operating system that uniformly works cross-platform all around the world on basically every device, with seamless integration between information and functionality, and globally interconnected services", then it becomes a bit more clear why non-obvious design decisions in it might have a good reason that you'd only discover upon deeper research
[21:52:57] <skye0> the main problem with the current state of web tech is that it's dominated by two engines, one of which is surviving only for the highly privacy conscious, and the main developer of this engine (Mozilla) has had so much crap going on with it many are losing faith in the organization as it stands to feeling more like a generic US tech company over than the more principled organizations like the EFF (US) or ORG (UK)
[21:54:58] <joepie91> yep, that I fully agree with
[21:55:09] <joepie91> and it's hugely concerning
[21:59:49] <skye0> it's complex because if you think about it, if Mozilla doesn't support any of the widely derided features like DRM or certain invasive JS code or whatever, they could lose even more users who happen to require it even for occasional access (i.e. those who refuse to use or cannot use anything Chromium derived on their systems as they may be unable to afford computers that support it or may require their existing systems for various unrelated
[21:59:49] <skye0> purposes). losing users would mean that they'd have even less reason to exist in the eyes of basically organizations like the FCC or whoever tries to keep the internet in check these days
[22:00:44] <joepie91> I mean, on the one hand, yeah, but it's definitely not just 'tough choices' on Mozilla's side
[22:00:49] <joepie91> there's also just a whole lot of mismanagement
[22:00:53] <skye0> yup
[22:00:57] <joepie91> and they could be doing much better under the current circumstances
[22:01:01] <joepie91> if they actually started listening to criticism
[22:01:25] <joepie91> particularly the "you are not a tech startup, stop behaving like one, behave like the non-profit internet steward you're supposed to be instead" criticism
[22:01:56] <skye0> i.e. the internet and IT these days seems to be run even more on neoliberal money making principles
[22:02:12] <joepie91> for sure
[22:03:07] <skye0> hence why mozilla is behaving like a tech startup, because current policy and the way things are going are basically strangling anyone who can't offer money. heck, this reminds me of how that fascist bolsonaro wanted universities to be just places to "shape" the "free market" instead of be "indoctrination chambers"
[22:03:18] <joepie91> nah, Mozilla could be doing much better
[22:03:26] <joepie91> in fact, they are in a uniquely good position to break that mold
[22:03:44] <joepie91> they have funding that's fairly guaranteed, they have a lot of competent technical folks, they have the 'brand recognition'
[22:03:52] <joepie91> they even have Firefox, as a very big pawn to move around in the browser space
[22:04:30] <joepie91> along with Wikipedia and the Internet Archive, they are one of the very few 'internet behemoths' who are in a position to genuinely push online change at scale against neoliberal policies
[22:04:35] <skye0> yeah, mismanagement and the mentality of some people are really fucking over the whole open source community, i.e. any open source project that needs to work with browsers or the web
[22:05:52] <joepie91> (also, this makes it all the more frustrating that they're wasting that potential and just kinda letting it rot away)
[22:06:10] <joepie91> I'd consider it a form of institutional corruption tbh
[22:06:23] <skye0> yup
[22:06:23] <joepie91> similar to how Wikipedia mismanages funds
[22:06:33] <joepie91> at least the IA seems to be doing pretty good
[22:06:39] <skye0> IA?
[22:06:44] <joepie91> Internet Archive, archive.org
[22:06:50] <skye0> ah, yes
[22:07:12] <joepie91> they've done a few questionable things but they're the kind of questionable things that are likely to happen in any large-ish organization
[22:07:21] <joepie91> no fundamental rot that I can see
[22:07:33] <skye0> would be best to get into direct action if charity is not working. would like to try and stop the web from getting worse than it is but i'm still essentially starting out with my IT knowledge and resources
[22:07:46] <skye0> the EFF are a nice and principled organization IME too
[22:07:59] <joepie91> while true, the EFF are mainly lawyers
[22:08:15] <skye0> also why it seems to be a good idea to have an independent networking protocol that's largely independent of HTML when HTML is at the mercy of corporate strangleholds, and why i'm kind of inspired by projects that do not require a browser and require the most basic of networking. mainly, i just don't really get inspired by web-based projects because of how much focus there is on that already
[22:08:16] <joepie91> they do have influence on things, but it's not the same kind of 'applied influence' that IA/wikipedia/mozilla have
[22:08:39] <joepie91> skye0: replacing HTML is not the solution
[22:09:08] <joepie91> web standards didn't magically get corrupted, that has a cause; and if you don't eliminate that cause, then anything new you build will suffer the same corruption
[22:09:17] <joepie91> except your new thing won't be compatible with the existing stuff
[22:09:31] <joepie91> so you just end up splitting one broken ecosystem into two broken ecosystems
[22:09:48] <skye0> i wouldn't replace it, just offer an alternative for those who need something to use where HTML falls short, like privacy. i don't anticipate anything could feasibly replace HTML anyway
[22:10:09] <joepie91> HTML does not really have any privacy implications that aren't fundamental to what makes the web works
[22:10:16] <sarnold> replacing html for the public at large feels pretty impractical, but the gemini folks seem to beh aving fun
[22:10:16] <joepie91> s/works/work/
[22:10:34] <joepie91> honestly HTML itself is actually quite good
[22:10:56] <joepie91> most of the standards corruption is happening around JS and more specifically browser APIs
[22:10:59] <sarnold> I wish browsers had held the line on "the input must vlidate before we render anything"

[22:11:16] <skye0> yeah. it's just sad that the latest standards of HTML, or probably rather, some websites that use a specific combination of HTML, CSS and JS, require the two largely monolithic web engines

[22:11:32] <joepie91> right, yeah, that's definitely not a HTML thing
[22:11:53] <joepie91> to some degree it's CSS and to a larger degree it's browser APIs
[22:12:58] <joepie91> Google has been massively inflating browser APIs lately, at a pace that frankly nobody else can keep up with
[22:13:04] <joepie91> and often with questionable designs for questionable reasons
[22:13:27] <joepie91> likewise, TC39 (the standards committee for JS) is mainly Google-led
[22:13:37] <joepie91> and they've been adding a lot of questionable stuff to the language
[22:14:14] <joepie91> in fact, if anything, JS has been moving closer *towards* being a browser-only language again, with many recent design decisions seemingly being informed by, bluntly put, "whatever Google needs to implement their ideas"
[22:14:24] <joepie91> (in Chrome)
[22:14:24] <skye0> also a lot of big tech companies are kind of required to help maintain the whole military industrial complex anyway - if they didn't benefit monetarily from advertisement or other forms of surveillance, the government would

[22:45:41] <skye0> based off of this thread, so far, the problem with JS proponents is that i've not heard many issues with how their language seems to be held hostage by commercial entities, and just seem to be happy to see it used or usasble virtually anywhere, like it were the new BASIC
[22:46:35] <skye0> for me, since it was initially and, as you've mentioned, is turning back into, being a web-exclusive programming language, i generally have no interest in it, as someone whose only interest with the web is mainly using it and scraping off of it
