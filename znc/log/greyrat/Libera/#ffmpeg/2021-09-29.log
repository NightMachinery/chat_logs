[01:52:23] <aphysically> softworkz: oh hey
[01:52:41] <softworkz> hi
[01:52:51] <aphysically> I've been following your subtitle patches
[01:53:06] <softworkz> glad to hear :-)
[01:53:21] <aphysically> were there any plans to combine the regular text/video rendering filter for subtitles or is there a need to keep them separate?
[01:54:01] <softworkz> what do you mean by regular t/v rendering filters?
[01:54:16] *** Joins: s0berage (~s0berage@135-23-213-77.cpe.pppoe.ca)
[01:55:12] <aphysically> there's overlay_textsubs and overlay_graphicsubs
[01:55:22] <aphysically> if there's an overlay_subs as well that only takes S->V
[01:55:32] <aphysically> then you can use it without caring the type of subtitles it is
[01:55:48] <softworkz> no, these are way too different
[01:56:20] <aphysically> I think Lynne had mentioned this in a comment too but it got lost in the ML
[01:56:36] <aphysically> ah okay then
[01:56:37] <softworkz> just look at this example: https://streams.videolan.org/samples/sub/SSA/subtitle_testing_complex.mkv
[01:56:45] <softworkz> to see what ass subtitles can do
[01:57:12] <softworkz> look at the note bar animation at the bottom
[01:57:25] <aphysically> yes I actually do a lot of nonsense for ass subtitles in my rendering code right now
[01:58:13] <softworkz> depending on the OS, you need to provide proper paths to fonts etc to make subtitle rendering work
[01:58:31] <aphysically> I also need to read what kind of scaling (if any) the overlay_graphicsubs does or if I need to subs2video first
[01:58:34] <softworkz> so you need to be prepared for it
[01:58:50] <softworkz> sub2video doesn't exist anymore
[01:59:10] <aphysically> well then it's relevant, does it scale to the video you're overlaying?
[01:59:11] <softworkz> it is substituted by auto-inserting graphicsub2video
[01:59:43] <softworkz> With graphicsub2video, you can scale manually, but then you have the same disadvantage like all the time before:
[01:59:47] <softworkz> performance
[01:59:53] <aphysically> oh I thought you meant graphicsub2video doesn't exist anymore
[02:00:03] <softworkz> as you need to scale the whole overlay image
[02:00:09] <softworkz> graphicsub2video is new
[02:00:18] <aphysically> does the regular overlay one scale at all?
[02:00:19] <softworkz> It's the replacement for sub2video
[02:00:30] <softworkz> Wait
[02:00:53] <softworkz> the best performance is achieved by overlaying only the individual subtitle bitmaps
[02:01:05] <softworkz> that reduces the work to those small regions
[02:01:15] <softworkz> the filter for this is overlay_graphicsubs
[02:01:23] <softworkz> And you are right:
[02:01:33] <softworkz> there's one bit missing in that game
[02:01:50] <softworkz> scaling of graphic subtitle bitmaps (individually)
[02:02:10] <aphysically> yeah, so in my code right now I do it with scale2ref: https://github.com/GBeauregard/pyffstream/blob/c64671cb5dbac7796304dda8960eb482527bc48d/src/pyffstream/encode.py#L1181
[02:02:14] <softworkz> and this is the very last piece of the puzzle on which I'm working right now
[02:03:22] <softworkz> scaling 2 ref is not something I've planned, though (yet)
[02:03:43] <softworkz> because in our use cases, we always do probing first, so we know the target video sizes
[02:04:18] <aphysically> if this is implemented as part of the overlay filter you already have the ref
[02:04:45] <aphysically> well, I use it where I may or may not be overlaying after an autodetected crop fitler
[02:04:46] <softworkz> yes, but then it's too late
[02:05:10] <aphysically> I can read the size from the crop filter in advance I guess
[02:05:27] <softworkz> meaning that the sub bitmaps will need to be scaled each time when doing overlay
[02:06:13] <softworkz> the new subscale filter will also have a number of operation modes
[02:06:31] <softworkz> not only scale, but also something like 'fit' or 'rearrange'
[02:06:56] <aphysically> ah okay you're doing an entire subscale filter that's nice
[02:07:02] <softworkz> ..to move subtitle bitmaps to fit into a certain target frame and scale only when necessary
[02:07:03] *** Joins: jess (~jess@libera/staff/jess)
[02:07:14] <aphysically> yeah actually very often when cropping if it's HDMV subtitles sometimes they're designed to be placed on the video already
[02:07:26] <aphysically> so it's wrong to scale it to the video after cropping
[02:07:44] <aphysically> I actually handle this right now by just manually having an option to crop *after* subtitles are rendered if I know this is the case in advance
[02:07:53] <softworkz> sometimes there bitmap subs for 16:9  but the video is like 22:10
[02:08:08] <softworkz> and it's sufficient to move them up and down
[02:08:23] *** Quits: SpeakerToMeat__ (~Speaker@user/speakertomeat) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[02:08:31] <aphysically> yes, then you don't have to scale them smaller anymore
[02:08:59] <aphysically> this is very nice :)
[02:09:08] *** Joins: SpeakerToMeat__ (~Speaker@user/speakertomeat)
[02:09:16] <softworkz> I've taken quite some effort during the past days to scale those fonts smoothly, though, when scaling is needed
[02:09:20] <softworkz> thx
[02:09:25] <aphysically> actually exceeds my expectation
[02:09:35] <softworkz> :-)
[02:10:11] <softworkz> I'm having practical use cases, it's not an academic effort
[02:11:26] <aphysically> I'm also glad seeking to a timestamp with -t shouldn't be completely broken anymore
[02:11:59] <aphysically> right now I unconditionally extract any textsubs to a separate file if I have any intent to use them, since it's really the only way that isn't broken in *some* way (timestamp seeking or otherwise)
[02:12:20] <softworkz> let me know when you come across an example that doesn't work
[02:12:56] <aphysically> with your patches, you mean?
[02:13:10] <softworkz> the original motivation for this way about ass overlay with vf_subttitles, because vf_subtitles reads the entire video a second time
[02:13:19] <softworkz> yes, with my patches
[02:13:31] <aphysically> ^^^^^ this is another reason I unconditionally extracted it
[02:13:38] <softworkz> exactly
[02:13:54] <aphysically> my problem was when I'm using vf_subtitles with SRT streaming the reading of the entire video took long enough that the SRT times out and disconnects
[02:14:10] <aphysically> so vf_subtitles was just unusable with SRT output protocol
[02:14:11] <softworkz> ;-)
[02:14:23] <softworkz> we had the same problems
[02:15:10] <softworkz> especially, when users were storing content on nas devices with bad SMB implementations
[02:15:52] <softworkz> and when the source is a stream from somewhere, it doesn't work at all
[02:16:14] <aphysically> if I'm not unconditionally extracting anymore the startup time will be a lot faster
[02:16:36] <aphysically> although the code won't be in vain, I actually use the extracting to fix some bugs with ffconcat and ass
[02:17:37] <aphysically> https://trac.ffmpeg.org/ticket/9001
[02:17:49] <softworkz> I might not be able to solve all problems, but at least a few big ones
[02:18:22] <aphysically> yeah this is unrelated to your (great!)
[02:18:23] <aphysically> work
[02:18:51] <softworkz> note the following regarding ass:
[02:19:10] <softworkz> it doesn't matter at all in which frames the ass subs are contained
[02:19:39] <softworkz> the only thing that matters is the timing within the ass events
[02:20:02] <aphysically> yeah this all was a bit confusing when I originally was debugging this
[02:20:16] <aphysically> the mkvtoolnix dev finally helped figure it out and fixed the same bug in mkvmerge
[02:20:48] <softworkz> a file could even have the complete ass subtitles at the beginning
[02:21:07] <softworkz> which would be unfortunate when seeking,
[02:21:25] <softworkz> but it would still work otherwise

[02:23:42] <softworkz> if you have a test file for reproducing, I could check whether/how it would work with my filters
[02:24:06] <aphysically> oh, yeah, there's test files attached to the trac bug
[02:24:27] <aphysically> should be drop in I think https://trac.ffmpeg.org/ticket/9001
[02:25:48] <aphysically> the bug is in the mkv muxer of ffmpeg, but depending on how the new subtitle filters work it may not even run into it
[02:26:23] <softworkz> it will still run into it, at least without filtering
[02:26:44] <softworkz> with filtering, I can't say, but probably still
[02:26:56] <aphysically> and/or in the ffconcat demuxer or whatever
[02:27:23] <aphysically> mpv doesn't choke on the dupe frame number files and still renders okay, so I'm not sure what they're doing different

[02:49:31] <tar_xvf> but is the only way by making a complicated mathematical formula for the position over time or is there another filter than can handle this, as well as zooming in and out?

[11:46:26] <aphysically> huh when I copy video but not audio and time seek I end up with the audio out of sync (looks like file has positive start_time)
[11:49:01] <aphysically> looks like the timing is okay if I slowseek instead of fastseek
[11:51:51] <aphysically> I guess I can just always enable slow seeking when trying to copy the video stream

[12:28:29] <aleek> hello! we are using ffmpeg to transcode live channels. We have a problem with couple of channels. I checked the input packets (mpegts), and it seems like there's a packet loss and out of ordering, like this: AAAAAAAAAABABABABABBBBBBBBBB. This results in incorrect output stream. I can see, that ffmpeg is conducting its internal clock with input video stream. Is there a way to set ffmpeg to create
[12:28:31] <aleek> output clock by itself, so it can recover from this?
[12:28:54] <aleek> I suspect that it could result in audio/video desync, bo we wanna try this anyway

[17:37:47] <Hello71> iirc x11grab has no synchronization at all, it just copies out a frame roughly every 1/fps seconds

[20:44:27] <swimm3r> Hello. I am trying to convert a stream from an online radio (format mp3) and convert it to wav, and send the data to stdout (done that), but I do not know how to read the metadata of the stream when it is changed. The metadata is read only at the begining. Can anyone help me? Thanks.
[20:45:18] <JEEB> sounds like you want an API client since I'm pretty sure there was some side data or flag that happens when metadata gets updated
[20:45:36] <JEEB> ffmpeg.c is very static so probably not going to do that
[20:46:10] <tar_xvf> i don't know if or how you can do that with ffmpeg but you could periodically run ffprobe periodically to read the metadata

[20:52:30] <tar_xvf> Hello all, I'm wondering if it's possible to use the zoompan filter with video. All the examples I have tried just do the effect on the first frame as a screenshot, or in slow-motion
[20:54:03] <durandal_1707> yes, its possible
[20:54:34] <durandal_1707> following examples without understanding is like walking blind

[21:02:48] <Gaboradon> hello
[21:03:39] <Gaboradon> Is it normal for audio convertion to be off by the marked -ss -to time slices?

[21:07:07] <durandal_1707> off by how much?
[21:09:40] <Gaboradon> Because my AV1/OPUS MKV file (youtube) converted to audio codec pcm_s24le is not respecting the start field accurately, the extracted audio starts too early by 3 seconds and 2 frames (Davinci Resolve Timeline 30FPS, but video is 29.7)
[21:10:37] <Gaboradon> Well, actually, now that I said it, i didn't check if perhaps the video starts too late by same 3 s amount, audio is longer the video, thankfully AV Sync is okay and the -to end times are correct and match perfectly
[21:11:28] <Gaboradon> Video was converted from AV1 to H264, for some reason Davinci Resolve doesn't support AV1 in MKV (even tho it added MKV and AV1 support a while ago, i guess it's still WIP)
[21:13:15] *** Joins: stevenliu (~stevenliu@ffmpeg/developer/stevenliu)
[21:13:36] <Gaboradon> Oh guys, sorry, I think ... the clip I'm converting/extracting from was separately copied by ffmpeg before
[21:14:38] <Gaboradon> So I made a -ss -to copy all streams in a separate step before, I can see in MPV player it starts at 3 seconds where the video starts, won't let me go below 3s where the audio starts
[21:15:51] <tar_xvf> sometimes using the -c copy option will not start and stop at the exact moment you intend, especially with video.
[21:16:39] <Gaboradon> I think I did separately, ffmpeg -i source.mp4 -ss -to -vcodec copy -acodec copy -f matroska out.mkv
[21:17:33] <tar_xvf> no, it is still the case.

[21:29:36] <aphysically> but if a stream is being copied I'm not sure what to do, it's complicated in general
[21:30:13] <aphysically> ideally mpegts could figure this out since then I could remove a lot of seeking code that fixes this for files that have streams with start_times set
[21:32:12] <aphysically> for now maybe I need code that always snaps video seek to nearest keyframe if the video stream is being copied?

[23:07:30] <andai> (It will take ten hours to render)
[23:08:15] <tar_xvf> andai if you are gonna try with ffmpeg further, i would suggest re-encode the video with the following filter: `-vf "drawtext=fontfile=Arial.ttf: text='%{frame_num}': start_number=0: x=(w-tw)/2: y=h-(2*lh): fontcolor=black: fontsize=20: box=1: boxcolor=white: boxborderw=5"`, so that you can see the frame-number, for the loop command
