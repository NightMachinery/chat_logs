[02:28:14] <headius> kares: I got this error trying to run rspec-rails CI, does it look familiar? `TypeError: superclass mismatch for class Cipher`
[02:28:29] <headius> and a ton of warnings about openssl constants already being defined... it's clearly double-loading
[02:32:04] <headius> nightly snapshots appear to be working now
[02:32:09] <headius> on master
[02:32:17] <headius> 9.3 is still set to only snapshot when build is green
[02:34:36] <headius> oops this might be my range fix PR breaking other stuff
[02:34:41] <headius> bunch of suites failed too
[03:03:24] <headius> Nope still same output

[08:44:38] <kares[m]> meh, does not look familiar - why would jossl double load
[08:54:57] <kares[m]> so the rspec-rails suite failed using the 9.4 SNAPSHOT?
[08:55:13] <headius> 9.3 head
[08:55:35] <headius> It also fails for them, which is why I'm looking into it, but the error is something completely different
[08:56:30] <headius> https://github.com/rspec/rspec-rails/pull/2580
[09:05:28] <kares[m]> let me try locally using jruby-9.3 branch, what command did you run?
[09:07:17] <headius> There are a set of shell scripts they run in CI but mostly 'bundle install --binstubs' with env RAILS_VERSION=~>6.1 or something like that, and then there's a run script
[09:07:43] <headius> I am bot at computer but have a look at the workflow
[09:07:50] <headius> I have not figured out the right way to just run the failing stuff
[09:08:00] <headius> Just started looking at it towards the end of the day today
[09:10:00] <kares[m]> okay will try that - they seem to have also reproduced using released 9.3.3
[09:10:24] <headius> Yeah I had them try upgrading
[11:04:12] <kares[m]> run the specs with a local jruby-9.3 SNAPSHOT build using `../jruby/bin/jruby -v -S rake spec`
[11:04:12] <kares[m]> jruby 9.3.4.0-SNAPSHOT (2.6.8) 2022-03-15 b788e506c8 Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM 11.0.13+10-LTS-370 on 11.0.13+10-LTS-370 +jit [x86_64-linux]
[11:04:12] <kares[m]> all seems to have gone fine

[20:00:54] <byteit101[m]> Is there anything left for me to do on my @ivar PR? I think I'm done with it
[20:08:59] <enebo[m]> byteit101: Sorry we will get it in soon
[20:09:44] <byteit101[m]> No problem
