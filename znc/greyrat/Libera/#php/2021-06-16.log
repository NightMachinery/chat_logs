[01:01:37] <stenno> oh fair
[01:01:50] <TinoDidriksen> They split the network into new and old, with new having none of the registered channels or nicks.
[01:02:15] <TinoDidriksen> And the old was shut down an hour ago.

[04:29:59] <BadAdviceCat> The real differences we'll get are the property accessors. If it lands in PHP 8.1
[04:30:21] <ramsey> and enums
[04:31:30] <BadAdviceCat> One could argue you do the same using __get/set magic methods, but not quite the same. Well same end result I guess, but far less if/else/switch/match conditions and the code would be far better and we can replace get/set.

[06:01:40] <__adrian> not clear what would happen if  $r =& $obj->obj; $r = new Obj();  but the array example ...implies? it would actually replace the original object

[06:14:49] <__adrian> but maybe i just need someone to talk at me about it for a while
[06:14:55] <ramsey> What do you mean by the “default getter?”
[06:15:06] <__adrian> get;  vs.  get { ... }
[06:15:30] <ramsey> Which one do you consider the “default?”
[06:15:57] <__adrian> the one where the programmer does not provide an implementation
[06:16:24] <__adrian> iirc it was evendescribed as "default" in previous rfcs, though that doesn't strictly matter here
[06:16:29] <ramsey> Gotcha. Does byref work for the other format?
[06:16:41] <__adrian> afaict?
[06:16:41] <ramsey> The block format
[06:16:59] <ramsey> That doesn’t seem like it makes much sense
[06:17:19] <__adrian> public $prop { &get { /* My new get */ } }  // legal
[06:17:32] <ramsey> Hmm
[06:17:48] <ramsey> I don’t understand how that works
[06:17:55] <__adrian> that's in the inheritance section
[06:18:04] <__adrian> "badly" is the only way i can imagine
[06:18:31] <__adrian> it assumes your custom method does  return $this->actualProperty;
[06:18:57] <__adrian> or, i assume it assumes
[06:19:19] <entuland> that stuff is giving me headaches already
[06:19:34] <__adrian> i assume you mean the assumptions
[06:20:30] <entuland> oh well, I'll learn, gotta be positive
[06:20:53] <__adrian> lack or isset/unset could be a good thing
[06:20:54] <Blondie101010> it looks Chinese but seems to make sense
[06:21:09] <__adrian> limits the dumb things you could otherwise do
[06:21:10] <entuland> unless someone redefines "being positive" to do something else
[06:21:14] <entuland> then I'd be screwed
[06:21:56] <ramsey> Under “property compatibility” (at the bottom, it says:
[06:21:56] <ramsey> “This restriction exists, because accessors, even in their most general form, do not support certain behavior. In particular, while it is possible to take a reference to an accessor property (as long as it uses &get), it's not possible to assign a reference to an accessor property:”
[06:22:07] <ramsey> And look at the example
[06:22:16] <__adrian> though imo  unset($obj->foo)  where  foo ?something  should be legal

[06:23:49] <__adrian> which is def good/sane but not the whole of what i dislike

[06:24:51] <ramsey> *though
[06:26:32] <__adrian> actually i think we're both misreading it
[06:26:43] <ramsey> Haha
[06:26:44] <__adrian> but couldn't say without testing
[06:26:45] <ramsey> Probably
[06:27:04] <ramsey> This is a really dense RFC
[06:27:33] <ramsey> Lots of considerations, since there’s a lot of new syntax being introduced
[06:28:23] <__adrian> X { public $p { &get; } }  $r = $x->p; $r = $P;  is different than just  $X->p = $P;
[06:28:37] <__adrian> or maybe it's not really
[06:29:36] <ramsey> Good question. I would think that would have the same effect
[06:29:38] <__adrian> but the examples make me think so
[06:30:18] <__adrian> that example where they assign a complete new array
[06:30:37] <ramsey> Nikita has a PR for this. I could build it and try it out, but I’m not at my computer right now
[06:30:57] <__adrian> i am holding a baby

[06:31:24] <__adrian> esp since she loves keyboards
[06:34:34] <__adrian> from an "i bet it's implemented like {...}" perspective, i think they'd be different. but that would be surprising from an "hi i'm writing code' perspective
[06:34:54] <ramsey> Speaking of 8.1; the first alpha release was last week. Doesn’t have property accessors, but it does have the other things already accepted
[06:35:17] <__adrian> probably dense  :)
[06:35:35] <ramsey> And second alpha is next week

[07:00:49] <ramsey> __adrian: so, did y’all lose the channel over on Freenode? I lost all mine and my nick. :-(
[07:01:15] <__adrian> yeah, everything's gone for everyone
[07:01:39] <__adrian> they have one new server and zero old servers
[07:02:49] <__adrian> there's still a ##php, of course, and a couple hundred people were apparently set up to autojoin it  :)  but we don't control it anymore. we'll see how long they let us sit there pointing people at libera
[07:03:05] <ramsey> I registered my nick again so no one could impersonate me, but they might enforce their active nick policy. Or they might just drop the DB every few months.
[07:03:26] <__adrian> that's a good point... i guess i should too
[07:04:02] <ramsey> I also registered #phpc over there, for the same reason, but I didn’t bother with the rest of my channels
[07:05:03] <__adrian> me either
[07:06:50] <ramsey> I’m trying to get #phpc- registered as a community prefix over here, and I’ve already set up a bunch of Matrix bridges under the “namespace” `:phpc.chat` (which is a resolving domain name to a Rocket Chat instance, but I’ll shut that down soon)
[07:07:20] *** pizzaiolo is now known as pizza
[07:07:52] <ramsey> RocketChat was an interesting experiment, but without federation and good, transparent bridges to IRC, it’s not very useful

[08:08:29] <montybanksnyc> What the hell happened to freenode? Just logged in after a few months and saw only crickets there

[08:09:03] <__adrian> tl;dr: it got worse from there
[08:10:36] <__adrian> sometime yesterday (maybe earlier?), existing freenode servers became gone, including DBs (i.e., channels and nicks). so it's formally gone now. what you logged onto is a new server

[10:21:57] <ericlee> Hi, I found 2 interesting issues when I use fread() / Fwrite() and fflush. The first thing is it seems each time fread() and fwrite can only read 8KB bytes at most. for example. if I set read and write buffer to 32KB, what happens is php will call 4 times read() then 4 times write() to achieve the 32 KB buffer read and write. Are they expected? Also, when I call fflush($fd) I didn't see any difference to trace the system calls. My OS is Linux and 
[10:21:57] <ericlee> PHP version is 7.4.20. 
[10:22:58] <ericlee> this is the example code: https://pastebin.com/9ua0FERV

[11:00:06] <TinoDidriksen> That's a pretty good buffer size.
[11:00:07] <biberu> ramsey, fukawi2: the splat operator is often used together with variadic functions, but they are different concepts. you can splat into argument lists of fixed lengths too, or e.g. into arrays: [...[1,2],...[3,4]] => [1,2,3,4]
[11:02:05] *** Joins: undefined_bob (~undefined@user/undefined-bob/x-5411918)
[11:05:21] <fukawi2> biberu: yeah,  in this case the author is just using it to do a foreach over a variable length list of files to unlink() but we're having trouble with it, and having never seen it before I wanted to understand if there were any tricks or corner cases with it.

[11:10:05] <TinoDidriksen> stream interface, so an 8 KiB buffer makes a lot of sense. It's big enough to not slow down I/O, but small enough to detect errors early.

[21:25:54] <stenno> there is no general answer to this
[21:26:04] <stenno> it depends on where you live and work
[21:26:09] <TML> Northwoods: Anywhere from minimum wage to "as much as you are able to negotiate"
[21:26:16] <Northwoods> remote , and working for North America
[21:27:00] <TML> Northwoods: in one case, I negotiated a rate of $225/hour for PHP work
[21:27:11] <Northwoods> USD ?
[21:27:13] <TML> yes
[21:27:24] <Northwoods> thats crazy number
[21:27:28] <TML> in other cases, I've had a hard time getting people to pay even $100
[21:27:31] <Northwoods> but beliveable
[21:27:34] <TML> not $100/h
[21:27:43] <stenno> 200 euro is probably what my boss gets for my work
[21:27:44] <TML> $100 flat rate on a project basis
[21:27:56] <TML> it just all depends on what you can negotiate
[21:28:06] <Northwoods> stenno, 200 euro per hour ?
[21:28:10] <stenno> yaeh
[21:28:18] <Northwoods> lol , wow
[21:28:26] <stenno> but thats what my boss gets lol
[21:28:29] <stenno> not me
[21:28:32] <Northwoods> thanks that gives me rough idea
[21:28:44] <Northwoods> stenno, lol , yes
[21:29:06] <stenno> but sure, especially if you are freelancer, its exactly like TML said
[21:29:13] <Northwoods> ok
[21:29:14] <TML> We currently have architects that bill out at over $600/h
[21:29:21] <robertparkerx> What does it mean when it says mixed https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.in-array.php
[21:29:36] <TML> robertparkerx: It means it allows multiple types
[21:29:44] <Northwoods> TML,  system architects ?
[21:29:47] <robertparkerx> is there any limit TML ?
[21:29:59] <robertparkerx> I'm looking really if it will accept arrays too
[21:30:05] <robertparkerx> for needle
[21:30:23] <TML> robertparkerx: Generally, if you read the full documentation, it explains what the accepted types are, and what it does differently as a result
[21:30:30] <stenno> can you loose compare arrays in php? i doubt it
[21:30:40] <TML> robertparkerx: But no, you cannot search an array for an array
[21:31:10] <robertparkerx> Sorry

[21:33:18] <Northwoods> Rockwood_, i don't think so
[21:33:32] <TML> Northwoods: No, software architects
[21:33:33] <stenno> in_array([1,2], [[2,1]]) would be true also 
[21:33:42] <Rockwood_> Northwoods, having less money as per our location

[21:34:07] <Northwoods> yes , remote is good

[21:34:32] <Northwoods> yeah i know , you work for wine
[21:34:39] <stenno> in_array([1,2], [[2,1]]) is false

[21:34:42] <robertparkerx> I think you're right though TML it doesn't

[21:35:03] <TML> robertparkerx: It appears to work, but perhaps not in the way you intended
[21:35:04] <Northwoods> nice
[21:35:12] <stenno> in_array([1,2], [[1,2]]) is true

[21:36:56] <Rockwood_> dammit English
[21:36:58] <Rockwood_> lol
[21:37:41] <stenno> i understand now why in_array([1,2], [[2,1]]) is false
[21:37:55] <Rockwood_> Northwoods, frontend is more costly 
[21:38:06] <stenno> its [0 => 1, 1 => 2] vs. [ 0 => 2, 1 => 1]
[21:38:12] <stenno> so it will be false for == equality
[21:38:26] <Northwoods> Rockwood_, yes could be
[21:38:41] <TML> robertparkerx: it may also depend on your PHP version, check the docs to see if this behaviour has changed

[22:17:54] <__adrian> i guess the plus is that everybody gets talking to each other again  :p
[22:18:29] <ramsey> TML: so, to answer your question from a few days ago, yes, phpc is now “officially” moving over here :-)
[22:18:34] <TML> :)
[22:18:38] <TML> I figured
[22:18:50] <TML> they kind of forced it
[22:19:12] <ramsey> TML: I’m trying to get the community/project team over here to grant me access to register the channel
[22:19:41] <ramsey> or “claim” it, or whatever; they’re swamped, so it’ll be a while
[22:19:42] <TML> ramsey: They've been pretty reasonable, just a bit backed up
[22:19:55] <TML> I might be able to do it, let me try
[22:20:08] <TML> Nope
[22:20:15] <ramsey> Do you have admin access on the network?
[22:20:18] <TML> No
[22:20:28] <TML> but we control the "PHP group" here
[22:20:34] <__adrian> no, but we can claim anything that starts with  "php-"
[22:20:37] <TML> so we can claim "#php-*"
[22:20:38] <ramsey> Oh, did you get access to `#php-` channels?

[22:20:46] <ramsey> Nice
[22:20:48] <TML> I wasn't sure if that would extend too #phpc
[22:20:51] <TML> it does not
[22:21:14] <ramsey> I put you down as a “group” member, though
[22:21:41] <ramsey> So, when it’s granted, you can claim rooms under `#phpc-`

[22:22:00] <TML> it's slow going
[22:22:27] <TML> not like I didn't have anything else going this week :)
[22:22:45] <ramsey> I’m also going to plumb it into a Matrix channel in the `:phpc.chat` namespace
[22:23:12] <ramsey> I’ve already done that for other `#phpc-` channels on here
[22:25:53] <TML> I haven't dug into Matrix yet - keep seeing it float around
[22:26:35] <ramsey> I’m learning it. For setting up channels, etc., there’s a bit of a learning curve.
[22:27:45] <ramsey> Especially if you want to use your own “namespace” (i.e., `:phpc.chat` instead of `:matrix.org`)
[22:29:39] <ramsey> But I at least have `#phpc:phpc.chat` set up as a channel that will hook up to #phpc on here, once I get op access here, and I’m chatting here on Matrix through `#php:libera.chat`, which is just a straight “portal” channel to Libera.

[23:56:49] <AllenJB> Then your code is doing something that's using up all available memory. Fatal errors like memory exhausted cannot be caught
[23:58:05] <AllenJB> (And in PHP 5 errors were never thrown - they cannot be caught with try/catch and you'd have to use an error handler to "catch" them)
[23:59:24] <sstory> Roger that.  I know when I choose a date range too large and get too many records, stored in array to display in grid it crashes. I just thought I would catch instead of not showing anything.
