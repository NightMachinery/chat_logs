[18:30:51] <dodo> aw, too bad, had interviewed for a cool sounding position, some netbox dev and infra automation.. didn't get it
[18:31:06] <rawtaz> naww :(
[18:31:19] <rawtaz> do you know any particular reason or did they just have more candidates to harvest?
[18:31:31] <rawtaz> i mean so that you can get something useful out of it
[18:31:32] <dodo> nah, no feedback
[18:31:38] <rawtaz> suckers
[18:31:50] <dodo> i guess they must have had a more suited candidate.. which is good for them i guess, i was an almost perfect fit
[18:32:44] <dodo> though the interview was a little odd, only 30 minutes video call, no serious technical questions
[18:33:54] <rawtaz> yeah probably. unless you acted like a weirdo or didnt know jack shit it was just someone else had more experience with waht they needed
[18:34:11] <dodo> impossible, everybody loves me ;)
[18:34:22] <rawtaz> hah i had that too once. not a single technical question. but then again i had answered a bunch of technical questions before that so i guess they were happy
[18:34:25] <rawtaz> hehe true
[18:34:28] <rawtaz> that IS true
[18:34:37] <rawtaz> i sometimes watch your youtube channel and its lovely
[18:34:49] <dodo> wat? i'm not on youtube. must be an imposter

[18:48:44] <obviyus> quick q: how would you go about automatically deploying a new binary after it's built?
[18:49:00] <obviyus> e.g. for Docker i'd just use https://github.com/containrrr/watchtower
[18:49:28] <rawtaz> depends on where you want to deploy it and where you built it, i presume?
[18:50:02] <obviyus> rawtaz: it's a simple project, want to deploy it on a tiny VPS and built using GitHub Actions 
[18:50:17] <dodo> just deploy it using github actions?
[18:50:42] <obviyus> dodo: right, so do you mean something like scp'ing the binary to the VPS and restarting the service?
[18:50:50] <obviyus> i'm wondering if there's a better way :>
[18:50:53] <rawtaz> theres some action for that, im sure :D
[18:50:59] <obviyus> fair
[18:51:17] <dodo> obviyus: you probably want to ensure the new binary works on the server before overwriting the old one, but pretty much
[18:51:20] <rawtaz> or you could build it as a release in github and have your server pull that from github
[18:51:29] *** Joins: fling (~fling@user/fling)
[18:51:48] <obviyus> rawtaz: hmm that's actually not a bad idea, could setup a cron that gets the latest release 
[18:51:51] <obviyus> compare the hash maybe 
[18:53:08] <rawtaz> yeah or have github do a callback to the server
[18:53:13] <rawtaz> whatever is the simplest
[18:53:30] <obviyus> sounds good then
[18:53:34] <obviyus> ty dodo, rawtaz
