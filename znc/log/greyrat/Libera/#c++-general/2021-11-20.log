[00:26:47] <paul424> Is there some switch in g++ or clang which would speed up compilation ? In the sense , notice most of the time I don't want the binary blob to be build , but check for the syntax correctness

[00:28:14] <BucetaPeluda> with qt...
[00:28:25] <paul424> or generating the final binary code is such a tiny piece of compiler internals that it is not worth mentioing ?
[00:28:36] <BucetaPeluda> paul424, there are many of them

[01:13:32] <TheGuestMovie> I will hire depending on votes in this chatroom

[01:14:02] <kalven> how unprofessional
[01:14:03] <TheGuestMovie> I'm tilting towards the C# dev cause I figure he could help me for when I rewrite all our stuff in C#
[01:14:14] <TheGuestMovie> but that's 2 years away

[01:22:05] <TheGuestMovie> LordKalma: thoughts on Qt WebAssembly? I'm not likely to use it since it's not LGPL, just commercial or GPL.
[01:22:12] <TheGuestMovie> but I'm curious if it's nice
[01:24:06] <Alipha> TheGuestMovie: but the job is for doing c++? does the C# dev have any c++ experience?
[01:25:12] <TheGuestMovie> no, but he did a whole bunch of stuff in C# including backend, knows Linux, etc. So I figure it's easier to teach that guy enough C++/Qt in a few months, than to take a pure C++ programmer (student level of experience) and teach him years of software development
[01:28:10] <TheGuestMovie> Only annoying part is now I gotta setup Visual Studio for the C# guy's interview. I also had some prepared C++ questions specific to that language, I'd have to write the C# equivalent. Stuff like a program with tons of intentional errors, and they gotta get it to compile.
[01:32:28] <Alipha> yeah, go with the C# dev
[01:33:17] <TheGuestMovie> well, depends on how the interview goes, and Linux experience is a big factor too
[01:34:06] <Alipha> TheGuestMovie: also, what's wrong with Ubisoft? heh
[01:34:28] <BucetaPeluda> TheGuestMovie, what do you mean with Ubisoft zombie?

[01:37:54] <TheGuestMovie> there's other factors I guess, Ubisoft is downtown, and I'm on the periphery
[01:38:05] <InPhase> TheGuestMovie: I think C++ is one of the hardest languages to pick up, so any time you take on someone who has no C++ experience to do C++ work, you're in for a delayed return on investment.

[01:40:06] * BucetaPeluda does them for free already
[01:40:35] <BucetaPeluda> I think your candidates are turning you off because you are not paying them well enough. probably Ubisoft is paying a reasonable salary to them
[01:40:43] <InPhase> TheGuestMovie: What you'll probably find though if you interview them carefully, is that their actual skill level differs from the resume a significant amount in one way or another.  This seems to happen more often than not, with some radical deviations.  Some people are very good at making resumes better than their skill level, and some people are very bad at making them.
[01:41:00] <BucetaPeluda> even zombies need to eat and please their spouses from time to time, you know
[01:42:38] <BucetaPeluda> I almost accepted an offer from Blizzard some years ago. And they are one of the gaming companies that pay better, compared to other ones. But still the other big companies pay better and give more stocks, so... life is short and money is power and happiness... sorry blizzard... sorry my gaming career
[01:42:40] <TheGuestMovie> InPhase: I know, that's why I do the technical interview for C++, and a 5 minute Linux Q&A. For example Chinese immigrants always almost have atrociously-written resumes, you're lucky if they mention the programming language for a project. I still interview just in case. It's all remote nowadays so it's not a huge waste of time. (Plus few
[01:42:41] <TheGuestMovie> applicants in general)

[01:43:43] <BucetaPeluda> an interviewer that loves profiling is definitely someone who I would avoid at all costs
[01:43:56] <Alipha> TheGuestMovie: would you hire someone who lives in the US? heh
[01:44:02] <TheGuestMovie> dude I just said I still interview them because I think they could be good developers despite having badly-written resumes. How is that discriminatory?
[01:44:13] <BucetaPeluda> it's profiling
[01:44:16] <BucetaPeluda> not discriminatory
[01:44:22] <BucetaPeluda> there's a big difference
[01:44:45] <BucetaPeluda> you are trying to avoid discrimination, but the profile / bias is already set
[01:44:56] <TheGuestMovie> I noticed a pattern in the resumes I received, and I don't use it to exclude anyone. I'm fine with calling it profiling, as long as you don't see anything negative in it.
[01:45:10] <BucetaPeluda> there are patterns everywhere
[01:45:12] <TheGuestMovie> you're making more of it than it is

[01:45:47] <BucetaPeluda> btw, I do interviews too :)
[01:45:49] <TheGuestMovie> They have a verbal interview with me where they can clarify the things their bad resume doesnt mention

[06:52:26] <AmR> Any one look at C++ How to Program 10th  ?
[06:53:12] <johnny> what does that mean?
[06:54:40] <AmR> johnny: Did that book is good ?
[06:55:00] <TinoDidriksen> !give AmR basics

[07:00:48] <johnny> AmR, i didn't use any books so far, so i wouldn't know
[07:01:15] <johnny> AmR, what do you want the books to teach you in particular?
[07:01:33] *** Quits: cm007magnum (~Rheanna@218.78.104.50) (Remote host closed the connection)
[07:02:04] <johnny> i suppose i could use a book on how to do templates beyond the basics though. one day i might do more in C++ and thus need them
[07:02:14] <johnny> although perhaps not anytime soon.. we'll see
[07:02:44] <johnny> i spent more time fighting build systems and platform specific apis, and weird little niggles in C++ than problems with actually writing the code
[07:03:40] *** Joins: cm007magnum (~Rheanna@218.78.109.69)
[07:05:24] <AmR> johnny: I have C++ Concurrency in Action by Anthony Williams And  C++ How to Program 10th. So what did you think I can use too or stop one off them or more ?
[07:05:43] <johnny> like i said, i didn't use a book, so i can't say
[07:06:09] *** Joins: ferdna (~ferdna@user/ferdna)
[07:06:27] <johnny> AmR, i asked though specifically what you needed a book for.. what are you trying to do or learn to do that you don't know now
[07:07:07] <johnny> like is it syntax? semantics? build systems? how to perform certain tasks? learning the C++ standard library?
[07:08:26] <johnny> did you hvae previous experience in programming? if so , was it in a lower level language like C? or something higher level like python?
[07:08:45] <johnny> it really helps to know where you are before knowing where you're trying to go
[07:09:12] <AmR> 1st one is OK. 'I think so'. I want know About 2nd to last.
[07:09:24] *** Quits: xkuru (~xkuru@user/xkuru) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[07:09:37] <johnny> well i sai before i didn't use a book
[07:09:52] <AmR> Yes I know C, Not very much. But I can do the job with it.
[07:10:05] <johnny> a lot of people seem to recommend books by scott meyers. that's all i really know
[07:10:27] <AmR> yes, I have previous experience in programming
[07:10:53] <johnny> then maybe you do want to check the guidelines as per the links TinoDidriksen sent you
[07:11:03] <johnny> and then also the scott meyers books
[07:11:25] <AmR> C, VB5, VB6, HTML, CSS, some js, some php, VB.net, some C++.
[07:12:00] <johnny> and then of course browsing a bit through the stdlib via cppreference
[07:12:23] <AmR> OK

[22:07:51] <cbreak> fetch content? :(

[22:13:04] <cbreak> that's the first part of a submodule

[22:14:18] *** Joins: luizfrds (~Luiz@152.250.243.147)
[22:14:27] <cbreak> AmR: then use https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/add_subdirectory.html to add the subdirectory's cmake to your own
[22:15:26] <AmR> This is old part. I try it but not working, And obiwahn help me with it.
[22:15:53] <cbreak> I recommend using submodules, they're the most clean solution
[22:16:01] <cbreak> if you do not want to use them, use ExternalProject
[22:16:09] <cbreak> it can fetch content, and build it too
[22:16:13] <cbreak> all in one
[22:16:24] <AmR> Me too. If the code clean and supported that.
[22:17:06] <AmR> But CMake part in soci is shit.

[22:57:56] <NyB> Guest8783: e.g. do you know what a hash table is and what its performance looks like? Do you know what the complexity of a typical sorting algorithm could be?
[22:58:24] <Guest8783> NyB: yes
[22:59:01] <NyB> ok then. These are the basics, but still useful. Because they are, well, basic :-)
[22:59:34] <Guest8783> Yeah

[22:59:51] <NyB> Guest8783: so the real problem is that you apply for 100 positions, and you get invited to how many interviews?
[23:00:20] <NyB> (and, BTW, I'm assuming your BSc was in computer science)

[23:07:19] <cbreak> is there any point in getting a bachelors degree?
[23:07:38] <cbreak> I think here it's just something you get on the way to a masters degree
[23:08:53] <chris64> I'd say it depends whether you're interested in deep diving in a specific topic or not. In bachelor programmes you get all the basic knowledge you need. Everything else is practice, or?

[23:10:16] <NyB> in a lot of places with less developed software industry, having the right piece of paper can be the only way to even try for some jobs
[23:10:26] <cbreak> I only got a masters degree
[23:10:46] <NyB> I've been working on a PhD for the past 15 years :-p
[23:11:06] <cbreak> hmm... you sure you're not deadlocked? :P
[23:11:21] <LordKalma> are are you phding on?
[23:11:37] *** Joins: luizfrds (~Luiz@152.250.243.147)
[23:11:44] <NyB> oh, I'm making progress. At something-that's-slower-than-a-snail's pace
[23:12:11] <NyB> mostly because I have a rather demamding full-time job
[23:12:25] <cbreak> we have a bunch of PhD students and postdocs working for us, and I think their contracts are all limited to 3 years or so
[23:12:53] <chris64> btw, are you aware of any minimalistic make-like build automation tool? I've seen one like half a year ago and drives me crazy I cannot find it again. It's based on some older concept and reimplemented it
[23:13:28] <chris64> weirdly I remember it's file-based in a way as it touched a file for each target? :-/
[23:13:30] <NyB> there are about 5 billion of them build systems these days...
[23:13:37] <chris64> I know :-|
[23:13:49] <chris64> I believe it was written in c99/c11
[23:13:57] <cbreak> I'd recommend CMake, but it's not minimalistic for sure.
[23:14:02] <NyB> cmake, meson, bazel, make, autotools...
[23:14:15] <chris64> it's much more alternative than those big ones
[23:14:42] <Guest8783> NyB: 0 interviews
[23:14:45] <chris64> my problem is that I'd like to have a build tool that is able to deal with different kinds of input and output files
[23:14:47] <Guest8783> and yes the BSc was in CS
[23:14:50] <chris64> not just c++ source..
[23:15:00] <LordKalma> then cmake :p
[23:15:22] <Guest8783> cbreak: I wanted to continue, I was accepeted to the best master's in CS of my country but I actually need to get money
[23:15:28] <cbreak> why is raw bsd make not good enough for you?
[23:15:32] <cbreak> or gnumake?
[23:15:33] <Guest8783> So I can't continue I really neet to work
[23:15:51] <cbreak> Guest8783: :(
[23:16:06] <NyB> Guest8783: Does that include phone interviews? Don't take this wrong, but I'm thinking there's something wrong with your CV. 0/100 for a BSc graduate on entry level positions... that does not sound right. No matter how saturated the market is.
[23:16:25] <chris64> cbreak: this whole rule/target concept doesn't work for me :-|
[23:16:35] <LordKalma> doing a good cv and having a nice linkedin profile is half the way
[23:16:39] <NyB> Guest8783: which country is this in, if you don't mind sharing?
[23:16:44] <LordKalma> the other half is a push approach
[23:16:46] <Guest8783> NyB: yes also phone interviews
[23:16:47] <LordKalma> I contacted everybody
[23:16:51] <Guest8783> NyB: France
[23:16:53] <cbreak> chris64: that's the best part of make :(
[23:17:02] <cbreak> it's purely declarative, not imperative.
[23:17:06] <cbreak> well... semi-purely
[23:17:37] <LordKalma> cmake is declarative if you do it right and don't have demanding tasks
[23:17:42] <LordKalma> imperative when you need it
[23:17:49] <LordKalma> a trash of a language every time though
[23:18:16] <chris64> cbreak: can a rule have multiple sets of inputs and outputs?
[23:18:33] <cbreak> yes
[23:18:41] <cbreak> I think so
[23:18:50] <chris64> cbreak: do you know a phrase I can search for?
[23:18:53] <cbreak> out0 out1: in0 in1
[23:18:55] <chris64> to get an example

[23:19:15] <chris64> cbreak: how does it know that out1 is of kind a and out0 of kind b?
[23:19:21] <cbreak> I've not used make in a decade or so
[23:19:22] <NyB> Guest8783: I assume you've tried finding example CVs from other people? Or templates? E.g. friends of mine from Germany were saying that the market there is quite anal-retentive about following the proper form in CVs (cover letters... brrr...)
[23:19:34] <cbreak> chris64: does it matter?
[23:19:45] <cbreak> or rather, what do you mean with "kind"?
[23:19:50] <Guest8783> NyB: I made my own template
[23:19:51] <NyB> Guest8783: and that you are not having any technical issues like your mail not working, or whatever?
[23:20:04] <Guest8783> NyB: No issues on this side XDD
[23:20:36] <NyB> Guest8783: uh... making your own template is not necesasarily a good thing. I don't suppose you would share your CV with us?
[23:21:42] <chris64> cbreak: my rule needs commands like this: ./generate --inputa $inA --inputb $inB --output $out
[23:22:06] <chris64> cbreak: if there is no $inB then --inputb must be omitted
[23:22:51] <chris64> cbreak: it would be pretty unreadable if I have a target that just specifies ruleX inA inB: outC
[23:23:44] <Guest8783> NyB: I can I just have to remove my picture and name
[23:24:12] <Guest8783> NyB: I have to translate it in english also

[23:24:27] <Guest8783> NyB: I want you to read the content too
[23:24:34] <Guest8783> Maybe I wrote shit
[23:24:41] <Guest8783> idk what's wrong with me
[23:24:46] <NyB> I can read a bit of french, if I have to
[23:25:06] <Guest8783> I will translate it to show it to more people anyway

[23:58:06] <chris64> cbreak: matching patterns in the dependency's name is good idea
[23:58:50] <chris64> so I could have a suffix that will then lead to the option being prepended
