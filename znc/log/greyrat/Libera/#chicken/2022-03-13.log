[00:01:13] <irontom> Just out of curiositity, in what ways might SICP give one the wrong ideas about how programming works?
[00:03:21] <Lysandros> well, for people that don't have exposure to other programming languages and start learning about algorithms and data structures strictly in scheme they may get very good at algorithms but miss how data can actually be stored and accessed in efficient applications
[00:03:39] <Lysandros> "I'll just put this in a list" just doesn't always fly even if conceptually it may be the same
[00:04:26] <wasamasa> if all you have is lists, then writing a binary tree isn't too bad
[00:06:00] <Lysandros> also the last chapter is very educational as a practical example but it's written in a way that you may think that's something someone would actually code that way
[00:06:51] <Lysandros> I think it lacks a bit of context at times, so a person without a decent idea of how computers work may not understand what they're doing
[00:07:17] <Lysandros> but for learning scheme it's more than fine
[00:09:51] <Corbin> irontom: As an alternative to "The Reasoned Schemer", which teaches Kanren, you might find miniKanren more appealing. There's an interactive tutorial at https://io.livecode.ch/learn/webyrd/webmk and piles of papers at http://minikanren.org/ as well as a CHICKEN egg.
[00:10:52] <Corbin> Oh, sorry, misread "The Seasoned Schemer". Very different.

[07:07:18] *** Joins: irontom (~user@87.249.134.29)

[11:29:59] <wasamasa> s-liao: https://askubuntu.com/questions/744215/searching-previous-command-history-with-pageup-in-14-04
[11:32:16] <s-liao> Thanks
[11:39:50] <s-liao> There is not the .inputrc file in the folder /root.
[11:40:01] <wasamasa> lol
[11:40:08] <wasamasa> create one, I dare you
[11:40:29] <wasamasa> or bind the keys with breadline procedures
[11:41:15] <s-liao> Yes. I just did it.
[11:41:42] <wasamasa> though, no, breadline doesn't expose that yet
[11:42:38] <s-liao> But the only different is that the "[A" string is added in the different position in the popping up the line buffer
[11:43:08] <wasamasa> you will need to do the cat thing yourself to find out the correct binding
[11:43:57] <s-liao> Yes. I have not found out there is the function in the scm file to bind key yet
[11:44:11] <wasamasa> you cannot just blindly copy other people's code and expect it to work
[11:44:23] <s-liao> How can I do that cat things.
[11:44:34] <wasamasa> dude
[11:44:36] <wasamasa> > To test what a key is, run cat and then press the key:
[11:47:43] <s-liao> it add the [A. that cat PgUp, it is ^[[A
[11:48:01] <s-liao> is that Okay
[11:50:05] <wasamasa> only you can know that :P
[11:50:25] <s-liao> Okay
[11:51:38] *** Joins: crumpo (~crumpo@user/crumpo)
[11:51:57] <wasamasa> so, your $HOME is /root?
[11:52:10] <wasamasa> what does your ~/.inputrc contain?
[11:53:14] <s-liao> Yes.
[11:53:31] <s-liao> echo $HOME -> /root
[11:57:03] <s-liao> I changed the key bind in the /etc/.inputrc, like '#"\e[5~": history-search-backward', there is no behavior changed in bash
[11:57:17] <wasamasa> well
[11:57:20] <wasamasa> this cannot work for several reasons
[11:57:22] <wasamasa> why the '#
[11:57:41] <wasamasa> why \e[5~ when you say cat gives you ^[[A
[11:58:20] <wasamasa> you need to actually understand what these answers tell you instead of blindly copying them
[11:58:24] <s-liao> Okay
[12:01:56] <wasamasa> "\e[A": history-search-backward
[12:02:53] <s-liao> Same. I guest that it is hard code in bash in my side. Whatever add or remove, the same behavior.
[12:03:06] <wasamasa> "\e[A": "pageup"
[12:03:29] <wasamasa> in my case, page up corresponds to ^[[5~ instead of ^[[A
[12:03:44] <wasamasa> therefore I tested with "\e[5~": "pageup"
[12:03:54] <wasamasa> which types these letters
[12:04:01] <s-liao> Okay
[12:04:36] <wasamasa> besides
[12:04:40] <wasamasa> why are you talking about bash
[12:04:45] <wasamasa> I thought this was about breadline
[12:08:48] <s-liao> I thought Ctrl + r with  the configuration "\e[A": history-search-backward
[12:09:01] <s-liao> in bash
[12:09:35] <wasamasa> you need to learn to debug this properly
[12:09:56] <wasamasa> your ~/.initrc should only contain "\e[A": "pageup"
[12:10:17] <wasamasa> then you open some application using readline (like csi with breadline)
[12:10:24] <wasamasa> then you press the page up key
[12:10:28] <wasamasa> no C-r or anything else
[12:10:35] <s-liao> Okay
[12:12:00] <s-liao> Yes, it is.
[12:13:23] <s-liao> I mean that in the csi,  with that configuration, when press "page up" key, it pops up the string pageup
[12:17:28] <s-liao> But what I was saying is that the current line to run history-search-backward.
[12:18:05] <s-liao> After Ctrl+R, go the the current line, then run history-search-backward.
[12:18:34] <wasamasa> so it does work after all
[12:19:08] <s-liao> Not yet. still same.
[12:19:53] <wasamasa> history-search-backward is just one possible example for a command to bind to the page up key
[12:20:06] <wasamasa> so is the "pageup" macro
[12:20:15] <wasamasa> I don't care what you end up binding to the page up key
[12:20:22] <wasamasa> you've proven you can bind anything you want to it
[12:20:24] <wasamasa> so I'm out
[12:20:31] <wasamasa> go figure out yourself what you want it to do
[12:23:17] <s-liao> Give me one more mintues
[12:25:33] <s-liao> Most likely it is an issue in my side.
[12:28:14] <s-liao> After press Ctrl+r, the bind is missing. I mean that press "Page up" is no long binding to "pageup", which I configured in the .inputrc file.
[12:33:42] <s-liao> Then it is an invisible character, then press "Enter", it shows up "[A"
[12:34:46] <s-liao> But it works in bash
[12:36:07] <s-liao> I mean that after press Ctrl+r, then press "Page up" still bind to "pageup". it shows up the "pageup"
[12:38:44] <wasamasa> in any case
[12:38:48] <wasamasa> unrelated to breadline
[12:39:18] <wasamasa> I cannot reproduce your issue at all, might as well be a putty problem or whatever
[12:46:33] <vandusen> SPAM! SPAM! SPAM! by scoreplace
[12:46:36] <wasamasa> lol
[13:06:41] <s-liao> I tried inside the VM. it is same.
[13:08:46] <s-liao> But the second time press "page up" in csi ,that binding the "pageup" come out.after Ctrl + r
[13:09:18] <s-liao> Quite interesting.

[17:53:35] <elflng> im alive and semi-functional!

[18:29:31] <wasamasa> elflng: you need to debug the engrish first, then readline issues on windows with putty
[18:29:34] <wasamasa> elflng: good luck
[18:30:23] <wasamasa> elflng: s-liao wants to have the key sequence of C-r followed by page up to do something useful rather than printing control characters and not even binding the key sequence in question does behave consistently
[18:30:35] <wasamasa> elflng: except we cannot know because of the engrish
[18:31:41] <wasamasa> elflng: the only reason I even get this nonsense here is because I wrote a readline binding
[18:40:01] <elflng> ah.
[18:40:26] <elflng> readline with putty is a bit of a ... whats the word in english... balagan is the word im used to.
[18:41:09] <elflng> its not going to work in putty in windows. 
[18:41:15] <elflng> unless. ... one sec.
[18:43:24] <elflng> yeah, theres no way to do it, i think. both windows and putty translate out control-sequences ahead of time and dont allow passthrough
[18:44:00] <elflng> (i was checking if putty allows passthrough. it used to allow passthrough of certain sequences but does not any more, or at least not from the standard config)
[18:46:54] <elflng> https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/139744/how-to-enable-control-key-combinations-for-gnu-screen-on-putty
[18:47:57] <elflng> so theoretically it can be done with a bit of work, to figure out what the keys are actually mapping to, and then using something like screen (which can do resequencing) to get it to do what you want.
[18:48:19] <elflng> which i think is a pretty hideous thing to do and isnt related to readline or chicken per se
[18:48:27] <jcowan> Oh, it's ugly, and when X is involved it gets even worse.
[18:48:38] <elflng> if the readline binding allows redefinition, you may be able to use that..
[18:48:52] <elflng> but again, its pretty hideous. solution: use wsl or something else :)
[18:49:44] <elflng> btw, if no-one else has posted this yet, chicken 5.2 with wsl works like a charm, no modification needed for a straight linux build
[18:53:48] <wasamasa> it doesn't expose key bindings, so .inputrc it is
