[00:41:31] <dimadima> i haven't done any aggregations but just watching logs, it's probably near 50%

[00:43:43] <dimadima> tanzania, where you can get clicks for $0.05-0.07, ios is highly prevalent

[03:12:59] <dimadima> twitter font finally grew on me
[03:50:38] <imode> put my money where my mouth is recently. peanut butter and pickled onion sandwich.
[03:50:48] <imode> saw someone on youtube proclaim they eat it often.
[03:50:56] <imode> and it's... not _bad_.
[03:51:15] <imode> I feel like you could do peanut butter noodles with some fried garlic and top it with pickled red onions and that'd be a treat.
[03:59:44] <dimadima> woah. you really had me tripping until that peanut butter noodle comparison grounded me
[04:00:43] <dimadima> did someone present this to you as a personal favorite or passable food or something in between?
[04:01:05] <imode> personal favorite apparently.
[04:01:27] <imode> god I put some lemon garlic mayo on the onions and my BRAIN IS FUCKED.
[04:01:33] <imode> how does this WORK.
[04:10:37] <dimadima> how _does_ that work? why wold lemon garlic mayo fuck your brain
[04:11:34] <imode> because it's peanut butter, lemon garlic mayo, pickled red onions on a potato bun.
[04:11:54] <imode> and it's not bad. I wouldn't eat this every day, but I could see how someone could eat it frequently.
[04:13:25] <dimadima> did you snort it
[04:13:38] <dimadima> :)
[04:13:43] <dimadima> mmm potato bun
[04:14:52] <dimadima> oh you meant it, like, figuratively
[04:15:08] <dimadima> i thought this food threw off your cognition somehow
[04:15:22] <dimadima> it's possible, you know, all that shit revolves around the gut they say

[04:22:03] <dimadima> that is so far out

[04:22:22] <dimadima> the onions
[04:22:31] <imode> yup.
[04:22:54] <dimadima> the peanut noodles thing is the only thing that's anchoring this for me. i love peanut noodles
[04:23:13] <dimadima> why is it so wierd as a sandwich though
[04:23:45] * imode shrugs.
[04:24:07] <defect> pickled red onions is the best. i also try to keep some dill pickles in my fridge but i keep snacking on them
[04:24:26] <imode> claussen pickles are worth their weight in gold.
[04:25:00] <defect> i've been making my own recently
[04:25:33] <defect> not sure if they're better, but at least i get a sense of accomplishment :P
[04:26:25] <imode> that's awesome, do you have a particular recipe?
[04:27:49] <defect> not really. two cups water, two cups vinegar and a bit of sugar for the liquid. then i just stuffed dill, black peppercorns, garlic and some jalapeno in a jar with the cucumbers
[04:28:10] <defect> and poured the pickling liquid in to the thing

[22:08:04] <Brekkjern> Hahahaha
[22:08:47] <gwozniak> uh... what? :)
[22:08:59] <gwozniak> That's one wacky argument
[22:09:10] <Brekkjern> Yeah
[22:09:19] <Geekingfrog> lolwat
[22:09:38] <Brekkjern> I mean... Speedrunning requires an absurd amount of dedication and work ethics, and for absolutely zero fucking payoff :P
[22:15:00] <bontaq> honestly a classic tweet
[22:15:14] <Brekkjern> It's the response that makes it for me though :P
[22:15:24] <dimadima> thanks Brekkjern. lol just noticed a status bar appears at some point with `https://192.168.150` but that's life... next time!
[22:15:39] <Brekkjern> dimadima: Shit happens :P
[22:16:01] <dimadima> waht is speedrunning
[22:16:11] <Brekkjern> You could just edit out the bottom of the screen though?
[22:16:41] <Brekkjern> dimadima: Speedrunning is to try to finish games as quickly as possible, often using glitches and other exploits in the game to do so.
[22:16:55] <dimadima> actually i think i can edit that out pretty easily. i will try
[22:17:01] <dimadima> ohhhh yeah i've seen those videos
[22:17:09] <dimadima> lol what does the radical left have anything to do with that
[22:17:32] <Brekkjern> Do not try to make sense of it. It will just hurt
[22:17:34] <dimadima> 1/14
[22:17:35] <dimadima> kill me
[22:17:44] <dimadima> "Petersonian"
[22:17:59] <imode> Brekkjern: racing has absolutely zero fucking payoff.
[22:18:00] <Geekingfrog> what does that even mean ?
[22:18:07] <dimadima> i have no idea!
[22:18:19] <dimadima> imode: you must not be a radical leftist
[22:19:21] <imode> competetive programming has zero payoff by extension.
[22:19:25] <dimadima> i also must not be because why those videos are kind of interesting i've never related to them
[22:20:09] <imode> speedrunning is neat. obscene amounts of efforts are put in. I like the scene because it motivates videogame preservation and lots of tooling around particular games.
[22:20:10] <dimadima> s/why/while
[22:20:23] <dimadima> yeah
[22:21:01] <imode> metroid prime speedruns are particularly nice because that entire scene basically led to a full native port of prime to PC.
[22:21:02] <dimadima> "alternative sexual archtypes"
[22:21:09] <dimadima> the tweet that keeps on killing
[22:22:07] <imode> I have a hard time believing that tweet is real lmao.
[22:22:14] <imode> the dude has a mass effect avatar.
[22:22:39] <dimadima> that would be preferable
[22:23:22] <dimadima> he pulls off a solid john birch society tone in the text otherwise though
[22:28:42] <imode> "petersonian" is a reference to john peterson.
[22:31:23] <gwozniak> Might as well be Norm Peterson: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norm_Peterson

[22:40:05] <imode> drakonis: yeeeeeeeesssssir.
[22:40:23] <imode> dimadima: my bad, it's jordan peterson.
[22:40:40] <imode> not john peterson. shows how much I care about that.

[22:41:04] <drakonis> yeeeeeeeeeee
[22:41:13] <drakonis> inject this shit straight into my eyelids
[22:41:26] <imode> been following that since antidote started it.
[22:42:40] <drakonis> i want a mod that improves metroid prime to a level where it is suitably hard for a mouse and keyboard scheme
[22:42:47] <drakonis> as it is too easy with it
[22:44:42] <imode> I imagine as soon as Metaforce gets off the ground and becomes more popular like the SM64 decomp, it'll get there.
[22:45:49] <drakonis> how's the sm64 decomp going anyways?
[22:46:05] <imode> I dunno! haven't checked it out recently.
[22:46:18] <imode> I think it's finished.
[22:46:21] <drakonis> i want to see if they added a ton of mods

[22:47:13] <buttsbot> chromatic_megafauna comments on [IRC/Freenode] "This is not a hostile takeover", says Andrew, as he takes over hostile-ly
[22:49:29] <imode> oh no.
[22:49:55] <imode> we've been spotted.
[22:52:22] <Church> If I can find the internet historians email I still wanna see if they'll cover it
[22:57:12] <dimadima> people are still talking about freenode/libera
[22:57:12] <buttsbot> Iâ€™d just like to interject for a moment. What youâ€™re referring to as Freenode, is in fact Leenode, or as Iâ€™ve recently taken to calling it, Andrew Lee plus IRC. Freenode is not an IRC network unto itself, but rather another bastion of Andrew Leeâ€™s princedom.
[22:57:20] <dimadima> isn't that over?
[22:57:32] <imode> oh my god.
[22:57:34] <imode> freenode.
[22:57:47] <imode> awwww. that must be a random incident.
[22:57:51] <Church> I should make a alt to chime in there
[22:58:05] <Church> No way I'm linking my reddit account to me
[22:58:06] <imode> dimadima: for all intents and purposes, it's over.
[22:58:13] <dimadima> imode: this guy? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Peterson
[22:58:13] <buttsbot> Jordan Peterson - Wikipedia
[22:58:24] <imode> yeah that fuck.
[22:58:34] <dimadima> was just surprised to see the reddit topic, then
[22:58:50] <dimadima> imode: what is his deal
[22:59:12] <imode> bullshit, pretty much.
[22:59:21] <dimadima> 12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos (2018)
[22:59:24] <bontaq> idk, he told men to wipe their asses, gained a cult, and went insane
[22:59:39] <dimadima> so he's like "don't be a schlub!"?
[22:59:44] <imode> ..wipe their asses?
[22:59:46] <imode> I need context.
[23:00:08] <imode> dimadima: he's a schlub drug addict conservative nutcase.
[23:00:26] <dimadima> what's his drugs
[23:00:29] <imode> benzos.
[23:00:36] <dimadima> really lol
[23:00:40] <imode> yep.
[23:00:45] <dimadima> that's so old school
[23:00:51] <dimadima> no?
[23:00:57] <imode> it's hip now.
[23:01:14] <dimadima> never done benzos
[23:01:18] <bontaq> yeah pretty much "don't be a schlub" but blew up and followers think he & they are some sort of last-real-men-on-earth deal
[23:01:31] <dimadima> lol oh no :(
[23:01:40] <dimadima> those guys!
[23:01:58] <dimadima> okay thanks bontaq
[23:02:11] * dimadima tucks his button down into his bootcut jeans 
[23:02:33] <dimadima> let
[23:02:35] <dimadima> 's fuck
[23:02:43] <dimadima> okay sorry i'm done
[23:02:50] <bontaq> his book features chapters like "Stand up straight with your shoulders back" and "Set your house in perfect order before you criticize the world"
[23:03:49] <imode> how revolutionary.
[23:04:39] <deadk> he's pretty incoherent
[23:05:11] <deadk> he has a way of babbling where if you don't catch yourself you think you don't understand it because it's too clever for you, but actually you don't understand it because it doesn't mean anything at all
[23:05:37] <imode> I think that's by design. he's a distortionist mirror. people project things on to him, and he projects things back to them.
[23:05:59] <imode> that's an art for conmen.
[23:11:45] <Church> dimadima: Yeah benzos are huge now
[23:11:47] <Church> Sadly
[23:12:38] <dimadima> good conmen are amazing
[23:12:43] <dimadima> Church: how come
[23:12:52] <dimadima> do they ruin ppls lives
[23:12:59] <imode> yep.
[23:13:07] <dimadima> what's the effect?
[23:13:13] <dimadima> relaxation?
[23:13:30] <imode> they are depressants, so.
[23:13:41] <dimadima> hmm
[23:13:49] <dimadima> benzos. weird. had no idea
[23:16:30] <dimadima> so was this guy all high and mighty and then get outed for being drug dependent?
[23:16:41] <dimadima> one of those cats?
[23:16:56] * imode shrugs.
[23:18:27] <dimadima> i know i could just find this out on wikipdia but
[23:18:35] <dimadima> chatting is more pleasant
[23:18:41] <dimadima> and i don't actually care
[23:18:50] <dimadima> like enough to read about him
[23:18:53] <dimadima> sounds pretty miserable
[23:27:49] <bontaq> yeah, drug dependent and sent to rehab
[23:28:09] <bontaq> I think they're around again but obv a lot of the hype died down after that
[23:39:22] <gerikson> his daughter shipped him to Russia and had him put into a coma to go cold turkey IIRC
[23:44:07] <riv> the whole steak only thing is sus isnt it?
[23:44:25] <riv> him and his daughter both think they have some extreme allergy? where they can't eat vegetables
[23:45:01] <riv> im glad 'gluten sensitive' stopped being trendy
[23:45:11] <riv> adhd seems to be the new fad though
[23:45:21] <wrl> ... new?
[23:46:05] <wrl> tbqh though people have been pooh-poohing adhd diagnoses since the 90s and it's kind of old hat now
[23:46:19] <wrl> makes it difficult for those of us struggling with it to get decent treatment
