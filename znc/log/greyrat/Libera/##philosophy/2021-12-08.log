[06:32:14] <biys> this Hellbound flick is so cringe but so based
[06:32:56] <biys> some face appears in the sky and tells you you're bound to hell at such a point in time.  few days, few weeks, months, years
[06:33:10] <biys> it's taken as a sign from God that people ought to live more righteous lives
[06:33:24] <biys> so once peopel are condemned they're kind of expected to, eventually, go on TV and confess their "sins"
[06:33:56] <biys> your being bound to hell means three ghost like black objects appear and offer you a shit kicking, then burn your body to a crisp
[06:34:22] <biys> i laugh because i was recently thinking about value structures void of consequence, and how they're essentially meaningless

[07:23:10] <audrey> For Dostoyevsky, the consequent (everything is allowed) was too horrible to accept as true, hence the necessity of negating the antecedent (it is not true that god does not exist - i.e. god does exist).

[07:26:07] <audrey> This is similar to the arguments for the existence of a deity posited by various Christian theologians - even Kant, who had to admit that without a ¨kingdom of ends¨, there was no reason to actually lead a moral life or even care about the categorical imperative.
[07:27:04] <audrey> For me, the more parsimonious thing to do is throw up my hands and accept that the human project of morality will always be built on sand, and there isn´t really any justice in the cosmos beyond human retribution.

[07:38:10] <darklambda> perhaps, without moot, people can agree
[07:41:17] <audrey> The other way you could go is to say something like - «well maybe there is no god and no afterlife but we all have to pretend there is in order not to collapse into chaos» - which seems to be the position taken by people like JP
[07:41:42] <audrey> Doesn´t seem particularly honest, though, to me.
[07:42:01] <darklambda> well... some people might have that as a better choice.. acting out a role to survice in a certain community
[07:42:15] <audrey> I´d rather be under no illusions, even if the reality kills me.
[07:42:16] <darklambda> s/survice/survive
[07:42:16] <ro-bot-o> darklambda meant to say: well... some people might have that as a better choice.. acting out a role to survive in a certain community
[07:43:02] <darklambda> self preservation might pay in a long run... like when someone get an opportunity to leave that community in the future
[07:43:04] <audrey> On a personal level, I´ve found that a healthy dose of nihilism has made me much less stressed.
[07:43:34] <audrey> There are lots of things that I used to obsess over, that I don´t. It´s kind of freeing, as long as you don´t let the freedom turn to self-destruction.
[07:44:39] <darklambda> what were stuff you used to obsessed over?
[07:45:02] <darklambda> i used to obsessed with yoyos as a kid.. now not so much.. got replaced by guitar pedals... hahaha
[07:46:58] <audrey> darklambda: Meaning of Life (TM), god, afterlife, filial piety, plus the usual adolescent petty neuroses
[07:47:16] <darklambda> ah
[07:47:25] <darklambda> makes sense
[07:47:28] <audrey> Unfortunately most of those lasted into my early-mid twenties
[07:47:33] <audrey> and kind of ruined my adolescence
[07:47:45] <audrey> I think I´ve finally kicked the depression, at least.
[07:47:48] <darklambda> well.. can't briing back time now
[07:47:59] <audrey> The really debilitating sort, anyway. I´ll always have a melancholy personality.
[07:48:54] <darklambda> at some point in life (thankful that i came to know about it early).. i view things in circles.. like circle of concern and circle of control/influence
[07:49:01] <audrey> darklambda: I think I can relate! But replace guitar pedals with an 88-key keyboard.
[07:49:43] <darklambda> and usually i try to spend time more on the circle of control/influence... since time is scarce... might as well spend those on stuff i have more effect on
[07:49:46] <darklambda> hehe
[07:50:01] <audrey> Anyway, I operate under a principle of what you might call limited morality. I don´t eat food that necessitates the slaughter of an animal and I don´t have kids - because I don´t want to contribute to the sum of suffering in the universe more than I have to.
[07:50:17] <audrey> But I´ve long given up trying to justify any of these opinions in any grand cosmic sense.
[07:50:44] <darklambda> ah 88 keyboard... i only got until 61.. but it's portable and comes with bag... though nowadays, i'm ok with nanokey2 25keys for laptop music prod stuff
[07:51:13] <audrey> Yeah, I have a lot of classical repertoire so 88 keys is a must. but sometimes it´s cool to plug it into MIDI and use it as a synth
[07:51:19] <audrey> and throw Mozart out the window :D
[07:51:20] <darklambda> ah
[07:52:13] <darklambda> nice... i would want 88 if i have space.. hehe
[07:52:58] <darklambda> i got my 61key from someone who wanted to upgradee to 88
[07:54:04] <audrey> someday when I own my own place I will buy a proper acoustic piano
[07:54:51] <darklambda> grand? :-)
[07:57:23] <audrey> Well, if I have the money!
[07:57:41] <audrey> I used to study piano at university and was spoiled by the 6-foot Baldwins they had in the practice rooms
[07:57:48] <darklambda> oooooh
[07:58:20] <audrey> I have some really good recordings from that time - I got to use the practice recital hall when it wasn´t in use
[07:58:26] <audrey> Good instrument, good acoustics
[07:59:10] <audrey> That piano in particular had such wonderful personality, it was as good as a lot of full sized 9-footers
[07:59:20] <darklambda> perhaps can capture samples of that instrument.. can can  play on your keyboard with the same sounds..
[07:59:40] <audrey> My electric piano has weighted keys to simulate a grand piano
[07:59:51] <audrey> So that when I practice, my finger technique is the same
[08:00:06] <audrey> But obviously the sound isn´t quite so good (though acceptable for practice purposes)
[08:00:44] <darklambda> i like the thin piano keys... i used to do manual hand tremolo on them
[08:00:46] <darklambda> hehe
[08:01:12] <audrey> There was also a small organ at my alma mater
[08:01:17] <audrey> I miss that too :(
[08:01:38] <darklambda> sound samples might help improve the sound... but not that great perhaps for insta.... grand looks great for the gram :-)
[08:01:50] <audrey> Well, I´m not too concerned about Instagram lol
[08:01:54] <darklambda> lol
[08:02:02] <audrey> I used to have my recordings up on YouTube but I took them down

[10:00:00] <amigojapan> omero: I bought a couple of imported bean cans from Italy
[10:03:11] <omero> you could make a good 'minestrone' with them... if you mix various kind of beans and other vegs... including mushrooms (if you like those)
[10:04:27] <omero> a minestrone is a dense soup... a mix of green stuff... good to eat along with stale home bread

[15:41:53] <brigand> also for public saunas, right?
[15:42:43] <arryana> alcohol and heat isn't a mix that works well for me, but more power to you

[15:46:18] <pussipupu> I'm not sure about public sauna, I just our home one
[15:53:08] <pussipupu> alcohol comes after sauna for me, during the cool down
[15:55:26] <brigand> i'm just asking cause it was a topic in another room. in germany it's also normal to go naked into the sauna. just take a towel where you sit

[18:12:38] <audrey> Western (and Northern) Europeans have *gasp* Continental views toward nudity and sexuality
[18:13:02] <audrey> IDK, in Russia the sauna/banya is mostly a male thing
[18:14:09] <audrey> Well, East Europeans are still less uptight about nudity than e.g. British people or Americans
[18:14:32] <arryana> yeah, i don't get that
[18:14:43] <arryana> it's childish to be shocked by casual nudity
[18:15:06] <audrey> But nudity (and public affection, more generally) are distinct in East European cultures
[18:15:29] <audrey> For example, a man kissing another man on the cheek would be considered homosexual in the West but perfectly normal in Russia.
[18:15:38] <audrey> Same for two women holding hands.
[18:16:01] <arryana> yeah, i don't get that either
[18:16:31] <audrey> meanwhile in Sweden "anything goes" lol
[18:16:55] <brigand> yet it's considered more dangerous for homosexuals in russia/eastern europe
[18:17:49] <audrey> You can get away with it in the big cities. The problem is if you go out to the boonies and/or extremely hostile places like Chechnya (not recommend for anyone even if you're straight).
[18:18:05] <audrey> Muscovites have seen it all and mostly don't care.
[18:18:08] <brigand> oh, i see
[18:18:25] <brigand> can also be dangerous in the deep south of usa i guess
[18:20:14] <pussipupu> One shouldn't be naked outside for long in this weather
[18:20:31] <audrey> Heh. I remember going to Alabama with the ex and being vaguely aware that we shouldn't be holding hands
[18:20:32] <brigand> o:
[18:20:57] <audrey> We did smooch once in a restaurant (really just a peck on the cheek) and immediately got reprimanded by her father
[18:21:18] <audrey> Apparently the entire table next to us was scandalized
[18:21:20] <brigand> damn
[18:21:41] <audrey> Also, I got introduced everywhere as "[name]'s friend"
[18:21:48] <brigand> did they get out their holy water and crucifixes?
[18:21:49] <audrey> I thought it was kind of funny
[18:22:28] <audrey> Then again, two homosexual women are seen as less threatening than two homosexual men
[18:23:15] <audrey> Just compare the number of (non-pornographic) movies with lesbian sex scenes in them, to the number with gay male sex scenes in them.
[18:23:35] <audrey> American society is fine with the former because women are already sexualised, but the latter is rare.
[18:23:40] <brigand> i think that's more because men like to watch lesbians xD
[18:23:45] <brigand> *some men
[18:23:54] <brigand> right
[18:24:08] <audrey> Most lesbian sex scenes are terribly unrealistic and it's clear that a man is directing them. But that's another conversation. :P
[18:24:51] <brigand> nods
[18:25:44] <arryana> too true
[18:27:17] <audrey> (Aaand, the Most Unrealistic Lesbian Depiction in the Movies Award goes to: Blue is the Warmest Color. *gets out puke bag*)

[18:30:55] <Atque> audrey: There's cross-cultural examples too. For example, several Islamic countries condemn homosexual men, but not homosexual women.
[18:30:57] <audrey> I figured every warm-blooded straight man west of the Iron Curtain has already watched the movie and there's nothing to spoil

[18:32:18] <audrey> Atque: Yep. Or historically, male homosexual acts were strictly penalized under Victorian British law, but not female homosexual acts.
[18:32:29] <audrey> Male homosexuality is generally perceived as more threatening.
[18:33:07] <brigand> never heard of the movie
[18:33:20] <brigand> oh, french
[18:33:31] <audrey> Yes, French, what do you expect :D
[18:33:48] <audrey> Only they (and perhaps the Swedes) could make a movie like this.
[18:34:57] <audrey> I remember when I visited Scandinavia once in the late 2000s and was moderately surprised to see nudity on public television
[18:35:15] <audrey> my mother, whom I was travelling with at the time (I was young) was properly scandalized
[18:35:29] <brigand> imdb and rottentomatoes say it's watch-worthy
[18:35:45] <audrey> brigand: It's not a bad film, but the sexual excess ruins it for me
[18:36:00] <brigand> oh, i see
[18:36:10] <brigand> now i have to watch xD
[18:36:43] <audrey> I liked Last Tango in Paris but the director (Bertolucci) had the good sense to keep the sex scenes short
[18:37:27] <audrey> even though it's (very) explicit ... also Marlon Brando is one of my favorite actors so he gets a pass
[18:38:16] <brigand> you must have an eye for it. i like sex but i can't come up with a single sex scene that i would describe as good or bad
[18:40:19] <audrey> What's the expression? For men, sex is a fast food meal; for women it's a five-course menu with wine on the rocks...
[18:41:09] <brigand> must be a russian expression :p
[18:41:18] <audrey> No, actually I just made it up on the spot.
[18:41:29] <audrey> But it sounded like something a Westerner would say.

[19:59:48] <audrey> I'm not really a Bible person but I did like the parable about the workers in the vineyard. Why did the workers who toiled all day get paid the same as those who worked for only an hour? Well, my answer (which is not the dogmatically correct answer, but whatever) is that nobody deserved anything.
[19:59:57] <audrey> And the story just illustrates the unfairness of life.
[20:00:15] <arryana> yep
[20:01:04] <audrey> I've mentioned this in ##religion but I would highly recommend the Jefferson Bible to anyone who wants to read the parables and moral teachings in the New Testament without all the talk of supernatural miracles and theologizing.

[21:53:07] <Ungwelian> Class consciousness is imo understanding these long-term differences in freedom.
[21:53:19] <I_Am_M00t> critical class theory!
[21:53:19] <Ungwelian> The privileges pile up.
[21:53:27] <Ungwelian> Deprivation piles up too.

[21:55:24] <Ungwelian> Nowadays in Finland, we have e.g. young mental health patients who sleep in hospital corridors.
[21:55:41] <Ungwelian> The corridors aren't meant for sleeping.
[21:56:00] <Ungwelian> But there's no other place. Many of them are kicked out, to make room for other people.
[21:56:10] <Ungwelian> So you have a sort of temporary respite circulation.
[21:56:53] <Ungwelian> It's an example of behaviour and deprivation that the well-offs never have to concern themselves with.

[22:02:54] <Delf> atheism is propaganda for the poor?
[22:04:12] <biys> hah.  audrey have you ever read "the lottery"?
[22:04:16] <biys> lemme find a link for you quick

[22:04:39] <ro-bot-o> [url] “The Lottery,” by Shirley Jackson | The New Yorker | www.newyorker.com
[22:05:02] <biys> it's your quinetessential look at sacrifice for the greater good
[22:05:07] <biys> or supposed anyways
[22:05:29] <biys> :s/greater good/supposed greater good/
[22:06:10] <biys> but IIRC sam harris and JP did a "discussion" where they talked about Rodion Raskolnikov
[22:06:31] <biys> and JP made the position that those void of the judeo-christian value structure would essentially BE Rodion
[22:06:52] <biys> he seemed shocked at his own proposition as well
[22:06:54] <biys> i
[22:07:12] <biys> m gonna try and find the exact time and space to watch it again to see if my recollection is accurate
[22:07:30] <audrey> So is the suggestion that we should believe in falsehoods in order to prote4ct ourselves from becoming Raskolnikows?
[22:07:52] <biys> more or less.  "you can't throw the baby out with the bath water" is kind of what he always says
[22:08:13] <audrey> I don't understand what the existential terror is all about, personally. I lead my life more or less the same regardless of whether there is some absolute source of morality or not.
[22:08:21] <audrey> As banal as this sounds, it doesn't really affect my life.
[22:08:50] <biys> there are limitations to y our actions that are as a result of the construct
[22:09:17] <audrey> If I was suddenly assured that there was no morality and no god and no afterlife, I don't think I would become an axe murderer.
[22:09:34] <audrey> This seems to expose a mistake in how one understands the nature of human behavior.
[22:09:58] <biys> i think people are born tabula rasa.  the inherent idea of decency doesn't exist
[22:10:04] <biys> it's a matter of...  intersectionality

[22:10:17] <audrey> There seem to be some more or less universal taboos. Coprophagy, pedophilia.
[22:10:31] <biys> idk about ``universal'' persay
[22:10:47] <audrey> But you can explain those in evolutionary terms, not moral ones.
[22:11:04] <biys> gotta be careful with that though
[22:11:11] <audrey> I am surprised people like JP don't talk more about evolution being the source of rudimentary morality, more than fantastical Judeo-Christian myths.
[22:11:17] <biys> cause you're essentially comdemning people based on a biological precondition
[22:11:46] <audrey> Well, there are people sexually aroused by ingesting excrement, sure; but it's not conducive to evolutionary survival.

[22:12:12] <audrey> Aw, sad, just as this conversation was getting rolling :(
[22:12:25] <biys> we have all the time in the world at our disposal
[22:13:37] <audrey> To clarify, I don't endorse trying to make normative claims about how people ought to act based on evolutionary advantageousness
[22:13:53] <audrey> But it's often useful as a descriptive mechanism, for why people have the moral beliefs they have.
[22:15:03] <audrey> This might also be related to the revulsion to homosexuality/sodomy found in a lot of pre-industrial societies. I'm sure someone has written about this somewhere.

[22:19:44] <I_Am_M00t> JP is a schmuck, i don't have much to add there
[22:21:03] <audrey> I'm pretty neutral on JP. He's very polarizing, I don't find him all that profound, though he has a knack for pointing out difficult topics that tend to get overlooked in discussions surrounding ethics/morality.

[22:22:14] <audrey> But not a very convincing one.
