[00:18:30] <alzgh> hope this is not a stupid question. using `git commit` is there a switch that also adds files that still aren't added to git's index?
[00:18:59] <imMute> alzgh: there's -a which commits *everything*, but that one should probably be avoided
[00:19:39] <alzgh> -a does stage files that have been added to git's index previously. it does not add untracked files.
[00:20:59] <imMute> so you want to stage/commit everything, including untracked files?
[00:21:14] <alzgh> yes, if possible

[04:08:01] <pcarphin> I'm writing a script that is going to do something for each branch in a repo.   I've always done the equivalent of branches=$(git branch | tr '*' ' ') to remove the star but today feels like a good day to ask if there is a more elegant way.  I don't want to remove the star through string manipulation.
[04:10:19] <pcarphin> alzgh always run git status after `git add .`, it's easy to get surprised.
[04:12:10] <pcarphin> (you can do `git add . --dry-run` but I just do `git add . ; git status` and `git reset FILE` to unstage things that maybe I didn't want added.

[07:28:02] <Kill-Animals> for example, I have forked from https://github.com/andmarti1424/sc-im/ and now I want to add him.

[11:38:01] <Kill-Animals> Why exactly is git tag important? Aren't versions already tracked with commit messages?
[11:38:55] <cbreak> Kill-Animals: tags are labels in history
[11:39:07] <cbreak> they are not part of history, and can therefore be added without rewriting it
[11:39:43] <cbreak> tags are not really just for "versions", they are for general labeling of git objects
[11:40:07] <Kill-Animals> cbreak: okay. What is a reason you specifically use tag, just so I can get an idea of how its used?
[11:40:18] *** Parts: pabs3 (~pabs3@user/pabs3) (Don't rest until the streets are paved in poems.)
[11:40:21] <cbreak> for example to tag releases, to tag commits because of suspicion of bugs, to tag a branch as backup before rewriting history
[11:40:46] <ikke> note that git has 2 flavors of tags
[11:40:55] <cbreak> the lean ones and the fatty ones
[11:40:57] <Kill-Animals> i'm at that point in the tutorial
[11:40:58] <ikke> lightweight tags (just a label), and annotated tags
[11:41:13] <cbreak> I only use lightweight tags
[11:41:29] <ikke> some features in git work only with annotated tags by default
[11:41:29] <cbreak> annotated ones allow signing, which is nice for proper releases
[11:41:37] <cbreak> and you get to write a message
[11:41:47] <Kill-Animals> lightweight tags don't have messages though? So whats the point?
[11:42:16] <mackerman> Lightweight tags are branches that don't advance.
[11:42:25] <ikke> "Annotated tags are meant for release while lightweight tags are meant for private or temporary object labels."

[11:42:27] <gitinfo> the git-tag manpage is available at https://gitirc.eu/git-tag.html

[11:43:24] <Kill-Animals> mackerman: ikke: See, it sounds to me to be something akin to a sticky note, but that doesn't seem quite right because lightweight tags don't do anything as far as I can tell.

[11:45:03] <ikke> Kill-Animals: for realeases, it allows you specify exactly the commit that was released
[11:45:16] <ikke> Kill-Animals: so that it's unambiguous later
[11:47:41] <Kill-Animals> When you do a tag, do you have to manually specify the version number?
[11:48:05] <ikke> yes
[11:48:38] <cbreak> you can specify what you tag, and what name you tag it with
[11:48:45] <cbreak> this might or might not involve version numbers
[11:48:58] <Kill-Animals> ah okay, so a tag is you basically naming your commits. LW for unimportant ones, and annotated for big important commits.
[11:49:07] <cbreak> you can tag commits (that's what you'd normally tag), but also other objects

[15:19:28] <nedbat> Kill-Animals: the answer would be the same as for any feature: it's not a feature because the people designing the software didn't consider it useful enough to balance the cost of building and supporting it.
[15:19:47] <nedbat> Kill-Animals: it falls outside their intended use of the software.
[15:20:09] <nedbat> Kill-Animals: what's the harm in everyone getting the .qbs file?

[15:21:30] <nedbat> Kill-Animals: red herring how? Why would they pay any attention to it if they didn't know what it was?
[15:23:19] <Kill-Animals> nedbat: It also takes up space. Granted, in this case, it is kilobytes. The red herring could occur when it shows up in greps, and people aren't familiar with the QBS file.
[15:24:17] <nedbat> Kill-Animals: sure, but that's true of all sorts of files in large software projects
[15:24:33] <nedbat> Kill-Animals: and sometimes it's important to find that when grepping even when you don't know what it is
[15:24:54] <Kill-Animals> nedbat: I would assume other files are requisite to the project as a whole.
[15:26:03] <rudi_s> Kill-Animals: Git by default clones the full history of the project.
[15:26:20] <Kill-Animals> Hm, it could be useful if you grep for it, you are right. I think though that the cost of adding another file would outweigh the extra information
[15:26:31] <osse> You can tag the file and use that to retrieve the file on demand.
[15:26:35] <nedbat> Kill-Animals: you said the file was kilobytes
[15:26:46] <osse> But since it's related to building I would have it in there with all the others
[15:27:19] <Kill-Animals> nedbat: Yes. I mean in the sense when you `ls`, and have to sift through N files.
[15:27:27] <osse> A ton of projects have  a Makefile *and* a CMakeLists.txt *and* a foo.sln/foo.vxproj and so on.

[15:31:33] <mgedmin> "remain simple" presupposes that it currently is simple, which is debatable
[15:32:54] <Kill-Animals> mgedmin: Well this is Linus's program we are talking about.
[15:33:09] <Kill-Animals> He sees complexity as a feature, that chases away incompetents.
[15:33:11] <nedbat> Kill-Animals: i don't mean it's an option in Git. I mean it's an option among your project's collaborators
[15:33:29] <nedbat> Kill-Animals: if we do this, then when talking to your collaborators, you have to figure out if they have the full checkout or not.

[15:40:30] <Kill-Animals> nedbat: Right, that would complicate things. But that would also be a sign of inexperienced programmers, who would use that particular feature for files that were not holistically optional to achieving tasks.
[15:41:12] <nedbat> Kill-Animals: but why add that hurdle? Just to save downloading a small file? how many other files would be considered optional? it's not worth it.
[15:41:39] <nedbat> Kill-Animals: also, "sign of inexperienced programmers"?  You want to make it hard just to get the right set of files? Why not make it easier for inexperienced programmers?

[21:29:39] <nedbat> tharkun: what happens in the sub-repos? What makes sure they commit?
[21:29:56] <nedbat> tharkun: or are you thinking the global commit can involve all of the files in the tree, even ones in sub-repos?
[21:30:24] <osse> tharkun: You will not risk tracking the .git directory of an inner repo in the outer repo. Git won't allow that. But git will think you want to add it as a submodule
[21:30:51] <osse> I can't really tell if that's a good or a bad fit. Probably bad
[21:31:07] <tharkun> nedbat: I am working on my habits, but that is a totally different problem. Thanks for mentioning it.
[21:34:23] <tharkun> I am certain it is a bad decisition but I am a bit desperate to solve some problems because of lack of tracking.
