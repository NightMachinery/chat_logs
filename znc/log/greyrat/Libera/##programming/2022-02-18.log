[01:01:25] <ski> even if we find millions of them ?

[01:02:05] <ski> ah, right :D
[01:02:06] <pyzozord> in the end that kind of categorization is useful only as a communication tool, it doesn't need more precise definitions than people need when communicating those ideas

[01:10:41] <pyzozord> problem is that's not the right thing to do :P
[01:10:57] <phogg> duuude: hotjava? It was far more than proof of concept back when HTML3 was the state of the art.
[01:11:15] <duuude> HotJava had somewhat limited functionality compared to other browsers of its time. More critically, HotJava suffered from the inherent performance limitations of Java Virtual Machine implementations of the day (both in terms of processing speed and memory consumption) and hence was considerably sluggish.[7] 
[01:11:34] <duuude> well that is what I percieved after reading this
[01:11:34] <phogg> duuude: sluggish was a good word for it...
[01:12:06] <phogg> it was not pursued long enough to reach true maturity, but for a hot minute looked like an attempt by Sun to fight Netscape

[08:35:01] <anomal> ski: if they don't enclose state, what are they
[08:35:16] <ski> they close over an environment
[08:35:23] <ski> environment is different from state
[08:35:33] <anomal> ski: how
[08:35:52] <ski> environment consists of a mapping from names/identifiers to entities. state consists of a mutable mapping from locations to values
[08:36:08] <anomal> Those are just the same things 
[08:36:16] <ski> they are very different things
[08:36:35] <ski> in C, `int x = 3;' causes the identifier `x' to be bound to a location. that location is initially initialized with the value `3'
[08:36:52] <ski> the binding of `x' to a location is immutable
[08:37:12] <anomal> We're not discussing mutability
[08:37:17] <anomal> State can be immutable
[08:37:20] <ski> state is all about mutability
[08:38:36] <ski> in any case, it's good when we realize we place different meanings in these words :)
[08:38:54] <anomal> Well if state implied mutable, then it'd be redundant when people say "shared mutable state"
[08:38:59] <anomal> They'd just say "shared state"
[08:39:32] <sonny> they do ;)
[08:39:34] <ski> yes, i'd often say the latter, considering the former as an emphasis on the mutable aspect (e.g. over the shared aspect perhaps)
[08:40:11] <anomal> Do we actually need static types

[08:41:01] <anomal> Hence any
[08:41:06] <anomal> When do we need them
[08:41:34] <ski> e.g. static types is very useful for a safe implementation of STM, to ensure that you don't perform non-rollbackable effects during a transaction

[08:43:09] <anomal> Technically all you run statically can run at runtime
[08:43:14] <ski> no
[08:43:18] <anomal> Why
[08:43:20] <sonny> there's a lisp implementation of STM but I dunno how they did it

[08:45:18] <anomal> ski: you can check if it returns an integer
[08:45:35] <anomal> In fact a static check is much broader, it can make it impossible for a function that would return an int to run
[08:46:05] <ski> no, i'm not talking about checking if a *particular* call to the function returns an integer. i'm talking about checking that all *possible* calls to the function returns an integer
[08:46:15] <anomal> ski: let's say a function tosses a coin, tails returns int, heads returns string. Will this pass static check? No. But it'll work half the time without it
[08:46:44] <anomal> Therefore static checks are crude
[08:46:54] <anomal> And this is why the more you refine them, the less you can do
[08:47:07] <anomal> If you had to statically check everything, you'd be able to do nothing at all

[15:44:20] <edgar-rft> the winter solstice is an astronomical date celebrated since agriculture started, it was re-painted somewhere in the middle ages with the myth that some prophet was born on that date
[15:44:28] <mrig> I remember you mentioning in the past, interesting stuff.
[15:44:33] <anomal> ski: is there a lamdba calculus that doesn't require passing multiple args like nested functions
[15:45:01] <mrig> edgar-rft: do people in the tropics celebrate it too?
[15:45:05] <amigojapan> Sorry for bad memory

[15:45:21] <mrig> amigojapan: oh not at all, I appreciate the reminder.
[15:45:32] <amigojapan> biberao: a fan of what?
[15:45:43] <biberao> christianity and the calendar
[15:45:43] <amigojapan> :)
[15:45:57] <mrig> amigojapan: I found it really interesting that they used to set it to the time of inauguration of their leaders.
[15:45:58] <edgar-rft> mrig: probably not because they have a dry-time and rain-time weather cycle

[15:48:51] <KillerWasp> hello random mucus balls guys
[15:48:52] <biberao> santa claus in the summer is awesome
[15:49:08] <amigojapan> mrig: before covid it seemed all Australians came to Japan to go skiing

[21:59:38] * oldlaptop was sufficiently irritated by go's lame excuse for mandating brace-on-the-same-line to lose any real interest in it
[22:00:02] <anomal> oldlaptop: consistency is not a lame excuse
[22:00:24] <oldlaptop> and I'll put up with requiring brace-on-the-same-line if you have a *good* excuse, insted of nonsense surrounding semicolon elimination magic
[22:00:27] <pyzozord> oldlaptop: I can live with that, I'm excited by no bracets around if/for predicates
[22:00:39] <GeDaMo> anomal: some meta function to access the underlying data?
[22:00:57] <oldlaptop> if, for example, they were *honest* about merely desiring to impose their (bogus) coding style on everybody, I would be less irritated.
[22:01:40] <pyzozord> you can go in and change it, it's all written in go including the compiler
[22:01:50] <GeDaMo> Forth, for example has ' (tick) to get the execution token, basically the address
[22:01:52] <pyzozord> and since it's go, it's relatively simple code
[22:02:11] <absentia> syntactic problems can be fixed with another layer of preprocessing
[22:02:22] <oldlaptop> pyzozord: Creating the different, incompatible language oldlaptop-go would require more interest in it than I'm able to muster.
[22:02:27] <anomal> GeDaMo: I can go pedestrian and just use foo to refer to var and &foo to the function, because C people will "get it". But I find it also inelegant
[22:02:38] <pyzozord> oldlaptop: that's fair
[22:03:13] <pyzozord> go's imposed coding style doesn't bother me, in fact I think it looks quite good
[22:03:52] <pyzozord> for many years I didn't like the "crazy" idea with python intendtation based scopes
[22:04:17] <oldlaptop> I don't think brace-on-the-same-line is a good idea on balance. (Tcl gets a sort-of pass on the grounds that it is not in actual fact a curly brace language, and another sort-of pass in that it provides an \
[22:04:17] <oldlaptop> escape hatch
[22:04:22] <pyzozord> after I actually stated using python it turned out it gets out of the way and completly disappears and the language almost seem to read my mind
[22:04:50] <oldlaptop> I concur that python's whitespace syntax is not the horror it's occasionally made out to be.
[22:05:11] <GeDaMo> anomal: you basically want two 'modes' for a name
[22:05:11] <oldlaptop> But I *would* be pissed off if it tried, for example, to mandate four spaces (and nothing else) per level of indentation.
[22:05:41] <nomagno> I would still prefer it to be freeform, or at least have that as an optional feature
[22:05:42] <anomal> GeDaMo: that's my worry, that maybe I don't want two modes, but N modes.
[22:05:54] <oldlaptop> And I'd be *especially* pissed off if they refused to admit that this is because they like that style, and instead stretched and groped for some non-ideological excuse.
[22:05:59] <nomagno> is there a preprocessor that allows for semicolon and {} blocks in python?
[22:06:16] <anomal> GeDaMo: I have a rule of thumb. A rule is incomplete, unless it's defined recursively.
[22:06:22] <oldlaptop> python already does semicolons as... hm, I suppose as separators?
[22:06:25] <absentia> anomal: how do n modes differ from a single extremely permissive mode
[22:06:27] <anomal> GeDaMo: so what's the recursively meta version of the two modes
[22:06:37] <oldlaptop> it just accepts newlines as separators too (more or less)
[22:06:47] <GeDaMo> Lisp, for each name, has a value and a properties list
[22:07:21] <oldlaptop> (I'll clarify at this point that I don't actually like python very much, on balance. Whitespace syntax just isn't the reason.)

[23:45:45] <absentia> this is some real big brain shit
[23:46:27] <pyzozord> it's a math version of plumbus
[23:46:29] <GeDaMo> The Fourier transform translates between temporal and frequency domains
[23:46:59] <absentia> then the Taylor expansion translates between...
[23:47:05] <GeDaMo> (I don't really understand the maths, I just know what it does :P )
[23:47:15] <pyzozord> what is it? noone knows, but everyone knows it is made with shleem
[23:47:23] <absentia> they cut the shleem
[23:47:27] <absentia> ...
[23:47:28] <mrig> how many times you bang your head against the desk, rather than how often?
[23:48:10] <mrig> oh no that didn't work at all :|

[23:51:07] <pyzozord> is pretty weird
[23:51:33] <pyzozord> but whenever someone says "monad is just a monoid in the category of endofunctors" that's how I feel
[23:52:09] <mrig> its plumbus alright, and flombid :D
[23:52:17] <norias> oh what the hell
[23:52:26] <norias> is this a foreign language chan?
[23:52:33] <norias> i'm going back to #C++
[23:52:34] <Hash> Huih
[23:52:37] <Hash> No
[23:52:39] <Hash> I tweeted just now
[23:52:44] <Hash> I woke up in afternoon cuz I'm sleepy 
[23:52:53] <oldlaptop> norias: Programming languages are pretty foreign
[23:53:04] <norias> oldlaptop: to me, they seem to be.

[23:53:26] <absentia> ##hashtag
[23:53:27] <norias> what in the world is an endofunctor?
[23:53:36] <absentia> a functor from a category to itself
[23:53:41] <norias> omg.
[23:53:46] <Hash> endo means self generated inside.
[23:53:48] <norias> i thought you guys were just making up words
[23:53:57] <Hash> combine with functor.
[23:54:00] <absentia> no, the mathematicians already made them up
[23:54:04] <pyzozord> I tried to break it down with etymology before and it didn't help too much
[23:54:06] <Hash> It's a self referential function
[23:54:12] <absentia> it's not a function though
[23:54:20] <oldlaptop> The mathematicians make up whole numbers, it doesn't bug them to make up words.
[23:54:22] <pyzozord> endo I think it's something about ending and unit and combining?
[23:54:27] <norias> is there a career in just doing asm?
[23:54:33] <norias> i feel like there are less words
[23:54:35] <absentia> sure, welcome to embedded
[23:54:41] <norias> oh, good.
[23:54:45] <absentia> and absolute debugging hell
[23:54:47] <GeDaMo> There's also ##asm
[23:54:48] <Hash> How do you implement category theory?
[23:54:51] <Hash> Go on. I'll wait.
[23:54:54] <absentia> Hash: easily
[23:55:06] <Hash> Through a damn function.
[23:55:13] <Hash> All design patterns are functions.
[23:55:18] <absentia> how do you define function
[23:55:34] <Hash> A function is a function tha maps generates a mapping
[23:55:40] <Hash> functor*
[23:55:59] * absentia blinks
[23:56:16] <mrig> categories are far better in practice than in theory.

[23:56:37] <Hash> A functor is a function tha maps and generates mapping between categories in catheory theory afaik

[23:57:00] <mrig> every time you make a database schema or a struct you are indulging in it.
[23:57:06] <Hash> Functional programming is writing pure functions
[23:57:14] <Hash> I mean.

[23:57:16] <Hash> \o/
[23:58:08] <mrig> I like my functions as they are in C and go :)
[23:58:12] <GeDaMo> An array can be seen as a function with a limited domain
[23:58:22] <Hash> *nod* can be.
[23:58:33] <mrig> right yes, they are indeed very useful too.
[23:58:51] <mrig> very functional :)
[23:59:28] <mrig> Handy when writing binary files too.
