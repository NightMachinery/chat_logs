[02:59:41] <FlorianBad> FunkyBob: hmm, not sure how to interpret it. Does it mean that webkit is only for older versions of chrome? (before 4)
[02:59:57] <FlorianBad> actually <26
[03:00:09] <FunkyBob> "do I need it" is basically "how old do you want to support?"
[03:00:49] <FunkyBob> but those look like quite old versions
[03:00:50] <FlorianBad> oh yeah I think I get it. So basically anyone since 2015 will be fine?
[03:01:01] <FunkyBob> it suggests 96% of people support it

[04:10:42] <bobdobbs> Hi all. I'm having trouble with a flex layout. Should be relatively simple, but I'm stumped. (I'm probably missing something obvious). The page I'm working on is here: http://dev2.solarshift.org/
[04:11:48] <FunkyBob> `v
[04:11:48] <Selvvir> FunkyBob, « http://dev2.solarshift.org/ » markup • errors: 38 • warnings: 19 • charset: UTF-8 • validation result: https://bit.ly/3yWG31w
[04:11:48] <bobdobbs> Under the heading 'The Team' there are four boxes. The third box has the title 'Angela Rinaldi'. That's my target example, but what I'm working on should apply to all the boxes...
[04:11:48] <FunkyBob> <link rel="https://api.w.org/"
[04:12:01] <FunkyBob> am wondering if this is the same site, or some people are using the same brokentemplate?
[04:12:46] <FunkyBob> some of those errors in the HTML are quite serious, bobdobbs ... like missing/unbalanced quotes in attributes
[04:13:01] <bobdobbs> Basically I'm trying to get the footer with the gray background to sit at the bottom of it's container. The container has 'display: flex' set, and the flex layout is set to column.
[04:13:06] <bobdobbs> FunkyBob: hmmm
[04:16:14] <bobdobbs> FunkyBob: I'll start fixing those now. And yes, I'm using a template
[04:18:12] <FunkyBob> if you paid for it, ask for your money back... that link stuff is absurd
[04:20:41] <bobdobbs> FunkyBob: which link stuff in particular?

[04:22:26] <bobdobbs> FunkyBob: Googling tells me that this that particular error is related to a WordPress hack that might be native to the CMS. Looks like removing it should be harmless though.
[04:22:29] <FunkyBob> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Link_types
[04:22:55] <FunkyBob> bobdobbs: well, that explains a lot
[04:22:55] <bobdobbs> thanks
[04:23:49] <bobdobbs> I'm guessing that it might be a hack for enabling the REST api?
[04:24:16] <FunkyBob> no idea... I don't WP
[04:30:12] <FunkyBob> does feel very on-brand for WP to do something this stupid, instead of using standard features
[04:32:14] <bobdobbs> FunkyBob: the hooks to remove that bit of markup look like core wp things: http://pastie.org/p/4FXGfgCN5GJ4i2iar6Ueri
[04:32:42] <FunkyBob> ok... that's between you and WP
[04:33:17] <bobdobbs> FunkyBob: oh yeah, sure. I guess I'm just saying that it looks like the markup isn't added by a plugin or theme
[04:34:05] <bobdobbs> k, this is an interesting adventure. One of the error is related to an attribute 'migration_allowed'.  But unless my google-fu is broken, I can't find anything about this attribute
[04:34:57] <bobdobbs> looks like it might be injected by the page builder plugin. Curious.
[04:35:11] <FunkyBob> I wouldn't worry so much about undefined attributes
[04:35:34] <FunkyBob> Error: Duplicate attribute src.
[04:36:25] <bobdobbs> yeah, that looks like a bug for sure

[23:54:35] <FlorianBad> Is it safe to overflow a flexbox `display:flex;align-items:center;justify-content:flex-start;flex-wrap:nowrap;`  hoping that everything will always be centered vertically, even what overflows?

[23:57:27] <FlorianBad> well, `flex-wrap:nowrap` while the width is limited should make the content overflow, in theory. But will the vertical centering still always be safe that way?

[23:58:18] <hassoon> FlorianBad: try it in a fiddle and see
[23:58:24] <FlorianBad> lol
[23:58:43] <FlorianBad> try and see doesn't really ansewr the question "is it safe?"
[23:58:58] <hassoon> FlorianBad: if you try it, you'll know
[23:59:01] <FlorianBad> I know it works, that's not my concern, the real question is, will it always work
[23:59:08] <FlorianBad> no I won't
[23:59:15] <hassoon> FlorianBad: yep, mess with it, and you'll know
[23:59:20] <hassoon> FlorianBad: then your loss
