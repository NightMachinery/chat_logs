[10:45:07] <Aryan[m]> <Arya[m]> "image.png" <- Those who say "I use arch btw" unironically have installed it after following a install guide on YouTube because they couldn't understand arch wiki.üôÇ
[10:47:24] <Arya[m]> lol
[10:47:28] <Arya[m]> i didnt
[10:47:42] <Arya[m]> for btrfs configuration i did
[10:47:44] <Arya[m]> tho
[10:50:13] <relejek[m]> <Aryan[m]> "Those who say "I use arch btw..." <- i didn't had internet configured so i had install guide printed LOL. it is hard to look at it in small smartphone screens.
[10:51:07] <Arya[m]> lol
[10:51:21] <Arya[m]> i actually installed arch a weird way a while back
[10:51:31] <Arya[m]> i was too lazy to reflash my usb so i just used the nixos iso
[10:51:46] <Arya[m]> with the arch-bootstrap tarball
[10:51:47] <Arya[m]> and did a gentoo like install
[10:51:50] <relejek[m]> yeah i know fun stuff. felt great when it was done and i had internet finally.
[10:52:35] <relejek[m]> Arya[m]: my doooodeeee. what is that salad . lmao
[10:52:56] <Arya[m]> i got the tarball from the mirror
[10:53:07] <Arya[m]> then mounted the drives to /root.x86_64
[10:53:14] <Arya[m]> then uncompressed the tarball
[10:53:32] <Arya[m]> after that i chrooted with /root.x86_64/bin/arch-chroot
[10:53:40] <Arya[m]> and then installed everything again and updated
[10:53:44] <Arya[m]> just in case
[10:53:49] <relejek[m]> oh you did it like that.
[10:53:55] <Arya[m]> the bootstrap only gives base
[10:54:31] <relejek[m]> i get you. arch and gentoo are flexible enough. i tried that with ubuntu, that was an headache.
[10:54:43] <Arya[m]> yup
[10:54:47] <Arya[m]> never do with ubuntu 
[10:54:49] <Arya[m]> and co.
[10:54:56] <Arya[m]> it should be pretty simple
[10:55:03] <Arya[m]> they just use the squashfs fs
[10:55:05] <Arya[m]> or something
[10:55:22] <Arya[m]> it was way weirder due to nix tho
[10:55:33] <Arya[m]> i had to export the path and stuff as nix has weird $PATH
[10:55:51] <relejek[m]> hmhmhmmh
[10:56:04] <relejek[m]> that does sound complicated.
[11:13:44] <iamak[m]> <Aryan[m]> "Those who say "I use arch btw..." <- I had to go 2 weeks without wifi on Arch before I could configure it. Had to borrow friend's ethernet cable for internet xD

[11:59:09] <Arya[m]> and tmux because no buffers
