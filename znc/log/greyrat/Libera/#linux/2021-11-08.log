[00:46:31] <tirnanog> arseru: and, finally, to undo whatever random modification was applied to .xinitrc
[00:46:34] <knotMez> arseru my fix may be just half of it? As in the other half may have just worked on my system
[00:47:09] <arseru> knotMez: it could be, yes, maybe those services where already running for you but you had some extra misconfig?
[00:47:21] <tirnanog> arseru: I think the explanation for this is simple enough. i3wm is just a barebones window manager. if you need to run applications that expect to have other infrastructure running, it's up to you to make sure it is provided for.
[00:47:33] <tirnanog> arseru: in this case, the xdg-desktop-portal user service.
[00:47:34] <knotMez> arseru yeah it was half installed or something? Because i don't use gnome either

[07:05:26] <tirnanog> LordDragon: I don't know all that much about bluetooth in linux but what does the script do exactly?
[07:05:34] <LordDragon> this is all it does: echo 'Y' > /sys/module/bluetooth/parameters/disable_ertm
[07:05:36] <rascul> oh noes!
[07:05:57] <tirnanog> LordDragon: so it writes to sysfs. probably udev'able also.
[07:05:59] <LordDragon> so im guessing udev could be used for that scenario as well?
[07:06:06] <tirnanog> yes, I imagine it could be.
[07:06:33] <tirnanog> LordDragon: can you get some information with "udevadm info /sys/module/bluetooth"?

[07:11:13] <tirnanog> LordDragon: come to think of it, while this could be done with udev, given that it's a module parameter, /etc/modprobe.d would be a better fit. I'm pretty sure that all you have to do is create a file under /etc/modprobe.d (say, "bluetooth.conf"), then define this within it: options bluetooth disable_ertm=1

[07:24:56] <tirnanog> it's tangientally related to udev because the modprobe utility also gets called in response to uevents.

[07:25:36] <tirnanog> it's just that modprobe has its own support for fine-tuning module options which is, indeed, simple.
[07:25:55] <LordDragon> theres no such module for cpu control?
[07:26:17] <Blondie101010> good question
[07:26:28] <Blondie101010> I think it is a module
[07:26:28] <tirnanog> no, there isn't.

[07:27:06] <tirnanog> well, the individual scaling drivers can be implemented as modules. but, as far as I'm aware, they don't accept parameters of the kind that you've seen under sysfs.

[07:29:11] <tirnanog> Blondie101010: no, because the range of available governors doesn't fundamentally change what's exposed in sysfs for a given driver and/or what options are supported for a given module. so, if the question is "can we configure a governor via modprobe.d?", the answer is always going to be defined by the options (if any) for the module that provides the scaling driver being used. enabling or disabling
[07:29:12] <tirnanog> others won't change that.

[07:43:00] <tirnanog> LordDragon: good question. it would definitely depend on the scaling driver that's being used. in general, unless you're using the acpi-cpufreq driver (highly unlikely) the effect of the performance governor is not to lock the frequency at the maximum.

[07:49:45] <tirnanog> LordDragon: basically, it matches against every entry beneath /sys/devices/system/cpu/. if you look, you'll see a sub-directory for each core.
[07:50:00] <tirnanog> LordDragon: so, not recursively. rather, the attribute matching is generic enough not to match a _specific_ cpu.

[09:09:38] <AndrewYu> Ok. So problem: when I go like `grep "grepper" | cut -d " " -f 2-`, it only spits output every end-of-file. If I do the grep or cut independently, it spits output every line. What's wrong?

However, historically, when X11 was being made, bloat was particularly lighter than today's, and so **IF** you use a very light window manager with X, it might be lighter (memory-wise) than a Wayland composer (though still slower, depending on various things).

[13:49:16] <jim> cadmio. and if that's the case, then looping the _count call will be a forever loop
[13:49:29] <phogg> if the buffer is implicitly at the end, somehow, and you only search forward, and you don't wrap, then that would explain the result

[13:58:09] <jim> if that never breaks out of the loop, then maybe you're expected to do something about scanning the search context
[13:58:12] <fdan> what does more request for CPU mean phogg
[13:58:21] <phogg> fdan: if one process wants 100% of the CPU and another process wants 100% of the CPU then load average will go to 2.
[13:58:35] <cadmio> well that's now working either

[14:01:08] <phogg> that could also show as high load average

[14:02:06] <fdan> why this could cause the load average to be higher

[14:03:37] <phogg> fdan: the amount might be small, so you won't see the process in top(1) or the like, but if you're doing this thousands of times per second the overall CPU usage can be high
[14:03:42] <phogg> hence high load average

[16:01:18] <bsandro> yeah. I find helpful for that to use completely different-feeling keyboards
[16:01:22] <Blondie101010> so you should not change your keyboard layout when you're used to one

[19:06:44] <ignapk> TJ-: it's actually hard to tell because I can only see it on a wallpaper and some games, but if I continue to have this problem will try to have something to compare to next to the monitor
[19:06:55] <TJ-> cottnn: there must be an existing wrapper that can read a text file and stick -- on the front of each line and then launch the application with the required command-line args

[19:14:03] <hodapp> cottnn: this whole routine of "everyone does it this way" -> "anyone who does it different is dumb", and of assuming people's motives and intentions and then judging them for it (as has happened in many convos here with you), is kinda old

I have an intel n2600 and it supports 32 bit, but the BIOS lies about it and the kernel therefore fails to boot. Ubuntu and Alpine linux both boot successfully in 64 bit mode, for some reason, probably because they patched their kernels.

[21:54:59] <AquaL1te> hi, i'm looking for a fancy way to have 2 firewall profiles. one will be enabled at boot. which doesn't include an allowlist of IPs (users). this is to make sure a system is first checked by a human, before putting it back in production. to do that, a different firewall set is loaded, which adds the allowlist. i don't think this can be doen with systemd. i was thinking along the lines of `systemctl start
[21:55:05] <AquaL1te> nftables@production.service` which loads the allowlist. but at booting, it loads `nftables@.service`, which doesn't include the argument to load the profile which includes the allowslit. but that won't work. because `nftables@.service` is a different instance. so 2 units will then be running... any suggestions to improve this? maybe a system conflict thingy, that stops the other one?
[21:55:17] <TJ-> bullgard4: they are spaced since they are stand-alone not attached to the text around them
[21:55:28] <bullgard4> Sauvin, I  it?suspect the same. - But is there no typographical rule that reguires
[21:55:29] * Sauvin grabs a coffee and prepares to read a novella
[21:55:58] <bullgard4> Sauvin, I  suspect the same. - But is there no typographical rule that reguires it?
[21:56:05] <Sauvin> bullgard4, when writing man page synopses, I'm not aware of any such rule, no.
[21:56:07] <ayecee> AquaL1te: the second one adds extra rules beyond the first one, right? they could both be "running" at once.
[21:56:42] <Sauvin> Mandatory disclosure: I've never written a man page in my whole life.
[21:56:45] <AmR> Any one know know web browser Can built in static way and support multi platforms ?
[21:56:45] <bullgard4> Sauvin, Thank you very much for your thorough help.
[21:57:20] <TJ-> AquaL1te: you could use a tool like firewalld for that with changing --system /path/to/config possibly
[21:57:24] <ayecee> bullgard4: in the "man man" page, when describing the synopsis section, [ ] can be used to identify options that can be repeated multiple times. in this case, since there's already [] used for optional arguments, {} is used around these for clarity.
[21:57:39] <AquaL1te> ayecee: true, but if you load the second unit file twice, it will add those rules as well. unless you do a `flush ruleset`, but then the first instance's rules are gone
[21:57:42] <ayecee> but this use of {} isn't described in the man man manpage

[21:58:55] <TJ-> AquaL1te: nftables@.service isn't an instantiated service it is the template
[21:58:59] <AquaL1te> ayecee: true, but if someone makes changes in the allowlist, then reloads it, then it will add the new one, but also all the old ones. it will just append those rules

[22:01:01] <AquaL1te> TJ-: i'm considering making a custom unit file. but i don't think this is possible. i guess i will have the default firewall ruleset. which has an empty chain called 'allowlist'. then when the second systemd unit starts, it will include the first one (Which includes a flush), and then add the allowlist. but then to play nice, it has to stop the first systemd unit first. otherwise it's ugly

[23:49:14] <Gamah> znf: dunno what tool this is you're measuring throughput with, but how far off is it from the numbers you expect? and is it writing to the block device or a filesystem which could be chewing up some overhead?
[23:49:27] <Sauvin> Kubuntu 20.04 here. I have no /proc/dynamic*
[23:49:45] <znf> Gamah, I'm just using atop to check info at a glance
[23:49:57] <Gamah> what are you using to produce your load?
[23:50:17] <znf> I barely have any writes on the filesystem, is 99.999% reads, as you can see from the screenshot, 0 writes
[23:50:20] <Gamah> how are the drives connected? bottleneck in a seta bus or something?
[23:50:26] <Gamah> sata*
[23:50:26] <znf> nothing, it's actually in production right now :)
[23:50:37] <znf> that's the real scenario, unfolding before my eyes :)

[23:51:54] <Gamah> and how far off are the numbers you're seeing from the ones you're expecting?
[23:52:29] <znf> I'd expect to saturate a 20Gbit/s network port with the reads from it; I'm seeing it struggle at 8-9Gbit/s to keep up

[23:53:22] <znf> because the disks can't supply the data fast enough
[23:53:25] <Gamah> do you have the CPU to do that? are the drives connected to a controller that can do that throughput
