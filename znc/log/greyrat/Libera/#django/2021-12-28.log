[08:31:22] <pembo13> gulzar, what's the error?
[08:34:08] <gulzar> pembo13: https://paste.debian.net/1225010/
[08:35:16] <gulzar> pembo13: browser gives, Inernal Srever error.    This happens when I import pandas in tasks.py and restart apacche
[08:36:43] <pembo13> gulzar, why do you think that importing pandas is causing this?
[08:36:59] <gulzar> pembo13: as i read onnline , the numpy, the C is the reason. No idea
[08:37:21] <pembo13> that sounds suspect
[08:38:30] <pembo13> but I'm seeing the same assertions online that I guess you found

[08:44:37] <pembo13> gulzar, did you use "WSGIProcessGroup" or "WSGIApplicationGroup", and was it in the VirtualHost?
[08:46:56] <gulzar> pembo13: https://paste.debian.net/1225011/    I have such configs for multiple websites
[08:47:58] <gulzar> that global in depth is added like 10 min ago
[08:48:51] <pembo13> gulzar, okay... I'm out of my depth... I've long since moved away from mod_wsgi
[08:53:44] <gulzar> pembo13: ha , so what you use
[08:54:04] <pembo13> I use Nginx+Gunicorn
[08:54:23] <pembo13> but if you need Apache, mod_proxy + (some WSGI server) should work
[08:55:05] <gulzar> I can comment pandas, restart apache. Kill celery, uncomment pandas. and it works   . But not a long term solution
[08:55:17] <gulzar> pembo13: ok, will look into those
[08:55:40] <pembo13> gulzar, mod_wsgi works, but it has several limitations

[09:13:15] <gulzar> pembo13: it was simplest so used intitally like 4yr ago
[09:13:31] <pembo13> gulzar, yup... i thought the same when I started out
[09:13:44] <pembo13> in reality, nginx is actually easier
[09:16:52] <gulzar> pembo13: I was websites in cgi, tomccat. all llinked with apache.  So didsn't want to disturb it
[09:17:13] <pembo13> gulzar, completely understand... my motivation was the same
[09:17:48] <gulzar> can I use apache and django with non wsgi tool
[09:18:10] <gulzar> I am slowly migrating all to django. Once that's done. I can replace anything.
[09:18:19] <pembo13> gulzar, like I had suggested above, you can use mod_proxy
[09:18:34] <pembo13> you'll still need a WSGI server inbetween however
[09:19:29] <gulzar> I will try to move all to django asap. and switch to Nginx + gunicorn

[12:55:00] <dodo> pycode1: why is it problem that it takes a long time to run?
[12:55:17] <dodo> pycode1: just paremeterize it and call the command multiple times in parallel?
[12:56:19] <pycode1> dodo, no basically at the moment it get some data from db and then i spawn process inside the command, but i have some problem with memory that is increasing overtime i do no know the reason
[12:56:29] <pycode1> i am using mp.Pool
[12:56:54] <pycode1> dodo, so should i create TWO commands? one that create the big loop and that call the other command to execute the task ?
[12:58:30] <dodo> hm, i don't know your code. do you have a memory leak, or does the job just use lots of memory?
[12:59:09] <dodo> (and why do you ask if you should implement mp if you already use it?)
[13:01:09] <pycode1> dodo, because i wonder if there are some problem with mp and django commands... yes basically for some reason the memory is growing...i knot the task are heavy but after each task py should free the memory
[13:01:12] <pycode1> but seems not
[13:01:15] <pycode1> i wonder why

[14:23:44] <luigibu> hi! im using django-smart-selects to populate a dropdown when the parent dropdown chnages (ChainedForeignKey), it works great but.. when from the parent dropdawn i do not select anything.. currently.. it shows child dropdown empty.. and what i need is to select the elements with the dependent FK set to null. is is posible? maybe another component?

[16:19:19] <withered_wolf> Is it considered bad practice to have a One-To-One relationship that may be null? I figure it's essentially a null FK which (from the database side) isn't great. Just curious for folks feelings on it.
[16:21:26] <doismellburning> withered_wolf: I don't see why that would be bad
[16:21:27] <GinFuyou> That's absolutely normal, why would it be bad? It may be indeed exactly not "great" in some aspects, but again, what's technically wrong with it if it does the job?
[16:23:01] <doismellburning> (to go a little further, I'm not sure why a null FK "isn't great")
[16:25:03] <GinFuyou> I think there are some points on DB level, but I'm not very knowing in this field.

[16:35:41] <withered_wolf> I'm not totally sure what performance hits there are, but it was explained to me (by a db admin) that blank FK's should be avoided unless they just can't be, because of performance at the DB level. He went into it a little bit as to why, but that's been some time ago so I don't recall the reasoning.
[16:36:21] <withered_wolf> I was just curious as to others opinions on the matter.

[17:08:18] <imakestuff> I've done 3 django projects already and they all have one app
[17:08:31] <imakestuff> what's a good scenario that warrants creating more?
[17:09:13] <imakestuff> is there a scenario that you had more than one and actually helped by it?
[17:10:46] <GinFuyou> apps is just a way to organize code. Only one purely objective scenario to separate an app - making a reusable one
[17:14:30] <withered_wolf> Where I'm at, we've got a number of projects with multiple apps. Most are grouped by the overall theme of what the project is. i.e. in one case we have a project surrounding 'extra' stuff with an app for managing overtime, an app for tracking mileage driven, and a third app for managing something else I can't remember. All related, but different enough so we separate them out and each has a unique template/look/feel.
[17:15:20] <GinFuyou> Yeah, same for me
[17:20:00] <withered_wolf> @imakestuff could you show me the link where it recommends using a directory called apps? The tutorial appears to be using base/app_name/
