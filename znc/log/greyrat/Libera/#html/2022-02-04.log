This is what I have so far: https://i.imgur.com/LqlQdQf.png (yes, it's a triangle, would like it more of a curved up tab). This is the code for it so far, https://pastebin.com/5UqjXdPx any help is appreciated. Thank you.

[17:56:30] <tetrapod> What's the correct markup for a span and h1,2,3 element? Does the h1 go inside the span, the other way around, or as sibling?  <span><h1>Hello</h1>World!</span>  or <h1>Hello</h1><span>World!</span> or <h1>Hello<span>World!</span></h1> 
[17:56:57] *** Quits: brentaarnold (~brentaarn@24.112.58.14) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[17:58:00] <stenno> <h1><span>Hello</span>World</h1>
[17:58:06] <lilmonkey`> tetrapod, phrasing-level elements like spans can only contain other phrasing-level elements
[17:58:13] <tetrapod> stenno D;
[17:58:47] <tetrapod> lilmonkey`ah, so not span as parent to h1? 
[17:58:48] <lilmonkey`> And while the 'sibling' set-up isn't necessarily invalid, it doesn't really make sense.
[17:59:07] <stenno> neither does <h1><span>...</span></h1>
[17:59:09] <lilmonkey`> tetrapod, right
[17:59:16] <lilmonkey`> stenno, why?
[17:59:31] <tetrapod> Because then your text is part of your title. 
[18:00:02] <stenno> lilmonkey`: in which situation _would_ it make sense?
[18:00:25] <stenno> note that i don't have another text node outside the span
[18:00:31] <lilmonkey`> stenno, styling hook
[18:00:41] <stenno> well, ok
[18:01:52] <tetrapod> lilmonkey` I think phrase elements arn't  a thing in html5, only HTML<4.0.1 
[18:02:47] <tetrapod> oh scrap that. I'm lying :D 
[18:03:05] <lilmonkey`> Wut. Phrasing content was not a thing before HTML5. The only distinction used to be inline-level vs. block-level. HTML5 introduced a slew of new types, among which is phrasing content.
[18:04:33] <tetrapod> It was, span wasn't a part of that though. https://www.w3.org/TR/html401/struct/text.html#h-9.2.1
[18:04:47] <lilmonkey`> And what I said before isn't actually entirely correct: there are exceptions to that rule, like how <a> elements allow "block-level" content.

[18:05:11] <lilmonkey`> tetrapod, ah, right

[18:05:43] <lilmonkey`> Well either way, the general rule is no "block-level" inside of "inline-level", with some exceptions.
[18:05:55] <lilmonkey`> stenno, yes
[18:06:12] *** Joins: luva (~luva@45.141.152.62)
[18:06:27] <tetrapod> but still, <h1>header<span>text</span></h1> implies that the text is part of the header
[18:06:31] <stenno> oh lilmonkey` i was confused a few days ago when reading the specs: the question in this channel was, 'is <object> allowed inside <label>'. I read the specs but got confused
[18:06:35] <stenno> tetrapod: because it is
[18:06:41] <lilmonkey`> tetrapod, yes, of course
[18:07:00] <lilmonkey`> wait, who still uses <object>? :D
[18:07:15] <stenno> not me, the question just showed up
[18:07:20] <stenno> so i checked <object>
[18:07:22] <stenno> https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/iframe-embed-object.html#the-object-element
[18:07:34] <stenno> in category, it says 'phrasing content'
[18:07:38] <tetrapod> The other way around would be better but that's not allowed, so I guess siblings is the way to go?
[18:07:45] <stenno> however:
[18:07:49] <stenno> Contexts in which this element can be used:
[18:07:50] <stenno> Where embedded content is expected.\
[18:08:06] <lilmonkey`> tetrapod, what are you trying to achieve, conceptually?
[18:08:10] <stenno> label tells me:
[18:08:12] <stenno> Content model:
[18:08:14] <stenno> Phrasing content, but with no descendant labelable elements

[18:08:33] <tetrapod> lilmonkey` a title describing a paragraph below it. 
[18:09:44] <stenno> so is <object> in the 'phrasing content' category now? the expression 'where embedded content is expected' threw me off
[18:10:34] <lilmonkey`> stenno, yeah, looks like it's valid. The validator accepts it.
[18:11:07] <stenno> ooh embedded is a strict subset of phrasing
[18:11:10] <stenno> i just saw the graph
[18:11:13] <stenno> right ok, thanks
[18:11:17] <lilmonkey`> tetrapod, ok but what's with the span then?
[18:11:42] <tetrapod> was just wondering what the proper place for it is. 
[18:12:06] *** Joins: brentaarnold (~brentaarn@24.112.58.14)
[18:12:19] <lilmonkey`> stenno, it's interesting that the spec doesn't say something akin to 'no interactive content' for labels. Labels are interactive and objects obviously can be.
[18:12:29] <lilmonkey`> tetrapod, why do you need it?
[18:12:55] <tetrapod> to style my paragraph
[18:13:45] <lilmonkey`> tetrapod, in your example, is "world" the paragraph? O_o
[18:14:01] <tetrapod> yea...
[18:14:13] <tetrapod> Didnt want to include an actual paragraph. 
[18:14:38] <lilmonkey`> Oh, ok. "Hello world" seems like it belongs together ;)
[18:14:55] <tetrapod> hm... I see how that might've been confusing. 
[18:14:57] <lilmonkey`> So just `<h1>Heading</h1><p>Paragraph</p>` then… no span needed.
[18:15:19] <lilmonkey`> Might wanna go over the basics.
[18:15:32] <tetrapod> Oh wait... 
[18:16:27] <tetrapod> I think someone rewired my brain while i was sleeping last night :'D. Why am I using a span?
[18:18:08] <tetrapod> So eh.. <p><h1>helloworld</h1> here goes a whole paragraph of text</p> or <h1>helloworld</h1> <p>here goes a whole paragraph of text</p> ?
[18:18:24] <lilmonkey`> I… just told you.
[18:18:48] <lilmonkey`> The former isn't valid. Paragraphs only accept phrasing-level elements.
[18:19:31] <lilmonkey`> (And the same is true for heading elements, incidentally)
