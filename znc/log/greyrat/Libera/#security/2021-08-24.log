A VM might be a bit better for very high-level attacks but I don't think it's worth the trouble over firejail unless you have a particular reason to want to go that extra mile (particularily sensitive data, reason to expect to be targeted for an attack...)

[16:20:53] <jaggz> I tried Russia already, but they're not telling me what the vulnerabilities are so I can address it.
[16:21:23] <jaggz> piou, more like: "this is a service that should be offered by the govt for all citizens"
[16:21:49] <jaggz> (possibly contracted out to various companies to have a good range of services available)

[16:30:02] <piou> Your IP was never secret and has always been scanned daily by bots on the internet looking for vulnerable machines, so its leaking is unlikely to be the actual start of your issues. If you do have issues though standard procedure apply: check the rules on your firewall (probably integrated to your box), antivirus check, and if the doubt persists full system reinstallation is the best way to deal
[16:30:08] <piou> with malware. Unless you're some journalist or embassador you are extremely unlikely to be confronted to an issue that these simple actions cannot solve, meaning that any perceived issue after that is almost certainly non-malicious (ie: either your imagination or regular bugs).
[16:31:08] *** Joins: chiselfuse (~chiselfus@user/chiselfuse)
[16:32:19] <piou> jaggz: was my question difficult to understand? I'm asking if it was the external IP address of your home network by opposition to a company network or hosted server for example. Home networks tend to rely on the default configuration of the network equipments provided by the ISP which are...not that great but reasonnable against most attacks.

[16:33:40] <piou> I care for the reasons explained just above
[16:33:42] <jaggz> none of this is relevant for examining a network for vulnerabilities
[16:34:01] <piou> Examining a network for vulnerabilities doesn't seem relevant to your use case at all
[16:34:10] <jaggz> it would be through a single IP interface to a lan (ie. through a router/firewall)

[16:34:44] <jaggz> well, once the internal lan stuff's been compromised, yeah.. it's much less relevant
[16:35:08] <jaggz> with multiple systems being affected internally all able to do whatever.. bleh
[16:35:12] <jaggz> scary stuff
[16:35:44] <jm18> <jaggz> it would be through a single IP interface to a lan (ie. through a router/firewall)  <-- well a corporation/company would likely have multiple IPs/interfaces so you already made it relevant
[16:36:06] <piou> jaggz: Furthermore a remote scan would only see what ports and services are exposed on the internet. And if we're talking about your home network using the default configuration of regular ISP-provided equipments then there won't be anything interesting to see

[16:36:45] <piou> jaggz: so all of a sudden you're looking at 1) an attack through other means (probably email), 2) a penetration test made through a vpn in order to actually see your home network and not just the front door
[16:36:52] <piou> jaggz: all of this is relevant

[16:39:01] <jaggz> I recently installed openwrt instead of the commerical router firmware too
[16:39:51] <jaggz> I for some reason feel dlink, netsys, tplink, cisco, etc. are relatively on-top of their router security..
[16:39:59] <jaggz> although not as configurable and sometimes not updating stuff
[16:40:16] <jaggz> thinking openwrt may be a mistake, with who knows how many vulnerabilities are in it or planted in the project
[16:40:40] <piou> I would trust openwrt much more than dlink and such
[16:40:49] <[iz]> just don't make it accessable from remote
[16:40:52] <piou> there rarely is a dlink router without stupid vulnerability
[16:41:03] <jaggz> [iz] that's what I want to test.. more than just an nmap
[16:41:04] <piou> But that doesn't mean they're exploitable from the internet
[16:41:13] <piou> jaggz: Also, have you considered the possibility that you weren't attacked at all? Now I'm not saying that you're lying about anything, but a common theme among non-security specialists is that once they identify a possible security breach they fear an intrusion and issues that would have been normal random bugs a few days prior suddenly become interpreted as signs of a malware. Don't get me
[16:41:19] <piou> wrong, it is possible that you were attacked, but in practice targetted attacks are rare than people think and malwares tend to stay discreet. So you should probably try to identify whether you were effectively attacked.
[16:41:28] <[iz]> if it's not accepting connections, it won't accept connections
[16:42:08] <[iz]> if you were attacked, a malware/browser based attack will be much more likely than a router based attack

[16:42:31] <piou> jaggz: if you don't want to pay a professional then your best bet is to explain your context in detail here to at least get free opinion. And from what you've given so far it is unlikely to be a network attack through your internet router.

[19:17:58] <piou> I tend to avoid SQL/XSS scanners during a pentest, they generally cause way too much noise and have a reasonnable risk to break something. With experience it's generally faster to find them by hand too, and you'll find issues that the tools can't pick up. So there's really little upside most of the time.
[19:18:56] <piou> Not to say that dislike all tools, I love sqlmap for example, but not for finding the SQLi (that's my job, if a tool could do it reliably I wouldn't have a job), I find it useful to *exploit* the SQLi once found
[19:19:06] <Hash> *nod* good advice
