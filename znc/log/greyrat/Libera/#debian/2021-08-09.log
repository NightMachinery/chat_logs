[00:14:17] <plantroon> hello, how is the netfilter and firewalld situation in Debian Buster? For example, to use firewalld, I should uninstall nftables package to not have it mess with firewalld - but what if I want to display the current ruleset and am missing that nft binary?

[00:17:06] <PMT> plantroon: since "nftables" has "Suggests: firewalld", I don't really think uninstalling nftables for firewalld is a suggestion.
[00:17:57] <plantroon> I was more worried about nftables service possibly overwriting whatever firewalld had configured, if it starts up (but it's disabled bydefault? Still weird to have the service around)

[06:24:53] <PMT> I don't know why you're still trying to fix what isn't broken. It's just a warning, it's not complaining that it won't use the package lists.
[06:25:25] <jhutchins> tharkun: Mine: https://paste.debian.net/1206997
[06:25:41] <greatcoof> PMT: should i worry about grub showing winhows as a boot option?
[06:25:53] <PMT> greatcoof: is there windows installed somewhere?
[06:25:59] <greatcoof> PMT: yes
[06:26:05] <greatcoof> confusing i know
[06:26:06] <PMT> greatcoof: then why would you be worried?
[06:27:11] <greatcoof> PMT: idk , worried about grub dding dev/zero no all my disks or something
[06:29:31] <PMT> Seems unlikely.

[06:30:12] <greatcoof> so grub CANT delete my stuff...
[06:32:04] <greatcoof> also my $PATH is probably screwed , that's wy commands dont work or only work with sudo

[06:32:33] <PMT> No, sbin often isn't in PATH for nonroot users.
[06:33:24] <greatcoof> PMT: even if im root ...i run poweroff and doesn't work , i run sudo peweroff and it works
[06:33:51] <greatcoof> pretty funny that i have to run sudo when im root huh?
[06:34:29] <jhutchins> greatcoof: actually, no, it's not funny it's wrong.

[06:35:09] <jhutchins> greatcoof: root already has all the permissions that can be conferred by sudo.
[06:35:46] <PMT> yes, as jhutchins said, that is indeed probably screwed.
[06:36:10] <greatcoof> jhutchins: idk that much about how sudo works , but my guess is sudo uses the full path
[06:36:33] <jhutchins>  greatcoof: My guess is that you're using su to become root instead of su -.
[06:37:08] <greatcoof> su -.?
[06:37:37] <jhutchins> greatcoof: just su -
[06:37:47] <jhutchins> \!su
[06:37:53] <jhutchins> !su
[06:37:54] <dpkg> extra, extra read all about it, su is switch/set user. It is used to change User ID's and/or gain super user access. Since Debian Buster, "su -" or "su -l" is needed to access programs located in /sbin (see <buster su>). It provides an root environment as if the superuser had logged in directly. See "man su".

[14:08:53] <pjb> nomad_dw: indeed, I set my own PS1; I could test for CHROOT environment variable in my .bashrc to set the PS1 as I wish.

[14:10:58] <Latrina> Good morning guys, Anyone knows how can I decompress a vmlinuz? I need to PXEboot debian on my RPI4b though the vmlinuz is compressed and thus wont work from pxe
[14:11:06] <Latrina> I tried zcatting it out but it didn't work
[14:11:24] <pjb> IIRC, it's bzip2  no?

[14:11:50] <Latrina> pjb I am not sure 
[14:12:53] <nomad_dw> Latrina: try running `file` against your vmlinuz file, it should tell you what compression is being used.

[14:59:24] <ideclon-uk> Not quite sure why that didn’t send as a message…
[15:01:19] <ideclon-uk> The main difference between these two is that the export command makes the variable available to all the subsequent commands executed in that shell. The export attribute marks [the variable] for automatic export to the environment of the child processes created by the subsequent commands. … Let’s contrast this with the shell variable defined without export, which would be available only in that shell. Any child shells, 
[15:01:19] <ideclon-uk> processes, or subsequent commands can’t access it.

[18:16:27] <greycat> Khepra: it's a BSD thing, not a System V thing.

[18:49:10] <dpkg> apt is promoted over apt-get for interactive use. It uses fancy colors and has output format differences. It removes the .deb files that it downloads during an install or upgrade. It installs new packages during upgrades. apt-get has a stable command-line interface and is promoted for scripting.

[19:31:23] <greatcoof> n4dir: no thanks
[19:31:40] <somiaj> [twisti]: in general debian has no control over what any derivative does, and cannot track all their changes, policy differences, and so on.

[19:32:30] <n4dir> greatcoof: there is also lxde, uses the openbox window-manager, and i think even a kind-of-fork of it. Pretty light too, but xfce4, in my humble opinion, is more comfortable
[19:32:33] <somiaj> although some stuff is valid in the derivatives (The same could even be said about non debian-based distros), often times the debian solution can break a derivative and thus shouldn't be used.

[19:33:00] <Khepra> lxqt looks very nice too
[19:33:49] <n4dir> Khepra: on my usually lousy hardware xfce4 works well, Mate and Cinnamon, though both considered "light" rather not. So they are inbetween the heavy ones and the rather light ones. Really my opinion only. (and yes, i meant lxqt, i think. thanks)
[19:34:14] <amacater> For those with raspberry pi - on OFTC, there is a debian-raspberrypi channel - and you can install a rpi4 with pure Debian now more or less by adding Pete Batard's UEFI
[19:34:27] <Khepra> n4dir: methinks in the recent year the "lightweightness" has become less of a factor for all the "alternatives" to the big two, KDE and GNOME.
[19:34:42] <n4dir> Khepra: yes, sure. I didn't disagree. Just a sidenote
[19:35:06] <n4dir> it depends how light you need. But if you need really light, probably a WM is the better choice anyway
[19:35:24] <greatcoof> n4dir: any that are tiling by default or can be with a switch in 'settings'
[19:35:56] <n4dir> enlightenment can. if i recall correct. I wouldn't recommend it though (only if you look for fun with look and feel)
[19:35:56] <Khepra> to "truly" go light, if you don't need the functions and features of a DE (because being "lightweight" really means "no functions"), I'd go with a plain WM.   i3-wm that I like, or sway for wayland;  openbox isn't bad either.  r/unixporn has some REALLY neat themes that make those plain, ugly *boxes super beautiful.

[19:40:12] <n4dir> greatcoof: i for one am really bad with setting things up.

[22:16:01] <kodiak_f> Hi Folks, I've picked through the FHS 3.0 and still don't have a good idea where a shell user account that is solely for configuration management should be homed.  The tool is Ansible and I'd like to use a dedicated SSH account, that does NOT live within /home and is more in line with service accounts like 'puppet' which tend to be homed out of /var/lib/foo.  The difference with Ansible is the push model via SSH rather than being a 
[22:16:01] <kodiak_f> service account that runs as a daemon and pulls.  Tempted to create the home as /home/ansible or similar.
[22:16:01] <amacater> Or you can grep dmesg to find out which chipset you need and drop that in. It's more painful with video issues like Nvidia

[22:18:12] <kodiak_f> thanks amacater - I ruled out /srv based on my interpretation of the guidance in FHS3.0 where is states that this is the purpose:  "/srv contains site-specific data which is served by this system. "
[22:18:25] <greycat> I think the problem with post-installation firmware is there's no magical detection tool running that will grab what you need, like there is during the install.
[22:18:53] <kodiak_f> to be clear this'd be the homedir for the ansible user that is resident on hundreds of servers rather than the origin account on the controlnode
[22:19:09] <jhutchins> greycat: Yeah, you either install the kitchen sink, or do the manual process of identifying the hardware and tracking down the firmware.
