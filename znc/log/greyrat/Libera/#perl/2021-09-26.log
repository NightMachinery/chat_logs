[23:11:48] <mst> I wrote PerlX::AsyncAwait and Method::Signatures::PP and Babble using it
[23:12:19] <mst> so if you want inspiration for 'peak perl regexp batshittery', those modules between them should probably give you ideas

[23:13:27] <sasho> well the good thing about regex is that after some tinkering it normally starts working - with C++ with some tinkering it may not start working
[23:14:05] <mst> my experience of C and C++ is basically "wow, I got it to compile! ... SEGV"

[23:15:39] <sasho> haha exactly
[23:15:44] <sasho> you got the prime one
[23:17:59] <sasho> even if there is some not C++ backend but a C one - it may be useful - like pretty sure it would be easier to call C from Perl than C++
[23:19:15] <mst> I mean, my sole C-based cpan module actually has a line in it that's the C equivalent of 'die "I'm going to explode now because if I try to keep running I know a segfault will happen"'
[23:25:32] <sasho> maybe I just generate directly x86 asm in masm format
[23:25:41] <sasho> we'll see thanks for the answers
[23:27:26] <sasho> but even though I bash C++ - I'm also completely Perl noob wow
