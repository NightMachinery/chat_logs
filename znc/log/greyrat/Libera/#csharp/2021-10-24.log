[00:38:01] <bomb> Zimmer sucks, but he has a team of composers working for him.
[00:38:14] <MizMahem> hmm... I wonder what the best way to provide a Lazily generated exception.
[00:38:47] <MizMahem> for a method that does something like "If this fails, throw this exception" but I don't want to instance the exception unless and until it fails.
[00:39:34] <edcba> listening at miami vice now, 80s sucked less
[00:39:59] <edcba> maybe not for movie & songs but at least it was a good period lol
[00:40:05] <BtbN> I'm not sure I follow. Just... don't create an instance of the exception until then?

[00:44:40] <MizMahem> BtbN: sorry, I wasn't more clear. I want the exception type to be a generic parameter.
[00:44:51] <moose> bomb: My neighbor said I was doing "womens work" for even being at a desk. I think all of that is very outdated thinking and today society generally says "Fuck you" for talking like that.
[00:46:26] <MizMahem> I can do something like `(TException)(Activator.CreateInstance(typeof(TException), exceptionParams) ?? new TException())` specifying the `exceptionParams` in the signature, but this will probably require me to specify the type of the exception when calling the method, which is less desirable here.
[00:47:29] <bomb> moose: wat?

[00:48:08] <moose> MizMahem: I don't follow what you are trying to achieve. I read what you said you wanted, but why can't you just throw the exception inside of the condition that fails?
[00:48:14] <bomb> wtf are you talking about?
[00:48:34] <moose> bomb: Saying Python is "for women" and going on about "real men" etc
[00:49:12] <MizMahem> I could have the method provide me an `Func<TException> exceptionFactory` which lets me infer the exception type but now I'm allocating a delegate (not that big a deal I guess here) and providing such a lambda can be kinda messy when calling.
[00:49:29] <bomb> show me a man who writes Python, then...
[00:49:59] <moose> bomb: Funny enough, most Python developers are male.
[00:50:14] <MizMahem> moose: I want the type of the exception I call to be generic, so I can't easily know anything about how to construct it (aside from the `new()` constraint.)
[00:50:41] <bomb> being male does not make you a man.
[00:50:51] <moose> bomb: I'm not arguing with you.
[00:51:07] <moose> The reason we have this issue is people like you with exclusionary remarks keeping women and others from being included though.
[00:52:12] <bomb> keep parroting same Twitter rhetoric for another decade and we'll see how it helps
[00:52:59] <moose> The same people like you have been trying to exclude people for 100+ years.
[00:53:16] <moose> But look, women can vote and same sex couples can get married. Yeah, we'll see how it goes buddy.
[00:54:17] <moose> It's not Twitter rhetoric, it's change that is necessary. Why do you feel the need to stigmatize a programming language? Do you really have so little going for yourself that you wanna comment about how "woman like" someone is for their choice of language? rofl
[00:54:18] <moose> It's sad.
[00:54:30] <bomb> virtue signaling barely works on IRC where people have better things to do
[00:55:15] <bomb> taking a joke literally and framing me as I'm opposing women's vote rights or same sex marriage, is just laughable
[00:55:36] <moose> It's not a joke, it's like making a racist joke. It's a shit thing to do and is a form of oppression.
[00:56:27] <bomb> it has nothing to do with race, and you know it. but who cares, let's show us all your progressive features that makes you an awesome human being
[00:56:41] <moose> I am paralleling your sexist joke to a racist joke.
[00:56:47] <moose> I am not saying you made it about race.
[00:57:16] <moose> Progressive features?
[00:57:49] <moose> Maybe consider that other people here are not like you, they experience the world differently than you and might have different perspectives.
[00:58:41] <moose> MizMahem: Can you post a function or describe why you need generic exceptions?
[00:58:58] <moose> I am curious why you would need to make generic exceptions I guess. I've never done it, so maybe I am missing out.

[00:59:54] <MizMahem> here is a thing I am contemplating. https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/5vDypXvI/AggregateWhile.cs
[01:00:19] <moose> Ah, exciting
[01:00:53] <moose> This is why we let predicates generate exceptions and use AggregateException usually.
[01:01:29] <MizMahem> hmm, have the predicate generate an exception? Had not thought about that.
[01:01:40] <moose> The predicate has full context and knows what it needs to throw against and then your generic method can wrap it in AggregateException
[01:01:48] <MizMahem> wouldn't even need this method then really.
[01:01:55] <moose> That's how it done in TPL for example
[01:02:20] <MizMahem> that's a good idea, thanks.
[01:02:29] <moose> Most welcome.

[01:04:16] <MizMahem> hmm, it doesn't matter for what I'm writing, but I wonder what my out parameter will be when I throw an exception. I suppose it'll be whatever value it was when the exception was thrown I guess, which is valid, so far as it goes, for this.
[01:08:38] <moose> The general rule of thumb for out parameters in .NET has been "Do not use the parameter if the method returns false or if it generates an exception."
[01:08:45] <moose> So yeah that fits.
[01:17:21] <MizMahem> in the end I think I'm not going to use this method but a good thing to have in my back pocket for later.

[03:19:52] <Jong> Is there a name for the debate between "should I get this thing to work with unhappy cases? or put if statement checks blocking the unhappy case? or throw an exception on the unhappy case?"
[03:20:28] <Jong> The latest version of this debate appeared just now when I'm asking myself "should I make my logger class work when user does not supply a file name to write to?"
[03:21:16] <Jong> I could have an if statement around each logger call.   if ( logger file isn't a blank string ) { make some call to the logger }
[03:21:38] <Jong> alternatively I could make a string buffer when a logger file name isn't specified.  then I don't need all these damned if statements
[03:22:04] <MizMahem> I think methods should establish a contract, and throw if callers violate that contract

[05:54:37] <moose> C# question - is there a good pattern to async-ify portions of my code that are not async due to a library API? For example, sockets are async but they use an event driven model. I wnat to call a processing method that uses the data but would prefer to run it async on the inside. I want to avoid using Task.Result and such. Best practice here?
[05:54:58] <Nasp> gufi:  Not superior in the terms of performance
[05:55:02] <Nasp> Or chatting
[05:55:40] <moose> gufi: I was in the discord microsoft C# thing and it's just full of idiots tbh
[05:56:18] <moose> I really find that on Discord people are just super disruptive, trolling, or really not helpful. On IRC they're batshit crazy or super helpful generally so it's easy to pick up on.
[05:56:35] <moose> But like... I dunno. Higher brains are on IRC usually I feel like, generally.

[06:00:46] <gufi> for better or worse discord is more accessable... to ... younger... more dumb folk
[06:00:52] <moose> I agree.
[06:01:20] <moose> Discord is super accessible, great for gaming, it's nice that Slack has taken the useful things from it. It's also cool for other communities but I am very worried for the up and coming kiddos in tech.

[06:10:03] <moose> I have joined
[06:16:28] <Nasp> I hate discord
[06:16:31] <Nasp> And slack for chat
[06:16:34] <Nasp> It's awful
[06:16:44] <Nasp> Both have added threading, congrats, you've now turned it into a forum
[06:17:22] <Nasp> Also since Slack and Discord doesn't support having a list of favorite channels, it's impossible to follow discussions where you actually want to follow it
[06:22:02] <MizMahem> in a way it's kind of amazing. Like, I dunno. I'm kinda old, so my past is a bit of a distant memory, but I don't know if I was ever as bad at programming at some of the people I see with homework problems in discord.
[06:22:26] <Nasp> they should make channels for homework
[06:22:34] <MizMahem> Of course back in my day, there wasn't really any internet to learn from so you just kinda had to git good the hard way.
[06:22:36] <Nasp> Also people dont seem to get the help-1-2-3 channels
[06:22:38] <Nasp> It's a good idea
[06:22:46] <MizMahem> Reading from books and what not.
[06:22:47] <Nasp> But people have this idea that cross posting into all channels is best
[06:23:04] <MizMahem> (not that I ever got that good, but I mean... I dunno, I see lots of 101 problems)
[06:23:04] <Nasp> Like if help-1 is active people post in that, even though it would be easier to use inactive help-2
[06:23:23] <MizMahem> and oh dear god, does WinForms need to die.
[06:23:28] <MizMahem> I mean, why? Just why...
[06:24:20] <Nasp> Yeah that's the probelm they need to divide it, because most like a channel
[06:24:26] <Nasp> But helping people with how to write to console isn't great
[06:24:33] <Nasp> challenge*
[06:24:47] <MizMahem> yeah
[06:26:29] <MizMahem> whats sad to me is that these people are still so stuck when like receiving professional education. I dunno.
[06:27:14] <MizMahem> again, perhaps rosy retrospection on how well or not well I learned it but like, man, if you are struggling with figuring out how the structure of a loop or some shit works, I dunno man, maybe this programming this is not for you.
[06:27:22] <MizMahem> because it isn't going to get any easier from here.
[06:27:25] <Nasp>  Most on that discord also gave them the solution
[06:27:28] <Nasp> Just pasted iit
[06:27:45] <Nasp> Yeah i noticed a lot of basic stuff like how do i loop stuff
[06:28:03] <gufi> a vast majority are just trying to skate by on their homework
[06:28:09] <gufi> they're mostly gonna end up as college dropouts
[06:28:22] * MizMahem sighs.
[06:28:22] <gufi> sad truth... but not every one can hack this shit
[06:28:33] <Nasp> gufi:  Or even worse, your new collegue :D
[06:28:46] <gufi> faked it till they made it... better than most honestly
[06:29:00] <Nasp> I remember one of my fellow students asked in 3th semester what an if statement and integer was
[06:29:07] <Nasp> He's just been faking it
[06:29:31] <Nasp> Worse is the school i went to didn't care about programming skills, but only about how much you can talk about methodologies like scrum, xp, up and so on
[06:29:37] <gufi> there was a dude i went to school with that i literally could have paid my way through school off doing his hw for them
[06:29:51] <moose> Why didn't you?!
[06:30:03] <MizMahem> Well maybe it is like one of them math things. A thing I found with math is I never really understood a level of math until I went the next step up. Like, I could do arithmetic and stuff when I learned it. I could do the rules. But I never really understood it, I wasn't *proficient* at it until I started to do like algebra where arithmetic proficiency was required.
[06:30:03] <gufi> because gettign caught wasn't worth it
[06:30:07] <gufi> stupid people cant lie good
[06:30:11] <moose> Oh, you could get caught.
[06:30:13] <moose> Yeah.
[06:30:15] <moose> Forgot about that.
[06:30:48] <Nasp> Regarding that discord in general dev communities are quite hostile
[06:30:56] <Nasp> Or any kind of tech
[06:30:56] <MizMahem> And in the same sense, I never really understood algebra, or at least, wasn't really proficient at it until I had to do calculus which required algebra proficiency to be successful.
[06:31:02] <Nasp> I'm on a few other cancer discord servers
[06:31:06] <MizMahem> So maybe programming is like that.
[06:31:49] <Nasp> Gotta use it to learn it
[06:32:31] <MizMahem> yeah
[06:35:13] <MizMahem> although it also makes me worry about how they are teaching people. Like I know a lot of this is basic stuff, but I dunno, it feels like you should be learning best practice from the ground up, even if that is a little bit more complex or difficult.
[06:35:29] <MizMahem> Because if you learn lazy "easy" ways to do it, you'll just have to unlearn those patterns later anyways.
[06:35:40] <Nasp> Problem is most teachers are fuck old
[06:35:46] <Nasp> So best practice is what's best practice for 20+ years ago
[06:36:43] <MizMahem> and also, man, there are not NEARLY enough `enum`s in this code. Far far to little.

[07:04:44] <MizMahem> hmm... does my decision to make these objects records still make sense. I'm not sure. Comparing them doesn't really make sense, but if you did compare them, I suppose they should have value-based equality. Since two of these objects with the same key should be the same... hmm...
[07:05:54] <MizMahem> The deal is, instances of these objects should probably be singletons. I don't know of a good pattern to enforce or like, point that way.
[07:08:26] <MizMahem> hmm, well I suppose handling that kind of logic is up a step from the objects themselves, which really shouldn't know or care how many instances of them exist.
[07:10:01] <MizMahem> but, hmm... what does the fact that I want these objects to be singletons tell me about their equality. I guess I don't really know the answer to that. I suppose it means I want value type equality. All objects with the same values should be equal since they should be interchangeable. Which I guess means records remains the correct choice.
[07:10:27] <MizMahem> and I suppose there is no real cost in having an abstract parent record that isn't very record like, since it can't be instance anyways.

[07:42:33] <Nasp> MizMahem:  That's quite simple, make the ctor private and use static fields / properties for the different types
[07:43:57] <MizMahem> Nasp: mmm, but I want users to be able to construct these objects as well. I will use something like that pattern for my predefined types though.
[07:44:41] <MizMahem> I suppose I could make some sort of type factory that gets called and checks to see if it already has an instance and gives that instead...
[07:44:48] <MizMahem> but that sounds like a lot of work.
[07:46:40] <MizMahem> honestly I suppose I won't worry about it to much really. You shouldn't need to make extra types, but I guess if you want to, that's on you. I'll make getting singletons of my types easy, but if you want to do something stupid, that's on you.
[07:46:47] <MizMahem> I guess I'll ponder a factor method though.

[07:56:27] <ekh> Hello
[07:58:17] <ekh> So, I've found out the hard way that linq List.RemoveAll() actually replaces the element with null. Is another way to remove an element and reduce the list size? (I am currently doing List = List.Where(..).ToList())
[08:00:51] <gufi> thats the way
[08:01:40] <gufi> that or use a for loop and remove ensuring that when it passes the if check that you dont increment because you need to stay on that index since it's the next one
[08:09:23] <moose> Singletons :O
[08:18:51] <moose> I thought I was about to be cool and invent the new ridiculous design pattern called the "doubleton" and apparently this guy already did it.

[09:02:46] <MizMahem> well I mean, like with any pattern there is a place for it.
[09:03:32] <MizMahem> Like here, these objects represent transformations. So for any object of a given set of values, there should really only be one instance of it, because any other instance would just be equivalent to it.
[09:04:11] <MizMahem> Nothing *wrong* per se about having another instance, there just isn't any point. It would be less efficient.
