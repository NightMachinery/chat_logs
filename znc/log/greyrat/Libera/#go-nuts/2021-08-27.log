[02:03:34] <b0nn> For example, var randInt = rand.Int ; # that's in your package, then in your function you might have a callto randInt, then in your test you assign a function that generates precisely the error you want to randInt (this test has to be in the same package as your SUT)
[02:04:23] <b0nn> Thus when that test runs, your fake randInt function generates the impossible error, and your error trap is activaed

[02:27:40] <b0nn> Not that I know off the top of my heasd if 0 is a legitimate return from rand.Int()
[02:29:40] <Seirdy> tysm, b0nn!
[02:31:34] <Seirdy> well, i meant that there is some code that's only reachable if un-exported functions receive certain params, but those functions are only called in such a way that those params are never passed; however, i don't exactly want to remove those tests since they're a good bug-check so i replaced them with panics
[02:31:42] <Seirdy> and if the panic is ever reached it means there's a bug
[02:32:35] <b0nn> Heh, you can still test those conditions, by writing tests that are in the same package
[02:32:39] <Seirdy> i currently use the coverage artifacts to see what lines aren't covered, and i mentally exclude lines that contain "log.Panicf". was wondering if anyone has a similar approach.
[02:32:45] <Seirdy> b0nn: yeah i know that's an option
[02:32:55] <b0nn> You will need to fake panic though to prevent it taking your tests down
[02:32:58] <Seirdy> i tend to prefer integration tests tho

[02:35:05] <Seirdy> so avoiding private imports, except for situations where it can help build test cases with big generated struct params.

[18:36:28] <fizzie> Just to nitpick a little, those aren't two alternative options: you *have* to use `Start` first if you want to use `Wait` in the first place. `Run` is the end-to-end convenience utility that both starts the spawned process *and* waits for it to finish.

[20:10:36] <Tv_> generally, you'd pick either make B authenticate using A as the backend, or
[20:10:49] <saml> i guess one clean way is to create a single source login/account system and migrate all other systems into that

[20:11:07] <saml> yeah

[20:13:27] <Tv_> siXy: in the sense that enterprise IT is doomed to suck, yes
[20:13:27] <saml> let's say I built single universal auth thingy. But youtube wants to maintain its own premium membership program, while google drive also wants to maintain their own.  The auth system shouldn't be concerned with payments/memberships right?

[20:15:15] <saml> I guess auth should be about email/username + password only. Maybe basic profile info such as first/last name. And youtube premium and google drive may talk to my universal auth and implement their own extended user profile (memberships and other extension)
[20:15:48] <saml> or stop merging companies
[20:17:00] <siXy> saml: You'd usually accomplish that in an LDAP+krb world by adding LDAP attributes to describe the various bits that thingA and thingB want to add alongside the basic user info.

[21:09:06] <das_j> Hey everyone, is there a way to access the base of a type when the type itself is not public? Essentially, the crypto library does something like `type ed25519PublicKey ed25519.PublicKey` which in turn is just a []byte. I want to access the byte array but I cannot cast it, the error message being `pubKey (variable of type ssh.PublicKey) cannot have dynamic type []byte (missing method Marshal)`
[21:10:26] <das_j> This is essentially what I'm doing: https://play.golang.org/p/BPX99FyXjCa

[21:13:36] <Tv_> das_j: you have Marshal that hands back the []byte?
[21:14:08] <das_j> It hands back []byte but not the correct ones. Instead of just dumping the public key, the key gets encoded in the SSH wire protocol
