[01:56:56] <drobilla> ^
[01:57:22] <saltysoul> those are *bold* words! tempting :thinking:
[01:57:26] <drobilla> I switched to the Advantage many years ago, now on (much less ergonomically good) Ergodoxen.  It is not exaggerating at all to say this saved my career
[01:57:37] <ignaloidas> I feel like keyboards only really matter if you
[01:57:46] <ignaloidas> 're reaching over 80 wpm
[01:58:08] <ignaloidas> which if we believe statistics is like 1% of people
[01:58:13] <technomancy> I was filling this out in my head as "if you type" and , well, I was close
[01:58:20] <drobilla> It was more about pinky modifiers being an RSI nightmare for me
[01:58:21] * shapr laughs
[01:58:22] *** Joins: southclaws (~quassel@212.82.91.46)
[01:58:37] <shapr> OH: Q: Did you just port agda input mode to your keyboard firmware? A: I'm just adding some common ones
[01:58:45] <drobilla> (Don't know how fast I was typing then, but well over 80 WPM for plain text now, if that matters)
[01:58:47] <technomancy> RSI isn't really well understood in terms of what can cause it to strike
[01:58:53] <technomancy> it's unpredictable
[01:59:35] <technomancy> I would say taking frequent breaks is probably better advice than "just type slower" tho
[01:59:51] <ignaloidas> I know that I start to experience symptoms of it when I keep my hands in the same position for a long time
[02:00:21] <saltysoul> haha I agree that frequent breaks is probably the best advice rather than typing slower
[02:00:41] <ignaloidas> so in that sense split keyboard probably might not make sense for me
[02:00:43] <c355E3B> shapr, no I have friends who are
[02:01:03] <c355E3B> Also do you think that I would fall in the junior bucket?
[02:01:17] <shapr> c355E3B: don't know, but you asked that question?
[02:01:40] <saltysoul> talking about keyboards - has anyone used the MacBook Pro touchbar? I find it very unpleasent ;/
[02:01:41] <ignaloidas> saltysoul, technomancy: I did not mean to advise typing slower, I just meant that keyboard itself doesn't really make a difference in typing speed bellow a certain speed
[02:01:53] <technomancy> ignaloidas: that's the other thing about RSI is that it's a group of related symptoms so it's very common for different causes to get treated the same way even when different treatments are needed
[02:02:19] <saltysoul> ignaloidas: ah gotcha! thanks for clarifying
[02:02:40] <technomancy> ignaloidas: I see; I'm thinking about it from a perspective of comfort and health rather than productivity
[02:03:00] <c355E3B> Right. To clarify what I’m asking is if your company is currently hiring juniors because I would rather pass my friend recommendations at places to apply to which aren’t soul sucking or terrible.
[02:03:07] <ignaloidas> technomancy, true, similar to other chronic pains. it's hard to figure out a cause for a symptom when it could be any of a ton of different things

[02:04:43] <ignaloidas> I was wondering though on how well a steno keyboard work for programming
[02:06:09] <ignaloidas> I know that there have been "keyboards" with 10 keys where each character is chorded, but it could be a lot more efficient to chord whole keywords and stuff if programming
[02:06:25] <saltysoul> ignaloidas: on first look probably not very useful for programming. we usually use so many special chars.
[02:06:27] *** Quits: kinduff (~kinduff@user/kinduff) (Ping timeout: 264 seconds)
[02:06:35] <saltysoul> but i might be wrong lol
[02:07:14] <drobilla> Typing speed doesn't seem like it'd be a bottleneck for programming very often anyway
[02:07:18] <ignaloidas> saltysoul, dunno about you, but I program in python, a lot less special characters than in other languages it seems
[02:08:09] <technomancy> chording gets a bad reputation because laptop manufacturers put the fn key in the worst possible position
[02:08:21] <drobilla> I have tried some things like putting ( and ) on their own dedicated keys which would clearly be better than shifting them all the time, but never managed to switch my habits over to actually using them (never forced it, I try to keep as much transferrable muscle memory to standard keyboards as possible)
[02:08:26] <technomancy> well, I guess that's less chording and more layering
[02:08:31] <jkaye> Ergonomics are important, but I think one of the best things to do for rsi is work out/lift weights. Doesn't have to be anything crazy, but my 100% anecdata is that people who do work out don't have any issues while those who are less active may
[02:08:32] <technomancy> anyway if you put it somewhere sensible then layering is great
[02:08:45] <saltysoul> ignaloidas: my main language is python as well hahaha
[02:08:46] <drobilla> Hard agree on layering.  Layer modifiers *under your thumbs* is a complete game changer
[02:09:17] <technomancy> like I didn't even bother mapping the number row on my ergodox once I got used to the layered numpad
[02:09:25] <technomancy> it's just so much more comfortable and fast to do it on a layer

[18:38:40] <jj5> did you see that thing about the strlen() as hash function..?
[18:38:52] <jjuran> Yes :-)
[18:38:55] <companion_cube> what are you even supposed to use that for, actually?
[18:39:47] <wink> jjuran: you're joking, but it's not as bad. there are only 2, real and nonreal :P
[18:39:50] <jj5> companion_cube: you use mysqli_real_escape_string() in PHP to escape single quote characters "'" in your SQL...
[18:40:06] <wink> mysqli_ is a prefix from before-namespace-times
[18:40:08] <companion_cube> yes but you shouldn't need that, right?
[18:40:23] <wink> well you need it in a world before prepared statements
[18:40:26] <jj5> companion_cube: correct, you should use parameters
[18:40:43] <wink> we're talking about a 2020? 2021? book that could have been written in 2005
[18:40:46] <wink> the world has moved on
[18:40:49] <companion_cube> right! so it's kind of a non problem
[18:41:02] <companion_cube> the kind that should have a big fat deprecation warning
[18:41:05] <jjuran> If you're serious about not getting SQL-injected, you use `?` substitution in the API instead of trying to render the input safe.
[18:41:58] <jj5> unfortunately I haven't found a way to use LIMIT without string manipulation
[18:42:14] <jj5> but calling intval() on your LIMIT criteria is fairly safe
[18:42:22] <jjuran> i.e. what everyone else said while I was busy typing :-)
[18:42:47] <companion_cube> if you control the limit and know it's an int, should be ok

[19:00:41] <wink> sure there's a million better hashes
[19:01:00] <companion_cube> there's hashes writabe in 4 lines that are 100x better
[19:01:09] <wink> but it also could be worse, like sorting all your local users in the 192. prefix bucket

[22:36:49] <shapr> c355E3B: we can easily use more than that
[22:37:43] <c355E3B> I think what’s happening is Falcon is trying to scan shit in kernel space, it then fails to allocate a buffer large enough to look at memory and dies
[22:37:54] <c355E3B> And since you died in kernel space you kill the laptop
[22:38:17] <shapr> huh

[22:42:06] <wink> I don't remember how many issues I found on day one and then we didn't have to get antivirus.
[22:42:33] <shapr> c355E3B: falcon rules are written in Haskell, so I bet that wouldn't work
[22:42:44] <shapr> not the engine itself, but the rules part

[22:43:39] <zbrown[m]> Falcon is an EDR (record every process and network activity) sensor and it’s a clown shoes implementation of one.
[22:44:12] <zbrown[m]> They’re notorious for slowing down builds on dev laptops or like crashing machines
