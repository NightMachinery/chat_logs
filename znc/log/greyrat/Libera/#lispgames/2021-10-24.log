[01:57:05] <technomancy> peterhil: it's also an alchemy game played on a hex grid, by Zachtronics
[01:57:16] <technomancy> (creators of spacechem, infinifactory, TIS-100)
[01:57:27] <peterhil> Ok, maybe I have to check it out after I finish this.
[01:58:56] <technomancy> all their games are great
[02:00:49] <technomancy> they do this ridiculous thing for puzzle games which I love where they make all their levels in any random order and then they give them to beta testers and they record how long they take to solve, sort by that order, and then bam; that's the order they go in the game.
[02:01:02] <technomancy> (plus some levels which are created specifically to teach new mechanics)
[02:02:46] <peterhil> technomancy: Great example of user testing done right!
[02:03:09] <technomancy> my kids keep finding bugs in my game because they do weird things that I don't do, like ... push buttons when the game is not accepting input
[02:04:04] <peterhil> I also have some persistent bugs related to movements and calculating the hex positions. Maybe I need to find simpler and more robust way to calculate them.

[02:56:40] <peterhil> technomancy: Do you mean this? https://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/
[02:58:01] <peterhil> In my game, the player moves in polar coordinates (that are rounded, and that must be the source of bugs), and the cells are on a hexagonal grid with every other row offset.
[02:59:13] <peterhil> dto: OMG! As a technohead myself, I approve! Can not wait to see this in colours!
[02:59:36] <peterhil> Is there going to be a stroboscope or UV light effects?
[02:59:36] <pjb> peterhil: modify it to keep the polar coordinates, with floats (not rounded), and a micro-grid.  If you don't get the exact same coordinates, you're not in the same "cell".
[02:59:47] <technomancy> peterhil: nah this one https://zachtronics.com/opus-magnum/
[02:59:49] <dto> peterhil: awesome to see your project progressing, thanks for your comments ! will do!
[02:59:51] <technomancy> oh wait
[02:59:58] <technomancy> yes, that one, haha
[03:02:27] <peterhil> technomancy: I watched the trailer for Opus Magnum, and I think I have try it! The trailer reminded me og this Aphex Twin video for some reason: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38RMZ9H7Cg8
[03:04:15] <peterhil> pjb: I do not quite get what you are suggesting – can you elaborate?
[03:07:06] *** Joins: rtypo (~alex@user/rtypo)
[03:08:25] <pjb> peterhil: it's difficult to jump to a specific xy coordinates when you use polar coordinates.
[03:08:46] <pjb> Notably if you use floats to number the cells…
[03:09:40] <peterhil> pjb: Yeah, that is true! Maybe I have to think about it overnight. Thanks!
[03:10:27] <pjb> peterhil: so I imagine personage that are close, but that have difficulty in interacting, because they can't reach their specific coordinates.
[03:11:30] <peterhil> dto: That one dancing character reminds me of ‘Hillul’ (a jubilating man), the original letter that was written for semitic ‘He’ and which developed to our E letter through greek Epsilon: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E#History
[03:16:28] <peterhil> I learnt the Hebrew alphabet recently, and so my surprise the Proto–Sinaitic and Paleo–Hebrew alphabets are really close to Phoenician alphabet (which in turn is not so different from greek), so that helped learning because I knew greek alphabet. The development of various writing systems is really interesting.
[03:17:37] <peterhil> pjb: Thanks, maybe I need to try some visualisation or experiment with pen and paper, Matlab or Geogebra.
[03:18:22] <peterhil> s/Matlab/Matplotlib/ and Numpy
[03:20:27] <peterhil> Now I found how to replicate the bug – it needs at least three buttons simultaneously pressed, and the the sum of those movements in polar coordinated do not match the hex grid anymore.
[03:22:55] <peterhil> Also, the map needs to wrap around for the bug to occur.

[19:07:36] <mfiano> IMPORTANT MESSAGE TO THOSE THAT ARE PARTICIPATING IN THE JAM
[19:08:02] <thrig> HENCEFORTH WE SHALL CHANNEL THE SPIRIT OF AOL
[19:08:05] <mfiano> Be sure the follow the rule that states you must submit a source archive in ZIP or tarball format. It is not enough to link to a source repo.
[19:08:14] <borodust> D:
[19:08:35] <borodust> welll
[19:08:36] <dthompson> mfiano: how do you do that?
[19:08:46] <mfiano> Use the itch.io submission process
[19:08:57] <mfiano> Rather than just writing a description with a link :)
[19:09:15] <dthompson> okay hopefully that will all be obvious when I go to submit
[19:09:26] <borodust> maybe that was a too harsh move, maybe a warning would suffice
[19:09:31] <mfiano> This is to freeze the version and have a secondary host (itch) for future sake
[19:10:04] <dthompson> yeah makes sense
[19:10:05] <mfiano> Too many old repos from past jams are no longer reachable. The point of the jam is for newcomers to be able to download and tweak existing games to learn
[19:10:37] <borodust> well, the question is then what sources should be included
[19:10:48] <borodust> everything so thing builds?
[19:10:59] <borodust> or only part made during the jam
[19:11:17] <borodust> builds often depend on external sources
[19:11:48] <borodust> even if sources are availble, there's little guarantee it will build in a year
[19:11:54] <mfiano> Only the latter is required. If it is a modification of an existing game, a patch or the modified version in full will do. You do not need to include any shared libraries or frameworks like lua love
[19:12:07] <mfiano> Instructions on how to build are always welcome though
[19:12:34] <borodust> like, i submit a thing that depends on an alpha version of framework
[19:12:39] <borodust> it won't build in a month :)
[19:12:59] <borodust> but alright
[19:13:05] <borodust> any sources is better than none
[19:13:12] <mfiano> Well it doesn't have to build. Being able to see the source is enough to learn. Most of the entries didn't even link to a repo...they just included binary downloads!
[19:13:20] <mfiano> How are we to even know it was made with Lisp?
[19:14:20] <borodust> that's a clear violation, yes, and it's against the very idea 
[19:14:39] <borodust> but if there was a link, well, maybe ppl just missed there should be a source archive
[19:16:36] <mfiano> I might have over re-acted, but every jam, the majority of submissions are either not even written in Lisp or they don't include the source to be able to tell. I think next jam I am going to modify the jam description to make it very clear what the purpose of the jam is for, and how submissions need to be made to accomplish that.
[19:16:57] <mfiano> It is just a bit frustrating when you have to remove so many entries eveyr jam for not being lisp (or provably lisp).
[19:17:35] <shoshin> yeah like... why even submit something if you're not going to Lisp?
[19:17:44] <shoshin> i feel you
[19:18:39] <mfiano> The main purpose of the jam is to attract newcomers to Lisp. The rules let you use any past submissions as a base to tweak and learn.
[19:19:12] <mfiano> If the source isn't available by browsing itch.io or if it's not even Lisp, then that doesn't work :)
[19:19:34] <mfiano> Also third-party links expire. Repos can be marked private, deleted, etc. Submissions to itch cannot
[19:19:55] <thrig> (unless itch goes away)
[19:20:10] <mfiano> True. I try to backup all submissions locally for that case
[19:20:31] <mfiano> In the future I'd like to have a lispgames.org web app that the community maintains
[19:20:41] <mfiano> But that is a lot of work when itch works fine for now
[19:20:43] <shoshin> could put them on archive.org
[19:29:07] <technomancy> FWIW all my games have the source available inside the game itself while you're playing them, but I still think it's not a bad idea to require a source tarball

[19:30:59] <technomancy> no, I think it's a good idea
[19:31:06] <mfiano> I really want newcomers to have a wide array of active links to downloads to choose from
[19:31:35] <technomancy> makes sense
[19:32:04] <technomancy> but also: more games should have the source available and editable from inside the game =D it's the lisp way!
[19:32:27] <mfiano> :D
[19:33:26] <shoshin> +1
[19:34:18] <technomancy> can you build a CL game that bundles hemlock or ... one of those CL ports of Emacs I wonder?
[19:34:36] <mfiano> I think having a list of all zip/tarballs on one of our community owned server would be worthwhile also, as another backup, and easier to navigate
[19:34:47] <mfiano> From all past jams
[19:34:59] <technomancy> wonder how good the itch.io API is
[19:35:16] <technomancy> from what I know of the people making it I would guess better than any of the alternatives =)
[19:35:59] <mfiano> I don't know. I do want to make the LGJs more explorable. As of right now you need to know the link to each jam, which the wiki just got edited to add as many as we know about.
[19:36:06] <mfiano> So thoughts for next jam
[19:37:00] <mfiano> Also would be nice to have a co-organizer for next jam. I vote for the one person always here for jam time: technomancy :)

[21:29:29] <mfiano> Like, you can publish a binary release that way. All we are asking is if the source is also published on itch.io's download hosting for persistence and easy to locate instead of following links to repositories that may have been marked private or changed since the submission was published
[21:30:06] <mfiano> You can also include the source code in the same download as the binary if you wish. Only requirement is the source be available with a free license :)

[21:31:41] <mfiano> This also makes it easier for the organizers and people that want to play a game. For organizers (just me currently, but looking to expand), we can just hit every game page and download the zip/tarball and add it to an archive incase itch.io is ever discontinued
[21:32:24] <mfiano> In the future I'd like to have a large list of download links on a single page we control, with descriptions etc...making discoverability easier
