[04:45:44] <ThePendulum> at the time I set her up for a 7GB 200min/sms contract

[04:54:38] <evilgohan2> wow. I forgot about those kinda plans
[04:54:45] <evilgohan2> I've had unlimited text/talk for so long
[04:55:01] <evilgohan2> I don't wanna ever go back to the old days of getting nickle/dimed (literally) per SMS / minute of talk
[04:55:21] <evilgohan2> I remember back in high school where someone I knew got a $400 bill one month because of how many texts that he sent
[04:55:41] <ThePendulum> most people don't really use traditional cell calls much, and SMS basically never, so you can usually save a few euros getting a limited call/sms plan
[04:55:50] <ThePendulum> over here anyway
[04:55:57] <evilgohan2> so what, just mostly use WhatsApp, Signal, Telegram?
[04:56:05] <ThePendulum> yeah
[04:56:25] <evilgohan2> Sounds a bit reliant, no? Like, if the apps aren't available, then what?
[04:56:34] <ThePendulum> the unlimited plan is 3eu more expensive, however since she didn't use any data she could go back from 7GB to 5GB, and overall it would even be 1 euro cheaper
[04:56:42] <evilgohan2> I mean, technically, it's far more secure than SMS, but I still.
[04:56:51] <evilgohan2> would just be concerned about availability /lockin
[04:56:58] <evilgohan2> (also, I don't trust Facebook so WhatsApp is a no for me)
[04:57:11] <ThePendulum> use another app, and if that fails, /then/ use sms?
[04:57:19] <evilgohan2> I guess.
[04:57:29] <ThePendulum> it's pretty unlikely you are suddenly going to nee 200 texts in a pinch
[04:57:32] <ThePendulum> *need
[04:57:38] <evilgohan2> Trying to get Americans to do that is impossible. The company is hell and you still can't get people off of Facebook / Insta / whatsapp
[04:57:47] <ThePendulum> in such an event it would affect everyone and I'm sure the providers will offer some sort of deal
[04:58:18] <evilgohan2> From what I see of people constantly sim swapping in the EU, I figured mobility was just ubiquitous there and prices were decent.
[04:58:24] <evilgohan2> I guess that wasn't an accurate assumption?
[04:59:03] <ThePendulum> I guess we pay less for data? what would you expect to pay for 5GB data and unlimited cell?
[04:59:05] <evilgohan2> or is it more nuanced?
[04:59:07] <evilgohan2> Ah
[04:59:34] <evilgohan2> Well, I'm on a plan right now wherein we're splitting service between two of us. $90 a month - flat. Taxes / Fees included in that.
[04:59:49] <ThePendulum> that's unlimited everything or?
[04:59:51] <evilgohan2> Unlimited talk / text / "data" (though it gets throttled under certain conditions after 55GiB
[04:59:54] <ThePendulum> right
[05:00:04] <evilgohan2> 5GB data outside the USA
[05:00:10] <ThePendulum> is that with or without a device
[05:00:29] <evilgohan2> Tethered devices get 20GiB of data at full speed.
[05:00:35] <evilgohan2> then throttled thereafter
[05:00:41] <ThePendulum> I mean does that include a loan on your phone
[05:00:46] <ThePendulum> or sim only
[05:00:49] <evilgohan2> Oh, no.
[05:00:54] <evilgohan2> We bought our phones outright
[05:01:13] <ThePendulum> so the most expensive plan I can select with the provider my sister and I use
[05:01:13] <evilgohan2> They did give us a gift card on sign-up though... and gave us like $200 each for some Note 4s
[05:01:17] <evilgohan2> ...in 2019.
[05:02:08] <ThePendulum> for €29/mo you get unlimited everything, 5G, and can cancel monthly
[05:02:19] <evilgohan2> Carriers here don't do "free" devices anymore. You either pay as a loan, or it's coming out of you one way or annother. So I just pay out of pocket
[05:02:22] <rawktucc> north america runs on SMS
[05:02:23] <ThePendulum> if you get a 2 year contract for 4G you can pay €25/mo
[05:02:25] <evilgohan2> Oh, and that also includes insurance.
[05:02:35] <evilgohan2> and they're paying for Netflix
[05:02:47] <ThePendulum> you can get a discount if you have another person at the address using that provider
[05:03:06] <ThePendulum> so I guess we pay about half as much
[05:03:14] <evilgohan2> So, for $45 for each of us out of pocket per month for technically unlimited everything + Netflix on them, yeah, I'm ok with it.
[05:03:18] *** Quits: GWM (~GWM@user/gwm) (Ping timeout: 268 seconds)
[05:03:42] <ThePendulum> my sister's plan is €17/mo for 5GB unlimited calls/texts, cancel monthly, it would be €15 for 2 years
[05:03:46] <ThePendulum> 15/mo that is
[05:04:07] <evilgohan2> See no neeed to cancel this tbh.
[05:04:21] <evilgohan2> Supposed to include in-flight unlimited wi-fi as well. Yeah, uh... I'm not getting on a plane anytime soon lol
[05:04:26] <evilgohan2> ,wa €17 usd
[05:04:27] <ThePendulum> the $45 is what my sister was paying for her phone use as a fine, lol
[05:04:28] <unfinity> 04Result $19.26 14(US dollars) 14(December 28, 2021) 06| 04Input convert €17 14(euros) to US dollars
[05:04:37] <ThePendulum> so yeah it's probably fine for the US but we definitely don't get shafted over here in comparison
[05:04:47] <evilgohan2> Yeah seems reasonable.
[05:05:14] <evilgohan2> when it's worth it, I may look into a 5G device
[05:05:20] <evilgohan2> S9+ getting kinda long in the tooth.
[05:05:25] <evilgohan2> But I like having a headphone hack,.
[05:05:27] <evilgohan2> jack*
[05:05:34] <ThePendulum> headphone jack is my primary search term now as well
[05:05:53] <ThePendulum> and I'm not someone that will love it when they try it, because my current phone doesn't have one, and I've had it for 3 years
[05:06:22] <evilgohan2> S9+ released in 2018. It's almost 2022. Keep that in mind lol
[05:06:44] <evilgohan2> Still getting security updates from OEM though which is nice
[05:07:07] <ThePendulum> age-wise I could've used my phone for another 3 years easily, but it just has too many nuiseances
[05:07:27] <ThePendulum> I guess I could address some of them installing a custom rom
[05:07:28] <evilgohan2> My old Note 4 was well beyond its last legs when I got the S9+
[05:07:44] <evilgohan2> Them giving me $200 for it was all the incentive I needed.
[05:07:57] <evilgohan2> Especially since they were going for $50 on eBay at the time.
[05:08:15] <evilgohan2> Now, though, phones just keep costing more and more with less and less features it seems
[05:08:38] <rawktucc> embrace buying used phones with good lineageOS support
[05:08:42] <evilgohan2> like, refurb S21 Ultras are $850+
[05:08:48] <ThePendulum> does seem the price of flagships has stabilized a little bit, but yeah, feature-wise I feel my S3 peaked in 2012
[05:08:49] <rawktucc> and if you're using apps that need safetynet or Google Services... rethink your phone
[05:09:06] <ThePendulum> the only new feature I actually like is the under screen fingerprint scanner
[05:09:11] <evilgohan2> sorry, but I'm locked into Google Services. I use GSuite personally and for work.
[05:10:03] <ThePendulum> I would consider a used phone if they used a screen protector and the battery is easily replaceable
[05:10:56] <ThePendulum> I should move away from gmail but I'm not really sure what to

[05:11:18] <Hydragyrum> rip
[05:11:36] <evilgohan2> battery replaceability has gone out the window
[05:11:51] <evilgohan2> I have a S6A here which still works okay, and its battery bloated
[05:11:56] <evilgohan2> but the battery isn't user replaceable.
[05:12:15] <ThePendulum> fastmail looks alright, I should probably set it up with my own domain so it's easier to switch in the future
[05:12:28] <ThePendulum> if it can do that
[05:12:29] <evilgohan2> I used to run my own email server years ago
[05:12:37] <evilgohan2> I also have run email servers profesionally for a living
[05:12:54] <ThePendulum> I could probably figure that out, but literally everything else hinges on my email address and I'm not /that/ confident lol
[05:13:00] <evilgohan2> As soon as Google Apps for domains came out and it was free, I jumped right over.
[05:13:02] <evilgohan2> Fuck it.

[05:15:00] <evilgohan2> used to do that with my S2. It was great. Can't do that anymore.
[05:15:14] <Hurricane> my laptop, a Toughbook CF-53  takes 10 seconds max assuming it's already off
[05:15:35] <evilgohan2> lol, good luck with that on a MacBook 
[05:15:47] <Hurricane> Replacing batteries is still there you just have to look for it before you buy.

[05:20:18] <ThePendulum> contemplating if I should pay €4/mo to use a custom domain with protonmail. probably right, gotta give them something in return for not shoving ads down my throat
[05:20:33] <Hurricane> I actually got my work laptop today
[05:20:39] <Hurricane> didn't boot or look at it yet
[05:20:40] <ThePendulum> and if I regret that, having a custom domain means I don't have to update every single fucking account I ever made again
[05:21:03] <Hurricane> I checked the IO, realized it wouldn't work with my CRT (no VGA) and put it back in the case
[05:21:21] <Hurricane> I don't even know what company made it lol

[05:43:54] <evilgohan2> lol, I use a newer gTLD at that for my email
[05:44:08] <evilgohan2> people usually expect me to follow with ".com" or ".net" or something
[05:44:13] <evilgohan2> and always ask "is that it?"
[05:44:19] <evilgohan2> I'm like: "Yeah"
[05:44:25] <evilgohan2> just wait till I score "sh.in"
[05:46:21] <Hurricane> I've always been interested in being my own email provider, how well has that worked for you guys?
[05:46:27] <evilgohan2> gah, registry.in doesn't allow less than 3 chars
[05:46:42] <evilgohan2> Hurricane: Seriously. I say this having done email for a living.
[05:46:43] <evilgohan2> Don't.
[05:47:14] <Hurricane> ok
[05:47:18] <evilgohan2> Find a reputable managed provider and let them do it for you.
[05:47:19] <Hurricane> good to know
[05:47:26] <evilgohan2> O365. Google. Use whatever makes you happy.
[05:47:30] <evilgohan2> Just. Don't run your own.

[09:47:55] <Hydragyrum> they've been known to comply with law enforcement at least once, which shows that they keep certain information (at least logging IPs, which iirc was the only info besides basic metadata involved)
[09:48:32] <Hydragyrum> if you're extra concerned about security/privacy (i.e. maybe a bit paranoid) maybe go elsewhere, but other than that they're fine
[09:50:10] <ThePendulum> it seems the next best thing is Fastmail, which is located in Australia and which I'd expect to succumb to that kind of pressure much more often towards the future 
[09:50:33] <Hydragyrum> yeah it's not easy to find ones that are good about that
[09:51:33] <evilgohan2> lol
[09:51:41] <evilgohan2> if you think .au providers won't give info
[09:51:42] <Hydragyrum> however, if keeping your identity hidden from government actors isn't a big deal, proton's probably fine
[09:51:49] <evilgohan2> you're in for a big disappointment
[09:51:59] <evilgohan2> .nz and .au will hand right over to .us and .uk without a momnet's hesitation
[09:52:53] <ThePendulum> evilgohan2: I'm saying they are more likely to 
[09:53:01] <Hydragyrum> lol I might trust a .au that hasn't been known to do it in the past over someone who has, but not by much

[10:05:24] <evilgohan2> But they can be affected by the reputation of the provider you go with
[10:05:32] <evilgohan2> So... if protonmail is used by a lot of scammers / spammers
[10:05:45] <evilgohan2> your domain will get associated with that, and down the chute your reputation goes.
[10:06:27] <evilgohan2> I've configured brand new domains for clients before, sent an email through them, and had them immediately go to spam because their IPs were dog shit

[10:45:59] <evilgohan2> Yes.
[10:47:51] <evilgohan2> I have an older email from a site that hasn't been online with anything more than a A record pointing to a hard redirect, and an MX record just to keep it receiving mail.
[10:48:03] <evilgohan2> oh, and an SPF / DMARC / DKIM record to restrict sending.
[10:48:11] <evilgohan2> But I haven't sent a single message from it in like... 9 years
[10:48:34] <evilgohan2> It still gets emails though. No shortage of them.
[10:48:52] <evilgohan2> I guess that's to be expected of a domain I've had since 2001.
[10:50:37] <ThePendulum> yeah it'll be a decade before it goes silent completely 
[10:50:49] <ThePendulum> hmm forwarding doesn't seem to work 
[10:50:50] <evilgohan2> well,  save for that year I lost it to a doamin snatcher and some godaddy bullshit...
[10:50:56] <evilgohan2> and had to use .net instead
[10:51:05] <evilgohan2> and then maintain BOTH for 2 years after the fact to clean things up
[10:51:15] <evilgohan2> that shit sucked.
[10:51:42] <evilgohan2> also, GoDaddy is hot garbage and should not be used by anyone for anything.
[10:53:03] <evilgohan2> ThePendulum: the way people sell lists of emails, it might not stop ever getting mail.
[10:53:28] <evilgohan2> I have a Yahoo account I haven't used since the mid-2000s that still gets emails. Mostly spam.
[10:53:54] <evilgohan2> I'm pretty sure the old AOL, NetZero, and Juno accounts are likely getting spammed too.
[10:54:11] <ThePendulum> true for the spambox, but silent in terms of mail I actually want will take ages too

[18:43:06] <ThePendulum> I don't know what to think about this article
[18:43:49] <ThePendulum> they are trying really hard to construe this as another case of police violence against innocent people in the US
[18:44:36] <ThePendulum> but what I gather from the article is that the girl was killed by a bullet that was shot at an assailant, bounced off the floor, went through a wall, and hit the girl
[18:45:28] <ThePendulum> whether the assailant needed to be shot is another story, but that's a /really/ unfortunate sequence of events and it doesn't seem quite fair to make it out like the officers shot the girl
[18:48:10] <Allie> ThePendulum: it is a danger of an unnecessary firearms discharge, though
[18:48:16] <unfinity> ・゜゜・。。・ ​ ゜゜\_ö​< QUA​CK!
[18:48:18] <Allie> ,bef
[18:48:18] <unfinity> Allie you befriended a duck in 2.138 seconds! You have made friends with 11 ducks in #datahoarder.
[18:49:01] <ThePendulum> I agree, but apparently CNN didn't think that was bad enough
[18:51:45] <joepie91> but they did shoot the girl, even if they weren't aiming at her
[18:51:56] <joepie91> no?
[18:54:48] <ThePendulum> sure, but imo it takes away from the actual problem if you wrap it in another problem, even if they are both bad
[18:54:57] <Hurricane> sounds more like a freak accident
[18:55:06] <Hurricane> like out of a Jackie Chan movie
[18:55:50] <joepie91> ThePendulum: it's the same problem though?
[18:56:38] <joepie91> like, the core problem here is "cops in the US use guns and other forms of violence like they're party poppers rather than as the last resort they are supposed to be"

[18:57:15] <joepie91> ricocheting bullets are as much a part of that problem as "trying to shoot somebody for no good reason" is
[19:00:46] *** Joins: alchemist (~alchemist@user/alchemist)
[19:02:15] <ThePendulum> I do think a cop deliberately shooting a 14 year old girl is a slightly different degree of that problem and it's not helpful to conflate that when reporting an incident
[19:02:22] <ThePendulum> people make a point of it when they do deliberately shoot a 14 year old black kid
[19:02:33] <ThePendulum> that way around it probably isn't the same thing
[19:02:45] <joepie91> I fail to see what "14 year old" has to do with anything
[19:03:03] <joepie91> and yes, when black kids are shot people point that out specifically because then it intersects with another problem, namely systemic racism
[19:03:09] <joepie91> that is not the problem I am talking about here
[19:03:48] <ThePendulum> because it implies the cop decided to shoot someone that was obviously innocent
[19:04:23] <ThePendulum> like them being unable to tell a random girl apart from the assailant is now officially part of the problem, which at least for this incident that's not how it happened
[19:08:13] <ThePendulum> just like a judge would distinguish between murder and death by negligence
[19:18:24] <ThePendulum> if you have a lot of road deaths, it could all considered a traffic safety problem, but road design, drunk drivers, and people deliberately crashing into other people require different solutions
[19:18:34] *** Joins: zer0bitz (~zer0bitz@196.244.192.57)
[19:19:21] <joepie91> I'm sorry, how is a "14 year old" "obviously innocent" but whoever was actually intended to be shot isn't?
[19:19:33] *** Joins: rawktucc (~rawktucc@user/rawktucc)
[19:20:01] <joepie91> ThePendulum: and actually no, we try to address *all* of those problems in road design in NL
[19:20:58] <joepie91> like, yes, I understand that there is a technical difference between "someone was killed by someone intending to shoot them" and "someone was killed because a bullet ricocheted", the thing is that I don't agree that it is a *meaningful* difference in this particular context
[19:21:16] <joepie91> and I feel like your reasons to argue it's a meaningful difference (like the age thing) are incredibly shaky and problematic
[19:21:51] <ThePendulum> the age is only relevant here because CNN is using it to gain support
[19:24:58] <ThePendulum> it just seems a bit sleazy, basically just "does the end justify the means?"
[19:27:40] <ThePendulum> like, you're saying it doesn't make a difference... but the way CNN reports it makes me think /they/ do think there's a difference, they know their readers do too
[19:29:27] <ThePendulum> regardless of whether it should or shouldn't, putting a young girl as the victim is always going to create more sensation and controversy
[19:30:17] <ThePendulum> if as you said it doesn't matter, they could've done an article about the actual assailant that was brutally shot for no good reason
[19:39:52] <evilgohan2> just to add a point of clarification
[19:40:24] <evilgohan2> the cops in that case shot at a person who wasn't even armed and happened to ALSO hit a 14 year old who was minding their business and trying to hide
[19:40:32] <evilgohan2> Which is a double fuck up
[19:41:08] <evilgohan2> Then the media carried the water with those half-assed articles featuring headines such as "14 year old hit by stray bullet"
[19:41:11] <evilgohan2> No
[19:41:22] <evilgohan2> 14 year old shot by cops wantonly engaging in unnecessary deadly force
[19:41:24] <evilgohan2> call it what it is
[19:41:31] <evilgohan2> But, oh no. We're not done yet.
[19:41:38] <evilgohan2> The true screw job ain't hit yet
[19:42:04] <evilgohan2> That will come when the "internal investigation" results in a finding of "no wrong doing or policy violations" on the part of the cops
[19:42:09] <ThePendulum> call it what you wish it was because you want to make a point, you mean?
[19:42:14] <evilgohan2> and, as usual, no one will be held accountable.
[19:42:22] <ThePendulum> because the first title is what it /was/
[19:42:46] <evilgohan2> No, call it what it is - lest you're removing agency from the cops and saying that the guns magically fired themselves
[19:43:10] <evilgohan2> Oh, and to top it all off, the tax payers of Los Angeles will foot the bill - as usual - for the inevitable civil suit.
[19:43:33] <evilgohan2> But the ones who actuallly shot her? Nah. No consequences. But a nice vacation with pay is upcoming though.
[19:45:21] <evilgohan2> See, in this universe, handguns don't typically fire themselves. If someone is hit by a bullet, it's because someone fired the gun that shot that bullet. You don't remove agency from the person who fired the gun. The gun didn't fire itself. A person did.
[19:46:10] <evilgohan2> That person is responsible for the shooting, and is in turn responsible for the death of that 14-year-old girl. To word it in any other way is to remove responsibility for the shooting from the individual who fired the weapon - regardless of the circumstances, or whether or not it was intentional.
[19:46:27] <ThePendulum> they should be judged for deciding the guy should be shot imo, the girl is still completely irrelevant imo
[19:46:31] <ThePendulum> she was behind a fucking wall
[19:47:55] <evilgohan2> Incidental contact is still contact.
[19:49:07] <evilgohan2> That's a failure to properly assess the situation, and that's compounded by the fact that they decided to open fire on an individual who was not armed. We call that disproportionate force.
[19:51:29] <evilgohan2> This isn't even a unique incident, unfortunately. When the cops decided to open fire on a stolen UPS truck that was in traffic, they did so knowing innocent persons were around (including one on the truck) who were also hit and killed. Once again: disproportionate force compounded by terrible decision making led to loss of life. You don't word that "UPS driver killed by stray bullet." 
[19:51:29] <evilgohan2> because, once again, you would be removing agency from the individuals who decided to open fire. You word that "UPS driver killed by police who were shooting at robbers."
[19:51:39] <evilgohan2> The latter is a factual statement, and assigns responsibility where it belongs.
[19:51:47] <evilgohan2> Once again, this is also _not_ a unique incident.
[19:52:44] <evilgohan2> Such as when the three off-duty UCs decided to raid the wrong house, shot a woman in her bed whilst shooting at someone else, and hit someone else in a completely different apartment. Inappropriate action led to disproprortionate use of force led to loss of life and injury suffered by multiple parties.
[19:53:04] <evilgohan2> and I'm frankly sick and tired of media carrying the water of police during these fucked up circumstances.
[19:53:49] <adeliktas> i don't engage in this discussion, but if you want to see the footage of this case for yourself here it is https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEqXDEOoyZM
[19:53:52] <evilgohan2> After all, it was in May 2020 when the police in Minneapolis let out a press release stating that a man "suffered a medical incident during a police stop" and the media fucking ran with it until a eight minute and 46 second cell phone video showed up.

[20:30:26] <ThePendulum> evilgohan2: the wording "UPS driver killed by police shooting at robbers" is exactly what I'd expect, not "UPS driver shot by police"
[20:41:35] <evilgohan2> I actually don't disagree. Unfortunately, we get headlines such this "A UPS driver was working a new route when he was taken hostage and killed in a chaotic police shootout"
[20:41:50] <evilgohan2> (Side note: that's a real headline -> https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2019/12/06/ups-driver-frank-ordonez-killed-florida-shootout/ )
[20:44:25] <evilgohan2> While technically, that statement is accurate, to someone just reading the headline, it gives the impression that he was killed by the robbers as the headline fails to properly assign responsibility. This is where my problem fundamentally exists with respect to how these headlines are written.
