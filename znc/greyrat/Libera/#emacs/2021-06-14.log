[04:31:55] <johnjay> there's an argument in the thread about who 'deserves' more rep on SO
[04:32:06] <johnjay> the person who asks 1 question of how to undo a commit in GIT and gets 200k votes
[04:32:21] <johnjay> a person who does many complex and technical answers for widely used software who gets 5k rep

[04:32:48] <grym> thinking that e-peen points have much at all to do with deserving is kind of missing the point 
[04:33:17] <johnjay> sure. but i think it does get to the point that someone can be answer crucial questions that let say gtk work better

[10:25:53] <dragestil> well, at least when I cd ~ in root
[10:26:30] <dragestil> C-x C-f uses $HOME of the pre-sudo user instead
[10:26:57] <bpalmer> it may be that a change in prompt confuses it (e.g., many users use # rather than $ in root's prompt)
[10:28:07] <dragestil> maybe, and I can't really open a file as root in the current emacs after sudo su
[10:28:15] <dragestil> ...using C-x C-f
[10:28:24] <bpalmer> dragestil: C-h f shell-directory-tracker ret mentions a whole bunch of variables that may be used to help track what the current directory is.
[10:29:01] <bpalmer> dragestil: I suggest doing stuff as root in a separate process entirely; but tramp does support editing files via su

[10:30:14] <dragestil> Oh, a separate emacs process

[12:29:15] <kilobug> dminuoso: just to be sure, you're not over a ssh session, nor inside screen/tmux ? and did you try with a different terminal emulator to know if it comes from Emacs or from the terminal itself ?

[15:54:52] <falko> Hi. I've switched to Emacs 27.1 few weeks ago and I do struggle with my own configuration. I have taken pretty basic (starter) configuration from someone's github, which looks like this: https://paste.mozilla.org/GcjsNeSG - now my question is how do I know that, for example, (menu-bar-mode -1) belongs do setq-default directive? Because I've tried to add more options to this group of settings and some of them 
[15:54:58] <falko> doesn't work in (setq-default ...)

[16:03:07] <falko> okay, so these settings are strictly for buffer, and setq-default applies them to *all* buffers, is that right?
[16:05:36] <bpalmer> setq-default changes the 'default' value for variables; this is the *initial* value a buffer-local variable has when a buffer is created.

[16:06:06] <bpalmer> but if something in that buffer changes the variable's value, it will ignore the default value.
[16:07:23] <bpalmer> falko: some things you don't change by changing a variable; instead, you control by calling a function.
[16:08:12] <bpalmer> If you do C-h v menu-bar-mode RET , you'll see setting the variable directly doesn't work. Instead, it suggests calling the function menu-bar-mode , or using customize.

[18:29:12] <bremner> you might be able to tell rsync to stop itself after a certain amount of transfer. Dunno, so many options
[18:29:25] <wasamasa> taeaad: no, because some of them have side effects such as deleting data
[18:29:51] <wasamasa> you want to do that after doing one continuous transfer
[18:29:54] <wasamasa> if at all
[18:30:06] <wasamasa> and ideally there'd be no change in files during that transfer

[22:53:54] <JordiGH> '   lol' -> '\t\t\tlol'
[22:54:23] <bpalmer> JordiGH: right, zero or more spaces. However, sadly, when q-r-r iterates, it doesn't reanchor.
[22:54:26] <lampilelo> in the example you replace a space with a tab
[22:54:27] <bpalmer> zero or more tabs.
[22:54:44] <bpalmer> zero more tabs, followed by a space. Replace that with the same initial header of tabs and a tab.
[22:54:53] <JordiGH> Er?
[22:55:05] <JordiGH> Replace all leading spaces with an equal number of tabs.
[22:55:19] <JordiGH> There are no tabs in the source.
[22:55:35] <lampilelo> if you hit ! it will do that
[22:55:51] <lampilelo> it will replace space by space
[22:55:57] <bpalmer> JordiGH: "  a" <-- two spaces and a character. That matches zero tabs, 1 space. replace that with a tab. "\t a" <-- now run it again. that matches 1 tab, 1 space; replace with 1 tab and a new tab.
[22:56:05] <JordiGH> I believe bpalmer's suggestion replaces all leading spaces with a single tab.
[22:56:19] <bpalmer> you would end up with "\t\ta".

[22:57:09] *** Joins: MidAutumnMoon (~MidAutumn@user/midautumnmoon)
[22:57:15] <bpalmer> So, the grand scheme of this would be : replace every sequence of 0 or more initial tabs (call that the leader) and 1 space with that same leader and a tab; then go back to the beginning; try again. Repeat until no more matches.
[22:57:50] <bpalmer> Or, alternatively, do a (while (re-search-forward ...) and just shove a (goto-char (point-at-bol)) after the replace-match and continue the loop.
[22:58:15] <JordiGH> Okay, and now for fun, what if the source had tabs followed by spaces but not at the beginning of the line?
[22:58:22] <bpalmer> that's why you anchor
[22:59:13] <bpalmer> (while (re-search-forward "^\\(\t*\\) " nil t) (replace-match "\\1\t") (goto-char (point-at-bol)))
[22:59:15] <bpalmer> tested and verified.
[22:59:51] <JordiGH> Okay, but that's not just a regex anymore.
[23:00:42] <JordiGH> So I still think it's technically impossible to write a regex that matches that and, uh, can count the number of spaces. Well, but search-and-replace isn't a regex either.
[23:00:48] <bpalmer> you could also fake it with the embedded lisp interpretation in regex replacements
[23:00:50] <JordiGH> Whatever.
[23:01:01] <JordiGH> I mean, yeah, I guess it can be one without too much difficulty.

[23:02:39] <bpalmer> but it's very straightforward to see a finite automaton that matches augmented with an output operator at each node to build a new string; this is no more powerful than a regular expression
[23:03:16] <bpalmer> you simply need a single state that represents you're in the leader position of a line, along with a state for having left it
[23:03:17] *** Joins: oxum (~oxum@106.201.113.95)
[23:03:33] <JordiGH> Yeah? DFA can do this?
[23:04:05] <bpalmer> in the one, you're matching every character and outputting the identity, but for spaces you're outputting tabs ; when you run into the first non-tab and non-space, switch states; you're now in the identity output function until you hit a newline, whereupon you output a newline and switch back to initial leader state.
[23:04:16] <bpalmer> Normal DFAs have no concept of output.
[23:04:42] *** Joins: martin_ (martin@185.71.208.255)
[23:04:49] <bpalmer> so you already have to introduce some augmentation, but this doesn't add any power to the language recognized.
