[16:13:18] <AndrewYu> Hey guys- I'm new here. I found the `darken' and `dark-mode' commands, but they won't change the color of the browser in general (it's nice that the pages are darkened). I would also like to customize the color scheme (be it in Lisp or CSS) manually, for example setting the background #000000. How would I do that? More generally, how would I customize the browser? Thanks
[16:14:26] <AndrewYu> Note: I am aware of init.lisp, just that I'm not sure what specific settings to put in it. Is there any way to dump all current settings? Due to the way how Lisp works, that might not be possbile, just asking, thanks :D
[16:15:49] <aartaka> AndrewYu: curently, theme is hardcoded, so you cannot dump it. However, you can customize the theme for your liking. There are two ways:
[16:16:35] <aartaka> 1. Find someone's themed config. Shameless plug: mine is https://github.com/aartaka/nyxt-config
[16:18:06] <AndrewYu> Thanks- That gave me (1) a good theme (2) thoughts on how to configure the browser :D
[16:18:15] <aartaka> 2. Wait for the color theme configuration pull request (#1889) to be merged (going to happen pretty soon, I bet this week) and build Nyxt from master to enjoy easier configuration.
[16:18:35] <aartaka> AndrewYu: You're welcome :)
[16:18:42] <AndrewYu> Oof, i guess I'm gonna update then :D
[16:19:31] <AndrewYu> the settings look like CSS written in Lisp
[16:20:16] <aartaka> AndrewYu: in case you'd find my config missing something, you can always search for `style` slots and their values using `describe-slot` command.
[16:20:32] <AndrewYu> Oo, thanks!
[16:20:36] <aartaka> AndrewYu: Indeed a Lisp compiling to CSS it is :D
[16:21:04] <aartaka> We do prefer Lisp over any other language :)
[16:21:07] * AndrewYu proceeds to make his browser look like the Airbus A350 EFIS, at least with the colors and borders
[16:21:38] <AndrewYu> Yeah. I was introduced to lisp 2 months ago by Emacs (though I don't like emacs that much), and now I'm reimplementing all of my programs
[16:31:57] <Kabouik> AndrewYu for an other example of a dark theme, you can look at my dotfiles at https://git.teknik.io/matf/nyxt

[16:34:24] <AndrewYu> Thx
[16:34:55] <AndrewYu> I'm more of a high-contrast-dark guy though, xD
[16:35:13] <Kabouik> yeah but you can change the colours, it's just to give you a hint of which variables were modified
[16:36:10] <AndrewYu> Yup :D
[16:36:18] <Kabouik> Also don't pay attention to the low dpi of the screenshot, it's taken from a phone
[16:37:01] <AndrewYu> Ah. And one more (newbie) question:  Does nyxt use Xlib, qt, gtk, tk or something else?
[16:37:03] <Kabouik> I should just have taken the screenshots from my computer, I always feel I have to explainthe low dpi on those I put in the readme :p
[16:37:21] <AndrewYu> I want to have an idea of making graphical lisp programs, since I am for utilizing our bitmap displays
[16:37:31] <Kabouik> I think qt or gtk, with a choice when you compile it. Is that correct, someone?
[16:37:55] <AndrewYu> :\ I don't like those toolkits
[16:38:01] <AndrewYu> Mostly too bloated
[16:38:25] <AndrewYu> I see many mentions of gtk in the source
[16:38:47] <AndrewYu> No mentions of qt by find(1)
[16:39:42] <Kabouik> https://github.com/atlas-engineer/nyxt/blob/master/documents/README.org#qt-dependencies
[16:40:16] <Kabouik> (I never tried)
[16:41:19] <AndrewYu> Finding nyxt was... really exciting for me... having to use Gtk or qt is a small disappointment
[16:41:29] <AndrewYu> but still a nice browser
[16:42:20] <Kabouik> I do have big responsiveness issues with the UI but I seem to be the only one to have such big issues, others agree that there's room for improvement but it's not as bad as on my devices
[16:43:13] <Kabouik> Weirdly Nyxt is more responsive on my phones and my fanless SBC Linux computers than on my more powerful Linux laptop, so surely there must be something on the configuration of that one involved.
[16:43:27] <Kabouik> Anyhow, a more frugal UI would be great
[16:44:38] <Kabouik> There was also some lisp UI thingamajig brought up in the discussions here once, but I don't think Nyxt can work with it yet
[16:44:56] <AndrewYu> Would love to see that
[16:45:38] <Kabouik> I wonder if it was CLIM
[16:45:49] <Kabouik> Someone from the dev team can surely comment on that later when they see this
[17:09:41] *** Joins: aartaka (aartaka@gateway/vpn/protonvpn/aartaka)
[17:48:46] <edgarvincent[m]> AFAIK, the current builds of Nyxt use WebkitGTK, but the UI is HTML and CSS. So GTK is used in the viewport and the rest of the interface is HTML/CSS.
[17:49:23] <edgarvincent[m]> CLIM has been talked about, but it is no used in Nyxt, AFAIK.
[17:50:46] <edgarvincent[m]> So I don't think you need to use GTK (Nyxt accesses the renderer through agnostic ffi's) if you want to make an app with Nyxt.
[17:51:12] <edgarvincent[m]> (Not a dev, though, I may be making this up)
[17:55:34] <edgarvincent[m]> For discussion about the UI lib, see https://github.com/atlas-engineer/nyxt/issues/1190 and https://github.com/atlas-engineer/nyxt/tree/master/libraries/user-interface
