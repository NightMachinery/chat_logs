[15:39:12] <monr0e> hotmess is right, though
[15:39:51] <monr0e> Even better, your DB should be on a separate machine to your webhost, and accept only connections from that same webhost.

[15:44:07] <Kiernian|Work> and I don't say that as some fuddy-duddy sysadmin wanting to hold on to physical servers and old architecture for everything

[15:44:24] <Kiernian|Work> how's that nosql business working out for New World over at Amazon? LOL
[15:44:48] <monr0e> koollman: I'm probably of that opinion because of the industry crossover. I'm technically a sysadmin these days too, and I was a linux admin back int he day. I'm nowhere near competent, but this is like, basic stuff
[15:44:50] <sd_> 11<H​otmess> new world has issues entrily not related to nosql 😉
[15:45:08] <sd_> 11<H​otmess> but yeah take a look at the distrabuted ACID databses like cockroachDB
[15:48:02] <monr0e> koollman: If the webserver is compromised, the intruder will most likely simply copy what code there is on the machine. It will be at least a short while before they realise that what they have is limited to IP, rather than PII. That gives you time to discover, and react to, the intrusion. Furthermore, since that password is now solely in memory, it takes a rather unique skillset to read it. T
[15:49:22] <monr0e> That is opposed to the DB being on the *same* machine, and likely vulnerable to x number of CVEs that we don't know about yet. Plus, even if they *do* realise that there are no passwords in the source code, they still have to maintain an active connection to the web server to access the DB in the first place. That increases their visibility.
[15:49:27] <koollman> monr0e: why would the code be solely in memory ?
[15:49:37] <koollman> err, the password, I mean
[15:54:12] <sd_> 12<c​ooleb09> nice
[15:54:20] <sd_> 12<c​ooleb09> thinking of geeting some as PAWs
[15:54:47] <monr0e> The *password* solely in memory. Because it has never been hardcoded. The only time a web application should see a DB password is in the setup instance. Sure, there are devs who will store this in a localindex (which *does* get written to disk, btw), but the best approach (imo) is to keep it in the runtime of the host service. That's where, at least in IIS, StartMode comes in handy. You can technically also use a Singleton service to 
[15:54:47] <monr0e> accomplish the same, although you might run into session persistence bugs in that regard.

[20:05:14] <sd_> 13<C​olour> So many things in Azure or AWS can be on prem and they spend thousands on it when we have space for more on prem servers
[20:05:27] <sd_> 13<C​olour> I think half the reason is to just avoid IT and the other half is "Look we're in the cloud!"
[20:06:07] <sd_> 14<K​illnine> If your dev teams don't have a cloud-first mindset it can get very expensive to have stuff there
[20:06:07] <fritzwastaken> Yea, we have a lot of rogue teams/departments whos managers have Corp credit cards or flat out have their own AWS environment
[20:06:11] <fritzwastaken> but dont even fall under IT
[20:06:14] <koollman> it's part of the reason. the other part is that IT can also be something you have to spend thousands on, with worse results sometimes :)

[20:07:47] <koollman> I've seen companies where getting a vm to run stuff for a project may take 2 to 3 months. But an aws vm cost is reimbursed at the end of the month. So ... it kind of makes people not want to go on-prem :)

[20:12:01] <sd_> 13<C​olour> I don't know a thing about SQL but I bet there's some kind of migration tool and I can probably just sort it out somehow
[20:12:23] <sd_> 13<C​olour> All I know is open RDP server on Azure with SQL on it that they connect using SQL Management Studio is probably wrong
[20:12:23] <sd_> 14<K​illnine> Yes, there's a migration path that's pretty straightforward depending on the availability you need
[20:12:35] <sd_> 08<b​denlinger> Killnine the PHP app is trash and we need to rebuild from scratch. Unfortunately that's a 6 to 12 month project and it's a money maker so no downtime is allowed.

[23:04:45] <Hunterkll> if you adjust for inflation, even with the speculators causing the prices to skyrocket in the futures markets (thus  price increases to pay for hte next batch of fuel being delivered next month), we're still doing pretty damn good price wise compared to historically 
[23:04:47] <DomLS3> the issue is the charging stations not being on every corner like a gas station
