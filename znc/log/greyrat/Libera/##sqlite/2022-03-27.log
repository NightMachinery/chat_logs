[05:46:25] <Chunky_Ks> arkanoid: because the way to read an SHM database is to open the database then the journal
[05:46:44] <Chunky_Ks> and if you don't open the journal, it doesn't make sense. what if a writer comes along after you've already opened it?
[05:46:58] <Chunky_Ks> just makes more sense to have all the pieces at your disposal out the gate
[05:48:53] <arkanoid> Chunky_Ks: makes sense. But now I have a question. How to find out if the sqlite database is complete? Let me give an example. Let's say the sqlite + wal + shm files are in a shared folder on a dropbox like service. The writer is on one side, the reader on the other side. How can the reader assest that the database is valid to be read and in sync with the writer?
[05:51:21] <arkanoid> I'm stress-testing this point with 'while :; sqlite3 "file:data.sqlite?mode=ro" "PRAGMA integrity_check"; end' on the reader side, but not matter how ofter i commit transactions on the writer side and how "best effort" the sync service is moving data from the writer side to the reader side, I keep getting "ok"
[05:52:55] <arkanoid> I mean, the .sqlite file and the -wal file are moving at different speeds from the point of view of the reader, as the sync algorithm doesn't move the container folder atomically, but just file by file
[05:53:13] <arkanoid> I was expecting some corruption or read errors somewhere, but actually I'm not

[07:28:11] <Chunky_Ks> sqlite is pretty heroic about avoiding corruption
[07:28:14] <Chunky_Ks> being said, you can't.
[07:28:36] <Chunky_Ks> network file shares, of almost any variant you'll cross in reality, are not up to the task of making the gaurantees that you desire
[07:31:14] <Chunky_Ks> the best you could get, even in spirit, still doesn't align with your statement that well: "complete" is only meaningful in the sense of "the last transaction was fully committed". Whatever database you're using, sqlite or otherwise
[07:31:55] <Chunky_Ks> all of which goes quadruple with something like dropbox, which isn't even a network share, so much as an occasional rsync
