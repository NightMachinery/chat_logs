[00:43:58] <AnonymooseReddtr> sorry i'm just coming back to chat lol 
[00:43:59] <signofzeta> Microsoft SQL Server
[00:44:05] <sd> 08<bâ€‹denlinger> signofzeta shrinking sucks for performance because growing a file is extremely performance consuming
[00:44:13] <AnonymooseReddtr> yea you can build a maintenance plan 
[00:44:16] <Activ8> MS SQL yes I said MYSQL by mistake
[00:44:16] <AnonymooseReddtr> to rebuild index
[00:44:18] <signofzeta> And shrinking a database can cause fragmentation.
[00:44:33] <AnonymooseReddtr> as far as shrinking a log file - make sure your database recovery model is set appropriately (FULL or SIMPLE) 
[00:44:42] <Activ8> scary shit
[00:44:43] <AnonymooseReddtr> If FULL make sure you are taking regular transaction log backups 
[00:44:43] <signofzeta> But re-indexing eliminates fragmentation, though it grows the file.  In this one specific case, it won't grow the file to its current size.  (Massive database purge)
[00:44:56] <AnonymooseReddtr> and the transaction log will eventually cull itself 
[00:45:04] <AnonymooseReddtr> you should never need to manually shrink a transaction log 
[00:45:07] <signofzeta> The logs are fine, I'm talking about the data.

[02:53:37] <mistiry> but maybe thats cuz i dont actively seek out ways to wage theft
[02:54:08] <Activ8> I had one manager who wanted everything logged so we starting putting daft things on the ticket system lol
[02:54:29] <fritzwastaken> The manager at the job I just left wanted you to have the ticket window open so the timer would be clicking as you worked on things

[02:54:51] <fritzwastaken> If you were working on something he would say "What ticket are you working on? I see its only been open for 2 minutes, havent you been working on this for a half hour?"

[02:59:47] <mistiry> taking mental breaks or stepping away for a bit of time is fine, and necessary. but if you're so bored and cannot come up with a single thing you can do, most likely you're not looking hard enough. even if the thing to do is demo a new tool, or take a course to refresh skills, or write docs, or make diagrams.

[03:00:24] <Activ8> Order kit you donâ€™t need just to learn if thereâ€™s a budget
[03:01:19] <mistiry> Patching process sucks? Start looking at how to improve. Monitor system sends inactionable alerts? Start looking at ways to limit it to just actionable things. Regularly get asked to provide network diagrams? Maybe give those a refresh.
[03:01:28] <mistiry> So many things that are never really "done". 
[03:01:48] <Activ8> You need a budget usually to progress anything 
[03:01:55] <mistiry> Not necessarily true
[03:02:06] <mistiry> You dont need a budget to draw diagrams or write docs
[03:02:40] <mistiry> You dont need a budget to clean up old file servers, or to write some new scripts that automate something
[03:03:13] <mistiry> Lots of things you can do that dont have an upfront cost associated with it
[03:03:53] <Activ8> What you going to write on? stationary costs. Printing, costs,  Some apps cost but mainly can be found in open source.  However need hardware to run them on usually.
[03:04:24] <mistiry> Ok, so first, not *actually* writing with like, a pen...
[03:04:40] <Activ8> pens cost if you donâ€™t have any 
[03:05:00] <Cl0udNinja> Activ8, you are now officially going to be known as 'the reason sysadmins get a bad rap'
[03:05:04] <mistiry> And it depends. Have a system already in place? Start there. Nothing at all, lots of things you can start with. Set up a free Wiki. Use Word docs. Notepad. Other free tools.
[03:05:09] <Cl0udNinja> you're a shit sysadmin if you think like this
[03:05:38] <Activ8> lol trust me Iâ€™m the one saving company money I never spend it always finding ways to not need a budget thatâ€™s my problem

[03:06:28] <jxel> hi :)
[03:06:31] <mistiry> Management that argues that point is out of touch.
[03:06:53] <Activ8> Iâ€™m used to having no budget 
[03:07:09] <jxel> mistry - did you previously work for RH?
[03:07:12] <Activ8> every company Iâ€™ve worked for I e made a difference by not spending money where itâ€™s not needed
[03:07:19] <mistiry> jxel: not me
[03:07:31] <jxel> ah ok ty for clarifying
[03:07:42] <mistiry> Yes, you shouldnt spend money where it's not needed. But you *should* spend money where it *is* needed.
[03:07:50] <mistiry> That second part gets forgotten all too often.
[03:07:59] <mistiry> jxel: yeah no problem
[03:07:59] <Activ8> common sense approach 
[03:08:09] <Activ8> version 1.0
[03:08:34] <mistiry> You absolutely can make a difference by finding ways to cut costs. In fact, you should be actively seeking ways to do that.
[03:08:56] <Activ8> and thatâ€™s why Iâ€™ve left companies.  No budget to improve aspects that need a budget
[03:09:07] <mistiry> But you should also be advocating for proper tooling, even if that tooling costs money.
[03:09:22] <mistiry> Instead of just saying "I dont want to use X because its not free"
[03:09:31] <Activ8> ofc
[03:09:51] <mistiry> Let management say that, if they want. But as a sysadmin, part of the job is advocating for the right toolsets, and convincing management why it is needed.
[03:10:26] <Activ8> trust me Iâ€™ve been there you end up get sick of management lol
[03:10:29] <corn266> i'd say you usually frame it as a cost effective way to reduce personnel costs
[03:10:55] <mistiry> Even if historically "there isnt any money", you should still make the push if you truly need whatever it is you are asking for.

[03:11:08] <Activ8> Yes 
[03:11:15] <Activ8> I know ðŸ˜Š
[03:11:27] <mistiry> Well it's not always reducing personnel costs, but I get your point. "We can get more work done with less people if we buy X"
[03:11:50] <mistiry> But there are other factors. End-user experience, or customer experience. 
[03:11:57] <mistiry> Those two can be big.
[03:12:18] <Activ8> Good way to get people redundant 
[03:12:37] <mistiry> "Getting X tool will allow for X, Y, Z, thus drastically improving response times to A and getting our customers operational B% quicker"
[03:12:40] <mistiry> or something
[03:12:52] <gibby> BUSINESS CASE!
[03:12:59] <Activ8> Yep
[03:13:05] <gibby> something a lot of IT folks struggle with
[03:13:06] <mistiry> gibby: its almost like ive been in management before :/
[03:13:09] <corn266> You say redundant but if I get hit by a bus it'll take months for someone to pick even figure out what's going on in our infra
[03:13:17] <gibby> mistiry: I don't believe you :P
[03:13:22] <mistiry> Why dont you have it better documented?
[03:13:28] <gibby>  /s
[03:13:28] <corn266> job security
[03:13:34] <mistiry> Shouldn't take months for someone to get up to speed on what anyone does.
[03:13:34] <Activ8> yeh document that shit
[03:13:42] <mistiry> That isn't job security.
[03:13:56] <mistiry> That's "guaranteed to ruin vacations and make me the chokepoint"
[03:14:03] <Activ8> Shouldnâ€™t, Couldnâ€™t, Wouldnâ€™t
[03:14:17] <Activ8> shouda, coulda, woulda
[03:14:31] <corn266> because, until very recently, there was no one else at the company that could do the job
[03:14:47] <Activ8> ive seen dev ops trying that trick lol
[03:15:04] <Activ8> the whole department was made redundant for new external
[03:15:09] <mistiry> That doesn't mean you can't have things documented such that, if they did hire someone else, they'd be helpful to you sooner than "months"
[03:15:17] <Activ8> sneeky management changed job titles 
[03:15:23] <mistiry> Documenting helps yourself as much as your team
[03:15:46] <mistiry> Once you have it documented, you dont answer questions about it anymore. Someone asks, and you point to the doc.
[03:15:49] <corn266> which is why i _have_ documentation and the sysadmin we hired has already started doing a multitude of projects that i couldn't get to
[03:16:09] <Activ8> Iâ€™m big on documentation and service desks always push for it if a company doesnâ€™t have it,  Iâ€™ve implemented that across 4 companies so far and itâ€™s worked and continued

[03:17:21] <gibby> well, there are two parallel paths on that mistiry-- there is the lack of documentation path (or the reverse) that can help with someone getting a grasp on what has, is, and will exist and how it operates, there the second piece being how that individual can interact with the same set of information. I certainly wouldn't drop a secanalyst into a risk assessment in their first few months without them knowing and understanding why we do

[03:36:48] <mistiry> gibby: it was more in regards to what i'd call standard sysadmin work. Yes, they need time to learn "the ways", but they also shouldn't have to struggle for weeks/months on stuff like "What networks do we have" or "What switches are used" - that kind of thing. The company-specific stuff sure, and for jobs more complex that basic sysadmin, I'd expert a longer ramp-up.

[13:04:28] <Activ8> the thing is with those video door bells do you have to put up a notice saying recording on motion in action
[13:04:48] <Activ8> in the uk when you have a camera you need to put a sign up saying that there is recordings going on in this area

[13:06:24] <Activ8> In May 2018, General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) came into effect. So anyone with a CCTV system â€“ even if it's just one camera â€“ is now required to comply and use their systems within the new guidelines. A major element of the new rules include the use of CCTV signs in public space.

[21:39:47] <jr> https://libera.chat/guides/channelmodes
[21:42:32] <jr> for those who have cloud-based phone systems, if someone calls from outside, is it relatively normal if there's a delay between the time it starts ringing on the caller's end and when it starts showing as an incoming call on screen with a receptionist?

[21:54:47] <jr> ah ok, so UK
[21:54:55] <jr> can't be too much different from other US providers though
[21:55:06] <Activ8> to be honest it depends on the routing
[21:55:06] <jr> i'm just curious if it's a normal thing with most cloud carriers
[21:55:20] <Activ8> I would say no 8 seconds isn't normal but there might be a delay depends on routing
[21:55:49] <jr> yeah we're trying to figure out how to reduce it as much as possible....not sure there is much else we can do at this point

[21:58:36] <Activ8> we possibly may be migrating to them in the future, we been doing a small project to see if it's worth while
[21:58:41] <jr> overall its been fine except for this

[22:00:14] <jr> no, it's ringing
[22:00:27] <jr> i think it's less of an issue than they're making it out to be
[22:00:29] <Activ8> have you tested it yourself
[22:00:33] <jr> but i don't have all the money i suppose
[22:00:41] <Activ8> have you done the diagnostics? rebooted end phone e.t.c
[22:00:44] <Activ8> did routing checks?
[22:00:59] <jr> yeah, i've had one of my help desk guys do testing....it's pretty consistently 8 seconds before it starts ringing on our end
[22:01:22] <jr> and we're all using headsets, so no desk phones
[22:01:30] <Activ8> saying that when you could out loud 8 seconds that is a pretty big delay for no ring at the other end
[22:01:39] <Activ8> so it's soft voip ?
[22:01:45] <jr> not really sure how to check routing other than determining what the number is routed to, which is currently a call queue
[22:01:58] <jr> yep
[22:02:04] <Activ8> I'm not sure on teams how it would be done haven't used the phone system as of yet
[22:02:24] <jr> yeah there aren't a lot of great diagnostic tools built in
[22:02:42] <Activ8> how about if you call from teams desktop to teams desktop is this only happening on external device > internal device?
[22:02:49] *** Joins: Alternity (~Alternity@user/alternity)
[22:03:17] <Activ8> maybe open a support ticket with Microsoft they might be able to run some checks or have connection diagnostics logs
[22:03:34] <jr> it seems like it's only for call queues/auto attendants
[22:03:42] <jr> if you call a user's direct number, it rings immediately
[22:03:51] <jr> so it must be something in their system
[22:04:17] <jr> we've been in contact with microsoft about it with no luck....had another firm we're familiar with that is using Teams Phone test it, and they see the same delay
[22:04:34] <jr> at this point, i've been just checking alternatives just in case i get told "we need to change phone systems"
[22:04:39] <Activ8> so if they see the same delay it has to be the system then
[22:04:47] <jr> yeah it seems that way
[22:04:48] <Activ8> if it's been tested by another teams user
[22:05:01] <AnonymooseReddtr> jr what exactly are you seeing? 
[22:05:05] <AnonymooseReddtr> I missed the original message
[22:05:22] <Activ8> I would be surprised if the ceo says to change another system over a 8 second delay, has to be investigated fully first
[22:05:58] <jr> AnonymooseReddtr: we're using Teams Phone, and when calling a number that is routed to a call queue/auto attendant, it takes about 8 seconds of ringing on the callers end before it actually starts ringing to the queue/AA
[22:06:12] <sd> 06<oâ€‹nenerdyguy> yeah, that wouldn't fly here
[22:06:45] <AnonymooseReddtr> Are you using Direct Routing or Calling plans? 
[22:06:48] <jr> i honestly just think it's an issue with whatever microsoft is doing on the back end since calls to direct numbers for users ring almost immediately
[22:06:53] <jr> calling plans
[22:07:04] <jr> we tested direct routing and saw pretty much the same delay
[22:07:07] <AnonymooseReddtr> k 
[22:07:14] <AnonymooseReddtr> lemme ask some peeps
[22:07:41] <jr> at this point i'm wondering if it's a common thing with all cloud-based phone providers, or if there are providers where this isn't happening
[22:08:37] <AnonymooseReddtr> I'm in a training session ATM so it might be a bit, but i'll ask around
[22:08:41] <jr> we're coming from an on-prem shoretel system using SIP trunking which rang immediately, so it has been a bit of an adjustment
[22:08:59] <jr> no problem, obviously looking for any insight i can get
[22:09:03] <AnonymooseReddtr> peoeple on my team do a LOT of teams phone system work 
[22:09:23] <jr> cool...maybe they've seen this then

[22:11:46] <jr> we previously had an AA out in front of the call queue....during business hours it would transfer immediately to the call queue but outside of business hours, callers would get the automated message for after hours
[22:12:07] <jr> however, we found this added about 3 seconds to make a total of 11 seconds before it started ringing on our end, so we routed straight to the call queue
[22:12:19] <jr> cut off a few seconds, but still not great
[22:13:27] <AnonymooseReddtr> do you have confernece mode turned on for the queue?
[22:14:09] <AnonymooseReddtr> or is it 8 seconds of ringing < call queue> then user? 
[22:15:00] <jr> yes, conference mode is turned on
[22:15:19] <jr> set to "Attendant routing" so it should ring all the logged in users at the same time
[22:16:12] <AnonymooseReddtr> dumb q do you have people logged into the queue?
[22:16:27] <jr> yep, generally we have at least two logged in at all times
[22:16:31] <AnonymooseReddtr> ok
[22:16:33] <jr> sometimes three or four
[22:16:41] <AnonymooseReddtr> if nobody is logged into the queue then it will just ring forever :D
[22:17:00] <jr> ha yeah....we do have a timeout set where it routes to an AA after 45 seconds if no one answers
