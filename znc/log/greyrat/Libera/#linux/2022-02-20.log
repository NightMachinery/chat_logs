[00:22:02] <ninjabanjo> I'm trying to install debian 11 to a raid 1 of two usb sticks. I've create the mdadm raid for the /boot but it keeps failing to install grub bootloader. i have no clue what i've missed
[00:22:19] <ninjabanjo> can i find logs or something somewhere?
[00:22:21] <ayecee> what happens when you try
[00:22:32] <ninjabanjo> the installer says it failed, thats it
[00:22:55] <ball> You don't want grub on the array though, you'd want it on the boot sector of each stick, I would think.
[00:22:55] <hexnewbie> ninjabanjo: EFI System Partition if you're on UEFI, or biosgrub partition if you're on GPT + BIOS
[00:23:28] <ninjabanjo> the installer complains when i try to make two /boot tho
[00:23:29] <ball> (or if it's too big, in something that the first stage bootloader can see)
[00:23:47] <ball> ninjabanjo: You may have to do it manually.
[00:23:55] <ayecee> ninjabanjo: maybe you can see the logs by pressing alt-f3 or something.
[00:24:05] <hexnewbie> /boot on RAID is fine

[00:25:14] <hexnewbie> ball: Part of grub lives in /boot, another part lives in the EFI System Partition (or MBR and extra-partition space on BIOS)
[00:25:20] <ninjabanjo> so what, use dd to clone the partition to the second stick post install?

[00:29:25] <jim> grub has modules for things like lvm or specific disk controller chipsets, and they should come in with stage2 of grub... another thing that comes in, is the ability to locate files by name (which means grub has modules also for the various filesystem types)
[00:29:26] <ninjabanjo> I had manually made a md array with metadata version 1.0 and then tried to install `/boot` onto that with the installer. but grub install failed and doesn't say why. i also expect it to work?

[00:30:34] <ayecee> ninjabanjo: guess you could try manually installing grub too.
[00:30:46] <hexnewbie> ninjabanjo: GRUB 2 installs fine on any MD RAID with any metadata version, so 0.8 and 1.0 are not needed, and not helpful.
[00:31:05] <hexnewbie> ninjabanjo: The MD RAID for /boot is not the problem

[14:03:17] <cockatoodude> things. So even a process run as root can't mess with protected processes, and processes can be whitelisted for interaction with or by root processes. and improvements to kexec hardboot, as well as some tweaks to CPU governing modes, and a new task scheduler intended for use with mobile devices that have process priorities easy to define and change, as well as lower power consumption cased by wake-locks, and
[14:03:18] <cockatoodude> more optimized compression for gzip and bzip2 as well as decompression for only bzip. And I am not sure this will be accepted, but a patch that goes along with a gcc patch, to allow debuggers to trace code execution from an ide someone else can make I don't do much end user userspace work, but line-by-line execution, similar to lcc-w32 debugger that isn't supported anymore.

[18:03:33] <hexnewbie> ninjabanjo: Like, you don't have to do anything special to make even my insane setup boot, let alone your simple one. Your actions are usually not required. Grub gets installed, initramfs gets generated, everything works
[18:03:42] <Lebela> I have a "mother script" and a "child script",  and I would like the "mother script" to be terminated upon the "child script" hitting an "else"

[18:04:08] <ninjabanjo> hexnewbie, that's my typical experience as well. but seems something is causing things to go amuck. i had to install grub manualy to get this far
[18:04:35] <ninjabanjo> im _not_ using uefi. would that be of issue?
[18:04:38] <ayecee> ninjabanjo: that was already a pretty good sign that something was off the rails.
[18:04:42] <ninjabanjo> (system supports legacy boot)

[18:04:55] <ayecee> ninjabanjo: did you boot the installer via legacy boot?
[18:05:01] <CuriosTiger> A child process cannot generally influence its parent process directly. You could have the parent process pass its process ID to the child process, though, and have the child process kill it with a kill -TERM $PID
[18:05:02] <hexnewbie> ninjabanjo: I suspect, depending on *how* you installed grub, its manual installation may be the cause of the new issue

[18:08:52] <CuriosTiger> Lebela: When the child script terminates, it can send a return value to the parent script. You modify the parent script to understand that that return code means it should terminate, and then you add the code to act on that in the parent script.
[18:08:53] <ninjabanjo> maybe i should try uefi and give up on legacy?

[18:09:13] <hexnewbie> ninjabanjo: Given the likelihood of a UEFI install (grub-pc not being installed suggests your installer thinks you booted in UEFI mode), you not creating the EFI system partitions seems to be the cause

[18:10:59] <hexnewbie> However, the fact that ‘grub-install /dev/sda’ didn't fail somehow conflicts with that (as an installer in UEFI mode would make GPT partition table, and that would need *another* special partition)

[18:14:32] <ayecee> ninjabanjo: it's already the default. you don't have to force it.
[18:14:39] <hexnewbie> ninjabanjo: Also, in the commands you did, you didn't regenerate grub.cfg with ‘update-grub’, and you didn't (re)generate the initramfs ‘update-initramfs’ and some combination of options. It theoretically shouldn't be a problem, as the installer should have ran those before failing to install grub, but who knows

[18:15:34] <ninjabanjo> hexnewbie, i left those out to avoid typing a wall. i did at some point run those as well. maybe just not all at once. grub.cfg didn't exist post install

[20:36:52] <hexnewbie> If you don't have an initrd, or your initrd doesn't perform a btrfs device scan, you can still mount a multi-volume btrfs filesystem by passing all the devices in the filesystem explicitly to the mount command.

[20:40:25] <ninjabanjo> well, fak. that's kind of useless if it won't even boot
[20:40:45] <ayecee> even mdadm requires a special boot parameter to boot in degraded mode

[20:41:18] <hexnewbie> ninjabanjo: When a device fails, you set the degraded option, replace the device, then fix the PARTUUIDs in fstab and rebuiild initramfs (last two actions wouldn't be needed if not for this workaround)

[20:43:47] <hexnewbie> I have a LVM volume group of *four* disks using *four* LUKS volumes, the Btrfs root lives on two LVs on two of the PVs of the volume group, and the initramfs only unlocks the two PVs in question, one by one, causing LVM to go insane on its two missing disks, but the btrfs thing gets no issues

[21:55:01] <FuriousGeorge> for some reason, I still have trouble figuring out what is using my ram and why.  i have a server with 512 gb of ram, 504 of which are available to the OS
[21:55:15] <FuriousGeorge> i see close to 30gb used in htop
[21:55:42] *** Quits: yuljk (~yuljk@86.11.178.103) (Ping timeout: 272 seconds)
[21:55:47] <FuriousGeorge> however:  ps aux | sort -nk +4 | tail -n 10 shows that no single process is using a gigabyte
[21:56:27] <FuriousGeorge> the usage bar in htop is mostlt green, indicating it isn't cached memory....   im looking at free output, and nothing jumps out at me
[21:56:40] *** Quits: l4s8g__ (~l4s8g@pd9e6249c.dip0.t-ipconnect.de) (Quit: l4s8g__)
[21:56:53] <FuriousGeorge> so is the kernel just using gigabytes of ram and hiding it from the rest of the OS?
[21:57:36] <FuriousGeorge> if i try to run my ./memory_intenive_process, I am right onthe border of running out of ram, and theres nothing I can do except keep adding swap
[21:57:56] <FuriousGeorge> which I've been doing, but eventually I keep exhausting my ram
[21:58:10] <FuriousGeorge> if I restart the server, then I see a more reasonable 5 or 6 gb in use

[22:56:05] <mitacho> I was looking at this issue on GitLab ( https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/pulseaudio/pulseaudio/-/issues/998  ) and trying to add the following line to /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base.conf but it didn't work either: options snd-usb-audio index=-2 quirk_alias=0c76120c:095116ea
[22:56:46] <cockatoodude> I actually found learning arabic easier than transliteration based understanding of the machine translation... for interpretation of deeper meanings and implications of translated language content though, transliteration is the best

[23:51:49] <katp32> ....and I think I figured it out in any case; the util-linux mount exits successfully with no message when using --all if /proc isn't already mounted, so you have to mount /proc first before you mount the rest

[23:52:18] <katp32> not really?
[23:52:19] <ayecee> Tangent-Man: so there's no leftover vpn interfaces, your routing table is fine, and you can ping your gateway. at this point it seems like the gateway may be the problem.
[23:52:34] <matsaman> katp32: why isn't proc mounted?
[23:52:52] <katp32> because this is during boot process when I'm trying to mount /proc, /dev, etc
[23:53:04] <Tangent-Man> The router? I tried restarting it... Hmm..
[23:53:22] <matsaman> katp32: why would you run mount -a during boot instead of using fstab?
[23:53:28] <katp32> uhm
[23:53:32] <katp32> mount -a *is* using fstab
[23:53:42] <matsaman> instead of just using fstab

[23:57:29] <katp32> all /etc/fstab does is change the behaviour of the mount command, the kernel doesn't read /etc/fstab or anything like that. maybe there are other programs that read it like systemd or something, but that isn't the case here
[23:58:14] <katp32> `mount -a` tries to mount everything in /etc/fstab that doesn't have noauto, that's the typical way of mounting everything when the system boots
[23:58:26] <katp32> not sure what the confusion is
