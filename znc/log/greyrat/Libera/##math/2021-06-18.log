This is "good enough" if you don't want absolutely accurate positioning or want to stretch propulsion as far as possible. If you DO, then general relativity, space and planetary weather, tracking all the planets and moons, etc gets involved and it's VERY complex with lots of tricks to make it tractable to even a powerful computer

[01:32:01] <riv> an ideal is "like zero" in that multiplying anything in the ideal with anything from the ring ends up back in the ideal

[03:59:58] <Cale> This thing is *so* much easier to get to the point of being musical than an ordinary piano even. I actually think the advantage might be more than the obvious factor of 12 improvement.
[04:00:35] <Cale> (The obvious factor of 12 comes from not having to train your fingers to play in each key separately, they're all the same)
[04:01:08] <Cale> But also, there are advantages to being able to get some rhythm going in your fingers and move your hands to change where a chord is placed without changing its quality

[05:16:52] <Cale> It's different, but I think one would pick it up pretty quickly, though it might be more comfortable to use layouts of a different style
[05:18:07] <Cale> There's one where the / axis is the "sharp" semitone and \ is the "flat" semitone and you have whole tones going across, and it seems like people who already play piano are pretty damn good at it after only a short while

[08:37:03] <Galois> it sounds weird, but ... doing the proofs with total rigor and no hand-waving whatsoever is so painful that you are basically forced to apply extreme ingenuity if you want an actually viable proof. This forces you to think extremely hard about how to prove something, even if it's very simple. You reach understanding level 1000 very quickly.
[08:37:51] <frelleck> sounds unpleasant
[08:38:16] <Galois> the process may be slightly unpleasant. The results are very pleasant. No pain, no gain.
[08:40:35] <Galois> For example, I now understand that the quickest way to prove the binomial coefficient rigorously (namely "n choose k = n!/(k! (n-k)!)") is to prove Pascal's identity combinatorially and then inductively construct Pascal's triangle.

[08:53:56] <Galois> I've learned how to prove the boring steps efficiently, and can more or less get on with more serious math now
[08:54:18] <frelleck> int-e I bet those proofs can't be done using software either
[08:54:34] <frelleck> I don't really know though
[08:54:44] <Galois> in the simple stuff that I do I obviously haven't encountered any proofs that have holes, but I have gained a much greater clarity of understanding about what the hidden steps are
[08:54:48] <int-e> frelleck: the basic results that have been checked and rechecked again by literally millions of people (who went through undergrad)... noone expects to find mistakes in those anymore, except due to sloppy writing
[08:55:03] <Fangs> without being too fancy, a lot of programmers seems to rely on compilers to catch most mistakes as a first pass, so they're probably a lot more reliable than you give them credit for
[08:55:07] <Galois> I _have_ found omissions in Rudin, where he left out much more than he intended
[08:55:15] <frelleck> Rudin is known for that
[08:56:02] <int-e> frelleck: it's daunting, but it's a great goal to work forward to
[08:56:19] <frelleck> have they found any major errors yet?
[08:56:24] <frelleck> in research
[08:56:39] <Galois> the point is the capability of the software is not a static entity. The difficulty of coding a proof is not static. Both things improve over time as the software improves, as people improve, as proofs improve.
[08:57:03] <em> Yeah it's very impressive.
[08:57:30] <em> if people are not confident that a proof made by humans is correct, then how can they be more certain that software made to check proofs that was made by humans is correct?
[08:58:11] <Galois> the software is one thing, you check it once.
[08:58:18] <Galois> proofs are many things, you have to check each new proof as it comes out
[08:58:23] <frelleck> it seems like a horror show to try to encode geometric arguments
[08:58:51] <frelleck> things like combinatorics would be a lot easier
[09:00:00] <int-e> frelleck: so there's a challenge in making it nicer. a great research project.
[09:00:03] <em> But -- Stipulating that software like Coq is flawless (and I do expect that it is), then if you feed a proof that can only be understood by 2 humans on earth to Coq and the software tells you "Yes this is a good proof, the theorem is true" that's clearly something good, but it's still only understood by two people I think.
[09:00:32] <int-e> em: It's all about increasing trust, not about having absolute certainty.
[09:00:53] <Galois> the thing is, anyone can run through the Coq proof and see each step. It's completely transparent.
[09:01:06] <Galois> it's not like the software is just a black box that outputs true or false
[09:01:14] <Galois> you can see the state of the software as it's running
[09:01:26] <Galois> stop at any point, examime state, rewind, fast forward, etc.
[09:01:41] <frelleck> if people just checked their proofs with the same effort that it would take to program it, this wouldn't be needed
[09:01:44] <em> I think there should be another dimension of math that should be given more respect/weight which would be how to explain and understand math and see what things mean, not just what is true.
[09:02:01] <int-e> em: For example, while Coq almost certainly has bugs, there are design principles that reduce their impact on the correctness of proofs. But perhaps more importantly, it seems unlikely that there's a bug that goes unnoticed through the development of basic math as we know it and then suddenly manifests in, say, a verification of the Kepler conjecture.
[09:02:19] <Galois> I disagree. The software makes things _easier_ to achieve rigor because you are much more sure your steps are correct.
[09:02:39] <em> From that point of view, if you knew the Twin Primes conjecture was true because a computer had proven it, but it was human unreadable, it might not make any real difference. It's not like most people think it's false right?
[09:02:41] <Galois> The point is that you don't have to put in enormous effort into checking your proof. You can spend that effort instead on coming up with the proof.
[09:02:47] <int-e> em: Once the program code is easier to understand than the thing you verfiy using it, you benefit greatly.
[09:03:18] <Galois> it's theoretically possible to create a human unreadable proof using the software (the software is turing complete), but this never happens in reality
[09:04:13] <eliasy> I never used Coq, but one thing that I notice frequently is that, even for easier stuff, once you program and test it, it is far less likely than a human to produce errors. It is trivial now to recheck solution to integrals using software like WolframAlpha. There only very few equations that alpha cannot understand or solve
[09:04:30] <int-e> There's also some diversity in the area... besides Coq, there's HOL4, Mizar, Isabelle, and a few more practical, perhaps less trustworthy like ACL2.
[09:04:35] <em> I know this is getting a bit far afield, but there may never be a better moment for me to ask and I've been wondering a lot the lat few days -- It seems very likely that in the not so distant future, A.I. could advance to the point that it does a lot of what mathematicians are doing now.
[09:04:40] <em> Isn't that kind of scary?
[09:05:00] <frelleck> not as scary as the fact that I'll be dead before that ;)
[09:05:20] <frelleck> but seriously that would be pretty cool
[09:05:27] <em> If AI could do math better than any human like it can play go better than any human? I would feel we have lost something very important. We'd know all kinds of things are true, or maybe be surprised, maybe we could understand some of those proofs, but it wouldn't be the same anymore.
[09:05:30] <frelleck> you could just type in a conjecture and see if it's true
[09:05:51] <em> frelleck: I think you have a good chance of being alive when this happens.
[09:06:19] <em> unless maybe you are 80 years old (if you are that's cool. I respect that.)

[09:06:29] <frelleck> I'm 103 :(
[09:06:37] <Galois> once you understand the software, a proof in the software conveys much more explanatory insight than a normal proof.
[09:06:48] <em> That's rough but I respect you being able to switch to Libera.chat at your age.
[09:06:54] <int-e> em: And there are projects that work on extracting proofs from those systems and try to replay them on others. It's *really* hard, but the payoff would be another huge leap in trust in the mechanical proofs.

[09:07:18] <lavadonut> do you think AI just pops out of the ether?
[09:07:28] <eliasy> em: this will probably gonna happen. Stanislaw Ulam predicted this half a century ago. I find this desirable, because I can understand code far easier than I can understand math notation/proofs. Code has much less ambiguity.
[09:07:39] <frelleck> it's hard to predict how long it will take
[09:07:49] <frelleck> surely 1000 years from now mathematicians will be obsolete
[09:08:01] <Galois> but the whole point of Coq is that code is math proofs. If you understand code then you understand (properly formatted) math proofs.
[09:08:07] <frelleck> but it's less clear if it will happen in the next few decades... I haven't heard of too many interesting computer-generated proofs

[11:51:45] <turlando> Hello everyone. I'm struggling with a supposedly simple thing. I'm reading that the Z transform is the Fourier transform for sequences when z is the points of a unit radius circumference. So far so good. I'm reading that the Z transform of {x[n]} is the Fourier transform for sequences of {z[n] r^(-n)} if z = r e^(j𝜔). I don't understand why this is true

[12:02:59] <dila> turlando: actually i can't help, sorry
[12:03:00] <turlando> I was trying to understand that by substitution as follows: X(𝛺) = 𝛴 x[n] e^(-j𝛺n). X(z) = 𝛴 x[n] z^(-n). Then when 𝛺 = [-pi, +pi] then e^(-j𝛺n) must be equal to z^(-n). But that doesn't lead to the result from my textbook
[12:03:23] <turlando> No worries dila
[12:05:00] <riv> if z = r e^(j𝜔) then z^(-n) = r^(-n) e^(- j w n)
[12:05:26] <riv> you have e^(-j𝛺n) omega instead of w, and no r^(-n) term
[12:10:46] <turlando> Thank you riv, I was making a very silly mistake since I was equating z and not z^(-n). But now I'm missing the last step. Why Z{x[n]} = Z{x[n] r^(-n)}? In order to elide the r term shouldn't it be r^n?
[12:10:50] *** Quits: acd (~acd@45.132.115.75) (Ping timeout: 268 seconds)
[12:11:27] <turlando> Sorry, I meant F{x[n] r^(-n) and not Z{x[n] r^(-n)
[12:11:37] <turlando> missing brackets also
[12:11:53] <riv> well you can factor out the r^(-n) term since everything is multiplied by it
[12:11:59] <riv> but unless r=1 it can't be gotten rid of
[12:12:57] <turlando> Right, so if I understand correctly riv, under the assumption the complex domain of a FT is the unit circumference then the sign of the exponentiation doesn't matter, right?
[12:13:17] <turlando> I mean, for the FT r must always be 1, if I understand correctlyu
[12:13:38] <riv> im not sure about that
[12:13:47] <turlando> me neither lol
[12:14:41] <turlando> What I'm trying to understand is why Z{x[n]} = F{x[n] r^(-n)}. Seems obvious from my textbook but it isn't for me right now
[12:15:39] <riv> ah
[12:17:03] <riv> so the discrete fourier transform F{x[n] r^(-n)} = sum x[n] r^(-n) e^(- w n)
[12:17:09] <riv> just applying the defintion
[12:17:45] <turlando> I think it's missing a j at the exponential but yep
[12:17:53] <riv> and Z{x[n]} = sum x[n] z^(-n) = sum x[n] r^(-n) e^(- i w n)
[12:18:02] <riv> oops, thanks!
[12:18:19] <riv> but yes setting z = r e^(j w) does equate these
[12:18:35] <riv> and there's no trick to it, just expand out the definition of both
[12:19:25] <turlando> Ohhhhhh! That's right. It's so clear! thank you a lot riv. I actually tried doing exactly that like 30 mins ago but I guess I need some coffee :)
[12:19:36] <turlando> Thank you really a lot, I feel so stupid right now lol

[17:23:29] <Z-module> wakeup: this master's thesis has zillions of examples of continuous nowhere-differentiable functions and is highly readable:   http://ltu.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1022983/FULLTEXT01
[17:24:14] <Plazma> wow that's the fanciest masters thesis i've seen
[17:24:17] <Plazma> al graphical and shit
[17:26:12] <Z-module> It's really nice in a lot of ways (though I'd do a bunch of typesetting improvements, personally)
[17:26:32] <Plazma> yea i see what you mean as i get a tad into it, but, the title page is fancy
[17:27:40] <Z-module> I really dislike the TeX-default of putting page numbers as a centered thing at the bottom, in math. It's visually distracting/confusing when there are other numbers all over the pages.
[17:28:31] <int-e> Fangs: the computation (after cleanup) looks like this: https://paste.debian.net/1201634/
[17:29:01] <Plazma> Z-module: yea i prefer right corner myself, also what drives me nuts too is when you do footnotes, and it's put right next to an equation
[17:29:09] <Plazma> so you can't tell if it's an exponent or a footnote reference
[17:29:25] <Plazma> i was editing a book for a friend that had a lot of that, drove me nuts
[17:29:48] <int-e> Fangs: anyway, this shows that in the free group over two elements, [a,b]^2 is not a commutator, since we can map a to f1 and b to f2 (whatever those elements are, precisely), and that would map a commutator equal to [a,b]^2 to a commutator in that SmallGroup(96,3) thing.

[17:46:42] <Fangs> not much honestly
[17:46:43] <Z-module> dila, some math people, I think a majority (?), require rings to have 1 (a multiplicative identity) by definition, but certainly not all do.
[17:47:08] <Z-module> don't call 1 the "unit", though. In rings, a "unit" is any element at all with a two-sided multiplicative inverse.
[17:47:28] <Z-module> (you can use "unity" I guess, but I find it a silly word... just call it "1", most of the time)
[17:47:57] <int-e> "ring with units" :P
[17:48:26] <dila> well that's quite strange because that would mean by book is talking about a field?
[17:48:31] <int-e> (it works because... any invertible element multiplied by its inverse gives you the identity element ;)
[17:48:45] <dila> oh now i'm confused. it says "commutative ring with identity" not a commutative ring with unit
[17:48:50] <dila> thanks for clarification Z-module
[17:49:14] <Z-module> I was very amused to find out not long ago that the additive group Q/Z can be given a multiplication that makes it a rng (a ring without 1) that isn't just the stupid all-products-are-0 multiplication.
[17:49:17] <int-e> yes, I agree; identity is the right word
[17:50:05] <Z-module> really, people who work in algebra all the time just call it "ring with 1", or more often, just "ring"
[17:50:19] <loopspace> Might be interesting to collect, say, the top 10 rings (groups, etc) that people should know thoroughly as a source of examples/counterexamples
[17:50:21] <Z-module> words like "identity" and "unity" take too long
[17:52:19] <Z-module> other than the 1 issue, pretty much everyone agrees about all the other ring axioms. Except.......................... there are also non-associative rings, most importantly Lie algebras.
[17:52:44] <Fangs> often you call things non-unital rings I thought
[17:53:07] <Fangs> Z-module: whats that Q/Z thing?
[17:53:32] <Z-module> anyway, having a 1 has a very handy property for lots of things. All nonzero rings with 1 have a maximal ideal, for example, which you can't say about rngs in general.  ("rng" = ring not assumed to have 1)

[19:51:04] <Koen> because we want to be able to say that the middle path is close too
[19:51:10] <rubiksdream> ah yes
[19:51:22] <Koen> Guest9: yes but since log is a very well-known function, we already know whether log is injective or not
[19:51:24] <rubiksdream> although we do sorta get that for free
[19:51:35] <Koen> yes
[19:51:45] <rubiksdream> it satisfies sup_{t \in [0,1]} |gamma_{s_1}(t) - gamma_{middle}(t)| < epsilon/2 already, no?
[19:51:55] <Koen> hmmm
[19:51:58] <Guest9> ok, but what is injective function, how to identify whether any function is injective or not? example n^2
[19:52:02] <Koen> I would say < epsilon, not < epsilon/2
[19:52:30] <rubiksdream> but its the midpoint of the linesegment between gamma_{s_1}(t) and gamma_{s_2}(t)
[19:52:38] <rubiksdream> which has length half of whatever the length of that line segment is
[19:52:42] <rubiksdream> and the length of that line segment is < epsilon
[19:52:45] <Koen> the square function is not injective Guest9, for instance 3^2 = (-3)^2 yet 3 is not equal to -3
[19:52:50] <Koen> but log is injective
[19:53:29] <Koen> you can identify that a function is not injective by finding at least one counterexample (like 3,-3 for the square)
[19:53:37] <Guest9> to find out injective mostly negative signs are used on each side?
[19:53:41] <Guest9> or there are other ways to test?
[19:53:46] <Koen> for the square yes, for other functions no
[19:55:06] <Koen> rubiksdream: you can build a "middle path" by defining middle(t) = middle of linesegment(gamma_s1(t), gamma_s2(t)), yes, but there is no guarantee that this "middle path" is gamma_((s1+s2)/2)
[19:55:37] <Koen> and I thought you were talking about gamma_((s1+s2)/2) when you said "middle path" before, hence my confusion
[19:56:34] <Koen> Guest9: the "general" way of checking whether a function f is injective or not, is to solve the two-variables equation f(x) = f(y)
[19:56:46] <rubiksdream> ah okay
[19:56:57] <rubiksdream> yes i wrote gamma_{s_1}(t) + gamma_{s_2}(t) / 2
[19:57:05] <Koen> okay
[19:57:19] <Koen> so we take all the balls of radius 2epislon centered on the middle path
[19:57:43] <Koen> that's an open cover
[19:57:47] <Koen> then we extract a finite subcover?
[19:58:16] <Koen> that might not be good enough
[19:59:13] <Koen> maybe we need a new argument like find eta such that forall s, forall t1, t2,   |t1 - t2| < eta => |gamma_s(t1) - gamma_s(t2)| < epsilon

[19:59:50] <Koen> then we split [0, 1] into n = ceil(1/eta) linesegments of equal length
[20:00:15] <Koen> and that gives us n+1 points on the middle-curve
[20:00:32] <Koen> an then we throw the triangular inequality all over the place to satisfy the non-empty requirement
[20:00:44] <rubiksdream> yeah thats something like what i tried
[20:00:53] <Guest9> 3(m) symbols then 2^3(2^m) possible sequence, how?
[20:00:56] <rubiksdream> couldnt exactly get it to work, but ill see if i can incorporate the new condition

[20:01:49] *** Joins: amahl (~amahl@dsl-jklbng12-54fbca-64.dhcp.inet.fi)
[20:02:12] <rubiksdream> actually another problem i run into is, when i take a cover of gamma_{middle} im not exactly sure why its also a cover of gamma_{s_i}, i=1,2
[20:02:25] <rubiksdream> intuitively if s_1-s_2 is small enough it will be
[20:02:28] <Koen> yes
[20:03:02] <rubiksdream> okay so maybe we do need to adjust |s_1-s_2|
[20:03:23] <rubiksdream> fortunately that is okay, i didnt say we could in the problem statement, but that modification doesnt effect what i really want to prove
[20:03:30] <rubiksdream> which is something that this is a subproblem of
[20:04:15] <Koen> for every t, |gamma_s1(t) - gamma_s2(t) | < epsilon, and |gamma_s1(t) - middle(t)| = |gamma_s1(t) - gamma_s2(t)| / 2
[20:05:27] <Koen> so for every t, gamma_s1(t) is in the ball of radius 2epsilon centered in middle(t)
[20:05:33] <Koen> however
[20:05:45] <Koen> (and so is gamma_s2(t))
[20:05:51] <Koen> however, we want a finite number of balls
[20:06:19] <rubiksdream> right the finite part is the issue
[20:06:30] <rubiksdream> also just realized what i said is sorta nonsense, we cant change s_1,s_2 post defining the middle path
[20:06:45] <Koen> which is why you need to divide [0, 1] into segments of length eta, with an eta sufficiently small so that |middle(t1) - middle(t2)| < epsilon for every t1 and t2 such that |t1-t2| < eta
[20:07:30] <Koen> so when you're looking at gamma_s1(t), it's close to middle(t), which is close to middle(k eta) for some k
[20:08:16] <Koen> here you use the triangular inequality, and perhaps we should have used epsilon/2 instead of epsilon at some point
[20:11:30] <rubiksdream> okay, so we take balls centered at these points

[22:46:18] <nejimban> Guest9: choose one item, then a second one (from the remaining items), then a third one… until you have chosen k items, and forget about the order in which you have taken them
[22:46:43] <nejimban> there are k! different orders in which you can choose the same items
[22:46:58] *** Parts: savask (~savask@Powder/Developer/savask) ()
[22:47:21] <nejimban> so if there are n items in total, that's n ·(n-1)···(n-k+1) / k! combinations
[22:48:14] <em> And that numerator is n!/(n-k)!
[22:48:50] <em> nejimban: I think your explanation is good.

[22:51:28] <em> And in the case of combinations we don't care about the order, so the sets of the same items in different orderings are being grouped together and thought of as one, which is why you divide by k!
[22:54:08] <em> So n! is the number of different ways to arrange n items when the order matters, but if you want to just arrange k of those n items, that's n(n-1)(n-2)..(n-k+1)

[22:55:38] <em> n! is n(n-1)(n-2)(n-3)...3*2*1    and (n-k)! is (n-k)(n-k-1)(n-k-2)...3*2*1  so to cancel out the unneeded terms from n! you divide by (n-k)! to get the desired n(n-1)(n-2)..(n-k+1)
[22:56:01] <arseniiv> Guest9: also you could derive any of them from recurrence relations via e. g. induction, which isn’t novel but the relations themselves have a nice combinatorial interpretation
[22:56:01] <arseniiv> C(n, k) = C(n−1, k) + C(n−1, k−1) corresponds to a way to generate all subsets of {1, …, n} which have k elements: either we take a subset of {1, …, n−1} with k elements (and that’s all) or we take a subset of {1, …, n−1} with k−1 elements and add to it the element n
[22:56:01] <arseniiv> those two are the only ways to go from n−1 to n here. Now we only need to include base cases which are C(0, 0) = 1 (an empty set and its unique empty subset) and C(0, k) = 0 for k ≠ 0 (there are no subsets with k ≠ 0 in an empty set)
[22:56:01] <arseniiv> you can have neat combinatorial correspondences for *any* formula in combinatorics this way, for example you could try to make sense of Fibo(n) = C(n, 0) + C(n−1, 1) + C(n−2, 2) + …
