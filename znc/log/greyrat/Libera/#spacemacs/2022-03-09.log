[14:57:35] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> Anyway, because the Spacemacs convention appears to be `~` for keys and `=` it would probably be easiest to map `~` to <kbd> tags (and only when there is Spacedocs enrichment for it)...
[15:05:30] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> @lebensterben I think the 'default' scratch buffer mode really should be `lisp-interaction-mode`, just like in vanilla Emacs. Unlike `emacs-lisp-mode`, it automatically 'activates' lexical-binding. Instead of letting users find such things out after doing things the wrong way for a long time (like me), I would prefer to provide the best option by default (again, like vanilla Emacs). If users want to have it 
[15:05:30] <FromGitter> ... opened in text-mode then thay can use `dotspacemacs-scratch-mode`. What do you think?

[21:09:42] <FromGitter> <bryce-carson> @dalanicolai @lebensterben I agree as well. When I want to open a fundamental or text mode buffer I use `SPC b N n` to just create a new empty buffer. For myself, I changed my scratch buffer to ESS, but that's because I hardly work with elisp and mostly use Emacs for working with R.
[21:10:22] <FromGitter> <bryce-carson> For the default scratch buffer, I do agree it should be most alike vanilla Emacs, and the documentation can make users aware of thr keybinding I mentioned to open a new fundamental buffer.
