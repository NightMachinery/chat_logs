My idea was to make this heart black (the text color basically) when there are no favorites for that item. A colleague of mine says a black heart makes her think of death. Could you guys give your view on this? I am a bit clueless atm

[13:42:02] <[twisti]> is there a way to scale font size (or specify it in a scaling way) ? its weird that i can say that element should be, say, 20% of the width, but then for the text i have to guess at a pt size that fits the smallest resolution and is still readable at max resolution
[13:42:03] <undefined_bob> :)
[13:42:14] <DrowningElysium> Thanks, didn't think of that
[13:46:38] <undefined_bob> [twisti]: you can try it with vw unit
[13:46:58] <undefined_bob> or with Media Queries
[13:48:10] <[twisti]> undefined_bobL you can use vw for font size ? how does that work ?
[13:51:53] <undefined_bob> [twisti]: .yourtextclass {font-size: 3vw;}
[13:51:58] <undefined_bob> for example
[13:52:14] <undefined_bob> you can read more here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15649244/responsive-font-size-in-css
[13:53:03] <undefined_bob> or here https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_responsive_text.asp  (even tho I dont really like w3schools) but I think its okay for an example
[13:53:05] <[twisti]> thats crazy. thanks, that seems perfect

[16:52:34] <[twisti]> undefined_bob: sorry for the late followup, but meetings and fires to put out means i only now got around to reading up some more. i couldnt find out an explanation as to what the given number actually refers, any idea ? like, say font-size: 1vw;, i understand that 1vw means 1% of the viewports width, but what unit is it for the font ? like, line height ? average character width ? something else ?
[16:55:41] <undefined_bob> [twisti]: no problem. I could try to explain it in my own words but here is a better explanation: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Viewport_concepts
[16:56:23] <[twisti]> no, no, im not asking about the viewport aspect, but about what applying viewport width numbers to font size means
[16:57:12] <[twisti]> say i have a vw of 600, so 5vw would be 30; font-size: 5vw is what - font-size: 30pt ? 30px ? +30 ?
[16:57:33] <[twisti]> or is maybe the pixel value not used at all and the font scaled to fill 30px somehow ?
[16:58:13] *** Joins: wovixo (~wovixo@128.104.205.49)
[17:00:02] <undefined_bob> maybe this can help: imagine the viewport was originally 1200 x 800 pixels. We then set up an iframe: iframe {width: 50vw;} If the iframe is set to 50vw, it will be 50% of the width of the 1200px parent document in our example above, or 600px, with 1vw being 6px. When zoomed in, the iframe shrinks to 400px and 1vw becomes 4px.
[17:01:11] <[twisti]> so the result of vw is always in pixels, so in your example, font-size: 1vw is identical to font-size: 4px ?
[17:02:05] <undefined_bob> you can find more explanation and good examples and test cases here: https://css-tricks.com/fun-viewport-units/
[17:02:26] <[twisti]> thanks
[17:02:56] <undefined_bob> in my last example the 1vw only became 4px because the iframe shrink to 400px
[17:04:49] <undefined_bob> 'A vh unit is 1% of the layout viewport's height. Similarly, the vw unit is 1% of the layout viewport's width.'

[17:09:52] <undefined_bob> and I would not say that the 'results of vh or vw' are px. Its more like you can measure the font in px if you want to but the font is still given in vh or wh. Its like you can measure 1 meter in inches or meter or feet but in the end its still a meter

[17:46:09] <dev4449> Hi. good day.
[17:47:05] <dev4449> the learning resource I'm learning css from mentions this: "1 rem is equivalent to the font-size of the root element of the entire HTML document." Is <html> meant by the "root element" ?
[17:58:18] <entuland> yes, <html> is the root element of the document https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/html
[17:59:35] <dev4449> Is my understanding correct? I mean, If we set `font-size` for <html>, then when we use rem, it's relative to that `font-size` value we set for <html>
[18:00:47] <dev4449> And if we don't set any, it is relative to the `font-size` that browser has defined for <html>
[18:01:49] <entuland> that sounds about correct
[18:10:08] <dev4449> Ok. Thanks. I'd appreciate if you confirm that my understanding for `em` is also correct. "em is relative to the font-size of its direct or nearest parent" it means that, we set `font-size` of an element to 2em, it means that the font size of that element is twice as big as the nearest parent element that has a `font-size` defined by the user.
[18:11:42] <entuland> no, that only means "twice the size of the parent's font"
[18:11:48] <entuland> doesn't matter how the parent's font is set
[18:11:55] *** Joins: Cata (~Cata@user/cata)
[18:12:54] <entuland> you should look at "em" as redefining "em" - when you use 2em you are saying "take whatever the value of em is right now here, and double it"
[18:13:20] <entuland> rem does the same thing, only that it queries the em value of the root instead of the em value of the context where your element is placed
[18:19:27] <dev4449> but what if we haven't used `em`  for the parent? for example we set font-size: 20px; for the parent?
[18:19:53] <entuland> doesn't matter
[18:20:04] <entuland> the value of 1em in your case is 20px
[18:20:22] <dev4449> Oh
[18:20:29] <entuland> so setting 2em would give you a visible result of 40px
[18:20:57] <entuland> similar reasoning go with % values
[18:22:52] <dev4449> Aha, I think I got it.
[18:27:52] <dev4449> I will try all these on codepen to learn more effectively. thanks.
