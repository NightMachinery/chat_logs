[02:58:42] <dVVilly> Hey #archlinux. Unsure if I've come across a bug with the containerd / docker package or whether I'm missing something. Installed docker (sudo pacman -Syu docker) and enabled it. Unable to start it through systemd and journalctl advises that containerd's binary isn't in PATH. I checked /usr/bin/ for containerd and it's not there. I ran sudo pacman -Syu containerd and it ran through a re-installation 
[02:58:48] <dVVilly> without error. sudo systemctl enable containerd runs fine, but systemctl start containerd also says containerd isn't in PATH.

[04:59:52] <thrice> ah
[05:00:41] <Betal> thrice: maybe I should report, what if the fix is obvious :P
[05:00:46] <Ghosthree3> obviously something else installed on your machine, OR its a hardware bug. can you reproduce it in a VM with identical package installation
[05:01:07] <Ghosthree3> (bug caused by your hardware*)
[05:01:07] <Toorero> Namarrgon: Ups you're right....
[05:01:17] <Toorero> thx

[05:13:28] <Toorero> Namarrgon so does this mean the parent subvolume and the respective copy need to have the same UUID?

[05:14:36] *** Quits: nyah (~nyah@05453449.skybroadband.com) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[05:15:24] <Toorero> so something like `btrfs -v send /PREFIX/2022-02-16_14-00-01/@ | btrfs -v receive /PREFIX2/2022-02-16_14-00-01` does not guarantee that they have the same UUID? :O
[05:17:14] <Namarrgon> you can't identify a subvolume by the filename, "D2022-02-16_14-00-01" means nothing, the UUIDs are important
[05:18:03] <Toorero> Yeah I get that but I'm somewhat staggered that the normal send/receive does not keep the UUID
[05:18:34] <Toorero> or perhaps I generated that backup a weird way, perhaps... I'm going to test that
[05:18:34] <Namarrgon> it does but if the parent is modified inbetween then you're out of luck
[05:18:56] <Namarrgon> look at the "received UUID" on the receiving side
[05:19:07] <Toorero> they are different, yes
[05:19:30] <Namarrgon> then you either have the wrong subvolume or one of them was modified
[05:19:36] <Namarrgon> or both of them
[05:19:41] <Toorero> they are both readonly
[05:19:55] <Toorero> mhh
[05:20:03] <Namarrgon> that doesn't mean much, you can set a subvolume RW, modify it and then set it RO again
[05:20:18] <Toorero> I surly did not do that
[05:20:30] <Namarrgon> who created them? you or snapper?
[05:20:38] <Toorero> myself
[05:21:35] <Toorero> i worte a script that just creates a readonly variant of all my timeshift backups and then copies them over but they can't be copied recursivly because of the aforementioned error
[05:22:03] <Toorero> ok I'm recreating the process manually and see if I succed then there is an error in my script somewhere

[08:14:14] <feinedsquirrel> yeah, I realized between posting that when it was returning a lenght of "2", it was just saying err_code is 2 chars long: % and ?. the expansion was happening when I stuck it in ${}. Been trying a few options.

Using your suggestion, I put err_code="${#?}" in the prompt hook precmd function, then included its expansion at the end of my PS1 as a quick and dirty test to see if it prints 2, or 3, with different error codes. Now I just need to test if that is a numerical value or a string. Should be numerical, because

[08:32:47] <feinedsquirrel> yep, the test just worked. I'll still ask over on #zsh to see if anyone can explain the difference between using #? and $#%? My gut feeling is the prompt expansion %? does some things differently "in the zsh c code", if extrapolating the answer from https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/579773/difference-between-fcolor-and-fgcolor-in-zsh-prompt/580488 would make sense
[08:32:48] <phrik> Title: Difference between %F{color} and %{$fg[color]%} in zsh prompt - Unix & Linux Stack Exchange (at unix.stackexchange.com)
[08:34:33] <tirnanog> #? is nothing by itself, surely.
[08:34:40] <tirnanog> although, zsh has surprised me before.
[08:35:01] *** Joins: harthan (~harthan@70.33.35.59)
[08:35:28] <tirnanog> stepping back for a moment, ${#name} is a form of parameter expansion that predates zsh. you'll find it in bash and various other shells.
[08:36:16] <tirnanog> zsh's trick here is to be able to support parameter expansion syntax for it's "prompt escapes", apparently. but that's where it comes from.
[08:36:52] <espresso> zsh/bash both do great things with https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Shell-Parameter-Expansion.html
[08:36:53] <phrik> Title: Shell Parameter Expansion (Bash Reference Manual) (at www.gnu.org)
[08:38:55] <tirnanog> feinedsquirrel: putting it another way, how is zsh supposed to know that #? was intended as a parameter expansion of the %? prompt escape? ${#?} is unambiguous in that regard.
[08:38:59] <feinedsquirrel> tirnanog: yeah, I was not being specific, mean to say I'll ask what, if any, difference does ${#?} have from using the prompt escape %? or if they aren't interchangeable at all with what I am trying to do
[08:39:22] <tirnanog> the point I'm making is that ${ ... anything ... } is unambiguously a form of parameter expansion.
[08:39:42] <feinedsquirrel> right. yeah I think I'm following
[08:39:46] <tirnanog> that aspect, at least, is not something that's unique to zsh.
[08:40:44] <feinedsquirrel> yes, I for sure understand that. I've used it in some bash scripts I've written, that had to be bash for portability.
[08:40:54] <tirnanog> a much more banal example would be something like "$foo_bar". should that be an expansion of the variable whose name is foo bar? or an expansion of the variables foo and bar, with an underscore inbetween? that's a situation where you might need braces to render the intent clear.
[08:41:00] <tirnanog> is foo_bar, I mean.
[08:43:04] *** Parts: harthan (~harthan@70.33.35.59) (Leaving)
[08:44:12] <feinedsquirrel> yeah, when I was writing those bash scripts, about halfway through I decided I probably better encase everything in curly braces just so it is explicitly clear what is being expanded as a single variable name
[08:44:13] <tirnanog> anyway, I don't see why #? would ever be taken to be a prompt escape, just as writing #varname wouldn't be treated as a normal expansion. the expectation just doesn't make sense. instead, %{#?} and ${#varname} respectively.
[08:45:03] <tirnanog> I mean, even from my casual skimming of zhsmisc, it's fairly clear that prompt escapes are supposed to lead with %.
[08:45:37] <feinedsquirrel> yes, that is what I was trying to say. That makes sense. But now I'm also wondering, does ${var1,var2} expand two variables? going to try in now
[08:45:59] <feinedsquirrel> right, so it would be $#%?, or, ${#%?}

[08:46:11] <tirnanog> if it does, then let's just say that I would be very content with my decision not to use zsh as an interactive shell ;)
[08:46:18] <tirnanog> it woulud be horrifying.
[08:46:40] <tirnanog> $#%? just looks like gobbldegook.
[08:46:50] <tirnanog> %? is the escape in question.
[08:47:08] <tirnanog> you apply parameter expansion semantics - the ${#name} style PE. so %{#?}.
[08:47:37] <tirnanog> likewise with $? -> ${#?} (which has nothing to do with prompts).
[08:48:51] <feinedsquirrel> just gave echo ${var1,var2} a try. (I had defined var1=1, var2=2) zsh said "bad substitution, and bash just echoed the value of var1, pretended var2 wasn't even there.
[08:48:53] <tirnanog> how you would use that for padding though, I have no idea.

[11:50:54] <jelle> TheArcaneBrony: intentional, so you can install both
[11:51:10] <TheArcaneBrony> hm, its preventing me from uninstalling linux-tkg as it breaks bbswitch and nvidia

[11:52:56] <TheArcaneBrony> im running linux-zen as main kernel
[11:53:10] <jelle> so the problem is that linux-tkg requires linux hmm
[11:53:38] <Namarrgon> why does it provide "linux"? that's just wrong.
[11:53:51] <jelle> TheArcaneBrony: just pacman -Rdd it

[12:58:32] <Repentinus> LordRishav, if you are not using a login manager to launch Sway, then it inherits its settings from the vt used to launch it.
[12:58:49] *** Quits: jumpArtifact (~jumpArtif@user/jumpartifact) (Quit: WeeChat 3.4)
[13:00:22] <Repentinus> So if your vts use C as their locale (check /etc/locale.conf), Sway will use it too unless you specifically override locale environment variables upon launching Sway.
[13:00:48] <LordRishav> BrainDamage: Launching sway is handled by my login shell (zsh) by having exec zsh in ~/.zshenv
[13:01:35] <grawity> of all places .zshenv seems like the weirdest one
[13:02:03] <LordRishav> Repentinus: /etc/locale.conf just has LANG=en_IN.UTF-8 (my preferred locale) in it
[13:02:11] <Tom^> if you actually exec zsh it might be worth knowing all "non" exported variables are lost.

[13:05:53] <jirido> did it hurt?
[13:06:06] <Tom^> grawity: if i understand this right, exec zsh in .zprofile means all non exported variables are lost. does that mean all env vars besides the ones being exported in .zshrc is now lost? meaning his LANG is now "" and it just fallbacks to C
