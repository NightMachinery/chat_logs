[02:45:34] <Hypervisor1> Yes, its called the GOing Dark problem
[02:45:47] <Blondie101010> see a psychiatrist
[02:45:49] <Hypervisor1> The FBI cant crack encryption, so they try to place backdoors in phones, Operating systems, apps etc
[02:45:55] <uoj6wz6qoswb> most goverenments do illegal things to other goverenments all the time most of this software at some point does have to work
[02:45:59] <Hypervisor1> I dont need a 'psychiatrist', I need 4096bit PGP
[02:46:07] <Hypervisor1> right, uo
[02:46:09] <Blondie101010> ok do that then

[02:46:37] <Hypervisor1> You said you have a simple solution, what is it?
[02:46:45] <Hypervisor1> Just a singlehop vpn im guessing?
[02:47:03] <ilikeyou> once you go dark, you..  wait..
[02:47:06] <uoj6wz6qoswb> tor was originally made to let the navy proxy home without being attacked by other goverenments when on shore leave : / so it not working would be a bit dumb
[02:47:21] <Hypervisor1> I agree uo
[02:47:40] <Hypervisor1> I suspect Tor is a giant honeypot at some level
[02:47:54] <ajak> so you're just trolling then
[02:47:57] <Hypervisor1> its a big juicy surveillience network
[02:48:00] <uoj6wz6qoswb> if it is then are all the goverenments allowing drug sales complicit ? :)
[02:48:01] <ajak> because you obviously have a fetish for tor
[02:48:09] <Hypervisor1> Im not trolling, I actually think Tor is a honeypot probably

[02:48:24] <circuitbone> which idiot are we entertaining today?
[02:48:28] <Hypervisor1> I shove onions, up my backdoor, just to honor Tor onion routing
[02:48:39] <Hypervisor1> I think Tor is proabably secure against most people
[02:48:49] <Hypervisor1> But I suspect Tor has a hidden backdoor, called a 'bug'
[02:48:52] <Hypervisor1> when its discovered
[02:49:01] <Hypervisor1> When the backdoor is found, its just called a 'bug'
[02:49:03] <Hypervisor1> And gets fixed
[02:49:10] <Hypervisor1> Then a new Bug finds its way into Tor
[02:49:15] <Hypervisor1> Then that gets discovered, fixed,

[02:49:28] <Hypervisor1> Yes thats exactly how to setup a unattributable backdoor
[02:49:47] <Hypervisor1> It's not a backdoor, its a software vulnerability only the FBI knows about

[02:50:29] <Hypervisor1> But my main point is a Tor backdoor can exist, and simply be called a Bug when found, to dismiss attribution as a backdoor
[02:50:54] <uoj6wz6qoswb> cpu backdoors might exist :O
[02:51:06] <Hypervisor1> Of course
[02:51:12] <Hypervisor1> I was just focusing on Tor Browser/network thoug
[02:51:25] <uoj6wz6qoswb> if you had an ulimited budget and needed a bottle neck why would you even bother targetting software rather than the only three chip providers on the planet
[02:51:32] <Hypervisor1> right

[02:53:52] <Hypervisor1> Trisquel uses old packages
[02:54:00] <Hypervisor1> old packages are more likely to have unpatched vulns
[02:54:10] <Hypervisor1> I prefer more modern, updated packages
[02:54:18] <Hypervisor1> which have greater security and compatability, usually
[02:54:20] <uoj6wz6qoswb> what if the new packages are full of bugs
[02:54:24] <Hypervisor1> thats always possible
[02:54:24] <cryptikulous> lmao
[02:54:27] <uoj6wz6qoswb> and the old ones didnt have any
[02:54:40] <Hypervisor1> New Packages, can have undiscovered bugs, old packages, can have bugs that never get fixe.

[02:54:42] <Hypervisor1> fixed
[02:55:14] <Hypervisor1> New Packges, can have undiscovered bugs,which will probably get fixed, old packages, have more time to discover bugs and patch, but may never get pactched, due to being old packages

[17:10:29] <McQuestionable> Hi all. Anyone here have any experience getting family to use a password manager? Family member just had their ebay password compromised so looking to fix that going forward
[17:11:17] <uoj6wz6qoswb> howd they get compromised ? if it was phishing a password manager does nothing 2fa would be better and makes password reuse irrelivent at the same time
[17:11:38] <tetrapod> Yea just scare 'em into using it. Identity theft usually does the trick.
[17:12:02] <uoj6wz6qoswb> password managers only protect against cred stuffing its not really benificial if they arent using 2fa
[17:12:43] <McQuestionable> Fairly confident it was just a password that they shared across accounts, will double check. brb
[17:13:02] <tetrapod> uoj6wz6qoswb I disagree, most people have like 2 passwords in their life and if forumX gets hacked half of their accounts are compromised.
[17:13:32] <uoj6wz6qoswb> and if their email and accounts using their card have 2fa you only get an alert on login attempts
[17:14:07] <uoj6wz6qoswb> if you get phished your still screwed either way 2fa solves the same problem password managers are designed to fix and provide more security by default
[17:15:00] <uoj6wz6qoswb> i would rather bait a single password just spamming it and have 2fa on all my other accounts then log all alerts to find sources of compromise /shrug
[17:15:33] <uoj6wz6qoswb> be the easiest way to spike db dumps with watermarks to get early alerts on data breeches
[17:16:59] <tetrapod> Also, some family members are still a little scared of their phone and don't like the idea of it preventing them from logging in. In my eyes it's irrational but hey.
[17:17:12] <uoj6wz6qoswb> im more worried about online compromise than offline in terms of just leaving them under the keyboard :) given if you lose the password manager its a list of every account you have full scoping you as a target : / zero sandboxing of contexts
[17:18:01] <uoj6wz6qoswb> if you lose the password manager your fucked : / you can get your phone and number replaced if your doing a <pm> you need a firesafe to hold a redundent copy or its bye bye
[17:18:47] <tetrapod> Or use a cloud solution. Store your keepass db on dropbox or something.
[17:19:20] <uoj6wz6qoswb> and if you forget that password how do you recover ?
[17:20:19] <tetrapod> Me personally, i got them printed on a piece of paper in a safe. But you're right, that is a problem.
[17:20:23] <uoj6wz6qoswb> /shrug personally i think password managers are dumb but im not one of the idiots that does password reuse unless its on purpose :P
[17:21:55] <uoj6wz6qoswb> for a good 2ish years maybe in 2013-2014 i only used account recovery over email and set a new random password i didnt bother remembering, with single password and 2fa on email account
[17:22:22] <uoj6wz6qoswb> you dont even need to store the password manager information if you try hard enough
[17:22:47] <uoj6wz6qoswb> basically works out as smart phone 2fa into email 2fa for all accounts
[17:23:03] <uoj6wz6qoswb> leaving a single password to memorize and a replacable device for recovery

[17:24:03] <tetrapod> uoj6wz6qoswb I agree with you, but people over 50 barey know how to open a 2nd tab in their browser. Password resets and stuff look different on every site and are therefore daunting.
[17:24:57] <uoj6wz6qoswb> that just sounds like an excuse :P i got a 55 year old woman to run archlinux for 2 years
[17:25:08] <tetrapod> yea sure
[17:25:23] <uoj6wz6qoswb> turns out if you write out 10 commands on a piece of paper they can perform mundane simplistic tasks pretty well

[17:28:21] <tetrapod> Hmm, i guess you could see it that way, but it's not how I meant it. It's just that the knowledge gap between people that did not grow up with tech and the people that did can be huge. And it's a fact that older people cannot learn new things as easy as younger people.
[17:28:42] <tetrapod> There are of course outliers.

[17:29:53] <Apachez> since they were even dumbier? ;)
[17:30:10] <uoj6wz6qoswb> and i can take your arguement and imply that using a password manager is to complicated for most users because they wouldnt understand what it is : /
[17:30:41] <tetrapod> Nah they arn't dumb by any means, they're just not irc twats like us.

[17:35:35] <uoj6wz6qoswb> 2fa was out well before password managers : /
[17:35:47] <tetrapod> yes, but not widely adopted.
[17:35:52] <uoj6wz6qoswb> i was using 2fa on a wow account i had nearly 12 years ago ^_^
[17:36:08] <uoj6wz6qoswb> my gaming gold account was more secure than most adults bank accounts
[17:36:38] <uoj6wz6qoswb> you can use password reset over email to create 2fa over email so its been around forever
[17:37:16] <tetrapod> That wasn't your point though.
[17:37:54] <uoj6wz6qoswb> i said before 2fa and single password email used to link other accounts is safer than a password manager which is the entire concept of what i would advice in its place
[17:38:33] <uoj6wz6qoswb> if you lose the password manager its every account and login... game over losing email with a clean inbox still provides obfuscation by not linking all your accounts in one go
