[00:02:00] <grinchrock> get that fake ass L outta here
[00:04:03] <rpifan> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OB7tu4_k6YA
[00:06:54] <rpifan> it used to mean the dark L
[00:06:58] <rpifan> but now it means W in polish
[00:07:11] <rpifan> like in the world little
[00:07:17] <grinchrock> i didnt know polski used those funky characters
[00:07:49] <rpifan> ohhh yes
[00:07:55] <rpifan> ść
[00:08:12] <rpifan> and W is a V not a W
[00:09:14] <grinchrock> pronounced as W tho rite
[00:09:21] <haise01> just got dumped in 2k player queue
[00:09:28] <haise01> I could patch some stuff while I wait
[00:10:01] <rpifan> the ĺ is pronounced W
[00:10:42] <grinchrock> so you're saying all these polish names, Wozniak, Woczinski, Weirzbicki, Jaskeiwtz, etc... 
[00:10:51] <grinchrock> those W's are supposed to be pronounced as V's?

[02:17:17] <sd> 12<y​azarrrs> I am curious why do people not really in corporate environments implement Layer 2 attack mitigations on CISCO switches for example? e.g ARP spoofing/poisoning, MAC Attacks, DHCP Attacks, Spoofing Attacks etc.
[02:17:36] <sd> 06<N​injaStyle> they do sometimes
[02:18:13] <Activ8> they do get implemented sometimes but not all the time depends on who is managing the network
[02:18:20] <sd> 06<N​injaStyle> mostly because they are worried about breaking stuff

[02:19:17] <Activ8> one place I worked at the guy was a ccie and locked the fuck out of everything completely
[02:19:30] <Activ8> every lock you can think of was implimented

[03:19:56] <sd> 06<N​injaStyle> that's what you said, a privesc in chrome would be a sandbox escape
[03:20:04] <sd> 12<y​azarrrs> Like its a fullchain exploit
[03:20:11] <sd> 12<y​azarrrs> need minimum 3 bugs in each
[03:20:19] <sd> 12<y​azarrrs> usually its more like 4-9 bugs
[03:20:25] <sd> 06<N​injaStyle> you dont necessarily need lpe
[03:20:28] <sd> 12<y​azarrrs> All cbhained together
[03:20:32] <sd> 06<N​injaStyle> depends how the sandbox escape works
[03:20:36] <sd> 12<y​azarrrs> Well for 0 click you do
[03:20:42] <sd> 06<N​injaStyle> not necessarily
[03:21:07] <sd> 06<N​injaStyle> sometimes the sandbox escape is a kernel exploit, but you often need a leak for kernel memory addresses
[03:21:19] <sd> 06<N​injaStyle> so that's why it still is typically is several vulns
[03:21:31] <sd> 12<y​azarrrs> Yeah but its pretty rare where it's info disclosure in mojo

[03:22:50] <sd> 12<y​azarrrs> Where it starts

[03:23:09] <sd> 06<N​injaStyle> the initial bug needs to be in the chrome codebase, the RCE would typically be within the JS engine, so yeah
[03:23:11] <sd> 12<y​azarrrs> To get to the sandbox
[03:23:14] <sd> 06<N​injaStyle> right
[03:23:23] <sd> 06<N​injaStyle> but to escape it, you get a lot more options.
[03:23:43] <sd> 12<y​azarrrs> Yeah usually OOB/UAF's are common
[03:23:44] <sd> 06<N​injaStyle> downside is that chrome also utilizes a lot of the built in Windows exploit mitigations by default
[03:23:55] <sd> 06<N​injaStyle> so it gets extra tricky
[03:24:12] <sd> 12<y​azarrrs> But a good thing with edge is its Super Duper Mode

[03:24:46] <sd> 12<y​azarrrs> decreases the attack surface by alot
[03:24:52] <sd> 12<y​azarrrs> well about 40%
[03:24:56] <sd> 12<y​azarrrs> better than nothing
[03:25:28] <sd> 06<N​injaStyle> we also did a whole chain in edge, pre-chrome engine switchover
[03:25:41] <sd> 06<N​injaStyle> that one was hard as shit because of the exploit mitigations

[04:53:09] <DoTheNeedful> FLY FACT: Unlike other insects that have two pairs of wings, house fly has only one pair of membranous wings. Second pair of wings is reduced and looks like a pair of miniature drumsticks. This pair of wings (known as halters) is used for balancing during the flying process.

[09:27:06] <Work-BWMerlin> My favourite style is that they are labelled and correct, after that everything else is icing on top
[09:27:20] <Cl0udNinja> double bonus if you print the label on both ends of the label so that you dont have to turn the flag to see it
[09:27:28] <sd> 07<n​ullrend> eh, I've used painter's tape but I'm looking for something a bit nicer. Doesn't have to be printed

[14:01:56] <teh_f4ll3n> I don't like how expensive Intel NUCs are :(
[14:02:16] <Hunterkll> you pay extra for the formfactor
[14:02:21] <Hunterkll> just like with other fancy products ;)
[14:03:01] <teh_f4ll3n> that's what I mean. same gear in a normal mini-ITX would cost close to half of a NUC
[14:03:24] <teh_f4ll3n> 60% maybe
[14:05:22] <Hunterkll> not getting the same size benefit, and also probably not intel designed boards saves ya money

[14:06:40] <CoJaBo> CptLuxx: A lot of those smaller ones have the only other SATA port on the m.2 or whatever, which requires an adaptor that ocasionally is bigger than the main board to break it out =D

[14:11:36] <Hunterkll> teh_f4ll3n: 7th gen's the lowest I can really go for performance reasons at any rate, anything else just absolutely *blows chunks* perf wise in my security configuration if it's below that

[14:11:45] <Hunterkll> lol

[14:12:18] <teh_f4ll3n> Hunterkll, yeah, but even if it's 7th gen... it's a 260U it'll blow chunks regardlesss
[14:12:48] <Hunterkll> it'd be better performance then what i'm running virtual right now ....
[14:12:54] <Hunterkll> 1vCPU :P
[14:12:56] <teh_f4ll3n> fair
[14:13:51] <Hunterkll> the physical i have right now, the E6520, is unbearably slow to use interactively if i have the hardware reliant security features turned on 
[14:14:01] <Hunterkll> to the point of causing auth failures and shit
[14:14:01] <Hunterkll> lol
[14:14:18] <Hunterkll> it is like a 2nd gen i7 or i5 however
[14:14:42] <Hunterkll> so quite understandable that a 30% CPU perf hit on server 2019 and server 2022 is obscenely noticable 
[14:14:57] <Hunterkll> and only 8GB ram, i believe so it's pretty much running at 90% usage constantly
[14:15:18] <Hunterkll> can't even get the ATA agent to function reliably in a virtual without 6GB ram minimum, and that's before I throw ATP and stuff at it

[15:25:13] <tarek58> i remember the comic chat thing vagueeeely
[15:25:15] <Hunterkll> no, comic chat can connect to IRC servers and work just fine
[15:25:16] <Hunterkll> ;)
[15:25:27] <tarek58> well, telnet.exe is good enough, because you can IRC through a telnet client if you know the commands and do PONG replies quick enough.
[15:25:34] <Hunterkll> well, it gets a bit snippy these days, but it's pure basic IRC with some extra shit thrown into the /say for the character poses
[15:25:40] <Hunterkll> so it's a bit noisy for non-comic chat users
[15:25:43] <tarek58> we should all install WIn95 and use telnet.exe from now on
[15:25:58] <Hunterkll> microsoft also used to ship an IRC server as part of exchange
[15:26:23] <tarek58> ok now that I did not know, and that must've been incredibly cool.
[15:26:42] <tarek58> for the techs of a larger company
[15:26:49] <tarek58> 'hey man u wanna see Clerks'
[15:26:58] <Hunterkll> it was for inter-office chat stuff
[15:27:02] <tarek58> 'no dude, been fighting with the tape backup all day'
[15:27:05] <Hunterkll> had logging on the exchange side, could web-view previoius chats, etc

[15:27:28] <Hunterkll> that's what the raw connection looks like
[15:27:37] <tarek58> that is cnie
[15:27:38] <tarek58> nice
[15:27:50] <tarek58> Looks like you left the default MOTD in place too, which was a good toufh
[15:27:51] <tarek58> touch
[15:27:56] <Hunterkll> lol
[15:28:14] <tarek58> See, things used to be cool.
[15:28:17] <Hunterkll> IRCX - microsoft's extension of IRC - was implemented on it
[15:28:23] <Hunterkll> which introduced things like.... SASL authentication!
[15:28:39] <tarek58> things used to be cool.  
[15:28:45] <Hunterkll> eventually became part of regular IRC standards
[15:28:46] <Hunterkll> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IRCX
[15:28:51] <tarek58> there will be no such thing as in 2040, installing VMs from the 2020 version of htings
[15:28:53] <Hunterkll> it was to replace the earlier microsoft inter-office IM/chat system
[15:28:57] <teh_f4ll3n> Like duke nukem. he used to be cool too
[15:29:05] <tarek58> because the 2021 office365 will not be online any longer
[15:29:18] <Hunterkll> you.... can install the office builds offline just fine....
[15:29:27] <Hunterkll> they don't need online components to operate, and work just fine with on-premise systems 
[15:29:28] <Hunterkll> lol
[15:29:51] <Hunterkll> hehe
[15:29:52] <Hunterkll> https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions//cc767140(v=technet.10)?redirectedfrom=MSDN
[15:30:00] <Hunterkll> microsoft documentation that references EFnet and such
[15:30:16] <Hunterkll> but yea, think about that
[15:30:33] <Hunterkll> the reason you use SASL to log into libera instead of something else is because of something microsoft did ~24 years ago
[15:30:41] <tarek58> Yep
[15:30:57] <tarek58> All things considered, Microsoft has a better track record for me than apple
[15:31:06] <tarek58> I'd work for MS
[15:31:09] <tarek58> Not for apple
[15:31:29] <Hunterkll> I'd kill to work for apple, on the OS / software engineering side anyway, working at an actual UNIX vendor would be awsome
[15:31:40] <Hunterkll> and basically, that's only Apple, IBM, Oracle, and a handful of other small fry left 
[15:32:22] <estranger> I'd work for msft or apple before Google 
[15:32:31] <tarek58> facebook
[15:32:35] <tarek58> sorry, meta.
[15:32:44] <Hunterkll> true that, but it's not a tech thing with google sadly - they do some really awsome shit
[15:32:44] <Hunterkll> it's the 
[15:32:54] <estranger> I can't see myself working at any of those though, fuck that at this point of my career
[15:32:58] <Hunterkll> "I don't know if my team or product will exist in 3 months even though we just launched it" factor that keeps me away from google
[15:33:11] <tarek58> yeah that's a pretty crappy factor
[15:33:15] <estranger> msft could be a maybe. they are a good place to work
[15:33:38] <estranger> apple has some really cool tech stacks and smart folks
[15:33:47] <teh_f4ll3n> feels so good to delete arsehole customer's data
[15:33:51] <Hunterkll> that, and they're the largest unix vendor in the world
[15:33:52] <Hunterkll> lol
[15:34:15] <estranger> i know people who went to msft and apple later in their career... no one to google
[15:34:34] <Hunterkll> man
[15:34:38] <Hunterkll> this feels like a fucking hunt

[17:47:14] <SirSantalot> it happened on completely stock and clean installs too, pretty much right out of the box

[17:48:07] <SirSantalot> with o365, that didn't seem possible or relevant
[17:48:24] <SirSantalot> eventually involved our MSP

[17:48:38] <SirSantalot> involved regular ms support

[20:22:10] <Activ8> I have to deal with that sometimes but it's usually if the password gets changed on the account that's in the scanner settings to email
[20:23:18] <SantasWiFi> Activ8: almost bought that precision 7050 micro but i chickened out
[20:23:25] <SantasWiFi> cause i read bad things about OpenBSD and USB NICs lol
[20:23:39] <Activ8> do you really need more than 1 nic though if it's just for testing
[20:23:59] <SantasWiFi> its for my homelab setup

[20:24:25] <Activ8> could you not have added a small height quad nic
[20:24:34] <SantasWiFi> when all it does is pfsense and fileserver and irc basically
[20:24:44] <Activ8> I bet you could have added a quad nic the the system
[20:24:53] <SantasWiFi> yeah I looked for SFF too but couldn't find any
[20:25:00] <SantasWiFi> not the micros, not without some serious modding
[20:25:10] <Activ8> damn
[20:25:15] <Activ8> never mind back to the drawing board
[20:25:18] <SantasWiFi> rip
[20:25:39] <SantasWiFi> small form factor machines come with standard PSUs that aren't super efficeint at low power draw compared to the micros
[20:26:06] <SantasWiFi> I don't think, that's the theory anyway. I feel like I read up on that years ago when Iw as looking at PSUs, they say not to go with very high wattage PSUs if you aren't going to need it cause of efficiency
[20:26:08] <Activ8> but it's a trade off here if you get a sff there won't be multi nics
[20:26:12] <Activ8> but at least it will be power friendly
[20:26:24] <SantasWiFi> I was looking at the hp t730 thin client
[20:26:24] <Activ8> unless you custom build one maybe?
[20:26:34] <Activ8> you could buy a custom case

[20:28:07] <Activ8> I need a backup plan for my websites, I think once my host comes back up (it's been down just this once in 3 years).

[20:28:35] <SantasWiFi> sounds neat!
[20:29:03] <Activ8> my home connection is fast enough to handle about 50-100 concurrent connections so I might try a failover scenario

[23:27:46] <SantasWiFi> SantaGibby: I'm thinking of maybe focusing more on cloud infosec
[23:27:50] *** Joins: SpeakerToMeat (~Speaker@user/speakertomeat)
[23:27:53] <SantaGibby> nice
[23:28:01] <Cl0udSanta> serious question
[23:28:04] <SantasWiFi> seems like it might be more technical but maybe im wrong
[23:28:09] <SantasWiFi> like less reports and more fixing up shit
[23:28:14] <Cl0udSanta> why is there a song called 'the 12 days of christmas' when theres only 1 fucking day?
[23:28:17] <SantaGibby> security is pretty technical regardless 
[23:28:23] <SantasWiFi> ahh okay
[23:28:25] <SantaGibby> just in differing ways
[23:28:49] <SantaWasTaken> Cl0udSanta: because the Christians wanted their holiday to be better than Hanukkah
[23:28:56] <SantaWasTaken> 12 days > 8 days
[23:28:57] <SantasWiFi> AMEN
[23:28:59] <SantasWiFi> ;P
[23:29:02] <Cl0udSanta> SantasWiFi, it depends on which side of the infosec team you're on, or how big your team is
[23:29:15] <SantasWiFi> which side?
[23:29:16] <SantaGibby> like, when a control says "Separate the duties of individuals to reduce the risk of malevolent activity without collusion." what systems are in place in order to prevent that?
[23:29:25] <SantasWiFi> like client vs firm?
[23:29:25] <SantaGibby> how did you configure those systems? 
[23:29:43] <SantasWiFi> oh gotcha
[23:29:47] <SantasWiFi> yeah that's my shit right there
[23:29:50] <Cl0udSanta> SantasWiFi, or even a firm with a small team
[23:30:24] <SantaGibby> different security teams are setup different as well. Some rarely do technical things and generate reports, and some actually go in and do things like patching 
[23:30:25] <SantasWiFi> but like.. have to write a post-mortem makes me sad 
[23:30:30] <Cl0udSanta> if your team is large, you may end up on the fixing or reporting side, but a small team you'll end up doing both
[23:30:49] <SantasWiFi> SantaGibby: yess I think I'd rather be "boots on the ground" type of infosec guy
[23:30:52] <SantaGibby> reporting is like 25% or more of security, it *has* to be
[23:30:54] <Cl0udSanta> SantaGibby, that too
[23:30:55] <SantasWiFi> but... that kinda sounds like sysadmin work lol
[23:31:15] <SantasWiFi> maybe i only loathe reporting bceause I'm not good a tit
[23:31:18] <SantasWiFi> at it*
[23:31:22] <SantasWiFi> am I projecting rn
[23:31:24] <SantaGibby> basically, you're doing something for a reason, the report is the proof showing why
[23:31:30] <SantaGibby> meh, its not that bad
[23:31:44] <SantasWiFi> I'm trying to write some infosec SOPs and its just not fun haha
[23:31:47] <SantaGibby> once you do it enough its second nature 
[23:31:51] <SantasWiFi> but I honestly have no clue what I'm doing
[23:32:03] <SantaGibby> oh yeah, writing SOPs and Policies is another beast entirely 
[23:32:10] <Cl0udSanta> I hated doin that shit
[23:32:13] <SantaGibby> I fucking loath that shit too
[23:32:15] <iphone> security through obscurity ftw
[23:32:19] <SantaGibby> no
[23:32:21] <SantasWiFi> okay so maybe i'm getting the wrong idea lol
[23:32:23] * SantaGibby smacks iphone 
[23:32:26] <SantasWiFi> LOL
[23:32:26] <Cl0udSanta> I had to do a bunch of them when we did our PCI compliance
[23:32:53] <Cl0udSanta> and... theres that other one.. what the fuck is it... its not PCI...
[23:33:00] <SantaGibby> DSS?
[23:33:05] <Cl0udSanta> no thats part of PCI
[23:33:12] <SantaGibby> WELL IM JUST MAKING SURE OK
[23:33:20] <SantasWiFi> soc?
[23:33:22] <SantaGibby> which industry? 
[23:33:22] <Cl0udSanta> YEA
[23:33:24] <Cl0udSanta> SOC
[23:33:26] <Cl0udSanta> fuccccck
[23:33:34] <SantasWiFi> yeah its a bitch i've heard lol
[23:33:37] <SantaGibby> ooooooh, like a SOC II Type X
[23:33:40] <Cl0udSanta> it absolutely is
[23:33:47] <Cl0udSanta> yea
[23:33:48] <SantaGibby> its only has shit as you make it fyi
[23:34:17] <Cl0udSanta> you go through type 1, and then they audit you randomly, throughout the next year, and if you pass, they put you on type 2, but if you fail you have to start the process again
[23:34:30] <Cl0udSanta> s/type/level/
[23:34:30] <layer8> Cl0udSanta meant: "you go through level 1, and then they audit you randomly, throughout the next year, and if you pass, they put you on level 2, but if you fail you have to start the process again"
[23:34:31] <SantaGibby> thats not the process at all lol
[23:35:01] <Cl0udSanta> thats how it was explained to me by my manager when I was doin up my parts of the shit
[23:35:30] <SantaGibby> Type 1 is a point in time assessment, meaning you show what you do and they ask for artifacts. They don't require proof its been done forever. Type 2 is where they come back after a time (usually 4-5 months) and verify you've been doing it
[23:35:38] <SantaGibby> you do not need a type 1 to get a type 2
[23:35:45] <SantasWiFi> I feel like your standard old "best practices" when it comes to security would get you most of the way there for most sec audits right?
[23:35:46] <SantaGibby> and vise versa 
[23:35:55] <SantasWiFi> Like to me a whole lot of this shit is just common sense
[23:36:05] <SantaGibby> SantasWiFi: usually adopting a framework is the way to go
[23:36:13] <SantaGibby> so like, NIST CSF, for example
[23:36:18] <SantasWiFi> yeee
[23:36:23] <SantasWiFi> but NIST is kinda heavy-handed
[23:36:28] <SantaGibby> well, kinda
[23:36:33] <SantasWiFi> for SMBs and such
[23:36:41] <SantaGibby> you can paint broad strokes, depending 
[23:36:49] <SantaGibby> there are layers of it
[23:37:24] <SantaGibby> you can go full bore, and have a mountain to climb, or you can implement the key pieces over time, while gently adding additional controls as the org grows 
[23:37:41] <SantasWiFi> ahh I see
[23:37:43] <SantasWiFi> yeah makes sense
[23:37:48] <SantaGibby> ideally you do the latter
[23:37:49] <SantasWiFi> easier to eat an elephant one bite at a time
[23:37:55] <SantaGibby> indeed
[23:38:31] <SantaGibby> then you develop a POAM and identify areas that need to be addressed, get buy-in from key stakeholders, and implement based on an agreed timeline 
[23:39:05] *** Joins: l4yer (~l4yer@139.28.219.37)
[23:39:16] <SantaGibby> then when the auditors come through they wont ding you for a control that hasn't been implemented yet
[23:39:55] <SantasWiFi> Plan of Action and Milestones?
[23:40:01] <SantasWiFi> you infosec guys love acronyms ;D
[23:40:06] <SantaGibby> or you can just edit the POAM every year to accrue more technical debt like most places do
[23:40:08] <SantaGibby> yes
[23:40:21] <SantasWiFi> hmmm
[23:40:32] <SantasWiFi> but if your scope changes you wouldn't have a choice but to update the POAM right?
[23:40:39] <SantaGibby> We identified X, will address with Y, over Z timeframe. 
[23:40:41] <SantasWiFi> i guess this is why scope creep is a bitch on long term projects
[23:40:44] <SantaGibby> you'd need to, yes
[23:41:09] <SantaGibby> POAM's are high level, mostly 
[23:41:22] <SantasWiFi> ahh so they don't get real specific?
[23:41:24] <SantaGibby> sometime they have very specific things in them
[23:41:34] <SantaGibby> right, so lets say you don't have MFA
[23:42:39] <SantasWiFi> k
[23:43:35] <SantaGibby> in the POAM, it'd more/less say "Control $x, use of MFA. $company identified the need to implement MFA during audit. Key stakeholders X Y Z determined this item can be addressed within the 2023 fiscal year in order to meet this requirement. Prior to implementation, research will be done to identify rollout and technologies used"  
[23:43:36] <SantaGibby> BOOM
[23:43:40] <SantaGibby> NO MFA UNTIL 2023
[23:44:28] <SantaGibby> there is a little more meat that goes with it, usually the reasons why its going to be delayed, but thats more/less the POAM
[23:45:41] <SantasWiFi> oh gotcha
[23:45:49] <SantasWiFi> okay thats neat
[23:45:54] <SantaGibby> no you're neat
[23:46:06] <SantasWiFi> :3

[23:46:33] <SantaGibby> BOOM
[23:46:34] <SantaGibby> I WIN
[23:47:04] <SantaGibby> anyway, audits are shit
[23:47:14] <SantaGibby> and probably the worst thing in infosec imho 
[23:47:20] <SantaGibby> some people really love that type of work
