[02:45:14] <rdrg109> [TIP] Use (org-id-new) when naming your Org Mode code blocks. Thus, you refer code blocks by their IDs.
[02:45:27] <rdrg109> I consider that more consistent than naming them with an arbitrary name because the latter is likely to change and when that happens, all the code blocks pointing to that code block will stop working as expected.
