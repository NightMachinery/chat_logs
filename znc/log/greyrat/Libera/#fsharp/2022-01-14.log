[00:33:54] <MatthiasVance> Also, renaming an entry in a DU .. has no effect on the other code
[00:33:57] <MatthiasVance> it just stays the same wtf

[01:12:41] <MatthiasVance> biberu: I'm dumb. Remember that I wrote a 'select' function the other day?
[01:12:57] <MatthiasVance> let select f input = f input
[01:13:00] <MatthiasVance> Super dumb.
[01:13:17] <MatthiasVance> Because you can just do: whatever |> fun x -> x.Something |> continue with other stuff
[01:58:40] <biberu> MatthiasVance: not dumb, sure you can do it like that in simple cases, but lenses compose, and that can be interesting
[01:59:07] <MatthiasVance> Dumb as in .. I didn't even consider it xD
[01:59:51] <biberu> :)
[04:25:38] <MatthiasVance> Getting somewhere:
[04:25:41] <MatthiasVance> Expected: Ok (Object (map [("test", String "2")]))  -> Actual:   Ok (Value (String "2"))
[10:59:26] <MatthiasVance> I am prototyping some code to map properties to a Map<string, InternalModel>, and it works fine when parsing single values and collections but when the next item is another object... you get a tree and I really want it flattened:    
[10:59:29] <MatthiasVance> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/Wq68OLqA/
[10:59:57] <MatthiasVance> So mapping.destination is a string here and of the form "/propertyName"
[11:00:24] <MatthiasVance> I think I might have to match on the result
[11:02:44] <biberu> what if you've already found a property with a name used in a nested object? if it's an array?
[11:08:10] <MatthiasVance> biberu: Oh that's fine, the actual destination of a nested property is /propertyOfFirstObject/propertyOfSecondObject
[11:09:00] <MatthiasVance> So I am chomping up the first part and then checking if there is a property, then traverse it
[11:18:35] <MatthiasVance> The problem with code that's recursive (but one function inbetween) is that I can't test it in isolation anymore =/ but maybe I can just replace it with something that returns a set value :)
