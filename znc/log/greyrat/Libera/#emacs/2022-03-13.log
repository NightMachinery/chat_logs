[00:44:41] <UrsoBranco> hi folks
[00:44:58] <UrsoBranco> anybody using emacs 29.0.50 on ubuntu with org-mode ?
[00:45:31] <grym> ,ask
[00:45:32] <fsbot> Just ask your question. It's the best way to know if anyone can help.
[00:45:50] <wgreenhouse> 29.x is ,,edge,, btw
[00:45:50] <fsbot> edge: [0] usually the bleeding edge -- use the latest revisions in a source repository and enjoy the latest features and suffer all the bugs
[00:45:51] <fsbot> [1] broken? lucky you, you get to keep the pieces
[00:45:51] <fsbot> [2] the guiding philosophy of melpa
[00:45:51] <UrsoBranco> since last update my images are opening outside the buffer
[00:46:06] <UrsoBranco> in the imagemagick window
[00:46:13] <parsnip> bot's back!
[00:46:59] <UrsoBranco> does anyone knows how to get the behaviour of opening images in the buffer back again ?
[00:47:24] <UrsoBranco> wgreenhouse: yup, aware of it.
[00:47:28] <pkal> Org mode isn't developed in Emacs, so this is probably not an org issue.
[00:47:50] <wgreenhouse> last update of emacs, or of org?
[00:48:00] <UrsoBranco> wgreenhouse: last update of emacs
[00:48:23] <UrsoBranco> I'm using 29.0.50 of ubuntu ppa package
[00:48:49] <wgreenhouse> UrsoBranco: it may be helpful to review changes in git since last version you used
[00:48:50] <UrsoBranco> GNU Emacs 29.0.50 (build 1, x86_64-pc-linux-gnu, GTK+ Version 3.24.20, cairo version 1.16.0) of 2022-03-08
[00:49:12] <wgreenhouse> 29.0.50 isn't really a meaningful version number. that just means "a git checkout"
[00:49:34] <parsnip> also, did version of org change as a consequence?
[00:49:37] <UrsoBranco> ok
[00:49:53] <UrsoBranco> parsnip: nope, org version is the same
[00:50:26] <parsnip> what method did you use to verify org version did not change?
[00:50:29] <UrsoBranco> Org mode version 9.4 (9.4-19-gb1de0c-elpa @ /home/leslie/.emacs.d/elpa/org-20201012/)
[00:51:26] <parsnip> i'm naive. how does that indicate that org version did not change?
[00:51:28] <wgreenhouse> UrsoBranco: grab a git checkout of emacs, and compare the commit hash from C-h v emacs-repository-version to the commit hash for the previous version you used
[00:51:30] <UrsoBranco> besides the package in elpa, I have the org-mode compilled locally
[00:51:55] <wgreenhouse> UrsoBranco: an unreleased emacs lacks a changelog, so you'll have to go through git logs/diffs yourself
[00:52:30] <UrsoBranco> wgreenhouse: wgreenhouse: thanks
[00:52:48] <UrsoBranco> I'll try this way
[00:52:56] <parsnip> i would probably consider using git bisect, assuming i'm fairly confident nothing else changed. if you can easily get it back to a state that reflects the previous behavior.

[01:23:35] <pjb> bosonbear: note that make-process doesn't run a shell.
[01:25:00] <bosonbear> $f is the place holder of the file name from scrot. I take it as that scrot will substitute $f with the file name when it runs
[01:25:11] <pjb> ok. Then it's good.
[01:25:42] <pjb> (make-process :command '("scrot" "/tmp/%F_%T_$wx$h.png" "-e" "xclip -selection clipboard -target image/png -i $f")) should work.
[01:25:56] <pjb> You don't need any quoting. Just pass each argument as a lisp string.
[01:26:15] *** Quits: irontom (~user@38.81.106.9) (Remote host closed the connection)
[01:27:22] <pjb> Oh. scrot will probably use a shell to run the xclip command.
[01:27:28] <pjb> So you'll need  to escape the $
[01:27:38] <pjb> (make-process :command '("scrot" "/tmp/%F_%T_$wx$h.png" "-e" "xclip -selection clipboard -target image/png -i \\$f"))
[01:28:33] <pjb> bosonbear: ^
[01:29:48] <bosonbear> It seems that the part after -e needs to be single quoted per the instructino of scrot. Any way to achieve that?

[01:38:37] <pjb> bosonbear: but I guess this is a misinterpretation of naive instructions.

[01:45:45] <wgreenhouse> UrsoBranco: ah, yeah, imagemagick introduces some security issues for untrusted input, but is convenient
[01:45:59] <bosonbear> okay it seems your original proposal (make-process :command (list "scrot" "/tmp/%F_%T_$wx$h.png" "-e" "xclip  -selection clipboard -target image/png -i $f")) was good enough. Thanks
[01:46:33] <bosonbear> Another basic q is that how do I pass a variable into the sentinel?
[01:47:36] <bosonbear> Since sentinel takes two variables (process, event), what's the easiest way to pass another variable to it?
[01:48:23] *** Joins: acdw (~case@user/acdw)
[01:48:55] <pjb> bosonbear: you can do that either using a global variable, or using a closure.  The later is better if you want to run several such processes in parallel.
[01:49:30] <bosonbear> Right. So what I want to achieve is to wait until the end of make-process, then do something: https://pastebin.com/raw/RDwr5aNR
[01:49:40] <UrsoBranco> wgreenhouse: do you know if there is any workaround or library that provides the same funcionality that imagemagick that could be used without this security issues ?

[01:58:10] <bosonbear> pjb: if I choose to pull out the lambda part after the sentinel, and define it using defun, is there anyway to achieve it (i.e. making fig accessible by the sentinel function?)
[01:58:23] <wasamasa> lexical binding
[01:58:49] <wasamasa> you will need a lambda in any case

[05:18:12] <mfiano> With real syntactic macros do you really need design patterns? They seem like an invention for the shortcomings of traditional OOP implementations and stringent syntax.
[05:18:28] <mfiano> I come from CL/CLOS OOP so I may be a bit biased.
[05:21:06] <bpalmer> CLOS uses metaobject protocols which are ... design patterns.
[05:22:17] <parsnip> i'm currently applying the, "add unit tests" design pattern
[05:22:50] <parsnip> or the, "pure-ish functions are easier to test" design pattern
[05:22:51] <mfiano> There is a single meta-object protocol, which is a means to extend the language object system as a complement to macros extend the syntax. I can't make sense out of your statement. That's like saying a macro is a design pattern. There's nothing concrete about it.
[05:24:36] <parsnip> maybe they have some generalization, like, "for x in xs do f(x) is a design pattern".

[05:25:33] <mfiano> A design pattern is spoonfeed material for brainless programmers passed on by master programmers, as if there is a specific solution to every problem. Paraphrasing what I remember from the above article, but that is how I view them too.

[05:25:49] <parsnip> > Perfect, and no smiley needed! I was hoping someone would get that dynamic programming is very pattern-like. Thanks for your perceptiveness Andrew! (And note, nowhere did I suggest it was an algorithm.) Indeed, and similarly you could make the case that “divide and conquer” is a programming pattern. But notice the distinction: we don’t say “dynamic programming pattern” or “divide and conquer pattern” (nor, as I pointed out, do
[05:25:49] <parsnip> we say “handkerchief pattern”).
[05:26:31] <parsnip> > The presence of the “pattern” term (the “‘pattern’ pattern” if you will) is the indicator of what’s the problem here. Standard terminology appears naturally, as witnessed by terms like “divide and conquer”, “dynamic programming”, “callback”, etc.
[05:26:38] <parsnip> > What the Book from Hell did was to force standard terminology down everyone’s throat, instead of letting natural selection have its course.

[05:27:29] <mfiano> Oh the comments are very trollish. I had fun reading them years ago
[05:27:46] <bpalmer> whatever parsnip is quoting seems a far better criticism.
[05:28:08] <parsnip> i think the ideal is for people to process the design patterns, understand the motivations in specific scenarios, then be able to synthesize as much as the author did

[05:35:06] <parsnip> right now, my current design pattern is, "refactor code till i can sprinkle clean widget tests"
[05:35:39] <parsnip> that seems objectively good, even if it takes me on a detour in where state goes in my app
[05:35:59] <parsnip> like, i don't know if all state should be at root, or at nearest common ancestor, etc
[05:36:15] <parsnip> i'm not going to obsess about that at this particular moment
[05:36:30] <bpalmer> I think BLoC (which, honestly, I don't fully get) shows signs of being a design pattern that benefits from being taught as an actual design pattern, because I came up naturally with something very like it but without using 'stream' concepts
[05:36:57] <parsnip> right, it sounds very natural
[05:37:19] <bpalmer> so either I had a one-one looking up of state (so there was a hardcoded widget hierarchy) or I had a bunch of closures that came down and mirrored state locally.
[05:37:25] <mfiano> That link was very cringeworthy. Who in their right mind would bypass a protocol and use slot-value?

[05:37:41] <parsnip> but i would have to sort of, rewrite all my "pure dart" in streams, with tests of those streams, etc. I'm not against that, that may be a good thing, but that will be friction due to my inexperience with streams
[05:38:10] <bpalmer> that's where it comes down to my approach.
[05:38:15] <parsnip> so... that's why i said i may decide to add BLoC later, after my "widgets" are cleaned up a bit
[05:38:31] <bpalmer> Another thing that helped me appreciate 'patterns' as a separately taught concept is just working through the Book of Semaphores
[05:38:55] <parsnip> right now logic/UI/layout are somewhat mixed up, and i think i can improve that without leaping into BLoC immediately
[05:38:56] <bpalmer> Concurrency is something that patterns work really well for, because people are *terrible* at thinking concurrently.
[05:39:34] <parsnip> BLoC doesn't necessarily dictate if state will be closer to root or nearest common ancestor, iiuc
[05:39:58] <parsnip> i thin the encourage nearest common ancestor, as opposed to redux which apparently encoruages monolithic state
[05:40:02] <bpalmer> parsnip: right, it's completely agnostic. You have a stream that your widget is paying attention to, and a dispose() that will close the stream connection
[05:40:29] <parsnip> yeah, it's about sort of pulling the asynchronity of logic out of the UI, into pure dart
[05:40:59] <parsnip> probably much easier to test, once you get comfortable with stream code

[07:52:41] <roadie> twitter is really good at censoring. I tweeted a screenshot of a tweet that was deleted by twitter when that mariupol hospital bombing got traction and the screenshot was immediately taken off too. offtopic of course but I had to laugh.
[07:54:23] <parsnip> twitter sucks
[07:54:42] <roadie> I think they are on the ball :)
[07:54:54] <parsnip> i tried to use it as just to bookmark some webpages, and they repeatedly disabled my account as spam, i kept having to go through the process of reenabling account
[07:55:23] <parsnip> bookmarks weren't controversial
[07:55:34] <parsnip> i think i was saving links discussing helmet laws, etc
[07:55:43] <MysteriousSilve4> speaking of censorship, would it be possible for tor exit nodes to block websites?
[07:55:56] <roadie> but the bookmarks were links so ...
[07:56:10] <parsnip> twitter don't like links?
[07:56:16] <MysteriousSilve4> heard people were excluding EU and US exit nodes in their torrc
[07:56:24] <parsnip> i mean, as i went through process of reenabling, noone complained
[07:56:27] <parsnip> but their bot...
[07:56:35] <roadie> I mean if that was your main use - no texts inbetween - I don't know
[07:56:50] <parsnip> i think it was setup against me because i wasn't disclosing personal information about myself
[07:57:03] <roadie> you don't have to do you?
[07:57:12] <parsnip> i don't want to do me
[07:58:50] <parsnip> doesn't disclosing personal information, like personality, opinions, etc, help them apply machine learning and generate ad revenue?
[07:59:11] <parsnip> presumably they can still do that if i'm posting links about traffic rules
[07:59:16] <roadie> I have a job as a name, no bio no location and I mistyped my birthday but so far nobody cares because nobody sees me
[08:00:45] <parsnip> are you still using aquamacs?
[08:00:48] <roadie> oh, here is the censored image they are so scared of showing: https://imgur.com/a/JWsTPOb

[08:01:24] <parsnip> it's loading still
[08:01:38] <parsnip> oh, imgur might be down here

[09:25:34] <codingquark> Cannot actually enjoy shit, it's all shit
[09:25:42] <corwin> I've been fighting off a cold for what feels like several weeks.  One day last week I slept from after work around 7p until time for work 8a the next day.
[09:25:46] <codingquark> But a sliver of joy of the sound of birds
[09:26:04] <corwin> ouch.  relatable, but still ouch.
[09:26:12] <codingquark> 13h of sleep is cool!
[09:26:35] <corwin> I was shocked to wake up and find out how long I'd been out.  I think I hardly rolled over.
[09:26:44] <codingquark> :O
[09:26:50] <codingquark> That's crazy
[09:27:15] <codingquark> Sounds like how one gets "knocked out" after drinking and taking pills
[09:27:22] <corwin> We got a heated blanket and it's so damned nice.  I think that's part of it.
[09:27:46] <corwin> Yeah, like that except with fever and chest congestion in place of drinks and chasers.
[09:29:24] <codingquark> I want a cooled mattress
[09:30:12] <codingquark> I live in 40C 80% of the time and then 10C for the rest
[09:30:26] <corwin> I had a waterbed for a while, which could be used as such by setting the water temperature.  I think that's the only part of it I miss.
[09:30:36] <codingquark> corwin: that's sad, I hope you recover
[09:31:14] <corwin> matter of time, no doubt.  Almost enough of the snow is melted that I can ride thee OneWheel to work again.  Looking forward to that.
[09:31:51] <corwin> Did you ever get your own bike codingquark or still borrowing one?
[09:32:20] <codingquark> corwin: I got one only last week! Schwinn Searcher 4
[09:32:29] <codingquark> Did 25km on it yesterday
[09:32:54] <corwin> very nice!  I love a Schwinn.
[09:33:22] <codingquark> You should wear those 80s style punk clothes, wear ridiculously large gadgets and go on the onewheel
[09:33:35] <corwin> hmm.  good call, tbh
[09:34:04] <corwin> it's very tempting to ride around with the sword and shield
[09:34:07] <codingquark> 2ft large audio system in one hand that blasts low fidelity music
[09:34:26] <codingquark> ha ha, that would look amazing - sword and shield
[09:34:47] <codingquark> Though you may look like a protestor of dubious side in current times

[14:26:40] <bosonbear> hey folks I'm stuck at another issue that is related to the variable scope/binding: when I use make-process and give :filter a lambda function to process the output, what's the best way to "save" that output into a variable that can still be accessed after the make-process call?
[14:26:56] <bosonbear> The example I have in mind is this: https://pastebin.com/raw/WKfUiqVA
[14:27:57] <bosonbear> Right after get "chunk", I can princ it okay. Yet, after make-process is over, princ filename gives me nil.

[14:29:57] <bosonbear> haha made my day
[14:30:02] <wasamasa> make-process returns before the process filter and sentinels are run
[14:30:20] <wasamasa> so if you want to run code after the process filter, it needs to be in the sentinel
[14:30:43] <wasamasa> async programming is all about callback functions, so the solution is typically to have more callback functions

[14:30:58] <bosonbear> Oh darn it. I thought it's due to variable scope. That makes more sense. Thanks
[14:31:12] <wasamasa> the process filter callback is run every time there's process output and the sentinel callback after every change in process status
[14:31:51] <wasamasa> so you'd adjust the sentinel callback to check whether the process has exit and only then access whatever the process filter callback has set

[14:43:46] <wasamasa> if you have a let around both filter and sentinel callback
[14:43:50] <wasamasa> then they share that environment
[14:43:55] <wasamasa> let over lambda == closure
[14:44:04] <wasamasa> requires lexical binding to work correctly

[15:20:51] <Nselm> Hi. When trying to define a own source for helm I have the following problem: How do I deal with the user wanting something non-predefined? I.e. creating a new file etc. As far as I can see, the action doesnt get anything to use in this case, which means that the user cant create own files, for example, only select among precreated ones. Now my
[15:20:51] <Nselm> idea was that I could dynamically add a file with the name of what the user is currently typing, but I cant find a method to get that from helm, e.g. minibuffer-contents does not seem to work for a helm source. Any ideas?

It's my first elisp attemp and thanks a lot for the hands on help (pjb bpalmer wasamasa and many more)

[18:55:00] <aephos> I didn't find any obvious configuration in either and shr looks extensible enough, but I also didn't see any obvious way to change a stylesheet or something without having to rewrite the rendering code.

[18:58:40] <wasamasa> did you also look at the code?
[18:59:11] <wasamasa> nov does override a number of shr rendering functions

[19:05:21] <aephos> From the documentation string it looks like it just does the inner form and then restores the point and buffer. Seems like it ensures we don't edit the contents of the buffer. If I'm going to be deleting blank lines, that might not work for me.
