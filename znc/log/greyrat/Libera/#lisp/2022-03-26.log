[16:17:56] <mdhughes> The native app on the Mac is one of the most infuriating programs I've ever used, it's like they hired a hostile team to make a non-Mac-like app where it's impossible to watch the next video.
[16:20:06] <mdhughes> Normally Mac native audio/video low-level APIs are amazing, as close to zero latency as possible and you can do anything to the image, often on GPU instead of burning CPU. It's ideal for processing video. But you need to know the platform and care about app design.

[16:21:23] <mdhughes> And on-topic, I have tried hooking up to the APIs from Scheme, but it tends to be heavy on massively nested structures, so it's better to write C/Obj-C for that and have a very lightweight command bridge from Scheme.

[16:52:08] <amazigh> I looked more closely at cl-who at https://edicl.github.io/cl-who/#example
[16:53:46] <amazigh> it is a template language embedded in CL; but unlike the approach I was using so far, it requires that the macro `with-html-output` somehow 'eval' some constructs
[16:55:21] *** Joins: inky (~inky@5.77.183.200)
[16:55:25] <amazigh> the macro will produce CL code that calls string procedure to output the desired serialization (xhtml, sgml or html5) 
[16:56:10] <amazigh> spoiler: I do not understand the advantage compared to the approach I use that I will describe in a follow up message
[16:57:03] <amazigh> the gist of the approach I rely on, is to take as input a tree of symbols, strings, and translate that to html5
[16:57:04] *** Quits: inky_ (~inky@46.36.114.138) (Ping timeout: 272 seconds)
[16:58:32] <amazigh> so the process to render html is two step: 1) construct a quasiquoted s-expr, and use regular scheme procedure such as `map` for building a list of items

[16:59:36] <amazigh> An example todo list can be (lambda (todos) `(ul ,@(map (lambda (todo) `(li ,todo)) todos)) where todos are a list of strings
[17:00:01] <amazigh> what is the advantage of CL-WHO approach (I read some of its documentation)
[17:00:14] <amazigh> and what is the disadvantage of my approach?
[17:01:42] <mdhughes> cl-who looks like the Arc or h4xx0rnews approach.
[17:02:28] <mdhughes> There's no real difference between doing it as macros or HOF. Probably don't want to build it as strings, tho, that's a lot of wasted memory.
[17:04:53] <amazigh> (on a somewhat related note both clojure and cl seems to use big macros more often that the scheme code I know about)
[17:05:04] <mdhughes> But really I don't think generating HTML's a great idea, either. Templating languages like mustache are much more HTML-y, and then you build your backend in a language that knows nothing of HTML.
[17:06:10] <mdhughes> I've had a lot of success with that approach in Java and Node, and if I ever get around to rewriting my server in Scheme, I'll do it there, too.
[17:07:02] <edgar-rft> when I'm writing HTML I usually write it in HTML
[17:07:22] <amazigh> the problem with mustache and the likes, is that you need to write a debugger yourself, the advantage of mustache is that you can have an external file that the user can easily make her own.
[17:07:33] <mdhughes> My Node server has app/ full of JS server code, web/ full of literal HTML, JS, etc for the client side, and template/ with mustache files.
[17:09:15] <mdhughes> Complex templating systems really suck to debug, but the beauty of mustache is it's so simple. There's like 3 states to have to test (item, collection, iterate over collection), and you know it works.
[17:10:51] <mdhughes> There's even a CL-mustache: https://github.com/kanru/cl-mustache/

[23:37:56] <puchacz> hi, I thought ultralisp was a drop-in replacement for quicklisp; I evaluated (ql-dist:install-dist "http://dist.ultralisp.org/" :prompt nil) and nothing happened

[23:38:24] <puchacz> i.e. quicklisp downloaded a dist, but then what :) ?
[23:38:39] <drakonis> its a mirror, basically?
[23:40:11] <puchacz> I am lost a little, if I wanted to see what is in quicklisp, I could eval (ql:system-apropos "regex") for example; is ultralisp just quicklisp but using a different package repository?
[23:40:45] <puchacz> if I eval now (ql:quickload ...), will I get a package from ultralisp?
[23:41:42] <drakonis> yes
[23:41:45] <drakonis> if it is available there.
[23:42:00] <drakonis> it is given higher priority over quicklisp
[23:43:37] <puchacz> how do I switch between quicklisp and ultralisp repo?
[23:44:12] <drakonis> idk
[23:44:31] <drakonis> ultralisp does have everything you'd find in quicklisp
[23:45:50] <puchacz> so now, if I want to replace all my quicklisp projects with the newest builds from ultralisp, what do I do?
[23:46:10] <puchacz> and can I get back to quicklisp?
[23:46:16] <drakonis> update-all-dists?
[23:47:15] <puchacz> ok, tks
[23:47:40] <drakonis> not sure why it'd be necessary to go back
[23:47:50] <puchacz> I will try - should have backed all up before evaulating (install-dist ultralisp)....

[23:48:43] <drakonis> i don't really see any value on not using ultralisp these days
[23:48:54] <drakonis> quicklisp's fairly slow
[23:48:54] <puchacz> no worries, thanks :)
[23:49:33] <puchacz> quicklisp -> ultralisp -> tacholisp.....
