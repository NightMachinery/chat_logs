[00:10:47] <Wafficus> weirdly enough, if I chopped it up a bit, its getting there:
[00:10:48] <Wafficus> https://www.musimatic.xyz/artgallery.html
[00:11:04] <Wafficus> I just can't get the images to stack 3 in a row yet
[00:11:21] <Wafficus> more so because I went back to basics cause my ideas of using containers was pretty bad earlier
[00:13:47] <Wafficus> just want the width to be 400px, and height to be 284px for each image, so that there are 3 images per row
[00:13:57] <Wafficus> rather *4 images per row

[08:21:02] <FunkyBob> haven't delved into MUIs datagrid, Rockwood
[08:21:08] <FunkyBob> as for what you should use, that depends on what you need
[08:21:19] <FunkyBob> you've given absolutely zero detail
[08:21:26] <michigan> guise... when shud one use swiping and when shud one use scrolling for mobile web appz?
[08:22:05] <Rockwood> i wanna use table for show topper
[08:23:22] <Rockwood> toppers like (score base) in win car racing and in attack won and in top busters
[08:23:27] <Rockwood> something like this
[08:23:39] <Rockwood> i think table makes its easy
[08:24:29] <Rockwood> instead change every time div or ul
[08:24:42] <FunkyBob> umm
[08:24:47] <FunkyBob> nope, still don't understand
[08:25:00] <Rockwood> i wanna show lists
[08:25:18] <Rockwood> and on type selection i wanna change list
[08:26:02] <FunkyBob> when you say "on type selection"
[08:26:08] <FunkyBob> do you mean the user types something in?
[08:26:12] <FunkyBob> or the user selects a type?
[08:26:14] <FunkyBob> or something else?
[08:26:17] <Rockwood> like i wanna see car (details in list) or bus (details in list)
[08:26:22] <Rockwood> like models
[08:26:47] <Rockwood> yes you can say admin group list or other staff group list
[08:27:31] <Rockwood> when i clicked on admin tab then only admin list should be display
[08:27:38] <Rockwood> its just a example
[08:28:17] <Rockwood> then i clicked on other staff members it should be display the other staffs details
[08:28:39] <Rockwood> data will come from DB
[08:28:50] <Rockwood> in json response by fetch
[08:30:07] <Rockwood> as per category clicked items list should be show in other words
[08:30:40] <Rockwood> i think table also useful in other things
[08:30:56] <Rockwood> like event list show
[08:39:05] <Rockwood> on event i will handle data change by fetch

[23:07:41] <jwpapi> what does the purple area mean? https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/R7OGUH9V/image.png
[23:30:17] <michigan> jwpapi: thats a horrible horrible design :(
[23:30:40] <michigan> sorry did i say that out loud, my bad
[23:33:21] <jwpapi> michigan: that’s not anwering my question
[23:33:48] <jwpapi> I obviously want to change it, otherwise I wouldn’t ask what that means
[23:36:35] <michigan> jwpapi: i guess it means that you're currently hovering over a parent selector that includes all the child selectors within that purple field
[23:37:07] <jwpapi> there 3 child elements and the last one is not an element
[23:37:50] <michigan> idk, i suck sorry
[23:43:49] <entuland> jwpapi, that last part with a diagonal stripe could be padding or free available space in a grid / flex layout, hard to tell from that screenshot
[23:44:03] <entuland> padding or margin or the alike as well
[23:44:12] <entuland> is that page reachable online?
[23:44:23] <jwpapi> it’s not padding or margin
[23:44:30] <jwpapi> it’s definitely free space in a flex
[23:44:39] <entuland> okay
[23:44:40] <jwpapi> entuland: unfortunately not
[23:44:53] <jwpapi> i think the other column creates that gap
[23:45:18] <entuland> the docs for the browser you're using should explain the meaning of those highlights
[23:45:30] <entuland> doesn't look like chrome
[23:45:35] <entuland> maybe firefox or edge?
[23:47:57] <entuland> oh crap it's chrome
[23:50:25] <entuland> I found the docs for the grids, there has to be something for flex as well https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/css/grid/
[23:52:40] <entuland> https://daily-dev-tips.com/posts/chrome-devtools-flex-debugger/
