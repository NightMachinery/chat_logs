[00:01:32] <ggreer> there's a pretty long list of pathogens. I don't know what percentage are airborne (and by airborne I mean droplets or measles-style airborne)
[00:02:04] <kuudes> norovirus is airborne but only when heated
[00:02:30] <kuudes> oh, btw, could that future mrna multivaccine also contain vaccina against norovirus?
[00:02:35] <kuudes> that would be appreciated
[00:02:55] <ggreer> the WHO has a stupid definition that only includes the measles stuff. this is why for the longest time, covid wasn't technically "airborne"
[00:02:59] <rmmh> it's going to be like those knockoff NES carts-- 100-in-1 MRNA VAX!
[00:03:00] <kuudes> I suppose I would pay 100 e for vaccine that protects 1 year against norovirus

[01:07:55] <rmmh> yeah
[01:08:15] <rmmh> I'm just saying as an intervention sprinkling iron in the ocean is almost certainly less disruptive to the ecosystem than a fish farm
[01:08:36] <Ralith> harassing the natives is, of course, easier
[01:08:46] <ggreer> why would you get salmon then? they're usually diseased and fucked up, practically rotting

[01:09:32] <Jayson_Virissimo> How reversible is iron fertilization? Reversibility is more of a concern for me when it comes to large untried interventions.
[01:09:41] <ggreer> rmmh: I thought it was because the salmon are roided out, which reduces their immune systems
[01:09:54] <ggreer> they're set up to swim upstream, spawn, and die
[01:09:55] <rmmh> ggreer: maybe that too? there's a lot more parasitic worms in farmed fish
[01:10:25] <Logos01> ggreer: So the greenpeace.to site seems to be based out of the UK. The certificate is from the UserTRUST CA which is I believe a subsidiary of Comodo which means someone payed for it and validated themselves as owning the domain.

[01:10:44] <Logos01> ggreer: So if that page is a parody it's one that would've gotten flagged pretty quickly I'd imagine.
[01:10:46] <rmmh> Jayson_Virissimo: the reversibility is mostly that the iron will get consumed/dissipate within months, so if you screw it up it will stop quickly
[01:10:59] <ggreer> for most of their lives, salmon look like normal fish. right before they go upstream to spawn, they get hyuge and change color
[01:11:35] <Logos01> Also: as to salmon and parasites: this is why you don't eat same-day-catch salmon sushi.
[01:12:07] <Logos01> Salmon flesh defrosts very well, especially compared to whiteflesh fish.
[01:12:26] <Logos01> (Even in Japan they now require salmon to be frozen and defrosted before serving.)
[01:12:55] <rmmh> uh
[01:13:12] <rmmh> salmon wasn't used for sushi in japan until a huge marketing campaign when norway had like 2 million pounds of excess frozen salmon
[01:13:30] <kuudes> oh, so thats where it has been put to
[01:13:43] <kuudes> fish production is stupid
[01:14:08] <Jayson_Virissimo> My grandfather was a tuna fisherman his whole life and didn't find out until after he retired that people in Japan were eating his catch without cooking it. He was disgusted.
[01:14:11] <rmmh> I feel bad about most seafood consumption because none of it seems sustainable. at least factory farming doesn't seem to collapse a *global* ecosystem
[01:14:25] <kuudes> indeed
[01:14:34] <kuudes> and the point is not even the produce, it is just make-work
[01:14:42] <Logos01> rmmh: Yes. Because raw salmon is so parasitic and so everyone "knew" that salmon was filthy/disgusting.
[01:14:51] <kuudes> ie people want to be fishermen, therefore we must subsidise them and get them to fish

[01:15:54] <kuudes> rmmh, most of fishing at least in developed countries is such
[01:16:00] <rmmh> america has this whole mythical fetish for small farmers despite them baaasically not existing any more, squeezed out by economies of scale
[01:16:01] <kuudes> norway especially
[01:16:11] <Logos01> rmmh: I'm making the point that even in Japan where raw same-day catch sushi is a common meal, the gov't *requires* salmon to have been frozen before being served.
[01:16:36] <kuudes> there is no demand for that amount of fish, so norway subsidizes it and eu bans import or puts punitive tariffs for it because of the subsidies
[01:16:37] <rmmh> Logos01: yeah, in particular the issue is that freshwater fish tend to have parasites that can infect mammals, while saltwater fish don't
[01:16:55] <rmmh> Logos01: salmon have been eaten by bears et al for millions of years, plenty of time for fun worms to learn how to ride that cycle
[01:17:02] <kuudes> isn't salmon salt water fish?

[01:17:24] <rmmh> kuudes: anadromous-- they adapt to freshwater to swim upstream and spawn
[01:17:30] <Logos01> kuudes: salmon spawn in freshwater but live the rest of their life in saltwater.
[01:17:33] <kuudes> hmm, yeah, ok
[01:17:45] <kuudes> I was unsure how the taxonomy in that went
[01:18:06] <Logos01> Yeah I wasn't aware of "andromous" as a term either.
[01:18:34] <Logos01> But anyhoo.  Yes, overfishing of seas is an issue and induced phytoplankton blooms actually seems to be a countermeasure to overfishing.
[01:18:45] <Logos01> Since it increases the foodstock available so more survive.
[01:18:58] <rmmh> I guess euryhaline is the more generic one, anadromous is specifically going from the sea to rivers to spawn
[01:19:39] <Logos01> rmmh: Look, we all know the part where we need to worry is when sharks become amphibious and learn to fly or use tools.
[01:19:48] <Logos01> The rest is gravy.

[01:20:43] <rmmh> crocodiles are landsharks, change my view
[01:24:43] <Jayson_Virissimo> Sounds like iron fertilization would unkill two birds with one stone.

[03:22:16] <quanticle> Prediction, before I click: they're against
[03:22:26] <quanticle> They were against in-vitro fertilization too, from what I remember
[03:22:50] <Logos01> Conditionally. The stance indicates, when you understand their wording choices) that natural pregnancies must not be transferred to exowombs.
[03:23:05] <quanticle> "The technology currently being proposed appears to be entirely moral, if used for moral means. The device in question is essentially an improved effort at creating an environment in which premature infants can continue to grow and develop safely.

[03:32:26] <Logos01> Just saying.
[03:32:35] <kuudes> so it is just a constant amount tax with fadeout for incomes near 0
[03:32:36] <quanticle> TIL apparently Japan has a TV licesne fee too.
[03:33:13] <Logos01> (And yes it's my computer display. MediaPC/laptop)
[03:33:14] <kuudes> the tax receiver is the public broadcasting company directly
[03:33:58] <saturn2> why only tv, why doesn't every government service have its own separate tax
[03:34:11] <Betawolf> path dependency
[03:34:21] <kuudes> the point is that the public broadcasting company needs to be independent of the government because of freedom of the press
[03:34:47] <kuudes> so that the politicians sort of can't cut the funding if the public tv broadcasts scoops about the government
[03:36:29] <kuudes> finland dropped one year from #1 most free press to #2 because prime minister voiced they were displeased with the public broadcasting company trying to harass them
[03:36:51] <quanticle> I guess that's just proof that those free press rankings are kind of a joke
[03:37:10] <kuudes> oh?
[03:37:20] <quanticle> Like, once you get past out and out repression, does it really make that much of a difference that the PM wags their finger disapprovingly at some media outlent?
[03:37:23] <quanticle> *outlet
[03:38:33] <kuudes> well it is sort of similar thing as minister of justice making political remark on how they would prefer some past case to have been judged
[03:38:50] <saturn2> if the PM complains but can't do anything, doesn't that indicate more press freedom rather than less?
[03:38:52] <quanticle> Which is... fine?
[03:38:57] <kuudes> its not
[03:39:12] <kuudes> the minister of justice may hold indirect budgetary power over courts etc
[03:39:16] <quanticle> It absolutely is! What's the point of electing politicians if they hold no beliefs? 
[03:39:30] <kuudes> it is not enough the officials are independent of the politicians, it must also not be under doubt
[03:40:03] <quanticle> Then why have elections at all? Just have the bureaucrats and technocrats run everything.
[03:40:05] <quanticle> Like Singapore
[03:40:06] <kuudes> no

[03:41:54] <Betawolf> no, wait, I see, they weren't _agreeing_ with the officials, so they were acting in the wrong.
[03:42:05] <quanticle> Yeah, that's what I don't understand. You're allowed to have beliefs about how officials ought to decide things in the future, but not have beliefs about whether past decisions were correctly made? So upon what basis do you have of determining whether future decisions are correct? How do you communicate those beliefs to the public?
[03:42:11] <saturn2> they turned politics into a game show and now game show hosts are being elected... how could this be happening to me?
[03:42:39] <kuudes> you talk about the future and about general ethics, not about single past cases
[03:42:53] <kuudes> when the politicians update the law, future sentences change
[03:42:58] <kuudes> but courts are independent
[03:43:16] <kuudes> and they should not be guessing what current politicians want them to do, only do as law tells them to do
[03:43:29] <quanticle> kuudes: Ah yes, the Communist solution; we can talk about general critiques, but pointing out specific instances in which the state was mistaken are definitely out. Forgive me if I disagree with that approach.
[03:43:59] <kuudes> other people but the minister of justice are more free to talk about that stuff
[03:44:19] <kuudes> but minister of justice truly and unavoidably holds technical power in that domain, and must not abuse that
[03:44:56] <quanticle> Like, let's put it this way: in 1896, the US Supreme Court upheld segregation, with Plessy v. Ferguson. Would it have been wrong for a politician to state that they believed that "separate but equal" doctrine promulgated by that decision was incorrect, and that the case should have been decided differently?
[03:45:38] <kuudes> likely not given the politician does not hold power over the supreme court. or does that politician hold such power?
[03:46:01] <quanticle> They do! Where do you think Supreme Court judges come from? Divine appointment?
[03:46:20] <kuudes> they can't fire them
[03:46:28] <quanticle> Is it wrong for a politician to state, "I believe this was incorrectly decided and therefore I will endeavor to appoint a judge who agrees with me?"
[03:46:45] <kuudes> over here politicians don't appoint judges but technically
[03:46:52] *** Joins: GvP (~GvP@ip70-162-85-176.ph.ph.cox.net)
[03:46:56] <kuudes> the courts propose the judges and politicians then appoint those
[03:47:32] <kuudes> the politicians have the power to not to appoint some proposed person but they can't invent their own to that
[03:47:48] <quanticle> Do your courts have the power of judicial review? Can they decide that a law violates whatever basic law serves as your constitution, and therefore nullify it?
[03:47:52] <kuudes> no
[03:47:58] <quanticle> Okay, see, that's the big difference
[03:48:01] <quanticle> Ours do
[03:48:13] <kuudes> the politicians write the laws, the courts judge on them
[03:49:12] <kuudes> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_powers#Montesquieu's_separation_of_powers_system
[03:49:13] <Robomot> Separation of powers - Wikipedia (Separation of powers refers to the division of a state's government into branches, each with separate, independent powers and responsibilities, so that the powers of one branch are not in conflict with those of the other branches. The typical division is into three branches: a legislature, an executive, and a judiciary, which is the trias politica model. …)
[03:49:30] <quanticle> Okay, then that makes a bit more sense; the politicians can always pass another law if they don't like what the courts have decided. It's not like the US Supreme Court, where, in some cases, you'd have to amend the Constitution to overturn a court decision via the legislature.
[03:49:48] <kuudes> nordic model in general is so that there are civil officials who are independet in their domain, but that initiative power and decision power are separate
[03:50:13] <kuudes> ie ministers can't initiate their decisions, they can only approve or not the proposition

[03:52:59] <kuudes> well if he was online and cheerious in t-4 h he was not badly hit, I'd presume?
[03:54:21] <kuudes> in usa, isn't the power of impeachment supposed to do sort of similar? ie those positions that are covered by impeachment process can't be fired by anything but that?
[03:54:51] <kuudes> ie supreme court judges, after appointment, are immune from anything but impeachment, same for president, and some other officers?
[03:54:55] <feep> quanticle: yeah, south is pretty floodsafe
[03:55:01] <kuudes> nice
[03:55:07] <feep> no river valleys without valleys lol
[03:55:18] <quanticle> Haha, nice
[03:55:18] <feep> my entire like 100km surroundings are a flat plain
[03:55:25] <quanticle> Wait
[03:55:32] <quanticle> Isn't that like the opposite of flood safe?
[03:55:49] <feep> low-key flooding yes, but we don't get the sort of giant deluges
[03:56:14] <quanticle> Ah, okay. So the kind of flooding that leaves you temporarily homeless but not the kind that kills you
[03:56:28] <feep> more the kind that fills up your cellar if you live next to a canal
[03:56:41] <feep> not the kind that tears down buildings, generally
[03:56:50] <quanticle> Yeah. I'm familiar. There are many places here that flood like that
[03:56:58] <feep> srsly, look at munich on a german topo map
[03:56:59] <feep> we are ~flat~
[03:57:24] <kuudes> was it so that the main rivers around there have widish (tens of kilometers) valley around them but then there are hundreds of km flatland which does not have such rivers, or?
[03:57:26] <quanticle> Well, flat is justice
[03:57:53] <kuudes> and the flatland which is not in valley is considerably higher (100s meters) than the valley?
[03:58:09] <feep> kuudes: I think so, maybe? the point is we don't even have *any* valleys. this is all swampland.
[03:58:16] <kuudes> indeed
[03:58:29] <kuudes> but the problem at hand is that such a valley area is now under water, elsewhere
[03:58:56] <feep> hm, none of the ones I've seen on the news at least have been like that
[03:59:02] <kuudes> hmm
[03:59:22] <feep> also you can see the alps on a good day :D
[03:59:25] <feep> which is nice

[04:00:45] <feep> anyway, even if there's flooding here, I've checked and I don't live in the danger zone
[04:00:49] <Gurkenglas> surely releasing alphafold isnt good for our chances
[04:01:07] <feep> meh, not like an AI would need it
[04:01:16] <feep> could maybe do bad things for bioterror ... maybe??

[04:01:30] <Gurkenglas> thing is with enough research we dont need an ai to protein the planet
[04:01:56] <Gurkenglas> if gpt is the pivot, theres a chance we can just ask it to generate ai safety papers and dodge death
[04:02:28] <Gurkenglas> if biotech is the pivot, what's the win scenario here? i don't see a good one
[04:02:35] <quanticle> gwern: There's a "melting" joke in there somewhere, I know it
[04:02:55] <Gurkenglas> stopping aging isn't gonna cut it
[04:03:25] <feep> I can only hope they did the math
[04:05:43] <Gurkenglas> understand the brain enough to work around that "power corrupts" circuitry, maybe, and then grow extra brain onto someone?
[04:07:10] <Gurkenglas> superplague that makes everyone careful?
[04:07:38] <Gurkenglas> not in the regular way, just, like superplague infects everyone and goes into their brains and turns up the carefulness dial.
[04:08:03] <Gurkenglas> that might be all we need to survive.
[04:09:03] <kuudes> we still haven't tried countervirus for pandemic
[04:09:32] <Gurkenglas> *releases carefulness plague* "i shouldn't have done that. i should not have done that. i shouldn't have done that."
[04:09:48] <kuudes> "[superplague] turns up the carefulness dial" *monkeys paw* superplague kills off everyone who is not very very careful
[04:17:53] <quanticle> It turns out that the superplague just makes people unable to read warning labels.
[04:21:47] <Gurkenglas> <feep> I can only hope they did the math <- wishful thinking. when they did the api i was hoping they were trying to be Cauldron, checking whether people come up with enough prompt engineering tricks to assemble into a wish exploit. Now I just think they're LARPing.
[04:25:55] <Gurkenglas> of course we'd go into the information era with our culture currently random walked into high openness of research. that's where era changes come from. looks like it's where the next one comes from.
[04:29:49] <Gurkenglas> (at least our culture doesn't seem to have the 3.6 Röntgen glitch. how are the chinese on that lately?)
[04:30:27] <feep> Gurkenglas: I mean, there was no way this was gonna work cause gpt is honestly pretty far away from intelligence

[04:31:01] <|dbotdan> Shawn Presser ⠕ (@theshawwn, 2021-07-15 23:59): ‘I’ve spent a long time thinking about how to phrase this impactfully. I don’t know a way: | My wife pointed out to me that every woman on Twitter with a following is “unnaturally gorgeous.” And she’s right. I can’t unsee it. | It’s unfair. Women shouldn’t have to care about this.👇’
[04:31:01] <Gurkenglas> feep, how do you think you know that? (plus they had less evidence)
[04:31:19] <feep> Gurkenglas: architectural intuition mostly
[04:31:34] <Gurkenglas> *cough* modus tollens
[04:31:42] <feep> shawwwn: with a following *and a profile*
[04:32:18] <gwern> you know, there are such things as discrimination in favor of women and against men
[04:32:34] <quanticle> did shawwwn just call his wife ugly?
[04:32:52] <feep> I think this is less "you need to be pretty" and more "you can get a following *by* being pretty"
[04:32:56] <gwern> quanticle: she doesn't have a following, so you can't reverse the material conditional
[04:33:01] <quanticle> I see
[04:33:33] <gwern> you could certainly interpret it as shawwwn providing bayesian evidence for his wife not being unnaturally gorgeous, though :)
[04:34:01] <quanticle> As a rationalist, that is my duty :)
[04:34:02] <gwern> (see also the wason selection test)
[04:34:10] <Betawolf> I mean, it's obviously the case that getting lots of followers on Twitter makes you hotter.
[04:34:38] <feep> also why aren't more people doing zooms :(
[04:34:40] <quanticle> Betawolf: Well, sure, that makes sense. Influencers get free beauty products
[04:34:45] <feep> all the zooms I've seen of clipgan have been great
[04:34:55] <feep> is it just not reproed yet
[04:35:10] <Betawolf> right. It's a classic first-mover-takes-all situation.
[04:35:24] <shawwwn> I think you all are fortunate that no one cares how ugly you are, the way that everyone would care if you were female
[04:35:35] <gwern> lookism is actually quite strong for men
[04:36:00] <Betawolf> We're just in the intermediate period before Taylor Swift becomes too beautiful for mortals to look upon.
[04:36:20] <shawwwn> To be fair, I mostly posted this here for the inevitable gwern “well ackshually” contrarian “evidence”. 🍿
[04:36:27] <Gurkenglas> feep, feels like doing good math takes good pattern recognition plus verifying the formal stuff. and attention seems like it does the pattern recognition part pretty good. do you think one needs any other magic for a pivot?
[04:36:27] <feep> RiversHaveWings: sidenote holy shit your twitter feed is fucking amazing
[04:36:52] <feep> Gurkenglas: no it's great at the instinctive parts, I just think anything seriously scary needs reflection and sustained awareness
[04:37:07] <shawwwn> RiversHaveWings: these are stunning https://twitter.com/rivershavewings/status/1415821762374160385?s=21

[04:37:19] <feep> shawwwn: yeah we're all fortunate, us nerds, that nobody makes fun of us for being ugly
[04:37:53] <shawwwn> They don’t. You get hired, promoted, and can say basically whatever you want while feeling like you’re listened to.
[04:38:03] <feep> hang on, you're pivoting here.
[04:38:19] <shawwwn> Swap bodies with an ugly woman, and you wouldn’t be so quick to equivocate, I think.
[04:38:33] <quanticle> "What if clients didn’t need to know they were even displaying a listing? What if we could pass the UI directly to the client and skip the idea of listing data entirely? That’s essentially what SDUI does — we pass both the UI and the data together, and the client displays it agnostic of the data it contains."

Before we dive into Airbnb’s implementation of server-driven UI (SDUI), it’s…)
[04:38:37] <quanticle> Hmmm... yes, if only there were some kind of markup language that we could use to serialize a UI and send it to the client. And you know what would be *really great*? If every client just came with an interpreter for this markup language built in! That way all apps could share a common client, which loads the UI provided by the server and displays it. Will probably never happen though.
[04:38:40] <kuudes> do hot women generally have higher testosterone?
[04:38:45] <quanticle> No?
[04:38:53] <feep> shawwn if you gave me a button to swap bodies with an equivalently aesthetically pleasing woman as me, and let me switch at will, I'd totally take it

[04:39:01] <gwern> shawwwn: I've uploaded plenty of papers on lookism which covers how large it is for both men and women, it's not my fault you don't read the stuff I post
[04:39:13] <Gurkenglas> feep, you dont need scary to build a wish engine, you just need, like, information from the distant future.
[04:39:36] <feep> shawwwn: anyway, you're saying women don't get hired or promoted.... because they're ugly?
[04:39:43] <Betawolf> the sentencing differences are crazy
[04:40:02] <feep> like, you're saying the sufficient criterion for men is "maleness", and the sufficient criterion for women is "pretty"?
[04:40:22] <feep> and this relates to twitter followers how?
[04:40:51] <feep> like, where exactly do you get hired for your twitter follower count
[04:40:52] *** Joins: [itchyjunk] (~itchyjunk@user/itchyjunk/x-7353470)
[04:41:04] <quanticle> feep: Social media influencer is a job
[04:41:15] <quanticle> As is New York Times columnist
[04:41:15] <shawwwn> The fact that ya’ll think it’s strange to say that women get hired or listened to based on their looks is pretty… innocent
[04:41:16] <feep> okay, yes, that is one job, I grant that there may be sexist aspects to this job
[04:41:35] <feep> I presume that was not what shawwwn was talking about tho
[04:42:07] <feep> shawwwn: I mean, let's be clear here, I'm two meters big, I am well the fuck aware that that makes me privileged
[04:42:24] <feep> every time someone listens to me at work I have in the back of my head, "is this because of skills or because I'm big"
[04:42:27] <quanticle> Also, w.r.t. women not getting hired or promoted because they're ugly, isn't that a well documented facts?
[04:42:32] <Gurkenglas> feep, also uhh wouldn't your architectural intuition agree that you can get plenty reflection from simple protocols like plugging the output into the input and just letting it ramble?
[04:42:49] <feep> Gurkenglas: no because that isn't a mode it's trained on
[04:43:10] <feep> that's why I think online learning is such a load-bearing element of the scary stuff
[04:43:25] <feep> cause it lets you kitbash together a shitty reflective architecture that can then *improve*.

In 1933, during the famine that Stalin’s collectivization policies caused, he visited Crimea—his beloved Tauris—and witnessed some of the horrors of starvation, an experience reflected in “Cold spring. Fearful Crimea with no grain.” That November, he wrote an...

[04:44:12] <gwern> ...uncharacteristically straightforward political poem, known as “The Stalin Epigram”: “Executions are what he loves best, / That Ossetian so broad in the chest.” (There’s something displeasing about this limerickish stanza; the original Russian-language version is not Mandelstam’s best work either.) He recited the epigram to friends—attempted suicide by poetry—and someone...

[04:44:40] <feep> quanticle: it wouldn't surprise me, halo effect etc, but I am unconvinced it's gendered, like, something that only applies to women
[04:44:51] <Gurkenglas> though i've been trying to get the source of that claim to use, like, KL divergence to quantify it
[04:44:59] <feep> like women are uniquely harmed by being judged on looks, like men never get judged on looks at work.
[04:45:16] <quanticle> feep: I think it's gendered; i.e. an ugly guy faces less of a penalty than an ugly woman
[04:45:36] <feep> okay, I think that's *possible*, but I'd want a cite on it.
[04:45:40] <shawwwn> feep: for what it’s worth, I didn’t see most of the aspects until Emily pointed them out to me one by one over the years. Eventually she was correct so many times that it got unbearable not to say something
[04:45:43] <quanticle> Okay, I'll try to find one
[04:46:03] <shawwwn> A lot of it isn’t something that can be conveyed in text on IRC. You have to live it
[04:46:20] <kuudes> Gurkenglas, well, yes, that self reinforcing loop is what I see missing in gpt being ai
[04:46:27] <feep> shawwwn: I'm not per se hostile to lived experience arguments
[04:46:31] <Betawolf> how can we live it if it's not in IRC?
[04:46:50] <Betawolf> We'd have to, like, go somewhere else. 
[04:46:52] <feep> shawwwn: but I've also seen plenty of examples where limited lived experience misled people into thinking their problems were unique to their class.
[04:46:52] <shawwwn> Suppose that you wanted a cite for the claim that poverty is expensive. You could easily point to the data. But you wouldn’t know what it’s like not to even *want* to apply to an elite college, because that possibility never entered your mind in the first place. That’s something you have to experience
[04:46:57] <ggreer> "women are uniquely harmed by being judged on looks, like men never get judged on looks at work" <-- most of the people doing the judging in this case are other women
[04:48:02] <gwern> it applies to men quite a bit. I can go to a conference and look around and see not one fat man. they weren't invited. I also can see the difference in how I'm treated after lifting for a few years and losing a good 20 pounds. the lookism for men is partially that standards are much lower for men so it's less obvious than when women dress up, that men are paying a lot less attention to that...
[04:48:08] <gwern> ...discrimination, and it is generally a lot subtler in your mind than "I'd like to fuck that". you just feel warmer vibes and have a halo effect for a handsome man
[04:48:18] <quanticle> feep: My intution is that while men do get judged on looks at work, the thresholds are different. Namely "an average looking guy" encompasses a much broader range than "an average looking lady"
[04:48:38] <kuudes> well, yes, there is general bias toward older but healthy men and younger but healthy women
[04:48:39] <Gurkenglas> kuudes, right, so it seemed plausible that they're assembling tricks to avert the inevitable catastrophes any sane person would expect to follow from that premise
[04:48:39] <quanticle> So you have to far uglier as a dude to face a penalty than as a woman
[04:48:50] <ggreer> oh yeah I'm treated totally differently if I dress nice
[04:48:51] <quanticle> But note: it also applies in the other direction
[04:49:08] <Gurkenglas> ,jj
[04:49:10] <ggreer> also if I wear shoes with lifts
[04:49:14] <quanticle> You have to much better looking than average to be a "hot" dude vs a "hot" lady
[04:49:15] <gwern> 9the good news for guys is that because the bar is so low, you can win your intrasexual competition without all *that* much work!)
[04:49:43] <ggreer> also every single girlfriend has told me something like, "I'm glad I took a chance on you even though you're short"
[04:50:10] <gwern> painful but true
[04:50:14] <kuudes> tallness is indeed less adjustable
[04:50:28] <quanticle> This goes back to what e.g. Aella was saying about camwhoring. Like, if you're 9/10 looks-wise, as a dude, you can barely make a living. If you're 6.5/10 as a girl, you're raking in money
[04:50:35] <kuudes> one can get breast implants, but tallness seems harder to create?
[04:50:37] <gwern> (it's amazing how bigoted women are about height)
[04:51:03] <kuudes> do top hats work?
[04:51:13] <quanticle> No, but platform shoes might.
[04:51:27] <kuudes> stilts?
[04:51:47] <gwern> (and they're so mean about it too, it comes loaded with such contempt and moralizing, like being short makes you a *bad person*. guys discriminate on things like boobs, but it's never like "she's flat-chested, so she's worthless scum lol")
[04:52:04] <kuudes> I mean, for female superstimuli we have J cup artificial boobs. can we replicate that on tallness?
[04:52:08] <ggreer> "I'm glad I took a chance on you even though you're fat." <-- just imagine how quickly a guy would get destroyed for saying that
[04:52:21] <ggreer> kuudes: yeah you get gigachad
[04:52:32] <kuudes> with stilts?
[04:52:41] <ggreer> no. with... steroids and genes and photoshop
[04:52:46] <kuudes> hmm
[04:52:57] <kuudes> but they don't make your head be at higher position
[04:53:28] <feep> slenderman so fuckable
[04:53:34] * gwern is definitely grateful he's not as short as ggreer precisely because it's so hard to change. he can work on all the other stuff like bodyfat or clothes, but height...? shoes will buy you an inch or two, but then beyond that, you're screwed unless you want extremely expensive and life-threatening surgery
[04:54:37] <Gurkenglas> just stand on ggreer
[04:54:49] <kuudes> would it work to wear boots so that ones feet were in the place where normally one's calves are?
[04:55:03] <ggreer> kuudes: you'd walk funny. there's only so much you can do
[04:55:12] <kuudes> yeah
[04:55:20] <kuudes> though that could be trained for?
[04:55:27] <kuudes> ie high heels etc
[04:55:28] <gwern> Gurkenglas: we'll wear a trenchcoat. everyone will be awed at our cumulative height
[04:55:36] <ggreer> no it's like walking in heels. the biomechanics are different
[04:55:54] <kuudes> yeah, knees get higher
[04:55:59] <gwern> we will usurp the Tallest and execute the conquest of the earth
[04:56:25] <catern> you can solve lookism by never interacting with people IRL
[04:56:25] <ggreer> if it's a dress shoe, you can probably get >2 inches of height without anyone noticing. the visible heel and the actual place where your heel is can be different
[04:56:41] <ggreer> but you can't walk as comfortably since your toes are lower than your heel
[04:56:51] <kuudes> what if one would cut off the toes and front of the foot?
[04:57:04] <kuudes> I mean, breast augmentation is surgery
[04:57:21] <ggreer> you can lengthen leg bones but like gwern said, it's expensive and dangerous and painful
[04:57:21] <kuudes> and has sometimes quite drastic negative health effects
[04:57:53] <kuudes> yeah there is that where your leg is cut off and let to heal
[04:58:03] <kuudes> but I am considering if we could just go full cyborg
[04:58:14] <kuudes> ie cut off parts and replace them with plastic and kevlar
[04:58:23] <kuudes> you know, like boob amplification is
[04:58:54] <kuudes> and not start on short people, but aim for superstimuli
[04:59:02] <kuudes> take a long man and then make them even longer

[05:00:00] <Gurkenglas> hmm. some portion of the population do find feet disgusting. you might be on to something
[05:00:27] <quanticle> Some portion of the population find feet alluring as well.
[05:00:45] <Gurkenglas> fine, attach the cutoff legs to someone else, specialize the population

[05:00:54] <kuudes> well, top male politicians are usually not very short

[05:04:05] <feep> hot take

[06:36:45] <gwern> 'If you’re lucky enough and generous enough to use up your exclusions, you may indeed have to pay the gift tax. The rates range from 18% to 40%, and the giver generally pays the tax.'
[06:36:54] <rmmh> looks like ~30% for 100k
[06:37:07] <rmmh> I'm not going to parse the full form 709 to get it more precise than that
[06:37:19] <gwern> ok so the problem here is not necessarily that it's taxed all that much more than normal income but that a 100k lumpsum blows right through the limits unnecessarily compared to giving him $15k/year etc
[06:37:43] <rmmh> sure, and you have to set aside $30k in taxes to pay it
[06:38:03] <rmmh> and it might also complicate some other things by raising your gross income above levels for other benefits, like covid stimulus

[06:53:25] <Ralith> sure, but if you're not realistically likely to non-charitably give away $10M over your lifetime, which is true for approximately everyone, then it doesn't really matter
[06:53:44] <gwern> ie his mom's love literally turned into cold hard cash

The remaining evidence points in the same direction.' https://twitter.com/BretWeinstein/status/1415835355937312771 uh, the whole statistical-signifiance rested on it because the effect size was like 3x the others?
[07:54:24] <|dbotdan> Bret Weinstein (@BretWeinstein, 2021-07-16 00:47): ‘Those who argue that large scale randomized controlled trials are the only reliable evidence in evidence based medicine have misled you. Now you can see why—large RCTs amplify systematic error in addition to signal, whereas meta-analysis amplifies signal, and corrects for error.’
[07:55:06] <gwern> if you've ever wondered why the weinsteins have never appeared in a gwern.net newsletter issue...
[07:55:48] <meowcat> the weinsteins? bret and harvey?
[07:55:56] <quanticle> Presumably Bret and his wife
[07:56:04] <lool0> bret and eric
[07:56:29] <meowcat> oh, bret and his bro
[07:56:33] <saturn2> bret's wife isn't named weinstein
[07:57:11] <meowcat> better than harvey. although "intellectual dark web" confused much more than it enlightened.
[07:57:29] <saturn2> anyway, yes, it appears that they have both come down with a case of twitter brain
[07:57:32] <gwern> I think I might respect harvey more at this point. at least he got things done
[07:57:41] <lool0> they've had a good run
[07:58:02] <gwern> that was *why* he could ask for side benefits on the casting couch, after all
[07:58:39] <meowcat> isn't that a general pro-extortion argument though? "if you are in a position to extort people, you must have something to offer them"?
[07:59:30] <meowcat> generally we don't want extortionists to be able to gatekeep access to public audiences to extract rents
[07:59:36] <saturn2> not really, you could also just threaten them or trick them
[07:59:53] <meowcat> the casting couch is rent seeking.
[08:01:29] <gwern> my point is more that H. weinstein earned his position by savvy film studio founding and curation, and that achievement is worthy of respect. meanwhile, E. and B....
[08:01:32] <meowcat> (seeking to rend dresses or underthings is still rent seeking.)
[08:02:12] <gwern> the casting cough isn't rent seeking, it's either fringe benefits or embezzlement, depending on ownership
[08:02:41] <gwern> I think weinstein's studio was owned, so it was embezzlement
[08:03:40] <meowcat> "self-ownership" is an oversimplification i"m willing to accept for most arguments, though. dude was a highwayman, poaching value from the most valuable people passing through a particular juncture.
[08:04:18] <meowcat> and that's even if one accepts a super-libertarian, almost-incel model of sexual value.
[08:06:35] <gwern> he wasn't a monopolist, and his studio certainly was not. so he damaged the company by taking side-benefits which drove away talented actresses and damaged his and the studio's reputation, and that is all *before* the costs of defending him or the fallout are taken into account
[08:07:00] <meowcat> I wonder how to properly discount that over years of protection.

[08:15:19] <gwern> lool0: I don't really see it as explaining why/how distillation works, just how to make it work. however, I think like grokking and superconvergence it works quite nicely with the wide basin / rough landscape of underparameterized models
[08:15:21] <meowcat> however, i don't know of anyone putting those up because of shame, just as i don't know anyone who put a christian fish on their car because of shame

[08:21:37] <meowcat> i dunno, maybe i just want to walk by a house that has a sign up that says "fear is the mindkiller, whatever can be destroyed by the truth should be" ... this is possibly just gross-ass tribalism on MY part
[08:21:44] <feep> the liberal yard sign is, of course, "Let's talk about it."

[10:02:17] <nshepperd2> of course, it is known that you can get arbitrarily close to your poggers catgirl with reinforcement learning, but if the variance is too high, it will take millions of years to train. that's where the variance reduction methods like A2C and RELAX come in

[10:03:37] <meowcat> i dunno, from well outside it looked like "tech company got scandalized by their pervy users" with an echo of tumblr's porn fail
[10:03:40] <shawwwn> well, to be clear, no one got in trouble for underage sexting
[10:04:16] <shawwwn> any indication of trouble is coming 100% from latitude making an intentional decision that "we have decided this is now trouble"
[10:04:20] <nshepperd2> the people who run ai dungeon had a psychotic breakdownn
[10:04:27] <shawwwn> no one forced them to make the decisions
[10:04:28] <PapuaHardyNet> imagine doing an erotic roleplay chat with an AI and being thrown in prison for it
[10:04:31] <meowcat> oh well maybe that. "holy shit, the people want to pay us to make up kinky stories, we would be so surprised if we ever talked to an internet user" is not credible.
[10:04:34] <saturn2> i thought the CEO or whatever just decided the users were being too degenerate
[10:04:53] <PapuaHardyNet> I've heard that the CEO is a mormon
[10:05:02] <shawwwn> apparently that's not far from the truth. but it wasn't nick.
[10:05:06] <quanticle> Didn't it come out that they'd intentionally trained their AI on a bunch of degenerate smut, and then were shocked *SHOCKED* when the AI started repeating said degenerate smut?
[10:05:40] <shawwwn> X person decided that it was Very Important to introduce the filter
[10:05:41] <meowcat> huh? i thought more "people like to type swears into the computer"
[10:05:48] <nshepperd2> presumably the realization that the degeneracy was inside them all along is what triggered the ongoing psychotic episode
[10:06:22] <shawwwn> I had a long conversation with X. I tried to explain that there was zero chance -- literally zero -- that AI dungeon would *not* be used for sex.
[10:06:41] <meowcat> i mean, i got in trouble in the 4th grade for writing a BASIC program that wrote swears about the teachers, i figured people just type dirty things into AI Dungeon and go with it, and someone later gets scandalized by it.

[10:06:55] <shawwwn> this whole time, I was assuming that OpenAI forced the situation
[10:07:07] <shawwwn> X was saying, well, they probably would eventually. But they didn't.
[10:07:27] <meowcat> nah, the internet is for porn, if you give the internet a text prompt someone will type "hermione cumming hard" into it
[10:07:46] <shawwwn> they did apparently ping latitude just so they were like, aware of the kinds of prompts that were being passed in

[10:10:45] <shawwwn> at this point I just hope Latitude becomes a case study of what not to do, in terms of how to handle AI ethics vs making a profit
[10:10:54] <shawwwn> and that no one anywhere uses them as a model to follow
[10:10:56] <meowcat> lemma: any AI trained on human behavior will pick up on taboo aspects of human behavior more quickly than it will pick up the fact that they are taboo.  this follows from the taboo-ness being undifferentiable or something.
[10:11:15] * shawwwn tries to understand nshepperd2's galaxy brain RL idea
[10:11:18] <meowcat> i.e. it will learn to say swears before it learns not to say swears
[10:11:55] <meowcat> it will learn what the antisemitic jokes are before it learns "antisemitic joke" as a classification that it should avoid saying
[10:12:18] <meowcat> it will be a little shit before it learns to not be a little shit
[10:12:25] <PapuaHardyNet> isn't that how kids work too?
[10:12:29] <meowcat> yup.
[10:12:39] <shawwwn> > to get results that are more similar to plain vqgan+clip gradient descent
[10:12:39] <shawwwn> nshepperd2: how is this different from "current results"?
[10:13:08] <meowcat> because it's easier to learn how to say "niggerniggernigger" and giggle at people's reactions to that, than to learn why this line of text is a bad idea and a hofstadter reference at the same time.
[10:14:37] <shawwwn> > implying that the loss function rewards "niggerniggernigger"
[10:14:47] <shawwwn> in fairness, 4chan would literally train an ai model that way
[10:15:01] <shawwwn> but at present I'm unaware of such trained models
[10:15:46] <saturn2> the AI will never learn to avoid taboos unless you specifically program it to
[10:15:48] <shawwwn> the main problem is that there's so much fucking knowledge that it's hard to sort out what you want to train on vs what you don't. it's not even a question of "is it political/moral gatekeeping?"
[10:15:54] <quanticle> ^
[10:15:58] <meowcat> oh, i was generalizing from "AI Dungeon can be convinced to be a pedophile" to "if enough people pee on the AIs, one of the AIs will enjoy it" or something like that.
[10:16:02] <shawwwn> it's "it's almost literally impossible to filter this"
[10:16:02] <nshepperd2> shawwwn: my dall-e transformer heavily biases the results towards stuff that is present in the danbooru dataset. So for instance, while gradient descent on vqgan+clip can generate a picture of a xenomorph playing chess for you, dall-e will generate an abstract mess like https://zlkj.in/dalle/generated/2798ec619aa0c42d88d8fed00354218a.png since
[10:16:02] <nshepperd2> those concepts aren't represented in the dataset

[10:16:17] <saturn2> you're anthropomorphizing
[10:16:24] <meowcat> yeah
[10:17:16] <meowcat> there's a subspace of "extrapolated human values vs. things AI could wrongly learn from human predecessors" that is "AI is hideous kinky"
[10:17:26] <shawwwn> saturn2: in fairness, once online RL takes off as a training method, it might actually be a fair argument to anthropomorphize in that way, since the loss function will be ... less predictable, since the data is realtime. a preview of things to come, perhaps https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsLup7yy-6I&ab_channel=InternetHistorian

[10:17:59] <Robomot> New evidence of an anomalous phase of matter brings energy-efficient technologies closer -- ScienceDaily (Researchers have found evidence for an anomalous phase of matter that was predicted to exist in the 1960s. Harnessing its properties could pave the way to new technologies able to share information without energy losses.)
[10:18:17] <shawwwn> basically, if the model isn't frozen, you'd better be real certain what data it's learning from, 'cause your users are gonna troll your data inputs
[10:18:44] <lool0> '"In an excitonic insulator, the observed waves of energy are supported by charge neutral particles that can move at electron-like velocities. Importantly, these particles could transport information without being hindered by the dissipation mechanisms that, in most common materials, affect charged particles like electrons," said Dr Akshay Rao from the Cavendish Laboratory, who led the research. "This pro
[10:18:44] <lool0> perty could provide a simpler route toward room-temperature, energy-saving computation than that of superconductivity."'
[10:19:10] <shawwwn> nshepperd2: how does RELAX address that problem? that's interesting
[10:21:35] <nshepperd2> and also the transformer biases toward central examples of danbooru images (there's a kind of regression to the mean) which means it doesn't generate outputs faithful to the prompt even when it 'could' in some sense
[10:22:37] <nshepperd2> my idea is to use reinforcement learning (RELAX) to add an additional loss: i select a random prompt, generate an image from that prompt, and try to maximize how much that image corresponds to the prompt
[10:24:32] <nshepperd2> ideally, this can distill CLIP's conceptual knowledge directly into the transformer, even knowledge about stuff that's not in danbooru

[10:34:08] <shawwwn> that text and images ... just ... share the same latent space
[10:34:25] <shawwwn> so of course you can do the cosine similarity of text vs an image
[10:34:46] *** Quits: igor (~igor@64.44.80.44) (Ping timeout: 268 seconds)
[10:35:32] <shawwwn> but, wait. how is generated_image generating an image via a prompt?
[10:35:38] <shawwwn> did you actually train your own dalle?
[10:35:51] <nshepperd2> basically
[10:36:02] <shawwwn> lol. of course you did
[10:36:25] <shawwwn> in fact
[10:36:33] <nshepperd2> it's not really dall-e strictly speaking, because it doesn't take prompt tokens as input
[10:36:42] <nshepperd2> just the clip embedding of the tokens
[10:36:45] <shawwwn> it's sort of an interesting question to ask "what would happen if you let the model generate random outputs?"
[10:36:49] <shawwwn> i.e. exactly your idea here
[10:36:58] <shawwwn> and the sole goal is, "train to maximize whatever clip thinks the prompt is"
[10:37:22] <shawwwn> I actually ... don't think anyone has done that? weirdly?
[10:37:38] <shawwwn> people have done gradient descent on existing trained gans
[10:37:58] <shawwwn> but training a generator from scratch, using only clip as an objective... that's sort of interesting
[10:38:37] <shawwwn> after all, that is the end goal, isn't it? CLIP is the ultimate oracle
[10:38:46] <shawwwn> and as far as I understand your idea, you're not actually fine tuning clip
[10:38:54] <shawwwn> you're tuning a different model based on clip
[10:38:59] <nshepperd2> yes
[10:39:07] <shawwwn> so that implies that the model could simply be trained directly on clip
[10:39:19] <nshepperd2> i'm trying to imbue my model with clip's oracular wisdom
[10:39:45] <shawwwn> could ... could you just, let it generate random outputs? no need to even train your model separately
[10:39:56] <shawwwn> your idea seems totally solid
[10:40:53] <nshepperd2> sure
[10:40:58] <shawwwn> > cosine similarity of prompt with clip_embedding(generated_image(prompt))
[10:40:58] <shawwwn> this seems like an exact description of how to train the model producing "generated_image"
[10:41:26] <nshepperd2> ofc, it all depends how well this RELAX thing can actually reduce variance
[10:41:44] <shawwwn> but that's the part I don't understand -- why is RELAX (or any other "fanciness") necessary here?
[10:42:00] <shawwwn> your description above seems like a self-contained description of an entire training pipeline
[10:42:15] <nshepperd2> because you can't differentiate the sampling process of a language model
[10:43:06] <shawwwn> if we can differentiate floor(x), we can differentiate any function with discontinuous outputs, can't we?
[10:43:27] <shawwwn> after all, models figure out how to let modulo, floor, etc be a part of the training pipeline.
[10:43:37] <shawwwn> (still screws with me that those are differentiable, but hey, results)
[10:43:55] <shawwwn> so I'm skeptical of the argument that CLIP is somehow so special that it can't be differentiated
[10:44:03] <nshepperd2> you need a 'trick' to generate a gradient for a function that is not normally differentiable
[10:44:20] <nshepperd2> for floor(x) that trick is the straight-through estimator
[10:44:50] <shawwwn> for CLIP, you could perturb the weights slightly and see how the output changes with respect to each weight
[10:44:55] <nshepperd2> for an autoregressive language model you need a substantially more advanced trick if you want it to not be 99% noise
[10:45:13] <nshepperd2> no, clip can be differentiated just fine
[10:45:18] <shawwwn> oh.
[10:45:20] <nshepperd2> it's my generator that can't be
[10:45:32] <shawwwn> but..
[10:45:37] * shawwwn struggles to see why
[10:45:41] <nshepperd2> ofc, you could just use a cnn as the generator if you want
[10:45:46] <shawwwn> right
[10:45:50] <shawwwn> well
[10:45:53] <shawwwn> what were you using?
[10:45:56] <nshepperd2> then differentiating it would work fine
[10:46:03] <nshepperd2> i'm using a gpt
[10:46:18] <nshepperd2> generating vqgan tokens
[10:46:31] <shawwwn> yeah, fuck that. that's always seemed overly complicated for no good reason.
[10:46:36] <shawwwn> I agree that differentiating that would be a mess
[10:46:41] <shawwwn> possible, but a mess 
[10:46:53] <shawwwn> whereas something closer to a GAN generator would... "just work"? maybe?

[12:26:58] <quanticle> The answer to that question is obvious, isn't it? Skreli put up a series of actually pretty good and pretty accessible YouTube videos explaining the ABCs of financial analysis using terms that WSB traders would understand.

[12:30:32] <quanticle> lool0: I thought Shkreli got busted for insider trading and went to jail for impuging the honor of Wu Tang
[12:30:38] <quanticle> *impugning
[12:31:18] <nshepperd2> it was securities fraud, not insider trading
[12:31:23] <quanticle> Ah, okay
[12:31:35] <nshepperd2> but yes, he did disrespect the wu tang clan
[12:31:51] <quanticle> I still don't understand what that has to do with him getting caught out by a bet against the future, though.
[12:32:02] <quanticle> Admittedly, I didn't follow the Shkreli case closely.
[12:32:26] <quanticle> I just know that he dissed Wu Tang, and, in New York, that is apparently a prisonable offense.
[12:32:33] <shawwwn> wait wat
[12:32:49] <shawwwn> stop saying crazy things lol
[12:33:09] <nshepperd2> he went to jail for basically telling his investors 'everythings ok bro' when actually his investment fund had lost almost all its money on betting against the future
[12:33:19] <shawwwn> I like you but one does not have to look far to realize that dissing on wu tang is not the reason shkreli is in prison. unless you're memeing.
[12:33:53] <nshepperd2> he argued that he shouldn't go to jail because he managed to make all the money back by being a wsb god, and actually the investors made a profit in the end
[12:34:02] <shawwwn> yis.
[12:34:33] <quanticle> Ah, okay.
[12:34:49] <shawwwn> there are strange aspects to the story, but they're unrelated to the prison sentence -- sort of. for example, during the case, he somehow vaguely instructed his twitter followers to try to collect a sample of hillary clinton's hair. Good lord, it's so strange that I think I must be misremembering something

[12:35:51] <shawwwn> anyway, disrespecting the tang is perhaps the least of his ... missteps
[12:37:01] <nshepperd2> revoking the bail for that seemed really weird to me. presumably the prosecutors just wanted an excuse to punish his smug face
[12:37:40] <quanticle> In their defense, Shkreli's face is extremely smug and punchable (going back to the debate we had earlier on the effects of being attractive)

[12:40:21] <shawwwn> no, what's that?
[12:40:30] <feep> someone came on reddit and was like, "I did fortune -o and I got a quote from hitler, I feel that shouldn't be in there"
[12:40:53] <feep> and half the thread was immediately like ... "yeah ... you passed the offensive flag and you got ... offended?"
[12:41:42] <feep> and he was like, "no, I use -o all the time, I just feel it shouldn't have hitler quotes" and it sorta eventually turned out all the offensive stuff in fortune had become so milquetoast through years of wearing-down that hitler was the first time he'd genuinely become offended from that section

[12:45:17] <quanticle> Outside of /r/AskHistorians, where the mods ruthlessly obliterate any comment that has less than a thouand words and five references (which leads to entire threads of [DELETED]) every comment thread on Reddit, without fail, is fucking stupid.
[12:45:24] <quanticle> feep: Incorrect
[12:45:32] <shawwwn> it is indeed a bad idea to include hitler advocating for genocide in distros distributed to germany
[12:45:42] <shawwwn> they really don't mess around over there
[12:45:46] <quanticle> I'm saying that *even in comparison to other Internet forums* Reddit is fucking stupd
[12:45:49] <quanticle> *stupid

[12:46:21] <rmmh> quanticle: people poorly optimizing for karma

[12:47:23] <rmmh> and you also, you know, have users with average IQs a couple SDs above the mean
[12:47:23] <feep> humans are mostly like reddit.
[12:47:31] <shawwwn> psssshhh
[12:47:42] <dbohdan> feep: Exactly
[12:47:45] <shawwwn> I reject all three of those ideas firmly
[12:47:48] <dbohdan> Facebook has high-status people showing off
[12:47:51] <shawwwn> especially the higher IQ on HN notion :)
[12:48:03] <quanticle> feep: Yeah, that's fair, on a subreddit like /r/soccer or /r/Formula1. But uh, are you telling me that /r/linux is *not* selected by nerd interest?
[12:48:28] <feep> quanticle: eh, it's a scale.
[12:48:51] <feep> I am saying r/linux is probably easier to find than hnews
[12:49:05] <feep> might even be bigger
[12:49:10] <feep> at any rate, it's less selected.
[12:49:14] <quanticle> Yeah, maybe. In any case, my point stands. Reddit is cancer.
[12:49:28] <shawwwn> mm
[12:49:29] <feep> quanticle, cancer is people! it's people
[12:49:31] <quanticle> Like, if Reddit disappeared tomorrow, I wouldn't miss it.
[12:49:36] <shawwwn> I was going to say exactly what feep said
[12:49:43] <shawwwn> was in the process of typing it out
[12:49:43] <feep> anyway, I'd miss it
[12:49:49] <feep> at least my half-dozen porn forums :P
[12:50:03] <shawwwn> yeah what the hell, I used to use /r/all for porn
[12:50:07] <feep> also a bunch of niche subs can be nice until they grow too big
[12:50:12] <shawwwn> now I literally don't know what the fuck to do
[12:50:21] <shawwwn> apparently /r/randomnsfw is ... something? but meh
[12:50:42] <feep> shawwwn: I just have a bookmark multisub of all the stuff I'm interested in.
[12:50:49] <shawwwn> ah yes, the multisub
[12:50:57] <dbohdan> Imagine have a taste in porn as mainstream as shawwwn's

[12:51:03] <feep> yes XD
[12:51:05] <shawwwn> I know right?
[12:51:21] <shawwwn> but that's only because of exposure
[12:51:27] <shawwwn> if only they injected furry porn into /r/all
[12:51:28] <nshepperd2> i don't think it's illegal to quote mein kampf in germany
[12:51:42] <feep> it isn't
[12:51:43] <shawwwn> nshepperd2: it's not? that would be a relief, because
[12:51:55] <shawwwn> it did bother me to admit it's a bad idea to include hitler quotes in distros to germany
[12:51:55] <quanticle> feep: A while ago, Reddit did a study. There was a popular response to their subreddit shutdowns -- subreddit shutdowns had no effect; the users who were posting racist/sexist/objectionable content would just start new subreddits and continue posting. So they decided to track whether that was true. They found, to their surprise, that it was not. People are lazy, and if you take away their forum,
[12:51:57] <quanticle> they stop talking. But what they failed to consider is that, by that logic, they should just turn off Reddit.
[12:52:01] <shawwwn> but if it's legal, people can just get over it.
[12:52:01] <quanticle> I'm suggesting that they do so.
[12:52:06] <feep> it is legal.
[12:52:11] <shawwwn> mm.
[12:52:32] <feep> it falls under the usual historical context exemption.
[12:52:45] <feep> quanticle: ^^
[12:53:05] <feep> quanticle: anyway, they might just have moved to other forums.
[12:54:13] <quanticle> Your assertion is that it's people being people. No, I disagree. Like rmmh said, there's something about the reddit environment (maybe it's karma-whoring, maybe it's a critical mass of other people people posting dumb shit, I don't know) that causes people to act incredibly dumb. And if you took away reddit, the amount of dumb shit on the internet would measurably decrease, I'm willing to bet.
[12:54:53] <quanticle> I mean, by your logic, a riot is also "people being people", and yet, we don't have riots all the time, do we?
[12:55:22] <quanticle> Environment matters. Norms matter. And reddit encourages shit.

[13:00:06] <quanticle> So... doesn't that prove my point?
[13:01:26] <quanticle> I mean, I'm looking at some Twitter threads right now... and even Twitter is preferable to Reddit for me, I just realized
[13:01:34] <quanticle> Twitter
[13:01:35] <feep> quanticle: no I agree with your point.
[13:01:56] <feep> I meant your description sounded right.
[13:02:55] <quanticle> Okay, so part 2 of my assertion is that creating a "please riot here" zone has the opposite of the intended effect. It encourages more rioting, violence and disorder, which then inevitably spreads outside the zone.
[13:03:10] <nshepperd2> something about reddit i find weird is the whole 'karma whoring' phenomenon
[13:03:14] <quanticle> And that's Reddit's role on the Internet: the designated riot zone
[13:03:56] <nshepperd2> people find highly upvoted past posts and just copy and paste them, for karma

[20:32:27] <two2thehead> Kinda obvious to say, but still
[20:32:30] <nshepperd2> lol
[20:32:44] <shawwwn> is this a dnd joke? I sadly never got the opportunity to partake
[20:33:08] <two2thehead> ah, I don't think I've ever discussed it with you afaik

[20:34:47] <nshepperd2> i imagine being high in the dark tetrad is a lot like be possessed by the drug lord
[20:34:49] <gwern> shawwwn: I'm always impressed by the small details people catch. I didn't notice the employee smoothly hiding her phone on the floor, like she was expecting it all alon
[20:35:05] <shawwwn> lol. I'd be skeptical. I'm not sure anyone who knows me (other than gwern) would think I"m "Psychopathic, narcissistic, Machiavellian, or sadistic"
[20:35:55] <shawwwn> I was way into death videos during my 20's. Tried to find the worst stuff possible. Got really pissed at drug cartels for annihilating women and children
[20:36:18] <two2thehead> huh. Interesting
[20:36:22] <shawwwn> thought about building a website where people could leave anonymous tips.
[20:36:37] <shawwwn> until it eventually dawned on me how retarded that was. sort of.
[20:36:59] <gwern> at least you are in the US. in mexico, narcobloggers get doxed and killed fairly regularly
[20:37:13] <two2thehead> If you are interested, my reading into criminology suggests that it's not the technology per se, it's the median level of corruption in a state
[20:37:24] <shawwwn> yeah, it'd be a tor hidden service. but I wasn't convinced tor hidden services were undoxable (which has apparently been proven true)
[20:37:29] <two2thehead> gwern, TIL.
[20:37:49] <gwern> shawwwn: the cartels don't have tor cracking abilities... afaik. but it's never Tor that's the weakest link
[20:38:01] <shawwwn> the logic was, if you're someone who's doing something for a drug cartel, like packing a bus with drugs, you literally can't narc on them even if you wanted to. Who are you gonna go to? The FBI tip line? you'd just get killed
[20:38:10] <two2thehead> what gwern said
[20:38:33] <shawwwn> but if some website were to become "the go-to source for leaving anonymous tips", there would be an opportunity for such a person to say "a drug bus will be at so-and-so at such-and-such a time"
[20:38:44] <gwern> like, with the DNMs - the only DNM whose *Tor* was actually cracked by CMU+FBI, was SR2, which they'd already infiltrated the hell out of and already had the IPs from blake benthall being a moron and setting stuff up on clearnet
[20:38:50] <shawwwn> which could theoretically be passed along to the right people at the FBI
[20:39:19] <shawwwn> but none of it really works logically. it assumes cartel foot soldiers have empathy or feel badly about what they're doing. nothing I've seen indicates that any of them do
[20:39:25] <gwern> (the actual consequence of the Tor crack there was that they got the IPs of a hundred or so sellers, and with that as a tip could knock-and-talk and followup and arrest some of them)
[20:39:37] <shawwwn> even if they did, they'd never risk the money they're making. so
[20:40:07] <two2thehead> yep. Like I said, median level of corruption in a state
[20:41:09] <gwern> (if you had set up an anti-cartel hidden service, the scenario wouldn't be 'hack teh tors!' but be more like, you'd forget to disable /server-status, a scan would pick it up, they'd social-engineer your host, get your name, look up addresses in any of a bazillion databases, and depending on how much trouble it was and where you were, intimidate you)

[20:42:40] <nshepperd2> don't they put you in a body bag full of rocks to prevent you from floating

[20:43:00] * two2thehead taps the side of his head. BIG THOUGHTS
[20:43:32] <shawwwn> well, in reality, I'd be shipped to mexico, injected with massive amounts of amphetamines to keep me awake, hung upside down, and have random parts of my body chopped off slowly
[20:43:40] <gwern> shawwwn: no, that's expensive. much easier to just send some death threats. especially in the US. the cartels know that everything in the US needs to be kept as quiet as possible. it's not mexico
[20:44:06] <two2thehead> Don't forget being set on fire. That was my 'high point' for torture
[20:44:28] <shawwwn> interestingly I've never seen any "use fire" torture videos. but a blowtorch is probably an option, yes
[20:44:47] <shawwwn> the cartels aren't omniscient or all-powerful, but being in the US is no guarantee
[20:44:57] <shawwwn> after all, they already run drug busses from chicago
[20:44:58] <two2thehead> tl;dr a sicario was claiming the name Ghost Rider (from the comic book series), so some rival gang members kidnapped him and dabbed his face with little drops of gasoline and set that on fire
[20:45:12] <two2thehead> lather rinse and repeat and that's how he was killed
[20:45:23] <shawwwn> I'd probably just be murdered by some random thug they hired here, which isn't too expensive

[22:18:54] <Guest9> even webapp is also fine
[22:19:04] <gwern> the right question is, "I want to accomplish X, how can I do that? it seems like for reasons A, B, and C that I may be forced into the horrible resort of a mobile app trapped in a walled garden owned by a monopolist charging me $100, instead of a sensible web page or desktop tool"
[22:19:10] <Guest9> webapp or mobile app which is easy to build comparatively? gwern

[22:20:00] <gwern> better reread it. that's spaced repetition at work
[22:20:36] <Gurkenglas> Guest9, are you going for coding because wanting this app to exist is a good excuse to learn coding, or do you just want that app to exist?
[22:20:53] <Guest9> i want app to exist, not for learning coding
[22:21:06] <Gurkenglas> Then let's first find out whether it already exists. What should it do?
[22:21:19] <Guest9> i think it is not available
[22:21:21] <nshepperd2> whether mobile or web app, the process is guaranteed to begin, continue, and end in tears
[22:21:42] <Gurkenglas> Guest9, perhaps not your exact case - but there may be an app that's general enough to do your thing too.
[22:21:47] <Gurkenglas> So describe your use-case.
[22:21:53] <Guest9> i am looking for a spelling app. it will spell a word. i.e. perfect (audio) and it will provide all related consonants 
[22:22:13] <Guest9> and all 5 non-consonants
[22:22:23] <Gurkenglas> you want to take microphone input and turn it into letters on the screen?

[22:23:16] <Gurkenglas> Guest9, that was hard to understand, let's try again. What is the input of your program, and what is the output
[22:23:27] <Guest9> and user shall fill in blanl= type a word on screen. if spelling is correct,, will move ahead with anki kind of algorithm if possible (for better progress controls)
[22:25:22] <Gurkenglas> okay so 1. the computer speaks a word. 2. the user types it in. 3. the computer judges whether the spelling was correct.
[22:25:31] <Gurkenglas> And then Anki on top.
[22:25:35] <Gurkenglas> I suggest you use Anki.
[22:25:37] <Guest9> let us say app screen have following things 
[22:25:45] <Guest9> 1) audio of the word offered to user
[22:26:33] <Guest9> 2) all consonants of that word scatterd or arranged sequentially with gaps for missing vowels
[22:26:54] <Guest9> 3) all 5 vowels (so that user dont need to type, instead it can just drag and drop

[22:28:09] <kuudes> is this the same person who asked for english-hindi speech thing?
[22:28:10] <Gurkenglas> Yeah, use Anki. You build an Anki deck like whenever you learn a language, and you put the list of consonants and the audio file on the front of the card, and the proper spelling on the back.
[22:28:15] <Guest9> so user, just need to identify vowels place and quantity and which vowels out of 5 are required in that word
[22:29:15] <Guest9> how to hide all vowels for back?
[22:29:23] <Guest9> i want user interactivity
[22:29:36] <Guest9> from back/for back
[22:29:54] <Guest9> ok it is on front side
[22:29:54] <Gurkenglas> Anki hides the back of the card until the user asks to see the solution.
[22:30:44] <Gurkenglas> The only imperfection in this solution is that you will have to manually create each card. You could write code that automatically generates these cards. That would be much easier than making the app too.

Other people, smarter, made their predictions after the election,...

However, since the outcomes of elections typically differ from the poll estimates by considerably more than sampling error, Deming would argue that this is a system-level, or...
[22:31:19] <gwern> ...“common” cause.

[22:35:30] <Gurkenglas> PapuaHardyNet, the obvious answer to "the api/language is restrictive" is to write a higher-level language that compiles to it, right?
[22:35:39] <gwern> (the 'interruption' thing reminds me of noise pollution studies)
[22:36:26] <Guest9> nope, in writing mode, ulangi doenst have provision to add vowels only
[22:36:32] <PapuaHardyNet> it's less about that and more about the churn rate of not just the API and the language, but also the mental models that you need to have in your head while programming
[22:37:13] <PapuaHardyNet> Guest9: do you want to improve your speaking / writing skills at English / Hindi? If so, take a look at shared decks of Anki
[22:37:21] <Gurkenglas> Guest9, what if you just type in vowels?
[22:37:39] <Guest9> that is another issue. english to hindi & it may need another app Gurkenglas
[22:38:14] <Guest9> as i think there is no problem in identifyiong consonants, so no need ot waste time/focus on consonants
[22:38:19] <Guest9> instead use more focus on vowels
[22:38:50] <Gurkenglas> i think i misunderstood just now. Guest9, my idea was that the user doesn't type in the vowels, he just thinks of what they are, and then sees if he was correct, and then tells anki whether he needs to see the card again
[22:38:53] <Guest9> (except some typical combination like silent character or SH in fashion)

[22:40:46] <Logos01> Lie? To [strike]the internet[/strike] a program?

[22:58:28] <dbohdan> Hmm.  Emojidex's art style (search https://emojipedia.org/person-shrugging/ for "Emojidex" for an example) is rather anime-inspired.  So if the Emoji 14.0 draft is approved, Emojidex will, in fact, deliver on hentai mpreg.

[23:07:53] <gwern> 'I broadly agree with the author that it’s a bit shocking how few people seem to be taking it seriously after OpenAI Five, AlphaStar, GPT-3, Copilot, etc. I think this includes the AI safety space, where as far as I can tell the primary effect has been that it is even more fashionable to have shorter timelines, whereas it hasn’t affected AI safety research very much. However, I do know...

[23:10:58] <Gurkenglas> If you want him to type in only the vowels, you could make an extra field that is just the vowels. If you prepare your deck as a spreadsheet, you can probably write a formula that selects only the vowels from a string.

[23:15:42] <shawwwn> Which is… sadly obvious in hindsight
[23:15:48] <Guest9> yes, so by using global find and replace in spreadsheet, it mayu be easier to format/prepare around 2000+ words 
[23:15:55] <shawwwn> Contrastive loss might be the only way for your idea to work

[23:21:35] <Gurkenglas> Guest9, wouldn't it be better for the user to type in the whole word instead of just the vowels, in order to practice typing the word as well? They're never gonna need to type just the vowels in real life.
[23:22:10] <Guest9> i know but consonants are very easy to identify by anyone
[23:22:14] <Guest9> so why to waste time in that
[23:22:35] <Guest9> instead, same time can be used to practive more words with vowels

[23:25:25] <Guest9> is there any customization possible to pick and select kind of thing in anki?

[23:25:53] <Guest9> from it
[23:26:31] <Gurkenglas> Anki does have multiple choice. Do you want them to also pick the order?

[23:27:14] <Guest9> MxDxM (so user will select A twice from the vowels)
[23:27:48] <ggreer> why would the use spell madam instead of modem?
[23:27:56] <Gurkenglas> You might be able to do two rows of AEIOU to select from in that case. Or you could make two cards, MADxM and MxDAM.
[23:27:57] <Guest9> order is needed for spelling, right Gurkenglas
[23:28:13] <Gurkenglas> ggreer, because the user hears a text-to-speech snippet

[23:29:36] <Gurkenglas> hmm yeah now that i think about it, typing in one vowel per card rather than the whole word seems pretty fast.
[23:29:41] <nshepperd2> shawwwn: anyway half the reason i'm trying to do this insane method with reinforcement learning is then i can 'regularize' it by adding a little likelihood loss
[23:30:03] <nshepperd2> which should force it to higher entropy

[23:30:55] <Guest9> user needs to identify , choose/pick the correct vowels and its order
[23:31:00] <Gurkenglas> Guest9, would you prefer one card "MxDxM" or two cards "MADxM" and "MxDAM"?
[23:31:07] <Guest9> one card
[23:31:12] <Guest9> i want to hide all vowels
[23:31:27] <Guest9> so a bit more stress on user
[23:32:05] <Gurkenglas> Are you sure the user should click on the vowel button instead of typing the vowel on the keyboard?
[23:32:22] <Gurkenglas> thats sorta what the keyboard is for
[23:32:29] <Guest9> clicking would be faster than finding a vowel on keyboard
[23:32:43] <Gurkenglas> that's bad! they should learn where the vowels are on the keyboard
[23:32:46] * nshepperd2 adds in google conceptual captions to the training prompts. yessss, struggle on unfamiliar data
[23:32:55] <Gurkenglas> are you looking at the keyboard right now while typing?
[23:33:00] <Guest9> yes
[23:33:04] <Guest9> but they dont need in future

[23:33:53] <Guest9> for typing speed,i prefer typing tutor softwares Gurkenglas
[23:33:53] <Gurkenglas> you can make a sheet of paper with five holes in it where the vowels are on the keyboard, now they are easy to find
