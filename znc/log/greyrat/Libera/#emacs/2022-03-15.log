[04:31:42] <Everything> Hi all. I set (setq tab-width 8) for text-mode. But it still very erratic. You just never know, how many spaces emacs will insert - 4 or 8 or even 10. I just want ALWAYS 8 spaces. ALWAYS. How to fix this?

[04:33:16] *** Quits: JordiGH (~jordi@user/jordigh) (Ping timeout: 245 seconds)
[04:33:28] <Everything> bpalmer: yes, *.txt
[04:34:25] <ahungry> I like, (setq indent-tabs-mode nil) - that ensures it doesn't try to combine tabs/spaces for alignment - maybe something like that is occurring for you
[04:34:46] <Everything> ahungry: I have this too
[04:34:54] <bpalmer> Everything: ok, the default for text-mode is that TAB is bound to the function 'indent-relative.
[04:35:26] <ahungry> Hmm, then tab-width itself shouldn't be relevant - that's just the display of a TAB character, and doesn't have to do with the indent level/spaces (which you may want set to 8) - it'd only change how a tab (\t) renders
[04:35:26] <bpalmer> Everything: you can verify this with C-h k TAB which should be indent-for-tab-command  and then C-h v indent-line-function RET
[04:35:46] <ahungry> maybe try M-x describe-char on a whitespace to see if its space or tab
[04:35:56] <bpalmer> Everything: in the documentation for indent-relative, "If the previous nonblank line has no indent points beyond the
[04:35:57] <bpalmer> column point starts at, then ‘tab-to-tab-stop’ is done,"
[04:37:20] <bpalmer> Everything: this may explain what's currently happening: it won't be indenting 8 columns if it's relative to the previous line, and it won't be indenting 8 columns if the tab stop list isn't set up in multiples of 8
[04:38:54] <Everything> My current state: indent-line-function is a variable defined in ‘indent.el’.
[04:38:55] <Everything> Its value is ‘lisp-indent-line’
[04:39:03] <Everything> What should I set there?
[04:39:06] <Everything> for text-mode
[04:39:09] <bpalmer> so, if you *really* wanted to, it's straightforward to make a function that just inserts 8 spaces (assuming you want spaces, not tabs), and then bind that to TAB
[04:39:28] <bpalmer> Everything: try indent-relative. It usually works for me
[04:40:14] <bpalmer> lisp-indent-line is definitely the "wrong" function to use for raw text files, so that's an odd configuration.
[04:40:18] <jimeh> Personally I’ve left TAB to just do “corrrect” indentation, and I use separate shift left/right commands if I want to manually indent or undent…
[04:41:55] <Everything> indent-relative is also crazy, inpredictable. Best way so far is ‘tab-to-tab-stop’. My config is not odd, it's almost not configured, this is default value...
[04:42:47] <Everything> Thank you all for the help!
[04:42:55] <bpalmer> Everything: all I can say is, if you have C-h v major-mode RET showing it's text-mode, and TAB ends up running lisp-indent-line , your configuration is not the default.
[04:43:06] <bpalmer> text-mode should never know a thing about lisp.

Now my idea is to extend that to save a timestamp of the last (package-refresh-contents) call(idc if it was successfull for now) and only execute if its older than a week or so. I probably need
[13:58:10] <Guest_135> to add another argument to the conditional in the beginning. Like this https://bpa.st/N73A ? I dont speak lisp ^^ Next up would be implementing the saving of the timestamp. Should I do this right after the call or is there a way to create a hook for saving the timestamp after execution of (package-resfresh-contents) regardless from where the call
[13:58:11] <Guest_135> came ? e.g. call can come from init.el or M-x. ty for your help !

[20:03:41] <taeaad> ski: In the Gödel paper, he defines recursion and then proceeds to write the specification for 40 odd functions such as isPrime() or quote() that you need for his theorem. The atomic type is natural numbers n and formulae are lists of numbers; proofs (or I guess "wrong" proofs, jibberish statements too) are lists of lists of numbers. Between any n -->to--> string(n) you do prime factorisation and the exponents ordered by primes
[20:03:41] <taeaad> p1, p2, ..., pn then recovers a sequence of formulae (a proof).
[20:05:07] <ski> (usually i use `emacs -nw'/`emacsclient -nw' but occasionally i pop up a GUI Emacs, but on this laptop the default face was way too large, making too little of buffers visible (especially after `C-x 3', not seeing eighty columns))
[20:05:18] <taeaad> ski: In the Lisp whitepaper, or most texts on Lisp, you begin with atomic definitions that essentially allows you to have lists and primitive functions operating on the lists. These are recursive, too.
[20:05:43] <Guest_135> gnoo I feel like Im almost there https://bpa.st/N3IA . Maybe its only a syntax error but in line 9 it gives me error `(void-function time-to-number-of-days)` .

[20:05:54] <taeaad> I think that you can take the 40 functions in the Gödel paper and write an implementation of it using a Lisp.

[20:41:52] <taeaad> The metamathematics is not encoded in the "implementation". For this reason he actually talks about whether the Gödel undecidable statement G ("I am unprovable") is true or not separately. In essence the question is whether you can "get to G" (it is provable) or "not get to G" (it is not provable) from the axioms. In both cases you get a problem. For this part he uses a relation, which set theoretically should be a subset of the
[20:41:53] <taeaad> direct product N x N. You can think of this instead as a graph, where n -> m as natural numbers means that formula n implies formula m.

[23:04:12] <dale> I think it just keeps the indent level to whatever the last line was.
[23:04:26] <BrokenCo1> that'd be nice.  I'll give it a try! thanks!
[23:04:44] <dale> I also use edit-indirect to pop SQL in a string literal off to its own buffer for editing in sql-mode: https://github.com/dsedivec/dot-emacs-d/blob/master/recipes/python-edit-indirect-in-strings.el

[23:05:47] <dale> ,edit-indirect
[23:05:47] <fsbot> dale, edit-indirect is https://github.com/Fanael/edit-indirect lets you edit a region in a separate buffer, kind of like org provides for source blocks
