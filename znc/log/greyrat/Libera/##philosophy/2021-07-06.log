[00:03:08] <hovercat> basically a taco salad
[00:03:10] * blkshp doesn't either

[00:04:16] * arryana doesn't eat mexican food
[00:04:19] <pussipupu> both because they seem appropriate and because they're ace
[00:04:24] * blkshp eats sweet and salted popcorn with lindt Dark mint intense
[00:04:44] <pussipupu> I eat Finnish Mexican food occasionally
[00:04:49] <hovercat> bean dip with 6 layers, black beans, pinto beans, salsa, guacamole, cojita cheese. The greens are spinach, red chard and something else I'm not sure about. Tortilla strips are basically chips, but in long rectangles for dipping.
[00:04:50] <lalia> I grew up in Southern Cali and spent a lot of time in Mexico. :P I'm real fond of Mexican food as well as the US takes on the foods.
[00:05:08] <lalia> Especially, like... tamales.
[00:05:09] <pussipupu> which I assume is more Finnish than Mexican
[00:05:21] <hovercat> yes tamales are great.
[00:05:29] <hovercat> its good comfort food.
[00:05:31] <pussipupu> yeah I'll eat that
[00:05:41] <blkshp> "The greens are red chard.." I'm not sure how i feel about this ;)
[00:05:43] <arryana> i'm allergic to onions.  and mexican food is full of them.
[00:05:56] <lalia> My diet includes a lot of beans and rice and tortillas. :3
[00:06:10] <hovercat> allergic to onions? tragic.
[00:06:25] <pussipupu> red chard has a red root and red veins
[00:06:33] <lalia> Yeah onions are a staple, that'd be tough.
[00:06:48] <pussipupu> it's the same family as beetroot but you eat the leaves
[00:06:54] <lalia> pussipupu: it's real pretty veg. I love chard.
[00:07:03] <arryana> it's a pain in the ass, but hardly the end of the world
[00:07:05] <hovercat> pussipupu: yeah but those darker greens are full of vitamins and nutrients you won't find in lighter greens.
[00:07:11] <pussipupu> I'm pro chard
[00:07:24] <pussipupu> I'm not anti green!
[00:07:26] <lalia> I grew rainbow chard last year and really enjoyed it.
[00:07:34] <arryana> fortunately, it's a serious enough allergy that i know almost immediately if i touch onion to my lips or tongue
[00:07:48] <lalia> <3 Scary tho.
[00:07:50] <pussipupu> I just don't speak the same dialect as you so I don't understand everything!
[00:08:13] <pussipupu> can you eat garlic?
[00:08:34] <arryana> so far, yes
[00:08:37] <arryana> and i can still eat chives
[00:08:38] <hovercat> arryana: what about shallots?
[00:08:43] <arryana> not anymore, no
[00:08:44] <pussipupu> that's the main thing
[00:08:50] <arryana> i lost the ability to eat shallots about four years ago
[00:08:55] <hovercat> bummer
[00:09:05] <arryana> they say i'll eventually lose the rest, but so far chives and cooked leeks are okay
[00:09:07] <pussipupu> oh yeah chives, so you get potato salad
[00:09:10] <arryana> but they have to be all the way cooked
[00:09:11] <arryana> yep
[00:09:33] <pussipupu> we have something growing wild that looks exactly like chives but isn't
[00:09:37] <arryana> oooh
[00:09:42] <arryana> is it edible?
[00:09:43] <lalia> If I'm lucky I'll get my friend Rye to join in discussing the varieties of Indian skepticism as we work through the Three Pillars text. They've got a PhD background in the history of linguistics and introduced me to the text in question.
[00:09:48] <pussipupu> the scent and taste is just not the same
[00:09:53] <arryana> hm
[00:10:02] <lalia> I'd be unspeakably excited to discuss with them and it looks like it'll pan out.
[00:10:13] <lalia> Fingers crossed anyways.
[00:10:35] <arryana> it sounds marvelous, lalia
[00:10:40] <pussipupu> all I know about Indian philosophy is I do not fucking understand the tetralemma
[00:11:09] <pussipupu> also the thing about statistics and scepticism messing you don't have to be credulous to know general things
[00:11:48] <pussipupu> *meaning
[00:12:09] <lalia> We would ostensibly get into that at some point, especially since Mills takes time to distinguish between contemprary concerns with skepticism and the ancient traditions which have arguably very different aims.
[00:12:53] <lalia> On my view (and Mills too) the contemprary move to treat skepticism as a philosophical outlook is largely the result of poor readings of the ancient traditions.
[00:13:23] <lalia> The are, rather, more like metaphilosophical projects as I read them.
[00:15:09] <lalia> Part of what I'm exploring is the idea that treating skepticism as a philosophical project is where we arrive at the conclusion that the tradition is somehow contradictory or contains irreconcilable paradoxes.
[00:15:45] <lalia> From where I stand these standpoints are merely misunderstandings of ancient outlooks.
[00:16:19] <lalia> The aim of which were broadly to provide relief of a similar type. :)

[06:53:36] <Derrida> :D
[06:53:58] <Derrida> I couldn't think of an original one so I took this
[06:55:03] <Derrida> although one of the core ideas of Derrida's analysis is that "the author is dead" :P
[06:55:21] <lalia> I enjoyed Of Grammatology. Especially the chapter having to do with Plato's Phaedrus and the Pharmakon.
[06:56:03] <Derrida> well, it seems we are firmly in the postmodern era now
[07:01:39] <lalia> :3
[07:03:02] <lalia> Derrida: Is derrida a favorite of yours or is there another figure or text you're especially fond of ATM?
[07:03:36] <Derrida> the three main thinkers I've been focused on for postmodernity are (myself), Foucault, and Baudrillard
[07:07:21] <lalia> Fun thinkers. Baudrillard's insightful grumpiness has made me smile quite a few times over the years.
[07:08:19] <Derrida> he is the inspiration for The Matrix
[07:08:22] <lalia> None of them are people I've really focused on but I'm fond of what time I've spent with them.
[07:09:11] <Derrida> I don't know that I like pomo thinkers but I have to contend with them
[07:09:40] <Derrida> do you ever feel like we're living in a world, now, where objective truth is vilified and all you have is a set of competing narratives
[07:10:08] *** Quits: dez (uid92154@user/dez) (Quit: Connection closed for inactivity)
[07:10:44] <lalia> I've spent the most time with Foucault between the three, I'd guess. Been through Discipline and Punish and History of Sexuality a few times now, I think.
[07:12:22] <lalia> I'm about 20 years into my philosophy background and still am not sure how I'm comfortable approaching truth, but we do seem to living through a particularly fractious era.

[07:13:08] <Derrida> I love Discipline and Punish, the most positive thing I can say about Foucault is that his analysis of the world through the lens of power.. feels very correct
[07:13:54] <Derrida> and why, a few times, I have had to defend my preference for public hangings vs. a prison industry
[07:15:20] <lalia> I've enjoyed the way others have made use of his thinking most of all, especially in the direction of feminist topics and issues. Probably hooks in particular.
[07:15:43] <Derrida> ahh, you must be a bit older?
[07:16:05] <lalia> She's made use of some of Foucault's insights in her commentary on hegemonic structures of power, it's great work.
[07:16:17] <Derrida> I have read a little of Hooks and Kimberle Crenshaw

[07:24:26] <Derrida> I have had mixed success with arguing and learning through chat rooms
[07:24:28] <Derrida> lol to put it kindly
[07:25:06] <lalia> Makes sense. You'll find that to be the case here too, I'd wager.
[07:25:22] <lalia> We try to keep things amicable... but it's an open forum.

[07:26:19] <Derrida> what do you think about the Greek notion of causality?
[07:26:59] <lalia> Will you say more about what you have in mind with causality? I want to make sure I understand.
[07:27:01] <Derrida> I have been trying to figure this out in my own mind recently, whether meaning is "imbued" within writing, or if it is merely "found" contextually by the person reading what someone else wrote
[07:30:08] <Derrida> the "Derridean" notion would be that language is only defined by its relation to itself, completely separate from the intent of the author, so texts can be re-interpreted infinitely

[07:30:51] <kmh> today's random irc quote: "I can't breathe"  "Yes you can, it's a hoax."
[07:31:05] <Derrida> I find that idea lacking, although I can't articulate exactly wht
[07:34:01] <lalia> Plato seems to have thought an author conveys meaning to text through the use of language or by divine inspiration but he also would have arguably taken this as being consistent with his belief that truth can be somehow understood as something concrete and perfect.
[07:34:35] <lalia> I'm not sure I disagree with Derrida but I can say for sure Plato did. :D
[07:35:34] <lalia> At least based on every reading of Plato I've ever sussed out.
[07:36:29] <lalia> Maybe with the exception of Katja Vogt's reading of Plato... since she's argued he can be convincingly read as a skeptic.
[07:40:23] <lalia> Gotta run. Time for bedtime stuff around my house.
[07:40:31] <lalia> nice chatting, Derrida. :)
[07:42:12] <Derrida> you too
[07:42:19] <Derrida> thanks for the discussion, I apprecaite it
[07:43:56] <amigojapan> Not sure I believe in the Greek concept of casualty but definitely believe in the modern one

[08:35:57] <spruit11> He says that his well-known phrase that there is "nothing outside the text" merely means "that one cannot refer to this 'real' except in an interpretive experience.," (Derrida, 1972, p. 148).
[08:36:44] <spruit11> It's mostly a misunderstood observation but then again all philosophers can claim to be misunderstood.
[08:37:34] *** Joins: denza242 (~denza242@sapphire/support/denza242)
[08:39:30] <spruit11> Derrida's famous phrase, stated in Of Grammatology (1976), that "there is nothing outside the text" sums up his approach. What texts refer to, what is "outside" them, is nothing but another text. ... If texts do not refer to the world then it is impossible to secure through language a foundation for meaning and truth.
[08:39:37] <spruit11> Sounds more in line.

[15:22:57] <arryana> my brother, who was recently caught stealing almost $20k from our mother in hospice, has now told her that he was told he's going to die if he doesn't get another $15k for bariatric surgery.
[15:23:02] <TechTest> how do you control your anger so you don't break your keyboard
[15:23:11] <arryana> ....
[15:23:20] <arryana> why would i take out anything on my keyboard?
[15:23:37] <TechTest> do you code?
[15:23:42] <arryana> no.
[15:23:56] <luminousnine> I do and i wouldn't break my tools
[15:24:01] <TechTest> so you don't get the feeling of a damn code not working
[15:24:06] * arryana rolls her eyes.
[15:24:16] <arryana> yes, because i don't code, i have no idea what frustration feels like.
[15:24:46] <TechTest> well, that's frustration over the computer
[15:24:55] <arryana> the tool has nothing to do with it.
[15:25:07] <arryana> i don't throw knives if i cut something wrong.
[15:25:16] <arryana> i don't smash glass if a lamp doesn't work
[15:25:20] <TechTest> I know it's not the computer's fault, but I can't help blaming it to the computer or the keyboard or the mouse even
[15:25:27] <arryana> okay...

[15:27:47] <lalia> Funny story: I had a friend from LAN parties growing up with a terrible temper about taking a hard loss.
[15:27:49] <TechTest> I talked about anger control
[15:28:10] <TechTest> never claimed I have good anger management tactics
[15:28:23] <lalia> He would bring a big dufflebag full of headsets, keyboards, and mice to LANs with him because he would inevitably smash one or more during the course of the night.
[15:28:28] <arryana> hahah
[15:28:33] <lalia> Hilarious to reflect on now.
[15:28:47] <arryana> i have only ever deliberately broken one piece of electronics
[15:28:57] <lalia> He was also a super gifted developer and designed many of my favorite Quake maps.
[15:29:11] <TechTest> my keyboard costs 125 bucks I probably shouldn't smash it
[15:29:14] <arryana> when my ex first became addicted to gaming, and i had run out of all reasonable options to get through to him, i picked up his playstation and spiked it to the floor.
[15:29:34] <TechTest> it's an ergonomic keyboard that is supposed to help with epicondylitis (it doesn't)
[15:29:34] <lalia> I bet that felt cathartic. :D
[15:29:35] <arryana> i ended up having to repair it because he was going to go spend our rent money on a new one.
[15:29:38] <arryana> he had a -real- problem
[15:29:39] <arryana> still does.
[15:29:47] <arryana> eh, i don't like breaking stuff.
[15:30:01] <arryana> unless it's something like tile or glass for a mosaic
[15:30:24] <lalia> My desire to play games largely died over the course of parenting the last five-ish years. :D
[15:30:29] * arryana nods
[15:30:43] <arryana> i finally just divorced him
[15:30:53] <arryana> he went back to his childhood bedroom at his parents' house and still lives there
[15:31:32] <arryana> can't say i miss him.
[15:31:38] <lalia> I'd be happy to catch a match of hearts over drinks now, that sounds like a great time. Otherwise I'd probably choose a nap at this point. :D
[15:31:49] <arryana> hahah
[15:32:10] <lalia> I'd say I'm delightfully divorced now too. Much happier with my current situation.
[15:32:15] * arryana nods
[15:32:16] <lalia> A strange thing to reflect on tho.

[16:02:22] <arryana> and yes, i'm happy to pay for that.
[16:06:13] <arryana> the breeder i bought my own dogs off should charge double what she does.  all of her bitches are health and genetic screened, as are any stud she puts them to, and their lines are checked for compatibility five generations back.  she sleeps on the floor with them for the first three and a half weeks, she has them experience everything from cats, hats, bears, long skirts, and helmets, and
[16:06:13] <arryana> begins their house training before they go.  they listen to 'saving private ryan' loud while being played with so they never develop a fear of fireworks or sudden noises.  each puppy comes with a pack including photos of sire and dam, pedigree, the dates they were weighed from birth, food, water, toys, paper towels, poo bags, and half a dozen other things.
[16:06:39] <arryana> she also reclaims any dog she has ever sold and cares for it herself if the owners can't keep them for any reason.

[21:53:05] <pussipupu> I'm not embedded in the US context but it seems like the assault on "critical theory" isn't really an assault on critical theory, it's just a convenient bogeyman
[21:53:24] <lalia> I'm super confused. What do you think this has to do with accounting for the historical tendency towards eurocentrism in academic philosophy? Because I refered to it as a way of partially agreeing that the focus on Greek philosophy has been a problem in some sense.
[21:53:49] <lalia> Yeah, the critical theory debate is sad and misleading.
[21:55:00] <lalia> I tend to avoid addressing it just because I have a background involving some of the relevant thinkers and I don't like wasting my heartbeats frivolously on the arguments as a result.
[21:55:25] <lalia> pussipupu: I probably agree with your observation tho, to be clear. :)
[21:55:41] <spruit11> I am just saying there's some societal pressure on philosophy departments to stick to safe studies
[21:56:01] <lalia> Oh that seems like a relevant concern too, sure.
[21:57:24] <lalia> Academic sanitizing, I've heard it called, is also something worthy of constant address until it stops being a critical concern.
[21:57:42] <spruit11> I don't know what that is?
[21:59:08] <lalia> It's a phrase used to describe the bureaucratic move to ban or otherwise constrain the material available to educators for forming academic curriculum.
[21:59:27] <spruit11> ah
[22:03:08] <spruit11> I never found it too much of a coincidence that one of the most famous philosophers the US produced is Peirce,  a pragmatist
[22:03:30] <spruit11> stuff just is.  don't overthink it
[22:04:42] <lalia> Peirce's theory of semiotics remains novel and interesting IMO.

[23:06:56] <lalia> On the other hand, tools like Roll20 have become such a wonderful asset.
[23:07:08] <spruit11> could be interesting

[23:08:29] <lalia> I'm certainly going to be pouring my background into it, so nobody will be surprised to see the influence of ancient cultures. :D
[23:09:18] <lalia> The setting is based on developing my own taxonomy for gobliniods as well as a metaphysics for accessible magics.
[23:09:33] <lalia> So we'll see how it pans out. :)
[23:09:54] <spruit11> neat.  become a fantasy writer!
[23:10:15] <lalia> I am one, I just don't do it for a living and my contributions are all D&D adventures.
[23:10:18] <spruit11> I would read your books although I cannot give you assurances I would buy them
[23:10:23] <pussipupu> My weirdest things are probably the linguistics and unusual sex and gender systems
[23:11:24] <lalia> My adventures are all old now too. The last time I wrote anything to completion was for a Dungeon Mag issue during the 3.5e era.
[23:11:30] <lalia> So... it's been a while. :P
[23:11:42] *** Joins: skapata (~Skapata@user/skapata)
[23:11:43] <pussipupu> it's still the 3.5e era
[23:11:53] <pussipupu> Forsake the 5th heresy
[23:11:54] <lalia> For me, absolutely! :D
[23:12:06] <lalia> Tho, I tend towards Pathfinder for that family of systems now.
[23:12:11] <pussipupu> Though to be fair also just homebrew ideally
[23:12:41] <lalia> I getcha. I like homebrewed settings at the very least and I tend to suggest a ton of house rules over time.
[23:13:08] <lalia> It inevitably winds up being fairly customized in my games.
[23:14:06] <pussipupu> I find d20 is fine up to q point but it doesn't fit with all metaphysics
[23:14:16] <lalia> I run mostly 5e games for the players I have RN, but I've learned to adapt pretty well and have started discovering alternative mechanics from 3rd party texts I really like.
[23:14:29] <pussipupu> q.v. the abomination that was d20 L5R
[23:15:19] <lalia> Monte Cook introduced a mechanic called Cyphers that use special items and abilities for driving the narrative arc and distributing experience.
[23:15:34] <lalia> There's also the Icon system from 13th Age.
[23:15:57] <lalia> Really cool ideas for building intricate narratives using 5e mechanics.
[23:16:42] <lalia> L5R is a great setting that's been through a ton of mechanical woes.

[23:17:09] <lalia> pussipupu: I have a friend who's been writing material for that setting since before we finished our undergrad work.
[23:17:11] <pussipupu> The original p&p system is great
[23:17:12] <lalia> She's really into it.
[23:17:15] <lalia> Her husband too.
[23:17:22] <pussipupu> as is CCG of course
[23:17:57] <lalia> Yeah, super cool aesthetics and general narrative points. The metaplot is killer.
[23:18:01] <lalia> Am a fan.
