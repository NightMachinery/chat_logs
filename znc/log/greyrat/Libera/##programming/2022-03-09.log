[00:22:00] <bjs> dan01[m]: so two ways, first is just to load the value using arithmetic. (load 16 bits, shift, add, shift, add, etc). the second and more common is to use the other clever trick I mentioned which is to use relative offsets.
[00:22:05] <oldlaptop> dan01[m]: There is an instruction to load the contents of memory at some address to some register, and another instruction to store the contents of some register to the memory at some address.

[00:31:06] <dan01[m]> And then the system bus is also 64 bit
[00:31:23] <oldlaptop> Ah. Yeah, I think most LSAs don't allow for 64-bit immediates.
[00:31:33] <oldlaptop> Or 32-bit ones for that matter.
[00:31:45] <oldlaptop> amd64 (for example) does not have fixed-length instructions, but it also is not an LSA.

[00:35:16] <bjs> dan01[m]: so instead say, the "LDR (literal)" instruction has a 19-bit (I just checked) field for the address.  And what the CPU does is take this value and adds it to the current PC, to get a full 64-bit address

I'm looking forward to finding a real job where I'd program what's on the menu at that point

[07:14:00] <Decker> github was developing a general code parser too... don't remember what it was called; but one sytaxer to rule them all ?
[07:14:05] <Decker> syntaxer
[07:14:38] <sonny> ast?
[07:14:47] <sonny> that sounds really difficult
[07:15:20] <sonny> I guess you could group some like java, c#, c++
[07:15:27] <Decker> but to reverse into any langauge syntax too
[07:16:07] <Decker> even most transpilers for JS are one way and somewhat specialized
[07:16:15] <lf94> there's this one language
[07:16:20] <lf94> I think it's literally called...
[07:16:23] <lf94> "onelang"
[07:16:28] <lf94> does what you're talking about
[07:16:39] <lf94> does a good job too
[07:16:41] <sonny> I thought compilers were generally one way
[07:16:56] <lf94> two way compiler -> mind broken
[07:16:59] <sonny> an invertible compiler is science fiction isn't it?
[07:17:05] <lf94> i think no
[07:17:08] <lf94> well
[07:17:11] <lf94> mmm
[07:17:26] <sonny> lf94: reverse tools do exist so it's not impossible
[07:17:29] <Decker> not between sources shouldn't be any loss of information
[07:17:38] <sonny> but how do you know it's the original program
[07:17:47] <sonny> language would have to be small
[07:17:50] <lf94> unit test :^).
[07:18:01] <Decker> but  there would be - like in JS array.map( callback ) re-implemented in C would look a LOT different
[07:18:28] <Decker> and C's index into strings sort of ports forward - but not really... there's no real difference betwen 'a' and "a'
[07:18:28] <lf94> sonny: for all valid inputs, do they match all the outputs
[07:18:32] <Decker> "a"
[07:18:56] <lf94> back to "should we think of all programs as FSM"
[07:19:16] <Decker> well they are... so .. what's the alternative?
[07:19:28] <Decker> it's not that we have to think about them that way no...
[07:19:39] <lf94> yeah yeah. I agree, they are
[07:19:46] <lf94> But we think about them in different ways, yeah.
[07:19:58] <lf94> I'm coming from a background where I deal with web interfaces
[07:20:03] <lf94> and "states" are a big thing
[07:20:12] <lf94> but I think states are also a thing in larger business systems.
[07:20:22] <lf94> (It was in a KYC system I wrote)
[07:20:42] <lf94> I think I need to focus on writing systems that utilize FSM thinking even more
[07:21:09] <sonny> you already do
[07:21:22] *** Quits: wedr (~tom_mai78@pool-108-20-128-8.bstnma.fios.verizon.net) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[07:21:42] <sonny> that's the whole deal about imperative languages
[07:21:52] <lf94> You think majority think about FSM when writing? I really dont
[07:21:58] <lf94> If you think yes then I'm an odd ball
[07:22:02] <Decker> I find my approach for developing webservices is modelling them as FSMs... not nesscicarily like there's a state the code is in... like a specific implementation of a state machine (a int with state and a switch)... 
[07:22:09] <sonny> not explicitly no
[07:22:41] <Decker> but a lot of things have a chain of events that's a process... and each state completion has its own criteria to form a resolved state at the end
[07:22:42] <lf94> Decker: that's what I mean though. I think there could be a more explicit way of modeling systems as FSM which everyone could follow.
[07:22:49] <lf94> Yeah true.
[07:23:08] <sonny> UML?
[07:23:12] <lf94> I guess concurrency (promises) really throws a wrench in things, and then you move onto process calculus and crap
[07:23:15] <Decker> so I start with general objects - the parameters of states - related state parameters?
[07:23:18] <lf94> I like UML to be honest.
[07:23:33] <sonny> looks fine to me
[07:23:43] <lf94> As a young adult I hated those modeling tools.
[07:23:50] <Decker> ya but UML doesn't have a 'get out of this process' and 'resume back into this process' 
[07:23:58] <lf94> I realized a few years later...I was naive.
[07:24:12] <lf94> Lately I've LOVED the BPMN.
[07:24:17] <sonny> I don't know if UML can handle (nested) invariants either

[08:37:45] <amigojapan> unless you mean code would be the code to handle it
[08:38:20] <Decker> if you wanted operators to work in an expression from somewhere you'd have to code a parser yourself... or use like acorn which can parse JS syntax, and evaulate the tree yourself
[08:38:25] <Decker> right
[08:38:47] <Decker> well no the code the code to run for the function?  and but that doesn't get any closer to operators
[08:39:13] <Decker> it's not worth it :) use a chain function based API 
[08:39:29] <Decker> pretend it's C and you don't have operator overloading just function names

[08:43:40] <amigojapan> Decker: oh yeah I found osmething simillar to that function i was thinking of, the answer to this, just use a regex to get the operator, and the use the actual thing like x.div.y so you can have your "operators" in a neat string, even if there is no such thing as operator overloading this works https://php-decimal.io/#installation

[08:51:43] <amigojapan> I am not suggesting eval but pregmatch
[08:51:54] <Decker> use regex to parse the string?
[08:52:08] <Decker> sure makes sense I didn't think it might be quite that easy but there are only a few operators
[08:52:09] <amigojapan> yes
[08:52:38] <Decker> no sorty of native acceleartion and then your useful expressions are all in strings and don't get syntax highlighting

[14:11:12] <piou> I'd say knowing S to open a shell in the current directory, r to open with the program of your choice, cd, rename and bulkrename, sorting with os/on, you have most of what's really useful in ranger for the day to day, the rest is comfort like tagging, quick filtering
[14:11:38] <epony> tagging is nice
[14:12:03] <epony> you can also cheat and use the file management options of text editors ;-)
[14:12:15] <epony> or canonical (two pane FMs)
[14:12:17] <piou> I love the command line, I spent the last 15 years in a shell, but nobody will convince me that this cd;ls;cd;ls;cd;ls routine we all did is better than a proper file manager
[14:12:39] <epony> it can be semi-automated
[14:12:46] <piou> not to say I never cd tab tab, but still
[14:12:53] <epony> with implicit cd and fuzzy select etc
[14:13:08] *** Joins: Yesmon (Yesmon@user/Yesmon)
[14:13:33] <epony> but it's also beneficial to use tree and find commands
[14:13:40] <epony> (locate etc)
[14:13:43] <piou> find is good
[14:13:46] <piou> I know a lot of people like fuzzy select to common directories, it just doesn't click with me
[14:14:04] <piou> I don't find it pleasant at all to use
[14:14:30] <epony> I use it for "interactive" manipulation on results of previous commands that would need "intervention"
[14:14:47] <epony> you can also set directory aliases
[14:15:13] <epony> and those work for expansion on the command line too
[14:15:24] *** Parts: nulleip (~luiz@user/nulleip) ()
[14:15:33] <piou> sure
[14:16:11] <epony> so.. there are power tools and interactive helper utilities that make file managers.. less critical

[14:18:04] <piou> that I agree with

[14:22:23] <epony> well, you get manual pages to help you
[14:22:31] <Numocha> I don't want to go back to a GUI file manager to easily find the files/programs I need
[14:22:44] <epony> some silly shells have extensive auto-complete that can work as "discovery" tool for novice users
[14:22:56] <Numocha> by silly you mean fish?
[14:23:03] <epony> yes
[14:23:05] <Numocha> I use fish exclusively as an interactive shell lol
[14:23:14] <epony> but also zsh and bash have that too
[14:23:19] <Numocha> I can't go back to bash anymore when fish comes with automplete out of the box
[14:23:58] <davve> does fish support vi modal editing?
[14:24:06] <epony> of course you can, it's not a religious conversion
[14:24:18] <davve> that is a make or break feature for me :D*

[14:24:39] <Numocha> fish has better vi modal editing than bash
[14:24:53] <Numocha> it actually shows you what mode you are currently in so you dont have to spam Esc
[14:24:53] <davve> better than zsh?
[14:25:00] <davve> because its pretty good
[14:25:15] <Numocha> Bash's vi mode is like OG vi. No indication of what your current mode is
[14:25:22] <Numocha> Whereas fish's is like vim
[14:25:31] <davve> sounds interesting
[14:25:55] <epony> experienced users keep a mental map of the modal status, as if it's the shift key / toggle register
[14:25:56] <Numocha> but tbh I am guilty of pressing backspace lol
[14:26:09] <Numocha> since command line inputs are often short
[14:26:10] <piou> Numocha: you shouldn't compare fish with bash, but with zsh really
[14:26:33] <Numocha> I don't use zsh so I can't say anything about it
[14:27:42] *** Quits: nulleip (~luiz@user/nulleip) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[14:28:03] <piou> Numocha: good autocomplete? check. syntax highlighting? can be enabled. uses a syntax that is really close to bash so you'll never feel lost at someone else's command line? absolutely, there are hardly any differences if you only use the simple stuff (ie: use it as if it were bash)
[14:28:28] <piou> and the only differences are things that are easier to grasp with zsh, so it's bash that's surprising
[14:28:52] <Numocha> yeah well fish is working fine for me haha
[14:29:04] <Numocha> but I do admit sometimes there are stuff about fish that makes me wanna pull my hair out

[14:29:17] <piou> sure, no worries with that, fish is fine
[14:29:25] <Numocha> And having to google the solution to fish specific problems
[14:30:04] <Numocha> certain things like removing aliases are done differently
[14:30:08] <piou> I'd rather not have to learn two very different syntaxes personally because I often work on servers that aren't mine and it makes writting sh scripts that are widely compatible easier
[14:30:12] <Numocha> since in fish they are all functions
[14:30:34] <Numocha> piou: yesm which is why I was planning to learn POSIX shell scripting first and foremost
[14:30:47] <Numocha> in order to have POSIX compliancy
[14:30:48] *** Quits: chiselfuse (~chiselfus@user/chiselfuse) (Remote host closed the connection)

[14:31:22] <Numocha> tbh am kind of tempted to try out zsh, see what the fuss is aobut

[14:32:51] <epony> fine for interactive and login mode is not the same as system default or system wide scripting shell
[14:32:52] <piou> (for anyone wondering, when I talk about differences about bash and zsh syntax, the only one that comes to my mind is how in bash you need a semicolon at the end of a one-line function definition:    function testfunc() { ls ; ls ;}    versus    function testfunc() { ls ; ls } in zsh
[14:32:57] <piou> )

[14:33:20] *** Quits: NeoFAT32 (~UserNick@user/NeoFAT32) (Remote host closed the connection)

[17:56:50] <GeDaMo> I wonder if something like that could work for Android
[17:57:02] <deniska> nomagno: that means comma, I need backslash and comma, that'd be \\,
[17:57:28] <deniska> if you introduce an escaping character, you need a mechanism for escaping the escaping character itself
[17:57:44] <nomagno> deniska: ... Matrix IRC bridge must be interpreting double backslash as backslash
[17:57:53] <nomagno> In sending double backslash lol
[17:58:09] <nomagno> backslash backslash comma -> backslash comma

[17:58:12] <amigojapan> GeDaMo: I think such an app would be easier to write in say something based on cordova, cause we could just use eval("write your program here") to allow the user to write their own programs

[21:22:29] <Raziel> this is clearly a basic exercise so I doubt they want you to do dynamic memory management for it

[21:23:10] <Decker> might as well use strdup - but the problem is to reverse the string
[21:23:19] <Decker> so no KillerWasp that's not right :) it's len-i-1
[21:23:35] <KillerWasp> Decker: why len-i-1? is much garbage here

[22:09:35] <user51> as long as it's worth it
[22:09:59] <Decker> well ? is it?  I mean just model the earth as a flat plane that has no mass ? :) cheat?
[22:11:33] <Decker> but I saw a good youtube video once on all the ways physics engines suck... like putting a heavy object on top of a small object on a static object... the required 'force' for the small mass to push the big mass becomes incredibly huge (basically the velocity goes to infinity and blows up)

[23:29:09] <cockatoodude> before vectors? a binary input system.
[23:29:36] <cockatoodude> Everything is true or false at the lowest level, or both if you take into account quantum effects of non-observable things
[23:30:00] <cockatoodude> You need to make your binary inputs, or some other inputs, translate.
[23:30:21] <cockatoodude> I'd use ML honestly, and I think ML is a fad that will never be perfected or a final AI solution
[23:30:28] <ProfSimm> cockatoodude: I think true/false may be a wrong concept to put at the base.
[23:30:42] <ProfSimm> cockatoodude: more like it's A or B, but true/false is subjective
[23:31:24] <ProfSimm> cockatoodude: is ML binary though. It seems like a graph of floats with arithmetic relationship
[23:32:02] <cockatoodude> ML is binary in a sense. everything either adds up to 1, or is as equally invaluable as being 0

[23:53:59] <nomagno> So you need infinite precision to describe the relation between its radius and its circumference
[23:53:59] <pyzozord> nomagno: ok, well sorry about that, I thought you'd get some inspirations. They have few more on git, maybe you'll have more luck with others
[23:54:16] <ProfSimm> nomagno: what's interesting about pi, and the pythagoras theorem is how the f can you rotate an object in space and retain its properties.
[23:54:27] <ProfSimm> nomagno: something weird about spatial dimensions
[23:54:52] <ProfSimm> nomagno: consider the complex plane. You have a pretty basic concept of how to rotate 90 degrees
[23:54:53] <nomagno> Pythagoras theorem cringe
[23:55:17] <ProfSimm> nomagno: you have also the function that describes smooth rotation as the unit circle
[23:55:29] <nomagno> Cosine theorem cooler
[23:56:06] <ProfSimm> nomagno: why is it always square roots of sums of squares tho
[23:56:15] <ProfSimm> nomagno: even in N dimensions
[23:56:43] <nomagno> ProfSimm: Goniometric circumference

[23:57:35] <nomagno> ProfSimm: Oh, always square roots of sums of squares?
[23:57:57] <nomagno> That's because math
[23:58:04] <nomagno> I mean, it's constants
[23:58:08] <ProfSimm> nomagno: distance = sqrt(x*x + y*y + z*z ...)
[23:58:18] <nomagno> 'The universe' is the reason

[23:59:00] <ProfSimm> nomagno: how do you rotate from the x axis to the y axis in the complex plane
[23:59:00] <nomagno> All formal sciences and formal disciplines essentially reach the conclussion its unpractical to reason under information asymmetry
