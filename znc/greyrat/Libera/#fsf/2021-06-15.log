[07:07:19] <lightbringer> well, what i meant that it seems to be more rasengan & co. not knowing what they're doing than trying to get rid of users and destroy the network
[07:07:54] <lightbringer> because there are much faster, more direct and easier ways of doing the latter
[07:08:11] <kline> given that nothing seems to have been tested (new mailserver with no spf/dkim config, but a strict policy still in place in DNS) makes me think hes genuinely just decided to get fucked up and crack on with no common sense applied

[11:49:02] <neox> leah, wtf that's hilarious 
[11:49:06] <leah> it's not mentioned on their site yet
[11:49:21] <leah> i re-registered all my channels. a few other people did aswell, so far
[11:49:25] <leah> but it's chaos
[11:49:28] <leah> absolute madness
[11:49:36] <leah> it's like the world is on fire
[11:49:49] <fef> just madness
[11:50:13] <leah> i explained the situation to my roommate, who is the least technical person ever, and the least interested in IRC
[11:50:18] <_________> https://www.devever.net/~hl/freenode_suicide :)
[11:50:20] <leah> and she thinks it's stupid too
[11:50:21] <fef> thats big news
[11:50:37] <leah> well that news article is hyperbole
[11:50:44] <leah> but it does mention some events yes

[11:53:14] <leah> anyway
[11:53:29] <fef> who got this wild?
[11:53:29] <leah> oldnode is still online for the next few days apparently
[11:53:41] <leah> i'm gonna log into it until it dies
[11:53:44] <leah> and just go apeshit
[11:53:58] <leah> well
[11:54:06] <leah> no, i just want to watch the world burn
[11:54:30] <leah> chat.freenode.net no longer ever points to the old services anymore
[11:54:39] <leah> but that page you linked lists old servers, and their IP addresses
[11:55:01] <leah> ah well, not IPs for old ones, but hostnames for some old ones
[11:55:06] <leah> rinnegan fer instance
[11:55:19] <_________> I removed all my nicks on freenode as soon as libera was up, so it doesn't affect me at all.
[11:55:32] <leah> easy for you
[11:55:40] <_________> yeah ;)
[11:55:53] <leah> not so easy when you're me, and have people who want you dead, or want to destroy you
[11:55:54] <fef> hi dash
[11:55:54] <_________> I wish it was as easy dropping gmail as this one was ;)
[11:56:01] <jpp> hi leah 
[11:56:07] <leah> someone actually impersonated me earlier on new freenode
[11:56:11] <leah> and got k-lined
[11:56:18] <fef> me too
[11:56:21] <leah> i had to get staff to unban it, and release it
[11:56:38] <leah> then i registered it. now i'm leah on new freenode, just like on the old one
[11:56:44] <fef> didnt do a thing after few hours it was unban
[11:56:45] <leah> (freenode staff i mean)
[11:56:51] <leah> tell you what though
[11:56:57] <leah> the staff is super efficient
[11:56:59] <leah> insane
[11:57:08] <leah> but efficient. they helped me very quickly
[11:57:12] <jpp> #libreboot est sur libera leah ?
[11:57:26] <leah> what language is that lol
[11:57:35] <neox> leah, frenchcrypto 😉
[11:57:48] <leah> yes it exists on libera (and freenode. i'm not shutting it down. in fact, i literally re-registered it after freenode launched new ircd)
[11:58:06] <leah> (i will never move away from fn. i'll merely also also other networks that appear)
[11:58:16] <leah> oh
[11:58:19] <leah> sorry, this is #fsf
[11:58:21] <jpp> thanks leah :)
[11:58:25] <leah> thought i was in #libreboot for some reason, sorry
[11:58:28] <fef> freenode was home
[11:58:32] <fef> :(
[11:58:33] <leah> i can rant in #libreboot, because that's mine
[11:58:37] <leah> but this is #fsf
[11:58:41] <leah> ggoes: sorry for spamming here
[11:58:59] <fef> they are sleep
[11:59:05] <leah> i've literally been up all night because of this bullshit
[11:59:07] <leah> with freenode
[11:59:20] <leah> i really hope they calm down soon
[11:59:31] <leah> i was *this* close to just leaving freenode. but
[11:59:44] <leah> well, you see, i'm british. i have more patience :P

[12:09:33] <leah> i heard this through the grapevine
[12:10:03] <leah> i'm actually neutral, but i'm friends with... 1 staff member, and 1 person who's about to become one. i'm also frineds with some libera staff. so i hear things
[12:10:21] <leah> if that's true, i think it'll be great. they shouldn't just nuke the old one outright

[16:04:38] <opal> i was able to ignore it for the most part
[16:05:28] <opal> i tried qutebrowser as well and the compilation times + the amount of tweaking i have to do to make it usable isnt worth it

[16:44:32] <vivien> I use GNOME Web (epiphany) for websites that don’t work with icecat + tor + librejs
