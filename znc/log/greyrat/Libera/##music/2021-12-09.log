[22:52:33] <murthy> Panther: people for the system
[22:52:47] <Panther> They are for it, because it is all they know.
[22:52:50] <murthy> Panther: system of morons is good for nothing
[22:52:59] <murthy> Panther: ah that I agree
[22:53:06] <Panther> morons are typically in assisted living.

[23:42:55] <Panther> Belt squats aren't hard on any joints.

[23:43:17] <Panther> If you put the belt on right, or you could injure your lower back.
[23:44:18] <Panther> I like them, but this machine is a total PITA to set up for them.
[23:45:59] <Panther> It is very hard to get out of it.. you are locked to the cable in a position where you are squatting all the way down, so it's not easy after a hard set to sit in a squat and fiddle with the carabiner to get loose.

[23:59:06] <murthy> No, it's a cocktail the protesters make to use it as a first aid for tear gas
[23:59:07] <DOMF> I don't know how easy spotify's api is to use/obtain a key for
[23:59:37] <Panther> That was much better... 10 w/o + 5 with.
[23:59:39] <murthy> I forgot the ingredients. I will watch the video and tell you later
