[00:00:21] <Abdullah> I wrote a script which checks for unread mail count in remote mail server and prints out the unread mails count to screen. so if there is a new mail in remote server, it should sync remote and local mailboxes. and play a notification bell. now both mailboxes are same, so it shouldn't sync or play notification bell. if there is a change in local mail server, (like I have read the new mail), it should
[00:00:23] <Abdullah> sync so both are again same. if there was a new mail in remote mailbox, it has synced the mailbox with local mailbox, so it shouldn't play notification bell next time for that same new message. I mean only should play notification bell if there is another new mail. But I'm confused how to do it. Here is my script. https://bpa.st/show/YPVQ

[01:56:14] <djph> (might also have an error about PTY Allocation)
[01:56:25] <kittonian> nope
[01:56:30] <kittonian> here's the answer
[01:56:48] <kittonian> gitlab's user accounts have nothing to do with the ssh connection, except for the fact that it uses the ssh key
[01:56:54] <kittonian> you apparently never connect as your own user
[01:57:00] <kittonian> you connect as git@git.domain.com
[01:57:03] <djph> kittonian: correct.

[01:59:30] <djph> kittonian: anyway -- do you have multiple SSH Keys on your dev machine?
[01:59:33] <kittonian> yes it does but it never says that's the only user to connect as. i thought they were just saying git@ as an example user

[02:01:06] <J_Darnley> Is it possible to make pthreads create new threads with a different niceness through the attributes using the default scheduler?  Or not?  I can't find a definitive answer.
[02:01:06] <djph> kittonian: okay, if you have multiple keys (which you don't today -- but it can happen) ... "git COMMAND" tries with whatever the first key it finds is.  So you'll probably want to set up a "host" configuration in your .ssh/config file for gitlab, so that you can tell it "always use this key"

[02:24:19] <Kadigan_> So I'm trying to send AT commands to send/receive SMS through a Huawei E173. I managed to get it down to 12d1:1001 which indicates it's in serial mode, or so I've been told (reporting as E161/169/620/800 HSDPA), and I've achieved this by using usb_modeswitch, switching to the high-speed modem, and issuing "AT^U2DIAG=0" so that it switches into this mode. The problem I have is that it still seems to be in some superspeed mode because I get very erratic
[02:24:19] <Kadigan_> behaviour (I type in "AT" and get a near-infinite set of back-and-forth, as if it's reacting to partial data).

[03:10:08] <uwharrie> I read an interesting article the other day about compiz vs gnome, and how the former was all about trying new things and letting users experiment and the latter is about following industry fashion and ripping things out in the name of normies/grandmas

[03:11:25] <phogg> The GNOME design team is opinionated and thinks they have all the answers. In that way the GNOME experience is increasingly replicating the MacOS experience: there's only one way, you just need to get on board with it.
[03:11:50] <bparker> like not having tray icons
[03:11:57] <phogg> "It's better that way"
[03:12:00] <phogg> a common refrain
[03:12:13] <nomagno> I'd argue MacOS is far more sane than GNOME. Which is not impressive, but still
[03:12:18] <phogg> the other one I like is "This decision was made months ago, you should have put in your objection before it was finalized."
[03:12:26] <dre> ^^^
[03:12:29] <dre> holy crap
[03:12:42] <bparker> however, phogg and zippyy... if any linux distro ever wants to get anywhere on the desktop, they ARE going to have to widdle down some of the massive amount of choices so easily available
[03:12:46] <bparker> IMO
[03:12:57] <phogg> in other words "if you want to stop us from breaking things you need to live on the GNOME design mailing list" it very much reminds me of Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy "the plans have been on display in the planning office for the last nine months..."
[03:13:01] <zippyy> i agree

[03:15:09] <bparker> dre: I mean unless they have LTS branches, I can understand only having the capacity to focus on the newest thing
[03:15:11] <nomagno> GNOME OS is SPECIFICALLY not a user-oriented distribution

[07:59:05] <ayecee> that's kind of what iso means.
[07:59:14] <labrador> Ok fine its a disk image ayecee,but it still has a .iso extension

[08:38:16] <jim> what's project libre
[08:38:19] <ayecee> why
[08:38:48] <labrador> When a UEFI system boots, it first looks for the EFI System Partition. The disk containing the system partition must have a GUID Partition Table (GPT), and the system partition is recognized by its fixed GUID. The system partition should be a FAT32 partition from which the firmware reads and executes the boot loader.
[08:38:58] <labrador> I think ayecee you need a partition
[08:39:33] <ayecee> well you say that but how does it boot from a cd/dvd then
[08:39:47] <ayecee> i think there's more to the story than that

[08:42:24] <ayecee> the windows iso doesn't though
[08:42:26] <labrador> ayecee, I think it is. A bios system will read the mbr boot partition which is 512 bytes long,goes into another stage where code stored b/w partition table and first partition then reads bootloader from /boot directory

[13:51:17] <ayecee> moha: it says right at the top of the page
[13:51:34] <hexnewbie> starfarer: Well, zooming is the only one I use. It works in Nautilus and Goldendict, not in Firefox.
[13:51:48] <ayecee> moha: the replacement is another mfa system that is significantly more complete and flexible.
[13:52:45] <moha> ayecee: what would you suggest to have 2FA in an organization? It seems the LinOTP has been discontinued!
[13:52:46] <hexnewbie> starfarer: Oh, no. Sorry. Zooming does not work in Firefox, but the one I'm missing is scrolling. Which is annoyingly a different gesture in goldendict and nautilus, but atleast it exists. Whereas in Firefox, I have to drag the scrollbar :D

[15:35:58] <stanrifkin> BUGS
[15:35:58] <stanrifkin>        According to POSIX, the nice value is a per-process setting.  However, under  the  current
[15:35:58] <stanrifkin>        Linux/NPTL implementation of POSIX threads, the nice value is a per-thread attribute: dif‐
[15:35:58] <stanrifkin>        ferent threads in the same process can have different nice values.  Portable  applications should  avoid relying on the Linux behavior, which may be made standards conformant in the future.

[15:37:51] <J_Darnley> I can set the niceness of a thread after creating just fine with nice().  That isn't a problem.  And yes that is with the default scheduler.

[15:38:20] <koollman> stanrifkin: well, yes
[15:39:01] <J_Darnley> But I have a library that I want to use that wraps the thread creation.  I can provide it a pthread_attr_t object though.
[15:39:29] <koollman> but posix threads *do* provide pthread_attr_setschedparam, with a priority (which is per thread). It can be used or ignored. it probably should be used with explicit scheduling rather than inheriting scheduling, though
[15:39:32] *** Parts: Pddy (~Pddy@user/SmplyPddy) (bye)
[15:40:33] <koollman> if you want it portable, it's the kind of thing you should test on multiple platforms with different posix thread behavior
[15:40:54] <J_Darnley> When I try to call pthread_attr_setschedparam() to set a priority in that struct I get an error returned
[15:40:55] <J_Darnley> "pthread_attr_setschedparam: Invalid argument"
[15:41:11] <koollman> then you may be doing it wrong :)

[15:41:46] <koollman> It is a definite "maybe" :)
[15:42:16] <koollman> on linux, with nptl, I don't think you should do it, so maybe the function protects you from doing it
[15:43:13] <koollman> (and my manpage says you should use pthread_attr_setinheritsched to set PTHREAD_EXPLICIT_SCHED rather than inherit scheduler, to use the priority)

[17:22:49] <t4nk_freenode> I switched to kernel 5.16 the other day, ryzen2700x, rx580. I've been having problems left&right, really the first time ever that I'm facing problems with newer kernels. while compiling in the background, there's an enormous performance degradation on my kde desktop, stuttering video, lagging windows( I never experienced this before, ever, at least not since my 2700x and 32G). Furthermore I experienced segfaults during compiling, other inconsistencies which
[17:22:50] <t4nk_freenode> led me to think that I'm having issues with my mem, like when overclocking too much
[17:23:13] <t4nk_freenode> but I switched backl to 5.15.10, and the strangeness disappeared

[18:34:01] <t4nk_freenode> zetaE, very strange... I ran through Qsynth now, flipflopped some settings.... chose ALSA for the audio driver, that changed things for the better though there was an ever so slight crack in the background, enough to unnerve me. then I added a soundfont, flipflopped some more.. and now everything seems 'ok', and the ALSA setting has been reverted to pulseaudio( without my doing)
[18:34:11] <gh555222> and then call an RPC interface from the linux host through to the guest, a distant from ideal solution however
[18:34:14] <acresearch> cisco87: i am usually only interested in computation power (RAM, CPUs, GPUs) only    so i never went into these complicated server building techneaques

[23:24:52] <rbox> it also claims there are 8.5gb of extra bytes at the beginning... which seems odd

[23:37:21] <AssKoala> rustytaco, I roll my eyes at statements like that :P
