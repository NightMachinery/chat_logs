[01:09:07] <wroathe> quesker: Well, let's break that one down for a sec. $('input[type=radio][name=years]').change(... has two parts. $(...) selects a collection of elements from the page using a CSS selector, and .change(...) iterates through that collection binding the provided listener. querySelectorAll does the same kind of thing as $(...) with a selector, and returns an object of type NodeList, and NodeList has
[01:09:13] <wroathe> forEach defined: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/NodeList/forEach, and so one approach would just be document.querySelectorAll('input[type=radio][name=years]').forEach(e => e.addEventListener(...)); where ... is your handler
[01:10:22] <wroathe> quesker: But we can build up our own abstractions and, for example, you could simplify that a bit by using that "on" function I defined earlier to document.querySelectorAll(...).forEach(e => on(e, 'change', ...));
[01:10:28] <earendel> not exactly. jquery wraps the target in some jquerythingish object
[01:11:16] <earendel> w/ d.querySelectorAll you would need that foreach step
[01:11:30] <earendel> as pendulm proposed
[01:12:14] <earendel> okay. this is what u said. right.
[01:12:33] <wroathe> quesker: Or you could modify that "on" function we defined earlier to handle objects with forEach defined: https://gist.github.com/JustinChristensen/652bedadc92cf0aff86cc5fbcde87732#file-on-js-L6-L10
[01:12:44] <wroathe> earendel: ;)
[01:13:41] <wroathe> quesker: So now with that new definition we could just do on(document.querySelectorAll('...'), 'change', e => ...);
[01:15:41] <Slade> so i've got a fun one. i was looking at a video on imgur.. i've got it opened, so i can play it.. but its been deleted off the server. so i cant save it.
[01:15:59] <quesker> testing all the suggstions thanks
[01:17:06] <earendel> slade: i think chrome would save it from cache even. but yeah.
[01:17:27] *** Joins: summersault (~summersau@179.221.251.16)
[01:18:10] <Slade> earendel, no it replaces it with the latested, which is just a redirect to 'removed'
[01:19:22] <Slade> if i try to save it without being connected to the internet. i get a 'network error'
[01:19:39] <earendel> well..not sure if it was chromium or firefox. i thnk chromium though, which unless forced, would make use of cached version .. even for download.
[01:19:55] <earendel> which is also what i'd expect.
[01:20:10] <earendel> i noticed, because my bandwith sucks.
[01:20:19] <wroathe> quesker: I just updated that gist again to make "on" treat a string like a selector, so that you could do on('input[type=radio][name=years]', 'change', e => ...);
[01:20:55] <wroathe> quesker: Like 6 lines of Javascript replaces a huge portion of what people like about that $().foo thing

[01:58:43] <wroathe> quesker: So you can conditionally style it based on it's checkedness
[01:58:49] <gkatsev> a checkbox input has a `checked` attribute and a css pseudo-selector for selecting it too

[01:59:50] <quesker> well I know it is checked because I am in the handler, it sends ajax when checked.  but this is for styling, bootstrap makes it a different color

[02:32:32] <wroathe> cthulchu: You don't need to limit yourself to ES5 to support legacy browsers. Babel and a collection of polyfills like core-js will let you write modern Javascript and it will translate it into ES5 for you.
[02:32:54] <wroathe> cthulchu: And this isn't an edge case or something to make a big deal about. It's pretty much the standard for how people write JS for the browser these days.

[02:33:10] <ashnur> old browsers suck even more than new browsers
[02:33:13] <cthulchu> I'm not able to use polyfills, but using babel just for ES6 is... meh

[02:33:54] <ashnur> maybe because they are big :D
[02:34:31] <wroathe> ashnur: Not necessarily. Babel can include polysfills you actualy use individually.

[02:45:20] <wroathe> cthulchu: I'd encourage you to not dismiss transpilation wholesale until you've done some more research on it. Whether or not GTM uses ES6 Javascript should have no impact on whether or not you use Babel to transpile modern Javascript to ES5

[09:07:04] <doc|home> so I learned js way back before even jquery was a thing and now I'm trying to brush up on my fundamentals as they've changed a lot and I've been a bit more back end focused. This has me confused though. I'm not sure if it's badly worded or I'm being dense, but https://eloquentjavascript.net/06_object.html is breaking my brain a bit. The paragraph after "speak.call(hungryRabbit, "Burp!");"
[09:07:38] <doc|home> it reads "Since each function has its own this binding, whose value depends on the way it is called, you cannot refer to the this of the wrapping scope in a regular function defined with the function keyword." but isn't that what they've just done in the previous function definition? What am I missing?
[09:10:12] *** Joins: comatory (~ondrejsyn@217.11.241.69)
[09:10:13] <wroathe> doc|home: They're saying that the `this` inside of a function defined with the function keyword _shadows_ the `this` from the outer scope
[09:10:29] <wroathe> doc|home: contrasted with arrow functions, which they explain in the paragraph below that
[09:11:52] <doc|home> is it just me being dense or is it worded badly/could have clearer examples?

[09:12:52] <doc|home> ok, thanks for the explanation
[09:13:48] <wroathe> doc|home: https://jsfiddle.net/psw523nv/
[09:13:50] <wroathe> doc|home: Here's an example
[09:14:33] <wroathe> doc|home: Notice that in the first test an arrow function can't have it's own `this` binding, and so trying to bind it with .call does nothing (except for call the function, but, again, without `this`)
[09:15:00] <wroathe> doc|home: And because it can't have it's own `this` binding it refers to the `this` from the outer scope (and prints hello twice because of that)
[09:15:23] <wroathe> doc|home: contrasted with the below which prints out "hello" and "world"

[09:15:33] <wroathe> doc|home: get it, got it, good?
[09:15:43] * doc|home still parsing :)
[09:18:44] <doc|home> can I be a dick and ask for a version that's not wrapped in ().call(x)? That's messing with my head a bit.
[09:19:02] <wroathe> doc|home: I can give you half of that. The .call is important.
[09:19:07] <wroathe> doc|home: One sec
[09:19:28] <doc|home> I know it's a short hand way of defining and running a function but the format is new to me, I've never used it, and it's throwing me off just because I'm not there yet in my head
[09:20:47] <wroathe> doc|home: https://jsfiddle.net/psw523nv/1/
[09:21:10] <doc|home> I actually get that there's essentially no inherent in an arrow function, it uses it from the parent, just their description threw me through a loop so I'm trying to make sense of it
[09:21:13] <doc|home> thanks!
[09:21:21] <doc|home> *inherent this

[11:25:45] <doc> Jck_true: ok, cool, no deadline then. Considered something like react for it?

[11:26:08] *** Joins: xse (~xse@user/xse)
[11:26:49] <Jck_true> Well... Sure? I don't really mind one or the other... It would be nice though if I could embed it in my current website though
[11:26:59] <doc> yep, react can do that
[11:27:01] <Jck_true> (Which is a static generated website using Hugo)
[11:27:25] <doc> er, ok, someone else will have to comment on that
[11:28:02] <doc> I think it should be possible
[11:28:31] <Jck_true> So React as the "full" workflow?
[11:29:06] *** Quits: straykitten (~straykitt@subs25-116-206-9-59.three.co.id) (Ping timeout: 264 seconds)
[11:29:13] <doc> yep, you can create a component and then add it to your site.
[11:29:22] <Jck_true> I'll have a look at the book. :)
[11:29:59] <doc> by the way, eloquent js is to react what phptherightway would be to laravel
[11:30:32] * doc hasn't read php the right way or used laravel since version 1, but I think that should be a fair evaluation. eloquent js won't cover react as far as I know
[11:30:53] <vartan> Are you referring to the book on the JS language? It's not a textbook on React.
[11:30:59] <Jck_true> Well I need an overview first I think.
[11:31:00] <doc> yep
[11:31:10] <doc> Jck_true: yeah, then eloquent js is good for that
[11:31:14] <vartan> Jck_true: Will you have a separate route for the React-driven gallery? In that sense, there's no issue mixing Hugo and React.
[11:32:06] <doc> vartan: doesn't need to be does it?
[11:32:17] <rannnn8888> document.getElementById("ss").innerHTML =
[11:32:18] <rannnn8888>   (100 * {{ entry.167 }} / {{ entry.154 }}).toFixed(2) + "%"
[11:32:18] <doc> can just be a component on a page that's not otherwise react
[11:32:30] <rannnn8888> its possible fix this by this way ?
[11:32:34] <Jck_true> vartan: In the end I hope to have a javascript function that I can just call S3Gallery(bucket_name); and it would render .... "something"
[11:33:01] <Jck_true> vartan: But I'm pretty flexible on that side...
[11:33:06] <doc> Jck_true: it'd be like a html tag you add to a page https://reactjs.org/docs/add-react-to-a-website.html
[11:33:21] <vartan> doc: True. I haven't touched Hugo in a while, so I'm hoping it's not too difficult to integrate it. It's just a small library you add to the page -- don't even need to use React for the whole DOM.
[11:33:29] <Jck_true> Neat!
[11:33:30] * doc nods
[11:34:10] <vartan> Sorry I missed the greater context here. Why are we adding React to the page anyway? Something about a photo gallery?
[11:34:16] <doc> most people don't use it as a component on the page, they use it as the basis for an entire site, but it is possible.
[11:34:16] <rannnn8888> can help me here fix this ? https://dpaste.org/unDo
[11:34:31] <doc> vartan: because it's a gallery he wants to add to an existing page
[11:35:00] <vartan> doc: Got it. So perhaps using a pre-existing component for convenience? To not reinvent the gallery "wheel"? =)
[11:35:01] <doc> rannnn8888: are you getting an error?
[11:35:16] <doc> vartan: well, he is, but that's ok :) it's a learning project

[11:35:48] <rannnn8888> doc i think i cent use the document.getElementById("ss").innerHTML = ?
[11:35:55] <rannnn8888> yes get err
[11:36:04] <vartan> Jck_true: Oh yeah. Anything that's going to be linked or dependent on some source of data is made much more convenient by way of modern frontend frameworks. Well worth the effort to learn them.
[11:36:05] <Jck_true> vartan: Have a bunch of PDF manuals I want to share also. Put them in a bucket and have the UI "auto generated"
[11:36:32] <vartan> rannnn8888: Did you check whether the element is selected successfully?
[11:36:39] <rannnn8888> doc sorry i think its work secc
[11:36:45] <doc> Jck_true: you'll find this useful I think: https://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/

[11:38:03] <vartan> You could potentially put the PDF in a frame, by the way. Browsers display PDFs natively now.
[11:38:28] <Jck_true> Something similar to what Gmail does when attachments

[16:06:14] <shan> systemfault: i too looked for it in math
[16:06:22] <systemfault> But I must know ALL_THE_THINGS!
[16:06:28] <stennowork> to be fair it probably belongs to Number and not Math
[16:06:28] <systemfault> Feels bad man...
[16:06:34] <shan> i was reasonably certain it was called epsilon, even, it just didn't strike me it would be in Number
[16:06:42] <shan> stennowork: epsilon feels like a math word
[16:06:43] <entuland> float comparison... eheheh, fun stuff
[16:06:47] <stennowork> The Number.EPSILON property represents the difference between 1 and the smallest floating point number greater than 1.
[16:07:04] <stennowork> shan, sure but this goes in line with MAX_SAFE_INTEGER and stuff which also belongs to Number
[16:07:24] <stennowork> its more of an IEEE 754 thing than an actual math thing

[20:58:03] <wroathe> So as I'm digging into React hooks a bit more here and playing around with them in a sample application I'm thinking back to what I did back in 2018 setting up a React/Redux application for my team and establishing the development patterns. Back then hooks weren't a thing, and we relied on mapStateToProps and mapDispatchToProps to connect our store to our components. I really liked that pattern,
[20:58:09] <wroathe> because it let me build components that were truly a function of their input (by injecting everything into props), and made testing and implementation trivial. The hooks-based useSelector and useDispatch approach, on the other hand, seems inferior compared to that. I _could_ create a higher order component that uses the hooks API to reimplement something like mapStateToProps, but then I've gone full
[20:58:15] <wroathe> circle back to the 2018 approach. Am I right in thinking that hooks are actually a step backwards here for functional components?
[20:59:03] *** Joins: kakashiAL3 (~kakashi@ip-37-201-199-1.hsi13.unitymediagroup.de)
[20:59:32] <wroathe> It seems like a middle ground between stateful class-based components and actually functional components designed to trick OOPers into accepting the new world order, but ultimately a distraction from building actually functional components
[21:01:47] <ljharb> i agree with that take. i think hooks are an awkward desperation move to try to get rid of class components

[21:07:14] <Rockwood> https://codesandbox.io/s/sm1zv like this
[21:07:23] <wroathe> Granted, we had to set up props to override state in mapStateToProps. I could do similiar with useSelector, or even make my own hook that that takes a store selector and a props selector and gives the prop priority
[21:07:51] <wroathe> And that would give me a bit of reusability, but ultimately I'd still want to wrap this in a higher order component for re-use

[21:14:47] <samsch> wroathe, HoCs and render props components remain pretty much the best way to really separate logic with React.
[21:15:03] <Rockwood> GreenJello, https://gist.github.com/Cyberiaaxis/c928e3e332938c6025f826b647b853db still the menuitems not showing
[21:15:08] <l__q> why in class in jsx, when I make an if without else and the condition is not fulfilled, it adds "false" to the class, only in class there is such a problem: className={`votes ${select === vote && `selected`}`}
[21:15:14] *** fkm_ is now known as fkm
[21:15:21] <l__q> my solution to the problem is to add else, but why do I have to do it so it that doesn't add false to the class?  className={`votes ${select === vote ? `selected` : ""}`}
[21:16:08] <samsch> I do think hooks and function components are more suitable, since they discourage a lot of foolish stuff you could easily do with classes.
[21:16:22] <wroathe> samsch: That's kind of my impression at the moment, but I'm thinking through the implications of just implementing this as a general hook that lets me select state into an object to merge with props, similiar to what I was doing with mapStateToProps
[21:16:33] <samsch> But hooks have serious problems in what they require you to know and can't be intuited.
[21:16:35] <wroathe> samsch: It just needs to function the same. I suppose it doesn't matter if it's a HoC or a hook.
[21:17:47] <wroathe> samsch: The goal is just to allow for props to override state props. In practice the state will always come from the store, but for testing and completeness it's nice to have props override the store state.

[21:18:29] <wroathe> But HoCs, in theory, are still a more elegant way to reuse logic like this

[21:19:50] <samsch> IMO, the main problem with HoCs is really just some write and read inconveniences
[21:20:04] <samsch> Hooks do mostly solve that issue
[21:20:06] <wroathe> I suppose people were complaining about wrapping displayName, and how that looked in the React devtools. It kind of seems like they should've just added another static component property, like Component.hocStack = [];, and then made the React dev tools only display the displayName by default, but list hte hocStack on mouseover in a popup or something like that
[21:20:23] <wroathe> samsch: can you elaborate?

[21:25:51] <wroathe> samsch: The hook may not require that level of indirection, but that goes to what I was saying about code re-use.
[21:26:12] <wroathe> samsch: It's like arguing that it would be better for function bodies to just replace function calls, because then you wouldn't need to track down a function and find out what it does.
[21:26:26] <samsch> Well, in the first HoC example, if the body is long, then you can miss the HoC info until you hit the bottom of the file. For the second, the code is clumsy and hard to read/write.

[21:52:09] <samsch> useEffect is the worst part of the hooks. It's hard to understand, and easy to use incorrectly.
[21:52:37] <ljharb> velix: it's just vscode but you have to build it yourself, and it doesn't tell microsoft when things crash, so it can't be made better

[21:56:19] <samsch> peteyboy1, I'd love to have an easy way to show you the #reactjs logs for the year after hooks came out. useEffect confusion was like 50% of the cause for questions.
[21:56:24] <samsch> Maybe more
[21:56:27] <wroathe> doc: Without some sort of stateful mechanism for deciding when to run an effect it will run on every render. useEffect has a mechanism for preventing this by performing equality checks on effect dependencies, but this will always be tricky and prone to error
[21:57:07] *** Joins: BinaryUnit (~glitch@user/binaryunit)
[21:57:09] <wroathe> doc: But you can skip all of that confusion and pain by just recognizing that the effect you're trying to perform should be happening as part of event handling anyway, and not tied to rendering your components.
[21:57:14] <peteyboy1> samsch, either i haven't used it for the same things as the people with the questions, or most of them are plain dumb. i have no idea. i myself found them super easy and intuitive
[21:57:20] <doc> yeah, the dependencies array setup is... annoying, maybe they replace that eventually because it does seem to cause problems
[21:57:41] <doc> peteyboy1: what was your question? I can't see it
[21:57:42] <samsch> peteyboy1, You might have a functional or reactive programming basic mindset or something.
[21:57:56] <peteyboy1> doc, it's this: could someone help me clear the select club field when the country changes? https://codesandbox.io/s/elegant-khorana-t2mik?file=/src/App.js
[21:58:00] <samsch> But trust me, lots of people really don't get it quickly or easily.
[21:58:30] <ljharb> velix: yes, it's identical
[21:58:43] <ljharb> velix: real vscode is just a build of vscodium with a different settings file
[21:58:47] <wroathe> doc: For example, often times what you're really trying to do is perform some sort of effect on route change, or on initial page load, rather than whne a specific part of your UI gets rendered.
[21:58:56] <ljharb> velix: imo it's a waste of time to bother with vscodium, just use vscode
[21:59:04] <peteyboy1> samsch, i mean, maybe it's that i don't really get it. but i find it unlikely, since it worked as expected every time, and with hundreds of useeffects written it's statistically highly unlikely that it worked out of pure luck haha

[22:03:05] <wroathe> doc: Although with much better abstractions than your typical MVC style setup
[22:03:39] <samsch> wroathe, Consider a component which takes an ID prop and loads some info about that ID. The parent controls the ID and has the state handling for when it changes, but doesn't know anything about the data loading that the child does. If you move the "on ID change" logic to the parent, you've mixed concerned.
[22:03:41] <wroathe> doc: We've gone through the fire and flames and realized that functional reactive problem solving is much better, and that managing effects is _key_ for writing correct software
[22:04:01] <doc> wroathe: sounds like a potential library really
[22:04:22] <wroathe> doc: Not really. It's just about the discipline of managing effects.

[22:04:55] <velix> ;)
[22:04:56] <doc> wroathe: sure, but I'm not sure react router is a nice enough API for people to really want to do that
[22:04:59] <peteyboy1> samsch, purely curiosity, does what you describe have any side effects (no pun intended) on anything or is the only complaint because it's against some clean code practice or something?
[22:05:04] <wroathe> samsch: Yes, this will violate encapsulation, but the argument here is that encapsulation isn't nearly as important as we think it is in the component layer.
[22:05:16] <peteyboy1> no pun intended = didn't mean it in a useEffect kind of way

[22:09:15] <peteyboy1> doc, yes. so you select a country. you get the list of clubs to choose from. you choose a club. but if you go straigh to select another country i want the club input to be empty, for no club to be selected, as it was when you first got to the page

[22:15:48] <doc> maybe not empty string, maybe null
[22:15:56] <peteyboy1> but it doesn't work, since it's not the "club" useState that decides whether the club input is empty or not
[22:16:10] <doc> we're kind of getting into the weeds on autocomplete which I haven't used without react hook forms so your case is different to mine
[22:16:39] <doc> peteyboy1: https://material-ui.com/api/autocomplete/ can "value" be used to set the state?
[22:17:19] <doc> as in to clear the selected option on country change
[22:17:22] <wroathe> This is a pretty militaristic approach, but I think it's possible, and maybe even desirable, that we look at our UI as a set of classes of "pure" and "impure" functions. Using something like Redux and React we've got a mechanism for establishing purely functional components that construct a DOM tree as a function of it's input data (through props), and a mechanism for establishing pure functions to
[22:17:28] <wroathe> update the model for our components (through reducers on a store), and then we can constrain our effects to just event handlers, which become the only class of "impure" or "effectful" functions. The benefits to doing this are many, but one key one that comes to mind is that testing the view and testing the model become trivial, and the event handlers act as a sort of "controller" that require slightly
[22:17:34] <wroathe> more involved testing strategies to set up environmental preconditions.
[22:18:03] <wroathe> So basically I'm advocating for minimizing the role of React, but still treating it like a vital part of the architecture
[22:18:23] <doc> wroathe: sure, but libraries don't really work that way to support that. For example, apollo graphql queries are intended to be hooks within components :/
[22:19:02] <wroathe> doc: Indeed. I'm big on taking a theoretical or idealistic look at a problem, to help understand where we're making concessions along the way for real world considerations.
[22:19:02] <doc> hooks or other means of querying that is
[22:19:09] <samsch> wroathe, Honestly might make sense to ditch React though, and move to the one of the smaller and faster libraries. Inferno, Preact.

[22:19:34] <peteyboy1> doc, how haven't i heard of react hook forms. does it have an autocomplete and all that jazz?
[22:19:38] <samsch> React has really started taken the framework approach, and I don't think it's good.
[22:19:43] <wroathe> doc: Theoertically I'd prefer to build my applications in the way I've just described, but it's not always possible under time constraints to build everything from scratch, and sometimes you need to settle for "good enough" and note it down as a place where you veered away from your goal
[22:20:04] <doc> peteyboy1: it's not a replacement for material ui, it's more a way of interacting with forms, so it might not help you, also it's... a bit messy

[22:42:44] <peteyboy1> also samsch, doc, when you use a framework like mui or antd do you just take what you need, say modal and autocomplete, or do you take from them every single thing that you need? i don't see a lot of sense taking it's grid or whatever instead of the css one
[22:43:05] <peteyboy1> samsch, i'm pretty positive they all work as they should, well, at least bootstrap and mui
[22:43:14] <samsch> When I'm the one making those decisions, I don't use the kits at all.
[22:43:25] *** Joins: amahl (~amahl@dsl-jklbng12-54fbca-64.dhcp.inet.fi)
[22:43:32] <peteyboy1> as you might expect me to ask, so what do you do when you need an autocomplete? :)
[22:43:36] <doc> peteyboy1: varies, depending on the effect I want. You will find they generally become pretty pervasive but I try to minimise where possible because you may at some point want to swap them out
[22:43:52] <samsch> I use standalone components, like downshift or react-select.
[22:44:15] <samsch> I strongly prefer standalone components with minimal or no styles.
[22:44:27] <peteyboy1> samsch, and you manage to style it and behave like the neighbouring inputs?
[22:44:34] <samsch> But I'll also use components from unstyled things like reakit
[22:44:46] <peteyboy1> is it hard to customize antd's style?
[22:45:40] <samsch> The base input is the only part that needs to act like other inputs, and it's usually not hard to make those styles match.
[22:46:04] <peteyboy1> the base input?

[22:46:14] <peteyboy1> what about the dropdown and everything in it?
[22:46:18] <samsch> I've taken to preferring to avoid a dropdown combobox/autocomplete at all if I can help it though.
[22:46:22] <peteyboy1> the dropdown of the autocomplete that is
[22:47:39] *** Joins: wroathe (~wroathe@c-68-54-25-135.hsd1.mn.comcast.net)
[22:47:42] <samsch> I'm not sure if I've actually personally styled a dropdown the whole way. Maybe once a while ago. The projects I'm on usually have the less senior people doing the styles thb.
[22:48:26] <samsch> It doesn't seem like a particularly hard task to style. The correct accessible behavior part is much harder.
[22:48:57] <samsch> I do use pre-built styles, even like Bootstrap css when I'm throwing stuff together.
[22:49:14] <samsch> There's often some pre-existing css that can be tweaked to work.
[22:49:18] <peteyboy1> maybe i suck at styling if i struggle with react-select so much
[22:49:46] <samsch> Well, react-select is kinda a turd. Styling *it* being hard doesn't mean styling a dropdown is hard.
[22:50:20] <peteyboy1> samsch, yeah i meant styling the dropdown of an autocomplete of react-select, mui, or whatever
[22:50:29] <peteyboy1> or antd

[22:53:43] <doc> that's why I used frameworks. Styling native inputs is annoying.
[22:54:14] <stenno> i don't even use the different input types even though they would be semantically better sometimes
[22:54:21] <peteyboy1> yeah antd doesn't look too bad, and it's not seen everywhere like mui
[22:54:31] <stenno> because every browser has their own UA styles and functionality to it
[22:55:42] <ljharb> sometimes that's ideal
[22:55:50] <ljharb> but some of the input types have really crappy UIs in some browsers

[22:57:12] <peteyboy1> anyway, i'm glad i have discovered antd, it's more minimalistic than mui and seems to have even more components than mui. just left to see how it plays out in practice
[22:57:20] <samsch> I kinda like the native styles myself

[23:40:15] <qswz> if it was an egg, then it's not the first chicken
[23:40:31] <GreenJello> qswz, the egg was laid by a non-chicken
[23:40:41] <qswz> bah, honestly, I see evolution (of species) as almost continuous process

[23:41:24] <qswz> right, sometimes some little bumps
[23:41:27] <GreenJello> it has common ancestors
[23:41:58] <qswz> I think before being eggs as we know

[23:42:21] <qswz> etc.. that's more the way I see the evolutioon

[23:56:08] <qswz> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perpetual_motion#/media/File:Overbalanced_wheel.svg
[23:57:38] <ljharb> qswz: it's called "an insufficiently specified question, that is obvious once specified"
[23:58:19] <ljharb> qswz: eg, "egg" implies "chicken egg", but is a "chicken egg" one a chicken lays, or one a chicken hatches from? if the former, a chicken must have come first, if the latter, the chicken egg must have come first. it's not a paradox at all.
