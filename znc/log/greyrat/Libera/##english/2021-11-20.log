[03:20:56] <LjL> Hazey_Dream, i am going by feeling here because i don't really know the silly little "rules" for adjectives (nevermind getting into how "loud" works there), but the order you gave sounds the best to my ears, and i'd say "bright, loud, simple" would come second best, but i would not start with "simple"
[03:21:03] <LuisP14> order does matter
[03:22:56] <LjL> LuisP14, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rRBLegvo5w
[03:23:36] <Hazey_Dream> Yeah, supposedly, there is an adjective order. https://dictionary.cambridge.org/grammar/british-grammar/adjectives-order
[03:23:39] <Hazey_Dream> Opinion, size, physical quality, shape, age, colour, origin, material, type, purpose
[03:23:49] <Hazey_Dream> So which adjective in mine is which?
[03:24:27] <Hazey_Dream> "Loud" here, meaning (of clothing, decorations, etc.) Having unpleasantly and tastelessly contrasting colours or patterns; gaudy. a loud style of dress;  loud colors
[03:27:49] <LjL> the problem is that rules like that are attempts to give an "order" (as in, a logic) that we can understand in words and reasoning to what is essentially "just what people say". by that i do not mean that there *is no* order intrinsic to what people say, but our rules are only an approximation of it
[03:28:24] <Hazey_Dream> Ah. So it's a rough guideline, not strict rules.
[03:28:48] <LjL> it's neither a guideline nor can it possibly be "strict"
[03:28:51] <LjL> language doesn't work like that
[03:28:54] <LjL> it's a description
[03:28:58] <LjL> or an attempt at one
[03:29:27] <bbbbb> loud and bright are physical qualities, simple is a type of colour....so it works there as I agree 'simple' should come last
[03:30:23] <LjL> as i was repeating it in my head, i said "brout, lide, simple colors"
[03:30:30] <Hazey_Dream> Loud in the sense that it has unpleasantly/tastelessly contrasting colours, or is gaudy, is a physical colours?
[03:30:33] <Hazey_Dream> Also, lol LjL.
[03:30:44] <Hazey_Dream> Erm. Sorry.
[03:30:50] <bbbbb> Unless you said I like simple colours which are loud and bright
[03:30:50] <Hazey_Dream> Loud in the sense that it has unpleasantly/tastelessly contrasting colours, or is gaudy, is a physical quality?
[03:32:23] <bbbbb> hrm, I guess that could be an opinion then
[03:34:00] <Hazey_Dream> So it's loud, & then which of bright or simple? I guess bright since that refers to how light they are, & thus, how much light travels into the eye when perceiving the colour, making "bright" a physical quality?
[03:34:44] <bbbbb> I'd agree bright is a physical quality

[10:35:10] <LuisP14> i guess
[10:35:12] <bullgard4> What is the difference between _scholarly_ and _scientific_ work as in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Latin?
[10:35:47] <Belamos> LuisP14, an example that I just cooked up - could be total nonsense
[10:35:50] <Belamos> "Whenever will your brother arrive?"
[10:35:54] <Belamos> is that valid?
[10:36:03] <CuriosTiger> Yes, but not very common.
[10:36:24] <CuriosTiger> "When will your brother arrive?" would be the usual way of asking that question.
[10:36:44] <CuriosTiger> "Whenever" has connotations of exasperation. "Whenever will your brother arrive? He was supposed to be here three hours ago!"
[10:37:18] <Belamos> CuriosTiger, so, if I wanted to complain about his brother being late,  I could say "Whenever" ?
[10:37:41] <CuriosTiger> You could. That's not the most common use of "whenever", but it is a valid one.
[10:38:07] <Belamos> CuriosTiger, that's why I wondered about it... I heard similar sentences in movies twice in the past couple of months
[10:38:13] <Belamos> so I wondered, what was going on there
[10:38:16] <CuriosTiger> The most common use is something like: "When do you want to go shopping? Whenever you want."
[10:38:18] <Belamos> CuriosTiger, are you a native English speaker?
[10:38:28] <CuriosTiger> Native, no. Fluent, yes.
[10:38:35] <Belamos> CuriosTiger, yes, that's how I would see it as well (answer to your example above)

[10:43:52] <CuriosTiger> LuisP14: Whatever!
[10:43:54] <CuriosTiger> :P
[10:44:09] <LuisP14> :3
[10:44:31] <CuriosTiger> Belamos: https://dictionary.cambridge.org/grammar/british-grammar/however-whatever-whichever-whenever-wherever-whoever has a good overview.
[10:45:03] <bullgard4> What is the difference between _scholarly_ and _scientific_ work as in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Latin?
[10:45:08] <Belamos> why, thank you, CuriosTiger 
[10:45:35] <Belamos> LuisP14, why "...so..." in "whensoever" ?
[10:46:23] <bullgard4> Belamos, this is to emphasisze the uncertainty
[10:46:29] <LuisP14> they can have a so in between, which gives them more emphasis
[10:47:11] <CuriosTiger> bullgard4: scholarly work is typically done under the auspices of some institution of higher learning, like a university. Scientific work doesn't have to be.
[10:47:11] <CuriosTiger> but there's certainly a lot of overlap between the two categories.
[10:47:19] <CuriosTiger> I'd also argue that it's possible to do scholarly work that is not scientific, but you probably wouldn't use "new Latin" in those instances.
[10:47:45] <bullgard4> CuriosTiger, I see. - Thank you.
[10:47:46] <Belamos> bullgard4, can I do this also with other question words?
[10:47:57] <Belamos> bullgard4, whatsoever,  whosoever ?
[10:48:04] <LuisP14> yea
[10:48:08] <CuriosTiger> Belamos: You can, yes.
[10:48:15] <bullgard4> Belamos, To a certain degree, yws.
[10:48:21] <bullgard4> yes
[10:48:35] <CuriosTiger> Whatsoever is by far the most common such combination.
[10:48:43] <pussipupu> I'm not sure I've ever encountered “whensoever”
[10:48:50] <pussipupu> And I might instinctively tag it a hypercorrection
[10:48:56] <CuriosTiger> I have, but I'm pretty sure it was in the King James Bible.
[10:49:06] <CuriosTiger> ie. pretty archaic language.
[10:49:20] <Belamos> oh, yeah, archaic language is the best
[10:49:22] <LuisP14> !d whensoever
[10:49:24] <tinsoldier> whensoever — Adverb: 1. whenever; at any time at all https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/whensoever
[10:49:27] <Belamos> that makes me sound intelligent then ;)
[10:49:28] <CuriosTiger> Whosoever says otherwise must be a heritic!
[10:49:31] <CuriosTiger> *heretic
[10:50:02] <LuisP14> !d whysoever
[10:50:02] <Belamos> heh, heretic... that was in the netflix series about Mary, Queen of Scots where I first learnt that word
[10:50:04] <tinsoldier> whysoever — Adverb: 1. form of whyever https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/whysoever
[10:50:11] <CuriosTiger> Belamos: Archaic language can convey an air of sophistication when used correctly. When used incorrectly, it conveys an air of ignorance.
[10:50:11] <pussipupu> I view the KJV as a hypercorrection, and a particularly egregious one
[10:50:14] <LuisP14> :p
[10:50:22] <CuriosTiger> The most infamous example of which is Ye Olde Shoppe.
[10:50:37] <Belamos> CuriosTiger, care to elaborate?
[10:50:58] <pussipupu> Ye is Þe for one
[10:51:18] <CuriosTiger> Belamos: The word that looks like "ye" in many medieval manuscripts is actually the word "the" written with an oddly shaped thorn character
[10:51:35] <pussipupu> Dutch(?) type sets didn't include a þorn character, so we repurposed the y for its visual similarity
[10:51:52] <CuriosTiger> the one pussipupu cited is the normal thorn character. Apparently, many medieval typesets didn't have that one, so they substituted some Greek letter that looks something like a Y.
[10:52:08] <pussipupu> Is “typeset” normally one word?
[10:52:30] <pussipupu> In that sense, it certainly is as the verb
[10:52:41] <CuriosTiger> I've seen it both ways as a noun.
[10:53:05] <pussipupu> Fair play, I'm not sure how I've seen it but the open compound feels more natural to me
[10:53:19] <CuriosTiger> I would not object to "type sets"
[10:53:22] <pussipupu> Of course my view of natural is often synthetic
[10:54:04] <CuriosTiger> but people who are unaware of this fact will assume the word "ye" -- which existed in Middle English and Early Modern English, but with an entirely different meaning -- is what is intended.
[10:54:25] <CuriosTiger> They will also arbitrarily throw "e" at the end of every word just to make it look "old-fashioned"
[10:54:45] <CuriosTiger> And that is when I say unto them: Ye dumbe idiote
[10:54:58] <LuisP14> lole
[10:55:55] <CuriosTiger> TL;DR: Using archaic words, grammar or phrasing CAN lend an air of sophistication, but it can very easily backfire.
[10:56:03] <LuisP14> heh, this makes me read it as "lowl"
[10:56:21] <pussipupu> The main lesson here is we should have bought our type sets from Icelend
[10:56:23] <CuriosTiger> I have a coworker named Lowell.
[10:56:36] <CuriosTiger> pussipupu: s/lend/land/
[10:56:37] <chat> CuriosTiger thinks pussipupu meant to say: The main lesson here is we should have bought our type sets from Iceland
[10:56:53] <pussipupu> Clearly I need more coffee :þ
[10:57:01] <CuriosTiger> I think I'll have some too.

[10:57:37] <CuriosTiger> I wonder if I'll be able to fly to Norway next month.

[10:58:14] <CuriosTiger> Norway may have one as well.
[10:58:30] <CuriosTiger> I can always get in, but I was hoping I wouldn't have to spend Christmas in quarantine.
[10:58:31] <LuisP14> Norway can you travel now .. i guess
[10:58:54] <CuriosTiger> Norway hasn't reinstituted a lockdown...YET.

[10:59:36] <pussipupu> I can travel both ways freely, but my spouse doesn't have inherent right to travel to the UK, and as you say quarantine
[11:00:00] <CuriosTiger> I can travel both ways freely now too, except for testing requirements in the US and vaccination requirements in Norway

[13:32:27] <vaio> Hello. Sorry for the weird question, but can "gunfire" be applied to "rubber bullet weapon", or does it strictly mean "fired by a gun with real bullets" ?
[13:32:33] *** Joins: ___nick___ (~quassel@cpc68286-cdif17-2-0-cust533.5-1.cable.virginm.net)
[13:33:15] <pussipupu> Rubber bullets are real bullets and fired by real guns
[13:33:29] <pussipupu> So I'm answer to your first question, yes
[13:34:34] <vaio> perhaps i should have provided the context: "two people were wounded by police gunfire"
[13:34:43] <Me-me> vaio: You may be looking for the terms "live fire", "live rounds", and other jargon related to firearms.
[13:35:05] <vaio> Me-me: thanks for the tip
[13:35:06] <Me-me> I don't have a complete list but I know there's actual terms for a lot of it.
[13:35:33] <pussipupu> Rounds having rubber bullets doesn't make them not live rounds
[13:35:41] <twb> You can also kill people with a blank cartridge
[13:35:42] <Me-me> As pussipupu says, it is technically gunfire. But I don't know that it's live rounds.
[13:35:48] <Me-me> I would look it up.
[13:35:51] <pussipupu> It's live rounds
[13:36:14] <pussipupu> Blanks don't have bullets, though as pointed out they can still kill, generally at very short range
[13:36:18] <twb> a "blank" has a sort of paper thing instead of a bullet, and it can kill you if you are close enough when it goes off
[13:36:48] <Me-me> I learned recently that there was a difference between blanks and dummy rounds.
[13:36:49] <twb> the other prop weapon is called something like "simulated fire" which just makes a bang noise but doesn't have any explosive at all
[13:38:30] <pussipupu> “dummy rounds” are just inert objects with the right dimensions and weight pretty much
[13:38:35] <pussipupu> Useful for drilling
[13:38:46] *** Joins: Serpent7776 (~Serpent77@90-156-31-193.internetia.net.pl)
[13:39:04] <pussipupu> As in practicing, not as in boring holes into things, for which live ammo is more useful :þ
[13:39:45] <twb> There's also special rounds used for the blanks in firing squads
[13:39:50] <pussipupu> vaio: Your example is fine, but in practice it would probably be useful to specify that the munitions used were rubber, because that's not what people generally assume by default
[13:40:09] <twb> firing squads have everyone but 1 dude have a fake bullet, but nobody knows who does that actual murder, so diffusion of reponsibility
[13:40:24] <twb> but they noticed the grunts could tell from the different recoil
[13:40:41] <vaio> pussipupu: right, that's why i'm asking if gunfire also applies to something else than "plain" guns ;p
[13:40:56] <twb> vaio: colloquially, absolutely yes.
[13:41:02] <pussipupu> It absolutely includes the kind of weaponry you're talking about
[13:41:10] <twb> vaio: formally/technically... maybe also yes
[13:41:43] <pussipupu> I wonder if I could get a gun licence
[13:42:26] <vaio> okay thanks
[13:42:32] <pussipupu> Though I'm not sure I'd get enough use out of a gun to be worthwhile anyway
[13:43:49] <twb> e.g. "laser gunfire" is probably wrong
[13:44:12] <vaio> :D indeed
[13:44:46] <pussipupu> Yeah, but leaving aside the gun/howitzer distinction anything that fires projectiles counts pretty much
[13:45:11] <pussipupu> In engineering contexts of course that includes electrons and other charged particles, which aren't a large part of warfare yet
[13:46:22] <twb> pussipupu: interestingly, the british still have rifle their main battle tanks
[13:46:27] <twb> s/have//
[13:46:27] <chat> twb meant to say: pussipupu: interestingly, the british still  rifle their main battle tanks
[13:47:01] <pussipupu> Yeah, I've not looked into it enough to have an opinion on the worth of that though
[13:47:20] <twb> I'm an armchair firearms nerd
[13:47:58] <twb> I was tempted to mention the SP-6 cartridge earlier, which has a captive piston between the explosive and the bullet
[13:49:19] <pussipupu> I'm a very diffusely targeted geek, so the rifling wasn't news but as I say I can't comment on the wisdom of the decision
[13:49:33] <twb> pussipupu: oh that.
[13:49:41] <twb> pussipupu: it's so they can fire a specific round they happen to like
[13:50:23] <twb> Since they don't actually go to war very much, it's nontrival to say whether that tradeoff is worthwhile
[13:51:14] <Me-me> Well until recently they were surrounded by the greatest success in anti-war efforts in the history of humanity.
[13:51:46] <twb> Me-me: wait... I know they LEFT the EU... but they didn't physically tow the island out into the north sea?
[13:52:05] <pussipupu> And even when we do go to war we don't always call it that
[13:52:17] <Me-me> Well no. But since they're not a part of it any more, I would say they don't benefit from the greatest benefit.
[13:52:32] <Me-me> ... Way to think up a synonym there, me.
[13:52:53] <pussipupu> *gain the greatest benefit
[13:52:58] <pussipupu> Would be my choice I think
[13:53:06] <Me-me> Insufficiently poetic :D how about "reap"?
[13:53:25] <Me-me> Anyway if the whole point is "you tend not to go to war with people you're strongly enmeshed in trade with", then yeah, leaving the EU ruined that protection.
[13:53:28] <twb> Well the citizens don't benefit from the human rights bits anymore, or the traders from the EEC, but they still benefit from not having actual roman hordes parked across la manche
[13:53:29] <pussipupu> Bit ominous in the context of war...
[13:53:37] <Me-me> True.
[13:53:47] <Me-me> To both.
[13:54:06] <pussipupu> But leaving the EU means the UK is no longer surrounded by EU maritime territory, so it's true to say they/we aren't “surrounded” any more at least
[13:54:19] <twb> Australia seems hell-bent on pissing off our biggest trading partner just to toady up to some dickheads who run the internet
[13:54:33] <pussipupu> As someone who lives in the EU, but is a British Citizen, pronouns are hard :þ
[13:55:00] <twb> pussipupu: hrm, UK isn't an enclave, like Lesotho?
[13:55:09] <pussipupu> Ei oo
[13:55:16] <pussipupu> Um, sorry, typo, no it's not
[13:55:37] <pussipupu> Sorry I'm having conversations in more than one language right now :þ
[13:56:00] <Me-me> Ei ei o.
[13:56:15] <Me-me> twb: Who do you mean?
[13:56:53] <pussipupu> Me-me: The UK is not entirely surrounded by another territorial entity
[13:57:18] <Me-me> No, his "trade partner" and "dickheads who run the internet" references.
[14:00:15] <Me-me> Your statement is true though. Without the EU, hypothetical foreign enemies could sail right up to britain without contractual reprisal from the rest of the EU.
