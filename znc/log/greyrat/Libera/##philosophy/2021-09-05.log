[00:16:03] <Thilastiko> religion is against progress
[00:16:52] <Ungwelian> I could say the same about democracy.
[00:16:56] <Thilastiko> thats why US evangelicals are against science

[00:46:29] <dfcnvt> Care to elaborate on time is a flat circle?
[00:47:15] <dfcnvt> I have my own interpretation of what time is...It is a thing of physical stuff that hits our sensory, and we are "perceiving" time as "time" moves "forward"
[00:47:25] <Thilastiko> maybe time is running forward and backward, right now
[00:47:55] <Thilastiko> a positron is just an electron moving backward in time
[00:48:11] <dfcnvt> Photon is the responsible thing that intercept our visual processing.
[00:48:29] <dfcnvt> hence the interpretation of time regarding the visual aspects.
[00:48:30] <Thilastiko> to a photon, there is no time
[00:48:43] <dfcnvt> Right.

[01:24:07] <Thilastiko> but in general, you can have language without having consciousness at all

[01:24:52] <Thilastiko> your computer is symbolic, is it "sophisticated" in the way you mean?

[01:26:43] <dfcnvt> Oh, okay.
[01:27:20] <Thilastiko> but from what I've read, langiage is just a recursive form of communication. and lots of things communicate
[01:27:40] <dfcnvt> I'll treat this as a valuable feedback.  It is hard to see one's own error.
[01:27:59] <Thilastiko> like your cat can meow to you to indicate that he wants food. - thats commnication

[01:28:58] <Thilastiko> that would be communication about communication - so recursive communication - so language

[01:30:49] <Descartes> If you were a virologist and a critical thinker working in a biology laboratory for Health Canada, what kind of evidence would convince you that the mRNA vaccines against Covid-19 are too dangerous to be used safely?
[01:31:26] <Thilastiko> you would see adverse effects in animal models
[01:31:59] <Thilastiko> or the people why formed the first clinical trials would grow nipples on their forehead
[01:32:08] <Descartes> ok, and what kind of numbers would convince you that the vaccine is dangerous?
[01:32:15] <I_Am_M00t> 5
[01:33:50] <Thilastiko> the numbers depend on the sample. In general you want to be no greater than a 5% chance of there being a real differnce between the treatment and random untreated individuals
[01:34:02] <dfcnvt> Any percentage should be zero be considered as completely safe.  If it's above 0%...then, it's the game of tolerance and the spell of necessity (to save the majority, despite)
[01:34:43] *** Glassbox is now known as Treefingers
[01:34:44] <Thilastiko> in any sample, people are just going to die or get sick randomly
[01:35:42] <Thilastiko> as long as there is no difference between the treatment and not-getting-the -treatment you are fine
[01:36:25] <Descartes> But what has to happen to convince you the vaccine is not working and it's hurting your subjects?
[01:37:19] <dfcnvt> Then it's back to the writing board to revise the vaccine to different formulas -- all the reason for doing science.
[01:37:38] <Thilastiko> the treatment group has to be significantly more sick than the control(untreated) group
[01:37:51] <Thilastiko> which is not hthe case with covid
[01:37:51] <Descartes> Assuming the vaccine is the independent variable
[01:38:11] <Descartes> But I think that's what the antivaxxers are assuming
[01:38:17] <Thilastiko> the variable is "being vaccinated" vs "not being vaccinated"
[01:39:17] <Thilastiko> antivaxxers assume a bunch of weird shit, thats the problem
[01:39:43] <Descartes> The antivaxxers would say sth like this:  "Half the subjects in my study got autism, mercury poisoning, aluminum poisoning and died of blood clots, but it was never reported because there's a government coverup and the media are part of the same vast global conspiracy."
[01:40:33] <Thilastiko> anything said without evidence can be dismissed without evidence
[01:40:53] <Descartes> So, if you were a virologist and you witnessed all that happening, what would you do?
[01:41:08] <Thilastiko> all what happening? a vaccine working?
[01:42:04] <Descartes> No, assume that the antivaxxers are telling the truth.  They are irrational and biased so they will accept anything that perpetuates their insane beliefs.
[01:42:15] <dfcnvt> Right, I have some "understanding" about the antivaxxers -- it's basically a recurring message, "it's the junk being put into your system, and you are allowing it!"  We're talking about people getting creative with their chemical thing and having that thing being injected into the "subjects" -- we are the subjects and we are the number to them.  They'll get to say, "Did it work? did it work?  No? Oh
[01:42:21] <dfcnvt> shit, back to drawing board"
[01:42:49] <Thilastiko> if there was a shread of evidence of those side effects the vaccine would be pulled immediately.
[01:42:56] <dfcnvt> That's the fear of how the whole operation works in creating the vaccine -- they may not be in fully control over to the content of the vaccine -- and merely view it as a sales.
[01:43:48] <Thilastiko> if antivaxxers really believed that bs they would be lining up to get the vaccine, just so they could sue pfizer
[01:43:58] <Inline> pfft
[01:44:07] <Inline> they are all protected in any form of being sued
[01:44:11] <dfcnvt> Like a cheap toy that function as a chair, and they call it as a vaccine -- so it is a business model that they should ensure to sell fear and hope for profit.  They don't care about the quality of the chair that it is a plastic toy.
[01:44:11] <Inline> 1.
[01:44:12] <Thilastiko> antivaxxers are liers, period
[01:44:23] <Descartes> but I'm asking the antivaxxer to assume the role of the virologist working in a lab, and assuming that the antivaxxers assumptions about a vast conspiracy and toxic vaccines that kill people are all true.
[01:44:37] <Inline> and antivaxxers are not really against vacination if the vacines work and are proven to work

[01:54:48] <Inline> the life-long does not refer to the acute, once it is memorized
[01:54:49] <Thilastiko> if they are intelligent they are lying bigots
[01:55:02] <Thilastiko> its more forgivable to be a dumb antivaxxer
[01:55:04] <Descartes> so assume you're talking to an intelligent antivaxxer who can twist anything they want to reinforce their irrational beliefs
[01:55:07] <dfcnvt> Perhaps it's a different mode of thinking that -- they'd rather be reactive than to be prepared for anything that may have harm on them.    If you got sick then that's when you'll know you need to get vaccined or whichever solutions to resolve it.
[01:55:16] <Inline> i wanna sell i wanna sell.....

[01:55:42] <Thilastiko> every single antivaxxer in the US had to get a whooping cough vaccination
[01:55:53] <Thilastiko> how much whooping cough is there out there
[01:56:12] <Thilastiko> you get the shot so that society as a whole has fewer problems
[01:56:43] <Descartes> Here's the question again for the antivaxxer to respond to:  "Now lets say you’re still that same virologist and critical thinker, what kind of evidence would convince you that the mRNA vaccines against Covid-19 are safe and effective for world-wide distribution?"
[01:56:44] <dfcnvt> I don't know.   There has been a time when I wish....that covid is deadlier...I mean very deadly that it'll instantly kill them.. Then we can do a real discrete.

[01:59:20] <dfcnvt> Descartes: The result of trails, the actuality that deserves its definition as a "vaccination"...meaning it's a cure against covid-19...Not some muddy definition that it doesn't do a whole job....Uhh, that's about it.

[02:00:25] <Inline> it does do worse with side-effects
[02:00:56] <dfcnvt> But I suppose, we should understand how antivaxxer came into existence as a group...They can be the pre-cursor into creating a politics, regulation much like FDA.
[02:00:57] <Inline> it is not clear what it causes future-wise
[02:01:36] <Thilastiko> antivaxxers came into existence because trump told them it was ok to be ingnorant
[02:01:40] <Inline> it is not tested with animals
[02:01:49] <Inline> it is being tested on humans
[02:01:50] <Inline> .
[02:02:03] <Descartes> so the antivaxxer would say, "aha, so if the vaccine protects 100 percent of the subjects in the trial who receive the vaccine to the extent that 0% of them get infected over the next 8 months after receiving their second dose and there are zero adverse reactions in that group, that would convince me as a virologist that the vaccine is safe and effective."
[02:02:36] <Inline> next 8 months ?
[02:02:38] <Inline> wth
[02:02:39] <Thilastiko> anivaxxers arnt really "numbers people" in the first place
[02:02:45] <Inline> what about for the rest of my life ?
[02:02:52] <Inline> lol
[02:02:53] <Descartes> is that how an antivaxxer would respond to that question?
[02:03:21] <Descartes> assume that the vaccine loses its efficacy after 8 months
[02:03:36] <Inline> but retains its side effects

[02:04:00] <dfcnvt> junkwise, it is what it is -- you decide"...That'll get them thinking, it'
[02:04:25] <Descartes> oh yeah, the antivaxxer would want a long term study to find out if the peple receiving the vaccine get adverse events like may be 5 or 10 years later, right?
[02:05:12] <dfcnvt> I suppose, it's like a very long trail that they'd rather wait -- maybe they have a cabin out there, living in the most isolated place.  So, no rush.

[02:06:24] <dfcnvt> If they ever want to explore the world or be in high population, then that's when they'll get the vaccination...But I suppose, it's not fair to label them as antivaxxer..just some regular people being wise how about the effect of vaccination.
[02:06:25] <Descartes> the antivaxxer would assume the poison and toxins won't become obvious until years later, when people become autistic, die of mercury poisoning, or their DNA changes years later and they become zombie freaks controlled by the microships in their blood
[02:06:26] <Thilastiko> so do these antivaxxers need these studies before drinking bleach or horse dewormer?
[02:06:50] <Inline> this is exactly the line, if i can get the real virus and get over it, why the need for the vax then ?
[02:06:55] <Inline> lol
[02:07:09] <Thilastiko> antivaxxers are just whining little children, and they need the government to act as their daddy

[02:07:26] <Inline> lol
[02:09:20] <dfcnvt> I think having the label as antivaxxer or the opposite is silly and too categorized....Let's think like a rational person, how can we be wise if we let our children play with the lab and their sole job is to create vaccination and be given to us?  We need to ensure trust that they are doing their job and the content we're putting in our body won't be junk nor harm.

[02:10:15] <Descartes> in that case, the antivaxxer would probably demand a 20 year long term study that monitors any adverse events or side effects for the subjects in the trial, to be absolutely certain the vaccine is safe, right?

[02:12:00] <Descartes> and until the 20 year trials are complete, the antivaxxer will have lingering doubts about the vaccine and assume it's not safe, and use that to justify their decision to wait and see.
[02:12:14] <Inline> death in that sence is ofc not necessarily an acute one, a shorter life-span is equivalent with that
[02:13:05] <dfcnvt> If you work as a virologist, you may learn many fine line about what works and what doesn't -- and the practice you do on a daily basis.  What if the virologist don't take any vaccine but is not a "message" to be given to the public as a means to follow his practice.
[02:15:14] <dfcnvt> If nothing happen to a person for 20 years long, surely he/she is not waiting for the complete veriable result but to continue to live happily as always without vaccination.
[02:15:18] <Descartes> yeah, so an antivaxxer virologist would refuse to be vaccinated until the long term trials are complete?
[02:16:17] <dfcnvt> If there's any such thing as the effects of long term -- I don't see the need to discount that.
[02:16:35] <Descartes> But let's say that at the end of the 20 year long term trial, the vaccinated people remain healthy, would that convince the antivaxxer virologist that the vaccine is now safe to use?
[02:17:09] <Inline> how bout you compare them with the recovered ones ?
[02:17:12] <dfcnvt> I mean, it's sort of the same thing with NMN (anti-aging), people out there have self-administrating for that goal, to live healthier and live long...but the result isn't clear as it require long long term.
[02:17:20] <Descartes> let's say 99% of them remain healthy with no side effects related to the vaccine, would that convince the antivaxxer that it's now safe to take the vaccine?
[02:17:29] <Inline> as long as i'm the one doing the statistics..... who cares

[02:19:05] <Inline> the few that dominate the market also dominate you
[02:19:15] <Thilastiko> capitalism is just professional feudalism
[02:19:24] <dfcnvt> Descartes: Perhaps, it's the focus of...does persuasion works in changing one's mind?  Or did anyone ever change their mind about anything?  Is there any disagreement that turn into agreement, if so, what is that technique and the work of art to change that alignment?
[02:19:52] <Descartes> good question
[02:20:22] <Descartes> may be you can't convince an antivaxxer or vaccine hesitant person with rational argument
[02:20:48] <Descartes> because they are motivated by fear more than information
[02:21:04] <Inline> pffft
[02:21:18] <Inline> if you die you die... there's no fear argument
[02:21:23] <Thilastiko> someone just needs to draw jesuses face in a vaccine vial
[02:21:35] <Inline> that's rather your argument, to induce fear and so sell
[02:21:37] <Descartes> even if the info is accurate and reliable, fear always trumps info, when people make decisions
[02:21:57] <dfcnvt> Right, and maybe they already have that ready (after-dialogue) mode of thinking, "...yes but..." to invalidate whatever you share it. or even divert it.

[02:28:32] <Inline> as if there's anything left to believe in made up sequences.....
[02:28:44] <Descartes> the ironic thing is that, just before all their children got whoopping cough, they realized their antivaxxer position was irrational and false and they had decided to vaccinate all their children.  But by then it was too late.
