[22:02:09] <riv> systemd was terrible at first, but now you can actually use user units, so im ok with it now
[22:04:08] <rahl> moonshine: a bit subjective, yes
[22:04:24] <moonshine> systemd was poettering's reaction to upstart not doing some stuff he wanted, and enterprise distros wanted something more ... enterprise-y
[22:04:43] <moonshine> then debian more or less decided it for the users.  it never really went up for a vote
[22:04:52] <moonshine> and here we are
[22:05:06] <MrElendig> cannonical not being in any way cooperative to use contributions didn't help
[22:06:52] <moonshine> i'm refraining from putting my own sauce on this topic. i prefer runit, and i'll leave it at that.
[22:07:02] <bougyman> My problem with systemd (and why I left arch due to it), was and remains the same. I want the most bulletproof PID1 possible. The surface area of systemd when it first began was already "huge" compared to what I was used to. The current one is "monumentally gigantic"
[22:07:17] <moonshine> i accept systemd as part of my arch linux installs but it makes me feel gross, if i stop to think about it.

[22:07:56] <phrik> https://i.redd.it/6sg63uxoyhoz.jpg
[22:07:57] <rahl> I took a chance raising the topic - not looking for war, just info
[22:08:08] <alad> not even runit is in any functional state since 3 years
[22:08:09] <NetSysFire> so yes it will stay
[22:08:20] <rahl> NetSysFire: I have - wondering the state of affairs a decade on
[22:08:28] <bougyman> I loved arch on runit. After systemd was released I was fine maintaining my own runit-init package and dealing with the differences, until I wasn't. systemd just spread its tentacles too wide for it to be feasible anymore.
[22:08:38] <bougyman> alad: I did.
[22:08:38] <moonshine> i don't think there's much point in shoehorning other inits into arch.  making a decision about init is something (imo) is very core to a distro
[22:09:10] <rahl> bougyman: My concern was how entrenched it appears to be
[22:09:19] <NetSysFire> rahl: if you are actually looking for info, systemd comes with stuff which will work universally on almost any other distro using systemd, like importaint sandboxing settings
[22:09:25] <alad> bougyman: but nobody after you did apparently :-(
[22:09:28] <alad> it all died out
[22:09:33] <moonshine> in theory, there's artix if you want to run something arch-like that's runit/s6/whatever. but that doesn't make it arch.

[22:10:06] <alad> NetSysFire: artix is based on removing libsystemd and udev even though there's no technical reason for doing so
[22:10:13] <bougyman> rahl: that became mine, later. The attack surface is now so great I think a systemd vulnerability will leave a big stain on Linux as a brand. I don't want it to happen, but it seems inevitable.
[22:10:18] <NetSysFire> alad: but evül systemd
[22:10:19] <alad> so you have a distro that rebuilds all of the repos and adds all kinds of broken hacks "because systemd offended me"
[22:10:22] <alad> NetSysFire: precisely
[22:10:43] <bougyman> That one last week was pretty bad.
[22:10:54] <NetSysFire> systemd does its very best to isolate stuff and this is why sandboxing settings were introduced, bringing a lot of security to basically everything
[22:10:55] <alad> bougyman: it's just another stain in a big shit show

[22:11:17] <NetSysFire> reminds me that i still need to finish writing my systemd sandboxing archwiki stuff
[22:11:23] <bougyman> alad: it died out because the maintainers moved and abandoned them.
[22:11:30] <alad> yes
[22:11:35] <bougyman> Bunch of us went to void.
[22:11:37] <alad> and apparently noone else had an interest to pick it up
[22:11:52] <alad> but hey, there's still busybox \o/
[22:11:57] <NetSysFire> and every, literally every, software will have security issues. sandboxing prevents a lot of the fallout
[22:12:14] <alad> yeah sandboxing like user namespaces, flatpak and all that stuff lol
[22:12:21] <alad> more like shitboxing
[22:12:22] <NetSysFire> systemds services, e.g resolved, timesyncd etc all come with sort of sensible sandboxing settings by default
[22:12:23] <moonshine> alad: you just inadvertently set off the busybox/toybox debate. and this is why we can't have nice things
[22:12:29] <alad> moonshine: ono

[22:37:41] <grawity> they just don't focus on, specifically, keeping alive a motley pool of random keyservers running known-vulnerable software connected together with a known-problematic gossip protocol
[22:38:26] <progandy> the old keyserver is basically unmaintainable in light of GDPR and the vulnerable gossip protocol, which is why hagrid (keys.opengpg.org) was written, but without federation.
[22:39:00] <MrElendig> matrixlark: it's only 4 lines of handwritten config
[22:39:16] <MrElendig> or 3, depending on your style choice
[22:39:18] <progandy> for the same reason some of the sks operators have resurrected another keyserver (hockeypuck) and try to build that into a modern federated replacement.

[23:17:20] <Protocol2> Sup guys, I ran into an issue which (as a noob) I'm kinda stuck on. I tried to update yay, but as it turned out that was impossible due to something to do with libalpm or something like that. Online I read that yay required pacman 6 to work, and to my surprise I only have pacman 5.2.2-3. I have no idea how to upgrade to pacman 6 other than -Syu'ing but that doesn't do anything.
