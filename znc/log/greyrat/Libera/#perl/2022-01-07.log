[00:28:18] <perlbot> daemon: ERROR: Global symbol "$test" requires explicit package name (did you forget to declare "my $test"?) at (IRC) line 1. 
[00:28:41] <daemon> I just wondered because it still referenced its self weather it would not be destroyed outside of scope
[00:31:52] <gordonfish> $test is only visible within the 'scopetest' sub block.
[00:32:13] <gordonfish> (That is where it is declared.)
[00:33:06] <gordonfish> If you instead declared it before sub scopetest { ... } then refering to $test outside of the sub block would work fine.
[00:34:57] <daemon> yeah I know been doing perl quite a few years :)
[00:35:07] <daemon> but I wondered if perl would still destroy test if it had a reference to its self
[00:35:29] <daemon> then again maybe it just destroys the reference to the structure and not the structure its self
[00:35:38] <daemon> hmmm who knows only pondering anyway
[00:35:53] <simcop2387> it'd still destroy unless self also had a reference to test

[00:36:47] <gloin> nevermind, I lazied out and used Parallel::ForkManager (which is really kind of rad)
[00:38:17] <alh> daemon: '$x = {}; $y = { x => $x }; $x->{y} = $y;' will stick around in memory until program exit unless you weaken one of the references or clean it up manually.
[00:41:28] <daemon> alh++ # I see that is the behaviour I was suspecting thank you
[00:41:50] <Grinnz> gloin: i recommend IO::Async::Function for this design
[00:41:51] <gordonfish> Yes, that is what refcounts are about. If something somewhere is still actively holding a reference to $test, than the value (in this case a reference to a hash) will remain, accessible by whatever is refering to $test, and thus not /as/ the variable $test itself, as that is unavailable as soon as the block ends (where the refcount is decreased by one, leaving a count of one, because of $ref
[00:41:55] <gordonfish> )
[00:42:06] <Grinnz> gloin: ForkManager can also work but not as featureful or composable
[00:42:45] <gloin> Grinnz: yeah, I'm encountering noise with it - A call to waitpid outside of forkmanager might have reaped
[00:44:10] <Grinnz> gloin: there's also https://metacpan.org/pod/Parallel::Map which is essentially IO::Async::Function with a Future::Utils fmap wrapper into one convenient function call
[00:44:10] <Paperbot_> Link title(s): [ Parallel::Map - Multi processing parallel map code - metacpan.org ]
[00:44:30] <Grinnz> which loses the composability factor, but might be useful anyway
[00:45:23] <Grinnz> (because it forcibly syncs your code, rather than letting the event loop be managed elsewhere)
[00:45:45] <Grinnz> but as a ForkManager analogue it's a nice abstraction

[00:52:19] <gloin> True, but rpm-maintained modules are automatically kept updated (although far, far from up-to-date).
[00:52:28] <Grinnz> i don't know of anything like that, if there was any conflict he's keeping it to himself and i don't care to pry

[00:54:51] <gloin> no
[00:54:59] <Grinnz> though if you're missing parts of core perl, that may not work eitehr
[00:55:06] <gloin> if cpan's not on this particular host it's for a reason
[00:55:19] <gloin> installing it will piss somebody off, notably my boss
[00:55:40] <gloin> I'll make an RPM of it on the build host. (shrug)
[00:56:06] <Grinnz> that's for you to work out, but i'll just note cpanm is 1) not CPAN.pm, 2) doesn't even need to be installed
[00:56:33] <Grinnz> and 3) can install modules locally either for your user or in a specific directory
[00:56:34] <daemon> 3) Is nicer than CPAN.pm

[04:14:44] <LeoNerd> Today's very Malcolm-in-the-middle coding went: So I need to get the outdoors weather station working again. Which means running it on my new RPi Zero. Which means getting a prometheus exporter on it. So I should try to find a slightly less dependency-heavy way of running prometheus exporters without needing IO::Async + NaHTTP::Server. So I'll write a minimal one on Future::IO. Except as a server that needs >>
[04:14:44] <LeoNerd> << ->accept. And it turns out that doesn't work on the libuv wrapping properly...
[04:14:47] <LeoNerd> So that's where I am
[04:15:10] <LeoNerd> I can't see how cold it it outdoors or which way the wind is blowing, because libuv's accept() wrapping seems to close filehandles a bit too early

[04:25:59] <aquanight> random question... is gather { take ... } a thing that exists anywhere? I've been wondering if it can be prototyped with what we have now...

[04:26:17] <LeoNerd> Just not got around to it yet
[04:26:34] <aquanight> and is it an "all at once" type deal or can it interleave generation with iteration
[04:27:27] <aquanight> I don't know if that's the right way to describe it
[04:27:33] <aquanight> coroutine type of stuff
[04:27:36] <LeoNerd> Perl doesn't have lazy lists, so there's no way to represent that
[04:28:02] <aquanight> hmm
[04:28:24] <aquanight> yeah foreach can only do it with an array (which can be tied to implement laziness)
[04:28:50] <aquanight> the only lazy iteration we can do is either tied array or each/readline-like

[04:29:17] <aquanight> honestly
[04:29:30] <gordonfish> LeoNerd: There's at least two: List::Gather and Syntax::Feature/Keyword::Gather
[04:29:47] <gordonfish> Oh, and Perl6::Gather
[04:29:58] <aquanight> I'm not sure how we could spell lazy iteration with foreach
[04:30:13] <LeoNerd> We can't currently
[04:30:24] * gordonfish has not heard of lazy lists before and wonders what they may be
[04:30:45] <aquanight> gordonfish: conceptually, a list value that doesn't fully exist at the moment it's evaluated
[04:30:46] <LeoNerd> Ahah! So.. turns out my Future::IO::Impl::UV wrapping is broken. :/ libuv doesn't like having two separate UV::Poll handles for a socket; one read and one write
[04:30:50] <LeoNerd> I have to combine the two :(
[04:30:59] <aquanight> in theory, it's a cromulent thing
[04:31:10] <aquanight> you could iterate it with foreach
[04:31:10] <gordonfish> aquanight: Sounds kinda quantumish
[04:31:15] <aquanight> it very much is
[04:31:27] <aquanight> and in theory an array composed from a lazy list could be a lazy array
[04:31:39] <aquanight> except what happens when an array is the concatenation of two lazy lists
[04:31:59] *** Joins: kitsunenokenja (~kitsunech@68.91.220.96)
[04:32:06] <aquanight> it could only be done by at minimum forcing a wavefunction collapse of the non-ultimate list
[04:32:18] <gordonfish> (or the compiler implodes)
[04:32:32] <aquanight> trying to handle it fully lazily just results in explosions
[04:32:56] <aquanight> as $array[4] would force wavefunctionc collapse of leading lists until it's known what list [4] must be in
[04:33:26] <aquanight> in practice our best option is each-like iteration

[04:35:22] <gordonfish> my ($key, $val) = each %hash
[04:35:40] <aquanight> indeed the element of multivalue iteration only complicates things further
[04:35:40] <gordonfish> Or would that be something new
[04:35:52] <aquanight> that's doable in foreach now but only just
[04:36:04] <aquanight> since you can now do for my ($k, $v) (%hash)
[04:36:47] <aquanight> I mean
[04:36:55] <aquanight> we like to push people toward foreach a lot of times
[04:37:15] <aquanight> each %hash -> use for my $k (keys %hash), or for my ($k, $v) (%hash)

[14:17:56] <gamo> how to obtain the help for how to pass byte to utf8 and viceversa
[14:18:44] <Botje> that statement makes no sense. utf8 is a way of mapping unicode characters to bytes.
[14:18:58] <Botje> perlbot: encoding mantra
[14:18:59] <perlbot> Botje: decode goes from BYTES to UNICODE CHARACTERS. encode goes from UNICODE CHARACTERS to BYTES. decode bytes to unicode characters as soon as possible, work with unicode characters, and encode to bytes as late as possible.
[14:22:36] <gamo> and decode() and encode() comes from the use utf8 module???
[14:22:52] <Botje> no, they are generic processes.

[15:00:09] <Xogium> heya folks :) thorny question probably… how does one debug a hang in a perl program ?
[15:00:30] <Xogium> as in, perl itself doesn't hang, but whatever it runs gets stuck
[15:00:39] <Xogium> very, very stuck
[15:02:12] <Xogium> this is super hard to reproduce so if it's something I can do without restarting the program, all the better.... It took me 2 weeks to hit the hang
[15:03:31] <choroba> Xogium: very hard to give generic advice
[15:04:16] <choroba> you can try strace (not sure what the equivalents are on non-Linux OSes)
[15:04:33] <Xogium> yep I tried
[15:04:42] <Xogium> there is absolutely nothing getting prointed
[15:04:52] <Xogium> radio silence
[15:04:56] <Xogium> *printed
[15:05:36] <Xogium> I tried to use gdb and attach to perl that way, then typed continue, and saw it moved  when I stopped it with ctrl+c
[15:05:43] <Xogium> so I'd so it's not hanging on syscall
[15:05:54] <choroba> so it's doing something
[15:05:57] <Xogium> *I'd say, damn, can't type
[15:06:25] <Xogium> I'd suppose so, but in that case why doesn't strace print anything ?
[15:06:50] <choroba> have you tried strace -f to track forks?
[15:07:01] <Xogium> yeah even -ff
[15:08:23] <Xogium> actually… I'll try something
[15:08:40] <Xogium> I'm going to attach gdb and continue execution in one window and attach strace in the other
[15:09:58] <choroba> making the program $SIG{USR1} sensitive and printing details on it can also sometimes help, but needs a restart
[15:10:35] <Xogium> erk well so much for that idea
[15:10:45] <Xogium> you can't attach strace while gdb is active
[15:11:57] <Xogium> yeah… man this sucks
[15:12:29] <choroba> they probably use the same trick to attach
[15:12:57] <Xogium> probably… ugh

[15:19:24] <choroba> do you at least have an idea what part of the code it'd been executing before getting stuck?
[15:19:47] <Xogium> it is frozen but the socket for allowing connection it still open. There's just nothing responding anymore on the other side

[18:31:00] <simcop2387> doubt i've complained about it, but my current kvm is doing something exceedingly stupid and causing the usb interface to not work with my work laptop, and with my personal one running linux there's all kinds of errors in dmesg for a few minutes after switching and then it finally properly resets and starts working.
[18:31:04] <daemon> then you might be able to do this:
[18:31:15] <daemon> say 'The Fibonacci array is: '.join(',',@array);

[18:34:45] <simcop2387> i love the fact that this new one can in theory do 8k resolution (30hz though), so it should be nicely future proofed.

[18:35:14] <daemon> the only one that is an exception is the external display on this one which is err
[18:35:18] <simcop2387> i'm at basically dual 1440p now
[18:35:26] <daemon> I have no idea 3440x1440
[18:35:27] <daemon> I think

[18:35:41] <simcop2387> daemon: ah one of those wide monitors, neat
[18:36:03] <daemon> I still really like my normal setup which is three 1080's OCD style identical
[18:36:28] <daemon> I got this one because of the desk and such it was the best fit in real physical terms
[18:36:33] <simcop2387> yea my dual 1440p is really a single 5120x1440 curved monitor.  replaced two 27" monitors for a same physical display size but more compact on the desk because there's no space/bezel in between.  it's also fucking beautiful
[18:36:55] <daemon> :D they do look pretty and futuristic
[18:37:11] <daemon> if you want a laugh go look at the touch screen ones, the price is insane
[18:37:54] <simcop2387> and once i get the new stand in for it i'm going to think about a third monitor now that i'll have space once i can put things in the right places
[18:37:56] <gamo> and the price?
[18:38:26] <daemon> that will be a monster desk with three 27" screens

[18:40:20] <gamo> that remainds me the rally for bigger auto tires
[18:40:42] <simcop2387> yea i looked at a bunch of 21:9 ones but decided i'd rather pay the premium and get a 32:9 so it's all normal resolutions and with the PBP support i can use it as a dual monitor setup for two computers at the same time still
[18:41:05] <daemon> well as I said I normally run three 1080's standard wide screens

[18:41:36] <daemon> even though the laptop could drive 3 1080's via a mdp box
[18:41:47] <daemon> it would just be dumb in the space
[18:41:50] <simcop2387> yea if you don't have space for anything else i'm sure it's still better.  but i decided to replace the two monitors i had with one so it's less space.
[18:41:55] <simcop2387> mdp box?
[18:42:08] <daemon> it connects to thunderbolt on the laptop and gives 3 hdmi ports
[18:42:19] <daemon> sure it was called a mdp box
[18:42:31] <simcop2387> ah so TB docking station with MST support then i bet
[18:42:39] <daemon> yep
[18:42:51] <daemon> when I was buying the laptop I had to make sure it supported it
[18:42:52] <simcop2387> MST being the multi-stream-transport thing that displayport has, and can then be down converted to hdmi
[18:43:01] <daemon> yep and sometimes it does not have it
[18:43:14] <daemon> but you can guaranteee it has it if its thunderbolt not just usb-c or w/e
[18:43:19] <daemon> its a requirement for tb
[18:43:30] <simcop2387> yea i've got a dual one on my laptop but kept having issues with my old setup for it since it didn't properly do hdmi only dual DP.  so i'm hoping the dual DP inputs on the new monitor will make it work nicely
[18:43:45] <daemon> oh dood the thing I got might work on that

[18:44:29] <simcop2387> been tempted to get a new one for my laptop, but i'll want to make sure it works with the Framework laptops too since i'll likely go for one of them "soon"
[18:44:45] <simcop2387> ah mini display port, no worky for me
[18:45:05] <daemon> but yeah that was because I thought the laptop would have to drive triple displays
[18:45:18] <daemon> then I bought this curved thing instead because of the physics of the desk
[18:45:19] <daemon> lol
[18:46:03] <daemon> it did actually drive triple monitor though, when I goto work with the laptop my work desk has 3 screens as well

[18:47:28] <daemon> I have seen people who have screens with like usb ports and audio and alsorts on them, they plug it into the laptop and it chages the laptop at at the same time etc
[18:47:30] <daemon> pretty cool
[18:47:50] <daemon> this laptop actually charges on usb-c though its something like 70W
[18:48:10] <daemon> I power it from its AC adaptor it came with
[18:48:33] <daemon> think we are slowly but surely moving to 'one cable to do it all'
[18:48:39] <simcop2387> yea i've seen those too but avoided them because that tends to not be compatible with KVMs
[18:49:10] <simcop2387> it'll probably get dealt with eventually but the overlap of people wanting/needing both is vanishingly small still
[18:49:32] <simcop2387> someone will make a TB kvm eventually
[18:49:36] <daemon> yep 
[18:49:42] <daemon> people hold onto hardware a long time
[18:49:46] <daemon> hardware is expensive now days
[18:49:57] <daemon> but one day it will all be tb/usb-c
[18:51:10] <simcop2387> yea i'm expecting it to start to happen in about a year or two with the whole USB4/TB4 stuff stabilizing and starting to become available
[18:51:23] <daemon> hmmm think about it ... in offices you have a tb/usb-c plate on the wall (where ethernet used to be)
[18:51:30] <daemon> the plate is powered of course and ethernet runs in the wall to it
[18:51:37] <daemon> and you just plug in and bank your on the network as well
[18:51:40] <daemon> fully powered
[18:51:58] <daemon> bang*
[18:51:59] <simcop2387> that might not happen for a while still, longer TB runs are still flaky but that might change soon too with that
[18:52:08] <fizzie> I do 2x 2560x1440 25" monitors (Dell U2520D, U2515H), and after a lot of fiddling and poorly documented display menus eventually got the work laptop to do USB-C to one monitor for charging, USB peripherals, DP alt mode for that monitor and DP MST for the other, for a single-cable solution.
[18:52:09] <daemon> nope I meant the plate is the termination plate
[18:52:22] <daemon> the plate has dc adapter mains->TB/usb-c
[18:52:28] <daemon> and standard ethernet wall cable runs normally
[18:52:47] <simcop2387> fizzie: yea mine's been a journey too.  i'm hoping that with this new fancy monitor + dual port kvm that i can simplify it a bit too
[18:52:49] <daemon> but you plug your laptop or w/e in to the wall plate and everything is changing and connected
[18:53:41] <simcop2387> yea i like how TB has been basically destroying the proprietary docking station market.  it needed to die a long time ago

[23:10:32] <gordonfish> Hmm. Right above "HISTORY" in https://metacpan.org/pod/Syntax::Keyword::Gather#HISTORY, it says: "Be aware that $_ in Perl5 is a global variable rather than the current topic like in Perl6."

[23:10:36] <gordonfish> I find this to be a bit misleading, as $_ when used with loops and map/grep type structures is effectively the current topic, or "it", variable.

[23:12:21] <Botje> but it's true
[23:12:57] <gordonfish> Which shows even more with nested loops, as $_ in the inner loop is the current "it" of said inner loop, but outside of the loop, both before and after, $_ is the current "it" of the outer loop.
[23:13:11] <gordonfish> Botje: What do you mean?
[23:14:17] <gordonfish> I admit I'm not very familiar with Raku(sic)'s "current topic" but I know that in Perl 5, $_ is mainly used for that purpose.
[23:14:44] <Botje> if any of the code you call modifies $_, yours is modified too
[23:15:43] <gordonfish> Yes, that's the global part, which is indeed true. (I also consider it a good thing in the right hands ;p )
[23:16:13] <Botje> it's spooky action at a distance
[23:16:27] <Botje> which most people's mental model does not accommodate
[23:16:59] <gordonfish> And as such it still works as a "current topic", like when you call a function from a loop that uses $_, than yeah the routine will see the $_ which the value of the current loop iteration.
[23:17:35] <gordonfish> Botje: Hmm, wow. Maybe I've just been using Perl so long that it's hard to imagine that not being a thing ;)
