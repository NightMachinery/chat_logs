[00:50:41] <vinrock> wat
[00:50:47] <vinrock> why are you asking questions like that
[00:50:47] <oxipital> https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/23/entertainment/nicole-parker-sex-city-trnd/index.html
[00:51:02] <oxipital> one of these things is not like the others, one is old and does not belong
[00:51:41] <vinrock> yikes
[00:51:45] <oxipital> also i think the reporter for this article ate another reporter during reporting it
[00:52:03] * oxipital fat shames
[00:52:47] <sd> 09<M​aster_ControlFlow> I think I just got offered a fake ass promotion
[00:52:54] <oxipital> ?
[00:52:55] <sd> 09<M​aster_ControlFlow> I’m afraid I’m getting fucked over
[00:53:21] <oxipital> if the fears there - you are
[00:53:33] <sd> 09<M​aster_ControlFlow> So my boss offered me a promotion from system admin to a job he called “kinda a technical underwriter” working directly for the VP
[00:53:37] <rpifan> you can take the promotion and if stinks use your promotion to undermind them
[00:53:39] <sd> 09<M​aster_ControlFlow> Comes with a pay raise
[00:53:46] <oxipital> ok
[00:53:56] <sd> 09<M​aster_ControlFlow> But I’m worried it won’t help me become a security engineer
[00:54:06] <rpifan> someone posted a lovely manual here once of what the resistance troops were told to do in order to undermine the nazis
[00:54:09] <rpifan> it had some really good tips
[00:54:15] <oxipital> seems like it would
[00:54:24] <oxipital> you're auditing technology
[00:54:33] <rpifan> real subtle stuff that people would never think of
[00:54:44] <sd> 09<M​aster_ControlFlow> He says I’ll still be technical “running cables through the ceiling” but tbh I  think he doesn’t know what I actually do at work
[00:54:59] <rpifan> well would you really loose out if you took the promo?
[00:55:00] <sd> 09<S​mellySalad> do you think you would enjoy it?
[00:55:12] <oxipital> why the hell would an underwriter do that?
[00:55:22] <oxipital> i don't think he knows what underwriting is
[00:55:38] <oxipital> pretty poor choice of words, even with the kind of
[00:55:39] <rpifan> an underwriter writes manuals no?
[00:55:45] <sd> 09<S​mellySalad> you spend alot of your time at work, if you think you'd enjoy it go for it
[00:55:46] <oxipital> assesses risk
[00:55:52] <sd> 09<M​aster_ControlFlow> Im afriad that if I accept and it’s not technical, I’ll fuck myself. I have to fly out across the country twice a month
[00:56:07] <sd> 09<M​aster_ControlFlow> I want every job I have now to groom me for security engineer
[00:56:08] <oxipital> you can set up a second family
[00:56:28] <sd> 09<M​aster_ControlFlow> Then secure clouds architect
[00:56:42] <rpifan> cloud architect with the same company?
[00:56:46] <sd> 09<M​aster_ControlFlow> Nah
[00:56:55] <sd> 09<M​aster_ControlFlow> I’d be leaving if that’s what I need to seek my goals
[00:57:18] <oxipital> so give it a shot
[00:57:18] <vinrock> take the raise, stack cash, start learning skils on the side then beat feet once you're good to go
[00:57:23] <sd> 09<M​aster_ControlFlow> I actually don’t care what I get paid at work as long as it’s more than 50k
[00:57:24] <oxipital> if you dont like it, leave
[00:57:25] <vinrock> and youll have more money in the stack
[00:57:26] <rpifan> yea i agree with everyone here
[00:57:29] <sd> 09<M​aster_ControlFlow> I work for knowlege
[00:57:37] <oxipital> heh
[00:57:40] <vinrock> apparently the knowledge bar is drying up over there huh
[00:57:41] <rpifan> yay few times do we almost all agree on something
[00:57:42] <sd> 09<M​aster_ControlFlow> True but would it hurt my resume
[00:57:47] <vinrock> so get that money
[00:57:48] <oxipital> nope
[00:57:54] <rpifan> your resume can be made to look and say anything you want
[00:57:54] <vinrock> wat
[00:57:54] <oxipital> you did it, you didnt like it
[00:57:57] <sd> 09<M​aster_ControlFlow> I will do it and try it out then
[00:58:00] <vinrock> hurting resumes sounds dumb
[00:58:11] <oxipital> if anything trying and deciding it wasnt for you shows maturity
[00:58:12] <rpifan> thats just an excuse to keep you oppressed
[00:58:16] <sd> 09<M​aster_ControlFlow> And I have my buddies company headhunting me for 80k to be a pentester anyway
[00:58:22] <vinrock> if i went to hire some dude and another dude was his exact clone, but on his resume he admits he once dug ditches
[00:58:31] <vinrock> im hiring the guy that also knows how to dig itches
[00:58:38] <sd> 09<M​aster_ControlFlow> Lol
[00:58:44] <oxipital> in that case, if you really want to be a security engineer it makes sense to jump ship
[00:59:06] <sd> 09<M​aster_ControlFlow> My boss said “I’d learn way more in this new role”
[00:59:12] <oxipital> always take the straightest path
[00:59:22] <sd> 09<M​aster_ControlFlow> I’ll try it then jump ship if it’s a shit sandwitch
[00:59:24] <oxipital> yeah so? how does he know?
[00:59:38] <vinrock> youll also have a direct ine of communicatoin with the exec vp
[00:59:42] <vinrock> sp you can brown noe if thats your jam
