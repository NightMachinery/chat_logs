[03:14:24] <Ali_nz> Morning people
[03:15:16] <Ali_nz> If I have migrated my OVPN install to a new computer, but need to generate some new client requests (before transferring them to the signing CA machine) can I just reinstall easyrsa on the VPN machine without breaking anything?
[03:18:01] <rob0> um, you seem to think you need a new CA/PKI with a new machine
[03:18:26] <rob0> and BTW it was never recommended to have easyrsa on the VPN server
[03:19:30] <Ali_nz> rob0: I followed the digital ocean tutorial
[03:19:36] <Ali_nz> for ubuntu 20.04 
[03:19:47] <Ali_nz> it seemed to be the best guide I could find
[03:19:56] <rob0> ah.  OpenVPN has its own howto.
[03:20:16] <rob0> Anyway, sounds not so good to me.
[03:20:35] <Ali_nz> rob0: yes. it seems that way
[03:20:37] <rob0> You can continue to use the existing PKI.
[03:21:13] <rob0> you can run easyrsa anywhere, but ideally not on the VPN server
[03:21:24] <Ali_nz> rob0: so apart from not being best practise, it wont break anything to install easy-rsa and generate new reqs for a client?
[03:21:48] <Ali_nz> requests for a *new* client that is
[03:22:15] <rob0> if you do a new CA certificate, the old ones won't work
[03:22:33] <rob0> but if you copy over the old install you are fine
[03:25:04] <Ali_nz> i am just wanting to install easy-rsa (sudo apt-get easy-rsa) then make a ~/client-config and a easy-rsa gen-req someclient
[03:25:31] <Ali_nz> (which is step 6 here https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-and-configure-an-openvpn-server-on-ubuntu-20-04 )
[03:53:33] *** Parts: micah (~micah@debian/micah) ()
[04:04:27] <rob0> easyrsa is just a set of shell scripts with a little database of certificates
[04:04:38] <rob0> just copy the old one
[04:05:47] <Ali_nz> I dont have a "old one" - the server certs etc are still there, so I assume it wont hurt to sudo apt-get easy-rsa
[04:06:50] <rob0> your new one won't have the CA you have been using, unless you copy it
[04:07:13] <rob0> what did you do, wipe the storage of the old machine?
[04:07:42] <Ali_nz> the VPN server and its related config files got moved to a new machine. The VPN server side of things is working
[04:08:02] <Ali_nz> I have a seperate machine, a CA signing machine - that is still original
[04:08:19] <rob0> so why not stay with that?
[04:08:23] <Ali_nz> I just now want a few new client crts/keys
[04:08:31] <rob0> generate them
[04:08:38] <Ali_nz> rob0: so could I just generate the clients and sign them on the CA signing machine?
[04:08:48] <rob0> that's best practice
[04:08:56] <rob0> well, second best
[04:09:30] <rob0> Best is that clients generate their own keys & CSR, send CSR to CA, CA signs and returns the cert
[04:09:49] <rob0> but in the real world that does not happen
[04:10:48] <Ali_nz> I know this is perhaps going a little OT, but what if my CA was signing for multiple different organisations? what would stop a key/crt for one organisation connecting to a different organisation?
[04:12:20] <rob0> well, indeed, if you have one CA signing for everyone, they could potentially connect to the other's VPN
[04:12:57] <rob0> which is why it's an insane idea (yet also FAQ!) to use LE certificates for openvpn
[04:13:32] <Ali_nz> LE?
[04:14:45] <rob0> we often see people asking about using Let's Encrypt certificates for their VPN
[04:15:24] <Ali_nz> ah ok

[16:20:23] <yogg> Hi
[16:21:36] <yogg> Is there a way to manipulate the openvpn internal routes ("--iroute") on the fly?
[16:21:50] <yogg> Or can the only be changed if a client connects?
[16:22:04] <rob0> if so, it would be via the management interface
[16:22:31] <yogg> I already search there and found nothig :(
[16:23:37] <rob0> you read the whole part about --management?
[16:25:53] <yogg> I where connected to the management port via telnet and searched in nearly every option (which "help" gave me back -> I hope there are no hidden options?)
[16:26:56] <rob0> there is a section in the man page about it, and I think a txt file in the source
[16:27:49] <yogg> https://community.openvpn.net/openvpn/wiki/Openvpn24ManPage Do I have the wrong manpage?
[16:28:58] <ordex> yogg: that's about 2.4
[16:29:16] <ordex> but I don't think you can add/remove iroutes on the fly
[16:29:16] <rob0> dunno, if you're on the current version it's 2.5, the wiki has a link, but it's not hosted there
[16:30:18] <rob0> build.openvpn.net/man/openvpn-2.5/openvpn.8.html (or of course "man openvpn" on your own system)
[16:32:20] <yogg> https://build.openvpn.net/man/openvpn-2.5/openvpn.8.html Can't also find anything "iroute" specific here in the management part?
[16:35:11] <rob0> yeah, I don't know, it was never something I needed to do
[16:35:42] <yogg> I just had an other idea. maybe I can do this withour iroutes. But thanks for the help

[17:16:07] <ordex> yogg: you may want to share what exactly you want to do :)
[17:18:07] <yogg> I try to bould something HA like (currently one server and 2 Client boxes, both route the same net, if one fails the other should take over). Maybe I just think to complicated
[17:18:24] <yogg> But my other idea does not work
[17:20:49] <yogg> I think the only way I can do is is by controlling openvpn on the client boxes with keepalived (if one fails the other one starts openvpn, but never both at the same time) this will work but has some drawbacks
[17:26:15] <yogg> maybe even this will not work. The server will take some time until it realizes that one box is gone. In the meantime the failover box is already connected. So the server deletes the iroute of the mainbox (witch is also the iroute for the failover box).
[17:26:21] <yogg> I have to test this
[17:27:00] <ordex> yogg: with DCO that may work, if routes are installed with different metrics...but at the moemnt that is not supported, I think. but it'd be a reasonable use case to support
[17:28:13] <yogg> yea if "iroutes" would support metics this would be realively easy beacause then they would no overwrite each other wich is currently the case
[17:30:55] <ordex> exactly
[17:31:08] <ordex> that can be easily implemented with DCO
[17:31:16] <ordex> I wonder if this is the best way to solve this problem
[17:31:21] <ordex> but metrics across iroutes makes sense
[17:39:31] <yogg> ok the keepalive aproach does also not work. 1.) mainbox connects , 2.) mainbox fails (power off), 3.) failover box starts openvpn, iroute is set, everything works (ping works). 4.) server realizes after some time (30s in my case) that the mainbox is gone and deletes the iroute which is also the iroute for the failover box -> ping stops working :(
[17:42:35] <yogg> hmm, I joust could set up 2 openvpn server instances on the server. This would solve my problems. Also both boxes can be connected at the same time and I can work with linux route metrics
[17:42:44] <yogg> Maybe this will be the way I go
[17:43:28] <ordex> yogg: want to give dco a try?
[17:43:35] <ordex> it'd be nice to test this use case
[17:43:43] <ordex> (and I'd be happy to get some feedback :))
[17:45:26] <yogg> Sorry I searched DCO when you posted it the first time bug got only some generic infos back. So I thought this would be some general way of doing something like this.
[17:45:26] <yogg> Is this a piece of software?
[17:45:28] <ordex> it should just work with iroutes, because they are implemented differently
[17:45:58] <ordex> yogg: DCO == Data Channel Offload. is a linux kernel module that handles the data channel entirely in kernelspace
[17:46:23] <ordex> the code for supporting this module is not upstream yet, so you'd have to build openvpn yourself
[17:46:37] <yogg> ahh https://github.com/OpenVPN/ovpn-dco
[17:46:40] <ordex> (unless you are on some $redhat distro - we have packages for those)
[17:46:43] <ordex> yes
[17:46:46] <ordex> that's the kernel module
[17:46:48] <BtbN> It's not exactly in working order yet, so don't get too exicted
[17:46:52] <ordex> then yo need a patched openvpn
[17:47:06] <ordex> well, it's beta, so it's being used by various people on a daily basis
[17:47:19] <BtbN> I've been trying to use it, and found it too unstable for daily use
[17:47:27] <BtbN> Like, all my clients just de-auth every few minutes
[17:47:37] <BtbN> And I can't run openvpn as non-root
[17:47:40] <ordex> BtbN: where did you report this issue? I must have missed that
[17:47:44] <BtbN> here
[17:47:48] <ordex> yeah, the non-root is a long term thing
[17:47:56] <ordex> oh I did not see anything about client disconnection
[17:48:03] <ordex> when did you build it ?
[17:48:11] <BtbN> Two days ago, from the dco branch on main github
[17:48:22] <ordex> there were bugfixes around renegotiations a few days ago
[17:48:34] <ordex> BtbN: do you have the commit ID? just to double check
[17:48:57] <BtbN> They immediately re-auth themselves, but it's a noticeable "blip" each time
[17:49:02] <BtbN> "OpenVPN data channel offload (ovpn-dco) 09083d0" is the kernel module
[17:49:08] <BtbN> let me see if openvpn tells its commit anywhere
[17:49:17] <ordex> it should in the --version IIRC
[17:49:18] <BtbN> OpenVPN 2.6_git [git:dco/42d5ac72c462150a+]
[17:49:59] <BtbN> Just adding disable-dco to the config is all it takes to make it be stable, so it's definitely dco related
[17:50:29] <ordex> ok, so your ovpn-dco lacks the commit from march 8th, which i was talking about
[17:51:09] <ordex> and consequently also openvpn had some changes applied around the same time
[17:51:26] <ordex> if you have time, would you mind rebuilding and checking if the same still happens?
[17:51:28] <BtbN> I'll remerge them both and give it another go
[17:51:33] <ordex> thanks!
[17:51:41] <ordex> please, highlight me when you report anything about DCO
[17:51:42] <BtbN> it's pretty trivial on gentoo really
[17:51:52] <ordex> BtbN: did you create an ebuild for that ?
[17:52:00] <ordex> (for both)
[17:52:02] <yogg> is this only needed on the server side or also an client side?
[17:52:02] <BtbN> for the kernel module, yes
[17:52:23] <ordex> yogg: on the server side for what concerns your use case. but it can also be used on the client side if you want
[17:52:26] <BtbN> And I modified the normal openvpn git ebuild to support dco
[17:52:32] <ordex> hehe cool
[17:52:42] <ordex> do you have an overlay? or it is just local?
[17:52:44] <BtbN> https://github.com/BtbN/gentoo-overlay/tree/master/net-vpn stuff is here if you're interested
[17:52:49] <ordex> aha!
[17:53:22] <ordex> have you tried pushing the ebuilds upstream? (for dco and openvpn3)
[17:53:53] <BtbN> The openvpn3 one is on the gentoo bugtracker, but I doubt it'll be considered before it releases proper
[17:54:02] <ordex> maybe
[17:54:14] <BtbN> I'm also lazy and don't use anything but systemd, so I didn't bother writing openrc services for openvpn3, which are a requirement for any realistic chance to upstream it
[17:54:40] <ordex> right
[17:54:43] <ordex> I don't use systemd :p
[17:55:42] <BtbN> I wonder if I can run it as non-root if I launch it directly as openvpn-user via systemd and add the neccesary CAPs
[17:55:57] <ordex> I think you should be able to
[17:56:03] <ordex> but I never playd with it
[17:56:29] <BtbN> Starting it as root and then making it setuid itself breaks its ability to interface with the dco
[17:57:43] <BtbN> I guess the correct way to deal with that would be to massively complexify the setuid code, so it retains CAP_NET_ADMIN?
[17:58:34] <BtbN> Ok, running with "OpenVPN 2.6_git [git:dco/a80a21feea4d5f29+]" and "OpenVPN data channel offload (ovpn-dco) a69a526" now

[18:15:18] <BtbN> Yeah, if I connect via IPv6 it works

[18:18:47] <ordex> yap yap, it's a special corner case, that honestly I don't test often
[18:18:54] <ordex> must have got broken at som epoint
[18:18:55] <ordex> *some
[18:19:22] <BtbN> Hopefully an easy fix
[18:20:19] <ordex> well, you know, it depends[tm]
[18:20:23] <ordex> :)
[18:20:31] <ordex> will let you know when there is something ready to test
[18:20:37] <mannequin> ™
[18:20:48] <ordex> thanks
[18:21:56] <mannequin> np
[18:24:12] <yogg> ordex: only to understand it right. If I compile openvpn 2.5 and the dco kernel module on in my case debian 11 I can simply ignore the iroutes? I just set the "normal" kernel routes and because openvpn ofloads everything to the kernel this will work?
[18:25:18] *** Quits: trace987 (~trace@user/trace) (Remote host closed the connection)
[18:26:58] <ordex> yogg: you have to clone the openvpn repo and checkout the dco branch
[18:27:14] <ordex> it is not merged into 2.5 yet
[18:27:17] <ordex> it will be part of 2.6
[18:29:25] <ordex> yogg: then yes, compile, install and load the kernel module
[18:29:38] <ordex> openvpn will automatically pick it, unless you are using an incompatible option
[18:33:55] <BtbN> don't even need to load it, it loads it itself
[18:34:22] <ordex> true!
[18:35:23] <BtbN> something I'm a bit confused about: The openvpn README.dco says to pass the include path to configure
[18:35:33] <BtbN> but then I see it not being used or mentioned anywhere else in the entire codebase
[18:37:21] <ordex> BtbN: no, that has been removed
[18:37:25] <ordex> did I not modify the README?
[18:37:27] * ordex checks
[18:37:36] <BtbN> I didn't check in the last couple days either
[18:37:41] *** Joins: trace987 (~trace@user/trace)
[18:37:56] <ordex> indeed I did not
[18:37:58] * ordex is changing it now
[18:38:00] <ordex> thanks
[18:38:17] <BtbN> openvpn3 does use and need it, but 2 does not seem to
[18:38:38] <ordex> openvpn2 does not because we decided to ship the header file directly along with openvpn
[18:38:45] <ordex> and avoid hassles
[18:38:48] <BtbN> ah, fair
[18:38:55] <ordex> (it's common practice with kernel headers)
[18:39:12] <BtbN> The kernel is not supposed to break userspace API/ABI anyway
[18:41:44] <ordex> correct
[18:41:51] <ordex> so an old header won't make any difference
[18:42:05] <ordex> when a new feature is implemented, then the header can be updated accordingly
[18:42:11] <ordex> ;)
[18:47:31] <yogg> ok, https://openvpn.net/blog/openvpn-data-channel-offload/ sounds interesting. I give it a try. If it will only fix my routing problems then I'm already happy. If I get speed on top this would be great :)
[18:47:51] <ordex> :)
[18:48:00] <ordex> yogg: please, keep us posted
[18:48:49] <ordex> yogg: some more details are being collected here: https://community.openvpn.net/openvpn/wiki/DataChannelOffload
[18:49:36] <rob0> I've also been meaning to set up a server with DCO.  Stupid $dayjob keeps me too busy. :(
[18:50:58] <yogg> Only to make sure. https://github.com/OpenVPN/openvpn/tree/dco this is the right branch? And I need both the openvpn 2.6 dco branch and the kernel module (the module is not included in the openvpn dco branch)?
[18:52:42] <ordex> yogg: you are correct
[18:52:51] <yogg> thanks
[18:52:53] <ordex> np
[18:53:04] <ordex> check the readme.dco.md for the appropriate configure flag
[18:53:18] <ordex> as dco needs to be enabled at compile time
[18:53:28] <yogg> kk
