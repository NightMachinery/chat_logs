[03:42:35] <ramblebamble> are you using X still?
[03:42:41] <dob1> yes, xorg
[03:42:53] <ramblebamble> k
[03:43:15] <dob1> ramblebamble, it was automatic, I didn't mean to change it. I update it yesterday to 21.10 and it was done by the system upgrade
[03:43:28] <ramblebamble> k
[03:43:51] <ramblebamble> then, can you still disable it using xset +dpms and xset -dpms?
[03:44:05] <ramblebamble> because if you cannot do that something else changed in your system
[03:44:06] <dob1> ramblebamble, well yes but ... no :)
[03:44:19] <ramblebamble> ??
[03:44:46] <ramblebamble> I don't suggest you do that all the time, I am just asking for information so that we may get to the bottom of this
[03:44:47] <dob1> it becomes a bad user experience if I have every time I am going to watch a video to disable dpms
[03:44:57] *** Quits: Itaru (~Itaru@ro2.flokinet.is) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[03:45:25] <ramblebamble> so if you can do this, it is either i3 or most likely FF, if you cannot do that than FF cannot do it either, and we have to look elsewhere
[03:45:49] <ramblebamble> s/then/than
[03:46:05] <dob1> to be honest I don't know how an application, firefox, vlc whatever, communicate to suspend dpms while watching a video

Everytime I login to Windows 10 and when done, when I return to Ubuntu, I get the BusyBox v1.30.1 initramfs issue where I have to fsck /dev/sda1... It fixes the problem. I rarely ever use Windows but when I do, the error comes back again and have to fsck the partition and then all is well in the world.
[04:32:27] <ShookDog> As mentioned rarely use Windows and shutting down computer, logging back into Ubuntu, no problems. It's only when I log into Windows 10 and then logging into Ubuntu I have to fsck the partition. Any help would be great.

[05:15:56] <ShookDog> Its supposed to be in the Power setting... where you allow whats normally not available. Fastboot is not one of the options. Just Hibernate and Sleep. No Fastboot.

[07:34:11] <jhutchins> bobdobbs: First lesson in downloading from github.
[07:35:31] <jhutchins> If it's a basic system thing that many people would use within the Ubuntu system, try to find the Ubuntu package before you start grabbing wild code.
[07:36:14] <bobdobbs> jhutchins: this tool isn't in the standard repos. Or any repos for ubuntu as far as I could tell
[07:36:26] <jhutchins> At least you didn't do `make install` and create a monster.
[07:36:40] <bobdobbs> heh. I haven't done that for years
[07:36:50] <jhutchins> bobdobbs: Then maybe it's not something a basic user should be trying to use.
[07:36:57] <bobdobbs> jhutchins: indeed
[07:37:41] <bobdobbs> jhutchins: I'm now looking at a utility called 'xmodmap'. Looks like it's installed by default.

[07:44:22] <bobdobbs> hm... I don't think xmodmap will work either. I need to give it the keycode of the prtsc button. But if my current keymapping isn't working, then that keycode probably isn't linked to that button anyway
[07:44:54] <jhutchins> bobdobbs: Yeah, that's more likely the one I'm thinking of.
[07:45:44] <jhutchins> It'll show you what code is generated.
[07:45:53] <bobdobbs> jhutchins: all good. I found the keycode
[07:46:10] <jhutchins> Which is often captured by a screenshot utility.
[07:46:21] <bobdobbs> jhutchins: there's a tool called 'xev' that will show you the keycode of a button that you press.
[07:46:39] <jhutchins> xx:51
[07:48:11] <jhutchins> Ah, xmodmap is display and modify the map.
[07:49:24] <jhutchins> yeah, xev is what I was thinking of, displays a window and returns event texts.
[07:49:40] <jhutchins> ood luck, I'm outa here.
[07:49:42] <sarnold> and then you'll need to hook up the keypress to run a command or something
[07:49:56] <sarnold> I don't know what the best way to do that is, perhaps your desktop environment already has one of those

[08:11:06] <Sven_vB> I usually just run "scrot" with the delay option from command line.
[08:13:46] <Sven_vB> in cases where I need keyboard watching temporarily, and thus want to avoid my xfce's global hotkeys, I usually use something like "xinput test 15 | sed -nurf transform.sed | sh". not sure if sed is to your taste.

[14:32:26] <KBar> krzydv: you mentioned downgrading from 10.1 to 5.7. You're confusing the two packages. You don't have `mariadb` installed, which was indeed version 10.1. The `mysql` suite, however, is on version 5.7.
[14:33:32] <KBar> krzydv: your system didn't "want" to upgrade the `mariadb` package, it attempted to upgrade the `mysql-server` package.

[19:10:47] <ubottu> Guest4005: End-Of-Life is when security updates and support for an Ubuntu release stop. Make sure to update Ubuntu before it goes EOL so you get updates promptly for newly-discovered security vulnerabilities. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EOL and https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Releases for more info. Looking to upgrade from an EOL release? See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EOLUpgrades

[20:25:50] <arsix> this line is getting executed but i still end up in qwerty. it doesn't happen if i log in with the stock ubuntu WM, though, so i'm not sure what's going on here. anybody have any ideas?
