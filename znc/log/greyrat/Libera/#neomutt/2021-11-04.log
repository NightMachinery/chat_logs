I've created a test user, created a .neomuttrc file with just those in it, to ensure my long muttrc isn't negating it somehow and yet saving an email to foo.gz creates a mbox file not a compressed mbox file .. am I missing something?

[18:31:27] <M4rty> Hi ! When `set abort_key = "<Esc>"` in my config file, other keybinds no longer work (for exemple \eb for sidebar toggle). Anyone have a solution ?
[18:34:46] <flatcap> hi adray 
[18:35:12] <flatcap> M4rty: unfortunately, the `\e` in your sidebar binding is an <esc> too...
[18:35:47] <flatcap> the abort key has the highest priority, so <esc>b becomes <abort> + b
[18:36:17] <M4rty> Ah OK ! Is there another way to bind alt key ?
[18:38:30] <flatcap> sorry, no.  that's how curses handles Alt- combinations (and I'm not ready to rewrite ncurses, yet :-)
[18:49:04] <M4rty> OK ! It's not very important... Thanks flatcap ! Neomutt is awesome !!
[18:49:33] <flatcap> you're welcome
[18:49:42] <adray> how's it going, flatcap?

[19:08:40] <bookworm> normal regex is ?
[19:09:11] <bookworm> (by some definition of normal)
[19:15:35] <gahr> a... regular regex..
[19:16:19] <flatcap> :-)
[19:18:15] <adray> so what you're saying is a regular regular expression uses ?
[19:20:37] <gahr> flatcap: curious, where did you pick the = for 0-or-1?
[19:21:18] <eblake> POSIX defines BRE and ERE (basic and extended regex), BRE lacks 0-or-1 (but many implementations add \? as an extension), while ERE has ?
[19:21:31] <eblake> that's the fun of regex - there's so many flavors to choose from ;)
[19:21:44] <flatcap> :-)
[19:21:58] <flatcap> gahr: vim  :help \=
[19:22:25] <flatcap> I don't know what favou[?=]r that is, though
[19:23:34] <flatcap> ah, judging by the docs, it's to avoid conflict when searching backwards with ?
[19:26:28] <gahr> I wonder why it won't take ?colou\?r
[19:26:28] <todd> gahr: yes wrt compress
[19:27:33] <todd> I had it working with mutt, updated to neomutt, swore it work also, have some archival bits that save to xz compressed folders that turn out to not be so compressed anymore
[19:27:50] <todd> I'm planning to simply redo the scripts to archive to regular mbox and then compress later
[19:28:17] <todd> it will open .xz but just not create it
[19:29:28] <flatcap> gahr: I think it will, but if you search forwards, then reverse your search, the search term isn't altered
[19:30:00] <gahr> but why does a ? in the middle make any difference?
[19:30:16] <gahr> it's escaped, as you'd escape a /
[19:30:35] <gahr> anyway
[19:30:42] <todd> http://ix.io/3E0x
[19:30:48] <todd> just incase rev info makes a diff
[19:32:47] <gahr> todd: so your compress close-hook doesn't get invoked anymore?
[19:34:04] <todd> when creating no
[19:34:40] <todd> its append if its existing so .. I guess .. no
[19:34:57] <todd> it just saves mbox file to foo.xz, no compression
[19:35:34] <todd> http://ix.io/3E0A
[19:35:45] <todd> its not like I've a complicated test .neomuttrc or anything
[19:36:16] <todd> guess I should see about building the latest from github just to confirm its present or fixed in master
[19:36:19] <todd> ?
[19:36:43] <flatcap> I've just tested master.  it seems broken too
[19:37:00] <flatcap> saving to abc.xz gives me a plain text file
[19:37:02] <todd> whew, I'm not crazy
[19:37:25] <flatcap> yep, it's our fault.  sorry :-)
[19:39:06] <flatcap> do you have a GitHub account?  if so, would you mind raising an issue?  https://github.com/neomutt/neomutt/issues
[19:39:21] <todd> I'll do that in a few, but yes I have one
[19:39:35] <flatcap> thanks
[19:55:01] <gahr> nice
[19:55:07] <gahr> flatcap: is that a feature you use? 
[19:55:12] <gahr> do we have anybody using that?
[19:55:18] <gahr> well, now we do :)
[19:58:33] <flatcap> no, but I did overhaul the code long ago
[19:58:43] <flatcap> it _used_ to work nicely
[20:00:01] <todd> I have procmail filter stuff on the mail server into mbox.YYYY-MM and then locally save e.g. lists.openbsd.2021-10 to Mail/archive/2021/10/lists.openbsd.2021-10.xz 
[20:00:34] <todd> using isync to sync mail to local since I like having offline mail reading capabilities
[20:03:37] <flatcap> the alternative, is to find a filesystem with transparent compression
[20:03:57] <todd> well, OpenBSD saving to ffs2 not likely. 
[20:04:21] <todd> I'm of the world where .. long term archives may as well have front end cpu spent to max compress, then they can be copied with max savings anywhere I pay to have a backup
[20:04:47] <flatcap> fair enough
[20:05:02] <todd> so long as open works, I'm happy, though its disconcerting to have it worked in the past vs now. *shrug*. prepping to file issue now.
[20:05:50] <todd> probably kludgy to use neomutt to select a Maildir box and save to a compressed mbox via scripts in the first place but ..
[20:07:48] <todd> hopefully you won't kill me for a 5 line paste but heres a snippet of the script .. 
[20:07:53] <todd>                 echo "macro index,generic i \"T~d 1/1/'$y'-31/12/'$y<Enter>;s./${newxz}<Enter>q\"" > $tdir/macros
[20:07:55] <todd>                 echo "folder-hook \"$file\" \"push l.<Enter>i\"" >> $tdir/macros
[20:07:58] <todd>                 echo "set sort=mailbox-order" >> $tdir/macros
[20:08:01] <todd>                 [ -f "$dir/${newxz}" ] && ls -l "$dir/${newxz}"
[20:08:03] <todd>                 $mutt -e "source $tdir/macros" -f "$file" < $tty > $tty 2> $tty
[20:09:58] <flatcap> eek!
[20:15:52] <todd> actually thats the wrong section, another section skips the date range and just saves it all .. but .. pushing the call of a macro in a script to fully automate going through all my YYYY-MM folders was the goal. now all I have to do is change 'newxz' to 'new' and 'xz' it later ;-)
[20:16:18] <gahr> flatcap: didn't we change the order of calling hooks vs. opening folders or something?
[20:17:23] <flatcap> I don't think so.  I thought the folder hook should come later, but you pointed me at the docs, so I left it be
[20:17:47] <todd> https://github.com/neomutt/neomutt/issues/3122 .. shiny spiffy
[20:18:33] <todd> it's been a while since I noticed, I just .. manually compressed .xz files that were not actually compressed files .. been having lots of real life "distractions" from coming here to actually report it
[20:19:18] <todd> and by "a while" proably 1-2 years give or take a year or two .. 
[20:19:31] <flatcap> thanks.  I'll have a dig later
[20:20:02] <todd> understood. I'm obviously not in a panic. glad to have validation that I'm not crazy. ;-)
[20:20:16] <flatcap> oh!  they're uncompressed _that_ far back?
[20:20:21] <flatcap> :-)
[20:20:53] <flatcap> that might rule out our recent major refactoring
[20:22:40] <todd> NeoMutt 20210205
[20:23:04] <flatcap> ok
[20:23:10] <todd> thats what I'm running now, don't exactly keep version history of when I flipped from mutt to neomutt either
[20:23:28] <flatcap> ok
[20:27:16] <todd> Mutt 2.1.3 (2021-09-10)
[20:27:21] <todd> that does work
[20:28:19] <todd> http://ix.io/3E0R
[20:28:27] <todd> just incase all the output of -v is in any way useful
[20:29:43] <flatcap> ok, thanks
[20:29:49] <todd> http://ix.io/3E0S
[20:30:11] <todd> if testing any of those versions is helpful let me know. I can install a dated openbsd vm and install the released package of the time...
[20:31:14] <flatcap> thanks, will do
