[00:00:41] <alkisg> beachpeach: eh, it depends... small rare programs => it's ok to git clone and compile | a bit more common => they should at least be on npm or pip | very common => should have at least deb and rpm packages
[00:00:43] <Guest67> alkisg that's what I though... neither do I tbh except for my own stuff that I use internally.and I did check out the link that you just sent before but it seems kinda self-contradictary as well, unfortunately. /var/local => "Note that even locally installed programs should use the other /var directories if they are appropriate, e.g., /var/lock.".
[00:00:44] <Guest67> which kinda begs the question, why does it even exist..?
[00:01:22] <Nei> beachpeach: Also depends on how much burden you want to put onto yourself
[00:01:44] <alkisg> Because of what I said; if you want to make sure that your local program won't conflict with any distro-provided package with the same name

[00:04:02] <beachpeach> If the program is large and useful enough, and fully free-and-open, is it reasonable to expect package maintainers to package it? (Or any other thirdparty that isn't me)
[00:04:13] <Nei> there is also some infrastructure to assist you in producing packages, such as ubuntu PPA or the opensuse open build service which can be used for fedora and ubuntu/debian too

[00:04:57] <Guest67> alkisg fair enough. It's just the wording of that paragraph that irritated me. But I guess that settles it then. And you're not supposed to use /var/local/LIB/myapp then, right? just without the "lib"?
[00:05:01] <Nei> and if you have created a very popular program chances are indeed that some distribution maintainer will just package it
[00:05:43] <Nei> however that will usually happen because many distribution users will request it
[00:06:05] <beachpeach> So what happens when I make updates? Does it have to be repackaged for each update?
[00:06:25] <Nei> "kinda"?
[00:06:29] <alkisg> Guest67: you're the commander of /usr/local; you decide what you put there since it's all your own code. Personally I follow the paradigm of /opt, where things go under /opt/package/<subdirectories>, not like /var/<subdirectories>/package
[00:06:50] <beachpeach> OK, thanks for answers!
[00:06:58] <Nei> normally you make "releases" of your program and give them a version number

[01:29:00] <nickgaw> so optional features like file systems are not included then?

[01:31:17] <nickgaw> So a generic kernel is probably better in the long run as I have heard that an optimized kernel is better and possibly faster?
[01:31:57] <pantsu> there are userspace packages that you would probably get better milage from recompiling
[01:32:11] <hodapp> the chances of it being faster in a way that matters at all are extremely low

[01:32:33] *** Joins: ivii (~ivan@user/ivii)
[01:32:38] <nickgaw> ok as I have heard that kernels compiled for your own hardware are faster sometimes.
[01:32:56] <pantsu> seldom
[01:33:04] <pantsu> specially not noticable faster
[01:33:07] <RayTracer> if there are generic optimizations to do, distros likely already did that. I'd advise to use the distro .config and do a make olddefconfig

[01:35:33] <tesseract> I was compiling kernel with only necessary component for my PC. the only advantage was faster boot
[01:35:36] <nickgaw> Why do most versions not support the 386 systems or 486 systems anymore?

[01:36:07] <pantsu> (if talking about actual 386)
[01:36:16] <pantsu> not that it really supported it in the first place either
[01:36:20] <nickgaw> yes real 386 pc
[01:37:03] <ayecee> i guess keeping support for 386 or 486 required compromises in other areas.
[01:37:28] <ayecee> compromises that were difficult to justify as 386 and 486 disappeared from common use
[01:37:54] <nickgaw> What was before 286?
[01:37:58] <ayecee> 186
[01:38:11] <nickgaw> There was really a 186?
[01:38:18] <ayecee> yes
[01:38:22] <ayecee> you can look it up

[01:38:52] <ayecee> you can look that up too

[01:39:23] <ayecee> you can also look that up

[04:56:57] <mags> Back to the original question though, Python stores strings as objects.  If you are using python standard tools to write a file, you pass that string object to the python function, which should then do whatever encoding is needed for the filesystem.  If you are going to be calling outside functions (via system calls) you probably should worry about the text encoding then.

[09:37:54] <openbsdbeta> im running freebsd on this laptop, i just needed something that would work easily, and freebsd was already installed
[09:38:04] <openbsdbeta> and freebsd is useable enough without xorg
[09:38:08] <Andrew> I need a program, similar to less(1), that reads documents, but in a paginated fashion (i.e., there MUST be a key to jump to the next Control-L sequence in the file)
[09:38:17] <fossforus> I wish freebsd worked in vmm
[09:38:21] <fossforus> or netbsd
[09:38:33] <Andrew> The file is a plain text paginated RFC. which contains ^L as page break s
[09:38:33] <fossforus> it's weird linux works in vmm before either of those
[09:39:11] <openbsdbeta> whats vmm
[09:39:13] <Andrew> You can run Linux in vmm? Cool
[09:39:40] <jim> Andrew, I wonder of something like / ctrl-v ctrl-l would work

[09:43:34] <openbsdbeta> how is it?
[09:43:42] <jim> you would only have to enter the / ctrl-v ctrl-l <enter> once, after that (for subsequent pages), / <enter> should work

[09:44:59] <openbsdbeta> i honestly have no idea what any of this is, i know nothing about that stuff lol

[14:17:33] <hexnewbie> Point is, if two letters are never the first letter of a word, you never use Shift to type them, because you never capitalize a word starting with them, so they can share the same key, using Shift, and then Caps Lock would capitalize them as intended.

[14:37:52] <gurkenglas> or if i'm still not getting it, spell out the reasoning for the expiry date like i'm 5? :)
[14:38:28] <hexnewbie> gurkenglas: Do note that an expired key can't be used to send you encrypted mail (well, gpg should refuse to do so, at least), so people won't send you stuff you can't read after it expired and you lost the key. You may ask why a key server would allow you to update an expiration date *after* the key has expired, but that's a separate issue
[14:38:42] <pantsu> gurkenglas: reduces the damage from misuse of the cert if it gets lost/stolen
[14:39:29] <gurkenglas> pantso, how so @stolen? After all, whoever steals it can change the expiry date.
[14:40:10] <gurkenglas> hexnewbie: So is the gpg maintainer's stance that key servers should not let people change the expiry date, and if that were followed expiry dates would be useful?
[14:41:07] <hexnewbie> I'm not the GPG maintainer and I don't know what their stance is
[14:41:35] <gurkenglas> Do you think that either this is their stance or you don't see why they would have expiry dates?
[14:41:47] <hexnewbie> I'm just saying, that if the parties privy to the public key stuck to the old expiry date, it will prevent stolen keys from being used after it
[14:42:19] <Polo> I see
[14:42:28] <Polo> Smart!
[14:43:26] <gurkenglas> hexnewbie, "to the private key", I assume you wanted to say. so the idea is that the expiry date lets you not worry about scenarios where the key is stolen after it has already expired?
[14:43:48] <hexnewbie> You can always revoke the key in the event it is stolen, though. The expiration date comes into play when you no longer have the key. Not having the key *and* having it stolen is too much of bad luck, I guess.

[22:46:08] <Helmholtz> OK, another question. Do you guys know dmenu? It's a utility to handle user input or present some strings...Can I have read -r my_var in my bash script, but in my caller client, forward it to dmenu?
[22:46:19] <Helmholtz> Like I don't want to hardcode handling user input with dmenu in my script. Is it possible?

[22:46:57] <Dagmar> I don't know dmenu, but you can probably make your life easier if you just abstract that with variables
[22:47:21] <rascul> dmenu is a dynamic menu for X, originally designed for dwm. It manages large numbers of user-defined menu items efficiently.

[22:47:40] <Dagmar> Per example, `dialog` is ancient but a very known and mostly understood thing, and there are a few variants of it that display an actual GUI instead of a TUI
[22:48:28] *** Joins: Barones (~Barones@user/Barones)
[22:48:33] <Dagmar> I never ever hard-code `dialog` in my scripts.  I use $DIALOG, and then I can just do a quick check to see if 1) X is running, and 2) xdialog/gdialog/kdialog are installed and then change the variable
[22:48:41] <tangy> "hardcode handling user input..." does this refer to sanitizing untrusted user input, filtering out unprintable strings or shell keywords, etc
[22:48:49] <Guest6> and finally about cookies. here is Google books and pay attention to each company because their use of cookies specifies what the cookie collects about its visitor.  If you are an IT admin in the future, you can make a big cookie from all the other cookies.  you could get paid 100,000$ a year because your good at sysadmin for instance
