[18:23:38] <rob0> Google is known to accept and discard mail sometimes.  They are awful.
[18:24:33] <rob0> !deliverability
[18:24:35] <dig-dug> rob0: deliverability: (#1) If you're having problems getting your mail received by major ESPs you should first check your !fcrdns, then make sure you have SPF, DKIM and DMARC configured (see !easy_dmarc). Sign up for the dnswl at http://www.dnswl.org. Also sign up for ESP-specific programs such as feedback loops, Google postmaster tools and Microsoft's SNDS., or (#2) Check the individual postmaster pages for each ESP that
[18:24:36] <dig-dug> rob0: you're having problems with to make sure that you're in compliance with all of their policies and if you still have problems contact the support for the ESP., or (#3) Also check to make sure you're not on any DNSRBLs and submit removal requests from any you appear on. See !multirbl.
[18:25:49] <rob0> ^^ try all that but if they are going to discard your mail you're out of luck.  They'd be happy to sell you email service.  They're big enough to get away with such garbage.
[18:27:39] <rob0> (If you are going to pay a big player for service, I would suggest Microsoft.  They at least seem to care about their recipients being able to get mail from small sites.)
[18:33:41] <masber> ok,
[18:33:50] <masber> I admit I setup my mail server
[18:34:11] <masber> and I did not do an ideal job
[18:34:39] <masber> but my point is, if I receive an OK, I would expect there is no issue at my end
[18:34:47] <masber> or am I wrong?
[18:41:47] <rob0> An open source MTA like Sendmail or Postfix would generally reject mail it does not like for some reason.  (They can be configured to be irresponsible and discard mail, of course, but most sites would not bother to do that.)
[18:41:52] <velix> crazy question, it's not possible to "buy" ip addresses with good reputation, is it? ;)
[18:42:49] <rob0> spammers are always on the lookout for clean IP space they can spoil.
[18:44:10] <velix> rob0: okay, I'll have a look in the darknet.
[18:44:16] <velix> thanks for the idea.
[18:44:21] <rob0> yw
[18:44:24] <velix> :D
[18:44:58] <velix> I wonder, what will happen to blacklists when IPv6 will get used.
[18:45:09] <velix> denylists*
[18:45:12] <rob0> I worry about that too.
[18:47:06] <rob0> I think the best model for ipv6 is a default-deny policy, only allowing specific addresses.  That can be difficult to scale outside of DNS allow-lists, and can hand too much power to the allow-list operators.
[18:48:30] <rob0> IPv4 DNSBL services basically have spam under control.  Sure, spammers are always sneaking around the blocks, but soon enough they are detected again.
[18:52:27] <rob0> I think if I ever get ipv6 on my mailhost (!) I am going to use a separate MX name with AAAA with lower priority.  My "0" and "1" names will remain ipv4-only.
[18:54:21] <masber> is there a tutorial to setup sendmail properly?
[18:54:37] *** Quits: furrymcgee (~devuan@cgn-89-1-211-93.nc.de) (Quit: leaving)
[18:55:52] <rob0> There's no reason to think your Sendmail configuration is wrong.  Usually it's something outside the MTA, such as poor IP reputation, or lack of FCrDNS.
[19:10:52] <velix> rob0: Yeah, that's the problem here, too.
[19:11:02] <velix> SFA, DMARC, DKIM etc. are fine.
[19:11:15] <velix> But the IP get on blocklists even with transactional mails ;)
[19:13:35] <velix> I'm sooo angry about the university IP dropping the good IP.

[21:02:38] <masber> what do I need in oder to have an email server well setup to be able to send emails? I have sendmail, I have my fcrdns
[21:02:42] <masber> what else do I need?
[21:16:13] <CyberTailor> masber: MX, SPF, DKIM and DMARC DNS records
[21:21:56] <tuxick> and a proper provider
[21:28:13] <masber> why a provider? why can't I setup my own email server?
[21:29:08] <tuxick> you need an internet connection :)
[21:29:50] <thumbs> masber: in this day and age, you really should not set up your own email server, no
[21:32:27] <Khepra> sadly.   :(
[21:32:33] <masber> why?
[21:33:41] <Friithian> well if you want to do something on the internet, you need a connection to it
[21:34:48] <Khepra> masber: because no matter what you do, you'll have deliverability issues with big providers, and the amount of skill and knowledge required to set it all up properly, and issuficiently, is just a waste of time.
[21:35:23] <tuxick> yeah, i wasted years learning now
[21:35:28] <Friithian> also some providers block email traffic 
[21:35:30] <tuxick> and all customers move to o365
[21:35:44] <masber> ok
[21:35:54] <Khepra> masber: you definitely do need a public IP address in a neighborhood that is NOT blacklisted
[21:36:11] <taman> masber: you'll need a VPS provider with a "reputable" network, i.e. probably not the cheapest end of the market. If you do that and set things up right, it might work out for you (source: works out for me).
[21:36:11] <thumbs> masber: I know what your skill level is, and your strenghts. It will be a struggle for you.
[21:36:16] <taman> So I say, give it a try.
[21:36:47] <tuxick> what doesn't kill you makes you struggle
[21:37:17] <thumbs> taman: on the contrary, the months / years spent at it will not have a good ROI
[21:37:37] <tuxick> close to 0 :/
[21:37:40] <taman> thumbs: disagree. Welcome to the Internet!
[21:38:28] <Khepra> well you can disagree all you want. the biggest problem is that deliverability is sometimes completely beyond anything you can do on your end.
[21:39:25] <thumbs> throwing masber on that train is going to be painful for him, either way
[21:39:46] <Khepra> I mean, if you want to do it for the Achievement Unlocked, sure. Why not. be prepared to lose mail and to get spammed to hell until you teach your spam filter what to do.
[21:40:06] <taman> It depends on what "sometimes" turns out to be and whether you consider it too much. I think the difficulties are overstated here.
[21:40:43] <taman> I don't recognize my experience in a lot of these comments. E.g. my spam filter has little to do because DNSBLs are so good.
[21:41:25] <Khepra> I consider the "sometimes" a constant requirement to ping your recipient to ask if they got it, IF they don't respond in some reasonably expected timeframe.
[21:41:37] <taman> Again, not my experience.
[21:41:38] <Khepra> because GMail will accept, 200 OK just fine, and never deliver it. Not even to Junk.
[21:42:59] <tuxick> also using barracuda?

[21:44:22] <Khepra> last week I started some personal projects with some friends. I could easily copy off the configs from our main corporte MTA which I've built over the last 10+ years, configs, tuning, bayes learning, ...     But. I can't. Be. Assed!   GSuite, click, click, five dollahs, and I'm done in less than 2 minutes.
[21:45:09] <thumbs> yes, it is just a giant time sink, and I have lost the motivation to start over on a new server
[21:45:30] <jaybe> as long as you are fine with your data being held by s third party then o365 is still a mountain of shiny gold
[21:46:09] <jaybe> love the clients that recognize handling their own data 
[21:46:23] <jaybe> those are about the only these days i’ll entertain
[21:46:24] <Khepra> I am perfectly fine with that.
[21:47:03] <Khepra> wow! google will know about our meteo enthusiast correspondence!
[21:48:03] <Khepra> and for some reason you think the "third party" doesn't already hold copies of every unencrypted email you've sent somewhere else, via who knows whose hops.... it's all unencrypted because I'm going to bet 10 NFTs you don't encrypt contents. do you?  :)
[21:49:19] <Khepra> and all the gmail/o365/satan's-email-system  users who sent email to you, or got it from you. all that "data" is where, do you think?
[21:50:51] <jaybe> “by choice” or not matters in particular contexts
[21:51:38] <Khepra> it matters not. your argument seems to be that some "big data" boogie cyborgman is holding your "data". is if they don't, even if you have your own MTA in your basement's basement.
[21:51:51] <Khepra> *as if
[21:52:04] <tuxick> they 'only' use it for profiling
[21:52:07] <jaybe> i’m not arguing. eof
[21:52:16] <tuxick> they don't need to store complete copies
[21:52:21] <Khepra> they've won. no amount of guerilla activism from my end via personally maintained MTAs is going to change that. Ain't nobody got time for that. I wanna enjoy life before I kick the bucket.
[21:52:42] <jaybe> do that. 
[21:52:49] <tuxick> Schneier wrote nice book about this, Data and Goliath
