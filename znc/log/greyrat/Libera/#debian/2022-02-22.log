[01:00:20] <ZAJDAN> Khepra: for example have anytime everytime same IP
[01:00:39] <Khepra> if you have same IP then why did you say you had TWO IP ?
[01:01:42] <greycat> I think they're saying that they can't reserve an IP address on their workplace DHCP server, so they always get a dynamic address if they use DHCP at work.  Whether that's actually TRUE is a different question, but that's what I think they're saying.
[01:02:01] <ZAJDAN> Khepra: same IP in home network (10.2.2.6) same at work (192.168.2.6)

[01:07:31] <Khepra> actually... I wonder if NM profiles are even easier? I don't use NM so I don't know, but it sounds like that would actuall be even better. you just click and select the network, done.
[01:07:41] <amacater_> On a home router from your internet provider: there is often an administration page which allows you to assign a constant address to one machine.
[01:07:46] *** Joins: tomg (~tomg@user/tomg)
[01:08:04] <amacater_> Effectively a DHCP lease which always gives the same IP to the same MAC address
[01:08:14] <Khepra> most do that on their own
[01:09:33] <ZAJDAN> Khepra: option 2 use different interfaces ...in /etc/network/interfaces  I have enp0s3 and enp0s3:1
[01:09:46] <Khepra> ZAJDAN: why
[01:10:01] <Khepra> I was thinking about having two different files under /etc/network/interfaces.d/
[01:10:03] <amacater_> Khepra: they don't always give the same consistent IP to the same machine that will survive reboots and so on. Reserving an address as "static" like that means that one MAC gets one address all the time.
[01:10:07] <greycat> How I'd do it with two contradictory static IPs (one working at a time) would be to set up a local DNS resolver, and have it go straight to the real root servers, the way the gods of the Internet intended.  Of course this only works if workplace lets you use DNS correctly.
[01:10:20] <greycat> If you *have* to use workplace's DNS nameservers, it gets MUCH harder.
[01:10:39] <Khepra> ZAJDAN: then you alter the default include to source a *.conf;  then you rename your interface file: home.conf   and  work.conf.inactive   ; then you rename around when you're at work
[01:10:50] <Khepra> but again... this really sounds like a job for NetworkManager profiles
[01:11:09] <amacater_> NetworkManager works nicely

[01:13:28] <Khepra> assuming one is always inaccessible by IP, and the other is always accessible, by IP, between work and home
[01:13:29] <greycat> if you can live with a delay, I suppose so
[01:13:47] <karlpinc> ZAJDAN: greycat is right.  Easiest is to run dnsmasq or unbound or something on your laptop, and go right to the internet for name resolution.  (Use the root nameservers or something like google's 8.8.8.8, although there's no real reson to use the latter it might make $WORK_ADM happier for some reason.)
[01:14:03] <karlpinc> ZAJDAN: You just put 127.0.0.1 in your resolv.conf.
[01:14:27] <Khepra> that assumes the @work network permits DNS queries to outside
[01:14:48] <karlpinc> The name resolution delay does not work in actual practice.  Applications time out.
[01:14:58] <greycat> 20:1 odds ZAJDAN doesn't know whether their workplace permits it
[01:15:10] <Khepra> WELL IN FACT ..... why run a resolver? :) just stick nameserver 8.8.8.8 in your resolv.conf and call it a day. heh

[01:16:05] <karlpinc> Khepra: But you do get better performance if you run a local nameserver.

[01:17:39] <greycat> Khepra: one possible guess: if they looked up a work-internal name and used the public nameserver first, it would say NXDOMAIN instead of timing out
[01:18:03] <ZAJDAN> Khepra: yes host system is windows 10
[01:18:03] <Khepra> but that wouldn't error out with "temporary failure in name resolution"
[01:18:10] <Khepra> nxdomain is very much ENODOMAIN
[01:18:23] <PerfDave> ZAJDAN: Since you're dealing with routing issues across networks, the fact that you're using a virtual machine *does* matter, and the networking on the VM host *does* matter
[01:18:25] <karlpinc> Khepra: In my experience, the apps time out with dns resolution errors before the failover works.  (That's why linux-ha is good to failover nameservers, instead of having multiple NS RRs.)

[01:54:06] <jaggz> unfortunately, it's the K80 that I need to use for machine learning
[01:54:17] <jaggz> (since they're 12gb each, and my 1050 is only 4gb)
[01:54:56] <somiaj> Looks like you will be on your own then, or ask nvidia if there is a way to get the k80 to work with the drivers in bullseye
[01:55:23] <jaggz> https://www.nvidia.com/Download/driverResults.aspx/164092/en-us
[01:55:28] <somiaj> Debian really doesn't nicely support installing drivers other than the ones it provides. Note you can install the drivers directly from nvidia.com -- you just have to be careful with upgrades and manually reinstall each time kernel/glx stuff is upgraded
[01:55:42] <jaggz> there's that, using the "runfile".. it's been a long time since I've had to use their runfile for installation :/

[01:57:29] <somiaj> It almost seems those are a different set of drivers though, since they don't list the standard cards either. I'm not familar enough with nvidia outside the gefroce cards though.

[02:03:12] <somiaj> strange, nvidia's serch for the TITAN chips seems to give the 460, even though it wasn't listed
[02:08:48] <jaggz> somiaj, yeah, weird.  I was looking at this though nvidia-tesla-460-driver
[02:09:45] <jaggz> the deb info says to look at a readme in it, so I downloaded and extracted it.. it lists K80 in there
[02:10:30] <jaggz> here's hoping!
[02:10:43] <somiaj> Seems the driver in bullseye supports your cards, so might be some other issue you are having
[02:11:18] <jaggz> somiaj, 418 supports it.  I had an issue when it went to 510 from a cuda update
[02:11:49] <somiaj> what version of debian are you running?
[02:12:07] <jaggz> going to 460 now (let's see if it gives me the kernel error where it can't complete the install.  In the past it only required the reboot and the new one went in.. this recent stuff led me to an install failure).. we'll see
[02:12:12] <jaggz> stable
[02:12:38] <somiaj> then you should be running 460, not sure why you keep mentining 418. Also unsure where you got 510, since it is only in experimental at the moment.
[02:13:06] <jaggz> (because nvidia-detect didn't mention anything above 440 as supporting the card)
[02:13:14] <jaggz> 440 wasn't available, so I tried 418.
[02:13:47] <jaggz> (the system was not functioning for a while so I went ahead and did 418 just to get it up and running, even though I "knew" the cuda version wouldn't be supported at 418)
[02:14:36] <jaggz> nvidia's cuda package (non-free) updated my system to 510

[13:23:31] *** Joins: johnjaye (~pi@173.209.64.74)
[13:23:34] <Khepra> HiHoGo_: well, tl;dr, linux and unix-like systems have a concept of users and groups; files and directories have ownerships and access rights
[13:23:52] <Khepra> so you can't just willy-nilly edit files around your system.
[13:23:53] <HiHoGo_> basically if i add  user to a group they can have access to all the gropup permissions and such
[13:24:20] <jelly> HiHoGo_, we need some actual information to figure out why it does not work.  So, if you're copying from usb stick to local folder, which exact source path and exact destination path?
[13:24:23] <Khepra> unix/linux aren't like windows where you're expected to be "administrator" and have access anywhere. even windows dropped that concept nowadays.
[13:24:27] <HiHoGo_> what makes you think i dont know this already
[13:24:40] <HiHoGo_> I have been using linux on and off for over 5 or more years
[13:25:00] <HiHoGo_> my first linux os was ubuntu 5
[13:25:07] <Haohmaru> 5 or more years may mean nothing
[13:25:19] <Khepra> so linux has a concept of "administrator" and that is the root user (uid=0). however, again, desktop environments and many applications will REFUSE to work if you're logged in as root as that's not expected at all.
[13:25:19] <jelly> all you've said thus far is making us think that :-)
[13:25:39] <Haohmaru> some people are using windows for over 20 years, and they're still running it as admin
[13:25:47] <Khepra> HiHoGo_: meanwhile, if you're not logged in as root then, naturally, you can't access files that aren't owned by the user, or the user otherwise has no permissions.

[13:26:23] <Khepra> NOW.... desktops have ways to _temporarily_ elevate your privilege if you really need to run something as root. gnome desktop, for example, has the concept of admin://  URI scheme
[13:26:31] <HiHoGo_> i cant even add files in /usr/share
[13:26:44] <Khepra> HiHoGo_: you're not expected to be able to do that
[13:26:56] <Haohmaru> HiHoGo_ so you wanna copy files from some usb stick onto the system folders, well, if you're sure you wanna do that - open a terminal, log in as root, and have fun

[17:55:22] <Khepra> sussudio: is that the fact? does unattended-upgrade cross the releasever?
[17:56:37] <Khepra> ns12: when 11.2 changes to 11.3, 11.2 ceases to exist except in archives. theree's no "support period" for previous point releases. a point release is only a change in number somewhere. packages otherwise upgrade regularly, you don't change the _repo_

[17:56:48] <sussudio> Khepra: why wouldn't it go from 11.1 to 11.2.
[17:56:55] <sussudio> it's both "stable".
[17:57:15] <Khepra> major release change (11 -> 12) is different _repo_ and as stable becomes oldstable, packages in oldstable ar supported for a year or so and then go under LTS and later ELTS support.

[17:59:05] <Khepra> unattended upgrade of major release change would be one helluva adventure :)
[17:59:32] <sussudio> it certainly won't do a dist-upgrade on its own

[18:01:15] <dpkg> Point releases are updates to <stable> and <oldstable>, fixing security & grave bugs. If you track security updates regularly (as you should!) there will often be no updates for you in a point release. Upgrade by referencing a Debian <mirror> in /etc/apt/sources.list, then "apt update && apt full-upgrade". See <10.11> <11.2>. https://wiki.debian.org/DebianReleases/PointReleases.

[19:22:59] <Khepra> duuude: I meant THE debian installer. the app that runs when you boot from the installation ISO. it's has TUI (ncurses) and GUI (frame of buffers) modes.
[19:23:38] <duuude> so it is an interface issue? it not having the options for that?
[19:23:48] *** Joins: johnjaye (~pi@173.209.64.74)
[19:24:26] <Khepra> it's more like nobody bothered to add it. but probably the interface would be quite complex, given all the features and possibilities of zfs.
[19:24:38] <remote> that is the way

[19:26:23] <duuude> is it wise to use that?
[19:26:37] <Khepra> zstd?
[19:26:41] <jelly> can't say they invented it but they made it work outside of pricy closed-source storage systems
[19:26:42] <duuude> yes
[19:27:15] <jelly> what kind of data do you have that you absolutely need zstd compression?
[19:27:26] <Khepra> I don't really see the gain. lz4 is fast enough for comparative equal compression rate. it's probably in edge cases of kinds of data you store, where zstd might be a better choice.
[19:27:45] <duuude> It has faster decompression
[19:28:00] <Khepra> it has slower, or faster, than lz4, depending on parameters used
[19:28:24] <jelly> duuude, did you test this on your data, or just read it somewhere?
[19:29:06] *** Quits: johnjaye (~pi@173.209.64.74) (Ping timeout: 250 seconds)
[19:29:12] <jelly> because it's kind of important what you store on it, and how much, and how much of I/O is reading and how much is writing
[19:29:47] <duuude> jelly: read it somewhere
[19:29:48] <jelly> benchmarks will differ from your real load
[19:30:02] <duuude> I just want programs to load faster
[19:30:15] <jelly> buy an ssd.
[19:30:21] <Khepra> ZFS is nice because ARC retains compressed blocks, unlike linux pagecache. right now, on this machine, with 32G of ARC size and 1.5 compress ratio, it _literally_ downloaded, from thin air, 16GB for the cache :))

[19:33:15] <duuude> jelly: imagine it is hdd or something
[19:33:21] <Khepra> duuude: in theory, compression causes less data throughput for same mount of iops, per block size
[19:33:32] <duuude> I think too many read/writes are bad for flash storage as well
[19:33:39] <jelly> duuude, then the best and simplest thing to do to make things faster is buy an SSD, if you can
[19:33:41] <Khepra> but it's not really clear cut, generic "alwys faster" situation. it may or may not be.
[19:34:11] <Khepra> !ssd limit
[19:34:11] <dpkg> In 2021 and beyond, you should not worry about wearing out your SSD unless you have a prehistoric SSD. If your use case is writing out hundreds of TB within several years (typical SSD endurance these days), then you likely have the means to use redundant arrays, hot standbys and have ensured data endurance. Therefore, writing out 10TB or 50TB more or less should be irrelevant for you.
[19:34:12] <duuude> jelly: I want to make life easier for people with hdd
[19:34:38] <duuude> not all flash storage is ssd

[20:57:01] <Khepra> ns12: it's not much different from freebsd pkg
[20:57:44] <Khepra> the "quarterly" is like debian stable, except it never changes  (except exceptions, and backported fixes); the head/master pkg repo, whatwasitcalled, is like debian sid.
[20:58:22] <Khepra> debian also has testing, which is rolling-release-like, similar to sid but less breaky. it's what will become next stable.
[20:59:20] <somiaj> it is rolling, but not released.
[20:59:32] <Khepra> the major difference between pkg quarterly and debian stable is guarantee, support level, longevity, backporting. freebsd quarterly is just a snapshot, which abruptly changes, with no "testing" inbetween, every 3 months.
[20:59:56] *** Quits: Misotauros (~Misotauro@gateway/vpn/pia/misotauros) (Ping timeout: 245 seconds)
[21:00:26] <Khepra> debian at least has the testing repo which freezes before it becomes next stable. the months long freeze ferrets out "release critical" bugs. something like this doesn't exist in freebsd pkgs or ports.
[21:00:51] <somiaj> ns12: Note, debian's stable policy is a point tension in lots of cases. Took quite a while to get updated firefox and chormium packages because they had to backport the build chain, which was annoying to lots of desktop users.
[21:01:09] *** Joins: blackout69 (~blackout6@net-31-156-75-167.cust.vodafonedsl.it)
[21:01:30] <somiaj> So though debian is fairly strict about following policy, this can cause security fixes and even grave bug fixes to be slow and not timely if the build tools need to be backported as well (since debian also wants to ensure everything in stable can be built with tools only in stable)
[21:01:41] <Khepra> but then at least on linux we have flatpaks and snaps, to mitigate these... contentious.... issues :)
[21:02:09] <somiaj> Khepra: yea, I like the release policy debian has, the testing freeze gives lots of time to ensure most stuff is going to work smooth.

[21:17:51] <Khepra> linux gaming is joke of jokes.
[21:18:28] <Khepra> valve and proton are superbly done but it's unfortunately the rest of linux "desktop oriented" ecosystem that's pure garbage. RIP Valve if they intend to base a business on that.
[21:20:58] <somiaj> I find it works fine if you either find games that have native linux clients (rare, but with steam getting better) or is well supported in wine/proton. Can't just paly anything though.
[21:21:11] <somiaj> But I think it is for the best (For me) that I can't just play anything, I'd be far less productive.
[21:21:12] *** Parts: vxwarlock (~Darkcodex@user/vxwarlock) (Closing Window)
[21:21:39] <Khepra> actually it's native games that are garbage, and their proton variants are superior.
