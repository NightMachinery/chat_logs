[00:11:38] <borodust> Jach: hmm, one of the reasons SIGILL is signalled (it is present in a backtrace you sent me) is a missing processor instruction
[00:13:45] <borodust> so my guess old processor is indeed the reason
[00:14:20] <borodust> AVX instructions were introduced in hardware around 2011
[00:14:57] <Jach> borodust: Yeah, 920. Not sure why my cpuinfo adds a 0.. but I definitely don't have AVX. It sounds like a plausible reason.

[23:02:22] <borodust> xDD
[23:02:58] * |3b| is first to join, yay :p
[23:03:07] <|3b|> not that i ever submit anything :(
[23:03:14] <borodust> noice! gonna give a shout out
[23:03:49] <mfiano> |3b|: think you did once a couple years ago
[23:04:07] <mfiano> that or my memory is far worse than i thought :)
[23:04:13] <|3b|> guessing i probably won't have enough of a UI lib done by then for the one game i've been wanting to make lately
[23:04:31] <mfiano> which is a contradictory statement if i ever saw one
[23:04:33] <|3b|> yeah, did one of the itch jams
[23:05:14] <|3b|> if you count "tap screen to increase score by 1, and it won't even remember the score right" as a game :)
[23:05:53] <mfiano> doesn't have to be a game, really. could be the part you finished/want to continue next jam/give users something to build on top of
[23:06:25] <mfiano> that's the goal anyway, which is why FOSS is a requirement...give newbies some code to play around with
[23:06:56] <technomancy> last jam I did a game where I didn't even really do much game design; it was 95% just my own implementation of an existing game
[23:07:14] <technomancy> nothing like cutting scope
[23:08:18] <|3b|> yeah, if i do anything it would just be a cheap clone :)
[23:14:01] <|3b|> hmm, apparently i've joined 13 lisp game jams on itch, more than i thought :)
[23:14:24] <technomancy> is that ... all of them?
[23:14:54] <|3b|> should be most of them, but might have missed some
[23:15:56] <technomancy> I started in 2018 and I've only done 7
[23:17:24] <|3b|> failing to find any way to search jams on itch :(
[23:19:18] <technomancy> https://itch.io/jam/january-2016-lisp-game-jam looks like this was the first one that was on itch afaict
[23:21:15] <|3b|> yeah, that's first one i joined. looks like i missed at least one, so at least 14 including next one
[23:25:46] <mfiano> nah definitely not all of them
[23:25:56] <mfiano> this is the 11th i hosted. pretty sure dto did more than 2 :)
[23:28:03] <mfiano> looks like this is 5 years since i started hosting them, wow
[23:28:07] <|3b|> updated wiki page with ones i know about
[23:28:11] <mfiano> bi-annually since autumn 2016
[23:28:55] <|3b|> 4 from dto et. al., one of which included mfiano in the al.
[23:29:32] <mfiano> https://itch.io/jam/spring-lisp-game-jam-2021 https://itch.io/jam/autumn-lisp-game-jam-2020 https://itch.io/jam/spring-lisp-game-jam-2020 https://itch.io/jam/autumn-lisp-game-jam-2019 https://itch.io/jam/lisp-game-jam-2019 https://itch.io/jam/autumn-lisp-game-jam-2018 https://itch.io/jam/lisp-game-jam-2018 https://itch.io/jam/lisp-game-jam-2017-hard-mode
[23:29:34] <mfiano> https://itch.io/jam/lisp-game-jam-2017-easy-mode https://itch.io/jam/autumn-2016-lisp-game-jam
[23:31:57] <mfiano> those are all the ones i know about because it only shows me the ones i hosted
[23:37:00] <mfiano> seems you got all of them
[23:38:11] <mfiano> dto: if you ever read this, can you paste the links for the game jams spanning from inception up to and including 2015? not sure if any are on your itch or whatever platform we used before
[23:41:53] <mfiano> ah looks like we just used github wiki to "register" in the past
[23:42:10] <mfiano> i guess there would be no links then
[23:50:20] <borodust> mfiano: what's the utc time for the jam? :D
[23:50:33] <mfiano> Same as always :)
[23:50:52] <mfiano> What does the countdown timer say for you?
[23:51:01] <borodust> itch.io most likely shows me my time, but i really would like not to scew it up in UTC
[23:51:10] <borodust> October 15th 2021 at 7:00 AM
[23:51:23] <borodust> *for an announcement
[23:52:22] <mfiano> It has always started at 12am EST (GMT -5) or 12am EDT (GMT -4, thank for the more confusion, DST)
[23:52:35] <mfiano> So that sounds right to me
[23:52:53] <mfiano> I have considered starting it at 12am UTC, but consistency won :)
[23:54:10] <|3b|> mouseover the times on game jam page and it shows UTC in tooltip
[23:54:29] <mfiano> ah very cool
[23:55:47] <borodust> ohhhh
[23:55:52] <borodust> thanks!)
[23:57:23] <mfiano> borodust: are you sure itch.io is using your correct timezone?
[23:58:37] <mfiano> oh nvm. that sounds riught
