[00:00:04] <pussipupu> I don't know if the imaginary people would have been sharing a bedroom
[00:00:31] <pussipupu> It's not my phrase after all
[00:01:11] <twb> I usually see Americans use it when they live in on-campus housing, where there's 2 people per bedroom (in separate beds), and everything else is communal
[00:01:58] <StayHungry> pussipupu: adding another pair of agreeable subject and verb does not solve semantic inconsistency. since roommate is 1 person, i see it intuitive to agree everything around that fact. :)
[00:02:30] <pussipupu> That's not how grammatical agreement works
[00:02:53] <pussipupu> And English doesn't have strict agreement between grammatical and semantic number
[00:03:20] <StayHungry> One big car, it is blue. Two small cars, they are red.
[00:03:21] <pussipupu> if you want to avoid singular "they" then that's pretty silly honestly, but knock yourself out
[00:03:22] <LjL> twb, "roommate" is definitely used in American English for people who *don't* share a room as well
[00:03:50] <twb> LjL: yeah I found it very confusing when I encountered that.
[00:05:19] <CuriosTiger> StayHungry: There are many ways to skin a cat. I'm fine with singular "their", but I'm not a fan of forcing new pronouns into the language.
[00:05:50] <twb> In any case, it doesn't matter what any single person here thinks
[00:09:45] <blkshp> EXCEPT ME!
[00:09:50] * blkshp giggles hilariously.
[00:15:37] <StayHungry> CuriosTiger: many programming languages, being a part of constructed languages, have concept of variables. something you could define as you like. for example, $lalafa = 'a pleasant sequence of notes'. but there are some words that could not be used as variable names, i.e. (re-)defined, because they are reserved for special things. for example, $var = '...' will throw an error. i like this concept because of immutability that gives 
[00:15:37] <StayHungry> predictability.
[00:15:47] * LuisP14 rules .. using his ruler
[00:16:01] <CuriosTiger> StayHungry: Human languages will never be immutable, though.
[00:16:29] <CuriosTiger> (Heck, programming languages aren't either. Look at C -- possibly the most conservative language out there. It changed significantly between K&H and ANSI99.)
[00:19:36] <pussipupu> Do you mean K&R?
[00:20:42] <StayHungry> CuriosTiger: i see pronouns as reserved words, they're crucial pointers, not a fleeting fashion. obviously, when they assign additional meaning (singular they) to what is already being defined (as plural), either there should be a convincing argument or it is 'filling the gap in haste (and let other generation sort that out'.
[00:20:53] <pussipupu> I don't know that C is exceptionally conservative to be fair, people still use languages which follow older standards
[00:21:26] <pussipupu> Singular "they" is about a hundred years older than singular "you"
[00:21:48] <StayHungry> pussipupu: but is it older then plural they?
[00:21:59] <CuriosTiger> Yes, I mean K&R. And yes, people still use languages that follow older standards, but C is kind of the grandfather. And it has changed far less than Perl, Python or PHP, or for that matter less than offshoots like C++, Objective-C or C#.
[00:22:13] <StayHungry> and it not, then why singular and plural are defined into one word?
[00:22:25] <StayHungry> 'just because', 'remember and use' are not enough
[00:22:47] <pussipupu> and has been used as a general epicene pronoun to varying degrees for that long
[00:23:50] <pussipupu> if thou followest that logic then thou needst to not use singular "you" either
[00:24:10] <StayHungry> sure
[00:24:15] <StayHungry> i started with that
[00:24:23] <StayHungry> with CuriousTiger :)
[00:24:30] <pussipupu> if it's simple preference, which it apparently is, then knock yourself out but don't make silly claims
[00:24:37] <pussipupu> And ultimately almost all language is "because"

[00:26:54] <LuisP14> ¯\_(o.o)_/¯
[00:26:56] <StayHungry> gap there is. otherwise eventually we would have fit everything into they (and omit he/she/it whatever).
[00:26:57] <CuriosTiger> the question was actually answered above
[00:27:09] <CuriosTiger> it grew out of the use of the plural in lieu of the singular as a polite form of address
[00:27:32] <CuriosTiger> Other Germanic languages do this too -- like German with Sie. But English took it to the next level.
[00:28:05] <LuisP14> yep, my commentary :P
[00:28:24] <CuriosTiger> You're not going to get mathematical precision out of languages, though. "just because" very frequently is all you're going to get, whether you consider that adequate or not.
[00:29:28] <StayHungry> CuriosTiger: not sure i can remember many such cases in other languages hence the particular emphasis 
[00:30:09] * LuisP14 demands they give him back his thou (whosoever this person is :P)
[00:30:22] <StayHungry> LuisP14: oh brother, where art thou :D
[00:32:33] * LuisP14 *wishful thinking*
[00:35:39] <StayHungry> i guess re-introduction of thou is complicated by the need to agree verbs in an unusual way, e.g. in the sentence 'if thou followest that logic then thou needst to...' we have followest and needst.

[05:13:19] <Samian> I'm looking it up now
[05:13:30] <toretto> What's the exact word that can be used here? "Max written that paper to ____ the inferiority complex of the people.", so the context is the people had some inferiority complex issue, and Max's paper help deal with that complex.
[05:13:39] <toretto> Which word fits this context?
[05:14:08] <toretto> deal in the sense, challange that complex and feel better.
[05:14:09] <Samian> off topic question, when you totally relax your eyes, do you get a double vision when looking at your computer screen?
[05:14:48] <LjL> arguably yes... looking towards infinity is probably a "relaxed" state
[05:15:09] <Samian> like if you close your eyes for 30 seconds and open them, does your computer screen appear as double vision ?
[05:15:33] <LjL> if it does so, it's so quick i barely notice
[05:15:41] <LjL> but i can willfully "relax" my eyes and obtain double vision
[05:15:49] <Samian> LjL  yes yes why is that I'm wondering. Looking toward infinity means both eye balls are perfectly parallel in direction
[05:17:33] <Samian> LjL  I had hard time explaining this to my optometrist. I'm getting prism glasses so I can have my eyes in a totally relaxed state and have no double vision when looking at the computer screen (while everything else further away is in double vision)
[05:17:44] <Samian> I'm just hoping that everything else being double vision won't irritate me
[05:18:05] <Samian> basically I'm getting special optical illusion glasses
[05:18:21] <toretto> you're high or somethin?
[05:18:41] <Samian> it will create the illusion that my computer monitor a foot away is a mile away on a giant theater screen
[05:19:19] <LjL> Samian, why are you getting such glasses? is your eyes being "not relaxed" necessarily a terrible thing? and also: if your eye alignment (i.e. whether they're parallel or converging) doesn't match the *focus* of the thing you're looking at, that will strain you
[05:19:26] <Samian> toretto  I'm a software engineer. Coding all day drives my eyes crazy :-(.. It's like having your eyes in a cross-eyed state for many hours
[05:19:47] <LjL> this happens with VR headsets for example: they make things appear like they are at different distances (convergence-wise), but the focus is at a fixed distance
[05:19:47] <Samian> naturally my eyes like looking at very distant objects. No double vision at all when relaxed.
[05:20:23] <LjL> Samian, if you get glasses, or any contraption, that makes your screen look like it's at infinity in the sense of convergence, then it should also make it look at infinity in the sense of focus
[05:20:35] <toretto> Samian: i'm a software engineer too, i stare at screens 16+ hours a day.
[05:21:49] <toretto> but anyway, does anyone know answer to my question?
[05:22:39] <LjL> toretto, tackle
[05:22:46] <LjL> bit of an informal word i guess
[05:23:04] <LjL> also "the inferiority complex of the people" sounds odd, i'd say "the/those people's inferiority complex"
[05:23:15] <LjL> or "address"
[05:23:26] <toretto> i see, so "address" or "tackle"
[05:24:12] <toretto> learning new words daily is fun.
[05:24:33] <Samian> LjL  well that's the thing.. when I totally relax my eyes, I get blur and I get double vision for close objects. The optometrist fixed the blur, but not the double vision. I went back to see the optometrist again today. I explained you can have the best eyesight in the world and you'll still always get double vision. (focusing on nearby object, causes far objects to double; focusing on far objects, causes near objects to double). I said when
[05:24:34] <Samian>  my eyes relax they are in the look-at-far-objects state.   Ljl but maybe, my irritation is due to just the blur. Maybe both eyes slightly crossed to focus on nearby objects appears to be a problem but really it isn't. 
[05:25:20] <Samian> toretto  "Max written" or "Max wrote" ?
[05:25:28] <LjL> toretto, your context sounds formal (at least that's my guess) so i'd lean towards "address". https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/address#Verb meaning 14, "(transitive, formal) To direct attention towards a problem or obstacle, in an attempt to resolve it."
[05:25:38] <toretto> Samian: drink a shit ton of water, that personally totally helps.
[05:25:40] <LjL> Max wrote
[05:25:42] <LjL> i didn't notice that
[05:25:47] <LjL> "Max written" is wrong
[05:25:54] <toretto> ah, yeah. "max wrote" :)
[05:26:00] <toretto> sorry for my grammar.
[05:26:11] <LjL> no need to apologize, that's what this channel is here for
[05:26:19] <toretto> :)
[05:27:08] <toretto> yeah, i guess "address" is what i was looking for.
[05:27:19] <toretto> thanks.
[05:27:47] <StayHungry> toretto: Max [has] written the paper [that makes] the inferiority complex [clear to] the people.
[05:29:17] <toretto> StayHungry: hmm, i guess that changes the meaning of what i was trying to say, isn't it?
[05:30:19] <toretto> my original meaning was, people had an inferiority complex in the first place, and to "address" that inferiority complex, Max has written the paper.
[05:31:34] <StayHungry> [get over]
[05:31:40] <toretto> so, i guess, in your sentence, you're saying that, people are confused about thair IC, so Max written that paper to make their IC clear to the people, who have difficulty understanding.
[05:31:52] <toretto> IC = inferiority complex
[05:32:47] <StayHungry> Max wrote that paper to help the people to get over the inferiority complex.
[05:33:29] <toretto> hmmm...i guess, "to get over" isn't what i want. i think "address" or "tackle" sounds something like that i was looking for though.

[06:55:24] <StayHungry> it's just there are no articles in my native language, so the whole concept is a bit confusing. for example, we meet at the bus stop. you ask me: what are you doing? i reply: waiting for _ tram. i tell the truth, but do not give the details, where any tram will do or a particular one (btw, articles in this sentence were written as felt, not as learnt). whereas in English i have to insert either the or a, which will make the answer 
[06:55:24] <StayHungry> too detailed.
[06:55:57] <StayHungry> *whether
[06:58:04] <LuisP14> the one specific tram that is expected to come :x
[06:58:46] <kurahaupo_> StayHungry: I'm a native speaker so I use articles automatically, but I find it really quite challenging to explain which ones and why
[06:59:39] <kurahaupo_> "waiting for a tram" is an acceptable answer; you're not obliged to say where you're going
[07:00:30] <StayHungry> kurahaupo_: yep, many papers on English articles opens the same :)) e.g. https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ903889.pdf Hewson  (1972,  p.132) has called the English article system a “psychomechanism”, through which native speakers use articles correctly but unconsciously. Since errors in the use of articles generally do not impede communication, many learners may feel that the effort involved in learning the system correctly 
[07:00:30] <StayHungry> is not proportionate to the benefits accrued (Master, 1997, p.216).
[07:00:34] <kurahaupo_> It differentiates from "just having a rest before I jog home" or "waiting for a taxi"

[07:24:03] <kurahaupo_> StayHungry: 99% of the time they make no practical difference. It's the other 1% that trips you up when you're not expecting it. Another option would be "I'm waiting for my99,99 bus."
[07:27:09] <StayHungry> 'having a rest before i jog home'. i recall first lessons with introduction of the core verbs such as to be and to have, long before all those perfect auxiliaries and modals of obligation. and i thought, why they were so obsessed with having things. e.g. not resting, but having a rest. 'i have, you have not, do envy!' then i stumbled upon a 1976 book by psychoanalyst Erich Fromm called 'To have or to be?' and things began to clear 
[07:27:09] <StayHungry> up. :D
[07:27:25] <kurahaupo_> Perhaps it might seem more sane if articles weren't taught separately, but rather as part of the determiners.
[07:27:25] <kurahaupo_> StayHungry: looking from the other direction, gender-marked nouns (in other languages) are equally as valueless to the learner.
[07:28:59] <kurahaupo_> English modal verbs behave very similarly to French ones, particularly do/be/have/go
[07:30:24] *** Quits: mud (~mud@user/kadoban) (Ping timeout: 272 seconds)
[07:30:58] <kurahaupo_> But I've been told that auxiliary verbs are more of a Germanic tradition.
[07:31:43] <StayHungry> gender-marked nouns? you mean something like author and authoress?
[07:34:46] <CuriosTiger> kurahaupo: Modern Romance languages uses them plenty too. Far more than Latin did, which makes me wonder if French and Italian borrowed them from German, Spanish from French etc.
[07:35:13] <CuriosTiger> especially given how many of them are direct calques between Romance and Germanic languages.

[21:09:32] <powermail> right
[21:09:33] <powermail> that's the issue
[21:09:41] <powermail> 'mobile' in this context

[21:12:21] <powermail> see the use of word 'mobile'
[21:13:47] <StayHungry> mobile... easy moving?
[21:15:28] <StayHungry> volatile?
[21:16:29] <StayHungry> yes, i guess it's the word you need

[21:19:57] <powermail> a passage from 1913
[21:20:27] <powermail> appears to be treating words like colorless, mobile, volatile together
[21:24:24] <StayHungry> subtle differences. mobile = easily moved (think of water that leaves a vessel almost without traces vs oil or even yogurt). volatile = unstable, evaporating readily.
[21:25:05] <StayHungry> google for 'volatile regions' to see non-chemistry examples.
[21:25:57] <StayHungry> e.g. volatile emotions, volatile stocks, volatile situation with rioters

[23:08:24] <StayHungry> CuriosTiger: have you checked ads filtering lists in use (of adblock, ublock, etc) about rokket.space? 
[23:08:28] <mdogg> arash: I've never heard the term "not unlikely" when describing something, but the term "not unlike" is used fairly often.  I would interperate "not unlikely" to mean likely.  Just as if I say, "Brian's management style is not unlike my own." - it would mean that his management style and mine have more similarities than differences.  
[23:09:18] <mdogg> However, "not unlikely" sounds strange to me, personally.  I'd go with "likely". 
[23:10:24] <CuriosTiger> StayHungry: It's a DNS issue.
[23:10:43] <CuriosTiger> StayHungry: According to the gTLD servers for .space, you have two authoritative servers for rokket.space.
[23:10:54] <CuriosTiger> peterbilt:~ stian$ dig @rose.ns.cloudflare.com. s3.rocket.space. A +short
[23:10:54] <CuriosTiger> peterbilt:~ stian$ dig @norman.ns.cloudflare.com. s3.rocket.space. A +short
[23:10:54] <CuriosTiger> peterbilt:~ stian$ 
[23:11:04] <CuriosTiger> As you can see, neither of them returns an A record when queried.
[23:13:34] <mdogg> I show an A-record pointing to 136.243.18.162 for rokket.space
[23:13:41] <mdogg> https://dnschecker.org/all-dns-records-of-domain.php?query=rokket.space&rtype=ALL&dns=cloudflare
[23:14:34] <CuriosTiger> Then it's possible that Cloudflare doesn't like traffic from my network (Comcast Business.) I do get a response, though. The response just doesn't contain any A records.
[23:15:07] <mdogg> I have Comcast too, but I use Cloudflare DNS servers.
[23:15:29] <CuriosTiger> I'm using 9.9.9.9 as my DNS server usually, but as you can see from my dig commands, I was querying the authoritative servers directly.
[23:15:43] <mdogg> Yeah that's werid.
[23:15:49] <mdogg> Who's DNS is 9.9.9.9?
[23:16:13] <StayHungry> quad9, it's a reliable one
[23:16:17] <CuriosTiger> Quad9
[23:16:17] <mdogg> Cool
[23:16:22] <StayHungry> and it works via quad9 on my end
[23:16:48] <StayHungry> that's why i offered CuriousTiger to check for blocking filters
[23:16:53] <CuriosTiger> https://dnsmap.io/#A/s3.rokket.space shows different IPs in different locations, so it seems he's using Cloudflare's CDN to speed performance.
[23:16:55] <mdogg> If I could I'd drop Comcast but I have no other option.  So at least I don't have to use their DNS. 
[23:17:02] <CuriosTiger> however, I usually don't have trouble connecting to cloudflare-hosted sites.
[23:17:20] <CuriosTiger> mdogg: Yeah, their DNS servers used to direct you to spam pages for non-existent domains, thus breaking DNS.
[23:17:41] <CuriosTiger> I think they finally got a clue, but I don't use Comcast DNS simply because they used to pull that slimy trick.
[23:17:57] <StayHungry> check this https://tools.keycdn.com/traceroute
[23:18:02] <mdogg> Yep.  I really can't stand them.  Cloudflare is wonderful, though.  They host two of my sites and their tools and service is outstanding.
[23:18:06] <StayHungry> it's a multi-traceroute from 10 places
[23:18:19] <mdogg> Sorry, not host - they are the registrar of two of them.

[23:42:41] <CuriosTiger> None of them are. I can reach the IP just fine. I just -- predictably -- get an error page from the web server because it doesn't know which site I want. This is a DNS issue, not a connectivity issue. But I won't troubleshoot further in here, per the conversation above.
