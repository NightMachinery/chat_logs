[06:54:52] <znf> For some it's 5am in the morning
[06:55:09] <sprog> Is it 5am for you?
[06:55:22] <znf> For me, yes

[06:58:10] <AMM> Probably looking for T8 2mm pitch+lead leadscrews from within EU for his 3D printer, as we all tend to do
[06:58:33] <sprog> yes, very common and relatable, of course
[06:59:33] <sprog> While you're here, do you think you can help me with creating a command? Im extremely new to ffmpeg and have no idea where to begin
[06:59:50] <AMM> Nope
[07:00:01] <AMM> Instead of asking to ask you should just ask, though
[07:00:27] <AMM> Few care for stories, just say what you're trying to do, how you're going about it, what your input and outputs are, etc
[07:00:32] <AMM> Ie. ask.
[07:02:07] <sprog> How do I up the volume of one audio track without touching the other tracks as well as keep the subtitles?  Also, since there's a few episodes, is it possible to do batch conversions?

[07:14:36] <sprog> That's great. How would I be able to do that?
[07:15:34] <znf> Here's a good starting point: https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/AudioVolume
[07:15:59] <znf> More info on that filter: http://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-filters.html#volume
[07:16:59] <sprog> thanks for the links!
[07:17:50] <znf> Just so you know - filters require re-encoding.
[07:18:34] <znf> And unless your input is some lossless format, re-encoding will lose quality
[07:18:45] <sprog> darn
[07:20:05] <znf> I'm not sure on what your input container/formats are, but you could look into replay gain
[07:21:05] <znf> granted, I've no idea if all, or any, for that matter, video players actually look at replay gain tags
[07:21:29] <sprog> I've got MKV
[07:22:11] <AMM> mpv does but iirc it may not be enabled by default; you're much better off reencoding the audio with the volume filter
[07:25:28] <sprog> I'm sorry, iirc?
[07:25:30] <znf> You'll also need to map the remaining audio tracks that you're not touching back into the final output
[07:25:46] <znf> https://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=160376&s=8636f2a6377d29d6a5f8af331371b9a2
[07:26:24] <sprog> Ha, thank you
[07:27:14] <sprog> This is probably a lot to ask, but if you're able, could you show me an example of a command, like a template I could use?
[07:28:06] <znf> Honestly, I don't think that will serve you in the short term. If you're just starting out with ffmpeg, it's kind of trying to run before you can even crawl
[07:29:34] <sprog> I agree with that logic, but the reason I ask is because it's really a one time use
[07:32:53] <znf> but, and this is just me dry-coding: ffmpeg -i file.mkv -filter_complex '[0:a:1] volume=1.5 [audio]' -vcodec copy -scodec copy -copy_unknown -map '[audio]' -c:a whateverCodecYouNeed -q:a whateverBitRateOfCodec -map '[0:a:FOO'] (...repeat) out.mkv
[07:33:07] <znf> where FOO are the remaining audio tracks that you just need copying
[07:33:24] <znf> oh, and you also need to specify copy for the rest of the codecs, I believe
[07:34:14] <znf> ie: if you need to copy 2nd track (and beyond), -map '[0:a:2]' -c:a copy -map '[0:a:3]' -c:a copy
[07:34:15] <znf> etc
[07:34:45] <znf> other than that, there's also ways to target audio streams by language, if your file has the correct meta-data
[07:35:08] <znf> again, crawl before run, it's not a simple task for someone who has never touched ffmpeg before
[07:36:39] <sprog> My god, it's Chinese. Regardless, it means a lot for you to have done that, so thank you!
[07:37:46] <znf> Yup, told you
[07:38:08] <znf> Maybe try handbrake instead
[07:38:17] <znf> Although I've no idea if it can do that
[07:38:51] <sprog> Maybe handbrake is the way to go, but I was under the impression that you couldn't isolate an audio track and increase its volume while also keeping the subtitles
[07:40:41] <znf> I wouldn't know :)
[07:40:56] <znf> There's also the option to do it in two steps
[07:41:18] <sprog> Really? What option might that be?
[07:41:48] <znf> Copy the stream to another file with the filter, then remux it back in the container, replacing the original
[07:42:19] <sprog> I'll try and find out what that means. Thanks for the hints!
[07:43:21] <znf> ie: ffmpeg -i in.mkv -filter_complex '[0:a:X] volume=1.5 [audio]' -map '[audio]' -c:a flac audio.mka
[07:43:33] <znf> then you'd have your amplified audio in audio.mka
[07:44:03] <znf> and then just use something like mkvmerge (or you can just use ffmpeg, but you can see it's not that easy to do it when you work with multiple streams on the CLI)

[07:46:29] <sprog> is the X in 0:a:X a place holder for something else or is it actually just X
[07:46:40] <znf> https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/Map
[07:46:46] <znf> Read this
[07:48:01] <znf> It's a placeholder, you'll need to select the proper audio stream you're targeting
[07:49:16] <sprog> The diagram is throwing me off, but I'll try and figure it out
[07:50:19] <znf> Run ffmpeg -i on your file (or ffprobe) and it will make more sense
[07:54:24] <sprog> Heres an example of what came up
[07:54:24] <sprog>  Stream #0:1(eng): Audio: vorbis, 48000 Hz, stereo, fltp (default)
[07:54:44] <znf> if that's all there is, that looks like there's just 1 audio stream
[07:55:04] <sprog> Well theres two, I just selected a portion
[07:55:15] <sprog>  Stream #0:2(jpn): Audio: vorbis, 48000 Hz, stereo, fltp
[07:55:20] <sprog> thats the other one
[07:55:47] <sprog> I'm not sure how to add the 0:1 into the command
[07:56:10] <znf> 0:a:1
[07:56:26] <znf> 0:a:eng can probably work too
[07:56:29] <znf> Not sutee
[07:56:31] <znf> Sure
[07:56:44] <sprog> let me try
[07:56:54] <znf> 0 is the input number (you only input one file)
[07:57:19] <znf> a stands for audio stream (as opposed to subtitle or video)
[07:57:31] <znf> then a:1 just says audio stream 1
[07:58:22] <sprog> hm
[07:58:38] <sprog>  No such filter: '[0:a:1]'
[07:58:42] <sprog> strange
[07:58:57] <sprog> Error initializing complex filters. Invalid argument
[08:01:57] <znf> You didn't copy something right
[08:02:07] <sprog> let me show you my command
[08:02:20] <znf> You might need to use " on windows
[08:02:25] <znf> Instead of '
[08:04:47] <znf> or, technically, you could just do without them and no spaces in the filter, no idea how windows interprets them :P
[08:04:57] <sprog> Success!
[08:05:03] <sprog> The quotations were the problem
[08:05:33] <sprog> and the 0:a:1 gave me the japanese audio, so putting a 0 fixed that

[13:11:42] <clandmeter> hi, im trying to build ffmpeg on riscv64, but it seems the major number is not append to the libs. resulting in something like this https://tpaste.us/NMv6
[13:14:14] <JEEB> is that under your --prefix?
[13:15:28] <JEEB> also see under ffbuild/config.log
[13:15:40] <JEEB> there should be references to SHFLAGS and -soname
[13:18:22] <JEEB> configure script should be generating the SHFLAGS and then they should get utilized during linking I'd expect
[13:18:38] *** Quits: toretto (~0xe3b7@45.15.16.60) (Ping timeout: 268 seconds)
[13:19:03] <JEEB> `make V=1` etc should list what's getting utilized. you could poke something a la `libavformat/movenc.c` and then `make V=1` the libavformat linking

[15:46:23] <clandmeter> JEEB: no that was after our build scripts moves it to our pkgdir location. but the so files have the same issue in the origin directories.
[15:46:28] <clandmeter> SHFLAGS='-shared -Wl,-soname,$$(@F)'
[15:47:05] <JEEB> yes that's the default
[15:47:25] <clandmeter> it seems to be arch depended, other arches do not show this behaviour
[15:47:49] <JEEB> it shouldn't be, it's more OS dependant if anything
[15:48:02] <JEEB> thus I recommend checking when you run the configure script, what you end up with
[15:48:17] <clandmeter> the configure script is same for all our arches
[15:48:24] <clandmeter> i mean our build script
[15:48:25] <JEEB> ffbuild/config.log should output something, and as I said `make V=1` then outputs the exact commands utilized
[15:49:42] <JEEB> clandmeter: I'm expecting either a shell problem, or something else funky due to whatever build framework or whatever is being utilized. which is why I recommended checking the things I just re-mentioned in the previous line
[15:49:49] <JEEB> so just to figure things out
[15:49:57] <clandmeter> nod
[15:50:49] <clandmeter> it could be related to qemu
[15:50:57] <clandmeter> qemu user
[15:51:47] <clandmeter> we have seen other script issues with argv[0] beeing qemu
[15:52:07] <JEEB> `mkdir -p riscv_build && cd riscv_build && ../configure --disable-autodetect && make V=1` should give a way to debug it within whatever you're building within
[15:52:16] <JEEB> (in the FFmpeg source dir)
[15:52:41] <JEEB> anyways, afk for most of the day now :)
[15:53:08] <clandmeter> ok, thx
[16:02:05] <clandmeter> ah i think i found it
[16:02:32] <clandmeter> no shebang in ffbuild/libversion.sh
