[02:50:54] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: I don't have any testcases handy on /Lorem, I think, but I'm fairly sure cross-page popup links to a div or section just pop up the entire page - that's how the new #tag-top works at all, I think.
[02:52:10] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: It's been like that from the start
[02:52:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: What do you think it should be, then? Nearest graf-lvl block?
[02:52:41] <gwern> I thought so... felt like it'd been that for a while but I wasn't sure if it was bad or not
[02:53:07] <Obormot\Arcturus> Well, I can change it, sure
[02:53:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> I'll take a look at it later tonight
[02:53:35] <gwern> I think maybe it would make most sense to just pop up the entire page. it's not like you need to 'load more' to do so. if that's not a good idea (because it'd make the scroll bar less useful?), section level at least and jump to the anchor
[02:53:51] <Obormot\Arcturus> It for sure is a bad idea to pop up the whole page
[02:54:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> Performance is worse, slower load, and yes, scroll bar less useful
[02:54:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> Section level, eh. Ok, I'll see what I can do
[02:54:42] <gwern> I think this may be an issue with the WP section links too - no good way to break out of the narrowing
[02:55:06] <gwern> I've been getting irritated with providing a nice precise WP link to the section dealing with the claim, and then getting 'trapped'
[02:56:36] <gwern> like in https://www.gwern.net/Collecting#signaling-gone-haywire - great, nice sharp link to the bowerbird collecting behavior I am satirizing, but then what if I want to read the rest? I have to do a live popup (how do I know 'Courtship' will even take me to the full WP article?) and now I read the shitty version?
[02:56:37] <Robomot> What Is The Collecting Mindset? ¬∑ Gwern.net [Signaling Gone Haywire This Satin bowerbird has a deep appreciation of blue esthetics & the role of plastic in post-WWII Australian history, and fond childhood memories collecting trash with his father. Here is one evolutionary psychology story we could tell to explain collecting: collecting is a pathological extreme of ordinary social sexually-selected behavior ‚Ä¶]
[02:58:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: That's a bigger fix, though. We don't really have any code right now to render a whole WP page as local content, just a section
[02:58:15] <gwern> (whereas if I had been derelict in linking and just linked to 'bowerbird' the reader can read the whole article in our beautiful WP popup presentation)
[02:58:25] <Obormot\Arcturus> But it's doable, of course
[02:58:31] <Obormot\Arcturus> I'll add it to the list
[02:58:59] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: btw any feedback on reader mode??
[02:59:00] <gwern> hm, that's true, our WP popups actually just render the *intro*, not the whole article, right?
[02:59:04] <Obormot\Arcturus> Right
[02:59:29] <gwern> ok so yeah that's a completely different thing from the within-page popups where we can render the whole page easily, we just don't
[02:59:49] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yep
[02:59:53] <gwern> the API does return all the sections if you ask, so shouldn't be too hard...
[03:00:02] <Obormot\Arcturus> Oh yeah, it's absolutely a thing we *can* do
[03:00:08] <gwern> maybe a lazy load approach? scroll to the bottom, then it requests the rest
[03:00:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> uhh
[03:00:30] <Obormot\Arcturus> Provisional thumbs down on that
[03:00:48] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: believe it or not, no feedback whatsoever other than some upvotes/likes. people have even commented on the new clippy! (negatively) but not reader-mode
[03:00:57] <Obormot\Arcturus> wow.
[03:01:01] <gwern> inorite
[03:01:14] <gwern> does it... just work so perfectly people can't even notice?
[03:01:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> Shit
[03:01:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> Maybe we should add some bugs
[03:01:57] <Obormot\Arcturus> To generate discussion
[03:02:07] <Obormot\Arcturus> And then "fix" those bugs quickly
[03:02:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> For upvotes and likes
[03:02:46] <gwern> I am hesitant to do that because you know people won't report bugs
[03:03:40] <Obormot\Arcturus> Sockpuppet accounts to report the bugs
[03:04:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yeah I dunno, I guess it's fine...

[03:47:51] <gwern> ok, it looks like most of the post-lenin burial were cremations (to save space, presumably) but no mention is made of cremating stalin's embalmed body so he presumably got a full regular tomb in the necropolis, and that's where his body is now, with a fairly modest tomb marker: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Stalin_(16114382579).jpg

[04:00:16] <gwern> in any case, anything is justified to fight covid!
[04:00:30] <saturn2> you could have the filter to the side or bottom and the rest transparent
[04:00:32] <kuudes> most would not die to covid then indeed
[04:00:49] <gurkenglas> and then you could make the filter fake so it's easier to wear
[04:00:53] <kuudes> saturn2, yeah. some sort of helmet I guess
[04:01:17] <kuudes> but with no filter, you could just not wear a mask or wear a visor or something?
[04:01:18] <ggreer> gurkenglas: that's what I did after getting vaccinated
[04:01:36] <ggreer> much easier to be understood when you're wearing a useless mask
[04:02:26] <Dyo> plexiglas mask w filter cartridge
[04:02:27] <gurkenglas> kuudes: it has to look like a filter, to pass the mask requirements.
[04:02:31] <kuudes> I wore a visor at the time surgical masks were recommended but now I only wear ffp3s because they work and are cheap
[04:02:57] <kuudes> gurkenglas, so you don't want to be protected?
[04:03:32] <gurkenglas> i'm not actually planning to do this, but it's fun to defeat cryptography
[04:03:50] <kuudes> ... I did not know masks are cryptographic
[04:04:00] <kuudes> is this related to 5g?
[04:05:14] <gurkenglas> no but there's a humorous link here to masks making it impossible to understand you
[04:05:40] <saturn2> i've seen someone wearing a mask with a hole cut out over the mouth
[04:05:52] <gurkenglas> what a chad
[04:06:35] <gwern> are you sure that wasn't a robber
[04:07:14] <saturn2> no
[04:07:26] <saturn2> anyone could be a robber
[04:08:15] <gwern> you're not a robber if you don't wear a ski mask with the mouth cutout and carry banker bags with '$' on them. everyone knows that
[04:08:40] <saturn2> it was a surgical mask
[04:08:55] <gwern> oh, then he was a doctor, so it must've been safe
[04:09:16] <kuudes> XD
[04:09:54] <gurkenglas> a surgeon. i think you're disproportionally likely to die next to those
[04:10:27] <gwern> that's just a correlation. and we all know correlation!=causation
[04:11:05] <gurkenglas> ask a doctor whether a surgeon cutting a hole in his mask would be likely to cause your death
[04:11:58] <kuudes> if he stabs you with the scalpel in a bank while next to a robber, that sounds likely
[04:12:27] <kuudes> but do you then know if you were the robber? you were next to the surgeon yourself
[04:13:05] <kuudes> maybe the true robber was inside our surgeon all along
[04:13:27] <Betawolf> they do often take things out of people
[04:13:30] <gurkenglas> are we sure this is not #lw-gpt
[04:14:11] <gwern> Betawolf: and the surgical bills!
[04:14:50] <gurkenglas> phew, if it were you would have replied "no. anyone could be #lw-gpt"
[04:14:59] <Betawolf> the bastards will steal your appendix and charge you for the privilege
[04:15:44] <Betawolf> they even have their own thieve's cant
[04:15:49] <kuudes> if you paint a $ on your appendix, will you become a robber?
[04:16:11] <kuudes> better yet, will you become a surgeon
[04:16:19] <Betawolf> all this -ectomy and funny Latin.

[07:06:10] <PapuaHardyNet> gwern: maybe ask nshepperd or Rivers or jdp to make you an AI generated clippy artwork. Hell, pay them. Even better, find a danbooru artist you like, commission them. (honestly I was waiting for you to get feedback from others before I say this, because I was pretty sure that if you found that fire clippy image appropriate for *your website*, you wouldn't listen to what I say)
[07:06:20] <gwern> PapuaHardyNet: I already asked rivers and it didn't work
[07:06:56] <gwern> well, it's certainly not in the usual gwern.net style but I thought it was in the spirit of clippy and cheesy '90s stuff like _Doom_ and "it really whips the llama's ass"
[07:07:23] <PapuaHardyNet> (rivers: "lol f u gwern pay me" gwern: "uhhh sure how much" rivers: "5000$ for a CLIP generation, 10k$ for a disco" gwern: "... let me get back to you on that")
[07:07:55] <gwern> PapuaHardyNet: the results were really bad. I'm not sure $100 or $200 is going to move the needle and make rivers suddenly figure out how to make clippy work
[07:09:07] <PapuaHardyNet> commission artists you like on danbooru? seriously there are great artists out there who are relatively unknown and make amazing art and would love to be paid and featured on a website like yours.
[07:09:15] <PapuaHardyNet> 200$ would go a *long way* with them
[07:09:44] <gwern> I don't have any 'evil clippy' in mind I'd pay $200 for
[07:10:07] <gwern> like, what is this much more awesome evil clippy you have in mind?
[07:10:59] <PapuaHardyNet> a dark background with some lighting overhead casting a shadow of a clippy on the floor, with glowing red eyes, and some light reflected off of the metal
[07:11:33] <PapuaHardyNet> the clippy stares at the viewer. There's nothing else in the image, just nothingness, just the clippy, and he's coming for you.
[07:11:43] <gwern> what style?
[07:11:51] <PapuaHardyNet> 3DCG
[07:12:05] <gwern> that's pretty vague. maybe, what game?
[07:13:18] <PapuaHardyNet> hmm. it could be cel-shaded like Dishonored, I like that. It could be "photorealistic" - realistic but also not, like ilya_kuvshinov_(style) and wlop and ilya_kuvshinov
[07:13:30] <PapuaHardyNet> look, a LOT of the impact of an image comes from lighting
[07:13:37] <PapuaHardyNet> and shading
[07:15:23] <gwern> (which is part of what would make it hard to commission)

[07:26:11] <PapuaHardyNet> use "paperclip" not "clippy"
[07:27:04] <gwern> it sorta knows clippy. the bottom right is clearly MS Clippit/Clippy. and in RiversHaveWings's samples, it was also clearly it. it was just bad

[07:32:46] <gwern> and the results tbh still wouldn't be that great. for abstract impressionist, I think the best AI works right now can pass on their own without needing a 'ah, but did you know an *AI* made this?' bit of affirmative action, but not anything intended to be sharp CGI esque

[08:08:51] <PapuaHardyNet> perhaps wolves is the wrong word - but they sure as hell are less naive, more socially adept, competent, and *ruthless* in pursuit of what they want.
[08:10:44] <PapuaHardyNet> EA isn't a core feature of their identity. And their social circle isn't majorly composed of EAs, even if they have power and influence in the EA community. Their goal is to *make things happen* which has a significantly higher weight than say, other goals

[09:24:02] <Obormot\Arcturus> Meanwhile, today, another addition to my list of "food products which you don't ever need to buy because it's so easy to make them at home, and more effective also": brown sugar
[09:24:15] <PapuaHardyNet> isn't sugar bad for your health
[09:24:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> Because brown sugar is what? White sugar plus molasses! Light brown sugar is white sugar with Some Molasses. Dark brown sugar is white sugar with More Molasses Than That.
[09:24:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> Well, and who is stopping you from simply *adding molasses to white sugar* yourself?? No one!
[09:25:07] <adiabatic> PapuaHardyNet: yes
[09:25:36] <Obormot\Arcturus> You can add some and get light brown, or add more and get dark brown... you can even use cool stuff like pomegranate molasses (available in Middle Eastern delis) to make the sugar have a nice tangy flavor...
[09:25:56] <Obormot\Arcturus> PapuaHardyNet: But it goes into cookies and other stuff, which are good for your spiritual health
[09:26:34] <adiabatic> PapuaHardyNet: the solution is to have sugar only for mindblowingly delicious things, and rarely
[09:27:01] <Obormot\Arcturus> (But what if your brown sugar dries out and gets hard? Why you just ADD MORE MOLASSES)
[09:27:16] <Obormot\Arcturus> (But also, if you're making at home, just make however much you need!)
[09:27:27] <adiabatic> mine did that to me and I just chipped away at it with a spoon
[09:27:33] <adiabatic> I kept wondering if there was a better idea
[09:27:52] <adiabatic> if I smashed the bag with a meat tenderizer I'd worry about putting a hole in the bag
[09:27:59] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yes it is Add More Molasses
[09:28:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> I have done this and it works.
[09:28:35] <adiabatic> what do I use molasses for otherwise, assuming I'm not making a Schadenfreude Pie?
[09:28:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> Nothing
[09:29:09] <Obormot\Arcturus> Well, add it to stuff
[09:29:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> Like the yeasted pumpkin bread recipe. Instead of maple syrup I put honey + pomegranate molasses
[09:29:42] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Just make sure not to buy "blackstrap molasses", which are fake)
[09:29:59] <adiabatic> I have a shitload of honey, though. If I'm gonna keep sugar sludge around, I need to churn through that.
[09:31:02] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yes that's what I'
[09:31:10] <Obormot\Arcturus> I'm saying: you can combine
[09:31:33] <Obormot\Arcturus> (But also, just make brown sugar with it, and otherwise keep it. It won't go bad)
[09:32:06] <adiabatic> Well, they're interesting honeys. I wouldn't want to mask them with molasses. Hell, the avocado honey is surprisingly molasses-like in that it's both strongly flavored yet very flat and uninteresting as a flavor, which‚Ä¶makes it interesting
[09:34:19] <Obormot\Arcturus> I tried to google the honey I use, but it's too exotic, I guess
[09:34:52] <Obormot\Arcturus> Ah, here's the other honey I use: https://healthywithhoney.com/bashkir-honey-the-most-expensive-honey-in-the-world-food-for-astronauts/
[09:34:54] <Robomot> Bashkir honey, the most expensive honey in the world, food for astronauts! (Would you give $223 for a kilo of honey? Coming from Russia, Bashkir honey is considered to be the best honey in the world. And the most expensive. In the post about antioxidants in honey I was mentioning Bashkir honey as a type of honey given as part of the daily meals to astronauts and deep-sea divers. It is)
[09:35:40] <adiabatic> $100/lb? shiiiiit
[09:36:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> (It's much cheaper here in Brooklyn)
[09:38:07] <Obormot\Arcturus> Aha, the other kind: https://amishhoney.com/imported-honey/altay-linden-honey-2lb

[09:38:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Again, cheaper here)
[09:38:28] <adiabatic> ‚Ä¶Russian amish?
[09:39:10] <Obormot\Arcturus> Some Russian distributor had this bizarre idea to market shit as "Amish"
[09:39:10] <adiabatic> Looks delicious.
[09:39:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> Russian supermarkets here sell "Amish" sour cream, etc.
[09:39:42] <Obormot\Arcturus> Of course none of it has anything whatsoever to do with the actual Amish
[09:39:44] <PapuaHardyNet> what is a "russian" supermarket in Brooklyn
[09:39:45] <adiabatic> it's not the stupidest branding trick
[09:39:57] <Obormot\Arcturus> PapuaHardyNet: It's... exactly what it sounds like
[09:40:15] <Obormot\Arcturus> Owned by ~Russians, sells ~Russian food products

[13:24:43] <feep[work]> yesterday I was severely sleep deprived, and I was able to do my job with little issue
[13:25:05] <feep[work]> I occasionally napped off, then I did a focused hour of good code work
[13:25:19] <PapuaHardyNet> That was my takeaway too
[13:25:28] <feep[work]> sure, I believe it impairs ability to pay sustained attention to uninteresting things ... who cares?
[13:25:46] <feep[work]> I didn't have much of that to begin with.
[13:27:01] <capisce> I'm more worried about the impact of sleep deprivation on metabolic health
[13:27:37] <PapuaHardyNet> in simpler terms, do you mean sleep deprivation will make you fat?
[13:27:42] <capisce> yep
[13:27:50] <feep[work]> seems to match my experience
[13:27:56] <feep[work]> but it's a constant additive factor.
[13:28:08] <PapuaHardyNet> really? that's scary.
[13:28:10] <feep[work]> the hilarious hot-take version of it is that "sleep is free not eating time"
[13:28:28] <feep[work]> ie. you don't need to expend any effort to not eat when you're literally paralyzed
[13:28:36] <PapuaHardyNet> lol
[13:28:39] <dbohdan|phone> My driving skills degrade more noticeably than anything else when sleep-deprived
[13:28:47] <feep[work]> that's also very plausible
[13:28:56] <PapuaHardyNet> Oh yeah that's a real thing. Even guzey says he doesn't risk driving when sleep deprived
[13:33:48] <feep[work]> (my sleep pattern is low sleep during the week, stupidly long sleep on the weekends, fwiw)
[13:34:02] <dbohdan|phone> (I'm afraid I'll have trouble driving once I am back on my feet because of the meningitis I've had. I need to test my reaction times. Sadly, I have no healthy refence. My vision has definitely suffered.)
[13:34:19] <feep[work]> well, drive slow to compensate
[13:35:04] <dbohdan|phone> Definitely. You pretty much have to with the potholes we have.
[13:44:40] <kuudes> feep[work], iirc the sleep-is-not-eating-time has indeed been seriously proposed as biological reason for sleep
[13:44:57] <feep[work]> .... really??
[13:45:00] <kuudes> can your mother drive btw?
[13:45:03] <kuudes> feep[work], yes really
[13:45:06] <feep[work]> wtf hahaha
[13:45:15] <feep[work]> oh nature, u so wacky
[13:45:47] <dbohdan|phone> kuudes: Yes, she can
[13:45:53] <kuudes> great
[13:46:13] <dbohdan|phone> This would be a very disappointing explanation for sleep
[13:47:20] <kuudes> organisms get more bang for their fuck-eat time if they hibernate over the cooler period on shadow side of the planet...
[13:53:06] <dbohdan|phone> But I want it to be about cool brain stuff like memory consolidation!
[13:55:27] <feep[work]> it'd be hilarious if dreams are just what brains do if you shut off their sensor/motor connections
[13:56:57] <kuudes> dbohdan|phone, do you have modafinil and would it help you currently btw?
[13:58:41] <dbohdan|phone> feep[work]: You keep making it worse
[13:59:23] <dbohdan|phone> kuudes: I couldn't find it here when I tried. I am not sure. I doubt it would help.
[14:00:32] <kuudes> I mean, if you go on the run with some plan and some possible fixed length, I wonder if it would be beneficial to have uppers for the duration of travel
[14:01:28] <kuudes> they have obvious true costs to health, but I wonder if that would still be net useful
[14:02:14] <kuudes> but you have also heart conditions, so you would need to make a good calculation so that you don't die in either case
[14:11:40] <dbohdan|phone> I have at least two alternatives to classic uppers like caffeine that are safe for my heart: Mildronate and Ceraxone. The latter is the only drug I have found that feels like it substitutes for sleep.

[18:35:55] <gwern> damn, this is not even the only amylin analogue in trials
[18:36:02] <gwern> wow, we're really finally going to do it and solve obesity
[18:43:26] <two2thehead> gwern, what's the tl;dr?
[18:43:46] <dTal> it means "too long, didn't read"
[18:43:54] <gwern> amylin and glutide drugs stack, and easily get 15% total weight loss

[18:44:16] <RiversHaveWings> i wonder if they have long term bad effects...
[18:44:53] <gwern> since they operate through directly modifying the hormones in appetite, they look pretty clean mechanistically. nothing like 2dnp, say
[18:45:02] <gwern> and all the side-effects so far look pretty minimal
[18:45:27] <gwern> no way to know but to roll it out as fast as possible to all the people already dying of the long term bad effects of obesity
[18:45:54] <gwern> (the sooner we know, the sooner we can get started on other amylin and glutide analogues which avoid the side-effects)
[18:48:50] <nshepperd> RiversHaveWings: :(
[18:51:27] <nshepperd> apparently the system here in Australia for getting stuff on the public health service mainly requires someone sufficiently autistic to fill out a massive form listing sources for why something is worth using
[18:51:52] <nshepperd> was wondering recently if that would be doable for semaglutide
[18:52:21] <nshepperd> its actually already subsidized, but as a diabetes drug
[18:53:27] <nshepperd> seems to be evidence that it would be a good idea for obesity given the massive costs
[18:54:26] <gwern> the downside is it's still a weekly injection... I don't know if you can do it yourself. you're T1D iirc so I guess needles don't faze you for even a second
[18:54:51] <nshepperd> subcutaneous injections are ez
[18:55:04] <gwern> 'git gud bro'
[18:55:23] <nshepperd> git gud and git cut
[18:56:50] <gwern> do u even pinch bro
[19:01:38] <nshepperd> if it's a choice between futilely attempting caloric restriction and an injection I'll take the injection hands down
[19:02:55] <nshepperd> wasn't there something about a form that you spray up your nose though
[19:03:34] <nshepperd> for semaglutide
[19:04:46] <gwern> I don't remember a nasal form, just oral. haven't heard any news about that lately, so it's still in the pipeline somewhere
[19:06:57] <nshepperd> hm maybe i had it confused with something else
[19:08:14] <nshepperd> oh there's an oral form though
[19:08:20] <nshepperd> huh that's weird

[19:26:31] <gwern> if you grew up without guilt about copyright and 'primary source' instilled in you, linking to the doomed original would strike you as being as sensible as linking to the front page of a blog when you are discussing a specific post
[19:26:38] <Obormot\Arcturus> Not sure I agree, tbh

[19:28:55] *** Quits: voltage_ (voltage@user/voltage) (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
[19:29:00] <Obormot\Arcturus> My point is, the concern here is not copyright or primary-sourceness; the concern is the conversation between bloggers/authors, the intellectual community
[19:29:10] <Obormot\Arcturus> Linking to the original is participation in that
[19:29:16] <gwern> (anyway, this comment probably shouldn't do that because they have chosen to use an unreliable mirror. I would never trust archive.[a-z][a-z] to be around longterm)
[19:29:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> Linking to an archive... not so much
[19:29:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> (But yes I agree)
[19:30:21] <feep[work]> eee
[19:30:49] <feep[work]> the more I mess with this, the more I think I've just found the objectively correct way to write serializers
[19:31:10] <gwern> the update part is a bit lost already. lots of blogs already lock comments after a short period. and the ones that don't may have a similar effect one the spammers show up. that's why I have a something like 90-day delay before snapshotting. and of course, I maintain an extensive blacklist to skip archives where they would be a bad idea because of updates
[19:31:48] <feep[work]> the core bit is that you never write a "serializable object hierarchy"/"encoder hierarchy"
[19:32:01] <gwern> in practice whenever I review my 90-day archives, I find that activity has usually died out long before. in fact, 90-days is sometimes already too long and it's bitrot
[19:32:17] <feep[work]> ie. your JSONObject encode(DomainObject object) { ... result["foo"] = encode(object.foo); ...
[19:32:20] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: To put it another way, linking to archives exclusively is the position of the outsider, the alien observer/archivist - not the active participant in the noosphere, so to speak. This posture is appropriate perhaps for gwern.net, but for an actual blog it seems to me to be diametrically wrong!
[19:33:06] <feep[work]> instead, first of all you want your decoder/encoder to *usually* be fine with unadorned domain objects, ie. know to encode ints, floats, strings, simple structs, arrays, etc in the straightforward way
[19:33:25] <feep[work]> so your problem is reduced to handling unusual types
[19:34:03] <feep[work]> then you handle those by defining an encode/decode function that transforms that object into a more easily serializable type, but here's the important part - you *don't* specify that object's members in terms of serializable types, you specify it in terms of domain types again
[19:34:13] *** Joins: [itchyjunk] (~itchyjunk@user/itchyjunk/x-7353470)
[19:34:21] <feep[work]> so you go into manual encoding, but as soon as utterly possible you go back into automatic encoding
[19:35:08] <feep[work]> ie. it's not Foo { Bar } encode(Foo) -> FooSerializable { BarSerializable bar }, but FooSerializable { Bar bar; }
[19:35:31] <feep[work]> that way, you stay reliably wedded to the assumption that "usually, the autoencoder is fine"
[19:36:00] <feep[work]> also by not using JSON objects, you make your life easier if you want to switch to a stream en/decoder
[19:36:09] <gurkenglas> feep[work]: Can you relate this to the difference between "list of int" and "(int -> (x->x)) -> (x->x)"?
[19:36:25] <feep[work]> gurkenglas: I don't think so :P
[19:36:30] <feep[work]> this is all very Cy
[19:36:30] <rsaarelm> gwern: So are you talking archive.is links for "archive links only" or wayback machine? The reason to keep the original around is that the archive site might go kaput as well and if you're only left with an opaque hash that was known to only that site, you don't know what to ask from any more recent archive site that might still be around.
[19:36:46] <rsaarelm> Also, that last letter archive link convention is wild.
[19:37:01] <gwern> rsaarelm: you shouldn't use archive.is as anything but a convenient source of snapshots to download and host elsewhere
[19:37:13] <gurkenglas> feep[work]: I don't follow yet. Suppose I have a list of list of ints. How would you approach turn it into a string?
[19:37:19] <rsaarelm> Wayback machine links of course have the original URL in an easily extractable form so they should be fine.
[19:37:39] <gwern> rsaarelm: the opacity of its urls are but the least of its problems. IA links are much preferable in general, although they don't blow through paywalls the way archive.is does
[19:37:40] <feep[work]> gurkenglas: oh, I'm fully in json land here, so let's call it "turn it into a json object"
[19:37:48] <gurkenglas> sure
[19:38:00] <feep[work]> then, well, that's the sort of datatype your autoencoder should understand natively
[19:38:19] <feep[work]> I mean, you just recurse your encode function, that at least is fairly straightforward
[19:38:21] <gurkenglas> okay what if i made a custom list data type "gurklist" and i have a gurklist of gurklists of ints
[19:38:26] <feep[work]> rightright
[19:38:46] <feep[work]> so let's say, in D parlance, gurklist(T) { ... }
[19:39:13] <dbohdan|phone> "<gwern> do u even pinch bro" rofl!
[19:39:14] <feep[work]> so you'd do.. alias EncodableGurkList(T) = T[];
[19:39:28] <feep[work]> T[] encode(T)(EncodableGurkList!T) ...
[19:39:41] <feep[work]> so you punt it over into a form your encoder likes
[19:39:55] <feep[work]> but that form is based on the domain type again.
[19:40:06] <feep[work]> you don't end up, ever, with EncodableGurkList!(EncodableGurkList!T)
[19:40:21] <feep[work]> er, EncodableGurkList!T encode(T)(gurklist!T) sorry
[19:40:22] *** Joins: gproto23 (~gproto23@user/gproto23)

[19:41:18] * feep[work] tries to parse
[19:41:32] <nshepperd> surely your custom encode function just converts a gurklist into a regular list
[19:41:36] <feep[work]> yes
[19:41:43] <gurkenglas> [[Int]] in Haskell means "list of lists of ints"
[19:41:43] <nshepperd> and then you apply the built in encoding
[19:41:46] <nshepperd> easy
[19:41:52] <feep[work]> nshepperd: the point is, I don't have to define a special encoder for "list of lists".
[19:41:59] <nshepperd> right
[19:42:13] <nshepperd> The list encoder works for a list of anything
[19:42:17] <feep[work]> because I encode to regular list *of gurklists*, and then bounce those down separately.
[19:42:27] <feep[work]> yeah. it seems a bit trivial for T[][] :P
[19:42:44] <feep[work]> it's more interesting when it's like, datatype T ... datatype U = do something with T
[19:43:10] <feep[work]> the idea is that you end up with sort of a zigzag movement between autoencoder and encoder helper
[19:43:16] <gurkenglas> feep[work]: wait now you've confused me again. I thought this is about the difference between encoding to a regular list and then bouncing them down separately, and bouncing them down separately and then collecting the results into a regular lists
[19:43:34] <feep[work]> gurkenglas: oh no, the core point is to avoid this pattern
[19:43:41] <gurkenglas> which of them

[19:44:41] <gurkenglas> encodeHelper being the thing that is to be avoided
[19:44:51] <feep[work]> well, encodeHelper is fine, -> JSON is the thing to avoid.
[19:45:14] <feep[work]> 1. never go to json, always go to "easily digestible intermediate data type"
[19:45:27] <feep[work]> 2. "define the intermediate type in terms of *domain types*, not of other intermediate types."
[19:45:32] <feep[work]> -""
[19:45:51] <gurkenglas> okay, now it sounds like the "[Int]" vs. "forall x. (Int->(x->x))->(x->x)" thing again :)
[19:46:01] <feep[work]> well, I don't actually speak haskell
[19:46:08] <feep[work]> so I have to take your word for it??
[19:46:13] <gurkenglas> "What is a list?"
[19:46:22] <gurkenglas> "Understand it in terms of what it allows you to do:"
[19:46:33] <feep[work]> that really doesn't seem like the thing.
[19:46:44] <feep[work]> maybe you need to have seen the bad way of writing encoders in action to recognize what this replaces.
[19:46:52] <gurkenglas> "If you can use an element of the list to transform something, you can compose those transformations"
[19:47:10] <feep[work]> anyway, I am going home!
[19:47:13] <gurkenglas> ok :c
[19:49:35] <nshepperd> in Haskell you would have like, class Encodable a where encode :: a -> JSON
[19:50:05] <gurkenglas> you *could* have that, i bet Haskell can encode all the variants feep talked about

[23:40:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> quanticle_: And...

[23:55:50] <ggreer> peak pressures are lower. I think the only risk would be the warhead exploding early
[23:56:40] <dbohdan[phone]> I see
[23:57:45] <dbohdan[phone]> gwern: Did you receive an alert about the fake research paper I was trying to get Google Scholar to index? It lists me as the author.
