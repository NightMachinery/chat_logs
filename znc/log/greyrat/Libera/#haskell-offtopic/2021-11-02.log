[13:29:44] <[exa]> automatic differentiation question: is there any general approach that would be able to produce reasonable array-ish code that computes the gradients?
[13:33:18] <[exa]> example: normally I'd write the function I'm differentiating somehow algebraically, and I'd get a piece of expression that computes some dimension of the gradient, say gradient[3]=some..expression. Problem: the code pieces aren't necessarily equal for all elements in the gradient, but I'd love to compute them with the same code (because well, GPUs)
[13:35:23] <[exa]> simpler problem: how do I run this reasonably even if the gradient code is basically same (except for a few indexes) for all gradient dimensions?
[13:36:54] <[exa]> looks like a really ugly partial evaluation exercise to me now, hopefully I'm missing something (e.g. the last 10 years of AD development)

[17:00:29] <merijn> [exa]: This code uses Popen which in cpython is implemented using fork (because they're wildly irresponsible) and pytest is 1) fucking with file descriptors to intercept output and 2) using multiple threads, so the child process is running a wildly inconsistent garbage environment :\

[21:17:51] <[exa]> tomsmeding: ey you're doing an actual phd on that topic right? :D
[21:18:00] <tomsmeding> yes lol
[21:18:03] <[exa]> anyway
[21:18:54] <[exa]> the simplest case is that I have just E = sum(x .^ 2)
[21:19:37] <[exa]> the derivation of E is super simple, and I'd like to transform that to a program that is capable enough to write: gradient(i) = 2*x[i]
[21:20:25] <[exa]> generally the simpler libs can only do this with constant `i` (ie. you need to ask for a formula for each `i`), more complicated libs can do this case easily
[21:20:37] <tomsmeding> I have code that transforms '\x -> sum (map (^ 2) x)' to '\x d -> zipWith (\xi di -> di * 2 * xi) x d' after simplification
[21:20:40] <[exa]> but it generally doesn't compose very nicely
[21:21:15] <tomsmeding> but if your operations are all first-order, like you don't have a generic 'map' just vectorised operations à la numpy, AD is fairly easy to get right and efficient
[21:21:29] <[exa]> like, if I throw in say 1 matrix multiplication and some exponentials, all libs I tried just fail
[21:21:39] <[exa]> and yeah, conditionals
[21:22:04] <[exa]> ha, is that simplification available somewhere?
[21:22:18] <tomsmeding> I wonder, I haven't looked too closely ad kmett's 'ad' but does it allow you to add custom primitives?
[21:22:32] <tomsmeding> if so, add sum, matmul, mapexp, etc.
[21:22:36] <[exa]> anyway I started researching the resources for this task like 1 week ago so maybe I just didn't reach the state of art
[21:22:49] <tomsmeding> that simplification is just array fusion in accelerate
[21:22:50] <[exa]> if there's a kmetty solution I guess it will just do
[21:23:02] <tomsmeding> but if you're really looking for gpu support, 'ad' won't do that
[21:23:16] <[exa]> nah to the GPU I can translate it myself
[21:23:29] <ongy[m]> merijn: are you actually surprised by python being garbage?
[21:23:31] <tomsmeding> ah you want the symbolic thing
[21:23:36] <[exa]> I wouldn't let anything automatic to GPU, everything I saw is just bad
[21:24:02] <tomsmeding> yeah so my Accelerate code can probably handle what you want, but perhaps not the best implementation if you don't need second-order map
[21:24:12] <[exa]> the main point is that 1] I get at least "decent" CPU code 2] I have something that I can easily base the GPU impl on
[21:24:48] <[exa]> re "best implementation" -- I haven't seen automated GPU programming that gets even halfway to humans
[21:25:13] <[exa]> futhark is good but yeah caches and registers :]
[21:25:42] <tomsmeding> I don't think I have a ready-to-use lib that does exactly what you want, except if you're fine with post-fusion accelerate pretty-printer output
[21:25:57] <[exa]> prettyprinter could work too
[21:26:00] <tomsmeding> but if you give me a week or 3 (really really busy right now), I can implement it easily :p
[21:26:02] <[exa]> will have a look, thanks a lot :D

[21:27:27] <tomsmeding> yeah the branch name is meaningful in a way that takes too long to explain now :p
[21:27:35] <tomsmeding> doesn't refer to the code breaking
[21:27:44] <[exa]> we're doing some metabolic modeling and there are "features" there that you can switch on and off, and I need AD on there that respects the features but still produces some reasonable code that you can at least parallelize with MPI or something

[21:49:28] <geekosaur> that's where I get hung up on this, if I have the logs available I can profile you myself pretty simply
[21:49:30] <dminuoso> The real question is

[21:52:53] <geekosaur> hm, that doesn't sound like "free pass" to me, because it implies it's not being tossed up on a web page

[21:54:11] <geekosaur> sounds like they exempt (for example) controlling (over)usage of your wifi by family members/guests
[21:54:50] <[exa]> questions: 1] do some people not realize this, thus requiring GDPR protection? 2] does archiving the "history" of such publicly available information open door for e.g. criminals that are new to business to identify more, thus requiring GDPR regulation?

[22:03:36] <dminuoso> 19:26:04  boxscape_ | [exa] does the law care about whether people realize it, or only about whether they give explicit consent?
[22:03:41] <dminuoso> this one is quite simple
[22:03:44] <dminuoso> you just need to have legal basis
[22:03:53] <dminuoso> consent is just one way to obtainthat legal basis
[22:03:57] <boxscape_> I see
[22:04:14] <boxscape_> so I suppose if it can be expected to be required by the service you're using, that's fine
[22:04:15] <dminuoso> See https://gdpr.eu/article-6-how-to-process-personal-data-legally/
[22:04:17] <geekosaur> 22, and some of those are ephemeral (one is a shipment tracker that will be closed when it arrives)
[22:04:35] <dminuoso> It's a common misconception that one always needs consent.
[22:04:45] <dminuoso> In many cases b) already applies
[22:04:49] <geekosaur> if you're talking browser tabs, 21
[22:04:51] <dminuoso> b) processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party or in order to take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract;
[22:05:23] <geekosaur> er, if you're talking irc client tabs (doh)
[22:06:01] <dminuoso> geekosaur: I think operating a personal website fits the requirement of "purely personal or household activity"
[22:06:17] <monochrom> "If you continue to use this site we will assume that you are happy with it."  ("it" = cookies)
[22:06:18] <boxscape_> dminuoso did you see the precedent I quoted? It seems to go against that
[22:06:35] <dminuoso> Ah
[22:06:51] <geekosaur> dminuoso, ^^ plus I think that would only be true if the website itself were for purely personal or household use
[22:06:59] <dminuoso> boxscape_: Do you have a link for me to chase? Or a court filing number?
[22:07:03] <boxscape_> sec
[22:07:06] <geekosaur> but this one's advertised on the internet
[22:07:29] <geekosaur> (granted, in an irc channel /topic, but that's still publicly advertised)
[22:07:36] <boxscape_> dminuoso https://www.reddit.com/r/gdpr/comments/d1bkww/what_does_purely_personal_or_household_activity/ezk6kyo/ is where I got it and has the case filing number

[22:08:55] <boxscape_> same
[22:09:01] <dminuoso> So I guess..

[22:15:07] <geekosaur> I also wonder about jurisdiction: if tomsmeding is also in the U.S., to what extent does the European GDPR apply to him? the Internet being global makes for a complicated legal environment
[22:15:49] <dminuoso> You raise a valid point there.

[22:18:22] <geekosaur> right, so a personally operated website in the U.S. would not be covered. so if I were to put up such a website (not that I could, at least not right now) I wouldn't be affected by the GDPR
[22:18:45] <geekosaur> but I wonder if I'd have to have a disclaimer of some sort for European visitors or something
[22:18:49] <dminuoso> Nope, art 3 paragraph 2 b) covers that
[22:18:54] <dminuoso> 2. 
[22:18:55] <dminuoso> This Regulation applies to the processing of personal data of data subjects who are in the Union by a controller or processor not established in the Union, where the processing activities are related to:
[22:19:00] <dminuoso> b. the monitoring of their behaviour as far as their behaviour takes place within the Union.
[22:19:02] <boxscape_> I suspect it would be hard to enforce though
[22:19:11] <boxscape_> unless you just ban the website in teh EU
[22:19:13] <dminuoso> a. the offering of goods or services, irrespective of whether a payment of the data subject is required, to such data subjects in the Union; or
[22:19:31] <geekosaur> hm, then that raises the question of how many of libera's servers are in the EU
[22:19:32] <dminuoso> boxscape_: Dunno, a fine seems quite enforceable.
[22:19:38] <geekosaur> which seems to be "many"

[22:19:51] <dminuoso> boxscape_: At some point in his life, Tom Smeding likely wants to collect pension

[22:20:20] <boxscape_> We're still talking about a hypothetical US citizen? Or not anymore?
[22:21:14] <geekosaur> I think ewe've switched over to the assumption that toomsmeding is a .nl citizen, or at least an EU citizen
[22:21:28] <boxscape_> okay then I agree it would be enforceable

[22:34:43] <tomsmeding> thanks for the extensive analysis of my person
[22:34:55] <tomsmeding> dminuoso: it was not and perhaps it should have been
[22:35:01] <Rembane_> tomsmeding: You're like James Bond but on IRC.
[22:35:10] <tomsmeding> though I didn't _start_ ircbrowse as much as re-hosted the thing that chris done hosted earlier
[22:35:33] <tomsmeding> Rembane_: 😎
[22:35:56] <tomsmeding> I wonder though, if ircbrowse violates gdpr, how many other irc logging stuff violates the same thing
[22:36:18] <tomsmeding> or did people conclude that it's not the logging that is in violation of the law, but the collection and sharing of statistics about said logs?
[22:36:29] <tomsmeding> like, tunes-style logging would be in the clear
[22:36:55] <geekosaur> we're still waiting to find that out, I think
[22:37:08] <Rembane_> Do we have a tame GDPR lawyer? 
[22:37:09] <dminuoso> Well, storing is also a kind of processing
[22:37:11] <geekosaur> [exa] is asking for advice from gdpr lawyers
[22:37:15] <Rembane_> Sweet! 
[22:37:16] <tomsmeding> yeah I'm quite curious about the response from the lawyers
[22:37:19] <dminuoso> In fact, it's explicitly even named in the definition of data processing
[22:37:22] <tomsmeding> right
[22:37:29] <tomsmeding> so what about matrix bridging of irc channels
[22:37:41] <tomsmeding> what's different between that and tunes-style log storing
[22:37:55] <dminuoso> At the end it really just boils down to whether the "purely private or household" exemption applies, and there's strong evidence given by a CJEU ruling it does not
[22:37:55] <geekosaur> https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/27096/are-chat-logs-against-the-new-european-gdpr was also pointed to earlier
[22:39:17] <tomsmeding> that answer doesn't apply, right? It's neither for personal use only, nor for commercial use
[22:39:30] <tomsmeding> I'm _losing_ money over hosting that site, dammit
[22:39:37] <boxscape_> it doesn't quite cover this case unfortunately, yeah
[22:39:40] <Rembane_> Is there a fair use in EU law? 
[22:40:09] * tomsmeding wonders how many profile views linkedin is going to show me after that mention my profile a bit back
[22:40:11] <dminuoso> tomsmeding: so Id say gdpr applies for a simple reason:
[22:40:18] <dminuoso> it applies because there's no excemption.
[22:40:21] <tomsmeding> yeah
[22:40:26] <dminuoso> you're excercising data processing and profiling
[22:40:50] <tomsmeding> I haven't read the actual thing, but naively, it would make sense that it applies: it's processing of personal data
[22:41:18] <tomsmeding> the intuition-based reasoning doesn't provide an answer for pure logging (and hosting) though, but that's probably also covered -- but then I ask about all the matrix bridges
[22:41:30] <dminuoso> Its covered, let me show you
[22:41:42] <tomsmeding> (sorry for letting you repeat stuff to me)
[22:41:50] <boxscape_> the matrix bridges are an interesting point
[22:42:31] <tomsmeding> like, ircbrowse being in violation is fine -- I can take that offline or whatever, but if this means that 1e4 people are now in violation due to the random bridges and logging everyone has, that's a bigger issue
[22:42:35] <dminuoso> https://gdpr.eu/article-4-definitions/
[22:42:44] <dminuoso> ‘processing’ means any operation or set of operations which is performed on personal data or on sets of personal data, whether or not by automated means, such as collection, recording, organisation, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination,
[22:42:45] <geekosaur> matrix itself is an interesting point since it's doing backlogging, and might count as commercial
[22:42:46] <dminuoso> restriction, erasure or destruction;
[22:42:56] <dminuoso> You are most definitely: collecting, recording, organizing, structurung and storing these data.
[22:43:08] <tomsmeding> yes
[22:43:16] <dminuoso> And in your per-user profile you are also excercising profiling as per:
[22:43:19] <boxscape_> matrix has this but it doesn't mention IRC https://matrix.org/blog/2018/05/08/gdpr-compliance-in-matrix
[22:43:21] <dminuoso> ‘profiling’ means any form of automated processing of personal data consisting of the use of personal data to evaluate certain personal aspects relating to a natural person, in particular to analyse or predict aspects concerning that natural person’s performance at work, economic situation, health, personal preferences, interests, reliability, behaviour, location or movements;
[22:43:26] <tomsmeding> geekosaur: not sure if personal servers would count as commercial

[22:47:22] <dminuoso> consent is one possible way to obtain legal basis
[22:47:29] <dminuoso> tomsmeding: sure it does
[22:47:34] <dminuoso> your tool could simply have an opt-in
[22:47:38] <geekosaur> there is some justification for knowing activity periods, for example: people who (say) pop into #xmonad might appreciate knowing when someone is around to answer questions
[22:47:44] <dminuoso> it only tracks people who have given their consent

[22:49:38] <dminuoso> Or potentially yes.
[22:49:42] <geekosaur> my recollection is that by combining such records one could still work out personal identifying information

[22:56:51] <janus> but why put the chinese given name before the western given name? just because it sounds better than cytrebla ? 
[22:56:59] <janus> or because it looks more like trebla?
[22:57:35] <monochrom> So basically my algorithm for creating new accounts is I try "trebla" and then "treblacy". And if "treblacy" fails too (hasn't happened), I'll append the first letter of my family name, making "treblacyl", now that's even a chemical name haha.

[22:58:08] <tomsmeding> that u went for a walk
[22:58:53] <monochrom> Ah OK, in the Hong Kong convention, names go this order: family name, chinese given name, western given name.  I am reversing that.
[22:59:45] <janus> ah right, reverse the letters, also reverse the name order. consistent reversing
[23:03:50] <awpr> and if that fails, infer the inverse of the "abbreviate a chemical name into a pharmaceutical brand name" algorithm and get something like tetraboro-1-oxalate carbonyl.  that's not gonna be taken for sure
