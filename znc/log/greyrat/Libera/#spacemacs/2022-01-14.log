[06:17:12] <FromGitter> <jordanjones98> Hello All, I love spacemacs, but one thing that bugs me is when I get done with a feature, create a PR, etc. I like to close out of all of my files. When I do this it quits all of emacs. Can I make it so it just shows my project directory instead with configuration?
[06:22:11] <FromGitter> <glmdgrielson:matrix.org> My best answer to that is open the directory and close everything else?

[14:19:13] <FromGitter> <kassick> @jordanjones98  , some options I use for this use-case: ‚èé  ‚èé 1) `SPC p k` to kill all your the buffers in your current project (usually followed by 'C-x 1' or `SPC w m` to keep only one window opened inside the frame ‚èé 2) use the ibuffer layer ( `(ibuffer :variables ibuffer-group-buffers-by 'projects)` ) , cursor on the project you want to kill, `D` followed by `x` ‚èé 3) use emacs in server mode, so you can 
[14:19:13] <FromGitter> ... just kill a frame without killing emacs. Maybe also something like described here https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/2888/kill-buffer-when-frame-is-deleted , so you can kill the frame and have all displayed buffers killed too [https://gitter.im/syl20bnr/spacemacs?at=61e155292a210c38c1ca78b6]

[18:51:50] <FromGitter> <jordanjones98> Thanks for all of the answers. I would not mind leaving the directory open and closing everything else but it seems like Spacemacs treats the treemacs window differently when it comes to buffers and closing. I am coming from (a heavily modified) vanilla vim so just trying to wrap my head around this spacemacs stuff. It is much better than vanilla vim, that is for sure!

[19:55:30] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> @programmador I don't use php so I am not sure... but you can check if you can configure things under `SPC SPC customize-group` `lsp-intelephense`.
[19:56:10] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> If that does not already provide the options, then maybe try to wrap your code in `(with-eval-after-load 'lsp-php ...)`
[19:58:49] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> For the second problem, I guess you could start Spacemacs from the command line using `emacs --debug-init`
