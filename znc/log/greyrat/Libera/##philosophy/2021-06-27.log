[00:00:01] <zicada> i like the (weak) antropic principle as much as the next guy
[00:00:29] <zicada> arryana: its mostly about right now when we are around, the likelyhood of that. Meaningfulness for sure, just not exactly now
[00:00:54] <zicada> they'll notice us and put on their engines and we're wiped out by the time they get here
[00:01:05] <arryana> in your opinion.  i don't agree.
[00:01:09] <DunceCotus> is it improbable we are here or is it simply a production of desire
[00:01:27] <zicada> its probably we are here, that its real
[00:01:37] <DunceCotus> we're here-ish
[00:01:37] <arryana> and for sure neither of us can prove it, so... probably not worth discussing further
[00:01:42] <zicada> aristotelian on that one
[00:01:52] <zicada> if we cant say that we cant do any science or math with any certainty
[00:01:55] <zicada> and we wont get anywhere
[00:02:03] <DunceCotus> desire desired humans and their society
[00:02:10] <DunceCotus> thus here we are
[00:02:23] <zicada> so, trust our eyes, shitty as they may be, however little of reality they take in, its what we've got to work with
[00:02:30] <arryana> hahah
[00:02:33] <zicada> we've come pretty far in the extremely short time we've been around
[00:02:41] <arryana> if you only know what you've seen, you're destined for an amazingly limited life
[00:03:12] <DunceCotus> seeing is bereaving
[00:03:30] <zicada> absolutely, dreams and ideals and goals are mostly about things you haven't seen
[00:03:41] <zicada> yet, importantly
[00:04:11] <DunceCotus> zicada UAP report. get on it
[00:04:17] <DunceCotus> aliens are here man
[00:04:48] <DunceCotus> they just don't want to talk for some reason (or they can't talk? or it would be disadvantageous to them or to us or both to do so?
[00:05:10] <zicada> but the point isn't traditionalism or conservatism arryana. I simply want to impress on you the differnce between 13.8 billion years, 4.5 million years, 100 000 years, 10 000 years, and 2000 years
[00:05:18] <zicada> those are common distinctions used
[00:05:42] <zicada> the other ones may have existed within say +/-1 12 billion of that
[00:06:06] <zicada> soo its mostly about the staistical likelyhood that human beings get to be around to see all that life
[00:06:08] <arryana> i understand what you're saying.  i just don't agree with you.
[00:06:13] <zicada> than there statisticaly being life
[00:06:20] <arryana> repeating it is not going to make me agree, either
[00:06:28] <arryana> so... it'd be great if you'd cut out browbeating
[00:06:34] <zicada> i wish it wasnt so, i wanna see aliens too, but im in the business of stats and data, not wishing
[00:06:41] * arryana rolls her eyes
[00:06:42] <arryana> whatever
[00:06:48] <arryana> i have no interest in seeing aliens
[00:06:57] <DunceCotus> zicada time is kinda a moot point though
[00:07:02] <arryana> i'm not invested in it either way
[00:07:11] * I_Am_M00t   
[00:07:15] <zicada> you have an interesting in pointing out to people that limiting their options is a bad idea i think arryana
[00:07:17] <DunceCotus> when you have space-time manipulation (which would be best way of traversing universe), you also have a time machine
[00:07:20] <zicada> which i agree with, and point well taken
[00:07:40] <zicada> also, he is moot
[00:07:43] <zicada> I_Am_M00t: <-
[00:07:50] <DunceCotus> aliens could be from any time
[00:08:05] <DunceCotus> but sure they may not come to our little patch of space-time very often
[00:08:26] <zicada> DunceCotus: lol that sentence is pretty funny :)
[00:08:38] <zicada> DunceCotus: when <-- you have space-time manipulation
[00:08:57] *** Joins: aototot (~teteetett@92.114.82.95)
[00:09:04] <DunceCotus> zicada well if you are warping space-time.. that affects both space and time
[00:09:05] <zicada> its a misnomer if you think about it, if you think they can travel in both directions
[00:09:12] <I_Am_M00t> ^
[00:09:16] <DunceCotus> and warping space-time seems to be the best way to move about in the universe given the distances
[00:09:37] <zicada> DunceCotus: yes but if you could travel back in time we'd already know about it
[00:09:45] <DunceCotus> zicada would we?
[00:10:00] <DunceCotus> people have had experiences...
[00:10:10] <zicada> DunceCotus: yes, humans suck at keeping secrets
[00:10:27] <DunceCotus> perhaps there's some legislation with time travel
[00:10:41] <zicada> i bet it can be proven mathematically that you cant trust an average human to keep a huge secret
[00:10:51] <DunceCotus> and as you said there's a lot of timespan in which they could visit
[00:10:56] <DunceCotus> that doesn't mean they'll visit our time
[00:11:02] <zicada> hehe
[00:11:21] <zicada> if you combine it with memory-blocking/removal tech
[00:11:21] <zicada> sure
[00:11:26] <DunceCotus> or if they do visit our time that doesn't mean they'll tell us about it
[00:11:31] <DunceCotus> or spell it out to us anyway
[00:11:33] <zicada> but then you have a classic conspiracy that you cant prove on your hands
[00:11:52] <DunceCotus> zicada we can prove UAPs tho
[00:12:00] <zicada> can we ?
[00:12:00] <DunceCotus> there's data mounting on these incidents
[00:12:08] <zicada> we'd need to capture new data
[00:12:11] <DunceCotus> zicada it seems to be a very real thing
[00:12:25] <zicada> the data we have is not sufficient to determine the exact type of bird and or balloon
[00:12:30] <zicada> the speed we know, the direction we know
[00:12:46] <DunceCotus> these are speeds and directions that balloons and birds are not capable of
[00:12:50] <zicada> in the other cases its generally variants of how cameras interact with light
[00:12:56] <DunceCotus> not even our best technology is capable of it
[00:13:02] <zicada> lenses in particular, lense physics
[00:13:38] <DunceCotus> zicada they're not just captured on equipment
[00:13:50] <zicada> DunceCotus: in the videos, most of it is displayed right there on the screens
[00:13:51] <DunceCotus> but also subjectively seen/experienced
[00:14:10] <DunceCotus> zicada yes but they can also see these things
[00:14:21] <zicada> DunceCotus: i think it may have been rookie pilots, who didnt have experience with real life use of those tools
[00:14:34] <zicada> like the omnidirectional cameras
[00:14:47] <zicada> DunceCotus: generally the reason it looks fast is parralx
[00:14:50] <zicada> parallax
[00:15:00] <DunceCotus> zicada why would US govt release such a report if it was likely some kind of equipment anomaly or noob pilots?
[00:15:10] <DunceCotus> that would be ruled out first I would think
[00:15:13] <zicada> DunceCotus: to be open
[00:15:28] <DunceCotus> zicada ?
[00:15:40] <DunceCotus> US govt is open about UFOs/UAPs? XD
[00:15:41] <zicada> DunceCotus: if they had started commentinting, it would just fuel conspirators
[00:15:51] <zicada> so its best to just release and then do a report
[00:16:18] <DunceCotus> well the question is why could they not explain these things with conventional/prosaic explanations
[00:16:27] <DunceCotus> if you can do so and so summarily
[00:16:34] <zicada> the report says basically what i said, except the bird/balloon thing, they just guess at all terrestrial objects that would appear in that general area at the time
[00:17:01] <DunceCotus> zicada the report says they may be anomalous data in some cases
[00:17:17] <DunceCotus> but it also says such possibilities have been ruled out for some cases iirc
[00:17:18] <I_Am_M00t> hmm, maybe i should read it. Didn't they basically say they don't know what it is? That they need further analysis?
[00:17:40] <DunceCotus> at one point they call for advances in science to explain them
[00:17:45] <zicada> DunceCotus: why do you assume they ought to be able to identity exactly what the plains pick up ?
[00:18:04] <DunceCotus> zicada cause why not?
[00:18:12] <zicada> its a piece of matter, moving in a direction, its probably a bird
[00:18:13] <zicada> a duck
[00:18:20] <DunceCotus> they already know what balloons and birds look like on their equipment
[00:18:28] <DunceCotus> they know what other planes look like
[00:18:37] <zicada> experienced pilots hopefully do
[00:18:41] <DunceCotus> they know what anomalies/system bugs look like etc.
[00:18:48] <zicada> these guys think its hilarious
[00:18:56] <zicada> theyre making themselves look stupid
[00:19:05] <zicada> and people use it as "proof" :)
[00:19:29] <zicada> yea its proof people who get gigs flying airplanes arent experts at lense physics
[00:19:37] <DunceCotus> zicada then you have people reporting actually seeing these things, not just detecting them on instruments
[00:19:43] <DunceCotus> are they all lying? Hallucinating?
[00:19:52] <zicada> DunceCotus: no they saw it
[00:20:03] <DunceCotus> so if they saw it, and the instruments saw it
[00:20:07] <zicada> DunceCotus: but they interpreted what they saw incorrectly
[00:20:10] <zicada> as humans often do
[00:20:23] <zicada> DunceCotus: the instruments are a camera usually
[00:20:28] <zicada> DunceCotus: with a large lense on it
[00:20:31] <DunceCotus> the instruments back up their observations though
[00:20:38] <DunceCotus> in terms of behavior of these things
[00:20:41] <zicada> DunceCotus: this is the answer to pretty much 90% of all "sightings"
[00:20:50] <zicada> various lense physics, that you can recreate
[00:20:54] <zicada> at will in a lab
[00:20:57] <zicada> to create aliens on tape
[00:21:02] <DunceCotus> lense physics?
[00:21:06] <zicada> yes
[00:21:10] <zicada> hang on
[00:21:16] <zicada> let me get you a video that shows what i mean
[00:21:21] <p0indexter> instruments are radar and forward looking infared
[00:21:22] <spruit11> what's wrong with fueling conspirators? they're very useful to the US system
[00:21:35] <spruit11> not too much,  but a bit is fine
[00:22:21] <DunceCotus> so when people are seeing solid objects with the naked eye, doing unexplainable manoeuvres
[00:22:25] <p0indexter> radar detects its a physical object reflecting rf and infared detects its tempurature compared to surroundings
[00:22:25] <voltage> did you guys listen to the new tyler the creator album
[00:22:28] <DunceCotus> they're seeing what, lensing?

[00:25:01] <p0indexter> w/o the nwo jones has 0 income
[00:25:03] <zicada> were they debunked by poeple who believe in aliens ? i mean where do we draw the line on what it means to debunk

[00:26:20] *** Quits: p0indexter (~alpha@user/p0indexter) (Remote host closed the connection)
[00:26:28] <DunceCotus> zicada its not lensing
[00:26:41] <DunceCotus> and its not heat signature from the back of a plane
[00:26:51] <zicada> DunceCotus: did you watch to the part where you see him putting alum foil over a lense ?
[00:27:11] <DunceCotus> zicada just because doing that may produce a similar appearance to the video doesn't explain the video
[00:27:12] <zicada> its exactly the right term for the phenomenon people see and react to as UFO
[00:27:29] <DunceCotus> and gravity propulsion may involve lensing anyway
[00:27:37] <zicada> its not matter, its lense physics
[00:27:42] <zicada> its becasue its seen thrlugh a lense
[00:27:48] <zicada> if it wasnt, you wouldnt have seen it
[00:27:51] <zicada> therefore its lense physics
[00:27:57] <DunceCotus> people who have seen UFOs will not say its lensing
[00:28:07] <DunceCotus> they will say its a solid object
[00:28:09] <DunceCotus> doing crazy shit
[00:28:16] <zicada> so what ?
[00:28:19] <DunceCotus> and not a sundog or some shit
[00:28:22] <zicada> humans aren't automatically truthful
[00:28:25] <zicada> or knows what they saw

[00:29:14] <zicada> that we will never interact with

[00:29:39] <DunceCotus> zicada statistics based on our current understanding
[00:29:56] <zicada> yes, and showing constraint in WANTING things to be true
[00:30:07] <DunceCotus> zicada humans aren't automatically truthful, but I think most people can differentiate between an optical illusion and a solid object
[00:30:11] <zicada> ofcourse i want there to be other civs now that we can interact with and learn from come on
[00:30:15] <zicada> that would be so amazingh
[00:30:25] <DunceCotus> zicada and these objects can get very very close
[00:30:25] <zicada> but its extremely unlikely ..
[00:30:29] <DunceCotus> like right above a house
[00:30:33] <DunceCotus> that's not lensing xD
[00:31:03] <zicada> DunceCotus: of course it is, they "come close" from the perpsecive of the lense
[00:31:08] <zicada> noone outside sees iut
[00:31:08] <zicada> it
[00:31:10] <DunceCotus> but there is a good point to be made why we don't have better footage of these things
[00:31:23] <DunceCotus> zicada what lens?
[00:31:34] <zicada> if aliens or ufos were real, we would have so much better informatoin
[00:31:53] <arryana> haha
[00:32:06] <arryana> yeah, cause the general public handles things so incredibly well
[00:32:09] <DunceCotus> they could be real but just not easily captured
[00:32:09] <zicada> its too clear that this is a human cultural phenomenon that is similar to finding bigfoot
[00:32:30] <arryana> everyone knows bigfoot isn't real.  the loch ness monster said so.
[00:32:56] <zicada> and the aliens nodded sagely while looking at eachother
[00:33:18] <DunceCotus> ufos are often spotted at same time as seeing bigfoot
[00:33:25] <I_Am_M00t> i don't understand why occam's razor goes out the window with aliens
[00:33:26] <DunceCotus> bigfoot is not lensing artifact
[00:33:31] <I_Am_M00t> UFOs/aliens
[00:33:31] <arryana> you're just never going to convince me with the argument of 'i haven't seen it so it doesn't exist'
[00:33:56] <zicada> people who spot UFO's are often much more interested in Big foot than average citizens
[00:33:59] <DunceCotus> I_Am_M00t the simplest explanation is there are aliens ?
[00:34:15] <DunceCotus> and these are alien space ships? Yeah I have always thought that
[00:34:22] <I_Am_M00t> hehe
[00:34:23] <I_Am_M00t> ok
[00:34:27] <DunceCotus> occam's razor seems to suggest that these are simply aliens in space ships
[00:34:27] <spruit11> rainbow pooping unicorns are neat too
[00:34:36] <zicada> even though they are entirely different concepts, the only think they have in common is being really unlikely but also cultural stories
[00:34:46] <DunceCotus> its far less simple to say its some kind of mass hysteria etc
[00:35:15] <zicada> i think thats kinda simple
[00:35:19] <zicada> maybe too simple
[00:35:26] <DunceCotus> well explain mass hysteria
[00:35:29] <zicada> but it seems explanatory
[00:35:39] <zicada> mass hystiria is confined to cultures
[00:35:47] <DunceCotus> what is it, what produces it
[00:35:54] <zicada> some cultures have entire series of psychological things that can happen
[00:35:56] <zicada> that others dont
[00:36:21] <DunceCotus> why is aliens not a simpler explanation?
[00:36:30] <DunceCotus> mass hysteria is vague as a concept
[00:36:35] <zicada> in some places its culturally acceptable to just fall over and be unconcious when somebody accuses you of something and youre lost for words, and then blame it on various spirits
[00:36:42] <DunceCotus> aliens is just, 'sorta us but from elsewhere'
[00:37:02] <zicada> shitty thing to do if it was their fault, but spirits none the less, doing some work for you
[00:37:31] <zicada> i look fwd to the day the aliens do come
[00:37:48] <zicada> meanwhile its poeple looking for bigfoot
[00:38:06] <DunceCotus> I think the problem with skeptics is they mix up legitimate phenomenon with the bandwagoners and fraudsters
[00:38:25] <DunceCotus> they seem to get lost in the latter and forget the legitimate phenomenon or assume it must all be the latter
[00:38:25] <zicada> i think theyre more likely than not to be nice too, i think techskill and being reasonable overlaps enough
[00:38:41] <zicada> that if you found a way to get here, youre probably smart enough to not be a huge dick about it
[00:40:14] <zicada> but we can obviously only guess, the idea that intelligence and understanding/wisdom somehow leads to niceness/sympathy for other lifeforms, as though i give ants a second thought when i crush them
[00:41:11] <zicada> maybe its different for everyone when its about concious lifeforms, presuming ants aren't

[00:44:48] <zicada> for a long part of their history
[00:45:04] <arryana> that's way too much assumption
[00:45:10] <zicada> but their history could be 10 times as long, and so they learned things we havent
[00:45:15] <DunceCotus> parallel evolution.
[00:45:21] <arryana> now you're in pure fantasy
[00:45:23] <arryana> so, i'm out
[00:45:35] <zicada> would it be fair to assume one of the things they learned had o do with flying around other planats pretending to not be there ?
[00:45:43] <zicada> and looking like lenseflares and ducks ?
[00:45:46] <zicada> NOT LIKELY
[00:45:48] <DunceCotus> its not fantasy, its factasy
[00:45:49] <spruit11> why would they hide?
[00:45:52] <zicada> people who think so wants a fantasy
[00:45:58] <lalia> Still looking at text on skepticism, but I'll probably switch to reading game related material soon. :)
[00:46:04] <lalia> Speaking of fantasy. :P
[00:46:19] <arryana> yeah, games sound a lot more fun than pursuing this topic
[00:46:26] <DunceCotus> spruit11 are they hiding?
[00:46:41] <DunceCotus> perhaps they're not hiding, perhaps we're just not seeing
[00:47:00] <lalia> Gonna use some of Feist's material from his Riftwar Saga. Specifically his Hall of Worlds.
[00:47:00] <spruit11> true for my rainbow pooping unicorn too
[00:47:03] <lalia> Fun series.
[00:47:09] <arryana> oooh
[00:47:18] <I_Am_M00t> zicada: that dude who posts all the ufo sightings comes to mind
[00:47:18] <DunceCotus> spruit11 well have they captured rainbow pooping unicorn on radar too?
[00:47:32] <lalia> Should be a nice way to introduce a way to go between planes of existence for my players. :)
[00:47:44] <I_Am_M00t> astro
[00:47:44] <arryana> is it a big group?
[00:47:58] <zicada> I_Am_M00t: yeah, its more religion than it is science
[00:48:03] <lalia> Four players ATM. :)
[00:48:07] <zicada> im sure theyre having a great time
[00:48:10] <zicada> but its not science is it
[00:48:18] <arryana> brilliant, that's not a big enough group to get bogged down
[00:48:32] <zicada> can you even imagine doing science and not having a good time
[00:48:41] <lalia> It was meant to be a one-off adventure... it's becoming an extended campaign based on feedback from the players. :D
[00:48:49] <DunceCotus> we think its improbable we are here, that we evolved at all.. but if there are many many variations of the universe happening simultaneously, it seems far more probable
[00:48:49] <lalia> Great group.
[00:49:09] <zicada> lalia: d&d ?
[00:49:41] *** Joins: azizLIGHT (~azizLIGHT@user/azizlight)
[00:49:49] <lalia> Yeah, this time it's 5e. I use all sorts of mechanics though depending on the group/adventure.
[00:49:51] <arryana> that's awesome, my other half is in a role playing game group, there's seven of them including the gamesmaster
[00:50:23] <zicada> lalia: have you ever tried playing multiplayer d&d with neverwinter nights ?
[00:50:27] <lalia> This game has been all online using Discord and Roll20 too. A new experience for me.
[00:50:38] <I_Am_M00t> zicada: i see it as a form of escapism, like playing video games or hyping up a tv show
[00:50:48] <arryana> haha, neverwinter nights ended my first marriage
[00:51:01] <spruit11> huh?
[00:51:03] <zicada> arryana: surely youre not the arriana from ALFA

[00:51:08] <arryana> no.
[00:51:14] <voltage> AIPA or IPA
[00:51:17] <arryana> i didn't play, my useless ex did
[00:51:21] <voltage> what u guys think
[00:51:23] <arryana> and did nothing else with his life
[00:51:23] <DunceCotus> ALFALFA?
[00:51:29] <arryana> hence, divorce
[00:51:29] <zicada> it was a pretty big deal back in the day, neverwinter nights world
[00:51:32] <DunceCotus> I feel like we've had this convo before
[00:51:34] <lalia> I liked the video games alright, but I never got real into any of'em.
[00:51:40] <zicada> we had 20+ servers, all connected so people could travel from one to the other

[00:52:15] <arryana> i mean, his choice. his life to live.  but i wanted no part of any of that mess.
[00:52:16] <voltage> yeah
[00:52:24] <zicada> word
[00:52:25] <lalia> Gaming can be a terrible energy sinkhole done poorly.
[00:52:46] <arryana> yeah
[00:52:51] <lalia> Always a sad story too. :(
[00:52:52] <zicada> yea and the community thing on top of the game
[00:52:55] <DunceCotus> ENERGY SINKHOLE
[00:53:04] <zicada> some people end up "gaming" the forums and the drama more than the actual game etc
[00:53:06] <arryana> far as i know, he still lives in his childhood bedroom, he went back to his parents when i bailed.
[00:53:32] <arryana> it's got to be six or seven years now
[00:53:37] <DunceCotus> its okay to still live with your parents as adult
[00:53:50] <zicada> sad
[00:54:06] <lalia> Our game is going from vanilla 5e Forgotten Realms to more of a Planescape campaign with cosmic horror elements.
[00:54:10] <lalia> Should be a good time.
[00:54:13] <arryana> seems like an enormous waste of a life, to me
[00:54:16] <arryana> oooh
[00:54:22] <DPA> It's cheaper. Can recommend.

[00:55:16] <arryana> i'm not sure where my other half's game party is at the moment, i've been gone for weeks
[00:55:18] <zicada> like having a ghost that none of the other PCs knows about, talking just to a PC that wouldn't tell anyone that they were hearing voices
[00:55:22] <arryana> yeah
[00:55:23] <zicada> fun things like that
[00:55:24] <arryana> same here
[00:55:41] <DunceCotus> ghosts are real
[00:55:48] <zicada> its a good way to move the plot along

[14:06:05] <Samian> arryana  not true because it's possible to be imortal and still require oxygen.
[14:06:27] <rindolf> Maxdamantus: uvrakhah ;)
[14:07:04] <arryana> it is not possible to be immortal
[14:07:07] <arryana> that's ridiculous

[14:07:47] <arryana> and if you can't handle the mental rigors of aging, you sure as hell wouldn't handle immortality
[14:07:47] <Samian> arryana  I didn't say anyone was imortal now. I just believe it's possible. It just takes technological advances
[14:07:53] <arryana> it isn't.
[14:08:12] <Samian> arryana  before the first airplane it was still possible to fly.  Only no one had done it yet.
[14:08:17] <arryana> hahaha
[14:08:19] <arryana> good luck with that
[14:08:21] <Samian> arryana  what's your evidence that it isn't?
[14:08:29] <arryana> give me a break
[14:08:46] <Samian> What's your evidence that imortality is impossible?
[14:08:46] <arryana> the evidence is simple.  everything dies.
[14:08:47] <rindolf> arryana: i feel young
[14:09:11] <Samian> arryana I bet someone said "Obama, evidence you won't be president is that everyone who is is white."
[14:09:25] <arryana> that's completely spurious logic
[14:09:28] <arryana> and meaningless
[14:09:50] <Samian> The logic is simple: before there is a first, there hasn't yet been a first. That doesn't mean a first is impossible.

[14:10:03] <arryana> what you're arguing is like saying that mice can breathe unassisted under water
[14:10:08] <arryana> it's just not true.
[14:10:15] <arryana> no.
[14:10:30] <arryana> i'm not saying that it's impossible because it hasn't happened yet
[14:10:48] <arryana> i'm saying it's impossible because it has never happened with anything ever, anywhere.
[14:10:50] <arryana> so...
[14:10:56] <Samian> arryana  your conclusion may be right. But the way in which you reach it ignores  evidence to the contrary
[14:11:01] <arryana> whatever.
[14:11:13] <arryana> you can believe your fairytale if you want. but it's nonsense
[14:11:29] <Samian> If something hasn't ever been done before, I suppose that is evidence tending to support that it is not possible to do
[14:11:41] <Samian> so sure, that weighs in favor of your conclusion
[14:11:45] <arryana> but looking for pity here because you're not getting it in reality is quite the display
[14:13:10] <Samian> But look at what weighs against your conclusion that imortality is impossible:  The evidence that we are machines, and that machines can be figured out, altered, and controlled to do as we see fit when he reach the technology and knowledge letting us to do.
[14:13:42] <arryana> blah blah blah. nonsense babble nonse.se.
[14:14:14] <Samian> Are we not machines?
[14:14:19] <Samian> Is that statement nonsense?
[14:14:41] <arryana> blither silliness at someone else.  not intereste.d
[14:14:43] <Samian> I don't mean that we are made of metal.
[14:15:06] <Samian> arryana  okay. convo is over
[14:15:39] <arryana> amazing of you to catch up on that fact eventually
[14:16:57] <Samian> I'm glad you're having a good day too arryana  :-)
[14:17:04] <Maxdamantus> I'm pretty sure there are some organism that are effectively immortal since there isn't any particular aging mechanism.
[14:17:25] <Maxdamantus> Immortality is probably not useful evolutionarily, which is probably why you don't see it very often.
[14:18:12] <Maxdamantus> Since organisms tend to live forever will have less of a chance to create improved descendents.

[16:28:15] <lalia> For sure. A big reason we moved back to SLC area is to be near her.

[16:28:53] <lalia> rindolf: we normally meet weekly on a set schedule, it's true.
[16:29:02] <lalia> It certainly works out better that way most of the time.
[16:29:14] <arryana> i envy that, the vast majority of my family has been dead for years
[16:29:31] <rindolf> lalia: great!
[16:29:38] <arryana> my mother in law is planning to stay for december, which will be really nice
[16:30:29] <arryana> woohoo, travel covid test is negative
[16:30:31] <rindolf> «SGlau: Hah, hah. Well, for your information, my My Little Pony addicts’ support group meets every second and fourth Saturday of the month, and I am currently at step five of our twelve step program.»

[16:35:14] <rindolf> the orig "Rindolf" was a dwarven fighter i played in D&D
[16:36:11] <lalia> Nice! My partner tends to play Dwarves most of the time, especially if the setting is like Forgotten Realms or Dragonlance.
[16:36:37] <rindolf> later there were different explanations
[16:36:55] <pussipupu> Out of interest, which edition are you playing?
[16:37:38] <lalia> I use custom settings for longer games but this was meant to be a one-off adventure so we went with standard D&D 5e Forgotten Realms.
[16:37:52] <rindolf> lalia: partner as in "significant other"?'
[16:38:01] <lalia> That's gradually being adjusted using house rules however.
[16:38:15] *** Quits: xse (~xse@user/xse) (Ping timeout: 244 seconds)
[16:38:38] <pussipupu> I find 5th ed weirdly frustrating, much more limited than 3(.5)
[16:38:39] <lalia> rindolf: yeah, that. :)
[16:38:51] <pussipupu> Though of course it's never vanilla anyway
[16:39:00] <rindolf> lalia: ah
[16:39:51] <lalia> 5e needs help to get the mechanics to be very crunchy, this is true. The nice thing is it's fairly extensible and modular so the system embraces customization.
[16:40:13] <pussipupu> I just dislike things like the skill system being very flattening
[16:40:41] <pussipupu> And some specific things, like focussing everything on single attributes for casters and stuff
[16:40:56] <pussipupu> (for ranged spells, rather than making things by (ranged-)touch attack
[16:41:33] <lalia> Sure, that makes sense. I had a deep fondness for the old psionics casting system for some of the reasons you just mentioned.
[16:41:35] <pussipupu> I realise it's personal preference, but almost all of the differences I prefer the choices made for 3.5
[16:42:11] <pussipupu> There is an UA psionics system for 5th ed, which shows promise but also is completely broken if you play it as written
[16:42:33] <pussipupu> Though it did, in our last escapade, lead me to be a new and exciting form of hive mind
[16:43:00] <pussipupu> (There may have been a degree of Illithid neural tissue consumption involved)
[16:43:05] <lalia> I personally prefer mechanics for games like Burning Wheel as a foundation for narrative play and then import combat mechanics from other systems if it seems like there need to be crunchier/grittier rules for action encounters.
[16:43:29] <lalia> But my players often would rather default to 5e or Pathfinder.
[16:43:50] <pussipupu> I don't know Burning Wheel to be honest, I'd personally go for things based on the WW systems or play things like L5R or roll my own, but everyone already knows D&D
[16:43:55] *** Joins: RFIDtag (~RFIDtag@31.207.58.209)
[16:44:00] <pussipupu> Which especially over the Intertubes makes a huge difference
[16:45:04] <lalia> Burning Wheel (especially as instantiated in Mouse Guard) has exceptionally novel character hooks for narrative motivation and the conflict resolution system is a ton of fun.
[16:45:21] <lalia> WW's system variations are great too tho.
[16:45:34] <lalia> I'm fond of a few of their family of settings as well.
[16:45:41] <arryana> yay, rfid!
[16:45:47] <RFIDtag> arryana: hey!!
[16:45:55] <rindolf> WW?
[16:45:56] <pussipupu> Me too though probably somewhat nichely especially of Æon
[16:45:59] <pussipupu> RFiD?
[16:46:08] <RFIDtag> pussipupu: that's me. :-)
[16:46:21] <pussipupu> Oh sorry apparently I'm literally blind
[16:46:28] <lalia> I think Crux has used a version of their LARP mechanics before and had positive reviews too.
[16:46:39] <RFIDtag> pussipupu: it's okay. It happens, I know.
[16:46:41] <lalia> rindolf: White Wolf.
[16:47:06] <RFIDtag> arryana: how are you? And it's nice to see you on LiberaChat!
[16:47:40] <raincomplex> i think 5e becomes a lot more comprehensible if you see it as "the rules support the fantasy" instead of "the rules create the fantasy"

[16:47:52] <ro-bot-o> [url] 725: Literally - explain xkcd | www.explainxkcd.com
[16:48:06] <raincomplex> 5e asks you to trust yourself more
[16:48:35] <raincomplex> to come up with things on your own
[16:48:36] <pussipupu> Fair enough, but then I'd go for something rules-light
[16:48:38] <arryana> i'm good, how's you!
[16:48:43] <rindolf> lalia: i see
[16:48:54] <pussipupu> 5e D&D to me feels both rules-heavy and lacking in nuance
[16:49:09] <pussipupu> Maybe I just play with rules-lawyers though :þ

[16:49:30] <dartmouthed> Thanks, ro-bot-o
[16:49:33] <dartmouthed> <botsnack
[16:49:40] <raincomplex> another pattern in 5e is they designed it so that there are some underlying intuitions not explicitly spelled out, which you get by playing it a bunch
[16:49:49] <dartmouthed> Mmmh. I wish we could give snacks to the bot
[16:49:55] <lalia> The streamlining is meant to convey a more intense and video-game like pace from what I've read the devs say. This means your intuitions are correct according to the design team, pussipupu. :)
[16:50:20] <pussipupu> lalia: console rather than PC game is the analogy I normally use
[16:50:31] <pussipupu> And I don't personally see that as a good thing :þ
[16:50:32] <lalia> Yeah, that's the idea. Spot on. :)
[16:50:42] <raincomplex> for example, they never say explicitly "things in general don't stack" -- but see advantage/disadvantage, vulnerable/resistant, and the section called something like "combining magical effects"
[16:51:30] <lalia> pussipupu: Are you familiar with the Dungeon World mechanics? It's based on a rules-lite version of the Powered by the Apocalypse system.

[16:52:30] <RFIDtag> arryana: I'm doing well! How are you? How's the Suburban? And the dogs? LOL.
[16:52:35] <rindolf> i've realised that [ franchise =~ ideasystem ]
[16:53:12] <lalia> Sure, the crunch vs fluff narrative is a longstanding interest for me. I'm never sure where I stand because my experience depends largely on the group I play with.
[16:53:19] <lalia> So I'm interested in all angles of the debate.
[16:53:25] <pussipupu> I do wish I had a physical gaming group, for the combat side of things I really like minis and I have a 3d printer now which would open up a lot of interesting options for me
[16:53:37] <raincomplex> i think crunch/fluff depends on what you count as "real"
[16:54:14] <arryana> the suburban is in the shop, sadly
[16:54:16] <raincomplex> if the imaginative aspect of simulating a world in your mind is the basis for the game world, then the "rules" are fluff
[16:54:21] <lalia> Sure, another way to go at it is thinking of the difference as distingushing interactive storytelling groups from wargame-based players.
[16:54:25] <q-q> hello
[16:54:28] <arryana> we just got her absolutely, totally perfect, then sent her in for a full fluid service
[16:54:37] <lalia> heya q-q. o/
[16:54:41] <arryana> which we figured was a better idea to do where they could safely dispose of the fluids.
[16:54:49] <raincomplex> i think 5e actually does a really good job of finding a middle ground there
[16:54:56] <arryana> however, some ignoramus filled her engine with 30/5, and she spun a bearing
[16:54:57] <q-q> my i ask you guys a opinion on a social topic?
[16:55:03] <arryana> so she's being rebuilt at their cost

[16:55:29] <lalia> q-q: sure! :) we're just chatting about tabletop, a topic change would be totally welcome.
[16:55:39] <q-q> what do you guys think of richard delgado and derrick bell on critical race theory?
[16:56:26] <pussipupu> I have no opinion on that, sorry
[16:56:36] <q-q> none at all?
[16:56:37] <raincomplex> to be fair, i think you can run basically any system in a more narrative style. it depends on your perspective on gameplay
[16:56:46] <dartmouthed> Critical Race Theory? Into the trash it goes
[16:57:13] <rindolf> i am not a "randroid" - prejudice loses again (there are xkcdroids too): https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/culture/case-for-commercial-fan-fiction/indiv-nodes/guidelines_as_dogma.xhtml

[16:57:22] <pussipupu> I don't know who they are, and have only a vague awareness of CRT
[16:57:22] <q-q> dartmouthed: people who talk about equal rights and equality also seem to like critical race theory
[16:57:26] <pussipupu> So none at all
[16:57:28] <q-q> but isnt it just the opposite?
[16:57:55] <raincomplex> for me, rpgs boil down to the loop of narration between the gm and the players. everything else is basically genre :D
[16:58:57] <pussipupu> I find that having the rules there to provide internal consistency allows the book-keeping to fade into the background, so the story can be got on with
[16:58:58] <lalia> q-q: I'm not familar with these figures, sadly. I'm familiar with critical race theory, especially the recent dramatics around the idea in the US, tho. :D
[16:59:15] <q-q> isnt it just racism by itself?
[16:59:20] <pussipupu> Collective story-telling is the key to me, I think we just have different preferences  for how to deal with that
[16:59:51] <raincomplex> i agree that rules help provide consistency, although i think it can definitely be taken too far
[17:00:08] <pussipupu> Maybe I should set up an RPG-enforced MineTest server, that might help scratch the itch
[17:00:26] <raincomplex> things like this for example: https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/Pushing_the_Speed_Limit_(5e_Optimized_Character_Build)
[17:00:27] <ro-bot-o> [url] Pushing the Speed Limit (5e Optimized Character Build) - D&D Wiki | www.dandwiki.com
[17:00:45] <raincomplex> note especially "the rail gun"
[17:00:49] <pussipupu> Oh munchkins are a problem but that's a problem with munchkins
[17:00:59] <pussipupu> And that's why you drop boulders on them until they stop :þ
[17:01:17] <lalia> q-q: coming from a background of feminist theory as developed by folks like Crenshaw, Davis, and hooks gives me the impression that critical race theory traditionally means to inquire after and criticise instutional and systematic racism or other kinds of oppression through marginalization.
[17:01:19] <raincomplex> but see to me it's not a problem with the players but the way the rules are enforced
[17:01:34] <raincomplex> that's why i love "the rail gun"
[17:02:08] <dartmouthed> rindolf, I don't care. Nobody cares. If you list a lolbertarian psycho like Rand in your blog as your main influence, you're a randroid. If that somehow hurts your feefees, then it's your problem :^)
[17:02:09] <raincomplex> bc it highlights how ludicrous it is to interpret the reaction rules as allowing arbitrarily fast movement
[17:02:14] <lalia> So it wouldn't be racism at face value as a theoretical framework unless an individual self-proclaimed advocate presents a variety of such a stance with clearly racist points. :D
[17:02:26] <raincomplex> instead of just saying "well obviously you can only move this character 20 ft per round" or w/e
[17:02:43] <pussipupu> I had a build for the d20 Wheel of Time setting that had infinite casting at level 3
[17:03:28] <pussipupu> And utter psychological collapse within a few months probably, but something something candles burning bright something
[17:03:42] <q-q> lalia: critical race theory and its first creator Richard Delgado and derrick bell both had said in practice it would be systematic racism against white people for a return on how white people had treated other minorities. they claimed institutional segregation and degradation on white people and their property would be necessary to make equality and empower minorities.
[17:04:04] <raincomplex> the general vector of my argument is that intuition is as important as rationality. if you follow rules without context, you end up in weird places
[17:04:30] <rindolf> dartmouthed: i care that you don't care andjump t o conclusions: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Care_Bears

[17:05:39] <dartmouthed> Typical randroid
[17:06:22] <lalia> q-q: not sure about their take, but it sounds sketchy and problematic. Roy Brooks is actually typically credited with coming up with critical race theory, TBH, and I also don't know about that take on it very well. As I already indicated, I'm mainly familiar with folks like Crenshaw, Davis, and hooks. Sara Ahmed is another figure I tend to abide by across narratives like these.
[17:06:22] <dartmouthed> You are slightly more amusing than bothersome, lolbert
[17:06:33] <rindolf> dartmouthed: who is john galt? ;)
[17:06:34] <dartmouthed> It's the only thing keeping me from /ignore ing you
[17:07:13] <q-q> lalia: if not the creators, they are credited as first coining the term and giving it meaning, they also are the driving force on its popularity

[17:11:20] <pussipupu> Oh that reminds me, dogs are exceptionally good at distinguishing real yawns from fake ones and catch real yawns
[17:11:30] <pussipupu> Psychopaths don't catch yawns
[17:11:44] <lalia> Sojourner Truth, Frederick Douglass, and W. E. B. DuBois are all familiar foundational figures for what gets called "critical race theory" too, from my educational experience, q-q.
[17:11:46] <pussipupu> Ergo: Dogs can be used as stochastic psychopath detectors
[17:11:57] <badsektor> hmmm my dog doesn't catch my yawn
[17:12:11] <pussipupu> I need to read some Truth, would you be able to suggest something, lalia?
[17:12:12] <dartmouthed> Could the dog be the psycho?, pussipupu
[17:12:18] <rindolf> dartmouthed: your link is not too amusing
[17:12:24] <pussipupu> Yeah but only other dogs would be able to tell
[17:12:32] <lalia> I can ask a few feminist scholar friends for clarity, I guess. Apologies for not being familiar with these particular figures, q-q. Makes it tough to offer relevant comments for the context.
[17:12:37] <dartmouthed> I'm looking up something more interesting, rindolf
[17:12:41] <pussipupu> Basically I'm calling for Canocracy
[17:12:46] <q-q> CRT originated in the mid-1970s in the writings of several American legal scholars, including Derrick Bell, Alan Freeman, Kimberlé Crenshaw, Richard Delgado, Cheryl Harris, Charles R. Lawrence III, Mari Matsuda, and Patricia J. Williams
[17:12:52] <dartmouthed> pussipupu, mmmh. Interesting
[17:13:40] <q-q> lalia: i have citations showing it is from the 70s
[17:13:42] <lalia> Ain't I A Woman is arguably the best place to start, pussipupu. :)
[17:13:54] <q-q> and was driven mostly by derrik bell.
[17:13:54] <pussipupu> Cheers
[17:14:09] <pussipupu> And yes that was mentioned in her HoPWaG episode now I think of it
[17:14:13] <pussipupu> What are you citations?
[17:14:28] <rindolf> i wrote a parody of the Fountainhead: https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/TOneW-the-Fountainhead/

[17:15:41] <q-q> s/was/is/
[17:15:41] <ro-bot-o> q-q meant to say: lalia: he even states that racism is ordinary.
[17:15:43] <dartmouthed> rindolf, you really are starved for attention
[17:15:49] <lalia> q-q: again, that's great... I can offer citations with contrary points which may help with clarifying our confusion some. There isn't going to be an easily settled discussion to be had on points of origin becuase it appears to be in heavy dispute even among academic scholars.
[17:16:03] <rindolf> dartmouthed: i am not
[17:16:08] <q-q> lalia: i have not found any proof of it being disputed
[17:16:25] <q-q> infact it seems that everyone quotes derrik bell specifically in the creation of critical race theory
[17:16:25] <lalia> Feel free to offer the lines and whatnot tho, especially if you've got a particular point you're interested in clarifying.
[17:16:27] <pussipupu> lalia: This conversation backs up my theory that the channel would benefit from a forum or something :þ
[17:16:44] <pussipupu> Possibly something running on the everything2 engine or similar
[17:17:04] <q-q> pussipupu: sub chat groups with its own irc network would be cool
[17:17:08] <lalia> q-q: sounds like you've got a project you're working on with a particular reading of this tradition in development. Good luck too.
[17:17:22] <arryana> yeah
[17:17:24] <lalia> Not my bag, TBH.
[17:17:27] <pussipupu> q-q: I don't know what “sub chat groups” is
[17:17:27] <pussipupu> But maybe
[17:17:28] <arryana> i agree, pussipupu

[17:17:55] <q-q> even ##philosophy argument area
[17:17:57] <pussipupu> Oh, other channels? Why would that need a specific network?
[17:18:12] <q-q> pussipupu: no different then a forum.
[17:18:17] <badsektor> i have an unpopular opinion on crt
[17:18:19] <lalia> epizza sounds low-calorie, TBH. :D
[17:18:20] <pussipupu> I'd be in favour of breaking out conversations into other channels for clarity and reducing crosstalk

[17:19:41] <lalia> I'm not a Discord hater: I've had too much success with the community.
[17:19:41] <pussipupu> The Matrix “Spaces” feature has promise for this kind of thing, but I still say that a partnered forum and possibly e2 or wiki or something would be useful
[17:19:45] <arryana> why feel badly, just go for a nine mile run

[17:20:33] <lalia> Discord has made it possible for me to lead two major classics reading groups and I've been around to organize a ton of academic opportunities.

[17:20:52] <arryana> yeah, that's the one i have my hopes on
[17:20:54] <badsektor> the platform is actually perfect for debating, because you can post images, and you can post links that will be given a preview automnatically, and a voice chat room is always available

[17:21:33] <pussipupu> I rarely want voice chat, but all of those are true of Matrix to be fair
[17:21:43] <lalia> My buddy Gogol did a bioethics presentation on Biocord and like a hundred people showed up. Amazing exchange, I really found it rewarding.
[17:22:04] <pussipupu> And because it's not a propriatory system it escapes many of the traps and doesn't lock you into a specific(broken) client
[17:22:04] <lalia> So ideally... Matrix. But I need the people to be there too.
[17:22:15] <badsektor> isnt matrix a russian thing?
[17:22:16] <dartmouthed> Somewhere in there there is a summary of EVERY chapter of Atlas Shrugged, for those who would like to peek into the psychotic mind of Rand without having to read a doorstop
[17:22:24] <pussipupu> Yeah, and don't get me wrong, I'm glad people are getting access to good communitie
[17:22:41] <pussipupu> I've read 85% of Atlas Shrugged
[17:22:59] <arryana> voice chat always appeals as a concept to me, but i find it nearly impossible to use in function
[17:23:01] <pussipupu> s/ie/ies/
[17:23:01] <ro-bot-o> pussipupu meant to say: Yeah, and don't get me wrong, I'm glad people are getting access to good communities
[17:23:04] <arryana> if you have to key a mic, i can't do it
[17:23:10] <pussipupu> Oh, forgot the bot did that
[17:23:16] <badsektor> dartmouthed, i been a libertarian for a very long time, and i never read ayn rand, i think people who read her novels identify themselves with the John Galt character and act like emotionaless robots, and thats very annoying i didnt want to be that
