[11:28:46] <gerikson> oh god

[11:29:40] <kline> about a year ago now (has it been that long?) moonchild turned off xul anyway for the same reason mozilla did: its a beast to maintain

[11:31:45] <kline> gerikson, the branding thing is to do with anything thats not an official binary release

[11:32:05] <kline> the _only_ official palemoon is the binaries they distribute
[11:32:44] <kline> if you build from source you cannot use the branding because you've not done an official build, and pretty much no distro worth a damn is willing to blindly package source-unseen binaries

[11:41:50] <riv> Wallops from JackFrost (ukikie@libera/staff/unit193): Join us in congratulating Slackware on their latest release!  Version 15.0 is a milestone release with 5 years in the making, read more at: http://www.slackware.com/announce/15.0.php
[11:41:50] <mockturtle> [ The Slackware Linux Project: Slackware Release Announcement ] - www.slackware.com
[11:41:53] <riv> lmao
[11:42:06] <riv> now we're gettin version bumps through IRC op announcements
[11:42:31] <riv> god dont let the xmake  or oil shell guys become ircops here
[11:43:45] <kline> slackware: once in 5.5 years
[11:43:51] <kline> oil: monthly retros
[11:43:55] <gerikson> slackware releases get a lot of ... slack
[11:44:29] <gerikson> A buddy of mine ran slackware and introd me to linux, but when it came time for me to install I chose debian
[11:44:34] <gerikson> dunno why, really
[11:44:43] <gerikson> maybe because slack was "too hard" even then
[11:44:48] <gerikson> this was '96 or something
[11:44:57] <gerikson> been on the apt train ever since
[11:45:03] <gerikson> sorry dpkg
[11:45:19] <kline> i think a lot of people have a place for slack, i never did use it but loads of people came out the woodwork talking nostalgic about it
[11:45:39] <gerikson> yeah
[11:46:01] <gerikson> "it's a real unix" which kinda tells you "real unix" is kinda useless ;)
[11:46:09] <gerikson> seeing slack never took the world by storm
[11:46:30] <wink> i think it was a huge catalyst
[11:46:37] <wink> in the mid-90s at least
[11:46:53] <gerikson> I'm sure
[11:47:00] <gerikson> I used to be a huge Linux fanboy then
[11:47:02] <wink> I mean, I bought some Red Hat and SuSE CDs in 98
[11:47:18] <wink> and I faintly remember slackware being mentioned all the time
[11:47:43] <wink> I don't think it would've been a good start
[11:47:57] <wink> just RH/SuSE was rough enough as your first linux
[11:48:01] <jmiven> so, is Slackware to Red Hat what Smalltalk is to Java? :-P
[11:48:09] <gerikson> I installed Debian from floppies
[11:48:16] <gerikson> talk about rough ;)
[11:48:20] <iDrougge> jmiven: No, more like Java and C#.
[11:48:26] <wink> the CDs were on magazines. I had no one to download me floppies :d

[12:12:17] <wink> have to admit this was archaic even in the 80s.
[12:13:00] <wink> but don't worry, people just called it "a telephone"
[12:13:05] <gerikson> still think the Norwegian name kringkastning is the best

[12:14:37] <gerikson> huh
[12:14:57] <wink> no I meant the Kompaktfernsprechapparat. nobody really said that
[12:15:15] <gerikson> ok
[12:15:18] <wink> but also all the tanks and stuff in WW2. PzKpfW 6 aka the Tiger Tank

[12:15:40] <wink> Panzerkampfwagen, aka Tank Battle Vehicle
[12:15:46] <gerikson> kpist for kulsprutepistol
[12:16:46] <gerikson> I think becasue militaries were among the first to have to standardize logistics they had to come up with the first "SKUs" and it kinda shows
[12:16:52] <wink> but I also find it interesting that our laws usually have the most boring names in their acronyms and Americans often backronym it to a catchy name
[12:17:04] <gerikson> that's just marketing
[12:17:16] <gerikson> PATRIOT act
[12:17:19] <wink> yeah, but it helps bringt the term to a wider public I think
[12:17:20] <gerikson> has some expansion

[12:17:36] <wink> easier to memorize than "GDPR" or worse, the German DSGVO
[12:17:56] <wink> a good percentage misspells it as DGSVO or DSVGO
[12:18:17] <iDrougge> The latter doesn't make any sense.
[12:18:30] <iDrougge> You should at least understand that it's a VO.
[12:18:30] * varjag has managed to misspell GDPR in his only viral tweet
[12:18:48] <gerikson> did every PTS rent out phone terminals?
[12:18:58] <gerikson> I know Bell did in the US, and Televerket in Sweden
[12:19:20] <wink> I think you rented them, yes
[12:19:24] <gerikson> German Democratic People's Republic? ;)
[12:19:36] <wink> also the modems, and you were not allowed to tamper with them
[12:19:37] <gerikson> thinkginug bakc, that's so weird
[12:20:05] <gerikson> in the late 80s people purchased phones from like .. Germany and plugged them in , and it was technically illegal
[12:20:24] <wink> hehe
[12:20:40] <wink> I kinda missed that. We got ISDN in 98 and we bought those
[12:20:57] <wink> so I think it was abolished when our post was  privatized and split into Post and Deutsche Telekom

[14:09:14] <earthy> somwhere in the 1980's the laws changed so that you could connect up your own phones, and in the late '80s that started to become generally used. That's also roughly the time that ISDN was becoming readily available.
[14:13:04] <wink> so probably same time as in Germany, but I was too young
[14:13:46] <gerikson> yeah seesm to have been a pan-Euro movment
[14:14:07] <wink> I mean, "ISDN has been around" is not the same as "anyone you know has it"
[14:14:28] <wink> we were very early in 98, it felt like, but again driven by having a company office in our house
[14:14:37] <wink> I know of other people talking about 96

[14:19:57] <wink> Swedish design as well
[14:19:58] <earthy> I was old enough to get my own phone line in '95, and upgraded that to ISDN quite quickly later (when ISDN was less than twice the price of a regular phone line), as a stable 128 kbps was *much* better than a flaky 56.6...

[14:21:00] <earthy> ofcourse, having the ability to stay connected to the internet while making a phone call was also quite useful. :)

[22:44:01] <nur> what is cba
[22:44:18] <riv> cant be assed
[22:45:07] <companion_cube> also, C makes it a pain to write *anything*, since you have so little at your disposal
[22:45:45] <nur> Yes which is why we don't use it unless absolutely necessary.
[22:45:49] <gerikson> isn't Lua super simple too
[22:45:56] <pe> And also super painful.
[22:46:33] <nur> I would reach for golang or python before rust though
[22:46:55] <gerikson> it looks like Go is the go-to (lol) for unix stuff that's not low-level nowadays
[22:46:57] <companion_cube> if you don't want a GC there's little choice
[22:47:24] <nur> I don't mind GC
[22:47:53] <riv> smart kid move: Hmm i have to do C at school, I know I'll learn this fancy new thing that im more interested in even though it's much harder - and somehow use this skill to solve the homework problems
[22:47:54] <companion_cube> then you probably don't need C indeed
[22:48:10] <gerikson> I don't get the GC hate
[22:48:15] <gerikson> truly
[22:48:33] <riv> this worked because you are (1) already very smart and could easily just learn C and solve the problems that way (2) interested in rust which makes it fun to learn
[22:48:38] <pe> GCs make the program run unpredictably.
[22:48:45] <riv> this wont work for people that don't care about rust
[22:48:55] <pe> It can be quite annoying when debugging.

[22:49:59] <technomancy> gerikson: I figure 90% of the time it's a superiority complex

[22:50:29] <gerikson> technomancy: yeah me too ,but I'm not C-fluent so I don't wanna presume
[22:50:56] <nur> I feel like Rust targets a very narrow niche of people who somehow have a problem with easier GC languages but also don't want to do C/C++
[22:51:02] <technomancy> gerikson: 90% when you're talking about non-microcontroller contexts anyway
[22:51:11] <gerikson> yeha
[22:51:19] <gerikson> or stuff like audio processing
[22:51:24] <technomancy> nur: such as writing a browser, and ... /me strains hard to think of another example
[22:51:26] <companion_cube> nur: why is that a small niche
[22:51:28] <riv> 'a problem with GC' is a weird way to put it
[22:51:47] <companion_cube> not wanting to do C++ is pretty reasonable if you want to get shit done and are not already a C++ expert
[22:51:53] <riv> sometimes GC is good.. sometimes it'd not
[22:52:05] <gerikson> dumb question but can you write C++ so that it effectively has GC?
[22:52:19] <gerikson> or is manual memory management required?
[22:52:19] <companion_cube> depends on whether you count basic refcounting as GC

[22:52:59] <companion_cube> I guess so then, just use shared_ptr everywhere

[22:53:19] <nur> I'm no C++ expert but I'd rather do C++ than Rust, maybe I'm just annoyed by the Rust fanbois telling everyone "it's a crime to do C++"
[22:53:20] <riv> I think that you can write C++ that never needs new or delete (which are used instead of C's malloc and free)
[22:53:31] <riv> and in fact this is good, if you can manage it, in C++

[22:54:12] <gerikson> riv: thx
[22:54:14] <companion_cube> nur: I'm divided on the choice personally, but I'd definitely consider rust easier than C++

[22:54:37] <companion_cube> lol no
[22:54:41] <riv> in terms of writing a program that doesn't crash...
[22:54:47] <riv> the answer may be different there
