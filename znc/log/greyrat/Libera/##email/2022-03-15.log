[00:01:52] <foo> rob0: thanks, root domain meaning domain.com not sub.domain.com - yeah, I'm digging them up now. But to confirm my understanding, I think for an mx record on a subdomain (sub.rootdomain.com) to send email from @rootdomain.com , the DKIM/SPF needs to be properly configured on subdomain AND root domain - correct? Or is subdomain alone sufficient? 
[00:02:01] <foo> We had an oversight in the past and want to make sure I'm understanding the dynamics here
[00:02:04] * foo digs through some docs in the interim 
[00:02:21] <rob0> wait, which one of these do you own?
[00:03:17] <rob0> if you mean an example domain, there is example.com for that, but don't switch to different examples unless you are talking about a different domain

[00:28:57] <foo> Pretty sure my answer is yes: I need a proper spf on the root-level domain which says which subdomains are acceptable
[00:37:17] <foo> Maybe to back up a bit... I'm a bit rusty, about to set up a recurring process to email people. I want to make sure our set up with mailgun is as "good as it can be" - I have SPF set up. Wondering what else I can do here. I think the only other 2 "methods" are DKIM and DMARC
[00:47:49] <micah> jelly: yeah, exactly

[16:15:57] <merpaderp> no at this particular point in time, no, but I am working on getting it done
[16:16:09] <merpaderp> it's major PITA, even more so than email itself
[16:16:31] <merpaderp> partially because my DNS is dynamic af, so has to be signed on the fly and that requires having same keys on all my NS'es
[16:24:16] <rob0> Once DNSSEC is working well, DANE is not much extra bother.
[16:24:47] <rob0> If the NS hosts are dynamic, ugh, that's insane.
[16:26:32] <merpaderp> yeap
[16:26:48] <merpaderp> it is insane to get it working, after that ansible playbook it and add/remove hosts as you like
[16:26:51] <merpaderp> at least in theory
[16:27:40] <merpaderp> that is only for my personal business, at $work we have it sane with single DNS master and single keys for DNSSEC.
[16:28:09] <lunaphyte> that's not the problem
[16:28:15] <merpaderp> what is then?
[16:29:00] <lunaphyte> the problem is when the ip address changes, the ns records [and perhaps glue records] have to be updated, and until all caches catch up, you have broken dns each time it happens
[16:29:58] <merpaderp> nah, my NS IPs don't change, I rent 3 dollar VPS'es for that
[16:30:10] <merpaderp> that would indeed be annoying
[16:30:37] <lunaphyte> oh, so your nameservers don't have dynamic ip addresses then
[16:30:49] <merpaderp> no, that would indeed be insane
[16:31:16] <merpaderp> with dynamic I meant that in NA continent you get resolved to VPS in NA, and in EU you get resolved to EU VPS - dynamic DNS
[16:31:56] <merpaderp> well, that's email unrelated, so far I have setup spf, dkmi and dmarc ( all DNS related )
[16:32:50] <merpaderp> then DANE is left, which kinda puts a public certificate into TLSA record
[16:33:15] <lunaphyte> oh.  that's not dynamic dns
[16:33:41] <merpaderp> ddns is when you use some API to update DNS records?
[16:33:47] <lunaphyte> no
[16:34:00] <lunaphyte> well, sort of [unfortunately]
[16:34:06] <lunaphyte> dynamic dns is rfc 2136
[16:35:47] <lunaphyte> then there's also the various non-standard apis that some dns services offer their users, which they also decided to call "dynamic dns"
[16:35:50] <merpaderp> its like the opposite of axfr
[16:35:58] <merpaderp> right
[16:36:06] <lunaphyte> i'm not sure how it's the opposite of axfr.  it has nothing to do with that
[16:38:47] <merpaderp> because before I update my dns with nsupdate, I do AXFR to get the zone I am about to edit.
[16:39:44] <lunaphyte> i suppose you could say that in your case, axfr precedes ddns operations then
[16:39:56] <lunaphyte> that's quite different than "the opposite" :)
[16:40:29] <rob0> why would axfr be needed?  Why not just query the records you want to change?
[16:41:33] <lunaphyte> people love their antipatterns :)
[16:41:39] <merpaderp> what if there are multiple records I want to change? 
[16:41:59] <merpaderp> I use dnsvi for that, in high level it does axfr and pipes into vim
[16:42:04] <rob0> query as many as you need

[16:53:13] <lunaphyte> i can more or less appreciate using tools like dnsvi
[16:53:57] <merpaderp> yea, if only order and comments would be preserved
[16:54:47] <lunaphyte> you need to get over that ;)
[16:55:22] <lunaphyte> comments can still be present, if it's really that critical [hint - it's probably not], using txt records, for example
[16:56:18] <merpaderp> that is actually good idea
[16:56:25] <merpaderp> need an rfc for that
[17:02:07] <lunaphyte> and - if you stop trying to use legacy interactive processes, and embrace programmatic practices and declarative/immutable infrastructure, you'd find that you can maintain your zone data in exactly the traditional sense that you desire, with comments, structure, etc., and still use ddns :)
[17:19:11] <rob0> I save the files I use for nsupdate
[17:19:30] <rob0> and those have comments, and filenames which describe the purpose
