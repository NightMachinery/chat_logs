[11:48:28] <mario-goulart> Does anybody see foof in the Cc field of the message I sent to chicken-users yesterday?
[12:07:21] <sjamaan> Nope
[12:17:19] *** Joins: rgherdt (~rgherdt@2a02:8109:86c0:d8d:505:5669:c90d:82dc)
[12:18:31] <mario-goulart> Thanks sjamaan 
[12:18:47] <mario-goulart> What the hell.  I think gnus is broken.
[12:20:42] <mario-goulart> This is from my outgoing mailbox: http://parenteses.org/mario/misc/a555e926742b144034454eb5b0094308096f30c8.png
[12:22:48] <sjamaan> Maybe the mailing list is stripping the CC header?  I've never seen it do that before, though
[12:23:41] <mario-goulart> That'd be very weird indeed.
[12:29:21] <mario-goulart> Crazy.  Judging by the documentation of the function I used, it was user error (i.e., I screwed up): https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/emacs.git/tree/lisp/gnus/gnus-msg.el#n1182
[12:29:59] <sjamaan> I don't get it, your screenshot _shows_ the header
[12:31:19] <mario-goulart> Yeah, but apparently the function doesn't care about it and only uses the `To' field, which is automatically determined.
[12:31:52] <sjamaan> Huh? It doesn't store a copy of the mail _just before_ sending it out?
[12:32:00] <sjamaan> That's really broken

[13:00:44] <mario-goulart> It gets weirder.  According to the trace of SMTP, the Cc header was sent.
[13:04:41] *** Joins: shawnw (~shawn_w@c-73-225-121-73.hsd1.wa.comcast.net)
[13:05:33] <mario-goulart> From http://parenteses.org/mario/misc/cc.txt it looks like Cc was respected.
[13:06:38] <mario-goulart> So my interpretation of gnus' code was wrong.  Now it looks to me like mailman is stripping Cc.
[13:18:01] <mario-goulart> Gah, it was mailman: "Filter out duplicate messages to list members (if possible) specifies whether members who are explicitly listed as a recipient of a message (e.g. via the Cc: header) will also get a copy from Mailman."
[13:18:13] <mario-goulart> That option is set for chicken-users.
[13:18:57] <mario-goulart> Mystery solved, I guess.  E-mail is hard.
[13:22:13] <sjamaan> ahh
[13:22:31] <sjamaan> That's actually a nice feature, and I kind of knew that was there now that I think about it
[13:22:50] <sjamaan> Well, I'm off for some groceries
