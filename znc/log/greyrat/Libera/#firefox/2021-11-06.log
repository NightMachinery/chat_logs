[00:09:28] <bugweiser> tried f11
[00:09:37] <bugweiser> alt-tab doesn't do anything eiter
[00:10:31] <mefistofeles> that's weird
[00:12:08] <bugweiser> I selected text in google search-bar, firefix (I think) registered it as dragging. I think it waits for a drag-end which is never gonna occur. 
[00:12:36] <bugweiser> a small grey bar without text appeared below the address bar
[00:12:43] <Zelouille> I have a bug sometimes, after dragging a tab, where the toolbar becomes unresponsive to clicks (though F6 or Ctrl+L still works). To leave that bugged state, i need to find a tab that I can move and drag it a bit. Then everything comes back to normal.
[00:13:17] <bugweiser> the window title changed and sayd something like "select element to drag"
[00:13:44] <bugweiser> at that point it stopped listening to key inputs and mouse clicks
[00:14:03] <Zelouille> The Esc key usually cancel a drag. But I'm sure you already tried that.
[00:14:05] <bugweiser> the openbsd system is having interupts at 96%
[00:14:12] <bugweiser> yeah, i tried esc
[00:15:10] <bugweiser> desperately hoping to get firefox out of polling, I noticed I could rightclick on the title-bar, and the only option that appeard to might do something was 'fullscreen'.
[00:15:14] <bugweiser> so I did that.
[00:15:42] <bugweiser> now i was stuck with a fullscreen firefox
[00:16:16] <bugweiser> I could get to xfce4 popup menu (using ctrl esc).
[00:17:07] <bugweiser> I can open another firefox but it is acting very weird, no back/forward/home buttons, no tab-foldout button. 
[00:17:54] <bugweiser> using the broken new firefox instance (with the old hanging one still running) I could use the address bar to "switch to tab" in the hanging fullscreen firefox.
[00:18:08] <bugweiser> but only if I know the address.
[00:18:50] <bugweiser> this is driving me mad.. to know my data is still in there and I don't know of any way to access it..
[00:19:29] <bugweiser> in the old days on windows I could at least use hexedit to open the process memory and hunt for my data..
[00:20:05] <Zelouille> bugweiser: I would just kill firefox and restore the session, if it's not already set up to do it automatically. What data are you talking about ? Tabs ? Form content ?
[00:20:18] <bugweiser> form content. Code in textarea

[01:40:32] <Woodsman> but when i follow instructions and go to menu, troubleshooting its not exactly the same as the video
[01:41:11] <Woodsman> and the wording is different and leaves me guessing, last thing I want to do is lose passwords and preferences and cookies in fact thats the problem i cant get to where I want to,just white screen and I cant lose that information
[01:42:27] <Woodsman> so when i go to menu, troubleshooting it says refresh firefox, but it goes on to say I will lose add-ons and customization and restore browser to default, that's not worded very good
[01:42:36] <Woodsman> I just want to keep things the way they were and fix my issue
[01:42:40] <Woodsman> please advise

[08:28:27] <bugweiser> this really isn't my day. Out of the blue firefox refuses to do things, says it has been updated in the background (GRRRRRR die autoupdate DIE).  And obviously they lie as always that it will restart and everything will come back.  So after restart there is 1 firefox process, and a bunch of tabs that can't be clicked/selected/activated (kinda obvious when there is just one process). 
[08:28:33] <bugweiser> restarted firefox, same thing
[08:28:45] <bugweiser> so I now have no working browser, thanks firefox
[08:41:14] <bugweiser> killed firefox, waited, started firefox, tabs are gone, only a tab with the title about:session restore remains. It is empty

[11:38:23] <ede> bugweiser, re what Zelouille described. i have 2 gtk programs running all the time, that's firefox and hexchat. on different desktops. when Fx goes nuts again (120% CPU or 99% RAM *in usage* (not cache/buffer, no...)) and i switch to the desktop with hexchat (only window usually) while everything slows down sometimes i can't even type there.
[11:39:33] <ede> i can switch channels, so the window *is* the active one, only no matter how often i click into the input bar the cursor does not appear. have to Alt-Tab first (remember, no other window in that place) and then it blinks as if there was nothing.
[11:42:25] <ede> also because of general unresponsiveness (does this word even exist?) like no canvas painting while i can use other windows with no issues, xterm ofc, but also links2 -g which i use sometimes for url.open() i tend to blame Gtk's design. if a Gtk program is REALLY busy it seems to block the other ones. and i bet there are more locks in the system.

[13:53:27] <bugweiser> ede, I have similar experience it seems, but that was when stuff 'worked'. Actually, now with unveil and pledge on disable, I can easlily open 3 times more tabs, the system/firefox behaves *much* more smoothly and I can even navigate and select files for a file-input (oh the amazement) or even more amazing, firefox opens html files (I know, right.. a browser that opens html files... (locally) ).
[13:55:01] <bugweiser> Also stock firefox (from openbsd) without any modifications/tweaking on stock openbsd running stock xcfe4  was spitting *numerous* errors non-stop (predominantly falied file accesses and writing to topsitesstream (whatever that is) and console history and loads of others
[13:55:32] <bugweiser> all that stopped with the unveil and pledge on disable .. 
[13:56:03] <bugweiser> so right out of the box it was already broken to begin with, then whatever updated itself was the final straw and broke firefox completely.
[13:56:36] <ede> is this bsd? found a post on /r/ mentioning it
[13:56:46] <ede> ah
[13:56:47] <ede> :)

[13:57:07] <bugweiser> (horrible... shhht don't say I said so... )
[13:57:17] <ede> i remember when tiddlywiki started to be in need of helpers to save locally
[13:57:35] <ede> one of the workarounds was a flash button in the page even
[13:57:37] <bugweiser> ohh, yeah, I recall
[14:01:40] <ede> at least mine behaves today. i moved all tabs to about:new one by one and still had a process with 100% CPU. turned out to be the swarmsim in the next window. 2 tabs (one passive for the achievements list), but when i closed one of them the other one started eating my cpu. not even closing both and reopening helped.
[14:06:12] <bugweiser> I don't use the about:new thing. 
[14:07:04] <bugweiser> Been used to closing firefox by crashing it since forever (at least since ff12).  That way i should get my (bunch of nested) session-restore page(s)
[14:08:19] <bugweiser> though, I almost never am able to reach even that point (of intentionally crasing ff).  It usually takes care of that itself after running a month 24/7 or so..
[14:08:55] <bugweiser> anywho.. good that ff is working for you (and even me) today :)
[14:13:38] <bugweiser> ACTION continues coding mozlz4 decoder as webapp. That's gonna improve my ux thousandfold.  The wonder of being able to get my code back after firefox crashes...  I'm amazed I can't find an existing webapp.   I currently plan to decode just a buffer (that should then contain utf-8) then pass it to the browser's built-in webserver as blobURL, then the user can download the file from a hyperlink and I can load the file in an iframe where the builtin jsonviewer 
[14:14:04] <bugweiser> this should be very doable and easily auditable.

[14:29:45] <ede> things like js2html and some ajax.
[14:29:45] <bugweiser> I hear ya.. still... blame the (web) authors.. Start blaming them (justly) for assuming that your machine HAS to be no older than 1 year and it exist with the SOLE purpose of displaying their (and only their) site, using no more than 1.2 tabs ..

But in the sum of the application all these useless (out of lazyness) resource-wastes build up to ultimately overshadow the real task at hand.

[14:38:28] <bugweiser> related: youtube on google chrome (and on modern 1 year old machine) is so amazingly slow to load, that you have *ages* of time to stop the loading button. If you time that reasonably right.. only the video element loads and nothing else...  Even stupid ads don't work then :) yay.
[14:38:48] <ede> oh nice
[14:39:58] <bugweiser> and (obviously) the one thing that chrome actually really really does very good is playing youtube..  (now hands up whom can make an educated guess why that works so very good and relatively low cpu/ram lol :) )
[14:40:22] <ede> since i'm on a rather clean profile (only some pdf-dont-save because they just suck) i don't even have any blocker right now. some weeks ago i started adding addresses to my hosts. selected them in the network tab until they were gone mostly.
[14:40:37] <ede> oh well.
[14:41:01] <ede> i'm sure chrome has the code for the next generations of youtube tag fuckery built-in already
[14:41:51] <ede> did the hosts thing with a few sites in the meantime, no i have some already refusing to load because adblocker :>
[14:42:00] <bugweiser> clever (hosts, note: needs updating/maintanance).  I often use one of the shared hosts files collectively updated.
[14:42:32] <ede> i did so in the past, but then i decided to have a look myself into the market a bit
[14:43:33] <ede> i don't mind the ads, i'm really good in just ignoring them away. but i don't want to be tracked all over the web by the same companies and i don't have cpu for their stinky scripting
[14:44:48] <bugweiser> same and same. Additionally, in the large scheme of things, reputable sites often host viri through ads (unknowingly, but that doesn't help victims).
[14:45:02] <bugweiser> even the php site at some point was infected.
[14:45:32] <ede> i still don't get some US newspapers here because of GDP, like https://www.tribpub.com/gdpr/chicagotribune.com/
[14:45:40] *** Joins: shalok (~shalok@user/shalok)
[14:45:47] <ede> most of the papers listed on the HP aren't available here
[14:46:12] <shalok> Firefox crashes everytime I start it when it tries to load my previous tabs.
[14:46:30] <shalok> Anyone have any idea how to tell firefox not to try and recover my previous tabs?
[14:46:37] <bugweiser> are you on openbsd shalok ?
[14:46:46] <shalok> bugweiser: No, Ubuntu.
[14:46:46] <ede> yeah, heise had a nice article on the topic some years ago. or probably it was c't. no https, and generally not really safe. running on old software, not patched, nothing.
[14:47:37] <bugweiser> shalok, try changing profile?  Or remove your sessionrestore files ?
[14:47:55] <shalok> bugweiser: How do I remove sessionrestore files?
[14:49:34] <ede> maybe https://wiki.mozilla.org/Session_Restore#Preferences
[14:49:46] <bugweiser> /home/username/.mozilla/firefox/your_profile_dir/sessionstore-backups/
[14:49:50] <bugweiser> something like that
[14:49:54] <ede> i'm always on "restore only after been told so"
[14:50:23] <bugweiser> you could also try and edit the json with your settings (not sure where it is or if it is plain json or compressed)
[14:50:33] <ede> > Valid for Firefox 2 and 3, superseded since Version 3.5.
[14:50:45] <ede> prefs.js
[14:51:03] <bugweiser> yeah, that sounds like it (and uncompressed)
[14:51:27] <ede> i tested this year how far i can go back with the versions. 2 and 3 definitely didn't start anymore.
[14:51:47] <ede> >     This page was last modified on 22 March 2020, at 08:32.
[14:51:56] <ede> 2½ years. nice.
[14:52:10] <ede> how many releases with complete restructurings since?
[14:52:19] <bugweiser> 3.6.famous works still on y2k and xp.  You do need a so called 'roy_tam' build (otherwise ssl won't work for 98% of the sites).
[14:52:48] <shalok> bugweiser: I deleted session* and it worked. Thanks
[14:52:57] <bugweiser> shalok, you are welcome !!
[14:53:13] <ede> > Version 74.0, first offered to Release channel users on March 10, 2020
[14:53:44] <ede> oh, i just wanted to see if they even start.
[14:54:04] <ede> i think i was ablo to go back into the 20s somewhere
[14:54:30] <ede> so 2013/2014
[14:55:03] <ede> to be fair, the thing i always liked is that you just have to unpack it and it's ready to run
[14:55:54] <ede> the .deb is only system integration, also it doesn't come with an install.sh like chrome which i tested for maybe 10 minutes before i removed it forever.
[14:56:17] <bugweiser> ff4 to ff27 had *very* interesting (and *highly worrying*) bugs in the js engine. I still consider mozilla js engine superior (couse more mature) over V8. But not knowing how functions might work when run for the first time vs subsequent times is a nightmare. 
[14:56:54] <bugweiser> its when you have a simple function and call it twice with the same arguments and you get 2 different results.. 
[14:57:09] <ede> sounds... interesting ;)
[14:57:12] <bugweiser> there isn't much you can do to combat/detect that.
[14:58:16] <ede> seems they miss some init work and just keep everything around until the next cal
[14:58:18] <ede> call
[14:58:29] <ede> oh: https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1262464
[14:58:54] <ede> also, why can i select what tabs to stop using after a crash, but not during normal startup?
[14:59:19] <bugweiser> lol :)
[14:59:26] <bugweiser> let's generalise that Question..
[14:59:38] <bugweiser> why can't I pick my poison during installation...
[14:59:55] <bugweiser> do you want geo location api code in your browser? Yes/No 
[15:00:07] <bugweiser> do you want battary status code in your browser? Yes/No
[15:00:14] <ede> exactly
[15:00:43] <bugweiser> do yo want to send all your private data to this german based company called Klicz (becouse our million-dollar per year deal with google came to an end)? Yes/No ?
[15:00:46] <ede> all this should be an extra module so i could even remove it completely
[15:00:53] <bugweiser> EXACTLY
[15:01:10] <ede> cliqz, yeah
[15:01:13] <bugweiser> Then it would take it's royal status amongst developers back.
[15:01:38] <ede> i only had to read the name Burda to know that it's a shithole company (to use some politician's words)
[15:01:40] <bugweiser> Do you want to make your computer part of our drone/bot testing network so we can play with ideas on your computer? Yes/No ?
[15:02:02] <ede> i know what kind of papers they publish and... thanks no.
[15:02:43] <bugweiser> Do you want to remove mozilla politics (hidden in undocumented config) to make firefox great again? Yes/No ?
[15:02:46] <ede> i wouldn't even mind telemetry probably... but you fucking ask me first
[15:02:54] <bugweiser> indeed
[15:03:22] <ede> and if you think i have to live with it just because you're gratis... give the users the option to pay for the browser w/o all that crap.
[15:03:33] <bugweiser> Do you want to waste bandwidth/cpu/ram to prefetch every link firefox can get their (insert lord of the rings gollum quote here) on ? Yes/No?
[15:04:14] <ede> just don't do it like German press where you get a handful articles for free at most and to get behind their firewall you have to pay tens of euros per month
[15:04:36] <ede> or 1.50 for a single article if the product is like 6€ at the kiosk.
[15:05:17] <ede> sure, just preload everything
[15:05:21] <ede> including videos
[15:05:42] <ede> had a nice exampple some time ago. a short article 2 paragraphs, maybe 6 sentences.
[15:05:51] <ede> and a lot of ads around it
[15:06:05] <ede> and an endless list of "also interesting" image links
[15:06:14] <ede> and that's just the visible part
[15:07:05] <ede> next level: a dozen nesting levels. then next level: a ton of JS, a few times bigger than even the bloated html.
[15:07:38] <bugweiser> well, if we get a beutiful slick running ap (costing a ton of JS, i'd be happy) :)
[15:07:58] <ede> so to serve me 20k of plain text i'm interested in i have to download 20MB. makes sense.
[15:08:03] <bugweiser> that's what I signed up for over 22 years ago: code once run always on every platform..
[15:09:32] <ede> there are some nice projects for presentation of data of any kind... text, images, videos, timelines, graphs, even interactive.
[15:09:47] <ede> neat and slim.
[15:10:07] <bugweiser> yup, when it's done right, it just works (usually even without hogging the browser/machine).
[15:10:13] *** Quits: sharperguy (~sharpergu@fnord.cryptophone.de) (Ping timeout: 268 seconds)
[15:10:19] <ede> but firefox even asks me to activate video playback when i go to the facebook... LOGIN(!)
[15:10:36] <bugweiser> sigh.. I didn't know. I feel for ya!
[15:10:44] <ede> yeah, as i said. twitter vs nitter
[15:10:52] <bugweiser> nitter is neat :)
[15:11:18] *** Joins: sharperguy (~sharpergu@88.130.220.29)
[15:11:21] <ede> i wanted to have it open when i click a twitter link, but this doesn't work the way i'd like it to :/
[15:11:32] <ede> bloody HSTS and what not
[15:11:43] <bugweiser> oh right, that jazz
[15:12:00] <ede> $nitter_ip twitter.com
[15:12:01] <ede> done.
[15:12:16] <bugweiser> :)
[15:12:39] <ede> also on the long turn i'd like to have the usual CDN JS on my machine. won't work for the same reason i guess.
[15:13:13] <bugweiser> well, nuff bitching (though rightfully). At least today our browser works :)
[15:13:57] <ede> 11:16 to go, i won't be too load yet ;)
[15:14:55] <ede> first message during startup: ###!!! [Child][RunMessage] Error: Channel closing: too late to send/recv, messages will be lost
[15:14:59] <bugweiser> cdnjs I do something slightly similar.. I have a web-app containing my most used snippets. These I can select (including versions of those) and load them as blobURL. As long as I keep this loader-tab open, and my dev-environment runs of the same domain I can then load these snippets in other code i'm working on at that moment (simple <script src=blobURL> suffices.  That's pretty useful during dev :)
[15:15:11] <ede> and this one 3x already: ATTENTION: default value of option force_s3tc_enable overridden by environment.
[15:16:08] <ede> oh wait... time can be rewritten, amirite?
[15:16:15] <ede> err... sourcecode
[15:16:24] <bugweiser> lol :) yeah :)
[15:16:48] <ede> just redirecting the loading to my own cdn with greasemonkey or sth...
[15:17:58] <ede> sounds like something i should keep in mind for later... much later xD
[15:18:01] <bugweiser> does greasemonkey still work for sites that dictate through html headers that they don't want to be greased and no js may be inserted (etc.) ?
[15:18:32] <ede> no idea, i just tested it long ago, maybe even in the Dark Ages of XUL

[16:25:47] <susi> can I give firefox a profile folder path to force it to open it, or do I need to copy the folder under .mozilla/firefox and add the entries in profiles.ini, and then -P profile?
[16:26:43] <ede> there's --profile <PATH> not sure if the directory has to exist already
[16:27:16] <ede> though they are a bit different, more oldstyle, completely selfcontained, including cache
[16:28:11] <ede> i only don't know if there would be absolute pathtes in them, and if, is it still possible to move them around? never tested it i think.
[16:28:29] <susi> it is possible indeed
[16:28:49] <susi> but you may need to give MOZ_ALLOW_DOWNGRADE=1 (on linux) 
[16:29:14] <ede> it is a dumb decision anyway. never use absolute pathes unless you WANT to tie something to a specific location.
[16:29:22] <ede> oh
[16:30:00] <ede> there's $HOME there could es well be $MOZ_PROFILE_DIR or sth
[16:30:27] <ede> just for internal usage so it doesn't have to use absolute pathes
[16:30:34] <susi> that needs to be given on first launch only, if moving a profile from newer to older

[21:23:45] <ash_worksi> there's an option in dev tools to persist logs but some times it's cleared anyway (right now, during an oauth process)
[21:23:49] <ash_worksi> how can I keep them?
[21:25:50] <dalias> browser.uidensity = 1 fixed the wasted space. still ugly but i dont care about that

[21:40:09] <schuelermine> I just tried Firefox 94 (my repos haven’t updated yet), and it says “Available for a limited time” about Colorways. What the hell does that mean?
[21:40:35] <schuelermine> Is it planned to remove Colorways? Will the theme be reset then? Is Colorways a proprietary add-on?
