[04:33:10] <buttsbot> Beans In Things That Beans Shouldn't Be In
[04:36:10] <manicennui> /r/beans is also weird.
[04:36:21] <manicennui> I was unaware of this great bean content.
[04:37:06] <dimadima> too much content
[04:37:26] <dimadima> "content" is the word of our times
[04:37:57] * manicennui has a PBR
[04:38:05] <dimadima> the pixel 4a is strange
[04:38:22] <dimadima> well first let me start off by saying that the stock configuration feels like a google surveillance platform
[04:38:27] <dimadima> but that's not the strange bit
[04:39:00] <dimadima> the stange thing is that there are two pixel 4as. a 4g and 5g versions, and they have different screen sizes
[04:39:13] <manicennui> Poor Google just wants to improve your search results and serve you relevant ads.
[04:39:42] <dimadima> in all honestly it's amazing they get people to pay for this thing
[04:40:01] <dimadima> but who decided to have two phones, with different screen sizes, but the same "name"
[04:40:13] <manicennui> Someone paid the big bucks.
[04:40:40] <dimadima> i want to buy a case and screen protector because i've already dropped it, but i don't even know which one i bought
[04:40:51] <dimadima> and i don't have the time/energy/need per se to figure it out even
[04:40:53] <manicennui> Maybe they are a/b testing models.
[04:40:54] <dimadima> wtf
[04:41:07] <dimadima> different wireless, different screen size, same name
[04:41:16] <companion_cube> regular 4a is older, and, well, doesn't have 5g
[04:41:17] <dimadima> :head explodes:
[04:41:41] <manicennui> I've never broken a phone screen.
[04:41:42] <companion_cube> I bought a case, pretty expensive but i like it: otter box
[04:42:09] <dimadima> this is the listing i purchased: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B095PY85HG?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2_dt_b_product_details
[04:42:11] <buttsbot> Amazon.com: Google Pixel 4a - Unlocked Android Smartphone - 128 GB of Storage - Up to 24 Hour Battery - Barely Blue : Everything Else
[04:42:15] <manicennui> I don't know what you animals do to your phones.
[04:42:30] <dimadima> companion_cube: i only need a basic case and a screen protector, because it won't be my daily driver at least not for a while anyway
[04:42:55] <dimadima> manicennui: i've had to beat up iphones in a row and refuse to let that happen to my 2020 SE
[04:43:08] <manicennui> Only reason I even use cases is because the stupid camera juts out on phones now.
[04:43:11] <manicennui> And many of them are slick.
[04:43:19] <manicennui> Never used a screen protector.
[04:43:23] <dimadima> yes this phone is absolutely slick
[04:43:29] <dimadima> a screen protector has saved my 2020 SE
[04:43:37] <manicennui> I have no case on my iPhone 12. Where is your god now?
[04:43:39] <dimadima> i'm really glad i applied it
[04:43:44] <dimadima> to each their own
[04:44:04] <dimadima> i'm on my second screen protector on the SE and i'll never not use one again
[04:44:16] <manicennui> Saved it from what? The glass doesn't scratch easily.
[04:44:17] <dimadima> love having a pristene phone under there
[04:44:22] <dimadima> falls that break it
[04:44:34] <manicennui> I don't buy that screen protectors protect from falls.
[04:44:38] <dimadima> my original SE somehow cracked its screen *in my pocket*
[04:44:44] <dimadima> i took it out of my pocket and it was broken
[04:44:55] <manicennui> Probably flexed the phone.
[04:44:59] <dimadima> manicennui: i do, i think they absorb the torsion or whatever
[04:45:01] <dimadima> the stress
[04:45:04] <dimadima> manicennui: i guess so
[04:45:31] <manicennui> How is a thin layer of plastic film going to absorb anything?
[04:45:41] <dimadima> its capable of cracking
[04:45:46] <dimadima> and it cracks first
[04:46:10] <dimadima> it's not exactly plastic film. it has rigidity
[04:46:21] <dimadima> listen i can't offer proof
[04:46:37] <dimadima> but i also was skeptical until i had one
[04:46:50] <dimadima> now i'm a believer, in the literal sense of the word
[04:47:01] <dimadima> (meaning, again, i have no actual evidence)
[04:48:14] <dimadima> anyway i definitely want a case for this thing and i can't believe i can't tell which model i bought
[04:48:30] <dimadima> i'm almost certain it's the old one companion_cube said, but the listing says it has 5G
[04:48:48] <dimadima> Cellular Technology 5G
[04:48:56] <dimadima> Screen Size 5.8 Inches
[04:49:04] <dimadima> those two things contradict each other. fuck you amazon
[04:49:27] <dimadima> and i'm bitching here instead of figure it out actually
[04:54:20] <manicennui> I feel like I've figured out life other than how to get myself to do the things I want.
[04:54:44] <manicennui> Another weekend wasted.
[04:54:48] <dimadima> what do you want
[04:55:18] <dimadima> i mean to do
[04:55:42] <manicennui> It's a list of things, but none of it is difficult, and it is all within reach.
[04:55:50] <manicennui> But I just sit around and watch TV and play video games.
[04:55:55] <manicennui> Do enough not to be fired.
[04:56:20] <manicennui> The biggest thing I need to change right now is my activity level.
[04:56:27] <manicennui> Before I have a grabber.
[04:56:51] <dimadima> a lot of people are depressed
[04:57:07] <manicennui> I'm mostly over that.
[04:57:15] <manicennui> It never goes away completely.
[04:57:20] <dimadima> so what do you think it is
[04:57:27] <manicennui> Habit mostly.
[04:57:30] <manicennui> Inertia.
[04:57:41] <dimadima> and that's separate from being depressed?
[04:58:13] <manicennui> Might have been caused by depression, but after many years it is hard to break the habits and my body is a shitshow.
[04:58:32] <dimadima> do you enjoy walking?
[04:58:41] <dimadima> like some people like to just walk and walk
[04:58:49] <dimadima> some do not
[04:59:00] <manicennui> Yes, other than the fact that my body doesn't like it afterward.
[04:59:15] <manicennui> Just need to do it consistently for a while.
[04:59:19] <manicennui> Which is the problem.
[04:59:53] <dimadima> it sounds like you don't suffer from anxiety though
[05:00:04] <manicennui> Not often.
[05:00:07] <dimadima> i've never experienced pathologicial depression but i've definitely experienced pathological anxiety
[05:00:20] <dimadima> if i don't move around, i get really anxious
[05:01:46] <dimadima> what's on your list of things that you didn't do any of this weekend. like what could you have done
[05:04:48] <manicennui> Done some exercise and chores.
[05:05:59] <dimadima> 🤷
[05:06:46] <indigo> Hey dimadima :) How's your Sunday going?
[05:07:03] <dimadima> those two things are particulary subject to inertia
[05:07:17] <dimadima> indigo: good afternoon/evening indigo. pretty alright so far
[05:07:52] <dimadima> been working on screenshots/app store media for my project
[05:07:54] <dimadima> how about you?
[05:08:21] <indigo> It's all right, prepping to go on a short trip on Thursday to North Carolina
[05:08:28] <indigo> Wooo media
[05:08:32] <indigo> One man project right?
[05:08:39] <indigo> Er, *one person
[05:09:13] <dimadima> yes. it's been terrible cause i've got the app in good shape but creating fake shit for screenshots and making mockups is totally outside my domain. i spent a while learning figma today
[05:09:20] <dimadima> everyone's going to NC
[05:09:35] <dimadima> work trip?
[05:10:13] <indigo> Nah, I'm going to visit my sister; she is going to college there
[05:10:34] <indigo> TBH I don't really want to go now that my dad and his wife decided to tag along
[05:10:44] <indigo> But I guess I am needed more now that they decided to tag along :P
[05:11:57] <manicennui> indigo: Which part?
[05:12:07] <indigo> manicennui: Chapel Hill
[05:12:10] <manicennui> Ah.
[05:12:25] <manicennui> I've been to Durham, but never Chapel Hill. Heard it's nice.
[05:13:12] <indigo> We're probably going to be around Durham, Raleigh, CH
[05:13:49] <indigo> I guess yay for days off of work? I have too many projects going
[05:14:17] <indigo> Project X got deprioritized in favor of Project Y, and now folks are concerned that Project X isn't making progress fast enough
[05:14:25] <indigo> I mean... yeah
[05:18:32] <dimadima> i've only been to southern NC by myrtle beach, never inland. would like to go some time
[05:19:01] <dimadima> going to college is fun though. i wish i had an excuse to spend some time aroudn a school
[05:19:05] <dimadima> dining halls etc
[05:19:20] <dimadima> im a sucker for dining halls i haven't been eating at all the time
[05:19:35] <indigo> Ehhh I hated college haha. Between my part time job and the degree it was pretty stressful
[05:19:36] <dimadima> a good friend of mine is in chicago and visiting where we went to school and i'm pretty jealous
[05:20:07] <dimadima> yeah i'm good at forgetting shitty things. too good sometimes :/
[05:20:22] <indigo> Heheh
[05:21:07] <dimadima> i'm glad i finally tried figma. wish i had tried it earlier. it seem sto be how people make all that token app materiel
[05:21:49] <indigo> They should have called it фигня :D
[05:22:02] <dimadima> it would have been huge in russia hehe
[05:22:38] <dimadima> your work in ad tech?
[05:23:47] <indigo> Yes
[05:24:27] <dimadima> you*
[05:24:33] <dimadima> how is that
[05:24:59] <indigo> It's ok. Pays well, but not anything to write home about :)
[05:27:52] <dimadima> yeah the whole grass is always greener thing is fun. i miss pulling a nice salary very much. if my project fails i'll enjoy getting back to that very much. at least for a little bit :)
[05:28:01] <dimadima> then chances are i'll hate whatever
[05:28:18] <dimadima> :)
[05:28:49] <indigo> I read somewhere that the best job is not working on something you like the most, but working on something you hate the least :P
[05:29:20] <dimadima> that sounds right to me. and if possible, working with people you like
[05:29:57] <indigo> Yes, definitely. I do like my team at work
[05:30:12] <dimadima> that is geat.
[05:30:49] <dimadima> what languages/platforms do you work with
[05:33:44] <indigo> C++, Go, Java mostly. A little bit of Python here and there
[05:37:35] <dimadima> fun
[05:38:04] <dimadima> my backend was in java for a while but then i switched the whole stack to typescript and so i just live in vscode all day
[05:38:14] <dimadima> can't complain. it's pretty enjoyable
[05:38:21] <indigo> VSCode is nice!
[05:40:17] <dimadima> it's pretty nice. i feel bad for jetbrains
[05:40:32] <dimadima> they're being microsofted
[05:40:39] <indigo> Eh, Jetbrains still has their customers, especially for Java
[05:40:51] <indigo> If anything this is good for competition
[05:41:10] <dimadima> that's true. i have android studio open right now i guess
[05:41:18] <dimadima> what do you use vscode for?
[05:41:26] <dimadima> go? python?
[05:41:37] <indigo> Pretty much everything haha
[05:41:46] <dimadima> realllly? even java?
[05:41:57] <indigo> I don't have to touch much Java tbh
[05:42:39] <dimadima> i want to try vscode for langs other than typescript. people on HN say it sucks but i wonder
[05:42:55] <companion_cube> seems like jetbrains doesn't want to do a LSP server for kotlin
[05:42:58] <companion_cube> which is a pity
[05:43:46] <indigo> I'm sure someone will make it
[05:44:08] <companion_cube> it's a shitton of work, for a language where 99% of people probably use intellij :)
[05:44:23] <companion_cube> (otoh I think scala now has a decent LSP? metals?)
[05:44:38] <indigo> Right
[05:45:26] <indigo> Anyway, gotta head out. Have a good one folks!
[05:45:39] <dimadima> later indigo !
[05:46:01] <companion_cube> good night and all that

[16:00:44] <river> > George W. Bush approval rating polled at 90% by Gallup, the highest presidential approval rating ever recorded in US history (September 24th, 2001)
[16:00:46] <river> incredible
[16:04:04] <Brekkjern> Yeah, it's common that leaders poll better during crisis
[16:04:17] <Brekkjern> But 90% is AFAIK exceptionally high
[16:12:03] <river> i think people must have memory loss :P
[16:12:37] <Brekkjern> In what way?
[16:16:44] <river> cause bush sucked
[16:17:01] <Brekkjern> Well, yes
[16:17:01] *** Quits: bontaq (~user@ool-45779fe5.dyn.optonline.net) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[16:17:07] <river> in my wrong opinion
[16:17:54] <gwozniak> He did suck, but that was overlooked in Sep. 2001
[16:18:21] <gwozniak> He had only been president for 8 months at that point
[16:19:10] <kline> i wonder if america would pull together to the point of 90% approval in a point-in-time crisis today
[16:19:55] <Brekkjern> Depends on what race the president is...
[16:20:22] <river> very much doubt it kline !
[16:20:49] <kline> Brekkjern, pretty sure biden in white
[16:20:58] <river> I'm confused about this, what did he do that was so great in response to 9/11?
[16:21:11] <Brekkjern> kline: I was answering the general, not the specific question :P
[16:21:11] <river> i suppose 'not cause a nuclear war' is actually pretty good
[16:22:14] <kline> river, i dont think that his approval was reflective of anything other than the US pulling together against the baddie outsiders
[16:22:33] <river> what a great success that was
[16:23:20] <kline> he wasnt a good pres, but america was less interested in domestic shitshows, so i supposed people said he was doing a good job given the situation, rather than seeing it as an opportunity for domestic tribal battles
[16:26:13] <companion_cube> there's no crisis that can unite the US now
[16:26:19] <companion_cube> it'll always be labelled fake news
[16:26:43] <river> we need to ban regular people from the internet
[16:26:55] <river> it pretty clear that it's a psychohazard
[16:34:08] <gwozniak> river: the point was it almost didn't matter what his response was to 9/11. As long as he didn't seem sympathetic to the people who planned and carried out the attack, whoever was president was going to get a high approval rating
[16:34:31] <gwozniak> It's a mistake to think of these things in terms of rational responses
[16:34:41] <river> that is a very low bar
[16:34:52] <gwozniak> (responses to specific actions, that is)
[16:34:54] <companion_cube> well, trump managed to fuck it up anyway
[16:34:57] <companion_cube> it's amazing
[16:35:08] <gwozniak> Everything immediately after 9/11 was pure emotion
[16:42:36] <gwozniak> At that point, it was all about coming together after a tragedy
[16:43:04] <gwozniak> The terrible stuff of the Bush presidency happened after 9/11
[16:43:44] <companion_cube> fun stuff is, covid has been killing more people every day than 9/11, for a while
[16:43:52] <companion_cube> (not currently, but last winter)
[16:44:35] <gwozniak> Yup
[16:45:09] <gwozniak> Which means it doesn't matter how many people die, but how and when they die
[16:46:52] <companion_cube> also you can't go to war with covid
[16:47:30] <gwozniak> Also that
[16:47:53] <gwozniak> Covid is not an attack on freedoms. But public health policy is.
[16:47:59] <companion_cube> you can't fantasy roleplay shooting at brown people
[16:49:48] <river> I could be wrong but i feel like 9/11 has changed the world and society far more than covid will, in the long run
[16:49:54] <prussian> river: this numbering system is hilarious

[16:51:13] <prussian> oh jesus.
[17:01:26] <prussian> the future is now.
[17:11:42] <dimadima> and now
[17:20:54] <prussian> and........... soon
[17:22:28] <ngoldbaum> sweet got most of my security deposit back
[17:22:43] <ngoldbaum> always nice when landlords don’t try to pull shenanigans
[17:23:20] <gwozniak> handy, that
[17:26:17] <dimadima> that's always quite anxiety-inducing
[17:26:33] <dimadima> i wonder why, when the deposit the same as rent, people don't just not pay the last month
[17:26:36] <prussian> the power-dynamic is always a pita
[17:26:42] <gwozniak> That's how it works here
[17:27:01] <dimadima> i mean, that's generally a _bad_ thing to do, but it also seems like it lets landlords fuck you, which is bad too
[17:27:06] <prussian> I've had a place try throwing a whole year's rent on me even though my lease was up and never renewed (and moved out as well)
[17:27:13] <gwozniak> When I have given my 60 days notice in the past, my security deposit pays the last month
[17:27:28] <prussian> ended up back and forth with one of those dumb property management people for about a week
[17:27:28] <dimadima> gwozniak: do they inspect the place like 30 days before you leave or something?
[17:27:34] <dimadima> gwozniak: that's how it should work
[17:27:35] <ngoldbaum> dimadima: because the deposit is supposed to cover damages to the property
[17:27:52] <dimadima> ngoldbaum: right but it also lets a bad landlord fuck you
[17:27:59] <dimadima> and then your ownly recourse is small claims court
[17:27:59] <gwozniak> I've never had anyone do an inspection that I can recall
[17:28:04] <ngoldbaum> yeah well that’s on the law
[17:28:06] <dimadima> only*
[17:28:13] <prussian> What I don't get is: why not force renter insurance then.
[17:28:14] <dimadima> that sucks
[17:28:16] <prussian> there
[17:28:18] <ngoldbaum> so far haven’t needed to take anyone to small claims court
[17:28:25] <prussian> security deposits redundant then.
[17:28:34] <dimadima> me neither. i'm just saying, you never know, and that creates a lot of anxiety in me
[17:28:41] <gwozniak> I've rented for the last 30 years and never had a problem
[17:28:49] <ngoldbaum> also in many jurisdictions if a landlord tried to pull shenanigans and you can prove it in court the court will award the tenant treble damages
[17:28:58] <ngoldbaum> does take persistence and effort to get there though

[17:45:08] <dimadima> i'm looking at that user's list of projects and many of them look like they should be re-written in rust
[17:45:19] <prussian> so true.

[17:45:43] <Geekingfrog> it ascended to the meme status
[17:46:08] <prussian> speaking of terminals. I got a question today on how to set a serial port up and I'm suspecting the software they use is doing something independent of what they set it with sttty.
[17:46:08] <dimadima> particularly this https://github.com/andrewchambers/c
[17:46:09] <buttsbot> GitHub - andrewchambers/c: small self hosting C compiler
[17:46:37] <prussian> small self hosting C compiler, in rust.
[17:46:38] <prussian> make it so
[17:46:52] <river> that's a logical impossibility :P
[17:47:01] <river> unless it's both a rust and c compiler?
[17:47:10] <river> which is a cool idea actually
[17:49:11] <wrl> ngoldbaum: haha oh my *god*
[17:49:14] <wrl> this is incredible
[17:49:24] <gwozniak> That's basically what GCC is, if you compile it for multiple languages (it doesn't support Rust yet, mind you)
[17:50:07] <prussian> river: whoa...
[17:50:11] <prussian> fund it
[17:50:41] <ngoldbaum> g++ translates C++ to the equivalent C?
[17:50:51] <ngoldbaum> i know that’s what gfortran originally did
[17:50:56] <prussian> https://github.com/oriansj/stage0
[17:50:57] <buttsbot> GitHub - oriansj/stage0: A set of minimal dependency bootstrap binaries
[17:50:58] <prussian> there you go
[17:55:23] <kline> river | that's a logical impossibility :P
[17:55:25] <kline> co-self hosting
[17:55:41] <kline> a C compiler in rust that can compile enough of rustc to compile the C compiler source
[17:56:38] <gwozniak> ngoldbaum: Essentially what happens is that the driver chooses the correct backend binary to run to compile things.  You can compile C++ with the C driver by passing -x c++, for example.  However, when you do that you might get some weird linking problems
[17:57:53] <gwozniak> GCC is _roughly_ an front end to multiple languages, but not totally
[18:04:12] <gwozniak> All the complicated linking and arch options are determined with the specs (gcc -dumpspecs), and are contingent on a bunch of different things
[18:04:48] <ngoldbaum> so, “it’s
[18:04:52] <ngoldbaum> complicated”
[18:04:59] <ngoldbaum> perhaps unsurprisingly
[18:05:42] <dimadima> manicennui: wow that timber frame
[18:10:42] <gwozniak> ngoldbaum: yes. It's pretty messy. Spec files are nearly unreadable.  Just check out the *link_command section of -dumpspecs (usually the last one)
[18:11:19] <ngoldbaum> does llvm IR existing make all this less terrible for clang?
[18:11:44] <gwozniak> Clang does all this in C++ as command options, as I recall
[18:12:24] <gwozniak> Clang is different in that it's one binary that supports multiple targets.  GCC uses a different toolchain for each target.
[18:13:13] <gwozniak> Unless things have changed, the front-end for Clang will only support C/C++
[18:13:59] <gwozniak> The "real" compilers are the cc1 and cc1plus binaries for GCC.  gcc itself is a wrapper
[18:15:10] <gwozniak> I don't know what the Fortran and other compilers are called
[18:15:31] <gerikson> eldrich horrors from beyond the ken of mortal man
[18:15:31] <gwozniak> gcc -print-prog-name=cc1, if anyone is interested
[18:16:10] <gwozniak> And if you want to spend a day wasting your time, try to learn how to call the compiler directly
[18:17:44] <gerikson> I can call compilers from the vasty deep / why so can I, and so can any man / but will they compile when you call for them?
[18:18:26] <gwozniak> Not unless you set up some environment variables!

[18:40:00] <companion_cube> swag
[18:40:02] <gwozniak> I move my feet around way too much to use them
[18:40:12] <skyl4rk> can't shift around in your seat as much and still have a effective hmi connection
[18:40:32] <prussian> My understanding is the foot engages and disengages slower than your fingers.
[18:40:44] <prussian> never tried it, but that's what I heard from some other emacs zealot
[18:40:45] <companion_cube> so it's perfect for ctrl-meta
[18:41:04] <prussian> ya, perhaps.
[18:41:21] <prussian> the adv2 comes with an optional footpedal set. maybe I'll buy them

[21:16:31] <manicennui> But I was probably going to find a new job next year regardless.
[21:16:59] <dimadima> given that covid won't get better over the winter, "next year" probably at least mean spring/summer 2022
[21:17:24] <klardotsh> I am so glad to be starting a gig next week that took COVID as an excuse to permanently disband the concept of an office (their staff was already distributed anyway, so they just unblessed the "hub" office)
[21:17:37] <klardotsh> like I do not envy the folks who have to wonder when they're getting forced back in
[21:19:20] <klardotsh> and I guess further, for most roles, I don't see the point in the eagerness many managers have to going back in (other than the cynical guesses I could make)
[21:19:23] <manicennui> "the role does not involve the management or leadership of others"
[21:19:23] <indigo> COVID is getting better here in CA
[21:19:28] <gwozniak> `printenv SHELL` gives me tcsh.  WHAT HAVE I DONE TO DESERVE THIS
[21:19:30] <indigo> CA being california
[21:19:32] <manicennui> "the role does not require a significant degree of interaction with or influence upon others, particularly across teams or groups"
[21:19:37] <indigo> gwozniak: oh noooo
[21:19:39] <manicennui> My role involves both of those things...
[21:20:05] <gwozniak> indigo: Support issue that I have to use VNC to access.  Fun.
[21:20:16] <indigo> gwozniak: I hope they at least have bash installed
[21:20:30] <indigo> manicennui: Are you applying for something not-Rails, or sticking with it?
[21:20:51] <manicennui> Getting away from Rails and Ruby is the main reason I want a different job.
[21:21:00] <gwozniak> indigo: I can't change things much yet until I know more about what is going on, but yes, I would prefer to use something else
[21:21:17] <indigo> Right, better to use the user's environment when debugging
[21:21:59] <manicennui> Fortunately we have a direct competitor in Chicago that uses mainly Clojure (some Ruby too unfortunately), and there is another company in Chicago that does a different type of lending that uses Clojure.
[21:22:23] <manicennui> I don't think I'd have a problem getting a job at those companies, especially the first one.
[21:22:34] <indigo> No non-compete clause, eh?
[21:22:56] <manicennui> They aren't enforceable.
[21:23:05] <klardotsh> IIRC from my time in IL non-compete for anyone lower than senior management are basically lauaghed out of court
[21:23:09] <manicennui> My employer will just not allow me to give notice if I go to a competitor.
[21:23:14] <manicennui> People do it all the time.
[21:23:31] <manicennui> A non-compete in IL is basically not enforceable if there is no consideration.
[21:24:50] <klardotsh> which seems reasonable. the real thing a company wants to protect is its IP, so enforce the NDAs and banish the non-competes that just punish the workers
[21:25:00] <manicennui> Yeah, we have IP agreements.
[21:25:12] <manicennui> Frankly, I don't know why anyone would want the IP I work on.
[21:25:29] <manicennui> The only part of our business that is unique is our underwriting models.
[21:25:53] <manicennui> The rest of the software is basically what anyone would have to do to lend to our markets.
[21:26:18] <gwozniak> indigo: it's CentOS 7. I don't know what the default shell is there
[21:30:17] <indigo> gwozniak: It should be bash
[21:31:54] <indigo> Oh man, Cent and RHEL... 10 years from release to EoL
[21:32:24] <manicennui> Also happy to see that we are not only going to comply with the vaccination requirement for companies with more than 100 people, but the CEO specifically stated that we fully support it regardless of the government mandating it.
[21:33:32] <manicennui> Although they are working on figuring out how we will handle medical and religious exemptions. Fuck people whose religion involves putting others at risk for no reason.
[21:33:52] <prussian> does such a religion even exist?
[21:34:01] <companion_cube> also fuck religious tax exemption
[21:34:12] <gwozniak> indigo: then dear god they willingly chose tcsh
[21:34:21] <manicennui> prussian: Apparently some religious people are claiming it is due to the use of certain cell types.
[21:34:28] <bkero> At risk like not having access to birth control?
[21:34:31] <manicennui> Which were also used in the development of all kinds of common medications.
[21:34:46] <prussian> gwozniak: I remember one place where default user shell of csh. good luck
[21:34:49] <manicennui> gwozniak: Maybe my religion demands it!
[21:35:00] <prussian> EL7 with csh... damn
[21:35:22] <gwozniak> And less doesn't work. Reading these log files will be a joy
[21:35:42] <indigo> gwozniak: When I was younger (teenage) I also willingly chose tcsh. I chose it because the prompt looked "cooler" because it had a > instead of a $
[21:35:46] <prussian> manicennui: the immortalized cell lines of aborted babies? I thought most were just hamster ovaries. only the Janssen one I think is some baby that was aborted in '85, turned biologically immortal.
[21:35:51] <indigo> I didn't realize at the time that you could customize the bash prompt
[21:35:59] <prussian> but I don't remember
[21:36:00] <prussian> but ok
[21:36:03] <prussian> I guess that makes sense?
[21:36:05] <prussian> hmm
[21:36:10] <prussian> thanks for the honest answer at least.
[21:36:13] <indigo> gwozniak: What??? Try `more`?
[21:36:20] <manicennui> https://www.webmd.com/vaccines/covid-19-vaccine/news/20210918/some-medications-also-tied-to-religious-vaccine-exemption
[21:36:21] <buttsbot> Some Medications Also Tied to Religious Vaccine Exemption
[21:36:25] <gwozniak> indigo: more works, at least
[21:36:40] <prussian> rip
[21:36:48] <manicennui> "The majority of requests cited the use of fetal cell lines in the development of vaccines as part of the religious exemption. The practice uses cells grown in labs to test many new vaccines and drugs, including common antacids and cold medications."
[21:36:50] <companion_cube> after reading r/hca for a few weeks, I'm ok with people not vaccinating as long as they sign sth promising not to clog ICUs when they die of covid
[21:36:51] <prussian> lmao.
[21:36:56] <prussian> ya
[21:37:08] <manicennui> "A hospital system in Arkansas is requiring employees to confirm that they won’t use common medications — such as Tylenol, Tums, and Preparation H — to receive a religious exemption for the COVID-19 vaccine, according to Becker’s Hospital Review."
[21:37:08] <river> oh yeah i just found hca today
[21:37:15] <prussian> Immortalized cell lines, like little white lab mice, are pretty common.
[21:37:16] <companion_cube> (also they can't have the monoclonal treatment, it's full of aborted baby cells)
[21:37:16] <river> this is even darker than leopardsatemyface
[21:37:21] <indigo> I remember CentOS 7 having more creature comforts
[21:37:31] <bkero> b& from reddit?
[21:37:43] <manicennui> I don't think religious beliefs should ever allow health exemptions.
[21:37:49] <prussian> CentOS 7 was like going from the stone age to the future.
[21:37:49] <manicennui> s/allow/justify/
[21:37:52] <gwozniak> indigo: I have to be mindful of the current environment before I start changing anything. I'm basically in someone else's session
[21:38:00] <manicennui> Or most other exemptions really.
[21:38:02] <prussian> God I loved when EL7/CentOS7 came out
[21:38:20] <prussian> fuck pre-systemd.
[21:38:23] <prussian> sorry not sorry.
[21:38:30] <gwozniak> lol
[21:38:38] <indigo> Yeah systemd is nice
[21:39:08] <manicennui> systemd leads right to satan!
[21:39:28] <prussian> I think UNIXY ways already solidified my spot in hell
[21:39:55] <prussian> I will continue to sacrifice my children processes to moloch (malloc)
[21:40:55] <prussian> manicennui: honestly? I don't think religion should be an excuse for, well, lots of things
[21:40:59] <prussian> but here we are I guess.
[21:41:05] <prussian> hard to reconcile
[21:41:27] <prussian> I imagine the religious cop out is mostly just to skirt any potential supreme court insanity
[21:41:28] <dimadima> after first using systemd for a while i sent lennart a thank you message and told him to ignore the haters
[21:41:46] <prussian> People literally could not use sysvinits
[21:41:57] <companion_cube> prussian: systemd is good
[21:42:00] <prussian> the amount of cleanup I did, as my first real job, was nuts.
[21:42:02] <prussian> yes
[21:42:03] <companion_cube> needs rewrite in rust though, obviously
[21:42:19] <prussian> systemd meant most everyone could at least make a real service that just ran on linux
[21:42:43] <dimadima> i read that in israel 6/7 unvaccinated hospitalized people are also turning down antibodies
[21:43:09] <ngoldbaum> in the US antibodies are ok because daddy trump got them
[21:43:13] <dimadima> https://www.timesofisrael.com/initial-signs-that-unvaccinated-also-refusing-lifesaving-antibody-treatment/
[21:43:13] <buttsbot> Unvaccinated are also refusing lifesaving antibody treatment - initial reports | The Times of Israel
[21:43:15] <prussian> I've seen shit where people would use a cron user tab with 1 minute trigger used as their service init + monitoring
[21:43:18] <indigo> dimadima: Did he respond?
[21:43:21] <dimadima> ngoldbaum: do they even know that
[21:43:25] <dimadima> indigo: he did, i believe
[21:43:32] <indigo> Nice :D
[21:43:42] <ngoldbaum> yeah it was all over the news last year, trump also likes praising regeneron
[21:43:42] <prussian> ngoldbaum: b-but what if the antibodies were made with immortalized cell lines from aborted babies or cancers?
[21:43:49] <dimadima> systemd was such a breath of fresh air after buggy init scripts
[21:43:55] <ngoldbaum> prussian: doesn’t matter trump made it ok
[21:43:57] <prussian> o
[21:43:58] <prussian> but
[21:44:07] <prussian> then I hope they didn't claim religious exemption.
[21:44:12] <ngoldbaum> also the antibodies are approved under the same EUA as the vaccine
[21:44:15] <prussian> because that would be mighty strange.
[21:44:26] <dimadima> heh he wrote "Thank you very much for the kind words! Much appreciated!
[21:44:26] <ngoldbaum> but the vaccine is experimental and the antibodies are great
[21:44:34] <indigo> Awww that's sweet
[21:45:03] <manicennui> dimadima: I'm glad they are refusing treatments, as long as it is for themselves and not for any children who don't know better.
[21:45:19] <prussian> b-but
[21:45:23] <prussian> o-oh ok
[21:45:24] <indigo> I can't believe that folks sent him death threats for systemd
[21:45:30] <prussian> I can
[21:45:35] <manicennui> prussian: Treatments, not the vaccine.
[21:45:40] <prussian> I've seen all sorts of irrational hate for like everything indigo
[21:45:58] <manicennui> prussian: Although I could see an argument for them endangering medical staff by being sick longer.
[21:46:00] <prussian> some people are nuts
[21:46:03] <prussian> manicennui: ya but....
[21:46:04] <prussian> AAAAAAAAA
[21:46:09] <manicennui> I'm fine with digging a pit and just throwing those people in.
[21:46:15] <prussian> just get the fucking vaxx jesus I hate these people.
[21:46:20] <prussian> holy fuck
[21:46:25] <dimadima> manicennui: but 99% recover, dontcha know
[21:46:25] <prussian> I hate this corona shit
[21:46:38] <river> it'll be over soon
[21:46:52] <manicennui> Will it?
[21:47:11] <ngoldbaum> but vaccines cause autism by inducing a permanent magnetization on your forehead
[21:47:23] <companion_cube> when the magaists have all gotten covid 5 times adn died, yes
[21:48:11] <manicennui> Hospitals should just have them sign an agreement when they show up: allow us to use current medical treatments or go home and die.
[21:48:23] <prussian> I thought it was funny when some boomer told me he was proud he got the Janssen vaccine because he said it was like traditional ones, then I told him he got some nextgen genetically modified adenovirus injected in him.
[21:48:39] <prussian> maybe I should have kept it secret.
[21:48:54] <companion_cube> :DD
[21:50:23] <ngoldbaum> prussian: could always wait for the russian vaccine which includes *replicating adenovirus*
[21:50:57] <ngoldbaum> there’s a crazy in ##cycling who wanted to hold out for the russian vaccine for confusing reasons
[21:51:05] <prussian> whoa...
[21:51:17] <prussian> the Sputnik V one didn't silence the replication genes?
[21:51:26] <prussian> I wonder if it works better
[21:51:40] <prussian> ngoldbaum: I know someone like that too, but he is also learning russian for some reason... hmm
[21:52:18] <wrl> prussian: sorta, it was like... sputnik V is a viral vector, right? but in some of the doses that another country received (iirc it was brazil), the viral vector itself was replication-competent
[21:52:19] <ngoldbaum> prussian: there’s a whole controversy where the version of the vaccine used in the lancet paper on it is completely different from
[21:52:27] <ngoldbaum> what was actually shipped out
[21:52:45] <ngoldbaum> the brazilians found that the shipments they received included replicating virus
[21:52:49] <wrl> yeah
[21:52:55] <ngoldbaum> which was the main reason they didn’t approve it
[21:53:00] <wrl> but it was like Ad26 iirc
[21:53:04] <prussian> lol wtf
[21:53:10] <prussian> epic...
[21:53:16] <prussian> ya sign me up
[21:53:42] <manicennui> I'll never understand how the same group of people probably acted like Russia was the worst thing every a decade ago, and now seem to love it since Trump has a boner for them.
[21:53:48] <ngoldbaum> the russians thought covid was no biggie and there’d be easy IR wins
[21:53:58] <ngoldbaum> turned out whoopsy nope
[21:54:10] <manicennui> s/every/ever/
[21:54:14] <prussian> nothing about Russia sounds appealing.
[21:54:16] <prussian> at all
[21:54:25] <manicennui> prussian: Their literature?
[21:54:33] <prussian> I guess.
[21:54:51] <manicennui> The cool things they do for my entertainment on reddit?

[21:57:51] <manicennui> I also find their culture around competitive activities to be interesting, like chess and powerlifting.
[21:58:52] <manicennui> Russians I have worked with always seem to be interesting people.
[21:59:11] <manicennui> Plus their tea culture is cool.

[22:00:31] <prussian> I guess I'm missing out.
[22:00:43] <prussian> interesting way to drink tea.
[22:00:44] <Brekkjern> чаи
[22:00:44] <manicennui> prussian: I'm sure day-to-day life sucks.
[22:00:53] <Brekkjern> That's all I know about russian tea :P
[22:01:40] <manicennui> There is a restaurant in Chicago called Russian Tea Time that has cups like that.
[22:01:46] <manicennui> And really great black currant tea.
[22:02:00] <manicennui> As a Jew, a lot of their food is very familiar.
[22:02:20] <prussian> interesting.
[22:02:24] <manicennui> Pickled herring, liver, etc.
[22:02:36] <manicennui> Probably because American Jewish food is really just Eastern European food.
[22:03:10] <mouseghost> yeah lol no wonder
[22:03:19] <ngoldbaum> plenty of russian jews came
[22:03:26] <ngoldbaum> to the US and israel too
[22:03:28] <mouseghost> and brought the food with them
[22:09:46] <manicennui> Say what you will about the Russians, but they have things like this: https://www.russianrail.com/train/red-arrow
[22:09:47] <buttsbot> Red Arrow train, Buy Red Arrow train tickets online quickly and easily.
[22:09:58] <manicennui> " The train runs daily and has a maximum speed of 160 km/h without any stops. Travel time between St. Petersburg and Moscow is 8 hours."
[22:10:17] <manicennui> Do we have a single train in the US that does 100 MPH?
[22:10:30] <manicennui> Maybe one of the ones along the East Coast.
[22:11:03] <ngoldbaum> acela top speed is 150 mph, although it goes a lot slower than that for most of the trip
[22:13:20] <manicennui> They keep throwing money at a "high speed" train between Chicago and St. Louis. I believe high speed in this case means 75 MPH.
[22:13:26] <manicennui> They have spent billions on small sections of it.
[22:14:35] <manicennui> It would be nice to have 100MPH+ service between most major cities in the US.
[22:15:00] <manicennui> The real reason we can't do it is because someone has to make a fuckton of money off of it.
[22:15:14] <manicennui> So constructing rails costs a fortune in the US.

[22:33:16] <prussian> I just impulse bought 800g of Indian tea and I have no clue what I bought.
[22:33:39] <mouseghost> prussian, better than 800kg
[22:33:52] <prussian> maybe.
[22:34:04] <prussian> I already have like a kilo of chinese tea I have to drink first.
[22:36:24] <bkero> tea from India?
[22:36:32] <bkero> there's a lot of tea grown in India
[22:38:40] <gerikson> go trad and pay for it with opium
[22:39:43] <gerikson> ``The word "meconium" (derived from the Greek for "opium-like", but now used to refer to newborn stools) historically referred to related, weaker preparations made from other parts of the opium poppy or different species of poppies.''
[22:39:48] <gerikson> ...
[22:39:59] <companion_cube> :D
[22:40:04] <companion_cube> I wouldn't drink meconium
[22:52:04] <prussian> bkero: yes, I don't know anything about assam or darjeeling tea.
[22:52:09] <prussian> or any of it
[22:53:36] <bkero> You can always learn :)
[23:06:25] <manicennui> prussian: Throw tea parties.

[23:07:31] <manicennui> Menu ideas.
[23:07:55] <manicennui> I think Indians have something similar.
[23:07:56] <manicennui> Chat?
[23:08:07] <manicennui> Chaat
[23:08:20] <prussian> wouldn't know
[23:08:25] <manicennui> Not exactly the same thing.
[23:08:29] <prussian> we'll see if it's any good. I prefer black teas anyhow.

[23:08:53] <prussian> looks interesting.
[23:09:07] <manicennui> I'd love to have a bunch of fancy tea places all over.
[23:09:17] <manicennui> Clubs even.
[23:09:21] <prussian> I don't think there are any near me.
[23:09:39] <prussian> vaguely remember looking and then just saying fuck it, bought a bunch of tea from china.
[23:09:56] <prussian> I think I like tea more than coffee now.
[23:09:58] <manicennui> Some people at work have tea time, but it is just half a dozen people getting together in one of our smaller kitchens and drinking tea.
[23:10:12] <manicennui> I still love coffee.
[23:10:14] <prussian> do they say anything interesting though?
[23:10:27] <manicennui> There is nothing that beats a great cup of medium roast.
[23:10:45] <manicennui> prussian: Just generally chit chat that is common at work.
[23:11:05] <prussian> too bad the office is dead
[23:11:08] <prussian> wfh forever
[23:11:47] <manicennui> We had a return to office pilot and now our office is open for anyone who provides proof of vaccination and follows current mandates.
[23:11:52] <manicennui> There are people who go in.
[23:12:32] <prussian> lucky you. my work fears the mandate
[23:13:31] <manicennui> During the return to office pilot there were maybe a few dozen people in an office designed for a few hundred.
[23:13:36] <manicennui> It is kind of nice.
[23:13:44] <manicennui> I think there are even fewer now.
[23:18:33] <prussian> rip. someone at my work asked if we wanted to do an in person meeting, and I stayed silent
[23:19:42] <manicennui> We managed to have one of our catered events during the pilot, which was nice.
[23:20:01] <manicennui> My employer must be saving a ton from all of the perks they haven't provided for 18 months.
[23:20:24] <manicennui> But we're at the point now where they need to start increasing other benefits if they don't want people to leave.
[23:23:18] <manicennui> The end of summer hours was especially noticeable this year.
[23:23:34] <manicennui> I think extending them year round would be a good first step.
[23:28:17] <prussian> lol
[23:28:39] <prussian> I keep getting mixed messaging on that. I was under the impression at my dept was we had "summer hours forever"
[23:28:48] <prussian> but I still get emails from HR saying, summer hours are over.
[23:29:05] <prussian> but whatever. I just half ass it and leave whenever anyhow. or in this case, IRC whenever.
[23:29:14] <prussian> stop me work.
[23:32:22] <manicennui> Yeah, I think a lot of people where I work are not fully dedicated on Friday afternoons.
[23:32:40] <manicennui> If were were in the office a lot of people would be in the kitchen drinking beer after 4 anyways.
[23:32:59] <prussian> they don't even allow beer in the office.
[23:33:00] <prussian> wow
[23:33:09] <prussian> cool kids over there.
[23:33:37] <river> no beer in the office? why would anyone go in?
[23:33:53] <prussian> it's a mystery
[23:45:00] <manicennui> No beer in the office is kind of a faux pas if you want to attract top tech people in some markets.
[23:45:31] <bkero> The office is kind of a faux pas if you want to attract top tech people in some markets.
[23:45:39] <manicennui> Becoming that way.
[23:45:45] <manicennui> But how will tech people get free beer?
[23:45:53] <manicennui> And bad pizza?
[23:46:07] <companion_cube> WeWork stopped providing beer like two years ago
[23:46:14] <companion_cube> no one knows why
[23:49:21] <dimadima> they ran out
[23:57:27] <prussian> I miss the days where I could drink a good beer and not be sick
[23:57:29] <prussian> tragic
[23:58:50] <bkero> Are we all still allergic to gluten or baking sourdough at home?
[23:59:14] <prussian> no gluten. I think it is the crohn's
