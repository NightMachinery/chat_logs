[02:42:09] <junebug> I have a question about modulo. I know that modulo gives the remainder when dividing two numbers. 3 % 2 is 1 because 3 / 2 has a remainder of 1. But I don't understand why 5 % 10 is 5. Can someone explain?
[02:44:11] *** Joins: saged (uid510004@user/smi)
[02:44:49] <greenbagels> junebug: so division with remainder can be understood like this
[02:45:20] <greenbagels> actually before i give this explanation, are you comfortable with variables representing numbers
[02:45:31] <junebug> Yes
[02:46:28] <greenbagels> ok so a / b = q with remainder r means that a = b*q + r, where r is smaller than b
[02:46:47] <junebug> Ok
[02:46:49] *** Joins: AkechiShiro (~licht@user/akechishiro)

[02:47:40] <greenbagels> so with 5 % 10, you're basically asking for the remainder of 5 / 10; but 5 = 0 * 10 + 5; the zero cant be anything larger
[02:47:42] <junebug> So a = 10 * 0 + 5
[02:47:44] <greenbagels> right
[02:48:09] <greenbagels> this was probably a more technical explanation than it could have been
[02:48:12] <greenbagels> but its one way to look at it

[02:48:26] <Hash> modulo is not the remainder
[02:48:35] <Hash> modulo is the number you divide by to get the remainder
[02:48:39] <junebug> Right I get that part but why. 5 fits into 10. Maybe I'm not thinking of it correctly
[02:48:41] <Hash> it's goofy english
[02:48:53] <river> no, modulo is actually the remainder
[02:48:55] <Hash> a % b = r
[02:49:03] <Hash> % is the operator, not the remainder
[02:49:08] <junebug> Hash, right
[02:49:11] <river> the quotient is the number you get from dividing
[02:49:25] <greenbagels> the modulo is the operation, yes; like "12 modulo 5"
[02:49:32] <Hash> :)
[02:49:47] <Hash> Like I said, English is weird, espcially in math
[02:50:10] <ihate> i heard greenbagels likes english
[02:50:10] <Hash> You module something to another to get a remainder.
[02:50:12] <greenbagels> junebug: another way to think about it is you keep subtracting 10 from 5 until it is less than 10
[02:50:14] <greenbagels> ihate: lmao
[02:50:21] <Hash> so modulo is not the remainder itself. that's 'r'
[02:50:24] <junebug> I always read modulo as what is the remainder when we try to fit a into b
[02:50:36] <Hash> mod or % is the operation for the divisor/didident
[02:50:43] <Hash> divisor and dividen
[02:50:46] <Hash> divisor and dividend
[02:50:47] <Hash> blah.
[02:50:54] <greenbagels> junebug: its the remainder when you break a into chunks of b
[02:51:06] <greenbagels> 5 can't be broken down into chunks of 10; it's already smaller than 10
[02:51:11] <junebug> greenbagels, ok that makes sense
[02:51:14] <greenbagels> so it is its own remainder mod 10

[02:56:00] <greenbagels> oh sorry im thinking of 0^0
[02:56:09] <greenbagels> 0^0 is out of convenience, n^0 (for nonzero n) has more reason to it
[02:56:17] <ihate> convention?
[02:56:20] <bildramer> like "-2 = 13 mod 5" you could see as "(-2 = 13) mod 5" or "-2%5 = 13%5" usually, but the best way is "we're not talking about integers but the elements 0,1,2,3,4 of an object with addition and multiplication and so on defined as you'd expect
[02:56:23] <greenbagels> ihate: both
[02:56:32] <greenbagels> ihate: wait do you mean n^0 or 0^0 lol
[02:56:35] <ihate> I don't know what you mean by out of convenience
[02:56:58] <junebug> How can 0^0 = 1?
[02:57:05] <bildramer> sometimes a good question to ask is "what else could it be?" for n^0
[02:57:14] <greenbagels> junebug: first think about n^0
[02:57:27] <greenbagels> to steal something out of ski's playbook, consider n^k / n^k

[03:01:33] <ihate> when something in math is not naturally defined, we impose a definition based on our needs.
[03:01:43] <junebug> bildramer, but why? How do we know when and how do we come to that conclusion
[03:01:48] <greenbagels> in this case, there are multiple competing *natural* choices
[03:01:59] <greenbagels> using the limit arguments that bildramer points out
[03:02:26] <ihate> (all othe cases = other than 0^0)
[03:02:31] <junebug> Ok
[03:02:36] <bildramer> it's often that we have such problems. consider 1/x
[03:02:47] <junebug> When you say natural what do you mean greenbagels ?
[03:03:30] <bildramer> 1/2 then 1/1 then 1/0.5 it keeps increasing, so maybe 1/0 is infinite, but also 1/(-2) then 1/(-1) then 1/(-0.5) keeps decreasing, so it's negative infinity?
[03:03:41] <greenbagels> junebug: think about bildramer's comment; 0^n is 0 for all n>0; n^0 is 1 for all n != 0
[03:04:03] <ihate> e.g., the squareroot of a perfect square makes sense. We naturally extend to none perfect squares: sqrt(x) is the number y such that y^2 = x. (say x>0)
[03:04:11] <bildramer> what you do is usually notice that things don't add up, and ask yourself "what is the real question, instead of "the value of 1/x at x=0"?"
[03:04:40] <junebug> So it's a limit. Undefined at the exact value of 0
[03:05:22] <greenbagels> well im just giving an argument using limits (maybe more about consistency than limits)
[03:05:51] <greenbagels> but i also agree with the comment that if an argument arises about the notation there's probably a different underlying problem that doesn't rely on the notation

[03:08:02] <bildramer> both, really. we start from few assumptions and discover a lot of things we couldn't have figured out on our own before, and this process also explains observations very well
[03:08:12] <junebug> What is the general opinion today on that question greenbagels ?
[03:08:39] <bildramer> plus, in cases like this, you can just patch any "holes" like that - you define functions as having a domain and range, for example, then not only does everything work again, but also you discover new stuff

[03:09:16] <junebug> bildramer, but are we discovering those things because they are part of reality or are they logical conclusions we can draw if the statement we made is true.
[03:09:20] <bildramer> or you say "I'll stick to "nice" objects without these defects" and you discover that they're pleasant to work with
[03:09:38] <bildramer> those aren't mutually exclusive
[03:10:34] <bildramer> in reality you won't really find division-by-zero errors, of course, and because of physics everything is indeed smooth and nice almost always, but it could have been otherwise
[03:11:05] <junebug> Interesting
[03:11:49] <junebug> I've seen proofs on 1 + 1 = 2 and boolean logic but don't they all start with some assumption? If a is true then boolean logic works and if b is true then 1 + 1 = 2.
[03:11:56] <ihate> arguably, most things are not smooth

[03:12:31] <ihate> junebug math always starts with a set of axioms, yes
[03:12:40] <bildramer> another thing is that there's surprising consistency everywhere. e.g. if you assume some particles are exactly points, some value will be A, and if you assume they have some extent, you'll take a completely different path towards calculating the value, but it will still be "A + small bit that depends on something and in the real world is almost always near 0"
[03:13:05] <ihate> same with doing physics, in fact
[03:13:07] <bildramer> models match reality because the assumptions match reality, more or less
[03:13:36] <greenbagels> well in physics all the "axioms" are falsifiable

[03:15:36] <greenbagels> and what ought to be true depends on what you think is reasonable, it doesnt have to be based on any "real" or physical arguments
[03:16:07] <ihate> physics is built on axioms which we believe to be true based on experiment. By definition, they are not falsifiable.
[03:16:12] <junebug> I'm definitely interested in the study of these assumptions. There's fundamental assumptions that most people hold about reality that I don't agree with so I'd like to look more into fundamental mathematical assumptions or axioms. Where can I learn more?
[03:16:15] <bildramer> relativity is a good test case: most speeds in everyday life are very slow, so we can use newtonian mechanics as an approximation instead. if you dig a bit, you'll find that those theories are completely contradictory, but one works perfectly well for most engineering
[03:16:21] <greenbagels> > we believe to be true based on experiment.
[03:16:27] <greenbagels> this is *exactly* the definition of falsifiable
[03:16:38] <river> not exactly
[03:16:44] <PlanckWalk> Thought I was in ##physics for a bit
[03:16:57] <ihate> no it's not
[03:17:02] <river> falsifiable means we can create an experiment that may or may not disprove it
[03:17:33] <bildramer> "we could believe to be false based on more experiments" - except not really, you'd have to do some real magic to convince me we missed something big about electromagnetism
[03:18:27] <greenbagels> bildramer: that's exactly what quantum mechanics did, though
[03:18:39] <river> ive been learning about spin recently..
[03:18:41] <bildramer> hypothetically, we could be wrong about EM, but also we could be wrong and I'm having a stroke and every algebraic equation I've ever written happens to be wrong but I happen to be remembering it as consistent and correct
[03:18:42] <river> its crazy
[03:18:44] <PlanckWalk> Depends which "we" you're talking about.
[03:18:59] <bildramer> it's that kind of level of implausibility, unlike, say, the actual details of how neutrinos work
[03:19:15] <ihate> also depends on what you mean by "being wrong"
[03:19:19] <river> I really want to learn proper classical EM actually
[03:19:20] <bildramer> yeah
[03:19:26] <PlanckWalk> EM theory is probably at least as accurate as Newtonian physics
[03:19:26] <river> i should grab griffiths
[03:19:29] <ihate> newtonian mechanics is wrong?
[03:19:37] <bildramer> almost certainly the result would be "EM is right but there was this strange fluke where someone convinced me otherwise in 2022, weird"

[03:19:52] <junebug> Falsiablility has one important aspect though. The assumption of the basis of the experiment has to be correct. Otherwise one can come to conclusion that something is not falsifiable. I'll give an example. This is not math so let me know if I'm off topic: we can never separate a color from a shape. Any thing that has a color also has a shape. So if one were to posit the question as to whether a color or a shape are two separate
[03:19:52] <junebug> entities one could fall into the wrong assumption that such an experiment is unfalsifiable.

[03:20:02] <river> oops
[03:20:04] <river> i just meant to paste one line of that
[03:20:06] <river> but yeah nvm :|
[03:20:28] <bildramer> the earth is not a sphere, it's close to a sphere. but "close to a sphere" is correct enough that you can derive many correct things from it
[03:20:49] <river> earth is actually a flat disc...
[03:20:57] <mycroftiv> falsifiability can never be the whole story for fundamental theories because our ability to -know what is falsifiable- depends on our theory of -what is knowable and how- and that is itself part our scientific knowledge
[03:20:59] <ihate> conformally the same
[03:21:01] <river> paradigm shift
[03:21:20] <bildramer> in fact when someone says "not a sphere" we don't even think that's always correct, because language doesn't work like that - he could mean "your GPS calculations are garbage, there's a whole field of study, ask a professional cartographer" or he could mean "I think it's flat"
[03:21:20] <junebug> thanks mycroftiv
[03:21:31] <ihate> mycroftiv exactly
[03:21:34] <bildramer> mycroftiv: everything is consilient though
[03:21:47] <bildramer> I already believe I exist, I can measure real things, logic works etc. no problem
[03:21:56] <bildramer> so I know what's falsifiable
[03:21:57] <mycroftiv> bildramer: absolutely, we are each as observers within some consistent model of some consistent theory
[03:22:13] <ihate> something something aboslutes
[03:22:13] <junebug> bildramer, but the belief that you exist is an assumption right?
[03:22:17] <bildramer> it's disturbing that some people genuinely don't, by the way
[03:22:24] <mycroftiv> but what model of what theory and our formal structure as observers seems to be inherently logically unknowable in perfect detail for several converging reasons
[03:22:32] <bildramer> it's like not knowing how a computer works at all, treating them like magic boxes, that must be horrifying
[03:22:49] <mycroftiv> however that is a feature rather than a bug, because it means we can forcing-choose what reality model we are computing
[03:22:51] <river> thats how computers are to me :/
[03:23:02] <river> except demon boxes not magic, because they never work
[03:23:09] <junebug> river, lol
[03:23:26] <bildramer> it's an assumption, but one of those assumptions like "tomorrow logic and physics will still work like today"
[03:23:31] <cloudcell> hello everyone! I have some trouble understanding how to choose a "convenient" value for the eigenvector as there are infinite solutions. Please see under "Step 4" here https://www.intmath.com/matrices-determinants/7-eigenvalues-eigenvectors.php
[03:23:36] <PlanckWalk> Yes, that's part of the model
[03:23:59] <PlanckWalk> If the model fails to match observations, we might need to change or discard it.
[03:24:06] <bildramer> river: at least broadly, you know what logic gates are, what a cpu and memory are, etc. right
[03:24:07] <bildramer> ?
[03:24:18] <bildramer> or that things are made of atoms
[03:24:18] <river> cloudcell: well they use 1 at first, because that makes things simple. later on they use 2, why?
[03:24:25] <PlanckWalk> cloudcell: usually a unit one
[03:24:31] <junebug> bildramer, I think it's a fundamentally wrong assumption. Experiences exist for sure. But they don't require a self for them to exist.
[03:24:32] <river> yeah i know that part
[03:24:33] <mycroftiv> see heres the other thing - each observer is literally inside a different light cone which means the universes of each are objectively different and only a finite subportion of information available to each can be exchanged
[03:24:42] <river> but actual computers run all this crap and auto-update etc.
[03:25:00] <PlanckWalk> But sometimes some other is more convenient for some purpose.
[03:25:20] <mycroftiv> so you have to apply communications and information theory to each communicators ability to build an accurate model of the other communicators world
[03:25:26] <cloudcell> PlanckWalk: so I should just choose 1  for the first variable and then solve for the remaining values and then normalize so that the length is 1 ?
[03:25:30] <PlanckWalk> E.g. integer components are often easy to work with
[03:25:32] <cloudcell> river: I have no idea :(
[03:25:52] <PlanckWalk> cloudcell: Up to you.  Whatever works best for your case.

[03:26:10] <cloudcell> thank you very much
[03:26:20] <greenbagels> cloudcell: if you have an eigenvector, say u; then any other vector v = c*u (for any constant c) is also a eigenvector

[03:31:36] <bildramer> let's not go into deep philosophy like "what is an agent?" - at that point, the agent-environment distinction is just part of your computations, and you know, I'd rather wait for us to figure out what sort of algorithm the brain runs, first
[03:31:47] <junebug> greenbagels, oh yeah that would be good
[03:32:03] <junebug> bildramer, fair enough
[03:32:04] <greenbagels> like naturally early math was very much focused on "physically-motivated" phenomena
[03:32:08] <bildramer> one thing I'd ask is "what's the point of questioning all assumptions?"
[03:32:24] <greenbagels> or axioms that were based in things that were physically intuitive and stuff
[03:32:30] <bildramer> the risk of being wrong? can't be that, nobody is actually acting as if the sun could blow up any day now
[03:32:40] <junebug> bildramer, I made an interesting discovery by questioning my assumptions.
[03:32:45] <greenbagels> (or, early enough, maybe not even axioms at all)
[03:32:52] <bildramer> needing to be 100% completely totally axiomatically right? well, that's impossible, it seems
[03:33:21] <junebug> Right. I don't think we can only be 100% about a few things

[03:35:24] <junebug> bildramer, Experiences of seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, feeling, and thinking. Not that the objects of experience are actually real but that the experience itself is happening when it happens.

[03:36:47] <bildramer> why so sure of that? signals are traveling in your brain for you to experience things at all, and clearly, those signals have a propagation delay
[03:37:04] <bildramer> and in principle, could be delayed much more, or replayed, or faked
[03:37:48] <bildramer> especially the senses. some of the point of optical illusions is that you can think you have experiences you didn't have

[03:48:49] <zacts> first, visually and conceptually, what does it mean to add two vectors together?
[03:49:02] <Jacques96> Go to Desmos
[03:49:07] <Jacques96> and add two vectors
[03:49:10] <Jacques96> then you'll see
[03:49:20] <greenbagels> So conceptually a vector is just any element of a vector space
[03:49:32] <zacts> ok
[03:49:35] <greenbagels> Which is some collection of vectors that obey some properties
[03:49:45] <greenbagels> One of these is that the sum of two vectors is in the space too
[03:50:24] <greenbagels> Now at first glance that is all you get from the definition
[03:50:42] <Jacques96> I'll have to hop off soon, plankwalk, so if you write something please pling me
[03:51:02] <greenbagels> When students are introduced to vectors for the first time, they typically aren't given this level of generality in the definition
[03:51:16] <greenbagels> They're given a picture of arrows in the 2D plane
[03:51:26] <zacts> ok
[03:51:29] <zacts> yeah
[03:52:09] <greenbagels> And are told "these are vectors; they have a length and a direction, or we can talk about their (x,y) coordinates"
[03:52:32] <zacts> yeah, that's how I'm kind of being introduced to it in my text
[03:52:57] <greenbagels> Ok, so in that case your book might say "to add vectors, add their respective coordinates"
[03:53:14] <greenbagels> (x1+x2, y1+y2)
[03:53:36] <zacts> yes
[03:54:54] <zacts> it seems to me that vectors in isolation are difficult to understand.
[03:54:54] <ww1986> If you would have an n-tuple, how would that differ from a vector practially?
[03:55:13] <zacts> but if you can see them within a system of vectors kind of it might make more sense to me.
[03:55:37] <zacts> because if I think of the addition of two vectors in isolation, I'm thinking cartesian points kind of
[03:55:49] <greenbagels> zacts: well, if you start from just the more abstract definition, you will eventually get to a point where all vector spaces of "finite dimension" (whatever that means) will look just like our familiar picture of arrows in the corresponding n-dimensional space
[03:56:17] <greenbagels> if you're taking a linear algebra course right now you will eventually get to the point of proving this

[04:05:36] <zacts> yeah, but I don't yet understand what linear combinations *are*. I watched some of the 3b1b videos to understand it. like, a linear combination is the addition of two scaled vectors, right?
[04:05:47] <ww1986> ihate what would be an example of such an abstract vector?
[04:06:09] <ihate> ww1986 do you know what a vector space is?
[04:06:33] <zacts> also, maybe I need something to tinker on to understand this too, like some problems or something.
[04:06:38] <ww1986> vaguely, basically it has to satisfy a set of vector space axioms, and vectors then would be elements of that vector space. Do you have an example of an abstract vector?
[04:06:40] <ihate> zacts it's just a weighted sum of objects
[04:07:13] <ihate> if x = av + bw, with v,w vectors, then x is "a-much" of v and "b-much" of w
[04:07:29] <zacts> oh
[04:07:39] <ihate> ww1986 an abstract vector is an element of a vector space
[04:07:47] <ihate> you don't get n-tuples until you choose a basis

[04:08:15] <zacts> ok, so one primary goal of linear algebra is to solve systems of equations.
[04:08:22] <zacts> how do linear combinations help you to achieve this goal?
[04:08:37] <ihate> zacts e.g., if v=(1,0) and w=(0,1), can you tell me how to write (2,3) in terms of v and w?
[04:09:13] <zacts> 2v+3w
[04:09:24] <ihate> that's a linear combination of v and w
[04:09:27] <zacts> which is a linear combination
[04:09:28] <zacts> ok
[04:09:32] <zacts> cool
[04:09:37] <ihate> (2,3) is 2 of v and 3 of w
[04:10:22] <zacts> I think if you could throw as many problems at me as possible that's how I learn stuff.
[04:10:39] <zacts> what's the next step after that?
[04:10:42] <ihate> your text should have exercises
[04:10:46] <ihate> next step in what sense?
[04:11:07] <zacts> next step in the type of math problem
[04:12:10] <ihate> idk what's considered as being directly *after* linear combinations.
[04:12:21] <zacts> let me look at my text
[04:13:17] <ihate> I guess, do you understand vector space bases?
[04:13:49] *** Joins: lakitu (~lakitu@192-198-3-9.dhcp.radiolinkinternet.com)
[04:14:00] <zacts> a basis is the set of coordinate unit vectors?
[04:14:12] <ihate> that's an example
[04:14:44] <ihate> here's a problem: let V denote the space of polynomials of degree at most 3. What is a natural basis?
[04:15:17] <zacts> R³
[04:15:28] <ihate> that's not a basis nor is it V
[04:16:11] <zacts> what does natural mean in natural basis?
[04:16:24] <ihate> it's more like "what's the obvious basis"
[04:16:27] <ihate> nothing rigorous
[04:16:29] <zacts> ah ok
[04:16:39] <zacts> so the 'obvious' natural basis would be the x,y,z coordinates
[04:16:42] <ihate> e.g., the obvious basis for space of n-tuples (a,b) is (1,0),(0,1)
[04:16:44] <zacts> the unit vectors on those coordinates

[04:18:22] <zacts> ihate: ^ how's that?
[04:18:50] <ihate> that's an "obvious" basis for 3-tuples, sure
[04:20:00] <zacts> is the above not a natural basis for your question?
[04:20:22] <ihate> it is
[04:20:26] <ihate> "natural"

[07:21:35] <[itchyjunk]> why do i have a function of just t on LHS?
[07:21:40] <[itchyjunk]> or how, rather
[07:21:45] <ihate> you've integrated out the dependence on x
[07:21:57] *** Joins: djinni (~djinni@static.38.6.217.95.clients.your-server.de)
[07:22:02] <ihate> do you agree that the LHS only depends on t?
[07:22:18] <[itchyjunk]> hmm
[07:22:48] <[itchyjunk]> Is that how it works? since i integrate it wrt x, its no longer dependent on x?
[07:22:53] <ihate> if I have f(x,t) = xt and I integrate with repsect to x (e.g., int_0^1 f(x,t) dx), you'll get something only in terms of t, right?
[07:22:58] <[itchyjunk]> i guess that kinda makes sense but not sure i am fimiliar with that
[07:22:58] <ihate> yes
[07:23:09] <[itchyjunk]> oh right
[07:23:13] <ihate> let f(x,t) = xt. compute int_0^1 xt dx for me
[07:23:16] <[itchyjunk]> in your example, it makes sense
[07:23:28] <ihate> that's why the LHS only depends on t
[07:23:49] <[itchyjunk]> t[x^2] / 2
[07:23:53] <[itchyjunk]> so t/2
[07:23:55] <ihate> when you differentiate a function of a single variable, you typically just use the d/dt notation (as opposed to ∂/∂t)
[07:23:58] <ihate> yeah
[07:24:05] <[itchyjunk]> i see
[07:24:18] <ihate> on the RHS you are differentiating the function Psi(x,t), which is of two variables
[07:24:22] <ihate> whence ∂/∂t
[07:24:45] <[itchyjunk]> that makes sense. i wasn't thinking closely enough about what d/dt was differentiating vs the partial
[07:24:51] <[itchyjunk]> that was pretty straight forward
[07:24:59] <ihate> yeah, it's just a notational convention.

[07:34:53] <isekaijin> Well, this is the math channel, what's wrong with talking about math here?
[07:35:18] <ihate> tbf "stable homotopy groups" don't sounds *that* advanced
[07:35:47] <isekaijin> ^
[07:37:07] <[itchyjunk]> ive heard of fundamental groups
[07:37:18] <tusko> That's funny, when I see stuff like that my mind just defaults to stupefaction.
[07:37:36] <isekaijin> tusko: That's not too unlike my reaction, actually.
[07:37:54] <isekaijin> But the difference is that I need to eventually understand this stuff, or else I fail courses I have enrolled in.
[07:38:17] <tusko> You in a PhD program?
[07:38:23] <isekaijin> Not yet.
[07:38:27] <tusko> woah

[07:44:58] <isekaijin> Apparently, nested sequences of pointed spaces p \in X_0 \subset X_1 \subset X_2 \subset ... The key observation is that, for any fixed q >= 1, the sequence of q-th homotopy groups G_n = \pi_q(X_n, p) eventually stabilizes, i.e., for large n, G_n doesn't depend on n.
[07:45:14] <isekaijin> But of course the sequence of spaces X_n can't be totally arbitrary. What conditions does it have to satisfy? I don't know.

[19:46:47] <remii> The proof starts by construction of a new function f_D where f_D(x, y) = f(x, y) when (x, y) \in D and 0 when (x, y) not in D.
[19:46:48] <isekaijin> Seriously, I had good class notes for this stuff, but I forgot the mathb.in links.
[19:47:07] <isekaijin> I don't remember the proof of every theorem I'm ever shown.
[19:47:18] <remii> I'm just writing it out ;p
[19:47:24] <isekaijin> (Especially from real analysis, which I don't care too much about.)
[19:48:10] <remii> Then we wish to show that f_D is integrable over K, where D \subset K.
[19:48:57] <smlckz> what is K here?
[19:50:00] <remii> It's a set that covers D and is easier to integrate over, for example a rectangle.
[19:51:40] <remii> By the definition of a null set, the boundary of D can be covered by a countable union of intervals R of arbitrarily small total length.
[19:53:05] <remii> Then f_D is uniformly continuous and bounded on K \ R. We can construct step functions \Phi and \Psi on K \ R as we know from previous theorem(s). Now I don't get the following:
[19:53:06] <isekaijin> Okay, I found the key part of my notes, but sadly they aren't in English. We say that a subset S of R^n is J-measurable if (a) it's bounded, say, by a closed box A, (b) the characteristic function of S is integrable.

[19:53:43] <remii> "In R, let \Phi = m and \Psi = M where m is the lower bound of f_D and M is the upper bound of f_D".
[19:53:45] <isekaijin> And it turns out that a bounded subset of R^n is J-measurable if and only if its boundary is a null set.

[20:26:26] <river> right ok
[20:26:30] <river> so we know that a is one of the roots

[20:26:45] <river> and you will get a quadratic with the 2 remaining roots
[20:26:46] <cadmio> I've tested a^2 as well and it's a root

[20:27:50] <cadmio> since we've 8 elements, without doing divisions it's just a matter of testing the 2 elements left
[20:28:10] <Z-module> cadmio, remember that in rings of characteristic 2 like this, you can immediately replace any odd coefficient with 1, and any even with 0.

[22:26:33] <zacts> hi
[22:26:39] <zacts> I have a linear algebra inquiry
[22:27:06] <zacts> I'm trying to understand how to determine if the linear combination of two vectors is on a line or a plane.
[22:27:10] *** Joins: dez (uid92154@user/dez)
[22:27:21] <zacts> I guess I need to first determine if they are linearly dependent or not.
[22:27:36] <river> if u and v are two vectors, the set of all linear combinations is S = { a u + b v | a,b in R }
[22:27:41] *** Quits: magic_ninja (~sparkie1@2600:1700:3ab0:e9f0:978f:355e:b1a8:8e5b) (Remote host closed the connection)
[22:27:48] <river> this can be a line or a plane, depending on if u and v coincide or not
[22:28:05] <river> coincide being, u = s v for some s in R
[22:28:20] <zacts> ok
[22:28:22] <river> ah.. S can also be {0} if both vectors are 0
[22:28:41] <river> so this requires proof
[22:28:51] <river>  u = s v for some s in R  IFF  S is a line

[22:47:01] <zacts> I thought the starting point didn't matter?

[22:49:25] <river> you say equivalent, but what dio you mean?
[22:49:42] <river> earlier i defined coincide to mean u = s v for some s in R
[22:49:59] <zacts> there's no other way to represent (4, 5) in a fully simplified form. (4, 5) *is* the vector (4, 5)

[22:51:14] <zacts> I'm just confused I think because you can plot an equivalent vector beginning at the origin, or beginning somewhere else.
[22:52:02] <zacts> so I was wondering if (4, 5) is the only simplified way to represent that vector, or if there are other modified versions of (4, 5) notation that are equivalent to that.

[23:05:37] <zacts> huh
[23:06:46] <zacts> so, can I think of direct addition of vectors as being kind of like scaling an image via direct pixels, and linear combinations as scaling an image via % (if that makes any sense as an analogy).
[23:07:31] <zacts> like, linear combinations are the addition of scaled vectors
[23:07:51] <river> no addition of vectors is putting them top to tail
[23:07:59] <river> A->B + B->C  = A->C
[23:08:08] <zacts> ok
[23:08:16] <river> if the second vector doesn't start at B, you can move it so they are top to tail
[23:08:34] <zacts> oh, there's an odd case of that
