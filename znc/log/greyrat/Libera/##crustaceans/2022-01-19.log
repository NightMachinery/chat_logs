[00:00:54] <buttsbot> Adblocking Does Not Constitute Copyright Infringement, Court Rules * TorrentFreak
[00:04:28] <manicennui> The Court notes that ruling otherwise would represent a “disproportionate encroachment” on users’ freedoms to make various choices, including not to load images to save bandwidth, to deactivate Javascript, or block pop-ups or tracking elements. It would also render translation tools and aids for visually impaired people as copyright infringing.
[00:06:17] <imode> good.
[00:06:40] <imode> the fact that we had to have a ruling for that shows how far away we are.
[00:07:00] <manicennui> Yeah, but it's just Germany.
[00:07:36] <manicennui> This case will probably go on much longer if it is brought to the US.
[00:14:55] <kl1n3> friend is working at a uni and is commenting on how simple some of the programming exercises are
[00:15:23] <kl1n3> so i solved the core of the problem with 1 assembly instruction in agreement

[02:23:05] <imode> I don't think I have the time.
[02:25:05] <gerikson> you know what pisses me off most about HN? When someone posts a coment, a 2nd person replies, and a 3rd person replies, taking the position of the first
[02:25:17] <gerikson> that shit gives "hivemind" a bad name
[02:31:48] <indigo> Heh, that shit happens less on lobsters
[02:31:55] <indigo> The original person actually replies
[02:32:23] <edk> i've started to think that replying to the threads one starts is a bit of an unhealthy habit
[02:32:51] <edk> replying makes sense for conversations, but lobsters isn't really a conversational medium
[02:33:00] <kl1n3> there was a segment of people who found the message system being broken a very positive experience
[02:33:19] <edk> continuing such discussions in private message would make more sense to me
[02:35:17] <edk> you know that platitude about how we listen thinking with not the intent to understand, but the intent to reply?
[02:35:27] <ngoldbaum> imo reply notifications were a mistake
[02:35:44] <ngoldbaum> the site doesn’t handle deeply threaded conversations well
[02:35:45] <edk> well i don't think that's true anywhere more so than public arenas like lobsters
[02:35:53] <ngoldbaum> ditto people on the internet writ large
[02:41:56] <manicennui> I'm not really convinced that threading comments is better.
[02:42:54] <manicennui> This might be my favorite comments format: https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/01/google-kills-youtube-originals-its-original-video-content-group/?comments=1
[02:42:54] <buttsbot> Google kills YouTube Originals, its original video content group | Ars Technica
[02:43:36] <manicennui> Basically just better formatting of email-style discussions.
[02:44:08] <manicennui> Would probably work well on lobsters where the number of comments is generally lower.
[03:01:25] <manicennui> Earlier I discovered that the idiot who bought the Jodorowsky book made most of his fortune from this nonsense: https://afrotech.com/nfl-athlete-odell-beckham-nft-cryptopunk

[03:02:50] <manicennui> So basically he is rich because of another idiot.
[03:24:58] <indigo> +1 I don't think threaded comments are great
[03:25:10] <indigo> Maybe one level of threading, but no more
[03:26:14] <indigo> Reminds me of a project I worked on in the past, where execs were adamant that the commenting system for a crowdfunding website needed threaded comments
[03:27:01] <indigo> After adding a bunch of code for threading that requirement was promptly scrapped, but the schema remained the same, making everything very complex

[05:01:01] <companion_cube> "it is not sophisticated" seems to be the ultimate judgement
[05:01:15] <imode> it's more like "software does not fail because it cannot be repaired"

[17:31:30] <gerikson> you read a lot of SF
[17:31:35] <gerikson> it rots your brain
[17:32:08] <edk> i mean surviving on mars is just an engineering problem, we know how to do it
[17:32:12] <pja> Mars is like the south pole, but worse because there’s no Oxygen.
[17:32:47] <gerikson> I believe you can fly to the south pole if you really want
[17:33:25] <pja> edk: do we though? Short term, sure: a base that can’t exist without regular shipments of materials from Earth is prboably doable at vast expense. But an actual independent self-supporting colony on Mars? I don’t think we know how to do that.
[17:33:52] <gerikson> me neither
[17:33:53] * pja wonders if weechat has a spellcheck plugin.
[17:34:12] <edk> i don't think we know if all the minerals are available
[17:34:32] <riv> imagine if they just pour all this money into mars
[17:34:33] <riv> adn like
[17:34:39] <riv> don't feed humans on earth
[17:35:12] <edk> i don't think we could build an indefinitely self-sustaining self-contained ecosystem tomorrow, but i do think the problem is quite well understood and something where you could estimate how long we'd take to get there
[17:35:17] <edk> (and shorten that estimate by pouring money into it)
[17:35:18] <pja> Can’t help but think that all this rocket-building and mars colony bloviating is climate-change stress induced displacement activity.
[17:35:24] <edk> probably
[17:35:43] <riv> pja: absolutely
[17:36:01] <riv> we should literally stop with all the pointless space cowboy crap
[17:36:26] <pja> (I’m actually not against building a mars colony - have at it! But the idea that it’s ever going to be more than an experimental outpost that’s utterly dependent on Earth in the near future is for the birds.)
[17:37:18] <riv> I think im against it, it seems like a net negative overall
[17:37:30] <riv> not just because its elon musk
[17:37:39] <riv> but we have problem on earth that need priority
[17:37:57] <pja> We do a lot of “net negative” things for fun though. Why not send a bunch of jerks to Mars?
[17:38:14] <edk> because it wastes a ton of resources
[17:38:55] <edk> i don't actually think it's a net negative though
[17:39:30] <edk> setting up a long-term-viable martian colony is not going to happen soon for political reasons if nothing else
[17:39:44] <pja> edk: Sure, but in the grand scheme of things? Also, if it gets the launch capacity to do interesting things closer to home (radio telescope on the far side of the Moon! etc etc) then if Musk et al want to launch some rockets to Mars, fine.
[17:40:22] <edk> i'm suspicious that trickle-down science is a good model
[17:40:34] <riv> pja im not against *everything* fun :P
[17:40:58] <riv> fun will be allowed in modest quantities, as long as it doesn't get out of hand. ok?
[17:42:11] <edk> i do think we'll learn a lot by trying to set up a martian colony
[17:42:18] <edk> i think we'll probably even learn how to set up a martian colony
[17:42:41] <gerikson> the current "golden age" of space exploration is just one stock market crash from drying up completely
[17:42:47] <edk> but i'd much rather the knowledge and engineering legacy from that ended up in the hands of someone who is not elon musk
[17:54:21] <gwozniak> I think exploring Mars is something humans should totally do.  I don't think we need to make it a priority right now
[17:54:48] <edk> i don't think we should throw ourselves into it apollo-style
[17:54:48] <gwozniak> I certainly think it's possible and doable, though
[17:54:56] <pja> edk: I personally think the initial round of colonist is pretty much guaranteed to die in some kind of fungal outbreak or something.
[17:55:30] <pja> They’ll run out of a key resource at some point & that will be it.
[17:56:21] <pja> But the Apollo astronauts went up knowing it was probably 1/4 that they weren’t coming back, so...
[17:56:22] <edk> that depends to a large extent on how many dress rehearsals there are
[17:56:32] <edk> or more generally how overengineered for survival the whole enterprise is
[18:00:11] <pja> Thus far, the attempts on Earth have all failed. Biosphere II failed because the concrete kept on soaking up CO2 IIRC? Plus it had wild daily CO2 concentration swings & they needed a scrubber to prevent them killing everyone...
[18:00:45] <pja> It’s hard to get a small environment to stick stably to a point that also happens to support human life it turns out.

[18:17:35] <gwozniak> Most of my intense dislike for the tech sector is the complete and total misapplication of it
