[01:04:36] <companion_cube> if you're actually curious, btw: the servers are connected in a tree fashion (spanning tree)
[01:04:47] <companion_cube> so it prevents messages from going from A to B in 2 different ways
[01:04:54] <companion_cube> (no duplicates)
[01:05:09] <companion_cube> any connection failing means two halves of the tree are disconnected.
[01:05:59] <JordiGH> Oh, fascinating.
[01:06:05] <JordiGH> But servers relay messages?
[01:06:10] <ngoldbaum> yes
[01:06:11] <JordiGH> Why is it built this way?
[01:06:15] <ngoldbaum> you connect to leaf nodes
[01:06:29] <ngoldbaum> which connect to actual relay nodes
[01:06:30] <kline> hello
[01:06:37] <kline> im here to answer questions about irc and how libera uses it
[01:06:38] <JordiGH> kline: Europe is a great place.
[01:06:38] <ngoldbaum> so if any one leaf node dies that doesn't take out the whole network
[01:07:01] <kline> JordiGH | But servers relay messages?
[01:07:04] <kline> hence internet relay chat
[01:07:09] <JordiGH> kline: You guys still accept server donations like you did with Freenode?
[01:07:28] <companion_cube> JordiGH: it's built this way so that you don't see duplicates, but servers just have to broadcast to their neighbors, I think
[01:07:31] <kline> JordiGH, yes, but generally not from individuals just because of the "issues" related to reliability etc
[01:07:40] <companion_cube> if you had a more robust graph, you'd need to check for duplicate messages
[01:07:48] <companion_cube> which presumably means more ram and cpu
[01:07:53] <kline> companies tend to be easier to contact across a time span than an individual who may just appear/not on any given day
[01:08:01] <kline> its nothing personal
[01:08:09] <JordiGH> How about

[01:08:45] <JordiGH> Spanning tree determined by ping times, I guess?
[01:08:53] <kline> no, manual topology
[01:08:53] <companion_cube> idk how it's formed
[01:08:55] <Ticho_> afaik it's all manual
[01:09:15] <JordiGH> Oh so humans could be building sub-optimal IRC networks.
[01:09:43] <kline> we designate a number of hub servers and then link user-facing leaf servers to those hubs based on best network details
[01:10:11] <kline> generally ping is not so important, but you wouldnt want multiple transatlantic hops, for example
[01:10:36] <kline> so linking two EU servers via a US hub wouldnt be ideal, for example

[18:34:43] <gwozniak> tfw you are going to have to implement a pragma that enables a terrible coding practice, all because a customer refuses to change their code and is following a coding standard that is clearly trying to make C be assembly
[18:35:07] <gerikson> customer is always right, and often dumb
[18:35:27] <gwozniak> it's pretty terrible
[18:36:38] <varjag> #pragma sucks
[18:37:44] <gwozniak> Also, the customer says "This method also allows writing code that does not depend on a specific compiler."
[18:38:03] <gwozniak> Like... do you know what a #pragma is?
[18:38:10] <varjag> hah
[18:39:12] <gwozniak> I don't think people realize how much C is controlled by people who don't know much about software
[18:39:45] <gwozniak> I mean, this code I'm looking at is from a major vendor and is just terrible
[18:39:49] <gerikson> does anyone understand C, really
[18:39:57] <gwozniak> But, rather than change the code, the compiler has to change
[18:40:05] <varjag> C has the fewest letters so has to be the easiest to learn
[18:40:11] <gwozniak> ^
[18:40:48] <pe> C aliasing and implicit casts are pretty annoying to think about.
[18:40:57] <ngoldbaum> gwozniak: the code works and has always worked, also we’ve always been at war with eastasia
[18:41:18] <gwozniak> indeed
[18:43:49] <gwozniak> The coding standard dictates that the memory mapping be in a header file
[18:43:55] <gwozniak> Seriously...
[18:44:29] <gwozniak> I swear this is something devised 40 years ago in the era of assembly and was just adapted for C
[18:51:20] <gwozniak> But remember folks, C is easy!

[20:10:49] <af> Not easy but not as bad as English
[20:11:48] <pe> Slavic languages are rather easy within the group.
[20:12:18] <af> Certainly a lot easier compared to Sino and other tonal languages
[20:12:35] <pe> Very, very hard to acquire perfect knowledge, but 90% is easy.
[20:13:04] <JordiGH> I think more than half of the world speaks tonal languages.
[20:13:08] <JordiGH> Tones can't be that hard to learn, can it?
[20:13:25] <JordiGH> Most Indo-European languages (all languages?) use tones at least supra-segmentally.
[20:14:03] <technomancy> tones are *really* hard to learn without immersion
[20:14:31] <af> Modern Indo-European languages in the Northern belt of the Indian subcontinent are not tonal
[20:14:59] <scubagear[m]> Tones :(
[20:15:05] <af> Southern belt uses tonality to an appreciable degree but is not a significant part of the languages
[20:15:24] <pe> Czech definitely shits on all tones, although basic sentence melody is strongly suggested.
[20:15:50] <af> Sino languages on the other hand make me think I am tone-deaf
[20:16:06] <JordiGH> Isn't most of Africa using tonal languages?
[20:16:28] <af> yea I think
[20:16:30] <af> not sure
[20:16:41] <af> Don't get to hear African languages much
[20:16:42] <JordiGH> I think most American languages are also tonal.

[21:05:47] <JordiGH> I mean, why would you!
[21:05:50] <JordiGH> It's not a feature of your language.
[21:06:14] <malware> I do speak English as well
[21:06:20] <companion_cube> I mean, I'm also curious
[21:06:37] <JordiGH> Anyway, pitch accent is how "minute" can either mean a division of an hour or a very small thing in English.
[21:06:48] <Church> Ugh, folks
[21:06:57] <JordiGH> "MIN-ute", with the first syllable at a different tone and pronounce longer means division of an hour.
[21:06:57] <malware> some googling makes me think it's syllable stresses within a word
[21:07:10] <JordiGH> "min-UTE" means a very small thing.
[21:07:13] <malware> oh I see
[21:07:27] <Church> So what's going on here?
[21:07:51] <companion_cube> ah yes, the stress, I see
[21:08:26] <JordiGH> French doesn't have this, but to English speakers it sounds like French always stresses the last syllable of a word.
[21:09:51] <malware> I'm no linguist, but I wonder if that may be regional as well. I can think of some dialects that this is more prominent
[21:10:54] <JordiGH> I've only heard a few French accents but French intonation always seems to somewhat clearly indicate word boundaries by its intonation.
[21:11:14] <JordiGH> Well, I've heard way more Canadian French accents than European French.
[21:11:18] <JordiGH> Or African French.
[21:11:58] <malware> yeah the stresses in French tend to be for whole words
[21:12:02] <malware> in a sentence
[21:12:29] <malware> I can't think of any examples where it changes the meaning of a word, though
[21:12:41] <malware> other than the typical sarcasm inflections

[21:13:10] <pe> There does seem to be clear stress on the last syllable.
[21:13:30] <pe> Never really thought about it.
[21:13:31] <Ristovski> JordiGH: Speaking of that minute/minute example, its interesting how the brain manages to parse the right variant when reading text just from the surrounding context
[21:15:31] <epilys> offtopic ppl
[21:15:39] <pe> My language is first syllable first, reading French this way feels really wrong.
[21:15:52] <pe> Ehrm, first syllable stress.
[21:16:20] <JordiGH> Ristovski: Every language is full of ambiguity that's resolved with context. This is part of the reason why making a true chatbot is so difficult.
[21:16:31] <Ristovski> Indeed
[21:18:16] <JordiGH> So like Uncle Sam told Chomsky, hey, write us a language computer, and Chomsky was like no probs fam, I gotchu, and then he starts doing syntax parse trees and then he's like oh shit this is way more complicated than I expected, but CS fans were like, hey, no prob, forget real linguistics, we'll build programming languages with this instead.
[21:18:43] <JordiGH> So now we have SQL but we don't have chatbots.
[21:18:47] <rb> excuse me for interrupting this conversation, but i need some input. in my managed language i use something called "tracked values" which allows me to tell the GC "hey, please don't treat this object as garbage, the VM code itself needs that even if nothing else does". the problem is that currently i'm allocating one object per each of these tracking operations, and a basic script ends up doing
[21:18:50] <rb> 800k allocations in the VM code. i tried thinking of techniques to reduce allocations here but couldn't come up with anything. anyone have any ideas about what sort of scheme (heh) i can apply here?
[21:19:50] <JordiGH> I guess that's why the current efforts at NLP are like "screw parsing, just build an opaque neural network that statistically gets the right thing".
[21:20:31] <pe> I want a machine that reliably gets the wrong thing.
[21:20:49] <JordiGH> pe: Hungarian? When learning Hungarian, I was told to always "stress" the first syllable (another language without stress distinction).
[21:21:08] <pe> JordiGH: Czech
[21:21:16] <JordiGH> Oh, you said.
[21:21:25] <JordiGH> Funny, I thought most Slavic languages had stress.
[21:21:34] <JordiGH> It's hugely important in Russian.
[21:21:46] <pe> Polish uses second last (with exceptions).
[21:21:48] <JordiGH> To the point that stress is actually written down in Russian writing intended for kids and learners.
[21:22:16] <pe> Slovak also stresses the first, but it has a particular melody to it, so... I don't know.
[21:22:28] <technomancy> I like how Hebrew is like "written vowels? those are for kids and learners"
[21:23:43] <JordiGH> Russian writing with stress is annoying because they mark it on every word, like in Greek.
[21:24:02] <JordiGH> Spanish spelling is designed to only mark stress when it differs from the most common cases.
[21:24:04] <imode> rb: need a little more info, what are you using under the guise of tracked values?
[21:25:42] <rb> imode: so there's a Tracked object, and it can hold two kinds of values; Literal and Object. Literal doesn't allocate anything, just holds the literal value (integers, floating points). Object carries a pointer to a Tracker object on the heap. this Tracker object is added to the tracked set of a heap space when the VM decides to start tracking an object. if a garbage collection happens due to the
[21:25:45] <rb> VM allocating something on the object heap, during the GC the scavenger will make sure to update everything in that space's tracked set. afterwards you can call .getValue() on the Tracked object which contains the Tracker pointer to get the current location of the object in memory.
[21:25:48] <technomancy> one thing every language should copy from thai is อ์ which is a marker for "this letter is included in the word for bullshit reasons and you shouldn't actually pronounce it"
[21:26:18] <pe> rb: have you had a look at common GC designs? Your writting is hard for me to map onto that.
[21:26:19] <rb> note that the Tracker object is allocated on the program heap while the object it points to is on the managed VM heap
[21:26:36] <rb> pe: i tried searching it a bunch of different ways, however nothing relevant came up
[21:27:00] <Ristovski> pe: greetings, fellow czech
[21:27:15] * Ristovski technically even /more/ mixed slavic, but w/e
[21:27:16] <imode> rb: this is pretty complicated for what amounts to a flag on a particular object.
[21:27:40] <imode> you're turning what should be a constant flag on anything that's touched by the GC into a wrapper that's exponentially more weighty.
[21:27:53] <rb> the problem is that the object could move anywhere
[21:28:01] <rb> i have a generational garbage collector with scavenging
[21:28:09] <rb> this means that if an object is alive it's copied to a different space during scavenge
[21:28:18] <rb> this is why i need to have the address updated for me
[21:28:59] <imode> we need to unpack those two messages.
[21:29:32] <pe> Ristovski: a czemu twoje imię brzmi jak polskie? :D
[21:30:51] <rb> imode: how so?
[21:30:59] <imode> so you have a tracked object, which is designed to hold two kinds of things, base literals and object references.

[21:31:37] <rb> right, that object is on the stack
[21:31:46] <rb> it's just an ordinary struct
[21:31:58] <imode> and these object references are what you call "tracker objects"?
[21:32:36] <rb> the tracker object is a simple single-item struct allocated on the heap, which the Tracked object holds a pointer to if it's set to Object mode (tagged union)
[21:32:59] <rb> this Tracker object gets added to the "tracked set" of a heap space when we want to track a value across GCs
[21:33:08] <pe> Oh, I get your problem now.

[21:37:15] <pe> A handle of an object doesn't change when it's moved to a different memory area.
[21:37:24] <pe> It's slower and uses some more memory.
[21:37:26] <rb> ah, so like an object ID?
[21:37:33] <pe> Yep.
[21:37:57] <rb> that certainly makes sense, i have about 32 bits free at the top of the object marker word
[21:38:08] <rb> 4 billion objects ought to be enough for everybody
[21:38:08] <pe> It's at least /a/ solution.
[21:38:13] <rb> indeed
[21:38:21] <rb> less allocations but at what cost
[21:38:29] <rb> i should try and benchmark
[21:38:48] <rb> hmmm but will this mean that i will have to go across the entire heap space everytime i want go retrieve a value
[21:38:49] <pe> Ristovski: exactly, I've also reached that stage.
[21:40:44] <jmiven> JordiGH: be careful not to jump too much to conclusions, especially with loaded terms such as "ethnic pride". It might just be that Poles are used to being told that their native tongue is difficult. Or some other reason.

[21:44:05] <rb> that's certainly a way to do it, but what happens if the stack becomes very tall?
[21:44:32] <rb> i suppose you could avoid it by putting most of the language in bytecode, but still, you're going to have some stuff tracked per frame no matter hwat
[21:48:34] <rb> oh come on it's just a basic arena allocator with no shrinking whatsoever?!
[21:48:45] <rb> i expected more for some reason
[21:49:22] <rb> every thread has a "handle area" which is a constantly growing arena allocator
[21:49:30] <pe> There shouldn't be that many reasons to. Same-sized objects need no defragmenting.
[21:49:42] <rb> right, here you're only allocating 8 bytes
[21:49:58] <rb> maybe even 4 if you use compact addresses (since you know where your heap is, just take an offset to it)

[22:06:10] <technomancy> english might be the worst in terms of "largest amount of total suffering inflicted on learners"
[22:06:19] <pe> With Slavic languages, you need to internalize a solid number of tables.
[22:06:25] <urutau> doesn't every human language have some basic structure like subject-verb-predicate?
[22:06:26] <JordiGH> Same way that native English speakers have more difficulty spelling it than figuring out what a phrasal verb means.

[23:23:32] <blu> that was a good post to read, been messing around with image colors recently and gave me some ideas to try out
[23:24:20] <pe> Colours tend to give me nightmares nowadays.

[23:36:32] <gwozniak> I'm debating whether to patch Makefile.am or Makefile.in
[23:39:09] <gwozniak> Maybe I just punt on it and add an include in Makefile.in to hold the stuff I want to add myself

[23:40:53] <pe> Let's see what confusing behaviour gwozniak will exhibit.
