[21:21:21] <sibiria> hello. i have a problem with a recipe, ffmpeg, which appears to hold onto some cached view of PKG_CONFIG_PATH. it cannot see a dependency, but i can see it if i call pkg-config --list-all
[21:21:44] <sibiria> i can also see that the dependency and all of its files, incl. the .pc file, are where they should be
[21:21:58] <sibiria> pkg-config --libs --cflags returns correct and valid paths
[21:22:50] <sibiria> building ffmpeg thus fails with "ERROR: libssh not found using pkg-config"
