When I do this in the eshell, it DOES contain the info messages which mess up the input to the next program of course. So there is something

[04:34:32] <edgar-rft> okay, let's make moar terrible haikus
[04:34:33] <corwin> Case in point, I'm trying to make a thing that builds emacs from settings in an org-mode file.  This file will also contain the scripts (shell commands and such) to perform the build, and the (interesting) output from recent runs of each given version.  As it happens, the implicit 2>&1 for make-process happens to be exactly what I need, since don't seem to need to think about any of my outputs in terms of which output handle they were

[04:41:53] <twb> AFAICT fsbot's haikus are gendered because whoever coded it wanted to use pronouns and "always female" was easiest
[04:42:31] <twb> in principle that issue wouldn't happen in Japanese
[04:45:34] <zebrag> I don't think the "pronouns" explanation holds water for the haikus above. They are blatantly misogynistic.

[04:55:00] <Catie> Ah, I meant the limericks that shipped with Xenix
[04:55:01] <twb> er... adjective.
[04:55:06] <bpalmer> twb: you'll notice the use of 'His' pronoun in the dish-water blonde poem above. Both pronouns are present, if not to the same degree.

[04:56:34] <bpalmer> ah, adjective, hm. I would say that people are careful with née and né as adjectival forms, but that's both more explicitly French and would be a lie.

[05:01:20] <bpalmer> I found a reference to naif vs naive, but I don't think I've seen that distinction observed.
[05:02:03] <parsnip> bpalmer: the "his" in the haiku doesn't seem like a solid defense. it seems likely the "his" could be the master of the house, leering at the maid

[05:02:30] <parsnip> "oh my loins!"
[05:02:55] <bpalmer> parsnip: I'm not using it as a defense against anything; I was just pointing it was a masculine pronoun so they are present in the haiku database.
[05:02:58] <twb> I parsed it more like "DM uses feminine pronouns, players use masculine pronouns, regardless of actual gender identities"
[05:03:30] <bpalmer> parsnip: I do not understand the charges of misogyny, so I am not trying to defend anything.
[05:03:31] <parsnip> wtf
[05:03:45] <twb> I'm assuming the haiku script has three lists, onset-clause; medial-clause; coda-clause and just randomly picks an element from each
[05:03:52] <bpalmer> Yes, I believe that's the case.
[05:04:11] <twb> So if the author wants to use two pronouns, gender HAS TO come into it
[05:04:13] <bpalmer> I was quite pleased with the poetic form of "dish-water blonde" and cleaning silverwear, though.
[05:04:24] <bpalmer> er, silverware
[05:04:35] <twb> The fact it has romantic themes instead of seasonal themes is a bit shit

[08:47:11] <kitty1> twb: I wasn't referring to w3m in particular, I have seen terminal images implemented in several different applications to varying degrees; inline image support isn't that essential tho and if nobody wants to bother that one can easily be changed just by making sure I have good shortcuts for opening the images into a dedicated external application ; I suppose the bigger issue however is if there is
[08:47:13] <kitty1> any way to load LaTeX-like media inline with a terminal, which is much more essential. I figured the quickest and dirtiest hack would just be to use whatever image loader it would use, but suppose if a dedicated one would have more elegance on top of the fifty years of bloat work get the same quality then that would be a solution as well. Hmm, come to think of it, has anyone made any tools that
[08:47:15] <kitty1> would use pure, normal text to replicate enough latex features so that most maths would be readable yet? perhaps that *would* be a more elegant solution that would also perhaps work in an actual console as opposed to hacked onto a terminal emulator

[11:29:48] <Sketch> i don't really know much about them other than they lost to the CCP^WCPC

When attempting to use gnuplot within the context of Calc, Emacs says it can't find gnuplot on my system.

I know where the gnuplot.exe file is on my system. Anyone
[21:02:21] <bae> know what I need to do?

[21:05:05] <bae> Uh...I mean in Emacs...I don't think Windows has a PATH variable
[21:05:19] <grym> it does
[21:05:23] <grym> it's called %PATH%
[21:05:44] <Catie> Typing "variables" in the start menu should bring up the relevant window
[21:06:11] <bae> Oh...well, the directory where gnuplot is, is in Programs folder, and I'm pretty sure that's already a current path.
[21:06:47] <grym> you can set or edit that variable and restart emacs
[21:07:03] <Catie> It's been a while, but I'm pretty sure you have to add the paths individually
[21:07:16] <grtcdr> bae: no, you have to set it manually for each program
[21:07:21] <bae> Catie: What start menu? For Windows?
[21:07:27] <grtcdr> windows doesn't really have a central place for binaries

[21:07:40] <grym> and the list has a maximum strlen :P
[21:07:54] <grym> there's a third party envvar editor tool for windows whose name i forget, it's been years

[23:42:53] <parsnip> is this rude?
[23:42:54] <parsnip> > I didn't understand all of that, and the confusion might be compounded by your liberal use of the pronouns, "this" and "it". It doesn't seem worth clarifying, the main point seems to be that issue is closed. But maybe feedback for your GitHub comments in the future.
[23:43:17] <acdw> i don't think so
