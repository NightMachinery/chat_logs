[02:12:54] <borodust> dto Jach: new demo build is ready: https://github.com/borodust/alien-works-demo/releases/tag/v1
[02:13:01] <borodust> plz let me know if that one works ;p
[02:13:06] <borodust> or if it isn't
[02:13:34] <borodust> this time i took more care about foreign libraries being compatibly between themselves and with underlying system :)
[02:13:44] <borodust> *compatible

[03:28:14] <Jach> borodust: Still no dice, same issue with utils::io::ostream::Buffer::Buffer(). I also tried in a freshly installed Manjaro distro in virtualbox, same issue.

[04:06:16] <borodust> wattt ttttte
[04:06:51] <borodust> what's your CPU?)
[04:08:04] <borodust> bonkers, it shouldnt even use your system's libstdc++ even xD
[04:09:11] <borodust> maybe something in kernel...
[04:11:33] <borodust> Jach: are there any sort of liveusb for gentoo I can use to reproduce this behavior?
[04:14:04] *** Joins: Oddity (Oddity@user/oddity)
[04:46:01] <Jach> CPU is an intel i7, old 9200 model.
[04:49:46] <Jach> I think there used to be a livecd/usb that had a minimal xfce ui or something, not sure if it's around somewhere. Main gentoo site doesn't seem to have it, just the classic minimal that I assume is still UI-less
[04:54:41] <borodust> hmm, i'll look into that

[18:46:43] <borodust> Jach: Did you mean i7 920? I can't find 9200 model.
[18:47:26] <borodust> only Xeons
[18:50:39] <borodust> if you meant 920, then it is indeed quite oldish, and probably doesn't support avx i use in the binary, it's still weird though it breaks in c++ streams
[19:12:55] <borodust> i had a look at what it takes to get Xcfe running on liveusb and that's quite a process, i apologize, i'll have a look much time later :(

[19:43:18] <borodust> okay, it works on mint out of the box if only i didn't forget to ship libSDL xD
[19:43:22] <borodust> gonna fix that in a moment
[19:58:03] <borodust> yay! now demo v1 works on Linux Mint 19 liveusb out-of-the-box
[19:58:16] <borodust> this is kinda amazing
[19:58:21] <borodust> even to myself
[20:32:11] <rtypo> congrats! (tho i'm out of the loop)

[21:26:49] <borodust> rtypo: alien-works, common lisp system i'm working on full of foreign C++ libraries, finally has a working delivery framework
[21:27:12] <borodust> Linux part use AppImage format
[21:28:14] <borodust> my message was about this Common Lisp-based AppImage working on oldish bare OS w/o installing any additional software
[21:29:15] <borodust> from live cd/usb :D
[21:35:11] <borodust> alien-works is framework for making games (and other interactive media) that reuses a lot of gamedev C/C++ libraries but exposes them via lispified interface

[22:15:33] <rtypo> ah! I've heard about the framework. that sounds like a great success (and hard work, I suspect). thanks for explaining
[22:19:19] <rtypo> could we see games released with alien-works and AppImage this next game jam?
