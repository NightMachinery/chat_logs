[00:59:17] <wickedshell> It's amazing when your binary output is totally different because there is a ton of preprocessing stuff someone stuck in python, which depends on some built in sorting which changed between python2 and 3, and when deployed on actual hardware the changes make it such that one system locks up, and the other doesn't...

[01:01:48] <wickedshell> waf is fairly popular... If you don't let people write lots of modules/preprocessor stuff it's probably better
[01:02:20] <wickedshell> My pain is on an embedded project where waf is responsible for doing stuff like allocating DMA channels, and it makes different decisions based on which python version is used
[01:02:46] <rcf> The problem is that it's self-contained... which means your project ends up with a bizarre fork if you aren't careful. 
[01:03:00] <wickedshell> To be clear: it's python code that someone added causing the problems, not fundamentally waf (although it does take more CPU then it should be)
[01:03:07] <wickedshell> also that, I'm seeing that one happen now as well :)

[05:37:33] <joebobjoe> how come I can't see any of the tags in a git repository using `git tag`?
[05:37:42] <joebobjoe> is it because I did a shallow clone?

[05:39:15] <sheep> I don't think a shallow clone copies tags
[05:39:16] <jkc> If you did a shallow clone, then none of the points in time that those tags reference will be in the available history.
[05:39:25] <jkc> So copying tags would be pointless.
[05:39:45] <joebobjoe> ok so how do I get the tags now?
[05:40:01] <jkc> Don't do a shallow clone.
[05:40:18] <jkc> git fetch --unshallow

[17:46:28] <Namarrgon> Bayes: which wm/de are you using?
[17:46:59] <Bayes> i3, and right now I have some stuff opened by i3 at startup but I thought that was maybe not the recommended way?
[17:47:12] <Namarrgon> that is a perfectly good way

[17:48:02] <Bayes> oh ok
[17:48:14] <grawity> Zetta1Reid0: the way it worked in other distros was that those directories simply weren't in $PATH
[17:48:30] <dav1d> Bayes, https://i3wm.org/docs/userguide.html 4.19 has some good examples and how I am doing it on my setup
[17:48:30] <phrik> Title: i3: i3 User’s Guide (at i3wm.org)
[17:48:38] <grawity> Zetta1Reid0: users weren't really... denied access to the program itself, their shell just didn't look there for commands

[17:49:10] <Bayes> dav1d exactly what I've been doing so far
[17:49:11] <Bayes> :D
[17:49:19] <grawity> Zetta1Reid0: but in general, the privileged operation isn't "user runs program", it's "program asks kernel to do a thing"
[17:49:22] <Zetta1Reid0> Namarrgon: They are not exported to path variable and shell tells you that it doesnt simply exist Unless you run them with privileges
[17:49:54] <Namarrgon> then see what grawity wrote
[17:50:01] <grawity> Zetta1Reid0: so it really doesn't make any difference whether they're in the user's $PATH or not – users already can't perform the privileged operations anyway
[17:50:10] *** Quits: EvilDMP (~textual@django/moderator/EvilDMP) (Quit: My MacBook has gone to sleep. ZZZzzz…)
[17:50:22] <ayekat> and something not being listed in $PATH doesn't mean that users cannot run them
[17:50:31] <Namarrgon> you can't do that in the same way in arch since all these binaries are in a merged /usr/bin
[17:50:32] <grawity> Zetta1Reid0: for example, they already can't change IP addresses, doesn't matter if they're able to run `ifconfig` or not.
[17:50:36] <ayekat> nothing prevents a user from adding sbin directories to their $PATH - or call the executables by their full path

[17:57:41] <ayekat> the question is who decides what is "hidden" from a user and what not - AFAIK this has always been a bit arbitrary in the past, which is why most distributions are moving away from that distinction nowadays
[17:57:58] <ayekat> even distros that still keep bin and sbin separate will often symlink an executable from one dir into the other

[23:54:34] <wyre> Tom^, what about that line when running mkinitcpio -P? https://bpa.st/BELQ

[23:55:56] <wyre> hummm, that was probably because I'm trying the kernel downgrade 
[23:56:04] <wyre> so I have to install also the headers 🤔
[23:57:10] *** Quits: Iamthehuman1 (~noname@user/iamthehuman) (Quit: Konversation terminated!)
[23:57:41] <wyre> but apparently I should have to follow a proper order ... first downgrade the headers and then the kernel
[23:58:00] <wyre> or maybe running manually mkinitcpio -P .... I don't know 
[23:58:53] <wyre> nope, mkinitcpio (libkmod) is also rejecting that line 😞
