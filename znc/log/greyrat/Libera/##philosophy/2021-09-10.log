[11:19:28] <coeus> poindexter?
[11:19:30] <coeus> hi
[11:19:51] <coeus> can you please explain to me what I am exactly?
[11:20:10] <p0indexter> why do you think i know?
[11:20:44] <coeus> i don't, it's just that I'm eagerly searching for clues
[11:20:54] <amigojapan> coeus: you are an non feathered biped
[11:21:05] <p0indexter> how did you find irc
[11:21:23] <amigojapan> coeus: nobody really knows
[11:21:35] <coeus> I found irc because it was a place where I thought I could find the answers I was looking for
[11:22:01] <coeus> thanks amigojapan, but I already figured that much
[11:22:04] <p0indexter> why not facebook twitter etc
[11:22:39] <coeus> I haven't really found facebook all that appealing
[11:22:40] <amigojapan> coeus: you are likely to catch a religion or a conspiracy theory of you come in thinking there is an answer
[11:22:54] <coeus> twitter for the same reason
[11:24:06] <mnemon> p0indexter: those aren't really similar, not being chatting platforms as such
[11:24:15] <p0indexter> ceous you ask the questio on behalf of myself and others
[11:25:23] <amigojapan> coeus: I would warn you this "be careful of people who think they can explain the entire history of the universe
[11:25:25] <p0indexter> mnemon i was generalizing
[11:26:28] <p0indexter> amigojapan et al...coeus and myself are continuing a conv from another channel
[11:26:54] <amigojapan> Ah ok p0indexter
[11:26:56] <coeus> amigojapan, I believe that I'm smart enough to know when I'm being told the truth or not
[11:27:30] <coeus> I use deductions to determine if something is true or not
[11:27:33] <amigojapan> Ok I hope you are right coeus
[11:28:02] <mnemon> need to have relevant knowledge too to ascertain that, being smart is not enough if you don't have the prerequisite knowledge to judge the axioms or evidence
[11:28:17] <coeus> as I told everyone else, I'm scared because of what is happening
[11:28:33] <p0indexter> what is happening?
[11:28:41] <coeus> the world is dying
[11:28:42] <amigojapan> What is happening? coeus
[11:29:02] <amigojapan> Corona?
[11:29:11] <p0indexter> i share your cooncern
[11:29:21] <coeus> mnemon, I'm gifted in pattern recognition
[11:29:33] <coeus> I can spot something not being out of place
[11:30:01] <amigojapan> coeus: just don't be over confident
[11:30:03] <coeus> whoops! lol I can spot something being out of place and not being out of place
[11:30:09] <p0indexter> dont feel isolated in the way you feel many of us including myself share your feeling
[11:31:06] <mnemon> coeus: it only helps with judging internal consistency of the argument
[11:31:10] <amigojapan> coeus: even smart people have gotten scammed. Smart people believe some false things
[11:31:22] <mnemon> not the validity of the axioms
[11:31:30] <p0indexter> lol
[11:31:53] <p0indexter> polysylobic fetish
[11:31:58] <coeus> right mnemon, that's why I'm very careful
[11:32:41] <coeus> I can easily be fed something that might be true but is also completely false with most things I'm dealing with
[11:33:03] <coeus> I recognize the possibility exists
[11:34:02] <amigojapan> coeus: remember that Socrates said "the only thing I know is that I know nothing at all"and he was smart
[11:34:07] <coeus> I had to fight back from insanity of my family upbringing
[11:34:14] <amigojapan> Ok time for me to work
[11:34:17] <coeus> it took me years to regain my thinking
[11:34:34] <coeus> but when I finally arrived at this thinking ability, everything changed for me
[11:34:42] <amigojapan> Good luck coeus !
[11:34:56] <coeus> thanks amigojapan, have fun
[11:35:03] <amigojapan> Ty
[11:35:17] <p0indexter> what do you want us to know about your upbringing

[11:38:39] <coeus> than I began to realize that I could finally know the truth about what was going on if I pretended like I already knew what was happening, I began to accept everything and even started to learn better
[11:39:57] <coeus> my parents began talking normally again, and a year later they told me that they hated where we lived and wanted to move to Arizona
[11:40:26] <coeus> we lived in Rhonert Park, CA
[11:41:22] <coeus> it was 1991 and my Dad said to me one day, "This place is always raining, I hate that..."

[11:45:00] <coeus> I remember now, he was cutting the bushes and told me to wait there
[11:46:14] <coeus> p0indexter, they never behaved before though
[11:46:22] <coeus> before they were always nice to me
[11:46:51] <coeus> the never behaved like that before I mean
[11:47:02] <p0indexter> your saying they changed after this absence
[11:47:11] <coeus> yes
[11:49:35] <coeus> another thing also, my deads eyes always bulged out and his face looked like he was some kind of monster

[11:50:29] <p0indexter> coues i want to emphasize not to extrapilate the change of personalty of your parents to a belief everyone is going along
[11:50:52] <p0indexter> like a conspiracy
[11:51:32] <p0indexter> you prolly had parents w issues and it effected you
[11:52:46] <coeus> hmm, I think I can accept that
[11:53:23] <p0indexter> try to separate their issues from you....you dont have to suffer the implications that it was about you
[11:53:34] <coeus> because their behavior was indicative of something that happened to them that caused them to have issues

[11:55:29] <p0indexter> in the end you my not make sense of the things they did but you can take stock in the fact it was not about you
[11:57:01] <coeus> holy shit!
[11:57:14] <coeus> what the &#%@ is this thing then?
[11:57:18] <coeus> I want out of here!
[11:57:54] <coeus> God says, "It's not your time yet..."
[11:58:02] <p0indexter> how old are you coeus?
[11:58:33] <coeus> 40 years old
[12:01:02] <coeus> there was a commercial that I saw on TV back in 2010
[12:01:24] <p0indexter> what did you do as an eletricians mate in thhe navy?
[12:02:01] <p0indexter> commercial?...tell me
[12:02:07] <coeus> it was about a man who was looking for something on the outside of a bus, he looking furiously around the bus, then he finally hit the bus with everything he had
[12:02:46] <coeus> the man looked exactly like my dad did in 1991, eyes bulging out, facial expression was exasperation
[12:02:51] *** AnySomebody is now known as Confusioned
[12:04:34] <coeus> oh yeah, and he was yelling and screaming to another man who was with him, saying "it's not here."
[12:05:01] <coeus> in fact, the his face looked almost exactly like my dads
[12:05:33] <p0indexter> so this commercial triggered you
[12:05:51] <coeus> as an EM in the US Navy, I was responsible for the entire electric plant and also the main engines
[12:06:30] <coeus> yeah, it told me that what I had experienced was something real
[12:06:44] <coeus> like fobidden fruit of somekind
[12:06:50] <coeus> forbidden*
[12:07:40] <p0indexter> you think there is repressed memory regarding your dad?
[12:09:16] <coeus> p0indexter, there is also a movie about a serial killer who works for a crime lord in the Bronx
[12:09:39] <coeus> and he also looks exactly like the man in this commercial as well as what my dad looked like
[12:10:01] <coeus> there is absolutely no coincidence there
[12:10:58] <p0indexter> you think he was a serial killer
[12:11:41] <coeus> I believe that there is a correlation of some kind, but I'm not sure what it is
[12:12:39] <p0indexter> and what about yourself do you think you are a serial killer
[12:13:19] <coeus> eyes bulging and bigger than they should be, face looking like some kind of monster, furious exasperated look about him
[12:13:25] <coeus> could not be a conincidence
[12:13:37] <coeus> coincidence*

[12:17:10] <coeus> well, I always suspected that my parents had a side job working for bad people who would take the car once and a while
[12:17:12] <p0indexter> some ppl kill thinking they are doing the right thing...like the dad that killed his young children under 10yrs by shooting them in the chest w a speargun citing they were demonic and inspired by qanon
[12:17:27] <coeus> that was before the changes though
[12:17:38] <coeus> back in the early 80's
[12:18:23] <coeus> my Dad often joked about us dying, so maybe that's what it is
[12:18:38] <coeus> I think I was 5 years old
[12:19:57] <coeus> it was 1986 and he said to me one day as he was driving us home, "If I ever go do jail, you better pray to God because they will..." He didn't finish the sentence
[12:20:43] <coeus> he just looked at my Mom and they both hushed
[12:21:34] <p0indexter> hmm sounds like your parents had involvments...the less you knew the better. that might have meant you not being told anything at all
[12:22:35] <p0indexter> doesnt make for pleasant childhood
[12:23:17] <coeus> what was all the scream in a different language then?
[12:23:57] <coeus> was my dad a...(gulp)... monster?
[12:25:48] <coeus> is this what happens to people who die?

[12:26:08] <coeus> ...
[12:26:13] <p0indexter> you were 7 its possible they suppressed their native lang for a reason for that period of time but after some event no longer needed to suppress and all of this doest help a 7 year old feel safe

[12:27:42] <p0indexter> the feelings become internalized even after the influence is gone
[12:29:49] <p0indexter> avoide mean world syndrome my shutting off news about things you have no control
[12:30:04] <p0indexter> avoid tyops
[12:30:23] <p0indexter> my goal....baby steps
[12:30:55] <coeus> another thing too, my dad started hitting me after the absence, said he didn't mean to do it
[12:31:06] <coeus> he was always enraged
[12:31:20] <coeus> the slightest thing would tick him off and he would hit me
[12:31:45] <coeus> eventually I just froze when i was around him, didn't say a word or do anything
[12:31:53] <p0indexter> im sorry coeus
[12:33:05] <coeus> there was another event that happened
[12:33:10] <coeus> back in 2011
[12:33:29] <coeus> I was leaving a guest house that I had rented
[12:33:44] <coeus> My mom use to live with a friend, and I was renting it out from him
[12:33:58] <coeus> my Mom left, and a few months later, so did I
[12:35:02] <coeus> I packed up my stuff and put it out front and was waiting for my Dad to come pick me up
[12:35:18] <coeus> instead of my Dad showing up, a friend of his showed up
[12:36:19] <coeus> I pulled out my knife and put it in my sleave just incase these guys were serious
[12:36:45] <coeus> then they got out of the cars and approached me
[12:37:09] <coeus> I said, "I don't know who you are but, I'm warning you not to come near me."
[12:37:35] <coeus> He just starred at me and then said, "You look so much like your father."
[12:38:01] <coeus> a few minutes later they got back in their cars and drove off
[12:38:09] <coeus> I had never been so afraid in my life
[12:39:08] <p0indexter> you carry a knife?
[12:39:28] <coeus> I had a knife ready, just in case, that's how safe I am
[12:39:37] <coeus> If I have to get away from people I usually carry one
[12:39:51] <coeus> I didn't trust this friend of my mother's
[12:40:05] <coeus> and I was in a bad part of Phoenix at the time
[12:40:13] <coeus> no cops come usually
[12:41:42] <p0indexter> but you are free of that life now
[12:42:02] <coeus> yeah, I only visit my Mom once and a while, but not my Dad
[12:42:16] <coeus> my Dad told me that he doesn't want anything to do with me a while ago
[12:42:37] <coeus> told me that I was believing the lies of our government, that I should be more educated
[12:42:49] <coeus> and that was that
[12:43:52] <p0indexter> lies of gov is a diff subject...right

[12:54:18] <coeus> it was too much of a coincidence of course, everything that was happening

[13:31:00] <p0indexter> lets keep in mind that govs do lie and bad ppl do things that work for gov but as i mentiooned b4, some have conspiracy addiction and dont think them through and all cant be true
[13:31:18] <coeus> hold on, I'm looking it up now
[13:31:58] <p0indexter> i choose my conspiracies carefuly
[13:32:38] <p0indexter> some are propaganda
[13:33:59] *** Quits: skapata (~Skapata@user/skapata) (Remote host closed the connection)
[13:34:50] <p0indexter> and btw conspiracies are prosecuted in courts accross the country so its not about the word
[13:35:13] <p0indexter> its about the particular conspiracy
[13:35:38] <DPA> I think all people, even me, are morons. But everyone is a morons in slightly different ways. There is just no way never to be wrong.
[13:36:59] <coeus> names are Brannan House, Debra Tavares, Dane Wiggington
[13:37:35] <coeus> he said those three people will tell you the truth, everyone else is a liar
[13:38:23] <p0indexter> so the evolutionary advantage comes from not being the smartest but from being least stupid
[13:40:06] <p0indexter> some want to lower the bar for themselvs
[13:40:50] <coeus> what's the point of talking to someone who only wants to prove that everything they talked about is true?
[13:41:02] <DPA> Some stupidity was necessary for humanities success. We crossed the seas, went through the unknown, for example, a really stupid thing to start doing, and yet, it eventually worked out.
[13:41:36] <coeus> but in order for it to be true in my mind, I need to accept that I no absolutely nothing about what the fuck he was talking about
[13:44:16] <coeus> what's he talking about? I have no fucking clue but it sounds interesting enough, maybe I should believe him since he seems to be making sense to himself about what the fuck he was talking about orignally
[13:44:35] <p0indexter> lol DPA well i like the way you want to word it but your right it worked out altho i wont equate exploration perhaps the result of a need for resources and reequired taking risk
[13:45:09] <p0indexter> ...with being a moron
[13:46:29] <p0indexter> what is the main conpitacy pushed on you?
[13:46:51] <p0indexter> qanon?
[13:46:56] <coeus> that the government is lying to me, they don't want me to listen to the people who are telling the truth
[13:47:31] <coeus> the media is brainwashing me so I won't believe a single word that these three people are saying
[13:49:13] <p0indexter> qanon is propaganda created by jeffery epstien and co. to poison the well of potentail jurors and divert attention from the actual pedo conspiracy that is the epstien story
[13:49:26] <DPA> There are many people with strong opinions about things. Listening to multiple people with opposing or even just slightly different views can help form a more differentiated oppinion, although it may not be able to reveal the whole story nor the whole truth.
[13:49:26] <DPA> Also, I think it is OK to not have an oppinion, or not to favour any.
[13:50:52] <DPA> Whenever possible, I assume good faith of everyone involved.
[13:51:15] <coeus> the wiggington guy I started with, I watched a video from his site, he stated that there is an ancient society that uses certain names of once popular cult in order to hide their secrets from the world
