[01:56:37] <sussudio> if you type "x.txt", it will start up whatever is associated with txt too.
[01:57:11] <Khepra> could be easy to script something up, if it doesn't already exist. kinda like hitting "enter" in ranger, is aware of file extension and type and invokes appropriate program
[01:57:12] <WormFood> https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/start <-- sure doesn't sound like an alias
[01:57:45] <WormFood> Khepra, file extension is useless, and it means nothing for this type of tool
[01:57:50] <WormFood> I mean, under Linux.
[01:58:05] <WormFood> but, we have the "file" command, which is incredibly handy.
[01:58:19] <karlpinc> WormFood: I'm not aware of anything.  What you want is something that automatically invokes the update-alternatives "generic" name.  Preferably this would be done based on the results from "file" or similar, but I suppose working with extensions is a possibility.  Then there'd be extra code to recognize urls....
[01:58:41] <ede> and much better than this moder open desktop thing... exo-mime or what it was
[01:59:01] <WormFood> karlpinc, perhaps urls would be something else, depending on what type of tools you're leveraging
[01:59:21] <Khepra> ranger literally does all this, but it's a script and a switch-case
[01:59:29] <WormFood> It may be possible to just hand it off to the graphical shell, and let it handle it (assuming it can handle it)

[02:18:21] <APLU> it always crashes completely (reboot the laptop) when I start firefox, either from installed debian 11 (xfce), or from a live usb (debian 11 xfce & mate). If I start firefox with --safe-mode or with the LIBGL... said ealier that works fine. Reproductibility is 100%
[02:19:06] <WormFood> I was reviewing what you said before I was here.
[02:19:41] <APLU> the last test I will do is swap the two ssds with the "working" laptop and that one, they are exactly the same, RAM, CPUs, models etc.. only the S/N changes :)
[02:19:45] <WormFood> so, if you try it from a live usb, with either mate or xfce, then it crashes, but the laptop with the Mate desktop does not crash?
[02:20:08] <APLU> yup, the laptop with Mate doesn't crash
[02:20:09] <Khepra> APLU: did you try disabling the xfce compositor?
[02:20:16] <karlpinc> APLU: Sounds like a great test.

[02:20:51] <WormFood> It's not hard to swap desktops on debian. If you're using some form of GDM, then most (all?) will let you select your desktop when you login.
[02:21:18] <karlpinc> APLU: But you'd have to use the same software on both laptops to be sure the problem actually reproduces and there's not some wacko (unlikely) hardware problem.
[02:21:32] <WormFood> In other words, it should be easy to install Mate, beside xfce, and not disrupt it. You just get a choice now.
[02:22:01] <WormFood> karlpinc, what makes you think a hardware problem is unlikely?
[02:22:20] <karlpinc> WormFood: I was thinking going the other way, and installing xfce on the mate laptop and seeing if you can get a crash.
[02:22:28] * WormFood thinks hardware is just as likely of a culprit, as software

[02:22:43] <APLU> Yes I know I can install mate on that crashing laptop .. but it's late and it will be easier tomorrow to swap the ssd .. that will eliminate or confirm an hardware issue
[02:22:51] <karlpinc> WormFood: Because it's only firefox.  You'd think something else would eventually cause a crash.  Dunno.
[02:22:53] <WormFood> karlpinc, yeah, the logic is the same. Install 'em both, and see if that isolates the problem.
[02:23:23] <karlpinc> One way tests the hardware, the other the software.
[02:23:31] <WormFood> karlpinc, I have a computer that FF won't run on at all, and everything else works just fine, and it is a hardware "problem" (lack of SSE2/3 support)

[02:24:00] *** Joins: lumberjack123 (~alMalsamo@gateway/tor-sasl/almalsamo)
[02:24:05] <WormFood> so, FF (and chrome for that matter), do use some opcodes, that many programs don't require.
[02:24:12] <Khepra> APLU: I see
[02:24:20] <Khepra> WormFood: that's a rather very old cpu then
[02:24:45] <karlpinc> WormFood: I have what looks like a race condition with: chromium --temp-profile  It brings up a "blank" window, without even borders.  Sometimes.
[02:24:47] <WormFood> Khepra, indeed it is...it's a P3....also 1st gen P4 lacked that opcode
[02:25:27] <APLU> karlpinc: I didn't try any other software, firefox might not be the only one to trigger the bug
[02:25:55] <WormFood> karlpinc, that sounds like a likely problem. Race condition, or there was (IIRC) one other problem that can cause the same symptoms
[02:26:11] *** Joins: LtL (~debian@user/ltl)
[02:26:13] <APLU> but firefox does trigger the bug 100% time, maybe playing a video with vlc en full hd does trigger the issue too.. just didn't try
[02:27:33] <Khepra> APLU: I wonder, did you try running it from the command line?
[02:28:01] <APLU> but as that even does crash with a live usb with mate .. I think that will not be a software but gpu/cpu dying :/
[02:28:13] <APLU> Khepra: yup, I started firefox on command line
[02:28:14] <WormFood> I have a USB IR receiver, for my DVB-S card, and if I hit one specific key on the remote, it will reboot the computer. WTF?!? I've seen some weird shit over the years.
[02:28:18] <karlpinc> APLU: You can always try running memtest86++ while you sleep and rule out memory....  Can't hurt.
[02:28:27] <Khepra> APLU: any meaningful error?
[02:28:56] <APLU> memtest did run for 2 or 3 hours that morning without issue :)
[02:29:17] <APLU> Khepra: no.. or that display one I don't have time to read it
[02:30:10] <karlpinc> APLU: That sounds like long enough to bring everything up to a running, stable, temperature.  But maybe not long enough to run the complete test suite at "full temperature".
[02:31:36] <WormFood> I once had a computer, and if I ran a memory test, it'd run for hours, and as soon as I stopped it, the computer would crash in less than 30 seconds....it was bad memory.
[02:32:12] <karlpinc> What a great gag gift, for that special person.  ;-)
[02:32:20] <WormFood> The memory test, actually masked the bad hardware. The hardware ram refresh was busted, but the memory test, acted as a software refresh, so it'd work.

[02:33:32] <WormFood> for the record, that wasn't a modern computer. That one was actually a '286...but still, and interesting problem, and diagnosis

I had the keyboard on my lap, and I wipe the dust off the monitor with my hand, and the static electricity travels through my body, to the metal backplate of the keyboard....and it never worked after that (it was working seconds before)
[02:35:12] <APLU> but yes I can run it again that night :)
[02:35:52] <WormFood> I feel it's very unlikely to be a memory problem, because of several things....but, of course, it can't hurt to run it overnight.
[02:36:19] <WormFood> unless, it causes your computer to overheat, and it catches fire, and burns down your neighborhood.

Now this is in a foreign country, and I don't speak the language well, so that was fun. He runs the exact same memory test I used, and after the 1st or 2nd test, he says it's fine. I said it's bad at 54%. He
[02:39:19] <WormFood> thinks about it for a moment, and gives me a new stick of ram.
[02:39:39] <APLU> for the crash I took a video: https://www.aplu.fr/AZqhaWeOBT/petitminet/crash.mp4 .. nothing displayed on terminal

[02:51:56] <somiaj> as to why other programs don't cause this to happen, well browsers are a beast, could be other programs just aren't using the hardware as heavily as a browser will
[02:52:24] <somiaj> but doing bench tests with other pgorams, trying to push the machine to its limit and see if it crashes could help confirm this, but in day to day use the browser maybe the biggest power/cpu/gpu draw
[02:52:31] <WormFood> It's my understanding, is that it isn't really a gpu per se, but a repurposed cpu core.
[02:53:14] <WormFood> yeah, browsers have without a doubt, become a memory and cpu hog.
[02:54:27] <somiaj> but you did bring up a good point, maybe they should try other stress tests on the machine. Try to complie a kernel. Try to run other cpu/gpu heavy programs, if those cause it to restart, to me this will help suggest it is some hardware issue
[02:55:20] <WormFood> I don't think it's that, because it always crashes at the exact same point.

[02:59:41] <WormFood> wez, I overclocked my Q6600 from 2.4 to 3.0 Ghz, and that was worth it (but since the motherboard does not support overclocking, there was nothing to tweak, so no wasted time there)
[03:00:47] <WormFood> All I had to do was pop out the cpu, put a piece of tape over one the pads, and reinstall it, and I get 600 more Mhz out of it....actually, it changes the bus speed from 1000 to 1333

[03:15:02] <wez> WormFood: Logical in that you need to remember symbols which have specific meanings, derived from a story?  Or is that japanese
[03:20:11] <WormFood> wez, Japanese does use some chinese characters, but sometimes they have different meaning.
[03:20:19] <wez> ah
[03:21:32] <WormFood> wez, without going into too much detail, each character is made up of radicals. You can think of the radicals, like english letters, but there are about 200 of them....and some of them have 2 or even 3 different forms. These radicals make up all characters.
[03:22:35] <WormFood> most characters are ideagrams. That is, they combine 2 or more elements to create an idea. A relatively small number of characters, are pictograms. Frequently one of the radicals tells you the meaning, and another tells you the sound.
[03:23:44] <WormFood> So, sometimes, I can see a new character, and make a good guess as to it's meaning. I also frequently understand what a character means, but couldn't remember how to speak it.
[03:26:52] <wez> ah
[03:27:32] <WormFood> I've also seen chinese friends correctly guess the sound of an unfamiliar character, but not know it's meaning
[03:29:09] <wez> Clever

[10:11:13] <somiaj> blacked: many prefer testing since testing is at least guarnteed to have everything isntallable (less broken than sid), but transitions can be a pain, and security support is far slower than sid
[10:11:22] <blacked> archlinux is unstable too but debian sid

[10:31:20] <WormFood> APLU, you can't replace the part of the power supply I'm thinking of. It's part of the motherboard. The external brick, is not usually a problem, but after the (typically 19v) voltage enters the laptop, it is then regulated down to more "normal" voltages, like 5v, 3.3v, -5, and maybe 1.2v
[10:32:39] <WormFood> APLU, but, if you saw some of our conversation after you left, then you may want to try some of them. I know an easy test for you to try, to get a better idea, of what exactly the problem is.
[10:33:30] <WormFood> What I'd like to see you try, is to ssh into the problem laptop, from your good laptop, and run FF remotely, and login to the good laptop, from the problem laptop, and try the same thing again, and see what happens.
[10:36:20] <APLU> Yes I know voltage are stepped down, the dell onboard diagnostic tools from bios did some test too, but it's not under a "heavy" loaded computer.. as there is only their diag tools running
[10:36:34] <APLU> I can try to run firefox from SSH from another laptop, yep
[10:37:30] <APLU> FYI, yesterday I had the laptop running for 4 or 5 hours with stress-ng and it didn't crashes
[10:38:08] <somiaj> any gpu stress test done yet?

[10:38:50] <somiaj> no problem, I still think it is hardware related, but might be something subtle with the hardware (the restart is just strange)
[10:38:50] <APLU> somiaj: glxgears works, I do not know any gpu stress tools on linux?

[10:41:10] <somiaj> APLU: vblank_mode=0 glxgears (and then maxize the window) to try to push your gpu harder
[10:41:49] <somiaj> though I can't get it to work here, might be due to my clsoed source nvidia drivers though
[10:42:44] <somiaj> ahh here is one that works, env vblank_mode=0 __GL_SYNC_TO_VBLANK=0 glxgears -- This might make it push your gpu harder
[10:42:55] <somiaj> yea, my cpu is 100% now with that
[10:45:53] <APLU> I just tryied that before leaving, I don't have time to put it full screen, that reboot too.. so probably gpu issue yep :)

[13:06:34] <Lartza> Boot to rescue system and rebuild it? But can it be done from a different distro if that is the case?
[13:06:54] <WormFood> can you tell if it's pulling your kernel, and initrd from the hard drive, or does that live outside of your hard drive?
[13:07:17] <WormFood> a rescue can be from a different distro, if you know what you're doing.
[13:07:33] <WormFood> I've many times used knoppix to recover debian problems.
[13:07:52] <Lartza> I still assume it's KVM so it will pull my kernel, the one I select from GRUB
[13:08:07] <WormFood> now, to be fair, knoppix is based on debian, but it's not debian, and it has no rescue options. I just know how to do it manually (it's not fun)

[13:08:56] <WormFood> it was booting, right? And then it started with this problem?
[13:09:22] <Lartza> Well yes essentially, but a kernel update is involved in this

[13:18:46] <WormFood> I doubt it is your kernel that is the problem. It could be, but I don't think so.
[13:19:00] <Lartza> Well it's not initrd either
[13:19:15] <WormFood> yeah, once your chroot, and mount all the virtual filesystems, then nearly everything should work like normal.
[13:19:32] <WormFood> why do you say that?
[13:19:38] <Lartza> I rebuilt it and still got stuck
[13:19:51] <WormFood> did you update grub too?
[13:20:00] <Lartza> Yes, but it wouldn't matter when I used the same filename
[13:21:15] <WormFood> I don't know how your vm boots, so I can't say too much about that process. I know what traditional VMs like xen, it needs the kernel and vm outside of the vm.
[13:21:34] <WormFood> I mean, kernel and initrd
[13:21:41] <Lartza> Again I'm fairly confident it's QEMU KVM

[15:49:06] <rozie> Hi. I'm thinking about using compressed filesystem on my laptop, as it has only 256 GB SSD and backup of my /home is 33% smaller with gzip on standard setup. I already have separate, unencrypted /boot and the rest on encrypted LUKS. Unfortunately ext4 does not support compression. I read about brtfs, but there are stability/data loss issues with compression enabled. I also know that zfs has compression
[15:49:12] <rozie> support and it's stable, but there are license issues, so it won't be included in Linux kernel. Are there any other choices I should consider?
[15:50:00] <Khepra> rozie: zfs is installable and normally usable on debian

[15:53:36] <Khepra> rozie: also btrfs is quite usable if and when you know where all the dragons are, so you avoid them. afaik, compression is not one of them any moer. the debian wiki btrfs page is severily out of date
[15:53:54] *** Joins: i0e (~is0ke3@user/is0ke3)
[15:55:02] <Khepra> if you really need compression and a stable and sturdy filesystem to go with it, I really recommend ZFS (I use it everywhere, from desktops to workstations and laptops) but it has a steep learning curve and needs a paradigm shift in how filesystems operate.
[15:56:55] <Khepra> there's also lvmvdo but I don't know if that's available in debian's lvm2 implementation. I have no experience with it to recommend or not. I am not aware of any other transparent compression layer in linux. you'd think there'd be a device mapper for it but there isn't.
[15:58:18] *** Quits: i0e (~is0ke3@user/is0ke3) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[15:59:29] <rozie> I probably don't need all zfs features. I'm aware that it has snapshot support, block device support etc. but don't need it. Just need compression and encryption. I'd probably would like stick to LUKS with the later one, but will read more about it.

[16:01:09] <rozie> One more question about zfs - are there any pitfalls I should avoid with zfs? Like need for separate swap partition (normally I use swap in file) or problems with / on zfs?

[16:02:02] <Khepra> swap on zfs is only possible via zvols, and that only works for situations that are NOT under memory pressure; if you need swap to dampen memory pressure situations, then have separate partition.
[16:02:38] <Khepra> at the moment I am only aware of ONE problem with zfs rootfs. it's a long known issue that's appearing nondeterministically, and that's grub scripts failing to include proper root= entry into cmdline, so you have to force a static one yourself.

[16:04:04] <Khepra> if you do want ZFS rootfs, you'll need debootstrap installation from a linux env, this is a thorough guide: https://openzfs.github.io/openzfs-docs/Getting%20Started/Debian/Debian%20Buster%20Root%20on%20ZFS.html
[16:04:28] <Khepra> you don't _need_ bootpool, so you can skip that one if you want (I keep /boot on mdadm raid1 and ext4).
[16:05:25] <Khepra> there's #zfsonlinux for further help. some people advise using zfsbootmenu with dracut, instead of grub, tho.  https://zfsbootmenu.org/

[23:39:41] <karlpinc> iobus: I don't know.  If it was me, I'd look to see what the debian people do.  There's genisoimage for making the images.  Don't know what you'd do to build.  Not every package builds for arm64 (so I understand) so _just_ using the amd64 list of packages might get you some failure built-into the process.

[23:41:01] <iobus> @karlpinc the directory provide a packages list in each ISO, that will help at some point

[23:42:16] <somiaj> Though I think building the dvd images uses the pre-built binaries from the debian archive (This way they are the same binary packages that you would get if you just downloaded them via apt)
[23:42:16] <iobus> I will try for both amd64 and arm64 (for RPi)
[23:42:28] *** Joins: falk689 (~falk689-q@gateway/tor-sasl/falk689)
[23:43:07] <somiaj> the source images provide the source packages, but the dvd source images are not meant to build the dvd binary images, so I think you are trying to mix two different processes. That is using sbuild/pbuilder/etc to build all the binary packages you want, and how to put them all into an .iso with the debian-installer
[23:43:42] <karlpinc> kee: Was it you recommending another bit of hardware instead of the rpi?  (I'd like to make a note of it.)
[23:43:44] <somiaj> they dvd source images are just meant for those who want an offline access to the source package.
[23:48:31] <iobus> @somiaj 2 steps process sounds the way to do it.  no I'm not mixing it,  I have source-code packages, and I wanna install-able ISO/images from it
[23:49:54] <iobus> it's probable that debian project have per-configured scripts to make it
