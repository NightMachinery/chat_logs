[03:00:43] <amigojapan> Aurora_v_kosmose: I guess the idea is to work 24 hours 4 days a week and be in a come for 3 haha. But kidding aside. Microsoft Japan has been experimenting for a long time with a 4 day work week and they said it boosted productivity by 40 percent
[03:01:59] <Aurora_v_kosmose> amigojapan: If they're not doing weird shit, I'd presume it, among other things, is because having the actual time to properly sleep helps.

[03:05:49] <Aurora_v_kosmose> That's a rather unusual understanding of the term robot.
[03:06:23] <amigojapan> Aurora_v_kosmose: robots don't need to be humanoid
[03:06:53] <Aurora_v_kosmose> amigojapan: The origin of the word has more to do with Czech for serfs.

[03:14:24] <snake> your robot buddy will just start playing youtube videos on his screen-face
[03:14:28] <wroathe> Sxem: My guess would be that we're within 100 years of discovering a way to prevent aging and dying.
[03:14:38] <snake> after the ads...
[03:15:04] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Also, consider that building autonomous kill-drones is currently within the reach of a low-budget hackerlab.

[03:16:26] <Aurora_v_kosmose> (Incidentally the cost of building a lot of expensive government equipment goes way down if you disregard licensing, patents and copyright)

[03:19:49] <snake> like one time it just started calling like 10 people at once
[03:19:49] <wroathe> amigojapan: All I'm saying is that if I had Bezos money, I'd have a huge lab working around the clock trying to discover a way to keep me alive forever.

[03:21:56] <snake> Aurora_v_kosmose, recently walmart told me they thought i was there for my grocery pickup like several hours early
[03:22:04] <Sxem> in sci fi, you just have to make sure your telomeres dont get smaller to live forever

[03:22:38] <snake> Aurora_v_kosmose, so that's why i couldn't check in, and the only reason they knew i was there was because i used the parking lot number indicator feature

[03:23:12] <amigojapan> Yeah wroathe 
[03:23:25] <Sxem> i think AI will be the easiest immortality to achieve. well, a copy of you will be able to live forever, anyway. you will still die
[03:23:54] <Sxem> unless you transition to AI very slowly
[03:24:02] <Sxem> then it feels like you are the same person

[03:27:04] <snake> i think its probably an apple bug
[03:27:13] <snake> apple seems to have pretty bad software actually
[03:28:54] <wroathe> amigojapan: The national cancer institute's budget is $6.56 billion for fiscal year 2021. Bezos personally is worth $200 billion dollars. It's a numbers game, with an element of luck.
[03:29:09] <Sxem> some things can be brute forced. like folding proteins. theres an almost infinite number of ways to fold them, and maybe 1 in a trillion is useful. you can just spend billions to brute force simulate all possible foldings
[03:29:15] <wroathe> amigojapan: They're building on past research every day
[03:29:41] <Aurora_v_kosmose> snake: Ah I see
[03:30:49] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Imagine if all the compute wasted on crypto speculation was instead used for medical research
[03:31:13] <Aurora_v_kosmose> (Crypto as a currency/token of exchange is alright, but that's not the main use it sees right now.)
[03:31:40] <wroathe> amigojapan: Obviously I'm not saying it's a guarantee, but death by aging is guaranteed to kill all of us, while death by cancer only kills a few. If you and the people around you have avoided cancer so far it's usaully not on your list of priorities to see it cured.
[03:31:51] <wroathe> amigojapan: Contrast that with sure and pending slow death by aging
[03:31:58] <Aurora_v_kosmose> wroathe: 100% of people get cancer if they live long enough.
[03:32:05] <amigojapan> wroathe: it's not just a numbers game and bezos can't just spend all his money
[03:32:24] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Humans don't regenerate their genetic code properly.
[03:32:25] <wroathe> amigojapan: Well, I did say there's an element of luck involved, didn't I? :P
[03:32:50] <Aurora_v_kosmose> So it's 100% guaranteed. Interestingly, a preventative cure for cancer would probably cure senescence as well.
[03:33:05] <wroathe> All I'm saying is that if I had Bezos money I'd sure as shit be trying to find a way to stay alive forever.
[03:33:21] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Of course.
[03:33:48] <amigojapan> wroathe: it's not an element of luck. You are over estimating the intelligence of human beings
[03:34:11] <wroathe> What if we get another round of Panama papers that reveal that the wealthy elite have all banded together and pooled their wealth to fund immortality research
[03:34:20] <wroathe> amigojapan: This conversation is boring already
[03:34:48] <amigojapan> Alright wroathe 
[03:35:31] <Sxem> the most common cause of human death is heart failure
[03:35:48] <Sxem> cyborg hearts will increase the lifespan by at least a decade or 2
[03:36:12] <wroathe> Sxem: cybort hearts sounds like a band name
[03:36:12] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Don't ignore personality death as caused by advanced dementia.
[03:36:26] <Sxem> or you can just clone your heart and replace it with a fresh new young one
[03:36:26] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Being alive but an empty shell isn't much help.
[03:36:41] <wroathe> Aurora_v_kosmose: Jokes on you, I was an empty shell to begin with
[03:36:57] <Aurora_v_kosmose> wroathe: Not in the way I mean. You're at least functional chinese-room level.
[03:40:02] <Aurora_v_kosmose> The most horrifying part of those types of personality death is that you can feel it eating at your mind in moments of lucidity.
[03:40:51] <amigojapan> Aurora_v_kosmose: if you are lucky you will be at an old age home
[03:41:23] <Aurora_v_kosmose> I mean, at that point I'm left with the choices of OD-ing or taking the Hunter S. Thompson way out.

[07:03:35] <amigojapan> Hi good morning again
[07:05:47] <snake> amigojapan, morning
[07:05:54] <amigojapan> Hey
[07:07:01] <Nanobot> The next group of Hololive English members will be called Hololive Jungle, and will consist of a capybara girl, a panther girl, a dhole girl, a piranha girl, and an ice cream truck driver. The ice cream truck driver fits into the theme, because she delivers ice cream in the jungle.
[07:07:29] <snake> hololive conveyor belt is on full steam
[07:07:51] <amigojapan> Lol Nanobot 
[07:09:12] <MootPoot> Nanobot: It's time to decommission jpeg from chromium 
[07:09:55] <amigojapan> MootPoot: replace it with what. You need a compressed image format
[07:10:09] <amigojapan> Lossy
[07:10:35] <Nanobot> MootPoot: If you make the data formats less expensive, it'll only cause websites to do other things to use even more data.
[07:12:28] <Nanobot> MootPoot: Also, I haven't read the article (it seems to be behind a paywall), but it sound VERY suspicious to me. Like, to the point where I would feel very confident saying that making JPEGs more efficient would NOT reduce global Internet data use by 30 percent.
[07:12:55] <amigojapan> Man I am glad MootPoot is not the head of a serious commission. He has extreme ideas
[07:14:45] <amigojapan> You can't just decommission something that is being used currently by so many people
[07:15:52] <amigojapan> Hey MootPoot 
[07:17:15] <S_T_A_N> amigojapan, In some cases that's the only way. look at flash
[07:17:46] <Nanobot> MootPoot: The numbers I'm seeing show that JPEG XL typically offers a 20% file size reduction over standard JPEG. *Maybe* a 30% reduction in ideal circumstances. And that's a reduction in the size *of JPEGs*, not overall global data usage.
[07:18:19] <amigojapan> S_T_A_N: flash died a slow death. It was not just suddenly decommissioned
[07:18:40] <Nanobot> In terms of overall data usage, I bet JPEGs account for a very small amount compared to things like video streaming and BitTorrent.
[07:19:06] <amigojapan> S_T_A_N: and a replacement was also developed before hand
[07:19:09] <S_T_A_N> amigojapan, It literally just was suddenly decommissioned, even with the notice given notice many many many people were caught with their pants down
[07:20:17] <Nanobot> A 20% file size reduction is not enough to get everyone to want to switch over. Especially since it's bound to have more uncertainty regarding patents.
[07:20:40] <amigojapan> S_T_A_N: no. It was never even part of Chrome. Adobe just stopped developing it
[07:21:46] <Nanobot> Flash was bundled in Chrome for a while. But yeah, Adobe dropped support long ago, and then browsers removed it since it was a security concern.
[07:21:49] <S_T_A_N> amigojapan, Yes it was. It was built into chrome. First browser to do that irrc. Adobe did not just stop developing it. The full on EOL it. Microsoft built it into Windows to disable and block Flash. 
[07:22:16] <MootPoot> amigojapan: You can, just give a date of about a year to leave it, and on the deadline remove support. Done. Like any other major online platform does.
[07:22:39] <MootPoot> Boop
[07:22:51] * MootPoot presses the big red button
[07:22:59] <amigojapan> S_T_A_N: you could still just install flash for the longest time
[07:23:08] <S_T_A_N> Like literally that's what it took to actually kill Flash. Nothing short of that would have done it. Flash has been dead for almost a decade and it still was neccerry right up to the date that they pressed the big red button

[07:26:24] <Nanobot> JPEG XL doesn't seem good enough to replace JPEG, though. I'd want to see *at least* a 50% reduction over JPEG before even considering converting all my existing JPEGs over to it. And even then, I probably wouldn't bother, because JPEG is good enough. Even a very large JPEG file transmits very quickly these days.

[07:42:46] <S_T_A_N> No one got sued. 
[07:42:48] <S_T_A_N> Yet.
[07:43:31] <amigojapan> S_T_A_N: flash if a program that resided in many browsers. Not even a program that ran on the OS directly. The browsers would be the only ones that can block it
[07:43:55] <amigojapan> S_T_A_N: maybe for internet explorer
[07:44:10] <amigojapan> But that is not a big deal
[07:44:33] <S_T_A_N> It did run on the OS. Before it was built into browsers it was just a exe you installed. Then it got built into browsers and Windows as well

[07:50:21] <S_T_A_N> One day it worked. The next day it didn't.
[07:50:23] <amigojapan> Let me see S_T_A_N 
[07:50:33] <S_T_A_N> Microsoft killed it on windows. 
[07:50:40] <S_T_A_N> Finally for good
[07:51:20] <Poeticode> amigojapan you can only download flash for windows on a torrent site now
[07:51:28] <TurkeyNoises> why would you
[07:51:37] <Poeticode> Adobe doesn't support anymore and stopped offering downloads for it
[07:52:43] <S_T_A_N> TurkeyNoises, I know someone who has flash screensavers. He would if he was technically capable of knowing how. 
[07:52:51] <amigojapan> S_T_A_N: that just days Microsoft removed it from Windows, not that they blocked it from running
[07:53:16] <S_T_A_N> We have to protect people from themselves by killing old bad tech like this
[07:53:25] <S_T_A_N> Kill it hardstop. 
[07:53:32] <mixfix41> yours is a bad example is more technical that topic 
[07:53:39] <mixfix41> you can install plugins manually
[07:54:10] <S_T_A_N> amigojapan, Yes. They got rid of it. You can't install it uless you have a saved installer and in a few weeks they will run an update that literally uninstalls it if it's installed that way
[07:54:54] <S_T_A_N> mixfix41, if you have the installer still. Adobe don't distribute it. Gotta get it from some shady website, who knows what you are downloading actually 
[07:54:56] <amigojapan> S_T_A_N: no they can't do that, you are just making it up
[07:55:08] <S_T_A_N> amigojapan, It literally says that on their blog
[07:55:13] <mixfix41> you can hit up the oregon repo they have a package or two
[07:55:32] <mixfix41> i suggest you see for yourself
[07:55:39] <TurkeyNoises> S_T_A_N: ‚Ä¶Flash‚Ä¶ screensavers??????/
[07:55:44] <S_T_A_N> TurkeyNoises, I know right

[07:59:32] <dfch> I mean even after KB4577586 and built-in timebomb in flashplayer itself you still can patch it (i.e. https://github.com/KuromeSan/FlashPatcher/releases/tag/v1.7 ) but why would you want to do it in the first place?

[07:59:40] <amigojapan> Yes TurkeyNoises 
[07:59:45] <S_T_A_N> amigojapan, the fact that you can't officially get an installer for it now make it so. If it's not a component of windows you can't get it. Unless you want to pray you don't end up with a virus from an opportunistic site offering flash for the desperate. Flash was hardstop killed by Microsoft with that update. 
[07:59:46] <dfch> I mean windows is eww... but flash is double eww
[07:59:56] <mixfix41> also i think you have a argument it falls under game development if the podcast ive listen to it reminds me
[08:00:03] <mixfix41> i think windows might head that direction
[08:00:06] <mixfix41> not that they have
[08:00:17] <mixfix41> and its not a direction they could do it
[08:00:40] <amigojapan> S_T_A_N: that is because Adobe stopped developing it
[08:00:47] <mixfix41> except that the industry does it
[08:00:50] <mixfix41> openly
[08:01:00] <mixfix41> not that microsoft blocks it in app
[08:01:01] <TurkeyNoises> I thought flash had been dead for a while now, why is this a thing today?
[08:01:04] <S_T_A_N> amigojapan, that happened years ago and it kept being used

[08:02:15] <Poeticode> how many people are wanting flash in 2021? this seems like a good monero mining opportunity
[08:02:18] <MootPoot> amigojapan:  wrong
[08:02:21] <MootPoot> I didnt say that
[08:02:30] <MootPoot> I said "chromium" should decommision jpeg
[08:02:32] <S_T_A_N> And if something better enough than jpeg existed, or if jpeg was super dangerous, then MootPoot would be right 
[08:02:48] <amigojapan> Ok MootPoot 
[08:02:58] <dfch> also I get what amigojapan saying:  update will remove Flash from the operating system, but only Flash made available by Microsoft. Flash installed through third-party applications, e.g. a browser that comes with a Flash component, is not removed by the update. Put simply, any Flash version that has been installed manually by the user, e.g. through
[08:02:58] <dfch> the installation of Flash or a program that comes with a Flash component, is not affected by the update.
[08:03:03] <MootPoot> chromium would include all the other major browsers as well

[08:03:32] <MootPoot> by about 20% plus some extra features
[08:03:46] <S_T_A_N> MootPoot, Is it better enough to warent it though?

[08:05:45] <amigojapan> MootPoot: you can add new things without decommissioning older things
[08:05:56] <S_T_A_N> TurkeyNoises, Is it? I don't see a lot of that. My blockers are better than their blocker blockers
[08:06:01] <TurkeyNoises> You've read ONE article from our site in the last year, think of how much you're hurting us
[08:06:20] <Poeticode> just prepend archive.md/ to any URL and you can avoid paywalls, and modern browsers have good reading modes to exclude all the ads / styling
[08:06:26] <MootPoot> amigojapan:  true, but once the new and better version is in place and is working stable, maintaining the old is just a waste
[08:06:27] <dfch> S_T_A_N, here is an example, I have old flash installer (obtained from adobe), it exists ;)

[08:24:18] <mixfix41> is polio novel disease
[08:24:26] <TurkeyNoises> which is how we should be with more things, but we can't because too many people are afraid of science
[08:24:26] <amigojapan> I see TurkeyNoises 
[08:24:28] <Roey> S_T_A_N: heh I know heheheh
[08:24:35] <TurkeyNoises> mixfix41: no, novel means new
[08:25:06] <TurkeyNoises> amigojapan: by the way, I'm TurkeyNoises today to be patriotic, because it was almost our national bird (and I don't want to ONLY use it on thanksgiving)
[08:25:06] <mixfix41> so it starts from humans where it began then
[08:25:10] <S_T_A_N> TurkeyNoises, need to become what they fear, full on force it
[08:25:35] <wroathe> I'm no epidemiologist, but I'm guessing the virus strain also has to do with the likelihood of mutation. Polio is a different strain of virus than the coronaviruses
[08:25:50] <amigojapan> Happy independence Day TurkeyNoises 
[08:25:54] <TurkeyNoises> wroathe: it's not a different strain, it's a whole different type of virus entirely
[08:26:00] <MootPoot> can we cure covid-19 with duct tape
[08:26:02] <S_T_A_N> Happy Treason Day.
[08:26:04] <TurkeyNoises> viruses can be pretty damn different from each other, y'all
[08:26:05] <MootPoot> I'm sure its possible
[08:26:05] <wroathe> TurkeyNoises: That's what I mean by "strain"
[08:26:12] <dfch> MootPoot, no you can't
[08:26:13] <S_T_A_N> Brexit 1776 WOOP WOOP
[08:26:16] <TurkeyNoises> that's like saying giraffes are a different strain of polar bear
[08:26:18] <MootPoot> dfch:  bullshit
[08:26:39] <dfch> MootPoot, weak troll is weak
[08:26:47] <wroathe> TurkeyNoises: Eh, more like saying giraffes are a different strain of mammal than a polar bear
[08:26:52] <MootPoot> Its not a troll its true
[08:26:57] <MootPoot> :(
[08:26:58] <S_T_A_N> MootPoot, you can' Duct tape the people that refuse to vaccinate and give it to em
[08:27:01] * MootPoot feels abused
[08:27:04] <TurkeyNoises> wroathe: anyway it's not what strain means 
[08:27:04] <MootPoot> S_T_A_N:  perfect
[08:27:15] <MootPoot> see dfch , S_T_A_N  knows how to do it
[08:27:25] <MootPoot> duct tape can solve anything
[08:27:35] <wroathe> TurkeyNoises: I wasn't using it formally to mean a specific thing
[08:27:45] <S_T_A_N> Or duct tape them and drop em in the sea
[08:27:48] <wroathe> TurkeyNoises: So take your armchair medical degree somewhere else :P
[08:27:49] <dfch> only if you minmatar, sure
[08:27:49] <S_T_A_N> or a volcano 
[08:28:17] <TurkeyNoises> wroathe: I mean it's a word with a specific technical meaning, don't just use it to mean something totally different but kinda-sorta related and get mad when you get called out on it
[08:28:29] <MootPoot> speaking of armchairs
[08:28:34] <S_T_A_N> lol
[08:28:43] <MootPoot> I was thinking of getting one of those expensive ergo chairs
[08:28:45] <MootPoot> for 1k
[08:28:47] <dfch> eh, spreadsheets online reference in 2021, *sigh*
[08:28:48] * wroathe rolls eyes
[08:28:55] <MootPoot> you know, those herman millers
[08:28:57] <MootPoot> and stuff
[08:28:58] <S_T_A_N> wroathe, he's not wrong.
[08:29:05] <wroathe> TurkeyNoises: You do a lot of this "calling out" on the internet, do you?
[08:29:15] <S_T_A_N> MootPoot, My office for Herman Millers. I hate them
[08:29:20] <S_T_A_N> got*
[08:29:24] <TurkeyNoises> wroathe: words mean things, if you use random other words than the one you mean, you don't communicate
[08:29:33] <S_T_A_N> maybe it's because they were cheap ones
[08:29:34] <MootPoot> S_T_A_N:  which models? why do you hate them?
[08:29:42] <MootPoot> are they aerons?
[08:29:49] <wroathe> This is ruining my strain of thought
[08:29:52] <S_T_A_N> MootPoot, The seat is not long enough. 
[08:29:53] <MootPoot> the chepeast hermans are like 1.5k each
[08:30:36] <TurkeyNoises> see, strain of thought is less obnoxious because it just sounds like you're using a totally random word, rather than a word that's in the right category but incorrect
[08:30:53] <wroathe> TurkeyNoises: It's now time for you to be quiet
[08:31:01] <S_T_A_N> MootPoot, I am looking at this for my home office if I ever get that much money together for a chair https://store.steelcase.com/seating/office-chairs/leap-plus

[08:31:25] <TurkeyNoises> so who is wroath?
[08:31:27] <MootPoot> S_T_A_N:  oh yeah, I was considering that too
[08:31:35] <dfch> now now wroathe, let's be nice to each other, and not shut each other up
[08:31:45] <S_T_A_N> strain of thought is the dumbist thing I have ever heard spoken

[08:32:51] <MootPoot> S_T_A_N:  have you tried out that chair before?
[08:32:52] <dfch> wroathe, I see, may I recommend a higher road of /ignore then? :)
[08:33:14] <mixfix41> yea novel in corona case means jumping from animals to humans thats how it is being mention by
[08:33:18] <wroathe> dfch: I'm open to ideas. The one requirement I have is that I don't read any more of what that person has to say.
[08:33:30] <wroathe> dfch: If you know of a better way than /ignore to accomplish that, then I'm all ears.
[08:33:31] <S_T_A_N> MootPoot, not yet. I need to if I can
[08:33:37] <TurkeyNoises> mixfix41: I mean "novel" means new in that case too, as in a new virus
[08:33:41] <mixfix41> it wasnt scientifically known before
[08:33:58] <S_T_A_N> lol TurkeyNoises they ignored you
[08:34:00] <mixfix41> to able to 
[08:34:03] <dfch> wroathe, wonderful, that exactly what /ignore does
[08:34:07] <TurkeyNoises> S_T_A_N: mixfix did?

[08:34:47] <S_T_A_N> sentionics, I drank like one beer 6 hours ago and I think I am drunk

[08:35:07] <mixfix41> well fun or i mean interesting
[08:35:08] <TurkeyNoises> S_T_A_N: we can just blame sentionics for getting us both contact drunk
[08:35:25] * S_T_A_N high fives TurkeyNoises

[08:39:34] <amigojapan> TurkeyNoises: does the covid vaccine offer any protection against getting seriously ill if you do get covid?
[08:39:39] <TurkeyNoises> MootPoot: the safe word is "yes, harder"
[08:39:51] <TurkeyNoises> amigojapan: yes, that's like half the point
[08:39:56] <S_T_A_N> amigojapan, there is evidence it does
[08:40:10] <dfch> amigojapan, that's basically why you should get it in teh 1st place
[08:40:16] <MootPoot> does the covid vaccine do anything against other covid strains?
[08:40:17] <TurkeyNoises> amigojapan: if you get the vaccine you're basically just not going to end up in the hospital if you get it
[08:40:20] <amigojapan> I see TurkeyNoises S_T_A_N dfch 
[08:40:22] <MootPoot> like if covid-20 showed up tommorow

[08:40:32] <MootPoot> are we fucked non-consentually
[08:40:42] <S_T_A_N> MootPoot, we can't really know I think
[08:40:47] <TurkeyNoises> MootPoot: I mean, it'll help against whatever subset of covid strains are close enough, and not against others
[08:41:02] <TurkeyNoises> MootPoot: as I've pointed out a bunch, you've probably had like 100 corona viruses in your life before
[08:41:09] <MootPoot> wat
[08:41:17] <TurkeyNoises> but most were little wimpy viruses, and this is the big weight lifter roided up virus
[08:41:18] <S_T_A_N> also it would be COVID-21 
[08:41:24] <S_T_A_N> We are beyond 20 LUL
[08:41:27] <MootPoot> I'm a covid victim and I dont know about it?

[08:41:48] <S_T_A_N> TurkeyNoises, it's hard to remember 
[08:42:08] <dfch> MootPoot, have you ever had cold?
[08:42:09] <TurkeyNoises> MootPoot: we've all had them, a fair amount of the random minor colds you have had before were corona viruses
[08:42:11] <dfch> https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/general-information.html
[08:42:12] <ImoutoBot> [title] Common Human Coronaviruses | CDC
[08:42:46] <MootPoot> but I never had the vaccine for those
[08:42:49] <TurkeyNoises> MootPoot: and just like the flu, there are different ones every year, some are worse than others
[08:42:59] <MootPoot> you're saying I survived cuz I had genetic resistance?
[08:43:00] <TurkeyNoises> MootPoot: yeah, you didn't need one, other than for SARS
[08:43:04] <TurkeyNoises> which didn't get into the US much
[08:43:13] <TurkeyNoises> MootPoot: no, you survived because barely anyone died
[08:43:14] <MootPoot> we have a sars vaccine?
[08:43:38] <dfch> > tfw when in China during SARS and COVID19
[08:43:52] <MootPoot> what about MERS
[08:44:35] <dfch> I was in UAE for short trip, right before MERS so almost bingo
[08:44:44] <TurkeyNoises> you probably haven't had it MootPoot, you'd know

[08:45:01] <MootPoot> for all my life
[08:45:15] <MootPoot> I get sick once a year for like 2-3 weeks
[08:45:37] <TurkeyNoises> MootPoot: maybe dogs are a better analogy. Most corona viruses are like getting attacked by a chihuahua, this is a doberman
[08:45:42] <TurkeyNoises> but both are dog attacks
[08:45:45] <S_T_A_N> I don't even get sick that often LUL
[08:46:25] <dfch> also in Angola right after '05 Marburg outbreak
[08:46:29] <TurkeyNoises> MootPoot: the scary thing is that now some of the things that make this virus more deadly are going to be around in the bigger gene pool, basically, so chances of another bad one get worse
[08:46:35] <S_T_A_N> Last time I was sick was December 2019 with a cold maybe. Or flu. Or very early covid.
[08:46:40] <TurkeyNoises> and would have been less bad if we'd been faster to lock stuff down at the start
[08:47:03] <S_T_A_N> Before that.... I was clear for years and years
[08:47:47] <TurkeyNoises> I get sick a lot, but I've always had family members who are public school teachers
[08:47:59] <TurkeyNoises> so I get indirectly exposed to all the snot nosed little brats

[09:16:37] <S_T_A_N> ButterNoodle, there are no diferent types. There is velcro, and there is hook and loop

[18:18:19] <theholyduck> emmeka: i think the point he makes and the reason i would use the word. is that its clear in geography and time

[18:18:42] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: yeah I never heard of it
[18:18:44] <theholyduck> emmeka:  he makes the point that its like calling somebody living in sweden a native-afroeurasian 
[18:18:49] <emmeka> theholyduck these terms get weird. it's like "eskimo".
[18:18:53] <DunceCotus> amigojapan its not about blaming a single individual though, sure
[18:18:56] <emmeka> here, eskimo is considered a slur.
[18:19:04] <theholyduck> technically anyone living in sweden is a native afro-eurasian
[18:19:09] <dfch> davic, would love to, but japan borders aren't opened yet
[18:19:10] <theholyduck> but its a term so broad. its meaningless
[18:19:23] <theholyduck> because somebody living on the steppes of mongolia or in vietnam
[18:19:26] <dfch> at least for me :|
[18:19:29] <theholyduck> would also be afro-eurasians
[18:19:32] <emmeka> but in Alaska, eskimo is the accepted umbrella term to refer to Inupiaq and Aleut
[18:19:48] <theholyduck> or in the depths of congo
[18:20:07] <Sumida> afro makes me think of a ball of hair
[18:20:15] <davic> dfch: theholyduck's legs are opened for you though
[18:20:37] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: it ends up in discrimination against Asians
[18:20:40] <theholyduck> the history of natives in central and south america are very different from the people of the continental united states. and again somewhat different from the natives even further notrth
[18:20:45] <dfch> same for Philippines or Taiwan or even North Korea *sigh*
[18:20:47] <emmeka> theholyduck the difference is that with literally 1 exception, all "Native Americans" from Patagonia to the northwest passage share a common ancestor.
[18:20:50] <theholyduck> using the same term for all of them makes the term useless

[18:21:13] <dfch> not cute enough

[18:24:32] <emmeka> yes well I'm going to say white yankee expat in London should probably care less about the logical reason why a term should be used and care more about the political connotations
[18:25:28] <DunceCotus> amigojapan right, its not about blaming an ethnicity or peoples or individual
[18:25:46] <DunceCotus> amigojapan its more about targeting organisations, institutions
[18:25:52] <DunceCotus> companies
[18:26:21] <theholyduck> DunceCotus: anyways. amigo isnt making a great argument for it  heres my reason why i dont want conspiracy peddling
[18:26:33] <theholyduck> its impossible to argue with a conspiracy theorist about anything. 
[18:26:42] <theholyduck> and i dont want this to be the sort of place
[18:26:48] <theholyduck> that welcomes that type of thinking
[18:26:55] <theholyduck>  its a value judgement
[18:26:56] <emmeka> lastonestanding but about the name of the continent... a lot of peoples here don't have this conception of land being something exclusive from sea in terms of territory
[18:26:57] <DunceCotus> well I am not presenting a conspiracy theory
[18:26:57] <theholyduck> clean and simple
[18:27:26] <DunceCotus> theholyduck its not a conspiracy that govts and corps do shady shit all the time
[18:27:32] <emmeka> lastonestanding like the Inuktitut term for their territories is "nunangat"
[18:27:41] <DunceCotus> for some reason when you include covid19 into this, people cry 'conspiracy theory'
[18:27:45] <DunceCotus> and seize up the conversation
[18:27:48] <emmeka> nunangat doesn't refer to just the land but also the ice and the waters
[18:28:03] <theholyduck> DunceCotus: because theres no proof? 
[18:28:15] <DunceCotus> and there won't be proof for some time
[18:28:28] <DunceCotus> until we have a citizens' investigation into it
[18:28:38] <theholyduck> DunceCotus: i imagine theres going to be all sorts of investigations
[18:28:39] <DunceCotus> or whistleblowers come forward etc
[18:28:41] <theholyduck> once t his shit is over
[18:28:43] <Duns_Scrotus> What‚Äôs a citizen‚Äôs investigation
