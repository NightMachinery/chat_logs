[20:39:09] <GaurishSharma[m]> Hello,... (full message at https://libera.ems.host/_matrix/media/r0/download/libera.chat/0dd28f15cf27b5b659391fda85349dfcb3329482)
[20:39:13] <GaurishSharma[m]> what I am missing?
[20:45:08] <headius> That is confusing 
[20:46:09] <headius>  Does it also fail in a normal IRB session?
[20:46:18] <GaurishSharma[m]> yes
[20:46:31] <GaurishSharma[m]> within rails
[20:46:55] <headius> I mean not rails console, just irb
[20:47:09] <GaurishSharma[m]> trying, give me 1min
[20:49:31] <headius> The last thing to try would be loading the script that works from within IRB
[20:50:24] <GaurishSharma[m]> works as IRB
[20:50:38] <GaurishSharma[m]> jruby-9.3.3.0 :003 > connection = java.sql.DriverManager.getConnection(ENV['SNOWFLAKE_DB_URL'])
[20:50:38] <GaurishSharma[m]>  => #<Java::NetSnowflakeClientJdbc::SnowflakeConnectionV1:0x2b1d1a5>
[20:51:11] <headius> Okay that's interesting, so it's something with the rails console messing up the JDBC driver load
[20:51:24] <headius> Is the path to the jar file correct? Pointing at the right file?
[20:51:26] <GaurishSharma[m]> yes. the same file I used in irb session just now
[20:51:55] <GaurishSharma[m]> the file also gets added to $CLASSPATH
[20:51:55] <GaurishSharma[m]> I am not sure what else to check
[20:56:38] <GaurishSharma[m]> here is the jar I am trying to load -> https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/net/snowflake/snowflake-jdbc/3.13.14/snowflake-jdbc-3.13.14.jar
[20:57:19] <GaurishSharma[m]> don't know much about java, so sorry if I am missing something silly. 
[21:32:34] <headius> Could you open a bug for this? I am not in the office and can't help very much today but others will see it
[21:33:21] <headius> They may not be a bug but it's a good way for us to figure out what's wrong
[21:47:46] <GaurishSharma[m]> done. https://github.com/jruby/jruby/issues/7169 Thank for taking time to respond! Have a great day
[21:53:08] <headius> Maybe kares  or enebo  have an idea
