[02:23:45] <epony> yes, that's one of the problems, people standing on both sides of progress and correctness
[02:25:10] <epony> there is no place for personal interpretations when technical and electrical (physics) systems are involved and you expect consistent results

[02:26:36] <epony> better learn the basics of how computers work first, you can't make progress in machine programming when you do not know the machine and its operation

[03:44:01] <Joanna> There have always been preconceived beliefs and agendas when it comes to science. There was a time when top scientific minds believed in spontaneous generation.. for example a leaf falls into water becomes a fish. There were also some very harsh penalties for anyone who disagreed with the consensus that the world was flat.
[03:46:38] <Joanna> There are basically 3 types of people. The majority copy or believe what they are told. A smaller number try to improve what already exists. A very very small minority invent something new.
[03:49:28] <Joanna> For innovation to happen you need to have a leisure affluent class of people with a lot of time on their hands which is facilitated by bountiful food production. There is no advanced civilization that didn’t come into being without cultivating grain or rice.
[03:55:10] <Joanna> In any case all technology no matter how benign gets used for warfare sooner or later.
