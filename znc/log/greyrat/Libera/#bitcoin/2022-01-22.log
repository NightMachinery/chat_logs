[07:21:57] <caveman> probably, eventually, we'll also have to trim abandoned wallets.  e.g. imagine if bitcoin was being used since, say, noah's time (he bought his ark's wood by bitcoin), then he probably lost his private key and BIP39 seed in the flood.  probably we can assume his wallet didn't exist.

[20:46:49] <JBritSteele> heh.. not specifically disagreeing, just not my goal currently
[20:47:07] <caveman> yeah.  was joking.
[20:47:20] <caveman> but personally i dislike trusting anyone with recovery.  i think it's too sensitive to trust a 3rd party.
[20:47:36] <caveman> i like that btc is trustless.  bringing a recovery agency in sort of triggers me.  i generally dislike it from a security point of view.

[20:48:40] <belcher> caveman id recommend not using core, at least directly, instead use a wallet which supports seed phrases
[20:48:44] <JBritSteele> caveman, I msged you, but not sure if I'm having a client issue
[20:48:53] <belcher> then the way to backup is to write down those 12 random words on paper, and thats your backup
[20:49:33] <belcher> theres a good resource here https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Storing_bitcoins
[20:49:44] <JBritSteele> I understand the thought if someone loses something they don't deserve to have it, but a nudge in the correct way can make things correct and also facilitate recovery
[20:52:22] <JBritSteele> a fee for the assistance would be part of this, also
[20:59:08] <belcher> such a service exists, called something like walletrecovery.org, though more competitors wont hurt
[20:59:32] <belcher> iv never used them myself, but you can see coins move on the blockchain so if they steal your coins they recover then it will be very visible

[21:07:36] <caveman> what's that, then?
[21:07:48] <belcher> the seed in core is just a big number, usually in hexadecimal
[21:07:51] <Earnestly> belcher: What do you think this script, which essentially does: > echo "secret word list" | bx mnemonic-to-seed | bx hd-new | bx hd-to-ec | bx ec-to-wif and uses the result as the sethdseed
[21:07:56] <belcher> not really appropriate for nontechnical people to write down
[21:08:13] <caveman> belcher: doesn't seem much bigger than a seed phrase.
[21:08:16] <Earnestly> In theory it should work, even if it's a long word list.  Recovery is a pretty extreme situation
[21:08:36] <Earnestly> I mean, in theoy should be possible to print base64'd file

[21:11:45] <belcher> caveman no, there's electrum wallet and then a few different implementations of electrum server
[21:12:12] <caveman> what's this in gentoo?  net-misc/electrum
[21:12:18] <Earnestly> belcher: No bitcoin core is quite useful.  electrum cli takes multiple seconds to complete each innvocation
[21:12:39] <belcher> caveman as money is involved, id recommend downloading it from electrum.org manually and verifying the pgp signatures
[21:13:01] <Earnestly> I think it's more to do with python's fairly notoriously slow init time (made worse with py3)
[21:13:01] <belcher> i can share here the pgp fingerprints of the electrum developers (not that its strong evidence but its better than nothing)
[21:13:23] <Earnestly> But it's the two I'd use, core and electrum, as you are
[21:13:51] <caveman> belcher: what if i use hdseeds in bitcoin-core.  suppose i can memorise that hex, and suppose no error correction is needed.  is there any difference between bitcoin-core's recovery with the hex HD seed, and that of electrum?
[21:14:08] <belcher> there probably are some small differences in details
[21:14:16] <belcher> but fundamentally its the same ideas
[21:14:18] <caveman> like?
[21:14:38] <caveman> so how does this seed recovery work with bitcoin-core?  i set the seed, then keep creating new wallets until i find some with money inside it?
[21:14:43] <belcher> electrum probably uses a different derivation path to core (which is a detail of how to convert the seed number into the keypairs)
[21:15:05] <belcher> you would have to be creating wallets for longer than the age of the universe until you found some money :p
[21:15:28] <caveman> i don't mean stealing others'.
[21:15:39] <Earnestly> Would you not scan the blockchain for spendable outputs?
[21:15:55] <Earnestly> I'm not sure how this works with HD wallets starting from custom seed
[21:15:56] <caveman> belcher: i mean, suppose that i had wallets with money in them, and that i lost them, except that i remember the HD seed.  then, how would my bitcoin-core recovery be like?
[21:16:03] <belcher> i dont know
[21:16:11] <belcher> i only use bitcoin core as a watch-only wallet, personally
[21:16:17] <Earnestly> I /assume/ that you'd scan the blockchain for any addresses which have spendable outputs via your master key
[21:16:31] <caveman> watch-only wallet?
[21:16:50] <belcher> a wallet that only watches addresses/public keys, but doesnt have private keys (so cant spend any money)
[21:17:08] <caveman> how do you watch things?
[21:17:09] <Earnestly> This is necessary for tracking funds with a cold wallet
[21:17:16] <Earnestly> You import the address
[21:17:32] <caveman> to track your own wallets, without spending them?
[21:17:53] <Earnestly> A cold wallet isn't connected to the internet, so there's no way to know how much it holds
[21:18:16] <Earnestly> A hot wallet is used to track the addresses it used, but without private keys (watchonly) so it cannot spend
[21:18:18] <BUSY> a hw wallet cannot know the blockchain status without a connection to the bitcoin network
[21:19:00] <Earnestly> You can import a pub key to sign transactions if you're making a payment from the cold wallet
[21:19:29] <Earnestly> caveman: Some old notes: https://0x0.st/oo9W.txt ( belcher can probably make sure these aren't silly)

[22:04:08] <Victorsueca> people not realizing that their private keys may have been derived from an hd seed that's not the latest
[22:05:43] <Earnestly> Victorsueca: The trick is that when it creates a new HD wallet (with random seed) it generates 1000 addresses.  If you use more than 1000 addresses it creates a new hdseed, the old hdseeds are kept as inactivehdseeds (multiple).  So in order to derive all addresses you'd have to sethdseed for each hdseed your wallet has.  I assume that rescanning the blockchain will find addresses which are
[22:05:45] <Earnestly> spendable according to your master private key?  I don't know

[22:36:04] <A_Dragon> (which they cant really do, without involving the ISP)
[22:36:39] <caveman> block others from reaching them.
[22:36:39] <A_Dragon> ISPs now in breach of contract for not providing the bare minimum promised service
[22:36:44] <A_Dragon> How?
[22:37:00] <caveman> block any packet going to destination ip found in list of peers of bitcoin
[22:37:12] <A_Dragon> so, people still cant use the internet?
[22:37:27] <A_Dragon> well yes, if you turn off, The Internet, you can stop bitcoin
[22:37:29] <caveman> they can.  just can't access the ip address that is functioning as a bitcoin peer
[22:37:33] <A_Dragon> p2p networks notwithstanding
[22:37:40] <A_Dragon> caveman: okay. Ill pick another, in a different country
[22:37:49] <A_Dragon> Ill use encryption or Tor
[22:38:15] <caveman> ok.
[22:38:23] <caveman> solved.  checkmate to gov.
[22:38:24] <A_Dragon> attack tor? cool. i2p
[22:38:36] <A_Dragon> attack i2p? Ill just use a proxy and talk to nodes outside the country
[22:38:48] <A_Dragon> encryption breaks most DPI methods
[22:38:55] <A_Dragon> because you have to break the encryption first
[22:39:25] <A_Dragon> Tor, especially using a node only accessable from a hidden service entirely breaks this
[22:39:33] <A_Dragon> and no, you cant just turn off tor either
[22:39:36] *** Quits: Fausto (~dante@gateway/tor-sasl/filohuhum) (Remote host closed the connection)
[22:39:41] <A_Dragon> its a self regulating network that constantly gains and loses nodes
[22:39:51] <A_Dragon> while those nodes are published, there are delays
[22:39:58] <A_Dragon> the amount of work required is comical
[22:39:58] <caveman> yes.  but they can force people to use tor bridges
[22:40:03] <A_Dragon> and?
[22:40:12] <A_Dragon> you dont have to go though an exit node
[22:40:17] <caveman> less users = price drop.
[22:40:20] <A_Dragon> just use a hidden service hosted bitcoin node
[22:40:26] <A_Dragon> cool, buy some more.
[22:40:29] <caveman> true (re hidden)
[22:40:36] <A_Dragon> 1 bitcoin == 1 bitcoin.

[22:41:20] <A_Dragon> (fungibility issues with bitcoin notwithstanding)
[22:41:32] <caveman> plus, there is too much money in btc for governments to destroy it.
[22:41:47] <A_Dragon> far easier to tax than to ban.
[22:41:58] <caveman> buy the bitcoin license.
[22:42:09] <A_Dragon> yeah no, you'd never manage that
[22:42:14] <A_Dragon> the tax already exists on capital gains.
[22:42:15] <Bakunin> itt's not easy to tax, but for countries like US, impossible to ban
[22:42:23] <Earnestly> Victorsueca: Oh something to keep in mind is that the seeds won't restore any imported private keys
[22:42:35] <caveman> Bakunin: why is it impossible to ban in u.s.a.?
[22:42:45] <A_Dragon> (one of) the only reason that governments *dont like* crypto is because its trivial to do money laundering with
[22:42:57] <A_Dragon> caveman: because it'd require too large a shift in the state to allow it
[22:43:04] <A_Dragon> you dont just push a button to ban this kind of thing
[22:43:05] <A_Dragon> you CANT
[22:43:18] <A_Dragon> it requires new software, new hardware, high speed packet monitoring
[22:43:21] <Victorsueca> caveman: IIRC last time a government tried to block Bitcoin the price actually rose, it was so easy to circumvent that it only served to prove the government's inability to completely block it. Also bitcoin doesn't depend on internet, it's perfectly possible to sync the blockchain and send transactions over satellite or radio.
[22:43:25] <A_Dragon> your original idea would require a HUGE server farm
[22:43:30] <A_Dragon> and even then
[22:43:33] <A_Dragon> trivial to get around
[22:43:45] <caveman> Victorsueca: interesting.  which incident was that?
[22:43:48] <Bakunin> allow me to rephrase:  it could be banned in name only, with zero enforcement
[22:44:43] *** Joins: ryu` (~ryusaku@user/ryu/x-3206151)
[22:45:24] <A_Dragon> caveman: even the GFW struggles to deal with btc and other protocols
[22:45:28] <A_Dragon> its geared towards HTTP
[22:45:48] <A_Dragon> and, the second you manage to actually outright disallow the protocol, given some magic
[22:45:51] <A_Dragon> we'll just pivot
[22:45:58] <A_Dragon> btc over http? sure
[22:46:02] <Earnestly> Keep in mind that just banning it in law, even if it's not enforcable, does create social dynamics that would likely see loss of adoption to some degree
[22:46:10] <A_Dragon> there are far too many ways to avoid bans
[22:46:11] <Earnestly> (As law determines culture)
[22:46:21] <A_Dragon> Earnestly: this is very true
[22:46:28] <A_Dragon> legally banning it stops companies from touching it
[22:47:27] <Victorsueca> caveman: I don't know the details, but doing a google or ddg search should easily bring up a bunch of cases

[22:53:10] <Victorsueca> caveman: the scenario i've seen the most usually involves a country with a dying economy, usually due to government missmanagement, people begin trying opt-out of that economy and escape, but suddenly the government decides that people should be responsible for reviving the economy or die trying, so they begin charging hefty fees for exchanging the currency and blocking any potential ways to escape that, which usually includes cryptocurrencies
[22:53:11] <Victorsueca> and any non-government method of sending international payments
[22:55:29] *** Joins: ferdna (~ferdna@user/ferdna)
[22:56:36] <Victorsueca> this usually deters a lot of people from using bitcoin, but at that point it's a matter of time that the whole thing becomes a life or death situation and people start caring less about those laws and more about surviving
[22:57:57] <tusko> perhaps in latin america
[22:58:57] <Victorsueca> yep, I think so
[22:59:30] <tusko> I'll move to Buenos Aires
[23:01:04] <Victorsueca> on a different kind of case, I think north korea also tried to ban bitcoin, several times, I heard (if someone could confirm that would be great) they ended up banning only mining, and I'm not sure if they're actually enforcing that
[23:02:02] <xlxlx> is bitcoin even bannable?
[23:02:08] <Bakunin> yes
[23:02:32] <Victorsueca> xlxlx: you can make it illegal, and that would surely deter most people from using it
[23:02:46] <caveman> plot twist:  kim jong-un is actually satoshi nakamato.
[23:02:47] <xlxlx> makes sense
[23:03:47] <Victorsueca> xlxlx: but from the practical standpoint, the whole thing is so open and adaptable that there's pretty much always a way to circumvent it being blocked
[23:04:11] <Victorsueca> as a government, your best hope would be to make it so impractical that no one bothers
[23:06:02] <caveman> by only monitoring network traffic and change on the blockchain (without checking delivery addresses), is it possible to find out which money was spent from which real ip address?
[23:06:10] <caveman> also suppose no tor.
[23:06:37] <xlxlx> Victorsueca: it'll be interesting to see what happens long-term because even if governments made it impractical, i feel that some people will always keep pushing for either 1) getting others to use it or 2) seeing more "black markets" in those countries
[23:07:31] <caveman> xlxlx: but will it hold the same value it holds nowadays?
[23:08:07] <xlxlx> caveman: probably not, even so look at altcoins like shiba basically valueless yet people still invest
