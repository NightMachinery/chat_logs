[13:45:34] <Walex2> Khepra: the Debian kernel team is pretty good at backporting newer stuff in the supported kernel.
[13:46:44] <Walex2> Khepra: alternatively kernels are one of the few cases where doing a bit of FrankenDebian works fine: using the Ubuntu HWE kernels, they are up to 5.13 currently.
[13:47:51] <Khepra> well at the moment, buster's 4.19 is vulnerable to a bunch of stuff. backported 5.10 did not get updates the bullseye's 5.10 did. last time the lag was almost a month for backported kernel. We already manage kernel.org's builds for some server arrays that require newer kernels, so I'll see with the team that we apply that to all the servers.
[13:48:21] <Walex2> Khepra: then I definitely recommend the Ubuntu HWE kernels for your situation.
[13:48:54] <Khepra> Walex2: the team is already planning full upgrade to Ubuntu this year, for all out Debian servers, so yeah.
[13:49:15] <Walex2> I think that they are better and better maintained than self-builds for
[13:49:39] <Walex2> I think that they are better and better maintained than self-builds from mainline. And they come with the usual Debian-style packaging, very convenient.
[13:49:56] <Khepra> if they track LTS kernels, yes. I am very suspicious of (any) small team maintaiing their own kernels that aren't supported upstream, but this is getting offtopic in #debian.
[13:50:33] <Walex2> Khepra: yes, they do track.
[13:50:37] <Khepra> Walex2: kernel.org has Makefile targets for .deb, that's why we're using that. it's dead easy to download, build, distribute to servers and apt install

[14:34:43] <Khepra> nah, 512M is okay now. 256 which methinks was default used to be too small, but this isn't installed by instller, it's debootstrap'ed.

[17:13:44] <Khepra> Harm133: randall: that makes absolutely no sense :) kernel upgrade isn't effective until reboot. ABI change (or lack of it) only affects DKMS rebuilds.
[17:14:42] <randall> Khepra: Complete guesswork on my side, but if none of the patched modules are loaded, maybe the upgrade will not set it.
[17:15:33] <Khepra> randall: the kernel cannot upgrade without reboot, unless you're using the "livepatch" API/service. modules may or may not be reloadable, usually aren't when userland is using them (eg, filesystems, gpus, hardware in use mostly can't reload live)

[21:13:19] <johnfg> Just finished the apt upgrade --without-new-pkgs.  Is there a reason to reboot before running apt full-upgrade?
[21:14:11] <johnfg> It does *not* say to reboot in the release notes, but there was a message or two in the update that mentioned rebooting.
[21:17:04] <jmcnaught> Do not reboot a partially upgraded system.
[21:18:40] <johnfg> jmcnaught: Right.  Doing the full-upgrade now.  Will let you know when done, then reboot and see you back here.
[21:19:41] <Khepra> karlpinc: yeah, but how does that relate to my problem.

[22:21:54] <johnfg> Cool!  Here in bullseye for the first time.
[22:24:35] <johnfg> There was a notification that there were updates to install.  I selected to Download (usually I just use apt update, and apt upgrade), but am getting these errors: Unable to download updates: and, The following packages have unmet dependencies:
