[00:00:27] <Simplar> I'll experiment with the URL however
[00:00:33] <Simplar> Thanks for good advice
[00:01:15] <systemfault> As you can see in your latest link, new URL throws an exception when the string is not a url
[00:01:27] <systemfault> So you can just catch the exception, do some extra checks..
[00:03:11] <systemfault> Now, your problem becomes... how do you differentiate a random string from another with the "v" extracted.
[00:04:19] <Simplar> I'll see into that

[01:34:14] <ljharb> OhTheCode__: that doesn't answer the question

[01:34:35] *** Joins: sed (~sed@pool-100-7-38-116.rcmdva.fios.verizon.net)
[01:34:46] <ljharb> so use modules and a bundler.
[01:35:42] <OhTheCode__> webpack bundles it up in an IIFE and it can't be reached by other parts of the code
[01:35:55] <ljharb> as it's supposed to. use modules.
[01:36:04] <ljharb> import or require the things you need from another file
[01:36:18] <ljharb> there shouldn't be any globals
[01:37:06] <OhTheCode__> lets say getting screeen size window.innerHeight was expensive to calculate, and i want to store it in a var, and winow resize needs to accesss it, how can i do that without maing window.innerHeight a global?
[01:37:57] *** Joins: comatory (~ondrejsyn@217.11.241.69)
[01:38:21] <austincheney> OhTheCode__, its not expensive and window.resize is an event, but I understand this is besides the point because its a rhetoric example
[01:38:23] <ljharb> OhTheCode__: i mean, `window` is already a global
[01:38:38] <ljharb> OhTheCode__: but in general, you do it by storing that state inside a module, and requiring that module in each file you want the information available
[01:38:51] <ljharb> ideally, you export a function that returns it, so other modules can't mutate it
[01:39:07] <austincheney> OhTheCode__, what I do is have a file dedicated to a settings object and then import it where I need to access it

[05:54:58] <austincheney> wroathe, thats for IPv4 because of NAT.  in IPv6 all addresses are global or link-local
[05:56:06] <Maxdamantus> Not necessarily. You can still do NAT on IPv6, it's just not as useful.
[05:56:38] <Maxdamantus> I wouldn't be surprised if it were used as some sort of default for sharing a network connection across VMs.
[05:57:17] <wroathe> I imagine a standard local ISP still wouldn't allocate multiple IPv6 addresses to devices on your home, and would just expect you to use a NAT instead
[05:57:39] <austincheney> the design of IPv6 renders NAT obsolete: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6#Stateless_address_autoconfiguration_(SLAAC)
[06:00:34] <Maxdamantus> Obsolete doesn't mean not used. Not familiar with IPv6 ISPs, but I can also imagine them simply providing a /128 address and calling it a day.
[06:00:56] <Maxdamantus> (with the expectation that the customer's router will just use NAT as it has always done)
[06:01:05] *** Joins: Intelo (~Intelo@88.244.90.6)
[06:01:17] <Maxdamantus> (I'm sure there are plenty of ISPs that do the right thing and provide a wider subnet)
[06:03:26] <austincheney> weird it seems there is NAT with IPv6, but its just for converting IPv4 addresses to IPv6 and it looks largely superficial
[06:04:24] <austincheney> if everybody were on IPv6 we wouldn't need TURN servers to achieve true peer-to-peer serverless
[06:04:43] <Maxdamantus> NAT isn't some externalised protocol. It's just something that you can do due to the way that IPv4 is designed. IPv6 doesn't change things such that NAT becomes impossible.
[06:04:47] *** Quits: sheetjs (~sheetjs@user/sheetjs) (Remote host closed the connection)
[06:05:22] <Maxdamantus> I suspect you can just configure NAT as usual for IPv6 on Linux using `iptables`.
[06:05:24] <wroathe> Or even necessarily undesirable. The vast majority of internet customers don't know that they're behind a NAT
[06:05:47] <Maxdamantus> Right. To some extent people probably rely on NAT for security.
[06:06:01] <austincheney> IPv6 changes things such that NAT becomes obsolete, such that the closest equivalent is spoofing or masking
[06:06:28] *** Joins: gggp (~textual@111.63.14.119)
[06:06:36] <wroathe> I haven't been following the deployment of IPv6 closely, but that wikipedia article says that in 2018 only 25.3% of 54,000 autonomous systems advertised Ipv6 networks in BGP
[06:06:44] <austincheney> most modern routers on IPv4 don't even use NAT though, they use PAT because its cheaper and supports more clients
[06:06:46] <wroathe> I'm surprised by that. I thought it'd be higher
[06:06:49] <Maxdamantus> The closest equivalent will still be called "NAT" or "masquerading" or whatever. There's no need for a new term for NAT on IPv6.
[06:07:13] <Maxdamantus> https://mirrors.bieringer.de/Linux+IPv6-HOWTO/nat-netfilter6..html
[06:08:00] <Maxdamantus> That's how to do NAT on IPv6 in Linux. Works the same way as IPv4.
[06:08:00] <austincheney> there is need for a new term because its functionally different.  The whole point of NAT was to provide a single public address to represent a slew of internal devices.  with IPv6 its a one for one exchange with no numerical benefit
[06:08:48] <Maxdamantus> It's not functionally different. It's just a matter of practicality.
[06:09:21] <Maxdamantus> If a company owns a wide subnet of public IPv4 addresses, they can allocate each computer on the network a public IPv4 address.
[06:09:45] <Maxdamantus> eg, Google owns at least one /8 subnet. They could practically do that.
[06:10:00] <austincheney> if they want to spend shit tons of money, there aren't any more public ipv4 addresses in north america
[06:10:01] <Maxdamantus> I don't know if they do.
[06:10:18] <Maxdamantus> Google already owns those addresses. They don't need to spend any more money.
[06:11:00] <Maxdamantus> They could designate their most favourite 16777216 employees and give them each their own IPv4 address.
[06:11:03] <austincheney> you don't need to be google to have a public ipv6 address
[06:11:09] <Maxdamantus> Dunno if they even have that many employees.

[21:26:40] <cantelope> threejs, probably, just because i've used it

[21:27:00] <cantelope> i prefer to build custom
[21:28:33] <cantelope> also, shaders/GPU graphics are potentially fast & visually stunning, but like so many movies of late, pointless and the impetus via being largely prefabricated for mediocrity

[22:00:13] <C0nundrum> Hello
[22:01:09] <C0nundrum> Is there a special way to get nested objects from a error object ?
[22:01:32] <C0nundrum> when i try to reference it normally, it comes up as undefined, but i see it when i console.log it
[22:02:23] <KevinX> what if you JSON.stringify it when you console it?
[22:03:50] <C0nundrum> I tried that both of the whole object and the stack
[22:03:59] <C0nundrum> there are fields missing in the outputed object

[22:06:38] <KevinX> objects in the console can change by the time you expand them, so using stringify will unpack it so you can see it in it's state, or do something else to clone the object youre sending to the console

[22:35:22] <KevinX> I think you can't catch errors like that. You either need try/catch or use the .then()/.catch() pattern
[22:36:33] <C0nundrum> Right but what i more interested in is the underlying concept. Why am i unable to access the field, but console.log is able to ?
[22:37:23] <KevinX> You shared only a fraction of the code, so no clue
[22:38:44] <KevinX> Are you doing console.log(data) on the very next line?
[22:38:49] <C0nundrum> What do you mean... the issue is the resposne from the axios request
[22:39:47] <C0nundrum> I edited the gist with more detailed code
[22:39:55] <KevinX> probably easier if you just set it up on codepen or somewhere and someone can fix it for you. I have to run actually. sister is coming over soon
[22:40:49] <KevinX> You can't combine await and .catch() I don't think.
[22:41:21] <KevinX> Remove const { data } = await  and try
