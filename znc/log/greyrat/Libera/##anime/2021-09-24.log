[00:00:58] <Cryowolf> lots of people getting sick but the amount getting seriously sick is declining rapidly
[00:01:08] <Cryowolf> for most its a regular cold
[00:01:10] <Cryowolf> then its over
[00:01:19] <Cryowolf> and yes they can get it even if vaccinated
[00:01:34] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Cryowolf: What's the vaccination rate for Sweden as is it increasing about as fast as the decrease in serious cases occurs?
[00:02:30] <Cryowolf> 2 dose vaccination rate is 75%
[00:02:41] <Cryowolf> 1 dose is 83%
[00:02:47] <Cryowolf> that is minimum 1
[00:02:57] <Aurora_v_kosmose> That's probably helping quite a bit.
[00:03:32] <Cryowolf> sure and our economy isn't as fucked cause things kept operating more or less, even if restricted
[00:04:11] <Cryowolf> and the extermination of a virus with a low mortality rate and high infection rate is next to impossible

[00:05:04] <Cryowolf> it'll join the rest of the corona viruses as a cold virus

[00:05:48] <HeTo> right, well, sure, but those are a sign of failure (unless doing it like Australia and NZ were doing them, to get the case numbers down to 0)
[00:06:10] <Cryowolf> Australia didn't get 0
[00:06:12] *** Joins: solaraquarion (~solaraqua@pool-141-157-225-211.nycmny.fios.verizon.net)
[00:06:20] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Parts of it have.
[00:06:41] <Cryowolf> and I doubt NZ did either, just that most who aren't sick enough aren't gonna bother reporting it
[00:07:18] <Cryowolf> and you gotta use some pretty strong authoritarian measures to create a complete lockdown
[00:07:31] <Cryowolf> something I'm against
[00:07:36] *** Joins: Miyukii (~Miyukii@user/miyukii)
[00:07:42] <HeTo> it would've spread in NZ and been noticed if it hadn't been 0
[00:08:09] <HeTo> which is better, a stricter lockdown for a few weeks or lighter but still serious restrictions for years?
[00:08:27] <Cryowolf> a few weeks isn't gonna be enough
[00:08:41] <HeTo> it was in NZ and Australia before delta
[00:09:00] <HeTo> a few weeks a couple times
[00:09:12] <Cryowolf> Sweden has eased up on most covid restrictions that aren't in hospitals or clinics
[00:09:33] <Cryowolf> and number restrictions based on size of venue
[00:10:22] <Cryowolf> You can't get every country in the world to lock down 'for a few weeks' and have every single person obey
[00:10:32] <Cryowolf> it's not realistic
[00:12:57] <HeTo> now back to Sweden... within the fuckup that the European response to covid was, Nordic countries for the most part did very well... but Sweden did much worse than other Nordic countries. the worst hit for the economy, although not by a large margin, and a death rate many times that of other Nordic countries
[00:13:27] <Cryowolf> death rate was due to failure in the elderly care system
[00:13:40] <HeTo> it was to keep the hospitals from overflowing
[00:14:01] <HeTo> and you can't fully isolate them from the rest of the society if that's what you were going for
[00:14:04] <Cryowolf> no, it was a failure in policy and preparation
[00:14:20] <Cryowolf> theyve even gone on record with that

[00:15:14] <Cryowolf> they werent prepared, they didn't have a plan to protect the elderly and there were no policies in place to make sure the sick don't go to work
[00:15:30] <Cryowolf> there was nothing to isolate and keep things extra hygenic
[00:15:41] <Cryowolf> they didn't impose visitation limitation
[00:15:45] <HeTo> they need to eat, they need their laundry done, their accommodation needs maintenance, when you're talking about something that lasts years they need to meet family
[00:15:48] <Cryowolf> or restrictions
[00:16:23] <Cryowolf> and yet Denmark that had lower rates didnt allow for visitation
[00:16:27] <Cryowolf> even by family
[00:16:40] <Bco1981> 384mb ram isn't enough to run the raspbian live... and the install couldn't read the dvd when it finally was about to install in low memory mode.
[00:16:45] <Cryowolf> eventually Sweden didn't either
[00:17:06] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Bco1981: Raspbian. Have you tried Debian?
[00:17:07] <Cryowolf> but please don't talk to me as if you were here, unless you actually were
[00:17:21] <Bco1981> Aurora_v_kosmose: it's basically the same thing.
[00:17:31] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Bco1981: And the installer itself might be too fat, in which case bootstrapping on the storage device directly might be your only option.
[00:18:01] <Bco1981> it failed the dvd-rom integrity test too
[00:18:09] <Aurora_v_kosmose> That's weird
[00:18:18] <Bco1981> old drive, old discs
[00:20:14] <Cryowolf> Right now though things are working smooth, we've got public transportation, we have clinics and stores open, pharmacies. Elderly homes  are open to visitation again. Cinemas and other entertainment locations are open again. Restaurants have had restrictions lifted and so have bars. The number of people that can be in acertain area at the same time has gone up. Most people getting sick barely get more than the sniffles. Several covid 
[00:20:14] <Cryowolf> wards they had to create and move or eject other patients from are now back to being for what they used to be for
[00:20:25] <Cryowolf> and food doesn't cost more

[11:42:26] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: it was in "cool down mode"for a long time
[11:42:37] <DunceCotus> The most immediate of Titor's predictions were of an upcoming civil war in the United States having to do with "order and rights". He described it as beginning in 2005,[8] with civil unrest surrounding the presidential election of that year. This civil conflict that he characterized as "having a Waco type event every month that steadily gets worse"[8] would be "pretty much at everyone's doorstep" and erupt by 2008.
[11:42:37] <DunceCotus> As a result of the war, the United States would split into five regions based on various factors and differing military objectives. This civil war, according to Titor, would end in 2015 with a brief but intense World War III.
[11:43:42] <Shinra> I think Jon Titor was a real time traveller
[11:43:43] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: yes, and as a result we haven't had new Mandelas since approx 2013
[11:43:50] <Shinra> and that it's only thanks to him that we avoided all that
[11:44:34] <DunceCotus> Shinra: we may have avoided that, but what we have now doesn't bode well either
[11:44:45] <DunceCotus> US may still have their civil war 2.0

[16:56:37] <ButterNoodle> oh.. 
[16:56:43] <Bco1981> i guess it is it's time...
[16:56:47] <ButterNoodle> idk how to troubleshoot new pc's running windows
[16:56:58] <ButterNoodle> except by replacing them
[16:57:40] <Bco1981> it might just be a disk that is the problem, that is draggin down everything on this pc

[18:06:46] <DaPinkOne> gotta practice reading faster chats, or skip lines if they're not the thread you're interested in
[18:07:06] <analoq> i've never seen irc go too fast for reading :P
[18:07:16] <amigojapan> DaPinkOne: yeah. I just skip. I am a slow reader
[18:07:37] <analoq> i mean twitch chat is fast
[18:07:44] <DaPinkOne> analoq, I have, but it's usually during very busy/large channels, or when some real shit is going down
[18:08:00] <analoq> ive been on irc for 10+ years
[18:08:20] <DaPinkOne> there were a lot of fast channels when freenode was tanking
[18:08:20] <analoq> ive never seen a channel that went faster than i can read
[18:08:26] <amigojapan> analoq: maybe you read fast
[18:08:54] <DaPinkOne> the FOSS channel was way too fast for me to read, or even the mods. they said they were gonna comb over the logs after the fact, 'cause they knew it would be too much
[18:09:24] <analoq> hm. i wasnt active when it happened
[18:09:38] <analoq> but i can imagine. freenode finally had something to talk about xD
[18:10:04] <DaPinkOne> there's a few channels that do bridging, and that can get pretty intense too
[18:10:28] <DaPinkOne> I'm not 100% that counts as IRC though
[18:11:02] <amigojapan> darkwitch: my guess is you will make fragrances
[18:11:23] <analoq> not really imho. if i pool enough channels into one it will always get too fast

[18:11:35] <DaPinkOne> amigojapan, any wholesome shows on this season? I've fallen behind quite a bit I think
[18:12:02] <amigojapan> DaPinkOne: sorry. I have not watched anything current
[18:12:08] <analoq> DaPinkOne: dragonmaid s2. and the slime anime should classify as 'wholesome'
[18:12:26] <Poeticode> I'd recommend Fena: the Pirate Princess
[18:12:43] <darkwitch> slimes don't act like slime
[18:12:53] <Poeticode> and second season of To Your Eternity was lit as expected
[18:13:03] <DaPinkOne> I didn't know dragonmaid s2 was going already. I've been keeping up with slime, 'cause I read the LN back in the day. I'm not disappointed. I'm looking forward to the fairy's future.
[18:13:09] <darkwitch> they are more like balls of jelly
[18:13:25] <amigojapan> darkwitch: there is also a Japanese toy gel called slime
[18:13:32] <analoq> yey i recommended the right stuff :D
[18:13:50] <Poeticode> The Case Study of Vanitas is also real good
[18:14:13] <DaPinkOne> I'll give vanitas a shot then

[18:14:28] *** Quits: Kratos (~Kratos@user/abrax) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[18:14:59] <analoq> true otherwise it would be jelly 
[18:15:10] <DaPinkOne> darkwitch, slime could be anywhere from a glicerine emulsion, to water + cornstarch
[18:15:11] <Poeticode> slime's last two eps made the whole snorefest of the season worth it

[18:22:59] <amigojapan> Yup
[18:23:31] <DaPinkOne> there might be a "slime" in a rogue-like, but as they're scarce on graphical representation, it's not really the same

[18:35:24] <DaPinkOne> if you can ssh in and rename just fine, you might be able to mount with sshfs and use linux
[18:35:27] <analoq> the reason they block it is probably because windows doesnt allow the difference as windows is case insensitive. well it's not really but it still enforces it

[18:36:47] <DaPinkOne> i wish windows was case sensitive, and didn't have stupid file restrictions. IIRC they still have that dumb 128 character fullpath length issue that's been around since forever
[18:37:07] <analoq> the issue is when you backup stuff automated from linux to a synology nas things will mess up when your source contains 'file.txt and File.txt'
[18:37:29] <DaPinkOne> analoq, ah, I can see that being a problem.

[18:44:43] <DaPinkOne> oysters or similar may also fit the bill
[18:45:09] <DaPinkOne> though I personally don't consider them food until cooked, not everybody agrees.
[18:45:13] <wikifurry-76> Im lazy atm, someone Google it for me? 
[18:45:13] <darkwitch> yes, I want something more like natto and snails and oysters and thick lube without the taste and bad smell
[18:47:24] <DaPinkOne> darkwitch, you can pick up great white beans in a can. I think they're the same kind of beans as natto, but they're not fermented, so they don't have the smell or weird taste
[18:47:34] <DaPinkOne> not quite as slimy though, I guess
[18:47:56] <analoq> true white beans are pretty slimy
[18:48:10] <analoq> well not the beans themselves but the 'sauce' thats in the can
[18:48:13] <darkwitch> what's slimy about white beans? nothing, I'd say
[18:48:28] <DaPinkOne> ah, natto is soybeans. I'm thinking of Great Northern Beans
[18:49:29] <DaPinkOne> darkwitch, I dunno man. most foods get slimy through some kind of fermentation or solid-ish fats. I'm not sure what you're lookin for here
[18:50:01] <darkwitch> I mean, jellyfish is good, but once it dries out, no more squishy
[18:50:29] <darkwitch> I think that comes from mucin
[18:51:39] <darkwitch> Mucins are a family of high molecular weight, heavily glycosylated proteins (glycoconjugates) produced by epithelial tissues in most animals. Mucins' key characteristic is their ability to form gels; therefore they are a key component in most gel-like secretions, serving functions from lubrication to cell signalling to forming chemical barriers.

[19:10:52] <DaPinkOne> ButterNoodle, there's not much to be done about it. you can toss a lid on to keep the splash down, but the corrosion still kills the pumps, filters, etc, and maintaining salt/KH/PH/etc is more of a bitch than a freshwater tank
[19:11:05] <ButterNoodle> hmm

[19:18:38] <ButterNoodle> electrical outlets have electrical potential. the salt in the air increases conductivity around the conductors. free ions will collect salt inside on the conductive surfaces of the electrical outlet. and eventually it will build up enough to short out the inside of the electrical outlet
[19:18:47] <ButterNoodle> kinda like peeing on an electrical fence
[19:19:04] <ButterNoodle> cause u got conductive stuff in ur piss
[19:19:13] <ButterNoodle> anyway
[19:19:39] <ButterNoodle> when I was an amateur I bubbles up some paneling on the wall bc of spray
[19:19:44] <DaPinkOne> that makes sense. sure. you'd want to minimize splashing and/or amount of salt that can get into the air/out of the tank
[19:20:16] <ButterNoodle> its not terrible.. but its definitely more destructive than fresh water
[19:20:19] <DaPinkOne> we've got lids on all our tanks to avoid splash, and avoid moisture loss, 'cause it's dry as fuck in here
[19:20:59] <ButterNoodle> a friend that has been doing salt for 30 years, and the top layer of his basement floor is crumbling from salt
[19:21:12] <DaPinkOne> the lids aren't as good as they could be, but it's a lot better than it was without. we were concerned about shorting out our lights we had so much splashage
[19:21:12] <ButterNoodle> a good sealer can prevent that
[19:22:04] <DaPinkOne> I imagine salt spray on any sort of floor over that period would be pretty bad
[19:22:09] <ButterNoodle> on a reef tank.. where u running an obscene amount of lights and pumps... keeping spray to a minimum is important for longevity of equipment and safety
[19:22:35] <ButterNoodle> with chinese led's I run a lot less light

[22:16:24] <Bco1981> yeah
[22:16:36] <Bco1981> actually it hit her fase first i think
[22:16:40] <Bco1981> face*
[22:16:59] <ButterNoodle> I flinched when I seen her limp wrist the 9mm and the casings were coming back at her
[22:17:28] <ButterNoodle> 3 girls.. wife included.. have got a hot casing down the shirt from limp wristing
[22:17:34] <Bco1981> it just misses her nose and lips
[22:18:19] <ButterNoodle> hit the fucking dirt when that happens... u risk getting shot

[22:22:54] <ButterNoodle> I mean I dont limp wrist it..
[22:23:05] <ButterNoodle> but proper clothing is needed
[22:24:22] <ButterNoodle> polymer framed pistols are notorious for that issue since there is little mass in the frame for the forces of the action to push against.
[22:24:59] <ButterNoodle> I'm not one for a good comparison.. because my wrist strength is supreme from years of.... well fapping

[22:53:29] <MootPoot> TRIM
[22:53:50] <Aurora_v_kosmose> That's not exactly what that means.
[22:54:03] <Aurora_v_kosmose> DM-SMR can have TRIM and should.
[22:54:29] <MootPoot> it should, but in that case shouldn't TRIM be handled only by the drive
[22:54:29] <Aurora_v_kosmose> HA-SMR & HM-SMR are a different thing.
[22:54:34] <MootPoot> and kept blind from the OS 
[22:54:42] <MootPoot> so it TRIM's when it wants
[22:54:49] <Aurora_v_kosmose> MootPoot: No, because TRIM must be exposed to the OS to work at all
[22:54:59] <MootPoot> oh

[23:40:59] <MootPoot> my asshole is spicy
[23:41:05] <Cryowolf> Im unsure of what black fiber is
[23:41:07] <ButterNoodle> u eat curry today MootPoot 
[23:41:09] <Cryowolf> do you know ButterNoodle?
[23:41:09] <Aurora_v_kosmose> But they'd need to update their neighborhood and station switching boxes, which would be practically more expensive than switching to fiber entirely

[23:41:20] <Cryowolf> thats what they call what theyre upgrading to
[23:41:24] <MootPoot> ButterNoodle:  indian curry isen't enough to make my asshole spicy
[23:41:28] <ButterNoodle> *dark fiber is just strands of fiber to be used for whatever
[23:41:29] <Aurora_v_kosmose> So ISPs act like idiots instead
[23:41:53] <Cryowolf> ButterNoodle, why has it made everything faster then?
[23:42:02] <ButterNoodle> they can provision it today for whatever vdsl, and later they can do ethernet
[23:42:04] <Cryowolf> or maybe its the information load thats higher
[23:42:16] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Cryowolf: You didn't read the part where he said it increases bandwidth?
[23:42:29] <ButterNoodle> Aurora_v_kosmose: what is the question
[23:42:44] <Cryowolf> Aurora_v_kosmose, he didn't say that about black/dark fiber, he said that about copper
[23:42:50] *** Quits: luke-jr (~luke-jr@user/luke-jr) (Quit: ZNC - http://znc.sourceforge.net)
[23:43:00] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Cryowolf: He was talking about the multiple strands of tightly packed fiber.
[23:43:08] <ButterNoodle> its applicable on any medium.. also latency is a component of attainable speeds
[23:43:09] <dfch> Just take the sinovac shot and enjoy your 5g signal boost for free
[23:43:09] <Aurora_v_kosmose> We've got two concurrent conversations.
[23:43:14] *** Joins: luke-jr (~luke-jr@user/luke-jr)
[23:43:16] <ButterNoodle> more than 2
[23:43:16] <Aurora_v_kosmose> dfch: Meh, 5g is slow
[23:43:24] <MootPoot> multithreaded communication
[23:43:47] <Cryowolf> Aurora_v_kosmose, I know, but Ive brought up black fiber earlier when we got into talking about 10gbps etc and how theyre using black/dark fiber to beta test it
[23:43:52] <Cryowolf> but I dont understand what it is
[23:44:03] <ButterNoodle> idk if u can 100g over copper.. you probably can.. infiniband? didnt they have some
[23:44:04] <dfch> Aurora_v_kosmose, imagine commenting on "chinese vaccine boosts 5g signal" unironically  :p
[23:44:13] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Cryowolf: If ButterNoodle is right, it's just more fiber strands in the cable allowing for more parallel bandwidth.
[23:44:39] <Aurora_v_kosmose> (And higher quality certification standards)
[23:44:41] <dfch> sumimasen, I'll see myself out
[23:44:47] * Aurora_v_kosmose pats dfch
[23:44:49] <ButterNoodle> I mean it depends on the tech.. at some point its easier to provision it as an ethernet product over dark single mode fiber
[23:45:08] * dfch checks the access.log where the pat came from
[23:45:09] <Cryowolf> Aurora_v_kosmose, I was the one who said that about thinner fibers being packed more tightly
[23:45:13] <dfch> eh another tor node... k
[23:45:20] <dfch> :D
[23:45:27] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Cryowolf: Ah my bad
[23:45:34] <ButterNoodle> typically ur only gonna get a single strand or pair to a house
[23:45:41] <Aurora_v_kosmose> dfch: Always Tor. Well, until something better comes around
[23:46:30] <Cryowolf> There's freenet
[23:46:32] <ButterNoodle> when we can shoot 100g over single mode pairs, the optics are cheaper than the infrastructure to go faster
[23:46:38] <Cryowolf> even if it isnt as good or safe
[23:46:48] <MootPoot> idfk what's wrong with my computer
[23:46:59] <MootPoot> starting up a game instantly crashes video
[23:47:08] <MootPoot> the only recent change I made was installing that new hdd
[23:47:13] <MootPoot> maybe I bonked a cable
[23:48:12] <Cryowolf> or too much power going through a single cord
[23:48:15] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Cryowolf: Yeah, Freenet has some major design flaws that aren't getting fixed without a rearchitecturing. Instead they just doubled down on saying pubnet mode is unsafe
[23:48:37] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Which well, fair. That's a legit answer, though it's a bit lazy.
[23:53:05] <MootPoot> restart seems to have fixed
[23:53:16] <MootPoot> I think it was multiple GPU-related driver updates
[23:53:20] <MootPoot> without a restart
[23:54:00] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Not sure if on Linux, but on Linux programs don't automagically reload their dynamic libraries if they're updated.
[23:54:34] <MootPoot> win10
[23:54:46] <Aurora_v_kosmose> If any of those loaded anything dynamically, or tried to load something that no longer exists, weirdness occurs.
[23:54:54] <Aurora_v_kosmose> At least, if they don't have properly fallback code
[23:55:32] *** Quits: snake (~snake@user/snake) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[23:56:22] <Cryowolf> with tor  I can at least route vpn > tor > vpn > tor
