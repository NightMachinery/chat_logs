[00:08:28] <Nobrem> Happy new year!
[00:08:52] <Nobrem> I am just trying to make a needlessly long process way shorter... but I need help, please
[00:09:19] <Nobrem> So, I have some time lapse videos.   Time lapse videos are sped up videos.  In my case,  4x,  10x or 15x faster than normal.
[00:09:38] <Nobrem> So, if the video is 15x faster than normal,  1 second in the video would be 15 real life seconds.

[00:10:40] <Nobrem> At the moment, I am heavily making use of "ffmpeg"
[00:10:47] <Nobrem> at first, I split the video into 4 min chunks
[00:11:00] <Nobrem> why 4 minutes?  Because 4 minutes = 1 hour in real life
[00:11:21] <Nobrem> then I add a text to the video (also using ffmpeg) saying  "1st hour",  "2nd hour", and so on
[00:11:31] <Nobrem> and then I merge them back into a full length version
[00:11:55] <Nobrem> Why do I split the videos?  Because I couldn't find a simpler way to only add text to certain parts of the video
[00:12:09] *** Quits: justsomeguy (~justsomeg@user/justsomeguy) (Quit: WeeChat 3.3)
[00:12:09] <Nobrem> that's why I split them into 4 minute chunks,  add the text, and then concatenate all parts again

[00:59:37] <Nobrem> wow
[01:00:11] <Nobrem> thank you so much, e36freak
[01:00:35] <Nobrem> e36freak, have you read the whole problem above, and have you seen my paste?
[01:00:42] <earnestly> e36freak: (IBM)
[01:00:50] <Nobrem> e36freak, https://dpaste.org/dcD4#L
[01:00:53] <e36freak> not really, i just saw the "convert HH:MM:SS to seconds" bit
[01:01:09] <Nobrem> e36freak, I am combining a couple of time-lapse videos, all sped up to 15x
[01:01:13] *** Quits: xx (~xx@user/xx) (Quit: xx)
[01:01:24] <Nobrem> currently, I am adding an "hour-text" to every single one of them _before_ combining
[01:01:25] *** Joins: xx (~xx@user/xx)
[01:01:29] <Nobrem> so 2 hours * 4-5 camera angles
[01:01:40] <Nobrem> however, the real videos will be way shorter, so I can save time
[01:01:58] <Nobrem> the idea is,  to cut out a small piece,  e.g.  from 00:05:12 - 00:12:32  and give it the right hour-text
[01:02:16] <Nobrem> my current approach in pseudo-code is:   https://dpaste.org/dcD4
[01:02:30] <e36freak> if you're doing a shit ton of those conversions it could be done a bit more efficiently, <<< isn't the most efficient thing
[01:02:51] <e36freak> if it's like <100 that's good enough, and it's definitely not your bottleneck if ffmpeg is involved
[01:02:59] <Nobrem> I have no money to pay for help, but could you still help me with some code, please?
[01:03:19] <e36freak> i'm on/off the computer right now, trying to put a honda back together
[01:03:40] <Nobrem> oh, lovely :)  I wish you all the best with your car!
[01:03:45] <e36freak> not mine, but thanks
[01:03:59] <Nobrem> even nicer if you're doing it for somebody else :)
[01:04:07] <e36freak> (it's my job)
[01:04:21] <bertieb_> Nobrem: have you tried a loop approach?
[01:04:38] <e36freak> converting from seconds back to HH:MM:SS is also pretty trivial
[01:04:40] <Nobrem> e36freak, you just left me speechless.  You are good in bash scripting, but repair cars for a living?!
[01:04:53] <Nobrem> e36freak, that sounds like an interesting life story
[01:04:54] <e36freak> Nobrem: i mostly do performance work on bmws, but yeah i can code
[01:05:16] <Nobrem> bertieb_, if I could do it, I would..  I am totally stuck
[01:05:26] <Nobrem> I will probably do it in PHP and run in in the command line
[01:05:38] <Nobrem> I cannot get it to work as a shell script
[01:05:53] <Nobrem> or let me write pseudo code.... brb - 5 min

[01:17:21] <Nobrem> Hello?
[01:18:43] <bertieb_> still here
[01:19:14] <bertieb_> keep the beginning offset
[01:19:30] <Nobrem> bertieb_, let us say, we disregard the first 130 seconds
[01:19:37] <bertieb_> and calculate start time each time thru the loop
[01:19:46] <Nobrem> and we want to cut a piece that is from second 130 - 780
[01:19:49] <bertieb_> then all you have to do is successively add 240 to the start time
[01:19:53] *** Joins: lsrtl__ (~lsrtl@user/lsrtl)
[01:19:55] <Nobrem> that would be:
[01:19:59] <Nobrem> 130 - 240 = hour 1
[01:20:08] <Nobrem> 240 - 480 = hour 2
[01:20:20] <Nobrem> 480 - 700 = hour 3

[01:20:36] <bertieb_> oh I see
[01:20:38] <Nobrem> but then I would need to split it all again

[01:20:53] <Nobrem> maybe they have a out-of-the-box solution
[01:21:08] <bertieb_> so your 'hour' corresponds to the footage

[01:21:16] <bertieb_> *to
[01:21:39] <Nobrem> yes

[04:59:27] <phogg> you can't
[04:59:38] <phogg> but maybe case fallthrough can help sometimes
[04:59:47] <wiscii> if you stagger your case and you get it wrong it will be hell to pay
[04:59:49] <earnestly> | is all you have, and it is explicit which is nice.  That and inverting the match logic
[05:00:05] <earnestly> What is a staggered case?
[05:00:57] <tm512> like all of the commands that I want this case to match are suffixed by -all, but I only want to match start-all, stop-all, and restart all, then in the case I'm gonna shear off the -all and recurse into the script with that command and each argument from a list
[05:01:17] <tm512> could probably pastebin in just a bit but I'm trying to get this loop implemented
[05:03:06] <earnestly> tm512: Do what you first did, start-all|stop-all|restart-all) this is fine
[05:03:23] <earnestly> Don't worry about repeating text, your text editor can handle changes to that
[05:03:28] <tm512> but in this instance it's really not an issue to use start-all|stop-all|restart-all) though, if I had like 10 different commands, I'd just use a wildcard and try to detect errors coming out of the script instances that I recurse into

[11:40:41] <emanuele6> i don't get what "enclosed with double quotes" has to do with this.
[11:41:56] <emanuele6> if you want to add a value as the new $3, you can just use:  set -- "${@:1:2}" "$new_val" "${@:3}"
[11:43:02] <Delf> It's messing up space between the arguments
[11:43:30] <emanuele6> what does that mean?
[11:43:59] <Delf> There are multiple arguments, not just one. Some are enclosed with "" because they have spaces in them
[11:44:23] <lopid> you're not quoting them when you use them?
[11:44:56] <emanuele6> what you are saying does not make much sense. you are probably not expanding your variables correctly.
[11:45:02] <Delf> I am, but I'm using FinalArgument+="${i}" which just adds all the separate arguments into one
[11:45:22] <Delf> emanuele6: Most likely
[11:45:35] <lopid> +=("$i")
[11:45:39] <emanuele6> well, i can't tell what is wrong, if you don't describe what is wrong correctly.

[11:49:04] <greybot> An array maps numbers to strings. Bash 4 also has associative arrays (maps strings to strings). http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashSheet#Arrays http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/005 http://wiki.bash-hackers.org/syntax/arrays

[11:51:06] <emanuele6>  "${@:1:2}"  only passes 2 values starting from 1 ($1), so $1 and $2 (it passes nothing if $1 is not set; it only passes $1, if $2 is not set)
[11:51:18] <emanuele6> then "$new_val" passes the new value
[11:51:46] <emanuele6> and "${@:3}" passes the rest of the arguments from $3 onwards (or nothing if $3 is not set)
[11:51:59] <Delf> The complexity broke my brains. I need to re-read that a few times
[11:52:20] <emanuele6> well, setting the positional arguments is what you asked.

[22:54:18] <emanuele6> you have an extra backslash in `grep "21.12.24\|21.12.23\"' (after the second `"'); that makes the string not closed, so bash is probably waiting for you to close the string
[22:54:20] <han-solo> the `grep "foo bar\"` gives me that
[22:55:47] <emanuele6> remove the backslash and it will work;   "without part "> /run/user/1000/Tag_Selektiv_Strom.pwr" it works fine." is probably incorrect, you likely didn't have the extra \ when you tried without the redirection
[22:55:56] <dreamon> emanuele6, Your right! Thank you!! that did it

[22:57:50] <dreamon> Thank you all. and happy new year!

[22:58:05] <emanuele6> yes, i was about to send that
[22:59:30] <geirha> it expands to  grep -F -e21.12.23 -e21.12.24 ...
[23:00:05] <geirha> (assuming I didn't typo 24 earlier)

[23:02:36] <dreamon> geirha, I create bash command out of python, cause python its to slow.
[23:03:11] <dreamon> there was a command to measure speed
[23:03:50] <han-solo> and bash is faster ? :)
[23:04:44] <dreamon> han-solo, I have read about. now wanted to find out.
[23:04:56] <e36freak> i... what
[23:05:04] <e36freak> "python is too slow so i used bash" ?
[23:05:53] <e36freak> *grep* may be fast, but grep is written in C
[23:06:09] <emanuele6> bash is also written in C :D
[23:06:23] <emanuele6> well,  bison+C
[23:06:35] <e36freak> bit different from a single purpose program
[23:06:41] *** Joins: The_Jag (~The_Jag@host-79-33-196-10.retail.telecomitalia.it)
[23:08:02] <geirha> so grep being a bit faster than python at what grep was designed to do, I can see, but why involve bash?
[23:09:23] <e36freak> well, and cpython for that matter
[23:09:32] <dreamon> In python I use  "for line in fileObj: if re.search(one_pattern,line):"  maybe this is slowing down.
[23:10:06] <e36freak> do you even actually need a regex?
[23:10:12] <e36freak> you may find that a fixed string search is much faster
[23:11:41] <dreamon> my selection is comming from a html multiple selection.. pattern list could be up to 30 patterns.
[23:12:04] <e36freak> and you're cramming them all in a single regex?
[23:12:16] <dreamon> pattern ar in the first 8byte of line.
[23:12:38] <e36freak> so then just checking that would probably also be considerably faster
[23:12:42] <dreamon> no list of patterns.
[23:12:52] *** Quits: treble (~treble@user/treble) (Quit: WeeChat 3.4)
[23:13:01] <e36freak> do the patterns need to match the exact first 8 bytes?
[23:13:14] <e36freak> because just extracting that and testing it against the patterns should be much faster than a regex
[23:13:20] <e36freak> this is more #python territory though
[23:14:09] <e36freak> as it stands you're doing a regex search, which isn't super efficient, across the entire line, when you only care about the first 8 bytes
[23:14:30] <dreamon> its running on a slow raspberrypi.. I will test this out.
[23:15:26] <dreamon> yes, your right. but doing this in python its slows a lot more i think.
[23:16:35] <e36freak> well written python could well be faster than grep, also depends on what interpreter you're using
[23:16:51] <e36freak> if you really care about speed, write a purpose built program in a compiled language
[23:17:01] <ormaaj> Does grep use the libc regcomp? or own custom regex? It must have some middle layer interface that plugs into multiple matchers I would hope.
[23:17:32] <e36freak> knowing GNU it probably has its own lib
