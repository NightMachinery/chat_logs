[04:04:59] <nij-> I read this an got inspired: https://nyxt.atlas.engineer/article/getting-started-on-nyxt-hacking-1-bookmarklet.org
[04:05:42] <nij-> Some question.. instead of injecting JS as plaintext into CL, can we write bookmarklet using CL codes? (maybe with parenscript?)
[04:06:49] <nij-> 2. The inspector is nice and comprehensive. Which package did nyxt use? However, it doesn't seem to support key bindings. Will nyxt include its own console/inspector in the future whose keybindings (and more) are configurable?
[04:07:34] <pedro-delfino> @nij-, yes, it is possible. There are several commands in Nyxt using this approach.
[04:07:55] <pedro-delfino> Take a look on the go-next, go-up commands
[04:15:39] <nij-> Will do! (By the way, is there a way to view the source code in nyxt? I will dig into the repo anyways.)
[04:21:03] <nij-> pedro-delfino: Those are nice examples using the package quri! Thanks :)
[04:21:13] <nij-> How about codes that access to the DOM of the webpage?
[04:22:37] <pedro-delfino> Execute command =describe-command= choose go-next
[04:22:47] <pedro-delfino> Thus, you will see the code of this command
[04:23:30] <nij-> Oh!! I used =describe-function=, and got no code. Thanks for the tip!
[04:23:50] <nij-> I guess this is one of the example that uses parenscript..? https://github.com/atlas-engineer/nyxt/blob/d48a1ab1a82c6fbf5c34b5f9cb39046cd29868c6/source/mode/element-hint.lisp#L22
[04:23:53] <nij-> So elegant..
[04:23:58] <pedro-delfino> nij-: 2 - Nyxt already has a repl. But it is limited. You can do some things that you would do in a console. Like basic mathâ€¦
[04:24:30] <nij-> Well, using swank or slynk connects us to the almighty lisp repl in emacs!
[04:25:13] <nij-> However, the web based console has something more that's specific for the web. For example, you can interact with the elements (by pressing buttons) and get its path and parents ..etc.
[04:25:31] <nij-> But it's a complicated GUI, so I wonder how one can develop a keyboard centric control for it.
[04:25:32] <pedro-delfino> nij-: about the DOM, have a look on the   =document-model= function. A lot of interesting things to study
[04:35:47] <pedro-delfino> Nyxt Academy is officially released, guys!

[16:39:55] <pedro-delfino> ardon: not sure about the transcript, @ardon. Producing and editing videos is already a big task. Most nyxt users seem to at least understand English
[16:41:09] <pedro-delfino> It would be great to have some volunteers helping with this matter
[16:41:50] <pedro-delfino> The videos will be self hosted too. Not in my personal blog. But on Nyxtâ€™s official website.
[16:48:02] <ardon> pedro-delfino: Sure, I can imagine. Perhaps not a transcript per say but just a blog entry or similar with the notes used to produce the video. It would certainly help expand Nyxt's textual knowledge base. Thank you for your efforts!
[16:50:57] <pedro-delfino> Thanks for the support, man :)
[16:51:33] <pedro-delfino> ardon: so, some videos are based on articles. This one annotations is based on an article that I wrote. The article will be published soon in our blog
[16:52:50] <pedro-delfino> The article has a pointer to the new YouTube video
[16:54:23] <pedro-delfino> I should also try to provide the other way around, inserting a reference of the article on the video
[16:54:29] <pedro-delfino> Maybe a card in the end of the video
[16:54:43] <ardon> pedro-delfino: Ooh, in that case that's more than enough ðŸ™‚. Always glad to see new content
