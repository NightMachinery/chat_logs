[00:59:26] <bonky> alright i'm feeling a little crazy. i'm reading a paper that seems to use, in one line with no justification, that ∫|K(t/cₙ)G(t) - G(t)|²dt ≤ 1/cₙ² [∫|x|k(x)dx]²∫|tG(t)|dt, where K and G are the fourier transforms of k and g, respectively. is it obvious to anyone where this comes from?
[00:59:54] <Z-module> tolarz: so if you have any subset X of a group G, the subgroup <X> that it generates is typically a proper superset of X.  (Iff X itself is not already a subgroup.)
[01:00:16] <bonky> excuse me there should be a square in the second integral: ∫|K(t/cₙ)G(t) - G(t)|²dt ≤ 1/cₙ² [∫|x|k(x)dx]²∫|tG(t)|²dt
[01:01:30] <bonky> the context is related to kernel density estimation, so the lhs is the integrated squared bias of a kernel density estimate
[01:02:01] <bonky> expressed in terms of the fourier transforms by plancherel

[03:50:20] <isekaijin> tusko: A set of Lebesgue measure zero is a set that, for measure-theoretic purposes, is “very small”.
[03:50:57] <greenbagels> so like, sets of finitely many points have measure zero

[03:53:49] <tusko> So what would it mean for some many functions to be different on such a set? That there are many functions which are different and yet all the same?

[06:26:41] <Z-module> No, your family doesn't. I was merely pointing out that for T to be a topology on a set X, T needs to contain all unions of things in T, but only needs to contain *finite* intersections of things in T. If X is finite to begin with, then everthing in sight is finite so you don't need to mention it.
[06:26:48] <greenbagels> you have finitely many subsets in your example so this correction doesn't make a difference in this specific case

[06:30:07] <greenbagels> sbrown: finite is an important property, if you consider X_n = (0-1/n, 1+1/n), the infinite intersection of X_n is [0,1], which (under the standard topology on R) is closed and not open

[09:06:29] <somiaj> well if t=0, then you get ( cos(w)/(1-sin(w)), 0 ), while if t = pi/2 you get (0, -1), which aren't equal, so this does depend on t, so I don't see there would be a way to eliminate t.

[09:22:02] <isekaijin> pikapika: It would be more helpful if you described the problem that you are actually trying to solve.
[09:22:36] <pikapika> isekaijin, visually this seems to be generating a circle
[09:22:40] <isekaijin> Rather than the step where you got stuck (which might come after a bunch of earlier mistakes).
[09:22:53] <pikapika> I am not being able to verify analytically whether it should indeed be a circle or some other curve that looks close to a circle
[09:22:53] <isekaijin> What do you mean by “this”?
[09:23:00] <pikapika> isekaijin, the curve above
[09:23:17] <pikapika> I obtained it by stereographic projection of a great circle at an angle omega to the x-y plane
[09:23:25] <pikapika> *w
[09:23:57] <isekaijin> pikapika: What values of the parameter w have you tried?
[09:24:07] <isekaijin> You said that it's a constant parameter.
[09:24:23] <pikapika> A bunch. I made a small animation with omega ranging from 0 to pi/2 in small increments
[09:24:30] <pikapika> and it appeared to be just circles of increasing radii
[09:24:38] <isekaijin> (Maybe “parameter” is not the most fortunate word, since we use “parameter” to denote the coordinate of a curve.)
[09:24:42] <pikapika> isekaijin, yeah w is just the angle of the great circle to the X-Y plane
[09:24:45] <isekaijin> Ah.
[09:26:16] <pikapika> isekaijin, yeah calling 'w' a parameter was confusing

[09:54:53] <isekaijin> I used the information you gave to reconstruct the equation of the circle.
[09:54:58] <pikapika> Well I said stereographic projection
[09:55:12] <pikapika> But wow, you managed to find the circle equation

[09:55:31] *** Joins: loganlee[gnu] (~Thunderbi@user/loganlee)
[09:55:42] <isekaijin> It wasn't hard. I already knew that the center of the circle is on the x axis, so I only had to find its x coordinate, which I called c.
[09:55:50] <isekaijin> Then (x-c)^2 + y^2 is the square of the radius.
[09:55:54] <pikapika> isekaijin, I have also observed great circles that are lying on planes with fully asymmetric direction cosines are projecting as ellipses. I will see if I am adapt this analysis for that as well.

[13:20:59] <gurkenglas> So that's what "hit Ctrl-K to paste, Ctrl-C to abort" was about.
[13:21:44] <gurkenglas> I think that sequence is generated by round(some simple formula of the index), how should I figure out the formula?
[13:21:50] <river> gurkenglas: oeis.org
[13:22:09] <river> maybe graph it?
[13:22:13] <HisShadow> Newton interpolation polynomial :P
[13:22:25] <gurkenglas> river, the sequence is not that nice. I did graph it and that's not quite enough.

[13:22:57] <HisShadow> river: it''s not on oeis
[13:23:09] <gurkenglas> I mean, maybe I can remove patterns I see until only noise remains and then the inverse is my formula, but you'd think this is a common enough thing for there to be a tool

[13:23:43] <HisShadow> gurkenglas: not really, you can fit several things to produce the same sequence at the start
[13:23:43] <gurkenglas> Related: Sometimes I see a random-looking number, how do I check whether there it's actually something like "round pi^2/e to 10 digits"?
[13:24:00] <river> ah there was a site for that
[13:24:02] <gurkenglas> If that doesn't exist, maybe I'll just code it.

[20:32:49] <cadmio> Hello
[20:33:13] <z6np-6w> Rust and Julia are kind of the two new future languages I like, Rust for systems programming and Julia for science and math programming or higher level things.
[20:33:18] <pikapika> After experimenting with the 3d plots a bit I understand now
[20:34:13] <cadmio> can a finite field be algebrically closed?
[20:34:28] <z6np-6w> Racket scheme is really advanced too, also works on LLVM now, and a real pleasure to work with for things it's good at.
[20:34:31] <pikapika> While yes, the projection is unintuitively a circle, what is happening is that the circle is asymmetric wrt the projection of the sphere center (the spheres center projects to (0,0) in both orthographic and stereographic projections)
[20:35:00] <confuzeus> isn't racket a bloat. i prefer guile!
[20:35:07] <z6np-6w> haha lol!
[20:35:28] <z6np-6w> I'll take the bloat thanks np got a new SSD ;)
[20:35:41] <pikapika> So for instance the lobe of the great circle in the northern hemisphere is projecting to distant points that build up the major segment of the projected circle
[20:36:04] <pikapika> and the southern hemisphere lobe likewise is projecting to the remaining smaller segment
[20:36:23] <z6np-6w> guile with Geiser might be pretty ok if it has a repl up to racket's quality confuzeus
[20:36:27] <pikapika> It will be interesting to find the inverse of (0,0) back on the original great circle

[21:06:15] <Galois> Plazma: I find induction is a lot easier to demonstrate than to lecture about. The most strictly correct way is to use a proof assistant, but even something like racket allows you to actually do induction in code.

[21:07:08] <z6np-6w> Here's a trick to solve a problem by not thinking about it. It reflects the problem into your subconscious. Say you lost your keys. Try hard to remember what you were doing with your keys then *IMMEDIATELY* shift mental focus to something completely different but keep in mind that you were still considering that problem then just try to not think about it and the results will return.

[21:41:02] <auk> hi channel, anyone familiar with arithmetic coding (for data compression)? i've been playing around with an implementation, but it doesnt quite have the properties I want. Trying to figure out how to adapt it
[21:41:43] * ski was thinking of "taxonomy", but isn't too clear on what tolarz has in mind
[21:41:55] <z6np-6w> ski, sometimes you realize you're just going around forever in some doom spiral thats not going anywhere and you just have to turn around and report it was a dead end :D
[21:42:22] <ski> is that related to induction or recursion ?
[21:42:36] <z6np-6w> yeah i kind of think so
[21:42:53] <ski> reminds me of iterative deepening, i guess
[21:43:00] <z6np-6w> the infinite recursion leads to the inductive solution
[21:43:15] <ski> (no idea what you mean by that)
[21:43:28] <auk> I want to decode *without* having metadata for the length of original message. So my idea was to just guess/brute-force the length. I expected it to give gibberish when length was incorrect, but it doesn't. Which means i can't use randomness heuristics to detect which decoding is the right one
[21:43:30] <z6np-6w> its a way to think about problems

[22:31:36] <Galois> yes, you are correct. If K is empty then the properties hold but the statement you wish to prove does not hold.
[22:32:12] <zeroc00l0> Then assuming the consistency of arithmetic, the statement I want to prove does not follow from those properties alone?
[22:32:17] <Galois> in some theories of discourse, one is allowed to presume that any universe being presented is nonempty
[22:32:38] <Galois> for example in set theory some authors do not explicitly state that there exists a set

[22:36:39] <zeroc00l0> The text I'm working in has already pointed out that the axioms for another system (which includes all of those axioms) are insufficient for deciding whether the universe is non-empty or not.
