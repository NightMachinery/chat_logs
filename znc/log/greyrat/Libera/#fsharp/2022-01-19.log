[19:31:14] <hseg> Hi -- looking for a csharp channel, anyone know if there is one here?
[19:44:22] <biberu> there's #csharp
[19:44:29] <biberu> ofc it's inferior to #fsharp
[19:44:55] <biberu> hseg ^
[19:48:59] <hseg> huh, alis didn't mention it, odd
[19:49:01] <hseg> ty!
[19:50:55] <biberu> hseg: i think it's marked as secret
[19:51:20] <biberu> don't know why, maybe MatthiasVance does
[19:52:42] <MatthiasVance> 17:57 <MatthiasVance> Is it time to try (again) to remove +s from the channel?
[19:52:57] <MatthiasVance> 20:15 <Kog|Work> why would you do such a silly thing
[19:53:34] <MatthiasVance> We had LOTS of spammers and trolls and whatnot
[19:53:56] <MatthiasVance> I'm up for removing it though
