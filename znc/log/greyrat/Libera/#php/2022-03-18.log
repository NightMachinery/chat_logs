[00:48:19] <Albright> last1: Are you just running "php.exe" by itself with nothing else? Assuming it works the same as the Unix version, it's waiting for input.
[00:48:37] <Albright> You probably want to use '-f' to specify a path to a file to execute, or '-a' if you want to run a REPL.
[00:48:46] <last1> oh, I see

[01:11:53] <ryzenda> Albright, Thanks. I figured out that my shared webhost is killing PHP sessions after 30 seconds, which is why APCu is not saving the session data, so now I need to figure out a secure, fast, efficient way to save session data on a shared webhost environment.
[01:12:01] *** Quits: Poboy (~Poboy@user/poboy) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[01:12:21] <__adrian> _sessions_ ?
[01:12:31] <__adrian> or processes?
[01:12:49] <Albright> If you have a process which takes over 30 seconds to execute, you might be hitting the limit of what is practical to host on shared hosting.
[01:12:53] <__adrian> ^
[01:13:11] <__adrian> if you mean the session files are being deleted after 30s, that's something to talk to them about
[01:13:30] <__adrian> but if just your php process... don't run that long, that's silly
[01:14:52] <ryzenda> __adrian, Specifically related to MediaWiki 1.37.1 installation ( $wgSessionCacheType = CACHE_ACCEL; ) where when I try to edit content over 30 seconds after last access, error message "Sorry! We could not process your edit due to a loss of session data." appears (probably because the php74.cgi process is killed 30 seconds after the request
[01:15:05] <Albright> Ahhhh.
[01:15:07] <ryzenda> I can't run a memcached or redis server in the shared webhosting environment
[01:15:27] <__adrian> that's fairly normal
[01:15:43] <__adrian> shared hosting isn't usually meant for that kind of thing.
[01:15:43] <Albright> I think it's possible to host them in MySQL, but I've never looked into it.
[01:16:06] <da_wunder> shared hosting is not for anything "custom"
[01:16:18] <Albright> I think deleting session files after 30s is pretty unreasonable though.
[01:16:39] <da_wunder> yep that sounds really weird
[01:16:43] <Albright> Definitely would talk to the hosting provider first because that's ridiculous. Maybe there's a misconfiguration on their part and they need to fix it.
[01:16:49] <ryzenda> I'm currently using DreamHost, but I'm not sure if it's suitable long-term
[01:17:30] <Albright> Hmm, they should know better, but who knows.
[01:17:33] <ryzenda> because a week ago I learned that they not run their service where the PHP user is the same user as me (web admin), and therefore has access to every file

[01:19:15] <ryzenda> yep, and this account expires later this year, so I'll switch before then. I just don't know who to switch to yet, lol
[01:19:29] <__adrian> well, so long as you're aware that the majority of shared hosting, in similar pice brackets, are mostly equally bad

[01:30:04] <daoumilseitek> we don't know if those 30s are about processing power ryzenda
[01:30:24] <daoumilseitek> could they be about external api requests, emails sending or similar ?
[01:30:50] <daoumilseitek> but even if they are about processing power, you might want to try queues
[01:31:01] <daoumilseitek> to have reasonable request answer times
[01:31:26] <daoumilseitek> you don't necessarily need redis or memcache
[01:31:55] <daoumilseitek> if you don't need < 1 min processing delay, you can replace those with a database queue + crontab
[01:32:09] <daoumilseitek> fairly easy in laravel
[01:32:09] <Albright> daoumilseitek: The 30s was not continuous processing.
[01:32:12] <da_wunder> use blackfire.io to spot that kind of problems...
[01:32:37] <daoumilseitek> also, external queues with managed redis instances is possible

[01:33:32] <da_wunder> but now some sleep ->
[01:36:03] <Sammitch> moving to another shared host is like choosing a different flavor of turd sandwich.
[01:39:51] <ryzenda> daoumilseitek, the processing is less than a second, and then 30 seconds after the page is fully loaded and displayed, if I save the edits to publish, then the session cache is gone, cuz the php process is no longer running, but this is probably because APCu is not suitable for saving session data, and so it's a minor issue in this regard, and even though I can use MySQL database to store session data, and it works, I want to
[01:39:52] <ryzenda> make sure to prepare for a suitable fast/efficient way to deploy production quality website, albeit with limited resources, cuz I can't afford much right now.

[01:55:39] <hans> ryzenda: for DreamHost specifically, if you have a particular script that takes a long time to run, you have to explain the situation for customer support, they may then "temporarily add the account to the server resource limit whitelist" (last time they did that for me it was valid for 24 hours)
[01:56:21] <Albright> Guys, this isn't a case of a script taking a long time to run. y'all gotta read backscroll

[01:57:38] <hans> (in which case a 24 hour resource whitelist sounds adequate)
[01:57:47] <Albright> The problem is that sessions are not lasting longer than 30s because the session data files are being removed, apparently.

[11:31:13] <Naktibalda> maybe saying slim is more appropriate

[11:35:49] <ordos> Dad jokes aside, Naktibalda I'm curious if that's British English or American? Where I'm from we'll colloquially suggest something is "thin" if it's lacking, for example "That manual is well layed out but it's thin on the details"
[11:36:36] <ordos> Perhaps both are interchangeable but I more often hear "thin" instead of "slim" in this context

[20:34:17] <teresko> Albright: why would you want to use a framework to begin with?
[20:34:25] <teresko> why not just use composer packages?
[20:35:00] <Albright> because then I have to know of the package existence and decide which one to use.
[20:35:18] <Albright> But that might be the approach I end up using anyway since I just need something really simple.
[20:36:00] <teresko> routing, dic, tempalting ... what else you need?

[20:40:35] <teresko> ideally, it becomes 'not a php problem'
[20:40:40] <Albright> Nah. I want validation. I want the user redirected back to the form with the fields filled with the old values if validation fails, with the failed fields highlighted. Drupal was really good at this.
[20:41:35] <Albright> Laminas seems to have that.
[20:41:36] <teresko> you seem to confuse the part that could bve done as REST API call and the part that does all of the html fuckery
[20:42:30] <teresko> seriously, all those php-form-builders are a cancer
[20:43:09] <Albright> If you say so.
[20:44:24] <teresko> they work very well, for all the simple tasks, but when you actually get a complicated form with cimplicated validation and dynamic fieldsets, then you end up doing various hacks and workaround just to "somehow get it kinda working"

[20:53:50] <AllenJB> Failing that, don't the sessions have modified timestamp you can use to only delete old ones? Deleting all of them would kill any active sessions. Regularly (eg. hourly) expulsion of only old sessions would keep the table small, likely improving performance. Or better yet, store sessions in a cache such as memcached or redis that has built-in

[21:00:05] <coder7of9> AllenJB deleing keeps that id incrementing in the 400000   truncate clears the index. i could easily copy the last hours of data to a temp table and then copy it back.
[21:00:23] <da_wunder> coder7of9: and are you really having that many different users in your site at same time?
[21:00:42] <coder7of9> not users sessions
[21:00:44] <AllenJB> ids are unlikely to run out, especially if you're using bigints
[21:01:02] <da_wunder> not user sessions? so what are those "sessions" then?
[21:01:34] <coder7of9> not logged in user session but both just index (not loggedin

[21:01:51] <teresko> wat
[21:01:55] <coder7of9> maybe bots as mentioned. ... its a good point
[21:02:07] <teresko> are you or are youy not talking about $_SESSION storage?
[21:02:40] <coder7of9> each access results in an entry or last access update in the database with a session id

[21:18:28] <coder7of9> this is my inheritance.:)        the database entries in php sessions are used in a few ways. 1) expire sessions after 60 minutes of inactivity, 2) linking web activityto a user (in this case non athenticated as after authentication we have a user id) ... so you have a point that the requirement could be avoided
[21:21:20] <relipse> anyone have any experience with geoJSON?
[21:21:22] <coder7of9> i am curious to hear how others handle hph session ... in particular lapsing a session. it seems trivial with a cookie.

[21:45:16] <__adrian> well, that's a good practice for _validating) this particular input
[21:45:45] <teresko> is ther @ in the string - good, looks like email: send verification check
[21:45:47] <__adrian> doesn't meant there shouldn't be initial validation first. but my advice was general - you either accept it, or you show the user an error.
[21:45:52] <__adrian> yep
[21:45:59] <da_wunder> and that is a bit a different validation versus just validating syntax of email address
[21:46:10] <__adrian> yep
[21:46:13] <wwwi> would you consider the spaces in an email address, an error?
[21:46:21] <teresko> why?
[21:46:22] <__adrian> personally? no.
[21:46:38] <wwwi> because nobody uses spaces in their email address
[21:46:50] <__adrian> doesn't mean it's wrong
[21:46:54] <teresko> define "nobody"
[21:46:55] <__adrian> all kinds of stuff is valid in email addresses
[21:47:01] <da_wunder> ^
[21:47:15] <teresko> is it same kind of "nobody" as "nobody uses numbers in person's name" ?
[21:47:28] <wwwi> teresko, yes
[21:47:38] <teresko> well ... but they do
[21:47:57] <da_wunder> like name part is case sensitive FooBar@foo.com !== foobar@foo.com, but really all email providers are ignoring that rule
[21:48:50] <wwwi> so, this is a valid email address: test              @test.com ?
[21:49:42] <teresko> ues
[21:49:44] <teresko> yes
[21:50:00] <wwwi> I see, nice

[21:50:38] <teresko> if you do no get the verification - remove the account in few days
[21:50:56] <__adrian> believe you'd have to type it like  test"              "@test.com   though
[21:50:57] <da_wunder> wwwi: and please don't say that you're doing email syntax validation within some custom code in your application - use some library for that
[21:51:42] <wwwi> da_wunder, I am using a library
[21:52:17] <da_wunder> ok, and now you're confused because it passed those emails with spaces?
[21:52:19] <teresko> I have this very custom email validation library: false !== strpos($email, '@')
[21:52:38] <wwwi> da_wunder, yes, I was, now I am not
[21:53:07] <da_wunder> filter_var($email, FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL); is something that I have used
[21:53:30] <teresko> ^ for job intereview exercises
[21:53:42] <da_wunder> wwwi: yeah, sharing that context would help a lot
[21:53:54] <TinoDidriksen> filter_var is unfortunately awful for emails. Just check against regex ^.+?@.+?\..+$
[21:54:19] <teresko> what else do you need to chekc :D
[21:54:36] <AllenJB> What's with the ".+?" o_O
[21:55:03] <TinoDidriksen> Non-greedy one-or-more
[21:55:11] <da_wunder> and if you want some really strict, then use eg. https://github.com/egulias/EmailValidator
[21:55:18] <wwwi> da_wunder, the email validator passed those email with spaces, just like you said
[21:55:59] <teresko> because email address can have spaces
[21:56:07] <teresko> and it can have two @'s
[21:56:20] <TinoDidriksen> filter_var() can't handle IDN. Just all-round rubbish.

[22:07:30] <wwwi> teresko, which cms do you prefer?
[22:07:31] <__adrian> all regex-based email validators are either junk, or incomplete. FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL with FILTER_FLAG_EMAIL_UNICODE and also idn_to_ascii() is decent enough. but as mentioned... make sure it has a local part and a domain part and a tld, then send a verification email.
