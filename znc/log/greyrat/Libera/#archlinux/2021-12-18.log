[02:30:03] <mongy> it's probably stored in dconf file (.config/dconf/user) which you can view with dconf-editor.
[02:30:42] <mongy> I'm not familiar with it much, but that's where to view your settings.
[02:30:48] <Aardwolf> the only thing I find in there is a binary file

[02:31:24] <Aardwolf> so somehow cinnamon was using text file in ~/.cinnamon/config, and somehow now it's not doing that anymore and I need to reconfigure everything
[02:32:07] <Aardwolf> so it looks cinnamon has gone from simple to use desktop to something difficult without text config
[02:32:09] <mongy> I thought cinnamon was based on gnome, so used the same mechanism as
[02:32:18] <Aardwolf> is there possibly a good alternative for cinnamon in that case? I don't really like this kind of philosophy

I used KDE for a long time, but it started getting annoying at some point, e.g. it was always showing a gigantic volume icon whenever I change volume as if my PC is a television (which it's not), and the only way to disable that was to edit javascript file, and whenever archlinux updated KDE it reverted my JS changes. So, unusable

[02:44:02] <Aardwolf> but why...
[02:44:20] <mongy> it's quite usable tho.  you can view, and revert a setting to default.
[02:44:27] <Aardwolf> now I need to use a clunky GUI program instead of searchable easy to edit text
[02:44:28] <jmariondev> it's easy to automate

[02:45:31] <jmariondev> oh yeah, dconf-editor is GUI, but there's `dconf` on the command line and `gsettings` for a higher-level interface
[02:45:46] <Aardwolf> does it have a way to convert the org.blah.blah/4.json and such files that my cinnamon used to use until today, to the gconf thing?

[04:21:15] <Namarrgon> Vaporeon: the "core functionality" of libjxl is providing the .so, so technically this is okay even if it's annoying if your package depends on the tooling
[04:21:37] <Namarrgon> the tools should probably be split out into a separate package

[06:51:55] <Scimmia> yes, you would probably need to roll back all of that. Your best bet would be to install python 3.9 along side 3.10 and run that specifically, depending on the complexity of the software in question

[14:55:02] <fl4co> Hi. I'm trying to mount a NFS share at boot from /etc/fstab. It works if I'm using the IPv4 address, but if I use IPv6 or the domain name (which I think resolves first to an IPv6 address), the mount operation times out at boot and the systemd unit reports "Network in unreachable". I'm using Network Manager, and NetworkManager-wait-online.service is enabled. I also tried adding the _netdev mount option in 
[14:55:08] <fl4co> fstab, although it should be implicit with NFS. Is this a bug?

[18:34:10] *** Joins: fl4co (~fl4co@user/fl4co)
[18:34:20] <Foxboron> The reason people want the MOK keyring into the trusted keyring is to have lockdown move available
[18:34:36] <Foxboron> Which is curretly impossible to achive with out-of-tree kernel modules on Arch
[18:34:43] <mystiquewolf> yeah, the kernel lockdown, which i've apparently enabled
[18:34:44] <Foxboron> Adding the MOK is essentially a hack
[18:34:53] <mystiquewolf> how foolish of me
[18:35:26] <Foxboron> I'm annoyed it doesn't include the full set of secure boot keys... I dislike the MOK
[18:35:27] <mystiquewolf> but i think i've red somewhere that enabling secure boot causes the kernel to reject out-of-tree modules.., not sure if it's true
