[00:50:52] <emanuele6> `e' command?
[00:52:49] *** Joins: Tach (~Tach@user/tach)
[00:53:08] <emanuele6> oh, it's a GNU sed extension that executes the pattern space and replaces it with the output of the command with trailing newlines removed
[00:53:11] <emanuele6> interesting.
[00:53:22] <emanuele6> it is only documented in the info page
[00:56:17] <libc> wierd.. the manpage itself is managed by gnu
[00:56:52] <emanuele6> it is not uncommon for some feature of GNU program to only be documented in the info page
[00:57:17] <libc> that's why i read mostly info pages
[00:57:34] <libc> it's also more detailed than the man page
[00:58:05] <libc> the an page is not for learning is for referencing 
[00:58:43] <libc> i wish there were info pages for everything linux
[01:04:20] <libc> emanuele6: i glad you learned something from me 
[01:04:26] <libc> `e' :D
[01:05:27] <emanuele6> i am playing with it; it seems to stop execution of the whole script if an `e' command fails
[01:06:32] <emanuele6> but you can make it not fail using `s/$/ || :/' i guess
[01:09:06] <emanuele6> like `!' in ex/vim basically
[01:09:12] <libc> yeah
[01:11:29] <emanuele6> sed -n -e :a -e 'e sleep 1' -e 's/.*/hello/p' -e ba -e q
[01:15:28] <libc> :a ?
[01:15:47] <emanuele6> it's a label
[01:19:17] <libc> why it requires an ente r?
[01:19:23] <libc> to start spamming hello
[01:19:54] <emanuele6> you just need to pass it a newline
[01:20:07] <emanuele6> this would also work: <<< '' sed -n -e :a -e 'e sleep 1' -e 's/.*/hello/p' -e ba -e q
[01:20:48] <libc> oh right it expect input from command line if INPUTFILE is not provided
[01:21:33] <libc> that's a here strin
[01:21:36] <libc> g
[01:22:00] <libc> emanuele6: i like your command line wizardry
[01:24:02] <emanuele6> find . -print0 | sed -z -n -e 's/'\''/'\''\\'\'\''/g' -e 's/.*/'\''&'\''/' -e h -e 's@.*@cat -- & 2> /dev/null || :@' -e e -e '/bash/ { g; p; }' | tr '\0' '\n

[01:42:22] <emanuele6> the main thing i don't like about GNU sed is that distributions don't also install it as gsed like they do with GNU awk
[01:43:00] <emanuele6> when i want to use an extension in awk, i simply call awk as gawk and it is clear i need GNU awk to run it
[01:43:21] <earnestly> This why I appreciate the rust reinventions of tools, they give them new names.  GNU clearly created new tools, so using the same name is just bad manners
[01:43:38] <emanuele6> with sed extensions, it is not as clear. and using GNU extensions in a commandline sed makes feel bad
[01:43:40] <earnestly> I think the BSDs will install them typically with the 'g' prefix
[01:44:31] <emanuele6> s/feel/you feel/
[01:45:13] <emanuele6> earnestly: yeah, i know, but if you use gsed in a script for linux it won't work because GNU sed is not also installed as gsed
[01:45:40] <earnestly> Yep
[01:46:09] <emanuele6> there would be no problem if there were gmake, gm4, gsed, etc on linux

[12:10:05] <libc> e36freak: sed '/pat/N;P

[13:37:44] <veltas> I know I need to use N to put \n in pattern space, but can't seem to get this working, using GNU sed
[13:38:36] <emanuele6> i don't think i understand the question
[13:38:57] <veltas> What don't you understand
[13:39:06] <emanuele6> why did you mention `N'?
[13:39:38] <emanuele6> initially i thought you just wanted to perform an operation on only the line terminated by \r\n
[13:40:03] <veltas> It's my understanding you need to use the N command to substitute a newline
[13:40:14] <emanuele6> what?
[13:40:42] <emanuele6> no, to substitute a newline, like anything else, you use the `s' command

[13:44:50] <veltas> emanuele6: What I meant by that is that \n doesn't appear in the pattern space unless you've done something like N
