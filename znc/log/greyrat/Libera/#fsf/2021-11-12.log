[00:43:30] <iShareFreedom> can someone translate this: Estoy ahorrando para comprarme una PC que sea compatible con software libre, me gustar√≠a usar PureOS, o GNU Guix con gnome, si me gusta gnome :D. Ahora mismo estoy usando Debian en mi laptop, ya me permite usarla, pese a eso estoy sin los repositorios no-libres y sin los contrib.
[00:43:43] <iShareFreedom> ggoes gnu guix is so cool
[00:43:47] <djatropine> guix is neat

[00:43:54] <ggoes> i agree
[00:43:58] <tpefreedom> Armand, no
[00:44:00] <iShareFreedom> i dont use nonfree software Armand
[00:44:04] <tpefreedom> google translate bad
[00:44:14] <tpefreedom> also bad at translating longer stuff
[00:44:21] <Armand> I am saving money to buy a PC that is compatible with free software, I would like to use PureOS, or GNU Guix with gnome, if I like gnome: D. Right now I am using Debian on my laptop, it already allows me to use it, despite that I am without the non-free repositories and without the contrib.
[00:44:31] <djatropine> ishare:  i admit i enjoy commodore/amiga/atari stuf 
[00:44:32] <Armand> Seems pretty accurate to me.
[00:44:40] <tpefreedom> I prefer KDE to gnome.
[00:44:51] <djatropine> i love the ease of use of i3 :D
[00:44:54] <iShareFreedom> KDE is good for customisation
[00:45:07] <tpefreedom> djatropine, i3 is quite nice
[00:45:09] <iShareFreedom> but i like the simple of gnome, and is ready to use
[00:45:13] <Armand> Not looked at KDE for a long time.
[00:45:19] <Armand> Been using Mint Cinnamon for years.
[00:45:33] <tpefreedom> i used winblows 10 before I used GNU/Linux

[00:53:22] <Armand> Less said about Win8/10/11, the better.
[00:53:39] <djatropine> i confess: i love the feel and flow of AROS :D
[00:54:07] <iShareFreedom> Armand, here isnt for promotion of nonfree software.

[04:49:20] <djatropine> hi
[04:52:48] <djatropine> ggoes: i want someone ot host a mediagoblin instance for me :D
[04:54:03] <ggoes> it would be nice to have more of those
[04:55:13] <djatropine> i find youtube/etc. difficult to use :( 
[04:56:24] <djatropine> mediagoblin .. .easy and convienient. 
[04:58:48] <djatropine> One time i was around some folks who said 'oh were nerds'  after my canabis kicked in  'wel i have a cat named gnu.'  lets get stoned 
[05:05:26] <tpefreedom> Kaiod, what is the group about?
[05:05:30] <Armand> Are there still people that think smoking weed is "cool" ?
[05:06:08] <Kaiod> if allowed, I would like to copy some things from this page, including some templates, as this board is possibly an updated version of GNU Generation
[05:07:33] <Kaiod> tpefreedom: This group in this case is for the LibrePlanet Student Council, a student representation of affiliated and interested students of FSF projects.
[05:07:40] <ggoes> Kaiod: sounds good to me
[05:08:24] <Kaiod> Kaiod: Historically, we call these representations the student movement, commonly called the student government
[05:08:29] <Kaiod> ggoes: =)
[05:09:54] <djatropine> arm:  not cool it's medication.   
[05:10:23] <ggoes> Kaiod: i think just copy for now, though, rather than rename pages; gnu generation might be a thing again at some point. not the best name in the world, but it's still linked to in places, and it might make sense to have a space specifically for younger students
[05:11:03] <djatropine> armand: now taking bonghits and emacs does lead to a spiritual experience :D
[05:11:16] <ggoes> i'll have to do some research on what the thinking was behind that and how it interacted with college groups
[05:13:40] <Kaiod> ggoes: I think the question of the council can be easier to convene youth and students, because the name brings a deliberative power that empowers students to take action, I thought of an organization based on the student movement (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Students%27_union). What do you think about the issue of names?
[05:14:02] <djatropine> i don't kno whow academia is these days .  
[05:15:35] <ggoes> Kaiod: i have a slight preference for "council" over "union" because at least in the us, a "student union" will often be a building and not a group 
[05:15:42] <ggoes> but i like the idea of the group name encouraging initiative
[05:16:34] <djatropine> council.. that's like the nibiru council,. the elohim council :D
[05:16:49] <Armand> djatropine: Yes, Emacs condemns you to hell. :P
[05:17:53] <djatropine> armand: emacs condemns me to hell?   
[05:18:33] <Armand> Well, of course.. using Emacs is hell. lol
[05:18:47] <Armand> For anyone not up to speed, it's a joke.
[05:19:01] <ggoes> vi vi vi is the editor of the beast
[05:19:12] <djatropine> armand; every time i see a Windows 7/8/9/9/10 screen i have to go to e emacs terminal for repentence
[05:19:17] <Armand> Nano4lyf!
[05:19:31] <Kaiod> ggoes: Council in this case, I think is better because the word carries the meaning of opinion, teaching or warning as to what is to be done. We use union, because it is all students in one place, regardless of opinion or thought. In this case it makes no sense for us to accept the student who advocates the use of global windows, for example.
[05:19:36] <Armand> djatropine: They made two versions for 9?!? O_o
[05:19:49] <Armand> Didn't know Windows 9 was even a thing..
[05:20:01] <ggoes> Kaiod: agreed
[05:20:21] <djatropine> i dunno.  i created a OS called WinDex 1.0  . I's the cleanest windows ever
[05:20:26] <Armand> hahahaa

[08:34:47] <coyotes4ys> up is hard to define. some might say, 'up is the opposite of down.' but of course, that is a statement that says nothing, except relationship between up and down. so what is up? MY DUDES
[08:35:31] <Armand> What's up??
[08:35:36] <Armand> Ceiling tiles, right now.
[08:36:21] <DiffieHellman> I'm looking through the rtl8812au Wi-Fi driver and seemingly the firmware is in; hal8812a_fw.c and hal8821a_fw.c Those files also have a GPLv2 header from Realtek. Could one theoretically do a GPL request to get the actual source of such firmware? 
[08:37:44] <coyotes4ys> riveting. or possibly, unattached
[08:37:54] <DiffieHellman> It seems that the firmware is licensed as free software, but it is obfuscated.
[08:38:04] <coyotes4ys> sorry not talking to you diffie
[08:38:19] <DiffieHellman> coyotes4ys: Not talking to you either.
[08:38:25] <coyotes4ys> i know

[08:41:38] <DiffieHellman> No, but as the code is licensed under the GPLv2 they need to provide the actual source when asked. Even if they won't provide the sources, they legally can't do anything against you if you reverse engineer the binaries thankfully.
[08:43:25] <coyotes4ys> if they won't provide source they are sue-able

[08:45:43] <DiffieHellman> Technically yes, but that's a pain in the ass. I'm not sure what these drivers are based off really. If they're based off Linux only, then you can sue, otherwise they'll go "lol" and widthdraw the GPLv2. I haven't analysed the driver enough though.

[08:48:14] <coyotes4ys> if they put it out under gpl, i don't think it's legal to just rescind the gpl. saving proof, taking it to fsf peoples, is the good stuff
[08:49:26] <DiffieHellman> They can't withdraw the GPLv2 on the released version no, but they can probably screw you over in court if they can convince the court to let them withdraw it.

[13:51:19] <V-T60> Is this still correct information? 
[13:52:29] <la_mettrie> do you mean smartphones or mobile phones more generally?
[13:54:31] <DiffieHellman> V-T60: It's pretty simple, just take a hammer to your current tracking device (just make sure the battery isn't fully charged). It is correct that rms doesn't have one.
[13:54:53] <DiffieHellman> rms has never had one as he dislike being spied on 24/7.
[13:56:22] <DiffieHellman> If you still require a mobile, and it runs Android, the best thing you can do without purchasing anything is to install LineageOS without google services (still proprietary though) and LineageOS doesn't support much either.
[13:56:47] <V-T60> la_mettrie: I am interested in both
[13:57:36] <DiffieHellman> Smartphones is general can't be saved due to the usual integration of the mobile chipset into the SoC
[13:58:21] <la_mettrie> V-T60: you think it's necessary to have a smartphone? for what purpose?
[13:59:14] <DiffieHellman> Dumbphones don't really exist anymore. Any new dumbphone that does LTE probably runs Android, but just doesn't change the settings.
[13:59:34] <DiffieHellman> *allow you to changes the settings
[13:59:42] <V-T60> la_mettrie: unfortunately, that is exactly what I did couple of years ago

[14:19:56] <la_mettrie> for public places there has been always an alternative (to print a paper with a QR-code). for certain applications (these days including Telegram), smartphone is needed and can be only circumvented by using Android emulator

[20:30:30] <craigt> Turn up the house lights!' It is time for this week's Free Software Directory meeting. If you are new or just want a refresher, check out the participation guidelines. https://directory.fsf.org/wiki/Free_Software_Directory:Participate
[20:31:33] <craigt> White_Flame: True. So we might need some clarity for what benjwadams meant by "where it came from".
[20:32:28] <benjwadams> craigt, I don't know.¬† I just see a web application that almost certainly uses code from a GitHub repository I'm a major contributor to
[20:33:23] <benjwadams> I'm not looking to throw the book at anyone, just wondering if attribution needs to be done for web applications as well -- I know some GPL versions have a term for that (conveyance?¬† don't remember)
[20:34:18] <corwin> o/
[20:35:37] <craigt> corwin: Hi. Welcome to the FSD meeting. Glad you could make it.
[20:36:07] <craigt> We also have the directory-discuss mailing list which you can sign up for at https://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/directory-discuss
[20:36:42] <corwin> :D me too.  I was able to get a PTO day for volunteering and splitting the time between a few different projects but I especially wanted to drop by the meeting as I've not been able for sometime.
[20:36:58] <bpv> Hi
[20:38:13] <corwin> craigt: I thought I would spend a few hours today working on the image-sucker-license-verifify script I'd been playing around with some time ago.  Is that task still relivant (would it be good to have more freely licensed images attached to more FSD pages?)

[20:43:52] <bpv> Question: How long does it usually take to get a new entry approved in the FSD?
[20:44:31] <craigt> corwin: Awesome! Thank you.
[20:44:51] <craigt> bpv: Definitely depends on the entry.

[21:34:50] <craigt> bpv: So far so good, I noticed the README file does not have the -or-later for the GPLv2, but all of the code files seem to have the -or-later.
[21:35:44] <bpv> craigt: Yah, I saw that too, could have been just an oversight.
[21:36:06] <craigt> bpv: All the code files seem to have the -or-later, so a part of me thinks that is more important.
[21:37:00] <craigt> bpv: Would you like to add Software prerequisites? They are good to include, especially if they are already in the Directory.

[21:47:40] <bpv> craigt: Pretty fast.
[21:48:20] <craigt> bpv: It certainly helped that you filled out the entry fairly thoroughly.
[21:48:48] <corwin> craigt: making *some* progress. I've created a custom search with Google limited to searching wikimedia commons.  This (given an API key from Google) will invoke it: curl 'https://customsearch.googleapis.com/customsearch/v1?cx=7bb61bbe5040dbc8d&q=gnome&key=[GoogleApiKeyGoesHere]' --header 'Accept: application/json' --compressed
[21:49:01] <bpv> craigt: Didn't want to skip out on any details ;)
[21:49:38] <craigt> bpv: And that the project was fairly well licensed. The -or-later issue aside, most of the files had proper copyright/license notification headers.
[21:50:26] <corwin> I need to do something about food. I'll check back here for comments before I dive back in.
[21:50:37] <craigt> corwin: I'm curious, is that API free software?

[22:02:41] <tfisgnag> Hello. Sorry for the delay.¬† Two hours ago I was very sleep deprived. And I still am. Since last Friday I have tried to review what you taught me on previous Fridays. But I am somewhat surprised because when opening mailvelope-1.6.0.tar.gz (accessed through FSD) I now find there are more folders and files in it than when I first opened it. Has
[22:02:42] <tfisgnag> somebody made changes on it?
[22:03:13] <tfisgnag> you is craigt
[22:03:29] <craigt> tfisgnag: I am.
[22:03:41] <craigt> tfisgnag: No problem. Glad you could make it.

[22:04:40] <tfisgnag> I don't understand why the contents of mailvelope-1.6.0.tar.gz have changed-.
[22:04:53] <craigt> tfisgnag: That is a very old version of mailvelope, but it is the only version that was reviewed. It will definitely look different than the current version.
[22:05:00] <corwin> craigt: no idea, I'd assume not. I've not dont any research in that area as my output here is a collection of images (which need to be free/libere), vs the scripting/means of collection.
[22:07:22] <tfisgnag> Do you mean that the fist time I was reviewing it I was reviewing a very old version of Mailvelope and that what I can see now¬† in the FSD is the current version?

[22:10:54] <craigt> corwin: No judgement here. I don't think there is official stance on how volunteers do their work on the FSD. Heck, I assume there are people out there updating the FSD through a windows or mac. We certainly encourage everyone to only use free software, but as long as the approved entries are free software(I think we are good).

[22:58:49] <bpv> craigt: From what I heard, the creators are not really too picky about enforcing thier copyright unless it's being used to make massive amounts of money, promotions, and etc.
[22:59:38] <craigt> bpv: That may be, but I'm inclined to err on the side of caution.
[23:01:07] <craigt> bpv: Funny, I had a discussion just yesterday about the copyright status of memes in general. My take away was that it's a mess.
[23:01:52] <bpv> craigt: I could email the creators and see if they know.

[23:05:50] <bpv> I'm not the biggest fan of NFTs.
[23:05:53] <craigt> bpv: They might not, I agree. Technically, the FSD isn't distributing the image, only linking to it, but still probably best to avoid trouble.
[23:06:15] <craigt> bpv: I'll just say it. NFTs are stupid. 
[23:06:24] <bpv> craigt: I agree
[23:07:07] <corwin> Sounds like my next step involves implementing some sort of API for querying the FSD, so I can see what pages exist (in the approved status), and then which ones lack images?  I'll probably send thoughts to the ML on this but I'd welcome any here today also.
