[13:37:57] <Deknos> do you know of a easy possibility to use sql databases for state management? like i have a primary and secondary and the secondary becomes the primary, if the primary does not write into the database for a certain time?

[16:45:53] <rawtaz> Deknos: i mean, isnt that a regular master-slave setup that has been around for ages? just duck/google it and youll find a ton of hits
[17:03:39] <Deknos> yes, but using a database and developing and deploying it in 5 hours is somewhat tricky :D
[17:05:47] <Deknos> as it is really manually done..
[17:06:46] <rawtaz> i dont think anyone is following what youre actually asking.
[17:07:04] <rawtaz> please clarify your question and in particular the context - what actual problem are you trying to solve?
[17:10:22] <Deknos> forget it. i am in a new company and slowly i recognize that people want solutions yesterday and nothing shall cost anything. everything can just be hacked together. of course the solution shall be just easy and stable and well tested - and of course systemd is evil. (last thing is only a random side-note-rant which is not relevant but shows the attitude of the higherups)
[17:11:51] <rawtaz> one of them pesky workplaces where there are idiots :-)
[17:12:39] <lantech19446> Deknos: please never work in a non-profit if you don't like those environments
[17:13:41] <Deknos> at least the municipial company i worked in was very organized (too organized). 
[17:15:15] <Deknos> but this... 
[17:17:47] *** Joins: Alina-malina (~Alina-mal@user/alina-malina)
[17:19:53] <lantech19446> I just mean from the standpoint that in a non-profit you're doing everything with nothing it's a whole different ballgame than enterprise
[17:22:25] <rawtaz> they said "company" though, not non-profit :-)

[17:26:52] <lantech19446> non-profits are still companies lol
[17:27:19] <lantech19446> mine not so much because it's a library but plenty of non-profits still engage in business
[17:28:02] <rawtaz> iamtew: hmm in my country they arent, and i thought even in the US a 503(c) or whatever it's named wasnt a regular company too :o
[17:29:16] <iamtew> hello? :)
[17:30:32] <rawtaz> lo :P
[17:30:34] <rawtaz> lantech19446: ^
[17:36:06] <lantech19446> sorry had to run to the bathroom
[17:36:56] <lantech19446> rawtaz: the only thing a 503c can't do in the US is back politicians and turn a profit that doesn't mean we can't make money it just can't be profit generated
[17:39:39] <rawtaz> right, but it's still just a regular company, but with a couple of restrictions? TIL
[17:40:36] <lantech19446> in a lot of cases yes
[17:41:40] <lantech19446> I don't know if your country has thrift stores but in the US a lot of them are attached to churches or shelters so while most of the people interface with it as a normal business it's still a 501c3
[17:44:35] <rawtaz> i c
[17:50:06] <lantech19446> but yea one thing i've learned is how to live on no budget
[17:53:15] <rawtaz> :O
[17:53:20] <rawtaz> what's the secret to succeeding?
[17:54:36] <lantech19446> be willing to fix everything now matter how old is it. I just turned a decom server from 2014 into a 17.5Tib NAS yesterday
[17:55:05] <rawtaz> ah :)
[17:55:07] <rawtaz> thats good
[17:56:02] <lantech19446> yep and trueNAS so literally the only thing I bought was 3 10Tib drives
[18:02:29] <lantech19446> woohoo just put in a quote request for msp360 managed backup so pretty soon i'll have prtg my nas my backup solution all in place and we're gonna start looking like a real network
[18:29:17] <Deknos> lantech19446, because everything with nothing: normally you are not then critized for your ticket headers/names... "that's not the standard".
[18:30:19] <lantech19446> Deknos: to be honest we're so small we don't even use tickets there's less than 10 employees here and i'm the only tech so just call me or come talk to me
[18:31:54] <Deknos> ticketsystems can be good and bad. it's not about the system, but about the attitude.
[18:36:39] <lantech19446> I don't disagree with you, I always just saw it as a battle not worth having for me because I'm the only one who works on this stuff so I don't have knowledge i need to share. Been here for 13yrs not sure when that'll change
