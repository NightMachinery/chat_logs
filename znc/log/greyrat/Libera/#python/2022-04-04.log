[01:34:36] <Tritium> It hides implementation details, and lets you change the internal structure of your package without breaking user's codes, assuming they used the facade...  I'm not a huge fan
[01:34:40] <nedbat> foo: "Facade" is the name from the Design Patterns book for this kind of structure.
[01:36:06] <foo> Tritium: thank you, yes, I don't like it. Adds another layer of complexity in this use case, it doesn't simplify anything. I also think doing from api import connector rather than importing 8 functions in connect.py manually is easier. This connector is a core file, and without doing connector.something() we don't know where the link is

[06:03:10] <trafficjam> hey there, just got a question about categories in the abstract sense
[06:03:34] <trafficjam> what is the best way of combining user-generated categories and a global category hierarchy?
[06:04:26] <bpalmer> trafficjam: you mean categories like in genres, not categories like in the mathematical sense?
[06:04:38] <trafficjam> yeah exactly
[06:04:49] <trafficjam> like product categories
[06:05:00] *** Joins: CatCow (~wtf_over@c-73-96-109-206.hsd1.or.comcast.net)
[06:05:57] <bpalmer> I'd consider things like just turning them into tags: a product might be guaranteed to have at least one tag (from the global category hierarchy) and possibly more (from user tags)
[06:06:09] <trafficjam> i want to have a global category hierarchy, which makes it easy for people to search for products, but i also want to allow sellers to have their own categories (primarily because the possible range of all categories is so large that i wont be able to create the global system myself in a short amount of time)
[06:07:52] <trafficjam> hmm the thing about tags is (at least in my mind) they don't feel like concrete categorizations, but more like throwaway keywords
[06:09:07] <trafficjam> i.e. i don't want users filling up an item with a bunch of semi-related keywords, but with one a single (or maybe a few) exact categories
[06:09:37] <trafficjam> defining a category system like this is way harder than i thought it would be

[06:55:55] <muuo> Alternatively, you could use heuristics. e.g. Say you start out with "Ebook Reader", and "Kindle" in your global categories... and you start to see "Kobo" overlapping with "Ebook Reader"... then it's likely that "Kobo" is a child of "Ebook Reader".

[06:59:21] <trafficjam> muuo: yeah i considered both of these options, the issues i had with option #1 was that it would potentially be very slow, particularly for sellers, having to wait on validations until they could choose a category
[06:59:52] <trafficjam> and there's also the situation where a product might belong in more than one category and how to deal with that
[07:01:11] <trafficjam> The main thing i know (or feel quite strongly) is that the global category hierarchy is very important, and all other designs and schemas should be built around it
[07:01:28] <trafficjam> I should clarify i don't "know" this, but i have a strong feeling it's the case
[07:02:06] <muuo> Hmm, yeah! I was thinking about things from the seller's point of view... forgot that a(n up to date) global hierarchy is necessary for user search.

[07:06:15] <muuo> Hmm, yeah! I feel like at the end of the day any global model that you come up with will be lossy from the seller's perspective. You could just keep doing your own thing... and then map your hierarchy to the seller's using some approximate measure like levenshtein distance or proximity in some embedded space.

[09:53:12] <Guest51> Basically, I need to parse a string that was originally a `b4.element.Tag` object.¬† This is what the string looks like https://bpa.st/KNSQ . It contains the particular substring ` "data-mw='{\"parts\":" ` , which I have been trying to locate using re.search () . However, for this particular string, the method returns None. On the other hands, when
[09:53:12] <Guest51> I run the same method for the same substring on this string https://bpa.st/IXHQ it seems to easily locate it. The seeming difference between these two is, the first string has backslashes before the double quotes, when printed. AFAIK, that shouldn't cause a problem. I have also tried `string.split()` on it, with the same result.

[10:05:43] <anonymous1> A good part of the users here probably use screen or alternative to keep their irc sessions open, that way they can catch up on anything they missed

[10:06:25] <Guest51> It is a wikipedia article. Basically, the wikipedia enterprise html dump. This was created by parsing the original `wikitext` code TML

[10:07:45] <TML> Guest51: You might check out something like https://github.com/earwig/mwparserfromhell
[10:08:11] <Guest51> to handle `wikitext` i have used `mwparserfromhell` . But the HTML apparently needs separate handling.
[10:09:09] <Guest51> The objective is trying to replicate the `mwparserfromhell` as much as possible, but for the HTML code.

[13:40:28] <arseru> summonner: but I've debugged both requests (one with a valid jwt that uploads the file successfully, and another one with the expired -and refreshed- jwt that fails to upload) and both have empty cookies: `'_cookies': <RequestsCookieJar[]>`

[15:19:46] <Guest51> hi, all. Appledora here. I am only getting started in this chat, and my next question is going to be very dumb. so bear with me, if possible, somebody.
[15:19:47] <Guest51> Basically, I need to parse a string that was originally a b4.element.Tag object.  This is what the string looks like https://bpa.st/KNSQ . It contains the particular substring `data-mw='{\"parts\":` , which I have been trying to locate using re.search() . However, for this particular string, the method returns None. On the other hand, when I run
[15:19:47] <Guest51> the same method for the same substring on this string https://bpa.st/IXHQ it seems to easily locate it. The seeming difference between these two is, the first string has backslashes before the double quotes, when printed. AFAIK, that shouldn't cause a problem. I have also tried string.split() on it, with the same result.
[15:19:48] <Guest51> For more clarifications, the data I am trying to parse is HTML code parsed from wikitext of a wiki[edia article, grabbed from the Wikipedia Enterprise HTML-dump. I have previously used the `mwparserfromhell` library to process the `wikitext` code, and now trying to replicate the functions for the HTML counterpart.
[15:19:48] <Guest51> And TML , if you're around, hello again. Here's a link to my method : https://bpa.st/ZNKA .

[18:11:52] <wedwards> supakeen: could you elaborate on 'not joining threads is definitely not great'? I'm aware of the semantics of join() in C/C++, but what I've read tells me that not join()ing threads should be ok in Python. I'm also not sure on what 'don't want to keep threads around' means? As far as I can see, my process is currently on Thread-7 but 'ps huH' tells me it has one OS thread.
[18:11:53] <NoImNotNineVolt> if you want your text file to contain "\.", then that text file will not be json.
[18:12:02] <SnoopJ> at any rate, a document that contains a value "\." is not a valid JSON document
[18:12:10] <powftw> So I should decode json, write into a seperate file and open with my editor will be good?

[18:13:44] <Wooble> powftw: why do you need to escape the dot, and why do you want to see a single \?
[18:13:44] <NoImNotNineVolt> ultimately, the issue here is that there are two relevant sets of escaping rules. the rules imposed by json encoding (e.g. backslash escape all backslashes), and the rules specific to your use-case (e.g. backslash-escape all dots).

[20:05:51] <supakeen> You'd send SIGTERM, you'd handle it in your thread that's designated to handle signals. It would update some global state to indicate that the program is shutting down. All threads that are working continuously check this value and end their work. You don't start any new threads while it is set. You join() all threads.
[20:05:54] <supakeen> (and exit)
[20:05:59] <canurabus> I already handle SIGINT and SIGTERM to try and gracefully shutdown. I set up signal handling for those two in the main thread at the beginning of the program, and do my clean up, eventually calling join() on all the threads I use. This is for the exceptional case where that join call times out, then I want to forcefully terminate

[20:08:40] <supakeen> But it'd highly depend on why those threads time out.
[20:09:01] <supakeen> E.g. perhaps other threads aren't releasing their locks if you have any (but that'd be guesswork).

[21:12:19] <Wooble> kivy seemed promising for android/ios, no idea if it ever did linux phones.

[21:13:08] <supakeen> Kivy is a name I've heard of as well.
[21:13:31] <Wooble> TML: ok, but I assume anyone calling their phone a "linux phone" probably isn't running android for strong ideological reasons ;)

[21:21:16] <tarel2> What is a reason not to make mobile apps?
[21:21:23] <akk> It doesn't seem like the pinephone community does much development, at least, googling pine phone manjaro python gui is finding lots of people asking and not many answering.

[23:57:19] <Croves> About generators and yield: does yield terminates a function like `return`?

[23:58:25] <Bauderr> Croves, as far as I know it starts after the yeild statement
[23:58:33] <madduck> Croves: only if there is nothing left to yield.

[23:59:43] <foo> I believe this means I need pip install wheel - correct? https://bpa.st/Z2CQ
[23:59:52] <madduck> this will generate over mylist and once the for loop is done, the function implicitly returns at the end of the loop
