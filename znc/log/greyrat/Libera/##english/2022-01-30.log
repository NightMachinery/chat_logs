[00:01:38] <CuriosTiger> I would say "it's a little bigger". If you need mathematical precision, both of those alternatives are fine, and there's probably five other ways to say the same thing.
[00:01:44] <gneeriiloeepdeer> what expression can I use to talk about a judge who lets a case die down (simply by letting deadlines go by, so the case is no longer prosecutable ?

[00:02:25] <gneeriiloeepdeer> .w die down
[00:02:27] <tinsoldier> die down — Verb: 1. (intransitive, idiomatic) To become less virulent or strong; to subside. https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/die_down
[00:02:39] <CuriosTiger> you could say it's 125% of the original size. You could say it's a quarter larger than the original. You could say it grew by a quarter. Or by 25%. Or by a factor of .25%
[00:02:56] <wodes> gneeriiloeepdeer case closed without further action?
[00:03:41] <LuisR14> it's gotten bigger!
[00:04:20] <CuriosTiger> ^ this
[00:04:30] * LuisR14 hopes she never said that…
[00:05:16] <CuriosTiger> gneeriiloeepdeer: The action would be described as letting the case expire. The judge's action might be described as dereliction of duty.
[00:05:25] <gneeriiloeepdeer> wodes, it involves corruption, so our judge cannot close it, because to close it he has to argument why, to ground it. THis is more a case of letting it expire, ignoring it, letting the accused go due to a technicality
[00:05:55] <d34df00d> CuriosTiger: ok, thanks! I was curious about the ambiguity between additive and multiplicative interpretation (whether you take X% and add that, or just multiply by X).
[00:06:26] <wodes> gneeriiloeepdeer oh wow.. Good luck with that
[00:06:43] <gneeriiloeepdeer> thx CuriosTiger 
[00:06:43] <CuriosTiger> d34df00d: That ambiguity exists across languages. You can have people say it got 25% bigger and 125% bigger and both will mean the same thing.
[00:07:20] <CuriosTiger> Only one will be mathematically correct, but in general, people don't use language with mathematical precision -- and many people may not understand the difference.
[00:07:27] <LuisR14> hrm, it's become 25% above current limit
[00:08:17] <d34df00d> I'll just hope my readers who care will understand that from the context.
[00:10:28] <wodes> +125% is more than double no?
[00:10:53] <wodes> For example if my stock share is up +100%, my 100€ turned into 200€

[11:32:05] <CuriosTiger> Some plates do both -- like some Texas semi truck plates from the 90s, where the letters and the month/year boxes showing expiration were embossed -- but inside those two boxes, a fixed expiration date would be impressed into the box. Or "debossed". :)

[15:52:57] <AmalLight> if we could be less than 7 kkk we can move  palestine people in another land without problem
[15:53:10] <AmalLight> but humans make too much sex XD
[15:54:24] <kompowiec> statistics in developed countries show the opposite trend

[15:59:39] <AmalLight> kompowiec I think that Palestine people for to be rich and good country have to move in another country , but now it is difficult , every land is already exploited.
[15:59:54] <AmalLight> *another place
[16:00:17] <kompowiec> there are still micronations
[16:00:26] <AmalLight> boomers XD

[16:06:25] <Prutz> I think the prices are ok in Japan.. I mean quality is just amazing
[16:06:36] <amigojapan> I can easily spend 30usd a day with only buying food from the supermarket. I am doing keto
[16:06:48] <Prutz> i have no clue.. my gf does the groceries
[16:06:48] <kompowiec> hard to say, I'm just getting started on creating a home finance tracker

[16:08:58] <AmalLight> amigojapan yes beacouse you are expansive ... It is too much ( 30 a day )
[16:09:01] <Prutz> 70 dollar a week is pretty low 
[16:09:13] <AmalLight> Prutz yes i know
[16:09:30] <amigojapan> AmalLight: I could spend less if I was eating carbs
[16:09:33] <Prutz> think here in the Netherlands we pay 160 dollar?
[16:09:55] <AmalLight> i have more projects so i am trying to save money
[16:09:59] <AmalLight> for the future
[16:11:06] <amigojapan> AmalLight: I suggest you don't judge another country by your own counties standards

[16:13:03] <Prutz> Can't remember the supermarket prices in Italy :P but i thought it was kinda similar as here
[16:13:52] <AmalLight> Prutz with 2k euro every month the standard of life is different
[16:14:25] <AmalLight> Prutz: i know that in Netherlands the salary are good
[16:14:48] <AmalLight> i tried in the past to go there , without success
[16:15:01] <AmalLight> *in past
[16:15:34] <Prutz> house prices are high here though :P

[17:48:07] <CuriosTiger> Cryptography challenges my brain. PKI flat out hurts it.
[17:48:27] <CuriosTiger> Both because of how hard it is to get right, but also because of how badly existing schemes get it wrong.
[17:48:41] <AmalLight> CuriosTiger it is a serious argument ( Cryptography ) , i know
[17:48:51] <CuriosTiger> You lose a root certificate and the whole thing collapses.

[18:37:31] <kompowiec> tbh I would be afraid to write any encryption algorithm
[18:37:33] <TimMc> libsodium in particular seems very solid -- it uses Elliptic Curve cryptography, backed by some very solid parameter choices

[18:39:52] <TimMc> OTP is extremely easy to implement, yes. It's too bad that it's a terrible idea in practice.

[18:42:26] <kompowiec> sorry
[18:42:36] <dTal> ...if you use another encryption protocol to distribute the OTP, that defeats the purpose.

[21:38:34] <TimMc> kompowiec: I have a hard time keeping "te amo" and "te quiero" straight in Spanish.
[21:40:02] <kompowiec> we have such constructions in Polish and I would have no problems learning Spanish. I thought about learning this language btw. but procrastination does its job...
[21:40:33] <TimMc> If I have this right... "te amo" would literally mean "I love you", but is used with a romantic partner; "te quiero" literally means "I want you" (more or less) but is used more lightly, between friends. But it sounds more lusty to me!

[22:43:27] <huf> kompowiec: yeah but that's not how this works
[22:43:45] <TimMc> kompowiec: And Spanish has a bunch of words imported from Arabic, but it's still a Romance language.
[22:44:07] <TimMc> despite the hundreds of years of interchange
[22:44:51] <TimMc> Heck, look at English -- huge amount of Latin-derived words, but it's still Germanic.
