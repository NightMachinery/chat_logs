[00:00:31] <droid3> Ya well the class field over a base field will be algebraic and thus finite so the class group must be finite
[00:01:25] <droid3> ya riv kind of a cool way to prove that class numbers for class groups are always finite by looking at the class field extension number.
[00:02:07] <droid3> But anyway passed that it seems equally hard to work with these fields as opposed to groups.
[00:02:49] <droid3> I guess what i am asking is when is class groups better to work with and when is it better to go with there corresponding class fields

[00:52:25] <[itchyjunk]> apparently sqrt in C cannot be defined continuously. that's what you get sqrt function! i never liked you anyways
[00:52:40] <mh_le> how goes?
[00:55:26] <droid3> To me at the moment i guess the most practical theorem we have to compute on a computer class field / class group stuff is Kronecker weber theorem and working with nth roots of unity and cyclotomic polynomials.
[00:55:56] <Z-module> [itchyjunk]: for any simple path (non-self-intersecting, continuous) starting in the plane at 0 and going to infinity in any way, if P is the image of that, you can define sqrt continuously on C \ P, and it will be holomorphic there.
[00:56:09] <droid3> But the general case of go from class fields to class groups and visa-versa as well as computing them seem very very very tough still.
[00:58:07] <droid3> I even heard that people are trying to generalize class field theory to the nonabelian extension settings yet cohomology theories are failing because there not offering anyway to classify the prime ideal decompositions

[01:33:17] <droid3> But what seems to be your take on it.
[01:34:08] <droid3> zero divisors and not having inverses seems very problematic for doing division algorithms like grobner bases/elimination theory with.

[01:34:53] <droid3> Not i ask the question in a algebraic geometry setting with several variables.
[01:35:50] <droid3> But maybe the best thing to do is to first thinking about it in the setting of single variable linear systems aka Linear algebra as a special case then move up to algebraic geometry settings.

[11:32:58] <Codaraxis> Could someone check my thinking on this? If you earn money at a rate of x, have two technologies with costs A and B that independently provide an increase of a and b, respectively, to the earning rate, then the minimum times necessary to purchase both is: (A/x) + B/(x+a)  (A first then B) and (B/x) + A/(x+b) (B first then A). Correct?

[11:42:53] <Codaraxis> W, Fair enough. I started out with an optimization problem. I have an earning rate and I have a set of technologies. Each technology has an associated cost and an amount by which it increases the earning rate. Each time a unit of a technology is purchased, the cost of that technology increases but the amount by which it increases the earning rate does not.

[11:45:37] <Codaraxis> Was thinking about it a few different ways until I realized that it could be simplified to a bunch of either-or choices. Figure out the time to obtain both starting with one and then the other. Collect this lit for all possible n=2 combinations. Then go with the smallest.
[11:45:46] <Codaraxis> Recompute when the price of the technology goes up.

[13:39:50] <W> that's just beyond my knowledge unfortunately
[13:39:51] <Gurkenglas> Let ((A B) (C D)) be 4 blocks of a submatrix; the mutual information is basically det(A)*det(B)/det((A B) (C D))

[13:41:33] <W> speaking of decompositions though, is there a "normal Jordan normal form" that picks a canonical Jordan normal form? E.g. in terms of largest block first, by eigenvalue, etc?
[13:42:55] <Gurkenglas> You could say I'm hierarchically clustering rows by how much they aren't orthogonal.
[13:44:49] <Gurkenglas> Is one of the compositions particularly helpful for calculating determinants of submatrices? By the way, my matrix has shape about 8000x8000 and was calculated as the product of a matrix ~8000x100 with its own transpose.

[13:51:27] <cadmio> Hello
[13:51:45] <int-e> But yeah, no clue. Intuitively the usual matrix decompositions don't /feel/ helpful for this at all... because they change bases, but this problem seems all about not doing that
[13:52:38] <cadmio> I've to count the number of distinct bracelets you can form with 2 yellow and 2 green beads
[13:53:40] <cadmio> using the Burnside theorem I was considering D_4 and I calculated in total 4!/2!*2! = 6 distinct permutations of the beads
[13:53:41] <W> cadmio, so, basically, a verification that you understand what "bracelet" means?

[14:07:46] <savask> W: LADR being "linear algebra done right"?
[14:08:03] <W> yeah
[14:11:01] <savask> It's funny how LADR puts determinants in the end, while here they sometimes start with determinants even before vector spaces or any theory of matrices
[14:11:39] <Fangs> idk how it's funny, the book is literally written with that goal in mind

[14:13:25] <cadmio> I was saying "id fixes all permutations so |X_id| = 6, rotations none" and I think that reflections fix 2 configurations
[14:13:50] <cadmio> but these numbers don't add up

[14:16:47] <W> independent of the goals of LADR I think it's a very well written and pedagogic book on linear algebra; the exercises especially are excellent, pulling in and reinforcing learning from previous chapters
[14:16:54] <int-e> (it's also kind of dangerous to lump the reflections together, since there are two different types of those)
[14:17:18] <cadmio> so it should be 2 permutations fixed by all the axes
[14:17:36] <savask> Fangs: The course I'm TAing for now starts with vector spaces, rank, transvections etc and gives determinants next (approx. in the middle of first semester), while the course I had when I was a student started with permutations and determinant
[14:17:47] <int-e> cadmio: what you've said covers 5 out of the 8 elements of D_4.
[14:18:00] <Fangs> W: its a really good book, and not having determinants forces you to think about these ideas differently
[14:18:18] <Fangs> (downside though, it doesn't teach you much how to do numerical stuff)
[14:18:46] <Fangs> savask: I think Axler would've skipped determinants all together if they could get away with it, again, going against the grain
[14:19:08] <W> perfect for me, the only thing I've used linear algebra for before this is numerical stuff, specifically graphics and its transformations :)
[14:19:08] <Fangs> he doesn't do much of matrices too I think
[14:19:32] <Fangs> I think everyone should do both styles (and marry them together)
[14:20:23] <W> it does mean that sometimes I insert the concepts of the book into a graphical context, specifically Euclidean low-dimension vector spaces, but the book is good about occasionally throwing in stuff like vector spaces of functions to correct my misconceptions
[14:22:05] <cadmio> int-e: I got this 1/8 * [6 (id) + 0 + 0 + 0 (rotations)+ 4*2 (reflections)] = 14/8 which is wrong

[19:11:03] <Z-module> [itchyjunk]:  log doesn't show up here -- that's for going backwards.  If you define Arg (principal arg) as being the value in [0, 2pi), then  Log: C^* ->  R x [0,2pi)     defined by Log(z) = ln(|z|) + i Arg(z)    is the inverse of exp where we use only R x [0, 2pi)  for the domain of exp.

[19:12:49] <[itchyjunk]> i know 2pi is missing but doesn't feel like anyhting is missing..
[19:13:34] <Z-module> [itchyjunk]: yeah, because of those i 2pi n things, you see that exp actually assumes each nonzero complex value infinitely often (countably infinitely). This is very general: If g is any non-polynomial entire function, then g assumes all complex values countably infinitely often, with one possible exception z_0 that g can possibly assume never or just finitely often. For g = exp, this z_0 is 0 (never a value of exp).

[19:17:24] <Z-module> entire functions are either:  (1) a constant function, so this assume some single value uncountably often and no other values at all;  (2) a nonconstant polynomial of degree n >= 1, and these assume every complex value at most n times each;  (3) not a polynomial (a so-called transcendental function), and these assume every value countably infinitely often, with maybe one exception.

But compositions of entire functions are entire (a fairly easy lemma), and we know by Picard and the algebraic completeness of C that nonconstant entire functions assume all complex values with at most one exception. So g being never 0 and never 1 means g actually is constant, so  1 =
