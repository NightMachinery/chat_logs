[01:52:22] <FromGitter> <golanv:tchncs.de> So I switched distros (Fedora to Gentoo with emacs 27.2) and now when I try to load magit status, if fails and displays a "Selecting deleted buffer" message.  Does anyone know what this means?
[01:59:18] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> upstream bug
[01:59:32] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> turn on debug-on-error. what do you see?
[02:00:00] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> I just sent a patch to org-mode for a bug with the same error https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-orgmode/2022-02/msg00148.html
[02:09:20] <FromGitter> <golanv:tchncs.de> Ah...a lot of output I don't quite follow...
[02:09:39] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> reproduce and post it
[02:13:25] <FromGitter> <golanv:tchncs.de> https://dpaste.com/FV6D6AQ3K
[02:30:39] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> how did you reporduce it?
[02:30:54] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> this definitely is an upstream bug
[02:31:54] <FromGitter> <golanv:tchncs.de> SPC g s
[02:33:51] <FromGitter> <golanv:tchncs.de> I'm wondering if it isn't related somehow to some of the USE flags (compile options) I selected when I built Emacs.  My configuration worked without issue on Fedora is running the same version of Emacs.  I'll tinker with my build options and see if that has any affect.
[02:40:00] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> :(

[02:41:19] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> why do you switch to gentoo
[02:43:08] <FromGitter> <golanv:tchncs.de> I missed it really.  I used it for a long time several years back.  It's a bear to install, but has a great package manager and a huge package selection.
[02:46:07] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> arch has a good package selection. it's basically python of Linux distribution nowadays
[02:48:08] <FromGitter> <golanv:tchncs.de> I know Arch is popular.  I have yet to try it.  The Arch documentation wiki is fantastic though.
[02:48:31] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> if package selection is not a concern, currently fedora is one of the best in Linux.
[02:49:01] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> silverblue is awesome
[02:53:23] <FromGitter> <golanv:tchncs.de> Okay, it looks like deleting ~/.emacs.d/elpa and ~/.emacs.d/.cache got it working, as per https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/issues/8729#issuecomment-783364415
[02:54:41] <FromGitter> <golanv:tchncs.de> I used Fedora as my primary distro for the past....5 years maybe.  I like it quite a bit overall.  It's very well put together and the packaging quality is very high.  SELinux done right is a nice bonus also.
[02:56:23] <FromGitter> <golanv:tchncs.de> It's missing a few packages here and there....I would like something slightly more stable...."stable" as in old, not "stable" as in not crashy (it's very not-crashy).  Those are minor things though.
[02:58:23] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> there's something not making sense in the workaround here...
[02:59:16] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> deleting elpa directory just force Emacs to re-download packages, which should not make difference
[02:59:29] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> (unless you don't live in North America)
[03:00:45] <FromGitter> <golanv:tchncs.de> Sorry, I did get a message I should have made note of.  Emacs rebuild SQLite?
[03:01:10] <FromGitter> <golanv:tchncs.de> Which reminded me of this: https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs/issues/4311

[23:18:18] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> @golanv:tchncs.de Inspired by the post  you mentioned earlier, I removed `emacssql` and reinstalled it. Now `magit` works much faster ...
[23:18:56] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> Before, a simple `git commit` taakes almost half minutes in `magit`...
[23:45:02] <FromGitter> <golanv:tchncs.de> Interesting.  A large local db slowed things down?
