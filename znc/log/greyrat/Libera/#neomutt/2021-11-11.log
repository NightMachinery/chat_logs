[17:14:38] <flatcap> sorry, not really.  how are you using proton mail?  I understand there's a bridge/server running locally...
[17:14:52] <th0rne> Yeah.
[17:14:57] <th0rne> That's correct,
[17:15:00] <flatcap> do you connect to it using IMAP, or use offlineimap/mbsync/isync
[17:15:16] <flatcap> ok.  that's worrying
[17:16:04] <flatcap> we'd seem problems on notmuch folders, but they do some strange things behind the scenes
[17:16:52] <th0rne> Maybe I'll try clearing the cache?
[17:17:12] <flatcap> what we really need is a "reproducer".  a set of instructions that reliably reproduces the bug
[17:17:31] <flatcap> er... I don't think it'll make a difference, but it won't hurt to do it
[17:19:55] <th0rne> Well, like right now, the top four emails in neomutt inbox were sent on Nov 11, Nov 11, Sep 15, and Nov 10.
[17:20:14] <th0rne> 1, 2, and 4 are the correct email.
[17:20:57] <th0rne> Opening the third email does in fact open an email from Sep 15, but in the inbox it uses the sender and title of a message that came on Nov 10.
[17:22:23] * flatcap is confused (by the behaviour, not the explanation)
[17:23:13] <flatcap> please can you try something...
[17:23:21] <th0rne> So I guess like the third email uses the date and contents of the 189th email.
[17:23:50] <flatcap> 'o' <sort> the emails by some other field, then <sort> them back the original way
[17:23:56] <flatcap> then have a look at emails 1-4
[17:25:28] <th0rne> If I do 'od', it sorts them by date in reverse, but how to go back?
[17:25:51] <th0rne> I don't see a "reverse" in the sort options.
[17:25:59] <th0rne> Or in the choices.
[17:26:28] <th0rne> If I do 'od' again, it doesn't chance, they're still ordered by date with the oldest first (as opposed to the newest).
[17:27:10] <th0rne> Date with the newest first is "the original way".
[17:27:14] <flatcap> O <sort-reverse>
[17:28:25] <th0rne> If I do 'Od', they seem correct. At least the third one is now correct.
[17:28:31] <th0rne> Or all the newest ones.
[17:28:53] <flatcap> ok, thanks.  that's a bit a clue.  a small step forward :-)
[17:29:07] <th0rne> But if I restart neomutt the 3rd email is messed up again.
[17:30:08] <flatcap> oh, that's interesting
[17:30:24] <th0rne> Maybe I can specify Od as the default sort in the rc file?
[17:30:43] <th0rne> Oh no, it is already: set sort="reverse-date-received"
[17:31:46] <cache_return> flatcap: Okay, I can't remember how to get a more informative backtrace than this: http://sprunge.us/yYk44W
[17:31:50] <th0rne> Is it possible to do it twice? 'set sort="reverse-date-received;reverse-date-received"' or something like that?
[17:32:35] <cache_return> I have to do something after 'thread apply all bt' right?
[17:33:05] <flatcap> cache_return: hehe, oh yeah very useful :-)
[17:33:38] <flatcap> cache_return: you'll need the debugging symbols to get more info
[17:33:44] <cache_return> ah
[17:34:11] <flatcap> if you didn't build neomutt yourself, there's probably a neomutt-debug (or similar) package that you can install
[17:35:25] <flatcap> th0rne: neomutt accepts multiple config setting, e.g.   set sort="reverse-date-received" sort="reverse-date-received"
[17:35:52] <cache_return> flatcap: not for arch
[17:35:52] <flatcap> but that may not trigger a refresh
[17:37:26] <flatcap> an altenative is,   macro index <f5> '<enter-command>set sort="ONE"<enter><enter-command>set sort="TWO"<enter>'
[17:38:17] <flatcap> cache_return: oh, arch builds things, doesn't it.  that means there's probabaly an install option that'll save the symbols

[17:38:21] * flatcap is guessing wildly
[17:38:50] <cache_return> I'll figure it out
[17:38:56] <flatcap> th0rne: how technical are you?  have you built your own neomutt, before?
[17:39:07] <th0rne> I have not, no. But I'm pretty technical.
[17:39:11] <th0rne> I'd say.
[17:40:07] <flatcap> th0rne: as your problem is repeatable, I'm tempted to suggest a `git bisect` of the code
[17:40:43] <flatcap> it'll involve quite a few builds and tests, but it could identify when neomutt broke
[17:41:39] <th0rne> Although, might be bug with proton, instead, I guess?
[17:41:57] <th0rne> Although, I guess not, since it is in fact able to sort them?
[17:43:06] <flatcap> neomutt stores two lists for the emails.  a list of pointers to the emails and a sorted/limited list
[17:43:32] <th0rne> Might deleting the cache help? I don't lose anything that way, right?
[17:43:49] <flatcap> yes, deleting the cache is safe
[17:43:58] <flatcap> give it a try
[17:44:01] <th0rne> Ok.

[18:05:57] <cache_return> So it was magenta, but crashes when changing to blue. I'm not really sure how to read these, but is it parsing "~N" instead of "color index blue default ~N" from the drop in file?

[18:49:41] <cache_return> It no longer crashes, but the color settings have no effect: everything is just magenta
[18:50:08] <cache_return> Well, not exactly: the basic color settings still work, but not the ~N one
[18:51:03] <cache_return> like I have 'color sidebar_new blue default' and that works
[18:51:16] <cache_return> wait
[18:52:24] <cache_return> sorry, it's fixed
[18:52:43] <cache_return> I had changed the drop in file to see if the colors I was using were the problem
[18:52:57] <cache_return> seems fixed in devel/index

[23:40:03] <ckardaris> When you are using a mailto link (or passing an email-to-compose-to as an argument in general), upon opening neomutt, you are asked to edit it? Does that make sense? Should we make the necessary changes to go straight into subject field, or if provided, straight to email composition? It has always been frustrating to me and I don't see a real use case, since you can always edit after composing.
[23:40:58] <ckardaris> If you pass the subject as an argument it does not enter the subject edit code
[23:41:59] <ckardaris> We should be able to do "neomutt random@random.con -s Random" and go straight into the editor
[23:43:54] <keir> it makes sense to me. i don't see sense in writing a subject before i've written the email itself
[23:49:21] <ckardaris> This patch would affect any time that the sender is already known at the time of beginning the new mail process. For example when you compose a new mail to the sender of an e-mail (compose-to-sender), then the same input dialog opens. Maybe in that case it makes sense to have it, because it could have been opened by accident. Let me know what you think and I could provide the patch soon, because I
[23:49:22] <ckardaris> am already checking those parts of the codebase.
