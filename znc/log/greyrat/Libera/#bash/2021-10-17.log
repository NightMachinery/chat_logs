[07:25:45] <pj> jensen: ~/bin at the end of your path is probably safer, but I don't really consider it much of a security issue to put it at the beginning.  Consider that someone who can write to ~/bin can likely also modify your .bashrc and thus change the PATH anyways, or just write a function to .bashrc that can replace sudo or something else.  In other words, if they can write stuff as your user you've already lost.
[07:26:18] <pj> just make sure that the permissions on ~/bin only allow the user to write to it (700 is good).
[07:27:09] <Friithian> if someone can put something in ~/bin, you're screwed anyways

[18:25:00] <thebombzen> is it a bad idea to use aliases in shell scripts for some reason, or is it considered a useful tool?
[18:25:33] <izabera> It's a bad idea if you have to ask the question
[18:25:53] <thebombzen> not sure what that means
[18:26:12] <thebombzen> like, I try it, and it works, but I'm wondering if there's a caveat I haven't thought of
[18:26:20] <userdocs> why do you want to do that?
[18:26:37] <phy1729> I'd argue aliases are a bad idea in general
[18:26:42] <thebombzen> same code dupliation. I have a network script that calls timeout a number of times with the same arguments
[18:26:51] <thebombzen> I'm thinking of doing something like this: alias timeout='timeout --signal=TERM --kill-after=2.0s 1.0s'
[18:26:52] <userdocs> almsot always, the reason a person thinks they need to do something is th apart that needs explaining
[18:26:52] <phy1729> Use a function
[18:27:17] <thebombzen> so, something like: _timeout() { timeout --signal=TERM --kill-after=2.0s 1.0s "$@" }
[18:27:19] <thebombzen> is that preferred?

[19:04:58] <phogg> that doesn't work with aliases either, so you're kind of stuck either way
[19:05:29] <emanuele6> you can always redefine a function, but afair `ls --color=auto --color=off` will use color=off

[20:43:25] <TRS> ok
[20:45:54] <earnestly> thebombzen: Yeah, always think cleverly about $@.  E.g. for loops have "two" copies of $@ allowing you to do things like this: https://0x0.st/-kDN.sh
[20:46:09] <earnestly> And of course, functions have their own $@
[20:46:39] <ormaaj> To quote a command to be eval'd you just add an extra layer of quotes / escapes. There is no possible way to make field splitting bullet-proof in all cases.
[20:46:57] <earnestly> That is, in a for loop the $@ will expand into a list which is iterated over.  You can then build a new $@ without affecting the list the for loop just built
[20:47:51] <earnestly> thebombzen: You can also carry another array inside $@, e.g. https://0x0.st/-kDb.sh

[20:58:22] <earnestly> There is also a good need for coverage of pitfalls, something all languages have (and I wish as many documented them as well as wooledge)

[21:02:33] <hyrcanus> that is important for me
[21:02:41] <ormaaj> Wouldn't `rm -rd` work? Personally i'd just go with the `find -exec +` however.
[21:02:52] <c_89> emanuele6 `find ${root_path} -depth -type d -empty -exec rmdir {} +` is more safe for special characters?

[21:04:15] <greybot> `find "$dir" -type f' is problematic if $dir starts with '-'; a solution is to use `find "${dir/#-/./-}" -type f' (i.e. prepend './' to $dir only if $dir begins with '-')
[21:04:24] <ormaaj> er i guess i'm thinking rmdir actually with nonstandard options

[22:57:39] * neshpion controls all the characters
[22:57:40] <Guest70> kurahaupo, thanks. I mean CAN indeed. It makes the Mikrotik device enter the safe mode (i.e. discards settings on unexpected disconnect). One more question: How can I concatenate other variables after that ANSI escape string?
[22:57:52] <Guest70> kurahaupo, oh ok
[22:58:19] <kurahaupo> A control character is by definition a single byte, and therefore not a sequence

[23:02:51] <dez__> Hey I'm wondering if anyone can help me with a question i'm stuck on for an assignment. The question is: How can you create a file name -i? How can you remove a file name -i?
[23:04:06] <twkm> easily, provide a directory name too, relative or absolute.
[23:04:35] <twkm> alternatively you can tell some utilities to stop processing options.
[23:04:41] <dez__> oooooh okay i'll try that. Thanks for the quick response
[23:04:55] <kurahaupo> Guest70: In relation to serial communications, including ssh, "ANSI" is shorthand for ECMA-48; ISO/IEC 6429; FIPS 86; ANSI X3.64; JIS X 0211

[23:05:23] <kurahaupo> Guest70: "\n" does not do what you want
[23:05:50] <cfaber> Does anyone have any clever scripts that can load / consolidate / save history from multiple concurrent sessions?
[23:05:59] <twkm> "ansi c" in relation to "escape" makes sense.  dropping the "c" makes it weird.
[23:06:28] <kurahaupo> cfaber: I keep a separate history file for each tty
[23:06:50] <cfaber> doesn't that make it difficult finding the right thing you're looking for?
[23:07:18] <Guest70> kurahaupo: I am not getting anything back using the -tt argument and <<<, is that to be expected?
[23:07:36] <Guest70> It only echos the stuff I send to the device.
[23:07:40] <twkm> depends on the other end.
[23:08:25] <kurahaupo> cfaber: My history files are named for the timestamp, tty, and hostname. I can reload the most recent ones at login
[23:09:47] <kurahaupo> Guest70: you can either send everything in the <<< here string, or interactively. Combining is much trickier
[23:10:19] <cfaber> Hm.. I think it could probably consolidate all of my sessions using a blocking script as part of the prompt command that appends history and reloads it everytime
[23:10:39] <cfaber> that could possibly block all of my terminals if the lock is held to long, but I don't think it would be that big of deal
[23:10:51] <kurahaupo> ssh -tt forces allocation of a tty on the server, even if stdin is not a tty on the client
[23:11:15] <cfaber> was hoping someone had already figured this out already =)

[23:16:20] <twkm> you probably want cr not nl.
[23:16:39] <Guest70> Oh an $nl after $can should also not be necessary.
[23:17:14] <cfaber> twb: that might be useful as well but would still leave you trying to find the previous commands
[23:17:23] <cfaber> twkm even
[23:17:54] <cfaber> this stems from having to reboot my system recently, and losing command history for a copy I was working on because of the last writer problem
[23:17:59] <twkm> aren't the commands you are looking for usually related to the project/directory you are in?
[23:18:08] <Guest70> cr=$'\r\n'
[23:18:14] <twkm> no, just cr.
[23:18:43] <cfaber> twkm: it's a mixed bag
[23:19:34] <cfaber> and since I regularly drink from the ^r well, it doesn't really matter, I just need to know 'the rsync command I used a while back'
[23:19:48] <Guest70> twkm, still not working with cr=$'\r' and <<<"$can/system identity set name=Test$cr$can"
[23:20:00] <cfaber> ^r rsync; ^r^r .. ah here it is
[23:21:36] <twkm> so search the pile for the pearl.  okay, so you want history commands in your PROMPT_COMMAND.
[23:21:51] <cfaber> basically
[23:22:00] <cfaber> but consolidated across all of my terminals
[23:22:43] <cfaber> like I said, I think using PROMPT_COMMAND and pointing it to a "history" like (or hacked up history) command that performs the locking and syncing on each command stroke could work
[23:23:46] <twkm> PROMPT_COMMAND doesn't run for every key pressed.
