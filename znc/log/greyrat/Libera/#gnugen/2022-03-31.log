[01:04:32] <afontain[m]> Ah yeah I saw that one
[01:05:01] <afontain[m]> I've settled for setting TMOUT=300 instead
[01:10:25] <Orbstheorem> I like the idea of that for a server with a console.
[01:11:32] <artectrex[m]> am I missing something? I have not seen slimefoot talk for a while
[01:11:57] <artectrex[m]> * a while, not sure what afontain is settling for ðŸ™ˆ
[01:12:46] <Orbstheorem> People move on, I wouldn't be surprised.
[01:13:17] <Orbstheorem> You're missing a discussion I had with tinu about 6 years ago.
[01:13:27] <artectrex[m]> oh okay ^^'
[01:14:44] <artectrex[m]> I didn't see the telegram bridge's messages for a while because I muted it to get rid of its status indicator moving all the time
[01:15:12] <artectrex[m]> so a bit paranoid about bridge people (that sounds like a euphemism for homeless people xD) talking
[01:17:05] <typedef[m]> Guess bridge people are homeserver-less

[12:14:41] <afontain[m]> Â« **[A Printer Company Is Putting DRM in Paper Now](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2022/02/worst-timeline-printer-company-putting-drm-paper-now)**
[12:14:41] <afontain[m]> Printer companies have long profited from being the exclusive sellers of ink or toner for their own machines. Now, label maker Dymo is installing hardware in their printers to ensure that customers can only print on paper they sell. Â»
[12:14:51] <afontain[m]> :(
[12:20:03] <Orbstheorem> WTF...
[12:21:31] <afontain[m]> I'm hoping people don't buy this and the company gets out of business
[12:22:40] <afontain[m]> like, I'm hoping it goes out of business because their brand would be damaged by this
[12:26:13] <LucasCrijns[m]> Fortunately, we also have companies like Epson, that sell printers with ink reservoirs. They literally cannot do DRM on that
[12:26:25] * Orbstheorem > <@crijns:gnugen.ch> Fortunately, we also have companies like Epson, that sell printers with ink reservoirs. They literally cannot do DRM on that
[12:26:25] * Orbstheorem didn't know that.
[12:27:00] <LucasCrijns[m]> Their printers are quite nice and work with open source drivers
[12:27:19] <LucasCrijns[m]> Don't want to advertise here, but it is always better than the hassle with hplip or something
[12:27:30] <jonas[m]> and the ink they ship initially with the printer actually last for 2 years for a moderate use
[12:28:45] <LucasCrijns[m]> True that, it is really amazing. After using that printer, it really makes me wonder how people put up with the proprietary cartridges of other printer companies. I mean, why does a cartridge need a chip in it?
[12:30:09] <jonas[m]> also why cartridges with a few milliliters of ink if you can have a whole bottle containing much more ink in way less plastic waste
[12:30:58] <LucasCrijns[m]> Exactly
[12:34:03] <Orbstheorem> <LucasCrijns[m]> "Don't want to advertise here..." <- hplib has gotten **much** better these years.
[12:34:38] <Orbstheorem> On gnome, you don't even need to add the printer.
[12:34:48] <Orbstheorem> Just hit print and it is automagically available.
[12:37:07] <LucasCrijns[m]> That's nice, I didn't know about that improvement. Good to see there is progress
[12:49:49] <afontain[m]> Yes!
[12:50:58] <afontain[m]> (for ink reservoirs instead of cardridges)
[13:31:17] <Orbstheorem> ddg doesn't work on ipv6 only :(
[13:31:25] <Orbstheorem> sparrowhawk: What search engine do you use?
[13:31:45] <Orbstheorem> support.mozilla.org doesn't work on ipv6-only either :/
[13:31:51] <sparrowhawk[m]> Orbstheorem: I use ddg
[13:32:15] <sparrowhawk[m]> Which is also useful to debug NAT64 and DNS64 ðŸ¤£
[13:32:59] <Orbstheorem> Rah...
[13:33:05] <Orbstheorem> I assume the ones you use are private?
[13:33:32] * Orbstheorem 's ipv4 routing seems to be broken and has no time to fix it...
[13:34:21] <Orbstheorem> Hotspot it is...
[13:34:32] <sparrowhawk[m]> Orbstheorem: Yes...

[22:00:50] * ayekat tries to scrape together the piece of memory for this
[22:03:17] <ayekat> ok yeah, I vaguely remember discussing something like that, but I totally forgot the context ^^'
[22:08:57] <Orbstheorem> exec or not exec startx.
[22:10:01] <Orbstheorem> I think your graphical session did not fully prevent a user from getting a shell when it was locked.
[22:10:25] <Orbstheorem> Right, xtrlock didn't disable sysrq, so you could crash the graphical session.
[22:10:37] <ayekat> ah yes - although... I believe it was more about doing `startx & exit` (which is no longer possible because startx/xinit/X/whatever requires the TTY to be "active" or something, so now I just do `exec startx`)
[22:11:26] <ayekat> something with sysqr+alt+u, no?
[22:11:37] <ayekat> *sysrq
[22:12:07] <Orbstheorem> Rather `e`
[22:12:13] <Orbstheorem> > Send the SIGTERM signal to all processes except init (PID 1) 
[22:12:49] <Orbstheorem> SIGTERM on a shell won't kill it, but if the underlying process dies you get back the shell.
[22:13:22] <Orbstheorem> `startx & exit` should exit the shell.
[22:13:37] <Orbstheorem> But I believe you had something different.
[22:14:03] <ayekat> I think I used to do `startx & exit`, but I might misremember ^^'
[22:14:17] <ayekat> but yeah, just plain `startx` is certainly not smart, security-wise
[22:15:02] <Orbstheorem> I wonder, do you still use systemd?
[22:15:25] <ayekat> yeah - still happy with it :-)
[22:16:57] <Orbstheorem> Do you use an ssh-agent ?
[22:17:02] <ayekat> (afk cooking)
[22:17:04] <Orbstheorem> Is it start by a systemd-user service?
[22:17:11] <Orbstheorem> s/start/started/
[22:18:03] <Orbstheorem> My ssh agent is set to request confirmation before signing; but I would really like to use my fingerprint reader to acquiesce instead of 'simply pressing return'.
[22:19:28] <Orbstheorem> A trivial implementation would replace ssh-askpass with something calling fprintd::verify through dbus (or even simply `fprintd-verify -f any`).
[22:20:08] <Orbstheorem> But somehow I got confused and am now thinking that perhaps a pam service may be more suitable.
