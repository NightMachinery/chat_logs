[23:37:00] <lantech19446> ok if neither <p> nor <br> can be children of <ul> how do I make a break in my list?
[23:38:53] <lantech19446> looks like i gotta do it in css
[23:40:32] <bin> lantech19446: the only thing that can be a child of ul is li and li can contain anything
[23:41:03] <lantech19446> yep just added a class called break and i'll just use css to add some padding
[23:42:25] <bin> :)
[23:43:26] <lantech19446> most of the validation issues i'm having come from the last dev fortunately but some of them i understand why he did it the way he did i'm just being anal about trying to write the best cleanest code i can
[23:46:47] <lantech19446> bin: any idea why it's saying that target="_new" is a bad value on an a tag?
[23:46:47] <lantech19446> I guess it doesn't need the _?
[23:48:44] <bin> target="_blank"
[23:49:32] <lantech19446> that will open a new page when they click on the link?
[23:50:01] <bin> new tab or window depending on their brwoser settings
[23:50:31] <lantech19446> ok
[23:51:07] <bin> but these days that's considered bad practice
[23:51:18] <bin> as it should be up to the user to determine if they want something to open in a new place or not
[23:51:30] <lantech19446> ok I can go with that
[23:52:16] <bin> personally I think it depends on the situation. It drives me crazy when webapps open links in the same tab because if i accidentally left click instead of middle click it's interruptive, however my opinion doesn't really matter to best practice i guess.
[23:52:22] <bin> it's a point of contention though
[23:53:24] <lantech19446> ok
[23:54:02] <lantech19446> i'm getting a weird error telling me I have an open element in between my blockquote too and i don't so I guess i'll see if it gets anymore specific when I've removed the other errors
