[03:45:22] <Klinda> if you train a bot you have to be aware of racism and a lot of stuffs humans talk
[03:45:47] <Klinda> imagine you train on facebook comments
[03:45:48] <Klinda> auauahua
[03:45:51] <Klinda> what a disaster
[03:49:13] <causative> if you have a model that is a product of factors, like x*y, the derivative doesn't seem like a great way to optimize it. It is better - more natural - to twiddle the various factors by a certain percentage, so that if a factor is initially larger you would make larger adjustments to it
[03:49:34] <causative> but gradient descent says the precise opposite - the smaller the factor, the larger the adjustments
[03:52:09] <causative> e.g. if x = 0.1, y=10, then gradient descent suggests making a large change to x and a small change to y if you wish to adjust the value of x*y
[03:52:29] <causative> instead of the more natural small change to x and large change to y
[03:53:04] <HuntsMan> well there are multiple ways to define a gradient... for example, the natural gradient
[03:56:10] *** Joins: sinaowolabi (~SinaOwola@160.152.171.207)
[03:58:22] <causative> I'd be interested in a way to define a gradient that ends up saying, to increase x*y by 10% when x is initially 0.1 and y is initially 10, increase both x and y by a factor of sqrt(1.1)
[03:58:56] <HuntsMan> that's not how the gradient works
[03:59:04] <HuntsMan> there are a lot other optimization algorithms that you might like
[03:59:17] <causative> well, I'd be interested in a way to define *something* that works that way, vaguely like a gradient
