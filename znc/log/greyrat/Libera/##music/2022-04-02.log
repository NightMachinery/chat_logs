[00:40:21] <morlog> nice

[00:43:57] <sublim20> hoooooly shit
[00:44:34] <MusicalDillo> it's unlikely to pass the Senate
[00:44:34] <sublim20> all the people who've been betting on the 'im gonna open a pot shop / store' are about to get fucked 
[00:45:13] <MusicalDillo> and they're 'decriminalizing', not legalizing
[00:45:21] <sublim20> online transactions would be valid, and one could mail it.   prices would crash over not
[00:45:27] <sublim20> *over NIGHT
[00:45:34] <MusicalDillo> legalizing would be like Colorado which sells and taxes it in stores
[00:45:52] <MusicalDillo> like alcohol 
[00:46:07] <sublim20> no, the feds
[00:46:23] <sublim20> mailing it and banking are the current issues federally
[00:46:32] <sublim20> state wise varies
[00:46:35] <MusicalDillo> What the House has done is pass a bill which simply takes it off the list of illegal substances
[00:46:48] <MusicalDillo> right, it's still up to the States
[00:47:12] <sublim20> yeah, but what im saying is, if the usps starts mailing it
[00:47:21] <MusicalDillo> and Texas isn't likely to make ti legal or decriminalize anytime soon
[00:47:30] <sublim20> so many people here are about to get fucked
[00:47:54] <MusicalDillo> *make it
[00:47:58] <sublim20> yeah sure, i could go to a store and buy an ounce for 300, or i could order an ounce online for like 50
[00:48:31] <MusicalDillo> but they couldn't deliver it to States like Texas
[00:48:36] <sublim20> true
[00:48:39] <sublim20> but here in ny
[00:48:42] <sublim20> oh boy
[00:48:43] <MusicalDillo> however I see what you're saying
[00:48:58] <sublim20> they recently did like a 150 million or some shit 
[00:49:12] <sublim20> land deal, for the sole purpose of growing pot
[00:49:12] <MusicalDillo> anyway, not going to happen because it won't likely pass the Senate
[00:50:01] <sublim20> lemme guess, all democrats vote yes (except the conniving lesbo fraud)
[00:50:22] <sublim20> and all republicans suck mcconnels shrinkled old dick and vote no
[00:50:47] <sublim20> well, the guys can, the woman will just have to watch.  (thats the way mcconnel prefers it)'
[00:51:50] <sublim20> but man, i hope this passes and watch schaedenfraude
