[17:19:35] <xaltsc> Hey, is it possible to parse HTML (4 or 5, not! XHTML) with sxml,ssax ? A trivial application doesn't work since HTML is not strictly xml
[17:21:26] <amazigh> it works most of the time
[17:22:07] <amazigh> I know there is a bug in sxml, but I have no proofs yet.
[17:23:04] <xaltsc> amazigh: this https://paste.debian.net/1217472/ doesn't work with gauche documentation for instance :(
[17:23:28] <xaltsc> (From what I understand, because <link>s are not closed.
[17:23:30] <xaltsc> )
[17:23:36] <amazigh> oh sorry, I read htmlprag.
[17:23:41] <amazigh> htmlprag works most of the time.
[17:24:02] <amazigh> I never tried to read html with sxml
[17:25:04] <amazigh> I ported the code to chez, I only had to replace @ with * because @ is special with chez reader or something
[17:26:14] <amazigh> xaltsc: you can parse with htmlprag, and the feed that s-expr to sxpath, it should work as expected... but I never tried it myself with chez.
[17:26:40] <amazigh> with guile which includes sxpath in the stdlib, and htmlprag as a library both work together so I guess you can make it work together with gauche

[17:29:10] <xaltsc> amazigh: Is it poorly documented or is my browser malfunctionning ?
[17:31:21] <amazigh> There is many differences... between gauche and guile there isn't as much differences afaict except the license. There is more differences between guile and chez, and gauche and chibi.
[17:31:34] <amazigh> Gauche should have better (R7RS) support
[17:32:08] <amazigh> xaltsc: what documentation is missing?
[17:33:50] <amazigh> I started to think to map differences between implementations, but I have to admit wingo's post on the subject is still a reference

[17:37:12] <amazigh> regarding the choice of a scheme, it might more insightful to ask why one choose a particular scheme implementation.
[17:38:27] <amazigh> I use Chez, because it is 0) mostly Scheme code, 1) It is fast or the fastest 2) It is stable
[17:39:05] <xaltsc> tbh I mostly use Gauche because I was told so here, since I mostly write scripts, but I don't really know why
[17:39:20] <amazigh> also 3) it has great C FFI that only requires to write Scheme code
[17:40:05] <amazigh> re 0) the implementation is mostly Scheme code

[17:48:03] <amazigh> idk whether chicken is implementation minimal, it has many libraries that is what I meant with "vast amount of libraries"
[17:49:27] <amazigh> the only problem I have with chicken, and I got leads on how to solve it but did not take the required care, is how to work with my own libraries and compile all the things with one command; there is way, but last time I checked it was not the default behavior.

[21:17:19] <wasamasa> xaltsc: at some point you need to decide whether you want minimalism and can live without a library for all the things or not
[21:18:41] <wasamasa> I use http://wiki.call-cc.org/eggref/5/html-parser for the task
[21:18:47] <wasamasa> which is most likely available for chibi
[21:19:32] <wasamasa> yup: http://snow-fort.org/s/gmail.com/alexshinn/chibi/html-parser/0.5.7/index.html
[21:20:04] <wasamasa> as for more lazy/intuitive compile behavior
[21:20:12] <wasamasa> https://wiki.call-cc.org/eggref/5/csm is a thing
[21:20:52] <wasamasa> amazigh: ^
[21:21:10] <wasamasa> xaltsc: no matter what implementation you pick though, expect to write your own solutions at some point

[22:52:24] <jcowan> Can someone check https://www.reddit.com/r/scheme/comments/qd3xft/voting_is_open_on_the_r7rs_yellow_edition_ballot/ and see if it is visible? It's my post, but it got marked spam.
[22:52:52] <jcowan> I rewrote it, but I don't know if that mattered.
[22:53:11] <lampilelo> "Sorry, this post was removed by Reddit's spam filters.""
[22:53:21] <jcowan> yah, I was afraid of that
[22:54:09] <lampilelo> so why was it flagged?
