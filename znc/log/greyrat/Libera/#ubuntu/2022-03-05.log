[01:17:34] <SnakesAndStuff> Hello. I'm migrating and updating and I'm hoping to find a solution. Currently on an older webserver I'm using pdftk to fill out a pdf email the output to a customer. My understanding is that pdftk has been dropped from debian due to an older dependency. I see there is a java version that replaces this, but it isn't present in the 18.04 repository. Can anyone point me into the right direction for
[01:17:40] <SnakesAndStuff> programatically filling out a pdf in newer versions from the command line/script?
[01:17:44] <SnakesAndStuff> Surely there are numerous others that have encountered this.
[01:19:08] <tomreyn> SnakesAndStuff: i think poppler-utils may provide what you want
[01:20:27] <tomreyn> https://packages.ubuntu.com/focal/amd64/poppler-utils/filelist
[01:20:41] <tomreyn> though i'm not entirely sure i got your use case
[01:20:57] <sarnold> taking user-supplied content to stuff into a pdf is a historically difficult thing to do safely. I hope you've got this thing confined via VM tooling or apparmor profiles or similar
[01:21:02] <SnakesAndStuff> The current use case is I have a pdf that has fields... and I use pdftk from a script to fill in those fields
[01:23:19] <SnakesAndStuff> Because my only other option is to manually fill this out for every customer/client.
[01:23:46] <sarnold> if it's *you* filling out the fields, that's fine and everything :)
[01:24:06] <sarnold> I'd probably just reach for latex to generate the whole thing, but if you don't already know latex, that's a huge learning curve
[01:24:11] <tomreyn> still a terrible workflow
[01:24:26] <tomreyn> can't you edit the source document?
[01:24:53] <sarnold> heh I'd rather edit a simple .txt file with four fields than edit a pdf in acrobat or whatever
[01:25:23] <SnakesAndStuff> It is a contract/agreement that I have to use that is in PDF format. I'm not allowed to change it etc.
[01:25:48] <SnakesAndStuff> Or even re-render it. It is a standardized form that is handed down from those above me.

[01:27:45] <SnakesAndStuff> tomreyn: Believe me... I'm not a huge fan either. Problem is that those above me care less about the work flow and want it to look "how it has always looked"
[01:28:16] <tomreyn> no doubt, they're the problem
[01:28:20] <SnakesAndStuff> they are the same people that require support tickets to create busy work that the other workers are qualified to do. But if we have a support ticket system it justifies their other layer if IT services.
[01:28:31] <jhutchins> SnakesAndStuff: I'd hate to see you reduced to running a Windows system just for this.  Adobe used to have a limited version that worked with Linux.  Open/Libre Office has some PDF editing/form filling capability, but the PDF standards are so broad that they might not work with your docu,ment.

[01:29:30] <SnakesAndStuff> What are the security implications of form-filling a known base pdf as long as you sanitize the input? It is customer data like name, phone number, address, etc.
[01:29:47] <alkisg> There are many fill-pdf packages in npm, maybe you could use one of them: https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=fill%20pdf
[01:30:30] <SnakesAndStuff> And I get it... When there is a problem that seems like it should have a simple solution, but it doesn't: there is often a reason why the solution isn't simple.

[04:16:59] <kn100> I'm not sure if this is the best place to ask this, but I'm having a strange problem with rsync. I've got DirA locally, and DirB on a NAS, which I have mounted using CIFS. When I run rsync, no matter what, it copies ALL the files from DirA to DirB, and sets the 'modified' time of the files in DirB to the current time.
[04:17:44] *** Joins: dirtcastle (~dirtcastl@2409:4072:814:590f:589b:1fff:fe94:85ce)
[04:17:46] <kn100> The command I am using is `rsync -av /home/kn100/DirA/ /media/DirB/`but I have tried using --ignore-times and --checksum and get the same result.
[04:19:43] <rfm> kn100, first thing I'd check is that the clocks are set right on both the local system and the NAS
[04:21:48] <sarnold> kn100: copying *all* the data from source to destination may make sense over a network filesystem, there's not a whole lot of point in copying all the data from the NAS to the local machine just to checksum it...
[04:22:16] <sarnold> kn100: normally when moving data between two machines you'd rather use ssh or something similar, so an rsync process can run on the remote system, and do checksums over there, etc
[04:22:36] <kn100> sarnold, the --checksum flag was purely just me experimenting, I'm aware it's crazy to do that normally. I was just getting rather frustrated

[04:31:45] <EriC^^> kn100: it likely won't, i think it has to do with what 'modify' means and its relation to cross-filesystem copying
[04:32:41] <EriC^^> actually nevermind
[04:33:20] <kn100> It's a consumer grade NAS with an ext4 filesystem, and the client is also on ext4 - but I wonder if the CIFS stuff in the middle or some crappy software on the NAS is causing the problem. Know of any alternatives to rsync/other avenues of exploration - assuming this problem persists?
[04:34:27] <kn100> The use case is I use Shotwell on my Ubuntu box to sync photos to my local library on my desktop, and then run rsync nightly to copy them to my NAS, where they're accessed by a home server and indexed for Photoprism
[04:34:30] <EriC^^> it should work, i confused ctime with mtime
[04:34:48] <kn100> should I be expecting the ctime to match across the files?
[04:35:14] <EriC^^> ctime will be different cause it depends on the inode, but mtime should match
[04:35:18] *** Joins: hollowman (~hollowman@openSUSE/member/hollowman)
[04:35:34] <kn100> because it appears to be setting that to the current time too, mtime is 1 second later than ctime for the files after rsync has finished with them

[04:57:01] <kn100> the uid and gid I expect need to match the user using the mount on the client right? As in, I am kn100 on my computer, my uid and gid are 1000, an therefore in the cifs mounting options in fstab I should set uid=1000,gid=1000
[04:57:04] <sarnold> oingoboingo: if you're building the kernels yourself rather than using packaged kernels, it's probably easier to just skip the ubuntu-supplied sources entirely
[04:57:34] <EriC^^> yeah kn100 i think that's right
[04:57:37] <kn100> if so, that's how it's currently configured. In fact, `credentials=<blanked-out>,cache=strict,uid=1000,gid=1000,file_mode=0664,dir_mode=0775,iocharset=utf8` are the mounting options I am currently using, if that's helpful to know

[23:10:41] <Paddy_NI> I am unable to access any websites via Firefox or Google Chrome on my Ubuntu MATE install.  I am able to ping 8.8.8.8 but cannot ping www.google.com.  I have also noticed that apt cannot access the internet either.  I have a feeling that somehow the ProtonVPN Client might have corrupted something.
[23:11:24] <JoeBk> Paddy_NI, does dns work?
[23:11:44] <Paddy_NI> When I do "ip addr" I noticed a connection called "ipv6leakintrf0".
[23:11:51] <Paddy_NI> JoeBk: How do I test that?
[23:11:52] <JoeBk> also, get a real vpn
[23:12:01] <JoeBk> nslookup google.com
[23:12:18] <Paddy_NI> JoeBk: I used PIA for years which worked just fine and recently switched to Proton
[23:12:46] <JoeBk> I used to have PIA
[23:12:56] <JoeBk> I switched to expressvpn
[23:13:27] <JoeBk> does nslookup work?
[23:13:29] <Paddy_NI> nslookup google.com tells me that the connection times out, no servers could be reached
[23:13:58] <JoeBk> not good
[23:14:33] <Paddy_NI> I use pihole running on a RPi3b plugged in to my router, every other device on my network works perfectly
