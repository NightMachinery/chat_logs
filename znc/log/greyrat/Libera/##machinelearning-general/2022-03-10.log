[08:01:28] <grandrew> numpy's percentile gives numbers like "75.0, 76.0" etc. but that's too rough
[08:02:22] <grandrew> maybe I need to fit the distribution and then calculate percentile with the formula?

[22:44:12] <andrew[m]123> BBAM trains on bounding boxes
[22:45:39] <andrew[m]123> the BBAM paper actually was one of the first I looked at and it cites LIID as the 2nd highest performing network trained on image-level labels
[22:47:04] <dostoyevsky2> Now I wonder about using BBAM for the bounding-boxes combined with a RCNN to get the pixels...
[22:47:58] <andrew[m]123> BBAM gets the pixels by training on bounding box labelled images
[22:48:11] <andrew[m]123> but ya, LIID follows a similar pipeline-like approach
[22:48:49] <andrew[m]123> and using BBAM in that pipeline might make sense, but I'll leave that to people smarter than me
[22:49:47] <dostoyevsky2> Yeah, better to start simple and try to properly clean the data
[22:51:29] <dostoyevsky2> I think that's the real ML paradoxon, 99.99% of your work should be cleaning data, and the rest model selection...  if Andrew Ng is to be believed
[22:54:35] <andrew[m]123> ya I've been thinking about that as well
