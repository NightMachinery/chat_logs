[10:50:43] <enterprisey> like, version two hundred and fifty?
[10:50:46] <enterprisey> that's quite the number
[10:52:22] <martian67> version numbers in isolation are meaningless
[10:52:45] <martian67> except for the fact the almost always go up i guess
[10:53:02] <enterprisey> I have yet to see a version number above 200 in any open-source software I'm familiar with
[10:54:11] <martian67> xterm
[10:54:34] <martian67> its on version 367
[10:54:44] <enterprisey> fair, but they've had since 1984
[10:54:53] <martian67> so what?
[10:55:08] <martian67> if you added up all point releases of say the linux kernel, it would be in the thousands easily
[10:55:22] <martian67> its meaningless out of context
[10:55:58] <enterprisey> I don't get why my initial message received that response, so I'm not going to continue this conversation

[12:24:47] <jj5> I haven't written much C# in the last decade, but bear with me...
[12:25:03] <jj5> if you have a value type EmailAddress, it can have just one single member being a String
[12:25:27] <jj5> but before you create/cast/convert an EmailAddress you verify the email is in a valid format.
[12:25:45] <jj5> this means, sans the null String, if you have an EmailAddress value you know it's valid.
[12:26:10] <jj5> like what Pat Helland talks about with "data inside the service" vs "data outside the service"
[12:26:33] <jj5> you can use value types to model data inside the service, so you know it's valid and don't need to wonder if it is or isn't
[12:27:13] <jj5> and those EmailAddresses are just the single pointer to a string underneath, so essentially no overhead as compared with a bare String

[14:46:03] <jj5> iDrougge: yep, System.String is immutable reference type, heap allocated byte array
[14:46:21] <rb> jj5: yeah that will exist too, but aside from that sending messages to objects that are within the current actor would still happen with a stack, no?

[19:54:04] <pushcx> hoistbypetard: Thanks.
[19:56:03] <hoistbypetard> pushcx: would it potentially be reasonable to ban gavinhoward.com ? while i will certainly try to ignore it in the future, it's hard not to respond to that.
[19:57:54] <pushcx> I'm thinking about it and trying to figure out how to explain what I'm seeing. The guy really strongly reminds me of Hexstream, michealochurch, and drewdevault. I don't think they're consciously trolling but the discussions on their posts are almost always dumpster fires. The posts are hyperbolic, often ranting about perceived injustices from powerful faceless entities.
[19:58:01] <ngoldbaum> imo saying the covid vaccine is about as dangerous as covid itself is a relevant piece of information to know when considering the author’s other views
[19:59:57] <pushcx> So I'm trying to figure out how to explain what the pattern is here, because I'm not going to ban somebody on a hunch I can't explain in a way that guides future submissions.
[20:00:16] <hoistbypetard> i don't think it was posted with the intent of trolling either, in fairness
[20:00:51] <hoistbypetard> but i think the site is likely to provoke responses like mine (even if i make an effort not to be the agent next time)
[20:01:26] <pushcx> I think all four are entirely sincere, fwiw. But I can't really mod somebody's soul, I can only act on and deal with the results in the world, which is that we have this big fight threads that go nowhere and do nothing.
[20:01:27] <hoistbypetard> so maybe the site and not the poster should get the ban?
[20:02:37] <pushcx> To put it better: when I say 'troll', I'm referring to results and not intentions, because nobody can be certain about intentions except the author. It doesn't matter if someone is sincerely trying to sow chaos or doing so incindentally; the resulting post is indistinguishably inflammatory.
[20:02:50] <amazigh> maybe ignore his posts?
[20:02:53] <pushcx> Nobody has to be Anubis weighing hearts to say that these things arne't working.
