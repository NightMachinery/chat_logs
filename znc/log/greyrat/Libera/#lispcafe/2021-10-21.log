[01:14:31] <selwyn> windows doesn't have 'time' sigh
[01:20:49] <gilberth> Could be worse, macOS doesn't have telnet or ftp.
[01:21:03] <selwyn> at least it has ssh
[01:21:21] <selwyn> i think windows does have telnet and ftp, so exactly inverted lol
[01:21:42] <gilberth> I wonder how long. It feels like Windows with time, as you need to install more and more basic utilities on your own.
[01:21:57] <selwyn> i see
[01:22:46] <selwyn> sometimes i wonder why the clasp devs favour it
[01:23:20] <gilberth> favour what?
[01:23:27] <selwyn> macos
[01:23:34] <selwyn> they often develop on it
[01:23:47] <gilberth> Well, it still is an BSD.
[01:24:14] <gilberth> Or: Why do I favor macOS over Linux? But I seriously consider ditching it.
[01:24:30] <selwyn> i don't think i could switch to macos
[01:24:43] <gilberth> Something is not right, when I plan to downgrade^Wupgrade from 10.14 to 10.10.
[01:25:28] <gilberth> selwyn: I won't recommend it. Ten years ago, it was fine. A non-broken GUI plus a Unix beneath.
[01:26:32] <gilberth> And no trouble what so ever with device drivers or sth.

[01:58:35] <selwyn> where you boil apples down over time to make a thick paste
[01:58:38] <selwyn> different from apple sauce
[01:58:43] <selwyn> a belgian heritage apparently
[01:59:45] <gilberth> Like peanut butter?
[01:59:57] <selwyn> i suppose, but idk how peanut butter is made
[02:00:31] <gilberth> I don't know either. And actually I can't remember having eaten some ever.
[02:00:38] <selwyn> peanut butter?
[02:00:42] <gilberth> yep
[02:01:01] <selwyn> now i come to think of it its quite different
[02:01:19] <selwyn> i think the peanuts are roasted and crushed instead of being slow cooked for ages
[02:02:05] <gilberth> Hmm, yes, how to cook peanuts, anyway?
[02:02:17] <selwyn> you can make soup with them
[02:02:23] <selwyn> using peanut butter as a base
[02:02:33] <gilberth> ok
[02:04:53] <gilberth> *sigh* I need a GF, so that dishes will be prepared at my house again. Not like she would have to, but it's pointless to prepare anything for one alone. And my cousin at whose place I hide, feeds from chips and sausages only. Entirely pointless to prepare something else, he won't eat it.
[02:05:55] <gilberth> I read "pc--;" Hugh?! The machine could go backwards?
[02:06:34] <gilberth> What a twist.
[02:09:35] <selwyn> chips and sausages lol
[02:09:39] <selwyn> is he english?
[02:10:21] <gilberth> Nope, just special. He would refuse to eat anything else.
[02:10:28] <selwyn> i know that feel with cooking alone
[02:10:49] <selwyn> if you make something nice you just end up with lots of leftovers
[02:11:37] <gilberth> Well, one of my problems is also that I have trouble doing anything for just me.
[02:13:16] <gilberth> Same thing with spending money, I just can't spend money for myself.

[02:59:29] <hayley> <pl> "*no-defun-allowed*: https://news..." <- pl: Appel's Garbage collection can be faster than stack allocation, but he needs 7x as much memory to match stack for a made up machine.
[03:02:02] <Mondenkind> I only skimmed part of that paper, but I don't understand what that does that you couldn't do with separate call/data stacks
[03:02:23] <hayley> But also see Gil Gene's commentary on PauselessHashMap: "> This is also a classic example of how GC makes this sort of concurrent programming thing both fast and simple. This is a classic case of an asymmetric speed need between two concurrent actors that share mutable state. I worked hard to make the fast path get() and put() cheap, and managed (I think) to not even use volatiles in the fast path. In doing this, I shifted all the cost I could
[03:02:23] <hayley> think of to the background work, where latency doesn't matter nearly as much. This sort of trick would be much harder (or slower) to do if GC wasn't there to safely pick up the junk behind us, as it would (invariably, I think) add a need for additional synchronizing work in the fast path."
[03:02:28] <Mondenkind> don't even need to burn a register for that, because you don't need a frame pointer anymore
[03:03:17] <Mondenkind> hayley: yeah, travis downs has written about that too
[03:08:05] <hayley> Mondenkind: Yes, also see CONS should not CONS its arguments wherein Baker describes using stack allocation by default. Then Azul tried it (haven't heard of anyone else doing it) with writing-back of which allocation points make objects which escape, and it worked okay.
[03:22:07] <pjb> gilberth: if I was richer, I'd have a cook, a chauffeur, perhaps even a majordome… I'd be a factor in the reduction of unemployment!
[03:23:22] <hayley> If I were richer, I would start a CLOSOS money giving out project
[03:24:11] <hayley> Alternately, a milk shop is a good bad investment.

[05:47:16] <gilberth> Ok. I need a plan. I face a one cycle delay slot for jumps, a two cycle delay slot for memory reads, a skip-next-instruction feature, call and return instructions, and what is worst: A feature for OR'ing something into the next instruction.
[05:48:44] <gilberth> The latter is used for indirect addressing or to plug the alu-op argument to BITBLT right into the instruction, but it could be anything.

[06:06:53] <gilberth> What makes you believe that adding even more neurons to your brain would make you less bored?
[06:08:00] <hayley> No, it is an artificial one.
[06:08:36] <gilberth> I noticed, but shouldn't you remove neurons to make it less bored.
[06:08:53] <hayley> Well, I'm bored, not the neural network.
[06:09:57] <gilberth> You mentioned already that your neural network is bored.
[06:11:57] <gilberth> hayley: While you're bored, as a compiler expert, do you have any advice on how to compile the microcode?
[06:12:25] <hayley> The training process has now learned how to annoy me. First, it plateaus at a loss of 0.013 or so, then only after a while does it drop down to 0.0035 and get stuck there again.
[06:12:31] <hayley> gilberth: Do I really look like a compiler expert?

[06:14:00] <hayley> Yes. Training^Wbeing trained by neural networks is very annoying.
[06:16:56] <gilberth> Can't you teach them some tricks? Like compiling microcode?
[06:17:34] <hayley> No, you only use them for selecting SIMD instructions sometimes.
[06:17:57] <gilberth> Boring indeed.
[06:18:06] <hayley> https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.00907.pdf
[06:18:17] <gilberth> Can a neural network train a neural network which trains a neural network?
[06:18:36] <hayley> Hm, this is a compiler for a neural network, I thought it was a compiler using a neural network.
[06:19:00] <hayley> gilberth: A neural network quine: https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.05859
[06:19:14] * gilberth is a machine learning noob.
[06:21:24] <gilberth> This delay slot for jumps is giving me a headache.
[06:22:32] <hayley> Well, I eventually have to teach my VM to bill for each object "loaded", which gets hairy when you cache objects so that EQ works. We need another set of objects that were "loaded", and some more caches to avoid scanning slot values repeatedly.
[06:24:15] <gilberth> I mean, before I know the exact set of previous instructions, I can't attack the instruction modifying instruction. And then there also is the stack, how to tell what target a RET^WPOPJ instruction can see? The stack could be freely manipulated.

[06:27:22] <gilberth> Stock prices would be less boring.
[06:28:38] <hayley> Yeah, well they tend to just predict the value of the last day.
[06:29:21] <gilberth> They predict the past?
[06:29:44] <hayley> Yes, as there tends to be some correlation between x_{t-1} and x_t

[06:33:42] <gilberth> What's so special about that machine?

[06:34:05] <Mondenkind> (freudian slip?)
[06:34:41] <hayley> Mondenkind: The stock cooler for this Ryzen 1600 is quite good still. Though IIRC the 1600X, 1700, and higher get rainbow LEDs.
[06:34:46] * gilberth prefers his machine not glowing in the dark.
[06:35:16] <hayley> So do I. But I never bothered to desolder the blue LEDs from the fans which came with this case.
[06:35:18] <gilberth> hayley: You need 128 threads for SICL bootstrapping?
[06:35:31] <Mondenkind> wait, the cpu comes with a cooler that has leds on it?

[06:36:24] <gilberth> Mondenkind: Everything has LEDs these days. To disturb your sleep. This is why blue is the favorite colour.
[06:36:40] <Mondenkind> because people who do not sleep enough get depressed

[06:38:16] <hayley> Well, I am done toying around with this model. After lunch I just need to write the introductory and conclusion blabber.
[06:38:36] <gilberth> And why do CPU coolers glow anyway? I mean, do people run their machines without a case?
[06:38:38] <hayley> I never wrote much of conclusions, because they looked the same as introductions except that you got to sound more confident.
[06:39:10] <Catie> gilberth: transparent cases
[06:39:11] <Mondenkind> 'tell 'em what you're gonna tell them; tell 'em what you told 'em; and then tell 'em again'
[06:39:12] <hayley> gilberth: People have cases with transparent plastic (sometimes glass) windows. 
[06:39:31] <hayley> My favourite conclusion: "There is none. I can't tell you to do anything really, I've only made destructive statements. Okay, one thing: go complain about something else."

[06:40:50] <Catie> gilberth: I've got mine up against my desk for the same reason
[06:41:18] <hayley> Mine is under the desk. I barely see it.
[06:41:43] <gilberth> Guess, you still hear it, though.
[06:41:56] <Catie> it's soothing
[06:42:17] <hayley> No, /me has Genesis playing and thus can't hear anything.
[06:42:37] <gilberth> Right. The noise the disk array makes, when accessed.
[06:42:50] <hayley> A good day to have SSDs too.
[06:44:59] <gilberth> As I build my machine, I was too cheap for like 8TB of SSD.
[06:45:13] <hayley> gilberth? Too cheap?
[06:45:57] <gilberth> Yep.
[06:46:21] <gilberth> 8TB SSD is how much? How much in 2015? I don't know.
[06:46:39] <hayley> Depends on the performance of the SSD.
[06:47:05] <hayley> First on Amazon was $850, but on sale for $750.
[06:47:09] <Mondenkind> and, if you do not want to use your data, it is important to mirror it
[06:47:14] <gilberth> And when I get a new machine, it'll rather have more RAM and still more disk space. Factor that in.
[06:47:15] <Mondenkind> so multiply by two
[06:47:24] <hayley> A fast one is $1,460
[06:47:37] <gilberth> hayley: That's not much. Got really cheap.
[06:47:49] <Mondenkind> s/use/lose/
[06:48:20] <gilberth> Mondenkind: I keep backups and run a RAID.
[06:48:40] <gilberth> But otherwise: How reliable are SSD actually?
[06:48:57] <Mondenkind> raid is not so nice to recover from as a mirror
[06:49:07] <Mondenkind> and until your new drive arrives you are sol if you have another failure
[06:49:18] * hayley still wonders if applying for the RISC-V foundation "get free machines for compiler hacking" project is a bad idea.
[06:49:54] <gilberth> Mondenkind: That is why you keep a spare.
[06:50:58] <gilberth> And you use different brands. But otherwise: I am a backup nazi.
[06:52:15] <gilberth> Different from plants, which die quickly in my presence, disks like me. I never had one failing for me.
[06:53:15] <hayley> Sadly I don't remember what mini PC beach got for work.

[06:58:24] <hayley> I doubt it.
[06:58:24] <Mondenkind> smh my head
[07:00:45] <gilberth> I could need some silent, dark!, Linux machine with decent graphics. I should give Linux a try for desktop.

[07:04:10] <Catie> Is that Computer Modern?
[07:04:14] <hayley> Mondenkind: I could swear I read about some people mixing dynamic and static dispatch in Rust though. Almost like a manual JIT.
[07:04:24] <hayley> Catie: Yes.
[07:04:54] <Catie> Hell Yeah
[07:05:15] <Mondenkind> hayley: there is some way to say 'x has a pointer to some object satisfying trait T, along with a vtbl', I think.  But it is statically decided whether a given dispatch is static or dynamic
[07:05:39] <Mondenkind> praise knuth
[07:06:56] <hayley> Okay, I swear there was some way to specialise a function for given static dispatch as well as dynamic dispatch for everything else.
[07:07:38] <hayley> i.e. if T, U, V implement trait R, then we specialise T but U and V still use dynamic dispatch. I dunno how it was done exactly, admittedly.
[07:08:57] <hayley> Maybe I imagined it, who knows. Can't find anything for "Rust dyn specialization"

[09:10:54] <hayley> gilberth: Different one to before, though they're both called OCTO
[09:14:17] <hayley> AFAICT I could use userspace memory protection like MPX to have a totally pauseless compacting GC (including threads bunching up by trapping during state changes). Just rotate fromspace and tospace between two "colours", have the fromspace colour protect all unmoved pages, and have tospace colour only protect fromspace pages.
[09:15:18] <hayley> Thus, you maintain the invariant that a thread only sees pointers to one space (allowing you to still do EQ with one instruction), and also that threads don't have to wait to flip.
[09:16:41] <hayley> You can do colouring with pointer metadata rather than the MMU, but then you have a lot of trapping when it comes time to flip.
[09:20:20] <hayley> If you only have one global memory map and no pointer metadata, then you do have to be careful so that the entire process sees fromspace or tospace, protecting all moving pages until all threads flip. But that's probably still not too bad.
[09:25:15] <hayley> The only change is that the trap handler has to check which colour the GC wants mutators in (i.e. if the mutator needs to flip). Then everything else works out.
[09:26:56] <Mondenkind> I don't understand why you can do EQ with one instruction
[09:27:04] <Mondenkind> wouldn't you still have to mask off the colour bit first?
[09:27:57] <hayley> No, a thread only sees one colour at a time, so the colour bits are always equal.
[09:28:42] <hayley> (We still have a read barrier which does something to correct the situation if the thread tries to load a reference with the wrong colour.)
[09:28:50] <Mondenkind> ah--so you have thread-local pauses, but still no stw?
[09:28:55] <hayley> Yes.

[10:01:13] <hayley> But, by doing the "colouring" in the MMU I think we avoid the read trap storms, as you only have to update pointers to objects that are moving.
[10:08:37] <hayley> The catch still is that you need userspace protection, or you kludge without by protecting both from- and to-space until every thread checkpoints and flips, and then only protecting from-space. But I think the kludge isn't too bad, given that accesses to fragmented pages should be uncommon.

[12:38:54] <Mondenkind> how does tex decide when to hyphenate?
[12:39:10] <Mondenkind> googling turns a bunch of stuff on its algorithm it uses to decide on potential hyphenataion points in a word
[12:39:44] <Mondenkind> you could just hyphenate when the spacing would otherwise be too wide/narrow.  But I assume you also want to minimize total hyphenations in a paragraph, which might involve different choices
[12:43:50] <hayley> IIRC hyphenation is O(n^2) with dynamic programming, so it is probably the latter.

[18:54:20] <selwyn> wondering if poland and the uk will try to gang up on the eu together
[18:57:37] <ck_> you have all this extra money that was previously going towards regulations on pillows (or something)
[18:58:02] <ck_> billions of pounds every minute, you're swimming in money (and blue passports)
[18:58:02] <shka> current polish government can't do foreign politics for shit  
[18:58:07] <shka> so i would not count on it
[18:58:32] <shka> we alienated every single friend we had
[18:59:03] <shka> including not acknowledging Biden as the president of the USA which was a galaxy brain move 
[19:02:59] <pl> selwyn: one of the idiotic moves was supporting conservatives that went brexit :>
[19:03:47] <pl> for all that UK was more of a problem in EU than anything else, they had one thing they insisted on that was helpful to smaller EU countries
[19:04:13] <pl> so, when UK went brexit, poland pissed off all political capital till it had none, nothing could stop so-called "two-speed EU"
[19:05:28] <shka> which is ostensible what the current government wants anyway 
[19:05:30] <selwyn> pl: i see
[19:05:45] <shka> marginalized, fringe Poland
[19:05:56] <selwyn> but what did britain actually offer to the smaller eu countries? for want of a better word, states rights?
[19:06:03] <shka> not integrated into European systems
[19:06:10] <pl> selwyn: it was against "two speed EU"
[19:06:25] *** Quits: random-nick (~random-ni@87.116.183.63) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[19:06:26] <pl> so it was one benefit out of sea of shit
[19:06:31] <pl> but an useful one
[19:06:44] <selwyn> right
[19:07:05] <shka> also, UK is pro-USA country, which neither Germany or France really is 
[19:07:42] <selwyn> yes
[19:07:49] <shka> and although i have no love for hamburgers, it changes the balance of power
[19:08:33] <pl> the two-speed europe is essentially allowing for bigger integration between just France and Germany, instead of insisting on the same level of integration across whole EU
[19:08:51] <pl> in this case, it ended up with eurozone becoming slightly different from non-eurozone EU

[19:09:38] <selwyn> return to charlemagne
[19:10:00] <shka> if anything, current political condition of the eastern europe makes this idea more relevant then ever
[19:10:30] <shka> Czech? Poland? Hungary? All moving away from Europe currently.
[19:11:08] <pl> before current brand of idiots in Poland, we had somewhat good position to push for certain things, even if it wasn't always as well used as it could be
[19:11:26] <selwyn> shka: but in what sense
[19:11:53] <selwyn> if you ask people in these countries, i assume they will say they are europeans (unlike britain, say)
[19:12:14] <shka> oh boy, where do i start...
[19:12:16] <selwyn> i simply accept the contradiction by accepting that europe was never that liberal in the first place
[19:14:14] <pjb> shka: it's idiotic. It's like saying Kazakstan was moving away from Asia when the USSR was falling down.
[19:14:50] <pjb> It's just that more and more people realize that the E.U. is not a good deal, its reality is opposite to what it sold.
[19:14:53] <shka> pjb: do you know who was the leader of the Kazakstan at that time?
[19:15:00] <pjb> Just like communism.
[19:15:56] <pjb> shka: yeah, just like, you know who is the leader of the Italy right now?
[19:16:41] <shka> listen, you simply don't know about how it was in the eastern block during that time, so don't use stupid analogies 
[19:17:24] <pjb> It's exactly the same. You needed passports to go to the next town, here we need passports to go to the restaurant.
[19:18:38] <shka> regardless
[19:19:15] <shka> selwyn: anyway, Poland is simply incapable of stable, sensible, foreign politics at the time
[19:19:48] <selwyn> makes two of us :p
[19:20:28] <shka> well, UK is widely more influential country 
[19:20:32] <shka> and you will be fine
[19:20:53] <shka> while in Poland we have that fairy tale idea of "complete independence"
[19:21:03] <shka> which is simply not how current world operates
[19:21:29] <shka> every single country in the world is interconnected with others
[19:21:37] <shka> well, maybe except north korea
[19:21:46] <selwyn> i'm not always sure that we will be fine
[19:21:58] <White_Flame> NK is intimately tied with china to survive, afaik
[19:21:59] <selwyn> life here has a real volatility to it these days
[19:22:22] <selwyn> nk is not too disconnected from russia/china in the economic sphere
[19:22:28] <shka> White_Flame: well, and to be fair, they have to invest into strong deterrence force 
[19:23:00] <shka> so the point is, this is interconnected world, and actions have consequences 
[19:23:09] *** Quits: hendursa1 (~weechat@user/hendursaga) (Quit: hendursa1)
[19:23:27] <shka> for instance, in the case of UK, leaving EU will eventually tie the country to the USA
[19:23:40] *** Joins: hendursaga (~weechat@user/hendursaga)
[19:23:54] <shka> eventually it can become the colony of the USA, which would be the most ironing twist
[19:24:05] <shka> *ironic
[19:24:24] <selwyn> for example, the governments response to the lorry driver crisis is 'let business sort out the lack of skilled drivers'
[19:24:32] <White_Flame> lol
[19:24:33] <selwyn> but business can't/won't do this
[19:24:48] <selwyn> at this point, its not about whether the policies are good or bad
[19:25:02] <selwyn> it's about government simply abdicating its responsibilities
[19:25:17] <selwyn> because no-one else will accept responsibility for training a workforce
[19:25:29] <selwyn> so i don't know what the consequences will be
[19:25:36] <selwyn> downside ranges from slightly bad to cliff edge imo
[19:26:02] <pl> well, brexit happened because conservatives paid with country's future for internal party stability
[19:26:21] <pjb> selwyn: business can solve it: in UK they simply raise lorry drivers wages! (which they should and would have done a long time ago, if immigration wasn't used to reduce wages).
[19:26:26] <shka> my point is
[19:26:26] <selwyn> shka: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fPSO8pdAX6c
[19:26:27] -ixelp- The The - Heartland (Official Video) - YouTube
[19:26:40] <pl> they ended up fucking around and found out
[19:26:47] <shka> in the case of the UK, you substituted EU with USA in the long run
[19:26:50] <shka> or China
[19:27:03] <pl> among many things they found out they were unarmed in the battle of wits, because all experience in negotiations was on EU side
[19:27:17] <shka> and it is insane to think that you will have more play with those as if you would be dealing with Europe
[19:27:54] <selwyn> well
[19:28:54] <shka> that is also why Russia prefers to deal with individual countries of the Europe instead of the union as a whole 
[19:29:22] <shka> because balance of power is such that it does not leave a lot of playing field
[19:29:38] <selwyn> imo brexiteers still think that the eu is a kind of late soviet dinosaur whose historic destiny is to collapse
[19:29:52] <shka> well, pjb seems to think so 
[19:29:53] <selwyn> so the argument is more like 'only suckers would want to stay'
[19:30:06] <shka> but you know what?
[19:30:36] <selwyn> usa as overlord has lots of downsides for the uk anyway, not sure that they would commit to it as a least bad option
[19:30:40] <shka> former Soviet Union countries would be in a better state if the Soviet Union was reformed instead of collapsing 
[19:31:03] <selwyn> yes
[19:31:19] <selwyn> so you should not aim for collapse of your society
[19:31:26] <shka> no shit
[19:31:30] <selwyn> lol
[19:31:31] <pl> some recent reviews of the historical events suggest two points that were crucial for USSR ending up in collapse
[19:31:55] <pl> one is Khrushchev getting ousted by Brezhnev, another is Chernobyl
[19:32:17] <selwyn> hm
[19:32:36] <pl> well, technically Truman policies, too
[19:32:48] <pl> but that's more on starting the cold war
[19:33:06] <shka> you may not realize that, but the commie block was teetering on a verge of collapse trough the whole 80s 
[19:33:41] <shka> and yet, it was still significant player because of the sheer size
[19:34:00] <shka> after collapse, there was just a vacuum 
[19:34:11] <pl> if not for chernobyl, USSR might have pulled through the reforms
[19:34:26] <shka> yeah, i think it may be posible 
[19:34:44] <pl> if not for Khrushchev, the economy wouldn't enter systematic problems spiral
[19:34:53] <selwyn> president xi set up a commission to investigate why it collapsed, and the conclusion was apparently 'gorby fucked it'
[19:34:55] <pl> well, if not for Khrushchev getting ousted
[19:35:18] <pl> selwyn: Gorby ran out of money because Brezhnev fucked up the economy and Chernobyl took away his margins
[19:35:50] <shka> selwyn: which is also worth noting because in theory Soviet Union had a better starting position then China into capitalism
[19:35:58] <selwyn> yeah
[19:36:23] <pl> shka: Brezhnev coup was critical in fucking that up
[19:36:24] <shka> highly educated population, technical prowess, a lot of natural resources
[19:36:43] <selwyn> one interesting alternate history is if beria took power after stalin died and did a capitalism
[19:36:44] <shka> while China... was not that
[19:37:01] <pl> selwyn: ... I'm not sure it would go in any way nice
[19:37:15] <shka> Beria was a monster.
[19:37:17] <pl> ^^^
[19:37:18] <selwyn> beria was a horrible guy
[19:37:36] <selwyn> note that i only say it would be interesting
[19:37:38] <shka> i mean, Russia never really had good leadership
[19:37:58] <pl> selwyn: there's a reason why I consider Brezhnev ousting Khrushchev more important event, because it happened /because/ Khrushchev was pushing for democratic reforms
[19:38:34] * shka wonders what would be if not for the endemic alcoholism
[19:38:53] <shka> could Soviet Union survive :P
[19:39:04] <shka> that is many times worse then Chernobyl :P
[19:39:07] <pl> shka: not sure
[19:39:22] <pl> I mean, Brezhnev put in oligarchy in place
