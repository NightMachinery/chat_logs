[14:00:47] <GuiToris> when I looked up, I only found wave mp3 converters
[14:01:05] <GuiToris> RIFF (little-endian) data, WAVE audio, MPEG Layer 3, mono 16000 Hz
[14:02:01] <GuiToris> is it a wave file or an mp3, I doubt it can be both
[14:02:35] <furq> it's an mp3 bitstream in a wav
[14:03:21] <GuiToris> so I should ffmpeg -i file.wav -c:a copy file.mp3
[14:04:06] <furq> sure if you want to
[14:04:28] <GuiToris> umm, I was trying to strip silence with sox, it couldn't use this file. Can ffmpeg strip silence from the beginning and end of the audio?
[14:05:19] <furq> yeah

[14:06:00] <GuiToris> thank you!
