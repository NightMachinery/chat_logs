[01:24:07] <selwyn> it appears to be motivated by kids who cannot understand the concept

[01:24:33] <pjb> Alan Kay is already spinning, not even in his tomb…
[01:24:48] <selwyn> weird to think that technological skills may have peaked with the millennials
[01:26:46] <selwyn> i guess i know what i am going to lecture the kids on when i am 40 lol
[01:27:04] <gilberth> I blame Apple and Microsoft, as they try hard to hide the concept of a directory. This drives me crazy, as you don't know anymore where your damn file is saved.
[01:27:06] <selwyn> ´didn´t they teach you how to open a pdf at school´ ´fuck off grandad´
[01:27:46] <selwyn> gilberth: yes
[01:27:54] <selwyn> and all manner of cloud storage which is not made obvious
[01:28:25] <aeth> Win 9x was the peak of discoverable UI because they couldn't assume that anyone knew how to use a computer
[01:28:44] <aeth> From Win XP onwards, they assumed that everyone knew it and just tried to be stylized and different, especially from Vista onwards.
[01:28:58] <aeth> So I guess Windows 2000 was the actual peak since it wasn't a buggy, unstable mess, unlike Win 9x and especially Win Me
[01:29:37] <gilberth> Wasn't Windows 2000 the first Windows NT for the masses?
[01:30:17] <selwyn> aeth: yes
[01:31:11] *** Joins: semz (~none@user/semz)
[01:31:15] <copec> I work as a sysadmin at an ISP, and I was always fascinated with all aspects of computers and how to accomplish things. It's common for us to hire techs working on their CS degree at the University of Utah
[01:31:34] <copec> and they wont really know any generals about using a computer
[01:31:57] <gilberth> This is in so far sad, as prior to Windows, people managed quite well on the command line to install and launch their games.
[01:32:05] <aeth> gilberth: technically, Windows 2000 wasn't for the masses. Windows Me was for the masses and Windows 2000 was just the next NT
[01:32:25] <selwyn> whatever happened to windows me
[01:32:32] <selwyn> i don´t remember ever encountering one in the wild
[01:32:33] <aeth> gilberth: but my family's computer (I was a kid back then) went Windows Me to 2000 as a sideways 'upgrade' because WinMe was too unstable, and we probably weren't the only ones
[01:32:46] <White_Flame> basically, data has become website/application specific.  There is no notion of moving data between applications anymore, or just having "the data" as an identifiable entity outside of the singular application it's for
[01:32:51] <gilberth> aeth: Ok. This is why asked. I have very little knowledge about Windows in general, as I never used it.
[01:32:59] <White_Flame> and that's what all application developers want:  "We own this part of your digital life"
[01:33:02] <aeth> I guess Windows XP was the true "Windows NT for the masses"
[01:33:28] <aeth> And after SP 3 it was solid
[01:33:31] <White_Flame> so it has nothing to do with kids, and everything to do with the scope grabbing behavior of software companies
[01:34:00] <copec> Windows ME was horrible, most people stuck to Windows 98 until Windows XP, because Windows 2000 didn't have great compatibility with many classic Windows applications
[01:34:21] <selwyn> gilberth: you´ve never used it? or you never had a windows machine
[01:34:37] <aeth> I stand by Windows 2000 being the peak of UI, then
[01:34:56] <copec> Windows 2000 was my favorite, it was concise
[01:35:03] <copec> It wasn't arbitrary and screwy
[01:35:11] <aeth> In Windows XP with classic mode (to look like 2k) you could get something similar, but by that point, every application wanted to look unique and not fit in (basically trying to copy the success of WinAmp), which is a trend that has continued to this day on Windows
[01:35:26] <aeth> (even e.g. Steam, Chrome, etc... which look way more out of place on Linux because they're from this Windows culture of standing out)
[01:35:28] <copec> and that really whipped the Lama's ass

[01:40:01] <selwyn> if i wanted to go down the nostalgia route i would have to tunnel irc through msn messenger somehow
[01:40:33] <aeth> I was wondering if AIM could be revived for this, too. I mostly used it through Pidgin, though
[01:41:29] <aeth> (then called gaim)
[01:41:42] <aeth> the way it went was: (1) Americans used AIM, (2) everyone else used MSNM, (3) people with Pidgin/etc. also had Yahoo and ICQ but nobody else used those
[01:41:57] <aeth> very useful to use one app though
[01:43:01] <selwyn> i used aim for a while
[01:43:53] <aeth> Google Talk killed them all. And then Google's incoherent strategy for IM killed Google Talk so everyone just started using stuff like Facebook Messenger instead
[01:45:17] <aeth> I drew the line at Google Talk discontinuing XMPP and becoming proprietary. I haven't used IM since then. May 2013, apparently. So, over 8 years now.
[01:45:39] <copec> That's when IM folded to me too
[01:45:51] <copec> now IM is text messages
[01:45:58] <aeth> yep
[01:46:03] <selwyn> as much as i sometimes dislike it discord is better than im 
[01:46:46] <aeth> I tried to get people to use Signal, which was "the right thing", but people don't want to and I refuse to use stuff like Telegram because Telegram has that phony custom encryption.
[01:47:28] <aeth> Plus Signal was phone-first and I'm decidedly phone-second. It's just not enjoyable typing on a phone. They're all the wrong aspect ratio these days. Too narrow. Ultrawide-in-portrait phones means (1) they're too narrow to enjoyably type in portrait and (2) you can see literally nothing behind the virtual keyboard in landscape
[01:49:19] <aeth> Not like it matters, anyway. Signal pushed a pump-and-dump cryptocurrency earlier this year, so they're yet another shady company now. (And, bizarrely, Signal somehow got the Long Now Foundation involved in that pump and dump scamcoin. You know, the foundation that's supposed to think in terms of tens of thousands of years. Backing a scam coin that was in the news for like 2 weeks.)
[01:49:58] <aeth> Discord is group-first so they don't really fill the 1:1-first messenger niche.
[01:50:41] * semz never understood the appeal of Discord
[01:50:49] <semz> used it once and found it utterly insufferable
[01:51:31] <aeth> Gaming.
[01:51:44] <aeth> You basically have no choice to get Discord for gaming groups.
[01:51:53] <aeth> Idk how or why it broke into the mainstream in 2020, though.
[01:52:10] <aeth> Now lots of RL groups use it for chat even though it's very, very clearly gaming-first, casual-chat-first.
[01:52:33] <semz> seems like there's always a flavor of the 5y messenger that gets inexplicably popular and then survives by network effects until the next one steals its lunch
[01:52:40] <gilberth> selwyn: I used Windows for launching games only. I don't call that using.
[01:52:55] <aeth> I guess Discord's popular because it's free for large groups. You know, until they IPO and investors start demanding a ROI. Then they'll cram every pixel with ads until people find something else.
[01:53:15] <Gnuxie> Discord also paid people to have their community on there 
[01:53:17] <aeth> But for now, it just operates on magic because it hasn't added ads yet.
[01:53:24] <aeth> Discord also... leeches off of reddit
[01:53:50] <aeth> For whatever reason, every subreddit heavily pushes the Discord, often in pinned messages at the top of every thread. That seems to have calmed down. A few years ago it was really, really bad.
[01:54:23] <aeth> Another niche where Discord is very successful is scams.
[01:54:36] <aeth> Every investment scam has their own Discord.
[01:54:53] <aeth> If you get investment advice from Discord, you've probably already lost your money.

[01:57:27] <aeth> Scams seem to use Discord because they're private. They use Twitter/Instagram/Reddit/etc. as the top of the funnel and then they invite you to "exclusive" "secret" knowledge. And then the actual scheming happens in an even more inner circle that you don't have access to. For whatever reason, there are a ton of pump and dump Discords, where you're supposedly the insider who's buying early, but there's

"There's no AVX instructions in LC-3." "Pity, how will it go fast then?"
[03:19:53] <hayley> With 16 bit registers it might be pretty easy to vectorise, or perhaps not. Who knows.

[10:52:17] <contrapunctus> I'm not sure if this was sent here yesterday (had some connection problems), so sending again 🤔
[10:52:48] <contrapunctus> I've got an Elisp wrapper macro around `cl-loop` . It calls `cl-loop` (passing user-supplied `cl-loop` clauses to it) inside a `with-foo` macro; the `cl-loop` calls a generic function called `iterator` to obtain values for each iteration.* But `with-foo` is implementation-dependent and I want to move it out into a method. I could create two generics called `iterator-setup` and `iterator-reset` , to
[10:52:48] <contrapunctus>  be called at the start and the end of the wrapper macro, but that means I can't use things like the `with-foo` macro, which is rather...inelegant? 🤔️ But I don't see any other way...

[16:08:15] <gin> my late nights are spent arguing with friends on chat. what bothers me about it is that I argue over insignificant stuff such as meaning of tech words. like what is "linux"? the kernel or the whole system?
[16:09:18] <gin> I don't enjoy arguing over such meta-level stuff because it is almost always a waste of time but easy to get sucked into such topics.
[16:09:35] <hayley> The kernel IMO.
[16:10:30] <hayley> Linux is the kernel, but I don't care if you call the system a Linux system, GNU/Linux system, <distribution name> system, etc.
[16:10:54] <gin> "Linux system" is nice. Will use that in future.
[16:11:47] <gin> that is one of several topics though. I don't think much about terms normally. most of the times I know what they mean even if the terms are imprecise.
[16:11:55] <hayley> Also "It runs Linux" is always correct, though it lacks detail.
[16:12:03] <selwyn> is anyone thinking of doing closos on the linux kernel? or is that just an idea that is ´out there´
[16:12:51] <hayley> IIRC doing CLOSOS as a Unix process is in the book, but I wouldn't do it permanently.
[16:13:42] <hayley> You have heavy context switches and a crappy MMU interface still. So the parts which seem to boost performance are not there.
[16:15:58] <gin> "It runs Linux" is also good.

[16:27:39] <Alfr> Hello gilberth.
[16:27:56] <gilberth> My plan for today: Figure out how to add a screen to the CADR and craft a new band to boot from.
[16:29:54] <hayley> BOLLOCKS, the damn "liberal" party here wants to legalise gay conversion therapy again.
[16:30:07] <gilberth> Before I do that I need to fix concurrency issues, as now the console runs in a different thread than the CPU simulator and interrupts could be lost to the CADR.
[16:30:39] <gilberth> hayley: Forced "therapy"?
[16:30:59] <hayley> That's nice. One day I will move far away from here.
[16:31:42] <gilberth> Guess, they give you enough reasons for that.
[16:31:58] <hayley> Yes.

[16:34:10] * hayley thinks. She is an adult, and she is legally disabled but still able to consent. So no one can do anything to her?
[16:36:40] <hayley> Though apparently the bill covers "prayer based treatment", which is a euphemism for informally delivered psychological torture.
[16:40:17] <hayley> Anyways, moving out looks a little more nicer now.
[16:40:34] <gilberth> This sounds pretty medieval.
[16:41:56] <hayley> What is sort of funny is that you hear the same shit about "curing autism" or whatever, except that it is based in "science" instead of "religious freedom".
[16:42:30] <Alfr> hayley, why would anyone want to cure that?

[16:43:44] <gilberth> Alfr: Because it's unnatural or degenerate. An irrational fear.
[16:43:58] <hayley> @Alfr: I dunno, people are assholes and can't see anything other than cis-hetero-neurotypical-<put your other privileged statuses that you can apparently "cure" your way to> normalcy as good?

[16:52:07] <selwyn> isnt there a nutter in america who has his own institution to do it

[17:20:19] <gilberth> Also I wonder why the CADR is using octal by default. I need my time to get used to that.
[17:23:25] <hayley> Maclisp?
[17:24:04] <gilberth> shka: A cutural war, you say? Fine, still I don't get why people have the urge to make all other people live and behave like they want them to. That's none of their business.
[17:24:27] <shka> gilberth: yes, but that's how it is
[17:24:35] <gilberth> hayley: Perhaps. Or it was still too common at that time.
[17:24:44] <gilberth> shka: That's sad.
[17:25:22] <gilberth> It's funny as the CADR is a 32-bit machine and not a 36-bit design.
[17:26:09] <Alfr> shka, problem is what culture? At least it can't be a consistent one, as it has to promote do as I say, not as I do.

[17:28:11] <selwyn> how can you beta test a car
[17:32:53] <pjb> gilberth: well octal had the advantage over hexa that it didn't require new digits. You just ignored 8 and 9.  While still having a direct mapping with binary.
[17:33:01] * hayley writes a test in one of those fancy test DSLs
[17:33:28] <hayley> When I enter my car: I feel safest of all, I can lock all my doors, it's the only way to live, ...
[17:34:00] <pjb> bebe+babe=1797c 
[17:34:13] <pjb> but those new digits are not hard to count with.
[17:35:43] <pjb> selwyn: (define-test test/car () (let ((k (cons 'beta 'alpha))) (check eq (car k) 'beta))) #| --> test/car |# (test/car) #| (test/car)  1 test,        1 success.  --> :success |# 
[17:36:05] <gilberth> pjb: Well, with 6-bit characters and word width a multiple of that, octal has the advantage that the word width divides evenly by the number of digits. Hex is better in that regard for our octet based machines we have today. Thus my remark.
[17:36:43] <selwyn> lol
[17:36:54] <pjb> gilberth: I know, but #o377 seem to be less a problem than learning  #xFF …
[17:37:59] <gilberth> pjb: OTOH You mistake octal numbers for decimal more easily. I am just not used to it, that's all. Figure I am not that old after all.
[17:40:30] <gilberth> But it's more like no indication of octal is used, as that is just default.

[21:20:59] <gilberth> I was curious about the CADR though because of its historical value.
[21:21:59] <ck_> I made the comparison because it came to mind when I thought about how snappy your video looks in comparison, and also for the reason that videos of the sort are so rare
[21:22:25] <ck_> maybe even rarely seen, too -- this one has only around 1k views; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfgjL7EUHZ8

[21:24:42] <Jacobis9000> what is a constant in lisp? CLAGI has asked me to define a NOT function using only IF and constants, but I don't know what constants are in this context, the book has not yet explained them, and when I look them up in the index, I actually get a page explaining comments not constants which must be a typographical error
[21:26:29] <ck_> anything for which the predicate CONSTANTP is true?
[21:30:33] <gilberth> Which is implementation-dependent.
[21:32:46] <White_Flame> it's doable using just T and NIL, which should be constantp
[21:32:54] <semz> some (preciously few) parts are guaranteed, in particular the quote forms you'd need for this exercise
[21:33:20] <Jacobis9000> ok thanks yeah I did it with just T and NIL
[21:35:07] <gilberth> T and NIL must be CONSTANTP as per ANSI-CL.
[21:35:46] <gilberth> It's only that things like (+ 1 2) may be CONSTANTP or not.

[22:09:12] <selwyn> hi ln43
[22:09:49] <ln43> hello selwyn
[22:11:27] <selwyn> how are you
[22:12:29] <Jacobis9000> h ln43 and selwyn
[22:12:32] <Jacobis9000> hi*
[22:12:52] <ln43> hi jacobis9000
[22:13:02] <Jacobis9000> so to be a LISP programmer, does one need an encyclopaedic knowledge of the various function names? I imagine that there is a core that you learn?
[22:13:27] <Jacobis9000> how are you ln43?
[22:14:36] <selwyn> jacobis9000: most of us don't know all of them, there are 978 symbols (which are, among other things, the names of functions) in the common-lisp package
[22:15:07] <Jacobis9000> I think the books I chose to buy were good choices. CLAGI is very good, Land of Lisp sort of rushes through stuff but is also quite good due to its fast pace, I haven't tackled the Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs yet
[22:15:12] <Jacobis9000> but I am not learning Scheme yet
[22:15:18] <selwyn> a minority are very esoteric and no-one tends to use them anymore
[22:16:12] <selwyn> usually, we call it 'common lisp' as opposed to lisp in capitals, to differentiate it from the original lisp of the late 1950s
[22:16:23] <ln43> jacobis: but why do you ended up on the lisp land?
[22:17:14] <selwyn> idk how many symbols i know but its not many lol. imo it is best to focus on learning the language area by area e.g. clos, the condition system, input/output
[22:17:29] <Jacobis9000> Ah because as a child I programmed in MUSHcode, which is a functional programming language with lists as its basic data structure and has been compared to LISP
[22:17:59] <selwyn> in particular, this is because a lot of the language is defined by fairly small collections of special operators and functions that all operate together in subtle ways (like the condition system)
[22:18:08] <selwyn> if you learn them one symbol at a time, it might not be very clear
[22:18:43] <ln43> yes that is why the clhs works as a reference mostly
[22:18:45] <Jacobis9000> So when I learned about LISP I had to learn it, although as selwyn points out, I am actually learning Common Lisp
[22:19:02] <ln43> ah, ok
[22:20:08] <Jacobis9000> MUSHcode was invented as a programming language for text games called MUSHes, you can actually do loads with it, it's a fully functioning language
[22:20:17] <selwyn> cool
[22:20:33] <ln43> yes many if not all the other good programming languages were and are inspired in some parts to the good old CL
[22:20:34] <selwyn> did you make many games with it?
[22:20:40] <White_Flame> yeah, I know the head guy on redwall muck, and helped with some of the tech here & there
[22:20:56] <White_Flame> some real jank tech that that stuff is all built on ;)
[22:21:23] <Jacobis9000> selwyn I have made a puzzle/text adventure with it, and bits and bobs of other stuff, the MUSH I play has kind of died recently with all the players leaving 
[22:21:29] <selwyn> ah :/
[22:21:48] <ln43> but again.... the time passes and the good things from the past remain, such as happens for the art and the technic and so on
[22:21:49] <selwyn> as i say, there is an active lispgames community to take part in
[22:21:54] <selwyn> i think there is a game jam coming up soon
[22:22:34] <ln43> passes / goes on
[22:24:29] <ln43> yes relating to game is interesting hw to explore the state-space maybe and things like that
[22:24:35] <selwyn> as a sprog i programmed games in java
[22:24:51] <ln43> but i should start doing something related... 
[22:25:10] <selwyn> if someone had introduced me to lisp at that age idk what would have happened
[22:25:31] <ln43> which age?
[22:25:33] <Jacobis9000> I don't know if I will make a game yet. I enjoy learning programming languages, but I am not great at coming up with ideas of stuff to build.
[22:26:12] <selwyn> ln43: i learned java from ~ ages 10-12, it was not easy
[22:26:57] <Jacobis9000> I found MUSHcode hard enough at that age, and gave up on programming shortly after to do other stuff.
[22:27:28] <selwyn> similar story for me
[22:27:48] <selwyn> but i think i would have carried on with it if i had known that computers/programming are more interesting than what java can provide
[22:28:02] <Jacobis9000> I don't think I had the broader knowledge nor mathematical knowledge necessary to program at that age.
[22:28:18] <Jacobis9000> I am learning Java next year
[22:28:30] <Jacobis9000> I am doing an OU degree in computer science and IT
[22:28:53] <selwyn> oh nice
[22:29:18] <Jacobis9000> yes so far I am thoroughly enjoying it, but I am only right at the beginning, and unfortunately this first module concentrates on Scratch
[22:29:25] <selwyn> yeah making games without trig knowledge is interesting. iirc i limited myself to horizontal/vertical movement
[22:29:31] <selwyn> for the srpites
[22:29:33] <ln43> yes there are so many different languages too choose from during university and later too
[22:29:44] <ln43> to choose from
[22:29:52] <ln43> a big pool ...
[22:30:16] <Jacobis9000> OU teaches python, Java, and the web dev languages, it says it will teach you HOW to program, not a host of languages in which to program, and you are to learn those on your own
[22:30:30] <Jacobis9000> which is fair enough
[22:30:48] <Jacobis9000> it's a very broad degree, I'll be doing CyberSecurity, and Networking, as well as Comp Sci
[22:31:17] <Jacobis9000> that's why I picked it, so I could do a bit of everything
[22:31:27] <Jacobis9000> in a structured way with deadlines
[22:31:49] <gilberth> I never was taught any specific language.
[22:32:17] <ln43> yes before consider that teachers at university were inventing theyr own programming language for courses
[22:32:32] <ln43> nowdays no more ... and that is an indicator
[22:32:41] <Jacobis9000> An indicator of what?
[22:33:00] <ln43> of decline
[22:33:43] <Jacobis9000> Not necessarily, perhaps it is an indicator of the demands of students, who wish to learn programming languages they will require for employment rather than an esoteric language used only in one university class
[22:34:47] <Jacobis9000> But I do agree you'd think university professors of computer science would come up with more languages
[22:35:17] <selwyn> proglang design is subtle
[22:35:26] <Jacobis9000> Have you seen the MIT OpenCourseware Scheme lectures on youtube?
[22:35:36] <selwyn> i would rather have anything to break the endless monotony of python at university
[22:35:37] <Jacobis9000> That professor is really good
[22:35:43] <shka> Also, computer science in general seems to be a pretty bad shape currently.
[22:35:50] <gilberth> The goal of education at university should not be about any particular language, but about computer science.
[22:36:00] <selwyn> what gilberth said
[22:36:20] <selwyn> but to the extent possible, it should be about good languages
[22:36:39] <shka> could be also about a bad languages
[22:36:51] <ln43> yes basically good courses mostly have a large amount of pseudocode only
[22:36:51] <selwyn> theres enough time to learn corpo languages when its time to get a job. why make yourself suffer for the better part of 3 years
[22:36:57] <shka> "Current class is about why PHP sucks big dick"
[22:37:08] <ln43> i should say are language independant 
[22:37:26] <ln43> or agnostic 
[22:37:27] <Jacobis9000> There are also MIT Computer Science lectures available on Apple Podcasts, in which the language is python, and the tutor criticises Python from the perspective of Lisp being originally a Lisp programmer
[22:37:30] <selwyn> shka: lol
[22:38:00] <White_Flame> Jacobis9000: heh, cool
[22:38:13] <selwyn> jacobis9000: you may also find such criticism on #lispcafe from time to time :)
[22:38:13] <shka> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQjoayRUvTs ;-}
[22:38:13] -ixelp- The Clash - Hateful (Official Audio) - YouTube
[22:38:34] <Jacobis9000> for example, he doesn't like the + operator or the * operator being overloaded for string concatenation in Python
[22:38:38] <shka> wait a moment
[22:38:54] <shka> I HAVE OPPORTUNITY TO SHIT ON PYTHON
[22:39:15] <shka> Jacobis9000: ["oh god why"][False]
[22:39:28] <ln43> buti don't consider python as a bad language since replaced perl in a large amount for the application of system scripting in addition to the other classic shell scripts almost ubiquitous 
[22:39:39] <shka> also 
[22:39:42] <shka> True*5
[22:39:57] <selwyn> i have never really used perl but i like the look of it
[22:40:05] <shka> True*"no please"
[22:40:14] <ln43> i like the style of its inventor
[22:40:22] <Jacobis9000> I have trouble with Python, I cannot make my head think in the way the designers of Python did/do
[22:40:36] <shka> seriously, python is almost like C++ in one regard
[22:40:50] <Jacobis9000> But I quite like it nonetheless, I prefer Lisp already
[22:40:59] <shka> it demonstrates how shitty interactions of features make a language complete shit
[22:41:09] <selwyn> and this is why proglang design is hard
[22:41:16] <ln43> but with python you could do almost everything even if maybe not in the same elegant way as with CL and then if one is not considering subtilies is good enough
[22:41:29] <selwyn> genuinely don't understand how common lisp got built. it seems to have very few unpleasant surprises
[22:41:33] <ln43> i mean from a practical point of view
[22:41:47] <shka> selwyn: i would argue that you have so much of good and bad examples that it is only your choice to make a crappy designs
[22:42:09] <selwyn> hard to think of bad lisp examples?
[22:42:32] <Jacobis9000> is there a way to print your function in the REPL, as in, its contents? I tried (symbol-function my-function) with no success
[22:42:32] <shka> common lisp is a product of evolution
[22:42:34] <selwyn> do you mean, from the point of view of the committee designing the spec in 1984
[22:43:04] <shka> back in the 1984 lisp was advanced in a multiple dialects for multiple decades already
[22:43:08] <ln43> yes one big limitation of python is the GIL but currently there are not troubles with space and time limitations on modern processors and that is why maybe it's no more a big limitation
[22:43:23] <selwyn> jacobis9000: symbol-function does not do what you want it to do, there are implementation-specific ways to get this iirc
[22:43:28] <shka> that's why they figured out that operator overloading does not blends well with dynamic typing
[22:43:42] <selwyn> short answer is there can be a way to do this but you should not need to/want to
[22:43:59] <selwyn> shka: good point
[22:44:00] <shka> Jacobis9000: what is "contents"?
[22:44:14] <Jacobis9000> well I wrote the function hours ago, and before I write it in my notebook, I want to double check it is what it is in my mind
[22:44:18] <shka> assembly code or lisp code?
[22:44:23] <shka> ok, so lisp code
[22:44:32] <selwyn> sbcl can do this i think
[22:44:46] <shka> selwyn: even better, swank can do that i think
[22:44:48] <shka> let me check
[22:46:03] <Jacobis9000> I will just rewrite the function and test again
[22:46:33] <selwyn> jacobis9000: in general, functions (like the ones in the common lisp package) may exist only in memory, and not have their sources defined anymore (at least locally)
[22:47:01] <selwyn> so you cannot count on recovering a function source in general, which is i imagine partly why this functionality isn't supported by the common lisp standard
[22:47:29] <shka> yeah
[22:47:30] <selwyn> in general, it is the programmers responsibility to store code in files, where it can be edited/re-evaluated at will
[22:47:32] <shka> swank can do that
[22:47:54] <shka> Jacobis9000: (swank:find-definition-for-thing #'mapcar)
[22:48:12] <shka> but what selwyn is true
[22:48:31] <shka> selwyn said is true
[22:51:08] <Jacobis9000> I find emacs is inferior as a text editor, I am writing my functions in a notebook, or I guess I could just open vim in a new window
[22:51:40] <ln43> which notebook?
[22:52:01] <Jacobis9000> it is a red Moleskine notebook I reserve for technical subjects
[22:52:20] <ln43> a paper notebook?
[22:52:42] <Jacobis9000> Oh yeah I forget Americans call laptops notebooks
[22:53:03] <Jacobis9000> Yeah it's paper :D
[22:54:03] <ln43> ok, then try to rewrite the function you would like to reuse and modify later on a file... so it should be simpler
[22:54:52] <ln43> then load that file in the repl and all should be ready for you
[22:55:00] <ln43> to test and rectify 
[22:55:04] <Jacobis9000> you can load a file in the REPL?
[22:55:10] <ln43> for sure
[22:56:06] <ln43> but just to start maybe you should consider a quite usable CL environment such as Portacle (https://portacle.github.io/)
[22:56:25] <ln43> to malke your experience more pleasant and loss less time

[23:03:08] <Jacobis9000> I am using SBCL, emacs and slime
[23:03:59] <Jacobis9000> I think emacs is cool with its window system, but I am much quicker editing a file in vim
[23:05:25] <ln43> onceyou get used with the different keystrokes should be the same anyways
[23:05:30] <Jacobis9000> I like the way vim has two modes: one for inserting text, and one for traversing/editing the document
[23:05:42] <ln43> and for CL is generally preferred Emacs as editor
[23:06:19] <Jacobis9000> I think I'll download Portacle on my WinPC though

[23:18:21] <awolven> emacs 26.3 and 27.3 on windows both have a horrible bug
[23:18:35] <awolven> i don't think they test it
[23:26:12] <Jacobis9000> why, when I type ;comment on a blank line and press return for a newline, does emacs insert a load of tabs before my comment sending it halfway across the page?
[23:26:47] <Jacobis9000> spaces, sorry
[23:26:59] <Jacobis9000> forcing me to go up a line and delete them all, it's incredibly irritating
[23:29:50] <Jacobis9000> ah I've got around it using ;;
[23:30:42] <selwyn> developing common lisp on windows with portacle is nice
[23:31:27] <awolven> emacs 26 and 27 both have the same problem that your cursor will randomly jump to other buffers
[23:31:53] <awolven> it makes hacking intolerable
[23:32:34] <gilberth> Bugs, bugs, bugs. I wanted to use Cairo for blittering the CADR screen. When I set the CTM to scaling at .75 this crashes. When I use .76, all is fine.
[23:33:14] <awolven> is open genera still available?
[23:33:36] <gilberth> Symbolics is out of business.
[23:34:01] <awolven> we know.  but there was a download.
[23:34:13] <gilberth> You'll find it.
[23:37:03] <gilberth> Someone with too much time should make a ready to boot VM image, as setting up NFS and such is not that easy with Open Genera. I'll do my best for the CADR simulator though.
[23:39:41] <ck_> I thought there was an ISO image with exactly that kind of setup on it -- at least that's what Reti says he uses in one of the videos
[23:42:42] <gilberth> That sounds nice.
[23:42:46] <Jacobis9000> what are the files emacs are creating with a tilde on the end?
[23:43:15] <gilberth> Which reminds me I still have to find that CLX patch for Open Genera.
[23:43:24] <gilberth> Jacobis9000: That are backup files.
[23:43:39] <Jacobis9000> it makes backups?
[23:43:58] <gilberth> Yes, of the previous version of that file when you save it.
[23:44:39] <Jacobis9000> so my exercises folder is going to fill up with loads of backups, if I keep saving editing then saving my files?
[23:44:40] <gilberth> So when you save foo.lisp, the previous foo.lisp becomes foo.lisp~ on the disk
[23:45:06] <gilberth> Usually only one backup is kept.
[23:46:47] <gilberth> Jacobis9000: You may also spot a #foo.lisp# file, that is an auto save file.
[23:47:38] <gilberth> For when the machine crashes, which happens to me every 100 days or so as I use this toy mocOS.
[23:48:18] <Jacobis9000> I have had one crash in 3 years so far
[23:48:22] <Jacobis9000> On the Mac
[23:48:57] <Jacobis9000> Couple of times I've had to restart due to being unable to resolve a problem, like not finding the printer
[23:49:03] <gilberth> My machines need a reboot every 100 or so days, I can't keep them up longer for some reason.
[23:49:15] <Jacobis9000> Oh I reboot once a week
[23:50:03] <gilberth> Jacobis9000: I would count that sort of thing a crash too. Not technically, but the machine suffered from Alzheimer then. One of my boxes keeps forgetting about it's audio once in a while.
[23:50:08] <Jacobis9000> I shut down the WinPC every night
[23:50:12] <Jacobis9000> the Mac sleeps though
[23:50:38] <gilberth> Jacobis9000: See. So, you don't know how long it would keep up.
[23:50:45] <Jacobis9000> No I don't lol
[23:51:15] <gilberth> My Linux box has an uptime of only 729. I needed to move it then as I got a new heating system for the house.
[23:51:19] <Jacobis9000> I was going to play videogames tonight, I spent all day in work doing a CBTp course
[23:51:22] <gilberth> 729 days.
[23:52:08] <Jacobis9000> but instead I am learning lisp
[23:52:18] <gilberth> In two weeks I would need to take it down again, as I get a new electricity meter and thus power will be cut.
[23:52:40] <Jacobis9000> Why are you determined to keep your machines running for a long time?
[23:52:45] <gilberth> Jacobis9000: Well, learning Lisp is better than any video game.
[23:52:50] <Jacobis9000> Are you hosting a web server?
[23:53:25] <gilberth> Jacobis9000: Why should I reboot for no reason?

[23:54:05] <Jacobis9000> For Windows, rebooting is almost essential, for Macs, it is good practice to reboot regularly

[23:54:34] <gilberth> Jacobis9000: Yes, that is a sign of being a toy.
