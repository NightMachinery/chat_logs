[00:00:01] <Sayona> programmerq, no hint
[00:00:53] <Sayona> but now I see is working
[00:01:00] <programmerq> that doesn't look like the logs of the container? exit 1 is a status code that is being sit by whatever tini is calling (that looks like truncated docker ps -a output?)
[00:02:01] <Sayona> yes

[01:42:25] <ash_worksi> GunArm: tags are arbitrary; just based on the builder's decision, these are typically elaborated in the description when there are variants. For ideas on what those tags mean, see "Rootless" and "Image Variants" in the description: https://hub.docker.com/_/docker

[01:44:05] <ash_worksi> but take head in the warning under "What is Docker in Docker" and check out the blog to make sure you really need what you think you need.
[01:44:15] <ash_worksi> heed*
[01:45:52] <GunArm> i actually don't want DIND if it can be helped, I want the more recommended sharing of the docker engine socket
[01:46:11] <GunArm> I do that in linux with my own images I made when I saw how simple it was to set up
[01:46:25] <GunArm> windows is weirder though for anything in this space

[01:48:28] <ash_worksi> I... don't know about any of that. Are you just trying to get docker up and running on your local machine?

[02:14:00] <GunArm> nah, trying to get where I can run docker commands, in a jenkins build agent, which is a windows container on a windows docker server
[02:14:32] <GunArm> i do this for linux, to build docker images in a CI pipeline
[02:14:44] <GunArm> kinda wanted to avoid it for windows but now I have to
[02:15:21] <GunArm> in linux, instead of DIND, it's recommended to just install the docker client in a container, and then mount /var/run/docker.sock (something like that) as a volume, so the container can control the hosts docker engine
[02:16:18] <GunArm> the link i posted above shows them doing something similar but apparently they are sharing a named pipe instead of a unix socket (which makes sense), but then you go to the image they are doing that to, and it seems to actually think it's a full on DIND setup, so not sure
[02:17:17] <GunArm> but then really what I was originally asking was, whenever I run into these things and have to go on dockerhub and look at the images/tags, I always feel like the important information is hidden somehow.  like it's a strip club without the rules posted and you're supposed to know the ropes but I don't
[02:18:07] <GunArm> so i've ironically don't quite a lot of not-always-trivial docker hacking, but feel inept at browsing dockerhub

[02:53:16] <OpenBDSM> hello. Reading docs on logging drivers and got a few simple questions: 1. since docs mention that log-driver 'local' is generally preferred over default 'json-file' - are there any plans to change default value to it?

[15:27:58] <ikke> The latter

[17:03:01] <tabakhase> then streams likely actually arent what they think they are - "where do you do what how", dockerfile? compose file? copypasta of your shell-session.. needs some more context ;P

[17:08:09] <gebbione> i docker-compose exec in one of the running container
[17:08:30] <gebbione> then run the echo inside while log tailing from the host
[17:09:25] <tabakhase> exec is totally out of band yes, this is expected to "not work" (as the streams that are attached to the pid1 in your container have no clue at all about your sidehustle)
[17:10:51] <tabakhase> depending on the "why" - best fix is likely the compose run pattern - or as workaround some black bash magic in your entrypoint to merge the different streams &  the exec call to write to those watchers

[17:12:29] <tabakhase> guess that last step can to some extend be cheated by directly writing to the FD´s if known whos-who..
[17:12:52] <gebbione> thanks for explaining, i have no understanding of what happens underneath, so if i do a run instead of exec it should work?
[17:13:14] <gebbione> as all the other stuff you are mentioning is not something i m familiar with
[17:13:55] <tabakhase> "in clean" this is basically syslog ;-) - where various parts can be reimplemented or reused from other things
[17:14:55] <gebbione> ok not sure what this implies, my understanding was that any exec is running from the same process of the actual container
[17:15:00] <gebbione> and no differences should exist
[17:15:21] <tabakhase> "run" is a bit extra-special - so it doesnt deal good with all usecases -- but you can also work with normal "up" when setting the corresponding restart_policy so the thing runs/dies as needed

[17:47:17] <moo> so i now have multiple docker-compose files and lets say 3 of them contain service "nginx" but only one has hostname: nginx. yet somehow app connected to the same network as the 3 above will rotate through all 3 when trying to connect with http://nginx and pick their ip at random. is there easy way to fix that? i even confirmed 2 others have different hostname (random)

[17:56:26] <onur> Hi. I always end up with tons of dangling images and containers on my development machine and pruning them taking long time (and using tons of io). I wonder using btrfs storage driver would be better or worse for my use case?

[17:58:17] <moo> is there any way to easily fix this and stop them from "publishing" this name? 
[17:58:38] <moo> they all have unique hostnames set, but i also happen to have one i explicitly called "nginx" 
[17:59:06] <moo> and i'd want to always hit that one when calling http://nginx/ or so
[17:59:52] <tabakhase> moo hostname: kinda doesnt belong in there anyhow except in rare cases ;-)
[18:00:31] <moo> well i created bunch of web-apps (rails mostly) and each has unique hostname i can proxy_pass to . this works perfectly
[18:00:56] <moo> but then i have varnish trying to .host = "nginx"  and that fails bad :D
[18:01:35] <moo> because it will sometimes reach main nginx, sometimes random part of the apps above
[18:04:35] <tabakhase> something sounds rather odd in your setup... may want to draw up a whos-who and show some compose files cause kinda sounds like you are running into a problem that shouldnt need to be solved in the first place...
[18:05:03] <moo> ok i'll try to create samples a bit later, have to run for now, thanks

[21:05:35] <moo> tabakhase i made minimal version that replicates it https://github.com/ecdsa521/docker-testwtf
[21:11:21] <moo> in the app5 the DNS will return all 4 IPs (app1 to app4), in app1 it will only return app1, in app2 it will only return app2 etc
[21:12:19] <tabakhase> moo hm that still has the "problem that shouldnt be one" smell tho - and im not sure how 5 different apps play in there --- the usual setup-of-such-kind is ONE ingress (be it nginx, traefik, caddy or whoever) and you use the external network in the apps to "tap onto this" - for what apps dont care about names of ingress, and the ingress can use the "service.projectname" DNS just fine
[21:12:58] <tabakhase> or say, for sharing one big database or such things 
[21:13:48] <moo> also if i were to add another docker container to say app4's dockerfile, then that service will only see app4's nginx
[21:15:29] <moo> tbh its not strictly a problem because i don't need to contact nginx from inside app5 (its nginx contacts app5 by its own unique hostname) but its something i noticed randomly
[21:15:55] <programmerq> dob1: it's best practice for an image author to mark the location intended to be used for either persistent storage or temporary/cache needed at runtime with VOLUME. Then when someone goes to use that image, if they don't know what those are, they at least get anonymous volumes at that location, which keeps that data out of the container's write layer. Persistence and performance concerns can both
[21:15:58] <programmerq> be served by an anonymous volume, but yes-- it's still good practice for the user of an image to at least define persistence locations as named volumes explicitly at runtime.
[21:16:01] <moo> i can also rename "main" nginx to something else and use that when i really needed to
[21:16:11] <programmerq> it's nice to be able to pull and inspect an image and see what those locations are in the inspect output
[21:18:40] <moo> i feel like the service names should only be accessible by app1_nginx_1 here (and they are, but ALSO via just "nginx" for some reason)
[21:19:49] *** Quits: trevors (~trevors@user/trevors) (Quit: trevors)
[21:20:31] <tabakhase> moo key is rly you kinda should never have to worry about that path - so in general "it giving you the closest/best service it has to offer" is pretty much working by the book but as long as the actually important route "in" works this either "isnt an issue" OR i guess the clean thing would be to explicitly set a container name (not hostname) - but thats still ugly :D
[21:21:07] <moo> i want docker-compose to handle naming containers and it names it eg app1_nginx_1 and thats gooood
[21:21:30] <moo> so just rename main nginx and stop worrying? :P

[21:28:55] <moo> hm actually it kinda is a problem if i don't define links properly. say multiple docker-compose each has app and sphinx and both of them need to contact central database. 
[21:29:20] <moo> effect is that "app" in each docker-compose can ping "sphinx" and random one will return 
[21:29:55] <moo> can be mitigated by using links: or custom hostname for each sphinx
[21:32:06] <programmerq> you should not use links anymore. those have been deprecated for years.
[21:32:15] <moo> well... great ;D
[21:32:31] <tabakhase> moo yea links is super-dead :D
[21:32:38] <moo> custom hostnames then? 
[21:32:47] <moo> thats what i was doing tbh
[21:34:04] <programmerq> if you have multiple replicas of the same service, you are saying "I want multiple of this thing that is the exact same thing" so it won't matter which one you get when you connect using the service name. The dns discovery just returns multiple A records and the thing doing the lookup just uses one of them
[21:34:30] <tabakhase> moo and i dont see where the db-example has a problem there - and it will not return a random one as you very much noticed in your app2 example
[21:34:36] <programmerq> if you want to distinguish between instances, then it sounds like you may want to split things up-- so if your "main" nginx is different than a different one, use two services.
[21:34:46] <moo> no, i have eg. two completely separate sites, each with its own docker-compose, nginx, sphinx, memcached etc 
[21:35:10] <moo> but app from compose1 will have all "nginx" returned from all other compose files
[21:35:26] <programmerq> ah, that sounds like you might be using the same project name across different compose projects.
[21:35:41] <tabakhase> "in app1 it will only return app1" - those were your very own words 20 minutes ago
[21:35:44] <programmerq> unless you're trying to connect all those nginx instances to a common network
[21:36:12] <moo> there are at the moment two common networks, some things need that, some this

[21:36:31] *** Joins: Atque (~Atque@user/atque)
[21:37:02] <programmerq> for traefik, it configures the upstreams with the explicit ip address of the container by inspecting the containers and finding labels. it doesn't utilize the short name dns lookup. 
[21:37:10] <moo> tabakhase yes app1-nginx will only return app1-nginx. but if you look at app5 it is completely different service name, and THAT will return 4 diff nginx' from app1 to app4
[21:38:32] <moo> dns server in app5 will return four A records, for all of app1 to app4
[21:38:44] <programmerq> https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/compose-file-v2/#aliases - similar to the deprecated links, you can set a custom name using the alias option
[21:38:48] <programmerq> and alias isn't deprecated.
[21:39:45] <tabakhase> moo if thats what its connected to, thats precisely what you asked for pretty  much -- but you either "shouldnt ever need to contact nginx" in the first place -- and for the very rare case that you do, you wouldnt use "nginx" but a more precise name (there are subvariants with the project name as well as the network name hardcodeable names and network-aliases - so lotta ways to "pick the one" 
[21:39:46] <tabakhase> when time actually comes ((say, to flush a cache via api call or so)) - point remains, "in that case youll know the name much more precise than "some random nginx""
[21:40:27] <moo> yes right now i was using custom hostname: to reach specific sphinx so there wasn't strictly a problem at all
[21:40:37] <moo> i just noticed when i went to curl nginx/foo/ that completely diff nginx talked to me :)
[21:40:46] <tabakhase> maybe you just need to not call that one nginx, (what is software) but call it by the SERVICE its actually doing - if its called "ingress" cause its your ingress controller, you pretty much granted to only ever have one :P
[21:41:08] <moo> yea so for now plan is to rename the main nginx and only use that name once lol
[21:42:17] <tabakhase> same kinda applies to your apps, those likely are app/frontend/api or such, that the underlaying image is nginx noone rly cares (and that may change tomorrow anyhow)

[22:03:01] <tabakhase> bdax gets handed as arg to the entrypoint, and if you look in there, line 99 fires it off https://github.com/docker-library/wordpress/blob/fbc4dd7593dd0cf7a239348cb7ebcdcbf505286f/latest/php7.4/apache/docker-entrypoint.sh#L99
[22:03:29] <dob1> programmerq, ok thanks, now it's clear
[22:03:32] <bdax> ah right yeah, thank you tabakhase, so CMD always passes stuff to the ENTRYPOINT?
