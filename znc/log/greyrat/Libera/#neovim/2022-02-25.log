[02:08:15] <pyrho> It's not a (very/no)magic issue, I get a match (not nil) so the regexp is working

[12:39:29] <jade> How do you run neovim from checkout? Is it even possible? It seems like there's some generated runtime files and the rest are not copied into build, so one would need to install to a temp dir (thus impossible to run from checkout directly). Am I off base?

[13:38:21] <sunjonSenghanBri> read the entire message, you're skipping bits
[13:38:42] <arch_angel> line 315 is an "EOF"
[13:39:00] <arch_angel> to match the lua << EOF a couple hundred lines above
[13:39:31] <arch_angel> i dont think that is the problem, isn't it?
[13:40:01] <sunjonSenghanBri> well, it hides the problem
[13:40:12] <arch_angel> then how should I make it verbose?
[13:41:22] <sunjonSenghanBri> comment out half of that block; start vim; if it's still broken, uncomment and comment out the _other_ half

[20:37:26] <LeoNerd> *offtopic grumble* I wish programs would all get together and agree if <Ctrl-Backspace> will delete the space as well as the word, or just the word...

[20:47:40] <Bowuigi[m]> Then it is a Google Docs problem
[20:48:14] <Bowuigi[m]> The space shouldn't be deleted because such movement is realized to quickly rewrite the word under the cursor
[20:48:42] <LeoNerd> I know..
[20:48:50] <LeoNerd> Do you want to write that bug report for google, or should I? ;)
[20:49:13] <dundargoc> Why are you using Google Docs in the first place?
[20:49:17] <dundargoc> Reverse Uno Card
[20:49:44] <LeoNerd> Because it's the easiest and most pragmatic way to write up a small draft doc and have 3 people simultaneously edit / comment on it
[20:50:00] <LeoNerd> 3 people who are in different countries around the world
[20:50:46] <clason[m]> https://hedgedoc.org
[20:50:58] <clason[m]> or etherpad
[20:50:59] <LeoNerd> Yeah we sometimes use that too
[20:52:39] <dundargoc> Why are you communicating with other people?
[20:52:42] <dundargoc> Checkmate
[20:53:34] <LeoNerd> Because the Steering Committee is three people. If I was on my own I couldn't really be called a Committee, could I? ;)
[20:53:49] <dundargoc> ðŸ¤”
[20:54:16] <LeoNerd> "A committee is a body that takes minutes and wastes hours", is one of my favourite quotes
[20:54:59] <dundargoc> I mean, kinda feels like it.
[20:55:26] <LeoNerd> Another is "A committee is an odd structure, in which one must address the chair to reach the floor"
[20:57:03] <dundargoc> Chairming joke
