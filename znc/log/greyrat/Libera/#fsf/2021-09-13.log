[06:04:46] <lightbringer> i would hope Linux is still free software
[06:04:51] <jxself> Makes me think of https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/java-trap.en.html
[06:05:12] <joepublic> linux libre is free software.  linux is open source with nonfree bits.
[06:05:47] <lightbringer> are the nonfree bits still open source?
[06:06:03] <joepublic> you'd have to ask the open source folks about that, I guess
[06:06:16] <jxself> If you mean some philosophies behind the projects you may be right. Linus Torvalds, for a random example, doesn't seem to believe in software freedom based on interviews and the things he's said over the years. So he'd certainly fall into the more practical "open source because it's technically better" camp. At the same time, within each of the projects, you'll likely find contributors from both philosophical 
[06:06:21] <lightbringer> going by the OSD, they are
[06:06:23] <jxself> "sides" so that seems to make a generalization such as this hard to do beyond, say, the project founders.
[06:08:02] <joepublic> debian, for example, separates the nonfree bits fron linux and puts them into their nonfree repositories.
[06:08:24] <jxself> https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/drivers/net/appletalk/cops_ffdrv.h
[06:08:41] <jxself> I suspect that this series of numbers would also fail the OSD.
[06:10:45] <jxself> The lack of source code would go against #2 in the OSD.
[06:10:50] <jxself> And the whole "This material is licensed to you strictly for use in conjunction with the use of COPS LocalTalk adapters" would probably go against the whole "no discrimination against fields of endeavor" part of the OSD.

[06:22:21] <sasano> the non-free parts aren't free software nor open source but with decisions like this each project will judge it differently if we are talking about Linux specifically then anything that isn't specifically related to kernel code they have no interest in it for example firmware that is loaded on a chip can be in binary form because it has nothing to do with the kernel
[06:25:03] <sasano> I don't think that the GPL can be enforced against code that is merely copied by the kernel to some other device since the kernel does not execute it
[06:26:17] <joepublic> "code loaded" is software, regardless what processor it's running on (CPU, GPU, random device).
[06:27:20] <joepublic> And something a kernel driver depends on can honestly not be said to "have nothing to do with" that kernel driver.

[06:27:28] <sasano> joepublic, from a software freedom perspective that is correct
[06:27:36] <joepublic> well, software is our middle name.
[06:28:27] <sasano> but it isn't combined work with the GPL code so you can't enforce anything in this case
[06:29:16] <joepublic> I am not working to enforce a particular license; the issue is rather determining whether a particular piece of software is free software.
[06:29:54] <sasano> it isn't free
[06:30:01] <joepublic> bingo.
[06:31:44] <anton> how can linux, something free software, contain nonfree binaries?
[06:32:09] <sasano> sadly, I don't the GPL can be fixed to solve this particular case
[06:32:32] <anton> :(
[06:33:57] <joepublic> one way is that a kernel driver may only function if nonfree firmware is loaded onto the device it controls first; the nonfree firmware is therefore included in the kernel so the driver can load it into the device.
[06:34:01] <jxself> Depends on the situation obviously. Alexandre Oliva explains in his release announcement of Linux-libre 4.14 that, in some of the cases, they may very well be derivative works of the kernel, and a GPL violation.

[07:19:54] <kittyblam> a friend is wanting to dual boot, while I have no doubt if she gets into it she will be using an actual distro, anyone know something I could throw at her to start learning how to use it etc and to be able to go deeper in?

[07:31:51] <sasano> kittyblam, if they just want to try something less proprietary then any GNU/linux distro or */Linux is less proprietary than windows/os x

[13:21:04] <pagios> guys, how do you protect your code and sell it as a Saas?
[13:21:04] <pagios> can anyone give me some guidance
[13:23:51] <gerikson> pagios: are you serious or trolling ? 
[13:25:03] <pagios> i am serious
[13:25:30] <pagios> my code is pure server side and it does some stuff that i think will attract some customers, i was thinking of publishing it in aws and azure marketplace. So mainly what i do is i publish it and make it a subscription but the customers can still get root access to that code when they deploy it on a vm from the ami i shared?
[13:26:05] <gerikson> sorry for doubting you pagios 
[13:26:21] <gerikson> I am afraid I don't have an answer though

[14:53:16] <DiffieHellman> pagios: There's no such thing as "protecting code". It wants to be free. If such code is based off GPL code, distributing VMs without a matching offer for the source code will violate the GPL.
[14:54:24] <DiffieHellman> If you insist on keeping such program to yourself, your only option is to host it on your own server and then offer subscriptions to interface with such server.
[14:54:49] <White_Flame> if the customer has access to running it themselves (eg they root-manage an AWS instance with your source-code based software on it), you cannot "protect" it by technical means, only legal means (copyright etc)
[14:55:13] <DiffieHellman> Yes, that too.
[14:55:40] <White_Flame> however, I agree it's off-topic for fsf :-P
[14:55:48] <White_Flame> maybe even anti-topic
[14:56:02] <DiffieHellman> Yes, fsf isn't the best place to ask about selling proprietary software.

[16:26:27] <DiffieHellman> "Intellectual Property" does not exist. An idea is only yours intellectually if you keep it to yourself - the second you share that idea, that idea is available to others. "Imaginary Property" is a more accurate term anyway, as an idea is not property.
[16:29:13] <DiffieHellman> There's nothing special about trade secrets. If you were to open a tea shop for example (i.e. rms tea), your list of tea customers would be your trade secret. Keeping your trade secret is as simple as not giving away your list of tea customers.
[16:29:16] <gerikson> how about creative work, such as a painting or novel? 
[16:30:00] <gerikson> because "IP" originated with copyright which is a state-granted monopoly to exploit something intangible

[16:48:17] <kilobug> having to wait some years to publish your fanfiction or translation of a book/movie/video game isn't too harmful either for society nor individual; having your utility software controlled by someone who have the monopoly on fixing bugs/adding features is
[16:48:20] <DiffieHellman> Copyright was actually meant to promote the publishing of works. The state of copyright now seems to be promoting the idea that an author can make a single work and then keep milking that for life or a business can produce a single work and milk that for 150 years+.

[18:15:20] <ukine> "the interview" was funny, anyhow. heh.
[18:16:04] <sasano> DiffieHellman, I mean if the firmware is replaceable at all it is non-free, the exception is made for firmware that is not replaceable, that can be considered a circuit
[18:16:30] <sasano> though a "circuit" can be a stretch when we it runs an entire operating system
[18:17:23] <sasano> and this case a dead circuit with vulnerabilities is not something that we should celebrate or label as a "respects your freedom" thing

[18:26:02] <sasano> DiffieHellman, also point A about whether it is malicious, that is not as narrow as it may seem, a juicer that limits the user in software can be considered malicious

[18:32:34] <DiffieHellman> As long as the juicer operates as you would expect a juicer to, any firmware isn't malicious.

[18:37:58] <DiffieHellman> I only really brought up a juicer as small processors are often cheaper than a pure relay implementation when it comes to implementing appliance functions. Due to the small processor, these appliances have firmware, but such firmware can always be treated as a circuit as long as the appliance isn't 
[18:38:13] <DiffieHellman> "smart" and operates as expected.
[18:38:14] <sasano> If you want to known if something is free or non-free simply answer the question: If I have the source code and can modify and reinstall the software can I do something valuable with it? if the answer is yes and you don't have the source code or can't reinstall then it is non-free.
