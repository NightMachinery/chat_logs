[21:18:06] <technomancy> isn't C++-on-.NET a thing?
[21:18:25] <technomancy> feels like that probably goes a long way towards appealing to gamedevs
[21:19:33] <Para> Gamedev is traditionally almost entirely Windows based.
[21:19:39] <Para> That's where the market, money and skills are.
[21:19:57] <goodger> it is, but it has to be sufficiently different from normal C++ to make it unappealing to use in place of C#
[21:20:35] <Para> Moving from Windows C++ to C# isn't that much of a leap and definitely something the old crusty beards appreciated. In fact there's a video from GDC where Remedy's lead tools programmer explains how they rebuilt their entire production pipeline with C# moving away from clunky inhouse C++ tools.
[21:21:04] <technomancy> seems like it could allow a much more gradual change than C++->Java

[21:24:03] <ridcully> i have no clue on the other hand how CLR (or unity) adresses GC
[21:24:17] <technomancy> Godot has a *lot* of catching up to do based on the credibility it lost by sticking with their awful GDscript for so long
[21:24:29] <technomancy> imagine telling people to use a language that doesn't have closures
[21:24:39] <jeaye> Unity games, these days, actually compile CLR IL to C++, then to native code, using a Unity-built tool called IL2CPP.
[21:24:48] <austincheney> a reputation for slowness as in people time or execution time?
[21:24:57] <technomancy> austincheney: bad vibes from applets =)
[21:25:01] <goodger> execution
[21:25:53] <austincheney> my experience in the big corporate world is generally the opposite.  It takes Java developers ages to do incredibly trivial things, but the finished product seems to scale well on the server hardward (or so they claim)
[21:26:21] <technomancy> austincheney: well, the JVM was also created by a company that sold servers
[21:26:51] <technomancy> it has historically always performed well when you deploy it on a machine where it's literally the only thing running and it stays running for days
[21:28:18] <technomancy> and game devs are extremely paranoid about GC pauses, even though concurrent GC on the JVM has been a thing for a long time it takes even longer to shift peoples' perception
[21:28:50] <goodger> doesn't the CLR use the same tracing-based GC as the JVM?
[21:29:06] *** Joins: desantra (~skykanin@user/skykanin)
[21:29:21] <technomancy> I assume if you can run C++ on the CLR then the GC must be optional?
[21:29:53] <jeaye> Really depends on the game, as to whether the GC will be an issue.
[21:29:55] <technomancy> I'm not trying to make an argument; just trying to understand the thought process of gamedevs whose minds have been ruined by C++
[21:30:01] <goodger> :D
[21:30:24] <technomancy> maybe the problem with this whole question is it assumes game devs make rational decisions to begin with
[21:31:09] <jeaye> 61% of mobile games are made in Unity; mobile games are typically not twitch shooters where 1ms is a big concern.

[21:34:26] <technomancy> lol yeah there's plenty of reasons to be skeptical of the JVM honestly
[21:34:45] <technomancy> I mean, it's a runtime that's owned by goddamn oracle
[21:35:20] <goodger> (it might support automatic reference counting)
[21:35:58] <goodger> do you think cognitect backed the wrong horse with the JVM, technomancy?
[21:36:30] <technomancy> welllll it gets the job done
[21:36:52] <technomancy> I think it's a bad idea for any one person to work exclusively on a tech stack owned by oracle, sure
[21:37:00] <technomancy> as one tool in your toolbelt, it's fine
[21:37:02] <Para> I wouldn't say so, at least. Sun Microsystems is the one who decided to eat their own horse in the middle of the race.
[21:37:23] <technomancy> Para: Cognitect and Sun Microsystems were not contemporaries
[21:37:40] <goodger> sun was acquired in 2010
[21:37:43] <Para> My point is, Java under Sun didn't seem such a terrible choice. At least compared to what we have now.
[21:37:54] <Para> When did Hickey start working on Clojure?
[21:37:58] <goodger> oh, the deal was announced in 09
[21:38:14] <goodger> 2005-ish?
[21:38:27] <technomancy> didn't go public until 2008 or so, but Cognitect came along much later
[21:38:47] <technomancy> 2013
[21:38:57] <Para> I wonder what would even been an option back then as alternate runtime. Or just go native?
[21:39:06] *** Joins: wonko (~wjc@user/wonko)
[21:39:24] <technomancy> back then the gnome people were pushing hard on Mono
[21:39:32] <technomancy> for roughly this reason
[21:39:59] <goodger> the gnome people were pushing hard on mono because miguel de icaza wanted to work for microsoft
[21:40:58] <technomancy> no one could have imagined back then that Actual .NET would have been released under a free license; they were all terrified of patent suits
[21:42:12] <technomancy> lmao the photo for Rich's wikipedia page was taken at that one SF meetup hosted by Tom Faulhauber where the projector didn't work right and turned everything bright magenta https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rich_Hickey
[21:42:47] <goodger> I was hoping to see a magenta rich hickey
[21:42:52] <schmudde> oh that's always a pleasant projector surprise, when it goes into a high-def CGA mode.
[21:43:38] <technomancy> I think the Q&A at that session was the last time I heard Rich talk about self-hosting
[21:43:46] <Para> goodger: Epic Hickey
[21:43:48] <goodger> I wonder why, when VGA fails, it always loses its green channel first
[21:44:03] <Para> (not to be confused with https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epic_Mickey)
[21:44:05] <technomancy> gives it character
[21:44:18] <goodger> perhaps that's just one of the end pins on the D-subminiature connector
