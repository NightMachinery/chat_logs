[00:33:36] <no_gravity> Strange, this is not a normal 128: ‎128
[00:33:56] <no_gravity> When I paste it into a file and watch it in a hex editor, it looks different than a normal 128.
[00:34:00] *** Joins: nekobyte (~nekobyte@user/nekobit)
[00:34:06] <no_gravity> How can I figure out what is up with it?
[00:34:53] <no_gravity> This is how "od" shows a normal 128:
[00:35:00] <no_gravity> 0000000 031061 005070
[00:35:00] <no_gravity> 0000004
[00:35:08] <pavonia> It has an U+200E LEFT-TO-RIGHT MARK in front of it, so probably another font is chosen
[00:35:24] <no_gravity> pavonia: How do you know?
[00:35:30] <no_gravity> This is how "od" shows this magic 128:
[00:35:37] <no_gravity> 0000000 100342 030616 034062 000012

[00:36:08] <pavonia> I have an Unicode expanation tool that show this
[00:36:17] <beaky> nice reminds me to properly configure my unicode
[00:37:09] <no_gravity> pavonia: But how did you put my 128 into your tool? Did you copy it from irc?
[00:37:25] <pavonia> Yes, I copied it from the client
[00:37:27] <GeDaMo> I selected the text then used xclip
[00:37:34] <no_gravity> pavonia: Interesting
[00:37:45] <no_gravity> So you can post invisible chars to irc?
[00:38:08] <pavonia> Sure, if the server handles it
[00:38:17] <beaky> yes for example many bots use like invisible spaces to prevent accidentally pinging people
[00:38:26] <beaky> or see that hamradio spam thing
[00:38:31] <no_gravity> Thats spooky.
[00:38:57] <no_gravity> So a single word like "hello" could contain megabytes of hidden data?

[07:59:04] <nshire> could a program verify its own integrity via checksum on startup? this hypothetical checksum would be stored in the executable, not with an external file

[08:04:39] <^[> nshire: Your use of "checksum" instead of "signature" makes it sound like you're interested in checking for corruption rather than purposeful modifications.

[12:52:55] <teut> so what  is windows asking me when it asks me to install a 32 bit or 64 bit?
[12:53:10] <GeDaMo> The CPU you have can run in 32-bit mode or 64-bit mode
[12:53:13] <teut> people say 64 bit is safe
[12:53:22] <GeDaMo> 64-bit mode can access more RAM in your machine
[12:53:38] <teut> yes that is what I have heard as one of the points
[12:53:55] <GeDaMo> 32-bit is limited to 4GB although there are workarounds
[12:55:27] <alycidyne> teut: 64-bit vs 32-bit here mostly refers to the size of addresses used by programs, along with those of certain other data types
[12:55:49] <alycidyne> teut: which is where the difference in usable RAM comes from
[12:56:07] <GeDaMo> Unless you have a really good reason to install the 32-bit version of your OS, you should go with 64-bit
[12:56:07] <teut> another thing that I heard was  the reason why you cant run 64 bit programs on 32 bits machine but the  vice-versa   is possible.  I heard that its because you can store 32 bit numbers in 64  bits  by padding with zeros  but if you try to put a 64 bit number in 32 bit space , that  would not be possible
[12:57:22] <Trashlord> hmmm?
[12:57:26] <Trashlord> you can kinda do it
[12:57:32] <Trashlord> I would think, at least
[12:57:50] <Trashlord> since it IS possible to calculate numbers which require a higher amount of bits to represent them
[12:57:58] <teut> but the os  needs the algorithm to split your 64 bit number in set of 32 bits, right?
[12:57:59] <Trashlord> 64 bit machines can calculate 128 bit numbers, or more
[12:58:25] <Trashlord> maybe it just requires more memory to the point that it's unfeasable, I don't knoww

[15:49:45] <CalimeroTeknik> ah, actually I'm looking for an algorithm that looks for all *non-overlapping* common substrings in two strings, prioritizing the longest
[15:50:31] <CalimeroTeknik> but that doesn't make much difference on the structure of the problem I guess? hmm
[15:51:18] <mrig> pyzozord: certainly rings true for me too, that and also profoundly loving gadgets; There is a great deal of gadgetry involved in programming; Number one gadget being the automaton :D
[15:52:56] <pyzozord> mrig: :)
[15:54:25] <CalimeroTeknik> what is not a gadget?
[15:56:04] <pyzozord> It's very amaturish philosophy but I came to conclusion that everyone wants to be asserted that their lives matter. And the only way to do that is to inflict a change on the world. I think making an action and observing a reaction is fundamentally satisfying to us because it sends a signal "you did this, you are here, you live, this wouldn't happen if not for you". So I think creativity is just a 
[15:56:10] <pyzozord> good way to channel that need for validation of existance
[15:56:40] <pyzozord> and computers are a perfect platform for creativity

Most people are attracted to "power" (potential to chang) over people. Artists and engineers I think are often pursuing "power" over a specific thing, canvas and paint, computers etc.

[16:07:57] <CalimeroTeknik> pyzozord, the opposite mentality exists. I attempt to have as little effect as I can, because each of my actions has *too much effect*

[16:11:20] <mrig> I like to get into and go with the flow of time, neither exerting nor resisting.
[16:11:50] <CalimeroTeknik> so… gadgets are solutions to problems whose mathematical model isn't satisfyingly small and generic?
[16:12:01] <pyzozord> CalimeroTeknik: thinking about what you said, would you still like to minimize your impact on the world if your change was positive in all aspects for everyone and everything?

[17:05:50] <RubberDuck13> See, these "developers" have an aversion to readable code and documentation which can only be described as water and fire
[17:06:26] <PlanckWalk> That last word may be useful :-p
[17:06:50] <RubberDuck13> Believe me, once we refactored this "code base", some one will be getting fired.
[17:06:59] <W> my solution is generally speaking to quit
[17:07:05] <RubberDuck13> We are still debating if that we be figuratively or literally

[17:08:25] <RubberDuck13> No, that doesn't work. They are the only ones who understand the hot mess
[17:08:35] <immibis> (but is it possible their previous boss was really insistent on adding things and ignoring bugs?)
[17:08:52] <RubberDuck13> No, just too busy to pay attention to it
[17:09:06] <immibis> so are you in charge or are you one of the developers?

[17:09:53] <Hitchens> Link: Big ball of mud - Wikipedia
[17:10:18] <RubberDuck13> Having to explain code practices, testing, talking to other stake holders about how to perform these tests.
[17:10:35] <RubberDuck13> But some are really working against me
[17:10:57] <RubberDuck13> And causing massive deadlocks and memory leaks with their "code"
[17:11:09] <RubberDuck13> but we can't throw that away due to it being a core product
[17:11:28] <RubberDuck13> And our clients are pissed, but they can't drop it either as it's interwoven into their infrastructure
[17:11:40] <W> RubberDuck13, if you have _some_ authority as a devops guy, automate rules as much as possible. Put in code quality checkers that are called in commit hooks, for instance, so they don't get any work done if they insist on writing poor code.
[17:11:55] <W> lock down deployment so it goes through you and systems you control
[17:12:20] <RubberDuck13> Had that, was overruled by management as it stopped all production for that product
[17:12:29] <W> make it the system they but their head against, the computer, not you as a person, which they can ignore if you get annoying
[17:12:38] <W> RubberDuck13, then you don't have such authority

[17:14:33] <mrig> So that is a positive.
[17:14:43] <W> consider that the company is in this state because of the people that deny you authority and how they have used their own authority in the past

[17:19:37] <RubberDuck13> Yeah, going to work on a lot of refactors and removing certain "elements" this summer. It's just that this is the worst example that I have ever seen, and I have seen terrible stuff at certain fortune 500 companies.
[17:20:15] <W> hopefully they pay you well :)
[17:20:20] <soobnauce> hm... wikipedia says BNF calls it <symbol> ::= __expression__ so I'll call it that
[17:20:40] <mrig> RubberDuck13: the worst of the rot will make dammed sure that you think that the rot is elsewhere, with the same skill that they obfuscate the code.
[17:20:49] <mrig> difficult task.
[17:21:11] <mrig> there be mambas in them fruit trees.
[17:21:16] <RubberDuck13> Yeah, hardest part will be fixing them or removing them as they are so entrenched
[17:21:56] <mrig> you will never change one of those, cant fix what aint broken.
[17:22:25] <W> if management overrules you on simply instituting quality controls, they're definitely going to overrule you on any firing
[17:22:37] <mrig> self preservation is not strictly speaking a fault.

[17:24:22] <RubberDuck13> Well yeah, that's also true
[17:25:26] <W> way I see it is, the question of the competence and fit of an employee ended when the company decided to hire them, as long as the candidate didn't lie; after that it's a matter for the company to train them if they want something other than what they knew (or should have known) they hired

[21:49:06] <GeDaMo> Protein folding too
[21:50:23] <W> And today's rant topic is email. If you write software that sends out email, please understand the nature of the multipart system, and how to provide both HTML and plain text versions of your email. This does not need to be more complicated than simply using an email library that already have done this, and having two templates for each email (you probably want multiple templates anyway, for internationalization)
[21:50:29] <W> GeDaMo, that was mostly what I was thinking of
[21:51:08] <mrig> It is remarkable how much the slime moulds resemble electricity burning through wood.

[22:17:38] <W> (if you send it with the right content-type I mean - email client finds no text/plain content, does not display anything. This way it at least displays the HTML source)
[22:18:41] <pyzozord> im not sure did they send html source under text/plain?
[22:18:55] <W> yes

[22:19:54] <pyzozord> oh ok, I see how that is irritating, big corps should hold themselves to a higher standard
[22:20:43] <piou> I remember doing that the first time I wrote phishing mails, then I noticed that android's mail preview in the notification displayed html rather than text so every mail sent since then had a proper text version.
[22:21:05] <piou> It's kind of annoying when phishing is done with more care than actual business mail
[22:22:28] *** night_wulfe_ is now known as night_wulfe
[22:22:44] <GeDaMo> Phishing is more important than business email :P
[22:22:54] <W> npm does appear to have multiple libraries able to create multipart mime messages, but none that provide the convenience method of just plonking in HTML and text streams
[22:23:21] <GeDaMo> Presumably you still have to tell the library what the content is

[22:24:48] <pyzozord> sending html as plain/text is pretty amaturish no matter how you look at it
[22:25:34] <pyzozord> with just a bit of english you can tell that html is not "plain text"
[22:26:42] <elf_fortrez> html socket snippet please
[22:27:08] <pyzozord> and when I say something is pretty amaturish, then it's actually amaturish squared :P

[22:32:11] <GeDaMo> But if you tell it that HTML source is plain text, what's a library to do? :P
[22:32:51] <pyzozord> Then the library runs the annoyW() function

[23:48:22] <GeDaMo> Could you fit it in under 100 bytes, say?
[23:48:42] <pyzozord> single unit? I bet they could
[23:49:11] <GeDaMo> So 100 megabytes roughly, that doesn't seem so much nowadays
[23:49:59] <pyzozord> Although maybe more then 100 bytes, I think the position will be two 32 or 64 bit floats, rest can be probably much smaller
