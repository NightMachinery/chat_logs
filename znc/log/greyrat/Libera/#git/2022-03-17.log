[01:49:09] <wakeup> are you saying that we modify the last commit by doing git commit --amend by integrating the changes that we made to index?
[01:49:25] <rewt> let's say you have commit A that adds a file, and commit B that deletes that file... the end result is the file is gone... if you squash those commits, the end result is as if the file was never added in the first place... --amend effectively does the commit+squash in 1 step
[01:49:28] <wakeup> in other words, git commit ammend will change the last commit with the new index?
[01:49:48] <j416> the index represents a tree of files and directories; removing a file updates that tree to reflect this. Commit creates a commit from the tree of the index. --amend does the same except it replaces the last commit with the new commit.
[01:49:58] <rewt> wakeup, yes
[01:50:26] <wakeup> ha ok
[01:50:32] <wakeup> I understand now
[01:50:33] <wakeup> thanks
[01:50:43] <wakeup> so, ok, let me just make reiterate
[01:51:06] <wakeup> we first modify the index then we change the last commit with amend
[01:51:18] <wakeup> but why do some people suggest to use git reset?
[01:51:22] <j416> https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Recording-Changes-to-the-Repository
[01:51:42] <j416> there are many ways to achieve the same thing.
[01:52:04] <j416> you can reset and redo the commit, or amend the commit.
[01:52:35] <wakeup> so reset will bring head back and we need to commit again while git commit amend will not redo the whole commit but just amend it
[01:52:57] <j416> it will redo the commit, but it'll take the metadata from the old one.
[01:53:01] <wakeup> while, at this level of description, it's not clear with git commit amend really does, but I understand that there might be more than one way to do this
[01:53:36] <j416> commits are immutable.
[01:54:59] <j416> in that, you cannot change them without modifying their hash, but you can create a new similar commit with your new changes
[01:55:15] <j416> and replace the old one with the new one. This is what --amend does for you.

[01:57:27] <wakeup> ok

[01:58:22] <j416> sure. or rebase. or replace. or filter-branch.

[14:39:31] <Schrostfutz> Hi, sometimes have feature branches that built on each other. Is there an easier way to rebasing them onto an updated master than rebasing the 'longest' one and then resetting the labels of previous branches to the appropriate commits manually?
[14:40:23] <osse> You should be able to rebase the others also.

[14:47:33] <Schrostfutz> osse: I am, but since they are included in the other branch that is not necessary. I have branches master > a > b > c. I can rebase a, b, & c indivudally to a', b', & c'. But I can also just rebase c to c', and reset the labels of a & b to the new commits, I was hoping there might be an automated way for that

[14:48:06] <osse> Schrostfutz: I was just saying that if you rebase a and b the effect would be the same as a reset

[14:48:22] <Schrostfutz> osse: Ah, true.

[21:38:49] <jast> also, just changing this doesn't affect existing files, so if some files still have CRLF in the repo, you have to re-add and re-commit them after you've set up your new .gitattributes

[21:41:13] <Guest92> In my case, if a Windows user was to commit CRLF, I actually would like git to enforce it being CRLF but the other way is fine too. If possible I would prefer textual diffs to still work nicely.
[21:43:34] <Guest92> So if I temporarily remove the .csv files and commit that, then add them back with LF line endings and a .gitattributes file with `*.csv text eol=lf` then it should work right? And as long as I'm on that most recent commit with no working directory changes, the line endings should be LF?

[21:46:15] <jast> if you want Windows users to be able to use CRLF locally, just put "*.csv text"
[21:46:28] <jast> that way the client can decide which line ending format to present to the user
[21:46:37] <jast> and the repo itself will have everything normalized to LF

[21:47:45] <jast> shouldn't even be necessary to remove and re-add the files, try just running "git add" on them. if the line endings were incorrect in the repo, they should show up as modified in "git status" afterwards
[21:49:07] <Guest92> No, I don't think that's what I mean. I want the working directory to reflect exactly what is in the git repo; I don't want git to be messing about with line endings at all for these files no matter what platform they're cloned on.
[21:49:31] <jast> so you want the same file to switch around between LF and CRLF if both Windows and Linux users commit to it?
[21:50:20] <jast> that's what will happen if you don't want git to do anything at all to line endings - one person's editor will convert the file in one direction and the next person's editor will convert it right back
[21:50:24] <jast> makes for fun diffs and conflicts
[21:50:49] <Guest92> No. But if any user accidentally uses a different line ending, I want git to track that change exactly as it was in the working directory.

[21:51:54] <jast> this forcibly turns off normalization even if a client has it enabled by default
[21:52:28] <Guest92> Ok, I don't think I've tried that option yet. Will do.
[21:52:34] <jast> the problem with "binary" is that it also stops outputting readable diffs and conflict markers and such
[21:53:30] <jast> and, in fact, turns off automatic merging altogether
[21:53:50] <Guest92> Yeah, I've had that annoyance too.
