[05:15:49] <dwarring> results...

[05:18:01] <dwarring> The count is of LibXML native objects, which get freed when DESTROY is called
[05:19:18] <dwarring> call to DESTROY isn't being missing and is tending to get called earlier

[05:34:24] <dwarring> I haven't used the c++ bindings myself

[06:16:52] <dominix> hi everyone, quick question, what do you guy have as newsfeed regarding Rakulang ? 
[06:16:54] <tellable6> 2020-09-28T01:49:13Z #raku <tbrowder> dominix: what kind of package sys does clear linux use? is it fedora or debian based?
[06:16:54] <tellable6> 2020-09-28T01:56:01Z #raku <tbrowder> dominix: never mind. i see the problem i would have with clear linux. i, being retired, would have the luxury of telling my client "no" to clear linux, but he's paying for that agony.
[06:16:55] <tellable6> 2020-09-28T01:57:37Z #raku <tbrowder> dominix: but your client wants you to use raku? maybe client will pay for a clear linux raku pkg.
[06:16:55] <tellable6> 2020-09-28T08:08:22Z #raku <El_Che> dominix It looks like Clear Linux uses flatpack as pkg format. Timotimo just release a rakudo release oin that format
[06:16:55] <tellable6> 2020-09-28T08:15:54Z #raku <El_Che> dominix: nevr mind about the flatpack. However precompiled non-pkg release can be found here: https://github.com/nxadm/rakudo-pkg/releases/tag/v2020.09, just untar-gzip this: rakudo-pkg-mooarvm-2020.09-01-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
[06:19:15] <kybr> how about if i wanted to get a reference to the function/method with the string name in $function?
[06:20:09] <timo> that depends on how you can reach it. it mayb e enough to just get my $func-obj = ::($function)

[17:47:17] <raydiak> not exciting enough though
[17:49:57] <raydiak> people rowing a boat over the edge of a waterfall is more exciting, but the connotations are a bit negative
[17:50:47] <tib> Announcing Stephane Gigandet at the ephemeral miniconf: https://dev.to/thibaultduponchelle/the-ephemeral-miniconf-speaker-annoucement-314d
[18:00:09] <lizmat> And yet another Rakudo Weekly News hits the Net: https://rakudoweekly.blog/2021/08/30/2021-35-superseding/
[18:01:16] <tib> lizmat ++
[18:04:15] <raydiak> one real idea, perhaps something similar to https://thisadventurelife.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/para.png would be appropriate and resonate with our predominantly european community?
[18:04:30] <raydiak> lizmat++ thank you as always for the weekly
[18:05:06] <lizmat> raydiak: that does not convey the feeling of "we're all in this together"
[18:05:14] <lizmat> at least not to me
[18:05:27] <raydiak> hm. does but doesn't. I do see what you're saying

[18:07:28] <raydiak> they're all doing the same thing in the same direction, but independently. whether that's more appropriate or less, is a matter of opinion :)
[18:08:02] <raydiak> anyway, that's all I had for now. been up all night. good * lizmat and #raku o/
[18:09:23] <lizmat> good * to you too, raydiak

[23:41:46] <moon-child> lizmat: any idea about the error message there?
[23:42:31] <kybr> lizmat: thank you. i need to look into what ::() does. yesterday i had a question about how to get a reference to a built-in function/method given its name as a string.

[23:42:59] <lizmat> moon-child: apparently the $op is interpolated at compile time if you write it like that
[23:43:12] <lizmat> so that's before the "+" assignment, hence the error message
[23:43:27] <moon-child> ahh, I see
[23:44:04] <moon-child> oh, right, of course
