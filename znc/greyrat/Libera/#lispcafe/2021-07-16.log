[14:50:29] <hayley> What would you do to get microcontrollers talking to each other on one wire, something like Ethernet but not really that?
[14:50:51] * hayley tries not to think Chaosnet 2
[14:52:09] <SAL9000> hayley: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1-Wire ?
[14:52:36] <hayley> Okay, not one wire, one shared bus which probably involves a shared ground. Poor wording.
[14:53:50] <humasect> usb >
[14:53:51] <humasect> ?
[14:54:13] <hayley> Though I see it has a master node and I haven't decided if that would be suitable.
[14:54:14] <SAL9000> hayley: well the 1-wire protocol is not in fact one wire :)
[14:54:46] <SAL9000> humasect: usb requires at least 4 wires - pwr gnd d+ d-
[14:54:59] <humasect> ohh
[14:55:01] <SAL9000> (I'm not sure if pwr is optional)
[14:55:06] <humasect> parallel or serial =) 
[14:55:35] <hayley> Not going that fast either. Hell, maybe just using the UARTs with some collision detection would work? Probably not.
[14:55:42] <SAL9000> and usb can't be chained -- it is a one-to-one link only (modulo hubs)
[14:55:51] <humasect> hm you'll have to make custom 
[14:55:52] <humasect> ahh
[14:56:14] <shka> arguably, chaining is a niche case
[14:56:23] <SAL9000> hayley: UART + exponential backoff + some pullup/pulldown wizardry might work?
[14:56:32] <hayley> Right.
[14:56:34] <SAL9000> my knowledge of the analog-domain bits of that is... minimal
[14:56:59] <humasect> king gizz in my head+ears\
[14:57:16] <SAL9000> might need exponential + random/offset, actually -- too prone to lockstep
[14:57:38] <SAL9000> ofc if you can have a master device driving everything things get easier
[14:57:52] <hayley> And I assume all the peers are on the same PCB or something like that.
[14:58:13] <SAL9000> why not something like i2c, though?

[15:00:55] <hayley> I2C is also master-slave, no?
[15:01:05] <hayley> Though really I haven't ruled that out.
[15:01:55] <SAL9000> hayley: yeah i2c is master-slave. multi-slave is more-or-less normal, multi-master is rarely supported according to wikipedia
[15:02:00] <hayley> Hm, Wikipedia mentions handling collisions between multiple masters.
[15:02:49] <SAL9000> Dunno if you can do master-master communication, though.
[15:03:03] <hayley> The other thing, yes.
[15:09:26] <hayley> There are very mixed answers on whether or not the Arduino implementation can handle collisions.
[15:11:33] <hayley> Building a toy machine cluster from microcontrollers should be fun, but you have to do this dumb engineering work, and as I said yesterday it is easier to use a damn GPU.

[17:00:20] <gilberth> Good morning #lispcafe!
[17:01:48] <gilberth> hayley: For using UARTs you may look at RS-485, although that is a physical layer, you don't need. Or your MCU might come with CAN.
[17:02:13] <hayley> gilberth: I see.
[17:03:25] <gilberth> I2C in theory is multi-master, but limited in address space. And I have never seen it operated that way.
[17:03:58] <hayley> https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/bt After LDB in one instruction (again), I present SBIT in one instruction
[17:03:58] -ixelp- BT — Bit Test
[17:04:25] <gilberth> Otherwise, an UART driving OC a bus, would do. Just do collision detection.
[17:08:28] <gilberth> But yes, depends on how far your MCUs are away from each other. I assume they share a common ground. Otherwise: Differential, hence RS485. Very robust.

[17:09:57] -ixelp- Andy Summers / Robert Fripp - I Advance Masked - YouTube
[17:13:36] <hayley> Still pointless to cluster at this size though. For some number of piss weak processors I could probably find one that is faster than all of them and avoid the engineering effort. Then I could find multiple of those, but then I could just use a faster processor again. Repeat until you run out of money anyway.
[17:15:49] <gilberth> Sure. Same thing as it is pointless of having a Lisp-CPU on some FPGA.
[17:18:41] <hayley> One can derive some result from that though. e.g. someone made a garbage collection accelerator for an itty bitty RISC-V machine.
[17:19:15] <hayley> https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~krste/papers/GC-MicroTopPicks2019.pdf At least you can compare FPGA CPU without a feature to FPGA CPU with a feature, no?
[17:20:44] * hayley notes that some Microsoft Office thing was used for diagrams by the font.
[17:33:15] <hayley> https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2345156.2254068 Or see this hardware GC which never stalls the mutator.
[17:33:18] -ixelp- And then there were none: a stall-free real-time garbage collector for reconfigurable hardware: ACM SIGPLAN Notices: Vol [...]
[17:33:18] * gilberth bets the PDF was not TeXed. Look at the paragraphs, how uneven space is distributed.
[17:35:28] <gilberth> hayley: Sure, would all be fun to play with. I always dreamt on some GC controller, or some intelligent memory, with a CONS primitive the main CPU would invoke. Though I need to get awake and 'll read your pointers later. That abstract memory could also pointer swizzle for you.
[17:36:25] <hayley> Though the latter relies on dual-port RAM (but we have caches to handle; does a stall for GC really matter more than a stall for another core to give you a cache line?) and the same layout for every object.
