[04:31:30] <SleePy> So I no longer am a sysadmin (now a software dev), but was in the office today and things started to break randomly.  So I step up to help the new sysadmin.  Was a fun challenge of DNS resolution working, but pings/connections not.  It challenged my knowledge.  I couldn't even get host file edits working.

[04:32:25] <xe0n> host file edits, gross.
[04:32:40] <SleePy> Told the new sysadmin, it feels like a dns issue and a certificate issue..  But dns servers are fine and resolving and dns sec doesn't apply to our internal domain...  It was both.  Our Direct Access Server certs expired..  So dns stopped working on clients that had it deployed to them in the office..  
[04:33:50] <SleePy> Luckily the public facing side of DA uses a public cert.  So all remote workers where fine.  Just all those in the office, we had to fix up manually by ejecting the DA registry keys, forcing a gp update and then rebooting to reinstall da
[04:35:10] <SleePy> Yea, didn't like the hostfile edit... But when you can do 'nslookup domain.local' and it works, but you do 'ping domain.local' and it fails with a lookup error.. Your confused.  Try it with a host file edit for 'foobar.domain.local' and you can't ping it, you know something about the client dns service is broken
[04:35:48] <SleePy> I even had wireshark going.. nslookup to google.com, I see the traffic.  nslookup to domain.local, no traffic..  
[04:38:36] <SleePy> Felt good to deal with some IT issues again.  Rather than software issues for once.  Had to quickly (in 10 mins) fix a software bug in one of our apps, because the boss needed it working to present with the CEO tomorrow morning.  Got lucky I guessed what was broken and fixed it

[05:24:55] <PattyCakes> mine runs on a pi

[05:25:11] <JollyRgrs> it isn't really HW intensive
[05:25:16] <JollyRgrs> at least if you're just using file storage
[05:25:30] <JollyRgrs> but it offers a lot (document sharing/calendar/etc)
[05:25:32] <SleePy> Runs in a VM on my server.  4 vCPUs and 4 gb of ram.  Its attached via NFS to the zfs pool for data storage, so it has quite a bit of "room"
[05:25:35] <JollyRgrs> so... depends on what you do
[05:25:39] <JollyRgrs> SleePy is same as me
[05:25:52] <PattyCakes> if I hit mine with a bunch of file transfers over fuse at once, it kills the pi

[05:45:18] <unorgaaccount> fr i never used it 
[05:45:41] <SleePy> Putty... That's old.  WSL and use ssh.
[05:46:04] <mistiry> dont even need WSL
[05:46:08] <xe0n> LOL "i need to use putty" "nah install WSL and then fuck around with that"
[05:46:09] <xe0n> whaaaat
[05:46:26] <unorgaaccount> bet
[05:46:31] <SleePy> I know powershell has native ssh as well, never liked it.  WSL because I like to have my ssh connections in .sh files so I can quickly tab reference them when firing up the connection
[05:46:51] <mistiry> "have my ssh connections in .sh files" wut
[05:46:55] <xe0n> i use rdm :P
[05:47:01] <SleePy> WSL needs fuckery?  Was fairly easy to install for me
[05:47:28] <estranger> telnet for life
[05:47:36] <SleePy> mistiry: I'm lazy and some of my ssh connections require custom ports or jump hosts.  It made it easier to just type "./daserver" then all the params I need to do that
[05:47:43] <Molnija> V to victory, you found a place to paste it down
[05:47:50] <estranger> I telnet to 22 and manually handle the encryption
[05:47:51] <mistiry> .ssh/config?
[05:48:02] <mistiry> why use bash scripts lol
[05:48:12] <mistiry> use the ssh config file to define the ports and such for your hosts
[05:48:17] <SleePy> Yea, I do that on my mbp, but still use the files on windows.  
[05:48:22] <Molnija> for when you need a jump host mistiry
[05:49:13] <mistiry> the ~/.ssh/config file can be used on Windows too
[05:49:28] <estranger> can't tab complete config entries
[05:49:29] <SleePy> You can define jump hosts in the .ssh/config, I know that.  I really should stop.  But you know, I haven't liked the idea of the .ssh folder syncing between devices... So at least a folder with ssh files is easier to trust. 
[05:50:18] <mistiry> so a folder with custom shell scripts that will only work on bash
[05:50:18] <SleePy> I've got a mbp, mint desktop and windows desktop... I have to sync stuff.
[05:50:25] <mistiry> vs. a native and cross platform solution
[05:50:33] <mistiry> you have to copy shell scripts around too though right?
[05:50:38] <SleePy> mistiry: Yes, but with WSL I can access my Users folder on windows.
[05:50:38] <mistiry> whats the difference?
[05:51:12] <estranger> thousand ways to skin a cat
[05:51:25] <SleePy> yup.  My solution works for me.

[05:52:05] <unorgaaccount> lol
[05:52:12] <unorgaaccount> what card does it have xeon
[05:52:19] <xe0n> one that's on the motherboard?
[05:52:26] <SleePy> I'm a bit crazy about keys as well.  I reference ssh keys in the .ssh folder, which doesn't sync.  I use a ssh key uniquely for each service.  So lots of work to setup a new desktop, but I feel better about security of my connections
[05:52:39] <unorgaaccount> oh sorry i thought there was a pre installed pcie card
[05:52:44] <xe0n> nah
[05:52:57] <xe0n> the other one is pcie, umm asus something something, phat antenna thing
[05:52:57] <mistiry> i mean, you should be using keys. i dont see how having one-off custom bash scripts to make ssh connections is any more secure or trustworthy lol
[05:53:04] <unorgaaccount> why dont u make a usb key with all the pre config shit 
[05:53:05] <estranger> mobos have integrated wifi now? what is this the future

[05:53:23] * mistiry tabs back out of irc
[05:53:54] <SleePy> Well it works for me.  Although I rarely use ssh on windows anyways.  I got used to iterm.app and the setup I have on it.  I find other programs just don't flow right for me
[05:54:19] <unorgaaccount> hey man idc that much about security there's a small cpu that monitors everything that i do

[07:36:54] <Hunterkll> hell no lol
[07:37:09] <Hunterkll> but 11's a free upgrade from 10 at any rate (not time limited like 10 was - at least to legitimately upgrade)
[07:38:45] <Hunterkll> which almost makes me think there may notb e a standalone sku....
[07:38:57] <sd> 12<c​ooleb09> this is for installing on a macos wiht parrallels - we originaly were hoping to go windows E3 with VDA use rights, however our CSP ahs confirmed w aren't allowed to do that anymore
[07:39:06] <Hunterkll> you never were
[07:39:24] <Hunterkll> if they told you that you could with volume licensing or whatever before, they were wrong
[07:39:24] <Hunterkll> lol
[07:39:52] <Hunterkll> VL etc for client OSes has awlways been *upgrade only* .... so you still need a base license to start with anyway
[07:40:12] <sd> 12<c​ooleb09> yeah, apaprently you are only licensed to run VMs on your machine under E3 *if* that machine is licesnsed for windwos
[07:40:19] <Hunterkll> yes
[07:40:24] <sd> 12<c​ooleb09> otherwise VDA only covers your right to access windows vm on *another* machine
[07:40:25] <Hunterkll> because just like VL, the subscription is upgrade only
[07:40:37] <Hunterkll> you can't use it to license a machine you built yourself, for example
[07:40:38] <sd> 12<c​ooleb09> so if it ws a thinclient, VDA would be fine

[07:41:38] <sd> 12<c​ooleb09> but I don't think a Vm is an allowed use for an OEM lciense, so we'd need FPP
[07:41:48] <Hunterkll> nor is a machine you built yourself but aren't reselling

[08:43:05] <Hunterkll> No....?
[08:43:11] <epony> yeah
[08:43:12] <Hunterkll> I'm surrounded by CISC and RISC machines
[08:43:23] <epony> you're surrounded by ARM marketing leaflets
[08:43:25] <Hunterkll> just because i'm using one example doesn't mean fuck all in the grand scheme of things except it's an easy, relevant modern example
[08:43:44] <epony> "relevant" hahaha
[08:44:00] <Hunterkll> Hitman at ultra graphics settings, for example, on an M1 Pro macbook pro, gets the same FPS as it does on a Razer Blade 15 Advanced with an i7 and RTX 3070 
[08:44:03] <epony> it's like 5% of the laptop market, dude
[08:44:08] <epony> go check your data
[08:44:14] <Hunterkll> epony: it's a relevant example of general purpose computing ARM chips 
[08:44:19] <epony> relevant...
[08:44:21] <epony> hahaha
[08:44:25] <Hunterkll> you're saying ARM can't do it
[08:44:29] <Hunterkll> yet there's hard evidence it can
[08:44:30] <epony> it can't
[08:44:34] <epony> lower efficiency
[08:44:39] <epony> more expensive
[08:44:50] <epony> worse thermal performance
[08:44:51] <Hunterkll> yet it's achieving the same performance for similar/lower cost at lower power usage 
[08:44:55] <Hunterkll> with lower TDP 
[08:44:57] <epony> that's BS dude
[08:45:02] <Hunterkll> that's factual data
[08:45:09] <epony> your Apple craptop costs more and does less

[08:45:29] <Hunterkll> i'm sure the ARM blades we have in our datacenter also cost more and do less
[08:45:30] <Hunterkll> oh wait
[08:45:33] <Hunterkll> they do about the same and cost less
[08:45:48] <epony> it's a pointless debate

[08:46:38] <Hunterkll> what ever shall we do
[08:46:50] <Hunterkll> I mean, there's no debate. You're just spouting FUD, talking points, and personal beliefs with no grounding in reality

[08:47:20] <Hunterkll> lol
[08:47:33] <epony> how can it save you anything if it's more expensive and does less?
[08:47:37] <Hunterkll> my newest personally owned mac is a macbook core 2 duo i got for free

[08:48:02] <Hunterkll> and reduces support costs
[08:48:12] <Hunterkll> the same way W10 caused half our helpdesk to be laid off due to drop in support volume needed

[08:48:50] <epony> let me tell you this: ARM is trailing x86 by 10-20 years
[08:48:57] <Hunterkll> except, it's not
[08:49:00] <epony> it is
[08:49:09] <Hunterkll> please, provide some actual evidence
[08:49:20] <epony> the x86 laptops appeared as a demonstration that RISC laptops can not sell
[08:49:23] <Hunterkll> instead of hyperbole and blatantly biased personal beliefs 
[08:49:33] <epony> also the RISC workstation can not sell
[08:49:43] <epony> and then the RISC servers can not sell
[08:49:52] <epony> finally the RISC supercomputers can not sell
[08:49:56] <SirSceptalotter> hunter you sound like my mom after she told someone i'm smart
[08:50:04] <epony> and you end up shouting here "ARM" is so "fantastic"
[08:50:08] <epony> well, keep it ;-)
[08:50:15] <Hunterkll> yet, they are selling
[08:50:20] <Hunterkll> so i don't understand what you're saying?
[08:50:29] <Hunterkll> marketshare of all is steadily increasing
[08:50:41] <epony> I'm saying, you're advertising the trailer park office supplies
[08:51:07] <epony> good luck with the increase then
[08:51:13] <epony> it missed only 40 years so far
[08:51:43] <Hunterkll> nah, had a different niche because of a lot of drama, splits, and market segmentation between vendors that lost out in the PC wars
[08:51:51] <Hunterkll> and they didn't lose out because they had an inferior product
[08:52:10] <Hunterkll> but Q3 2021 ARM market share of PCs (not phones/tablets) was 8% 
[08:52:25] <Hunterkll> up from 2% a year ago, which was up f rom almost 0% not even 5-10 years ago 
[08:52:48] <mistiry> 6502 > *
[08:52:49] <epony> Apple laptops are consistent 5-8% for the last 10 years
[08:53:00] <Hunterkll> only ~6% is a pple 
[08:53:08] <Hunterkll> so that's another 3% that's non-apple
[08:53:24] <epony> your definition of growth is "not growing" any
[08:53:38] <Hunterkll> but at any rate, ARM-based server revenues grew 430% year over year in Q3 2020 
[08:53:42] <epony> the marketing is growing only ;-) and the prices and the total operational costs
[08:53:48] <epony> so it's worse performance
[08:54:03] *** Quits: ominionx (~ominionx@172.58.136.5) (Remote host closed the connection)
[08:54:11] <epony> more money lost by consumers of the technology, lower performance and inferior computers
[08:54:15] <Hunterkll> again, that's a subjective statement, while objective testing can demonstrate - objectively - by raw numbers - that it's not worse prformance 
[08:54:20] <epony> you're unable to read numbers ;-)
[08:54:27] <epony> what is subjective?
[08:54:27] <Hunterkll> i'm still waiting for you to provide some data to back up your claims
[08:54:41] <Hunterkll> you're calling ARM inferior based on what you think you know and your exposure to it
[08:54:44] <Hunterkll> not to any reality 
[08:54:48] <epony> well, check out how much money is Apple sucking from its victims?
[08:55:04] <epony> it's an ARM shop
[08:55:13] <Hunterkll> less than other vendors at this point..... which is hilarious
[08:55:27] <Hunterkll> then again, even when apple was x86, they were still price competitive spec for spec, if not cheaper, than our Dell and HP configs 
[08:55:38] <epony> cause it can't compete with Intel and AMD, has nothing in terms of technology, just trailing reimplementations of inferior CPUs and higher costs of everything
[08:55:40] <Hunterkll> but that also goes into build quality, warranty/support contracts, etc 
[08:55:54] <Hunterkll> again, please provide data to back up those claims :P
[08:56:00] <epony> Apple is consumer appliances
[08:56:17] <epony> the work computers are still X86 in the form factors you get "work" done
[08:56:31] *** Quits: jesse (~jesse@user/jesse) (Quit: jesse)
[08:56:46] <epony> for communications and infotainment and embedded use, ARM is useful
[08:56:58] <Hunterkll> Considering most of the companies I have worked for, engage with, and worked with alongside on contracts, only issue laptops unless there's an exceptional need, that's definitely not universally true
[08:57:02] *** Joins: jesse (~jesse@user/jesse)
[08:57:11] <epony> it just can't scale to efficient and reliable computation in the larger computers

[08:57:35] <Hunterkll> epony: yet, I can provide tons of examples that it does..... you can't provide any counter-examples other than handwavy bullshit
[08:57:51] <epony> you can prove nothing, since you're in the leasing computers and post-market sectors
[08:58:00] <Hunterkll> we don't lease
[08:58:32] <epony> ok, it's not the point of argument though
[08:58:53] <epony> the ARM is so "fantastic" is just praising consumer appliances
[08:58:59] <Hunterkll> yes, the point is, you can't provide any references or data backing up your claims that arm is inherently more inefficient than x86 or costlier 
[08:59:12] <Hunterkll> epony: yea, let's ignore the supercomputer growing market share, the server growing market share, etc 
[08:59:27] *** Quits: PwnHoaX (~PwnHoaX@user/pwnhoax) (Quit: Leaving)
[08:59:29] <epony> they extract more profit and are less efficient, and work on smaller power ratings, intentionally, that's their design goals
[08:59:30] <Hunterkll> let's ignore the repeatable benchmarks and testing scenarios
[08:59:32] <Hunterkll> let's ignore all of that
[08:59:34] <Hunterkll> again
[08:59:36] <Hunterkll> "less efficient"
[08:59:43] <epony> that's why it is a different isntruction and processor organisation
[08:59:53] <Hunterkll> if they achive identical performance at lower power ratings, that's indicitive of higher efficiency
[08:59:54] <Hunterkll> not lower
[08:59:54] <epony> and it's not performing well on high load
[09:00:03] <Hunterkll> again, that's provably false
[09:00:08] <epony> it isn't
[09:00:49] <epony> since the 95-99% x86 dominant platform metric on business computers shows the substantial difference in performance and power efficiency
[09:00:53] <Hunterkll> I mean, just from a market share perspective... https://www.datacenterknowledge.com/hardware/omdia-arm-based-server-cpus-experience-record-demand
[09:01:03] <Hunterkll> No, market share does *not* show that
[09:01:12] <epony> it kind of does
[09:01:18] <Molnija> I want an ARM workstation with ECC
[09:01:20] <Hunterkll> market share shows what the market has wanted/accepted/required due to compatiblity/legacy/developer skills/etc
[09:01:25] <Molnija> Until then, I'm gonna use my x86 server
[09:01:30] <Molnija> which has ECC
[09:01:35] <Hunterkll> there's a fuckload more factors that go into marketshare than just "it's better than the alternative"
[09:01:43] <Hunterkll> otherwise we wou ldn't have needed antitrust laws...
[09:01:47] <Molnija> there's inertia, compatibility issues
[09:02:12] <epony> there are.. also business decisions, it's not wishful thinking and affection and affiliate marketing
[09:02:32] <Hunterkll> uhuh
[09:02:35] <Molnija> in a way, RISC is dead. in another way, RISC is winning the world
[09:02:58] <Hunterkll> just like how Alpha, POWER and SPARC were/are objectively superior performance wise - sometimes in multiples - to x86, yet x86 still won 
[09:03:01] <epony> it's good to have competing architectures
[09:03:09] <Hunterkll>  https://www.infoq.com/articles/arm-vs-x86-cloud-performance/
[09:03:23] <Hunterkll> here's a nice writeup on server performance
[09:03:26] <epony> but it lost the 1990-2020 market on servers and business computers
[09:03:43] <Molnija> RISC is dead because modern RISC architectures have comparable instruction counts to modern CISC
[09:03:50] <epony> exactly
[09:04:03] <epony> and lower efficiency on price and mass production
[09:04:03] <Hunterkll> and modern CISC cpus are just decoders with a RISC backend
[09:04:07] <Hunterkll> and the added inefficiency that incurs 
[09:04:15] <Molnija> yeah...
[09:04:18] <epony> it does not matter what's inside the CPU
[09:04:27] <Hunterkll>  but that's literally what we're talking about
[09:04:28] <epony> it's what you use to program it
[09:04:33] <epony> no it's not
[09:04:38] <epony> you're talking ARM
[09:04:48] <Hunterkll> ARM, SPARC, Alpha, z/Arch, POWER, you name it
[09:04:51] <Hunterkll> i'm talking about all of them
[09:04:54] <epony> while I'm telling you ARM sucks on larger processors, not to be found
[09:05:00] <Hunterkll> POWER smokes x86_64 but there's just not the software library to support it
[09:05:11] <epony> yeah, it is not very popular
[09:05:12] <Molnija> megahertz myth
[09:05:13] <Hunterkll> and it's price competitive to high end intel servers that it beats down in performance
[09:05:34] <epony> millions of instructions per second in the same power envelope and mass production rates
[09:05:36] <Molnija> S390X is allegedly CISC
[09:05:38] <Hunterkll> with ARM, the software library is getting there, hence the growth in market share 
[09:05:49] <Hunterkll> Molnija: that's the predecessor to z/Arch

[09:09:26] <epony> yeah, in the 1-2% range
[09:09:31] <epony> it's "FANTASTIC"
[09:09:42] <Hunterkll> because x86 took over from 6502 overnight
[09:09:53] <epony> shit happens
[09:09:54] <Hunterkll> or m68k in the workstation space

[09:10:03] <Hunterkll> right
[09:10:07] <Molnija> god

[09:10:44] <Hunterkll> also I just got what your nick is supposed to mean LOL

[09:11:07] <epony> stricken by lightning
[09:11:26] <Hunterkll> epony: point being, really, just because ARM was used extensively in one market segment, doesn't mean it's not suited well in others
[09:11:36] <Hunterkll> (and that list you posted of timeline is woefully incomplete)
[09:11:44] <epony> I like the fact that it powers some embedded chips though..
[09:12:03] <Hunterkll> so does x86
[09:12:05] <Hunterkll> so does MIPS
[09:12:13] <epony> but I don't like the fact that I have no access to program these "chip"-computers openly
[09:12:13] <Hunterkll> they can all be utilized however you design and see fit
[09:12:17] <Hunterkll> since they're general purpose CPUs 
[09:12:55] <Hunterkll> epony: but yea, it's like, that list really is nothing but some low level arm fluff and x86 past 2008 
[09:13:04] <Hunterkll> completely ignores things like POWER9, z/arch, etc
[09:13:05] <epony> yeah I don't see the huge difference as "capability" and but as "efficiency" and "scale" of production and deployment
[09:13:12] <Hunterkll> Natsemi's the only thing on there until we get back to 2005 
[09:13:17] <epony> one has benefits in specialised the other in general computing
[09:13:41] <Hunterkll> epony: so the fact that shipping, performance competitive/equivelent, lower power usage, cheaper ARM server CPUs exist today doesn't matter to you?
[09:13:44] <epony> it's quite possible, in the future they will level up
[09:13:55] <Hunterkll> ARM started out as, and has always remaned, a general purpose CPU 
[09:13:57] <Hunterkll> no specialization 
[09:14:07] <Hunterkll> some of hte design may have lent itself to power efficiency, but that wasn't the design goal
[09:14:10] <Hunterkll> just a side effect
[09:14:16] <epony> it was specialised in the low power home computer markets
[09:14:16] <Molnija> if I had a long credit line or $10,000 I could get an ARM workstation tomorrow
[09:14:25] <Hunterkll> lol
[09:14:31] <Molnija> x86 has competition, if the software library exists in your niche
[09:14:40] <epony> yeah, arm goes back to the 90ies with 80ies designs
[09:15:07] <epony> x86 goes back to teh 80ies with 70ies design
[09:15:13] <Molnija> as a mere unix enthusiast, the software library exists in my niche
[09:15:19] <epony> I think that trend has remained with 10 year disparity
[09:15:37] <Hunterkll> epony: i mean, that equivelency would make x86 seem worse off
[09:15:57] <Molnija> I dream of one day having server firepower in my front room on ARMv8+ as well as x86
[09:15:57] <epony> well, let's face it, X86 is successful

[09:16:18] <Hunterkll> no one's disputing that
[09:16:25] <epony> let's wish the same success to SPARC and RISCV
[09:16:40] <Molnija> SPARC is fail because it's not really licenced out. RISC5 is just starting up
[09:16:43] <Hunterkll> x86 pushed out SPARC already to niche applications, even while it had far superior performance 
[09:16:56] <Hunterkll> there's a lot of historical reasons why x86 won, and almost none of it because it was a superior design
[09:16:59] <Molnija> I can't get a SPARC workstation nowadays
[09:17:04] <epony> well, x86 can't scale down
[09:17:05] <Hunterkll> yea you can 
[09:17:05] <Molnija> wish I could.
[09:17:12] <Hunterkll> epony: the hell it can't 
[09:17:16] <epony> it has higher power usage and needs to be fed computation
[09:17:17] <Molnija> and I mean a late model
[09:17:23] <Hunterkll> epony: yea, it's more inefficient 
[09:17:35] <epony> so idling is not X86's priority
[09:17:55] <epony> it was built to rapidly compute, RISC too, but it can scale down better
[09:17:57] <Hunterkll> epony: you mean wasn't before the pentium 
[09:18:03] <Hunterkll> :P
[09:18:07] <Molnija> pentium which?
[09:18:11] <Hunterkll> any pentiuim
[09:18:15] <epony> yeah, low power models exist on x86 since the days of 8088
[09:18:18] <Molnija> original 586?
[09:18:21] <epony> then 80186
[09:18:27] <epony> and later Atoms
[09:18:29] <Hunterkll> 80186 was just a clocked up 8086 iirc 
[09:18:42] <Hunterkll> 80286 was the first actual architecture/instruction change
[09:18:44] <Molnija> and yet I can idle my x86 computer down to a couple tens of watts
[09:18:46] <epony> x86 has its lower power rating models too
[09:18:59] <Hunterkll> Molnija: you should look into POWER workstations
[09:19:01] <Hunterkll> like the Raptor boards
[09:19:02] <Molnija> BUT, it's not as good as the comparable ARMv8 computer would be
[09:19:03] <epony> it just can't go down to the small power ratings that ARM CPUs did

[09:21:28] <epony> people want "silence" ;-)
[09:21:31] <Molnija> this, feels like a flame war

[09:21:38] <Hunterkll> Molnija: how?
[09:21:50] <Hunterkll> I mean, i'm still waiting for epony to back up his statements, but he occasionally does bring up a point or two

[09:22:05] <epony> nah, we're debating enthusiastically, because we like arguments in the level of comparative analysis
[09:22:08] <Hunterkll> but using market share as a primary defense to "arm can't do what x86_64 can!" just isn't kosher without backing it up 
[09:22:16] <Hunterkll> which he has yet to do :D
[09:22:32] <epony> well
[09:22:39] <Hunterkll> Molnija: also, FYI, the SPARC ISA is licenseable, open even
[09:22:54] <Molnija> oh, I had forgotten
[09:22:57] <Hunterkll> https://sparc.org/
[09:23:16] <Molnija> Hunterkll: I, personally, will not take your advice (except coincidentally) in re: use of /ignore, especially because you think it makes me someone of low intelligence. I believe rational intelligent people can disagree on the use of blocking mechanisms.
[09:23:18] <Hunterkll> feel free to design your own
[09:23:23] <epony> you mentioned supercomputers..

[09:23:30] <Hunterkll> Molnija: oh, i never said you were of low intelligence
[09:23:43] <Molnija> you said "retarded" which is synonymous
[09:23:52] <Hunterkll> actions don't always equate intelligence
[09:23:53] <Hunterkll> epony: huh, weird, that, how the ARM market share is growing again and the #1 
[09:23:54] <Molnija> and a slur at the expense of people with intellectual difficulties, to boot
[09:24:04] <epony> maybe we can extend that to "number of processors" as sockets and cores
[09:24:27] <Hunterkll> we'd also have to correlate for frequency etc
[09:24:58] <Hunterkll> epony: also, have to correlate for GPU vs non-GPU equipped
[09:25:03] <epony> that's why we go to the performance (instructions) and production scaleout (numbers)
[09:25:19] <epony> oh yeah, GPUs are definitely not-x86 ;-)
[09:25:21] <Hunterkll> production scaleout means jack all, all we care about is price and performance of shipping parts 
[09:25:35] <epony> wafer productions are known
[09:25:46] <Molnija> price per performance in my niche still favors em64t
[09:25:48] <epony> that's number of CPU dies
[09:26:13] <Hunterkll> yea, i don't really care about production numbers when I can buy a chip that does the same performance for half the price today on the open market, even if that half price chip only has 10% of the production of the twice the price chip
[09:26:21] <Hunterkll> as demand goes up, production will
[09:26:27] <epony> correct
[09:26:41] <Hunterkll> but for example, the #1 supercomputer is ARM, but with zero GPU support, whereas #2 has 1/3rd the cores, but has GPU backing in each node to achive performance
[09:26:42] <epony> however I still can not buy RISC CPUs here
[09:26:48] <Hunterkll> and #1 has 2m cores less than #4 
[09:27:16] <epony> for building servers in ATX/ITX form factors
[09:27:26] <Molnija> epony: go on raptor's website, or IBM's power systems, or linaro i think? or avantek
[09:27:37] <epony> not enough money for expensive computers
[09:27:37] <Hunterkll> yea ^ RISC systems exist for building whitebox
[09:27:39] <Hunterkll> maybe not ARM yet 
[09:27:48] <Hunterkll> epony: they're price competitive for the similar performance intel parts, though 
[09:27:50] <Molnija> ibm power systems isn't whitebox
[09:28:07] <Molnija> i know some com-hpc daughterboards are being made with Ampere Altra dice
[09:28:09] <epony> need to be able to buy boards and CPUs and expansion cards
[09:28:10] <Hunterkll> Molnija: Raptor/Talos is the same as buying supermicro instead of an IBM power system
[09:28:14] <epony> that thing exists since the 90ies
[09:28:33] <epony> it was a market in the 80ies too, only closed off to the public
[09:28:42] <epony> it was open in the 90ies due to increased demand
[09:28:49] <epony> the demand has not gone down
[09:28:59] <Molnija> hm
[09:29:02] <Hunterkll> for what it's worth, you can at least buy rackable ARM servers for pretty cheap: https://www.gigabyte.com/us/Enterprise/ARM-Server
[09:29:10] <epony> portable computers were same form factor and kept shrinking
[09:29:12] <Hunterkll> with standard expansion card slots, etc
[09:29:26] <epony> but standardised modular computers are retaining their industry approved form factors
[09:29:31] <Hunterkll> even Lenovo sells ARM servers
[09:29:46] <epony> one day it would be possible to get RISC components too
[09:30:01] <epony> to build modular computers in the hobby and professional markets too
[09:30:01] *** Quits: riff-IRC (~riff-IRC@user/riff-irc) (Remote host closed the connection)
[09:30:05] <Hunterkll> it, in fact, used to be possible
[09:30:08] <Hunterkll> and is possible today, even
[09:30:11] <Hunterkll> in the sub-$1k range
[09:30:11] <epony> but for now that is as closed as it was in the 80ies for x86
[09:30:12] <Hunterkll> at least for POWER
[09:30:31] <epony> that was the sole business model of SPARC vendors
[09:30:37] <Hunterkll> here's a bog standard motherboard for ARM workstations - https://www.solid-run.com/arm-servers-networking-platforms/honeycomb-workstation/

[09:30:46] <epony> closed off components and modular computers builds
[09:30:46] <Hunterkll> but still
[09:31:00] <epony> so the punishment is very hard for this kind of "closed architecture"

[09:32:18] <Molnija> oh hella
[09:32:20] <sd> 03<H​urdyGurdyBurdy> hmmm
[09:32:33] <epony> what we need as general implementers is modular computers accessible as open architecture, for commodity computing, and industrial computing
[09:32:54] <Molnija> ordinary people do not actually care about that. i am not ordinary
[09:32:55] <epony> if the modules use RISC CPUs we do not care much, right..
[09:33:05] <epony> we just need software to program them and get work done
[09:33:11] <Hunterkll> sure, i don't thi nk anyone will disagree with that 
[09:33:18] <Hunterkll> epony: and in this case, is where transmeta would have really shone
[09:33:25] <Hunterkll> because then you don't even need to change out the damn CPU.... ;)
[09:33:43] <epony> but we can't scale to business level if the businesses sell "all-in-one" assemblies at premium costs and prohibits opening the architecture
[09:33:54] <epony> I think there is a potential
[09:34:13] <Molnija> that com-hpc board doesn't speak to whether it supports ECC
[09:34:14] <epony> for a more competitive modular componentry in the applied general computing in the field
[09:34:18] <Hunterkll> well, see - at least on the server side, ARM's available in what businesses already are comfortable with and buying today in terms of design 
[09:34:25] <Molnija> which is important to me
[09:34:28] <Hunterkll> and in terms of a lot of large companies, laptops are all that matter 
[09:34:58] <Molnija> laptops are basically sbcs
[09:35:05] <epony> with RISC computers too, but their elite position in the highly priced segments made them significantly less popular and accessible due to their closed architecture
[09:35:16] <epony> and that's the real problem with mobile and handheld computing too
[09:35:23] <epony> it's just not an open archietcture
[09:35:57] <Hunterkll> epony: the most popular RISC architectures have almost always been open for implementation by others without licensing fees, or at minimum FRAND terms
[09:36:02] <epony> as those are the "modules" below which you can't go, so you can't take and mix and match these, you get a monobloc of small appliance which is utility device, but not a computing industry building block ;-)
[09:36:18] <epony> so technically
[09:36:27] <epony> we ALL WANT RISC TO SUCCEED TOO
[09:36:34] <Molnija> breakthrough
[09:36:37] <Hunterkll> it has succeded - in the performance market
[09:36:42] <Hunterkll> now it needs to suceed in the market market
[09:36:47] <epony> just the "closed architecture" systems are.. DAMAGING to business computing in general
[09:36:53] <Hunterkll> and the time is finally ri pening, and ARM seems to be the contendor 
[09:37:05] <Hunterkll> which might actually be a threat to POWER, which is currently the Xeon's most credible threat
[09:37:12] <epony> it seems but is getting slammed for the licensing model
[09:37:40] <Hunterkll> epony: again, with the exclusion of ARM, most RISC architectures are actually open (mind you, the silicon design isn't, but that's a small thing.... if you're big enough to be launching your own chi ps)
[09:37:52] <Hunterkll> ARM's licensing model doesn't seem to be hurting it's rocketing growth now
[09:37:59] <Hunterkll> rocketing growth in non-embedded segments, that is
[09:38:14] <epony> ARM is closed on CPU design property, so is x86..
[09:38:20] <epony> they all are
[09:38:28] <Hunterkll> SPARC and POWER are open standards
[09:38:29] <epony> except some new designs
[09:38:41] <epony> as open as nobody wants them ;-)
[09:38:57] <Hunterkll> Fujitsu supercomputers sure do ;)
[09:39:01] <epony> because of implementers fee and contracts etc
[09:39:11] <epony> Intel and Amd did not pick that up
[09:39:19] <epony> neither the rest of the producers
[09:39:34] <Hunterkll> Intel hilariously sold off thei rARM division around.... 2005 i think, to marvell 
[09:39:40] <epony> so Japan's industry is tightly locked by USA
[09:39:40] <Hunterkll> after they won it off DEC in a lawsuit 
[09:40:17] <epony> the end result is, for now x86 is "open architecture" as building blocks and that's the consumer PC market
[09:40:39] <Hunterkll> except for the required proprietary bits to bootstrap it which you don't find on other architectures 
[09:41:02] <Hunterkll> even an RPi i can bootstrap with my own code without losing any functionality (save shit like Mali GPUs and the like)
[09:41:28] <epony> so compare ARM with the Intel and AMD design companies offshore in the middle east
[09:41:41] <epony> ARM itself does not produce much, some implementors do
[09:41:53] <epony> so the real competition of Intel and AMD are those implementers
[09:41:55] <Hunterkll> ARM produces reference silicon designs as well as the ISA 
[09:42:07] <Hunterkll> most implementations are using ARM IP blocks in their design 
[09:42:08] <Molnija> CAD11,000 for a basic Gigabyte R152-P30
[09:42:12] <epony> like marvell broadcom qualcomm mediatek etc
[09:42:15] <epony> and nvidia
[09:42:16] <Hunterkll> yep
[09:42:20] <Hunterkll> they're extensively using ARM IP blocks
[09:42:25] <Hunterkll> not just the ISA
[09:42:55] <Molnija> from this 'thinkmate' outfit
[09:43:08] <epony> yes, that does not make ARM that much different than X86, it just is a result of the later development of the foundry business model of semiconductor production
[09:43:39] <epony> you'll see in the 80ies and 90ies it was even less accessible so AMD was an implementer of x86 designs on re-lease from Intel
[09:43:48] <epony> instead of from design companies
[09:44:01] <Hunterkll> AMD didn't get the license from intel willy nilly
[09:44:05] <Hunterkll> it was under duress on intel's part
[09:44:16] <epony> so the 70ies and 80ies were fully vertically monolithic and non-spread, totally integrated and in-house
[09:44:23] <epony> INCLUDING production facilities
[09:44:34] <Hunterkll> DoD wouldn't procure intel parts unless they complied with the dual sourcing rule, so intel essentially had to license x86 to AMD for production..... or DoD wouldn't buy intel CPUs
[09:44:43] <Hunterkll> that's the whole reason AMD has the x86 license to begin with 
[09:45:04] <epony> it is important to create compatible processors
[09:45:14] <Hunterkll> not compatible, they were producing 1:1 copies 
[09:45:17] <epony> that's why the ISA exist in the first place
[09:45:39] <Hunterkll> At the time, if the DoD couldn't buy the same part from two different vendors, they didn't buy the part except in extremely limited cases
[09:45:56] <epony> then it's implementers choice of instruction sub-sets and families and then up to the design studios and the foundries to procude the orders of implementers
[09:45:56] *** Joins: structoha (~structoha@gateway/tor-sasl/structoha)
[09:46:00] <Hunterkll> that's literally the only reason AMD got the x86 license
[09:46:13] <epony> that's not just DoD, it's the market demands for global sales
[09:46:27] <epony> Intel can not fulfill all orders
[09:46:29] <Hunterkll> no - in this specific scenario 
[09:46:34] <Hunterkll> that was exactly how it went down
[09:46:40] <epony> it simply can not churn that much CPUs the demand was very very high
[09:46:54] <Hunterkll> Intel was able to meet demand and then some back then 
[09:46:55] <epony> and competition was fierce
[09:46:55] <Molnija> $23k for a 2s server https://store.avantek.co.uk/ampere-altra-mt-jade.html
[09:46:58] <Molnija> i think
[09:47:02] <epony> with MANY other companies
[09:47:10] <Hunterkll> sure, of other architectures
[09:47:12] <epony> which were semiconductor industry leaders
[09:47:18] <Hunterkll> AMD would not have gotten the license if it wasn't for the DoD rules
[09:47:19] <Hunterkll> full stop
[09:47:21] <epony> just not CPU design studio services users
[09:47:49] <Hunterkll> well, indirectly since IBM enforced it on intel, and DoD was enforcing on IBM 
[09:48:00] <epony> so the entire market separation of production capacity, created this requirement to have different stages procured by different companies
[09:48:08] <Hunterkll> the ammended contract in 1984 was a direct result of that requirement
[09:48:37] <Hunterkll> yea, no, literally the dual sourcing requirement was the only reason AMD got the license
[09:48:42] <Hunterkll> intel had far more than enough production capability 
[09:49:22] *** Joins: Pseudocrat (~sudo@user/pseudocrat)
[09:49:24] <Hunterkll> in fact, intel's primary logic for playing along and agreeing, was that they still be the primary supplier all along, and that AMD was a just in case gambit and AMD could sell outside to whoever, if someone would buy it

[09:51:39] <Hunterkll> again, produciton scale/figures don't matter, end-user price does
[09:51:46] <epony> yes
[09:52:01] <epony> that's why 6502 had a brief production success
[09:52:22] <epony> it was quite cheaply implemented by a competing offshoot of the original design studio
[09:52:51] <epony> and it was superceded with 16bit designs quickly
[09:53:17] *** Quits: Pseudocrat (~sudo@user/pseudocrat) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[09:53:27] <epony> as the 8bit computers were used as a shrink and industry attempted break into small scale and affordable computing
[09:53:33] <epony> but the end prices were HIGH
[09:53:38] <epony> compared to the component costs
[09:53:54] <epony> so they raised efficiency by increasing the computational capacity of the form factor
[09:53:55] <Molnija> end user price is high for arm stuff
[09:54:08] <Molnija> but x86 in that sector isn't much lower
[09:54:25] <Hunterkll> Molnija: is it? I can buy an ARM laptop that performs better than the Atom/celeron shit for the same price. 
[09:55:11] <epony> yeah, smaller computers are more expensive as they are lower efficiency
[09:55:24] <epony> (more packaging compared to the computation)
[09:55:29] <Hunterkll> again with this "lower efficiency" bullshit 
[09:55:40] <epony> it is unfortunate
[09:55:48] <Hunterkll> if clock for clock the ARM CPU is more performant with lower power usage, then it's not lower efficiency 
[09:55:57] <epony> but a mobile phone for example has very poor thermal design as a computer
[09:56:08] <epony> so it can't keep up the computation and scales down
[09:56:31] <epony> it's the real problem, thermal design and efficiency of packaging the computation
[09:56:37] <Hunterkll> heh, well, in 2015 the 950 XL had heat pipe based cooling inside the device because it was also intended to be used in docked/laptop/desktop style scenarios 
[09:56:50] <epony> that's why dense computing has cooling buildings and racks ;-)
[09:56:51] <Hunterkll> i used the hell out of contiuum when I was actively using my 950 XL 
[09:57:12] <Hunterkll> epony: right, but ARM designs in the same formfactor of the x86 designs are outperforming them, both in battery life and raw performance
[09:57:20] <Hunterkll> so that means, t he arm designs are more efficient than the x86 ones
[09:57:22] <Hunterkll> right?
[09:57:36] <Hunterkll> in terms of being used as general purpose computing devices 
[09:57:53] <epony> much better efficiency, if you can miniaturise a data centre to the size of a laptop, you'd need a very elaborate internal design and cooling and power requirements proportionally, you con't dedicate that level of complexity and achieve the same efficiency in packaging suprplus
[09:58:09] <epony> so, the real problem is, packaging and thermal envelope
[09:58:14] <Hunterkll> okay, but wasn't the main point of this about general purpose computing and how ARM was supposedly inferior?
[09:58:27] <epony> that's why you got different form factors of processor dies and their heat dissipation
[09:58:31] <Hunterkll> if the ARM cpus can deliver more performance in the same envelope of the x86 system, that means they're more efficient

[10:01:09] <Molnija> Hunterkll: Your < Hunterkll> Molnija: is it? I can buy an ARM laptop that performs better than the Atom/celeron shit for the same price. 
[10:01:20] <Hunterkll> Molnija: most of the time, yes, I can install linux onit
[10:01:23] <Hunterkll> go figure
[10:01:25] <Molnija> cool
[10:01:30] <epony> you can, but it trails with 10-15 years
[10:01:36] <Molnija> does it have a sata port
[10:01:36] <Hunterkll> no, no it doesn't
[10:01:41] <Hunterkll> Molnija: you can linux up M1 macs too
[10:01:46] <Hunterkll> Molnija: fuck, half of most laptops today don't
[10:01:49] <epony> so a netbook for example in 2008-2010 took the market
[10:02:11] <Molnija> half of most laptops today are glorified tablets. Yes, that includes the x86 ones.
[10:02:17] <epony> while the comparable arm laptops appear 10 years later and still can't do teh same because of lack of software support
[10:02:36] <Hunterkll> but it's not because they lack performance or capability
[10:02:49] <Molnija> epony: there's a lag time to bootstrap a "new" arch
[10:02:54] <Hunterkll> in fact, Microsoft's proven you can run x86 software on 'em and that just drags the battery life back into x86 laptop territory 
[10:03:01] <Hunterkll> Apple's doing the same thing
[10:03:08] <Molnija> uh oh
[10:03:08] <Hunterkll> far better than Itanium could at any rate
[10:03:21] <epony> so, get it.. this Atom CPU is compacted 2000-2004 desktop CPU in a 1-2W thermal envelope coming down from 50-75W models
[10:03:57] <epony> and you're calling it "shit" while it dominated the consumer market sales several years on the low end of compact laptops
[10:04:14] <epony> there are also
[10:04:15] <Molnija> yes, because market dominance does not evidence superiority
[10:04:20] <Molnija> see: Windows NT
[10:04:23] <Molnija> see: Google
[10:04:24] <epony> Atom server and communications CPUs
[10:04:43] <epony> and Geode embedded and comms CPUs too
[10:05:00] *** Joins: redstarcomrade (uid99592@user/redstarcomrade)
[10:05:00] <epony> so x86 too has embedded and IPC processors
[10:05:08] *** Joins: Pseudocrat (~sudo@user/pseudocrat)
[10:05:10] <Hunterkll> Geode
[10:05:15] <Hunterkll> that's a line i haven't heard of in a long tim e
[10:05:20] <epony> ;-)
[10:05:32] <Hunterkll> that got nixed in like, the mid to late 2000s
[10:05:36] <epony> AMD kind of re-iterated on the embedded processors too
[10:06:55] <Molnija> Hunterkll: how are PC Engines still selling?
[10:07:07] <Molnija> I know soekris closed down recently
[10:07:25] <epony> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Intel_CPU_microarchitectures#x86_ULV_(Atom)
[10:07:27] <Molnija> x86 is waning. It's still a concern but it's waning
[10:07:39] <Hunterkll> I wouldn't even call it waning 
[10:07:46] <Hunterkll> i'd just say this is a market correction
[10:07:49] <epony> my compact servers are Atom CPUs
[10:08:02] <Hunterkll> I forsee it being dominant for a good 20-30+ years, at least, and intel pulling out something else to succeed it proper 
[10:08:11] <Hunterkll> Microsoft, finally, is rolling forward in a way tha t'll help with that
[10:08:25] <Hunterkll> the pseudo-deprecation of Win32, slow elimination of 32-bit, etc 
[10:08:36] <Molnija> some flight simmer probably has an avantek workstation
[10:08:42] <epony> and my full scale towers are AMD CPUs
[10:08:43] <Molnija> and uses it for flight sim
[10:09:44] <epony> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_AMD_CPU_microarchitectures
[10:09:51] <epony> check the K8 generation
[10:09:57] <Hunterkll> but yea, x86's being bucked in a way it hasn't for 20 years or so 
[10:10:04] <Molnija> my current tower is an AMD Acer, and i'm about to replace it with a dual Intel-powered Lenovo vacuum cleaner
[10:10:09] <Hunterkll> and not just the AMD v Intel stuff 
[10:10:16] <epony> that's where the 64bit computing came to the mass market
[10:10:32] <Molnija> which was a bit of a ram sap
[10:10:38] <Molnija> now we do less with more
[10:11:09] <epony> the other breakthrough peak was the 250nm process in the 1996-1998 time frame (is from 1990-1992 but takes time to reach market peak)
[10:11:23] <Hunterkll> epony: yea, AMD did good with their x64 extensions 
[10:11:31] <epony> see, RISC had 64 bit computers a while ago already
[10:11:34] <Molnija> what can my 8GB desktop, or my 8GB soon 24GB server do, that a 1GB Pentium D system couldn't do in 2005
[10:11:39] <Molnija> er, 2010 probably
[10:11:42] <Hunterkll> intel eventually had to license it back from them, so now it's mutally assured destruction if they get into a legal fight
[10:11:46] <Molnija> dunno if pent D was '05 yet
[10:11:48] <Hunterkll> so they both have to play nice with each other
[10:11:51] <Hunterkll> job security 
[10:12:13] *** Quits: lowfi (~lowfi@user/lowfi) (Quit: Leaving)
[10:12:15] <Hunterkll> Molnija: probably run more than 3 VMs without dying
[10:12:16] <Hunterkll> :P
[10:12:23] <epony> like in the 1996-2000 time fram, but it was not yeat the "node size" that could make massively performing processors so it had workstation resurgence factor
[10:12:31] <Molnija> Hunterkll: Not really.
[10:12:44] <Hunterkll> Molnija: I remember my damn dual socket 32 bit xeon DL380 G3
[10:12:52] <Hunterkll> running more than a few VMs in ESX 3 was painful
[10:13:04] <Hunterkll> even with RAID-10 of Ultra320 SCSI drives and maxed out ram
[10:13:07] <epony> so it's again the thermal and performance / efficiency metric that gives out the production unit costs to the consumer market and the competing edge
[10:13:21] <xe0n> esx 3 was just painful period
[10:13:22] <xe0n> lol
[10:13:24] <Hunterkll> epony: yet, ARM continually wins on performance / efficiency 
[10:13:28] <Hunterkll> xe0n: 3/3.5, i forget wh ich 
[10:13:29] <Molnija> price/performance, and inertia
[10:13:32] <Molnija> INERTIA EPONY
[10:13:32] <Hunterkll> it was ESXi i suspect
[10:13:34] <Hunterkll> the first ESXi releases
[10:13:41] <Hunterkll> in 2004ish ? 2008ish?
[10:13:42] <Hunterkll> something like that
[10:13:42] <xe0n> yeah i remember lol
[10:14:00] <epony> but it needed for the node size to drop to the 14-7nm scale to show it's cometitive edge
[10:14:02] <Hunterkll> ran my home router off of that after virtualizing lol 
[10:14:10] <Hunterkll> epony: except.... it didn't
[10:14:13] <epony> cause on the larger nodes it simply could not produce competing designs
[10:14:16] <Hunterkll> just there wasn't a 'consumer investment' or software
[10:14:19] <Hunterkll> that's not true at all....
[10:14:26] <Hunterkll> but without software library, what's the point?
[10:14:30] <epony> because the processors can not compete
[10:14:35] <Hunterkll> but they absolutely could
[10:14:45] <Hunterkll> AMD was going down the ARM pin/socket compatible route as early as 2012 
[10:15:02] <epony> the software materialises in weeks to months
[10:15:11] <Hunterkll> that's a load of shit and you know it, lol
[10:15:26] <epony> there is no efficient CPU that will stay unused by compilers
[10:15:30] <Molnija> epony: put your money where your mouth is. pit an avantek altra against a similar xeon/epyc in your preferred synthetic that runs on both.
[10:15:34] <Hunterkll> the software for x86_64 only appeared as fast as it did by AMD providing emulators to people before they even had functional silicon 
[10:15:44] <epony> it is actually the companies that produce the CPUs that order teh compilers and ship their own implementations too
[10:15:50] <Hunterkll> epony: oh, it'll stay unused as fuck if no one will buy it - why waste the development effort in it?
[10:16:10] <Hunterkll> the onyl reason x86_64 had huge buyin was because *gasp* it was going to be on every AMD x86 cpu shipping
[10:16:19] <Hunterkll> so it was basically "free" to jump on the bandwagon
[10:16:23] <Hunterkll> with almost zero barrier to en try 
[10:16:26] <Molnija> ayup
[10:16:41] <epony> yes, that's why ARM CPUs were unused in the 90ies, failed to make any processors before the node size shrink that made fabless production a market segment after the 2000s
[10:16:43] <Hunterkll> for years before they had functional silicon, they had system emulators 
[10:17:03] <Hunterkll> lol unused in the 90s? I've got a fair am ount of ARM devices around here from the 90s.....
[10:17:04] <epony> just the CPUs suck for larger computational load ;-)
[10:17:15] <Hunterkll> but that's ... again... not true at all
[10:17:21] <epony> yeah it is
[10:17:30] <Molnija> do I need to hire an oracle altra vps
[10:18:01] <Hunterkll> I mean, intel was the damn leader in ARM development in the early 2000s 
[10:18:01] <Hunterkll> lol
[10:18:05] <Hunterkll> and not just in embedded
[10:18:08] <Molnija> god
[10:18:16] <Molnija> i wish i had a big pool of money lol
[10:18:19] <epony> you can use my nickname
[10:18:32] <epony> request denied ;-)
[10:18:33] <Hunterkll> Molnija: Intel won their ARM division off of DEC in a lawsuit settlmenet 
[10:18:34] <Hunterkll> lol
[10:18:52] <sd> 12<c​ooleb09> this is *still* going?
[10:18:52] <Molnija> i would buy new workstations and pit comparables against each other
[10:18:54] <Hunterkll> Intel still has an ARM license to this day 
[10:18:58] <Molnija> Yes cooleb09
[10:19:04] <Hunterkll> @cooleb09 why would it be "still" when it's a fun discussion? 
[10:19:11] <Hunterkll> would you rather us talk about your favorite horse porn?
[10:19:31] * Molnija falls backwards slowly
[10:19:34] <sd> 12<c​ooleb09> im going about my day and 'doing shit't hen lookign abck oevr and its still the same
[10:19:39] <Hunterkll> sure
[10:19:40] <xe0n> nah he wants to talk about his eggs and how he's buying pc parts while going hungry
[10:19:43] <Hunterkll> because it's a fascinating conversation 
[10:19:44] <xe0n> we already know that story
[10:19:44] <Hunterkll> lol
[10:19:48] <epony> I like how both big CPU vendors got stuck on 14-10nm node
[10:20:06] <Molnija> xe0n: what
[10:20:15] <epony> the smaller node sizes are given to the smaller computer markets for now
[10:20:21] <Hunterkll> epony: i like how evereyone gets hung up on node size, when it's just marketing fluff, and in comparison, intel's 10nm node is essentially TSMC's 7nm node in the actual component measurements where it matters
[10:20:30] <xe0n> or am i talking about some other dude, everyone blends into one here lol
[10:20:33] <Hunterkll> lol
[10:20:38] <epony> it's not marketing, cause there are factories and machines
[10:20:46] <Molnija> you are talking about me with the pc parts and eggs
[10:20:53] <Hunterkll> epony: right, but Intel's 10nm isn't the same as GF's 10nm isn't the same as TSMC's 10nm
[10:20:56] <xe0n> LOL
[10:20:57] <epony> and these get delegated to the more profitable (oversold) device manufacturers
[10:20:59] <Hunterkll> they're all using different part measurements 
[10:21:03] <xe0n> ^
[10:21:22] <epony> so.. the mobile vendors make HUGE profit (but that is lower efficiency for the consumer)
[10:21:29] <Hunterkll> epony: so while say, Intel might be measuring transistor width, TSMC might be measuring trace width, and bo th calling that 10nm
[10:21:32] <epony> so you get the stupid CPUs and pay a LOT of money
[10:21:50] <epony> while servers and workstation business machines get the larger nodes in high production outputs
[10:21:57] <epony> that's how it goes
[10:22:05] <Hunterkll> when in reality, intel's got 10nm transistors with 7nm traces, and TSMC has 10nm traces with 12nm transistors
[10:22:05] <epony> better efficiency on larger computers
[10:22:13] <Molnija> well, i guess i'm going hungry for a few years to buy an Altra
[10:22:22] <epony> worse efficiency due to packaging and thermal problems on smaller computers
[10:22:23] <Hunterkll> epony: only efficiency i've cared about / been fo cusing on is part in your hand, performance per watt
[10:22:27] <Hunterkll> that's the only efficiency that matters
[10:22:42] <Hunterkll> epony: but again, the 'nm' rating of nodes is marketing fluff
[10:22:43] <epony> the real efficiency is, how much work can you get done
[10:23:02] <epony> on a small handheld, you need less compute and longer battery life
[10:23:06] <Hunterkll> with modern ARM CPUs? the same, or sometimes more, than intel, with less power usage 
[10:23:07] <Molnija> you can get more work done per watt on ARM
[10:23:23] <epony> on a stationary computer, you need maxium performance for lower cost
[10:23:45] <Hunterkll> which, given equal power envelopes, ARM is showing to deliver today 
[10:24:03] <epony> and that's why there are no ARM towers and server market is.. "imaginary" or "testing" single production batches
[10:24:11] <Hunterkll> erm
[10:24:17] <Hunterkll> server market is in full swing production from multiple vendors
[10:24:18] <Hunterkll> lol
[10:24:18] <epony> you call that "domination", I call it "fly droppings"
[10:24:22] <Hunterkll> not imaginary or testing
[10:24:24] <Hunterkll> i never said domi nation
[10:24:40] <Hunterkll> yea, no, i can buy racks of ARM servers today without issue
[10:24:42] <Hunterkll> they're not testing
[10:24:43] <epony> yeah, the handheld are not x86 despite ULV models
[10:24:45] <Hunterkll> they're full production swing 
[10:24:48] * xe0n is viewing this channel on an Acorn pc
[10:25:05] <Molnija> epony, your stationary computer statement is only true where watt hours are cheap
[10:25:08] <Hunterkll> there's a slew of vendors to buy ARM server hardware from 
[10:25:08] <epony> then, the stationary are not Arm despite powerful assemblies
[10:25:33] <Molnija> watt hours are cheap here in BC, Canada, so em64t still makes sense here
[10:25:35] <epony> Molnija, over time you will find out it's not all "MINE", but it kind of is in a way
[10:25:36] <Hunterkll> again - market share is on a continual rise. that speaks to some success - just like AMD's x86 market share is on the rise after years of being beat down 
[10:26:30] <Molnija> if watt-hours were expensive, I'd consider an altra if it cost me the same as, or even some hundreds of dollars more than, a comparable em64t
[10:26:33] <epony> there are AMD advantages for dense memory and parallel threaded workloads
[10:26:55] <Molnija> as the TCO would be lower
[10:26:58] <epony> the Intel advantages are faster throughput and higher performance
[10:27:00] <Hunterkll> it's not one single factor 
[10:27:05] <Hunterkll> epony: not always true
[10:27:07] <Hunterkll> again
[10:27:16] <epony> right, just basic comparative analysis
[10:27:18] <Hunterkll> in some scenarios, we've engaged AMD systems for si ngle core performance 
[10:27:28] <Hunterkll> in some scenarios, we go with quad socket quad core intel
[10:27:36] <Hunterkll> it's no longer cut and dry 
[10:27:58] <epony> the majority of HPC deployments use both Intel and AMD CPU nodes and Nvidia and AMD GPU nodes in the clusters
[10:28:03] <Hunterkll> and now, ARM's on our datacenter purchasing radar for some of the governmente cloud platforms we offer - for raw performance reasons 
[10:28:14] <epony> that's cool
[10:28:26] <Hunterkll> but it's COTS ARM stuff
[10:28:28] <Hunterkll> not anything custom 
[10:28:37] <Hunterkll> no "imaginary" or "testing" hardware
[10:28:39] <epony> I wish it could be available as "open architecture" to end consumers like the business market too
[10:28:55] <Hunterkll> again, at least, in the large scale company market, you'll find it's mostly laptops.....
[10:28:57] <Hunterkll> so who cares?
[10:29:03] <Hunterkll> or SFF PCs 
[10:29:08] <epony> the packaging efficiency is low on ARM SBCs
[10:29:16] <Molnija> is micro ATX SFF?
[10:29:17] <Hunterkll> ?
[10:29:19] <epony> so it has higher overhead and lower performance
[10:29:23] <Hunterkll> Molnija: think intel NUC 
[10:29:29] <Hunterkll> epony: ???
[10:29:32] <epony> but I like the scale down mini-ITX form factors too
[10:29:50] <Hunterkll> epony: i think youreally need to dive into the market and update your knowlkedge
[10:29:51] <Hunterkll> lol
[10:29:53] <epony> still using x86 because of software and management control

[10:31:48] <epony> they are.. mobile and armtop (chromebook) models
[10:31:50] <Hunterkll> but it's not what we're buying 
[10:31:52] <epony> and tablets
[10:32:04] <Hunterkll> yea, we're buying things with a fair bit better performance than a chromebook
[10:32:05] <Hunterkll> lol
[10:32:09] <Molnija> gah
[10:32:22] <epony> yeah, we're buying tons of x86 server and workstation boards
[10:32:36] <Hunterkll> why the hell are you buying boards?
[10:32:39] <Hunterkll> *shrug*
[10:32:39] <epony> cause it's COMMODITY COMPUTING
[10:32:43] <Hunterkll> you must have more ti me to waste than we do
[10:32:52] <epony> that's what all businesses do
[10:32:54] <Hunterkll> we just hawk a PO at dell or HP or whatever for a few racks of X config 
[10:32:58] <Hunterkll> no
[10:33:02] <epony> you're consumers
[10:33:18] <Hunterkll> right, who know a cost sink (paying people to put shit together) when we see one
[10:33:33] <epony> businesses are data centre facilities and office computers integrators
[10:33:49] <Hunterkll> uhuh
[10:33:55] <Hunterkll> yep
[10:34:20] <epony> yeah, most efficient data centres build computers from componetns onsite and order their modified designs based on general server and workstation chipset board designs
[10:34:22] <Hunterkll> epony: we run a slew of datacenters in support of multiple customers
[10:34:38] <Molnija> gawd
[10:34:38] <epony> but you stock them with consumer integrated already units
[10:34:44] <Hunterkll> in fact, we compete head to head directly in a specific government market segment with Azure and AWS 
[10:34:46] <epony> you're not competing with the integrator
[10:35:08] <Hunterkll> maybe when we go up, we'll start ordering custom designed hardware
[10:35:20] <epony> while businesses in the data centre provisioning are competing with integrators
[10:35:24] <Hunterkll> but until then, w hile we're just a lowly F100 operation, it's not cost effective to stock our 10+ datacenters like that
[10:35:53] <epony> it's just as efficient for in house deployments to use consumer server and workstation and compact server boards too
[10:36:20] <epony> you can't stock your data centre with iPhones, it would SUCK due to low efficiency on cost, packaging and thermal/performance
[10:36:24] <Hunterkll> Oh, that involves actually having staff.....
[10:36:28] <Hunterkll> epony: but we're not?
[10:36:49] <epony> data centres need staff anyway
[10:37:06] <Hunterkll> epony: only occasionally, if built right. most of our operations are hands-off lights out 
[10:37:27] <epony> you still have staff only it's not yours control
[10:37:37] <Molnija> to say nothing of the lack of mission critical reliability and availability features like ECC in consumer grade HW
[10:37:40] <Hunterkll> sure, a gate guard at the facility who has no access to inside 
[10:37:47] <epony> they are data centre techs and hardware maintenance monkey module swappers
[10:38:02] <epony> that the integrators pay to work on site
[10:38:15] <Hunterkll> epony: sure, we have a guy go in once a month to handle any faiulres or whatever, or as needed - we do keep at least one sr admin/eng within 2-3 hours driivng distance
[10:38:22] <epony> yeah, don't confuse yourself it's like in the movies ;-)
[10:38:26] <Molnija> Hunterkll may be the only person here rich enough to have laid their hands on an avantek or similar

[10:39:37] * MrGibby tips fedora at DrGibby 
[10:39:40] <Molnija> wh
[10:39:44] <Hunterkll> epony: we only send someone to drive in when something is alerting/near critical that doesn't have enough hotspare to last an expected outage window, othewrise, we replace/service failures all at once monthly 
[10:39:44] <DoTheNeedful> s/does/dose
[10:39:45] <layer8> Hunterkll meant: "epony: we only send someone to drive in when something is alerting/near critical that dosen't have enough hotspare to last an expected outage window, othewrise, we replace/service failures all at once monthly "
[10:40:21] <epony> that's a lot lower efficiency than qualified personnel on site servicing all computers like in-house own staff does

[10:40:41] <Molnija> it's actually higher efficiency, epony
[10:40:43] <epony> that's why you can't really compete with the data centre providers, you compete with other leasing / renting companies
[10:40:48] <Hunterkll> epony: but why? they go in, swap parts, send to vendor for replacement, wash and repeat next month, and they go back to being full time back end engineering 
[10:41:11] <epony> Molnija, dude.. we have to tweak your humour level a bit
[10:41:46] * epony slaps Molnija with an off by -5% lightning
[10:41:59] <Molnija> is this whole discussion a joke to you?
[10:42:12] <Hunterkll> Molnija: pretty much
[10:42:17] <Hunterkll> you just have to roll with it
[10:42:20] <Molnija> fuck...
[10:42:27] <Hunterkll> you have to take some of it tounge in cheek
[10:42:35] <Molnija> can i just be a server room fox
[10:42:38] <Hunterkll> while a lot of it is serious, it's prone to exaggeration 
[10:42:45] <Hunterkll>  or hyperbole 
[10:43:13] <Hunterkll> epony: but no, it's great because we just don't have to pay that 24/7 staff - we have two datacenters 24/7 staffed, and they're also hybrid callcentere/major sites/offices
[10:43:20] <Molnija> is it bad that if i built a datacentre, every rack would have a hole big enough for a small dog to jump through
[10:43:55] <Molnija> not that it'd be accessible to any potential DC dogs..
[10:43:56] <Hunterkll> Molnija: as long as the dogs are chipped, so we can use RFID sensor/timing logs to determine who's dog pissed on what
[10:44:29] <epony> so, your business turned out expensive with POWER servers and now you're turning to other expensive ARM servers ;-) nicee
[10:44:46] <Molnija> expensive in total, cheap per watt and per teraflop
[10:44:50] <Hunterkll> epony: oddly enough, POWER is one of the few things we really don't have 
[10:45:01] <epony> you must be running VMs cause there is not enough software for those platforms
[10:45:05] <Hunterkll> epony: but in our sector, we spank MS and AWS in price :P
[10:45:13] <epony> ah
[10:45:19] <epony> so you're a x86 shop after all ;-)
[10:45:24] <Hunterkll> epony: bulk of fleet is x86, ARM is only coming into demand because of customer requests 
[10:45:25] <epony> MUAHAHAHAHAHA.
[10:45:39] <Hunterkll> epony: but a quarter of our revenue in that sector is POWER and z/Arch
[10:45:50] <epony> ok good
[10:46:07] <Molnija> my personal residence is an em64t shop. we have ONE 32-bit x86 processor and it's not in a system.
[10:46:07] <Hunterkll> but ARM is slowly growing racks
[10:46:26] <Hunterkll> Molnija: lol we have a production dell 1650
[10:46:29] <Hunterkll> dual socket pentium 3 xeon 
[10:46:30] <Hunterkll> :D
[10:46:31] <epony> Molnija, you mean you bought one old computer that your previous work place disposed off
[10:46:42] <epony> because they made a business mistake which you paid for
[10:46:47] <Molnija> epony: not quite
[10:46:55] <Molnija> but probably
[10:46:56] <Molnija> lol
[10:47:04] <epony> see, the humour tunable is working
[10:47:09] <Hunterkll> yea i saw the IBM X365 and the Dell 1650 when we re-racked that datacenter move 
[10:47:12] <Molnija> it's not
[10:47:14] <Hunterkll> and i was like
[10:47:15] <Hunterkll> what
[10:47:23] <Hunterkll> "just ping this ip and tell us when it's up don't ask questions"
[10:47:54] <Hunterkll> that 1650's since been moved to another datacenter
[10:47:57] <Hunterkll> and is still in operation
[10:47:58] <Molnija> and i say 'we' even though there is only one human body for certain reasons
[10:48:08] <Molnija> jesus christ. And why can't it be consolidated?
[10:48:09] <epony> what no 1950s and 2950s for you
[10:48:12] <epony> that's old

[10:49:03] <Hunterkll> epony: I have two 2950's that i turn on occasionally (to OS patch, mind you :P ) when it gets cold in winter
[10:49:11] <Hunterkll> Computers are just as efficient as space heaters
[10:49:13] <Hunterkll> so why not?
[10:49:22] <Molnija> second spittake in as many days
[10:49:38] <epony> I'm heating with CPUs too
[10:49:39] <Molnija> David Pakman reporting that donald trump ate sensitive notes
[10:49:42] <Hunterkll> Molnija: that's actually a true fact, they're within ~1%  efficiency of each other for converting power to heat
[10:49:59] <Molnija> Hunterkll: I know that
[10:50:00] <Hunterkll> so i turn on my 2950's when it's cold to patch them and warm up my room
[10:50:00] <Hunterkll> lol
[10:50:14] <Molnija> and electric space heating costs 3x as much as methane here
[10:50:29] <Hunterkll> we've got oil heat, but it's a decent sized house
[10:50:33] <Hunterkll> so it's cheaper to do it per-room
[10:50:45] <Molnija> you're in the boondocks, without propane or methane?
[10:51:04] <Hunterkll> oil heat, propane stove/oven, well water :P
[10:51:07] <Molnija> or a big city but it's just not a thing
[10:51:10] <Molnija> ah
[10:51:21] <epony> US is not susceptible to massive gas provisioning, also the same problem with networking..
[10:51:25] <Hunterkll> farming valley, not too far from a major city though 
[10:51:31] <Molnija> boondocks. And why isn't your propane tank sized for house heat?
[10:51:39] <Hunterkll> but yea, power goes out, we pull up the generator, it's like the power never went out
[10:51:42] <Molnija> is oil cheaper
[10:51:55] <Hunterkll> yea, untaxed diesel basically
[10:51:58] <Hunterkll> more complex than that but yea
[10:52:09] <unorgaacount> we still talking about cpus
[10:52:11] <epony> rural regions get oil heating typically
[10:52:17] <Molnija> unorgaacount: sorta
[10:52:17] <Hunterkll> i just yank the wall plugs on my rack and desk and fish tank, hook 'em to a strip, throw 'em to the octopus leads to the deck generator
[10:52:30] <Molnija> epony: here it's that, electric or propane
[10:52:50] <epony> same, electric and propane
[10:53:01] <Hunterkll> we're basically the only lit up house lol
[10:53:08] <Hunterkll> my basement switch once survived a 7 day power outage
[10:53:09] <Hunterkll> :D
[10:53:24] <epony> well, we have also wood and oil storage, but don't tell anyone
[10:53:25] <Hunterkll> sadly the UPS batteries kicked the bucket before i got a 5 year screenshot :(
[10:53:26] <Molnija> my old apartment, in a major city!, was electrically heated. in the same city my houne is methane heated
[10:53:49] <epony> what good is a one lit house when all the rest are not
[10:53:54] <Molnija> well. if 80k and two highways is major
[10:53:57] <epony> you'll get zombies and still no internet
[10:54:12] <epony> no 80K is not major
[10:54:27] <epony> but concrete buildings is
[10:54:45] <epony> it's not about the total population size, but about the density of the significant larger part
[10:54:46] <Molnija> costco is set up here, but we don't have much concrete, it's weird
[10:54:53] <Hunterkll> Molnija: here's the last screenshot i got before the great UPS failure :'(

[10:56:43] <epony> it's alright
[10:56:43] <Hunterkll> Molnija: to be fair, one of the batteries in the UPS chain is green tagged, which means suspected early fail....
[10:56:48] <Hunterkll> whatever
[10:56:52] <epony> eventually you have a firmwre upgrade to perform
[10:56:57] <unorgaacount> what happend

[10:59:13] <Hunterkll> lol
[10:59:15] <epony> so it's got a 10 year uptime boost built-in
[10:59:47] <epony> probably still works fine
[11:00:02] <Hunterkll> yea but i've already exploited the shit out of it to run my own code
[11:00:03] <Hunterkll> lol
[11:00:14] <Molnija> oh
[11:00:14] <Hunterkll> in fact i've exploited it to restart the management stack when it crashed to log back into it
[11:00:19] <epony> I got a couple not very cheap trendnet dumb switches that I've repaired into eternity
[11:00:30] <Hunterkll> dumb switches yer a fair bit safer with
[11:00:31] <Molnija> hm
[11:01:03] <epony> was a popular consumer brand in 2000-2002
[11:01:06] <Molnija> i* once had a rackable cisco switch in my bedroom
[11:01:09] <Hunterkll> HERE IT IS
[11:01:09] <Molnija> i think

[11:01:12] <Molnija> i don't remember
[11:01:16] <epony> so is 20+ years up here
[11:01:18] <Hunterkll> 1536/365 = 4.20 
[11:01:23] <Hunterkll> THE 420 SCREENSHOT
[11:01:51] <Molnija> aha
[11:01:56] <epony> and I don't count uptime cause I run snapshots and production maintenance separately
[11:02:07] <Hunterkll> epony: i only run uptime on shit that can't be updated
[11:02:12] <Hunterkll> otherwise i'm paranoid about patches
[11:02:14] <epony> and still get to audit and reboot machines at scheduled intervals
[11:02:22] <epony> yeah good
[11:02:47] <unorgaacount> up time should be less than a week

[11:03:03] <epony> monthly cycles are more predictable
[11:03:11] <Hunterkll> aaand we found the pretender
[11:03:47] <xe0n> less than a week?!
[11:03:48] <epony> I like my women to have monthly maintenance, weekly is a bit dramatic.
[11:04:23] <Molnija> ah yes, sexism.

[11:17:36] <nobyk> so the 3d printer is still borked
[11:17:46] <nobyk> I still think it's all about the pad leveling
[11:17:51] <nobyk> it's just not there yet
[11:18:08] <nobyk> like after the 1st or second layer the print starts to curl up and off the pad
[11:18:24] <nobyk> so the printhead thingy bumps into it really and knocks it off

[11:41:19] <JollyRgrs> 1) I went for a while w/o any either.... GAME. CHANGER! makes life much easier... look into adding a bltouch or something
[11:41:52] *** Joins: Lancehead (~root@user/lancehead)
[11:42:08] <JollyRgrs> 2) have you tried the n-point (like 9 point) test where you move the x/y around to different points and then take nozzle down until it touches the paper or whatever... and mark the differences?
[11:42:23] <Lancehead> Morning fellas, fellaettes and often forgotten (but not by me) people running on exactly an hour and a half of sleep
[11:42:30] <nobyk> Yeah similarly we were fine for like a year or something just printing away
[11:42:32] <Lancehead> (send help)
[11:42:37] <nobyk> now it's just borking everytime
[11:43:11] <nobyk> Well I do a paper thing
[11:43:12] <JollyRgrs> https://all3dp.com/2/ender-3-bed-leveling-all-you-need-to-know/
[11:43:20] <nobyk> but it's just ball park measuring really
[11:43:31] <nobyk> have it come down on where the pad screws are and in the middle
[11:43:34] <JollyRgrs> so... i found that when using the glass plate, i found an issue...
[11:43:47] <JollyRgrs> i would actually have teh corners LOWER than they should be
[11:43:58] <nobyk> put paper inbetween and if there's "some" resistence I hope that does it
[11:44:06] <nobyk> that's how we did it before
[11:44:16] <JollyRgrs> like the glass plate was flat, but the metal heat plate was not flat. so I could adjust knobs and it wouldn't even move my plate
[11:44:20] <SirSceptalot> morning Lancehead 
[11:44:28] <SirSceptalot> bad night of sleep again?
[11:44:29] <Molnija> Lancehead: Sleep trouble?
[11:44:31] <JollyRgrs> that's how i did it prior to getting a bltouch
[11:44:44] <JollyRgrs> so i'd suggest start over from scratch
[11:44:54] <nobyk> we have a glass one now too
[11:44:58] <JollyRgrs> tighten up all knobs all the way
[11:45:11] <JollyRgrs> then loosen them the same # of turns
[11:45:11] <nobyk> we thought maybe the pad is like, worn down or something so got a new one
[11:45:14] <JollyRgrs> then start leveling from there
[11:45:17] <nobyk> then cleaned the nozzle too but still
[11:45:18] <Lancehead> Yeah SirSceptalot/Molnija: Used to have horrible insomnia and I relapse into it sometimes 
[11:45:19] <nobyk> it curls
[11:45:31] <JollyRgrs> well, if it is CURLING, that might not be a leveling issue
[11:45:39] <JollyRgrs> the curl would throw things off and get in the way of the nozzle
[11:45:49] <JollyRgrs> so you have glass... you do the glue stick trick?
[11:45:51] <JollyRgrs> or hair spray?
[11:45:53] <JollyRgrs> or anything?
[11:45:58] <nobyk> I figure it's the first layer not sticking down hard enough
[11:46:05] <SirSceptalot> I'd love to give you some advice Lancehead, but I've never had that so...
[11:46:19] <nobyk> and last time I was like moving the pad up and that seemed to work actually
[11:46:25] <SirSceptalot> best I can do is "lay down, fall asleep", and that might not be 100% useful advice
[11:46:27] <Lancehead> All good, I know how to get back out of it but it's just a shitty tour of sleeping bad for a while lol 
[11:46:32] <nobyk> it was less curly
[11:46:40] <JollyRgrs> so, i can tell you 100% filament matters... some brands will stick differently/better than others, and at diff bed temps
[11:46:43] <nobyk> glue stick sounds like it'll ruin the pad
[11:46:47] <JollyRgrs> nope
[11:47:02] <JollyRgrs> you said you have glass, right?
[11:47:07] <nobyk> just any run of the mill staples glue stick ?
[11:47:08] <Lancehead> Basically the trick is to have discipline and keep getting up at the same time SirSceptalot, but that does lead to me sleeping like 2hrs/night for about a week usually
[11:47:27] <JollyRgrs> yeah... i prefer the "purple that dries clear" (well, tbh... that's just what we had at the house)
[11:48:00] <SirSceptalot> eesh
[11:48:09] <Lancehead> Ughh I have to make a call to our MSP because they forgot to make a ticket for me after I called day before yesterday and I REALLY don't feel like it 
[11:48:44] <JollyRgrs> i don't have insomnia, but have one of those horrible natural sleep cycle offset things... I can finally get to where I can go to sleep at a decent time and wake up at a decent time... but if I get out of rythmn just one night (even after a month or two of doing good), I slip up and have a horrible time waking up in the AM and don't seem tired until 3-4am at night
[11:49:31] <Lancehead> Yeah I get that too, and randomly alongside it 
[11:49:42] <nobyk> I am hardwired to sleep either 5-6hours or 12 hours
[11:49:46] <nobyk> there's no inbetween
[11:49:58] <Molnija> i wonder if altra 80 core is powerful enough for software-rendered gaming
[11:50:06] <nobyk> 8hours? hah nice try. How about lying awake untill it's time for your normal 6hours boi
[11:50:46] <JollyRgrs> sounds like me... except the 3-4 hrs sleep is b/c i just go to bed late and have work in the morning
[11:50:58] <JollyRgrs> i'd gladly sleep 8-10 hrs or even 12... but nooooo
[11:51:06] <Lancehead> Suckiest part for me is I got addicted to melatonin tablets as a teenager because I didn't want therapy so now it doesn't work anymore :^)) 
[11:51:21] <Molnija> hm
[11:51:24] <Lancehead> I just have to wait to fall asleep, whenever that might happen 
[11:51:33] <Molnija> melatonin works for me sometimes
[11:52:04] <JollyRgrs> nobyk: here... here's a good thing to help https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9h4ofWlGNo (he even says don't use glue stick)
[11:52:07] <Lancehead> It used to work for me all the time, but you're not supposed to take it every night and then up the dosage when it stops working >_>
[11:52:26] <JollyRgrs> don't OD on melatonin either
[11:52:28] <Molnija> you are supposed to tolerance break
[11:52:42] <Lancehead> yeah exactly, I never did
[11:53:01] <nobyk> Wait.. DON'T use glue stick?
[11:53:28] <Lancehead> Well no definitely don't try to use a glue stick to fall asl-- oh never mind 
[11:53:41] <Molnija> i was prescribed to use melatonin chronically as a preteen
[11:53:55] <JollyRgrs> nobyk: lol, tbh, with the right filament you don't need to with the glass bed
[11:54:06] <nobyk> Take a glue stick and dip it in alcohol. Shove that up ur ass and that'll knock you right out
[11:54:06] <Molnija> it only worked until i figured out how to fight it
[11:54:11] <JollyRgrs> with some cheaper stuff, i seemed to have to... but i never "primed" my bed like this guy did

[12:45:16] <nobyk> is that german?
[12:45:58] <DrZak> but, apparently some demented zoophiliac decided, ah, why not use the rest of the numbers between 100 and 253 somewhere along, so, its now more confusing, since some parameters count from 200 to 0
[12:46:24] <sloth_on_meth> nobyk: dutch haha
[12:46:39] <sloth_on_meth> DrZak okay so i dont need to worry about the pre_fail things?
[12:46:57] <DrZak> just read that article, its nicely written and gives me the ragies
[12:47:02] <sloth_on_meth> ok
[12:47:08] <nobyk> another dutchie
[12:47:23] <CptLuxx> throw the disks away
[12:47:25] <sloth_on_meth> the thing im worried about is - If it is Pre-fail, then the attribute is considered a critical attribute, one that participates in the overall SMART health assessment (PASSED/FAILED) of the drive. If the value of WORST falls below THRESH, then the drive FAILS the overall SMART health test, and complete failure may be imminent. The Pre-fail term
[12:47:25] <sloth_on_meth> means that if this attribute fails, then the drive is considered 'about to fail'.
[12:47:31] <sloth_on_meth> ohhhh
[12:47:32] <DrZak> i mean, what the f is wrong with coders and error reporting
[12:47:34] <Lancehead> Godverdomme, nog een kandidaat om mijn fiets te stelen @ sloth_on_meth
[12:47:48] <DrZak> is it some kind of cyber-syphilis?

[12:48:09] <Kiernian> https://visdeurbel.nl/about-the-fishdoorbell/
[12:48:16] <sloth_on_meth> so basically, it's saying that *if* that attribute were to get below treshold, it would be pre-fail. it is not currently pre-fail. correct?
[12:48:18] <Lancehead> What the fuck lol 
[12:48:30] <DrZak> one you start coding, you brain gets fried and you suddenly lose the ability to write a simple information if something stops working why did it

[15:08:18] <interop_madness> (lengthy) question regarding correct client-side SMTP-behavior: suppose this is Exchange's response to a EHLO on port 25: https://paste.ee/r/PPxcl/0 - now, Exchange is configured to allow authentication but in the receive connector for port 25, ExchangeUsers is not part of the permission groups. a SMTP client connects to port 25, notices "hey, the server supports authentication" and thus attempts to authenticate with 
[15:08:19] <interop_madness> the current process user's credentials. this fails, since the user would map to ExchangeUsers, which is disabled. is it correct behavior that authentication fails and it's over, or should the client fall back to anonymous, since anonymous is also allowed for port 25?
[15:09:33] <interop_madness> my guess would be the former (auth => fail without fallback) since auth is part of the capabilities, so a client connecting can reasonably excpect to be authenticable, given valid credentials
[15:10:08] <interop_madness> meaning: the problem should be solved by connecting to port 587 to begin with

[16:59:22] <monr0e> The EU stipulated many years ago that gooods must be sold in metric weights - i.e. litres, kilograms, y'know. We have always sold milk in pints - so we still sell milk in piints, but a pint is equivalent to 1.136l. Malicious compliance, I should think

[20:28:00] <JollyRgrs> but glad it is fixed
[20:28:32] <Oliber> something installed without quoted paths, maybe was an old/bad MS installer, but normally they're well behaved
[20:28:43] <JollyRgrs> i've seen similar issues in the past where when relying on $PATH or one of the %foldershortcuts% just got tripped up b/c it wasn't 100% implemented right (it was done lazy)
[20:28:50] <JollyRgrs> Oliber: exactly
[20:29:39] <JollyRgrs> or even a non-MS thing just copying an MS file to its own programs folder... but instead no quotes and copied to the file c:\Program
[20:29:54] <Oliber> true, that is more likely
[20:30:03] <teh_f4ll3n> the only thing that was installed between "working" and "broken" was windows updates
[20:30:32] <teh_f4ll3n> it's my test vm

[22:21:01] <sd> 06<o​nenerdyguy> speaker spikes are trying to make the speaker 'float' so it doesn't couple with the surface it's on

[22:24:08] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> I'm assuming the noise is from the printer shaking shit hence the spikes decouple. Not really a whole lot you can do to make the printer itself quieter.
[22:24:14] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> But you're probably right
[22:25:14] <sd> 04<F​eralTerminator> Yeah, just the printer shaking from all the motors and it being on a wood table. The printer it's self is actually fairly quiet once you put it on foam.
[22:25:41] <nobyk> I never thought it would be this sensitive
[22:25:49] <nobyk> we were printing fine for like a year, life was good
[22:26:09] <nobyk> and now it's just curling all the time and then the next time the nozzle comes by it knocks the whole thing off

[22:27:17] <sd> 04<F​eralTerminator> The auto leveler has a little rod that goes around and it measures the distance of the bed at different points, then auto corrects the print for that difference

[22:28:25] <sd> 06<o​nenerdyguy> yeah, I'd heat to 80, and hten go down to 70

[22:29:15] <shakygator>  pla is supposed to cool though i heard its got problems in an enclosure
[22:29:19] <shakygator> so they leave the door open anyways
[22:29:27] <shakygator> i dont have an enclosure
[22:29:28] <sd> 06<o​nenerdyguy> it depends on if you ahve wind of not

[22:29:39] <sd> 06<o​nenerdyguy> also, I low key hate pla, and went mostly abs
[22:29:46] <nobyk> oh so I set the initial temperature to 80

[22:29:58] <sd> 06<o​nenerdyguy> yeah, you want to heat up and have it stick well, then let it drop
[22:29:58] <shakygator> PLA do 60* bed temp and use glass bed with elmers glue stick
[22:30:03] <nobyk> and then the other I'll do 75
[22:30:07] <sd> 06<o​nenerdyguy> meh, I'm not a fan of hte glue stick
[22:30:11] <shakygator> it works
[22:30:13] <nobyk> since it's just a room, and no enclosure
[22:30:24] <shakygator> if i dont use it i have issues, way easier than tape and better
[22:30:26] <sd> 04<F​eralTerminator> I mist the bed with hair spray to help it stick
[22:30:40] <nobyk> I'm hesitant on the glue stick. I don't want to make a mess
[22:30:59] <nobyk> 60 seems low, compared to the 80
[22:31:12] <nobyk> shakygator: 
[22:31:22] <nobyk> do you recommend a slower printing speed if it's a smaller part?
[22:31:23] <shakygator> i think he meant 80 internal enclosure temp, not bed temp
[22:31:34] <shakygator> i do slower first layer to make sure i get good adhesion

[22:32:53] <nobyk> what is slow tho
[22:33:41] <nobyk> initial layer speed, like 10mm/s? and then the rest like 30 or something
[22:34:11] <shakygator> you can print PLA at 80mm
[22:34:23] <nobyk> wtf 80mm
