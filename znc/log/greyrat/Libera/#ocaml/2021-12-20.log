[00:17:53] <d_bot> <NULL> Is there a way to have VSCode's extension work with .merlin files ? It doesn't seem to work anymore, or at least out-of-the-box
[00:20:15] <companion_cube> .merlin files are no longer needed, at least if you use dune
[00:20:50] <d_bot> <NULL> I'm on an older project which doesn't use dune, hence the question
[00:21:09] <d_bot> <NULL> (Namely, I'm trying to look into Why3)
[00:22:16] <companion_cube> Hmm, and they have merlin files?
[00:24:30] <d_bot> <NULL> Yeah (I think there's only one)

[04:47:57] <raftas> related: i tried using dream but vscode can't seem to recognize it
[04:48:01] <raftas> any tips on how to fix this :l
[04:48:15] <raftas> everything works fine, the linter just is sad
[04:49:24] <d_bot> <NULL> Look at the previous messages : the project is big so installing dune on it would be annoying
[04:50:34] <rgrinberg> if the project is so big, manually written .merlin files take just as long to write as dune files
[04:52:14] <d_bot> <NULL> .merlin files should already be well set up, the project is still active so I imagine the devs use merlin and not the LSP server
[05:24:54] <raftas> btw anyone know of big ocaml open source projects looking for new contributors?
[05:25:15] <raftas> i was asked this today and couldn't come up with a good answer...
[05:27:00] <companion_cube> I don't know if big projects particularly _seek_ contributors
[05:27:08] <companion_cube> typically contributors are people scratching their own itch
[05:27:35] <companion_cube> you could try to find a project you like, and seek ways to improve for your use case, and see if maintainers would be interested
[05:28:50] <raftas> there was an idea floating around of running an intro ocaml workshop where as a final project participants would go and contribute to open-source ocaml projects
[05:29:21] <raftas> for machine learning this has been relatively successful, with people end up contributing to tensorflow, keras, etc
[05:29:56] <companion_cube> if it's your jam there is Owl, I suppose.
[05:30:16] <raftas> i do know about owl, though it seems mostly dead
[05:30:37] <companion_cube> there's also tensorflow bindings (I think? and Torch?) but it's a one person thing
[05:30:40] <companion_cube> a very good person tho.
[05:31:22] <raftas> this? https://github.com/LaurentMazare/tensorflow-ocaml
[05:32:05] <companion_cube> yep
[05:35:28] <raftas> i wasn't targeting machine learning, more open source
[05:36:04] <raftas> i was using machine learning more of an example of "open source being used as a successful learning tool"
[05:36:13] <companion_cube> right
[05:36:29] <companion_cube> well idk, what kind of programs are you interested in?
[05:37:21] <raftas> i was considering getting a bunch of people to work on the compiler... but that may be too intense and the learning curve could be too steep
[05:37:50] <companion_cube> ah, yeah, the compiler isn't the easiest
[05:37:51] <raftas> i think generally people would be interested in infrastructure though
[05:38:02] <companion_cube> there's odoc, dune…
[05:38:18] <raftas> is dune easy to contribute to...?
[05:38:44] <rgrinberg> i think it's pretty easy
[05:39:02] <rgrinberg> but I think this way of going about things is exactly backwards.
[05:39:04] <raftas> i'll have to look into that as an option then
[05:39:31] <rgrinberg> I'd ask the students what they're interested in, and then look for the projects
[05:40:05] <raftas> it's gonna be a bunch of PL people :P
[05:40:20] <raftas> but yes, i'll certainly do that
[05:40:38] <rgrinberg> well then, dune is going to be quite boring for them then
[05:41:05] <rgrinberg> there's lots of projects somewhat related to PL though
[05:41:24] <raftas> got a list somewhere?
[05:42:26] <rgrinberg> just off the top of my head: merlin, stan, coq, rotor, frama-c
[05:43:09] <rgrinberg> why3
[05:44:13] <raftas> thanks, this is helpful
[05:45:57] <d_bot> <Et7f3> PL ?
[05:46:14] <raftas> programming languages
[05:47:29] <companion_cube> what's stan? there's no opam package by that name :D
[05:49:01] <rgrinberg> https://github.com/stan-dev/stanc3
[05:49:33] <rgrinberg> that reminds me, there's also haxe - that wierd PL also written in OCaml
[05:50:22] <rgrinberg> i think they were even looking to hire someone not too long ago
[05:50:30] <rgrinberg> that means they're definitely interested in contributions
[05:50:32] <raftas> tl;dr of why haxe is cool? :)
[05:50:35] <companion_cube> oh it vaguely rings a bell, is stan a probabilistic language?
[05:50:43] <rgrinberg> companion_cube it is
[05:51:05] <rgrinberg> raftas it can transpile to just about any other planguage

[06:03:30] <d_bot> <minimario> i've heard the term a lot when people are talking about ocaml but have no idea what they are haha
[06:04:03] <companion_cube> you might find slides about multicore OCaml + effects, or look at https://github.com/koka-lang/koka
