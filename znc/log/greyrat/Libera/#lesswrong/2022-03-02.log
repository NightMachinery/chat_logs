[05:17:42] <enterprisey> isn't he (bicyclist) going the wrong way for that bike lane?
[05:18:05] <ggreer> he's blocking that car on purpose. the car isn't supposed to go through there (everyone does though because those fucking things don't always show up on maps)
[05:18:19] <enterprisey> I suppose there's a "do not enter" on the other side?
[05:18:49] <ggreer> I mean that gap is for bicycles only. cars aren't supposed to go through. the idea is to prevent cars from taking shortcuts through neighborhoods

[10:04:29] <PlanckWalk> I'll save the drowning child if they agree to pay me $1000.  It's not like anyone else is offering to save them!
[10:04:42] <Obormot\Arcturus> adiabatty: Well, that does look interesting and I kinda want to try it

[10:05:03] <adiabatty> BM is a good beer
[10:05:40] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yes it is, one of my favorites for general-purpose "let's have a beer" situations
[10:06:08] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Especially on tap and with an orange slice in it... mmm)
[10:06:19] <Robomot> [Astral Codex Ten] Microaddictions - https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/microaddictions
[10:06:35] <PlanckWalk> Hmm...  replace $1000 with 10% of their income for the rest of their life.  It's still better than drowning!
[10:07:33] <PlanckWalk> And a child is more likely to be able to pay that than $1000 up front.
[10:07:49] <Obormot\Arcturus> PlanckWalk: Of course, the difficulty with such things is that they raise the spectre of (the decision-theoretic analogues of) "the resurrection of dead hypotheses"
[10:08:25] <Obormot\Arcturus> Which is to say: if you're drowning and someone offers to save you for $0.01, duh, losing a penny is worse than drowning. Simple comparison to make.
[10:09:21] <Obormot\Arcturus> If you're drowning and someone offers to save you for $1,000,000, now you have to ask questions like: "ok, but am I *certain* I will drown if not saved? maybe I could save myself? not a high chance, but perhaps life with a small probability is better than life with certainty plus debt slavery?"
[10:10:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> And that, of course, creates incentives, such as: "kid, if you don't pay up, I'll make sure you drown - believe it!"
[10:10:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Not to mention the even more obvious incentive to *create the situation in the first place*!)
[10:11:01] <PlanckWalk> True

[10:12:19] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Everyone always says you should ‚Äúeat mindfully‚Äù." ... who says that?? Fie on them! Fie!!

[10:14:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> "The first minute of watching a movie certainly isn‚Äôt the best; they need time to introduce the characters, start the plot, etc." ... this is why I rate action movies by "how long does it take for exciting shit to start happening on the screen"

[10:20:55] <adiabatty> oh, store brand
[10:20:57] <Obormot\Arcturus> I've made my pan-fried potatoes with it a couple times now - result unambiguously positive. Delicious!
[10:22:18] <adiabatty> how does one make pan-fried potatoes? cast-iron skillet, 1cm of fat, slice potatoes into discs, put potatoes in, flip halfway?

[10:25:42] <Obormot\Arcturus> adiabatty: I made it in non-cast-iron skillets for literally decades before I got my current cast iron one, so that's not even needed. As for the technique, it's simple enough: skillet, fat of choice (beef tallow? olive oil plus butter? something cheaper? whatever, really), potatoes cut into reasonable pieces/slices/wedges/whatevs (new potatoes, skin on, cut along three axes into eighths? sure! plain old Russets, peeled, cut
[10:25:43] <Obormot\Arcturus>  into half-inch-thick half-circle slices? also works), seasoning (anything goes; just salt? sure! garlic pepper? sure! paprika, parsley flakes, chicken salt? yes, yes, yes); then ...
[10:26:17] <adiabatty> good, because I'm still not keen on buying one yet :P
[10:28:04] <Obormot\Arcturus> adiabatty: ... cover (this is important); heat to high (for your various Teflons, ceramic nonsticks, etc.) or medium-high (for cast iron, carbon steel, etc.); let it fry for 5-ish mins (until you get a nice golden crust on the bottom); reduce heat to low, flip/toss the potatoes (as appropriate for shape of cut), re-cover; and let them slowly finish frying on very low heat until tender
[10:28:06] <nshepperd2> heck yeah chicken salt
[10:29:05] <adiabatty> I may retvrn to potato the next time I'm out buying carbs.
[10:29:45] <Obormot\Arcturus> adiabatty: Comes out delicious. Old technique, comes from the old country, origins lost in mists of time. Now, here's a trick that elevates it from "a tasty way to prepare potatoes" to "top-ten cooking techniques EVAR":
[10:31:53] <Obormot\Arcturus> Say you want to have some meat with your poatoes. Some kotlety, some meatballs, some sausages, whatever. Well, after you've dropped heat to low and flipped your potatoes, put those meat items right on top of those potatoes, under the lid. And while the potatoes finish cooking, the heat and steam from them will warm the meat up, but instead of drying it out, will make it incredibly juicy and delicious; while any juices from the
[10:31:53] <Obormot\Arcturus>  meat will drip down into the oil and over the potatoes, and add to their flavor...
[10:34:19] <Obormot\Arcturus> (And if you want to get even more clever - several minutes before the potatoes are done, lift that lid and crack an egg or two onto there! Re-cover, let it finish cooking...)
[10:35:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Or how about this: after flipping the potatoes, scatter a handful of cherry tomatoes on top of the potatoes, so they burst from the heat and become juicy and amazing)
[10:35:53] <Obormot\Arcturus> Very versatile technique, lots of options, always delicious
[10:38:47] <adiabatty> hmmmMmmmm‚Ä¶

[11:59:36] <feep[work]> the point is that the waves are a backdrop and external motivator, not the primary gameplay loop.

[23:51:59] <gwern> (another way to put it: does anyone doubt that if hitler had had 1 or 2 atomic bombs, he would have not have given the command to use them on berlin or london? does anyone doubt that mao, who out of narcissism and to secure his position launched a cultural revolution which killed more people than an atomic bomb would, would not have used an atomic bomb had he needed to, having boasted about...
[23:52:05] <gwern> ...how china could win nuclear war because it had so many fast-breeding people? so, in the reference class of dictators, if we have 200 other dictators, that puts bomb use at >1%. I think putin is in that reference class. and I have a good deal of confidence he wouldn't use nukes as he goes down. but does that bring me to even 99% confidence?)

[23:59:15] <ggreer> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ground-Based_Midcourse_Defense ABM is stupid expensive
[23:59:16] <Robomot> Ground-Based Midcourse Defense - Wikipedia (Ground-Based Midcourse Defense (GMD) is the United States' anti-ballistic missile system for intercepting incoming warheads in space, during the midcourse phase of ballistic trajectory flight. It is a major component of the American missile defense strategy to counter ballistic missiles, including intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) carrying nuclear, chemical, ‚Ä¶)
[23:59:18] <ggreer> > The system has a "single shot probability of kill" of its interceptors calculated at 56%,[1] with the total probability of intercepting a single target, if four interceptors are launched, at 97%.[1] Each interceptor costs approximately $75 million.[1]
[23:59:24] <gwern> capisce: how confusing. putin can't be satanic, he's backed by the orthodox church!
