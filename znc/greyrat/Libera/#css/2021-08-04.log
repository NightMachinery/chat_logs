[01:09:14] <l__q_> How do, that the two "buttons" have the same size? width and height? https://codepen.io/skorotkiewicz/pen/jOmpRMQ
[01:11:57] <entuland> I see no attempt at giving those two spans the same dimensions
[01:13:22] <entuland> in addition to that, spans are inline, there are some things you can't alter unless you make them display as blocks or inline blocks
[01:13:26] <entuland> all in all, CSS basics
[01:18:37] <entuland> the lack of box-sizing and the fact that one of them has a border also makes them "unable" to look exactly the same
[01:20:18] <entuland> forcing the height to be smaller than the line-height, which in turn is affected by the font size, also makes it screw up the placement as long as you stay within the inline flow (even if you make them inline-block)

[01:44:19] <entuland> read my previous messages and try to fix your code according to my remarks
[01:44:29] <entuland> if there is something which you didn't understand, ask that
[01:44:56] <entuland> you really can't get without understanding what exactly every single declaration does and how it does it

[05:53:29] <entuland> if you really want to learn, do it properly
[05:54:23] <entuland> if you're working on something "big" with a lot of code and markup and rules, take on the habit to test technique in isolation
[05:54:45] <entuland> that really means starting a fiddle _from scratch_ and only put there the bare minimum necessary to achieve a specific result
[05:55:00] <entuland> so that you don't get lost in a lot of unrelated markup / css

[10:13:58] <strive> matsaman: Could it be that the HTML syntax for the aside element is far down on the HTML?

[10:33:14] <matsaman> have to rethink sidebars for small/portrait screens of course
[10:33:26] <matsaman> linearize them or hide them or something
[10:34:08] <strive> matsaman: No problem!
[10:34:24] <matsaman> strive: http://matsaman.nfshost.com/strive.html
[10:34:49] <matsaman> you can get about the same thing a lot of other ways, though
[10:34:57] <matsaman> flexbox, again, you can use position: sticky;
[10:35:08] <matsaman> but this is already pretty damn simple
[10:35:54] <strive> Oh wow
[10:36:03] <strive> So nav acts as the sidebar?
[10:36:08] <matsaman> whoops, left out meta viewport -- fixed: http://matsaman.nfshost.com/strive.html
[10:36:18] <matsaman> I mean, conceptually your side bar is your navigation area
[10:36:27] <matsaman> so the 'nav' element is convenient
[10:36:33] <matsaman> it could just as well be <div id="nav">
[10:36:56] <strive> That was my next question -- should I be using divs?
[10:37:06] <matsaman> I mean there's not much difference
[10:37:09] <matsaman> HTML is a dumb language, but
[10:37:21] <matsaman> if there is an element in the spec that matches what you're trying to do, you may as well do it
[10:37:24] <matsaman> because it conveys meaning
[10:37:28] <matsaman> which is the point of HTML
[10:37:36] <strive> Good point :)
[10:37:41] <matsaman> so since your sidebar is for navigation, 'nav' is great, again
[10:37:51] <matsaman> if it were for a list of meatballs...

[14:51:51] <lucerne> Yes
[14:58:29] <lucerne> I found a solution, which seems to work so far:

[17:52:31] <Emil> On class add I'd like to start an animation. On class removal I'd like to reverse this
[17:53:41] <Emil> For example drag over: add class, start the animation, make the dropzone green, then once the browser no longer gives us those events, we remove the class and I'd like to gracefulyl make the dropzone normal again
[17:54:06] <Emil> So to which elements do I place the animation properties etc?

[17:58:55] <DPA> (Keyframe) animation / transitions are two different things. For transitions, specify for the element with the changing property which properties slowly change and how long the change takes. Then, just override the property when the class is set, and it'll interpolate between the old/new values.
