[02:47:22] <Common-Lisp> man sshfp
[02:47:30] <Catie> My understanding is that signing a tag creates a signature of the commit hash for that tag, which ensures both that the cloned repository on a client's machine is in the same state as it was on the developer's computer, and also that the developer in question is personally guaranteeing the authenticity of the repository and the state thereof. Do I have that about right?
[02:47:36] <chrisb> the way ssh/sshd can check the host key via DNS record

[02:52:40] <technomancy> np. maybe "release files" is clearer than "artifact"
[02:53:16] <Catie> Ah, so my understanding of the concept was just too narrow
[02:54:53] <chrisb> and is an artifact reproducible as long as the tag is the same?

[03:05:15] <chrisb> Catie: i like your explanation of the signing tag. what happens when the commit is squashed/rebased? i sure don't know
[03:05:57] <Catie> No idea! Because that changes prior commits, right? So it would have to recalculate the hash and the old signature wouldn't be valid

[03:07:12] <chrisb> so you see what I am getting at...if more people start signing their commits, maybe more people would question what is going on with squash/rebasing
[03:07:17] *** Quits: emagex (~user@user/emagex) (Quit: ERC (IRC client for Emacs 27.1))
[03:07:44] <Catie> I'm basing my understanding off of an ancient (2009) forum post where Linus Torvalds talks about how signing every commit is pointless (and I'm not sure I agree). The server the page was hosted on appears to be defunct, but the Internet Archive saved a copy
[03:07:47] <Catie> https://web.archive.org/web/20210119055537/https://git.661346.n2.nabble.com/GPG-signing-for-git-commit-td2582986.html
[03:07:47] <rudybot> https://teensy.info/fDoRvkXx9x
[03:08:06] <technomancy> rebasing creates new commits so whoever performed the rebase would control whether the new commits are signed or not, and would use their own key to do so
[03:08:44] <chrisb> you mention "state of the archive" in your comment, so I know you know
[03:09:14] <Catie> So the responsibility for authenticity would fall to the new developer, the old developer wouldn't be able to make any guarantees. That makes sense, yeah

[06:21:26] <Catie> Shucks, I can't believe I didn't think of that
[06:21:47] <aidalgol> Look, this may be an option for you weirdos who can store CNN matrices in your brain, but not us mere mortals.
[06:22:36] <grym> fzf and yt-dlp get me really a bit further than i like to admit to in public 
[06:22:48] <gotwf> well seems you would want your own private data store,  e.g. key value for id and song.  then id and tags.  then join as your heart's desire.
[06:23:16] <aidalgol> Yes, that's exactly what I want.  I want something that makes that easy to manage.
[06:23:22] <gotwf> then the data store would need to have file url to the choon.
[06:23:22] <wgreenhouse> aidalgol: mpd has the concept of "stickers" which are key-value pairs stored in mpd's database rather than in the music files
[06:24:00] <aidalgol> wgreenhouse: Is there an mpd client that can show album art?
[06:24:23] <gotwf> pretty sure there is
[06:24:38] <wgreenhouse> aidalgol: yes
[06:25:19] <wgreenhouse> including the android one (MALP)

[06:27:08] <wgreenhouse> aidalgol: maybe https://github.com/SoongNoonien/mpdevil

[23:39:52] <bpalmer> rudybot: feed me, seymour! the alien directory tree demands.
[23:40:09] <rudybot> bpalmer: seymour cray once asked which would you rather have plowing your field, 1024 chickens or 1 cow
[23:40:43] <bpalmer> I ... I don't know.
[23:41:08] <theothornhill> Devon: Sorry I couldn't be of more help :)
[23:41:10] <bpalmer> does minimum wage apply, or is agriculture given an exemption when hiring livestock?
[23:42:20] <aidalgol> Chickens.  Always.  They're nature's rototillers.

[23:42:37] <aidalgol> A cow will just pug it up.
[23:43:36] <bpalmer> On the other hand, not many foxes will take out a cow.
[23:44:31] <aidalgol> I think 1K chickens can gore a few foxes.

[23:46:05] <bremner> rudybot: does this filesystem make me look VFAT?

[23:53:52] <bpalmer> rudybot: the ending comes when the protagonist realizes they're in a narrative and begins addressing the audience directly -- because the powers that be are afraid of the audience catching on in turn.
