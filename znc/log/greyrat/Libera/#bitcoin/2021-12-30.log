[20:12:34] <King_DuckZ> I haven't watched the video yet, but I have a feeling it contains the answer to your question :)
[20:15:39] *** Quits: dez (uid92154@user/dez) (Quit: Connection closed for inactivity)
[20:16:02] <matthewcroughan> King_DuckZ: Even despite HMRC or the IRS, cryptocurrency is still incredibly empowering, for automation reasons, and because it still gives you, the individual, a lot of power over them. Because all you need to generate a new account that they have no jurisdiction over, is a processor capable of generating a public private keypair.
[20:16:14] <matthewcroughan> So all we're doing is making a VM to shove HMRC or the IRS into. Each wallet address (public key) in this analogy is a VM.
[20:16:41] <matthewcroughan> Because we can still pay our taxes, whilst maintaining privacy, by choice in each case. Each public key you make is given by choice to parties you want to observe the trades.
[20:17:04] <matthewcroughan> It's just so interesting. I'm finding out more about this as I currently am trying to pay my taxes using Koinly.
[20:18:00] <matthewcroughan> It basically means I don't need an accountant, and it also means I have a choice of what to expose and what not to expose.
[20:18:34] <matthewcroughan> if the lightning network is in fact a mixer, it means you can actually implement that without any doubt.
[20:19:22] <buZz> matthewcroughan: i'd love to see you do it and would applaud your efforts
[20:19:32] <buZz> i too think it might be doable
[20:19:34] <matthewcroughan> buZz: well you wouldn't see me doing anything, that's the point
[20:19:34] <King_DuckZ> the question I asked about joinmarket was just about that, as I understand it if I pad taxes through it they'd get their money but they'd have no idea where it came from, so they wouldn't be able to tell if tomorrow I'm buying a sandwich from my own wallet either - but I wanted to hear opinions and stuff about all this
[20:19:36] <buZz> might even already happen
[20:19:40] <buZz> matthewcroughan: ha :D
[20:20:09] <buZz> King_DuckZ: how would they know it came from you regardless?
[20:20:28] <buZz> you are totally allowed to pay tax from (for example) a bank account that isnt yours
[20:20:29] <matthewcroughan> It definitely already works like this, in Monero you can generate as many pubkeys as you want that tie back to your own address, they're called subaddresses.
[20:20:41] <matthewcroughan> These subaddresses cannot derive your original address, yet the money is yours. Each subaddress has its own view key.
[20:20:42] <King_DuckZ> buZz: matching amount?
[20:20:51] <buZz> its not the 'from address' (which bitcoin transactions doesnt have) that identifies your ID , -nor- the amount
[20:21:00] <King_DuckZ> buZz: or pay in fiat, but get the coins through that before cashing them out
[20:21:16] <buZz> that makes zero sense
[20:21:19] <earnestly> I wonder if monero can be implemented on L2
[20:21:36] <buZz> identification of your payments happen on the code you post on the transactions on fiat banking
[20:21:43] <buZz> not amount, not 'from' label
[20:21:49] <King_DuckZ> but usually they should have a dedicated wallet just for your transaction, so if they receive anything there, they will simply assume it's you. that's what exchanges do afaict
[20:22:04] <matthewcroughan> earnestly: it already is, you can make as many channels as you want right?
[20:22:11] <matthewcroughan> these are like payment accounts, subaddresses
[20:22:14] <buZz> King_DuckZ: you are confusing 'wallet' for 'address'
[20:22:16] <buZz> they arent the same
[20:22:28] <earnestly> matthewcroughan: Hm?  L2 being things like lightning, where the baselayer is bitcoin
[20:22:29] <King_DuckZ> buZz: yes, I meant address
[20:22:40] <buZz> King_DuckZ: all wallets can have near infinite addresses
[20:22:54] <matthewcroughan> buZz: in Bitocin right now, I can make subaddresses?
[20:22:56] <buZz> millions, if not billions before you make a address that overlaps with someone else's
[20:22:59] <buZz> matthewcroughan: yes
[20:23:05] <buZz> endless addresses
[20:23:12] <matthewcroughan> Did not know that, what wallets support it?
[20:23:13] <matthewcroughan> https://web.getmonero.org/2019/10/18/subaddress-janus.html
[20:23:18] <buZz> matthewcroughan: all wallets
[20:23:18] <King_DuckZ> buZz: yes, so if you make an address and ask me and only me to send you money there, when you get your payment you can assume it was me
[20:23:34] <matthewcroughan> buZz: can you derive the root address from the subaddress?
[20:23:36] <earnestly> matthewcroughan: These days they're 'HD wallets', which would be all of them
[20:23:42] <earnestly> matthewcroughan: See HD wallets
[20:24:00] <buZz> matthewcroughan: no, you cannot derive the root private key from the public address derived from the public key
[20:24:04] <earnestly> matthewcroughan: https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Deterministic_wallet (better link than google)
[20:24:06] <buZz> you cant even derive the public key from it
[20:24:10] <matthewcroughan> buZz: I'm not asking about the private key
[20:24:15] <matthewcroughan> I'm asking about the original public key
[20:24:23] <buZz> matthewcroughan: the derivation is from the BIP32 private key
[20:24:43] <matthewcroughan> in the monero link I gave you, subaddresses are unrelated to their original addresses, only in that the original address keys can spend the subaddress amounts
[20:24:43] <earnestly> https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0032.mediawiki
[20:24:48] <buZz> there is no public version of that that works , because bitcoin uses BIP32's hardened derivation
[20:24:54] <buZz> matthewcroughan: altcoins are offtopic
[20:24:55] <King_DuckZ> ok well, if anyone's got info, anecdotes or experience to share about joinmarket please highlight me, I'd really like to hear about it
[20:24:59] <matthewcroughan> buZz: no they're not?

[20:25:33] <buZz> the derivation on BIP32 as used on bitcoin is hardened
[20:25:34] <earnestly> Though I don't mind seeing how features from them can benefit bitcoin, L2 stuff
[20:25:40] <buZz> you cannot derive the root key from the addresse

[20:27:01] <King_DuckZ> that was a shameful and pointless muscle flexing, I'm out of this conversation

[20:30:15] <King_DuckZ> I mean, no need to ban really, if I should be afraid to ask questions here just say so and I'll leave straight away
[20:30:26] <buZz> you dont need to prune if you dont let it proliferate

[20:38:12] <earnestly> I sympathise with monero and its goals, but it should have been built on bitcoin (L2)
[20:38:15] <binaryFate> buZz: then stop discussing offtopic stuff + throwing false BS when you do
[20:38:37] <buZz> binaryFate: do you often try to tell ppl who have authority over you what to do?
[20:38:47] <buZz> is that why you have a binary fate?
[20:39:24] <binaryFate> irrelevant, bye

[20:42:52] <King_DuckZ> I don't even know what to say of all this... "we don't need a bullet proof way"... ban people for asking questions... who gave this guy op permissions? when did this channel become toxic? I'm clearly in the wrong place, I don't like this atmosphere at all! and in the meantime my own question just drowned in the noise... I'm clearly in the wrong channel, sayonara people
[20:42:55] <earnestly> I have so much reading to do

[20:43:17] <buZz> 'does anyone know anything about X'
[20:43:18] <earnestly> It works
[20:43:22] <buZz> isnt a question, thats a survey
[20:43:23] <earnestly> See, it works
[20:43:24] <earnestly> lol
[20:43:47] <buZz> i love the millenial attitude to communicating

[20:46:57] <earnestly> (I won't mention this again though because it is offtopic from me too, which is probably rightly bannable, as it is flamebait.  But I can't state how much better things are when you create exclusionary environments that are toxic to the types of users you don't want)
