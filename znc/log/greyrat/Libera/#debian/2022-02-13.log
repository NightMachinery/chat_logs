[00:14:57] <jhutchins> You're only going to get into trouble if you try to administer the whole thing with GUIs.
[00:16:17] <jhutchins> I'm not sure where to point you for basics of how to run a mailserver in the current environment.  I started with the sendmail handbook from ORielly.  It's great for background, but not very applicable today.
[00:16:22] <personx_> even with all the proper secuirty practices and protocols in place to connect thru the vps?
[00:16:47] *** Joins: mihi (~mihi@p200300d0473ae800f9063ade914bba12.dip0.t-ipconnect.de)
[00:16:50] <personx_> oh i've decided to go with iredmail setup with bulleyes on a vps.
[00:17:06] <jhutchins> You need to understand how server authentication works, and how to blacklist spam and malware sources without blocking essential messages,
[00:17:49] <jhutchins> personx_: Oh yes, administration via a text console isn't just about security, it's about the complexities of the multiple background systems.
[00:18:39] <jhutchins> You nave the mail exchange server, an access system (pop, imap, webmail), you have spam filtering, you have encryption and authentication, and delivery filtering.
[00:19:06] <jhutchins> personx_: What you're paying Google for is a lot of work to duplicate.
[00:19:57] <jhutchins> personx_: Since you're running on a commercial VPS you should be alright for source-IP blacklists, but if it's a shared server you're likely to have problems sending.
[00:21:30] <personx_> no no, we'd be using a dedicated ip.
[00:22:52] <jhutchins> personx_: That helps, but it's just one checkbox.  I don't feel like I'm giving you any useful information.  There's a lot out there that's more current than what I can tell you.  Search and read - a LOT.
[00:24:08] <personx_> jhutchins, that's exactly what I'm doing. I'll be checking off all the boxes while toying with the setup before i even think about taking it into production

[02:48:25] <sney> perl module packages are named like libfoo-bar-perl, so you could probably do something like 'apt install lib*-perl' and get most of them, as long as they don't conflict with one another
[02:48:45] <PerfDave> sney: Exactly what I suggested above :)
[02:48:48] <sney> ah, same answer as you already... yes
[02:48:52] <gordonfish> sney: Gah was about to say that, beat me to it :)

[02:49:18] <gordonfish> PerfDave: Ah and you had it better with --simualte above that I missed, well done
[02:50:00] <sney> if you want offline availability of everything, you could download the debian dvd isos that contain them, and add those with apt-cdrom. then at least you would not need internet connectivity to install the actual modules you need to use.

[11:26:42] <nutron> Hey guys, I'm running into a strange issue with Thunderbird.  I scanned a 30 page document into an email, attached each seperate page as a seperate pdf file to the email.  When I try to open it on a bullseye installation it complains that it's not a pdf file.  I save it to the disk, pdfinfo says it's corrupt, and file --mime-type shows it as application/octet-stream.. so not a pdf.  Funny thing is, if I send it to another account running buster (forward the
[11:26:43] <nutron> email from the bullseye machine, to a buster machine) it works fine, they open, they're not corrupt etc...  I assume somehow that this is a problem with Thunderbird, but I can't begin to guess what to do next to get this fixed.

[11:39:38] <enyc> nutron: ... are the files arriving intact when saved, do they have the same SHA256SUM ?  etc.
[11:40:01] <nutron> Package: thunderbird Version: 1:91.5.0-2~deb10u1 on the buster machine, Package: thunderbird Version: 1:91.5.0-2~deb11u1 on the bullseye machine.  So they look like they're identical.

[11:42:37] <nutron> I wouldn't know how to calculate a SHA256SUM when coming from the scanning printer, oh, you mean when I save on each different machine?

[14:20:31] <Khepra> We rent servers. Most of those are dedicated machines with LUKS FDE and initramfs remote unlocking. For some applications, we want to start using the public cloud and disks being virtual there, I'm considering making it easier and more maintainable if we encrypt only some data dirs.
[14:20:45] <Khepra> FDE remote unlock via initramfs is cute but lowers the bus factor.
[14:21:47] <Khepra> the cloud won't be ever used for GDPR sensitive data, that stays on LUKS'd baremetals. But I'd still like to encrypt this. For starters, I'll be migrating the central log servers off of metal, and for taht I really just need file contents encrypted.

[16:32:41] <yuri10> greetings, this morning I see in one of my CI running trivy that libexpat got a vulnerability fixed (https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-22822). Now my issue is the following, I have both a laptop and a desktop, both run bullseye, both get the same /etc/apt/source.list and yet, only the laptop proposed me to upgrade the the
[16:32:41] <yuri10> 2.2.10-2+deb11u1 version that has the fix. In fact it's been some time I feel like I'm not having security upgrades proposed on my desktop and today again I had to manually select the  2.2.10-2+deb11u1 version. I dont know what could cause so if you have any idea what config I could lookk at, most of the time I stay with default config, but I may
[16:32:42] <yuri10> have changed something that is causing this.

[16:54:46] <machaddr> how to exclude one package from apt install command?
[16:55:52] <sussudio> !pinning
[16:55:52] <dpkg> Pinning is a method to choose which version of a package to install when multiple versions are available from <sources.list>.  Bugs are explained at https://web.archive.org/web/20121017070250/http://carlo17.home.xs4all.nl/howto/debian.html#errata .  If you use stable, pinning won't help you from messing up the system, ask me about <backports> instead.  https://wiki.debian.org/AptPreferences

[17:04:26] <Khepra> unless the package is a recommended or suggested dependency, excluding deps is going to install grief.
