[00:00:27] <andreyorst> ToxicFrog: FYI, Fennel also now has a library with a lazy-cat macro which works (mostly) exactly like Clojure's
[00:01:40] <andreyorst> so you if you're sad that you can't use it more often in clojure, you can be even more sad because in fennel it would be needed even more rarely!
[00:01:52] <andreyorst> so it sould make you less sad about Clojure
[00:02:01] <andreyorst> I guess... :)

[12:57:00] <Para> In case you've missed it, this is now a thing https://github.com/babashka/neil
[12:57:58] <leah2> cool
[12:58:43] <Para> I did ask borkdude about the intended full scope and yeah, the idea is to be neil -> bb -> deps,buildtools etc. as a stack so effectively replacing Leiningen.
[12:59:34] <Para> I'm at the "not sure why and at this point I'm too afraid to ask" situation on the Clojurians Slack about why the core comunity has so vehemently moved to deps.edn and simply ignored that builds aren't just compilation...
[13:23:04] <ridcully> i'd guess, that's because it came from cognitect
[13:24:05] <ridcully> so it must be the silver bullet
[13:24:59] <andreyorst> I've tried using deps.edn several times, and it's always fells like writing makefiles, now in edn
[13:25:22] <andreyorst> I'm a bit hyberbolizing
[13:25:32] <opqdonut> oh, to me it feels liek you need a makefile on top of the edn
[13:25:38] <opqdonut> since you can't express dependencies or anything
[13:25:43] <opqdonut> build.clj might be a nice solution though
[13:25:58] <opqdonut> declarative dependencies + imperative build scripts sounds like a nice combo
[13:26:04] <andreyorst> but things like running tests, making uberjars, and other stuff, that we get from leiningen for free, kinda tedious to do for each project
[13:27:50] <andreyorst> as a side effect of me only using lein, I don't understand how am I supposed to add clj-kondo/config to a leiningen project, as they only mention steps for deps.edn based projects, tho I've didn't investigated it much furhter, and I feel lost in deps.edn projects in general. CLI tooling in clojure feels incomplete tbh
[13:53:01] <Para> opqdonut: that's what I've done, Makefile on top of it, that is
[14:01:40] <ridcully> tbf i also use makefiles with all the other build tools
[14:03:28] <Para> It's the easiest way to work with Jenkins builds, really
[14:03:33] <Para> And even my latest GitLab builds use it
[14:04:15] <Para> I pretty much build "make foo" targets which mask the actual shell commands for said step, do the deps in the makefile etc. and the build file usually is just a series of make targets with each target wrapped into some error handling and semantic context :)
[14:04:20] <Para> Works too well.
[14:06:39] <andreyorst> Makefiles itselves are good
[14:06:54] <Para> I love how annoyingly simple they are.
[14:07:07] <Para> Target running too often? YOUR FAULT FOR NOT DECLARING DEPENDENCIES.
[14:07:08] <ridcully> and you get lightning fast shell completion and features like -n in a generic way
[14:07:17] <andreyorst> rules can get pretty complicated thoigh
[14:07:41] <Para> I'm still proud/not proud of my recursive monorepo Makefile.
[14:08:09] <andreyorst> especially when trying to make it so there are no unnecessury rebuilds in a non-c languages 
[14:08:18] <Para> It all started with this as root https://gist.github.com/esuomi/ee81ea8435da5c0ac6896ef3688e1e44
[14:09:15] <Para> stupidly simple and worked like a charm
[14:09:59] <Para> looking at my gists (most are private) apparently I've gathered a bunch of trash over the years. Like, clever trash but still just trash.
[14:10:00] <leah2> i'm very late to the clojure party but i always felt leiningen was some complex thing and deps.edn did everything i wanted
[14:10:35] <Para> leah2: maybe that's why you enjoy it, you're not used to declarative build tools :)
[14:10:43] <Para> Which may end up being a pretty good thing for you.
[14:12:19] <leah2> but i also run away screaming if something asks me to use maven for something :p
[14:12:39] <Para> Maven is IMHO the best build tool there is. Hard assumption you use it through IDEA, of course.
[14:12:55] <leah2> well i use emacs :p
[14:13:11] <Para> The XML is verbose, but verbosity is really just simplicity. The _structure_ of XML might not be simple, but it is a separate problem, usually caused by bad design.
[14:14:35] <Para> and of course the XML is just a strawman, you can define Maven projects with, among others, YAML or even Clojure these days https://github.com/takari/polyglot-maven
[14:16:11] <leah2> i tried compiling some thing that had a jni and couldnt figure it out
[14:16:23] <Para> That's JNI's fault.
[14:16:28] <leah2> but maybe that was upstream's fault too
[14:16:41] <leah2> not sure it works outside of github actions :p
[14:16:56] <Para> I haven't followed the native side of things but afaik JNI isn't even the intended way to do native code anymore.
[14:17:47] <Para> Which of course doesn't really help, as people who had the vigor to figure out the hard stuff back in the day to produce such things as cglib and whatnot don't seem to have such motivation anymore and  there's reduced amount of people willing to jump in again.
[14:18:17] <Para> That's the one attribute I like about borkdude actually, he seems to have an encompassing idea and vision for the whole sci/clj-kondo/babashka etc. ecosystem he's building.
[14:18:25] <Para> Not just a single library but a mesh of useful tools.
[14:22:27] <leah2> well it was unix domain sockets for java, i think you need some C code somehow
[14:22:37] <leah2> but it's offtopic really :)
[14:22:38] <Para> oh that library
[14:22:44] <Para> I know it exactly because wth :D
[14:22:57] <Para> I've tried to make it even compile to no avail. Thankfully latest JDK has native socket support!
[14:23:12] <leah2> who could expect java in 2021 not to support POSIX 2001 features somehow
[14:23:41] <leah2> Para: also of SOCK_SEQPACKET?

[14:25:21] <Para> It works through the existing Socket abstraction which, quoting my low level C programmer friend, "is the best implementation of sockets in any language" :O)
[14:25:30] <Para> Whoops, potato nose. Fat fingers.
[14:25:38] <leah2> i think it only does SOCK_STREAM
[14:26:56] <Para> I guess I should know more about unix sockets to be able to answer any better than that :) I'll take your word on it.
[14:27:31] <leah2> it's a bit of a niche feature admittedly :p
[14:27:46] <leah2> anyway, this other library implements it, i just need to wait for a release :p
[15:11:50] <wink> leah2: I guess it also highly depends on which tools you used in the past or just before that. I liked leiningen because it just worked and exhibited none of the problems I was used to see, back then. but it was actually 10 years ago, give or take a month
[15:12:13] <leah2> as said, i use clojure since this year essentially
[15:12:28] <wink> and I have no clue how old/young deps.edn is. I guess 2-3?
[15:12:44] <leah2> i think a bit older
[15:13:34] <Para> Lein's commandline options are also strictly within the rot13 set.
[15:13:39] <Para> Which makes it very easy to use.
[15:14:07] <wink> leah2: and yes, I read that. but retrospectively I still think I was fighting with composer and maven in horribly convoluted projects just before that and so it looked extra nice
[15:14:32] <wink> ha, nope. it was pre-composer.
[15:15:46] <wink> Para: the problem is usually weird stuff with profiles. there are hardly any people who can just answer a question about that
[15:18:31] <Para> wink: Maven profiles? Yeah, I can see the issue, it's one of those features where one really has to understand what they're doing :)
[15:19:53] <wink> Para: no, lein profiles. most people who have a question are doing things there I've never even heard about
[15:22:34] <Para> oh those
[15:22:43] <Para> Well, I don't really use them beyond dev/test profiles :)
[15:22:55] <wink> same
[15:23:06] <Para> One misunderstanding seems to be that people think they're on/off instead of additive/substractive.
[15:23:21] <wink> yeah
[15:24:17] <wink> but obviously I'm biased but I found the whole build tool discussion in clojure pretty uneventful over the years. in other ecosystems there's such a huge kerfuffle and everyone fighting over big changes and replacing the tools
[15:24:50] <leah2> well clojure has like 3 major tools?
[15:25:05] <wink> yeah but boot has been mentioned even less than it used to
[15:25:18] <wink> and looking at lein contributions... not a lot
[15:26:31] <wink> just curious why it feels a lot calmer than e.g. with npm and cargo for example.
