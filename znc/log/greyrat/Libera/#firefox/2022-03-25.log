[16:39:01] <Tazy> Hi all, when I do a clear all history it doesn't seem to go and update the sessionstore.jzmol4 file in the sense that it deletes the entries from the object, the entry history still stays there, is there a way to prune this? 
[16:39:24] <Tazy> Or do I need to write my own tool, to parse the json, and go and prune the entries? 
[16:44:54] <Tazy> Or do I need to do a refresh?
[16:45:47] <Cork> Tazy: the history in that file is the back list for open tabs, it isn't really considered history in the celar history sense
[16:46:13] <Tazy> Okay but that file of mine has grown to like 28mb, and causes firefox to crash on startup 
[16:46:19] <Tazy> so I have to prune the file. 
[16:46:27] <Tazy> So how do I get the tab history erased?

[20:55:16] <jaybeers> Is there a way to prevent the situation that results in the message "Restart to Keep Using Firefox -- An update to Firefox started in the background.  You'll need to restart to finish the update.  Your windows and tabs will be quickly restored, but private ones will not."
[20:55:28] *** Joins: acidsys (~LSD@2a03:4000:55:d20::3)
[20:57:39] <jaybeers> Like, I understand that updates are important, but it just seizes everything up with no warning.  Today, for example, it happened in the middle of a series of SAML auth redirections.  I'd really hate to have it happen in the middle of a purchase transaction or while I'm taking a test online or something.
[20:58:28] <jaybeers> Especially if I were doing it in a private window, since apparently it just nukes those (that doesn't personally affect me since I use a temporary container extension rather than the bespoke "Private Browsing", though)

[21:09:45] <jaybeers> It's whatever leads to displaying this page: https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/base/content/aboutRestartRequired.xhtml
[21:11:48] <ede> jaybeers: get rid of autoupdates if possible, the info that a new release is available really should be enough.
[21:12:58] <jaybeers> That's fine with me; as far as I know it should only be updating when I update the package (I'm on Kubuntu using the package from APT, suppose I should have mentioned that)
[21:14:09] <jaybeers> wait, is it just a matter of setting `app.update.auto` to false in about:config?  I swear I looked in here before for something related but maybe I just assumed I did
[21:16:15] <ede> does kubuntu still use the .deb version? some ubuntu seems to have switched to Snap
[21:17:38] <jaybeers> Yeah, it's .deb packages
[21:19:30] <jaybeers> ugh yeah I hope distros don't start going full Snap/AppImage/etc.  I mean, I love the idea behind that tech, but it's like Python virtualenv, or containerizing...great if you stay on top of updates but it opens the door to never updating dependencies
[21:20:22] <jaybeers> Even if you stay on top of updates it's still a bunch of extra disk space used for duplication, but with storage as cheap as it is these days maybe that's not such a big deal.  640TB ought to be enough for anybody, right?  :)
[21:21:02] <ede> for the moment it should :)
[21:22:03] <ede> app.update.auto is true for me btw, how the heck does it install it linux when it doesn't have write access?
[21:22:18] <jaybeers> that's what I'm sayin'!
[21:22:28] <Caspy7[m]> jaybeers: this is a consequence of your package manager updating Firefox while it's open. You can blame your distro for doing it wrong
[21:22:29] <ede> can't even remember if i get notofications during startup, hm
[21:22:41] <jaybeers> my assumption is either that a) it's fibbing, or b) it's doing some shenanigans in ~/.mozilla
[21:23:02] <ede> ah! another thing not happening without my written consent ;)
[21:23:26] <Caspy7[m]> install the version of fx from mozilla.org and it will update *itself* and you don't have to worry about your distro botching things
[21:24:06] <ede> i have apt-get update && apt-get upgrade available in the history, something i could just run even right after waking up
[21:24:56] <ede> i REALLY hope Kubuntu doesn't do weird things in $HOME
[21:27:52] <jaybeers> I mean, I'll blame whomever I need to blame, I'm not here to say someone's a bad person.  I just want to get to the bottom of it  :)  That's an interesting angle about automatic package updates, lemme have a look around and see if maybe that's it
[21:35:50] <jaybeers> aha!  You're right Caspy7[m], it _is_ a background package update.  I didn't really think it could be that 'cause I never made a specific cron job to do a dist-upgrade or anything, but I just went hunting and totally forgot that I installed the "unattended-upgrades" package back when I set this install up.  Sure enough, it's showing a Firefox upgrade from early this morning.
[21:36:00] <jaybeers> Mystery solved, thanks!
[21:36:15] <Caspy7[m]> sure
[21:46:07] <jaybeers> y'know, that's an interesting idea for a package manager; have an arbitrary command (presumably it'd be a shell script folded into the package metadata) that the package tool (apt, yum, etc.) can run and if it returns non-zero, don't proceed with the update
[21:47:38] <jaybeers> that's probably be helpful for any package that has a) a long-running process that b) can't necessarily be shut down gracefully.
[21:51:16] <`St0ner> what would cause tabs to constantly have the hourglass and never load? i have a few hundred tabs open but only a few dozen are actually activated and loaded, the rest are placeholders

[21:55:47] <Caspy7[m]> jaybeers: as I understand other package managers are able to manage updating Firefox without breaking it in this way. Maybe best to look at what they're doing.
[21:58:42] <jaybeers> I'm not sure how, unless the package manager is doing a separate code path for just Firefox package updates.  Then again, I've been wrong once today already so who knows.  :)  I do know that whenever I do a regular (interactive) dist-upgrade, the Firefox package prints a message "Please restart any running Firefoxes or you may experience problems"
[21:59:03] <Timvde> Caspy7[m]: which package manager?
[21:59:45] <jaybeers> (it prints that message regardless of whether or not there _were_ any running Firefoxes, FWIW)
[21:59:59] <Caspy7[m]> I don't remember specifics. I'm not on linux and didn't memorize, but I'm fairly sure I know that some have no issue
