[11:22:21] <markuskj> you greedy fool. should have learned already to never upgrade
[11:22:51] <Renderwww> at least the bios I could easily roll back

[12:40:09] <Renderwww> or maybe I forgot to toggle something in the bios that makes everything work

[14:23:30] <Carbonflux> its been my experience that Asus uses good quality parts.
[14:24:13] <Carbonflux> all my Asus stuff lasts a long time
[14:24:34] <Carbonflux> i was told once, don't know if its true, but that they mostly Japanese parts.
[14:24:49] * Carbonflux shrugs
[14:26:36] <Raziel> yeah, asus generally makes good stuff
[14:31:36] <Carbonflux> wondering why they named the new variant Omicron, its kind of menacing i guess, i was hoping for Sigma personally.
[14:32:55] <T`aZ> asus has shit linux support, and was very good 15y ago, now not so much
[14:40:45] <Raziel> there's very few things that asus themselves would need to make the support for. I guess their... RGB control shit? v:
[14:41:16] <Raziel> cause most shit is third-party anyway
[14:43:45] <Carbonflux> network drivers perhaps
[14:44:00] <T`aZ> last time was sata/"raid" controller
[14:44:21] <Raziel> Carbonflux, sure, but asus themselves doesn't make any nics. it's all intel/realtek/whoeverthefuck
[14:44:24] <T`aZ> garbage via chipset rebranded under their own name or something
[14:45:22] <Raziel> yeah some of those rebranded drivers or collections or control centers or such are just, well, shit
[14:45:37] <Raziel> I've never installed them after wiping asus laptops. and they've worked fine without em. v:
[14:45:47] <T`aZ> from a premium price product, this is simply not acceptable
[14:47:33] <Raziel> I agree in theory, but in practice it's the same with every big manufacturer so it's kinda eh
[14:49:35] <T`aZ> correct, my point was indeed more regarding the price/value
[14:51:31] <Raziel> I guess in this specific case, given only those two models, it's hard to talk about value. what I usually do when looking for laptops is lock in some specific hardware I want in the filters and see the prices v:
[14:52:06] <Raziel> asus is frequently very high up there when I do that, as far as lower prices for the same hardware as others
[14:53:49] <Juliu> Hi nerds
[14:53:54] <Raziel> hello nerd
[14:54:11] <Juliu> :)
[14:55:57] <Carbonflux> ya, i do the same, have a hardware spec and look for the best deal within that range.
