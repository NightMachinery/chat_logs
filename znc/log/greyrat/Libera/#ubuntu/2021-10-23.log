[00:29:05] <ouzel8___> sarnold, oqra, Alright, I think I have solved the problem. It seems somewhere around the docker snap revision 796 broke on my system. I have read some forum threads/issues relating to similar problems. But, in my case, I removed/forgot the docker snap, then reinstalled, no worries now. I was not concerned about losing data, so this was a shortcut for me, but, I have read there are other solutions to fixing this problem.
[00:29:41] <sarnold> ouzel8___: I'm glad it didn't cost you any data but that's frustrating all the same :( thanks for reporting back the success :)

[06:27:49] <kremat0r> hello guys, i installed previously xubuntu 20.04 succesfully and im happy with that but for some programs i want to install windows, i just installed win10AME everything in UEFI
[06:28:25] <kremat0r> obviously, installing windows erased the bootloader, currently im in xubuntu live session so, how can i reinstall the boot loader ?

[09:24:55] <Bashing-om> webchat56: You are at the right place to seek help, but a bad time. At this time most people are asleep.
[09:25:04] <alkisg> webchat56: create a live usb stick, boot with it, and see if everything works from there. If not, then you have hardware issues, not software issues
[09:25:10] <alkisg> The live usb stick will also help you in recovering your grub
[09:25:10] <okner> What you typed is a bit confusing. But often the boot loader gets messed up when people reformat the linux partition, or try to remove it. I think the boot loader fails to allow you to select windows when it detects the linux partition is no longer installed. You normally just re-install linux, or use windows installer/rescue disc/drive to repair the original windows partition.
[09:26:08] <webchat56> thank you

[09:31:34] <TJ-> webchat56: "pc wont boot in to win 7 . unless press f11" <-- that sounds to me like the PC's motherboard firmware (UEFI) has had it's boot menu entries erased. I presume F11 brings up a manual boot device selection?
[09:31:40] <webchat56> would takeing out battery in mother board get rid of bios stuff for linux?

[09:32:33] <webchat56> yes pressing f11 get to a boot choice lots of options
[09:32:51] <webchat56> even if the hdd is removed
[09:33:00] <webchat56> win 7 is on ssd
[09:33:07] <TJ-> webchat56: "usb drives are 32 gig , now they say 3.megs" <-- and that is a known symptom of fake/corrupted USB flash storage devices when their internal firmware gets corrupted. Often caused by overheating due to continuous reads and/or  writes
[09:34:05] <webchat56> ok usb drives are trash i can acept that , even one is less than ayear old
[09:34:13] <TJ-> webchat56: the 'F11 problem' can be solved by having the operating system reinstall it's boot menu entry. I can't tell you how that is done form Windows though. If it were being done from Linux we'd simply use the Linux "efibootmgr" tool

[09:45:05] <SupremeKai> Hello! I'm using ubuntu 20.04 and in the file explorer, as an example, if I change the name of a folder called, let's say, Zeus to _Zeus, upon renaming it and ordering the folders BY name the folder _Zeus does not go to the 1st position as I expected ('cause it has a dash before the _ and I would expect to show up before a folder called Adene for example)
[09:45:43] <SupremeKai> Upon using windows or even in google drive (web) if I change the name of a certain folder Zeus to _Zeus, it will be the first folder when ordering the folders by name
[09:46:20] <alkisg> SupremeKai: that's part of "language based sorting". Compare these two commands:
[09:46:22] <alkisg> printf "a\n_a\nb\n_b\n" | sort
[09:46:27] <alkisg> printf "a\n_a\nb\n_b\n" | LANG=C sort

[10:00:33] <alkisg> SupremeKai: that's completely NOT what I was saying though :)
[10:00:42] <alkisg> If you have ubuntu gnome, you already have "nautilus"
[10:00:48] <alkisg> Which is its version of "caja"
[10:01:03] <TJ-> Rumen: most likely the device has got confused and won't initialise, but keeps resetting

[10:28:45] <TJ-> webchat57: My guess right now is there is the remains of a BIOS-boot mode GRUB bootstrap code in sector 0 (MBR), and there is also some UEFI boot-loader(s) in a FAT32 EFI system Partition

[10:30:38] <TJ-> webchat57: if the disk has a GPT disk label then there may also be a small partition "BIOS Boot Partition" with GRUB's core image in it. That is expected when the disk uses GPT but boots in BIOS mode
[10:31:19] <rk4> i don't think you'll be getting security updates for win7 anymore, which is a rather important detail ;(
[10:31:28] <TJ-> webchat57: no, Linux did not break those thumb drives. Thumb drives fail due to poor manufacture or being cheap fakes. Many of us have suffered that, even with well-known brands.

[18:18:45] <ravage> dont think so
[18:18:47] <tomreyn> lektor: i think the only reason why apt is not wanting to install this driver is because you have the other driver series package installed
[18:18:49] <punkgeek> Sometimes, my laptop's fan runs at the maximum speed for no reason, and I should restart it to solve. Here is the sensor command output, which shows all temperatures are ok. https://paste.ofcode.org/UsNmrk2S5ykXJWPaHfmxR5

[18:32:21] <tomreyn> the easiest way to do so is probably using ubuntu-drivers
