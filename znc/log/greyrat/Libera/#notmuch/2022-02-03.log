[01:34:12] <drvink> what might be the issue?

[18:42:47] <inwit> Yummy, bremner! Thanks for the work on undo! :)
[18:43:43] <inwit> However, it's the first time I apply a patch, and there's surely something I did wrong. I compiled, installed and restarted emacs. And I still can't call notmuch-tag-undo, it's not even found with C-h f
[18:44:21] <bremner> inwit: I guess it's a matter of getting the load path correct. Can you try the script ./devel/try-emacs-mua ?
[18:53:20] <inwit> bremner: yeah, with that it works.
[18:53:35] <inwit> But shouldn't the executable that I installed after compiling work too?
[18:53:52] <inwit> Or there's more things to be done to install the emacs part?
[18:54:01] <bremner> yeah.
[18:54:59] <bremner> if you run "make elpa", you should get a notmuch-emacs-0.35.tar that you can install from within emacs.
[18:55:11] <bremner> Or make debian-snapshot if on debian/ubuntu.
[18:56:07] <inwit> Oh, I see! Thanks!
[18:56:38] <inwit> Surely it's too specific, but this is not explained in the INSTALL file.
[18:58:17] <bremner> hmm. Yeah, I guess probably the bindings need extra work to install too.
[18:58:49] <bremner> actually, make install does install the emacs, but maybe not in a  place your emacs looks by default?
[19:00:24] <bremner> I guess emacs looks in /usr first, and you are installing into /usr/local?
[19:00:32] *** Joins: rgrinberg (~textual@2806:101e:7:6bed:3054:7040:b02f:2be9)
[19:17:52] <inwit> I am, indeed. I could just `mv notmuch-emacs-mua` from /usr/local/bin to /usr/bin, right?
[19:18:20] <bremner> no, it's more more the .el / .elc files
[19:18:35] <inwit> Ok. I'll look into the "make elpa" procedure.
[19:18:55] <inwit> Thanks again!
[19:19:33] <bremner> sure

[19:54:13] <inwit> bremner: I managed to properly install it. It had to do with the fact that I'm (still) using spacemacs.
[19:54:56] <bremner> ah. Yeah, don't know much about that. Hopefully the undo key rebinding trick works there?
[19:55:21] <inwit> Yes it does! :)
[19:55:27] <inwit> However, the fact that notmuch-tag-history is buffer-local prevents me from using it in my repeat-tag function. I'd need a global tagging history.
[19:56:13] <bremner> hmm. Well, maybe we can discuss that on the list. I don't _think_ global history is right for undo, but I haven't really used it a lot.
[19:59:29] <inwit> It probably isn't, no. But maybe I can devise a way to accumulate local histories in a single place.
[20:01:26] <bremner> I guess it would depend how big that gets if we want to make it a standard feature. Pushing to two lists should be not much slower than pushing to one.
[20:01:57] <inwit> In fact, for repeat-tag I'd just need the last one :)
[20:02:17] <bremner> true
[20:02:58] <inwit> So, a global store for the last tags change. This is what I tried in my patch.
[20:03:10] <inwit> Although I stored everything, in fact.
[20:04:21] <bremner> hmm. Well, convince people that this is a useful feature to upstream I guess. I find the predefined tagging shortcuts (k ...) mostly work for what I need
[20:08:20] <inwit> I'll give it a try. The patch didn't get much attention. But anyway, it's not important at all. I'm just learning to scratch my itch, as has been said before... ;)
[20:09:12] <bremner> well, the patch inspired me to do the undo stuff, so not a complete waste :)

[22:43:47] <seanw> bremner: on my relatively underpowered cloud VM, nmbug frequently crashes with BrokenPipe.  I haven't dug deeply but I guess notmuch is crashing.  but I don't think it could be running out of memory as normal notmuch from within emacs is fine.  any initial thoughts?
[22:44:31] <bremner> seanw: we might be being lazy with python and slurping too much in to memory
[22:44:50] <bremner> although that would give different symptoms, you'd think
[22:46:32] <seanw> hrmhrm
[22:46:37] <seanw> indeed
[22:53:51] <bremner> nmbug basically just wraps notmuch dump and restore. Those both take a writelock, so if your VM has many concurrent notmuches running, maybe that's a problem?
[22:54:19] <bremner> that should manifest with a long wait before any crash though
[22:54:56] <seanw> there is such a wait
[22:55:06] <seanw> but there are not many notmuches running
[22:55:12] <seanw> can I override the timeout?
[22:55:36] <bremner> not easily, unfortunately
[22:55:46] <bremner> (it's hardcoded in Xapian iirc)
[22:58:15] <bremner> seanw: you can turn off blocking open completely, if you think that would help
[22:59:09] <seanw> bremner: let me try turning off my cronjob before running nmbug, for a few days, and see if it works
[22:59:19] <seanw> what exactly do you mean by turning off blocking open?
[22:59:38] <bremner> well, fail sooner, rather than wait for the other process to yield the lock
[22:59:48] <seanw> (the notmuch cronjob is only every half hour, so it is hard to be sure that is the problem)
[22:59:51] <bremner> or maybe you somehow have that already? that would be truly ancient xapien
[22:59:56] <seanw> it's bullseye
[23:00:07] <seanw> oh so the brokenpipe is because nmbug gives up waiting?
[23:00:18] <seanw> I thought you meant it was that it had the writelock too long and so another process killed it
[23:00:20] <bremner> well, not nmbug but the notmuch it shells out
[23:00:23] <seanw> right
[23:01:22] <seanw> thanks this is a very helpful starting point
[23:01:41] <seanw> maybe I just put "pkill -u $USER notmuch" at the front of the nmbug sync script
[23:01:49] <bremner> shiver
[23:02:01] <bremner> I mean, I guess it should be safe, in theory
[23:02:01] <seanw> I mean that's only sigint
