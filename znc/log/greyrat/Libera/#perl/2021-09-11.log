[00:08:41] <gordonfish> LeoNerd: Re: bloated software, etc; irc instant, slack in browser slow, etc.
[00:08:58] <gordonfish> I agree that something is seriously wrong with software in this age. IMHO, it no longer just horrifically unoptimized software, it's just negligent and sometimes even nafarious at this point. Partly to get people to keep upgrading hardware, to never feel like it's fast enough, etcm even in this day when GPU cards are mini lead blowers.
[00:09:11] <gordonfish> leaf*
[00:11:22] <gordonfish> { Re: <LeoNerd> Typing on a BBC micro was ~nearinstant and that had a CPU at a mere 4.7MHz } And I could say the exact same thing of my original PC-XT machine that I still have. Typing is instant. Hell, hitting PrtScn with a daisywheel printer back in the day felt instant, printing as I typed, similar to tele-types before that.
[00:12:55] <gordonfish> Windows is a big part of the problem and software written for that platform. Linux has always felt far, far leaner over all as much more is vetted and actually optmized compared to what comes out of redmond and cupertino..

[00:28:24] <mason> gordonfish: I think that if programmers considered carbon footprint sooner in their designs and more often through implementation things would be way better. My new favourite phrase, "meat is cheap, but carbon footprint is expensive"
[00:29:12] <mason> My daughter is learning Lisp and the Lisp book has a function to compute something, and rather than storing it as a local variable it computes it twice, because it's clearer to look at.
[00:30:29] <mason> And while maybe languages could support some sort of invisible memoization, it seems like it'd be better if programmers considered the labour involved in each operation and tagged it with a cost in their heads. I feel like I was lucky starting off long enough ago that there was a visible cost in time if I wrote bad code.
[00:31:08] <mason> I still wish I understood the cost of saying "my $foo" inside a loop as compared to outside of it.
[00:31:09] <huf> blaming programmers for this is missing the problem by miles
[00:31:25] <mason> huf: It's programmers or economics.
[00:31:28] <huf> economics.
[00:31:30] <mason> Or both.
[00:31:37] <huf> programmers write what their bosses let them
[00:31:49] <mason> I concede that too.
[00:31:55] <huf> and since you can sell absurdly slow shit that has a sadistic UI
[00:31:57] <huf> it's what we get
[00:32:12] <huf> users will just eat up whatever shit is dumped in their mouths
[00:32:15] <huf> they dont matter either
[00:32:19] <mason> heh
[00:33:24] <mason> My first programming gig taught me some of this. Write something, and it works. Realize the right way, the clean and efficient way to do it, come in the next morning, and my boss says "nope, that's done, now we're moving on".
[00:33:29] <gordonfish> huf: I get that programs, especially in larger companies or when dealing with large publishers, etc, don't alway have a lot of choice
[00:33:45] <gordonfish> programmers*
[00:33:50] <mason> This is where avocational hacking on free software wins. You can take the time to do it right and prioritize what you want.
[00:34:18] <huf> and yet
[00:34:45] <mason> huf: And yet, programmers are bad, so given their head they don't do the right thing, because of the environments and lack of constraints in which they learned.
[00:34:53] <huf> yes
[00:35:18] <huf> but you cant fix that with "oh free software"
[00:35:37] <huf> just as you cant fix death cults with mutual aid groups
[00:35:53] <mason> heh
[00:37:58] <huf> but yeah, ideally you'd have programmers develop all their shit on at least 10 year old hw
[00:38:10] <ehuelsmann[m]> Many of the programmers i work with have no idea of algorithm complexity such as time or storage requirements 
[00:38:16] <huf> and half of the testers would be blind

[00:39:03] <ehuelsmann[m]> Linearity versus exponentially
[00:39:11] <mason> huf: I think developing against an RPi3 would have the right effect. Still grossly overpowered enough that they could be very inefficient, but it'd be a step in the right direction.
[00:40:48] <huf> how do you run k8s on that?
[00:41:11] <mason> huf: I think podman would work
[00:42:01] <mason> huf: I see K8S as a potential vast win, not because it scales up, but because it can scale down when it needs to. It's like the Apple M1 chips having half their cores be low-power.
[00:48:51] <mst> k8s is great if you have the scale for k8s
[00:49:00] <mst> I'm not sure most places do
[00:49:23] <huf> i think we got to it because we wanted statically linked binaries
[00:49:27] <mst> burning a cpu core and a couple gig of ram per node just to make things run at all is a trade-off
[00:49:32] <huf> and this was the absolute stupidest way to do it
[00:49:36] <huf> with container images
[00:49:49] <huf> the other parts of containerization is nice though
[00:49:52] <huf> the isolation shit
[00:49:58] <mst> huf: all else aside google's distroless is cute
[00:50:38] <mst> "debian but then it deletes everything you didn't depend on to get an actually small container"
[00:50:56] <huf> that's still just statically linked binaries done stupid
[00:51:03] <huf> because our tools and languages are shit
[00:51:15] <huf> because we accepted dogshit slow stuff
[00:51:28] <mst> so when I rewrite App::StaticPerl but not schmorp you'll help test/

[00:51:37] <vanfanel64> You know that feeling you get when you see a snake crawl out of your toilet as you're about to sit your naked rear down?

[19:12:33] <ens> right now nothing like that has been considered. i'm starting with IO::Socket listening socket and that's it so far
[19:12:55] <thrig> so there ain't no terminal therefore nothing to get width/height of
[19:12:58] <LeoNerd> telnet specifically has ways to enquire it
[19:13:03] <LeoNerd> You'll have to talk the telnet protocol for it
[19:13:09] <LeoNerd> Or more likely, use a CPAN module that already does

[19:19:05] <ens> hrm, yeah i guess that would mean having to implement it myself
[19:20:02] <ens> basically i just want to get an incoming connection on a port which a telnet client connects to, and then send a string of lines down the socket at the width of the client so it doesn't line wrap.
[19:20:12] <LeoNerd> Hrm.. that is a shame. But still maybe you can build it atop IO::Socket::Telnet, possibly including sending them a patch to add the size stuff
[19:20:17] <LeoNerd> It's an ability it *ought* to have
[19:20:24] <LeoNerd> Yah
[19:21:46] <ens> there's got to be something off the shelf that can do this negotiation and just pass execution to some perlscript with the width and height as command line flags

[19:31:46] <hussam> Hello. I am trying to learn Perl from scratch today. What does $config>{input}{filename} mean? I understand input is an attribute of config. What would filename be?
[19:32:06] <LeoNerd> That's probably missing a hyphen - was it  $config->{input}...  ?
[19:33:05] <hussam> Thank you. I figured that part out already :) Now, what about {filename}?
[19:33:12] <thrig> input and filename are the same things
[19:33:21] <LeoNerd> They're just more keys of a nested hash...
[19:34:42] <hussam> so a value in the hash is actually a nested hash inside which one key has a value 'filename'?
[19:34:48] <LeoNerd> Seems so
[19:35:03] <hussam> Alright. Thanks.
[19:35:31] <quesker> how do I auth with Email::Sender?   or is there another module I should be using to send email?
