[00:03:14] <Joanna> The recent protest in Canada was probably organized with the same playbook as Ukraine and probably same backers but was never intended to be a success because they already control Canada. The Canada one was done for the pretext of declaring an emergency as well as trapping dissidents. In both cases the crowds had financial backing and probably wouldn’t have happened without it.
[00:36:54] <Decker> I liked the unidentified mercenary snipers :) 
[00:36:59] <Decker> just to really stir the pot
[00:39:28] <Decker> Joanna so - that canada cracdown went after the donator to the cause - and froze their accounts - so some lady who donated $25 couldn't buy gas, or groceries for her kid anymore... 
[00:59:34] <Joanna>  Decker Yea that’s pretty bad what they did luring gullible people and sacrificing them as they always do.
[01:01:00] <Joanna> The proper way for Canadians to rebel would be to take all their money out of banks and only work for cash
[01:01:33] <Decker> :) next time... and get around a new maximum withdrawal limit? (thinking the think ahead too?)
[01:01:59] <Decker> a run on the banks is what happend in 1920's:)  2020's...
[01:02:03] <Decker> something about history repeating?
[01:06:26] <Joanna> Eventually they want to make it impossible to use cash
[01:10:54] <Decker> wish bitcoin wasn't so... thermally expensive
[01:11:59] <jan6> bitcoin is trash anyway
[01:12:26] <Joanna> I don’t trust bitcoin
[01:12:37] <jan6> it's nearly impossible to mine unless you got some mining farm, *AND* it's explicitly VERY traceable
[01:12:47] <jan6> every single transaction is logged, FOREVER
[01:13:19] <jan6> you better not trust it
[01:13:22] <jan6> not because it's bad
[01:13:42] <jan6> just because it's more traceable than normal bank transfers, lol
[01:16:28] <jan6> there's a lot more coins though
[01:17:11] <jan6> I barely know anything tho, all I know is that monero is one of the few that don't publically log every single transaction onto the blockchain
[01:17:26] <jan6> and bitcoin is only good for trading
[01:21:27] <Decker> yup :) 
[01:22:19] <Decker> well no... it could be practical currency control democratically ; (even if coropriately cause they're the only ones who can afford the servers and will be > 51% themselves) ... but normal transactions I don't care about being traced so much
[01:22:27] <Decker> it's vain to think the CIA wants my search history
[01:22:35] <Decker> eerr NSA
[01:23:00] *** Joins: shibboleth (~shibbolet@user/shibboleth)
[01:28:37] <Joanna> The problem with digital currency and banking in general is that it makes it too easy to confiscate your property on a whim. It also makes it more possible to be cut off from you assets by mistake. I’ll never forget the time that I spent the weekend without food because  the magnetic stripe on my  card got worn out and the office to replace it was only open on weekdays.
[01:30:07] <shibboleth> Joanna, i was at a LAN-party in another part of the country first time it happened to me
[01:30:12] <shibboleth> bum-mer
[01:30:41] <shibboleth> been a cash-only business ever since
[01:31:30] <Joanna> It’s a good idea to assume things will go wrong..
[01:31:32] <shibboleth> also, if you really hate someone: cancel their card while they're on holiday aborad
[01:31:41] <shibboleth> well, block/freeze it
[01:31:47] <shibboleth> "you lost it"
[01:32:13] <Joanna> Don’t banks verify that sort of thing?
[01:32:53] <shibboleth> how? you know their name, address and you're calling from a payphone because... let's say you were mugged
[01:33:10] <Joanna> Banks can send new cards to foreign addresses
[01:33:55] <Joanna> You would have to know their banking info
[01:33:57] <shibboleth> one week to make it, receive it plus a few days/a week to forward it. holiday still fucked
[01:34:32] <Joanna> Do people still go on holidays abroad?
[01:34:54] <shibboleth> apparently so. still, just an evil shower-thought
[01:35:40] <Joanna> When I go abroad I buy foreign currency before going
[01:35:45] <shibboleth> anywho, since that LAN i've carried cash, occasionally use the card to withdraw more cash
[01:35:56] <Joanna> I don’t trust cards too much
[01:36:16] <shibboleth> especially the new nfc-enabled ones
[01:36:38] <Joanna> Some banks let you turn cards on and off if you lose and find it you can turn back on
[01:37:04] <shibboleth> you can wireless-ly extract the card UUID, transaction history, current balance, etc
[01:37:42] <shibboleth> essentially, a shopping mall can install a huge nfc antenna around their entry/exit, read out your UUID, charges, new balance
[01:38:02] <shibboleth> and correlate it with other locations/readouts
[01:38:35] <shibboleth> you could even use it to track movements
[01:38:59] <shibboleth> there's no difference between the tech used in your nfc card and ezpass
[01:39:45] <shibboleth> just the huge-ass antenna in the ezpass readers giving it extra range
[01:40:28] <Joanna> Can you use a way to block signal like metal screen?
[01:40:29] <shibboleth> congratulations, we invented a friggin wireless version of the magstripe, wohooo
[01:40:48] <shibboleth> yes, those "wallet guards" or whatever will do the trick
[01:41:47] <Joanna> The chip on bank cards can read balance?
[01:41:52] <Decker> a lot are pretty flimsy and really don't
[01:42:19] <shibboleth> the chip?
[01:42:39] <Joanna> Bank atm cards
[01:43:15] <shibboleth> it's an optional feature, mainly used to prevent overdrafts
[01:43:15] <Decker> don't think POS access terminals impelment ATM protocol?
[01:43:38] <Decker> they could I suppose
[01:43:51] <Decker> it's just a protocol and both devices can read such chips/stripes/..
[01:44:15] <shibboleth> the terminal powers the card by induction, sends a loader, charge/"signing request", the card signs the request
[01:45:08] <Decker> it's fast - faster than a magstrip head :)
[01:45:11] <shibboleth> depending on the implementation, balance may not be updated at POS, may be restricted to ATMs where the card is "plugged-in"
[01:45:33] <Decker> I just wave mine there too
[01:45:38] <shibboleth> but the card is more than happy to dole out your UUID and charges to anyone who asks
[01:45:53] <Joanna> Oh you mean those touch and go things
[01:46:08] <Decker> ya 
[01:46:17] <shibboleth> i punched a hole through mine, disabling the antenna. can't be powered through induction
[01:46:26] <Joanna> What a horrible idea someone gets your card and can go on spending spree?
[01:46:59] <Decker> PIN
[01:47:03] <shibboleth> afaik the pin is required for charges > 20 usd or something
[01:47:08] <Joanna> Where is the antenna?
[01:47:25] <Decker> it's a loop around the chip 
[01:47:28] <Decker> around the card
[01:47:31] <shibboleth> rectangular antenna along the circumference of the card
[01:47:47] <Decker> is it even that big?
[01:47:47] <Joanna> Hmm
[01:47:51] <shibboleth> has to be
[01:48:17] <Decker> well makes it easier to target another coil
[01:48:20] <shibboleth> you only have to break it at a single place, break the loop
[01:49:02] <Joanna> So when you punch a hole you see the wire in there?
[01:49:37] <shibboleth> find out who made the card, read out the nfc chip id and you'll find schematics
[01:50:00] <shibboleth> or, hold it up against a veeeeeeery bright light
[01:50:04] <Joanna> That’s interesting
[01:50:23] <Decker> they use a pretty diffuse plastic now though
[01:50:29] <shibboleth> maybe a stud-finder will work
[01:50:51] <Joanna> Are we talking about the visa logo atm check cards issued by banks ?
[01:50:57] <shibboleth> yes
[01:51:05] <shibboleth> or mc
[01:51:26] <Joanna> With the WiFi icon on them
[01:51:29] <shibboleth> on that note: mc are planning to require users to submit for a selfie at pos/terminals
[01:51:41] <shibboleth> the "waves", yes
[01:52:01] <Decker> https://imgur.com/a/k7vvS is one type
[01:52:20] <shibboleth> just look at the new terminals being rolled out, they have a friggin pin-sized camera above the display
[01:52:34] <Joanna> I think the enabling for contactless use is an opt in feature at the moment
[01:52:45] <shibboleth> Joanna, the chip is still there
[01:52:46] <Decker> it's the same chip
[01:53:05] <Decker> if the contacts get cruddy the other inductive reader can still work
[01:54:05] <shibboleth> doesn't matter if you only never enabled/use nfc, chip will still dole out its uuid and transaction history
[01:54:11] <shibboleth> you just can't use it to pay
[01:55:03] <shibboleth> ... for shit you prolly don't need anyway :P
[01:58:53] <Joanna> Does the transaction history include atm withdrawals or is it just transactions at stores?
[02:00:16] <shibboleth> hmmm, haven't checked. i've demoed this to a few acquaintances to scare them straight, lemme look at the dumps
[02:00:49] <Joanna> I only use card for atm
[02:01:53] <shibboleth> no even numbers, at least none of them had recently used it in an atm
[02:01:55] <Joanna> That’s pretty bad that the card is giving that information out with no login
[02:02:19] <shibboleth> but
[02:02:28] <Joanna> You could test it on your card next time you use atm
[02:02:54] <shibboleth> they have "transaction type: purchase".
[02:03:35] <shibboleth> so... likely atm withdrawals have their own type and are recorded
[02:03:50] <shibboleth> nah, fucked up the antenna
[02:04:28] <shibboleth> oh yeah, and the readouts include the full CC # and expiry date
[02:04:32] <shibboleth> just not the cv2
[02:05:05] <shibboleth> so, let the mall set up their antenna, sell the data and have data broker collate it with your online purchases
[02:06:21] <Joanna> Well I’m glad atm info isn’t in there
[02:06:32] <shibboleth> oh, it likely is
[02:06:47] <shibboleth> since there are specific transaction types
[02:06:56] <shibboleth> droid user?
[02:07:12] <Joanna> With the expiration date anyone can use your card online
[02:07:26] <shibboleth> https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.github.devnied.emvnfccard.pro <--- if you don't have the skills to do it yourself
[02:07:31] <shibboleth> yeah, but no cv2
[02:09:10] <Joanna> What is the scanning range usually?
[02:09:18] <shibboleth> depends on the reader
[02:09:30] <shibboleth> your phone? likely an inch or so
[02:09:40] <shibboleth> but again: ezpass
[02:11:02] <Joanna> How about passports? There was a lot of hype when those got the chip
[02:11:08] <shibboleth> indeed
[02:11:18] <shibboleth> you can read out the photo and other info
[02:11:35] <shibboleth> https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.tananaev.passportreader
[02:13:20] <Joanna> It’s getting harder and harder to have privacy
[02:13:29] <shibboleth> you think?
[02:14:06] <shibboleth> Joanna, try that application with your card, i'm curious re atm withdrawals
[02:14:41] <Joanna> Yet everytime some big crime happens the video tapes and cellphone data of everything nearby go missing:)
[02:14:53] <shibboleth> tapes?
[02:15:06] <shibboleth> what, the plane hitting the hexagon?
[02:15:20] <Joanna> Yea surveillance camera tapes just disappear
[02:15:43] <shibboleth> ppl actually using actual tapes are lucky to have a days retention
[02:16:05] <shibboleth> got robbed, press stop. otherwise each day is a new day
[02:16:06] <Joanna> All sorts of incidents. Like when they killed Diana also
[02:16:28] <shibboleth> in a tunnel in 19-bow-and-arrow?
[02:16:35] <shibboleth> yeah, dunno if there even were cams
[02:16:56] <Joanna> All the streets on the way had cameras
[02:17:00] <shibboleth> that being said: didn't she have dozens of paparazzi on their ass at the time?
[02:17:28] <Joanna> That’s the story
[02:18:04] <Joanna> But with all the tapes disappeared who knows
[02:18:35] <shibboleth> well, it'd be... "uncouth" to publish any of those pics, so..
[02:19:05] <Joanna> How about the blm riots when everyone there has a cell phone. They could have found out who did them easy
[02:19:36] <Joanna> Public camera footage
[02:19:43] <shibboleth> well, the rioters won't benefit from handing over any footage, so what do you expect?
[02:20:25] <Joanna> The cell phone providers for rioters would have info about them
[02:20:41] <shibboleth> public camera footage? private cctv, and if a shopkeeper sticks their neck out, giving out footage, whose store will get looted next?
[02:21:00] <Joanna> Like where the cellphone spends the night
[02:21:15] <shibboleth> ofc, but carrier-phase-tracking is an active measure
[02:21:23] <shibboleth> you can't do it retroactively
[02:21:35] <shibboleth> and the regular location data isn't thaaaaaaat accurate
[02:22:25] <Joanna> Cellular service providers have records of where the phone goes as well as phone number and who pays the bill don’t they ?
[02:22:43] <Joanna> And what other numbers it calls
[02:22:43] <shibboleth> yes, but it isn't accurate down to the inch
[02:23:31] <shibboleth> you think ATT wanna stick their necks out and get slamme for "systemic racism"?
[02:24:19] <Joanna> If the government told them hand over your data we are investigating crimes they would
[02:25:03] <shibboleth> because when poor people burn down their own neighborhood it's because of systemic racism and oppression. everyone knows that
[02:25:31] <Joanna> Blm had white organizers
[02:25:38] <shibboleth> seen the movie/documentary LA92?
[02:25:44] <shibboleth> do see it
[02:25:59] <Joanna> Is that about la riots ?
[02:26:03] <shibboleth> yes
[02:26:23] <Joanna> I lived in la when they happened
[02:26:32] <shibboleth> well.. there you go
[02:26:54] <shibboleth> notice how they burned down everything but the post office? you know, otherwise they wouldn't be able to... "get their mail"?
[02:26:59] <Joanna> They burned down a lot of stuff
[02:27:39] <shibboleth> maxine waters standing outside speaking on a megaphone?
[02:28:03] <Joanna> They looted and burned things and the post office doesn’t have goodies to loot really
[02:28:32] <shibboleth> yeah, but you get... "mail" at the post office
[02:29:10] <Joanna> I believe that it was all whipping up the useful idiots into a frenzy using the news media
[02:29:29] <shibboleth> using the news media?
[02:30:11] <shibboleth> the news media covering the rioters, shooting/throwing stones/shit at non-black/latino drivers
[02:30:26] <shibboleth> pulling white truck-drivers out of their truck, bashing their head in
[02:30:40] <Joanna> The mail at post office is another issue. There was a problem of attacking mail carriers in la and mail couldn’t be delivered to homes in some neighborhoods
[02:30:55] <shibboleth> welfare check
[02:30:57] <shibboleth> "mail"
[02:30:58] <shibboleth> get it?
[02:31:32] <Joanna> Yea Reginald Denny? thing
[02:32:22] <Joanna> Well now welfare got done away with with Clinton’s welfare to work thing
[02:33:35] <Joanna> I understand what you are getting at but destroying all the grocery stores is just as bad. What good is money if you can’t buy food ?
[02:34:27] <Joanna> Do you remember last year when there was massive looting in South Africa?
[02:36:16] <shibboleth> "oh, no korean lady (latasha harlem (iirc)) wasn't locked up for life, shoot at asian drivers"
[02:36:36] <shibboleth> "loot stores operated by asians"
[02:37:14] <shibboleth> that backfired though, since korean immigrants had gone through mandatory military service
[02:38:02] <shibboleth> and so they knee their firearms and cqb tactics
[02:38:10] <shibboleth> knew
[02:38:23] <shibboleth> in south africa?
[02:39:02] <shibboleth> nah. can't say i've heard much about south africa since the... was there a soccer championship there like 10 years back?
[02:39:27] <shibboleth> neil blomkamp is from there. good movies
[02:39:37] <shibboleth> well, maybe not that last one, but
[02:44:23] <Joanna> Last year lots of looting and I think hatred of asians
[02:45:12] <shibboleth> by whom?
[02:45:13] <Joanna> It’s easy to generate a flash mob of useful idiots it’s kind of like owning a bot net
[02:46:07] <shibboleth> what, south african hating asians?
[02:46:16] <shibboleth> south africans?
[02:46:41] <Joanna> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_South_African_unrest
[02:46:59] <shibboleth> well, maybe something, something, china getting their dick in to sa
[02:47:51] <shibboleth> like with the congo
[02:48:19] <shibboleth> oh, they were protesting against zuma being indicted?
[02:48:21] <shibboleth> holy...
[02:49:29] <shibboleth> also, covid effect, the economy. not gonna pretend i understand it all by skimming through the wiki
[02:50:21] <Joanna> That’s kind of a biased article being Wikipedia but you get the idea
[02:51:03] <Joanna> Isn’t amazing how people have the energy to riot as they are all dying of Covid :)
[02:51:11] <shibboleth> seen the floyd video? i had avoided looking at it for the longest time, something something, macabre, snuff-video
[02:52:03] <shibboleth> but eh... the media coverage doesn't appear to have been... "fair and balanced"
[02:54:37] <shibboleth> yes, he was killed, and no, that shouldn't happen. but eh... i'm not sure i'd survive resisting arrest for that long, either
[02:56:29] <shibboleth> i mention it re... "useful idiots"/flashmobs
[02:57:15] <Joanna> I never watched the actual video but nobody seems to address why the people stood there and let the cop kill the guy if that indeed is what happened. Also the Floyd guy was a bad choice of a black person to rally behind for being mistreated. There are Black people who aren’t criminals that get mistreated all the time and nobody cares.
[02:57:16] <shibboleth> people having gotten stir crazy being locked up for several months, finally some pretense to go out, act out
[02:57:23] <shibboleth> look at it
[02:57:46] <shibboleth> there's more to what actually happened than... you know
[02:58:54] <Joanna> They were steered by the media into acting stupid as they always are. It’s like a zombie army.
[02:59:58] <shibboleth> he drove to a bodega/mart under the influence (re autopsy tox rep), paid with funny money, went back to his car (and was presumably about to yet again drive under the influence)
[03:00:06] <Joanna> They were filling the roads and trying to rob trucks and the terrified drivers were driving over them to escape. It looked like something straight out of a zombie apocalypse movie..
[03:00:26] <shibboleth> cops came, spent well over five minutes trying to get him into the squad car, he refused, fought/resisted
[03:00:42] <shibboleth> *then* chauvin pulled the... "chauvin-maneuver"
[03:01:05] <Joanna> He also worked at same nightclub as the cop who killed ? Him. Could they know eachother was it staged ?
[03:01:28] <shibboleth> three (well, two) cops had *tried*  and failed at getting him into the squad-car for about five minutes
[03:02:36] <Joanna> Yea the whole thing makes no sense. I blame the media for facilitating the riots
[03:02:54] <shibboleth> "no, i'm claustrophobic", "don't touch me, i have covid"
[03:04:20] <Joanna> Isn’t amazing how people hide in their homes by the billions without hesitation but suddenly come out to riot for awhile and then suddenly disappear as quickly as they appeared awaiting for the next instructions from their fleshbot herders
[03:04:44] <shibboleth> but eh... i have mixed feelings armchair-quarterbacking "what happened"
[03:05:03] <shibboleth> yes, he was killed. no, that shouldn't happen
[03:08:23] <shibboleth> Joanna, i'm not surprised. i called it in 2008 when fakebook was taking off
[03:08:42] <Joanna> We can’t really know if anything in news is true. It could be staged. Unless we know him personally and saw his corpse we really don’t know if he died or not.
[03:09:47] <shibboleth> yeah, maybe he's at a farm upstate, with tupac and elvis
[03:10:06] <Joanna> And Epstein
[03:10:12] <shibboleth> indeed
[03:10:42] <Joanna> In any case he was a distraction and Black people are probably worse off after the riots
[03:11:06] <shibboleth> but the selfies were epic
[03:12:43] <Joanna> Most people are gullible and when bad people control them bad things happen
[03:14:18] <shibboleth> good people do bad things. bad people do things that are supposedly good for others
[03:15:17] <Joanna> Indeed
[03:15:55] <Joanna> People always believe they are doing the best possible thing no matter what
