[00:47:07] <HyP3r> Hey guys, I have a stupid problem here and I don't know how to go about it: I have updated my Debian 10 to Debian 11 and in the process updated my PVE (Proxmox VE). And since then I have the problem that two of my seven VMs hang after a few hours or days. Hanging means that they can no longer be pinged and are no longer accessible via the PVE console. What is very interesting now is that it is exactly the
[00:47:13] <HyP3r> two VMs that use USB passthrough. Anyway, I haven't found anything about this effect in any log on my system (journalctl, dmesg, ...). But I can say relatively exactly when it always happens because my monitoring system notices that they go offline. What should I do now?

However, since some of our software is still only certified for RHEL6, they don't want to upgrade all the servers... and they haven't decided how many to actually upgrade... so we're in limbo for a bit.

[13:39:29] <zetaE> question
[13:39:50] <zetaE> for a linux install, is it better to turn on UEFI sata/nvme RAID mode?
[13:40:07] <Benzi-Junior> hey, is there some clever way to manipulate XWindows from the command line
[13:40:47] <lopid> manipulate how?
[13:41:01] <Elw3> Xdotool maybe?
[13:41:49] <Benzi-Junior> i.e. I'm trying to fill in a form that nm-applet pops up when I activate a globalprotect vpn

[14:40:14] <djph> cadmio: as in you have a 16/32/64-bit address bus?
[14:40:42] <MrElendig> all the cool people have 40 or 48bit address bus
[14:40:50] <djph> cadmio: tells you how much you can address.
[14:41:16] <cadmio> I know data can be read in and out from the chip as eight bits at a time
[14:41:25] <MrElendig> (most x86 implementations using 48bit)
[14:41:38] <djph> cadmio: wrong.
[14:42:05] <MrElendig> also fun: modern x86 machines doesn't really have an address bus in the first place
[14:43:02] <djph> I stopped paying attention to addressing in x86 a very long time ago :|  addressing in z80 is more fun anyway :)
[14:43:02] <cadmio> the text I'm reading says that it can access 64Kb of memory

[14:46:56] <cadmio> what's the meaning of being a 16-bit address bus CPU?
[14:48:06] <djph> It means it has 16 positions to work with -- 0x0000 to 0xFFFF , and each of those 65,536 addresses can point to one byte in RAM

[23:37:54] <mrfb> that's the better advise

[23:45:32] <fizzizist1> This is a really random curiosity question, but, does ext4 have some kind of b-tree index for every folder of the filesystem? Like when i specify a file in a command, is it looking it up in an index? or is it sequentially scanning the entire directory?
