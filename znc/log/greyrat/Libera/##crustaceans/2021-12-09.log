[00:27:46] <dimadima> my mom was talking about Succession yesterday
[00:27:54] <dimadima> everyone's watching Succession
[00:29:10] <manicennui> Did she threaten to cut you out of the will?
[00:29:30] <dimadima> lol
[00:29:49] <manicennui> That stuff is always so weird to me.
[00:30:03] <dimadima> getting cut out of wills?
[00:30:07] <manicennui> Like when assholes cut their kids out of their wills for being gay or doing something else they don't like.
[00:30:19] <manicennui> I guess maybe because I don't expect to be in anyone's will.
[00:30:33] <manicennui> Maybe my grandmother's, but it won't be millions of dollars, and I'm not sitting around waiting for it.
[00:30:48] <manicennui> I just can't understand being so dependent on someone's will.
[00:32:50] <dimadima> i like when you're in someone's will by surprise
[00:32:52] <dimadima> like a rich old uncle
[00:32:59] <dimadima> and suddenly you get an unexpected windfall
[00:33:08] <dimadima> that's never happened to me
[00:33:09] <manicennui> I have never had that happen and don't expect to.
[00:33:19] <manicennui> My father's siblings are pretty well off, but not super rich.
[00:33:24] <dimadima> happnes all the time in old movies
[00:33:27] <manicennui> Yeah.
[00:33:36] <manicennui> Especially if they have to do something in order to get it.
[00:33:37] <dimadima> or old time radio
[00:33:52] <dimadima> i get emails from people in west africa all the time about this
[00:33:58] <dimadima> princes etc
[00:33:59] <Brekkjern> I might not have to take a booster shot for covid anytime soon. Not sure if that's a positive or not...
[00:34:10] <dimadima> i have to go do that
[00:34:27] <manicennui> My doctor told me to get a booster when I can, but what does he know?
[00:34:28] <dimadima> manicennui: your grandmother is alive?
[00:34:32] <manicennui> He probably didn't check facebook.
[00:34:36] <manicennui> dimadima: Yes.
[00:34:43] <dimadima> you can't be that old lol
[00:35:06] <dimadima> unless your grandmother had your mother had you when they were like 14
[00:35:25] <manicennui> My Jewish grandparents had/have super genes.
[00:35:34] <dimadima> the old jews
[00:35:40] <manicennui> Grandfather just passed away this year at 96.
[00:35:47] <dimadima> if they don't die from jewish cancers, they live forever
[00:35:56] <dimadima> my condolences
[00:36:05] <manicennui> Think my grandmother is about 90.
[00:36:11] <dimadima> that's not so old
[00:36:20] <dimadima> how's she doing
[00:36:37] <manicennui> Still mostly with it. Some physical problems.
[00:36:42] <dimadima> i guess not too bad cause you're not waiting for the will
[00:36:54] <manicennui> I wouldn't wait for the will even if she were.
[00:36:59] <dimadima> got to kill the competition, too
[00:37:01] *** Joins: danderson (~dave@tailscale/danderson)
[00:37:03] <manicennui> I don't know whether I'll receive anything and don't care.
[00:37:48] <dimadima> boring
[00:39:21] <dimadima> i need my booster
[00:39:34] <Brekkjern> I need my nose to start working again :(
[00:39:41] <dimadima> did you get covid?
[00:39:46] <Brekkjern> Maybe
[00:39:51] <Brekkjern> Got tested today
[00:40:01] <dimadima> did you go to this conference/
[00:40:03] <Brekkjern> Get the results tomorrow or friday I think
[00:40:07] <Brekkjern> Yeah
[00:40:10] <dimadima> wow man
[00:40:13] <manicennui> Do you have a plan of succession for buttsbot?
[00:40:17] <Brekkjern> lol
[00:40:17] <dimadima> feeling okay?
[00:40:32] <Brekkjern> Eh. It's just a "flu"
[00:40:51] <dimadima> welp
[00:40:52] <Brekkjern> It sucks, but I've already had two shots and I'm still "young" so
[00:41:02] <dimadima> why sucks?
[00:41:11] <dimadima> so far so good?
[00:41:13] <Brekkjern> Yeah
[00:41:28] <Brekkjern> Just a fever, sore throat and stuffy nose
[00:41:35] <dimadima> my anti-vax covid-isnt-real brother in law is coming tomorrow and not sure what to do
[00:41:49] <manicennui> Avoid him.
[00:41:49] <dimadima> Brekkjern: acetamenophen working for the fever?
[00:41:51] <Brekkjern> And I can feel that my lungs are worse than they normally are.
[00:41:57] <dimadima> paracematol?
[00:42:03] <manicennui> What are the chances that he is a tolerable person otherwise?
[00:42:05] <dimadima> Brekkjern: wow crap
[00:42:13] <Brekkjern> dimadima: The fever is mild, so eh
[00:42:20] <dimadima> manicennui: he's okay he's just a dumb PoS in this regard
[00:42:31] <dimadima> he's one of these guys who thnikgs everything is fake
[00:42:37] <dimadima> he's like an idle conspiracy theorist
[00:42:39] <Brekkjern> I had an ibuprofen earlier today and that helped a lot, but it's the airway symptoms that suck the most
[00:42:42] <dimadima> unlike the rest of my wifes family
[00:42:50] <manicennui> That sounds like someone I'd avoid.
[00:43:00] <dimadima> i've found paracematol helps my fevers a lot
[00:43:08] <Brekkjern> Yeah, it usually does
[00:43:16] <dimadima> " paracetamol"
[00:43:27] <dimadima> well shit
[00:43:31] <dimadima> fucking covid!
[00:43:34] <dimadima> unreal
[00:43:42] <Brekkjern> Eh. I'll be fine
[00:43:43] <dimadima> manicennui: not inviting him inide, right?
[00:43:48] <dimadima> inside*
[00:43:59] <dimadima> yeah you'll be fine but it sure does seem catchy
[00:44:05] <Brekkjern> Yeah
[00:44:12] <manicennui> I'm pretty good at just avoiding people all together.
[00:44:15] <manicennui> Life is too short.
[00:44:35] <Brekkjern> The "bonus" I get is that I don't have to take the exam on friday since I'm probably still sick that day
[00:44:37] <dimadima> too short for what
[00:44:46] <manicennui> Dealing with annoying people I don't have to.
[00:45:04] <dimadima> i'd love to not deal with him but my wife is depressed about the whole situation with her family
[00:45:05] <manicennui> Including annoying family members.
[00:45:17] <manicennui> Oh, you got one of those.
[00:45:18] <dimadima> namely that they are in another universe
[00:45:47] <manicennui> Yet another reason why I'll likely never get married.
[00:45:51] <Brekkjern> My sisters boyfriend doesn't see the point of the vaccine since he's young and all...
[00:46:37] <dimadima> well now that it doesn't really help you not get sick or transmit covid
[00:46:43] <dimadima> i don't get why people make a big deal out of it
[00:46:48] <Brekkjern> Yeah
[00:46:53] <dimadima> at this point i'd rather ppl wear masks
[00:47:01] <manicennui> It does help you not get sick...
[00:47:02] <dimadima> than get the vaccine, around me
[00:47:18] <dimadima> manicennui: it helps you not get hospitalized/die, i thought
[00:47:23] <bkero> Whew, bad hot takes on IRC today.
[00:47:27] <dimadima> at this point aren't the infection rates about the same?
[00:47:28] <manicennui> It helps you not get it in the first place.
[00:47:51] <dimadima> i thought pfizer was like... no net difference at this point
[00:47:59] <dimadima> but i could be wrong
[00:48:09] <dimadima> i'm getting a booster anyway
[00:48:18] <bkero> Uhh
[00:48:25] <dimadima> sup bkero
[00:48:29] <bkero> Not everything is Omicron now bud
[00:48:31] <dimadima> what are the bad hot takes
[00:48:36] <bkero> Vaccines still work.
[00:48:41] <bkero> Yours.
[00:48:45] <Brekkjern> The vaccines still prevent hospitalization
[00:48:49] <Brekkjern> Even without boosters
[00:48:54] <dimadima> that's what i said?
[00:49:07] <manicennui> "The rate of infection in unvaccinated people is five times the rate of infection in vaccinated people."
[00:49:11] <dimadima> < dimadima> manicennui: it helps you not get hospitalized/die, i thought
[00:49:20] <manicennui> https://www.nytimes.com/article/breakthrough-infections-covid-19-coronavirus.html
[00:49:55] <manicennui> "The Delta variant appears to have increased the risk of breakthrough infections to vaccinated people. At the start of the study, before Delta was dominant, unvaccinated people became infected 10 times as often as vaccinated people did. By the end of study period, when Delta accounted for almost 90 percent of infections, unvaccinated people were five times as likely to get infected as vaccinated people."
[00:50:13] <bkero> dimadima | well now that it doesn't really help you not  get sick or transmit covid
[00:50:26] <manicennui> Yeah, I don't know why he thinks that.
[00:50:29] <bkero> That is the bad hot take.
[00:51:32] <dimadima> so currently it's about 5x likely
[00:51:42] <dimadima> got to wonder how they normalize that to behavior
[00:51:57] <dimadima> unvaccinated people generally act like nothing is going on
[00:52:10] <dimadima> aka my brother in law, who asked us where is a good coffee shop for him to take some meetings tomorrow
[00:52:14] <dimadima> wht a fucking a sshole
[00:52:43] <dimadima> bkero: welp, good to be wrong. i'll say, i'm just generally really down on this covid situation
[00:53:03] <dimadima> how am i supposed to let this person near my child
[00:53:05] <dimadima> i don't know
[00:57:41] <manicennui> Oddly, my doctor didn't have covid vaccines available. Not sure whether they ever plan to make them available to normal doctors.
[00:58:11] <manicennui> He told me to just go to a pharmacy for a booster.
[00:58:19] <manicennui> Northwestern (the network he is a part of) handled the first two shots, but they aren't doing boosters.
[00:58:31] <manicennui> Northwestern is literally one of the best hospitals in the US.
[00:58:39] <Brekkjern> https://i.redd.it/42oxmoqihd481.jpg
[00:58:45] <manicennui> Kind of insane.
[00:59:17] <manicennui> I did get a flu shot.
[00:59:30] <dimadima> Even so, many experts believe the risk of getting infected from a vaccinated person is still relatively low.
[01:00:35] <manicennui> Some states are seeing their highest spike of covid cases since the pandemic started right now.
[01:00:41] <dimadima> Dr. Jha noted that after an outbreak among vaccinated and unvaccinated workers at the Singapore airport, tracking studies suggested that most of the spread by vaccinated people happened when they had symptoms.
[01:00:49] <dimadima> yeah i heard that
[01:00:54] <dimadima> MN or MI
[01:00:59] <manicennui> VT
[01:01:12] <manicennui> VT also had the highest vax rates.
[01:01:15] <dimadima> Dr. Jha said. “The asymptomatic, pre-symptomatic spread could happen, but we haven’t seen it among vaccinated people with any frequency.”
[01:01:54] <manicennui> Seems likely that we'll need annual boosters like with the flu, but it would be nice if deaths and hospitalizations went down a lot.
[01:03:27] <defect> i got my booster and a flu shot at the same time
[01:03:35] <defect> if it's that convenient i don't mind doing it once a year
[01:04:21] <manicennui> I just hope that physicians get access to covid vaccines.
[01:04:37] <manicennui> Rather deal with everything at once.
[01:07:24] <ben> i got my flu shot and booster at costco
[01:07:26] <ben> same day, same arm
[01:07:42] <manicennui> Costco should do blood work and other things too.
[01:07:51] <manicennui> Slowly fulfilling the prophecy.
[01:07:55] <ben> idiocracy

[01:12:25] <buttsbot> Illinois’ weed tax windfall tops $560 million. Here’s where the money goes. - Chicago Sun-Times
[01:12:43] <manicennui> "The state’s collections since early 2020 now outpace that raised from booze sales."
[01:17:33] <Brekkjern> Now that I won't be having the exam on friday I suddenly have a lot of time to do fuck all
[01:17:40] <Brekkjern> Problem being, I don't know what to do with that time...
[01:18:03] <Brekkjern> I think it would be somewhat excessive to watch Arcane for the 4th time in two weeks, sooo... Suggestions? :P

[01:31:30] <buttsbot> Njalla — Worlds most notorious privacy provider for domains, VPS' and VPNs.
[01:32:26] <dimadima> and a .com domain with BTC?
[01:33:06] <dimadima> i thought you couldn't get a .com w/o an identity
[01:33:45] <dimadima> "Starting at €15 per month" though?
[01:34:10] <dimadima> i guess that's a typo. that's a bad typo
[01:36:12] <gerikson> dimadima: what's wrong with taxing dtugs?
[01:36:28] <gerikson> booze has a well-documented negative social effect
[01:36:44] <gerikson> jury is still out on weed but I doubt it's blameless
[01:37:02] <dimadima> something like 80% of booze sales in the US are alcoholics
[01:37:23] <dimadima> anyway, i'll skip all that and just say that i just personally don't like taxing "vice"
[01:37:34] <gerikson> eh I'm ok wiht it
[01:37:48] <dimadima> not going to bring a logical/rational perspective for it
[01:38:30] <dimadima> will not be able to, successfully, that is
[01:38:34] <indigo> Brekkjern: Fix the link handling in buttsbot
[01:38:35] <manicennui> I'm okay with the current situation with pot only because it is far better than where we were.
[01:38:40] <manicennui> But things need to get better.
[01:38:47] <Brekkjern> indigo: If I can be arsed :P
[01:38:57] <indigo> Brekkjern: Also relicense it so us MANGAs can contribute
[01:39:11] <Brekkjern> That sounds like work
[01:39:17] <indigo> Hahah
[01:39:18] <manicennui> Needs to be legalized at the federal level so dispensaries can use the banking system.
[01:39:24] <manicennui> And in IL we need far more licenses.
[01:39:33] <gerikson> well it's not enough to just tax it, you need to limit by age and location, pay for rehabilitation/miitigation etc
[01:40:15] <manicennui> A big chunk of IL's pot taxes go to programs for substance abuse and such.
[01:40:26] <ngoldbaum> weed rehab lol
[01:41:14] <manicennui> https://r3.illinois.gov/
[01:41:15] <buttsbot> illinois-r3
[01:41:24] <manicennui> R3 grants fund programs in Illinois communities that have been harmed by violence, excessive incarceration, and economic disinvestment.
[01:41:44] <indigo> Also lol Brekkjern, I just came back from Costco
[01:41:49] <indigo> Got my booster shot
[01:41:57] <manicennui> ~$75 million to that, and about $60 million to "Substance abuse and prevention and mental health concerns"
[01:42:13] <Brekkjern> indigo: Did someone in the door say "Welcome to Costco. I love you." when you walked in?
[01:42:31] <indigo> Not yet, but maybe in a couple of years
[01:42:37] <manicennui> indigo: Did you stop at Starbucks for a handjob?
[01:42:46] <indigo> Who knows what will happen with the next election
[01:42:48] <ngoldbaum> nice indigo
[01:42:57] <ngoldbaum> main side effect for me was a general sense of well-being
[01:43:01] <ngoldbaum> maybe some smug
[01:43:08] <indigo> manicennui: Nah; I did stop at In-N-Out for a delicious burger with Brawndo

[01:43:45] <Brekkjern> Now I kiiiiinda want to make buttsbot respond with the Idiocracy line whenever it sees anyone say Costco in the channel...
[01:43:49] <ngoldbaum> first time for everything
[01:43:52] <manicennui> Where is Carl's Jr. anyways?
[02:04:16] <dimadima> manicennui: there's not enough weed in IL?
[02:04:22] <dimadima> isn't there enough weed everywhere
[02:05:03] <manicennui> dimadima: Lack of competition, and there have been times when they fall back to servicing medical users first.
[02:05:05] <ngoldbaum> there’s not enough growers registered with the state for illinois corruption reasons
[02:05:26] <dimadima> whaaaaa
[02:05:27] <ngoldbaum> i used to have an illinois medical card and it was v nice
[02:05:27] <manicennui> I think even disregarding taxes our prices are like 20-30% higher than other states.
[02:05:39] <dimadima> lame
[02:05:47] <dimadima> fucking weed
[02:05:50] <dimadima> what a joke
[02:05:57] <ngoldbaum> dimadima: creating an artificially small market that cronies of lawmakers get special access to
[02:05:57] <manicennui> And the big companies buy up the independent shops.
[02:06:07] <dimadima> it's only been like 3 years
[02:06:07] <manicennui> I think our last independent shop is now owned by one of the national companies.
[02:06:09] <ngoldbaum> or first-movers who paid for lobbyists
[02:06:11] <dimadima> how are they consolidating already?
[02:06:26] <ngoldbaum> lots of money nationwide in cannabis
[02:06:47] <dimadima> apparently it's illegal to whitelabel weed

[02:07:53] <dimadima> i'm the only person who doesn't detect nuance in weed strains
[02:07:55] <manicennui> That is pretty insane.
[02:08:05] <manicennui> I doubt that any other kind of retail shop goes for anything close to that.
[02:08:05] <ngoldbaum> dimadima: no they’re all the same
[02:08:13] <ngoldbaum> it’s all marketing
[02:08:17] <hoistbypetard> dimadima: i assure you, you're not

[02:08:29] <ngoldbaum> there aren’t even any true indicas and sativas anymore they’re all hybrids
[02:08:36] <dimadima> to me it's like: schwag (which doesn't exist anymore) or not schwag
[02:08:57] <dimadima> back in college this one person used to sell me really cheap schwag. it was brown
[02:09:03] <dimadima> and different
[02:09:13] <dimadima> ever since then i've not seen schwag
[02:09:41] <hoistbypetard> someone tried to describe to me how one in particular was a really "heady" high, with lots of details

[02:10:23] <dimadima> ahhhh
[02:10:26] <ngoldbaum> dimadima: supposedly people get different effects based on the terpenes in the strain

[02:10:48] <manicennui> People here say you should just drive to Michigan.
[02:10:50] <dimadima> that produced a consistently, _really_ sleepy affect
[02:11:02] <dimadima> effect
[02:11:11] <dimadima> manicennui: sounds like it
[02:11:21] <dimadima> sounds like blajo is screwing the great people of IL
[02:11:25] <dimadima> (anything bad in IL i blame blago)
[02:11:39] <manicennui> We have a different rich asshole in charge now.
[02:11:46] <dimadima> pritzker
[02:11:49] <dimadima> but he's no blago
[02:11:54] <manicennui> I don't even think it is mostly his fault though.
[02:12:01] <manicennui> He seems not too bad.
[02:12:05] <ngoldbaum> pritzker is better than rauner was
[02:12:24] <dimadima> he seems like a desantis that's playing rich liberal
[02:12:29] <ngoldbaum> the state has had a budget, for one
[02:12:34] <manicennui> We all expected him to do rich asshole things, but he seems pretty progressive.
[02:12:40] <dimadima> but is really just a smart meathead
[02:12:43] <ngoldbaum> being an illinois state employee when there wasn’t a budget was “fun”
[02:12:51] <dimadima> s/smart/savy/
[02:12:52] <ngoldbaum> they were giving doctors IOU notes
[02:13:08] <dimadima> savvy, even
[02:13:22] <dimadima> just blame blagojevich
[02:13:52] <dimadima> who know who's the scariest person in the world is desantis
[02:14:03] <dimadima> he's absolutely terrifying to me
[02:15:05] <manicennui> He'll probably be president in 4-8 years.
[02:15:19] <manicennui> Where he can really fuck things up.
[02:16:00] <dimadima> huge chance of that
[02:16:02] <dimadima> it seems
[02:16:17] <dimadima> s/who know/you know/
[02:16:33] <manicennui> But I think Pritzker is actually doing a pretty good job. He isn't just slightly better than Rauner.
[02:16:52] <dimadima> being any politician in IL is hard word
[02:16:53] <dimadima> work
[02:16:58] <manicennui> In June 2019, Pritzker signed into law a bill that repeals the Illinois Abortion Law of 1975, which penalizes doctors for performing abortions considered "unnecessary", and the "Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act".
[02:17:23] <manicennui> "He joined the U.S. Climate Alliance which was made after President Trump withdrew the United States from the Paris Climate Accord"
[02:17:40] <manicennui> "He signed into law the Senate Bill 1890, whose goal is to crack down on human trafficking. It requires hospitality business owners to train their employees in recognizing victims of human trafficking and on protocols of reporting to authorities."
[02:17:42] <manicennui> The list goes on.
[02:18:00] <manicennui> Illinois has been pretty good about the pandemic too.
[02:19:21] <manicennui> I'm sure there are things he is doing less well, but he is a *huge* improvement over almost every governor we've had for a long time.
[02:19:31] <dimadima> that is good
[02:19:47] <manicennui> "On February 19, 2019, Pritzker signed into law a bill that raises the minimum wage statewide to $15 an hour by 2025"
[02:20:17] <dimadima> but that means prices will go up! :S
[02:20:34] <dimadima> either the rich make less or the prices go up!
[02:20:59] <dimadima> ($15/hour in 2021 is poverty level fwiw)
[02:21:10] <manicennui> The real question is whether he can deal with the pension problem.
[02:21:11] <dimadima> (not saying it's not something)
[02:22:25] <dimadima> the pension thing everywhere is a nightmare
[02:22:53] <manicennui> Based on what typically happens when Democrats do this well, I fully expect him to be involved in some kind of sex scandal.
[02:23:03] <manicennui> dimadima: IL is the second worse in the country.
[02:23:08] <manicennui> And Chicago has a similar problem.
[02:23:14] <dimadima> yeah
[02:23:38] <manicennui> I think IL's problem isn't fixable without a state constitutional amendment.
[02:23:41] <dimadima> oh he's definitely fuckin

[02:24:34] <ngoldbaum> he’s so rich he doesn’t need to sell any senate seats
[02:24:55] <dimadima> yeah i remember this a bit from my time
[02:25:52] <manicennui> Our mayor on the other hand is hot garbage.
[02:26:01] <dimadima> she sucks
[02:26:11] <manicennui> She quickly became more of the same.
[02:26:25] <manicennui> I do realize that her position is extremely difficult though.
[02:26:31] <manicennui> And there is probably no real fix to the pension problem.
[02:26:31] <dimadima> meh
[02:26:40] <dimadima> that's not why she sucks
[02:26:44] <dimadima> she sucks cause she's vacant
[02:26:58] <dimadima> like BdB
[02:27:06] <manicennui> But she seems to have fallen into the pattern of denying bad shit for as long as possible and trying to keep it out of the news.
[02:27:14] <dimadima> like BdB
[02:27:19] <dimadima> hear no evil see no evil
[02:27:29] <manicennui> BdB?
[02:27:32] <ngoldbaum> she also can’t do anything about the police unions either
[02:27:38] <ngoldbaum> deblasio
[02:27:38] <dimadima> bill deblasio
[02:27:42] <manicennui> Ah.
[02:28:01] <manicennui> Yeah, fuck Chicago PD.
[02:28:27] <dimadima> what about them
[02:28:32] <manicennui> They have two modes of operation: completely useless or unnecessary force.
[02:28:56] <dimadima> yeah
[02:29:04] <dimadima> i once got jumped by some teens
[02:29:10] <manicennui> We have a super low solve rate on homicides, and basically no one thinks they should call the police for much of anything because they won't do anything.
[02:29:14] <dimadima> trying to play the knockout game
[02:29:16] <dimadima> (they failed)
[02:29:28] <dimadima> i went to a cop and he was like "well did you hit them back?"
[02:29:38] <dimadima> "no, there was like 40 of them"
[02:29:39] <manicennui> And there seem to be several places in the city where they sleep in their cars.
[02:29:45] <dimadima> "why not?? you've got to defend yourself"
[02:29:47] <dimadima> ^ a cop
[02:29:52] <dimadima> like, thanks dad
[02:30:10] <dimadima> they don't do shit
[02:30:17] <dimadima> except protected Uchicago kids
[02:30:20] <dimadima> they were okay for that
[02:30:27] <dimadima> but we had UCpolice for that too
[02:30:42] <dimadima> but i guess that one cop told me to go fight a group of teenagers so
[02:30:49] <manicennui> And it's not just a recent thing, but it has gotten worse because they hate the mayor and they were mad about the covid vaccination requirement.
[02:31:00] <dimadima> sounds just like NY
[02:31:21] <manicennui> And then the mayor dropped the lawsuit to get them to comply.
[02:31:41] <manicennui> And they don't wear masks.
[02:31:41] <dimadima> smh
[02:31:49] <dimadima> all the same everywhere
[02:31:57] <dimadima> my friend was in panama a few weeks ago
[02:31:58] <manicennui> Just total fucking assholes.
[02:32:02] <dimadima> said the mask culture there is out of control
[02:32:08] <dimadima> i may have mentioned this here already
[02:32:18] <dimadima> everyone everywhere wears a mask.
[02:32:35] <dimadima> he was talking down a totally empty street w/o a mask and some construction worker told him to put on a mask
[02:32:51] <dimadima> he was with a group on a speedboat going like 30mph and they had to wear masks
[02:32:54] <ngoldbaum> the new denver mask mandate has a specific carve-out for cops
[02:33:09] <dimadima> not saying i understand needing to wear a mask on a speed boat
[02:33:20] <dimadima> but what a difference in culture over there
[02:33:26] <manicennui> Do you want to get the boat sick?
[02:33:35] <bkero> You should see the exceptions that cops have for vaccinations.
[02:33:52] <bkero> All essential, public-facing workers need to be vaccinated. Except for cops.
[02:34:02] <dimadima> fucking fuck
[02:34:11] <dimadima> cops
[02:34:21] <dimadima> but how will they breathe?!?!
[02:34:25] <dimadima> our finest
[02:34:28] <manicennui> They should be fired without exception.

[02:36:06] <dimadima> that's amazing
[02:36:18] <ngoldbaum> i seriously do not at all understand why anyone wouldn’t want to get these vaccines at this point
[02:36:22] <dimadima> <3
[02:36:33] <ngoldbaum> i guess being nervous made sense before billions of doses were given
[02:36:46] <ngoldbaum> at this point, if they were dangerous, we’d know
[02:37:00] <manicennui> I was hesitant months before the vaccine was available when Trump was pumping it up because Trump.
[02:37:30] <ngoldbaum> especially someone like a cop who has to deal with strangers all day
[02:37:30] <manicennui> The fact that other countries approved it too took away my hesitation.
[02:38:43] <manicennui> The worst part is that most cops are probably anti-vax because they share other reprehensible views with the largest groups of anti-vaxxers.
[02:39:18] <manicennui> Just people who should absolutely never be cops.

[03:01:14] <dasm> mindblown
[03:01:26] <manicennui> Did they think that ICE would check their political beliefs before deporting them?

[07:25:39] <manicennui> Oh, c2e2 is this weekend...
[07:31:51] <dimadima> whats that
[07:32:05] * dimadima googles
[07:32:12] <manicennui> Big comic convention in Chicago
[07:32:24] <manicennui> Comics and entertainment
[07:34:46] <dimadima> weird the site doesn't say what it is
[07:34:51] <dimadima> https://www.c2e2.com/en-us.html
[07:34:51] <buttsbot> C2E2
[07:35:26] <kline> dimadima, says in a big red box in the top left
[07:35:34] <kline> https://www.c2e2.com/content/dam/sitebuilder/rna/c2e2/2021/_img/framework/c2e2-header-logo-with-reedpop.png/_jcr_content/renditions/original.image_file.131.149.file/034782711/c2e2-header-logo-with-reedpop.png
[07:36:59] <manicennui> People generally just know.
[07:37:05] <manicennui> They sold out of 3-day badges.
[07:37:19] <manicennui> It's like the third largest comic convention in the US.
[07:37:34] <manicennui> The venue is massive.
[07:38:01] *** Quits: gco (~gco@2601:647:5a00:223:14ad:de7b:9961:3438) (Quit: ZZZzzz…)
[07:38:25] <manicennui> "The 2020 C2E2 was held Feb. 28 to March 1, just before the COVID-19 pandemic."
[07:38:32] <manicennui> I actually went to that one.
[07:39:17] <manicennui> Attendance was 95k that year.
[07:40:24] <bkero> Is that where you get Anime Covid?
[07:40:51] <manicennui> A lot of people go for celebrity photos, which I've never understood. Now they will have to get photos with celebs in masks, which seems even worse.
[07:41:13] <manicennui> bkero: The anime is limited at c2e2. We have separate huge anime conventions.
[07:41:28] <bkero> But there hasn't been any comic covid discovered, only anime covid
[07:44:56] <manicennui> What about wrestling covid? There tend to be a lot of wrestlers there.
[07:46:18] <manicennui> Looks like several power rangers will be there too.
[07:48:41] <manicennui> And several people who were in the Mortal Kombat games.
[07:48:42] <manicennui> https://mortalkombat.fandom.com/wiki/Phillip_Ahn,_M.D.
[07:48:42] <buttsbot> Phillip Ahn | Mortal Kombat Wiki | Fandom
[07:48:56] <manicennui> "He is not an actor, but by starring as Shang Tsung in Mortal Kombat II, he gained fame with younger people. He wrote an autobiography, Mortal Doctor, that details his experiences filming Shang Tsung for Mortal Kombat 2."
[07:49:16] <kline> weird, gives an empty page here
[07:50:13] <kline> oh, needs the trailing .
[07:50:13] <manicennui> Looks like the final period isn't being included in the URL
[07:50:57] <manicennui> I honestly never thought about the fact that the people in the Mortal Kombat games were actors.
[07:55:42] <kline> it was rotoscoped, right?
[07:55:53] <manicennui> I don't actually know.
[07:56:09] <Church> Welp, I forgot my sister's birthday. Fuck my life

[07:58:43] <manicennui> That is cool as fuck
[07:58:49] <Church> Not like my sister probably cares, but my mother is never gonna let me live it down.
[08:01:27] <ngoldbaum> reminded of how dumb this is https://www.goldennumber.net/wp-content/uploads/pepsi-arnell-021109.pdf
[08:01:50] <gwozniak> Church: once you get to your 40s, it no longer matters :)
[08:02:30] <gwozniak> ngoldbaum: breathtaking design strategy
[08:03:18] <manicennui> What reminded you of that?
[08:03:30] <gwozniak> I called out some business platitude nonsense in a team meeting today
[08:04:20] <manicennui> The pre-1962 Pepsi logos are really cool.
[08:07:26] <manicennui> kline: You like Ralph Bakshi's stuff?
[08:07:30] <gwozniak> Better than the 80s one, that's for sure

[08:09:26] <gwozniak> reviewing this Pepsi thing, I can see how it could work as something to dazzle or hypnotize some execs
[08:09:40] <kline> manicennui, ive only seen Cool World which was interesting but not good
[08:09:45] <manicennui> I gotta imagine that these people were influenced by Bakshi: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xwj-mBVzpY

[08:09:59] <manicennui> kline: I've actually not seen any of it, but I like the art.
[08:10:04] <manicennui> I want to see his LOTR.
[08:10:54] <Church> gwozniak: Oh I'm aware but good god is my mother gonna heckle me and give me the cold shoulder for months. Oy ve

[08:13:53] <manicennui> Just tell her that you were waiting to buy a PS5 or Nvidia card for your sister.
[08:14:25] <imode> it has been nearly six hours.
[08:14:29] <imode> and I am done with this fucking patch.
[08:14:41] <imode> I want to strangle whoever wrote this library.
[08:14:57] <imode> you do not get to reinvent assertions and then use the exceptions you throw as sentinel values.

[08:16:11] <gwozniak> That "Spine of Night" trailer reminds me of "Mandy". I'd totally watch it

[08:24:03] <Church> gwozniak: Needless to say I'm bringing my sister her gifts and seeing if she wants to see a movie or something.
[08:24:30] <Church> Sigh... and then I need to go over for Christmas.
[08:24:35] <manicennui> "NO BELT, NO KNEE WRAPS, NO SQUAT SUIT, JUST SIDEWALK KRACKIN ASS MUSCLE!!"
[08:24:39] <Church> Oh well, such is life.
[08:28:27] <gwozniak> Church: if your sister is cool with it, then all is well
[08:29:07] <gwozniak> I don't know how long ago it was, but I had to start asking people not to get me things
[08:29:15] <gwozniak> On birthdays and such, I mean
[08:29:32] <gwozniak> I just don't need any more trinkets and, frankly, crap
[08:30:18] <manicennui> Same.
[08:30:28] <manicennui> I don't exchange gifts with anyone anymore.
[08:30:34] <manicennui> It's great.
[08:33:05] <gwozniak> I'll get a gift if I think it's unique and of particular interest or meaning to the person
[08:33:30] <gwozniak> But I don't go searching for them.  I have to happen upon them
[08:34:10] <gwozniak> Although I didn't get my wife a Christmas present a few years ago (after explicitly saying we should avoid getting gifts) and that did not go over well
[08:35:12] <gwozniak> ``In addition, the average home price in the region [Toronto] increased to $1,163,323, an almost 22 per cent jump from $955,889 in November 2020.''  Toronto real estate in a nutshell
[08:35:44] <manicennui> I recently learned that Pittsburgh is ridiculously affordable.
[08:36:08] <manicennui> "In October 2021, the median listing home price in Pittsburgh, PA was $229.8K, trending up 2.2% year-over-year."
[08:38:17] <gwozniak> A house near here sold for $270K in 2009.  It just sold the other day for $1MM
[08:38:55] <manicennui> I still don't understand how so many people can afford million dollar homes.
[08:39:18] <bkero> A million dollar home is like a $4000/mo mortgage.
[08:39:44] <gwozniak> Yeah, at $5K a month, with no interest, it takes ~16.5 years to pay off
[08:39:48] <manicennui> Plus property taxes
[08:39:54] <bkero> That's about 50-55% of a 160k/year income
[08:40:01] <bkero> (after taxes)
[08:40:39] <dimadima> woah gwozniak
[08:40:57] <manicennui> Property taxes on a million dollar home here would be another ~$15k per year.
[08:41:46] <bkero> Not if it's company property
[08:42:04] <gwozniak> This house in question had property taxes of a little over $3000 a year
[08:42:34] <dimadima> at the $1MM value?
[08:43:11] <gwozniak> Unknown. It will probably go up.
[08:43:29] <gwozniak> If anyone is interested: https://www.theglobeandmail.com/real-estate/toronto/article-burlington-semi-draws-11-offers-sells-200099-over-asking/
[08:43:30] <buttsbot> Burlington semi draws 11 offers, sells $200,099 over asking - The Globe and Mail
[08:43:56] <gwozniak> Btw, this kind of story is common these days
[08:44:07] <gwozniak> $200K over asking happens a lot
[08:44:50] <gwozniak> Sorry, it was $299K in 2009 ($270K in 2006)
[08:45:36] <manicennui> I could buy a house that I'd actually want to live in for cash in the Pittsburgh metro.
[08:46:04] <manicennui> I've yet to discover what the downside of Pittsburgh is.
[08:52:49] <dimadima> it's in western PA
[08:53:02] <dimadima> aka west virginia
[08:53:15] <dimadima> no disrespect west virginia
[08:53:20] <dimadima> it's just in the middle of nowhere appalachia
[08:53:53] <dimadima> or pseudo-appalachia
[08:54:45] <manicennui> Chicago is in the middle of the Midwest...
[08:55:09] <manicennui> We don't even have natural beauty to fall back on.
[08:56:21] <dimadima> i think chicago is in a much better spot than pittsburgh
[08:56:39] <manicennui> Maybe during the industrial revolution.
[08:57:03] <dimadima> i dunno pittsburgh was well positioned for that too
[08:57:10] <manicennui> Better how though?
[08:57:22] <manicennui> I much rather be in western PA from a natural beauty perspective.
[08:57:30] <dimadima> it's more near wisconsin and the lakes and all that stuff
[08:57:37] <manicennui> Weather is very similar.
[08:57:39] <dimadima> and to colorado etc
[08:57:47] <manicennui> How is being near WI an advantage?
[08:57:54] <manicennui> Not at all close to CO.
[08:57:56] <dimadima> lake nature stuff
[08:58:02] <dimadima> i mean the real west
[08:58:17] <ben> WI has cows
[08:58:42] <dimadima> s/mean/meant/
[08:58:53] <manicennui> Pittsburgh is hilly and covered in trees and there are decent elevation changes all over.
[08:59:06] <dimadima> yeah it's hill country
[08:59:12] <ben> chicago is great fun but yeah there's very little nature nearby
[08:59:15] <dimadima> rust belt hill country is the last place i want to be
[08:59:43] <dimadima> i don't want want to be in impoverished new mexico and then i don't want to be in rust belt hill country
[08:59:59] <dimadima> that's my #1 and #2 top places i don't want to live in the US
[09:00:22] <dimadima> pairie is nice
[09:00:25] <dimadima> ie illinois
[09:00:43] <manicennui> Pittsburgh is a very progressive city though.
[09:00:49] <dimadima> i could be totally wrong about pittsburgh btw :)
[09:00:57] <dimadima> that was just my vibe going through
[09:01:07] <dimadima> i'd totally try living in columbus
[09:01:18] <manicennui> I'm the opposite.
[09:01:21] <dimadima> is it progressive?
[09:01:24] <manicennui> I would never live in Columbus.
[09:01:26] <dimadima> it's very football
[09:01:28] <manicennui> dimadima: Very.
[09:01:37] <dimadima> you probably know columbus better than me
[09:01:40] <manicennui> PA is a blue state, and the cities are very blue.
[09:01:58] <manicennui> I don't know a lot about Columbus, but it seems like one of those sprawling suburb type cities.
[09:02:06] <dimadima> i'm not inherently attracted to blue state city living
[09:02:25] <dimadima> pittsburgh is nice though
[09:02:29] <manicennui> What exactly are you into?
[09:02:30] <dimadima> the area around CMU is nice
[09:02:37] <dimadima> nothing i'm not into anything
[09:02:43] <manicennui> I see.
[09:03:03] <manicennui> Just trying to figure out what it is you actually like and don't like to determine how to use your opinion on Pittsburgh.
[09:03:28] <manicennui> My arguments for Chicago would not at all include location.
[09:03:44] <dimadima> i woudln't use it. i've been to pittsburgh twice for a total of like 6 days probably
[09:04:11] <manicennui> I usually find about a week to be enough to get a good feel for a place.
[09:04:30] <manicennui> Unless you just stay at the hotel for a conference or something.
[09:04:30] <dimadima> i've driven through in addition one time too
[09:04:35] <dimadima> had a sandwich at primantis
[09:05:01] *** Quits: sudoforge (~sudoforge@wireguard/tunneler/sudoforge) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[09:05:06] <dimadima> university of pittsburgh was pretty cool too
[09:05:24] <manicennui> I mostly just don't understand why it is so cheap.
[09:05:27] <dimadima> the Cathedral of Learning
[09:05:28] <dimadima> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathedral_of_Learning
[09:05:28] <buttsbot> Cathedral of Learning - Wikipedia
[09:05:46] <manicennui> It seem comparable to other smaller metro areas.
[09:05:52] <dimadima> manicennui: i think cause it's in like, the middle of nowhere rustbelt not by a lake or anything
[09:06:24] <manicennui> I honestly never go to the lake here.
[09:06:34] <manicennui> I like lakes, but generally prefer smaller ones.
[09:06:34] <dimadima> the Cathedral of Learning makes a trip to Pittsburgh worth it in its own right I must say
[09:06:41] <manicennui> And it is on multiple rivers.
[09:06:54] <manicennui> I don't go to cities for touristy things.
[09:07:21] <dimadima> I wouldn't say the Cathedral of Learning is touristy
[09:07:31] <manicennui> Although I'd probably ride the incline in Pittsburgh.
[09:07:47] <dimadima> i'm never one to ride the incline
[09:07:55] <dimadima> my family has always made me do it
[09:08:33] <dimadima> i think i'm phobic of those things
[09:09:04] <dimadima> like that one fell the other week somewhere. Italy? Switzerland?
[09:09:23] <manicennui> The incline isn't suspended though.
[09:09:32] <dimadima> still makes me uneasy
[09:09:44] <dimadima> irrationally i know
[09:10:11] <manicennui> Does the CTA make you uneasy?
[09:10:19] <dimadima> no
[09:11:50] <manicennui> CTA trains actually have derailed and injured people in the last several years.
[09:13:05] <manicennui> There is a new "flyover" near Belmont that is 45 feet in the air.
[09:13:25] <dimadima> what line? why?
[09:13:26] <dimadima> redline?
[09:13:37] <dimadima> the red line is often quite high
[09:13:43] <dimadima> as is the orange line often
[09:13:51] <manicennui> Because the red and brown lines cross.
[09:13:59] <dimadima> yikes
[09:14:06] <manicennui> The flyover allows them to not have to stop and wait for switches.
[09:14:21] <dimadima> yeah i dunno public transit like that seems fine to me
[09:15:01] <manicennui> https://www.transitchicago.com/assets/1/6/MainFCKEditorDimension/2015rpm_Clark_Junction_-_After.jpg
[09:15:42] <dimadima> awesome
[09:15:51] <dimadima> gah chicago
[09:16:10] <dimadima> everywhere should bring back streetcars or something
[09:16:15] <dimadima> baltimore used to have streetcars
[09:16:46] <manicennui> Some places are, but it is called "light rail" now.
[09:18:05] <dimadima> yeah whatever it is, public transit is still rough most overwhere
[09:18:21] <manicennui> I think LA has quite a bit of it now.
[09:18:31] <dimadima> do people ride it
[09:18:47] <manicennui> I believe so.
[09:19:36] <dimadima> baltimore has a 1-line metro
[09:19:39] <dimadima> can you believe it
[09:19:57] <dimadima> it was built in the 70s and early-mid 80s
[09:19:59] <manicennui> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Metro_Rail#Ridership
[09:19:59] <buttsbot> Los Angeles Metro Rail - Wikipedia
[09:20:16] <manicennui> "Metro's light rail system is the busiest in the United States with 203,300 average weekday boardings during the second quarter of 2018.[7] At 83.6 miles (134.5 km)[8] Metro's light rail system is the second largest in the United States."
[09:21:00] <dimadima>  203,300 average weekday
[09:21:10] <dimadima> that's something
[09:21:15] <manicennui> First largest appears to be Dallas' system.
[09:21:33] <dimadima> would be cool to fund transit
[09:21:40] <dimadima> see what it takes us
[09:21:49] <dimadima> ;)
[09:22:40] <manicennui> https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/07/wall-street-believes-biden-build-back-better-bill-will-become-law.html
[09:22:46] <dimadima> holy crap it's 1am
[09:23:15] <dimadima> will this bill build public transit throughout the country in a cost effective, sustainable manner
[09:23:42] <manicennui> https://www.masstransitmag.com/management/article/21244437/build-back-better-bill-contains-nearly-20-billion-better-transit-and-highspeed-rail
[09:23:42] <buttsbot> StackPath
[09:23:48] <manicennui> You know it won't be cost effective.
[09:24:03] <manicennui> We can't build cost effective transportation in the US.
[09:24:23] <dimadima> i'm not saying profitable i'm saying like something close to on par with places that do public transit most effectively
[09:24:32] <dimadima> not like 100x more expensive like it is now
[09:24:38] <manicennui> Neither am I.
[09:24:38] <dimadima> but maybe... 10x?
[09:24:49] <manicennui> We pay far, far more than most countries per mile of road, rail, etc.
[09:24:56] <manicennui> Someone has to profit.
[09:25:03] <dimadima> northrop gruman!
[09:25:25] <dimadima> :|
[09:25:46] <dimadima> i wouldn't be surprised if a company like halliburton got into building public infrastructure
[09:30:01] <kline> i think the developed world is mostly past the point of being able to effectively execute large infrastructure projects
[09:31:00] <kline> doesnt even have to be transport infra, think about trying to lay water/sewerage pipes, or telecoms cabling or fibre
[09:32:40] <dimadima> why do you think that is kline
[09:32:58] <kline> the UK home secretary launched a new scheme for the emergency resettlement of afghans in mid august and its still not actually launched
[09:33:15] <kline> dimadima, i dont want to say "capitalism" but its something akin to that
[09:33:28] <manicennui> It is definitely capitalism.
[09:33:45] <kline> every step of the process seems to be festooned with middlemen both inside and outside of the process looking to somehow get their cut or make their mark
[09:34:11] <manicennui> The projects cost too much due to multiple layers of people making profit, and despite the fantasy everyone likes to believe, private companies are rarely efficient.
[09:34:18] <kline> and the desire to litigate to ensure it slows everything down
[09:34:33] <manicennui> They have incentives not to be efficient because in most cases governments will just keep shelling out money.
[09:35:05] <kline> well, at least most companies can inefficiency themselves to death
[09:35:14] <kline> whereas govts are too big to fail
[09:35:22] <kline> there are some companies that sit in the middle, sure
[09:35:24] <manicennui> It doesn't seem to happen much though.
[09:35:44] <manicennui> I worked at UHG for a bit, who has over 100k employees, and it was difficult to see how anything to done at all.
[09:35:47] <kline> well, most of them are small to medium businesses
[09:36:01] <kline> once you get big you're mostly ok
[09:36:02] <manicennui> s/to done/got done/
[09:36:51] <manicennui> At the low end of construction you have companies doing terrible work, often not even completing jobs, then just closing down the company and starting a new one.
[09:37:06] <kline> i think maybe something that would be helpful is for all companies to have mission statements explaining where and what they do
[09:37:36] <manicennui> Are you being sarcastic?
[09:38:04] <kline> i really dont like that there are some organisations that exist to hoover stuff up, think consultancies, orgs like g4s/iss that exist as contracting umbrellas,
[09:38:06] <kline> etc
[09:38:30] <kline> these are the most naked middlemen, they will take any contract they can and immediately subcontract the entire thing to someone else
[09:40:44] <manicennui> I think we need something like the Army Corps of Engineers for infrastructure work that is not part of the military.
[09:40:56] <kline> why not the military?
[09:41:10] <manicennui> Because I'd like it to be larger without making the military larger.
[09:41:28] <kline> why wouldnt you like the military to be larger?
[09:41:35] <manicennui> The Army Corps of Engineers already handles certain civil projects like dams and such.
[09:41:49] <manicennui> kline: Because we tend to use our military for bad things.
[09:42:15] <kline> its interesting because ive found that most of the military is generally quietly used for good things
[09:42:28] <manicennui> "USACE has 37,000 civilian and military personnel,[3] making it one of the world's largest public engineering, design, and construction management agencies. Some of its dams, reservoirs, and flood control projects also serve as public outdoor recreation facilities. Its hydroelectric projects provide 24% of U.S. hydropower capacity. It is headquartered in Washington, D.C. and has a budget of $7.8 billion (FY2021).[4]"
[09:42:40] <manicennui> I'm not sure why they are focused on dams and such.
[09:42:42] <kline> but nothing gets airtime like the 1% of deployed infantry who spend 1% of their time doing bad things
[09:43:44] <manicennui> Probably because of the millions of people they murder, displace, etc.
[09:43:58] <kline> in the UK the military has provided flood relief, assistance to the national health service as ambulance drivers, covid planners, and medics, they patch dams in probably the greatest PR coup, provide air traffic services, etc
[09:44:25] <kline> theyre the really executive arm of the govt and people should elect better govts
[09:44:29] <dimadima> i'm not one to shit on the military in general
[09:44:36] <manicennui> I am.
[09:44:51] <dimadima> but woudln't it be better to have civil things done by civil orgs as much as possible
[09:45:02] <manicennui> But the USACE seems legit.
[09:45:52] <dimadima> you worked at a 100k employer manicennui
[09:45:56] <kline> dimadima, not sure what its like in the US but in the UK we're basically dual purpose. a large amount of stuff is MACA - military aid to civil authorities and so far im 3 years into my career and done 0 warfighting stuff and all of it has been civil assistance that just happens to be great practice for the crisis management we need
[09:45:58] <dimadima> far out
[09:46:09] <manicennui> dimadima: Yes, but it isn't like we were all in one location.
[09:46:32] <manicennui> I worked for a company that was acquired and then that company was acquired by UHG.
[09:46:52] <dimadima> kline: i think in the US we try to keep the military out of civil life as possible but the "army corp of engineers" does lots of municipal work like flood-related things
[09:47:11] <dimadima> as much as possible*
[09:47:12] <manicennui> Coast Guard is technically part of the military, no?
[09:47:18] <dimadima> yeah for sure
[09:47:28] <kline> we have the same, right now the military transport and engineering arms are helping with a post-storm power crisiss
[09:48:06] <kline> several thousand people have been without power for almost 2 weeks after a major storm basically eradicated all infrastructure and its the military going round with hot food and drinks and assisting the power companies
[09:48:29] <manicennui> National Guard does some of that kind of stuff too.
[09:48:31] <dimadima> we're supposed to have FEMA for that
[09:48:35] <kline> and it makes sense to use the military because its basically free training for people we're paying anyway
[09:48:41] <dimadima> yeah i guess the national guard does that
[09:49:10] <manicennui> kline: I'd just like to see an option for people that never leads to combat.
[09:49:20] <manicennui> There are of course a bunch of non-profits that do it.
[09:49:49] <kline> manicennui, realstically, the army engineers are never going to be in combat
[09:50:00] <manicennui> Peace Corps is kind of what I'm thinking, but their focus is international.
[09:50:23] <manicennui> kline: They build bases in bridges in warzones though.
[09:50:33] <manicennui> bases and bridges
[09:50:35] <kline> yeah
[09:50:47] <kline> and then what?
[09:51:11] <manicennui> My point is it would be nice to have the option to not support our foreign adventures at all.
[09:51:30] <kline> vote for better governments
[09:51:32] <manicennui> But you still kind of want the discipline
[09:51:55] <manicennui> kline: Unfortunately a good chunk of the population doesn't want things to be better.
[09:53:09] <kline> manicennui, tbh i think the west is mostly in the worst kind of war just now where we have arms-length intervention with no real plan for progress because its safe, cheap, and polls well
[09:53:49] <kline> lots of FJ bombing, arms/funding, and consultation but with no real plan or stake
[09:53:57] <kline> but i dont think the west can think in terms of 100 year plans
[09:55:06] <manicennui> Because the goal isn't to make those countries better.
[09:55:12] <manicennui> We just want a more favorable government.
[09:55:26] <manicennui> We didn't even manage that in Afghanistan.
[09:56:43] <dimadima> failing in afghanistan doesn't say much
[09:57:01] <dimadima> considering it was inevitable
[09:57:37] <kline> i dont think afghanistan is doomed to failure every time but i do think it takes a certain cultural awareness, lots and lots of time, and willingness to break a few eggs for that omelette to work out
[09:58:14] <dimadima> what constitutes breaking a few eggs
[09:58:21] <manicennui> Most of these places don't make sense as countries, and in a lot of cases we made them up in the early 20th century.
[09:58:30] <kline> dimadima, kurdistan, at least
[09:58:39] <Church> Finally, a nix RSS feed in my reader.
[09:58:45] <Church> The glory day has come.
[09:59:01] <dimadima> kline: i'm confused what does kurdistan have to do with afghanistan?
[09:59:04] <kline> manicennui, yeah, but breaking up these broders will be insane
[09:59:05] <dimadima> and are you saying we should have split that off
[09:59:11] <dimadima> cause yeah that was criminal :(
[09:59:23] <manicennui> We should have never put some of them together.
[09:59:33] <dimadima> would that that improved the rest of iraq?
[09:59:33] <manicennui> I don't know about Afghanistan in particular, but we basically made Iraq.
[09:59:42] <dimadima> i don't know
[09:59:54] <dimadima> the ottomans made iraq and on a lower level the iraqis are real is my impression
[10:00:00] <dimadima> in terms of the tribal thing going on there
[10:00:05] <kline> dimadima, i think realistically yes, we should be re-reworking the borders in the middle east to reflect reality rather than colonial ease
[10:00:31] <manicennui> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq#British_administration_and_independent_kingdom
[10:00:31] <buttsbot> Iraq - Wikipedia
[10:00:43] <kline> i dont think theres any mandate for it nor any country nor organisation i would trust to do it
[10:00:47] <manicennui> The country today known as Iraq was a region of the Ottoman Empire until the partition of the Ottoman Empire in the 20th century. It was made up of three provinces, called vilayets in the Ottoman language: Mosul Vilayet, Baghdad Vilayet, and Basra Vilayet. These three provinces were joined into one Kingdom by the British after the region became a League of Nations mandate, administered under British control, with the name
[10:00:47] <manicennui> "State of Iraq".
[10:01:00] <kline> but the middle east has always been a nightmare but it didnt get any better with how things got divided up
[10:01:57] <kline> if we really wanted to bring the middle east up to the standard of living and lifestyle as the west itd need to be a hundred years at least of initially military, then economic, then political redesign and bootstrapping
[10:02:39] <kline> this is of course if you're ok with wiping an entire family of cultures out to expand the western hegemony and homogenise the world
[10:02:54] <dimadima> yeah
[10:02:59] <dimadima> i was going to say
[10:03:11] <manicennui> kline: Parts of it were before we fucked with it some more.
[10:03:17] <dimadima> personally i'm cool with just leaving the middle east alone and letting it chill out
[10:03:20] <kline> alternatively we can just butt out and let them get on with it rather than constantly finger wagging through a low intensity bombing campaign and economic sanctions that keep them there forever
[10:03:29] <dimadima> i'm not sure about "but the middle east has always been a nightmare"
[10:03:41] <dimadima> i have this feeling that if we left it alone it would chill out pretty quickly
[10:03:48] <manicennui> I don't see it as any of our business.
[10:03:50] <kline> but this also means accepting probably hundreds of more years of truly brutal misogyny, tribal infighting, corruption, and public illhealth
[10:04:02] <dimadima> it's not ours to accept or reject?
[10:04:04] <manicennui> Just as our country should be none of theirs.
[10:04:53] <kline> im not fundamentally against just letting them get on with it but i think itd be a difficult pill for the west to swallow
[10:05:04] <dimadima> on what level
[10:05:10] <manicennui> But that will never happen because we have to create favorable conditions for our corporations.
[10:05:12] <dimadima> they're not even so backwards
[10:05:22] <dimadima> are they even that backwards at all
[10:05:49] <kline> dimadima, do you think the west is really ok with everything ranging from FGM and a total lack of womens rights, all the way through to nuclear proliferation?
[10:05:53] <dimadima> how much worse is egypt than belarus
[10:06:13] <kline> fgm is nsfw, fwiw
[10:06:17] <dimadima> nuclear proliferation isn't FGM
[10:06:19] <manicennui> kline: I don't think the West cares about most of those things other than nuclear weapons.
[10:06:19] <kline> female genital mutilation
[10:06:38] <dimadima> and yeah it seems like the west is okay with nuclear proliferation
[10:06:47] <manicennui> The West cares about the ability for corporations to exploit resources in other parts of the world and not much more.
[10:06:48] <dimadima> despite the blustering
[10:07:15] <manicennui> Look at all of the shit we are willing to overlook in China to continue to do business there.
[10:07:19] <dimadima> yeah
[10:07:20] <kline> i dont really think its true and its probably less and less true
[10:07:50] <dimadima> i dunnnno
[10:07:57] <kline> i think we're going to be more and more value driven, for example, look at the public unhappiness regaring the uyghurs
[10:08:11] <dimadima> much of the american media/entertainment industry bends backwards with zeal for china
[10:08:30] <dimadima> much -> most of
[10:08:42] <dimadima> and they don't care about FGM either
[10:08:52] <manicennui> Our entire economy depends on manufacturing in China at this point.
[10:08:55] <dimadima> it's like "free tibet" or "free mumiya"
[10:09:02] <dimadima> yeah
[10:09:31] <kline> manicennui, yes, so think about how much of a big deal it is that the US govt is boycotting the winter olympics and the WTA etc are cancelling their tours
[10:09:36] <kline> big money, big politics
[10:09:44] <dimadima> i mean jesus just 4 hours ago i posted tucker carlson saying putin has the right to defend his western border
[10:09:52] <kline> i think its too late and mostly ineffectual
[10:09:56] <manicennui> kline: Those things are tiny in comparison.
[10:10:28] <kline> but imagine if whats happening with regards to china was happening in some country that wasnt as important and we didnt have the cultural baggage of afghanistan so fresh
[10:10:33] <dimadima> yes i just saw today the olympic boycott but just the headline and then got distracted. is that for real?
[10:10:36] <kline> im sure we'd be very keen to spread western values
[10:11:10] <kline> dimadima, yes, multiple countries are now enacting diplomatic boycotts (ie, atheletes can still go but the usual diplomatic junkets are cancelled)
[10:11:21] <dimadima> yes seeing this now
[10:11:24] <dimadima> that's wild
[10:11:39] <dimadima> pretty cool
[10:11:59] <dimadima> i wonder what happened
[10:13:49] <kline> values politics coming back into play, mostly spurred by peng shuai
[10:14:44] <kline> (chinese tennis ace who accused the former party #2 of sexual coercion and then disappeared apart from some dubious non-emails and a short videoconference with the olympics committee)
[10:15:27] <kline> (the world tennis association has not been so blessed as to have any kind of direct contact, presumably because they cant cancel the winter olympics that would be a crushing PR blow)
[10:16:16] <kline> its only the usual chinese political disappearance, same as happened to jack ma, the female actress, etc
[10:16:31] <kline> but peng clearly has a bit more cultural hold given shes a public figure seen outside of china
[10:17:44] <kline> (i said coercion but what im really getting at is a pattern of alleged sexual assults under duress, due to the power differential meaning you cant really give consent)
[10:17:47] <dimadima> has got to be something more than that?
[10:17:54] <kline> more than what?
[10:18:05] <dimadima> peng shuai
[10:18:10] <dimadima> as big as that was
[10:18:40] <dimadima> values politics coming back into play? did they ever leave?
[10:18:54] <kline> i really dont know, maybe its just convenient given the US is halfheartedly trying to take a stand despite signalling in hard terms theyve given up on the world stage
[10:20:28] <kline> but certainly these days theres a political right and wrong driven by public values that didnt exist nearly as strongly in the past. i dont know when corporations started to celebrate civil movements, for example, but now its practically death not to
[10:20:43] *** Quits: martian67| (~martian67@user/martian67) (Remote host closed the connection)
[10:20:47] <kline> im not saying if thats right or wrong, im just highlighting these value politics as being as powerful as they have become
[10:21:09] *** Joins: martian67 (~martian67@user/martian67)
[10:21:48] <kline> for example, in the UK the vast majority of those at immediate risk are the predominantly male workers who contracted with the occupation forces as translaters, guides, fixers, etc
[10:22:11] <kline> but the media and political focus has been on girls and women who return to a state of oppression and persecution
[10:22:45] <kline> really, we should take them all over and shelter anyone at risk, but again the balance is with values more than stats
[10:24:44] <dimadima> i see what you mean
[10:25:18] <kline> anyway, the things mostly junk because the wests time in the sun is over. i hope you know mandarin
[10:25:29] <dimadima> heh
[10:25:43] <dimadima> hmm
[10:26:07] <dimadima> i don't know
[10:26:13] <kline> oh?
[10:26:21] <dimadima> i'm not counting the west out or china in
[10:26:28] <dimadima> you can't even read wikipedia in china
[10:26:34] <dimadima> freedom counts a lot in my book
[10:26:38] <kline> whats that got to do with the price of fish?
[10:26:42] <dimadima> i'm not very cynical about that either
[10:26:49] <dimadima> everything
[10:27:10] <kline> china doesnt need to have everywhere adopt its domestic policy, just end up china-aligned
[10:27:29] <dimadima> china doesn't offer people freedom
[10:27:35] <kline> people talk about the fear, for example, of taiwan being invaded but tbh give it 50 years and i think they will choose to unify voluntarily
[10:27:59] <dimadima> not seeing that happen
[10:28:05] <dimadima> no wy
[10:28:08] <dimadima> way*
[10:28:14] <dimadima> taiwanese ppl will die on that island
[10:28:20] <dimadima> literally and figuratively
[10:28:36] <dimadima> china is smoke and mirrors
[10:28:47] <dimadima> like all totalitarian regimes
[10:28:51] <dimadima> not _all_
[10:29:21] <kline> why? in 50 years china will be the dominant political and economic force in the world, all the taiwanese ideologues who founded the place will be dead, and youll have lots of young people eager to find their place with the new global power
[10:29:24] <dimadima> a huge percentage of humans can't wake up every day knowing they're not allowed to read wikipedia
[10:29:33] <dimadima> many can, and don't care
[10:29:35] <dimadima> but many cannot
[10:29:48] <dimadima> that's a big thing that china will have to contend with
[10:29:53] <kline> you say that
[10:30:00] <kline> but 20% of the world dont even know it exists
[10:30:07] <kline> thats just counting china
[10:30:11] <dimadima> i mean figuratively
[10:30:23] <kline> most chinese people are fundamentally happy
[10:30:32] <dimadima> we'll see
[10:30:35] <dimadima> hopeully :)
[10:30:36] <kline> many are patriotic, even
[10:30:43] <dimadima> i think many are
[10:31:16] <dimadima> will be interesting!
[10:31:58] <kline> in practice, the west has signalled that its withdrawing from the world stage. afghanistation, crimea, HK, withdrawal from major international institutions and alliances, lack of action on the 9-dash line, etc
[10:32:25] <kline> the west has already ruled out military action should an invasion of ukraine occur
[10:32:48] <kline> remember, ukraine gave up its nuclear weapons on the promise of western support on its territorial integrity
[10:32:54] <dimadima> of course
[10:33:21] <kline> and we've allowed them to lose crimea and when it comes to their mainland we've essentially said to russia "you can only have it if you pay a lot of money"
[10:33:33] <kline> nothing even permanent, economic sanctions never last
[10:33:46] <kline> brexit
[10:33:47] <dimadima> yeah thats pretty shitty
[10:33:57] <dimadima> i wish there was a line drawn at ukraine
[10:34:02] <dimadima> pretty sad they didn't draw it
[10:34:14] <dimadima> putin wouldn't have crossed it
[10:34:39] <kline> its very clear the anglosphere and western states are collapsing into infighting while abandoning their desire to flex muscle internationally
[10:34:56] *** Joins: dcz_ (~dcz@user/dcz)
[10:35:03] <kline> so for china its just a case of biding time and using the DI and E levers of power
[10:35:09] <dimadima> i'm not sure that means we'll have a chinese superpower in 50 years
[10:35:29] <dimadima> to some extent i kind of "believe" the chinese thing about not wanting to be a super power, in the first place
[10:35:35] <kline> theyre already treating africa and the middle east the same way we treated china, the untapped and underdeveloped source of raw labour to support their growth into higher industry
[10:35:47] <kline> not without caveats of course, see the african congress building
[10:36:29] <kline> african union, rather, my bad
[10:36:33] <dimadima> i think with the shrinking of the world we're going to have a lot more diversity of power
[10:36:36] <dimadima> in the future
[10:37:03] <dimadima> but who knows
[10:37:11] <dimadima> i'll be damned if china takes over everything
[10:37:15] <dimadima> could be though
[10:37:20] <kline> could be
[10:37:50] <dimadima> everyone's so down on the west
[10:37:58] <dimadima> it's a crazy time right now
[10:38:05] <kline> i think we'll probably see more megacorps rise into public utility and governance space unless we take a fairly rapid tack towards regulation etc
[10:38:13] <dimadima> see there we go
[10:38:15] <kline> of course, this is happening in china too, we just see it less
[10:38:29] <dimadima> i thoroughly envision multinational feudalism as the human future
[10:38:45] <dimadima> people align themselves and become serfs to megacorps
[10:38:49] <kline> tencent is like facebook (or meta) in china
[10:39:17] <dimadima> the struggle between tech and nation is the big thing for me
[10:39:48] <dimadima> but you think china will subdue its tech
[10:39:58] <dimadima> jack ma etc
[10:40:02] <kline> china already does, far more effectively
[10:40:06] <kline> jack ma is fairly outlier
[10:40:28] <kline> tencent is imo the one to watch
[10:40:34] <dimadima> we're roaring into the dystopian future!
[10:41:09] <kline> but basically all the chinese tech megacorps (and all chinese large businesses generally) are in bed (whether they want to or not) with the govt
[10:42:26] *** Quits: n3t (n3t@user/n3t) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[10:42:42] <dimadima> we'll see we'll see
[10:42:43] <kline> china will also fall in the end
[10:42:50] <kline> but we'll see what sticks
[10:42:52] <dimadima> well of course everything falls
[10:43:31] <kline> but in the meantime i can see 500 years of sinodominance starting from maybe 2100
[10:44:01] <dimadima> to what extent do you think that perspective may be tainted by current events
[10:44:04] <kline> in the words of the wall street greats though: "ibgybg"
[10:44:11] <dimadima> like in the late 80s it was all japan japan
[10:44:11] *** Joins: n3t (n3t@s45.mydevil.net)
[10:45:06] <kline> its worth remembering that japan was considered an industrial powerhouse but definitely under the western hegemony
[10:45:33] <dimadima> well yeah
[10:45:34] <kline> japan going rogue and casting off the west was unlikely to ever happen, and it was mainly a domestic thing
[10:45:34] <dimadima> that's true
[10:45:51] <kline> china however has extensive foreign policy programmes that have been effective for years
[10:45:52] <dimadima> they were still bound by pacifism for one thing
[10:46:16] <kline> china is taming africa and they're well on the way with the middle east
[10:46:21] <dimadima> it just seems very 2018-2021 to say
[10:46:21] <kline> see the belt and road initiative
[10:46:28] <dimadima> "500 years of sinodominance starting from maybe 2100"
[10:47:04] <kline> meanwhile their growth into the south china sea and i think eventual enforcement of the 9DL probably has long-term legs
[10:47:26] <kline> dimadima, if the west was showing any kind of intention of standing up, id be much more optimistic, but i dont think its true
[10:48:46] <dimadima> we're talking about 20 year stretches here
[10:48:53] <dimadima> in 20 years france went from being totall broke
[10:49:07] <dimadima> and not even able to enforce its hegemony over flanders
[10:49:12] <dimadima> to rolling into russia
[10:49:17] <kline> how did that go?
[10:49:24] <dimadima> that last bit went badly
[10:49:28] <kline> m
[10:49:34] <dimadima> but until then it was pretty remarkable
[10:51:36] <kline> id like to see some action
[10:51:48] <kline> but i dont think such action will happen
[10:52:05] <dimadima> i'd like to see some action happen in education
[10:52:05] <kline> the most obvious place for it to happen, ukraine, has already been ruled out even
[10:52:17] <dimadima> the west needs something to defend
[10:52:22] <kline> what would you like to see in education?
[10:52:23] <dimadima> and that ought not be netflix, in my mind
[10:52:44] <dimadima> like, people learning how to read and write well
[10:53:04] <dimadima> we need to have stuff to defend that isn't the right to own guns
[10:53:09] <dimadima> but something more than that
[10:53:26] <dimadima> but in the US it seems like increasingly all people have to defend is nothing
[10:53:29] <kline> i dont think that has much to to do with this, short of china deciding to invade the US
[10:53:32] <kline> which wont happen
[10:53:32] <dimadima> which i think is the big underyling problem
[10:54:19] <dimadima> people like james rebanks in england are defending their lifestyles
[10:54:23] <dimadima> for example
[10:54:23] <kline> i think the US will mostly settle on returning to insularity, as has generally been the trend, for quite some time
[10:54:36] <dimadima> i think that's more worthwhile than defending the south china sea
[10:54:58] <dimadima> i wouldn't equate that with weakness?
[10:54:59] <kline> the US was very slow to enter WWI and WWII for example, otherwise quite happy to let the rest of the world do its thing and just sit the drama out unless it was directly impacted
[10:55:13] <dimadima> unless they don't have people reading and writing
[10:55:21] <dimadima> then we'll be weak and shitty
[10:56:56] <dimadima> it's definitely a shame we've left ukraine
[10:57:01] <dimadima> that's weird
[10:57:05] <kline> its not though
[10:57:13] <kline> its been the pattern for some time
[10:57:26] <dimadima> you'd think there would be lines you'd draw
[10:57:35] <dimadima> ukraine is a _great_ thing to defend
[10:57:40] <dimadima> unlike every other thing we've engaged in
[10:57:51] <dimadima> there's not a better conflict to be involved with
[10:57:56] <dimadima> 1) they'll fight for themselves
[10:58:02] <dimadima> 2) they'll even fly for themselves!
[10:58:13] <dimadima> 3) others would join
[10:58:18] <dimadima> (poland, baltic states)
[10:58:23] <kline> but the line wasnt drawn with crimea, 7 years ago
[10:58:30] <dimadima> crimea is different in my mind
[10:58:38] <dimadima> in my mind it belongs to russia culturally and historically
[10:58:50] <kline> so did ukraine
[10:58:54] <dimadima> different
[10:59:01] <dimadima> ukraine was always trying to get out from under russia
[10:59:06] <dimadima> they didn't go easy in the 1920s
[10:59:10] <dimadima> at all
[10:59:18] <dimadima> and many times before that
[10:59:46] <dimadima> 4) the whole fucking cold war
[10:59:59] <dimadima> like, are you seriously goign to lose the cold war after "Winning" it lol
[11:00:23] <dimadima> i could go on
[11:00:35] <dimadima> ukraine isn't the middle east and it's not asia
[11:00:44] <dimadima> dumb dumb dumb
[11:01:12] <dimadima> poland should be getting involved with ukraine now
[11:01:25] <dimadima> is NATO not going to do anything either?
[11:01:34] <dimadima> if neither the US nor NATO does anything, then it's the end of NATO
[11:01:35] <kline> ukraine isnt a nato member
[11:01:42] <dimadima> doesn't matter really
[11:01:48] <dimadima> it's a member of 'europe'
[11:01:52] <kline> nato is a self defence pact
[11:01:55] <dimadima> a democratic member of europe
[11:02:00] <kline> you cant article five another country
[11:02:13] <dimadima> i didn't mean strictly speaking in legal terms
[11:02:26] <dimadima> i mean in power projection terms
[11:02:36] <dimadima> not even power but solvency projection
[11:02:41] <kline> nato isnt going to do anything
[11:02:46] <dimadima> yeah
[11:02:51] <dimadima> we'll see if putin does this
[11:02:54] <dimadima> it's going to be a big war
[11:02:58] <dimadima> if he does
[11:03:02] <kline> with who?
[11:03:06] <dimadima> with the ukranian people
[11:03:17] <dimadima> they're going to figh
[11:03:20] <dimadima> fight
[11:03:56] <dimadima> i think they will
[11:03:57] <kline> itll be interesting to see how russia does in a 21st century conventional war
[11:04:10] <dimadima> it'll be asymmetric
[11:04:13] <kline> but i dont think itll be conventional in any but the most easy areas
[11:04:14] <kline> yeah
[11:04:16] <dimadima> but there will be an ongoing insurgency
[11:04:22] <dimadima> it'll not be chechnya
[11:04:27] <kline> i mean
[11:04:32] <kline> itll be donbass
[11:04:35] <kline> but the whole country
[11:04:36] <dimadima> much more
[11:04:42] <dimadima> donbass is mostly russian people
[11:04:52] <dimadima> once they get into ethnic ukranian lands
[11:04:55] <dimadima> it's going to be no joke
[11:05:35] <dimadima> it's hard to think about i can't imagine it
[11:05:49] <kline> where is it youre from?
[11:05:53] <dimadima> they're going to fight a bit and the it'll be a lengthy insurgency
[11:06:08] <dimadima> i'm from ukraine
[11:06:16] <kline> i figured
[11:06:20] <dimadima> but i'm not ukranian
[11:06:25] <kline> you know more about this than the other flashpoints
[11:06:36] <kline> are you ethnic russian or what?
[11:06:47] <kline> just a visitor?
[11:06:50] <dimadima> i'm jewish, which is a nationality there
[11:06:54] <kline> oh, fair
[11:07:08] <dimadima> (and many other places lol)
[11:07:51] <kline> well, yes, bad news, the west is going to do nothing for ukraine, good luck
[11:08:05] <dimadima> it'll be a senseless exercise
[11:08:15] <dimadima> also they'll provide them with weapons i'd think
[11:08:16] <kline> i have a friend i knew when i was at the military academy who was from lviv and i hope he's going to be ok, mostly
[11:08:22] <dimadima> they already are
[11:08:49] <dimadima> hehe mostly
[11:09:04] <dimadima> i've seen my share of ukraine/russia war videos
[11:09:21] <dimadima> it would be crazy if they expanded it

[18:24:24] <Brekkjern> We only get grades from the exams. I'll just have to take it later.

[18:30:33] <Brekkjern> indigo: There's no need to worry at all. If I don't get a valid exemption from this exam I will still only need to take it again later, but I would have used one of my chances.

[18:31:43] <gerikson> so, if you did have covid, you'd have to hie yoursefl to a healthcare provider, spreading infection all the way, just to get a note saying you're exempt form the exam?
[18:32:02] <Brekkjern> It seems they have finally changed that page and removed the requirement for documentation on physical exams
[18:32:15] <gerikson> fuck yeah
[18:32:20] <indigo> Oh wow!!! You get attempts??
[18:32:30] <Brekkjern> gerikson: No, I would have a positive covid test to show. That would be documentation enough
[18:32:39] <gerikson> fake one ;)
[18:32:47] <Brekkjern> lolno :P
[18:33:16] <indigo> This is super awesome; at my uni you only got one attempt per test
[18:33:33] <indigo> if you failed you just needed to retake the class later
[18:33:49] <indigo> Or, if you couldn’t make it
[18:34:26] <Brekkjern> You have to pass the class to be allowed to take the exam. Passing just means handing in all obligatory tasks and getting a pass on them.
[18:34:41] <Brekkjern> If you have passed the class, you can attempt the exam up to 3 times.
[18:34:48] <dimadima> wow
[18:34:53] <dimadima> that is a cool system
[18:35:00] <dimadima> and they take the highest grade, or?

[21:33:45] <manicennui> It seems like we create JWT tokens, and then everything just checks that the token is "valid", but I don't see anything checking whether it has expired, and nothing contacts the system that keeps track of whether they have been revoked.
[21:34:12] <manicennui> Logging out is achieved by telling the browser to delete certain cookies and then telling the server that generates the token to revoke it.
[21:34:39] <manicennui> But since nothing ever asks that server whether the token has been revoked, it really boils down to whether the browser keeps it in its cookies.
[21:39:03] <manicennui> There is a separate expiration time for the session that is not part of the token...
