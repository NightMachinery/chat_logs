[05:02:02] <Hello72> ssh-rsa is unfortunately both the name of a key type and a key exchange protocol
[05:02:34] <MacGyver> Your existing ssh RSA keys should work just fine for rsa-sha2-256 and 512.

[14:44:34] <kode54> um
[14:44:44] <kode54> msys2 merged a pr that switched to ubuntu keyserver last year
[14:44:49] <maxzor> I'd guess that pacman has handled sks shutdown in a timely manner
[14:44:50] <MacGyver> The issue isn't arch.
[14:45:07] <MacGyver> The issue is also not pacman, because it works for arch.
[14:45:15] <maxzor> okay, thank you
[14:45:18] <MacGyver> So, by the process of elimination, you're barking up the wrong tree.
[14:45:28] <MacGyver> You might find msys developers in the pacman channel though.
[14:45:35] <kode54> I had no idea that it just worked for arch
[14:45:43] <MacGyver> But doesn't msys just *have* a channel?
[14:45:44] <kode54> I manually configured all my installations to use the ubuntu server ages ago
[14:46:24] <MacGyver> kode54: Upstream gpg did that themselves a while ago, which is probably why it works.

[22:41:30] <Itaru> Is it possible to extract a specific file from a 7zip file to stdout? Using Archive Manager I'm able to extract specific files, but is there a similar way to do that in the commandline?
[22:42:52] <Itaru> I have a few giant log files that are all 7zipped together, and just extracting the entire archive to stdout (and thus every single file inside it) to grep the actual values I need takes forever.

[22:43:39] <Itaru> Each log is about 25GB~, and I have over 4 of them. Shaving off 75GB of unnecessary extraction would speed things up a lot
