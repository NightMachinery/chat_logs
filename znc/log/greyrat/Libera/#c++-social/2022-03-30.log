[00:20:40] <MaNI> germany should pay the entire world reparations for creating SAP
[00:24:06] <T`aZ> ha, gcc6 , how lucky
[00:28:41] <TheFlash> I have no idea what SAP does. And I probably want to keep it that way.
[00:30:27] <T`aZ> probably everything, and nothing at the same time, all while requiring consultants payed 2500â‚¬/day and 128GB of memory per concurrent user access
[00:36:59] <MaNI> exactly that
[00:38:13] <TheFlash> Can I become SAP consultant without knowing what SAP does?
[00:38:26] <T`aZ> probably
[00:38:34] <MaNI> I think its a requirement
[00:38:35] <T`aZ> youll get 2 weeks training to become an expert
[00:38:41] <Faux> SAP is merely a market leading ERP system!
[00:38:43] <TheFlash> That 2500EUR/day sounds nice. But I still prefer not knowing what SAP does.
[00:39:05] <T`aZ> TheFlash: ha, 2500 is what it costs the customer, not at all what will go inot your pocket
[00:39:37] <TheFlash> Faux: Information value of that sentence is close to zero :)
[00:39:52] <Faux> Of course. I don't know either.
[00:40:16] <Faux> I think it was my lowest scoring assessed work at uni, we had to study for some case studies and the one that actually came up on the exam was SAP or ERP.
[00:40:23] <Faux> And I had absolutely no idea what it was.
[00:40:40] <Faux> And yes, I had studied the case study about as hard as the other case studies.
[00:40:48] <Raziel> a case study about erotic roleplay?
[00:40:55] <Faux> The best degree.
[00:41:22] <Faux> https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/12/ERP_Modules.png
[00:41:37] <T`aZ> not sure i wannt click that
[00:41:43] <Faux> > Most ERP systems incorporate best practices.
[00:41:49] <Raziel> Faux, to be fair, plm is a common romanian abbreviation meaning "my dick"
[00:41:57] <Raziel> so, I can still see how that's erotic roleplay.
[00:42:08] <T`aZ> buzzwords overflow

[21:30:11] <Faux> imdb is good, but not linear. If it's 8+ on imdb it's probably bad, unless it's a classic.
[21:30:25] <Faux> 7 is a good thriller, 6 is a good action movie.
[21:30:39] <Faux> If an action movie is over 6, it's not actually an action movie, etc.
