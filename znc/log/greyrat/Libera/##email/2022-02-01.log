[15:44:05] <pj> ...and no issue with IPv6 here
[15:46:21] <Khepra> dunno, I had no IPv6 routing from several places inside EU, mtr showing cutoff deep into sunet.se network, a the edge of irc.libera.chat.   neway... by "listed" IP, I meant listed on RBLs like those monitored by mxtoolbox, for example.
[15:47:07] <Khepra> in other words, it make sense that if an IPv4 is listed, your deliverability suffers. But what if it's not listed? I have one IPv4, and this week the MX will migrate to another server, another IPv4. 
[15:48:25] <pj> Khepra: it stands to reason that *not* being listed in a DNSRBL is a good thing.
[15:48:57] <Khepra> yeah but in the past I heard stories, and have seen for myself, a dip in deliverability if you changed your outbound IPv4
[15:49:10] <pj> That said, there is such a thing as IP reputation which is different from being listed in a DNSRBL.
[15:49:15] <Khepra> even if everything about it looks legit. FCRDNS, SPF, DKIM, ...
[15:49:42] <pj> IP reputation is generally tracked by individual ESPs, so at the end of the day you will have to build it up again.
[15:50:17] <Khepra> and that's what I'm asking. Is that even a factor any more, what with so many cloudy services using a plethora of very fragmented IPv4 ranges
[15:50:18] <pj> You can help to speed up the process by listing your IP on dnswl.org
[15:50:22] <pj> !dnswl
[15:50:23] <dig-dug> pj: dnswl: (#1) http://www.dnswl.org The DNS Whitelist protects against false positives from known good senders., or (#2) dnswl.org has a channel on freenode, #dnswl.org
[15:50:30] <Khepra> already listed
[15:50:44] <pj> Khepra: yes, that's a factor.
[15:50:47] <Khepra> haven't seen any effect, to be honest
[15:50:50] <pj> hrmmmmm
[15:51:20] <pj> !forget dnswl 2
[15:51:21] <dig-dug> pj: ok
[15:51:25] <pj> !dnswl
[15:51:27] <dig-dug> pj: dnswl: http://www.dnswl.org The DNS Whitelist protects against false positives from known good senders.
[15:52:07] <Atque> Isn't having freenode channels bad?
[15:52:24] <Atque> (Is the project safe)
[15:52:41] <Khepra> well in our spam filtering, we don't care wht the IP is, except for "is it listed in the RBLs". Yes? points toward spam. No? Shrug.  So if your SMTP/outbound changed IPv4, our SMTPd wouldn't care one bit, unless RBL. I would assume the big ESPs following the same logic becuse indiviaul IPv4 is meaningless, _except_ when proven spammy and RBListed
[15:53:49] <Khepra> at the end of the day, I'm so tired and I don't care, really :) if anyone has problems, go to friggin gsuite or o365, and leave me alone :))

[16:43:43] <tuxick> heh, got /48 at home :)
[16:44:35] <tuxick> no idea why
[16:47:33] <Khepra> because humans have problems with large numbers. at some point certain size of N seems like "infinite" and gets inefficiently dealt with. wasted
[16:48:34] <Khepra> and then a 100 years later, someone, somewhere on an interplanetary registry for internet numbers conference, presents a paper with a simple premise: "Oops, we did it again." Britney'n'all.
[16:52:36] <tuxick> hehe ye
[16:53:03] <tuxick> reminds me of the insanely large GET strings you see a lot
[16:53:19] <tuxick> large enough to address a single electron in the universe
[16:53:25] <lunaphyte> a /48 assignment is correct
[16:53:31] <lunaphyte> that's as it should be
[16:53:34] <Khepra> correct for what?
[16:53:39] <tuxick> why so big?
[16:53:50] <lunaphyte> it's not about "big" or "small"
[16:53:57] <Khepra> welp, the IPv6 training I got says /64 is default assignment. 56 and 48 is "reserved" for large providers and RIRs
[16:54:11] <tuxick> that was last year!
[16:54:20] <tuxick> try to keep up!
[16:54:37] <Khepra> that was some RIPE sponsored training we got few years ago, a two week course into IPv6
[16:55:11] <Khepra> and taht's really what I mostly see in the wild. /64 is given by hosting companies to clients. the companies themselves registering ASNs with 56 and 48 large subnets
[16:55:11] <lunaphyte> as per rfc 3177 and 6177, a /48 is used in virtually all cases.  a /64 is reserved for edge cases, where it is prescribed that there shall only ever be a single subnet
[16:56:01] <Khepra> I have my doubts that rfc is up to date :)
[16:56:18] <lunaphyte> i'm not sure what you mean
[16:56:33] <lunaphyte> it is the specification in the rfc which is up to date
[16:56:37] <Khepra> I mean over the years there have been different allocation "standards" proposed
[16:57:35] <lunaphyte> the specification defined in the rfc is the current standard
[16:57:52] <Friithian> what we need is a new standard
[16:57:59] <Khepra> second para of the 6177, section Introduction, seems to agree that 48 is old assignment, now revised
[16:58:05] <lunaphyte> whether or not it is ignored is another matter, and doesn't impact it's status as a standard, until another rfc is published
[16:59:40] <lunaphyte> oh, i'll have to have a look again
[17:00:17] <Khepra> the RFC says it's just a recommendation
[17:00:59] <bookworm> you need more than a /64 else you can't subnet. And even household customers should be able to do that
[17:01:55] <Khepra> what do you mean "can't subnet"
[17:02:52] <bookworm> all stateless pick your ipv6 based on mac or whatever then search for a router want the last 64 bits for the host iirc
[17:03:11] <bookworm> you should not have to use dhcp anymore
[17:03:21] <lunaphyte> why?
[17:03:33] <bookworm> because it makes networking easier?
[17:03:39] <lunaphyte> that's too vague
[17:03:50] <lunaphyte> dhcp still has a place in the world of ipv6
[17:04:04] <Khepra> with RA and other goodies, DHCP lost meaning, I agree. And yet, someone thought DHCP6 was needed..... :/
[17:04:07] <bookworm> yes, so does NAT. Yet people advise against it
[17:04:39] <bookworm> you can use a horse to get from A to B, or a car. Both in the end bring you from A to B
[17:04:53] <bookworm> yet you do have a preference, no?
[17:04:54] <Khepra> then again DHCP has other things. dns, clocks, what else....    RA and DAD are just for routing and obtaining of the IP
[17:04:59] <lunaphyte> router advertisments don't provide for autoconfiguration of things other than address space and gateways
[17:05:56] <bookworm> you don't really need local DNS servers. Devices can find each other locally
[17:06:11] <Khepra> bookworm: but mac based SLAAC requires less bits than the size of /64, so you _can_ subnet
[17:06:53] <lunaphyte> i think it's time to bring this back closer to the channel /topic
