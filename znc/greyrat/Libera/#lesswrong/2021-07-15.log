[05:04:51] <gwern> you're using it for the wrong thing. _Space Dandy_ taught us that yogurt is the perfect cure for zombies, as they thirst to devour the living, and what has more millions of living lifeforms per cubic millimeter than fresh delicious tangy yogurt?

[05:15:21] <ggreer> had my second encounter with a crazy homeless person yesterday. both times have been while running, which is the only time I'm not carrying. so I started looking into concealed carry setups for running, and the technology has gotten way better in the past few years
[05:15:48] <ggreer> still, 2 encounters in 9 months is way better than my experience in the bay area (and *way* better than my experience in portland)
[05:16:08] <feep> I have met a crazy homeless person, I think once
[05:16:09] <feep> in total
[05:16:14] <saturn2> can you just run with a gun in each hand
[05:16:30] <feep> gun in each hand, finger on the trigger, approach my surroundings at your peril
[05:17:15] <ggreer> sadly washington concealed pistol licenses mean *concealed* and only one pistol
[05:18:04] <ggreer> also if the gun is in your hand and there is no threat around, that's probably brandishing
[05:18:22] <gwern> I've been accosted by crazy homeless people here, but only while in DC. I was meeting someone at the Amtrak, and holy shit, one dude would just not leave us alone
[05:18:40] <gwern> interestingly, in DC they are all black, but in SF it was much more diverse
[05:19:21] <gwern> in Oxford, one homeless dude lectured us while we waited for the bus. he was white. actually, I think all the homeless in oxford were white
[05:19:28] <gwern> the old woman who tried to con me was white too
[05:19:29] <saturn2> isn't DC almost 90% black
[05:19:38] <gwern> saturn2: depends on the area, but yeah
[05:20:09] <gwern> I'm not sure about the amtrak station because that's in the government/downtown area within walking of the capitol etc. I'd assume that would all be super-gentrified and white
[05:20:23] <ggreer> I've only seen like 3 homeless people in vancouver (as in... looking disheveled and walking around stuff. I'm sure if you look at the actual stats a bunch of people live in their cars)
[05:20:44] <gwern> (this was the old woman who tried the 'I need train/taxi fare home' scam on me, twice. I was so insulted. it was only like a few nights in between too)
[05:21:20] <Betawolf> it's like you don't mean anything to her
[05:23:16] <gwern> Betawolf: no, it was, "it's worse than a crime, it's a mistake!"
[05:23:28] <gwern> she was wasting her time on me when she could be trying to scam a fresh mark!
[05:23:40] <gwern> take some pride in your work dammit
[05:24:39] <saturn2> no one actually believes those stories anyway
[05:25:31] <kuudes> lectured you? are you sure it was a homeless person and not just a professor in the wild?
[05:26:40] <Betawolf> can be hard to tell
[05:26:52] <gwern> well, he ranted about how he was not invisible and we should look at him. I'd expect a professor would be quite tired of his students looking at him during class, so probably homeless
[05:27:14] <gwern> and he was entirely too young looking to be a professor unless oxford's standards have seriously slipped

[08:46:17] <quanticle> If there's one thing I know about "historic" buildings, it's that the prettier they are to look at, the more annoying they are to work in, because the designers perfectly adapted the building to their time and their needs, and didn't leave any consideration for nice things like electricity, indoor plumbing, air conditioning, or wifi.
[08:47:27] <feep> eh. I think we're pretty good about staying on top of that.
[08:47:35] <quanticle> So whenever I see a city government domiciled in an old castle or some other historic relic, I immediately feel sorry for everyone working there, especially the IT folks who have to deal with getting network access through like... 30cm thick solid stone walls
[08:47:37] <feep> and solid stone buildings are pretty good at managing heat generally

[08:52:25] <rmmh> that's about it
[08:55:11] <rmmh> about the best you can hope for is that the walls will be the moving average temperature of the last few weeks, but they don't solve the problem of humidity, and the thermal mass makes actively heating or cooling the space much more expensive
[08:57:06] <feep> that's true
[08:57:59] <rmmh> stone is pretty thermally conductive, so you end up having to add insulation and another wall to make it more liveable
[09:01:17] <rmmh> the less romantic stone construction is brutalist concrete apartment blocks
[09:03:04] <rmmh> high efficiency modern construction is all about making extremely airtight buildings with good insulation
[09:03:54] <saturn2> does the thermal mass make it more expensive to heat or cool if there's the same amount of insulation?
[09:04:08] <quanticle> And then putting in air exchangers, because you made the buildings *too* airtight
[09:04:25] <rmmh> quanticle: fans are cheap
[09:04:40] <rmmh> saturn2: more expensive, because stone is much more thermally conductive than air

[13:43:11] <shawwwn> okay so
[13:43:39] <shawwwn> we were reading over the longest prison sentences in history, because why not. who has the high score?
[13:43:55] <shawwwn> turns out it's someone who built a truck bomb with mcveigh. he was sentenced to 175 thousand years
[13:44:21] <shawwwn> so I was reading over his wikipedia page (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_Nichols) and of course, I got to:
[13:44:26] <shawwwn> > Nichols began purchasing large quantities of ammonium nitrate fertilizer and storing it in three rental storage units
[13:44:32] <feepbot> Terry Lynn Nichols (born April 1, 1955) is an American domestic terrorist who was convicted of being an accomplice in the Oklahoma City bombing. Prior to his incarceration, he held a variety of short-term jobs, working as a farmer, grain elevator manager, real estate salesman and ranch hand.
[13:44:55] <shawwwn> I go "of friggin course", because somewhere in my mind, ammonium nitrate fertilizer is apparently the go-to homemade explosive for like, every terrorist ever
[13:45:13] <shawwwn> so that got me curious. exactly how large of a quantity is a large quantity?

[13:46:21] <shawwwn> emily was like "no way you can do anything with a gallon bucket though, right?"

[16:14:29] <kuudes> hmm. in remote work, should income taxes be decided by the employee or employer place of residence?
[16:17:04] <Nivim> Different incentives for each, but going by employee seems like it would result in less horribly unfair situations. There are already a lot of problems with corporations exploiting the laws of where they're headquartered even when that's not where they create consequences which need laws applied.
[16:18:05] <Nivim> (Although if it was consistently different places for each advantage they might have, it could get more concessions out of them by having to pick and choose.)
[16:19:09] <PapuaHardyNet> so does the employer pay the tax or is it the employee's job to do so?
[16:19:21] <kuudes> at least it would be useful if the tax office would offer a gross payment service, where they employer would pay the gross sum to the tax office, which would then pay the mandatory pension insurance costs and take income taxes and give the net to the employee
[16:19:24] <nshepperd2> countries that care about this make treaties with each other about which one gets the taxes
[16:19:35] <kuudes> PapuaHardyNet, both
[16:20:36] <kuudes> nshepperd2, that is true
[16:20:49] <Nivim> Harsh bureaucracy costs for that batch tax idea, though. It would take quite some years to iron out quite that many kinks.
[16:21:21] <kuudes> what do you mean?
[16:22:16] <nshepperd2> usually the result is that you have to pay the max of both income taxes, with the country that you are in getting first dibs and the other country getting the leftovers
[16:22:25] <kuudes> yes
[16:22:44] <kuudes> worst case is that you just have to pay both taxes, which could take it >100%
[16:23:03] <PapuaHardyNet> at that point one should just work for free
[16:23:14] <Nivim> It's basically creating a back-and-forth between government, company, and employee which is short on precedent and doesn't align with the proceedures of how tax is already handled; sounds like a good way for there to be a lot of cracks for people to fall through, where they can lose their entire pay and not be able to address that.
[16:23:33] <Nivim> (This is before the concept of multiple countries comes in.)
[16:24:55] <kuudes> over here we have a government web service through which you can pay salary to your babysitter etc and it calculates automatically the necessary fees to different parties and you can select the insurance company etc and it just makes e-bills for you
[16:25:19] <PapuaHardyNet> question: why not just pay your babysitter directly?
[16:25:38] <kuudes> then you are liable for doing those all by yourself, and lose the tax credits
[16:25:46] *** Parts: Mark_ (~mkosmatri@2001:470:69fc:105::625) ()
[16:25:51] <kuudes> and babysitter does not get their due benefits
[16:26:05] <kuudes> and they could out you for a crime
[16:26:08] <PapuaHardyNet> benefits from the government because of paying taxes?
[16:26:27] <kuudes> unemployment, pension etc are based on your wage incomes
[16:27:13] <PapuaHardyNet> pension isn't paid by the government: they just enforce it, right?
[16:27:24] <kuudes> ~ its complicated
[16:27:36] <PapuaHardyNet> and unemployment benefits - surely they don't scale based on what you've been recently earning. that would be surprisingly unfair
[16:27:42] <kuudes> yes they do
[16:27:46] <PapuaHardyNet> :(
[16:28:06] <kuudes> it is something like 50% up to about median salary and 20% for over that and base of 900 or so
[16:28:31] <PapuaHardyNet> oh, they scale inversely
[16:28:35] <PapuaHardyNet> that's all right
[16:28:45] <PapuaHardyNet> so the more you have been earning, the less you get as benefits
[16:28:48] <kuudes> no, higher wage -> higher unemployment benefit
[16:29:15] <PapuaHardyNet> all right
[16:29:16] <kuudes> engineers get larger unemployment insurance benefit than waiters etc, if they have higher salary
[16:29:53] <PapuaHardyNet> so involving the government is beneficial to all parties, it seems
[16:30:08] <PapuaHardyNet> for your government I mean. Happy for you guys
[16:34:50] <kuudes> there was a paper from bank of finland that higher trust in social insurance seems to lead to leaner markets because savings rate of people drops and there is less variance of money supply from that

[19:13:21] <gwern> it's one of those quiet security-by-obscurity measures the US takes. the same way that ordering certain glassware or chemicals will earn you a place on watchlists, or tinkering with certain biology things a visit from a g-man for a "being god is a lot of responsibility, timmy" lecture, or there are big unlabeled boxes sitting next to a lot of roads around NYC or DC apparently doing nothing
[19:13:39] <gwern> or locksmiths, or the invisible dots printed onto paper by your printer, or...
[19:19:01] <two2thehead> why locksmiths?

[19:24:49] <gwern> two2thehead: you don't see why *lock*smiths might do things that muggles might not expect?
[19:26:25] <two2thehead> Okay, so locksmiths being better than average at potentially committing crimes. That's more descriptive than just stating 'locksmiths'
[19:26:40] <dbohdan> gwern: I guess those things have two dimensions as countermeasures: preventative (ammonium additives are 100% this) and tracing -- making the crime easier to investigate should it occur (the invisible dots are mostly this, although knowing about them is preventative).  Watchlists are both.
[19:26:45] <RiversHaveWings> ...what is the security by obscurity measure, though?
[19:27:06] <gwern> two2thehead: I'm not super clear on the details of what locksmiths do, exactly. I just know they have stuff they do which the rest of us would be surprised to learn

[19:27:17] <gwern> it's not like it's my job to figure out their secrets
[19:28:19] <gwern> anyway, lots of examples. did you know USPS stamp/package booths have hidden cameras to photograph you? or that stuff like fertilizers doesn't just come with additives to impede explosiveness but special chemical tracer mixes for tagging origin? similar to the programs for covertly collecting soil/ore samples from everywhere, for things like measuring isotopic ratios of radioactive fallout or...

[19:31:06] <gwern> shawwwn: it's amusing you think I'm makingany of this up. I know much of this from my DNM and other work. and the fertilizer stuff was very well known in the wake of oklahoma, which you were just reading about
[19:31:42] <two2thehead> "Point-source pollution is easy to identify. As the name suggests, it comes from a single place. Nonpoint-source pollution is harder to identify and harder to address. It is pollution that comes from many places, all at once."
[19:31:46] <gwern> oklahoma was a *huge* deal back then, as no one could dream of stuff like 9/11, and a lot happened in response to it

[21:22:24] <shawwwn> it's pretty nuts that a model trained on image classification by text prompts can be reverse gradient'd to draw something akin to bigfoot when prompted with "cryptozoology" 
[21:23:31] <gwern> it's not image classification, and classifiers have been able to hallucinate images forever. it's been done as a stunt since at least like 2014

[21:27:55] <shawwwn> we did one day hash out a plan for something like this, by training a GAN on GPT-2 tokenized labels
[21:28:17] <shawwwn> but having a classifier with a text prompt, making equivalently interesting images to an explicitly trained GAN? it's nuts

[23:14:36] <gwern> afidegnum: have you noticed you don't ask very good questions, and so you don't get very helpful replies?
[23:15:00] <afidegnum> hmm... 
[23:15:08] <Gurkenglas> afidegnum, ah. You're trying to "fine-tune" GPT-2. This jargon will help you because now you can go google "how to fine-tune gpt2"
[23:15:11] <afidegnum> how do i rephrase the question pls?
[23:15:54] <afidegnum> so "file-tune multiple text files with GPT-2" ?
[23:16:39] <afidegnum> Gurkenglas: what's the difference between fine-tuning an training ?
[23:16:55] <afidegnum> *and
[23:17:06] <Betawolf> your subject-object order is all out of whack
[23:17:27] <Gurkenglas> It's quite reasonable for you to confusedly describe what you're trying to do so we can tell you what it's called. You should make that your goal when formulating your question.
[23:17:41] <gwern> training is finetuning you don't care about
[23:17:48] <Gurkenglas> gwern's trolling.
[23:18:03] <gwern> my last two comments are 100% serious
[23:19:47] <gwern> afidegnum does not ask good questions, and commits the usual sin of defining their own jargon and leaping to asking 'how do I X' when they should be asking 'I want Y'. and the only difference between training and finetuning is whether you desire that particular distribution/domain. one man's finetuning is another man's training and vice-versa.
[23:20:27] <gwern> in much more important news, Alphafold2 *finally* dropped!

[23:20:40] <Betawolf> sweet proteins
[23:20:57] <Gurkenglas> afidegnum, training weakly indicates that the model one starts with is untrained. fine-tuning is when you take a trained model and continue to train it. All training is assumed to work with multiple examples, so it was confusing that you mentioned "multiple text files" as though you were doing something with multiple text files beyond using each of them in turn
[23:21:10] <gwern> https://github.com/deepmind/alphafold
[23:21:32] <dbohdan> Does an open source AlphaFold have global risk implications?
[23:21:32] <feepbot> GitHub - deepmind/alphafold: Open source code for AlphaFold. Contribute to deepmind/alphafold development by creating an account on GitHub.
[23:22:06] <Gurkenglas> (also, for fine-tuning one usually uses a different dataset that the one used for pretraining.) (pretraining is the training that comes before fine-tuning.)
[23:22:37] <Betawolf> there's a risk of some great biomedical advances, which I guess includes the possibility of some fancy new plagues and such
[23:24:23] <Gurkenglas> it's okay to ask how you've misunderstood a definition, but when you first hear a new term you should google it instead of asking what it is, because google is pretty good at answering common questions and "what is X" is a more common question than "i think X is Y. how am i wrong?"
[23:25:52] <afidegnum> Thanks a lot for your clarifications. 
[23:26:10] <afidegnum> I didn't get it right at first, 
[23:26:20] <Gurkenglas> afidegnum, googling should be an automatic response to confusion. it should feel easy. make it take as few keystrokes as possible, and try to solve any aversions you have to it. see https://www.gwern.net/Search#preparation
[23:26:31] <feepbot> Internet Search Tips ¬∑ Gwern.net (A description of advanced tips and tricks for effective Internet research of papers/books.)
[23:26:40] <dbohdan> Betawolf: Yeah, fancy new plagues are what I had in mind
[23:28:31] <afidegnum> so if i understand correctly, GPT-2 comes with  124M to 772M untrained dataset. am i correct ?
[23:32:13] <Gurkenglas> afidegnum, I don't understand the question. What is an untrained dataset? 124 million... bytes? characters?
[23:32:47] <gwern> it sounds like he's confusing it with parameters
[23:33:00] <gwern> (which is also wrong because gpt-2 comes in 1500m-parameter flavor too)
[23:33:20] <afidegnum> ouch!
[23:33:51] <Gurkenglas> yeah usually "XYZM" means parameters. *googles* 124M, 355M, 744M and 1.5B are the parameter sizes of the 4 released GPT-2 models.
[23:34:17] <Gurkenglas> (which are trained.)
[23:34:34] <Gurkenglas> so i still dont know what you mean by untrained dataset, if anything :P
[23:35:59] <afidegnum> ok, i'm getting it now
[23:36:32] <afidegnum> so it's those parameters that needs to be fine-tuned, righ t?
[23:37:14] <ggreer> how would you use alphafold to help engineer a new plague? first you'd have to identify one or more receptors in the human body that you want to interact with (eg: bind to some part of... ACHE so that people don't break down acetylcholine and quickly become paralyzed and die)
[23:37:20] <ggreer> then you'd have to run alphafold a *lot* to figure out what amino acid chains would do the job. then you'd create an RNA sequence for that, and maybe a DNA sequence if you wanted the pathogen to stick around longer in the environment
[23:37:25] <Gurkenglas> afidegnum, type error. parameters are not the thing you fine-tune. ask again after reading the definitions.

[23:40:04] <feep> I fucking love lesswrong
[23:40:05] <Betawolf> it'd still be pretty slow to be sure, and nowhere like as easy as just using an existing disease, but it's still progress
[23:40:05] <ggreer> seems like most of the heavy lifting is done by trying to figure out what to target. if you could give a neural network a bunch of biology textbooks and ask, "how do I fuck shit up?", it'd probably be way worse for the future than any alphafold stuff
[23:40:24] <feep> someone posts "An Analysis of the Provenance of the Book of Mormon (with Bayesian Math)"
[23:40:26] <Gurkenglas> actually, i should be less harsh about that one. models are, by jargon, the thing you fine-tune. "parameters" is often read as "parameter counts", and training doesn't change the number of parameters. but training does change the parameters, so i suppose one can say that the parameters are being fine-tuned.
[23:40:35] <feep> and the comments section immediately becomes an intense scholarly debate on the topic
[23:40:51] <kuudes> can we mix alphafold and gpt? to be able to say "cure for cancer" and get it to generate a peptide
[23:40:58] <feep> like, I think the analysis is rubbish but the reaction is amazing <3
[23:41:12] <dbohdan> "nowhere like as easy as just using an existing disease"  "seems like most of the heavy lifting is done by trying to figure out what to target"  Good points
[23:41:21] <Gurkenglas> kuudes, not so good when the xkcd that says that a gun cures cancer is in the dataset
[23:41:31] <kuudes> :D
[23:41:40] <kuudes> well it does not cure it, only kills it
[23:41:44] <ggreer> cancer isn't even a well defined thing. you want cells to reproduce. heck, a lot of diseases are because our cells don't reproduce enough
[23:42:20] <kuudes> well sure, but humanity's texts likely talk enough about it for "cure cancer" to be a meaningful meme
[23:43:02] <kuudes> but yes, I guess "subtle airborne plague that kills host 2 weeks after infection" is easier to define
[23:43:33] <ggreer> scariest thing would be a viral pathogen that creates a prion disease
[23:43:46] <ggreer> everyone would get infected before anyone started showing symptoms
[23:43:56] <kuudes> airborne prion...
[23:43:57] <dbohdan> True
[23:44:20] <kuudes> ...how do we know we don't already have such and alzheimer or something is just the final symptom
[23:44:49] <Gurkenglas> especially not so good if gpt predicts on a high level a 9:1 chance of actual cure peptide vs kill agent peptide, and then 99.9% of runs diverge when it trying to make an actual cure, and 90% of runs diverge when it tries to make a kill agent, and then you outcome pump on not diverging
[23:44:50] <ggreer> because prion diseases manifest much faster than that
[23:45:14] <kuudes> doens't cjd take decades?
[23:46:32] <dbohdan> gwern: I had to check whether it was real.  It is.  '‚Äù‚ÄòShark attack‚Äô is a lie,‚Äù said University of Sydney language researcher Christopher Pepin-Neff, who argued that a majority of what people call ‚Äúattacks‚Äù are merely nips and minor injuries from smaller sharks.'  https://nypost.com/2021/07/15/shark-experts-insist-on-re-branding-attacks-as-shark-interactions/
[23:46:42] <feepbot> Shark experts insist on re-branding attacks as shark ‚Äúinteractions‚Äù (Marine advocates in Australia are urging the public to stop using "attack" in reference to sharks, saying that media has warped the reputation of the majestic predatory fish into that of a deliberate...)
[23:46:45] <gwern> 'mostly peaceful rips'
[23:47:48] <ggreer> no it takes months from onset to death. if the prions were accumulating throughout one's lifetime, symptoms would occur much sooner
[23:47:53] <Betawolf> they're just pissed that all the posers get to claim they were attacked by a shark without losing a limb or anything
[23:49:02] <Betawolf> half the people who claim to have suffered from a 'shark attack' haven't even seen Sharknado, it's just blatant subcultural appropriation.
[23:50:26] <afidegnum> so, can you please share some code that i can follow to be able to fine-tune my model from existing dataset made of custom text files? 
[23:50:40] <ggreer> anyway you'd engineer a retrovirus that injected the familial CJD gene (or the fatal insomnia gene) then wait a few years
[23:50:53] <Betawolf> can I address the question of why you have come to #lesswrong for text generation help?
[23:51:50] <afidegnum> I have been directed  from #machinelearning
[23:52:09] <kuudes> wait what
[23:52:34] <Betawolf> did we offend them somehow?

[23:54:59] <afidegnum> yes
[23:55:16] <PapuaHardyNet> unfortunately I doubt #lesswrong would be of much help
[23:55:26] <PapuaHardyNet> no offense, gentlemen
[23:55:54] <PapuaHardyNet> perhaps they meant someone specific here?
[23:56:24] <Gurkenglas> afidegnum, thats the sort of help that professionals make a lot of money with. your best bet is to get good at internet research. you know what, hop on a videocall with me, i'll direct you on how to do research.
[23:56:41] <ggreer> it occurs to me: why aren't many pathogens airborne? it seems like it would be the default. there are plenty of cell types along the respiratory tract. infecting any of them means that the person will shed some pathogen when breathing/sneezing/coughing. to have a chance of infecting others, the pathogen just has to survive a few seconds in tiny droplets in the air
[23:56:53] <ggreer> yet somehow many pathogens can't seem to pull this off
[23:56:55] <PapuaHardyNet> Gurkenglas: can I take you up on the offer
[23:57:36] <PapuaHardyNet> also I hope you submitted that funding app
[23:57:48] <spxtr> ggreer: I think many pathogens are airborn, various influenzas, cold viruses, many others
[23:58:01] <gwern> ggreer: I'm sure it's the usual explanation for anything: it's one of many viable builds in the current meta, with both strengths and weaknesses
[23:58:14] <kuudes> I think air is a hard domain
[23:58:24] <adiabatic> ironic
[23:58:49] <Gurkenglas> PapuaHardyNet, uhhhhhh calendly.com/gurkenglas/consultation
[23:58:58] <ggreer> people with polio get a sore throat but they don't seem to transmit it by breathing
[23:59:25] <kuudes> iirc the difference between "droplets" and "airborne" seemed to be that in droplets the particle needs to sustain lower pressure on self as it can support on the droplet surface or something
[23:59:38] <spxtr> https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK531468/ pretty long list
[23:59:43] <kuudes> iirc polio might have been airborne but only for short distances
