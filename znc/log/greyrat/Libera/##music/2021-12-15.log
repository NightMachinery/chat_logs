[00:04:28] <murthy> lol
[00:04:38] <artao> did you happen to just join the channel perhaps, coincidentally after which i said that?
[00:04:52] <artao> i have joins and quits turned off
[00:05:03] <murthy> I opened the IRC client and saw that message
[00:05:15] <murthy> thats good
[00:05:16] <artao> i keep RRREREEEEEALLLLYY want nicotine
[00:05:27] <murthy> thats what AkeTrak told me
[00:05:30] <artao> yeah, righto. timing coincidence eh
[00:05:31] <artao> lol
[00:05:52] <artao> i have a rough time with xmas this year honestly
[00:05:59] <artao> we're doing things TOTALLY different
[00:06:11] <artao> not doing it at dad's cuz he doesn't want the big gathering there
[00:06:19] <artao> so at some random rented house
[00:06:38] <artao> and no gift exchange. which is fine. except not with the kids either
[00:06:46] <artao> i love giving them gifts
[00:06:51] <murthy> afaik you are not married and you don't have kinds, what could go wrong with christmas and how could it get any worse?
[00:06:58] <artao> just get something to put into the Santa Bag if you want
[00:07:28] <artao> i'm irritated by that, to be honest .... haven't told anyone that. just been going along with it
[00:07:32] <artao> kinda don't want to go
[00:07:44] <louipc> thats the point. the parents and uncles and aunts will nag u about not having kids or being married
[00:07:49] <artao> oh .... family gathering murthy
[00:08:02] <murthy> artao: You don't like festivities at unknown outdoors?
[00:08:08] <murthy> artao: ah ok
[00:08:25] <artao> i'm the eldest of 7 and 4 of those have kids. totalling ... 13? kids ranging from 6 months to 20 yrs
[00:08:41] <murthy> artao: Usually I like family gatherings till they started bugging me about my marriage
[00:08:59] <murthy> family gatherings are now like speed dating
[00:09:05] <artao> so family gatherings are always stressful for me. but i love them and enjoy seeing them all .... for a few days
[00:09:13] <louipc> awkward
[00:09:23] <artao> but at a totally strange random place? not doing gift exchange?
[00:09:26] <artao> <sigh>
[00:09:37] <murthy> artao: oh wow, your father is awesome!
[00:09:47] <artao> he is indeed
[00:10:02] <artao> how so, to you?
[00:10:15] <murthy> my mother's brother in law is 11th of 11 children
[00:10:19] <artao> ah
[00:10:33] <artao> so you mean he's awesome as in how many kids he pumped out? LOL
[00:10:39] <murthy> such strength to bring up those many kids
[00:10:44] <louipc> artao: so does that mean u neeed at least 3 kids
[00:10:45] <artao> my youngest brother now has ... um .... 6?
[00:10:48] <artao> wait ...5 
[00:10:58] <murthy> artao: yes indeed

[00:11:16] <artao> yeah. six
[00:11:21] <artao> and his wife would gladly have more
[00:11:30] <artao> she's a kid factory
[00:11:41] <murthy> artao: Now I understand your position
[00:11:57] <artao> i was born 7 months premature. weighed 10 lbs
[00:11:59] <murthy> such responsibility of watching your siblings
[00:12:10] <murthy> artao: oh ok
[00:12:11] <artao> lol indeed
[00:12:11] <louipc> artao: wattt
[00:12:26] <artao> back then no one bitched about leaving your kids alone to babysit each other
[00:12:36] <murthy> ya
[00:12:45] <artao> 10 yr old babysitting 3 kids? fine. they'll just be gone a couple hrs
[00:12:52] <artao> send me to the store for cigs?
[00:13:03] <artao> fine. small town. they knew who i was
[00:13:06] <artao> lol
[00:13:09] <murthy> :)
[00:13:19] <artao> play outside without supervision? fine
[00:13:20] <murthy> artao: Don't say, these are common practice in India
[00:13:30] <louipc> isnt a full sized newborn about 10 lbs?
[00:13:38] <artao> yep
[00:13:59] <artao> it's a joke my mom used to tell. i was 7 months premature
[00:13:59] <murthy> classic for this evening
[00:14:03] <murthy> I want to relax
[00:14:09] <artao> as in, they got married two months before i was born

[00:15:02] <artao> murthy these days in the u.s. you're likely to get Child Protective Services called on you for letting your kids do any of that
[00:15:13] <murthy> ya
[00:15:30] <louipc> its a sick world
[00:15:38] <artao> i also support spanking. i was spanked. my parents were spanked
[00:15:40] <murthy> sick sick wold
[00:15:42] <murthy> world
[00:15:51] <artao> anyhow
[00:15:59] <artao> i don't have kids. THANK THE MONKEY KING!
[00:16:10] <murthy> artao: got beaten shit out of me
[00:16:15] <artao> :(
[00:16:18] <artao> see, that's different
[00:16:32] <artao> there's spanking, then there's abuse
[00:16:37] <murthy> for failing in school
[00:16:43] <artao> no whipping with sticks or paddles or whatever
[00:16:53] <artao> don't do it in anger
[00:16:53] <murthy> just one subject
[00:17:01] <artao> open hand on ass
[00:17:02] <louipc> wild kids need to be restrained sometimes, i dunno about spanking
[00:17:06] <artao> that's it
[00:17:10] <artao> ffs
[00:17:15] <murthy> I got with tv cable wire
[00:17:25] <murthy> got red lines on the body

[00:17:59] <murthy> and then when she was back hell rained on my father
[00:18:10] <louipc> one smack enough?
[00:18:27] <louipc> one smack per day
[00:18:37] <artao> depends on the severity. i'd say more than 10 is too much tho
[00:19:02] <murthy> artao: Kids these days are busy fighting for betterment of the world. They are better than us
[00:19:09] <artao> like, post a chart of crime severity to number of spanks so the kids know what the score is
[00:19:10] <artao> hehe heh
[00:19:13] <louipc> and a certain age it just becomes disrespect, an insult
[00:19:41] <louipc> when kids dont know how to use their words i guess that  kinda makes sense

[11:01:41] <artao> "violence never solved anything" is demonstrably  false
[11:01:46] <artao> WW2 for instance
[11:02:03] <artao> civil war
[11:02:07] <artao> standing up to bullies
[11:02:08] <louipc> i'm not arguing against self defense
[11:02:20] <artao> it's an idiotic feel-good aphorism
[11:02:29] <louipc> its essential to the equation
[11:02:39] <artao> louipc i'm just ranting here. don't expect "logic" from me RN
[11:02:42] <louipc> no self defense means the shit will also perpetuate
[11:03:00] <artao> idealism can deal with that, but the real world is NOT ideal
[11:03:13] <artao> 2nd law of thermodynamics
[11:03:22] <sublim20> look, its totally predictable that if you're just left 'alone'  you will attack me
[11:03:32] <sublim20> so i have to attack you first, its just self defense
[11:03:47] <louipc> non initiation is what im talking about. but yea theres a lot of tricky situations
[11:04:05] <artao> if you're not willing to kill the people who will gladly kill you ... the world will be left with the latter
[11:04:11] <louipc> sublim20: hmm so if you will attack me then i must attack you in self defense
[11:04:24] <artao> idealism is nice and all, but idealists die

[11:06:59] <artao> small crowd
[11:07:31] <artao> they and their supporters are willing and ready to kill the rest of us to complete their coup
[11:07:35] <louipc> artao: those wanting to kill are asking for death in a world where everyone is afforded effective self defense
[11:07:57] <louipc> problem is we dont have that second aspect
[11:08:16] <louipc> fuk u keep pulling me back in
[11:08:17] <artao> sure we do

[11:08:47] <louipc> thx for the music sublim20 
[11:08:55] <artao> srry hey
[11:09:01] <artao> i'm just "in a space"
[11:09:10] <sublim20> if the nukes ever get launched, thats the song thats getting played
[11:09:28] <artao> and, as i've said before, IRC is pretty much my only "real" social contact,m as pathetic as that is
[11:09:42] <artao> and it IS related to music, cuz writing music about it
[11:10:11] <artao> the only ones who will launch nukes is maybe pakistan, india, or n. korea
[11:10:13] <louipc> oh u brainstorming lyrical ideas
[11:10:22] <artao> the rest of us realize the consequenses
[11:10:41] <artao> THOSE asshats see nukes as a legit option tho
[11:10:57] <louipc> consider this. a citizen owning a gun is a death sentence in some places
[11:11:19] <artao> i'm not "brainstorming" but i AM pretty much just typing what i'm thinking as i think it
[11:11:30] <sublim20> look, the safest way to eliminate gun violence, is for everyone to have a gun, then no one would use one.  thats just science.

[11:13:20] <louipc> other people will fill their shoes

[11:13:25] <Bakunin> artao go to the library 
[11:13:42] <sublim20> everyone would have a gun, therefore no one would use one.  its game theory.
[11:14:04] <artao> just imagine if 100k of the worst people on the planet were to all be assassinted simultaneously all across the planet
[11:14:05] <Bakunin> lol sublim20
[11:14:07] <louipc> people would use them alright
[11:14:11] <artao> that WOULD change society

[11:14:34] <artao> of course, that's pretty much impossible
[11:14:51] <artao> just fantasy
[11:14:54] <artao> i know that
[11:15:31] <louipc> yea there will always be shit in the world

[11:49:55] <louipc> really u coulda started with an invitation to that place
[11:50:15] <louipc> then u get a better idea if people are interested or not
[11:50:17] <artao> can  i not just vent frustration publicly where we all know it and shit?
[11:50:20] <artao> i mean, cmon
[11:50:31] <artao> bitch WITH ME, not at me
[11:50:32] <artao> :P
[11:50:33] <louipc> where we all know it?
[11:50:49] <louipc> we have fundamentally different ideas
[11:51:02] <artao> PARTICULARLY that we as individuals pretty much cant do anything about it
[11:51:02] <louipc> i think that music should be the focus of this channel
[11:51:04] <artao> GAHHH
[11:51:13] <louipc> anything that strays from that is a violation
[11:51:28] <louipc> you are destroying the beautiful environment of ##muic
[11:51:29] <artao> china is pumping out ozone destroying chems despite knowing it's bad
[11:51:35] <artao> fuck the rest of the planet
[11:51:36] <louipc> with your dirty word pollution
[11:51:54] <artao> brazil is deforesting the amazon more and more despite ...
[11:51:58] <louipc> naturally i can accept that there will be a bit from time to time
[11:52:04] <artao> etc
[11:52:06] <louipc> but you are just spewing it nonstop
[11:52:08] <louipc> maybe
[11:52:13] <louipc> maybe you should be put on a list
[11:52:24] <artao> wanna talk about music? fine
[11:52:28] <artao> i'll switch it up
[11:52:32] <louipc> yes
[11:52:36] <artao> anyone else wanna talk about anything?
[11:52:38] <artao> anyone?
[11:52:42] <artao> okay. go ahead
[11:53:00] <artao> i'll go OT 
[11:53:11] <artao> what would you like to discuss?
[11:53:17] <louipc> if you have another chan to talk offtopic thats great. invite people there
[11:53:33] <artao> nope
[11:53:35] <louipc> then we can preserve this pristine musical ecosystem
[11:53:40] <artao> here is here
[11:54:14] <artao> the last 2 hrs could become the lyrics for an LP
[11:54:19] <macrobat> not actually jojk https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZ02oPz83uo

[11:54:33] <artao> don't judge
[11:54:43] <louipc> :D
[11:54:44] <artao> wanna switch subject? then do it
[11:54:52] <louipc> thansk macrobat 
[11:55:01] <artao> no one else here was talking about anythiong else
[11:55:05] <macrobat> u ppl better write better lp lyrics
[11:55:23] <artao> oh, it'd be edied of course macrobat LOL
[11:55:34] <louipc> wow dat first link was crazy 
[11:55:38] <louipc> crazy image
[11:55:39] <artao> prog rock concept album
[11:55:45] <artao> lot's of spoken lyrics
[11:56:08] <macrobat> when did poetry stop being cool?
[11:56:18] <artao> 1082 AD
[11:56:22] <louipc> when cyrano died
[11:56:26] <artao> i say that as a poet
[11:56:38] <artao> Proclamatus
[11:56:46] <louipc> sounds old
[11:57:13] <louipc> artao: so u really gonna do poem or lyrics?
[11:57:22] <macrobat> when you could be a rockstar poet without being an actual rockstar
[11:57:27] <artao> i do do both
[11:57:38] <louipc> imean with this chat
[11:57:44] <artao> tho i generally don't use lyrics in my music
[11:57:49] <louipc> or are u bulshittin
[11:57:54] <artao> oh
[11:58:02] <artao> so if i were to
[11:58:10] <artao> phrase my statements
[11:58:16] <artao> as poems or lyrics
[11:58:24] <louipc> i think u should go verbatim
[11:58:28] <artao> such like others do
[11:58:34] <louipc> stream of conciousnes man
[11:58:35] <artao> shall i abate?
[11:58:43] <artao> shall i be strict?
[11:59:14] <artao> or maybe it already is
[11:59:18] <macrobat> que sera, sera
[11:59:23] <louipc> it doesnt need to rhyme
[11:59:40] <louipc> and you can change the pace or whatever to fit into a flow
[11:59:42] <artao> i already largely type stream of consciousness and that apparently irritates people LOL
[12:00:08] <louipc> yea ##music isnt your personal diary
[12:00:10] <macrobat> so alvarius b is a reference to hypnotoad?
[12:00:20] <artao> what i jsut typed tho was a short poem re: so if i were ... to .. or maybe it 
[12:00:58] <louipc> no clue
[12:01:25] <artao> so if i wree to // phrase my statements // as poems or lyrics // such as others do // shall i abate? // sharll i be strict? // or maybe it already is
[12:01:33] <artao> ^ complete poem
[12:02:16] <artao> louipc again .... if anyone wants to actually talk about music, i'm there
[12:02:33] <artao> prior to my ranting this channel was dead and silent
[12:02:49] <artao> so it's a choice to engage or not
[12:03:24] <artao> hypnotoad macrobat? NOPE
[12:03:25] <louipc> youre missing the point

[12:04:51] <louipc> i mean... its in the /topic
[12:04:51] <macrobat> Bufo alvarius, for the DMT
[12:05:05] <artao> also, again, my ranting IS "on topic" cuz such thoughts often lead to musical inspiration
[12:05:09] <louipc> try to stay in the vicinity of the topic
[12:05:19] <louipc> sorry thats a lame excuse
[12:05:28] <artao> nope
[12:05:33] <artao> that's music hostory
[12:05:35] <louipc> everything is connected then and no topic is offtopic

[12:06:44] <louipc> artao: yea thats a cop-out
[12:06:47] <artao> what is music? WHY is music?
[12:07:18] <louipc> music is sound
[12:07:26] <artao> mk
[12:07:30] <artao> WHY is music?
[12:07:41] <louipc> and there is no why. it just is
[12:07:42] <artao> sound itself isn't music
[12:07:53] <artao> it's organized sound (or not) that's music
[12:07:54] <louipc> i used to believe that
[12:07:58] <artao> and why is it such?
[12:08:04] <louipc> organized. or not
[12:08:13] <artao> the why is to express ourselves
[12:08:30] <louipc> you can use it to express yourself
[12:08:39] <artao> and expressing ourselves includes the trials and tribulations of modern life
[12:08:42] <louipc> but i wouldnt limit it to that purpose
[12:09:26] <louipc> if you turn on your radio telescope and hear the stars and the pulsars
[12:09:32] <louipc> there is no why to that music
[12:09:42] <louipc> it just exists
[12:09:45] <artao> i would argue that almost all music is personal expression
[12:09:49] <louipc> and it doesnt care if you live or die
[12:10:01] <artao> there's rote sheet music playing ... everything else tho? 
[12:10:11] <louipc> and it doesnt care if your world burns
[12:10:25] <louipc> because it already burned out a billion years ago
[12:10:31] <louipc> and yet it still sings to you
[12:10:35] <louipc> from beyond the grave
[12:10:53] <louipc> the end
[12:10:56] <louipc> there use that in a song
[12:11:23] <artao> nice lyrics :)
[12:15:34] <artao> at least the biggest idiots are willingly killing themselves off
[12:15:54] <artao> let's hear it for pandemics and idiots WOOT \o/
[12:16:50] <artao> won't vax or mask? no sympathy if you get sick and die
