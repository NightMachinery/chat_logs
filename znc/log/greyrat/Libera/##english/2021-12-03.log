[00:30:04] <blkshp> You may be thinking of mutton (which is older sheep)

[17:58:31] <kurahaupo_> sKep: The orbit can be adjusted. However when they say "dodging",  they mean it changes direction by 60km/h, but you're not likely to notice, since it's doing about 27000 km/h
[17:59:20] <sKep> kurahaupo_: out of my head 
[17:59:31] <Me-me> furrykef: I have heard "do a poo". It is, however, formally inaccurate grammatically.
[18:00:05] <kurahaupo_> furrykef: "do" would be common in my dialect too
[18:00:14] <furrykef> Weird.
[18:00:26] <furrykef> szdani10_: OK, I take it back. "Do a poo" is fine, apparently.
[18:00:34] <kurahaupo_> Me-me: it's informal, but not "incorrect"
[18:01:01] <furrykef> I think formality has already gone out the window when using words like "poo".
[18:01:38] <Me-me> Well, that's the thing. Poo is a noun and a verb. As a noun it can be singular, but is then not something one "does" - because that's for verbs. If it's a verb, then it's not singular - because "pooing" is the correct form. Am I wrong in thinking that?
[18:02:04] <kurahaupo_> "do" and "make" are used in a variety of idioms without any apparent sense; make love, make war, do your homework, make dinner, do chores, 
[18:02:23] <Me-me> Hrm. Perhaps the noun usage is accurate, then.
[18:02:29] *** Parts: sKep (~raah@user/skep) ()
[18:02:37] <Me-me> Fair enough.
[18:03:03] <darsie> I think swerve typically includes a rotation in addition to a change in direction. The ISS would rather accelerate to make its orbit a bit higher, as it needs to increase its orbit occasionally, anyways, unless that might increase the collision risk.
[18:03:04] <kurahaupo_> you can "do" an ordinary noun meaning "create" or "perform" it

[18:03:59] <darsie> Like, you swerve a car by going relatively fast and quickly turn the steering wheel.
[18:04:44] <darsie> Normal, controlled overtaking is not swerving.
[18:04:49] <kurahaupo_> on the road, to swerve would normal trace an "S" path

[18:07:59] <kurahaupo_> One of my more exciting experiences driving a bus was having to execute a swerve around a car that turned out of a side street, into the middle of the road about 20m in front of me at 50 km/h. 60 m of spare lane to one side, then a parked car. Swish, round and back

[18:13:37] <GuiToris> [15:41] <kurahaupo_> oh the verbs starting with a-?  hmmm, so they are verbs
[18:13:43] <GuiToris> I thought they were adjectives
[18:13:47] <TimMc> GuiToris: https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/a-#English might have something useful.
[18:14:02] <kurahaupo_> strictly, they're present participles
[18:14:40] <TimMc> GuiToris: Etymology 2 #5 has the Twelve Days of Christmas. :-P
[18:14:54] <TimMc> (archaic, dialectal) In the act or process of. Used in some dialects before a present participle.
[18:15:08] <darsie> How do you pronounce "Send questions to #AskNASA."
[18:15:10] <kurahaupo_> note it's "Four calling birds" not "Four acalling birds". It's all about the rhythm
[18:15:33] <furrykef> There was a controversy back in 2012 when a Wheel of Fortune contestant solved the puzzle saying "seven swans a-swimmin'" instead of "...a-swimming", and it was considered incorrect.
[18:15:48] <kurahaupo_> darsie: I would say send Questions to hash ask NASA
[18:15:53] <TimMc> furrykef: terrible

[18:16:39] <kurahaupo_> darsie: "#asknasa" is a hash and a tag, but many people assume that "hashtag" is just the "#"
[18:16:42] *** Quits: tech_exorcist (txrcst@user/tech-exorcist/x-0447479) (Quit: see you later)
[18:17:15] <kurahaupo_> I would say that "asknasa" is a hashless tag
[18:17:31] <kurahaupo_> tag = label
[18:17:36] <furrykef> Usually # is pronounced 'hash' (or 'pound sign' in my dialect), but it's customarily pronounced 'hashtag' when it begins a, well, hash tag
[18:18:01] <TimMc> ^
[18:18:19] <TimMc> # is hash, but #asknasa is "hashtag ask nasa"
[18:18:24] <kurahaupo_> also "sharp" or "octothorpe"
[18:18:34] <furrykef> Dammit, I was just about to say octothorpe.
[18:18:46] <pussipupu> I've mostly encountered it pronounced as hash even when it introduces a hashtag to be honest
[18:18:47] <kurahaupo_> TimMc: yeah, no accounting for the stupidity of the general populace
[18:19:03] <furrykef> But I think 'octothorpe' is mostly tongue-in-cheek tech jargon, used by programmers and such
[18:19:14] <huf> not used all that much
[18:19:23] <huf> except during meta-discussions about what to call #
[18:19:37] <furrykef> I think it's usually only pronounced 'sharp' when discussing music and the programming language C#
[18:20:03] <darsie> I guess one could say: "Send questions to the hashtag askNASA."
[18:20:14] <kurahaupo_> strictly speaking sharp is ♯ rather than #
[18:20:24] <furrykef> Though the sharp symbol is properly ♯, except for some reason the C# programming language never uses it.

[18:21:37] <darsie> Not that I'm proficient in IPA :).
[18:22:02] <darsie> writing in IPA would be cool.
[18:22:02] <kurahaupo_> roughly /nasɑ/
[18:22:21] <darsie> no more spelling mistakes.
[18:22:55] <kurahaupo_> One of nice things about using a soft keyboard is you can swap it to type in other languages
[18:23:27] <kurahaupo_> One of the bad things is that every typo turns into a real weird

[18:24:39] <TimMc> kurahaupo_: It's not stupidity. It makes sense to use a construct with a lot of redundancy, since it's an abrupt grammatical boundary.
[18:25:27] <TimMc> darsie: Every dialect would be written differently. :-)
[18:25:28] <huf> yeah what kurahaupo_ sounds more like how we'd say it
[18:25:41] <TimMc> nas-uh
[18:25:41] <huf> except /nazɑ/ of course

[18:28:09] <furrykef> Who's "we", exactly?
[18:28:11] <huf> .hu
[18:28:16] <huf> possibly because násza is already a word

[18:33:11] <GuiToris> yes, that was one of the other things I found
[18:33:24] <GuiToris> you can't touch type on virtual keyboards, can you?
[18:33:28] <terminalpusher> What is the word for the more specific words used to name animals? For example Treron formosae formosae

[19:43:51] <Shariff> How do you know when you need to seperate words with a space or stack them together? I thought the word was fire cracker, but that appers to be firecracker, whereas many compound words?? are separated
[19:45:19] <LuisP18> starts out separate, hyphen then added, and then spliced together
[19:45:41] <Shariff> Is there a rule that defines when you should do what?
[19:47:32] <LuisP18> pretty much arbitrary
[19:47:47] <Shariff> Ah ok, thanks!
[19:53:08] <LuisP18> sometimes, the hyphen stage gets skipped, sometimes, the splicing stage is never rought(reached), .. so it seems to me :3

[19:56:11] <LuisP18> yea, pretty much why i'm here :P
[19:56:21] <Shariff> Makes sense :)
[19:56:51] <Shariff> In dutch it is similar.. and we have 2 versions of how to spell.. because not everyone agreed with the state version.. both seem accepted
[19:57:26] <Shariff> For instance: the word for sea is zee. Seas is then accepted as zeeën or zee-en
[19:57:57] <Shariff> The latter is the official one.. personaly I dislike that version
[19:58:09] <LuisP18> cool :p
[19:58:34] <LuisP18> i like the other as well
[19:58:37] <Shariff> To me hyphens make sense when you add 2 words together... but not when you pluralize a word.. like sea-s
[20:02:03] <Shariff> Is it correcto hyphen this:  you are able to use small- and medium-sized vehicles? or should you leave the hyphen with small out of it in english? In dutch you do add the hyphen
[20:03:13] <LuisP18> it's ok to do so
[20:03:17] <Shariff> Thanks!@
