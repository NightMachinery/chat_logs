[00:00:38] <Roey> Berlin36: ok :)
[00:00:38] <MootPoot> emmeka: yeah, as I said above, 50 something for the caps, grab yourself a cheap cheeryMX board from scamazon for another 30-40
[00:00:46] <Roey> savarina + coffee
[00:00:48] <Roey> mmmm
[00:01:30] <Berlin36> and they are stuffed with sour cherries and then a lot of sweet glaze and chocolate
[00:01:44] <Roey> :)
[00:01:50] <MootPoot> 100 bucks for a mech board with custom printed caps is actually  pretty good - usually people once they start with the caps they end up with 200-250 dollar boards
[00:03:01] <Berlin36> i use a fucken microsoft keyboard from like 2016 
[00:05:14] <Berlin36> Roey: i saw you wrote about romanian citizenship
[00:05:34] <Berlin36> getting that is only possible if you have roots there
[00:05:58] <Berlin36> like grandpa, or even further, i think it kinda works like that
[00:06:26] <emmeka> MootPoot wouldn't it make more sense at that point to buy something from a custom keyboard builder
[00:06:32] <Urchin[emacs]> I use a Logitech K120, only really sensible keyboard, IMO
[00:07:43] <MootPoot> emmeka: sure, if you have like 300 dollars burning a hole in your pocket

[00:17:43] <amigojapan> Well it's up to you if you want to ask
[00:18:56] <Berlin36> we'll have to write about 3 essays in 45 minutes lol
[00:20:13] <Berlin36> grammar and spelling mistakes are not held against us for that essays, so the only thing that matters is the message, the idea

[00:29:34] <MootPoot> or no
[00:29:45] <EdgyMC_69> update?
[00:30:03] <amigojapan> Berlin36: I am afraid tomako never wants to leave this town and go home. We already extended our stay to one week
[00:30:26] <Berlin36> hehe, it must be beautiful there
[00:30:52] <amigojapan> Berlin36: it's a beach Island, yes
[00:31:06] <emmeka> MootPoot that same site you linked has the keyboards shipped with the keycaps you design for $100 USD, which is about what I'd expect
[00:31:34] <emmeka> and I mean the keycaps alone would be $30 USD
[00:31:37] <Berlin36> oh nice amigojapan 
[00:32:14] <emmeka> guess I have to deal with vector graphics just because the world hasn't learned the glory of the International altgr keyboard layout :(
[00:32:33] <MootPoot> so about the same - well, if its all from one place then why not
[00:32:56] <MootPoot> oh, 30usd is bullshit, once you actually option out the keycaps with the full set  + prints etc, you're looking at 50
[00:33:04] <MootPoot> or that's what I got to when I configured it
[00:34:00] <emmeka> it's a purchase I can forgo for now because it requires work first
[00:34:11] <emmeka> the one place I looked at lets you also sell your design to them, which is cool
[00:34:36] <emmeka> like sure, have it, maybe somebody will have the same problem I do and I'll make $0.50 of it years from now

[05:42:56] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: is it in a train station?
[05:43:17] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: how did it taste?
[05:43:18] <amigojapan> No TsundereNoises just a ramen shop
[05:43:22] <omero> and you had ramen... 
[05:43:32] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: it was quite good
[05:43:41] <omero> what did I say about having it for breakfast?
[05:43:45] <amigojapan> Yes omero 
[05:44:05] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: anyway, I like the smell of salt air too
[05:44:34] <amigojapan> omero: hmm, still does not seem like what people have for breakfast in the West
[05:44:57] <TsundereNoises> breakfast is my favorite meal, that's a reason I could never live in Japan
[05:45:05] <TsundereNoises> I love breakfast foods
[05:45:12] <omero> mmm... amigojapan ... maybe because west and east should communicate better ;)
[05:45:44] <amigojapan> Maybe omero :)
[05:45:44] <TsundereNoises> and I don't mean パンケーキ
[05:46:17] <omero> besides, I understand you sometimes favor that heresy... you know... the pizza with jalapenos... 
[05:46:23] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: I miss bacon so much
[05:46:36] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: I love bacon, but I think my favorite breakfast is eggs benedict
[05:46:40] <omero> they dont have proper bacon in japan?
[05:46:55] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: which is tough, because that's something that 75% of restaurants fuck up terribly, it's great if done right though
[05:47:58] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: this has been our breakfast for free every day at this hotel  https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/YdmAhYkK/irccloudcapture5157697458465628234.jpg

[05:48:30] <omero> amigojapan: have you lost your mind?
[05:48:32] <TsundereNoises> try to keep it down to no more than 2 hotdogs
[05:49:06] <amigojapan> I think I have omero 
[05:49:27] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: does that meal make you miss Florida?
[05:49:30] <omero> one such things once a week is enough
[05:50:16] <omero> you ancestors are now revolving in their graves, amigojapan !
[05:50:17] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: I used to like Denny's in Florida
[05:50:34] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: disgusting
[05:50:52] <amigojapan> omero: but it's free and width 20 dollars cause they are two of us
[05:51:55] <omero> its really irrelevant, when temptation induces you into sinning, amigojapan ... and its nothing religious. its about preserving the temple that is your self
[05:52:19] <omero> just kidding of course
[05:52:41] <amigojapan> Hahaha omero

[05:57:18] <omero> my favorite breakfast: bearded clam.
[05:58:18] <TsundereNoises> clam is an aphrodisiac, you'll be horny all day
[05:58:39] <Smeef> I thought that was oysters
[05:59:00] <amigojapan> omero: they have that in Japan

[06:17:47] <omero> anniversario is the completion of an orbit on the day accomplishment
[06:18:03] <amigojapan> omero: no no. In Asia they used to celebrate everybody's birthday on the Chinese New year
[06:18:22] <Sadale> amigojapan, As of today the Chinese calendar is mostly unused here, except for a few holidays like Chinese new years, mid-fall festival, etc. Normal people knows that Chinese calender is lunisolar. We know that each Chinese month is 28-30 days, and each Chinese year is 12-13 Chinese months. That's it.

[06:45:14] <Sadale> If you ask them to pay for the pretax for the year and if you're making more than 30k, the amount of pretax to be paid would be quite a lot.

[07:26:51] <Nanobot> TsundereNoises: I don't know. The last I heard was that Calli couldn't make it, and then she could.
[07:26:53] <Sadale> Would it be in Japanese tho?

[07:28:43] <Nanobot> As far as group C goes, I'm expecting red team to be the most entertaining.
[07:28:51] <Sadale> amigojapan, oh nice
[07:28:55] * markon101 here's moose growl eats anime girl boobies
[07:29:00] <Nanobot> (and I think white team will perform better)
[07:29:04] <Sadale> amigojapan, looks lame tho lol
[07:29:12] <Sadale> amigojapan, I mean using tablet for ordering
[07:29:13] <amigojapan> Sadale: waiters just come to bring the food
[07:29:38] <Sadale> amigojapan, at least they're providing the tablet tho. Some restaurants here requires you to order using your own smartphone
[07:29:49] * markon101 brings food to amigojapan
[07:29:50] <Nanobot> TsundereNoises: Iofi is in the thumbnail for white C team
[07:29:57] <TsundereNoises> I don't feel like I have a good read on the C groups, I have watched exactly 0 content from the EN2 girls, and barely anything from Anya or Reine or IRS-chan
[07:31:03] <Nanobot> I can't watch 7 streams at once!
[07:31:11] <TsundereNoises> my computer definitely can't handle it
[07:31:21] <amigojapan> Wow Sadale 
[07:31:26] <Nanobot> My computer can handle it. My Internet connection is another matter.
[07:31:32] <amigojapan> markon101: ty
[07:31:32] <Nanobot> And my ears definitely can't handle it.
[07:31:33] <Sadale> amigojapan, they're rare tho. But they exist
[07:31:53] <amigojapan> Sadale: what if you don't have a smart phone?
[07:31:59] <Sadale> amigojapan, I think it's a bit more common in mainland China. Some restaurants use WeChat app for making order.
[07:32:01] <Sadale> amigojapan, lol too bad
[07:32:15] <Sadale> amigojapan, I dunno maybe you could ask the waiter for making the order for you?
[07:32:18] <TsundereNoises> Nanobot: we should paint our faces and… eat unhealthy snack food?
[07:32:25] <Nanobot> I think I'm going to mostly watch red team C's perspective. And, of course, I'll go back and watch more perspectives after it's over.
[07:32:34] <amigojapan> Ah ok Sadale 
[07:32:55] <Nanobot> TsundereNoises: I don't have any paint. I could cut myself.
[07:33:07] <TsundereNoises> Nanobot: only do that if your team loses!
[07:33:12] * markon101 l3arns to use /me uses it a lot
[07:33:15] <Nanobot> For white, you'll have to find some other liquid.
[07:33:17] <TsundereNoises> I don't know if I'm strong enough to riot single-handed
[07:33:46] <TsundereNoises> that wasn't meant to be a masturbation joke, but it has nice synergy
[07:33:59] <amigojapan> Sadale: weechat must be very bloated
[07:33:59] <markon101> Bahahaha
[07:34:05] <Sadale> amigojapan, wechat*
[07:34:10] <markon101> WeeChat is the shit
[07:34:14] <markon101> I love it
[07:34:16] <TsundereNoises> Miko Stream has started
[07:34:21] <amigojapan> Oh right Sadale 
[07:34:24] <Sadale> amigojapan, yep. It has a lot of "applets" inside. IIRC those applets are just HTML5 apps.
[07:34:48] <TsundereNoises> I think I'm going to just watch Miko for now, and go watch White B afterwards
[07:34:53] <markon101> Ahhh so it's slow
[07:35:03] <amigojapan> Ah ok Sadale 
[07:35:14] <markon101> I've just been obsessed with Re:Zero lately. 
[07:35:22] <Sadale> amigojapan, Anyway those apps aren't accessible using normal web browser. You have to install WeChat to use them
[07:35:28] <Sadale> amigojapan, so it's a walled garden :/
[07:35:40] <Sadale> amigojapan, Anyway almost everyone in mainland China has WeChat.

[07:36:06] <markon101> Not WeChat
[07:36:08] <Sadale> amigojapan, it's free to use
[07:36:14] <Nanobot> red team C has two more members than white team C. Rigged.
[07:36:17] <Sadale> markon101, we're talking about WeChat. The Chinese app.

[07:36:51] <Sadale> Whatsapp and Facebook and Google are corporate spyware as well :P
[07:36:57] <markon101> Yes agreed
[07:36:58] <TsundereNoises> Sadale: White Team B is all my favorite girls basically
[07:37:05] <Sadale> If you're worried tho get a dedicated phone for risky apps.
[07:37:51] <Nanobot> TsundereNoises: Looking over the members, it sure looks to me like white team has the advantage.
[07:37:52] <TsundereNoises> I say this, but Red B is also all great
[07:38:09] <TsundereNoises> Nanobot: yeah I hate to cheer for the… overdog? but I wil
[07:38:51] <markon101> We all have our "guilty pleasures" when it comes to privacy respecting applications. My phone is not privacy respecting at all. I know I could change this but I don't. Mainly because I use a lot of proprietary software for my business. Especially mileage tracking. 
[07:39:22] <Sadale> ouch :(

[07:54:26] <Nanobot> Calli's probably the most seiso member of Myth.

[07:55:01] <TsundereNoises> not Ina?
[07:55:16] <gotobreak> I hope I'm not annoying. I'm a little stoned so I get loose as a goose. 
[07:55:20] <Nanobot> No, Ina isn't seiso. She's just soft-spoken.
[07:55:23] <TsundereNoises> I have only watched Calli for some of those Hunter ttrpg games, nothing else
[07:55:34] <Nanobot> Ina makes lewd jokes quite a lot and hasn't hidden that she likes ecchi things.

[08:40:08] <OERIAS> snake, it isn't but I am making this a point because this isn't the first time when a person has stated a veiled racist remark regarding food
[08:40:17] <OERIAS> snake, yes they were.
[08:40:23] <TsundereNoises> someone else had it worse doesn't mean discrimination should just be ignored, snake
[08:40:40] <Nanobot> So much for the white team being overpowered.
[08:40:44] <TsundereNoises> but I won't get into this, I'm watching vtubers throw a sports festival
[08:40:49] <amigojapan> OERIAS: I showed him a picture of my ramen and he said it looks like semen
[08:40:51] <TsundereNoises> yeah really
[08:40:53] <OERIAS> but in America, being Asian American means that you are a perpetual foreigner
[08:41:31] <snake> There is area between ignoring an issue and focusing too much on an issue
[08:42:16] <TsundereNoises> Nanobot: Suisei just woke up though
[08:42:30] <TsundereNoises> also, half-asleep suisei voice is the best
[08:42:34] <TsundereNoises> other than maybe her normal voice
[08:42:36] <snake> It’s not on the same level so it doesnt warrant the same amount of dilligence
[08:43:06] <TsundereNoises> snake: you're kind of doing the worst thing here, where people support racism while not realizing it
[08:43:20] <snake> OeriAS: they want you to quit
[08:43:23] <snake> Dont do it
[08:43:40] <jessedesu3> I'm an artist
[08:43:42] <snake> Thats how they screw you out of unemployment benefits
[08:43:50] <TsundereNoises> Nanobot: now, if White turns it around I can give all the credit to Suisei
[08:43:51] <amigojapan> OERIAS: my breakfast was also called "disgusting", this  https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/u5FMnFFk/irccloudcapture8894161471476167903.jpg

[09:14:11] <TsundereNoises> you have a couple pounds margin of error, an effective diet can have you losing less than that per week but still be great over the long run
[09:14:40] <TsundereNoises> freaking out about 1 lb differences is always dumb
[09:14:56] <TsundereNoises> until it's a pattern
[09:15:01] <MootPoot> but the thing is literally nothing happened - I'm at the exact same weight
[09:15:08] <MootPoot> within 100g
[09:15:34] <TsundereNoises> it's been a week
[09:15:58] <MootPoot> the only thing I've noticed is that its harder for me to eat a lot
[09:16:56] <TsundereNoises> it might not be working, I just think a week is too soon to decide anything about any diet ever
[09:17:11] <TsundereNoises> because your weight varies more than you think
[09:17:19] <TsundereNoises> even if it doesn't vary, if you get what I mean
[09:20:01] <TsundereNoises> should we be worried about firing squads?
[09:23:36] <ButterNoodle> get fired
[09:23:37] <MootPoot> damn
[09:23:39] <MootPoot> keto is expensive
[09:23:56] <ButterNoodle> so bored
[09:24:06] <MootPoot> if I buy whole chicken - 3.50 dollars per pound

[09:24:46] <MootPoot> hmmmmmmmmmmmm
[09:25:00] <MootPoot> math says its about 8-9 dollars a day of food
[09:25:09] <amigojapan> MootPoot: keto is indeed expensive
[09:25:26] <jessedesu3> Meth says don't do drugs
[09:25:35] <MootPoot> price is unknown so lets push it to 10 bucks a day
[09:25:47] <MootPoot> 320 dollarydoos a month
[09:25:58] <MootPoot> probably more like 400 with other crap
[09:26:06] <MootPoot> doable...I spend more then that on dumb shit
[09:27:43] <amigojapan> MootPoot: quite dumb poop and start reading healthy
[09:27:55] <MootPoot> ????????
[09:27:56] <amigojapan> Eating*
[09:28:02] <MootPoot> dumb poop?
[09:28:17] <MootPoot> you're starting to sound like mixfix lol
[09:28:17] <amigojapan> MootPoot: you just said it
[09:28:20] <TsundereNoises> !addquote amigojapan quite dumb poop and start reading healthy
[09:28:20] <ImoutoBot> TsundereNoises: Quote added for amigojapan (286)
[09:28:32] <MootPoot> AMIGO
[09:28:41] <amigojapan> MootPoot: you said you use more money on TV dump pooo
[09:28:46] <MootPoot> you can't casually equate poot poop with shit
[09:29:03] <MootPoot> shit can mean poo but it can also mean stuff
[09:29:08] <amigojapan> MootPoot: I don't sware
[09:29:15] <MootPoot> TsundereNoises: help
[09:29:26] <TsundereNoises> crap works better than poop if you're trying to substitute a word and avoid swears amigojapan
[09:29:32] <TsundereNoises> MootPoot: I thought adding the quote WAS helping
[09:29:42] <TsundereNoises> I'm not very helpful right now
[09:29:44] <amigojapan> Ah ok TsundereNoises 
[09:30:08] <MootPoot> well, I guess I can start eating healthy AND pay back my student loans
[09:30:22] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: poop is more closely linked to actual excrement, whereas shit often tends to mean "stuff", crap can also have that double meaning
[09:30:29] <TsundereNoises> read healthing MootPoot
[09:30:46] <amigojapan> Gotcha TsundereNoises 
[09:31:17] <TsundereNoises> Nanobot: I can't decide if that counts as closing the gap or not
[09:31:34] <Nanobot> Percentage-wise, I guess?
[09:31:40] <TsundereNoises> that's what I'm telling myself!
[09:31:47] <Nanobot> That competition was worth so much more than the ones before.
[09:32:02] <MootPoot> that's it 
[09:32:04] <MootPoot> I'm going hunting
[09:32:06] <TsundereNoises> I'm wondering if they didn't update some earlier point totals?
[09:32:13] <MootPoot> that will fix my meat
[09:32:20] <TsundereNoises> but yeah
[09:32:22] <TsundereNoises> it was worth a lot
[09:32:51] <Nanobot> How many people flew on each team? Wasn't it like 4 each?
[09:33:04] <TsundereNoises> I wasn't counting, but yeah it couldn't have been everyone
[09:33:11] <Nanobot> 55*4 = 220. Shouldn't the total be higher than it is now?
[09:33:35] <TsundereNoises> the points seem very chaotic to me, but I'm admittedly having trouble keeping track of things
[09:33:41] <TsundereNoises> between the time and the language barrier
[09:34:22] <Nanobot> Oh wait, I think it was only 3 fliers per team. One each from A, and B, and C.
[09:35:24] <TsundereNoises> yeah, looking at the last few, you must be right
[09:35:34] <TsundereNoises> because Kiara flew, but no one else on White C
[09:36:31] <TsundereNoises> I wonder if it happened in training, but I'd really love to see Nene try that last event
[09:36:35] <Nanobot> What threw me off was I thought I saw Moona up there when Pekora was going.
[09:37:13] <TsundereNoises> Moona is Red C and Pekora is Red A though!
[09:37:42] <Nanobot> Yeah, but I swear I saw Moona up on the launch platform with Pekora just before Pekora did her first attempt.
[09:38:11] <Nanobot> So, I was thinking red sent four people, because Moona was up there twice.
[09:39:18] <Nanobot> I saw Watame and AZKi practice this one. They didn't do well.
[09:39:44] <TsundereNoises> Nene is hilariously bad at flying
[09:40:18] <TsundereNoises> messa mesa rode is vital for making travel safer
[09:40:25] <Nanobot> I want to see Miko do birdman darts, just to see if she'll zenloss.
[09:40:39] <Nanobot> She almost did while renovating it
[09:42:22] <Nanobot> It's crazy to see so many people at once.
[09:43:39] <Nanobot> White team C are like, "Huh.. what's this honey stuff? How does this work? Can't seem to jump on it very well..."
[09:49:06] <TsundereNoises> I wonder if Miko was listening to Halloween Night a lot because of halloween
[09:49:11] <MootPoot> hmmmm
[09:49:12] <TsundereNoises> since she's using it as background music
[09:49:18] <amigojapan> MootPoot: there is plenty of human game :)
[09:49:20] <MootPoot> amigojapan: I worked out a theoretical budget
[09:49:39] <amigojapan> Good good MootPoot

[09:50:58] <MootPoot> I think...500 bucks should be enough to  munch on keto
[09:51:13] <amigojapan> I hope so MootPoot 
[09:52:03] <MootPoot> the only other thing I could do is cut out my play toys budget
[09:52:23] <MootPoot> but then that would mean no more random side projects to keep myself busy on the weekends
[09:53:11] <amigojapan> MootPoot: cut it down to 300
[09:53:24] <amigojapan> MootPoot: 500 is way too much
[09:53:32] <MootPoot> ehhhh
[09:53:43] <TsundereNoises> Miko looks so threatening
[09:53:55] <TsundereNoises> I'm intimidated

[09:56:32] <ButterNoodle> now if u pissed IN two gay men...
[09:56:52] <MootPoot> amigojapan: if I reduce the 500 to 300 where does the extra 200 go
[09:57:00] <MootPoot> I guess it could go into the loan
[09:59:20] <Nanobot> I hate all the spam in Miko's chat. What even is the point of those bots? Is someone trying to make a point, because it's lost on me.
[09:59:26] <Nanobot> It's just random words.
[09:59:32] <TsundereNoises> I don't know, I turn off the chats

[10:25:31] <MootPoot> I wasen't expecting that
[10:26:00] <MootPoot> amigojapan: turns out its same price to buy chicken breast already deboned and packaged then whole chicken
[10:26:38] <MootPoot> google says about 62% of a whole chicken is meat = taking into account my noob skills, that menas that I'll probably get 50% at best
[10:27:22] <MootPoot> 1lb whole chicken is 3.50 here, and then 1lb of breast is 7.89
[10:28:02] <MootPoot> !c (3.5*2)/7.89
[10:28:03] <ImoutoBot> MootPoot: 0.8871989860583017
[10:28:21] <MootPoot> so ~11% more expensive to buy chicken breast per unit of meat
[10:29:51] <amigojapan> MootPoot: I can only eat so much chicken. It's but my favourite meat
[10:30:12] <amigojapan> MootPoot: I have been eating lots of sausage

[10:30:36] <amigojapan> It's not my favourite meat*
[10:31:37] <amigojapan> MootPoot: it works for me, altho I guess each brand must be different
[10:31:55] <MootPoot> maybe - sausages here have bread mashed up into it to reduce cost
[10:32:13] <amigojapan> I see
[10:32:23] <MootPoot> not much, but it's ther
[10:32:29] <MootPoot> but the main thing is the salt

[10:33:33] <MootPoot> the nurtition facts at the bottom - 1 sausage has 22% of your daily salt

[10:47:40] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: I like the favour of coconut oil alone
[10:47:51] <MootPoot> keel?

[10:48:11] <ButterNoodle> I dont care for them unless they are in chinese sauce
[10:48:16] <MootPoot> thicc thighs then

[10:55:56] <Sadale> MootPoot, lololololol
[10:55:58] <MootPoot> since the start
[10:56:15] <MootPoot> my balls are as empty as my bank account
[10:57:11] <amigojapan> MootPoot: we are really fortunate, it seems my son is getting the kind of scholarship you don't need to return
[10:57:39] <Sadale> amigojapan, congratz

[11:05:38] <MootPoot> nice
[11:05:48] <MootPoot> there's a type of scholarship that you dont need to return?
[11:06:16] * MootPoot just put 4 frozen fish fillets in the toaster oven with a thermometer probe rammed up inside it's rear
[11:09:28] <Sadale> huh? Is there even a type of scholarship that you have to return?
[11:10:06] <MootPoot> my thots exactly , I thought all scholarships were free
[11:10:15] <MootPoot> except for the corporate kind
[11:10:39] <MootPoot> where the company pays you but then you have to sign a contract to work for them for a few years
[11:11:13] <Sadale> Here there's low-interest rate government loan tho
[11:11:23] <Sadale> And the government also pay for the tuition fee for the poor
[11:11:28] <Sadale> (college)
[11:12:07] <MootPoot> should I get a wireless meat thermometer
[11:12:29] <MootPoot> I'm gonna be baking a LOT

[22:21:58] <zoidberg> there are ways to get around it in C though
[22:22:52] <Berlin36> yeah but it's hard af
[22:22:55] <Berlin36> i tried once in c++
[22:23:07] <Berlin36> it didn't go well...
[22:23:17] <zoidberg> really? what did you use?
[22:23:26] <zoidberg> structs?
[22:23:36] <zoidberg> I used arrays back then
[22:24:07] <Berlin36> yeaaaaj
[22:24:11] <Berlin36> structs
[22:24:17] <Berlin36> tried with an array
[22:24:22] <Berlin36> it's pretty hard anyways
[22:24:25] <Berlin36> and gets messy
[22:25:29] <zoidberg> tbh I hardly use functions with return values Berlin36 
[22:25:48] <Berlin36> void functions huh
[22:25:55] <zoidberg> yeah
[22:26:02] <Berlin36> functions with return values are sometimes really needed 
[22:26:20] <Berlin36> sooo i wanted to create a library that is related to cryptography and stuff
[22:26:35] <Berlin36> and it's more convenient to return the results as the user can just use them however he wants
[22:26:42] <Berlin36> like storing the result into a variable or some shit
[22:27:04] <zoidberg> of course of course, I am just a trash programmer who did some embedded stuff
[22:27:12] <zoidberg> I hardly need return values
[22:27:58] <zoidberg> I am not much of a programmer
[22:28:48] <Berlin36> well, me neither
[22:28:53] <Berlin36> i try to be one tho
[22:29:17] <Berlin36> holy shit you can store big fucking numbers in go

[22:29:54] <Berlin36> im doing some stuff here, from golang tour
[22:29:55] <Berlin36> and
[22:30:09] <Berlin36> it's like a float but with 100 digits after a dot
[22:30:21] <Berlin36> but in this form like 3.7382748383e+100
[22:30:43] <zoidberg> damn
[22:31:01] <Berlin36> i once coded a program that calculates biiiig factorials 
[22:31:02] <Berlin36> in c++
[22:31:16] <Berlin36> holy fuck that was messed up, idk how accurate that calculations were...
[22:31:31] <Berlin36> but i calculated digits like 10 000!
[22:31:39] <Berlin36> it took a few minutes lmao

[23:03:55] <Berlin36> zoidberg, there is no "while" in go
[23:04:04] <Berlin36> it's also for
[23:04:25] <Berlin36> but the  init and post statements are ommited
[23:04:34] <Berlin36> and yeah it works i guess
[23:05:00] <Berlin36> for true {// do shit}
[23:05:20] <Urchin[emacs]> zoidberg: well, for loop in go is also a while loop if you feed it less parameters
[23:05:27] <Berlin36> ye
[23:06:11] <Berlin36> for i := 0; i < 100; i++ {//do stuff}
[23:06:16] <Berlin36> that is a for loop

[23:06:48] <Jigsy> Which is another reason why it kinda bites.

[23:08:23] <Jigsy> Yes!
[23:08:24] <Urchin[emacs]> essentially if in lisp

[23:22:59] <zoidberg> Wow
[23:23:13] <Berlin36> world of warcraft
[23:23:32] <Berlin36> i mean i know there is lisp language
[23:23:33] <Berlin36> but
[23:23:33] <Urchin[emacs]> Berlin36: Common Lisp is an old school functional programming language for general and systems programming
[23:23:35] <Berlin36> why is it common
[23:23:46] <Urchin[emacs]> Berlin36: just the name/standard
[23:23:49] <Berlin36> oh
[23:23:52] <Berlin36> right
[23:24:15] <zoidberg> Because everyone makes their own version of lisp.
[23:24:15] <Berlin36> isn't it dead?
[23:24:30] <zoidberg> Lisp is way too kind
[23:24:43] <Berlin36> lol, Hy
[23:25:01] <Berlin36> lisp dialect 
[23:25:12] <Berlin36> and 
[23:25:13] <Berlin36> clojure
[23:25:14] <Urchin[emacs]> Berlin36: it's not hot any more, but not entirely dead
[23:25:19] <zoidberg> Common Lisp is the main and the oldest of all but there are bunch of others that come from it, use it, exploit it and what not
[23:25:40] <Urchin[emacs]> Clojure probably gets the most innovation these days, but, in many ways it's inferior to Common Lisp
[23:25:45] <Berlin36> what's so special about it 
[23:25:50] <zoidberg> Lisp is fun to play around Berlin36. It is unique and powerful.
[23:25:56] <Berlin36> oh
[23:25:57] <Urchin[emacs]> Clojure doesn't have real reader macros really
[23:26:18] <Berlin36> what is a macro system
[23:26:22] <Urchin[emacs]> Berlin36: Common Lisp is a bit of a kitchen sink language
[23:26:28] <Berlin36> it says that Clojure has a powerful macro system
[23:26:39] <Berlin36> duuude, not the kitchen sink
[23:26:57] <Urchin[emacs]> Berlin36: Clojure has half of a macro system compared to Common Lisp
[23:26:59] <zoidberg> Yeah, lisp macros are unique
[23:27:23] <Berlin36> and what are those macro systems
[23:27:24] <Urchin[emacs]> Berlin36: well, you're pretty enthusiastic for C++, which is another kitchen sink language
[23:27:25] <Berlin36> what is that for
[23:27:31] <Berlin36> oh yeah Urchin[emacs] 
[23:27:35] <Berlin36> i don't do c++ now
[23:27:36] <Urchin[emacs]> Berlin36: they modify the programming language
[23:27:40] <zoidberg> And also lisp is very flexible in programming style Berlin36
[23:27:50] <Berlin36> it's more of an old programmer guy language
[23:28:02] <Berlin36> sounds nice
[23:28:32] <zoidberg> Not really, it’s still being used, developed and researched in
[23:28:48] <zoidberg> Go talk to beach in #lisp
[23:28:52] <Berlin36> i talk about c++, but yeah it's still used a lot
[23:29:14] <zoidberg> Oh wait, I don’t know if they’re here.
[23:29:25] <Berlin36> idunno idunno, lisp sounds like a cool language to play with around, but idk why should i learn it xd
[23:29:41] <Urchin[emacs]> anywy, afk
[23:29:47] <Berlin36> okay Urchin[emacs] 
[23:30:14] <zoidberg> You should learn lisp for parenthesis
[23:30:34] <Jigsy> Learn COBOL.
[23:31:01] <Berlin36> yeeeee 
[23:31:04] <Berlin36> cobol the old boi
[23:31:46] <zoidberg> Why do you learn any programming language? To write code and make life somewhat easier.
[23:32:01] <zoidberg> I find doing it in lisp bit more fun
[23:32:10] <zoidberg> Wait, lot more fun
[23:32:52] <Berlin36> i see
[23:33:23] <zoidberg> And also the way you learn lisp is fun itself. No need to write code completely and and execute it.
[23:33:56] <Berlin36> why not
[23:33:57] <zoidberg> With slime, emacs there’s this feature where you can run each line you write and see what goes on
[23:34:05] <Berlin36> whh-
[23:34:06] <Berlin36> what
[23:34:11] <zoidberg> Yeah
[23:34:38] <Berlin36> nice nice
[23:34:39] <zoidberg> You can execute the whole program at once too
[23:35:00] <Berlin36> weird how you can run each line
[23:35:06] <Berlin36> i can't imagine how is that
[23:35:07] <zoidberg> There’s just a simple macro, C-c C-c I think
[23:35:41] <zoidberg> Lisp is different, the way you write lisp is different
[23:35:54] <zoidberg> The way interpreter does is different
[23:36:04] <Berlin36> i see
[23:36:15] <Urchin[emacs]> Berlin36: what else did you try besides C++ again?
[23:36:21] <Berlin36> im trying golang now
[23:36:27] <Berlin36> well, im learning it
[23:37:11] <Urchin[emacs]> one cool thing about Emacs is the ability to just evaluate anything of Emacs Lisp on the fly and change the behavior that way
[23:39:11] <zoidberg> If you are looking for fun, you can play with emacs later
[23:39:36] <zoidberg> Emacs lisp is so easy to play that even an idiot like me did some shit on it
[23:39:48] <Berlin36> huh
[23:39:54] <Berlin36> what exactly can you do with lisp
[23:40:18] <zoidberg> Everything you can do with any other programming language
[23:41:11] <Berlin36> oh
[23:41:55] <Berlin36> gonna try it sometime
[23:42:05] <Berlin36> but i don't think it will be any time soon
[23:42:20] <Berlin36> i just wanna concentrate on knowing golang well
[23:43:31] <zoidberg> It’s totally upto you anyways, just wanted to say it.
[23:44:07] <Urchin[emacs]> Berlin36: there are many versions of lisp, some are scripting languages for programs
