[13:28:37] <jiggawatt> fling: /msg NickServ help regain
[13:29:05] <fling> I had it automated with znc somehow in the past
[13:29:33] <bookworm> what you actually want is [[certauth]]
[13:29:33] <ZNC-Linker> https://wiki.znc.in/certauth
[13:29:34] <jiggawatt> well, on znc you want to identify properly
[13:29:48] <jiggawatt> so services doesn't hold your nick
[13:29:54] <jiggawatt> OFTC doesn't do SASL iirc
[13:30:09] <bookworm> no, they do certs
[13:30:13] <jiggawatt> s/hold/enforce
[13:30:14] <jiggawatt> right
[13:30:17] <jiggawatt> but fuck certs
[13:30:17] <fling> this is what probably happening
[13:30:27] <jiggawatt> fling: /msg NickServ help set enforce
[13:30:27] <fling> I'm using cert but identifying the wrong way
[13:30:29] <jiggawatt> turn that bullshit off
[13:30:44] <jiggawatt> your nick is probably retarded anyways so nobody will want it
[13:30:45] <bookworm> bad idea, you should use them on oftc
[13:30:57] <jiggawatt> no just use a unique password
[13:31:07] <bookworm> no
[13:31:12] <jiggawatt> yes
[13:31:18] <fling> how many watt is jiggawatt? :>
[13:31:24] <jiggawatt> 1.21 !!!!!!!!!!!!!!w
[13:31:24] <bookworm> you want to identify when you connect, oftc does that with certs
[13:31:28] <jiggawatt> w00000000000000000000000
[13:31:39] <jiggawatt> nah just turn enforce off
[13:31:40] <jiggawatt> it's b.s.
[13:31:59] <jiggawatt> Enforce means OFTC's services can just take over your nick whenever it fucking wants
[13:32:12] <jiggawatt> dial that shit down
[13:32:35] <bookworm> they can do that anyhow
[13:32:46] <fling> bookworm: it does not auth when I enable RequireAuth in sasl module
[13:32:58] <jiggawatt> OFTC doesn't use SASL
[13:32:58] <fling> but it does auth just fine when I disable RequireAuth
[13:33:04] <bookworm> fling: you don't want to use sasl at all
[13:33:09] <fling> oh
[13:33:11] <jiggawatt> yah
[13:33:13] <jiggawatt> that's the problem
[13:33:20] <jiggawatt> just NickServ password or certauth
[13:33:36] <jiggawatt> you can also just setup your bouncer's IP on the access list
[13:33:41] <fling> this is why I asked :>
[13:33:44] <jiggawatt> /msg NickServ help access
[13:33:49] <bookworm> https://www.oftc.net/NickServ/CertFP/#znc fling
[13:33:55] <fling> thanks
[13:34:02] <fling> jiggawatt: I don't want to lock myself out
[13:34:15] <jiggawatt> no, that's not how access list works
[13:34:26] <jiggawatt> if your bouncer is on the access list, then services won't enforce your nick
[13:34:32] <jiggawatt> even if you leave enforce on
[13:34:52] <bookworm> can you please not give bad advice...
[13:34:54] <jiggawatt> doesn't auth you though
[13:35:01] <jiggawatt> it's great advice bookworm 
[13:35:14] <fling> sounds too jigaa
[13:35:14] <jiggawatt> it's how you play on a non-SASL network
[13:35:26] <bookworm> definitely not no
[13:35:38] <jiggawatt> that's a double negative bookworm 
[13:35:41] <jiggawatt> thanks for agreeing with me :)
[13:35:52] <fling> thanks for various advices, guys! I have to go, will return later
