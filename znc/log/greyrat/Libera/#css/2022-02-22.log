[13:50:04] <rickame> and do i need a container element around all 3? hope not
[13:50:37] <rick123> Ok, so if the same custom web component is used 100 times, as long as the style tags have same textual content or are obtained by cloning the same node, then they will "share a single backing stylesheet"
[13:51:14] <rick123> nbjoerg: sharing a single backing stylesheet doesn't mean the same DOM nodes for the style tags right ? In that case its just some internal optimisation which we as users still won't be able to understand in terms of "how"
[13:51:25] <nbjoerg> rickame: https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/
[13:51:38] <nbjoerg> rickame: that or use a grid
[13:52:07] <nbjoerg> rick123: it's an optimisation, yes
[13:53:26] <rickame> flexbox is smart idea. i wonder tho, could the width of each block be uniform even if their content isnt?
[13:53:32] <rickame> or is that why you said maybe grid?
[13:54:01] <rickame> i wanna set a min-max width, but each of the 3 content blocks should have same width so everything lines up

[13:54:55] <rickame> k nice and ill read it but can uniform width be enforced on the flex idea?
[13:55:09] <nbjoerg> it's a bit more tricky with flex
[13:58:00] <rickame> ty
[14:00:23] <rickame> so you're thinking since there's a finite set of 'cells' (left margin, center content, right margin) that's a good candidate for grid?
[14:00:40] <rickame> because flexbox is more for unbounded lists i think
[14:00:52] <nbjoerg> and often header/footer as well
[14:01:14] <rickame> well no those 3 header main footer would be in the center content cell
[14:01:23] <rickame> i guess you were thinking about applying grid deeper
[14:01:42] <rickame> so left margin, center header main footer, right margin. 5 cells
[14:01:42] <nbjoerg> 3x3 grid
[14:01:51] <rickame> oh

[14:02:55] <rickame> ya all 3 will be centered and same narrow width
[14:03:05] <rickame> basic '1 column' layout

[20:13:38] <twiclo> I'm making a chrome extension and the popup window for those just run html. I have images that I've set to max-width:100% and height: auto; because I want them to scale to fit the size of the popup. When I applied these the images came out very small. I think it's because they're no longer fighting with the other elements in the div for space and are just giving it all up
[20:13:47] <twiclo> What's a good solution for this?

[22:15:47] <rickame> https://jsfiddle.net/5qb6xpeu/1/ how can i make header main and footer all match width pls?
[22:36:11] <matsaman> put them all in a containing element
[22:46:23] <rickame> i was afraid of that. no other solution?
[22:46:39] <rickame> would a switch to display: grid in <body> be an option?

[22:46:54] <rickame> id really like to find a solution that doesn't use a wrapper
[22:50:09] <nbjoerg> https://jsfiddle.net/b1hqfLsm/
[22:50:34] <nbjoerg> that's the way it can be done with flex
[22:52:19] <rickame> ya with a wrapper. it possible to pull off using grid without the wrapper?
[22:53:24] *** Quits: WishBoy (~WishBoy@user/wishboy) ()
[22:54:29] <matsaman> what's the point of it being narrower if there's less content
[22:54:59] <rickame> what? i just want a flexible 1 column layout
[22:56:29] <matsaman> flexible for what
[22:56:36] <rickame> the device width
[22:56:59] <matsaman> what's wrong with the wrapper?
[22:57:35] <nbjoerg> https://jsfiddle.net/b1hqfLsm/1/ and a variant with grid
[22:57:44] <rickame> i just wanna learn and ic ant figure it out myself but i *feel* grid could pull it off
[22:57:49] <rickame> but i might be wrong
[22:58:13] <rickame> ok now we're talking
[22:58:33] <rickame> i gotta think on this tyvm nbjoerg

[23:26:42] <matsaman> grid is stupid shite
[23:38:36] <rickame> why?

[23:56:22] <rickame> some are
[23:57:18] <FunkyBob> i vastly prefer grid over our old practice of slicing tables
