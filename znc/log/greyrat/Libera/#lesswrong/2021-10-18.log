[00:10:07] <catern> possibly from Finns on Krautchan /int/
[00:14:13] <rsaarelm> It's fading now when people haven't studied German as the default foreign langauge for several generations anymore.
[00:16:06] <rsaarelm> It's sorta like the graffiti sketch in Life of Brian, I don't think there were many cohorts younger than the Python guys for whom it would have been immediately funny.

[00:18:43] <feep> // If you figure out how to do this, I will be grateful. I'mma let it lie for now.
[00:18:56] <feep> it wasn't that hard, past me ... I'm worried that means I've missed some complexity.
[00:19:57] <gwern> (then your past self is to blame for not adding test cases/checks or examples of what made it so maliciously subtle)
[00:21:03] <feep> to be fair, this is a self-hosted compiler that got unittests pretty late.

[00:22:13] <rsaarelm> I guess the graffiti grammar lecture in Life of Brian just reads as random surrealism to people watching it today. I'm having some trouble thinking of another sketch that has quite that sort of uncanniness with the thing it's making fun of having dropped out of memory.

[00:52:01] <catern> is there an example? if all you have to do is inscribe elbereth^Wpress on your clothing, seems like everyone would be doing it
[00:52:26] <ggreer> have you seen videos of the riots? tons of people have "press" and medic stuff on

[00:54:59] <catern> so why aren't they just literally all wearing "press" markings?
[00:57:11] <ggreer> sometimes it can be used to uniquely identify you. if everyone wears black, it's much harder to identify who did what
[00:57:23] <ggreer> also even among rioters, not everyone is despicable
[00:57:47] <catern> everyone wearing press markings would be good for rioters though
[00:58:29] <catern> a few accidental beatings of actual press == guaranteed negative coverage of police
[00:58:55] <ggreer> the real press doesn't go to the riots. they just get footage from people who were there
[00:59:09] <ggreer> or if they do, they have private security surrounding them

[03:58:01] <RiversHaveWings> gwern: those are separate upscalers
[03:58:43] <RiversHaveWings> Not end-to-end
[03:58:47] <RiversHaveWings> AFAICT.
[03:59:42] <gwern> they don't say they train the layers offline, and refer to it as progressive generation, while citing https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2018_workshops/papers/w13/Ahn_Image_Super-Resolution_via_CVPR_2018_paper.pdf

[04:00:01] <gwern> and as presented it's fully end to end even if they chose not to
[04:00:23] <gwern> cf progan
[04:02:17] <RiversHaveWings> "SR3, by comparison, relies on a series of iterative refinement steps, each of which is trained with a regression loss."
[04:02:21] <RiversHaveWings> separate losses.
[04:02:36] <RiversHaveWings> Bc not end-to-end.
[04:03:22] <gwern> that can still be end to end; it doesn't specify where the regression loss is applied, and you can apply multiple losses to arbitrary layers, you know that (eg MSG-GAN)
[04:04:07] <gwern> (MSG-GAN incidentally illustrates how progressive growing can lead to a pretty nice architecture, not merely being an efficiency hack)
[04:06:09] <nshepperd> couldn't you like. add a new down/upsampling stage in the middle of the unet. with its output layer initialised to 0. As a sort of progressive growing thing
[04:07:50] <RiversHaveWings> nshepperd: in the middle? huh
[04:08:02] <RiversHaveWings> that might be better
[04:09:38] <RiversHaveWings> anyway i'm about to go to bed
[04:09:43] <RiversHaveWings> mb can figure it out in the morning
[04:10:19] <nshepperd> nightnight :)
[04:10:43] <gwern> just adding a new resolution/block and continuing to train end to end is the simplest thing -_-
[04:11:37] <RiversHaveWings> What do I do with the 3-channel inputs and outputs though.
[04:12:54] <gwern> what inputs/outputs do you have besides rgb pixels?
[04:13:48] <RiversHaveWings> The lower res U-Net stages have high dimensional inputs and outputs.
[04:14:18] <RiversHaveWings> Like would I have toRGB and fromRGB layers that I remove
[04:14:51] <RiversHaveWings> When I grow the net
[04:15:43] <gwern> I would just take the sr3 approach of having toRGB plug into fromRGB at each resolution/layer
[04:15:48] <RiversHaveWings> Ugh
[04:16:07] <gwern> sr3 argues that the quasi-bottleneck is a benefit
[04:16:08] <RiversHaveWings> No bottlenecks pls
[04:16:40] <gwern> aren't you the one arguing for completely separate upscalers
[04:16:56] <gwern> don't lecture me about bottlenecks when you're happily throwing end-to-endness out 
[04:17:19] <RiversHaveWings> We tried upscalers but they were bad
[04:17:53] <RiversHaveWings> Upscalers are hard to guide with CLIP.
[04:18:15] <RiversHaveWings> I was going to try to work out why just training a single high-res model wasn't working well.
[04:19:34] <RiversHaveWings> Since it should be better than base + upscaler cascades.
[04:19:36] <gwern> well, the usual arguments for progressive growing is that it offers a nice efficiency gain because you can do most of the training at low res, and it can stabilize finicky archs like GANs. diffusion is stable, so the second argument doesn't appear to matter, and it's all about saving compute. if you're willing to waste compute, you can just train a single high res model from the start, sure
[04:19:48] <RiversHaveWings> Even if it takes longer to train it should be better once it finishes.
[04:20:21] <RiversHaveWings> Ah.
[04:20:22] <gwern> I don't know if we have any reason atm to expect a difference at convergence (modulo the compute savings) for diffusion
[04:20:45] <gwern> (for GANs, of course, progressive usually gets you better final results as well as faster results, because they're so unstable and learn badly)
[04:21:17] <RiversHaveWings> Maybe it's just something simple like needing to adjust the noise schedule/start at a lower snr and spend more time there with high res models.
[04:22:43] <RiversHaveWings> Since when you do base + upscaler you're implicitly using a shifted noise schedule when you do the sampling from the base model.
[04:23:29] <RiversHaveWings> And training it w/ the same shifted schedule.
[04:25:01] <nshepperd> hm. plotting the distribution of q_sample(image, starting noise level).mean() against a standard normal should give some idea of whether the starting snr is low enough? maybe
[04:25:21] <nshepperd> like the distribution over the dataset

Jessica was (I don't know if she still is) part of a group centered around a person named Vassar, informally dubbed "the Vassarites". …)
[05:15:56] <saturn2> "Ziz tried to create an anti-CFAR/​MIRI splinter group whose members had mental breakdowns. Jessica also tried to create an anti-CFAR/​MIRI splinter group and had a mental breakdown. This isn’t a coincidence—Vassar tried his jailbreaking thing on both of them, and it tended to reliably produce people who started crusades against MIRI/​CFAR, and who had mental breakdowns."

Devi had a mental breakdown and detransitioned IIHC. Jessica had a mental breakdown and didn’t detransition. Olivia became an agent of mental breakdown, compulsively breaking others via drug trips because they went through gates they
[05:21:17] <saturn2> shouldn’t’ve. And didn’t detransition. This all created an awful tension in me."

[05:25:50] <saturn2> blame/​ostracize/​cancel him and his group, except maybe from especially sensitive situations full of especially vulnerable people.

[06:47:49] <quanticle> But maybe I'm wrong! Obormot\Arcturus, as an *actual person from the Soviet Union*, are you nostalgic for bread lines? Do you miss the sense of community they fostered?
[06:49:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> no
[06:49:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> This is the most insane take I've seen in a while
[06:50:10] <Obormot\Arcturus> The idea that lines for bread and such "fostered a sense of community" is *wildly* wrong

[07:34:45] <adiabatty> quanticle: tell me more about your opinions on filesystem metadata
[07:35:42] <quanticle> adiabatty: Oh, not really much to say. I was just looking over my giant pile of Youtube downloads and thinking, "You know, it would be nice if all this metadata about the videos could be stored in some kind of structured format rather than crammed into the filename"
[07:36:55] <quanticle> And no, you can't just store it as metadata in the file format itself, because when you download the highest quality version of the video from YouTube, you might get h264+aac (which you can combine into a MP4 container), but you also might get webm, which you then have to combine into mkv
[07:37:44] <adiabatty> you don't want HFS+/APFS, you want BFS
[07:38:27] <quanticle> No, what I actually want is WinFS: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WinFS
[07:38:28] <Robomot> WinFS - Wikipedia (WinFS (short for Windows Future Storage)[1] was the code name for a canceled[2] data storage and management system project based on relational databases, developed by Microsoft and first demonstrated in 2003 as an advanced storage subsystem for the Microsoft Windows operating system, designed for persistence and management of structured, semi-structured and unstructured data. …)
[07:38:58] <quanticle> The WinFS concept was so cool, and I'm still annoyed that it never went anywhere.
[07:39:32] <adiabatty> if this discussion were happening in my personal Discord I would be adding a Redmond, WA city flag to the list of emoji so I could respond to that link with it
[07:39:39] <saturn2> h264 and aac can also go in a mkv container
[07:41:03] <Obormot\Gaia> quanticle: Oh? Why this time?
[07:41:19] <quanticle> Hmmm... maybe that's what I should do. Standardize on .mkv, and use ffmpeg to batch copy the audio and video streams from the .mp4 containers to .mkv containers with the same name
[07:41:22] <Obormot\Gaia> quanticle: Ah yes I see
[07:41:24] <quanticle> And then add metadata
[07:46:22] <quanticle> I legitimately wonder how much of the extremely skewed view of management that all these LessWrong folks take as given comes from the fact that these people have never actually worked a normal job in their life.
[07:47:16] <quanticle> My perception of LessWrong employment is that it's bimodal, with one peak of people working at e.g. Google and various SV startups and another peak of people who are functionally unemployed and unemployable

[08:44:30] <ggreer> I'm not sure what the point of this breaking change was. yes the encoding argument has been useless since 3.1, but it does no harm to just leave it

[08:46:16] <quanticle> Windows build numbers encode dates
[08:46:29] <quanticle> So they're not strictly an autoincrementing integer
[08:46:55] <PlanckWalk> ggreer: Is that ... is that ... a semantic version number?  Where the leftmost is backward-incompatible changes?
[08:47:15] <ggreer> I think the joke is that they always break shit. I worked there and I don't know what the version numbers meant
[08:47:41] <PlanckWalk> Oh haha.  Interesting to hear you worked there :)
[08:48:06] <ggreer> I don't remember there being breaking changes for customers
[08:48:24] <ggreer> so maybe the joke was that they never break anything, so you never have to worry about the major version
[08:49:44] <ggreer> it was mostly just an auto-updating kernel and container runtime. not much surface area *to* break. also rollouts were gradual and halting them was automatic, so if you ran a bunch of cattle servers you'd have no issues
[08:50:40] <adiabatic> "cattle servers" as opposed to a small handful of pet servers?
[08:50:56] <ggreer> yeah

[08:58:42] <quanticle> tl;dr: The Windows build "number" is more like a packed bitfield than an integer
[09:00:28] <ggreer> what a weird way to store the version
[09:00:53] <ggreer> why compress it so much? it's not like it's used in control flow all over the OS
[09:04:43] <quanticle> https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/technet-magazine/jj663498(v=msdn.10)?redirectedfrom=MSDN <-- Also sometimes the build number is an easter egg
[09:04:44] <Robomot> Windows Confidential: Numerology of the build | Microsoft Docs
[09:06:16] <quanticle> "Elsewhere on the Microsoft Redmond, Wash., campus, another team in 1993 was finishing up work on Windows 95. That OS was finally shipped as build 950. This was a cute number, as it was of course a play on 95. [...] The versions of Windows based on Windows 95 carried forward this tradition of giving the final build a cute build number. Windows 98 was build 1,998. [...] Developers revived that
[09:06:18] <quanticle> proud tradition during the development of Windows XP. The final build number for Windows XP was set at 2,600, a reference to the hacker magazine."
[09:07:59] <adiabatic> bitfields were probably way more popular back in 1990 or whenever windows 1.0 was a thing
[09:09:04] <quanticle> Actually, interestingly enough, back in the Win 3.1 days, the build number was a normal auto-incrementing integer
[09:09:37] <quanticle> Or rather, it was more like a set of integer ranges, where you'd have an offset for your production builds to leave room for beta builds
[09:10:01] <quanticle> So if your beta builds started at e.g. 300 you'd start your production builds at 500 or whateber
[09:10:04] <quanticle> *whatever
[09:10:16] <TheWhisper> GROPOS is a tough episode to watch :( 
[09:10:31] <quanticle> It looks like it switched to the packed bitfield sometime around the Windows XP era.

[09:30:00] <feep[work]> at some point I'd really like if we had a think about what happened with shawwn
[09:30:16] <feep[work]> cause like, I missed the start of the drama, but apparently telling channel members to shut up is not okay.
[09:30:27] <feep[work]> which is cool and all
[09:31:25] <feep[work]> but um
[09:31:32] <feep[work]> [Sonntag, 10. Oktober 2021] [00:24:12 CEST] <shawwwn>   feep, please go into the bathroom, take a shit, smear that shit all over some toilet paper, and then take a good long lick
[09:31:57] <feep[work]> and this was not a new thing, that's just the most recent thing I remember
[09:32:10] <feep[work]> again, I am super okay with the conversational norm espoused here!
[09:32:13] <feep[work]> it just seems to come out of nowhere.
[09:33:31] <feep[work]> if we could do that more, and more consistently, I think that'd be great, but I do think it's odd how we *haven't* done it before now.
[09:33:50] <feep[work]> because shawwn being pointlessly aggressive to people over a perceived slight is **not** a new thing.
[09:34:21] <feep[work]> like, I'd sort of settled into "I guess we just do that thing when it comes from people who do ml"
[09:34:26] <feep[work]> we just tolerate*
[09:35:13] <feep[work]> like how -- I mean, gwern ilu and I think you're great, but objectively I think you could get away with pretty much any behavior
[09:35:45] <feep[work]> just because you add so much value that it would outweigh all but the most egregious of behavior, and I thought we were in a mode of like
[09:35:57] <feep[work]> "almost any value add outweighs almost all bad behavior"
[09:36:31] <feep[work]> cause that's what interacting with shawwn calibrated me to expect.
[09:36:56] <feep[work]> so, you know. bit of consistency would be nice.
[09:37:11] <quanticle> feep[work]: It was always a norm, we allowed shawwwn a limited exception because he was useful, but at some point, "We stretch the rules for you because you're useful" is no longer a sufficient justification
[09:37:30] <feep[work]> quanticle: okay, so your model is just "too much shit in too short a time"?
[09:37:38] <feep[work]> tbf I think that fits with logos01
[09:37:43] <quanticle> No, my model is eventually the shitpile got too big
[09:38:03] <feep[work]> I mean, assuming the shitpile shrinks at all, that seems equivalent
[09:38:45] <feep[work]> but I still think that's kind of bad?
[09:38:46] <quanticle> Yeah, fair enough
[09:38:53] <feep[work]> like, it seems really hard to predict what the limit is.
[09:38:54] <quanticle> No, I don't think it's bad at all 
[09:39:00] <feep[work]> or, in cases of like, logos01, that there is a limit at all.
[09:39:03] <quanticle> Like, this is just what normal human society is like
[09:39:15] <feep[work]> quanticle: okay, um, "human society is kind of bad" is not exactly a hot take.
[09:39:29] <quanticle> Not exactly a hot take, but not exactly something I agree with either
[09:39:54] <feep[work]> okay, can we compromise on "human society is bad for the neuroatypical"?
[09:40:00] <feep[work]> that should be uncontroversial
[09:40:40] <quanticle> Only if you admit the flip side, which is that the neuroatypical is bad for human society
[09:40:47] <feep[work]> quanticle: like, I'm trying to draw the line of my desired policy so that it reacts correctly to both logos01 and shawwn, who have almost diametrally opposed conflicts
[09:41:07] <quanticle> Like, my views are and have been clear. I did *not* see shawwwn as a positive contributor to the channle
[09:41:09] <quanticle> *channel
[09:41:18] <feep[work]> afaict the problem with logos01 was that he was not given any guidance signal short of banning
[09:41:39] <feep[work]> and the problem with shawwn is that having completely ignored any guidance signals, it took us two years to ban him
[09:41:46] <quanticle> Yeah, that's fair
[09:42:41] <feep[work]> I just think the "pile of shit" model is ... not ... good?
[09:42:56] <quanticle> And re: "gwern can get away with anything" I'm not sure
[09:43:17] <feep[work]> like, I think it works fine if you can see the pile of shit you produce and use it as a guidance signal
[09:43:17] <quanticle> We give gwern leeway w.r.t. gwernpastes and the like because we know he won't be egregiously bad with that power
[09:43:24] <feep[work]> but so it lets down exactly the sort of people who most need it.
[09:43:43] <quanticle> And also because he doesn't do anything else like launch long expletive filled rants at people who happen to tell him off just a tiny bit
[09:43:57] <feep[work]> quanticle: I mean, it also happens to be the case that gwern is generally a good person.
[09:44:01] <quanticle> Yes
[09:44:09] <quanticle> Well, I don't think shawwwn is a bad person
[09:44:09] <ggreer> it's kind of weird that greer.com is just a domain parking page. it doesn't even say it's for sale
[09:44:14] <quanticle> I think he's just psychotic sometimes
[09:44:23] <ggreer> I figured it was owned by some rich old greer, or some company with the name
[09:45:04] <quanticle> ggreer: Your aspiration, should you choose to accept it: become rich enough to register .greer as a TLD with ICANN
[09:45:06] <nshepperd2> tbh what happened is i was already annoyed (not at shawwwn) bc of a different thing, and that led me to ask shawwwn to be more respectful, and he refused
[09:45:06] <ggreer> whois info is just network solutions. it's not even clear who to contact to ask if it's for sale
[09:45:10] <ggreer> XD
[09:45:16] <nshepperd2> which means this will keep happening
[09:45:29] <ggreer> I mean I'd probably get greer.com if it was a few grand
[09:45:40] <feep[work]> brb
[09:45:59] <quanticle> Well, the initial acquisition cost isn't bad. The problem is that if its one of those domains, it turns into a few grand every year.

[09:46:20] <ggreer> oh GTLDs, yeah
[09:46:33] <quanticle> No, I meant for greer.com as well
[09:46:47] <ggreer> what? renewing a .com is the standard amount
[09:46:50] <quanticle> Like if it's a few grand every year to hold greer.com (I don't know why it would be, but who knows)
[09:46:59] <quanticle> Oh
[09:47:04] <ggreer> someone just managed to register it in 1996
[09:47:17] <quanticle> Wow, and they've been renewing it ever since?
[09:47:31] <ggreer> it's probably been handed around a decent amount, but yeah

[09:55:28] <quanticle> And w.r.t. what feep is saying about "human society being not great for neuroatypicals" my reply is that there are certain people who, when offered help, find greater pleasure in throwing that back in your face than actually getting better; for those people you can do nothing

[10:17:31] <kuudes> I don't defend shawwn against this ban because it seems to me that this was his clear preferred outcome
[10:17:43] <kuudes> I have no model where this would have been prevented
[10:18:59] <kuudes> gwern seems to manage it by discounting shawwn's agency - ie the whole "dog" mapping
[10:19:31] <Gurkenglas> sounds like an outcome i would prefer, in his situation.

[10:25:17] <Gurkenglas> i assume he will be unbanned if he ever asks and he knows this so *shrug*
[10:25:29] <kuudes> I guess I would move it from +b to +q against his wishes
[10:26:24] <kuudes> I don't see any reason to ban him from being present on channel and reading gwernpastes etc, and I don't see there a right to request a +b for self in this case
[10:27:09] <Gurkenglas> (but and he doesn't want to ask, butbut he also prefers not to be easily able to join so that all works out)
[10:27:23] <kuudes> maybe even just unban him in a couple of days, though my mental model says his masochistic machinery will just escalate this
[10:27:53] <kuudes> Gurkenglas, I see no reason to honor his wishes in that
[10:28:19] <Gurkenglas> kuudes, how do you choose when to honor wishes?
[10:28:42] <kuudes> cooperant people get their needs more acknowledged, uncooperant people get pushed against
[10:29:19] <kuudes> shawwn is not being cooperative in this. if he were, he wouldn't seek getting banned
[10:29:46] <kuudes> but I would let gwern decide when to lift the ban, shawwn is his pet, and for a reason
[10:30:32] <kuudes> in any case, I am sad. shawwn is a fun guy and a productive and interesting person. I would wish for him to be around and shine
[10:32:23] <kuudes> whereas for logos01 I would hope someone would engineer a clear rule or name a handler for him, and I think he is cooperative and can use such an aid device
[10:33:19] <kuudes> ie logos01 does not seek to be antisocial, I model him as seeking to be prosocial but lacking some of the mechanisms. so providing him with such a mechanism likely would work, as he seems extremely able to follow blindly a rule he agrees to
[10:33:20] <Gurkenglas> i see. i think you should generalize "people" to "made of component people" and then generalize "un/cooperant" along with it
[10:34:19] <kuudes> sure. but the actively uncooperative component person in shawwn is currently dominant, and there is no reason to play along with them
[10:34:24] <Gurkenglas> (such that the obvious associativity axioms hold, etc.)
[10:34:52] <kuudes> but re logos I would think he would obey a simple safe word system etc
[10:35:26] <Gurkenglas> i expect shawwwn's component that prefers being banned is different from the component that talks shit?
[10:35:51] <kuudes> yeah, shittalker is the tool
[10:36:30] <kuudes> but the prefers-to-be-banned component has no just reason to expect us to cooperate with them
[10:36:59] <Obormot\Arcturus> I just don't understand how "tolerate saying <the sort of stuff shawwn routinely says to people at the drop of a hat>" is even on the table, in any remotely civilized social space or whatever
[10:37:12] <kuudes> if they would have just asked before the convo "I would like to get banned" then that seems like a cooperative action
[10:37:20] <Obormot\Gaia> Like the thing feep quoted a little earlier
[10:37:46] <kuudes> I model it as sort of tourette's or something
[10:38:03] <Obormot\Gaia> If it were me and someone said that, I'd be like "lol are you fucking serious? absolutely never say anything like that again to anyone here or else instant ban"
[10:39:20] <kuudes> well his sayings and actions do not coordinate on the actual level. ie he does not actually behave strategically as one is expected to behave if they really hold a true belief on the thing they say
[10:40:03] <kuudes> if only there was some way to spray him with oxytocin when he starts that mode, or something...
[10:41:36] <Gurkenglas> there's probably an irc client that you can set up to badword filter for you
[10:41:55] <kuudes> he would go around it when in tilt
[10:42:04] <Obormot\Arcturus> The mods are my badword filter
[10:43:16] <feep[work]> Obormot\Arcturus: yeah my disagreement is not at all with like, the actual banning
[10:43:32] <feep[work]> I just have a bit of whiplash because, from the, you know
[10:43:34] <kuudes> nshepperd2, saturn2 I guess it might be useful to test a day or two quiet for him and then remove that in hopes this was a random tilt. but I fear his network that causes this may have too good of stability
[10:43:35] <feep[work]> frequent previous times
[10:43:40] <feep[work]> I assumed this was just something we tolerated.
[10:44:12] <saturn2> kuudes: this isn't a new thing, feep is right
[10:44:17] <kuudes> I know
[10:44:37] <Gurkenglas> Obormot im not saying you set up a badword filter to censor him, i say he sets it up to censor himself ("gpt predicts you are tilting, try again and also the sensitivity has been temporarily increased")
[10:44:58] <kuudes> Gurkenglas, he is not cooperative to do that
[10:45:05] <kuudes> or at least I predict he is not
[10:45:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> What is this "tilting" business
[10:47:12] <kuudes> when person is in suboptimal state, such as loss of sleep or loss of food etc, often their prefrontal lobe gets weaker and stuff they manage to silent in better times become dominant
[10:47:28] <kuudes> and shawwn is apparently about the whole time in lack of sleep
[10:47:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> Sounds like an excuse to me
[10:47:57] <kuudes> partly yes
[10:48:13] <feep[work]> any explanation is also an excuse
[10:48:23] <Gurkenglas> as in, he deliberately makes himself less able to respond to incentives? perhaps. what's the progress on debugging his sleep thing
[10:48:44] <kuudes> with many people there is this thing that other people can learn to recognize the tilt and there may be things with which you can then prevent the tilt to continue
[10:48:52] <kuudes> such as by saying "you are tired. go to sleep!"
[10:51:19] <Obormot\Arcturus> Or
[10:51:23] <Obormot\Arcturus> Here's an alternative take:
[10:51:33] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's not acceptable to behave like that under any circumstances
[10:51:38] <Obormot\Arcturus> No matter how sleep deprived you are
[10:51:45] <feep[work]> also I'm just mad at myself right now
[10:51:55] <feep[work]> because I called this outcome two years ago
[10:51:56] <Obormot\Arcturus> And if sleep deprivation makes you behave like that, then just fucking stay off IRC
[10:51:58] <feep[work]> and I didn't put it in text.
[10:52:36] <feep[work]> though also to be fair, it did not end in the way I expected.
[10:52:42] <saturn2> i don't think anyone is terribly surprised here
[10:53:13] <feep[work]> I want to propose a rule, but I don't know if I actually espouse it
[10:53:20] <feep[work]> I just want to put it out there for consideration
[10:53:30] <feep[work]> "If you know you're gonna ban someone in a few years, you should just ban them immediately."
[10:53:55] <Gurkenglas> Obormot\Arcturus, is it then acceptable to instead keep yourself non-sleep-deprived?
[10:55:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> Uh sure I guess
[10:55:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> The point is, social norms and standards concern behavior
[10:55:20] <Obormot\Arcturus> Not, like... implementation details
[10:56:22] <Gurkenglas> suppose you know someone would always cooperate. do you defect?

[10:57:13] <feep[work]> yes
[10:57:34] <feep[work]> I really think people have the wrong intuition about "people who always cooperate"
[10:57:42] <feep[work]> something who always cooperates isn't a person, it's a natural resource.
[10:57:43] <Gurkenglas> (the argument im guessing Obormot might like for cooperation here being that he doesn't want to depend on someone would do in *counterfactual* circumstances)
[10:58:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> This seems like a sudden topic change
[10:58:22] <feep[work]> just a pet peeve, sorry, disregard me
[10:58:29] <saturn2> Gurkenglas: it's simple, he just wants unacceptable behavior to not happen
[10:58:34] <Obormot\Arcturus> ^
[11:00:13] <Gurkenglas> Right! And if you were to prefer unacceptable behavior to happen *nowhere* then kicking someone who then goes to do it elsewhere doesn't help, but kicking someone who responds to incentives does, and kicking someone who has deliberately made themselves unresponsive to incentives also does
[11:00:45] <Obormot\Arcturus> wat
[11:00:50] <feep[work]> kicking someone totally helps
[11:00:55] <feep[work]> they will stop doing it in your causal bubble
[11:00:58] <Obormot\Arcturus> ^
[11:01:11] <feep[work]> also um
[11:01:17] <feep[work]> unacceptable behavior is not a conserved quantity.
[11:01:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yeah maybe that behavior is acceptable somewhere else
[11:01:29] <Gurkenglas> feep, yeah that's why i specified "were to prefer it to happen nowhere", but yeah if that assumption doesn't hold your policy works out :P

[11:04:57] <Gurkenglas> <feep[work]> something who always cooperates isn't a person, it's a natural resource. <- careful not to assign 100% to that! certainly you should defect against natural ressources, but there are also agents that go like "okay so i could press this defect button that always produces one utility but oh look the environment contains another thing that i could-have-been and that always loses two utility, nice 
[11:04:57] <Gurkenglas> trick. never defect" and then, well, do you cooperate? :P

[12:24:10] <feep[work]> huh. okay, "actually, we changed our mind, shawwn does not deserve to be banned" was not on my bingo card.
[12:24:52] <feep[work]> like--
[12:25:49] <feep[work]> I know this is oversimplification, and my emotional relation to logos01 playing into it, but it seems like it's -- a *lot* easier -- to get banned for being autistic and/or wrong than for being an asshole
[12:26:17] <shawwwn> fwiw, it never once occurred to me that I might be receiving special treatment
[12:26:49] <feep[work]> shawwwn: like ... you didn't notice that nobody else was insulting or going off and attacking anybody else here, or you didn't think that was a meaningful category of interaction
[12:26:52] <shawwwn> just never crossed my mind that such an obviously absurd thing would even happen. Otherwise I would've treated my position with a little more respect.
[12:27:10] <feep[work]> I mean, it weirds me out too
[12:27:40] <feep[work]> it weirded me out when you told me to literally go eat shit in graphic detail and didn't get banned, and I didn't understand it at the time, and I still don't understand it
[12:27:49] <feep[work]> it feels like it *must* be the case that you're getting special treatment
[12:28:10] <feep[work]> but I don't have a model of why.
[12:28:27] <shawwwn> feep, we already went through this. If you intentionally bully someone, you can't be too surprised when they fight back.
[12:28:42] <feep[work]> I understand that you believe that this is what you were doing
[12:28:44] <shawwwn> as for why it didn't result in a ban, I don't know. But quoting me out of context is intellectually dishonest
[12:28:48] <feep[work]> what I don't understand is why anyone else would agree.
[12:29:02] <feep[work]> and I don't think they do
[12:29:16] <feep[work]> so given that constraint, it has to be the case that like
[12:29:22] <feep[work]> being wrong about air conditioners is banworthy
[12:29:26] <feep[work]> but straight up graphic insults is not
[12:29:29] <shawwwn> because you were dismissing my experiences as a victim, and saying that it was "just drama," when I was here to confront gwern. Because either I confront him here about it, or on twitter about it.
[12:29:44] <feep[work]> look, again, I understand your narrative of it.
[12:29:47] <shawwwn> and I really didn't want to tear him a new one publicly for minimizing a victim's experiences.
[12:29:53] <shawwwn> It's not a "narrative," feep
[12:29:53] <feep[work]> but I don't believe that it's the narrative driving mod decisions.
[12:30:07] <feep[work]> everything's a narrative.
[12:30:09] <shawwwn> you were a complete asshole by coming in out of nowhere and saying "oh is shawn just starting stupid drama again?"
[12:30:22] <shawwwn> you had no idea whatsoever, and you didn't even bother to try to find out
[12:30:22] <feep[work]> mate I've been accusing you of starting stupid drama from day one
[12:30:31] <feep[work]> and I've seen nothing to disprove this.
[12:30:50] <shawwwn> yes, and that particular day at that specific time happened to be a very hard time, when I was dealing with a genuine issue.
[12:31:01] <feep[work]> nice excuse, still insult.
[12:31:33] <shawwwn> I'm not sorry that I told you to go eat shit in response. If you feel I am starting drama, please /ignore me, and I'll do the same for you.
[12:31:33] <feep[work]> anyway, that all doesn't matter because I don't think your model of what happened matters to the mods.
[12:31:46] <shawwwn> as for your friend, I do hope that Logos gets another chance.
[12:31:55] <feep[work]> and I'm saying I don't understand *their* behavior, not yours.
[12:31:57] <shawwwn> it sounds like he deserves one, since it's been some time.
[12:35:41] <nshepperd2> feep[work]: idk, just anxiety that i'm doing the wrong thing mostly
[12:35:58] <feep[work]> nshepperd2: okay, that's relatable, but like, there are other mods
[12:37:16] <feep[work]> and it's a thing of -- I *see* the social dynamic at play, where shawwwn is-- no offense, shawwwn-- both a dick and imo a genuine risk to the stability of the community, and he keeps blowing up and saying stupid shit and doubling down and never apologizing and nothing *ever* comes of it.
[12:37:30] <feep[work]> like, it feels like there *has* to be some social dynamic going on to allow this.
[12:37:41] <feep[work]> but I have no idea what it is.
[12:37:45] <feep[work]> and that's a bit bewildering.
[12:37:54] <shawwwn> look.
[12:38:29] <shawwwn> if you feel sour about it, place me on /ignore. otherwise let's let the past be the past. there are multiple factors at play here, and it's not necessary for everyone to share every single aspect with you.
[12:38:44] <feep[work]> I want to understand what is happening.
[12:39:11] <shawwwn> what is happening is that everyone has reached an equitable outcome, and it would be super nice if you'd stop rocking the boat
[12:39:34] <shawwwn> if you want your friend to get another chance, that can happen too. you just have to ask people whether they feel it's appropriate.
[12:39:48] <feep[work]> I don't care about the specific playout of the social interaction.
[12:39:54] <feep[work]> I just want to see the gears.
[12:40:08] <saturn2> it seemed pretty unanimous that you deserved to be banned
[12:40:31] <shawwwn> and yet, not a single reason was given. Isn't that interesting?
[12:40:39] <feep[work]> I ... um
[12:40:41] <shawwwn> Other than "people have a problem with you."
[12:40:47] <feep[work]> you know why *I* want you to be banned.
[12:40:51] <feep[work]> I've made it pretty clear, I feel.
[12:41:03] <feep[work]> I can make it clearer.
[12:41:11] <shawwwn> yes, I do. And I also know that your feelings are irrelevant. You'll celebrate when I'm gone, no doubt
[12:41:12] <saturn2> the reason is verbally attacking people in an obnoxious way
[12:41:17] <shawwwn> but you giving a reason isn't the same thing as a reason for a ban.
[12:41:22] <feep[work]> I'll give a sigh of relief. :p
[12:42:10] <feep[work]> saturn2: well, I don't even really -- like, that's a symptom, and that's true, but it's -- there's an underlying syndrome of -- like, shawwn is *really* prone to attaching itself to people in a situation and going off on others in their defense in a vicions way.
[12:42:11] <shawwwn> saturn2: I see. So, you're saying that regardless of justification, under no circumstances should anyone ever use strong language here.
[12:42:14] <feep[work]> vicious*
[12:42:45] <saturn2> shawwwn: it depends on how annoying it is
[12:42:57] <feep[work]> like, earlier it was mentioned to spray him with oxytocin when he goes like this, and I wanted to say "I really don't think that will help!" because I think excessive adhoc ingroup defensiveness *is the problem.*
[12:43:23] <shawwwn> there is no problem. the problem exists in your mind.
[12:43:40] <shawwwn> the problem would also be resolved by not talking.
[12:44:06] <shawwwn> but you insist on talking about me, repeatedly, when no one else wants to have this conversation
[12:44:13] <feep[work]> I mean, yes.
[12:44:38] <shawwwn> and frankly, you keep crying to authorities instead of dealing with your issues in a direct way.
[12:44:41] <feep[work]> because I think you're definitely not the only person like this, in the long run, and I'd prefer if we had a solid theory of how to cope with the phenomenon.
[12:45:08] <feep[work]> shawwwn: I mean yeah, I'm being passive aggressive af
[12:45:11] <shawwwn> dealing with problems in a one-off manner is a fine solution. it's solved many problems over many millennia.
[12:45:23] <shawwwn> yes, you are. and I'm not sure how to get you to stop.
[12:45:37] <shawwwn> but if we rephrase it, it means you're being the annoying one, not me.
[12:45:43] <feep[work]> shawwwn: you could promise to try and get less attached and defensive of people, or to react in a less vicious way
[12:45:50] <Gurkenglas> is shawn starting drama again?                   *ducks*
[12:45:51] <shawwwn> so I think saturn2's annoyance might be better directed at you.
[12:46:19] <shawwwn> feep: or, I could tell you exactly what I'm thinking
[12:46:23] <feep[work]> shawwwn: or you could convince me that my model of your behavior is wrong, in both cases I'll feel a lot safer around you
[12:46:23] <shawwwn> I would love to
[12:46:49] <shawwwn> you don't need to feel safe around me. All you need to do is /ignore me, or stop talking about me, or literally do anything else
[12:47:01] <shawwwn> it's not necessary for other people to solve your problems for you.
[12:47:16] <feep[work]> I don't think this is a me-you issue.
[12:47:26] <shawwwn> there is no issue, friend
[12:47:38] <feep[work]> I mean, I have an issue with you, yes, so in that sense it's a me-you issue, but I think that the problem I'm vocalizing threatens everyone here that interacts with you or anyone you interact with.
[12:47:54] <shawwwn> No, I don't think so.
[12:48:01] <shawwwn> In fact, I would say that's a remarkable exaggeration
[12:48:03] <feep[work]> I mean, right, but like, that's my view.
[12:48:08] <saturn2> you've also done this with gwern and obormot and uh... probably more but i can't remember
[12:48:09] <shawwwn> yes, certainly
[12:48:18] <shawwwn> everyone is entitled to their view.
[12:48:28] <feep[work]> so from that perspective I hope it makes more sense that I'm staying on it instead of /ignore dropping the topic.
[12:48:41] <shawwwn> and obormot is entitled to /ignore me, and I agree that it was wrong of me to harass him about it. I was hurt that we used to be friends, and then we weren't.
[12:49:04] <shawwwn> So I'll cut you a deal. You ignore me, and anyone else who feels threatened ignores me too, and we'll call it even.
[12:49:13] <feep[work]> I mean.
[12:49:15] <feep[work]> I'm for this.
[12:49:19] <shawwwn> deal
[12:49:23] <feep[work]> no hang on but like
[12:49:33] * shawwwn sighs
[12:49:34] <feep[work]> the problem is my efforts to proselytize for /ignore have so far met with limited success.
[12:49:50] <feep[work]> for some reason people don't want to use the easy way to make their problems disappear
[12:49:52] <shawwwn> I don't know what proselytize means.
[12:50:01] <feep[work]> I don't u-- like, vocally advocate for
[12:50:07] <feep[work]> connotations of ideological persuasion
[12:50:15] <Gurkenglas> can we make it so it's publicly obvious who has ignored whom
[12:50:30] <shawwwn> by your own admission, you have a problem with me. this problem is resolved by you /ignoring me.
[12:50:35] <feep[work]> no
[12:50:40] <shawwwn> if others have a problem, they, too, can /ignore me.
[12:50:46] <shawwwn> yes, feep, that is actually the situation.
[12:50:55] <feep[work]> I mean, part of it is, but the part where you'll have problematic interactions with others here isn't, and I *want* them to /ignore you
[12:51:02] <feep[work]> but for some reason they refuse to
[12:51:09] <shawwwn> who?
[12:51:09] <feep[work]> like, categorically
[12:51:15] <shawwwn> name them.

[12:51:27] <feep[work]> uh, I can't grep the log rn but I clearly remember a bunch of people having objections to /ignore
[12:51:30] <cpopell> I am no longer a regular user here, but it seems to me that 'don't use strong language in an aggressive way against someone, especially when they ask you not to' is not a particularly high bar. And asking everyone to ignore you is, essentially, a piecemeal ban and leaves negative interactions to accumulate over time and sidetrack conversations, etc.
[12:51:52] <cpopell> IME ignore is best for personal grudges
[12:52:21] <saturn2> more and more people are saying this
[12:52:38] <shawwwn> yes, and you'll notice that I was in fact banned for strong language, and that there has been no strong language since it was lifted.
[12:52:55] <shawwwn> I suggest waiting to see if that remains true before inventing theories of reality.
[12:52:59] <Filipepe> hi shawwwn
[12:53:03] <shawwwn> Hi Filipepe
[12:53:09] <shawwwn> you don't still think I'm 16, right? That was a joke
[12:53:10] <feep[work]> okay, this is my model of what will happen:
[12:53:13] <saturn2> do you promise to never use strong language again here?
[12:53:14] <shawwwn> feep
[12:53:16] <shawwwn> give it a rest
[12:53:29] <shawwwn> saturn2, it depends whether you're pointing a rifle at me as you ask me that
[12:53:44] <feep[work]> you will get it in your head that you need to defend someone here from someone else, and you will want to hurt the "attacker" in self-defense. it doesn't matter whether strong language is forbidden, because you will find other ways to hurt them.
[12:53:46] <shawwwn> obviously, yes, if /ban shawwwn  is the conclusion if I say "no", then of course I promise.
[12:53:54] <shawwwn> I have no choice *but* to promise.
[12:54:01] <cpopell> Sure. And I'm not enough of a user to advocate a ban either way. There's certainly people who have found my actual views uncomfortable in the past. At the same time, though -- and this isn't banworthy! -- I am reading your attitude as a very strong "I didn't do anything wrong" and that's not a particularly good sign about whether or not banning will happen again
[12:54:26] *** Joins: PapuaHardyNet (apotheosis@tilde.institute)
[12:54:35] <feep[work]> if you like, make an effort to not attack people in retribution as much
[12:54:40] <feep[work]> then I'm totally fine with you.
[12:54:56] <feep[work]> that's the actual objection I Have.
[12:55:02] <shawwwn> cpopell: yes, I feel I didn't particularly do anything wrong, and I'm unwilling to be framed as someone who has. It's buying into the idea that there's a problem here.
[12:55:29] <shawwwn> I thought I was among open-minded people where we can speak our minds and act accordingly. But I seem to have been mistaken
[12:55:34] <cpopell> Okay but 'wrong' can mean 'Disrupt the social flow of an area'. There's no actual moral problem with banning people from internet spaces.
[12:55:46] <cpopell> (Constrained statement)
[12:55:52] <shawwwn> there's no problem, no. But I've been a member of that space for two years now
[12:56:00] <shawwwn> Don't I get a say? Even a small one?
[12:56:12] <shawwwn> Or does my feeling literally not matter whatsoever
[12:56:31] <cpopell> Er, are you not precisely having your say? And no, at the end of the day with the exception of channels that have some kind of formal voting mechanism, you literally only have 'persuade an op'
[12:56:47] <shawwwn> I agree.
[12:56:48] <cpopell> Otherwise IRC channels are, more or less, benevolent dictatorships.
[12:56:54] <shawwwn> yes they are.
[12:57:00] <cpopell> You are having your say now! I personally would not find it persuasive.
[12:57:02] <Filipepe> shawwwn: how old are you
[12:57:24] <saturn2> shawwwn: of course i do have the powah to ban you, but i'm trying to figure out what your deal is
[12:57:26] <shawwwn> Filipepe: 33. I'm happily married
[12:57:33] <Filipepe> ah haha
[12:57:36] <feep[work]> for the record, I've had this objection for two years already.
[12:57:38] <shawwwn> saturn2: why bother?
[12:57:45] <feep[work]> so this is not a sudden thing.
[12:57:50] <PapuaHardyNet> what is going on :/
[12:57:55] <feep[work]> I just, you know, expected it to work itself out naturally.
[12:58:03] <feep[work]> by either you chilling out or you getting banned
[12:58:04] <shawwwn> feep feels a lot of feelings, and feels the need to express those feelings.
[12:58:09] <feep[work]> but neither thing seems to be happening.
[12:58:18] <shawwwn> stop attacking me, and I'll chill.
[12:58:21] <cpopell> @saturn2 fwiw, feel free to tell me to not stick my nose in things - I haven't exactly been active here for *counts* about 4 years
[12:58:23] <saturn2> shawwwn: you often have interesting things to say, but you've also gotten much of the channel to want you gone
[12:58:34] <shawwwn> cpopell: nah, your view is actually the most reasonable one so far
[12:58:35] <feep[work]> shawwwn: my problem is exactly that I think your "attacking me" sense is dangerously overtuned.
[12:58:44] <shawwwn> if everyone felt as you do, then there'd be essentially no issue.
[12:58:54] <shawwwn> we'd collectively agree on some ground rules and move on.
[12:59:05] <Betawolf> the ground rules exist, you just break them
[12:59:15] <feep[work]> right? and get away with it!
[12:59:15] <shawwwn> really? if they exist, why not point me to them?
[12:59:26] <feep[work]> like, the natural resolution that I expected doesn't happen
[12:59:32] <shawwwn> because not once have I ever seen any set of rules.
[12:59:46] <Betawolf> notice how people say things like 'be respectful to other members' and 'don't verbally attack people over their opinions'?
[12:59:48] <shawwwn> that's the whole point of enacting a "rule".
[12:59:55] <Betawolf> wonder what they mean when they're saying those things
[13:00:37] <shawwwn> respect is earned. It's not given away.
[13:00:49] <cpopell> To be clear, I would ban you because I think that spaces like this can't have complete rules, and my very limited engagement with you makes it seem like you would try to find the edge of rules to push them. But I don't generally run open spaces for a reason.
[13:01:01] <cpopell> You don't have to respect them, you to treat them with respect.
[13:01:07] <cpopell> *You have to
[13:01:23] <shawwwn> cpopell: that's a fine way to run things.
[13:02:18] <shawwwn> if #lesswrong wanted to be generic, like every other place, then I was misinformed as to the powers of rationality.
[13:02:58] <shawwwn> I think that you have no idea what I'll do, and that your quick decision to ban someone based on your feelings is exactly what every other nepotist does.
[13:03:05] <shawwwn> when I agree to do something, I do it
[13:03:10] <saturn2> technically there is a rules page, but it's kind of narrowly tailored around problems the channel was having around 2015
[13:03:25] <feep[work]> afk lunch
[13:03:40] <cpopell> You're doing a thing again where you are asserting that rules around interpersonal interactions make a place generic, and trying to associate the positive association people here with (hypothetically) rationality with avoiding those interpersonal interactions.
[13:03:43] <shawwwn> then I suggest, for feep's peace of mind, we perhaps update those to some reasonable ones that resolve his cognitive dissonance.
[13:03:58] <shawwwn> cpopell: making an argument isn't "doing a thing."
[13:04:06] <shawwwn> you're correct that that is my view.
[13:04:35] *** Quits: Robomot (~Robomot@user/robomot) (Ping timeout: 264 seconds)
[13:04:37] <shawwwn> you're essentially arguing against having agreed-upon rules, and saying that I should just "figure it out."
[13:04:58] <shawwwn> I think that if you really believe autism exists, and if you empathize with those people, that you might want to reevaluate whether that's a good idea.
[13:05:29] <cpopell> Do you see how you're suggesting rule changes to one person of many who has a social problem with you, rather than rules that bind you? You're making an affirmative statement about feep's state of mind, that he needs it resolved, etc. Now, this is certainly reasonable, but there's the old joke about how if you meet one asshole, they're probably the asshole. But if everyone you meet is an asshole, well.

[13:07:00] <Obormot\Arcturus> This ain't hard, guys
[13:07:02] <cpopell> I think you aggressively try to redirect any criticism towards you to instead be about everyone else around you.
[13:07:18] <shawwwn> There's that "aggressively" word again.
[13:07:21] <cpopell> And that people are uncomfortable with banning you for socially aggressive behavior because of Geek Social Fallacy 1
[13:07:31] <shawwwn> I think if I was being aggressive towards you, you'd know it.
[13:07:35] <nshepperd2> shawwwn: consider "treat other members with respect" to be a rule from now on
[13:08:25] <shawwwn> that extends both ways. For example, it's absurdly disrespectful to me right now to be making me defend myself rather than going to sleep for work in 6 hours
[13:08:28] <cpopell> yep, I don't have a 'here's this particular word that I'd ban', I completely admit that vibes matter. This is true in many judicial systems.

[13:10:57] <cpopell> I was in here for like, 6 years
[13:11:06] <shawwwn> it shows.
[13:11:18] <PapuaHardyNet> lmao
[13:12:02] <cpopell> so what you're saying is that this place, with its 'boring norms' of politeness and respectfulness, ISN'T generic? haha
[13:12:10] <saturn2> cpopell: i'm only reluctant to ban him because he has this strange dr. jekyll and mr. hyde thing going on. when he's dr. jekyll i like him
[13:12:44] <shawwwn> awe, I like you too saturn2, when you're not being nepotist and feeling a rush of power.
[13:13:19] <saturn2> thanks
[13:13:32] <shawwwn> but I suppose I need to eliminate adjectives from my vocabulary, lest I run afoul of the respectfulness rule.
[13:14:00] <shawwwn> The solution is simple. feep will forever fixate on the fact that I was briefly banned and then unbanned, and he will never let it rest. Therefore there is no solution
[13:16:42] <PapuaHardyNet> lesswrong wouldn't be as fun without you shawwwn.
[13:16:48] <shawwwn> frankly, you all likely have nothing to worry about. I've been feeling for some time that your norms -- which include trash talking on scientific works and people -- are incredibly boring. The fixation on rules and procedures while espousing rationality is also boring.
[13:17:08] <shawwwn> I'd miss you too PapuaHardyNet.

[13:43:20] <feep[work]> how do you think that's a valid reply
[13:43:39] <feep[work]> whatever belief you have about what I do doesn't make it okay to misrepresent my position.
[13:43:57] <feep[work]> I think that's at the core of my problem with you, you think that your perception of being attacked justifies you in attacking others.
[13:44:02] <shawwwn> because you've consistently quoted me out of context, misrepresented my words, and twisted me into some kind of mental model of a hybrid between Putin and a really aggressive Coca Cola polar bear that runs around eating children
[13:44:17] <feep[work]> what, that's ridiculous, I don't think you're like putin
[13:44:23] <shawwwn> frankly, it's nonsense, and it exists in your head.
[13:44:33] <feep[work]> everything I believe exists in my head
[13:44:43] <shawwwn> yes. so I suggest searching behind your eyes for the probelm
[13:44:50] <shawwwn> not near me.
[13:44:55] <feep[work]> I don't think my model was wrong in the critical way.
[13:45:03] <feep[work]> my model was that you'd go off at perceived slights and attack people.
[13:45:11] <feep[work]> I feel that part was correct.
[13:45:24] <shawwwn> can you point to where I've attacked anyone since being unbanned?
[13:45:27] <shawwwn> And if not, can you be quiet?
[13:45:48] <feep[work]> no and no and it's not at all my position that you did it since being unbanned, so again, stop misrepresenting me
[13:46:02] <shawwwn> I never claimed that was your position
[13:46:08] <shawwwn> do you see how absurd this is getting?
[13:46:08] <feep[work]> I think you did it in the last two years, since I first had this concern, and I think you will do it again.
[13:46:20] <shawwwn> And I think that you should stop thinking about this
[13:46:24] <feep[work]> okay
[13:46:28] <feep[work]> (I won't tho)
[13:46:31] <shawwwn> but what either of us think really doesn't matter.
[13:46:32] <shawwwn> right.
[13:46:46] <shawwwn> so your choices are, continue to annoy the channel about it, for literally no gain
[13:46:51] <shawwwn> or pick any other topic
[13:47:00] <feep[work]> anyway, my model then predicted that you would do this, and you did, and get banned for it, and you did not
[13:47:11] <shawwwn> yes, being wrong is often hard to come to terms with
[13:47:14] <feep[work]> so again, my confusion is only tangentially about *you.*
[13:47:17] <shawwwn> I've faced similar struggles in the past.
[13:47:34] <feep[work]> I don't want an explanation from you, really; I feel I understand you and your behavior.
[13:48:01] <shawwwn> okay, except the things you're doing right now have a *direct impact* on my future in this channel, because you want an explanation from the mods
[13:48:13] <feep[work]> it's the part where attacks and insults are not tolerated that doesn't seem to be working.
[13:48:23] <shawwwn> me and the mods are cool. we've talked. they had concerns, I had concerns, we've talked it out.
[13:48:25] <feep[work]> oyeah absolutely, my *intention* is about you; my *confusion* is not.
[13:48:37] <saturn2> feep[work]: ok so what are you doing here
[13:48:39] <shawwwn> your confusion is due to the fact that there *were no rules*
[13:48:43] <shawwwn> there are now rules
[13:48:49] <saturn2> what's your question
[13:48:51] <shawwwn> once I break them, then let's talk
[13:48:57] <feep[work]> saturn2: I would like to know why shawwwn keeps doing shitty things and not facing any repercussions for them.
[13:49:03] <feep[work]> no let me clarify
[13:49:04] <shawwwn> I think I just did.
[13:49:20] <feep[work]> I would like to know why shawwwn keeps not facing any repercussions for the shitty he things he has done and will predictably continue to do.
[13:49:42] <shawwwn> Again, you seem to completely refuse to acknowledge that your behavior is the direct reason that any of it happened.
[13:49:54] <shawwwn> don't bully people and then act shocked and hurt
[13:49:59] <saturn2> he has faced some repercussions, just not the maximum repercussions
[13:50:13] <feep[work]> shawwwn: sure, cause I discount your model of it :p if the mods tell me that "telling someone to eat shit is a valid response to them saying that you're raising drama", that'll be uh

[13:51:19] <shawwwn> and so what?
[13:51:21] <feep[work]> and that this has consequences on whether people - ie. I - perceive the channel to be safe and maintained - ie. not.
[13:51:21] <shawwwn> tell me feep
[13:51:26] <shawwwn> what do you care?
[13:51:39] <shawwwn> if you don't think the channel is maintained, then go make your own
[13:51:42] <feep[work]> I've told you several times, I'm not telling you again.
[13:51:57] <shawwwn> Yes, you think that you alone need to swoop in and defend every other person who I might ever interact with
[13:52:06] <feep[work]> well nobody else seems to :v
[13:52:35] <shawwwn> just because you can't deal with the fact that you tried to bully me, I talked back to you in a rather ... smelly ... way, and then now we're both expected to act like adults and move on
[13:52:42] <shawwwn> I suggest acting like an adult and moving on
[13:53:11] <shawwwn> your arsenal includes, but is not limited to, /ignoring me and advising others to do the same
[13:53:12] <feep[work]> saturn2: like, if there's repercussions here, I'd appreciate if they were visible.
[13:53:32] <shawwwn> I've faced no repercussions for telling you off. Is that what you wanted to hear?
[13:53:36] <feep[work]> because as it stands I have no reason to believe they exist.
[13:53:39] <shawwwn> I openly acknowledge that.
[13:53:42] <feep[work]> aside people's word.
[13:53:51] <saturn2> ok so you want him banned
[13:53:56] <feep[work]> no I want legibility
[13:54:03] <shawwwn> You keep ignoring the fact that there *were no rules* at the time. There are now rules
[13:54:04] <feep[work]> and consistency
[13:54:09] <shawwwn> yes.
[13:54:18] <shawwwn> that is in fact the point of instating a rule.
[13:54:19] <feep[work]> I want a mod decision to be made whether telling someone to eat shit is okay or not!
[13:54:25] <shawwwn> it is not okay
[13:54:28] <shawwwn> it breaks the rules.
[13:55:10] <saturn2> yes
[13:55:38] <feep[work]> okay, so will you sign this: "we tolerated shawwn's behavior because we didn't explicitly tell him off, we have now told him off and repetitions will not be allowed"?
[13:55:45] <nshepperd2> for clarity, i will absolutely ban shawwwn permanently should he tell anyone to eat shit again
[13:56:19] <shawwwn> you have no idea how hard it is to resist telling you to eat shit. but I shall maintain
[13:56:43] <nshepperd2> even as a joke
[13:56:48] <shawwwn> yeah I know.
[13:56:53] <shawwwn> the era of jokes existed before feep
[13:56:56] <shawwwn> and then feep happened, so
[13:57:06] <shawwwn> I agree that rules are better for everyone.
[13:57:54] <feep[work]> okay, my new model is, and I'm making this an explicit prediction: shawwn will still end up finding some reason to think he needs to defend himself from someone here by attacking them, it will not be through the medium of graphic insults, but it will be some other way, quality will degrade, a rule will be made but only in hindsight.
[13:58:03] <feep[work]> I shall drop the topic until then.
[13:58:13] <shawwwn> how about
[13:58:38] <shawwwn> nope, I'm not going to let you bait me into getting banned
[13:58:46] <feep[work]> shit man that'd be a huge victory
[13:58:51] <shawwwn> I know right?
[13:58:59] <feep[work]> if you end up paranoid of this scenario to the extent of avoiding it strenuously
[13:59:06] <feep[work]> I'm gonna call that "mission accomplished."
[13:59:06] <shawwwn> but if you thought I bothered you before, wait till you see what I do with you now
[13:59:16] <feep[work]> shawwn come on I just made that prediction
[13:59:23] <feep[work]> at least wait five minutes
[13:59:26] <shawwwn> yep. and your prediction is wrong.
[13:59:34] <shawwwn> don't worry, you'll see.
[13:59:38] <shawwwn> something to look forward to.
[14:00:00] <Betawolf> mods: you think openly threatening to 'bother' a channel member is fine?
[14:00:12] <feep[work]> nono let him think of a clever way to get back at me
[14:00:19] <feep[work]> I have pretty thick skin.
[14:00:28] <feep[work]> I bet I can take it longer than the mods can watch.
[14:00:42] <shawwwn> feep, you have the thickest skin I've ever seen
[14:00:47] <shawwwn> it's luxuriously thick
[14:00:48] <feep[work]> thanks, it was hard work to get.
[14:00:53] <shawwwn> yeah I can tell
[14:01:16] <Gurkenglas> it's fine he's taking the nearest strategy that's not blocked by forbidding to take the nearest unblocked strategy
[14:01:36] <shawwwn> finally, a rationalist speaks up from a rationality point of view. I didn't expect that at all
[14:01:59] <shawwwn> it's really true. And feep, since you've been so obsessed with me, you can be absolutely assured that I shall now be obsessed with you
[14:02:26] <feep[work]> you'll forget about me in half a day.
[14:02:31] <shawwwn> Not this time
[14:02:37] * feep[work] shrugs
[14:02:41] <feep[work]> once again, it's only my prediction.
[14:02:54] <shawwwn> I can't think of a single true prediction you've ever made.
[14:03:03] <feep[work]> and that's why I'm not worried.
[14:03:04] <Gurkenglas> because it's more than half a day ago
[14:03:32] <shawwwn> you seem to be so consistently wrong that it would be true to say that following you around and placing bets on the opposite of your beliefs would probably yield a small yacht
[14:04:17] <feep[work]> oh, and one more thing, just to be clear: I'm not mad at you and I will not be pursuing any sort of revenge.
[14:05:05] <shawwwn> Don't worry. I'm extraordinarily angry at you, and I assure you that there's enough anger for both of us to partake.
[14:05:14] <feep[work]> okay :)

[14:18:28] <feepbot> This is not my cat… in my kitchen, on top of the cupboard, watching me cook. : cats (16,817 votes and 243 comments so far on Reddit)
[14:19:40] <feep[work]> that is not your cat, but I'm p sure that is now its cupboard.
[14:20:14] <shawwwn> I was just imagining how easy it would be to bypass your defenses by being a cat
[14:20:27] <feep[work]> it's true. I would be completely helpless.
[14:20:29] <shawwwn> the trouble is figuring out how to actually inflict harm on you when in a cat body
[14:20:41] <shawwwn> so I don't think it's a good plan.
[14:20:51] <feep[work]> shawwn if you figure out how to get a cat body I will tolerate any abuse you heap on me if you tell me the secret.
[14:21:24] <shawwwn> it's no surprise that you want to literally be a cat. I assume you've also molested a few.
[14:21:29] <shawwwn> okay, sorry.
[14:21:35] <feep[work]> XD no this is just funny.
[14:21:58] <feep[work]> like, rn I'm okay because I know you don't mean anything by it.
[14:22:37] <shawwwn> it's a reminder of just how easy it would be for you to start whining about the respectfulness rule
[14:23:07] <feep[work]> look, cat analogy?
[14:23:10] <shawwwn> and if I'm serious about how I feel about you, it'll be a marathon, so I'll have to be quite a lot smarter.
[14:23:14] <feep[work]> it's not about the pawstrike, it's about claws in vs claws out.

[14:29:04] <feep[work]> five minutes later: <feep[work]> The line must be drawn HEAAHH!!
[14:29:27] <shawwwn> feep: the fact that you consider yourself a liberal makes me question whether you actually have beliefs
[14:29:28] <feepbot> shawwwn: shawwwn left a note 4 weeks, 3 days ago: be happier. it's fine not to do everything all at once.
[14:29:51] <feep[work]> aww
[14:30:37] <shawwwn> I think any supposed system you consider yourself a part of will be instantly twisted to whatever shape you dream up.
[14:31:11] <shawwwn> you're not a liberal, or anything else. you're your own special brand of looney tunes.
[14:31:24] <shawwwn> I thought you were nice. I was wrong.
[14:31:35] <feep[work]> I am totally nice.
[14:31:37] <shawwwn> I thought you were interesting; wrong again.
[14:31:40] <shawwwn> Talented, ditto.
[14:31:53] <feep[work]> shawwwn: isn't that suspicious?
[14:32:12] <feep[work]> like, you thought all those things, and now suddenly, me having "attacked" you, you conclude that you were mistaken? why would those things be correlated?
[14:32:20] <shawwwn> I can't think of the last thing you've built that seemed to be impactful in any way
[14:32:25] <feep[work]> feepbot
[14:32:31] <RiversHaveWings> Look at those sampled manga pages!
[14:32:34] <shawwwn> not impactful.
[14:32:36] <feep[work]> it's weird, it's almost the random shit you throw together
[14:32:39] <feep[work]> always*
[14:32:51] <feep[work]> RiversHaveWings: what's the source dataset?
[14:32:54] <shawwwn> you tell yourself it's impactful probably because it gives you solace to feel that way.
[14:33:01] <feep[work]> I mean, yes?
[14:33:02] <RiversHaveWings> feep[work]: danbooru2020 512px sfw subset
[14:33:12] <feep[work]> RiversHaveWings: wait, no theme, pure danbooru? nice.
[14:33:17] <shawwwn> I don't think you're going to impact a single person outside of this chatroom, and your job.
[14:33:28] <shawwwn> it's why you obsess over both.
[14:33:30] <RiversHaveWings> That reminds me, I need to make a big one of these and train it on pictures of text and see if I can get it to generate coherent language.
[14:33:51] <feep[work]> RiversHaveWings: what is the model?
[14:34:06] <feep[work]> like, I wouldn't expect something that wasn't something like gpt to generate coherent text
[14:34:07] <RiversHaveWings> Like maybe skip the 4x4, maybe 8x8 downsampling stages and just do a ton of interleaved 2x 3x3 residual blocks and self-attention blocks at a downsampling ratio useful for language generation.
[14:34:19] <feep[work]> - oh hm, that may work
[14:34:29] <feep[work]> definitely try that :D
[14:34:30] <RiversHaveWings> feep[work]: it's a u-net with self-attention blocks at 16x16 and lower resolutions
[14:34:38] <Obormot\Arcturus> Oh shit, feep is a mod now??
[14:34:49] <feep[work]> Obormot\Arcturus: temporary for like eight hours
[14:34:54] <shawwwn> I think that it would be more effective to flip a coin than to try any of your ML suggestions.
[14:34:57] <feep[work]> I anticipate not using it.
[14:34:58] <RiversHaveWings> And it does 1000 or so steps through the model during sampling
[14:35:16] <RiversHaveWings> Like it's "autoregressive" but in a sort of generalized, low-to-high-frequencies way.
[14:35:42] <shawwwn> I can actually pinpoint the time that you stopped doing anything interesting: right when you gave up on GPT-2 things.
[14:35:44] <RiversHaveWings> Instead of going left to right like a generative LM.
[14:36:00] <Gurkenglas> we can test feep's theory. shawwwn, can you think of a negative thing about me?
[14:36:22] <shawwwn> you? heck no, lol. you're the purest person I've seen online
[14:36:39] <Gurkenglas> yep, https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ACGeaAk6KButv2xwQ/the-halo-effect

[14:36:39] <shawwwn> "stateless and pure" is the only thing that comes to mind
[14:36:40] <Robomot> The Halo Effect - LessWrong (The affect heuristic is how an overall feeling of goodness or badness)
[14:36:58] <RiversHaveWings> I already tried replacing the middle segment of a U-Net with a ViT and it didn't work well.
[14:37:25] <RiversHaveWings> The ViT segment didn't learn spatial relationships well enough.
[14:37:37] <feep[work]> Gurkenglas: yeah that's what I was thinking.
[14:38:06] <RiversHaveWings> But alternating 3x3 convs and self-attention blocks is *better* than the base residual U-Net, not worse. 
[14:38:29] <shawwwn> > implying feep thinks
[14:38:38] <RiversHaveWings> (The ViT essentially alternates 2x 1x1 conv residual blocks with self-attention blocks).
[14:38:41] <feep[work]> okay come on, that's just boring
[14:39:28] <feep[work]> RiversHaveWings: :blinks: okay, layman question
[14:39:33] <feep[work]> what's 1x1 conv?
[14:39:45] <shawwwn> don't bother. your time will be wasted
[14:39:52] <shawwwn> every time feep tries to put effort into ML, he gives up
[14:39:58] <shawwwn> a 1x1 conv is a google search away.
[14:39:59] <nshepperd2> 1x1 conv is just a pointwise linear layer in disguise
[14:40:01] <feep[work]> I'm just curious.
[14:40:04] <RiversHaveWings> feep[work]: it's a linear layer but applied pointwise to each location in a convnet feature map.
[14:40:40] <shawwwn> both of them are technically correct but with useless mental models. a 1x1 conv is how you reduce the channel count of an activation.
[14:40:57] <nshepperd2> or increase it
[14:41:12] <feep[work]> oic
[14:42:30] <shawwwn> wasted words
[14:45:16] <shawwwn> RHW: as I mentioned to someone else, the reason I said those things about your work is because I was worried to see you and gwern putting down scientific contributions just because it didn't seem very good.

[15:37:08] <ivan> why did shawwwn get unquieted again

[16:06:59] <two2thehead> yep
[16:07:19] <shawwwn> there should definitely be a taxonomy for the distinction.

[16:20:11] <shawwwn> I know, right? walking is so annoying. it's like, it's 2021, we were supposed to have something that prevents us all from being overweight and sedentary without having to put in any actual effort, like you want
[16:20:15] <catern> oh wait maybe they just aren't showing up on delivbery because it's so early
[16:21:21] <shawwwn> told you I could convince them to deliver to you
[16:21:31] <shawwwn> just have to ask at the right time
[16:22:34] <catern> no even with that clarification they don't show up. oh well!
[16:25:09] <shawwwn> I have to say, your day is particularly exciting
[16:25:52] <shawwwn> it's not even 8 AM CST, and so far you've discovered at least four new things about your quest for eating
[16:38:11] <otoburb> catern: A brisk walk will do you good. Plus, good buns in Chinatown are worth grabbing. 
[16:39:37] <kuudes> mask use is still sane

[16:45:28] <two2thehead> they should pivot their business to marijuana dispensaries. The advertising campaign writes itself
[16:45:46] <two2thehead> "We couldn't bake, so we're baking you!"
[16:46:47] <otoburb> I wonder how that translates in Chinese
[16:47:44] <otoburb> Conceptual alliteration vs. verbal alliteration.

[18:23:37] <kuudes> closely monitored; in all workplaces, all workers must undergo daily health checks and three times a week rapid antigen tests; working day onsite reduced to 6 hours; curfew between 19:00 and 06:00; increased checks and control of violations; non-essential travel limits.

[20:17:44] <shawwwn> All I need is an address, if you ever want to partake. Us furries have to stick together, you know
[20:17:46] <feep> is this the setup for a very elaborate "fuck yourself" joke or is it a setup for a pipebomb
[20:18:05] <shawwwn> There's only one way to find out! Which part of germany are you in?
[20:18:27] <feep> oh, deep hinterland. no deliveries possible, I'm afraid.
[20:18:34] <shawwwn> Gurkenglas: it's a good question. I would say the ETA for starting the process is November 29th, since that's my next dr appointment
[20:18:43] <shawwwn> ah, a shame.
[20:19:02] <PapuaHardyNet> oh man, the immense nostalgia of 2012 dating sim VN screenshots
[20:19:16] <shawwwn> See gwern, as I thought; even the postal service was like "fuck this" when they tried to go to feep's house, even with the "through rain, snow, etc" motto
[20:19:31] <gwern> :thinking_face:
[20:19:33] <PapuaHardyNet> I wish I could get myself to play dating sim VNs again without feeling like I'm wasting my time and I should work instead
[20:19:49] <gwern> maybe mail the dragon dildo to the german postal service instead. I think they'll get the implicit message of 'get fucked'
[20:24:44] <catern> will shawwwn reciprocate and give his address? if I mail him something he could get my address off the return address

[20:26:02] <shawwwn> I would absolutely love to give you, of all people, my closest friend, my address catern. It's 146 Rue Grand Dr, Lake St Louis, MO
[20:26:35] <catern> tangentially, shawwwn's apparently extremely negative reaction to me saying "this is shawwwn https://static1.e926.net/data/a0/c0/a0c0215a47df960391aac3a828c74a6a.jpg " (I guess he really doesn't like furries?) reminds me of something I was thinking, which is that probably someone walking around in a fursuit in public probably needs to be genuinely concerned about being hate-crimed, which isn't true for someone just, like, holding han
[20:26:35] <catern> with their same-sex partner
[20:26:39] <Robomot> image/jpeg (600x806; 91 KB)
[20:26:44] <gwern> that's 'captain branwen' to you
[20:26:53] <shawwwn> As you can see, the thought that you'd send me something .. improper .. 
[20:26:59] <shawwwn> never crossed my mind
[20:27:06] <shawwwn> Which is as it should be, for besties
[20:27:14] <catern> (that's homophobia for you, sublimating into weirder forms)
[20:27:28] <catern> shawwwn: cool, don't worry I won't send anything improper
[20:27:37] <shawwwn> Oh, you suffer from homophobia? I totally wasn't expecting exactly that
[20:27:44] <shawwwn> That's terrible
[20:27:58] <PapuaHardyNet> what? hate crime for wearing a furry suit?
[20:28:01] <catern> ah, no, I was saying that people's hate for furries is a sublimated homophobia
[20:28:07] <shawwwn> If there's any way I can ever help you get comfortable with your gay side, definitely let me know
[20:28:12] <PapuaHardyNet> how? 
[20:28:38] <PapuaHardyNet> I don't see the connection catern
[20:28:49] <gwern> catern: easy test: have people walk around in Lola Bunny fursuits instead
[20:28:56] <catern> well it's pretty obvious... group that's 75% LGBT... unusual sexual practices and activities... and widely hated...
[20:28:57] <shawwwn> Much like catern's friendship with me, the connection runs deep
[20:29:04] <catern> gwern: good point
[20:29:31] <pompolic> i think that argument is wrong
[20:29:42] * shawwwn pikachu face
[20:29:46] <shawwwn> catern, wrong?
[20:29:47] <pompolic> @ sublimated homophobia
[20:29:52] <PapuaHardyNet> can't you simply be disgusted by weird people?
[20:29:59] <shawwwn> I don't think catern can *be* wrong
[20:30:04] <shawwwn> it's unheard of
[20:30:23] <shawwwn> Catern.. you don't think... I mean, I always thought that you were flawless... is this not true?
[20:30:23] <pompolic> "disgusted by weird people" is also disappointing
[20:30:32] <PapuaHardyNet> but yes, violent hate for furries can be correlated with homophobia, sure
[20:31:08] <PapuaHardyNet> pompolic: hey man, I don't respect people who have sex in hot and sweaty furry suits. it's doesn't sound hot, it just sounds dumb
[20:31:11] <gwern> pompolic: well, if you're right, our lola streetwalkers will be assaulted just as often
[20:31:42] <pompolic> suppose it's time to visit a furcon to gather data
[20:32:16] <pompolic> anyway just to clarify, i mostly have nothing against furries, but subsequent lines may make it sound otherwise
[20:32:28] <pompolic> i want to quantify that "weird"
[20:32:34] <shawwwn> (lol at "mostly")
[20:32:41] <pompolic> i'll get to that
[20:33:06] <shawwwn> as a flaming gay furry, I feel deeply offended about this entire line of conversation
[20:33:11] <pompolic> the core feature of furriness, to me, seems like about having a fursona
[20:33:18] <PapuaHardyNet> which is weird
[20:33:22] <pompolic> which is, well, a furry persona
[20:33:36] <pompolic> this persona is roleplayed on the internet, at cons, etc
[20:33:51] <PapuaHardyNet> do they get sexual excitement out of it?
[20:33:52] <pompolic> i too happen to be a fan of roleplaying
[20:33:59] <PapuaHardyNet> is it like AGP, but for animals?
[20:34:15] <pompolic> i don't think they all do, but it's probably rewarding
[20:34:20] <PapuaHardyNet> I don't get it. women are sexy, identifying as a sexy woman makes you feel sexy, okay. animals aren't sexy.
[20:34:35] <ggreer> apparently some perverts disagree
[20:34:39] <pompolic> antrophomorphic animals can be and are cute
[20:34:47] <pompolic> anyway, roleplaying
[20:34:56] <catern> shawwwn: if you're a furry, what's your fursona?
[20:35:11] <feep> so you're a furry? name three fursonas.
[20:35:14] <shawwwn> nshepperd2, would you please enforce the respect rule? I am after all a gay furry, and conversations claiming that I'm not sexy are deeply disrespectful
[20:35:20] <PapuaHardyNet> catern: shawn is married to a woman, I don't think you should take that line seriously
[20:35:21] <pompolic> living out the furry identity requires roleplaying to some extent, at least currently
[20:35:42] <pompolic> i'm all for people self-modifying into rainbow wolves but last i checked we don't have the technology
[20:36:17] <PapuaHardyNet> sure, please go on, I don't get what you are trying to imply
[20:36:35] <shawwwn> My fursona is and always has been an attack helicopter
[20:36:36] <pompolic> i'm gonna have to start making up terms
[20:36:47] <catern> shawwwn: lame, you can't even stick to the bit
[20:37:02] <pompolic> anyway, this furry identity supervenes on uhhhh virtual realities that support it
[20:37:12] <shawwwn> I sexually Identify as an Attack Helicopter. Ever since I was a boy I dreamed of soaring over the oilfields dropping hot sticky loads on disgusting foreigners. People say to me that a person being a helicopter is Impossible and I'm fucking retarded but I don't care, I'm beautiful. I'm having a plastic surgeon install rotary blades, 30 mm cannons and AMG-114 Hellfire missiles on my body. From now on I want you guys to call me 
[20:37:12] <shawwwn> "Apache" and respect my right to kill from above and kill needlessly. If you can't accept me you're a heliphobe and need to check your vehicle privilege. Thank you for being so understanding.
[20:37:13] <catern> if you were really dedicated to the bit you would have a fursona
[20:37:16] <PapuaHardyNet> jesus fuck
[20:37:24] <pompolic> sometimes this is literal, c.f. second life, vrchat, furcadia, etc
[20:37:53] <PapuaHardyNet> okay, so you mean that wearing a furry suit is an extension of roleplay in society
[20:37:59] <PapuaHardyNet> which is the same as being trans
[20:38:13] <PapuaHardyNet> therefore hating people for wearing furry suits in real life is also a hate crime by analogy
[20:38:17] <pompolic> nah
[20:38:18] <PapuaHardyNet> I accept that
[20:38:26] <pompolic> but like, it's consensual LARP
[20:38:58] <pompolic> and at the edges, when there's a mixed company, some people probably don't want to play ball
[20:39:00] <ggreer> aren't most larps consensual?
[20:39:06] <pompolic> hopefully!
[20:39:17] <shawwwn> except feepxshawn
[20:39:18] <pompolic> but i think most people just LARP all the time and get mad when someone else is not playing along
[20:39:23] <gwern> I think hating furries is a pretty straightforward hate crime, yeah. it's discrimination and prejudice of a distinct group based solely on their sexual identity, one which has no particular negative externalities or affects one in any way
[20:39:35] <catern> i've never heard a transgender == LARP analogy before, interesting thought
[20:39:48] <shawwwn> speaking of consent, I guess I should probably ask once more: feep, do you have any problem with me writing intricate detailed roleplaying stories about you and me?
[20:39:51] <pompolic> i want to go on record that i didn't make that analogy
[20:39:54] <catern> (obvious in retrospect of course)
[20:40:02] <ggreer> I've been on the nonconsensual side of a larp. at burning man some furries saw my safari outfit and said "ooh you're a hunter! hunt me!" and I was tripping balls on a ton of shrooms so I could barely verbalize "uh... no" and run away
[20:40:06] <PapuaHardyNet> I made that analogy, put it on my record
[20:40:09] <pompolic> but anyway, i think negotiating the LARP boundary is where some of the ressentiment arises from
[20:40:14] <feep> please don't use my name or nick in anything you put on the internet.
[20:40:38] <shawwwn> Oh, okay. Is it okay if I take that as consent of using a stand-in name?
[20:40:45] <shawwwn> I can use peef
[20:40:49] <shawwwn> no one will ever suspect
[20:40:52] <ggreer> it was terrifying at the time but in hindsight it's an amusing memory
[20:41:21] <PapuaHardyNet> man burning man sounds fun
[20:41:22] <pompolic> brb LARPing my tauren hunter from world of warcraft at a furcon
[20:41:29] <feep> shawwwn: sure whatever
[20:41:30] <gwern> ggreer: should've told them you're a vegan and only do hunt-and-release
[20:41:34] <shawwwn> excellent!
[20:41:34] <ggreer> heh
[20:41:48] <gwern> "I just admire the imperial esthetic!"
[20:42:21] <shawwwn> This is great news. catern, would you like to be included in our peefxshawn stories?
[20:42:22] <feep> --darh vader
[20:42:38] <PapuaHardyNet> the imperium of man knows know furries
[20:42:47] <PapuaHardyNet> no* smh
[20:42:52] <pompolic> also here is the "mostly" bit: I've seen places where furries got MAD that others didn't want to talk about, idk, furry vore
[20:43:04] <ggreer> yeah furry hatred is a good litmus test for whether one is actually tolerant or not
[20:43:24] <PapuaHardyNet> depends on whether furries are your outgroup
[20:43:31] <pompolic> ^
[20:43:49] <shawwwn> yeah. it's kind of a bummer that catern rejects the idea that an attack helicopter can even be a fursona, let alone that it's my fursona
[20:43:49] <pompolic> most of my friends are wolves on the internet
[20:43:52] <gwern> PapuaHardyNet: except for the one space marine chapter we politely gloss over
[20:44:03] <ggreer> I think they're weird as hell but I also think it's bad to stop them from having their little furfests
[20:44:05] <shawwwn> but, I expect it will just take some time
[20:44:18] <pompolic> aaanyway i think the "consensual LARP" bit is actually important
[20:44:35] <gwern> (the space wolves also kill anyone who hints they are furries, which is another reason to be polite)
[20:44:49] <pompolic> at least personally i don't think socially punishing people for... not adjusting one's world model to support someone else's identity is a fair play
[20:45:54] <shawwwn> exactly
[20:46:07] <pompolic> I've been casually leafing through Richard Bartle's _Designing Virtual Worlds_, and there's a whole chapter on why people get immersed into roleplaying
[20:46:19] <pompolic> my tl;dr "identity exploration"
[20:46:21] <shawwwn> I am bummed, but I'm not advocating that we purge catern for homophobic hate
[20:46:24] <PapuaHardyNet> yeah, you talked about it. I'm beginning to consider reading it
[20:47:06] <shawwwn> we'll all just have to accept that catern's intolerance will be with us forever. But that's okay
[20:47:12] <shawwwn> like I said, besties
[20:48:05] <pompolic> i think the interesting point from it is that virtual worlds and characters/personas (these are two points on a gradient of immersion for Bartle) are intertwined
[20:48:17] <shawwwn> sigh.. "cap-tain branwen" is actually-catchy.
[20:48:19] *** Joins: adiabatty (~adiabatic@user/adiabatic)
[20:48:33] <PapuaHardyNet> really interesting
[20:48:51] <PapuaHardyNet> so to create a compelling and immersive character, you also need to create a complementary universe for the character
[20:49:00] <pompolic> i think so
[20:49:05] <PapuaHardyNet> this has massive implications for writing fiction and tulpamancy
[20:49:11] <pompolic> i know right
[20:49:18] <pompolic> and twitter!
[20:49:53] <pompolic> i think uhhhh people's reality tunnels (world-models backed by social proof and consensus) can also rightly be called virtual worlds
[20:49:57] * shawwwn TIL's tulpamancy
[20:50:00] <pompolic> so twitter is an MMO
[20:50:06] * pompolic takes a bow
[20:50:58] <gwern> shawwwn: indeed. it has the same rhythm, as well as being more correct
[20:51:14] <pompolic> i've had a consistent fictional setting to play around in, in my head, since i was 8-ish
[20:51:19] <shawwwn> but if saturn2 and nshepperd2 are part of your summoning team, gwern2 seemed the natural extension...

[20:57:27] <pompolic> that was an option to me but it was in conflict with "i made a toy world in my head" because that's a thing gods do or something
[20:57:33] <pompolic> i avoided the god complex i think
[20:58:27] <pompolic> it's hard to actually put it into words because, again, orienting by concepts only in my head

[20:58:54] <pompolic> isn't that just furries
[20:59:55] <pompolic> but yeah, to stay on concrete terms, "god created the world" is less impressive when you notice that you can do _something_ like that with not all that much effort
[21:00:28] <pompolic> (but also, obviously, whatever is in my head is not equivalent to the universe; it's contained in it, which gives an upper bound to its complexity and size)

[21:02:00] <rmmh> could be decent for GPT stuff if the neural engine is usable
[21:02:07] <pompolic> the thing you get from religion is something like "go to heaven"
[21:02:26] <pompolic> i noticed early on that i simply like exploring tiny virtual worlds
[21:02:32] <pompolic> and i went "yeah i want to do that instead"
[21:02:37] <gwern> 11tflops? that doesn't even beat a 1080ti gpu
[21:02:59] <rmmh> gwern: yeah, but lots of VRAM vOv
[21:03:00] <pompolic> but also i don't think the belief "i have a purpose in life" took root in the first place
[21:03:09] <PapuaHardyNet> interesting. so you gave up heaven for a sandbox
[21:03:37] <PapuaHardyNet> and that has other far reaching implications for how you dealth with life and the choices presented to you, I assume
[21:03:39] <pompolic> and so, Pascal's wager is defied
[21:04:02] <ggreer> the m1 max uses 60 watts
[21:04:36] <pompolic> i think overall i might have noticed more choices growing up
[21:04:50] <rmmh> wow the new MBP actually restores the good port configs
[21:05:05] <pompolic> that is to say, there are points, i believe, when people are presented with one option, or hobson's choices, or whatever
[21:05:07] <ggreer> I don't get why apple keeps their drivers secret. if macs could run other OSes apple would sell more macs
[21:05:45] <pompolic> but it's hard to come to believe "this is my only choice" when you can think of several others
[21:05:48] <gwern> but then you wouldn't be running their software
[21:05:57] <ggreer> "TouchBar has been retired for normal keys" <-- at last our long nightmare is finally over
[21:06:00] <pompolic> sorry, i think this is still too vague
[21:06:19] <PapuaHardyNet> I did get the gist of what you meant, don't worry about it
[21:06:21] <ggreer> oh wait they added a camera notch to the laptop screen

[21:06:49] <PapuaHardyNet> (suffer the notch curse, mac users, that is what you deserve)
[21:07:34] <pompolic> but keeping with the afterlife theme, your choice might be "go to heaven" or "go to hell". i don't believe in this, but dunno, if every adult around you believes in something like that, you start to wonder
[21:07:41] <pompolic> or tacitly accept it
[21:08:21] <pompolic> you can also notice that visualizing heaven is a similar mental action as visualizing your sandbox, for example
[21:09:01] <pompolic> oh oh oh, i can't believe i was missing the more grounded one
[21:09:08] <pompolic> well, "grounded"
[21:09:58] <pompolic> growing up you learn, "i am <nationality>, i belong to <culture>", but if you have access to like 3-4 imagined cultures, you might decide "no i feel more affinity for mine, why should i pick that"
[21:10:13] <pompolic> so overall, it just gives more options i think
[21:11:15] <PapuaHardyNet> was this paracosm an inner citadel for you?
[21:11:37] <PapuaHardyNet> one that you would retreat to, to recover and think through things and refresh yourself?
[21:11:48] <ggreer> weird that they'd make the notch so big but not have face id
[21:11:51] <pompolic> i only later started using it for such purposes i think
[21:11:55] <ggreer> also I think they removed touch id from the keyboard
[21:12:10] <ggreer> nevermind it's in the upper right
[21:12:14] <PapuaHardyNet> well, if you did achieve it, you achieved what stoicism and buddhism have promised you shall have only after ardous mentla training
[21:12:18] <pompolic> when people tried to transmit their culture at me and i didn't like it
[21:12:23] <pompolic> may be so
[21:12:26] <PapuaHardyNet> and what christianity promised only after you die
[21:12:53] <pompolic> but if i start with "I'm Enlightened yo" then i just make a fool of myself
[21:12:58] <pompolic> it just turned me atheist lol
[21:13:17] <pompolic> "god's ways can't be known" WELL ACTUALLY
[21:13:25] <pompolic> anyway i found the thing i wanted to link: https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/04/15/things-i-learned-by-spending-five-thousand-years-in-an-alternate-universe/

As the idea gradually came into contact with reality, it degenerated int…)
[21:13:28] <pompolic> i think this is relevant
[21:13:45] <pompolic> "So far in thirteen years we’ve only had one person totally lose touch with reality and start believing his country was real and worshipping the deities of his own constructed religion and whatnot"
[21:13:51] <pompolic> i found this especially funny
[21:14:47] <pompolic> this was probably the post that made me commit to reading SSC when i found it in ~2014
[21:15:44] <pompolic> i also have a non-negligible prior on it being possible to meme yourself into mild psychosis with it
[21:16:27] <PapuaHardyNet> that actually motivated me to click the link
[21:17:26] <pompolic> anyway to sum up the insane people ramblings: i think you can get out from under some culturally-imposed defaults wrt identity, because they are not the only option you see
[21:18:38] <shawwwn> gwern: if you were captain branwen, what would your five elements be?
[21:18:42] <pompolic> (whereas in a counterfactual world where you don't have the paracosm, you don't see other options so you make it part of your identity, and then it maybe never gets revised)
[21:18:46] <shawwwn> "anime" for sure would be one
[21:18:54] <gwern> shawwwn: OCEAN
[21:18:58] <pompolic> :D
[21:19:02] <shawwwn> ... ocean?
[21:19:05] <shawwwn> I didn't expect that
[21:19:16] <catern> lol
[21:19:22] <pompolic> i was going to suggest gwernpastes and link popups
[21:19:24] <PapuaHardyNet> pompolic: the way I broke free (or couldn't assimilate) into the culture of the place I'm born in is because of access to tons of books
[21:19:35] <PapuaHardyNet> and because I was super lonely and I would read a lot of novels
[21:19:39] <pompolic> oh yeah i don't want to discount that
[21:19:53] * gwern puzzles over 'poonnail' until he sees it's an OCR error of 'potential'
[21:19:55] <PapuaHardyNet> by the time I hit highschool I hit the point of no return hahahah
[21:20:12] <pompolic> e.g. i had this all but would've still fallen for one meme
[21:20:23] <gwern> shawwwn: ie https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits
[21:20:24] <Robomot> Big Five personality traits - Wikipedia (The Big Five personality traits is a suggested taxonomy, or grouping, for personality traits,[1] developed from the 1980s onwards in psychological trait theory. When factor analysis (a statistical technique) is applied to personality survey data, it reveals semantic associations: some words used to describe aspects of personality are often applied to the same person. …)
[21:20:41] <pompolic> a lot of people emitted statements to the tune of "anything not-christianity is a weird sect" 
[21:20:48] <pompolic> or seemed to have such aliefs
[21:20:58] <shawwwn> this is too perfect https://i.imgur.com/89MiNDQ.png
[21:21:10] <shawwwn> I agree that these 5 traits would summon you, yes
[21:21:12] <pompolic> so alternative belief systems ended up in that bucket in my head until i started reading about others
[21:21:16] <gwern> by our powers combined! we are... PERSONALITY!
[21:21:44] <PapuaHardyNet> I see
[21:21:55] <pompolic> and i noticed they have cosmogony and beliefs about afterlife, etc. etc., the same class of things you see in christianity
[21:22:03] <shawwwn> "Some disagreement remains about how to interpret and contextualize the openness factor as there is a lack of biological support for this particular trait compared to the other four traits."
[21:22:46] <pompolic> which shifted them out of that bucket but also made it so that none of them seemed comprehensive. after all if they disagree, at least one of them must be wrong
[21:23:49] <pompolic> and then i went on the internet and assimilated myself into internet-american culture somewhat
[21:25:07] <bildramer> openness is when every point within you is the center of an open ball also contained within you
[21:25:52] <shawwwn> gwern: btw, since the channel is sitting in judgement of me, and there's a high chance that an irreversible ban is still the inevitable outcome, I just wanted to say: working with you has truly been an astonishing waste of time. I'll miss our timewasting; it was the most fun I've had in years.
[21:26:33] <gwern> oh you
[21:27:43] <shawwwn> I suspect that at least one other person here will someday train something on danbooru
[21:27:49] <shawwwn> so it's not entirely hopeless
[21:27:51] <feep> I mean, the last thing I said on the topic was "I'll just want for you to inevitably attack someone" so this is an odd sense of "inevitable"
[21:27:54] <feep> wait*
[21:28:29] <shawwwn> on the other hand, if feep is the only one who's inclined to train on danbooru, then I agree the dream of ganbooru is truly dead
[21:28:56] <feep> I mean, what models can even be trained on 16GB anymore
[21:28:56] <gwern> shawwwn: ? people are training on danbooru right now
[21:29:07] <shawwwn> as feep couldn't train his way out of a potty.
[21:29:23] <shawwwn> that's true, but I meant ganbooru-type training.
[21:29:38] <shawwwn> I thought RHW or shepperd would've CLIP'd it by now 
[21:29:48] <shawwwn> but they seem to be content doing other things.
[21:30:03] <gwern> I'm not sure what about training a diffusion model on danbooru is not ganbooru
[21:30:09] <gwern> other than it not strictly being a gan
[21:30:30] <shawwwn> I just didn't know you were so easily impressed
[21:30:47] <shawwwn> if that was the level of quality you were looking for, then I suppose it's mission accomplished; congratulations
[21:31:19] <gwern> biggan 128px danbooru wasn't great after a day either
[21:31:37] <gwern> neither rome nor tadne were built in a day, and no reason to expect ganbooru to be either
[21:31:50] <gwern> note that diffusion models are sota
[21:32:07] <shawwwn> is the training still happening?
[21:32:17] <gwern> afaik
[21:32:26] <shawwwn> mm, well. I hope so
[21:32:40] <gwern> rivers posted epoch 2 this morning
[21:32:51] <gwern> and neither of them has mentioned shutting things down
[21:32:55] <gwern> so...
[21:33:16] <RiversHaveWings> i posted epoch 3 a bit ago
[21:34:46] <gwern> '10:41 < RiversHaveWings> gwern: 3 epochs https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/kqV0JNA9/demo_000003-6.png' ah yes. should be up to epoch 4 or 5 by now I'd think?
[21:34:49] <Robomot> image/png (1024x1024; 1.9 MB)
[21:35:21] <RiversHaveWings> no, i posted epoch 2 late bc i didn't get to it until i woke up in the morning and checked
[21:35:51] <RiversHaveWings> it is currently about 1/4 of the way to epoch 4
[21:36:19] <gwern> ok
[21:37:20] <gwern> fwiw we ran what I think was at least scores or hundreds of epochs for ours - we'd go a million steps, each step was like 512 images, maybe 4m total? so 512m images exposed so potentially ~128 epochs
[21:38:59] <RiversHaveWings> it is training on an 8x V100 box
[21:39:21] <saturn2> gwern: what do you think about banning shawwwn?
[21:39:36] <gwern> RiversHaveWings: yes, I'm thinking in terms of sample-efficiency here. "after how many epoches would it be reasonable to compare to our biggan danbooru runs?"
[21:39:41] <RiversHaveWings> *nods*
[21:39:54] <RiversHaveWings> how many params were yours
[21:40:22] <gwern> I think they tended to be like 1-200m under default settings? it's only stylegan-ext that got pushed up to 500-1000m
[21:40:39] <gwern> saturn2: when he is on tilt and keeps deliberately crusing for a ban and pushing until he gets it, there's not much to do but ban him
[21:41:13] <RiversHaveWings> i think this one is like 564M params
[21:43:00] <gwern> pretty chonky. that'll take a long time to train. I wonder if that'll be enough to overfit? 4m complex images *is* a lot
[21:45:15] <RiversHaveWings> the overfit models are less useful with CLIP
[21:45:31] <RiversHaveWings> so i started adding dropout2d everywhere (p=0.1) and this helped some
[21:46:33] <RiversHaveWings> we trained a 243M model on 128x128 wikiart (80k images) and it's quite good with CLIP
[21:46:58] <gwern> you shouldn't be regularizing until you know it overfits
[21:47:08] <gwern> now you don't know if this is just learning slowly because of that
[21:48:10] <shawwwn> saturn2: I think you'd have a better chance of getting an answer out of a rock (at least publicly)
[21:48:52] <shawwwn> I'm afraid that your heartless judgements will have to be yours alone
[21:50:06] <shawwwn> as you can see, feep declined to ban, which was somewhat unexpected. But I suppose not too unexpected in hindsight; after all, his worldview is that I am a rule-breaker who gets special treatment, so him taking care of it himself would be yet more special treatment.
[21:50:42] <feep> I see three possible outcomes
[21:50:55] <shawwwn> oh, okay
[21:50:56] <feep> you keep being a dick and not being banned, in that case I should finally understand why that happens
[21:51:04] <feep> you keep being a dick and get banned, okay, problem solved
[21:51:09] <feep> you stop being a dick, okay, problem also solved
[21:51:12] <gwern> RiversHaveWings: at large datasets, the data is all the regularization you need. like large language models use next to no regularization, just a soupcon of weight decay to delight the palate
[21:51:32] <shawwwn> feep: those are in fact all of the logical outcomes! I'm so happy you were able to enumerate them
[21:51:40] <shawwwn> I was worried for a little while that logic and you didn't get along too well, but
[21:51:47] <feep> at any rate, you've been obnoxious but not banworthily so imo
[21:51:48] <shawwwn> my concerns were unfounded
[21:51:56] <feep> and I'm assuming it will wear off
[21:52:03] <shawwwn> it won't.
[21:52:13] <shawwwn> not this time.
[21:53:06] <shawwwn> so there you have it saturn2: "obnoxious, but not banworthily so" is all you have to gratify your nepotist tendencies.
[21:53:36] <RiversHaveWings> gwern: yeah we were going to turn it off when we trained on like laion 400m

Throughout the nineteen-twenties and thirties, dozens of Black activists and intellectuals passed through Moscow. Wherever they went, Russians would give up their place in line, or their seat on a

Two

[23:43:37] <saturn2> it's amazing how well this has worked to distract everyone from geoff anders

[23:49:06] <Robomot> My experience at and around MIRI and CFAR (inspired by Zoe Curzi's writeup of experiences at Leverage) - LessWrong 2.0 viewer [Eliezer Yudkowsky 18 Oct 2021 15:33 UTC 42 pointsParentI could be very wrong, but the story I currently have about this myself is that Vassar himself was a different and saner person before he tried some psychedelics.  :( :( :(Viliam 18 Oct 2021 17:35 UTC 3 pointsParentThat… must have hurt …
[23:49:07] <Robomot> …a lot …] (I appreciate Zoe Curzi's revelations of her experience with Leverage.  I know how hard it is to speak up when no or few others do, and when people are trying to keep things under wraps. I haven't posted much publicly about my experiences working as a researcher at MIRI (2015-2017) or around CFAR events, to a large degree because I've been afraid.  Now that Zoe has posted about her experience, I find it ea…
[23:49:08] <Robomot> …sier to do so, especially after the post was generally well-received by LessWrong.)
[23:49:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> So the real takeaway of aaaaaalll of this
[23:49:31] <Obormot\Arcturus> is that DRUGS ARE BAD
[23:49:57] <Gurkenglas> drugs are variance
[23:50:38] <Obormot\Arcturus> No! That's exactly what they're not!
[23:51:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> Literally this whole story turns out to be "Michael Vassar took psychedelic drugs and went crazy and then started going around getting other people to take psychedelic drugs, resulting in many other people going crazy"
[23:51:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> Every damn crazy thing involved in this entire situation turns out to be explained by fucking drugs
[23:52:12] <Gurkenglas> yeah ok some drugs are bad
[23:52:20] <Gurkenglas> i was defending amphetamines in particular ^^
[23:52:48] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yeah I had specific classes drugs in mind, not "everything which could conceivably be called a 'drug'"
[23:53:44] <catern> I can't believe Obormot thinks food and drink are bad
[23:54:35] <Gurkenglas> point conceded more than any other point i have conceded to obormot that i can remember, how do you say "asche auf mein haupt" in english
[23:54:49] <Obormot\Arcturus> Uh, good question
[23:55:09] <catern> egg on my face
[23:55:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yeah probably
[23:55:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> catern: Now that I can't derive enjoyment from food, I plan to become a supervillain, with a mission to destroy all food and drink
[23:55:53] <catern> afaict it's not that close in usage, but at least it reads similarly :)
[23:55:58] <catern> Obormot\Arcturus: oh that makes sense
[23:56:17] <gwern> catern: ultimate talmudic judo: arguing your oppponents are right in refuting you but are reasoning poorly. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natan_Slifkin 'Rabbi Natan Slifkin, with a black-and-white ruffed lemur.' what a chad
[23:56:18] <Robomot> Natan Slifkin - Wikipedia (Natan Slifkin (also Nosson Slifkin) (Hebrew: נתן סליפקין‎; born 25 June 1975 in Manchester, England), popularly known as the "Zoo Rabbi", is a British-born Israeli Modern Orthodox rabbi (non-pulpit serving) and director of the Biblical Museum of Natural History in Beit Shemesh, Israel. …)
[23:57:35] <catern> gwern: yes, very Jewish
[23:58:15] <catern> (well, as far as my understanding of Jewishness via Scott Alexander is accurate)
[23:58:19] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Slifkin's books, which had "cautious references to evolutionary theory", led to a denunciation of his work by ultra-Orthodox authorities.[1] The rabbis object to the tone of Slifkin's work, stating that "even what is not heretical is expressed in a way only a heretic would speak."[2] " ... lol
[23:59:23] <LeoTal> Sure, lol, but they're correct! We know damn well he's a heretic, we just also know his heresy is correct
