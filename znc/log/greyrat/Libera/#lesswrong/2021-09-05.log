[00:12:12] <ggreer> I sometimes went to gettogethers at various rationalist group houses. they were pretty similar to nerdy dorms in college, but not poor. that said construction in the bay area is usually old and shitty, so noise is a huge problem
[00:12:35] *** Joins: adiabatic (~adiabatic@user/adiabatic)
[00:14:01] <kuudes> would it make sense to renovate the housing indoors if one would buy housing from bay area?
[00:14:23] <kuudes> I mean, construction costs should be cheaper than buying housing there, I would think
[00:14:34] <kuudes> and likely you could not alter looks from outside
[00:14:35] <ggreer> you can't renovate. you need permission from the government to change anything
[00:14:39] <kuudes> yes
[00:14:41] <ggreer> including the internal structure
[00:14:56] <kuudes> which is why I proposed to keep the internal structure as-is and just build new housing on top of the flooring etc
[00:14:58] <ggreer> also often these houses are rented and the landlord won't give permission to pay for renovatiosn
[00:15:17] <kuudes> you would lose some centimeters of room height I suppose
[00:15:32] <kuudes> "room-within-a-room"
[00:15:50] <kuudes> basicly construct an apartment within an apartment
[00:17:05] <ggreer> ah. that's probably very expensive. also you'll have to deal with HVAC issues. in the bay area, most places don't have air conditioning
[00:17:17] <kuudes> outer wall -> Ixxx2yyy3 // 2= old inner wall surface, x = wall structure, y = new internal wall structure, 3= new inner wall surface
[00:17:28] <kuudes> ggreer, yeah, but I would think cheaper than bay area housing
[00:17:45] <kuudes> yeah, you could also construct hvac to your internal walls and roofs
[00:17:57] <kuudes> "throw money at the problem"
[00:18:06] <ggreer> IIRC, the best thing to do is hire contractors under the table (without any permits) and bribe your neighbors to keep quiet about it
[00:18:43] <ggreer> if you do it by the book, even something as simple as replacing the crumbling cement on your driveway can run over $10,000k
[00:18:55] <ggreer> err *$10,000
[00:19:09] <Betawolf> lol

[00:19:29] <Betawolf> that cost disease, man
[00:19:48] <ggreer> an acquaintance of mine bought a 950 square foot house in berkeley for just over $1M. he then spent over $10k to fix the driveway because of all the permits and shit
[00:20:25] <ggreer> it was only later that he understood that you're supposed to do everything illegally
[00:20:56] <Betawolf> the $10k is also mad. Not breaking the law shouldn't only be for the rich.

[00:25:54] <|dbotdan> Robert Fruchtman (@_fruchtose, 2020-06-12 18:58): ‘Hello, world. I'm blown away by the response to my thread last night about ice cream, and how San Francisco planning works—or, uh, doesn't. This thread will explore some parts of how we got into this mess. I don't have much prepared, so this thread may surprise you AND me.’
[00:26:30] <ggreer> for a mere $640 you can end any business or development within 500ft of your home
[00:27:00] <ggreer> the distance is farther if you're a member of certain neighborhood groups
[00:30:16] <catern> group houses seem like they're more likely to contain poor people
[00:30:45] <catern> which means they're correlated with lots of other dysfunctions
[00:31:04] <ggreer> maybe but rent is usually around $1,000/month
[00:31:05] <kuudes> bay area's poor are richer than other place poors though
[00:31:39] <catern> ggreer: sure but that's poor person rent in the bay area, isn't it?
[00:34:08] <RiversHaveWings> ggreer: What the actual fuck is that.
[00:34:46] <ggreer> terrible governance
[00:36:03] <Betawolf> are they made this terrible to stop them getting in the way of the big tech companies, or is it just a happy byproduct?
[00:36:50] <ggreer> big tech companies have nothing to do with this. if anything they'd prefer to loosen restrictions on building
[00:37:44] <gwern> they definitely do get in the way of the big tech companies, it's just the big tech companies start years or decades in advance and budget billions of dollars to grind through every last obstacle
[00:37:57] <gwern> and even then, they frantically open up offices elsewhere as much as possible
[00:38:13] <quanticle> Yep
[00:38:21] <quanticle> c.f. Microsoft opening an office here
[00:38:33] <kuudes> I guess we can pray for tactical nuke? :-p
[00:38:48] <quanticle> I'm not sure that a tactical nuke would actually help
[00:38:55] <adiabatic> kuudes: tactical would be too small
[00:39:05] <quanticle> "This radioactive crater is a historical monument!"
[00:39:10] <kuudes> yeah, now that I consider, I am unsure people would not still move to bay after it would *also* be radiating
[00:39:23] * gwern kinda wants to read a history of just what it took for apple to build the ufo, but of course, they'd never publish that
[00:40:18] <kuudes> but yes, I think I am in the opinion that living by yourself or with your own family is better than living with changing roommates
[00:40:44] <ggreer> much, but minimum cost to live by yourself in that same area is $2,000/month
[00:40:46] <kuudes> but I understand in bay there are usually no other options
[00:40:50] <kuudes> yeah
[00:41:04] <kuudes> though. if one is employed at FAANG, isn't one able to pay that?
[00:41:15] <kuudes> I mean, 2000/mo is only 24k/y?
[00:42:21] <ggreer> yeah, but it's still a big chunk of your pay. and if you're young and aren't planning on starting a family any time soon, you might as well save up so you can afford to do that in the future
[00:43:31] <gwern> if you're an eager young SWE indulging in the bay area lifestyle how much time are you spending at home anyway?
[00:43:44] <ggreer> yeah it's just a place to sleep and keep your stuff
[00:44:08] <kuudes> how many people live in housecars or similar mobile homes?
[00:44:15] <kuudes> over in bay area, I mean
[00:44:34] <adiabatic> there's gotta be a couple who just live in RVs in their employer's parking lot
[00:44:51] <adiabatic> I see slow-news-day articles about them every so often

[01:18:32] <ggreer> another issue with the P90 and other bullpups is they have a long bar that goes from the trigger to the sear. this means their triggers tend to have more creep and a less clean break
[01:18:42] <ggreer> so they look cool but they're not as fun to shoot
[01:19:25] <rmmh> "As a part of what is called the trigger pre-travel phase, trigger creep refers to the positive movement of the trigger that moves the sear and engages the mainspring of the gun. ... Many shooters, when speaking about creep, refer to the gritty feeling a poor trigger can have."
[01:19:55] <rmmh> oh it's variable resistance?
[01:20:02] <quanticle> Yeah, as cool as the P90 looks, you have to remember it's a gun designed for people whose primary role is not shooting guns

[01:28:03] <quanticle> Is it a meme?
[01:28:04] <rmmh> "the impact-sensitive ingredients are removed and a conductive component is added. The firing pin passes the electric current to the primer case central contact and travels through the primer mixture a distance of .040 to .050 in. The heat generated from the primer's 1000- to 1500-ohm resistance is enough to raise the mix to the ignition point"
[01:28:06] <quanticle> Or is it good?
[01:29:38] <ggreer> it takes less than 10 milliseconds for the firing pin to ignite the primer. if a bullet is going at 2000fps, that's 20 feet of travel time. reducing that to microseconds is... not really important

[01:33:23] <quanticle> Yeah, you're right that isn't the 5.45mm ammo that modern AKs use
[01:33:49] <ggreer> reminds me of that scene in The Dictator where Sacha Baron Cohen wants the missile to be more pointy (because it looks too much like a dick)
[01:34:00] <quanticle> I guess that's the standard round that Chinese AKs use, though
[01:34:35] <quanticle> It seems like 5.8mm is a standard Chinese military round, used by a bunch of their small arms
[01:34:49] <quanticle> So I guess they said it had to be compatible with *their* AK ammo
[01:35:34] <nullcone> Spaced learning is more effective than cramming. A longer time between vaccine doses is more effective. Is this a general property of complex information processing systems? Just biological ones? Coincidence?
[01:35:50] <quanticle> I think it's a coincidence.
[01:36:15] <gwern> mm. it could be the same principle. an infection which hits you repeatedly *is* more important for the immune system to handle
[01:36:34] <gwern> likewise, information that comes up regularly rather than en masse all at once is likely to come up again
[01:36:46] <kuudes> yeah
[01:37:02] <kuudes> btw you americans, have you got/do you plan to get soon third dose?
[01:37:57] <rmmh> whenever it's available / recommended. would be December for me?
[01:38:26] <kuudes> ah
[01:38:37] <kuudes> I thought you guys already have vaccinated everybody willing
[01:38:47] <RiversHaveWings> kuudes: i got my third dose already ofc
[01:38:56] <kuudes> nice!
[01:40:43] <rmmh> essentially. it just hasn't been 8mo
[01:41:11] <kuudes> isn't it just 4 weeks after 2nd dose per cdc?
[01:41:17] <rmmh> no?
[01:42:10] <rmmh> 3rd dose is currently recommended for people with various immune complications
[01:42:28] <rmmh> https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/covid-19-vaccines-us.html#considerations-additional-dose

[01:44:29] <kuudes> hmm. https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/booster-shot.html talks about booster doses (for regular people) being t+ 8 mo from 2nd dose, but additional doses (for immunocompromised) being t+4 weeks from 2nd dose
[01:44:29] <Robomot> COVID-19 Vaccine Booster Shot  | CDC (People who have had 2 shots of Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccines may need to start receiving a COVID-19 booster shot 8 months after their second dose.)
[01:47:27] <rmmh> Yeah, they're talking about it
[01:48:08] <ggreer> seems like it'd be better to wait for the modified vaccine that is tailored to variants
[01:48:25] <ggreer> someone is working on that, right?
[01:48:36] <ggreer> I remember it being listed as a big advantage of mRNA vaccines
[01:49:27] <ivan> if it's less effective you'll need more of it

[01:50:24] <Robomot> Will the Army pick a bullpup for its new rifle? Several gun makers have solutions if it does. (As Army leaders look to the service’s next standard issue rifle or carbine, a lot of options are on the table.)
[01:50:24] <quanticle> Will the Army pick a bullpup for its new rifle? No, because the Army will do what the Army always does: invite a bunch of manufacturers, tease them with the prospect of a big contract, and then blue-ball them by deciding after full set of trials that the M16/M4 is still good. The Army does this like every 5-8 years, and somehow gun manufacturers keep falling for it.
[01:50:29] <ggreer> btw, has this been the vaccine with the fewest complications ever? if we gave 4 billion doses of water and then closely monitored people's vitals and health afterwards, I'm pretty sure we'd find approximately as many issues
[01:51:10] <rmmh> seems to be
[01:51:11] <ivan> we should try taht sometime
[01:51:58] <rmmh> have we ever deployed a vaccine with this platform before? They're all just making spike protein in one way or another, not based on an attenuated or dead virus 
[01:52:19] <ggreer> we haven't. there were prototypes with ebola vaccines but nothing with massive rollout
[01:53:26] <ggreer> the other thing I like to throw at vaccine skeptics is the fact that you can find plenty of examples of politicians and experts being total fucking hypocrites about masks and social distancing, but you don't find them doing that with vaccines. they put themselves first in line for vaccines
[01:53:37] <rmmh> I wonder if "abortion free" mrna based vaccine variants would be acceptable to antivaxxers. I doubt it, given motivated reasoning. 
[01:58:37] <feepbot> <gwern> 'It’s hard to say exactly where the crop originated or how it came to attain its ultimate towering form. But we do know that it was the Jersey growers who hit upon the bizarre innovation that guaranteed the plant’s fame: kale walking sticks. On the island, after the plants had served their purpose as fodder, they lived a second life. Craftspeople on Jersey dried,
[01:58:37] <feepbot> sanded, varnished, and transformed them into canes. Particularly ingenious growers even discovered a method of digging up their kale and replanting it at a slant, so that the stem would grow into a curved handle. When you hear “kale walking sticks,” what do you imagine? Whatever you’re picturing, I’m willing to bet that the real article is much more elegant: golden brown,
[01:58:37] <feepbot> appealingly knobbly, and extraordinarily light. They were irresistible souvenirs. “Nearly everyone who goes to Jersey brings home a walking-stick made of the dried stalks of Jersey cabbages,” declared an 1899 edition of The Strand Magazine. Tourists were struck with “Jersey fever”—the irresistible desire to own a kale walking stick. Their friends back home would have to
[01:58:42] <feepbot> content themselves with postcards of farmers grinning up from the shade of their kale forests.'

[02:18:00] * gwern eats his 2 beyond meat burger patties. kinda meh. definitely comes off as vaguely hamburger pattyish but you still know it's not. the impossible burger he had in a pittsburgh restaurant was much better, although the comparison is confounded
[02:18:49] <ggreer> IMO impossible is tastier
[02:21:05] <ggreer> beyond burger is vegan and non-GMO. they're trying to get the hemp people. impossible is going after people who like tasty things
[02:24:55] <mjr> It would be nice if Impossible got through the EU red tape sometime...
[02:26:02] <mjr> The EU has its good points, GM regulation is... less so.
[02:26:20] <ggreer> why is it banned in the EU?
[02:26:59] <ivan> as vegan, impossible burger made my stomach very unhappy for a day
[02:27:17] <mjr> Just that their GMO magic ingredient is not approved. It can get approved but it requires going through rather more kafkaesque bureaucracy than the FDA, apparently.
[02:28:35] <mjr> Mind, I'm not sure how much it's laziness from the company that can probably sell everything they make anyway, and how much it's the bureaucracy.

[02:43:33] <kuudes> ggreer, chickenpox vaccine iirc is the most tolerated vaxxine
[02:43:50] <rmmh> chickenpox vaccine has more side effects 
[02:43:50] <kuudes> no one has died to it or any complications related to it since its creation
[02:44:07] <kuudes> something like 55M+ doses used with no death
[02:45:00] <rmmh> oh sure probably no fatalities. but it does cause full chickenpox occasionally, with adult shingles as a recurrent possibility 
[02:45:07] <rmmh> dormant viruses are fascinating 
[02:45:16] <quanticle> rmmh: So it's like celery, then?
[02:45:32] <rmmh> kind of. celery has zinc! 
[02:46:09] <rmmh> but the bioavalability of raw vegetables is atrocious. we don't break down cell walls to any appreciable level. 
[02:47:17] <gwern> rmmh: it must for at least ruminant animals, otherwise the Jersey islanders wouldn't've been growing the tall kale for winter feed

[02:47:48] <rmmh> Humans are only incidental herbivores via cooking 
[02:48:06] <ggreer> I'm curious where the virus lays dormant. how is it just chilling out, not reproducing but not being destroyed?

[02:50:01] <gwern> 'VZV then remains latent in the dorsal ganglion cells of the sensory nerves'
[02:50:54] <ggreer> yeah but how? is it still reproducing but being killed off at approximately the same rate?

[02:51:10] <ggreer> the virus or its DNA must be somewhere
[02:51:35] <gwern> 'All herpesviruses are nuclear-replicating—the viral DNA is transcribed to mRNA within the infected cell's nucleus. Infection is initiated when a viral particle contacts a cell with specific types of receptor molecules on the cell surface. Following binding of viral envelope glycoproteins to cell membrane receptors, the virion is internalized and dismantled, allowing viral DNA to migrate to...
[02:51:41] <gwern> ...the cell nucleus. Within the nucleus, replication of viral DNA and transcription of viral genes occurs. During symptomatic infection, infected cells transcribe lytic viral genes. In some host cells, a small number of viral genes termed latency-associated transcript (LAT) accumulate, instead. In this fashion, the virus can persist in the cell (and thus the host) indefinitely. While primary...
[02:51:47] <gwern> ...infection is often accompanied by a self-limited period of clinical illness, long-term latency is symptom-free. Chromatin dynamics regulate the transcription competency of entire herpes virus genomes. When the virus enters a cell, the cellular immune response is to protect the cell. The cell does so by wrapping the viral DNA around histones and condensing it into chromatin, causing the...
[02:51:53] <gwern> ...virus to become dormant, or latent. If cells are unsuccessful and the chromatin is loosely bundled, the viral DNA is still accessible. The viral particles can turn on their genes and replicate using cellular machinery to reactivate, starting a lytic infection.[14]' https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herpesviridae
[02:51:54] <Robomot> Herpesviridae - Wikipedia (Herpesviridae is a large family of DNA viruses that cause infections and certain diseases in animals, including humans.[1][2][3] The members of this family are also known as herpesviruses. …)
[02:52:09] <rmmh> So it's lurking in the dna
[02:52:29] <gwern> the summary seems to be that inside those specific dorsal ganglion cells, the chickenpoxe's mRNA is physically inside the nucleus but also physically immobilized into little static chromatin bundles
[02:52:53] <ggreer> wow
[02:52:59] <rmmh> gwern: the pox dna
[02:53:11] <rmmh> Is wrapped in histones
[02:53:13] <gwern> and a few fragments of the viral decisionaking machinery float around, occasionally unwrapping the full pox which will then take over the cell and make another attempt
[02:53:16] <kuudes> so, it mutates the host?
[02:53:49] <gwern> kuudes: I don't see anything about injecting itself into the host chromosomes... is that just retroviruses?
[02:53:58] <quanticle> I think that's just retroviruses
[02:54:16] <quanticle> And btw the more I learn about viruses and molecular biology in general, the more terrified I am of life
[02:54:19] <quanticle> Just... life in general
[02:54:26] <gwern> ah yes, just retrovirus, and the herpesvirus family is *not* retrovirus, so its DNA is just floating around inside the nucleus
[02:54:29] <kuudes> we are a house of cards

[07:13:09] <gwern> probably. there are darker grays that could be used
[07:13:52] <gwern> the question here is more should we color visisted links at all, and I'm thinking of it from the perspective of a binger or occasional visitor and I think it very much is a good idea, even if it adds more UI variation

[07:15:10] <gwern> yes, sometimes

[07:41:27] <rmmh> oh missed the chat
[07:41:33] <quanticle> There's a reason the majority of those cars are "hot hatches"

[07:43:07] <rmmh> ahhh https://i.imgur.com/zAvoAJF.jpg
[07:44:22] <quanticle> Well, I'm not actually sure that helps the Subaru WRX all that much. It still has roughly twice as many drivers with prior speeding convictions as the average car.
[07:45:24] <rmmh> "I used to have a Mustang. I got pulled over multiple times. Every single time, they let me off with a warning and said "I know it's a fast car, I used to have one. Just take it easy." I drove that car for 12 years with zero tickets. When it died, I bought a WRX. Had a speeding ticket within a year. My white male privilege was enough to keep me from getting tickets in a Mustang, but not a WRX."
[07:45:25] <rmmh> ahh, so the secret is that the cops hate foreign cars
[07:45:42] <quanticle> Is there a counterpart chart of the most boring cars? That is cars whose drivers are significantly less likely to have a speeding violation on their records than the national average?
[07:46:17] <quanticle> Well, I'm not sure that theory holds, given that the Dodge Dart and the Dodge Ram both make the list.

[07:52:30] <gwern> quanticle: I was unaware of yellowstone ever being involved, be it 16 or 60 hours

They’re the only country I know of who have the same kind of regulations for hazardous waste and chemical waste as they do for nuclear waste.

[09:16:13] <feepbot> They’re the only ones in the world. The chemical industry in the U.S. has basically said, no, no, don’t go there! [laughs] But I think Germany is right: if one thing needs to be isolated because it’s dangerous, then the other thing—that *never* decays and is also dangerous—needs to be treated in the same way. The EPA does have a standard for deep-well injection of
[09:16:13] <feepbot> hazardous waste—they have a 10,000-year requirement for no return to the surface. That was comparable to what we had here, until the standard for Yucca Mountain got bumped up to a million years by Congress.

[12:02:13] <rmmh> ggreer: but you'd lose the crowd energy, bass, and drugs. Concerts are a lot more than just seeing a song performed live, you know? 
[12:08:41] <nshepperd2> you'll just have to bring your own drugs

[12:28:27] <rmmh> that sounds like work and money 
[12:36:09] <adiabatty> if you're at a Phish concert you can just inhale others'
[12:53:00] <SDr> rmmh, actually you loose neither of those things ^.^
[12:53:39] <SDr> so, I've been, um, doing vrchat raves for the past 3 months   (see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1wUg9HCODU    for the why, and how, and what)
[12:53:41] <Robomot> The Virtual Underground: An Introduction to VRChat's Rave Scene - YouTube (alt: anime girl party time let's gooooooooooooJoin the Discord: https://discord.gg/VuwQ2tSFr7Hit up my stream: http://twitch.tv/straszgamingThe Virtual Under...)
[12:53:44] <SDr> they are _awesome_
[12:55:10] <SDr> and so, the group I'm in -shelter- has this map, where you start outside the club, and if instead of heading in, you go around the building, and look behind some innocent-looking furniture, there are speed tables just laying in a drawer
[12:55:27] <adiabatty> what's a speed table?
[12:55:50] <SDr> *tablets
[12:56:28] <SDr> interacting with them initiates this shader (essentially overlays your visual) with stuff, that is _the_ closest I've seen to actual mushroom trips 
[12:56:39] <SDr> and it gets you visual-high :)
[12:57:21] <SDr> after which you can head into the club, with, like, crowds, super great energy, and dancing, and (high-quality headphones given) bass
[12:57:28] <feep> SDr: you are the living instantiation of the cyberpunk future previous generations dreamed of.
[12:57:45] <feep> this could be 1:1 out of snow crash.
[12:57:55] <SDr> feep, also, a catgirl ^.^
[12:57:58] <feep> yes
[12:58:00] <feep> ^^
[13:05:34] <PapuaHardyNet> SDr: does it not feel like you are losing out on the physical elements of a rave?
[13:06:02] <PapuaHardyNet> although let's be honest, you can't go to a physical rave as a cute anime girl, you must use vrchat
[13:06:15] *** Joins: galambo (~galambo@user/galambo)
[13:07:38] <SDr> PapuaHardyNet, so, this gets a bit into phantom touch/phantom sense territory; but essentially, your visual cortex has root access, and priority over all other senses. Which is why around a quarter of my logged-in time in vrc is spent with giving & receiving headpats ^.^   because if your eyes see (eg from a mirror) you being pet, you sorta _feel
[13:07:38] <SDr> that_
[13:07:55] <pompolic> bruh
[13:08:03] <pompolic> i've been procrastinating on getting vrchat operational again
[13:08:14] <PapuaHardyNet> awww
[13:08:37] <pompolic> fwiw, can confirm this sort of phantom sense existing
[13:08:42] <SDr> ((if you read https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/09/05/book-review-surfing-uncertainty/   : the bottom-up senses gets interfering signals, visual wins because it's the most info-dense, and that gets enforced downwards into your touch senses)

[13:08:59] <pompolic> ^ i think something like this is in the background
[13:10:03] <pompolic> i gotta say i really love the idea of shaders as trips
[13:10:35] <SDr> pompolic, and same with a rave party, because your eyes see you dancing with a cute anime girl, you feel like it's there, and it's energizing ^.^
[13:10:42] <PapuaHardyNet> so uh, I use arch linux on x230, can I buy an oculus quest 2 and get vrchat running anyway?
[13:11:22] <pompolic> i know there's VRC for the quest 1, although having to log in with fb would be a dealbreaker for me. i also don't know if there's crossplay
[13:11:23] <SDr> PapuaHardyNet, yes, but also buy a pc with it ^.^
[13:11:40] <PapuaHardyNet> hahahah, looks like I won't be using vr for the next 3 years then
[13:11:59] <pompolic> 2021 bingo card item: "hanging out with The Rationalists in vrchat"
[13:12:13] <SDr> pompolic, there's cross-play, but majority of pc avatars won't load, which means quest players see robots for... virtually every trusted-level user
[13:12:21] <pompolic> ah okay then
[13:12:31] <SDr> "hanging out with The Rationalists in vrchat"  pompolic, there's a discord for that already ;)
[13:12:40] <PapuaHardyNet> ? what vr device do you use SDr
[13:13:01] <SDr> PapuaHardyNet, quest 2 + full body tracking via vive trackers + pc
[13:13:12] <pompolic> i'm sure there is, I'm just very antisocial and probably wouldn't instill it as a habit
[13:13:13] <PapuaHardyNet> what's your investment (financially)
[13:13:36] <PapuaHardyNet> (no, don't write off investments just because you use them for other things)
[13:14:30] <SDr> uh, I'm not sure if it's healthy to think about it too much :) because yes, it is currently my primary addiction, but let's see
[13:15:37] <PapuaHardyNet> 350$ for quest 2 + vive trackers for full body + ~1500$ for an acceptable PC
[13:16:06] <PapuaHardyNet> <2000$? that's kinda acceptable, especially as the PC is a general purpose computing system
[13:16:09] <SDr> ~$2000 for pc + $800 for an rtx 3060 + (first try) $400 for q1 +  3x $200 (base stations) + 3x $150 (trackers)  + then I now moved to quest 2 ($400)
[13:16:34] <PapuaHardyNet> well, I respect your dedication
[13:20:04] <pompolic> speaking of fuzzing your visual cortex
[13:20:39] <pompolic> first thing i implemented when i got my hands on a Quest is a shader that colors an object blue in one eye and yellow in another
[13:21:38] <pompolic> i went on a yakshaving trip thereafter, but I think there's a lot of room for very cursed shaders
[13:22:00] <pompolic> i may post code when it no longer disgusts me
[13:22:40] <SDr> pompolic, so, I actually found very demoscene-like thingies in vrchat:  audio-visual thingies, half-shader half-model'd, but, like, _in vr_
[13:22:52] <pompolic> nice
[13:23:18] <SDr> which..... for me, it experientially obsoleted the pc demoscene  as "biggest superstimuli I can get per second"
[13:23:26] <pompolic> hahahaha
[13:23:45] <SDr> these things stream _straight into your retina_ 
[13:23:58] <pompolic> it also enables things that aren't possible in normal 3d rendering
[13:24:20] <pompolic> like the idea with the above was relying on the visual cortex's merging of images to render blueyellow
[13:24:29] <pompolic> stereoscopic rendering woo
[13:25:14] <pompolic> if i were to make VR demos, i would be focusing on this
[13:26:34] <pompolic> i can imagine a puzzle game based on this too
[13:29:15] <pompolic> Control also had some cool looking effects, with the rainbow-red smoke that enemies explode into
[13:29:22] <pompolic> implementing that on a budget would be neat

[19:53:35] <nshepperd2> those illustrations are extremely lol
[19:57:24] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: given all the medievalism, wouldn't surprise me if directly inspired
[19:58:52] * gwern looks at lw2 and is disgruntled to see even lw2 has a:visited while gwern.net does not
[20:01:41] * Obormot\Arcturus shrug
[20:01:51] <Obormot\Arcturus> LW and gwern.net are pretty different sites
[20:07:41] <gwern> they're similar in terms of being heavily interlinked / text / wiki / deep / long
[20:12:43] <Obormot\Arcturus> But different in terms of LW being a constant stream of new content units
[20:13:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> People post new things all the time but barely anyone ever edits anything
[20:13:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> So "I visited the resource at the URL pointed to by this hyperlink" conveys a lot of information
[20:13:40] <Obormot\Arcturus> On gwern.net, that same bit conveys very little info
[20:14:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yes, you visited this page once. Did you read all of it? Has it changed since? Had entire sections added, or removed? Who knows?
[20:15:10] <Obormot\Arcturus> And what about stuff like tag links? So you click on, say, the AI tag link, and now the "AI" tag link on every page tagged "AI" is marked "visited". Ok...?
[20:15:18] <gwern> I don't think people reread them *that* much, and for the most part, pages are fairly static. yeah, I add links constantly to many pages but it's not like those are pulled out or listed usefully
[20:16:14] <gwern> (anyway, I should implement :visited now. let's see. needs to be a new color in colors.css so it gets inverted for dark mode, and then the underlining is a different thing entirely...)

[20:17:40] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: Without the underlining it's gonna look bad

[20:18:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> Possibly even today
[20:19:20] <gwern> ok. then I guess I'll go back to meditating on how exactly to do link bibliographies... the other link-tag is stable, and I just know that link bibliographies is easy to snap together with the current pieces, I just don't quite see how yet
[20:23:52] <mst> could include a revision id in the URLs that you want to use :visited on
[20:24:08] <mst> where 'revision id' is something you manaully set when something's changed sufficiently
[20:24:12] <mst> think "major version"
[20:24:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> "versioned assets" is the term for this (except it's not traditionally used for content pages - but no reason it can't be)
[20:25:31] <Obormot\Arcturus> But it would be tricky to do this with a static server setup
[20:26:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> Especially given that gwern uses nginx, I believe, and I know nothing about nginx server config
[20:26:21] <gwern> a bigger obstacle is that I don't want to define versioning
[20:26:30] <Obormot\Arcturus> That is indeed an obstacle
[20:26:33] <mst> Obormot\Arcturus: those are more "every git commit"
[20:26:42] <Obormot\Arcturus> mst: Not necessarily
[20:26:54] <mst> I was basically thinking "this is only worth it if you make a human decision on when something's changed sufficiently to deserve a version bump"

[20:27:25] <gwern> I am constantly doing loads of small sitewide edits touching many pages (updating links to avoid redirects, rehosting papers, etc), so file modification time / git patch absolutely does not work, and I found it confused readers a ton when I did have a last-modified timestamp based on those
[20:27:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> mst: But sadly what you describe means even more work for gwern
[20:28:42] <Obormot\Arcturus> Anyway nah it's fine. I think at least some of my concerns will be alleviated by limiting the scope, in a page, where the style is applied. e.g. the tag links issue I described above
[20:28:55] <mst> Obormot\Arcturus: well, yes, but since gwern was saying that lots of changes *didn't* deserve to count as 'not visited anymore', it's either "forget about it entirely" or "do the extra work"

[20:33:35] <gwern> it might be interesting to try to use the GPT-3 API for this to classify 'major' vs 'minor'. do something like loop over every page once a month, and if the last-modified timestamp is more than 1 month old, take the now vs 1-month ago diff, and if more than, say, 20 lines differ, ask the API 'major or minor'; if 'major', bump the last-modified date to the last patch date
[20:34:02] <gwern> hm, or would feeding in the commit messages work better? or feed in both
[20:34:38] <gwern> could probably run this with the human instead of the API to see what it catches
[20:35:01] <gwern> then if one actually does bump dates fairly regularly, one can invest in the API to automate that step

[23:19:30] <gwern> (so codex/API are profitable, but not profitable enough to 'fund the next models'. mostly as expected)
[23:22:14] <gwern> 'I would say Codex is less than a year from deeply affecting your coding' [in response to 'how long until Codex 10xes my programming productivity']
[23:22:47] <gwern> 'are there any plans to make DALL-E public through the API?' 'Yes, it's coming'
[23:23:14] <gwern> .note shawwwn Sam Altman said at the SSC Q&A today: 'are there any plans to make DALL-E public through the API?' 'Yes, it's coming'
[23:23:27] <mst> gotta love copilot adding q_sqrt or whatever it was to their slur list to stop it keeping generating That Quake Function
[23:23:44] <two2thehead> gwern, soon.tiff
[23:23:44] * gwern shrugs. if people are going to be dumb about it, patch it
[23:24:51] <mst> gwern: I have mostly found myself mounting "a skeptic's defence of copilot" when discussing it but that part is still fucking funny
[23:25:59] <gwern> it's like if you use 'niggardly' and people reee about that instead of addressing your actual points - you can choose to troll them and their ignorance/ideology, or you can choose to do whatever it was you intended, but not both, and you are not allowed to complain about whichever choice you make

[23:32:06] <mst> it's more that "we dealt with the problem of it regurgitating copyrighted code verbatim by blacklisting the example of it doing that that everybody was focusing on" entertains me

[23:43:00] <adiabatic> this seems like the most bullshit public firing that's unrelated to current-year pieties
[23:43:28] <gwern> 'We are unable to provide monetary compensation for accepted submissions at this time. We are a team of volunteers, and all funds that we raise go towards administrative costs of running the magazine.'
[23:44:09] <Betawolf> so she wasn't making money anyway
[23:44:22] <Betawolf> somewhat underlining her point
[23:44:25] <gwern> looks like it. I was actually hoping to find that they were funded entirely by the government or something
[23:44:33] <gwern> but I'll settle for 'they literally can't pay a single person'
[23:45:10] <Betawolf> "poetry is very powerful and important, also we have no value-points to award people for poetry"
[23:45:36] <adiabatic> I don't even see the meter in the poetry in Gray Mirror
[23:45:41] <gwern> 'in fact the people are in fact listening'
[23:52:48] <gwern> 'So I will attempt to counter the Larry Tesler bias and cut the model some slack. Instead of trying to poke holes into an idea, I will let myself be guided by (cherrypicked) suggestions from #IAN sometimes. Why can’t I get a tattoo just because an AI told me to?10 Why can’t I draw a “use of Kurt Gödel’s incompleteness theorem”?'
[23:54:07] <gwern> 'As some people have pointed out to me later, the arguments that I am providing in this section are not at all soothing and only tangentially related to the reasons for why they originally said “Oh no”. To this, I can only say “Oh well”.'
