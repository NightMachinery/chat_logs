[18:58:36] <Casper> DarthGandalf, added dev and legacy under firrre-dev and firrre-legacy 
[18:59:39] <DarthGandalf> your branch is not inherited from it though?

[23:32:56] <Ramses> CoreISP did you use the webpage to add channels later?
[23:34:05] <CoreISP> Ramses: looking in to that now :) First trying to figure out why it won't do SASL, it appears to be hating some special characters or pruning the password haha
[23:34:33] <Ramses> ok
[23:34:44] <Ramses> are you using the sasl module?
[23:35:28] <CoreISP> I've enabled that module yup 
[23:35:49] <CoreISP> I think i've mistaken the password field next to the server for the server password field, looks that's not where to enter the SASL auth details 
[23:36:03] <Ramses> no
[23:36:25] <CoreISP> Ahh crap there's seperate documentation for that sorry
[23:36:27] <CoreISP> reading that now
[23:36:27] <Ramses> you use /msg *sasl help, then fill in user and password
[23:36:55] <Ramses> =)
[23:37:32] <Ramses> and use the mechanism of choice
[23:38:04] <Ramses> if no cert you can use PLAIN
[23:38:57] <CoreISP> There a major advantage to using a cert when connecting using SSL? 
[23:39:17] <CoreISP> Not going to deny I'm lazy enough not to generate one if it's not strictly necessary
[23:39:38] <Ramses> nah i use plain, havent bothered on cert on my new vps
[23:39:43] <CoreISP> Alrighty :)
[23:40:32] <CoreISP> Aye that works a lot better :) Thanks 
[23:40:41] <Ramses> np
[23:40:51] <CoreISP> So I see when I connect using my IRC client when I join channels it automagically adds them - is that configuration kept?
[23:40:59] <CoreISP> Is a lot less hassle then adding them one by one by one by one from the web client
[23:41:32] <Ramses> oh never tried that
[23:41:55] <CoreISP> Wonder if that's the "chansaver" module
[23:42:06] <CoreISP> This module updates your znc.conf when you join or part channels, so that you don't lose any channels when ZNC restarts or dies for some reason. You shouldn't use autojoin feature on your client when ChanSaver is loaded.
[23:42:07] <CoreISP> Guess it does
[23:42:11] <Ramses> i use to add user and port, then add channels with network :)
[23:42:24] <Ramses> seems so :)
[23:43:00] <Ramses> the then part is on the webpage
[23:43:41] <CoreISP> Hmmm actually it seems to save them without the chansave module, but let me try what happens when I forcefully restart znc rather than using *status to reconnect
[23:43:53] <Ramses> yup
[23:44:42] <CoreISP> Still keeps it, nice
[23:44:49] <Ramses> good 
[23:46:33] <CoreISP> This article https://wiki.znc.in/ZNC_Memory_Usage mentions "1.8.2-git". Mine just says "1.8.2". Is the memory usage still similar that you happen to know of? :) It seems to be able to hold a *much* larger buffer size without having insane memory usage
[23:47:14] <CoreISP> 145MB with 276 channels and an average buffer size of 500K seems more than reasonable :P
[23:47:48] <Ramses> uhm never looked at that part, just tried with buffers to see what my clients can handle 
[23:48:14] <Ramses> yeah :)
[23:49:37] <CoreISP> Alright, guess it's working well so far then haha. I'll continue setting this up in a bit and then test it out remotely, thanks a lot for your help Ramses :) 
[23:50:03] <Ramses> No problem, good luck!
