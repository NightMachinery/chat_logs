[10:20:38] <FromDiscord> <Rika> just dont await it

[10:21:09] <FromDiscord> <Rika> or if you have a `futures` seq
[10:21:12] <FromDiscord> <Rika> it reads really nicely

[13:16:18] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> It works
[13:16:37] <FromDiscord> <planetis> oh I saw the macro and assumed you wrote it because fieldpairs didn't work
[13:16:58] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Which macro?
[13:17:24] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> `migrateData`?
[13:17:50] <PMunch> @Elegantbeef, I've got another nice project coming up for February ;)
[13:17:59] <FromDiscord> <Phil> How did I express "only positive number" as a type again if I don't really want to specify an upper limit?
[13:18:04] <FromDiscord> <planetis> yes
[13:18:12] <FromDiscord> <Phil> I know I could use a range but that means myself stating "at most up to this number"
[13:18:19] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> `a: Positive`
[13:18:39] <FromDiscord> <Phil> Thanks!
[13:19:05] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> `migrateData` calls `migrate` until it gets to `MyType[Ver.High]`
[13:19:11] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> This is how it works statically
[13:19:34] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> That can be changed but the when statement was the simplest
[13:20:23] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> so in the case of `ver00` `migrateData` is turned into `migrate(migrate(personData))`
[13:20:57] <FromDiscord> <planetis> yes I thought of having when outside the object declaration but then you will have too many duplicate versions for objects
[13:21:02] <PMunch> I mean Positive still has a limit, but probably one you won't find
[13:21:42] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Yea i mean you can do it eitherway, but doing when outside of the object declaration doesnt really allow you to have this easy system
[13:21:49] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Each type would be versioned by name instead i suppose
[13:22:37] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> This was just the idea i had last night, might clean it up, but i dont know
[13:23:25] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> I do really like the simplicity of how this versions
[13:24:19] <FromDiscord> <planetis> its nicely done

[19:07:41] <FromDiscord> <ajusa> maybe Araq's changed his view after 7 years, maybe not
[19:14:27] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> In reply to @Patitotective "https://github.com/nim-lang/Nim/pull/19480 🙃": the naming, is kind of meh (commented on the PR in  more details), but `ritems` and `rpairs` that I wrote for myself were really useful,
[19:15:40] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> In reply to @ajusa "https://github.com/nim-lang/Nim/issues/2457#issueco": `items` covers "iterate strictly from left to right" + "iterate over whatever", and `ritems` extends the built-in set of operations to "iterate from right to left", so I bet in this case we would see similar response - the functionality extension is not especially big
[19:15:55] <FromDiscord> <konsumlamm> what would the mutable version be then? `mritems`?
[19:16:05] <FromDiscord> <ajusa> hey there mr. items
[19:16:12] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> ir `rmitems`
[19:16:20] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> yes, `sudo rm items`
[19:17:05] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> `reversed` already exists in the `std/algorithm`, and returns a revesed copy
[19:17:13] <FromDiscord> <ajusa> I think a reversed iterator would look better
[19:17:49] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> reversed/sorted and other. "ed" parts already imply the modified copy, IIRC that is even in the naming guide
[19:18:03] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> also, they mirror `items` and `pairs`, so naming should reflect that as well

[19:19:01] <FromDiscord> <konsumlamm> except `pairs` shouldn't really be used anymore
[19:19:05] <FromDiscord> <ajusa> I feel like dup should be used to implemented the copied versions though
[19:19:11] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> In reply to @konsumlamm "except `pairs` shouldn't really": why?
[19:19:21] <FromDiscord> <konsumlamm> because we have `std/enumerate`
[19:19:32] <FromDiscord> <ajusa> isn't the whole point of `dup` that it converts an inplace algorithm to a copy?
[19:19:37] <FromDiscord> <konsumlamm> which doesn't require newly implementing it for everything
[19:20:41] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> maybe `ritems` and `rpairs` can be a generic iterator
[19:20:53] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> and `items` for that matter as well
[19:22:08] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> well, whatever, not like I especially care about the naming here, so
[19:22:45] <FromDiscord> <Patitotective> In reply to @ajusa "https://github.com/nim-lang/Nim/issues/2457#issueco": what about `iterutils`?
[19:22:47] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> I just find `pairs` for sequence a lot more useful than importing `enumerate` all over the place
[19:23:11] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> but enumerate is more generic
[19:24:57] <FromDiscord> <Patitotective> In reply to @haxscramper "the naming, is kind": Yea, I prefer them, it sounds like right-to-left

[19:47:08] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> It is installable from nimble, no issues here
[19:47:51] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> The package itself didn't disappear, just nobody even tags it properly, looks into issues or PRs and so on
[19:48:54] <FromDiscord> <ajusa> In reply to @haxscramper "*muffled curses*": Poor hax

[22:54:47] <FromDiscord> <Waldecir Santos> can someone help with a cryptic message ? and why open a file and executing a regex would need to convert to int32 🤔 https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/371759389889003532/938152922695467008/unknown.png
[22:55:23] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> you can't use `re` from `std/re` at compile time
[22:55:49] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> specifically this message means that implementation uses `cast[]` somewhere and vm can't evaluate it
[22:56:30] <FromDiscord> <Waldecir Santos> Oh I see, I cannot use const here, right ?
[22:57:24] <FromDiscord> <konsumlamm> `const` makes stuff run at compile time
[22:57:28] <FromDiscord> <konsumlamm> so no
[22:57:48] <FromDiscord> <Waldecir Santos> Yeah it works with let, but still, would be nice to have a better message, thank you @haxscramper
[22:57:51] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> use `let` instead, it is also immutable
[22:59:35] <FromDiscord> <konsumlamm> the whole module should probably have a `when nimvm: {.error: "'std/re' module doesn't work at compile time".}` or something
[23:00:00] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> this is a vmgen error
[23:00:23] <FromDiscord> <enthus1ast> is std/re the one that uses pcre?
[23:00:31] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> the module can't have a "usable in vm" or "not usable in vm" property
[23:00:54] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> Only proc can, and only in cases where it's implementation has some magic
[23:00:57] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> `cast[]` etc.
[23:01:19] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> So technically if it was a different cast, or some other magic, the `std/re` would've been usable at compile-time
[23:01:23] <FromDiscord> <konsumlamm> hmm, wdym? the error would get triggered when importing it, or am i missing something?
[23:01:25] <FromDiscord> <Yepoleb> is cast not allowed for security reasons?
[23:01:26] <FromDiscord> <Waldecir Santos> Another funny behaviour `re.split` works differently from `nre.split` is this expected ?
[23:01:47] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> In reply to @Yepoleb "is cast not allowed": cast is not disallowed, just not cast are supported
[23:02:03] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> you can do some basic casting with integer types
[23:02:21] <FromDiscord> <Yepoleb> but is that lack of support intentional?

[23:02:33] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> no,
[23:02:47] <FromDiscord> <konsumlamm> it's more that noone bothered to make it work at compile time
[23:02:48] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> there is no real reason to limit the cast in the vm
[23:04:07] <FromDiscord> <konsumlamm> though `std/re` uses PCRE (i.e. C FFI) anyway, so i doubt there's any hope that it'll ever work in the VM
[23:07:19] <FromDiscord> <konsumlamm> In reply to @konsumlamm "the whole module should": @haxscramper can you elaborate why this wouldn't work?
[23:08:03] <FromDiscord> <konsumlamm> or would that get triggered when compiling the module?
[23:08:07] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> first of all, does this work?
[23:09:14] <FromDiscord> <konsumlamm> huh, `illegal context for 'nimvm' magic`

[23:10:13] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> `when nimvm` is a special magic that behaves differently during codegen part of the compilation IIRC, so it can trigger only when the actual evaluation happens

[23:19:15] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> Good error message for this can probably be achieved by tracking vm codegen stack, and then creating something like "XX cannot be done in VM, error found during genration of A which calls B which calls C which calls D which has troubles"
[23:21:32] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> this is doable, in theory, but I'm not all too well familliar with the VM internals to give a concrete suggestions on how this can be implemented,
[23:23:22] <FromDiscord> <konsumlamm> i'm completely lost rn, why can i suddenly not use `when nimvm` in a proc?
[23:23:36] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> you can
[23:23:41] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> that is the only place where you can use it
[23:24:12] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> and in a couple of similar places probably
[23:24:21] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> but not on the module toplevel
[23:24:39] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> because module as a whole is not subject to the vm generation
[23:25:00] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> For example, you can have a `echo 1` and `static: echo 1`, but only latter one will be generated to the vm
[23:25:15] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> and executed
[23:25:28] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> first one will go into the C/js/cxx codegen and executed at runtime
[23:25:32] <FromDiscord> <konsumlamm> just doing `when nimvm: discard` and i'm getting `illegal context for 'nimvm' magic`

[23:26:16] <FromDiscord> <IsaacPaul> you're missing the code for when there isn't a nimvm?
[23:26:34] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> @konsumlamm maybe `else` is required
[23:26:35] <FromDiscord> <konsumlamm> oh lol, you need an `else`
[23:26:39] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> I don't exactly remember
